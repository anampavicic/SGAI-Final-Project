Agricultural products include [[mango]]es in the summer and [[guava]] and other citrus fruits [[Orange (fruit)|orange]]  in the winter.

Recent years have seen Vehari struggle for rainfall even during the usually busy monsoon season. When rainfall is light rainfall the land is generally arid and dusty.

==History==
Vehari district was created in 1976 when it was cut off from Multan district.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Our History {{!}} Vehari |url=https://vehari.punjab.gov.pk/our-history |access-date=2022-09-16 |website=vehari.punjab.gov.pk}}</ref> Vehari District was an agricultural region with forests during the [[Indus Valley civilization]]. The [[Vedic period]] is characterized by [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]]. The [[Abhira tribe|Abhira]] / [[Ahir]], [[Kambojas]], [[Daradas]], [[Kekaya|Kaikayas]], Madras, [[Pauravas]], [[Yaudheya]]s, [[Malavas]] and [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]]s invaded, settled and ruled ancient [[Punjab region]]. After overrunning the [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenid Empire]] in 331 BCE, [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] marched into present-day [[Punjab region]] with an army of 50,000. The Vehari was ruled by [[Maurya Empire]], [[Indo-Greek kingdom]], [[Kushan Empire]], [[Gupta Empire]], [[Hephthalite Empire|White Huns]], [[Kushano-Hephthalites]] and the [[Turk Shahi|Turk]] and [[Hindu Shahi]] kingdoms.

In 997 CE, [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi]], took over the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid dynasty]] empire established by his father, [[Sabuktigin|Sultan Sebuktegin]]. In 1005, he conquered the [[Hindu Shahi|Shahi]]s in [[Kabul]] and followed it by the conquests of [[Punjab region]]. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later [[Mughal Empire]] ruled the region.

After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the [[Sikh Empire|Sikhs]] invaded and occupied Vehari District. During the period of [[British Raj|British rule]], Vehari district increased in population and importance.

Vehari District is the result of construction of the [[Pakpattan]] canal from Sulemanki Head Works on the [[Sutlej]] and the institution of Nili Bar [[colony]] project in 1925, so called because of the hints of blue in the water of the Sutlej. The ancient history of the district is obscure. The populated areas in ancient times was restricted to the banks of the river Sutlej where seasonal inundation permitted some [[Tillage|cultivation]]. The rest of the area was a vast sandy scrap-land at best affording pastures itinerant herdsmen. The [[riparian]] tract formed the state of Fatehpur during the time of [[Akbar|Akbar the Great]]. This was ruled by Fateh Khan of Joya family who founded and gave his name to the town of Fatehpur. (Fatehpur is still in existence about 15 kilometres to the south of Mailsi and is the oldest town of Mailsi subdivision. It has some remains of archaeological value.) [[Pakistan Movement]]. After the [[Partition of India|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, the minority [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s migrated to [[India]] while the [[Muslim]] refugees from India settled in the Vehari District.

The main castes in Vehari are Rao Rajput, Jatt, Dhudhi-Rajput, Joyia-Rajput, Sheikh, Bhatti-Rajput, Baloch, Khokhars, Daha, Gujjar, Aheer, Arian, Sial, Awan, Langrial.

==Transport==
[[File:Tehsil Vehari Map.jpg|thumb|Tehsil Vehari and villages]]
[[File:Vehari Railway Station.jpg|thumb|[[Vehari railway station]]]]
Vehari is on the southern alternate route of railway and road between [[Multan]] and [[Lahore]], the capital of the province.

The northern route is the main route. Both run roughly in a northeasterly direction, almost parallel to each other and only 20 to 30 miles apart at any point. A section of the railway between Multan and Lahore was electrified on the main line between [[Khanewal]] and Lahore during the 1960s; however, in subsequent decades and lately with rapid decline and deterioration of the infrastructure of Pakistan Railway (PR), the electrified section lies in ruins and is not likely to be restored in the foreseeable future. With the new motorway between Multan and Lahore which was due to be completed sometimes in the early part of 2014, Vehari is set to benefit from its proximity to its north.

==Culture==

The Vehari route goes to Lahore through the religiously renowned city of [[Pakpattan]], where the [[Sufism|Sufi]] Saint Syedna [[Fariduddin Ganjshakar]] رحمه الله is buried. Thousands of pilgrims come annually to Pakpattan for the saint's [[Urs]] celebration which include all sorts of festivities. Selections from his work are included in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the [[Sikh]] sacred scripture. He was commonly known as "Baba Farid". [[Power Radio FM 99 (Pakistan)|Power Radio FM 99]] has a station for Vehari.

==Climate==
The climate of the district is hot and dry in summer and cold in winter Amin et al. (2017). The maximum and minimum temperature ranges between 45&nbsp;°C and 28&nbsp;°C in summer. During winter, the temperature fluctuates between 21&nbsp;°C and 5&nbsp;°C.
