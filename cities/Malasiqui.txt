'''Malasiqui''', officially the '''Municipality of Malasiqui''' ({{langx|pag|Baley na Malasiqui}}; {{langx|ilo|Ili ti Malasiqui}}; {{langx|tl|Bayan ng Malasiqui}}), is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Pangasinan]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 143,094 people.{{PH census|current}}

Malasiqui is {{convert|26|km}} from [[Lingayen]] and {{convert|193|km}} from [[Manila]].

==Etymology==
The word ''Malasiqui'' originates from the Pangasinan root word ''lasi'' meaning lightning.  With prefix ''ma'' indicating high degree and suffix ''qui'' indicating place - Malasiqui means "place full of lightning".

Another version was that of three Spanish priests while conducting ocular during those days, were so pissed off with the condition of the road which was muddy. The first priest said "mala" which means bad. The second priest responded "si" which means yes. The third one apparently not paying attention asked "que?"  or "what". The local folk who overheard the conversation mistook it as if they are naming the town. And so it came to be known as ''Mala Si Que?'' or the current name spelled as Malasiqui.

==History==
The Municipality traces its origins during the middle of the 17th century when Spanish friars opened a mission intended to convert the native population to Catholicism. The most probable founding year was 1671 when Spanish civil authorities in Manila gave the license for the creation of the town. There were no organized communities in the area before the Spaniards arrived. Attempts to group families into a settlement may have started as early as 1665. The present site was then heavily forested with small family groups scattered along banks of small rivers and creeks. The socio-political history of the municipality parallels that of the Pangasinan province and the country in general. Its history is punctuated by periods of foreign domination first by the Spanish, then by the United States and briefly by the Japanese during the 2nd World War. The population participated heavily in some of the bloodiest rebellions during the Spanish period. Catholicism and other Christian sects dominate the religious life of the people.  Ethnically, it is one of the few places in the province of Pangasinan which did not experience in-migration from other regions of the country. Consequently, Pangasinanse is the dominant ethnic group with almost no other ethnic groups mixing into the locality.

The poblacion or town center, is recently experiencing high commercial growth spurred mainly by high consumer spending generated by increase in family incomes attributable to earnings of OFWs (Overseas Filipino Workers). The estimate of OFW population as a percentage of adult labor force is as much as 22% - one of the highest rates in the Philippines. The OFW phenomenon is so significant that almost all households have at least one member working outside of the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pangasinan.org/malasiqui/|title=pangasinan.org|website=pangasinan.org}}</ref>
