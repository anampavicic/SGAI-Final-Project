Wichita began as a trading post on the [[Chisholm Trail]] in the 1860s and was incorporated as a city in 1870. It became a destination for [[Cattle drives in the United States|cattle drives]] traveling north from [[Texas]] to Kansas railroads, earning it the nickname "Cowtown".<ref name="magic">Miner, Craig (Wichita State Univ.

In the 1920s and 1930s, businessmen and aeronautical engineers established aircraft manufacturing companies in Wichita, including [[Beechcraft]], [[Cessna]], and [[Stearman Aircraft]]. The city became an aircraft production hub known as "The Air Capital of the World".<ref name="we_built_2018_09_smithsonianmag">[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/air-space-magazine/04_sep2018-spirit-of-wichita-1-180969914/ "We Built This City," September 2019, ''Air and Space Magazine,''] [[Smithsonian Institution]], retrieved March 31, 2023</ref><ref name="wbj_back">McCoy, Daniel (interview with Beechcraft CEO Bill Boisture), "[http://www.bizjournals.com/wichita/print-edition/2013/02/22/back-to-beechcraft.html?page=all Back to Beechcraft]", ''Wichita Business Journal'', February 22, 2013</ref> [[Textron Aviation]], [[Learjet]], [[Airbus]], and [[Boeing]]/[[Spirit AeroSystems]] continue to operate design and manufacturing facilities in Wichita, and the city remains a major center of the American [[aircraft industry]]. Several airports located within the city of Wichita include [[McConnell Air Force Base]],<ref name="capital_story" /><ref name="ks_av" /> [[Colonel James Jabara Airport]], and [[Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport]], the largest airport in Kansas.

As an industrial hub, Wichita is a regional center of culture, media, and trade. It hosts several universities, large museums, theaters, parks, shopping centers, and entertainment venues, most notably [[Intrust Bank Arena]] and [[Century II Convention Hall|Century II Performing Arts & Convention Center]]. The city's [[Old Cowtown Museum]] maintains historical artifacts and exhibits the city's early history. [[Wichita State University]] is the third-largest post-secondary institution in the state.

Claimed first by [[Kingdom of France|France]] as part of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] and later acquired by the United States with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, it became part of [[Kansas Territory]] in 1854 and then the state of Kansas in 1861.<ref>{{cite web | title = Louisiana Purchase | work = Kansapedia | publisher = [[Kansas Historical Society]] | url = http://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/louisiana-purchase/17876 | access-date = 2015-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Kansas Territory | work = Kansapedia | publisher = [[Kansas Historical Society]] | url = http://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/kansas-territory/14701 | access-date = March 21, 2015}}</ref>

Rapid immigration resulted in a [[Speculation|speculative]] land boom in the late 1880s, stimulating further expansion of the city.

===20th century===
In 1914 and 1915, deposits of [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] were discovered in nearby [[Butler County, Kansas|Butler County]]. This triggered another economic boom in Wichita as producers established refineries, fueling stations, and headquarters in the city.<ref name=Price>{{cite book|last1=Price|first1=Jay M.|title=El Dorado : legacy of an oil boom|date=2005|publisher=Arcadia|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=978-0738539713}}</ref> By 1917, five operating refineries were in Wichita, with another seven built in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web | title = Petroleum Refining: A 125 Year Kansas Legacy | publisher = Kansas Department of Health and Environment | url = http://www.kdheks.gov/remedial/articles/refining_history.pdf | access-date = 2015-03-19}}</ref> The careers and fortunes of future oil moguls Archibald Derby, who later founded [[Derby Oil]], and [[Fred C.

The money generated by the oil boom enabled local entrepreneurs to invest in the nascent [[Aerospace manufacturer|airplane-manufacturing]] industry. In 1917, [[Clyde Cessna]] built his [[Cessna Comet]] in Wichita, the first aircraft built in the city. In 1920, two local oilmen invited [[Chicago]] aircraft builder [[Emil Matthew Laird|Emil "Matty" Laird]] to manufacture his designs in Wichita, leading to the formation of the [[Swallow Airplane Company]]. Two early Swallow employees, [[Lloyd Stearman]] and [[Walter Beech]], went on to found two prominent Wichita-based companies, [[Stearman Aircraft]] in 1926 and [[Beechcraft]] in 1932, respectively. Cessna, meanwhile, started [[Cessna|his own company]] in Wichita in 1927.<ref name=Harris>{{cite web | last = Harris | first = Richard | title = The Air Capital Story: Early General Aviation & Its Manufacturers | publisher = In Flight USA | url = http://harris1.net/hold/av/avhist/wichita/aircap_x.htm | date = 2002}}</ref> The city became such a center of the industry that the [[Aerospace Industries Association|Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce]] dubbed it the "Air Capital of the World" in 1929.<ref name="we_built_2018_09_smithsonianmag" /><ref>{{cite book | title = Aeronautical Yearbook, 1929 | publisher = Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Harrow | first = Christopher | title = How is Wichita, Kansas the "Air Capital of the World"? | publisher = International Aviation HQ | url = https://internationalaviationhq.com/2020/02/29/air-capital-of-the-world | date = February 29, 2020}}</ref>

The Arkansas follows a winding course, south-southeast through Wichita, roughly bisecting the city. It is joined along its course by several tributaries, all of which flow generally south. The largest is the Little Arkansas River, which enters the city from the north and joins the Arkansas immediately west of downtown. Further east lies [[Chisholm Creek]], which joins the Arkansas in the far southern part of the city. The Chisholm's own tributaries drain much of the city's eastern half; these include the creek's West, Middle, and East Forks, as well as further south, Gypsum Creek. The Gypsum is fed by its own tributary, Dry Creek. Two more of the Arkansas's tributaries lie west of its course; from east to west, these are Big Slough Creek and Cowskin Creek. Both run south through the western part of the city. Fourmile Creek, a tributary of the [[Walnut River (Kansas)|Walnut River]], flows south through the far eastern part of the city.<ref name=CityMap>{{cite web | title = City of Wichita | publisher = [[Kansas Department of Transportation]] | date = June 2010 | url = http://www.ksdot.org/burtransplan/maps/city-pdf/wichita.pdf | access-date = 2011-01-01}}</ref>

===Climate===
====Climatic influences on weather====
Wichita lies within the [[humid subtropical climate]] zone ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] [[Humid subtropical climate#Breakdown of letters|''Cfa'']]), typically experiencing hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters. Located on the [[Great Plains]], far from any large moderating influences such as mountains or large bodies of water, Wichita often experiences severe weather with thunderstorms occurring frequently during the spring and summer. These occasionally bring large hail and frequent lightning. Particularly destructive ones have struck the Wichita area several times in the course of its history - in September 1965, during the [[Andover tornado outbreak|Andover, Kansas tornado outbreak]] of April 1991, and during the [[1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak|Oklahoma tornado outbreak]] of May 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tornadochaser.com/torhist3.htm|title=Kansas Tornado History - Historical Tornado Facts|publisher=Tornadochaser.com|access-date=2009-09-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327070325/http://www.tornadochaser.com/torhist3.htm|archive-date=March 27, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kansas.com/2009/03/26/749271/1991-wichita-area-tornado.html|title=1991 Wichita-area tornado|access-date=April 21, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820160813/http://www.kansas.com/2009/03/26/749271/1991-wichita-area-tornado.html|archive-date=August 20, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kansas.com/2011/02/23/1732673/wichita-tornado-1965.html|title=Photos: 1965 Wichita tornado|access-date=April 21, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504232713/http://www.kansas.com/2011/02/23/1732673/wichita-tornado-1965.html|archive-date=May 4, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Winters are cold and dry; since Wichita is roughly midway between [[Canada]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]], cold spells and warm spells are equally frequent. Warm air masses from the Gulf of Mexico can raise midwinter temperatures into the 50s and even 60s (°F), while cold-air masses from the Arctic can occasionally plunge the temperature below 0&nbsp;°F.

====Pollen and other allergens====
Wichita is consistently ranked as one of the worst major cities in the nation for seasonal allergies, due largely to tree and grass pollen (partly from surrounding open plains and pastureland), and smoke from frequent burning of fields by the region's farmers and ranchers, driven by the strong Kansas winds.<ref name="allergy_capitals_aafa_org">[https://aafa.org/asthma-allergy-research/allergy-capitals/ "Allergy Capitals,"] website of the [[Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America]], retrieved March 31, 2023</ref><ref name="spring_allergies_2023_03_21_ksn">[https://www.ksn.com/video/wichita-doctors-seeing-an-increase-in-spring-allergies/8489667/ "Wichita doctors seeing an increase in spring allergies,"] March 21, 2023, [[Kansas State Network]], retrieved March 31, 2023</ref>  The [[Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America]], ranked Wichita—out of the nation's 100 largest cities—6th worst for people with allergies in 2016,<ref name="sixth_allergies_2016_04_04_kmuw_org">[https://www.kmuw.org/health/2016-04-04/wichita-ranks-sixth-in-nation-for-spring-allergies " Wichita Ranks Sixth In Nation For Spring Allergies,"] April 4, 2016, [[KMUW-FM]], retrieved March 31, 2023</ref> 3rd worst in 2021,<ref name="wichita_3rd_2021_03_08_kansas_com">[https://www.kansas.com/news/local/article249633108.html "Wichita ranks 3rd in nation for allergies,"] March 8, 2021, ''[[Wichita Eagle]],'' retrieved March 31, 2023</ref> 2nd worst in 2022,<ref name="seasonal_allergies_03_03_kake">[https://www.kake.com/story/45998809/wichita-is-one-of-the-worst-us-cities-for-seasonal-allergies-report "Wichita is one of the worst US cities for seasonal allergies: Report,"] March 3, 2022, [[KAKE-TV]] News, retrieved March 31, 2023, 12</ref> and worst nationwide in 2023.<ref name="allergy_capitals_aafa_org" /><ref name="worst_cities_allergies_2023_03_16_washpost">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/03/16/allergy-season-pollen-count-climate/ "The worst cities in the U.S. for allergies,"] March 16, 2023, ''[[Washington Post]],'' retrieved March 31, 2023</ref><ref name="dallas_wichita_2023_03_17_cbsnews">[https://www.cbsnews.com/video/dallas-wichita-among-hardest-u-s-cities-to-live-for-those-with-allergies-study-finds/ "Dallas, Wichita among the hardest U.S. cities to live for those with allergies, study finds,"] March 17, 2023, [[CBS News]], retrieved March 31, 2023</ref><ref name="wichita_worst_2023_03_17_kansas_com">[https://www.kansas.com/news/local/article273180880.html "Wichita, KS is the worst city in US for those with allergies,"] March 17, 2023, ''[[Wichita Eagle]],'' retrieved March 31, 2023</ref><ref name="wichita_worst_2023_03_17_kake">[https://www.kake.com/story/48569464/wichita-is-ranked-the-worst-us-city-for-allergies "Wichita is ranked the worst US city for allergies,"] March 17, 2023, [[KAKE-TV]] News, retrieved March 31, 2023, 12</ref>

===Neighborhoods===
{{main|Neighborhoods of Wichita, Kansas}}
[[File:Wichita pan 1.jpg|thumb|Downtown Wichita & Century II Convention Center along the [[Arkansas River]]]]

Wichita has several recognized areas and neighborhoods. The [[Downtown Wichita|downtown area]] is generally considered to be east of the Arkansas River, west of Washington Street, north of Kellogg, and south of 13th Street. It contains landmarks such as [[Century II Performing Arts & Convention Center|Century II]], the [[250 Douglas Place|Garvey Center]], and the [[Epic Center]]. Old Town is also part of downtown; this {{Convert|50|acre|km2|adj=on}} area is home to a cluster of nightclubs, bars, restaurants, a movie theater, shops, and apartments and condominiums, many of which make use of historical warehouse-type spaces.

Two notable residential areas of Wichita are [[Riverside, Wichita, Kansas|Riverside]] and [[College Hill, Wichita, Kansas|College Hill]]. Riverside is northwest of downtown, across the Arkansas River, and surrounds the {{convert|120|acre|km2|adj=on}} Riverside Park.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wichitagov.org/CityOffices/Park/Parks.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030814171054/http://www.wichitagov.org/CityOffices/Park/Parks.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 14, 2003|title=Wichita Nightlife and Food - WichitaGov |website=wichitagov.org}}</ref> College Hill is east of downtown and south of Wichita State University.

Four other historic neighborhoods—developed in southeast Wichita (particularly near [[Boeing]], [[Cessna Aircraft|Cessna]] and [[Beech Aircraft|Beech]] aircraft plants) -- are among the nation's few remaining examples of U.S. government-funded temporary [[World War II]] housing developments to support war factory personnel:  Beechwood (now mostly demolished), Oaklawn, Hilltop (the city's highest-density large neighborhood), and massive Planeview (where over 30 languages are spoken) -- in all, home to about a fifth of the city's population at their peak. Though designed as temporary housing, all have remained occupied into the 21st century, most becoming low-income neighborhoods.<ref name="miracle_city">{{cite journal |last=Courtwright |first=Julie |url=https://www.kshs.org/publicat/history/2000winter_courtwright.pdf |title=Want to Build a Miracle City? : War Housing in Wichita |date=2000 |journal=[[Kansas History: A Journal of the Central Plains]] |volume=23 |number=4 |access-date=February 20, 2020}}</ref><ref name="hilltop">''[https://www.wichita.gov/Planning/NR%20Documents/Hilltop%20Neighborhood%20Plan.pdf A revitalization plan for the Hilltop Neighborhood: 60 years of community in southeast Wichita]'' May, 2000, City of Wichita, retrieved February 20, 2020</ref><ref name="community_shocker">Geiszler-Jones, Amy, [http://wsu.wichita.edu/the-shocker/story.php?eid=1&id=228 "Community Health,"] ''The Shocker'', [[Wichita State University]], as posted at [[University of Kansas]] retrieved February 20, 2020</ref><ref name="google_extracts">[https://digital.lib.ku.edu/islandora/object/ku-phog%253A63131/datastream/OCR/download&usg=AOvVaw01MsIj-14nU5xoLoO7K4 OCR extracts from various publications], Google, retrieved February 20, 2020</ref><ref name="planeview_edu">Tihen, Edward, [http://specialcollections.wichita.edu/collections/local_history/tihen/pdf/People&Places/Planeview.PDF "Plainview (sic), Planeview, Beechwood,"], in ''Tihen Notes,''  Special Collections, [[Wichita State University]], retrieved February 20, 2020</ref>

==Economy==

Wichita's principal [[industrial sector]] is [[manufacturing]], which accounted for 21.6% of area employment in 2003. Aircraft manufacturing has long dominated the local economy, and plays such an important role that it has the ability to influence the economic health of the entire region; the state offers tax breaks and other incentives to aircraft manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/12/22/351204/hawker-beechcraft-secures-40-million-incentive-package-to-remain-in.html|access-date=2011-01-02|title=Hawker Beechcraft secures $40 million incentive package to remain in Wichita}}</ref>

[[Healthcare]] is Wichita's second-largest industry, employing about 28,000 people in the local area. Since healthcare needs remain fairly consistent regardless of the economy, this field was not subject to the same pressures that affected other industries in the early 2000s. The Kansas Spine Hospital opened in 2004, as did a critical-care tower at [[Wesley Medical Center]].<ref name="wichitakansas.org"/> In July 2010, Via Christi Health, which is the largest provider of healthcare services in Kansas, opened a hospital that will serve the northwest area of Wichita.

Thanks to the early 20th-century oil boom in neighboring [[Butler County, Kansas]], Wichita became a major oil town, with dozens of oil-exploration companies and support enterprises. Most famous of these was Koch Industries, today a global natural-resources conglomerate. The city was also at one time the headquarters of the former [[Derby Oil Company]], which was purchased by [[Coastal Corporation]] in 1988.

Koch Industries and [[Cargill]], the two largest privately held companies in the United States,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/21/private-companies-10_rank.html|title=Forbes article|work=Forbes}}</ref> both operate headquarters facilities in Wichita. Koch Industries' primary global corporate headquarters is in a large office-tower complex in northeast Wichita. [[Cargill Meat Solutions]] Div., at one time the nation's third-largest beef producer, is headquartered downtown. Other firms with headquarters in Wichita include roller-coaster manufacturer [[Chance Morgan]], gourmet food retailer [[Dean & Deluca]], [[renewable energy]] company [[Alternative Energy Solutions]], and [[Coleman Company]], a manufacturer of camping and outdoor recreation supplies. [[Air Midwest]], the nation's first officially certificated "commuter" airline, was founded and headquartered in Wichita and evolved into the nation's eighth-largest regional airline prior to its dissolution in 2008.<ref>"[http://ows.doleta.gov/dmstree/uipl/uipl2k2/uipl_3002c2a3.html uipl_3002c2a3.html]."

As of 2013, 68.2% of the population over the age of 16 was in the labor force; 0.6% was in the armed forces, and 67.6% was in the civilian labor force with 61.2% employed and 6.4% unemployed. The occupational composition of the employed civilian labor force was 33.3% in management, business, science, and arts; 25.1% in sales and office occupations; 17.2% in service occupations; 14.0% in production, transportation, and material moving; and 10.4% in natural resources, construction, and maintenance. The three industries employing the largest percentages of the working civilian labor force were educational services, health care, and social assistance (22.3%); manufacturing (19.2%); and retail trade (11.0%).<ref name=Census2010/>

The cost of living in Wichita is below average; compared to a U.S. average of 100, the cost of living index for the city is 84.0.<ref name=CityData>{{cite web | title = Wichita, Kansas | publisher = City-Data.com | url = http://www.city-data.com/city/Wichita-Kansas.html | access-date = 2015-03-11}}</ref> As of 2013, the median home value in the city was $117,500, the median selected monthly owner cost was $1,194 for housing units with a mortgage and $419 for those without, and the median gross rent was $690.<ref name=Census2010/>

===Aircraft manufacturing===
[[File:NASA-2000Starship.jpg|thumb|right|[[Beechcraft Starship]] were built in Wichita from 1983 to 1995.]]

From the early to late 20th century, aircraft pioneers such as Clyde Cessna, Emil Matthew "Matty" Laird, Lloyd Stearman, [[Walter Beech]], [[Al Mooney]] and [[Bill Lear]] began aircraft-manufacturing enterprises that led to Wichita becoming the nation's leading city in numbers of aircraft produced, earning Wichita, in 1928, the 1929 title "Air Capital City" from the nation's [[Aerospace Industries Association|Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce]] — a title the city would claim permanently.<ref name="we_built_2018_09_smithsonianmag" /><ref name="borne_south_wind">Rowe, Frank J.

Today, Cessna Aircraft Co. (the world's highest-volume airplane manufacturer) and Beechcraft remain based in Wichita, having merged into [[Textron Aviation]] in 2014, along with [[Learjet]] and Boeing's chief sub-assembly supplier, [[Spirit AeroSystems]]. Airbus maintains a workforce in Wichita, and [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] (parent company of Learjet) has other divisions in Wichita, as well. Over 50 other aviation businesses operate in the Wichita MSA, as well as over 350 suppliers and subcontractors to the local aircraft manufacturers. In total, Wichita and its companies have manufactured an estimated 250,000 aircraft since Clyde Cessna's first Wichita-built aircraft in 1916.<ref name="capital_story" /><ref name="ks_av" /><ref name="borne_south_wind" /><ref name="sampler_air" /><ref name="we_built_2018_09_smithsonianmag" />

In the early 2000s, a national and international recession combined with the after-effects of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]] to depress the aviation subsector in and around Wichita. Orders for new aircraft plummeted, prompting Wichita's five largest aircraft manufacturers, Boeing Co., Cessna Aircraft Co., Bombardier Learjet Inc., [[Hawker Beechcraft]], and [[Raytheon|Raytheon Aircraft Co.]]—to slash a combined 15,000 jobs between 2001 and 2004. In response, these companies began developing small- and mid-sized airplanes to appeal to business and corporate users.<ref name="wichitakansas.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.wichitakansas.org/ |title=Wichita Chamber of Commerce |publisher=Wichitakansas.org |access-date=2013-07-15}}</ref>

The International Student Association at [[Wichita State University]] presents an annual international cultural exhibition and food festival, on the campus at WSU, providing an inexpensive sampling of global culture and cuisine to the general public.

One or more large [[Renaissance fair]]s occur annually, including the "RenFair" in conjunction with the "Kingdom of Calontir" of the SCA ([[Society for Creative Anachronism]]). The fairs vary in length from one day to a week, typically at Sedgwick County Park or [[Newman University (Kansas)|Newman University]].

Wichita suffered severe floods of the Arkansas river in 1877, 1904, 1916, 1923, 1944, 1951 and 1955. In 1944 the city flooded 3 times in 11 days.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tanner|first1=Beccy|title=Ad Astra: Idea for Big Ditch grew after Wichita had sustained series of major floods|url=http://www.kansas.com/news/article1120671.html|website=kansas.com|publisher=The Wichita Eagle|access-date=March 24, 2015|date=August 11, 2013}}</ref>
As a result of the 1944 flood, the idea for the [[Wichita-Valley Center Floodway]] (locally known as the "Big Ditch") was conceived. The project was completed in 1958. The Big Ditch diverts part of the Arkansas River's flow around west-central Wichita, running roughly parallel to the [[Interstate 235 (Kansas)|Interstate 235]] bypass.<ref name=CityMap/><ref>{{cite web | title = Storm Water Management | publisher = City of Wichita | url = http://www.wichita.gov/CityOffices/PublicWorks/StormWater/ | access-date = 2011-01-01 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110219020914/http://www.wichita.gov/CityOffices/PublicWorks/StormWater/ | archive-date = February 19, 2011 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref> A second flood control canal lies between the lanes of [[Interstate 135]], running south through the central part of the city.
