'''Magway Region''' ({{langx|my|မကွေးတိုင်းဒေသကြီး}}, {{IPA-my|məɡwé táiɰ̃ dèθa̰ dʑí|pron}}; formerly '''Magway Division''') is an [[administrative divisions of Myanmar|administrative division]] in central [[Myanmar]]. It is the second largest of Myanmar's seven divisions, with an area of {{convert|17306|sqmi|km2|order=flip|abbr=in}}. Pa Del Dam (ပဒဲဆည်) is one of the dams in [[Aunglan Township]], Magway Division. The capital and second largest city of the Magway Division is [[Magway, Myanmar|Magway]]. The largest city is [[Pakokku]]. The major cities of Magway Division are [[Magway, Myanmar|Magway]], [[Pakokku]], [[Aunglan]], [[Yenangyaung]], [[Taungdwingyi]], [[Chauk]], [[Minbu]], [[Thayet]] and [[Gangaw]].

==Geography==
Magway Region sits approximately between north latitude 18° 50' to 22° 47' and east longitude 93° 47' to 95° 55'. It is bordered by [[Sagaing Region]] to the north, [[Mandalay Region]] to the east, [[Bago Region]] to the south, and [[Rakhine State]] and [[Chin State]] to the west.

==History==
[[Fossils]] of the early [[primate]]s over 40 million years old were excavated in the Pondaung and Ponnya areas from Pakokku District in Magway Region, leading the government to proclaim that Myanmar as "the birthplace of humanity in the world," a claim which is unsupported by anthropologists. An ancient city of the [[Pyu]], Peikthano-myo, about 2,000 years old, is located in Taungdwingyi Township, Magway Region.

The history of Magway Region mirrors that of the other divisions of central Burma. The ancient name of Magway Region is Minbu Region (or) Minbu Province. Minbu Region was established with 3 districts. They are Minbu District, Thayet District, and Yenangyaung District.Its capital city was [[Yenangyaung]].In 1950,[[Chauk township]] was moved to Yenangyaung District from Myingyan District.

On 2 March 1962, the military led by General Ne Win took control of Burma through a coup d'état, and the government has been under direct or indirect control by the military. A new constitution of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma was adopted in 1974.

The name of '''Minbu Region''' was changed to '''Magway Region''' and Yenangyaung District was abolished. [[Magway District]] was established with 6 townships. '''Pakokku Hill Tracts''' (or) '''Pakokku Province''' was abolished, and [[Pakokku District]] was added to the Magway Division and [[Mindat District]] was added to the [[Chin state]]. Magway Region was then divided into 4 districts: [[Magway District]], [[Minbu District]], [[Thayet District]] and [[Pakokku District]]. Its capital city was changed from [[Yenangyaung]] to [[Magway, Burma|Magway]].

In 4 April 1996, [[Pakokku District]] was divided into two districts: [[Pakokku District]] and [[Gangaw District]]. Currently, Magway Region has a total of 5 districts and 25 townships.

==Administrative divisions==
Magway Region's districts are [[Magway District|Magwe]], [[Minbu District|Minbu]], [[Thayet District|Thayet]], [[Pakokku District|Pakokku]] and [[Gangaw District|Gangaw]], comprising 25 townships and 1,696 ward village tracts. Its capital city is [[Magwe, Myanmar|Magwe]] (2020 urban population estimated as 85,214) and its largest city is [[Pakokku]] (2020 urban population estimated as 107,890).

Other major cities are [[Aunglan]] (2020 urban population estimated as 52,431), [[Yenangyaung]] (2020 urban population estimated as 49,938), [[Taungdwingyi]] (2020 urban population estimated as 47,739),  [[Chauk]] (2020 urban population estimated as 47,568) and [[Minbu]] (2020 urban population estimated as 40,304).

==Transport==
The [[Irrawaddy River]] is the major transportation system in Magway Region, both in terms of volume of goods and population served. Most major towns in the region are river ports on the Irrawaddy; among them are [[Magway, Burma|Magway]], [[Pakokku]], [[Minbu]], [[Yenangyaung]], [[Chauk]], [[Allanmyo]], and [[Thayetmyo]]. [[Pakokku]]'s river port is a major port of Magway Region and the third most important river port in Myanmar after [[Yangon]] port and [[Mandalay]] port.

[[File:IRRAWADDY FERRY JOURNEY RAILWAY BRIDGE NEAR BAGAN STEAMING TO MANDALAY MYANMA FEB2013.jpg|thumb]]
The major form of transport for non-Irrawaddy areas is by road. The road system is less developed on the western side of the river. The towns are connected with two-lane roads. Most towns have regular bus transportation to [[Rangoon|Rangoon (Yangon)]] and [[Mandalay]].[[Pakokku Bridge]] is part of the [[India–Myanmar–Thailand Trilateral Highway]] and is the longest bridge in Myanmar.

[[File:Myanmar Railways station map Division 10 Pakokku.png|thumb|[[Myanmar Railways]] station map <br />Division 10 Pakokku]]
The [[Pyay]] to [[Nyaung-U]], [[Pakokku]] and [[Myingyan]] railway runs through eastern Magway with connections to the capital [[Naypyidaw]], [[Rangoon]] and [[Mandalay]]. The major stops in Magway on that line are [[Taungdwingyi]] and [[Natmauk]]. In addition, there are two rail lines running north from the Irrawaddy port of [[Kyangin]], one to [[Chaung-U]] in [[Sagaing Region]] and the other to the [[Myittha River|Myittha River valley]] past [[Myaing]] and [[Kyaw]].<ref name="Magwe-Map">[http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-map/magway-map.htm "Map of Magway Division"] Myanmar's Net</ref>

The capital Magway has a small non-commercial airport with air traffic for the city of Magway mostly coming in through Bagan Airport at [[Nyaung U]] some 113&nbsp;km to the north along the Irrawaddy. There are commercial airports at [[Gangaw]], [[Kyauktu]],<ref>[http://www.maplandia.com/burma/airports/kyauktu-airport/ "Burma Airports: Kyauktu Airport Map"] Maplandia</ref> [[Pakokku]], and [[Pauk, Myanmar|Pauk]].<ref name="Magwe-Map" /> {{As of|2018}}, however, none of them have regularly scheduled flights. [[Pakokku]] airport, however, plans to upgrade to an international airport soon.

==Economy==
[[File:Yenangyaung oil wells.jpg|thumb|left|Oil wells in Yenangyaung during the early 20th century.]]
The principal product of Magway Region is [[petroleum]]. It produces most of the oil and [[natural gas]] in Burma. Magway Region's oil fields are located in Mann, Yenangyaung, Chauk, Kyauk-khwet, Letpando and Ayadaw.<ref>[[Myanmar Ministry of Information]] (2002) ''Myanmar, facts and figures 2002'' Union of Myanmar Ministry of Information, Yangon, page 42 {{OCLC|50131671}}</ref>

In May 2002, [[Russia]] agreed to help Myanmar build a 10-megawatt [[nuclear reactor]] and two laboratories in the region.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=7330|title=Burma's Nuclear Ambition|publisher=Irrawaddy May 30, 2007|access-date=2007-06-03}}</ref> Other industries include [[cement]], [[cotton]] [[weaving]], and [[tobacco]], [[iron]] and [[bronze]]. Magway Region produces a large quantity of [[edible oil]] as well as petroleum, hence gaining its reputation as the "oil pot of Myanmar".

Pakokku is the largest rice market city of [[Upper Myanmar]] (Burma). Agriculture is another important practice, the major crops being [[sesamum]] and [[peanut|groundnut]]. Other crops grown are [[rice]], [[millet]], [[maize]], [[sunflower]], [[beans]] and [[pulses]], [[tobacco]], [[palm wine|toddy]], [[chile pepper|chili]], [[onions]], and [[potatoes]]. Famous products of Magway Region include [[Thanaka]] (Limonia acidissima) and [[Phangar]] (Chebulic [[Black Myrobalan|myrobalan]]) fruit.

Only Pakokku and Yenangyaung have industrial zones.

==The Largest Rice Market of Upper Myanmar==
Pakokku is the biggest rice market in Upper Myanmar due to the rice requirement of the region itself and being a door to Chin State which also needs rice. Of the incoming rice to Pakokku, 70% is from the Ayeyawady Region (Myaungmya, Hinthada and Myanaung) and 30% is from Shwebo and Ye-U of the Sagaing Region. Some 20% of rice coming into the market of Pakokku is consumed by Pakokku itself, and the remaining 80% is sent to other township markets. Most buyers are from Myaing, Yesagyo, Pauk, Myingyan, Kalaymyo and Chin State. In the Pakokku market, consumption is 15% for top class, 50% for middle class and 35% for lower class rice. There are about 5 large rice wholesalers and 10 small rice wholesalers. A large rice wholesaler sells 500 to 1,500 bags per day, so it can sell 180,000 to 200,000 bags (9,000-10,000 tons) a year. Due to the smooth transportation and the booming market, the rice price becomes very high. Thus, the rice market in Pakokku has increased to double that of the Mandalay market.

==Health care==
The general state of health care in Myanmar is poor. The military government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country's GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=108&subsecID=900003&contentID=254167 |title=PPI: Almost Half of All World Health Spending is in the United States |date=2007-01-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205231908/http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=108&subsecID=900003&contentID=254167 |archive-date=2008-02-05 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/06/28_Burma.shtml 06.28.2007 | title=Burma junta faulted for rampant diseases | date=2007-06-28 | author=Yasmin Anwar | publisher=UC Berkeley News}}</ref> Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment. Moreover, the health care infrastructure outside of [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]] is extremely poor. As of 2003, Magway Region had less than a quarter of hospital beds than Yangon Region with a slightly greater population.<ref name=cso-hosp>{{cite web|url=http://www.etrademyanmar.com/STATS/s0413.htm |title=Hospitals and Dispensaries by State and Division |access-date=2009-04-11 |publisher=Myanmar Central Statistical Organization |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430032618/http://www.etrademyanmar.com/STATS/s0413.htm |archive-date=2011-04-30 }}</ref>
