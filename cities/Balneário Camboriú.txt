'''Balneário Camboriú''' ({{IPA|pt|bawneˈaɾju kɐ̃boɾiˈu}}) is a coastal city in the southern [[Brazil]]ian state of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]. The city is built on steep hills which drop down to the sea. It is a popular tourist destination for South Americans, who are drawn to its main ocean boulevard Avenida Atlântica (Atlantic Avenue), and who swell the city's population from 145,796 (2020 census office estimate) to over one million in the summer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.clickcamboriu.com.br/turismo/2020/01/reveillon-2020-queima-de-fogos-em-bc-foi-assistida-por-cerca-de-1-milhao-de-pessoas-224333.html|title=Reveillon 2020: fireworks display in BC was attended by about 1 million people|website=clickcamboriu.com.br|date=January 2020 |access-date=2021-01-12}}</ref> Balneário Camboriú is famous for its unique beach-to-beach [[gondola lift|cable car]] which links the city's central beach with the beach of Laranjeiras. The city is located {{cvt|10|km}} south of the city of [[Itajaí]], {{cvt|96|km}} south of the city of [[Joinville]], and {{cvt|80|km}} north of the state capital, [[Florianópolis]].

The city is served by [[Ministro Victor Konder International Airport]] located in the adjoining municipality of [[Navegantes]].

The original meaning of the city's name is unknown. According to the city's archives, it is "River filled with Snook (Robalo)", which is a very common type of fish in this region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balneariocamboriu.sc.gov.br/arquivo/?toda=1|title=Prefeitura Municipal de Balneário Camboriú - Arquivo Histórico<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=sc.gov.br|access-date=2015-07-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716024354/http://www.balneariocamboriu.sc.gov.br/arquivo/?toda=1|archive-date=2015-07-16|url-status = dead}}</ref> Ilha das Cabras (Goats' Island) is directly opposite the city and is too small for habitation but it is lit at night. Visitors to nearby Laranjeiras Beach can sail there aboard 17th century-style pirate ships, going around Ilha das Cabras before returning to Balneário Camboriú.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barcopirata.com.br/index2.html |title=BARCO PIRATA - Passeos de Barco |access-date=2015-07-15 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127064224/http://www.barcopirata.com.br/index2.html |archive-date=2015-01-27 }}</ref>  The city also has a statue similar to [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s ''Cristo Redentor'' ([[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|''Christ the Redeemer'']]). Standing atop the Morro da Cruz, ''[[Cristo Luz]]'' (Christ Light) portrays Jesus holding a circular "broad-brimmed hat" at his left shoulder, symbolizing the [[sun]], and which houses a spotlight that shines out over the city.  The Cristo Luz at 33 meters tall is only five meters shorter than the ''Redeemer'' and colorful lights both within and without the statue give it nighttime illumination.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cristoluz.com.br/cristo-luz/|title=Complexo Cristo Luz - Cristo Luz - Balneário Camboriú - Santa Catarina|first=Jardel|last=Bazi|website=Cristo Luz|accessdate=20 April 2023}}</ref>  Another common sight in the city are paragliders over the beach, alongside the tall buildings, from the gliderport in Praia dos Amores.  To the west the city is bordered by the Camboriú River, which joins the ocean at the southern edge of the center of the city, where the cable car (teleférico) rises from the central beach.

The city has been called the "Brazilian [[Dubai]]", due to its high number of skyscrapers and affluent tourists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.correiodopovo.com.br/Impresso/?Ano=117&Numero=89&Caderno=14&Noticia=375449|title=Correio do Povo - O portal de notícias dos gaúchos - Versão Impressa|website=www.correiodopovo.com.br|access-date=2013-12-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223111012/http://www.correiodopovo.com.br/Impresso/?Ano=117&Numero=89&Caderno=14&Noticia=375449|archive-date=2018-02-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
The indigenous [[Tupi-Guaraní]] tribe first inhabited the region. Europeans settled in the area in 1758 when a few families from Porto Belo moved to a site they called Our Lady of Bon Sucesso and is now known as Barra. Francisco Garcia and his family and their slaves lived nearby, from which the village became known as Garcia. Baltasar Pinto Corrêa came from the [[Azores]] and was also an early settler. These were followed by groups of Germans who came from the valleys of the Itajal and Blumenauin, in search of fertile land. They built the church of Our Lady of Good Success and they founded the town of Bom Sucesso. In 1848 it became a district of the city of Itajaí, until it was detached in  1884. In 1930, the privileged geographical location began to be preferred by vacationing oceangoers, and two years later the town's first hotel was built at the confluence of Central and Atlantic Avenues. In 1964, the district earned autonomy under the toponym Balneário de Camboriú, which was amended in 1979 to Balneário Camboriú.

There are two version of the origin of the toponym ''Camboriú''. One claims that the residents used the expression "camba the river" due to a sharp bend in the river near its mouth (''cambar'' is a Portuguese verb that can mean ''to sharply change direction''). Another idea was proposed by the local priest Raulin Reitz, who said that the maps of old indicated the name Rio Camboriú before Europeans had settled in the area, and that the toponym Camboriú comes from the [[Tupi language]], formed by the agglutination of ''Camboriú'' and ''-u''.

==Economy==
{{More citations needed section|date=November 2023}}
The main economic activity of the city is related to its residential real estate market, dominated by local developers, with prices reaching US$10,000/sqm for beachfront high rises, although the average price falls to around US$3,000/sqm. Loose urban laws allowed the creation of some of the tallest buildings in the southern hemisphere, surpassing 280m of height in some cases. The fluctuation of its population, which rises almost fivefold during the summer season, commonly overloads municipal service networks, degrading water quality for beachgoers and causing shortages in the fresh water supply. Recent investments have been made to tackle this issue, but the city’s high density and population fluctuation makes it a challenging task. The access to Balneario Camboriú is restricted to its main state road, BR-101, and the affluence of tourists causes large traffic jams in all directions for the most part of the year. The nearest airport is located in [[Navegantes Airport|Navegantes]], 16 km (9.9 mi) distant. A cruise terminal has been planned, due to be completed in 2025-26, in order to further supplement the availability of the city to tourists. Near the future terminal, in the southern end of the city, there is a cable car at the Tourist Complex UNIPRAIAS that connects the central beach to the nearby Laranjeiras beach.  There are many other beaches in the southern section of Balneário Camboriú, such as Bamboos, Estaleiro, Estaleirinho, and Pinho beach (the first officially designated [[nudist beach]] in Brazil). These beaches are linked by Interpraias road, up to the limits of the municipality of Itapema. Other prevalent forms of economic activity within the city are in trade and the services industries. There are around 100 hotels, 350 large commercial buildings, and 1,035 high-density upper- and middle-class residential buildings.

Regarding tourists, 45% of intranational or domestic tourists come from the [[State of São Paulo]]; many of the rest come from nearby states, such as Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul, in addition to Santa Catarina itself. Regarding international visitors, 30% come from [[Argentina]], and the rest, roughly speaking, from neighboring countries such as Uruguay, Paraguay and Chile.<ref>[https://ndmais.com.br/turismo/saiba-de-onde-sao-os-turistas-que-visitam-balneario-camboriu-no-verao/ Saiba de onde são os turistas que visitam Balneário Camboriú no verão]</ref><ref>[https://www.bc.sc.gov.br/imprensa_detalhe.cfm?codigo=35789 Número de turistas aumentou em Balneário Camboriú em 2023]</ref>
