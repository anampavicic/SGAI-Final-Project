[[Helsinki Airport]], in the neighbouring city of Vantaa, serves the city with frequent flights to numerous destinations in Europe, North America, and Asia.

Helsinki is a [[bilingual]] municipality with [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] as its official languages. The population consists of {{Formatnum: {{pct|{{Data Finland municipality/native language Finnish|Helsinki}}|{{Data Finland municipality/native language total|Helsinki}}|0}}}} Finnish speakers, {{Formatnum: {{pct|{{Data Finland municipality/native language Swedish|Helsinki}}|{{Data Finland municipality/native language total|Helsinki}}|0}}}} Swedish speakers, and {{Formatnum: {{pct|{{Data Finland municipality/native language other|Helsinki}}|{{Data Finland municipality/native language total|Helsinki}}|0}}}} speakers of other languages (which is well above the national average).

==Etymology==
According to a theory put forward in the 1630s, at the time of [[Swedish colonisation of Finland|Swedish colonisation]] of the Finnish coast, colonists from [[Hälsingland]] in central [[Sweden]] arrived at what is now the [[Vantaa (river)|Vantaa River]] and called it {{Lang|sv|Helsingå}} ('Helsinge River'), giving rise to the names of the [[Helsingin pitäjän kirkonkylä|village]] and [[Church of St. Lawrence, Vantaa|church]] of Helsinge in the 1300s.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Salminen |first=Tapio |title=Vantaan ja Helsingin pitäjän keskiaika |date=2013 |isbn=978-952-443-455-3 |location=Vantaa |publisher=Vantaan kaupunki |language=fi |trans-title=The Middle-age in Vantaa and Helsinki}}</ref> This theory is questionable, as dialect research suggests that the settlers came from [[Uppland]] and the surrounding areas.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hellman |first=Sonja |date=7 June 2015 |title=Historiska fel upprättas i ny bok |language=sv |trans-title=Historical misinformation corrected in new book |work=Hufvudstadsbladet}}</ref> Others have suggested that the name derives from the Swedish word {{Lang|sv|helsing}}, an archaic form of the word {{Lang|sv|hals}} ('[[neck]]'), which refers to the narrowest part of a river, the [[rapids]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Utbildning & Vetenskap: Svenskfinland |url=http://veta.yle.fi/svenskfinland/artikel.php?id=23&subject=mellannyland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512081641/http://veta.yle.fi/svenskfinland/artikel.php?id=23&subject=mellannyland |archive-date=12 May 2008 |access-date=8 July 2009 |publisher=Veta.yle.fi}}</ref> Other Scandinavian towns in similar geographical locations were given similar names at the time, such as [[Helsingør]] in Denmark and [[Helsingborg]] in Sweden.

When a town was founded in the village of [[Koskela|Forsby]] (later {{Lang|fi|Koskela}}) in 1548, it was called {{Lang|fi|Helsinge fors}}, 'Helsinge rapids'. The name refers to the {{ill|Vanhankaupunginkoski|fi|Vanhankaupunginkoski}} rapids at the mouth of the river.<ref>{{cite web |last=<!--Not stated--> |title=Onko kosken alkuperäinen nimi Helsinginkoski vai Vanhankaupunginkoski? |url=http://www.helsinginkoski.fi/kysymyksetjavastaukset/onko-kosken-alkuperainen-nimi-helsinginkoski-vai-vanhankaupunginkoski/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305220022/http://www.helsinginkoski.fi/kysymyksetjavastaukset/onko-kosken-alkuperainen-nimi-helsinginkoski-vai-vanhankaupunginkoski/ |archive-date=5 March 2016 |access-date=26 February 2016 |website=Helsinginkoski}}</ref> The town was commonly known as {{Lang|fi|Helsinge}} or {{Lang|fi|Helsing}}, from which the modern Finnish name is derived.<ref>{{cite web |last=Jäppinen |first=Jere |date=2007 |title=Helsingin nimi |url=http://www.helsinginkaupunginmuseo.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sofia_2_2007.pdf |access-date=26 February 2016 |website=www.helsinginkaupunginmuseo.fi |publisher=Helsingin kaupunginmuseo}}</ref>

Official [[Council of State (Finland)|Finnish government]] documents and Finnish language newspapers have used the name ''Helsinki'' since 1819, when the [[Senate of Finland]] moved to the city from [[Turku]], the former capital of Finland. Decrees issued in Helsinki were dated with Helsinki as the place of issue. This is how the form Helsinki came to be used in [[literary language|written]] Finnish.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Jäppinen |first=Jere |date=15 November 2011 |title=Mistä Helsingin nimi on peräisin? |url=http://www.hs.fi/paivanlehti/arkisto/Mist%C3%A4+Helsingin+nimi+on+per%C3%A4isin/aaHS20111115SI1AT02exp?src=haku&ref=arkisto%2F |journal=Helsingin Sanomat |pages=D2 |access-date=29 November 2013 |archive-date=29 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129184056/http://www.hs.fi/paivanlehti/arkisto/Mist%C3%A4+Helsingin+nimi+on+per%C3%A4isin/aaHS20111115SI1AT02exp?src=haku&ref=arkisto%2F }}</ref> When Finland became a Grand Duchy of Finland, an autonomous state under the rule of the [[Russian Empire]], Helsinki was known as {{Transliteration|ru|Gel'singfors}} ({{Lang|ru|Гельсингфорс}}) in Russian, because the main and official language of Grand Duchy of Finland was Swedish.

In [[Helsinki slang]], the city is called {{Lang|fi|Stadi}} (from the Swedish word {{Lang|sv|stad}}, meaning 'city'). Abbreviated form {{Lang|fi|Hesa}} is equally common, but its use is associated with people of rural origin ("junantuomat", lit. "brought by a train") and frowned upon by locals.<ref name="nickname" /><ref>Ristkari, Maiju: ''Heinäsorsat Helsingissä''.

=== Early history ===
After the end of the [[Last Glacial Period|Ice Age]] and the retreat of the ice sheet, the first settlers arrived in the Helsinki area around 5000 BC. Their presence has been documented by archaeologists in [[Vantaa]], [[Pitäjänmäki]] and [[Kaarela]].<ref name="NKent">{{Cite book |first=Neil |last=Kent |title=Helsinki: A cultural and literary history |publisher=Signal Books |year=2004 |location=Oxford}}</ref> Permanent settlements did not appear until the beginning of the 1st millennium AD, during the [[Iron Age]], when the area was inhabited by the [[Tavastians]]. They used the area for fishing and hunting, but due to the lack of archaeological finds it is difficult to say how extensive their settlements were.

[[Christianity]] does not gain a significant foothold in Finland before the 11th century. After that, a number of [[Christian cross|crosses]] and other objects related to Christianity can be found in archaeological material. According to the traditional view, the [[Kingdom of Sweden (800–1521)|Kingdom of Sweden]] made three crusades to Finland, thanks to which the region was incorporated into both Christianity and the Swedish Empire. Recent research has shown that these expeditions, to the extent that there were even three of them, were not the crusades that had been imagined. Later, the conquest of Finland was justified in terms of "civilisation" and "christianisation", and the myth of the Crusades was developed. It is more likely that it was a multidimensional combination of economic, cultural and political power ambitions.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-03-04 |title=Keskiaikainen Helsingin pitäjä {{!}} Historia Helsinki |url=https://historia.hel.fi/fi/kaannekohdat/alkujuuret-ja-perustaminen/keskiaikainen-helsingin-pitaja |access-date=2024-02-21 |website=historia.hel.fi |language=fi}}</ref>

The early settlements were raided by [[Vikings]] until 1008, and the [[Battle at Herdaler]] was a battle between the Norse Viking leader Olav Haraldsson (later King [[Olaf II of Norway]], also known as Saint Olaf) and local Finns at Herdaler (now [[Ingå]]), not far from Helsinga, around 1007–8.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Väätäinen |first=Erika |date=2022-03-04 |title=Were There Ever Vikings In Finland Or Finnish Vikings? |url=https://scandification.com/finnish-vikings-and-vikings-in-finland/ |access-date=2024-02-24 |website=Scandification |language=en-GB}}</ref> The [[Heimskringla|Saga of Olaf Haraldson]] tells how Olav raided the coasts of Finland and was almost killed in battle.

Later the area was settled by Christians from Sweden. They came mainly from the Swedish coastal regions of [[Norrland]] and [[Hälsingland]], and their migration intensified around 1100.<ref name="NKent" />  The [[Swedish colonisation of Finland|Swedes permanently colonised]] the Helsinki region's coastline in the late 13th century, after the successful 'crusade' to Finland that led to the defeat of the Tavastians.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tarkiainen |first=Kari |title=Ruotsin itämaa |publisher=Svenska litteratussällskapet i Finland |year=2010 |location=Helsinki |pages=122–125}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

In the Middle Ages, the Helsinki area was a landscape of small villages. Some of the old villages from the 1240s in the area of present-day Helsinki, such as [[Koskela]] and [[Töölö]], are now Helsinki districts, as are the rest of the 27 medieval villages. The area gradually became part of the Kingdom of Sweden and Christianity. [[King's Road (Finland)|Kuninkaantie]], or the "King's Road", ran through the area and two interesting medieval buildings were built here: {{ill|Vartiokylä hillfort|fi|Vartiokylän linnavuori}} in the 1380s and the [[Church of St. Lawrence, Vantaa|Church of St. Lawrence]] in 1455. In the Middle Ages, several thousand people lived in Helsinki's [[keep]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-03-04 |title=Keskiaikainen Helsingin pitäjä {{!}} Historia Helsinki |url=https://historia.hel.fi/fi/kaannekohdat/alkujuuret-ja-perustaminen/keskiaikainen-helsingin-pitaja |access-date=2024-02-13 |website=historia.hel.fi |language=fi}}</ref>

There was a lot of trade across the [[Baltic Sea]]. The shipping route to the coast, and especially to [[Reval]], meant that by the end of the Middle Ages the Helsinki region had become an important trading centre for wealthy [[peasant]]s, [[priest]]s and [[nobility|noble]]s in Finland, after [[Vyborg]] and [[Pohja]]. [[Fur]]s, [[wood]], [[tar]], [[fish]] and animals were exported from Helsinki, and [[salt]] and [[grain]] were brought to the fortress. Helsinki was also the most important cattle-breeding area in Uusimaa. With the help of trade, Helsinki became one of the wealthiest cities in Finland and Uusimaa. Thanks to trade and travel, e.g. to Reval, people could speak several languages, at least helpfully. Depending on the situation, Finnish, Swedish, Latin or Low German could be heard in the Helsinki area.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-11-16 |title=Keskiaikaista arkea Helsingin pitäjässä {{!}} Historia Helsinki |url=https://historia.hel.fi/fi/ilmiot/arjen-muuttuvat-kasvot/keskiaikaista-arkea-helsingin-pitajassa |access-date=2024-02-15 |website=historia.hel.fi |language=fi}}</ref>

Written chronicles from 1417 mention the village of [[Koskela]] near the rapids at the mouth of the [[Vantaa River|River Vantaa]], where Helsinki was to be founded.<ref name="NKent" />

=== Founding of Helsinki ===
[[File:Helsinki Map 1645.png|thumb|left|upright|A map of Helsinki in 1645]]
Helsinki was founded by King [[Gustav I of Sweden]] on 12 June 1550 as a trading town called Helsingfors to rival the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] city of Reval (now [[Tallinn]]) on the southern shore of the [[Gulf of Finland]].<ref name="Tabblo100">{{cite web |title=Ruttopuisto&nbsp;– Plague Park |url=http://www.tabblo.com/studio/stories/view/409531/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411112934/http://www.tabblo.com/studio/stories/view/409531/ |archive-date=11 April 2008 |access-date=3 November 2008 |publisher=Tabblo.com}}</ref><ref name="NKent" /> To populate the new town at the mouth of the [[Vantaa River]], the king ordered the [[bourgeoisie]] of [[Porvoo]], [[Raseborg]], [[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]] and [[Ulvila]] to [[Forced displacement|move]] there.<ref name="helsinki-history">{{cite web |title=Helsingin historia |url=http://www.hel.fi/www/Helsinki/fi/kaupunki-ja-hallinto/tietoa-helsingista/helsingin-historia-ja-arkistot/ |website=Helsingin kaupunki |language=fi}}</ref> The shallowness of the bay made it impossible to build a harbour, and the king allowed the settlers to leave the unfortunate location. In 1640, Count [[Per Brahe the Younger]], together with some descendants of the original settlers, moved the centre of the city to the [[Vironniemi]] peninsula by the sea, today's [[Kruununhaka]] district, where the [[Senate Square, Helsinki|Senate Square]] and [[Helsinki Cathedral]] are located.<ref name="matkaoppaat"/>

During the second half of the 17th century, Helsinki, as a wooden city, suffered from regular [[fire]]s, and by the beginning of the 18th century the population had fallen below 1,700. For a long time Helsinki was mainly a small administrative town for the governors of [[Nyland and Tavastehus County]], but its importance began to grow in the 18th century when plans were made to build a more solid naval defence in front of the city.<ref name="helsinki-history"/> Little came of these plans, however, as Helsinki remained a small town plagued by poverty, war and disease. The [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|plague]] of 1710 killed most of Helsinki's population.<ref name="Tabblo100" /> After the [[Battle of Helsinki (1713)|Russians captured]] Helsinki in May 1713 during the [[Great Northern War]], the retreating Swedish administration set fire to parts of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://historia.hel.fi/fi/kaannekohdat/tuho-ja-jalleenrakennus/suuri-pohjan-sota-ja-helsingin-tuho|title=Suuri Pohjan sota ja Helsingin tuho|date=21 January 2022 |publisher=City of Helsinki|access-date=10 May 2023|language=fi}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Seppo|last=Aalto|title=Kruununkaupunki – Vironniemen Helsinki 1640–1721|publisher=[[Finnish Literature Society]]|location=Helsinki|year=2015|isbn=978-952-222-675-4|language=fi}}</ref> Despite this, the city's population grew to 3,000 by the beginning of the 19th century. The construction of the naval fortress of [[Suomenlinna|Sveaborg]] (''Viapori'' in Finnish, now also called ''Suomenlinna'') in the 18th century helped to improve Helsinki's status. However, it wasn't until Russia defeated Sweden in the [[Finnish War]] and annexed Finland as the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] in 1809 that the city began to develop into a substantial city. The Russians besieged the Sveaborg fortress during the war, and about a quarter of the city was destroyed in a fire in 1808.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Niukkanen |first1=Marianna |last2=Heikkinen, Markku |title=Vuoden 1808 suurpalo |url=http://www.nba.fi/helsinginarkeologiaa/keskusta_kohteet_1810.htm |access-date=14 July 2013 |website=Kurkistuksia Helsingin kujille |publisher=National Board of Antiquities |language=fi |archive-date=14 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214210101/http://www.nba.fi/helsinginarkeologiaa/keskusta_kohteet_1810.htm }}</ref>

Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]] moved the capital of Finland from [[Turku]] to Helsinki on 8 April 1812 to reduce Swedish influence in Finland and bring the capital closer to [[St Petersburg]].<ref>{{cite web |title=8 April 1812 Emperor Alexander I promotes Helsinki to the capital of the Grand Duchy. - Helsinki 200 years as capital |url=http://www.helsinki200.fi/en/helsinki-1812-2012/1812-emperor-alexander-i-promotes-helsinki-capital-grand-duchy/ |access-date=21 January 2016 |archive-date=10 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810032003/http://www.helsinki200.fi/en/helsinki-1812-2012/1812-emperor-alexander-i-promotes-helsinki-capital-grand-duchy/ }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://yle.fi/news/3-5486170|title=Bicentennial of Helsinki as Finnish capital|work=[[Yle News]]|date=8 April 2012|access-date=8 April 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/1978-lobbying-for-helsinki-200-years-ago-2.html|title=Lobbying for Helsinki 200 years ago|work=[[Helsinki Times]]|date=19 April 2012|access-date=8 April 2022}}</ref> After the [[Great Fire of Turku]] in 1827, the [[Royal Academy of Turku]], the only university in the country at the time, was also moved to Helsinki and eventually became the modern University of Helsinki. The move consolidated the city's new role and helped set it on a path of continuous growth. This transformation is most evident in the city centre, which was rebuilt in the [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] style to resemble St. Petersburg, largely according to a plan by the German-born architect [[Carl Ludvig Engel|C. L. Engel]]. As elsewhere, technological advances such as the railway and [[industrialisation]] were key factors in the city's growth.

===Twentieth century===

By the 1910s, Helsinki's population was already over 100,000, and despite the turbulence of Finnish history in the first half of the 20th century, Helsinki continued to grow steadily. This included the [[Finnish Civil War]] and the [[Winter War]], both of which left their mark on the city. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were roughly equal numbers of Finnish and [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedish speakers]] in Helsinki; the majority of workers were Finnish-speaking. The local [[Helsinki slang]] (or ''stadin slangi'') developed among Finnish children and young people from the 1890s as a mixed Finnish-Swedish language, with influences from [[German language|German]] and [[Russian language|Russian]], and from the 1950s the slang began to become more Finnish.<ref>{{cite book| author=Marjo Vilkko | title=Suomi on ruotsalainen | chapter=Stadin slangi | pages=216–219 | location=Helsinki | publisher=[[Schildts & Söderströms]] | year=2014 | isbn=978-951-52-3419-3 | language = fi}}</ref> A landmark event was the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Olympic Games]], which were held in Helsinki. Finland's rapid urbanisation in the 1970s, which occurred late compared to the rest of Europe, tripled the population of the metropolitan area, and the [[Helsinki Metro]] subway system was built.

The city centre is located on a southern peninsula, ''Helsinginniemi'' ("Cape of Helsinki"), which is rarely referred to by its actual name, [[Vironniemi]] ("Cape of Estonia"). Population density is comparatively high in certain parts of downtown Helsinki, reaching {{convert|16494|PD/km2}} in the district of [[Kallio]],  overall Helsinki's population density is 3,147 per square kilometre. Outside the city centre, much of Helsinki consists of post-war suburbs separated by patches of forest. A narrow, {{convert|10|km}} long [[Central Park (Helsinki)|Helsinki Central Park]], which stretches from the city centre to Helsinki's northern border, is an important recreational area for residents. The City of Helsinki has about 11,000 boat [[Berth (moorings)|moorings]] and over {{convert|14,000|ha|acre mi2|abbr=off}} of marine fishing waters adjacent to the capital region. About 60 species of fish are found in this area, and recreational fishing is popular.

Helsinki's main islands include [[Seurasaari]], [[Lauttasaari]] and [[Korkeasaari]] – the latter is home to Finland's largest zoo, [[Korkeasaari Zoo]]. The former military islands of [[Vallisaari]] and [[Isosaari]] are now open to the public, but [[Santahamina]] is still in military use. The most historic and remarkable island is the fortress of [[Suomenlinna]] (Sveaborg).<ref name="36h"/> The island of [[Pihlajasaari]] is a popular summer resort, comparable to [[Fire Island]] in [[New York City]].

There are 60 [[nature reserve]]s in Helsinki with a total area of {{convert|95480|acre|ha}}. Of the total area, {{convert|48190|acre|ha}} are water areas and {{convert|47290|acre|ha}} are land areas. The city also has seven nature reserves in [[Espoo]], [[Sipoo]], [[Hanko, Finland|Hanko]] and [[Ingå]]. The largest nature reserve is the [[Vanhankaupunginselkä]], with an area of {{convert|30600|acre|ha}}. The city's first nature reserve, Tiiraluoto of Lauttasaari, was established in 1948.<ref>{{cite magazine| last= Kotka |first=Tiina | title= Stadilla on 60 luonnonsuojelualuetta | magazine= Helsinki-lehti | date= 14 May 2020 | number= 2/2020 | page= 27 | publisher= City of Helsinki | url= https://www.hel.fi/static/liitteet/kanslia/helsinki-info/arkisto/2020/HKI0220_nettilehti_1505.pdf | language= fi | access-date= 30 December 2020}}</ref>

The Capital Region spreads over a land area of {{convert|770|km2}} and has a population density of 1,619 per sg km. With over 20 percent of the country's population in just 0.2 percent of its surface area, the area's housing density is high by Finnish standards.

The [[Helsinki metropolitan area]] or the Greater Helsinki consists of the cities of the capital region and ten surrounding municipalities: [[Hyvinkää]], [[Järvenpää]], [[Kerava]], [[Kirkkonummi]], [[Nurmijärvi]], [[Sipoo]], [[Tuusula]], [[Pornainen]], [[Mäntsälä]] and [[Vihti]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.kielitoimistonohjepankki.fi/ohje/403 | title= Pääkaupunkiseutu, Suur-Helsinki ja Helsingin seutu | work= Kotus | access-date= 30 December 2020 | language= fi}}</ref> The Metropolitan Area covers {{convert|3697|km2|0|abbr=out}} and has a population of about {{formatnum: {{#expr: ({{Data Finland municipality/population count|Helsinki}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Espoo}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Vantaa}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Mäntsälä}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Pornainen}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Kauniainen}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Kirkkonummi}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Vihti}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Nurmijärvi}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Hyvinkää}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Tuusula}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Kerava}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Järvenpää}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Sipoo}}) /1000000 round 2 }} }} million, or about a fourth of the total population of Finland.

The Helsinki metropolitan area is the world's northernmost urban area with a population of over one million people, and the northernmost EU capital city.

The [[Helsinki urban area]] is an officially recognized [[Urban areas in Finland|urban area in Finland]], defined by its population density. The area stretches throughout 11 municipalities, and is the largest such area in Finland, with a land area of {{convert|669.31|km2}} and approximately 1.36 &nbsp;million inhabitants.

===Climate===
Helsinki has a cold [[hemiboreal]] [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfb'', [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]] ''Dcbo'').<ref>{{cite web |title=Climate Helsinki: Temperature, Climograph, Climate table for Helsinki - Climate-Data.org |url=https://en.climate-data.org/location/5971/ |access-date=17 January 2018 |website=en.climate-data.org}}</ref> Due to the moderating influence of the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[North Atlantic Current]] (see also [[Extratropical cyclone]]), winter temperatures are higher than the northern location would suggest, with an average of {{convert|-4|C|F}} in January and February.<ref name="fmiclimate">{{cite web |title=Climatological statistics for the normal period 1971–2000 |url=http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/normal-period-1981-2010 |access-date=13 April 2010 |publisher=Fmi.fi}}</ref>

Winters in Helsinki are significantly warmer than in the north of Finland, and the snow season in the capital is much shorter due to its location in the extreme south of Finland and the [[urban heat island]] effect. Temperatures below {{convert|-20|C|F}} occur only a few times a year. However, due to the latitude, the days around the [[winter solstice]] are 5 hours and 48 minutes long, with the sun very low (at noon the sun is just over 6 degrees in the sky), and the cloudy weather at this time of year exacerbates the darkness. Conversely, Helsinki enjoys long days in summer, with 18 hours and 57 minutes of daylight around the [[summer solstice]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Tukiainen |first=Matti |title=Helsinki, Finland&nbsp;– Sunrise, sunset, dawn and dusk times around the World! |url=http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/helsinki.html |access-date=11 February 2011 |website=Gaisma}}</ref>

The average maximum temperature from June to August is around {{convert|19|to|22|C|F}}. Due to the sea effect, especially on hot summer days, daytime temperatures are slightly cooler and nighttime temperatures higher than further inland.

===Neighbourhoods and other subdivisions===
{{Main|Subdivisions of Helsinki}}
Helsinki is divided into three major areas: [[Helsinki City Centre|Helsinki Downtown]] ({{langx|fi|Helsingin kantakaupunki}}, {{langx|sv|Helsingfors innerstad}}), [[North Helsinki]] ({{langx|fi|Pohjois-Helsinki}}, {{langx|sv|Norra Helsingfors}}) and [[East Helsinki]] ({{langx|fi|Itä-Helsinki}}, {{langx|sv|Östra Helsingfors}}). Of these, Helsinki Downtown means the undefined core area of capital, as opposed to [[suburb]]s. The designations [[Central business district|business center]] and city center usually refer to [[Kluuvi]], [[Kamppi]] and [[Punavuori]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.hel.fi/www/Helsinki/fi/kaupunki-ja-hallinto/hallinto/kaupunginosat/kamppi-kluuvi-punavuori | title=Kamppi, Kluuvi ja Punavuori | work = City of Helsinki | access-date=30 December 2020 | language= fi}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.pienimatkaopas.com/helsinki/majoittuminen.html | title= Millainen hotelli Helsingissä kannattaa valita ja miltä alueelta | work= Pieni matkaopas | access-date=30 December 2020 | language= fi}}</ref> Other subdivisional centers outside the downtown area include [[Malmi, Helsinki|Malmi]] ({{langx|sv|Malm}}),<ref>[https://www.uuttahelsinkia.fi/fi/malmi Malmi], Uuttahelsinkiä.fi, (in Finnish)</ref><ref>[https://www.sttinfo.fi/tiedote/malmin-keskustan-suunnitteluperiaatteet-paatoksentekoon?publisherId=60577852&releaseId=69910578 Malmin keskustan suunnitteluperiaatteet päätöksentekoon – STT Info] (in Finnish)</ref> located in the northeastern part of city, and [[Itäkeskus]] ({{langx|sv|Östra centrum}}),<ref>[https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-11632410 Tässä on tuleva Itä-Helsingin keskus: Itäväylän päälle rakentuu taloja ja tilaa kaikille, Stoan Puhoksen ja Puotilan metroaseman alueen monikulttuurisuutta halutaan rikastaa] – ''[[Yle]]'' (in Finnish)</ref> in the eastern part of city.

===Neoclassical and romantic nationalism trend===
[[File:West side of Helsinki Cathedral in Kruununhaka, Helsinki, Finland, 2022 April.jpg|thumb|right|[[Helsinki Cathedral]] is among the most prominent buildings in the city]]
[[File:Hotel Kämp by Night in Winter - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Hotel Kämp]], the most luxurious hotel in Helsinki, located in [[Kluuvi]]]]
[[Carl Ludvig Engel]], appointed to plan a new city centre on his own, designed several [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] buildings in Helsinki. The focal point of Engel's city plan was the [[Helsinki Senate Square|Senate Square]]. It is surrounded by the [[Government Palace (Finland)|Government Palace]] (to the east), the main building of Helsinki University (to the west), and (to the north) the large [[Helsinki Cathedral]], which was finished in 1852, twelve years after Engel's death. Helsinki's [[epithet]], "The White City of the North", derives from this construction era. Most of Helsinki's older buildings were built after the 1808 fire; before that time, the oldest surviving building in the center of Helsinki is the {{ill|Sederholm House|fr|Maison Sederholm}} (1757) at the intersection of Senate Square and the Katariinankatu street.<ref name="matkaoppaat">{{cite web| url=http://matkaoppaat.com/helsinki/ | title=Helsinki – Suomi | website=Matkaoppaat.com | access-date=29 December 2020 | language=fi}}</ref> Suomenlinna also has buildings completed in the 18th century, including the [[Kuninkaanportti]] on the {{ill|Kustaanmiekka|fr|Kustaanmiekka|lt=Kustaanmiekka Island}} (1753–1754).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.suomenlinna.fi/kavijalle/nahtavyydet/kuninkaanportti/ | title=Kuninkaanportti | work=Suomenlinna | access-date=29 December 2020 | language=fi}}</ref> The oldest church in Helsinki is the Östersundom church, built in 1754.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Vuonna 1754 rakennettu Östersundomin kirkko on Helsingin vanhin kirkko |url=https://www.helsinginseurakunnat.fi/ostersundominhautausmaa/artikkelit/chpmocf43 |access-date=2024-02-12 |website=Helsingin seurakunnat |language=fi}}</ref>

Helsinki is also home to numerous [[Art Nouveau]]-influenced ([[Jugendstil|Jugend]] in Finnish) buildings belonging to the Kansallisromantiikka ([[romantic nationalism]]) trend, designed in the early 20th century and strongly influenced by ''[[Kalevala]]'', which was a common theme of the era. Helsinki's Art Nouveau style is also featured in central residential districts, such as [[Katajanokka]] and [[Ullanlinna]].<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/greathomesanddestinations/25iht-rehelsinki25.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 | title=In Helsinki, Modern Units to Art Nouveau Gems | work = [[The New York Times]] | date=24 January 2013 | access-date =22 October 2021 | last1=Colston | first1=Penelope }}</ref> An important architect of the Finnish Art Nouveau style was [[Eliel Saarinen]], whose architectural masterpiece was the [[Helsinki Central railway station|Helsinki Central Station]]. Opposite the [[Bank of Finland]] building is the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revivalish]] the [[House of the Estates]] (1891).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.virtualhelsinki.net/info/page_object.php?obj_id=60 | title=Säätytalo | work=Virtual Helsinki | access-date=29 December 2020 | language=fi | archive-date=14 September 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914034744/http://www.virtualhelsinki.net/info/page_object.php?obj_id=60 }}</ref>

The only visible public buildings of the [[Gothic Revival architecture]] in Helsinki are [[St. John's Church, Helsinki|St. John's Church]] (1891) in Ullanlinna, which is the largest stone church in Finland, and its twin towers rise to 74 meters and have 2,600 seats.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.helsinginkirkot.fi/fi/kirkot/johanneksenkirkko | title= Johanneksenkirkko | work= Helsingin kirkot | access-date= 29 December 2020 | language= fi | archive-date= 4 August 2017 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170804095812/http://www.helsinginkirkot.fi/fi/kirkot/johanneksenkirkko }}</ref> Other examples of neo-Gothic include the [[House of Nobility (Finland)|House of Nobility]] in [[Kruununhaka]] and the [[Catholic]] [[St. Henry's Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite web | url= https://hkm.finna.fi/Record/hkm.HKMS000005%3A00000tio | title= Ritarihuone | work= Helsingin kaupunginmuseo | access-date= 29 December 2020 | language= fi | archive-date= 19 March 2021 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210319112618/https://hkm.finna.fi/Record/hkm.HKMS000005%3A00000tio }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.discoveringfinland.com/fi/travel/nae-koe/nahtavyydet-kulttuuri/monumentit/katedraalit/ | title= Katedraalit ja tuomiokirkot | work = Discovering finland | access-date=29 December 2020 | language=fi}}</ref>

In addition to other cities in Northern Europe that were not under the [[Soviet Union]], such as [[Stockholm]], Sweden, Helsinki's neoclassical buildings gained also popularity as a backdrop for scenes intended to depict the Soviet Union in numerous Hollywood movies during the [[Cold War]] era, when filming within the actual USSR was not possible. Some of them, including ''[[The Kremlin Letter]]'' (1970), ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'' (1981), and ''[[Gorky Park (film)|Gorky Park]]'' (1983).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Willis |first=David K. |date=4 August 1983 |title=When it comes to films on Russia, they've seen enough |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1983/0804/080464.html |journal=Christian Science Monitor}}</ref> was possible due to such Russian cities as [[Leningrad]] and [[Moscow]] also having similar neoclassical architecture.

When Finland became heavily urbanized in the 1960s and 1970s, the district of [[Pihlajamäki]], for example, was built in Helsinki for new residents, where for the first time in Finland, [[precast concrete]] was used on a large scale. [[Pikku Huopalahti]], built in the 1980s and 1990s, has tried to get rid of a one-size-fits-all grid pattern, which means that its look is very organic and its streets are not repeated in the same way. [[Itäkeskus]] in [[Eastern Helsinki]] was the first regional center in the 1980s.<ref name="ilonen">Ilonen, Arvi: Helsinki, Espoo, Kauniainen, Vantaa – arkkitehtuuriopas.

The city of Helsinki has {{formatnum: {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Helsinki }}}} inhabitants, making it the most populous municipality in Finland and the third in the [[Nordic countries|Nordics]].  The [[Helsinki metropolitan area|Helsinki region]] is the largest urbanised area in Finland with {{formatnum: {{#expr: {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Helsinki}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Espoo}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Vantaa}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Mäntsälä}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Pornainen}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Kauniainen}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Kirkkonummi}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Vihti}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Nurmijärvi}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Hyvinkää}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Tuusula}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Kerava}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Järvenpää}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Sipoo}} }} }} inhabitants. The city of Helsinki is home to 12% of Finland's population. 19.9% of the population has a foreign background, which is twice above the national average. However, it is lower than in the major Finnish cities of [[Espoo]] or [[Vantaa]].<ref name="statistics-finland-population-2023-final"/>

At 53 percent of the population, women form a greater proportion of Helsinki residents than the national average of 51 percent. Helsinki's population density of 3,147 people per square kilometre makes Helsinki the most densely-populated city in Finland. The life expectancy for men and women is slightly below the national averages: 75.1 years for men as compared to 75.7 years, 81.7 years for women as compared to 82.5 years.<ref>{{cite web |last=Tapani Valkonen ym. |date=17 December 2007 |title=Tutkimuksia 10/2007: Elinajanodotteen kehitys Helsingissä ja sen väestönosaryhmissä 1991–2005 |url=http://www.hel.fi/hel2/tietokeskus/julkaisut/pdf/07_12_17_tutk_10_Valkonen.pdf |access-date=30 December 2007 |publisher=Helsingin kaupunki, tietokeskus |archive-date=8 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220308095129/https://www.hel.fi/hel2/tietokeskus/julkaisut/pdf/07_12_17_tutk_10_valkonen.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Tilastolaitoksen historiaa |title=Tilasto |url=http://www.stat.fi/org/historia/elinajanodote.html |access-date=13 April 2010 |publisher=Stat.fi |archive-date=24 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424015724/http://www.stat.fi/org/historia/elinajanodote.html }}</ref>

Helsinki has experienced strong growth since the 1810s, when it replaced [[Turku]] as the capital of the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], which later became the sovereign [[Republic of Finland]]. The city continued its growth from that time on, with an exception during the [[Finnish Civil War]]. From the end of [[World War II]] up until the 1970s there was a massive exodus of people from the countryside to the cities of Finland, in particular Helsinki. Between 1944 and 1969 the population of the city nearly doubled from 275,000<ref>{{cite web |title=Helsingin historia |url=http://www.hel.fi/hki/Helsinki/en/Etusivu |access-date=13 April 2010 |publisher=Hel.fi |archive-date=23 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523085802/http://www.hel.fi/hki/Helsinki/en/Etusivu }}</ref> to 525,600.<ref>{{cite web |date=30 December 1972 |title=Maan alle |url=http://www.aatos.fi/Hki450v/metro.html |access-date=13 April 2010 |publisher=Aatos.fi}}</ref>

The city of Helsinki is officially [[bilingual]], with both [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] as official languages. In 2023, the majority of the population, {{Formatnum: {{pct|{{Data Finland municipality/native language Finnish|Helsinki}}|{{Data Finland municipality/native language total|Helsinki}}|1}}}}, spoke Finnish as their [[first language|mother tongue]]. There were {{formatnum: {{Data Finland municipality/native language Swedish|Helsinki }} }} [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedish speakers]],  or {{Formatnum: {{pct|{{Data Finland municipality/native language Swedish|Helsinki}}|{{Data Finland municipality/native language total|Helsinki}}|1}}}}  of the population. The number of people who speak [[Sámi languages|Sámi]], Finland's third official language, is only {{formatnum: {{Data Finland municipality/native language Sami|Helsinki }} }} inhabitants.

Although few people speak the Sámi languages as their mother tongue, there are 527 people of Sami origin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stat.fi/tietotrendit/blogit/2021/oulusta-on-tullut-suomen-suurin-saamelaiskyla/ |title=Oulusta tullut Suomen suurin saamelaiskylä – Helsinki on viides &#124; Tieto&trendit |language=fi|publisher=Stat.fi |date= |access-date=5 May 2022}}</ref> There are 93 Tatar speakers in Helsinki, almost half of the total number of Tatar speakers in Finland.

[[Helsinki slang]] is a regional dialect of the city. Historically, it was a combination of Finnish and Swedish, with influences from Russian and German. Nowadays it has a strong English influence.

[[File:Helsinki Olympic Stadium Tower.jpg|thumb|Helsinki Olympic Stadium Tower]]
Helsinki has a long tradition of sports: the city gained much of its initial international recognition during the [[1952 Summer Olympics]], and the city has arranged sporting events such as the first [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Championships in Athletics]] 1983 and 2005, and the European Championships in Athletics 1971, 1994, and 2012. Helsinki hosts successful local teams in both of the most popular team sports in Finland: [[association football|football]] and [[ice hockey]]. Helsinki houses [[HJK Helsinki]], Finland's largest and most successful football club, and [[HIFK Fotboll|IFK Helsingfors]], their local rivals with 7 championship titles. The fixtures between the two are commonly known as [[Stadin derby]]. Helsinki's track and field club Helsingin Kisa-Veikot is also dominant within Finland. Ice hockey is popular among many Helsinki residents, who usually support either of the local clubs [[HIFK (ice hockey)|IFK Helsingfors]] (HIFK) or [[Jokerit]]. HIFK, with 14 Finnish championships titles, also plays in the highest [[bandy]] division,<ref>Video from the Finnish final 2009 against OLS from [[Oulu]]: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn-j0t5yxIE Youtube.com]</ref> along with [[Botnia-69]]. The Olympic stadium hosted the first [[Bandy World Championship]] in 1957.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Finnish Bandy Federation |url=http://www.finbandy.fi/info.htm |access-date=2 April 2016}}</ref>

Helsinki was elected host-city of the 1940 Summer Olympics, but due to World War II they were canceled. Instead Helsinki was the host of the 1952 Summer Olympics. The Olympics were a landmark event symbolically and economically for Helsinki and Finland as a whole that was recovering from the winter war and the continuation war fought with the Soviet Union. Helsinki was also in 1983 the first city to host the World Championships in Athletics. Helsinki also hosted the event in 2005, thus also becoming the first city to host the Championships for a second time. The [[Helsinki City Marathon]] has been held in the city every year since 1981, usually in August.<ref>[https://helsinkicityrunningday.fi/helsinkimaraton/ HELSINKI CITY MARATON 40-VUOTIS JUHLAMITALI – Helsinki City Running Day] (in Finnish)</ref> A [[Formula 3000]] race through the city streets was held on 25 May 1997. In 2009 Helsinki was host of the [[European Figure Skating Championships]], and in 2017 it hosted [[World Figure Skating Championships]]. The city will host the 2021 [[FIBA Under-19 Basketball World Cup]].  [[American football]] and the [[Vaahteraliiga]] has a strong tradition in the city dating back to the early 1980s.

Most of Helsinki's sports venues are under the responsibility of the city's sports office, such as 70 [[sports hall]]s and about 350 [[sports field]]s. There are nine [[ice rinks]], three of which are managed by the Helsinki Sports Agency (''Helsingin liikuntavirasto'').<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.hel.fi/liv/fi/liikuntaviraston-esittely/liikuntaviraston-esittely| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210624202307/https://www.hel.fi/liv/fi/liikuntaviraston-esittely/liikuntaviraston-esittely| archive-date = 24 June 2021| title = Liikuntaviraston esittely {{!}} Helsingin kaupunki}}</ref> In winter, there are seven artificial ice rinks.

==Transport==
===Roads===
[[File:Helsinki region roads.jpg|thumb|right|Helsinki region roads]]
The backbone of Helsinki's motorway network consists of three [[semicircle|semicircular]] [[ring road|beltways]], [[Ring I]], [[Ring II]], and [[Ring III]], which connect expressways heading to other parts of Finland, and the western and eastern arteries of ''[[Länsiväylä]]'' and ''[[Itäväylä]]'' respectively. While variants of a ''Keskustatunneli'' tunnel under the city centre have been repeatedly proposed, {{as of|2017|lc=y}} the plan remains on the drawing board.

Many important [[Highways in Finland|Finnish highways]] leave Helsinki for various parts of Finland; most of them in the form of [[motorway]]s, but a few of these exceptions include ''[[Vihdintie]]''. The most significant highways are:
* [[Finnish national road 1]]/[[European route E18|E18]] (to [[Lohja]], [[Salo, Finland|Salo]] and [[Turku]])
* [[Finnish national road 3]]/[[European route E12|E12]] (to [[Hämeenlinna]], [[Tampere]] and [[Vaasa]])
* [[Finnish national road 4]]/[[European route E75|E75]] (to [[Lahti]], [[Jyväskylä]], [[Oulu]] and [[Rovaniemi]])
* [[Finnish national road 7]]/[[European route E18|E18]] (to [[Porvoo]] and [[Kotka]]).

===Intercity rail===
[[File:Helsinki Railway Station 20050604.jpg|thumb|[[Helsinki Central railway station|Central railway station]], inaugurated 1919]]
[[Helsinki Central Railway Station]] is the main terminus of the rail network in Finland. Two rail corridors lead out of Helsinki, the Main Line to the north (to [[Tampere]], [[Oulu]], [[Rovaniemi]]), and the Coastal Line to the west (to [[Turku]]). The [[Finnish Main Line|Main Line]] (''päärata''), which is the first railway line in Finland, was officially opened on 17 March 1862, between cities of Helsinki and [[Hämeenlinna]].<ref>Neil Kent: ''Helsinki: A Cultural History'', p. 18. Interlink Books, 2014. {{ISBN|978-1-56656-544-8}}.</ref> The railway connection to the east branches from the Main Line outside of Helsinki at Kerava, and leads via [[Lahti]] to eastern parts of Finland.

A majority of intercity passenger services in Finland originate or terminate at the Helsinki Central Railway Station. All major cities in Finland are connected to Helsinki by rail service, with departures several times a day. The most frequent service is to Tampere, with more than 25 intercity departures per day {{as of|2017|lc=yes}}.

Until 2022 there also was an international services from Helsinki to Saint Petersburg and Moscow. The Saint Petersburg to Helsinki route was operated by [[Allegro (train)|Allegro high-speed trains]].

A [[Helsinki to Tallinn Tunnel]] has been proposed<ref>{{Cite news |date=6 January 2016 |title=Helsinki-Tallinn tunnel proposals look to bring cities closer than ever |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/helsinki-tallinn-tunnel-proposals-rail-link-finland-estonia}}</ref> and agreed upon by representatives of the cities.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Feargus O'Sullivan |date=7 January 2016 |title=Helsinki and Tallinn Agree to Build the World's Longest Underwater Rail Tunnel |work=CityLab |url=http://www.citylab.com/commute/2016/01/helsinki-tallinn-rail-tunnel-baltic/423030/}}</ref> The rail tunnel would connect Helsinki to the [[Estonia]]n capital [[Tallinn]], further linking Helsinki to the rest of continental Europe by [[Rail Baltica]].

===Aviation===
Air traffic is handled primarily from [[Helsinki Airport]], located approximately {{convert|17|km|mi|0}} north of Helsinki's downtown area, in the neighbouring city of [[Vantaa]]. Helsinki's own airport, [[Helsinki-Malmi Airport]], is mainly used for general and private aviation. Charter flights are available from [[Hernesaari Heliport]].

===Sea transport===
{{Main|Port of Helsinki}}
[[File:Helsinki (23883925315).jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The [[South Harbour, Helsinki|South Harbour]]]]
Like many other cities, Helsinki was deliberately founded at a location on the sea in order to take advantage of shipping. The freezing of the sea imposed limitations on sea traffic up to the end of the 19th century. But for the last hundred years, the routes leading to Helsinki have been kept open even in winter with the aid of [[icebreaker]]s, many of them built in the Helsinki Hietalahti shipyard. The arrival and departure of ships has also been a part of everyday life in Helsinki. Regular route traffic from Helsinki to Stockholm, Tallinn, and Saint Petersburg began as far back as 1837. Over 300 cruise ships and 360,000 cruise passengers visit Helsinki annually. There are international cruise ship docks in [[South Harbour, Helsinki|South Harbour]], [[Katajanokka]], [[West Harbour, Helsinki|West Harbour]], and [[Hernesaari]]. In terms of combined liner and cruise passengers, the [[Port of Helsinki]] overtook the [[Port of Dover]] in 2017 to become the [[List of busiest cruise ports by passengers|busiest passenger port in the world]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/pdfscache/6652.pdf|title=Maritime ports freight and passenger statistics|publisher=[[Eurostat]]|access-date=18 June 2020}}</ref>

Ferry connections to Tallinn, [[Mariehamn]], and Stockholm are serviced by various companies; very popular [[MS J. L. Runeberg|MS ''J. L. Runeberg'']] ferry connection to Finland's second oldest city, [[medieval]] old town of [[Porvoo]], is also available for tourists.<ref>[https://www.msjlruneberg.fi/cruises/helsinki-porvoo/ Helsinki–Porvoo cruise - MS ''J.

The [[Helsinki commuter rail|commuter rail system]] includes purpose-built double track for local services in two rail corridors along intercity railways, and the [[Ring Rail Line]], an urban double-track railway with a station at the [[Helsinki Airport]] in Vantaa. Electric operation of commuter trains was first begun in 1969, and the system has been gradually expanded since. 15 different services are operated {{as of|2017|lc=yes}}, some extending outside of the Helsinki region. The frequent services run at a 10-minute headway in peak traffic.
