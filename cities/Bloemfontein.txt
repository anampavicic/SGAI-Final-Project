==History==
===Early history===
Though historically a [[Khoekhoe|!Orana]] and [[Barolong]] settlement, and then a [[Afrikaner|Boer]] settlement, Bloemfontein was officially founded in 1846 as a fort by [[British Army]] major [[Henry Douglas Warden]] as a British outpost in the Transoranje region, at that stage occupied by various groups of peoples including !Orana (so-called "Korana" of the ǀHõaǁʼaes, ǀHũdiǁʼaes, Einiǁʼaes, and others), [[Cape Colony]] [[Trek Boers]], [[Griqua people|Griqua]] (at that time known as "Baasters") and [[Barolong]].

Warden initially chose the site primarily because of its proximity to the main route to [[Winburg]], the spacious open country, and the absence of [[African horse sickness|horse sickness]]. Bloemfontein was the original farm of Johannes Nicolaas Brits, born on 21 February 1790, owner and first inhabitant of Bloemfontein. Johann – as he was known – sold the farm to Major Warden.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bloemfonteinguide.co.za/about-bloemfontein/history/|title=History of Bloemfontein, Free State, South Africa|newspaper=Bloemfontein Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170121041821/http://www.bloemfonteinguide.co.za/about-bloemfontein/history/|archive-date=21 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

With colonial policy shifts, the region changed into the [[Orange River Sovereignty]] (1848–1854) and eventually the [[Orange Free State]] Republic (1854–1902). From 1902 to 1910, it served as the capital of the [[Orange River Colony]] and since that time as the provincial capital of the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]]. In 1910, it became the Judicial capital of the [[Union of South Africa]]. A possible etymology for the city's name is that it is called Bloemfontein {{lit}} "Bloem's fountain", after Jan Bloem II, a Griqua leader.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/prehistory-bloemfontein-area|title=Prehistory of the Bloemfontein area &#124; South African History Online|website=www.sahistory.org.za|accessdate=11 March 2023}}</ref>

===Orange Free State (1854–1902)===
[[File:Statue de Brand à Bloemfontein.jpg|left|thumb|233x233px|Early 20th century photo of a statue of the 19th century President [[Johannes Brand]] of the [[Orange Free State]]]]
The [[Orange Free State]] was an independent [[Boer Republics|Boer Republic]] in [[southern Africa]] during the second half of the 19th century. Extending between the [[Orange River|Orange]] and [[Vaal River|Vaal]] rivers, its borders were determined by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1848 when the region was proclaimed as the [[Orange River Sovereignty]], with a seat of a [[British Resident]] in Bloemfontein.

As the capital of the Orange Free State Republic, the growth and maturing of the republic resulted in the development of Bloemfontein. The city constructed numerous public buildings that remain in use today, facilitated by the republic's governance and compensation from the British for the loss of the diamond-rich [[Griqualand|Griqua Land]] area.<ref>David Johnson, "Griqua Land Claims in Southern Africa, 1874-1998", in David L. Eng and David Kazanjian, eds., "Loss: The Politics of Mourning" (Berkeley: Univ. of CA Press, 2003), 283-88. {{ISBN|0520232364}}</ref> The old Orange Free State's presidential residence, the [[Old Presidency]], is currently a museum and cultural space in the city.

A railway line was built in 1890 connecting Bloemfontein to [[Cape Town]]. The railway line provided a centrally located [[Bloemfontein railway station|railway station]] and proved critical to the British in occupying the city later.

The writer [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] was born in the city on 3 January 1892. However, his family left [[Orange Free State]] (now [[Free State (province)|Free State province]], South Africa) following the death of his father, [[Arthur Tolkien]], when Tolkien was three (1895).<ref>{{cite book |last=Carpenter |first=Humphrey |title=Tolkien: A Biography |title-link=J.

Humphrey Carpenter (London: Allen Unwin, 1981; London: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2014), 165. {{ISBN|0544363795}}</ref>

In 1899, the city was the site of the [[Bloemfontein Conference]], which failed to prevent the outbreak of the [[Second Boer War]]. The conference was a final attempt to avert a war between Britain and the [[South African Republic]], and its failure set the stage for war, which broke out on 11 October 1899.

On 13 March 1900, following the [[Battle of Paardeberg]], the British captured the city and built a [[Second Boer War concentration camps|concentration camp]] nearby to house [[Boers|Boer]] women and children. In 1913, the [[National Women's Monument]] was constructed on the outskirts of the city to commemorate all Boer civilians who died in concentration camps during the war.<ref>Grundlingh, Albert.

=== Unionisation of South Africa (1910s) ===
On 31 May 1910, exactly eight years after the Boers signed the [[Treaty of Vereeniging|Peace Treaty of Vereeniging]] that ended the Anglo-Boer War between the [[British Empire]] and two [[Boer]] [[State (polity)|states]], the [[South African Republic]] (Republic of Transvaal) and the [[Orange Free State]], South Africa became a Union.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/union-south-africa-1910|title=The Union of South Africa 1910|last=tinashe|date=2011-11-08|work=South African History Online|access-date=2017-12-16}}</ref>

Due to disagreements over where the Union's capital should be, a compromise was reached that allowed Bloemfontein to host [[Appellate Division (South Africa)|Appellate Division]] and become the Union's judicial capital.<ref>Section 109 of South Africa Act, 1909</ref> Bloemfontein was also given financial compensation.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/jstor-2212266|title=The South Africa Act, 1909|date=1 January 1910|publisher=The American Journal of International Law|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

On 8 January 1912, the [[African National Congress|South African Native National Congress]] (SANNC) was founded in Bloemfontein. The Union of South Africa had not granted rights to black South Africans, causing the organisation's creation. Its primary aim was to fight for the rights of black South Africans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/organisations/african-national-congress-anc|title=African National Congress (ANC)|last=sahoboss|date=2011-03-20|work=South African History Online|access-date=2017-12-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220091912/http://www.sahistory.org.za/organisations/african-national-congress-anc|archive-date=20 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the implementation of [[pass laws]], the city saw major demonstrations that forced South African authorities to exempt women from them for nearly four decades.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Clark|first=Nancy L.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/883649263|title=South Africa : the rise and fall of apartheid|date=2016|others=William H.

From 1 to 9 January 1914, [[J. B. M. Hertzog|James Barry Munnik Hertzog]] and his supporters met in Bloemfontein to form the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party of the Orange Free State]], and to lay down its principles, following Hertzog's exit from the [[South African Party]] in 1913.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/national-party-np|title=National Party (NP)|last=sahoboss|date=2011-03-30|work=South African History Online|access-date=2017-12-16}}</ref> The National Party grew to govern South Africa in 1948 and implement the policy of [[racial segregation]] known as [[apartheid]].

===Apartheid era (1948–1994)===

When the National Party won the [[1948 South African general election|1948 South African national government elections]], they began implementing the policy known as [[apartheid]]. The policy was built on separate development of ethnic groups, and racial segregation was enforced. In Bloemfontein, residential segregation had begun in the 19th century with the passing of Ordinance 1 of 1860, which determined that no non-white, without written permission from the landlord (British government), had the right to occupy urban land in towns where local municipalities did not yet exist. On 3 June 1861, the council demarcated three locations in the following areas; the black population was to move to the area that lay to the right of a neighbourhood that was known as Kaffirfontein, Coloureds were to move to the [[Waaihoek]] Black residential area on the eastern outskirts of the town. The inhabitants of these settlements had to pay the so-called hut tax and grazing rights tax.<ref name= "bloemfotein1">{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/bloemfontein-segregated-city|publisher=SA History Online| title=Bloemfontein the Segregated city|date=2011-03-30}}</ref> This laid the foundation for the implementation of residential urban segregation as envisaged by the architects of apartheid.

When the [[South Africa]]n [[apartheid]] government passed the [[Group Areas Act]] of 1950, the Bloemfontein municipality put into effect changes in the racial set-up of the city. The municipality demolished the Cape Stands residential area, which was occupied by the city's [[Coloureds|coloured population]], and moved the residents to [[Heidedal]]. However, due to Coloureds living in such proximity to black people, [[Interracial marriage|intermarriages across racial lines]] occurred, resulting in a partially mixed population in [[Heidedal]] and [[Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality|Mangaung]]. In 1952, the Bloemfontein municipality began building new residential areas for the city's black population. New residential areas to separate ethnic groups such as [[Sotho people|Sotho]], [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and [[Tswana people|Tswana]] were formed. The residential areas were jointly known as Mangaung.<ref name= "bloemfotein1"/>  Phahameng, a [[Sotho people|Sotho]] township, was the first formal housing projects to be approved by the municipality in 1956. Physical buffers such as the railway line and roads were put into place to separate black ethnic groups, the white and coloured population. Eleven thousand housing structures, of which approximately 6,000 were government-built rental accommodations, were erected in Mangaung between 1952 and 1968.<ref name="bloemfotein2">{{cite web|url=https://www.uniassignment.com/essay-samples/cultural-studies/review-of-apartheid-in-bloemfontein-verno-cultural-studies-essay.php|publisher=Uni Assignment|title=Review of Apartheid in Bloemfontein Verno Cultural Studies Essay|access-date=5 December 2017|archive-date=1 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211001150408/https://www.uniassignment.com/essay-samples/cultural-studies/review-of-apartheid-in-bloemfontein-verno-cultural-studies-essay.php|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1968, Mangaung faced severe housing shortages when as many as 3,000 to 6,000 housing units were needed. To counter this problem, a 55&nbsp;km eastward expansion called [[Botshabelo]] was added in 1979. The Bloemfontein municipality channelled off all black urbanisation to [[Thaba Nchu]] and Botshabelo, which were developed as a source of cheap labour for the city of Bloemfontein. A subsidised bus service was established, and Botshabelo was declared a decentralisation point, meaning it was designated to become an industrial development point to reduce the distance between the place of employment and the place of residence.

In 1988, approximately 14,500 people were commuting daily between [[Botshabelo]] and Bloemfontein. This meant that 55% of Botshabelo's workforce was employed outside the city.<ref name= "bloemfotein3">{{cite web|url=https://impulscentrum.be/south_africa/mod4_fringe/lesson11.asp|publisher=Impuls centrum|title=Apartheid and housing in Mangaung and Botshabelo|access-date=5 December 2017|archive-date=6 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206074617/https://impulscentrum.be/south_africa/mod4_fringe/lesson11.asp|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1994, after the disestablishment of the apartheid government, Bloemfontein, Botshabelo, and Thaba Nchu became part of [[Motheo District Municipality]]. The [[Motheo District Municipality]] was disestablished on 18 May 2011, and Mangaung was upgraded to become an autonomous metropolitan municipality with Bloemfontein as the main seat.

===Since 1994===
Until 1994, the city was South Africa's sole judicial capital. It remains the seat for the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]] (formerly the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court). The city is also an administrative centre with many private hospitals and educational institutions.

==Government==
Free State Provincial Government building
Bloemfontein forms part of the [[Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality]], which was upgraded from a [[Local Municipality (South Africa)|Local Municipality]] in 2011.

The Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality elects a municipal council for five-year periods through a [[Mixed-member proportional representation|mixed-member proportional representation (MMP)]] system in which wards elect individual councillors alongside those named from party lists. Voters get two votes: one for a representative to become a ward councillor and the other for a political party. The latter vote distributes seats in the municipal council amongst parties, while the former distributes seats through the individual representatives.

Bloemfontein is located in central South Africa on the southern edge of the [[Highveld]] at an elevation of {{Convert|1400|m|ft}}, bordering on the semi-arid region of the [[Karoo]]. The area is generally flat with occasional hills ("koppies" in [[Afrikaans]]), and the general vegetation is [[Highveld]] grassland. 

Bloemfontein experiences a [[Semi-arid climate|Cold Semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] BSk), with hot summer days and cool, dry winters with frosty nights. Rainfall usually arrives in the summer months, often in the form of dramatic but short-lived afternoon/evening thunderstorms that serve as a temporary relief from the heat. The city tends to be dry and dusty in winter with freezing nights and mostly mild, sunny days. Frost is very common but snow is rare.

There are two main cemeteries in Bloemfontein:
* The Old Cemetery: Over 1,000 names from the three cemeteries. Old: The oldest of the three cemeteries, dating from 1871, is simply a tiny fenced-off area of a public cemetery near the city centre. It includes a few graves of several Jewish pioneers involved in the city's early days who died serving on either side in the Boer War, 1899–1902. Each of these pioneer families' thirty or so tombstones has been completely transcribed.
* South Park: This cemetery was consecrated in 1978 and now includes over 10,000 graves. It is the biggest cemetery in the Free State.<ref>{{cite web|title=BLOEMFONTEIN - Free State Prov|url=http://www.iajgsjewishcemeteryproject.org/south-africa/bloemfontein.html|publisher=International Jewish Cemetery Project|access-date=19 August 2012}}</ref>

There is also the old Phahameng cemetery, which dates back to the 1960s and was explicitly reserved for Africans during the [[Apartheid|apartheid era]] and has a Heroes Acre, where freedom fighters are laid to rest.
The Heide Heights cemetery in Heidedal was reserved for coloured people during the apartheid era, but all races could bury their dead after 1994. This cemetery has been closed due to it being full.

==Community service organisations==
* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080123182124/http://www.roundtable158.co.za/ Round Table 158 Bloemfontein] The first [[Round Table (club)|Round Table]] was formed in [[Norwich]], England in 1927. The founder, [[Louis Marchesi]], was a young member of the Norwich Rotary Club who felt a need existed for a club where the young business owners of the town could gather regularly. At their meetings, they could exchange ideas, learn from the experiences of their colleagues, and play a collective part in the civic life of Norwich. From a very early stage, it was agreed that Round Table would be a non-religious, non-political club, which has continued to this day.
