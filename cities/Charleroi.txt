==History==
[[File:Charleroi - Ferraris map (1770-1778).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Map of Charleroi in 1770s]]

The Charleroi area was already settled in the [[prehistoric]] period, with traces of metallurgical and commercial activities along the [[Sambre]]. Several public buildings, temples and villas were built in the area in the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period. Burial places, with jewels and weapons, have been found. The first written mention of a place called Charnoy dates from a 9th-century offering in the [[Lobbes]] abbey, which lists various neighboring towns and related [[tithe]] duties. During the [[Middle Ages]], Charnoy was one of the many small hamlets in the area, with no more than about 50 inhabitants, part of the [[County of Namur]].

===Foundation===
Spanish territorial losses in the 1659 [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] left a gap between the key fortresses of [[Mons, Belgium|Mons]] and [[Namur]]; to fill this, [[Francisco Castel Rodrigo]], then Governor of the Spanish Netherlands, expropriated land around Charnoy to build a fortress near the Sambre. In September 1666, it was renamed Charle-roi, or King Charles, in honour of five-year-old [[Charles II of Spain]]; the [[chronogram]] F'''V'''N'''D'''AT'''V'''R '''C'''ARO'''L'''OREG'''IVM''' (MDCLVVVI) can be found in the register of the parish of Charnoy.<ref name="Belgium & Luxembourg">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/belgiumluxembour00dunf_0 | url-access=registration | page=[https://archive.org/details/belgiumluxembour00dunf_0/page/303 303] | quote=charleroi 1666. |title = Belgium & Luxembourg| publisher=Rough Guides |isbn = 9781858288710|last1 = Dunford|first1 = Martin|last2 = Lee|first2 = Phil|year = 2002}}</ref>

Construction had only just begun when the [[War of Devolution]] with France began in 1667, and the Spanish withdrew. France retained the town under the 1668 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], and its fortifications were completed by [[Vauban]]. A bridge was built over the Sambre, connecting the ''Ville Haute'' and ''Ville Basse'', with incentives offered to persuade people to settle there. The French relinquished control in 1678, and although it changed hands several times over the next 50 years, the town remained part of the Netherlands until the foundation of modern Belgium.<ref>{{cite web |title=Charleroi |url=http://www.fortified-places.com/charleroi/default.htm |website=Fortified Places |access-date=2 March 2020 |archive-date=11 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191111170450/http://www.fortified-places.com/charleroi/default.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===1666–1830===
[[File:Charleroi - plan-relief - copie.jpg|thumb|Copy of the [[plan-relief]] of Charleroi made in 1696. View from the southwest. On display at the Town Hall.]]
Shortly after its foundation, the new city was in turn besieged by the Dutch, ceded to the Spanish in 1678 ([[Treaty of Nijmegen]]), taken by the French in 1693, ceded again to the Spanish in 1698 ([[Treaty of Rijswijk]]), then taken by the French, the Dutch and the Austrians in 1714 ([[Treaty of Baden (1714)|Treaty of Baden]]). The [[France|French]] [[Prince of Conti]] took the city again in 1745, but it was ceded back to [[Austria]] in 1748, beginning a period of prosperity under [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. Glass, steel and coal industries, which had already sprung up a century earlier, could now flourish.

Trouble began again in 1790, the year of the civil uprising that eventually led to the [[United States of Belgium]]. The Austrians occupied the city, were forced out by the French after the [[Battle of Jemappes]] on 6 November 1792, and took it back again four months later. On 12 June 1794, the French revolutionary [[Army of Sambre-et-Meuse]] under the command of [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]], invested Charleroi and won a decisive victory in the ensuing [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]]. The city took the revolutionary name of Libre-sur-Sambre until 1800. After France's defeat in 1814, the whole area was annexed to the [[Netherlands]], and new walls were built around the city. [[Napoleon]] stayed in Charleroi for a couple of days in June 1815, just before the [[Battle of Waterloo]].

===1830 to present===
[[File:Charleroi - pont de la gare - mai 1940 - 01.jpg|left|thumb|The station bridge partially collapsed in May 1940 under the effect of French army explosives.]]
The [[Belgian Revolution]] of 1830 gave the area its freedom from the Netherlands and ushered in a new era of prosperity, still based mostly on glass, metallurgy and coal, hence the area's name, ''Pays Noir'' ("Black Country"). After the [[Industrial Revolution]], Charleroi benefited from the increased use of coke in the metallurgical industry. People from across [[Europe]] were attracted by the economic opportunities, and the population grew rapidly.

Following the [[Industrial Revolution]] in [[Wallonia]], Charleroi from the 1850s–1860s became one of the most important places where labor strikes broke out. In 1886, 12 strikers were killed by the Belgian army in [[Roux, Belgium|Roux]]. In the 1880s, miners in [[Province of Hainaut|Hainaut]] were recruited by the Dominion Coal Company in [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia]].<ref>But a consular report indicated they were dissatisfied with wages and working conditions, and they moved to other mining centers. These Walloon miners were experienced in organizing unions and working-men's associations. They immigrated also to collieries on [[Vancouver Island]] in Canada. See Louis Balthazar, Leen Haenens, ''Images of Canadianness: Visions on Canada's Politics, Culture, Economics'', International Council for Canadian Studies, University of Ottawa Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-7766-0489-9}}.</ref> These miners were anxious to flee the repression following bloody strikes and riots in [[Liège]] and Charleroi<ref>Louis Balthazar and Leen Haenens, ''Images of Canadianness: Visions on Canada's Politics, Culture, Economics'', International Council for Canadian Studies, University of Ottawa Press, 1998, p. 73, {{ISBN|0-7766-0489-9}}.</ref> during the [[Walloon Jacquerie of 1886]]. Walloon miners from Charleroi also emigrated to [[Alberta]], Canada.<ref>
Miners from Wallonia began arriving at the collieries in Alberta to work for West Canadian Collieries, founded in 1903 by a group of French and Belgian entrepreneurs, and for Canadian Coal Consolidated, a [[Paris]]-based firm. Léon Cabeaux, a well-known union leader, who had organized a particularly [[Walloon Jacquerie of 1886|violent strike]] in Hainaut in 1886, settled in [[Lethbridge]] and soon attracted disgruntled compatriots from the collieries in [[Pennsylvania]] in the US. The miners soon became deeply involved in labor radicalism, because in Alberta the [[mine disaster]]s were among the worst anywhere, and there were no provisions for the welfare of families of the miners maimed or killed in the workplace. Frank Soulet, Joseph Lothier and Gustave Henry emerged as dedicated socialist union leaders. in Louis Balthazar and Leen Haenens, ''Images of Canadianness: Visions on Canada's Politics, Culture, Economics'', International Council for Canadian Studies, University of Ottawa Press, 1998, p. 75, {{ISBN|0-7766-0489-9}}.</ref> The working men of Charleroi always played an important role in [[Belgian general strikes]] and particularly during the Belgian general strike of 1936, the [[Royal Question|general strike against Leopold III of Belgium]], and the [[Belgian general strike of 1960–1961|1960–1961 winter general strike]].

By 1871, the fortified walls around the city were completely torn down.

[[Battle of Charleroi|Heavy fighting]] took place during [[World War I]] due to the city's strategic location on the Sambre. The city was badly damaged with further destruction only being prevented by the [[Couillet Treaty]] agreed with the German forces which required the payment of 10 million Belgian Francs, foodstuffs, vehicles and armaments.<ref>{{cite news|author=Harriet O'Brien |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/charleroi-phoenix-from-the-flames-8658772.html |title=Charleroi: Phoenix from the flames &#124; Europe &#124; Travel |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |access-date=2016-08-07}}</ref> The magazine ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'', which featured the popular cartoon characters [[Lucky Luke]] and [[the Smurfs]], was launched by the publishing company [[Éditions Dupuis]] in 1938.<ref name="independent1">{{cite news|title=Charleroi: A richly rewarding gem &#124; Europe &#124; Travel|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/charleroi-a-richly-rewarding-gem-2348130.html|access-date=7 August 2016}}</ref> After [[World War II]], Charleroi witnessed a general decline of its heavy industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theculturetrip.com/europe/belgium/articles/the-10-best-things-to-see-and-do-in-charleroi-belgium/|title=The 10 Best Things To Do In Charleroi, Belgium|first=Ester|last=Meerman|website=Culture Trip|date=10 April 2018}}</ref> Following the merger with several surrounding municipalities in 1977, the city {{as of | 2013 | lc = on}} ranks as the largest city in [[Wallonia]] and the 4th largest in Belgium.

=== Logotype ===
As part of the effort to improve its identity, the city adopted a new logo and [[graphic charter]] in early 2015, designed by the Brussels studio Pam and Jenny.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Le logo de la ville de Charleroi plébiscité par un magazine canadien |url=https://www.rtbf.be/article/le-logo-de-la-ville-de-charleroi-plebiscite-par-un-magazine-canadien-9168950 |access-date=2022-07-28 |website=RTBF |language=fr}}</ref>

The crown of three triangles above the C has several meanings:<ref>{{Cite web |title=IDENTITÉ GRAPHIQUE DE CHARLEROI |url=http://www.charleroi-bouwmeester.be/identity-charleroi-logo |access-date=2022-07-28 |website=CHARLEROI BOUWMEESTER |language=fr-BE}}</ref>

* The triangular shape evokes the [[slag heaps]], yesterday black and today green, which symbolise the city's industrial past and its factories.
* It also recalls the crest of the cockerel designed by [[Pierre Paulus]] and [[Wallonia|symbol of Wallonia]].
* The crown refers to [[Charles II of Spain|King Charles II]] who gave his name to the city at the time of its foundation.
* The typography used is also very similar to that used in the logo of [[Ateliers de Constructions Electriques de Charleroi|ACEC]], a historic company founded, developed and finally closed down in Charleroi in 1989 after more than a century of existence.

==Geography==
[[File:Map Charleroi.svg|left|thumb|The 15 districts of Charleroi, in Roman numerals, with the surrounding municipalities labelled with letters|alt=Charleroi has 15 districts, and is surrounded by nine other municipalities]]

The municipality of Charleroi straddles both banks of the river [[Sambre]] in an area marked by industrial activities ([[coal mining]] and [[steel industry]]), which has been nicknamed the ''[[Pays Noir]]'' ("Black Country"), part of the larger ''[[sillon industriel]]''. Even though most of the factories have closed since the 1950s, the landscape remains dotted with [[spoil tip]]s and old industrial buildings.

Charleroi lies around {{convert|50|km}} south of [[Brussels]].

The [[Municipalities in Belgium|municipality]] comprises:
*I. the central district of Charleroi

and the following former municipalities, now [[Deelgemeente|sections]], merged into Charleroi in 1977:

=== Topography and hydrography ===
[[File:Charleroi_-_2019-08-24_-_04_-_quai_Arthur_Rimbaud_et_quai_de_Sambre.jpg|thumb|The Quai Arthur Rimbaud (formerly Quai de Brabant) along the [[Sambre]] after renovation]]
The topography of Charleroi is influenced by the valley of the river [[Sambre]], which flows from west to east before joining the [[Meuse]] at [[Namur]]. The [[Piéton]] river flows from north to south to join the Sambre at [[Dampremy]]. The [[Brussels–Charleroi Canal|Charleroi-Brussels canal]] is dug in the valley of this stream. The [[Eau d'Heure]] river comes from the south and also flows into the Sambre at [[Marchienne-au-Pont]]. About twenty streams run through the territory of the municipality.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Carte d'identité du sous-bassin hydrographique de la Sambre |url=https://www.crsambre.be/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Carte-d%E2%80%99identit%C3%A9-du-sous-bassin-hydrographique-de-la-Sambre.pdf |access-date=2022-07-29 |website=Contrat de Rivière Sambre & Affluents |language=fr-FR }}</ref>

The altitude ranges from 100 metres (Sambre and Piéton valleys) to over 220 metres at the [[Bois du Prince]] in [[Marcinelle]]. The level is 132 metres on the [[Place Charles II]]. The height of the slag heaps often exceeds 200 metres, the Saint-Charles slag heap in the [[Bois du Cazier]] reaches 241 metres.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/66924806 |title=Topografische atlas België = Atlas topographique Belgique : 1:50.000 |date=2002 |publisher=Touring |others=Marcel, Fietsgidsen Gevaert, Nationaal Geografisch Instituut |isbn=90-209-4853-9 |location=[Brussel] |pages=206–207 |oclc=66924806}}</ref>

=== Biodiversity ===
The six slag heaps in the [[Pays Noir]] are reservoirs of biodiversity that should be preserved.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Biodiversity 2020, Update of Belgium's National Strategy {{!}} Convention on Biological Diversity |url=https://www.biodiv.be/documents/BE-national-strategy |access-date=2022-07-29 |website=www.biodiv.be}}</ref>

Like the [[calcareous grassland]], the slag heaps are habitats created by human activity that are home to many very specific and often threatened animal and plant species. The rarity of these species depends on the rarity of the environment itself (the [[biotope]]). [[Biodiversity]] is also present in other environments: in a wasteland, a body of water, a meadow, etc. In terms of biodiversity, it is therefore preferable to maintain a mosaic of habitats, hence the interest in preserving different types of environments on the slag heaps.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Danna-Allegrini |first1=Brunella |last2=Henry |first2=Marion |date=2020-01-01 |title=Charleroi: Slag Heaps and New Landscape |url=https://revistas.upr.edu/images/informa/2020/v12/e2.pdf |journal=Informa |language=en |volume=12 |pages=32–38 |issn=2637-7950}}</ref>

The Viviers site, for example, is an [[Coal mining|old mining site]] located in the east of Charleroi ([[Gilly, Belgium|Gilly]]). This site has a small conical [[slag heap]] and large open areas consisting mainly of pioneer grassland and wasteland. It also includes a small body of water as well as temporary ponds, and some wooded areas on the western and northern edges. This particular biotope is of great biological interest and acts as a refuge for a diverse fauna. The vast [[reed bed]] surrounding the pond is home to the [[red warbler]], a [[passerine bird]] specific to this type of vegetation. Several species of amphibians can be seen here, including a population of the [[natterjack toad]], as well as certain insects, such as the magnificent [[Oedipoda caerulescens|blue-winged grasshopper]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=2638 - Terril des Viviers {{!}} Rechercher un site intéressant ou protégé {{!}} Sites {{!}} La biodiversité en Wallonie |url=http://biodiversite.wallonie.be/fr/2638-terril-des-viviers.html?IDD=251661361&IDC=1881# |access-date=2022-07-29 |website=biodiversite.wallonie.be}}</ref>

The Martinet site, a former colliery on the boundary of the [[Monceau-sur-Sambre]] and Roux sections, is in the process of being rehabilitated and reallocated. Like the Viviers slag heap in Gilly, this vast site is of great biological interest.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Terril du Martinet (FR) |url=https://www.destinationterrils.eu/en/terril-du-martinet |access-date=2022-07-29 |website=Destination Terrils |language=en}}</ref>

===Climate===
Similar to the rest of Belgium Charleroi has an [[oceanic climate]] as a result of the [[Gulf Stream]] influence warming winters, while also moderating summer warmth in spite of its inland position.

==Politics==
Before the merger of municipalities, from [[Belgian Revolution|Belgian independence]] in 1830 until 1 January 1977 (with the exception of the period linked to the [[Second World War]]), Charleroi only experienced liberal mayors and majorities. The municipal elections in 1976, just before the merger of municipalities, brought an absolute majority for the [[Socialist Party (Belgium)|Socialist Party (Parti Socialiste or PS)]], and Lucien Harmegnies, previous minister and until then mayor of [[Marcinelle]], became the first socialist mayor of the new entity. Since 1977, the Socialist Party has constantly been part of the political majority within the municipal council, either holding an absolute majority or being in coalition with other parties.
[[File:Charleroi - hôtel de ville vu de la place Charles II - 2014-08-07.jpg|thumb|Charleroi's Town Hall]]
In 2005, numerous judicial affairs put into question Charleroi's elected socialist municipal councillors. The media resonance and the impact were significant at local, regional and even national level. At local level, the PS lost its absolute majority as a result of the municipality elections of 8 October 2006.
{{See also|Carolorégienne affair}}

At the elections of October 2012, the PS, under the leadership of [[Paul Magnette]], regained the absolute majority at the municipal council. Mayor Paul Magnette chose, however, to open the socialist majority and to reconduct the coalition of socialists, liberals and centrists.<ref name="52 serments devant 500 spectateurs">[http://www.lavenir.net/article/detail.aspx?articleid=DMF20121204_00240104 52 serments devant 500 spectateurs], [[L'Avenir (Belgique)|L'Avenir]], {{date|4|décembre|2012}}</ref> At the municipal elections of 2018, Magnette, re-elected mayor, opened the socialist city majority to ecologists and centrists (C+).

==Economy==
Charleroi was in the center of a coal basin as well as steel and glass industries. Even so, due to the widespread loss in industrial power in the area since the 1970s, the coal and steel areas experienced a significant decline for most of the 1980s and 1990s.

From these industrial activities, the region of Charleroi has inherited a wide industrial area for electrical engineering and production of iron, steel, glass and chemicals. The conglomerate [[ArcelorMittal]] subdivided its [[Industeel]] unit to encompass the Charleroi steelworks.<ref name="nlejsl">{{cite news |title=ArcelorMittal se donne six mois pour vendre Industeel |url=https://www.lejsl.com/economie/2020/11/20/arcelormittal-se-donne-six-mois-pour-vendre-industeel |publisher=Le Journal de Saône et Loire |date=20 November 2020}}</ref><ref name="jlejsl">{{cite news |title=Vente d'Industeel : la CGT en appelle à l'intervention de l'Etat |url=https://www.lejsl.com/economie/2021/01/11/vente-d-industeel-la-cgt-en-appelle-a-l-intervention-de-l-etat |publisher=Le Journal de Saône et Loire |date=11 January 2021}}</ref>

Moreover, from the early 2000s, the overall economy of the area has diversified to include health care, logistics, biotechnologies, energy (Suez), railway transportation (Alstom) and telecommunications (Alcatel).

More recently, other sectors have developed, mainly civil and military aeronautics (SABCA, SONACA), logistics, printing and biotechnology. The aeronautics and space industry is developing rapidly around Charleroi-Brussels-South airport with the foundation of two university research centres: the Center of Excellence in Information Technologies (CETIC) serving as a center of expertise for the development of Walloon companies and founded by UCLouvain with the universities of Namur and Mons, as well as the Cenaero (Centre for research in aeronautics) of the University of Liège (ULiège), the University of Louvain (UCLouvain) and the University of Brussels (ULB).

Likewise, the Brussels South Charleroi Airport has evolved in a major commercial success with a grow of passengers from 210.000 in 1998<ref>{{cite web|access-date=22 May 2023|title=Statistiques et chiffres clés|url=https://www.brussels-charleroi-airport.com/fr/statistiques-et-chiffres-cles|website=Brussels South Charleroi Airport}}<!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --></ref> to 8.3 millions passengers in 2023.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Agence Belga|title=L'aéroport de Charleroi dépasse sa fréquentation pré-Covid, Liège et Bruxelles progressent en 2022|periodical=La Dernière Heure|date=30 January 2023|url=https://www.dhnet.be/conso/vacances/2023/01/30/laeroport-de-charleroi-depasse-sa-frequentation-pre-covid-liege-et-bruxelles-progressent-en-2022-IZ2P23AT6ZEYRPZJCJIBYILVPQ/}}</ref> Therefore, it has become the second airport of Belgium for passenger transport which is a  substantial asset for the economical and commercial development of the region of Charleroi. The activity of the airport thus generates numerous direct and indirect jobs.

The Intercommunale Igretec is the official body of the region of Charleroi giving assistance and support for the installation and development of high-tech companies around the airport and in the region of Charleroi.

Charleroi is also connected through highways with all the major cities of Belgium and the French border. It has also a port ("Port autonome de Charleroi") and a river network giving access to three major ports (Dunkirk, Antwerp and Rotterdam).

From the 1990s, two big shopping malls (Ville 2 and Rive Gauche), cinemas and even a local craft brewery have been created in and around the city center also bringing back shops and customers downtown.

==Education==
Charleroi is Belgium's biggest city without having its own university. In 1966 the [[UCLouvain|University of Louvain]] began operations in Charleroi with three faculties on its [[UCLouvain Charleroi]] campus based in the city center and in [[Montignies-sur-Sambre]], including the [[Louvain School of Management]] and, more recently, the [[Louvain School of Engineering]], issuing Bachelor's and Master's degrees and conducting research. Other universities have since started operations in Charleroi, including the Universities of [[Université de Namur|Namur]], [[University of Mons|Mons]] and the ''[[Université libre de Bruxelles]]''.

Thanks to the [[European Regional Development Fund]] (ERDF) of the [[European Union]], a Campus of Sciences, Art and Trade is currently being developed in downtown Charleroi.  This Campus, located on the site of the University of Labor, will constitute a real center of excellence for training - teaching - research in the city center equipped with a Cité des Métiers, a University Center, a Center for Technological Higher Education, a “Design – Innovation” Competence Center.

The [[Brussels South Charleroi Airport]] in [[Gosselies]], {{convert|7|km|abbr=on}} north of the centre, opened in 1919 as a flight school.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081114102611/http://www.charleroi-airport.com/doc.php?nd=115&tid=15&site=1&lg=2&deploy=1 How it all started]. Charleroi-airport.com</ref> Later, it housed the [[Avions Fairey|Fairey]] aircraft-factory building.<ref>[http://www.baha.be/Webpages/Navigator/Belgian_Aviation_History/Industry/Sonaca.htm Avions Fairey Gosselies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620005139/http://www.baha.be/Webpages/Navigator/Belgian_Aviation_History/Industry/Sonaca.htm |date=2010-06-20 }}. Baha.be. Retrieved on 21 December 2012.</ref>

Gosselies is now used as an alternate airport for [[Brussels]]. Low-cost carrier [[Ryanair]] is the largest airline to provide service there; others include [[Wizz Air]], [[Jetairfly]].  Seasonal holiday charters also use the airport.

A new terminal opened in January 2008,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Brussels South Charleroi Airport|url=http://www.charleroi-airport.com/doc.php|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120629052642/http://www.charleroi-airport.com/doc.php?nd=162&tid=62&docid=357&lg=2&page=5&site=1|archive-date=29 June 2012|access-date=7 February 2008}}</ref> replacing a much smaller building which had exceeded capacity.

[[Brussels]] is {{convert|47|km|abbr=on}} north of Charleroi Airport.

In October 2021, the 650m extension of the runway was officially opened, bringing it to a total length of 3200m.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Orban |first=André |date=2021-10-08 |title=The runway extension of Brussels South Charleroi Airport is inaugurated, paving the way for long-haul flights |url=https://www.aviation24.be/airports/brussels-south-charleroi-crl/the-runway-extension-of-brussels-south-charleroi-airport-is-inaugurated-paving-the-way-for-long-haul-flights/ |access-date=2022-07-28 |website=Aviation24.be |language=en-GB}}</ref>

===Rail===
Charleroi is connected by train to other Belgian major cities through the main [[Charleroi-Central railway station]]. The city also has a secondary railway station, [[Charleroi-West railway station|Charleroi-West]],<ref name="Belgium & Luxembourg"/> on the Charleroi-to-[[Ottignies]] line.

===River transport===
The Port autonome de Charleroi gives access through the Belgian, Dutch and French canal and river network to three major ports (Dunkirk, Antwerp and Rotterdam). Il is composed of twenty-nine ports in the region of Charleroi distributed along the [[river Sambre]] and the [[Brussels-Charleroi canal]]. It has 8&nbsp;km of embankments, 5 million tons of goods transported each year, 10.000 containers and a trimodal platform for the containers;
100 companies have a concession and there are 1700 direct and 1000 indirect jobs associated.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=25 May 2023|title=Les sites portuaires|url=https://www.portcharleroi.be/fr/sites|website=Port autonome de Charleroi}}<!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --></ref>

Public transport is provided by [[Société Régionale Wallonne du Transport|TEC]] (Transport En Commun), the [[Walloons|Walloon]] public transport service. The greater Charleroi region is served by bus lines and a [[light-rail]] [[semi-metro]] system,<ref name="LRTA">{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=W. J. K. |last2=Thompson |first2=K.

Part of the latter is famous for incorporating one of the few remnants of the [[Vicinal tramway|Vicinal]], the former Belgian national tramway network.
Charleroi also has a planned four-line S-bahn type suburban rail system, the {{interlanguage link|Réseau express régional de Charleroi|fr}} (Réseau S).

====Charleroi light rail system====
The ''[[Métro Léger de Charleroi]]'' is equally famous for the parts of the system which were never built, partially built or fully completed but not opened. It was planned in the 1960s as a 48&nbsp;km (30&nbsp;mi.) light-rail network, operating partly on [[rapid transit]]/metro infrastructure, consisting of eight branch lines radiating from a central loop downtown.<ref>{{cite web|title=Urbanrail.net|url=http://www.urbanrail.net/eu/cha/charleroi-planned-network.gif|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410071629/http://www.urbanrail.net/eu/cha/charleroi-planned-network.gif|archive-date=10 April 2010|access-date=7 August 2016|format=GIF}}</ref> However, only one line (to Petria), part of another line (to Gilly) and three-quarters of the loop were actually built and opened to traffic, all from 1976 to 1996. Another branch line toward the suburb of Châtelet (Châtelineau) was almost fully built, to the extent of installing power cables, escalators and still-working electric signals in the first three stations<ref>{{cite web|title=Diggelfjoer: Abandoned|url=http://diggelfjoer.swalker.nl/index.php?main=aband&sub=abandcharl&page=abandcharl2|access-date=7 August 2016|website=Diggelfjoer.swalker.nl}}</ref> but was never opened as passenger numbers would be too low to economically justify the extra staff. The high costs of construction, a decline in Charleroi's traditional "smokestack" industries and questioning of the scope of the whole project in proportion to the actual demand for it are cited as reasons for the original plan's becoming unfulfilled.

The central loop and the Gilly branch as far as Soleilmont were completed in 2012, with funds from the [[European Investment Bank]].<ref>{{cite web|title=EIB loan for Charleroi light metro|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/eib-loan-for-charleroi-light-metro.html|access-date=7 August 2016|publisher=[[Railway Gazette International]]|archive-date=23 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823025545/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/eib-loan-for-charleroi-light-metro.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Gosselies branch opened as a street-level tramline in 2013.<ref>[http://www.urbanrail.net/eu/be/char/charleroi.htm > Europe > Belgium > Charleroi Prémétro (Belgium)].
