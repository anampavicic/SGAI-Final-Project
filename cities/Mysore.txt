Most of the city's development during modern times could be attributed to the [[Maharaja of Mysore|maharajas of Mysore]] and the [[Wadiyar dynasty]], who were patrons of art and culture. [[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]], when they were briefly in power in succession, also contributed significantly to the economic growth of the city and the kingdom by planting [[Morus (plant)|mulberry]] trees and [[silk]] in the region, and fighting [[Anglo-Mysore Wars|four wars]] against the [[British Empire|British]]. In present days, the [[Mysore City Corporation]] is responsible for the civic administration of the city.

During the [[Vijayadashami|Dasara]] festivals, Mysore receives hundreds of thousands of tourists from around the world. The city is also the namesake to various art forms and culture, such as [[Mysore Dasara]] and [[Mysore painting]]; foods such as the sweet delicacy [[Mysore pak]], breakfasts like Mysore Dosa and Mysore Masala Dosa; brands such as [[Mysore Sandal Soap]], [[Mysore Paints and Varnish Limited|Mysore Paints]]; and styles and cosmetics such as [[Mysore peta]], a traditional silk turban, and the [[Mysore silk]] [[sari]]s. Mysore is also known for [[betel leaves]] and its own special variety of [[Jasmine in Karnataka|jasmine]] flower fondly referred to as "Mysore mallige". [[Tourism]] is a lifeline industry for the city alongside the traditional industries. Mysore's intracity public transportation includes bus and intercity public transportation includes rail, bus, and air.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://starofmysore.com/flight-operations-resume-mysore-airport/amp/|title=Flight operations resume from Mysore Airport – Star of Mysore|date=21 September 2017|work=Star of Mysore|access-date=8 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914094303/https://starofmysore.com/flight-operations-resume-mysore-airport/amp/|archive-date=14 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Mysore'' is an anglicised form of ''Mahiṣūru'',<ref name="orig" /> which means "the abode of ''Mahiṣa''" in the vernacular [[Kannada]]. The common noun ''Mahiṣa,'' in Sanskrit, means buffalo; in this context, however, ''Mahiṣa'' refers to [[Mahishasura]], a mythical demon who could assume the form of either a human or a buffalo, and who, according to [[Hindu mythology]], ruled the ancient parts of Mysore Kingdom, known in Sanskrit as ''Mahiṣaka'', centred at ''Mahiṣapura''.<ref name="orig">{{cite news|url=http://archive.deccanherald.com/Deccanherald/Nov32006/sesame1148592006112.asp|last=Vasudeva|first=Rashmi|title=Land of milk and honey|newspaper=Deccan Herald|date=3 November 2006|access-date=12 November 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319162402/http://archive.deccanherald.com/Deccanherald/Nov32006/sesame1148592006112.asp|archive-date=19 March 2014}}</ref> He was killed by the goddess [[Chamunda|Chamundeshwari]], whose temple is situated atop the [[Chamundi Hills]], after whom it is named.
