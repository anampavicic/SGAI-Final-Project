Jiangsu has a coastline of over {{convert|1000|km|sp=us}} along the [[Yellow Sea]], and the [[Yangtze River]] passes through the southern part of the province.

Since the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties, Jiangsu has been a national economic and commercial center, partly due to the construction of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]]. Cities such as [[Nanjing]], [[Suzhou]], [[Wuxi]], [[Changzhou]], and [[Shanghai]] (separated from Jiangsu in 1927) are all major Chinese economic hubs. Since the initiation of economic reforms in 1990, Jiangsu has become a focal point for economic development. It is widely regarded as one of China's most developed provinces, when measured by its [[List of administrative divisions of Greater China by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]] (HDI).<ref name="SHDI"/> Its 2021 [[nominal GDP]] per capita reached RMB 137,300 (US$21,287), becoming the first province in China to reach the $20,000 mark.

Jiangsu is home to many of the world's leading exporters of electronic equipment, chemicals and textiles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2010/12/08/china-regions-to-be-bigger-than-russia/|title=China provinces 'to be bigger than Russia'|work=FT.com|access-date=22 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406140246/http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2010/12/08/china-regions-to-be-bigger-than-russia/|archive-date=6 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> It has also been China's largest recipient of foreign direct investment since 2006.

==Name==
Jiangsu's name is a compound of the first elements of the names of the two cities of Jiangning (now [[Nanjing]]) and [[Suzhou]]. The abbreviation for this province is "{{linktext|lang=zh-hans|苏}}" ({{transliteration|zh|Sū}}), the second character of its name.<ref>{{in lang|zh}} [http://www.people.com.cn/GB/shenghuo/1090/2435218.html Origin of the Names of China's Provinces] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427100058/http://www.people.com.cn/GB/shenghuo/1090/2435218.html |date=2016-04-27}}, [[People's Daily Online]]. {{in lang|zh}}</ref>

==History==
During the earliest Chinese dynasties, the area that is now Jiangsu was far away from the center of Chinese civilization, which was in the northwest [[Henan]]; it was home of the Huai barbarians ({{lang|zh|淮夷}}), an ancient ethnic group. During the [[Zhou dynasty]] more contact was made, and eventually the [[state of Wu]] appeared in southern Jiangsu, one of the many hundreds of states that existed across northern and central China at that time. Near the end of the [[Spring and Autumn period]], Wu became a great power under [[King Helu of Wu]], and defeated in 484&nbsp;BC the [[state of Qi]], a major power in the north in modern-day [[Shandong]] [[province]], and contest for the position of overlord over all states of China. The state of Wu was subjugated in 473&nbsp;BC by the [[state of Yue]], another state that had emerged to the south in modern-day [[Zhejiang]] province. Yue was in turn subjugated by the powerful [[state of Chu]] from the west in 333 BC. Eventually the [[state of Qin]] swept away all the other states, and unified China in 221 BC.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/317225/Jiangsu/71208/Cultural-life |title=Jiangsu - province, China |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |access-date=22 January 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514011237/https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/317225/Jiangsu/71208/Cultural-life/ |archive-date=14 May 2014}}</ref>

Under the reign of the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC to 220 AD), Jiangsu was removed from the centers of civilization in the [[North China Plain]], and was administered under two ''[[zhou (political division)|zhou]]'' (provinces): [[Xuzhou (ancient China)|Xu]] Province in the north, and [[Yangzhou (ancient China)|Yang]] Province in the south. During the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, southern Jiangsu became the base of the [[Eastern Wu]] (222 to 280), whose capital, [[Jiankang|Jianye]] (later renamed to Jiankang), is modern [[Nanjing]]. When nomadic invasions overran northern China in the 4th century, the imperial court of the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] moved to Jiankang. Cities in southern and central Jiangsu swelled with the influx of migrants from the north. Jiankang remained as the capital for four successive [[Southern dynasties]] and became the largest commercial and cultural center in China.<ref>{{cite web |language=zh-hans |url=http://dfz.nanjing.gov.cn/17557/17560/200906/t20090624_984387.html |script-title=zh:管玉春, 六代繁华帝王都 东晋、南朝的都城——建康 |date=2009-06-24 |access-date=2015-01-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104202205/http://dfz.nanjing.gov.cn/17557/17560/200906/t20090624_984387.html |archive-date=2015-01-04 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:Tiger hill.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Huqiu Tower]] of [[Tiger Hill, Suzhou|Tiger Hill]], Suzhou, built in 961.]]

After the Sui dynasty united the country in 581, the political center of the country shifted back to the north, but the Grand Canal was built through Jiangsu to link the Central Plains with the prosperous Yangtze Delta. The [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) relied on southern Jiangsu for annual deliveries of grain. It was during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), which saw the development of a wealthy mercantile class and emergent [[market economy]] in China, that [[Jiangnan]] (southern Jiangsu, [[Shanghai]], and adjacent areas) emerged as a center of [[trade]]. From then onwards, major cities like [[Suzhou]] or [[Yangzhou]], would be synonymous with opulence and luxury in China. Today the region remains one of the richest parts of China.

The Jurchen [[Jin dynasty, 1115–1234|Jin dynasty]] [[Jingkang Incident|gained control]] of [[North China]] in 1127 during the [[Jin campaigns against the Song dynasty|Jin-Song wars]], and [[Huai River]], which used to cut through north Jiangsu to reach the [[Yellow Sea]], was the border between the north, under the Jin, and the south, under the [[Southern Song dynasty]]. The Mongols took control of China in the thirteenth century. The [[Ming dynasty]], which was established in 1368 after driving out the [[Mongols]] who had occupied China, initially put its capital in [[Nanjing]]. Regions surrounding Nanjing, corresponding to Jiangsu and Anhui today, were designated as the Nanzhili province (literally "southern directly governed"). Following a coup by Zhu Di (later, the [[Yongle Emperor]]), however, the capital was moved to [[Beijing]], far to the north, although Nanjing kept its status as the southern capital. In late Ming, Jiangnan continued to be an important center of trade in China; some historians see in the flourishing [[textiles]] industry at the time incipient [[industrialization]] and [[capitalism]], a trend that was however aborted.

[[File:SuzhouNorthTemplePagoda.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Beisi Pagoda]] of [[Suzhou]], built between 1131 and 1162 during the [[Song dynasty]], {{convert|76|m|abbr=on}} tall.]]

The [[Qing dynasty]] converted Nanzhili to "Jiangnan province"; in 1666 Jiangsu and Anhui were split apart as separate provinces. Jiangsu's borders have been for the most part stable since then.

With the start of Western incursion into China in the 1840s, the rich and mercantile [[Yangtze river delta]] was increasingly exposed to Western influence; [[Shanghai]], originally an unremarkable little town of Jiangsu, quickly developed into a metropolis of trade, banking, and cosmopolitanism, and was split out later as an independent municipality. Jiangnan also figures strongly in the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1851{{spaced ndash}}1864), a massive and deadly rebellion that attempted to set up a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theocracy]] in China; it started far to the south, in [[Guangdong]] province, swept through much of South China, and by 1853, had established Nanjing as its capital, renamed as Tianjing ({{lang|zh|天京}} "Heavenly Capital").

The [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] was established in 1912,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.cultural-china.com/en/183History6971.html|title=Republic of China (1912 AD－1949 AD) - China culture|work=cultural-china.com|access-date=22 January 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018062336/http://history.cultural-china.com/en/183History6971.html|archive-date=18 October 2016}}</ref> and China was soon torn apart by warlords. Jiangsu changed hands several times, but in April 1927, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] established a government at [[Nanjing]]; he was soon able to bring most of China under his control. This was however interrupted by the [[second Sino-Japanese War]], which began full-scale in 1937; on December 13, 1937, Nanjing fell, and the combined atrocities of the occupying Japanese for the next three months would come to be known as the [[Rape of Nanjing]], after which it became the seat of the [[Wang Jingwei regime|collaborationist government of East China]] under [[Wang Jingwei]], and most of Jiangsu remained under Japanese occupation until the end of the war in 1945.

After the war, Nanjing was once again the capital of the Republic of China, though now the [[Chinese Civil War]] had broken out between the [[Kuomintang]] government and [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist forces]], based further north, mostly in [[Northeast China]]. The decisive [[Huaihai Campaign]] was fought in northern Jiangsu; it resulted in Kuomintang defeat, and the communists were soon able to cross the [[Yangtze River]] and take Nanjing. The Kuomintang fled southward and eventually ended up in [[Taipei]], from which the Republic of China government continues to administer [[Taiwan]], [[Penghu|Pescadores]], and its neighboring islands, though it also continues to claim (technically, at least) Nanjing as its rightful ''de jure'' capital.

After the communist takeover, [[Beijing]] (formerly Peiping) was made capital of the People's Republic, and Nanjing was demoted to be the provincial capital of Jiangsu. The [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms]] of [[Deng Xiaoping]] initially focused on the south coast of China, in [[Guangdong]] province, which soon left Jiangsu behind; starting from the 1990s they were applied more evenly to the rest of China. [[Suzhou]] and [[Wuxi]], two southern cities of Jiangsu in close proximity to neighboring [[Shanghai]], have since become particularly prosperous, being among the top 10 cities in China in terms of [[gross domestic product]] and outstripping the provincial capital of Nanjing. The income disparity between northern and southern Jiangsu however remains large.

Large lakes in Jiangsu include [[Lake Tai]] (the largest), [[Lake Hongze]], [[Lake Gaoyou]], [[Lake Luoma]], and [[Lake Yangcheng]].

Before 1194 A.D., the [[Huai River]] cut through north Jiangsu to reach the [[Yellow Sea]]. The Huai River is a major river in central China, and it was the traditional border between [[North China and South China]]. Since 1194 A.D., the [[Yellow River]] further to the north changed its course several times, running into the [[Huai River]] in north Jiangsu each time instead of its other usual path northwards into [[Bohai Bay]]. The silting caused by the [[Yellow River]] was so heavy that after its last episode of "hijacking" the Huai River ended in 1855: the Huai River was no longer able to go through its usual path into the sea. Instead it flooded, pooled up (thereby forming and enlarging [[Lake Hongze]] and [[Lake Gaoyou]]), and flowed southwards through the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] into the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]]. The old path of the [[Huai River]] is now marked by a series of [[irrigation]] channels, the most significant of which is the [[North Jiangsu Main Irrigation Canal]] ({{zh|t=蘇北灌溉總渠|s=苏北灌溉总渠|first=t}}), which channels a small amount of the water of the [[Huai River]] alongside south of its old path into the sea.

Most of Jiangsu has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'' or ''Cwa'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]), beginning to transition into a [[humid continental climate]] (Köppen ''Dwa'') in the far north. Seasonal changes are clear-cut, with temperatures at an average of {{convert|−1|to|4|C|F}} in January and {{convert|26|to|29|C|F}} in July. Rain falls frequently between spring and summer (''[[meiyu]]''), [[typhoon]]s with [[rainstorm]]s occur in late summer and early autumn. As with the rest of the coast, tornados are possible. The annual average rainfall is {{convert|800|to|1200|mm|sp=us}}, concentrated mostly in summer during the southeast [[monsoon]].

=== Climate change in Jiangsu ===
Due to its flat terrain, low altitude, and dense population, Jiangsu is one of the most vulnerable regions in China to [[Climate change in China|climate change]] and its ensuing [[sea level rise]].<ref name=":03">{{Cite web |title=XDI releases world-first comparison of every state's physical climate risk |url=https://www.preventionweb.net/news/xdi-releases-world-first-comparison-every-states-physical-climate-risk |access-date=2023-03-16 |website=www.preventionweb.net |date=February 20, 2023 |language=en}}</ref> According to the data collected by the Center of Climate Change in Jiangsu from 1961 to 2007, on average, the province experiences an temperature increase between 0.16 and 0.45 Celsius per 10 years and total precipitation change between -28.7 and 37.09&nbsp;mm per 10 years. [[Extreme weather]] have become stronger and more common. Jiangsu's [[Effects of climate change on agriculture|agriculture]], [[ecosystem]], [[Water resources|water resource]], transportation, and [[Coastal erosion|coastline]] are all negatively impacted. The speed of sea level rise exceeds the world's average by a large margin.<ref>{{Cite web |last=苏 |first=政发 |date=2009 |title=江苏省政府关于印发江苏省应对气候变化方案的通知 |url=https://www.ccchina.org.cn/Detail.aspx?newsId=73146&TId=266 |website=中国气候变化信息网}}</ref>

Specifically, a ranking on climate change risk of global regions released in early 2023 by [[The Cross Dependency Initiative]] (XDI) puts Jiangsu as the most vulnerable of the entire world.<ref name=":03" /> Jiangsu is at more risk due to its extensive [[Built environment|industrial, trade, residential, and commercial development]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=XDI Benchmark Series - Gross Domestic Climate Risk |url=https://xdi.systems/xdi-benchmark-gdcr/ |access-date=2023-03-16 |website=XDI |language=en-AU}}</ref>

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Jiangsu|List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China}}

The politics of Jiangsu is structured in a one party (Communist) government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.

The [[Governor of Jiangsu]] is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Jiangsu. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Jiangsu [[Chinese Communist Party]] Provincial Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the "Jiangsu [[Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary|CCP Party Chief]]".

=== Courts ===
In July 2021, the Jiangsu Intermediate Court established a labor tribunal to handle [[Labor relations in China|labor]] disputes arising from the [[platform economy]].<ref name=":Zhang">{{Cite book |last=Zhang |first=Angela Huyue |title=High Wire: How China Regulates Big Tech and Governs Its Economy |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2024 |isbn=9780197682258}}</ref>{{Rp|page=183}}

==Economy==
[[File:Ganjiaxiang - industrial panorama - P1070643.JPG|thumb|An industrial landscape in Ganjiaxiang, [[Qixia District]], Nanjing]]

As of 2022, Jiangsu had a gross domestic product (GDP) of [[Renminbi|CNY¥]]12.29 trillion (US$1.83 trillion),<ref name="data2022" /> the [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP|second-highest]] in China after Guangdong.

Jiangsu is very wealthy among the provinces of China. Its 2022 [[nominal GDP]] per capita reached ¥144,390 (US$21,467), becoming the first province in China to reach the $20,000 mark.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |date=2022-02-07 |title=Decoding China's 2021 GDP Growth Rate: A Look at Regional Numbers |url=https://www.china-briefing.com/news/chinas-2021-gdp-performance-a-look-at-major-provinces-and-cities/ |access-date=2022-09-13 |website=China Briefing News |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":5" /> Cities like Nanjing, [[Suzhou]], and [[Wuxi]] have GDPs per capita around twice the provincial average, making south Jiangsu one of the most prosperous regions in China.

The province has an extensive irrigation system supporting its agriculture, which is based primarily on [[rice]] and [[wheat]], followed by [[maize]] and [[sorghum]]. Main [[cash crop]]s include [[cotton]], [[soybean]]s, [[peanut]]s, [[rapeseed]], [[sesame]], [[hemp|ambary hemp]], and [[tea]]. Other products include [[peppermint]], [[spearmint]], [[bamboo]], [[medicinal herbs]], [[apple]]s, [[pear]]s, [[peach]]es, [[loquat]]s, [[ginkgo]]. [[Silkworm]]s form an important part of Jiangsu's agriculture, with the [[Lake Tai]] region to the south a major base of [[silk]] production in China. Jiangsu is an important producer of freshwater fish and other aquatic products.

Jiangsu has [[coal]], [[petroleum]], and [[natural gas]] deposits, but its most significant mineral products are non-metal minerals such as [[halite]] (rock salt), [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], and [[marble]]. The city of Xuzhou is a coal hub of China. The salt mines of [[Huaiyin District, Huai'an|Huaiyin]] have more than 0.4 trillion [[tonne]]s of deposits, one of the greatest collections of deposits in China.

Jiangsu is historically oriented toward light industries such as [[textiles]] and [[food industry]]. Since 1949, Jiangsu has developed heavy industries such as [[chemical industry]] and [[construction material]]s. Jiangsu's important industries include machinery, electronic, chemicals, and automobile.<ref name="thechinaperspective1">{{cite web |url=http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/jiangsu-province/ |title=Jiangsu Province: Economic News and Statistics for Jiangsu's Economy |publisher=Thechinaperspective.com |access-date=2013-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511201549/http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/jiangsu-province/ |archive-date=2013-05-11 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/data/province/jiangsu.html |title=Country Profile:Jiangsu province -People's Daily Online |publisher=English.peopledaily.com.cn |access-date=2013-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527231804/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/data/province/jiangsu.html |archive-date=2013-05-27 |url-status=live}}</ref> The government has worked hard to promote the solar industry and hoped by 2012 the solar industry would be worth 100 billion RMB.<ref>[The China Perspective http://thechinaperspective.com/articles/jiangsusettoreacha100bphotovoltaicindustry6597/index.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119050017/http://thechinaperspective.com/articles/jiangsusettoreacha100bphotovoltaicindustry6597/index.html |date=2009-11-19}}]</ref> Jiangsu's economy growth has directly benefited from the reform Chinese's policies, and its growth trajectory reflects that of many other coastal provinces, such as Zhejiang and Shandong.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Wei|first1=Yehua Dennis|last2=Fan|first2=C.

==Transportation==
Jiangsu is home to one of the most extensive transportation networks in China.

===Air===
[[Nanjing Lukou International Airport]] {{airport codes|NKG}} serves as the major airport in the province, with flights to Tokyo, Osaka, Hong Kong, Seoul-Incheon, Frankfurt, Bangkok, Milan, Vancouver and Los Angeles. Other passenger airports include [[Sunan Shuofang International Airport]], [[Changzhou Benniu Airport]], [[Yangzhou Taizhou International Airport]], and [[Nantong Xingdong Airport]]. Air traffic in the populated [[Suzhou]] area is often diverted to [[Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport]], to which Suzhou is conveniently connected to via bus services and by expressway.

[[Xuzhou Guanyin International Airport]], [[Yancheng Nanyang International Airport]], and [[Lianyungang Baitabu Airport]] serve as hubs in northern Jiangsu.

===Rail===
{{Main|Railways in Jiangsu}}

The southern part of the province, namely the Shanghai-Nanjing corridor, has very high-frequency rail services. Jiangsu is on the [[Jinghu railway]] from [[Beijing]] to [[Shanghai]], as well as the high speed line between the two cities: [[Shanghai–Nanjing intercity railway]] and [[Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway]], completed in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Since the completion of the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed line, travel time between Beijing and Nanjing has been reduced to approximately four hours (from eleven hours previously); travel time between Nanjing and Shanghai on the fastest high-speed trains takes just over an hour.

As of 2022, all major cities in Jiangsu have been connected by high-speed lines, including: [[Shanghai-Nanjing intercity railway]] since 2010, [[Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway]] since 2011, [[Nanjing–Hangzhou high-speed railway]] since 2013, [[Nanjing–Anqing intercity railway]] since 2015, [[Lianyungang–Zhenjiang high-speed railway]] since 2020, [[Xuzhou–Yancheng high-speed railway]] since 2019, [[Yancheng–Nantong high-speed railway]] since 2020, [[Shanghai–Suzhou–Nantong railway]] since 2020, and [[Lianyungang–Xuzhou high-speed railway]] since 2021.

===Road===
Jiangsu's road network is one of the most developed in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.coicjs.org/News/Detail2-113.aspx|title=Jiangsu Chamber of International Commerce|work=coicjs.org|access-date=22 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417141641/http://en.coicjs.org/News/Detail2-113.aspx|archive-date=17 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[G2 Beijing–Shanghai Expressway|Beijing–Shanghai Expressway (G2)]] enters the province from the north and passes through Huai'an, Yangzhou, Taizhou, and Wuxi on the way to Shanghai; travelling from Shanghai westbound, the G2 forks at [[Wuxi]] and continues onto Nanjing separately as G42, the [[Shanghai–Nanjing Expressway]], which serves the widely travelled southern corridor of the province. The [[Ningchang Expressway]] links Nanjing with [[Changzhou]]. The [[Suzhou]] area is extensively networked with expressways, going in all directions. The [[Yanhai Expressway]] links the coastal regions of the province, passing through [[Nantong]], [[Yancheng]], and [[Lianyungang]].

Historically, the province was divided by the Yangtze River into northern and southern regions. The first bridge across the river in Jiangsu, the [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]], was completed in 1968 during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The second bridge crossing, [[Jiangyin Suspension Bridge|Jiangyin Bridge]], opened 30 years later at [[Jiangyin]]. As of October 2014, there were 11 [[Yangtze River bridges and tunnels|cross-Yangtze bridges]] in the province, including the five in Nanjing, which also has two cross-river tunnels. The Jiangyin Bridge ({{convert|1385|m|ft|abbr=on}}), [[Runyang Bridge]] (opened in 2005, connecting Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, {{convert|1490|m|ft|abbr=on}}), and [[Fourth Nanjing Yangtze Bridge|Fourth Nanjing Bridge]] (opened in 2012; {{convert|1418|m|ft|abbr=on}}) all rank among the ten [[List of longest suspension bridge spans|longest suspension bridges]] in the world. The [[Sutong Bridge]], opened in 2008, connecting Nantong and Changshu, has one of the [[List of longest cable-stayed bridge spans|longest]] [[cable-stayed bridge]] spans in the world, at {{convert|1088|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

===Metro (subway)===
As of December 2022, Jiangsu has six cities that have operational subway systems, together with an extra city ([[Huai'an]]) currently under construction. These six cities are [[Nanjing]], [[Suzhou]], [[Wuxi]], [[Changzhou]], [[Xuzhou]] and [[Nantong]].

The [[Nanjing Metro]] was opened in September 2005. It was the sixth city in mainland China that opened up a metro system.

==Culture==
The four mass migrations in the 4th, 8th, 12th and 14th centuries had been influential in shaping the regional culture of Jiangsu. According to dialects and the other factors, the province can be roughly segmented four major cultural subdivisions: [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] ({{lang|zh-hans|吴}}), Jinling ({{lang|zh|金陵}}), [[Sinitic languages#Huai|Huaiyang]] ({{lang|zh-hans|淮扬}}) and [[Sinitic languages#Central Plains and Lanyin Mandarin|Xuhuai]] ({{lang|zh|徐淮}}), from southeast to northwest.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} The belts of transition blurred the boundaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jssdfz.jiangsu.gov.cn/col/col59258/index.html|script-title=zh:江苏省地方志 文化|website=jssdfz.jiangsu.gov.cn|access-date=2017-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231212358/http://jssdfz.jiangsu.gov.cn/col/col59258/index.html|archive-date=2017-12-31|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title="Jiangsu Provincial Geography" (in Chinese)|publisher=Beijing Normal University Publishing Group|year=2011|isbn=9787303131686|location=Beijing}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://xcb.huaian.gov.cn/xcbdwjs/zcfg/content/75812.html|script-title=zh:江苏省2001-2010年文化大省建设规划纲要 淮安宣传网-中共淮安市委宣传部主办|publisher=Huai'an People's Government|website=xcb.huaian.gov.cn|access-date=2017-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231212148/http://xcb.huaian.gov.cn/xcbdwjs/zcfg/content/75812.html|archive-date=2017-12-31|url-status=live}}</ref>

Jiangsu is rich in cultural traditions. ''[[Kunqu]]'', originating in [[Kunshan]], is one of the most renowned and prestigious forms of [[Chinese opera]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.china-art-collection.com/en/discover-asia/geography/jiangsu.htm|title=China Collection: Online Gallery - Discover Asia - Geography, Provinces, 4|last=Luxembourg|first=China Collection -|website=www.china-art-collection.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228100721/http://www.china-art-collection.com/en/discover-asia/geography/jiangsu.htm|archive-date=2018-02-28|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} ''[[Pingtan (artform)|Pingtan]]'', a form of storytelling accompanied by music, is also popular: it can be subdivided into types by origin: [[Suzhou Pingtan]] (of [[Suzhou]]), [[Yangzhou Pingtan]] (of [[Yangzhou]]), and [[Nanjing Pingtan]] (of [[Nanjing]]). [[Wuxi opera]], a form of traditional [[Chinese opera]], is popular in [[Wuxi]], while [[Huaiju]] is popular further north, around [[Yancheng]]. [[Jiangsu cuisine]] is one of the eight great traditions of the [[cuisine of China]].

[[Suzhou]] is also well known for its silk, [[Chinese embroidery]], [[jasmine tea]], stone bridges, [[pagodas]], and classical gardens. Nearby [[Yixing]] is noted for its [[teaware]] while Yangzhou is known for its [[lacquerware]] and [[jadeware]]. [[Nanjing]]'s ''[[yunjin]]'' is a noted type of woven silk.

Since ancient times, south Jiangsu has been famed for its prosperity and opulence, and simply inserting south Jiangsu place names (Suzhou, Yangzhou, etc.) into poetry gave an effect of dreaminess,{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} as was indeed done by many famous poets. In particular, the fame of Suzhou (as well as [[Hangzhou]] in neighbouring [[Zhejiang]]) has led to the popular saying: {{lang|zh-hant|上有天堂，下有蘇杭}} ("above there is heaven; below there are Suzhou and [[Hangzhou]]"), a saying that continues to be a source of pride for the people of these two still prosperous cities. Similarly, the prosperity of Yangzhou has led poets to dream of: {{lang|zh-hant|腰纏十萬貫，騎鶴下揚州}} ("with a hundred thousand [[Ancient Chinese currency|strings of coins]] wrapped around its waist, a [[crane (bird)|crane]] landed in Yangzhou").
