==Etymology==
The name ''Puerto Princesa'' has several possible origins. It is said to have been attributed by locals to a princess-like maiden who roams the place on certain nights of the year, while other accounts attribute its geographical advantage as a seaport which is a naturally protected area due to its surrounding mountains, and is characterized by a depth able to accommodate any size of shipping vessel.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History {{!}} City Government of Puerto Princesa|url=http://puertoprincesa.ph/?q=about-our-city/history|access-date=September 12, 2020|website=puertoprincesa.ph}}</ref>

There are two official versions about the actual origin of the name. The first is that place was originally named Port of the Princess ([[spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Puerto de la Princesa'') after [[Infanta Eulalia of Spain|Infanta Eulalia]], one of the princesses born to [[Isabella II of Spain]] and her consort, [[Francisco de Asís, Duke of Cádiz|Francis, Duke of Cádiz]]<ref name="eulalia"/>{{efn|name=galliera|The reference also inaccurately states that Eulalia died young; in reality, she would eventually become the wife of the [[Infante Antonio, Duke of Galliera|Duke of Galliera]], and the longest-lived among the children of Isabella II and Francis, Duke of Cadiz, dying at the age of 94 in 1958.<ref>"Infanta Eulalia", ''The Times'' (10 March 1958): 12.</ref>}} Another version, however, states that the place was originally named Port Asuncion ([[spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Puerto de Asunción''), allegedly named after another daughter of Isabella II and the Duke of Cadiz. In this version, the princess suffered an untimely death, which prompted the Queen to change the name to ''Puerto de la Princesa'', and was eventually shortened to Puerto Princesa. However, this second version is likely to be incorrect, as Isabella and Francis did not have a daughter named Asunción.<ref name="mb">{{Cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-112026941.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025072333/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-112026941.html |title=Tourist city venue for PNRC event.(Tourism) |archive-date=October 25, 2012 |date=January 9, 2004 |access-date=August 11, 2024 |website=highbeam.com}}</ref> 

== History ==

=== Spanish period ===
[[File:Puertoprincesa chart4343 1904.jpeg|thumb|left|A 1904 map of Puerto Princesa]]

Spanish colonists founded the settlement on March 4, 1872, in the course of their exploration of the province. As they scanned the Palawan shoreline for a capital site, they came upon a hill with steep declivity. Rowing to shore, they surveyed the hill and discovered an extensive plateau which they decided as ideal for settlement.

Soon after, Fr. Antonio Muro levelled a portion of the hill to make way for a chapel (that section is now occupied by the [[Puerto Princesa Cathedral|Roman Catholic Cathedral]], the P.C. Barracks and the Rizal Park, the Old Municipal Building used to be there, as well as an Elementary School). The first mass celebrated in Puerto Princesa took place at a site where a marker now stands.

In May 1872, the [[Port of Puerto Princesa]] became the center of Spanish naval operations in the area because the Bay met all the navy's requirements. Royal decrees later provided incentives to settlers, and by 1883 the settlement had flourished into a town of twelve roads, a hospital and well-built port.

In 1894, Puerto Princesa was recognized by government authorities as one of the most beautiful towns in the country by virtue of the orderly distribution of streets, buildings and houses as well as the cleanliness of the community.<ref>https://puertoprincesa.ph/?q=about-our-city%2Fhistory {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2024}}</ref>

=== American period and World War II ===

{{Main|Invasion of Palawan|Palawan Massacre}}

In 1911, the New American Administration made Puerto Princesa the seat of the Palawan Provincial Government with Major John Brown as Lieutenant Governor.

In the year 1936, Governor Heginio Mendoza made a directive on the transfer of the Palawan High School (currently Palawan National School) from the island municipality of Cuyo to the central place of the province, which was the Municipality of Puerto Princesa.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://pns.smartschools.ph/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 14, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414113037/http://pns.smartschools.ph/ |archive-date=April 14, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

During the [[Pacific War|Pacific campaign]] of [[World War II]] and the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation]], the village was largely abandoned. On May 18, 1942, Japanese troops landed and occupied Puerto Princesa City.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rajahtravel.biz/ehome/palawanliberation2018/599543/|title=A Salute to Valor: Palawan Liberation}}</ref>
