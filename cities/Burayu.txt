'''Burayu''' ({{langx|om|Burraayyuu}}; {{langx|am|ቡራዩ}}) is a city and [[List_of_zones_of_Ethiopia#Oromia_Region|special census zone]] in the [[Oromia Region]] of [[Ethiopia]], located directly adjacent to the national capital city [[Addis Ababa]] (known as ''Finfinne'' in [[Oromo language|Oromo]]). With the rapid growth of the capital in recent decades and [[urban sprawl]], the town has faced considerable economic and demographic pressures. The city's population has grown from merely 10,000 people in 1994 to an estimated 130,000 people three decades later; consisting of migrants from the rural south of Ethiopia looking for work along with former residents of Addis Ababa who sought cheaper housing in the surburbs.<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url=https://www.ethiopia-insight.com/2018/09/26/mob-killings-split-ethiopians-as-political-fault-lines-test-abiys-big-tent/|title=Mob killings split Ethiopians as political fault lines test Abiy's big tent|first1=Nizar|last1=Manek|first2=Ermias|last2=Tasfaye|newspaper=Ethiopia Insight|date=26 September 2018}}</ref>
