'''Cluj County''' ({{IPA|ro|kluʒ|-|Ro-Cluj.ogg}}) is a county ({{lang|ro|[[județ]]}}) of [[Romania]], in [[Transylvania]]. Its seat is [[Cluj-Napoca]].

==Name==
In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] it is known as ''Kolozs megye''. Under the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], a county with an identical name ([[Kolozs County]], {{langx|ro|Comitatul Cluj}}) existed since the 11th century.

== Geography ==
{{Romanian counties map}}
Cluj County lies in the northwestern half of the country, between parallels 47°28' in north and 46°24' in south, meridians 23°39' in west and 24°13' in east, respectively. It covers an area of 6,674&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> unfolded in the contact zone of three representative natural units: [[Apuseni Mountains]], [[Transylvanian Plateau|Someș Plateau]] and [[Transylvanian Plain]]. Cluj County is the 12th largest in the country and occupies 2.8% of Romania's area. It is bordered to the northeast with [[Maramureș County|Maramureș]] and [[Bistrița-Năsăud County|Bistrița-Năsăud]] counties, to the east with [[Mureș County]], to the south with [[Alba County]], and to the west with [[Bihor County|Bihor]] and [[Sălaj County|Sălaj]] counties.

=== Relief ===
[[File:Cheile Turzii-(59).JPG|thumb|200px|[[Turda Gorge]]]]
[[File:Pietrele Albe.jpg|thumb|200px|Pietrele Albe, Vlădeasa Massif]]
The relief is rugged, constituted mostly of hilly units belonging to Someș Plateau and, to a lesser extent, of mountain portions that represent the northeastern part of Apuseni Mountains. Fields are missing on the territory of Cluj County, being replaced, as step of relief, by well-developed terraces and floodplains in the lower sectors of [[Someșul Mic]] and [[Arieş River (Mureş)|Arieș]] rivers. The hilly area, extended in the central northern and southern part of the county, include several subunits of Someș Plateau (Cluj, [[Feleacu]], Dej hills), among which are individualized numerous depressions ([[Apahida]], [[Bonțida]], [[Gilău, Cluj|Gilău]], [[Dej]], [[Turda]], [[Câmpia Turzii]]) at the edge of which there are some contact depressions ([[Huedin]] and [[Iara, Cluj|Iara]]), at the limit of the mountain. The mountain sector, located in southwest, belongs to Apuseni, mountains group of Western Carpathians, represented by sectors of Vlădeasa Massif (peak Vlădeasa – 1,836 m), Gilău Mountains and Muntele Mare, as well as narrow portions of [[Trascău Mountains|Trascău]], Plopiș, [[Meseș Mountains|Meseș]] and [[Bihor Mountains|Bihor]] mountains. In the eastern part of Cluj County, east of the river alignment Valea Florilor–Maraloiu–Someșul Mic, is located a part of the [[Transylvanian Plain|Hilly Plain of Transylvania]], a special unit of relief, with mountainous character, partially overlapped by some gas-condensate domes.

=== Hydrographic network ===
[[File:ClujNapocaSomeșul Mic.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Someșul Mic]] in [[Cluj-Napoca]]]]
The hydrographic network is represented by rivers (Someșul Mic with SW–NE direction, whose catchment area is fully developed on the territory of Cluj County, [[Crișul Repede]] and lower Arieș),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rowater.ro/dasomes/sgacluj/Continut%20Site/Acasa/Despre%20Noi.aspx |title=Cadrul natural |work=Cluj Water Management System |language=ro}}</ref> natural lakes and ponds (Cătina Popii I and II, [[Geaca]], [[Țaga]], etc.) and lakes of hydropower interest (Beliș-Fântânele, [[Lake Tarnița|Tarnița]] and Gilău). In the northeastern part of Cluj County, Someșul Mic joins [[Someșul Mare]], upstream of Dej, forming the [[Someș]], which flows into the [[Tisza]] to the west.

The deep waters are less represented and are characterized by high mineralization. Relatively rich mineral springs, with sulphates, calcium and sodium chloride, can be found in [[Dezmir]], [[Cojocna]], [[Jucu|Gădălin]], [[Sic, Cluj|Sic]], [[Gherla]], [[Leghia]], [[Someșeni]], [[Turda]], etc.<ref name="pref">{{cite web |url=http://www.prefecturacluj.ro/judetul-cluj/monografia-judetului-cluj/date-generale |title=Date generale |work=Cluj Prefecture |language=ro}}</ref>

Through its location, Cluj County benefits from a moderate [[continental climate]].<ref name="pref" /> In the mountain sector (Vlădeasa Massif and Muntele Mare), the mean annual air temperature is 2&nbsp;°C, and in the rest of the territory is 6&nbsp;°C. Annual thermal amplitudes have values between 17 and 19&nbsp;°C in the mountains and grow at 23–25&nbsp;°C in hilly areas, plateaus and plains.

Rainfall is distributed unevenly, with minimal amounts in Turda–Câmpia Turzii (about 550&nbsp;mm) and maximum in Vlădeasa Massif (about 1,400&nbsp;mm). On average, annual values of rainfall reach 600–650&nbsp;mm in the Transylvania Plain, 650–700&nbsp;mm in the Someș Plateau and over 900–1000&nbsp;mm in mountainous areas.<ref name="pref" />

=== Natural resources ===
[[File:Salina Turda - tunel de acces 12.jpg|thumb|200px|Access tunnel in [[Salina Turda|Turda salt mine]]. The geological reserve is estimated at 38,750 million tonnes of [[salt]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://salinaturda.eu/salina-turda/ |title=Salina Turda – Un adevărat muzeu al mineritului în sare din Transilvania |work=Salina Turda |language=ro}}</ref>]]
Cluj County has rich and varied natural resources. Iron ores came into use in 1962, by exploitations in [[Căpușu Mic]] and [[Băișoara]], being conducted over the years a series of geological explorations in [[Vlaha]], [[Săvădisla]] and [[Cacova Ierii]]. Fossil fuels are represented by [[brown coal]] exploited in Ticu–Dâncu–Băgara area and [[peat]], exploited in [[Călățele]]–Căpățâna sector. Likewise, there is a gas-condensed dome in [[Puini]] in the Transylvanian Plain.

Besides iron ore and mineral fuels, there is a variety of useful minerals and rocks,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zf.ro/suplimente/ce-bogatii-se-ascund-in-subsolurile-romaniei-vedeti-harta-resurselor-naturale-pe-judete-8969607 |title=Ce bogății se ascund în subsolurile României.

=== Vegetation ===
[[File:Stufărișurile de la Sic, judeţul Cluj.jpg|thumb|200px|Thickets of Sic]]
The vegetation is heterogeneous and storeyed due to the prevalence of hilly and mountainous relief. In Cluj County can be met a wide range of plant formations. Sub-alpine floor, present in Vlădeasa Massif and Muntele Mare, is characterized by lawns with midget grasses and [[juniper]] bushes. The [[spruce]] forests floor, expanded on mountain slopes between 1,000 and 1,600 m, consists predominantly of spruce mixed with [[fir]], and the [[deciduous forest]]s floor develops on all forms of relief, ranging from 400 to 1,000 m, and consists of [[sessility (botany)|sessile]] forests mixed with [[beech]], [[hornbeam]] or [[elm]]. On slopes with northern exposure of [[Luna River|Luna]] and [[Lujerdiu]] valleys develop compact clusters of sessile, hornbeam, [[Fraxinus|ash]] and elm forests. In the Hilly Plain of Transylvania appear islands of [[steppe]], alternating with patches of forests.

=== Fauna ===
The fauna is adapted to vegetation flooring, but less constant to its limits, due to great mobility; it is rich in species. In forests are present numerous animals of cynegetic interest, including [[deer]], [[stag]], [[bear]], [[fox]], [[lynx]], [[wild boar]], [[squirrel]], and on Someș Valley naturally entered the [[muskrat]]. Around artificial lakes live a series of birds ([[duck]], [[coot]], [[stork]]), in the Someș Plateau and Transylvanian Plain was colonized the [[pheasant]], and in [[Turda Gorge]] area lives the [[golden eagle|rock eagle]]. Mountain rivers are populated with [[trout]]s, [[Thymallus thymallus|graylings]] and [[common nase|nase]]s, and in the lower ones with [[barbel (fish)|barbel]] and [[chub]].

== Economy ==
Cluj has, after Bucharest, the largest number of companies in the country (over 32,000 firms in 2014) and ranks third after net average earning, with 1,890 lei in December 2013 (Bucharest has 2,474 lei, and Ilfov 2,138 lei);<ref name="zf">{{cite web |url=http://www.zf.ro/zf-24/cum-arata-economia-judetului-cluj-noua-fabrica-de-antreprenori-a-romaniei-judetul-unde-industria-nu-a-murit-dar-s-a-mutat-din-oras-in-parcurile-industriale-12660155 |title=Cum arată economia județului Cluj, noua "fabrică de antreprenori" a României, judeţul unde industria nu a murit, dar s-a mutat din oraș în parcurile industriale |work=Ziarul Financiar |last1=Ciriperu |first1=Dana |last2=Mihai |first2=Adelina |date=29 May 2014 |language=ro}}</ref> it is almost 5% higher than the national average. Great investors in the automotive industry, but also in IT have increased the average salary of employees, but these wage increases have led to an increase in the cost of living, reflected, for example, through higher rents than in surrounding counties. In Cluj companies work over 150,000 people, and after their turnover, the county ranks fifth in the Romanian business hierarchy, with €8 billion in 2012,<ref name="zf" /> after Bucharest (€81.9 billion), [[Ilfov County|Ilfov]] (€13.6 billion), [[Argeș County|Argeș]] (€9.1 billion) and [[Timiș County|Timiș]] (€8.7 billion). The number of registered unemployed at the end of June 2014 was 9,744 people, and the [[unemployment rate]], calculated on the working population, is 2.8%, being 0.6% lower than the unemployment rate in June 2013. In 2015, GDP per capita is +30% more than the national average.

Cluj County is the county with the most industrial parks in the country. Five such functional areas and another in preparation already attracted investment of over half a billion euros and led to the creation of over 5,000 jobs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Special/Raport+de+tara/Cluj/RAPORT+DE+TARA+Clujul+judetul+cu+cele+mai+multe+parcuri+industri |title=RAPORT DE ȚARĂ.

Historically, Cojocna County was located in the central-northwestern part of [[Greater Romania]], in the northwestern part of [[Transylvania]]. After reorganized and renamed to Cluj County, its territory included all of the current Cluj County, and some of the communes now in [[Sălaj County]] and [[Mureș County]]. It was bordered on the north by the counties of [[Sălaj County|Sălaj]], [[Someș County|Someș]], and [[Năsăud County|Năsăud]], on the west by [[Bihor County]], on the south by [[Turda County]], and to the east by [[Mureș County]].

===History===
The territory of the county was transferred in 1920 from the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], as successor state to [[Austria-Hungary]], to Romania by the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. Thus, Cluj County was the successor to the former Hungarian administrative unit of [[Kolozs County]] ({{langx|hu|Kolozs vármegye}}). Until the year 1925 it was called '''Cojocna County''' ({{langx|ro|Județul Cojocna}}). In Hungarian, the town of [[Cojocna]] is called "Kolozs", so it was a rough equivalent of the prior Hungarian name. Cojocna County's headquarters were in Cluj, but Cluj enjoyed the status of a free city. In 1925, the autonomous status of Cluj was abolished, and the free city was merged with the county of Cojocna, which was renamed Cluj County.

In 1938, [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol II]] promulgated a new [[1938 Constitution of Romania|Constitution]], and subsequently he had the administrative division of the Romanian territory changed. [[Former administrative divisions of Romania#Ținuturi: 1938 - 1940|10 ''ținuturi'']] (approximate translation: "lands") were created (by merging the counties) to be ruled by ''rezidenți regali'' (approximate translation: "Royal Residents") - appointed directly by the King - instead of the [[Prefect (Romania)|prefects]]. Cluj County became part of [[Ținutul Crișuri]].

In 1940, part of the county was transferred back to Hungary with the rest of [[Northern Transylvania]] under the [[Second Vienna Award]]. The parts of the county that remained under Romanian administration (the south of the county, including [[Feleacu, Cluj|Feleacu]]), were united with [[Turda County]] and became [[Cluj-Turda County]]. Beginning in 1944, Romanian forces with Soviet assistance recaptured the ceded territory and reintegrated it into Romania. Romanian jurisdiction over the entire county per the Treaty of Trianon was reaffirmed in the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947]]. The county was disestablished [[Regions of the People's Republic of Romania|by the communist government of Romania in 1950]], and re-established in 1968 when Romania restored the county administrative system.

===Administration===

As of 1925, the county had an area of 5,079&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and a population of 352,029 inhabitants, consisted of 226 rural communes (equivalent to today's villages), and one urban commune (the city of Cluj), and was administratively subdivided into twelve districts (''[[plasă|plăși]]''):<ref name=Minerva>''"Minerva. Enciclopedie Română"'' (Ed. Comitetului de Redacție al Enciclopediei Române Minerva, Cluj, 1929), pag. 316</ref>

The administration and territory of the county were reorganized in 1929, introducing municipalities, towns, communes and villages. The county' capital remained at Cluj (now Cluj-Napoca). The county had nine districts comprising one city (Cluj), one town [[Huedin]], and 232 villages divided into seven other districts:<ref name=Grigor_Pop>Grigor P. Pop - ''"Județul Cluj"'' (Ed.
