'''Nampo''' (North Korean official spelling: '''Nampho'''; {{IPA|ko|nam.pʰo|pron}}), also spelled '''Namp<noinclude>'</noinclude>o''', is a city in [[North Korea]] which is the country's [[List of cities in North Korea|fourth-largest by population]]. The city is an important seaport in the country as it lies on the northern shore of the [[Taedong River]], 15&nbsp;km east of the river's mouth. Formerly known as '''Chinnamp<noinclude>'</noinclude>o''', it was a provincial-level "Directly Governed City" ("Chikhalsi") from 1980 to 2004, and was designated a [[Special cities of North Korea|"Special City"]] ("T'ŭkpyŏlsi", 특별시; 特別市) in 2010. Nampo is approximately 50&nbsp;km southwest of Pyongyang, at the mouth of the [[Taedong River]]. Since North Korean independence, the city has developed a wide range of industry and has seen significant recent redevelopment.

== History ==

=== Before formation of North Korea ===
The city belonged to [[Gojoseon]] until the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms era]], when it was taken by [[Goguryeo]]. During this time, the city was part of Sogyong (now [[Pyongyang]]) until the [[Goryeo]] dynasty, when in the aftermath of the [[Myocheong|Myocheong rebellion]], Sogyong was split into six counties, of which currently constitute Nampo are Kangso-hyon, Ryonggang-hyon and Samhwa-hyon.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=북한지역정보넷|trans-title=Nampo - overview|url=http://www.cybernk.net/infoText/InfoAdminstList.aspx?ac=A0228&mc=AD0101&direct=1|access-date=2021-10-12|website=www.cybernk.net}}</ref> In the late Goryeo period, the area was named Chungnampo for the village of Pogu, located to the south of [[Chungsan County]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=북한지역정보넷|trans-title=Old place name|url=http://www.cybernk.net/infoText/InfoAdminstDetail.aspx?ac=A02&cp=0&mc=AD04&order=0&tid=AD0400041770&direct=1|access-date=2021-10-12|website=www.cybernk.net}}</ref> After the establishment of [[Joseon|Joseon dynsasty]], the area belonged to [[Pyongan Province]].<ref name=":0" />

[[File:Landing_on_Nampho.jpg|left|thumb|Japanese troops landing on Nampo during the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]]]
The name of the city comes from the fishing village that was originally located in the Samhwa-hyon<ref group="Note">Now located in [[Ryonggang County]][http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Item/E0026951 <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>]</ref> area of South Pyongan Province. The city was renamed to Chinnampo during the [[Japanese occupation of Korea]], by adding the character '鎭'<ref group="Note">meaning 'to suppress, hold down'</ref> as during the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], the Japanese landed in Nampo and defeated the [[Qing dynasty]] forces. The name was immediately reverted to Nampo after [[Liberation of Korea|liberation]] to be rid of colonial legacies.<ref name=":0" />
[[File:Emblem of Jinnampo-bu.svg|thumb|Emblem of Chinnanfufu (Jinnampo-bu), the administrative division of Korea during Japanese rule that Nampo fell under.]]

=== After formation of North Korea ===
The city was founded in 1950 and contained 27 ''ri''. Various rearrangements occurred in 1952 and by 1960, there were 15 ''dong'' and 8 ''ri''.<ref name="univw" />

In December 1979, Nampo became a [[Directly-governed cities of North Korea|directly-governed city]]. [[Taean-guyok|Taean-si]], [[Ryonggang County|Ryonggang-gun]] were absorbed into Nampo and the former Nampo-si was reorganised into Nampo-guyok with jurisdiction over 26 ''dong''s.<ref name=":0" />

In 1983, a major reorganisation occurred and Nampo-guyok was split up into Waudo-guyok and Hanggu-guyok while Taean-si was split into Chollima-guyok, Taean-guyok and Kangso-guyok.<ref name=":0" />

On 9 January 2004, the [[Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly]] downgraded Nampo from a directly governed city (''chikhalsi'') to a normal city belonging to [[South Pyongan Province]]. For some time after this, Chollima-guyok, Kangso-guyok and Taean-guyok districts became counties (''gun)'' of South Pyongan Province.<ref name=":0" /> By 2012, these counties were re-promoted to districts.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Newstream|url=https://kcnawatch.org/newstream/|access-date=2021-10-12|website=KCNA Watch|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2010, the city was detached from South Pyongan Province, and the counties which were originally part of the city reassigned to it along with transferring administration of Onchon-gun to Nampo. Due to these changes, Nampo became the second largest city in North Korea.<ref name="univw" />  

In September 2020, a major uplifting of the city was completed, in accordance to the state policy of 'building local cities into distinctive towns'. This resulted in a seaside theme, with buildings mainly remodelled in blue, but also orange and browns. The strong [[Taean Friendship Glass Factory|local glass industry]] produced windows to glaze the apartment buildings. The supply of electricity, water and public transport was improved. As previously, the water supply was quoted to be 'insufficient' due to 'topographical conditions'.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Seaside town gets a fresh facelift|url=http://www.pyongyangtimes.com.kp/?bbs=35588|access-date=2021-10-11|website=www.pyongyangtimes.com.kp}}</ref>

== Economy ==
Nampo was originally a small fishing village that became a port for foreign trade in 1897, developing into a modern port in 1945 after [[World War II]]. With the rapid increase in state investment, the city's industrial capacity grew. Some of the city's industrial facilities include the city's Smelter Complex, Glass Corporation, [[Nampo Shipyard|Shipbuilding complex]], Fishery Complex, and other central and local factories. Nampo is a center for the DPRK shipbuilding industry. North of the city are facilities for freight transportation, aquatic products, and fishery, and a sea salt factory. Apples grown in the city's [[Ryonggang]] county (룡강군) are a famous local product.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=North Korea|encyclopedia=Britannica.com|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/North-Korea|access-date=14 December 2017}}</ref>

In a May 1981, [[Kim Il Sung]] drew up a plan for the city which included three goals:<ref name="univw" />

* to be developed into an international port city
* to increase export volume and be developed into the largest trading port in the DPRK
* to develop into the largest industrial area in the west of North Korea and to have a focus on heavy industry

=== Farming ===
As the city is located on the [[Taedong River]], the surrounding area is well suited to agriculture. [[Land reclamation]] occurs along the river and is used for [[Paddy field|rice growing]].<ref name=":1" /> Before [[Liberation of Korea|liberation]], the economy was mainly agricultural at 97%, but was in a very backwards condition. This was made worse by the Japanese plundering the rice grown locally. After the foundation of North Korea, the conditions rapidly improved and it was transformed into a modern rural economy and fishery industry.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=북한지역정보넷|trans-title=Nampo - economy|url=http://www.cybernk.net/infoText/InfoAdminstList.aspx?mc=AD0103&direct=1&ac=A0228%5C|access-date=2021-10-12|website=www.cybernk.net}}</ref>

47.8% of the agricultural land are paddy fields, 40% are fields, 8.7% are orchards and 2.7% are [[Mulberry]] fields. The majority of fields sown are for grains, while around 20% is for vegetables. Various livestock are grown on [[Cooperative farming|cooperative farms]], but also in private farms. The fishery industry in Nampo is one of the most important on the west coast.<ref name=":2" />

=== Health ===
The main hospital in Nampo is the Nampho City People's Hospital, which underwent major reconstruction in 2020. The new hospital is reported to greatly enhance the quality of medical services provided by the hospital. It has a [[Telemedical|telemedicine]] link to hospitals in Pyongyang to further improve the medical care provided.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hospital improves service quality|url=http://www.pyongyangtimes.com.kp/?bbs=36622|access-date=2021-10-11|website=www.pyongyangtimes.com.kp}}</ref>

Other treatment facilities in the city include the Nampho City Koryo Medicine Hospital,<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|title=Blind man works his way through college to become doctor|url=http://www.pyongyangtimes.com.kp/?bbs=35647|access-date=2021-10-11|website=www.pyongyangtimes.com.kp}}</ref> Nampho City Maternity Hospital and the Waudo District People's Hospital.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Doctor develops diagnostic device beyond call of duty|url=http://www.pyongyangtimes.com.kp/?bbs=33894|access-date=2021-10-11|website=www.pyongyangtimes.com.kp}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Local hospital improves maternity service|url=http://www.pyongyangtimes.com.kp/?bbs=29541|access-date=2021-10-11|website=www.pyongyangtimes.com.kp}}</ref> 

=== Industry ===
Prior to liberation, the industry was fully committed to military needs to supply the Japanese imperialist ambition and was an important port for munitions transport.<ref>{{Cite web|title=진남포시|url=https://terms.naver.com/entry.naver?cid=46618&docId=562027&categoryId=46618|access-date=2021-10-13|website=terms.naver.com|language=ko}}</ref> For convenience, the Japanese-built industries were clustered around what are now the districts of Waudo-guyok and Hunggu-guyok. Since then, Nampo has developed a strong economy with some industries in these areas being demolished and rebuilt in the corridor from Nampo to Pyongyang, such as in Chollima-guyok, Kangso-guyok or Taean-guyok.<ref name=":2" /><ref name="univw" />

The [[Nampo Smelting Complex]] is a key production complex and produces various copper products.<ref name=":2" /> It also smelts zinc and lead, although the zinc smelter was allegedly dismantled in 2001 due to pollution concerns.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Minerals Yearbook, Volume 3|publisher=Bureau of Mines|year=2006|isbn=9780160777103|pages=13.2}}</ref> Four other important industries of the city are the [[Chollima Steel Complex]], [[Taean Friendship Glass Factory]], [[Kumsong Tractor Factory]] and [[Taean Heavy Machine Complex]]. Although the city also has a range of light industry, the major companies are all invested in various forms of heavy industry.<ref name="univw" />

The position of the city has attracted foreign investment,<ref>{{Cite web|title=N. Korea Permits Foreign Capital Investment for Developing Nampo Port - Pulse by Maeil Business News Korea|url=https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2009&no=542399|access-date=2021-10-12|website=pulsenews.co.kr|language=ko}}</ref> an example being [[Pyeonghwa Motors]], which was a joint venture between the [[Unification Church]] and the North Korean government,<ref group="Note">Now 100% controlled by the North Korean government after the death of the founder of Unification Church</ref> where about 340 workers built cars from knock-down kits, mainly various Chinese cars and [[Fiat]]s.<ref name="univw" /> 

==== Defence ====
Nampo has an extensive shipbuilding capability, which along with cargo ships, also builds various warships.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-05-15|title=New North Korean Helicopter Frigates Spotted|url=https://www.38north.org/2014/05/jbermudez051514/|access-date=2021-10-31|website=38 North|language=en}}</ref>  A submersible [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] launch platform is based out of Nampo.

A number of [[Hainan class submarine chaser|Hainan (Taechong) class]] patrol vessels, [[Osa-class missile boat|Osa (Soju)-class missile boats]], [[Nongo class|Nongo class fast attack crafts]], [[Komar-class missile boat]]s, [[Nampo-class corvette]]s and a [[Najin-class frigate]] are based in Nampo.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-12-19|title=North Korean Navy – Light Frigates|url=https://warsearcher.com/shipsearcher/korean-peoples-navy-north-korea-current-and-retired/north-korean-navy-light-frigates/|access-date=2021-10-12|website=The Searchers|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-12-19|title=North Korean Navy – Corvettes and Patrol Ships|url=https://warsearcher.com/shipsearcher/korean-peoples-navy-north-korea-current-and-retired/north-korean-navy-corvettes-and-patrol-ships/|access-date=2021-10-12|website=The Searchers|language=en}}</ref>

==== Alleged uranium enrichment facility ====
In 2018, a report in ''[[The Diplomat]]'' claimed to have uncovered a [[Uranium enrichment]] facility in Chollima-guyok. A large building is said to contain the centrifuges for [[isotope separation]] and is surrounded by a wall, which according to the report, is a sign of a high security facility. The lack of snow on the roof of the building suggest that heat is being produced the entire year, and thus suggested that it is likely to be a uranium enrichment site.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Panda|first=Ankit|title=Exclusive: Revealing Kangson, North Korea's First Covert Uranium Enrichment Site|url=https://thediplomat.com/2018/07/exclusive-revealing-kangson-north-koreas-first-covert-uranium-enrichment-site/|access-date=2021-10-11|website=thediplomat.com|language=en-US}}</ref> 

However, these features are common in North Korea, and buildings with security fencing, on-site housing and monuments to the [[Kim family (North Korea)|Kim family]] and are not proof of a uranium enrichment facility. The [[Korean People's Army]] brigades that were assigned to the [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear program]] are fixed, unlike the shock troops deployed for [[Huichon Hydroelectric Power Station|hydroelectric power station]] or [[Mirae Scientists Street|apartment]] construction and if they were moved to Nampo, there should be evident signs in satellite imagery, of which there were none. Similarly, the security at the facility is comparably low, being accessed on an open road off the [[Youth Hero Motorway]] and with few facilities for security personal onsite. In comparison, the nearby [[Chamjin Missile Factory]] (Tae-sung Machine Plant) has noticeably higher security; an actual enrichment facility at the [[Nyongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center]] has multiple gates and inspection posts and is in a significantly less exposed position.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-08-03|title=Much Ado About Kangson {{!}} 38 North: Informed Analysis of North Korea|url=https://www.38north.org/2018/08/mmadden080318/|access-date=2021-10-11|website=38 North|language=en}}</ref>

=== Geography ===
[[File:1354_-_Nordkorea_2015_-_von_Nampo_nach_Käsong_(22566905827).jpg|thumb|Countryside of Nampo, by the [[Taedong River]]]]
Nampo is located on the west coast of Korea, and is mostly low-lying with 82% of the city below 50 metres elevation. There are mountains mostly in the south and east, which are generally below 100 metres above sea level,  forming a wavy plain. The highest points in the city are on the Osok mountain range, with Osok-san at 566&nbsp;m and Guksabong at 506&nbsp;m. The many rivers and streams flowing through the city provide good conditions for agriculture. Underneath the city, there are iron, manganese, [[titanium]] along with other precious metals, including gold and silver.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=북한지역정보넷|trans-title=Nampo - environment|url=http://www.cybernk.net/infoText/InfoAdminstList.aspx?mc=AD0102&direct=1&ac=A0228|access-date=2021-10-12|website=www.cybernk.net}}</ref><ref name="univw">{{Cite web|last=Dormels|first=Rainer|title=Profiles of the cities of DPR Korea – Nampho|url=https://dnk.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/p_koreanologie/North_Korean_Cities/Nampho/Nampho_01.pdf|website=[[Universitat Wien]]}}</ref>

=== Natural environment ===
Around 5,000 birds visit the Kumsong tideland and 76,000 waterbirds visit the lake created by the West Sea Barrage, which includes a number of endangered and vulnerable birds.<ref>{{Cite web|title=《조선의 오늘》|url=https://dprktoday.com/abroad/news/27578?lang=|access-date=2021-10-13|website=dprktoday.com}}</ref> 

==Transportation==
[[File:Hero Youth Highway in DPRK.jpg|right|thumb|The '[[Youth Hero Motorway]]' connecting [[Pyongyang]] to Nampo]]

===Road===
The [[Youth Hero Motorway]], completed in October 2000 connects Nampo to Pyongyang. The motorway was built mainly by younger people, and hence the road was renamed in commemoration of their efforts from Pyongyang-Nampo Motorway to the Youth Hero Motorway.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pyongyang-Nampo Motorway Completed|url=http://www.korea-np.co.jp/pk/149th_issue/2000101404.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030621091946/http://www.korea-np.co.jp/pk/149th_issue/2000101404.htm|archive-date=2003-06-21}}</ref> 

==== Public transport ====
Nampo has a [[trolleybus]] system which opened around 1982.<ref name="tm246-tarkhov">{{cite magazine |last1=Tarkhov |first1=Sergei |last2=Merzlov |first2=Dmitriy |title=North Korean Surprises – Part 3 |magazine=Trolleybus Magazine |issue=246 |date=November–December 2002 |pages=122–130 |publisher=National Trolleybus Association| location=UK |issn=0266-7452}}</ref> The system has a main line, running from [[Nampo Stadium]] to the northeast of the city and a branch from the main line to the west of the city, near the salt pans. The branch could be only served from the direction of the stadium, and was in poor condition with the [[overhead line]] no longer stretched with it not being used at least since 2011. In 2015, the service was reported intermittently operated if at all, and only on weekdays.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nampho [KP] - Nur wenig Verkehr|url=https://www.trolleymotion.eu/trolleynews/beitrag/?id=6244|access-date=2021-10-12|language=de-DE}}</ref> Operation was returned to normal from 24 August 2021, when the city authorities declared a push to improve transport, which included normalising the trolleybus service. As part of this push, around 20 derelict buses were repaired and brought back into service.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kim|first=Hyok-chol|date=2021-08-24|title=당결정관철에 떨쳐나선 도당위원회들의 소식-무조건적인 복무정신을 지니고 실천적인 대책을-남포시당위원회에서|url=http://rodong.rep.kp/ko/index.php?strPageID=SF01_02_01&newsID=2021-08-24-0003|access-date=2021-10-11|website=[[Rodong Sinmun]]}}</ref> 

In November 2015, a solar panel [[electric bus]] developed by the science and technological committee of Nampo was tested in the city. It is powered by 32 100-watt solar panels charging 50 [[Taedonggang Battery Factory|Taedonggang Batteries]] and powering a 95&nbsp;kW DC motor to carry up to 140 passengers at 40&nbsp;km/h and is part of the effort to alleviate the energy shortages in North Korea.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-11-02|title=北 '태양광 버스' 운행..."140명 태우고 시속 40km"|url=https://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0101_201511021858353961|access-date=2021-10-12|website=YTN|language=ko}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Nampho, electric bus # 103|url=https://transphoto.org/vehicle/520909/|access-date=2021-10-12|website=transphoto.org|language=en}}</ref>

===Air===
The only airport in Nampo is the military [[Onchon Airport|Onch'ŏn Air Base]] in Onch'ŏn-gun.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Onchon Air Base (KP-0023) @ OurAirports|url=https://ourairports.com/airports/KP-0023/|access-date=2021-10-12|website=ourairports.com}}</ref>

===Rail===
[[File:Chinampo-Pyongyang_Railway.jpg|thumb|Chinampo-Pyongyang Railway]]
The first rail line in Korea was built connecting Pyongyang and Chinnampo in 1895 by the Japanese military. It was an 88&nbsp;km line with cars that were man-powered and running on {{convert|21|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} tracks but was dismantled not long after it began operation.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-10-21|title=Pyongyang's first rail system|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/opinion/2021/10/721_257309.html|access-date=2021-10-13|website=koreatimes|language=en}}</ref>

The greater Nampo area is densely served by the [[Korean State Railway]], with a number of stations on the [[Pyongnam Line|P'yŏngnam Line]], the entirety of the [[Ryonggang Line|Ryonggang]], [[Sohaekammun Line|Sŏhaekammun]], [[Posan Line|Posan]], [[Nampohang Line|Nampohang]] and [[Taean Line|Taean]] lines, and one station on the [[Ullyul Line|Ŭllyul Line]] being located inside the boundaries of Namp'o-t'ŭkpyŏlsi. Branches off the Pyongnam line at Nampo station specifically serve the [[Nampo Smelting Complex]] and Nampo Electrode Factory.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|title=북한지역정보넷|trans-title=Nampo - transport|url=http://www.cybernk.net/infoText/InfoAdminstList.aspx?mc=AD0104&direct=1&ac=A0228|access-date=2021-10-12|website=www.cybernk.net}}</ref>

=== Water ===

==== River ====
With the city sitting on the [[Taedong River]], river transport is a significant form of transport. Passenger ships run from Nampo Port to [[Unnyul County|Sohae-ri]], [[Songrim]], [[Unchon County]] and [[Pyongyang]]. Cruise ships run between Waudo and the West Sea Barrage, and between Waudo and [[Mangyongdae]].<ref name=":4" />

====Sea====
The [[West Sea Barrage]] of the port of Nampo, built by erecting an 8-km long sea wall, has three lock chambers which allow the passage of ships up to 50,000 tons, and 36 [[sluices]]. Nampo Harbour is often used as the primary port of call for receiving foreign food aid assistance into [[North Korea]]. The port of Nampo has modern harbour facilities that can accommodate ships of 20,000 tonnes but is frozen during the winter.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nampo - 36°43'N 125°23'E|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/dprk/nampo.htm|access-date=2021-10-12|website=www.globalsecurity.org}}</ref> Nampo serves as Pyongyang's port on the [[Yellow Sea]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIlh9nNeadMC&q=Nampo%2C+North+Korea&pg=PA59|title=North Korea Handbook|first=Yonhap News Agency|last=Seoul|date=27 December 2002|publisher=M.E.

[[File:Dock_No._2._Nampo,_North_Korea.jpg|thumb|A cargo ship at Nampo port]]
In 2008, the harbour received several batches of grain delivery; the first batch delivered in June was sent by the [[United States]] and weighed 38,000 tons. A South Korean-based relief organisation, Join Together Society, donated one batch of flour in October of the same year weighing approximately 500 tons.<ref>[http://www.kinu.or.kr/2009/0727/white2009_e.pdf ''KINU White paper on human rights in North Korea'', 2009 (Chapter G.

Vehicle transport ships carry trucks between Nampo port and [[South Hwanghae Province]] through the West Sea Barrage, which saves time and fuel from driving a longer distance to the province.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jong|first=Hwa Sun|title=For the development of river transport|url=http://www.pyongyangtimes.com.kp/?bbs=25792|access-date=2021-10-11|website=www.pyongyangtimes.com.kp}}</ref>

During the [[COVID-19 pandemic in North Korea|COVID-19 pandemic]], there was a noticeable decrease in traffic at the Nampo Coal Port, with just a few or no ships visible.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-08-04|title=Nampo: A Tale of Two Ports {{!}} 38 North: Informed Analysis of North Korea|url=https://www.38north.org/2020/08/nampo080420/|access-date=2021-10-11|website=38 North|language=en}}</ref> Two tanks for petroleum or oil were finally built in 2020 after the bases were completed in 2016, while the other bases for the tanks remains unused.

=== Historical relics ===
Parts of the [[World Cultural Heritage]] listed [[Goguryeo tombs|Koguryo tombs]] are located in [[Ryonggang County]], dating to the 5th century which provides much information on the study of the social, architectural, painting and castles of the Koguryo dynasty. Although most of the murals have faded away, a portrait and a map are still present on the south walls.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Large tomb in Ryonggang|url=http://www.pyongyangtimes.com.kp/?bbs=35131|access-date=2021-10-13|website=www.pyongyangtimes.com.kp}}</ref>

The [[Hwangnyong Fortress]] was built during [[Koguryo]] and repaired in year 919 under the [[Koryo Dynasty]]. The original purpose was to defend Pyongyang from invaders in the southwest. The peaks in the north, east, south and west of the fort are used as observation posts during peacetime and can be used as command posts during wartime.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fort site highlights Korea's ancient wall-{{sic|nolink=y|reason=error in source|builidng}}|url=http://www.pyongyangtimes.com.kp/?bbs=30910|access-date=2021-10-13|website=www.pyongyangtimes.com.kp}}</ref>
