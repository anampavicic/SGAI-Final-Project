The [[Metropolitan Maputo|Maputo metropolitan area]] includes the neighbouring city of [[Matola]], and has a total population of 2,717,437. Maputo is a [[port city]], with an economy centered on commerce. It is noted for its vibrant cultural scene and distinctive, eclectic architecture.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/travel/in-search-of-the-real-africa-in-mozambique.html|title=In Search of the 'Real Africa' in Mozambique|last=Kugel|first=Seth|date=2014-03-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-21|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iywtDwAAQBAJ|title=Mozambique|last=Briggs|first=Philip|date=2017-08-14|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=9781784770556|pages=87|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PwTWm-wMdqQC|title=Mozambique|last=King|first=David C.|date=2007|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=9780761423317|pages=74|language=en}}</ref> Maputo was formerly named '''Lourenço Marques''' (until 1976).

Maputo is situated on [[Maputo Bay|a large natural bay]] on the [[Indian Ocean]], near where the rivers Tembe, Mbuluzi, Matola and Infulene converge. The city consists of seven administrative divisions, which are each subdivided into [[Quarter (urban subdivision)|quarters]] or ''bairros''. The city is surrounded by [[Maputo Province]], but is administered as a self-contained, separate [[Provinces of Mozambique|province]] since 1998. Maputo City is the geographically smallest and most densely populated province in Mozambique.<ref name=":0"/> Maputo is a [[wiktionary:cosmopolitan|cosmopolitan]] city, with [[Bantu languages|Bantu]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and, to a lesser extent, [[Arabic]], [[Gujarati language|Indian]], and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] languages and cultures present.{{cn|date=May 2023}} Almost 50% of Maputo speaks Portuguese as a native language as of  2017. <ref>{{Cite web |last=Reite |first=Torun |date=Feb 2020 |title=Language and spatiality in urban Mozambique: Ex-colonial language spread "from below" |url=https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Portuguese-as-home-language-1980-2007-and-2017_fig1_339068028 |access-date=August 11, 2024 |website=[[ResearchGate]]}}</ref>

The area on which Maputo stands was first settled as a [[fishing village]] by ancient Tsonga people.<ref name=":1" /> It was soon named Lourenço Marques, after [[Lourenço Marques (explorer)|the navigator of the same name]] who explored the area in 1544. The modern city traces its origins to a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] fort established on the site in 1781. A town grew around the fort starting around 1850, and in 1877 it was elevated to city status. In 1898, the colony of [[Portuguese Mozambique]] relocated its capital there. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Lourenço Marques grew both in population and economic development as a port city. Upon [[Mozambican War of Independence|Mozambican independence]] in 1975, the city became the national capital and was renamed Maputo. During the [[Mozambican Civil War]], the city's economy was devastated. When the war ended, the [[FRELIMO]] government launched a program to revive the city's economy, and to clean up the city by forcibly removing criminals, squatters, and undocumented residents.

Maputo has a number of landmarks, including [[Praça da Independência|Independence Square]], [[Maputo City Hall|City Hall]], [[Fort Nossa Senhora da Conceição de Lourenço Marques|Maputo Fortress]], the [[Maputo central market|central market]], [[Tunduru Gardens]], and [[Maputo Railway Station]]. Maputo is known as an aesthetically attractive, if dilapidated, city. With wide avenues lined by [[Jacaranda mimosifolia|jacaranda]] and [[acacia]] trees, it has earned the nicknames ''City of Acacias''<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://venturesafrica.com/discovering-africa-maputo-the-city-of-acacias/|title=Discovering Africa: Maputo, The 'City Of Acacias' - Ventures Africa|date=2014-07-06|work=Ventures Africa|access-date=2017-12-21|language=en-US}}</ref> and the ''Pearl of the Indian Ocean''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/mozambique-secret-beach-travel-guide|title=A Guide to Mozambique's Best-Kept Secret Beaches|work=Vogue|access-date=2017-12-21|language=en}}</ref> The city is known for its distinct, eclectic architecture, with [[Portuguese colonial architecture|Portuguese colonial]] [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] and [[Manueline]] styles alongside [[modern architecture|modern]] [[art deco]], [[bauhaus]], tropical modernism and [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] buildings.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/life/2017-10-09-be-sultry-in-a-city-that-lives-life-intensely/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326093100/https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/life/2017-10-09-be-sultry-in-a-city-that-lives-life-intensely/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018-03-26|title=Be sultry in a city that lives life intensely|last=Buitendach|first=Sarah|date=2017-10-09|work=BusinessDay|access-date=2017-12-21|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/arts/design/architecture-of-independence-in-africas-fast-growing-cities.html|title='Architecture of Independence' in Africa's Fast-Growing Cities|last=Farago|first=Jason|date=2017-03-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-21|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The historic ''Baixa de Maputo'' district is the [[downtown]] area.

The chief exports include [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[chromite]], [[sisal]], [[copra]], and [[hardwood]]. In addition to trade, the city has robust [[manufacturing]] and [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service]] sectors. Several colleges and universities are located in Maputo, including [[Pedagogical University]], São Tomás University, Catholic University of Mozambique, and [[Eduardo Mondlane University]], the oldest in the country.

[[File:Cathedral_of_maputo_01.jpg|thumb|Cathedral of Maputo]]

On the northern bank of Espírito Santo Estuary of [[Delagoa Bay]], an inlet of the [[Indian Ocean]], Lourenço Marques was named after [[Lourenço Marques (explorer)|the Portuguese navigator]] who, with António Caldeira, was sent in 1544 by the governor of [[Island of Mozambique|Mozambique]] on a voyage of exploration.<ref>Britannica,[https://www.britannica.com/place/Maputo Maputo], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref> They explored the lower courses of the rivers emptying their waters into Delagoa Bay, notably the Espírito Santo. The forts and trading stations that the Portuguese established, abandoned and reoccupied on the north bank of the river were all named "Lourenço Marques".{{cn|date=July 2023}} The existing town dates from about 1850, with the previous settlement having been entirely destroyed by the natives. The town developed around a Portuguese fortress completed in 1787.{{cn|date=July 2023}}

On 9 December 1876, Lourenço Marques was elevated to the status of village, and on the 10 November 1887 it became a city.<ref>Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/Maputo Maputo], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref> The Luso-British conflict for the possession of Lourenço Marques ended on the 24th of July 1875 with [[Patrice de MacMahon]], the [[President of the French Republic|French President]], ruling in favour of Portugal.

In 1871, the town was described as a poor place, with narrow streets, fairly good flat-roofed houses, grass huts, decayed forts, and a rusty cannon, enclosed by a recently erected wall {{convert|6|ft|order=flip}} high and protected by bastions at intervals. The growing importance of the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] led, however, to greater interest being taken back in Portugal in the development of a port. A commission was sent by the Portuguese government in 1876 to drain the marshy land near the settlement, to plant the blue [[gum tree]], and to build a hospital and a church. A city since 1887, it superseded the [[Island of Mozambique]] as the capital of [[Portuguese East Africa|Mozambique]] in 1898. In 1895, the opening of the [[NZASM]] railroad to [[Pretoria]], [[South Africa]], caused the city's population to grow. The [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush]], which began in 1886, also increased the economic development of the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as Lourenço Marques served as the closest seaport for the export of gold from South Africa.<ref name="AndersenJenkins2015">{{cite journal|last1=Andersen|first1=Jørgen Eskemose|last2=Jenkins|first2=Paul|last3=Nielsen|first3=Morten|title=Who Plans the African city?

[[File:Admiralty Chart No 646 Porto de Lourenco Marques, Published 1951.jpg|thumb|left|1951 nautical chart of the port of Lourenço Marques]]
In the early 20th century, with a well equipped seaport, with piers, quays, landing sheds and electric cranes which enabled large vessels to discharge cargoes direct into the railway trucks, Lourenço Marques developed under Portuguese rule and achieved great importance as a lively cosmopolitan city. It was served by British, Portuguese, and German liners, and the majority of its imported goods were shipped to [[Southampton]], [[Lisbon]], and [[Hamburg]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

With the continuous growth of the city's population due to its expanding economy centred on the seaport, from the 1940s Portugal's administration built a network of primary and secondary schools, industrial and commercial schools as well as the first university in the region. The [[University of Lourenço Marques]] was opened in 1962. Portuguese, Islamic (including [[Ismaili]]s), Indian (including from [[Portuguese India]]) and Chinese (including [[Macanese people|Macanese]]) communities — but not the unskilled African majority — achieved great prosperity by developing the industrial and commercial sectors of the city. Urban areas of Mozambique grew quickly in this period due to the lack of restriction on the internal migration of indigenous Mozambicans, a situation that differed from the [[apartheid]] policies of neighbouring South Africa.<ref name="AndersenJenkins2015"/> Before Mozambique's independence in 1975, thousands of tourists from [[South Africa]] and [[Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]) frequented the city and its scenic beaches, high-quality hotels, restaurants, casinos, and brothels.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUuUybBmqDc "Lourenço Marques a cidade feitiço" on YouTube], a film of Lourenço Marques, Portuguese Mozambique in 1970.</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NkVCcZ_OH0 "Lourenco Marques" on YouTube], a film of Lourenço Marques, Portuguese Mozambique.</ref>

The Mozambique Liberation Front, or [[FRELIMO]], formed in [[Tanzania]] in 1962 and led by [[Eduardo Mondlane]], fought for independence from Portuguese rule. The [[Mozambican War of Independence]] lasted over 10 years, ending only in 1974 when the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime was overthrown in Lisbon by a leftist military coup — the [[Carnation Revolution]]. The new government of Portugal granted independence to almost all Portuguese overseas territories (except for [[Portuguese Timor|Timor Leste]] and [[Macau]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

The words "Aqui é Portugal" (''Here is Portugal'') were once inscribed on the walkway of its municipal building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aemo.org/Ofenomenodanossadescolonizacao.htm |title=O fenómeno da nossa descolonização: Retornados, Deslocados e Espoliados|access-date=2014-04-01 |work=Joaquim Pereira Soares |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611165759/http://www.aemo.org/Ofenomenodanossadescolonizacao.htm |archive-date=2016-06-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Independence===

The [[People's Republic of Mozambique]] was proclaimed on 25 June 1975 in accordance with the [[Lusaka Accord]] signed in September 1974.<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 181</ref><ref name="a">{{cite web |url=https://pt.wikisource.org/wiki/Acordo_de_Lusaka |title=Acordo de Lusaka |language=pt |trans-title=Lusaka Accord |publisher=Diário do Governo, Portugal |date=1974 |access-date=2016-02-06 }}</ref> A parade and a state banquet completed the independence festivities in the capital, which was expected to be renamed Can Phumo, or "Place of Phumo", after a [[Shangaan]] chief who lived in the area before the Portuguese navigator [[Lourenço Marques (explorer)|Lourenço Marques]] first visited the site in 1545 and gave his name to it.<ref name=port>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101022145635/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C913229-2%2C00.html "Dismantling the Portuguese Empire"], ''[[Time Magazine]]'' (July 7, 1975)</ref> However, after independence, the city's [[Geographical renaming|name was changed]] (in February 1976) to Maputo. Maputo's name reputedly has its origin in the [[Maputo River]]: in fact, this river, which marks the border with [[South Africa]] in the  southernmost extent of Mozambique, had become symbolic during the FRELIMO-led armed struggle against Portuguese sovereignty{{cn|date=May 2023}}, after the motto «''Viva Moçambique unido, do Rovuma ao Maputo''», that is, ''Hail Mozambique, united from Rovuma down to Maputo'' ([[Rovuma]] is the river which marks the northern border with [[Tanzania]]).

After the independence, the statues to Portuguese heroes in the capital city were removed and most were stored at the fortress. FRELIMO soldiers carrying Russian rifles replaced [[Portuguese Army]] soldiers (both black and white) with western arms in city barracks and on the streets.{{cn|date=May 2023}}

After the [[Carnation Revolution]] in Lisbon, over 250,000 Portuguese emigrated virtually overnight,<ref name=port/> leaving Mozambique's economy and administration unmanageable. With the exodus of trained Portuguese personnel, the newly independent country had no time to allocate resources to maintain its infrastructure. In addition, authoritarian [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] policies and bureaucratic central planning made the newly independent country slip into an extremely precarious condition since the beginning, and so the economy plummeted. FRELIMO, now the governing party, turned to the [[communist]] governments of the [[Soviet Union]] and [[East Germany]] for help. By the early 1980s the country was bankrupt. Money was worthless and shops were empty. Starting shortly after independence, the country was plagued by the [[Mozambican Civil War]], a long and violent struggle between [[FRELIMO]] and [[RENAMO]], which lasted from 1977 to 1992. The war adversely affected economic activity and political stability in the city. "Operation Production" (''Operação Produção'') was inaugurated in 1983 by the ruling FRELIMO party to deal with the economic crisis. Undocumented residents of Maputo, the "parasitic" urban population, as well as individuals who displayed criminal behaviour, were forcibly transferred to state-owned communal farms and villages in the rural north of Mozambique.<ref name="AndersenJenkins2015"/><ref name="Thompson2015">{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=Drew A.|title=Constructing a History of Independent Mozambique, 1974–1982: A Study in Photography|journal=Kronos|volume=39|issue=1|year=2013|pages=179}}</ref>

Since the peace agreement ending the civil war, which was signed in 1992, the country and the city has returned to its pre-independence levels of political stability. This stability is an encouraging sign that makes Mozambique a promising country for foreign investment.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:22294362~menuPK:141310~pagePK:34370~piPK:34424~theSitePK:4607,00.html|title=News & Broadcast - Mozambique: Mining an Opportunity|website=web.worldbank.org|access-date=1 October 2017}}</ref>

On 11 July 2003, the [[Maputo Protocol|Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa]], better known as the [[Maputo Protocol]], was adopted in the city by the [[African Union]].

=== Climate change ===
A 2019 paper published in [[PLOS One]] estimated that under [[Representative Concentration Pathway#4.5|Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5]], a "moderate" scenario of [[climate change]] where global warming reaches ~{{convert|2.5-3|C-change|F-change}} by 2100, the climate of Maputo in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of [[Goiania]] in [[Brazil]]. The annual temperature would increase by {{convert|1.8|C-change|F-change}}, and the temperature of the warmest month by {{convert|1.5|C-change|F-change}}, while the temperature of the coldest month would increase by {{convert|0.3|C-change|F-change}}.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bastin |first1=Jean-Francois |last2=Clark |first2=Emily |last3=Elliott |first3=Thomas |last4=Hart |first4=Simon |last5=van den Hoogen |first5=Johan |last6=Hordijk |first6=Iris |last7=Ma |first7=Haozhi |last8=Majumder |first8=Sabiha |last9=Manoli |first9=Gabriele |last10=Maschler |first10=Julia |last11=Mo |first11=Lidong |last12=Routh |first12=Devin |last13=Yu |first13=Kailiang |last14=Zohner |first14=Constantin M. |last15=Thomas W. |first15=Crowther |title=Understanding climate change from a global analysis of city analogues |journal=PLOS ONE |date=10 July 2019 |volume=14 |issue=7 |at=S2 Table.

Moreover, Maputo is particularly vulnerable to impacts such as [[cyclone]]s and flooding caused by [[sea level rise]]. Poverty and inequality, which are concentrated in the overpopulated [[bairro]]s, further exacerbate climate change vulnerabilities in the city.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/resource/urban-planning-mozambique/ A local vision of climate adaptation: Participatory urban planning in Mozambique], Vanesa Castán Broto, Emily Boyd, Jonathan Ensor, Domingos Augusto Macucule and Charlotte Allen, the [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], 2014</ref> According to the 2022 [[IPCC Sixth Assessment Report]], Maputo is one of 12 major African cities ([[Abidjan]], [[Alexandria]], [[Algiers]], [[Cape Town]], [[Casablanca]], [[Dakar]], [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Durban]], [[Lagos]], [[Lomé]], [[Luanda]] and Maputo) which would be the most severely affected by future sea level rise. It estimates that they would collectively sustain cumulative damages of USD 65 billion under RCP 4.5 and USD 86.5 billion for the high-emission scenario RCP 8.5 by the year 2050. Additionally, RCP 8.5 combined with the hypothetical impact from [[marine ice sheet instability]] at high levels of warming would involve up to 137.5 billion USD in damages, while the additional accounting for the "low-probability, high-damage events" may increase aggregate risks to USD 187 billion for the "moderate" RCP4.5, USD 206 billion for RCP8.5 and USD 397 billion under the high-end ice sheet instability scenario.<ref>Trisos, C.H., I.O.

==Administrative subdivisions==
[[File:Map Districts of Maputo.png|thumb|Districts of Maputo]]

The city is divided into seven main administrative divisions. Each of these consists of several smaller city quarters or ''bairros''.

The central area of Maputo is a planned city with square blocks and wide avenues, with Portuguese traces and their typical architecture of the 1970s. After the [[Carnation Revolution]] (1974) military coup in [[Lisbon]], Portuguese refugees fled in massive numbers close to the date of independence (1975), and the resultant lack of skills and capital, in the context of a fierce civil war and government mismanagement, contributed to its state of dereliction in the years following these events.{{cn|date=May 2023}}

Recovery of the older infrastructure has been slow and most property developers in recent years{{which|date=May 2023}} have decided to invest in the construction of new properties rather than rehabilitating any of the existing ones. The rates for property in the city are high as investment increases, larger numbers of businesses are hoping to locate within easy reach of the airports, banks and other facilities.{{cn|date=May 2023}}

Maputo faces many challenges, such as poor transport and drainage infrastructure, which have profound implications on people's livelihoods, particularly in informal settlements. Inadequate planning regulation and law enforcement, as well as perceived corruption in government processes, lack of communication across government departments and lack of concern or government coordination with respect to building codes are major impediments to progressing the development of Maputo's infrastructure, according to the [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]].<ref>[http://cdkn.org/future-climate-africa/ Future Climate for Africa] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415220758/http://cdkn.org/future-climate-africa/ |date=2015-04-15 }}. [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], accessed 2015-04-16</ref>

As a coastal city, Maputo is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise, and population growth is putting increasing pressure on the coastal areas.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FCFA_PolicyBrief_Accra-Maputo_WEB1.pdf Using climate information to achieve long-term development objectives in coastal Ghana and Mozambique]. [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], accessed 2015-04-16</ref>

===PROMAPUTO===
{{unreferencedsect|date=May 2023}}
In 2007, the municipality of Maputo began a project to seriously consider rehabilitating the city's infrastructure. PROMAPUTO was a project that began as co-operation between the local city council and the [[International Development Association]] (IDA) of the [[World Bank]]. The first phase (PROMAPUTO1) took place between 2007 and 2010 and was chiefly concerned with developing the systems, knowledge and planning required to support the gradual overhaul of the infrastructure. The project was broken into several key areas and a budget allocated to each of these, namely: Institutional Development, Financial Sustainability, Urban Planning, Urban Infrastructure Investment and Maintenance, Metropolitan Development (services such as waste collection and disposal). The total financial allocation for this phase was USD 30 million. Little was done, however.
[[File:A Direcção dos Correios, Telégrafos e Telefones e o seu pessoal - Lourenço Marques.jpg|thumb|left|Maputo's central mail station]]

In 2011, PROMAPUTO2, the second phase of the project began. This phase was to last until 2015 and a total of USD 105 million was spent. The plan called for an IT systems, Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) together with [[Geographic Information System]] ([[GIS]]). These systems would supposedly help the municipality control its budgets and manage tenders, while the [[GIS]] would allow for precise information about land location and titling to be kept. Several roads should have been expanded and improved and the Avenida Julius Nyerere finally completed. Financial sustainability for the project was to be guaranteed through the improved collection of property tax (IPRA). The project also coincided with the recent overhaul of the Road Safety and Traffic Regulations (final completion 2020) which was an antiquated system that had not seen changes since the 1950s. Amongst the new regulations, heavy penalties and fines would now apply to many detrimental actions done by automobiles, such as pollution, loud noises, and illegal maneuvers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

===Building projects===
[[File:Maputo–Katembe bridge from the norther shore; July 2018.jpg|thumb|On November 10, 2018, the [[Maputo–Katembe bridge]], Africa's largest [[suspension bridge]], was inaugurated, connecting the cities of Maputo and [[Katembe]]]]

In spite of its previous instability, Mozambique is experiencing one of the fastest growth rates for a developing country in the world.<ref>"Mozambique: From Post-Conflict Recovery to High Growth" (July 2009) The World Bank [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/IDA/Resources/IDA-Mozambique.pdf]</ref> The projected growth rate for 2011 is expected to be around 7.5%, some of it centered on the construction of several capital intensive projects in Maputo. Some of the more notable developments include Edificio 24, a mixed-use development that will be located at the center of the city along Avenida 24 Julho and Avenida Salvador Allende. The Maputo Business Tower is a modern 19-story building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mbtmaputo.com/about-mbt.php|title=Maputo Business Tower|website=mbtmaputo.com}}</ref> The Radisson Blu corporation  has  constructed a 22 story hotel with 256 rooms in one of the city's trendiest spots on the ''marginal'' along the beach. A 15-story building for the second largest telecommunication company in the country, [[Vodacom]], was projected to be completed in 2010. The regeneration of the Maputo waterfront is an urban regeneration project that is being developed at site of the former annual industrial fair grounds (FACIM).{{cn|date=May 2023}}

===Rehabilitation projects===
{{Unreferencedsect|date=May 2023}}
In February 2011, president [[Armando Guebuza]] announced that the [[Vila Algarve]] would be restored to its former condition and the building transformed into a museum for the veterans of the civil war. The Vila Algarve belonged to the [[PIDE|International and State Defence Police (PIDE)]] during colonial rule. It was where political prisoners and others accused of conspiring to harm the regime were taken for interrogation and torture. There are claims that several individuals were executed in the building. No dates have been released on when the renovation is to commence. The building has changed ownership several times and has been an off-on residence for squatters.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

===Sports facilities===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:gadlopezmaputo.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's impression of the cityscape in the future]] -->
Maputo has a number of stadiums designed for football, which can be modified for other purposes, such as the new [[Estádio do Zimpeto]], [[Estádio do Maxaquene]] and the [[Estádio do Costa do Sol]] which can seat 32,000, 15,000 and 10,000 people respectively. The largest stadium in the Metropolitan Area is, however, the [[Estádio da Machava]] (opened as Estádio Salazar), located in neighbouring [[Matola]] municipality. It opened in 1968, in Machava and was at the time the most advanced in the country conforming to standards set by [[FIFA]] and the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI). The cycling track could be adjusted to allow for 20,000 more seats.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/emoitas/3765484514/|title=Estádio Salazar 1968|date=28 July 2009 |access-date=1 October 2017}}</ref> It was the site where [[Portugal]] officially handed over the country to [[Samora Machel]] and [[FRELIMO]] on 25 June 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYFB7lyVk2U| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/vYFB7lyVk2U| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|title=INDEPENDÊNCIA DE MOÇAMBIQUE|last=ALBERTINO SILVA|date=13 April 2008|access-date=1 October 2017|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In 2005, the [[Birmingham]] based [[reggae]] group [[UB40]] held a one-night-only concert in the stadium filled to maximum capacity. A newer stadium called the [[Estádio do Zimpeto]] which is located in the suburb of Zimpeto will be opened in 2011.{{update after|2011|12|31}} The stadium will be built in time for the [[2011 All-Africa Games]] with a capacity for 42,000 spectators. A smaller football stadium, [[Estádio Mahafil]], holds 4,000 people.

Beginning in the 1950s, motorsport was introduced to the city. At first race cars would compete in areas around the city, Polana and along the ''marginal'' but as funding and interest increased, a dedicated race track was built in the Costa Do Sol area along and behind the ''marginal'' with the ocean to the east with a length of {{convert|1.5|km|1|abbr=on}}. The initial surface of the new track, named Autódromo de Lourenço Marques did not provide enough grip and a crash in the late 1960s killed eight people and injured many more. Therefore, in 1970, the track was renovated and the surface changed to meet the safety requirements that were needed at large events with many spectators. The length then increased to {{convert|3909|km|0|abbr=on}}. The city became host to several international and local events beginning with the inauguration on 26 November 1970.<ref>[http://autosport.aeiou.pt/gen.pl?p=stories&op=view&fokey=as.stories/64170 "Autódromo Lourenço Marques" (8 January 2009) ''AutoSport''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005064411/http://autosport.aeiou.pt/gen.pl?p=stories&op=view&fokey=as.stories%2F64170 |date=5 October 2011 }}</ref> The track was abandoned after 1975 and events only occurred sporadically such as in 1981 when the government allowed the sport again. Since 2000, interest has been rekindled by the Automovel & Touring Club de Moçambique (ATCM) and several events including go-carting, drag racing and motocross are planned.

The city's main basketball arena is the [[Pavilhão do Maxaquene]] which holds up to 3,500 people. It is home to [[Ferroviário de Maputo (basketball)|Ferroviário de Maputo]] which competes in the [[Basketball Africa League]] and the [[Mozambican Basketball League]].

===Street names===

The street names were changed after independence in 1975. Close ties with the [[Eastern Bloc]] highly influenced the new names that were chosen as did removal of names referring to colonial era figures.

==Transport==
===Airports===

[[Maputo International Airport]] is the main international airport of Mozambique. The new terminal was opened in 2010 with a capacity for 900,000 passengers per year. Work has begun on the construction of a new domestic terminal which will have a capacity for many more passengers at any given time. The construction work will require the current building to be demolished.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

===Buses===
Maputo's transportation needs are mainly served by minibus taxis called ''chapas'', which transport the majority of the city's commuters. In an effort to resolve a public transport crisis in the city, the state-owned company, Transporte de Moçambique (TPM) has recently acquired a new fleet of 270+ buses. There are three major bus terminals in the city: at Baixa (downtown/central), Museu (Museum), and at Junta (regional and national buses).{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

===Ferries===

[[File:Maputo Train Station.jpg|thumb|right|The Maputo Railway Station, an example of colonial architecture]]

Ferry boats departing from Maputo to the district of KaTembe are available during the week. A ferry can carry approximately 20 vehicles per trip.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

===Rails===
The city of Maputo lies at the end of three railway lines: [[Goba railway]], [[Limpopo railway]] and [[Pretoria–Maputo railway]].<ref name="Atlassian">[https://dlca.logcluster.org/display/public/DLCA/2.4+Mozambique+Railway+Assessment Mozambique Logistics Infrastructure: Mozambique Railway Assessment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210802142842/https://dlca.logcluster.org/display/public/DLCA/2.4+Mozambique+Railway+Assessment |date=2021-08-02 }}. Atlassian Confluence. 10 de dezembro de 2018.</ref>

====Trams====
Maputo was home to one of the first electric tramway systems in Africa, commencing in February 1904.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ehgarde.planetaclix.pt/mocambique/eletricos/tramlm.htm|title=Tramways Eléctricos de Lourenço Marques|website=ehgarde.planetaclix.pt|access-date=2010-12-19|archive-date=2020-08-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803212305/http://ehgarde.planetaclix.pt/mocambique/eletricos/tramlm.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> At first the lines ran from the Central Railway Station (CFM) to the City Municipality building. It is said{{by whom|date=April 2016}} that the establishment of the tram system caused some protests from the general public as certain classes had limited access to its use. Trams lost favor in the second half of the 20th century as cars and buses became more common, and they have not been in use at all since 1936, although parts of some of the tracks can still be seen coming up through the tar in certain streets, like Av. 24 de Julho.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

===Ports===
[[File:Maputo skyline 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Maputo's harbour is very important economically to the city.]]

The main [[port of Maputo]] handled 17 million tons of cargo in 1971, at its peak. It was part of the trio of Mozambique's main ports for the Nacala-Beira-Maputo route. Today, it is managed by the Maputo Port Development Company (MPDC), a joint venture of [[Grindrod Bank|Grindrod]] and [[DP World]]. The government has allowed the firm to manage the port until 2030 in order to upgrade much of its infrastructure that has been destroyed after years of stagnation. In 2010, the dredging works in the channel were finished and the Port of Maputo can now handle larger vessels – such as the Panamax vessels – with more cargo. In addition, investments are being made for specific types of terminals such as:{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}
* Bulk liquids
* Granite
* Metals
* Coal

A new terminal for vehicles is also planned which will allow for 57,000 vehicles to be moved per year (Phase 1) with a peak 250,000 under an agreement with [[Höegh Autoliners]] as a potential trans-shipment route between the [[Middle East]] and [[Europe]]. Coal will also be exported from the [[Matola]] side at a rate of 10 million tons per year. It is envisaged that by 2020, the port will generate about USD 160 million per year. By 2030, the port will be able to handle up to 25 trains a day and 1,500 trucks for a total of 50 million tons of cargo per year. The total investment will exceed USD 500 million.<ref>{{cite web |title=Port Canaveral |url=https://www.portcanaveral.com/Cruise/Cruise-Terminal-3 |access-date=4 June 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Terminal 3 Frankfurt |url=https://terminal3.frankfurt-airport.com/en/ |access-date=4 June 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Maritine Executive |url=https://maritime-executive.com/ |access-date=4 June 2024}}</ref>

===Other means===
A recent introduction is three-wheelers commonly known as [[tuk-tuk]]s in some Asian countries. The three-wheeled bikes, called "tchopelas" by the population, are cheaper to own and run and have posed a commercial threat to conventional taxis.<ref>{{cite web |title=Earthbound report about three-wheelers |url=https://earthbound.report/2019/03/12/the-role-of-three-wheelers-in-sustainable-urban-transport/ |access-date=4 June 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Ventures Africa |url=https://venturesafrica.com/the-evolution-of-kenyas-tuk-tuk-in-pictures/ |access-date=4 June 2024}}</ref>

==Architecture==

Maputo had always been the center of attention during its formative years and this strong artistic spirit was responsible for attracting some of the world's most forward architects at the turn of the 20th century. The city is home to masterpieces of building work by [[Pancho Guedes]], [[Herbert Baker]] and Thomas Honney, amongst others. The earliest architectural efforts around the city focused on classical European designs such as the Central Train Station (CFM) designed by architects Alfredo Augusto Lisboa de Lima, Mario Veiga and Ferreira da Costa and built between 1913 and 1916 (sometimes mistaken with the work of [[Gustav Eiffel]]),<ref>Morais, João Sousa. ''Maputo, Património da Estrutura e Forma Urbana, Topologia do Lugar''. Livros Horizonte, 2001, p. 110.(in Portuguese)</ref> and the Hotel Polana designed by [[Herbert Baker]].

As the 1960s and 1970s approached, Maputo was yet again at the center of a new wave of architectural influences made most popular by Pancho Guedes. The designs of the 1960s and 1970s were characterized by [[modernist]] and [[brutalist]] movements of clean, straight and functional structures. However, prominent architects such as Pancho Guedes fused this with local art schemes giving the city's buildings a unique Mozambican theme. As a result, most of the properties erected during the second construction boom take on these styling cues.<ref>Abdel, Hana (9 July 2021). Retrieved 24 December 2023.

===Loss of heritage===
{{Unreferencedsect|date=May 2023}}
In recent years{{when|date=May 2023}}, the influx of capital into the real estate sector from local and international investors has resulted in the demolition of many historically significant buildings. Single homes along Av. Julius Nyerere, Av. 24 de Julho and Av. Mao Tse Tung have been torn down and high rise residential apartments built in their place. The difficulty in legally expanding the city coupled with a limited heritage building protection framework have been the main impediments. The local government, the City Council of Maputo has been unable to bring order to the situation. {{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

Additionally, many acacia trees that once lined the footpaths and gave the city its distinct identity have also been removed for unclear reasons. The process gains momentum usually in the winter months between June and August under the guise of pruning overgrown trees. Without proper supervision the pruning work is excessive and destructive leading to the eventual loss of the tree.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

==Culture==
Maputo is a melting pot of several cultures. The [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] and [[Portuguese People|Portuguese]] cultures dominate, but the influence of [[Arab]], [[India]]n, and [[China|Chinese]] cultures is also felt.

===Film and cinema===
Before television was introduced in 1981, film and cinema had a prominent position as a form of entertainment in the lives of Mozambicans especially in Maputo where there were at least a dozen movie theaters by the time of independence.{{cn|date=July 2023}} In the 1950s and 1960s, at the height of racial segregation, most of the movie-goers were either European whites or South Asians – each group having their own designated locale. Black Mozambicans, although more heavily discriminated against, also enjoyed movies in makeshift theatres, often in rooms temporarily converted to handle a projector, screen and chairs.{{cn|date=July 2023}} 

For much of the late 1970s and 1980s, the local film industry was geared towards creating "home-made" productions depicting [[Socialist]] ideologies which placed great influence on the family unit, the non-commercialized production of agriculture and political autonomy. Maputo has been the setting for many [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] blockbuster movies such as ''[[The Interpreter (2005 film)|The Interpreter]]'', ''[[Blood Diamond (film)|Blood Diamond]]'' and ''[[Ali (film)|Ali]]''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

===Associação Núcleo de Arte===

[[File:Telecomunicações de Moçambique, Rua da Sé 2, Maputo, Moçambique.jpg|thumb|right|Telecommunications of Mozambique seat in Rua da Sé 2, Maputo]]

An important cultural and artists' centre in Maputo is the Associação Núcleo de Arte. It is the oldest collective of artists in Mozambique. Seated in an old villa in the centre of Maputo the Núcleo has played a significant role in metropolitan cultural life for decades. The two best known and most influential contemporary Mozambican artists started their career at Núcleo de Arte, the painter [[Malangatana Ngwenya]] and the sculptor [[Alberto Chissano]]. Over one hundred painters, sculptors and ceramists are members of the Núcleo, which regularly stages exhibitions on its own premises and over the last few years has actively participated in exchanges with artists from abroad. The Núcleo became well known for their project transforming arms into tools and objects of art. It played an important role for reconciliation after the [[Mozambican Civil War]]. The exhibition of art objects such as the [[Throne of Weapons|Chair of the African King]] and the [[Tree of Life (Kester)|Tree of Life]] was shown around the world, among others in the [[British Museum]] in 2006.<ref name="tes">{{cite web|last=Spring|first=Chris|title=Farewell to Arms|url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=2170276|work=[[Times Educational Supplement]]|publisher=TSL Education Ltd.|access-date=29 September 2010|display-authors=etal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610162346/http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=2170276|archive-date=2011-06-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>
Maputo is home to the [[Dockanema]] Documentary Film Festival, and international festival showcasing documentary films from around the world.

=== Handicraft ===
Mozambique's capital is famous for making special small sculptures called "pshikelekedanas" from soft wood using a penknife. These sculptures often depict important animals in Mozambique, like hippos, etc...<ref>{{Cite web |title=Maputo - My Tours Company |url=https://mytours.company/en/maputo/ |access-date=2023-10-07 |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Landmarks ==
During its five centuries of Portuguese colonialization, the city has gained several examples of Portuguese architecture. Most of the noteworthy buildings are former colonial administrative buildings or current government buildings.

==Parks==
[[File:Flowered Maputo.jpg|thumb|A flowered terrace in Maputo]]

The city does not yet have a very expansive list of parks and other recreational areas. However, at the center of the city lies the Jardim Tunduru ([[Tunduru Gardens]]) which was formerly called the Vasco Da Gama Garden. It was designed in the 1880s by a [[United Kingdom|British]] architect, Thomas Honney. The entrance of the park is designed in the [[Neo-Manueline]] style. After independence, the name was changed to the current one and a statue of the country's first president was erected.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

==Education==
Maputo offers several options for education with pre-schools, primary, secondary schools and higher education institutions. The quality of the syllabus is said to differ greatly depending on whether an institution is private or public.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

===Higher education===
Mozambique's largest higher education institution is the [[Universidade Eduardo Mondlane]] which was established in 1968 as the Universidade de Lourenço Marques. Most of the universities faculties and departments are located in the city of Maputo with nearly 8,000 students attending 10 faculties. Some faculties also exist in [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], [[Quelimane]], Nampula and [[Inhambane]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

Since the 1990s there has also been a rapid growth of private education houses offering higher education such as ''Instituto Superior de Ciências e Tecnologias de Moçambique'' (ISCTEM), ''Instituto Superior de Tecnologias e Gestão'' (ISTEG) and ''Instituto Superior de Transportes e Comunicações'' (ISUTC).
{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}
===Secondary education===
In the secondary education market, there is again a strong divergence between private and public schooling.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

Maputo's notable private schools include:

* [[Escola Portuguesa de Moçambique]]
* [[American International School of Mozambique]]
* The Aga Khan Academy, Maputo<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agakhanacademies.org/maputo|title=Welcome to the Aga Khan Academy, Maputo - Aga Khan Academies|website=www.agakhanacademies.org|access-date=1 October 2017}}</ref>{{third-party inline|date=March 2023}}

==Health services==
[[File:Hospital_Central_de_Maputo_(503881920).jpg|thumb|Central Hospital of Maputo]]

Maputo has several hospitals and clinics, including the city and country's largest hospital, the [[Maputo Central Hospital|Hospital Central de Maputo]]. Other hospitals include the public Hospital Geral José Macamo, and the private Clinica Sommerschield, the Clínica Cruz Azul in ''baixa'' and Hospital Privado located across the Portuguese School.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

The construction of Hospital Miguel Bombarda began in 1900. In 1976, [[Samora Machel]] renamed the hospital as ''Hospital Central de Maputo'' (HCM). The hospital has 1500 beds for in-patients and has an estimated staff number of 3000. It is made of a multi-block structure with 35 separate buildings spanning an area of 163,800 m<sup>2</sup>. The hospital has six departments: [[Medicine]], [[Surgery]], [[Pediatrics]], [[Orthopedics]], [[Gynaecology]] and [[Obstetrics]]. It also has divisions for [[Ophthalmology]] and [[Otolaryngology]] and a morgue. The hospital provides services for an average 700 out-patients a day and over {{convert|1000|kg|0|abbr=on}} of washing is done daily. In the early 1990s, a section of the hospital was divided and turned into a private clinic offering higher quality services for those who could afford it called the ''Clínica Especial de Maputo''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.misau.gov.mz/pt/provincias/cidade_de_maputo/hospital_central_de_maputo|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122000800/http://www.misau.gov.mz/pt/provincias/cidade_de_maputo/hospital_central_de_maputo|url-status=dead|title=HOSPITAL CENTRAL DE MAPUTO (2011) Ministry of Health, Mozambique|archivedate=January 22, 2011}}</ref> The residence for the head of medicine is on the corner of ''Avenida Eduardo Mondlane'' and ''Avenida Salavador Allende''. It is a historically valuable structure which was completed in 1908 and has since the 1990s been converted into a charming restaurant with colonial themes called ''Restaurante 1908''. The upper floors are still used by the hospital as offices.
