== History ==
[[File:Philippine Island - Luzon Island - NARA - 68157101.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Tarlac, circa 1930s]]
[[File:Jose Rizal 1861-1896 Tarlak, Tarlak NHCP Historical Marker.png|upright|thumb|left|Historical marker of José Rizal's stay in "Tarlak" in 1892]]

Tarlac's first settlers came from [[Bacolor]], [[Pampanga]]. They cleared the area, fertilised the soil, and then established their settlement here in 1788. Tarlac's name is a Hispanized derivation from a ''talahib'' weed called ''tarlak'', an [[Aeta]] term.<ref name="tar">{{Cite book |last=Dizon |first=Lino A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBBxAAAAMAAJ |title=Tarlac and the Revolutionary Landscape: Essays on the Philippine Revolution from a Localized Perspective |publisher=Center for Tarlaqueño Studies, Tarlac State University |year=1997 |isbn=978-971-91488-1-4 |page=65}}</ref> The area around the current capital city was described as ''matarlak'' or ''malatarlak'', a word meaning "abundant with ''tarlak'' grass."<ref name="tar1">[http://lgu.pids.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_province&tabs=1&region_id=27 Resources for Local Governance – Tarlac] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820003007/http://lgu.pids.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_province&tabs=1&region_id=27 |date=August 20, 2011 }}</ref> This small community of settlers experienced rapid population growth, as settlers from [[Bataan]], [[Pampanga]] and [[Zambales]] moved into the area. The [[Kapampangan language]], which is the language of [[Pampanga]], became the native language of this town. Roads and barrios were built over the following decades through hard work of its residents. Following the foundation of the province of [[Tarlac]] in 1872, Tarlac was designated as the capital of the new province.

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
On June 21, 1969, President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] signed and approved the Republic Act 5907, converting this municipality into a city. However, its plebiscite was unsuccessful, showing their voters rejected cityhood.

On April 21, 1990, the barangays of Burgos, David, Iba, Labney, Lawacamulag, Lubigan, Maamot, Mababanaba, Moriones, Pao, San Juan de Valdez, Sula, and Villa Aglipay, originally part of the then-municipality of Tarlac, separated and formed to be the part of [[San Jose, Tarlac|San Jose]]. Tarlac now retains its 274.66&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (106.05 sq mi) area.

Finally, on March 12, 1998, Republic Act 8593 was signed by President [[Fidel V. Ramos]], making Tarlac as the component city of the province of [[Tarlac]]. On April 18, 1998, its residents approved the conversion of the municipality into a city. Tarlac was proclaimed as the component city by [[COMELEC]] on the next day, on April 19, 1998.

====Highly urbanized city====
On October 27, 2005, President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] signed the Proclamation No. 940, making Tarlac City into a highly urbanized city (HUC) in the province.<ref name="proc940">{{cite web| title=Proclamation No. 940, s. 2005 |url= https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2005/10/27/proclamation-no-940-s-2005-2/ |website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|date= October 27, 2005 }}</ref> However, the provincial government opposed the city's campaign for conversion into HUC.<ref>{{cite web| title=Several issues pertaining to the conversion of the City of Tarlac from a component city into a highly-urbanized city |url= https://dilg.gov.ph/legal-opinions/Several-issues-pertaining-to-the-conversion-of-the-City-of-Tarlac-from-a-component-city-into-a-highly-urbanized-city/471 |website=Department of the Interior and Local Government}}</ref> The majority of voters rejected the conversion in the plebiscite on February 11, 2006.
