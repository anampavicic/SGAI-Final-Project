'''Khanna''' is a city and a [[municipal council]] in the [[Ludhiana district]] of the Indian state of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]. It is well known for being Asia's largest [[grain trade|grain market]].<ref name="ti">{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20120131/ldh1.htm|title=Over 75% polling in Khanna, Samrala|date=31 January 2012|work=News in English|access-date=17 July 2012|agency=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]}}. KHANNA</ref><ref name="ti2">{{cite news | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20120117/ldh1.htm | title=khanna in need of major spruce-up | work=News in English | date=17 January 2012 | agency=The Tribune | access-date=17 July 2012}}</ref> It is a city which centers a national highway and buildings settled around a web of roads descending from National Highway to various State Highways to different Directions. It has a huge market place which attracts customers from all around the area, namely Guru Amardas Market.

== Toponymy ==
''Khanna'' is a [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] word, which means ''one quarter'' (1/4 or 0.25). The city was named thus because it used to be very small, just a quarter of what a normal city should be.

== History ==
Khanna has the largest grain market in [[Asia]],<ref name="lo">{{cite web |url=http://ludhiana.nic.in/admin/admin_mc_khanna.html |title=Khanna |website=ludhiana.nic.in |access-date=17 July 2012}}</ref> followed by the grain market of [[Rajpura]] ([[Punjab, India|Punjab]]). History reveals that [[Sher Shah Suri]] built a number of [[caravanserai|sarais]] (inns) at every 12 to 15 miles along the [[Delhi]]-[[Lahore]] road. One of the sarais was built in this area which is still known as the ''Purani Sarai''. After the decline of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule in the Punjab, [[Banda Bahadur]] captured the area from [[Sirhind]] to [[Hoshiarpur]]. After that a [[Jathedar]] of Dahedu controlled and occupied the whole of the area from Dahedu to [[Nabha]]. He married his daughter, Daya Kaur, to the King of Nabha. When a family dispute arose between the King and his new wife, she left Nabha for good and went back to live with her parents in Dahedu. According to Indian conventions she could not remain there forever. Therefore, her father gave her a "kann", or a "small portion", of the territory between Dahedu and Nabha that was well known for its agriculture. Over time, the pronunciation of the name changed from "Kann" to "Khanna".

The city is 40&nbsp;km from the city of [[Ludhiana]] on the [[Grand Trunk Road]] (National Highway 1) and is home to Asia's largest grain market. Its area is about 70&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.
