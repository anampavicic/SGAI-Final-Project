'''Münster''' ({{IPA|de|ˈmʏnstɐ|lang|De-Münster.ogg}}; {{lang-wep|Mönster}}) is an [[independent city#Germany|independent city]] (''Kreisfreie Stadt'') in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]]. It is in the northern part of the state and is considered to be the cultural centre of the [[Westphalia]] region. It is also a [[Münster (region)|state district]] capital. Münster was the location of the [[Münster Rebellion|Anabaptist rebellion]] during the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the site of the signing of the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] ending the [[Thirty Years' War]] in 1648. Today, it is known as the bicycle capital of Germany.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Münster bicycle capital |url=https://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?204445/Munster-bicycle-capital |access-date=2024-02-21 |website=wwf.panda.org |language=en}}</ref>

In 1534, an apocalyptic [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] sect, led by [[John of Leiden]], took power in the [[Münster rebellion]] and founded a democratic proto-socialistic state. They claimed all property, burned all books except the Bible, and called it the "New Jerusalem". John of Leiden believed he would lead the elect from Münster to capture the entire world and purify it of evil with the sword in preparation for the [[Second Coming of Christ]] and the beginning of the Millennium. They went so far as to require all citizens to be naked as preparation for the Second Coming. However, the town was recaptured in 1535; the Anabaptists were tortured to death and their corpses were exhibited in metal baskets, which can still be seen hanging from the tower of [[St Lambert's Church, Münster|St. Lambert's Church]].<ref name="Münster793-1800"/>

Part of the signing of the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648 was held in Münster.<ref name="Münsterhistory">{{cite web |title=A foray into town history |url=http://www.muenster.de/stadt/tourismus/en/history.html |publisher=Stadt Münster |access-date=20 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927112504/http://www.muenster.de/stadt/tourismus/en/history.html |archive-date=27 September 2011}}</ref> This ended the [[Thirty Years' War]] and the [[Eighty Years' War]].<ref name="Münsterhistory"/> It also guaranteed the future of the prince-bishop and the diocese; the area was to be exclusively [[Roman Catholic]].

The last outstanding palace of the German baroque period, the [[Schloss Münster]], was created according to plans by [[Johann Conrad Schlaun]].<ref name="Münster793-1800"/> The [[University of Münster]] (called "Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster", WWU, between 1907 and 2023) was established in 1780. It is now a major European centre for excellence in education and research with large faculties in the arts, humanities, theology, sciences, business and law. Currently there are about 40,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students enrolled.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In 1802 Münster was conquered by [[Prussia]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It was also part of the [[Grand Duchy of Berg]] between 1806 and 1811 and the [[Lippe (department)|Lippe]] department of the [[First French Empire]] between 1811 and 1813, before returning to Prussian rule. It became the capital of the Prussian [[province of Westphalia]]. In 1899 the city's harbour started operations when the city was linked to the [[Dortmund-Ems Canal]].

===World War II===

In the 1940s the Bishop of Münster, Cardinal [[Clemens August Graf von Galen]], was one of the most prominent critics of the Nazi government. In retaliation for his success (''[[The New York Times]]'' described Bishop von Galen as "the most obstinate opponent of the National Socialist anti-Christian program"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.30giorni.it/us/articolo.asp?id=4292 |title=The Lion of Münster and Pius XII |website=30Days |access-date=20 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019185006/http://www.30giorni.it/us/articolo.asp?id=4292 |archive-date=19 October 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), Münster was heavily garrisoned during World War II, and five large complexes of barracks are still a feature of the city. Münster was the headquarters (Hauptsitz) for the 6th Military District (Wehrkreis) of the German Wehrmacht, under the command of Infantry General (General der Infanterie) [[Gerhard Glokke]]. Originally made up of [[Westphalia]] and the [[Rhineland]], after the [[Battle of France]] it was expanded to include the [[Eupen]] – [[Malmedy]] district of [[Belgium]]. The headquarters controlled military operations in Münster, [[Essen]], [[Düsseldorf]], [[Wuppertal]], [[Bielefeld]], [[Coesfeld]], [[Paderborn]], [[Herford]], [[Minden]], [[Detmold]], [[Lingen]], [[Osnabrück]], [[Recklinghausen]], [[Gelsenkirchen]], and [[Cologne]].

Münster was the home station for the [[VI Corps (Germany)|VI]] and [[XXIII Corps (Germany)|XXIII Infantry Corps]] (Armeekorps), as well as the XXXIII and LVI [[Panzerkorps]]. Münster was also the home of the [[1st Light Division (Germany)|6th]], [[16th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|16th]] and [[25th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|25th Panzer Division]]; the [[16th Panzergrenadier Division (Germany)|16th]] [[Panzergrenadier]] Division; and the [[6th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|6th]], [[26th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|26th]], [[69th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|69th]], [[86th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|86th]], [[106th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|106th]], [[126th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|126th]], [[196th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|196th]], [[199th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|199th]], [[211th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|211th]], [[227th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|227th]], [[253rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|253rd]], [[254th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|254th]], [[264th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|264th]], [[306th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|306th]], [[326th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|326th]], [[329th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|329th]], [[336th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|336th]], [[371st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|371st]], [[385th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|385th]], and [[716th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|716th]] Infantry Divisions (Infanterie-division).

==Geography==

===Geographic position===
[[File:EinzugdesGesandten AdriaenPauw.jpg|thumb|[[Gerard ter Borch]]: Dutch envoy [[Adriaan Pauw]] enters Münster around 1646 for the peace negotiations resulting in the [[Peace of Westphalia]] (Stadtmuseum Münster)]]
Münster is situated on the river [[Münstersche Aa|Aa]], approximately {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=off}} south of its confluence with the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] in the so-called [[Westphalian Lowland|Westphalian Bight]], a landscape studded with dispersed settlements and farms – the "Münsterland". The [[Wolstonian Stage|Wolstonian]] [[Sedimentary rock|sediments]] of the mountain ridge called "Münsterländer Kiessandzug" cross the city from north to south. The highest elevation is the Mühlenberg in the northwest of Münster, 97&nbsp;metres [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The lowest elevation is at the Ems, 44&nbsp;m [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The city centre is 60&nbsp;m above sea level, measured at the [[Prinzipalmarkt]] in front of the historic city hall.

The Dutch city of [[Enschede]] lies about {{convert|65|km|0|abbr=on}} northwest of Münster. Other major cities nearby include [[Osnabrück]], about {{convert|44|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north, [[Dortmund]], about {{convert|61|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south, and [[Bielefeld]], about {{convert|62|km|0|abbr=on}} to the east.

Münster is one of the 42 [[Urban agglomeration|agglomeration areas]] and one of Germany's biggest cities in terms of area. But it includes substantial sparsely-populated rural districts which were formerly separate local government authorities until they were [[Amalgamation (politics)|amalgamated]] in 1975. Thus nearly half the city's area is agricultural, resulting in a low population-density of approximately 900 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>.
[[File:ModellMünster.jpg|thumb|Bronze model of Münster's city centre]]
[[File:A picture of the Aasee.jpg|thumb|Münster's Lake Aa]]

===Population density===
The city's built-up area is quite extensive. There are no skyscrapers and few high-rise buildings but very many detached houses and mansions. Still the population density reaches about 15,000 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup> in the city centre.<ref>{{cite web |author=Amt für Stadtentwicklung, Stadtplanung, Verkehrsplanung |url=http://www.muenster.de/stadt/stadtplanung/pdf/Darstellung_Stadtbezirke_Stadtteile_Stadtzellen_mit_Bevoelkerungsdichte_2005.pdf |title=Map of population density in the statistical areas |publisher=Stadt Münster}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, page 2</ref> Calculating the population density based on the actual populated area results in approximately 2890 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>.<ref>[http://www.statlas.nrw.de Regional statistics for NRW] of Landesamt für Datenverarbeitung und Statistik Nordrhein-Westfalen</ref>{{verify source|date=March 2018}}

===Climate===
A well-known saying in Münster is ''"Entweder es regnet oder es läuten die Glocken. Und wenn beides zusammen fällt, dann ist Sonntag"'' ("Either it rains or the church bells ring. And if both occur at the same time, it's Sunday."), but in reality the rainfall with approximately {{convert|758|mm|1|abbr=in}} per year is close to the average rainfall in Germany.<ref name=weatherDE/> The perception of Münster as a rain-laden city isn't caused by the absolute amount of rainfall but by the above-average number of rainy days with relatively small amounts of rainfall. The average temperature is {{convert|9.4|C|F|1}} with approximately 1500 sun hours per year.<ref name=weatherDE>{{cite web |url=http://kli.uni-muenster.de/de/weather/climate/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506093750/http://kli.uni-muenster.de/de/weather/climate/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 May 2006 |title=Klima in Münster |date=21 February 2006 |access-date=27 January 2010 |website=kli }}</ref> Consequently, Münster is in the bottom fifth in comparison with other German cities. The winter in Münster is fairly mild and [[snowfall]] is unusual. The temperature during summertime meets the average in Germany. The highest daily rainfall was registered on 28 July 2014: One weather station of the MeteoGroup reported a rainfall of {{convert|122.2|L/m2|abbr=on}}; the State Environment Agency registered at one of its stations {{convert|292|L/m2|abbr=on}} during seven hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unwetterzentrale.de/uwz/958.html |title=Unwetterlage Deutschland Ende Juli 2014 – Extremregen in Münster |publisher=Unwetterzentral |access-date=22 March 2017}}</ref> The record rainfall led to severe flooding throughout the city and the nearby [[Greven]].

===Adjacent cities and districts===
Münster borders on the following cities and municipalities, named clockwise and beginning in the northwest: [[Altenberge]] and [[Greven]] ([[Steinfurt (district)|District of Steinfurt]]), [[Telgte]], [[Everswinkel]], [[Sendenhorst]] and [[Drensteinfurt]] ([[Warendorf (district)|District of Warendorf]]), as well as [[Ascheberg]], [[Senden]] and [[Havixbeck]] ([[Coesfeld (district)|District of Coesfeld]]).

===City boroughs===
[[File:Muenster (Westfalen) Stadtbezirke.png|thumb|Münster administrative districts. The darker parts represent the built-up areas of the city.]]

The city is divided into six administrative districts or [[Stadtbezirk]]e: "Mitte" (Middle), "Nord" (North), "Ost" (East), "West", "Süd-Ost" (South-East) and "Hiltrup". Each district is represented by a council of 19 representatives elected in local elections. Heading each council is the district mayor, or ''Bezirksvorsteher''. Every district is subdivided into residential quarters (''Wohnbereiche''). This official term, however, is not used in common speech, as there are no discrete definitions of the individual quarters. The term "Stadtteil" is used instead, mainly referring to the incorporated communities. The districts are also divided into 45 statistical districts.

The following list names each district with its residential and additional quarters. These are the official names, which partly differ from the usage in common speech.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hauptsatzung der Stadt Münster vom 21.12.1995 |language=de |url=http://www5.stadt-muenster.de/ortsrecht/dokumente/10_01.pdf |trans-title=Main constitution of the city of Münster on 21 December 1995 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409035848/http://www5.stadt-muenster.de/ortsrecht/dokumente/10_01.pdf |archive-date=9 April 2008}}</ref>

Münster has a population of about 320,000 people. It is the 10th largest city in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and the 20th largest city in Germany. It is also the seventh largest German city by area at {{convert|303.28|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and serves as the center of the [[Münster (region)|Münster region]] (known as Münsterland in German). Considered one of the oldest German cities, Münster has been a major city since approximately 1000 AD. It first reached 100,000 inhabitants in 1948, and the population has continued to grow since the 1980s due to the popularity of the local university. Münster is also known for its bicycles, and some estimates suggest it has more bicycles than people. The city reached a population of 300,000 in 2014.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

=== Representation ===
Münster forms its own [[Münster (electoral district)|Electoral district]] (No. 129) for elections on a national level. Due to [[Electoral system of Germany|Germany's mixture of a direct and a proportional electoral system]] Münster sends a directly elected member into the [[Bundestag]] as well as other politicians have the chance to qualify via their [[Electoral list|party's state-wide list]]. As for the [[2021 German federal election]] health politician [[Maria Klein-Schmeink]] ([[Alliance 90/The Greens|The Greens]]) won the districts seat in the Bundestag with 32.3% of the personal vote.<ref name="bundeswahlleiter.de">{{Cite web |title=Ergebnisse Münster – Der Bundeswahlleiter |url=https://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/bundestagswahlen/2021/ergebnisse/bund-99/land-5/wahlkreis-129.html |access-date=2022-04-12 |website=www.bundeswahlleiter.de}}</ref> Defeated candidates, former member of the [[Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia]]<ref>{{Cite web |last=vCardvCard |date=2021-07-19 |title=Dr. Stefan Nacke |url=https://www.cdu-nrw.de/dr-stefan-nacke |access-date=2022-04-12 |website=CDU Nordrhein-Westfalen |language=de}}</ref> [[Stefan Nacke]] ([[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]/26.2%)<ref name="bundeswahlleiter.de"/> and former [[Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection|environment minister]] [[Svenja Schulze]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]/24.1%) both became members of the [[20th Bundestag]] via their parties' lists.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gewählte in Landeslisten der Parteien in Nordrhein-Westfalen – Der Bundeswahlleiter |url=https://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/bundestagswahlen/2021/gewaehlte/bund-99/land-5.html |access-date=2022-04-12 |website=www.bundeswahlleiter.de}}</ref> Svenja Schulze entered the new [[Scholz cabinet]] regaining a position as minister, this time in the [[Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Svenja Schulze |url=https://www.bmz.de/de/ministerium/leitung/schulze-99772 |access-date=2022-04-12 |website=Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung |language=de}}</ref>

On the state level Münster was divided into two constituencies up until the [[2017 North Rhine-Westphalia state election]]. The election system of state elections mirrors that of national elections. During the legislative period of [[Laschet cabinet]] redistricting resulted in Münster now being split up into three constituencies, two of which now also include some surrounding [[Municipality|municipalities]]. The 2017 election saw both CDU candidates Stefan Nacke and Simone Wendland winning their seat via the constituency.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Landtagswahl 2017 |url=https://www.stadt-muenster.de/ms/wahlen/ergebnis/app/ltw2017.html |access-date=2022-04-12 |website=www.stadt-muenster.de}}</ref> Via party lists [[Svenja Schulze]] (SPD) and Josefine Paul (The Greens) entered the Landtag.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Landtagswahl 2017 in NRW |url=https://www.wahlergebnisse.nrw/landtagswahlen/2017/index.shtml |access-date=2022-04-12 |website=www.wahlergebnisse.nrw}}</ref> After Nacke and Schulze both changed into federal politics, Münster is left with only two representatives in the Landtag.

==Economy==
Greater Münster is home to many industries such as those of public authorities, consulting companies, insurance companies, banks, computer centres, publishing houses, advertising and design.<ref name="MünsterEconomy">{{cite web |title=Economic location |url=http://www.muenster.de/en/economic_location.php |publisher=Stadt Münster |access-date=15 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927112246/http://www.muenster.de/en/economic_location.php |archive-date=27 September 2011}}</ref> The service sector has created several thousand jobs.<ref name="MünsterEconomy"/> Retailers have approximately 1.9&nbsp;billion euro turnover.<ref name="MünsterEconomy"/> The city still has traditional merchants' townhouses as well as modern outlets.<ref name="MünsterEconomy"/>

==Entrepreneurship==
Münster's wealth was underpinned by wealthy merchant families such as the Merfelders,  Rüschkamps, and Berens.
Berens Bank was founded in 1630 in Münster, Germany, by '''Hermann Berens'''. Berens was a successful merchant and banker, and he founded the bank to provide financial services to other businesses and individuals in the city.
The Berens family lived in a large house on Roggenmarkt, known as the Berenshof. The Berens interests inclused textiles and grain.

The job market situation in Münster is "comparatively good".<ref>{{cite web |title=Job market |url=http://www.muenster.de/en/job_market.php |publisher=Stadt Münster |access-date=20 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927112441/http://www.muenster.de/en/job_market.php |archive-date=27 September 2011}}</ref> Of the approximately 130,000 employees subject to social insurance contribution more than 80% work in the [[tertiary sector]], about 17% work in the [[secondary sector]] and 1% work in the [[primary sector]].<ref name=Stat2006/>{{rp|95}}
