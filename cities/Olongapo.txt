==History==
<!--NOTE: British invasion from 1762 to 1764 only affects the city of Manila. See article: British occupation of Manila, where the Wikipedia article doesn't even mention Olongapo even once.
===British period===
Britain ruled the Philippines for a short time, from 1762 to 1764. The British invasion of the Philippines was the first challenge to Spain's control of the archipelago after 191 years of rule. The Royal Navy and British Army joined with the East India Company in Madras to capture Spain's Asian colony.

In conjunction with the attack against Spain's key possession in the Americas, Havana, both settlements were successfully seized. However, in the Philippines, whilst the expedition was launched as part of a plan to harass the Spaniards in their possessions, as well as for commercial gain and new territories, the military campaign led by General [[William Draper (British Army officer)|William Draper]] and Admiral [[Sir Samuel Cornish, 1st Baronet|Samuel Cornish]], may have been launched under the guise of an invasion in order to gain prize money.

The publication ''When Britain Ruled the Philippines 1762–1764'' describes the events as they unfolded at the Admiralty in London and at the East India Company in Madras, leading to the invasion and occupation of the capital city of Manila and the port city of Cavite. The capital was looted, a galleon was seized, and the British commanders imposed a ransom of four million dollars upon the Spaniards. The enormous sums in prize money and valuables seized mainly benefited the commanders.
-->

===Spanish colonial era===
In 1868, a Spanish military expedition was dispatched to study the possibility of relocating the Cavite Naval Station in Subic Bay due to its unhealthy condition.

Spanish [[King Alfonso XII]] through a Royal Decree made Subic Bay (then called Subig) as Spain's stronghold in the Far East in 1884. Vice Admiral Juan Bautista de Antiquiera made Olongapo a settlement for the Spanish Navy.

On March 8, 1885, the [[Spanish Navy|Spanish Naval]] commission authorized construction of the Arsenal in Olongapo. The Spanish planned to transform their naval station and the village of Olongapo into an island, safeguarding it from potential rebel attacks. The Spanish Navy Yard occupied the entire area east of the Spanish Gate. Employing Filipino labor, they did extensive dredging of the harbor and the inner basin and built a drainage canal.  The canal served both to drain the swampy area around the yard and also to form a line of defense.

Within ten years, the Spaniards had erected walls and markers to fence off the arsenal. They had shops and buildings erected. The Spanish government spent almost fifteen years developing the naval station. From higher naval commands, the order was sent to fortify Grande Island at the mouth of Subic Bay name=historyspain1>{{cite web|url= http://olongapo-subic.com/olongapo_city_subic_bay_zambales_museum_history.htm|title= History of Subic Bay and Olongapo City|access-date= December 13, 2011|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120313035911/http://olongapo-subic.com/olongapo_city_subic_bay_zambales_museum_history.htm|archive-date= March 13, 2012|url-status= dead}}</ref><ref name=historyspain2>{{cite web|url= http://www.subicbaypi.com/sub_stories_olongapostory.htm|title= The Olongapo Story}}</ref><ref name=historyspain3>{{cite web|url= http://olongapo-city-philippines.blogspot.com/2009/11/olongapo-city-barangay-and-history.html|title= Olongapo City Barangay and History|date= November 14, 2009}}</ref><ref name=historyspain4>{{cite web|url= http://www.olongapocity.gov.ph/History.html&client=firefox-a|title= History of Olongapo City}}{{dead link|date=February 2024|bot=medic}}</ref> In the meantime, during the Philippine Revolution, a fleet led by the Cuban-Filipino Admiral [[Vicente Catalan]] seized the naval base at Subic-Olongapo from the Spanish for the [[First Philippine Republic]].

===American occupation===
[[File:Aerial view Olangapo Naval Station 1928 NARA 19-LC-19C.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the Olongapo Naval Station in 1928]]
On May 1, 1898, the construction of the Spanish Administration Building was nearly complete when Admiral Dewey's flagship, {{USS|Olympia|C-6|6}}, led the [[Asiatic Fleet]] into [[Manila Bay]]. A detachment of Dewey's fleet bombarded the navy yard. Eventually, after the surrender, Spain relinquished all her rights in the Philippines to the United States. This marked the end of more than three hundred years of Spanish rule over the islands.

Realizing the tremendous importance of Olongapo as a naval facility, the U.S. Navy decided to keep the base in functioning order; US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], on November 9, 1901, by executive order, reserved the waters of Subic and some of the adjacent lands for naval purposes.

The naval station was widened and with the establishment of the American rule in the Philippines. American defenses in the islands were facilities left by the Spanish Navy which were taken over by the United States.

Olongapo grew in direct proportion to the growth of the naval station. More people came to live in Olongapo since the Navy offered employment. To most Filipinos during that time, it was a welcome change. The promise of a different kind of experience as shop workers and office help induced many young men to leave their farms and fishing boats to work in the Navy Yard. Others finding the lure of the sea irresistible joined the U.S. Navy.

Olongapo impressed its visitors as being one of the finest communities in the country. People passing through the town never failed to comment on its cleanliness and orderliness.<ref name=historyspain1>{{cite web|url= http://olongapo-subic.com/olongapo_city_subic_bay_zambales_museum_history.htm|title= History of Subic Bay and Olongapo City|access-date= December 13, 2011|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120313035911/http://olongapo-subic.com/olongapo_city_subic_bay_zambales_museum_history.htm|archive-date= March 13, 2012|url-status= dead}}</ref><ref name=historyspain2 />

===Japanese occupation ===
When the war broke out in 1941, the old town was obliterated.  Olongapo was twice destroyed.

On December 14, 1941, Japanese bombers attacked the Olongapo/Subic Bay area. Ten days later, the order was given to burn Subic Bay Naval Station and withdraw. Olongapo was set aflame by the Filipinos in anticipation of the Japanese arrival.  The USS ''[[USS New York (ACR-2)|New York]]'' was scuttled in Subic Bay.<ref>[http://www.subicbaypi.com/subic_timeline40.htm Subic Bay History – 1940's]. Subicbaypi.com (April 8, 1942). Retrieved on July 28, 2013.</ref> When the American forces made a last-ditch stand on the [[Bataan]] peninsula, the Naval Station was abandoned and most of its facilities were burned before the Japanese came.

In 1945, Olongapo was again bombed, shelled and burned. Joint American and Philippine Commonwealth ground troops aided guerrilla fighters in liberating Olongapo from the Japanese forces. With the exceptions of the Station Chapel (the Olongapo Parish Church before the war) and the Spanish Gate, none of its former landmarks withstood the war. The general headquarters between the [[United States Army]], [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] & [[Philippine Constabulary]] were located in Olongapo during and after [[World War II]], and were active until 1946 after operating against the Japanese for the liberation of [[Central Luzon]].

===Postwar Era===
In 1946, the Philippines was granted independence. Olongapo was one of the principal naval bases retained by the United States. The Navy started rebuilding the town after hostilities ceased. Olongapo was built on a new undeveloped site a couple of miles north of its former location. The prewar town site became part of the base.

The first few years after the war were difficult for the new town, as everything in the new Olongapo was damaged. There were no electric power and no drainage system. The water supply and sanitation facilities were inadequate, and streets were unpaved.<ref name=historyspain2 /> Gradually, Olongapo evolved into a new community: new businesses were established, housing projects were planned and civic facilities were restored.

During the [[Korean War]], the United States spent over {{US$|170 million}} to convert the base into the homeport of the Navy's Seventh Fleet, developing the Cubi Naval Air Station as the largest US installation of its kind in Asia. Naval authorities relocated the residence from the area of the former Public Works Center area to the intersection of what is now known as Rizal Avenue and Ramon Magsaysay Drive, and in the Barangays New Asinan and New Kalalake areas. Zoning of Olongapo was patterned after American practice where streets are constructed along straight lines. The magnitude of facilities construction in the Olongapo and Subic Bay area brought growth and prosperity to Olongapo. By 1956, migrants from nearby towns and provinces had swelled the population to 39,180.<ref name=history5>{{cite web|url= http://www.olongapocity.gov.ph/?page_id=219|title= World War II |work= Olongapo City Official Website}}</ref>

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
[[File:Olongapo and bridge leading to NS Subic Bay.jpg|thumb|Bridge leading to NS Subic Bay, 1981]]

Unlike the rest of the Philippines which gained independence from the United States after [[World War II]] in 1946, Olongapo was governed as a part of the United States naval reservation. The Subic Bay Naval Base commanding officer was chairman of the Olongapo town council, school board, and hospital board. Olongapo's 60,000 Filipino residents paid taxes to the US Navy and those accused of crimes involving American servicemen were tried in US Navy courts. In July 1955, Manila mayor [[Arsenio Lacson]] announced that American service personnel accused of crimes in Manila would be tried in Philippine courts because of US Navy abuses of Filipinos in Olongapo.

On October 23, 1959, Olongapo was placed under [[martial law]] when Robert Grant, the American owner of an Olongapo auto parts store was killed and the US Navy declined to identify or try the Naval Supply Depot sentry who shot him.<ref name="mtp">Anderson, Gerald ''Subic Bay from Magellan to Pinatubo: The History of the U.S. Naval Station Subic Bay'' Gerald Anderson (2009); {{ISBN|1441444521}} pp. 130–138</ref>

=== Mount Pinatubo eruption ===
{{main|1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo}}

[[File:Ash from Mount Pinatubo covers NS Subic Bay.jpg|thumb|Mount Pinatubo ash covers Naval Station Subic Bay]]

On June 15, 1991, [[Mount Pinatubo]], {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=off}} from the city, violently erupted with a force eight times greater than the May 1980 eruption of [[Mount St. Helens]]. Volcanic clouds blocked out the sun. Volcanic earthquakes and heavy muddy rain, as well as thunderstorms from a typhoon passing over Central Luzon, darkened the area for 36 hours in what would become known as "Black Saturday".<ref name=history4>{{cite web|url= http://www.olongapocity.gov.ph/?page_id=234|title= Twin Disasters- Olongapo City Official Website}}</ref>
This caused widespread damage to the United States facility and Olongapo City.

On September 16, 1991, the Senate leaders of the Philippines did not grant an extension of the existing RP-US Military Bases Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States, thus terminating the stay of the United States military in the Philippines.

===Contemporary era===
[[File:US Flag lowered and Philippine flag raised during turnover of NS Subic Bay.jpg|thumb|The U.S. flag is lowered and Philippine flag is raised during turnover of Naval Station Subic Bay.]]

Olongapo surged to national prominence during the incumbency of Mayor [[Richard Gordon (politician)|Richard Gordon]], who, like his father before him, was against the departure of US military forces, yet lobbied for the turnover of the facility and its conversion into a freeport in 1992. Gordon spearheaded a volunteerism strategy to return an ailing economy to prosperity after Mount Pinatubo's eruption and the withdrawal of US forces. The strategy worked across all demographics and involved a strong corps of 8,000 volunteers who protected and preserved the abandoned base facilities from poachers. Gordon complemented this with an aggressive advocacy campaign to convert the area into a protected area and industrial zone. Later, he launched an aggressive international investment promotion which resulted in the accelerating the development of a prime industrial and tourism zone in the country, the [[Subic Bay Freeport Zone]] (SBFZ).<ref name=history4 />

As the first chartered city and highly urbanized city in its province, Olongapo's reputation among Filipinos rose from being a "sin city" in the 1960s and 1970s into a "model city" in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s.<ref name=history3 />

A recent racial study showed that Angeles City, Pampanga; alongside Manila; and Olongapo, Zambales; was the locations of several concentrations of 250,000 [[Amerasians]] (Mixed American-Asians) who were born as a result of the American colonization of the Philippines and the presence of US bases in the country.<ref>{{Cite press release |title=200,000–250,000 or More Military Filipino Amerasians Alive Today in Republic of the Philippines according to USA-RP Joint Research Paper Finding |date=November 5, 2012 |url=http://amerasianresearch.org/releases/amerasianresearch-2012-09.pdf |access-date=July 11, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101212827/http://amerasianresearch.org/releases/amerasianresearch-2012-09.pdf |archive-date=November 1, 2013 |work=Amerasian Research Network, Ltd.}}</ref><ref>{{#invoke:cite web||type=Academic paper presented at 9th International Conference on the Philippines (ICOPHIL-9) |last1=Kutschera |first1=P.

=== Public Utilities ===

==== Electricity ====
Electricity services were formerly provided by the government-run Public Utilities Department (PUD) since the city was founded. However, in the late 2000s, the city faced debt in its electricity distribution costs amounting to P5 billion to power suppliers and threatened to cut the city from the Luzon power grid. Then Mayor James Gordon Jr. also attributed the crisis to low collection rate due to nonpayment or debts incurred by consumers, widespread energy theft and corruption in the PUD. The situation worsened because of interests imposed by Private Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corp. (PSALM), the refusal of the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) to grant an increase in power rates, and the years of delay in the PUD's privatization.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/451401/olongapos-power-debt-burden|title=Olongapo's power debt burden|last=Gonzaga|first=Robert|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|access-date=July 3, 2016}}</ref>

In 2013, through Republic Act No. 10373, the PUD was sold for Php 610 million to [[Olongapo Electricity Distribution Company]] (OEDC), an affiliate of Cagayan Electric Power and Light Company (CEPALCO), which was given a 25-year franchise to take over the city's power distributor. The company has since upgraded the city's obsolete and dilapidated distribution network and has made significant improvements to the city's electricity services.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/371899/aquino-signs-law-on-olongapo-power-privatization|title=Aquino signs law on Olongapo power privatization|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|access-date=July 3, 2016}}</ref>

==== Water ====
Water services are provided by Subic Water and Sewerage Company (also known as Subic Water. Not to be confused with Subic Water District (SWD), which is a different water distribution company serving the neighboring towns of Subic, Zambales.). In 2013, the city's shares in Subic Water has been sold to [[Maynilad Water Services|Maynilad Water Services Inc.]] (Maynilad) to continue modernizing the city's water utilities services.<ref>{{Cite news|work=Rappler|url=http://www.rappler.com/business/24592-olongapo-sells-10-of-subic-water-to-maynilad|title=Olongapo sells 10% of Subic Water to Maynilad|access-date=July 3, 2016}}</ref> In March 2016, this was reversed and the city has bought back its shares because the city wanted to have a representation in Subic Water because the city's constituents accounted for the majority of Subic Water's customers.
