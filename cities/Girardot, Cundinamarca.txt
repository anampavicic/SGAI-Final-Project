'''Girardot''' is a municipality and town of [[Colombia]] in the [[Departments of Colombia|department]] of [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]]. It is the second most important city of Cundinamarca according to its production. It is home to a number of recreational and vacational spots, mainly visited by people from [[Bogotá]], as it is located at two hours drive from the city but enjoys a [[tropical climate]] (compared to the cold and rainy climate of Bogotá). The municipality had a population of 109,792 (2020 estimate),<ref>[http://www.citypopulation.de/en/colombia/admin/cundinamarca/25307__girardot/ Citypopulation.de] Population of Girardot municipality</ref> and form a small metropolitan area together with the neighbouring municipalities of [[Flandes]] and [[Ricaurte, Cundinamarca|Ricaurte]].

== History ==
In pre-Columbian times the municipality of Girardot was inhabited by a tribe of Indians called the “[[Panches]]” whose origins are unknown.  The municipality began with the hamlet of “La Chivatera” (the goat farm) because it was very common in the area to raise goats.  The hamlet was located in the jurisdiction of the municipality of Tocaima, of which documents exist dated 1840 calling it “paso de Flandes” (step of Flanders).  Through the aforementioned hamlet runs the Magdalena river moving southwest towards the center of the country.

Due to its strategic position the area experienced steady growth, and thanks to the donation of land by Ramón Bueno and José Triana, the municipality was officially founded with the name of Girardot, in honor of General [[Atanasio Girardot]].  This was documented in the ordinance 20 on October 9, 1852 that says “… create a parish district with the name of Girardot…”.  The first mayor of the district was named Claudio Clavijo.  The parish was created in 1866 (reviewed by the [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] Gazette No 407 of July 7, 1891), and was the first parish of priest José Marcelino Pardo.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of Colombia|last=María|first=Jesús|publisher=University of North Carolina|year=1938|location=Chapel Hill|pages=1}}</ref>

The city began to develop in a grid pattern centered on San Miguel square, where a cathedral of the same name is located; whose architecture resembles that of the region.

The first hotel in the city was built in 1884 to accommodate the constant flow of travelers and merchants and was named the Cisneros Hotel.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Lo que no sabías de Girardot|date=9 April 2013|work=Extra Girardot: El Diario de Todos}}</ref>  Two years after the hotel was finished the population of the port was recorded as 2,163.  As a result of the [[Thousand Days' War]] a large number of liberal refugees from the south and east of [[Tolima Department|Tolima]] settled on land in the area.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Azcarate|first=Camilo|title=Psychosocial Dynamics of the Armed Conflict in Colombia|journal=Journal of Peace and Conflict Resolution}}</ref>

==Geography==
The municipality lies on a plain, framed by the foothills of the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Cordillera Oriental]], without notable topographic features, with some areas of difficult access in the mountainous area on the border with [[Nariño, Cundinamarca|Nariño]] called Alonso Vera cordillera.<ref name="IUP" />
