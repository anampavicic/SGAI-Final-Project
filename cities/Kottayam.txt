'''Kottayam''' ({{IPA-ml|ko:ʈ:ayam|IPA}}) is a [[city]] in the [[Kottayam district]] of [[Kerala]], [[India]]. It is the district headquarters of the district and is located about {{convert|151|km|1|abbr=on}} north of the state capital [[Thiruvananthapuram]]. As per the [[2011 Indian census]], Kottayam has a population of 489,615 people, and a population density of {{convert|4533|/sqkm|abbr=on}}. The total Kottayam [[Metropolitan area]] (the combined area of Kottayam municipality and its adjacent suburbs) has a population of 802,419 people, and a population density of {{convert|3647|/sqkm|abbr=on}}.

Kottayam is also referred to as "the City of Letters" as many of the first [[Malayalam]] daily newspapers, such as ''[[Deepika (newspaper)|Deepika]],'' ''[[Malayala Manorama]],'' and ''[[Mangalam Publications|Mangalam]],'' were started and are headquartered in Kottayam, as are a number of publishing houses.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

==Etymology==
The royal palace of the [[Thekkumkur]] ruler was protected by a fort called ''Thaliyilkotta''. It is believed that the name ''Kottayam'' is derived from a combination of the [[Malayalam]] words ''kotta'' which means fort (''Thaliyilkotta'') and ''akam'' which means inside. The combined form, ''Kottaykkakam'' (കോട്ടയ്ക്കകം), can be translated as "inside the fort".<ref name="About Kottayam">{{Cite web|date=3 April 2020|title=About Kottayam|url=https://kottayam.nic.in/history/|access-date=9 April 2020|website=Kottayam}}</ref><ref name="Kurien">{{cite thesis |last=Kurien |first=Lucyamma |date=May 2000 |chapter-url= http://ietd.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/354/2/11_chapter4.pdf |title=The structure and functioning of gram sabhas: a study focussed on the district of Kottayam|chapter=Chapter IV: The functioning of gram sabha: General Features |publisher=Mahatma Gandhi University |pages=116–206}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Kottayam District |quote=Kottayam is a compound word- kotta+akam which means the interior of a fort.

==History==
=== Thekkumkur rule (1103 - 1753) ===
{{Main|Thekkumkur}}

From the beginning of the ninth century AD, the history of [[Thekkumkur]] and of Kottayam are virtually indistinguishable. Kottayam was then a part of Vempolinad, an area in the [[Venad|Kulashekara Empire]] (800 AD – 1103&nbsp; AD). By 1103, the Kingdom of Vempolinad had split into the Kingdoms of Thekkumkur and [[Vadakkumkur]], and the latter became a vassal of [[Kochi|Cochin]].<ref name="ReferenceA">P. Shungoonny Menon - A HISTORY OF TRAVANCORE - First edition: 1878, New edition: 1983, Page 130, 131 - {{ISBN|978-8170200406}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=K.N Gopala Pillai Kuruppum Veettil|title=Thekkumkur Rani (Queen of Thekkumkur) |url=https://archive.org/details/ThekkumkoorRani/page/n7 |access-date=2 December 2019|year=1948|publisher=The Hindustan Publishing House, Trivandrum, Publisher: Thomas George BA|pages=224–}}</ref>

The royal house had originally been situated in Vennimala in Kottayam. It was protected by a fort known as Thaliyilkotta and, as a result, the locality came to be known by the same name as the fort. Afterward, Thekkumkur kings shifted their capital to Nattassery near Kumaranallore at the outskirts of Kottayam town. It is believed that the Thekkumkur dynasty ruled Kottayam from Thazhathangadi. Rulers of Munjanad and Thekkumkur had their headquarters at Thazhathangadi in the present Kottayam town. Marthanda Varma of Travancore attacked Thekkumkur and destroyed the palace and the Thaliyil fort. The remnants of the palaces and forts are still seen here.

The [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] and the [[Dutch India|Dutch]] established trade relations with both of these kingdoms, dealing in black pepper and other spices. After the subjugation of the Dutch East India Company by the Kingdom of [[Travancore]] in the 1741 [[Travancore–Dutch War]], military operations of [[Marthanda Varma]] progressed against the northern neighboring kingdoms, including Thekkumkur.

===Travancore rule (1753 - 1949)===
{{Main|Travancore}}
Though Thekkumkur allied with Chempakassery and Vadakkumkoor to protect the kingdom, all of them were finally annexed to Travancore.<ref>{{cite book|author=A. Sreedhara Menon|title=Political History of Modern Kerala|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wnAjqjhc1VcC&pg=PA140|access-date=10 August 2012|year=1987|publisher=D C Books|isbn=978-81-264-2156-5|pages=140–}}</ref> Another source states that the ruler of Thekkumkur had sided first with the [[Odanad|Kingdom of Kayamkulam]] and then with the principality of [[Ambalapuzha]] against Travancore. After the fall of Ambalapuzha, and as the ruler of Thekkumkur refused to come to terms with Travancore, his capital city was taken on 11 September 1750 by [[Ramayyan Dalawa]], the general and prime minister of Marthanda Varma, and the state was annexed to Travancore in 1753.

By the early 19th century, Travancore became a Protectorate of Britain after a series of unfair treaties. In 1817, the [[Church Missionary Society]] established [[CMS College Kottayam|CMS College]] as the first Western-style college in Kerala. It was welcomed by the [[Travancore]] government to provide administrators for the public bureaucracy.<ref name="cms">{{cite news|title=Setting standards of excellence: UGC recognition has added to CMS College's list of merits.|date=4 January 2005|url= http://www.hindu.com/edu/2005/01/04/stories/2005010400140400.htm |accessdate=5 April 2010|archive-date=15 March 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315182258/http://www.hindu.com/edu/2005/01/04/stories/2005010400140400.htm|url-status=dead |work=[[The Hindu]]}}</ref>

[[File:Gandhi at vaikom satyagraha-2.jpg|thumb|[[Mahatma Gandhi]] at [[Vaikom Satyagraha]]|upright|left]]
Kottayam has played its role in all the political agitations of modern times. The ‘Malayali Memorial ‘ agitation may be said to have had its origin in Kottayam. The Malayali Memorial sought to secure better representation for educated Travancoreans in the Travancore civil service against persons from outside. The Memorial, which was presented to the Maharaja Sri Moolam Thirunal (1891) was drafted at a public meeting held in the Kottayam Public Library. The event marked the beginning of the modern political movement in the State.<ref name="About Kottayam"/>

It was here that the famous Vaikom Satyagraha (1924–25), an epic struggle for eradication of untouchability, took place. Scheduled castes and other backward classes in Travancore were denied not only entry into temples, but also access to temple roads. Vaikom, the seat of a celebrated Siva Temple, was the venue of the symbolic satyagraha.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kottayam.nic.in/history/|title=Kottayam|date=3 April 2020|website=Government of Kerala|access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> Due to these protests, the Maharaja [[Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma]] issued the [[Temple Entry Proclamation]] in 1936.

===Contemporary period (1949 - Present)===
Kottayam became a revenue division of Travancore.<ref name="Kurien" /> A fifth division, [[Devikulam]], existed for a short period but was later added to Kottayam. At the time of the integration of the [[Travancore-Cochin|State of Travancore and Cochin]] in 1949, these revenue divisions were redesignated as districts and the Diwan Peshkars gave way to [[district collector]]s, with the Kottayam district established in July&nbsp;1949.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kottayam.nic.in/#|title = Kottayam District, Government of Kerala &#124; Kottayam, the Land of Letters &#124; India}}</ref>

== Geography ==

Kottayam has an average elevation of {{convert|3|m}} above sea level.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kottayam Travel Guide: Useful information to visit Kottayam. 8 Reviews |url=http://www.placesonline.com/asia/india/kerala/kottayam/introduction.asp}}</ref> It is situated in the [[Drainage basin|basin]] of the [[Meenachil River]] and in the basin of the [[Vembanad]] backwaters, which are formed from several streams in the [[Western Ghats]] of the [[Idukki district]]. The town is situated near the inland [[estuary]] of [[Meenachil River|Meenachil]] river where it empties into the [[Vembanad]] lake in [[Kumarakom]].

According to the division of places in Kerala based on altitudes, Kottayam is classified as a midland area. The general soil type is [[alluvium|alluvial]] soil. The vegetation is mainly tropical evergreen and moist deciduous.

===Climate===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Kottayam has a [[Tropical monsoon climate]] (Am).

The climate in this district is moderate and pleasant. Kottayam's proximity to the [[equator]] results in little seasonal temperature variation, with moderate to high levels of [[humidity]].
