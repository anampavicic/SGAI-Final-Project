==History==
[[File: Bhai Pratap. Cotton Khadi Movement.jpg|thumb|left|Bhai Pratap spinning cotton yarn]]
Soon after the [[Partition of India]], in 1947, a large group of [[Sindhi Hindus]] refugees from [[Sindh]] of Pakistan migrated to India. The maharaja of Kutch [[Vijayaraji]] donated {{convert|15000|acre|km2}} of land to Bhai Pratap, who founded the Sindhu Resettlement Corporation Ltd. (SRC) to rehabilitate [[Sindhi Hindus]] that migrated from [[Sindh]] in [[Pakistan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sindhology.org/sindhiyat.asp |title=Welcome to Indian Institute of Sindhology |access-date=2010-08-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107184623/http://www.sindhology.org/sindhiyat.asp |archive-date=2010-01-07 }}</ref>

The Sindhu Resettlement Corporation Ltd was formed with [[Jivatram Kripalani|Acharya Kriplani]] as chairman and [[Bhai Pratap Dialdas]] as managing director. The corporation's primary goal was to help displaced people find new dwellings by building a new township. The original plan was prepared by a team of planners headed by [[Otto Königsberger|Otto H. Königsberger]], director of the division of housing in the Government of India. Later, the plan was revised by Adams, Howard and Greeley Company in 1952. The foundation stone of the town was laid with the blessings of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in 1947. Hence, the town was named Gandhidham. To clean the desert where it was built, Pratap gave an incentive of 25 paise to kill [[Scorpion|scorpions]] and 50 paise to kill snakes.<ref name=src_web>
{{cite web|access-date=2007-09-28|archive-date=2009-12-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217014300/http://www.sindhu-src.org/aboutbhai.html|page=1|publisher=The Sindhu Resettlement Corporation, Gandhidham, India|quote=To clean the desert where it was built, Bhai Pratap gave an incentive of 25 paise to kill scorpions and 50 paise to kill snakes|title=Bhai Pratap|url=http://www.sindhu-src.org/aboutbhai.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> The original plan envisaged 400,000 as of the ultimate population of the town, expecting half of it to be reached in the mid-1970s. A revised plan envisaged three stages of town development with the mid-stage lasting longer with a population of around 150,000.

==Geography and climate==
Gandhidham is located at latitude 23.08° N longitude 70.13° E.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About Gandhidham, Gandhidham Information, Gandhidham Facts |url=https://www.gandhidhamonline.in/city-guide/about-gandhidham |access-date=2023-10-22 |website=www.gandhidhamonline.in}}</ref> The main city is constructed in accordance with the principles of
[[Vastu shastra|Vastu-Shastra]] (Hindu belief of construction), i.e., the main city has its face directed to the East.

Due to the very high [[potential evapotranspiration]], Gandhidham has a [[semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSh'') receiving around {{convert|385|mm|in|0|disp=or}} of rainfall per year.

Almost all rainfall occurs during the monsoon season from June to September — outside this period, Gandhidham averages just {{convert|15|mm|in|2|disp=or}} of rain in eight months. Gandhidham's amount of rainfall, although not especially low on paper, is amongst the most erratic anywhere in the world with a [[coefficient of variation]] of around sixty percent <ref>Van Etten, Eddie J.B.; ‘Inter-annual Rainfall Variability of Arid Australia: greater than elsewhere?’; ''[[Australian Geographer]]''; 40 (2009), pp. 109-120</ref> – among the few comparably variable climates in the world being the [[Line Islands]] of Kiribati, the [[Pilbara]] coast of Western Australia, the [[sertão]] of Northeastern Brazil, and the [[Cape Verde]] islands.<ref>Dewar, Robert E. and Wallis, James R; ‘Geographical patterning of interannual rainfall variability in the tropics and near tropics: An L-moments approach’; in ''[[Journal of Climate]]'', 12; pp. 3457-3466</ref>

During the "cool" season from October to March, temperatures range from very warm to hot during the afternoon and are cool to pleasant in the mornings. Whilst during the hot season, afternoon temperatures become sweltering and extremely unpleasant, especially when, with the approach of the monsoon, humidity increases.

==Governance==
The city is represented by a [[Gandhidham (Vidhan Sabha constituency)|constituency]] in the [[Gujarat Legislative Assembly]]. It forms part of the [[Kachchh (Lok Sabha constituency)|Kachchh Lok Sabha constituency]].

==2001 Earthquake Calamity==
[[File:Lilashah statue at Gandhidham Kutch Gujarat.jpg|thumb|Lilashah statue at Gandhidham]]
The [[2001 Gujarat earthquake|Gujarat earthquake of 2001]] majorly affected the city of Gandhidham along with many nearby towns like Bhuj, Anjar, Bhachau and more. The shock, which measured 7.7 on the moment [[Seismic magnitude scales|magnitude scale]] and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of XI (''Extreme''), killed 13,805–20,023, left roughly 166,800 injured, and many were left homeless including Gandhidham. The death toll in the Kutch region was 12,300. Bhuj, which was situated only 50&nbsp; km away from the Gandhidham, was devastated. Considerable damage also occurred in City Gandhidham and Bhachau and Anjar with hundreds of villages flattened in Taluka of Anjar, Bhuj and [[Bhachau]].

==Land of Adipur and Gandhidham==
Gandhidham was the dream of Pratap Dialdas. He requested great Leaders of India for the procurement of land in the Kachchh region. They requested [[Vijayarajaji|Maharao Vijayraj]] Ji of Kachchh for granting of land for re-settlement of Sindhi community people migrated from Sindh. Maharao, without any delay, granted 15000 acres of land for the purpose. Bhai Pratap said this is too big land and cannot be developed by SRC Ltd, therefore, he desired to keep with him only 2,600 acres, and the rest of the land was given to KPT and GDA for management. Today Adipur and Gandhidham townships are the townships of pride in the District of Kachchh only with the grace of Rajput Kshatriya ancestors – Provided by Ram Amarnani.

Distance between twin-townships of Adipur & Gandhidham is 5 km developed fully . The airport road dividing wards 5 & 7 divides this city, whereas Municipality is one, known as Gandhidham Municipal Corporation (from 2023). These towns are divided in two parts wherein land is recognized as Wards & Sectors. They have six wards each 1 to 6 in Adipur and 7 to 12 in Gandhidham. These wards consist of commercial, industrial and residential plots of land. The land which is owned and managed by SRC (The Sindhu Resettlement Corporation Ltd) is known as 'Wards' and The land which is owned and managed by KPT (Kandla Port Trust) is known as 'Sectors'. There are 13 such sectors in Gandhidham. Apart from this, there is vast land managed by GDA (Gandhidham Development Authority) which is known as "NU". For the construction of any permanent structure in these townships, the permission of GDA is a must.

The Authority was constituted by the [[Government of Gujarat|State Government]] under their Resolution No. TPS-3858(a) dated 08.08.1958 published in the Bombay Government Gazette part IVB, Extraordinary issue dated 11.08.1958. The GDA was created on 08.08.1958.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Approval For City |first=State Cabinet Accepted |date=29 June 2023 |title=About the conversation of the town into the city. |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/state-cabinet-gives-approval-for-five-new-municipal-corporations/articleshow/101353416.cms |archive-url= |website=Times of India}}</ref>
