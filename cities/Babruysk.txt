'''Babruysk'''  or '''Bobruysk''' ({{langx|be|Бабруйск|Babrujsk}}, {{IPA-be|bäˈbruɪ̯s̪k|IPA}}; {{langx|ru|Бобруйск}}, {{IPA|ru|bɐˈbruɪ̯s̪k|IPA}}; {{langx|yi|באָברויסק|Bobroysk}}) is a city in [[Mogilev Region]], [[Belarus]]. It serves as the administrative center of [[Babruysk District]], though it is administratively separated from the district.<ref name="pop"/> It is situated on the [[Berezina|Berezina River]]. Babruysk occupies an area of {{convert|66|km2|0|abbr=out}}, and comprises over 450 streets whose combined length stretches for over {{convert|430|km|0|abbr=on}}. {{As of|2024}}, it has a population of 207,351.<ref name="pop"/>{{historical populations|1897|34336|1923|33015|1926|39280|1939|84078|1959|97530|1970|137536|1979|192207|1989|221166|1999|220700|2009|215092|2019|212283|align=right|cols=1|source=pop-stat.mashke.org<ref>{{cite web|title=Cities & Towns of Belarus|url=http://pop-stat.mashke.org/belarus-cities.htm|date=2024-04-15}}</ref>}}Babruysk is located at the intersection of railroads to [[Asipovichy]], [[Zhlobin]], [[Aktsyabrski]] and roads to [[Minsk]], [[Gomel]], [[Mogilev]], [[Kalinkavichy]], [[Slutsk]], and [[Rahachow]]. It has the biggest timber mill in Belarus, and is also known for its chemical, machine building and metal-working industries.

In 2021, there were 38 public schools in Babruysk, with over 24,000 students. There are three schools specializing in music, dance and [[visual arts]]. Additionally, there is a medical school and numerous professional technical schools.

==Etymology==
The name ''Babruysk'' (as well as that of the [[Babruyka|Babruyka River]]) probably originates from the Belarusian word {{Transliteration|be|babyor}} ({{Lang|be|бабёр}}, {{lit|[[European Beaver|beaver]]}}), many of which used to inhabit the Berezina. However, beavers in the area had been almost eliminated by the end of the 19th century due to hunting and pollution.

==History==
Babruysk is one of the oldest cities in [[Belarus]]. It was first mentioned in writing in the middle of the 14th century. Investigations by [[archaeologists]] revealed that in the 5th and 6th centuries there existed [[Slavs|Slavic]] settlements up the river Biarezina from where Babruysk is currently located; findings of stone tools and weapons suggest that people have lived in the area since the [[Stone Age]].

During the reign of [[Vladimir I, Prince of Kiev]], in place of modern-day Babruysk there was a village whose inhabitants were occupied with fishing and beaver [[Trapping (Animal)|trapping]]. This is where the name Babruysk originated. For many centuries Babruysk was part of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and was an important militarily fortified border post. In the 14th century a [[castle]] was built on one of the hills near the Berezina River.

Babruysk was not only a major military base, but also a prominent trade center. There is evidence of a market containing nearly one hundred stalls, which implies significant financial activity. In the first half of the 17th century Babruysk became a big trade outpost thanks to its strategic position at the intersection of major trade routes and the Berezina river. There was a flowering of skilled tradesmen, including [[carpenter]]s, [[blacksmith]]s, [[goldsmith]]s, and bakers. The population in the first half of the 17th century was between 2,000 and 5,000 people.

[[File:Babruysk fortress 1811.jpg|left|thumb|[[Babruysk fortress]] in 1811]]

The town was surrounded by fortifications made from wood and earth, whose length stretched for over {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}}. These included a protective earth barrier, wooden walls, and almost a dozen two-story watchtowers. In the walls there were openings designed for the placement of firearms. After the [[Partitions of Poland|Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793 it came into the hands of [[Imperial Russia]]. In 1810, the construction of a [[fortress]] began to mark the border between Russia and [[Austria]] and [[Prussia]]; in 1812 it was almost completed and was successful in repelling [[Napoleon]]'s attack for four months. After the war the building was renewed on a large scale, and it was completed in 1820. That was one of the [[western Russian fortresses]]. The [[Babruysk fortress]] has served its purpose for many decades and today it is a major [[tourist attraction]].

The 1861 census showed a population of 15,766. The ethnic groups living in Babruysk included [[Belarusians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Polish people|Poles]], and [[Jews]]. As in other cities of Belarus, most of the buildings were constructed from wood. In 1866 there were 1498 houses, only 29 of which were made from brick.

There was a steady increase in the [[Jewish]] population of Babruysk following the [[Napoleonic wars]]. By 1897, in the population of 34,336 citizens, 60%, or 20,760 were Jews.<ref>Joshua D. Zimmerman, ''Poles, Jews, and the politics of nationality'', Univ of Wisconsin Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-299-19464-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6sbr9cZyw_4C&dq=population+Brest+Poles+Jews&pg=PA16 Google Print, p.16]</ref> Most of them were employed in crafts, industry, and trade.

During the 1890s, the citizens of Babruysk witnessed [[pogroms]] after the assassination of the Russian emperor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. Many of the attacks were repelled by armed Jewish self-defense.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

In 1902, the [[Great Fire of Babruysk]] left 2,500 families homeless and destroyed over 250 business, 15 schools and the market. There were more than 7 million rubles in property damage, however the city was quickly rebuilt, this time with brick and stone.

In 1904 the [[40th Infantry Division (Russian Empire)|40th Infantry Division]] of the [[Imperial Russian Army]] had its headquarters here.<ref name="Regiment 40 ID">{{cite web |last1=Romanov |first1=K.S. |title=40th Infantry Division |url=http://www.regiment.ru/upr/B/2/pd/40.htm |website=Regiment ru |publisher=Romanov K S |access-date=6 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160907005034/http://www.regiment.ru/upr/B/2/pd/40.htm |archive-date=7 September 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Between February 2 and March 11, 1918, was a [[Battle of Bobruysk (1918)|Battle of Bobrujsk]], between units of the [[Polish I Corps in Russia]], commanded by General [[Jozef Dowbor-Musnicki]], fought with the [[Red Army]] over the control of the city and region of Babruysk. 
In 1918–1920, town was captured by Polish forces.

===World War II===
On 28 June 1941, troops of the [[Wehrmacht|German]] [[Army Group Centre]] captured Babruysk. General [[Gotthard Heinrici]] considered the largely-evacuated city "a dump consisting mainly of wooden houses" and was appalled by the "extremely primitive" surrounding area.<ref>A German general on the Eastern Front: the letters and diaries of Gotthard Heinrici, 1941-1942, p.74.</ref> 
[[Dulag 131]], one of the largest camps for [[Soviet prisoners of war]], was located in the "citadel". An estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Red Army soldiers died there.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pohl |first1=Dieter |author1-link=Dieter Pohl |title=Die Herrschaft der Wehrmacht: Deutsche Militärbesatzung und einheimische Bevölkerung in der Sowjetunion 1941-1944 |date=2012 |publisher=Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag |doi=<!-- 10.1524/9783486707397 --> |isbn=978-3-486-70739-7 |url=https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1524/9783486707397/html |language=de|page=224}}</ref>

Believing that German troops would not target civilians, many Jews stayed behind. Consequently, 20,000 Babruysk Jews were shot and buried in mass graves. [[Ghetto]] and labor camps were established in the southwest part of town. The conditions inside the camps were horrible and involved lack of food, lack of sanitation and perpetual abuse by the [[Nazism|Nazi]] guards. Soon the Nazis began executing the Jews in the ghetto in groups of about 30. By 1943 all labor camps had been liquidated and the remaining Jews killed. The few Jews who escaped joined partisan forces in the surrounding forest and went about attacking enemy railroad lines. There is a small memorial dedicated to the memory of Babruysk Jews killed in the [[Holocaust]], located in the [[Nahalat Yitzhak]] cemetery, [[Giv'atayim]], [[Israel]], as part of the [[Babi Yar]] memorial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jhrgbelarus.org/Heritage_Holocaust.php?pid=&lang=en&city_id=3&type=3|title=Jewish Heritage Research Group in Belarus|work=jhrgbelarus.org|access-date=May 27, 2011|archive-date=July 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723002307/http://jhrgbelarus.org/Heritage_Holocaust.php?pid=&lang=en&city_id=3&type=3|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On June 29, 1944, the [[Red Army]] liberated Babruysk. The city lay in ruins; while the population had been 84,107 in 1939, it was down to 28,352 following the war. The difficult process of rebuilding was conducted by thousands of workers and war prisoners who labored to clear factories and streets of rubble and filled in craters made by the bombardment. The machine building plant had been almost completely destroyed, but was restored to working order by the end of 1944. Many other factories and facilities were also rebuilt.
===Postwar era===
Between 1944 and 1954, Babruysk served as an administrative center of [[Babruysk Voblast]].

The population recovered swiftly as well. In 1959 it was 96,000, in 1965 – 116,000, in 1968 – 122,500, in 1970 – 136,000 and by 1989, 232,000 people were living in Babruysk. This was mostly due to urbanization, where people moved into the city from the surrounding rural areas.
