==History==
{{See also|Bencoolen Presidency}}
The British East India Company founded Bengkulu (named [[British Bencoolen|Bencoolen]] by the British), in 1685, as their new commercial centre for the region.  In the 17th century, the British [[East India Company]] controlled the [[spice trade]] in the Lampung region of southern Sumatra from a port in [[Banten]], in the northwest of the neighbouring island of [[Java]]. In 1682, a troop of the [[Dutch East India Company]] attacked Banten. The local crown prince submitted to the [[Dutch people|Dutch]], who then recognised him as Sultan. The Dutch expelled all other Europeans present in Banten, leading the [[British people|British]] to establish Bengkulu.  In 1714, the British built [[Fort Marlborough]] at Bengkulu.

The trading centre was never financially viable, because of its remoteness and the difficulty in procuring [[black pepper|pepper]]. Despite these difficulties, the British persisted, maintaining a presence there for over a century, ceding it to the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch]] as part of the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] to focus their attention on [[Malacca]]. [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|Edmund Roberts]], the first [[United States of America|U.S.]] envoy to the Far East, visited Bengkulu in 1832.<ref name=Roberts1>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Edmund|title=Embassy to the Eastern Courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat|year=1837|publisher=Harper & Brothers|location=New York|page=34|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/34/|access-date=14 October 2013|archive-date=17 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170717171803/https://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/34/|url-status=live}}</ref> Like the rest of present-day Indonesia, Bengkulu remained a Dutch colony until [[World War II]].

[[Sukarno]] (later the first president of [[Indonesia]]) was imprisoned by the Dutch in the 1930s, including a brief period in Bengkulu. Sukarno met his future wife, [[Fatmawati]], during his time in Bengkulu.

==Geography==
The region is at low elevation and can have [[swamp]]s. In the mid-19th century, [[malaria]] and related diseases were common.<ref name=Roberts2/> Bengkulu lies near the Sunda Fault and is prone to earthquakes and tsunamis. The June [[2000 Enggano earthquake]] killed at least 100 people. A recent report predicts that Bengkulu is "at risk of inundation over the next few decades from undersea earthquakes predicted along the coast of Sumatra"<ref>{{cite news|title=Indonesian Cities Lie in Shadow of Cyclical Tsunami|author=Andrew C. Revkin|work=[[The New York Times]] (Late Edition (East Coast)) p. A.5|date=5 December 2006}}</ref> [[2007 Bengkulu earthquakes|A series of earthquakes]] struck Bengkulu in September 2007, killing 13 people.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Gelling|first=Peter|date=15 September 2007|title=With Every Rumble, Indonesians Fear Additional Ruin|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/15/world/asia/15quake.html|access-date=25 December 2021|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=19 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219173554/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/15/world/asia/15quake.html|url-status=live}}</ref>
Bengkulu City has an area of 151.70&nbsp;km ² and is located on the west coast of Sumatra island, with the province having a coastline of about 525&nbsp;km in length. The area of this city lies parallel to the mountains of [[Barisan Mountains|Bukit Barisan]] and face to face with the [[Indian Ocean]].

==Administrative districts==
The City of Bengkulu comprised eight administrative [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan'') at the time of the 2010 Census, but subsequently, a ninth district (Singaran Pati) was formed out of the northwest half of the existing Gading Cempaka District. The districts are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and the 2020 Census,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> together with the official estimates as of mid-2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Bengkulu Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.1771)</ref> The table also includes the numbers of [[administrative village]]s (all classed as urban ''kelurahan'') in each district and its postcodes.

==Governance==
Based on Emergency Law Number 6 Year 1956, Bengkulu was one of the Small Town with an area of 17.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in South Sumatera province. The mention of this Small Town then changed to Kotamadya based on Law No. 1 of 1957 on the subject of local government. After the issuance of Law Number 9 Year 1967 regarding the establishment of Bengkulu Province, Bengkulu Municipality as well as being the capital of the province. However, the law only came into force on 1 June 1968 after the issuance of Government Regulation No. 20/1968.

Based on the Decree of the Provincial Governor of Bengkulu No. 821.27-039 dated 22 January 1981, the Municipality of Bengkulu was subsequently divided into two districts namely Teluk Segara District and Gading Cempaka District. With the enactment of the Decree of the Mayor of Bengkulu Region No. 440 and 444 of 1981 and reinforced by the Decree of the Governor of Bengkulu No. 141 of 1982 on 1 October 1982, the mention of the territory of Kedatukan was erased and Pemangkuan became ''kelurahan''. Furthermore, based on Government Regulation No. 41 of 1982, Bengkulu Region Second Level Region consists of 2 Definitive Districts with Teluk Segara District overseeing 17 villages and Gading Cempaka District overseeing 21 urban villages. Then based on Government Regulation No. 46 of 1986, the area of Bengkulu Municipality was increased to 151.7&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and consisted of four districts, comprising 38 urban villages (''kelurahan'') and 17 rural villages (''desa''). Another five districts were later added by splitting these four.

Historically, there was a [[court]] where all legal investigations passed through. Criminals who were [[death sentence|sentenced to death]] had copies of their trials sent to [[Java]] for review.<ref name=Roberts2/>

== Transportation ==
Bengkulu is connected by road, air and sea. There are several public transportation modes in Bengkulu such as taxis, angkot (mini-van), ''ojek'' (motorcycle taxi).

=== Airport ===
The city is served by the newly renovated [[Fatmawati Soekarno Airport]]. There is one terminal building for both international and domestic flights.

=== Harbour ===
Bengkulu's harbour, known locally as Pulau Bai, serves inter-island as well as International routes. The ferry terminal is the access point to [[Enggano Island]].

== Media ==
The oldest newspaper in the Bengkulu region is ''Rakyat Bengkulu'', part of the Jawa Pos Group. Several other newspapers such as ''Bengkulu Ekspress'' and ''Radar Bengkulu'' are also available.

The privately owned RBTV and BETV are the local TV stations based in Bengkulu. The public [[TVRI]] Lampung has also covered the city.

==Demographics==
As of 1832, the population of Bengkulu, and its surrounding area, was estimated at 18,000 people. During that time, the region had a varied population: [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Indian people|Indians]], and more. [[Chinatown]] was located in the centre of the city.<ref name=Roberts2/>

==Economy==
When under Dutch rule, Bengkulu had [[plantation]]s. [[Parsi]] people harvested and processed [[nutmeg]] and [[mace (spice)|mace]]. The nutmeg would be processed into [[confectionery]] products. [[Piper (genus)|Pepper]] was a large export, too. The area also produced smaller amounts of [[coffee]] and rice, however, both were primarily imported from [[Padang]]. Fruit and animal production was also significant.<ref name=Roberts2>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Edmund|title=Embassy to the Eastern Courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat|year=1837|publisher=Harper & Brothers|location=New York|pages=38–40|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/38/|access-date=15 October 2013|archive-date=15 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015113145/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/38/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Tourism==
[[File:Bengkulu city square.jpg|thumb|right|A square in Bengkulu City.]]
In this city, there are several British heritage buildings and fortresses, including [[Fort Marlborough]], founded in 1713 on Long Beach, Hamilton Monument and [[Thomas Parr Monument]] in the downtown area, [[Sukarno]]'s exile house on Soekarno-Hatta Street, and Jamik Mosque designed by Ir. Sukarno.
Bengkulu City also has several other mainstay attractions, such as Chinatown, Tapak Paderi Beach, Jakat Beach, Dendam Tak Sudah Lake, and Pulau Baai Harbor. This area has been set by the local government into a typical souvenir center.

In this outlet, travelers can enjoy processed Durian ranging from durian ice cream and a variety of variants, durian toast, pancake durian, durian pancakes, and so forth.

==Culture==
Each year, in the Muslim month of [[Muharram]], Bengkulu hosts the ceremony ''Tabot''. The two centuries-old ritual was made by artisans from [[Madras]] in India for the construction of Fort Marlborough. It celebrates the martyrdom of Imam Shiite Hussein's death at the [[Battle of Karbala]]. The Tabot is an opportunity for a grand procession, accompanied by songs and dances performed by young girls.

==Education==
As of 1832, the city had two [[Lancasterian method]] Dutch schools. At one school, students were taught [[math]], [[religion]], and the [[Malay language]]. The students frequently used a Malay version of ''[[The New Testament]]'' to learn Malayan, which was created by [[Robert Boyle]] when the British occupied Bengkulu. The other school was at an [[orphanage]].<ref name=Roberts2/>

In this town lies the only state university in the province of Bengkulu, the [[Universitas Bengkulu]] (UNIB).
