[[File:Brick Minaret KhorramAbad .jpg|alt=|left|thumb|303x303px|[[Brick Minaret]] of Khorramabad]]

=== Brick minaret ===
[[Brick Minaret]] is a cylindrical brick tower from [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] and [[Buyid dynasty|Buyid]] dynasties located inside the ancient city of Shapur khast, south of Khorramabad.

This Iranian minaret is a combination of the Indian [[Stupa]], commemorative columns, and the [[central Asia]] tradition of tower building for defensive and [[communication]] purposes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The development of the Minaret in Iran under the Saljügs. A thesis presented for the degree of M. Phil. at London University.|last=Hutt, Anthony Max.|date=1974|oclc=46455166}}</ref> 

=== [[Shapuri Bridge|Sahpuri Bridge]] ===

Shapoori Bridge dates back to the [[Sassanid era]] and is registered on the list of National Monuments.

==Attractions==
Although not a major tourist destination, it is quite scenic and possesses several attractions, such as five [[Paleolithic]] cave-dwelling sites.<ref>Baumler, Mark F. and Speth, John D.
