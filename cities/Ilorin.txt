[[File:Plan of Ilorin.jpg|left|thumb|160x160px|An 1897 plan of Ilorin city]]
Ilorin, city, [[Emirate|traditional emirate]], and capital of Kwara state, western [[Nigeria]]. It is located on the Awun River, a minor tributary of the Niger. Founded in the late 18th century by Yoruba people, it became the capital of a kingdom that was a vassal state of the [[Oyo Empire|Oyo empire.]] Oyo’s commander at Ilorin, [https://www.thehistoryville.com/aare-ona-kakanfo-afonja-oyo-empire/ Kakanfo] (Field Marshal) [[Afonja]], led a rebellion in 1817 that destroyed the unity of the empire. He was aided by Mallam Alimi (a Fulani from Sokoto), and by Hausa slaves. Afonja was double-crossed by the Fulani, and, upon his assassination, Alimi’s son, Abd al-Salam (Abdul Salami), became emir of Ilorin and pledged allegiance (''c.'' 1829) to the Sokoto caliphate. As a Muslim emirate, Ilorin attacked several towns in Northern Yorubaland and destroyed the Oyo capital, Oyo Ile (Old Oyo, or Katunga), 40 miles (64&nbsp;km) northwest, in 1837. Abd al-Salam conducted a jihad toward the sea but was ultimately stopped by the [[Ibadan]] victory over his cavalrymen at [[Osogbo|Oshogbo]] in 1840.

Throughout the 19th century, Ilorin served as a major trade centre between the Hausa of the north and the Yoruba of the south.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ilorin {{!}} Nigeria, Map, Facts, & Population {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Ilorin |access-date=2024-02-11 |website=britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> It strongly resisted British rule, and not until 1897, when the army of the Royal Niger Company arrived after conquering Bida (106 miles east-northeast), did Ilorin recognize British supremacy. In 1900, Ilorin emirate was the only part of Yorubaland to be included in the [[Northern Nigeria]] Protectorate, which, later in the colonial period, developed into the Northern Province and then the Northern Region. With the subdivision of the country’s administrative regions in 1967, Ilorin became part of West Central (later Kwara) state.

== Demographics ==
[[File:Ilorin 1929.png|thumb|Aerial view of Ilorin in 1929]]
Modern Ilorin is mainly inhabited by the Yoruba people, although its traditional ruler has a Fulani heritage.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Voice |first=Muslim |date=2022-09-15 |title=Khalifa Sanusi II visits Emir of Ilorin {{!}} The Muslim Voice, Nigeria |url=https://muslimvoice.com.ng/2022/09/15/khalifa-sanusi-ii-visits-emir-of-ilorin/ |access-date=2023-08-28 |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Sports ==
Ilorin has an 18,000-capacity stadium and two professional [[football team]]s; [[Kwara United F.C.]] playing in the top-tier league of [[Nigeria Professional Football League]] (N.P.F.L) which is run by the League Management Company; and [[ABS FC]] in the second division which is [[Bet9ja]] [https://nnl.com.ng/ Nigeria National league].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nigeria - Kwara United F.C, NPFL Club Kwara United|url=https://npfl.ng/team/kwara-united/|access-date=2021-05-29|website=Nigeria Professional Football League|language=en-US}}</ref>

The city has the only standard [[baseball field]] in [[West Africa]]. It has also hosted several national [[handball]] competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ilorin.info/fullnews.php?id=26280|title=Handball: Kwara To Host Nat'l U-18, U-21 Championships|date=17 January 2020}}</ref>

==Commerce==
[[File:Shoprite, Ilorin.JPG|thumb|ShopRite Ilorin]]
The [[political economy]] of [[Kwara State]] can be traced to 1967 when it was created.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kwara {{!}} state, Nigeria {{!}} Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kwara|access-date=2022-02-16|website=www.britannica.com|language=en}}</ref> Since then the state has undergone various developmental efforts, mostly initiated by the [[Federal government of Nigeria|federal government]] given the nature of the Nigerian state, a centralized federal system where development policies and programmes originate from the centre.<ref name=BPI />

The state has a large area of rich [[agricultural land]]. The [[limestone]] and [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] of Oreke, [[Kaolinite|kaolin]] and [[clay]] at Idofian near Ilorin and other parts of the state, pure gold in [[Kaiama]] and the [[Pategi|Patigi]] area, and the highly exportable rich [[tantalite]] deposit of Iporin make Kwara State rich in [[Natural resource|primary resources]].

Initially, Kwara State had only a few major industrial companies, Global Soap (not more in operation), Detergent Industries Nigeria Limited and the International Tobacco Company. Successive administrations have attempted to attract industrialists to the state.<ref>{{Cite web|title=DOYIN GROUP OF COMPANIES OUR COMPANY|url=http://www.doyingroup.com/ourcompanies.htm|access-date=2021-05-29|website=doyingroup.com}}</ref>

With such efforts, Ilorin has become the hub for [[cashew]] processing in Nigeria and [[Olam International]] has set up Africa's biggest cashew processing plant. The plant processes 100 [[tonne|MT]] of cashews every day and provides employment to over 2000 workers.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2013-07-31|title=TechnoServe, Olam train 6,000 cashew farmers|url=https://archive.businessday.ng/agriculture/article/technoserve-olam-train-6000-cashew-farmers/|access-date=2021-05-29|website=BusinessDay NG, TV, and Podcast|language=en-US}}</ref>

Ilorin operates a relatively well-developed intra-city [[public transport]] system, and the major roads within the metropolis are well constructed.

There are three different modes of available transit from one place to another in the city – the most popular being the conventional taxis. [[Car rental|Car-hire]] services are also available in major hotels. Furthermore, there are commercial motorbikes, commonly called "[[Okada (motorcycle taxi)|Okada]]". A more recent arrival on Ilorin's roads are commercial tricycles, popularly called "Keke NAPEP" or "Keke" or "Keke Maruwa", some of which are given on loan to beneficiaries of the [[National Poverty Eradication Programme]]. Ilorin taxis are painted yellow and green.

Ilorin's central location makes it easily accessible to all parts of the country by [[Aviation|air]], [[road]] and [[Rail transport|rail]]. The state has a good network of roads, rail and air transportation facilities linking it with Nigeria's other industrial and commercial centres. Transportation is quite affordable in Ilorin for movement from one place to another for as low as one hundred [[Nigerian naira|naira]].

There are scheduled daily commercial flights to and from [[Ilorin International Airport]] by [[Arik Air]] and [[Overland Airways]]. The now defunct [[Capital Airlines (Nigeria)|Capital Airlines]] also operated from Ilorin. Current destinations include all of the major cities in Nigeria. The airport has also been re-designed and equipped as an international cargo airport.

Ilorin offers reliable road transport services to [[Lagos State|Lagos]], [[Ogun State|Ogun]], [[Osun State|Osun]], [[Ondo State|Ondo]], [[Oyo State|Oyo]], [[Ekiti State|Ekiti]], [[Kogi State|Kogi]], [[Niger State|Niger]], [[Kaduna State|Kaduna]] and [[Plateau State]]s. Similar services are available to and from [[Onitsha]], [[Port Harcourt]], [[Abuja]], [[Aba, Abia|Aba]] and others.

A major [[Controlled-access highway|expressway]] to [[Ibadan]], numbered E1, is currently under construction by P.W. International. Ilorin is served by the railway and highway from Lagos (160 miles south-southwest), via Ibadan, which intersect in the city, and it has an international airport.

The city is a confluence of cultures, populated by the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], [[Fula people|Fulani]], [[Nupe people|Nupe]], [[Bariba people|Bariba]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]] and [[Hausa people|Hausa]] ethnicities across Nigeria, as well as foreign and nationals. There are large Christian and Islamic populations, and many ceremonial activities, mostly with religious aspects, take place in the city throughout the year.

Notable Pentecostal churches include [[Redeemed Christian Church of God]], [[The Gospel Faith Mission International]] (Gofamint), [[Deeper Life Church]], and [[Living Faith Church]]. [[Seventh-day Adventist]]s are also represented. Most Christian churches in the state started schools and introduced innovative ideas that were readily adopted by the Muslim schools.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cjmm/2004/00000024/00000001/art00014 |title=ingentaconnect Christian churches in Ilorin, Nigeria: a brief historical survey |journal=Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs |publisher=Ingentaconnect.com |date=2004-04-01 |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=175–180 |doi=10.1080/1360200042000212214 |access-date=2013-12-17|last1=Yahaya |first1=Eliasu |s2cid=144740520 }}</ref>

There has been a [[Latter-day Saint]] congregation in Ilorin since 1992. In that year an LDS mission was organized in the city that year, but shortly later merged with the one in [[Enugu]]. Starting in 2016 additional LDS congregations were organized in Ilorin, which in 2018 was transferred to the new Nigerian Ibadan Mission, and had a district organized.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DeToVIncRUgvAaBie-Mt_x5mGi60uawO/view?usp=embed_facebook|title=Cumorah Newsletter - July 2018.pdf|website=Google Docs|accessdate=6 December 2022}}</ref>

===Ilorin Central Mosque===
===History===
The first Ilorin central mosque was founded in 1820 in the Agbarere Area, popularly known as "Ile-Elewa", under the leadership of Sheik Imam Muhammad Munab'bau. This was followed in 1835 when another central mosque was built at Idi-Ape during the reign of the first Emir of Ilorin, Abdus-salam. However, more than a century later, this central mosque could no longer cope with the growth in the Muslim population of the city. For this reason, in 1974, the ninth Emir of Ilorin, Alhaji Zulkarnaini Gambari, invited Grand Mufti Alhaji Mohammed Kamal-u-deen and the then present Wazirin Ngeri of Ilorin, Abubakar Sola Saraki, to co-ordinate the fundraising and construction of a new central mosque.

===The present Ilorin Central Mosque===
[[File:Central Mosque Ilorin19.jpg|thumb|Central Mosque Ilorin]]
On 30 April 1977, the foundation was laid for the new mosque by the Emir of [[Gwandu]] on behalf of the Sarki Musulmi, Sultan Abubakar III. The new Ilorin Central Mosque was completed and officially opened in 1981 by the former president Alhaji [[Shehu Shagari]]. The Mosque was renovated, rehabilitated and expanded in 2012 with a majestic view. The newly redecorated mosque was recommissioned on 14 December 2012.

===The "New" Ilorin Central Mosque===
Planning for the rehabilitation, refurbishment and redecoration of the Central Mosque started in 2007 when Alhaji Ibrahim Zulu Gambari, CFR, the eleventh Emir of Ilorin, with assistance from Abubakar Bukola Saraki, the Turaki of Ilorin, and the former Governor of [[Kwara State]], set up a technical committee headed by Alhaji Shehu Abdul-gafar on the rehabilitation and enhancement of the central mosque. The committee has invited expertise from specialists in mosque construction from around the world, especially from [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], and [[Nigeria]].

In addition to the general restoration and enhancement of the mosque, it now has a total of 99 domes of different diameters, 75 feet above the floor. The large dome is made of gold finish while the four big domes around are coated in green with reflective illumination. The mosque form is enveloped within a pyramid shape with a square base and 45 inclinations for the faces. It has four accessible minarets, each standing at a height of 150 feet. Moreover, all the dilapidated domes and minarets with mosaic finishing were restored and finished with cut-to-size marble. The exterior and interior are covered by special marble while the expanded courtyard was constructed with heat-absorbing granite (marble) finish. The doors and windows were replaced with specially designed ones befitting the new mosque concept.

Additionally, it was learned that many residents of the impacted buildings along Obbo and Unity roads in Ilorin remained inside until 19 September 2019 afternoon because they were unable to leave the water that had engulfed their structures.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wande |first=S.-Davies |date=2019-09-19 |title=Flood destroys valuables in Ilorin |url=https://tribuneonlineng.com/flood-destroys-valuables-in-ilorin/ |access-date=2023-08-28 |website=Tribune Online |language=en-GB}}</ref>

== Pollution ==
Ilorin, a capital city in Kwara State is taken over by heaps of refuse in major streets. This is as a result of Kwara State Waste Management inability to evacuate garbage bins. The bins, stationed at designated points across the city, were full to the brim, thereby forcing residents to dump refuse by the roadside and walkways. The health implication as failure to evacuate the refuse could provoke an outbreak of diseases as a result of abandoned refuse containers by the roadside until they emitted stinking odour into the atmosphere, causing serious discomfort to the residents.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/north-central/254949-ilorin-residents-lament-refuse-situation-water-scarcity.html?tztc=1 |access-date=2023-09-30 |website=www.premiumtimesng.com}}</ref>
