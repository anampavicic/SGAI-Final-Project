'''Pasay''', officially the '''City of Pasay''' ({{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Pasay}}; {{IPA|tl|ˈpaː.saɪ̯|IPA}}), is a [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] in the [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]] of the [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 440,656 people.{{PH census|current}}

Due to its location just south of [[Manila]], Pasay quickly became an urban town during the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American colonial period]]. It is now best known for being the site of most of [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] and of complexes such as [[Newport City, Metro Manila|Newport City]] and the [[SM Mall of Asia|SM Central Business Park]].

==Etymology==
There are possible explanations on the origins of the city's name:
*A legend suggested that it may have been named after Dayang-dayang Pasay, a princess of the Kingdom of [[Namayan]] and daughter of [[Maynila (historical polity)|Kingdom of Maynila]] ruler [[Rajah Sulayman]]. She inherited half of her father's lands, which encompasses the present-day city, and founded the present-day city.<ref name="esq" /><ref name="aimhigh2008">{{cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2008/12/02/420086/aim-high-pasay|title=Aim High Pasay|first=Alejandro|last=Roces|date=December 2, 2008|accessdate=April 9, 2024|publisher=The Philippine Star}}</ref><ref name="RizalProvinceDirectory1934" />
*Another legend suggested that it was named after Pasay, one of the sons of a ruler of Namayan who inherited his territories that also includes the present-day city.<ref name="Dery2001"/>
*There's also a romantic legend where a man named Jose loudly cried out "Paz-ay!" at the grave of his wealthy love interest, Paz, symbolizing their forbidden love and Paz's eventual death due to loneliness. In tribute, Paz's parents named their hacienda ''Paz-ay'' or ''Pasay''.<ref name="esq">{{cite web|url=https://www.esquiremag.ph/long-reads/features/story-names-cities-of-manila-a00304-20191021-lfrm|title=A Short History Behind the Name of Every Metro Manila City|date=October 21, 2019|accessdate=April 9, 2019|website=Esquire Magazine}}</ref><ref name="travelcity" />
*Some historians believe that the city is named after the medicinal plant named ''pasaw'' ([[Pseuderanthemum reticulatum]]) that once grew abundantly there.<ref name="travelcity">{{cite book|url=https://www.pasay.gov.ph/Resources/FINAL%20PASAY%20FULL%20BOOK_small.pdf|title=Pasay: Rise of the Travel City|publisher=Media Touchstone Ventures, Inc.|last=Velasco|first=Melandrew|date=June 2019|accessdate=April 12, 2024|isbn=978-621-8047-16-7}}</ref>
*According to American historian [[Austin Craig]], Pasay was known as ''Javan Pasar'', a corruption of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''bazar'' as the town was a marketplace.<ref name="RizalProvinceDirectory1934">{{Cite book |last=Salonga |first=Isayas |url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/philamer/aar6353.0001.001 |title=Rizal Province directory |publisher=[[University of Michigan]] Digital Collections |year=1934 |volume=1 |location=[[Manila]]|accessdate=April 20, 2024}}</ref>{{rp|page=[https://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/philamer/aar6353.0001.001/117?rgn=full+text&view=image 117]}}

==History==
=== Early history ===
{{See also|Namayan|Rajahnate of Maynila}}

[[File:Map of the Kingdom of Namayan.jpg|left|thumb|120px|The map of territory once said to be under the rule of [[Namayan]], which includes Pasay, in modern [[Metro Manila]]]]

In local folk history about the period before the arrival of Spanish colonizers, Pasay is said to have been part of [[Namayan]] (sometimes also called Sapa), a [[confederation]] of [[Barangay state|barangay]]s which supposedly controlled territory stretching from [[Manila Bay]] to [[Laguna de Bay]], and which, upon the arrival of the Spanish, eventually became known as Santa Ana de Sapa (modern day [[Santa Ana, Manila]]).<ref name="Dery2001">{{cite book  | last = Dery  | first = Luis Camara  | title = A History of the Inarticulate  | publisher = New Day Publishers  | date = 2001  | location = Quezon City  | isbn = 978-971-10-1069-0  }}</ref>

===Spanish colonial period===
On May 19, 1571, [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] took formal possession of the [[Rajahnate of Maynila]] and its surrounding polities in the name of the Spanish crown.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

Of the many religious orders that came, it was the [[Augustinian Order]] who would figure predominantly in the evangelisation of Pasay. Having control over Pasay, they converted the area into an extensive agricultural estate known as the Hacienda de Meysapan.<ref name="travelcity" /> The parish of Pasay was governed from the old Namayan capital, since renamed Santa Ana de Sapa, which was under the jurisdiction of the [[Order of Friars Minor|Franciscans]]. The promise of space in [[Heaven]] prompted early native converts to donate their possessions to the Church, with folklore recounting how a baptized Pasay on her deathbed donated her vast estate to the Augustinians. Most of Pasay went to friar's hands either via donation or by purchase; many natives were also forced to divest of their properties to cope with stringent colonial impositions. 

In 1727, the Augustinians formally took over Pasay and transferred it from [[Santa Ana, Manila|Santa Ana de Sapa]] to [[Malate, Manila|Malate]], particularly under the jurisdiction of the [[Malate Church|Parish of Nuestra Señora de los Remedios]].<ref name="aimhigh2008" /> In 1815, it was separated from Malate.<ref name="RizalProvinceDirectory1934" />

In 1862, notable residents of Pasay submitted a petition to handle their political and religious matters independently, proposing to rename the town ''"Pineda"'', in honor of ''[[Don (honorific)|Don]]'' Cornelio Pineda, a Spanish [[horticulturist]] who was their benefactor. On December 2, 1863, with the recommendation of [[Archbishop of Manila|Manila Archbishop]] Gregorio Melitón Martínez Santa Cruz, Pineda was granted its own municipal charter, and this date is celebrated yearly as the city's official foundation day.

=== Philippine revolutionary period ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2022}}
Pasay produced numerous heroes during the [[Philippine Revolution]]. The [[Katipunan]], the organization founded by [[Andrés Bonifacio]] that spearheaded the revolution, had a chapter in Pineda organized by Pascual Villanueva, Jacinto Ignacio, and Valentin Ignacio. Several women also fought for the cause of the [[Katipunan]] including [[Marcela Marcelo]]. The execution of [[José Rizal]], who authored the novels ''[[Noli me tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'' and ''[[El Filibusterismo]]'' (considered seditious by the colonial government) on December 30, 1896, fanned the flames of the Revolution.

===American colonial period===
General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] meanwhile declared the independence of the [[First Philippine Republic]] on June 12, 1898, and issued decrees providing political reorganization in the country. With this, ''Don'' Catalino became Pasay's first ''Presidente municipal'' (equivalent to present-day Mayor).{{cn|date=August 2024}} 

Pineda was made the command outpost of the ''Primera Zona de Manila'' under Gen. [[Mariano Noriel]], but Gen. [[Wesley Merritt]] appealed that the Pineda outpost turned over to the Americans so that they could be closer to the Spanish lines. Thinking Americans were allies, Noriel left Pineda on July 29, allowing American General Greene to transfer. When Intramuros was finally captured, the Filipinos were denied entry to the walled city.{{cn|date=August 2024}} Since then, tension simmered between Filipino and American troops, with both sides assigned respective zones but neither observed boundary lines. On the night of February 4, 1899, four Filipinos crossed the American line in [[Santa Mesa, Manila]], and shots were exchanged, triggering the [[Philippine–American War]].{{cn|date=August 2024}} 

On May 19, 1899, General Noriel was given command again of Pineda. In June, Noriel together with General Ricarte almost defeated the American forces had they exploited the exhaustion of the enemy in the Battle of Las Piñas. Instead, their forces were attacked by American reinforcements and bombarded by warships. The assault forced them to abandon Pineda to occupation by American forces.{{cn|date=August 2024}}

On June 11, 1901, Pineda was incorporated into the [[Rizal (province)|Province of Rizal]]. Pascual Villanueva was appointed as municipal president. On August 4, 1901, the Pineda municipal council passed a resolution petitioning that the original name of Pasay be returned. On September 6, 1901, the [[Philippine Commission]], acting on the request of the townsfolk, passed Act No. 227 renaming Pineda back to Pasay.<ref>{{cite PH act| chamber = Act| number = 227| url = http://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l8b8a| title = An Act Changing the Name of the Pueblo of Pineda, in the Province of Rizal, to That of Pasay| date = September 6, 1901| access-date = December 2, 2017| publisher = Lawyerly.ph| archive-date = December 2, 2017| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171202102818/http://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l8b8a| url-status = live}}</ref> Two years later, on October 12, 1903, Act No. 942 merged Pasay with the southern municipality of Malibay, expanding its territory.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=942|date=October 12, 1903|url=http://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l89ad|title=An Act Reducing the Thirty-two Municipalities of the Province of Rizal to Fifteen|access-date=December 2, 2017|publisher=Lawyerly.ph|archive-date=December 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202102820/http://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l89ad|url-status=live}}</ref> With a population of 8,100 in 1903, Pasay was placed under the fourth-class category together with 9 other municipalities.

Friar lands, then nationalized, were turned into subdivisions. Soon, the Pasay Real Estate Company offered friar lands as residential lots for sale or for lease to foreign investors. Postal, telegraph, and telephone lines were installed, and branches of Philippine Savings Bank were established. In 1907, a first-class road from Pasay to Camp Nichols was completed. Others were repaired including the old Avenida Mexico, now called the [[Taft Avenue]] extension. Transportation services improved. Among the first buses plying routes to Pasay were Pasay Transportation, Raymundo Transportation, Try-tran, and Halili Transit.

By 1908, [[Meralco]] [[tranvia]] (electric [[tram]] car) lines linked Pasay to [[Intramuros]], [[Escolta Street|Escolta]], [[San Miguel, Manila|San Miguel]], San Sebastian, and [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]]. Automobiles took to the streets, testing their maximum {{convert|20|kph|abbr=on}} speed on Taft Avenue.{{cn|date=August 2024}}  On April 11, 1914, Cora Wong, a nurse at the Chinese General Hospital, became the first woman in the Philippines to fly as a passenger on a flight with [[Tom Gunn]] in a Curtiss seaplane off Pasay Beach.{{cn|date=August 2024}} 

Much of the bayside area beyond Luneta was swamp but American ex-soldiers were quick to seize the opportunity to develop it for residential purposes. By 1918, Pasay had a population of 18,697 because of the exodus of prominent Filipino families and government officials to this seaside town including future president [[Manuel L. Quezon]]. By the 1930s, the former rural town had become a suburb of the capital city.{{cn|date=August 2024}} 

From the 1900s up to the mid-1930s, [[Philippine National Railway]] services reached Pasay thru its Cavite Line.{{cn|date=August 2024}}

===Japanese occupation ===
[[File:City of Greater Manila map.jpg|thumb|Map of the City of Greater Manila in 1942, depicting the northern part of present-day Pasay included, while the southern portion is under the ''Sakura Heiyei'' military reservation.]]
[[World War II]] came and on December 26, 1941, General [[Douglas MacArthur]] issued a proclamation declaring Manila and its suburbs (Caloocan, Quezon City, San Juan, Mandaluyong, Makati, and Pasay) an [[open city]]. On New Year's Day 1942, Quezon, while in [[Corregidor]], established the [[City of Greater Manila]], wherein Pasay, along with other nearby towns of Rizal, was merged with Manila and [[Quezon City]].<ref name="emb">{{cite web|title=Historical Background|url=http://ncr.emb.gov.ph/historicalbackground/|website=DENR - Environment Management Bureau - National Capital Region|access-date=May 29, 2022|archive-date=April 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402134109/http://ncr.emb.gov.ph/historicalbackground/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=EO|number=400, s. 1942|title=Creating the City of Greater Manila|date=January 1, 1942|accessdate=August 24, 2022|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1942/01/01/executive-order-no-400-s-1942/|archive-date=July 1, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220701173652/https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1942/01/01/executive-order-no-400-s-1942/|url-status=live}}</ref> He called his secretary [[Jorge B. Vargas]] and appointed him by executive order "the Mayor of Greater Manila". The mayor of Pasay was then Rufino Mateo, who was concurrently the district chief of Pasay under the City of Greater Manila, governing a town of more than 55,161. During the WWII, many Pasayeños joined in the fight against the Japanese. Jose P. Maibag, born and bred in Pasay, laid out underground networking. Carlos Mendoza, a resident of Barrio San Roque, together with 14 others, formed a mobile broadcasting station called "The Voice of Juan dela Cruz." On July 11, 1942, Japanese military police captured the group. Carling Mendoza, alias Juan de la Cruz" and other members of the group were brought to the [[Manila City Jail|old Bilibid Prison]] and were tortured.

Pasay had to redo the signs all over town, with Filipino was ordered to prevail over English. The national language became a core subject in the secondary school curriculum, while Japanese was taught as well at all levels of education. On October 14, 1943, Japan proclaimed the [[Second Philippine Republic]]. In the meantime, food had become so scarce that prices soared. Pasay residents began to move away from the city to the provinces outside. The [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation forces]] dissolved the City of Greater Manila in 1944 with the establishment of the [[Philippine Executive Commission]] to govern occupied regions in the country,<ref name="emb"/> thus separating the consolidated cities and towns, with Pasay returning to the province of Rizal. In the middle of February up to early March 1945, as the combined Allied forces began to converge on the way to the Manila area northwards from the south, Pasay suffered enormous damage during the month-long [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]], and many residents perished either by the Japanese or friendly fire from the combined Filipino and American forces.

On February 27, 1945, General MacArthur turned over the government to President [[Sergio Osmeña]]. One of Osmeña's first acts was to dissolve the Greater Manila Complex. He then appointed [[Juan Salcedo Jr.]], born in Pasay in 1904, as Director of Philippine Health, and then as executive officer of the Philippine Rehabilitation Administration in charge of national recovery from the devastation wrought by the Japanese occupation. Osmeña appointed Adolfo Santos as prewar vice mayor of Pasay, in place of incumbent Moises San Juan who died during the war. He also issued an executive order that would dissolve the City of Greater Manila effective August 1, 1945, thus reinstating Pasay's pre-war status as a municipality of Rizal.<ref name="eo58">{{cite PH act|chamber=EO|number=58, s. 1945|title=Reducing the Territory of the City of Greater Manila|date=July 26, 1945|accessdate=August 24, 2022|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1945/07/26/executive-order-no-58-s-1945/|archive-date=March 8, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230308195829/https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1945/07/26/executive-order-no-58-s-1945/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Philippine independence===
====Cityhood====

Ignacio Santos-Diaz, a congressman from the [[Rizal's 1st congressional district|first district of Rizal]], pushed for the conversion of the town into a city and it to be named after Rizal. Republic Act No. 183 was signed into law by President [[Manuel Roxas]] on June 21, 1947, officially establishing '''Rizal City''',<ref name="RA183">{{cite PH act |chamber=RA |number=183 |title=An Act Creating The Rizal City |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno183.html |access-date=April 3, 2018 |language=en |date=June 21, 1947 |archive-date=October 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181014174516/http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno183.html |url-status=live }}</ref> named after [[José Rizal]], with Mateo Rufino as mayor and a population of 88,738. As of June 1948, the city had revenues of {{Philippine peso|472,835|1948}}. But the residents could not get themselves to call their city by its new name. After two years, eight months, and twelve days of trying, the force of habit prevailed and Eulogio Rodriguez Jr., Santos-Diaz's successor, filed a bill returning the city to its original name. On June 7, 1950, President [[Elpidio Quirino]], once a resident of Pasay himself, signed into law Republic Act No. 437, which changed the name of Rizal City to '''Pasay City'''.<ref name="RA437">{{cite PH act |chamber=RA |number=437 |title=An Act Changing the Name of Rizal City to Pasay City |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno437.html |access-date=April 3, 2018 |language=en |date=June 7, 1950 |archive-date=January 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128150033/http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno437.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

It was also in the 1940s when houses of faith were constructed in different parts of Pasay. Among them was the Church of Our Lady of Sorrows, the Libreria de San Pablo Catholic Women's League, Caritas, the nutrition center, and the grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes. In 1951, two parishes were established: the Parish of San Isidro Labrador and the Parish of San Rafael. By that time, the city was once more the aviation center of the country when what is now [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] opened its doors in 1948.

On June 14, 1955, Pasay regained its power to choose its leader. [[Pablo Cuneta]] ran against one-time Mayor Adolfo Santos and became the city's first elected mayor. In 1959, he campaigned again and won against his former vice mayor, Ruperto Galvez. On December 30, 1965, Ferdinand Marcos was sworn in as President of the Philippines, with [[Fernando Lopez]], a resident of Pasay, as vice president. From that moment, [[Imelda Marcos|Imelda Romualdez Marcos]], the then First Lady, became involved in national affairs. On the northern boundary of Pasay, she started filling the waterfront on Manila Bay to build the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]]. In the later decades she would add three more architectural showpieces on reclaimed land in Pasay: the [[Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas|Folk Arts Theater]], [[Manila Film Center]], and the [[Philippine International Convention Center]], and later on the PhilCite Exhibition Hall, the basis of what is now [[Star City (amusement park)|Star City]]. The city, though, was also being groomed as a television center for the country, for in 1958, [[ABS-CBN]] had opened its brand new television studios on what is now [[Roxas Boulevard]] with state-of-the-art equipment, the studios, with color-ready equipment and cameras from Japan plus a number of video recording equipment, were handed over in 1969 to the [[Radio Philippines Network]], which used them until a 1973 fire which ruined the studios, as ABS-CBN had moved northward into Quezon City with the opening of its [[ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center|current studios and offices]].

In 1967, Jovito Claudio won the city elections as chief executive against Pablo Cuneta. In the following year, an [[Pope Paul VI#Attempted assassination|assassination attempt]] occurred in Pasay when a Bolivian surrealist painter lunged at [[Pope Paul VI]], with a knife grazing his chest. In 1971, Cuneta was re-elected as city mayor of a growing city of almost 90 thousand people.

====Martial law era====
{{more citations needed section|date=July 2019}}
On December 7, 1972, almost two months after martial law was declared, an assassin tried to kill Imelda Marcos. The event took place in Pasay, on live television, while Mrs. Marcos was distributing prizes to the winners of the National Beautification and Cleanliness contest. She suffered some wounds and broken nails but on the whole, she emerged unscathed from that close encounter. On the second anniversary of martial law, Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 557, declaring every barrio in the country as barangays.<ref>{{cite PH act |chamber=PD |number=557 |title=Declaring All Barrios in The Philippines as Barangays, and For Other Purposes |url=https://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1974/pd_557_1974.html |website=The LawPhil Project |publisher=Arellano Law Foundation |access-date=January 6, 2020 |date=September 21, 1974 |archive-date=January 9, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200109142404/https://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1974/pd_557_1974.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Not long after the decree had been put into effect, the Metropolitan Manila Commission and the Department of Local Government instructed Pasay to create its own barangays. Mayor Cuneta, in response, ordered the creation of 487 barangays. Upon the firm suggestion of [[Secretary of the Interior and Local Government|Local Government and Community Development Secretary]] Jose Roño, the number of barangays was cut down to two hundred, organized into several zones.

On November 7, 1975, Marcos appointed the First Lady, Imelda, as [[governor of Metro Manila]]. The federation consolidated 13 towns and 4 cities including Pasay, which was removed from Rizal province.<ref name="PD824">{{cite PH act|chamber=PD|number=824|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1975/pd_824_1975.html|title=Creating the Metropolitan Manila and the Metropolitan Manila Commission and for Other Purposes|date=November 7, 1975 |access-date=July 10, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312121648/http://lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1975/pd_824_1975.html|archive-date=March 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Pasay was the host city of [[Miss Universe 1974]], the first time this event had been held in the morning and in the Asia Pacific, and thus was in the international spotlight in the leadup to the pageant day.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Requintina|first1=Robert|title=PH eyes MOA or Philippine Arena as venue for Miss Universe 2016|url=http://tempo.com.ph/2016/08/02/ph-eyes-moa-or-philippine-arena-as-venue-for-miss-universe-2016/|newspaper=Tempo|access-date=August 2, 2016|language=en, fil|date=August 2, 2016|archive-date=May 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190512165302/http://tempo.com.ph/2016/08/02/ph-eyes-moa-or-philippine-arena-as-venue-for-miss-universe-2016/|url-status=live}}</ref> Half a decade later, the city's first family would become famous nationally in the music scene: [[Sharon Cuneta|Sharon]], the then young daughter of the mayor, broke out into the spotlight as a singer with the release of the LP ''DJ's Pet''.

On December 22, 1979, along with [[Manila]], [[Quezon City]], [[Caloocan]], and other cities in the country, Pasay became a highly urbanized city.

In 1981, LRT Line 1 opened its Pasay stations, including its [[Baclaran station|Baclaran terminal]] on the Parañaque border, marking a return to rapid urban rail.

====EDSA people power====
{{more citations needed section|date=July 2019}}
The situation changed in the city in the immediate aftermath of the [[People Power Revolution]]. Cuneta left his post to be replaced by two acting mayors, Eduardo Calixto and Norman Urbina, only to be reelected in 1988 and serving for three more terms, before handing over to [[Jovito Claudio]] in 1998. Upon the end of his term, he was the city's longest ever city mayor. Claudio, himself replaced by the then vice mayor [[Wenceslao Trinidad|Wenceslao "Peewee" Trinidad]] in [[2000 Pasay mayoral recall election|2000]], saw the building of the [[MRT Line 3 (Metro Manila)|MRT Line 3]]'s southern terminus in the city, linked to the LRT Line 1 along Taft Avenue, and the Pasay City General Hospital and [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 2]] were both opened to the public. All these and other projects spurred a new era of growth in the city that continues to this day. The EDSA Entertainment Complex, located just to the city's west along [[EDSA]], just miles from the [[Baclaran, Parañaque]], for many years now is very well known for adult entertainment, including [[prostitution]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Coorlim |first1=Leif |title=Undercover journalists trawl Manila's seedy red light district |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/06/world/asia/freedom-fighters-undercover/index.html |website=CNN |access-date=January 31, 2019 |date=May 16, 2013 |archive-date=January 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190116201839/http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/06/world/asia/freedom-fighters-undercover/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="A Farang Abroad">{{cite web |title=Starter Guide To Manila Red Light District |url=https://afarangabroad.com/manila-red-light-district/ |website=A Farang Abroad |access-date=January 31, 2019 |archive-date=August 26, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220826132757/https://afarangabroad.com/manila-red-light-district/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2006, the [[SM Mall of Asia]], the largest shopping center overall in the country, was opened, and the area around this mall began to grow into the city's business center in subsequent years that followed, followed by the opening of the city's biggest sports venue, the [[SM Mall of Asia Arena|Mall of Asia Arena]]. Two years later, the NAIA Terminal 3 opened its doors in July 2008, and within two years, progress blossomed in the vicinity with the opening of yet another residential and entertainment hub, [[Newport City, Metro Manila|Newport City]], strengthened by the construction of the NAIA Expressway in 2016.
