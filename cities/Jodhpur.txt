== History ==

=== Early history ===
Jodhpur city was founded in 1459 by [[Rao Jodha|Rao Jodha Rathore]]. Jodha succeeded in conquering the surrounding territory from the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and thus founded a kingdom that came to be known as [[Kingdom of Marwar|Marwar]].<ref>{{Cite book|first=Tanuja|last=Kothiyal|title=Nomadic Narratives: A History of Mobility and Identity in the Great Indian|publisher=Cambridgr University Press|year=2016|isbn=9781107080317|pages=76|quote=the Rathor strongholds came under attack from the Delhi Sultanate especially as Nagaur, Jalore and Siwana became garrisons of the sultanate. Years later, Jodha succeeded on forging alliances with Deoras, Eendas, Sanklas and Bhatis from Janglu, Pugal and Jaisalmer. Subsequently Merta, Phalodi, Pokhran, Bhadrajun, Sojat, Jaitaran, Siwana, Nagaur and Godwar were permanently added to the Rathor territory, thus making Marwar the most powerful kingdom in Rajputana.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=be-7CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA78}}</ref> As Jodha hailed from the nearby town of [[Mandore]], that town initially served as the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of this state; however, Jodhpur soon took over that role, even during the lifetime of Jodha. The city was located on the strategic road linking [[Delhi]] to [[Gujarat]]. This enabled it to profit from a flourishing trade in [[opium]], [[copper]], [[silk]], [[sandalwood]], [[date (fruit)|dates]], and other tradeable goods.<ref name=history1>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SktuAAAAMAAJ|title=The House of Marwar: The Story of Jodhpur|author=Dhananajaya Singh|publisher=Lotus Collection |year=1994|isbn=9788174360021}}</ref>

=== Early modern period ===
{{Main|Rajput War (1679–1707)|Rajput Rebellion (1708–1710)}}
After the death of Rao [[Chandrasen Rathore]] in 1581, the kingdom was annexed by the Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]], Marwar thus became a Mughal vassal, owing [[fealty]] to them while enjoying internal [[autonomy]]. Jodhpur and its people benefited from this exposure to the wider world as new styles of [[Indian art|art]] and [[Indian Architecture|architecture]] made their appearance and opportunities opened up for local tradesmen to make their mark across northern India.<ref name=history1/>

[[File:JODHPUR 1960.jpg|thumb|View of the Rajasthan High Court, Sardar Museum in Umaid Park and upper right is Jodhpur fort in 1960.|left]]
[[Aurangzeb]] briefly sequestrated the state (''circa'' 1679) after the death of [[Maharaja Jaswant Singh]], but his son [[Ajit Singh of Marwar|Maharaja Ajit Singh]] was restored to the throne by [[Durgadas Rathore]] at the death of Aurangzeb in 1707 ending the 30 year long Rathore rebellion. The [[Mughal empire]] declined gradually after 1707, but the Jodhpur court was beset by intrigue; rather than benefiting from circumstances, Marwar descended into strife and invited the intervention of the [[Maratha]]s, who soon supplanted the Mughals as overlords of the region. In 1755 [[Jayappaji Rao Scindia|Jai Appa Scindia]] attacked Nagaur after looting several places of Rajasthan. Jai Appa halted his army near samas pond of Tausar which was 3.5&nbsp;km from Nagaur fort. He surrounded Nagaur fort and cut off food and water supply. Maharaja Vijay Singh called Darbar and asked for volunteers to kill Scindia. Gaji Khan Khokhar (Chawata Kallan) and Kan Singh (Dotalai) volunteered and took responsibility for killing Jaiappa Scindia. Both changed their outfit as traders and opened shop near Jaiappa's army. They observed their activities for two month. On 25 July 1755 on Friday at 11 am, when found opportunity attacked Jaiappa with daggers and killed him (Painting situated in Mandore museum). While fighting the loyal soldiers of Jodhpur both were killed. From then on a common proverb still people say "Khokhar bada khuraki kha gaya appa jaisa daaki" (Khokhar are great gluttons, eaten demon like appa). Even after the killing of Jai Appa Sindhia, the Maratha army continued fighting for a few months near Nagaur but they lost hope after Jai Appa's death.
Dissipated the wealth of the state, which sought the help of the British and entered into a [[subsidiary alliance]] with them.<ref name=history1/><ref name="ReferenceA">Political Awakening and Indian Freedom Movement with Special Reference to Rajasthan pg 28-35</ref>

=== British colonial period ===
A major revolt occurred in [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|1857]] by some Rathore nobles of [[Pali, Rajasthan|Pali]] led by Thakur [[Kushal Singh of Auwa]], but the rebels were defeated by the British Army under Colonel Holmes and peace was restored.<ref name=history1/><ref name="ReferenceA"/>

[[File:Street Scene of Jodhpur India 1906.jpg|thumb|Street Scene of Jodhpur in 1906|left]]

During the [[British Raj]], the state of Jodhpur had the largest land area in the [[Rajputana]]. The land area of the state was {{convert|93424|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} its population in 1901 was 44,73,759. It enjoyed an estimated revenue of [[£]]3,529,000. Its merchants, the [[Marwaris]], flourished and came to occupy a position of dominance in trade across India.

=== After independence ===
In 1947, when [[Dominion of India|India]] became independent, the state merged into the union, and Jodhpur became the second-largest city of Rajasthan.<ref name="history1" /><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lF0FvjG3GWEC|title=The Rajputs of Rajputana: A Glimpse of Medieval Rajasthan|author=Dr. M.S. Navarane| publisher=APH Publishing |year=1999|isbn=81-7648-118-1}}</ref> At the time of division, the ruler of Jodhpur, [[Hanwant Singh]], did not want to join India, but finally, due to the effective persuasion of [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] at the time, the state of Jodhpur was included in the Indian Republic. Later after the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956|State Reorganisation Act, 1956]] came into effect, it was included within the state of Rajasthan.<ref name="history1" />

== Geography and climate ==
Jodhpur has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BWh''), due to its very high [[potential evapotranspiration]]. Although the average rainfall is around {{convert|362|mm|in|abbr=on}}, which falls mostly from June to September, it fluctuates greatly. In the [[famine in India|famine]] year of 1899, Jodhpur received only {{convert|24|mm|in|abbr=on}}, but in the flood year of 1917, it received as much as {{convert|1178|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Jojari river, a tributary of Luni River, flows from [[Banar|Banad]] to Salawas in Jodhpur Urban Area. A Riverfront project is approved and is in Planning for this river for 35&nbsp;km length coming inside Jodhpur Urban Area which is under Namami Ganga Project of [[Ministry of Jal Shakti]] from January 2021, earlier this project was under Jodhpur Development Authority. Pin Code of Jodhpur is 342001 which comes under Jodhpur postal division (Jodhpur Region).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://webconte.com/pin_code/place/jodhpur_city/4319|title=Pin Code Jodhpur City, Jodhpur - Post Office 342001|website=WebConte}}</ref>

Temperatures are extreme from March to October, except when the [[Tropical cyclone|monsoonal rain]] produces thick [[cloud]]s to lower it slightly. In April, May, and June, high temperatures routinely exceed 40&nbsp;°C. During the monsoon season, average temperatures decrease slightly, but the city's generally low humidity rises, which adds to the perception of the heat.
The highest temperature recorded in Jodhpur was on 20 May 2016, when it rose to {{Convert|48.8|C|F}}.
