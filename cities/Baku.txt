==Etymology==
Baku is long attested under the [[Perso-Arabic]] name باکو (''Bākū''). Early [[Arabic language|Arabic]] sources also refer to the city as ''Bākuh'' and ''Bākuya'',<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Dunlop |first1=D.M. |url=http://nessia.org/files/original/7fb5287183e94fb6ea34e8c74d7f9de9.pdf |title=Historic Cities of the Islamic World |last2=Bennigsen |first2=A. |last3=Bosworth |first3=C.E. |publisher=Brill |year=2007 |editor-last=Bosworth |editor-first=C.

This popular name (''Badkubə'' in modern Azerbaijani script) gained currency as a nickname for the city by the 19th century (e.g., it is used in ''[[Akinchi]]'', volume 1, issue 1, p.&nbsp;1), and is also reflected in the city's modern nickname as the "City of Winds" ({{langx|az|Küləklər şəhəri|link=no}}). Another and even less probable folk etymology explains the name as deriving from ''Baghkuy'', meaning "God's town". ''Baga'' (now ''بغ'' ''bagh'') and ''kuy'' are the [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] words for "god" and "town" respectively; the name ''Baghkuy'' may be compared with ''[[Baghdad|Baghdād]]'' ("God-given") in which ''dād'' is the Old Persian word for "give".

During [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet rule]], the city was spelled in Cyrillic as "Бакы" in Azerbaijani (while the [[Russian language|Russian]] spelling was and still is "Баку", ''{{transliteration|ru|Baku}}''). The modern Azerbaijani spelling, which has been using the Latin alphabet since 1991, is {{lang|az|Bakı}}; the shift from the Perso-Arabic letter و (''ū'') to Cyrillic "ы" and, later, Latin "ı" may be compared to that in other Azerbaijani words (e.g. compare {{wikt-lang|az|قاپو}} ''qāpū'' in old Perso-Arabic spelling with modern Azerbaijani {{wikt-lang|az|qapı}}, "door") or in suffixes, as و was often used to transcribe the [[vowel harmony]] in Azerbaijani (which was also the practice in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]). (See also [[Azerbaijani alphabet]].)

Traces of human settlement in the region of present-day Baku date back to the [[Stone Age]]. [[Bronze-Age]] rock carvings have been discovered near Bayil, and a bronze figure of a small fish in the territory of the Old City. These have led some to suggest the existence of a Bronze-Age settlement within the city's territory.<ref>[http://azerisite.narod.ru/2.html Город Баку...] {{Webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140319033931/http://azerisite.narod.ru/2.html |date= 19 March 2014 }} Retrieved on 24 June 2006</ref> Near [[Nardaran]], a place called Umid Gaya features a prehistoric observatory, where images of the sun and of various constellations are carved into rock together with a primitive astronomic table.<ref>Ancient Observatory of Absheron.

In the 1st century AD, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] organised two Caucasian campaigns and reached what is today Baku.

Baku was the realm of the [[Shirvanshahs]] during the 8th century AD. The city frequently came under assault from the [[Khazars]] and (starting from the 10th century) from the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']]. [[Akhsitan I ibn Minuchihr III|Shirvanshah Akhsitan I]] built a navy in Baku and successfully repelled a Rus' assault in 1170. After a devastating earthquake struck [[Shamakhi]], the capital of [[Shirvan]], Shirvanshah's court moved to Baku in 1191.<ref>[http://www.kaspiy.az/rubrics.php?code=316 "Ичери Шехер": быть или не быть] Retrieved on 25 June 2006 {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080620120625/http://www.kaspiy.az/rubrics.php?code=316 |date= 20 June 2008 }}</ref>

[[File:Sabayil relics.jpg|thumb|Relics from the sunken [[Sabayil Castle]] ]]
The Shirvan era greatly influenced Baku and the remainder of present-day Azerbaijan. Between the 12th and 14th centuries, massive fortifications were built in Baku and the surrounding towns. The [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]], the [[Ramana Tower]], the [[Nardaran Fortress]], the Shagan Castle, the [[Quadrangular castle (Mardakan)|Mardakan Castle]], the [[Round Castle (Mardakan)|Round Castle]] and also the [[Sabayil Castle]] on the island of the [[Bay of Baku]] date from this period. The [[Old City (Baku)|city walls of Baku]] were also rebuilt and strengthened.

By the early 16th century, Baku's wealth and strategic position attracted the attention of its larger neighbours; in the previous two centuries, it was under the rule of the Iran-centred [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ak Koyunlu]]. The fall of the Ak Koyunlu brought the city immediately into the sphere of the newly formed Iranian [[Safavid dynasty]], led by king (''[[shah]]'') [[Ismail I]] ({{reign | 1501 | 1524}}). Ismail I laid siege to Baku in 1501 and captured it; he allowed the Shirvanshahs to remain in power, under Safavid suzerainty. His successor, king [[Tahmasp I]] ({{reign | 1524 | 1576}}), completely removed the Shirvanshahs from power and made Baku a part of the [[Safavid Shirvan|Shirvan]] province. Baku remained as an integral part of his empire and of successive Iranian dynasties for the next centuries, until ceded to the [[Russian Empire]] through the 1813 [[Treaty of Gulistan]]. The House of Shirvan, which had ruled Baku since the 9th century, was extinguished in the course of Safavid rule.

At this time, the city was enclosed within lines of strong walls, which were washed by the sea on one side and protected by a wide trench on land. The Ottomans briefly gained control over Baku as a result of the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–1590)|Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578–1590]]; by 1607, it came under Iranian control again.<ref>{{Cite book |last1= Dumper |first1= Michael |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&pg=PA65 |title= Cities of the Middle East and North Africa |last2= Stanley |first2= Bruce E |publisher= ABC-CLIO |year= 2007 |isbn= 978-1-57607-919-5 |access-date= 4 July 2020 |archive-date= 28 May 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210528124515/https://books.google.com/books?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&pg=PA65 |url-status= live }}</ref> In 1604 Shah [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] ({{reign | 1588 | 1629}}) destroyed Baku fortress.

Baku had a reputation as a focal point for traders from across the world during the [[Early modern period]]; commerce was active and the area prospered. Notably, traders from the [[Indian subcontinent]] established themselves in the region.

=== Downfall of the Safavids and the Khanate of Baku ===
The Safavids temporarily lost power in Iran in 1722; Emperor [[Peter the Great]] of Russia took advantage of the situation and invaded.

[[File:Баку. Набережная. 1861.jpg|left|270px|thumb|Painting of Baku's shoreline in 1861 by [[Alexey Bogolyubov]]]]

From the late 18th century, Imperial Russia switched to a more aggressive geopolitical stance towards its two neighbours and rivals to the south, namely Iran and the Ottoman Empire.

On 13 June 1796, a Russian flotilla entered Baku Bay, and a garrison of Russian troops was stationed inside the city. Later, however, Emperor [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] of Russia ordered the cessation of the campaign and the withdrawal of Russian forces following the death of his predecessor, [[Catherine the Great]]. In March 1797 the tsarist troops left Baku and the city became part of [[Qajar Iran]] again.

In 1813, following the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–13)|Russo-Persian War of 1804–1813]], Qajar Iran had to sign the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] with Russia this provided for the cession of Baku and of most of Iran's territories in the [[North Caucasus]] and [[South Caucasus]] to Russia. During the next and final bout of hostilities between the two, the [[Russo-Persian War (1826–28)|Russo-Persian War of 1826–1828]], the Iranians briefly recaptured Baku.

Professor [[A. V. Williams Jackson]] of Columbia University wrote in his work ''From Constantinople to the Home of Omar Khayyam'' (1911):
{{blockquote|Baku is a city founded upon oil, for to its inexhaustible founts of naphtha it owes its very existence, its maintenance, its prosperity... At present Baku produces one-fifth of the oil that is used in the world, and the immense output in crude petroleum from this single city far surpasses that in any other district where oil is found. Verily, the words of the Scriptures find illustration here: 'the rock poured me out rivers of oil.

Oil is in the air one breathes, in one's nostrils, in one's eyes, in the water of the morning bath (though not in the drinking water, for that is brought in bottles from distant mineral springs), in one's starched linen – everywhere. This is the impression one carries away from Baku, and it is certainly true in the environs.<ref>Abraham Valentine Williams Jackson. {{Cite web |title= From Constantinople to the Home of Omar Khayyam |url= https://archive.org/stream/fromconstantino00jackgoog#page/n10/mode/2up |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120318114642/http://www.archive.org/stream/fromconstantino00jackgoog#page/n10/mode/2up |archive-date= 18 March 2012 |access-date= 1 December 2011 |publisher= The Macmillan Company | year = 1911 | page = 25}}</ref>}}

In 1917, after the [[October Revolution]] and amidst the turmoil of [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Revolution]], Baku came under the control of the [[26 Baku Commissars|Baku Commune]], led by the veteran Bolshevik [[Stepan Shahumyan]]. Seeking to capitalize on the existing ethnic conflicts, by spring 1918, Bolsheviks inspired and condoned civil war in and around Baku. During the [[March Days]] of 1918, Bolsheviks and [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnaks]], seeking to establish control over Baku streets, faced armed Azerbaijani groups. The Azerbaijanis suffered defeat from the united forces of the Baku Soviet and were massacred by Dashnak teams in what was called the [[March Days]]. An estimated 3,000–12,000 Azerbaijanis were killed in their own capital.<ref name="smithmusavat">{{Cite journal |last= Smith |first= Michael |date= April 2001 |title= Anatomy of Rumor: Murder Scandal, the Musavat Party and Narrative of the Russian Revolution in Baku, 1917–1920 |journal= Journal of Contemporary History |volume= 36 |issue= 2 |page= 228 |doi= 10.1177/002200940103600202 |quote= ''The results of the March events were immediate and total for the Musavat.

=== Soviet period ===
The independence of the Azerbaijani republic was a significant but short-lived chapter in Baku's history. On 28 April 1920, the [[11th Army (RSFSR)|11th Red Army]] [[Red Army invasion of Azerbaijan|invaded]] Baku and reinstalled the Bolsheviks, making Baku the capital of the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]].

The city underwent many major changes. As a result, Baku played a great role in many branches of Soviet life. Baku was the major oil city of the Soviet Union. From about 1921 the city was headed by the Baku City Executive Committee, commonly known in Russian as ''Bakgorispolkom''. Together with Baku Party Committee (known as the ''Baksovet''), it developed the economic significance of the Caspian metropolis. From 1922 to 1930 Baku became the venue for one of the major [[trade fair]]s of the Soviet Union, serving as a commercial bridgehead to Iran and the Middle East.<ref>Etienne Forestier-Peyrat, "[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/ab_imperio/summary/v2013/2013.4.forestier-peyrat.html Red Passage to Iran: Baku Trade Fair and the Unmaking of the Azerbaijani Borderland, 1922–1930] {{Webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304115115/http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/ab_imperio/summary/v2013/2013.4.forestier-peyrat.html |date= 4 March 2016 }}", ''Ab Imperio'', Vol 2013, Issue 4, pp. 79–112.</ref>

=== World War II ===
{{main|Baku during World War II}}
The major powers continued to note Baku's growing importance as a major energy hub. During [[World War II]] (1939–1945) and particularly during the [[Case Blue|1942 Nazi German invasion of the southwestern Soviet Union]], Baku became of vital strategic importance to the [[Axis powers]]. In fact, capturing the [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan#World War II|oil fields of Baku]] was a primary goal of the [[Wehrmacht]]'s [[Operation Edelweiss]], carried out between May and November 1942. However, the [[German Army (1935–1945)|German Army]] reached only a point some {{convert|530|km|0|abbr=off}} northwest of Baku in November 1942, falling far short of the city's capture before being driven back during the Soviet [[Operation Little Saturn]] in mid-December 1942.

=== Fall of the Soviet Union and later ===
After the 1991 [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Baku embarked on a process of restructuring on a scale unseen in its history.<ref>{{Cite web |title= Money from oil changes the face of Azerbaijan |url= http://news.az/articles/society/41029 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110726173757/http://www.news.az/articles/society/41029 |archive-date= 26 July 2011 |access-date= 22 July 2011 |publisher= news.az}}</ref> Thousands of [[Khrushchevka|panel buildings]] from the Soviet period were demolished to make way for a green belt on its shores; parks and gardens were built on the land reclaimed by filling up the beaches of the [[Baku Bay]]. Improvements were made in general cleaning, maintenance, and garbage collection to bring these services up to Western European standards. The city is growing dynamically and developing at pace on an east–west axis along the shores of the [[Caspian Sea]]. Sustainability has become a key factor in future urban development.<ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:Baku, Azerbaijan, satellite image, LandSat-5, 2010-09-06.jpg|thumb|Absheron Peninsula satellite image, [[Landsat 5]], 6 September 2010]]
Baku is situated on the western coast of the [[Caspian Sea]]. In the vicinity of the city there are a number of [[mud volcano]]es (Keyraki, Bogkh-bogkha, [[Lokbatan]] and others) and [[salt lake]]s ([[Lake Boyukshor|Boyukshor]], Khodasan, etc.).

=== Climate ===
Baku has a [[cold semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''BSk'') with hot and humid summers, cool and occasionally wet winters, and strong winds all year long. However, unlike many other cities with such climate features, Baku does not see extremely hot summers and substantial sunshine hours. This is largely because of its northerly [[latitude]] and the fact that it is located on a peninsula on the shore of the Caspian Sea.

Baku, and the [[Absheron Peninsula]] on which it is situated, is the most arid part of Azerbaijan ([[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] here is around or less than {{convert|200|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} a year). This is largely due to the [[rain shadow]] effect from the [[Caucasus Mountains]], with corresponding latitudes on the [[Black Sea]] on average receiving {{convert|2300|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} or more.<!-- Batumi and Rize among others. --> The majority of the light annual precipitation occurs in seasons other than summer, but none of these seasons is particularly wet.

During Soviet times, Baku, with its long hours of sunshine and dry healthy climate, was a vacation destination where citizens could enjoy beaches or relax in now-dilapidated [[destination spa|spa]] complexes overlooking the Caspian Sea. The city's past as a Soviet industrial centre left it one of the most polluted cities in the world, {{As of|2008|lc=y}}.<ref name="ForbesPollution">{{Cite news |last=Tiffany M. Luck |date=26 February 2008 |title=The World's Dirtiest Cities |work=Forbes |url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/02/26/pollution-baku-oil-biz-logistics-cx_tl_0226dirtycities.html |url-status=live |access-date=17 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202072636/http://www.forbes.com/2008/02/26/pollution-baku-oil-biz-logistics-cx_tl_0226dirtycities.html |archive-date=2 December 2010}}</ref>

At the same time, Baku is noted as a very windy city throughout the year, hence the city's nickname the "[[City of Winds]]", and gale-force winds, the cold northern wind ''[[khazri]]'' and the warm southern wind ''[[gilavar]]'' are typical here in all seasons. Indeed, the city is renowned for its fierce winter snow storms and harsh winds.<ref name="Web.archive.org" />
The speed of the ''khazri'' sometimes reaches {{convert|144|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, which can cause damage to crops, trees and roof tiles.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Global ICT Conference: 25–28, November, 2004: Baku, Azerbaijan |url=http://www.global-ict.mincom.gov.az/aboutazerb.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719093010/http://www.global-ict.mincom.gov.az/aboutazerb.php |archive-date=19 July 2011 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Global-ict.mincom.gov.az}}</ref>

The daily mean temperature in July and August averages {{convert|26.4|°C|°F}}, and there is very little rainfall during that season. During summer, the ''khazri'' sweeps through, bringing desired coolness. Winter is cool and occasionally wet, with the daily mean temperature in January and February averaging {{convert|4.3|°C|°F}}. During winter, the ''khazri'' sweeps through, driven by polar [[air mass]]es; temperatures on the coast frequently drop below freezing and make it feel bitterly cold. Winter [[Winter storm|snow storms]] are occasional; [[snow]] usually melts within a few days after each snowfall.

== Demographics ==
Until 1988, Baku had very large Russian, [[Armenian people|Armenian]], and [[Jews|Jewish]] populations which contributed to [[cultural diversity]] and added in various ways (music, literature, architecture and progressive outlook) to Baku's history. With the onset of the [[First Nagorno-Karabakh War]] and the [[Pogrom of Armenians in Baku|pogrom against Armenians]] starting in January 1990, the city's large Armenian population was expelled.<ref>Azerbaijan: The status of Armenians, Russians, Jews and other minorities, report, 1993, INS Resource Informacion Center, p.10</ref><ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Azerbaijan – The Soviet and post-Soviet periods |encyclopedia=Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-44300/Azerbaijan#481451.hook |access-date=17 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418173138/https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-44300/Azerbaijan#481451.hook |archive-date=18 April 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>  After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], [[President of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani President]] [[Heydar Aliyev]] returned several synagogues and a Jewish college, nationalised by the Soviets, to the Jewish community; he encouraged the restoration of these buildings.

=== Ethnic groups ===
[[File:Christmas in Baku on January 6, 1904 and Armenian church.jpg|thumb|The Armenian [[Saint Gregory the Illuminator's Church, Baku]]]]
Today, the vast majority of Baku's population is made up of ethnic [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]], and the rest are [[Talysh people|Talysh]], [[Russians]], [[Lezgins|Lezgi]] and others. The intensive growth of the population started in the middle of the 19th century when Baku was a small town with a population of about 7,000 people. The population increased again from about 13,000 in the 1860s to 112,000 in 1897 and 215,000 in 1913, making Baku the largest city in the Caucasus region.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Country-data.com |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-946.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706060044/http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-946.html |archive-date=6 July 2010 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Country-data.com}}</ref>

Baku has been a cosmopolitan city at certain times during its history, meaning ethnic Azerbaijanis did not constitute the majority of population.<ref>Audrey Altstadt, Conflict, Cleavage and Change in Central Asia and the Caucasus, [[Cambridge University Press]], 1997, p. 112, table 4.1, Ethnic composition of Baku, 1897, 1903,1913</ref> It was only in the 1970s that ethnic Azerbaijanis achieved demographic dominance in Baku.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Goff |first1=Krista A. |title=Nested Nationalism: Making and Unmaking Nations in the Soviet Caucasus |date=2021 |publisher=Cornell University Press |page=28|isbn=978-1501753299}}</ref> In 2003 Baku additionally had 153,400 [[internally displaced person]]s and 93,400 refugees.<ref>{{Cite web |script-title=ru:Баку |url=http://www.baku-online.com/ru/baku.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701132551/http://www.baku-online.com/ru/baku.htm |archive-date=1 July 2007 |access-date=15 July 2007 |language=ru}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Герейханов |first1=Гаджи Пирмурадович |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=360iAQAAIAAJ |title=Угрозы национальной безопасности России на Северном Кавказе: этноконфессиональный аспект |last2=Лукьянов |first2=Алексей Григорьевич |last3=Моренов |first3=Игорь Сергеевич |publisher=Граница |year=2004 |isbn=978-5-94691-100-9 |access-date=5 February 2019 |archive-date=17 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201017135432/https://books.google.com/books?id=360iAQAAIAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Religion ===
[[File:Северная сторона мечети.jpg|thumb|The 13th-century [[Bibi-Heybat Mosque]] was built over the tomb of a descendant of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]].<ref name="Bibi">{{Cite web |last=Sharifov |first=Azad |title=Legend of the Bibi-Heybat Mosque |url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/63_folder/63_articles/63_bibiheybat.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605015723/http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/63_folder/63_articles/63_bibiheybat.html |archive-date=5 June 2011 |access-date=11 July 2010 |publisher=Azerbaijan International Magazine}}</ref>]]
The religion with the largest community of followers is Islam. The majority of the Muslims are [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]], and the Republic of Azerbaijan has the second-highest Shia population percentage in the world, after [[Iran]].<ref>Juan Eduardo Campo, ''Encyclopedia of Islam'', p.625</ref> The city's notable mosques include [[Juma Mosque (Baku)|Juma Mosque]], [[Bibi-Heybat Mosque]], [[Muhammad Mosque (Baku)|Muhammad Mosque]] and [[Taza Pir Mosque]].

There are some other faiths practised among the different ethnic groups within the country. By article 48 of its [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]], Azerbaijan is a [[secular state]] and ensures religious freedom. Religious minorities include [[Russian Orthodox Christians]], [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Catholic Levantines]], [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian Orthodox Christians]], [[Church of Caucasian Albania|Albanian-Udi Apostolic Christians]], [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Azerbaijani Jews|Ashkenazi]] Jews, and [[Sufi]] Muslims. Baku is the seat of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Apostolic Prefecture of Azerbaijan]].

[[Zoroastrianism]], although extinct in the city as well as in the rest of the country by the present time, had a long [[Zoroastrianism in Azerbaijan|history in Azerbaijan]] and the [[Nowruz|Zoroastrian New Year]] (Nowruz) continues to be the main holiday in the city as well as in the rest of Azerbaijan.

[[File:Panorama of Baku 2022.jpg|thumb|[[The Crescent Development project]]]]

Baku's largest industry is petroleum, and its petroleum exports make it a large contributor to Azerbaijan's [[balance of payments]]. The existence of petroleum has been known since the 8th century. In the 10th century, the Arabian traveler, Marudee, reported that both white and black oil were being extracted naturally from Baku.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The History of Oil in Azerbaijan by Natig Aliyev |url=http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/22_folder/22_articles/22_historyofoil.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424163308/http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/22_folder/22_articles/22_historyofoil.html |archive-date=24 April 2009 |access-date=22 May 2009 |publisher=Azer.com}}</ref> By the 15th century, oil for lamps was obtained from hand-dug surface wells.
Commercial exploitation began in 1872, and by the beginning of the 20th century the [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan|Baku oil fields]] were the largest in the world. Towards the end of the 20th century, much of the onshore petroleum had been exhausted, and drilling had extended into the sea offshore. By the end of the 19th century [[skilled worker]]s and specialists flocked to Baku. By 1900 the city had more than 3,000 oil wells, of which 2,000 were producing oil at industrial levels. Baku ranked as one of the largest centres for the production of [[Petroleum industry|oil industry]] equipment before World War II. The World War II [[Battle of Stalingrad]] was fought to determine who would have control of Baku oil fields. Fifty years before the battle, Baku produced half of the world's oil supply.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Aghazade |first=Emil |date=4 July 2005 |title=Азербайджан: сто лет надежд |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/business/newsid_4649000/4649873.stm |url-status=live |access-date=12 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406161830/http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/business/newsid_4649000/4649873.stm |archive-date=6 April 2012}}</ref>

The oil economy of Baku is undergoing a resurgence, with the development of the massive [[Azeri–Chirag–Guneshli|Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli]] field (Shallow water Gunashli by [[State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic|SOCAR]], deeper areas by a consortium led by [[BP]]), development of the [[Shah Deniz gas field]], the expansion of the [[Sangachal Terminal]] and the construction of the [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline|BTC Pipeline]].

The [[Baku Stock Exchange]] is Azerbaijan's largest [[stock exchange]], and largest in the [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] region by [[market capitalization]]. A relatively large number of transnational companies are headquartered in Baku. One of the more prominent institutions headquartered in Baku is the [[International Bank of Azerbaijan]], which employs over 1,000 people. International banks with branches in Baku include [[HSBC]], [[Société Générale]] and [[Credit Suisse]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Abdullayev |first=Rovshan |title=Which foreign banks has Azerbaijan capital been trusted in? |url=http://www.nhmt-az.org/ts_general/eng/news/n-6.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518140408/http://www.nhmt-az.org/ts_general/eng/news/n-6.htm |archive-date=18 May 2011 |access-date=6 December 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Baku, Azerbaiyán, 2016-09-26, DD 207-209 PAN.jpg|thumb|[[Multani Caravanserai]], Baku]]
Baku has wildly varying architecture, ranging from the [[Old City (Baku)|Old City]] core to modern buildings and the spacious layout of Baku port. Many of the city's landmarks were built during the early 20th century, when architectural elements of the European styles were combined in [[eclecticism|eclectic]] style.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Baku's Architecture:A Fusion of East and West |url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/24_folder/24_articles/24_architecture.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116060241/http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/24_folder/24_articles/24_architecture.html |archive-date=16 November 2011 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Azer.com}}</ref> Baku has an original and unique appearance, earning it a reputation as the ''Paris of the East''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.window2baku.com/006development.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515072252/http://www.window2baku.com/006development.htm|title=Общие сведения|archive-date=15 May 2010|website=www.window2baku.com}}</ref> Baku joined [[UNESCO]]'s [[Creative Cities Network|Network of Creative Cities]] as a Design City on 31 October 2019 on the occasion of World Cities' Day.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-10-30 |title=UNESCO celebrates World Cities Day designating 66 new Creative Cities |url=https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-celebrates-world-cities-day-designating-66-new-creative-cities |access-date=2019-11-05 |website=UNESCO |language=en |archive-date=31 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031145734/https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-celebrates-world-cities-day-designating-66-new-creative-cities |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Hamams ====

There are a number of ancient [[Hammam|hamams]] in Baku dating back to the 12th, 14th and 18th centuries. Hamams play a very important role in the architectural appearance of Baku.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gadimova |first=Nazrin |date=8 January 2014 |title=Traditional hamams in all its glory in Baku |url=https://www.azernews.az/travel/62986.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123131702/https://www.azernews.az/travel/62986.html |archive-date=23 January 2018 |access-date=19 May 2017 |website=AzerNews.az |language=en}}</ref>

===== Teze Bey Hamam =====
Teze Bey is the most popular hamam (traditional Islamic bath) in Baku. It was built in 1886 in the centre of Baku, and in 2003 it was fully restored and modernised. Along with its modern amenities, Teze Bey features a swimming pool and architectural details inspired by Oriental, Russian and Finnish baths.

===== Gum Hamam =====
Gum Hamam was discovered during archaeological excavations underneath the sand; hence the name: Gum hamam (sand bath). It was built sometime during the 12th–14th centuries.

===== Bairamali hamam =====
In ancient times, Bairamali Hamam was called "Bey Hamam". The original structure was built sometime during the 12th–14th centuries and was reconstructed in 1881.

===== Agha Mikayil Hamam =====
Agha Mikayil Hamam was constructed in the 18th century by Haji Agha Mikayil on Kichik Gala Street in the Old City (Icherisheher). It is still operating in its ancient setting. The Hamam is open to women on Mondays and Fridays and to men on the other days of the week.<ref>{{Cite web |title=- Icherisheher |url=https://icherisheher.gov.az/en/monument/1 |access-date=2024-06-04 |website=icherisheher.gov.az}}</ref>

==== Modern architecture ====
Late modern and postmodern architecture began to appear in the early 2000s. With economic development, old buildings such as Atlant House were razed to make way for new ones. Buildings with all-glass shells have appeared around the city, the most prominent examples being the International Mugham Center, [[Azerbaijan Tower]], [[Heydar Aliyev Centre|Heydar Aliyev Cultural Centre]], [[Flame Towers]], [[Baku Crystal Hall]], [[Baku White City]], [[SOCAR Tower]] and [[DENIZ Mall]]. These projects also caught the attention of international media as notable programmes such as [[Discovery Channel]]'s [[Extreme Engineering]] did pieces focusing in on changes to the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Heydar Aliyev Cultural Centre And Flame Towers |url=http://science.discovery.com/tv/build-bigger/projects/azerbaijan/heydar-aliyev-cultural-centre.html |access-date=25 April 2011 |publisher=Discovery Communications }}{{dead link|date=September 2022|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

The Old City of Baku, also known as the Walled City of Baku, refers to the ancient Baku settlement. Most of the walls and towers, strengthened after the Russian conquest in 1806, survived. This section is picturesque, with its maze of narrow alleys and ancient buildings: the cobbled streets past the [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs]], two [[Caravanserai|caravansaries]], the baths and the [[Juma Mosque (Baku)|Juma Mosque]] (which used to house the [[Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum|Azerbaijan National Carpet and Arts Museum]] but is now a mosque again). The old town core also has dozens of small mosques, often without any particular sign to distinguish them as such.

In 2003, UNESCO placed the Inner City on the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]], citing damage from a [[2000 Baku earthquake|November 2000 earthquake]], poor conservation as well as "dubious" restoration efforts.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace and Maiden Tower – UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/958 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302171720/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/958 |archive-date=2 March 2012 |access-date=22 May 2009 |publisher=Whc.unesco.org}}</ref> In 2009 the Inner City was removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Centre |first=UNESCO World Heritage |title=Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace and Maiden Tower |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/958 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922173754/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/958 |archive-date=22 September 2018 |access-date=22 September 2018 |website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |language=en}}</ref>
