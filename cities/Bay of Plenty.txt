The '''Bay of Plenty''' ({{lang-mi|Te Moana-a-Toitehuatahi}}) is a large [[bight (geography)|bight]] along the northern coast of [[New Zealand]]'s [[North Island]]. It stretches {{Convert|260|km}} from the [[Coromandel Peninsula]] in the west to [[Cape Runaway]] in the east. Called ''Te Moana-a-Toitehuatahi'' (the Ocean of Toitehuatahi) in the [[Māori language]] after [[Toi-te-huatahi]], an early ancestor, the name 'Bay of Plenty' was bestowed by [[James Cook]] in 1769 when he noticed the abundant food supplies at several [[Māori people|Māori]] villages there, in stark contrast to observations he had made earlier in [[Poverty Bay]].

== Geography ==
[[File:White Island n.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Whakaari / White Island]] and [[Te Paepae o Aotea]]]]The bay is defined by {{Convert|259|km}} of open coastline used for economic, recreational and cultural purposes. The coastline from [[Waihi Beach]] in the west to [[Opape]] is defined as sandy coast, while the coast from Opape to Cape Runaway is rocky shore.<ref name=EBOP-coast>{{cite web | title = Our Coast | publisher = Environment Bay of Plenty | url = http://www.ebop.govt.nz/Coast/Our-Coast.asp | access-date = 2008-03-03 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080116083836/http://www.ebop.govt.nz/Coast/Our-Coast.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2008-01-16}}</ref> Sizeable harbours are located at Tauranga, Whakatāne and Ohiwa. Major estuaries include [[Maketu]], Little Waihi, Whakatāne, Waiotahe and [[Waioeka River|Waioeka]]/[[Ōtara River|Ōtara]]. Eight major rivers empty into the bay from inland catchments, including the [[Wairoa River (Bay of Plenty)|Wairoa]], [[Kaituna River|Kaituna]], [[Tarawera River|Tarawera]], [[Rangitaiki River|Rangitaiki]], [[Whakatane River|Whakatane]], [[Waioeka River|Waioeka]], [[Motu River|Motu]] and [[Raukokore River|Raukokore]] rivers.<ref name=EBOP-geo>{{cite web | title = Our Region | publisher = Environment Bay of Plenty | url = http://www.ebop.govt.nz/Our-Region.asp | accessdate = 2008-03-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080218023016/http://www.ebop.govt.nz/Our-Region.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-18}}</ref>

The bay contains numerous islands, notably the active [[andesite]] [[stratovolcano]] [[Whakaari / White Island]]. Whakaari is New Zealand's most active [[volcanic cone|cone volcano]], and has been built up by continuous volcanic activity over the past 150,000 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://info.geonet.org.nz/display/volc/White+Island|title=White Island|publisher=[[GeoNet (New Zealand)|GeoNet]]|access-date=30 December 2012}}</ref> The nearest mainland towns are [[Whakatāne]] and [[Tauranga]]. The island has been in a nearly continuous stage of releasing [[volcanic gas]] at least since it was sighted by [[James Cook]] in 1769. Whakaari erupted continually from December 1975 until September 2000, marking the world's longest historic eruption episode, according to [[GeoNet (New Zealand)|GeoNet]], as well as in 2012, 2016, and 2019. The latter of these resulted in 22 deaths and 25 serious injuries, primarily of tourists from a nearby cruise ship who were exploring the island at the time.

Whakaari / White Island is roughly circular, about {{Convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter, and rises to a height of {{Convert|321|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level. It covers an area of approximately {{Cvt|325|ha|}}.<ref name="readersnatural">{{Cite book|title=Natural Wonders of the World|publisher=Reader's Digest Association, Inc|year=1980|isbn=978-0-89577-087-5|editor-last=Scheffel|editor-first=Richard L.|location=United States of America|pages=412|editor-last2=Wernet|editor-first2=Susan J.}}</ref> The exposed island is only the peak of a much larger [[submarine volcano]], which rises up to {{Convert|1600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the nearby seafloor. Sulphur was mined on the island until the 1930s. Ten miners were killed in 1914 when part of the crater wall collapsed.

=== Climate ===

The Bay of Plenty has a [[Temperate climate|temperate]], [[Oceanic climate|maritime]] climate,<ref name=TA-climate>{{cite web |author1=Mullan, Brett |author2=Tait, Andrew |author3=Thompson, Craig | title = Regional Climate | publisher = [[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] | url = http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/ClimateAndAtmosphere/Climate/2/en | date = 2007-09-21 | access-date = 2008-03-07| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080411104914/http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/ClimateAndAtmosphere/Climate/2/en| archive-date= 11 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> with warm, humid summers and mild winters.

== History ==
According to local [[Māori mythology|Māori traditions]], the Bay of Plenty was the landing point of several [[Māori migration canoes|migration canoes]] that brought Māori settlers to New Zealand. These include the ''[[Mātaatua]]'', ''[[Nukutere]]'', ''[[Tākitimu]]'', ''[[Arawa (canoe)|Arawa]]'' and ''[[Tainui (canoe)|Tainui]]'' canoes. Many of the descendent [[iwi]] maintain their traditional homelands (''[[rohe]]'') in the region, including [[Te Whānau-ā-Apanui]], [[Te Whakatōhea]], [[Ngāitai|Ngāi Tai]], [[Ngāi Tūhoe]], [[Ngāti Awa]], [[Ngāti Tūwharetoa]] ki Kawerau, [[Te Arawa]], [[Ngaiterangi|Ngāi Te Rangi]], [[Ngāti Ranginui]] and [[Ngāti Pūkenga]].<ref name=TeAra>{{cite encyclopedia |last= McKinnon |first= Malcolm |title=Bay of Plenty region |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |url= https://teara.govt.nz/en/bay-of-plenty-region |date=1 August 2016 |access-date=2 September 2024}}</ref> Māori named the bay ''Te Moana-a-Toitehuatahi'' (the Ocean of Toitehuatahi),<ref name=Gazetteer>{{Cite web |title=Te Moana-a-Toitehuatahi |url=https://gazetteer.linz.govt.nz/place/61439 |website=New Zealand Gazetteer |publisher=Land Information New Zealand |access-date=2 September 2024}}</ref> or ''Te Moana-a-Toi'' for short, after [[Toi-te-huatahi]], an early ancestor of the ''Mātaatua'' tribes.<ref name=TeAra/> Early Māori settlement also gave rise to many of the town and city names used today.

The first recorded European contact came when [[James Cook]] sailed through the Bay of Plenty in 1769. Cook noted the abundance of food supplies, in comparison to [[Poverty Bay]] further back along the eastern coast of the North Island. Further reports of European contact are scarce prior to the arrival of missionary [[Samuel Marsden]] to the Tauranga area in 1814. Bay whaling stations operated in the bay during the 19th century.<ref>Don Grady (1986), ''Sealers & whalers in New Zealand waters'', Auckland, Reed Methuen, p. 150. {{ISBN|0-474-00050-8}}</ref>

During the 1820s and 1830s, northern iwi including [[Ngā Puhi]] invaded the Bay of Plenty during their campaign throughout the North Island, fighting local Māori tribes in what became known as the [[Musket Wars]]. However, the 1830s and 1840s saw increased contact between Bay of Plenty Māori and Europeans through trade,<ref>{{cite web | title = Our History | publisher = Tourism Bay of Plenty | url = http://www.bayofplentynz.com/Tourism_Bay_Of_Plenty/OUR_HISTORY_IDL=3_IDT=1378_ID=7947_.html | access-date = 2008-02-25 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120207012330/http://www.bayofplentynz.com/Tourism_Bay_Of_Plenty/OUR_HISTORY_IDL=3_IDT=1378_ID=7947_.html | archive-date = 7 February 2012 | url-status = dead}}</ref> although few Europeans settled in the region.<ref name="boph">{{cite web |url=http://www.tourism.net.nz/new-zealand/about-new-zealand/regions/bay-of-plenty/history.html |title=Bay of Plenty History |work=New Zealand Tourism Guide |access-date=10 October 2011 }}</ref> Missionary activity in the region also increased during this time.<ref name=TeAra/> In 1853, New Zealand was subdivided into [[Provinces of New Zealand|provinces]], with the Bay of Plenty incorporated into [[Auckland Province]].

Conflict returned to the Bay of Plenty during the 1860s with the [[New Zealand Wars]]. Initially this stemmed from Tauranga iwi supporting the Waikato iwi in their conflict with the government. In retaliation, British Crown and government-allied Māori forces attacked the Tauranga iwi, including at the famous Battle of [[Gate Pā]] in 1864. Further conflict with the government arose in 1865 when German missionary [[Carl Völkner]] and interpreter James Fulloon were killed by local Māori at [[Ōpōtiki]] and Whakatāne, respectively. The ensuing conflict resulted in the [[New Zealand land confiscations|confiscation of considerable land]] from several Bay of Plenty iwi by the government.<ref name=TeAra/>

[[File:Pukehina Beach, Bay of Plenty, New Zealand.jpg|thumb|left|Pukehina Beach]]Confiscation of Māori land deprived local iwi of economic resources (among other things), and also provided land for expanding European settlement. The government established fortified positions, including at Tauranga, Whakatāne and Ōpōtiki. European settlers arrived throughout the latter half of the 19th century, establishing settlements in [[Katikati]], [[Te Puke]] and the Rangitaiki area. In 1876, settlements were incorporated into [[Counties of New Zealand|counties]] following the nationwide dissolution of the provincial system. Initial settlements in the region struggled: the climate was ill-suited to sheep farming and the geography was inaccessible, further hindered by a lack of infrastructure. By the end of the century the population had started to dwindle. But after experimenting with different crops, settlers found success with dairy production. Dairy factories sprang up across the Bay of Plenty in the 1900s, with butter and cheese feeding economic prosperity throughout the early 20th century; local Māori continued to live on the fringe of this prosperity. Timber also became a major export in the 1950s, as kiwifruit did later.<ref name=TeAra/>

On 5 October 2011, the [[MV Rena]] ran aground on the [[Astrolabe Reef]] in the bay causing a [[2011 Tauranga oil spill|large oil spill]],<ref name="MNZ">{{cite web |url=http://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/news/media-releases-2011/20111005c.asp |title=Tauranga incident response update |publisher=Maritime New Zealand |date=5 October 2011 |access-date=2011-10-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018232601/http://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/news/media-releases-2011/20111005c.asp |archive-date=18 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://costamare.irwebpage.com/pr100711.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120720010921/http://costamare.irwebpage.com/pr100711.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=20 July 2012 |title=M/V Rena Information |publisher=Costamare Inc |date=7 October 2011 |access-date=2011-10-12 }}</ref> described as New Zealand's worst ever environmental disaster.<ref name=stuff3>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10758195 |title=Worst ever environmental disaster |work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=11 October 2011 |access-date=2011-10-11}}</ref>

[[2019 Whakaari/White Island eruption|A volcanic eruption]] occurred on Whakaari / White Island at 14:11 on 9 December 2019, which resulted in twenty fatalities and twenty-seven injuries, most suffering severe burns. Forty-seven people were reportedly on the island when it erupted. A second eruption closely followed the first.
