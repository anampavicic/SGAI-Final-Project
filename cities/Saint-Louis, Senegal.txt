'''Saint-Louis''' or '''Saint Louis''' ({{langx|wo|Ndar}}), is the capital of [[Senegal]]'s [[Saint-Louis Region]]. Located in the northwest of Senegal, near the mouth of the [[Senegal River]], and {{convert|320|km|mi}} north of Senegal's capital city [[Dakar]]. It had a population of 254,171 in 2023.<ref name="pop"/> Saint-Louis was the capital of the French colony of Senegal from 1673 until 1902 and [[French West Africa]] from 1895 until 1902, when the capital was moved to Dakar. From 1920 to 1957, it also served as the capital of the neighboring colony of [[Mauritania]].

The town was an important economic center during the period of [[French West Africa]], but it is less important now. Nonetheless, it still has important industries, including tourism, a commercial center, sugar production, and fishing. The tourism industry is in part due to the city being listed as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 2000.<ref name=":1" /> However, the city is also [[Climate change vulnerability|vulnerable to climate change]]—where [[sea level rise]] is expected to threaten the city center and potential damage historical parts of the city; according to a Senegalese government study, up to 80% of the city could be at risk of flooding by 2080.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news |date=2024-06-24 |title=The “Venice of Africa” is sinking into the sea |url=https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/06/24/the-venice-of-africa-is-sinking-into-the-sea |access-date=2024-08-10 |work=The Economist |issn=0013-0613}}</ref> Moreover, other issues such as [[Overfishing in West Africa|overfishing]] are causing ripple effects in the local economy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}

{{anchor|Toponomy|Etymology|Name}}

==Etymology==
Saint Louis ({{langx|fr|Saint-Louis}}) is named after [[Louis IX of France|Louis{{nbsp}}IX]], a [[canonization|canonized]] 13th-century [[kings of France|king]] of [[Kingdom of France|France]].<ref name=dofokow/> Obliquely, the name also honored [[Louis XIV of France|Louis{{nbsp}}XIV]], the reigning king of France at the time of the island's settlement in 1659.<ref name=dofokow/> It was originally known as Saint Louis of the Fort (''{{lang|fr|St-Louis-du-Fort}}'') after its stronghold and to distinguish it from [[Saint Louis (disambiguation)|other places of the same name]]. The [[Langue de Barbarie]] takes its name from the French for "Barbary Tongue", after an old name for the land of the [[Berbers]].

The local name Ndar or N'dar is [[Wolof language|Wolof]] for a kind of [[island]]<ref name=dofokow/> and has been borne by the island since before the French settlement. Ndar Tout or Toute is a [[Frenchification|Gallicized]] form of a Wolof name meaning "Little" or "Lesser Saint Louis".<ref>{{citation |contribution=Coins d'Histoire |contribution-url=https://www.ndarinfo.com/NdaRagne/Coins-d-Histoire-Ndar-Toute-signifie-en-wolof-le-petit-Saint-Louis_a19.html |url=https://www.ndarinfo.com/NdaRagne |title=Ndar Ragne! }}.</ref> The neighborhood of Guet Ndar takes its name from a [[Wolof language|Wolof]] word for "pasture".<ref name=diop>{{citation |last=Diop |first=Cheikh |contribution=Restructuring in the Neighborhood of Guet Ndar-Senegal |title=International Journal of Engineering Works |publisher=Kambohwell |volume=4 |pages=108–113 |date=June 2017 |issue=6 }}.</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Saintlouis ile pecheur.jpg|thumb|[[Langue de Barbarie]]]]
Saint-Louis is situated in northern [[Senegal]], on the [[Mauritania–Senegal border|border]] with [[Mauritania]], although the nearest border crossing is at [[Rosso]], {{convert|100|km|sp=us|abbr=on}} up the Senegal River.

The heart of the old colonial city is located on a narrow island a little more than {{convert|2|km|sp=us|abbr=on}} long but only about {{convert|400|m|sp=us|abbr=on}} wide. The island lies in the [[Senegal River]]. It is {{convert|25|km|sp=us|abbr=on}} north of its mouth, but is only separated from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to its west by the [[Langue de Barbarie]], a {{convert|300|m|sp=us|abbr=on|adj=on}} wide [[sand spit]]. The Langue de Barbarie is the location of the seaside neighborhoods Ndar Toute and Guet Ndar. On the mainland, the east bank of the river is the site of Sor, an older settlement now considered a suburb of Saint-Louis. It is nearly surrounded by [[Salt marsh|tidal marshes]].

Three characteristics give Saint-Louis its distinctive geographic appearance: the [[Sahel]], the marshes and the Langue de Barbarie.

Part of the Sahel, a transitional desertic band that separates "[...] the dunes of the Sahara from the baobabs of the savanna",<ref name="SL">http://www.sunugal.com/en/st-louis.html{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref> Saint-Louis' landscape is characterized by occasional [[acacia]]s and is disturbed by sand storms during the dry season.

The marshes are flood basins that form during the rainy season when the river overflows into the countryside, creating ponds and stretches of mangroves that attract birds like [[flamingos]] and [[pelicans]].

The [[Langue de Barbarie]], over a stretch of {{convert|25|km|sp=us|abbr=on}}, separates the lower [[Senegal River]] from the Atlantic Ocean. Its vegetation mainly consists of [[Filao tree]]s, propagated to prevent soil erosion in sandy and salty soils.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/pdf/BTC_Booklet.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100725220445/http://www.unep.org/pdf/BTC_Booklet.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-07-25 |title=PLANT FOR THE PLANET: THE BILLION TREE CAMPAIGN |publisher=Unep.org }}</ref>

===Natural sites===
Among Saint-Louis' numerous natural sites are the National Park of the Langue de Barbarie, the [[Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary|National Park of the Birds of Djoudj]], the Fauna Reserve of Gueumbeul, beaches like that of the [[Langue de Barbarie]], the colonial waterworks at Makhana, the palace of {{Interlanguage link|Baron Roger|fr|3=Jacques-François Roger}} at [[Richard-Toll]], the [[Diama Dam]], and various hunting lodges on the south side of the Senegal River.

This park, which is 20 square kilometres large, occupies the southern point of the Langue de Barbarie, the estuary of the Senegal river and part of the continent. It hosts thousands of water birds like cormorants, brushes, pink flamingos, pelicans, herons and ducks each year.

The world's third largest ornithological park, it is located 60&nbsp;kilometers north of Saint-Louis. This park occupies over 120&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and includes part of the river, and many lakes, basins, and marshes. About 3&nbsp;million migrating birds of 400 species visit it each year.

Located at a dozen kilometers south of the city of Saint-Louis, this reserve has an area of 7 square kilometres and shelters birds and endangered species such as the [[Dama Gazelle|dama gazelle]], the [[Patas monkey]] and the [[African spurred tortoise]].<ref name="Parks">{{cite web|url=http://www.au-senegal.com/decouvrir_en/parc_barbarie.htm |title=Découvrir le Sénégal, pays de la teranga |publisher=Au Senegal |access-date=2013-09-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221050328/http://www.au-senegal.com/decouvrir_en/parc_barbarie.htm |archive-date=2007-12-21 }}</ref>

===Climate===
Saint-Louis has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh''). It only has two seasons, the rainy season from June to October, characterized by heat, humidity and storms, and the dry season from November to May, characterized by cool ocean breeze and dust from the [[Harmattan]] winds.<ref name="SL" /> A 2011 documentary described Saint-Louis as the African city most threatened by [[sea level rise|rising sea levels]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.open.edu/openlearn/body-mind/earth-reporters-my-city-and-your-city |title=Earth Reporters: My City and Your City - OpenLearn - Open University |publisher=Open.edu |access-date=2013-01-01 |archive-date=6 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806151400/https://www.open.edu/openlearn/body-mind/earth-reporters-my-city-and-your-city |url-status=dead }}</ref> Flooding is becoming worse, and by 2080 80% of the city will face flood risks.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/06/24/the-venice-of-africa-is-sinking-into-the-sea |title=The "Venice of Africa" is sinking into the sea |work=The Economist |date=24 June 2024 |access-date=25 June 2024}}</ref>

===Founding===
[[File:Hommes femmes et scènes du Sénégal-Jacques Grasset de Saint Sauveur mg 8495.jpg|thumb|upright|''Negresse of quality from the Island of Saint Louis in Senegal, accompanied by her slave'', Illustration from ''Costumes civils de tous les peuples connus'', Paris, 1788, by {{Interlanguage link|Jacques Grasset de Saint-Sauveur|fr}}.]]
A Wolof settlement at what is now known as Guet Ndar dates from around 1450 and was a meeting and departure point for [[Islam in Senegal|Muslim]] [[hajj|pilgrims]] traveling to [[Mecca]] in [[Arabia]].<ref name=diop/> [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], and [[British Empire|English]] traders visited the area over the next two centuries but the first nearby colonial fortification was erected by the [[Kingdom of France|French]] in 1638 on [[Bocos Island]], about {{convert|25|km|sp=us|abbr=on}} away.<ref name=dofokow>{{citation |contribution=Saint Louis and Segou (Sikoro): Broad Historical Sketches |contribution-url=http://dofokow.blogspot.com/2012/02/saint-louis-and-segou-sikoro-broad.html |date=12 February 2012 |url=http://dofokow.blogspot.com |title=Dofo Kow: History Matters }}.</ref>

Repeated [[flood]]ing prompted the removal of the fort to the island known to locals as Ndar in 1659.<ref name=dofokow/> The island was uninhabited at the time,<ref>Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/Saint-Louis-Senegal Saint-Louis], britannica.com, USA, accessed on June 23, 2019</ref> supposedly because the local people believed it to be haunted by spirits.<ref name=dofokow/> The Diagne of Sor, the local leader, permitted French settlement on the island for annual payments of "three pieces of [[dyeing|blue cloth]], a measure of [[dyeing|scarlet cloth]], seven long [[iron]] bars, and 10 [[pint]]s of [[eau de vie]]."<ref name=dofokow/>
[[File:Saint-LouisMer.jpg|thumb|left|French view of the fort at Saint-Louis island, from "L'Afrique ou histoire, moeurs, usages et coutumes des Africains", by René Claude Geoffroy de Villeneuve, 1814.]]

===Colonial capital===
[[File:Colonial Saint Louis.jpg|thumb|Colonial Saint Louis c. 1900. Europeans and Africans on the Rue Lebon.]]
The fortification permitted its factory to command foreign trade along the [[Senegal River]]. Slaves, gold, hides, beeswax, ambergris and, later, gum arabic were exported. During the [[Seven Years' War]], British forces [[Capture of Senegal|captured Senegal]] in 1758. In February 1779, French forces recaptured Saint-Louis. In the late 18th century, Saint-Louis had about 5,000 inhabitants, not counting an indeterminate number of slaves in transit.

Between 1659 and 1779, nine chartered companies succeeded one another in administering Saint-Louis. As in [[Gorée]], a Franco-African Creole, or Métis, merchant community characterized by the famous "[[signare]]s", or bourgeois women entrepreneurs, grew up in Saint-Louis during the 17th and 18th centuries. The Métis were important to the economic, social, cultural and political life of the city. They created a distinctive urban culture characterized by public displays of elegance, refined entertainment and popular festivities. They controlled most of the up-country river trade and they financed the principal Catholic institutions. A Métis mayor was first designated by the Governor in 1778. Civic franchise was further consolidated in 1872, when Saint-Louis became a French "commune".

After the decline of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] after 1790, the trade in [[gum arabic]] replaced it as the major economic engine of Saint Louis. Trade was increasingly concentrated in the lower river valley and the desert-side ''escales'', rather than further upriver in [[Gajaaga]] as it had been previously. The city was again captured by the British during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and returned to France in 1817. Facing a near-total dependence on gum, the French authorities tried to promote plantation agriculture in [[Waalo]] from 1819 to 1830, but this failed. At the same time, Saint Louis grew massively during this period in both population in commercial activity.<ref name = Webb>{{cite book |last1=Webb |first1=James |title=Desert frontier : ecological and economic change along the Western Sahel, 1600-1850 |date=1995 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |location=Madison |isbn=0299143309 |page=29 |url=https://archive.org/details/desertfrontierec0000webb/page/28/mode/2up |access-date=25 December 2023}}</ref>{{rp|115–6}}

Throughout the 19th century, the French periodically warred with the [[Emirate of Trarza]] and other Hassani tribal states, which disrupted the flow of gum. Nevertheless, with the removal of trade restrictions in 1848 and in 1853, exports soared. When war again broke out in 1854, the Arab Emirs forbade the [[Berbers|Berber]] ''zwaya'' merchants from selling to the French, but this had little effect.<ref name = Webb/>{{rp|130}} In the 1855 [[Battle of Leybar Bridge]] a small force of French Marines defended the town from a large Trarza force. With the French victory in 1858, they were able to set the terms of trade on the river.<ref name = Webb/>{{rp|130}}

[[Louis Faidherbe]], who became the Governor of the Colony of Senegal in 1854, contributed greatly to the development and modernization of Saint Louis. His large-scale projects included the building of bridges, provisioning of fresh drinking water, and the construction of an overland telegraph line to [[Dakar]].<ref name="SLH">{{cite web|url=http://www.saintlouisdusenegal.com/english/histoire20901.htm|title=Saint-Louis du Sénégal ! Bonnes adresses, petites annonces et infos pratiques. St-Louis Senegal|author=CYBER PROD|publisher=saintlouisdusenegal.com|access-date=2014-02-11}}</ref> Saint-Louis became capital of the federation of French West African colonies in 1895, but relinquished this role to Dakar in 1902.

[[File:Saintlouis pont Faidherbe.jpg|thumb|[[Faidherbe Bridge]], the symbol of the city.]]
Saint-Louis's fortunes began to wane as those of Dakar waxed. Access to its port became increasingly awkward in the age of the steamship and the completion of the [[Dakar–Saint-Louis railway|Dakar-Saint Louis railroad]] in 1885 meant that up-country trade effectively circumvented its port. Large French firms, many from the city of [[Bordeaux]], took over the new commercial networks of the interior, marginalizing the Métis traders in the process. Saint-Louis nonetheless maintained its status as capital of the Colony of Senegal even after Dakar assumed the role of capital of the French West Africa federation. The colonial institutions set up in the city in the 19th century, such as the Muslim Tribunal and the School for Chiefs' Sons, were to play important roles in the history of French Africa. Though relatively small in size (population of 10,000 in 1826; 23,000 in 1914, and 39,000 in 1955) Saint-Louis dominated Senegalese politics throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, not least because of its numerous political parties and associations and its independent newspapers.{{citation needed|date=January 2024}}

===Independence===
Following independence, when Dakar became sole capital of the country, Saint-Louis slipped into a state of lethargy. As its French population and military departed, many of the town's shops, offices and businesses closed.<ref name="SLS">{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/956 |title=Island of Saint-Louis - UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |access-date=2013-09-29}}</ref> The loss of jobs, human potential, and investment caused its economic decline. The loss of its past status meant less recognition and lack of interest from the colony's officials and, after Senegal's independence, from the Senegalese government. When its most famous political son, the French-educated lawyer [[Lamine Guèye (politician)|Lamine Guèye]], died in 1968, the city lost its strongest proponent.

Since 1993, the city has hosted the [[Saint Louis Jazz Festival]], a major tourist draw.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Holloway |first1=Beetle |title=Visit Africa's Largest Jazz Festival in Saint-Louis, Senegal |url=https://theculturetrip.com/africa/senegal/articles/visit-africas-largest-jazz-festival-in-saint-louis-senegal |website=Culture Trip |access-date=1 January 2024}}</ref>

==Environmental issues==
{{Further|Environmental issues in Senegal|Climate change in Senegal}}
Between 2016 and 2017, Saint-Louis experienced a large decline in the catch of fish brought in, causing ripple effects on nutrition and food supply in the country, where 75% of animal protein comes from fish.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Edwards|first=Meaghan Beatley and Sam|date=2018-05-31|title=Overfished: In Senegal, empty nets lead to hunger and violence|url=https://gpinvestigations.pri.org/overfished-in-senegal-empty-nets-lead-to-hunger-and-violence-e3b5d0c9a686|access-date=2020-04-28|website=Public Radio International|language=en}}</ref> Fisherman from the community spend twice as much time for catching smaller hauls, and are now competing with foreign fishing vessels.<ref name="undp.org">{{Cite web|title=Saint-Louis, Senegal: the challenge of sustainability|url=https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/blog/2017/6/9/Saint-Louis-Senegal-the-challenge-of-sustainability.html|access-date=2020-12-18|website=UNDP|language=en}}</ref>

Rising sea levels, as well as water levels flowing out of the [[Senegal River]] now threaten the low-lying islands which make up the city. An ill-fated 2003 canal project exacerbated flooding issues, leading to submerged neighborhoods.<ref name=":2" /> In June 2008, Alioune Badiane of the [[United Nations]]' [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme|UN-Habitat]] agency designated Saint-Louis as "the city most threatened by rising sea levels in the whole of Africa", citing [[climate change]] and a failed 2004 river and tidal canal project as the cause.<ref>{{cite web|date=2008-06-13|title=Africa - Senegal city is 'most threatened'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7452352.stm|access-date=2013-09-29|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> According to a Senegalese government study, up to 80% of the city could be at risk of flooding by 2080.<ref name=":2" /> As of 2020, the coast of the community has eroded by 1–2 meters a year.<ref name="undp.org"/>

==Economy==
Saint Louis has economically declined since the transfer of the capital to Dakar, but has remained an important tourist and trading center.<ref name="Ency">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/html/S/SaintLou.asp |title=Saint Louis Facts, information, pictures - Encyclopedia.com articles about Saint Louis |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |access-date=2013-09-29}}</ref> The city's economy, though not entirely recovered, is gradually reviving.

The city was listed as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 2000 and cultural tourism has become an engine of growth. As a result, a process of gentrification has set in, with many historic buildings on the island being turned into restaurants and hotels.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Saint-Louis du Sénégal. Ville aux mille Visages|last=Brigaud Félix, Vast Jean|publisher=ed. Clairafrique|year=1987|location=Dakar|pages=187 p}}</ref>

Beyond tourism, Saint-Louis is also a commercial and an industrial centre for sugar production. Its other economic activities are fishing, irrigated alluvial agriculture, pastoral farming, trading and exportation of peanut skins. It is important to note that each of these economic activities is assured by a particular ethnic group. The Wolofs and Lebous who are the main inhabitants of Saint-Louis are mostly fishermen that live in fishing communities like Guet-Ndar on the Langue de Barbarie. The [[Fula people|Fulas]]<ref>In {{langx|fr|Peul}} or {{lang|fr|Peulh}}; in {{langx|ff|Fulɓe}}.</ref> live in the inland and practice pastoral farming. The Maures who are migrants from Mauritania (Saint-Louis is less than {{convert|6|mi|km|0|order=flip|abbr=off|disp=or}} south of the border with Mauritania) are mostly merchants, traders and shopkeepers found everywhere in Saint Louis.<ref name="Pop">{{cite web|url=http://www.au-senegal.com/decouvrir_en/pop.htm |title=Découvrir le Sénégal, pays de la teranga |publisher=Au Senegal |access-date=2013-09-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221050333/http://www.au-senegal.com/decouvrir_en/pop.htm |archive-date=2007-12-21 }}</ref>

==Culture==
[[File:Saint-Louis-du-Sénégal.JPG|thumb|[[Pirogue]]s, many painted with names of Sufi leaders, jam the Saint-Louis wharf. Today they are used for fishing, transport, and tourism.]]
Culture constitutes an important part of Saint-Louis' economy. The city preserves much of its 19th-century morphology, reminiscent of other cities of the "Creole Atlantic": [[Bahia]], [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], [[Havana]] and [[New Orleans]]. Thanks to its distinctive appearance, numerous sites of attraction and its international music festivals and cultural exhibitions, Saint-Louis attracts many tourists each year.

Saint-Louis remains the most characteristically French colonial destination in West Africa along with [[Gorée]] Island.

===Events and festivals===
[[File:SaintLouisGirls.jpg|thumb|left|Girls gather on a street in Saint-Louis, 2007.]]
Saint Louis is famous for its urban culture. The heritage of the signares lives on in the city's many festivals and its cultivated sense of public display, and it is helping Saint-Louis emerge from decades of neglect. "Fanals", which are night-time processions of giant paper lanterns, take place at Christmas time.

The Saint-Louis Jazz Festival is the most important jazz festival in Africa. Jazz first became popular in the 1930s when records produced in [[Cuba]] were aired on the radio. After [[World War II]], visiting [[G.I. (military)|U.S. GIs]] popularized jazz bands and by the 1950s local groups had adopted a "Cuban" sound. Another music festival, 1, 2, 3 musiques, exhibits various genres of music.

The Festival Métissons, held for the first time in 2010, is a grassroots music festival organized by local communities and small businesses. Every edition sports international, national and local musical talent.

The annual reggata, or pirogue race organized by teams of fishermen from Guet-Ndar, takes place on the "little branch" of the river, between Ndar Island and the Langue de Barbarie.

The Magal of the Niari Rakas, a yearly commemoration of [[Cheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacké]]'s (the founder of Mouridism) two prayers in the Governor's Palace in 1895, is the city's largest religious gathering.<ref name="SLH"/>

===UNESCO World Heritage Site===
Saint-Louis' characteristic colonial architecture along with its regular town plan, its location on an island at the mouth of the Senegal River and the system of quays, gives Saint-Louis the distinctive appearance and identity that have raised the island to the rank of world heritage since 2000. The Island of Saint-Louis is inscribed on the World Heritage list on the basis of criteria II and IV:

'''Criterion II''' The historic town of Saint-Louis exhibits an important exchange of values and influences on the development of education and culture, architecture, craftsmanship, and services in a large part of West Africa.

'''Criterion IV''' The Island of Saint-Louis, a former capital of West Africa, is an outstanding example of a colonial city, characterized by its particular natural setting, and it illustrates the development of colonial government in this region.<ref name="SLS" />

===Architecture===
Among interesting and attractive monuments and edifices are the Governor's Palace, the ''Gouvernance'' where are located the town's administrative offices, the Parc Faidherbe named for the French governor at the centre of town [[Louis Faidherbe]], colonial-era hotels, the historic airport at [[Dakar-Bango]] on the mainland, the [[Faidherbe Bridge]] that connects the island to the Langue de Barbarie and the Gaol and Servatius bridges that connect the island to the continent.

====Places of worship====
[[File:Saintlouis mosquée2.jpg|thumb|Grande Mosquée]]

Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann, ‘‘Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices’’, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2010, p. 2573-2575</ref>  There are also [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples: [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint-Louis du Sénégal]] ([[Catholic Church]]), [[Assemblies of God]], [[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]].

==Education==
[[File:LaTourUGBVueSudOuest.jpg|thumb|The main tower at [[Gaston Berger University]], 2007.]]

With a large influence over education in colonial times, Saint Louis is now a center of educational excellence. It is home to the [[Gaston Berger University]] and The Military Academy Charles Ntchorere.

Gaston Berger University, created in 1990, offers studies organized in a number of general education and research faculties.<ref name="Univ">{{cite web |url=http://www.ugb.sn/accueil.htm |title=Université Gaston Berger |access-date=2023-06-06 |website=www.ugb.sn |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423164551/http://www.ugb.sn/accueil.htm |archive-date=April 23, 2006}}</ref>
