'''Muthanna Governorate''' ({{langx|ar|المثنى}} ''Al Muthannā'') or '''Al Muthanna Province''', is a [[Governorates of Iraq|province]] in [[Iraq]], named after the 7th-century Arab general [[al-Muthanna ibn Haritha]]. It is in the south of the country, bordering [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait]]. The provincial capital is the city of [[Samawah]]. It has the highest poverty rate in Iraq, with a rate of 52%.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Poverty rate in Nineveh province nearly doubled |url=https://kirkuknow.com/en/news/61545 |access-date=2024-01-22 |website=Kirkuknow |language=en}}</ref>

==History==
Before 1976 it was part of the [[Diwaniya Province]], which included present-day [[Najaf Governorate]] and [[al-Qādisiyyah Governorate]].

[[Samawah]] is very close to the ancient [[Sumer]]ian-[[Babylonia]]n city of [[Uruk]] ([[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]: ''Erech''), which is possibly the source of the name [[Iraq]]. After the decline of [[Babylon]] following the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] founding of [[Seleucia]], Uruk became the largest city in southern Babylonia, and its name (''Erech'') came to replace ''Babili'' (Babylonia), as the city long outlived the former capital, surviving into the 7th century AD.

In February 1991 it was the location of one of the largest tank battles in history during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], the [[Battle of Norfolk]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/6-massive-tank-battles-from-us-history|title=These were the 6 most massive tank battles in US history|date=16 April 2021}}</ref>
