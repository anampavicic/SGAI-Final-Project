'''Jeju Province''' ({{korean|rr=Jeju-do|제주도}}; {{IPA|ko|tɕedʑudo|IPA}}), officially '''Jeju Special Self-Governing Province''' ([[Jeju language|Jeju]]: {{Lang-ko|제주특벨ᄌᆞ치도|label=none}}; {{korean|제주특별자치도}}),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.jeju.go.kr/|title=Jeju Special Self-Governing Province|access-date=25 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619165541/http://english.jeju.go.kr/|archive-date=19 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> is the southernmost [[Provinces of South Korea|province]] of [[South Korea]], consisting of eight inhabited and 55 uninhabited islands, including [[Marado|Mara Island]], [[Udo (island)|Udo Island]], the [[Chuja Islands|Chuja Archipelago]], and the country's largest island, [[Jeju Island]].<ref group="note">formerly transliterated as '''Cheju Island''' or '''Cheju Do''', the island was also previously known as '''Quelpart''' to Europeans and as '''Saishū''' during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation of Korea]].</ref> The province is located in the [[Korea Strait]], with the [[Korea|Korean Peninsula]] to the northwest, [[Japan]] to the east, and [[China]] to the west. The province has two cities: the capital [[Jeju City]], on the northern half of the island and [[Seogwipo]], on the southern half of the island. The island is home to the shield volcano [[Hallasan]], the highest point in South Korea. [[Jeju language|Jeju]] and [[Korean language|Korean]] are the official languages of the province, and the vast majority of residents are [[Multilingualism|bilingual]].

Jeju Island was first settled by humans 8,000 to 10,000 years ago and the [[Tamna|Tamna Kingdom]] is the earliest known civilization on the island. Beginning in the 5th century AD, the kingdom would become a [[tributary state]] of various Korean Kingdoms and briefly invaded by the [[Mongol Empire]], before being annexed into the [[Goryeo]] in 1105 and later [[Joseon]] in 1392. Joseon ruled the island brutally and multiple uprisings occurred. Jeju Island, with the rest of [[Korea|mainland Korea]], was [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910|annexed]] by the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1910. Following [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] in [[World War II]] in 1945, the islands became part of [[South Jeolla Province]] in the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]], before becoming a separate province on August 1, 1946. On July 1, 2006, the islands were designated a Special Self-Governing Province; it is now one of three special self-governing provinces, the others being [[Gangwon Province, South Korea|Gangwon State]] and [[North Jeolla Province|Jeonbuk State]].

===Early history===
[[File:탐라기년.jpg|thumb|Tamna Ginyun, a history book written over 934 years from the [[Goryeo]] period to the [[Joseon]] period]]
{{See also|Tamna#Historical and archaeological records}}
The earliest known [[polity]] on the island was the kingdom of [[Tamna]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jejuweekly.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=5452|title=The Queen of Tamna: Was Jeju previously ruled by a mythical warrior queen? - JEJU WEEKLY|website=Jejuweekly.com|access-date=2023-03-05|archive-date=2018-11-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181128164618/http://www.jejuweekly.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=5452|url-status=dead}}</ref>

According to the legend, three demigods emerged from [[Samseong mythology|Samseong]], which is said to have been on the northern slopes of [[Halla Mountain|Mt. Halla]] and became the progenitors of the Jeju people, who founded the Kingdom of [[Tamna]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|date=28 August 2020|title=History Of Jeju-Island|url=https://www.yatra.com/international-tourism/Jeju-island/history|access-date=16 September 2020|archive-date=3 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210203081224/https://www.yatra.com/international-tourism/Jeju-island/history|url-status=live}}</ref>

It has also been claimed that three brothers, including Ko-hu, who were the 15th descendants of Koulla, one of the progenitors of the Jeju people, were received by the court of [[Silla]], at which time{{when|date=October 2014}} the name Tamna was officially recognized, while the official government posts of Commander, Prince and Governor were conferred by the court upon the three. However, there is no concrete evidence of when the "Three Names" (Samseong-Ko, Yang and Pu) appeared nor the exact date of when Ko-hu and his brothers were received by Silla. The "Three Names" Founding Period may be assumed to have occurred during the Three Kingdoms ([[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]] and [[Silla]]) Period on the mainland of Korea.<ref name=":2" />

[[Taejo of Goryeo|Taejo]], founder of [[Goryeo]], attempted to establish the same relationship between Goryeo and Tamna as Tamna had had with Silla. Tamna refused to accept this position and the Goryeo court dispatched troops to force Tamna to submit. Ko ja-gyeon, chief of Tamna, submitted to Goryeo in 938 and sent his son, Prince Mallo, to Goryeo's court as a de facto hostage. In 1105, (King Sukjong's 10th year), the Goryeo court abolished the name Takna, which had been used up to this time and, from that year on, the island was known as "Tamna-gun" (district) and Goryeo officials were sent to handle the affairs of the island.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}

Tamna-country was changed to Tamna-county in 1153, during the reign of King Uijong and Choi Cheok-kyeong was posted as Tamna-Myeong or Chief of Tamna. During the reign of [[Gojong of Goryeo]], Tamna was renamed "Jeju", which means "province across the sea".<ref name="hilty">{{cite book |last=Hilty |first=Anne |year=2011 |title=Jeju Island: Reaching to the Core of Beauty |series=Korea Essentials |volume=5 |location=Republic of Korea |publisher=[[Korea Foundation]] |isbn=9788991913837}}</ref>{{rp|93}}

In 1271, General [[Kim T'ong-jŏng]] escaped with what remained of his [[Sambyeolcho]] force from Jindo and built the Hangpadu Fortress at Kwiil-chon from where they continued their fight against the combined Korean government-Mongolian army, but within two years, faced by an enemy army of over 10,000 troops, the Sambyeolcho was annihilated.

After Mongol invasions of Korea, the [[Mongol Empire]] established a base on Jeju Island with its ally, the Goryeo army in ([[Tamna prefectures]]) and converted part of the island to a grazing area for the Korean and Mongol cavalry stationed there.<ref>{{cite book|first=William E.|last= Henthorn|title=Korea: the Mongol invasions|publisher=E.J.

In the beginning of the 15th century, Jeju Island was subjected to the highly centralized rule of the [[Joseon]] dynasty. A travel ban was implemented for almost 200 years and many uprisings by Jeju Island residents were suppressed.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Yang|first1=Changyong|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvwvr2qt|title=Jejueo: The Language of Korea's Jeju Island|last2=Yang|first2=Sejung|last3=O'Grady|first3=William|date=2019-12-31|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-8140-5|pages=3|doi=10.2307/j.ctvwvr2qt.6|jstor=j.ctvwvr2qt|s2cid=241929091}}</ref> During the [[Joseon]] period (1392–1910), Jeju islanders were treated as foreigners and Jeju was considered as a place for horse breeding and exile for political prisoners.<ref name="hilty" />{{rp|95}} In the 17th century, [[Injo of Joseon]] issued an edict prohibiting islanders from travelling to the Korean mainland.<ref name="hilty" />{{rp|95}} Consequently, Jeju islanders staged several major uprisings, including the Kang Je Geom Rebellion (1862), Bang Seong Chil Rebellion (1898), and the Lee Jae Su Rebellion (1901).<ref name="hilty" />{{rp|95}}

====Jeju Uprising, 1948====
{{main|Jeju Uprising}}
[[File:Jeju Massacre.jpg|thumb|Suspected communist sympathizers awaiting execution in May 1948 after the [[Jeju uprising]]]]
On April 3, 1948, against a background of an ongoing ideological struggle for control of Korea and a variety of grievances held by islanders against the local authorities, many communist sympathizers on the island attacked police stations and government offices. The brutal and often indiscriminate suppression of the rebellion resulted in the deaths of thousands of civilians and insurgents, and the imprisonment of thousands more in internment camps. 14,000 to 30,000 people were killed in total during the 13 month uprising.<ref>{{citation |last=Wheeler |first=Wolcott |url=http://www.kimsoft.com/1997/43wh.htm |title=The 1948 Cheju-do Civil War | work =Korea WebWeekly |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991012020858/http://www.kimsoft.com/1997/43wh.htm |archive-date=1999-10-12 |access-date=2014-04-21 }}</ref>

From 3 April 1948 to May 1949, the South Korean government conducted an [[anticommunist]] campaign to suppress an [[Jeju uprising|attempted uprising]] on the island.<ref name="Hugh Deane 1999 54-58">{{cite book|author=Hugh Deane|title=The Korean War, 1945-1953|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32Vy2Fj4KFUC|year=1999|publisher=China Books&Periodicals, Inc|pages=54–58|isbn=9780141912240}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|title = Cheju-do Rebellion|last = Merrill|first = John|date = 1980|journal = The Journal of Korean Studies|volume = 2|doi = 10.1353/jks.1980.0004|pages = 139–197|s2cid = 143130387}}</ref> The main cause for the rebellion was the election scheduled for 10 May 1948, designed by the [[UNTCOK|United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea]] (UNTCOK) to create a new government for all of Korea.

==Administrative divisions==

===Historical===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2022}}
In 1273, the Mongolian [[Yuan dynasty]] established a military governor on the island, and for nearly a hundred years the island was effectively under the complete control of these governors.

During the [[Joseon]] period, all of the administrative rights and systems of Jeju island, which had maintained some independence until this time, were absorbed into the centralized form of government established by Joseon.

In 1402, the titles of Commander and Prince were abolished. In 1416, the island was divided into three major administrative districts: The area lying generally north of Mt. Halla was headed by a 'Moksa' or county magistrate, while the eastern area of Jeongui-county (today's Seongeup Folk village) and the southwestern area of Daejeong-county (today's Moseulpo, Daejeong-eup, and Mt. Sanbang) were each headed by a Hyeon-gam (also county magistrate).

In August 1864, both Jeongui and Daejeong hyeons were removed from the control of the 'moksa' north of the mountain in today's Jeju-si area and were renamed 'Gun" (county) and came under the direct control of the Gwanchalsa (governor) of Jeolla province. Because of strife between these 'Guns' and the Jeju 'moksa', the system was abolished in January 1880, and the two 'Guns' reverted again to 'hyeon'.

In 1895, Jeju-mok was redesigned as Jeju-Bu with a governor (Gwanchalsa) and Vice-governor (Chamsagwan) and a police agency was newly established, while in both Jeongui and Daejeong the offices of 'Gunsu' (county chief) were re-established. The very next year, the office of 'Gunsu' was abolished and the old system was restored.

Then in 1906, abolishing the Moksa system altogether, the Gunsu or County chief system was adopted. In 1910, Jeongui and Daejeong were included in Jeju gun while Chuja-myeon was placed under the jurisdiction of Wando-gun, part of South Jeolla province.

Japan annexed Korea in 1910. In 1915, the ''gun'' or county system that had been adopted in 1906 was abolished and Jeju island was designated as part of the 'island' system and called Jeju myeon under South Jeolla province. In 1931, Jeju-myeon was raised to the status of Jeju-eup or 'township,' which gave the island one township (today's Jeju-si area) and 12 'myeon'. In 1945, Japan relinquished sovereignty over Korea and on September 1, 1955, Jeju Township was elevated to city status with 40 administrative wards, which, on January 1, 1962, were reduced to 14 wards. On July 8, 1956, Seogwi, Daejeong and Hallim-myeons were raised to the status of townships while the southwestern portion of Hallim Township was separated and newly designated as the Hankyeong district (myeon), which gave the province one city, two counties, three townships and 10 myeon or districts with 14 wards in Jeju City. May 23, 1979, saw the restructuring of the Jeju-si wards and the addition of three more, giving 17 wards.

In March 1980, the construction of a new provincial office was started in Yeon-dong of Jeju-si and in December of that year the four myeon of Aewol, Gujwa, Namwon and Seongsan were elevated to the status of townships giving the administrative area one city, two counties, seven townships, six districts and, within Jeju-si, 17 wards.

In 1981, the development of the Jungmun Tourist Complex brought about the unification of Seogwi township and Jungmun-myeon (district) into one as Seogwipo-si consisting of 12 wards (dong) giving the province two cities, two counties, six townships, five districts and 29 wards. On October 1, 1983, Jeju-si's Samdo ward was divided into two wards to give a total of 30 wards in the province.

Yongdam ward in Jeju-si was restructured into Yongdam ward one and Yongdam ward two on October 1, 1985. On April 1, 1986, Jocheon myeon (district) was elevated to the status of Township and Yeonpyeong-ri Gujwa township was raised to the status of Udo district (myeon). The provincial area now administered 2 cities, 2 counties, 7 townships, 5 districts and 31 wards, the status of the province as of  December 3, 1996.

===Current===

Until 2005, Jeju Province was divided into two cities (''si''), Jeju and Seogwipo, and two counties (''gun''), [[Bukjeju County|Bukjeju]] (North Jeju), and [[Namjeju County|Namjeju]] (South Jeju), respectively. The two cities were further divided into thirty-one neighborhoods (''dong''). In contrast, the two counties were split into seven towns (''eup'') and five districts (''myeon''). The seven cities and five districts were then divided into 551 villages (''ri'').

In 2005, Jeju residents approved, by referendum, a proposal to merge Bukjeju County into [[Jeju City]], and Namjeju County into [[Seogwipo|Seogwipo City]]. Effective July 1, 2006, the province was also renamed Jeju Special Self-Governing Province with two minor subdivisions, Jeju City and Seogwipo City. In addition to the changes in name, the province was given extensive administrative powers that had previously been reserved for the central government. This is part of a plans to turn Jeju into a "Free International City."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/200507/kt2005072817091154050.htm|title=Cheju Consolidation Vote|work=[[The Korea Times]] July 28, 2005|access-date=July 29, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129091740/http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/200507/kt2005072817091154050.htm |archive-date=November 29, 2005 }}</ref>

Jeju, on July 1, 2006, was made into the first Self-Governing Province of South Korea.

====Naming====
In Korean, ''do'' is the phonetic transcription of two distinct ''[[hanja]]'' ([[Chinese character]]s) meaning "island" (島) and "province" (道). However, '''Jejudo''' generally refers to the island, while '''Jeju-do''' refers to the government administrative unit. The table below also includes the name of Jeju City, the provincial capital.

=== ''Jeongnang'' ===
{{Main article|Jeongnang}}
''Jeongnang'' are traditional entrance gates to private homes on the island. The gates are typically composed of three parallel wooden poles placed in holes in wood or stone pillars. They have a number of purposes, one of which is to quickly communicate to neighbors where the owner of the house is. If all three poles are lowered on one side, the owner of the house is at home. Raising poles expresses degrees of how far away from home the owner is; three raised poles indicates that the owner will be gone for a long time.<ref name=":05">{{Cite web |last=김 |first=순자 |script-title=ko:정낭 - 디지털서귀포문화대전 |url=https://www.grandculture.net/seogwipo/toc/GC04601603 |access-date=2024-07-02 |website=[[Encyclopedia of Korean Local Culture]] |archive-date=2024-06-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240625140758/https://www.grandculture.net/seogwipo/toc/GC04601603 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''Jeongnang'' have become increasingly less common, especially as more Jejuans have moved into apartments.{{Sfn|Jeong|Yun|2022|p=2}} In spite of this, the practice is still maintained in rural areas.{{Sfn|Jeong|Yun|2022|p=2}}

''Doldam'' refers to the traditional use of piled volcanic stones, often without any adhesives between them, on Jeju Island. Various structures, namely walls around fields (called ''batdam'') are created.

=== Matriarchical family structure and ''haenyeo'' ===
{{Main article|Haenyeo}}

Another distinct aspect of Jeju is the [[matriarchy|matriarchal]] family structure, found especially in Udo and Mara, but also present in the rest of the province. The best-known example of this is found among the ''[[haenyeo]]'' ("sea women"), who were often the heads of families, because they controlled the income. They earned their living from [[freediving]], often all year round in quite cold water without [[Scuba set|scuba gear]], in order to harvest [[abalone]]s, [[conch]]es, and a myriad of other marine products. It is thought that [[Woman|women]] are better at spending all day deep-water diving because they resist the cold better.<ref>{{cite web |author=Ernest S Campbell, MD |date=6 April 2019 |title=Acclimatization to Cold Water |url=http://scuba-doc.com/acclimatization-to-diving-in-cold-water/ |access-date=2024-01-05 |publisher=Scuba-doc.com |archive-date=2024-01-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240105113845/http://scuba-doc.com/acclimatization-to-diving-in-cold-water/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In the early 1960s, 21% of women on the island were free divers, providing 60% of the island's [[Fishery|fisheries]] revenue.<ref name="nyt-20140329">{{cite news |author=Choe Sang-Hun |date=29 March 2014 |title=Hardy Divers in Korea Strait, 'Sea Women' Are Dwindling |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/30/world/asia/hardy-divers-in-korea-strait-sea-women-are-dwindling.html |access-date=31 March 2014 |newspaper=New York Times |archive-date=30 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330045524/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/30/world/asia/hardy-divers-in-korea-strait-sea-women-are-dwindling.html |url-status=live }}</ref> However, because of rapid economic development and modernization, {{As of|2014|lc=y}} only about 4,500 haenyeo, most aged over 60, were still actively working.<ref name="nyt-20140329" /><ref>{{cite web |date= |title=Jeju Cyber Samdakwan :: Diving into the sea out of Jeju |url=http://english.jejusamda.com/common/c_dataView.php?id=F04030500&lang=_eng |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629084839/http://english.jejusamda.com/common/c_dataView.php?id=F04030500&lang=_eng |archive-date=June 29, 2007 |access-date=2013-08-25 |publisher=English.jejusamda.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=McConvey |first=Joel |date=2008-09-16 |title=Lady Good Divers &#124; BLOUIN ARTINFO |url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/28043/lady-good-divers/ |access-date=2013-08-25 |publisher=Artinfo.com |archive-date=2012-05-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516114058/http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/28043/lady-good-divers/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Cuisine==
[[File:Korean abalone porridge-Jeonbokjuk-03.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Jeonbokjuk]]'', [[abalone]] porridge]]

Jeju Island is the southernmost and largest island isolated from the [[Korean peninsula]]. Due to its lack of fresh water, paddy farming is only done on a small scale, with the cultivation of [[cereal crop]]s such as [[millet]], [[barnyard millet]], buckwheat, and barley being the main feature of agriculture. Therefore, the traditional Jeju meal generally consists of ''[[japgokbap]]'', which is a bowl of steamed multiple grains as a main dish, with salted dried fish called ''[[jaban (fish)|jaban]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://engdic.nate.com/dicsearch/view.html?i=216857 |script-title=ko:자반 |access-date=2011-07-14 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714155711/http://engdic.nate.com/dicsearch/view.html?i=216857 |archive-date=July 14, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=249408&v=44 |script-title=ko:자반 |access-date=2011-06-10 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610075137/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=249408&v=44 |archive-date=June 10, 2011 }}</ref> as [[banchan]] (side dishes), and a soup based on ''[[doenjang]]'' (soybean paste) such as ''baechuguk'' made with [[Napa cabbage]], ''kongnipguk'' made with soybean leaves, or ''muguk'' made with [[radish]]. Jeju dishes are made with simple ingredients, and the taste is generally salty.

Raw seafood called ''[[Hoe (food)|hoe]]'' is commonly consumed as a part of the meal. The warm weather affects Jeju cuisine in that ''gimjang'', preparing kimchi in late autumn for winter consumption, is not necessary to Jeju, as it is in the other provinces. Only a small amount of kimchi is pickled by Jeju locals. Representative main dishes in Jeju cuisine are porridge made with fish, seafood, seaweed, or mushrooms. Examples include ''[[jeonbokjuk]]'' made with [[abalone]], ''okdomjuk'' made with [[red tilefish]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?&masterno=828687&contentno=828687 |title=doopedia |work=encyber.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306033021/http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php |archive-date=2010-03-06 }}</ref> ''gingijuk'' (Jeju: 깅잇죽/겡잇죽; {{Korean|hangul=게죽|labels=no}}) made with small crabs called ''bangge'' (''[[Helice tridens]]''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?masterno=827986&contentno=827986 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130102154617/http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?masterno=827986&contentno=827986 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-02 |title=doopedia |work=encyber.com }}</ref> ''maeyeoksae juk'' made with young miyeok ({{Korean|hangul=미역|labels=no}}) ([[wakame]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?masterno=828654&contentno=828654 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120729002522/http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?masterno=828654&contentno=828654 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-29 |title=doopedia |work=encyber.com }}</ref> and ''chogijuk'' made with [[shiitake]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?masterno=828143&contentno=828143 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120729162126/http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?masterno=828143&contentno=828143 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-29 |title=doopedia |work=encyber.com }}</ref>

Gamgyul is a type of orange similar to the [[Mandarin orange]] or [[tangerine]], commonly harvested in Jeju island. Black pig is a delicacy on the island as well. Black pigs are famous for their black hair and their meat for its chewy texture. The meat is nutritious and does not have the unique smell of pork. Black pigs' other notable features are their long faces, narrow snouts and small ears that stand up. Horse meat is also a delicacy of the island.

==Myths and legends==
Within the Jeju province, numerous mythological tales and legends remain particularly prevalent; these are encompassed by the word ''yetmal'' ({{Korean|hangul=옛말}}, means 'old language'), responsible for conveying the entirety of the substance of a myth or folk tale, which, within the large majority of instances, occurs within the form of a proverb or philosophical statement. The aforementioned stories remain disseminated within the form of prose between speaker and listener, constituting oral tradition; each story contains a component of truth derived from events within the Jeju province. A. This fictional story could be oral literature but in the eye of ideological aspect, the story also becomes a philosophy. These stories may be classified as proverbs,  philosophical statements or folklore derived from the history of the island.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=ko:<국어국문학자료사전> |url= http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=692445&cid=41708&categoryId=41711|website=www.terms.naver.com }}</ref>

The characteristics of the stories of Jeju Province can be found within the form of natural and historical legend; for instance, within the ''Ahunahopgol'' legend ({{Korean|hangul=아흔아홉골 전설}}, means 'legend of 99 Valleys'), historical circumstances responsible for a lack of individuals with talent within leadership remains displayed, expressing the geometrical destiny perspective. The historical legends of the province generally concerned an individual of particular strength; however, the limitations of the island remain represented within the form of the alternative to the hero, the starving strong man. A primary example remains the ''malmurlee'' legend ({{Korean|hangul=말머리전설}}, 'head of horse'); This kind of story shows the limit of the people of the province, with the primary character remaining born as a strong hero as previously listed,  yet remaining incapable of overcoming historical isolation.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lee |first=Hyeon-sook |script-title=ko:설문대 할망이 제주시인을 만났다 |url=http://www.ihalla.com/read.php3?aid=1466694000539586084 |website={{ill|Halla Ilbo|ko|한라일보}} |date=24 June 2016 |access-date=27 June 2016 |archive-date=24 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624110428/http://www.ihalla.com/read.php3?aid=1466694000539586084 |url-status=live }}</ref>

A particular example of mythology within the province remains the myth of ''Seolmundae Halmang'', well known within Jeju; according to this myth, Seolmundae Halmang ("Grandmother Seolmundae") could reach from [[Seongsan Ilchulbong]] ("Sunrise Peak", a volcanic tuff cone on the seaboard of Jeju Island) to Guan Tal island at [[Aewol-eup]] in a single stride and to [[Hallasan]] within 2 strides. She was very strong, possessed 500 children and built Hallasan with seven scoops of earth. One day, Seolmundae Halmang was making soup for her sons while they were out hunting; while they were gone, she fell into the pot and drowned. On their return, they hungrily ate the soup, without knowing that it contained their mother; however, the youngest son knew, informing the remainder of the family, with the entirety of the family crying and transforming into 500 stones.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kim |first=Nam-jung |script-title=ko:설문대할망, 오돌또기 탐라에 얽힌 이야기 집대성 |url=http://news.kmib.co.kr/article/view.asp?arcid=0923536373&code=13150000&cp=nv |work=the kukminilbo |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829023405/http://news.kmib.co.kr/article/view.asp?arcid=0923536373&code=13150000&cp=nv |archive-date=2016-08-29 }}</ref>

While the economy booms with foreign travel, residents suffer negative repercussions of Jeju tourism. "Most commercial facilities are owned by foreigners and major companies."<ref name=":5" /> In addition to increasing tourism, issues such as beach pollution, traffic, and overconsumption of underground water present a problem.<ref name=":5" />

Due to extensive tourism, the pollution of beaches has become a serious problem. The local government of Jeju aspires to be carbon-free by 2030.<ref name=":5" /> "Nearly half of all-electric cars in South Korea are registered in Jeju".<ref name=":5" />

In addition to the aspirations of an additional airport and the expansion of tourism on the island, Jeju is home to a small technological hub. In 2005, the Jeju Science Park was created, a complex for technology companies and organizations. Since its implementation, it has attracted 117 IT and biotech companies and is home to the Daum Kakao Corporation headquarters.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Too Reliant on Tourism?

'''Hallim Park'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hallimpark.co.kr/|title=Hallim Park|access-date=25 April 2016|archive-date=23 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423073739/http://www.hallimpark.co.kr/|url-status=live}}</ref> is one of the oldest and most popular tourist attractions on Jeju. It is on the west coast.

There is an annual fire festival on the island that stems from a custom of removing harmful insects and old grass in villages in winter. The fire festival is held on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month. Dal-gip (to pile up much wood) is burned when the moon rises while praying for good harvests and making good wishes. Jeju traditional food is eaten at the site of the festival. This festival was held 13 times until 2009. The "Jeju Jeongwol Daeboreum Fire Festival" started in 1997 and become a leading festival of Jeju. This takes place in Saebyeol Oreum in Bongseong ri, Aewol Eup. It takes up to 25 minutes to reach it from Jeju International Airport by car. Jeju citizens do their utmost to prepare the Fire Festival so as to pass down, develop, and ultimately develop branding for the unique folk culture resources of Jeju.

Saebyeol oreum has a characteristic of a complex volcano. It has a horseshoe-shaped crater that is both very wide and slightly split. It rises high with the little peaks making an oval from the south peak to northwest. The scale is [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] {{convert|519.3|m|sp=us}}, height of {{convert|119|m|abbr=on}}, circumference of {{convert|2,713|m|abbr=on}}, area of {{convert|522,216|m2|sqmi|abbr=on|sp=us}}. Saebyeol oreum is the middle size among the 360 oreums on Jeju island. It is named after the saying "it brightens like a star."

'''Olle'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jejuolle.org/|script-title=ko:제주올레|work=jejuolle.org|access-date=2011-07-12|archive-date=2011-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722225300/http://www.jejuolle.org/|url-status=live}}</ref> is a word in the local dialect that refers to the paths between houses and public roads.

The [[Olle road|Jeju Olle Trail]], called Jeju Olle Gil or simply "jejuolle" in Korean, is a long-distance footpath on Jeju Island. The course, mostly following the coastline, consists of 21 connected, numbered main courses, 5 major spurs, and a short spur that connects to Jeju Airport. The courses have an average length of {{convert|16|km|sp=us}} and all together total {{convert|404|km|abbr=on}}. The exact length and locations change over time as trails are modified or re-routed.

The courses pass through small villages, cross beaches, wind through farms and orchards, twist through forests, and climb oreums ("low parasitic volcanoes") across Jeju Island.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

'''Manjanggul'''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jejuweekly.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=1304|title=Take a unique 1-kilometer subterranean stroll - JEJU WEEKLY|work=jejuweekly.com|access-date=2011-03-03|archive-date=2011-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713101028/http://www.jejuweekly.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=1304|url-status=live}}</ref> is one of the longest lava tubes in the world. Manjang Cave, at Donggimnyeong-ri, Gujwa-eup, North Jeju, {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} east of Jeju City, was designated as Natural Monument No. 98 on March 28, 1970. The annual temperature inside the cave ranges from 11&nbsp;°C to 21&nbsp;°C, thus facilitating a favorable environment throughout the year.

The cave is academically significant as rare species live in the cave. Created by spewing lava, "the [[lava turtle]]", "lava pillar", and "wing-shaped wall" look like the work of the gods. It is considered to be a world-class tourist attraction.

The Geomunoreum lava tube system is the most impressive and significant series of protected lava tubes in the world and includes a spectacular array of secondary carbonate speleothems (stalactites and other formations). It overwhelms other lava tubes with its abundance and diversity. The Geomunoreum lava tube system, which is regarded as the finest such cave system in the world, has an outstanding visual impact even for those experienced with such phenomena. It displays the unique spectacle of multi-colored carbonate decorations adorning the roofs and floors, and dark-colored lava walls, partially covered by a mural of carbonate deposits.

In addition, lava tubes are like those in limestone karst in scale, shape, and internal decoration, but completely different in origin. Lava tubes are known from basaltic terrain in most of the world's volcanic regions. The lava tubes of the Geomunoreum system are, however, regarded as internationally important due to their length, massive volume, intricate passage configuration, well preserved internal lava features, abundant and spectacular secondary carbonate formations, ease of access, and their scientific and educational values. Another feature making Geomunoreum globally significant and distinctive is the presence of carbonate deposits and formations. Very small deposits of calcite are common in lava tubes and are more significantly developed as speleothems in Duck Creek cave in the U.S. state of [[Utah]]. However, in abundance, density and diversity they are far less impressive than those of Yongcheongul and Dangcheomuldonggul lava tubes in Jeju, and the scale of these decorations within the [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325971928_Geological_Heritage_Values_of_the_Yongcheon_Cave_Lava_Tube_Cave_Jeju_Island_Korea lava caves of Jeju Island] far exceeds any other comparable examples. The nomination is supported by the Commission on Volcanic Caves of the [[International Union of Speleology]] — the world's most authoritative scientific body on volcanic caves — which regards Jeju's lava caves as being of the highest international ranking. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325971928_Geological_Heritage_Values_of_the_Yongcheon_Cave_Lava_Tube_Cave_Jeju_Island_Korea Yongcheon Gul Lava Tube] has been discovered subsequently and is of equivalent value.

[[File:Sangumburi volcanic crater.jpg|thumb|Sangumburi volcanic crater]]
'''Sangumburi Crater'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sangumburi.net/|script-title=ko:넓고 넓은 신비의 화구, 끝없이 펼쳐진 대평원.. 산굼부리...|website=www.sangumburi.net|access-date=2011-07-12|archive-date=2011-07-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715232232/http://www.sangumburi.net/|url-status=live}}</ref> is the crater of an extinct volcano. Unlike its brethren Halla-san and Songsan Ilch'ubong, this one exploded quickly but did not spew much lava nor did it form much of a surrounding cone. This phenomenon is called maru in Korean, and Sangumburi is the only one of its kind in the country, making it Natural Monument #263. The remaining crater is {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} deep and an average of {{convert|350|m|abbr=on}}s across. Over 400 species of plants and animals live inside the crater.

Visitors can walk around part of the rim (the rest is private property and fenced off), but they cannot venture down inside the crater. A well-paved path leads from the parking area to the viewing area, which has a small pavilion and several vista points. Also on the grounds are gravesites made in traditional Jeju fashion: a wide, trapezoidal stone wall surrounding the burial mound. Several of the sites have small stone figures that guard the mound against evil spirits. At the park entrance are large rocks from the crater. During the eruption, molten rock flew from the volcano into the air and cooled into many exotic shapes.

'''[[Seongsan Ilchulbong]]''', also called 'Sunrise Peak', is an archetypal [[Phreatomagmatic eruption|tuff cone]] formed by [[hydrovolcanic eruption]]s upon a shallow seabed about 5,000 years ago. On the eastern seaboard of [[Jeju Island]] and said to resemble a gigantic ancient castle, this tuff cone is 182 meters high, has a preserved bowl-like crater, and displays diverse inner structures resulting from the sea cliff. These features are considered to be of geologic worth, providing information on eruptive and depositional processes of hydromagnetic volcanoes worldwide as well as past volcanic activity of Seongsan Ilchulbong itself.

'''[http://english.jeju.go.kr/index.php/contents/Tour/TouristAttractions?cat=TU08&act=view&seq=345 Oedolgae]''' is a 20-meter-tall pillar-shaped rock in Sammaebong, [[Seogwipo]]. It was created 1.5 million years ago by a volcanic eruption. At the top of Oedolgae, there are pine trees growing naturally. According to legend, an old woman became a rock after waiting for her husband who went to sea to catch fish and didn't return for a long time. So people call it 'halmang bawi' meaning grandmother rock. On the left side of Oedolgae, there is a rock called someri bawi. A large grass area covers the rock, and the surrounding area is great for fishing. Oedolgae is a popular tourist destination, particularly with foreigners.

'''Hallasan'''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.tour2jeju.net/ |title=Jeju Special Self-Governing Province |publisher=English.tour2jeju.net |access-date=2013-08-25 |archive-date=2016-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018102247/http://www.english.tour2jeju.net/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> is the mountain of one of the three gods. It stands at the center of Jeju Island, spreading east and west. The east face is steep, the north side is gentle, and the east and west form a flat, wide highland. Hallasan is a dormant volcano created by volcanic activities during the [[quaternary period]] of the [[Cenozoic era]]. It is primarily covered with basalt. On its top is a crater and Baeknok Lake. This mountain is home to alpine plants and houses as many as 1,800 species of flora. It also boasts luxuriant natural forests and vast grasslands.

The {{convert|43|km|adj=on|sp=us}} long Road 5.16 crossing the eastern waist of the mountain from Jeju City to Seogwipo City is considered to be one of the best tourist roads in Korea. Along this road, there are many tourist attractions such as Sancheondan and Seongpanak. People can enjoy the royal azalea blossoms in spring, lush, green woods in summer, colorful foliage in fall, and a landscape of snow in winter.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The {{convert|37|km||adj=mid|-long|sp=us}} Road 110 crossing the western waist of the mountain from Jeju-si to Jungmun runs through a high area that is {{convert|1,100|m|sp=us}} high above sea level. It passes by the Eoseungsang Reservoir, which is a source of water for Jeju islanders. The 99 Passes where, a legend says, neither a king nor a tiger is born because it is one short to 100 passes.{{??}} It also passes closely by Youngsil Giam (Youngsil Grotesque Rocks). It is possible to climb up to Wetse Oreum along Eorimok Trail and Youngsil Trail and to the top along Seongpanak Trail and Kwaneumsa Temple Trail.

'''[[Udo (island)|Udo]]''', (also called U-island, since do means island) is on the northeast of Seongsan-ri, 3.5 kilometres (2.2 miles) off the coast. This is the largest of the islands included in [[Jeju-si]]. Udo, literally "Cow Island" in Chinese, has this name because it looks like a cow lying down. The whole of Udo is a [[lava plateau]] and a fertile flatland where major agricultural products such as sweet potatoes, garlic, and peanuts are produced. There is a [[parasitic cone]], called ''shoi meori oreum'', in the southeast.

'''[[Jungmun Saekdal Beach]]''' is at the Saekdal-dong, [[Seogwipo]]. It is near the hotel zone it has convenient accessibility: Sinla Jeju hotel, Lotte hotel, Jeju Hana hotel are around 2 kilometers near the beach. Jungmun Saekdal Beach has a particular geographical feature. The beach shore is faced to the north and the water level is steady knee height until about 200 meters off the shore. There are many big and small waves under the influences of the Maparam ({{Korean|hangul=마파람}}, which means the wind from the north in Korean) so the beach is clouded by the people who came from many other regions to enjoy surfing in summer.

'''[[Aqua Planet Jeju]]'''　In Seogwipo City, there is the largest [[public aquarium]] "Aqua Planet Jeju ({{Korean|hangul=아쿠 아플라넷 제주|labels=no}})" in Korea.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hanwharesort.co.kr/irsweb/resort3/tpark/aqua_tp_intro.do|title=Hanwha Aqua Planet Jeju|website=hanwha resort|access-date=2021-05-28|archive-date=2021-04-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210422031249/https://www.hanwharesort.co.kr/irsweb/resort3/tpark/aqua_tp_intro.do|url-status=live}}</ref> Korea's largest tank of {{Convert|5300|m3|gal|abbr=on}} "The Sea of Jeju" is popular.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.joins.com/article/10435056　|script-title=ko:한화 아쿠아플라넷 제주, 바닷속 친구들 다 모였네|website=[[JoongAng Ilbo]]|language=en|access-date=2021-05-28}}</ref>

Jeju has three UNESCO World Heritage sites, and is "packed with museums and theme parks and also has horses, mountains, lava tube caves, and waterfalls with clear blue ocean lapping its beaches."<ref name=":3" /> The [[Haenyeo]] (Jeju female divers) harvest oysters, abalone, clams, seaweed and other marine life, and their history is showcased at the island's Haenyeo museum.<ref name=":5" />

One of the most popular surfing spots in Korea, Jeju Island is also the birthplace of Korean surfing. Some famous beaches are [[Weoljung Beach]] and [[Jungmun Saekdal Beach|Jungmun Beach]]. The latter is home to the first surfing club in Korea, established in 1995.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/travel/2018/08/03/5-surfing-spots-to-ride-the-wave-in-korea.html|title=5 surfing spots to ride the wave in Korea|last=Park|first=Jin Won|date=2018-08-03|newspaper=[[The Jakarta Post]]|language=en|access-date=2020-02-26|archive-date=2020-02-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200226065044/https://www.thejakartapost.com/travel/2018/08/03/5-surfing-spots-to-ride-the-wave-in-korea.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

There are small islands near Jeju Island that visitors can visit by boat; the most famous of these are Udo, Gapado, and Marado. Udo is famous for its peanut ice cream and boat tours.<ref>{{Cite web|script-title=ko:우도(해양도립공원)|url=https://www.visitjeju.net/kr/detail/view?contentsid=CONT_000000000500477|access-date=2021-04-08|website=Visitjeju.net|language=ko|archive-date=2021-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210419210942/https://www.visitjeju.net/kr/detail/view?contentsid=CONT_000000000500477|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2002, [[scarlet fever]] was reported to be in Korean children in Jeju Province.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Jinhee|last2=Kim|first2=Ji-Eun|last3=Bae|first3=Jong-Myon|date=May 2019|title=Incidence of Scarlet Fever in Children in Jeju Province, Korea, 2002-2016: An Age-period-cohort Analysis|journal=Journal of Preventive Medicine and Public Health|volume=52|issue=3|pages=188–194|doi=10.3961/jpmph.18.299|issn=1975-8375|pmc=6549015|pmid=31163954}}</ref> Scientists have been doing research on the matter by creating an age-period-cohort (APC) analysis to back up their relevant hypotheses regarding this emerging outbreak. The Korean National Health Insurance Service analyzed this data from the nationwide insurance claims. Their calculations of the crude incidence rate (CIR) and applying the intrinsic estimator (IE) for age and calendar groups revealed that a total of 2,345 cases of children had the fever that was one of the top illnesses. It also led to the discovery that children aged 0–2 were the most common victims of the fever and that it was mostly boys rather than girls that carried it. The CIR decreased with age between 2002 and 2016 and the age period effect decreased in all observed years. The IE coefficients validating a cohort effect went from negative to positive in 2009. To this day, no one can explain how these children in Jeju Province had scarlet fever, but results suggest that it might be explained through the cohort effect. Further descriptive epidemiological studies are needed to test children that are born after 2009, to determine whether they have the fever or not.

Studies show that Jeju Province is recorded as the region showing the highest incidence of severe fever with [[Thrombocytopenia|thrombocytopenia syndrome]] (SFTS) in South Korea.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Yoo|first1=Jeong Rae|last2=Heo|first2=Sang Taek|last3=Kim|first3=Miyeon|last4=Song|first4=Sung Wook|last5=Boo|first5=Ji Whan|last6=Lee|first6=Keun Hwa|date=2019-12-01|title=Seroprevalence of Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome in the Agricultural Population of Jeju Island, Korea, 2015–2017|journal=Infection and Chemotherapy|language=en|volume=51|issue=4|pages=337–344|doi=10.3947/ic.2019.51.4.337|pmid=31668024|pmc=6940373|issn=1598-8112}}{{Dead link|date=March 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Just like the scarlet fever, the goal of this study was to determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SFTS patients in Jeju Province. The data that was collected on this situation were obtained by the Integrated Diseases and Health Control System of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDCIS). 55 residents of Jeju were selected to test the criteria at KCDCIS and confirm the cases of SFTS with a residence listed in Jeju Province at the time of diagnosis, between July 16, 2014, and November 30, 2018. Results show that of the 55 confirmed cases of SFTS, the case fatality rate was 10.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 22.2). The most common symptoms of the SFTS were severe fever, myalgia, and diarrhea. There have been fatality rates of 83.6% (95% Cl, 71.2 to 92.2), 45.5% (95% Cl, 32.0 to 59.5), and 40.0% (95% CI, 27.0 to 54.1). This particular study from 2014 to 2018, has been proven to have a lower case fatality rate and a lower incidence of severe fever, myalgia, and confusion than that of the cases nationwide of 2013–2015.

==Utilities==
The island's power grid is connected to mainland plants by the [[HVDC Haenam–Cheju]], and electricity is also provided by generators located on the island. As of 2001, there were four power plants on Jeju, with more under planning and construction. The most notable of these are the gas-fired generators of Jeju Thermal Power Plant, located in Jeju City. The present-day generators of this plant were constructed from 1982 onwards, replacing earlier structures that dated from 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.komipo.co.kr/english/komipo/Bran_jeju.asp |title=Jeju Thermal P/P |work=Korea Midland Power website |access-date=July 29, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050616082124/http://www.komipo.co.kr/english/komipo/Bran_jeju.asp |archive-date=June 16, 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As elsewhere in Korea, the power supply is overseen by the [[Korea Electric Power Corporation]] (KEPCO).

In February 2012, the governor of the state of Hawaii (US), [[Neil Abercrombie]], and the director of the Electricity Market and [[Smart Grid]] Division at the Korea Ministry of Knowledge Economy, Choi Kyu-Chong, signed a letter of intent to share information about Smart Grid technology. The Jeju Smart Grid was initially installed in 6,000 homes in Gujwa-eup and is being expanded. South Korea is using the pilot program of the Smart Grid on Jejudo as the testing ground in order to implement a nationwide Smart Grid by 2030.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jejuweekly.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=2417 |publisher=The Jeju Weekly |date=Feb 24, 2012 |access-date=Mar 5, 2012 |title=Korea and Hawaii join forces in Smart Grid venture |archive-date=October 21, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211021104336/http://www.jejuweekly.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=2417 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Transportation==
[[Jeju City]] is the principal transportation center for Jeju Province. It is home to the island's sole airport, [[Jeju International Airport]]; the Jeju-Seoul route is the world's busiest airline route.

The island is served by [[Jeju International Airport]] in [[Jeju City]]. The Seoul–Jeju City air route is by a significant margin the [[World's busiest passenger air routes|world's busiest]], with around 13,400,000 passengers flown between the two cities in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/the-worlds-busiest-air-route-is-between-seoul-and-jeju-2016-12|title=The world's busiest air route is between Seoul and the 'South Korean Hawaii'|last=Murray|first=Tom|date=2018-07-21|website=Business Insider|access-date=2020-02-26|archive-date=2020-02-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200226062647/https://www.businessinsider.com/the-worlds-busiest-air-route-is-between-seoul-and-jeju-2016-12|url-status=live}}</ref> Other cities that have flights to Jeju are Daegu, [[Busan]], Gunsan and Gwangju.
