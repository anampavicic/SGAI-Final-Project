'''Bucaramanga''' ({{IPA|es|bukaɾaˈmaŋɡa}}) is the capital and largest city of the department of [[Santander Department|Santander]], [[Colombia]]. Bucaramanga has the fifth-largest economy by GDP in [[Colombia]], has the lowest unemployment rate and is the ninth most populous city in the country, with a population of 613,400 (2023 projection).<ref>[http://www.citypopulation.de/en/colombia/cities/ Citypopulation.de] Population of the major cities in Colombia</ref> Bucaramanga has over 160 parks scattered throughout the city and has been given the nickname "La Ciudad de Los Parques" ("The City of Parks") and "La Ciudad Bonita de Colombia" ("Colombia's Beautiful City").

Bucaramanga has grown rapidly since the 1960s, mostly into neighbouring locations within the metropolitan area. [[Floridablanca, Santander|Floridablanca]], [[San Juan de Girón|Girón]] and [[Piedecuesta]] are inextricably linked geographically and commercially with Bucaramanga, and now all form together the Bucaramanga Metropolitan Area with a population of 1,304,288.<ref name="Largest cities or towns"/>

The city is the base of the Colombian Petroleum Institute (ICP),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecopetrol.com.co/ |language=es |title=Colombian Petroleum Institute (ICP) |access-date=1 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116093420/http://ecopetrol.com.co/ |archive-date=16 January 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> the research branch of the state oil company [[Ecopetrol]].

==History==
[[File:Bucaramanga en 1851.jpg|thumb|left|Bucaramanga in 1851]]
[[Girón, Santander|Girón]] was the first and most significant town founded by Spanish colonialists in the region, and Bucaramanga (founded on 22 December 1622) did not overtake Girón in population or economic significance until the early 19th century. Bucaramanga was born as an indigenous town since the economic activity that occurred for the first time in the area was the extraction of gold from the alluvial deposits that predominated in the region, mainly due to what is known as the La Rosita ravine. Until 1778, Bucaramanga was considered an indigenous town and it was in 1779 when it began to be called a Parish. The name it took was the Parish of Our Lady of Chiquinquira and San Laureano de la Real de Minas de Bucaramanga. The city attracted a core of German merchants and adventurers in the 1860s and 1870s (the most famous of whom was [[Geo von Lengerke]]) and tensions between the newcomers and local merchants flared in 1879, when the event named "La Culebra Pico de Oro" ("The Gold Beak Snake") occurred.{{clarify|date=November 2022}} With the political reorganization of 1886, Bucaramanga replaced [[Socorro, Santander|Socorro]] as the departmental capital. The region (although not the city itself) was devastated by the civil war of 1899–1902—commonly known as the [[Thousand Days War]]—causing Bucaramanga to grow only modestly in the first half of the 20th century.

==Climate==
Bucaramanga is located on a plateau in the [[Cordillera Oriental, Colombia|Cordillera Oriental]] of the [[Andean natural region|Colombian Andes]], and many residents occupy unstable lands descending steeply from the ''meseta''. Westbound of it, the Rio de Oro Canyon is located at an altitude of {{convert|600|m|}} [[Metres above sea level|above sea level]]. Eastbound, the Andean Range rises up in high peaks, reaching almost {{Convert|3700|m|}} [[Metres above sea level|AMSL]] in the place locally known as "Paramo de Berlin".
The city is located at {{Coord|7|08|N|73|08|W|}}. The official metropolitan area includes the municipalities of: [[Girón, Santander|Girón]], [[Piedecuesta]] and [[Floridablanca, Santander|Floridablanca]], but [[Lebrija, Santander|Lebrija]] is home to Bucaramanga's airport and is commonly considered part of greater Bucaramanga. Despite recent urbanization, all four neighboring municipalities contain extensive rural areas.

Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Bucaramanga features a [[tropical rainforest climate]] (''Af'' in [[Köppen climate classification]]), though a noticeably cool version of the climate. The city is slightly too dry for a [[tropical rainforest climate]], as its driest month of December averages just under {{convert|67|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rainfall. Although its altitude is not considered very high, Bucaramanga's climate is neither hot nor cold, 22 degrees [[Celsius]] being the average temperature. Compared to cities at the same average altitude (such as [[Cali]]), Bucaramanga has much cooler daytime temperatures, owing to the cold wind coming down the eastern peaks; its night temperatures are not cold, owing to the warm air coming from the canyon. These phenomena make the daily thermal oscillation narrower than in other Colombian cities.

In the following years, three more shopping centers were built in other areas of the city: Cacique, Parque Caracolí, and De la Cuesta. Another shopping district known as "Cabecera del Llano" includes five major shopping centers: Cabecera Etapa I, Etapa II and Etapa III, as well as the more recognized Cabecera Etapa IV and the shopping center "La Quinta" or V Etapa.

== Culture ==
[[File:FHB 0144.jpg|thumb|Museum of Modern Art in Bucaramanga]]

Bucaramanga's culture has several expressions, from the visual arts such as painting, sculpture, photography, and recently also in experimental demonstrations that incorporate new technology for artistic communication, such as video. Throughout Bucaramanga's history, it has hosted many cultural offerings in various areas, causing arts groups to form within the city.

One of the main pillars of culture in Bucaramanga is literature, as in the past there was a local cultural movement that produced a number of writers.

In 1995, the administration of Mayor Luis Fernando Peña Cote decided to convert Gabriel Turbay Public Library to hold the newly created Municipal Institute of Culture, assigning the library building to Gabriel Turbay, who has overseen space management for the institute, which has meant the movement of areas of the library to use the administrative area of the Municipal Institute of Culture. The creation of the Municipal Institute of Culture was conceived in order to expand the possibilities for sponsoring culture in the metropolitan area. But as culture has not traditionally played a leading role in local government, colleges do not receive sufficient funding and incentives to fulfill their purposes.

The Institute provides library services, art workshops, and a variety of shows and cultural work from the different neighborhoods of the city. The city sponsors these cultural activities with private investment. Bucaramanga also features a cultural radio station (Station Cultural Luis Carlos Galán Sarmiento) on 100.7 FM.

=== Gastronomy ===
[[File:Arepa y Tamal Santandereano.jpg|thumb|Corn arepa (arepa de maiz pelado) and tamal are some of the typical dishes of Santander.]]

Typical dishes from Bucaramanga include [[Mute (food)|mute santandereano]] (a soup made from various grains, vegetables, herbs and meat), [[fricassee]], a preparation of viscera and goat blood mixed with white rice, roasted meat, arepa de maize pelado, and [[tamales]].

Also popular are caramels and candied items such as celery, lemon, citrón, rice, and pineapple. Most sweets are produced in the Floridablanca neighboring. The [[oblea]], (a large, [[Holy communion]]-like wafer), and bocadillo veleño (a type of fudge made from puréed fruit or pressed caramel, or [[dulce de leche]]/milk caramel), are examples of treats found in great quantity in Bucaramanga. 

Nevertheless, one of the most exotic foods in this Colombian city is undoubtedly the “[[Atta laevigata|hormigas culonas]]”, or “big-butt ants”, which have made Bucaramanga famous nationally and internationally; the speciality has even been exported to Tokyo and London. These ants have a naturally high protein content, and their consumption among local peoples dates from well before the colonial era. This delicacy is only available seasonally, due to the ants only emerging from underground during the months of May and June.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.semana.com/especiales/articulo/las-hormigas-culonas/79609-3 |language=es |title=Las Hormigas Culonas |date=24 June 2006 |access-date=28 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129005850/https://www.semana.com/especiales/articulo/las-hormigas-culonas/79609-3 |archive-date=29 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>
