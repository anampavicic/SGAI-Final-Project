The city's name literally means "silver river".

Yinchuan is now the permanent site for the China-Arab Expo, a platform for cultural and economic exchanges between [[China]] and [[Arab world|Arab countries]].

The city is also home to [[Ningxia University]], the largest regional comprehensive university under Ningxia's [[Project 211]].

==History==
[[File:Txu-pclmaps-oclc-22834566 g-9a.jpg|left|thumb|Map including Yinchuan]]

Yinchuan was originally a county under the name of ''Fuping'' in the 1st century BCE; its name was changed to ''Huaiyuan'' in the 6th century CE.

=== Western Xia and Mongol Conquest ===
After the fall of the [[Tang dynasty]] in 907, Yinchuan came under the control of the [[Tangut people|Tangut]]s. In 1038, the Tangut leader [[Emperor Jingzong of Western Xia|Yuanhao]] declared himself emperor of the [[Western Xia|Great Xia]] and made Yinchuan his capital, at that time known as "Xingqing" ({{zh|t=興慶|s=兴庆|p=Xīngqìng}}).<ref name=cam>{{cite book|author1=Denis C.

In the autumn of 1209, [[Mongol conquest of Western Xia|the Mongols invaded Western Xia]]. They laid siege to Yinchuan, which by this point was known as "Zhongxing". The garrison of 150,000 managed to hold out against the Mongols, although Western Xia submitted to Mongol suzerainty regardless.<ref name="Weatherford"/><ref name="tim may 1211">{{cite book|last=May|first=Timothy|title=The Mongol Conquests in World History|year=2012|publisher=[[Reaktion Books]]|location=London|isbn=9781861899712|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZRIt9sZaTREC|page=1211}}</ref> After Xia attempted to reassert its independence, in 1227 the Mongols returned and slaughtered the city's entire population.

=== Ming and Qing dynasties ===
Under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] (1368–1644) and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] (1644–1911) dynasties, it was a [[Prefecture (China)|prefecture]] of [[Ningxia]]. During the [[Dungan Revolt (1862–77)|Dungan revolt]], Dungan forces massacred 100,000 people in Yinchuan.

In 1739, the city was heavily affected by the [[1739 Yinchuan–Pingluo earthquake|Yinchuan–Pingluo earthquake]]. A maximum intensity of XII was determined on the [[China seismic intensity scale|Chinese seismic intensity scale]], and XI on the Mercalli intensity scale. The earthquake collapsed most houses, temples, offices, and a city wall {{cvt|10|m}} tall and {{cvt|6|m}} wide. Ground fissures up to an meter wide, and {{cvt|100|m}} long, and great subsidence were accounted in historical records.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=ZHANG BUCHUN, LIAO YUHUA, GUO SHUNMIN, ROBERT E.

=== 20th century ===
In 1928, when the province of Ningxia was formed from part of [[Gansu]], Yinchuan became the capital city. In 1954, when [[Ningxia]] province was abolished, the city was put in Gansu province; but, with the establishment of the Ningxia Hui autonomous region in 1958, Yinchuan once again became the capital.

Traditionally, Yinchuan was an administrative and commercial center. In the 1950s, the city had many commercial enterprises, and there were some handicrafts, but no modern industry. The city has since grown considerably. Extensive coal deposits discovered on the eastern bank of the [[Yellow River]], near [[Shizuishan]], {{cvt|100|km}} to the north, have made Shizuishan a coal-mining center.

Yinchuan, however, remains largely non-industrial. The immediate plains area, intensively irrigated by a system developed as long ago as the [[Han dynasty|Han]] (206 BC–AD 220) and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] (618–907) dynasties, is extremely productive. Yinchuan is the chief agricultural market and distribution center for this area and also deals in animal products from the herds tended by nomads in the surrounding grasslands. It is a market for grain and has flour mills, as well as rice-hulling and oil-extraction plants. The wool produced in the surrounding plains supplies a woolen-textile mill.

During the [[1989 Chinese protests by region|nationwide 1989 Protests]] that followed the death of [[Hu Yaobang]], Yinchuan was the site of student demonstrations responding to the [[April 26 Editorial]].<ref>Zhang Liang. ''The Tiananmen Papers''. New York: PublicAffairs, 2001. {{ISBN|978-1-58648-122-3}}. p. 181.</ref> On May 28 numbers dropped drastically when only 3,000 students took to the streets.<ref>Zhang Liang.

On July 23, 1993, [[China Northwest Airlines Flight 2119]], in route from [[Yinchuan Xihuayuan Airport]] to [[Beijing Capital International Airport]], crashed into a lake after it was unable to get airborne while attempting to take off at Yinchuan Airport, killing 54 passengers and 1 crew member on board.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Accident Database: Accident Synopsis 07231993|url=http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=07231993&reg=B-2716&airline=China+Northwest+Airlines|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321195110/http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=07231993&reg=B-2716&airline=China+Northwest+Airlines|archive-date=2015-03-21|access-date=2021-01-09|url-status=usurped|website=airdisaster.com}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Yinchuan 106.27246E 38.46797N.jpg|left|thumb|Satellite image of Yinchuan in 2005]]
Yinchuan lies in the middle of the [[Yinchuan Plain]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Soil Bulletin, Volume 15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tdtNAAAAYAAJ|year=1983|publisher=[[Sciences Press]]|pages=171–}}</ref> It is sheltered from the deserts of Mongolia by the high ranges of the [[Helan Mountains]] to its west. The Yellow River runs through Yinchuan from southwest to northeast. The average elevation of Yinchuan is 1,100 meters (about 3,608 feet). The urban center of Yinchuan lies about halfway between the Yellow River and the edge of Helan Mountains.

===Climate===
Yinchuan has a cold [[desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BWk'') with an annual rainfall of {{cvt|194|mm|2}}. Yinchuan has distinct seasons, with dry, cold winters, late springs and short summers. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from {{cvt|−6.8|°C|1}} in January to {{cvt|24.4|°C|1}} in July, with the annual mean at {{cvt|10.1|°C|1}}. Diurnal temperature variation tends to be large due to the aridity, which also partly contributes to the sunny climate; with monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 58&nbsp;percent in January to 67&nbsp;percent in November, the city receives 2,761 hours of bright sunshine annually. There are 158 frost-free days.

In Q1 2018, Yinchuan ranked first in traffic congestion severity in China. According to research by [[AutoNavi]], and the Planning and Research Institute of the [[Ministry of Transport (China)|Ministry of Transport]], this was caused by numerous construction works and the poor structure of the road network, rather than pure traffic volume.<ref>{{Cite web |title=银川成一季度首堵城市 曝“城市病”旧疾-新华网 |url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2018-05/08/c_1122797924.htm |access-date=2024-08-16 |website=www.xinhuanet.com}}</ref> After reorganization of the road network and bottleneck intersections, congestion has reduced.<ref>{{Cite web |title=银川持续打好交通疏堵攻坚战 提升群众出行幸福感-宁夏新闻网 |url=https://www.nxnews.net/ds/gydt/202308/t20230817_8357408.html |access-date=2024-08-16 |website=www.nxnews.net}}</ref>

Although most residents are Han Chinese, Yinchuan is a center for the Muslim [[Hui people]], who constitute slightly over a quarter of the population.<ref name=":0" /> Hui Muslims play a vital role as being middlemen in trade between the Middle East and China, and the China-Middle East trade has become increasingly important to the country. Consequently, the national government has started constructing a $3.7 billion Islamic theme park called "World Muslim City" in Yinchuan. Unlike Uyghurs, who faces far more restrictions in religious freedoms, Hui Muslims generally do not seek independence from China and have a cultural affinity to the Han, and are far more [[Sinicization|assimilated into mainstream Chinese life]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=If China Is Anti-Islam, Why Are These Chinese Muslims Enjoying a Faith Revival?|url=https://time.com/3099950/china-muslim-hui-xinjiang-uighur-islam/|access-date=2021-12-06|magazine=Time|language=en}}</ref>
