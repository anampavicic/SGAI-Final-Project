'''Bolu''', formerly '''Claudiopolis''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Κλαυδιούπολις), is a city in northern [[Turkey]], and administrative center of the [[Bolu Province]] and of [[Bolu District]],<ref name=il>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx İl Belediyesi], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 30 January 2023.</ref> located on the highway between [[Istanbul]] and [[Ankara]]. Its population is 184,682 (2021).<ref name=tuik>{{Cite web |title=Address-based population registration system (ADNKS) results dated 31 December 2021|url=https://www.tuik.gov.tr/indir/duyuru/favori_raporlar.xlsx |access-date=30 January 2023|publisher=[[TÜİK]]|language=tr |format=XLS}}</ref>
 
The city has been governed by mayor Tanju Özcan ([[Republican People's Party|CHP]]) since [[2019 Turkish local elections|local elections in 2019]]. It was the site of Ancient Claudiopolis and has also been called Eskihisar ("old fortress") (and as such has several Turkish namesakes).

The old highway ([[State road D.100 (Turkey)|D-100]]) between [[Ankara]] and [[Istanbul]] climbs over Mount Bolu, while the new motorway ([[European route E80|E-80]]) passes through [[Mount Bolu Tunnel]], a little distance from the town. It is situated at {{cvt|742|m}} above sea level on the southern slopes of a bare hill.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bolu {{!}} Turkey|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Bolu|access-date=2021-09-20|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

[[File:TR Bolu asv2021-10 img21 Peace Dove.jpg|thumb|Sculpture of the Peace Dove at the town hall]]
Bolu was part of one of the [[Hittites|Hittite]] kingdoms around 2000 BC and later 500 BC became one of the leading cities of the Greek Kingdom of [[Bithynia]] (279 BC - 79 BC). Bebryces, Mariandynes, Koukones, Thyns and Paphlagons are native people of the area in antique era. [[Strabo]] (XII, 4, 7) mentions a Hellenistic town, Bithynium ({{langx|el|Βιθύνιον}}), celebrated for its pastures and cheese, which according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (VIII, 9) was founded by [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]]ns from [[Mantinea]].<ref>[http://www.karalahana.com/karadeniz/Bolu%20tarihi.htm History of Bolu (tr)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511142126/http://www.karalahana.com/karadeniz/Bolu%20tarihi.htm |date=May 11, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.yeniansiklopedi.com/bolu/ |title=Bolu |access-date=2013-11-12 |archive-date=2016-03-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314091613/http://yeniansiklopedi.com/bolu |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the [[Ancient Roman]] era, as is shown by its coins, the town was commonly called '''Claudiopolis''' (Κλαυδιούπολις) after [[Emperor Claudius]]. It was the birthplace of [[Antinous]], the posthumously [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|deified]] lover of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Emperor [[Hadrian]], who was very generous to the city, and his name was later added to that of Claudius on the coins of the city. Emperor [[Theodosius II]] (408-50) made it the capital of a new province, formed out of Bithynia and [[Paphlagonia]], and called by him ''[[Honorias]]'' in honour of his younger son and successor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]].

The city was known under [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine rule]] as Hadrianopolis (like many others; not to be confused with Hadrianopolis in Honoriade, also Constanti(n)a, now [[Viranşehir]]). After the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in which the [[Byzantine]]s suffered a defeat at the hands of the [[Seljuks]], [[Turkmens]] migrating west settled the city in the 11th century and it was referred to as '''Boli''', Turkicized short for the Greek ''Polis'' 'city'. It was recaptured by [[Byzantine]]s in 1097 but was conquered by the Seljuk [[Sultanate of Rum]] in 1197.

=== The Ottoman era ===
In 1325, the town was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] under [[Orhan]] [[Ghazi (warrior)|Ghazi]], becoming known under the present Turkish name - sometimes called ''Bolou'' or ''Boli''. It was also ruled by [[Candaroğlu]] between 1402 and 1423. It became the chief town of a [[sanjak]] in the [[vilayet]] (province) of [[Kastamonu]] and had a population of 10,000 inhabitants. Bolu was an Ottoman [[eyalet]] (state) until the Charter of States (''Vilayetler Nizannamesi'') of 1864, and was within the area stretching from [[Beykoz]] [[kaza]]si of [[İzmid]] sanjak to [[Boyabat]] kazasi of [[Sinop Province|Sinop]] sanjak. In the late 19th and early 20th century, following the 1864 ''Vilayetler Nizannamesi'', Bolu was part of the [[Kastamonu Vilayet]] of the Empire.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
{{main|Claudiopolis in Honoriade}}

=== (Arch)Bishopric ===
As secular capital of the [[Roman province]] of Honorias, in the civil [[Diocese of Pontus]], the bishopric of Claudiopolis became the [[metropolitan see]], in the sway of the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]], with five [[suffragan]] sees : [[Heraclea Pontica]], [[Prusias ad Hypium]], [[Tium]], [[Gerede|Cratia]] and [[Hadrianopolis in Paphlagonia|Hadrianopolis in Honoriade]]. It appears as such in the ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]'' of Pseudo-Epiphanius of about 640 and in that of [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Leo VI the Wise]] of the early 10th century, ranking sixteenth viz. seventeenth among the Patriarchate's Metropolitans.
 
The city, known as Hadrianopolis (like many others) under [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine rule]] fell to [[Turkmens]] migrating west in the 11th century who called it Boli, was recaptured by Byzantines in 1097, [[Siege of Claudiopolis|besieged]] unsuccessfully by the [[Sultanate of Rum]] in 1179 and conquered in 1197. Under Ottoman rule since the 14th century it lost to [[Heraclea Pontica]] the Metropolitan dignity. It ceased to exist as a residential bishopric in the 15th century.

Michel [[Lequien]] mentions twenty bishops of the see to the 13th century; documentary mentions are available for the following incumbent (Arch)bishops :
* the first is [[St. Autonomus]], said to be an Italian missionary who suffered martyrdom under [[Diocletian]]. 
* Callicrates (mentioned in 363 in [[Socrates Scolasticus]]' church history)
* Gerontius (first actual historically documented bishop, in 394 attending the council against Metropolitan Bagadius of [[Bosra]].
* Olympius (in 431)
* Calogerus (449 - 458)
* Carterius (menzionato nel 459)
** Hypatus (circa 518) [dismissed by Janin]
* Epictetus (in 536)
** Vincentius (in 553) [dismissed by Janin]
* Ciprianus I (in 680)
** only Janin also includes a bishop Sisinnius, attending the [[council in Trullo]] (692), but apparently assigns the same to namesake see [[Claudiopolis in Isauria]]
* Nicetas I (in 787)
* Ignatius, a friend and correspondent of Patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople]]
* Ciprianus II (869 – 879)
* Nicetas II (10th–11th centuries)<ref>{{Catalogue of Byzantine Seals at Dumbarton Oaks and in the Fogg Museum of Art|volume=4 | page= 21}}</ref>
* John (1028 - 1029).

=== Titular see ===
The archdiocese was nominally restored by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as a Latin Metropolitan [[titular archbishopric]] no later than the seventeenth century, first named Claudiopolis (Latin) / Claudiopoli (Curiate Italian), renamed in 1933 as Claudiopolis in Honoriade (Latin) / '''Claudiopoli di Onoriade''' (Italiano) / Claudiopolitan(us) in Honoriade (Latin).<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 838</ref>

In Hıdırlıktepe, a tomb and the remains of a theatre have been uncovered. In Hisartepe, a temple believed to have been built by the Roman emperor [[Hadrian]] for his lover [[Antinous]] has been excavated.<ref name=larousse/> In 1911, it was noted that "in and around [Bolu] are numerous marbles with Greek inscriptions, chiefly sepulchral, and architectural fragments."<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Boli}}</ref>

[[Bolu Museum]] was established in 1975 to display and protect artifacts found in the Bolu area. It functions as both an archaeological and an ethnographic museum and is home to 3286 archaeological and 1677 ethnographic artifacts, as well as 12,095 historical coins.

=== Cuisine ===
Local specialities include a sweet made of hazelnuts (which grow in abundance here) and an eau-de-cologne with the scent of grass. One feature of Bolu dear to the local people is the soft spring water (''kökez suyu'') obtained from fountains in the town.

=== Media ===
Bolu is home to 12 local newspapers published in the city centre, two local TV channels (Köroğlu TV and Abant TV), three local radio stations and six local magazines.<ref>{{cite web|title=BOLU İLİ MAHALLİ BASIN KURULUŞLARI|url=http://www.bolu.gov.tr/yerel-basin|publisher=Bolu Governorship|access-date=23 January 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223042903/http://www.bolu.gov.tr/yerel-basin|archive-date=23 February 2016}}</ref>

== Economy ==
Bolu is a busy market town rather than a large city. It has one long shopping street and an attractive forested mountain countryside. Students from the [[University of Bolu|university]] and soldiers based in Bolu make an important contribution to the local economy, which traditionally depended on forestry and handicrafts. Market day is Monday, when people from the surrounding villages come into town for their weekly shop.

The main road from Istanbul to Ankara used to cross [[Mount Bolu]], although more people would stop at the roadside restaurants than actually come into the town, and anyway now the [[Mount Bolu Tunnel]] is open most people will rush by on the motorway rather than climb up into Bolu, especially in winter when the road has often been closed due to ice and snow. Some of the service stations on the mountain road have already announced their closure or moved elsewhere.

== Climate ==
Bolu has a borderline [[oceanic climate]] and [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Cfb,'' or [[Trewartha climate classification]]: ''Dcb''), with chilly, snowy winters and warm summers with cool nights. Bolu is a fairly cloudy and foggy city and annual sunshine hours are about 1,800. Unlike the low-lying, sheltered city center, many parts of the province, like [[Gerede]], have a colder [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfb/Dcb''), due to cold winters.
