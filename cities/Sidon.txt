'''Sidon''' ({{IPAc-en|'|s|ai|d|@n}} {{respell|SY|d…ôn}}) or '''Saida''' ({{IPAc-en|'|s|ai|d|@|,_|'|s|A:|I|d|@}} {{respell|SY|d…ô|,_|SAH|id|…ô}}; {{langx|ar|ÿµŸäÿØÿß|·π¢aydƒÅ}}) is the third-largest city in [[Lebanon]]. It is located on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast in the [[South Governorate, Lebanon|South Governorate]], of which it is the capital. [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], to the south, and the Lebanese capital of [[Beirut]], to the north, are both about {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} away. Sidon has a population of about 80,000 within the [[city limits]], while its [[metropolitan area]] has more than a quarter-million inhabitants.

==History==
{{Main|History of Sidon}}

In antiquity, Sidon held prominence as a significant [[Phoenicia]]n city. Nestled on a mainland promontory and boasting two harbors.<ref name=":02" /> Throughout ancient history, Sidon had many conquerors: [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]], [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonians]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], and finally [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Under Persian rule, it eclipsed [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] to become the paramount city in Phoenicia.<ref name=":02" /> In the New Testament era, [[Herod the Great]] visited Sidon. Both [[Jesus]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] are said to have visited it, too (see ''[[#Biblical Sidon|Biblical Sidon]]'' below). The city was eventually conquered by the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arabs]] and then by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Gwiazda |first1=Mariusz |last2=PiƒÖtkowska-Ma≈Çecka |first2=Joanna |last3=Wicenciak |first3=Urszula |last4=Makowski |first4=Piotr |last5=Bara≈Ñski |first5=Tomasz |date=2021-05-01 |title=The Sidon's/·π¢aydƒÅ Northern Hinterland during the Early Byzantine‚ÄìEarly Islamic Transition |url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/712931 |journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research |language=en |volume=385 |pages=171‚Äì200 |doi=10.1086/712931 |issn=0003-097X}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite journal |last1=Breen |first1=Colin |last2=Forsythe |first2=Wes |last3=O‚ÄôConnor |first3=Marianne |last4=Westley |first4=Kieran |date=2014 |title=The Mamluk/ Ottoman-period Maritime Cultural Landscape of Lebanon |url=https://honorfrostfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lebanon-Report-University-of-Ulster-May-2014.pdf |journal=Centre for Maritime Archaeology |pages=20‚Äì36}}</ref>

===Prehistory===
Sidon has been inhabited since very early in prehistory. The archaeological site of Sidon II shows a [[Stone tool|lithic]] [[Assemblage (archaeology)|assemblage]] dating to the [[Acheulean]], whilst finds at Sidon III include a [[Heavy Neolithic]] assemblage suggested to date just prior to the invention of [[pottery]].<ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"/>

===Late Bronze===
Around 1350 BC, Sidon was part of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Egyptian Empire]] and ruled by [[Zimredda of Sidon]]. During the Amarna Period, Egypt went into decline, leading to uprising and turmoil in the Levant. There was rivalry between Lebanese coastal city-states fighting for dominance, with [[Abimilki|Abimilku of Tyre]] in the south, and [[Rib-Hadda|Rib-Hadda of Byblos]] in the north. Byblos became significantly weakened as the dominant city on the Lebanese coast. Further north, the Akkar Plain rebelled and became the [[Amurru kingdom|kingdom of Amurru]] with Hittite support. The Mitanni Empire, an ally of the Egyptians, had dominated Syria but now fell apart due to the military campaigns of [[≈†uppiluliuma I|Suppiluliuma I of Hatti]]. Tutankhamun and his general Horemheb scrambled to keep Egyptian control over southern Levant, as the Hittites became overlords in the north.

The oldest testimony documenting words in the [[Phoenician language]] of Sidon, is also from this period. The Book of Deuteronomy (3, 9) reads: "the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion". In other words: [[Mount Hermon]] was called "Sirion", in (the Phoenician language of) Sidon.

===Iron Age===

Sidon was one of the most important [[Phoenicia]]n cities, and it may have been the oldest. From there and other ports, a great Mediterranean commercial empire was founded. [[Homer]] praised the skill of its craftsmen in producing glass, purple dyes, and its women's skill at the art of embroidery. It was also from here that a colonising party went to found the city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. Tyre also grew into a great city, and in subsequent years there was competition between the two, each claiming to be the metropolis ('Mother City') of [[Phoenicia]].

During the Phoenician era, Sidon thrived on two pivotal industries: glass manufacturing and [[Tyrian purple|purple dye]] production. The city's glass production operated on an extensive scale, while the manufacturing of purple dye held nearly equal importance.<ref name=":1">{{cite book |last=Jacoby |first=David |title=Trade, Commodities, and Shipping in the Medieval Mediterranean |year=1997 |at=pp.&nbsp;455&nbsp;ff and notes&nbsp;[17]‚Äì[19] |article=Silk in Western Byzantium before the Fourth Crusade}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{cite book |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1991 |isbn=0-195-04652-8 |location=New York, NY & Oxford, UK |page=1701 |article=Porphyrogennetos}}</ref> The magnitude of Sidon's purple dye production was evident through a considerable mound of discarded ''[[Murex trunculus]]'' shells discovered near the southern harbor.<ref name=":02" /> These shells were broken to extract the precious pigment, so rare that it became synonymous with royalty.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

In AD 1855, the sarcophagus of King [[Eshmunazar II|Eshmun‚Äôazar]] II was discovered. From a Phoenician inscription on its lid, it appears that he was a "king of the Sidonians," probably in the 5th century BC, and that his mother was a priestess of [[Astarte|‚ÄòAshtart]], "the goddess of the Sidonians."<ref>Thomas Kelly, Herodotus and the Chronology of the Kings of Sidon, [[Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research]], no. 268, pp. 39‚Äì56, 1987</ref> In this inscription the gods [[Eshmun]] and [[Baal|Ba‚Äòal]] Sidon 'Lord of Sidon' (who may or may not be the same) are mentioned as chief gods of the Sidonians. ‚ÄòAshtart is entitled ''‚ÄòAshtart-Shem-Ba‚Äòal,'' '‚ÄòAshtart the name of the Lord', a title also found in an [[Ugaritic]] text.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sugimoto |first=David T. |date=2014 |title=Transformation of a Goddess |url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/520f9c9be4b0210b06eba019/t/6078ad41f497d45a67b1c316/1618521411692/Transformation+of+a+goddess-astarte.pdf}}</ref>

[[Nebuchadnezzar II]] subjugated the city to be part of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]].{{sfn|Tucker|2019|p=876}} Sidon's navy played a significant role in the [[Battle of Salamis]] in 480 BC, aligning with the Persian fleet against the Greeks. From the mid-fifth century BC onward, warships became a prominent feature on the city's coinage.<ref name=":02">{{Cite book |last=Gates |first=Charles |title=Ancient cities: the archaeology of urban life in the ancient Near East and Egypt, Greece and Rome |date=2011 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-203-83057-4 |edition=2nd |location=London |pages=197, 190, 191}}</ref> At the end of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] era, in 351 BC, Phoenicia was invaded by [[Artaxerxes III]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |last=Waldemar |first=Heckel |title=Who's Who in the Age of Alexander the Great |date=2008 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=9781405154697 |pages=172}}</ref>

===Persian and Hellenistic periods===
[[File:Arch√§ologisches Museum Istanbul 2013-03-18y.jpg|thumb|Tomb of the Mourning Women, Hellenistic [[necropolis]] of Sidon, now in the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]]]]
Like other Phoenician city-states, Sidon suffered from a succession of conquerors, first by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in the 6th century BC, ending with its occupation by [[Alexander the Great]] in 333 BC, and the start of the [[Hellenistic period]] of Sidon's history.<ref name=":3" /> The Persian influence seems to have been profound, as is observed in the change of the architectural style of the city. 
In exchange for supporting his conquest of [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Egypt]], King [[Cambyses II]] of Persia awarded Sidon with the territories of [[Tel Dor|Dor]], [[Jaffa|Joppa]], and the [[Sharon Plain|Plain of Sharon]].{{efn|[[Sarcophagus of Eshmunazar II|See lines 18‚Äì20 of the Eshmunazar II sarchophagus inscription.]]}}{{efn|The territories of the Phoenician cities could be discontiguous: thus, the lands and the cities of Dor and Joppa belonging to the Sidonians were separated from Sidon by the city of Tyre.{{sfn|Elayi|1997|p=66}}}}{{Sfn|Briant|2002|p=490}}

Under the [[Diadochi]] or successors of Alexander, it enjoyed relative autonomy and organised games and competitions in which the greatest athletes of the region participated. In the Hellenistic period [[necropolis]] of Sidon, important finds such as the [[Alexander Sarcophagus]] (likely the tomb of King [[Abdalonymus]] rather than Alexander<ref name=":02" />), the [[Lycia]]n tomb and the Sarcophagus of the Crying Women were discovered, which are now on display at the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum|Archaeological Museum]] of [[Istanbul]].<ref name="Turkey">{{Cite news |url= http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/turkey/istanbul/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154654614207 |title= Istanbul Archaeology Museum |access-date= 10 May 2008 |newspaper= The New York Times |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://archive.today/20120524104810/http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/turkey/istanbul/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154654614207 |archive-date= 24 May 2012 }}</ref>

The Romans built a theater and other major monuments in the city, and [[Sidon Mithraeum|an underground Mithraeum]] was discovered. In the reign of [[Elagabalus]], a [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman colony]] was established there. During the [[Byzantine Empire]], when the [[551 Beirut earthquake|great earthquake of AD 551]] destroyed most of the cities of [[Phoenice (Roman province)|Phoenice]], the [[law school of Berytus]] took refuge in Sidon. The town continued quietly for the next century, until the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant]] in 636.<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":4" />

===Crusader-Ayyubid period===
[[File:SidonSeaCastle.jpg|thumb|[[Sidon Sea Castle]], built by the [[Crusader states|Crusaders]] in AD 1228]]
On 4 December 1110, Sidon was captured after the [[siege of Sidon]], a decade after the [[First Crusade]], by King [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]] and King [[Sigurd I of Norway]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=A History of the Crusades, Vol. II: The Kingdom of Jeru‚Ä¶ |url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/428520.A_History_of_the_Crusades_Vol_II |access-date=2024-05-28 |website=Goodreads |language=en}}</ref> It then became the center of the [[Lordship of Sidon]], an important vassal-state of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. [[Saladin]] captured it from the Crusaders in 1187, but German Crusaders restored it to Christian control in the [[Crusade of 1197]]. It remained an important Crusader stronghold until it was destroyed by the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubids]] in 1249.

During the 12th century, [[Benjamin of Tudela]] noted the presence of approximately twenty Jews, possibly families, in Sidon, which he described as a "large city."<ref name=":03" />

===Ottoman period===
After Sidon came under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkish]] rule in the early 16th century, it became the capital of the [[Sidon Eyalet]] (province) and regained a great deal of its earlier commercial importance.<ref name=":0" /> In 1521, [[Moses ben Mordecai Bassola|Moses Basola]] encountered twenty families of [[Musta'arabi Jews|Musta'rabi Jews]] during his visit to Sidon.<ref name=":03" />

During the 18th century, the city was dominated by the Hammud family of notables, who monopolized the production and exporting of cotton in the region and built numerous palaces and public works in the city. The Hammuds also served as government customs agents and tax collectors for various Ottoman religious foundations.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal |last1=Winter |first1=Stefan |url=https://www.academia.edu/44396298 |title=Sa√Øda √† l'√©poque des agha-s: la famille Hammud et l'√âtat ottoman au XVIIIe si√®cle |journal=Archivum Ottomanicum |date=2020 |volume=37 |pages=219‚Äì242 |access-date=8 March 2022 |archive-date=13 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230213161506/https://www.academia.edu/44396298 |url-status=live }}</ref>

During the [[Egyptian‚ÄìOttoman War (1839‚Äì41)|Egyptian‚ÄìOttoman War]], Sidon, like much of [[Ottoman Syria]], was occupied by the forces of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]]. His ambitions were opposed by the British Empire, which backed the Ottomans. The [[British Empire|British]] Admiral [[Charles Napier (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Napier]], commanding a mixed squadron of British, Turkish and Austrian ships, bombarded Sidon on 26 September 1840, and landed with a column. Sidon capitulated in two days, and the British went on to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. This action was recalled in two Royal Navy vessels being named {{HMS|Sidon}}.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Colledge |first1=James Joseph |title=Ships of the Royal Navy: the complete record of all fighting ships of the Royal Navy from the 15th century to the present |last2=Warlow |first2=Ben |date=2006 |publisher=Chatham Publ |isbn=978-1-86176-281-8 |edition=New rev. |location=London}}</ref>

The 19th century brought significant changes to the Jewish community of Sidon. By 1830, the community, comprising around twenty-five families of primarily Arabic-speaking merchants, had customs akin to those of [[Old Yishuv|Judean Jews]]. Starting in 1850, the community witnessed growth as [[Maghrebi Jews]], initially settled in the [[Chouf District|Chouf Mountains]] above Beirut, migrated to Sidon and [[Beirut]] amidst escalating [[Druze]]-[[Maronites|Maronite]] tensions and the ensuing 1860 war. With roots in mountain traditions, they introduced citrus cultivation on the outskirts of Sidon, leading to the construction of a new [[synagogue]] in 1860 to meet the needs of the expanding community.<ref name=":03" />

From 1887 the [[Royal necropolis of Ayaa|Royal necropolis of Sidon]] was extensively excavated by the Ottomans, and its treasures transferred to [[Istanbul]] (like the [[Alexander sarcophagus]]). Sidon was a small fishing town of 10,000 inhabitants in 1900.

The refugee camps constituted de facto neighborhoods of Sidon, but had a separate legal and political status which made them into a kind of enclaves. At the same time, the remaining Jews of the city fled, and the Jewish cemetery fell into disrepair, threatened by coastal erosion.

On [[Easter Sunday#Eastern Christianity|Easter Sunday]], 19 April 1981, at least sixteen people were killed in Sidon after the ([[South Lebanon Army]]) SLA's long-range artillery indiscriminately shelled the city centre. It was reported that it was in response to a request from [[Bashir Gemayel]] in connection with ongoing Syrian attacks on [[Lebanese Forces|Phalangist]] positions around [[Zahle]]. Israel denied involvement.<ref>[[Middle East International]] No 149, 8 May 1981; Publishers [[Christopher Mayhew|Lord Mayhew]], [[Dennis Walters|Dennis Walters MP]], Editor [[Michael Adams (journalist)|Michael Adams]]; [[John Bulloch (journalist)|John Bulloch]] pp.6-7.

On 18 August 1997, following a roadside bomb near [[Jezzine]] which killed two teenage members of a [[South Lebanon Army|SLA]] leader's family, SLA artillery shelled Sidon killing seven civilians and wounding thirty-five. [[Hizbollah]] responded the following day by firing 60‚Äì80 rockets into the [[Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon|security zone]] and northern Israel. According to [[UNIFIL]] observers the missiles appeared to be targeted at uninhabited areas. The attack on Sidon is credited with leading to a truce between Hizbollah and [[Amal Militia|Amal]] and increased cooperation between the two groups and the [[Lebanese Army]]. This was evident in the [[Ansariya ambush]] the following month.<ref>Middle East International No 557, 29 August 1997; Michael Jansen, pp. 3-7. No 558. 12 September 1997.</ref>

On 8 June 1999 two gunmen entered the Palais de Justice, Sidon's main courthouse, and shot dead three magistrates and a chief prosecutor. The attackers escaped. No group claimed responsibility but suspicion focused on [[Osbat al-Ansar]] whose leader had been sentenced to death ''in absentia'' for the murder of the head of the [[Sufi]] [[Al-Ahbash]] movement and the attempted assassination of the [[mufti]] of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]]. He was believed to be in hiding in the [[Ain al-Hilwa]] refugee camp.<ref>Middle East International No 602, 18 June 1999; Jim Quilty p.9</ref>

Studies in 2000 showed a population of 65,000 in the city, and around 200,000 in the metropolitan area. The little level land around the city is used for cultivation of wheat, vegetables, and fruits, especially citrus and bananas. The fishing in the city remains active with a newly opened fishery that sells fresh fish by bidding every morning. The ancient basin was transformed into a fishing port, while a small quay was constructed to receive small commercial vessels (see "Old City" and the "Architecture and landscape" sections below).

==Politics==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2023}}
[[File:ZiddonPt1982b.jpg|thumb|Israeli soldiers in the port of Sidon, June 1982]]
This sectarian and demographic division rose to the surface during the [[Lebanese Civil War]], when armed clashes erupted between Sunni Muslims and Christians. The clashes ended with the surrender of the Christian front, and Christians were forced to move to east [[Beirut]]. After the war ended in 1990, some Christians gradually returned to their hometowns but in 2000 many fled to Israel. The local politics of Sidon in the 20th century was mainly dominated up till the 1980s by allegiances around two main families, the [[El-Bizri]] and Saad. The El-Bizri politicians were known for their business connections, close ties with eminent Lebanese and Levantine leaders, and their bent on serving the Lebanese state as government ministers, officials and mayors. The Saad politicians tended to be populist and became engaged in violent protests in the 1940s, 1950s and then during the Lebanese civil war as Nasserites (populist followers of [[Nasser]] in Lebanon).

The local political conflict between these two families was always resolved through amicable means and ties of kinship. Their hold over the political aspects of the city was similar to that of Mediterranean families in Sicily or to being also influenced by the ties of Arab families, clans, and tribes in traditionalist forms. The most notable figures of the El-Bizri family in the first half of the 20th century were: Ahmad El-Bizri (born 1899), Salah El-Bizri, Eizeddine El-Bizri (commonly known as Eizzo) and Anwar El-Bizri (born 1910). These four brothers were businessmen and politicians who dominated the political life of the city up till the late 1940s, using traditional inherited forms of governance since Ottoman times. With intelligence and strength they maintained their power for over 50 years. It is from their ranks that [[Maarouf Saad]] started his public life, and their close cousins, Nazih El-Bizri, Amin El-Bizri, and Fouad El-Bizri became the next generation of politicians and statesmen in Lebanon; holding positions as ministers and members of parliament.

The El-Bizri and the Saad political practices were bent on social justice and on local service in public affairs. The El-Bizri were since the Ottoman rule bent on serving the state, and this continued with their loyalty and support to the successive governments of Lebanon since the times of independence. They also helped eminent politicians and statesmen from Sidonian descent such as the Prime Ministers [[Riad Solh]], [[Takieddine el-Solh]] and Rashid Solh, they also gave their support to former Prime Minister [[Saeb Salam]], father of [[Tamam Salam]], Prime Minister 2014‚Äì2016. The presence of the El-Bizris was at times intimidating on the local scene, but they were also known for their goodwill and dignified public service.

The Saad family developed their links with Nasserism in the 1950s and engaged in the uprising and armed protest of 1958 against the government of the Lebanese President Chamoun. They also became involved in the civil war as part of the left wing politics of the Lebanon (Al-Haraka al-Wataniyya) with PLO connections, and they actively contributed to resisting the Israeli occupation after 1982. The Saads remained populist in their politics and focused on the grassroots, while the El-Bizri were generally appealing to the middle and upper classes. In the middle 1980s, the Hariri family began to rise to prominence and became the most influential in Sidon in political and financial terms, even though the presence of the Saad and the El-Bizri in local politics remained significant at the level of visibility and activism. The Saad family developed its original politics from within the sphere of influence of the El-Bizri family and then became a power to reckon with on its own after 1948, and most powerfully in 1958, then in the civil war and until the present today.

Maarouf Saad, the leader of his family, and a local influential politician, was assassinated at the eve of the Lebanese civil war in 1975. The Saads retained their populism and grassroots appeal, and attracted a core of loyal adherents since the middle of the 20th century. While the El-Bizri were Levantine in their Arabism (namely focused mainly on Bilad al-Shaam in regional politics), and the Solh being also similar to them in this, the Saad were leaning more towards a broader pan-Arabism (Nasserite, Libyan, and then Syrian). The Hariri family started to rise to political and economic prominence in the 1980s and became perhaps the most influential family in Lebanon by the mid-1990s, following modern forms of political practice through a large party (Future Movement) that cuts across various economic classes.

==Impact on Sidon of regional underdevelopment==
According to a 2013 [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) report "data also point to an increase in urban poverty especially in Lebanon's largest cities suburbs such as Beirut, Tripoli and Saida, as illustrated by poverty-driven symptoms (child labour, over-crowding and deteriorated environment conditions)."<ref>[http://www.undp.org.lb/WhatWeDo/poverty.cfm Poverty] undp.org {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105032823/http://www.undp.org.lb/WhatWeDo/poverty.cfm |date=5 November 2013 }}</ref> In another UNDP report, the author discusses the development predominance of Beirut over the rest of the regions of Lebanon (North, South and Beqaa) is a well-known imbalance that can be dated to the early 19th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.undp.org.lb/communication/publications/linking/Session4.pdf |title=Towards a Regionally Balance Development |publisher=Undp.org.lb |access-date=2015-03-16 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074006/http://www.undp.org.lb/communication/publications/linking/Session4.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> With the expansion of Beirut in the 1870s, urban growth in the future capital outpaced Tripoli and Saida. Transportation routes, missionary schools, universities and hospitals as well as the Beirut port development and the commerce of silk participated to the fortification of Beirut as a major trade center for Mediterranean exchange (ARNAUD 1993; LABAKI 1999: 23). However, the establishment of Great Lebanon in 1920, under the French mandate, added the poorer areas of the North (Akkar), Beqaa (Baalbak-Hermel) and the South (Jabal Aamel) to the relatively affluent cities of Mount Lebanon. This addition made of Lebanon a country composed of unequally developed regions. This legacy remains a heavy load to bear socially, culturally, economically and politically. Even though the public policies elaborated by the young Lebanese State were attempting to have regional perspectives, the early urban planning schemes reveal a development approach exclusively axed{{dubious|date=June 2023}} on Beirut and its suburbs.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

The post war development policy of the State, promoted by Hariri government (1992‚Äì1998), was centered around balanced development and is widely inspired by the 1943 Pact and the 1989 Taef agreement (LABAKI1993: 104). However the application of this policy aims mainly at the rehabilitation and construction of roads and infrastructures (electricity, telephone, sewage). Another of its components is the rehabilitation of government buildings (airport, port, schools, universities and hospitals). Transportation projects (mainly concentrated on the coastal line) constitute 25% of the budget of 10-year economic plan developed by the CDR (BAALBAKI 1994: 90). However, all these projects are predominantly concentrated around Beirut, ignoring the regions.

===The former ''Makab'' (waste dump) and the treatment plant ===
Near the southern entrance to the city used to be a 'rubbish mountain' called at the time by the locals the ''Makab''; namely, a 600,000 cubic metre heap that reached the height of a four-story building. It was originally created to dispose of the remains of buildings destroyed in Israeli air strikes during the 1982 invasion, but it then became the main dump for the city. Growing out of the sea, it became an environmental hazard, with [[medical waste]] and plastic bags polluting nearby fishing grounds.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Sidon politicians, including the Hariri family, failed for decades to resolve the ''Makab'' crisis‚Äîwhich has endangered residents' health (especially during episodic burning). In 2004, Engineer Hamzi Moghrabi, a Sidon native, conceived the idea to establish a treatment plant for the city's decades-old chronic waste problem. He established the privately funded IBC Enviro and the treatment plant became operational in 2013.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Chami |first=Hanadi |date=4 October 2012 |title=Saida to get rid of trash mountain |url=http://www.businessnews.com.lb/cms/Story/StoryDetails/2189/Saida-to-get-rid-of-trash-mountain |access-date=17 September 2023 |website=Lebanon Opportunities |language=en-US}}</ref>

The Ministry of Environment came up with a $50,000+ plan to clean the whole area and transform the dump into a green space, along with other heaps in the country. Qamla beach in Sidon, a coast in close proximity to the Sea Castle, witnessed a large municipal cleanup in May 2011, as it was an easy target of rubbish being washed up by the Makab. These plans aim to revive the former glory of the city's coasts and attract tourists who avoided swimming in Sidon's sea before. The project of cleaning the region where the waste dump has already started, and currently a waves-barrier is being built, and the vast bulk of the waste dump being cleared.<ref>{{cite news |last=Antelava |first=Natalia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8426091.stm |title=Lebanese city's mountain of rubbish |work=BBC News |date=2009-12-25 |access-date=2015-03-16 |archive-date=15 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615032531/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8426091.stm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business24-7.ae/Articles/2009/11/Pages/24112009/11252009_73db570b8298406b974037f9b3a23bbb.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127204925/http://www.business24-7.ae/Articles/2009/11/Pages/24112009/11252009_73db570b8298406b974037f9b3a23bbb.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=27 November 2009|title=Mountain of rubbish overwhelms Sidon|work=Emirates 24/7|access-date=15 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iloubnan.info/environment/actualite/id/37182/titre/Sidon-chokes-under-rubbish-dump|title=Sidon chokes under rubbish dump|access-date=15 September 2014|archive-date=2 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402141156/http://www.iloubnan.info/environment/actualite/id/37182/titre/Sidon-chokes-under-rubbish-dump|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&categ_id=1&article_id=108602|title=Syringes plague Sidon beach as dump spills medical waste|work=The Daily Star Newspaper - Lebanon|access-date=15 September 2014}}</ref>

==Local government==
The city of Sidon is administered by the Municipality of Sidon. The municipality is constituted of a council of 21 members including the City Mayor and his Deputy. It has administrative and financial independence but remains under the control and supervision of the central government, specifically the Ministry of Interior. The municipality's jurisdiction is limited to a region of 786 hectares in area and 5 meters in elevation, while each of the city's suburbs is administered by its own independent municipal council. Sidon is the center of the [[Governorate of South Lebanon]], and hosts the seat of the Governor of Southern Lebanon. The city is also the center of the Sidon District and the Union of Sidon and Zahrani Municipalities (founded in 1978 and contains 15 municipalities). Sidon hosts the southern regional headquarters of a series of governmental facilities like the Central Bank of Lebanon, √âlectricit√© du Liban, Central Telecommunications Station and others. It is also the home of the Justice Palace of South Lebanon in its new headquarters on East Boulevard (the old headquarters were an old [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Saray (building)|Saray]] that is currently occupied by the LSF and is planned to be transformed into a cultural center by the municipality).{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In the 2000 and 2005 parliamentary elections, the Sidon District along with the [[Tyre District|Tyre]] and [[Bint Jbeil]] districts formed the first electoral district of South Lebanon. However, in the 2009 elections ‚Äì and due to the reactivation of the 1960 electoral law ‚Äì the city of Sidon was separated from its district to form a separate electoral district.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Demographics==
The overwhelming majority of Sidon's population belong to the Sunni sect of Islam, with a small number of Shiites and Christians. Sidon is the seat of the Greek Melkite Catholic Archbishop of Sidon and [[Deir el Qamar]], and has housed a significant Catholic population throughout its history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dsadm.html|title=Sa√ØdƒÅ (Sidone) (Maronite Eparchy) [Catholic-Hierarchy]|website=www.catholic-hierarchy.org|access-date=2019-03-28|archive-date=29 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329002456/http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dsadm.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Sidon also hosts the seat of the [[Shi'a Islam in Lebanon|Shiite]] [[Ayatollah]] of South Lebanon.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In the 1930s, when Lebanon was still under the French mandate, Sidon had the largest [[History of the Jews in Lebanon|Jewish]] population in Lebanon, estimated at 3,588, compared to 3,060 in [[Beirut]].<ref>Simon, Reeva S., Michael M.

* The British War Cemetery in Sidon. Opened in 1943 by units of His Majesty's (King George VI) British Forces occupying the Lebanon after the 1941 campaign against the Vichy French troops. It was originally used for the burial of men who died while serving with the occupation force, but subsequently the graves of a number of the casualties of the 1941 campaign were moved into the cemetery from other burial grounds or from isolated positions in the vicinity. The cemetery now contains 176 Commonwealth burials of the Second World War and nine war graves of other nationalities. It was designed by G. Vey. It is perhaps that only garden in modern Sidon that is elegantly kept and cared for.

==Archaeology==
The following archaeological sites in the area indicate settlements from the earliest prehistorical times.

'''Sidon I''' is an [[archaeological]] site located to the east of the city, south of the road to [[Jezzine]]. An assemblage of [[flint]] tools was found by P. E. Gigues suggested to date between 3800 and 3200 BC. The collection included narrow [[axe]]s or [[chisel]]s that were polished on one side and flaked on the other, similar to ones found at Ain Cheikh, Nahr Zahrani and Gelal en Namous.<ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"/> The collection appears to have gone missing from the [[Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut]].<ref>Gigues, P. E. (1937‚Äì1938), "L√©b√©'a, Kafer-Garra, Qray√©: n√©cropoles de la r√©gion sidonienne". ''BMB (Bulletin du Mus√©e de Beyrouth)'', vol. 1, pp. 35‚Äì76, vol. 2, pp. 30‚Äì72, vol. 3, pp. 54‚Äì63.</ref>

'''Sidon II''' is said to be "near the church" at approximately fifty meters [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. P. E. Gigues suggested that the industry found on the surface of this site dated to the [[Acheulean]].<ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"/>

'''Sidon III''' was found by E. Passemard in the 1920s, who made a collection of material that is now in the [[National Museum of Beirut]] marked "Camp de l'Aviation". It includes large [[flint]] and [[chert]] bifacials that may be of [[Heavy Neolithic]] origin.<ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"/>

'''Sidon IV''' is the [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] mound of ancient Sidon with Early [[Bronze Age]] ({{Circa|3200 BC}}) deposits, now located underneath the ruined [[Saint Louis Castle]] and what are also thought to be the ruins of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] theater.<ref name="CopelandWescombe1965">{{cite book|author1=Lorraine Copeland|author2=P.

===Bronze Age Sidon===
In the area of this ruined Crusader castle, recent excavations uncovered a late Early Bronze Age I (EB I) settlement on bedrock. Here, an uninterrupted sequence from EB I to EB III was found. A modest third-millennium BC settlement consisting of domestic installations and tombs was also uncovered.<ref>Doumet-Serhal, C. 2006. "The Early Bronze Age in Sidon: 'College Site' Excavations (1998‚Äì2000‚Äì2001)". ''Biblioth√®que archeologique et historique'' 178.

''Near Eastern Archaeology'', 73:114‚Äì129.</ref> Yet the following history of Sidon was not clarified. Very little has been known about the location, extent, and significance of Middle Bronze Age (MBA) Sidon until recently.<ref name=":5" />

Since the early 21st century, [[Tell el-Burak]] excavations have helped significantly in this area, because it was an active settlement during MBA, and quite well preserved. Tell el-Burak is located along the coast 9 km south from Sidon. Previously, there was a big gap in the history of this whole coastal area from the end of the [[Early Bronze Age]] until the middle of the 2nd millennium BC, when Sidon is first mentioned in the historical texts.<ref name="auto">{{cite journal |first1=H√©l√®ne |last1=Sader |first2=Jens |last2=Kamlah |date=2010 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261732734 |title=Tell el-Burak: A New Middle Bronze Age Site from Lebanon |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211110025908/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261732734_Tell_el-Burak_A_new_Middle_Bronze_Age_Site_from_Lebanon |archive-date=10 November 2021 |journal=Near Eastern Archaeology |volume=73 |issue=2/3 |pages=130‚Äì141 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |doi=10.1086/NEA25754042 |via=ResearchGate }}</ref>

Archaeologists determined that Sidon was clearly the big power centre during MBA, controlling significant territory. So there appears to have been the "Kingdom of Sidon" that controlled el-Burak, and many other surrounding areas.<ref name="auto"/>

=== Excavation history ===
The area around Sidon contains a number of important necropoli (below in order of age, and noting their principal excavators):<ref>Nina Jid√©jian, [http://www.ahlebanon.com/images/PDF/Issue%2010%20-%20The%20Millenium%20Edition/Greater%20Sidon%20and%20its%20Cities%20Of%20The%20Dead%20-%20Nina%20Jidejian.pdf "Greater Sidon and its 'Cities of the Dead{{'"}}], ''National Museum News'', page 24. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210125093459/http://www.ahlebanon.com/images/PDF/Issue%2010%20-%20The%20Millenium%20Edition/Greater%20Sidon%20and%20its%20Cities%20Of%20The%20Dead%20-%20Nina%20Jidejian.pdf |date=25 January 2021 }}.</ref>

In indication of the high-profile of the old city of Sidon in archaeological expeditions, and mainly in the 19th century, in October 1860 the famous French scholar [[Ernest Renan]] was entrusted with an archaeological mission to Lebanon, which included the search for the antique parts of Sidon. The Phoenician inscriptions that he discovered, and his field data, were eventually published in his notebook the: ''Mission de Ph√©nicie'' (1864‚Äì1874; ''Phoenician Expedition'').

The [[Saint Louis Castle|St. Louis castle]] grounds were excavated in 1914‚Äì1920 by a French team.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sidon Excavation {{!}} Sidon Excavation |url=https://www.sidonexcavation.com/ |access-date=2024-05-28 |language=en}}</ref> Then eastwards a new site was also excavated by another generation of French expeditions in the 1960s. This same site received renewed attention in 1998 when the [[Directorate General of Antiquities]] in Lebanon authorized the [[British Museum]] to begin excavations on this area of land that was specifically demarcated for archaeological research. This has resulted in published papers, with a special focus on studying ceramics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sidonexcavation.org/ht_d_pre/ht_d_pre1.html |title=Previous Excavation |publisher=SidonExcavation |access-date=26 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020419074213/http://www.sidonexcavation.org/ht_d_pre/ht_d_pre1.html |archive-date=19 April 2002}}</ref>

The archaeological fieldwork was not fully undertaken since the independence of the Lebanon. The main finds are displayed in the [[National Museum of Beirut|National Museum in Beirut]]. The fieldwork was also interrupted during the long civil war period, and it is now resumed but at a timid and slow scale, and not involving major international expeditions or expertise. Perhaps this is also indicative of the general lack in cultural interests among the authorities of this city, and almost of the non-existence of notable intellectual activities in its modern life. There are signs that the locals are beginning to recognize the value of the medieval quarters, but this remains linked to minor individual initiatives and not a coordinated collective effort to rehabilitate it like it has been the case with [[Byblos]], even though the old district of Sidon contains a great wealth in old and ancient architecture.

==Biblical Sidon==
[[File:Shrinepeter.jpg|thumb|Shrine commemorating the last meeting place between [[St. Paul]] and [[St. Peter]] inside the Old City of Sidon]]

===Hebrew Bible/Old Testament===
The [[Hebrew Bible]] describes Sidon ({{Script/Hebrew|◊¶÷¥◊ô◊ì◊ï÷π◊ü|Tsƒ´d≈çn}}) in several passages:
* It received its name from the "first-born" of [[Canaan (Biblical figure)|Canaan]], the grandson of [[Noah]] ({{bibleverse|Genesis|10:15}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Genesis|19}}).
* The [[Tribe of Zebulun]] has a frontier on Sidon<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Klein |first=Reuven Chaim (Rudolph) |date=April 2018 |title=Nations and Super-Nations of Canaan |url=https://tobias-lib.ub.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10900/148214/jbq_462_kleincanaan.pdf |journal=Jewish Bible Quarterly | issn=0792-3910 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=84}} cites [[Rashi]] and [[David Kimhi|Radak]] as reading that verse as saying that the city of Sidon itself was not said to be part of Zebulun's territory, while the  medieval exgete [[Eleazar of Worms|Elazar Rokeach]] understood that it was.</ref>  ({{bibleverse|Genesis|49:13}})
* It was the first home of the [[Phoenicia]]ns on the coast of Canaan, and from its extensive commercial relations became a "great" city ({{bibleverse|Joshua|11:8}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Joshua|19:28}}).
* It was the mother city of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]]. It lay within the lot of the tribe of Asher, but was never subdued ({{bibleverse|Judges|1:31}}).
* The Sidonians long oppressed [[Israelites|Israel]] ({{bibleverse|Judges|10:12}}).
* From the time of [[David]] its glory began to wane, and [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], its "virgin daughter" ({{bibleverse|Isaiah|23:12}}), rose to its place of pre-eminence.
* [[Solomon]] entered into a matrimonial alliance with the Sidonians, and thus their form of idolatrous worship found a place in the [[land of Israel]] ({{bibleverse|1 Kings|11:1}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1 Kings|33}}).
* [[Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel]] was the daughter of King [[Ithobaal I]] of Sidon ({{bibleverse|1 Kings|16:31}}).
* It was famous for its manufactures and arts, as well as for its commerce ({{bibleverse|1 Kings|5:6}}; {{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|22:4}}; {{bibleverse|Ezekiel|27:8}}).
* It is frequently referred to by the prophets ({{bibleverse|Isaiah|23:2}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Isaiah|4}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Isaiah|12}}; {{bibleverse|Jeremiah|25:22}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Jeremiah|27:3}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Jeremiah|47:4}}; {{bibleverse|Ezekiel|27:8}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Ezekiel|28:21}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Ezekiel|22}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Ezekiel|32:30}}; {{bibleverse|Joel|3:4}}).
* [[Elijah]] sojourned in Sidon, performing miracles ({{bibleverse|1 Kings|17:9‚Äì24}}; see also in the New Testament, {{bibleverse|Luke|4:26}}).

===New Testament===
* Jesus visited the region or "coasts" ([[King James Version]]) of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] and Sidon ({{bibleverse|Matthew|15:21}}; {{bibleverse|Mark|7:24}}) and from this region many came forth to hear him preaching ({{bibleverse|Mark|3:8}}; {{bibleverse|Luke|6:17}}), leading to the stark contrast in {{bibleverse|Matthew|11:21‚Äì23}} to [[Korazin]] and [[Bethsaida]]. See the [[exorcism of the Syrophoenician woman's daughter]], which takes place on the coast, in the region of Sidon and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. Then he returned from the region of Tyre, and went by way of Sidon towards the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the Decapolis ({{bibleverse|Mark|7:31}})
* From Sidon, at which his ship put in after leaving [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]], [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] finally sailed for Rome ({{bibleverse|Acts|27:3}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|4}}).

==Sanchuniathon==
* The account ascribed to the Phoenician historian [[Sanchuniathon]] makes Sidon a daughter of Pontus, son of [[Nereus]]. She is said there to have first invented musical song from the sweetness of her voice.
