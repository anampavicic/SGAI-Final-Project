'''Patras''' ({{langx|el|Πάτρα|Pátra}} {{IPA-el|ˈpatra|pron|Patra - Πάτρα.ogg}}; [[Katharevousa]] and {{langx|grc|Πάτραι}};{{Efn|<small>romanized:</small> {{Lang|grc-Latn|Pátrai}}, {{IPA|grc|pátrai̯|lang|link=yes}}, <small>Katharevousa:</small> {{IPA-el|ˈpatre|}}|name=|group=lower-alpha}} {{langx|la|Patrae}}{{Efn|{{IPA|la|ˈpatrae̯|}}|name=|group=lower-alpha}}) is [[Greece]]'s [[List of cities in Greece|third-largest city]] and the regional capital and largest city of [[Western Greece]], in the northern [[Peloponnese]], {{convert|215|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Athens]]. The city is built at the foot of Mount [[Panachaikon]], overlooking the [[Gulf of Patras]].

As of the 2021 census, the municipality of Patras has a population of 215,922, while the urban population is 173,600. The core settlement has a history spanning four millennia. In the Roman period, it had become a cosmopolitan center of the eastern Mediterranean whilst, according to the Christian tradition, it was also the place of [[Saint Andrew]]'s [[martyr]]dom.

Dubbed as Greece's '<nowiki/>''Gate to the West''', Patras is a commercial hub, while its busy port is a nodal point for trade and communication with Italy and the rest of [[Western Europe]]. The city has three public universities, hosting a large student population and rendering Patras an important scientific centre<ref>{{Cite web |last=S.L.U |first=Course Guru |title=Όλα τα 3 Πανεπιστήμια σε Πάτρα {{!}} Κατατάξεις & Αξιολογήσεις 2023 |url=https://www.universityguru.gr/panepistimia-patras |access-date=2023-06-14 |website=UniversityGuru |language=el |archive-date=14 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230614104156/https://www.universityguru.gr/panepistimia-patras |url-status=live }}</ref> with a field of excellence in technological education. The [[Rio-Antirrio Bridge]] connects Patras' easternmost suburb of Rio to the town of Antirrio, connecting the [[Peloponnese]] peninsula with mainland Greece.

Every year, in February, the city hosts one of Europe's largest carnivals. Notable features of the [[Patras Carnival]] include its mammoth satirical floats and balls and parades, enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of visitors in a [[Mediterranean climate]]. Patras is also famous for supporting an indigenous cultural scene active mainly in the performing arts and modern urban literature. It was [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/jan/29/greece.observerescapesection|title=Party town gets a culture kick|first=Paul|last=Mansfield|date=29 January 2006|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=6 September 2017|archive-date=18 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518214943/https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/jan/29/greece.observerescapesection|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
{{About|For the Ancient Greek, Roman and Byzantine history of Patras see: [[History of Patras]]}}
[[File:The recently restored Roman Odeon of Ancient Patrai, built before 160 AD, Patras, Greece (14244629163).jpg|thumb|View of the recently restored Roman Odeon (2015)|left]]

=== Middle Ages and early modern ===
{{See also|Byzantine Greece|Frankokratia|Principality of Achaea|Ottoman Greece|Kingdom of the Morea}}
[[File:Greece in 1278.svg|thumb|The Principality of Achaea in southern Greece, 1278|left]]
In 1205, the city was captured by [[William of Champlitte]] and [[Geoffrey I of Villehardouin|Villehardouin]], and became a part of the [[principality of Achaea]]. It became the seat of the [[Barony of Patras]], and its [[Latin Archbishop of Patras|Latin archbishop]] primate of the principality. In 1408, Patras became [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]], until it was recaptured in 1430 by the [[Despotate of Morea]] and its despot [[Constantine XI|Constantine Palaiologos]], who thus succeeded in recovering for the [[Byzantine Empire]] the whole of the [[Morea]], apart from Venetian possessions. The administration of Patras was given to [[George Sphrantzes]], while Constantine was immediately contested by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and later, in 1449, became emperor of the Byzantine empire.<ref>Patra. From antiquity until today, Kotinos A.E. Editions, Athens 2005</ref>

Patras remained a part of the [[Despotate of Morea]] until 1458, when it was conquered by the Sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Mehmet II]]. Under the Ottomans, it was known as "Baliabadra", from the {{Langx|el|Παλαιά Πάτρα}} ('Old Patras'), as opposed to {{Lang|el|Νέα Πάτρα}} ('new Patra'), the town of [[Ypati]] in [[Central Greece (geographic region)|Central Greece]]. Though Mehmet granted the city special privileges and tax reductions, it never became a major centre of commerce. [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] attacked and captured it several times in the 15th and 16th centuries, but never re-established their rule effectively, except for a period of [[Kingdom of the Morea|Venetian rule]] in 1687–1715 after the [[Morean War]].<ref>''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'' ''s.v.'' Baliabadra</ref>

It has been noted that during and in the aftermath of the suppressed 1770 [[Orlov revolt]] "when the Greeks got the upper hand they settled old scores; when the Turks and Albanians reasserted themselves they were merciless: recapturing Patras, they left scarcely anyone alive."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Constantine David |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bGGJDwAAQBAJ |title=In the Footsteps of the Gods: Travellers to Greece and the Quest for the Hellenic Ideal |publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks |year=2011 |isbn=9780857719478 |pages=169 |quote=Readers were thus enabled to follow and visualize the campaign as it was reported, almost daily but after a time-lag of about four weeks, in despatches from Italy and Turkey. They read accounts — as confused, contradictory, exaggerated or downright false as such accounts generally are — of the Sieges of Coron and Modon, of the taking and Ioss of Mistra, the rout at Tripolis and the victory off Tchesmé. And it was repeatedly noted that both sides were conducting the war with great savagery: ' the ravages committed by both armies ... are dreadful ... horrid cruelties perpetrated in cold blood, shocking to human nature, 'the war is carried on with much Bloodshed and Horror'. When the Greeks got the upper hand they settled old scores; when the Turks and Albanians reasserted themselves they were merciless: recapturing Patras, they left scarcely anyone alive.}}</ref>

In 1772, a [[Battle of Patras (1772)|naval battle]] took place off the city between the Russians and Ottomans.

=== Modern era ===
Patras was one of the first cities in which the [[Greek Revolution]] began in 1821;<ref>{{cite web|author=Strategus Makrygiannis|title="Memoirs", Book A, Chapter I, Athens, 1849|url=http://www.snhell.gr/testimonies/writer.asp?id=102|access-date=2012-10-02|archive-date=13 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713010850/http://www.snhell.gr/testimonies/writer.asp?id=102|url-status=live}}</ref>  the Ottoman garrison, confined to the citadel, [[Siege of Patras (1821)|held out]] until 1828. After the war, most of the city and its buildings were completely destroyed.

Patras developed quickly into the second-largest urban centre in late-19th-century Greece.<ref>Triantafyllou, Κ.Ν., ''Historic Lexicon of Patras''</ref> The city benefited from its role as the main export port for the agricultural produce of the Peloponnese.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kounenaki Pegy|title=19th Century Patras: how the character of the city changed with the development of the port after 1828|url=http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_civ_491371_14/10/2001_3252|publisher=News.kathimerini.gr|access-date=2012-10-02|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215003502/http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_civ_491371_14/10/2001_3252|archive-date=2012-02-15}}</ref>

In the early 20th century, Patras developed fast and became the first Greek city to introduce public streetlights and electrified tramways.<ref>Thomopoulos</ref> The war effort necessitated by the [[First World War]] hampered the city's development and also created uncontrollable [[urban sprawl]] after the influx of displaced persons from [[Asia Minor]] after the 1922 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]. In the Second World War, the city was a major target of Italian [[airstrike|air raids]]. In the Axis occupation period, a German military command was established and German and Italian troops stationed in the city. After the liberation in 1944, the city recovered, but in later years was increasingly overshadowed by the urban pole of Athens.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}} Since 2014, the city's mayor is [[Kostas Peletidis]].

== Urban landscape ==
The city is divided into the upper and the lower section, connected with roads and broad stairs. The upper section (''Ano Poli'') is the older and the more picturesque; however, the lower section (''Kato Poli'') is laid out according to the 1858 city plan{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}, featuring a variety of squares. The most notable of these are the ''Psila Alonia'' and the [[Georgiou I Square]]. A number of notable [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] buildings are to be found, including the [[Apollon Theatre (Patras)|Apollon Theatre]] in Georgiou I Square, the City Hall, the headquarters of the Local Trade Association and the Court of Justice. A replica of [[Patras Lighthouse]], the city's emblematic old lighthouse – which was at the dock of ''[[Saint Nicholas|Ayios Nikolaos]]'' – rises at the end of Trion Navarchon street, near the temple of Saint Andreas.[[File:Patra banner.jpg|thumb|center|950x950px|Night view]]

*The [[Archaeological Museum of Patras|Patras Archaeological Museum]] focuses on the exhibition of various archaeological finds, from the Mycenaean to the Late Roman era, discovered in Patras and the wider Achaea region. The museum is housed in a modern and special architectural building designed by the architect Theophanis Bobotis.<ref>ΕΤ1 TV, broadcast "Mεταμουσείο", The New Archaeological Museum of Patras,18/03/2013| http://9dim-patras.ach.sch.gr/images/2018-19/2018_11_25/video/mouseio.mp4 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200129114037/http://9dim-patras.ach.sch.gr/images/2018-19/2018_11_25/video/mouseio.mp4 |date=29 January 2020 }}</ref> 
*The [[Mycenaean cemetery of Voudeni]] (Skioessa), {{Convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the center of Patras, is one of the most important sites of the Mycenaean world, showing active use for nearly five hundred years (1500–1000 BC).

The aqueduct measured {{convert|6.5|km|2|abbr=on}} from the water cistern to the castle. For the greater part of this distance, the water passed through an underground channel, passing over valleys and gorges on carefully constructed archways, parts of which still stand, in the area of [[Aroi, Patras|Aroi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-patras.gr/portal/web/common/461|title=Ρωμαϊκό Υδραγωγείο|publisher=e-patras.gr|access-date=2012-10-02|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120730160237/http://www.e-patras.gr/portal/web/common/461|archive-date=2012-07-30}}</ref> 
Other Roman monuments include the ruins of the Roman stadium, remains of the Roman wall and a preserved bridge over the river Kallinaos.
*The medieval [[Patras Castle]], in the ancient acropolis overlooking the city, was initially built in the 6th century AD by the [[Byzantine]] emperor [[Justinian]], having many additions from the period of the Frankish and Venetian rule of the city, up to as far as the time of the [[Despotate of Morea]] and later the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Its current outline dates back to the second Venetian rule of the town (1687–1715). Today, is visiting and its interior is used as a public garden.

The square's fountains were installed in 1875 at a cost of 70,000 drachmas each, a huge amount for the finances of Greece and Patra at the time. It was and continues to be the center of political and cultural life in the city, hosting all significant activities, political gatherings, rallies, cultural events and, most importantly for some, its carnival.
*[[Ethnikis Antistaseos Square (Patras)|Ethnikis Antistaseos]] ("National Resistance Square")

*[[Psilalonia]] Square ({{Lang|el|Ψηλαλώνια}} or formally {{Lang|el|Πλατεία Υψηλών Αλωνίων}}) is one of Patras's most popular squares. It is {{convert|1.5|km|abbr=on}} from downtown Patras, next to the city's main north–south street, Gounari Street. It features a fountain, many sidewalks, [[Palm tree|palm]] trees and playgrounds. A bronze statue of [[Germanos of Patras]] stands on the northern end, while a memorial plaque to people executed during the [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Axis occupation of Greece]] stands on the south-western corner. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} It is surrounded by several shops, restaurants and cafes and a number of [[Modern architecture|modernist]] buildings. It was completed in the mid-to-late 19th century, when trees were added, along with neoclassical buildings. After World War II and the [[Greek Civil War]], however, and through the 1960s and 1970s, most neoclassical buildings were replaced by eight-storey residential buildings. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} In the west end, a {{convert|15|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall}} cliff overlooks the pedestrian [[Trion Navarchon Street]], and offers a wide vista across the western [[Gulf of Patras]], including the mountains of [[Aetolia-Acarnania|Aitoloakarnania]].[[File:Διακήρυξη επαναστατών Πάτρας 1821.jpg|thumb|160px|right|The declaration of the revolutionaries of Patras (1821), engraved on a stele, Saint George Square]]

* The Spinney of Patras ({{Lang|el|Δασύλλιο}}), is in a pine-tree-covered hill, which is dubbed "the [[Gulf of Patras]]' veranda" because of the panoramic view it offers. The spinney is ideal for recreational walks and jogging, with its specially formed paths and the shade offered by the tall trees.

Patra is a relatively newly built city, as its medieval buildings were completely destroyed in the [[Greek War of Independence]]. The oldest surviving buildings (apart from ancient monuments and the castle) are the church of [[Pantocrator Church, Patras|Pantocrator]] in Ano Poli and a residential building (Tzini's house) at the corner of Agiou Nikolaou and Maisonos street, built in 1832. The area on the south of the castle, around the Roman [[Odeon (building)|Odeon]], the church of Pantokrator, in the Upper Town (Ano Poli), is the most appealing of the city, because of its status as the only area where construction height is limited to two-storey buildings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westpoint.gr/news_details.php?id=18 |title=WESTPOINT - Mια αρχιτεκτονική βόλτα στην Πάτρα |publisher=Westpoint.gr |access-date=2012-10-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326122813/http://www.westpoint.gr/news_details.php?id=18 |archive-date=2012-03-26 }}</ref>
Ιn Ano Poli is interesting the old school complex "Georgios Glarakis" work of the architect Georgios Petrιtsopoulos in 1931 which is built with stone and recently became a nice bioclimatic school.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} At the beginning of the 20th century, outside the school complex "Georgios Glarakis", line 2 of the tram ended, starting from Agios Dionysios, going up  Dimitriou Gounari Street, passing behind the church of Pantanassa, entering Roman Odeon and finished outside the Glarakis school complex.{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}

Historical buildings and mansions of the city, apart Tzini's house, include also the Prapopoulos building, Golfinopoulos mansion (''Alhambra''), Perivolaropoulos mansion, Palamas house, while among the demolished after WWII were Tsiklitiras mansion, Kanellopoulos house, Chaidopoulos building, Frangopoulos house, Green mansion and Mineyko mansion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thebest.gr/amp/article/516216- |title=Αρχιτεκτονικοί θησαυροί της Πάτρας που έγιναν πολυκατοικίες |access-date=30 March 2020 |archive-date=6 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806090447/https://www.thebest.gr/amp/article/516216- |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Geography==
Patras is {{convert|215|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of Athens by road, {{convert|94|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Pyrgos, Elis|Pyrgos]], {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Rio, Greece|Rio]], {{convert|134|km|mi|0|abbr=in}} west of [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], {{convert|77|km|0|abbr=in}} northwest of [[Kalavryta]] and {{convert|144|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]].

A central feature of the [[urban geography]] of Patras is its division into upper and lower sections. This is the result of an interplay between natural geography and human settlement patterns; the lower section of the city (Kato Poli), which includes the 19th-century urban core and the port, is adjacent to the sea and stretches between the estuaries of the rivers of Glafkos and Haradros. It is built on what was originally a bed of river soils and dried-up swamps. The older upper section (Ano Poli) covers the area of the pre-modern settlement, around the Fortress, on what is the last elevation of Mount Panachaikon ({{convert|1926|m|ft|0|abbr=on}})<ref name="ABC">{{cite web|url=http://www.ditikiellada-region.com/en_contents.asp?id=92|title=Region of Western Greece: Geography|publisher=Ditikiellda-region.com|access-date=9 February 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927214544/http://www.ditikiellada-region.com/en_contents.asp?id=92|archive-date=27 September 2007}}</ref> before the Gulf of Patras.

===Hydrology===
The largest river in the area is the [[Glafkos (river)|Glafkos]], flowing to the south of Patras. Glafkos springs in Mount [[Panachaikon]] and its water is, since 1925, collected in a small mountainous reservoir-dam near the village of Souli and subsequently pumped in order to provide energy for the country's first [[hydroelectric plant]].<ref>Thomopoulos, St. N, ''History of the City of Patras from Antiquity to 1821'', Patrai 1952, (ed. Triantafyllou, K.N.)</ref> Other smaller streams are ''[[Charadros]]'', ''[[Meilichos]]'', ''Kallinaos'', ''[[Panagitsa (stream)|Panagitsa]]'' and the mountain torrent ''Diakoniaris''.

===Climate===
Patras, like much of [[Western Greece]], has a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Csa''). It features the typical mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers, with spring and autumn being pleasant transitional seasons. Autumn in Patras, however, is wetter than spring. Humidity is high during the winter months and lower during the summer. Snowfall is extremely rare in coastal areas but is more common and abundant in the surrounding mountains. Patras falls in 10b [[hardiness zone]].<ref name="meteo.gr">{{cite web | url=https://www.meteo.gr/Monthly_Bulletins.cfm | title=Meteo.gr - Προγνώσεις καιρού για όλη την Ελλάδα | access-date=13 January 2024 | archive-date=2 February 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230202121511/https://meteo.gr/Monthly_Bulletins.cfm | url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:The city of Patras from the Dasillio hill.jpg|300px|thumb|The city of Patras from the Dasyllio hill with a view of the Patraikos-Corinthiakos Gulf and the Rio-Antirio Bridge.]]Of great importance for the biological diversity of the area and the preservation of its climate is the swamp of [[Agyia]], a small and coastal [[aquatic ecosystem]] of only {{convert|30|ha|abbr=on|}}, north of the city centre. The main features of this wetland are its apparent survival difficulty, being at the heart of a densely populated urban centre that features a relatively arid climate and its admittedly high level of biodiversity, with over 90 species of birds being observed until the early 1990s, according to a study by the Patras Bureau of the ''Hellenic Ornithological Society''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Chris K |url=http://www.ornithologiki.gr/en/enmain.htm |publisher=Hellenic Ornithological Society |title=Birds, birding and conservation in Greece |access-date=2009-01-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225143515/http://www.ornithologiki.gr/en/enmain.htm |archive-date=25 December 2008 }}</ref>

The paper sector is also active including a paper factory belonging to [[Georgia-Pacific]] (''Delica'') and two important Greek companies, ''Elite'' and ''El-pack'', headquartered in the city.

Patras has several packing and industrial equipment companies. The most important of them are the local ''Antzoulatos'' and the [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[Frigoglass]], a subsidiary of [[Coca-Cola]], headquartered in the suburbs of Patras. [[Ideal Bikes]] is the leading bike producer in Greece, with large export activities.

The once omnipresent [[textile industry]] of the city is now almost defunct after the shut-down of the huge factory of ''[[Peiraiki-Patraiki]]'' (Πειραϊκή-Πατραϊκή), followed by numerous smaller textile industries. The remains of the facilities still cover hundreds of acres in the south side of the city.

The cultural activity of Patras includes the Patras International Festival (with various artistic activities, mainly in the fields of theatre and music), the [[Patras Carnival]]  and the Poetry Symposium.<ref name="Poetry Symposium">{{cite web |url=http://www.poetrysymposium.gr/ |title=Συμπόσιο Ποίησης |publisher=Poetrysymposium.gr |date=2012-07-18 |access-date=2012-10-02 |archive-date=30 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930154817/http://www.poetrysymposium.gr/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city hosts many museums, including the [[Archaeological Museum of Patras|Patras Archaeological Museum]]  the History and Ethnology Museum, the Folk Art Museum, the Press Museum and the Technology Museum, the latter in the campus of [[Patras University]].

Other cultural institutes are: the Visual Arts Workshop, the [[icon]] painting school, the [[Carnival]] Float Workshop, the Municipal [[Library]], the Municipal [[Art museum|Gallery]], along with many private art galleries. The architectural heritage of the city is dominated by neo-classicism, but also includes structures from other periods. Patras is also a pilot city of the [[Council of Europe]] and EU [[Intercultural cities]]  programme.

===Theatrical tradition and music===

The [[Patras Municipal and Regional Theatre]] was founded in June 1988, having as its main stage the city's landmark, the [[Apollon Theatre (Patras)|Apollon Theatre]]. Throughout its existence it has mounted critically acclaimed performances ranging from ancient [[dramaturgy]] and modern Greek, to international repertoire. The theatre cooperates with other theatrical groups, such as the ''Viomichaniki'' (Industrial) group and the ''Michani Technis'' (Art Machine).

The Roman [[Odeon (building)|Odeon]] hosts ancient dramas in the summer, while the Pantheon theater, the Art Factory, the Lithographeion and the Agora theatres provide additional venues. The International Festival of Patras takes place every summer, with a program consisting mostly of plays—both ancient drama and modern theatre—as well as various musical events.

Patras has also a very strong [[indie rock]] scene {{citation needed|date=January 2022}} with critically acclaimed bands such as [[Raining Pleasure]], Abbie Gale, Serpentine, Doch an Doris and others.

===Carnival===

The [[Patras Carnival]] (''Patrino Karnavali'') is the largest event of its kind in Greece and one of the biggest in Europe, with a heritage reaching back 160 years. The events begin on 17 January each year (St. Anthony's nameday), and last until [[Clean Monday]]. Hundreds of thousands of visitors from all over the world gather each year for its festivities, which include large events such as the mammoth sized parades of the last two weeks (up to 50.000 participants each), the Hidden Treasure Hunt (Krymmenos Thisavros), concerts, expositions, theatrical, musical, comedy and other artistic contests and events. 
Patras Carnival was originally introduced as ball-masquee' events in 1835 by the Italian origin merchant family of Moretti.

===European Capital of Culture 2006===
[[File:2006 Greece 10 Euro Patras front.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2006 coinage|Patras 2006 commemorative coin]].]]

Patras was chosen by the [[European Commission]] to be the [[European Capital of Culture]] for the year 2006. The concept of the event revolved around the main theme of "Bridges" and "Dialogues", drawing benefit from the city's rich history and its position as a "Gate to the West", to underline the essence of the productive interaction of culture and civilisations in Europe. The EU Commission found Patras' plans very ambitious and also commented that a successful hosting of the title by a medium-sized city would make it possible to redefine the meaning of the term Cultural Capital.

The Selection Panel for 2006 noted in its final report:

{{blockquote|The current cultural activity of the city includes the Patras International Festival (various artistic activities, mainly in the field of music), the Patras Carnival and the Poetry Symposium (organised each year for the 25 years by an ad hoc committee at the University of Patras).<ref name="Poetry Symposium"/> The Patras 2006 proposal focuses on two central ideas: "bridges" and "dialogues". Cultural managers from Patras and the general public will be involved in developing these ideas. Further, four poles/programmes of cultural attraction will be developed. The first, "A city for Europe", will relate to the architectural heritage, the industrial revolution and similar subjects. "The counterpart cities" programme will be developed in the fields of human and social sciences and in diverse artistic fields. "The three sea battles" will present a cultural programme focusing on peace and understanding. The last theme, "The many homelands", is directly linked to the etymology of the name of the city. This programme will among other things concentrate on art workshops, the transfer of know-how, way of life and entertainment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu.int/comm/culture/eac/other_actions/cap_europ/pdf_word/patras_final_report.pdf|title=Patras Final Report|publisher=Europa.eu.int|access-date=2012-10-02|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060325110128/http://europa.eu.int/comm/culture/eac/other_actions/cap_europ/pdf_word/patras_final_report.pdf|archive-date=2006-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu.int/comm/culture/eac/other_actions/cap_europ/cap_futur_en.html|title=Patras Future Report|publisher=Europa.eu.int|access-date=2012-10-02|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504210548/http://europa.eu.int/comm/culture/eac/other_actions/cap_europ/cap_futur_en.html|archive-date=2006-05-04}}</ref> }}

In 2006 various cultural events were held in the context of the European Capital of Culture. Among the artists presenting their work in Patras were: [[Gary Burton]], [[Maxim Shostakovich]], [[Ian Anderson]] - with the Patras Municipal Orchestra, [[Jean Louis Trintignant]], [[Roberto Benigni]], [[Eros Ramazzotti]] and [[José Carreras]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-patras.gr/portal/web/common/136|title=Πολιτισμός|publisher=e-patras.gr|access-date=2012-10-02|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120728222922/http://www.e-patras.gr/portal/web/common/136|archive-date=2012-07-28}}</ref> With the completion of the Capital of Culture programme, a part of the old Ladopoulos factory was renovated to host exhibitions, a small theatre (named the Art Factory), was built and a number of neoclassical buildings around the city were renovated as part of a plan to preserve the city's architectural heritage and link it to its cultural life. The new [[Archaeological Museum of Patras|Archaeological museum]] was completed in 2009. Its globe-like roof and modern architectural design enhances the town's northern entrance, taking its place among the other city landmarks.

[[File:Patras Anglican Church.JPG|thumb|240px|The [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] Church of Saint Andrew.]]
The city is the seat of the [[Church of Greece|Greek Orthodox]] [[Metropolis of Patras]]. As in the rest of the country, the largest denomination is the Orthodox Church, which represents the majority of the population. There is also a sizeable community of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and an [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] church, part of the [[Church of England]]'s [[Diocese in Europe]].<ref name=anglican>Diocese in Europe, [https://europe.anglican.org/where-we-are/church-locations/greece/patras Greece: Patras] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101012316/https://europe.anglican.org/where-we-are/church-locations/greece/patras |date=1 November 2020 }}, accessed 5 September 2020</ref>
[[File:Old Saint Andrew church, Patra 9281555.jpg|thumb|220px|The old Orthodox church of Saint Andrew, next to the Cathedral]]
The most significant church in the city is the Orthodox [[Cathedral of Saint Andrew, Patras|Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew]], in the south west of the city center. The construction of the church began in 1908 under the supervision of the architect [[Anastasios Metaxas]], followed by Georgios Nomikos. It was inaugurated in 1974. It is the largest church in Greece and the third-largest Byzantine-style church in the [[Balkans]], after the [[Cathedral of Saint Sava]] in Belgrade and [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Sofia]]. It holds relics of [[Andrew the Apostle]], which were returned to the city of Patras from [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Rome in September, 1964, on the orders of [[Pope Paul VI]].
Other historical churches of the city are: 
*The church of ''Pantokrator'' (1832), the old cathedral, in the upper town district
*The ''Metropolitan Church of Patras'' (1846) dedicated to [[Panayia]] Evangelistria, on Maisonos Street
*The church of ''Ayios Nikolaos'' (1885), next to the steps of Ayiou Nikolaou street 
*The church of ''Pantanassa'' (1859), Ipsilanti street
*The church of ''Ayios Dimitrios'', in the upper town district 
*The Catholic Church of ''Saint Andrew'' (1937), on Maisonos Street
*The [[Anglican]] church of ''Saint Andrew'' (1878), on Odos Agiou Andreou <ref name=anglican /> 
*The old church of ''Ayios Andreas'' (1836–1843), next to the new temple. Situated in the site of [[Andrew the Apostle]]'s martyrdom, it was built in [[basilica]] style by the architect [[Lysandros Kaftanzoglou]].
*''Girokomiou Monastery (Holy Monastery of Panagia Girokomitissa)'': This historic monastery was founded in the 10th century AD in the eastern part of Patras. It was built on the ruins of an ancient temple of the goddess Artemis and for this reason the monastery's cathedral is dedicated to Saint Artemiοs. It is obvious that the monastery maintained a nursing home during the Byzantine period.
*''Monastery of Agios Nikolaos Bala (Paleomonastiro):'' Ιt is built at the foot of Panachaikos, at an altitude of 500 meters, near the village of Bala, 8&nbsp;km northeast of Patras. This historic and picturesque monastery was founded at the end of the 17th century. A marble slab on the north outer side of the Cathedral tells of the restoration of the monastery in 1693. The monastery has also recently been renovated, numbering nineteen nuns and celebrating 6 December and 10 May.
The patron saint of Patras is [[Saint Andrew the Apostle]]. One of the modern saints is Saint [[Gervasios Paraskevopoulos]]  of Patras (2023)

The city has a significant political history in modern Greece; famous politicians from Patras include the prime ministers [[Dimitrios Gounaris]], the main leader of the [[Venizelism|anti-venizelist]] party in the 1910s, [[Stylianos Gonatas]], a high-ranking officer, politician and one of the leaders of the "1922 Revolution", [[Andreas Michalakopoulos]], a prominent [[Komma Fileleftheron|liberal party]] cadre, foreign minister and prime minister, and [[Dimitrios Maximos]], a distinguished economist, minister and finally prime minister in the [[Greek Civil War|civil war era]]. More recent figures include the [[Papandreou]] family, arguably the most influential in post World War II Greece, [[Panagiotis Kanellopoulos]], the last democratically elected head of government before the establishment of the 1967 [[Greek military junta of 1967&ndash;1974|junta]], and [[Costis Stephanopoulos]], the former president of the Hellenic Republic.

===Seaport===
The city has always been a sea-trade hub because of its strategic position. The port manages more than half of the foreign sea-passenger transportation in Greece,<ref name="olpstats">{{cite web |url= http://www.patrasport.gr/el/organization/stats.html |script-title=el:ΟΛΠ - Στατιστικά στοιχεία |language=el |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080404011151/http://www.patrasport.gr/el/organization/stats.html |archive-date= 2008-04-04|title= }}</ref> and has excellent car-ferry links with the [[Ionian islands]] and the major [[Adriatic]] ports of Italy. Additionally, a new port was built in the southern section of the city to accommodate the increased traffic and relieve the city centre from port operations.<ref name="olp">http://www.patrasport.gr {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210129042321/http://www.patrasport.gr/ |date=29 January 2021 }}: [http://www.patrasport.gr/cms/?page_id=1238&lang=en ''The Port''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191022084223/http://www.patrasport.gr/cms/?page_id=1238&lang=en |date=22 October 2019 }}</ref>  In 2011, this port went into operation.

The port is connected by a number of daily routes to the Ionian islands [[Kerkyra]], [[Kefallonia]] and [[Zakynthos]], to the port of [[Igoumenitsa]] and to the Italian cities [[Ancona]], [[Bari]], [[Brindisi]], [[Trieste]] and [[Venice]].<ref name="e-patras.gr"/>

===Roads===
A newly constructed, {{convert|20|km|mi|adj=mid}} [[Greek National Road 9|ring road]] (the Bypass of Patras) was first opened in 2002 in order to alleviate heavy traffic throughout the city.<ref name="perimetrikh">{{cite web|url=http://www.ditikiellada.gov.gr/mediaupload/%C1%F1%F7%E5%DF%E1%20%E5%F6%E1%F1%EC%EF%E3%DE%F2/par_patra.pdf|title=Ring Road map|publisher=Dikitiellada.gov.gr|access-date=2012-10-02}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> A mini ring road (known as the "Mini bypass" of Patras) is now complete (2019), alleviating heavy traffic-related problems in the city centre.<ref name="minibelt">{{cite web|url=http://www.ditikiellada.gov.gr/contents.asp?id=289|title=Works under construction in the region of Western Greece|publisher=Ditikiellada.gov.gr|access-date=2012-10-02|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223161935/http://www.ditikiellada.gov.gr/contents.asp?id=289|archive-date=2009-02-23}}</ref> The mini-bypass is a two lanes mototway bridging the northern city entrance at the Zavlani neighborhood to the eastern entrance at the Aroi, Synora and Upper town (Ano poli) neighborhoods reducing the city centre crossing time to less than 4 minutes drive.

Two large highways were also constructed, connecting the seacoast and the new port with the Bypass of Patras. The first is over the small Diakoniaris river (from Eleftheriou Venizelou street until the Bypass'es exit in [[Eglykada]]), while the second consists of two roads, {{convert|4|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} each, that run in parallel with the [[Glafkos (river)|Glafkos]] river entering at the city' s New Port.<ref>{{cite web |author=Loizos Bailas, Mixalis Kaplanidis |url=http://www.michaniki.gr/newsite/erga_new_35.cfm |title=MHXANIKH AE |publisher=Michaniki.gr |access-date=2009-01-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928043914/http://www.michaniki.gr/newsite/erga_new_35.cfm |archive-date=2007-09-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Loizos Bailas, Mixalis Kaplanidis |url=http://www.michaniki.gr/newsite/erga_new_30.cfm |title=MHXANIKH AE |publisher=Michaniki.gr |access-date=2009-01-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928043927/http://www.michaniki.gr/newsite/erga_new_30.cfm |archive-date=2007-09-28 }}</ref> Another project was completed recently, leading to an additional entrance to the downtown area after expanding and widening Kanakari street.

The highway connection with Athens was recently{{when|date=July 2024}} upgraded to a 220&nbsp;km closed highway (Olympia odos), with a speed limit of 130&nbsp;km/hour, reducing the transit time to 1 hour and 45 minutes.

The [[Rio-Antirio bridge]] is north of the city and links the [[Peloponnese]] to mainland Greece. It was completed in August 2004.

Additional work was recently announced to begin in 2023 in order to connect via highway the Rion Antirrion bridge with Nafpaktos, Itea, Amfissa and Lamia. This project is expected to reduce the trip to Lamia to 90 minutes and its completion is expexted in 2025.

Patras is bypassed by the [[Olympia Odos]] (A8) motorway, which is also part of the [[European route E55|E55]] route that crosses the [[Rio-Antirio Bridge]], dominating the sealine across the [[Gulf of Corinth]].

===Rail===
A rudimentary [[single track (rail)|single]], [[narrow gauge railway]] track crosses the city and connects it to [[Rio, Greece|Rio]]. In the past regional rail links were provided by the [[Hellenic Railways Organisation]], connecting Patras to Athens and Piraeus as well as to [[Pyrgos, Elis|Pyrgos]] and [[Kalamata]].<ref name="e-patras.gr">{{cite web|url=http://www.e-patras.gr/portal/web/visitors/84|title=Πως θα έρθετε|publisher=e-patras.gr|access-date=2012-10-02|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130217152257/http://www.e-patras.gr/portal/web/visitors/84|archive-date=2013-02-17}}</ref> OSE announced the suspension of all the rail service in the Peloponnese in January 2011<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.naftemporiki.gr/finance/story/263478/trainose-diakopi-dromologion-kai-auksisi-komistron|title=ΤΡΑΙΝΟΣΕ: Διακοπή δρομολογίων και αύξηση κομίστρων &#124; naftemporiki.gr|date=23 December 2010|website=www.naftemporiki.gr|access-date=23 September 2019|archive-date=23 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923172149/https://www.naftemporiki.gr/finance/story/263478/trainose-diakopi-dromologion-kai-auksisi-komistron|url-status=live}}</ref> so today the railway track is in use only by suburban trains that connect Patras with the adjacent villages of Rio and Agios Vasileios.

The [[Patras railway station|central passenger train station of Patras]] which is a small building constructed in 1954, lies to the west of the downtown area, between [[Othonos-Amalias Avenue]] and the north port. The main freight station of Aghios Andreas lies further to the south, next to the homonymous church and it is not in use any more. Finally, the old depot of Aghios Dionysios, consisting of about ten tracks, offers basic turntable and roundhouse facilities; it is about {{convert|400|m|2|abbr=on}} long.

A new double [[standard gauge]] railway line, the [[Athens Airport–Patras railway]], is under construction and will link Patras to [[Korinth]] and further to [[Athens]]. The construction works are currently in progress close to the suburbs of Patras,  but the remaining few kilometres till the city centre and the new port are still under study because of various financial and technical problems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ergose.gr/project/rio_neos_limenas_patron/?lang=en|title=Rio – New Port of Patras|access-date=27 April 2018|archive-date=28 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428094032/https://www.ergose.gr/project/rio_neos_limenas_patron/?lang=en|url-status=live}}</ref> As of 2020, the new railway reaches [[Aigio]], {{convert|40|km}} east of Patras.

===Public transport===

Patras is served by buses. There are two transport lines to and from the [[University of Patras]] and some nearby lines to city suburbs such as [[Saravali]], [[Zarouchleika|Glafkos]], and [[Paralia, Achaea|Paralia]]. All the urban bus lines are about 40, with three numbers.{{Clarify|reason=Not sure what could be meant by this sentence.|date=May 2020}}

Commuter rail services have recently been established by [[Proastiakos]], with one line currently connecting Patras, [[Rio, Greece|Rio]], and Agios Vasileios.

Regional bus links are provided by the [[KTEL (Greece)|KTEL]] bus company and connect the city to most of Greece.

===Air===
Seasonal civilian air transport is provided by the military [[Patras Araxos Airport]], about {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} from the city's centre.

==International relations==
Patras is a pilot city of the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[European Commission]] '''[[Intercultural cities]]''' programme.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/culture/Cities/patras_en.asp |title=Intercultural city: Patras, Greece |last=[[Council of Europe]] |work=coe.int |year=2011 |access-date=22 May 2011 |archive-date=28 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528113752/http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/culture/cities/patras_en.asp |url-status=live }}</ref>
