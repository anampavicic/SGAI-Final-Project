==History==
[[File:11Córdoba desde el camino de Coscomatépec.png|thumbnail|''Córdoba desde el camino de Coscomatépec'' by [[Casimiro Castro]], c. 1877]]

=== Colonial period ===
The village of Córdoba was founded in 1618 by the Spanish to protect royal interests from attacks by [[Gaspar Yanga]]'s slave rebellion.

=== Mexican War of Independence ===
After the capture of the city by Mexican rebel forces in August 1821, the Mexican revolutionary [[Agustín de Iturbide]] and the Spanish viceroy [[Juan de O'Donojú]] signed the [[Treaty of Córdoba]] here, ratifying the [[Plan de Iguala]] and confirming Mexico's independence.

In 1902 Córdoba became the interchange point of the [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] [[Córdoba and Huatusco Railroad]] to Coscomatepec.

===Modern times===
The city was severely damaged by the [[1973 Veracruz earthquake]].<ref name="cordoba.com.mx"/>

==Economy==
The main economic activities are agriculture, ranching, industry and trade. The principal crops are [[sugar cane]], [[coffee]], [[avocado]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[lemon]], and [[rice]], along with some non-traditional crops as anturios, [[heliconia]]s and palma camedor.

A highway connects Córdoba with the state's principal port, [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]]. There is an adequate workforce, with a relatively low annual wage, providing opportunities for hiring for industry.

Córdoba is the focal point for the local [[sugar refinery|sugar milling]] and [[coffee processing]] industries, and it is also an important place for marketing and refining tropical fruits.
 
Several medical institutions provide public-health services in Córdoba, including the [[Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers|ISSSTE]], the [[Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social|IMSS]], and the SCSP. There is also a local Cruz Roja (Red Cross) hospital, and several private hospitals.

The city has a large number of entertainment centers, including billiard halls, ballrooms and discothèques. Cordoba has three libraries, three auditoriums, a theatre and a museum.<ref name="cordoba.com.mx"/>

== Transportation ==
From 1902 to 1953, Córdoba was served by the [[Córdoba and Huatusco Railroad]] [[narrow gauge]] railroad. The line operated as a unique and scenic {{RailGauge|2ft}} gauge branch of [[Ferrocarril Mexicano (1867–1959)|Ferrocarril Mexicano]] from 1909 through 1951.

==Demographics==
As of 2020, the municipality of Córdoba has an approximate population of 204,721 inhabitants, 139,075 residing in the municipal seat, which represents 2.57% of the total population of the State of Veracruz,<ref name=CORDOBACENSUS2020>{{cite web |url=http://ceieg.veracruz.gob.mx/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2021/06/C%C3%93RDOBA_2021.pdf|title=Córdoba CENSO 2020 |website=www.veracruz.gob.mx |access-date=6 September 2023}}</ref> which makes it the 6th largest in the state. Other localities include San Román (10,907 hab.), Crucero Nacional (8,479 hab.), La Luz y Trinidad Palotal (3,584 hab.) and Colorines (2,911 hab.).<ref name=CORDOBACENSUS2020/>

==Notable locations==
One of Córdoba's most important locations is its [[zócalo]] (main square). The square, called the Parque de 21 de Mayo, uses the traditional Spanish layout, with a church on the east side, the Palacio Municipal (city hall) on the west, and commercial establishments on the north and south sides.<ref name="cordoba.com.mx"/>
