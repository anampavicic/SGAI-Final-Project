==History==
[[File:Ajdabiya, Libya - panoramio.jpg|200px|thumb|left| Ajdabiya museum]]
Traditionally, Al Wahat was the western part of [[Cyrenaica]]. With the division of Libya into ten governorates in 1963, Al Wahat became part of the Misrata Governorate. In the 1973 reorganization, it became part of Al Khalji Governorate.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Map of the ten governorates of Libya |work=Area Handbook for Libya |publisher=United States Library of Congress |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/libya/ly00_06a.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002234225/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/libya/ly00_06a.pdf |archive-date=2 October 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy}}</ref> In 1983, Al Khalji was divided into a number of [[Districts of Libya#Former baladiya|baladiyat (districts)]], with what is now Al Wahat being included in the Ajdabiya baladiyah and the Jalu baladiyah. In the 1988 reorganization, Jalu was subsumed within [[Ajdabiya District|Ajdabiya baladiyah]]. The status of the area in the reorganization of 1995 which created thirteen districts is unclear; however, in the 1998 reorganization into twenty-six districts, the name "Al-Wahad" appears as a district for the first time.<ref name="Statesman2006"/> In 2001 the area was divided between Al Wahat and Ajdabiya districts.<ref name="statoids"/>  In 2007, the former Al Wahat district (area:108,670&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) was enlarged to include what had been the [[Ajdabiya District]] and part of [[Kufra District]].<ref name="Shabyat-2007" /> It now has essentially the boundaries that the [[Districts of Libya#Former baladiya|baladiyah (district)]] of [[Ajdabiya District|Ajdabiya]] did from 1988 to 1995.<ref name="LAJ-Map">{{Cite map|title=Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (Map No. 3787 Rev 1) |author=Cartographic Section, Department of Public Information, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya |publisher=United Nations |date=April 1994 |url=http://www.undp-pogar.org/countries/libya/libya.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030626055744/http://www.undp-pogar.org/countries/libya/libya.pdf |archivedate=26 June 2003 |url-status=dead |df=dmy}}</ref>
