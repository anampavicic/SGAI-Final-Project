'''San Nicolás de los Arroyos''' (usually shortened to ''San Nicolás'') is a city in the [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], Argentina, on the western shore of the [[Paraná River]], {{convert|61|km|abbr=on}} from [[Rosario]]. It has about 133,000 inhabitants ({{census-ar|2010}}). It is the administrative seat of the ''[[Partidos of Buenos Aires|partido]]'' of the same name. It is sometimes called ''Ciudad de María'' (City of Mary) due to a series of Marian apparitions that led to the erection of the Sanctuary in honor of [[Our Lady of the Rosary of San Nicolás]] that began during the 1980s and were approved by Bishop Cardelli of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Nicolás de los Arroyos|diocese]] as "worthy of belief" in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/33982/a-marian-apparition-has-been-approved-in-argentina-and-its-a-big-deal|title=A Marian apparition has been approved in Argentina - and it's a big deal|access-date=2017-01-23|archive-date=2020-11-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201125003358/https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/a-marian-apparition-has-been-approved-in-argentina---and-its-a-big-deal-31979|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
{{stack|[[File:Santuario de Nuestra Señora del Rosario de San Nicolás.JPG|upright|thumb|Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Rosary of San Nicolás]]}}
San Nicolás de los Arroyos was founded on 14 April 1748 by Rafael de Aguiar, who gave it its name to honour [[Saint Nicholas of Bari]], now patron of the city.

The closeness to the border between Buenos Aires and two other large provinces made the city a natural stage for the struggle between [[Federalist Party (Argentina)|federalist]] and [[Unitarian Party|Unitarians]] forces in mid-19th century. The agreement between thirteen provinces on 31 May 1852, which ratified the [[Pacto Federal|Federal Pact]] and called for a [[Constitution of Argentina|Constitutional]] Assembly sponsored by [[Justo José de Urquiza]], was signed in this town, and became known as ''[[San Nicolás Agreement|Acuerdo de San Nicolás de los Arroyos]]''.

==Geography==

The city is located in the north-east of the province of Buenos Aires, 240&nbsp;km from [[Buenos Aires]] City, within the so-called ''Industrial Corridor'' that goes from [[Greater Rosario]] to [[La Plata]]. Its limits are: to the west, [[Pergamino Partido|Pergamino]]; to the south, [[Ramallo Partido|Ramallo]]; to the east, with the Paraná River, which separates it from the province of [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]]; and to the north, with the [[Arroyo del Medio]], a small river that separates it from the province of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]].

Its main accesses are in the north–south axis: the [[National Route 9 (Argentina)|Rosario-Buenos Aires Highway]], and the [[Nuevo Central Argentino]] railroad.

San Nicolás has [[Port of San Nicolás de los Arroyos|an important port]] on the Paraná, able to service large cargo ships. The railway system has passenger and cargo stations, the latter reaching up to the port.

==Education==
[[File:Frente aguiar 000 0002.png|thumb|210px|Rafael de Aguiar Public Library]]
The city has 43 kindergarten institutions, 58 schools of Elementary Education, 28 of High-school level (both public and private), 26 schools for adults and a large number of tertiary studies institutes.
It is also home of the San Nicolás Regional Faculty, a branch of the [[Universidad Tecnológica Nacional|National Technological University (UTN)]].

==Cultural life==

There are a variety cultural institutions in the city, though the most important one is perhaps the [[Rafael de Aguiar Municipal Theatre]], founded on August 10, 1908, and designed as a smaller model of the [[Teatro Colón]] in Buenos Aires.

Among the many libraries in the city, the oldest and largest is the [[Biblioteca Popular Rafael de Aguiar|Rafael de Aguiar Popular Library]], founded in 1947 by Juana Couretot de Guella.
