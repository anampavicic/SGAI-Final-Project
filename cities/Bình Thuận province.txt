'''Bình Thuận''' is a southernmost coastal [[Provinces of Vietnam|province]] in the [[South Central Coast]] region, the [[Central Vietnam|Central]] of [[Vietnam]]. It borders [[Lâm Đồng]] to the north, [[Ninh Thuận]] to the northeast, [[Đồng Nai]] to the west, [[Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu]] to the southwest and the [[South China Sea|East Sea]] to the east.

Bình Thuận province is sometimes seen as part of the [[Southeast (Vietnam)|Southeast]] region, the [[Southern Vietnam|Southern]]. The province is known for its scenery and beaches. There are also a number of sites of archaeological significance.

==History==
[[File:Province de Binh-Thuan (1909).jpg|thumb|left|Map of Binh Thuan province in 1909]]
[[File:Bản vẽ thành Bình Thuận.jpg|thumb|Drawing of Bình Thuận citadel in the Nguyễn dynasty]]
Much of what is now Bình Thuận province was part of the [[Champa|Cham]] principality of Panduranga, which had its political centre in neighbouring [[Ninh Thuận province]]. It was the last independent principality after the fall of [[Vijaya (Champa)|Vijaya]] in 1471. Both Ninh Thuận and Bình Thuận were later incorporated into Vietnam in 1832. Before 1976, Bình Thuận province was much smaller because much of the west was in the separate [[Bình Tuy province]]). Bình Tuy, Bình Thuận and Ninh Thuận were merged in 1976 to form [[:vi:Thuận Hải|Thuận Hải province]]. It was divided again into Ninh Thuận and Binh Thuận in 1991, while Bình Tuy remained part of Bình Thuận Province. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Geography==
Bình Thuận has much of the borders with Lâm Đồng and Ninh Thuận are mountainous, while much of the rest of the province is relatively flat. However, there are several hills with a height of at least 200 m along the coast of the province.<ref name=Atlat>''Atlat Dia li Viet Nam'' (Geographical Atlas of Vietnam). NXB Giao Duc, Hanoi: 2010</ref> The highest peak in the province (1548m) is in northwestern [[Tánh Linh District]], near Lâm Đồng.<ref name=Atlas10>''Viet Nam Administrative Atlas''. Cartographic Publishing House, Hanoi 2010</ref> [[Phú Quý]] island is located around 120&nbsp;km south-east of [[Phan Thiết]]. It is a separate district. There are several much smaller islands off the coast of Bình Thuận, including Câu Island (cù lao Câu) in the east, Lao Island (hòn Lao) at [[Mũi Né]], and Bà Island (hòn Bà) in the west.<ref name=Atlas10/>

Bình Thuận has several rivers mostly originating in the province itself or in the highlands of neighboring Lâm Đồng Province. Most flow into the [[East Vietnam Sea]]. Some of the major rivers are the Luỹ River (Sông Luỹ) in the east, the Cái River (Sông Cái) in the centre, and the Dinh River (Sông Dinh) in the west.<ref name=Atlas10/> [[La Ngà River]] (Sông La Ngà) flows through four districts in the northwest of the province and is a major tributary of the [[Đồng Nai River]].<ref name=Atlat/> The largest lake is Sông Quán Lake (hồ Sông Quán) in the centre of the province around 30&nbsp; km north of Phan Thiết. Another major lake is Biển Lạc in the northwest region of the province.<ref name=Atlas10/>

As of 2007, 50% of the province (394,100 ha) is covered with forests, which is high compared to most other provinces of the [[South Central Coast]] region.<ref name=GSO09>General Statistics Office (2009): ''Socio-economical Statistical Data of 63 Provinces and Cities''. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi</ref> Forests are mostly located in the province's mountainous regions in the northwest and northeast.<ref name=Atlat/> Despite its large forested area, the province also has a lot of agricultural land. 284,200 ha were used for agriculture in 2007, which is the largest figure among all provinces of the central coast regions (both [[North Central Coast|North Central]] and [[South Central Coast|South Central]]).<ref name=GSO09/>

Bình Thuận is one of the aridest provinces in Vietnam. Much of the province receives less than 800 mm of rain per year. The months from November to April are particularly dry, with less than 200 mm of rain. It has reserves of [[arsenic]] in the northwestern mountains and [[titanium]] along its western coast.<ref name=Atlat/>

==Demography==
Bình Thuận had a population of 1,170,700 people in 2007.<ref name=GSO09/> The population grew by 1.35% per year on average between 2000 and 2007. Growth was particularly strong in urban areas at 4.42% per year on average. As a result, urbanisation increased from 30.4% in 2000 to 37.5% in 2007, making it one of the most urbanized provinces of the [[South Central Coast]] (second after [[Khánh Hòa province]]).<ref name=GSO09calc>calculations based on General Statistics Office (2009): ''Socio-economical Statistical Data of 63 Provinces and Cities''. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi</ref> Population density ranges from around 1000/km<sup>2</sup> in [[Phan Thiết]] to less than 100/km<sup>2</sup> in the districts of Bắc Bình, Hàm Tân, Hàm Thuận Nam and Tánh Linh.<ref name=Atlas10/>

Apart from the majority [[Vietnamese people|Kinh]], there are several ethnic minorities in the province. Some [[Cham people|Cham]] communities are in the coastal regions of eastern Bình Thuận. Other minorities mainly inhabit the mountainous regions along the border with [[Lâm Đồng province]].<ref name=Atlat/> They include the [[Koho people|Koho]] and [[Raglai people|Raglai]].

==Administrative divisions==
Bình Thuận is subdivided into 10 district-level sub-divisions:

8 districts:
{{div col}}
* [[Bắc Bình District|Bắc Bình]]
* [[Đức Linh District|Đức Linh]]
* [[Hàm Thuận Bắc District|Hàm Thuận Bắc]]

* [[Hàm Tân District|Hàm Tân]]
* [[Phú Quý]]
* [[Tánh Linh District|Tánh Linh]]
* [[Tuy Phong District|Tuy Phong]]
{{div col end}}
1 district-level town:
* [[La Gi]]
1 provincial city:
* [[Phan Thiết]] (capital)

They are further subdivided into 12 commune-level towns (or townlets), 96 communes, and 19 wards.

==Economy==
Bình Thuận had a GDP per capita of 11 million [[VND]] in 2007, which is the third highest in the [[South Central Coast]] after [[Da Nang|Đà Nẵng]] and [[Khánh Hòa province]], and slightly higher than the regional average of 10.8 million. The economy has been the fastest growing in the South Central Coast with an average yearly growth of almost 14% from 2000 to 2007, with growth of all three sectors of the economy significantly exceeding the regional average. Agriculture, forestry and fishing had an average growth of 7.4%, industry 21.6%, and services 15.4%.<ref name="GSO09calc"/>

===Agriculture, forestry, fishing===
Bình Thuận is a relatively large producer of rice. 434,600 t were harvested in 2007. This is a significant increase from 2000 (321,500 t), although the area used for growing rice did not increase significantly (93,100 ha to 96,400 ha). Roughly one third of the province's agricultural land is used to cultivate rice, less than many other provinces. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Bình Thuận has increased the area used for some crops significantly over the last few years, including rubber, pepper and cashew nuts, while cultivation of sugar-cane and sweet potatoes has been shrinking. There are large fishing grounds off the coast of Bình Thuận and around [[Phú Quý]] island, including shrimp, squid, and tuna.<ref name=Atlat/> However, their contribution to the local economy is relatively small compared to agriculture. Forestry has made a very small contribution to the economy of the province and its growth has been slow from 2000 to 2007. The largest increase has actually been in forest cultivation rather than exploitation of forest products.<ref name="GSO09"/>

===Industry===
Bình Thuận's industry has been booming in the first years of the 21st century, with average an average growth rate of 21.6% until 2007.<ref name="GSO09calc"/> Bình Thuận's industrial development is currently facing problems of land management. Licensed industrial parks have been found to overlap with titanium reserves and their development may be delayed as a result.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Titanium ores overlap IPs in Bình Thuận |newspaper=The Saigon Times |url=http://english.thesaigontimes.vn/Home/business/environment/17521 |date=2011-06-11 |access-date=2011-07-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710173259/http://english.thesaigontimes.vn/Home/business/environment/17521/ |archive-date=2011-07-10 }}</ref> The province has seen a decline in state industry from 2000 to 2007. The private sector now makes up most of industrial output and even the foreign-invested sector has overtaken state-owned industry. Despite its spectacular growth, industry was not able to absorb much of the growth of the labour force. It created 17,200 new jobs between 2000 and 2007, while the slower growing service sector created 44,100 and even agriculture, forestry and fishing created 57,600 jobs.<ref name="GSO09"/>

==Infrastructure==

===Transport===
Bình Thuận is located along Vietnam's main north-south transport corridors. [[National Route 1 (Viet Nam)|National Route 1]] runs through the province, connecting 6 out of the province's 10 districts to the rest of the country. Bình Thuận's main railway station along the [[North–South Railway (Vietnam)|North–South Railway]] is [[Mương Mán Railway Station]], located around 10&nbsp;km northwest of [[Phan Thiết]]. Four smaller railway stations are in Phan Thiết and the eastern part of the province.<ref name=Atlas10/>

The province is connected to the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] by two national roads: 28 from Phan Thiết to [[Di Linh]] and [[Đắk Nông province]] and 55 from [[Vũng Tàu]] to [[La Gi]] and [[Bảo Lộc]]. Bình Thuận does not have an airport; the nearest commercial airport is located near [[Da Lat Airport|Đà Lạt]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Energy===
Hàm Thuận hydropower plant is located in the northwest of the province.<ref name=Atlat/> Bình Thuận is the site of several new energy projects and will be important for Vietnam's diversification away from hydropower. Bình Thuận has significant potential for wind power generation, estimated at 3,000 MW.<ref name=STAug10>{{Cite news|title=Wind power, titanium projects on direct collision course |work=The Saigon Times |url=http://www.intellasia.net/news/articles/infra_resources/111302242.shtml |date=2010-08-24 |access-date=2011-07-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004225638/http://www.intellasia.net/news/articles/infra_resources/111302242.shtml |archive-date=2011-10-04 }}</ref> The wind power project in Tuy Phong District,<ref>{{cite web |author=Binhthuantimes |url=http://www.binhthuantimes.com/modules.php?name=News&op=viewst&sid=760 |title=Wind farm to turn arid land into town |publisher=Binhthuantimes.com |access-date=2010-06-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721062136/http://www.binhthuantimes.com/modules.php?name=News&op=viewst&sid=760 |archive-date=2010-07-21 }}</ref> was set to be hooked up to the national electricity grid by 2009. The large wind energy project is expected to help boost regional socio-economic development and pave the way for further exploitation of renewable energy sources in the country. Located on Highway 1, the section running through Bình Thuận Commune, the Wind Power Plant 1 is about 300 meters from the coast. This is an arid area usually short in rainfall but abundant in wind. Other wind power projects are in preparation, with 12 licenses issued as of August 2010. However, the land for many of these projects overlaps with land with rich [[titanium]] reserves.<ref name=STAug10/> These overlaps have remained unresolved for several years.<ref name=STAug10/>

A thermoelectric plant is under construction in [[Tuy Phong District]] in the east of the province. It is a cooperation of [[Vietnam Electricity|EVN]] and Chinese investors and projected to generate 1,200MW of electricity.<ref>{{Cite news|title=TQ cho VN vay 300 triệu USD xây nhiệt điện|publisher=BBC Vietnamese|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/vietnamese/vietnam/2010/12/101218_china_vn_loan.shtml|date=2010-12-18|access-date=2011-07-28}}</ref>
