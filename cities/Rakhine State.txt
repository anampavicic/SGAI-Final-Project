Situated on the western coast, it is bordered by [[Chin State]] to the north, [[Magway Region]], [[Bago Region]] and [[Ayeyarwady Region]] to the east, the [[Bay of Bengal]] to the west and the [[Chittagong Division]] of [[Bangladesh]] to the northwest. It is located approximately between latitudes 17°30' north and 21°30' north and longitudes 92°10' east and 94°50' east. The [[Arakan Mountains]] or [[Rakhine Yoma]] separated Rakhine State from central Burma from North to South. Off the coast of Rakhine State there are some fairly large islands such as [[Ramree Island|Ramree]], [[Cheduba]] and [[Myingun Island|Myingun]].

==History==
{{Main|Arakan|Arakan Division|History of Rakhine}}

[[File:Silver coin of king Nitichandra Arakan Brahmi legend NITI in front Shrivatasa symbol reverse 8th century CE.jpg|thumb|Silver coin of king [[Nitichandra]], Arakan. [[Brahmi]] legend "NITI" in front, [[Shrivatasa]] symbol on the reverse. 8th century CE.]]

The history of the region of [[Arakan]] (now renamed Rakhine) State can be roughly divided into seven parts. The first four divisions and the periods are based on the location of the centre of power of the main polities in the northern Rakhine region, especially along the Kaladan River. Thus, the history is divided into the [[Dhanyawadi]], [[Waithali]], [[Laymro]] and [[Mrauk U]]. Mrauk U was conquered by the [[Konbaung dynasty]] of Burma in 1784–85, after which Rakhine became part of the Konbaung kingdom of Burma. In 1824, the first Anglo-Burmese war erupted and in 1826, Rakhine (alongside [[Tanintharyi Region|Tanintharyi]]) was ceded to the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] as [[war reparations]] by the Burmese. Rakhine thus became part of the province of Burma in [[Company rule in India|British India]]. In 1948, Burma was given independence and Rakhine became part of the newly independent state.

===Independent kingdom===
Beginning in the 900s, the [[Bamar people|Bamar]] began migrating westward, crossing the [[Arakan Mountains]] and settling in what is now Rakhine State.<ref>{{Citation |last=Charney |first=Michael W. |title=Religion and Migration in Rakhine |date=2021-08-31 |url=https://oxfordre.com/asianhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277727.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277727-e-414 |encyclopedia=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Asian History |publisher=Oxford University Press |language=en |doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190277727.013.414 |isbn=978-0-19-027772-7 |access-date=2022-09-11 |archive-date=11 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220911080446/https://oxfordre.com/asianhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277727.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277727-e-414 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":20">{{Cite journal |last1=Ware |first1=Anthony |last2=Laoutides |first2=Costas |date=2018-10-01 |title=Rakhine–Burman Narratives: 'Independence', 'Unity', 'Infiltration' |url=https://academic.oup.com/book/32301/chapter/268523789 |language=en |doi=10.1093/oso/9780190928865.003.0004 |access-date=22 September 2022 |archive-date=22 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220922052645/https://academic.oup.com/book/32301/chapter/268523789 |url-status=live }}</ref> By the 1100s, they had consolidated control of the region, becoming a tributary state of the [[Pagan Kingdom|Pagan Empire]] until the 13th century.<ref name=":21">{{Citation |last=Druce |first=Stephen C. |title=Myanmar's Unwanted Ethnic Minority: A History and Analysis of the Rohingya Crisis |date=2020 |url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-981-32-9570-4_2 |work=Managing Conflicts in a Globalizing ASEAN |pages=17–46 |editor-last=Oishi |editor-first=Mikio |place=Singapore |publisher=Springer Singapore |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-981-32-9570-4_2 |isbn=978-981-329-569-8 |s2cid=211420005 |access-date=2022-09-13}}</ref><ref name=":20" /> Over time, these Bamar migrants formed a distinct cultural identity, eventually becoming the [[Rakhine people]] (also known as the Arakanese).<ref name=":20" /><ref name=":21" />

According to Rakhine legend, the first recorded kingdom, centred around the northern town of [[Dhanyawadi]], arose in the 34th century BCE and lasted until 327 CE. Rakhine documents and inscriptions state that the famed [[Mahamuni Buddha Temple|Mahamuni Buddha image]] was cast in Dhanyawady in around 554 BCE when the Buddha visited the kingdom. After the fall of Dhanyawadi in the 4th century CE, the centre of power shifted to a new dynasty based in the town of Waithali. The Waithali kingdom ruled the regions of Rakhine from the middle of the 4th century to 818 CE. The period is seen as the classical period of Rakhine culture, architecture and Buddhism, as the Waithali period left behind more archaeological remains than its predecessor. A new dynasty emerged in four towns along the [[Lemyo River]] as Waithali waned in influence, and ushered in the Lemro period, where four principal towns served as successive capitals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

After its partial dominance by the Islamic [[Delhi Sultanate]] and [[Bengal Sultanate]], the final [[Kingdom of Mrauk U]] was founded in 1429 by [[Min Saw Mon]]. It is seen by the Rakhine people as the golden age of their history, as Mrauk U served as a commercially important port and base of power in the Bay of Bengal region and involved in extensive maritime trade with Arabia and Europe.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}Part of it, along [[Bengal Subah]]'s [[Chittagong]], was later conquered by the Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]]. 
The country steadily declined from the 18th century onwards after its loss to the [[Mughal Empire]]. Internal instability, rebellion and dethroning of kings were very common. The Portuguese, during the era of their greatness in Asia, gained a temporary establishment in Arakan.<ref name="EB1911">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Arakan|volume=2|page=315}}</ref><ref name="Phayre1841">{{cite book|author=Arthur P.

===Burmese rule===
On 2 January 1785, the internally divided kingdom fell to invading forces of the Konbaung dynasty. The Mahamuni Image was taken away by the Burmese Forces as war loot. Thus, an expansionist Burma came into direct territorial contact with territories of the British East India Company, which set the stage for future flaring of hostility. Various geopolitical issues gave rise to the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] (1824–26). As the image of Mahamuni had been taken as war loot by the Burmese, this time the huge bell of the temple was taken by the [[Presidency armies]] and awarded to an Indian soldier, Bhim Singh, a Risaldar in the 2nd Battalion of the [[Bengal Army]], for his bravery. This inscribed huge bell is still installed in a temple at village Nadrai near [[Kasganj]] town in present-day Kanshiram Nagar District of [[Uttar Pradesh]] India. In the [[Treaty of Yandabo]] (1826), which ended hostilities, Burma ceded Arakan alongside [[Tanintharyi Region|Tanintharyi]] (Tenasserim) to British India. The British made Akyab (now Sittwe) the capital of Arakan. Later, Arakan became part of the province of Burma of the [[British Raj|British Indian Empire]], and then part of [[Company rule in India|British Burma]] when Burma was made into a separate [[crown colony]]. Arakan was administratively divided into three districts along traditional divisions during the Mrauk U period.

=== British rule ===
Rakhine was the centre of multiple insurgencies which fought against British rule, notably led by the monks [[U Ottama]] and [[U Seinda]]. During the Second World War, Rakhine was given autonomy under the [[Japanese occupation of Burma]] and was even granted its own army known as the Arakan Defense Force. The Arakan Defense Force went over to the allies and turned against the Japanese in early 1945.  Rakhine (Arakan) was the site of many battles during the Second World War, most notably the [[Arakan Campaign 1942–43]] and the [[Battle of Ramree Island]].

===Burmese independence===

In 1948, Rakhine became a division within the Union of Burma, and the three districts became Arakan Division. From the 1950s, there was a growing movement for [[secession]] and restoration of Arakan independence. In part to appease this sentiment, in 1974, the socialist government under General [[Ne Win]] constituted "Rakhine State" from Arakan Division giving at least nominal acknowledgment of the regional majority of the [[Rakhine people]].

===2010 onwards (after 2008 constitution)===
Since 2010, Rakhine state has had two chief ministers: Hla Maung Tin and Major General Maung Maung Ohn.
Hla Maung Tin ( January 2011 – 20 June 2014) was an elected Rakhine [[State and Region Hluttaws|State Hluttaw]] member representing USDP from [[Ann Township]] in 2010 general election.  He resigned from the post after recurrent intense inter-communal conflicts between Muslims and Rakhine ethnic groups in 2012–14.<ref>[http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/11519-rakhine-state-chief-minister-resigns/11519-rakhine-state-chief-minister-resigns Rakhine State Chief Minister resigns] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621065601/http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/11519-rakhine-state-chief-minister-resigns/11519-rakhine-state-chief-minister-resigns |date=21 June 2014 }}</ref> In 2014, he was replaced by Major General Maung Maung Ohn (30 June 2014 – present). Ohn was Deputy Minister for Border Affairs and head of the Rakhine State's Emergency Coordination Center before he was named to become a military-appointed Rakhine State Hluttaw member by Election Commission on 21 June 2014. His appointment as Chief Minister was formalised on 30 June 2014 although Arakan National Party opposed it.<ref>[http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/11567-rakhine-state-receives-new-chief-minister/11567-rakhine-state-receives-new-chief-minister Rakhine State receives new Chief Minister] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626101651/http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/11567-rakhine-state-receives-new-chief-minister/11567-rakhine-state-receives-new-chief-minister |date=26 June 2014 }}</ref>

===2012 Rakhine State riots===
{{Main|2012 Rakhine State riots}}
The 2012 Rakhine State riots were a series of conflicts between [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] Muslims and [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]] Buddhists who are majority in the Rakhine State. Before the riots, there were widespread and strongly held fears circulating among Buddhist Rakhines (who were a large majority) that they would soon become a minority in their ancestral state.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://icg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/myanmar-the-politics-of-rakhine-state.pdf |title=Myanmar: The Politics of Rakhine State |date=22 October 2014 |website=International Crisis Group |page=14}}</ref> The riots finally came after weeks of sectarian disputes including the death of ten Burmese Muslims by Rakhines and murder of a Rakhine by Rohingyas.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-violence-idUSBRE85714E20120608 | title=Four killed as Rohingya Muslims riot in Myanmar: government | work=Reuters | date=8 June 2012 | access-date=9 June 2012 | archive-date=19 October 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019125758/http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/08/us-myanmar-violence-idUSBRE85714E20120608 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="PhilInquirer">{{cite news|last=Lauras|first=Didier|title=Myanmar stung by global censure over unrest|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/271174/myanmar-stung-by-global-censure-over-unrest|access-date=15 September 2012|newspaper=Agence France-Presse in the Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=15 September 2012|archive-date=16 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916154752/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/271174/myanmar-stung-by-global-censure-over-unrest|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 16 January 2018, thousands of Mrauk U residents [[Mrauk U riot|staged a protest]] after officials banned a memorial event to mark the 233rd anniversary of the end of the Mrauk U kingdom. Local police opened fire on the crowd, killing seven and wounding 12. Two speakers of the event-Aye Maung, a prominent Rakhine politician, was charged under section 17(1) of Unlawful Associations Act and Sections 121 and 505 of the Penal Code, which relate to high treason and incitement and Wai Hun Aung, a Sittwe-based activist, was filed with public mischief charges under the Penal Code. Eight rakhine youths who were wounded in the protest were detained and charged under Article 6 (1) for allegedly destroying government property and public asset.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/court-hear-arguments-sides-trial-8-injured-arakanese-protesters-aug-13.html|title=Court to Hear Arguments from Both Sides in Trial of 8 Injured Arakanese Protesters on Aug. 13|date=2 August 2018|website=The Irrawaddy|access-date=30 January 2019|archive-date=25 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125011445/https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/court-hear-arguments-sides-trial-8-injured-arakanese-protesters-aug-13.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/myanmars-rakhine-state-to-form-inquiry-panel-on-mrauk-u-crackdown-01262018162306.html|title=Myanmar's Rakhine State to Form Inquiry Panel on Mrauk U Crackdown|website=Radio Free Asia|access-date=30 January 2019|archive-date=30 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190130110709/https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/myanmars-rakhine-state-to-form-inquiry-panel-on-mrauk-u-crackdown-01262018162306.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2017, State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi and the [[Tatmadaw]] rejected national-level political dialogue, which was a mandatory step of the [[Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement]] (NCA), where regional stakeholders discuss suggestions at large-scale public consultations, the results of which are shared by representatives at the Union Peace Conference or 21st Century Panglong, to be held in Rakhine State. In February 2017, the [[Arakan Liberation Party]]—which is one of eight NCA signatories—proposed holding ethnic-based national-level political dialogue in Rakhine State, but Aung San Suu Kyi turned down the request, saying the ALP was not yet ready. The ALP made necessary preparations and submitted letters three times to request approval to hold the dialogue, but the government did not reply, and at the Joint Implementation Coordination Meeting (JICM) [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] again declined the request, citing sensitive issues involving the Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/daw-aung-san-suu-kyi-rejects-national-level-political-dialogue-arakan-state.html|title=Daw Aung San Suu Kyi Rejects National-level Political Dialogue in Rakhine State|date=27 April 2017|website=The Irrawaddy|access-date=30 January 2019|archive-date=30 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190130110533/https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/daw-aung-san-suu-kyi-rejects-national-level-political-dialogue-arakan-state.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/rakhine-leaders-abolish-political-dialogue-panel-citing-govt-interference.html|title=Rakhine Leaders Abolish Political Dialogue Panel, Citing Govt Interference|date=21 March 2018|website=The Irrawaddy|access-date=30 January 2019|archive-date=30 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190130082928/https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/rakhine-leaders-abolish-political-dialogue-panel-citing-govt-interference.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
[[File:Map of Rakhine (Arakan) State in Myanmar.png|thumb|280px|Map of the Rakhine State]]
Rakhine State consists of five districts, as below, showing areas and officially estimated populations in 2002:
* [[Sittwe District|Sittwe]] (12,504&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>; 1,099,568 people)
* [[Mrauk-U District|Mrauk-U]] (recently created out of Sittwe District)

Combined, these districts have a total of 17 townships<ref>[http://www.burmalibrary.org/docs6/MIMU001_A3_SD%20&%20Township%20Overview.pdf "Myanmar States/Divisions & Townships Overview Map"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203160828/http://www.burmalibrary.org/docs6/MIMU001_A3_SD%20%26%20Township%20Overview.pdf |date=3 December 2010 }} Myanmar Information Management Unit (MIMU)</ref> and 1,164 village-tracts. [[Sittwe]] is the capital of the state.

==Transport==
Few roads cross the [[Arakan Mountains]] from central Burma to Rakhine State. The three highways that do are the [[Ann, Burma|Ann]] to [[Munbra]] ([[Minbya]] in Burmese pronunciation) road in central Rakhine,<ref name="RS-Map">[http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-map/rakhine-map.htm "Map of Rakhine State"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427123007/http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-map/rakhine-map.htm |date=27 April 2011 }} Myanmar's Net</ref> the [[Toungup]] to [[Pamtaung]] road in south central Rakhine,<ref name="RS-Map" /> and the [[Gwa, Burma|Gwa]] to [[Ngathaingchaung]] road in far southern Rakhine.<ref name="RS-Map" /><ref>Köllner, Helmut and Bruns, Axel (1998) ''Myanmar (Burma): an up-to-date travel guide'' Nelles Verlag, Munich, Germany, p. 224, {{ISBN|3-88618-415-3}}</ref><ref>[http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/NLM-2001/enlm/June12.htm#(5) "Minister inspects roads and bridges in Rakhine State"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107004328/http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/NLM-2001/enlm/June12.htm#(5) |date=7 November 2005 }} ''The New Light of Myanmar'' 12 June 2001.

==Economy==
Rakhine is one of the poorest states in Myanmar .<ref name="veconomist" >{{cite news|title=The flow of Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh shows no sign of abating|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/10/daily-chart-13|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|date=19 October 2017|access-date=24 October 2017|archive-date=24 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024041543/https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/10/daily-chart-13|url-status=live}}</ref> Over 69% of the population live in poverty.<ref>{{cite news|title=Aung San Suu Kyi's ideas about curbing attacks on Rohingyas won't work|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21729015-development-cannot-occur-without-end-violence-not-other-way-round-aung-san-suu-kyis|access-date=16 September 2017|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|date=14 September 2017|archive-date=15 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915234206/https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21729015-development-cannot-occur-without-end-violence-not-other-way-round-aung-san-suu-kyis|url-status=live}}</ref>

Rice is the main crop in the region, occupying around 85% of the total agricultural land. [[Coconut]] and [[nipa palm]] plantations are also important. Fishing is a major industry, with most of the catch transported to [[Yangon]], but some is also exported. Wood products such as timber, [[bamboo]] and fuel wood are extracted from the mountains. Small amounts of inferior-grade [[crude oil]] are produced from primitive, shallow, hand-dug wells, but there is yet unexplored potential for petroleum and natural gas production.

Tourism is slowly being developed. The ruins of the ancient royal town [[Mrauk U]] and the beach resorts of [[Ngapali Beach|Ngapali]] are the major attractions for foreign visitors, but facilities are still primitive, and the transportation infrastructure is still rudimentary.

While most places in Myanmar have chronic power shortages, in rural states like Rakhine the problem is greater. In 2009, the electricity consumption of a state of 3 million people was 30 [[megawatt|MW]], or 1.8% of the country's total generation capacity.<ref name=xn>{{cite news | title=Myanmar Adds More Hydropower Plants in Western State | date=7 December 2009 | url=http://en.chinagate.cn/features/new_energy/2009-12/07/content_19020928.htm | publisher=Xinhua News | access-date=8 December 2009 | archive-date=27 April 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427133219/http://en.chinagate.cn/features/new_energy/2009-12/07/content_19020928.htm | url-status=live }}</ref> In December 2009, the military government added three more hydropower plants, Saidin, Thahtay Chaung and [[Laymro]]myit, at a cost of over US$800&nbsp;million. The three plants together can produce 687 megawatts, with surplus electricity distributed to other states and divisions.<ref name=xn/>

==Education==
{{See also|List of universities in Rakhine State}}

Educational opportunities in Myanmar are extremely limited outside the main cities of [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]].

==Health care==
The general state of [[health care in Myanmar]] is poor. The military government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country's GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=108&subsecID=900003&contentID=254167 |title=PPI: Almost Half of All World Health Spending is in the United States |date=17 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205231908/http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=108&subsecID=900003&contentID=254167 |archive-date=5 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/06/28_Burma.shtml |title=Burma junta faulted for rampant diseases |date=28 June 2007 |author=Yasmin Anwar |publisher=UC Berkeley News |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702123259/http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/06/28_Burma.shtml |archive-date=2 July 2012}}</ref> Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment. In general, the health care infrastructure outside of [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]] is extremely poor but is worse in remote areas like Rakhine State. The entire Rakhine State has fewer hospital beds than the [[Yangon General Hospital]].
