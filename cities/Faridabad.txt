Faridabad has a borderline [[semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSh'') just short of a dry winter [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cwa''). The city features the three typical Indian seasons – The "hot" or pre-monsoon season lasts from late March to mid-July and is typified by sweltering and arid conditions that begin very dry but later turn humid. The "wet" or [[Monsoon of South Asia|monsoon]] season is sweltering and often dangerously humid with frequent but erratic heavy rainfall. Following the retreat of the monsoon is the "cool" or winter season with warm and sunny weather producing by far the most comfortable conditions.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

It is approachable by road from [[Delhi]] from the Delhi – [[Mathura]] road. The ruins of the fortifications found in Anangpur village establish by an inference that it was built by Anangpal as part of the [[Lal Kot]] that was developed as the first city of Delhi in the 8th century.<ref name=Sharma>{{Cite book|last=Sharma|first=Y.D|title=Delhi and its Neighbourhood|work=Surjakund and Anagpur Dam|pages=100–161|access-date=5 September 2009|publisher=Archaeological Survey of India|location=New Delhi|year=2001|url=http://www.indiaclub.com/Shop/SearchResults.asp?ProdStock=8780|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030426012208/http://www.indiaclub.com/Shop/SearchResults.asp?ProdStock=8780|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 April 2003|quote=Page 100:Suraj Kund lies about 3&nbsp;km south-east of Tughlaqabad in district Gurgaon—The reservoir is believed to have been constructed in the tenth century by King Surjapal of Tomar dynasty, whose existence is based on Bardic tradition.

A path from the main village street will lead you into flat pastureland. Head for the small rocky hill ahead of you and climb over it. On the other side is another flat area, rather thickly covered in thorn trees. It is worth finding a way through them to the dam that straddles the gap between the two nearby hills. The dam is an impressive edifice 50&nbsp;m wide and 7&nbsp;m high built from accurately hewn quartzite blocks.---There is a passage for the egress of water at the level of the ground on the dammed side. The flat land across which you have walked is caused by centuries of silt deposits in the lake that once existed behind this dam. The land around has been very heavily quarried recently, so further archaeological finds are unlikely.}}</ref><ref name=anag>{{Citation |url=http://www.indiainfoweb.com/haryana/lakes/anagpur-dam.html |title=Anangpur Dam |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125185110/http://www.indiainfoweb.com/haryana/lakes/anagpur-dam.html |archive-date=25 November 2009 }}</ref>
