'''Nyeri''' is a town situated in the Central Highlands of [[Kenya]]. It is the county headquarters of [[Nyeri County]] and was the central administrative headquarters of the country's former [[Central Province (Kenya)|Central Province]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Kenya.html|title=Kenya|access-date=10 March 2016}}</ref> Following the dissolution of the former provinces by Kenya's new constitution on 26 August 2010,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/kenyas-new-constitution-signed-into-law--101632883/124592.html|title=Landmark Moment as New Kenyan Constitution Takes Effect|work=VOA|date=26 August 2010 |access-date=10 March 2016}}</ref> the city is situated about 150&nbsp;km north of Kenya's capital [[Nairobi]], in the country's densely populated and fertile Central Highlands, lying between the eastern base of the [[Aberdare Range|Aberdare]] ''(Nyandarua)'' Range, which forms part of the eastern end of the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Great Rift Valley]], and the western slopes of [[Mount Kenya]].

The city population, according to the 2019 [[Kenya Population and Housing Census]], was estimated at 140,338. However, the number is rapidly growing.<ref name="OpenData Kenya"/> There is, however, a significant population of primarily Government and corporate workers who ordinarily reside in Nyeri but who, during the census, choose to be counted in their areas of origin or the areas where their families are residents.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kenya Open Data|url=http://www.opendata.go.ke/search?tags=census|website=www.opendata.go.ke|language=en-us|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref> The town has a relatively low cost of living in comparison to Nairobi and other major urban centres in Kenya.

Nyeri hosts the tomb of [[Robert Baden-Powell]], the founder of the Scout movement. It is also the home town of the late Nobel laureate Wangari Maathai. The town is also the home of the [[Dedan Kimathi University of Technology]] (DeKUT), founded by the local community in the early 1970s as an institute of technology, and converted into a fully fledged university in 2012.

== History ==
[[File:Kenya-relief-map-towns.jpg|thumb|450px|Nyeri was the headquarters of Kenya's former Central Province, and is now the largest city in, and new headquarters of the new Nyeri County (click to enlarge map).]]

Towards the end of 1902, as the British were establishing their colonial presence, [[Richard Meinertzhagen]] marched a strong military column meeting spirited resistance from the native [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] warriors led by Wangombe Wa Ihura. The Kikuyu were eventually defeated.<ref name="S. Wachira, S. Muteithia Kibira p. 18">S. Wachira, S. Muteithia Kibira, ''Nyeri Showcase'', Acken media, Nairobi, 2004; p. 18</ref> After Meinertzhagen's victory, a decision was reached to site a British post close to a little hill on the slopes of Mt. Kenya. The Kikuyu called the hill ''Kia-Nyiri'' while their [[Maasai people|Maasai]] neighbours called the hill ''Na-aier.'' The post took its name from the little hill. On 18 December 1902, Nyeri was founded.<ref name="S. Wachira, S. Muteithia Kibira p. 18"/>

Shortly after the establishment of the post, a trickle of European settlers and missionaries and Indian merchants began to migrate into Nyeri and the surrounding areas. The city soon burgeoned into a trading centre for white settler farmers who produced cattle, wheat and coffee. The city became particularly associated with the [[Happy Valley set]] in the first half of the twentieth century. The Nyeri Golf Club, The White Rhino Hotel, [[Outspan Hotel]], and the Aberdare Country Club at the nearby Mweiga township are relics of those colonial days.

== Demographics and culture ==

=== Ethnicity and language===
The majority of Nyeri residents are members of Kenya's largest ethnic group, the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], with residents generally being known as "Nyeri Kikuyu".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kenya-information-guide.com/kenya-population.html|title=Kenya Population 2009 – Statistics, Distribution and Demographics by ethnicity|access-date=10 March 2016}}</ref> The Kikuyu language is widely spoken, along with Kenya's National language, [[Swahili language|Swahili]] as well as Kenya's official language, English.

=== Religion ===
Following the national pattern of Kenya being a predominantly Christian country, Christianity is the main religion. The main Christian denominations are [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]-that hosts the Cathedral and the Archbishop's official residence-, [[Presbyterian]], [[Anglican]], [[Pentecostals]] and indigenous denominations, in that order. The older residents, who tend to attend the mainstream churches, are invariably more religious than the younger ones.  [[Muslims]], traditional African believers and [[Hindus]], in declining order, make up a small minority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kenya-information-guide.com/kenya-religion.html|title=Kenya Religion – Beliefs and Faiths Practiced in Kenya|access-date=10 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kenya-advisor.com/churches-in-kenya.html|title=Churches In Kenya: An Overview|access-date=10 March 2016}}</ref>

About 5&nbsp;km from the city Centre is the Mathari Mission settlement, a complex of several [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] buildings and institutions, established by [[Italian people|Italian missionaries]] at the beginning of the 20th century. The mission is composed of convents for nuns, schools, a teacher training college and other vocational colleges. It also hosts the Consolata Hospital and School of Nursing, which is staffed largely by nuns of the Consolata [[Mathari Hospital|order]].
Nyeri is also the place where Blessed Stephanie Nyaatha was laid to rest.

=== Education ===
[[File:DeKUT Catering Block.jpg|left|thumb|[[Dedan Kimathi University of Technology]]]]
In addition to its two home-grown universities, [https://www.dkut.ac.ke/ Dedan Kimathi University of Technology] and the recently upgraded [https://www.karu.ac.ke/ Karatina University College],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cue.or.ke/services/accreditation/status-of-universities|title=Commission for University Education|access-date=10 March 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707022546/http://www.cue.or.ke/services/accreditation/status-of-universities|archive-date=7 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Nyeri hosts satellite campuses of various Kenyan public universities such as [[University of Nairobi]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ems.uonbi.ac.ke/node/1228|title=Nyeri Extra Mural Centre – Department of Extra Mural Studies|access-date=10 March 2016}}</ref> [[Kenyatta University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ku.ac.ke/index.php/explore/all-themes/ku-campuses/87-about-ku/214-nyeri-campus|title=Nyeri Campus|access-date=10 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305054135/http://ku.ac.ke/index.php/explore/all-themes/ku-campuses/87-about-ku/214-nyeri-campus|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The National Police Training College is situated in Kiganjo, 10.8&nbsp;km from the city. There is a Medical Training College, a government nursing school, two polytechnic colleges, and several private and public secondary and primary schools such as Moi Nyeri Complex, Temple Road, DEB Muslim and Ngangarithi primary. The town is also home to the Nyeri National Polytechnic.[http://www.thenyeripoly.ac.ke/]. Other technical training colleges in the town include Tetu TVC, Mathira TVC and Kieni Esat TVC as well as many vocational  and technical training centers spread across the county. The Roman Catholic Church [[Archdiocese of Nyeri]] runs several schools, colleges, and hospitals. The town is also home to three national schools, Kagumo High School, Nyeri High School and the Bishop Gatimu Girls High School<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.consolatahospital.org/index.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830002524/http://www.consolatahospital.org/index.php |archive-date=30 August 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> in Nyeri. It is  the home to prestigious extra county schools in the nation like Othaya Boys High School and Mahiga Girls Secondary School. St. Mary's Boys Secondary School Nyeri is another top-performing high school located in Nyeri town.

== Economy ==
The largest formal employer in Nyeri, being until recently the administrative headquarters of the former Central Province, is the Government of Kenya. The local Municipal Council and utility providers are also significant employers. The  various sectors of the service industry, including retail, hospitality, banking, insurance, the charity industry, religious bodies especially the Catholic Church and professionals are also significant employers.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nyeri Real Estate Investment Opportunity|url=https://www.cytonn.com/topicals/nyeri-real-estate-investment-opportunity|website=www.cytonn.com|language=en|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref>

The main industrial plants are a Coca-Cola bottling plant, a water and fruit juice bottling plant, a number of tea and coffee processing factories, a milk processing and packaging factory owned and run by the Kenya Co-operative Creameries Ltd, and a number of maize millers. There is also a wide range of largely unsophisticated light industries, including motor vehicle repair garages, electronics repair shops, furniture workshops, tailoring shops, and bakeries. Attractive investment opportunities exist within the Nyeri industrial area of Kiganjo which is served by the newly refurbished railway line and has ample land for industrial expansion.<ref name="Online">{{Cite web|title=About Nyeri County -|url=http://www.nyerionline.co.ke/about-nyeri-county/|last=Online|first=Nyeri|website=Nyeri Online - Nyeri County Hotels {{!}} News, Attractions, Jobs|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref>

A major industry in Nyeri is [[farming]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetware.com/kenya/nyeri-ken-ctrl-nyeri.htm|title=www.planetware.com|website=planetware.com|access-date=11 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505141034/http://www.planetware.com/kenya/nyeri-ken-ctrl-nyeri.htm|archive-date=5 May 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> which is  mostly unmechanized.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Four Pillars Of Agriculture in Nyeri County.|url=http://www.nyeri.go.ke/four-pillars-of-agriculture-in-nyeri-county/|last=nyeri|website=COUNTY GOVERNMENT OF NYERI|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref>
The city urban area is actually part of the surrounding rural areas of greater Nyeri County, with farms within the municipality blending seamlessly into the rural area. The main [[cash crop]]s are [[Coffee]] and [[tea]], grown mainly by smallholders who are organized into quasi-private state-supported and supervised co-operatives or companies for farm input distribution, basic processing and marketing purposes.

The main food crops are [[maize]], the staple food in most of Kenya, legumes (especially beans and peas), tubers (mainly potatoes), and vegetables (especially tomatoes, cabbage, spinach and kale). Livestock, mainly dairy cattle, goats, sheep, and chicken are also widely kept. Food crop and livestock farming are also done by smallholders, with marketing and distribution of surplus produce (after farmers' own consumption) being done privately.<ref name="Online"/>

Tourism is also significant, as there are many tourist destinations nearby, including the Aberdare and Mount Kenya National Parks, and a number of hotels offering conference tourism and short upcountry holidays. The [[Nyeri Museum]] is located within Nyeri town, it houses cultural artifacts and Kenya's colonial history.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kws.org/kws/parks/parks_reserves/index.html |title=Kenya Wildlife Service – Overview Parks and Reserves |access-date=30 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026154250/http://www.kws.org/kws/parks/parks_reserves/index.html |archive-date=26 October 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Infrastructure ===
Nyeri has tarmacked roads, and the county and national governments are upgrading many of them.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Houses have drinking water on tap,<ref name="kenyaengineer"/> but sewage provision is through soak pits, pit latrines and septic tanks are still widespread.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} The city's topography allows nature and gravity to take care of most of the city's storm water drainage.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

Phone services, especially mobile telephony, and internet services are widely available. A fibre optic cable network linking the city to offshore submarine cables recently{{when|date=September 2019}} reached Kenya's coast.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

=== Transport ===
[[File:Nairobi-Nyeri highway, Kenya.jpg|thumb|Nairobi-Nyeri highway]]
Nyeri is served by a reasonably well-maintained tarmac road network connecting it to [[Nairobi]], [[Nakuru]], [[Nanyuki]], [[Othaya]] and other surrounding towns. The newly built Kenol-Marua 4 lane super highway ends few kilometers from Nyeri town,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.nyeri.go.ke/|last=nyeri|website=COUNTY GOVERNMENT OF NYERI|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-24}}</ref> Most transportation of cargo to and from Nyeri is by road, although the city has a largely underutilized railway station at Kiganjo (about six kilometers out of city towards Nanyuki) on the branchline of the railway from [[Nairobi]] to [[Nanyuki]].

An airport and some airstrips serve the city: one at Mweiga (about {{convert|15|km|mi}} out of city towards Nakuru) and another at Nyaribo, off the Nanyuki – Naromoru highway. The main mode of public passenger transport to, from, and within Nyeri is by way of fourteen-seater minibuses ([[matatu]]), though un-metered salon car taxis are also widely used. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

=== Notable graves ===
[[File:Peacock, Nyeri.jpg|thumb|[[Peacock]] at [[Outspan Hotel]], Nyeri]]
[[File:Baden Powell grave1.jpg|thumb|[[Lieutenant-General (United Kingdom)|Lt.-Gen.]] [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Lord Baden-Powell]]'s Grave]]

Nyeri has many visitors to the [[Baden-Powell grave]], the resting place of [[Lieutenant-General (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Lord Baden-Powell]], a British commander in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] and the founder of the [[Scouting]] Movement, who once wrote "the nearer to Nyeri the nearer to bliss".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scouting.org.za/seeds/paxtu.html|title=Paxtu – B-P's home in Kenya|access-date=10 March 2016}}</ref> He and his wife, [[Olave Baden-Powell, Baroness Baden-Powell|Olave, Lady Baden-Powell]], [[Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire|G.B.E.]], are buried in the City cemetery. Baden-Powell had a cottage built, which he called "Paxtu".  He lived there until his death, and it is now a small museum; it stands in the grounds of the [[Outspan Hotel]]. Nyeri remains a place of pilgrimage for the worldwide Scouting and Guiding Movements, with members congregating in the city from time to time for various activities and functions.

There are also visitors to the Italian War Memorial Chapel at Mathari, built in 1952 by the Italian government in honour of [[Italian Royal Army]] soldiers, prisoners of war, and other internees, from the time of the [[Second World War]] who died in East Africa, including 69 African recruits to the Italian forces, mostly Somalis. Among those buried at Mathari is [[Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta]], Viceroy of [[Italian East Africa]], whose tomb is within the Chapel, in front of the altar.<ref>[https://www.nation.co.ke/counties/nyeri/Italian-War-Memorial-Church-World-War-II-soldiers/1954190-5209684-view-asAMP-cbuno1z/index.html Church built as memorial for Italian soldiers in World War II Thursday], at nation.co.ke, July 25, 2019, accessed 2 May 2020</ref>

The chapel is not used for regular worship, but a special [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] is celebrated every 2 November in memory of the fallen soldiers and those who died in captivity. Covering the walls of the main church building are memorials for the many Italian servicemen who died during the war. Each memorial is in the form of a small oblong plaque indicating the name of the soldier, the [[battalion]] he served in, and the place where he died.

Nyeri is also the burial place of hunter and conservationist [[Jim Corbett]], the author of [[Man-Eaters of Kumaon]] (1944), who also spent his final years in Paxtu, [[B-P]]'s cottage.

==== Mount Kenya ====
[[Mount Kenya]] and Nyeri hill are nearby, as well as the Tetu hills 50&nbsp;km to the North East. About 20&nbsp;km from the city is [[Mount Kenya National Park]]. Mount Kenya is an extinct volcano lying astride the Equator. The mountain has two main snow-covered peaks – Batian (5&nbsp;200&nbsp;m) and Nelion (5&nbsp;188&nbsp;m). It is the highest mountain in the country and the second, after [[Kilimanjaro]], in Africa.

The mountain slopes are covered in forest, bamboo, scrub and moorland giving way on high central peaks to rock, ice and snow. Its U-shaped glacial valleys, rugged snow-capped peaks, Afro-alpine desert, thirty lakes and eight different natural forest types and a variety of wildlife species make it a convergence of natural attractions. The wildlife found in the park include [[giant forest hog]], [[tree hyrax]], [[white-tailed mongoose]], [[black leopard]], [[Bongo (antelope)|mountain bongo]], [[elephant]], [[black rhino]], [[suni]], [[black-fronted duiker]], [[mole-rat]] and over 130 species of birds.<ref name="KWS">{{Cite web |url=http://www.kws.org/kws/parks/parks_reserves/MKNP.html |title=Kenya Wildlife Service – Mount Kenya National Park |access-date=30 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110202153/http://www.kws.org/kws/parks/parks_reserves/MKNP.html |archive-date=10 January 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Activities taking place in the park include game drives, nature walks, mountain climbing, wildlife viewing, camping and cave exploration.

==== The Aberdares ====
About fifteen kilometers out of Nyeri on the opposite side to Mt. Kenya is the [[Aberdare National Park]]. The [[Aberdare Range|Aberdares]] is an old volcanic mountain range with lower peaks due to a longer period of erosion. It offers views of Mount Kenya to the east and the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Great Rift Valley]] to the west. Its unusual vegetation, rugged terrain, deep ravines cutting through its forested eastern and western slopes, clear water streams and waterfalls combine to create an area of great scenic beauty.<ref name="ReferenceA">Michael Hodd "East Africa handbook: the travel guide"  Pages 127–130 {{ISBN|1-900949-65-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-900949-65-1}}</ref> Its major attractions include the Lesatima and Kinangop peaks and many waterfalls, including the magnificent Karuru falls which drop 272 meters, Zaina falls which drop about 140 meters<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-waterfalls.com/waterfall.php?num=196|title=Karuru Falls – World Waterfall Database|access-date=10 March 2016}}</ref> and the Gura Falls which drop 305 meters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-waterfalls.com/waterfall.php?num=129|title=Gura Falls – World Waterfall Database|access-date=10 March 2016}}</ref><ref>Michael Hodd "East Africa handbook: the travel guide" Page 131 {{ISBN|1-900949-65-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-900949-65-1}}</ref>

The park is home to many endangered species including the rare bongo, giant forest hog, packs of the now very rare wild dogs, and endemic mole-rat and mole shrew. Other game include a large population of black rhino, leopard servile, endemic bird species, reptiles and insects.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Activities include game drives and nature walks. Both brown and rainbow trout abound in the cool mountain streams. Within the park, lodges near watering holes offer close proximity night game viewing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kilimanjaro.com/kenya/aberdare.htm|title=Kenya Parks and Reserves: Aberdare|access-date=10 March 2016}}</ref> It was at [[Treetops Hotel|Treetops Lodge]] that The Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh (now [[Elizabeth II]]) was advised of the death of her father while on a honeymoon retreat, and her own ascent to the throne.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.go.ke/default.nsf/news1/C09E6BE6E5D4930643256B66002FC07B?opendocument&l=1|title=Kenya Tourist Board: KENYA'S CROWNING GLORY|website=tourism.go.ke|access-date=11 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725165255/http://www.tourism.go.ke/default.nsf/news1/C09E6BE6E5D4930643256B66002FC07B?opendocument&l=1|archive-date=25 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> The park is also known for the Kimathi hideouts, the [[Mau-Mau Cave]]s, and the Kimathi "post office" where agents used to drop messages for [[Mau Mau rebellion|Mau Mau]] fighters during the guerrilla wars for Kenyan independence.

==== Private ranches ====
Close to the city are several privately owned ranches, many of which also serve as private wildlife sanctuaries like [[Solio Ranch]], Ol Pejeta Conservancy, and [[Lewa Wildlife Conservancy]]. Many higher-end tourists stay at these ranches, including celebrities such as [[Bill Gates]].<ref>Cyrus Kinyungu, Cyrus [http://www.bushdrums.com/news/index.php?shownews=279 "Simple lodge that won the heart of richest man"],''Bushdrums News'', 30 August 2006.
