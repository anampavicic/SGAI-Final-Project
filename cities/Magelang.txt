'''Magelang''' ({{Langx|jv|ꦩꦒꦼꦭꦁ}}) is one of six cities in [[Central Java|the Central Java]] Province of [[Indonesia]] that are administratively independent of the regencies in which they lie geographically. Each of these cities is governed by a mayor rather than a [[Subdivisions of Indonesia#Regency and City|''bupati'']]. Magelang City covers an area of 18.56&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and had a population of 118,227 at the 2010 census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://magelangkota.bps.go.id/statictable/2019/11/25/371/penduduk-akhir-tahun-di-kota-magelang-2010-2019.html|title=Penduduk Akhir Tahun di Kota Magelang, 2010-2019|work=Statistics Indonesia - Magelang City|access-date=2021-10-11|date=2020-11-10}}</ref> and 121,526 at the 2020 census;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as at mid-2023 was 122,150 (comprising 60,615 males and 61,535 females).<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Magelang Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.3371)</ref> It is geographically located in the middle of the [[Magelang Regency]], between [[Mount Merbabu]] and [[Mount Sumbing]] in the south of the province, and lies 43&nbsp;km north of [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], 15&nbsp;km north of [[Mungkid]] and 75&nbsp;km south of [[Semarang]], the capital of Central Java.<ref name=javatourism>{{cite web|author=javatourism.com - Lintang Buana Tours |url=http://www.javatourism.com/index.php?Page=619 |title=Magelang Information from |publisher=javatourism.com |access-date=2013-12-04}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Het raadhuis van Magelang TMnr 60046225.jpg|thumb|The Magelang town hall in 1925–1936]]

Magelang was established on 11 April 1907. Magelang was then known as a village called ''Mantyasih'', which is now known as ''Meteseh''.<ref name="sejarah">{{cite web|url=http://www.magelangkota.go.id/direktori/content/7/sejarah-kota-magelang|title=Sejarah Kota Magelang|access-date=2021-11-10|publisher=Government of Magelang City|language=id|date=2017-11-26}}</ref>

There are three [[stele]]s of historical importance in Magelang, namely Poh, Gilikan, and Mantyasih, all of which are written on a plate of copper. ''Poh'' and ''Mantyasih'' were written under the rule of King [[Balitung]] of [[Mataram Kingdom]]. In those steles, the villages of Mantyasih and Glanggang were mentioned. They became Meteseh and Magelang respectively.<ref name="sejarah"/>

On the Mantyasih stele, it mentioned the name of King Watukura Dyah Balitung, as well as ''829 Çaka bulan Çaitra tanggal 11 Paro-Gelap Paringkelan Tungle, Pasaran Umanis hari Senais Sçara atau Sabtu'', which means [[Saturday]] [[Javanese calendar#Pasaran cycle|Legi]], 11 April 907. The village Mantyasih was made by the king as a tax-free village which was led by a ''patih'' (similar to [[Prime Minister|the Prime Minister]] nowadays). Also mentioned are Mount Susundara and Mount Wukir Sumbing which is now known as Mount Sindoro and [[Mount Sumbing]].<ref name="sejarah"/>

When Britain colonised Magelang in the eighteenth century, Magelang became the seat of the government and was made to the same level as a regency with Mas Ngabehi Danukromo as its first leader (Bupati). Mas Ngabehi Danukromo built [[Alun-alun|Alun-Alun]] ([[town square]]), bupati residence, and a [[mosque]]. Magelang became the capital of ''Karesidenan Kedu'' in 1818.<ref name="sejarah"/>

After the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] defeated the British, Magelang was made the center of the economy because of its strategic location. The Dutch government built a drinking water tower (known locally as ''Menara Air Minum'') in 1918 which provides the city with water. Electricity became available in 1927. The roads were remade using asphalt.<ref name="sejarah"/>

[[File:Coat of Arms of Magelang (1930).svg|thumb|left|200px|Coat of Arms of Magelang during Dutch colonial era, granted in 1930.]]
The city has historically been a military post, dating back to the [[Dutch East Indies]] colonial era. It subsequently acted as an army stronghold for Indonesian pro-independence movements against the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government during the [[Resistance movement|resistance]] period. It is a host of two military landmarks: [[Indonesian Military Academy|The National Military Academy]], and the only military-associated school, [[Taruna Nusantara]].<ref name="javatourism"/>

Journalist Taichiro Kaijimura announced on 12 May 2007 the discovery of 30 Netherlands government documents submitted to the [[Tokyo tribunal]] as evidence of a forced mass prostitution incident by the Japanese army in 1944 in Magelang.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2007/05/12/national/files-females-forced-into-sexual-servitude-in-wartime-indonesia/|title=Files: Females forced into sexual servitude in wartime Indonesia|date=2001-05-12|access-date=2021-11-10|work=The Japan Times}}</ref>

After the [[Indonesian Declaration of Independence|independence of Indonesia]], Magelang became ''kotapraja'' (same level as a district) and then ''kotamadya'' (same level as a city).<ref name="sejarah"/>

==Geography==
[[File:Jalan alun alun magelang.jpg|thumb|Magelang Central Park Street View]]

Magelang City is a city which is located in a fertile agricultural area that is one of the most densely populated regions in Central Java. Magelang City has two borders; the western border is the [[Progo River]] and the eastern border is the Elo River.

==Administrative districts==
The city is divided into three districts (''kecamatan'') comprising 17 urban villages (''kelurahan'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magelangkota.go.id/potensi.php?id=3 |title=Kota Magelang |publisher=Magelangkota.go.id |access-date=2013-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916205013/http://www.magelangkota.go.id/potensi.php?id=3 |archive-date=16 September 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> These are listed below with their populations at the 2010 <ref>Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 2020<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021"/> Censuses, together with the official estimates as of mid-2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Magelang Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.3371)</ref> The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, the number of [[administrative village]]s in each district (all classed as ''kelurahan''), and their postcodes.

===Temples===
Magelang is the closest major town to [[Borobudur]], a ninth-century [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monument located about {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]]. Just 12&nbsp;km from the town centre is Candi Selogriyo, an eighth-century Hindu temple near the village of Candisari. The Canggal Temple (Gunung Wukir Temple), also located in the Magelang regency, has a [[Sanskrit]] transcription bearing the name of the first [[Mataram Kingdom]] ruler, [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]].<ref name="holing">{{cite journal |journal=Indonesia |title=In Search of "Ho-Ling" |author=W. J. van der Meulen| volume=23 |year=1977 |issue=23 |pages=87–112 |doi=10.2307/3350886|jstor=3350886 }}</ref>

===Rafting===
There is white water rafting on the Elo River, located in the district of Magelang. The Elo River disgorges from [[Mount Merbabu]], [[Mount Telomoyo]], and [[Mount Ungaran]], so it is not affected by the flow of volcanic material from [[Mount Merapi]]. The river is ideal for white water rafting because the characteristics of flow and flooding are relatively stable, so it is relatively safe to be forded in both the dry and rainy seasons. Running rafting chosen difficulty level (grade) maximum III + and suitable for families. The track has a length of about 12.5&nbsp;km and is reached in 2.5 – 3 hours of rafting.

===Museums===
A number of the town's buildings from the [[Dutch East Indies]] era have become heritage landmarks. The Karesidenan Kedu building is now known as ''Museum Kamar Pengabdian Diponegoro'', where Prince [[Diponegoro]] was arrested by the Dutch colonial government during the [[Java War]] (1825–1830).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://asosiasimuseumindonesia.org/anggota/129-museum-kamar-pengabdian-diponegoro.html |title=Museum Kamar Pengabdian Diponegoro |access-date=2021-11-10|language=id|publisher=Asosiasi Museum Indonesia}}</ref> The chair on which the Prince sat remains in the museum. A fingernail, believed to be Diponegoro's, remains on the arm of the chair. A statue in his honour stands in Magelang's town square.<ref name="javatourism"/>

===Jalan Pemuda===
Jalan Pemuda ("Youth Street") is Magelang's [[Pecinan]] ([[Chinatown]]). The one-way {{convert|1.5|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} road is the centre of business and includes shops, a minimarket, and restaurants. The road, running along a former railroad,<ref name="javatourism"/> is divided with a narrow section reserved for [[becak|rickshaw]]s.

===Alun-alun (town square)===
The [[alun-alun]] or town square is located in the city centre. The area has the Matahari and Gardena department stores, Magelang's only cinema, to the north, the Trio Plaza and the BCA tower; in the south, a police station, the BPD Bank building, and a [[Confucianism|Confucian]] temple along Jalan Pemuda. In the west, lies the city's largest mosque, locally known as ''Kauman''. Within the vicinity of the town square is a {{convert|15|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} water tower, and also a statue of [[Diponegoro]] riding a horse.<ref name="javatourism"/>

===Sports===
There are several [[sport venue|sports venue]]s in Magelang. In 2006, for example, a golf course was opened: the Borobudur International Golf and Country Club.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.borobudur-golf.com/en/about-2/ |title=About Us - Magelang Borobudur International Golf & Country Club |access-date=2021-11-10}}</ref> The [[Abu Bakrin Stadium|Abu Bakrin football stadium]] is located on Jl. Tidar, which is near the golf course. Besides, the Gedung Olah Raga "Samapta" is a popular sports venue in the sub-district of North Magelang. The area is being developed because of the plan to raise its status to the Sports Centre of Central Java. It is located in the east of the Progo River. [[Stadion Gemilang Kabupaten Magelang]] is located in the town of [[Blondo]]. It has a capacity of 15,000 and it is used mostly for football matches.

===Parks===
A 28-hectare park, ''Kyai Langgeng'', is located at Cempaka Street approximately one kilometer south of the city centre. Research is undertaken on rare plant species here. The park has a playground for children and their families. The river Progo is accessible from this park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indonesia-tourism.com/central-java/kyai-langgeng-park.html |title=Kyai Langgeng Park Tourism |publisher=Indonesia-tourism.com |access-date=2013-12-04}}</ref>

''Badaan'' park is located in Jalan Pahlawan (Pahlawan Road) and one of two parks in Magelang. The park is smaller than ''Kyai Langgeng'' and mostly regarded as a children's playground. There are animal statues within the park such as the rhino the animal used as its namesake, the elephant, and the giraffe. Hawkers sell a variety of ''[[bakso]]'' (Meatballs) in the vicinity of the park.

===Mount Tidar===
{{Main|Mount Tidar}}

[[Mount Tidar]] is located in Magersari, South Magelang, and is located within the complex of [[Indonesian Military Academy|the Military Academy (Akmil)]]. Here lies the remains of Syekh Subakir from [[Iran]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://borobudurnews.com/syekh-subakir-penumbal-tanah-jawa-yang-bersemayam-di-gunung-tidar/ |title=Syekh Subakir, Penumbal Tanah Jawa yang Bersemayam di Gunung Tidar|work=Borobudur News |date=18 September 2019 |access-date=2021-11-10}}</ref>

===Universities===
Although Magelang City is small city, it has several universities, colleges, and academies. At least, there are six universities located in Magelang City such as [[Indonesian Military Academy]] (Akmil), [[Muhammadiyah University of Magelang]] (Unimma), [[Tidar University]] (Untidar), STMIK Bina Patria, and Tirta Wiyata Engineering Academy (Akademi Teknik Tirta Wiyata) and the branch campus of the Health Polytechnic of the Ministry of Health, Semarang.

==Transportation==
[[File:Jalur 6.jpg|thumb|Jalur 6, one of Magelang's mass public transport]]

The main transportation which are operating in Magelang are cars, motorcycles, buses, paddy cabs, becak, and bicycles. Today, the most popular of them are cars and motorcycles. Even almost all of the households have a motorcycle as a means of mobility in daily activity. Then, public transportation is mainly using buses and cars.

Magelang used to have a railway track from Semarang to Yogyakarta passing at its centre (along Jalan Pemuda), but has since been redirected outside the city.<ref name="javatourism"/> Unfortunately, today the railway track does not function again. It was closed by the government due to the operational cost at that time.

Magelang does not have an [[airport]] and therefore relies on [[Yogyakarta]]'s [[Adisutjipto International Airport]], [[Surakarta]]'s [[Adisumarmo International Airport]], and [[Semarang]]'s [[Achmad Yani International Airport]]. Then, to reach the airport, especially Adisucipto, from Magelang takes about one hour by bus car, or taxi. But today the easier way to reach Adi Sucipto International Airport in Yogyakarta is by using [[Perum DAMRI|DAMRI]] buses that are specially operated to carry people from Magelang to Adi Sucipto Airport and its way back.

Following lava flows from [[Mount Merapi]] through the Kali Putih River in Gempol in 2011, the main road connecting Magelang and Yogyakarta has closed several times. An estimated Rp.64 billion ($7.3 million) project to build a bridge over the river, a 2.3 kilometer-long stream dredge and land acquisition is being built by the government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/11/09/new-stream-built-reduce-lava-impact.html |title=New stream built to reduce lava impact |date=9 November 2011}}</ref>

==Motto==
Magelang's motto is HARAPAN (in [[English language|English]]: Hope). It is made of "'''H'''idup", "'''A'''man", "'''RAP'''i", "'''A'''sri" dan "'''N'''yaman" (in English: living, safe, tidy, green, and comfort)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.suaramerdeka.com/harian/0509/22/ked04.htm |title=Kedu & Diy |publisher=Suara Merdeka |date=2005-09-22 |access-date=2013-12-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213194816/http://www.suaramerdeka.com/harian/0509/22/ked04.htm |archive-date=13 February 2012}}</ref>
