==Etymology==
The etymology of Kericho is uncertain. One theory suggests it that it was named after the region's first hospital, built by the colonial British at the start of the 20th century, referencing the Kipsigis word {{transliteration|sgc|kerichek}}, for medicine. Another theory proposes the name derives from a local medicine man called Kipkerich or from a Maasai chief, Ole Kericho who was killed in the 18th century by the Abagusii.<ref>{{Cite web |last=paukwastories |date=2023-03-29 |title=8 South Rift Town Names with Fascinating Roots |url=https://paukwa.or.ke/8-south-rift-town-names-with-fascinating-roots/ |access-date=2024-03-22 |website=Paukwa |language=en-GB}}</ref>
