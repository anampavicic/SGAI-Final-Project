'''Ozamiz''', officially the '''City of Ozamiz''' ({{lang-ceb|Dakbayan sa Ozamiz}}; {{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Ozamiz}}), is a 3rd class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Misamis Occidental]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 140,334 people making it the most populous city in Misamis Occidental.{{PH census|current}}

Although occasionally spelled as '''Ozamis''' in official sources like COMELEC,<ref>{{cite web|date=June 17, 2020|title=COMELEC Region X Field Offices|url=https://comelec.gov.ph/?r=ContactInformation/FieldOffices/CityMunicipalOffices/region10offices#misamisoccidental|access-date=October 18, 2021|website=Commission on Elections, Republic of the Philippines}}</ref> it is spelled as Ozamiz<ref>{{Cite web|title=REPUBLIC ACT NO. 321 : PHILIPPINE LAWS, STATUTES AND CODES - CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAWLIBRARY|url=https://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno321.html|access-date=October 18, 2021|website=www.chanrobles.com}}</ref> in Republic Act No. 321, the Ozamiz City Charter Act. In 2005, City Resolution 251-05 was passed to reiterate that it is officially spelled Ozamiz, not Ozamis.

==History==
[[File:Fuerte_de_la_Concepcion_y_del_Triunfo_marker.jpg|left|thumb|Fuerte de la Concepcion del Triunfo marker]]
The city of Ozamiz grew out of an old Spanish town called Misamis—a name believed to have been derived from the [[Subanen languages|Subanen]] word {{Lang|suc|kuyamis}}, a variety of coconut. Other unverified historical sources, however, suggest that the name Misamis came from the Spanish word {{Lang|es|Misa}} ([[Catholic Mass]]).

The old Spanish town grew in size due to the nearby Spanish garrison stationed at the stone fort named Fuerte de la Concepcion y del Triunfo. The fort was constructed some time in 1756 in order to attempt to combat the pirate activities originating in the nearby Lanao area. In 1850, the town of Misamis became the capital of the District of Misamis.

During [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|the American occupation]], the territory was reduced when [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Francis Burton Harrison]] issued ''[[Executive order (Philippines)|Executive Order]] No. 61, series of 1920''; the ''[[barrio]]s'', which was once part of the former municipality of ''Loculan'', were separated and organized into new municipalities of [[Clarin, Misamis Occidental|Clarin]] and [[Tudela, Misamis Occidental|Tudela]].<ref>{{cite book |date=1921 |title=Executive orders and proclamations (1920) |url=https://archive.org/details/ExecutiveOrdersNos.165-1920 |location=[[Manila]] |publisher=Bureau of Printing |pages=98–100 |access-date=March 11, 2024 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref>

In October 1942, [[Wendell Fertig]] established the command headquarters of the growing guerrilla resistance to the Japanese occupation of Mindanao in the Spanish fort in the city. His headquarters was abandoned June 26, 1943, due to a large Japanese attack.<ref>Kent Holmes, ''Wendell Fertig and His Guerrilla Forces in the Philippines: Fighting the Japanese Occupation, 1942-1945'' (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland & Co., 2015), p. 43.</ref> Until the end of the war, the Japanese occupied this fort. During the Japanese occupation of Misamis in [[World War II]], the "Cotta" was garrisoned by a contingent of Japanese who dug foxholes near or under the walls. This undermining of walls later led to the destruction of the southwest bastion in the earthquake of 1955.<ref name="auto1"/>

After the war, Misamis became a chartered city by virtue of Republic Act 321 on July 16, 1948. This also renamed Misamis to Ozamiz after a hero [[José Ozámiz]] who hailed from the province of Misamis Occidental and who at one time also served as its governor and congressional representative of the Lone District of Misamis Occidental, a delegate to the 1935 Constitutional Convention that resulted in the creation of the 1935 Constitution for the Philippine Commonwealth Government. In 1941, José Ozámiz was elected to the Philippine Senate.

== Geography ==
Ozamiz is located on the east coast of [[Misamis Occidental]]. It is nearby the [[Zamboanga del Sur]] and [[Zamboanga del Norte]] provinces to the west, and [[Lanao del Norte]] is across the [[Panguil Bay]]. 

It is bordered by [[Tangub]] to the south and [[Clarin, Misamis Occidental|Clarin]] to the north. Ozamiz is {{Convert|52|km|sp=us}} from [[Maria Cristina Falls]], the main source of hydroelectric power in [[Mindanao]].

[[Fuerte de la Concepcion y del Triunfo]], also known as Cotta Fort, is a fort built in 1756 by Father José Ducos to serve as a Spanish outpost in the area. On the outside wall of the fort is an outdoor shrine dedicated to the [[Blessed Virgin of Cotta|Nuestra Señora de la Immaculada Concepción y del Triunfo de la Cruz de Migpangi]], locally known as the "Birhen sa Cotta" ({{literal translation|Virgin of the Fort}}). The [[Relief|bas relief]] of the Virgin is believed to be miraculous and has been a pilgrimage destination. In 2002, the fort was renovated and restored to its original design.

Bukagan Hill is located in Barangay Malaubang. There are four great bells at the top of Bukagan Hill, named "St. Peter", "St. Marien", "St. Joseph", and "St. Michael". They were originally purchased by Bishop Patrick Cronin, D.D., for the Metropolitan Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. However, the bells weigh 7 tons and were found to be too heavy and too large for the cathedral's belfry. Given the recent costs of installing an organ at the cathedral, it was commonly thought that the installation of the bells would prove too expensive but, through the efforts of then City Mayor Fernando T. Bernad and Jesus Y. Varela, the bells were finally given a place at Bukagan Hill, and were officially inaugurated on July 16, 1948.<ref>"The February Revolution and Other Reflections", by Miguel Bernad, S.J, 1986.</ref>

Naomi's Botanical Garden and Tourist's Inn sits on a 12-hectare property. The garden features a variety local and imported tropical flowers, plants, and fruit trees. The hotel has fully air-conditioned private rooms, and is home to a variety of amenities, including function halls, a tennis court, a golf range, a ceramics factory, and a bakery.

Mt. Malindang Golf and Country Club is a pre-war army facility converted into a golf course located in Bagakay, at the foot of Mount Malindang.

The Immaculate Conception Pipe Organ, found in the choir loft of the Metropolitan Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, is the only existing pipe organ in Mindanao, and one of only a few anywhere in the Philippines. It was Father Sean Lavery, an Irish-Columbian priest in charge of music at the cathedral, who first thought of the idea of an organ at Immaculate Conception. Funds were raised through donations and a musical extravaganza, organized by the parish, to buy the pipe organ. Father Lavery requested the aid of a German priest, Father Herman Schablitzki S.V.D., in designing the organ. Father Schatblitzki visited Ozamiz to take measurements to give to the organ builders back in Germany. Father Schablitzki himself, assisted by one carpenter and one electrician, assembled the organ in six weeks, and it was completed on May 31, 1967. It was inaugurated on July 16, 1967, the feast day of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.<ref>"How An Entire City Built An Organ", by Bernad, Miguel S.J., Manila: Solidaridad Publishing House, 1968</ref>

The Metropolitan Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception was built from the ruins of a church destroyed in an earthquake in 1955. It was one of the earliest designs of nationalist art for architecture [[Leandro Locsin]]. His simple style of squares, circles, and half circles are evident throughout the external and internal designs of the church. Alterations to the façade of the cathedral were performed later. The cathedral is home to the wooden image of the [[Blessed Virgin of Cotta|Birhen sa Cotta]].

==Transportation==
===Air===
[[File:OzamizAirport.jpg|right|thumb|Ozamiz Airport]]
{{Main|Labo Airport}}

Ozamiz Airport, also known as [[Labo Airport]], was reopened July 5, 2007, 9 years after [[Philippine Airlines]] (PAL) stopped their original [[Fokker 50]] and [[Short 360|Sunriser]] plane operation at the airport. The inability of the airport to accommodate jet planes due to its short runway led to its closure. [[Air Philippines]] (a subsidiary airline of PAL) was the first airline that used [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] in Manila, using a [[B737-200]], the first jet plane to land at the airport. [[PAL Express]], another PAL subsidiary, then made direct flights to [[Mactan–Cebu International Airport]] again using their [[Bombardier Dash 8|Bombardier Q400]].

PAL's competitor, [[Cebu Pacific Air]], later started serving Ozamiz with their first flight to Cebu on November 10, 2008, using their brand-new [[ATR72-500]]. Due to high passenger and cargo demand, Cebu Pacific launched its Manila route with their [[Airbus A319]], while PAL took over Air Philippine's service to Manila using their Airbus A319s on June 16, 2009.

When Air Philippines rebranded as [[Airphil Express]] (now PAL Express), it relaunched its Ozamiz to Manila service on August 18, 2011, using their [[Airbus A320]]. It then forced Cebu Pacific to change its aircraft that had previously served Ozamiz Airport, replacing all of their ATR72-500s with Airbus A319s and Airbus A320s. Despite fierce competition between PAL and Cebu Pacific, PAL ended their operations in Ozamiz on March 25, 2012, leaving their affiliate PAL Express to compete with Cebu Pacific. Since then, the competition between PAL Express and Cebu Pacific became a duopoly serving the airport.

Ozamiz Airport will undergo a [[Philippine peso|P]]300 million expansion and development project. The project will consist of the installation of runway lights, the extension of runway from its current of length 1.9&nbsp;km to 2.1&nbsp;km, and the construction of a new passenger terminal building.<ref>{{Cite news|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|url=http://business.inquirer.net/216995/7-airports-up-for-rehab-expansion|title=7 airports up for rehab, expansion|last=Camus|first=Miguel R.|access-date=July 31, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Property&title=tieza-sets-ozamiz-park-project&id=112075|title=TIEZA sets Ozamiz park project|work=BusinessWorld|language=en-US|access-date=July 31, 2017}}</ref>
