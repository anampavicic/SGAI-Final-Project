In July 2020, as part of the reform of administrative divisions in Ukraine, Horlivka was made the administrative center of [[Horlivka Raion]]. This new status is not recognized by the pro-Russian occupation authorities.

=== Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
On 15 September 2022, the [[Main Directorate of Intelligence (Ukraine)|Intelligence Directorate]] under the [[Ministry of Defence (Ukraine)|Ukrainian Ministry of Defence]] reported that the occupying Russian forces were tasked with conscripting an additional 6,000 local residents. This, combined with previous conscription campaigns, and residents fleeing the city, left Horlivka near devoid of a male population of military age.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Male Population almost Extinct in Horlivka due to 'Mobilization' to Occupying Army |url=https://gur.gov.ua/en/content/v-horlivtsi-vnaslidok-mobilizatsii-do-okupatsiinoi-armii-praktychno-ne-zalyshylos-cholovikiv.html |access-date=6 January 2023 |website=gur.gov.ua}}</ref>

==Infrastructure and environment==
Despite the [[fall of communism]] a statue of Lenin still stands in a central square bearing his name. Horlivka is well served by CNG-buses (see [[Natural gas vehicle]]), but much of the city's Soviet-era infrastructure shows signs of deterioration. By contrast, a number of modern shops and a new cathedral (completed 2014) in the town center indicate some rejuvenation.

On the eastern side of Horlivka there is an abandoned chemical plant which used to produce toxic explosives and has been reported to be in a dangerous condition.<ref>{{Cite journal | title= Journal of Health & Pollution | doi=10.5696/2156-9614.1.2.2| doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url= http://danger.in.ua/en/dbsearch/56.html | title= 2012-01-03 Chernobyl of Gorlivka | url-status= dead | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140101135658/http://danger.in.ua/en/dbsearch/56.html | archive-date=1 January 2014 }}</ref> Mining activity has resulted in large [[spoil tip]]s being visible around the city, but a [[tree planting]] project and ongoing forestry maintenance has revitalised an area to the north.
