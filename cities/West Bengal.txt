{{Main|Names of Bengal}}

From a [[phytogeographic]] viewpoint, the southern part of West Bengal can be divided into two regions: the [[Gangetic plain]] and the [[littoral]] mangrove forests of the Sundarbans.<ref name=Mukherji>{{cite book |last=Mukherji |first=S.J. |year=2000 |title=College Botany Vol. III: (chapter on Phytogeography) |publisher=New Central Book Agency |location=Calcutta |pages=345–365}}</ref> The alluvial soil of the Gangetic plain, combined with favourable rainfall, makes this region especially fertile.<ref name=Mukherji /> Much of the vegetation of the western part of the state has similar species composition with the plants of the [[Chota Nagpur Plateau|Chota Nagpur plateau]] in the adjoining state of Jharkhand.<ref name=Mukherji /> The predominant commercial tree species is ''Shorea robusta'', commonly known as the [[sal tree]]. The coastal region of [[Purba Medinipur]] exhibits coastal vegetation; the predominant tree is the ''[[Casuarina]]''. A notable tree from the Sundarbans is the ubiquitous ''sundari'' (''Heritiera fomes''), from which the forest gets its name.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/452 |title=Sundarbans National Park |work=World heritage list |publisher=[[UNESCO World Heritage Centre]] |access-date = 4 March 2012 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120306224515/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/452 |archive-date = 6 March 2012}}</ref>

The distribution of vegetation in northern West Bengal is dictated by elevation and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. For example, the foothills of the Himalayas, the ''[[Dooars]]'', are densely wooded with sal and other tropical evergreen trees.<ref name=India123>{{cite web |url=http://www.webindia123.com/westbengal/land/forest.htm#N |title=Natural vegetation |access-date = 31 October 2006 |work=West Bengal |publisher=Suni System (P) Ltd |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060523204956/http://www.webindia123.com/westbengal/land/forest.htm#N |archive-date = 23 May 2006}}</ref> Above an elevation of {{convert|1000|m|ft}}, the forest becomes predominantly subtropical. In Darjeeling, which is above {{convert|1500|m|ft}}, temperate forest trees like [[oak]]s, [[conifer]]s and [[rhododendron]]s predominate.<ref name=India123 />

3.26% of the geographical area of West Bengal is protected land, comprising fifteen wildlife sanctuaries and five national parks—[[Sundarbans National Park]], [[Buxa Tiger Reserve]], [[Gorumara National Park]], [[Neora Valley National Park]] and [[Singalila National Park]].<ref name="fsiwbforest" /> Extant wildlife includes [[Indian rhinoceros]], [[Indian elephant]], deer, [[leopard]], [[gaur]], tiger and [[crocodile]]s, as well as many bird species.

== Government and politics ==
{{Main|Government of West Bengal|Politics of West Bengal}}
{{See also|Council of Ministers of West Bengal|List of Chief Ministers of West Bengal}}
West Bengal is governed through a [[parliamentary system]] of [[representative democracy]], a feature the state shares with other Indian states. [[Universal suffrage]] is granted to residents. There are two branches of government. The legislature, the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, who are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker's absence. The [[judiciary]] is composed of the [[Calcutta High Court]] and a system of lower courts. [[Executive (government)|Executive authority]] is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the [[Chief Minister of West Bengal|Chief Minister]] although the titular head of government is the [[Governor of West Bengal|Governor]]. The Governor is the [[Head of State]] appointed by the [[President of India]]. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the Governor. The Council of Ministers is appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly is [[unicameral]] with 295 [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|members]], or MLAs,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legislativebodiesinindia.gov.in/States%5Cwestbengal%5Cwesbengal-w.htm |title=West Bengal legislative assembly |access-date = 28 October 2006 |work=Legislative bodies in India |publisher=National Informatics Centre, India |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160313022603/http://legislativebodiesinindia.gov.in/states/westbengal/wesbengal-w.htm |archive-date = 13 March 2016}}</ref> including one nominated from the [[Anglo-Indian]] community. Terms of office run for five years unless the Assembly is dissolved before the completion of the term. Auxiliary authorities known as ''[[Panchayati raj in India|panchayat]]s'', for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs. The state contributes 42 seats to the [[Lok Sabha]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ceowestbengal.nic.in/news_pdf/gazette123.pdf |title=Notification: order no. 18 |author=Delimitation Commission |date=15 February 2006 |publisher=[[Election Commission of India]] |location=New Delhi |pages=23–25 |access-date = 11 February 2012 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110813092204/http://ceowestbengal.nic.in/news_pdf/gazette123.pdf |archive-date = 13 August 2011}}</ref> and 16 seats to the [[Rajya Sabha]] of the [[Indian Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/rsat_work/chapter-2.pdf |title=Composition of Rajya Sabha |work=Rajya Sabha at work |publisher=[[Rajya Sabha]] Secretariat |location=New Delhi |pages=24–25 |access-date = 15 February 2012 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305020442/http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/rsat_work/chapter-2.pdf |archive-date = 5 March 2016}}</ref>

[[Politics in West Bengal]] is dominated by the [[All India Trinamool Congress]] (AITC), [[Bharatiya Janata Party, West Bengal|Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), [[Indian National Congress]] (INC), and the [[Left Front (West Bengal)|Left Front]] alliance (led by the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] or CPI(M)). Following the [[2011 West Bengal state assembly election|West Bengal State Assembly Election in 2011]], the All India Trinamool Congress and Indian National Congress coalition under [[Mamata Banerjee]] of the All India Trinamool Congress was elected to power with 225 seats in the legislature.<ref>{{cite web |title=Statewise results – West Bengal |url=http://eciresults.nic.in/statewiseS25.htm |publisher=[[Election Commission of India]] |access-date = 13 May 2011 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110516052659/http://eciresults.nic.in/Statewises25.htm |archive-date = 16 May 2011}}</ref>

Prior to this, West Bengal was ruled by the Left Front for 34 years (1977–2011), making it the world's longest-running democratically elected [[communist]] government.<ref name="longcommu" /> Banerjee was re-elected twice as Chief Minister in the [[2016 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election]] and [[2021 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election]] with 211 and 215 seats respectively, an absolute majority by the Trinamool Congress.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/TMC-registers-strong-wins-in-Bengal-by-elections/article16675192.ece |title=TMC registers strong wins in Bengal by-elections |date=22 November 2016 |work=[[The Hindu]]|access-date=4 January 2018 |language=en-IN |issn=0971-751X|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124161817/http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/TMC-registers-strong-wins-in-Bengal-by-elections/article16675192.ece|archive-date=24 November 2016}}</ref> The state has one autonomous region, the [[Gorkhaland Territorial Administration]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=728097 |title=Gorkhaland Territorial Administration Agreement signed |publisher=[[Outlook (Indian magazine)|Outlook]] |date=18 July 2011 |access-date = 16 March 2012 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120603154514/http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=728097 |archive-date = 3 June 2012}}</ref>

In the 19th and 20th{{nbsp}}centuries, Bengali literature was modernised in the works of authors such as [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]], whose works marked a departure from the traditional verse-oriented writings prevalent in that period;<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-192109 |title=Bankim Chandra: The First Prominent Bengali Novelist |date=30 June 2011 |work=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |access-date = 12 December 2017 |language=en |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170906035834/http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-192109 |archive-date = 6 September 2017}}</ref> [[Michael Madhusudan Dutt]], a pioneer in [[Bengali theatre|Bengali drama]] who introduced the use of [[blank verse]];<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e_dA0RAwd4oC |title=Dictionary of Indian Biography |last=Buckland |first=C.

[[File:'Panchchura' temple, Bishnupur.jpg|thumb|alt= Panchura Temple made from terracotta |[[Shyam Ray Temple|Panchchura Temple]] in Bishnupur, one of the older examples of the terracotta arts of India.]]
There are significant examples of fine arts in Bengal from earlier times, including the terracotta art of Hindu temples and the Kalighat paintings. Bengal has been in the vanguard of modernism in fine arts. [[Abanindranath Tagore]], called the father of modern Indian art, started the Bengal School of Art, one of whose goals was to promote the development of styles of art outside the European realist tradition that had been taught in art colleges under the British colonial administration. The movement had many adherents, including: [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], [[Ramkinkar Baij]], [[Jamini Roy]] and Rabindranath Tagore. After Indian Independence, important groups such as the [[Calcutta Group]] and the Society of Contemporary Artists were formed in Bengal and came to dominate the art scene in India.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.contemporaryart-india.com/art_history_art_in_calcutta_bengal.php |title=contemporaryart-india – Art History: Bengal Region |last=Raychaudhuri |first=Baidehi Chatterjee and Roshmi |website=www.contemporaryart-india.com |access-date = 5 July 2017 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170507050409/http://www.contemporaryart-india.com/art_history_art_in_calcutta_bengal.php |archive-date = 7 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3h2KfXoOPYC |title=Atlas of World Art |last=Onians |first=John |date=2004 |publisher=[[Laurence King Publishing]] |isbn=978-1-85669-377-6 |language=en |page=304 |access-date=12 August 2020 |archive-date=2 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230202001150/https://books.google.com/books?id=O3h2KfXoOPYC |url-status=live}}</ref>

The capital, Kolkata, was the workplace of several social reformers, including [[Raja Ram Mohan Roy]], [[Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar]] and [[Swami Vivekananda]].

[[Pandal]]s are erected in various cities, towns, and villages throughout West Bengal. The city of Kolkata transforms Durga Puja. It is decked up in lighting decorations and thousands of colourful pandals are set up where effigies of the goddess Durga and her four children are displayed and worshipped. The idols of the goddess are brought in from [[Kumortuli]], where idol-makers work throughout the year fashioning clay models of the goddess. Since independence in 1947, Durga Puja has slowly changed into more of a glamorous carnival than a religious festival.
