'''Daqing''' ({{zh|c=|p=Dàqìng|t=大慶|s=大庆}}) is a [[prefecture-level city]] in the west of [[Heilongjiang]] province, [[People's Republic of China]].

Its population was 2,781,562 as of the [[2020 Chinese census|2020 census]], of whom 1,574,389 lived in the built-up (or metro) area in four out of the total of five urban districts: [[Sartu]], [[Longfeng District|Longfeng]], [[Ranghulu]] and [[Honggang]].

==History==
The region now known as Daqing Prefecture was a reasonably insignificant place until the [[Qing dynasty]], known only as an unsettled hunting ground of [[Dörbet Oirat]] tribes due to its wetland and prairies. The region began to grow slightly after the [[Russian Empire]] constructed the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] (KVZhD) through the area in 1898.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=zh:滨州铁路简介|url=http://www.hclx.net/Item/43563.aspx|script-website=zh:火车旅行网|access-date=17 July 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130221222702/http://www.hclx.net/Item/43563.aspx|archive-date=21 February 2013}}</ref> The railway has a station at Sartu in today's [[Sartu District]]. It was not until 1959 that oil was discovered in the region as part of the large scale oil exploration put into motion across the [[Northeast China Plain]].<ref name=1959discover/> 

The Daqing oilfield was discovered in the late 1950s, and drilling began in 1958. A town with the same name was founded in 1959 to house workers extracting oil and gas from the oilfield and to host industries which could take advantage of the energy and petrochemicals, shortly before the 10th anniversary of the founding of the PRC. The successful construction of the Daqing oil field despite harsh weather conditions and supply limitations became a model held up by the Party as an example during subsequent industrialization campaigns.<ref name=":032">{{Cite book |last=Meyskens |first=Covell F. |url= |title=Mao's Third Front: The Militarization of Cold War China |date=2020 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-1-108-78478-8 |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |doi=10.1017/9781108784788 |oclc=1145096137 |s2cid=218936313}}</ref>{{Rp|pages=52-54}} The project also delivered critical economic benefits because without the production of the Daqing oil field, crude oil would have been severely limited after the Soviet Union cut off supplies as a result of the Sino-Soviet split.<ref name=":032" />{{Rp|page=53}}

Original plans for Daqing included the development of a "new socialist mining district" (rather than a city) with families in which the husband would work in industry and the wife would work in agriculture.<ref name=":12">{{Cite book |last=Harrell |first=Stevan |title=An Ecological History of Modern China |publisher=[[University of Washington Press]] |year=2023 |isbn=9780295751719 |location=Seattle}}</ref>{{Rp|page=313}}

The name Daqing literally means "Great Celebration". On 26 May 1960, Anda City was established at former Anda town (today's [[Anda City]] in [[Suihua]] prefecture), administering Daqing oilfield area. Five months later, the administrative organs of the oilfield relocated in Sartu. On 23 June 1964, the city was established Anda special administrative region, with Anda county administering its surrounding area. 

The first two years of the [[Cultural Revolution]] resulted in major disruptions to [[Petroleum industry in China|China's petroleum industry]] and an oil shortage by 1967.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=159}} In March of that year, the [[People's Liberation Army]] was called to Daqing to maintain order so that oil production could proceed.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=159}} This made Daqing one of the first places brought under military control during the Cultural Revolution.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=159}} In May 1968, the Daqing [[Revolutionary committee (China)|Revolutionary Committee]] was established.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=159}} Iron Man [[Wang Jinxi]] became its vice director.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|pages=159-160}} The oil field continued to be a major driver of economic growth during the chaotic Cultural Revolution period.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=160}}

The Daqing Oil District became a city in 1980.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=200}} Its first master plan set a goal of growing Daqing into "a new industrial city" through a development strategy of "relative dispersion with several modest concentrations.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=200}} Academic Hou Li summarizes that as a result "new settlements became much more concerntrated. The three existing towns, thirty-four central villages, and 260 settlement points were restructured into six workers' towns, twenty-four central villages, and twenty-seven resident villages."<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=200}}

The city revised its master plan in 1989, setting a new goal of building an oil city centered in Saertu, Dongfeng, and Longfeng.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=200}} This plan shifted Daqing's [[Urban planning in China|urban planning]] focus away from decentralization to centralization.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=200}}

In 1990, the city received the top recognition in the Heilongjiang Province Science and Technology Awards.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=200}} In 1994, its population reached one million.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=200}} After the mid-1990s, urban expansion in Saertu was halted in order to provide more space for oil production.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=1}} Urban construction was instead transferred to East Town and West Town areas.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=1}}

Since its foundation, Daqing has been advocated as a model of good practice in industry and healthcare by the Chinese government.

===Learn from Daqing in industry===
The fact that [[Mao Zedong]] promulgated his [[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung|Supreme Directive]], ''Learn from Daqing in Industry'', in the 1960s reflects how important a role Daqing has historically played in industry in China.<ref name="The Industry Learns From Daqing">{{cite web |work= Chineseposters.net|title=The Industry Learns From Daqing...|url=http://chineseposters.net/posters/e12-604.php|access-date=April 30, 2011}}</ref> ''Learn from Daqing in industry'' ({{Zh|s=[[wiktionary:工|工]][[wiktionary:业|业]][[wiktionary:学|学]][[wiktionary:大|大]][[wiktionary:庆|庆]]|p=gōngyè xué dàqìng}}) was a [[slogan]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]] telling the people to use the city as an example for industrial production.<ref name="The Industry Learns From Daqing"/><ref>[[Jonathan Spence|Spence's]] ''[[The Search for Modern China]]''. 2nd Edition, pages: 563, 564, 605, 606, 619</ref>

The film ''[[Entrepreneurial Pioneers]]'' ({{lang|zh-hans|创业}}), made in the early 1970s, is a literary rendition of the history of Daqing. During the Mao era, Daqing's agricultural counterpart was [[Dazhai, Xiyang County|Dazhai]], a village in the hilly [[Xiyang]] county, [[Shanxi]] Province, for which Chairman Mao issued the directive ''[[Learn from Dazhai in agriculture|In agriculture, learn from Dazhai]]'', also in the 1960s.<ref name="Spence">Spence's "The Search for Modern China" 2nd Edition, p.562</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
Daqing is divided into 9 county-level divisions: 5 districts, 3 counties and 1 [[autonomous county]].

===Daqing spirit===
Generated by the history of the city, Daqing has a culture centering around the "Daqing Spirit, the Daqing People," which is said to represent deep personal commitment in pursuing national goals, self-sufficient and frugal living, and urban-rural integrated land use.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=3}} Daqing's urban-rural landscape was said to embody the ideal communist society described by Karl Marx because it eliminated (1) the gap between town and country, (2) the gap between workers and peasants, and (3) the gap between manual and mental labor.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=3}}

"Daqing Spirit, Daqing People" was the title of an April 20, 1964 article in ''[[People's Daily]]'' which extolled the success of Daqing oil field workers.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=148}} The most influential of many articles praising Daqing that appeared in state media around that time, "Daqing Spirit, Daqing People" was the first text to compare Daqing to [[Yan'an]], the revolutionary base area where the Communist Party re-grouped following the [[Long March]] before going on to win the [[Chinese Civil War]].<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=148}}

[[Wang Jinxi]] ({{zh|s=王进喜|p=Wáng Jìnxǐ}}, known as "Iron Man" Wang), a petroleum worker on the Daqing Oilfield who led No. 1205 drilling team, was honored as a national hero due to his contributions to the petroleum industry of China.

In order to illuminate the entrepreneurial history of Daqing and its people, several films were made by companies in China.<ref>[http://www.hktdc.com/info/mi/a/mpcn/en/1X074ADT/1/Profiles-Of-China-Provinces-Cities-And-Industrial-Parks/Daqing-Heilongjiang-City-Information.htm Profiles of China Provinces, Cities and Industrial Parks]</ref>
