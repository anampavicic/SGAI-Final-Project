== Modern history ==
In 1963, Gosam town of Yongin was incorporated by Anseong, which was still a county at the time.<ref>Alteration of cities/counties/districts(1962-11-21)</ref>{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} In 1983, Anseong 6 jurisdictions
Compulsory incorporation without the consent of the residents to district of Pyeongtaek.<ref>Laws concerning change of districts of city, county, district, town, township and Establishment of new towns(1983-1-10)</ref>{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}<!-- How can this be considered a reference? ~~~~ --> In 1998, Anseong was upgraded from county to city status.

It borders [[Pyeongtaek]]-si to the west, [[Yongin]]-si to the north, [[Icheon]]-si and [[Eumseong]]-gun to the east, and [[Cheonan]]-si, [[Chungcheongnam-do]] and [[Jincheon]]-gun, [[Chungcheongbuk-do]] to the south. It is located in the southernmost part of [[Gyeonggi-do]] and is adjacent to [[Chungcheong-do]] along with Pyeongtaek-si, so it serves as a gateway to the rest of the country. For this reason, in the past, it was counted as one of three major commercial centers in Korea with Daegu and Jeonju. At that time, Anseong was a bustling city. In particular, the 5-day market held on the 2nd and 7th of every month was one of the three largest markets in Joseon.
