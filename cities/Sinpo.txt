==Economy==
===Fishery===
It is an important base for fishing, with a recent government emphasis on [[aquaculture]].  The DPRK has created aquacultural cooperatives and a central aquaculture office in the city.

===Nuclear power===
====1980s====
In 1985 or 1986, the [[Soviet Union]] announced it  would build a [[Nuclear power in North Korea|nuclear]] power plant, in an effort to persuade North Korea to join the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]. According to [[South Korea]]n sources, the plant was to be located in the Sinpo District, and construction began in 1990, but later ended due to pressure from IAEA, and economic difficulties in the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sinpo|url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/dprk/facility/sinpo.htm|website=Federation of American Scientists|accessdate=16 April 2017|date=1 March 2000}}</ref>

====1990s====
In the 1990s, the Kumho area of Sinpo was the site of two planned reactors which were to have been built by the [[Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization]] (KEDO) with international support. The project was later cancelled by the [[United States]] in 2002, amidst claims of a breach in a 1994 agreement on North Korea's nuclear weapons programs.<ref name="SinpoPower">{{cite web|title=Shinpo, North Korea|url=http://www.power-technology.com/projects/shinpo/|website=power-technology.com|publisher=Kable Intelligence Limited|accessdate=16 April 2017}}</ref>

Preparation work on the site began in 1996, and a groundbreaking ceremony took place in 1997, with construction originally expected to be completed in 2003.<ref name="SinpoPower"/> Workers were removed from the area in January 2006, and the project was officially terminated in May that same year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Geumho-Jigu Light Water Reactor Site|url=http://www.nti.org/learn/facilities/768/|website=Nuclear Threat Initiative|accessdate=16 April 2017|date=30 September 2011}}</ref>

Sinp'o is reportedly close to the site of a severe railroad accident in 1995, with over 700 civilians killed. Those who died were passengers from the lower classes, packed into standing-room only cars. The survivors, mostly party elites and their relatives, were in safer cars at the front of the train.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Demick|first1=Barbara|title=Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea|date=2009|publisher=Spiegel & Grau|location=New York|isbn=978-0-385-52391-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/nothingtoenvyord00demi_0/page/139 139]–140|url=https://archive.org/details/nothingtoenvyord00demi_0|url-access=registration|quote=sinpo train accident.|accessdate=16 April 2017}}</ref>
