With a population of 372,348 (April 2023),<ref>[https://www.bochum.de/Referat-fuer-politische-Gremien-Buergerbeteiligung-und-Kommunikation/Statistik/Die-wichtigsten-Zahlen-zur-Bochumer-Bevoelkerung Statistik]</ref> it is the sixth-largest city (after [[Cologne]], [[Düsseldorf]], [[Dortmund]], [[Essen]] and [[Duisburg]]) in North Rhine-Westphalia, one of the most populous [[Germany|German]] federal states, and the [[List of cities in Germany by population|16th-largest city]] in Germany. On the Ruhr Heights ({{lang|de|Ruhrhöhen}}) [[hill chain]], between the rivers [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] to the south and [[Emscher]] to the north (tributaries of the [[Rhine]]), it is the second largest city of [[Westphalia]] after Dortmund, and the fourth largest city of the [[Ruhr]] after Dortmund, Essen and Duisburg. It lies at the centre of the Ruhr, Germany's largest urban area, in the [[Rhine-Ruhr|Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region]], the [[List of EU metropolitan areas by GDP|second biggest metropolitan region by GDP]] in the European Union, and belongs to the [[Arnsberg (region)|region of Arnsberg]]. Bochum is the sixth largest and one of the southernmost cities in the [[Low German]] dialect area. There are nine institutions of higher education in the city, most notably the [[Ruhr University Bochum]] ({{lang|de|Ruhr-Universität Bochum}}), one of the ten largest universities in Germany, and the Bochum University of Applied Sciences ({{lang|de|Hochschule Bochum}}).

==Geography==

===Geographical position===
The city lies on the low rolling hills of Bochum land ridge (Bochumer Landrücken), part of the Ruhrhöhen (highest elevations) between the [[Ruhr]] and [[Emscher]] rivers at the border of the southern and northern Ruhr coal region. The highest point of the city is at Kemnader Straße (Kemnader Street) in [[Stiepel]] at {{convert|196|m}} above sea level; the lowest point is {{convert|43|m}} at the Blumenkamp in [[Hordel]].

The terrain of Bochum is characterised by rolling hills that rarely have more than three per cent graduation. Steeper graduation can be found at the Harpener Hellweg near the Berghofer Holz nature reserve (3.4%), at Westenfelder Straße in the [[borough]] of [[Wattenscheid]] (3.47%), or at Kemnader Straße, which begins at the banks of the Ruhr in [[Stiepel]] ({{convert|71|m|abbr=on|disp=comma}}), and rises to its highest point in the centre of Stiepel ({{convert|196|m|abbr=on|disp=comma}}, a 5.1% increase).

The city extends north to south {{convert|13.0|km|abbr=on}} and {{convert|17.1|km|abbr=on}} east to west. The perimeter of the city limits is {{convert|67.2|km|abbr=on}}.

It is surrounded by the cities of (in clockwise direction) [[Herne, Germany|Herne]], [[Castrop-Rauxel]], [[Dortmund]], [[Witten]], [[Hattingen]], [[Essen]] and [[Gelsenkirchen]].

===Geology===
There is [[sedimentary rock]] of [[carbon]] and [[chalk]]. The geological strata can be visited in the former quarry of Klosterbusch in Querenburg and at the Geological Gardens in Wiemelhausen.

===Waterways===
The urban area is divided into the river [[Ruhr]] catchment in the south and the [[Emscher]] catchment in the north. The Ruhr's tributaries are the Oelbach (where as well a waste water treatment plant is established<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ruhrverband.de/index.php?id=340|title=Was sind PFT|website=Ruhrverband.de|access-date=11 June 2022}}</ref>), Gerther Mühlenbach, Harpener Bach, Langendreer Bach, [[Lottenbach]], [[Hörsterholzer Bach]] and the [[Knöselbach]]. The Ruhr in combination with upstream reservoirs is also used for drinking water abstraction. The Emscher's tributaries are Hüller Bach with Dorneburger Mühlenbach, Hofsteder Bach, Marbach, Ahbach, Kabeisemannsbach and Goldhammer Bach. The industrial developments in the region since the 19th century were leading to a kind of division of labour between the two river catchments, pumping drinking water from the Ruhr into the municipal supply system and discharging waste water mainly into the Emscher system. Today approximately 10% of the waste water in the Emscher catchment is discharged via the Hüller Bach.<ref>emscher:dialog in Bochum, planning process document, published by Emschergenossenschaft, April 16th 2002</ref> and treated in the centralized waste water treatment plant of the [[Emschergenossenschaft]] in [[Bottrop]]. The ecological restoration of the Emscher tributaries initiated by the Emschergenossenschaft started with the [[Internationale Bauausstellung Emscher Park]] in 1989.

===Vegetation===
The south of the city has woods, the best known of which are the {{Interlanguage link|Weitmarer Holz|de}}. These are generally [[Forest ecology|mixed forests]] of [[oak]] and [[beech]]. The occurrence of [[holly]] gives evidence of Bochum's [[temperate climate]]. 844 species of plants can be found within the city limts<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jagel|first=Armin|url=https://www.botanik-bochum.de/flora/Flora_Bochum_Jagel.pdf|title=Flora von Bochum|year=2021|pages=3}}</ref>

===Climate===
Bochum features an [[Oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''; [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Dobk'') characterized by cool winters and short warm summers. Extreme temperatures are uncommon. However, temperatures rising above 30&nbsp;°C (86&nbsp;°F) are to be expected on multiple days in summer and the climate station closest to the City did record a peak temperature of 40&nbsp;°C<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Klima Bochum|url=https://www.wetterdienst.de:443/Deutschlandwetter/Bochum/Klima/|access-date=2021-01-10|website=Wetterdienst.de|language=de}}</ref> (104&nbsp;°F) on July 25, 2019.

On the other extreme, freezing temperatures are common between mid-November and late March. In some years, however, frosts may occur as late as early May. Temperatures below −10&nbsp;°C are, especially in recent years, only seen on rare occasions. The city lies within the warmer extent of the 8a [[Hardiness zone|USDA plant hardiness zone]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=USDA-Karte der Klima- und Winterhärte-Zonen in Deutschland – Garten & Pflanzen News – GREEN24 Hilfe Pflege Bilder|url=https://green-24.de/forum/usda-karte-der-klima-und-winterhaerte-zonen-in-deutschland-t51878.html|access-date=2021-01-23|website=green-24.de}}</ref> (−12.2 to −9.4&nbsp;°C or 10 to 15&nbsp;°F). Some winters may pass without a frost below −5&nbsp;°C <ref>{{Cite web|title=Rückblick für Essen – WetterKontor|url=https://www.wetterkontor.de/de/wetter/deutschland/rueckblick.asp?id=55&datum0=26.12.2020&datum1=22.01.2021&jr=2021&mo=1&datum=22.01.2020&t=4&part=2|access-date=2021-01-23|website=Wetterkontor.de}}</ref>(data from the nearest active climate station). These comparably mild conditions in Winter permit the planting of plants that would either not be reliably hardy or not able to bloom throughout Germany like ''[[Trachycarpus]]'' palms, [[Buddleja davidii|Summer lilac]], ''[[Paulownia tomentosa]]'' and [[Rosemary]].

However, winters can be unpredictable with strong fluctuations in temperatures: In mid-February 2021, the city was affected by a severe cold spell bringing temperatures down to –15 degrees Celsius (5&nbsp;°F) accompanied by heavy snowfall which hindered traffic<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kiesewetter|first=Bernd|date=2021-02-07|title=Wintereinbruch in Bochum: Müllabfuhr wird nicht garantiert|url=https://www.waz.de/staedte/bochum/feuerwehr-bochum-warnt-vor-glaette-bitte-seid-vorsichtig-id231498079.html|access-date=2021-02-20|website=Waz.de|language=de-DE}}</ref> for multiple days. A week later, a temperature of 17&nbsp;°C (63&nbsp;°F) was recorded,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Rückblick für Essen - WetterKontor|url=https://www.wetterkontor.de/de/wetter/deutschland/rueckblick.asp?id=55|access-date=2021-02-25|website=Wetterkontor.de}}</ref> an increase of 32K.

The total precipitation of 815mm<ref name=":0" /> is distributed relatively evenly through most of the year but has a peak in winter and two minima in late spring and July, respectively.<ref name=":0" /> June shows a second peak in precipitation due to the [[Monsoon#Europe|return of the westerlies]] which leads to more thunderstorms being generated along frontal boundaries of Atlantic low-pressure systems. In recent years, the city was affected by summer and spring droughts. Thunderstorms are not uncommon in the warm season and can generate intense downpours and sporadically hail.

The city experiences little sunshine in winter with a minimum of 1,3h per day in December and a lot more in early summer and late spring with May featuring 7,5h per day. The total amount of sunshine per year is 1689h.<ref name=":0" />

Due to the cities northern latitude of 51°N, seasonal day-length variation is significant. The longest day of the year, June 21, features 16 h 38 min. of daylight while the shortest day of the year which is December 21 is only 7 h and 50 min. long.

Bochum dates from the 9th century, when [[Charlemagne]] set up a royal court at the junction of two important trade routes. It was first officially mentioned in 1041 as ''Cofbuokheim'' in a document of the archbishops of Cologne. In 1321, Count [[Engelbert II, Count of Mark|Engelbert II von der Marck]] granted Bochum a town charter, but the town remained insignificant until the 19th century, when the [[coal]] mining and [[steel]] industries emerged in the Ruhr area, leading to the growth of the entire region. In the early 19th century it was part of the [[Grand Duchy of Berg]], a client state of [[First French Empire|France]], then it passed to [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] following the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815, and in 1871 it became part of the [[German Empire]]. The population of Bochum increased from about 4,500 in 1850 to 100,000 in 1904. Bochum acquired city status, incorporating neighbouring towns and villages. Additional population gains came from immigration, primarily from [[Poland]]. Bochum was the main center of the [[Ruhrpolen|Polish community of the Ruhr]], being the seat of various Polish organizations and enterprises.<ref name=lwl>{{cite web|url=https://www.lwl.org/fremde-impulse-download/start/LWL/Kultur/fremde-impulse/die_impulse/Impuls-Polen-um-1900/index-lang=en.html|title=Bochum as the center of the Polish movement|website=Lwl.org|access-date=30 May 2021}}</ref> The Poles were subjected to [[Anti-Polish sentiment|anti-Polish]] policies aimed at [[Germanisation]], and the Central Office for Monitoring the Polish Movement in the Rhine-Westphalian Industrial District ({{lang|de|Zentralstelle fur Uberwachung der Polenbewegung im Rheinisch-Westfalischen Industriebezirke}}) was established by the German authorities in Bochum in 1909.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Chojnacki|first=Wojciech|year=1981|title=Księgarstwo polskie w Westfalii i Nadarenii do 1914 roku|magazine=Studia Polonijne|language=pl|location=[[Lublin]]|publisher=Towarzystwo Naukowe [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin|KUL]]|issue=4|page=202}}</ref>

===The Nazi era and World War II===
On 28 October 1938, 250 Polish or stateless Jews were expelled from Bochum to Poland.<ref name=jvl>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/bochum|title=Bochum|website=Jewish Virtual Library|access-date=30 May 2021}}</ref> On 9 November 1938, [[Kristallnacht]], the Bochum [[synagogue]] was set on fire and there was rioting against Jewish citizens. The first Jews from Bochum were deported to [[Nazi concentration camps]]{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} and many Jewish institutions and homes were destroyed. Some 500 Jewish citizens are known by name to have been killed in the [[Holocaust]], including 19 who were younger than 16 years old. Joseph Klirsfeld was Bochum's rabbi at this time. He and his wife fled to Palestine. In December 1938, the Jewish elementary school teacher [[Else Hirsch]] began organising groups of children and adolescents to be sent to the [[Netherlands]] and [[England]], sending ten groups in all. Many Jewish children and those from other persecuted groups were taken in by Dutch families and thereby saved from abduction or deportation and death.<ref>Karin Finkbohner, Betti Helbing, Carola Horn, Anita Krämer, Astrid Schmidt-Ritter, Kathy Vowe.

Because the Ruhr region was an area of high residential density and a centre for the manufacture of weapons, it was a major target in the war. Women with young children, school children and the homeless fled or were evacuated to safer areas, leaving cities largely deserted to the arms industry, coal mines and steel plants and those unable to leave.

===Post-war period===
After the war, Bochum was part of [[West Germany]] and the newly established state of North Rhine-Westphalia, consisting of the Rhineland and Westphalia.

In the postwar period, Bochum began developing as a cultural centre of the Ruhr area. In 1965, the [[Ruhr University]] was opened, the first modern [[university]] in the Ruhr area and the first to be founded in Germany since [[World War II]]. Since the seventies, Bochum's industry has moved from heavy industry to the service sector. Between 1960 and 1980, the coal mines all closed. Other industries, such as [[automotive industry|automotive]], compensated for the loss of jobs. The [[Opel Astra]] was assembled at the Opel Bochum [[factory|plant]]; however, by 2009, the factory was in serious financial difficulties<ref>{{Cite news|last=Schwartz|first=Nelson D.|date=2009-05-26|title=Europe Feels the Strain of Protecting Workers and Plants|language=en-US|work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/26/business/global/26eurocar.html|access-date=2023-01-01|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> and in December 2012, Opel announced that it would stop vehicle production at the Bochum plant in 2016.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCABRE8B90HA20121210 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109004400/http://ca.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCABRE8B90HA20121210 |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 9, 2015 |title=Opel sees no alternative to closing Bochum |date=10 December 2012 | work=Reuters}}</ref>

In the course of a comprehensive community reform in 1975, [[Wattenscheid]], a formerly independent city, was integrated into the city of Bochum. A local referendum against the integration failed. In 2007, the new synagogue of the Jewish community of Bochum, Herne und Hattingen was opened. In 2008, [[Nokia]] closed down its production plant, causing the loss of thousands of jobs, both at the plant and at local suppliers. 20,000 people showed up to protest against the closing.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2008-02-23|title=Nokia to close Bochum, Germany, plant|url=https://www.financialexpress.com/archive/nokia-to-close-bochum-germany-plant/276336/|access-date=2023-01-01|website=The Financial Express|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/1135233441536 "Anger at Nokia swells in Germany; top politicians join fray over plant closure"] ''Helsingin Sanomat International Edition.'' 21 January 2008.

[[File:Bochum 070608 095 00.jpg|thumb|City Hall]]
[[File:Altes Brauhaus Bochum.JPG|thumb|Altes Brauhaus]]
* '''Bochum City Hall''' was built from 1927 to 1931 and was designed by architect Karl Roth as a modern office building, but in the Renaissance style, reflecting the industrial era's middle class, inventions and discoveries. There were statues of bronze and stone, and in the city council chambers, a bell tower. The ornate décor gave the Nazis an excuse to hound the then-mayor, who was of Jewish descent, driving him to suicide in 1933.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Most of the bronze statues were melted down for the war effort and the stone carvings were damaged by the war, save for some small lion's heads over the entrance. Also left undamaged are two themed courtyard fountains made by August Vogel, the "Fountain of Beauty" and the "Fountain of Happiness", as well as Augusto Vasaris' florentine main entrance, which displays the motto, ''In Labore Honos'' (In labour lies honour). In 1951, a set of 28 chimes was installed, manufactured in Bochum. Known for their clarity of tone, they are the first cast steel chimes in the world.<ref>[http://www.oktober.de/rundgang/rathaus.html City Hall] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823070216/http://www.oktober.de/rundgang/rathaus.html |date=2010-08-23 }} "Historischer Rundgang Bochum – Rathaus".

* '''Altes Brauhaus Rietkötter''', the Old Rietkötter Brewing House is one of the oldest houses in Bochum, dating from 1630. Originally a private home, it became a brewery in 1777. After nearly being torn down after the war, it now has preservation status and today houses a restaurant, where they still brew their own beer.<ref>[http://www.altes-brauhaus-rietkoetter.de/html/historie.html Altes Brauhaus Rietkötter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819103221/http://www.altes-brauhaus-rietkoetter.de/html/historie.html |date=2009-08-19 }} Official website.

* The '''Kaufhaus Kortum''' department store dates from 1913 and was built as one of the nearly 20 regional stores owned by Alsberg Bros. (Gebr. Alsberg, AG) of Cologne. During the Nazi era, these stores were taken away from their Jewish owners and put into non-Jewish hands. Today, the "Kaufhaus Kortum" building has preservation status and houses an electronics store.
* The '''Friedrich Lueg Haus''' was built in 1924–1925 as the first high-rise building in Bochum. Contracted by the Lueg Company, the seven-story building was designed by the architect Emil Pohle. It suffered a fire during a bombing raid in 1944 and was renovated after the war. Today, the upper floors are small offices and internet companies. The seven-theatre Bochum Union Cinema rents the ground floor, showing a variety of domestic and international films.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Union Filmtheater: Home|url=https://www.kino-bochum.de/|access-date=2023-01-01|website=www.kino-bochum.de|language=de}}</ref>
* '''Mutter Wittig''' is a baroque-style building in the town centre, originally opened as a bakery and inn in 1870. Damaged in World War II, its façade is protected by preservation status. It houses a restaurant and its windows are decorated with displays of old Bochum.<ref>[http://www.oktober.de/rundgang/mutter_wittig.html "Mutter Wittig"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823065828/http://www.oktober.de/rundgang/mutter_wittig.html |date=2010-08-23 }} "Historischer Rundgang Bochum – Mutter Wittig".

* The '''Schlegel Tower''' is the only remaining structure of the once-important Schlegel brewery, which closed in 1980.
* The '''Jahrhunderthalle''' (Hall of the Century) is the former gas and power station of a steel mill built at the turn of the 20th century.

* '''Dahlhauser Heide''' is an example of social welfare provided by wealthy German industrialists for their workers. Built in the early 1900s by the [[Krupp]] family for their coal mine workers, the modest and tastefully designed two-family houses were to enable self-sufficiency by providing gardens and a stall for a pig or a goat, "the miner's cow".

* '''[[Burg Blankenstein|Blankenstein Castle]]''' was built in the 13th century by Count [[Adolf I of the Mark]]. Though located in [[Hattingen]], it is owned by Bochum and has a significant history. On 8 June 1321, Count [[Engelbert II of the Mark]] granted Bochum its town charter there. Today, only the gate and one tower remain.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jaquet|first=Pierre|title=Burg Blankenstein|url=https://www.ruhr-guide.de/freizeit/burgen-und-schloesser/burg-blankenstein/9672,0,0.html|access-date=2023-01-01|website=www.ruhr-guide.de|date=22 October 2021 |language=de}}</ref>
* '''Haus Kemnade''' is a moated castle. Though located in the town of [[Hattingen]], the castle is property of the city of Bochum in 1921. Documents regarding its earliest dates of construction have been lost; it is first mentioned in 1393. Parts of the castle were built during the Renaissance and baroque periods. The castle's location on the banks of the Ruhr river was changed when the flood of 1486 receded on the opposite side, cutting the castle off from the neighbouring village. The castle remained in private hands till 1921, when it was deeded to the city of Bochum. In 1961, a museum of local history was installed, including a large collection of 16th to 20th century musical instruments. A collection of East Asian objects is also now located there, as well as a satellite of the Bochum Museum and an art exhibition space. There is also a restaurant on site. Behind the castle is a [[Fachwerk|timber-framed]] farmhouse from 1800, now a museum exhibiting farm life from the past.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jaquet|first=Pierre|title=Wasserburg Haus Kemnade|url=https://www.ruhr-guide.de/freizeit/burgen-und-schloesser/wasserburg-haus-kemnade/9393,0,0.html|access-date=2023-01-01|website=www.ruhr-guide.de|date=26 March 2015 |language=de}}</ref>

====Religious architecture====
[[File:Bochum Probsteikirche.jpg|thumb|Church founded by [[Charlemagne]]]]
[[File:Bochum-Mitte, Bermuda3eck poging1 foto7 2016-08-14 09.14.jpg|Bochum-Mitte, das Bermuda3eck|thumb]]

* '''Propsteikirche St. Peter und Paul''' is the oldest church in Bochum, built between 785 and 800 by [[Charlemagne]]. It was rebuilt in the 11th century, but was severely damaged by fire in 1517. In 1547, it was again rebuilt, this time in the late Gothic style. The 68-metre (223&nbsp;ft) high bell tower is one of the landmarks of Bochum. The interior includes a baptismal font from 1175, the reliquary shrine of St. [[Perpetua]] and her slave Felicitas, and a high altar with a crucifix from 1352.
* '''Pauluskirche''' is the main Protestant church of the city. After the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], both Catholics and Lutherans shared the Propsteikirche, often contentiously. In 1655, the Lutherans began to build their own church with the help of donations from the [[Dutch Republic]], [[Sweden]], [[Courland]] and [[Denmark]]. The church was heavily damaged in a bombing raid on 12 June 1943 and was later rebuilt after the war. Next to the church is a monument to peace. A statue of an old woman searching for a loved one, it is also a memorial to the 4 November 1944 bombing raid on Bochum. [[Hans Ehrenberg]] served as minister here, until he was arrested and sent to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] by the Nazis.<ref>[http://www.bochum.de/C125708500379A31/vwContentByKey/W2733H35173BOLDDE "Station 12: Christuskirche"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727104847/http://www.bochum.de/C125708500379A31/vwContentByKey/W2733H35173BOLDDE |date=2011-07-27 }} Stadt Bochum (City of Bochum), official website.

* The '''Christuskirche''', built in the neo-Gothic style, opened in 1879 and was among the most beautiful churches in Europe. In 1931, the room in the steeple was extended to a [[cenotaph]] for those killed in World War I. During an air raid in 1943, the church was destroyed, except for the steeple. After the war, the ruins were integrated into a new, modern structure and the steeple became a memorial dedicated to peace and understanding among nations.
* The neo-Gothic '''Marienkirche''', built between 1868 and 1872, was heavily damaged in World War II (see photo above), but was rebuilt after the war. It is now closed and scheduled for demolition. The stained glass windows have been removed and it has fallen victim to vandalism.
* '''Stiepeler Dorfkirche''' is over 1000 years old and was commemorated by a stamp in 2008. A small church consisting of one room was built by Countess Imma von [[Stiepel]]. Between 1130 and 1170, the old church was replaced by a Romanesque basilica. Today, the steeple and transept remain. Between 1150 and 1200, the interior walls and ceiling were decorated with a number of Romanesque paintings.
* The '''new synagogue''', which opened in 2007, consists of a white cube and stands in contrast to the round shape of the planetarium next door. The façade shows overall a variation on the Solomon's Seal achieved by relocated brickstones. The interior is graced with a gold-coloured canopy.

The herdsmans of the town guided until 1870 the cattle of the citizens to the "Vöde", a grassland outside the town limits, a part of it is today the municipal park. Local legends say it is "the last herdsman Fritz Kortebusch". But he died 1866, nevertheless he done this job for a long time. 
* Engelbert statue in the front of the Propsteikirche. In former times it was a fountain with statue at the Kortumstrasse. It is for memory of Earl Engelbert III, who founded the so-called Maiabendfest. It is often assumed that the statue shows his grandfather Engelbert II, who granted extended market rights to Bochum in 1321.

* Cenotaph for the victims of the mine disaster at "Vereinigte Präsident" in 1936 at the graveyard in Bochum-Hamme. The sculpture was created by Wilhelm Wulff. Strict guidelines for artwork were in effect during the Nazi dictatorship, yet the sculpture follows only a few of them. The inscription also avoids typical Nazi phraseology.

==Transport==

===Roads===
Bochum is connected to the [[Autobahn]] network by the [[Bundesautobahn 40|A 40]], [[Bundesautobahn 43|A 43]] and [[Bundesautobahn 44|A 44]] autobahns. In addition, Bochum has a ring road, built to expressway standards, consisting of four segments; the Donezk, Oviedo, Nordhausen and Sheffield-Ring roads. It serves as a three-quarter loop around central Bochum and begins and ends at Autobahn A40. [[Ruhr University Bochum]] is also served by an expressway running from the Nordhausen-Ring to Autobahn A43. Until 2012, a new interchange (Dreieck Bochum-West) between the Donezk-Ring and Autobahn A40 is being constructed within tight parameters due to the existence of a nearby factory.

Apart from the autobahns and expressways, there is also a small ring road around the centre of Bochum, where most roads radiating out of Bochum begin. Most main roads in Bochum are multi-lane roads with traffic lights. Bochum is also served by the [[Bundesstraße 51]] and [[Bundesstraße 226]]. B51 runs to Herne and Hattingen, and B226 runs to Gelsenkirchen and Witten.

===Railways===
[[File:Bochum - Kurt-Schumacher-Platz - Hbf 01 ies.jpg|thumb|[[Bochum Hauptbahnhof]], the city's main railway station]]
Bochum has a [[Bochum Hauptbahnhof|central station]] situated on the [[Witten/Dortmund–Oberhausen/Duisburg railway|line from Duisburg to Dortmund]], connecting the city to the long-distance network of [[Deutsche Bahn]] as well as to the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] [[S-Bahn]] network.

===Bus, tram, underground===
Local service is supplied mainly by [[BOGESTRA]], a joint venture handling transportation between the cities of Bochum and Gelsenkirchen. The [[Bochum Stadtbahn]] is a single underground line connecting the University of Bochum to [[Herne, Germany|Herne]], and the [[Trams in Bochum/Gelsenkirchen|Bochum/Gelsenkirchen tramway network]] is made up of several lines, partially underground, connecting to Gelsenkirchen, Hattingen and [[Witten]]. Public transport in the city is priced according to the fare system of the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr|VRR]] transport association.

===Waterways===
As one of the few [[Ruhr area]] cities, Bochum is not directly connected with the German waterway net; the closest link is in the more northern located [[Herne Common|Herne]] at the [[Rhine-Herne Canal]]. In the south the border of Bochum is marked by the [[Ruhr]]. Up to the first half of the 19th century it was one of the most-travelled rivers in [[Europe]] and was mainly used for coal departure. Aside from cruise ships, it is no longer used for commercial navigation.

===Air===
The closest airports are [[Essen/Mülheim Airport]] (27&nbsp;km), [[Dortmund Airport]] (31&nbsp;km) and [[Düsseldorf Airport]] (47&nbsp;km). To reach the airport in [[Düsseldorf]], there are [[InterCityExpress|ICE]], [[Intercity (Deutsche Bahn)|InterCity]], RE and S railway lines. Other reachable airports are the [[Cologne Bonn Airport]], the [[Weeze Airport]], the [[Münster International Airport]] and the [[Paderborn Lippstadt Airport]].
