=== Ancient Yalova===
{{redirect2|Pylae|Pylai|the town of ancient Cilicia|Pylae (Cilicia)}}
The first settlement in the region dates back to the Prehistoric Period, in around 3000 BC.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The [[Hittites]] ruled the region in the 21st century BC,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} followed by the [[Phrygians]] in the 13th century BC, and then the Greeks in the archaic, classical and Hellenistic eras. The region was conquered by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in 74 BC. After the fall of the Roman Empire, it became part of the Byzantine Empire.

In Antiquity and for most of the Middle Ages, the town was known as '''Pylae''' or '''Pylai''' ({{langx|el|Πύλαι}}), which is Greek for "gates" since it was positioned at the start of one of the main routes to Asia for anyone crossing the [[Sea of Marmara]] into [[Bithynia]] from Europe.<ref name="ODB">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Foss | first = Clive | title = Pylai | page = 1760 | editor-last=Kazhdan | editor-first=Alexander | editor-link=Alexander Kazhdan | year=1991 | encyclopedia = [[The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | location = Oxford and New York | publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-504652-6 }}</ref>

===Middle Ages===
In the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]] the town retained some its importance due to its geographic location, and emperors frequently used it as a disembarkation point from [[Constantinople]]. Thus Emperor [[Heraclius]] landed here in 622, at the beginning of his [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628|counter-offensive against the Persians]], and [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] did the same in 1071, on his way to the [[Battle of Manzikert]].<ref name="ODB"/> In the 9th century, the town was also the site of one of the [[Byzantine beacon system|beacons that transmitted news]] from the frontier with the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], and contained an imperial hostel for travellers. In the late 10th century, however, [[Leo of Synada]] described Pylae as little more than a village, where cattle, horses, pigs and other animals were gathered to be shipped to Constantinople.<ref name="ODB"/>

After their victory at Manzikert, the town and surrounding district were raided by the [[Seljuk Turks]] but soon recovered. In 1147 Greek refugees from [[Phrygia]] were settled here. In a 1199 charter of privileges granted to [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] merchants, it is listed as a separate fiscal district (''[[episkepsis|episkepsi]]'') along with neighbouring [[Pythia Therma]], and it was a separate province by the time of the [[Fourth Crusade]] (1204).<ref name="ODB"/> Following the [[siege of Constantinople (1204)|fall of Constantinople]] to the Crusaders, Pylae formed part of the [[Empire of Nicaea]], and served as the main port for [[Nicaea]] itself.<ref name="ODB"/> Pylae remained in Byzantine hands until ca. 1302, when Turkish attacks intensitied, forcing much of the population to abandon it and seek refuge in the [[Princes' Islands]].<ref name="ODB"/>

===Ottoman and Republican eras===
Shortly afterwards, Yalova was incorporated into the territory of the [[Ottoman Empire]] under the leadership of [[Orhan]]. It became part of the [[Sanjak of Kocaeli]] and was known successively as "Yalakabad" and "Yalıova". Since the second half of the 19th century, a large number of [[Avars (Caucasus)|Avar]] immigrants from [[Dagestan]] moved into the town.

According to the [[1914 population statistics for the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman population statistics of 1914]], the [[kaza]] of Yalova had a total population of 21,532, consisting of 10,274 [[Greeks]], 7,954 [[Turkish people|Turks]] and 3,304 [[Armenians]].<ref>[[Kemal Karpat]] (1985), [https://kupdf.net/downloadFile/59e4a7b908bbc56144e653d7 Ottoman Population, 1830–1914, Demographic and Social Characteristics], [[The University of Wisconsin Press]], p. 184-185</ref> On 5 September 1920 It was occupied by the [[Greek Army]] during the [[Turkish War of Independence]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190306013227/http://www.atam.gov.tr/dergi/sayi-54/kurtulus-savasi-doneminde-kocaeli-yalova-iznik-cevresinde-rum-ve-ermeni-teroru Kurtuluş Savaşı Döneminde Kocaeli-Yalova-İznik Çevresinde Rum ve Ermeni Terörü], Atatürk Araştırma Merkezi</ref> At this time, the [[Yalova Peninsula genocide]] occurred which were committed by the [[Greek Army]] against the local [[Turkish people|Turkish]] population. Yalova was captured by Turkish troops on 19 July 1921.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yalovamiz.com/article.php?id=3135 |title=Yalova'nın Düşman İşgalinden Kurtuluşu |website=www.yalovamiz.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004122932/http://www.yalovamiz.com/article.php?id=3135 |archive-date=2015-10-04}}</ref> 

[[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] occasionally lived in Yalova in his later years, claiming in one of his speeches that "Yalova is my city." After the recapture of Yalova by the [[Turkish Army]] on 19 July 1921. 

Yalova was initially the centre for the [[Karamürsel]] district of [[Kocaeli Province]]. In 1930 it became a district centre in [[Istanbul Province|Istanbul province]] after joining two villages from [[Orhangazi]]. Finally in 1995 it became a provincial capital.

== Attractions ==

=== In Yalova town ===
In the town itself the only significant attraction is the so-called Yürüyen Köşkü (Walking Pavilon), a pretty waterside villa which was used by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the modern [[Turkey]], during his visits. It takes its name from the fact that Atatürk preferred to have it dismantled and moved slightly rather than cut down a tree that was impeding the view as its grew.

The [[Yalova Earthquake Monument]] in the 17 August Park on the coast of [[Marmara Sea]] commemorates the thousands of lives lost in August 1999 when a huge earthquake devastated the north-west corner of Turkey which included Yalova. 

=== In Termal ===
Yalova is best known for the [[hot springs]] in the [[Termal]] district, which gets its name from the Greek word ''[[thermae]]'' (''{{lang|grc|θερμαί}}'') 'warm'. There appears to have been some sort of spa resort here since Byzantine times and the 17th-century travel writer [[Evliya Çelebi]] reported the existence of the Kurşunlu Banyo (Leaded Bath) at the time of his visit. The resort was expanded during the reign of Sultan Abdülhamid II and again during Atatürk's day.<ref>{{Cite web |title=TERMAL |url=http://www.turkeyfromtheinside.com/places-to-go/y/42-places-to-go/403-termal.html |access-date=2022-10-06 |website=www.turkeyfromtheinside.com}}</ref>

Also in Termal is the Atatürk Arboretum which is said to contain 1800 different species of plant. It was commissioned by Atatürk in 1929 and was the first arboretum in the country. <ref>{{Cite web |title=Türkiye'nin ilk arboretumu 'Atatürk Arboretumu' 89 yaşında |url=https://www.ntv.com.tr/seyahat/turkiyenin-ilk-arboretumu-ataturk-arboretumu-89-yasinda,qTTfYIAIlUC0fygVYLR39w |access-date=2022-10-06 |website=www.ntv.com.tr |language=tr}}</ref> A summer-house used by Atatürk is also open to the public in the grounds.<ref>{{Cite web |title=TERMAL |url=http://www.turkeyfromtheinside.com/places-to-go/y/42-places-to-go/403-termal.html |access-date=2022-10-06 |website=www.turkeyfromtheinside.com}}</ref>
