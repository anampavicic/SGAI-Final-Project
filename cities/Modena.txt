A town, and seat of an [[archbishop]], it is known for its car industry since the factories of the famous Italian upper-class [[sports car]] makers [[Ferrari]], [[De Tomaso]], [[Lamborghini]], [[Pagani (automobile)|Pagani]] and [[Maserati]] are, or were, located there and all, except Lamborghini, (having their factory in [[Sant'Agata Bolognese]]), have headquarters in the city or nearby. One of Ferrari's cars, the [[Ferrari 360|360 Modena]], was named after the town itself. Ferrari's production plant and [[Formula One]] team [[Scuderia Ferrari]] are based in [[Maranello]] south of the city.

The [[University of Modena]], founded in 1175 and expanded by [[Francesco II d'Este]] in 1686, focuses on [[economics]], [[medicine]] and [[law]], and is the second oldest [[:wikt:athenaeum|athenaeum]] in Italy. Italian military officers are trained at the [[Military Academy of Modena]], and partly housed in the Baroque [[Ducal Palace of Modena|Ducal Palace]]. The [[Biblioteca Estense]] houses historical volumes and 3,000 manuscripts. The [[Duomo di Modena|Cathedral of Modena]], the [[Torre della Ghirlandina]] and Piazza Grande are a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] since 1997.

Modena is also known in culinary circles for its production of [[balsamic vinegar]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Redazione|date=2020-07-10|title=Aceto balsamico di Modena DOP IGP: una storia millenaria|url=https://www.beverfood.com/aceto-balsamico-modena-dop-igp-storia-millenaria-wd/|access-date=2021-06-04|website=beverfood.com|language=it-IT}}</ref>

Famous ''Modenesi'' include [[Mary of Modena]], the [[Queen consort]] of England and Scotland; operatic tenor [[Luciano Pavarotti]] and soprano [[Mirella Freni]], born in Modena itself; [[Enzo Ferrari]], eponymous founder of the Ferrari motor company; Catholic priest [[Gabriele Amorth]]; chef [[Massimo Bottura]]; comics artist [[Franco Bonvicini]]; the band [[Modena City Ramblers]] and singer-songwriter [[Francesco Guccini]], who lived here for several decades.

==Geography==
Modena lies on the [[Po Valley|Pianura Padana]], and is bounded by the two rivers [[Secchia]] and [[Panaro (river)|Panaro]], both affluents of the [[Po River]]. Their presence is symbolized by the Two Rivers Fountain in the city's center, by [[Giuseppe Graziosi]]. The city is connected to the Panaro by the Naviglio channel.

The [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] begin some {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} from the city, to the south.

The comune is divided into four ''[[circoscrizioni]]''. These are:
* Centro storico (Historical Center, San Cataldo)
* Crocetta (San Lazzaro-East Modena, Crocetta)
* Buon Pastore (Buon Pastore, Sant'Agnese, San Damaso)
* San Faustino (S.Faustino-Saliceta San Giuliano, Madonnina-Quattro Ville)

=== Climate ===
Modena has a [[humid subtropical climate]], with [[Humid continental climate|continental]] influences. It has an average annual precipitation of {{convert|809|mm|in}}. Summers are hot and winters are cool, with [[snow]]fall. This climate is described by the [[Köppen climate classification]] as ''Cfa''.

==Municipal administration==
{{See also|List of mayors of Modena}}
From 1946 to 1992, Modena had a series of [[Italian Communist Party|Communist]] mayors. From the 1990s, the city has been governed by [[Centre-left coalition (Italy)|center-left coalitions]].

The legislative body of the municipality (''[[comune]]'') is the City Council ({{lang|it|Consiglio Comunale}}), which is composed by 32 members elected - jointly with the mayor - by the citizens every five years. Modena's executive body is the City Committee (''Giunta Comunale''), which is composed by 9 [[Assessor (Italy)|assessors]] (appointed and dismissed by the mayor), of which one is deputy-mayor, and the mayor. The mayor from 2019 to 2024 of Modena is [[Gian Carlo Muzzarelli]], member of the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]].

==History==
{{For timeline}}

===Ancient times===

The territory around Modena ({{Langx|la|Mutina}}, {{Langx|ett|Mutna}}) was inhabited by the [[Villanovan]]s in the [[Iron Age]], and later by [[Ligures|Ligurian]] tribes, [[Etruscans]], and the [[Gaulish]] [[Boii]] (the settlement itself being Etruscan). Although the exact date of its foundation is unknown, it is known that it was already in existence in the 3rd century BC, for in 218 BC, during [[Hannibal's invasion of Italy]], the Boii revolted and laid siege to the city. [[Livy]] described it as a fortified citadel where Roman magistrates took shelter. The outcome of the siege is not known, but the city was most likely abandoned after Hannibal's arrival. Mutina was refounded as a Roman colony in 183 BC,<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Modena |volume=18 |pages=641–642}}</ref> to be used as a military base by [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 187 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], causing the Ligurians to sack it in 177 BC. Nonetheless, it was rebuilt, and quickly became the most important centre in [[Cisalpine Gaul]], both because of its strategic importance and because it was on an important crossroads between [[Via Aemilia]] and the road going to [[Verona]].

[[File:Modena Piazza Grande.jpg|center|thumb|800px|A view of Piazza Grande]]

In the 1st century BC, Mutina was besieged twice. The first siege was by [[Pompey]] in 78 BC, when Mutina was defended by [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Elder|Marcus Junius Brutus]]<ref name=EB1911/> (a populist leader, not to be confused with his son, Caesar's best known assassin). The city eventually surrendered out of hunger, and Brutus fled, only to be slain in [[Reggio Emilia|Regium Lepidi]]. In the civil war following [[Caesar's assassination]], the city was besieged again, this time by [[Mark Antony]], in 44 BC, and defended by [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus|Decimus Junius Brutus]].<ref name=EB1911/> [[Augustus|Octavian]] relieved the city with the help of the Senate (see: [[Battle of Mutina]]).

[[Cicero]] called it ''Mutina splendidissima'' ("most beautiful Mutina") in his ''Philippics'' (44 BC). Until the 3rd century AD, it kept its position as the most important city in the newly formed province [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Aemilia]], but the fall of the Empire brought Mutina down with it, as it was used as a military base both against the barbarians and in the civil wars. It is said that Mutina was never sacked by [[Attila]], for a dense fog hid it (a miracle said to be provided by [[Saint Geminianus]], bishop and patron of Modena), but it was eventually buried by a great flood in the 7th century and abandoned.

In December 2008, Italian researchers discovered the pottery center where the oil lamps that lit the ancient Roman empire were made. Evidence of the pottery workshops emerged in Modena, during construction work to build a residential complex near the ancient walls of the city. "We found a large ancient Roman dumping filled with pottery scraps. There were vases, bottles, bricks, but most of all, hundreds of oil lamps, each bearing their maker's name", [[Donato Labate]], the archaeologist in charge of the dig, stated.{{cn|date=July 2019}}

===Middle Ages===
Its exiles{{Why|date=May 2023|reason=It is logical that these exiles were survivors of the earlier-mentioned flood, but not specified.}} founded a new city a few miles to the northwest, still represented by the village of Cittanova (literally "new city"). About the end of the 9th century, Modena was restored and refortified by its bishop, [[Ludovicus, Bishop of Modena|Ludovicus]]. At about this time the ''[[Song of the Watchmen of Modena]]'' was composed. Later the city was part of the possessions of the Countess [[Matilda of Tuscany]], becoming a free [[medieval commune|comune]] starting from the 12th century. In the wars between [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]] and [[Pope Gregory IX]] Modena sided with the emperor.

The [[Este Family|Este family]] were identified as lords of Modena from 1288 ([[Obizzo II d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara|Obizzo d'Este]]). After the death of Obizzo's successor ([[Azzo VIII d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara|Azzo VIII]], in 1308) the [[comune]] reasserted itself, but by 1336 the Este family was permanently in power. Under [[Borso d'Este]], Modena was made a duchy.

===Late modern and contemporary (Renaissance)===
{{Main|Duchy of Modena and Reggio}}
Enlarged and fortified by [[Ercole II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara|Ercole II]], it was made the primary ducal residence when [[Ferrara]], the main Este seat, fell to the Pope in 1598. [[Francesco I d'Este, Duke of Modena]] (1629–1658) built the citadel and began the palace, which was largely embellished by [[Francesco II d'Este, Duke of Modena|Francesco II]]. In the 18th century, [[Rinaldo d'Este, Duke of Modena|Rinaldo d'Este]] was twice driven from his city by French invasions, and [[Francesco III d'Este|Francesco III]] built many of Modena's public buildings, but the Este pictures were sold and many of them wound up in [[Dresden]]. [[Ercole III d'Este|Ercole III]] died in exile at [[Treviso]], having refused Napoleonic offers of compensation when Modena was made part of the Napoleonic [[Cispadane Republic]]. His only daughter, [[Maria Beatrice d'Este, Duchess of Massa|Maria Beatrice d'Este]], married [[Ferdinand I, Archduke of Austria-Este]], son of Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]]; and in 1814 their eldest son, [[Francis IV, Duke of Modena|Francis IV]], received back the estates of the Este. Quickly, in 1816, he dismantled the fortifications and began Modena's years under Austrian rule.

His son [[Francis V, Duke of Modena|Francis V]] was considered a just ruler, and famously tended the victims of war and [[cholera]] with his own hands. However, he too had to face yet more foreign-inspired revolutions and was temporarily expelled from Modena in the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. He was restored, amidst wide popular acclaim, by Austrian troops. Ten years later, on 20 August 1859, the revolutionaries again invaded (this time the Piedmontese), annexing Modena to the revolutionary Savoyard [[Unification of Italy|Kingdom of Italy]].

===Ducal Palace===

[[File:Palazzo Comunale - Modena.jpg|thumb|Palazzo Comunale, Modena town hall]]
[[File:Modena Cathedral facade.jpg|thumb|Façade of the [[Duomo di Modena]], or Cathedral of [[Santa Maria Assunta]] and [[Saint Geminianus]]]]
[[File:Modena-duomo02.jpg|thumb|Interior of the cathedral]]

The [[Ducal Palace of Modena]], initiated by [[Francesco I d'Este]] in 1634 and completed by [[Francis V, Duke of Modena|Francis V]], was the seat of the Este court from the 17th to 19th century. The palace occupies the site of the former Este Castle, once located in the periphery of the city. Although generally credited to [[Bartolomeo Avanzini]], it has been suggested that advice and guidance in the design process had been sought from the contemporary luminaries, [[Pietro da Cortona|Cortona]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], and [[Francesco Borromini|Borromini]].

The Palace currently houses the [[Accademia Militare di Modena]], the Military Museum and a precious library.

The Palace has a Baroque façade, from which the Honour Court (where the military ceremonies are held) and the Honour Staircase can be accessed. The Central Hall has a frescoed ceiling with the 17th-century ''Incoronation of Bradamante'' by [[Marco Antonio Franceschini]]. The ''Salottino d'Oro'' ("Golden Hall"), covered with gilted removable panels, was used by Duke Francis III as his main cabinet of work.

===Town Hall===
Facing the Piazza Grande (a [[UNESCO World heritage site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]), the Town Hall of Modena was put together in the 17th and 18th centuries from several pre-existing edifices built from 1046 as municipal offices.

It is characterized by a Clock Tower (''Torre dell'Orologio'', late 15th century), once paired with another tower (''Torre Civica'') demolished after an earthquake in 1671. In the interior, noteworthy is the ''Sala del Fuoco'' ("Fire Hall"), with a painted frieze by [[Niccolò dell'Abbate]] (1546) portraying famous characters from Ancient Rome against a typical Emilia background. The ''Camerino dei Confirmati'' ("Chamber of the Confirmed") houses one of the symbols of the city, the ''Secchia Rapita'', a bucket kept in memory of the victorious [[Battle of Zappolino]] (1325) against [[Bologna]]. This relic inspired the poem of the same title by [[Alessandro Tassoni]]. Another relic from the Middle Ages in Modena is the ''Preda Ringadora'', a rectangular marble stone next to the palace porch, used as a speakers' platform, and the statue called ''La Bonissima'' ("The Very Good"): the latter, portraying a female figure, was erected in the square in 1268 and later installed over the porch.

===The Cathedral and the Ghirlandina===
{{Main articles|Duomo di Modena|Torre della Ghirlandina}}
[[File:-6007_IMG_1913_4_5_fused_copy-aL.jpg|thumb|View from Piazza Grande with detail of the statue of La Bonissima and the [[Ghirlandina tower]] in the background]]
The Cathedral of Modena and the annexed campanile are a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Begun under the direction of the Countess [[Matilda of Tuscany]]<ref name="EB1911" /> with its first stone laid 6 June 1099 and its crypt ready for the city's patron, [[Saint Geminianus]], and consecrated only six years later, the Duomo of Modena was finished in 1184. The building of a great cathedral in this flood-prone ravaged former center of [[Arianism]] was an act of [[urban renewal]] in itself, and an expression of the flood of piety that motivated the contemporary [[First Crusade]]. Unusually, the master builder's name, [[Lanfranco]], was celebrated in his own day: the city's chronicler expressed the popular confidence in the master-mason from [[Como]], Lanfranco: by God's mercy the man was found (''inventus est vir''). 

The sculptor [[Wiligelmo|Wiligelmus]] who directed the mason's yard was praised in the plaque that commemorated the founding. The program of the sculpture is not lost in a welter of detail: the wild dangerous universe of the exterior is mediated by the Biblical figures of the portals leading to the Christian world of the interior. In Wiligelmus' sculpture at Modena, the human body takes on a renewed physicality it had lost in the schematic symbolic figures of previous centuries. At the east end, three [[apse]]s reflect the division of the body of the cathedral into nave and wide aisles with their bold, solid masses. Modena's Duomo inspired campaigns of cathedral and abbey building in emulation through the valley of the [[Po River|Po]].

The [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[campanile]] (1224–1319) is called ''[[Torre della Ghirlandina]]'' from the bronze garland surrounding the weathercock.
===Other churches===

===Museums===
{{Main category|Museums in Modena}}

====Museum Palace====
The Museum Palace, on the St. Augustine square, is an example of civil architecture from the Este period, built as a Hostel for the poor, together with the nearby Hospital in the late 18th century. Today it houses the main museums of Modena:
* [[Estense Gallery]], with works by [[Tintoretto]], [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Guido Reni]], [[Correggio]], [[Cosmé Tura]] and brothers [[Annibale Carracci|Annibale]] and [[Agostino Carracci]]. The most famous works are the two portraits of Francis I d'Este, a sculpture by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] and a canvas by [[Diego Velázquez]].
* [[Biblioteca Estense|Estense Library]], one of the most important libraries in Italy.
* Museum of Medieval and Modern Art.
* Municipal Museum of [[Risorgimento]].
* Este Headstones Museum.
* Roman Lapidary Museum.
* Graziosi Gallery of Plaster Casts.
* City Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.

The Estense Gallery and Library have reopened on 29 May 2015 after the [[2012 Northern Italy earthquakes|earthquake of 2012]]. The Gallery has been completely restored but some pieces are still damaged and thus cannot be seen.

====Museums of the Cathedral====
Opened for the [[Great Jubilee]] in 2000, the Museum of the Cathedral houses a rich collection of artistic heritage, in particular liturgical ornaments and furnishings. Apart from the finds of the cathedral building site by Wiligelmus and Lanfranco, such as romanesque metopes and roof decorations, in the Lapidary there are also reliefs, sculptures and inscriptions of the Roman, Medieval and Renaissance era found in the cathedral area during the restoration works between the 19th and the 20th century.

====Museum Enzo Ferrari====
Inaugurated on 10 March 2012, the [[Museo Casa Enzo Ferrari|museum complex]] includes [[Enzo Ferrari]]'s birthplace and a futuristic automotive design gallery, painted in the yellow that Enzo Ferrari chose as the background for the Prancing horse on his logo. The exhibition gallery was designed by the famous architect [[Jan Kaplický]], who suddenly died in 2009, and carried on by his associate and loyal assistant Andrea Morgante.

The interior features a multimedia display of pictures, unpublished films and precious mementoes of Enzo Ferrari's life as a man, driver and car-maker throughout the 20th century.

The Exhibition Gallery houses a flexible mounting representing story, figures, places and races of the Modenese sport motor racing.

====Museum of Collectible Cards====
Founded in 1986 by Giuseppe Panini, who then decided to donate his collection to the city, the [[Museo della figurina]] was opened to the public on 15 December 2006. It is located inside the Santa Margherita Palace, which also houses the Delfini Library and the City Gallery.

The Museum houses several collections, including, apart from the classic stickers, cigarette cards, letter seals, matchboxes and calendars, all of which represent a very important historical document of the development of picture cards throughout the years.

===Teatro Comunale Modena===
The [[Teatro Comunale Modena]] (Community Theatre of Modena, but renamed in October 2007 as "Teatro Comunale Luciano Pavarotti") is an [[opera house]] in Modena. The idea for the creation of the present theatre dates from 1838, when it became apparent that the then-existing Teatro Comunale di via Emilia (in dual private and public ownership) was no longer suitable for staging opera.  However, this house had been the venue for presentations of all of the works of [[Donizetti]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] and [[Rossini]] up to this time, and a flourishing operatic culture existed in Modena.

Under the Mayor of Modena in collaboration with the [[Conservatorio dell'Illustrissima Comunità]] (Conservatory of the Most Illustrious Community), architect [[Francesco Vandelli]] was engaged to design the Teatro dell'Illustrissima Comunità, as the theatre was first called, "for the dignity of the city and for the transmission of the scenic arts".<ref>Quoted in Lynn, p.191</ref> Paid for in the manner typical of the time – from the sale of boxes – in addition to a significant gift from Duke Friedrich IV, Vandelli created a design for the new theatre combining ideas from those in [[Piacenza]], [[Mantua]], and [[Milan]], and it opened on 2 October 1841 with a performance of [[Gandini (opera composer)|Gandini]]'s ''Adelaide di Borgogna al Castello di Canossa'', an opera specially commissioned for the occasion.

===Cuisine===
[[File:Cotechino-Servito-Polenta-Lenticchie.jpg|right|thumb|''Cotechino Modena'', as served with [[polenta]] and [[lentils]]]]
Modena has a rich and diversified cuisine, often including meats, hams and salamis. One of the most famous ''modenese'' dishes is ''[[Cotechino Modena|zampone]]'' (the fatter and heartier version) or ''[[cotechino Modena]]'' (''cotechino'' is leaner and less fat than ''zampone''). ''Cotechino'' dates back to around 1511 to [[Mirandola]], where, whilst besieged, the people had to find a way to preserve meat and use the less tender cuts, so made the ''cotechino''. By the 18th century it had become more popular than the yellowish sausage had been around at the time, and in the 19th century was in [[mass production]] in and around the area.

Modena's contribution to the Italian pasta culture are ''[[tortellini]]'' and ''[[tortelloni]]'', which are squares of pasta shaped in the form of a ring and stuffed with meat or cheese.

''[[Cappello del prete]]'' is also a popular meal, which is a very fatty pig's trotter. Other dishes include ''[[torta Barozzi]]'' or ''[[Torta Barozzi|torta nera]]'', which is a black tart (a dessert made with a coffee/cocoa and almond filling encased in a fine pastry dough), ''[[ciccioli]]'', made by slowly cooking, compressing, drying, and aging fatty, leftover pieces of pork, and ''pesto modenese'', which is cured pork back fat pounded with garlic, rosemary and [[Parmesan]], used to fill borlenghi and crescentine.
