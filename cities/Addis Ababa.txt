It also attracted many members of the working classes – including artisans and merchants – and foreign visitors.

Addis Ababa saw a wide-scale economic boom in 1926 and 1927, and an increase in the number of buildings owned by the middle class, including stone houses filled with imported European furniture. The middle class also imported newly manufactured automobiles and expanded banking institutions.<ref name=":0" /> During the Italian occupation, urbanization and modernization steadily increased through a masterplan; it was hoped Addis Ababa would be a more "colonial" city and continued on after the occupation. Subsequent master plans were designed by French and British consultants from the 1940s onwards, focusing on monuments, civic structures, [[Satellite city|satellite cities]] and the inner-city. Similarly, the later Italo-Ethiopian masterplan (also projected in 1986) concerned only urban structure and accommodation services, but was later adapted by the 2003 masterplan.

Addis Ababa is a federally-chartered city in accordance with the Addis Ababa City Government Charter Proclamation No. 87/1997 in the [[1995 Constitution of Ethiopia|FDRE Constitution]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Federal Negarit Gazeta|year=2003|page=1|language=English}}</ref> Called "the political capital of Africa" due to its historical, diplomatic, and political significance for the continent, Addis Ababa serves as the headquarters of major international organizations, such as the [[African Union]] and the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]].<ref name="Political capital of Africa">{{cite web |url=http://www.uneca.org/uncc/ |title=United Nations Economic Commission for Africa |publisher=UNECA |access-date=5 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424124634/http://www.uneca.org/uncc/ |archive-date=24 April 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Prehistory===
A study based on DNA evidence from almost 1,000 people around the world suggests that early humans first traveled out of Africa via a place close to Addis Ababa, spreading from the region to the rest of the planet some time around 100,000 years ago.<ref name=":7">{{cite news |title=DNA Studies Trace Migration from Ethiopia |url=http://www.bnd.com/news/nation/story/262406.html |access-date=20 July 2021 |work=bnd.com |agency=bnd |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=22 February 2008 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20071020010637/http://www.bnd.com/news/nation/story/262406.html |archive-date=20 October 2007 |location=St. Louis}}</ref> The research indicated that genetic diversity decreases steadily the further one's ancestors travelled from Addis Ababa.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/21/AR2008022102739.html | title=Genetic Mutations Offer Insights on Human Diversity | newspaper=The Washington Post | first=David | last=Brown | date=22 February 2008 | access-date=23 April 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604224751/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/21/AR2008022102739.html?hpid=moreheadlines | archive-date=4 June 2011 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Middle Ages===
Mount [[Entoto]], a high tableland to the north of current Addis Ababa, is one of a handful of sites put forward as a possible location for a medieval imperial capital known as Barara. This permanent fortified city was established during the early to mid-15th century and it served as the main residence of several successive emperors up to the early 16th-century reign of [[Dawit II|Libne Dengel]].<ref name="persee.fr">{{cite journal |last1=Pankhurst |first1=Richard |title=Barara, the Royal City of 15th and Early 16th Century (Ethiopia). Medieval and Other Early Settlements Between Wechecha Range and Mt Yerer |journal=Annales d'Éthiopie |year=2009 |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=209–249 |doi=10.3406/ethio.2009.1394 |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/ethio_0066-2127_2009_num_24_1_1394}}</ref> The city was depicted standing between [[Mount Zuqualla]] and Menegasha on a map drawn by the Italian cartographer [[Fra Mauro]] in around 1450, and it was razed and plundered by [[Ahmed Gragn]] while the imperial army was trapped on the south of the [[Awash River]] in 1529, an event witnessed and documented two years later by the Yemeni writer Arab-Faqih. The suggestion that Barara was located on Mount Entoto is supported by the very recent discovery of a large medieval town overlooking Addis Ababa located between rock-hewn Washa Mikael and the more modern church of Entoto Maryam, founded in the late 19th century. Dubbed the Pentagon, the 30-hectare site incorporates a castle with 12 towers, along with 520 meters of stone walls measuring up to 5-meter high.<ref name="persee.fr"/>

====Initial settlements====
[[File:AbPalaisMénélikAddis-AbabaVers1900.jpg|thumb|Distant view of [[Menelik Palace]] in 1900]]
The city's immediate predecessor as the capital of Ethiopia, Entoto, was established by [[Menelik II]] in 1884. In addition, he had used it for a garrison base.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|date=2022-02-17|title=City Profile Addis Ababa|url=https://mdl.donau-uni.ac.at/ses/pluginfile.php/314/mod_page/content/4/City%20Profil%20Addis%20Ababa.pdf|access-date=17 February 2022|archive-date=17 February 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220217194306/https://mdl.donau-uni.ac.at/ses/pluginfile.php/314/mod_page/content/4/City%20Profil%20Addis%20Ababa.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> Menelik, initially the King of the [[Shewa]] province, had found [[Mount Entoto]] a useful base for military operations in the south of his realm, and in 1879 he visited the reputed ruins of the medieval town and the unfinished rock church. His interest in the area grew when his wife [[Taytu Betul|Taytu]] began work on a church on Mount Entoto, and Menelik endowed a second church in the area. It was given that Menelik had strong interest to settle in the area due to a partial influence of establishing his old empire and serving as a metropolis.<ref name=":2" /> After some time, Entoto was found to be unsatisfactory as a capital because of its cold climate, lack of water, and an acute shortage of firewood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Addis-Ababa|title=Addis Ababa &#124; History, Population, & Facts &#124; Britannica|website=www.britannica.com|access-date=9 February 2019|archive-date=11 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011095247/https://www.britannica.com/place/Addis-Ababa|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Founding====
In 1886, settlement began in the valley south of the mountain in a place called Finfinne, a name which refers to the presence of hot springs. The site was chosen by Empress Taytu Betul. Initially, she built a house for herself near the "Filwuha" hot [[mineral springs]], where she and members of the Shewan Royal Court liked to take mineral baths. Other nobility and their staff and households settled in the vicinity, and Menelik expanded his wife's house to become the [[Imperial Palace Addis Ababa|Imperial Palace]] in 1887 which remains the seat of government in Addis Ababa today.<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 6</ref> In 1886, the city was renamed to Addis Ababa as the capital of Menelik's kingdom of Shewa. It become the capital of Ethiopia in 1889, when Menelik became Emperor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Finfinne|title=Finfinne|via=The Free Dictionary|access-date=16 November 2020|archive-date=2 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210602214745/https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Finfinne|url-status=live}}</ref> The town grew by leaps and bounds. Not only for nobles, but also the site attracted numerous working classes including artisans, merchants, and foreign visitors.
[[File:British legation Addis Ababa 1910.jpg|thumb|The earliest urban dwelling typically made up of [[hut]] cluster. Here is an example of British legation pictured in 1910.]]
Early residential dwelling was typically made of circular huts; walls were constructed with mud (Amharic: ጭቃ, ''cheka'') and straw plastered on a wooden frame and thatched roofs. Addis Ababa's growth rate began with early rapid urbanization without preplanned intention. This was the time where nobilities embarked on concentrated permanent settlement, and altered by social patterns; i.e. each neighborhoods (''sefer'') was located on higher grounds, noncontiguous from adjacent settlements. The early social milieu contributed the contemporary admixture of a classic neighborhood. One of Emperor Menelik's contributions that are still visible today is the planting of numerous [[eucalyptus]] trees along the city streets.<ref>Pankhurst, p. 195</ref><ref name=":2" />

Moreover, the city held strong social organization patterns prior to the Italian invasion. According to [[Richard Pankhurst (Ethiopianist)|Richard Pankhurst]] (1968), the city's accelerated population growth was due to factors of provisional governors and their troops, the 1892 famine, and eventually the [[Battle of Adwa]]. Another includes the 1907 land act, municipal administration in 1909, and a railway and modernized transportation system boom beginning in the 20th century, culminating in continual growth. Additional supplements, for example the laying of [[Ethio-Djibouti Railways]] and topographical factors further led the city's boundary to expand southward.<ref name=":2" />

By 1926 and 1927, a large-scale economic revolution occurred, a surplus of coffee production began growing as a result of [[capital accumulation]]. Profiting from this wealth, the bourgeoisie benefited the city by constructing new, stone-fitted houses with imported European furniture and an importation of the latest automobiles, and expansion of banks across the locales. The total register of automobiles were 76 in 1926 and went to 578 in 1930. The first popular road transportation opened between Addis Ababa and Djibouti, about 97 miles northward in the direction of [[Dessie]]. Initially intended to connect Italian occupied [[Assab]] with Addis Ababa in the [[Italo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1928]], the road was considered for motor vehicle travel. The highway was important to the French railway of Djibouti and freight rate was very high with a lack of [[Competition (economics)|competition]], and increase of cargo between Ethiopia and Assab.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Freidson |first=Irving |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4XyqGRX6oBcC&pg=PA24 |title=Motor Roads in Africa: (except Union of South Africa). |date=1930 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |language=en |access-date=29 July 2022 |archive-date=4 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230704145436/https://books.google.com/books?id=4XyqGRX6oBcC&pg=PA24 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1930, the Emperor was crowned and proceeded with new technologies and building infrastructure. Among them, he installed power lines and telephones, and erected several monuments (such as [[Meyazia 27 Square]]).

Following all the major engagements of [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|their invasion]], the [[Fascist Italy (1922–43)|Italian]] troops from the colony of [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] entered Addis Ababa on 5 May 1936. Along with [[Dire Dawa]], the city had been spared the aerial bombardment (including the use of [[chemical weapons]] such as [[mustard gas]]) practiced elsewhere in Ethiopia. This also allowed [[Franco-Ethiopian Railway|its railway]] to [[Djibouti]] to remain intact. After the occupation, the city served as the [[Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta|Duke of Aosta]]'s capital for unified [[Italian East Africa]] until 1941, when it was abandoned in favor of [[Battle of Amba Alagi (1941)|Amba Alagi]] and other redoubts during the [[Second World War]]'s [[East African campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]]. According to Soviet estimates, 15,000 Ethiopians casualties were victims of chemical weapons, especially by [[sulfur mustard]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w0q6DQAAQBAJ&pg=PT66 |title=Weapons of War: Environmental Impact: Environmental Impact |date=2013-08-15 |publisher=KW Publishers Pvt Ltd |isbn=978-93-85714-71-9 |language=en |access-date=29 July 2022 |archive-date=4 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230704145512/https://books.google.com/books?id=w0q6DQAAQBAJ&pg=PT66 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Italian ambition regarding Addis Ababa was to create a beautified colonial capital city along with a new master plan launched by seven architects such as [[Marcello Piacentini]], Alessandro Bianchi, [[Enrico Del Debbio]], [[Giuseppe Vaccaro]], [[Le Corbusier]], [[Ignazio Guidi]] and [[Cesare Valle]]. Despite contradictory and different ideas for each other, the plan was intended to focus on the general architectural plan of the city. Two preparations were approved from the master plan: the Le Corbusier and Guidi and Valle. During an invitation to Mussolini, the French Swiss architect Le Corbusier illustrated the master plan in a guideline sketch involving a traversing route monumental structure by a grand [[boulevard]] across the city from north to south, as he extracted from his 1930–1933 Radiant City concept. His two counterparts, Guildi and Valle prepared the master plan in summer 1936 likely emphasizing fascist ideology with monumental structure and no native Ethiopian participation in designing sector. Two parallel axis were drawn in European character connecting [[Arada (district of Addis Ababa)|Arada]]/Giyorgis with the railway station to the south end five kilometers long and varied width spanning from 40 to 90 meters.<ref name=":4" />

On 5 May 1941, the city was liberated by Major [[Orde Wingate]] and [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Haile Selassie]] for Ethiopian [[Gideon Force]] and Ethiopian resistance in time to permit Emperor Haile Selassie's return on 5 May 1941, five years to the day after he had left.

====Post-Italian occupation (1941–1974)====
In the aftermath, Addis Ababa suffered from economic stagnation and rapid population growth, the inner-city affected by urban morphology initiated by Italian occupation and the peripheral area were in urban sprawl. In 1946, Haile Selassie invited famous British master planner Sir [[Patrick Abercrombie]] with goals of modelling and beautifying the city to become the capital for Africa. By this organizing model, Abercrombie launched the master plan with neighborhood units surrounded by green parkways, and he was encouraged to draw [[ring road]]s characterized by radial shapes to channel traffic pathway from the central area.<ref name=":4" />

His careful master plan of a major traffic route was completed by segregating neighborhood units, as he extracted from his 1943 [[London]] traffic problem. In 1959, the British consultant team named Bolton Hennessy and Partners commissioned an improvement of Abercrombie's 1954–1956 satellite towns. From the place, they did not incorporated outer area like Mekenissa and West of the old Air Port in the proposal, while Rapi, Gefersa, [[Akaky Kaliti|Kaliti]] and Kotebe proposed as outlet of [[Jimma]], [[Ambo, Oromia|Ambo]] and [[Dessie]] respectively (the four regional highways). The Hennessy and Partners illustration would be physically larger to current size of Addis Ababa with surrounded [[Satellite city|satellite towns]]. In 1965, the French Mission for Urban Studies and Habitat led by [[Luis De Marien]] launched another master plan responsible to create monumental axis through [[Addis Ababa City Hall]] with an extension across Gofa Mazoria in the southern part of the city.  Marien's difference to the previous Italian master plan was the use of single [[Monumental Axis|monumental axis]] while they used the double one.<ref name=":4" />

Haile Selassie also helped to form the [[Organisation of African Unity]] in 1963, which was later dissolved in 2002 and replaced by the [[African Union]] (AU), which is also headquartered in the city, airports and industrial parks. The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]] founded in 1958, also has its headquarters in Addis Ababa. Addis Ababa was also the site of the Council of the Oriental Orthodox Churches in 1965. Pankhurst (1962) noted in a survey of total land of 212 square kilometers, 58% owned by 1,768, owing to 10,000 square meters, and 12% were given to church whereas other small areas were still acquired in the name of posthumous nobilities such as ''Dejazemach'' [[Wube Haile Mariam]], ''Fitawrari'' Aba Koran, and a bridge named "Fitawrari Habtegiorgis" after [[Habte Giyorgis Dinagde]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |last1=Alemayehu |first1=Elias Yitbarek |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E9l9DwAAQBAJ&q=addis+ababa+history |title=The Transformation of Addis Ababa: A Multiform African City |last2=Stark |first2=Laura |date=2018-11-30 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |isbn=978-1-5275-2272-5 |language=en |access-date=31 May 2022 |archive-date=4 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230704145437/https://books.google.com/books?id=E9l9DwAAQBAJ&q=addis+ababa+history |url-status=live }}</ref> According to the 1965 master plan, the city covered an area of 21,000 hectares and would increase to 51,000 hectares by 1984 master plan.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal |last=Tufa |first=Dandena |date=2008 |title=Historical Development of Addis Ababa: plans and realities |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41967609 |journal=Journal of Ethiopian Studies |volume=41 |issue=1/2 |pages=27–59 |jstor=41967609 |issn=0304-2243 |access-date=19 July 2021 |archive-date=19 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210719135031/https://www.jstor.org/stable/41967609 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1965, the first student march took place in response to the feudal imperial government of Haile Selassie, in which they chanted "Land for the Tiller", culminating in a [[Marxist–Leninist]] movement in Ethiopia. In addition, the [[1973 oil crisis]] heavily impacted the city. 1,500 peasants in Addis Ababa marched to plead for food to be returned by police, and intellectual from [[Addis Ababa University]] forced the government to take a measure against the spreading famine, a report which Haile Selassie government denounced as "fabrication". Haile Selassie responded later "rich and poor have always existed and will, Why? Because there are those that work...and those that prefer to do nothing...Each individual is responsible for his misfortunes, his fate." Students around the city gathered to protest in February 1974; eventually Haile Selassie was successfully deposed from office in 1974 by a group of police officers. Later, the group named themselves [[Derg]], officially "Provisional Military Administrative Council" (PMAC).<ref>{{Citation |last=Kumar |first=B.

====The Derg administration (1974–1991)====
After the Derg came to power, roughly two-third of housing stock transferred to rental housing. The population growth declined from 6.5% to 3.7%. In 1975, the Derg nationalized "extra" rental structures built by private stockholders. As a result, the ''Proclamationon No. 47/1975'' issued weakened buildings with small amount of living was administered by ''[[Wards of Ethiopia|kebele]]'' units, while rental houses with large quality fell under [[Agency for Rental Housing Administration]] (ARHA). If those rental properties value less than 100 birr (US$48.31), they would be put under kebele administration.<ref name=":2" /> The administrative divisions showed an increase of woredas to 25 and 284 kebeles.<ref name=":4" />

Hungarian architect C.K. Polonyi was the first person to embark the city's master plan during the Derg period with assistance of the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing. He used two formula concentrating an integration Addis Ababa with suburbs of rural areas and developing inner-city. Polonyi also worked to redesign [[Meskel Square]], which was renamed Abiyot Square by the time, implemented immediately after the name change.<ref name=":4" />

In 1986, the Italo-Ethiopian master plan was set up by 45 Ethiopian professional along with 75 Italian experts with 207 sectorial reports documented as references. The plan dealt with a balanced urban system and services in urban area such as water supply. Akaki incorporated to Addis Ababa to supply industrial and freight terminal services. The bureaucratic rule of the Derg postponed the master plan for eight years until 1994, which caused failure of basic issues in public service and unplanned development.<ref name=":4" />

====Federal Democratic Republic (since 1991)====
On 28 May 1991, the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF), a coalition party in course of [[Fall of the Derg regime|overthrowing the Derg]], seized Addis Ababa. They entered Menelik II Avenue and ordered a curfew for 24 hours. According to a witness, residents of Addis Ababa were ignorant and not terrified by the event, as the military told them everything was safe. The military went to central locations of the city (such as Hilton Hotel) and displayed banners  "Peace, Solidarity, Friendship". At 5:30 am, they took control of the presidential palace and large-scale tanks were seen entering the area.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Addis Ababa falls to dawn onslaught |url=https://amp.theguardian.com/theguardian/1991/may/29/fromthearchive |access-date=2022-03-20 |website=The Guardian |archive-date=20 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220320201354/https://amp.theguardian.com/theguardian/1991/may/29/fromthearchive |url-status=live }}</ref>

A [[1995 Constitution of Ethiopia|new constitution]] was adapted in 1994 and enacted a year later; while all cities in Ethiopia accountable rule by regional authority, Addis Ababa (Proclamation No 87/1997) and [[Dire Dawa]] (Proclamation No 416/2004) remained chartered cities, with mandates for self-governing and developmental centers.<ref>{{Cite web |date=22 April 2022 |title=Addis Ababa City Government Revised Charter Proclamation |url=https://chilot.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/proclamation-no-35.pdf |website=Federal Negarit Gazeta |access-date=22 April 2022 |archive-date=4 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220704202543/https://chilot.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/proclamation-no-35.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> The ''Proclamation No. 112/1995'' legitimized privatization of many government buildings, with a few exceptions, and the kebele buildings remained in tenure.

From the end of 1998, new project was launched by Addis Ababa City Administration naming Office for Revision of Addis Ababa Master Plan (ORAAMP), covering from 1999 to 2003. The plan goal was to meet the standard of market economy with favorable political system resembles the revised 1986 master plan in terms of urban area.<ref name=":4" />

Addis Ababa has a [[Oceanic climate#Subtropical highland variety (Cfb, Cwb)|subtropical highland climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cwb'') with precipitation varying considerably by the month.<ref name="Climate-Data.org">{{cite web |url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/532/ |title=Climate: Addis Abeba (altitude: 2350m) – Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table |publisher=Climate-Data.org |access-date=6 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404184152/http://en.climate-data.org/location/532/ |archive-date=4 April 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> The city has a complex mix of [[alpine climate]] zones, with temperature differences of up to {{convert|10|C-change}}, depending on elevation and prevailing wind patterns. The high elevation moderates temperatures year-round, and the city's position near the [[Equator]] means that temperatures are very constant from month to month. As such the climate would be [[Oceanic climate|maritime]] if its elevation was not taken into account, as no month is above {{convert|22|C|F}} in mean temperatures.

Mid-November to January is a season for occasional rain. The highland climate regions are characterised by dry winters, and this is the dry season in Addis Ababa. During this season the daily maximum temperatures are usually not more than {{convert|23|°C}},  And the night-time minumum temperatures will range from 5°C to 10°C and can drop to freezing. The short rainy season is from February to May. During this period, the difference between the daytime maximum temperatures and the nighttime minimum temperatures is not as great as during other times of the year, with minimum temperatures in the range of {{convert|10|-|15|°C}}. At this time of the year, the city experiences warm temperatures and pleasant rainfall. The long wet season is from June to mid-September; it is the coldest time of the year. This period coincides with summer, but the temperatures are much lower than at other times of year because of the frequent rain and hail and the abundance of cloud cover and fewer hours of sunshine. This time of the year is characterised by dark, chilly and wet days and nights.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} The autumn which follows is a transitional period between the wet and dry seasons.

The highest temperature on record was {{convert|30.6|C}} 26 February 2019, while the lowest temperature on record was {{convert|0|C}}, recorded on multiple occasions.<ref name=meteoclimat/>

===Government===
{{Main article|Addis Ababa City Administration}}
{{See also|Mayor of Addis Ababa}}

Under the Ethiopian [[1995 Constitution of Ethiopia|Constitution of 1995]], the city of Addis Ababa is one of the two federal cities that are accountable to the Federal Government of Ethiopia. The other city with the same status is [[Dire Dawa]] in the east of the country and both are federal cities. Earlier, following the establishment of the federal structure in 1991 under the Transitional Charter of Ethiopia, the City Government of Addis Ababa was one of the then-new 14 regional governments. However, that structure was changed by the federal constitution in 1995 and as a result, Addis Ababa does not have statehood status.

The administration of Addis Ababa city consists of the [[Mayor of Addis Ababa|Mayor]], who leads the executive branch, and the City Council, which enacts city regulations. However, as part of the Federal Government, the federal legislature enacts laws that are binding in Addis Ababa. Members of the City Council are directly elected by the residents of the city and the council, in turn, elects the Mayor among its members. The term of office for elected officials is five years. However, the Federal Government, when it deems necessary, can dissolve the City Council and the entire administration and replace it with a temporary administration until elections take place next. Residents of Addis Ababa are represented in the federal legislature, the [[House of Peoples' Representatives]]. However, the city is not represented in the [[House of Federation]], which is the federal upper house constituted by the representatives of the member states. The executive branch under the Mayor comprises the City Manager and various branches of civil service offices.

[[Adanech Abebe]] is serving as the mayor of Addis Ababa since 2020, preceded by [[Takele Uma Banti]]. She is the [[List of first women mayors (21st century)|first woman to hold mayorship]] since its creation in 1910. Before Takele, the Federal Government appointed Berhane Deressa to lead the temporary caretaker administration that served from 9 May 2006 to 30 October 2008 following the 2005 election crisis. In the 2005 national election, the ruling EPRDF party suffered a major defeat in Addis Ababa. However, the opposition who won in Addis Ababa did not take part in the government both on the regional and federal levels. This situation forced the EPRDF-led Federal Government to assign a temporary administration until a new election was carried out. As a result, Berhane Deressa, an independent citizen, was appointed.

Former mayors of Addis Ababa include [[Arkebe Oqubay]] (2003–06), Zewde Teklu (1985–89), Alemu Abebe (1977–85) and Zewde Gebrehiwot (1960–69).

[[File:Bole international airport.jpg|thumb|[[Bole International Airport]]]]
[[File:Addis Abeba Taxis (Sam Effron).jpg|thumb|Blue and white [[taxi]] is the main public transport in Addis Ababa]]
Public transport is through public buses from three different companies ([[Anbessa City Bus Service Enterprise]], Sheger, Alliance), [[Light Rail]] or blue and white [[taxi]]s. The taxis are usually [[minibus]]es that can seat at most twelve people, which follow somewhat pre-defined routes. The minibus taxis are typically operated by two people, the driver and a ''[[weyala]]'' who collects fares and calls out the taxi's destination. Sedan taxis work like normal taxis and are driven to the desired destination on demand. In recent years, new taxi companies have appeared, which use other designs, including one large company using yellow sedan taxis and a few ride-hailing companies (Ride taxi, Feres, etc.) have become widely accessible in the city.

===Road===
The construction of the Addis Ababa Ring Road was initiated in 1998 to implement the city master plan and enhance peripheral development. The Ring Road was divided into three major phases that connect all the five main gates in and out of Addis Ababa with all other regions ([[Jimma]], [[Bishoftu]], [[Dessie]], [[Gojjam]] and [[Ambo, Ethiopia|Ambo]]). For this project, [[China Road and Bridge Corporation]] (CRBC) was the partner of Addis Ababa City Roads Authority (AACRA).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pdf-searcher.com/ADDIS-ABABA-RING-ROAD-PROJECT:-A-Case-Study-of-a-Chinese-....html |access-date=8 December 2010 |title=International Conference on Multi-National Construction Projects: Addis Ababa Ring Road Project – A Case Study of a Chinese ... |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174403/http://www.pdf-searcher.com/ADDIS-ABABA-RING-ROAD-PROJECT%3A-A-Case-Study-of-a-Chinese-....html |archive-date=3 March 2016}}</ref> The Ring Road has greatly helped to decongest and alleviate city traffic.
