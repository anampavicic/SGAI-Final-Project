'''Foz do Iguaçu''' ({{IPA|pt-BR|ˈfɔz du iɡwaˈsu}}; "[[Iguazu River]] mouth") is the Brazilian city on the border of [[Iguaçu Falls]]. Foz in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] means the mouth or end of a river and Iguaçu in [[Guarani language|Guarani]] or [[Tupi language|Tupi]] comes from the words "''y''" {{IPA|gn|ɨ|}}, meaning "water" or "river", and "''ûasú''" {{IPA|gn|waˈsu|}}, meaning "big". 

The city is the 7th largest in the state of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] with a population of approximately 258,000 inhabitants. It is approximately 650&nbsp;km (400&nbsp;mi) west of the capital of the state, [[Curitiba]], being the westernmost city in that State.

The inhabitants of the city are known as ''iguaçuenses''. The Iguaçu Falls located on the border of [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]] and consisting of approximately 257 individual [[waterfall]]s over {{convert|2.7|km|mi|abbr=on}} were chosen as one of the "''[[New Seven Wonders of Nature|New Natural Seven Wonders of the World]]''."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://en.mercopress.com/2011/11/12/iguazu-falls-chosen-as-one-of-the-natural-seven-wonders-of-the-world |title=Iguazu Falls chosen as one of the natural seven wonders of the world {{in lang|en}} |access-date=2014-08-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115002112/http://en.mercopress.com/2011/11/12/iguazu-falls-chosen-as-one-of-the-natural-seven-wonders-of-the-world |archive-date=2011-11-15 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city is characterized by [[tourism]] and [[cultural diversity]]. There are about 80 [[Nationality|nationalities]], being the most representative from [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Lebanon]], [[China]], [[Paraguay]] and Argentina. Foz do Iguaçu is integrated into a tri-national region, bordering the Argentine city of [[Puerto Iguazú]] and the Paraguayan city of [[Ciudad del Este]]. The city's economy is based on tourism, with emphasis on trade and services.<ref name="cataratasdoiguacu.com.br">{{cite web|url=http://www.cataratasdoiguacu.com.br/portal/paginas/115-foz-do-iguassu.aspx|title=Cataratas do Iguaçu - Portal Cataratas do Iguaçu S/A|website=www.cataratasdoiguacu.com.br|access-date=5 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501170432/http://www.cataratasdoiguacu.com.br/portal/paginas/115-foz-do-iguassu.aspx|archive-date=1 May 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

According to research conducted by the Brazilian Tourist Institute ([[Embratur]]) and the Foundation Institute of Economic Research (FIFE) in 2006, 2007 and 2008, Foz do Iguaçu was the 2nd most visited leisure destination by foreign tourists after Rio de Janeiro.<ref name="cataratasdoiguacu.com.br"/> In 2010, it received from the [[Ministry of Tourism (Brazil)|Brazilian Ministry of Tourism]] 10 awards for Best Practices and Competitiveness Index.<ref name="cataratasdoiguacu.com.br"/> Foz do Iguaçu has been noted as a destination by various national and international media: the British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' considered it the best foreign destination for the UK.<ref name="cataratasdoiguacu.com.br"/> The U.S. TV network [[CNN]] classified it as one of the 14 most romantic destinations.<ref name="cataratasdoiguacu.com.br"/>

Foz do Iguaçu is home of the [[Itaipu dam]], the world's second largest hydroelectric plant in power generation, after the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China. With 20 generator units and 14,000 MW of installed capacity, it provides approximately 15% of the energy consumed in Brazil and 86% of the energy consumed in Paraguay.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.itaipu.gov.br/en/energy/energy|title=ENERGY - ITAIPU BINACIONAL|website=www.itaipu.gov.br|access-date=5 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622154745/https://www.itaipu.gov.br/en/energy/energy|archive-date=22 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Geography==

===Climate===
[[File:Sunset_over_Iguazu2.jpg|thumb|left|Foz do Iguaçu National Park.]]
The climate of Foz do Iguaçu is [[humid subtropical]], with two distinctive seasons; one [[humid]] and hot in the summer and another, dry and cold, in the winter. The city's annual average temperature is 23.8&nbsp;°C (74.8&nbsp;°F), but can be as high as 40&nbsp;°C (104&nbsp;°F) in the summer (highest) or as low as -5&nbsp;°C (23&nbsp;°F) in the winter (lowest). The average in the summer is 26.5&nbsp;°C (79.7&nbsp;°F)and in the winter 15.4&nbsp;°C (59.6&nbsp;°F).

The climate of the city is hot or warm throughout the year, due to the relatively low altitude (standing only 173&nbsp;m, {{convert|567|ft|m|abbr=on}}, above sea level).

Generally, the city is sunny during the year, but rain is fairly common during the spring and in the summer. The weather of the city, however, changes very constantly, because the region where the city stands is the zone where frequently three fronts meet. As consequence, it is not uncommon to see temperatures as high as 35&nbsp;°C (95&nbsp;°F) and in the summer as low as 8&nbsp;°C (46&nbsp;°F) in the city and frequent thunderstorms.

== History ==
[[File:Parque Nacional do Iguaçú - Iguaçu National Park (14116588502).jpg|thumb|right|[[Flag]]s in Iguaçu National Park]]
In 1549, a [[Spaniards|Spanish]] explorer, [[Cabeza de Vaca]], found the falls while travelling down the river. Very impressed, he named them "Quedas de Santa Maria". Later the name changed to ''Quedas del Iguazú''; which was derived from the native name of the local [[Guarani people|Guarani]] Indians.<ref name="iguassu">{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903123321/http://www.iguassubrasil.com/detalhesatrativos.php?p2=218 |url=http://www.iguassubrasil.com/detalhesatrativos.php?p2=218 |title=Iguassu City History |archive-date=3 September 2014}}</ref>

Until 1860, it was under the disputed territory between [[Brazil]] and [[Paraguay]], but given the latter's defeat in the [[Paraguayan War]], the [[waterfall|fall]]s were recognized as part of the [[Brazil|Brazilian territory]].<ref name="iguassu"/>

In 1910, the colony's status was upgraded to the position of "vila" ([[town]] or [[village]]), named "Vila Iguazú", and, in 1914, to city. At that time, the city was known as Foz do Iguassú.<ref name="iguassu"/>
[[File:Legend of the Falls.jpg|thumb|left|Mural The Legend of the Falls commissioned in 2018 to Miguel Hacher]]
[[File:Cataratas do Iguaçu 001.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of [[Cataratas do Iguaçu|Iguaçu falls]]]]
In 1916, [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]] visited the region and, impressed with the beauty of the region, suggested more attention of the government to the area and asked for the appropriation of the land where currently is the Parque do Iguaçu (Iguaçu Park). Until 1917, this region had an owner, Jezus Val. The state appropriated the land in the next year, and, in 1939, the [[Parque Nacional do Iguaçu]] ("Iguaçu National Park") was created.<ref name="iguassu"/>

The city experienced a big economical boom in the 1960s to the late 1980s, first with the construction of the [[Ponte da Amizade|Friendship Bridge]], concluded in 1965, and the [[Itaipu Dam]], in operation since in 1984.<ref name="iguassu"/>

=== Spelling of the name ===
In 1945, an agreement between the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]] and the Academy of [[Lisbon]] changed the spelling of the city name to Foz do Iguaçu. 

On 19 October 2005, a proposal was made to revert the spelling of the city name to Foz do Iguassú. The proposal was approved in a first debate at the Town Hall and then rejected in a second debate, by four votes for and eight against.<ref name="iguassu"/>

The purpose of the adjustment to the city name was to return the spelling to the original form, as at the foundation of the city in 1914. The change occurred due [[language reform]]s of 1945, which changed the orthography of [[Brazilian Portuguese]]. However, existing proper names were not obliged to change. Another reason for the proposed adjustment back to the original was that 146 of the 198 member countries of the [[United Nations]] do not have the "ç" character in their [[alphabet]]s.<ref name="iguassu"/>

The adjustment would therefore rationalise any search for the city in search engines, since Foz do Iguaçu's is more widely known for the [[waterfall|fall]]s, which are known as the Iguassú Falls. The City councillor proponent of the bill, Djalma Pastorello, felt that [[tourism]] to the city of Foz do Iguaçu would improve greatly by a clarification of its association with the now-famous [[Iguassu Falls]]. However, he estimated that 70% of the city's population were against the name change because the local media anticipated the change and presented it in a distorted way, so that locals were unable to see that the intention was to benefit the [[population]].<ref name="iguassu"/>

The same word is spelled Iguazú in Spanish and Yguasu in Guarani.

===Literature===
The region that today is part of Foz do Iguaçu, is described by [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]] in his diary that narrates the very experience at the beginning of the European colonization in the Americas. In contemporary literature one of the city's neighborhoods appears in a subjective way in the work of the writer Leonid R. Bózio, who reports in the book ''Tempos Sombrios'',<ref>BÓZIO, Leonid. Autofagia: livro I Tempos Sombrios. Brasília: Amazon, 2018. {{ISBN|978-85-923882-1-8}}</ref> from the series ''Autofagia'', local mysticism through the figure of ''Pombero'', creature of the [[Guarani mythology|Guarani Mythology]].

[[File:Templobudista 395.jpg|right|thumb|Buddhist temple]]
The city has a population of approximately 265,000, whilst the Tríplice Fronteira (Tri Frontier) region (Ciudad del Este, Hernandarias, Puerto Iguazú and the rural areas included within those municipalities) has a population of 820,000. The city's population is heterogeneous, with many immigrant communities, such as: [[Arabs]], [[Chinese race|Chinese]], [[Germans]], [[Italians]], [[Paraguayans]], [[Argentina|Argentines]], [[French people|French]], [[Swedish people|Swedes]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[Ukrainians]].

The residents are predominantly [[Roman Catholic]] but there is a relatively large minority of [[Muslims]] and Buddhists. The city has a large mosque and a Buddhist temple.

Fenartec is an annual event held in May to commemorate the city's multicultural diversity.

===Arab influence===
Since 1940, Lebanese and other Arabs have settled in the southwestern city of Foz do Iguaçu, in the "Triple Border" area where Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil converge in a region of loosely controlled borders.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/jul/11/20050711-092503-1255r/?page=2|title=Arab roots grow deep in Brazil's rich melting pot|newspaper=The Washington Times|access-date=5 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072925/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/jul/11/20050711-092503-1255r/?page=2|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

People of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese heritage]] constitute around 90% of the population from [[Middle East]] in the city, with others from [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Syria]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].

== Transportation ==
[[File:IGU terminal land side.jpg|thumb|right|[[Foz do Iguaçu International Airport]], terminal land side]]

[[File:Tripla_Fronteira._Paraguai,_Brasil_e_Arxentina.jpg|thumb|right|Tri-border area between [[Brazil]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Argentina]].]]
Foz do Iguaçu is connected to the east by the [[BR-277]], to [[Paranaguá]], and to the west by the [[Friendship Bridge (Brazil-Paraguay)|Friendship Bridge]] to [[Ciudad del Este]], and to the south to Puerto Iguazú by the [[Tancredo Neves Bridge|Fraternity Bridge]]. Both the BR-277 and the Friendship Bridge are very busy roads, linking Paraguay to the Paranaguá's seaport.

The city is served by [[Foz do Iguaçu International Airport|Foz do Iguaçu/Cataratas International Airport]]. Nearby options are [[Cataratas del Iguazú International Airport]] in [[Puerto Iguazú]], [[Argentina]] and [[Guaraní International Airport]] in [[Ciudad del Este]], [[Paraguay]].

=== Public transport ===
The city does not operate its own municipal transport networks, but instead licenses four private bus companies to operate services on its behalf. The bus fares are set by the municipality for all four companies. In 2003, the city initiated an integrated city fare and created a hub near the city centre.

Now, most of the bus routes pass through this hub and passengers pay a standard fare within the city zone, which enables them to transfer routes, even when these may be operated by another company.

The transport network extends to certain distant areas, such as the city's airport and the Iguazu Park, but not between the city and its neighbor Ciudad del Este, nor with Puerto Iguazú, which are serviced by other companies. These routes are not part of the integrated network, a situation reflected by higher fares.

=== Avenida Brasil (Brazil Avenue) ===
Since Foz do Iguaçu's foundation, Brazil Avenue is the city's main road. While during its early years the street was primarily the military headquarters' location (now they are just in the right beginning of the Avenue), nowadays the street is a very active place where many retail stores are located. It is located at the downtown of the city and it is 5&nbsp;km (3&nbsp;mi) long (of which 3&nbsp;km, {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}}, is arterial road).<ref name="iguassu"/>

As of 2004, the prefecture of the city decided that a major revitalization of "Avenida Brasil" (Brazil Avenue) was needed. Attracting many consumers from many different areas of the city and even from its neighbours Ciudad del Este and Puerto Iguazú, the avenue, wide enough only to support two cars side-by-side, is frequently used during business days, and even more in important holidays ([[Christmas]], Children's day, [[Easter]], Mother's day), with many cars competing for a parking space.<ref name="iguassu"/>

The revitalization proposals asks for removal of parking space, giving major attention to [[pedestrians]]. Also, the avenue would be wide enough only to support one car side by side. The project started at the end of 2004, and by 2006 was completed. The avenue does not have a bus route, by [[municipal]] order.<ref name="iguassu"/>

==Education==
The city has a [[literacy]] rate of 95.5%, with most children attending public or private schools. Public education has been a priority of the municipality of the city and the government of the state of Paraná; however, most middle and upper-class families continue to send their children to elite private schools.

The city has approximately 30 private schools and approximately 120 public schools (including daycare and kindergarten schools). In addition, there are 7 universities: 
*Cesufoz; 
*UDC;
*Uniamérica;
*Unifoz; 
*Unioeste; 
*Anglo-Americano Faculdades;
*IFPR (Technical Institute).

In January 2010, the [[Universidade Federal da Integração Latino-Americana]] (UNILA) was founded.
