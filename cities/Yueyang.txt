==History==
The area now called Yueyang has been inhabited for over 3,000 years.  It was originally established as a [[Prefectures of China|prefecture]] called Hanchang (Hanchang) by [[Eastern Wu|Sun Wu]] in 210 AD during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period. It was called Ximi during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and [[Warring States period]] under the [[Chu (state)|Chu state]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Yueyang {{!}} China|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Yueyang|access-date=2021-06-09|website=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|language=en}}</ref>

Under the [[Song dynasty]] (AD 960 – AD 1279) it was heavily fortified, with walls {{convert|4|mi|km}} in circumference, and became the seat of the military prefecture of Yueyang, whence its present name. During the [[Taiping Rebellion]], its capture by the rebels in AD 1852 was an important stage in their advance up the [[Yangtze River valley]] to [[Nanjing]]. At the time of the foundation of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in AD 1911, it became a county, taking the name Yueyang.

==Yueyang Tower==
