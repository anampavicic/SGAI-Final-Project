[[File:Okinawa City downtown.jpg|thumb|Okinawa City downtown]]
{{nihongo|'''Okinawa City'''|沖縄市|Okinawa-shi|extra={{IPA|ja|okinawa|lang}}}} is the second-largest [[Cities of Japan|city]] in [[Okinawa Prefecture]], [[Japan]], following [[Naha, Okinawa|Naha]], the capital city.<ref name="e" /> It is located in the central part of the island of [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]], about {{Convert|20|km|mi}} north of Naha. As of 1 October 2020, the city has an estimated [[population]] of 142,752 and a [[population density]] of 2,913.31 people per km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="pop" /> The total area is 49.00&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.

==History==
Under the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] the present-day area of Okinawa City was occupied by two [[magiri]], a type of administrative district. The Goeku magiri occupied the south of the city, and the north of the city was part of the Misato magiri.<ref name="koza" />

In 1908, Okinawa Prefecture ended the magiri system and established the villages of Goeku and Misato. Both villages were agricultural and lacked urbanized areas prior to [[World War II]].<ref name="n" />

After the [[Battle of Okinawa]] the United States established the first refugee camp in Okinawa in the area south of present-day Kadena Air Base. The population of the former villages swelled rapidly. An area of Goeku, called ''Goya'' (ごや), was mispronounced by Americans as ''Koza'' (コザ). During the occupation of Okinawa, the U.S. military government established the city of {{nihongo|Koza|コザ市|Koza-shi}} in Goeku. Koza was the first city to use the [[katakana]] [[syllabary]] for its name.<ref name="koza" /> Misato merged into a neighboring community, and in 1946, again became separate, as did Goeku. Both municipalities, which were formerly largely agricultural, became heavily urbanized as a result of the construction of refugee camps and the establishment of large-scale military bases. The area became a "base city" catering to United States military personnel.<ref name="n" /> On June 13, 1956, Goeku changed its name to the village of Koza; on July 1 of the same year it became a city.<ref name="koza" />

The city of Okinawa was the site of the [[Koza riot]] on the night of December 20, 1970. Roughly 5,000 Okinawans came into violent contact with roughly 700 American [[military police|MPs]]. Approximately 60 Americans were injured and 75 cars were burned. Additionally, several buildings on [[Kadena Air Base]] were destroyed or heavily damaged. The Koza riot was considered a symbol of Okinawan anger after 25 years of US military occupation. The riot was unexpected, and strained the ongoing negotiations on the end of the [[United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands|United States administration of Okinawa]].<ref name="riot-n" /><ref name="riot-k" />

The city of Okinawa was founded on April 1, 1974 with the merger of Koza and Misato.<ref name="e" />

==Geography==
{{expand section|date=September 2015}}
The commercial center of the city lies along [[Route 330 (Japan)|Route 330]]. It extends from Goya Crossing to Koza Crossing. The district extending from Goya to the gate of [[Kadena Air Base]], and Chūō Park Avenue, has many visitors from the U.S. military, and many shops have signs in both Japanese and English. However, the development of large shopping centers in nearby communities has resulted in some decline in these areas.<ref name="e"/>

===Administrative divisions===
The city includes forty-six wards.<ref>{{Cite web |title=沖縄県 沖縄市の郵便番号 - 日本郵便 |url=https://www.post.japanpost.jp/cgi-zip/zipcode.php?pref=47&city=1472110 |access-date=2024-10-03 |website=www.post.japanpost.jp}}</ref>
