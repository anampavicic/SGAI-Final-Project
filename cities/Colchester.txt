The main campus of the [[University of Essex]] is located between Colchester and [[Wivenhoe]]. Local government is the responsibility of the [[City of Colchester]] and [[Essex County Council]].

==Name==
There are several theories about the origin of the name ''Colchester''.  Some contend that is derived from the [[Latin]] words ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'' (referring to a type of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlement with rights equivalent to those of Roman citizens, one of which was believed to have been founded in the vicinity of Colchester) and ''[[castra]]'', meaning ''fortifications'' (referring to the city walls, the oldest in Britain).<ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997">Crummy, Philip (1997) City of Victory; the story of Colchester – Britain's first Roman town. Published by Colchester Archaeological Trust ({{ISBN|1 897719 04 3}})</ref><ref name="Ashdown">Ashdown-Hill, John (2009). Mediaeval Colchester's Lost Landmarks. Published by The Breedon Books Publishing Company Limited. ({{ISBN|978-1-85983-686-6}})</ref> The earliest forms of the name Colchester are ''Colenceaster'' and ''Colneceastre'' from the 10th century, with the modern spelling of ''Colchester'' being found in the 15th century.<ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/> In this way of interpreting the name, the [[River Colne, Essex|River Colne]] which runs through the area takes its name from ''Colonia'' as well.<ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/> [[Cologne]] (German ''Köln'') also gained its name from a similar etymology (from its Roman name [[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium]]).<ref name="Ashdown"/>

Other etymologists are confident that the Colne's name is pre-Roman, sharing its origin with several other rivers Colne or Clun around Britain, and that Colchester is derived from ''Colne'' and ''Castra''. [[Eilert Ekwall|Ekwall]] went as far as to say "it has often been held that Colchester contains as first element [Latin] ''colonia'' ... this derivation is ruled out of court by the fact that Colne is the name of several old villages situated a good many miles from Colchester and on the Colne. The identification of Colonia with Colchester is doubtful."<ref name="Ekwall">Eilert Ekwall (1928). English River-names. Published by Oxford at the Clarendon Press. ({{ISBN|9780198691198}})</ref>

The popular association of the name with [[King Coel]] has no academic merit.

{{Main|History of Colchester}}

===Prehistory===
The gravel hill upon which Colchester is built was formed in the [[Middle Pleistocene]] period, and was shaped into a [[River terrace|terrace]] between the [[Anglian glaciation]] and the [[Ipswichian]] [[glaciation]] by an ancient precursor to the [[River Colne, Essex|River Colne]].<ref name="Crummy, Philip 1992">Crummy, Philip (1992) Colchester Archaeological Report 6: Excavations at Culver Street, the Gilberd School, and other sites in Colchester 1971–85.

Colchester is said to be the [[Oldest town in Britain|oldest recorded town]] in Britain on the grounds that it was mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]], who died in AD 79,<ref>Pliny, ''Naturalis Historia'', II, 187</ref> although the Celtic name of the town, ''Camulodunon'' appears on coins minted by tribal chieftain [[Tasciovanus]] in the period 20{{ndash}}10 BC.<ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/> Before the Roman conquest of Britain it was already a centre of power for [[Cunobelin]]{{snd}} known to Shakespeare as [[Cymbeline]]{{snd}} king of the [[Catuvellauni]] (c. 5 BC{{snd}}AD 40), who minted coins there.<ref>P. Salway, ''Roman Britain'' (Oxford University Press: Oxford, 1981), pp. 55–6</ref> Its [[Celt]]ic name, Camulodunon, variously represented as CA, CAM, CAMV, CAMVL and CAMVLODVNO on the coins of Cunobelinus, means 'the fortress of [the war god] [[Camulos]]'.<ref>V.

===Roman period===
{{Main|Camulodunum}}
[[File:The Roman Town Wall, Head Street to the Balkerne Gate 3.JPG|thumb|Part of the Roman walls in Colchester]]

Soon after the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] in AD 43, a Roman legionary fortress was established,<ref>J. Nelson, ed., ''The Victoria History of the County of Essex'', IX (Oxford University Press: Oxford, 1994), pp. 7–10</ref> the first in Britain.<ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/> Later, when the Roman frontier moved outwards and the twentieth legion had moved to the west (c. AD 49), Camulodunum became a [[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]] named in a second-century inscription as ''Colonia Victricensis''. This contained a large and elaborate [[Temple of Claudius, Colchester|Temple to the Divine Claudius]],<ref>Nelson, ed. ''V.C.H. Essex'', IX, p. 10</ref> the largest [[Roman Temple|classical-style temple]] in Britain, as well as at least seven other Romano-British temples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roman-britain.co.uk/places/colchester_temples/|title=Temple of Claudius at Camulodunon (Colchester)|website=Roman-britain.co.uk|access-date=20 July 2014}}</ref> Colchester is home to two of the five [[Roman theatre (structure)|Roman theatres]] found in Britain; the example at Gosbecks (site of the [[Trinovantes|Iron Age]] royal farmstead) is the largest in [[Great Britain|Britain]], able to seat 5,000.<ref name="Crummy, Philip 1997"/>

Camulodunum served as a provincial Roman capital of Britain, but was attacked and destroyed during [[Boudica]]'s rebellion in AD 61.<ref>Salway, ''Roman Britain'', pp. 89–90, 117–18</ref> Sometime after the destruction, London became the capital of the province of [[Britannia]].<ref>Salway, ''Roman Britain'', p. 530</ref> Colchester's city walls c. 3,000&nbsp;yd. long were built c.65–80 A.D. when the Roman town was rebuilt after the Boudicca rebellion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=21995 |title=Walls and Gates British History |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |access-date=17 January 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102061835/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=21995 |archive-date=2 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 2004, Colchester Archaeological Trust discovered the remains of a Roman Circus (chariot race track) underneath the Garrison in Colchester, a unique find in Britain.<ref>D.

===Sub-Roman and Saxon period===
There is evidence of hasty re-organisation of Colchester's defences around 268–82 AD, followed later, during the fourth century, by the blocking of the Balkerne Gate.<ref>J. Cooper, ed., ''The Victoria History of the County of Essex, IX: The Borough of Colchester'' (Oxford University Press: Oxford, 1995), pp. 16–17, 248</ref> [[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]] suggested that the name [[Camelot]] of Arthurian legend was probably a reference to [[Camulodunum]], the capital of [[Britannia]] in Roman times.<ref>J. Morris, ''The Age of Arthur: A History of the British Isles from 350 to 650'', 3 vols (Phillimore: Chichester, 1977), I, p. 138</ref>

The archaeologist [[Mortimer Wheeler|Sir Mortimer Wheeler]] was the first to propose that the lack of early [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] finds in a triangle between London, Colchester and [[St Albans]] could indicate a 'sub-Roman triangle' where British rule continued after the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons.<ref>R. E. M. Wheeler, ''London and the Saxons'' (London, 1935)</ref> Since then excavations have revealed some early Saxon occupation, including a fifth-century wooden hut built on the ruins of a Roman house in present-day Lion Walk. Archaeological excavations have shown that public buildings were abandoned, and is very doubtful whether Colchester survived as a settlement with any urban characteristics after the sixth century.<ref>J. N. L. Myres, ''The English Settlements'' (Oxford University Press: Oxford, 1986), p. 214</ref>

The chronology of its revival is obscure. But the ninth-century ''Historia Brittonum'', attributed to [[Nennius]], mentions the town, which it calls ''Cair Colun'', in a list of the thirty most important cities in Britain.<ref>''Nennius'', ed. J. Morris (Phillimore: London and Chichester, 1980); Watts, ''Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names'', p. 149</ref> Colchester was in the area assigned to the [[Danelaw]] in c.880, and remained in Danish hands until 917 when it was besieged and recaptured by the army of [[Edward the Elder]].<ref>D, Hill, ''An Atlas of Anglo-Saxon History'' (Blackwell: Oxford, 1981), pp. 47, 56–8; ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', trans. G. N. Garmondsway, 2nd edition (Dent: London, 1954), p. 103; F, Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', 2nd edition, (Clarendon Press: Oxford, 1947), pp. 324–5</ref> The tenth-century Saxons called the town ''Colneceastre'', which is directly equivalent to the ''Cair Colun'' of 'Nennius'.<ref>Watts, ''Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names'', p. 149</ref>  The tower of Holy Trinity Church is late Saxon work.

===Medieval and Tudor periods===
[[File:Colchester castle 800.jpg|thumb|Colchester Castle, completed c. 1100 AD]]
Medieval Colchester's main landmark is [[Colchester Castle]], which is an 11th-century Norman keep, and built on top of the vaults of the old [[Roman temple]]. There are notable medieval ruins in Colchester, including the surviving gateway of the [[Benedictine]] [[St. John's Abbey, Colchester|abbey of St John the Baptist]] (known locally as "St John's Abbey"), and the ruins of the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[priory]] of [[St Botolph]] (known locally as "[[St Botolph's Priory]]"). Many of [[Colchester churches|Colchester's parish churches]] date from this period.

Colchester's medieval town seal incorporated the biblical text ''Intravit ihc: in quoddam castellum et mulier quedam excepit illum'' 'Jesus entered a certain castle and a woman there welcomed him' (Luke 10.38).  This is a commonplace allegory in which a castle is likened to Mary's womb, and explains the name of Maidenburgh St, neighbouring the castle.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Briggs |first1=Keith |title=Maidenburgh, Geoffrey of Wells and Rabanus Maurus |journal=Nomina |date=2010 |volume=33 |pages=121–128 |url=http://snsbi.org.uk/Nomina_articles/Nomina_33_Briggs.pdf}}</ref>

In 1189, Colchester was granted its first known [[royal charter]] by King Richard I ([[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]]), although the wording suggests that it was based on an earlier one. It granted Colchester's [[Burgess (title)|burgess]]es the right to elect [[Bailiff#Historic bailiffs|bailiffs]] and a [[Judge#England and Wales|justice]].<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Cooper |editor1-first=Janet |editor2-last=Elrington |editor2-first=C.

Colchester developed rapidly during the later 14th century as a centre of the woollen cloth industry, and became famous in many parts of Europe for its russets (fabrics of a grey-brown colour). This allowed the population to recover exceptionally rapidly from the effects of the [[Black Death]], particularly by immigration into the town.<ref name="R.H. Britnell, 1986">{{cite book |first=R.

[[File:Colchester Map 1500AD.png|thumb|left|Colchester in 1500 AD]]
By the 'New Constitutions' of 1372, a borough council was instituted; the two [[bailiff]]s who represented the borough to the king were now expected to consult sixteen ordinary councillors and eight auditors (later called aldermen). Even though Colchester's fortunes were more mixed during the 15th century, it was still a more important place by the 16th century than it had been in the 13th. In 1334 it would not have ranked among England's wealthiest fifty towns, to judge from the taxation levied that year. By 1524, however, it ranked twelfth, as measured by its assessment to a lay subsidy.<ref name="R.H. Britnell, 1986"/>

In the reign of "Bloody Mary" (1553–1558) Colchester became a centre of Protestant "heresy" and in consequence at least 19 local people were burned at the stake at the castle, at first in front, later within the walls. They are commemorated on a tablet near the altar of St Peter's Church.

===17th and 18th century===
[[File:Lucas and Lise.jpg|thumb|The place of the execution of [[Charles Lucas]] and [[George Lisle (Royalist)|George Lisle]]]]
The town saw the start of the [[Stour Valley riots]] of 1642, when the town house of [[John Lucas, 1st Baron Lucas of Shenfield]] was attacked by a large crowd. In 1648, during the [[Second English Civil War]], a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] army led by [[George Goring, 1st Earl of Norwich|Lord Goring]] entered the town. A pursuing [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] army led by [[Thomas Fairfax]] and [[Henry Ireton]] surrounded the town for eleven and a half weeks, a period known as the [[Siege of Colchester]]. It started on 13 June. The Royalists surrendered in the late summer (on 27 August Lord Goring signed the surrender document in the Kings Head Inn) and [[Charles Lucas]] and [[George Lisle (Royalist)|George Lisle]] were executed in the grounds of [[Colchester Castle]].<ref>''The English Civil War: a military history of the three civil wars, 1642–1651'', Young, Peter and Holmes, Richard (1974) p. 290. Available here [https://books.google.com/books?id=_VsJAQAAIAAJ]</ref> A small obelisk marks the spot where they fell.

[[Daniel Defoe]] mentions in ''A tour through [[England and Wales]]'' that the town lost 5259 people<ref name=Defoe/> to the [[Great Plague of London|plague]] in 1665, ''"more in proportion than any of its neighbours, or than the city of London"''.<ref name=Defoe>Daniel Defoe, ''A tour through England and Wales'', J.M.

Between 1797 and 1815 Colchester was the HQ of the Army's Eastern District, had a garrison of up to 6,000, and played a main role in defence against a threatened French or Dutch invasion, At various times it was the base of such celebrated officers as Lord Cornwallis, Generals Sir James Craig and David Baird, and Captain William Napier. It was in a state of alarm during the invasion threat of 1803/4, a period well chronicled by the contemporary local author Jane Taylor.

Significant Victorian landmarks include [[Colchester Town Hall]], the [[Jumbo Water Tower]] and the [[Albert Hall, Colchester|Albert Hall]].<ref>{{NHLE|num=1337737|desc=The Albert Hall|access-date=9 May 2023}}</ref>

In 1884, the area was struck by the [[1884 Colchester earthquake|Colchester earthquake]], estimated to have been 4.7 on the [[Richter Scale]] causing extensive regional damage.

The [[Paxman diesels]] business has been associated with Colchester since 1865 when James Noah Paxman founded a partnership with the brothers Henry and Charles Davey ('Davey, Paxman, and Davey') and opened the Standard Ironworks. In 1925, Paxman produced its first spring injection oil engine and joined the English Electric Diesel Group in 1966{{snd}}later becoming part of the GEC Group. Since the 1930s the Paxman company's main business has been the production of [[diesel engine]]s.

In the early 20th century Colchester lobbied to be the seat for a new [[Church of England]] [[diocese]] for [[Essex]], to be split off from the existing [[Diocese of Rochester]]. The bid was unsuccessful, with county town Chelmsford forming the seat of [[Diocese of Chelmsford|the new diocese]].<ref name=ModernColchester>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=21986&strquery=colchester|title=Modern Colchester: Introduction|editor1=Janet Cooper|editor2=C R Elrington|author1=A P Baggs|author2=Beryl Board|author3=Philip Crummy|author4=Claude Dove|author5=Shirley Durgan|author6=N R Goose|author7=R B Pugh|author8=Pamela Studd|author9=C C Thornton|work=A History of the County of Essex: Volume 9: The Borough of Colchester|publisher=Institute of Historical Research|year=1994|access-date=28 July 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102061923/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=21986&strquery=colchester|archive-date=2 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In the 2nd World War Colchester's main significance lay in its infantry and light-anti-aircraft training units, and in the Paxman factory, which supplied a large proportion of the engines for British submarines and landing craft. Occasionally hit by stray single German aircraft in 1940 and 1941, in 1942 more serious attempts to bomb its industries were made by the Luftwaffe. None of these attacks hit their targets, but a raid on 11 August bombed [[Severalls Hospital]], and killed 38 elderly patients. In February 1944 a single raider caused a huge fire in the St Botolph's area which gutted warehouses, shops and part of Paxman's Britannia Works. The total wartime bombing death toll in the borough was 55.<ref>(Sources:--Eastern Command, 11 Corps, various divisional, brigade and battalion, and Colchester Garrison war diaries in WO 166 series at National Archives, Kew; 4 Civil Defence Region reports in HO 192/193 series at National Archives; CW 1 Police Incident records at Essex County Record Office).</ref>

==Climate==
{{Main|Climate of the United Kingdom}}
Colchester is in one of the driest regions of the United Kingdom with average annual precipitation at {{convert|635|mm|in|1|abbr=in}}, although among the wetter places in Essex. Colchester is generally regarded as having an [[Oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') like the rest of the United Kingdom. Its easterly position within the British Isles makes Colchester less prone to Atlantic depressions and weather fronts but more prone to droughts. This is because, like most areas in southeast England, Colchester's weather is influenced more by Continental weather patterns than by Atlantic weather systems. This leads to a dry climate compared to the rest of the UK all year round and occasional (relative) extremes of temperatures during the year (occasional high 20&nbsp;°Cs/low 30&nbsp;°Cs during the summer) and quite a few nights below freezing during the winter months (daytime high temperatures are seldom below freezing). Any rainfall that does come from Atlantic weather systems is usually light, but a few heavy showers and [[thunderstorm]]s can take place during the summer. Snow falls on average 13 days a year during winter and early spring.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The highest temperature recorded in Colchester was {{convert|36.1|°C|0|abbr=on}} in August 2003 (during the [[2003 European heat wave]]), and the lowest was {{convert|-9.4|°C|0|abbr=on}} in December 2010.

[[File:The Roman Town Wall, East Hill to Queen Street 2.JPG|thumb|right|A surviving fragment of the Roman Town Wall in East Hill]]
Construction of the walls of Colchester took place between 65 and 80 [[AD]], shortly after the destruction of the undefended ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'' by Boudicca, and they continued in use until after the Siege of Colchester in 1648. Two large stretches of the wall are still standing on the west and north sides and a number of fragments are visible along the rest of the circuit. A notable survival is the [[Balkerne Gate]], which is the earliest and most complete Roman gateway in the United Kingdom. A circular walk of nearly {{convert|2|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} follows the course of the wall and the surviving portions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walkcolchester.org.uk/assets/r/o/romanwalls_100815.pdf |title=Walk Colchester – A Guide to Colchester's Roman Wall |website=Walkcolchester.org.uk |access-date=2 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091859/http://www.walkcolchester.org.uk/assets/r/o/romanwalls_100815.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Transport==

===Buses===
Colchester's bus services are operated primarily by [[First Essex]] and [[Arriva Colchester]], as well as by [[Hedingham & Chambers]], Beeston's, [[Ipswich Buses]], [[Stephensons of Essex]] and Panther Travel (Essex). The bus station is located in Osborne Street, on the southern edge of the centre. Key routes include the 371 to [[Chelmsford]] and the 74 to [[Clacton-on-Sea]].

===Railway===
[[Colchester Town railway station|Colchester Town]] and [[Hythe (Essex) railway station|Hythe]] stations are on the [[Sunshine Coast Line]] operated by [[Greater Anglia (train operating company)|Greater Anglia]], and linked to the rest of the network at [[Colchester railway station|Colchester North station]], which lies just outside this area.

===Roads===
Colchester is linked to [[London]] and [[East Anglia]] by the [[A12 road (England)|A12]], which bypasses the town to the north and east, and is the region's main trunk route. The [[A120 road|A120]] connects Colchester with [[Harwich]] in the east and [[Stansted Airport]] and the [[M11 motorway]] in the west.

===Port===
Colchester was historically a port, with a regular weekly shipping service to London by 1637, and about 3,000 vessels per year using the port in 1892.<ref>{{cite web |title=Colchester and the Thames Estuary... |url=https://catuk.org/colchester-and-the-thames-estuary/ |website=Colchester Archaeological Trust |access-date=10 July 2023 |date=18 September 2016}}</ref>  The former quay of The Hythe is no longer in use, partly because the river has silted up, although Colchester is still a registered port (code GBCOL).<ref>{{cite web |title=Ports.org.uk / Colchester |url=https://ports.org.uk/port.asp?id=80 |website=ports.org.uk |access-date=10 July 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Colchester |url=https://www.fleetmon.com/ports/colchester_gbcol_5865/?language=en |publisher=FleetMon |access-date=10 July 2023}}</ref>

==References in literature==
The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] historian [[Tacitus]] mentions Colchester (Camulodunum) in ''The Annals of Imperial Rome''. In Book XIV he describes how '...the Roman ex-soldiers...had recently established a settlement at Camulodunum', later burned down in the Iceni rebellion.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annales'', XIV, 31</ref>

It is the only town in Britain to have been explicitly mentioned in [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' as being the target of a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]] during the (fictional) Atomic Wars of the 1950s.

==In popular culture==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2019}} 
Colchester is reputed to be the home of three of the best known English nursery rhymes: '[[Old King Cole]]', '[[Humpty Dumpty]]' and '[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star|Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star]]', although the legitimacy of all three claims is disputed.<ref name=Cooper/>

Local legend places Colchester as the seat of [[King Cole]] (or Coel) of the rhyme ''Old King Cole'', a legendary ancient king of Britain. The name Colchester is from [[Latin]]: the place-name suffixes ''chester'', ''cester'', and ''caster'' derive from the Latin word ''[[castrum]]'' (fortified place). In folk etymology the name Colchester was thought of as meaning Cole's Castle {{who|date=August 2017}}, though this theory does not have academic support. In the legend Helena, the daughter of Cole, married the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[senator]] [[Constantius Chlorus]], who had been sent by Rome as an ambassador and was named as Cole's successor. Helena's son became Emperor [[Constantine I]]. Helena was canonised as [[Saint]] [[Helena of Constantinople]] and is credited with finding the [[true cross]] and the remains of [[biblical magi|the Magi]]. She is now the patron saint of Colchester. This is recognised in the emblem of Colchester: a cross and three crowns. The Mayor's medallion contains a Byzantine style icon of Saint Helena. A local secondary school&nbsp;– St Helena's&nbsp;– is named after her, and her statue is atop the town hall, although local legend is that it was originally a statue of Blessed Virgin Mary which was later fitted with a cross.

Colchester is a widely credited source{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} of the rhyme [[Humpty Dumpty]]. During the siege of Colchester in the Civil War, a Royalist sniper known as One-Eyed Thompson sat in the belfry of the church of St Mary-at-the-Walls (''Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall'') and was given the nickname Humpty Dumpty, most likely because of his size, ''Humpty Dumpty'' being a common insult for the overweight. Thompson was shot down (''Humpty Dumpty had a great fall'') and, shortly after, the town was lost to the Parliamentarians (''all the king's horses and all the king's men / couldn't put Humpty together again.'') Another version says that Humpty Dumpty was a cannon on the top of the church. The church of St Mary-at-the-Walls still retains its Norman tower until the top few feet, which are a Georgian repair.

The third rhyme said to have come from Colchester is [[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]], which was written by [[Jane Taylor (poet)|Jane Taylor]]  who lived in the Dutch Quarter, and published in 1806 with the title "The Star".

Colchester has also been suggested as one of the potential sites of [[Camelot]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Nash Ford|first=David|title=Early British Kingdoms: Colchester|url=http://www.earlybritishkingdoms.com/archaeology/colchester.html|access-date=25 April 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211112608/http://www.earlybritishkingdoms.com/archaeology/colchester.html|archive-date=11 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> on account of having been the capital of Roman Britain and its ancient name of ''Camulodunum'': this is not considered likely by academics, as in Arthurian times Colchester was under Saxon control.
