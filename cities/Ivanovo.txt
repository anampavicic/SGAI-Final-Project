'''Ivanovo''' ({{langx|ru|Иваново}}, {{IPA|ru|ɪˈvanəvə|IPA}}) is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] in [[Russia]]. It is the [[administrative center]] and largest city of [[Ivanovo Oblast]], located {{convert|254|km|sp=us}} northeast of [[Moscow]] and approximately {{convert|100|km|sp=us}} from [[Yaroslavl]], [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] and [[Kostroma]]. Ivanovo has a population of 361,644 as of the 2021 Census,<ref name=2021Census>{{cite web|title=Оценка численности постоянного населения по субъектам Российской Федерации|url=https://rosstat.gov.ru/storage/mediabank/tab-5_VPN-2020.xlsx|publisher=[[Federal State Statistics Service (Russia)|Federal State Statistics Service]]|accessdate=1 September 2022}}</ref> making it the [[List of cities and towns in Russia by population|50th largest city in Russia]]. Until 1932, it was previously known as ''Ivanovo-Voznesensk''.{{efn|{{langx|ru|Ива́ново-Вознесе́нск|links=no}}}}<ref name="about"/> It is the youngest city of the [[Golden Ring of Russia]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Voskanyan |first=Yana |date=2021-08-10 |title=The Golden Ring of Russia |url=https://www.ruslinguaschool.com/post/the-golden-ring-of-russia |access-date=2022-06-17 |website=Ruslingua School |language=en}}</ref>

The city lies on the [[Uvod River]], in the centre of the eponymous oblast. Ivanovo gained city status in 1871, emerged as a major center for [[textile]] production, and began to be referred to as the "Russian [[Manchester]]".<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/place/Ivanovo-Russia Ivanovo]. [[Britannica]].</ref> The city is served by [[Ivanovo Yuzhny Airport]].

==Geography==
The [[Uvod River]], a [[tributary]] of the [[Klyazma River|Klyazma]], flows from north to south, dividing the city into two halves. There are also two rivers in Ivanovo: the [[Talka River|Talka]] and the [[Kharinka River|Kharinka]].

==Climate==
Ivanovo has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb''). The city has warm summers with temperatures reaching over 30 °C and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The lowest air temperature ever recorded is -46°C (January 1940). The warmest month is July with a daily mean of 18.9°C, the coldest month is January with a daily mean of -8.7°C. The highest amount of precipitation is on average in July with 70 mm of precipitation, the driest is March with 34 mm of precipitation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Climate norms|url=https://meteoinfo.ru/climatcities |access-date=2024-01-06|language=ru}}</ref>

==History==
{{stack|[[File:Фабрика-кухня «Нарпит» в Иванове.jpg|thumb|The first [[factory-kitchen]] in the USSR was built in Ivanovo]]}}
The city is first mentioned in 1561,{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} when it was given to the Cherkassky princely family by [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan&nbsp;IV]], after the latter's marriage to Maria Cherkasskaya. However, the relevant document has since been lost.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

The modern city was created by merging the old [[flax]]-processing village Ivanovo with the industrial [[Voznesensky Posad]] in 1871.<ref name="about">{{cite web|title=General Information|url=http://ivgoradm.ru/menu/nashgorod.htm|publisher=Ivanovo Oblast|language=ru|access-date=September 3, 2017}}</ref> Yakov Garelin—a patron of arts, historian, manufacturer, and public figure—is considered to be the founder of the city and its second head. Under his leadership, the city began to develop, industrialise, and grow.

Until 1932, the official name of the city was '''Ivanovo-Voznesensk'''.<ref name="about"/> Because of its textile manufacturing industry, Ivanovo earned the sobriquet of the "Russian Manchester" during the 19th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cookson|first=Roy|title=A World of Manchesters|year=2002|publisher=Casthermen Books|isbn=0-9542404-0-5|page=111}}</ref>

By the early 20th century, Ivanovo was competing with [[Łódź]] (also a part of the [[Russian Empire]] at that time) for the title of the primary textile production center of Europe. As the workers' living conditions were appalling, the strikes were frequent. One of these strikes (May&nbsp;14-July&nbsp;22, 1905) led to the [[Revolution of 1905|first Russian revolution]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} According to the [[historiography in the Soviet Union|Soviet historiography]],<ref>e.g., the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' article "Soviets of Workers' Deputies"</ref> the Ivanovo Soviet (created on May&nbsp;28, 1905) was one of the first [[soviet (council)|soviets]] in history. 

In 1937, the city opened the [[Interdom]] - a school for children of foreign Communists, including high learning.

In Ivanov, the legendary air squadron (then - known as a Regiment) "[[Normandie-Niemen]]" began operations. By agreement between the Soviet government and the "Free French" government-in-exile in late 1942, a group of French pilots was sent to the Soviet Union. Construction of a new airport began on the northern outskirts of the city. The pilots were provided with decent housing, and 14 [[Yak-1]] fighter aircraft. During 1943, the French fought alongside the [[Soviet Air Forces]]. Ivanov/Ivanovo was bombed in the [[World War II]] and fought over, briefly in the [[Russian Civil War]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

After the war, along with the continued textile industry in Ivanovo engineering and other industries developed.<ref>Глебов Ю. Ф., Лешуков Т. Н. Иваново. Путеводитель. — Ярославль: Верх.-Волж. кн. изд-во, 1981. — 256 с. — 50 000 экз. — ISBN, ББК 26.89 (2Р344—2)</ref> In the 1960s, the city became the center of the Upper-Economic Council. The 1980s saw the accelerated pace of housing construction.

On June 9, 1984, Ivanovo was struck by an F4 tornado which killed at least 69 people and injured more than 130 others. Some estimates indicate up to 95 deaths. The tornado damaged, destroyed or leveled more than 1,180 homes and became one of the worst to strike Russia. This was part of the [[1984 Soviet Union tornado outbreak]] which produced at least 11 tornadoes, with two of those being F4. In addition, the severe thunderstorms also produced hail up to 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) in weight, among the heaviest hailstones confirmed worldwide.

Since the beginning of the 21st century there has been declining production in Ivanovo. In the first decade of the century, a large number of enterprises were closed. The weaving factories BIM, BAT melange Plant and other smaller companies in the textile industry ceased to exist.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Ivanovo is the [[administrative center]] of the [[oblast]]<ref name="IvanovoO_adm">Law #145-OZ</ref> and, within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it also serves as the administrative center of [[Ivanovsky District, Ivanovo Oblast|Ivanovsky District]],<ref name="IvanovoO_adm" /> even though it is not a part of it.<ref name="Incorp">Law #145-OZ stipulates that the borders of the administrative districts are identical to the borders of the municipal districts. The Law #40-OZ, which describes the borders and the composition of Ivanovsky District, does not list the city of Ivanovo as a part of that district.</ref> As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the '''[[City of federal subject significance|City]] of Ivanovo'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Ivanovo Oblast|districts]].<ref name="Incorp" /> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the City of Ivanovo is incorporated as '''Ivanovo Urban Okrug'''.<ref name="IvanovoO_mun1">Law #124-OZ</ref>

==Economy==
Ivanovo gained a reputation as the [[textile]] capital of Russia during the nineteenth century. The development of the textile industry involved the importation of [[textile machinery]] from [[England]] often accompanied by supervisory staff particularly from [[Lancashire]].<ref name="B2B Chief">{{cite web |title=Bolton know how had key role in Russia's textile revolution |url=https://b2bchief.com/news/bolton-know-how-had-key-role-in-russias-textile-revolution/ |website=b2bchief.com |publisher=B2B Chief |access-date=2 April 2021}}</ref> Most textile workers are women, so it has also been known as the "city of brides". Probably the most famous of the city's female natives was the postmodern French writer [[Nathalie Sarraute]]. Also, there is a branch plant of [[AviraKids]], a Russian holding company that occupies 37,5% of the Russian gaming equipment production industry.

==Transportation==
Public transport is represented by trolleybuses, buses and taxis. The trolleybus system was opened on November&nbsp;5, 1962. The first line ran from the Bagayeva area (now [[Victory Square (Ivanovo)|Victory Square]]) to the GZIP plant. The tram was operated from November&nbsp;6, 1934 until June&nbsp;1, 2008. According to Ivanov, the former Mayor Alexander Fomin: "Over the past 20&nbsp;years, the number of vehicles in the city has increased by more than 10&nbsp;times, while traffic is 5–7&nbsp;times higher than that for which they were designed.

The system of urban bus services in Ivanovo-Voznesensk began on November&nbsp;8, 1926. The bus park was originally located on the street Paris Commune. In the early 1960s, a new bus depot was built on Prospekt Tekstilchshiki. In the Soviet period, the operation of buses and coaches exercised Ivanovskoye passenger motor company (MTE) #1, and taxi station (Ivanovo MTE-2). Ivanovo MTE-1 closed in December 2007.

It is home to [[Ivanovo Severny]], which is one of the largest military airlift bases in Russia. Civilian air services are provided at the [[Ivanovo Yuzhny Airport]]. Since 1896, there is a railway connection between Ivanovo and Moscow.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nnov-airport.ru/rus/wokzal_ivanovo.html |title=Train Station in Ivanovo |language=ru |access-date=December 2, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323173227/http://www.nnov-airport.ru/rus/wokzal_ivanovo.html |archive-date=March 23, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Many monuments are devoted to the revolutionary past of the city, such as the "Red Talka" memorial or numerous monuments to revolutionaries. The historical center of the city is notable mainly for the former houses of famous Ivanovites: the mansion houses of E. I. Gratchev (1774), I. N. Polushin (1904; here the Soviet government was first declared), K. D. Burkov, the Kuvayevs, the Gandurins, the Burylins, etc. The industrial architecture, like the remaining textile manufactures of the 19th century, is also of interest.

==The youth policy==

===History===
According to historians, the youth policy in the city started in 1892, when the first Marxist society was formed. In 1919, the city Komsomol (Young Communist League) organization was established, soon this movement spread all over the region. By the beginning of the Great Patriotic War in 1941, Ivanovo regional Komsomol organization had already had over 100 thousand people. After the war the main objectives of the movements were to bring up and educate the working youth and to organize various activities.
In 1970-1980s different circles and amateur theatres were functioning, and people's universities were established.

In the 1980s, Ivanovo Oblast became one of the largest student centers of European Russia (7 institutes of higher education and 26 colleges with about 35 thousand students).

In the 1990s, the youth policy in Ivanovo was challenged, but remained and developed, due to the activity of initiative ivanovites. In 1992, the Department of youth affairs was established. The new youth policy was being formed. New legislature and programs were launched to encourage young families, youth employment, patriotic education and support. 53 clubs of young families and 28 military-patriotic organizations were formed.
Since the beginning of the 2000s the complex youth and children's policy has been pursued, through the legislative (like the regional law “Of the state support of youth and children’s social organizations) and grant support means.

Nowadays the Department of internal affairs of the Ivanovo region is responsible for the development of the youth policy of the region.

===Development===
There are almost 98 000 young people in Ivanovo, i.e. each fourth citizen. It is one of the Russian students' centers, with 8 public and 5 private institutes of higher education, offering educational facilities both for Russian and foreign students. The city is the third largest one in the country after Moscow and the Moscow region, in terms of number of students per 10 000 citizens.

There are 18 military-patriotic clubs with about 550 young participants, 170 people are in charge of local history activities. More than 20 per cent of young citizens take part in the youth organizations’ activities, like “IMCA – Ivanovo”, Russian Youth Union, the “Novy Rubezh”, Ivanovo city pupils’ Duma, the “Shkolny Activ Goroda” (City school activists) and many others.

Annually the city holds the “Students’ spring" festival of students’ creativity. It's the most popular event in cultural life of Ivanovo students, with the participation of all universities and institutes. Since 1997, the interregional festival of students “Maslenitsa” (“Pancake week”) is held. Yearly about 20 students’ teams from 6-8 regions take part in it.

Being concerned of the youth creativeness, the city government supports the development of facilities of students’ cultural, sporting and entertainment centers, as well as organizes regional sports competitions among students.

In order to encourage young scientists, each year the best students are given the grant of the governor, which is a good support for gifted researches. To increase the academic level of the youth, the contest of students’ and postgraduates’ researches was established. The papers should be devoted to the resolution of topical problems of the region. The best authors are given the award named after M. V. Frunze.
