Pretoria straddles the [[Apies River]] and extends eastward into the foothills of the [[Magaliesberg]] mountains. It has a reputation as an academic city and center of research, being home to the [[Tshwane University of Technology]] (TUT), the [[University of Pretoria]] (UP), the [[University of South Africa]] (UNISA), the [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR), and the [[Human Sciences Research Council]]. It also hosts the [[National Research Foundation (South Africa)|National Research Foundation]] and the [[South African Bureau of Standards]]. Pretoria was one of the host cities of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].

Pretoria is the central part of the [[City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality]] which was formed by the amalgamation of several former local authorities, including [[Bronkhorstspruit]], [[Centurion, Gauteng|Centurion]], [[Cullinan, Gauteng|Cullinan]], [[Hammanskraal]] and [[Soshanguve]]. Some have proposed [[Pretoria#Proposed change of name|changing the official name from Pretoria to Tshwane]], which has caused some public controversy.

Pretoria is named after the [[Voortrekker]] leader [[Andries Pretorius]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Raper |first=Peter E. |title=Dictionary of Southern African Place Names |url=https://archive.org/stream/DictionaryOfSouthernAfricanPlaceNames/SaPlaceNames#page/n373/mode/2up |publisher=Internet Archive |access-date=28 August 2013 |page=373 |year=1987}}</ref> and South Africans sometimes call it the "Jacaranda City",<ref>{{Cite web |title=10 SA city nicknames, and why they're called that |url=https://www.news24.com/News24/10-SA-city-nicknames-and-why-theyre-called-that-20150622 |access-date=2022-07-24 |website=News24 |date=4 June 2015 |language=en-US |archive-date=24 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220724201722/https://www.news24.com/News24/10-SA-city-nicknames-and-why-theyre-called-that-20150622 |url-status=live}}</ref> because of the thousands of [[Jacaranda mimosifolia|jacaranda]] trees planted along its streets and in its parks and gardens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/aboutsa/provinces.htm#gauteng |title=South Africa's provinces: Gauteng |access-date=14 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622084057/http://www.info.gov.za/aboutsa/provinces.htm#gauteng |archive-date=22 June 2011}}</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Pretoria}}
Pretoria was founded in 1855 by [[Marthinus Wessel Pretorius|Marthinus Pretorius]], a leader of the [[Voortrekkers]], who named it after his father [[Andries Pretorius]] and chose a spot on the banks of the ''[[Apies River|Apies rivier]]'' ([[Afrikaans]] for "Monkeys river") to be the new [[capital city|capital]] of the [[South African Republic]] ({{langx|nl|Zuid Afrikaansche Republiek}}; ZAR). The elder Pretorius had become a national hero of the Voortrekkers after his victory over [[Dingane]] and the [[Zulu people|Zulu]]s in the [[Battle of Blood River]] in 1838. The elder Pretorius also negotiated the [[Sand River Convention]] (1852), in which the United Kingdom acknowledged the independence of the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. It became the capital of the South African Republic on 1 May 1860.

The founding of Pretoria as the capital of the South African Republic can be seen as marking the end of the Boers' settlement movements of the [[Great Trek]].

===Boer Wars===
{{Main|Boer Wars}}
During the [[First Boer War]], the city was besieged by Republican forces in December 1880 and March 1881. The peace treaty that ended the war was signed in Pretoria on 3 August 1881 at the [[Pretoria Convention]].

The [[Second Boer War]] resulted in the end of the [[Transvaal Republic]] and start of British [[hegemony]] in South Africa. The city surrendered to British forces under [[Frederick Sleigh Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Frederick Roberts]] on 5 June 1900 and the conflict was ended in Pretoria with the signing of the [[Peace of Vereeniging]] on 31 May 1902 at [[Melrose House]].

The [[Pretoria Forts]] were built for the defence of the city just prior to the Second Boer War. Though some of these forts are today in ruins, a number of them have been preserved as national monuments.

[[File:Union-buildings-pretoria.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Union Buildings]], seat of South Africa's government]]

===Union of South Africa===
{{Main|Union of South Africa}}
The Boer Republics of the ZAR and the [[Orange River Colony]] were united with the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] and [[Natal Colony]] in 1910 to become the [[Union of South Africa]]. Pretoria then became the administrative capital of the whole of South Africa, with [[Cape Town]] serving as the legislative capital and [[Bloemfontein]] as the judicial capital. Between 1910 and 1994, the city was also the capital of the province of [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]]. (As the capital of the ZAR, Pretoria had superseded [[Potchefstroom]] in that role.)
On 14 October 1931, Pretoria achieved official city status.<ref>South African History Online, [http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/pretoria-receives-city-status] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216183414/http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/pretoria-receives-city-status|date=16 February 2015}}, 2011]</ref> When South Africa became a republic in 1961, Pretoria remained its administrative capital.<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 54</ref>

==Geography==
Pretoria is situated approximately {{cvt|56|km|mi}} north-northeast of [[Johannesburg]] in the northeast of [[South Africa]], in a transitional belt between the plateau of the [[Highveld]] to the south and the lower-lying [[Bushveld]] to the north. It lies at an altitude of about {{cvt|1,339|m|ft}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freemaptools.com/elevation-finder.htm |title=Elevation Finder |first=Free Map |last=Tools |access-date=5 July 2014 |archive-date=26 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626104315/http://www.freemaptools.com/elevation-finder.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> in a warm, sheltered, fertile valley, surrounded by the hills of the [[Magaliesberg]] range.

===Climate===
[[File:Magaliesberg08.jpg|thumb|The city is surrounded by the [[Magaliesberg]] range.]]
Pretoria has a monsoon-influenced [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: [[Humid subtropical climate|Cwa]]) with long hot, rainy summers, and short, dry and mild winters. The city experiences the typical winters of South Africa, with cold, clear nights and mild to moderately warm days. Although the average lows during winter are mild, it can get cold due to the clear skies, with night time low temperatures in recent years in the range of {{cvt|2|to|-5|C}}.

The average annual temperature is {{cvt|18.7|°C}}.<ref>GHCN climate data, 30-year climate average 1979–2008, Goddard Institute of Space Studies</ref> This is rather high, considering the city's relatively high altitude of about {{convert|1,339|m|abbr=off}}, and is due mainly to its sheltered valley position, which acts as a heat trap and cuts it off from cool southerly and south-easterly air masses for much of the year.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Rain is chiefly concentrated in the summer months, with drought conditions prevailing over the winter months, when frosts may be sharp. Snowfall is an extremely rare event; snowflakes were spotted in 1959, 1968 and 2012 in the city, but the city has never experienced an accumulation in its history.

During a nationwide [[heat wave]] in November 2011, Pretoria experienced temperatures that reached {{cvt|39|°C|°F|0}}, unusual for that time of the year. Similar record-breaking extreme heat events also occurred in January 2013, when Pretoria experienced temperatures exceeding {{cvt|37|°C|°F|0}} on several days. The year 2014 was one of the wettest on record for the city. A total of {{cvt|914|mm|0}} fell up to the end of December, with {{cvt|220|mm|0}} recorded in this month alone. In 2015, Pretoria saw its worst drought since 1982; the month of November 2015 saw new records broken for high temperatures, with {{cvt|43|°C|°F|0}} recorded on 11 November after three weeks of temperatures between {{cvt|35|°C|°F|0}} and {{cvt|43|°C|°F|0}}. Pretoria reached a new record high of {{cvt|42.7|C}} on 7 January 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.weathersa.co.za/Documents/Corporate/Regional%20Weather%20and%20Climate_Gauteng_16042021150251.pdf |title=South African Weather Service - Regional Weather and Climate of South Africa: Gauteng |access-date=20 January 2022 |archive-date=22 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220122002436/https://www.weathersa.co.za/Documents/Corporate/Regional%20Weather%20and%20Climate_Gauteng_16042021150251.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref>

Depending on the extent of the area understood to constitute "Pretoria", the population ranges from 700,000<ref>Population, according to the 2001 Census, of the [http://census.adrianfrith.com/place/77612 Pretoria "main place"] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028104024/http://census.adrianfrith.com/place/77612 |date=28 October 2013 }}.</ref> to 2.95&nbsp;million.<ref>Population, according to the [http://www.statssa.gov.za/Publications/P03011/P030112007.pdf 2007 Community Survey] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825124835/http://www.statssa.gov.za/Publications/P03011/P030112007.pdf |date=25 August 2013 }}, of the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality after the 2011 annexation of the Metsweding District Municipality.</ref> The main languages spoken in Pretoria are [[Pedi language|Sepedi]], [[Setswana language|Setswana]], [[Tsonga language|Xitsonga]], [[Venda language|Tshivenda]], [[Afrikaans]] and English. The city of Pretoria has the largest white population in Sub-Saharan Africa. Since its founding, it has been a major [[Afrikaner]] population centre, and there are roughly 1&nbsp;million Afrikaners living in or around the city.

===Ethnic groups===
Even since the end of Apartheid, Pretoria itself has had a white majority, albeit with an ever-increasing black middle-class. However, in the townships of [[Mamelodi]], [[Soshanguve]] and [[Atteridgeville]] black people make up close to all of the population. The largest white ethnic group are the [[Afrikaners]] and the largest black ethnic group are the [[Northern Sotho people|Northern Sotho]]s.

The lower estimate for the population of Pretoria includes largely former white-designated areas, and there is therefore a white majority. However, including the geographically separate townships increases Pretoria's population beyond a million and makes whites a minority.

Pretoria's [[Indian South Africans|Indians]] were ordered to move from Pretoria to [[Laudium]] on 6 June 1958.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/transfer-indian-community-pretoria-laudium-ordered |title=Transfer of the Indian community of Pretoria to Laudium ordered. |last=tinashe |date=1 June 2012 |access-date=18 September 2014 |archive-date=2 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402132136/http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/transfer-indian-community-pretoria-laudium-ordered |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Cityscape==
Pretoria is known as the "Jacaranda City" due to the approximately 50,000 [[Jacaranda]]s that line its streets. Purple is a colour often associated with the city and is often included on local council logos and services such as the [[A Re Yeng]] rapid bus system and the logo of the local [[Jacaranda FM]] radio station.

===Central business district===
[[File:Prétoria-skyline.jpg|thumb|The Central Business District]]

Despite the many corporate offices, small businesses, shops, and government departments that are situated in [[List of Pretoria suburbs|Pretoria's sprawling suburbs]], its Central Business District still retains its status as the traditional centre of government and commerce. Many banks, businesses, large corporations, shops, shopping centres, and other businesses are situated in the city centre which is towered by several large skyscrapers, the tallest of which is the Poyntons Building ({{cvt|110|m|ft|disp=or}} tall), the ABSA Building ({{cvt|132|m|ft|disp=or}} tall) and the [[Reserve Bank of South Africa]] building ({{cvt|150|m|ft|disp=or}} tall).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/building/southafricanreservebankbuilding-pretoria-southafrica |title=South African Reserve Bank Building, Pretoria &#124; Building 103551 |location=Pretoria / |publisher=Emporis |access-date=19 April 2014 |archive-date=17 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417075012/http://www.emporis.com/building/southafricanreservebankbuilding-pretoria-southafrica |url-status=usurped}}</ref>

The area contains a large number of historical buildings, monuments, and museums that include the [[Pretoria City Hall]],  [[National Library of South Africa]], Pretorius Square, [[Church Square, Pretoria|Church Square]] (along with its many historical buildings and statues), and the [[Ou Raadsaal]]. There is also the [[Transvaal Museum]] (the country's leading natural history museum, which although it has changed venues a number of times, has been around since 1892), the [[National Zoological Gardens of South Africa]] (or more colloquially known as the Pretoria Zoo), [[Melrose House]] Museum in Jacob Maré Street, the [[Pretoria Art Museum]] and the [[African Window]] Cultural History Museum.

Several National Departments also have Head Offices in the Central Business district such as the Department of Health, Basic Education, Transport, Higher Education and Training, Sport and Recreation, Justice and Constitutional Development, Public Service and Administration, Water and Environmental Affairs and the National Treasury. The district also has a high number of residential buildings which house people who primarily work in the district.

====Jacaranda city====
[[File:Jacaranda Trees Pretoria.jpg|thumb|A street lined with [[Jacaranda mimosifolia|jacarandas]] in Pretoria, with the [[Union Buildings]] atop [[Meintjieskop]] in the background]]

{{One source|section|date=November 2019}}
Pretoria's nickname "the Jacaranda City" comes from the around 70,000 jacaranda trees that grow in Pretoria and decorate the city each October with their purple blossoms. The first two trees were planted in 1888 in the garden of local gardener, [[J.D. Cilliers]], at Myrtle Lodge on Celliers Street in [[Sunnyside, Pretoria|Sunnyside]]. He obtained the seedlings from a Cape Town nurseryman who had harvested them in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. The two trees still stand on the grounds of the Sunnyside Primary School.

The jacaranda comes from tropical South America and belongs to the family [[Bignoniaceae]]. There are around fifty species of jacaranda, but the one found most often in the warmer areas of [[Southern Africa]] is [[Jacaranda mimosifolia]].

At the end of the 19th century, the flower and tree grower James Clark imported jacaranda seedlings from Australia and began growing them on a large scale. In November 1906, he donated two hundred small saplings to the Pretoria City Council, which planted them on Koch Street (today Bosman Street). The city engineer Walton Jameson, soon known as "Jacaranda Jim", launched a program to plant jacaranda trees throughout Pretoria, and by 1971 there would already be 55,000 of them in the city.

Most jacarandas in Pretoria are lilac in colour, but there are also white ones planted on Herbert Baker Street in [[Groenkloof]].

The Jacaranda Carnival is an old tradition that was held from 1939 to 1964. After a hiatus of over twenty years, it resumed in 1985. Festivities include a colourful march and the crowning of the Jacaranda Queen.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boshoff |first1=Dawie |title=Jakarandastad vier fees |journal=Suid-Afrikaanse Panorama |date=March–April 1990 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=73–75}}</ref>

The [[R101 road (South Africa)|R101]] is the original N1, and served the same function before the construction of the highway. It runs through the centre of the city on regular streets rather than the eastern suburbs.<ref name=":0" />

The [[N4 road (South Africa)|N4]] enters the city as a highway from [[Witbank|eMalahleni]] in the east, merging with the N1 at the Proefplaas Interchange. It begins again north of the city, branching west from the N1 as the [[Platinum Highway]], forming the [[Pretoria Bypass|Northern Bypass]], and heading to [[Rustenburg]].<ref name=":0" /> The N4 runs east–west through South Africa, connecting [[Maputo]] to [[Gaborone]].<ref>[https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9781315062204-26/maputo-corridor-trans-kalahari-highway-guy-arnold The Maputo Corridor and the Trans-Kalahari Highway]</ref> The N4 is a toll road. Before the Platinum Highway was built, the N4 continued passed the Proefplaas Interchange to the city centre, where it became a regular road, before again becoming a partially-tolled highway west of the city towards [[Hartbeespoort]].

===Music===
<!-- [[Marching to Pretoria]] redirects here -->
A number of popular South African bands and musicians are originally from Pretoria. These include Desmond and the Tutus, Bittereinder, The Black Cat Bones, [[Seether]], popular mostwako rapper [[JR (rapper)|JR]], Joshua na die Reën and [[DJ Mujava]] who was raised in the town of Attridgeville.

The song "Marching to Pretoria" refers to this city. Pretoria was the capital of the [[South African Republic]] (a.k.a. Republic of the Transvaal; 1852–1881 and 1884–1902) the principal battleground for the [[First Boer War|First]] and [[Second Boer War]], the latter which brought both the Transvaal and the Orange Free State republic under British rule. "Marching to Pretoria" was one of the songs that British soldiers sang as they marched from the [[Cape Colony]], under British Rule since 1814, to the capital of the Southern African Republic (or in Dutch, ''Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek''). As the song's refrain puts it: "We are marching to Pretoria, Pretoria, Pretoria/We are marching to Pretoria, Pretoria, Hurrah."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.traditionalmusic.co.uk/folk-songs-with-chords/Marching%20To%20Pretoria.htm |title=Traditional & Folk Songs with Chords: Marching To Pretoria |publisher=Traditionalmusic.co.uk |access-date=19 April 2014 |archive-date=20 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420041556/http://www.traditionalmusic.co.uk/folk-songs-with-chords/Marching%20To%20Pretoria.htm |url-status=live}}</ref>

The opening line of [[John Lennon]]'s [[Beatles]]' song [[I Am the Walrus]], "I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together", is often believed to be based on the lyric "I'm with you and you're with me and so we are all together"<ref>traditionalmusic.co.uk, ''op. cit.''</ref> in "Marching to Pretoria". Lennon denied this, insisting his lyrics came from "nothing".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shmoop.com/i-am-the-walrus/lyrics.html |title="'I Am the Walrus' Lyrics," Shmoop: We Speak Student |publisher=Shmoop.com |access-date=19 April 2014 |archive-date=20 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420094300/http://www.shmoop.com/i-am-the-walrus/lyrics.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Loftus Versfeld Stadium|Loftus Versfeld]] is home to the [[Blue Bulls]], who compete in the domestic [[Currie Cup]], and also to the [[Bulls (rugby)|Bulls]] in the international [[United Rugby Championship]] competition. The Bulls rugby team, which is operated by the Blue Bulls, won the Super Rugby competition in [[2007 Super 14 season|2007]], [[2009 Super 14 season|2009]] and [[2010 Super 14 season|2010]]. Loftus Versfeld also hosts the [[Association football|football]] side [[Mamelodi Sundowns]].

Pretoria also hosted matches during the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]]. Loftus Versfeld was used for some matches in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].

[[Association football]] is one of the most popular sports in the city. There are two football teams in the city playing in South Africa's top-flight football league, the [[South African Premier Division|Premier Soccer League]]. They are [[Mamelodi Sundowns]] and [[Supersport United]]. Supersport United were the [[2008–09 Premier Soccer League|2008–09 PSL Champions]]. Following the 2011/2012 season the [[University of Pretoria F.C.]] gained promotion to the [[South African Premier Division]], the top domestic league, becoming the third Pretoria-based team in the league.<ref>{{cite web |author=Premier Soccer League |url=http://www.supersport.com/football/national-first-division/news/120513/Tuks_secures_Premiership_promotion |title=Tuks secure Premiership promotion – SuperSport – Football |publisher=SuperSport |date=13 May 2012 |access-date=16 November 2012 |archive-date=7 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200307091843/https://supersport.com/football/national-first-division/news/120513/Tuks_secures_Premiership_promotion |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/sport/2012/05/10/amatuks-make-it-to-top-flight |title=AmaTuks make it to top flight |publisher=Sowetan LIVE |date=10 May 2012 |access-date=16 November 2012 |archive-date=2 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702021117/http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/sport/2012/05/10/amatuks-make-it-to-top-flight |url-status=live}}</ref> After a poor league finish in the 2015/2016 season, University of Pretoria F.C. were relegated to the [[National First Division]], the second-highest football league in South Africa, in the 2016 [[Premier Soccer League]] promotion/relegation play-offs.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.goal.com/en-za/news/4667/sa-psl/2016/06/22/24879682/university-of-pretoria-highlands-park-preview-relegated |title=University of Pretoria – Highlands Park Preview: Relegated AmaTuks eye consolation win {{!}} Goal.com |website=www.goal.com |access-date=28 October 2019 |archive-date=28 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191028170525/https://www.goal.com/en-za/news/4667/sa-psl/2016/06/22/24879682/university-of-pretoria-highlands-park-preview-relegated |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Cricket]] is also a popular game in the city. As there is no international cricket stadium in the city, it does not host any top-class cricket tournaments, although the nearby situated [[Centurion, Gauteng|Centurion]] has [[Supersport Park]] which is an international cricket stadium and has hosted many important tournaments such as [[2003 Cricket World Cup]], [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]], [[2009 IPL]] and [[2009 ICC Champions Trophy]]. The most local franchise team to Pretoria is the [[Titans cricket team|Titans]], although [[Northerns cricket team|Northerns]] occasionally play in the city in South Africa's provincial competitions. Many Pretoria born cricketers have gone on to play for [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]], including former international captains [[AB de Villiers]] [[Faf du Plessis]].

The Pretoria Transnet Blind Cricket Club is situated in Pretoria and is the biggest Blind Cricket club in South Africa. Their field is at the Transnet Engineering campus on Lynette Street, home of differently disabled cricket. PTBCC has played many successful blind cricket matches with abled bodied teams such as the South African Indoor Cricket Team and TuksCricket Junior Academy. Northerns Blind Cricket is the Provincial body that governs PTBCC and Filefelfia Secondary School. The Northern Blind Cricket team won the 40 over National Blind Cricket tournament that was held in Cape Town in April 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ptbcc.com |title=魁斗财经 |website=www.ptbcc.com |access-date=29 May 2021 |archive-date=6 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180806030159/http://ptbcc.com/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Jewish community===

{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2019}}
Pretoria has a small Jewish community of around 3,000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Support Association for Zionism – South African Jewry: History of Pretoria Jewry |url=http://www.sazionism.co.za/history-of-pretoria-jewry.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721043724/http://www.sazionism.co.za/history-of-pretoria-jewry.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 July 2015 |access-date=16 November 2019}}</ref> Jewish citizens have been in Pretoria since its foundation in the 19th century and played an important role in its industrial and economic growth. A Mr. De Vries, the first Jewish inhabitant of Pretoria, was a prominent citizen and prosecutor, a member of the [[Volksraad of the South African Republic|Volksraad]] and a pioneer of the [[Afrikaans language]]. Another famed Jewish Pretorian was [[Sammy Marks]].

Other early Jewish settlers, many of them immigrants from [[Lithuania]], were not as educated as De Vries and often did not speak Dutch, Afrikaans, or English. Many of them spoke only [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and made a living as shopkeepers in the local retail industry. Most Jewish residents stayed neutral in the [[Second Boer War]], though some joined the [[South African Republic]] army.

The first congregation was founded between 1890 and 1895, and in 1898 the first synagogue, [[The Old Synagogue, Pretoria|The Old Synagogue]] opened on Paul Kruger Street.<ref name=up>[https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/49734/Clarke_Chapter7_2015.pdf?sequence=24&isAllowed=y Church Square, the Old Synagogue and the Old Government Printing Work, Three historic places for testing strategic intervention] University of Pretoria. 2015</ref> A second synagogue, known as the Great Synagogue, opened in 1922. Both synagogues are no longer in operation, but a [[Reformed Judaism|Reformed]] synagogue, Temple Menorah, opened in the early 1950s.

The Jewish community of Pretoria's golden age was in the early 20th century, when many Jewish sports clubs, charities, and youth groups flourished. After 1948, many Jews left for Cape Town or Johannesburg.

The Old Synagogue on Paul Kruger Street was purchased by the government in 1952 to become the new home of the High Court where prominent opposition figures in the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] were tried, including [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Walter Sisulu]], and 26 others were prosecuted for treason from 1 August 1958 to 29 March 1961; the [[Rivonia Trial]] was held there in 1963–1964.<ref name=up/>

Two Jewish schools arose in Pretoria, the Miriam Marks School, which was founded in 1905, and the Carmel School, which opened in 1959. Only the second, currently also operating as a synagogue, remains. Pretoria's Reformed congregation shares a rabbi with the Johannesburg one, though the synagogue no longer operates and services take place in worshippers' private homes.

===Buddhist community===
A [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] center, the Jang Chup Chopel Rigme Centre ("Center of Light") was founded in early January 2015 by Duan Pienaar or Gyalten Nyima (his adopted monastic name) in [[Waverley, Pretoria|Waverley]] around Pretoria-Moot. Pienaar is the only Afrikaner ordained in the highly selective [[Tibet]]an [[Vajrayana|Tantric Buddhist]] community in [[Bylakuppe]], in southern India. His instructor [[Lama]] [[Kyabje Choden Rinpoche]] is the highest tantric master after the [[Dalai Lama]]. Pienaar, who studied Buddhist teachers for twenty years, spent two years in India.<ref>{{cite journal |title=En daar verrys toe 'n Boeddhiste-sentrum |journal=Pretoria Moot Rekord |date=24 April 2015 |page=5}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Van Zyl |first1=Seugnet |title=Boere-Boeddhis begin sentrum in Pretoria |url=https://www.netwerk24.com/Nuus/Boere-Boeddhis-begin-sentrum-in-Pretoria-20150415 |access-date=16 November 2019 |work=Netwerk24 |date=15 April 2015 |archive-date=30 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730210901/https://www.netwerk24.com/Nuus/Boere-Boeddhis-begin-sentrum-in-Pretoria-20150415 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Coat of arms===
[[File:Coat of arms of Pretoria.svg|thumb|Pretoria civic coat of arms (1907)]]
The Pretoria civic arms, designed by Frans Engelenburg,<ref name=pre>Bodel, J.D.;  'The Coat of Arms and Other Heraldic Symbols of the City of Pretoria' in ''Pretoriana'' (November 1989).</ref> were granted by the [[College of Arms]] on 7 February 1907. They were registered with the Transvaal Provincial Administration in March 1953<ref name=og>Transvaal ''Official Gazette'' 2372 (11 March 1953).</ref> and at the [[Bureau of Heraldry]] in May 1968.<ref name=boh>http://www.national.archsrch.gov.za{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The Bureau provided new artwork, in a more modern style, in 1989.<ref name=tor>'Nuwe Standswapen' in ''Toria'' (July 1989).</ref>

The arms were: ''Gules, on an mimosa tree eradicated proper within an orle of eight bees volant, Or, an inescutcheon Or and thereon a Roman praetor seated proper''. In layman's terms: a red shield displaying an uprooted mimosa tree surrounded by a border of eight golden bees, superimposed on the tree is a golden shield depicting a Roman praetor. The tree represented growth, the bees industry, and the praetor (judge) was an heraldic pun on the name.

The crest was a three-towered golden castle; the supporters were an eland and a kudu; and the motto ''Praestantia praevaleat Pretoria''.
The coat of arms have gone out of favour after the City Council amalgamated with its surrounding councils to form the [[City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality]].

The [[University of South Africa]] (commonly referred to as Unisa), founded in 1873 as the [[University of the Cape of Good Hope]], is the largest university on the African continent and attracts a third of all higher education students in South Africa. It spent most of its early history as an examining agency for Oxford and Cambridge universities and as an incubator from which most other universities in South Africa are descended. In 1946 it was given a new role as a distance education university and in 2012 it had a student headcount of over 300,000 students, including African and international students in 130 countries worldwide, making it one of the world's mega universities.

Although the name change was approved by the SAGNC, it was not approved by the Minister of Arts and Culture, who at the time requested further research on the matter. Should the Minister approve the name change, the name will be published in the Government Gazette, giving the public opportunity to comment on the matter. The Minister can then refer that public response back to the SAGNC before presenting a recommendation before parliament for a vote. Various public interest groups warned that any name change would be challenged in court, should the minister approve it. The long process involved makes a name change less likely.

The Tshwane Metro Council has advertised "Africa's leading capital city" as ''Tshwane'' since the SAGNC decision in 2005. This has led to further controversy, however, as the name of the city had not yet been changed, and the council was, at best, acting prematurely. When a complaint was lodged with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), it ruled that such advertisements are deliberately misleading and should be withdrawn from all media.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,9294,2-7-12_2097251,00.html |title=SABC pulls 'Tshwane city' ads |publisher=News24.com |date=11 April 2007 |access-date=3 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309023142/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0%2C9294%2C2-7-12_2097251%2C00.html |archive-date=9 March 2009}}</ref> Despite the rulings of the ASA, Tshwane Metro Council failed to discontinue their "City of Tshwane" advertisements. As a result, the ASA requested that Tshwane Metro pay for advertisements in which it admits that it has misled the public. After refusing to abide by the ASA's request, the Metro Council was banned from placing any advertisements in the South African media that refer to the capital as Tshwane. ASA may still place additional sanctions on the Metro Council that would prevent it from placing any advertisements in the South African media, including council notices and employment vacancies.<ref>{{cite web |author=Independent Online |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=594&art_id=vn20070423045707464C538603 |title=SA capital advert row sparks ad-alert threat, IOL |publisher=Iol.co.za |access-date=3 July 2010 |archive-date=18 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218213345/http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=594&art_id=vn20070423045707464C538603 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fin24.co.za/articles/business/display_article.aspx?Nav=ns&lvl2=buss&ArticleID=1518-1786_2103974 |title=Media can't place Tshwane ads, FIN24 |publisher=Fin24.co.za |access-date=3 July 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

After the ruling, the Metro Council continued to place ''Tshwane'' advertisements, but placed them on council-owned advertising boards and busstops throughout the municipal area. In August 2007, an internal memo was leaked to the media in which the Tshwane mayor sought advice from the premier of Gauteng on whether the municipality could be called the "City of Tshwane" instead of just "Tshwane".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,,2-7-12_2158167,00.html |title=Down with Pretoria signs!: South Africa: Politics |publisher=News24 |date=2 August 2007 |access-date=3 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309023138/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0%2C%2C2-7-12_2158167%2C00.html |archive-date=9 March 2009}}</ref> This could increase confusion about the distinction between the city of Pretoria and the municipality of Tshwane.

In early 2010 it was again rumoured that the South African government would make a decision regarding the name; however, a media briefing regarding name changes, which could have been an opportunity to discuss it, was cancelled shortly before taking place.<ref>{{cite web |author=Wilson Johwa |url=http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=92376 |title=Mashatile postpones name changes after 'technicality'. |publisher=Businessday.co.za |access-date=3 July 2010 |archive-date=23 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723234219/http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=92376 |url-status=live}}</ref> Rumours of the name change provoked outrage from Afrikaner civil rights and political groups.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/news/local/article287159.ece |title=AfriForum to fight for Pretoria name. |publisher=Timeslive.co.za |access-date=3 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203184916/http://www.timeslive.co.za/news/local/article287159.ece |archive-date=3 February 2010}}</ref> It later emerged that the registration of the municipality as a geographic place had been published in the [[government gazette]] as it had been too late to withdraw the name from the publication,<ref>{{cite web |author=Independent Online |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=vn20100203042043944C666729 |title=Pretoria name change rethink |publisher=Iol.co.za |access-date=3 July 2010}}</ref> but it was announced that the name had been withdrawn, pending "further work" by officials.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jacarandafm.com/kagiso/content/en/jacaranda/jacaranda-news?oid=548186&sn=Detail&pid=6182&Pretoria-Tshwane-delayed |title=Pretoria/Tshwane delayed. |publisher=Jacarandafm.com |date=2 February 2010 |access-date=3 July 2010 |archive-date=13 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713072502/http://www.jacarandafm.com/kagiso/content/en/jacaranda/jacaranda-news?oid=548186&sn=Detail&pid=6182&Pretoria-Tshwane-delayed |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71654?oid=158607&sn=Detail |title=Xingwana retracts Pretoria name change. |publisher=Politicsweb.co.za |access-date=3 July 2010 |archive-date=22 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722081211/http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71654?oid=158607&sn=Detail |url-status=live}}</ref> The following week, the registration of "Tshwane" was officially withdrawn in the Government Gazette.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.iafrica.com/sa/2208061.htm |title=It's officially Pretoria. iafrica.com |publisher=News.iafrica.com |access-date=3 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209002319/http://news.iafrica.com/sa/2208061.htm |archive-date=9 February 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jacarandafm.com/kagiso/content/en/jacaranda/jacaranda-news?oid=550881&sn=Detail&pid=6182&Pretoria-is-Pretoria-again---for-now |title=Pretoria is Pretoria again – for now. |publisher=Jacarandafm.com |access-date=3 July 2010 |archive-date=13 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713072549/http://www.jacarandafm.com/kagiso/content/en/jacaranda/jacaranda-news?oid=550881&sn=Detail&pid=6182&Pretoria-is-Pretoria-again---for-now |url-status=live}}</ref> The retraction had reportedly been ordered at the behest of the [[Deputy President of South Africa]] [[Kgalema Motlanthe]], acting on behalf of President Jacob Zuma, as minister of Arts and Culture [[Lulu Xingwana]] had acted contrary to the position of the ANC, which is that Pretoria and the municipality are separate entities, which was subsequently articulated by ANC secretary general [[Gwede Mantashe]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leadershiponline.co.za/articles/politics/487-government-policy |title=Government policy.'Leadership' |publisher=Leadershiponline.co.za |date=23 March 2010 |access-date=3 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611151631/http://www.leadershiponline.co.za/articles/politics/487-government-policy |archive-date=11 June 2010}}</ref>

In March 2010 a group supporting the name change, calling themselves the "Tshwane Royal House Committee", claimed to be descendants of Chief Tshwane and demanded to be made part of the administration of the municipality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/article354858.ece |title=Tshwane Royals: 'Change Pretoria for benefit of all'. |publisher=Timeslive.co.za |access-date=3 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317140308/http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/article354858.ece |archive-date=17 March 2010}}</ref>

According to comments made by Mayor [[Kgosientso Ramokgopa]] in late 2011, the change would occur in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Pretoria-will-become-Tshwane-mayor-20111122 |title=Pretoria will become Tshwane – mayor |publisher=News24 |date=22 November 2011 |access-date=16 November 2012 |archive-date=13 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513150833/http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Pretoria-will-become-Tshwane-mayor-20111122 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/old-cities-new-names |title=Old cities, new names &#124; Radio Netherlands Worldwide |publisher=Rnw.nl |access-date=16 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118070506/http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/old-cities-new-names |archive-date=18 January 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> However, there remained considerable uncertainty about the issue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beeld.com/Suid-Afrika/Nuus/Pretoria-of-Tshwane-Minister-weet-self-nie-20120127 |title=Pretoria of Tshwane?
