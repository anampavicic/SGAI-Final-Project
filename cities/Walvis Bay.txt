The bay is a safe haven for sea vessels because of its natural deep-water harbour, protected by the Pelican Point [[sand spit]], being the only natural harbour of any size along the country's coast. Being rich in [[plankton]] and [[marine life]], these waters also draw large numbers of [[southern right whale]]s,<ref>[http://www.namibiandolphinproject.com/animals/species-profiles/southern-right-whale/ Southern Right Whale, Eubalaena australis], The Namibian Dolphin Project</ref> attracting whalers and fishing vessels.

A succession of colonists developed the location and resources of this strategic harbour settlement. The harbour's value in relation to the sea route around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] had caught the attention of world powers since it was discovered by the outside world in 1485. The importance of the harbour, combined with its extreme isolation by land, explains the complicated political history of the town. For much of its history, Walvis Bay was governed as an [[exclave]] separate from the rest of the territory that today is Namibia.

The town is situated just north of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] in the [[Kuiseb River]] delta and lies at the end of the [[TransNamib|TransNamib Railway]] to [[Windhoek]], and on [[B2 road (Namibia)|B2 road]].

Walvis Bay, with its large bay and sand dunes, is an important centre of tourism activity in Namibia. Attractions include the artificial [[Bird Island (Namibia)|Bird Island]], centre of a [[guano]] collection industry, the [[Dune 7 (Namibia)|Dune 7]] sand dune, the salt works, the abundant birdlife, and a museum. [[Kuisebmund Stadium]], home to two clubs in the [[Namibia Premier League]], is also located in the city. The beach resort of [[Langstrand]] lies just a few kilometres north. The [[Walvis Bay Export Processing Zone]] is an important facet of the local economy.

== Etymology ==
The Dutch referred to it as {{lang|nl|Walvisch Baye}} and the English as ''Whale Bay''. In its eventual formal incorporation, it was named ''Walfish Bay'', which was changed to ''Walvish Bay'', and ultimately to ''Walvis Bay''. It has also been referred to as ''Walwich Bay''<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=vcwNAAAAQAAJ&q=walwich&pg=PR1 ''Narrative of a voyage to the South Seas''] Charles Medyett Goodridge, Hamilton and Adams, 1832, page 16</ref> or ''Walwisch Bay''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9wXAAAAYAAJ&q=+Walwisch&pg=PA337 ''The World of Waters or A Peaceful Progress o'er the Unpathed Sea''], Fanny Osborne, R.

[[File:Walvis Bay map.jpeg|thumb|Map showing location of Walvis Bay and reference to South Africa before the handover to [[Namibia]]]]

Walvis Bay was founded at the end of the 18th century as a stopover for sea travel between [[Cape Town]] and the [[Netherlands]] by the Dutch East India Company.<ref name=Mbathera>{{cite news | title=Colonial sewerage system on the verge of collapse | first=Esther | last=Mbathera | newspaper=[[The Namibian]] | date=2 March 2021 | page=5 | url=https://www.namibian.com.na/99471/read/Colonial-sewerage-system-on-the-verge-of-collapse | access-date=2 March 2021 | archive-date=2 March 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210302124514/https://www.namibian.com.na/99471/read/Colonial-sewerage-system-on-the-verge-of-collapse | url-status=dead }}</ref> No permanent (year round) settlement was attempted and little commercial development occurred on the site until the late 19th century. In the meantime, the Cape Colony had become British, and during the [[Scramble for Africa]], the [[British Empire|British]] claimed Walvis Bay. They permitted the [[Cape Colony]] to complete the annexation of the territory in 1884, together with the [[Penguin Islands]], following initial steps which had been taken in 1878.<ref>Britannica,

In 1910, Walvis Bay, as part of the [[Cape Colony]], became part of the newly formed [[Union of South Africa]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=C49CAQAAIAAJ&q=%22and+with+it%22 Debates of Parliament], ''Hansard'', Volume 9, Issues 19-21, Government Printer, 1993, page 10179</ref> Subsequently, a dispute arose with Germany over the [[exclave]]'s boundaries, which was eventually settled in 1911, with Walvis Bay being allocated an area of {{convert|434|sqmi|0|order=flip}}.<ref name="geography">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/40572467.pdf Walvis Bay: exclave no more], Ieuan Griffiths, ''Geography'', Vol. 79, No. 4 (October 1994), page 354</ref>

The exclave was overrun by the Germans during the [[South West Africa Campaign]] early in the [[First World War]], but the [[Union Defence Force (South Africa)|Union Defence Force]] (UDF) of South Africa eventually ousted the Germans in 1915.<ref>{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjZHLXRKjtEC&q=%22Walvis+Bay%22&pg=PA119 |first=David  |last=Killingray |chapter=Chapter 8.

South Africa was later awarded control (a [[League of Nations mandate#Class C mandates|Class "C" mandate]]) over [[South West Africa]] by the [[League of Nations]] to administer the territory.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9LLZBAAAQBAJ&dq=Walvis+Bay+was+transferred+to+South-West+Africa+by+an+act+of+the+South+African+parliament+in+1922&pg=PA67 ''The Namibian War of Independence, 1966-1989: Diplomatic, Economic and Military Campaigns''], Richard Dale McFarland, 2014, page 67</ref> Civilian rule was restored in South West Africa in 1921 and administration of Walvis Bay was transferred to South West Africa under the [[South West Africa Affairs Act of 1922]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=kKQvAQAAIAAJ&q=%22Civilian+rule%22+ ''Strategic territory and territorial strategy: the geopolitics of Walvis Bay's reintegration into Namibia''], David Simon, Namibian Economic Policy Research Unit, 1995, page 8</ref>

Despite the territory never having been part of [[German South West Africa]], the Act stated that: "the port and settlement of Walvis Bay, which forms part of the Cape of Good Hope, shall for judicial and administrative purposes be regarded as if it were part of the mandated territory of South West Africa".<ref name="geography" /> However, South Africa had also sought to annex South West Africa itself, and had presented such a proposal to the League of Nations.<ref name="receuil" /> Consequently, in 1949, the Act was amended to give representation in the [[Parliament of South Africa]] to whites in South West Africa.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=MaU7AQAAMAAJ&q=%22Union+House+of+Assembly%22 ''Official Documents of the 4th Session of the United Nations General Assembly''], United Nations, 1949, page 11</ref>

On 14 December 1971 the [[1971–72 Namibian contract workers strike|Namibian general contract workers]] strike began in Walvis Bay, after starting the day before in [[Windhoek]]. The goal of the strike was the abolition of the contract labour system, to oppose [[apartheid]], and promote Namibia's independence.<ref name="general">{{Cite journal |last=Rogers |first=Barbara |date=1972 |title=Namibia's General Strike |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4185227 |journal=Africa Today |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=3–8 |issn=0001-9887 |jstor=4185227}}</ref>

In 1977, following increasing international pressure to relinquish its control over South West Africa, South Africa repealed the Act, but transferred control of Walvis Bay back to the [[Cape Province]], thereby making it an [[exclave]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=tj8vAAAAYAAJ&q=Walvis+Bay++ ''The Green and the dry wood: The Roman Catholic Church (Vicariate of Windhoek) and the Namibian socio-political situation, 1971-1981''], Oblates of Mary Immaculate, 1983, page 6</ref> From 1980, it was represented in both the [[Cape Provincial Council|Provincial Council]] and the [[House of Assembly of South Africa|House of Assembly]] as part of the [[Green Point, Cape Town|Green Point]] constituency in [[Cape Town]], before becoming a separate constituency in 1982.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lApBAQAAIAAJ&q=%22Walvis+Bay%22+Green+Point ''Sub-Saharan Africa Report'', Issues 2578-2584], Foreign Broadcast Information Service., 1982, page 48</ref>

In response, the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 432|Resolution 432 (1978)]], which declared that "the territorial integrity and unity of Namibia must be assured through the reintegration of Walvis Bay within its territory".<ref>{{cite web|title=Resolution 432 (1978) of 27 July 1978|url=http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/68837/S_RES_432%281978%29-EN.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|access-date=3 April 2018|website=un.org|archive-date=23 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223162037/http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/68837/S_RES_432%281978%29-EN.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1990, South West Africa gained independence as [[Namibia]], but Walvis Bay remained under South African sovereignty, with South Africa increasing the number of troops.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160223143423/http://articles.philly.com/1990-01-14/news/25910185_1_swapo-president-sam-nujoma-namibia-daniel-tjongarero Namibia Nears Freedom, But S.

== Geography ==

=== Suburbs ===
Due to its South African administration Walvis Bay was developed as a [[Racial segregation|segregated]] town. The suburb of [[Kuisebmond]], located 3.2 kilometres (1.8 mi) from Walvis Bay city centre,<ref>{{cite web |title=Route from Walvis Bay to Kuisebmond |url=https://namibia.places-in-the-world.com/3359638-3364933-route-from-walvis-bay-to-kuisebmond.html |publisher=Places in the world}}</ref> housed Black people; [[Narraville]], located 3.3 kilometres (2 mi) from Walvis Bay city centre,<ref>{{cite web |title=Route from Walvis Bay to Narraville |url=https://namibia.places-in-the-world.com/3359638-3363754-route-from-walvis-bay-to-narraville.html |publisher=Places in the world}}</ref> was inhabited by [[Coloureds]]; and [[White people in Namibia|Whites]] lived in the city centre.<ref name=Mbathera/>

After the incorporation of the town into Namibia, many people have settled in shacks around it. In an effort to reduce the impact of the [[Informal housing|informal settlements]], the municipality formed the [[Tutaleni Housing Project]] to the northeast.{{fact|date=August 2024}}

=== Climate ===
Despite its location within the [[tropics]], Walvis Bay features the very rare mild variation of the [[cold desert climate]] (''BWk'') according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]. It is caused by the rain shadow of the [[Naukluft Mountains]] and the cooling effect of the coastal sea temperature by the [[Benguela Current]]. Walvis Bay receives only {{convert|13.2|mm}} average precipitation per year, making it one of the driest cities on earth. Despite its dry climate, the city is relatively humid. Average relative humidity throughout the year remains above 80%. The warmest month is February with average temperature {{convert|17.9|C}}, while the coolest months are August and September with average temperature {{convert|13.2|C}}. The diurnal temperature range is also low, averaging only {{convert|5.7|C-change|F-change}}.

A weather station operated on the Pelican Point headland from 1958 to 1984. Unusually, the highest temperatures are not recorded during the summer; autumn, spring, and even winter have all seen higher temperatures than the hottest days in summer. These record highs occur when offshore winds blow downwards from the high plateau inland and are nonetheless mild by comparison to many other cities in the tropics at the same latitude. Higher temperatures have been recorded, even just slightly inland, such as a report of {{convert|42.8|C}} at the airport on 15 April 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/extraordinary-heat-wave-sweeps-southeast-asia-and-points-beyond.html|title = Extraordinary Heat Wave Sweeps Southeast Asia and Points Beyond &#124; Weather Extremes}}</ref>

=== Fishing ===
[[File:Oyster farming, Walvis Bay (Namibia).jpg|thumb|[[Oyster]]s are cultivated for export at Walvis Bay]]In Walvis Bay there are a variety of fishing companies like Hangana Seafood, Caroline Fishing, Benguella Fishing Company, Cadilu Fishing, Etosha Fisheries, Kuiseb Fishing Enterprises, Blue Ocean Products, Benguella Sea Products, Consortium Fisheries, Talanam Fish Processor. These companies catch diverse types of fish, like [[Thyrsites|snoek]], [[horse mackerel]], [[anchovy]], [[white steenbras]], kabeljou, [[kingklip]], [[hake]], [[catfish]], [[tuna]], and [[sardines]]. Hangana Seafood are processors and exporters of fish and fish products. As such, the fishing enterprise accounts for a major part of Walvis Bay's economy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}}

In May 2018, a spokesman for the National Fishing Corporation of Namibia (Fishcor), confirmed that a new N$530 million onshore processing plant would be operational by September 2018.

== Transport ==

[[File:Flughafen Walfish Bay Luftaufnahme.jpg|right|thumb|[[Walvis Bay Airport|Walvis Bay International Airport]]]]

Walvis Bay is an important logistical port for the southern African region, providing port facilities for the import and export of cargo for the rest of Namibia, Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Botswana. Since the Walvis Bay Corridor Group (WBCG) was established in 2000, cargo moving through the port has increased from 30,000 [[intermodal container|containers]] a year to 370,000 containers in 2016.  As of 2017 the port was being upgraded to increase its capacity to move 1 million containers a year by 2019.  Bureaucratic and logistical problems at the city's competitor port at [[Durban]], South Africa have diverted traffic to the port at Walvis Bay. Ninety-five percent of all cargo hauled overland through Walvis Bay is carried by truck.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/is-this-country-the-new-commercial-gateway-to-southern-africa/80696|title=Is This Country the New Commercial Gateway to Southern Africa?|last=Dall|first=Nick|work=OZY|date=6 September 2017|access-date=2017-09-06|language=en|archive-date=8 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808035717/https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/is-this-country-the-new-commercial-gateway-to-southern-africa/80696|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Walvis Bay Corridor Group is gearing up to increase import/export-business opportunities in Namibia. The Namibian National Development Plan expects to complete the expansion programme of the Walvis Bay port by 2019. Because of the harbour's geographical positioning, authorities plan to gain a footprint in providing landlocked Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries with a vital logistical hub.<ref name=Larkin/> In addition to the importance of the port, development would strengthen trade corridors which consists of current road and rail networks.<ref name=Larkin>{{cite news |title=Walvis Bay aims to become hub for SADC import/export |first=Philippa |last=Larkin |url= https://www.iol.co.za/business-report/companies/walvis-bay-aims-to-become-hub-for-sadc-importexport-8322681 |newspaper=Business Report |date=24 March 2017 |access-date=29 July 2018}}</ref>
