==Toponymy==
"Lucknow" is the [[Anglicisation of names|anglicised]] spelling of the local pronunciation "Lakhnau". According to one legend, the city is named after [[Lakshmana]], a hero of the Hindu epic ''[[Ramayana]]''. The legend states that Lakshmana had a palace or an estate in the area, which was called  ''Lakshmanapuri'' ([[Sanskrit]]: लक्ष्मणपुरी, lit. ''Lakshmana's city''). The settlement came to be known as Lakhanpur (or Lachhmanpur) by the 11th century, and later, Lucknow.<ref name="Veena2014">{{cite book |author=Veena Talwar Oldenburg |title=The Making of Colonial Lucknow, 1856–1877 |url={{GBurl|id=6tP_AwAAQBAJ|p=6}} |date=14 July 2014 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-1-4008-5630-5 |page=6 }}</ref><ref name="PNas1993">{{cite book |author=P.

A similar theory states that the city was known as ''Lakshmanavati'' ({{langx|sa| लक्ष्मणवती}}, fortunate) after Lakshmana. The name changed to ''Lakhanavati'', then Lakhnauti and finally Lakhnau.<ref name="Philip2006">{{cite book |author=Philip Lutgendorf Professor of Hindi and Modern Indian Studies University of Iowa |title=Hanuman's Tale : The Messages of a Divine Monkey: The Messages of a Divine Monkey |url={{GBurl|id=fVFC2Nx-LP8C|p=245}} |date=13 December 2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-804220-4 |page=245 }}</ref> Yet another theory states that the city's name is connected with [[Lakshmi]], the Hindu goddess of wealth.

==History==
{{See also|Awadh|Kosala|Oudh State}}

From 1350 onwards, Lucknow and parts of the Awadh region were ruled by the Delhi Sultanate, [[Jaunpur Sultanate|Sharqi Sultanate]], [[Mughal Empire]], [[Nawab of Awadh|Nawabs of Awadh]], the British [[East India Company]] and the [[British Raj]]. 

For about eighty-four years (from 1394 to 1478), Awadh was part of the Sharqi Sultanate of Jaunpur. Emperor [[Humayun]] made it a part of the Mughal Empire around 1555. Emperor [[Jahangir]] (1569–1627) granted an estate in Awadh to a favoured nobleman, Sheikh Abdul Rahim, who later built Machchi Bhawan on this estate. It later became the seat of power from where his descendants, the ''Sheikhzadas'', controlled the region.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://lucknow.me/history.html|title = Introduction to Lucknow|access-date = 24 August 2014|publisher = Lucknow|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140107223010/https://lucknow.me/history.html|archive-date = 7 January 2014|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

The [[Nawab of Awadh|Nawabs of Lucknow]] (actually the Nawabs of Awadh) acquired the name after the reign of the third Nawab when Lucknow became their capital. The city became North India's [[cultural capital]], and its nawabs, best remembered for their refined and extravagant lifestyles, were patrons of the arts.

Under their dominion, music and dance flourished, and construction of numerous monuments took place.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laxys.com/lucknow.html |title=Lucknow City |publisher=Laxys |access-date=29 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426071814/http://www.laxys.com/lucknow.html |archive-date=26 April 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Of the monuments standing today, the [[Bara Imambara]], the [[Chota Imambara]], and the [[Rumi Darwaza]] are notable examples. One of the Nawab's enduring legacies is the region's syncretic Hindu–Muslim culture that has come to be known as the ''[[Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/standpoint-understanding-ganga-jamuni-tehzeeb-how-diverse-is-the-indian-multiculturalism-1995684|title = Understanding Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb: How diverse is the "Indian multiculturalism"|date = 15 June 2014|access-date = 27 August 2014|website = DNA India|publisher = DNA Webdesk|last = Safvi|first = Rana|location = Mumbai|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140903135602/http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/standpoint-understanding-ganga-jamuni-tehzeeb-how-diverse-is-the-indian-multiculturalism-1995684|archive-date = 3 September 2014|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

Until 1719, the [[Subah (country subdivision)|''subah'']] of Awadh was a province of the Mughal Empire administered by a governor appointed by the emperor. Persian adventurer [[Saadat Ali Khan I|Saadat Khan]], also known as Burhan-ul-Mulk, was appointed [[Monarch|''Nizam'']] of Awadh in 1722 and established his court in [[Faizabad]], near Lucknow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/fa/FaizabdInd.html |title=Faizabad, Town, India |access-date=27 August 2014 |website=Bartleby |publisher=The Columbia Encyclopaedia |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602140017/http://www.bartleby.com/65/fa/FaizabdInd.html |archive-date=2 June 2009 }}</ref>

Many independent kingdoms, such as Awadh, were established as the Mughal Empire [[Historiography of the fall of the Mughal Empire|disintegrated]]. The third Nawab, [[Shuja-ud-Daula]] (r. 1753–1775), fell out with the British after aiding the fugitive [[Nawabs of Bengal and Murshidabad|Nawab of Bengal]], [[Mir Qasim]]. Roundly defeated at the [[Battle of Buxar]] by the [[East India Company]], he was forced to pay heavy penalties and surrender parts of his territory.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://lucknow.me/Shuja-ud-Daula.html|title = Shuja Ud Daula|access-date = 24 August 2014|website = Lucknow|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150917060606/http://lucknow.me/Shuja-ud-Daula.html|archive-date = 17 September 2015|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Awadh's capital, Lucknow rose to prominence when [[Asaf-ud-Daula]], the fourth Nawab, shifted his court to the city from Faizabad in 1775.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://lucknow.me/Asaf-ud-Daula.html|title = Asaf Ud Daula|access-date = 24 August 2014|website = Lucknow|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150911213226/http://lucknow.me/Asaf-ud-Daula.html|archive-date = 11 September 2015|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref> The British East India Company appointed a resident (ambassador) in 1773 and by early 19th century gained control of more territory and authority in the state.

They were, however, disinclined to capture Awadh outright and come face to face with the [[Maratha Confederacy|Maratha Empire]] and the remnants of the Mughal Empire. In 1798, the fifth Nawab [[Wazir Ali Khan]] alienated both his people and the British and was forced to abdicate. The British then helped [[Saadat Ali Khan II|Saadat Ali Khan]] take the throne.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://lucknow.me/Saadat-Ali-Khan.html|title = Saadat-Ali-Khan|access-date = 24 August 2014|website = Lucknow|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140612023841/http://lucknow.me/Saadat-Ali-Khan.html|archive-date = 12 June 2014|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref> He became a [[Puppet monarch|puppet king]], and in a treaty of 1801, yielded large part of Awadh to the East India Company while also agreeing to disband his own troops in favour of a hugely expensive, British-controlled army.

This treaty effectively made the state of Awadh a vassal of the [[East India Company]], although it continued to be part of the Mughal Empire in name until 1819. The treaty of 1801 proved a beneficial arrangement for the East India Company as they gained access to Awadh's vast treasuries, repeatedly digging into them for loans at reduced rates. In addition, the revenues from running Awadh's armed forces brought them useful returns while the territory acted as a buffer state. The Nawabs were ceremonial kings, busy with pomp and show. By the mid-nineteenth century, however, the British had grown impatient with the arrangement and demanded direct control over Awadh.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/673406/Awadh|title = Awadh|access-date = 27 August 2014|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140903202631/https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/673406/Awadh|archive-date = 3 September 2014|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

Lucknow was one of the major centres of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] and actively participated in [[Indian independence movement|India's independence movement]], emerging as a strategically important North Indian city. During the Rebellion, the majority of the East India Company's troops were recruited from both the people and nobility of Awadh. The rebels seized control of the state, and it took the British 18 months to reconquer the region. During that period, the [[garrison]] based at the [[The Residency, Lucknow|Residency]] in Lucknow was besieged by rebel forces during the [[Siege of Lucknow]]. The siege was relieved first by forces under the command of Sir [[Henry Havelock]] and Sir [[Sir James Outram, 1st Baronet|James Outram]], followed by a stronger force under Sir [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde|Colin Campbell]]. Today, the ruins of the Residency and the ''Shaheed Smarak'' offer an insight into Lucknow's role in the events of 1857.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://asi.nic.in/asi_museums_lucknow.asp|title = 1857 Memorial Museum, Residency, Lucknow|access-date = 27 August 2014|website = Archaeological Survey of India|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140627101444/http://asi.nic.in/asi_museums_lucknow.asp|archive-date = 27 June 2014|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

With the rebellion over, [[Oudh State|Oudh]] returned to British governance under a chief commissioner. In 1877, the offices of lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces and chief commissioner of Oudh were combined; then in 1902, the title of chief commissioner was dropped with the formation of the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh]], although Oudh still retained some marks of its former independence.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avadh-english-also-audh-or-oudh-an-ancient-cultural-and-administrative-region-lying-between-the-himalayas-and-the-ganges-i|title = AVADH|access-date = 27 August 2014|website = Iranica Online|publisher = Encyclopaedia Iranica|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141027161219/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avadh-english-also-audh-or-oudh-an-ancient-cultural-and-administrative-region-lying-between-the-himalayas-and-the-ganges-i|archive-date = 27 October 2014|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

The [[Khilafat Movement]] had an active base of support in Lucknow, creating united opposition to British rule. In 1901, after remaining the capital of Oudh since 1775, Lucknow, with a population of 264,049, was merged into the newly formed United Provinces of Agra and Oudh.<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Lucknow |volume=17 |page=106}}</ref> In 1920, the [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|provincial]] seat of government moved from [[Allahabad]] to Lucknow.

Lucknow witnessed some of the pivotal moments in the history of India. One is the first meeting of the stalwarts [[Mahatma Gandhi]], Jawaharlal Nehru and [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah|Mohd Ali Jinnah]] during the [[Indian National Congress]] session of 1916 (the [[Lucknow pact]] was signed and moderates and extremists came together through the efforts of [[Annie Besant]] during this session only).
The Congress President for that session, [[Ambica Charan Mazumdar|Ambica Charan Majumdar]] in his address said that "If the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] was buried at Surat, it is reborn in Lucknow in the garden of Wajid Ali Shah."

The [[Kakori conspiracy]] involving [[Ram Prasad Bismil]], [[Ashfaqulla Khan|Ashfaq Ullah Khan]], [[Rajendra Lahiri|Rajendra Nath Lahiri]], [[Roshan Singh]] and others, followed by the Kakori trial which captured the imagination of the country, also took place in Lucknow.<ref>{{cite web|title=Big Moments in Lucknow History|url=http://genieforcity.com/lucknow/history-lucknow.html|access-date=13 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818085223/http://genieforcity.com/lucknow/history-lucknow.html|archive-date=18 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Culturally, Lucknow has also had a tradition of courtesans,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/8083893 |title=Prostituting the Tawa'if: Nawabi Patronage and Colonial Regulation of Courtesans in Lucknow, 1847–1899 &#124; Zoya Sameen |publisher=Academia.edu |date=1 January 1970 |access-date=29 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208233238/http://www.academia.edu/8083893/Prostituting_the_Tawa_if_Nawabi_Patronage_and_Colonial_Regulation_of_Courtesans_in_Lucknow_1847-1899 |archive-date=8 February 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> with popular culture distilling it in the avatar of the fictional [[Umrao Jaan Ada|Umrao Jaan]].

Along with the rest of [[India]], Lucknow became independent from Britain on [[Independence Day (India)|15 August 1947]]. It has been listed as the 17th-fastest growing city in [[India]] and 74th in the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=World's fastest growing urban areas (1) |url=http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/urban_growth1.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125090345/http://citymayors.com/statistics/urban_growth1.html |archive-date=25 November 2010 |access-date=29 July 2015 |publisher=City Mayors}}</ref>

== Judicial institutions ==

There is a bench of the [[Allahabad High Court]] in Lucknow. Aside from this, Lucknow has a District & Sessions Court, five CBI Courts, one family court and two railway courts. The High Court Bench as well as the District & Sessions Court and the CBI courts are located in Qaiser Bagh, and the railway courts are in Charbagh.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lucknow/District Court in India {{!}} Official Website of District Court of India|url=https://districts.ecourts.gov.in/lucknow|access-date=2 November 2020|website=districts.ecourts.gov.in}}</ref>

People have often criticised various governments for being judicial focussed on central UP. Where western Uttar Pradesh is the economic center and has long demanded the setting up of another high court bench in west Uttar Pradesh.

Almost 54% of all cases reaching the High Court originate from the 22 districts of Western UP. Still, western Uttar Pradesh does not have a High Court. People have to travel 700&nbsp;km away to Allahabad for hearings. In fact 6 high courts (Shimla, Delhi, Jaipur, Chandigarh, Nainital, Jammu) from other states are closer than Allahabad from western Uttar Pradesh.

Western Uttar Pradesh has been advocating to have a high court bench in Meerut so that Western Uttar Pradesh can get justice. This is important as west UP accounts for '''51.71% of the state GDP.'''<ref>{{Cite news |last=Rai |first=Sandeep |date=3 September 2023 |title=Lawyers rally for Meerut HC bench, suspend all work on Saturdays |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/lawyers-rally-for-meerut-hc-bench-suspend-all-work-on-saturdays/articleshow/103318823.cms |work=The Times of India |issn=0971-8257 |access-date=26 October 2023}}</ref>

Lucknow has the third largest metro network in the state after [[Noida]], [[Meerut]] and [[Ghaziabad]].

In February, Chief Minister [[Akhilesh Yadav]] approved to set up of a metro rail system for the state capital. It is divided into two corridors the north–south corridor connecting Munshipulia to CCS International Airport and the east–west corridor connecting Charbagh Railway Station to Vasant Kunj. This will be the most expensive public transport system in the state but will provide a rapid means of mass transport to decongest traffic on city roads. Construction of the first phase will be complete by March 2017. The completion of metro rail project is the primary object of Uttar Pradesh government currently headed by the chief minister [[Yogi Adityanath]]<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.railnews.co.in/dmrc-assures-lucknow-metro-rail-first-phase-completion-by-february-2017/|title = DMRC assures Lucknow Metro first phase completion|access-date = 27 August 2014|website = railnews|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140819130005/http://www.railnews.co.in/dmrc-assures-lucknow-metro-rail-first-phase-completion-by-february-2017/|archive-date = 19 August 2014|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

The {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=in|order=flip}} tall [[Rumi Darwaza]], built by Nawab Asaf-ud-daula (r. 1775–1797) in 1784, served as the entrance to the city of Lucknow. It is also known as the Turkish Gateway, as it was erroneously thought to be identical to the gateway at [[Constantinople]]. The edifice provides the west entrance to the Great Imambara and is embellished with lavish decorations.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/addorimss/t/019addor0002664u00000000.html|title = Roomi Darwaza|access-date = 13 August 2014|website = The Turkish Gate (Rumi Darwaza), Lucknow.|publisher = The British Library|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140814020817/http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/addorimss/t/019addor0002664u00000000.html|archive-date = 14 August 2014|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

Various architectural styles can be seen in the historical areas of Lucknow. The [[University of Lucknow]] shows a huge inspiration from the European style while [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture]] is prominently present in the [[Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Sabha building]] and [[Charbagh Railway station]]. [[Dilkusha Kothi]] is the remains of a palace constructed by the British resident Major [[Gore Ouseley]] around 1800 and showcases [[English Baroque]] architecture. It served as a hunting lodge for the [[Nawab of Awadh]]s and as a summer resort.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.lucknowonline.in/city-guide/dilkusha-garden-lucknow|title = Dilkusha Garden Lucknow|access-date = 27 August 2014|website = Lucknow Online|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140903110332/http://www.lucknowonline.in/city-guide/dilkusha-garden-lucknow|archive-date = 3 September 2014|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

The [[Chattar Manzil]], which served as the palace for the rulers of Awadh and their wives is topped by an umbrella-like dome and so named on account of ''Chattar'' being the Hindi word for "umbrella".
Opposite Chattar Manzil stands the 'Lal Baradari' built by Nawab [[Saadat Ali Khan I]] between 1789 and 1814. It functioned as a throne room at coronations for the royal courts. The building is now used as a museum and contains delicately executed portraits of men who played major roles in the administration of the kingdom of Oudh.

Another example of mixed architectural styles is [[La Martiniere Lucknow|La Martiniere College]], which shows a fusion of Indian and European ideas. It was built by Major-General [[Claude Martin]] who was born in [[Lyon]] and died in Lucknow on 13 September 1800. Originally named "Constantia", the ceilings of the building are domed with no wooden beams used for construction.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Historic Lucknow|last = Hay|first = Sidney|publisher = Asian Educational Services|isbn = 81-206-0964-6|year = 2001|url = {{GBurl|id=yc3sqGgXgzkC}}}}</ref> Glimpses of [[Gothic architecture]] can also be seen in the college building.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.lamartinierelucknow.org/about/patron|title = About The Founder|access-date = 27 August 2014|website = La Martiniere College Lucknow|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150413181243/http://www.lamartinierelucknow.org/about/patron|archive-date = 13 April 2015|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

Lucknow's [[Bara Imambara|Asafi Imambara]] exhibits vaulted halls as its architectural speciality.
The Bara Imambara, Chhota Imambara and Rumi Darwaza stand in testament to the city's Nawabi mixture of Mughlai and Turkish styles of architecture while La Martiniere college bears witness to the Indo-European style. Even the new buildings are fashioned using characteristic domes and pillars, and at night these illuminated monuments become the city's main attractions.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://tcpomud.gov.in/Divisions/IEP/Urban%20Land%20Price%20Scenario%20Lucknow/Chapter-3(Rich%20Urban%20Heritage%20Lcknow).doc|title = Rich Urban Heritage of Lucknow|access-date = 27 August 2014|website = Town and Country Planning Organisation|publisher = Government of India|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140903111516/http://tcpomud.gov.in/Divisions/IEP/Urban%20Land%20Price%20Scenario%20Lucknow/Chapter-3(Rich%20Urban%20Heritage%20Lcknow).doc|archive-date = 3 September 2014|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

Around [[Hazratganj]], the city's central shopping area, there is a fusion of old and modern architecture. It has a multi-level parking lot in place of an old and dilapidated police station making way for extending the corridors into pebbled pathways, adorned with piazzas, green areas and wrought-iron and cast-iron lamp-posts, reminiscent of the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian era]], flank both sides of the street.<ref name="ibnlive.in.com 141311-3">{{cite web |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/magic-makeover-for-lucknows-famed-hazratganj/141311-3.html |title=Magic makeover for Lucknow's famed Hazratganj – IBNLive |publisher=IBN Live |access-date=4 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730013905/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/magic-makeover-for-lucknows-famed-hazratganj/141311-3.html |archive-date=30 July 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Modern-day Lucknowites are known for their polite and polished way of speaking which is noticed by visitors.

[[File:263479-special-biryani-at-tunday.jpg|thumb|left|Tunday's Gelawati Kababs, Lucknow's speciality]]

The Awadh region has its own distinct Nawabi-style cuisine. Since ages, the ''Bawarchis'' (chefs) and ''Rakabdars'' (royal chefs) have developed great finesse in cooking and presentation of food, under royal patronage. This gave rise to the art of cooking over a slow fire (or ''Dum'' style cooking), which has become synonymous with "Awadhi" cuisine. These ''Bawarchis'' added elaborately prepared dishes like ''kababs'', ''kormas'', ''kaliya'', ''nahari-kulchas'', ''zarda'', ''sheermal'', ''roomali rotis'' and ''warqi parathas'' to the traditional "Awadhi" ''dastarkhwaan'' (feast of dishes).<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|url=http://www.lucknow.nic.in/cuisine.htm |title=Cuisine of Lucknow |publisher=Lucknow |access-date=26 March 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070819044302/http://lucknow.nic.in/cuisine.htm |archive-date = 19 August 2007}}</ref> The best-known dishes of this area consist of [[biryani]]s, [[kebab]]s and breads.

* [[Muharram]]
:{{main|Azadari in Lucknow}}
:Lucknow is known as a seat of [[Shia Islam]] and the epitome of Shia culture in India. Muslims observe Muharram, the first month of the [[Islamic calendar]] and on Ashura (the tenth day of the month) mourn the memory of [[Husayn ibn Ali|Imam Husain]], grandson of the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.al-islam.org/story-of-the-holy-kaaba-and-its-people-shabbar/third-imam-husayn-ibn-ali|title = The Third Imam, Husayn Ibn 'Ali|access-date = 28 August 2014|website = Al-Islam|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140903111455/http://www.al-islam.org/story-of-the-holy-kaaba-and-its-people-shabbar/third-imam-husayn-ibn-ali|archive-date = 3 September 2014|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Muharram processions in Lucknow have a special significance and began during the reign of the Awadh Nawabs.

:Processions such as ''Shahi Zarih'', ''Jaloos-e-Mehndi'', ''Alam-e-Ashura'' and ''[[Chup Tazia]]'' had special significance by the Shia community and were affected with great religious zeal and fervour until 1977 the government of Uttar Pradesh banned public Azadari processions. For the following twenty years, processions and gatherings took place in private or community spaces including Talkatora Karbala, [[Bara Imambara]] (Imambara Asifi), [[Chota Imambara]] (Imambara Husainabad), Dargah Hazrat Abbas, Shah Najaf and [[Imambara Ghufran Ma'ab]]. The ban was partially lifted in 1997 and Shias were successful in taking out the first Azadari procession in January 1998 on the 21st of [[Ramadan]], the Muslim fasting month. The Shias are authorised to stage nine processions out of the nine hundred that are listed in the register of the Shias.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://lucknowlive12.blogspot.in/p/festivals-in-lucknow.html|title = Festivals in Lucknow|access-date = 27 August 2014|website = lucknowlive|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140903143251/http://lucknowlive12.blogspot.in/p/festivals-in-lucknow.html|archive-date = 3 September 2014|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

Lucknow is known for embroidery works including [[Chikan (embroidery)|''chikankari'']], ''[[zari]]'', ''[[zardozi]]'', ''kamdani'' and ''gota'' making (gold lace weaving).<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.lucknow-chikan-house.com/what-we-offer.html|title = The art of chikankari|access-date = 28 August 2014|website = Lucknow Chikan House|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://archive.today/20120905042528/http://www.lucknow-chikan-house.com/what-we-offer.html|archive-date = 5 September 2012|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

''Chikankari'' is an embroidery work well known all over India. This 400-year-old art in its present form was developed in Lucknow and it remains the only location where the skill is practised today. ''Chikankari'' constitutes 'shadow work' and is a delicate and artistic hand embroidery done using white thread on fine white cotton cloth such as fine muslin or chiffon. Yellowish ''muga'' silk is sometimes used in addition to the white thread. The work is done on caps, ''[[kurta]]''s, ''[[sari]]''s, scarfs, and other vestments.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://lucknowcity.com/chikankari.php|title = Chikankari|access-date = 28 August 2014|website = Lucknow City|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140903100747/http://lucknowcity.com/chikankari.php|archive-date = 3 September 2014|df = dmy-all}}</ref> The ''chikan'' industry, almost unknown under the Nawabs, has not only survived but has flourished. About 2,500 entrepreneurs have engaged in manufacturing ''chikan'' for sale in local, national and international markets with Lucknow the largest exporter of ''chikan'' embroidered garments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chikanbarn.com/Resources/85fd99ef-58a6-4bd8-9a2c-09494d8b8d20/Documents/671/Popularity%20of%20Chikankari%20outside%20India%20and%20its%20Export.pdf |title=Popularity of Chikankari outside India and exports |access-date=27 August 2014 |publisher=chikanbarn |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728214131/http://www.chikanbarn.com/Resources/85fd99ef-58a6-4bd8-9a2c-09494d8b8d20/Documents/671/Popularity%20of%20Chikankari%20outside%20India%20and%20its%20Export.pdf |archive-date=28 July 2014 }}</ref>
