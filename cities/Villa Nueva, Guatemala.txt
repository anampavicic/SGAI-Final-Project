==History==

=== Amatitlán Department creation===

[[File:Mariano Rivera Paz.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait of [[Mariano Rivera Paz]].  Rivera Paz was governor of the State of Guatemala when he declared Amatitlán an independent district in 1839.]]

During governor [[Mariano Rivera Paz]]' time in office, a decree was issued on 6 November 1839 declaring Amatitlán and independent district, which also included [[Palín, Escuintla|Palín]] and Villa Nueva.<ref name=muni/> The decree says: 
# "The city of [[Amatitlán]], [[Palín, Escuintla|San Cristóbal Palín]], Villa Nueva, [[San Miguel Petapa|San Miguel and Santa Inés Petapa]] and all the annexed locations to these settlements will form an independent district for its political government and will be under the charge of a Lieutenant Corregidor, who will act according to the applicable law starting on 2 October of this year and will earn a thousand pesos a year". 
# "In the same district there will be a local court to impart justice".<ref name=muni/>

The district changed its name to Amatitlán Department according to the executive order of 8 May 1866 of field Marshall [[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]] government.<ref name=muni/>

=== Amatitlán Department dissolution and creation of the Villa Nueva municipality===

Amatitlán Department was abolished by decree 2081 of 29 April 1935 of president general [[Jorge Ubico]] regime. This decree literally reads:

# Amatitlán Departament is abolished
# Municipalities of [[Amatitlán]], Villa Nueva, [[San Miguel Petapa]] and [[Villa Canales]] are incorporated into [[Guatemala Department]] and those of [[Palín, Escuintla|Palín]] and [[San Vicente Pacaya]] to the [[Escuintla Department]].
# The executive branch will issue the proper instructions to comply with this decree, which will be in effect on 1 July of this year".<ref name=muni>{{harvnb|Municipalidad de Palín|2007|p=}}</ref>
