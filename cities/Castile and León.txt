'''Castile and León'''{{efn|{{langx|es|Castilla y León}} {{IPA|es|kasˈtiʎaj leˈon||Es-es_castilla-y-leon_001.ogg}}; {{lang-ast-leo|Castiella y Llión}} {{IPA|ast|kasˈtjeʎa i ʎiˈoŋ|}}; {{langx|gl|Castela e León}} {{IPA|gl|kasˈtɛlɐ ɪ leˈoŋ|}}}} is an [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] in northwestern [[Spain]].  Castile and León is the largest autonomous community in Spain by area, covering 94,222&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. It is, however, sparsely populated, with a population density below 30/km<sup>2</sup>. While [[Capital of Castile and León|a capital has not been explicitly declared]], the seats of the executive and legislative powers are set in [[Valladolid]] by law, and for all purposes that city (also the most populated municipality) serves as the ''de facto'' regional capital.

Castile and León is a landlocked region, bordered by [[Portugal]] as well as by the Spanish autonomous communities of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Asturias]], [[Cantabria]], the [[Basque Autonomous Community|Basque Country]], [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], [[Aragon]], [[Castilla–La Mancha]], the [[Community of Madrid]] and [[Extremadura]]. Chiefly comprising the northern half of the [[Meseta Central|Inner Plateau]], it is surrounded by mountain barriers (the [[Cantabrian Mountains]] to the North, the [[Sistema Central]] to the South and the [[Sistema Ibérico]] to the East) and most of the territory is drained by the [[Douro River]] (Spanish: ''Duero''), flowing west toward the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

The autonomous community was created in 1983 by grouping the provinces of [[Province of León|León]], [[Province of Zamora|Zamora]], [[Province of Salamanca|Salamanca]] (all three traditionally attached to the [[region of León]]), [[Province of Ávila|Ávila]], [[Province of Burgos|Burgos]], [[Province of Palencia|Palencia]], [[Province of Segovia|Segovia]], [[province of Soria|Soria]] and [[province of Valladolid|Valladolid]] (attached to [[Old Castile]]).<ref>{{Cite news |last=Carretero |first=Anselmo |date=1981-09-17 |title=Los casos de Cantabria, la Rioja y Segovia |language=es |work=El País |url=https://elpais.com/diario/1981/09/18/espana/369612007_850215.html |access-date=2022-06-15 |issn=1134-6582 |archive-date=June 15, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220615175704/https://elpais.com/diario/1981/09/18/espana/369612007_850215.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

<!--although it existed for the first time during the [[First Spanish Republic]] in the 19th century. [[Kingdom of León|León]] first appeared as a Kingdom in 910, whilst the Kingdom of Castile gained an independent identity in 1065 and was intermittently held in personal union with León before merging with it [[Kingdom of León#León and Castile|in 1230]]. Though the kings of Castile and León initially continued to take the title King of León as the superior title, and to use a lion as part of their standard, power in fact became centralized in Castile, as exemplified by the [[Leonese dialect|Leonese]] language's replacement by Spanish. The Kingdom of León and the Kingdom of Castile kept different parliaments, different flags, different coin and different laws until the Modern Era, when Spain, like other European states, centralized governmental power in 1833. The autonomous community of Castile and León is the result of the union in 1983 of nine provinces: the three that, after the territorial division of 1833, were part of the [[Region of León]] and six attached to the [[Old Castile]], except in the latter case the provinces of Santander (current community of [[Cantabria]]) and Logroño (current [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]).

The Statute of Autonomy of Castile and León, reformed most recently in 2007, establishes in the sixth article of its preliminary title the symbols of the community's exclusive identity. These are: the [[Coat of arms of Castile and León|coat of arms]], the [[Flag of Castile and León|flag]], the [[Banner of Castile and León|banner]] and the anthem. Its legal protection is the same as that corresponding to the [[Symbols of Spain|symbols of the State]] -whose outrages are classified as crime in article 543 of the [[Penal Code of Spain|Penal Code]]-.<ref name="Statute">{{Citation |author=[[Cortes Generales]] |title=Organic Law 10/1995, of 23 November of the Penal Code |publisher=[[Agencia Estatal Boletín Oficial del Estado]] |work=[[Boletín Oficial del Estado]] no. 281, of 24 November 1995 |date=1995 |url=http://www.boe.es/buscar/pdf/1995/BOE-A-1995-25444-consolidado.pdf |access-date=3 January 2018 |archive-date=27 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171127162341/https://www.boe.es/buscar/pdf/1995/BOE-A-1995-25444-consolidado.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the articulated statuary, the coat of arms is defined as follows:<ref name="Statute"/>
{{Blockquote |The coat of arms of Castile and León is a stamped shield by open royal [[Crown (heraldry)|crown]], barracked in cross. The first and fourth quartering: in the field of [[gules]], a merloned golden castle of three merlons, drafted of sable and rinse of [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]]. The second and third quartering: in a silver field, a rampant lion of purple, lingued, dyed and armed with gules, crowned with gold.}}

Likewise, the flag is described as follows:<ref name="Statute"/>
{{Blockquote|The flag of Castile and León is quartered and contains the symbols of Castile and León, as described in the previous section. The flag will fly in all the centres and official acts of the Community, to the right of the Spanish flag.}}

Following the same wording, the banner is constituted by the shield quartered on a traditional [[crimson]] background. The Statute also expresses: "The anthem and the other symbols [...] will be regulated by specific law". After the promulgation of the fundamental norm, this law was not promulgated, so the anthem does not exist, but ''de iure'' is a symbol of autonomy.<ref name="Statute"/>

[[File:Homo heidelbergensis. Museo de Prehistoria de Valencia.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Miguelón|Skull number 5]]'' of ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]''. It appeared in the 1992 campaign, extracted from the [[Atapuerca Mountains]].]]
Several archaeological findings show that in prehistoric times these lands were already inhabited. In the [[Atapuerca Mountains]] have been found many bones of the ancestors of ''Homo sapiens'', making these findings one of the most important to determine the history of human evolution. The most important discovery that catapulted the site to international fame was the remains of ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]''.

Before the arrival of the Romans, it is known that the territories that make up Castile and León today were occupied by various [[Celts|Celtic peoples]], such as [[Vaccaei]], [[Autrigones]], [[Turmodigi]], the [[Vettones]], [[Astures]] or [[Celtiberians]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Prichard |first=James Cowles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dp9RAAAAcAAJ&dq=celts+and+iberia,+leon&pg=PA67 |title=The Eastern Origin of the Celtic Nations Proved by a Comparison of Their Dialects with the Sanskrit, Greek, Latin Ant Teutonic Languages: Forming a Supplement to "Researches Into the Physical History of Mankind" |date=1857 |language=en}}</ref> The Roman conquest resulted in warring with the local tribes. One particularly famous episode was the siege of [[Numantia]], an old town located near the current city of [[Soria]].

The [[Romanization (cultural)|romanization]] was unstoppable, and to this day great Roman works of art have remained, mainly the [[Aqueduct of Segovia]] as well as many archaeological remains such as those of the ancient [[Clunia]], [[Salt mines of Poza de la Sal]] and the [[vía de la Plata]] pathway, which crosses the west of the community from [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]] (''[[Asturica Augusta]]'') to the capital of modern [[Extremadura]], [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]] (''[[Emerita Augusta]]'').

[[File:Toros de Guisando.jpg|thumb|left| [[Bulls of Guisando]], in [[El Tiemblo]], [[Province of Ávila|Ávila]]. These ''[[verraco]]s'', of [[Celts|Celtic]] origin, are found in many towns of the western half of Castile and León.]]
With the fall of Rome, the lands were occupied militarily by the [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] peoples of Germanic origin. The subsequent arrival of the Arabs was followed by a process known as the ''[[Reconquista]]'' (Reconquest). In the mountainous area of [[Asturias]], a small Christian kingdom was created that opposed the Islamic presence in the Peninsula. It proclaimed itself an heir of the last Visigoth kings, who in turn had been deeply romanized. This resistance of Visigoth-Roman heritage, supported by Christianity, was becoming increasingly strong and expanding to the south, eventually establishing its court in the city of [[León, Spain|León]], becoming the [[Kingdom of León]]. To encourage the repopulation of the newly reconquered lands, a number of [[fuero]]s ("letters of repopulation") were granted by the monarchs.

[[File:Castro de Ulaca 10 by-dpc.jpg|thumb|right|Celtiberian [[castro of Ulaca]].]]
In the [[Middle Ages]], Christian pilgrimages to [[Santiago de Compostela]] were popularized. The [[Camino de Santiago]], running along the northern part of the region, was a major part of the route of pilgrimage, so it contributed to the spread of European cultural innovations throughout the peninsula. Today the Camino is still an important touristic and cultural attraction.

In 1188, the [[Basílica de San Isidoro, León|basilica of San Isidoro of León]] was the setting of the first [[Cortes of León of 1188|parliamentary body]] in the history of Europe, with the participation of the [[Estates of the realm#Third Estate|Third Estate]]. The king who summoned it was [[Alfonso IX of León]].

The legal basis for the kingdom was the [[Roman law]], and because of this the kings increasingly wanted more power, like the Roman emperors. This is very clearly seen in the ''[[Siete Partidas]]'' of [[Alfonso X of Castile]], which shows the imperial monism that the king sought. The King did not want to be a ''[[primus inter pares]]'', but the source of the law.

[[File:AcueductoSegovia04.JPG|thumb|left| [[Aqueduct of Segovia]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] construction.]]
Simultaneously, a county of this Christian kingdom of León, began to acquire autonomy and to expand. This is the primitive [[County of Castile]], which would grow into a powerful kingdom among the Christian kingdoms of the Peninsula. The first Castilian count was [[Fernán González of Castile|Fernán González]].

[[File:Gormaz, Fortaleza califal pña.jpg|thumb|200px| [[Castle of Gormaz]]. It was the largest fortress in Europe after its expansion in 956, in the river Duero (Douro) defense line.]]
León and Castile continued to expand to the South, even beyond the [[Douro]] river, seeking to conquest lands under Islamic rule. That was the time of the [[Chanson de geste|''Cantares de gesta'']], poems which recount the great deeds of the Christian nobles who fought against the Muslim enemy. Despite this, Christian and Muslim kings maintained diplomatic relations. One clear example is [[El Cid|Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, ''El Cid'']], paradigm of the medieval Christian knight, who fought both for Christian and Muslim kings.

The origin of the definitive dynastic unification of the kingdoms of Castile and León, which had been separated for just seven decades, was in 1194. [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] and [[Alfonso IX of León]] signed in [[Tordehumos]] the treaty that pacified the area of [[Tierra de Campos]] and laid the foundation for a future reunification of the kingdoms, consolidated in 1230 with [[Ferdinand III of Castile|Ferdinand III ''the Saint'']].

During the [[Late Middle Ages]] there was an economic and political crisis produced by a series of bad harvests and by disputes between nobles and the Crown for power, as well as between different contenders for the throne. In the [[Cortes of Valladolid (1295)|Cortes of Valladolid of 1295]], [[Ferdinand IV of Castile|Ferdinand IV]] is recognized as king. The painting [[María de Molina presents her son Fernando IV in the Cortes of Valladolid of 1295]] presides today the Spanish Congress of Deputies along with a painting of the [[Cortes of Cádiz]], emphasizing the parliamentarian importance that has all the development of Cortes in Castile and León, despite its subsequent decline. The Crown was becoming more authoritarian and the nobility more dependent on it.

The ''[[Reconquista]]'' continued advancing from the thriving [[Crown of Castile]] to the south, and culminated with the [[Granada War]] against the last Muslim stronghold in the Iberian peninsula, the [[Emirate of Granada|Nasrid Kingdom of Granada]], which [[The Surrender of Granada|surrendered]] on 2 January 1492.

===Antecedents of the autonomy===
In June 1978, Castile and León obtained the pre-autonomy, through the creation of [[General council of Castile and Leon|General council of Castile and León]] by [[Royal Decree-Law (Spain)|Royal Decree-Law]] 20/1978, of 13 June.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

In times of the [[First Spanish Republic]] (1873–1874), the [[Federal Democratic Republican Party|federal republicans]] conceived the project to create a federated state of eleven provinces in the valley of the Spanish Douro, that would also have included the provinces of [[Cantabria|Santander]] and [[La Rioja (Spain)|Logroño]].{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} Very few years before, in 1869, as part of a manifesto, federal republicans representatives of the 17 provinces of Albacete, Ávila, Burgos, Ciudad Real, Cuenca, Guadalajara, León, Logroño, Madrid, Palencia, Salamanca, Santander, Segovia, Soria, Toledo, Valladolid and Zamora proposed in the so-called [[Castilian Federal Pact]] the conformation of an entity formed by two different "states": the state of Old Castile -that is presently built for the current Castilian-Leonese provinces and the provinces of Logroño and Santander-, and the state of New Castile -which conforms to the current provinces of [[Castile-La Mancha]] plus the [[province of Madrid]]-. The end of the Republic, at the beginning of 1874, thwarted the initiative.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}
[[File:Minutos de Historia. Por la Autonomía de Castilla y León, 1978.jpg|thumb|right|Manifestation of 1978 in Valladolid that sued a Statute of Autonomy for the region.]]

In 1921, on the occasion of the fourth centenary of the [[Battle of Villalar]], the [[City Council of Santader|Santander City Council]] advocated the creation of a Castilian and Leonese Commonwealth of eleven provinces, an idea that would be maintained in later years. At the end of 1931 and beginning of 1932, from León, [[Eugenio Merino]] elaborated a text in which the base of a [[Castilian-Leonese regionalism]] was put. The text was published in the Diario de León newspaper.<ref name="catechism">Juan-Miguel Álvarez Domínguez.[http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/fichero_articulo?codigo=2381262&orden=0 ''The Regionalist Catechism of Don Eugenio, an example of Castilian-Leonese regionalism sponsored by León''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719235215/http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/fichero_articulo?codigo=2381262&orden=0 |date=19 July 2011 }}. 1931, Argutorio, No. 19 (2nd semester 2007), pp. 32-36.</ref>

During the [[Second Spanish Republic]], especially in 1936, there was a great regionalist activity favorable to a region of eleven provinces, and even bases for the Statute of Autonomy were elaborated. The ''Diario de León'' advocated for the formalization of this initiative and the constitution of an autonomous region with these words:
{{Blockquote|Join in a personality León and Old Castile around the great basin of the Douro, without to fall now into provincial rivalries.|''Diario de León'', 22 May 1936.}}
The end of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the beginning of [[Francoist Spain|Franco regime]] ended the aspirations of the autonomy for the region. The philosopher [[José Ortega y Gasset]] collected this scheme in his publications.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://biblioteca2.uclm.es/biblioteca/ceclm/websCECLM/transici%C3%B3n/PDF/03-02.%20Texto.pdf |title=La propuesta autonomista de Ortega y Gasset: un claro antecedente de la configuración autonómica del Estado español de 1978 |author=Alejandro De Haro Honrubia |publisher=University of Castilla-La Mancha |access-date=5 January 2018 |archive-date=8 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308075425/http://biblioteca2.uclm.es/biblioteca/ceclm/websCECLM/transici%C3%B3n/PDF/03-02.%20Texto.pdf |url-status=dead}}</ref>

After the death of Francisco Franco, regionalist, autonomist and nationalist organizations ([[Castilian-Leonese regionalism]] and [[Castilian nationalism]]) as [[Regional Alliance of Castile and León]] (1975), [[Regional Institute of Castile and León]] (1976) or the [[Autonomous Nationalist Party of Castile and León]] (1977). Later after the extinction of these formations arose in 1993 [[Regionalist Unity of Castile and León]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/ESPANA/CASTILLA_Y_LEON/UNIDAD_REGIONALISTA_DE_CASTILLA_Y_LEON/PARTIDO_NACIONALISTA_DE_CASTILLA_Y_LEON/grupos/politicos/fusionan/partido/regionalista/Castilla/Leon/elpepiesp/19920427elpepinac_6/Tes |title=Seis grupos políticos se fusionan en un partido regionalista en Castilla y León |author=El País (newspaper) |newspaper=El País |date=26 April 1992 |access-date=29 November 2009 |archive-date=5 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105094656/http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/ESPANA/CASTILLA_Y_LEON/UNIDAD_REGIONALISTA_DE_CASTILLA_Y_LEON/PARTIDO_NACIONALISTA_DE_CASTILLA_Y_LEON/grupos/politicos/fusionan/partido/regionalista/Castilla/Leon/elpepiesp/19920427elpepinac_6/Tes |url-status=live }}</ref>

At the same time, others of [[Leonesism|Leonesist]] character arose, such as the [[Leonese Autonomous Group]] (1978) or [[Regionalist Party of the Leonese Country]] (1980), which advocated the creation of a Leonese autonomous community, composed of provinces of [[Province of León|León]], [[Province of Salamanca|Salamanca]] and [[Province of Zamora|Zamora]]. The popular and political support that maintained the uniprovincial autonomy in [[Province of León|León]] became very important in that city.

===Autonomy===
The autonomous community of Castile and León is the result of the union in 1983 of nine provinces: the three that, after the territorial division of 1833, by which the provinces were created, were ascribed to the [[León (historical region)|Region of León]], and six ascribed to [[Old Castile]]; however 2 provinces of Old Castile were not included: Santander (current community of [[Cantabria]]) and Logroño (current [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]).
[[File:Villalar de los Comuneros 1977.jpg|thumb|Villalar de los Comuneros, 23 April 1977]]
[[File:Villalar de los Comuneros 1977 02.jpg|thumb|Villalar de los Comuneros, 23 April 1977]]
In the case of [[Cantabria]] the creation of an [[autonomous community]] was advocated for historical, cultural and geographical reasons, while in [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]] the process was more complex due to the existence of three alternatives, all based on historical and socio-economic reasons: union with Castile and León (advocated by the [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain)|Union of the Democratic Centre]] political party), union to a Basque-Navarrese community (supported by the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Party]] and [[Communist Party of Spain|Communist Party]]) or creation of an uniprovincial autonomy; the latter option was chosen because it had more support among the population.

After the creation of the Castilian-Leonese pre-autonomous body, which was supported by the Provincial Council of León in its agreement of April 16, 1980, this institution revoked its original agreement on January 13, 1983, just as the draft of the Organic Law entered the Spanish parliament. The Constitutional Court determined which of those contradictory agreements was valid in the ''Sentence 89/1984 of September 28''; it declares that the subject of the process is no longer, as in its preliminary phase, the councils and municipalities, but the new body.

After the sentence, there were several demonstrations in León in favor of the ''León alone'' option (see [[Leonesism]]), one of them according to some sources brought together a number close to 90&nbsp;000 people,<ref>''Diario de León'' (newspaper), 5 May 1984.</ref> This was the highest concentration held in the city in the Democratic period until the demonstrations rejecting the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]].<ref>''Diario de León'', 13 March 2004.</ref>

In an agreement adopted on 31 July 1981, the Provincial Council of Segovia decided to exercise the initiative so that [[Segovia]] could be constituted as a uniprovincial autonomous community, but in the municipalities of the province the situation was equal between the supporters of the uniprovincial autonomy and the supporters of the union.

[[File:Celebración del día de Villalar, 1985.jpg|thumb|Celebration of the [[Castile and León Day|Villalar Day]] in 1985.]]
The City Council of [[Cuéllar]] initially adhered to this autonomic initiative in agreement adopted by the corporation on October 5, 1981. However, another agreement adopted by the same corporation dated December 3 of the same year revoked the previous one and the process was paralyzed pending the processing of an appeal filed by the provincial council against this last agreement; this change of opinion of the city council of Cuéllar tipped the scales in the province towards the autonomy with the rest of Castile and León, but it was an agreement that arrived out of time. Finally the province of Segovia was incorporated into Castile and León along with the other eight provinces and legal coverage was given through the ''Organic Law 5/1983'' for "reasons of national interest", as provided for in article 144 c of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Spanish Constitution]] for those provinces that have not exercised their right on time.

Since 2019, the ''[[Ayuntamiento (Spain)|ayuntamientos]]'' of several municipalities of the province of León (including the capital's) have passed motions to propose the split of the provinces of the region of León from Castile and León and become a standalone autonomous community.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://revistaseug.ugr.es/index.php/polygob/article/view/26056/27183|last=Castro Ruiz|first=José Ángel|year=2023|title=El movimiento leonesista desde el proceso autonómico hasta la actualidad|journal=Política y Gobernanza.

==Geography==
[[File:Spain Castile and León relieve location map.png|right|thumb|Map of the relief of the autonomous community]]

===Location===
Castile and León is a landlocked [[autonomous community]], located in the north-western quadrant of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Its territory borders on the north with the uniprovincial communities of [[Asturias]] and [[Cantabria]], as well as with the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] ([[Biscay]] and [[Álava]]); to the east with the uniprovincial community of [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]] and with [[Aragon]] ([[province of Zaragoza]]), to the south with the [[Community of Madrid]], [[Castile-La Mancha]] (provinces of [[Province of Toledo|Toledo]] and [[Province of Guadalajara|Guadalajara]]) and [[Extremadura]] ([[province of Cáceres]]) and to the west with [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (provinces of [[province of Lugo|Lugo]] and [[Province of Ourense|Ourense]]) and [[Portugal]] ([[Bragança District]] and [[Guarda District]]).

===Orography===
[[File:Cornion zoom.jpg|thumb|right| [[Picos de Europa]] in the province of León.]]
[[File:SIERRA DE GREDOS.JPG|thumb| [[Sierra de Gredos]] range in the [[Sistema Central]].]]
The morphology of Castile and León consists, for the most part, of the northern half of the [[Meseta Central]] (''Meseta Norte'') and a belt of mountainous reliefs. The Meseta Central is a high plateau with an average altitude close to {{cvt|800|m}} [[Altitude|above sea-level]]; it is covered by deposited clay materials that have given rise to a dry and arid landscape.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

===Geology===
The Northern Plateau (Meseta Norte) is constituted by Paleozoic sockets. At the beginning of the [[Mesozoic|Mesozoic Era]], once the [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian folding]] that raised the current [[Central Europe]] and the Gallaeci zone of [[Spain]], the deposited materials were dragged by the erosive action of the rivers.

During the [[alpine orogeny]], the materials that formed the plateau broke through multiple points. From this fracture rose the [[Montes de León|mountains of León]], with mountains of not much height and, constituting the spine of the Plateau (Meseta), the Cantabrian Mountains and the Sistema Central, formed by materials such as granite or metamorphic slates.

===Hydrography===

====Rivers====
{{Main|Category:Rivers of Castile and León}}

;Douro basin
[[File:Zamora (9223963842).jpg|thumb|The Douro passing through [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]].]]
The main hydrographic network of Castile and León is constituted by the [[Douro|Douro river]] and its tributaries. From its source in the [[Picos de Urbión]], in Soria, to its mouth in the Portuguese city of [[Porto]], the Douro covers 897&nbsp;km. From the north descend the [[Pisuerga]], the [[Valderaduey]] and the [[Esla (river)|Esla]] rivers, its tributaries more plentiful and by the east, with less water in its flows, highlight the [[Adaja]] and the [[Duratón (river)|Duratón]]. After passing the town of [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]], the Douro is confined between the canyons of the [[Arribes del Duero Natural Park]], bordering with [[Portugal]]. On the left bank are important tributaries such as [[Tormes]], [[Huebra]], [[Águeda (river)|Águeda]], [[Côa River|Côa]] and Paiva, all from [[Sistema Central]]. On the right they reach the [[Sabor (river)|Sabor]], the Tua and the [[Tâmega (river)|Tâmega]], born in the [[Galician Massif]]. After the Arribes area, the Douro turns west into Portugal until it empties into the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

; Other watersheds
Several rivers of the community pour their waters into the [[Ebro basin]], in Palencia, Burgos and Soria ([[Jalón (river)|Jalón river]]), that of [[Miño-Sil river confederation|Miño-Sil]] in León and Zamora, that of the [[Tagus basin|Tagus]] in Ávila and Salamanca (rivers [[Tiétar (river)|Tiétar]] and [[Alberche]] and [[Alagón (river)|Alagón]] respectively) and [[Cantabrian river confederation|Cantabrian basin]] in the provinces through which the Cantabrian Mountains extends.

====Lakes and reservoirs====
[[File:007333 - Provincia de Zamora (8707601613) edited.jpg|thumb|Of glacial origin, the [[Sanabria Lake]] is the largest natural freshwater lake in Spain.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Limnetica|volume=8|issue=1|url=https://www.limnetica.net/documentos/limnetica/limnetica-8-1-p-49.pdf|year=1992|title=The Sanabria Lake.

In addition to the rivers, the Douro basin also hosts a large number of lakes and lagoons such as the [[Negra de Urbión Lake]], in the [[Picos de Urbión]], the [[Grande de Gredos Lake]], in Gredos, the [[Sanabria Lake]], in Zamora or the [[La Nava de Fuentes Lake]] in Palencia. Also emphasize a great amount of reservoirs, fed by the water coming from the rains and the thaw of the snowy summits. Thus, Castile and León, despite not having abundant rainfall, is one of the communities in Spain with the highest level of water dammed.

Many of these natural lakes are being used as an economic resource, boosting rural tourism and helping to conserve ecosystems. The Sanabria Lake was a pioneer in this.

===Climate===
Castile and León has a continental Mediterranean climate, with long, cold winters, with average temperatures between 3 and 6&nbsp;°C in January and short, hot summers (average 19 to 22&nbsp;°C), but with the three or four months of summer aridity characteristic of the Mediterranean climate. Rainfall, with an average of 450–500&nbsp;mm per year, is scarce, accentuating in the lower lands.

;Climatic factors
[[File:Niebla DSCN4966 (34069299364).jpg|thumb|30 December 2016 in Salamanca. Radiation fog episodes and frosts are common in the region throughout [[Anticyclone|anticyclonic]] configurations in Winter.<ref>{{Cite journal|page=160|title=Riesgos climáticos en Castilla y León: análisis de su peligrosidad|first1=Carlos G.|last1=Morales Rodríguez|issn=0212-9426|first2=María Teresa|last2=Villazán|journal=Boletín de la Asociación de Geógrafos Españoles|issue=30|year=2000|url=https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/1122918.pdf}}</ref>]]
In Castile and León the [[cold]] extends almost continuously for much of the year, being a very characteristic element of its [[climate]]. The coldest periods of winter are associated with invasions of a continental [[polar front]] and strata of marine arctic air, rare is that they do not reach temperatures of the order of -5 ° to -10&nbsp;°C. Likewise, in situations of [[anticyclone]], in the interior of the region they cause persistent fogs, creating prolonged cold situations due to radiation processes. The intense "cold waves" of the winter central months are typical, showing a particular tendency to occur from the second fortnight of December to the first of February. During its course the most extreme minimum temperatures occur, whose values vary between -10 ° and -13&nbsp;°C of its westernmost sector and -15 ° and -20&nbsp;°C of the central plains and high moorlands. The lowest recorded records reach -22&nbsp;°C of [[Burgos]], -21.9&nbsp;°C in [[Coca, Segovia|Coca]] (Segovia), -20.4&nbsp;°C in [[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]], -20&nbsp;°C in [[Salamanca]] and -19.2&nbsp;°C in [[Soria]]. The high altitude of the [[Meseta Central|Meseta]] and its mountains accentuates the contrast between winter and summer temperatures, as well as day and night temperatures.<ref name="RCLIM">{{cite web |title=Riesgos climáticos en Castilla y León.

Maritime winds are stopped by the mountainous barriers that surround Castile and León, stopping also the precipitations and causing the rains to fall very unequally in the Castilian and Leonese territory. While in the middle of the Douro basin there is an annual average of 450&nbsp;mm, in the western regions of the mountains of León, the [[Cantabrian Mountains]] and the southern area of the provinces of Ávila and Salamanca, rainfall reaches 1500&nbsp;mm per year, with a maximum of 3400&nbsp;mm per year in the western part of the [[Sierra de Gredos]], in the Candelario-Bejar Massif, which makes this area the rainiest not only from Spain, but from the Iberian Peninsula.<ref>http://www.divulgameteo.es/fotos/meteoroteca/Monta%C3%B1as-clima-LGP.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105094545/http://www.divulgameteo.es/fotos/meteoroteca/Monta%C3%B1as-clima-LGP.pdf |date=5 November 2016 }} L.

; Climatic regions
Although Castile and León is framed within the continental climate, in its lands different climate domains are distinguished:<ref name="ACLIM">{{cite web |title=Atlas climático ibérico |url=http://www.aemet.es/documentos/es/conocermas/publicaciones/Atlas-climatologico/Atlas.pdf |author=AEMET |access-date=8 January 2018 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181337/http://www.aemet.es/documentos/es/conocermas/publicaciones/Atlas-climatologico/Atlas.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>
*According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], a large part of the autonomous community falls within the Csb or Cfb variants, with the average of the warmest month below 22&nbsp;°C but above 10&nbsp;°C for five or more months.
*In several areas of the Meseta Central the climate is classified as Csa ([[Köppen climate classification#Mediterranean climates|warm Mediterranean]]{{Broken anchor|date=2024-05-29|bot=User:Cewbot/log/20201008/configuration|target_link=Köppen climate classification#Mediterranean climates|reason= The anchor (Mediterranean climates) [[Special:Diff/883418768|has been deleted]].}}), by exceeding 22&nbsp;°C during the summer.
*In high elevations of the Cantabrian Mountains and mountain areas, there is a [[Köppen climate classification|cold temperate climate]] with average temperatures under 3&nbsp;°C in the coldest months and dry summers (Dsb or Dsc).

===Nature===
====Flora====
[[File:Raices de tejo en el hayedo otoñal. La Cotorra de Escobaño. Oseja de Sajambre (León). Parque Nacional Picos de Europa. ES000003. ROSUROB.JPG|thumb|right| [[Canal de Asotín|Canal de Asotín Beech]], a [[Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe|UNESCO World Heritage Natural Site]].]]
Castile and León has many protected [[natural landscapes|natural sites]]. Actively collaborates with the [[European Union]] program ''[[Natura 2000]]''. There are also some [[Special Protection Area|special protection area for birds]] or SPA.
The solitary [[Quercus ilex|evergreen oak]]s and [[juniper]]s (''Juniperus sect. Sabina'') that now draw the Castilian-Leonese plain are remnants of the [[forest]]s that covered these same lands long ago. The agricultural holdings, due to the need of land for the cultivation of cereal and pastures for the immense herds of the Castilian Plateau, supposed the [[deforestation]] of these lands during the [[Middle Ages]]. The last Castilian and Leonese forests of junipers are found in the provinces of León, Soria and Burgos. They are not very leafy forests that can form mixed communities with evergreen oaks, [[Portuguese oak]]s or [[pine]]s.

[[File:Hoces del Duratón.jpg|thumb|left| [[Hoces del Río Duratón Natural Park]]]]
The Castilian-Leonese slope of the Cantabrian Mountains and the northern foothills of the [[Sistema Ibérico]] have a rich vegetation. The most humid and fresh slopes are populated by large [[beech]]es, whose extension areas can reach 1,500 m altitude. In turn, the [[Fagus sylvatica|European beech]] forms mixed forests with the [[Taxus baccata|yew]], the [[sorbus]], the [[Sorbus aria|whitebeam]], the [[Ilex aquifolium|European holly]] and the [[birch]]. On the sunny slopes the [[Quercus petraea|sessile oak]], the [[Quercus robur|European oak]], the [[Fraxinus|ash]], the [[Tilia|lime tree]], the [[Castanea sativa|sweet chestnut]], the [[birch]] and the [[scots pine]] (a typical species from the north of the province of León).

====Fauna====
[[File:Arribesdeldueropozo.jpg|thumb| [[Arribes del Duero Natural Park]], which is a [[Special Protection Area|special protection area for birds]].]]
Castile and León presents a great diversity of fauna. There are numerous species and some of them are of special interest because of their uniqueness, such as some endemic species, or because of their scarcity, such as the [[brown bear]]. There have been counted 418 species of vertebrates, which make up 63% of all vertebrates that live in Spain. Animals adapted to life in the high mountains, inhabitants of rocky places, inhabitants of fluvial courses, species of plains and forest residents form the mosaic of the Castilian-Leonese fauna.

The isolation to which the high summits are subject leads to the existence of abundant endemisms such as the [[Spanish ibex]], which in Gredos constitutes a unique subspecies in the Peninsula. The [[European snow vole]] is a graceful small [[mammal]] of grayish brown color and long tail that lives in open spaces over the limit of the trees.

Small and large mammals such as [[squirrel]], [[dormouse]], [[Talpidae|talpids]], [[European pine marten]], [[Beech marten]], [[fox]], [[wildcat]], [[wolf]], quite abundant in some areas, [[boar]], [[deer]], [[roe deer]] and, only in the Cantabrian Mountains, some specimens of [[brown bear]] tend to frequent the deciduous forests, although some species also extend to coniferous forests and scrubland. The wildcat is slightly larger than a domestic cat, has a short and stout tail, with dark rings and striped fur. The [[Iberian lynx]], however, lives almost exclusively in areas of Mediterranean scrubland.
[[File:Canis lupus signatus (Kerkrade Zoo) 02.jpg|thumb|left|Castile and León is the main habitat of the [[Iberian wolf]]. The naturalist [[Félix Rodríguez de la Fuente]] promoted the protection of the species.]]

Small reptiles such as the [[ladder snake]], the [[coronella girondica]] and the [[aesculapian snake]] are also found in this environment. The [[Coronella austriaca|smooth snake]] can be found from sea level to 1,800 m in height and in the community it tends to live on the heights. Further up, in the rocky areas of the subalpine floor at about 2,400 m altitude the [[Iberian rock lizard]] lives, one of the few reptiles adapted at this point.

In the mountain rivers live the [[otter]] and [[desman]] and in its waters the [[trout]], [[anguillidae]], the [[common minnow]]s and some of the increasingly scarce autochthonous river crabs. The otter and the desman are two mammals with aquatic habits and very good swimmers. The [[otter]] feeds mainly on fish, while the desman seeks its food among the aquatic invertebrates that inhabit the riverbed. In lower sections of calmer waters swim [[barbel (fish)|barbel]] s and [[carps]]. Among the amphibians, the [[salamander]]s and as remarkable species: the [[Salamandra salamandra almanzoris|Almanzor salamander]] (''Salamandra salamandra almanzoris'') and the [[Bufo bufo gredosicola|Gredos toad]] (''Bufo bufo gredosicola''), which are two endemic subspecies to the Sistema Central.

Where the rivers are encased forming sickles and canyons, rock-dwelling birds such as [[griffon vulture]], [[cinereous vulture]], [[Egyptian vulture]], [[golden eagle]] or [[peregrine falcon]]. The Egyptian vulture, a small vulture, is black and white with a yellow head. Downstream and on its banks between the lush vegetation form their colonies the [[black-crowned night heron]] and the [[grey heron]] and the [[goldcrest]], the [[eurasian penduline tit]], the [[eurasian hoopoe]] and the [[common kingfisher]].
[[File:Spanish Ibex Portrait.jpg|thumb| [[Western Spanish ibex]], also called Gredos ibex ''(Capra pyrenaica victoriae)'', [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] to [[Sierra de Gredos]].]]

Among the birds that populate the open Mediterranean forests live two endangered species: the [[black stork]] and the [[Spanish imperial eagle]]. The black stork, much rarer than its congener the [[white stork]], is of solitary habits and lives far from man. The Spanish imperial eagle nests in the trees and feeds mainly on rabbits, but also birds, reptiles and carrion.

In the coniferous forests live among others the [[short-toed treecreeper]], the [[coal tit]] and the [[eurasian nuthatch]], a bird of gray back and flanks reddish-orange that it nests in holes to which it narrows the entrance with mud. The [[western capercaillie]] is a very dark and large rooster that lives in forest environments, so it is very difficult to observe. Among the forest raptors are the [[accipiter]], the [[eurasian sparrowhawk]] or the [[tawny owl]], which frequently attack other smaller birds such as [[eurasian jay]], [[iberian green woodpecker]], [[fringilla]], [[great spotted woodpecker]] and [[typical warbler]].

The [[bustard]] frequents the open plains with rain-fed crops; It is large and has a grayish head and neck and a brown back. In the Castilian-Leonese wetlands during the winter many specimens of [[greylag goose]], which breeds in northern Europe and visits the area in winter, are concentrated.

The naturalist [[Félix Rodríguez de la Fuente]] (1928 – 1980), natural from [[Poza de la Sal]], stands out in the scientific study and its dissemination. He had a great research and made the leap to fame with the television series ''[[El hombre y la Tierra]]'' ([[Televisión Española|TVE]]).

With 2&nbsp;528&nbsp;417&nbsp;inhabitants (1 January 2007), 1&nbsp;251&nbsp;082 men and 1&nbsp;277&nbsp;335 women, the population of Castile and León represents 5.69% of the population of [[Spain]], although its vast territory covers almost a fifth of the total area of the country. In January 2005, the population of Castile and León was divided, by province, as follows: [[Province of Ávila]], 168&nbsp;638&nbsp;inhabitants; [[Province of Burgos]], 365&nbsp;972; [[Province of León]], 497&nbsp;387; [[Province of Palencia]], 173&nbsp;281; [[Province of Salamanca]], 351&nbsp;326; [[Province of Segovia]], 159&nbsp;322; [[Province of Soria]], 93&nbsp;593; [[Province of Valladolid]], 521&nbsp;661; and [[Province of Zamora]], 197&nbsp;237.

The autonomous community has a very low population density, around 26.57&nbsp;inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>, a record that is more than three times lower than the national average, which indicates that it is a sparsely populated and demographically decline, especially in rural areas and even in small traditional cities. The demographic characteristics of the territory show an aging population, with a low birth rate and mortality that approaches the state average.

In the year 2000, the population of Castile and León totaled 2&nbsp;479&nbsp;118 people, that is, 6.12% of the Spanish total. Its natural growth was one of the lowest in Spain: -7223 (-2.92 gross rate), as a result of the difference between the 25&nbsp;080 deaths (10.12 of the gross rate) and the 17&nbsp;857 births ( 7.20 gross rate). The number of inhabitants in 1999 was slightly higher (2&nbsp;488&nbsp;062), so that, despite the negative growth, the relative numerical stability is partly due to the increase in [[immigration]]: of 22&nbsp;910 immigrants in 1999 it went to 24&nbsp;340 in 2000. In that year, 59 children under the age of one year died.

The [[life expectancy]] is higher than the Spanish average: 83.24 for women and 78.30 for men, a superiority that in 1999 was repeated in the register, since women added 1&nbsp;260&nbsp;906 and the males 1&nbsp;227&nbsp;156. A study by the University of Porto (Portugal) cites Castile and León as one of the European regions where old people could expect to live longer.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Ribeiro |first1=Ana Isabel |last2=Krainski |first2=Elias Teixeira |last3=Carvalho |first3=Marilia Sá |last4=Pina |first4=Maria de Fátima de |date=15 February 2016 |title=Where do people live longer and shorter lives?

In 1999, the age distribution gave the following results: 317&nbsp;783 people from 0 to 14 years old; 913&nbsp;618 between 15 and 39 years old; 576&nbsp;183 from 40 to 59 years and 677&nbsp;020 over 60 years.

The active population in 2001 was 1&nbsp;005&nbsp;200 and occupied 884&nbsp;200 people, with which the unemployment was 12.1% of the active population. For sectors of the employed population, 10.9% worked in [[agriculture]], 20.6% in the [[Industrial sector|industry]], 12.7% in construction, and 63,1% in the services sector.

===Historical evolution===
[[File:Homenaje a la Mujer.jpg|thumb| [[Calle Mayor, Palencia|Calle Mayor]] street of [[Palencia]]. The city is within the most dynamic axis of the community.]]
Many of the people of the territory, who devoted themselves mostly to [[agriculture]] and [[livestock]], gradually abandoned the area, heading towards urban areas, much more prosperous. This situation was further aggravated at the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]], with a progressive rural emigration. During the 1960s and 1980s, large urban centers and provincial capitals suffered a slight demographic increase due to a thorough urbanization process, although, despite this, the Castilian-Leonese area continues to suffer serious depopulation. Only the provinces of [[province of Burgos|Burgos]], [[province of Valladolid|Valladolid]] and [[province of Segovia|Segovia]] are gaining population in recent years.

There is also an increase in the population of metropolitan areas around cities such as [[Valladolid]], [[Burgos]] or [[León, Spain|León]]. Due to this phenomenon, cities such as [[Laguna de Duero]] or [[San Andrés del Rabanedo]] have seen their population increase rapidly in a few years. The metropolitan area of the city of Valladolid is, by far, the largest in the autonomous community, with more than 430&nbsp;000&nbsp;inhabitants.

However, in absolute terms the autonomous community is losing population and aging. In 2011, it was one of only four [[Autonomous Community|autonomous communities]] that lost population along with [[Asturias]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Aragon]].

===Present-day population distribution===
{{See also|List of municipalities in Castile and León}}
In 1960 the urban population meant 20.6% of the total population of Castile and León; in 1991 this percentage had risen to 42.3% and in 1998 it was approaching 43%, which indicates the progressive rural depopulation. The phenomenon is also reflected in the number of municipalities with less than 100 inhabitants, which was multiplied by seven between 1960 and 1986. Outside the provincial capitals, the largest towns are [[Miranda de Ebro]] and [[Aranda de Duero]] in the province of Burgos, [[Ponferrada]] and [[San Andrés del Rabanedo]] in the province of León, [[Béjar]] in the province of Salamanca and [[Medina del Campo]] and [[Laguna de Duero]] in the province of Valladolid.

Of the 2248 municipalities of this community, the 2014 registry registered 1986 with less than 1000 inhabitants; 204 from 1001 to 5000; 35 from 5001 to 10&nbsp;000; 8 of 10&nbsp;001 to 20&nbsp;000; 6 of 20&nbsp;001 to 50&nbsp;000; 5 of 50&nbsp;001 to 100&nbsp;000 and 4 municipalities with more than 100&nbsp;000 inhabitants. The latter are: Valladolid (306&nbsp;830&nbsp;hab.), Burgos (177&nbsp;776&nbsp;hab.), Salamanca (148&nbsp;042&nbsp;hab.) And León (129&nbsp;551&nbsp;hab.) Among the least populated are, between others: [[Jaramillo Quemado]] (Burgos), with 4&nbsp;inhabitants, [[Estepa de San Juan]] (Soria), with 7, [[Quiñonería]] (Soria), with 8 and [[Villanueva de Gormaz]] (Soria), with 9.

[[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] is the predominant religion in the community. According to the barometer of the [[Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas]] (CIS) conducted in October 2019, 76.8% of Castilian-Leonese are considered Catholics (43.2 Non-Practising and 33.6% Practising), and [[Irreligion|non-believers]] 20.3%.

Actual attendance at a church is on average less than these figures show. According to the same study, only half of self identifying Catholics go to mass regularly with those considered "practicing" Catholics attending more regularly than those considered "non practicing".<ref name="CIS"/>

==Languages==

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the only official and preponderant language throughout the territory. The phenomena of ''[[leísmo]]'' and ''[[laísmo]]'' are considered to be deviations characteristic of the varieties of Spanish spoken in the region, later irradiating to other territories.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://e-spacio.uned.es/fez/eserv.php?pid=bibliuned:Epos-84315660-E424-6903-3967-69ABCF73AC97&dsID=Documento.pdf|issue=1|journal=Epos|page=169|title=Datos sobre el leísmo y laísmo de persona en el habla de la ciudad de Burgos|first=Miguel|last=Martínez Martín|year=1984|doi=10.5944/epos.1.1984.9408|publisher=[[Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia]]|location=Madrid|doi-broken-date=2024-11-03}}</ref>

In addition to Spanish (also referred to in the Spanish-speaking world as {{lang|es|castellano}}; {{translation|'Castilian'}}), other languages or linguistic varieties are spoken in small areas of Castile and León: the [[Leonese language]], that "will be subject to specific protection [...] because of its particular value within the Community's linguistic heritage" and [[Galician language]], which, according to the Statute of Autonomy, "will enjoy respect and protection in the places where it is usually used" (fundamentally, in the border areas with Galicia of the comarcas of [[El Bierzo]] and [[Sanabria (comarca)|Sanabria]]).

==Administration and politics==

===Territorial organization===
The community is the sum of nine provinces: [[Province of Ávila]], [[Province of Burgos]], [[Province of León]], [[Province of Palencia]], [[Province of Salamanca]], [[Province of Segovia]], [[Province of Soria]], [[Province of Valladolid]] and [[Province of Zamora]]. The provincial capitals fall in the homonymous cities to their corresponding provinces.

The concurrence of some peculiar geographical, social, historical and economic characteristics is legally recognized for [[El Bierzo]] (an area that was a province on its own in the [[1822 territorial division of Spain|project of initial provincial division]], though it disappeared in the [[1833 territorial division of Spain]]), and the [[Comarcas of Spain|comarca]] of ''El Bierzo'' was created in 1991, with its center in [[Ponferrada]].<ref>LAW 1/1991 of 14 March, by which is created and regulates the region of El Bierzo. Date of the B.O.C.Y.L .: 20 March 1991 No. Bulletin: 55/1991</ref> It is the only Castilian-Leonese territory recognized by law outside the normal provincial division, and it is administered by a Comarcal Council. Castile and León also includes the [[exclave of Treviño]], surrounded by the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] [[Álava|province of Araba/Álava]].

====Provision of services====
[[File:Borrador de UBOST CyL (2015).svg|thumb|Draft of UBOST presented in September 2015.]]

The new territorial arrangement approved by Law 7/2013, on Planning, Services and Government of the Territory of the Community of Castile and León, establishes that the geographical spaces delimited for the provision of services are the [[Basic unit of territorial planning and services (Castile and León)|basic unit of territorial planning and services (UBOST)]] -urban or rural- and functional areas -[[Stable functional area (Castile and León)|stable]] or strategic-.<ref>{{citation |url=http://bocyl.jcyl.es/boletines/2013/10/01/pdf/BOCYL-D-01102013-2.pdf |title=Ley 7/2013, de 27 de septiembre, de Ordenación, Servicios y Gobierno del Territorio de la Comunidad de Castilla y León |work=[[Boletín Oficial de Castilla y León]] num. 189, of 1 October 2013 |publisher=[[Castile and León Regional Government|Junta de Castilla y León]] |pages=65222–65273 |issn=1989-8959 |access-date=10 January 2018 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304222455/http://bocyl.jcyl.es/boletines/2013/10/01/pdf/BOCYL-D-01102013-2.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Also, the new ordination determines that the [[Mancommunity of common interest (Castile and León)|mancommunities of common interest]] are entities for the fulfillment of their specific purposes, which may be declared when their territorial scope substantially agrees with an UBOST or several contiguous ones.<ref>{{Cite web |title=DISPOSICIÓN EN HTML BOCYL-D-04052015-1&#124; BOLETÍN OFICIAL DE CASTILLA Y LEÓN |url=https://bocyl.jcyl.es/html/2015/05/04/html/BOCYL-D-04052015-1.do |access-date=2021-11-22 |website=bocyl.jcyl.es |archive-date=22 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211122181952/https://bocyl.jcyl.es/html/2015/05/04/html/BOCYL-D-04052015-1.do |url-status=live }}</ref>

This ordination is still in the implementation phase, and in September 2015 the draft map dividing the autonomous community was presented in 147 rural UBOST and 15 urban UBOST.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comunicacion.jcyl.es/web/jcyl/Comunicacion/es/Plantilla100Detalle/1281372051501/_/1284483465801/Comunicacion |title=La Junta presenta el primer borrador de unidades básicas de ordenación del territorio, abierto a aportaciones previas a la propuesta inicial para su tramitación |first=Junta de Castilla y |last=León |website=www.comunicacion.jcyl.es |access-date=21 January 2018 |archive-date=11 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111052723/http://comunicacion.jcyl.es/web/jcyl/Comunicacion/es/Plantilla100Detalle/1281372051501/_/1284483465801/Comunicacion |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Autonomous institutions===
[[File:Burgos - Palacio de Justicia 1.jpg|thumb| [[Palacio de Justicia, Valladolid|Palacio de Justicia]], seat of the Upper Court of Justice of Castile and León, in Burgos.]]
The Statute of Autonomy does not explicitly establish one [[Capital of Castile and León|capital]]. Initially the [[Cortes of Castile and León|Cortes]] were installed provisionally in [[Burgos]]; the possibility of fixing a capital in [[Tordesillas]] was also discussed, although the final decision was to install the [[Cortes of Castile and León|Cortes]] provisionally in the [[castle of Fuensaldaña]].

Finally, through the autonomous laws 13/1987 and 14/1987, approved simultaneously, it was decided respectively to establish that the [[Castile and León Regional Government|Junta de Castilla y León]] -the government of the Community-, its president, and the [[Cortes of Castile and León|Cortes]] -the legislative body- had its headquarters in the city of [[Valladolid]]; and that the [[Upper Court of Justice of Castile and León]] had its headquarters in [[Burgos]]. The main autonomous institutions are the following:
*[[Castile and León Regional Government|Junta de Castilla y León]] (Regional Government of Castile and León), with headquarters in Valladolid, is the regional executive, formed by the [[President of the Junta of Castile and León|President of the Regional Government]], the vice presidents and the councilors
*[[Cortes of Castile and León|Cortes de Castilla y León]] (Parliament of Castile and León), based in Valladolid
*[[Upper Court of Justice of Castile and León|Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Castilla y León]] (Upper Court of Justice of Castile and León), based in Burgos

===Cortes of Castile and León===
During the first legislature, the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] was the party with the most representation in Cortes, being the first president of the community the Socialist [[Demetrio Madrid]]. Since the 1990s, regional policy has been framed by a series of absolute majorities of the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]], which continues to comfortably govern at present. Other national parties with presence in the community, either locally or regionally, are [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]] (previously as [[Communist Party of Spain]]) and [[Union, Progress and Democracy]], with a significant presence in the provinces of [[province of Ávila|Ávila]] and [[province of Burgos|Burgos]]. Previously [[Democratic and Social Centre (Spain)|Democratic and Social Centre]] of [[Adolfo Suárez]] also managed to be in the regional political life occupying the reformist center of the political spectrum.

The Leonesism through the [[Leonese People's Union]], the Castilianism through [[Castilian Party|Party of Castile and León]], previously [[Commoners' Land]] or localistas parties like [[Independent Solution (Spain)|Independent Solution]], [[Group of Zamoran Independent Electoral Members]] or [[Initiative for the Development of Soria]] have also had their presence, although at a lower level.

The community is governed by [[Alfonso Fernández Mañueco]], of the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]]. This party obtained 29 [[Procurator in Cortes|procurators]] in the [[2019 Castilian-Leonese regional election]]. Mañueco's investiture was supported by the party [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Citizens]], with 12 representatives. The party that obtained the most seats at the election, the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] is in opposition, with 35 representatives. The leader of the opposition is [[Luis Tudanca]]. In addition, four more formations obtained parliamentary representation in the region: [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] (2 seats), [[Vox (political party)|Vox]] (1), [[For Ávila|XÁvila]] (1) and [[Leonese People's Union]] (1).

A 2024 law passed by the regional Castile and León coalition (including Vox and the People's Party) omitted any mention of General Franco as a dictator, which sparked criticism.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date= |title= Right-wing parties 'whitewash' Spain's fascist past with law erasing Franco dictatorship|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/03/30/spain-vox-castilla-y-leon-franco-new-law-fascism/ |work= |location= |access-date=}}</ref>

===Human Rights in Castile and León===
[[File:ValladolidPride2024.jpg|thumb|[[Valladolid]] LGBTQ+ Pride 2024.]]
The roots of modern Human Rights theories has its origins in Castile and León. The [[School of Salamanca]] was an intellectual movement of 16th-century where humanism raised, being its major contributor [[Francisco de Vitoria]].

The [[Valladolid debate]] was the first moral debate in European history to discuss the rights and treatment of Indigenous people by European colonizers.

Castile and León is the only autonomous region in Spain withouth a specific regional law protecting LGBTQ+ citizens.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.diariodecastillayleon.es/castilla-y-leon/240628/52248/blanco-descarta-ley-lgbti-castilla-leon-espera-ver-evoluciona-consolida-norma-nacional.html | title=La Junta descarta una ley LGTBI en Castilla y León | date=28 June 2024 }}</ref> Several LGBTQ+ organizations exists in the region, such as Segovia Entiende,<ref>https://segovia.es/area/participacion-ciudadana-transparencia-y-gobierno-abierto/entidades/asociacion-segoentiende</ref> Espacio Seguro LGBTQ+ Burgos,<ref>https://espacioseguroburgos.org/</ref> Chiguitxs LGTB+ Palencia,<ref>https://www.facebook.com/chiguitxslgtb/?locale=es_ES</ref> Arco Ávila,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.instagram.com/arcoavilalgtbiq/?hl=es | title=Instagram }}</ref> Awen León<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.instagram.com/awenlgtbileon/?hl=es | title=Instagram }}</ref> or Fundación Triangulo Castilla y León.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/fundaciontriangulocyl/?locale=es_ES</ref>

===Primary sector===
[[File:Villarejo de Orbigo1 Leon Spain.jpg|thumb| [[Villarejo de Órbigo]], typical rural town of the [[Ribera del Órbigo]] and of [[Tierra de Campos]] comarcas.]]

;Field
The fields of Castile and Leon are arid and dry although very fertile, predominating in them the [[dryland farming]]. Despite this, irrigation has been gaining importance in the areas of the valleys of [[Douro]], [[Esla (river)|Esla]], [[Órbigo]], [[Pisuerga]] and [[Tormes]]. The scarce orography and the improvement of communications has favored the entry of technical innovations throughout the process of agricultural production, especially in areas such as the [[province of Valladolid]] or the [[province of Burgos]] where the production per hectare is one of the highest in Spain. The most fertile Castilian-Leonese area coincides with the Esla valley, in León, in the fields of [[Valladolid]] and [[Tierra de Campos]], a district that extends between [[province of Zamora]], [[province of Valladolid]], [[province of Palencia]] and [[province of León]].

;Use of arable land
[[File:Arco, castillo de Gormaz, Soria.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Meseta Central]] is a large plateau ranging a considerable part of the region of [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]]. In the image a landscape of the Meseta Central viewed from the [[castle of Gormaz]].]]
Castile and León has an agricultural area close to 5,783,831 hectares, which is more than half of the total area of its total territory. Most of the farmland is dryland, due to the climate and the low rainfall. Only 10% of the area is irrigated, with plots of intensive production, much more profitable than dryland crops.

Despite the decline of the population in rural areas, the Castilian-Leonese agricultural production still represents 15% of the Spanish primary sector and its average occupation is lower than that of other autonomous communities.

;Types of crop
[[File:Vinos DO de Castilla y León.svg|thumb|230px|Wines with [[denominación de origen]] of Castile and León]]
Castile and León constitutes one of the main Spanish cereal areas. As the popular saying says: "''Castile, granary of Spain''". Although the most traditional crop was wheat, the production of barley has gained ground since the 1960s. These two cereals are followed, in number of hectares cultivated and volume of production, rye and oats. In addition to legumes, such as carob and chickpeas, sunflower cultivation has spread in the southern countryside.

The vineyard (56,337 ha) saw the number of hectares cultivated during the last three decades of the 20th century decrease considerably; However, the application of the most modern aging techniques has notably improved the Castilian-Leonese wines, which compete in quality with those of La Rioja and begin to be known outside the Spanish borders. The main viticultural areas of the region are [[Ribera del Duero|Ribera del Duero (DO)]], [[Rueda (DO)]], [[Toro (DO)]], [[Bierzo (DO)]], [[Arribes (wine)|Arribes (DO)]] and [[Tierra de León (DO)]]. Irrigated land is planted with sugar beet, a product that has been subsidized by the regional authorities, potatoes, alfalfa and vegetables. In the province of León, corn, hops and legumes are also sown.

;Livestock
[[File:051127 1327 Villalba de los Llanos - Vaca morucha T01.JPG|thumb|left| [[Morucha]] cow in a [[dehesa]] of [[Campo Charro]], place of production of [[Jamón de Guijuelo]].]]
Livestock represents an important part of the final agricultural production. Next to the small livestock units, which proliferate in the regions of pre-eminent agricultural dedication or in the mountain areas, now appears a modern livestock activity, with cattle, pig and sheep farms, of development. These farms are oriented both to the production of meat and to the supply of milk to the cooperatives that channel their subsequent commercialization, since the dairy production of Castile and León -more than one and a half million liters per year- is the second largest in Spain, only surpassed by Galicia.

Thus, small livestock farms tend to disappear, largely due to the effect of rural depopulation and the consequent loss of labor. Transhumant grazing is conserved in some areas; large herds, mainly sheep, travel every year hundreds of kilometers from the flat lands to the land with mountain pastures as in the [[El Bierzo]], the Cantabrian valleys of province of León, the [[sierra de Gredos]] or Picos de Urbión. It is hard work that every time has less labor, having previously constituted a testimony of first importance on the history and cultural roots of the Castilian and Leonese people.
[[File:Pinar de Valsaín.jpg|thumb|Pines in [[Valle de Valsaín]].]]
The sheep herd is the most numerous, with 5,425,000 heads, followed by domestic pig (2,800,000) and cattle (1,200,000). A long way away is the goats (166,200 heads) and horses (71,700 horses, mules and donkeys). The highest production of meat corresponds to that of pigs (241,700 t), followed by bovine (89,400 t) and poultry (66,000 t); in wool production Castile and León leads the national balance with 7,500 t. Within the section of Protected [[Geographical indication]] (I.G.P), highlights [[Lechazo de Castilla y León (I.G.P.)|Lechazo de Castilla y León]], based in [[Aranda de Duero]].

;Forest exploitation
In Castile and León there are about 1,900,000 hectares of non-arboreal, representing 40% of the total forest area. This deforestation is mainly due to the hand of the man who, over the centuries, has made forests disappear, giving way to areas of non-arboreal vegetation. Little by little, with the abandonment of rural areas and the reforestation policy of the Castilian and Leonese governments, this situation has been reversed.

===Secondary sector===
;Industry
[[File:Factoría de Renault en Valladolid. Junta de Castilla y León. 2018.jpg|thumb|right| [[Renault]] factory in Valladolid]]
[[File:(Aeroengines Ircio de Aciturri) Visita a Aciturri y Montefibre (Miranda de Ebro) 02.jpg|thumb|right|Aciturri Aeroengines plant in Miranda de Ebro]]
During 2000, the Castile and León industry occupied 18% of the active population and contributed 25% of GDP. The most developed industrial axis is that of [[Valladolid]]-[[Palencia]]-[[Burgos]]-[[Miranda de Ebro]]-[[Aranda de Duero]], where there is an important car industry, paper industry, aeronautics and chemistry, and is where most of the industrial activity of the Castilian-Leonese territory is concentrated. The food industry derived from the farm and livestock, with flour, sunflower oil and wines, among others is also important, especially in the [[Ribera del Duero (comarca)|Ribera del Duero]] comarca, especially in [[Aranda de Duero]].

The main industrial poles of the community are: [[Valladolid]] (21,054 workers dedicated to the sector), [[Burgos]] (20,217), [[Aranda de Duero]] (4,872), [[León, Spain|León]] (4,521), [[Ponferrada]] (4,270) and [[Ólvega]] (4,075).<ref>{{cite web |title=Fichas Municipales - 2008 DATOS ECONÓMICOS Y SOCIALES |url=http://www.cajaespana.es/pubweb/decyle.nsf |date=2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222182606/http://www.cajaespana.es/pubweb/decyle.nsf |archive-date=22 December 2009}}</ref>

Other industries are textiles in [[Béjar]], roof tiles and bricks in [[Palencia]], sugar in [[León, Spain|León]], [[Valladolid]], [[Toro, Zamora|Toro]], [[Miranda de Ebro]] and [[Benavente, Zamora|Benavente]], the pharmaceutical company in [[León, Spain|León]], [[Valladolid]] and mainly in [[Aranda de Duero]] with a factory of the [[GlaxoSmithKline]] group, the metallurgical and steel company in [[Ponferrada]] and the chemistry in [[Miranda de Ebro]] and [[Valladolid]], the aeronautics in [[Miranda de Ebro]] and [[Valladolid]]. In the remaining capitals there is a [[food industry]] derived from the agricultural and livestock exploitation, with flour, sunflower oil and wines, among others. This regional [[food industry|agro-food industry]] is flagged by [[Calidad Pascual]] based in [[Aranda de Duero]]. In the [[agricultural]] industry, within the production of [[fertilizer]]s, the [[Mirat]], founded in 1812 in [[Salamanca]], stands out.<ref>{{citation |title=Las 5000 mayores empresas |year=2009 |work=Castilla y León Económica |number=153}}</ref>

In [[Soria]] the [[logging|logging industry]] and furniture manufacturing is also relevant to the regional economy.

The president of the Castilian-Leonese employers' association is currently [[Ginés Clemente]], owner of the [[Aciturri Aeronáutica]], based in [[Miranda de Ebro]]. It is a leading international aeronautical group, with contracts with groups such as [[Boeing]] and [[Airbus]], which makes Castile and León a benchmark in the sector.

;Construction
The 16,34% of the companies in Castile and León belong to the auxiliary sector of [[construction]]. Among the largest companies in the sector, the following stand out: [[Grupo Pantersa]], [[Begar (corporation)|Begar]], [[Grupo MRS]], [[Isolux Corsán]], [[Llorente Corporation]], [[Volconsa]] and of auxiliary construction sector, [[Artepref]] of [[Gerardo de la Calle Group]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Ranking 2009 de las 5.000 mayores empresas de Castilla y León - year <nowiki>=</nowiki> 2010 |url=http://www.castillayleoneconomica.es/ranking.html |date=2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831105824/http://www.castillayleoneconomica.es/ranking.html |archive-date=31 August 2010}}</ref>

;Mining
[[File:Mina de pizarra a cielo abierto en la provincia de León. Junta de Castilla y León. 2000.jpg|thumb|Open-cast slate quarry in the province of León.]]
In Castile and León, the mining activity acquired great importance in the Roman times, when a road was drawn, the [[Vía de la Plata]], to transfer the gold extracted in the deposits of [[Las Médulas]], in the Leonese comarca of [[El Bierzo]], the route started from [[Asturica Augusta]] (Astorga) to [[Emerita Augusta]] (Mérida) and [[Hispalis]] (Seville).

Centuries later, after the [[Spanish Civil War]], mining was one of the factors that contributed to the economic development of the region. However, the production of iron, tin and tungsten decreased notably from the 1970s, while bituminous coal and anthracite mines were maintained thanks to the domestic demand for coal for thermal power plants. The economic reconversion that affected the [[Leonese mining basin]] and [[Palencia mining basin|Palencian mining basin]] during the 1980s and 1990s resulted in the closure of numerous mines, social impoverishment, with a sharp increase of unemployment and the beginning of a new migratory movement towards other Spanish regions. Despite the investments of the Mining Action Plan of the Junta de Castilla y León, traditional coal mining operations have entered into a severe crisis.

Castile and León is a net producer of electric energy, with a generation/demand ratio in 2021 of 197% (27,016 GWh vs. 13,670 GWh).<ref>{{Cite web|first=José|last=Rodríguez Sojo|title=El mapa de la electricidad en España: ¿qué comunidades producen más energía y cuáles son las mayores consumidoras?|url=https://cadenaser.com/nacional/2022/08/05/el-mapa-de-la-electricidad-en-espana-que-comunidades-producen-mas-energia-y-cuales-son-las-mayores-consumidoras-cadena-ser/|website=[[Cadena SER]]|date=5 August 2022}}</ref>

In addition to the northern basin, in those of the Douro and Ebro rivers there are numerous hydroelectric plants that allow Castile and León to be one of the first autonomous communities producing electricity. Among others are those of Burguillo, Rioscuro, Las Ondinas, Cornatel, Bárcena, [[Aldeadávila Dam|Aldeadávila I and II]], [[Saucelle Dam|Saucelle I and II]], [[Castro Dam|Castro I and II]], [[Villalcampo Dam|Villalcampo I and II]], Valparaíso and [[Ricobayo Dam|Ricobayo I and II]].

The total installed hydraulic power amounts to 3,979 MW<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.energiasrenovables.ciemat.es/?pid=4000&id_seccion=8&tipo=noticias&id=1563 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222090915/http://www.energiasrenovables.ciemat.es/?pid=4000&id_seccion=8&tipo=noticias&id=1563 |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 December 2009 |title=La potencia instalada en energías renovables se multiplica por diez en los últimos ocho años |quote=The installed power in 2006 is distributed as follows: 3,979 megawatts in hydraulic, 2,707 in coal and 466 in nuclear}}</ref><ref name=ref_duplicated_1>{{citation |url=http://www.nortecastilla.es/v/20110108/economia/lluvia-megavatios-20110108.html |title=Lluvia de megavatios |work=El Norte de Castilla (newspaper) |year=2011 |quote=Hydraulic production exceeded 5,739 Gwh in the region.

[[File:Avila_001.jpg|thumb|right|The city of Ávila is one of the places in Castile and León declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.]]
Since 1988, the foundation ''[[Las Edades del Hombre]]'' has been organizing various exhibitions of religious art in various parts of the national and international geography, highlighting for its interest the exhibitions held in Castile and León. The idea of carrying out these exhibitions was conceived in a chimney of [[Alcazarén]] with the writer [[José Jiménez Lozano]] and the priest of Valladolid José Velicia. The first "Las Edades del Hombre" were held in the Church of Santiago Apóstol of Alcazarén, with a small exhibition of sacred paintings. Later, and with the support of important personalities, the first known exhibition was held among the public, which was that of Valladolid. In 2012 the initiative was developed under the name of ''Monacatus'' in the town of [[Oña]], being one of the most multitudinous editions with about 200&nbsp;000 visitors.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2012/11/03/castillayleon/1351963961.html |title='Monacatus' echa el cierre con 200.000 visitas y un gran impacto económico |access-date=31 January 2018 |archive-date=1 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201020237/http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2012/11/03/castillayleon/1351963961.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The last sample so far has taken place in the municipality of [[Arévalo]], in 2013.

===Rail===
Castilla y León has an extensive rail network, including the principal lines from [[Madrid]] to [[Cantabria]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. The line from [[Paris]] to [[Lisbon]] crosses the region, reaching the Portuguese frontier at [[Fuentes de Oñoro]] in [[Salamanca]]. [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]], [[Burgos]], [[León, Spain|León]], [[Miranda de Ebro]], [[Palencia]], [[Ponferrada]], [[Medina del Campo]] and [[Valladolid]] are all important railway junctions.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Railways operate in several different gauges: [[Iberian gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1668mm}}), [[UIC gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1435mm}}) and [[Narrow gauge railway|Narrow gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm}}). Except for some narrow-gauge lines, trains are operated by [[Renfe]] on lines maintained by the [[Administrador de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias (Spain)|Administrador de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias]] (ADIF); both of these are national, state-owned companies. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Roads===
The region is also crossed by two major ancient routes:{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
*The Way of St. James, mentioned [[#Tourism|above]] as a World Heritage Site, now a [[hiking trail]] and a motorway, from east to west.
*The Roman Via de la Plata ("Silver Way"), mentioned [[#Mining|above]] in the context of mining, now a main road through the west of the region.

The road network is regulated by the Ley de carreteras 10/2008 de Castilla y León (Highway Law 10/2008 of Castile and León).<ref>Ha entrado en vigor la nueva Ley de carreteras de Castilla y León que regula la planificación, proyección, construcción, conservación, financiación, uso y explotación de las carreteras con itinerario comprendido íntegramente en el territorio de la Comunidad Autónoma de Castilla y León y que no sean de titularidad del Estado.
