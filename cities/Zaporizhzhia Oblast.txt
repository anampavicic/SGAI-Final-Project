'''Zaporizhzhia Oblast''' ({{langx|uk|Запорізька область|translit= Zaporizka oblast|link=no}}), commonly referred to as '''Zaporizhzhia''' ({{langx|uk|Запоріжжя|label=none}}), is an [[oblasts of Ukraine|oblast]] (region) in south-east [[Ukraine]]. Its [[administrative centre]] is [[Zaporizhzhia]]. The oblast covers an area of {{convert|27,183|km2}}, and has a population of {{Ua-pop-est2022|1,638,462|.}}

This oblast is an important part of Ukraine's industry and agriculture. Most of the area of the oblast has been under [[Russian occupation of Zaporizhzhia Oblast|Russian military occupation]] since the 2022 [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]], including all of the coast, although the capital and the majority of the population remains under Ukrainian administration.

On 30 September 2022, Russia declared it had [[Russian annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts|annexed]] the [[Donetsk Oblast|Donetsk]] ([[Donetsk People's Republic]]), [[Luhansk Oblast|Luhansk]] ([[Luhansk People's Republic]]), Zaporizhzhia, and [[Kherson Oblast|Kherson]] oblasts, despite having failed to occupy all of these Ukrainian territories. However, the [[2022 annexation referendums in Russian-occupied Ukraine|disputed referendums]] and subsequent annexations are not internationally recognized.

To the south, Zaporizhzhia Oblast covers roughly {{convert|150|km}} of coastline of the [[Sea of Azov]], as part of a coastal region known as [[Pryazovia]], also including the coastal regions of Kherson Oblast and Donetsk Oblast, to the west and east, respectively.

==Geography==
The area of the oblast is 27,183&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>; its population (estimated as of 1 January 2013) was 1,785,243.

Donetsk Oblast is located within the regions of [[Zaporizhzhia (region)|Zaporizhzhia]] (northern part) and [[Pryazovia]] (southern part).

=== Cities ===
The largest cities by priority:

# [[Zaporizhzhia]]
# [[Melitopol]] – under [[Russian occupation of Zaporizhzhia Oblast|Russian occupation]]
# [[Berdiansk]] – under Russian occupation
# [[Enerhodar]] (location of the [[Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant]]) – under Russian occupation
# [[Tokmak]] – under Russian occupation
# [[Polohy]] – under Russian occupation
# [[Dniprorudne]] – under Russian occupation
# [[Vilniansk]]
# [[Orikhiv]]
# [[Huliaipole]]
# [[Vasylivka]] – under Russian occupation

=== Relief ===
Zaporizhzhia Oblast is characterized by a flat landscape. [[Soil]]s are mostly [[chernozem]]. Knowledge of the relief of the Zaporizhzhia Oblast today is especially important because of the problem of land reclamation and its more intensive use.

The territory of Zaporizhzhia Oblast as a whole has a flat topography, but there are markedly elevated and depressed areas, which differ in shape, origin, and age.

The highest central-eastern part of the oblast is the [[Azov Upland]]. It extends to the east and to the territory of [[Donetsk Oblast]], where it meets the Donetsk ridge. In the south, between the Azov Upland and the [[Sea of Azov]], is the western part of the Azov coastal plain, which flows into the [[Black Sea]] west of the [[Molochna|Molochna River]]. The northeastern end of the coastal plain merges with the Zaporizhzhia inner plain, which borders the southeastern outskirts of the Dnieper Upland. Thus, the territory of Zaporizhzhia Oblast consists of two distinct [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] parts: the outskirts of the Azov and Dnipro uplands, which structurally correspond to the southeastern part of the Ukrainian crystalline massif and the outskirts of the coastal [[Pryazovia|Pryazov]] and Black Sea plains, which are located within the Black Sea basin.

==History==
The area corresponding approximately to the modern Zaporizhzhia Oblast—according to [[Herodotus]]—was called in antiquity as the land of [[Gerrhos]]. This area was the burial place of the kings of the "Royal [[Scythians]]".

Historically, at various times, the territory was ruled either entirely or partly by [[Scythia]], [[Old Great Bulgaria]], [[Khazars]], the [[Mongol Empire]], [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], the [[Crimean Khanate]], [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. [[Khortytsia]], former fortress of the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], is located in the province. In 1917–1920 the territory passed subsequently between the [[Bolsheviks]], [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukrainians]], [[South Russia (1919–1920)|White Russians]], [[Makhnovshchina|Makhnovists]], the Bolsheviks once again, White Russians once again, and eventually fell to the Bolsheviks in late 1920.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ZAPORIZHZHIA: A LAND OF INDUSTRIAL CAPACITY, OUTSTANDING PEOPLE, AND THE ISLAND THAT CHANGED HISTORY |url=https://ukraine.ua/regions-of-ukraine/zaporizhzhia/}}</ref>

The modern Zaporizhzhia Oblast was created as part of the [[Ukrainian SSR|Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] on 10 January 1939 out of the [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]].
[[File:Хід м. Запоріжжя. 500 років українському козацтву. 1990. 6.JPG|thumb|Zaporizhzhia, [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine]], 1990]]
During the [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum]], 90.66% of votes in the oblast were in favor of the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine]].<ref name="DT150103">{{cite news |url= http://dt.ua/UKRAINE/lishe-3-ukrayinciv-hochut-priyednannya-yih-oblasti-do-rosiyi-160641_.html |script-title=uk:Лише 3% українців хочуть приєднання їх області до Росії |language= uk |trans-title= Only 3% of Ukrainians want their region to become part of Russia |work= [[Dzerkalo Tyzhnia]] |date= 3 January 2015 }}</ref>

During the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]], the Russian armed forces [[Russian occupation of Zaporizhzhia Oblast|occupied the southern part of the oblast]], defeating the Ukrainian armed forces at [[Battle of Melitopol|Melitopol]] and at [[Battle of Enerhodar|Enerhodar]]. Ukrainian forces conducted an attack that [[Berdiansk port attack|destroyed a Russian ship]] and damaged two others in the port of Berdiansk. {{As of|2022|05|post=,}} the northern parts of the oblast, including its capital city, [[Zaporizhzhia]], are controlled by Ukraine.

On 4–5 July 2022 during the international Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC 2022) hosted in the Swiss city [[Lugano]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]] pledged to support the rebuilding of Zaporizhzhia Oblast.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Провідні країни Європи відбудовуватимуть Україну, – Гайдай |url=https://lb.ua/economics/2022/07/05/522198_providni_kraini_ievropi.html |access-date=2022-07-11 |website=LB.ua|date=5 July 2022 }}</ref>

On 23–27 September 2022, the [[Russian Federation]] [[2022 annexation referendums in Russian-occupied Ukraine|held a referendum in the occupied territories]] of [[Kherson Oblast|Kherson]] and Zaporizhzhia oblasts for "independence and subsequent entry into the Russian Federation". These referendums are recognized by most states to be staged and against international law. On 29 September 2022, the Russian Federation recognized Zaporizhzhia Oblast as an independent state.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-09-29 |title=Putin signs decrees paving way for annexing Ukraine territories of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/29/putin-to-sign-treaty-annexing-territories-in-ukraine-kremlin-says |access-date=2022-09-30 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref> On 30 September, Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] announced the [[annexation]] of the Zaporizhzhia Oblast and three other Ukrainian territories, and signed "accession decrees" that are widely considered to be illegal.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-09-30 |title=Putin annexes four regions of Ukraine in major escalation of Russia's war |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/30/putin-russia-war-annexes-ukraine-regions |access-date=2022-09-30 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Maynes |first1=Charles |title=Putin illegally annexes territories in Ukraine, in spite of global opposition |url=https://www.npr.org/2022/09/30/1126020895/russia-ukraine-putin-annexation |access-date=30 September 2022 |work=NPR |date=30 September 2022 |language=en}}</ref> At that time, Russia was only in control of about 70% of the province as a whole.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2022-09-30 |title=Factbox: The four regions that Russia is poised to annex from Ukraine |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/four-regions-that-russia-is-poised-annex-ukraine-2022-09-30/ |access-date=2022-09-30}}</ref> The [[United Nations]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] subsequently passed a [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-11/4|resolution]] calling on countries not to recognise what it described as an "attempted illegal annexation" and demanded that Russia "immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ukraine: UN General Assembly demands Russia reverse course on 'attempted illegal annexation' |date=12 October 2022 |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/10/1129492}}</ref>

[[File:Zaporizhia Oblast 2020 subdivisions.jpg|thumb|650x650px|center|Map of raions of Zaporizhzhia Oblast]]

Following the reforms of 2020, the oblast is divided into five new raions, which is reduced from 25. The system of municipalities (cities of regional significance) that were directly subordinate to the oblast government was discontinued. All populated places were subordinated to raion (district) government.

679 daytime and 11 evening state schools plus 6 daytime schools that are non-budget supported secondary schools involved 271,400 pupils in 2001. 22 classical schools, 8 lyceums, a Sichovy collegium and 54 education-breeding complex bodies aren't out of reach to gifted children. New style 38 complex kindergarten-schools work too.<ref>Запорізька область: Ілюстрована енциклопедія. [Т.2]: Архітектура і містобудування. Культура. Економіка. Райони області / К.С. Карафін, О. І.

Over 60,000 children develop their talents through out-of-school institutions. They attend 30 creative centres, 6 science-technical stations and four young naturalists' stations, five tourist clubs, three training flotillas, 11 children's sports clubs and 20 sports schools. The extra-scholastic education system has such a unique body as the [[Small Academy of Science]]. Boys and girls work there in six main disciplines: physics-mathematics, chemistry-biology, history-geography, philology, industrial and information technologies. The Small Academy young members maintain close friendly relations with scientists of big institutes and universities. 26 youngsters became winners of the All-Ukrainian Academy contest, so the Zaporizhzhia oblast team gained the 1st place.

325 secondary schools, five classical schools, a collegium, and three comprehensive schools use the Ukrainian language. Nevertheless, the minorities have a free choice—193 schools are Russian, a large Jewish school «Alef» works in Zaporizhzhia and smaller ones exist in other points, a Ukrainian-Bulgarian Lyceum is in Primorsky district. The Greek, Czech, Bulgarian languages are very popular in Yakimivsky, Berdyansky, Priazovsky and Melitopole rural districts. One may learn Hebrew, Yiddish, German, Polish, Tatar and other languages attending option courses anywhere.

Specialists keep on looking for an adaptive school model. 26 institutions develop the humanization process using new teaching technologies. The Khortitsky multi-profile teaching-rehabilitation centre has worked out methods for complete support of sanatorium-boarding-schools' children. Berdiansk is the town where a regional boarding school for orphans works out active socialization programs.

42 institutions provide vocational education. This system distributes well-trained workers to regional industries and businesses. The list of specialties includes over 100 names. Vocational schools give courses for improving qualifications in cooperation with unemployment centres. More than 1,500 jobless persons get new professions every year due to it.

The higher education system is the most flexible and advanced. Today, 25 state-controlled technical colleges have I-II class rank and 8 higher institutions have III-IV class certificates. These are the university and the Zaporizhzhia Politechnic, the Medical University and the Institute of Law with Ministry of Internal Affairs in Zaporizhzhia City, the Pedagogical University, the Agricultural Academy in Melitopol and the Pedagogical Institute in Berdiansk. There are also five higher-education private bodies—the Institute of Economics and Information Technologies, the State and Municipal Government Institute and the others. Over 65,000 people are students in this oblast. There are 212 Doctors of Science and 1,420 Candidates of Science among their lecturers. The city of Zaporizhzhia is one of the biggest centres for foreigners' education in Ukraine.

The [[International Astronomical Union]] named two minor planets [[5936 Khadzhinov]] and [[19082 Vikchernov]] in honor of Ukrainians from Zaporizhizhia Oblast who made a significant contribution in science and education.
