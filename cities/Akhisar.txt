With [[archaeology|archaeological]] findings that are proving settlements going back to 3000 BC, Akhisar has been a busy trade center with its strategic location at the intersection of important roads during ancient and medieval ages.  Akhisar also hosted one of the [[Seven churches of Asia]]: Thyatira, which is mentioned in the [[Bible]]. Akhisar maintained its importance as a regional trade center during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman period]].

Today's Akhisar is still the trade and business center in its region. Akhisar's name is internationally associated with [[tobacco]]. The fertile Akhisar Plain produces about 10% of total [[Turkish tobacco]] production. Akhisar's high-quality [[olives]] and [[olive oil]] are also globally known. Olive, walnut and almond cultivation is among the important agricultural activities of Akhisar.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Gazete|first=Banka|date=21 November 2021|title=Manisalı üreticilere fidan desteği devam ediyor|page=https://gazetebanka.com/|work=Gazete Banka|url=https://gazetebanka.com/manisali-ureticilere-fidan-destegi-devam-ediyor/11362/|access-date=21 November 2021}}</ref>

==History==
===Ancient history===
{{Main|Thyatira}}
The town was the most important center in ancient North [[Lydia]]. Findings suggest a possible earlier period of pre-eminence under the [[Hittites]]. [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] occupation of the region took place around 500 BC. Thyateira was later conquered by [[Alexander the Great]]. In later years, Thyateira was captured successively by the [[Seleucid Empire]], the [[Attalid dynasty]] of [[Pergamon]], and by [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]], until the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Era that started in 80 BC.

In 214 AD, the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Caracalla]] promoted the town to the status of a regional and administrative center with powers of [[adjudication]] (conventus). The city flourished considerably under the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s and became a large [[metropolis]] with 3 [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasiums]]. As of the 2nd century AD, Christianity spread in western [[Anatolia]] by the actions of [[Apostles in the New Testament|apostles]] like [[John the Evangelist]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]. Thyatira is mentioned twice in the [[New Testament]]. The [[Book of Acts]] refers to a woman of Thyatira named Lydia (Acts 16:14), though the Apostle Paul converted her to Christ in Philippi of Macedonia, not Thyatira. The other occurrence is as one of the [[Seven churches of Asia|Seven Churches of Asia]], in the church of which was a woman identified as a prophetess and called "Jezebel" for deceiving some of the [[Christians]] there into compromising with [[idolatry]] and committing sexual immorality ([[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 2:18-29).

[[file:ThyatiraBasilika.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of the Thyatira church]]
After the partition of the Roman Empire in 395 and the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|upcoming of Islam at the beginning of the 7th century]], raids by [[Arabs]] resulted in great loss of land for [[Byzantium]] and the region of Thyatira witnessed many battles between [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and Arab forces.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Thyatira was repeatedly attacked by the Arabs and later by the Turks, however it was rebuilt over the ruins.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=J. E. |title=The Revelation in Plain English |date=30 June 2006 |publisher=Dorrance Publishing Company |isbn=978-0-8059-6981-8 |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtTKMuv6480C |language=en |quote=Thyatira was repeatedly attacked by the Arabs and the Turks throughout the years, but each time it was rebuilt over the ruins. Now the city is a Turkish town called Akhisar, with little evidence of its character in the apostolic era.}}</ref> In the 12th century, a large-scale inflow of [[Turkish people|Turkish]] tribes started. Thyatira swayed back and forth between Byzantine and Turkish rulers during for two centuries. In the 14th century, Turks under the [[Anatolian Turkish Beylik|Anatolian Beylik]] of [[Sarukhanids|Saruhan]] conquered all Western Anatolian lands and Thyatira went under Turkish rule in 1307. Towards the end of the same century, Akhisar became part of the extending [[Ottoman Empire]]. Under Ottoman administration, Thyatira was at first a subdistrict (''[[Qadaa|kaza]]'') in the [[sanjak]] (''district'') of Saruhan (corresponding to present-day [[Manisa Province]]) within the larger [[vilayet]] (''province'') of [[Kütahya]].

===Modern period===
Akhisar continued its development in the 17th century. However, since the second half of the 16th century, the [[Celali rebellions|Celâlî rebellions]] in the region took the city under its influence. For this reason, the city walls were repaired at the beginning of the 17th century. Due to the Celali rebellions, some of the people in the vicinity settled here and the population of the city increased. As a matter of fact, [[Evliya Çelebi]] writes that in 1671 the city had twenty-four neighbourhoods and 2600 houses, most of which were covered with tiles. He also records that there were forty-seven mosques, three [[Hammam|hamams]], about 1000 shops, one [[bedesten]], ten inns, seven [[madrasa]]s and twenty-three primary schools, and that it is surrounded by vineyards, gardens and orchards. He also states that there is an old castle ruin on the hill in the middle of the city and that the city was surrounded by walls for fear of the Celâlî named [[Karayazıcı Abdülhalim|Karayazıcı]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=AKHİSAR |url=https://islamansiklopedisi.org.tr/akhisar |access-date=2023-01-05 |website=TDV İslâm Ansiklopedisi |language=tr}}</ref>

During the course of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-22)]] the [[Army of Asia Minor|Greek Army]] invaded the town on June 5, 1919. Due to the developments of the campaign, which included unrest from the Turkish populace, the Greek forces withdrew on June 10, 1919.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Akhisar Tarihçesi |url=https://www.akhisar.bel.tr/akhisar/akhisarin-tarihcesi |access-date=11 January 2023 |website=Akhisar Belediyesi}}</ref> Soon after, Greek forces re-invaded Akhisar during the [[Greek Summer Offensive]] on June 22, 1920.<ref name=":0" /> The [[Turkish National Movement|Turkish Nationalist]] forces captured the town on September 6, 1922, toward the end of the [[Great Offensive]].<ref name=":0" /> Athanasios Karathanasis in his book wrote that following the capture, an estimated 7,000 local [[Greeks]] were killed in Kırtık dere.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Karathanasis |first=Athanasios |date=2013 |title=The Genocide of the Greeks in Asia Minor |url=https://ejournals.lib.auth.gr/kosmos/article/view/5373 |journal=Cosmos |language=en |publisher=[[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] |issue=2 |page=19 |doi=10.26262/kosmos.v2i0.5373 |issn=2529-0797 |quote=In Axari [Akhisar], 7.000 out of 10.000 Greeks were slaughtered in the gorge of Kirtik Dere.}}</ref> The remaining were party to the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Yıldırım |first1=Onur |title=Diplomacy and Displacement: Reconsidering the Turco-Greek Exchange of Populations, 1922-1934 |date=2006 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-97982-5 |url=https://www.academia.edu/4394667}}</ref>{{Request quotation|date=June 2022}}<ref>Κατάλογος των προσφυγικών συνοικισμών της Μακεδονίας σύμφωνα με τα στοιχεία της Επιτροπής Αποκαταστάσεως Προσφύγων (ΕΑΠ) έτος 1928</ref>{{Request quotation|date=June 2022}} Furthermore, although the local Muslims had sworn on the [[Quran]] that they would protect the remaining Armenian community upon the arrival of the Turkish army in town, they instead cooperated with them in plundering and massacring the Armenians.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Göçek |first1=Fatma Müge |title=Denial of Violence: Ottoman Past, Turkish Present, and Collective Violence Against the Armenians, 1789-2009 |date=2015 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-062458-3 |pages=319–320 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xHcRDAAAQBAJ |language=en |quote=In İzmir, all the Armenians were rounded up, and after all their belongings and money were taken away, they were imprisoned, beaten, and raped.

In ancient times, Thyateira was an important center of activity. It was on the ancient roads from [[Byzantium]] to [[Pergamum]], [[Sardis]], and [[Ephesus]]. Thyateira was at the center of many small towns and villages which were administratively and politically bound to it. Cloth and pottery trade was the main activity in town. Production of wool, linen, brass goods, and [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] were other commercial activities. The city remained as a center of trade activity for centuries. Akhisar's cloth and cords were reputable in [[Istanbul]] markets. Among the other agricultural merchandise were olives, olive oil, water melons, grapes, and raisins.

This high level of economical activity made Akhisar the most important subdistrict within the [[sanjak]] of [[Manisa Province|Saruhan]]. The first Ottoman records about Akhisar date back to the 16th century. These records indicate that Akhisar was a district center which paid 40% more income tax than the seat of the Saruhan Sanjak, present-day [[Manisa]]. At the end of the 19th century, urban population had reached 30,000. In the [[Turkey|Republican]] era, Akhisar pursued its development. Many modern avenues and streets were built. In recent years {{when|date=January 2017}}, a new stadium and grass soccer field were built, along with many parks and recreational areas. Many banks, shops and tourist hotels are now lined up along the busy main street (Tahir Un Avenue) which connects the train station to the city center.

An industrial zone specializing in automotive repair and small parts production, along with a number of factories such as olive oil production plants, brick factories, tobacco (cigarette) factories were constructed. The Greater Akhisar Industrial Zone is currently under development. Since the city is located on the State Highway 565 between [[İzmir]] and [[Istanbul]]—Turkey's two most important ports—Akhisar Industrial Zone offers attractive investment opportunities for both domestic and foreign investors.

Today chess is very popular in Akhisar. Every year during the Caglak Festival hundreds of children participate in chess events. In 2009 the World Youth Under 16 Chess Olympiad was held in Akhisar from September 24 through October 3.

==Historical sites==
[[File:Akhisar Turkey 1890 engraving.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Akhisar in an 1890 [[engraving]]]]
Ancient Akhisar is almost entirely covered by the buildings and streets of the modern town. However, buildings and ruins from ancient times and the Middle Ages can still be seen all over the town. One is very likely to see ancient stones or columnheads in street corners in the older city.

===Tomb of State Hospital===
This is a man-made tomb in the city center with Hellenistic ruins. However, some houseware findings on this hill reveal the existence of some primitive settlements dating back to 9000 BC. Archeologists assume that the hill once hosted the acropol of ancient Thyateira. The Byzantine and Turkish names of the city were derived from the white painted towers on this castle. (Turkish name Akhisar, in Turkish: Ak = white + hisar = castle or, Byzantine name Asprokastro, in Greek Aspro=white + kastro=castle). This small hill has hosted the State Hospital since World War II. Today, a Hellenistic tablet and [[sarcophagus]] can be seen in the hospital garden.

===Tepemezari===
Some ruins of an ancient building complex and colonnaded road can be seen in "Tepemezari" area in downtown. The [[portico]] is estimated to have a length of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It possibly connects the entrance of the large ancient building complex to the city [[acropolis]]. Tepemezarlığı was subjected to an in depth archaeological excavation between 1969 and 1971. These excavations revealed the walls of a rectangular Roman building along north–south direction with dimensions of about {{convert|40|by|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The compound has been arranged into an archaeological park near downtown.

===Akhisar coins===
It is generally admitted that money was invented by Lydians in the 7th century BC in western Anatolia. Thyateira, being the most important center in the North ancient Lydia, was definitely one of the first towns where money was used. Towards 200 BC, important trade centers started minting their own coins.

Oldest Thyateira coin is made of bronze and belongs to times when the rule of Pergamon was prevalent. Thyateira coins usually display the figures of [[Apollo]] and [[Artemis]] on one side and a double sided axe on the other. During 50s AD, Thyateira printed coins bearing figures of Roman emperors, local governors and city administrators. Roman coins also revealed some sports activities and festivals in Thyateira.

Some of the coins found indicate that there was once an economic alliance between Thyateira, [[Smyrna]] ([[İzmir]]) and [[Pergamon]] ([[Bergama]]).

===Falcon Rock===
The Sahin Kaya or "Falcon Rock" is a big high rock in the Eastern county territory. It hosts some ancient and middle age ruins. This big mass of rock has a very strategic location controlling the Akhisar and [[Pergamon]] plains, a large part of the Lydian territories. The location and castle indicate that the settlement was a defensive sentinel station. Access is possible by a tough walk of 3,050 steps up an ancient stairway carved into the rock.

===Lydian tombs===
The man-made tombs along modern Akhisar – [[Gölmarmara]] road are ancient Lydian graves. These tombs usually have one single grave room.

Similar tombs can also be seen near modern villages of Beyoba, Mecidiye, Süleymanlı and Eroğlu. There are also a number of Lydian and [[Phrygia]]n graves carved in rock.

===Ulucami (The Great Mosque)===
This ancient building was transformed to a mosque in the 15th century. The year of construction is unknown but it is evident that the building was formerly a [[Byzantine]] church and possibly an earlier [[Roman temple]]. There is even a possibility for the building to be one of the famous Seven Churches of Christianity.

===Aynali Mosque===
Aynali Mosque was almost reconstructed in 1958 due to excessive wear. Some ancient columns and building blocks found in the garden suggests that there was a large building of ancient Thyateira in the area. Mosque garden also hosts the finest samples of the Turkish art of stone carving.

===Zeynelzade Library and Hashoca Mosque===
The library was constructed in 1798 by Zeynelzade's, a reputable family of Akhisar. The building is located in Hashoca Quarter, close to Hashoca Mosque. According to records of 1805, there were 923 volumes of manuscripts. A modern library with the same name was constructed in the 20th century in another part of the city, serving students and researchers.

===Jewish graveyard===
Next to the Reşat Bey Cemetery, there is a Jewish Graveyard of about 673 square meters (7200&nbsp;ft²). Gravestones with carvings in [[Hebrew]] can be seen.

===Jewish synagogue===
Right behind the modern Turkish Telecom Directorate Building there is an historical  [[synagogue]]. Unfortunately, not much remained except its old gate.

===Kayalıoğlu Jewish school===
{{main|Or Yehuda Agriculture School}}
The School of Agriculture built by the Jewish family of Kayalıoglu is still in good shape. The building was built in the beginning of the 20th century. The 3 story building has been recently abandoned. There are orchards and various trees surrounding the building, once used in practical studies. The basement of the building served as a winery. The building and yard occupies an area of about {{convert|2|acre|m2}}. Other small buildings accompany the old school building.
