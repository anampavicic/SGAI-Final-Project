'''Bekasi''' ({{IPA|id|ˈbəkasi}}, {{langx|su|{{Sund|ᮘᮨᮊᮞᮤ}}}}) is the 
[[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|city]] with the largest population in the province of [[West Java]],  [[Indonesia]], located on the eastern border of [[Jakarta]]. It serves as a [[commuter town|commuter city]] within the [[Jakarta metropolitan area|Greater Jakarta]]. According to the 2020 Census by [[Statistics Indonesia]] (BPS), Bekasi had 2,543,676 inhabitants.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> The (revised) official estimate for mid 2023 was 2,513,669.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 26 September 2024, ''Kota Bekasi Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.3275)</ref> It lies within the largest metropolitan area in Indonesia (''[[Jabodetabek]]''). The city is bordered by [[Bekasi Regency]] (from which the city was separated administratively on 16 December 1996) to the north and the east, [[Bogor Regency]] and [[Depok]] City to the south, and the city of [[East Jakarta]] to the west.

Bekasi is one of the oldest cities in Indonesia, and has a history of being the capital city of the [[Tarumanagara|Kingdom of Tarumanagara]]. At that time, the name of Bekasi was '''Dayeuh Sundasembawa''' or '''Jayagiri'''. The earliest evidence of its existence dates from the fifth century according to the [[Tugu inscription]], which describes the name of two rivers that run through the city, i.e. Candrabhaga and Gomati and one of those rivers, i.e. '''Candrabhaga''' is the origin of the name Bekasi where the name Candrabhaga evolved into "Bhagasasi" - due to the Sanskrit word candra (which means moon) evolved into [[Old Sundanese language|Old Sundanese]] word 'sasi' which also means moon - and then the name Bhagasasi was mis-spelt as "Bhagasi", and then the Dutch colonial government also mis-spelt the name Bhagasi as "Bacassie", and finally it became "Bekasi".<ref>http://www.bekasikota.go.id [http://www.bekasikota.go.id/read/65/sejarah-kota-bekasi Sejarah Kota Bekasi]</ref> During the [[Dutch East Indies]] period, Bekasi was a part of [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] residency. As a dormitory city, many middle class satellite areas have been developed in Bekasi,<ref>http://properti.kompas.com [http://properti.kompas.com/read/2014/07/15/120935021/Pasar.Middle-up.Bekasi.Menggiurkan.Rumah.Harga.Rp.800.Juta.Paling.Dicari. Pasar "Middle-up" Bekasi Menggiurkan, Rumah Harga Rp 800 Juta Paling Dicari!]</ref> complete with their own shopping malls, schools, hospitals, club houses, [[water park]], and shuttle bus services to [[central Jakarta]]. The large number of [[multinational companies]] has apparently attracted many expatriates (mainly [[Japanese migration to Indonesia|Japanese]] and [[Koreans in Indonesia|Korean]]) to settle in Bekasi.<ref>Peter J. Katzenstein, Takashi Shiraishi; Beyond Japan: The Dynamics of East Asian Regionalism; 2006</ref>

==Economy==
Bekasi has already grown to become one of the main centres of growth in '''Jabodetabek'''. The city accounts for 2.11% of total national [[Gross domestic product|GDP]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://finance.detik.com/berita-ekonomi-bisnis/d-3496234/ekonomi-jakarta-digabung-bekasi-bogor-dan-tangerang-capai-rp-2490-t|title=Ekonomi Jakarta Digabung Bekasi, Bogor, dan Tangerang Capai Rp 2.490 T|first=Maikel|last=Jefriando}}</ref> Recently, many foreigners (mostly Korean, [[Japanese people|Japanese]], and Chinese) have set up their business to take advantage of its dynamism and boost its economy. Bekasi's economy was mainly based on service and manufacturing. Nowadays, Bekasi's economy also supported by services industry.

===Commerce===
Bekasi is one of the most promising property markets in [[Jabodetabek]] besides [[South Tangerang]], and several high-value developments have transformed its property market. Many of country's big property developers are building apartments, hotels, and shopping malls in the city. In recent years, some residences have developed along the Jatiwarna/Jatibening&nbsp;— East Bekasi toll highway, further to Cibatu in Bekasi Regency. These include [[Kota Harapan Indah]], [[Summarecon Bekasi]], Kemang Pratama and Grand Galaxy City.

Prime business and commercial centres are situated in the western part of city. There are some financial centres, restaurants, and shopping centres along Jalan Ahmad Yani, Jalan Sudirman, Jalan K.H. Noer Alie, and Harapan Indah Boulevard. The largest shopping centre is Grand Metropolitan with over {{cvt|125,000|sqm}} of floor space.<ref>https://www.lamudi.co.id/ [https://www.lamudi.co.id/projects/mall-grand-metropolitan-bekasi/ Mal Grand Metropolitan Bekasi Resmi Dibuka]</ref> 
Other shopping centres include [[Metropolitan Mall]], Summarecon Mal Bekasi, Mal Ciputra Cibubur, Mega Bekasi Hypermall, Grand Galaxy Park, Grand Mall, Blu Plaza, BTC Mall, GP Mall, Bekasi Cyber Park, Plaza Pondok Gede, and Lagoon Avenue. Many hotels developed in Bekasi, such as [[Santika Indonesia Hotels & Resorts|Santika]], Horison, Harris, Aston Imperial, Amaris, Amaroossa and [[Tune Hotels|Tune Hotel]].

==Infrastructure==
[[File:Bekasi Mall Night 2.jpg|thumb|right|Bekasi commercial centers]]
The development of large scale residential areas and industrial parks in Bekasi has been induced by infrastructure development, especially roads, highways and railways.

===Road and highway===
Bekasi is connected by the [[Trans-Java Toll Road]], the main road across Java. There are three expressways connections from the [[Jabodetabek]] urban area: the [[Jakarta–Cikampek Toll Road]], which has three exits in Bekasi; the [[Jakarta Outer Ring Road]], which provides access to [[Tangerang]], Jakarta and [[Bogor]]; and the new [[Bekasi-Cawang-Kampung Melayu Toll Road]]. In 2019, Jakarta-Cikampek elevated toll road will operate to ease traffic on the current toll road between Cikunir and West Karawang with a total length of 36.4 kilometres.<ref>https://en.republika.co.id/berita/pewnut414/50-percent-of-jakartacikampek-elevated-toll-road-completed 50 percent of Jakarta-Cikampek elevated toll road completed</ref> Owing to its location as a satellite city of [[Jakarta]], heavy [[rush hour]] traffic jams have become common on the roads between East Jakarta and Bekasi.

== Hydrology ==
The City of Bekasi is traversed by the main river, the [[Kali Bekasi|Kali Bekasi (Bekasi River)]], along with its tributaries. The Bekasi River originates from the confluence of the Cikeas and Cileungsi rivers, which have their sources in the mountains of Bogor Regency. Surface water in the Bekasi area includes the Bekasi River, several smaller rivers, and the [[Tarum Barat irrigation canals]] used for irrigating fields. This water serves as the raw water source for the drinking water needs of the Bekasi region (both the city and the regency) and the DKI Jakarta area. Currently, the surface water condition of the Bekasi River is polluted by industrial waste originating from the southern part of the City of Bekasi (industries located in Bogor Regency).<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Pemerintah Kota Bekasi - kondisi geografis wilayah kota bekasi. |url=https://www.bekasikota.go.id/pages/kondisi-geografis-wilayah-kota-bekasi |access-date=2023-11-04 |website=www.bekasikota.go.id}}</ref>

The City of Bekasi is a part of the [[:Category:Bekasi basin|Bekasi river basin]], located in the downstream area of the basin with slopes ranging from 0 to 2% and elevations between 11 meters to 81 meters above sea level.
