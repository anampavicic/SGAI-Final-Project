'''Tabuk''' ({{langx|ar|تَبُوْك}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Tabūk}}'', {{IPA|ar|taˈbu:k|lang}}) is the capital city of the [[Tabuk Province|Tabuk Region]] in northwestern [[Saudi Arabia]]. It has a population of 594,350 (as of 2022). It is close to the [[Jordan–Saudi Arabia border]] and houses the largest air force base in Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{citation |last=Mackey |first=Sandra |title=The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom |publisher=[[W.W. Norton and Company]] |location=New York |year=2002 |page=234 |isbn=0-393-32417-6}} Updated Edition. Norton Paperback. First edition: 1987; Pbk.</ref>

== History ==
[[Ptolemy]] mentioned a place by the name 'Tabawa', at the northwestern corner of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. This name may be a reference to 'Tabuka' or 'Tabuk'. If this is true, the town may be as old as Ptolemy's time. [[Arabic poetry#Pre-Islamic poetry|Pre-Islamic Arab poets]] such as Antra and Nabiqa mention its mountain 'Hasmi' in their poems.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

Tabouk became famous for the [[Expedition of Tabuk]] in 630 CE, during the period of the [[prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. Since then, it remained a gateway of North Arabia. It was visited by [[Charles Montagu Doughty]] in 1877. 

Tabuk was captured by the Arab forces in 1918, three weeks after the British [[capture of Damascus]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Saunders|first=Nicholas J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v771DwAAQBAJ|title=Desert Insurgency: Archaeology, T. E. Lawrence, and the Arab Revolt|date=2020-08-12|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-103071-0|pages=683|language=en}}</ref> Tabuk became a centre of military activity during the [[Gulf War|1991 Gulf War]] as the city faced threats from [[Scud missile|Iraqi Scud missiles]] and air attacks{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}.

== Archaeology ==
The region is rich in antiquities and archaeological sites such as petroglyphs, inscriptions, forts, palaces, walls, Syrian-Egyptian pilgrimage route, and the remains of the [[Hejaz railway]], the main station of which is located in Tabuk.

Hundreds of localities with rock art and inscriptions dating to different chronological periods and ranging from Paleolithic to the Islamic period were recorded at Wadi Dam and the region west of Tabuk. Study of the art revealed rich stylistic variability and both human and animal figures were represented in it. Numerous sites in the area with [[Thamudic]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Nabataean Arabic|Nabataean]] inscriptions have been found.{{Main|Tabuk Castle}}
[[Tabuk Castle]], known as the castle of ''[[Aṣ-ḥāb al-Aykah]]'' ({{langx|ar|أَصْـحَـاب الْأَيْـكَـة}}, "Companions of the Wood"), is mentioned in the [[Quran]].<ref>{{qref|15|78-79|b=y}}</ref><ref>{{qref|26|176-189|b=y}}</ref><ref>{{qref|38|13-15|b=y}}</ref><ref>{{qref|50|12-14|b=y}}</ref> The castle dates back to about 3500 BCE and has been restored many times; the last was in 1652. Several forts and stations were built along the Syrian pilgrimage route, from the Jordanian border to [[Medina]]  to welcome the [[Hajj|pilgrims]]. The fort consists of two floors built around an open courtyard with a mosque, a well, and a stairway leading to the watch towers used by the guards. Tabuk Castle is considered an archaeological landmark of the region and is open to visitors.

Ain Sukkrah is an ancient ''‘spring'' ({{langx|ar|عـيـن}}, 'ayn') dating back to [[Jahiliyyah|Iron Age times]] ({{langx|ar|جَـاهـلـيّـة}}, 'Ignorance'). There is a legend that during the expedition of Tabuk, Muhammad camped more than ten days near the spring and drank from its water.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The Prophet's Mosque is also known as the Repentance Mosque. It was originally built with mud and roofed with palm trunk trees. It was restored in 1652. Eventually, its complete renewal was ordered by the late King Faisal ibn Abdul-Aziz, along the pattern of the [[Prophet's Mosque]] in Medina.

== Demographics ==
In 1950, Tabuk had a population of 12,000. By 2022, this number had grown to 594,350.
