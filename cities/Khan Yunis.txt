'''Khan Yunis''' ({{langx|ar|خان يونس ||lit=Caravansary [of] Yonis<ref name="name-ref-anera.org">{{cite web |title=Name Reference - Anera.org |url=https://www.anera.org/stories/anera-in-khan-younis-palestine/}}</ref>}}), also spelled '''Khan Younis''' or '''Khan Yunus''', is a Palestinian [[city]] serving as the capital of the [[Khan Yunis Governorate]] in the southern [[Gaza Strip]]. It has been largely destroyed on account of the ongoing [[Israel–Hamas war]].

Before the 14th century, Khan Yunis was a village known as "Salqah". To protect caravans, pilgrims and travellers a vast [[caravanserai]] – today known as [[Barquq Castle]] – was constructed there by the [[emir]] Yūnus an-Nūrūzī in 1387–88, an official of the [[Mamluk Empire]].<ref name=Sharon/>

According to the [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]], Khan Yunis had a population of 205,125 in 2017.<ref name="PrelimCensus2017" /> Khan Yunis, which lies only {{convert|4|km|mi|frac=2|abbr=off|spell=in}} east of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], has a [[semi-arid climate]] with temperature of 30&nbsp;°C maximum in summer and 10&nbsp;°C minimum in winter, with an annual rainfall of approximately {{convert|260|mm|1|abbr=on}}.

==History==
[[File:Khan Yunis-1930s.jpg|thumb|right|The southern part of the historic ''[[khan (inn)|khan]]'' at Khan Yunis, 1930s]]

===Ancient period===
[[Herodotus]] describes a city named ''Ienysos'' ({{Langx|grc|Ιηνυσος}}) located between [[Lake Bardawil|Lake Serbonis]] and [[Gaza City|Kadytis]] (modern Gaza city). He talks about how the Persian military marched through the location on its way to Egypt. He also describes how the coastal area between [[Gaza City|Kadytis]] and Ienysos was inhabited by [[Bedouin|local Arab tribes]]. Some sources, due to phonological resemblance of the names and due to the general matching of the geographic locations, associate this site with modern Khan Yunis.<ref name="Retsö">Retsö, J. (2014). ''The Arabs in antiquity: Their history from the Assyrians to the Umayyads - "Chapter 9: The Age of the Achaemenids - Herodotus of Halicarnassus"''. Routledge.</ref>

Other sources have suggested a further inland location of "Khirbet Ma'in Abu Sitta" (Palestinian village depopulated in 1949, near modern kibbutz of [[Nir Oz]])<ref>Abu-Sitta, S. H. (2017). ''Mapping my return: A Palestinian memoir''. American University in Cairo Press.</ref> or the Egyptian town of [[Arish]] as possible locations of Ienysos, but there is no clear evidence to support this identification.<ref name="Retsö"/><ref>{{Cite book |last=Verreth |first=Herbert |title=The northern Sinai from the 7th century BC till the 7th century AD.

Ancient discoveries in Khan Yunis feature a [[lintel]] with a [[Greek language|Greek]] inscription, discovered repurposed in the tomb of Sheikh Hamada. The inscription translates to: '''Hilarion - giving thanks to [[Saint George|St. Georgius]]''.' Originally housed in the Musée de Notre Dame de France in Jerusalem, the lintel is currently lost.<ref>{{Citation |title=XXXVIII.

The khan served as resting stop for couriers of the ''[[barid]]'', the Mamluk [[Postal history of Palestine|postal network]] in Palestine and Syria.

===Ottoman period===
In late 1516 Khan Yunis was the site of a minor [[Battle of Yaunis Khan|battle]] in which the Egypt-based Mamluks were defeated by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces under the leadership of [[Hadim Sinan Pasha|Sinan Pasha]]. The Ottoman sultan [[Selim I]] then arrived in the area where he led the Ottoman army across the [[Sinai Peninsula]] to conquer Egypt.<ref>Pitcher, p. 105.</ref> During the 17th and 18th centuries the Ottomans assigned an [[Azeb|Asappes]] garrison associated with the [[Cairo Citadel]] to guard the fortress at Khan Yunis.<ref>Hathaway, 2002, p.

At the end of the 19th-century the Ottomans established a municipal council to administer the affairs of Khan Yunis, which had become the second largest town in the Gaza District after [[Gaza City|Gaza]] itself.<ref>Feldman, 2008, p.

In the [[1922 census of Palestine]] conducted by the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate authorities]], Khan Yunis had a population of 3890 inhabitants (3866 Muslims, 23 Christians, and one Jew),<ref name=Census1922>Barron, 1923,  Table V, [[Gaza Subdistrict, Mandatory Palestine|Sub-district of Gaza]], p.

In the 1938 village statistics, the population is listed as 4,379 (including three Jews) with 3,953 in nearby suburbs.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/yabber/census/VillageStatistics1938orig.pdf |title=Village Statistics |year=1938 |pages=64}}</ref> In the [[Village Statistics, 1945|1945 statistics]], Khan Yunis had a population of 11,220 (11,180 Muslims and 40 Christians),<ref name=1945p31>Department of Statistics, 1945, p.

During the [[Nazi]] occupation of the [[Dodecanese]], many Greeks from Dodecanese islands such as [[Kastelorizo]] sought refuge in the nearby [[Nuseirat Camp]].

===1948–1967===
During the night of 31 August 1955, three Israeli [[Paratroopers Brigade|paratroop]] companies attacked the British-built [[Tegart fort]] in Khan Yunis from where attacks had been carried out against Israelis.<ref name="Katz" /> The police station, a petrol station and several buildings in the village of [[Abasan al-Kabera|Abasan]] were destroyed, as well as railway tracks and [[telegraph]] poles. In heavy fighting, 72 Egyptian soldiers were killed. One Israeli soldier was killed and 17 were wounded. The operation led to a ceasefire on September 4, forcing President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and the Egyptian government to halt [[Palestinian fedayeen#Suez Crisis|Palestinian fedayeen operations]] against Israel.<ref>Derori, 2005,  p. 142</ref> One of the mechanized companies was commanded by [[Rafael Eitan]].<ref name="Katz">Katz, 1988, p.  10</ref><ref>Morris, 1993, p. 350</ref>

Before the [[Suez War]], Khan Yunis was officially administered by the [[All-Palestine Government]], seated in Gaza and later in Cairo. After a fierce firefight, the [[Sherman tank]]s of the IDF 37th Armored Brigade broke through the heavily fortified lines outside of Khan Yunis held by the 86th Palestinian Brigade.<ref name="Varble, Derek page 46">Varble, 2003,   p.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=MrP3kgd4sf8C&pg=PA46 46]</ref> It was the only site in the Gaza strip where the Egyptian army put up any resistance to the Israeli invasion of Gaza, but it surrendered on 3 November 1956.

There are conflicting reports of what happened. Israel said that Palestinians were killed when Israeli forces were still facing armed resistance, while the Palestinians said all resistance had ceased by then, and that many unarmed civilians were killed as the Israel troops went through the town and camp, seeking men in possession of arms.<ref name="lat">{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-feb-04-la-et-joe-sacco4-2010feb04-story.html|title=Joe Sacco produces comics from the hot zones|work=Los Angeles Times|date=February 4, 2010|author=Reed Johnson}}</ref><ref name="un" />

The killings, dubbed the [[Khan Yunis massacre]], were reported to the UN General Assembly on 15 December 1956 by the Director of the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency]], Henry Labouisse. According to the report, the exact number of dead and wounded is not known, but the director received lists of names of persons allegedly killed from a trustworthy source, including 275 people, of which 140 were refugees and 135 local residents.<ref name="un">[http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/6558f61d3db6bd4505256593006b06be?OpenDocument UNRWA Report to the UN General Assembly November 1&nbsp;– December 14, 1956] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629110942/http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/6558f61d3db6bd4505256593006b06be?OpenDocument |date=June 29, 2013 }}.: "The town of Khan Yunis and the Agency's camp adjacent thereto were occupied by Israel troops on the morning of 3 November.

On the other hand, the refugees state that all resistance had ceased at the time of the incident and that many unarmed civilians were killed as the Israel troops went through the town and camp, seeking men in possession of arms. The exact number of dead and wounded is not known, but the Director has received from sources he considers trustworthy lists of names of persons allegedly killed on 3 November, numbering 275 individuals, of whom 140 were refugees and 135 local residents of Khan Yunis."</ref><ref name="ap">{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/graphic-novel-on-idf-massacres-in-gaza-set-to-hit-bookstores-1.1677|title=Graphic novel on IDF 'massacres' in Gaza set to hit bookstores|work=Haaretz|date=Dec 21, 2009}}</ref>

After 1959, the All-Palestine Government of Gaza Strip was abolished and the city was included in the [[United Arab Republic]], which was shortly disestablished and the Gaza Strip came under the direct [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|Egyptian military occupation rule]].

===1967 and aftermath===
[[File:The home of the Kware' family, after it was bombed by the military.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Kaware house in after bombing in 2014, see [[Mass civilian casualties of Israeli bombing, shelling and rocket attacks on the Gaza Strip#Kaware family home|Kaware family home]]]]

In 1967, during the [[Six-Day War]], [[Israel]] occupied Khan Yunis again.

As a result of the 1993-1995 [[Oslo Accords]], Khan Yunis and most of the Gaza Strip (excluding Israeli settlements and military areas) were placed under the control of the [[Palestinian Authority]].

Khan Yunis was the site of [[Israel]]i helicopter attacks in August 2001 and October 2002 that left several civilians killed, hundreds wounded and civilian buildings within the vicinity destroyed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2024}}

The Palestinian Authority came into control of the entirety of the Strip following the [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|2005 Israeli disengagement]]. However, following the [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|Battle of Gaza]] in 2007, [[Hamas]] took over the Gaza Strip and established [[Hamas government in the Gaza Strip|its own government]] in the region.

===Israel–Hamas war===

During the ongoing Israel–Hamas war, Israel has bombed Khan Yunis along with other cities in the Gaza Strip as part of an offensive against Hamas.
