Mbeya has weather with enough rainfall and fertile soil which enable it to be the largest producer of maize, rice, bananas, beans, potatoes (Irish & sweet), soya nuts and wheat in the entire country. Tanzania has a [[free market]] in agricultural produce, and Mbeya transports vast amounts of its maize to other areas of Tanzania. There is also extensive animal husbandry, with dairy cattle predominating. Mbeya is also the biggest producer of high-value export and cash crops in Tanzania; those crops are coffee (arabica), tea, cocoa, [[Pyrethrum|pyrethirum]] and spices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/470811468116659028/text/multi-page.txt |title=Agricultural Sector Report |publisher=documents1.worldbank.org |date=1983 |access-date=2021-01-26}}</ref> There is some [[smallholding|smallholder]] cultivation of tobacco. Firewood is collected by women and girls, from the wooded valleys and mountainsides. [[Bamboo]] is naturally abundant in the forests, and there are plans to teach local people about this versatile plant and its many uses. Some gold is still mined in the rural Chunya District, by artisan miners.

Mbeya is considered to be heading the Southern Highlands Regions, that's why there is a Mbeya Referral Hospital which serves the whole of the Southern Highlands regions. The [[Bank of Tanzania]], Mbeya Cement Company, Afri Bottlers Company [[Coca-Cola Company]], SBC Tanzania Ltd [[Pepsi Cola Company]], Tanzania Breweries Limited, NMB, TIB, Mbozi Coffee Curing Limited, Tukuyu Tea Company, Tanzania Oxygen Limited [[TOL - KYEJO]], CRDB all these serve as zonal representative for southern Highlands.

The area around Mbeya town (especially in Tukuyu) enjoys abundant and reliable rainfall which stimulates abundant agriculture on the rich volcanic soils.

===Mountain reserves and wildlife===
[[File:Mbalizi Mbeya Tanzania -0003.jpg|thumb|An aerial view of Mbeya.]]
[[File:Mbeya road.jpg|thumb|The road outside of Mbeya.]]
The area around Mbeya has been called the "[[Scotland]] of Africa". The hills are clad in [[Calluna|heather]] and [[bracken]], but [[botany|botanically]] they are more closely related to the [[Fynbos]] (fine bush) of South Africa's [[Western Cape Province]] than the [[Highlands of Scotland]]. The nearest mountain to Mbeya is [[Loleza Mountain]], which rises over and behind the town. Mbeya Peak is visible but some distance away.

[[Mount Rungwe]] is the highest mountain in the wider Mbeya region and it dominates the skyline for several kilometers around. It is composed of ten or more dormant [[volcanic crater]]s and domes. Rising above the small town of [[Tukuyu]], at {{convert|2,960|m|ft|0|disp=or}}, Rungwe is southern Tanzania's highest peak, and is among the highest in the country after some of the peaks in northern Tanzania such as [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] ({{convert|5,895|m|ft|0|disp=or}}) and [[Mount Meru (Tanzania)|Mount Meru]] ({{convert|4,565|m|ft|0|disp=or}}). Mount Rungwe is surrounded by a catchment forest reserve that was gazetted in 1949. This forest reserve incorporates [[montane forest]], upper montane forest and montane grassland, with lesser amounts of [[bushland]] and [[Heath (habitat)|heath]] at the upper elevations, found in low bushes along streams and at the edges of montane forest. The forest is home to a variety of significant forest flora and fauna, including the threatened [[Abbott's Duiker]].  The forest is regarded as an important bird area, with two species listed as vulnerable. The most notable creatures are [[Rungwe bush viper]]s and [[Colobus]] [[monkey]]s.

Also ecologically important are the [[Poroto Mountains]], south-east of Mbeya. In 2005, a completely new species of large monkey, the [[Kipunji]], was discovered living in the southern highlands to the south-west of Mbeya. The Mbeya region has not yet been closely studied by scientists.

The Kitulo Plateau, famous for its orchids and display of native flora is now within the designated [[Kitulo National Park]].

Forests in the area, even in the reserves, continue to be encroached upon and degraded. However, there has also been extensive tree and forest planting, which ensures the local firewood supply. There is a small illicit trade in [[orchid]] bulbs, which is thought to be endangering the survival of some species.

== Transport ==
===Railway Station===
[[File:Mbeya Railway Station.jpg|thumb|The Mbeya Railway Station.]]

Mbeya is served by the Mbeya Railway Station which is near the A104 or via the [[TAZARA Railway|TAZARA railway]] line from the capital (approx. 600-miles, two overnight passenger trains per week).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.railwaysafrica.com/blog/2010/11/tanzam-journey/ |title= Tanzam Journey |date= 9 November 2010 |access-date= 21 June 2011 |work= Railways Africa |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120423094011/http://www.railwaysafrica.com/blog/2010/11/tanzam-journey/ |archive-date= 23 April 2012}}</ref>

[[Auric Air]] and [[Tropical Air]] fly from Songwe to Dar es Salaam.<ref>2014 route map, {{cite web |url=http://www.fastjet.com/tz/destinations |title= Route Map |date= 2014|website=www.fastjet.com|access-date=2021-01-26}}</ref> [[Songwe Airport|Songwe International Airport]] is within Mbeya region and not in the new Songwe region.

The rains normally start in October and end around May, followed by a dry and cold spell between June and September. Conventional tourism is not a major contributor to the local economy and there are no visible months with peak tourism.

The city lies in the [[Rift valley|Rift Valley]] and is considered Csb by the Köppen-Geiger system. The cooler and mountainous climate in the town attracts mainly locals from other parts of the country and foreigners for the game watching and [[Trout|trout fishing]]. The local government has begun trying to widen tourism beyond animal and wild game viewing, and have invested in producing better mapping and developing a local tourist center.<ref>{{cite web|title = Tourism and Wildlife {{!}} Mbeya Region|url = http://www.mbeya.go.tz/sectors/category/tourism|website = www.mbeya.go.tz|access-date = 2016-02-07|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160208013531/http://www.mbeya.go.tz/sectors/category/tourism|archive-date = 8 February 2016}}</ref>

Well-defined hiking trails have been established to enable hikers to reach the elevated areas and bio-diverse highlands, although the trails need to be properly [[map]]ped.  For self-sufficient [[hiker]]s, there are various routes in the [[Poroto Mountains]] around the small town of [[Tukuyu]].

Some notable local tourist attractions in the area include:
# [[Kitulo National Park]]
# [[Ruaha National Park]]
# [[Lake Nyasa]]
# [[Mbosi meteorite]]
# Mwalalo Water Falls
# The great rift valley viewing point
# Kisiba/masoko crater lake

The city also has various rock and cave painting sites. Many of the rock sites have still been undocumented by the Antiequits department and provide a looking glass into the traditional cultures of the local surrounding communities.

The city also has a significant number of transit passengers heading towards [[Lusaka]]/[[Malawi]] from [[Dar es Salaam Port]] that often make a stop in the city for overnight lodging or food.

==Sports and culture==
