Roraima is the [[List of Brazilian states by population|least populous state in Brazil]], with an estimated population of 631,181 inhabitants as of 2020.<ref name=":0" /> It is also the state with the lowest [[population density]] in Brazil, with 2.01 inhabitants per square kilometre.

The history of Roraima is strongly linked to the [[Branco River]], which allowed the first [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] settlers to arrive in the region. The Branco River Valley's strategic position made it coveted by the [[English people|English]] and the [[Dutch people|Dutch]], who entered Brazil through the [[Guiana Shield]] in search of indigenous people to be [[Slavery|enslaved]]. The [[Spaniards]] also came to invade the northern part of the Branco River and the [[Uraricoera River]] through Venezuela. The Portuguese settlers defeated and expelled all invaders, establishing [[Portugal]]'s sovereignty over the region of Roraima and part of the Amazonas.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History of Roraima|url=http://www.roraimavirtual.com.br/historia_rr.htm|url-status=|access-date=February 14, 2016|website=Roraima virtual}}{{dead link|date=September 2023}}</ref>

As a result of [[crisis in Venezuela]] since the 2010s, Roraima has become the leading entry point for [[Venezuelan refugee crisis|Venezuelan refugees]] in Brazil.

== Etymology ==
The word "{{lang|aoc|Roraima}}" comes from the [[Pemon language]]. Its etymology gives it three possible meanings: "Green Peak", "Mother of the Winds" and "Cashew Mountain".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Roraima: The paradise of the far north|url=http://www.wonderamazon.com/estado.php?sigla=rr|url-status=|access-date=April 8, 2011|website=Wonder Amazon|language=pt}}{{dead link|date=September 2023}}</ref> It would be the junction of ''roro'' ([[parrot]]) and ''imã'' (father, former).<ref>{{Cite web|date=2009|title=Território, Cultura e Regionalismo: Aspectos Geográficos em Símbolos Estaduais Brasileiros|url=http://www.athena.biblioteca.unesp.br/exlibris/bd/brc/33004137004P0/2009/berg_tj_me_rcla.pdf|access-date=February 14, 2016|publisher=Paulista State University Júlio de Mesquita Filho (UNESP) and Institute of Geosciences and Exact Sciences Campus of Rio Claro|language=pt}}</ref> In that language, {{lang|aoc|roro}}- or also {{lang|aoc|rora}}- means "green", and {{lang|aoc|imã}} means mountain or peak, thus forming the word "Green Peak", reflecting the natural landscape of that specific region.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2011|title=Estados brasileiros da Região Norte - Origem dos nomes|url=http://www.fernandodannemann.recantodasletras.com.br/visualizar.php?idt=521436|url-status=|access-date=February 14, 2016|publisher=Fernando Dannemann|language=pt}}{{dead link|date=September 2023}}</ref>

There is a possibility that the word "Roraima" has two other meanings: "Mother of the Winds" and "Cashew Mountain". The first meaning comes from the windy climate in the region, where indigenous people believed that the winds that blew through southern Venezuela came from that place. The second, "Cashew Mountain", is due to the many mountains and hills that exist in the area.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Notícias e conteúdos|url=http://www.cursoparaconcursos.com.br/index.php?modulo=eva_conteudo&acao=&subacao=&tipo=exibir&modo=item&it_cod=29232|url-status=|access-date=April 20, 2011|publisher=LFG|language=pt}}{{dead link|date=September 2023}}</ref>

== History ==
{{main|History of Roraima}}
The first [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] settlers arrived in the region by the [[Branco River]]. Before the arrival of the Portuguese, the [[English people|English]] and the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] were already attracted to the region, to explore the Branco River Valley through the [[The Guianas|Guyanas]]. [[Portugal]]'s sovereignty over the region was only established after the [[Spaniards]] invaded the northern part of the Branco River, along with the [[Uraricoera River]]. From 1725, [[Carmelites|Carmelite missionaries]] began the task of converting the [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous peoples]] in the region.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|title=A história de Roraima|url=http://www.roraimavirtual.com.br/historia_rr.htm|access-date=February 16, 2016|website=Roraima Virtual}}</ref>

The Portuguese occupation intensified from the 1730s when it traveled the Branco River in search of consolidation of the borders and indigenous labour. For this, they organized rescue troops (purchase of indigenous people transformed into slaves during wars of opposing ethnic groups), war troops (punishment and enslavement of indigenous people who attacked Portuguese nuclei or prevented evangelization) and the search for Brazilian products for sale, the so-called ''[[sertão]]'' drugs. Also, they promoted descents – villages of missionaries and indigenous volunteers or compulsory.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Filho|first=Gregório F.G.|date=2012|title=O Forte São Joaquim e a construção da fronteira no extremo norte: a ocupação portuguesa no vale do rio Branco (1775-1800)|url=http://coral.ufsm.br/ppgh/images/MESTRADO/dissertacoes/turma2011/Dissertacao-Gregorio-Ferreira%20-%202012.pdf|access-date=April 5, 2019|website=Dissertação de Mestrado|publisher=[[Federal University of Santa Maria]]}}</ref>
[[File:Boa Vista antiga 1.jpg|left|thumb|Aerial view of the [[Boa Vista, Roraima|Boa Vista]] region at the beginning of the 20th century.]]
In the middle of the 18th century, the [[List of Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese Crown]] became concerned with the constant Spanish expeditions to the western region of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]]. Thus, the idea of creating the Royal Captaincy of São José do Rio Negro was considered, which occurred through the Royal Charter of March 3, 1755. The main reason for the creation of the captaincy was the fear of the Spanish threat from the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], and the arising fear from the Dutch expeditions in [[Suriname]] to trade and imprison indigenous peoples.<ref name=":9">{{Cite web|date=2016-06-13|title=Roraima|url=https://www.portalsaofrancisco.com.br/turismo/roraima|access-date=2021-04-25|website=Portal São Francisco|language=pt}}</ref>

The demarcations foresaw by the [[Treaty of Madrid (13 January 1750)|Treaty of Madrid, of 1750]], also lead to a great extent: with the creation of a new administrative unit in the region, the intention was to implement, in practice, the colonization of the Upper [[Negro River (Amazon)|Negro River]], creating the necessary infrastructure for the meeting and the work of the Portuguese and Spanish demarcation committees, and this meeting never took place, having Portuguese moulds temporarily occupied the course of the lower Branco River in the meantime, carrying out plantations of [[manioc]] and other food, for the provisioning of the commission.<ref name=":9" />

The São Joaquim Fort, built in 1755 at the confluence of the Uraricoiera River with the [[Takutu River]], was decisive in the conquest of the Branco River by the Portuguese. The Fort, which no longer exists today, had the main purpose of providing the Portuguese with total sovereignty of Portugal over the lands of the Branco River Valley, which aroused international greed due to its little exploitation.<ref name=":8" />
[[File:Povoado de Nossa Senhora da Conceição (Roraima).jpg|thumb|Village of Nossa Senhora da Conceição according to Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira, late 18th century.]]
The Portuguese colonizers, after assuming sovereignty and total control of the region, created several villages and towns in the locality, together with indigenous natives. Nossa Senhora da Conceição and Santo Antônio, on the Uraricoera River; São Felipe, on the Takutu River and Nossa Senhora do Carmo and Santa Bárbara, on the Branco River, were the main settlements created at the time, housing a significant population number. However, due to the conflicts between the indigenous and the colonizers, because the indigenous people did not accept to submit to the conditions imposed by the Portuguese, the villages did not develop.<ref name=":8" />

To guarantee the presence of the Portuguese settlers in the lands of the Branco River Valley, commander Manuel da Gama Lôbo d'Almada started breeding cattle and horses in the territory, in 1789. The farms of São Bento, São José and São Marcos, on the Uraricoera and Takutu rivers, respectively, were the first to permanently introduce cattle and equine breeding, between 1793 and 1799. Currently, the São Marcos farm belongs to the indigenous people and is located in front of the place where Fort São Joaquim was located.<ref name=":8" />
[[File:Centro cívico de Boa Vista.jpg|thumb|Centre of Boa Vista]]
For a year, between 1810 and 1811, English soldiers entered the Valley but were expelled by the commander of São Joaquim Fort. The border between [[Brazil]] and [[Guyana]], whose border demarcation process had already been closed, needed to be re-marked, due to the great English invasions that occurred in that period.<ref name=":8" /> Therefore, the colonization of the Branco River was divided into four periods: From 1750 to the beginning of the 19th century, with the discovery of the Branco River; from the mid-19th century until the creation of the municipality of [[Boa Vista, Roraima|Boa Vista]], in 1890; from 1890 until the creation of the Federal Territory of Rio Branco; and the creation of the Federal Territory of Rio Branco to elevate it to the category of Brazilian federative unit renamed Roraima.<ref name=":8" />

Decree-Law No. 5,812 of September 13, 1943, which dismembered the state of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]], created the Federal Territory of Rio Branco. In 1962, the territory was called the Federal Territory of Roraima and elevated to the category of Brazilian federative unit by the [[Brazilian Constitution of 1988]].<ref name=":9" />

The colonization of the region was highly encouraged at the end of the 19th century, with the establishment of National Farms. However, the state's population only found stability after its emancipation, a century later, with the gold and diamond mines that attracted migratory waves from different regions of the country. This disorderly immigration and exploitation resulted in many conflicts and deaths due to illnesses and murders in the locality.<ref name=":9" /> Currently, almost all of the state's [[Lands inhabited by indigenous peoples|indigenous reserves]] are approved.<ref name=":9" />

[[File:Brazil Roraima relief map.jpg|thumb|Topographic map of Roraima.]]
Roraima is a state in the [[North Region, Brazil|North Region of Brazil]], being the northernmost state in the [[Federative Republic of Brazil]]. It has 1,922 kilometres of border with South American countries. It is bordered by the state of [[Pará]] to the southeast for 107&nbsp;km, [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]] to the south and west for about 1,200&nbsp;km partly across the Jufari, Jauaperi and Alalau rivers, [[Venezuela]] to the north and northwest for 1,403&nbsp;km across the Serra Parima and north across the Serra Pacaraima, and [[Guyana]] to the east for 964&nbsp;km.<ref name=":1" /> Roraima covers an area of approximately {{convert|223644.527|km2|-2|abbr=in}},<ref name=":0" /> slightly larger than [[Belarus]], being the [[List of Brazilian states by area|fourteenth largest Brazilian state by area]].<ref name=":2" />

=== Relief ===
[[Mount Roraima]], located in [[Pacaraima Mountains]], is the highest point in the state and one of the highest in the country, with {{convert|2,875|m|-2|abbr=in}}. The relief in the state is quite varied. Near the borders of Venezuela and Guyana are the mountains of [[Parima Mountains|Parima]] and [[Pacaraima Mountains|Pacaraima]], where [[Mount Roraima]] is located, with an altitude of {{convert|2,875|m|-2|abbr=in}}. As it is in the far north of Brazil, its points in the far north are the [[Uailan River]] and Mount Caburaí.<ref name=":4" />

Roraima is predominantly flat. About 60% of the area is below {{convert|200|m|-2|abbr=in}}, about 25% averages between 200 and 300 metres, 14% from 300 to 900 metres and only 1% has elevations over 900 metres above [[sea level]]. There are also two [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] structures: the Wavy Plateau and the Northern Escarpments, which are part of the [[Guiana Shield]]. Its Wavy Plateau is a large pediplain, formed by isolated and dispersed massifs and peaks.<ref name=":4" />

Because of its variations, the relief is divided into five degrees: The first-degree houses areas of the state that can be flooded, which do not have a specific form of relief, but which are covered by a thin layer of water; the second degree would be the [[Branco River]] pediplain, an important unit of enormous expression in the state since it occupies a large part of its lands. In this pediplain, the altitudes vary from 70 to 160 metres and have a low slope towards the river channels. The third degree is formed by elevations that can reach an altitude of 400 metres.<ref name=":4" /> There are mountain ranges such as Serra da Lua, Serra Grande, Serra da Batata and others. The fourth degree is characterized by elevations that can vary from 600 to 2,000 metres of altitude, formed mainly by the [[Pacaraima Mountains|Pacaraima mountain range]], [[Parima Mountains|Serra do Parima]] and Serra do Urucuzeiro. These mountains are joined in the form of chains and the rivers that form the [[Uraricoera River|Uraricoera river]] are born there. Finally, the fifth degree, groups the highest regions, formed by elevations that reach almost 3,000 metres of altitude.<ref name=":4" />

=== Hydrography ===
[[File:Rio Branco sul.JPG|left|thumb|Branco River, near Boa Vista.]]
The state of Roraima has extensive hydrography. Its territory is abundantly irrigated by 14 rivers, being these: [[Água Boa do Univini River|Água Boa do Univiní]], [[Ailã River|Ailã]], [[Ajarani River|Ajarani]], [[Alalaú River|Alalaú]], [[Branco River|Branco]], [[Catrimani River|Catrimani]], [[Cauamé River|Cauamé]], [[Itapará River|Itapará]], [[Mucajaí River|Mucajaí]], [[Surumu River|Surumu]], [[Takutu River|Takutu]], [[Uraricoera River|Uraricoera]], [[Urubu River (Amazonas)|Urubu]] and [[Xeruini River|Xeruini]].<ref name=":10">{{Cite web|title=Aspectos naturais de Roraima - Hidrografia|url=https://brasilescola.uol.com.br/brasil/aspectos-naturais-roraima.htm|access-date=2021-04-25|website=Brasil Escola|language=pt-br}}</ref>

The hydrography of Roraima is part of the [[Amazon River Basin|Amazon River basin]] and is basically based on the Branco River sub-basin of {{convert|45,530|km2|-2|abbr=in}}, the largest and most important in the state. This river is one of the tributaries of the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Negro River]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bacias hidrográficas|url=http://www.portalroraima.rr.gov.br/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=92&itemid=1|url-status=|access-date=March 16, 2011|publisher=Portal do Governo do Estado de Roraima}}{{dead link|date=September 2023}}</ref>

Most of the rivers in the region have a large number of [[beach]]es in the summer, ideal for tourism and leisure. Besides, there are rapids rivers located in the north of the state, which are an option for water sports, such as [[canoeing]]. Almost all water sources in the state originate within its territory, except for two rivers with springs in [[Guyana]]. All Roraiman rivers flow into the [[Amazon basin|Amazon Basin]].<ref name=":10" />

On the beaches of the lower Branco River, it is still possible to find species of [[turtle]]s, such as the ''[[yellow-spotted river turtle]]''. There are many species of birds in the state, from large to small ones. Among the large ones, the ''passarão'' (literally big bird) and the ''[[jabiru]]'' stand out. Among the small ones, ''[[Guan (bird)|guans]], [[heron]]s, [[crested caracara]]'' and others stand out.<ref name=":29" />

[[File:Savanas de Roraima.jpg|thumb|Lavrado region.]]
In Roraima, the flora is divided into three regions:

* Amazon rainforest ''(Floresta tropical amazônica)'': composed of dense and humid forest typical of the lower Branco River, extending through the southwest region.<ref name=":29" />
* General fields of the Branco River ''(Campos Gerais do Rio Branco)'': approximately {{cvt|44,000|km2}}, also known as the lavrado region. Lavrado is also known as the savannah. Formed by [[Poaceae|grass-plot]], but along the watercourses, called ''igarapés'', there are large [[Arecaceae|palm trees]] known as [[Mauritia flexuosa|''buritizeiros'']]. In the lavrado there are also, in great quantity, bushes, paricaranas and muricizeiros.<ref name=":29" />
* Mountainous region ''(Região Serrana)'': with typical mountainous vegetation, thinner trees and valleys rich in [[humus]] with good-quality grass for livestock.<ref name=":29" />

In any of the regions, there are three different types of vegetation cover taking into account the river banks. These are:

* Mainland forests ''(Matas de terra firme)'': comprising forests located in lands never affected by river floods.<ref name=":29" />
* Floodplain forests ''(Matas de várzeas)'': these are the forests that cover the lands affected by the floods of rivers.<ref name=":29" />
* Riparian forests ''(Matas ciliares)'': these are preserved by law and are also flooded every year by river floods.<ref name=":29" />

Cultural, political and economic traits inherited from the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] are influential in Roraima. Also, the importance of the [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous peoples]] in terms of ethnic contribution cannot be forgotten. It was the indigenous people who initiated human occupation in the [[Amazon basin|Amazon region]], and their descendants, the ''[[caboclo]]s'', developed in close contact with the environment, adapting to the regional peculiarities and opportunities offered by the forest.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ensaios sobre a riqueza do pensamento ameríndio|url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rbcsoc/v18n51/15992.pdf|access-date=March 17, 2011|publisher=Scielo}}</ref>

In its historical formation, the Roraiman demography is the result of the [[miscegenation]] of the three basic ethnic groups that make up the population in the state: the Indigenous, the Europeans and the Africans, thus forming the mestizos of the region (''[[caboclo]]s'').

With a [[Gross domestic product|Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) of only [[Brazilian real|R$]] 13,37 billion, the economy of the state of Roraima is the [[List of Brazilian federative units by gross regional product|smallest in Brazil]], corresponding to only 0.2% of Brazil's economy. It is based on [[agricultural production]], mainly in grain [[agribusiness]], with emphasis on [[rice]], [[soybean]]s and [[maize|corn]]. It is said that the state works in the so-called "paycheck economy", when there is a circulation mainly of the amounts paid in salaries to public servants and private employees of commerce.<ref name=":16">{{Cite book|last=Freitas|first=Aimberê|title=História e Geografia de Roraima: Boa Vista|publisher=Luiz Aimberê Soares de Freitas|year=2017|isbn=9788563211057|pages=212}}</ref>

In [[livestock]], the [[live cattle trade]] for slaughter in [[Manaus]] was, until the 1970s, the main economic base. For years, between 6 and 10 thousand oxen were traded with Manaus annually. This type of trade brought [[foodstuff]]s, [[clothing]], [[Household hardware|household items]], among others, to Roraima. This form of supply ended due to two main factors: [[population growth]] in the state, through the inauguration of the [[BR-174|Manaus–Boa Vista Road]], and the decrease in the cattle herd.<ref name=":16" /><ref name=":17">{{Cite book|last=Migueis|first=Roberto|title=Geografia do Amazonas: Manaus|year=2018|isbn=9788575128749|pages=144|publisher=Editora Valer }}</ref>

Rice took the place of meat, starting to be traded with Manaus in the late 1970s. In 1977, [[Agricultural technology|agricultural mechanization]] for rice crop was introduced, increasing production capacity. In the beginning, mechanization was applied in the area of plowing for the production of [[upland rice]], which did not have the success expected by several factors. One of them was the lack of physical structure for storing production, as there were no dryers and warehouses. However, this system made it possible to shift production to irrigated rice. With more capitalized producers and government support in the construction of warehouses and dryers, production became viable. This type of rice came to be produced in the floodplains of the [[Branco River|Branco]], [[Takutu River|Takutu]], [[Uraricoera River|Uraricoera]] and [[Cauamé River|Cauamé]] rivers, with productivity high enough to cover the high costs of implanting and maintaining this crop in Roraima.<ref name=":16" /><ref name=":17" />

Subsequently, the cultivation of soybeans appeared in the plowing, with the planted area being increased year by year. The biggest problems of this crop are in the area of guaranteeing land tenure, its incompatibilities with environmental laws, in addition to irregularity and poor reliability of transport. These two largest crops in Roraima decreased with the conquest by the peoples from the Demarcation of the [[Raposa Serra do Sol|Raposa Serra do Sol Indigenous Area]].<ref name=":16" /><ref name=":17" />

Other crops such as corn, [[cassava]] and beans are also present. But they do not reach the level of rice and soy production. In the case of [[manioc]] for the production of [[flour]], Roraima is self-sufficient. In the area of fruit growing, [[pineapple]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[banana]], [[papaya]], [[melon]], [[watermelon]], [[grape]], [[lemon]], [[Passion fruit (fruit)|passion fruit]] and [[tangerine]] are produced in the state. The melon, watermelon and papaya stand out for their quality recognition. There has been great progress with vegetables in recent years. The production of [[lettuce]], [[green onions]], [[parsley]], peppers, [[sweet potato]]es, [[string beans]], [[pumpkin]], [[cabbage]] and [[Bell pepper|sweet pepper]] have increased, and it can be said that there is also self-sufficiency in this sector. Greenhouse production has helped in this process.<ref name=":16" /><ref name=":17" />
[[File:Brazil_nuts.jpg|thumb|Brazil nuts after shell removal]]
Roraima has always occupied a secondary position in the economic geography of the Amazon when it comes to plant extractivism, producing [[Brazil nut]]s, [[rowanberries]] and [[wood]]. The first two in the southern region of the state, especially under the [[Branco River]]. They are sold in Manaus, but on a small scale. The wood has been explored and traded with [[Venezuela]] and, more recently, with other countries in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].<ref name=":16" /><ref name=":17" />

The Roraiman industry is small. In the Industrial District of Boa Vista, located on the edge of the [[BR-174]], there were 58 plants in operation in 2015. They produce cereals, wood, leather, and others. The [[commercial sector]] is traditional, buying from other places, such as [[São Paulo]] and Manaus, and reselling in Boa Vista and other municipalities.<ref name=":16" /><ref name=":17" />

Getting closer commercially with neighboring countries to practice [[International trade|foreign trade]] is a path that has been recently traced. The main trading partner for exports and imports is Venezuela; the main product exported in 2004 and 2010 was wood; in 2015, there was a good diversification with the export of soy, leather and [[mineral water]], in addition to wood. The products imported in greater quantity have been machines, devices and mechanical instruments. The municipalities that export the most are Boa Vista, Bonfim, Caracaraí, Mucajaí and Rorainópolis.<ref name=":16" /><ref name=":17" />

Roraima is politically divided into [[List of municipalities in Roraima|15 municipalities]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2007-10-28|title=Estado de Roraima - Brasil|url=http://www.brasilrepublica.com/roraima.htm|access-date=2021-04-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028113632/http://www.brasilrepublica.com/roraima.htm|archive-date=28 October 2007}}</ref> The most populous of them is [[Boa Vista, Roraima|Boa Vista]], with 419,652 inhabitants,<ref name=":18" /> being the oldest municipality in the state, emerged as a village, the first with urban characteristics in Roraima.<ref>{{Cite web|title=História de Boa Vista|url=http://www.cidadebrasileira.brasilescola.com/roraima/historia-boa-vista.htm|access-date=March 22, 2011|publisher=Brasil Escola}}</ref> The municipalities are distributed in four immediate geographical regions, which in turn are grouped into two intermediate geographical regions, according to the division of the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE) in force since 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017|title=Divisão Regional do Brasil|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/geociencias/geografia/default_div_int.shtm|url-status=|website=IBGE}}{{dead link|date=September 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|year=1990|title=Biblioteca IBGE|url=http://biblioteca.ibge.gov.br/visualizacao/livros/liv2269_1.pdf|journal=|publisher=IBGE|volume=1|access-date=September 25, 2017}}</ref>

== Transportation ==

=== Airways ===
[[File:Gate de embarque do Aeroporto Internacional de Boa Vista em julho de 2018.jpg|thumb|Boarding gate of Boa Vista International Airport.]]
In the state, there is only one [[international airport]] managed by [[Infraero]], [[Boa Vista International Airport|Boa Vista International Airport - Atlas Brasil Cantanhede]], located in the state capital.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Infraero Aeroportos - Roraima|url=http://www.infraero.gov.br/index.php/br/aeroportos/roraima/aeroporto-internacional-de-boa-vista.html|url-status=|access-date=March 31, 2011}}{{dead link|date=September 2023}}</ref> In 2009, the airport in the state capital handled 190,469 passengers and 931,248 [[air cargo]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Movimento Operacional|url=http://www.infraero.gov.br/index.php/br/aeroportos/roraima/aeroporto-internacional-de-boa-vista/movimento-operacional.html|url-status=|access-date=March 31, 2011}}{{dead link|date=September 2023}}</ref> The state also has 7 other state-class and smaller airports: Auaris Airport, in [[Amajari]]; Mucajaí Airport, in [[Mucajaí]]; Pacaraima Airport, in [[Pacaraima]]; Surucucu, Uaicas and Surucucus Airport, in [[Alto Alegre, Roraima|Alto Alegre]], the latter located inside the [[Yanomami Indigenous Territory]]; and Caracaraí Airport, in [[Caracaraí]]. These airports are of municipal and state administration.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Aeroportos no Estado de Roraima - Aeroportos públicos homologados pela ANAC em Roraima|url=http://www.emsampa.com.br/warrr.htm|access-date=2021-05-02|website=www.emsampa.com.br}}</ref>

Air transport is the fastest to regulate in Roraima, being in better conditions than the others. The cities, districts and towns of the inland of Roraima are served, in most cases, by transport from [[Boa Vista, Roraima|Boa Vista]]. That said, it is the most isolated federative unit in Brazil.<ref name=":25" /> There is no [[rail network]] in the state.<ref name=":25" />

=== Highways ===
[[File:Mapa Rodoviário RR - detalhado.png|thumb|Road map of Roraima.]]
The only Brazilian state that has a road connection with Roraima is [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]], through the [[BR-174]], which connects the municipalities in the South to the municipalities in the North of the state, and is also responsible for connecting Brazil to [[Venezuela]]. The BR-174 is {{convert|992|km|-2|abbr=out}} long and crosses the territory of the state from south to north, crossing the [[Branco River]] at the height of Caracaraí through the Caracaraí Bridge.<ref name=":25" /><ref name=":27">{{Cite web|date=2011-07-07|title=Roraima - Características Físicas e Humanas --> [Estradas e Transportes]|url=http://www.roraima.8m.com/eet.html|access-date=2021-05-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707070519/http://www.roraima.8m.com/eet.html|archive-date=7 July 2011}}</ref>

There is also the [[BR-210]], also called Perimetral Norte, a project originating in the mid-twentieth century, from the [[Federal government of Brazil|Federal Government]], which had been carried out only partially and which, in principle, would link the state to [[Pará]], [[Amapá]] and the municipality of [[São Gabriel da Cachoeira]] (in Amazonas). This highway is {{convert|481|km|-2|abbr=out}} long and crosses the state in an east–west direction. Another highway in Roraima that crosses Brazil is the [[BR-401]], connecting the state with [[Guyana]]. It starts in Boa Vista and crosses the Branco River through the Macuxis' Bridge, entering the Guyanese territory. Other federal highways are BR-431, BR-432 and BR-433. Federal roads in Roraima add up to {{convert|1,638|km|-2|abbr=out}}.<ref name=":25" /><ref name=":27" />

There are state highways as well, including the RR-205 (which connects the capital to the headquarters of [[Alto Alegre, Roraima|Alto Alegre]]) and the RR-203 (connecting the headquarters and districts of Amajari to the BR-174), both of which are fully paved, signposted, and with good traffic conditions. Other important highways are the RR-325 and the RR-319, which cut through important agricultural areas and colonies of rural settlements. State highways add up to just over {{convert|2,000|km|-2|abbr=out}} in length and are largely in conditions of improper use.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Municípios de Roraima|url=http://www.roraima-brasil.com.br/pt/roraima/municipios/alto_alegre/|url-status=|access-date=February 4, 2012}}{{dead link|date=September 2023}}</ref><ref name=":27" />

=== Waterways ===
[[File:Ponte dos Macuxis, Boa Vista.jpg|thumb|The Macuxis' Bridge crossing the Branco River.]]
River transport is also notable in the state, as well as in other states in the [[Amazon rainforest]]. However, river navigation is limited to the [[Branco River]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Roraima (RR) - BrasilChannel.com.br|url=https://www.brasilchannel.com.br/estados/index.asp?nome=Roraima&area=quadro-natural|access-date=2021-05-02|website=www.brasilchannel.com.br}}</ref> Transportation on the Branco River is heavily used for the economy, but with little passenger movement to inland cities. Regular navigation on this river occurs only in the mouth section (Negro River/Caracaraí), about {{convert|440|km|-2|abbr=out}} long. In this segment, the Branco River has a maximum draft of 5 metres in the period of floods and a minimum of 0.7 metres in the period of drought. Roraima is at a disadvantage in relation to the other Amazonian states in terms of waterway system. As it is the only one in which all its notorious rivers have their source in their own territory – the state's hydrographic system is 100% Roraiman –, it is bound to have few river outlets. In fact, Roraima has only one major fluvial outlet: through the Branco river, reaching the Negro river, heading from there to [[Manaus]] and [[São Gabriel da Cachoeira]]. Even so, the most important river in Roraima still poses additional difficulties.<ref name=":27" />

== Tourism ==
Roraima has great tourism potential, especially in [[ecotourism]]. Because it is located in the extreme north of Brazil, in the northern part of this country and because it borders on three South American countries, Roraima maintains close commercial relations based on tourism with these countries, especially [[Venezuela]]. Natural attractions are the main tourist points of the state, especially [[Mount Roraima]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Roraima Adventures {{!}} Turismo de Aventura|url=https://roraimaadventures.com.br/|access-date=2021-05-02|website=Roraima Adventures {{!}} Turismo de Aventura|language=pt-BR}}</ref> Mount Roraima is one of the oldest places on the planet and attracts many tourists from all over the world.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Venha ao Místico Monte Roraima|url=http://www.turismo.rr.gov.br/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=18&Itemid=28|url-status=|access-date=April 7, 2011|publisher=Secretaria de Planejamento e Desenvolvimento de Roraima (SEPLAN)}}{{dead link|date=September 2023}}</ref>
[[File:Pedra pintada frente.jpg|left|thumb|Pedra Pintada is a rock formation considered an archaeological site.]]
Archaeologists have a strong interest in [[Pedra Pintada, Roraima|Pedra Pintada]], which is the most important site of [[archaeology]] in the state. In it, there are inscriptions of ancient civilizations, such as rock paintings, pieces of ceramics, hatchets, necklace beads, among other artifacts that indicate the history of human evolution, dating back to four thousand years. The rock is a granite monolith sixty metres in diameter and about 40 metres high. On the outer face, there are red rock paintings that are still considered an enigma for scientists. There are also funerary caves up to 12 meters long. Pedra Pintada is located in [[Pacaraima]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Serviço - Sitio Arqueológico Pedra Pintada|url=http://www.institutoestradareal.com.br/servico/detalhe/atrativo/Sitio-Arqueologico-Pedra-Pintada/1012|access-date=2021-05-02|website=www.institutoestradareal.com.br}}</ref>

Serra do Tepequém is also a state tourist attraction. It has a rich handicraft in [[soapstone]] and its area is free to explore diamonds. The place serves as a trekking practice, to the Paiva, Sobral, Barata and Funil waterfalls. The plateau is the culmination of the entire mountain, where the [[mountain range]] that delimits the [[Brazil–Venezuela border|borders between Brazil and Venezuela]] begins. It has an average altitude of 1,500 metres and is located in the municipality of [[Amajari]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Serra do Tepequém|url=http://www.turismo.rr.gov.br/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=19&Itemid=31|url-status=|publisher=Secretaria de Planejamento e Desenvolvimento de Roraima (SEPLAN)}}{{dead link|date=September 2023}}</ref> Another tourist spot in the state is [[Monte Caburaí|Mount Caburaí]]. Geographers have proven that it is located 70&nbsp;km north of [[Oiapoque]], [[Amapá]], which makes the mountain the northernmost point in Brazil, having been recognized by the official institutions responsible for geographic territorial demarcations, such as the [[Ministry of Education (Brazil)|Ministry of Education]] and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Monte Caburaí|url=http://www.turismo.rr.gov.br/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=20&Itemid=34|url-status=|access-date=April 7, 2011|publisher=Secretaria de Planejamento e Desenvolvimento de Roraima (SEPLAN)}}{{dead link|date=September 2023}}</ref>

Also noteworthy is [[Lake Caracaranã]], in the municipality of [[Normandia, Roraima|Normandia]]. With almost 6 kilometres of [[perimeter]], it is known for its fine sand beaches surrounded by [[cashew tree]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|last=RR|first=Emily CostaDo G1|date=2014-04-10|title=Em RR, lago Caracaranã ficará aberto à visitação neste fim de semana|url=http://g1.globo.com/rr/roraima/noticia/2014/04/em-rr-lago-caracarana-ficara-aberto-visitacao-neste-fim-de-semana.html|access-date=2021-05-02|website=Roraima|language=pt-br}}</ref>
