=== Medieval history ===
During the [[early Muslim conquests]], the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] city was captured in 640 by the Muslim commander [[Iyad ibn Ghanm]].<ref name=":7">{{EI2|volume=6|article=Mārdīn|last1=Minorsky|first1=V.|first2=C.E.|last2=Bosworth|pages=539–542}}</ref><ref name=":8">{{Cite web |last=Taştemir |first=Mehmet |date=2003 |title=MARDİN |url=https://islamansiklopedisi.org.tr/mardin |access-date=2022-12-19 |website=TDV İslâm Ansiklopedisi |pages=48–51 (in print edition) |language=tr}}</ref> In many periods control of the city changed hands frequently between different dynasties. [[Hamdan ibn Hamdun]] captured the city in 885 and it remained under intermittent [[Hamdanid dynasty|Hamdanid]] control until the second half of the 10th century, at which point it became contested between the [[Marwanids (Diyar Bakr)|Marwanids]] and the [[Uqaylids]], with the Marwanids probably holding the upper hand over this area.<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":8" /> Marwanid control in the region was ended by the arrival of the Great Seljuks under [[Malik-Shah I]] in 1085, which inaugurated an era of Turkish political domination and immigration in the region.<ref name=":8" />

From 1103 onwards, Mardin served as the capital of one of the two main branches of the [[Artuqid dynasty]], an [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] Turkish family who had earlier fought alongside the Seljuks.<ref name=":9">{{Cite book |last=Bosworth |first=Clifford Edmund |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKpz_2CkoWEC&q=new+islamic+dynasties |title=The New Islamic Dynasties: A Chronological and Genealogical Manual |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |year=2004 |isbn=9780748696482 |location= |pages= |chapter=The Artuqids}}</ref><ref name=":8" /> Many of Mardin's major historic buildings were constructed under Artuqid control, including several [[mosque]]s and [[madrasa]]s, along with other types of [[Islamic architecture]].<ref name=":2" /> The lands of the Artukid dynasty fell to the [[Mongol invasion]] sometime between 1235 and 1243, but the Artuqids submitted to Mongol khan [[Hülegü]] and continued to govern as vassals of the [[Mongol Empire]].<ref>Ed. Morris Rossabi. ''China among equals: the Middle Kingdom and its neighbors, 10th–14th centuries'', p. 244</ref><ref name=":9" />

When [[Timur]] invaded the region in 1394, the local Artuqid ruler, 'Isā, submitted to [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]] suzerainty, but the region continued to be disputed between different powers.<ref name=":7" /> The last Artuqid ruler, al-Salih, finally yielded the city to [[Qara Yusuf]], the leader of [[Qara Qoyunlu]], in 1408–9, and left for [[Mosul]].<ref name=":9" /><ref name=":7" /> The city continued to be contested between the Qara Qoyunlu and their rivals, the Timurid-allied [[Aq Qoyunlu]].<ref name=":7" /> In 1451 the Qara Qoyunlu besieged the city after it had been captured by the Aq Qoyunlu, but failed to retake the stronghold. Aq Qoyunlu rule thus continued in the city for the rest of the 15th century.<ref name=":8" /> Coins were struck here under the rule of [[Uzun Hasan]] and his son, [[Yaqub Aq Qoyunlu|Ya'qub]].<ref name=":7" /> After Ya'qub, Aq Qoyunlu rule began to fragment, but Mardin remained the center of an independent Aq Qoyunlu principality for many years, while the Safavids in the east grew stronger.<ref>{{EI2|volume=1|article=Aḳ Ḳoyunlu|last1=Minorsky|first1=V.|pages=311–312}}</ref> In 1507, the Safavid ruler [[Ismail I]] succeeded in capturing the city and the castle, expelling the local Aq Qoyunlu ruler.<ref name="Mardin-IE">{{cite web |url=http://www.islamansiklopedisi.info/dia/ayrmetin.php?idno=280045 |title=MARDİN |author=Mehmet Taştemir |publisher=İslam Ansiklopedisi [Islamic Encyclopedia] |page=45 |access-date=29 September 2018 |language=tr |archive-date=29 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929194734/http://www.islamansiklopedisi.info/dia/ayrmetin.php?idno=280045 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":7" />

During the medieval period, the town retained significant [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] and [[Armenian people|Armenian]] populations and became the centre for [[episcopal see]]s of [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]], [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholic]], [[Assyrian Church of the East|Church of the East]], [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac Catholic]], churches, as well as a stronghold of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], whose [[patriarchal see]] was headquartered in the nearby [[Mor Hananyo Monastery|Saffron Monastery]] from 1034 to 1924.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cinti Migliarini |first1=Anita |title=La chiesa siriaca di Antiochia |url=http://www.chiesa-siro-ortodossa.ch/chi_siamo.html |website=Chiesa siro-ortodossa di Antiochia |access-date=1 March 2016 |language=it |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313092059/http://www.chiesa-siro-ortodossa.ch/chi_siamo.html |archive-date=13 March 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> A Venetian merchant who visited the town in 1507 wrote that there were still more Christian Armenians and [[Jews]] in the city than Muslims.<ref name=":7" />

=== Ottoman Empire ===
[[File:Merdin - Peeters Jacob - 1690.jpg|thumb|left|[[Engraving]] of Mardin by Jacob Peeters ([[Flemish people|Flemish]] traveler) in 1690]]After the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] victory against their bitter rivals, the Safavids, at the [[Battle of Chaldiran]] in 1514, the balance of power in the region changed. The Safavid commander in the region, Ustajlu, was killed in the battle with the Ottomans and was replaced by his brother, Kara Khan (or Karahan). In 1515 Mardin briefly yielded to the Ottomans, but the castle remained under Safavid control and the Ottomans were forced to leave after a few days, leaving Kara Khan to re-occupy it.<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":7" /> The following year, the Ottoman commander, Bıyıklı Mehmed Pasha, defeated Kara Khan and Safavid control in the region crumbled. The Ottomans besieged Mardin again, which resisted under the command of Kara Khan's brother, Sulayman Khan. After the [[Battle of Marj Dabiq]] in August 1516, Bıyıklı Mehmed Pasha returned with reinforcements from Syria and finally forced the city's surrender in late 1516 or early 1517.<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":7" /> After this, Mardin was administered by a [[Vali (governor)|governor]] directly appointed under the [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Sultan's authority]].

The city experienced a relatively tranquil period under Ottoman rule, without any significant conflicts or plights. European travelers who visited the city in the late 18th and early 19th centuries gave highly variable estimates of the population, but generally indicate that Muslims (or "Turks") were the largest group, with sizeable [[Armenians|Armenian]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] communities and other minorities, while [[Arabic]] and [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] were the predominant languages.<ref name=":7" />

The period of peace was finally halted when the [[Ottoman Empire]] came into conflict with the [[Khedivate of Egypt]]. During this time the city came under the rule of insurgents associated with the Kurdish Milli clan. In 1835, the Milli tribe was subdued by the military troops of the [[Wāli#Ottoman Empire term|Wāli]] of [[Diyarbekir Eyalet]], [[Reşid Mehmed Pasha]].<ref name=":0222">{{Cite book |last1=Aydın |first1=Suavi |title=Social Relations in Ottoman Diyarbekir, 1870-1915 |last2=Verheij |first2=Jelle |publisher=Brill |year=2012 |isbn=9789004225183 |editor-last=Jorngerden |editor-first=Joost |pages=31 |editor-last2=Verheij |editor-first2=Jelle}}</ref> During the siege the city's Great Mosque was blown up.<ref name=":7" /> Between 1847 and 1865 the city's population suffered from a notable [[cholera]] epidemic, with the exact number of fatalities not known.<ref name="Mardin-IE" /> During [[World War I]] Mardin was one of the sites of the [[Assyrian genocide|Assyrian]] and [[Armenian genocide]]s.

=== Modern history ===
In 1923, with the founding of the Republic of Turkey, Mardin was made the administrative capital of a [[Mardin Province|province]] named after it. Many Assyrian survivors of the violence, later on, left Mardin for nearby [[Qamishli]] in the 1940s after their conscription in the [[Turkish Army]] became compulsory.<ref name=":0" /> As the Turkish Government subdued the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] [[Sheikh Said rebellion]] in 1925, the first and the fourteenth cavalry division were stationed in Mardin.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Olson |first=Robert |title=The Emergence of Kurdish Nationalism and the Sheikh Said Rebellion, 1880–1925 |date=1989 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=0292776195 |pages=102–104 |language=en}}</ref>

== Geography ==
The city is located near the Syrian border and is the center of Mardin province. The old city is built mostly on the southern slope of a long hill topped by a rocky ridge. The slope descends towards the [[Mesopotamia]]n plain. The top of the ridge is occupied by the city's historic [[Mardin Castle|citadel]].<ref name=":2" /> The newer parts of the city are located on lower ground to the northwest and in the surrounding area and feature modern amenities and institutions.<ref name=":3" /> [[Mardin Airport]] is located to the southwest, {{Convert|20|km|mi}} from the old town.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Darke|first=Diana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U9WwsQE6AJ4C&dq=mardin+airport+guide&pg=PA245|title=Bradt Travel Guide - Eastern Turkey|date=2011|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-339-9|language=en}}</ref>

== Ecclesiastical history ==
A bishopric of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] was centered on the town when it was part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Assyria (Roman province)|Assyria]]. It was a [[suffragan]] see of [[Edessa]], the provincial [[metropolitan see]]. It eventually became part of the [[Catholic Church]] in the late 17th century AD following a breakaway from the Assyrian Church, and is the (nominal) seat of three sees of the Catholic Church: the current [[Chaldean Catholic Eparchy of Mardin]] and two (now) [[titular see]]s under the ancient name of the town:<ref name=AP>'' Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice, 2013, {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 923</ref> former [[Armenian Catholic Archeparchy of Mardin]], now Titular see of Mardin only, and former [[Syriac Catholic Eparchy of Mardin and Amida]], now titular see (initially as mere Eparchy).

== Historical landmarks ==
Mardin has often been considered an open-air museum due to its historical architecture. Most buildings use the beige colored limestone rock which has been mined for centuries in quarries around the area.

=== Mosques and madrasas ===
[[File:Mardin Ulu Cami DSCF0534.jpg|thumb|Great Mosque of Mardin]]
[[File:Sultan Isa Medrese DSCF9680.jpg|thumb|The [[Sultan Isa Medrese|Sultan Isa or Zincirye Medrese]]]]
* Great Mosque (''Ulu Cami'') of Mardin: The historic main [[congregational mosque]] of the city, probably first built in the 1170s under the Artuqids. It was destroyed by artillery explosions during Rashid Pasha's siege of the city in the early 19th-century and rebuilt afterwards, probably along similar lines as the original building. Only the north wall of the original mosque remains. The original Artuqid ''minbar'' (pulpit), made of wood, has also survived. An inscription on the base of the minaret records its original construction date as 1176, but most of the minaret above the base was rebuilt circa 1892, probably well after the reconstruction of the prayer hall.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=Sinclair|first=Thomas Alan|title=Eastern Turkey: an architectural and archaeological survey|publisher=The Pindar Press|year=1989|isbn=0907132340|volume=III}}</ref>
* [[Sultan Isa Medrese|Sultan İsa (or Zinciriye) Medrese]]: One of the most impressive Islamic monuments in the city, dated to 1385, during the reign of Artuqid sultan Al-Zahir Majd al-Din 'Isa (r. 1376–1407). Built as a madrasa, it also includes a mosque (prayer hall) and a mausoleum, arranged around two inner courtyards. The mausoleum was likely intended to be Sultan 'Isā's burial site, but he was never buried here after his death in battle. It has an imposing entrance portal carved with ''[[muqarnas]]'', and two ribbed domes over the mausoleum and the mosque that are visible on the city's skyline.<ref name=":2" />
* [[Kasımiye Medrese|Kasım Pasha (or Kasımiye) Medrese]]: Another major Islamic monument begun by Sultan 'Isa but left unfinished upon his death in 1407. It was completed in 1445, under Akkoyonlu rule. It is located to the west, just outside of the town. It has a large central courtyard, a monumental portal, and three domes arranged near the front façade.<ref name=":7" />
* Emineddin Külliyesi: A ''[[külliye]]'' (religious and charitable complex), believed to be the oldest Islamic monument in the city, founded by Emin ed-Din, the brother of Sultan [[Ilghazi|Najm ad-Din Il-Ghazi]] (r. 1115–1122). Il-Ghazi may have finished the complex after his brother's death. The complex contains a mosque, a former madrasa, a fountain, and a [[hammam]] (bathhouse).<ref name=":2" />
* El-Asfar Mosque: Believed to be the remains of a former madrasa known as the Necmeddin Medrese (Nahm ad-Din Madrasa). According to tradition, sultan Najm ad-Din Il-Ghazi was buried here, placing its foundation to the early 12th century, although only parts of the original building remain.<ref name=":2" />
* Şehidiye Mosque: Originally a madrasa, probably built in the reign of Artuqid sultan Najm ad-Din Ghazi (r. 1239–1260) or earlier. Heavily restored in 1787–88. The minaret was rebuilt in 1916–17.<ref name=":2" />
* Latifiye Mosque: An Artuqid mosque dated to 1371, with a minaret added in 1845.<ref name=":2" />
* Şeyh Çabuk Mosque: A mosque of uncertain date, built no later than the 15th century (the Akkoyonlu period) and restored in the 19th century.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=ŞEYH ÇABUK CAMİİ|url=http://www.kulturportali.gov.tr/turkiye/mardin/gezilecekyer/seyh-cabuk-camii|access-date=2022-01-15|website=Kültür Portalı}}</ref>
* Reyhaniye Mosque: Mosque of uncertain date, probably of the Akkoyonlu or early Ottoman period (15th-16th centuries).<ref name=":2" />
* Hatuniye Medrese or Sitt Ridwiyya Madrasa: Believed to have been built by the Artuqid sultan Qutb ad-Din Il-Ghazi II (r. 1175–1184), with a mausoleum that may have been intended for the sultan's mother, Sitt Ridwiyya (Sitti Radviyye). The building now serves as a mosque. Both the prayer hall and the mausoleum contain finely-decorated ''[[mihrab]]''s.<ref name=":2" />

=== Other landmarks ===

* Citadel: The citadel occupies a long ridge at the city's highest point. It was probably first built under the [[Hamdanid dynasty|Hamdanids]] (10th century), but its present walls were likely rebuilt in the Akkoyonlu and Ottoman eras, possibly with some reuse of Artuqid materials. Up until the 19th century it was densely inhabited, but is now occupied by a military radar station. The interior includes the remains of a small mosque.<ref name=":2" />

=== House architecture ===
[[File:Mardin P1030261 20080423101500.JPG|thumb|Mardin Post Office, an example of traditional domestic architecture]]

Houses in Mardin tend to have multiple levels and terraces to accommodate their sloping site, giving the old city its "stepped" appearance from afar.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|last1=Balamir|first1=Aydan|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HbhTCwAAQBAJ&dq=mardin+houses&pg=PA128|title=The Mediterranean Medina: International Seminar|last2=Uraz|first2=Türkan|publisher=Gangemi Editore spa|year=2006|isbn=978-88-492-9013-4|pages=128|language=en|chapter=The Extrovert Courtyard House: an Urban Typology in Mardin.
