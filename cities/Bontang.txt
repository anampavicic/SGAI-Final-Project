'''Bontang''' is a city on the eastern coast of the island of [[Borneo]] in Indonesia, in the province of [[East Kalimantan]].  It occupies an area of {{convert|161.88|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and the population was 140,787 at the 2010 census,<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 178,917 at the 2020 census;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as of mid-2023 was 189,968 (comprising 98,222 males and 91,746 females).<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Bontang Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.6473)</ref> It is also the third most densely populated place in the province after [[Balikpapan]] and [[Samarinda]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=BPS Kota Bontang|url=https://bontangkota.bps.go.id/publication/2020/11/27/4fddb685d282cec3d260b750/statistik-daerah-kota-bontang-2020.html|access-date=2021-04-22|website=bontangkota.bps.go.id}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Etymology ===
Bontang refers to the town's traditional status as a humble village populated mostly by immigrants. Alternately, the name of the town means 'a group of visitors'. A coastal town, Bontang was initially a settlement governed under the [[Kutai]] Sultanate based in [[Tenggarong]].<ref name="one"><u>Potret Lingkungan Hidup Kota Bontang</u>. Pemerintah Kota Bontang: Kelompok Kerja Program Pengelolaan SDA. Bontang: 2003.</ref>

=== Colonial era ===
In 1920, the village of Bontang was established as a district headquarters, which was at that time called the ''Onder Van Bontang'' District. Bontang was still a district under the leadership of a {{lang|id|wedana}} assistant who was a [[Clergy|cleric]] in the government of Sultan Aji Muhammad Parikesit, the 19th Sultan of Kutai Kartanegara (1921-1960).

=== Independence era ===
Since 1954, a district head has taken office. The enactment of Law No. 27 of 1959 concerning the establishment of the Regional Level (Dati) II in East Kalimantan removed the status of self-government.<ref name="masakemasa">{{Cite web|url=http://www.klikbontang.com/berita-13540-pemerintahan-bontang-dari-masa-ke-masa.html|title=Klik Bontang - Pemerintahan Bontang dari Masa ke Masa|website=klikbontang.com|language=id|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref> In 1972, the government of the then Kutai Regency recognized Bontang as a district.

Major development of Bontang as an industrial area took place following the establishment of two major companies, [[Badak NGL|PT Badak Natural Gas Liquefaction]] in 1974, and [[Pupuk Kalimantan Timur|PT Pupuk Kaltim]], a company specializing in the production of ammonia and fertilizer, three years later. Both companies built facilities and infrastructure that were very important for the economic growth of the city,

From 1978 onwards, Bontang experienced rapid regional expansion. Consequently, on 1 December 1989, by the enactment of government law No. 20 of 1989, the central government upgraded Bontang from a district to an administrative city (''kota administratif - kotif'') and split into three districts, North Bontang, South Bontang, and [[Sangatta]] (later split into 5 districts, and renamed to North Sangatta). Also, the villages of Santan Ilir, Central Santan, and Santan Ulu were transferred into [[Muara Badak]] (and now part of Marang Kayu in [[Kutai Kartanegara Regency]]).<ref name="one" />

In 1999, Bontang became an autonomous independent city (''kotamadya''). A third district - West Bontang - was created on 16 August 2003 from parts of the other two.

== Geography ==
[[File:Bontang aerial 2014.jpg|left|thumb|Aerial view of Southern Bontang]]
Bontang is located between 117° 23{{prime}} E and 117° 32{{prime}} E and 0° 01{{prime}} N and 0° 12{{prime}} N. It administers an area of 497.57&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Profil Kota Bontang|url=http://ciptakarya.pu.go.id/profil/profil/timur/kaltim/bontang.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714032014/http://ciptakarya.pu.go.id:80/profil/profil/timur/kaltim/bontang.pdf |archive-date=14 July 2010 }}</ref>

Within this area, only 29% is land. The city is dominated by flat lands ranging from 0 – 106 meters above sea level but also includes several hills. Approximately 48% of the city's land area is located in coastal regions and is characteristically level with a slope of 0 - 2%. It is bordered by [[East Kutai Regency]] in the north and west, [[Makassar Strait]] in the east, and [[Kutai Kartanegara Regency]] in the south. Soil deposits in the city largely consist of [[podzol]] in the interior and [[alluvium]] sediments in the coastal region. This makes the city prone to [[erosion]] and the use of land for agriculture or development requires prior soil stabilisation.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Profil Kota Bontang Final|url=https://sippa.ciptakarya.pu.go.id/sippa_online/ws_file/dokumen/rpi2jm/DOCRPIJM_14828486066__BAB_IV_Profil_Kota_Bontang_Final.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210422184526/https://sippa.ciptakarya.pu.go.id/sippa_online/ws_file/dokumen/rpi2jm/DOCRPIJM_14828486066__BAB_IV_Profil_Kota_Bontang_Final.pdf |archive-date=22 April 2021 }}</ref>

The city is part of the [[Kutai Basin|Kutai basin]], and is dominated by [[quartz sand]] and [[sandstone]] formations created by sediment from nearby rivers.<ref name=":1" />

== Demographics ==
In 2021, the city population had increased by 1.07% compared with the previous year. The sex ratio as of 2023 was 100 females to 107 males. As with most Indonesian cities, the population is young, with people in the age range 15 – 64 years accounting for around 70%. The most densely-occupied district in 2023 is North Bontang (2,655 per square kilometre), and the least dense is South Bontang (640.5 per square kilometre).

== Economy ==
[[File:Port Bontang.jpg|thumb|Port in Bontang city|left]]In 2010, Bontang had the highest municipal [[Per capita income|GDP (nominal) per capita]] in Indonesia, amounting to Rp375,407,000 (US$38,306) according to [[Statistics Indonesia]].<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1 December 2015|title=Produk Domestik Regional Bruto Kabupaten/Kota di Indonesia 2010-2014|trans-title=Gross Regional Domestic Product of Regencies/Municipalities in Indonesia|url=https://www.bps.go.id/publication/2015/12/01/52f02f071dbd59f971da2838/produk-domestik-regional-bruto-kabupaten-kota-di-indonesia-2010-2014.html|format=PDF|journal=Produk Domestik Regional Bruto Kabupaten/Kotamadya di Indonesia = Gross Regional Domestic Product of Regencies/Municipalities in Indonesia|language=id|location=Jakarta|publisher=[[Statistics Indonesia]]|volume=07140|issue=1507|page=167|issn=1907-8242}}</ref> However, there has been a decreasing trend in income and GDP per capita since 2015 due to the decline of [[coal mining]] and [[Liquefied natural gas|LNG]] production caused by negative economic growth.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pertumbuhan Ekonomi Kaltim Negatif, Ini yang Dilakukan Kepala Daerah|url=http://kaltim.prokal.co/read/news/299183-pertumbuhan-ekonomi-kaltim-negatif-ini-yang-dilakukan-kepala-daerah.html|access-date=2019-01-03|website=Kaltim Post|language=id}}</ref>

=== Fishing and agriculture ===

The fishing industry in Bontang is small, consisting mainly of small-scale fish farming for local consumption in Bontang and nearby cities, such as [[Balikpapan]]. A small amount of the catch is exported to [[Makassar]] and Hong Kong.<ref name="taman"><u>Taman Nasional Kutai</u></ref> Only a small proportion of the land in Bontang is available and/or suitable for farming. As a result, only about 4% of Bontang residents are involved in agriculture.<ref name="taman" />

=== Manufacturing ===

[[Pupuk Kalimantan Timur|PT Pupuk Kaltim]] was established in 1977. It is an Indonesian government-owned fertilizer company that manufactures [[ammonia]] and [[urea]] from the area's natural gas. The company operates four units producing ammonia and five units producing urea, resulting in an annual output of 1,850,000&nbsp;tons of ammonia and 2,980,000&nbsp;tons of urea. The ammonia production is exported to countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, and India, as well as being used locally in Indonesia whilst urea is distributed to national rice farmers and plantations (rubber, oil palm, etc.). 
There are also other manufacturing companies in Kaltim Industrial Estate near PT Pupuk Kaltim e.g. PT. Kaltim Parna Industri produces ammonia and PT Kaltim Methanol Industri that produces methanol.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pupuk Kaltim Ekspansi Pabrik Baru|date=22 March 2021 |url=https://bisnis.tempo.co/read/1444619/pupuk-kaltim-siapkan-rp-3625-t-untuk-bangun-pabrik-di-bintuni-dan-bontang|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210322070945/https://bisnis.tempo.co/read/1444619/pupuk-kaltim-siapkan-rp-3625-t-untuk-bangun-pabrik-di-bintuni-dan-bontang |archive-date=22 March 2021 }}</ref> As of 2015, the city is the biggest producer of urea and ammonia in [[South East Asia]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pupuk Kaltim-5 Produsen Amoniak dan Urea Terbesar di Asia Tenggara|url=https://www.beritasatu.com/ekonomi/77674/pupuk-kaltim-5-produsen-amoniak-dan-urea-terbesar-di-asia-tenggara|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210508082535/https://www.beritasatu.com/ekonomi/77674/pupuk-kaltim-5-produsen-amoniak-dan-urea-terbesar-di-asia-tenggara |archive-date=8 May 2021 }}</ref>

=== Energy and mining ===

[[Badak NGL|PT Badak LNG]] was established on 26 November 1974 as a joint-venture company with [[Pertamina]], [[Total S.A.]], Vico, and Jilco. It currently produces around 22&nbsp;million tons of [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) per year, most of which is exported to Japan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Archived copy|url=http://www.badakngl.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807040801/http://www.badakngl.com/|archive-date=7 August 2009|accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref> PT Indominco, a coal mining company, was established in 1977. It is owned by a Thai company, [[Banpu]], and extracts up to 11&nbsp;million tons of coal per year. The coal is mainly sold to electricity companies in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Indominco.com - Resources and Information|url=http://www.indominco.com/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807141437/http://indominco.com/|archive-date=7 August 2018|access-date=12 June 2019}}</ref>
