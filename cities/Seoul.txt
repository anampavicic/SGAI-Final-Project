'''Seoul''',{{efn|{{IPAc-en|s|oʊ|l}} {{respell|SOHL}}; {{Korean|hangul=서울}}; {{IPA|ko|sʰʌ.uɭ|IPA|ko-Seoul.ogg}}; {{Literal translation|Capital}}.}} officially '''Seoul Special Metropolitan City''',{{efn|{{Korean|hangul=서울특별시|rr=Seoul Teukbyeolsi|links=no}}.}} is the [[capital city|capital]] and largest city of [[South Korea]]. The broader [[Seoul Capital Area]], encompassing [[Gyeonggi Province]] and [[Incheon|Incheon Metropolitan City]], emerged as the world's [[List of cities by GDP|sixth largest metropolitan economy]] in 2022, trailing behind [[Paris metropolitan area|Paris]], [[San Francisco Bay Area|San Francisco]], [[Greater Los Angeles|Los Angeles]], [[Greater Tokyo Area|Tokyo]], and [[New York metropolitan area|New York]], and hosts more than half of South Korea's population. Although Seoul's population peaked at slightly over 10 million, it has gradually decreased since 2014, standing at approximately 9.97 million residents as of 2020. Seoul is the seat of the [[Government of South Korea|South Korean government]].

Seoul's history traces back to 18 BC when it was founded by the people of [[Baekje]], one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. During the [[Joseon]] dynasty, Seoul was officially designated as the capital, surrounded by the Fortress Wall of Seoul. In the early 20th century, Seoul was occupied by the [[Japanese Empire]], temporarily renamed "[[Keijō]]" ("Gyeongseong" in Korean). The [[Korean War]] brought fierce battles, with Seoul changing hands four times and leaving the city mostly in ruins. Nevertheless, the city has since undergone significant reconstruction and rapid urbanization.

Seoul was rated Asia's most livable city, with the second-highest quality of life globally according to [[Arcadis]] in 2015 and a GDP per capita (PPP) of approximately $40,000. 15 [[Fortune Global 500|''Fortune'' Global 500]] companies, including industry giants such as [[Samsung]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/global500/samsung-electronics-13/|title=Samsung Electronics|website=Fortune|access-date=24 October 2014|archive-date=24 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024065549/http://fortune.com/global500/samsung-electronics-13/|url-status=live}}</ref> [[LG]], and [[Hyundai Motor Group|Hyundai]], are headquartered in the Seoul Capital Area, which has major technology hubs, such as Gangnam and Digital Media City.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/technology/tech-capitals-of-the-world/2007/06/16/1181414598292.html |title=Tech capitals of the world |work=The Age |date=15 June 2009 |access-date=7 August 2013 |location=Melbourne |archive-date=12 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912100420/http://www.theage.com.au/news/technology/tech-capitals-of-the-world/2007/06/16/1181414598292.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Seoul is ranked seventh in the [[Global city|Global Power City Index]] and the [[Global Financial Centres Index]], and is one of the five leading hosts of global conferences.<ref>[http://www.uia.be/sites/uia.be/files/documents/statistics/press/press12.pdf Union of International Associations (UIA) International Meetings Statistics for the Year 2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703095242/http://www.uia.be/sites/uia.be/files/documents/statistics/press/press12.pdf |date=3 July 2014 }}. Joel Fischer.</ref> The city has also hosted major events such as the [[1986 Asian Games]], the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], and the [[2010 G20 Seoul summit]], in addition to three matches at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]].

Seoul is geographically set in a mountainous and hilly terrain, with [[Bukhansan]] positioned on its northern edge. Within the Seoul Capital Area lie five UNESCO World Heritage Sites: [[Changdeokgung]], [[Hwaseong Fortress]], [[Jongmyo]], [[Namhansanseong]], and the [[Royal Tombs of the Joseon dynasty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/kr|title=Lists: Republic of Korea|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|access-date=26 December 2019|archive-date=25 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225050657/http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/kr|url-status=live}}</ref> Furthermore, Seoul has witnessed a surge in modern architectural development, with iconic landmarks including the [[N Seoul Tower]], the [[63 Building]], the [[Lotte World Tower]], the [[Dongdaemun Design Plaza]], [[Lotte World]], the [[Trade Tower]], [[Starfield COEX Mall|COEX]], [[International Finance Center Seoul|IFC Seoul]], and [[Parc1]]. Seoul was named the [[World Design Capital]] in 2010 and has served as the national hub for the music, entertainment, and cultural industries that have propelled [[K-pop]] and the [[Korean Wave]] to international prominence.

==Toponymy==
{{main article|Names of Seoul}}
Traditionally, ''seoul'' ({{Korean|hangul=서울|labels=no}}) has been a native Korean (as opposed to [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]]) [[common noun]] simply meaning 'capital city.' The word ''seoul'' is believed to have descended from ''Seorabeol'' (서라벌; historically transliterated into the Hanja form 徐羅伐), which originally referred to [[Gyeongju]], the capital of [[Silla]].{{efn|Ancient Gyeongju was also known in documents by the Sino-Korean name ''Geumseong'' (금성; {{lang|ko|金城}}, literally 'gold city' or 'metal city').}}<ref>{{Cite web|website=[[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]]|script-title=ko:서울|author=정구복|access-date=August 17, 2024|url=https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0027956}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ju |first=Bo Don |date=2019 |title=Gyeongju, a City of History |url=http://www.ijkaa.org:443/v.13/0/15/8 |journal=Journal of Korean Art & Archaeology |language=en |volume=13 |pages=15–23 |doi=10.23158/jkaa.2019.v13_02 |issn=2951-4983}}</ref>

[[Wiryeseong]] ({{Korean|labels=no|위례성|慰禮城}}), the capital settlement of [[Baekje]], was located within the boundaries of modern-day Seoul. Seoul was also known by other various historical names, such as Bukhansan-gun (북한산군; 北漢山郡, during the [[Goguryeo]] era), Namcheon ({{Korean|labels=no|남천|南川}},<ref name="Jinheung Taewang Stele Seoul" /> during the [[Silla]] era), [[History of Seoul|Hanyang]] ({{Korean|labels=no|한양|漢陽}}, during the [[Northern and Southern States period]]), Namgyeong (남경; 南京, during the [[Goryeo]] era), and Hanseong ({{Korean|hangul=한성|hanja=漢城|labels=no}}, during the [[Joseon]] era). The word ''seoul'' was used colloquially to refer to the capital as early as the 17th century.<ref>[[Hendrick Hamel]], a 17th-century Dutch sailor who was shipwrecked on [[Jeju Island]], referred to the Joseon capital as ''Sior'' in his book "Hamel's Journal and a Description of the Kingdom of Korea, 1653–1666." Refer to the English translation of the book on this [https://www.hendrick-hamel.henny-savenije.pe.kr/holland6.htm website] created by Dr. Henny Savenije, a Dutch scholar known for his research on Hamel.</ref> Thus, the [[Joseon]] capital of ''Hanseong'' was widely referred to as the ''seoul.''<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Yu|first1=Woo-ik|last2=Lee|first2=Chan|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Seoul|title=Seoul|date=6 November 2019|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=4 July 2020|quote=The city was popularly called Seoul in Korean during both the [[Chosŏn]] (Yi) dynasty (1392–1910) and the period of Japanese rule (1910–45), although the official names in those periods were Hansŏng (Hanseong) and [[Kyŏngsŏng]] (Gyeongseong), respectively.|archive-date=9 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609191034/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/534948/Seoul|url-status=live}}</ref> Due to its common usage, French missionaries called the Joseon capital ''Séoul'' (/se.ul/) in their writings, hence the common romanization ''Seoul'' in various languages today.

Under subsequent [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonization]], ''Hanseong'' was renamed as ''Keijō'' (京城, literally 'capital city'){{efn|Also referred to as Gyeongseong ({{Korean|labels=no|경성|京城}}) via its Korean pronunciation.}} by the Imperial authorities to prevent confusion with the [[Hanja]] '{{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|漢}}}}' (a transliteration of an ancient native Korean word ''han'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|한}}) meaning 'great'), which may also refer to the [[Han Chinese|Han people]] or the [[Han dynasty]] in Chinese and is associated with 'China' in Japanese context.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pDZYDwAAQBAJ&q=Hanseong+was+renamed+to+Keij%C5%8D&pg=PT136|title=Eclipsed Cinema: The Film Culture of Colonial Korea|date=22 March 2017|isbn=9781474421829|last1=Kim|first1=Dong Hoon|access-date=21 November 2020|archive-date=14 July 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220714164921/https://books.google.com/books?id=pDZYDwAAQBAJ&q=Hanseong+was+renamed+to+Keij%C5%8D&pg=PT136|url-status=live}}</ref> After [[World War II]] and the [[Surrender of Japan|liberation of Korea]], ''Seoul'' became the official name for the Korean capital.

Unlike most place names in Korea, as it is not a Sino-Korean word, 'Seoul' has no inherently corresponding Hanja ([[Chinese characters]] used in the Korean language). Instead of [[Transcription into Chinese characters|phonetically transcribing]] 'Seoul' to Chinese, in the [[Sinophone|Chinese-speaking]] world, Seoul was called ''Hànchéng'' ({{zh|s= 汉城|t=漢城|labels=no}}), which is the Chinese pronunciation of ''Hanseong''. On 18 January 2005, the [[Seoul Metropolitan Government]] changed Seoul's official Chinese name from the historic ''Hànchéng'' to ''Shǒu'ěr'' ({{zh|links=no|s=首尔|t=首爾|p=|labels=no}}). ''Shǒu'ěr'' is a [[Phono-semantic matching|phono-semantic match]] incorporating both sound and meaning (through 首 meaning 'head', 'chief', 'first').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=022&aid=0000126138 |script-title=ko:서울특별시표기 ''首爾''로...중국, 곧 정식 사용키로 |language=ko |publisher=[[Naver News]] |date=23 October 2005 |access-date=10 February 2012 |archive-date=25 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125042516/http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=104&oid=022&aid=0000126138 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://goodcharacters.com/newsletters/summer2006-seoul-korea.html|title=Chinese Naming Crisis Danger Opportunity Summer 2006 – Good Characters|last=Characters|first=Good|website=goodcharacters.com|access-date=18 November 2018|archive-date=30 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930195048/http://goodcharacters.com/newsletters/summer2006-seoul-korea.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Early history ===
Settlement of the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] area, where present-day Seoul is located, began around 4000 BC.<ref name="Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/534948/Seoul/24023/Cultural-life#toc24024|title=Seoul|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|access-date=7 February 2014|archive-date=22 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222100436/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/534948/Seoul/24023/Cultural-life#toc24024|url-status=live}}</ref>

Seoul became the [[List of purpose-built national capitals|planned capital]] of Korea by [[Yi Seong-gye]], the founding father of the [[Joseon]] dynasty. After enthroning himself as [[Taejo of Joseon|King]] at the capital of old [[Goryeo]] in 1392, Yi Seong-gye changed the name of his Kingdom from Goryeo to Joseon in 1393 and began his search for a place for a new capital. After several governmental debates, Yi Seong-gye chose Hanyang (Sindo) instead of Muak in September 1394. As Joseon's new capital, Hanyang was planned as a geographic embodiment of [[Korean Confucianism]]. Construction of the city began in October 1394. During its early construction stages, some major palaces, including [[Gyeongbokgung]], were finished in 1395. The [[Fortress Wall of Seoul|Fortress Wall]] surrounding Hanyang was partially finished around 1396.<ref>{{cite book |author1=김기호 |author2=김웅호 |author3=염복규 |author4=김영심 |author5=김도연 |author6=유승희 |author7=박준형 |date=2021-11-30 |script-title=ko:서울도시계획사 1 현대 이전의 도시계획 (서울역사총서 12) |trans-title=History of urban planning in Seoul, Vol. 1., Urban planning before contemporary age |url=https://lib.seoul.go.kr/search/detail/CATTOT000001524017 |language=ko |location=Seoul |publisher=Seoul Historiography Institute |isbn=9791160711301}}</ref>{{rp|96–111}}

The city of Hanyang was governed by the {{ill|Hanseongbu|ko|한성부}} ({{Korean|한성부|labels=no}}), an agency of the national government dedicated to affairs on the administration of the capital city.

The ''Doseong-an'' area later gained the informal but popular name ''Sadaemun-an'' ({{Korean|사대문 안|labels=no}}), which literally means 'areas inside of the [[The Eight Gates of Seoul|Four Great Gates]]', and became the one and only [[Downtown Seoul|downtown (city center) of Hanyang city]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=김경록 |author2=유승희 |author3=김경태 |author4=이현진 |author5=정은주 |author6=최진아 |author7=이민우 |author8=진윤정 |date=2019-06-03 |title=조선시대 다스림으로 본 성저십리 (서울역사중점연구 5) |trans-title=Seongjeosimni in governance of Joseon (Studies on special topics of Seoul History, Vol. 5.) |url=https://lib.seoul.go.kr/search/detail/CATTOT000001318441 |language=ko |location=Seoul |publisher=Seoul Historiography Institute |isbn=9791160710670}}</ref>{{rp|90–100}}

Much of modern development around this era was propelled by trade with foreign countries like France and the United States. For example, the [[Seoul Electric Company]], Seoul Electric Trolley Company, and Seoul Fresh Spring Water Company were all joint Korean–U.S. owned enterprises.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/koreaundersiege10000chun|url-access=registration|title=Korea under Siege, 1876–1945 : Capital Formation and Economic Transformation|author=Young-Iob Chung|page=[https://archive.org/details/koreaundersiege10000chun/page/70 70]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780198039662}}</ref>

=== Japanese annexation of Korea ===
{{Main|Keijō|Korea under Japanese rule}}
[[File:L’Indépendance de la Corée et la Paix-02.jpg|thumb|[[March First Movement]] in Seoul, 1919]]

After the [[Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty|annexation treaty]] in 1910, [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] annexed Korea and renamed the city [[Gyeongseong]] ("Kyongsong" in Korean and "[[Keijō]]" in Japanese). The city saw significant transformation under Japanese colonial rule. Imperial Japan removed the city walls, paved roads, and built Western-style buildings.

Seoul was deprived of its special status as the capital city and downsized under imperial Japan, compared to the traditional notion among people of the [[Joseon]] dynasty that Seoul included the area of approximately {{convert|4|km|mile|sp=us|abbr=on}} radius surrounding the [[Fortress Wall of Seoul|Fortress Wall]] (i.e., [[Outer old Seoul]]; {{Korean|hangul=성저십리|hanja=城底十里|labels=no}}). On October 1, 1910, Imperial Japan demoted Seoul as no different than any other city within the [[Gyeonggi Province]]. After Imperial Japan's redistricting, Seoul only included the area inside the [[Fortress Wall of Seoul|Fortress Wall]] and present-day [[Yongsan District]]. In the 1930s, as part of Imperial Japan's war efforts leading up to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], [[Yeongdeungpo District]] was annexed into Seoul on April 1, 1936, to function as an industrial complex for steel and other [[metalworking]] factories.

The city was liberated by U.S. forces at the end of [[World War II]].

In 1945, following the liberation from Japanese colonial rule, the American military assumed control of Korea, including its capital city, then referred to as Kyeongseongbu in line with Japanese nomenclature. The [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|U.S. military government]] published the Charter of the City of Seoul in the official gazette on October 10 of the following year. The charter declared Seoul as the name of the city and established it as a [[municipal corporation]].

During the [[Korean War]], Seoul changed hands between the Soviet- and Chinese-backed North Korean forces and the American-backed South Korean forces four times: falling to the North Koreans in the June 1950 [[First Battle of Seoul]], recaptured by UN forces in the September 1950 [[Second Battle of Seoul]], falling to a combined Chinese-North Korean force in the January 1951 [[Third Battle of Seoul]], and finally being recaptured once more by UN forces in [[Operation Ripper]] during the spring of 1951.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Korean War Chronology  |url=https://history.army.mil/reference/korea/kw-chrono.htm |access-date=6 September 2023 |website=U.S. Army Center of Military History |archive-date=9 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230909160307/https://history.army.mil/reference/Korea/kw-chrono.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Chapter XXVI: The Capture of Seoul |url=https://history.army.mil/books/korea/20-2-1/sn26.htm |access-date=6 September 2023 |website=U.S. Army Center of Military History |archive-date=7 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230207134826/https://history.army.mil/BOOKS/KOREA/20-2-1/sn26.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> The extensive fighting left the city heavily damaged after the war.

Following the war, Seoul began to focus on reconstruction and modernization. As [[Miracle on the Han River|South Korea's economy started to grow rapidly]] from the 1960s, [[urbanization]] also accelerated and workers began to move to Seoul and other larger cities.<ref name="hamnett"/> In 1963, Seoul went through two major expansions that established the shape and size of the present-day Seoul—barring minor adjustments to the borders later in 1973 and 2000. In August 1963, Seoul annexed parts of [[Yangju|Yangju-gun]], [[Gwangju|Gwangju-gun]], [[Siheung|Siheung-gun]], [[Gimpo|Gimpo-gun]], and [[Bucheon|Bucheon-gun]], expanding the northeastern borders of Seoul. In September, Seoul again annexed present-day [[Gangnam]].<ref>{{cite web |title=서울의 역사 |url=https://www.seoul.go.kr/seoul/history.do |website=[[Seoul Metropolitan Government]] |language=ko}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://spp.seoul.go.kr/cms/board/Download.jsp?fileId=IUAjJDMyMTY1LS0kJA==|title=Urban Planning of Seoul|publisher=[[Seoul Metropolitan Government]]|format=PDF|year=2009|access-date=7 February 2014|archive-date=25 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125042517/http://spp.seoul.go.kr/cms/board/Download.jsp?fileId=IUAjJDMyMTY1LS0kJA==|url-status=live}}</ref> The two consecutive expansions more than doubled the size of Seoul from approximately {{convert|268|km2|mi2|sp=us|abbr=on}} to {{convert|613|km2|mi2|sp=us|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=면적과 인구밀도 |url=https://data.si.re.kr/data/지표로-본-서울-변천-2003/374 |website=data.si.re.kr |publisher=서울연구데이터서비스}}</ref>

After annexation, [[Gangnam]]'s development was spurred by key infrastructure projects: the construction of the [[Hannam Bridge]] (1966–1969) and [[Gyeongbu Expressway]] (1968–1970). As Seoul's population kept growing, [[Park Chung Hee|Park]]'s regime focused its development plans on Gangnam. The main hurdle for Gangnam's development was floods because the area is low-lying and prone to flooding. Then Seoul mayor Kim Hyun-ok ordered construction of an expressway that doubled as [[Embankment (earthworks)|embankment]], which became the present-day [[Gangbyeonbuk-ro|Gangbyeon Expressway]]. The construction started in March 1967 and completed in September of the same year. Similar projects transformed previously flood-prone areas into usable land for development. Such areas include the current [[Ichon-dong]], the [[Banpo-dong|Banpo apartment complex]], [[Apgujeong-dong]] and [[Jamsil-dong]].

==Geography==
[[File:Earth_from_Space-_Seoul,_South_Korea_ESA24817251.jpg|thumb|Satellite picture of Seoul]]
Seoul is in the northwest of South Korea. Seoul proper comprises {{convert|605.25|km2|sqmi|abbr=unit}},<ref name="seoul1">{{cite web|url=http://stat.seoul.go.kr/Seoul_System5.jsp?stc_cd=412|title=Seoul Statistics (Land Area)|publisher=[[Seoul Metropolitan Government]]|access-date=24 March 2010|archive-date=19 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019175850/http://stat.seoul.go.kr/Seoul_System5.jsp?stc_cd=412|url-status=live}}</ref> with a radius of approximately {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}}, roughly bisected into northern and southern halves by the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]]. The river is no longer actively used for navigation, because its [[estuary]] is located at the borders of the two Koreas, with civilian entry barred. There are four main mountains in central Seoul: [[Bugaksan]], [[Inwangsan]], [[Naksan]] and [[Namsan (Seoul)|Namsan]]. The [[Fortress Wall of Seoul|Seoul Fortress Wall]], which historically bounded the city, goes over these mountains. The city is bordered by eight mountains, as well as the more level lands of the Han River plain and western areas.

===Parks===
{{Main article|List of parks in Seoul}}
[[File:Hangang Park Overview 201604.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Hangang Park|Han River Park]]]]
Seoul has a large quantity of parks. One of the most famous parks is [[Namsan (Seoul)|Namsan Park]], which offers recreational hiking and views of the [[downtown Seoul]] skyline, especially via its [[N Seoul Tower]]. [[Olympic Park, Seoul|Seoul Olympic Park]], located in [[Songpa District]] and built to host the 1988 Summer Olympics, is the largest park. The areas near the stream [[Tancheon]] are popular for exercise. [[Cheonggyecheon]] also has spaces for recreation. In 2017 the [[Seoullo 7017 Skypark]] opened, spanning diagonally overtop Seoul Station.

There are also many parks along the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]], such as Ichon Hangang Park, Yeouido Hangang Park, Mangwon Hangang Park, Nanji Hangang Park, Banpo Hangang Park, Ttukseom Hangang Park and Jamsil Hangang Park. The Seoul National Capital Area also contains a [[green belt]] aimed at preventing the city from [[Urban sprawl|sprawling]] out into neighboring Gyeonggi Province. These areas are frequently sought after by people looking to escape from urban life on weekends and during vacations.

==== Air pollution inside the Metro system ====
In January 2024 [[Seoul Metro]], whose passengers at the time numbered approximately 7 million a day, announced plans for extensive pollution reduction measures across the network. The target was to cut pollution to over 30% below the legal limit of 50 μg/m3. The target was 32 μg/m3 by 2026. The outset actuality was 38.8 μg/m3 average concentration of pollution.  Starting in 2024, ₩100 billion annually for three years was earmarked for air pollution reduction measures. These included installation of air conditioning, better ventilation systems and filters, replacement of dust-inducing gravel rail tunnel beds with concrete ones, dust-capture matting at turnstiles, and constant public readings for pollution within the system.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-01-16 |title=Seoul Metro initiates plans to reduce air pollution by over 30% - |url=https://english.seoul.go.kr/seoul-metro-initiates-plans-to-reduce-air-pollution-by-over-30/ |access-date=2024-09-01 |website=Official Website of the |language=en-US}}</ref>

Urban and civil planning was a key concept when Seoul was first designed to serve as a capital in the late 14th century. The Joseon dynasty built the "Five Grand Palaces" in Seoul—[[Changdeokgung]], [[Changgyeonggung]], [[Deoksugung]], [[Gyeongbokgung]] and [[Gyeonghuigung]]—all of which are located in the Jongno and Jung Districts. Among them, Changdeokgung was added to the UNESCO [[World Heritage]] List in 1997 as an "outstanding example of Far Eastern palace architecture and garden design". The main palace, Gyeongbokgung, underwent a large-scale restoration project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalpalace.go.kr/html/eng/data/data_01.jsp?dep1=2&dep2=1|title=About the Palace|publisher=Gyeongbokgung Palace|access-date=12 February 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614221413/http://www.royalpalace.go.kr/html/eng/data/data_01.jsp?dep1=2&dep2=1|archive-date=14 June 2008}}</ref> Seoul has been surrounded by walls that were built to regulate visitors from other regions and protect the city in case of an invasion.
