'''Zamboanga Peninsula''' ({{lang-ceb|Lawis sa Zamboanga.}}; {{lang-cbk|Peninsula de Zamboanga}}; {{lang-fil|Tangway ng Zamboanga}}) is an [[Regions of the Philippines|administrative region]] in [[Mindanao]], [[Philippines]], designated as '''Region IX'''. It consists of the [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] of [[Zamboanga del Norte]], [[Zamboanga Sibugay]] and [[Zamboanga del Sur]], and the cities of [[Isabela, Basilan|Isabela]] and [[Zamboanga City]]. The region was previously known as '''Western Mindanao'''. [[Pagadian]] serves as the regional center, while Zamboanga City is the commercial and industrial center.<ref name="EO429" />

== History ==

=== Ancient era ===
During the ancient era, the Zamboanga peninsula was a vast territory home to various ethnic groups – the largest of which was the [[Subanen people]]. Later on, the southern coastal areas of the region were under the influence of the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] [[Majapahit Empire]], although the empire never did conquer the area.

=== Sultanate of Maguindanao era ===
In the 14th century, the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] ruled the southwestern sections of the peninsula. By the late 15th century and early 16th century, [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] missionaries further spread Islam in the southern Philippines. [[Sharif Kabungsuwan]], a Johore-born missionary of [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] and [[Arabs|Arab]] descent established the [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]], which the entire island of [[Mindanao]] is named after. The sultanate also occupied the entire island except present-day Caraga region, stretching from the Zamboanga Peninsula to Davao Oriental, while the Sultanate of Sulu lost its territories in Zamboanga. Maguindanao's sultans provided Mindanao fierce armed resistance against the Spanish occupation, especially under the lead of [[Muhammad Kudarat]]. They soon allied themselves with the Sulu sultanate. The Muslim natives of the region were collectively known as [[Moro people|Moros]] by the Spanish, meaning "Moor", though the Iberian Moors and the Philippine Muslims had little cultural connection outside of following [[Islam]]. A large chunk of the [[Spanish–Moro conflict]], the war between the Spanish and Mindanao's Muslim natives took place in the Zamboanga Peninsula.

=== Spanish rule ===
In 1569 Zamboanga was chosen as the site of the Spanish settlement and garrison on La Caldera (now called Barrio Recodo). Zamboanga was one of the main strongholds in Mindanao, supporting colonizing efforts in the south of the island and making way for Christian settlements. It also served as a military outpost, protecting the island against foreign invaders and Moro pirates and their Chinese allies. The province, named and centered on [[Zamboanga City]] was partly founded by Peruvian soldiers brought by [[Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera]].<ref>[http://www.zamboanga.com/html/history_1634_moro_attacks.htm "SECOND BOOK OF THE SECOND PART OF THE CONQUESTS OF THE FILIPINAS ISLANDS, AND CHRONICLE OF THE RELIGIOUS OF OUR FATHER, ST. AUGUSTINE"] (Zamboanga City History)
"He (Governor Don Sebastían Hurtado de Corcuera) brought a great reënforcements of soldiers, many of them from Perú, as he made his voyage to Acapulco from that kingdom."</ref>

The Zamboanga Peninsula played a central role in the [[Spanish–Moro conflict]]. It was the site of constant battling between Spanish soldiers and Moro pirate raids. While the Spanish successfully established churches in the region, they suffered heavily at the hands of Moro raiders, and had to repeatedly withdraw from the region. While the Spanish achieved a tactical victory by launching several attacks against the [[Sultanate of Sulu]], constant fighting and attacks persisted, giving the Moros a psychological victory.

=== Province of Zamboanga ===
After the United States annexed the [[Spanish East Indies]] in 1898, the peninsula hosted a briefly independent state called the [[Republic of Zamboanga]]. It was incorporated by the [[Insular Government]] into the [[Moro Province]], which consisted of the central and western parts of [[Mindanao]] and the [[Sulu Archipelago]]. The name and status of Moro Province were changed to the [[Department of Mindanao and Sulu]] on August 16, 1916, causing Zamboanga to become a separate province.

In 1942, the Zamboanga Peninsula along with the rest of the Philippine Islands was [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|occupied]] by the [[Empire of Japan]] at the beginning of the [[World War II in the Philippines|Second World War]]. The Peninsula was liberated in 1945 by joint [[United States Army Forces in the Far East|American]] and [[Philippine Commonwealth]] forces fighting against the [[Imperial Japanese Army]].

On June 6, 1952, the province was [[partition (politics)|partitioned]] into [[Zamboanga del Norte]] and [[Zamboanga del Sur]], while the chartered city of [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]] became part of Zamboanga del Sur.

=== Region ===
Together with the [[Sulu Archipelago]], the provinces that formerly made up Zamboanga Province were re-organised into Region IX by order of Presidential Decree No. 1 as part of the Integrated Reorganization Plan of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]], that was signed on September 24, 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1972/pd_1_1972.html|title=P.D. No. 1 1972}}</ref>

From 1975 to 1989, the old Region IX (Western Mindanao) was further divided into two sub-regions by Presidential Decree No. 8233 dated August 21, 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1975/pd_773_1975.html|title=P.D. No. 773}}</ref> Sub-Region IX-A consisted of [[Basilan]], [[Sulu]] and [[Tawi-Tawi]] with [[Jolo, Sulu]], as the sub-regional center, while Sub-Region IX-B consisted of the provinces of [[Zamboanga del Norte]], [[Zamboanga del Sur]] and [[Zamboanga Sibugay]], with the chartered city of [[Zamboanga City]] as the sub-regional centre.

=== Present ===
In 2001, [[Zamboanga Sibugay]], was created from the province of Zamboanga del Sur with [[Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay|Ipil]] as the seat of government with the virtue of Republic Act No. 8973.

In the same year, the residents of [[Basilan]] opted to join the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM) in a plebiscite. However, the citizens of the capital, [[Isabela, Basilan|Isabela]], did not want to join so the city remained a part of this region as a result of Executive Order No. 36 last until 2014 only.

=== Regional center issue ===
In 1978, Presidential Decree No. 1555 transferred Region IX's regional center from [[Jolo, Sulu]] to [[Zamboanga City]].<ref name="PD1555">{{Cite web |date=1978-06-11 |title=Presidential Decree No. 1555: Further Amending Presidential Decree No. 742 as amended by Presidential Decree No. 773 transferring the regional center of Region IX from Jolo to Zamboanga City |url=https://lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1978/pd_1555_1978.html |access-date=2020-06-12 |website=The LawPhil Project}}</ref>

Executive Order (EO) No. 429 was issued in 1990 by President [[Corazon Aquino]] which provided for the reorganization of the administrative regions in Mindanao. It declared that Western Mindanao would comprise Zamboanga City, Lanao del Norte, [[Misamis Occidental]], Zamboanga del Sur, Zamboanga del Norte, Basilan, and the cities comprising those provinces. It also declared that [[Pagadian]] shall serve as the new regional center.<ref name="EO429">{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/executive/execord/eo1990/eo_429_1990.html|date=October 12, 1990|access-date=June 18, 2012|title=E.O. No. 429|publisher=The LawPhil Project}}</ref>

In 1996, President [[Fidel Ramos]] issued EO No. 325 which reorganized the Regional Development Councils. The Implementing Rules and Regulations of EO No. 325 provided that Zamboanga City is the regional center of Western Mindanao.<ref name=Sunstar>{{cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/zamboanga/local-news/palace-halts-regional-transfer|date=December 27, 2010|title=Palace halts regional transfer|newspaper=SunStar.com.ph|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131140510/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/zamboanga/local-news/palace-halts-regional-transfer|archive-date=January 31, 2011|access-date=May 23, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2001, President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] signed EO No. 36 which reorganized and renamed Western Mindanao to Zamboanga Peninsula. It was silent on the issue of regional government centers.<ref name=Sunstar /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/executive/execord/eo2001/eo_36_2001.html|date=August 12, 2015|access-date=June 18, 2016|title=E.O. 36|publisher=The LawPhil Project}}</ref> 

In 2004, Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 75 directed the transfer of regional offices from Zamboanga City to Pagadian citing EO No. 429 as its legal basis. However, it provided that the regional offices of the departments of Trade and Industry, Tourism, and Labor and Employment will remain in Zamboanga City, but shall establish a presence in Pagadian.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2004/11/12/memorandum-circular-no-75-s-2004/|date=November 12, 2004|access-date=June 12, 2020|title=Memorandum Circular No. 75, s. 2004|publisher=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines}}</ref>

On December 22, 2010, MC No. 11 was issued imposing a moratorium on the transfer of regional offices to Pagadian. The Circular cited the high economic and social costs that the employees were experiencing in maintaining two residences and in fully transferring to Pagadian. It further directed all regional offices that are already in Pagadian to continue their operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2010/12/22/memorandum-circular-no-11/|date=December 22, 2010|access-date=June 18, 2012|title=Memorandum Circular No. 11, s. 2010|publisher=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines}}</ref>

On June 30, 2020, MC No. 78 was issued, repealing MC No. 11 and lifting the moratorium on the transfer of the remaining regional offices to Pagadian. The Circular affirmed that Pagadian is the regional government center while Zamboanga City is the commercial and industrial center of Region IX.<ref>{{cite PH act|url=https://lawphil.net/executive/mc/mc2020/mc_78_2020.html|title=Repealing Memorandum Circular No. 11 (S. 2010) And Directing The Transfer Of Regional Offices Of National Government Agencies In Region IX From Zamboanga City To Pagadian City Pursuant To Executive Order No. 429 (S. 1990)|chamber=MC|number=78|date=2020-06-30|publisher=The LawPhil Project|accessdate=2024-09-15}}</ref>

On April 19, 2023, under MC No. 18, another moratorium was imposed on the transfer of regional offices to Pagadian pending further study of its implications. The regional offices that are already in Pagadian shall continue to operate thereat.<ref>{{cite PH act|url=https://lawphil.net/executive/mc/mc2023/mc_18_2023.html|title=RMposing A Moratorium On The Transfer Of National Government Regional Offices From Zamboanga City To Pagadian City Pursuant To Memorandum Circular (Mc) No. 78 (S. 2020)|chamber=MC|number=18|date=2023-04-19|publisher=The LawPhil Project|accessdate=2024-09-15}}</ref>

== Geography ==
The region is located on the western part of the island of [[Mindanao]], that lies between the [[Moro Gulf]] (part of the [[Celebes Sea]]) and the [[Sulu Sea]]. Along the shores of the peninsula are numerous bays and islands of varying sizes. The peninsula is connected to the rest of Mindanao through an [[isthmus]] situated between [[Panguil Bay]] and Pagadian Bay. The region consists of the three Zamboanga provinces and the highly urbanized independent city of Zamboanga, and the boundary between the peninsula and mainland is artificially marked by the border between the provinces of [[Zamboanga del Sur]] and [[Lanao del Norte]].  The province of [[Misamis Occidental]] occupies the northeast corner of the geographic peninsula, but is part of the [[Northern Mindanao]] administrative region, which also includes [[Misamis Oriental]] on the Mindanao mainland, formerly both part of pre-1929 [[Misamis (province)]] along the shores of [[Iligan Bay]].

=== Administrative divisions ===
==== Provinces ====
Zamboanga Peninsula comprises 3 Provinces; 1 independent, chartered and highly urbanized [[Cities of the Philippines|city]]; 3 component cities; 67 [[Municipalities of the Philippines|municipalities]] and 1,904 [[barangay]]s.

[[Sulu]], which was excluded from the [[Bangsamoro]] region, has an unclear status. The [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] ''en banc'' however had the consensus that Sulu should revert back to the Zamboanga Peninsula, the region it belonged to prior its inclusion in the ARMM back in 1989.<ref name=barmm-services>{{cite news |title=BARMM services in Sulu to continue amid SC ruling |url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/regionaltv/news/103964/barmm-services-in-sulu-to-continue-amid-sc-ruling/story/ |access-date=12 September 2024 |work=GMA Regional TV |date=12 September 2024 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=comelec-mt-region9>{{cite news |last1=Depasupil |first1=William |title=Comelec to place Sulu in Region 9 |url=https://www.manilatimes.net/2024/09/13/regions/comelec-to-place-sulu-in-region-9/1971160 |access-date=13 September 2024 |work=The Manila Times |date=13 September 2024 |language=en |quote=The <u>leaning</u> of the Commission en banc is to include it <u>for this [2025] election</u> in Region 9,}}</ref><ref name=barmm-execs-sulu-exit>{{cite news |last1=Umel |first1=Richel |last2=Dela Cruz |first2=Sheila Mae |title=BARMM execs seek help to deal with Sulu’s exit |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1982725/barmm-execs-seek-help-to-deal-with-sulus-exit |access-date=13 September 2024 |work=INQUIRER.net |date=13 September 2024 |language=en |quote=Another [issue] is to which administrative region Sulu will belong to.
