The city was designated as a [[Hero City of Ukraine]] by the Ukrainian government during the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 6, 2022 |title=Zelensky gives the honorary title 'Hero City' to Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Mariupol, Kherson, Hostomel, and Volnovakha. |url=https://kyivindependent.com/uncategorized/zelensky-gives-the-honorary-title-hero-city-to-kharkiv-chernihiv-mariupol-kherson-hostomel-and-volnovakha/ |url-status= |access-date=April 21, 2022 |website=Kyiv Independent}}</ref>

==Names and etymology==
The name ''Chernihiv''/''Chernigov'' is a compound name, which begins with the Slavic root ''Cherni-''/''Cherno-'', which means 'black'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/the-meaning-of/russian-word-d74fedd1fa3d42dc6d2dbb26079981eccd96e9ba.html|title=What does Chernyy mean|website=www.wordhippo.com|access-date=12 April 2022|language=en}}</ref> Scholars vary with interpretations of the second part of the name (''-hiv''/''-gov'', {{lang|cu|-говъ}}) though scholars such as Dr. Martin Dimnik, Professor of Medieval History at [[University of Toronto]], connect Chernihov with the worship of "the black god" [[Chernobog|Chernibog]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chernikov.com/|title=Chernikov|website=www.chernikov.com/|access-date=12 April 2022|language=en}}</ref>

The city of Chernihiv is also historically known by different names in other languages – {{langx|pl|Czernihów}}; {{langx|yi|טשערניגאָב}}.

==History==
===Early history===
Chernihiv was first mentioned (as {{lang|cu|Черниговъ}}){{citation needed|date=March 2022}} in the [[Rus'–Byzantine Treaty (907)]], but the time of its establishment is unknown.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Олександер |first=Мишанич |title=Літопис Руський: За Іпатьским Списком Переклав Леогід Махимович |publisher=Дніпро |year=1989 |isbn=5308000522 |location=Київ |page=18 |language=uk}}</ref> Artifacts from the [[Khazars|Khazar]] [[Khagan]]ate uncovered by [[Archaeology|archaeological excavations]] at a settlement there indicate that it seems to have existed at least as early as the 9th century. Towards the end of the 10th century, the city probably had its own rulers. It was there that the [[Black Grave]], one of the largest and earliest [[tumulus|royal mounds]] in [[Eastern Europe]], was excavated in the 19th century.

The city was the second wealthiest and most important in the southern portion of the [[Kievan Rus']].<ref>[http://nasledie.russportal.ru/index.php?id=histrus.klhist07 Nasledie Svyatoy Rusi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402225507/http://nasledie.russportal.ru/index.php?id=histrus.klhist07 |date=2018-04-02 }} URL accessed on January 12, 2006</ref> From the early 11th century on, it was the seat of the powerful [[Principality of Chernigov]], whose rulers at times vied for power with [[Kiev]]an [[Grand prince|Grand Prince]]s, and often overthrew them and took the primary seat in Kiev for themselves.

The [[Grand prince|grand principality]] was the largest in Kievan Rus and included not only the [[Severia]]n towns but even such remote regions as [[Murom]], [[Ryazan]] and [[Tmutarakan]]. The [[Golden Age|golden age]] of Chernigov, when the city population peaked at 25,000<!--or 50,000? - see [[Kievan Rus']] for a ref-->, lasted until 1239 when the city was [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|sacked by the hordes]] of [[Batu Khan]], and entered a long period of relative obscurity.

The area fell under the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] in 1353. The city was burned again by [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean khan]] [[Meñli I Giray]] in 1482 and 1497 and in the 15th to 17th centuries changed hands several times between Lithuania, [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovy]] (1408–1420 and from 1503), and the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (1618–1648), where it was granted [[Magdeburg rights]] in 1623 and in 1635 became a seat of [[Chernihiv Voivodeship]] in the [[Lesser Poland Province, Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Lesser Poland Province]].

The area's importance increased again in the middle of the 17th century during and after the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]]. In the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Hetman State]], Chernihiv was the city of deployment for the Chernihiv [[Cossack Hetmanate|Cossack]] [[polkovnyk|regiment]] (both a military and territorial unit of the state at the time).

===Imperial Russia===
Under the 1667 [[Truce of Andrusovo|Treaty of Andrusovo]] the legal [[suzerainty]] of the area was ceded to the [[Tsardom of Russia]], with Chernihiv remaining an important center of the autonomous [[Cossack Hetmanate]]. With the abolishment of the Hetmanate, the city became an ordinary administrative center of the [[Russian Empire]] and a capital of local administrative units. The area in general was ruled by the [[Governor-General]] appointed from [[Saint Petersburg]], the imperial capital, and Chernihiv was the capital of local [[Viceroy|namestnichestvo]] (province) (from 1782), [[Little Russia Governorate (1796-1802)|Malorosiyskaya]] or [[Little Russia]]n (from 1797) and [[Chernigov Governorate]] (from 1808).

According to the census of 1897, the city of Chernihiv had 11,000 [[Jews]] out of a total population of 27,006. Their primary occupations were industrial and commercial. Many tobacco plantations and fruit gardens in the neighborhood were owned by Jews. There were 1,321 Jewish artisans in Chernihiv, including 404 tailors and seamstresses, but the demand for artisan labor was limited to the town. There were 69 Jewish day-laborers, almost exclusively [[:wikt: teamster|teamsters]]. Few, however, were employed in factories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4308-chernigov|title=CHERNIGOV - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=jewishencyclopedia.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/chernigov|title = Chernigov}}</ref>

===World War II===
During [[World War II]], Chernihiv was occupied by the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] from 9 September 1941 to 21 September 1943. The Germans operated a Nazi prison<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=802|title=Gefängnis Cernihiv|website=Bundesarchiv.de|access-date=26 February 2022|language=de}}</ref> and a [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] battalion for Jews in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=100002307|title=Jüdisches Arbeitsbataillon Cernihiv|website=Bundesarchiv.de|access-date=26 February 2022|language=de}}</ref>

Until 18 July 2020, Chernihiv was designated as a [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]] and did not belong to Chernihiv Raion even though it was the center of the raion. As part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of [[Chernihiv Oblast]] to five, the city was merged into Chernihiv Raion.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Про утворення та ліквідацію районів.

==Architecture==
{{See also|Ancient Chernihiv}}
Chernihiv's architectural monuments chronicle the two most flourishing periods in the city's history – those of [[Kievan Rus']] (11th and 12th centuries) and of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] (late 17th and early 18th centuries).

The oldest church in the city and one of the oldest churches in Ukraine is the 5-domed [[Transfiguration Cathedral, Chernihiv|Transfiguration Cathedral]], commissioned in the early 1030s by [[Mstislav of Chernigov|Mstislav the Bold]] and completed several decades later by his brother, [[Yaroslav the Wise]]. The Cathedral of Sts [[Boris and Gleb]], dating from the mid-12th century, was much rebuilt in succeeding periods, before being restored to its original shape in the 20th century. Likewise built in brick, it has a single dome and six pillars.

The crowning achievement of Chernihiv masters was the exquisite [[Piatnytska Church (Chernihiv)|Piatnytska Church]], constructed at the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries. This graceful building was seriously damaged in the [[World War II|Second World War]]; its original medieval outlook was reconstructed to a design by [[Pyotr Baranovsky]].

The historic center of Chernihiv has been on the UNESCO [[List of World Heritage Sites in Ukraine#Tentative list|World Heritage Tentative List]] since 1989,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Historic Centre of Tchernigov, 9th -13th centuries |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/668/ |website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}</ref> but currently the creation of a renewed nomination is underway.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Shaposhnikov |first=Denys |date=2023-01-26 |title=Історичний центр Чернігова подають до списку Світової спадщини ЮНЕСКО |url=https://suspilne.media/367078-istoricnij-centr-cernigova-podaut-do-spisku-svitovoi-spadsini-unesko/ |access-date=2023-11-22 |website=Суспільне Новини |language=uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=2023-05-16 |title=«Культурний ландшафт Чернігова»: чергова спроба включити до Списку всесвітньої спадщини ЮНЕСКО історичну частину міста |url=https://oldchernihiv.com/kulturnyj-landshaft-chernigova-chergova-sproba-vklyuchyty-do-spysku-vsesvitnoyi-spadshhyny-yunesko-istorychnu-chastynu-mista/ |access-date=2023-11-22 |website=Чернігів Стародавній |language=uk}}</ref>

The earliest residential buildings in the downtown date from the late 17th century, a period when a Cossack regiment was deployed there. Two most representative residences are those of [[Colonel (Eastern Europe)|Polkovnyk]] Lyzohub (1690s) and Polkovnyk [[Pavlo Polubotok|Polubotok]] (18th century). The former mansion, popularly known as the [[Ivan Mazepa|Mazepa]] House, used to contain the regiment's chancellery. One of the most profusely decorated Cossack structures is undoubtedly the ecclesiastical [[collegium (school)|collegium]], surmounted by a [[Bell tower|bell-tower]] (1702). The archbishop's residence was constructed nearby in the 1780s. [[Catherine's Church, Chernihiv|St. Catherine Church]] (1715), with its 5 gilded pear domes, traditional for Ukrainian architecture, is thought to have been intended as a memorial to the regiment's exploits during the storm of [[Azov]] in 1696.

===Monasteries===
All through the most trying periods of its history, Chernihiv retained its [[ecclesiastical]] importance as the seat of either a bishopric or an archbishopric. At the outskirts of the modern city lie two ancient [[List of cave monasteries|cave monasteries]] formerly used as the bishops' residences.

The caves of the Yeletskyi Monastery are said to predate those of the [[Kyiv Pechersk Lavra]] (Kyiv Monastery of the Caves). Its magnificent six-pillared cathedral was erected at the turn of the 11th to 12th centuries; some traces of its 750-year-old murals may still be seen in the interior. After the domes collapsed in 1611, they were augmented and reconstructed in the [[Ukrainian Baroque|Ukrainian baroque]] style. The wall, [[monastic cell]]s, and bell-tower all date from the 17th century.

The nearby mother superior's house is thought to be the oldest residential building in the [[Left-bank Ukraine|Left-Bank Ukraine]]. The cloister's holiest [[icon]] used to be that of [[Theotokos]], who made her epiphany to [[Sviatoslav II of Kiev|Sviatoslav of Chernigov]] on 6 February 1060. The icon, called Yeletskaya after the [[fir]] wood it was painted upon, was taken to [[Moscow]] by Svyatoslav's descendants, the Baryatinsky family, in 1579.

The nearby [[Chernihiv Glory Memorial]] we can find [[Saint Anthony cave (Chernihiv)|Saint Anthony Caves]] of Saint Elijah and [[Trinity|the Holy Trinity]] features a small eponymous [[Church Building|church]], built 800 years ago. The roomy [[Trinity Monastery (Chernihiv)|Trinity cathedral]], one of the most imposing monuments of [[Ukrainian Baroque|Cossack baroque]], was erected between 1679 and 1689. Its refectory, with the adjoining church of Presentation to the Temple, was finished by 1679. There are also the 17th-century towered walls, [[monastic cell]]s, and the five-tiered belfry from the 1780s.

Other historic abbeys in the vicinity of Chernihiv include those in [[Kozelets]] and [[Hustynia]], which feature superb examples of [[Ukrainian Baroque]].

==Education==
[[File:Cdtu-wiki.jpg|thumb|[[Chernihiv National University of Technology]]]] Chernihiv has a [[Chernihiv Polytechnic National University]] and Taras Shevchenko National University "Chernihiv College".

==Transport==
=== Train ===
[[File:Железнодорожный вокзал. Чернигов.jpg|thumb|[[Chernihiv–Ovruch railway|Chernihiv Ovruch railway]] in Chernihiv]] Chernihiv has a train station with bus station called [[Chernihiv–Ovruch railway|Chernihiv Ovruch railway]]. Narrow gauge railway of 76 [[verst]]s was laid from the Kruty station of the Moscow Kyiv-Voronezh railway towards Chernihiv. In 1893, on the left bank of the [[Desna (river)|Desna River]], in the area of a modern automobile bridge, a railway station was built along the Kyiv highway. Passengers were delivered here from the city and back by horse transport.

In 1925, traffic was opened on the [[Nizhyn]] to Chernigiv section of the Southwest Railway. But rail transport in Chernihiv was postponed until 1928. The bridge over the Desna River was not ready and trains still arrived on the left bank, where the old narrow-gauge railway station was located, and passengers got to Chernihiv by road bridge. According to 2006 data, the volume of freight traffic is 84,737 wagons per year. Over 4.5 million passengers are transported each year.

However, the condition of the rolling stock and the quality of the services provided do not meet modern requirements. Since the introduction of the new high-speed train timetable, the trailed wagons of the 93/94 Chernihiv – Odesa train were canceled. As of 2015, regular trains from [[Minsk]] to [[Odesa]], and from [[St. Petersburg]] to Kyiv to Kharkiv run through Chernihiv, and there are direct connections with Moscow. Trains to Crimea (Simferopol, Feodosia) were canceled on 27 December 2014 due to [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russia's annexation of Crimea]].

=== Air transport ===
The area was served by [[Chernihiv Shestovytsia Airport]], and during the [[Cold War]] it was the site of [[Chernihiv Air Base|Chernihiv air base]]. The close airport is in [[Kyiv]] at the [[Boryspil International Airport|Boryspil Airport]] located {{convert|143.1|km|0|abbr=off}} away, and the smaller, municipally owned [[Kyiv International Airport (Zhuliany)|Zhuliany Airport]] located {{cvt|158.7|km}} away on the southern outskirts of the city of [[Kyiv]].

=== Bus and trolleybus ===
[[File:498 11т Chernihiv.jpg|thumb|right|Trolleybus in Chernihiv]]

Buses to [[Novhorod-Siverskyi]] leave hourly from [[Central Bus Station (Chernihiv)|Chernihiv's Central bus station]], located near the [[Chernihiv–Ovruch railway|Chernihiv train station]].

Public transport includes buses and [[Trolleybus|trolleybuses]]. There is no direct connection between railway station and [[Central Bus Station (Chernihiv)|Chernihiv-1]] bus station to the most central sights on the Val.
