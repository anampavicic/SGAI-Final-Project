'''Chesapeake''' is an [[independent city (United States)|independent city]] in [[Virginia]], United States. At the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]], the population was 249,422, making it the [[List of cities in Virginia|second-most populous city in Virginia]], the tenth largest in the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic]], and the [[List of United States cities by population|89th-most populous city in the United States]].<ref name="QF">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51550.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|access-date=January 5, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106041457/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51550.html|archive-date=January 6, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Chesapeake is included in the [[Hampton Roads|Hampton Roads metropolitan area]]. One of the cities in the [[South Hampton Roads]], Chesapeake was organized in 1963 by voter referendums approving the political consolidation of the [[South Norfolk, Virginia|city of South Norfolk]] with the remnants of the former [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk County]], which dated to 1691. (Much of the territory of the county had been annexed by other cities.) Chesapeake is the second-largest city by land area in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the [[List of United States cities by area|17th-largest in the United States]].

Chesapeake is a diverse city in which a few urban areas are located; it also has many square miles of protected farmland, forests, and [[wetlands]], including a substantial portion of the [[Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge]]. Extending from the rural border with [[North Carolina]] to the harbor area of [[Hampton Roads]] adjacent to the cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth, Suffolk, and Virginia Beach, Chesapeake is located on the [[Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway]]. It has miles of waterfront industrial, commercial and residential property. In 2011, Chesapeake was named the 21st best city in the United States by Bloomberg ''Businessweek.''<ref>{{cite web| title = Chesapeake ranks on best cities list | publisher = WAVY.com | url = http://www.wavy.com/dpp/news/local_news/chesapeake/chesapeake-ranks-on-best-cities-list | access-date = 2012-01-11 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928023513/http://www.wavy.com/dpp/news/local_news/chesapeake/chesapeake-ranks-on-best-cities-list | archive-date = 2011-09-28}}</ref> Chesapeake is home to the international headquarters of [[Dollar Tree]].

==History==
[[Image:Norfolk.jpg|upright=1.2|left|thumb|[[Norfolk County, Virginia]] (from 1895 map), existed from 1691 to 1963, now extinct]]
In 1963, the new [[independent city (United States)|independent city]] of Chesapeake was created when the former independent city of [[South Norfolk, Virginia|South Norfolk]] consolidated with [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk County]]. The consolidation was approved, and the new name selected by the voters of each community by referendum and authorized by the [[Virginia General Assembly]].

Formed in 1691 in the [[Virginia Colony]], Norfolk County had originally included essentially all the area which became the towns and later cities of [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]], and South Norfolk. Its area was reduced after 1871 as these cities added territory through annexations. Becoming an independent city was a method for the former county to stabilize borders with neighbors, as cities could not annex territory from each other.

The relatively small city of South Norfolk had become an [[incorporated town]] within Norfolk County in 1919 and became an independent city in 1922. Its residents wanted to make a change to put their jurisdiction on a more equal footing in other aspects with the much larger cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth. In addition, by the late 1950s, although immune from annexation by the bigger cities, South Norfolk was close to losing all the county land adjoining it to the city of Norfolk in another annexation suit.

The consolidation that resulted in the city of Chesapeake was part of a wave of changes in the structure of local government in [[Hampton Roads|southeastern Virginia]] which took place between 1952 and 1975.

The Chesapeake region was among the first areas settled in the state's [[Virginia Colony|colonial era]], when settlement started from the coast. Along Chesapeake's segment of the [[Intracoastal Waterway]], where the [[Great Bridge, Virginia|Great Bridge]] [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] marks the transition between the [[Southern Branch Elizabeth River]] and the [[Chesapeake and Albemarle Canal]], lies the site of the [[Battle of Great Bridge]]. Fought on December 9, 1775, in the early days of the [[American Revolutionary War]], the battle resulted in the removal of [[Lord Dunmore]] and all vestiges of English Government from the Colony and Dominion of Virginia.

Until the late 1980s and early 1990s, much of Chesapeake was either suburban or rural, serving as a [[bedroom community]] of the adjacent cities of [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] and [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]] with residents commuting to these locations. Beginning in the late 1980s and accelerating in the 1990s, however, Chesapeake saw significant growth, attracting numerous and significant industries and businesses of its own. This explosive growth quickly led to strains on the municipal infrastructure, ranging from intrusion of saltwater into the city's water supply to congested roads and schools.

Chesapeake made national headlines in 2003 when, under a court-ordered [[change of venue]], the community hosted the first trial of alleged [[Beltway sniper attacks|Beltway sniper]] [[Lee Boyd Malvo]] for shootings in 2002. A jury convicted him of murder but spared him a potential [[capital punishment|death sentence]]; it chose a sentence of "life in prison without parole" for the young man, who was 17 years old at the time of the crime spree. A jury in neighboring Virginia Beach convicted his older partner [[John Allen Muhammad]] and sentenced him to death for another of the attacks.

On November 22, 2022, [[2022 Chesapeake shooting|a mass shooting]] occurred in a [[Walmart]] off of [[Battlefield Boulevard]] in Chesapeake. Seven people were killed, including the gunman who committed suicide, and four others were injured.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Reese |first=Brian |date=November 22, 2022 |title=Police: Multiple fatalities, injuries reported in shooting at Chesapeake Walmart |url=https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/chesapeake/police-respond-to-shooting-at-chesapeake-walmart/ |access-date=November 23, 2022 |website=[[WAVY-TV]] |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/us/chesapeake-virginia-walmart-shooting/index.html|title=The Walmart manager who killed 6 people just started spraying bullets in the break room, employee says|last=Yan|first=Holly|date=November 23, 2022|website=[[CNN]]|access-date=November 23, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/23/us/chesapeake-shooting-walmart-virginia.html|title=6 People are fatally shot at a Walmart in Virginia, the authorities say|last=Medina|first=Eduardo|date=November 23, 2022|website=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=November 23, 2022}}</ref>

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|351|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|341|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|10|sqmi}} (2.9%) is water.<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>

The northeastern part of the [[Great Dismal Swamp]] is located in Chesapeake.

===Environment===
Chesapeake is one of the larger cities in Virginia and the nation in terms of land area. This poses challenges to city leaders in supporting infrastructure to serve this area. In addition, the city has many historically and geographically distinct communities. City leaders are faced with conflicts between development of residential, commercial and industrial areas and preservation of virgin forest and [[wetlands]]. Within the city limits in the southwestern section is a large portion of the [[Great Dismal Swamp]].

===Communities===
Chesapeake consists of six boroughs: South Norfolk, Butts Road, Deep Creek, Pleasant Grove, Western Branch and Washington. One of the boroughs, South Norfolk, used to be its own independent city and consolidated the surrounding portions of Norfolk County (extinct) into the City of Chesapeake.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the [[Köppen Climate Classification]] system, Chesapeake has a [[humid subtropical climate]], abbreviated "Cfa" on climate maps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=291844&cityname=Chesapeake%2C+Virginia%2C+United+States+of+America&units=|title=Chesapeake, Virginia Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|work=Weatherbase|access-date=21 May 2016}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
[[File:CA2158 30July2008 WilliamGrimes.JPG|200px|right|thumb|The [[Chesapeake and Albemarle Railroad]] is a shortline railroad in Chesapeake.]]

====Toll road<!--Toll roads if more than one is made-->====
[[Toll road|Tolls]] in Chesapeake are currently limited to the [[Chesapeake Expressway]], [[Veterans Bridge (Chesapeake, Virginia)|Veterans Bridge]] and the [[Jordan Bridge]], but new ones may be imposed on some existing facilities to help generate revenue for transportation projects in the region.

====Airports====
Chesapeake is served by the nearby [[Norfolk International Airport]] in the [[Norfolk, Virginia|City of Norfolk]] with [[airline|commercial airline]] passenger service.

Within the city limits, [[Chesapeake Regional Airport]] is a [[general aviation]] facility located just south of Great Bridge. Also, within the city, is the Hampton Roads Executive Airport located near Bowers Hill and the [[Hampton Roads Beltway]]. This airport caters to private airplane owners and enthusiasts. East of [[Great Bridge, Virginia|Great Bridge]], [[Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Fentress|NALF Fentress]] is a facility of the [[U.S. Navy]] and is an auxiliary landing field which is part of the large facility at [[Naval Air Station Oceana|NAS Oceana]] in neighboring [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]].

====River and ports====
The [[Intracoastal Waterway]] passes through Chesapeake. Chesapeake also has extensive frontage and port facilities on the navigable portions of the [[Western Branch Elizabeth River|Western]] and [[Southern Branch Elizabeth River|Southern]] Branches of the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]].

The [[Dismal Swamp Canal]] runs through Chesapeake as well. The site of this canal was surveyed by [[George Washington]], among others, and is known as "Washington's Ditch". It is the oldest continuously used man made canal in the United States today and has been in service for over 230 years. The canal begins in the [[Deep Creek, Virginia|Deep Creek]] section of the city branching off from the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River. The canal runs through Chesapeake paralleling [[U.S. Highway 17]] into [[North Carolina]] and connects to [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina]].

====Rail====
Five [[railroad]]s currently pass through portions of Chesapeake and handle some intermodal traffic at port facilities on Hampton Roads and navigable portions of several of its tributary rivers. The two major [[Class 1 railroad]]s are [[CSX Transportation]] and [[Norfolk Southern]], joined by three [[short line railroad]]s.

Chesapeake is located on a potential line for high-speed passenger rail service between Richmond and [[South Hampton Roads]] which is being studied by the [[Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation]]. A new suburban passenger station near Bowers Hill would potentially be included to supplement a terminal in downtown Norfolk.

====Highways====
* {{jct|state=VA|I|64|I|464|I|664|US|13|US|17|US|58|US|460|SR|168}}
* {{jct|state=NC|I-Future|87}}<!--Don't use State=VA as I-87 in VA page isn't created yet-->
Chesapeake is served by U.S. Highways [[U.S. Highway 13|13]], [[U.S. Highway 17|17]], [[U.S. Highway 58|58]], and [[U.S. Highway 460|460]]. [[Interstate 64]], part of the [[Hampton Roads Beltway]], crosses through the city, [[Interstate 464]] is a spur which connects it with downtown Norfolk and Portsmouth at the [[Berkley Bridge (Virginia)|Berkley Bridge]], and [[Interstate 664]], which completes the Interstate loop from the Western Branch section of Chesapeake through the city of Newport News and into the city of Hampton.

[[Route 168 (Virginia)|State Route 168]] is also a major highway in the area. It includes the [[Chesapeake Expressway]] [[toll road]].

Chesapeake is the only locality in the Hampton Roads area with a separate bridge division. The city's Department of Public Works, Bridges and Structures division has 51 full-time workers. The city maintains 90 bridges and overpasses. Included are five movable span (draw) bridges which open an estimated 30,000 times a year for water vessels.<ref name="content.hamptonroads.com">{{cite web|url=http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story=134154&ran=76168|title=Shutdown of Jordan Bridge for repairs puts spotlight on problem|work=hamptonroads.com|access-date=12 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210135417/http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story=134154&ran=76168|archive-date=2007-12-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Utilities===
Water and sewer services are provided by the city's Department of Utilities. Chesapeake receives its electricity from [[Dominion Virginia Power]] which has local sources including the Chesapeake Energy Center (a coal-fired and gas power plant), coal-fired plants in the city and [[Southampton County, Virginia|Southampton County]], and the Surry Nuclear Power Plant. Norfolk headquartered [[AGL Resources#Virginia Natural Gas|Virginia Natural Gas]], a subsidiary of [[AGL Resources]], distributes [[natural gas]] to the city from storage plants in [[James City County]] and in the city.

The Virginia tidewater area has grown faster than the local freshwater supply. Chesapeake receives the majority of its water from the Northwest River in the southeastern part of the city. To deal with intermittent high salt content, Chesapeake implemented an advanced [[reverse osmosis]] system at its Northwest River water treatment plant in the late 1990s. The river water has always been salty, and the fresh groundwater is no longer available in most areas. Currently, additional freshwater for the [[South Hampton Roads]] area is pumped from [[Lake Gaston]], about {{convert|80|mi|km}} west, which straddles the Virginia-North Carolina border along with the [[Blackwater River (Virginia)|Blackwater]] and [[Nottoway River|Nottaway]] rivers. The pipeline is {{convert|76|mi|km}} long and {{convert|60|in|mm}} in diameter. Much of its follows the former [[right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] of an abandoned portion of the [[Virginian Railway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginiaplaces.org/watersheds/lakegaston.html|title=Lake Gaston and Virginia Beach's Drinking Water|work=virginiaplaces.org|access-date=21 May 2016}}</ref> It is capable of pumping {{convert|60|e6USgal|m3}} of water per day. The cities of Chesapeake and Virginia Beach are partners in the project.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lake Gaston Water Supply Pipeline|url=https://www.vbgov.com/government/departments/public-utilities/about-pu/lake-gaston/Pages/default.aspx|website=www.vbgov.com|publisher=City of Virginia Beach|access-date=12 June 2016}}</ref>

The city provides wastewater services for residents and transports wastewater to the regional Hampton Roads Sanitation District treatment plants.<ref name="HRSD">{{cite web|title=Hampton Roads Sanitation District|url=http://www.hrsd.state.va.us/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121224132939/http://www.hrsd.state.va.us/|archive-date=2012-12-24|access-date=2008-03-08|publisher=Hampton Roads Sanitation District}}</ref>
