The modern city of Jamshedpur was established in 1912. It was named after industrialist [[Jamshedji Tata]], who laid foundation of Asia's first steel plant in the city and established [[Tata Group]]. The city played active role in the World War I. It was a high value target during the Second World War. Following the independence of India, the city became part of Bihar. Jamshedpur was impacted severely by the communal riots in 1964 and 1979. It was also a centre of the statehood movement. In 2000, the city became part of newly-formed Jharkhand state.

A major commercial and industrial center in India, Jamshedpur is demographically diverse city. It has been ranked consistently as one of the cleanest cities in India by [[Swachh Survekshan|Swach Survekshan]]. The city is also ranked as 2nd in India in terms of quality of life. It is one of the fastest-growing global cities in the world. It is a local popular tourist destination known for its forests, ancient temples and royal palaces. Jamshedpur is one of the first Smart Cities in India along with [[Naya Raipur]]. It is the headquarters of the [[East Singhbhum]] district and is the [[List of million-plus agglomerations in India|36th – largest urban agglomeration]] and [[List of cities in India by population|72nd largest city in India by population]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=31 December 2019 |title=Indore, Jamshedpur lead Swachh 2020 table |url=https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/indore-jamshedpur-lead-swachh-2020-table/article30446172.ece |access-date=1 May 2022 |work=The Hindu |issn=0971-751X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Swachh Survekshan2019 |url=https://swachhsurvekshan2019.org/Rankings/Morethan1Lakh |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831082122/https://swachhsurvekshan2019.org/Rankings/Morethan1Lakh |archive-date=31 August 2019 |access-date=17 November 2019 |website=swachhsurvekshan2019.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=International Finance Conference 2024 |url=https://ifc.xlri.ac.in/conference-venue/about-city |access-date=26 June 2024 |website=ifc.xlri.ac.in}}</ref> Jamshedpur is the only million plus city in India without a municipal corporation.

== Etymology ==
In 1919 [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] named the city, which was early a village called [[Sakchi]], to Jamshedpur in honour of its founder, [[Jamshedji Tata|Jamshedji Nausserwanji Tata]], whose birthday is celebrated on 3 March as Founder's Day. J.N. Tata had written to his son Dorabji Tata about his vision of a great city in the area.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dutta |first=Maya |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecJOAQAAIAAJ&q=jamshedpur |title=Jamshedpur: the growth of the city and its regions |publisher=Asiatic Society |year=1977}}</ref> On Founders Day, the 225-acre (0.91&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) [[Jubilee Park, Jamshedpur|Jubilee Park]] is decorated with brilliant lightwork for about a week.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Maji |first=Bivu |date=18 March 2021 |title=Jubilee Park (जुबली पार्क), Jamshedpur |url=https://welcometojamshedpur.in/jubilee-park-jamshedpur/ |access-date=3 February 2023 |website=Welcome to Jamshedpur}}</ref>

The city has several nicknames including "Steel City" (which was referenced during TATA Steel's "Green City—Clean City—Steel City" campaign); "Tatanagar" after the name of its railway station [[Tatanagar Railway Station]] or simply "Tata" in deference to the presence of [[Tata Group|Tata]] companies.<ref name="Bhatia 2004">{{cite web |last1=Bhatia |first1=Parvinder |date=3 December 2004 |title=Tata draws growth map |url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1041203/asp/jharkhand/story_4078479.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821125526/https://www.telegraphindia.com/1041203/asp/jharkhand/story_4078479.asp |archive-date=21 August 2017 |work=The Telegraph |location=India}}</ref> At one time it was also known as "Kalimati" (meaning "Land of Goddess Kali") after the village near the Sakchi area.<ref name="Bhatia 2004" /> Sakchi was merged Jamshedpur as a neighborhod in 1919.<ref name="Bhatia 2004" /> The only trace of the name is the main road through Sakchi area of Jamshedpur which is named Kalimati Road.<ref name="Bhatia 2004" />

== History ==

=== Foundation and early history ===
[[File:JAMSETJI N. TATA.jpg|left|thumb|Jamshedji Tata, founder of Tata Group]]
At the end of 19th century [[Jamshedji Nusserwanji Tata]] met steel makers in [[Pittsburgh]] to get the most advanced technology for his plant. It is said that he got the idea of building a steel plant when he heard [[Thomas Carlyle]] declaring that "the nation which gains control of iron soon acquires the control of gold" in a lecture in [[Manchester]]. At the turn of the twentieth century, [[Jamshetji Tata]] asked geologist Charles Page Perin to help him find the site to build India's first steel plant. The search for a site rich in iron, coal, limestone and water began in April 1904 in today's [[Madhya Pradesh]].

The prospectors C. M. Weld, [[Dorabji Tata]] and [[Shapurji Saklatvala]], took nearly three years in a painstaking search across vast stretches of inhospitable terrain to find a location.<ref name="Tatasteel100.com 1908">{{cite web |date=27 February 1908 |title=Sakchi- an end to the search of Iron-ore in Steel making process |url=http://www.tatasteel100.com/heritage/history/history04.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712004452/http://www.tatasteel100.com/heritage/history/history04.asp |archive-date=12 July 2012 |access-date=13 July 2012 |publisher=Tatasteel100.com}}</ref> One day they came across a village called [[Sakchi]], on the densely forested stretches of the [[Chota Nagpur plateau]], near the confluence of the [[Subarnarekha River|Subarnarekha]] and [[Kharkai River|Kharkai]] rivers.<ref name="Tatasteel100.com 1908" /> It seemed to be the ideal choice and the place was selected.<ref name="Tatasteel100.com 1908" /> In 1908 the construction of the plant as well as the city officially began.<ref name="Tatasteel100.com 1908" /> The first steel ingot was rolled on 16 February 1912.<ref name="Tatasteel100.com 1908" /> It was a momentous day in the history of industrial India.<ref name="Tatasteel100.com 1908" />

Jamshedpur's transformation from a rural area to a bustling urban center owes much to the establishment of [[Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited]] in 1907.

[[Dhalbhumgarh Airport]] is a proposed public airport located at [[Dhalbhumgarh]], in the state of [[Jharkhand]], India as a [[greenfield airport]] for Jamshedpur. It will be built on the site of an abandoned World War II airfield situated {{cvt|60|km}} from Jamshedpur on NH-33. The old airfield was built around 1948, as an ancillary runway for other airfields in the vicinity that were being built around India's eastern frontier as part of the war effort.

It was one of the airfields used by Allied forces to repel the advancing Japanese troops and to maintain transport links with China. As the Japanese forces came to control shipping in the China Sea, seaborne supply routes to China were cut and the difficult {{cvt|500|km|adj=on}} route over the Himalayas was increasingly used. The airfield was abandoned after the war. The technical team of the [[Airports Authority of India]] (AAI) conducted a survey in 2017 and approved the Dhalbhumgarh site for a greenfield airport. The government plans to invest Rs 300 crore through AAI for the new airport which will have a {{convert|3|km|spell=in|adj=on}} runway. In January 2018, Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation [[Jayant Sinha]] announced that the Union Civil Aviation Ministry and the Jharkhand Government would sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the construction of Dhalbhumgarh Airport.
