==History==
[[File:Lobito.thumb.jpg|thumb|left|Coat of arms of during the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonial period]].]]
The city was founded in 1843 and owes its existence to the bay of the same name having been chosen as the sea terminus of the [[Benguela railway]] to the far interior, passing through [[Luau, Moxico|Luau]] to [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] in  the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].<ref>W. Martin James, ''Historical Dictionary of Angola'', Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2018, p. 208</ref> The city is located on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean.  The population of the municipality is 393,079 (2014) in an area of 3,648&nbsp;km².<ref>[http://censo.ine.gov.ao/xportal/xmain?xpid=censo2014&xpgid=provincias&provincias-generic-detail_qry=BOUI=10505361&actualmenu=10505361 Census 2014] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060435/http://censo.ine.gov.ao/xportal/xmain?xpid=censo2014&xpgid=provincias&provincias-generic-detail_qry=BOUI=10505361&actualmenu=10505361 |date=4 March 2016 }}, preliminary results</ref> The municipality consists of the [[Communes of Angola|communes]] Canjala, Egipto Praia and Lobito.

===Portuguese rule===
Lobito, was built on a sandspit and reclaimed land, with one of Africa's finest [[natural harbour]]s, protected by a 5&nbsp;km long sandspit. The old municipality (''[[concelho]]'') was created in 1843 by the [[Portuguese West Africa|Portuguese administration]]. The town was also founded in 1843 by order of [[Maria II of Portugal]], and its harbour works were begun in 1903.

It wasn't until 1843 that [[Maria II of Portugal]] approved the foundation of the town, which had by then been known as Catumbela das Ostras (''Catumbela of Oysters'')<ref>{{cite web |url=http://destinobenguela.com/provincia/municipios/lobito.html |title=Lobito - A cidade dos flamingos |publisher=destinobenguela.com |access-date=22 March 2016 |language=pt |archive-date=2 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402035301/http://destinobenguela.com/provincia/municipios/lobito.html |url-status=live }}</ref>
[[File:Lobito restinga2.jpg|thumb|left|Lobito coast.]]
Large developments, however, were not stimulated until the completion in 1928 of the important [[Benguela Railway]], which connected [[Portuguese Angola]] with the [[Belgian Congo]].

Under Portuguese rule, the port was one of Angola's busiest, and the busiest of Africa, exporting [[Agriculture in Angola|agricultural]] produce from the interior and handling transit trade from the mines of southeastern Belgian Congo and of [[Northern Rhodesia]]. [[Fishing in Angola|Fishing]], tourism and services were also important. The [[carnival]] in Lobito was also one of the most renowned and popular in Portuguese Angola.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXWbB48O01A LobitoAnosOuro.wmv] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211002135246/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXWbB48O01A |date=2021-10-02 }}, a film of the Lobito in [[Portuguese Angola]], before independence from [[Portugal]]</ref>

===Post-independence===

After the 25 April 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]] in Lisbon, Angola was offered independence. Lobito's port activities were highly limited by disruptions to railway transit and high insecurity during the [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975–2002). With peace and stability, in the 2000s, Lobito started the process of reconstruction and resumed its path to development.

== Climate ==
Lobito experiences a mild tropical [[arid climate]] with few temperature extremes. The winters are extremely dry and warm, while summers are relatively wet and hotter.
