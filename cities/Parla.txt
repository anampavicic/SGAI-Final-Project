'''Parla''' ({{IPA|es|ˈpaɾ.la}}) is a [[municipality]] in the [[Community of Madrid]], Spain. It is located in the southern part of the region, approximately 20&nbsp;km from the capital, [[Madrid]].

== History ==
[[File:Parla - Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de la Asunción 2.jpg|thumb|275px|left|The Church of ''Nuestra Señora de la Asunción'', more commonly known as ''Iglesia Vieja'' ("Old Church"), the oldest church in the municipality.]]

=== Origins ===
Earliest evidence of human occupation includes stone tools made of [[Paleolithic]] [[chert]], of the kind utilized by [[Stone Age]] people. Starting in approximately 200 [[Common Era|CE]], [[nomad]]ic people from the coast began to settle the area, bringing their knowledge of metalworking (copper), [[ranching]], [[agriculture]], and [[weaving]]. These early settlers lived primarily along the Humanejos stream.

During the 4th and 5th centuries, the ranks of the local populations swelled to include newly arrived [[Celt]]ic tribes from [[central Europe]]. The Celts brought with them various advanced technologies that included ironworking and fired ceramics. The local population was sustained mostly by ranching and agriculture.

Independent local development was interrupted by the arrival of the [[Carthage|Carthagineans]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], the latter of whom recorded the history of the pre-Roman villages of the area. Local Roman artifacts include a number of grave markers and coins.

After the [[Battle of Guadalete]] (711), which signified the beginning of the [[Islamic conquest of Hispania]], Parla and its inhabitants were a part of the territory governed by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. Parla once again appeared as an independent township during the [[Reconquista]].

=== Modern times ===
The territory was part of the [[Alfoz]] of Madrid, a Spanish medieval territorial designation for the land surrounding a village during the [[Reconquista]]. At the time, there were two major villages in the area: Parla, to the north, and Humanejos to the south. Humanejos disappeared around the year 1650.

The first document to reference Parla is a letter which [[King of Spain|King]] [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] wrote on 6 January 1338 in [[Trujillo, Cáceres|Trujillo]], ceding control of the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of Parla to the cardinal as payment for his help in the fight against the Moors. This document was later affirmed by King [[Peter of Castile]] on 7 December 1351.

After the [[Peninsular War]], Parla became home to a large number of [[refugee]]s from other localities. Around this time it achieves the status of township.

== Politics and government ==
[[File:Antiguo Ayuntamiento de Parla.jpg|thumb|left|Old Town Hall with the flags of Spain, Europe and the community of Madrid]]
The current mayor is [[José María Fraile]] ([[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]]), who was elected in 2008. The previous mayor, [[Tomás Gómez Franco]], resigned from his post in October 2008 to accept the position of secretary general of the PSOE.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/10/23/madrid/1224762889.html |title=Tomás Gómez: 'Ayer fue el día que más he llorado en mi vida |access-date=2009-03-11 |publisher=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |date=2008-10-23 |language=es}}</ref>

The majority of local politics involves three of the major political parties: the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), the [[Popular Party (Spain)|Popular Party (PP)]], and the [[United Left (Spain)|United Left (IU)]].

During the [[Spanish regional elections, 2007|2007 Spanish regional elections]], the PSOE carried 74.43% of the vote and retained 20 town councillors. In comparison, the People's Party carried only 16.61% of the vote (4 councillors), while the IU carried 6.15% (1 councillor).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elpais.com/comunes/2007/elecciones/municipales/Parla/28/106/ |title=Resultados de las elecciones municipales de 2007 |access-date=2009-03-11 |work=[[El País]] |date=2007-05-28 |language=es |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531072305/http://www.elpais.com/comunes/2007/elecciones/municipales/Parla/28/106/ |archive-date=31 May 2007  }}</ref> The other political parties were unable to obtain sufficient votes to gain representation on the town council.

Local elections take place every four years, and are held in conjunction with the autonomous elections of the [[Community of Madrid]]. The next elections will take place in the year 2011.

The local government is divided into the following departments (called ''concejalía''):

== Location ==
[[File:(Parla) Madrid ESA354454 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Parla as seen by the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Sentinel-2]].]]
The municipality of Parla covers an area of 24.43&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. It borders six municipalities of the community of Madrid: [[Fuenlabrada]] to the North; [[Torrejón de Velasco]] and [[Torrejón de la Calzada]] to the South; [[Pinto, Madrid|Pinto]] to the East; and [[Griñón]] and [[Humanes de Madrid]] to the West.

Its elevation is 648.5 meters above [[sea level]].

== Demographics ==
=== Evolution ===
At the beginning of the 20th century, Parla had a population of 1,237. The municipality then underwent a population explosion, until reaching its current population of 150,000 ([[Instituto Nacional de Estadística (Spain)|INE]] 2008).

The majority of population growth occurred during the late 1960s due to the major urban migration that was occurring in Spain at the time. Between 1960 and 1970, the population grew 470%, from 1,809 inhabitants to 10,317. This migration continued at an elevated rate during the 1970s, as people from [[Castile-La Mancha|Castilla-La Mancha]], [[Andalusia]] and [[Extremadura]] settled in the area in order to commute to Madrid.

Starting in 1996, Parla once more began to experience a noticeable population growth, this time due to [[immigration]] from [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], [[Romania]], Poland, and [[sub-saharan Africa]]. This trend continues today.
