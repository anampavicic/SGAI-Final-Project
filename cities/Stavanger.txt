The [[#Climate|climate of the city]] is very mild by [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] standards due to a strong [[oceanic climate|maritime influence]]. As a result, winter usually remains above freezing whereas heat waves are rare and seldom long. Rainfall is common, although less so than in areas further north on the coastline.

Stavanger is served by international airport [[Stavanger Airport, Sola]], which offers flights to cities in most major European countries, as well as a limited number of intercontinental charter flights. The airport was rated as one of the world's most punctual airports of its category by [[OAG (company)|OAG]] in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Worldwide |first=OAG Aviation |title=Punctuality League 2020 Report |url=https://www.oag.com/punctuality-league-2020-report |access-date=2022-12-20 |website=www.oag.com |language=en-gb}}</ref>

Every two years, Stavanger organizes the Offshore Northern Seas (ONS), which is the second largest exhibition and conference for the energy sector. The Gladmat food festival is also held each year and is considered to be one of Scandinavia's leading food festivals. The city is also known for being one of the nation's premier culinary clusters. Stavanger was awarded the 2008 [[European Capital of Culture]] alongside [[Liverpool]].

==History==
[[File:Iron age farm Ullandhaug in Stavanger.jpg|thumb|[[Iron Age]] farm]]
The first traces of settlement in the Stavanger region come from the days when the ice retreated after the last ice age c. 10,000 years ago. A number of historians have argued convincingly that North-[[Jæren]] was an economic and military center as far back as the 9th and 10th centuries with the consolidation of the nation at the [[Battle of Hafrsfjord]] around 872. Stavanger grew into a center of church administration and an important south-west coast [[market town]] around 1100–1300.<ref>''Phenomenology and the pioneer settlement on the Western Scandinavian Peninsula''  (Ingrid Fuglestvedt (2009) Lindome : Bricoleur Press) {{ISBN|978-91-85411-07-8}}</ref>
[[File:Dom at night - Stavanger, Norway - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|[[Stavanger Cathedral]], the oldest [[cathedral]] in Norway.]]

Stavanger fulfilled an urban role prior to its status as city (1125), from around the time the Stavanger bishopric was established in the 1120s. Bishop Reinald, who may have come from [[Winchester]], England, is said to have started construction of [[Stavanger Cathedral]] (''Stavanger domkirke'') around 1100.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Ancient See of Stavanger |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/16076a.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210305052334/https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/16076a.htm |archive-date=5 March 2021 |access-date=4 April 2011 |website=newadvent.org}}</ref> It was finished around 1125, and the city of Stavanger counts 1125 as its year of foundation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=UArctic Education – Student Portal |url=http://www.uarctic.org/SingleNewsArticle.aspx?m=668&amid=6229 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707155026/http://www.uarctic.org/SingleNewsArticle.aspx?m=668&amid=6229 |archive-date=7 July 2014 |access-date=7 February 2016 |website=uarctic.org}}</ref>

With the [[Protestant Reformation]] in 1536, Stavanger's role as a religious center declined, and the establishment of [[Kristiansand]] in the early 17th century led to the relocation of the bishopric. However, rich herring fisheries in the 19th century gave the city new life.

Stavanger was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see [[formannskapsdistrikt]]). On 1 January 1867, a small area of [[Hetland]] municipality (population: 200) was transferred to the city of Stavanger. Again on 1 January 1879, another area of Hetland (population: 1,357) was transferred to Stavanger. Then again on 1 January 1906, the city again annexed another area of Hetland (population: 399). On 1 July 1923, part of Hetland (population: 3,063) was moved to the city once again. Finally on 1 July 1953, a final portion of Hetland (population: 831) was moved to Stavanger. In the 1960s, the work of the [[Schei Committee]] pushed for many municipal mergers across Norway. As a result of this, on 1 January 1965, the city of Stavanger (population: 51,470) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of [[Madla (municipality)|Madla]] (population: 6,025) and most of [[Hetland]] (population: 20,861).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jukvam |first=Dag |year=1999 |title=Historisk oversikt over endringer i kommune – og fylkesinndelingen |url=http://www.ssb.no/emner/00/90/rapp_9913/rapp_9913.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901160307/http://www.ssb.no/emner/00/90/rapp_9913/rapp_9913.pdf |archive-date=1 September 2012 |access-date=5 May 2016 |publisher=[[Statistics Norway|Statistisk sentralbyrå]] |language=no}}</ref>

===City development===
{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}
Stavanger is one of [[Norway]]'s [[List of towns and cities in Norway|oldest cities]]. It emerged in the 12th century during a period of population growth and increasing urbanisation throughout [[northern Europe]]. The [[archaeological]] and historical sources about the first city development are sparse. Therefore, there is much we do not know about the first city development. It stands out as an important area from early times, as a desirable foothold for the [[monarchy]] and the church, as both needed a strong foothold in the [[Western Norway|South West coast]] area. In North [[Jæren]], rich archaeological material suggests that the chiefs held considerable power from the early [[Iron Age]]. Stavanger had a natural harbor and was, with Jæren in the south, strategically important to the county of the East as well as to the shipping route along the western coast and the fertile [[Ryfylke]] Islands in the north.

The earliest [[Christianity|Christian]] impulses in [[Norway]] came to Stavanger region through trade connections with Continental Europe and [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Great Britain]]. This flourished during the [[Viking]] era. In the mid 10th century, traditional Norse burial customs ceased in the Stavanger area, at the same time as the first Christian [[priests]] began their work. Big stone crosses are visible memorials of this early Christian age (including the Tjora and Kvitsøy). On the overland approach to Stavanger, a memorial cross of HERS and [[lendmann]] [[Erling Skjalgsson]] was erected after his fall in 1028. Erling controlled power over the South West coast, and the location of the cross indicates that he had a special connection to Stavanger. The inscription on the cross shows a priest was responsible for the inscription, and he may have performed an early service at a church on site.

Archaeological investigations in the current downtown and in the crypt of the [[Stavanger Cathedral|Cathedral]] show that the great fire of 1272 probably left large parts of the city and the cathedral in ruins, including the Romanesque chancel of the cathedral. The reconstruction after the fire led to the cathedral's Western Front being replaced with a vestibule, as well as to the construction (or reconstruction) of [[St. Mary]]'s Church, Bishop's Chapel, the Gothic cathedral and the expansion of the stone cellar at [[Kongsberg]].

Stavanger has a long history of education in [[Western Europe]]. It was the monastery here that first saw the need to train new employees through education. The first organized teaching in the city probably took place at a Benedictine monastery in the town, either Olav's Monastery or Monastery of people from the mid-12th century.

One of the most important events in Stavanger's city history was the gift letter that King [[Magnus Erlingsson]] gave to Stavanger Bishop Eirik Ivarsson in the second half of the 1100s. Exactly when the king made this gift letter, and under what circumstances it happened, is unknown. It may have been in 1163–1164, in connection with the King Magnus's coronation, but could also have been around 1181–1184, in connection with the support Stavanger Bishop Erik gave King Magnus at the end of the king's fight against the late [[King Sverre]].

It is undoubtedly correct to characterize Stavanger as a church city throughout the [[Middle Ages]], up to the [[Reformation]]. The Reformation, however, dealt a hard blow to the Church in specific and Stavanger in general. The cathedral, the bishop and canons of the monastery had been large landowners. Recession of the city began with the loss of people in rural areas, as a result of which the revenues of the cathedral and the bishop fell dramatically due to reduced rental income. In 1537 the bishop's and the monastery's estate and property was confiscated by the king. Kongsberg was plundered by Christoffer Trondsen in 1539, at which time St. Swithun's casket disappeared and Bishop Hoskuld Hoskuldsson may have been executed.

===World War II===
{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}
In a prelude to the invasion, on 8 April, the German freighter {{MS|Roda|1928|2}} (6,780 grt.) anchored by Ulsnes. ''Roda'' was reportedly loaded with [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], but customs officials and police authorities became suspicious about other cargo when they observed that the ship was not riding deep in the water. The ship was boarded and was ordered to move to Riska. However, ''Roda'' did not move, and the captain of the {{HNoMS|Æger|1936|2}}, [[Niels Larsen Bruun]], decided on his own initiative to sink the ship. After sending the crew off in lifeboats, ''Æger'' used 25 shots with {{cvt|10|cm|adj=on}} Bofors guns to sink ''Roda''.

Early on the morning of 9 April 1940, explosions and bomb blasts from [[Sola, Norway|Sola]]-edge and news bulletins on radio announced the German attack on [[Norway]]. [[Stavanger Airport, Sola|Sola Airport]] was the Germans' first target on North [[Jæren]]. The airport was attacked by six German Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighters at around 8 am. The airport had been built in 1937, and in April 1940 fortifications round the airport were not yet complete. Fortifications consisted of a concrete [[bunker]] still under construction and several open shooting positions. Armament consisted of three heavy anti-aircraft machine guns, three heavy machine guns configured for ground targets, and some light machine guns at the disposal of the approximately 80 soldiers who defended the airport. The bomber wing was transferred to Sola Airport in 1939, but the planes, a total of six Fokker and three Caproni aircraft, were old and outdated. Shortly after the attack began, however, they took off.

The German air attack increased in intensity. The [[bombardment]] lasted for about an hour before 10 slow Ju 52 transport aircraft arrived over the airport. They had taken off from the airport at [[Hamburg Airport|Hamburg]] a few hours earlier. In a parachute assault, the transport planes first dropped yellow containers containing weapons and equipment, then between 10 and 12 paratroopers from each plane. This was only the second ever wartime parachute assault; the first had occurred only three hours earlier, when a bridge south of [[Denmark]] was captured in the same way. At the Sola airport, the concrete bunker held out longest, but was eventually put out of action with a hand grenade. While [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[soldier]]s were badly injured in the attempted defense, there were no fatalities; in contrast, the Germans lost several. Lieutenant Thor Tang, who led the Norwegian defense of the airport, capitulated at 10:00, and the Germans immediately began landing troops, fuel and other supplies. In all, 200 to 300 transport aircraft arrived in Sola during invasion day, and by evening several hundred soldiers and large quantities of materiel had been moved from Germany to Sola.

By around 12:30 on 9 April, the first German troops advanced into Stavanger without resistance. The police station, telephone office, telegraph center, post office, port office, customs house and the gas company were the most important places, and now came under control of the Germans. The city was conquered without conflict, but the first sparks of resistance had been ignited, and several men left the city and made their way to the Norwegian troops inside [[Gjesdal]], there to join the armed struggle against the enemy.

The Germans had placed a high priority to have a good railway connection between the air base at [[Sola, Norway|Sola]] – Stavanger district, and the rest of the [[Norway|country]]. However, it was not until 29 April 1944, that the [[Sørlandsbanen|Southern Railway]] was completed to Stavanger. In 1940, the [[Germans]] had envisioned it to be completed no later than 1 November 1941.

After [[Hitler]]'s death in 1945, Grand Admiral [[Karl Dönitz]] took over leadership of the German forces, and on 9 May 1945, gave the head of the German armed forces in Norway, General [[Franz Böhme]], orders that "Reichskommissar" in Norway, Josef Terboven, was deposed and that all his duties were transferred to Böhme. To Böhme, in turn, he gave the task of how the capitulation of Festung Norwegen was to be implemented. There were around 15,000 German soldiers in [[Rogaland]] in 1945, and it was there where the commander of 274 Infantry Division, General Weckman, gave the formal German surrender.

Before repatriation, the Germans were required to remain and clean up after five years of occupation. There were 180 German minefields in [[Rogaland]], with a total of 480,000 mines, all of which the German Wehrmacht were required to clear. Sixty-two Germans were killed and 94 were injured during mine clearance in Rogaland. Mines from this period continue to be uncovered.<ref>{{Cite web |date=16 February 2017 |title=Minefunn på Hellestøstranden |url=https://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/i/G7aMq/Minefunn-pa-Hellestostranden |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826183058/https://www.aftenbladet.no/lokalt/i/G7aMq/Minefunn-pa-Hellestostranden |archive-date=26 August 2018 |access-date=26 August 2018}}</ref>

===Oil capital===
[[File:StatfjordA(Jarvin1982).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Petroleum|oil]] industry is the backbone of Stavanger's economy.]]
In 1969, a new boom started as [[Petroleum|oil]] was first discovered in the [[North Sea]].
<ref name="Stavanger kommune - Byhistorie"/>
After much discussion, Stavanger was chosen to be the on-shore center for the oil industry on the [[Norway|Norwegian]] sector of the North Sea, and a period of hectic growth followed.<ref name="Stavanger kommune - Byhistorie"/>

In March 1965 an agreement was signed between [[Norway]] and the [[United Kingdom]] on the sharing of the continental shelf by the median line principle. That same year a similar agreement was signed between Norway and [[Denmark]]. It was designed as a legal regime for oil exploration. The first licensing round on the Norwegian shelf was announced on 13 April 1965, and in August of that same year the government granted 22 licenses for 78 blocks for oil companies or groups of companies. The production license gave oil companies exclusive rights to exploration, drilling and production in a defined geographical area for a given period at an annual fee. [[Esso]] was the first oil company to start drilling for oil off the coast of Norway. The semi-submersible drilling vessel [[Ocean Traveler]] was towed from [[New Orleans]] to Norway, and the vessel began drilling on 19 July 1966, at block 8/3, about {{cvt|180|km}} southwest of Stavanger.

===Coat of arms===
[[Hallvard Trætteberg]] (1898–1987), a leading specialist in heraldry, was commissioned to design the official [[coat of arms]] of Stavanger, a work that lasted from the end of the 1920s until approved on 11 August 1939. His design is also used as the city's arms, flag, and seal. The coat of arms is based upon a seal which dated from 1591. It shows a branch of [[vine]] (''[[Vitis vinifera]]''). Which leaves and branch type that is depicted on the coat of arms has been hotly debated. The original meaning and representation of the vine remains unknown.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=June 1964 |title=The Coat of Arms of Norway |journal=The American-Scandinavian Review}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Civic heraldry of Norway – Norske Kommunevåpen |url=http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Stavanger |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806085101/http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Stavanger |archive-date=6 August 2016 |access-date=4 May 2016 |publisher=Heraldry of the World}}</ref>

===Origin of the name===
The [[Old Norse]] form of the name was ''Stafangr''. The origin of the name has been discussed for decades, and the most used interpretation is that it originally was the name of the inlet now called Vågen, which was the original site of the city, on the east shore of the bay.<ref name="snl" />

The first element of the name is ''stafr'' meaning 'staff' or 'branch'. This could refer to the form of the inlet, but also to the form of the mountain Valberget (''Staven'' meaning 'the staff,' is a common name of high and steep mountains in Norway). The last element is ''angr'' meaning 'inlet, bay'. Facing the [[North Sea]], Stavanger has always been economically dependent on its access to the sea.<ref name="snl" />

==Government==
Stavanger Municipality is responsible for [[primary education]] (through 10th grade), outpatient [[Health care|health services]], [[old age|senior citizen]] services, [[welfare]] and other [[Social work|social services]], [[zoning]], [[economic development]], and municipal [[road]]s and utilities. The municipality is governed by a [[Municipal council (Norway)|municipal council]] of [[Direct election|directly elected]] representatives. The [[mayor]] is [[Indirect election|indirectly elected]] by a vote of the municipal council.<ref name="ks">{{Cite encyclopedia |title=kommunestyre |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |publisher=[[Kunnskapsforlaget]] |url=https://snl.no/kommunestyre |date=2022-09-20 |editor-last=Hansen |editor-first=Tore |language=Norwegian |editor2-last=Vabo |editor2-first=Signy Irene |accessdate=2022-10-14}}</ref> The municipality is under the jurisdiction of the [[Sør-Rogaland District Court]] and the [[Gulating Court of Appeal]].

===Municipal council===
The [[Municipal council (Norway)|municipal council]] ({{lang|no|Kommunestyre}}) of Stavanger is made up of 67 representatives who are elected to four year terms. The tables below show the current and historical composition of the council by political [[Political party|party]].

In September 2024, [[Sissel Knutsen Hegdal|the mayor]] asked to be relieved of her duties; she is no longer a member of the Conservative Party; as of the first week of October, she has formally claimed that it would not be any significant disadvantage for her, to [continue to] take care of the office [that she holds, if authorities do not relieve her of her duties]; the municipal council is scheduled to vote (October 14) in regard to - if she should be relieved of her duties.<ref>https://www.vg.no/nyheter/i/4Bm4go/aftenbladet-politisk-sekretariat-i-stavanger-innstiller-paa-at-hegdal-ikke-faar-ordfoererfritak.

==Geography==
[[File:Saved (5676897195).jpg|thumb|A beach in Randaberg]]
The municipality of Stavanger is located in a coastal landscape, bordering the sea to the west and [[Boknafjorden]] in the northeast. The [[Byfjorden (Rogaland)|Byfjorden]] and [[Gandsfjorden]] run along the east side of the city. It is part of the Low-[[Jæren]], a flat area of land consisting mostly of marsh, sand, and stone aur, that ranges from Ogna River in the south to Tungenes in the north; it is the northernmost part that includes Stavanger. The majority of the municipality lies between {{cvt|0|and|50|m}} in elevation. The landscape has a distinctive appearance with rocks and hills where there is no settlement or agriculture. The city of Stavanger is closely linked to the sea and water, with five lakes (including [[Breiavatnet]], [[Stora Stokkavatnet]], and [[Mosvatnet]]) and three fjords ([[Hafrsfjorden]], [[Byfjorden (Rogaland)|Byfjorden]], and [[Gandsfjorden]]); sea and water form the landscape, providing a shoreline rich with vegetation and wildlife.

The terrain is low-lying: 49% of the area is less than {{cvt|20|m}} above sea level, While 7% of the land is at {{cvt|60|m}}. Stavanger's highest point is the {{cvt|514|m|adj=on}} tall Bandåsen.

The city has developed on both sides of a hollow that runs right through the terrain, with steep slopes up from the bottom. An extension of Boknafjorden and Byfjorden intersects the harbour into the hollow from the northwest, while Hillevåg lake intrudes from Gandsfjorden in the southeast. [[Breiavatnet]] is located between the two fjord arms.

The city includes many islands off the coast including: [[Bjørnøya, Stavanger|Bjørnøy]], [[Buøy]], [[Engøy]], [[Grasholmen]], [[Hellesøy, Stavanger|Hellesøy]], [[Hundvåg (island)|Hundvåg]], [[Kalvøy, Stavanger|Kalvøy]], [[Lindøy]], [[Sølyst, Stavanger|Sølyst]], and [[Vassøy]]. It also includes the eastern half of the island of [[Åmøy]].<ref name="snl">{{Cite web |last=Store norske leksikon |author-link=Store norske leksikon |title=Stavanger |url=https://snl.no/Stavanger |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305090752/https://snl.no/Stavanger |archive-date=5 March 2016 |access-date=27 April 2016 |language=no}}</ref>

===Parks===
{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}
[[File:Park in Stavanger - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The city park]]
There are several parks and green spots in Stavanger municipality, both in the city and beyond. Central to the town is the city lake which is in turn surrounded by the city park, built as the city's first urban park in 1866–1868. Between the city park and the bay is located [[Kielland]] garden, which got its name because the poet [[Alexander Kielland]]'s house at the time was here. Kielland Park went through a major renovation in 2007 as part of the Millennium in Stavanger municipality. At the opposite end of the city lake there is a small park outside the station; here there is [[Emigration]], a gift from the Norwegian emigrants in the [[United States]], commemorating the men and women of [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] ancestry who built America.

Bjergstedparken, a park north of [[Gamle Stavanger|Old Stavanger]], is the location of Bjergsted Music Center, including [[Stavanger Concert Hall]], and its outdoor areas are often used for festivals and outdoor concerts. The Missing park, built in honour of Lars Missing, is located up the hill on the west side of the harbour, and forms the entrance from the south towards the Old Town. Canon park forms the border between Stavanger and the exit from the [[European route E39|E39]]. Northward go Løkkeveien against Bjergsted westward go Madlaveien the theater and Bergelandstunnelen, east towards E39. The park is located next to old Stavanger Hospital, which also has a large park area around the main building. Through the park runs Kannik creek, which comes to the surface at the statue of the Little Mermaid and runs into Breiavannet. Kannikkbekken runs mostly underground, in pipes, before it reaches Kannik park.

Outside the city center, the park southerly in relation to the large inland lakes such as [[Mosvatnet]], [[Stora Stokkavatnet]] and Water Assen. Mosvatnet is {{cvt|0.46|km2|acres}} making it the third largest in Stavanger after Hålandsvatnet and Store Stokkavatn. The lake supplied the city's drinking water from 1863 to 1931, and is now by far the most used recreation area in Stavanger. The path around the lake is {{cvt|3.2|km}} long, and much used by cyclist and joggers; sampling conducted in 1995 showed that an estimated 560,000 people used the walking trail around Mosvatnet. At the south end is Mosvangen Camping, Stavanger Svømmestadion old man and Vålandskogen, and to the west is Rogaland Kunstmuseum. Stora Stokkavatnet is {{cvt|2.19|km2}} – the largest in Stavanger. Right at Stora Stokkavatnet is the {{cvt|0.15|km2|adj=on}} Litla Stokkavatnet. The hiking trail around the lakes is {{cvt|8.2|km}} long. In the lake is a small island, Storeholmen. Store Stokkavatnet supplied Stavanger's drinking water from 1931 to 1959, and was later demoted to the reserve drinking water. In 2009 it was relegated once more, and it is now legal to swim in the water.

===Climate===
Situated on the south west coast of Norway, Stavanger's climate is greatly influenced by the temperate water in the North Sea, and Atlantic lows giving mild westerlies also in winter. This creates warmer temperatures throughout the year compared to other cities at similar latitudes, and also gives plentiful precipitation in the form of rain, especially in late autumn and winter. 
According to [[Köppen climate classification]], Stavanger experiences a temperate [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'') with five months with a mean temperature above {{cvt|10|C}}. Spring and early summer is the driest season. The all-time high {{cvt|33.5|C}} at the airport was recorded August 1975. The warmest high recorded in Stavanger is {{cvt|34.4|C}} at the weather station Stavanger-Våland (72 m) in July 2018. The warmest month on record at Stavanger Airport is August 2002 with mean {{cvt|19.3|°C}} and average daily high {{cvt|23.2|°C}}. The all-time low {{cvt|-19.8|C}} was recorded January 1987. The coldest month on record is February 1963 with mean {{cvt|-5|°C}} and average daily low {{cvt|-9.6|°C}}. The average date for the last overnight freeze (low below {{convert|0|°C|1|abbr=on}}) in spring is April 20<ref>{{Cite web |date=4 May 2012 |title=Siste frostnatt om våren |url=https://www.yr.no/artikkel/siste-frostnatt-om-varen-1.8119060}}</ref> and average date for first freeze in autumn is October 31<ref>{{Cite web |date=25 September 2013 |title=Første frostnatt |url=https://www.yr.no/artikkel/forste-frostnatt-1.11261900}}</ref> giving a frost-free season of 193 days (Stavanger Airport Sola 1981–2010 average).

{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}
[[File:Hermetikkfabrikker i Stavanger.jpg|thumb|Canning factories in the early 20th century]]
In the early 20th century, Stavanger's industry was mainly related to fisheries and shipping. In the first half of the century it was known for [[canning]], and in the 1950s there were over 50 canneries in town. The town was even called Norway's "canned capital", and included [[Christian Bjelland I|Christian Bjelland]], who founded Chr Bjelland & Co. A/S. The last of these factories were closed down in 2002.

Around 1950, over half of the working population in the city was employed in [[Industrial sector|industry]]. Structural changes in industry and the strong development of the service sector have radically changed the city's economic base, and the service industry now represents over 11 percent of employment. However, the city still has 29 percent of the county's industrial [[employment]].

Engineering is now the main industry with 59 percent of manufacturing employment. This is mostly related to the offshore petroleum industry, and production of oil platforms alone account for 40 percent. Other important industries are publishing – especially high printing and the major daily newspapers in town, [[Stavanger Aftenblad|Stavanger and Rogaland Avis Aftenblad]] – and food and beverage, which includes the processing of local agricultural products from Jæren, including Gilde Vest with one of the largest slaughterhouses.

Employment by place of work and industry in 2007 to 0.6% in primary, 27.4% in secondary and tertiary industries 71.7%. Employment by place of work by sector in 2007 to 24.4% in the public sector and 75.6% in the private sector and public enterprises.

Industry has in recent years become highly decentralized. The most important of the newer industrial areas are [[Forus]] in the south, on the border of [[Sandnes]] and [[Sola, Norway|Sola]], and [[Dusavik]] (mainly petroleum-related activities) in the north, on the border of Randfontein. Significant older industrial areas are [[Hillevåg]], [[Buøy]], the eastern districts, and in some places elsewhere along the coast. Shipbuilding and shipping has also traditionally been of great importance to the city's economic growth, and Rosenberg Shipyard, established in 1896, is located on [[Hundvåg (island)|Hundvåg]]. Today Stavanger is also among the country's most important [[Sea|maritime]] cities, coming in fourth for registered fleets after the cities of [[Oslo]], [[Bergen]] and [[Ålesund]].

For the fourth consecutive year, [[Greater Stavanger|Stavanger Region]] was in 2007 ranked best business region. Telemarksforsking Bo worked with Ministry NM to rank the regions in [[Norway]] with regard to profitability, growth and new businesses.

===Media===
{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}
[[File:Aftenbladet.jpg|thumb|[[Stavanger Aftenblad]]]]

The city's largest daily newspaper, [[Stavanger Aftenblad]] came out with its first issue in 1893. Competitor [[Rogalands Avis]] was first published in 1899 under the name ''1ste Mai'' ('1 May'), and published daily. In 1987 an attempt was made to establish a new daily newspaper, The West Coast, but it was only released for two months and ended with a total loss of NOK 27 million.

The first newspaper published in Stavanger, "Stavangerske Adressecontoirs Efterretninger", was a handwritten weekly newspaper that probably came out in 1769 and 1770. This was not an ordinary newspaper, but a so-called link newspaper with the privilege of bringing out announcements, small articles and ads. The first ''printed'' newspaper in Stavanger, "Stavanger Addresseavis", published its first issue on Friday, 4 October 1833.

[[Stavanger Avis]] was published from 1888 until 1911. Writer and local Alexander L. Kielland was editor in 1889. Stavanger Avis was also the name of the newspaper that came out from 1942 to 1945, when Stavanger Aftenblad and Stavangeren were merged by the Press Directorate.

Student newspaper ''SMiS'' (Studentmediene i Stavanger) comes out every other month.

Stavanger has one principal television station, TV Vest, that sends local news and reports. Additionally, Viking TV, the channel for the football team [[Viking FK]], started on 2 March 2008, and is distributed via Lyse's broadband network, reaching 120,000 viewers in 45,000 households. [[NRK]] [[Rogaland]] supplies local news broadcasts on radio and television. Local radio stations also provide local news and reports.

===Agriculture and food===
{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}
The Stavanger region is often referred to as Norway's answer to the French food region of [[Lyon]]. The Culinary Institute, based in [[Ullandhaug]], used to provide a very important focus on food in Stavanger. After the Culinary Institute went bankrupt, partly due to activities in [[Oslo]] on 4 June 2008, a new culinary organization was established by the Foundation Rogaland knowledge park and [[Rogaland]] County Council. This new institute, now also known as The Culinary Institute, maintained parts of the work of the original organization, and eventually bought back the name, logo and brand ''Culinary Institute'' from the bankruptcy estate.

In summer 2007, the region's culinary actors were awarded the title "Norwegian Centers of Expertise in Culinology". The building under construction at Ullandhaug will serve as a platform and innovative arena, not only for the region's R & D environment, but also for other expertise among both industry and the public. In July 2008, the Stavanger European championship qualified for the Bocuse d'Or. In 2008, Norway was represented by Geir Skeie, who also won gold. Every year there is a "Happy Food Festival" in the city center. The festival originated in the network of [[Rogaland]] county so that they could impart culinary traditions of the region. By 2020, Stavanger region intends to be the region most Norwegians associate with food products and culinary experiences.

===Oil industry===
{{More citations needed section|dateMarch 2016|date=March 2016}}
In recent times, the city has come to be called the "oil capital," and Norway's national and largest oil company, [[Equinor]], is based at [[Forus]], in Stavanger. Equinor (at the time known as Statoil) was founded as a limited company owned by the [[Government of Norway]] on 14 July 1972 by a unanimous act passed by the Norwegian parliament [[Stortinget]], to enable Norwegian participation in the oil industry on the continental shelf, to build up Norwegian competency within the petroleum industry, and to establish the foundations of a domestic petroleum industry. Establishing Equinor's headquarters in Stavanger naturally led to Stavanger becoming the center of the oil industry. [[Petoro]], a Norwegian state-owned company responsible for managing the commercial aspects of the state's direct financial interest in petroleum activities on the Norwegian continental shelf, also has its headquarters in the city. With the center of the national oil industry in Stavanger, several other international oil companies have also made their headquarters in Stavanger.
[[File:Troll A Platform.jpg|thumb|The concrete base for the Troll A platform is cast in Vats, 55&nbsp;km north of Stavanger]]

NPD was created in 1972 by Ullandhaug and PSA was established on 1 January 2004 and co-located with the agency, as a regulatory body.

[[Jåttåvågen]], on [[Gandsfjorden]], was from the 1970s to the 1990s a large industrial area, particularly for the construction of large concrete Condeep platforms and oil platforms for the offshore industry. Among others, the Condeep jacket for the three Gullfaks platforms and Troll A were cast here by Norwegian Contractors.

Offshore Northern Seas is the second largest exhibition of its kind in the oil and gas industry. ONS takes place in Stavanger during the last week of August every other year. In 2008, there were 38,000 visitors, half of whom came from abroad.

===Airport===
[[File:Stavanger airport.jpg|thumb|[[Stavanger Airport, Sola]]]]
[[Stavanger Airport, Sola]], is located in [[Sola, Norway|Sola]], 14 minutes away from Stavanger city center. The airport opened in 1937.

[[File:Stavanger stasjon 2013-04-28 10.34.24.jpg|thumb|[[Stavanger Station|Stavanger S]]]]
[[Stavanger Station]] opened in 1878 and is the terminus of both the [[Sørlandet Line]] and the [[Jæren Line]].

[[Sørlandsbanen|The Southern Railway]] goes from [[Oslo Central Station]] to [[Drammen Station|Drammen]], to [[Kristiansand Station]], to, finally, [[Stavanger Station]]. This route, <!--CheckSm-->{{convert|545|km|mi|abbr=off}} between Oslo and Stavanger, is scheduled over four times every day and takes around seven hours. The railway was constructed in several phases, the first section being opened in 1871 and the last not opened until 1944. While there was continual construction work from [[Oslo]] westward as far as Moi, the [[Jæren Line]], from [[Egersund]] to Stavanger in [[Western Norway]], was opened in 1878. Up to 1913 the name used on plans and for the completed sections was the Vestlandet Line (The West Country Line).

There are also local trains in [[Jæren]] with 19 stops on one line. The line opened as a 1,067&nbsp;mm (3&nbsp;ft 6 in) narrow gauge stand-alone line on 27 February 1878. The railway was extended from [[Egersund]] to [[Flekkefjord]] as the [[Flekkefjord Line]] in 1904. The [[Jæren Line]]'s only branch, the [[Ålgård]] Line from [[Ganddal]] to [[Ålgård]], opened in 1924. In 1944, the [[Sørlandet Line]] was extended to [[Sira, Norway|Sira]] on the [[Flekkefjord Line]], and the [[Jæren Line]] was integrated into the main railway network. Because of this, the line was converted to standard gauge.

There is as of 2021 ongoing construction of [[Rogfast]], an undersea road tunnel that will facilitate travel between Stavanger and Haugesund.

===Sea===

Located outside Stavanger, there is a port serving ferries to [[Hirtshals]], Denmark. There have been advocates for the [[Smyril Line]] ferry between the [[Faroe Islands]] and Denmark to make a stop in Stavanger as the new port in Risavika allows this to be done while only adding one hour to the total sailing time.

Local ferries go to [[Tau, Norway|Tau]] and [[Kvitsøy]], while fast passenger boats go to many villages and islands between the main routes from Stavanger to [[Haugesund]] and [[Sauda]].

There are plans to re-establish the [[Newcastle–Bergen–Stavanger ferry|ferry link to Newcastle]] in the United Kingdom, which was suspended in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Adrian Pearson |date=27 August 2012 |title=North Shields to Norway ferry plan raises job hopes |url=http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/2012/08/27/north-shields-to-norway-ferry-plan-raises-job-hopes-61634-31703489/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110124318/http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/2012/08/27/north-shields-to-norway-ferry-plan-raises-job-hopes-61634-31703489/ |archive-date=10 November 2012 |access-date=27 August 2012 |website=journallive}}</ref>

===Film===
====Local filmmaking====
South West Film Forum was established in 1992 and is an organization of film workers in [[Rogaland]]. Its goal is to increase the skills of film workers in the region and encourage more filmmaking. Film Forum Southwest has received operating support from the City of Stavanger since 1995 and from the county since 1997. Additionally, they have received grants for film workshop from the county and for other industry-stimulating measures from Stavanger municipality.

Stavanger has since 1997 had a grant for the support of local filmmaking. The aim has been to stimulate the local film community growth and development, and to contribute to local filmmakers so they can initiate film projects that can then apply for production funding from other government agencies. In addition, they support the already completed projects – primarily to help cinemas display locally produced film.

The feature film ''[[Mongoland]]'' became a Norwegian film success, made outside the traditional infrastructure for [[Norwegian film]]. So far this has culminated with the establishment of the production company South West Film and [[Film Kraft Rogaland]], to ensure long-term fund allocations to filmproduksjoner. [[Arild Østin Ommundsen]] made his directorial debut with the feature film ''Mongoland'' in 2000 and has since directed and written the script for ''[[The Haunting (2003 film)|The Haunting]]'' (2003) and ''Monster Thursday'' (2005). Ommundsen helped start the new Stavanger wave that came after ''Mongoland'' premiered, and several of the actors who were instrumental have since enjoyed great success.

Stavanger native Stian Kristiansen, who had his acting breakthrough in the feature film "[[Mongoland]]", debuted as a feature film director with the film interpretation of Tore Renberg's book ''[[The Man Who Loved Yngve]]''. The film, of the same title, had its theatrical release on 15 February 2008. The film has received top marks in [[Norwegian media]], and was watched by over 30,000 people during the premiere weekend. In 2008, Kristiansen received Stavanger's screenplay scholarship.

On 30 September 2010, the film ''[[Nokas (film)|Nokas]]'', directed by [[Erik Skjoldbjærg]], premiered in Stavanger. The film is about the [[NOKAS robbery]] in Stavanger on 5 April 2004, and was filmed on location, using many of the locations where the factual event took place, such as the King Street counting center, in the Norway Bank building, and the Cathedral Square, by Maria Church Ruins. The family of the police officer who died during the robbery has not authorized the film.

===TV===
''[[Lykkeland]]'' ''("State of Happiness")'', a Norwegian drama series of so far 16 episodes in two seasons, premiered with the first season on [[NRK]]1 in 2018. The series is about the time when Norway enters the oil age and follows some families and people in Stavanger who experience great upheavals when the city goes from being a pietistic community with fishing, shipping and agriculture as main industries, to becoming an international, rich oil city. The second season premiered on 2 January 2022 and deals with dramatic events in the 1970s and 1980s.

The series won two awards during the newly started CannesSeries Festival in Cannes in 2018. The first season of the series won five awards during the Gullruten ("Golden Screen", Norway) 2019 – best drama series, best actress for Anne Regine Ellingsæter, best director TV drama for Petter Næss and Pål Jackman, best screenplay in TV drama for Mette Marit Bølstad and best costume for Karen Fabritius Gram. During the Gullruten 2022, the second season of the series won five awards, among them best supporting role for Pia Tjelta and best director TV drama for Petter Næss.

===European Capital of Culture 2008===

Stavanger and its region, along with [[Liverpool]], United Kingdom, was selected as a [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2008. The ''Stavanger2008'' vision is expressed through the concept "Open Port". This can be understood both in its English sense – "an open harbour" – and in its Norwegian meaning of "an open gate", together implying openness towards the world. The region and its people is supposed to be even more open and inclusive towards art, ideas and opportunities.

Stavanger was the host port of the [[Cutty Sark Tall Ships' Race]] in 1997 and 2004.

[[File:Cruise ship Stavanger Norway.jpg|thumb|150px|P&O MV Britannia cruise ship at berth near Strandkaien, Stavanger]]
[[File:Gamle Stavanger.jpg|thumb|[[Gamle Stavanger]]]]
Stavanger is a popular tourist destination, especially in summer. The hotels in the city enjoy high levels of occupancy all year round, due to the large number of commuters travelling to Stavanger, both for work and in order to attend meetings. In recent years, Stavanger has also become one of the most popular ports of call for cruise ships, with the number of cruise ships increasing steadily, making Stavanger one of [[Europe]]'s fastest growing ports of call for cruise ships north of the [[Mediterranean]].

Especially in the summertime, Stavanger's harbour is full of large cruiseships: in 2011 Stavanger hosted 130 cruiseships. The Port of Stavanger is a popular stop on the route to the Norwegian Fjords. The charming city center is just a small walk from the quay.

===Outdoor activities===
There are not many outdoor activities in Stavanger itself, however, splendid opportunities are nearby in adjacent municipalities: [[Lysefjorden]] is particularly popular for hiking.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Topping |first=Celia |date=2015-07-25 |title=Hanging with rock stars: affordable hikes in western Norway |url=http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jul/25/norway-hiking-walking-affordable-bus-stavanger |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210614033008/https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jul/25/norway-hiking-walking-affordable-bus-stavanger |archive-date=14 June 2021 |access-date=2021-02-19 |website=The Guardian |language=en}}</ref> Tourists typically visit places like [[Preikestolen]] (aka the Pulpit Rock), and [[Kjeragbolten]]. [[Preikestolen]] is a massive rock overhanging the fjord (604 metres below). [[Kjeragbolten]] is a rock wedged in the cliff approximately 1,000 metres above the fjord. The straight fall 1,000 metres down to the fjord makes [[Kjerag]] a very popular location for [[BASE jumping]].

Not too far from Stavanger, alpine centers are available for skiers and snowboarders throughout the winter season.

===City center===
Old Stavanger ([[Gamle Stavanger]]) is located right next to the city center and has a collection of 18th- and 19th-century wooden structures.

[[Stavanger domkirke]] (St. Swithun's cathedral) was built between 1100 and 1150 by the English bishop Reinald in [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] style, and in the late 13th century a new choir was added in [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] style, with a vaulted roof. The cathedral is the only Norwegian cathedral that is almost unchanged since the 14th century.
