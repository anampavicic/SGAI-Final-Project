{{Nihongo|'''Tokorozawa'''|所沢市|Tokorozawa-shi}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] located in [[Saitama Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. {{As of|2024|02|01}}, the city had an estimated [[population]] of 343,298 in 168,939 households and a [[population density]] of 4761 persons per km².<ref name="Tokorozawa-hp">{{cite web |url=https://www.city.tokorozawa.saitama.jp/shiseijoho/data/jinkou/saishin.html|title= Tokorozawa city official statistics|location= Japan|language= ja}}</ref> The total area of the city is {{convert|72.11|sqkm|sqmi}}.

==Geography==
Tokorozawa is located in the central part of the [[Musashino Terrace]] in southern Saitama, about 30&nbsp;km west of central Tokyo. Tokorozawa can be considered part of the greater Tokyo area; its proximity to the latter and lower housing costs make it a popular [[commuter town]]. The Higashikawa and Yanasegawa rivers that flow from the Sayama Hills flow to the eastern part of the city, and finally reach the Arakawa River. The Yamaguchi Reservoir (commonly known as [[Lake Sayama]]) is mostly located within city boundaries; [[Lake Tama]] also touches the south-western part of the city.

The area around [[Tokorozawa Station]]'s west exit is built up as a shopping district with several department stores.  Prope Street is a popular shopping arcade.

==History==
Archaeological research has shown that the vicinity of Tokorozawa was settled from about 20,000 years ago. [[Tokorozawa Shinmei Shrine]] has a traditional establishment of 110 AD. [[Hatogamine Hachiman Shrine]] is believed to date from 921 AD. During the [[Kamakura period]], the [[Kamakura Kaidō]] ran through the area and the area was host to a series of battles fought in May 1333 that were part of the [[Genko War]] that ultimately ended the [[Kamakura Shogunate]]. These include the 1333 [[Battle of Kotesashi (1333)|Battle of Kotesashi]] and the [[Battle of Kumegawa]]. Kotesashi was again the site of another battle nineteen years later. During the [[Edo period]] (1603–1867) the area's major industry was [[sericulture]]. It was also an important trading center, being located at the intersection of roads connecting [[Edo]] with the towns of [[Hachioji]], [[Chichibu, Saitama|Chichibu]], [[Kawagoe, Saitama|Kawagoe]] and [[Fuchu, Tokyo|Fuchu]].

The town of Tokorozawa was created within Iruma District, Saitama with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889.

Tokorozawa became the site of Japan's first air base and air service academy in 1911. The base was used through the end of [[World War II]] and fell under the control of the [[United States Armed Forces]] after the war. The US returned most of its property in Tokorozawa to Japan in 1971, but retains a communications facility in the city which is operated by the [[374th Airlift Wing]] of the [[Fifth Air Force]], based at [[Yokota Air Base]] to the southwest. The facility houses antennas for communications with USAF aircraft in the region. Much of the land returned to Japan has been converted into the public [[Tokorozawa Aviation Memorial Park]].

Tokorozawa was elevated to city status on November 3, 1950. In 1955, Tokorozawa annexed the neighboring villages of Yanase and Mikajima, and assumed its present boundaries. The development of large scale public housing and railroad development led to a rapid population increase in the 1960s. Tokorozawa was the site of the [[Clay pigeon shooting]] event in the 1964 [[1964 Summer Olympics|Tokyo Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1964/SHO/ |title=Archived copy |website=www.sports-reference.com |access-date=13 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200417054113/https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1964/SHO/ |archive-date=17 April 2020 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Tokorozawa was designated as a [[Special cities of Japan|special city]] with increased local autonomy in 2002. It currently meets the conditions to be designated as a [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] but has yet to receive this designation.

==Government==
Tokorozawa has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 34 members. Tokorozawa contributes four members to the Saitama Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Saitama 8th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].
