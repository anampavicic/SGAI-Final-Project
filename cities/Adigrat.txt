'''Adigrat''' ({{Langx|ti|ዓዲግራት}} {{Audio|Adigrat.ogg|pronunciation}}, ''ʿaddigrat'', also called ʿAddi Grat) is a city and separate [[Districts of Ethiopia|woreda]] in [[Tigray Region]] of [[Ethiopia]]. It is located in the [[Misraqawi Zone]] at longitude and latitude {{coord|14|16|N|39|27|E|display=inline,title}}, with an elevation of {{Convert|2457|m|ft}} above sea level and below a high ridge to the west. Adigrat is a strategically important gateway to Eritrea and the [[Red Sea]]. Adigrat was part of [[Ganta Afeshum]] woreda before a separate woreda was created for the city. Currently, Adigrat serves as the capital of the Eastern Tigray zone.

Adigrat is one of the most important cities of Tigray, which evolved from earlier political centers and camps of regional governors. Antalo, Aläqot and Adigrat were a few of them. The decline of Antalo was followed by the rise of Adigrat as another prominent, yet short-lived, capital of Tigray.<ref name=":0">{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Addigrat|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag|location=Wiesbaden|last=Gebrelibanos|first=Tsegay|date=2003|editor-last=Uhlig|editor-first=Siegbert|volume=1}}</ref> It used to serve as the capital of [[Agame]].

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Tradition attributes the origin of the name Adigrat, which means "the country of farmland", to the then popular Tigrayan chief [[Akhadom]]. Adigrat seems to have been under cultivation for a long time. It has a settlement history dating back at least to the 14th century.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=The History of Addigrat, c. 1644-1974|last=Hagos|first=Kebede|publisher=Addis Ababa University|year=1988|location=Addis Ababa}}</ref>

Adigrat appears on indigenous maps of the northern [[Horn of Africa]] in the 15th Century under the name [[Agame]].<ref>Nyssen, J., Tesfaalem Ghebreyohannes, Hailemariam Meaza, Dondeyne, S., 2020.

=== 17th-18th century ===
Adigrat became the center of the Tigrayan chief, ''dejazmach'' Kafle Wahid, the viceroy of atse [[Fasilides]] during the first half of the 17th century.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=A History of Agamä, 1822-1914|last=Berhe|first=Tsegay|publisher=Addis Ababa University|year=1996|location=Addis Ababa}}</ref>

=== 19th Century ===
Adigrat emerged as the political capital of Tigray when ''dejazmach'' [[Sabagadis Woldu]] of Agame assumed the governorship of the region in the period 1822-30. Sabagadis set up some palaces, churches, and markets. This increasingly attracted both natives and foreigners to establish permanent residences and a few shops in the town. Adigrat was an important market center for salt, which was mined in the Afar districts of Areho and Berale in eastern Tigray. However, it declined after the death of its patron, Sabagadis, in 1830. It was repeatedly attacked, sacked, and plundered by the lowlanders and political rivals of Sabagadis.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> [[Samuel Gobat]] had joined countless Ethiopians in fleeing there for safety in the days immediately after Sabagadis' death.<ref name="NAI-website" />

When the missionary [[Johann Ludwig Krapf]] passed through Adigrat in April 1842, "almost the whole is in ruins", and observed that a nearby village, Kersaber, was "much larger than Adigrat."<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/journalsofrevmes00isen/journalsofrevmes00isen_djvu.txt ''Journals of the Rev. Messrs. Isenberg and Krapf, Missionaries of the Church Missionary Society, Detailing their proceedings in the kingdom of Shoa, and journeys in other parts of Abyssinia, in the years 1839, 1840, 1841 and 1842''], (London, 1843), p. 513</ref> In the late 1860s the town had a rural appearance and much of it is still under cultivation today.

During the [[First Italian-Abyssinian War]], the Italians occupied Adigrat on 25 March 1895 and used it as a base to support their advance south to [[Mek'ele]]. General [[Antonio Baldissera]] refortified the settlement after the Italian defeat at the [[Battle of Adowa]], but Emperor [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik II]] insisted on its surrender at the beginning of the peace talks that concluded the war; Baldissera was ordered to evacuate Adigrat, which he did 18 May 1896. [[Augustus B. Wylde]] a few years later described Adigrat as having a Saturday market of medium size.<ref>Augustus B. Wylde, ''Modern Abyssinia'' (London: Methuen, 1901), p. 494</ref>

=== 20th Century ===
Lazarists introduced perhaps the first modern school of northern Ethiopia in Adigrat at the turn of the 20th century. However, like most Ethiopian towns, Adigrat increased its commercial and administrative importance during the period of the Italian occupation. The Italians introduced the first elements of modern infrastructure, including stronger fortresses, restaurants, residential houses, a health center, schools, roads, piped water, an electric generator, etc.<ref name=":0" />

The Italians again occupied Adigrat at the beginning of the [[Second Italian-Abyssinian War]] 7 October 1935. The Italians were met there on the 11th by Ras [[Haile Selassie Gugsa]], who had been courted by the Italians to ignite a widespread defection of the Tigrayan aristocracy; instead, he had been soundly defeated a few days before by [[Dejazmach]] [[Haile Kebbede]] of [[Wag (district)|Wag]], and presented himself to the invaders with only 1200 followers. Anthony Mockler notes that despite the fact the young Ras shook Ethiopian morale, "this was the first and last open defection to the Italians of an important noble and his men."<ref>{{cite book|title=Haile Selassie's War|last=Mockler|first=Anthony|publisher=Olive Branch|year=2003|isbn=1-56656-473-5|location=New York|pages=61ff|orig-year=1984}}</ref>

In 1938, there were shops and hotel-restaurants (“Bologna”, “Piemontese”, “Centrale”). There was also a post, telephone and telegraph office, a health post and a Catholic Apostolic Prefecture.<ref name="guida">{{cite book |last1=Consociazione turistica Italiana |title=Guida dell'Africa orientale Italiana |location=Milano |page=298 |url=http://www.petitesondes.net/Guida-AOI.htm}}</ref>

Adigrat was captured by rebels in the [[Woyane|Woyane rebellion]] 25 September 1943, forcing the Ethiopian government administrators to flee to neighboring Eritrea. By 1958 the city was one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as a First Class Township.<ref name="NAI-website" />

 During the 1970s, Agazi Comprehensive High School, and together with the town's Catholic junior high school, became centers of anti-government dissent.<ref name="PeasantRevolution">{{Cite book|title=Peasant Revolution in Ethiopia|last=Young|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1997|isbn=0521591988|pages=94}}</ref> The presence outside of town of a large military base, served as a focus for protesting students, and also as a source for their hopes of a military coup.[[File:Adigrat, Ethiopia (15571381154).jpg|thumb|Street scene.|left]]Adigrat's dependence on merchandising and trade meant that the Derg's imposition of commercial and transport restrictions was strongly felt and resented.<ref name="PeasantRevolution" /> Under the Derg business licenses became progressively more difficult to get, and traders' trucks were requisitioned for the transport of war-related materials to army bases in Eritrea. Permits of travel were required; convoys were introduced by 1976; and the road links to Asmara were virtually broken, largely by the ELF, by the late 1970s.

During the first years of the [[Ethiopian Civil War]], the fledgling [[Tigrayan People's Liberation Front]] drew support from these groups.<ref name="NAI-website" /> [[Derg]] forces took Adigrat during [[Operation Adwa]] in the summer of 1988. The same day that the [[Third Revolutionary Army]] was crushed at [[Battle of Shire (1989)|Battle of Shire]], 19 February 1989, government troops and officials evacuated Adigrat.<ref>Gebru Tareke, ''The Ethiopian Revolution: War in the Horn of Africa'' (New Haven: Yale University, 2009), p. 284</ref> According to [[Africa Watch]] they caused widespread destruction in the town before they left.<ref name="NAI-website" />

In May 1988, Adigrat was bombed from the air by the [[Ethiopian Air Force]].<ref>Human Rights Watch, 24 July 1991: [https://www.hrw.org/reports/archives/africa/ETHIOPIA907.htm ETHIOPIA - "Mengistu has Decided to Burn Us like Wood" - Bombing of Civilians and Civilian Targets by the Air Force]</ref>

A pharmaceutical factory which became operational in 1997, was set up in the town.

=== 21st Century ===
During the 2020-2021 [[Tigray War]], attacks were carried out on Adigrat by the joint Ethiopian and Eritrean armies, including aerial bombardments.
On 19 December 2020, an [[EEPA]] report stated that 16 civilians were killed while trying to stop Eritrean and ENDF soldiers from robbing the Addis Pharmaceutical Factory.<ref name="EEPA_No31_20Dec2020">{{cite web | title= Situation Report EEPA HORN No. 31 – 20 December | website= [[Europe External Programme with Africa]] |date = 2020-12-20 | url = https://www.eepa.be//wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Situation-Report-EEPA-Horn-No.-31-20-December.docx.pdf | access-date = 2021-01-28 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210112132719/https://www.eepa.be//wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Situation-Report-EEPA-Horn-No.-31-20-December.docx.pdf |archive-date= 2021-01-12 |url-status=live }}</ref>
On 19 December 2020, Catholic Bishop Tesfaselassie Medhin of Adigrat has been reported safe in his residence. The Apostolic Nuntius to Ethiopia, Archbishop [[Antoine Camilleri (prelate)|Antoine Camilleri]], expressed “solidarity with Bishop Medhin who was missing in the assembly because of the situation in his diocese where the war is hard hit.”<ref name="EEPA_No31_20Dec2020"/>

[[File:Adigrat, cattedrale del Salvatore, esterno 03.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of the Holy Saviour, Adigrat|Cathedral of the Holy Saviour]]]]Adigrat, the capital of the [[Agame|Agamé]] district, has a rich aristocratic and political history. In town are the remnants of two castles from the [[Zemene Mesafint]] ("Era of the Princes"), one owned by Dej Desta, the other by the Ras [[Sebhat Aregawi]]. Other sites of interest:
* 19th-century Adigrat Chirkos - was strategically built on a hill near Dej Desta's castle, so that Desta could see the church from his bedroom balcony.
*A few years after World War II land was obtained in the center of Adigrat at a site called "Welwalo".  In view of the possibility that one day it might become a church, the "Holy Saviour" was built and used regularly as a parish church. After the establishment of the Ethiopian Catholic hierarchy in 1961 that church was destined to become the cathedral of the Eparchy of Adigrat. After appropriate modifications were made the formal and official consecration of the Cathedral [[Catholic]] of the Holy Saviour took place on 19 April 1969. It has an Italian design, but incorporates work by Ethiopian artist [[Afewerk Tekle]].<ref name="Carillet">Frances Linzee Gordon, Jean Bernard Carillet ''Ethiopia and Eritrea'' (Lonely Planet, 2003) pp. 168f.</ref>
*Italian War cemetery commemorates some 765 Italian soldiers who died between 1935 and 1938.<ref name="Carillet" />
