== Etymology ==
The city received its contemporary name on 16 March 1919.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/austrian-history-yearbook/article/abs/making-of-a-slovak-city-the-czechoslovak-renaming-of-pressburgpozsonypresporok-191819/950D27008494E5A76C93A8B6BDC739B3|title=The Making of a Slovak City: The Czechoslovak Renaming of Pressburg/Pozsony/Prešporok, 1918–19|publisher=Cambridge University|language=English|date=27 March 2009|doi=10.1017/S0067237800020993 |accessdate=25 March 2023 |last1=Bugge |first1=Peter |journal=Austrian History Yearbook |volume=35 |pages=205–227 |s2cid=145074158 }}</ref> Until then, it was Pozsony, mostly known in English as "Pressburg" (from its German name, {{lang|de|Preßburg}}), since after 1526, it was dominated mostly by the Habsburg monarchy and the city had a relevant ethnic German population. That is the term from which the pre-1919 Slovak ({{lang|sk|Prešporok}}) and Czech ({{lang|cs|Prešpurk}}) names are derived.<ref name="Czechreview"/>

The linguist Ján Stanislav believed the city's Hungarian name, {{lang|hu|Pozsony}}, to be attributed to the surname Božan, likely a prince who owned the castle before 950. Although the Latin name was also based on the same surname, according to research by the lexicologist Milan Majtán, the Hungarian version is not found in any official records from the time in which the prince would have lived. All three versions, however, were related to those found in Slovak, Czech and German: Vratislaburgum (905), Braslavespurch, and Preslavasburc (both 907).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nagayo |first1=Susumu |title=A Reflection on the Names of a City in the Borderlands - Pressburg/Pozsony/Prešporok/Bratislava |url=http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/coe21/publish/no27_ses/Chapter1.pdf |website=Slavic-Eurasian Research Center |publisher=Hokkaido University |access-date=June 16, 2020}}</ref>

The medieval settlement ''[[Battle of Pressburg|Brezalauspurc]]'' (literally, '[[Braslav, Duke of Lower Pannonia|Braslav]]'s castle') is sometimes attributed to Bratislava, but the [[Battle of Pressburg#Location|actual location of Brezalauspurc is under scholarly debate]]. The city's modern name is credited to [[Pavol Jozef Šafárik]]'s misinterpretation of ''Braslav'' as ''Bratislav'' in his analysis of medieval sources, which led him to invent the term ''Břetislaw'', which later became ''Bratislav''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |entry-url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191751394.001.0001/acref-9780191751394-e-995 |entry-url-access=subscription |entry=Bratislava |title=The Concise Dictionary of World Place-Names |edition=3rd |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |isbn=9780191751394}}</ref>

During the revolution of 1918–1919, the name 'Wilsonov' or 'Wilsonstadt' (after US President [[Woodrow Wilson]]) was proposed by American Slovaks, as he supported national self-determination. The name ''Bratislava'', which had been used only by some Slovak patriots, became official in March 1919 with the aim that a Slavic name could support demands for the city to be part of Czechoslovakia.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Duin |first=Pieter C. van |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NswbG0Tso1gC&pg=PR11 |title=Central European Crossroads: Social Democracy and National Revolution in Bratislava (Pressburg), 1867-1921 |date=2009-05-01 |publisher=Berghahn Books |isbn=978-1-84545-918-5 |language=en}}</ref>

Other alternative names of the city in the past include {{langx|el|Ιστρόπολις|Istropolis}} (meaning '[[Hister|Danube]] City', also used in Latin), {{langx|la|Posonium}}, {{langx|ro|Pojon}}, {{langx|hr|Požun}}.

In older documents, confusion can be caused by the Latin forms ''Bratislavia, Wratislavia'' etc., which refer to [[Wrocław]] (Breslau), Poland, not Bratislava. The Polish city has a similar etymology despite spelling differences.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/Graesse/contents.html |last=Grässe |first=J. G.

In the 10th century, the territory of Pressburg (what would later become [[Pozsony County|Pozsony county]]) became part of Hungary (called the "[[Kingdom of Hungary]]" from 1000). It developed as a key economic and administrative centre on the kingdom's frontier.<ref name="middleages">{{cite web|publisher=City of Bratislava |url=http://www.visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&id=1008&p1=1572 |title=History – Bratislava in the Middle Ages |year=2005 |access-date=May 15, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224024106/http://www.visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&id=1008&p1=1572 |archive-date=February 24, 2007}}</ref> In 1052, German Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] undertook a fifth campaign against the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], and besieged Pressburg without success, as the Hungarians sank his supply ships on the [[Danube]] river. This strategic position destined the city to be the site of frequent attacks and battles, but also brought it economic development and high political status. It was granted its first known "town privileges" in 1291 by the Hungarian [[Andrew III of Hungary|King Andrew III]],<ref>Špiesz, "Bratislava v stredoveku", p. 43</ref> and was declared a [[free royal town]] in 1405 by [[King of Hungary|King]] [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]]. In 1436, he authorized the town to use its [[Coat of arms of Bratislava|own coat of arms]].<ref>Špiesz, "Bratislava v stredoveku", p. 132</ref>

The Kingdom of Hungary was defeated by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Battle of Mohács]] in 1526.

=== Bratislava Castle ===
{{Main|Bratislava Castle}}
[[File:Bratislava - Burg (c).JPG|thumb|Bratislava Castle]]

One of the most prominent structures in the city is [[Bratislava Castle]] (''Bratislavský hrad''), situated on a plateau {{convert|85|m|ft|0}} above the Danube. The castle hill site has been inhabited since the transitional period between the [[Stone Age|Stone]] and [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] ages<ref>Lacika, "Bratislava", pp. 11–12</ref> and has been the [[acropolis]] of a [[Celts|Celtic]] town, part of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]] Romanus, a huge Slavic fortified settlement, and a political, military and religious centre for [[Great Moravia]].<ref>Lacika, "Bratislava", p. 121</ref> A stone [[castle]] was not constructed until the 10th century, when the area was part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], however, in the [[9th century]] a [[Great Moravian Basilica in Bratislava|pre-romanesque stone basilica]], was standing in the area of the hillfort.

The castle was converted into a [[International Gothic|Gothic]] anti-[[Hussite]] fortress under [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxemburg]] in 1430, became a [[Renaissance]] castle in 1562,<ref>Lacika, "Bratislava", p. 124</ref> and was rebuilt in 1649 in the [[baroque]] style. Under [[Queen regnant|Queen]] [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], the castle became a prestigious royal seat. In 1811, the castle was inadvertently destroyed by fire and lay in ruins until the 1950s,<ref>Lacika, "Bratislava", p. 128</ref> when it was rebuilt mostly in its former Theresian style. In the 1940s, it was planned to demolish the castle ruins and replace them with a new university complex. However, it was never realised, and in the 1960s, reconstruction began. Nowadays, it serves ceremonial purposes and as a historical museum of the [[Slovak National Museum]].

=== City Council ===
The Bratislava City Council is the legislature of the City of Bratislava. It has 45 members. The Council usually convenes once a month and consists of 45 members elected to four-year terms concurrent with the mayor's. Many of the council's executive functions are carried out by the city commission at the council's direction.<ref name="citycommission"/> The city board is a 28-member body composed of the mayor and his deputies, the borough mayors, and up to ten city council members. The board is an executive and supervisory arm of the city council and also serves in an advisory role to the mayor.<ref name="cityboard"/>

=== Administration ===
Administratively, Bratislava is divided into five [[Districts of Slovakia|districts]]: Bratislava I (the city centre), Bratislava II (eastern parts), Bratislava III (north-eastern parts), Bratislava IV (western and northern parts) and Bratislava V (southern parts on the right bank of the Danube, including Petržalka, the most densely populated residential area in [[Central Europe]]).<ref name="petrzalkacity">{{cite web|publisher=City of Bratislava |url=http://visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&id=1074&p1=1852 |title=Petržalka City |date=March 1, 2007 |access-date=January 29, 2008 |quote=Petržalka City will transform the largest and most densely populated housing estate in Central Europe from a monotone cement-panel housing scheme into a fully-fledged town with autonomous multipurpose centre. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012191006/http://visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&id=1074&p1=1852 |archive-date=October 12, 2007}}</ref>

For self-governance purposes, the city is divided into 17 boroughs, each of which has its own mayor (''starosta'') and council. The number of councillors in each depends on the size and population of the borough.<ref name="localgovernment">{{cite web|title=Local Government |url=http://visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&id=1044&p1=1811 |year=2005 |access-date=April 29, 2007 |publisher=City of Bratislava |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305050254/http://visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&id=1044&p1=1811 |archive-date=March 5, 2007}}</ref> Each of the boroughs coincides with the city's 20 [[Cadastre|cadastral areas]], except for two cases: Nové Mesto is further divided into the Nové Mesto and Vinohrady cadastral areas and Ružinov is divided into Ružinov, Nivy and Trnávka. Further unofficial division recognizes additional quarters and localities.

Public transport in Bratislava is managed by [[Dopravný podnik Bratislava]], a city-owned company. The transport system is known as ''Mestská hromadná doprava'' (MHD, Municipal Mass Transit) and employs buses, [[tram]]s, and [[trolleybus]]es.<ref name="publictransportroutes">{{cite web|publisher=[[Dopravný podnik Bratislava]] |url=http://www.dpb.sk/trasy/trasy.htm |title=Trasy liniek (routes) |year=2007 |access-date=May 17, 2007 |language=sk |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506025027/http://www.dpb.sk/trasy/trasy.htm#Vlaky |archive-date=May 6, 2007}}</ref> Most of the Bratislava public transport is coated in a typical color combination of red and black.

Bratislava is also part of an integrated system, ''IDS BK,'' connecting city public transport with other transport companies in the Bratislava region. Traveling with a single ticket is possible throughout the system network, both in Bratislava and to the nearby villages and cities, including three other districts of Senec, Malacky, and Pezinok.

As a rail hub, the city has direct connections to [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Poland]], [[Germany]], [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]] and the rest of Slovakia. [[Bratislava-Petržalka railway station]] and [[Bratislava main railway station|Bratislava Main station]] are the principal railway stations.

Daily trains and buses from Bratislava to Vienna run multiple times every hour, with the [[Wien Hauptbahnhof|Wien Hbf]] train station serving Bratislava as well, with more connections throughout Europe, opening possibilities for a travel to [[Italy]] and [[France]] with a quick change of trains in Vienna.

The main bus station (''Autobusová stanica'' or ''Autobusová stanica Nivy'') is located at Mlynské Nivy, east of the city centre, and offers both bus connections to cities in Slovakia and international bus lines. A new bus station attached to a shopping mall, administration centre, and Bratislava's tallest skyscraper, Nivy Tower, was opened on the 30th of September 2021.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/22753588/new-bus-station-opened-to-public-together-with-roundabout-and-bike-tower.html | title=New bus station opened to public, together with roundabout and bike tower | date=September 30, 2021 }}</ref> The bus station lies underground and its design was inspired by airport terminals. The waiting area offers enough space and comfort to wait for the bus.

The motorway system provides direct access to [[Brno]] in the Czech Republic, [[Vienna]] in Austria, [[Budapest]] in Hungary, [[Trnava]], and other points in Slovakia. The [[Nordostautobahn|A6 motorway]] between Bratislava and [[Vienna]] was opened in November 2007.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vienna-Bratislava in 50 Minutes (''Wien – Bratislava in 50 Minuten'') |language=de |publisher=[[Österreichischer Rundfunk|ORF]] |date=October 19, 2007 |url=http://burgenland.orf.at/stories/229622/ |access-date=2007-10-19 |archive-date=July 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706093610/http://burgenland.orf.at/stories/229622/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The [[Port of Bratislava]] is one of the two international [[port|river ports]] in Slovakia. The port provides access to the [[Black Sea]] via the Danube and to the [[North Sea]] through the [[Rhine–Main–Danube Canal]]. Additionally, tourist lines operate from Bratislava's passenger port, including routes to [[Devín]], [[Vienna]], and elsewhere. In Bratislava there are currently six bridges standing over the [[Danube]] (ordered by the flow of the river): [[Lafranconi Bridge|Most Lafranconi]] (Lafranconi Bridge), [[Most Slovenského národného povstania|Most SNP]] (Bridge of the Slovak National Uprising, previously called ''Nový most'' or ''New bridge'') with the famous [[UFO Tower]], [[Starý most (Bratislava)|Starý most]] (The Old Bridge), [[Apollo Bridge|Most Apollo]] (Apollo Bridge), [[Prístavný most]] (The Harbor Bridge) and Lužný most (The Floodplain bridge).

Bratislava's [[Bratislava Airport|M.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Štefánik Airport]] is the main [[international airport]] in Slovakia. The airport is located {{convert|9|km|mi|1}} north-east of the city centre, with fast connections served by the city public transport. It serves civil and governmental, scheduled and unscheduled domestic and international flights. The current runways support the landing for all common types of aircraft. It served 2,024,000 passengers in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=TASR, published in Bratislavské Noviny |url=http://www.bratislavskenoviny.sk/73806/cestovny-ruch/letisko-vybavilo-vlani-viac-ako-2-miliony-pasazierov |title=Airport served more than 2 million passengers last year (''Letisko vybavilo vlani viac ako 2 milióny pasažierov'') |language=sk |date=January 13, 2008 |access-date=January 13, 2008}}</ref> Bratislava is also served by the [[Vienna International Airport]] located {{convert|49|km|mi|1}} west of the city centre. It is common for Bratislava residents to use the Vienna airport often, as it offers more variety and can be reached under 60 minutes from Bratislava with a car.
