[[File:Garanhuns-pórtico.jpg|thumb|Portico]]'''Garanhuns''' is a city in the [[Brazil]]ian state of [[Pernambuco]]. Located in the [[Borborema Plateau]], the town is known as the "Suíça Pernambucana" (Pernambucan [[Switzerland]]) due to its elevation and relatively cool climate. It is also known as "Cidade das Flores" ("City of Flowers") or "Cidade da Garoa" ("City of Drizzle").

Garanhuns is most famous for the '''Festival de Inverno''', or The Winter Festival, which it holds every year in July. During the winter, temperatures in Garanhuns can drop to {{convert|7|C|F}}. This is quite cold for a city that is only a few degrees south of the equator.

Garañun (Garanhun) was an extinct, undocumented language once spoken by an indigenous tribe in the Serra dos Garanhuns.<ref name="Loukotka">{{cite book |last=Loukotka |first=Čestmír |author-link=Čestmír Loukotka |title=Classification of South American Indian languages |url=https://archive.org/details/classificationof0007louk |url-access=registration |publisher=UCLA Latin American Center |year=1968 |location=Los Angeles}}</ref>
