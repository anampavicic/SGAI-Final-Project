'''Fullerton''' ({{IPAc-en|'|f|ʊ|l|ər|t|ən}} {{respell|FUUL|ər|tən}}) is a city located in northern [[Orange County, California]], United States. As of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], the city had a total population of 143,617.<ref name=quif />

Fullerton was founded in 1887. It secured the land on behalf of the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]]. Historically it was a center of [[agriculture]], notably groves of Valencia [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s and other [[citrus]] crops; [[petroleum]] extraction; transportation; and manufacturing. It is home to numerous higher educational institutions, particularly [[California State University, Fullerton]] and [[Fullerton College]]. From the mid-1940s through the late 1990s, Fullerton was home to a large industrial base made up of [[aerospace]] contractors, canneries, paper products manufacturers, and is considered to be the birthplace of the [[electric guitar]], due in large part to [[Leo Fender]]. The headquarters of [[Vons]], which is owned by [[Albertsons]], is located in Fullerton near the Fullerton–[[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]] line.

==History==
===Indigenous===
Evidence of prehistoric animal habitation, such as [[saber-toothed cats]] and [[mammoths]], is present in [[Ralph B. Clark Regional Park]] in the northwest of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.fullerton.ca.us/depts/city_manager/history_of_fullerton/default.asp |title=City of Fullerton Official Website |publisher=Ci.fullerton.ca.us |access-date=November 26, 2011}}</ref>

The area of the city was a part of the homelands of the [[Tongva]] for thousands of years.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fullerton {{!}} California, United States {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Fullerton |access-date=January 5, 2023 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> There was a large village in the area along the [[Santa Ana River]] that has since been identified as the [[Hutuknga]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Welch |first=Rosanne |date=2006 |title=A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE TONGVA TRIBE |url=https://habitatauthority.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/native_american_history.pdf |website=Habitat Authority}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2010 |title=Cultural and Paleontological Resources |url=https://www.banningranchconservancy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Appendix-J-Part-1-Cultural-and-Paleontological-Resources.pdf |website=Banning Ranch Conservancy}}</ref> The village was one of the largest throughout all of [[Tovaangar]], or the Tongva world.

===Spanish era===

===American era===
In 1894, [[Charles Chapman (mayor)|Charles Chapman]] purchased an orange orchard in eastern Fullerton. The Valencia variety of oranges he promoted from his Santa Ysabel Ranch, well suited to the local climate, proved a boon to producers; Fullerton boasted more orange groves than any other municipality in the [[United States]]. Cultivation of [[walnut]]s and [[avocado]]s also flourished, and the Western railroad town became an agricultural center. Fullerton was incorporated in 1904,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fullerton, CA |url=https://www.trustandprobatelawyers.com/fullerton-ca.html|access-date=October 13, 2021|website=Orange County Trust Lawyer Crockett Law Corporation }}</ref>

===Boom years===

Drilling for [[petroleum]] began in 1880 with the discovery of the [[Brea-Olinda Oil Field]] and fueled the first real boom, peaking in the 1920s. Construction reflected the vogue for Spanish Colonial and [[Architectural history#Italian Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance–inspired]] architecture, as in the historic [[Fox Theatre (Fullerton)|Fox Fullerton Theatre]] (erected 1925); the [[Muckenthaler House]], designed by Frank K. Benchley (erected 1924); and the city's chief landmark, the Plummer Auditorium and clock tower (erected 1930). [[Fullerton College]] was established at its present location at Chapman Avenue and Lemon Street in 1913. Meanwhile, the city banned all overnight street parking in 1924 – a law enforced to the present day, unless an area is specifically exempted.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cityoffullerton.com/resident/neighborhood/overnight_parking.asp|title=Overnight Parking|publisher=City of Fullerton |access-date=December 10, 2018 |archive-date=December 10, 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181210202655/https://www.cityoffullerton.com/resident/neighborhood/overnight_parking.asp}}</ref>

In 1943, the Alex Bernal residence became the site of one of the first successful lawsuits against household [[Covenant (law)|covenant laws]] in the country after Alex and Esther Bernal purchased a home in a Fullerton neighborhood that barred purchases from "Mexicans." After a [[home invasion]] that resulted in their belongings being thrown into the street and a petition signed by fifty neighborhood residents to have the Bernal's removed from the neighborhood, a lawsuit was issued against the Bernals on the basis that their presence caused "irreparable injury" to the neighborhood that could lead to "coming in contact with said other races, including Mexicans, in a social and neighborhood manner." Lawyer David C. Marcus represented the Bernals in ''Doss vs. Bernal'' and won the case, which received national attention.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Lewinnek |first1=Elaine |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1226813397 |title=A people's guide to Orange County |date=2022 |first2=Gustavo |last2=Arellano |first3=Thuy |last3=Vo Dang |isbn=978-0-520-97155-4 |location=Oakland, California |pages=77–78 |oclc=1226813397 |publisher=University of California Press }}</ref>

In 1949, [[Leo Fender]] developed and refined the world's first commercially successful solid-body electric guitar, the [[Fender Telecaster]].

===Postwar suburbanization===
[[File:Val Vita Foods workers Fullerton, California 1940.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|[[Val Vita Food Products]] workers, 1940]]
Although Fullerton, like other Southern California cities, had experienced an expansion of population due to housing development, this increased by an order of magnitude during the post war years. Fullerton's population soared after [[World War II]] as American veterans migrated to [[California]], bought housing in the land development which destroyed the surrounding farming and park areas, and in particular after the construction of [[Interstate 5 (California)|Interstate 5]] and development in neighboring [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]].

To serve the growing population, the [[California State Legislature]] authorized [[California State University, Fullerton|Orange County State College]] in 1957, which began operating out of Fullerton high schools in 1959. In 1963, it moved to its present campus on State College Boulevard, and later, after several name-changes, was finally redesignated [[California State University, Fullerton]]. The Fullerton Arboretum, a 26-acre (105,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) [[botanical garden]], opened in 1979.<ref>"[https://fullertonarboretum.org/history.aspx History]", Fullerton Arboretum.</ref>

Manufacturing growth leveled off as ever-soaring property prices, increasing environmental regulation, traffic, and other pressures increased. By the late 20th century the city had lost much of its rural character in favor of [[suburb]]an housing tracts and shopping centers.

===Recent history===
In the 1990s, the downtown commercial district had become economically depressed, and was known mainly for being an area of sleepy antique stores and small shops. A symbol of downtown's problems was the [[Fox Theatre (Fullerton, California)|Fox Theatre]], a local landmark, which had fallen into disrepair. As of November 2004, a fundraising drive had accumulated sufficient funds to buy the theater, but not yet enough money to restore it. By 2006, restoration was started.

During this same period, downtown Fullerton (DTF), especially in the south of Commonwealth area (SOCO),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.fullerton.ca.us/visitors/downtown_fullerton/soco_district.asp |title=SOCO District |publisher=City of Fullerton |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716121156/http://www.ci.fullerton.ca.us/visitors/downtown_fullerton/soco_district.asp |archive-date=July 16, 2014 |access-date=May 20, 2014}}</ref> has become more of a busy entertainment district, described by the ''[[OC Weekly]]'' as "[[Bourbon Street]] West." In less than five years, some 30 businesses that sell alcohol have opened, making the downtown area much more active at night. In 2008, City Manager Chris Meyer called together department head and the finance department and reported to the city council that the Restaurant Overlay District (established December 2002) was costing the city $935,000 over and above the sales taxes collected.

The {{convert|293|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Hughes Aircraft|Hughes Aircraft Company]]'s Ground Systems Group campus in western Fullerton was redeveloped into a new residential and commercial district called ''Amerige Heights,'' in between 2001 and 2004.<ref>"[http://amerigeheights.org/177-2/ History]", Amerige Heights.</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Cliffs in Coyote Hills, Fullerton, CA, seen from Ralph B. Clark Park.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Cliffs in the [[West Coyote Hills]]]]
[[File:Dr George Clark House.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fullerton Arboretum]]]]
Fullerton is located at {{Coord|33|52|48|N|117|55|43|W|type:city}} (33.879914, -117.928749).<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is approximately {{convert|25|mi|km}} southeast of downtown [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and approximately {{convert|11|mi|km}} north-northwest of [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]], the [[county seat]]. The city has a mean elevation of {{Convert|150|ft|m}} and lies approximately {{convert|11|mi|km}} northeast of the [[Pacific Ocean]] straight-line distance. It has a [[Mediterranean]] climate, with a mean temperature of {{Convert|62.2|F|C}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|22.4|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|22.4|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.01|sqmi|km2}}, comprising 0.05%, is water.

It is bordered by [[La Habra]] and [[Brea, California|Brea]] on the north, [[La Mirada]] on the northwest, [[Buena Park]] on the west, [[Anaheim]] on the south, and [[Placentia, California|Placentia]] on the east.

The flat downtown area is laid out in a [[grid plan]] centered at the intersection of Harbor Boulevard and Commonwealth Avenue. After recent renewal and beautification projects, it has attracted specialty stores, coffee shops, and restaurants, and has uncharacteristically retained much of its [[downtown]] character. Southeastern Fullerton is historically the industrial sector, and is home to small manufacturing, particularly east of Raymond Street and south of Commonwealth.

The northern and western reaches of Fullerton are dominated by the Coyote Hills, a low-lying mountain range divided into the [[East Coyote Hills]] and [[West Coyote Hills]]. The land south of West Coyote Hills is known as Sunny Hills. For most of the city's history these areas were groves of citrus trees, open [[scrubland]], and oil fields. While [[equestrianism|equestrian]] trails and many old estates endure along Bastanchury Road, the meandering roads through these areas today mostly connect a succession of housing tract subdivisions and commercial developments. In recent years, the city council has tried to allow development in the remaining open land throughout the city. The most notable impending project, in West Coyote Hills, has been met with opposition by many of the citizens in the area.

===Development of West Coyote Hills===
[[File:Coyote-Hills-Fullerton.jpg|thumb|The [[West Coyote Hills]] are one of the last open spaces in northern [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}]] 
[[West Coyote Hills]] is a ridge lying mostly in northern Fullerton, including {{convert|510|acres|0|abbr=on}} owned by Pacific Coast Homes (a land development division of the [[Chevron Corporation]]) that are the largest remaining tract of undeveloped land in north Orange County. The current development agreement calls for building houses on some of the land while donating the remainder to the city as a nature preserve. A group that supports keeping the entire area as open space/nature preserve qualified a referendum for a November 2012 election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/hills-322749-coyote-city.html |title=Fullerton voters to decide on 760-home project |publisher=Ocregister.com |access-date=May 20, 2014}}</ref> In the election, voters approved Measure W, which would prevent development in the area.<ref>"Fullerton's Open Space Battle Still Ongoing," Voice of OC, March 31, 2016, https://voiceofoc.org/2016/03/fullertons-open-space-battle-still-ongoing/</ref> Ongoing lawsuits between the City of Fullerton (pro-development) and local conservationists (anti-development) have resulted over the interpretation of the measure. In February 2019, the California State Supreme Court denied a petition to review a lower court pro-development decision against Measure W. The City of Fullerton and The Friends of Coyote Hills are currently in competing negotiations with Chevron over either purchasing the land for development or donating the land for conservation with Chevron receiving tax credits and conservation funds in exchange for the donation.<ref>"Supreme Court Will Not Hear Measure W Lawsuit" http://www.coyotehills.org/about-west-coyote-hills/current-status/</ref>

===Climate===
According to the [[Köppen Climate Classification]] system, Fullerton has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]], abbreviated ''Csa'' on climate maps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=582340&cityname=Fullerton%2C+California%2C+United+States+of+America&units= |title=Fullerton, California Köppen Climate Classification |publisher=Weatherbase |access-date=May 20, 2014}}</ref>

==Media==
From 1921 to 1984, Fullerton had the largest independent daily newspaper in Orange County, The [[Fullerton Daily News Tribune]]. The Fullerton Daily News Tribune circulated 6 days a week, Monday through Saturday, in all of Fullerton, Brea, Placentia, La Habra, Buena Park, Yorba Linda, and a northern section of Anaheim. At one point in the 1970s The Fullerton News Tribune reached a peak circulation of 30,000 daily subscribers. Formerly owned, for 30 years, by former Scripps newspaper executive Edgar F. Elfstrom, The Fullerton News Tribune was bought by [[Scripps Howard]] Newspapers in 1975. In 1984 the [[Orange County Register]] bought the Fullerton News Tribune and converted the daily newspaper to a once-weekly free distribution newspaper.

Fullerton is also one of the few Southern California municipalities to be served by an independent newspaper, the [[Fullerton Observer]]. The ''Fullerton Observer Community Newspaper'' is an all-volunteer 40-year-old paper that is printed twice a month. It was founded in the late 1970s by Ralph Kennedy, a fair housing and civil rights activist who advocated saving Coyote Hills as an open space. In 2010, the city of Fullerton and the ''[[Orange County Register]]'' came out in court against the then 32-year-old ''Fullerton Observer'' in its request to adjudicate the paper. In response to the city of Fullerton and the Orange County Register's high-powered lawyers coming out against the newspaper, the not-for-profit Fullerton Observer dropped its court case to be adjudicated a newspaper.{{Citation needed|reason=This statement needs a reliable source |date=November 2019}}
