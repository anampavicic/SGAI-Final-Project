Gainesville's tree canopy is both dense and species rich, including broadleaf evergreens, conifers, and deciduous species; the city has been recognized by the [[National Arbor Day Foundation]] every year since 1982 as a "Tree City, USA". A 2016 ecological assessment indicates Gainesville's urban tree canopy covers 47 percent of its land area.<ref>{{cite report |last1=Andreu|first1=Michael G.|last2=Fox|first2=David A.|last3=Landry|first3=Shawn M.|last4=Northrop|first4=Robert J.|last5=Hament|first5=Caroline A.|date=2017-03-01 |title=City of Gainesville Urban Forest Ecological Analysis 2016 |url=http://sfrc.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/GNV-ECO-Report-2016.pdf |page=16 |access-date=2019-06-22 |quote="Based on Eco sample plot data collected, the estimated average tree canopy cover of Gainesville is 47%"}}</ref>

The city is characterized by its medium size and central location, about two hours' driving time from either [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] or [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], three hours from [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], and six hours from either [[Atlanta]] or [[Miami]].

===Climate===
Gainesville's climate is defined as [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa''), with tropical-like summers, warm to hot shoulder seasons, and mild winters. Due to its inland location, Gainesville experiences wide temperature fluctuations, and it is part of USDA Plant [[hardiness zone]] 9a.<ref>{{cite web|title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map|url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|access-date=2018-03-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227032333/http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/|archive-date=February 27, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> During the hot season, from roughly May 15 to September 30, the city's climate is similar to the rest of the state, with frequent afternoon thunderstorms and high humidity. Average temperatures range from the low 70s (21–23&nbsp;°C) at night to around {{convert|91|°F|0}} during the day.

In the cool season, Gainesville experiences 15 nights of temperatures at freezing or below and sustained freezes every few years. The all-time record low of {{cvt|6|°F|0}} was reached on [[Great Blizzard of 1899|February 13, 1899]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jax/gnv_records_February.shtml |title=Gainesville Records for February |publisher=[[National Weather Service]] |access-date=2007-07-21}}</ref> and the city experienced light snow and freezing rain on Christmas Eve, 1989.

Temperatures reaching {{convert|100|°F|0}} or falling below {{convert|20|°F|0}} are rare, having respectively last occurred on June 4, 2019, and January 11, 2010.

The city's flora and fauna are also distinct from coastal regions of the state, and include many deciduous species, such as [[dogwood]], maple, hickory and [[sweet gum]], alongside palms, [[live oak]]s, and other evergreens. This allows the city to enjoy brief periods of fall color in late November and December and a noticeable, prolonged spring from mid-February through early April. This is a generally pleasant period, as colorful blooms of [[azalea]] and [[redbud]] complement a cloudless blue sky, for this is also the period of the lowest precipitation and lowest humidity. The city averages {{convert|48.31|in|sigfig=3}} of rain per year. June through September accounts for most annual rainfall, while autumn and early winter is the driest period.

Since the 1990s, suburban sprawl has been a concern for a majority of the city commissioners. The "New Urbanization" plan to gentrify the area between historic Downtown and the University of Florida may slow the growth of suburban sectors and spark a migration toward upper-level apartments in the inner city. The area immediately north of the university is also seeing active redevelopment. Many gentrification plans rely on tax incentives that have sparked controversy<ref name=Alligator_2007-12-05>{{cite web|url=http://www.alligator.org/opinion/letters_to_the_editor/article_beac9169-4faf-5979-b991-439ad4b073ee.html|title=City shouldn't pay for University Corners|author=Randy Jewett|website=Alligator.org|access-date=October 17, 2017}}</ref> and are sometimes unsuccessful.

Gainesville's east side houses the majority of the city's African-American community, while the west side consists of the mainly student and White resident communities. West of the city limits are large-scale planned communities, most notably [[Haile Plantation, Florida|Haile Plantation]], which was built on the site of its eponymous former plantation.

The destruction of the city's landmark [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] courthouse in the 1960s, which some considered unnecessary, brought the idea of historic preservation to the community's attention. The bland county building that replaced the grand courthouse became known to some locals as the "air conditioner". Additional destruction of the downtown area's historic buildings has left a small handful of older buildings, like the [[Hippodrome State Theatre]], at one time a federal building. However, revitalization of the city's core has picked up, and the city is replacing many parking lots and underutilized buildings with infill development and near-campus housing that blend with existing historic structures. There is a proposal to rebuild a replica of the old courthouse on a parking lot one block from the original location.

Helping in this effort are the number of areas and buildings added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Dozens of examples of restored Victorian and [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne style]] residences constructed in the city's agricultural heyday of the 1880s and 1890s can be found in the following districts:
* [[Northeast Gainesville Residential District]]
* [[Southeast Gainesville Residential District]]
* [[Pleasant Street Historic District (Gainesville, Florida)|Pleasant Street Historic District]]

Additionally, the [[University of Florida Campus Historic District]], consisting of 11 buildings and 14 contributing properties, lies within the city's boundaries. Most of the buildings in the Campus Historic District are constructed in variations of [[Collegiate Gothic]] architecture, which returned to prominence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Historic structures on the Register in and around downtown are:
* [[Bailey House (Gainesville, Florida)|Bailey Plantation House]] (1854)
* [[Colson House#Colson House (Gainesville, Florida)|Colson House]] (1905)
* [[Matheson House (Gainesville, Florida)|Matheson House]] (1867)
* [[Hotel Thomas|Thomas Hotel]] (1910)
* The [[U.S. Post Office (Gainesville, Florida)|Old Post Office]] (now the [[Hippodrome State Theatre]]) (1911)
* [[Masonic Order Lodge No. 41 (Gainesville, Florida)|Masonic Temple]] (1908)
* [[Dixie Hotel (Gainesville, Florida)|Seagle Building]] (1926), downtown Gainesville's tallest building.
* [[Baird Hardware Company Warehouse]] (1890)
* [[Cox Furniture Store]] (1875)
* [[Cox Furniture Warehouse]] (c. 1890)
* [[Epworth Hall (Gainesville, Florida)|Epworth Hall]] (1884)

==Economy==
Numerous guides, such as the 2004 ''Cities Ranked and Rated: More than 400 Metropolitan Areas Evaluated in the U.S. and Canada'', have mentioned Gainesville's low cost of living. The restaurants near the [[University of Florida]] also tend to be inexpensive. The property taxes are high to offset the cost of the university, as the university's land is tax-exempt, but the median home cost is slightly below the national average, and Gainesville residents, like all Floridians, do not pay state income taxes.

The city's job market scored only 6 out of a possible 100 points in the ''Cities Ranked and Rated'' guide, as the downside to the low cost of living is an extremely weak local job market that is oversupplied with college-educated residents. Gainesville's [[Median household income|median income]] is slightly below the U.S. average.

Gainesville heavily promoted [[solar power]] by creating the first [[feed-in tariff]] (FIT) in the United States. The FIT allowed small businesses and homeowners to supply electricity into the municipal [[Electrical grid|power grid]] and paid a premium for the clean, on-site generated solar electricity. The FIT started with a rate of $0.32 per [[kilowatt-hour]] and allowed a person or business to enter into a 20-year contract where Gainesville Regional Utilities would purchase the power for 20 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/03/gainesville-florida-solar-power-feed-in-tariff-program-maxed-ou.php|title=Gainesville, Florida Solar Power Feed-In Tariff Program Maxed Out Before It Begins|website=Treehugger.com|access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref> The FIT ended in 2013,<ref>{{cite web|last=Curry |first=Christopher |url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20131219/ARTICLES/131219531 |title=City Commission will not add to feed-in tariff in 2014 |publisher=Gainesville.com |date=2013-12-19 |access-date=2015-06-07}}</ref> when the rate was set at $0.18 per kWh, but the city is still seen as a leader in solar power. This increase in solar installations put Gainesville at number 5 in the world in solar installed per capita, beating Japan, France, China and all of the US.<ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Farrell |url= http://cleantechnica.com/2012/01/06/gainesville-florida-becomes-a-world-leader-in-solar/ |title=Gainesville, Florida, Becomes a World Leader in Solar |website=[[CleanTechnica]] |date=2012-01-06 |access-date=2015-06-07}}</ref>

The sports drink [[Gatorade]] was invented in Gainesville in the 1960s to help refresh the UF football team.

Gainesville's reputation as an independent music mecca can be traced back to 1984 when a local music video station was brought on the air. The station was called TV-69, broadcast on UHF 69 and was owned by Cozzin Communications.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.afn.org/~riffer/projects/hogtown/TV69.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 21, 2008 |archive-date=June 30, 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120630221742/http://www.afn.org/~riffer/projects/hogtown/TV69.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> The channel drew considerable media attention thanks to its promotion by [[Bill Cosby]], who was part owner of the station when it started. TV-69 featured many videos by punk and indie-label bands and had several locally produced videos ("Clone Love" by a local parody band, and a [[Dinosaur Jr.]] song).
