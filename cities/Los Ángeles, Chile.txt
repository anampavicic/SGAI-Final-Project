'''Los Ángeles''' ({{IPA|es|los ˈaŋxeles}}) is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Bío Bío Province|province of Bío Bío]], in the [[Communes of Chile|commune]] of the same name, in [[Bío Bío Region|Bío Bío]], in the center-south of [[Chile]]. It is located between the [[Laja River (Chile)|Laja]] and [[Biobío river]]s. The population is 186,671 inhabitants ([[census]] 2012). The municipality ("comuna") of Los Ángeles has the highest absolute rural population of any Chilean municipality.

To the north of the city is Salto del Laja ([[Laja Falls]]), and roughly 100 kilometers to the east is the {{convert|2,979|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} high [[Antuco (volcano)|Antuco]] volcano, in the [[Andes]] mountain range. The city is a gateway for tourists visiting the nearby [[Laguna del Laja National Park]], the location of the volcano.

Los Ángeles is served by [[María Dolores Airport]].

==History==
Founded as Nuestra Señora de Los Ángeles (Our Lady of the Angels) in 1739 by [[José Antonio Manso de Velasco]], it was originally a [[Spain|Spanish]] fort as an outpost in the [[War of Arauco]]. It received the title of ''villa'' in 1748. The city underwent numerous rebuildings, due to the Spanish military campaigns against the native [[Mapuche]] in their efforts to colonize the area. Its geographic location, just to the north of the Biobío river (the border established by the Spaniards), made it a strategic location.

In 1858, during the process of [[german colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|German immigration in Chile]], Colonia Humán was founded, a town colonized by German settlers from Germany and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and which was completely conurbated within the current urban limits of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://baierdechile.cl/human.html|title=Colonia alemana en Los Angeles: Colonia Human|website=baierdechile.cl}}</ref>

==Demographics==
According to the 2002 [[census]] of the [[National Statistics Institute (Chile)|National Statistics Institute]], Los Ángeles spans an area of {{convert|1748.2|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} and has 166,556 inhabitants (81,863 men and 84,693 women). Of these, 123,445 (74.1%) lived in [[urban area]]s and 43,111 (25.9%) in [[rural area]]s. The population grew by 18.5% (26,021 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.<ref name= "INE"/>

Within the communities of historical immigrants of the city of foreign origin, the [[spanish Chileans|Spanish]], [[arab Chileans|Arabs]], [[German Chileans|Germans]], and [[Swiss Chileans|Swiss]] stand out, depending on their number and contributions, from the colonized localities by Europeans in the area, especially from Araucanía.

== Climate ==
This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6&nbsp;°F. According to the [[Köppen Climate Classification]] system, Los Ángeles has a [[Mediterranean climate#Warm-summer Mediterranean climate|warm-summer Mediterranean climate]], abbreviated "Csb" on climate maps. Most of the annual precipitation of 42 inches (1070&nbsp;mm) falls during the autumn and winter months of April through September. May is the wettest month, with 10 inches (250&nbsp;mm) of precipitation on average. Snow is uncommon, and when it falls melts quickly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=30758&cityname=Los+Angeles,+Biobio,+Chile&units=|title=Los Angeles, Chile Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase}}</ref>

==Administration==
As a commune, Los Ángeles is a third-level [[administrative division of Chile]] administered by a [[municipal council]], headed by an [[alcalde]] who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde is Joel Rosales Guzmán ([[Independent Democratic Union|UDI]]).<ref name="Munitel"/><ref name="Official"/>

Within the [[electoral divisions of Chile]], Los Ángeles is represented in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]] by Juan Lobos (UDI) and José Pérez ([[Social Democrat Radical Party|PRSD]]) as part of the 47th electoral district, together with [[Tucapel]], [[Antuco, Chile|Antuco]], [[Quilleco]], [[Santa Bárbara, Chile|Santa Bárbara]], [[Quilaco]], [[Mulchén]], [[Negrete]], [[Nacimiento, Chile|Nacimiento]], [[San Rosendo]], [[Laja, Chile|Laja]] and [[Alto Bío Bío]]. The commune is represented in the [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] by Victor Pérez Varela (UDI) and Mariano Ruiz-Esquide Jara ([[Christian Democratic Party|PDC]]) as part of the 13th senatorial constituency (Biobío-Coast).

==Popular culture==
The author [[Roberto Bolaño]] spent much of his childhood here.<ref>Echevarría, ed., 2004, op. cit. «Recuerdos de Los Ángeles», pp. 204-205. [Published originally between September, 2002 and January, 2003 in the column ''Entre Paréntesis'' of [[Las Últimas Noticias]].]</ref>

The 90s alternative music artist [[Frank Black]] wrote a song about a place in "South Patagonia" called Los Angeles on the first track of his eponymous album; while the Chilean Los Angeles lies just north of the northernmost part of Patagonia (demarcated as south of the [[Huincul Fault]] according to geographical definitions), it is probable that Black is referring to the Chilean Los Angeles.
