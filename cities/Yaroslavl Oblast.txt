'''Yaroslavl Oblast'''{{efn|{{lang-rus|Ярославская область|r=Jaroslavskaja oblastj|p=jɪrɐˈsɫafskəjə ˈobɫəsʲtʲ}}}} is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (an [[oblast]]), which is located in the [[Central Federal District]], surrounded by the [[Tver Oblast|Tver]], [[Moscow Oblast|Moscow]], [[Ivanovo Oblast|Ivanovo]], [[Vladimir Oblast|Vladimir]], [[Kostroma Oblast|Kostroma]], and [[Vologda Oblast|Vologda]] oblasts. 

This geographic location affords the oblast the advantages of proximity to [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg|St.&nbsp;Petersburg]]. Additionally, the [[Classification of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Yaroslavl]], the [[administrative center]] of the oblast, is served by major [[highway]]s, [[railroad]]s, and [[waterway]]s. The population of the oblast was 1,272,468 as of the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census]].<ref name="2010Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}</ref>

==Geography==
The climate of Yaroslavl Oblast is temperate continental; there are four clearly established seasons and most of the precipitation falls as showers during the warm half of the year. Winters are cold and snowy winters, and summers are quite warm. The coldest month is January, when the average temperature is  about {{convert|-8.2|C}}, while the warmest is July when the average temperature is {{convert|+18.9|C}}. 

Formerly almost all territory was covered with thick conifer forest ([[fir]], [[pine]]). After much of this was harvested, now a large portion of territory has been replaced by second-growth [[birch]]-and-[[aspen]] forests and crop fields. Swamps also take up considerable areas.

Large animals have been much reduced in numbers, but there are still some [[bear]]s, [[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[fox]]es, [[moose]], and [[wild boar]]s. A great number of wild [[bird]]s live and nest in the oblast.
In cities, the most common birds are [[rock dove|pigeons]], [[jackdaw]]s, [[hooded crow]]s, [[rook (bird)|rooks]], [[house sparrow]]s, and [[great tit]]s.

The [[Volga River]] flows through Yaroslavl Oblast; major dams and hydroelectric stations were built at [[Uglich]] and [[Rybinsk]]. The [[Rybinsk Reservoir]], filled between 1941 and 1947, is one of the largest in Europe. As it was filled the former town of [[Mologa]] and several hundreds of villages were flooded. Some 150,000 persons in Yaroslavl, Vologda, and Kalinin (now Tver) oblasts had to be relocated in connection with this project.

Mineral resources are limited to construction materials (such as [[sand]], [[gravel]], [[clay]]) and [[peat]]. There are also mineral water springs and wells.

==History==
People first settled in the area of the modern-day Yaroslavl Oblast during the [[Paleolithic Era]] at  the end of the [[last glacial period]]. The [[Fatyanovo–Balanovo culture]] is believed to have introduced agriculture in the region not later than the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. The earliest historically documented inhabitants of the Yaroslavl region were the Volga Finnic [[Merya people|Merya]] people. They were known to come into close contact with [[Balto-Slavic]] tribes of [[Krivichs]] and [[Slovens]] from the 9th to the 10th centuries AD; they eventually blended into a single cultural community with other people of the [[Kievan Rus']].

===Early medieval Rus'===
The oblast has belonged to the core of the Russian lands since the early Middle Ages. [[Rostov, Yaroslavl Oblast|Rostov]], the oldest city in the region, was first mentioned in records in 862AD. It soon became the main political and religious centers of the Northeast [[Kievan Rus']]. (The Rostov [[eparchy]] established in 991 was one of the earliest in Russia.) Many notable [[Rurikid]] princes had their fief in Rostov: among them were [[Boris and Gleb|St. Boris]] and [[Yaroslav the Wise]], the founder of the city of [[Yaroslavl]].

In 1054 Rostov and other North-Eastern lands were inherited by Yaroslav's son [[Vsevolod I of Kiev|Vsevolod]], who also ruled the southern [[Principality of Pereyaslavl]]. Remaining in their distant capital, the princes of [[Pereiaslav|Pereyaslavl]] ruled the province through their viceregents. In that period the 1071 [[smerd]] rebellion was led by still powerful [[volkhvy|magi]] of Yarsolavl, during which bishop Leontius of Rostov was murdered.

In the early 12th century, Rostov got its own prince, [[Yuri Dolgoruky]], the grandson of [[Vsevolod I of Kiev|Vsevolod]]. He moved his capital to [[Suzdal]] in 1125, diminishing the influence of Rostov.  During his reign, Dolgoruky founded many major cities of the Northeast Rus, including [[Pereslavl-Zalessky|Pereslavl]], [[Uglich]], and [[Tutayev|Romanov]] of the modern-day Yaroslavl Oblast. Prince [[Andrey Bogolyubsky]], who succeeded his father [[Yuri Dolgoruky|Yury]] as a ruler of the Rostov-Suzdal lands in 1157, was the first Russian ruler to give up his claims for the thrones of [[Kiev]] and [[Pereiaslav|Pereyaslavl]]. He proclaimed himself a Grand Prince and moved his capital to the city of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], near Suzdal, marking the beginning of the [[Vladimir-Suzdal Principality]].

After the death of Andrey's brother [[Vsevolod the Big Nest]] in 1212, the Russian North-East suffered a period of [[feudal fragmentation]]. [[Rostov, Yaroslavl Oblast|Rostov]], [[Yaroslavl]], [[Pereslavl-Zalessky|Pereslavl]] and [[Uglich]] became principalities in their own right, while their princes still recognized the formal suzerainty of the Grand Princes of Vladimir.

===Tatar Yoke era===
Northeastern Rus was attacked by the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol-Tatar armies]] in the winter of 1238. [[Pereslavl-Zalessky|Pereslavl]] struggled against the attack for five days, losing most of its population. Rostov and Uglich both fell without a fight. Grand Prince [[Yuri II of Vladimir]] was killed, along with his nephews, princes of Rostov and Yaroslavl, in the [[Battle of the Sit River]] in the northern part of the region. As a result of the invasion, the Vladimir-Suzdal domain was obliged to pay tribute to the conquerors and submit to their political will.

During the 13th and 14th centuries, Rostov and Yaroslavl principalities continued to split up and weaken. They became easy targets for other, more powerful princes, most importantly the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|House of Moscow]]. In 1302 Ivan of Pereslavl bequeathed his principality to [[Daniel of Moscow]]. In 1328 [[Ivan I of Moscow]] bought out the Uglich principality. Starting with 1332, Muscovites began to acquire parts of the Rostov Principality little by little, completely subduing it by the middle of the 15th century. In 1380 soldiers of the Rostov and Yaroslavl principalities joined the allied army of Moscow prince [[Dmitry Donskoy]] in the [[Battle of Kulikovo]].

[[Ivan III the Great]] completed the gathering of the Russian lands in the Yaroslavl Oblast. In 1463 he forced the last prince of Yaroslavl, Alexander Bryukhaty, to sell all of his possessions. In 1474 Ivan III bought the rest of the territories that were still co-owned with Moscow by the House of Rostov.

===Tsardom of Russia===
In the 16th century [[Yaroslavl]] became a major trade center, connecting Central Russia with the lower regions of [[Volga]], as well as [[Arkhangelsk]], the main trading outpost of the British [[Muscovy Company]]. At the same time Rostov continued as a center of the richest and one of the most influential [[eparchy|eparchies]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. Rostov archbishops were granted a [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] status in 1589.

During the [[Time of Troubles]] of the early 17th century, Rostov and Yaroslavl provinces were raided by the rebel forces of [[False Dmitry II]] and his [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish–Lithuanian]] allies. From 1609 to 1610 the invaders were driven out by a Russian militia of Gagarin and Vysheslavtsev, who gathered their forces in [[Vologda]].  In late 1614, the northern part of the region ([[Poshekhonye]]) was terrorized by a rogue [[cossack]] unit led by ataman Baloven. The next year surrounding areas of [[Uglich]] and [[Tutayev|Romanov]] were reached by the notorious [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish–Lithuanian]] [[Lisowczycy]] raiders. In 1618 [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] of hetman [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny|Sahaidachny]] captured Yaroslavl, Pereslavl and Romanov, as allies with a Polish invasion of Russia.

Later in the 17th century, Yaroslavl's commercial growth made it more important than ever. By the middle of the century, it was the second-biggest Russian city, with population of 15,000 people. Starting in 1692, Pereslavl and Rostov were finally subjected to Yaroslavl. In 1719, after a new administrative reform, territories of the modern oblast were divided between the Yaroslavl and Uglich provinces of the [[Saint Petersburg Governorate]], and the Pereslavl and Kostroma provinces of the [[Moscow Governorate]]. In 1727 Yaroslavl and Uglich were also taken over by Moscow.

===Russian Empire===
After the foundation of [[Saint Petersburg]] and a subsequent decline of the northern trading routes, Yaroslav lost its role as a major trade center and second-most important Russian city. The city continued to be integral to development of its region and industrial growth. In 1718 the first public elementary school was established in Yaroslavl; in 1747 Spaso-Preobrazhensky monastery opened a seminary. In 1750 young Yaroslavl socialite [[Fyodor Volkov]] organized the first permanent theater in Russia.

In 1777 a separate [[Yaroslavl Governorate]] (then viceroyalty) was established; it included surrounding areas of [[Yaroslavl]], [[Rostov, Yaroslavl Oblast|Rostov]] and [[Uglich]]. As a part of the reform, many settlements of the region were granted town status, namely [[Rybinsk]], [[Poshekhonye]], [[Myshkin (town)|Myshkin]] and [[Mologa]]. The archbishop of Rostov moved his permanent residence from Rostov to Yaroslavl. In 1803 [[Pavel Grigoryevich Demidov|Pavel Demidov]] founded the Yaroslavl School of Higher Studies, the first university college in the governorate.

From the 18th century, Rostov became widely known for its [[finift]]-enamel jewelry crafts. In 1850 the first Russian tobacco factory, Balkanskaya Zvezda, was opened in Yaroslavl. Railroads were constructed and connected the Yaroslavl region with [[Moscow]] in 1870 and [[Vologda]] in 1872. In 1879 [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] helped to create the first oil refinery in the empire near [[Romanov-Borisoglebsk]]. During the 1910s the region began to develop as a major center of the burgeoning automotive industry: in 1916 new factories were founded in [[Rybinsk]] ([[NPO Saturn|Russky Renault]]) and Yaroslavl (Lebedev Automobile Factory).

===Soviet years===
After the Russian Revolution and [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]], Soviet power in the Yaroslavl Governorate was installed in a relatively peaceful way. The Yaroslavl and Rybinsk revolts of July 1918 had been organized by [[Boris Savinkov]]'s Union for the Defense of the Motherland and Freedom. In Rybinsk, [[Cheka]] aided by the [[Red Army]] dealt with the rebels in one day, but in Yaroslavl the clashes continued for two weeks. To put the Yaroslavl rebels down, the Reds used their artillery and aviation. Both sides lost more than a thousand people during those events, and thousands of Yaroslavl families lost their homes in the subsequent fires. Although the revolts were unsuccessful, they drew a significant part of Bolshevik forces to Central Russia. In that period, the opposition [[White movement|Whites]] captured [[Yekaterinburg]], [[Simbirsk]], and [[Kazan]].

From 1921 to 1923, the northern part of the governorate became a separate Rybinsk Governorate; it was later returned to Yaroslavl jurisdiction. In 1929, the region was split between Yaroslavl and Rybinsk okrugs, which became a part of the newly established [[Ivanovo Oblast|Ivanovo Industrial Oblast]]. 

Yaroslavl Oblast was created on 11 March 1936, and it included most of the former Yaroslavl Governorate, together with a big par itself, and [[Pereslavl-Zalessky]] of the [[Vladimir Governorate]]. In 1944, the Yaroslavl Oblast gained its current borders after the [[Kostroma Oblast]] was organized as a separate region.
[[File:Yaroslavl-old-photo40.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Ilyinskaya square in [[Yaroslavl]]]]
During the 1930s under [[Josef Stalin]], the Yaroslavl Oblast went through rapid forced industrialization under the first [[five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|five year plans]]. In 1935, construction of the Rybinsk dam began; it was followed by creation of the [[Rybinsk Reservoir]], the largest man-made body of water on Earth at that time, which inundated the entire former city of [[Mologa]]. Some 150,000 people had to be relocated from the city and other villages that were flooded by filling the reservoir. 

By the early 1940s, the oblast had become one of the most industrialized regions of Russia. Its biggest economic centers were Yaroslavl (53% of the industrial output), Rybinsk (17%), and Kostroma (11%). Economic growth was accompanied with social and cultural development. A number of higher education institutes, theaters, and a philharmonia were founded in Yaroslavl and Rybinsk. The region was also significantly affected by the [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|political repressions of that time]] and Stalin's purges. During the period from 1918 to 1975, some 18,155 people were given sentences for political crimes, and 2,219 were sentenced to death.

Although this was a rear region in the course of [[World War II]], the Yaroslavl Oblast was in danger of invasion by [[Nazi Germany]]. Many regional manufacturers were relocated eastwards, and two strong lines of defense were constructed in late 1941. Out of 500,000 residents of the oblast sent to fight on the front lines, 200,000 (1/10 of the entire population) never returned and were presumed dead. 

Soon after the end of the war, the oblast and national government completed such projects as construction of the Rybinsk Hydroelectric Power Station and establishing new industries. From the late 1960s, the local [[Poshekhonye]] brand of cheese received recognition throughout Russia. In 1979, Yarslavl started to host what is now the oldest jazz festival in Russia, ''Jazz Nad Volgoi'' ('Jazz on the Volga').

===Modern history===
On 30 October 1997, Yaroslavl, alongside [[Astrakhan Oblast|Astrakhan]], [[Kirov Oblast|Kirov]], [[Murmansk Oblast|Murmansk]], and [[Ulyanovsk Oblast|Ulyanovsk]] signed a power-sharing agreement with the government of Russia; it and the other oblasts gained autonomy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/yeltsin-signs-power-sharing-agreements-with-five-more-russian-regions/|title=Yeltsin Signs Power-Sharing Agreements With Five More Russian Regions|date=1997-11-03|website=Jamestown|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref> After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia abolished this agreement on 15 March 2002.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chuman|first=Mizuki|title=The Rise and Fall of Power-Sharing Treaties Between Center and Regions in Post-Soviet Russia|url=http://demokratizatsiya.pub/archives/19_2_L7H017206G216817.pdf|journal=Demokratizatsiya|pages=146}}</ref>

==Politics==
[[image:Oblast-governement-yar.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Seat of the Oblast government in Sovetskaya Square]]
During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the oblast was shared among three persons: The first secretary of the Yaroslavl CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost this predominant power. The head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor, were appointed/elected alongside the members of the elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

In the 21st century, the Charter of Yaroslavl Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The [[Yaroslavl Oblast Duma]] is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly passes laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and supervises the implementation and observance of such acts. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies, such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day-to-day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor, who is the highest official, and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].

==Economy==
The engineering and metalworking industry is the region's primary industrial sector, which supplies Russia with a wide variety of products. This industry is actively involved in foreign economic relations with CIS and other foreign countries.

Agriculture in the Oblast is mainly concerned with growing [[potato]]es, [[vegetables]], and [[flax]], raising [[beef]] and [[dairy cattle]], [[pig]]s, and [[sheep]] and [[fishing]] (on the [[Rybinskoe Reservoir]]).

===Natural resources===
