During Roman antiquity, the city of [[Vlorë]], the homonymous county capital, was known as ''Aulón'' ({{Langx|grc|Αυλών}}, {{langx|la|Aulona}}, meaning channel or glen in Greek, and possibly a translation of another indigenous name).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&dq=Aulon+Vlore+etymology&pg=PA398 google book reference]: Placenames of the World: Origins and Meanings of the Names for 6,600 Countries, Cities, Territories, Natural Features, and Historic Sites By Adrian Room Published by McFarland, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-7864-2248-7}}, 433 pages.</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1BMrAAAAMAAJ&q=Vlonë+Gheg|year=1974|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|isbn=0-85229-290-2|page=479}}</ref> The city was mentioned for the first time by [[Ptolemy]] (2nd century CE) among the towns of the Illyrian [[Taulantii]].{{sfn|Bereti|Quantin|Cabanes|2011|pp=11, 13}}

In the middle of the 14th century the aristocratic Delvina family ruled Delvinë, and in 1354 Mehmet Ali Pasha Delvina was testified as the owner of the castle and the city.

The [[Ottoman Empire]] captured the region in 1417, while in 1432, Albanian rebels freed Vlorë and expelled the Ottomans from the area.<ref name="Giakoumis9596">{{cite book |last=Giakoumis |first=Konstantinos |title=Religion und Kultur im albanischsprachigen Südosteuropa &#91;Religion and culture in Albanian-speaking southeastern Europe&#93; |publisher=Peter Lang |year=2010 |isbn=9783631602959 |editor1-last=Schmitt |editor1-first=Oliver Jens |location=Frankfurt am Main |pages=95–96 |chapter=The Orthodox Church in Albania Under the Ottoman Rule 15th-19th Century |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aCdYHU9PtiIC&q=Durr%C3%ABs}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=İnalcik |first=Halil |title=Hicr ı835 tarihli sûret-i defter-i sancak-i Arvanid |publisher=Türk Tarih Kurumu Yayınlarından |year=1954 |language=tr}}</ref> As part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], The region became a ''[[sanjak]]'' centre in [[Rumelia Eyalet]] under the name ''Avlonya''.

On November 28, 1912, [[Ismail Qemali|Ismail Kemal]] declared the [[Albanian National Awakening]] in Vlorë, during the [[First Balkan War]]. The region became Albania's first freed region following its independence, but was [[Albania during World War I|invaded by Italy]] in 1914, during [[World War I]]. The region remained occupied by Italian forces until an [[Vlora War|Albanian rebellion]] forced the Italians out of [[Albania]] in 1920. Italy [[Italian invasion of Albania|invaded Vlorë]] again in 1939. The region remained under Italian occupation until Italy surrendered to the allies in 1943. Subsequently, [[Nazi Germany]] occupied the region until 1944. The city was liberated in 1944 by [[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|communist forces]] under [[Enver Hoxha]].

During the [[World War II]], [[Sazan Island]] became the site of a German and Italian [[submarine base]] and naval installations; these installations were heavily bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].

After World War II, with Albania ruled by a [[Party of Labour of Albania|Communist Party]], the port was leased out to the [[Soviet Union]] for use as a submarine base. During 1960 and 1961 it served as a theater in the aftermath of the decision of [[Enver Hoxha]] to denounce [[Nikita Khrushchev|Nikita Khrushchev's]] reforms. In April 1961 the Soviet Union, resenting being pushed out after considerable investment in the naval facilities at [[Pasha Liman Base]], threatened to occupy the region with Soviet troops, and cut off all Soviet economic, military and technical aid to Albania.

Vlorë County has the second highest human development after Tirana County, and has a High Human Development Rating within Albania.

The county remains a major seaport and commercial centre, with a significant [[fishing]] and [[Manufacturing|industrial]] sector. The city of [[Vlorë]] is the economic hub of the county. The surrounding region of the city is mainly agricultural and pastoral; a large producer of [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], [[bitumen]] and [[salt]]. Vlorë has grown in importance as an agricultural center with large-scale planting of [[olive]] and [[citrus fruit]] trees, and as a center of the food processing, oil and bitumen export industries.

According to the World Bank, Vlorë has made significant steps in the ease of starting a business in 2016. It ranks seventh among 22 cities in [[Southeast Europe|Southeastern Europe]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/Rankings/south-east-europe|title = Economy}}</ref> being placed higher than the capital [[Tirana]], [[Belgrade]] and [[Sarajevo]].

[[Tourism]] has become a major industry in recent years, with many hotels, recreational centers, and vast beaches. In [[Sarandë]], tourism is the main driver of the economy. It is a significant tourist destination on the [[Ionian Sea]], and by far one of the most popular destinations in [[Albania]]. Vlorë County is considered a prosperous region, one with varied attractions, plants and mountains, rivers and lakes, springs and virgin beaches, citrus plantations, olive groves and vineyards, pastures and woods, fish and shellfish farming and desirable hunting places.

In short, Vlorë County's location is advantageous in terms of development of tourism. Sarandë's stony beaches are respectable, and there are plenty of sights in and around town, including the ancient archaeological site of [[Butrint]] and the hypnotic [[Blue Eye, Albania|Blue Eye Spring]].
