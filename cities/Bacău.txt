With a population of 136,087 (as of [[2021 Romanian census|2021 census]]), Bacău is the [[List of cities and towns in Romania|14th largest city]] in Romania.<ref name="RPL2021">{{cite web|url=https://www.recensamantromania.ro/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tabel-1.03_1.3.1-si-1.03.2.xls|title=Populația rezidentă după grupa de vârstă, pe județe și municipii, orașe, comune, la 1 decembrie 2021|publisher=[[National Institute of Statistics (Romania)|INSSE]]|language=ro|date=31 May 2023}}</ref> The city is situated in the historical region of [[Western Moldavia|Moldavia]], at the foothills of the [[Carpathian Mountains]], and on the [[Bistrița River (Siret)|Bistrița River]] (which meets the [[Siret River]] about {{convert|8|km|mi}} to the south of Bacău). The [[Ghimeș Pass]] links Bacău to the region of [[Transylvania]].

==Etymology==
The town's name, which features in Old Church Slavonic documents as ''Bako'', ''Bakova'' or ''Bakovia'', comes most probably from a [[personal name]].<ref>Rădvan 2010, p. 371.</ref> Men bearing the name Bakó or Bako are documented in medieval [[Transylvania]]<ref name='Rădvan 456'>Rădvan 2010, p. 456.</ref> and in 15th-century Bulgaria, but according to Victor Spinei the name itself is of [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]{{spaced ndash}}most probably of [[Cuman language|Cuman]] or [[Pecheneg language|Pecheneg]]{{spaced ndash}}origin.<ref>Spinei 2009, p. 342.</ref> Nicolae Iorga believes that the city's name is of Hungarian origin (as [[Adjud]] and [[Sascut]]).<ref>Nicolae Iorga: Privilegiile șangăilor dela Târgu-Ocna, Extras din Analele Academiei Române, seria II, tom. XXXVII (1915), p. 246</ref> Another theory suggests that the town's name has a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] origin, pointing to the [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] word ''byk'', meaning "ox" or "bull", the region being very suitable for raising cattle; the term, rendered into [[Romanian alphabet]] as ''bâc'', was probably the origin of ''Bâcău''.<ref name="a">[[Gh. Ghibănescu]] - Ispisoace și Zapise. vol.VI, partea a II-a, Tipografia „Dacia” Iliescu, Grossu & Comp., Iași, 1926, pag.177</ref> In German it is known as ''Bakau'', in Hungarian as ''Bákó'' and in Turkish as ''Baka''.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

== History ==
Similarly to most [[urban center]]s in Moldavia, Bacău emerged on a [[Ford (crossing)|ford]] that allowed water passage.<ref>Rădvan 2010, p. 332.</ref> There is archaeological evidence of human settlement in the centre of Bacău (near Curtea Domnească) dating from the 6th and the 7th centuries; these settlements were placed over older settlements from the 4th and the 5th centuries. A number of vessels found here are ornamented with crosses, hinting that the inhabitants were Christians.<ref>Dan Gh. Teodor, ''Creștinismul la est de Carpati'', Editura Mitropoliei Moldovei și Bucovinei, Iași, 1984, p. 25, 32, 160.</ref> Pechenegs and Cumans controlled the Bistrița valley during the 10th, 11th and 12th centuries.<ref>Eugen Șendrea, ''Istoria municipiului Bacău'', Bacău, Editura Vicovia, 2007, p.45-90.</ref> [[Colonist]]s played a significant role in the development of the town.<ref>Rădvan 2010, p. 388.</ref> Archaeological finds, some surface or semi-buried dwellings from the second half of the 15th&nbsp;century, suggest that [[Hungarians]] started to settle in the region after 1345&ndash;1347 when the territory was under the control of the [[Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages|Kingdom of Hungary]].<ref>Rădvan 2010, pp. 388., 427., 455.</ref> They mainly occupied the flat banks of the river Bistrița.<ref>Dobre 2009, p. 86.</ref> Discoveries of a type of 14th-century grey ceramic that has also been found in [[Northern Europe]] also suggests the presence of [[Germans|German]] colonists from the north.<ref>Rădvan 2010, p. 365.</ref> Originally the town focused around the [[Roman Catholic]] community that settled near a regular local [[Marketplace|market]] frequented by the population of the region on the lower reaches of the river.<ref name='Rădvan 456'/>

The town was first mentioned in 1408 when Prince [[Alexander the Good]] of Moldavia (1400&ndash;1432) listed the [[Custom house|customs points]] in the principality in his privilege for [[Polish people|Polish]] merchants.<ref>Rădvan 2010, p. 343.</ref><ref>Treptow, Popa 1996, pp. ''lii.'', 32.</ref> The customs house in the town is mentioned in [[Old Church Slavonic]] as ''krainee mîto'' ("the customs house by the edge") in the document which may indicate that it was the last customs stop before Moldavia's border with [[Wallachia]].<ref>Rădvan 2010, pp. 453-454.</ref> 
An undated document reveals that the ''șoltuz'' in Bacău, that is the head of the town elected by its inhabitants, had the right to sentence felons to death, at least for robberies, which hints to an extended privilege, similar to the ones that royal towns in the Kingdom of Hungary enjoyed.<ref>Rădvan 2010, pp. 399., 456.</ref><ref>Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 188.</ref> Thus this right may have been granted to the community when the territory was under the control of the Kingdom of Hungary.<ref name='Rădvan 456'/> The [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] of Bacău was oval which is exceptional in Moldavia where the seals of other towns were round.<ref>Rădvan 2010, pp. 406., 455.</ref>

Alexander the Good donated the wax collected as part of the tax payable by the town to the nearby [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[Bistrița Monastery]].<ref>Rădvan 2010, pp. 416-417.</ref> It was most probably his first wife named Margaret who founded the [[Franciscan]] Church of the Holy Virgin in Bacău.<ref name='Rădvan 455'/> But the main Catholic church in the town was dedicated to [[Saint Nicholas]].<ref name='Rădvan 456'/> A letter written by John of Rya, the Catholic bishop of [[Baia]] refers to Bacău as a ''civitas'' which implies the existence of a Catholic bishopric in the town at that time.<ref name='Rădvan 455'>Rădvan 2010, p. 455.</ref><ref>Dobre 2009, p. 70.</ref> The letter also reveals that [[Hussite]] immigrants who had undergone persecutions in [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], or Hungary were settled in the town and granted privileges by Alexander the Good.<ref>Rădvan 2010, p. 497.</ref>

The monastery of Bistrița was also granted the income from the customs house of Bacău in 1439.<ref>Rădvan 2010, pp. 373., 416.</ref> In 1435 [[Stephen II of Moldavia]] (1433&ndash;1435, 1436&ndash;1447) requested the town's judges not to hinder the merchants of [[Brașov]], an important center of the [[Transylvanian Saxons]] in their movement.<ref>Rădvan 2010, p. 410.</ref><ref>Treptow, Popa 1996, pp. ''lii.'', 48.</ref>
From the 15th&nbsp;century ''ungureni'', that is [[Romanians]] from Transylvania began to populate the area north of the marketplace where they would erect an Orthodox church after 1500.<ref name='Rădvan 456'/> A small residence of the princes of Moldova was built in the town in the first half of the 15th&nbsp;century.<ref name='Rădvan 454'>Rădvan 2010, p. 454.</ref> It was rebuilt and extended under [[Stephen III the Great]] of Moldavia (1457&ndash;1504) who also erected an Orthodox church within it.<ref name='Rădvan 454'/> But the rulers soon began to donate the neighboring villages that had thereto supplied their local household to monasteries or noblemen.<ref>Treptow, Popa 1996, pp. ''lii.'', 46.</ref> Thus the local princely residence was abandoned after 1500.<ref name='Rădvan 457'>Rădvan 2010, p. 457.</ref>

The town was invaded and destroyed more than one time in the 15th and 16th&nbsp;centuries.<ref name='Rădvan 457'/> For example, in 1467 King [[Matthias I of Hungary]] during his expedition against Stephen the Great set fire to all towns, among them Bacău in his path.<ref>Rădvan 2010, p. 461.</ref> The customs records of [[Brașov]] shows that few merchants from Bacău crossed the [[Carpathian Mountains]] into Transylvania after 1500, and their merchandise had no particularly high value which suggests that the town was declining in this period.<ref name='Rădvan 457'/>

The Catholic bishop of [[Curtea de Argeș|Argeș]] whose see in Wallachia had been destroyed by the [[Crimean Tatars|Tatars]] moved to Bacău in 1597.<ref name='Rădvan 457'/><ref>Benda 2002, p. 33.</ref> From the early 17th&nbsp;century the bishops of Bacău were Polish priests who did not reside in the town, but in the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]].<ref name='Benda 36'>Benda 2002, p. 36.</ref> They only travelled time to time to their see in order to collect the [[tithes]].<ref name='Benda 36'/>

According to Archbishop Marco Bandini's report of the [[canonical visitation]] of 1646, the ''șoltuz'' in Bacău was elected among Hungarians one year, and another, among Romanians.<ref name='Rădvan 456'/><ref name="Benda 35"/> The names of most of 12 inhabitants of the town recorded in 1655 also indicate that Hungarians still formed their majority group.<ref name='Rădvan 457'/> In 1670 Archbishop Petrus Parcevic, the [[Apostolic vicariate|apostolic vicar]] of Moldavia concluded an agreement with the head of the Franciscan Province of Transylvania on the return of the Bacău monastery to them in order to ensure the spiritual welfare of the local Hungarian community.<ref name='Benda 35'>Benda 2002, p. 17.</ref><ref>Pozsony 2002, pp. 94-95.</ref> But the Polish bishop protested against the agreement and the [[Holy See]] also refused to ratify it.<ref name='Benda 35'/><ref>Pozsony 2002, p. 95.</ref>

Due to the frequent invasions by foreign armies and plundering by the Tatars in the 17th&nbsp;century, many of its Catholic inhabitants abandoned Bacău and took refuge in Transylvania.<ref>Mărtinaș 1999, pp.36-38.</ref>{{better source needed|date=November 2021}} But in 1851 the Catholic congregation in the town still spoke, sang, and prayed in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].<ref>Pozsony 2002, p. 102.</ref>

The first [[paper mill]] in Moldavia was established in the town in 1851.<ref name='Treptow 32'>Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 32.</ref> The town was declared a [[Municipiu|municipality]] in 1968.<ref name='Treptow 32'/>

==Climate==
Bacău has a type of [[humid continental climate|continental climate]] that falls short of permanent winter snow cover due days averaging above freezing. Winters are also quite dry in the area. Summers are quite rainy due to [[convection]] and temperatures are often hot due to its inland location. Due to its mid-latitude location surrounded by a vast landmass, Bacău has a large temperature amplitude by European standards. Since 1980, a record heat of {{convert|42.5|C|F}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.infoclimat.fr/climatologie/annee/2012/bacau/valeurs/15150.html|title=Climatologie de l'année 2012 à Bacau|publisher=Infoclimat|language=fr|access-date=21 October 2023}}</ref> and a record cold of {{convert|-28|C|F}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.infoclimat.fr/climatologie/annee/1985/bacau/valeurs/15150.html|title=Climatologie de l'année 1985 à Bacau|publisher=Infoclimat|language=fr|access-date=21 October 2023}}</ref> have been measured, which is a net difference of {{convert|70.5|C-change}}.

==Politics==
The local authority in the city is split between the Mayor and the Local Council. Between 1950 and 1968 the city was governed by the Sfatul popular (People's Council). It replaced the local Provisional Committee ({{langx|ro|Comitetul Provizori}}), which functioned from 1948 to 1950, based on the Law of the People's Councils, no. 17/1949.<ref>Andrei Florin Sora, Comunizarea administrației românești: sfaturile populare (1949-1950), în „Revista istorică”, tom XXIII, nr. 3-4/2012</ref>

As of [[2021 Romanian census|2021 census]] data, Bacău has a population of 136,087,<ref name="RPL2021"/> a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2011 census.

At the [[2011 Romanian census|2011 census]], Bacău had a population of 144,307, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census.<ref name="INSSER">{{cite web | url = http://www.recensamantromania.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sR_Tab_8.xls | title = Population as of 20 October 2011 | date = 5 July 2013 | access-date = 4 January 2016 | publisher = [[National Institute of Statistics (Romania)|INSSE]] | language = ro | archive-date = 18 January 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160118131243/http://www.recensamantromania.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sR_Tab_8.xls | url-status = dead }}</ref> The ethnic makeup was as follows:

* [[Romani people|Roma]]: 0.92%
* [[Hungarians]]: 0.09%
* [[Jews]]: 0.03%
* Other: 0.34%

The [[Bacău metropolitan area]], a project for the creation of an administrative unit to integrate Bacău with the nearby communes, would have a population of some 190,000.

== Transportation ==

The city is about {{convert|300|km|0|abbr=off}} North of [[Bucharest]]. It is served by [[George Enescu International Airport]], located at {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}}, which provides direct links with the Romanian capital, [[Bucharest]], and with several cities in Europe. Bacău air traffic control centre is one of Europe's busiest, as it handles transiting flights between the Middle and Near East and South Asia to Europe and across the Atlantic.

[[File:Complexul muzeal Iulian Antonescu Bacau.jpg|thumb|right|Museum Complex '"[[Complexul Muzeal Iulian Antonescu din Bacău|Iulian Antonescu]]"]]

The [[Bacău railway station]] (''Gara Bacău'') is one of the busiest in Romania; it has access to the Romanian railway main trunk number 500. Thus the city is connected to the main Romanian cities; the railway station is an important transit stop for international trains from [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]], and [[Bulgaria]].

The city has access to the [[DN2]] road ([[European route E85|E85]]) that links it to the Romanian capital, Bucharest (to the South) and the cities of [[Suceava]] and [[Iași]] (to the North). The [[European route]] [[European route E574|E574]] is an important access road to Transylvania and the city of [[Brașov]]. The city is also located at the intersection of several national roads of secondary importance, and will be served in the future by the [[A7 motorway (Romania)|A7 motorway]] running from the border with [[Ukraine]] at [[Siret]] to [[Ploiești]] (junction with [[A3 motorway (Romania)|A3]]). As of 2020, this motorway intersects with the Bacău bypass (''Centura Bacău'').

== Culture ==
Bacău has a public university and several colleges. Two major Romanian poets, [[George Bacovia]] and [[Vasile Alecsandri]] were born here. The "[[Mihail Jora]]" Athenaeum and a Philharmonic Orchestra are located here, as well as the "G. Bacovia" Dramatic Theater and a Puppet Theater. Around Christmas every year, a Festival of Moldavian Winter Traditions takes place, reuniting folk artists from all the surrounding regions. The exhibition "[[Saloanele Moldovei]]" and the International Painting Camp at [[Tescani]], near Bacău, reunite important plastic artists from Romania and from abroad.
The local History Museum, part of the Museum Complex "[[Complexul Muzeal Iulian Antonescu din Bacău|Iulian Antonescu]]" has an important collection of antique objects from ancient [[Dacia]]. The city also has an astronomical observatory, The Victor Anestin Astronomical Observatory.{{cn|date=March 2024}}
