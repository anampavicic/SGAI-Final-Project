== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Tabriz|Azerbaijan (Iran)|History of the Caucasus|History of Iran}}

===Early history===
The early history of Tabriz is not well documented. The earliest civilization signs in the city belongs to an Iron Age grave yard of 1st millennium B.C. which were unearthed in late 1990s in northern side of [[Blue Mosque, Tabriz|Blue Mosque]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eachto.ir/farsi/content/view/521/381/ |title=Iron Age excavation site's museum |language=fa |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621040438/http://www.eachto.ir/farsi/content/view/521/381/ |archive-date=2010-06-21}}</ref> The city also inscribed as old as 714 B.C. on as Tarui or Tauris, on the Assyrian King [[Sargon II]]'s epigraph in 714 B.C.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://algebra21.tabrizu.ac.ir/en/contents/AboutTabriz/Tabriz.City.html |title=Introduction to Tabriz city |language=fa |publisher=University of Tabriz |access-date=2013-02-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517034733/http://algebra21.tabrizu.ac.ir/en/contents/AboutTabriz/Tabriz.City.html |archive-date=2013-05-17}}</ref>

Egyptologist [[David Rohl]] suggested that the legendary [[Garden of Eden]] was near Tabriz. Archaeologist [[Eric H. Cline]] commented on Rohl's views, writing that "his suggestions have not caught on with the scholarly establishment. His argument is not helped by the fact that it depends upon speculations regarding the transmission of place-names for both the various rivers and nearby related areas from antiquity to the present. In the end, while Rohl's suggestion is not out of the question, it seems no more probable than any other hypothesis, and less likely than those suggested by Speiser, Zarins, and Sauer."<ref>{{cite book |last=Cline |first=Eric H. |title=From Eden to Exile: Unraveling Mysteries of the Bible |publisher=National Geographic |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4262-0084-7 |page=10}}</ref>

Since the earliest documented history of Tabriz, it has been chosen as the capital for several rulers commencing from [[Atropates]] era and his dynasty. It is likely the city has been destroyed multiple times either by natural disasters or by the invading armies. The earliest elements of the present Tabriz are claimed to be built either at the time of the early [[Sassanids]] in the 3rd or 4th century AD, or later in the 7th century.<ref name="Cambridge">{{The Cambridge History of Iran|volume=1|first1=William Bayne |last1=Fisher |chapter=Physical Geography |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2pO-mttL50C&pg=PA14}}</ref> The city used to be called ''T'awrēš'' in [[Middle Persian]].

=== From the Arab conquest to the Constitutional Revolution ===
[[File:Tabriz-16.PNG|thumb|16th-century schematic map of Tabriz by [[Matrakçı Nasuh]]]]
After the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Muslim conquest of Iran]], the [[Arabia]]n [[Azd]] tribe from [[Yemen]] resided in Tabriz. The development of post-Islamic Tabriz began as of this time. The Islamic geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] says that Tabriz was a village before Rawwad from the tribe of Azd arrive at Tabriz.<ref name="EI2"/> In 791 AD, [[Zubaidah bint Ja'far|Zubaidah]], the wife of [[Abbasid]] caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]], rebuilt Tabriz after a devastating earthquake and beautified the city so much as to obtain the credit for having been its founder.<ref name="chap.sch.ir" /><ref name="eastwick327">{{cite book |first=Edward Backhouse |last=Eastwick |title=Journal of a Diplomat's Three Years' Residence in Persia |publisher=Smith, Elder and Co. |year=1864 |page=327}}</ref>

In the [[Ramadan]] of 1208, Tabriz, as well as its adjacent cities and territories were conquered by the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] under [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar the Great]], as a response to the massacre of 12,000 Christians in the Georgian-controlled city of [[Ani]] on [[Easter]] day by Muslims. In nearby [[Ardebil]], conquered by the [[Georgians]] as well, as many as 12,000 Muslims were killed.<ref>{{cite book |last1=L.

After the [[Mongol]] invasion, Tabriz came to eclipse [[Maragheh]] as the later [[Ilkhanid]] [[Mongols|Mongol]] capital of [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]] until it was sacked by [[Timur]] in 1392.{{dubious|date=February 2021}}

Chosen as a capital by [[Abaqa Khan]], fourth ruler of the Ilkhanate, for its favored location in the northwestern grasslands,<ref name="Morgan-p142">David Morgan, ''The Mongols'' p. 142</ref> in 1295, his successor [[Ghazan Khan]] made it the chief administrative centre of an empire stretching from [[Anatolia]] to the [[Oxus River]] and from the [[Caucasus]] to the [[Indian Ocean]]. Under his rule, new walls were built around the city, and numerous public buildings, educational facilities, and caravansarais were erected to serve traders travelling on the ancient [[Silk Road]]. The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Gregory Chioniades]] is said to have served as the city's [[Greek Orthodox|Orthodox]] bishop during this time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In the 13th century, many western expediters who visited Tabriz on their way to the east were amazed by the richness of the city, its magnificent buildings and its institutions.<ref>Will Durant, The Reformation: The Story of Civilization, Volume VI, Chapter XXX.</ref>

[[Marco Polo]] travelled the Silk Road, passing Tabriz about 1275, described it as: "a great city surrounded by beautiful and pleasant gardens. It is excellently situated so the goods brought to here coming from many regions.

From 1375 to 1468, Tabriz was the capital of [[Qara Qoyunlu]] state in Azerbaijan,<ref>V. Minorsky. "Jihān-Shāh Qara-Qoyunlu and His Poetry (Turkmenica, 9)", Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 16, No. 2 (1954), p. 277</ref> until defeat of Qara Qoyunlu ruler, [[Jahan Shah]] by [[Ag Qoyunlu]] warriors. Ag Qoyunlus selected Tabriz as their capital from 1469 to 1501. Some of the existing historical monuments including the [[Blue Mosque, Tabriz|Blue Mosque]] belong to the Qara Qoyunlu period.

In 1501, [[Ismail I]] entered Tabriz and proclaimed it the capital of his [[Safavid]] state. In 1514, after the [[Battle of Chaldiran]], Tabriz was sacked by [[Selim I]]. On 16 July 1534, prior to [[Capture of Baghdad (1534)|Ottoman conquest of Baghdad]], [[Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha]] occupied Tabriz.<ref>{{cite book |title=Suleiman the Magnificent |author=André Clot |page=91 |year=1983}}</ref> In 1555, [[Tahmasp I]] transferred its capital to [[Qazvin]] to avoid the growing threat of the Ottoman army to his capital.

Between 1585 and 1603, Tabriz was under occupation by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. After it was retaken by the [[Safavid]]s under [[Abbas the Great]], the city grew as a major commerce centre, conducting trade with the [[Ottoman Empire]], Russia, and the [[Caucasus]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/2021121 |title=The Safavid Economy as Part of the World Economy |access-date=26 December 2014 |last1=Matthee |first1=Rudolph (Rudi)}}</ref> Tabriz was occupied and sacked by Ottoman [[Murad IV]] in 1635, during the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–39)]], before being returned to Iran in the [[Treaty of Zohab]] in 1639. The city was completely devastated by a strong [[1641 Tabriz earthquake|earthquake in 1641]].<ref name="Melville">{{cite journal |last1=Melville |first1=Charles |title=Historical Monuments and Earthquakes in Tabriz |journal=Iran |date=1981 |volume=19 |pages=159–177 |doi=10.2307/4299714 |url=https://doi.org/10.2307/4299714 |publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]] |jstor=4299714}}</ref>

In summer of [[1721 Tabriz earthquake|1721, a large earthquake]] shocked Tabriz, killing about eighty thousand of its residents. The devastation continued in 1724–1725, when the city was [[Ottoman–Persian War (1722–27)|invaded by an Ottoman army]]. During this round of invasion, the Ottomans imprisoned many in Tabriz and killed about two hundred thousand residents.<ref>Tadeusz Jan Krusiński, Du Cerceau (Jean-Antoine, père), The history of the revolution of Persia, Volume 1, Edition of Father du Cerceau, London 1728</ref> The city was subsequently retaken by the Iranian army, after which a widespread famine, combined with the spread of fatal diseases, killed more of those who still remained.

At the end of the 18th century, the city was divided into several districts, each ruled by a family, until 1799, when the Qajar Prince [[Abbas Mirza]] was appointed as the governor of the city.<ref>Moše Šārôn, Studies in Islamic History and Civilization: In Honour of Professor David Ayalon, Jerusalem 1986.</ref> During the [[Qajar Iran|Qajar Empire]] the city was the residence for the crown prince. The crown prince normally served as governor of Azerbaijan province as well. Some of the most important events in this period [[Russo-Persian Wars|were the wars]] between Qajar Iran and neighbouring [[Imperial Russia]]. Prior to the forced cession of Iran's Caucasian territories—comprising what is now [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], southern [[Dagestan]], [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Armenia]]—to Imperial Russia following the two [[Russo-Persian Wars]] of the first half of the 19th century, Tabriz, being strategically located, was instrumental to the implementation of Iranian rule in its Caucasian territories. During the last Russo-Persian War ([[Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)|1826–1828]]), the city was captured for [[Russia]] in 1828 by General Prince Eristov, who marched into the city with 3,000 soldiers.<ref name="books.google.nl">''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sP_hVmik-QYC&pg=PA591 First Encyclopaedia of Islam: 1913–1936] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200903000929/https://books.google.com/books?id=sP_hVmik-QYC&pg=PA591 |date=2020-09-03 }}'' BRILL, 1993 {{ISBN|9004097961}} p. 591</ref> After Abbas Mirza and [[Ivan Paskevich]] signed [[Treaty of Turkmenchay|the peace treaty]], which granted for the irrevocable cession of the last remaining [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] territories, the Russian army retreated from the city.

=== Contemporary era ===
{{see also|Tabriz during World War I}}
{{further|Persian campaign (World War I)|Caucasus campaign}}
Thanks to the geographical closeness to the West and to communications with nearby countries' enlightenment movements, Tabriz became the centre of the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]] movements between 1905 and 1911, which led to the establishment of a parliament in Iran and the formation of a constitution. [[Sattar Khan]] and [[Bagher Khan]], two Tabrizi reformists who led Tabriz people's solidarity against the absolute monarchy, had a great role in achievement to the goals of Iran's constitutional revolution. In 1909, Tabriz was occupied by the Russian forces.{{sfn|Cronin|2013|page=323}} Four months after the constitutional revolution's success, in December 1911, the Russians [[Russian Invasion of Tabriz, 1911|reinvaded Tabriz]].

From the very start of [[World War I]], Iran declared neutrality. When the war erupted on a full scale, Tabriz and much of northwestern-northern Iran had already been ''de facto'' occupied by Russia for several years. In later years of World War I, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] troops intervened and took control of the city by defeating the Russian troops stationed there.<ref name="books.google.nl" /> By this time, the Ottoman army led by [[Enver Pasha]] threatened the whole [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian army]] in the Caucasus region.<ref name="books.google.nl" /> Russian troops recaptured the city from the Ottomans at a later stage of the war. By escalation of the [[October Revolution|revolution in Russia]], the Russian armies in Iranian Azerbaijan were evacuated, and the actual power passed into the hands of the local committee of the democrat party, with Ismail Nawbari at its head.<ref name="books.google.nl" /> Following Russia's retreat, the Ottomans captured the city once again for a few months until the decisive end of the war, and retreated thereafter. After World War I, a new era in the county's history began. [[Reza Shah|Reza Pahlavi]], brigadier-general of the [[Persian Cossack Brigade]], declared himself the king of the country following a [[coup d'état]]. He started with promises of modernization programs in Iran which was concentrated on the unification of the country, under the idea of ''one country, one nation''. This included centralization of the power and imposing restrictions on the local culture, heritage, and language in Iranian Azerbaijan, and the city of Tabriz.<ref>T. Atabaki, Azerbaijan: Ethnicity and the Struggle for Power in Iran, I.B Tauris, 2000, p. 53.</ref> The modernization and nationalization plan of Reza Shah continued until the surge of World War II.

At the final year of the [[World War II]] despite the declaration of the neutrality by the Iranian government, the country was occupied by the allied forces. The allied forces then urged Reza Pahlavi to abdicate and installed his son [[Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza]] as the new king of the country. The postwar situation was further complicated by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] aid to set up a local government called [[Azerbaijan People's Government]] in Northwest [[Iran]], having Tabriz as its capital. The new Soviet-backed local government was run by [[Ja'far Pishevari]] and held power for one year starting from 1946. Pishevari's government gave more freedom to speech and education in Azerbaijani language and promoted local cultural heritage and gained some popularity among the residents. However, after the withdrawal of Soviet forces, Pishevari's limited armed forces were crushed by the Imperial Iranian army and the Iranian government retook control of the city. One of the major establishments in the period of Pishevari's government was opening of the [[University of Tabriz]] which played a major role in the later political movements and protests in the region.<ref>Maziar Behrooz, Rebels with a cause: failure of left in Iran, I.B.

For the next 30 years, after the collapse of Azerbaijan's autonomous government, Tabriz enjoyed a stable era until the revolution in 1979. During this period the city received significant investment in its industries and transformed into a heavy-industry hub in the northwestern Iran. The need for a strong workforce increased immigration from all around Azerbaijan toward Tabriz. During this era and because of the continuous policy of the government centralization in Tehran as well as changes in communication and transportation, the city lost its historical dominance, but turned into the gate for reform and modernization of the country.

Starting with 1978 and with the heat of the [[Iranian Revolution]], revolutionary movements of some of Tabriz residents played a major role in the revolution. After the revolution, the residents of the city were unsatisfied with the outcome, mainly because of the ignorance of the revolutionary government about the rights of the Azerbaijani minority.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Another major source of dissatisfaction was the support of most of Iranian Azerbaijanis including Tabriz residents from a more liberal cleric, Grand Ayatollah [[Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari|Shariatmadari]], who was against the content of the new constitution which was mixing religion and state together. The unrest in the city calmed down after brutal crush of the protesters in Tabriz and after house arrest of Shariatmadari.<ref name="Stempel2009">{{cite book |author=John D Stempel |title=Inside the Iranian Revolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pi6TQQAACAAJ |date=1 August 2009 |publisher=Clark Group |isbn=978-0-9825057-2-4 |access-date=2015-06-20 |archive-date=2020-09-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200903000925/https://books.google.com/books?id=pi6TQQAACAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Tabriz Aerial View.JPG|thumb|Aerial view of northeast Tabriz, May 2012]]

In the 1980s, due to the [[Iran–Iraq War]], like the rest of the country, most of the construction and development projects in the city were stopped in order to fund the war costs. In addition to the indirect effects of the war, city's industrial zone, especially the oil refinery was also a major target for airstrikes by Iraqi's air forces because of the closeness to the Iraqi borderlines, and their strategic roles in the country's economy. With the escalation of the war, the attacks turned to [[War of the Cities]] and the air attacks later turned into the random strikes on the residential areas of the city in the later phase of the war.<ref>R. Bergquist, The role of airpower in the Iran-Iraq War, Air University Press, Washington DC, 1988. p. 46. & 57.</ref>

In recent years{{When|date=October 2023}}, Tabriz is much more stable and the new developments in the city are rapidly changing the face of the city.

===Capital of dynasties, empires, and kingdoms before modern day===
Tabriz was chosen as the capital by several rulers commencing from the time of [[Atropates]]. It was the capital of the [[Ilkhanate]] (Mongol) dynasty since 1265. During the [[Ghazan]] Khan era, who came into power in 1295, the city reached its highest splendour. The later realm stretched from the [[Amu Darya]] in the East to the [[Egypt]] borders in the West and from the [[Caucasus]] in the North to the Indian Ocean in the South.<ref>Wood, John E. and Tucker, Ernest (2006) History and Historiography of Post-Mongol Central Asia and the Middle East, Otto Harrassowitz Gmbh & Co and KG Wiesbaden, p. 530.</ref> It was again the capital of Iran during the [[Qara Qoyunlu]] dynasty from 1375 to 1468 and then during the [[Ag Qoyunlu]] within 1468–1500 and it was capital of Iran in the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] period from 1501 [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1532-1555)|until their defeat in 1555]].<ref>Richard Tapper. "Shahsevan in Safavid Persia", ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', University of London, Vol. 37, No. 3, 1974, p. 324.

During the [[Persia under Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] dynasty, Tabriz was used as residence centre of Iranian Crown Prince (1794–1925).

=== Excavation sites ===
{{See also|Iron Age museum}}

In 2002, during a construction project at the north side of the [[Blue Mosque, Tabriz|Blue Mosque]] (Part of [[Silk Road]] Project), an ancient graveyard was revealed. This was kept secret until a construction worker alerted the authorities. Radiocarbon analysis by Allameh Tabatabai University has shown the background of the graves to be more than 3,800 years old. A museum of these excavations including the [[Blue Mosque, Tabriz|Blue Mosque]] was opened to the public in 2006.

The other excavation site is in Abbasi Street at the site of [[Rab'-e Rashidi]], which was the location for an academic institution since approximately 700 years ago. It was established in [[Ilkhanid]] period.

==Demographics==
=== Language ===
{{main|Azerbaijani language#Iranian Azerbaijani}}
{{See also|Old Azeri}}
The predominant language spoken in Tabriz is [[Azerbaijani language]] ([[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani people]] call it ''Turku'' (''تۆرکۆ'') or ''Turki'' (تۆرکی) language), which is a [[Turkic language]] mutually intelligible with modern [[Turkish dialects]]. The language has a strong Iranian [[Stratum (linguistics)|superstratum]] since it has been in close contact with the Persian language for many centuries. Similar to the other parts of Iran, the official language is [[Persian language|Persian]] and the most inhabitants have native or near-native knowledge of [[Persian language]], which is the major medium of education.<ref name="chap.sch.ir" /> Nevertheless, the [[Constitution of Iran|Iranian constitution]] respects the right to speak and have limited educational facilities in other native languages, including Azerbaijani. For the first time, an academic program on Azerbaijani language opened at the [[University of Tabriz]] in 1999.<ref>Rasmus Christian Elling, Minorities in Iran: Nationalism and Ethnicity after Khomeini, Palgrave 2013</ref> Other than Azerbaijani, there is a notable minority of [[Armenian language|Armenian]] speakers and a smaller minority of [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] speakers.

[[File:A Page from the only manuscript of Safina-ye Tabrizi.jpg|thumb|A page from the only manuscript of ''[[Safina-yi Tabriz]]''. It contains a Persian and a Pahlavi poem]]

It is believed that before the gradual increase and the dominance of Azerbaijani language in the area, other [[Iranian languages]] similar to Persian were spoken in [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]] and Tabriz.<ref>Jean During, "The Spirit of Sounds: The Unique Art of Ostad Elahi", Cornwall Books, 2003, p172:"Maraghi (15th century) mentions the Turkish and the Shirvani tambour, which had two strings tuned in second (which the Kurds and Lors call Farangi) and was quite popular among the inhabitants of Tabriz (a region which was not yet Turkish speaking at the time) "</ref><ref>R.

=== Religion ===
After being crowned at Tabriz in 1501, [[Ismail I|Shah Ismail I]] announced the [[Twelver]] branch of [[Shia Islam]] as the official religion of the [[Safavid Empire]]. As a result of this royal order, the mostly [[Sunni]] population of Tabriz was force converted to Shiism.<ref>John A A Boyle (Editor), Persia: History and Heritage, Routledge, 2011, p:38</ref><ref>Melissa L. Rossi (2008), ''What Every American Should Know about the Middle East'', Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0-452-28959-8}}, <q>Forced conversion in the Safavid Empire made Persia for the first time dominantly Shia and left a lasting mark: Persia, now Iran, has been dominantly Shia ever since, and for centuries the only country to have a ruling Shia majority.</q></ref> Currently, the majority of people are followers of Shia Islam.

The city has a visible [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] minority who follow [[Christianity]]. There used to be a small [[Jewish]] community, but most of them have moved to [[Tehran]].<ref name="chap.sch.ir" /> There is also a small, embattled community of the [[Baháʼí Faith]] in the city.<ref>Phyllis G.

== Geography ==

=== Topography ===
Tabriz is located in northwest of [[Iran]] in [[East Azerbaijan]] province between [[Eynali]] and [[Sahand]] mountains in a fertile area inshore of [[Aji Chay|Aji River]] and [[Quri River]].
The local area is earthquake-prone and during its history, the city has been devastated and rebuilt several times.

=== Climate ===
Tabriz has a [[Semi-arid climate|cold semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''BSk'', [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''BS'') bordering on a [[humid continental climate]] with hot summers ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dsa'', [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Dc''). The annual precipitation is around {{cvt|260|mm|in|0}}, a good deal of which falls as [[snow]] during the [[winter]] months and [[rain]] in [[spring (season)|spring]] and [[autumn]]. The city enjoys a mild and fine climate in spring and autumn, is hot and dry in summer, while snowy and cold in winter. The average annual temperature is {{cvt|13.1|°C}}. Cool winds blow from east to west, mostly in summer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldclimate.com/ |title=Climate data for Tabriz, 1963–1990 |access-date=2013-03-24 |archive-date=2011-02-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208173133/http://www.worldclimate.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Jean Chardin]], a French traveler, visited Tabriz during the Safavid era, noting the climate in Tabriz in his travel logs: "Cold weather exists for most of the year. Since the city is northerly, snow exists on the peaks of its mountains for nine months out of the year. The wind blows during mornings and nights, while rain showers form in all seasons except summer. The weather is relatively cloudy the entire year."<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Asbagh |first=Narmin Babazadeh |date=2019-12-01 |title=A Short Glimpse to the Urban Development of Tabriz during the History |url=https://ijcua.com/index.php/ijcua/article/view/113 |journal=Journal of Contemporary Urban Affairs |language=en |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=73–83 |doi=10.25034/ijcua.2018.4703 |issn=2475-6164|doi-access=free }}</ref>

=== Environment pollution ===
Air pollution is one of the major environmental issues in Tabriz. Air pollution is due to an increase of the number of cars commuting in the city and polluting industries such as thermal power plants, petrochemical complexes and the oil refinery in the west of the city. Air pollution levels increased continuously in the second half of the 20th century. With a mandate of national environmental codes by heavy industries, industrial air pollution has reduced in recent years. However, the air quality in the city is far from world norms for clean air.

An immediate environmental threat is the shrinkage and drying out of the [[Lake Urmia]] located in the outskirts of Western Tabriz. The lake has faced a grave crisis since the late 20th century. Water depth reduction, increasing water salinity to saturation level and the appearance of vast salt fields around the lake, are alarming indications of gradual total desiccation of a unique ecosystem. This occurred due to global warming and ever-increasing demands for inadequate freshwater sources in the basin. It is feared that in the near future low-lying clouds of airborne salt and minerals may hover over large areas around the lake, posing serious health hazards.<ref>H. Golabian, Macro-engineering Seawater in Unique Environments: Arid Lowlands and Water Bodies Rehabilitation, 2011, Springer, pp. 365–397</ref>

<blockquote><poem>[[Sahand]], o mountain of pure snow,
Descended from Heaven with [[Zoroaster]]
Fire in your heart, snow on your shoulders,
with storm of centuries,
And white hair of history on your chest ...</poem></blockquote>

[[Yadollah Maftun Amini]] (born in 1926)<ref>Gholam-Reza Sabri-Tabrizi, Iran: A Child's Story, a Man's Experience, 1989, Mainstream Publishing Company, P. 168</ref>

The city of Tabriz, historically located at the westernmost end of Iran’s trade route and situated along the [[Silk Road]], has long been a hub of commerce as well as culture and art. This strategic position facilitated both economic prosperity and the flourishing of cultural exchanges. In the [[modern era]], the establishment of Memorial School in the late 19th century, followed by the founding of the University of Tabriz, along with the presence of intellectual movements, further boosted the city’s cultural development.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=تبریز - دانشنامه ویکیدا |url=https://fa.wikida.ir/wiki/%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B2 |access-date=2024-09-10 |website=fa.wikida.ir |language=fa}}</ref>

Tabriz is also the birthplace of one of Iran’s most prominent schools of painting, known as the "Tabriz School." This artistic movement flourished during the periods of the [[Ilkhanate]], [[Jalayirids]], [[Qara Qoyunlu]], [[Aq Qoyunlu]], and [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid dynasties]], leaving a lasting impact on Iranian art.<ref name=":0" />

The proximity to [[Sahand]], a mountain in the south of the city, has been a source of inspiration for contemporary revolutionaries and poets alike. The power of this inspiring source, however, goes to much earlier times. Tabriz was a house for numerous Iranian writers, poets, and illumination movements. In old times the city notables supported poets and writers by organizing periodical meetings. Within its long history, it was a residence for many well known Iranian writers and poets. The list can start from the old-time [[Rumi]], [[Qatran Tabrizi|Qatran]], [[Khaqani]] to recent years [[Samad Behrangi]], [[Gholam-Hossein Sa'edi]], [[Parvin E'tesami]]. The prominent [[Iranian Azerbaijanis|Iranian Azerbaijani]] poet [[Mohammad-Hossein Shahriar]] was born in Tabriz. The culture, social values, language and music is a mixture of what exists in the rest of [[Iran]].

Tabriz also has a special place in [[Persian literature]], as the following sample of verses from some of [[List of Persian poets and authors|Iran's best poets and authors]] illustrates:

{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
<div class="center">
ساربانا بار بگشا ز اشتران<br />

Oh Sārbān, have the camels' cargo unloaded,<br />
This is Tabriz, the neighborhood of the beloved ones.<br />
―''[[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Molana]]''

عزیزی در اقصای تبریز بود<br />
که همواره بیدار و شبخیز بود

who was always alert and awake at night<br />

<div class="center">

The half loaf of bread and the water of Mehranrud [river] are enough!<br />
―''[[Khaqani Shirvani|Khaqani]]''

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Iran}}

A century-long autocratic nation-building policy of central governments in Iran has succeeded in cultural assimilation in the favour of a government-sanctioned culture.<ref>Ervand Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 2008, Cambridge University Press</ref> As a result, Tabriz, by the turn of the 20th century had nearly become devoid of its once characteristic cultural identity. Thanks to the more liberal policies of the [[Mohammad Khatami|Khatami era]] (1998–2006), a cultural renaissance took place and the local music was revitalized.

The traditional Azerbaijani music is divided into two distinct types, the music of "[[ashugh]]" and the "[[mugham]]". Mugham, despite its similarity to Persian classical music, was not common among Iranian Azerbaijanis. In recent years, however, mugham is gaining popularity among the educated middle-class young generation. For instance, Nasir Atapur, from Tabriz, was the laureate of Mugam contest 2007.

The ashugh music had survived in a mountainous region of [[Arasbaran|Qaradağ]] and presently is identified as the characteristic form of music in all Azerbaijan. The ashugh music, throughout its long history, had been associated with nomadic life in mountainous regions and used to be dismissed as back-country folklore. The recent identity renaissance of Azerbaijani speaking people has elevated the status of Ashughs as the guardians of national culture. The newfound unprecedented popularity and frequent concerts and performances in urban settings have resulted in rapid innovative developments aiming to enhance the urban-appealing aspects of these ashugh performances. The main factor for these developments was the opening of academic style music classes in Tabriz by master Ashugs, such as Aşiq Imran Heydəri.

[[Ashug]]s (Aşiq in Azerbaijani language stemmed from the Arabic word for lover) were travelling bards who sang and played saz, an eight or ten string plucking instrument in the form of a long-necked lute. Their roots can be traced back to at least the 7th century according to the Turkic epic Dede Korkut.<ref>G. Lewis (translator), The Book of Dede Korkut, Penguin Classics (1988)</ref> Naturally, the music has evolved in the course of the grand migration and ensuing feuds with the original inhabitants the acquired lands. Still, the essence of the original epics, i.e. metamorphic description of life in pastoral terms with direct reference to the mountainous landscape, persists to the present time. The characteristic aspect of the [[Ashugh]] music is its frequent allusions to a mountain with the intention of arousing an emotional state with a tone of mild melancholy in a listener. The first verses of a contemporary [[Ashug]] song, composed by Məhəmməd Araz, may well represent the essence of [[Ashugh]] music<ref>A. O.Senarslan, Women asiqs of Azerbaijan: tradition and transformation, PhD Thesis, University of Wisconsin-Madison (2008)</ref> may clarify the said statement.

''Bəlkə bu yerlərə birdə gəlmədim'' (I may not come to these mountains again)

''duman səlamət qal dağ səlamət qal'' (Farewell to the Mist and to the mountain)

''arxamca su səpir göydə bulutlar'' (Clouds sprinkle drops of rain)

''leysan səlamət qal yağ səlamət qal'' (Farewell to summer days, farewell to the rain)

Currently manufacturing industries in the city include manufacturing of machinery, vehicles, chemicals and [[petrochemical]] materials, [[Refining|refinery]], [[cement]], electrical and electronic equipment, home appliances, textiles and leather, nutrition and dairy, woodcraft, and pharmaceuticals.<ref name="chap.sch.ir" />

There are hundreds of industrial complexes in Tabriz's industrial area. Among them is the [[Iran Tractor Manufacturing Company|Iran Tractor Manufacturing Co (ITMCO)]] which is one of the biggest industrial complexes in the region. This complex alone has the highest foundry and forging capacity in the Middle East and it is the biggest tractor manufacturer in Iran with several production branches within Iran and other countries. Behind ITMCO there are several other industrial complexes including [[Mashin Sazi Tabriz]] Co, Iran Diesel Engine Manufacturing Co (IDEM), Pump Iran, Tabriz Petrochemical Complex, Tabriz Oil Refinery and a couple of industrial regions which include hundreds of small industries.

=== Handcrafts and ateliers ===
{{Main|Persian carpet}}
{{See also|Tabriz rug}}

Due to its distinct handicrafts and carpets Tabriz is selected as the world city of crafts and carpet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.farsnews.ir/newstext.php?nn=13940614000887 |title=تبریز شهر جهانی صنایع دستی و بافت فرش شد |publisher=[[Fars News Agency]] |date=5 September 2015 |access-date=5 September 2015}}</ref> Tabriz is the main centre for the production of the famous [[Persian carpet|Iranian Rugs]]. The distinctive durability of Tabriz's carpets and its unique designs made it a famous brand in the world's carpet markets. Tabrizi [[Carpet|rugs]] and [[carpet]]s usually have ivory backgrounds with blue, rose, and indigo motifs. They often feature symmetrical and balanced designs. They usually have a single medallion that is surrounded by vines and palmettos. One of the main quality characteristics of Tabriz [[Carpet|rugs]] is the weaving style, using specialities that guarantee the durability of the rug in comparison for example with [[Kashan]] [[Carpet|rugs]]. Therefore, most discussion surrounding Tabrizi rugs is on their high quality and durability instead of their traditional designs. However, Tabrizi rug patterns are not as easily identifiable as other cities' rug patterns as they are less distinctive, unlike Isfahan and Shiraz rugs, and most, if not clearly labeled Tabrizi, are assumed Tabrizi and met with labels like "probably Tabrizi."

Other than carpets, the city is famous for several other handicrafts including [[silver]]wares, [[wood]] engraving, [[pottery]] and [[ceramic]]s, Ghalamzani (Irania style of [[toreutics]]), Moarraq (Iranian style of [[Mosaic]]), Monabbat, [[embroider]].
