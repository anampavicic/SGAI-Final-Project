'''Kitwe''' is the third largest city in terms of infrastructure development (after Lusaka and Ndola) and second largest city in terms of size and population (after Lusaka) in [[Zambia]]. With a population of 517,543 (''2010 census provisional'') Kitwe is one of the most developed commercial and industrial areas in the nation, alongside [[Ndola]] and [[Lusaka]]. It has a complex of mines on its north-western and western edges.<ref name="Google">[http://earth.google.com Google Earth] accessed 2007.</ref>

Kitwe is located in the [[Copperbelt Province]] and is made up of [[township]]s and [[Suburb|suburban areas]] including Parklands, Riverside, Buchi, Chimwemwe, Kwacha, [[Nkana]] East, [[Nkana]] West, Garneton, Ndeke, Miseshi, Wusakile, Mindolo, Chachacha and Race Course, to mention a few.<ref name="ITM"/> The city is sometimes referred to as '''Kitwe-Nkana'''. Nkana is derived from the name of Senior Chief Nkana of the Lamba speaking people of the Copperbelt Province. His area covers the towns of Kitwe, [[Mufulira]], [[Kalulushi]] and [[Chambishi]].

Kitwe has both private and public schools which include Lechwe School, Mpelembe Secondary School, [[Kitwe Boys Secondary School]], Parklands Secondary School, Mukuba Secondary School, Nkana Trust School and Helen Kaunda Secondary School.{{Relevant?|date=August 2024}} It is also home to Zambia's second highest learning institution, namely [[Copperbelt University|The Copperbelt University]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Copperbelt University |url=https://www.cbu.ac.zm/ |access-date=2022-07-19 |website=www.cbu.ac.zm |language=en}}</ref>

==History==
Kitwe was founded in 1936 in north-central Zambia as the railway was being built by [[Cecil Rhodes]]' company. It was first established as an adjunct, non-mining-related but supportive part of an expanding copper-mining centre at [[Nkana]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} The expanding copper mines at Nkana made it the dominant centre in the region and Kitwe started building up its size and significance over the years, finally surpassing Nkana as the main centre. The [[Rhodesia Railways]] main line reached the town in 1937, providing passenger services as far south as [[Bulawayo]] in today's Zimbabwe, with connections to [[Cape Town]] in today's South Africa. The line was extended into [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo]], and from there eventually linked to the [[Benguela Railway]] to the Atlantic port of [[Lobito]] in Angola, which used to take some of Zambia's copper exports.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

With the upsurge of copper prices in the 1950s Kitwe developed from a small township to the second largest city in Zambia, obtaining city status in 1966. It then developed as an industrial and commercial area and later an important agricultural area. The good central position of the city in the Copperbelt area made it the most popular choice for industrial developers even today in the 2020s.{{Cn|date=February 2024}}

==Mining==
{{Main|Mining in Zambia}}
Kitwe is the base for a number of mining operations including the [[Mopani Copper Mines]]. Kitwe has rich
copper, cobalt and emerald deposits among other minerals. It is home to Mopani Copper Mine's Nkana Cobalt Plant, 
one of Africa's largest mines. The mine is located 1&nbsp;km south west of the Kitwe city centre. 
Nkana cobalt mine is the deepest mine on the Zambian Copperbelt. It has two shafts below 1,300
meters and three open pits. The plant treats cobalt concentrates to produce high purity cobalt metal.
At Nkana, copper and cobalt ore is produced from five sources: four underground mines namely,
Mindola North Shaft, Mindola Sub Vertical Shaft, Central Shaft, South Ore Body (SOB) Shaft and
open pits dotted across the Nkana Oxide Cap.

The following is a list of Mining Companies in Kitwe (as of 2019),
*Mopani Copper Mines Nkana Cobalt Plant
*Konkola Copper Mines Copper Refining Plant
*EC Mining
*Grizzly Mining
*Kagem Mining Ltd
*African Mining Consultants
*Sandvik Mining
*AAC Mining Executors Ltd

==Communications==
===Railway===
Kitwe lies at the end of [[Zambia Railways]] passenger services from [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]], [[Lusaka]] and [[Ndola]],<ref>[http://www.seat61.com/Zambia.htm#Livingstone%20-%20Lusaka ''Seat61 website''] retrieved 2 June 2007, says information was correct in November 2006.</ref> but freight lines continue to the mining towns to the north-west ([[Chingola]] and [[Chililabombwe]]) and north ([[Mufulira]]).

===Road===
The main highway through the Copperbelt (the [[T3 road (Zambia)|T3 highway]]) runs south-east to north-west through the city, to [[Ndola]] (as a dual carriageway) in the south-east, and to [[Chingola]] (as a dual carriageway) and [[Chililabombwe]] in the north-west. A laterite road (the [[M7 Road (Copperbelt)|M7 road]]) goes west to [[Kalulushi]] and [[Kasempa]]. The [[M4 road (Zambia)|M4 road]] connects Sabina (just north-west of Kitwe) with [[Mufulira]] and the [[Congo Pedicle]] to the north.<ref name="ITM">Terracarta/International Travel Maps, Vancouver Canada: "Zambia, 2nd edition", 2000</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite web |title=Roads and Road Traffic Act {{!}} National Assembly of Zambia |url=https://www.parliament.gov.zm/node/1492 |access-date=2022-06-27 |website=www.parliament.gov.zm}}</ref>

===Airport===
[[Southdowns Airport]] lies about 12&nbsp;km south-west of the town but does not receive any scheduled services. As of April 2024, there are plans by the government of Zambia to transform Southdowns Airport into a military base, therefore transferring the management responsibilities from Zambia Airports Corporation Limited to the [[Zambian Air Force]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-04-14 |title=Cabinet announces transfer of Southdowns, Mbala airports to Zambia Air Force {{!}} Zambia Monitor |url=https://www.zambiamonitor.com/cabinet-announces-transfer-of-southdowns-mbala-airports-to-zambia-air-force/ |access-date=2024-05-08 |language=en-US}}</ref>

[[Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe International Airport|Ndola Airport]] is 50&nbsp;km to the south-east and services regular commercial flights from [[Lusaka]], [[Solwezi]], [[Addis Ababa]], [[Nairobi]], and [[Johannesburg]].

==Education==
{{Update|part=section|date=February 2024}}

===Schools===
A student and teacher exchange programme was introduced in 1999 with teacher exchange visits by [[Kingsmead School, Wiveliscombe|Kingsmead Community School]] in [[Wiveliscombe]], England with two Kitwe schools – Helen Kaunda High School and Mukuba High School. This started a series of partnerships between Zambian schools such as Chamboli, Mukuba, Ndeke Secondary, Ndeke Basic, Kitwe Boys, Kitwe Basic, Wesely Nyerenda, Fatima, Nkana High, etc. and UK schools, and there are now over 30 such school partnerships. Students from Kingsmead paid a visit to the Kitwe schools in 2005.<ref>[http://www.times.co.zm/news/viewnews.cgi?category=8&id=1123874431 "Zambia/UK student partnerships fostering multi-cultural relations"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051112165259/http://www.times.co.zm/news/viewnews.cgi?category=8&id=1123874431 |date=12 November 2005 }}, Gethsemane Mwizabi, [[Times of Zambia]], 2005</ref> Kitwe has a number of private schools, six being:

'''Lechwe School''' is one of the biggest schools in the city. An international school, it provides pre-school, primary, secondary, and advanced level teaching following a Cambridge curriculum. Lechwe school is a multi-cultural school, hence there is not much religious teaching but a large number of subject options in secondary and advanced level schooling.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} The school is known for having a good disciplinary policy and a number of extracurricular activities like chess, table tennis, volleyball, basketball, tennis, squash, rugby, hockey, football, cricket, athletics, swimming, softball, netball, handball, baseball, rounders, a Duke of Edinburgh program, and martial arts.

Eppa Tembo, a chess player, represented Zambia in 2008 World Championship.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

'''Mpelembe Secondary School''' is one of the biggest secondary schools in the city and a preeminent secondary school. It offers Zambian Standard syllabus and Cambridge curriculum. Being one of the top 10 best schools in Zambia, Mpelembe has a highly selective admissions at both eighth and tenth grade entry levels. Each year, there are thousands of applicants and only about one hundred and fifty students are enrolled. Mpelembe has an A level program under the Cambridge Local Examination Syndicate.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} Students who meet the grades go on to study at universities in the UK, US, Canada, South Africa and other developed countries. The most popular Universities for Mpelembe Students are University of Manchester, Birmingham, UMIST, Imperial college, Leeds University. Camborne School of Mines is the default college for Mining Engineering students. Mpelembe has produced some of the best students at grade nine and twelve levels with some among the top two in the nation. The former students have an association known as MESA [Mpelembe Ex-Students Association] which has been sponsoring deserving students to do grade 10–12 at the school. Ex-Mpelembe students are scattered all over the world working for various organisations ranging from Government departments to Google.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

'''Nkana Trust School''' is a trust school that provides pre-school, primary, and secondary school education. It offers the Zambian syllabus. Nkana Trust School is known for having one of the best sports and education facilities in the city and the country as a whole. Nkana trust school students produce best results in Grade 7 composite final examinations and Grade 10 and 12 final examinations. Nkana trust formally called Kitana trust has produced notable names such as Zambia's king of comedy and film director Bob Nkosha.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

'''Elim Primary School''' is a small school that provides pre-school and primary school following a Zambian Standard syllabus (mainly Macmillan and Longman), and provides the basic facilities in swimming and athletics four times a week. Despite its small size, it produces one of the nation's best Grade 7 composite examination.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}
[[File:St John Convent School Kitwe.jpg|thumb|350px|St John's Convent Catholic School in Kitwe.]]
'''St. Johns Convent School''' is one of the largest Catholic schools in the province, a convent school that provides pre-school, primary and secondary teaching following a Zambian syllabus and providing some facilities such as athletics, swimming, basketball, rugby, football, chess, and softball. The school was founded and is run by the Sisters of John the Baptist (the [[Sisters of St. John the Baptist|Baptist]]ines).{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

'''Kawama Pentecostal Holiness School''' (not to be confused with Kawama School in Kamitondo) is currently under construction by [[Cranleigh School]] in partnership with a UK charity, [[Beyond Ourselves]]. The school is located in the suburbs of Kitwe in the deprived area of Kawama. In August 2011, 17 past and present students of [[Cranleigh School]] spent two weeks laying the blocks of the 4 classroom building located adjacent to the current church building. Another [[Cranleigh School]] trip is planned for October 2011 with the aim of completing the school building and opening the new school to the 210 students (who currently all study in the single-room church building) in January 2012.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The construction work has been funded largely by the money raised in a Sponsored Walk held during the Summer of 2010 and marks the start of a long-term relationship between Cranleigh and Kawama School over the coming years. Cranleigh School is now working to develop the Child Sponsorship Programme at Kawama which will provide a salary for the staff (allowing them to complete their teaching qualifications) plus a lunch time meal and school uniform for every child. The feeding programme which provides a meal is particularly important as it not only provides employment for local women in the kitchen, but vitally it means that the children are receiving at least one square meal per day. In a region where the HIV/AIDS rate is very high, and many children are on ARV's (antiretroviral drugs), being adequately nourished is essential for this medication to work effectively.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Cranleigh School is now actively seeking to sponsor every child attending Kawama School. This is being achieved through direct appeals to parents, and through campaigns in each boarding house, who are using ingenious ways to raise the necessary funds.

Kitwe has a mining school, '''Konkola Trust School''', that trains miners in the copperbelt; and a flying club that trains pilots near the Showgrounds. The flying club is housed in the area that was occupied by the former Kitwe airport.

===Universities, Colleges and Institutes===
