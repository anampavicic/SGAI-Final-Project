==History==
The area Narita has been inhabited since the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period. Archaeologists have found [[stone tool]]s dating to some 30,000 years ago on the site of Narita Airport. Numerous [[shell midden]]s from the [[Jōmon period]], and hundreds of [[kofun|burial tumuli]] from the [[Kofun period]] have been found in numerous locations around Narita. Place names in the vicinity of Narita appear in the [[Nara period]] ''[[Man'yōshū]]'' (although the name “Narita” does not appear in written records until 1408). As Narita is located roughly equidistant from the [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[Tokyo Bay]], around a number of small rivers, it was a natural political and commercial center for the region, and gained importance as a pilgrimage destination with the foundation of the noted Buddhist temple of [[Narita-san|Shinsho-ji]] in 940 AD. During the [[Heian period]], the area was a center for the revolt of [[Taira Masakado]]. During the [[Edo period]], the area continued to prosper as part of the ''[[tenryō]]'' within [[Shimōsa Province]] under direct control of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].

After the [[Meiji Restoration]], the area was organized as a town under [[Inba District, Chiba|Inba District]] on April 1, 1889. Portions of the town were destroyed by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Strategic bombing|air raid]]s in February and May, 1945. On  March 31, 1954, Narita gained city status through merger with the neighboring villages of Habu, Nakago, Kuzumi, Toyosumi, Toyama, and Kozu. Growth in the area began in earnest in 1966, when Prime Minister [[Eisaku Satō]] laid out the plan for [[Narita International Airport]]. The development of the airport and accompanying access to central Tokyo led to widespread residential, commercial and industrial development in the city. However, construction of the airport was widely opposed, and violent demonstrations occurred through the end of the 1960s and early 1970s, which delayed the opening of the airport until May 20, 1978.

On March 27, 2006, the towns of [[Shimofusa, Chiba|Shimofusa]] and [[Taiei, Chiba|Taiei]] (both from [[Katori District, Chiba|Katori District]]) were merged into Narita.

==Government==
Narita has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 30 members. Narita contributes two members to the Chiba Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Chiba 10th district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Areas==
===Central Narita===
Central Narita is roughly defined as the area between [[Narita Station]], [[Keisei Narita Station]] and the [[Narita-san]] Temple. The main road in central Narita is {{Nihongo|Omotesandō|表参道}}, which is lined with about 150 small shops and has been extensively renovated in recent years.

===Narita New Town===
Narita New Town is a [[Planned community|planned residential area]] to the west of [[Narita Station]]. It has 16,000 homes with a total population of 60,000. The area was designed in 1968 based on the new towns surrounding London in the UK, and now houses most of the city's population. Many residents of the area are airport or airline workers: the area houses corporate housing and dormitories for [[Japan Airlines]], [[All Nippon Airways]], the [[Japan Civil Aviation Bureau]] and [[Japan Customs]]. There are also several [[Urban Renaissance Agency]] and other government-subsidized housing projects in the area.

===Kōzunomori===
[[Kōzunomori]] is a suburban area of Narita located south of the New Town, about 4 minutes by train from Keisei Narita Station. It has a population of about 12,000. [[Kōzunomori Station]] is flanked by a large [[Your Elm]] department store.

===Airport and farm areas===
[[Narita International Airport]] is located on the east side of Narita in a historically agricultural area called {{Nihongo|Sanrizuka|三里塚}}. The construction and later expansion of the airport led to intense [[Sanrizuka Struggle|civil unrest]] among Sanrizuka residents (see [[Narita International Airport#History|Narita International Airport's history]]). Although land expropriation and poorer farming conditions due to the airport's construction have caused Narita's farming population to drop two-thirds from pre-airport levels, the area immediately surrounding the airport remains lightly populated by farmers.

===Industrial areas===
There are two main industrial zones in Narita: {{nihongo|Nogedaira|野毛平}} and {{nihongo|Toyosumi|豊住}}. Both zones were laid out in the 1960s to take advantage of Narita Airport and the ability to quickly import and export goods by air. An aircraft part repair plant operated by JAL ([[Japan Airlines]]) and [[Pratt & Whitney]], called [[Japan Turbine Technologies]], is located in the Taiei industrial estate.

==Economy==
Although Narita's economy was historically focused on agriculture, the opening of [[Narita International Airport]] refocused the local economy on transportation, logistics and tourism. Most of the airport property is located within Narita City, but many airport hotels and airport-related logistics facilities are in the neighboring towns of Shibayama and Tomisato.

[[Prologis]], [[FedEx Express]], [[Sagawa Express]] and several other large logistics firms have major shipping centers in the city.
