==History==
[[File:Alternative Ermine Street.JPG|right|thumb|[[Ermine Street]]'s alternative route: [[Eboracum]] ([[York]]) to Lagecium ([[Castleford]]), 21 [[Roman mile|miles]], to Danum (Doncaster), 16 miles, to Agelocum ([[Littleborough, Nottinghamshire|Littleborough]]), 21 miles, to [[Lindum Colonia|Lindum]] ([[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]]), 13 miles. A spur connected Danum with [[Calcaria]] (near [[Tadcaster]]).]]

===Roman===
Possibly inhabited earlier, Doncaster grew up on the site of a [[Roman fort]] of the 1st century CE, at a crossing of the [[River Don, South Yorkshire|River Don]]. The 2nd-century [[Antonine Itinerary]] and [[Roman withdrawal from Britain|early-5th-century]] ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'' (''Register of Dignitaries'') called the fort '''{{lang|la|Danum}}'''. The first section of road to the Doncaster fort had probably been built since the early 50s, while a route through the north [[Derbyshire]] hills was opened in the later 1st century, possibly by Governor [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Gn. Julius Agricola]] in the late 70s. Doncaster provided an alternative land route between [[Lindum Colonia|Lincoln]] and [[Eboracum|York]], while the main route [[Ermine Street]] involved parties breaking up to cross the [[Humber]] in boats. As this was not always practical, the Romans saw Doncaster as an important staging post. The [[Roman road]] appears on two routes recorded in the [[Antonine Itinerary]]. The itinerary includes the same section of road between Lincoln and York and lists three stations between these two [[Roman colonia|coloniae]]. Routes 7 and 8 (''{{lang|la|Iter}}&nbsp;VII & VIII'') are entitled "the route from York to [[Londinium|London]]".

Several areas of intense archaeological interest have been identified in the town, although many such as [[St Sepulchre Gate]] remain hidden under buildings. The Roman fort is thought to have lain on the site now taken by [[St George's Minster, Doncaster|St George's Minster]], beside the [[River Don, South Yorkshire|River Don]]. The Doncaster garrison units are named in a ''Register'' produced near the [[Roman withdrawal from Britain|end of Roman rule in Britain]]: it was the home of the Crispinian Horse, presumably named after the tribes living near [[Crispiana]] in [[Pannonia Superior]] (near present-day [[Zirc]] in western [[Hungary]]), but possibly after [[Crispus]], son of [[Constantine the Great]], who was headquartered there while his father was based in nearby [[Eboracum|York]]. The ''Register'' names the unit as under the command of the "[[Dux Britanniarum|Duke of the Britons]]".

In 1971 the [[Danum shield]], a rectangular Roman shield dating to the 1st or 2nd century CE, was recovered from the site of the Danum fort.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Buckland |first1=Paul |title=A First-Century Shield from Doncaster, Yorkshire |journal=Britannia |date=1978 |volume=9 |pages=247–269 |doi=10.2307/525941 |jstor=525941 |s2cid=162342730 |issn=0068-113X}}</ref>

An inscribed altar, dedicated to the [[Matres]] by Marcus Nantonius Orbiotalus, was found at St Sepulchre Gate in 1781.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://romaninscriptionsofbritain.org/inscriptions/618 |title=RIB 618.

It was mentioned in the 1003 [[Will (law)|will]] of [[Wulfric Spott]]. Shortly after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]], [[Nigel Fossard]] refortified the town and built [[Conisbrough Castle]]. By the time of [[Domesday Book]], [[Hexthorpe]] in the [[Hundred (county division)|wapentake]] of [[Strafforth and Tickhill|Strafforth]] was said to have a church and two [[Mill (grinding)|mills]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://opendomesday.org/place/SE5703/doncaster/ |title=Open Domesday online: Hexthorpe (at Doncaster) |access-date=9 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110113703/http://opendomesday.org/place/SE5703/doncaster/ |archive-date=10 November 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> The historian David Hey says these facilities represent the settlement at Doncaster.

With the 13th century, Doncaster matured into a busy town. In 1194 [[Richard I of England|King Richard I]] granted it national recognition with a [[town charter]]. It suffered a disastrous fire in 1204, from which it slowly recovered. At the time, buildings were built of wood, and open fireplaces used for cooking and heating.

[[File:St Mary Magdalene Doncaster.jpg|thumb|Norman church of St Mary Magdalene, at demolition in 1846]]
In 1248, a charter was granted for [[Doncaster Market]] to be held in the area surrounding the Church of St Mary Magdalene, which was built in Norman times. In the 16th century, the church was adapted for use as the [[town hall]]. It was finally demolished in 1846.<ref name="hey" /> Some 750 years on, the market continues to operate, with busy traders located under cover, at the 19th-century [[Doncaster Corn Exchange]] building (1873).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://public-art.shu.ac.uk/pmsa/doncaster/00000046.htm |title=Doncaster Metropolitan Borough |publisher=Sheffield Hallam University |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104200816/http://public-art.shu.ac.uk/pmsa/doncaster/00000046.htm |archive-date=4 January 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The Corn Exchange was much rebuilt in 1994 after a major fire.<ref>{{cite web |title=Doncaster Market Place: Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Proposals |url=https://dmbcwebstolive01.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/Planning/Documents/Built%20Environment/Conservation/Doncaster%20Market%20Place/Doncaster%20Market%20Place%20Conservation%20Area%20(page%201%20-%2049).pdf |website=Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council |access-date=8 December 2021 |archive-date=8 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211208231523/https://dmbcwebstolive01.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/Planning/Documents/Built%20Environment/Conservation/Doncaster%20Market%20Place/Doncaster%20Market%20Place%20Conservation%20Area%20(page%201%20-%2049).pdf |url-status=live}}</ref>

During the 14th century, numerous friars arrived in Doncaster who were known for their religious enthusiasm and preaching. In 1307 the [[Franciscan]] friars ([[Greyfriar]]s) arrived, as did [[Carmelites]] (Whitefriars) in the mid-14th century. Other major medieval features included the Hospital of St Nicholas and the [[leper colony]] of the Hospital of St James, a [[moot hall]], a [[grammar school]] and a five-arched stone town bridge with a chapel dedicated to Our Lady of the Bridge. By 1334, Doncaster was the wealthiest town in southern Yorkshire and the sixth in Yorkshire as a whole, even boasting its own banker. By 1379, it was recovering from the [[Black Death]], which had reduced its population to 1,500. In October 1536, the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]] ended in Doncaster. This rebellion led by the lawyer [[Robert Aske (political leader)|Robert Aske]] commanded 40,000 Yorkshire people against Henry VIII, in protest at the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. Many of Doncaster's streets are named with the suffix "-gate", after the [[old Danish]] word ''gata'', meaning street. In medieval times, craftsmen or tradesmen with similar skills tended to live in the same street. Baxter is an ancient word for baker: Baxtergate was the bakers' street. Historians believe that Frenchgate may be named after French-speaking [[Normans]] who settled there.

The medieval township is known to have been protected by earthen ramparts and ditches, with four substantial gates as entrances to the town. These were located at Hall Gate, St Mary's Bridge (old), St Sepulchre Gate and Sunny Bar. Today the gates at Sunny Bar are commemorated by huge "Boar Gates"; similarly, the entrance to St Sepulchre Gate is commemorated by white marble "Roman Gates". The boundary of the town mainly extended from the Don along a route known now Market Road, Silver Street, Cleveland Street and Printing Office Street.

===Modern===

Access to the town was restricted and some officeholders secured charters to collect tolls. In 1605, [[James I of England|King James I]] granted to William [[Levett]] of Doncaster, brother of [[York]] merchant [[Percival Levett]], the right to levy tolls at Friar's and St Mary's bridges.<ref name="maine">{{cite web |url=http://archive.org/details/bub_gb_yETLcuNxk18C |title=Collections of the Maine Historical Society |date=20 May 1890 |publisher=The Society |via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Having served as mayors and aldermen of Doncaster, the Levetts probably believed they could control a monopoly. In 1618 the family began enforcing it, but by 1628 the populace revolted. Capt. [[Christopher Levett]], Percival's son, petitioned Parliament to enforce the tolls, but Parliament disagreed, calling them "a grievance to the subjects, both in creation and execution," and axing the Levett monopoly.<ref name="maine" /> Doncaster's Levet Road is named after the family, as are nearby hamlets of [[Hooton Levitt]] and the largely abandoned [[Levitt Hagg]], where much of the town's early limestone was quarried.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, Doncaster continued to expand, but it suffered several outbreaks of plague between 1562 and 1606. Each struck down significant numbers of victims.

During the [[First English Civil War]], [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] marched by [[Bridgnorth]], [[Lichfield]] and [[Ashbourne, Derbyshire|Ashbourne]] to Doncaster, where on 18 August 1645 he was met by numbers of [[Yorkshire]] gentlemen who had rallied to his cause. On 2 May 1664, Doncaster was rewarded with the title of Free Borough as a way for the King (Charles I's son, [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]) to express gratitude for the allegiance.

Doncaster was connected to the rail network in 1848 and a plant and carriage works for [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] was constructed in the town in 1853.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=2562}}The [[Doncaster Carr rail depot]] was opened in 1876.<ref>[[Doncaster Carr rail depot#dc1927|Doncaster Carr Sheds]], LNER Magazine 1927, p.387</ref>

The area to the east of Doncaster started developing settlements where coal miners lived from the 1850s onwards, exploiting coal near [[Barnsley]]. One such settlement is Deneby.<ref name=":0">{{cite book |last=Waller |first=Symeon Mark |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B009ZITNBU/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1 |title=The Big Book of Doncaster History |date=30 October 2012 |publisher=Doncaster History Publishing |editor-last=Publishing |editor-first=Doncaster History |page=1697 |access-date=16 January 2022 |archive-date=7 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230407143613/https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B009ZITNBU/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Doncaster and surrounding settlements became part of the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] in 1899. Under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] it was drawn into a new [[metropolitan borough]] in 1974 and became part of the new county of South Yorkshire.

==Governance and politics==
===National politics===
Doncaster is represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by three [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Members of Parliament]] (MPs). [[Sally Jameson]] represents [[Doncaster Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Doncaster Central]], [[Ed Miliband]], the former [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party leader]], represents [[Doncaster North (UK Parliament constituency)|Doncaster North]], and [[Lee Pitcher]] represents the [[Doncaster East and the Isle of Axholme (UK Parliament constituency)|Doncaster East and the Isle of Axholme]]. 

[[2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies|From 2023]], the Don Valley constituency will be renamed [[Doncaster East and the Isle of Axholme (UK Parliament constituency)|Doncaster East and the Isle of Axholme]], and will cover part of [[North Lincolnshire]]. A new [[Rawmarsh and Conisbrough (UK Parliament constituency)|Rawmarsh and Conisbrough]] constituency will be created covering the south-western suburbs of Doncaster and parts of Rotherham. Doncaster Central and Doncaster North will see minor boundary changes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boundarycommissionforengland.independent.gov.uk/2023-review/2023-review-volume-three-maps/page/10/ |title=The 2023 Review of Parliamentary Constituency Boundaries in England – Volume three: Maps |publisher=Boundary Commission for England |access-date=15 July 2023 |archive-date=15 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230715133751/https://boundarycommissionforengland.independent.gov.uk/2023-review/2023-review-volume-three-maps/page/10/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

In September 2014, [[UKIP]] held an annual party conference at [[Doncaster Racecourse]]. UKIP party leader [[Nigel Farage]] claimed that by holding the conference in Doncaster, UKIP were "now parking our tanks on the Labour Party's lawn", referring to [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] leader [[Ed Miliband]]'s [[Doncaster North (UK Parliament constituency)|Doncaster North]] constituency. Shortly afterwards in the seat, at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], UKIP won 8,928 votes to Labour's 20,708.

===Local politics===
Doncaster forms part of the [[South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority|South Yorkshire Combined Authority]], which elects a [[Mayor of South Yorkshire|mayor]] every four years.

Additionally, the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster is one of twelve districts in the United Kingdom to have a [[directly elected mayors in England and Wales|directly elected mayor]], currently [[Ros Jones]], who was re-elected in 2021.

===City status===
The local authority applied several times, unsuccessfully, for [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]]. Its borough population of greater than 300,000 is larger than that of many cities' such as [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Southampton]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. On 28 October 2021, Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council announced its bid for Doncaster City for the Queen's [[Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Platinum Jubilee]]. This has been supported by the Doncaster Labour Group and the Doncaster Conservative Association. All three MPs for Doncaster expressed support for city status, with [[Don Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Don Valley]]'s [[Nick Fletcher (politician)|Nick Fletcher]] speaking for it in Parliament.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/i/status/1463845236426391553 |title=Nick Fletcher MP's Speech on Doncaster City Status |work=Nick Fletcher MP |access-date=25 November 2021 |archive-date=7 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230407143625/https://twitter.com/i/status/1463845236426391553 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Alongside seven other areas, Doncaster was announced to have succeeded in its bid to gain city status on 20 May 2022 as part of the [[Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II]]. The city status applies to the whole metropolitan borough rather than just the built up area of Doncaster. Doncaster formally received the [[Letters Patent (United Kingdom)|letters patent]] and became a city when a ceremony took place on 9 November 2022 as part of a royal visit.<ref name="royal visit" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Platinum Jubilee: Eight new cities created in Queen's honour |last=O'Connor |first=Mary |date=20 May 2022 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61505857 |website=BBC News |access-date=20 May 2022 |archive-date=19 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220519233708/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61505857 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Doncaster City Status Naming |url=https://www.visitdoncaster.com/news/doncaster-city-status-naming/ |access-date=8 September 2022 |archive-date=8 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220908004657/https://www.visitdoncaster.com/news/doncaster-city-status-naming/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Administrative history===
Doncaster was an [[ancient parish]], which was subdivided into six [[Township (England)|townships]]: [[Balby]] with [[Hexthorpe]], Langthwaite with [[Tilts]], [[Long Sandall]], [[Loversall]], [[Wheatley, South Yorkshire|Wheatley]] and a Doncaster township covering the central part of the parish, including the town. Such townships were also made [[civil parish]]es in 1866.<ref>{{cite web |title=Doncaster Ancient Parish / Civil Parish / Township |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10417442 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=13 March 2024 |archive-date=13 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240313081113/https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10417442 |url-status=live}}</ref> Doncaster was also an [[ancient borough]], with its earliest known charter dating from 1194.<ref>{{cite web |title=Doncaster Borough Charter of King Richard I, 2 May 1194 |url=https://library.doncaster.gov.uk/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=e1005682-ad9b-4fff-ab0d-e32fcd7a4d1e&groupId=10158 |website=Doncaster Library |access-date=13 March 2024 |archive-date=13 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240313075611/https://library.doncaster.gov.uk/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=e1005682-ad9b-4fff-ab0d-e32fcd7a4d1e&groupId=10158 |url-status=live}}</ref> The borough just covered the Doncaster township, although it exerted some authority over a surrounding rural area known as the soke.<ref>{{cite book |title=Report of the Commissioners Appointed to Inquire into the Municipal Corporations in England and Wales: Appendix 3 |date=1835 |page=1493 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N3FTAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1493 |access-date=13 March 2024 |archive-date=25 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240325063559/https://books.google.com/books?id=N3FTAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1493 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The borough was reformed to become a [[municipal borough]] in 1836 under the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country. The borough boundaries were enlarged several times, notably in 1914 when it absorbed Balby with Hexthorpe and Wheatley. By 1927 the borough was considered large enough to run its own county-level services, and so it was made a [[county borough]], independent from [[West Riding County Council]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Doncaster Municipal Borough / County Borough |url=https://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10136283&c_id= |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=13 March 2024 |archive-date=13 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240313081114/https://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10136283&c_id= |url-status=live}}</ref>

The county borough was abolished in 1974 and replaced by the larger [[Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster]], which also took in the abolished [[Urban district (England and Wales)|urban district]]s of [[Adwick le Street]], [[Bentley with Arksey]], [[Conisbrough Urban District|Conisbrough]], [[Mexborough]], [[Tickhill]], the [[rural district]]s of [[Doncaster Rural District|Doncaster]] and [[Thorne Rural District|Thorne]], and (from Nottinghamshire) the parish of [[Finningley]] and part of the parish of [[Harworth]] (the latter being added to the parish of [[Bawtry]]).<ref>{{cite legislation UK |type=act |act=Local Government Act 1972 |year=1972 |chapter=70 |access-date=10 March 2024}}</ref> The borough was raised to city status in 2022.

Doncaster is the second largest settlement in South Yorkshire and the largest metropolitan district in England by [[List of English districts by area|area]]. It expanded dramatically in population with the development of coal mining. Closure of coal mines in the 1970s and early 1980s caused economic difficulties; the town then developed its [[service industry]], drawing on the good communication links with the rest of the UK.

The Doncaster skyline is overlooked by the minster in the middle of the city. The [[Frenchgate Shopping Centre]] is in a similar position in the skyline, along with the Doncaster College Hub building.

After the old Doncaster College and surrounding buildings were demolished, the new [[Doncaster Civic Office]] designed by Cartwright Pickard was built for [[Doncaster Council]] at a cost of £20 million and completed in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ajbuildingslibrary.co.uk/projects/display/id/6892 |title=Doncaster Civic Office |publisher=AJ Buildings Library |access-date=9 February 2021 |archive-date=9 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210209152535/https://www.ajbuildingslibrary.co.uk/projects/display/id/6892 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Topography===
Doncaster lies in a [[upland and lowland|lowland]] valley in southern Yorkshire. To the west are low rolling hills eventually reaching the [[Pennines]]. To the east are the low-lying [[Isle of Axholme]] and [[Humberhead Levels]]. The south is relatively low-lying, with a large forested area including [[Sherwood Forest]] in [[Nottinghamshire]]. The [[Vale of York]] lies to the north. The floodplains of the River Don lie to Doncaster's north-east; this area is regularly flooded, notably in 2007 and 2019.

===Conservation===
====Nature reserves====
[[Thorne and Hatfield Moors]], east of Doncaster, is the largest area of low-lying peat bog in the United Kingdom. It is protected as a national nature reserve.

[[Potteric Carr]], including [[Potteric Carr Nature Reserve]], lies to the south.

====Green belt====
{{further|South and West Yorkshire Green Belt}}
Doncaster is within a [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] that extends into the surrounding counties. First defined in 1966,<ref name="belt1" /> the policy is controlled throughout the town by the [[local planning authority]], Doncaster Council. It reduces [[urban sprawl]], prevent areas in the conurbation from further convergence, protects outlying communities, encourages [[brownfield]] reuse, and protects nearby countryside by restricting development in the designated areas and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.<ref name="belt1">{{cite web |last1=Council |first1=Doncaster |title=Green Belt review – Doncaster Council |url=http://www.doncaster.gov.uk/services/planning/green-belt-review |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |access-date=4 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322143508/http://www.doncaster.gov.uk/services/planning/green-belt-review |archive-date=22 March 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

It surrounds the side of the urban area west of the East Coast Line, preventing suburbs such as [[Sprotbrough]], [[New Edlington]], [[Old Edlington]], [[Scawsby]] and [[Rossington|New Rossington]] merging. As a result, open rural land can be very close to the town centre at some points (for example the wide undeveloped valley of the River Don is adjacent to the town centre), while at other points the urban sprawl rolls on for up to five miles. Another aim of the green belt is to encourage recreation and leisure interests,<ref name="belt1" /> with rural landscape features, greenfield areas and facilities including the River Don and valley west of Hexthorpe; Hexthorpe Park; [[Cusworth Hall]], museum and country park; Potteric Carr and Huxter Well Marsh; and the [[Trans Pennine Trail]].

===Climate===
Doncaster has a [[maritime climate]] lacking extreme temperatures, like much of the British Isles. Its low elevation in the Don Valley, in the lee of the Pennines, and inland from the North Sea, mean daytime summer temperatures are no lower than parts of South East England, despite the more northerly location. The nearest weather station is RAF Finningley, now known as [[Doncaster Sheffield Airport]], about {{cvt|5.5|mi|km}} to the south-east of Doncaster city centre and at a similar elevation.

The Doncaster area is about as far north as the {{cvt|21.5|C|F}} average July/August maximum temperature isotherm reaches – Indeed, the August 1990 record high of {{cvt|35.5|C|F}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=14&year=1990&indexid=TXx&stationid=2119 |title=August 1990 maximum |access-date=27 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331161716/http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=14&year=1990&indexid=TXx&stationid=2119 |archive-date=31 March 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> is the most northerly temperature above {{cvt|35|C|F}} in the British Isles.

The lowest known temperature is {{cvt|-13.5|C|F}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=18&year=1981&indexid=TNn&stationid=2119 |title=1981 Minimum |access-date=27 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331161727/http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=18&year=1981&indexid=TNn&stationid=2119 |archive-date=31 March 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> set during December 1981. Online records only go back to 1960, and lower temperatures may have been recorded earlier. During the 1971–2000 period, an average of 51.9 nights of the year recorded an air frost.

Typically 106.9 days<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/calcdetail.php?seasonid=0&periodid=1971-2000&indexid=RR1&stationid=2119 |title=1971–2000 Wetdays |access-date=27 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331161734/http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/calcdetail.php?seasonid=0&periodid=1971-2000&indexid=RR1&stationid=2119 |archive-date=31 March 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> of the year report 1 mm or more of rainfall.

==Economy==
[[File:Panorama of Market Place, Doncaster.jpg|thumb|Doncaster Market Place Panoramic]]
[[File:Doncaster Town Center.JPG|thumb|The High Street in Doncaster city centre]]
Doncaster emerged as an industrial centre in the late 18th to 20th centuries. Its communications, particularly its waterways, meant that it became extremely busy and experienced migration to its centre. Underneath Doncaster lies a huge natural resource by way of deep seam coal.

===Distribution centres===
Doncaster's proximity to major urban centres and motorway/rail infrastructure gives it a number of major distribution centres, including the 420-acre [[Doncaster International Railport]], which dispatches goods to Europe. It also has large warehousing and logistic capabilities for retailers such as [[Next (clothing)|Next]], [[Tesco]], [[IKEA]], [[Amazon.com]], Lidl and [[House of Fabergé|Faberge]]. A marked proportion of fresh and frozen goods for northern supermarkets is dispatched by road from Doncaster.

===Regeneration initiatives===
[[File:Frenchgate south entrance.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frenchgate Centre|Frenchgate]] shopping centre]]
[[File:The New Doncaster College - geograph.org.uk - 426787.jpg|thumb|[[Doncaster College]]]]
On 5 March 2004, Doncaster was granted [[Fairtrade Town]] status. Over the last few years the [[Doncaster Lakeside]], as home to the Doncaster Rovers ground, has undergone modernisation. Doncaster has a bowling alley and a cinema near Lakeside. The Dome, opened in 1989 by [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]], contains a swimming pool, gym, ice rink and café.

The [[Frenchgate Centre]] is a shopping centre and transport interchange. Opened in June 2006,<ref>{{cite web |title=Doncaster Transport Interchange |url=http://www.doncaster-interchange.co.uk/ |access-date=8 March 2022 |website=www.doncaster-interchange.co.uk |archive-date=8 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220308115641/http://www.doncaster-interchange.co.uk/ |url-status=live}}</ref> it connects with the railway and bus stations.
Lakeside Village, a retail outlet with some 45 retail shops and restaurants lies along the [[A6182]] dual carriageway. The Waterdale area of the town centre is currently undergoing rejuvenation, with a new theatre (known as CAST), new civic offices and a new public square having been completed on the site of the Waterdale car park. The old council house and civic theatre have been demolished and new housing is being built in the town itself, opposite Doncaster Racecourse, and in out-of-town suburbs.

===Confectionery===
During the 19th and 20th centuries, confectioners based in Doncaster included [[Parkinson's Doncaster Butterscotch Company|Parkinson's]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.doncasterbutterscotch.com/ |title=Official Website of Parkinson's confectionery – The confectioners.

In August 2011, Parkinson's put its 190-year-old trademark up for sale on eBay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=120760820909 |title=Parkinson's Doncaster Butterscotch – inc trademark |publisher=eBay |access-date=11 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928030048/http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=120760820909 |archive-date=28 September 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Coal and industrial expansion===
The waterways, [[River Don, South Yorkshire|River Don]] and Don Navigation were used to transport coal from Doncaster to the steel production centres at [[Rotherham]], [[Scunthorpe]] and [[Sheffield]].

A large number of mining jobs were lost in the late 1980s. Today coal mining has ceased.

[[Rockware Glass]] is a specialist glass manufacturer. A production facility for chemical [[polymers]] was built in Wheatley Hall Road. It changed hands during its existence, until [[DuPont]] closed it in the mid-1990s.

Steel foundries, rolling mills and wire mills were built close to the railways that brought steel from Rotherham and Sheffield. [[Bridon Ropes]] produces wire rope, including the ropes used at coal mines to haul coal and miners. It is claimed to be the largest wire rope manufacturing plant in Europe. Bridon supplied wire rope for the [[Olympic Stadium (London)|Olympic Stadium]] for the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wireropeexchange.com/news/view/206/bridon-helps-raise-the-roof-on-the-2012-olympic-stadium |title=Bridon helps raise the roof on the 2012 Olympic Stadium |date=7 January 2010 |publisher=Wire Rope Exchange |access-date=23 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927201230/http://wireropeexchange.com/news/view/206/bridon-helps-raise-the-roof-on-the-2012-olympic-stadium |archive-date=27 September 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>

During the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s, the town became involved in munitions manufacture.

===The railways and locomotive works===
{{Main|Doncaster Works}}
During the [[Industrial Revolution]], the [[Great Northern Railway (England)|Great Northern Railway]] established the Doncaster Locomotive and Carriage Building Works; this was to meet Doncaster's communication needs, the necessity to transport coal quickly and efficiently, and due to Doncaster's expertise in specialist metal products. An extensive housing programme was undertaken for the increased population. The Chairman of the Great Northern, anxious about the workers and their families' spiritual welfare, persuaded the directors to contribute towards the building of St James's Church, which became known as the ''Plant Church''; the railway also built St James's School. 

The Doncaster Plant became famous for building [[London & North Eastern Railway|LNER]] locomotives ''[[LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman|Flying Scotsman]]'' and ''[[LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard|Mallard]]'', as well as many thousands more locomotives.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larkin |first=Edgar J. |title=The Railway Workshops of Britain, 1823–1986 |year=1988 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |isbn=0-333-39431-3 |oclc=59095511}}</ref> By August 2008, most of the plant complex had been razed to make way for a very large housing development. As of 2023, the owner of what remains of the plant, [[Wabtec]], performs the overhaul, maintenance and refurbishment of rail vehicles and associated components.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Wabtec UK Ltd |work=Doncaster Chamber |date=2023 |access-date=12 December 2023 |url=https://business.doncaster-chamber.co.uk/list/member/wabtec-uk-limited-778 |quote=}}</ref>

[[File:Doncaster station geograph-3849456-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|right|Doncaster railway station]]
Today, [[Doncaster railway station]] is a principal stop and interchange on the [[East Coast Main Line]]; it is linked directly to towns and cities across the UK. 

[[Doncaster PSB]] is one of the largest signalling centres on the UK network, controlling hundreds of route-miles of railway. [[Doncaster International Railport]] and [[Doncaster iPort]] are important road-rail intermodal terminals. The rail freight company [[DB Cargo UK]] has its headquarters in Doncaster.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.dbcargo.com/rail-uk-en/ourcompany/About_DB_Cargo_UK/history.html |title=Our History |publisher=DB Cargo UK |date=11 April 2016 |access-date=1 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202012458/http://uk.dbcargo.com/rail-uk-en/ourcompany/About_DB_Cargo_UK/history.html |archive-date=2 February 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Also nearby is one of the two ''National College for Advanced Transport and Infrastructure'' campuses that specialises in courses relating to the railways and transport systems.<ref>{{cite web |title=Doncaster Campus |url=https://www.nchsr.ac.uk/locations/doncaster-campus/ |access-date=23 September 2020 |website=NCATI |date=15 February 2017 |archive-date=21 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200921130438/https://www.nchsr.ac.uk/locations/doncaster-campus/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Aviation===
{{Main|RAF Doncaster}}
[[File:Robin Hood Airport, Finningley - geograph.org.uk - 915175.jpg|thumb|right|[[Doncaster Sheffield Airport]]]]
In 1909, [[Doncaster Racecourse]] was chosen as the venue for an airshow, after the world's first international air display in [[Reims]], France in 1909. Around a dozen aviators were present, the most famous being [[Léon Delagrange]] and [[Roger Sommer (aviator)|Roger Sommer]]. [[Samuel Cody]] (no relation to [[Buffalo Bill|William F. Cody]]) in an attempt to win a prize offered by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' for the first British pilot in a British aeroplane to fly a circular mile signed British [[naturalisation]] papers in front of the crowd with the band playing both ''[[God Save the Queen|God Save the King]]'' and the ''[[Star Spangled Banner]]''. Unfortunately, he crashed his aeroplane on the first day of the meeting and made no significant flights.

During the [[First World War]], fighters based first on the racecourse, then at a temporary airstrip near Finningley (later [[RAF Finningley]] and now [[Doncaster Sheffield Airport]]) and finally, in 1916, on a newly built airfield alongside the racecourse, were deployed to defend the east coast against [[Zeppelin]]s. On several occasions fighters took off to search for intruders but none were ever seen. The [[Royal Flying Corps]] station trained pilots for the war in France. Within months of the war ending the station was put up for sale and two of its three Belfast hangars, the same type that now forms the basis for the [[Royal Air Force Museum]] at [[Hendon]], were sold to a Sheffield motor manufacturing company for storage and assembly at [[Finningley]]. The third of the hangars stayed in place, mainly housing buses, until the 1970s, when it was knocked down and replaced with modern buildings.

In 1920, the government asked local authorities to assist in forming a chain of airfields for civil air services. Doncaster, with expert advice from [[Alan Cobham]], opened its aviation centre on 26 May 1934. Development of the airfield continued and on 1 July 1936 an international service was opened to [[Amsterdam]]. On 1 November 1938, after discussions with the [[Air Ministry]], [[No. 616 Squadron RAF|616 (South Yorkshire) Squadron]] of the [[Auxiliary Air Force|Royal Auxiliary Air Force]] was formed. Shortly after the outbreak of war in 1939 the squadron went to its battle station and played a part in the [[Battle of Britain]]. After the departure of 616 squadron, its place was taken by the formation of [[No. 271 Squadron RAF|271 (Transport) Squadron]] composed mainly of requisitioned civilian aircraft and obsolescent twin-engined bombers. 616 squadron was the first Allied jet fighter squadron, equipped with the [[Gloster Meteor]], famed for using their wingtips to throw German [[V-1 flying bomb]]s off course. In 1944, after being equipped with American-made [[Douglas DC-3]] Dakotas, the squadron moved south to take part in [[Operation Overlord]] and later in the airborne invasion at [[Arnhem]], where [[Flight Lieutenant]] [[David Lord (officer)|David Lord]] was awarded a [[Posthumous recognition|posthumous]] [[Victoria Cross]].

After the war the airfield reverted to civilian flying, and finally closed in 1992.

===Tractor production===
[[File:Ploughing - geograph.org.uk - 280384.jpg|thumb|Ploughing by tractor]]
In 1930, [[International Harvester]] (IH) started the production of agricultural implements at a factory on Wheatley Hall Road and later at another in the Carr Hill area of Doncaster. The first tractor built at the factory was a [[Farmall M]], which came off the production line on 13 September 1949.<ref>The Roar of Dust and Diesel ''A story of International Harvester Doncaster'', by Mike Teanby, published by Japonica Press (2004), {{ISBN|1-904686-06-0}}</ref> Tractors were initially built from parts shipped from the US. The Wheatley Hall Road factory was extended after the war with a new [[foundry]] to make the heavy castings. The factory started Crawler tractor production in 1953. By 1960, the factory was making a range of tractors from scratch, designed specifically for British and European markets and sold under the 'McCormick International' name. Assembly moved in 1965 to the Carr Hill plant. In 1983, tractor production was moved to IH's other Doncaster factory at Wheatley Hall. In 1985, International Harvester sold its agricultural division to Tenneco, Inc. which then merged it with its subsidiary J.I. Case to form [[Case IH]], which continued to design and build its European tractor range in Doncaster, but shutting the [[David Brown Ltd.]] tractor factory near [[Huddersfield]]. The 350,000th tractor came off the production line in 1999.

In 2000, the factory was purchased by [[ARGO SpA]], an Italian-based agricultural equipment builder. Doncaster was the sole production site of the [[McCormick Tractors]] brand, and the factory employed around 380 people (although about 1,100 people are employed in the worldwide McCormick group). In December 2006, the parent company, ARGO Spa, announced that the Doncaster facility would close in 2007, with the loss of around 325 jobs. The announcement was made only a week before Christmas. Sixty-one years of tractor production in Doncaster ended in 2007.

===Road===
Doncaster sits on the [[European route E15]] and is the starting point of [[European route E13]]. The E13 connects Doncaster, [[Sheffield]] and [[Nottingham]] to London. In the United Kingdom, European route designators are not displayed on road signs. The intended motorway design is evidenced in road maps. The M1 was extended northward to [[Leeds]], which is why the E13 starts at Doncaster and follows the path of the M18 and the M1.

Doncaster is situated on the [[A1 road (Great Britain)#A1(M)|A1(M)]] and [[M18 motorway (Great Britain)|M18]] motorways, within 20 minutes of the key [[M1 motorway|M1]] and [[M62 motorway|M62]] motorways.
The {{cvt|15|mi|km|adj=on}} A1(M) motorway bypass cost £6&nbsp;million and was opened by [[Ernest Marples]] in 1961. The former route is now the [[A638 road|A638]] and partly the [[A614 road|A614]] to [[Blyth, Nottinghamshire|Blyth]].

===Buses===
Bus services in the area are operated predominantly by [[First South Yorkshire]] and [[Stagecoach East Midlands]]. Routes connect the city with [[Barnsley]], [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]], [[Retford]], [[Scunthorpe]] and [[Worksop]]. Long-distance [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] coach routes travel to [[Birmingham Coach Station|Birmingham]], [[Hull Paragon Interchange|Hull]], [[Victoria Coach Station|London]] and [[Newcastle Coach Station|Newcastle]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Doncaster Town Centre Bus Services |work=Bus Times |date=2023 |access-date=23 September 2023 |url=https://bustimes.org/localities/doncaster-town-centre |archive-date=16 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231016144808/https://bustimes.org/localities/doncaster-town-centre |url-status=live}}</ref>

New developments include campus facilities for [[Doncaster College]] and the [[Frenchgate Interchange]], a unification of bus and railway stations with the [[Frenchgate Centre]]. The extension to the shopping centre and the new bus station opened on 8 June 2006, when all Doncaster bus routes started to use the station.

===Air===
Until 2022, Doncaster was a European hub with an international airport.
