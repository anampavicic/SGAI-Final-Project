'''San Carlos de Bariloche''', usually known as '''Bariloche''' ({{IPA|es|baɾiˈlotʃe}}), is a city in the province of [[Río Negro Province|Río Negro]], [[Argentina]], situated in the foothills of the [[Andes]] on the southern shores of [[Nahuel Huapi Lake]]. It is located within the [[Nahuel Huapi National Park]]. After development of extensive public works and Alpine-styled architecture, the city emerged in the 1930s and 1940s as a major tourism centre with [[skiing]], [[Backpacking (wilderness)|trekking]] and [[mountaineering]] facilities. In addition, it has numerous restaurants, cafés, and chocolate shops. The city had a permanent population of 108,205 according to the 2010 census.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anbariloche.com.ar/noticias/2010/11/25/17693-datos-provisorios-del-censo-bariloche-tiene-108205-habitantes|title = Datos provisorios del censo: Bariloche tiene 108.205 habitantes &#124; ANB :: Agencia de Noticias Bariloche - Diario online con noticias e información de Bariloche}}</ref> According to the latest statistics from 2015, the population is around 122,700, and a projection for 2020 estimates 135,704.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://poblacion.population.city/argentina/san-carlos-de-bariloche/|title = San Carlos de Bariloche · Población}}</ref>

==History==
The name ''Bariloche'' comes from the [[Mapudungun]] word ''Vuriloche'' meaning "people from behind the mountain" ({{lang|arn|vuri}} = behind, {{lang|arn|che}} = people). The [[Poya people]] used the Vuriloche pass to cross the Andes, keeping it secret from the Spanish priests for a long time.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

There is evidence of the existence of indigenous settlements on banks of Lake Nahuel Huapi, in the area now occupied by the city of Bariloche, prior to arrival of expeditionaries and white settlers. During the [[Neolithic]], the arrival of human beings to Nahuel Huapi region occurs. The archaeological and historical record speaks of tehuelches and puelches presence in the area. With the process of [[araucanization]] and mainly since the 17th century, the culture of these groups is strongly affected by Mapuches, who increased their presence from the settlement of Spaniards in Chile, and their continued push east.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bariloche.com.ar/museo/MAPU.HTM |title=La Nacion Mapuche |website=www.bariloche.com.ar |access-date=11 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104095240/http://www.bariloche.com.ar/museo/MAPU.HTM |archive-date=4 January 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

At 19th century end, in the vicinity of Nahuel Huapi, only a few scattered indigenous families were there: People of Inacayal had been stripped of their lands, and transferred to Tecka (Chubut) when the cacique was taken prisoner.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}} Curruhinca had made an act of submission to Argentine government with his own. Some Nguillatun was still being celebrated.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

But the region was beginning a new stage in its history. Although incorporated into national sovereignty, the Nahuel Huapi area began to develop fundamentally linked to Chile. Before 19th century end, when the border was still in dispute, people from the south of the neighboring country were gradually arriving to settle in surroundings of the lake. Small farmers were most of them from the island of Chiloe, but German immigrants living in Chile also arrived.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bariloche.com.ar/museo/DESTINO2.HTM |title=El Destino Del Desierto |website=bariloche.com.ar |access-date=11 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109160344/http://bariloche.com.ar/museo/DESTINO2.HTM |archive-date=9 January 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Spanish explorations and missions===

Nahuel Huapi lake was known to Spaniards since the times of the [[Conquest of Chile]]. Following the trails of the [[Mapuche]] people across the Andes, in the summer of 1552–1553, the Spanish Governor of the Captaincy of Chile [[Pedro de Valdivia]] sent [[Francisco de Villagra]] to explore the area east of the Andes at the latitudes of the city of [[Valdivia]]. Francisco de Villagra crossed the Andes through [[Mamuil Malal Pass]] and headed south until reaching [[Limay River]] in the vicinity of Nahuel Huapi Lake.<ref name=Urbina/>

Another early Spaniard to visit the zone of [[Nahuel Huapi Lake]] was the [[Jesuit]] priest [[Diego de Rosales]]. He had been ordered to the area by the [[Governor of Chile]] [[Francisco Antonio de Acuña Cabrera y Bayona|Antonio de Acuña Cabrera]], who was concerned about the unrest of the native [[Puelche people|Puelche]] and [[Poya people|Poya]] after the [[slave]]-hunting expeditions carried out by [[Luis Ponce de León]] in 1649, who captured Indians and sold them into slavery. Diego de Rosales started his journey at the ruins of [[Villarrica, Chile|Villarica]] in Chile, crossed the [[Andes]] through [[Mamuil Malal Pass]], and traveled further south along the eastern Andean valleys, reaching Nahuel Huapi Lake in 1650.<ref>[[Walter Hanisch|Hanisch, Walter]]. 1974. ''Historia de la Compañía de Jesús en Chile'', p. 33</ref>

In 1670, Jesuit priest [[Nicolás Mascardi]], based in [[Chiloé Archipelago]], entered the area through the [[Reloncaví Estuary]] and [[Todos los Santos Lake]] to found a mission at the Nahuel Huapi Lake, which lasted until 1673.<ref name=Urbina/> A new mission at the shores of Nahuel Huapi Lake was established in 1703, backed financially from [[Potosí]], thanks to orders from the [[viceroy of Peru]].<ref name=Urbina>{{cite journal |last1=Urbina |first1=Ximena|author-link=Ximena Urbina |year=2008 |title=The frustrated strategic mission of Nahuelhuapi, a point in Patagonia's immensity |journal=[[Magallania]] |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=5–30 |url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0718-22442008000100001&lng=es&nrm=iso&tlng=es |access-date=26 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218082417/http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0718-22442008000100001&lng=es&nrm=iso&tlng=es |archive-date=18 February 2017}}</ref> Historians disagree if the mission belonged to the jurisdiction of [[Valdivia]] or [[Governorate of Chiloé|Chiloé]].<ref name=Urbina/> According to historic documents, the [[Poya people|Poya]] of Nahuelhuapi requested the mission to be reestablished, apparently to forge an alliance with the Spaniards against the [[Puelche people|Puelche]].<ref name=Urbina/> Following the [[1712 Huilliche rebellion]] in [[Chiloé Archipelago]] some insurgents sought refuge with Father Manuel del Hoyo in the mission.<ref name="UrbinaRebellion1990">{{cite journal |last=Urbina |first=Rodolfo |year=1990 |title=La rebelión indígena de 1712: los tributarios de Chiloé contra la encomienda |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/archivos2/pdfs/MC0008625.pdf |journal=Tiempo y Espacio |issue=1 |pages=73–86 |location=Chillán |publisher=El Departamento |language=es }}</ref>

The mission was destroyed in 1717 by Poyas following a disagreement with the missionaries; the superior of the mission had refused to give them a cow.<ref name=Urbina/> Soon thereafter authorities learned that four or five people travelling to [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]] had been killed by the Poya. The colonists assembled a [[punitive expedition]] in [[Calbuco]] and Chiloé.<ref name=Urbina/> Composed of both Spaniards and [[indios reyunos]], the expedition did not find any Poya.<ref name=Urbina/>

In 1766 the head of the Mission of [[Los Lagos, Chile|Ralún]] tried to reestablish the mission at Nahuel Huapi, but the following year, the Crown [[suppression of the Society of Jesus|suppressed the Society of Jesus]], ordering them out of the colonies in the Americas.<ref name=Urbina/>

=== 19th century to 1895 ===
[[File:Bariloche oeste.jpg|thumb|right|View of the city]]
The area had stronger connections to Chile than to the distant city of Buenos Aires during most of the 19th century, but the explorations of [[Francisco Moreno]] and the Argentine campaigns of the [[Conquest of the Desert]] established the legitimacy of the Argentine government. It thought the area was a natural expansion of the [[Viedma]] colony and the Andes were the natural frontier to Chile. In the [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina|1881 border treaty between Chile and Argentina]], the Nahuel Huapi area was recognized as part of Argentina.

[[German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|German settlers]] begun to arrive in neighboring [[Zona Sur|southern Chile]] from the 1840s. Some of these settlers and their descendants begun a lucrative leather industry obtaining leather from indigenous communities across the Andes.<ref name=munoz2014/> In the 1880s, the Argentine Army displaced indigenous communities, disrupting this trade and forcing leather merchants in Chile to cross the Andes to obtain supplies. This way numerous entrepreneurs from Chile, many with a German background, established cattle and trade business in the area of Nahuel Huapi and [[Lácar Lake|Lácar]] lakes.<ref name=munoz2014/>

=== Modern settlement ===
In the summer of 1894-1895 [[Carlos Wiederhold]], a [[German-Chilean]] from [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]], Chile,<ref name=munoz2014/> crossed the poorly known [[mountain pass]]es of the Andes from Chile into Nahual Huapi Lake. He was aided by the guide Antonio Millaqueo and Daniel Márquez from [[Chiloé Archipelago|Chiloé]] helped them in navigating the lake. Back in Chile Wiederhold bought provisions in [[Puerto Montt]] and brought them across the Andes to sell these in the Nahuel Huapi area.<ref name=LauraJorge>{{Cite journal|title=Carlos Weiderhold y la "fundación" de Bariloche|journal=Trabajo Independiente?|last1=Méndez|first1=Laura M.|last2=Muñoz Sougarret|first2=Jorge}}</ref> Wiederhold established then a little shop called ''La Alemana'' (The German) in 1895, and it is from this shop the modern settlement of Bariloche developed from.<ref name=munoz2014>{{cite journal |last1=Muñoz Sougarret |first1=Jorge |date=2014 |title=Relaciones de dependencia entre trabajadores y empresas chilenas situadas en el extranjero.

The Chilean entrepreneurs expanded beyond trade and established husbandry operations around Nahuel Huapi Lake. These enterprises exported meat to [[Central Chile]] and imported labour from southern Chile, mainly [[Chiloé Archipelago]], to run the business.<ref name=munoz2014/> Argentine authorities encouraged at first the immigration of Chileans offering land properties if they renounced the Chilean citizenship becoming Argentines.<ref name=munoz2014/> Chilean authorities responded by offering land to those that returned from Argentina.<ref name=munoz2014/> As spontaneous migration from Chiloé Archipelago begun to replace those brought in by enterprises the Argentine authorities came to distrust these migrants. Many independent settlers from Chiloé Archipelago established themselves in [[Valle Manso]] south of Bariloche.<ref name=munoz2014/> In the words of historian Jorge Muñoz Sougarett, Argentine authorities viewed these Chileans settlers as "illiterate nomads, vicious and unruly".<ref name=munoz2014/>

In the 1930s, the centre of the city was redesigned to have the appearance of a traditional European central alpine town (it was called "Little Switzerland.") Many buildings were made of wood and stone. In 1909 there were 1,250 inhabitants; a telegraph, post office, and a road connected the city with [[Neuquén]]. Commerce continued to depend on Chile until the arrival of the [[Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway|railroad]] in 1934, which connected the city with Argentine markets.

===Architectural development and tourism===
[[File:Argentina - Bariloche trekking 012 - Glacier Castaño Overo spilling water and ice over the cliff on Cerro Tronador (6834286802).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Tronador#Glaciers|Glacier Castaño Overo]] spilling water and ice over the cliff on [[Tronador|Cerro Tronador]]]]

Between 1935 and 1940, the Argentine Directorate of National Parks carried out a number of urban public works, giving the city a distinctive architectural style. Among them, perhaps the best-known is the Civic Centre.

Bariloche grew from being a centre of cattle trade that relied on commerce with Chile, to becoming a tourism centre for the Argentine elite. It took on a cosmopolitan architectural and urban profile. Growth in the city's tourist trade began in the 1930s, when local hotel occupancy grew from 1550 tourists in 1934 to 4000 in 1940.<ref name="Policy">[http://nulan.mdp.edu.ar/314/1/Apo2006a10v1pp43%2D61.pdf Tourism Policy in 20th-century Argentina]</ref> In 1934 Ezequiel Bustillo, then director of the National Parks Direction, contracted his brother [[Alejandro Bustillo]] to build several buildings in [[Iguazú National Park|Iguazú]] and [[Nahuel Huapi National Park]] (Bariloche was the main settlement inside the park). In contrast to subtropical [[Iguazú National Park]], planners and developers thought that Nahuel Huapi National Park, because of its temperate climate, could compete with the tourism of Europe. Together with Bariloche, it was established for priority projects by national tourism development planners.<ref name="Policy" />[[File:15 - San Carlos de Bariloche (Argentina).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Chairlifts in the [[Cerro Catedral]]]][[Alejandro Bustillo]] designed the Edificio Movilidad, Plaza Perito Moreno, the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] San Carlos de Bariloche Cathedral, and the [[Llao Llao Hotel]]. Architect Ernesto de Estrada designed the Civic Centre of Bariloche, which opened in 1940. The Civic Centre's tuff stone, slate and ''[[Fitzroya]]'' structures include the [[Domingo Sarmiento]] Library, the [[Francisco Moreno Museum of Patagonia]], City Hall, the Post Office, the Police Station, and the Customs.

U.S. President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] visited Bariloche as a guest of President [[Arturo Frondizi]] in 1960. Classical violinist [[Alberto Lysy]] established the string quartet [[Camerata Bariloche]] in 1967.

===Huemul Project===
{{main|Huemul Project}}

During the 1950s, on the small island of Huemul, not far into lake Nahuel Huapi, former president [[Juan Domingo Perón]] tried to have the world's first fusion reactor built secretly. The project cost the equivalent of about $300 million modern US dollars, and it was never finished, due to the lack of the highly advanced technology that was needed. The Austrian [[Ronald Richter]] was in charge of the project. The facilities can still be visited, and are visible from certain locations on the coast.

=== Nazis in Bariloche ===
{{see also|Conspiracy theories about Adolf Hitler's death}}
In 1995, Bariloche made headlines in the international press when it became known as a place for [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] war criminals, such as the former [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] ''[[Hauptsturmführer]]'' [[Erich Priebke]] and SS officer [[Reinhard Kopps]], known in Argentina as Juan Maler. Priebke had been the director of the German School of Bariloche for many years.

The narrative that [[Adolf Hitler]] did not commit suicide, but instead escaped Berlin, was first presented to the general public by Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]] at a press conference on 9 June 1945 on orders from Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Joachimsthaler |first=Anton |author-link=Anton Joachimsthaler |year=1999 |orig-year=1995 |title=The Last Days of Hitler: The Legends, The Evidence, The Truth |publisher=Brockhampton Press |location=London |isbn=978-1-86019-902-8}}</ref>{{rp|22, 23}} That month, 68% of Americans polled thought Hitler was still alive.<ref name=":1">{{cite news |last=Le Faucher |first=Christelle |date=May 21, 2018 |title=Is Hitler Dead or Alive? |work=[[The National WWII Museum]] |url=https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/hitler-dead-or-alive |access-date=2022-03-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330003725/https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/hitler-dead-or-alive |archive-date=2019-03-30}}</ref> When asked at the [[Potsdam Conference]] in July 1945 how Hitler had died, Stalin said he was either living "in Spain or Argentina."<ref>{{cite web |last=Beschloss |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Beschloss |title=Dividing the Spoils |website=Smithsonian Magazine |date=December 2002 |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/dividing-the-spoils-73307705/ |access-date=14 September 2018}}</ref>

In his 2004 book ''Bariloche nazi-guía turística'', Argentine author Abel Basti claims that Adolf Hitler and [[Eva Braun]] lived in the surroundings of Bariloche for many years after World War II.<ref name=basti>{{Cite web | url=http://www.absurddiari.com/s/llegir.php?llegir=llegir&ref=3656 | title=Un libro asegura que Hitler se refugió en la Patagonia | access-date=5 November 2011 | archive-date=9 February 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210209170207/http://www.absurddiari.com/s/llegir.php?llegir=llegir&ref=3656 | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.rense.com/general47/refuge.htm |title = Argentina - Bariloche Was Hitler and Eva Braun's Final Refuge}}</ref> Basti said that the Argentine Nazis chose the estate of ''Inalco'' as Hitler's refuge.<ref name=basti/>

''[[Grey Wolf: The Escape of Adolf Hitler]]'', a 2011 book by British authors Simon Dunstan and Gerrard Williams, proposed that Hitler and Eva Braun escaped from Berlin in 1945 and flew to Denmark, then on to Spain and from there to the Canary Islands, where they boarded a [[U-Boat]] and crossed the Atlantic to Argentina, where thousands of Nazis were provided sanctuary by president [[Juan Perón]], who, with his wife [[Eva Perón]], had been receiving money from the Nazis for some time. As claims received by the [[FBI]] stated, Hitler allegedly arrived in Argentina, first staying at Hacienda San Ramón, a rural property {{convert|6|mi|km|0|order=flip}} east of Bariloche owned by Stephan von Schaumburg-Lippe, a relative of [[Prince Bernhard]],<ref name="fbi">{{cite web |title=FBI – Adolf Hitler Part 01 of 04 – File No 105-410 |url=http://vault.fbi.gov/adolf-hitler/adolf-hitler-part-01-of-04/view |access-date=3 September 2014 |publisher=vault.fbi.gov}}</ref> then moved to [[Inalco House|a&nbsp;Bavarian-style mansion at Inalco]], a remote and barely accessible spot at the northwest end of Nahuel Huapi Lake, close to the [[Argentina–Chile border|Chilean border]]. Supposedly, Eva Braun left Hitler around 1954 and moved to [[Neuquén]] with their daughter Ursula ('Uschi'). Adolf Hitler died in February 1962 at age 73, and Eva Braun was alleged to be alive in the 2000s.<ref name=grey>Dunstan, Simon and Williams, Gerrard. (2011) ''Grey Wolf: The Escape of Adolf Hitler''. New York: Sterling Publishing. {{isbn|9781402781391}}</ref>

These accounts are disputed by most historians, who generally believe that Hitler and Braun committed suicide in the [[Führerbunker]] during last days of World War II.

==Tourism==
Tourism, both domestic and international, is the main economic activity of Bariloche throughout the year. The city is very popular with Brazilians, Europeans and Israelis. One of the most popular activities is skiing, and most tourists visit Bariloche in winter (June–September). Regular flights from Buenos Aires via [[LAN airlines]] and [[Aerolíneas Argentinas]] serve the city year round. The main ski slopes are the ones at [[Cerro Catedral]], the biggest ski resort in South America and in the southern hemisphere. During the summer, beautiful beaches such as Playa Bonita and Villa Tacul welcome sun-bathers; brave lake swimmers venture into its cold waters (chilled by melting snow). Lake Nahuel Huapi averages {{cvt|14|°C}} in the summertime. Bariloche is the biggest city of a huge Lakes District, and it serves as a base for many excursions in the region. Activities such as fishing, whitewater rafting, and birdwatching are popular with tourists. Trekking along trails in the nearby mountain wilderness is supported by a few high-mountain huts operated by the [[Club Andino Bariloche]]. The city is noted for its chocolates and Swiss-style architecture. Many high school students in Argentina take a senior trip to Bariloche, and the town is well prepared to host these kinds of groups.<ref>Bao, S. et al. 2014.Argentina Travel Guide. 9th Edition.

==Science==
[[File:RA6cab.jpg|thumb|right|Reactor core of the RA-6 Training and Research Reactor at [[Centro Atómico Bariloche]].]]
Besides tourism and related services, Bariloche is home of advanced scientific and technological activities. The [[Centro Atómico Bariloche]] is a research center of the [[National Atomic Energy Commission]], where basic and applied research in many areas of the physical sciences is carried out. The complex also houses [[Instituto Balseiro]], a higher education institution of the [[Universidad Nacional de Cuyo]], with a small and carefully selected number of students. The institute confers degrees in Physics and Nuclear, Mechanical and Telecommunications Engineering, as well as Masters and Doctorate degrees in Physics and Engineering. The city also hosts [[INVAP]], a high-technology company that designs and builds nuclear reactors, state-of-the-art radars and space satellites, among other projects.

The private, non-profit organization Bariloche Foundation continues the tradition of scientific research in the city. Started in 1963, it promotes postgraduate teaching and research. There are also several departments and laboratories at the [[National University of Comahue]].

Bariloche lies in the transition between a cool [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csb'') and an [[Oceanic climate]] (Köppen: ''Cfb''), with marked alpine characteristics (low nighttime temperatures, wide temperature variations, high thermal amplitude). The combination of its altitude, latitude, and predominance of west-northwest winds cause the climate to be classified as a cool temperate climate with a dry season that presents a west–east precipitation gradient.<ref name=INTAclima>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011015219/http://sipan.inta.gob.ar/productos/ssd/vc/bariloche/ig/clima.htm |archive-date=11 October 2018 |url=http://sipan.inta.gob.ar/productos/ssd/vc/bariloche/ig/clima.htm |title=Clima de Bariloche y Río Manso Inferior |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria |language=es |access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref> Mean annual precipitation ranges from {{convert|4000|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in the Andean peaks and in [[Puerto Blest]] to only {{convert|600|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in the [[Limay River]] area.<ref name=INTAclima/> In the urban areas, mean annual precipitation ranges from  {{convert|800|to|1,000|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=INTAclima/> Most of this is concentrated in autumn and winter, which are responsible for 70% of the annual precipitation.<ref name=INTAclima/>

The mean annual temperature in Bariloche is {{convert|8.4|°C|F|0}} in the city centre (1901–1950).<ref name=INTAclima/> At the airport in the eastern end, the mean annual temperature is {{convert|8.3|°C|F|0}} (for the period 1981–2010).<ref name=INTAclima/><ref name = SMNclimatenormals/> In January, daytime temperatures normally range from {{convert|20|to|28|°C|F|0}} and may occasionally go up to {{convert|30|°C|F|0}}.<ref name=INTAclima/> The average minimum in January is {{convert|8.2|°C|F|0}} at the city centre and {{convert|6.6|°C|F|0}} at the airport although during warm days, nighttime temperatures can reach to {{convert|15|°C|F|0}}.<ref name=INTAclima/><ref name = INTA/><ref name = SMNclimatenormals/> In winter, daytime temperatures range from {{convert|1|to|8|°C|F|0}} while nighttime temperatures approach freezing or less.<ref name=INTAclima/> Temperatures vary by altitude; in general, the temperature decreases by {{convert|6|C-change|0}} for every {{convert|1000|m|ft|0}} increase in altitude.<ref name=INTAclima/>

The weather is characterized by being windy throughout the year; 85% of the days are windy and calm days are rare.<ref name=INTAclima/> Most of the wind predominantly comes from the west-northwest with easterly winds being rare.<ref name=INTAclima/> Normally, the winds are strong, particularly in spring where gusts can exceed {{convert|100|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=INTAclima/>

At the city centre, mean annual precipitation is {{convert|1092|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in which there are 122 days with precipitation.<ref name=INTAclima/> In the eastern end where the airport is located, precipitation is lower, averaging {{convert|791|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=INTAclima/> In winter when temperatures are lower, snowfall can occur, which is favoured by the low evapotranspiration.<ref name=INTAclima/> In spring, melt from snow and lower temperatures lead to moist conditions that facilitate the development of dense forest and agricultural activities.<ref name=INTAclima/>

The water temperatures in the lakes are always low, ranging from {{convert|12|to|15|°C|F|0}}.<ref name=INTAclima/> This is due to the lakes being large, making it difficult for the sun to influence their temperature, owing to their large heat capacity.<ref name=INTAclima/> Smaller lakes can freeze in the winter, particularly those located in the higher elevations.<ref name=INTAclima/>

Bariloche is in the transition area between the [[Patagonian steppe]] and [[Bosque Andino Patagónico|Valdivian forest]], therefore it is rich in a variety of native species, of which the following is a list.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parkswatch.org/parkprofile.php?l=spa&country=arg&park=nhnp&page=ref|title=Parque Nacional Nahuel Huapi - Perfil de Parque - Referencias|access-date=26 May 2020|archive-date=15 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210215021628/https://www.parkswatch.org/parkprofile.php?l=spa&country=arg&park=nhnp&page=ref|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Transportation==
[[File:Aerolineas Argentinas B737-500 at Bariloche Airport.jpg|thumb|right|Bariloche Airport.]]
The city is served by [[San Carlos de Bariloche International Airport]] ([[IATA]] BRC/[[ICAO]] SAZS) equipped to receive any kind of aircraft. Several of [[Argentina]]'s most important airlines maintain regular flights to Bariloche, as well as some international lines from neighbouring countries, especially during the ski season. The city is linked by train with the city of [[Viedma]] through the [[Tren Patagonico]] that crosses Argentina from the [[Andes]] to the Atlantic Ocean.

Bariloche can also be reached by buses and private cars. The main land routes from North are [[National Route 40 (Argentina)|RN 40]], coming from [[Villa La Angostura]], [[San Martín de los Andes]] and [[Mendoza Province]], and RN 237 that enters from [[Neuquén]] and connects through Argentine's route system with [[Buenos Aires]] and Eastern/Central Argentina. Other options are, from the East, by RN 23 (partially paved), crossing the railway line to [[Viedma]] (''Línea Sur''), or from the South by RN 40, coming from the town of [[El Bolsón, Río Negro|El Bolsón]] (until 2003 this road was numbered RN 258).

San Carlos de Bariloche lies close to the [[Chile]]an border and is connected to Chile by the [[Cardenal Antonio Samoré Pass]] (125&nbsp;km North-West from Bariloche, near Villa La Angostura) crossing the [[Andes]] Mountains.

A terminal railway station links Bariloche to [[Viedma, Río Negro|Viedma]].

===Internal transportation===

Within the city, Mibus is the single mass transit bus company that works, this bus line operates with the SUBE card. The Company Las Grutas that connects Bariloche with Dina Huapi also runs through part of the city, although this line operates with its own card.

==Military==
Bariloche is home of the army's "12° Regimiento de Infantería de Montaña" (12th Mountain Infantry Regiment), where military personnel are instructed in mountainous conditions, including combat, survival, and skiing. It is usual for the Regiment to receive infantry personnel from other parts of the country and train them. Furthermore, the ''Escuela Militar de Montaña'', the mountain warfare school of the [[Argentine Army]] is located in Bariloche.<ref>[http://www.ejercito.mil.ar/sitio/_noticias/noticia_full.asp?Id=814 http://www.ejercito.mil.ar/sitio/_noticias/noticia_full.asp?Id=814] {{in lang|es}}, Argentine Army.</ref>

==Neighbourhoods==
The main Neighbourhoods are Belgrano, Jardín Botánico, Melipal, Centro, Las Victorias, Las Marias, Dos Valles, and Playa Bonita.

== Municipal landfill – Health policies ==
[[File:Vertedero Bariloche.webp|thumb|Bariloche municipal landfill.]]
The city of Bariloche has one of the fifty most dangerous landfills for [[natural environment]] of the world. This was indicated by a report that was carried out by the environmental organization [[International Solid Waste Association]] (ISWA), based in [[Austria]].

The request for the transfer of the Bariloche dump, located on [[National Route 40 (Argentina)]] south, was being surrounded by neighborhoods with a high population density, it is already historic. Added to the situation of environmental collapse is the desperate situation of a large number of people who go to the dump daily in search of food or shelter. In addition, the fires in various sectors of the landfill also became recurrent, affecting not only those who work in the dump but also the closest neighborhoods,  without forgetting to mention the forests that surround it, the fauna that inhabits them, and the water, that is deposited in layers that end up in the lake from which the local inhabitants extract the water to drink.

== Sports ==
The ''[[Andes|Andean]] Club Bariloche'' ({{langx|es|link=no|Club Andino Bariloche-CAB}}) was co-organiser of the [[2005 South American Ski Mountaineering Championship|1st]] and the [[2009 South American Ski Mountaineering Championship|3rd South American Ski Mountaineering Championships]].

The [[Cruz del Sur de Bariloche|Club Deportivo Cruz del Sur]] takes part in Torneo Federal B, the fourth tier of the [[Argentine football league system]]. The sides ''Estudiantes Unidos'' and ''Estrella del Sur'' also participated in lower Argentine leagues.
