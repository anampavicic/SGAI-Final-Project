==History==
[[File:KITLV A393 - Huizen aan een weg te San Fernando de la Pampanga op de Filippijnen, KITLV 83869.tiff|thumb|left|Houses along a road in San Fernando, circa pre-1900]]

The town of San Fernando was founded in 1754 from the towns of [[Bacolor]] and [[Mexico, Pampanga|Mexico]]. The first church was built in 1755 with wooden walls and nipa roofing. The municipal tribunal was erected later in the year in front of the town plaza using durable materials and thatched nipa roofing. Don Vidal de Arrozal served as its first gobernadorcillo that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hau.edu.ph/kapampangan_center/publication/pdf/singsing/a-tale-of-two-cities.pdf|title=Henares, Ivan Anthony. Timeline of San Fernando History. Singsing, Vol. 4 No. 1|publisher=Center for Kapampangan Studies}}</ref>

In 1796, after serving as gobernadorcillo the previous year, Don Ángel Pantaleon de Miranda retired to Barrio Saguin, from where he started setting up his hacienda in Barrio Culiat. The barrio was separated from San Fernando on the December 8, 1829 as the new town of [[Angeles City|Angeles]], with the Los Santos Ángeles Custodios as titular patrons.

An expediente requesting the transfer of the provincial capital of [[Pampanga]] to San Fernando was signed on the August 6, 1852. Real Cedula 745, approving the transfer of the provincial capital of Pampanga from Bacolor to San Fernando, was signed on September 11, 1881. This transfer did not, in the event, materialize.

In 1878, actions were made to create the town of Calulut. This new town would be composed of Calulut and the neighboring barrios of Bulaun, Malpitic, Sindalan, La Paz, Lara, Saguin, Telabastagan, Balete, Malinao, Pulung Bulu, Panipuan, Macabacle and the caserio of Pau in San Fernando, and Panipuan, Acle, Suclaban and the sitio of Gandus in Mexico. This plan did not materialize, owing to strong opposition from the parish priest of San Fernando.

Governor-General [[Eulogio Despujol y Dusay|Eulogio Despujol]] and Manila Archbishop Bernardino Nozaleda inaugurated the San Fernando railroad station, together with the Bagbag-Mabalacat stretch of the Manila-Dagupan Railroad, on February 2, 1892. The station was second only to Manila in revenues that year, and was thus the most important provincial station of the Manila-Dagupan Railroad. On June 27 of the same year, [[José P. Rizal]] made a stopover in the town as part of his mission to recruit members to the [[La Liga Filipina]].

On September 1, 1896, the town was declared to be in a state of war despite its peaceful situation. Brigadier General Diego de los Rios arrived on December 2 to calm the revolution that started in Manila on August 30. General Ruiz Serralde took over Rios's post on June 26, 1897, to maintain the peace in San Fernando. The revolution was not yet at its height with occasional exchanges of fire in some places in Pampanga.

On June 26, 1898, representatives from all Pampanga towns, except [[Macabebe, Pampanga|Macabebe]], gathered in San Fernando to swear allegiance to Gen. Maximino Hizon, who was the provincial military governor and representative of the revolutionary president, Emilio Aguinaldo. On October 9, Aguinaldo and his cabinet visited the town, and were welcomed with so much applause and enthusiastic cheering from the public. He proceeded to the convento which was served as the military headquarters at that time.

On May 4, 1899, Philippine revolutionary troops led by General [[Antonio Luna]] burned the ''casa municipal'', the town church and several houses to render them useless to the approaching American forces. On June 16, due to the strategic location of the town, Aguinaldo himself led Filipino forces in the Battle for San Fernando. The plan to retake the town proved unsuccessful. Calulut fell to the Americans on August 9.

On August 15, 1904, the Pampanga provincial government was finally transferred to San Fernando from Bacolor, by virtue of Act No. 1204 signed on July 22, 1904. This was during the term of Governor Macario Arnedo and Municipal President Juan Sengson. The town of [[Minalin]] became part of San Fernando that same year. It would regain its political independence in 1909.

On January 2, 1905, the town of [[Santo Tomas, Pampanga|Santo Tomas]] was consolidated with San Fernando by virtue of Act 1208.

On August 12, 1904, U.S. Secretary of War [[William H. Taft]] visited the town to get first-hand information and gather ideas for the governance of Pampanga. Owing to the short notice, a bamboo pavilion was hastily constructed for his visit, where he was welcomed with a banquet for 200 people. Taft would later be elected President of the United States.

In 1921, the [[Pampanga Sugar Development Company]] (PASUDECO) sugar central began its operations. The company was formed in 1918 by large-scale planters such as José de León, Augusto Gonzales, [[Francisco Tongio Liongson]], Tomás Lazatin, Tomás Consunji, Francisco Hizon, José Henson, and Manuel Urquico in the San Fernando residence of Governor Honorio Ventura as part of a plan to construct a locally financed ''central''.

In 1932, the [[Socialist Party of the Philippines]] was founded by [[Pedro Abad Santos]]. Two years later, he created and headed the [[Aguman ding Maldang Talapagobra]] (AMT). The Abad Santos compound in Barangay San Jose became the focal point of the peasant movement.

On February 14, 1939, Philippine president [[Manuel L. Quezon]] proclaimed his social justice program before a gathering of farmers in front of the Municipal Government building.

[[File:Landing Fields - Philippines - Luzon Island - NARA - 68161174.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of San Fernando, circa 1940s]]
In 1941, forces of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] occupied the town and placed the municipal government under its supervision. The following year, thousands of Filipino and American [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] walked from Bataan to the San Fernando Train Station in what will be known as the [[Bataan Death March]].

In 1952, the town of [[Santo Tomas, Pampanga|Santo Tomas]] was separated from San Fernando.

On December 16, 1980, [[Jose B. Lingad]], a lawyer and politician, was shot dead at the gasoline station while sitting alone in the driver's seat of his car in the morning by a lone gunman during the [[Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos|Martial law]] under the President and dictator [[Ferdinand Marcos]].<ref>{{cite web |title=An Opposition Filipino Politician Shot to Death at Gasoline Station |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/12/17/archives/an-opposition-filipino-politician-shot-to-death-at-gasoline-station.html |date=17 December 1980 |website=The New York Times |access-date=30 October 2022}}</ref>

In 1986, Paterno Guevarra was sworn in as officer-in-charge of the town after the successful People Power Revolution that toppled the Marcos dictatorship that same year. He was later elected municipal mayor. On December 31, 1987, former mayor Armando Biliwang was campaigning in Barangay San Jose to be elected mayor again when communist insurgents from the [[New People's Army]] fired gunshots in his direction, narrowly avoiding getting killed while his nephew was fatally wounded.<ref>{{cite news|last=Roxas|first=Alfredo M.|title=NPA extorting from candidates|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fZAtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UAsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4611%2C306302|access-date=February 2, 2023|work=[[Manila Standard]]|publisher=Standard Publications, Inc.|date=January 6, 1988|page=8}}</ref>

In 1990, Philippine president [[Corazon Aquino]] inaugurated the Paskuhan Village, the first Christmas village in Asia and the third of its kind in the world. The following year, [[Mount Pinatubo]] erupted after over 600 years of dormancy hurling a layer of ash and volcanic debris on the town.

On October 1, 1995, [[Typhoon Sibyl (Mameng)]] struck the town. It unleashed floodwaters and mudflows from Mount Pinatubo into the town. The Barangays of Santo Nino, San Juan, San Pedro Cutud and Magliman were severely damaged by lahar. The citizens of San Fernando rallied to save the town by raising funds to build the St. Ferdinand People's Dike. The Pampanga Megadike was constructed the following year, thus preventing further damage to the town.<ref name="ReferenceA">Henares, Ivan Anthony S.

===Industries===
[[File:Pasudeco1.jpg|thumb|PASUDECO Sugar Central]]
San Fernando serves as one of the agricultural processing centers of Central Luzon. It is a major rice-producing region and an important sugar-producing area. The Pampanga Sugar Development Company (PASUDECO) was once the largest private employer in Pampanga. It is a major sugar-processing plant in the region. Other manufacturing companies with offices in the city include [[Universal Robina]], Zuellig Pharma, [[Nestlé]] Philippines, Petrophil, Mondragon Industries, JBTEC Flavors and Blends Inc. [[Asia Brewery]], and [[Del Monte Corporation]]. Major food and beverage companies such as [[San Miguel Corporation]], Coca-Cola, Pepsi Cola, and Pampanga's Best, have factories in the city.

Every year during Christmas season, the city becomes the center of production of hand-made ''[[parol]]s'', which is different from the usual ones for its intricate designs and the illusion of dancing lights, emphasizing the lanterns' vibrant colors. Also, every year around Christmas time is the Giant Parol Festival, where barangays of San Fernando come together for a friendly competition to see which lanterns are the best. The festival itself is held in the middle of December, and is originally held in the town of Bacolor until it was transferred to the city in August 1904, in an event called the ''Ligligan Parol'' in the [[Kapampangan language]], which many believe to have never happened in that year. Following the formal transfer of the festival to the city in 1908, the Giant Parol Festival went on to be a tradition that has evolved with lanterns becoming larger and larger and the designs more intricate. Since then, it became a symbol of the city's unity and the resident's labor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cityofsanfernando.gov.ph/|title=History of The City of San Fernando|author=City Information and Communications Technology Office|website=City of San Fernando - Christmas Capital of the Philippines}}</ref>{{clear-left}}
