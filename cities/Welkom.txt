'''Welkom''' ({{IPA|af|ˈvɛlkɔm}}) is the second-largest city in the [[Free State (province)|Free State]] province of [[South Africa]], located about {{convert|140|km|-1}} northeast of [[Bloemfontein]], the provincial capital. Welkom is also known as '''Circle City''', '''City Within A Garden''', '''Mvela''' and '''Matjhabeng'''. The city's [[sotho language|Sesotho]] name, ''Matjhabeng'' means 'where nations meet', derived from the migrant labour system, where people of various countries such as [[Lesotho]], [[Malawi]] and [[Mozambique]] etc. met to work in the mines of the [[Gold mining|gold fields]].

A settlement was laid out on a farm named "[[wikt:welkom|Welkom]]" (which is the [[Afrikaans]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word for "[[wikt:welcome|welcome]]") after gold was discovered in the region, and it was officially proclaimed a town in 1948. The town became a municipality in 1961.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of South African Place Names |page=470 |url=https://archive.org/stream/DictionaryOfSouthernAfricanPlaceNames/SaPlaceNames#page/n470/mode/1up |first=P. E. |last=Raper |year=1987 |publisher=Lowry Publishers |isbn=0947042067}}</ref> It now falls in the [[Matjhabeng Local Municipality|Matjhabeng Municipality]], part of the [[Lejweleputswa District Municipality|Lejweleputswa District]]. Welkom was officially declared a city on 14 February 1968.

==History==
Much of the history of Welkom is centred around the [[Free State goldfields|discovery of gold in the northwestern Free State]]. It was proclaimed a town in 1948, nine years after a major gold discovery was made in [[Odendaalsrus]], just north of Welkom.

===Early mining activity===
[[File:Prospecting pit of Arthur Megson in 1904.jpg|thumb|220x220px|left|Prospecting pit of Arthur Megson circa 1904]] The first prospecting in the area was done by the [[English (people)|Englishmen]] Mr Donaldson and Mr Hinds on a portion of the farm Zoeten-Inval in 1896. The men discovered a small outcrop which seemed to be a conglomerate pebble reef, but they failed to raise interest among mining companies who at that stage did not believe that there was gold to be discovered south of the [[Vaal River]]. They returned to England to test the samples they had extracted, but died before reaching their destination when their ship sank in the [[Bay of Biscay]].

Prospector Arthur Megson heard of their venture and decided to investigate near the town of Odendaalsrus in 1904. He gathered samples of exposed strata near an outcrop, which by then was part of Hendrik Petrus Klopper's farm ''Aandenk''. He too did not succeed in obtaining any interest from companies until October 1932, when he presented his findings to Allan Roberts and Mannie Jacobs. The area needed to be tested by drilling, and the first borehole was started on 5 May 1933. Jacobs managed to interest two men, Fritz Marx and Peter Woolf, in the venture and the Wit Extensions Company was formed later that year. Although the borehole, which by then penetrated more than 1200 metres, yielded 120-inch [[pennyweights]] of gold (roughly 480 centimetre grams per ton), it was not enough to garner financial assistance and the operation had to close due to depleted finances. (For gold ores to be payable in South Africa, the grade must typically exceed 960 cengrams – the equivalent of 8 grams per ton over a 120&nbsp;cm stope width, which after dilution will yield 4g/t in the mill).

However, the discovery of gold-bearing reef in the [[Klerksdorp]] area in 1933 by the [[Anglo American Corporation]] encouraged geologists and others with vision to see the northwestern Free State as a potential gold field. Prospecting intensified and the first high values of gold were discovered in 1939. By 1940, sufficient work had been done to prove the existence of gold in the area and thirteen mining areas were later demarcated around what would become the town of Welkom.

===Development of the settlement===
[[File:Welkom Central Business District circa 1950.jpg|thumb|220x220px|left|Welkom Central Business District 1950]] Welkom officially came into being on 15 April 1947, six years after the first mining lease in the area was awarded to the St Helena Gold Mining Company, and was proclaimed a town on 23 July 1948. On 14 February 1968, after 21 years of existence, Welkom received city status, and celebrated this event with the opening of the Civic Centre by Mrs Martie du Plessis. The construction of this building commenced in 1964.

===Apartheid era===
During [[Apartheid]] in the years of segregation, the townships of Thabong and Bronville were established for black and [[Cape Coloureds|Coloured]] people, respectively.

On 8 December 1976, Welkom experienced an earthquake measuring 5.2 on the [[Richter magnitude scale]]. The most significant damage caused was the total collapse of a six-storey block of flats about 75 minutes after the event. Widespread damage to many other buildings was experienced throughout the city. Despite extensive damage to surface and underground mining structures, only four deaths occurred.<ref>{{cite web | title=An earthquake in Welkom, OFS, devastates the flat block Tempesthof. | website=South African History Online | date=2011-12-09 | url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/earthquake-welkom-ofs-devastates-flat-block-tempesthof | access-date=2023-02-04}}</ref>

During the decline of the Apartheid era, race relations were particularly problematic as many [[White South Africans]] felt threatened by the eventuality of a regime change. This was the main cause of the events that transpired on 13 May 1989, when the mayor, a Mr Gus Gouws, was [[tarred and feathered]] after officiating at a multiracial wheelchair marathon event. The National Party mayor ran foul of his White constituency when he proposed the opening of a taxi rank in the business district of Welkom.

Aggrieved residents of the city then sought to humiliate him to dissuade him from authorising the erection of the facility, by assaulting him and a security guard, while he was officiating at the event. Four men were arrested and charged with the assault.<ref>{{cite web | title=Mayor of Welkom, in the Free State, is tarred and feathered | website=South African History Online | date=1989-05-13 | url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/mayor-welkom-free-state-tarred-and-feathered | access-date=2023-02-04}}</ref>

===1990–present===
On 20 March 1990, Welkom was struck by a multi-vortex tornado which went through the suburbs. This tornado was part of a 240&nbsp;km long storm front and had a width of up to 1.7&nbsp;km. This weather event proved to be the most devastating recorded, from the financial and insurance point of view, in South Africa to date, destroying 4,000 homes.<ref name="vistanews.co.za">[http://www.vistanews.co.za Vista News]</ref><ref>Goliger A.M. Retief J.V.

On 26 September 1990, Welkom experienced a seismic event with a magnitude of 4.2, which resulted in two deaths and five injuries.<ref name="vistanews.co.za"/>

The mining company [[Pamodzi Gold]] applied for bankruptcy in 2009 even though it was sitting atop one of the richest and consistently-producing gold veins in the world. The gold mine, President Steyn, was previously owned by the Thistle Mining Co., up until February 2008, and reported a total sale of 487,069 troy ounces of gold from 2004 to 2006. On 29 October 2007, Thistle Gold Mining entered into a 'Sale of Shares and Claims Agreement' under the South African government's [[black economic empowerment]] laws, under which Thistle's direct and indirect interests were sold to Pamodzi Gold for $14-million. In 2010, Harmony Gold subsequently acquired President Steyn from the now liquidated Pamodzi Gold and resumed operations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2010-11-19-pamodzi-mine-liquidators-slug-it-out |title=Pamodzi mine liquidators slug it out |date=19 November 2010 |work=Mail & Guardian |access-date=28 August 2014}}</ref> In 2023, [[Welkom mining explosion|an explosion]] at an [[illegal mine]] killed about 30 people.

==Geography==
===Topography===
[[File:Koppie Alleen.jpg|thumb|220x220px|right|Koppie Alleen]] Koppie Alleen is the only hill near Welkom and therefore is aptly named for its oddity. The terrain elevation above sea level is 1435 metres. The largest water catchment is the [[Sand River (Free State)|Sand River]] to the south-east of Welkom in Virginia's direction. Large saline pans such as Flamingo Pan and Theronia Pan are situated to the south-west of Welkom. Flamingo Pan is coded as an Important Bird Area (IBA)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cwac.adu.org.za/site_information.php?site=28002641&spp=86|title=CWAC &#124; Registered CWAC sites listing}}</ref>

===Streetscape===
Welkom is well known for its efficient road traffic design mainly through the use of traffic circles, which has been the basis of worldwide studies.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sa-venues.com/attractionsfs/welkom.php|title=Welkom|website=www.sa-venues.com}}</ref> This is encouraged by flow design, the minimum of stop streets and the total absence of traffic lights and parking meters in the Central Business District. There are currently 33 large traffic circles.

===Monuments and public art===
Welkom has several monuments including: 
* Aandenk Monument – This borehole memorial is shaped in the form of a key and symbolises the unlocking of the Free State goldfields.(next to Allanridge)
* Afrikaans Language Monument
* Joanne Pim Monument
* WWII Monument
* Voortrekker Memorial
* Dog Monument
* Old Indaba Bluegum Tree
* MOTH Memorial
* Gold Museum – A complete history of gold and its mining and production was on display. St Helena Gold Mine is not a working mine any more. Until a few years ago It was still possible to visit the mine and its wine cellar at 857m below surface but it does not exist any more. 
* Museum of Welkom – The public library houses a display of the discovery of gold in Welkom, the town's history and bird and animal life indigenous to this region.
* Local Apartheid Memorial – commemorating local citizen's contribution to the Struggle in the [[Apartheid in South Africa|Apartheid]] years.

===Climate===
Welkom normally receives about 401&nbsp;mm to 550&nbsp;mm of rain per year, dependent on wet or dry cycles, with most rainfall occurring mainly during mid-summer. It receives the lowest rainfall (0&nbsp;mm) in July and the highest (70&nbsp;mm) in January. The monthly distribution of average daily maximum temperatures ranges from 17&nbsp;°C in June to 29&nbsp;°C in January. The region is the coldest during July when the mercury drops to 0&nbsp;°C on average during the night.

===Flora and fauna===
[[File:Flamingos over Lakeview, Welkom.jpg|thumb|220x220px|right|Flamingos over Lakeview]] Welkom is situated on two vegetation units, the Western Free State Clay Grassland and Vaal-Vet Sandy Grassland, these are differentiated by soil types, rainfall and frost.<ref>{{Citation | editor1=Low, A.B.  | editor2=Rebelo, A.G. | year=1996 | title=Vegetation of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland | location=Pretoria | publisher=DEAT}}</ref> The dominant grass species are ''[[Hyparrhenia hirta]]'', ''[[Themeda triandra]]'', ''[[Sporobolus]] pyramidalis'', ''[[Eragrostis]]'' sp, ''[[Aristida]]'' sp, and other grasses and herbs. Trees and shrubs are infrequent due to heavy frost in the winter months.

The grasslands surrounding Welkom also include small mammal communities of [[yellow mongoose]], [[ground squirrel]], [[Cape porcupine]], [[African mole rat|African mole-rat]], [[pouched mouse]], large-eared mouse, four-stripe grass mouse, and multimammate mouse. The De Rust Private Nature Reserve<ref>[http://www.de-rust.co.za/ De Rust Private Nature Reserve Homepage]</ref> is situated about 25&nbsp;km from Welkom on the [[Kroonstad]] road and is registered with the Free State Department of Nature Conservation.

===Local geology: gold-bearing reefs===
Welkom is located on the south-western corner of the [[Witwatersrand Basin]]. This basin situated on the [[Kaapvaal Craton]],<ref>James, D.E. Niu, F. Rokosky, J. Crustal structure of the Kaapvaal craton and its significance for early crustal evolutiona, Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, Carnegie Institution of Washington, 5241 Department of Earth Science, Rice University, Houston, TX 77251, USA</ref> is filled by a 6-kilometre thick succession of [[sedimentary rocks]], which extends laterally for hundreds of kilometres.<ref>Phillips G.N. Widespread fluid infiltration during metamorphism of the Witwatersrand goldfields: generation of chloritoid and pyrophyllite, Department of Geology, University of the Witwatersrand, 1988</ref>

====The De Bron Fault====
The Free State Goldfields are divided into two sections,<ref>Dwyer, G. The geology of the Welkom Goldfields with special reference to the A, B and Beatrix reefs, Rhodes University, 1993</ref> cut by the north–south striking De Bron Fault. This major structure has a vertical displacement of about 1500m as well as a lateral shift of 4&nbsp;km. A number of other major faults lie parallel to the De Bron Fault. Dips occur mostly towards the east, averaging 30 degrees but this becomes steeper approaching the De Bron Fault. To the east of the fault, a dip occurs towards the west at 20 degrees, although structurally complex dips of up to 40 degrees have also been measured. Between these two blocks, lies the uplifted [[Horst (geology)|horst]] block of the West Rand Group of sediments with no reef preserved.<ref>[http://www.financialresults.co.za/2013/harmony_ir2013/harmony_mr2013/4-free-state.php Mineral resources and mineral reserves 2013 | Free State operations]</ref>

The western margin area is bound by [[syncline]]s and [[reverse thrust]]s faults and is structurally complex. Towards the south and east, reefs sub-crop against overlying [[Strata (geology)|strata]], eventually cutting out against the [[Karoo]] to the east of the area. Most of the ore resource tends to be concentrated in [[Vein (geology)|reef bands]] located on one or two distinct unconformities. Mining has taken place as mostly deep-level underground, exploiting the narrow, generally shallow dipping tabular reefs.

[[File:Harmony Gold mine shaft on R30 to Odensdaalsrus.jpg|thumb|220x220px|right|Harmony Gold Mine shaft on R30]]

====Basal Reef====
The Basal Reef, is the most common reef horizon. It varies from a single pebble lag to channels of more than 2m thick. It is commonly overlain by shale, which thickens northwards.

====Leader Reef====
The second major reef is the Leader Reef, located 15-20m above the Basal Reef. This is mostly mined at shafts to the south. Further north, it becomes poorly developed with erratic grades. The reef consists of multiple [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] units, separated by thin [[quartzitic]] zones, often totalling up to 4 metres thick.

A selected mining cut on the most economic horizon is often undertaken. The B Reef is a highly channelised ore-body located 140m [[stratigraphical]]ly above the Basal Reef. Within the channels, grades are excellent, but this falls away to nothing, outside of the channels. The A Reef is also a highly channelised reef, located some 40m above the B Reef. It consists of multiple conglomerate bands of up to 4m thick and a selected mining cut is usually required to optimise the ore-body.

====Fossils of Matjhabeng====
A 2007 palaeontological study done in greater Matjhabeng began a programme of excavation of an early [[Pliocene]] locality. With an estimated age of 4.0–3.5 Ma, the locality also represents the only well-documented, river-deposited Pliocene locality in the central interior of southern Africa. After three years of excavation, a diverse fauna that includes fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals was recovered. Mammals ranged in size from rodents to [[mammoths]], including an array of [[proboscideans]], [[perissodactyls]] and [[artiodactyls]], alongside rare carnivores.
 
In total, 29 taxa, including the oldest [[Ancylotherium]] and [[Megalotragus]] fossils in southern Africa were recovered. Some of the taxa from Matjhabeng are shared with [[Langebaanweg]], and others with [[Makapansgat]], confirming the intermediate status of this locality. Isotopic analysis revealed the earliest indication of extensive grasslands in South Africa, though these grasslands were part of an environmental mosaic that included significant woodland, and probable wetland, components.<ref>D.J.; Brophy, J.K.; Lewis, P.J.; Kennedy, A.M.; Stidham, T.A.; Carlson, K.B.; Hancox, P. John, 2010: Preliminary investigation of Matjhabeng, a Pliocene fossil locality in the Free State of South Africa. Palaeontologia Africana 45</ref>

==Demographics==
According to the [[South African National Census of 2011|2011 census]], Welkom proper had a population of 64,130 people in an area of {{convert|167.55 |sqkm}}, a population density of {{convert|382.76|PD/sqkm}}.<ref name=census2011 /> 60.7% of the inhabitants described themselves as "[[Bantu peoples in South Africa|Black African]]", 26.9% as "[[White South African|White]]", 11.1% as "[[Coloured]]" and 0.9% as "[[Indian South African|Indian]] or [[Asian South African|Asian]]".<ref name=census2011 />

==Economy==
===Mining===
====Gold and uranium====
[[File:Harmony Phakisa Shaft.jpg|thumb|220x220px|left|Harmony Phakisa shaft]] Welkom's economy centres on the mining of gold and [[uranium]] and is the hub of the Free State Goldfields. Welkom has contributed 21% to the free world's gold sales.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The city and immediate surroundings are dominated by the headgears and reduction plants of several gold and uranium mining companies, including St Helena, Unisel, Welkom, Western Holdings, Free State Geduld, President Brand, President Steyn, Erfdeel Dankbaarheid, Phakisa,<ref>[http://www.harmony.co.za Harmony | Home]</ref> and Tshepong.

=====Recent discoveries=====
In Sept 2016 Harmony Gold and its partner White Rivers Exploration declared an as to then unknown gold ore body near the current Target shaft. This resource is estimated to have a mine life of about 30 years.
<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.miningreview.com/news/white-rivers-exploration-defines-massive-gold-resource-harmony|title = White Rivers Exploration defines massive gold resource|date = 8 September 2016}}</ref>

====Coal====
Welkom also has significant coal reserves. The Theunissen coal field is located in the districts of [[Theunissen]] and Bultfontein, only some 12&nbsp;km to the south of Welkom. The section of the reserve able to be mined covers an area of more than 23,500 hectares.<ref>McCarthy, T. S. Pretorius, J. P. Coal mining on the Highveld and its implications for future water
quality in the Vaal River system, School of Geosciences, University of the Witwatersrand</ref>

====Diamonds====
Located about 7.5&nbsp;km from Welkom, a [[kimberlite]] pipe, was discovered in 1890 and mined from a single shaft until the start of the [[Boer War]] in 1899. Mining continued after the war until a major aquifer, which was encountered at a depth of 259m, forced the mine to close. It was eventually re-opened by Samada Diamonds Pty Ltd and closed again in the early 1990s.

Petra Diamonds operated the Star mine, a fissure 40&nbsp;km south of Welkom. The Star mine was renowned for its consistent production of high value diamonds. In 2013, Petra commenced a disposal process of its Fissure Mines portfolio. This process did not result in any acceptable offers for the mines and Star was subsequently placed into care and maintenance.

====Other minerals====
Other minerals found in the Welkom vicinity include [[calcite]], [[iridium]], isoferroplatinum, [[muscovite]], [[pyrophylite]], [[rutile]] and [[uranite]].

===Industry===
Due to the declining gold price in the nineties, the manufacturing industry was promoted as a further means to support the local economy. Heavy machinery support for mining can be found in the Voorspoed area. Various other maintenance industries and services are well founded in Welkom which include engineering, and mechanical repairs.

[[File:Maize production near the R34 Welkom.jpg|thumb|220x220px|right|Maize production near the R34 leading into Welkom]]
Welkom produces goods such as steel, lumber, dairy products, and beef.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://matjhabengpublicity.co.za/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006062321/http://matjhabengpublicity.co.za/| archive-date=2017-10-06 | title=Melkkan / 2dag / SURVIVOR VAKANSIE PROGRAM / 5-7 April 2017 / 12-14 April 2017| access-date=2023-11-04| language=af}}</ref>

The city also hosts several major industries such as [[Coca-Cola]] and [[South African Breweries]].

===Agriculture===
The high water table in the north-western part of the district makes it very suitable for maize production and should remain an important maize producing area. The district is mostly covered by non-arable, moderate potential grazing land as well as marginal potential arable land.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ard.fs.gov.za/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LEJWELEPUTSWA-PROFILE.pdf | access-date=2023-11-04| title=AGRICULTURAL LAND AND PROJECTS/PROGRAMME/SUPPORT PROFILE}}</ref> The Welkom region forms part of the Maize Triangle, which stretches over three of South Africa's provinces. The region is also a major producer of sunflowers, poultry and beef cattle.
