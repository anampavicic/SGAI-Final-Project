'''Ondjiva''', formerly '''Vila Pereira d'Eça''', is a [[List of cities and towns in Angola|town]], with a population of 121,537 (2014),<ref>[https://www.citypopulation.de/en/angola/cities/ Citypopulation.de] Population of the major cities in Angola</ref> and a [[Communes of Angola|commune]] in the municipality of [[Cuanhama]], province of [[Cunene Province|Cunene]], [[Angola]]. It is also the administrative capital of [[Cunene Province]] and is located at the extreme south of the country, about {{convert|42|km|mi}} from the border with Namibia. It was traditionally the seat of the [[Owambo people|Ovambo]] king of the [[Oukwanyama]] tribe. Ondjiva was greatly affected by the [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975-2002).<ref name="a"/>

==History==

===Mission station===

The Ondjiva [[mission station]] was established first in 1891 by [[Friedrich Meisenholl]] and [[August Wulfhorst]] of the [[Rhenish Mission Society]], and with the help of [[Friedrich Bernsmann]] and with the permission of King [[Weyulu Hedimbi]]. They thought that Ondjiva would have been in the territory of [[German South West Africa]], which later turned out not to be the case. The following year they established the mission station of [[Omupanda]].

Meisenholl stayed in Ondjiva for some four years, before he had to leave due to a serious illness. Wilhelm Stahlhut came to replace him in the mid-1890s. Stahlhut’s three children died in Africa, and finally he himself fell ill with [[blackwater fever]] and died in [[Outjo]] on 1 May 1900. His widow stayed for many years, first in Oukwanyama and then in [[Hereroland]].

In August 1915, King Mandume had the mission station burned, and the Germans had to flee to [[Ondonga]] in [[South West Africa]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Sata vuotta suomalaista lähetystyötä 1859–1959.

Ondjiva later became a Catholic mission and the see of the [[bishop]] of the [[Ondjiva Diocese]]. [[Fernando Guimaraes Kevanu]] was the bishop until 2011, and he was to be succeeded by Rev. [[Pio Hipunyati]].<ref name="fides" />

===Angolan Civil War===

Ondjiva was largely destroyed during the [[Angolan Civil War]]. The administration of the city operated from [[Huíla Province]], and in theory ruled Cunene Province in exile. Most of the population left the city by 1989, and by 1999 was home to fewer than 5,000 residents. Reconstruction efforts began after the advent of peace in 2002. Ondjiva initially experienced slow population growth but saw a significant return of its residents and new migration from other regions of Angola, notably from Huíla Province from 1998 and 2000.<ref name="Rodrigues2007"/>

==Demographics==

Ondjiva has traditionally been a center of the [[Kwanyama dialect|Kwanyama]], Oshikwanyama being a standardized [[dialect]] of the [[Oshiwambo language]]. The resettlement of the city after the Angolan Civil War saw an influx of people from other areas of the country, notably [[Huíla Province]]. 30.4 per cent of the residents of the city speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], significantly lower than that in the capital of Luanda. 28.2 per cent of the population speak Kwanhama.<ref name="Rodrigues2007"/>
