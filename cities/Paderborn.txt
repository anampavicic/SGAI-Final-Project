'''Paderborn''' ({{IPA|de|paːdɐˈbɔʁn|-|Paderborn.ogg}}; [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]]: ''Patterbuorn'', also ''Paterboärn'')<ref name=Duden>{{cite web|title=Duden dictionary|url=http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Paderborn|access-date=7 December 2013}}</ref> is a city in eastern [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]], capital of the [[Paderborn (district)|Paderborn district]]. The name of the city derives from the river [[Pader (river)|Pader]] and ''Born'', an old German term for the source of a river. The river Pader originates in more than 200 springs near [[Paderborn Cathedral]], where [[St. Liborius]] is buried.

Paderborn ranks 55th on the [[List of cities in Germany by population]].

==History==
Paderborn was founded as a [[bishopric]] by [[Charlemagne]] in 795, although its official history began in 777 when Charlemagne built a castle near the Paderborn springs.<ref name="Heribert Zelder 2009">Ed. Heribert Zelder,  Tourist Information Services,  ''Welcome to Paderborn'',  Stadt Paderborn:  Paderborn, Germany, 2009.</ref> In 799 [[Pope Leo III]] fled his enemies in [[Rome]] and reached Paderborn, where he met Charlemagne, and stayed there for three months. It was during this time that it was decided that Charlemagne would be crowned emperor. Charlemagne reinstated Leo in Rome in 800 and was crowned as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] by Leo in return. In 836, [[Liborius of Le Mans|St. Liborius]] became the patron saint of Paderborn after his bones were moved there from [[Le Mans]] by Bishop Badurad.<ref name="ReferenceA">Ed. Heribert Zelder,  Tourist Information Services,  Welcome to Paderborn,  Stadt Paderborn:  Paderborn, Germany, 2009.</ref> St. Liborius is commemorated in Paderborn every year in July with the Liborifest. The [[Bishopric of Paderborn|bishop of Paderborn]], Meinwerk, became a [[Prince of the Empire]] in 1100. The bishop had several large buildings built, and the area became a place for the emperors to stay.<ref name="Heribert Zelder 2009" /> [[File:Paderborn-Kupferstich-Merian.png|thumb|left|250px|Paderborn in 1647.]]

The city was taken by [[Prussia]] in 1802, then by the [[France|French]] [[vassal state]] [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] from 1807 to 1813 and then returned to Prussia.

Native [[Friedrich Sertürner]], a pharmacist's apprentice in Paderborn, was the first to isolate [[morphine]] from [[opium]] in 1804.

In 1914 the Paderborn military camp was turned into a prisoner of war camp named ''[[Sennelager]]''.

In 1930, the See of Paderborn was promoted to [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Paderborn|archdiocese]].

{{anchor|Allied air attacks}}During [[World War II]], Paderborn was bombed by Allied aircraft in 1944 and 1945, resulting in 85% destruction, including many of the historic buildings. It was seized by the US [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] after a pitched [[Battle of Paderborn (1945)|battle]] 31 March – 1 April 1945, in which tanks and [[flamethrower]]s were used during combined mechanized-infantry assaults against the city's southwestern, southern and southeastern approaches.<ref>Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939–1946'' (Revised Edition, 2006), p. 52</ref>

After the city was reconstructed in the 1940s and 1950s, Paderborn became a major industrial seat in Westphalia.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The British Army retained a significant presence in the area until 2020, when British units were relocated back to the United Kingdom. Only a small training and enabling staff remain at Paderborn to facilitate temporary deployments to use the [[Sennelager Training Area]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The British Army in Germany |url=https://www.army.mod.uk/deployments/germany/ |website=British Army |access-date=26 June 2021}}</ref>

On May 20, 2022, Paderborn was hit by a damaging [[tornado]], leaving 38 injured & considerable damage along its path.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi?lang=en_0&lastquery=1743204550&force_static_map=true%3B |title=European Severe Weather Database |website=eswd.eu |access-date=25 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220520174425/https://eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi?lang=en_0&lastquery=1743204550&force_static_map=true%3B |archive-date=20 May 2022 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.westfalen-blatt.de/owl/kreis-paderborn/tornado-verwustet-paderborn-38-verletzte-ein-opfer-schwebt-in-lebensgefahr-2575222 | title=Tornado verwüstet Paderborn: 43 Verletzte – ein Opfer schwebt in Lebensgefahr }}</ref>
