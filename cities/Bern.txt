Bern is also the capital of the [[canton of Bern]], the second-most populous of [[Cantons of Switzerland|Switzerland's cantons]]. The official language is [[German language|German]],<ref group=note>The official language in any municipality in German-speaking Switzerland is always German. In this context, the term 'German' is used as an umbrella term for any variety of German. So, according to law, people are allowed to communicate with the authorities by using any kind of German, in written or oral form. However, the authorities will always use [[Swiss Standard German]] (aka the Swiss variety of [[Standard German]]) in documents, or any written form. And orally, it is either ''Hochdeutsch'' (i.e., Swiss Standard German or what the particular speaker considers as ''High German''), or then it depends on the speaker's origin, which dialectal variant they are using.</ref> but the main spoken language is the local variant of the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] [[Swiss German]] dialect, [[Bernese German]]. In 1983, the [[Old City (Bern)|historic old town]] (in {{langx|de|Altstadt}}) in the centre of Bern became a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Old City of Berne |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/267 |website=UNESCO World Heritage List |publisher=UNESCO |access-date=4 January 2019 |archive-date=2 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302170808/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/267 |url-status=live }}</ref> It is notably surrounded by the [[Aare]], a major river of the [[Swiss Plateau]].

Although fortified settlements were established since antiquity, the medieval city proper was founded by the [[Zähringer]] ruling family, probably in 1191 by [[Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen]]. Bern was made a [[free imperial city]] in 1218 and, in 1353, it joined the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]], becoming one of its eight early cantons. Since then, Bern became a large [[city-state]] and a prominent actor of Swiss history by pursuing a policy of sovereign territorial expansion. Since the 15th century, the city was progressively rebuilt and acquired its current characteristics. Bern was made the Federal City in 1848. From about 5,000 inhabitants in the 15th century, the city passed the 100,000 mark in the 1920s.

== Etymology ==
{{Hatnote|See also [[Names of European cities in different languages: B|Other names of Bern]]}}
The etymology of the name "Bern" is uncertain. According to the local legend, based on [[folk etymology]], [[Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen]], the founder of the city of Bern, vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt, and this turned out to be a bear. It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of [[Verona]], which at the time was known as ''Bern'' in [[Middle High German]]. The city was sometimes referred to as ''Bern im [[Üechtland]]'' to distinguish it from Verona.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://hls-dhs-dss.ch/de/articles/008562/2013-11-13/ |title=Üchtland |last1=Müller |first1=Wulf |last2=Tremp |first2=Ernst |date=13 November 2013 |website=[[Historical Dictionary of Switzerland]] |access-date=5 August 2020 |archive-date=11 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201111083752/https://hls-dhs-dss.ch/de/articles/008562/2013-11-13/ |url-status=live }}</ref> As a result of the finding of the [[Bern zinc tablet]] in the 1980s, it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin, possibly ''*berna'' "cleft".<ref>Andres Kristol (ed.): Lexikon der schweizerischen Gemeindenamen. Huber, Frauenfeld 2005, {{ISBN|3-7193-1308-5}}, p. 143.</ref> The bear was the heraldic animal of the [[Coat of arms of Bern|seal and coat of arms of Bern]] from at least the 1220s. The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the ''[[Bärengraben]]'' dates to the 1440s.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Bern}}
{{For timeline}}

=== Early history ===
[[File:Untertorbrücke Tschachtlanchronik.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Construction of the [[Untertorbrücke]] (Lower Gate Bridge) in Bern, [[Tschachtlanchronik]], late 15th century]]

No [[archaeological]] evidence that indicates a settlement on the site of today's city centre prior to the 12th century has been found so far. In antiquity, a [[Celts|Celtic]] ''[[oppidum]]'' stood on the ''Engehalbinsel'' (peninsula) north of Bern, fortified since the second century BC (late [[La Tène period]]), thought to be one of the 12 ''oppida'' of the [[Helvetii]] mentioned by [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Caesar]]. During the [[Germania Superior|Roman era]], a [[Gallo-Roman]] ''[[vicus]]'' was on the same site. The Bern zinc tablet has the name ''Brenodor'' ("dwelling of Breno"). In the Early Middle Ages, a settlement in [[Bümpliz]], now a city district of Bern, was some {{convert|4|km|0|abbr=on}} from the medieval city.

The medieval city is a foundation of the [[Zähringer]] ruling family, which rose to power in [[Upper Burgundy]] in the 12th century. According to 14th-century historiography (''Cronica de Berno'', 1309), Bern was founded in 1191 by [[Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen]].

In 1218, after Berthold died without an heir, Bern was made a [[free imperial city]] by the ''[[Goldene Handfeste]]'' of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].

=== Old Swiss Confederacy ===
In 1353, Bern joined the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]], becoming the eighth canton of the formative period of 1353 to 1481.

Bern invaded and conquered [[Aargau]] in 1415 and [[Vaud]] in 1536, as well as other smaller territories, thereby becoming the largest [[city-state]] north of the [[Alps]]. By the 18th century, it comprised most of what is today the [[canton of Bern]] and the [[canton of Vaud]].

[[File:MerianBern.jpg|thumb|left|Bern in 1638]]
The city grew out towards the west of the boundaries of the peninsula formed by the river [[Aare]]. The ''[[Zytglogge]]'' tower marked the western boundary of the city from 1191 until 1256, when the ''Käfigturm'' took over this role until 1345. It was succeeded by the ''[[Christoffelturm]]'' (formerly located closer to the site of the modern-day railway station) until 1622. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], two new fortifications – the so-called big and small ''[[Schanze]]'' (entrenchments) – were built to protect the whole area of the peninsula.

After a major blaze in 1405, the city's original wooden buildings were gradually replaced by [[half-timbered]] houses, and subsequently the [[sandstone]] buildings which came to be characteristic for the Old Town. Despite waves of [[Bubonic plague|pestilence]] that hit Europe in the 14th century, the city continued to grow, mainly due to [[immigration]] from the surrounding countryside.<ref>{{HDS|209|Bern: Development of the settlement and the population}}</ref>

During the 18th century, the city of Bern was at one point the largest shareholder in the [[South Sea Company]], a British [[joint-stock company]] which was involved in the [[Atlantic slave trade]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Illien |first=Noele |date=2020-11-19 |title=Banking and slavery: Switzerland examines its colonial conscience |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/19/banking-slavery-switzerland-examines-its-colonial-conscience |access-date=2023-11-15 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> From 1689 to 3 March 1798 in the town was printed, in [[French language|French]], the biweekly newspaper ''[[Gazette de Berne]]'', which reflected the opinions of Bern,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bertholet |first=Auguste |url=https://www.slatkine.com/fr/slatkine-reprints-erudition/75939-book-07102939-9782051029391.html |title=La Physiocratie et la Suisse |last2=Kapossy |first2=Béla |publisher=Slatkine |year=2023 |isbn=9782051029391 |location=Geneva |language=fr}}</ref> usually hostile to the politics of [[Pre-revolutionary France]].<ref>{{HDS|043041|author=Ernst Bollinger|Gazette de Bern}}</ref>

=== Modern history ===
[[File:Johann Heinrich Müller, 1825-1894 H01b Bern.JPG|thumb|left|Bern c.&nbsp;1870.<br>Etching by [[commons:Category:Johann Heinrich Müller (1825-1894)|Heinrich Müller]]]]
Bern was occupied by [[First French Republic|French]] troops in 1798 during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], when it was stripped of parts of its territories. It regained control of the [[Bernese Oberland]] in 1802, and following the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814, it newly acquired the [[Bernese Jura]]. At this time, it once again became the largest canton of the Confederacy as it stood during the [[Restoration (Switzerland)|Restoration]] and until the secession of the [[canton of Jura]] in 1979.

On 28 November 1848, a majority of the new Swiss [[Federal Assembly of Switzerland|Federal Assembly]] deputies chose Bern as the [[Federal City]] (seat of the government) of the newly created [[Switzerland as a federal state|Swiss federal state]], ahead of [[Zürich]] and [[Lucerne]]. Bern was chosen as not to concentrate all the power in the economic powerhouse of Zürich, while Catholic and conservative Lucerne had been part of the [[Sonderbund War|Sonderbund]] during the war a year before. In addition, Bern had a more central location and was supported by the French-speaking cantons due to proximity to them. However, the constitution doesn't define Bern as official capital of Switzerland, but as the seat of government.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Stephens) |first=(Translated from French by Thomas |title=Why is Bern the capital of Switzerland? |url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/-federal-city-_why-is-bern-the-capital-of-switzerland-/44577476 |access-date=2023-04-25 |website=SWI swissinfo.ch |date=28 November 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

A number of congresses of the [[socialist]] [[First International|First]] and [[Second International]]s were held in Bern, particularly during [[World War I]] when Switzerland was neutral; see [[Bern International]].

The city's population rose from about 5,000 in the 15th century to about 12,000 by 1800 and to above 60,000 by 1900, passing the 100,000 mark during the 1920s. Population peaked during the 1960s at 165,000 and has since decreased slightly, to below 130,000 by 2000. As of September 2017, the resident population stood at 142,349, of which 100,000 were Swiss citizens and 42,349 (31%) resident foreigners. A further estimated 350,000 people live in the immediate [[urban agglomeration]].<ref>municipal statistics,[http://www.bern.ch/leben_in_bern/stadt/statistik/in_kuerze] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222114804/http://www.bern.ch/leben_in_bern/stadt/statistik/in_kuerze|date=22 December 2010}} includes 6,816 weekend commuters not included in the federal statistics of 123,466.{{cite web |title=Statistik Schweiz - Aktuellste Daten |url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/02/blank/dos/result.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126162846/http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/02/blank/dos/result.html |archive-date=26 November 2010 |access-date=8 December 2010}}</ref>

Bern lies on the [[Swiss plateau]] in the canton of Bern, slightly west of the centre of Switzerland and {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the [[Bernese Alps]]. The countryside around Bern was formed by glaciers during the most recent [[ice age]]. The two mountains closest to Bern are [[Gurten (mountain)|Gurten]] with a height of {{convert|864|m|0|abbr=on}} and [[Bantiger]] with a height of {{convert|947|m|0|abbr=on}}. The site of the old observatory in Bern is the point of origin of the [[Swiss coordinate system|CH1903 coordinate system]] at {{Coord|46|57|08.66|N|7|26|22.50|E|region:CH_type:landmark}}.

The city was originally built on a hilly [[peninsula]] surrounded by the river [[Aare]], but outgrew natural boundaries by the 19th century. A [[List of Aar bridges in Bern|number of bridges]] have been built to allow the city to expand beyond the Aare.

Bern is built on very uneven ground. An elevation difference of up to 60 metres exists between the inner city districts on the Aare ([[Mattequartier|Matte]], [[Marzili, Bern|Marzili]]) and the higher ones (Kirchenfeld, Länggasse).

Bern has an area, {{as of|2013|lc=on}}, of {{convert|51.62|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Of this area, {{convert|9.42|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} or 18.2% is used for agricultural purposes, while {{convert|17.21|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} or 33.3% is forested.

Of the developed area of Bern, 3.1% consists of industrial buildings, 22.3% housing and other buildings, and 12.9% is devoted to transport infrastructure. Power and water infrastructure, as well as other special developed areas, made up 1.2% of the city, while another 6.5% consists of parks, green belts, and sports fields.

Of Bern's total land area, 32.8% is heavily forested. Of the agricultural land, 13.3% is used for growing crops and 4.4% is designated to be used as pasture. Local rivers and streams provide all the water in the municipality.<ref name=BFS_land/>

== Politics ==

=== Subdivisions ===
The municipality is administratively subdivided into six districts (''Stadtteile''), each of which consists of several quarters (''Quartiere'').

{{See also|List of mayors of Bern}}
{{See also|Gemeinderat (Bern)}}

The Municipal Council (de: '''Gemeinderat''', fr: '''conseil municipal''') constitutes the [[executive (government)|executive]] government of the City of Bern and operates as a [[collegiate authority]]. It is composed of five councillors ({{langx|de|Gemeinderat/-rätin}}, {{langx|fr|conseiller/conseillère municipal(e)}}), each presiding over a directorate (de: ''Direktion'', fr: ''direction'') comprising several departments and bureaus. The president of the executive department acts as [[mayor]] (de: ''Stadtpräsident'', fr: ''Le Maire''). In the mandate period 2021–2024 (''Legislatur'') the Municipal Council is presided by ''Stadtpräsident'' [[Alec von Graffenried]]. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the City Council are carried by the Municipal Council. The regular election of the Municipal Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years. Any resident of Bern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council. Contrary to most other municipalities, the executive government in Bern is selected by means of a system of [[Proportional representation|Proporz]]. The mayor is elected as such as well by public election while the heads of the other directorates are assigned by the collegiate. The executive body holds its meetings in the [[Junkerngasse|Erlacherhof]], built by architect [[Albrecht Stürler]] after 1747.

{{As of|2021}}, Bern's Municipal Council is made up of two representatives of the SP ([[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democratic Party]]), and one each of CVP ([[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|Christian Democratic Party]]), GFL (''Grüne Freie Liste'' a.k.a. Green Free List, who is the newly elected mayor since 2017), and GB ([[Grünes Bündnis Bern|Green Alliance of Bern]]), giving the left parties a very strong majority of four out of five seats. The last regular election was held on 29 November 2020.<ref name=election>{{cite web |url=https://www.bern.ch/themen/stadt-recht-und-politik/abstimmungen-und-wahlen/wahlen/gemeindewahlen-2020 |title=Gemeindewahlen 2020 |publisher=Stadtkanzlei, Stabsstelle des Gemeinderats, Stadt Bern |type=official site |language=de |location=Bern, Switzerland |date=2020-11-29 |access-date=2022-08-01 |archive-date=27 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220627150828/https://www.bern.ch/themen/stadt-recht-und-politik/abstimmungen-und-wahlen/wahlen/gemeindewahlen-2020 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The City Council (de: '''Stadtrat''', fr: '''Conseil de ville''') holds [[legislative power]]. It is made up of 80 members, with elections held every four years. The City Council decrees regulations and by-laws that are executed by the Municipal Council and the administration. The delegates are selected by means of a system of [[proportional representation]].

The sessions of the City Council are public. Unlike members of the Municipal Council, members of the City Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance.

The structure of Bern's [[Old City (Bern)|city centre]] is largely [[medieval]] and has been recognised by [[UNESCO]] as a Cultural [[World Heritage Site]]. Perhaps its most famous sight is the ''[[Zytglogge]]'' (Bernese German for "Time Bell"), an elaborate medieval clock tower with moving puppets. It also has an impressive 15th century [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cathedral, the ''[[Münster (Bern)|Münster]]'', and a 15th-century town hall. Thanks to {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=off}} of arcades, the old town boasts one of the longest covered shopping promenades in Europe.

Since the 16th century, the city has had a bear pit, the ''[[Bärengraben]]'', at the far end of the [[Nydeggbrücke]] to house its heraldic animals. The four bears are now kept in an open-air enclosure nearby, and two other young bears, a present by the Russian president, are kept in [[Dählhölzli]] zoo.<ref>{{cite news|title= City of bears receives Russian bruins|newspaper= swissinfo.ch|date= 16 September 2009|url= http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss_news/City_of_bears_receives_Russian_bruins.html?cid=1008832|access-date= 13 July 2010|archive-date= 5 January 2012|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120105171617/http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss_news/City_of_bears_receives_Russian_bruins.html?cid=1008832|url-status= live}}</ref>

The Federal Palace ([[Federal Palace of Switzerland|Bundeshaus]]), built from 1857 to 1902, which houses the [[Swiss Federal Assembly|national parliament]], government and part of the federal administration, can also be visited.

[[Albert Einstein]] lived in a flat at the [[Kramgasse]] 49, the site of the [[Einsteinhaus]], from 1903 to 1905, the year in which the [[Annus Mirabilis papers|''Annus Mirabilis'' papers]] were published.

The Rose Garden (''Rosengarten''), from which a scenic panoramic view of the medieval town centre can be enjoyed, is a well-kept Rosarium on a hill, converted into a park from a former cemetery in 1913.

There are [[List of fountains in Bern|eleven Renaissance allegorical statues]] on public fountains in the Old Town. Nearly all the 16th-century fountains, except the [[Zähringerbrunnen|Zähringer fountain]], which was created by [[Hans Hiltbrand]], are the work of the [[Fribourg]] master [[Hans Gieng]]. One of the more interesting fountains is the [[Kindlifresserbrunnen]] (Bernese German: ''Child Eater Fountain''), which is claimed to represent a Jew,<ref>[http://www.bern.ch/stadtrat/sitzungen/archiv/1998/980514n.pdf City Council of Bern minutes of the 14 May 1998 5:00PM session] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213224744/http://www.bern.ch/stadtrat/sitzungen/archiv/1998/980514n.pdf |date=13 February 2012 }} accessed 23 November 2008 {{in lang|de}}</ref> the Greek god [[Chronos]], or a [[Swabian-Alemannic-Fastnacht|Fastnacht]] figure meant to frighten disobedient children.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://digibiblio.unibe.ch/digibern/Chopin/Engine/Systematik/viewer.asp?KatalogID=1&ImgNum=285&ImgCount=8&RecordNr=18 |title=Hofer, 281 |access-date=21 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707004313/http://digibiblio.unibe.ch/digibern/Chopin/Engine/Systematik/viewer.asp?KatalogID=1&ImgNum=285&ImgCount=8&RecordNr=18 |archive-date=7 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
