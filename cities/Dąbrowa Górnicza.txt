'''Dąbrowa Górnicza''' ({{ipa|pl|dɔmˈbrɔva ɡurˈɲit͡ʂa|audio=Pl-Dąbrowa Górnicza.ogg}}) is a city in [[Zagłębie Dąbrowskie]], southern [[Poland]], near [[Katowice]] and [[Sosnowiec]]. It is located in eastern part of the [[Silesian Voivodeship]], on the Czarna Przemsza and [[Biała Przemsza]] rivers (tributaries of the [[Vistula River|Vistula]], see [[Przemsza]]).

Even though Dąbrowa Górnicza belongs to the historic province of [[Lesser Poland]], it now is situated in the Silesian Voivodeship. Dąbrowa Górnicza is one of the cities of the [[Katowice urban area]] (2.7&nbsp;million people), and within the greater [[Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area]] (5.2&nbsp;million people).<ref>[[European Spatial Planning Observation Network]] (ESPON){{cite web|url=http://www.espon.eu/mmp/online/website/content/projects/261/420/index_EN.html |title=Project 1.4.3 |access-date=28 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728052348/http://www.espon.eu/mmp/online/website/content/projects/261/420/index_EN.html |archive-date=28 July 2009 }}</ref> The population of the city itself as of December 2021 is 116,971.<ref name = population />

== Locality and districts ==
Dąbrowa Górnicza is the largest city of the province and the 9th largest in Poland in terms of territory, with total area of 188 square kilometers. The city lies among the hills, at 258 to 390 meters [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Dąbrowa Górnicza borders [[Będzin County]], [[Zawiercie County]], [[Olkusz County]] and the city of [[Sosnowiec]]. At the same time it borders the cities and towns of Sosnowiec, [[Będzin]], [[Siewierz]] and [[Sławków]]. 

The [[Toponomy|place name]] ''Dąbrowa'', is derived from the Polish word ''dąb'' ([[oak]]), and denotes an ''oak grove'', as the territory of the original village is believed to have been covered by oak forests during the early days of its existence. From the 19th century, the settlement grew to be an important coal-mining center, and its name was supplemented by the [[adjective]] ''Górnicza'' (which refers to mining) in 1919, to distinguish it from such towns, as [[Dąbrowa Tarnowska]] and [[Dąbrowa Białostocka]].

=== Districts ===
The city is divided into several districts: Antoniów, Błędów, Bugaj, Centrum, Dziewiąty, Gołonóg, Korzeniec, Kuźniczka Nowa, Łazy Błędowskie, Łęka, Łęknice, Łosień, Marianki, Mydlice, Okradzionów, Piekło, Ratanice, Reden, Sikorka, [[Strzemieszyce Małe]], [[Strzemieszyce Wielkie]], Trzebiesławice, Trzydziesty, [[Tucznawa]], [[Ujejsce]], [[Ząbkowice]]. From 1977–1984, the town of [[Sławków]] was a district of Dąbrowa Górnicza.

In the first half of the 18th century, ''Dąbrowa'' was a small [[Agriculture|agricultural]] settlement belonging to the [[Będzin]] parish of the [[Kraków Voivodeship (14th century – 1795)|Kraków Voivodeship]] in the [[Lesser Poland Province, Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Lesser Poland Province]] in the Kingdom of Poland. It was first mentioned on 25 July 1726, when the parish priest of Holy Trinity Church at Będzin noted a woman named Anna Lisowa from Dąbrowa. At the 1787 census of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kraków|Archdiocese of Kraków]], the settlement numbered 184 inhabitants. 

The districts of Dąbrowa, which for centuries had comprised separate villages, are much older. Trzebieszowice was first mentioned in the 12th century; Błędów was mentioned by Bishop of Kraków [[Iwo Odrowąż]] in the year 1220; Strzemieszyce and Ujejsce were mentioned in the 14th century; Gołonóg in the 15th century; and Ząbkowice was described by Polish historian [[Jan Długosz]] in the 15th century.

After the [[Third Partition of Poland]] (1795), Dąbrowa was annexed by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and incorporated into its newly formed province of [[New Silesia]]. The Prussians discovered rich deposits of coal here and the first coal mine was established by [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Reden]] in 1796. In 1799, first detailed map of this area was created, on which a settlement called ''Stara Dąbrowa'' is presented. It was located along a road from [[Kraków]] to [[Upper Silesia]]. The coal mine established by von Reden attracted workers, and a settlement was soon established around it. 

In 1807, Dąbrowa was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Polish [[Duchy of Warsaw]]. After the duchy's dissolution in 1815, it became part of [[Russian Partition|Russian-controlled]] [[Congress Poland]]. In 1846, the ''Cieszkowski Coal Mine'' was opened, named after [[Józef Cieszkowski]]. The ''Zinc Plant Konstanty'' operated as early as 1823, and the ''Huta Bankowa'' steel works, which is still in operation, was built in Dąbrowa Górnicza in 1834. 

The first primary school was opened in 1820, and first Roman Catholic church of St. Alexander was built in the 1870s. 

During the [[January Uprising]], in February 1863, Dąbrowa was captured by Polish insurgents after their victory in the [[Battle of Sosnowiec]] nearby.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://twojezaglebie.pl/powstanie-styczniowe-zaglebiu/|title=Powstanie styczniowe w Zagłębiu.

In 1909, the [[gmina]] of Dąbrowa Górnicza was established by [[Tsar]]ist authorities. Even though its population reached 30,000, the Russians were reluctant to grant Dąbrowa town charter, so it remained a village until 18 August 1916, when Austrian authorities, which during [[World War I]] occupied southern part of [[Congress Poland]], agreed to establish the town. After the war, in 1918, Poland regained independence and control of the city. 15 local [[Polish Scouting and Guiding Association|Polish boy scouts]] were killed in fights for Polish independence in 1914–1920.<ref name=dpl/> In the [[Second Polish Republic]], Dąbrowa belonged to [[Kielce Voivodeship]].
