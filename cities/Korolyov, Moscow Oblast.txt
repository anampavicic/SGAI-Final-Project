'''Korolyov''' or '''Korolev''' ({{lang-rus|Королёв|p=kərɐˈlʲɵf}}) is an industrial [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] in [[Moscow Oblast]], [[Russia]], well known as the cradle of [[Soviet space program|Soviet]] and [[Roscosmos|Russian space exploration]]. As of the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census]], its population was 183,402, the largest as a science city.<ref name="2010Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}</ref> As of 2018, the population was more than 222,000 people.

It was known as '''Kaliningrad''' ({{lang|ru|Калинингра́д}}) from 1938 to 1996 and served as the leading Soviet center for production of [[anti-tank warfare|anti-tank]] and [[anti-aircraft warfare|air-defense]] guns. In 1946, in the aftermath of [[World War II]], the [[artillery]] plant was reconstructed for production of [[rocket]]s, [[launch vehicle]]s, and [[spacecraft]], under the guidance of Soviet scientist and academician [[Sergei Korolev]], who envisioned, consolidated and guided the activities of many people in the [[Soviet space program|Soviet space-exploration program]]. The plant later became known as the [[Energia (corporation)|RKK Energia]]; when the [[Vostok (spacecraft)|Vostok]] space vehicle was being developed, this research center was designated as [[NII-88]] or POB 989.

[[RKA Mission Control Center|Russian Mission Control Center]] is also located in Korolyov. Though the real control is decentralized due to security reasons and all space aircraft may be controlled from many different locations across Russia, the historic center of control is still in Korolev, and is called FCC – Flights Control Center.

In July 1996, the city was renamed in commemoration of [[Sergei Korolev]], the father of the Soviet/Russian space program, who died in 1966. Since 1997, Korolyov has hosted the [[International Space Olympics]], an annual competition for young people to promote space related research.

==History==
[[File:Expedition 55 Soyuz Docking (NHQ201803230003).jpg|thumb|left|The [[RKA Mission Control Center|Mission control center "ЦУП" ("TsUP")]] of the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]]]]
[[File:Evening panorama of Korolev.jpg|thumb|left|Springtime evening panorama towards the central part of the city]]

In the 12th century, a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] settlement was located on the site of modern Korolyov. The settlement stood on a junction of trade routes between the [[Moscow]] and [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] principalities. After the [[Mongol conquests]] in the 13th century, the region was in decline.

The village of Podlipki had formed on the site by the 18th century, when one of the first [[textile manufacturing|textile factories]] in Russia was established there.

From the late 19 century, Podlipki was also known as a [[dacha]] village frequented by [[#Notable people|many literali]], as can be witnessed by the name of [[Podlipki-Dachnye|Podlipki-Dachnye railway station]].{{cn|date=July 2023}} They later moved their dachas to [[Peredelkino]] in [[Moscow]]'s southeastern suburb, when Podlipki became a [[closed city]] of the [[Russian SFSR]].

In 1924, the first [[State Political Directorate|OGPU]] working commune in the [[Soviet Union]] was established at Podlipki. In 1938, the Kalininsky settlement near an [[artillery]] plant (which had previously been relocated from [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] to better protect it in case of any future war) was granted town status and named Kaliningrad (meaning Kalinin City, after Bolshevik leader [[Mikhail Kalinin]]; not to be confused with the [[Kaliningrad|Baltic port city also renamed Kaliningrad]] after Mikhail Kalinin in 1946). Over the next three decades the town expanded greatly as a home of [[rocket]] manufacturing for [[dual-use technology|both]] military [[missile]]s and the [[Soviet space program]]. As such it was a [[closed city]] to foreigners, who could not travel there.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is incorporated as '''Korolyov [[City of federal subject significance|City Under Oblast Jurisdiction]]'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Moscow Oblast|districts]].<ref name="Ref1406">Law #11/2013-OZ</ref> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], Korolyov City Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as '''Korolyov Urban Okrug'''.<ref name="Ref1535">Law #53/2014-OZ</ref>

In June 2014, [[Yubileyny, Moscow Oblast]] Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction was merged into Korolyov City Under Oblast Jurisdiction<ref name="Abolished">Law #54/2014-OZ. Additionally, the town of Yubileyny was struck from the ''Inventory Data of the Administrative-Territorial and Territorial Units of Moscow Oblast'' in August 2014.</ref> and on the municipal side, Yubileyny Urban Okrug was merged into Korolyov Urban Okrug.<ref name="Ref1535"/> The town of Yubileyny ceased to exist as an independent entity.<ref name="Abolished"/>

==Demographics==
{{Historical populations|5=1939|6=28122|7=1959|8=41427|9=1970|10=105945|11=1979|12=133470|13=1989|14=159363|15=2002|16=142568|17=2010|18=183402|19=2021|20=228095|type=|footnote=Source: Census data}}As of 1 January 2016, Korolyov was in 93 place out of 1112 cities in Russia based on demographics.

On 2 June 2014, the city of Yubileniy officially became a part of Korolyov. With a total population of 220 thousand people,<ref name="2010Census"/> Korolyov became the third largest city in Moscow Oblast based on population after [[Balashikha]] (428,400<ref name="2010Census"/>) and [[Khimki]] (239 967<ref name="2010Census"/>).

==Politics==
[[File:Adminkorolev7.jpg|thumb|City administration building]]
During the implementation of the [[:ru:Реформа местного самоуправления в России (2003—2009)|municipal reform]], by 1 January 2006, Korolyov was granted the status of the Korolyov urban district as the only settlement within it.

===Authorities===
On 14 September 2014, the candidate from the [[United Russia]] party, [[:ru:Ходырев, Александр Николаевич|Alexander Khodyrev]], was elected head of Korolyov.<ref name="khodirev">{{Cite web |url=http://www.korolev.ru/main/anews/news/23/4298.html |title=Главой города избран А. Н. Ходырев |trans-title=A. N. Khodyrev was elected head of the city |publisher=Official website of the Korolyov administration |access-date=2014-09-16 |archive-date=2015-12-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208091002/http://www.korolev.ru/main/anews/news/23/4298.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Economy==
The main enterprise of the city is the [[S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia|RKK Energia]], but there are several kinds of industry in the city. This [[naukograd]] (science city) is the place in which the first [[Youth Residential Complex]] in the Soviet Union was built. Another notable company located in the city is [[Joint-stock company|OAO]] [[Kompozit]], which is engaged in the field of materials science.

Today the city is prosperous overall. But in the [[economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet-era economy]], the city typified the wide contrasts and ironic juxtapositions that arose as some aspects of life were heavily funded by the government while others remained chronically underfunded. [[Yuri Krotkov]] described in his 1967 memoir<ref name="Krotkov_1967_76ff">{{Harvnb|Krotkov|1967|p=76 ff}}.</ref> how, at the same time that advanced technology was being built for space rockets, the textile plants of old Podlipki went on for decades with nearly no improvement on their 1920s equipment, and starkly impoverished workers in various hard and glamourless jobs of prerevolutionary days crossed paths, sometimes resentfully, with the skilled technicians and scientists, who were substantially better paid despite the slogans of [[ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet ideology]] around the equal dignity of [[manual labour]]ers.

==Sports==
The [[bandy]] club [[Vympel Korolyov|Vympel]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vimpel-bandy.ru/|title=На встречу к звёздам – Вымпел (хоккейный клуб)|work=vimpel-bandy.ru}}</ref> has played in the [[Russian Bandy Supreme League]], which is the second-highest division.<ref>[http://www.rusbandy.ru/800content.html?PageID=233 "КАЛЕНДАРЬ —игр Первенства России по хоккею с мячом среди команд первой лиги — на сезон 2008/09 г.г."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011024331/http://rusbandy.ru/800content.html?PageID=233 |date=October 11, 2007 }} (in [[Russian language]]).</ref> Their home arena has a capacity of 10 000.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Информация о стадионе "Вымпел", Королёв - Реестр - Федерация хоккея с мячом России|url=http://www.rusbandy.ru/stadium/39/|website=rusbandy.ru|access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref> A plan existed to equip the stadium with artificial ice,<ref>{{Cite web|title=В Королёве обсудили перспективы развития "Вымпела" - Архив новостей - Федерация хоккея с мячом России|url=http://www.rusbandy.ru/news/8922|website=rusbandy.ru|access-date=February 15, 2019}}</ref> but the project has been abandoned. Although an indoor ice hockey-sized arena entered the plans instead, the official reason given was financial problems.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Болельщики "Вымпела" просят поддержки - Архив новостей - Федерация хоккея с мячом России|url=http://www.rusbandy.ru/news/9285|website=rusbandy.ru|access-date=February 15, 2019}}</ref> Now Vympel only plays in the amateur league of [[Moscow Oblast]]. In 2014 a bandy federation for the city was founded.<ref>{{cite web|title=korolev-bandy.com|url=http://www.korolev-bandy.com/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722015042/http://www.korolev-bandy.com/|archive-date=July 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Notable people==
The area was a place of elite [[dacha]]s at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century. Many famous people, such as [[Konstantin Stanislavsky]], [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Valery Bryusov]], [[Boris Pasternak]], [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[Isaac Levitan]], [[Pavel Tretyakov]], [[Marina Tsvetaeva]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]], lived here.
