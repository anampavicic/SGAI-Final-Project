== Landmarks ==
Bawshar has been a central part of Muscat Governate and is home to many crucial landmarks for the country, starting with Sultan Qaboos Stadium which is the national stadium that hosts most international matches for football and other sports, as well as other events that require a high standard stadium. 

Another Landmark is Oil and Gas museum, which was opened in 1995, and it displayed the history of Oil and Gas extraction methods and the refinery that comes later through the history and how Oman has developed its methods of extraction and refinery.

Also there is Children's Museum, which is a futuristic museum for the modern scientific innovations and interesting discoveries and mechanisms, oversimplified for kids to understand them and take interest for them, Children's museum is an essential destination for school excursions where many kids start taking interest in science and get motivated to innovate and make a change in the country. 

== Bawsher Sands ==
Bawsher Sands are just spectacular to see, the formation of the dunes and the shades of colors are always mesmerizing to see, it is a common tourist attraction where you can even rent a buggy bike and display your skills (Safely of course). The best time to visit the sans is near sunset because the view at that time is beautiful to see and will make the person appreciate the nature and what is can have.
