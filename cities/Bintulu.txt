'''Bintulu''' is a coastal town on the island of [[Borneo]] in the central region of [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]]. Bintulu is located {{convert|610|km|mi|abbr=off}} northeast of [[Kuching]], {{convert|216|km|mi|abbr=off}} northeast of [[Sibu]], and {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=off}} southwest of [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]]. With a population of 114,058 as of 2010, Bintulu is the capital of the [[Bintulu District]] of the [[Bintulu Division]] of [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]].

The name of Bintulu was derived from the local native language "Mentu Ulau" (picking heads). Bintulu was a small fishing village when Rajah [[James Brooke]] acquired it in 1861. Brooke later built a fort there in 1862. In 1867, the first General Council meeting (now [[Sarawak State Legislative Assembly]]) was convened in Bintulu. It is the earliest state legislature system in Malaysia. The construction of the earliest airstrip in Bintulu began in 1934 but was halted in 1938 due to financial difficulties. During [[World War II]], the airstrip was heavily bombed by Allied forces. The British later rebuilt the airstrip, and it became fully operational in 1955. The old airport was replaced by a new airport in 2002. Bintulu remained a fishing village until 1969 when oil and gas reserves were discovered off the coast. Since then, Bintulu has become the centre of energy intensive industries such as a [[Malaysia LNG]] plant, a Shell [[Fischer–Tropsch process|Middle Distillate Synthesis]] plant, and a Bintulu [[Combined cycle|combined cycle power plant]]. The economy has also expanded into oil palm and forest plantations, [[palm oil]] processing, wood-waste processing, and cement manufacturing. The port of Bintulu is the busiest in Sarawak. The town is also a gateway to Samalajau Industrial Park.

Among the tourist attractions in Bintulu are [[Similajau National Park]], Tumbina Park, Tanjung Batu beach, Jepak village, Kuan Yin Tong temple, Assyakirin mosque, Council Negri monument, Tamu Bintulu, and Pasar Utama markets. The Borneo International Kite Festival is held annually in the town.

==Etymology==
During the 16th century, Bintulu was named "River de Burulu" by Portuguese [[cartographer]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Broek|first1=Jan O.M.|title=Place Names in 16th and 17th Century Borneo|journal=[[Imago Mundi]]|date=1962|volume=16|issue=1|page=132|doi=10.1080/03085696208592208|jstor=1150309|quote=Fig. 2. Borneo Place Names, 16th century – D.H. 1558: R. de burulu = Bintulu}}</ref> There are several legends surrounding the name Bintulu. During the Brooke dynasty, the indigenous practised [[headhunting]] to maintain their social status in the community. They threw the heads into the Kemena River, after which the heads had to be collected from the river. The practice of collecting the heads was known as "Metuk Ulow" (picking heads)<ref>{{cite news|title=Penyelidikan dan kajian dijalankan untuk mendokumentasi sejarah Bintulu (Research and studies conducted to document the history of Bintulu)|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2012/10/23/penyelidikan-dan-kajian-dijalankan-untuk-mendokumentasi-sejarah-bintulu/|access-date=5 June 2015|newspaper=The Borneo Post|date=23 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150605125502/http://www.theborneopost.com/2012/10/23/penyelidikan-dan-kajian-dijalankan-untuk-mendokumentasi-sejarah-bintulu/|archive-date=5 June 2015|language=ms}}</ref> in the local native language.<ref>{{cite book|last1=De Ledesma|first1=Charles|last2=Lewis|first2=Mark|last3=Savage|first3=Pauline|title=Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei|date=2003|publisher=[[Rough Guides]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hS0_GehsGPwC&pg=PA459|access-date=5 April 2016|page=459|quote=The name "Bintulu" is, in fact, derived from the Vaie "Metuk Ulow" – "the place for picking up heads"; before Bintulu was bought by Charles Brooke from the Sultan of Brunei in 1853, Melanau pirates preyed on the local coast, attacking passing ships and decapitating their crews.|isbn=9781843530947}}</ref> Another story relates that two Iban warriors named Berengik and Jaleb built houses along the river. They and their followers frequently carried out preservation of severed heads near a small river stream branching off from Sebezaw River because the river bank was flat and wide. Therefore, the small river stream was named "Metuk Ulow" river.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bintulu di hatiku – Sejarah (Bintulu in my heart – History)|url=http://catsfm.my/blogs/view/bintulu-di-hatiku|publisher=[[Cats FM]] blog|access-date=5 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150605124730/http://catsfm.my/blogs/view/bintulu-di-hatiku|archive-date=5 June 2015|language=ms}}</ref> Outsiders who came to Bintulu subsequently pronounced the name as "Mentulau", and later the name evolved into "Bentulu" and, finally, "Bintulu".<ref name=originofbintulu>{{cite web|title=Asal Usul Bintulu (The origin of Bintulu)|url=http://www.bintuluro.sarawak.gov.my/modules/web/pages.php?mod=webpage&sub=page&id=56&menu_id=0&sub_id=112|publisher=Bintulu Resident Office|access-date=17 June 2015}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

[[Odoardo Beccari]], an Italian botanist, visited Bintulu in 1867. On 4 August, he started his journey on a gunboat named "Heartsease", which was to send $6,000 to [[Brunei]] for concessions being made to James Brooke in the [[Mukah]] and Bintulu regions. He went to [[Labuan]] before coming back to Bintulu. He dropped off at Kemena River on 13 August 1867.

The houses of the Melanau people were built in rows on both sides of the Kemena River, mostly furnished by Nipah and [[Sago]] palms. Each house had its own shed projection into the entrance of the river, which was used for the processing of Sago palms.<ref name=Beccari/> On 8 September 1867, the first Sarawak General Council meeting (now [[Sarawak State Legislative Assembly]]) took place here.

The council was formed by Raja Muda Charles Brooke under orders from Rajah James Brooke.

===Japanese occupation===

During World War II, Rajah [[Charles Vyner Brooke]] ordered the construction of airstrips in Kuching, [[Oya, Sarawak|Oya]], Mukah, Bintulu, and [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]]. Construction of the Bintulu airstrip was started in 1934 under the direction of C.{{nbsp}}W. Bailey, a Works and Building Inspector for the British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).

In the 1950s, major economic activities in Bintulu were the timber extraction industry, fishing, and Sago processing. In the 1960s, Bintulu was still a small fishing village, with a population of 5,000. No roads were constructed in Bintulu until 1969 when the first untarred road was built to connect Bintulu to Miri. The first bus that serviced the Miri{{nsndns}}Bintulu route was owned by [[Majlis Amanah Rakyat]] (MARA). The MARA bus line was an initiative by the [[Malaysian federal government]] to provide public transportation for the people. The Iban villagers paid the bus driver with "vegetables, chickens, bamboo shoots, and other items".<ref name=oldbintulu/> Before 1960, Bintulu was connected to Kuching by sea through a ship named "Swee Joo". After 1960, the ship "Chin Chin" was added to the route. It took around 36 to 48 hours to reach Bintulu from Kuching, depending on the sea conditions. Due to lack of food supplies from Kuching, the villagers had to make do with limited food, and several villagers resorted to hunting in the jungles to supplement the food supply.<ref name=oldbintulu/>

In 1960 there were only three primary schools in Bintulu. These schools provided classes until Primary{{nbsp}}3 level. There were no secondary schools. Villagers could pursue their secondary school studies at either Miri or Kuching by using small boats as there were no roads connecting Bintulu to either Miri or Kuching. Bintulu Government Secondary School was opened in 1964.<ref name=oldbintulu/> In 1967 Bintulu celebrated the first 100 years of the Council Negri meeting (Sarawak State Legislative Assembly). A stone monument was built in front of a government rice storeroom to commemorate the event.<ref name=originofbintulu/> Bintulu was a sub-district of [[Miri Division]] in the 1970s.<ref name=oldbintulu/> The sub-district was upgraded into a district in 1987.<ref name=Bintuluro>{{cite web|title=Sejarah Penubuhan Pejabat Residen Bintulu (History of formation of Bintulu Resident Office|url=http://www.bintuluro.sarawak.gov.my/modules/web/pages.php?mod=webpage&sub=page&id=94&menu_id=0&sub_id=143|publisher=Bintulu Resident Office|access-date=17 June 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923185814/http://www.bintuluro.sarawak.gov.my/modules/web/pages.php?mod=webpage&sub=page&id=94&menu_id=0&sub_id=143|archive-date=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
