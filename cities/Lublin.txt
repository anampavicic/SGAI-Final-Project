It is the capital and the centre of [[Lublin Voivodeship]] with a population of 336,339 (December 2021).<ref name="population" /> Lublin is the largest Polish city east of the [[Vistula]] River, located {{convert|153|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Warsaw]].

One of the events that greatly contributed to the city's development was the [[Union of Krewo|Polish-Lithuanian Union of Krewo]] in 1385. Lublin thrived as a centre of trade and commerce due to its strategic location on the route between [[Vilnius]] and [[Kraków]]; the inhabitants had the privilege of free trade in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. The Lublin [[Sejm|Parliament]] session of 1569 led to the creation of a [[Union of Lublin|real union]] between the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]] and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, thus creating the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Lublin witnessed the early stages of the [[Reformation]] in the 16th century. A [[Calvinist]] congregation was founded and groups of radical [[Arians]] appeared in the city, making it an important global centre of [[Arianism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/lublin/3,local-history/?action=view|title=Local&nbsp;history - Information about the town - Lublin - Virtual Shtetl|access-date=20 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320232615/http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/lublin/3,local-history/?action=view|archive-date=20 March 2017}}</ref>

Until the [[Partitions of Poland|partitions at the end of the 18th century]], Lublin was a royal city of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. Its delegates and [[Szlachta|nobles]] had the right to participate in the [[Royal elections in Poland|royal election]]. In 1578, Lublin was chosen as the seat of the [[Crown Tribunal]], the highest [[appeal]] [[court]] in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and for centuries, the city has been flourishing as a centre of culture and higher learning.

In 2011, the analytical [[Financial Times Group]] found Lublin to be one of the best cities for business in Poland.<ref>lublin.eu (21 February 2012): [https://lublin.eu/en/lublin/news/lublin-ahead-of-wroclaw-gdansk-and-lodz,153,1261,1.html ''Lublin ahead of Wrocław, Gdańsk and Łódź''] (and behind Warsaw, Cracow, Katowice and Poznań).</ref>

Archaeological finds indicate a long presence of cultures in the area. A complex of settlements started to develop on the future site of Lublin and in its environs in the sixth to seventh centuries. Remains of settlements dating back to the sixth century were discovered in the centre of today's Lublin on Czwartek ("Thursday") Hill.

The [[early Middle Ages]] were marked by an intensified settlement of people, particularly in the areas along river valleys. The settlements were centred around the stronghold on Old Town Hill, which was likely one of the main centres of the [[Lendians]], a [[Lechites|Lechitic]] tribe. When the tribal [[stronghold]] was destroyed in the 10th century, the centre shifted to the northeast, to a new stronghold above Czechówka valley and, after the mid-12th century, to Castle Hill. At least two churches are presumed to have existed in Lublin in the early medieval period. One of them was most probably erected on Czwartek Hill during the rule of [[Casimir the Restorer]] in the 11th century.<ref name="Rozwalka">{{cite book |author=Andrzej Rozwałka |author2=Rafał Niedźwiadek |author3=Marek Stasiak |title='Origines Polonorum': Lublin wczesnośredniowieczny |work=The medieval urban complex of Lublin.

The location of Lublin at the eastern borders of the Polish lands gave it military significance. During the first half of the 13th century, Lublin was a target of attacks by [[Mongols]], [[Tatars]], [[Ruthenians]], and [[Lithuanians]], which resulted in its destruction.<ref name="Rozwalka"/> It was also ruled by [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]] between 1289 and 1302.<ref name="Rozwalka"/> Lublin was founded as a town by [[Władysław I the Elbow-high]] or between 1258 and 1279 during the rule of the prince [[Bolesław V the Chaste]].<ref name="Rozwalka"/> [[Casimir III the Great]], appreciating the site's strategic importance, built a masonry castle in 1341 and encircled the city with defensive walls.<ref name="lublin.eu">{{cite web|url=http://www.lublin.eu/images/media/1246528127_informator_angielski_POPRAWKI_06.2009.pdf|title=Tourist Guide: Lublin|work=Lublin City Council|date=2009|page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420082704/http://www.lublin.eu/images/media/1246528127_informator_angielski_POPRAWKI_06.2009.pdf|archive-date=20 April 2015}}</ref> From 1326, if not earlier, the stronghold on Castle Hill included a chapel in honor of the Holy Trinity.

In 1392, the city received an important trade privilege from the king [[Władysław II Jagiełło]]. With the coming of peace between Poland and Lithuania, it developed into a trade centre, handling a large portion of commerce between the countries. In 1474, the area around Lublin was carved out of [[Sandomierz Voivodeship]] and combined to form the [[Lublin Voivodeship]], the third voivodeship of Lesser Poland.

During the 15th and 16th centuries, the town grew rapidly. The largest trade fairs of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] were held in Lublin. In the 16th century, the parliaments (''[[Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland|Sejm]]'') of the Kingdom of Poland were held in Lublin several times. On 26 June 1569, one of the most important proclaimed the [[Union of Lublin]], which united Poland and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]]. Lublin as one of the most influential cities<ref name="Rozwalka"/> of the state enjoyed voting rights during the [[royal elections in Poland]].

Some of the artists and writers of the 16th century [[Polish renaissance]] lived and worked in Lublin, including [[Sebastian Klonowic]] and [[Jan Kochanowski]], who died in the city in 1584. In 1578, the [[Crown Tribunal]], the highest court of the [[Lesser Poland Province, Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Lesser Poland Province]], was established in Lublin.<ref name="Rozwalka"/>

Since the second half of the 16th century, [[Protestant Reformation]] movements devolved in Lublin, and a large congregation of [[Polish Brethren]] was present in the city. One of Poland's most important Jewish communities was established in Lublin around this time.<ref name="Rozwalka"/> Jews established a widely respected'' yeshiva'', Jewish hospital, synagogue, [[Old Jewish Cemetery, Lublin|cemetery]], and education centre (''kahal'') and built the Grodzka Gate (known as the Jewish Gate) in the historic district. Jews were a vital part of the city's life until the [[Holocaust]], during which they were relocated by [[Nazi Germany]] to the infamous [[Lublin Ghetto]] and ultimately murdered.<ref name="Rozwalka"/>

[[File:Lublin Union 1569.PNG|thumb|''[[Union of Lublin (painting)|Union of Lublin]]'', painting by [[Jan Matejko]] at the [[National Museum, Lublin|National Museum of Lublin]]]]

The yeshiva became a centre of learning of [[Talmud]] and [[Kabbalah]], leading the city to be called "the Jewish [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]".<ref name="Rozwalka"/> In 1567, the ''[[rosh yeshiva]]'' (headmaster) received the title of rector from the king along with rights and privileges equal to those of the heads of Polish universities.

The city declined due to the disastrous [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]], when it was invaded by [[Tsardom of Russia|Russo]]-[[Cossacks|Cossack]] forces in 1655, and [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] in 1656.

===19th and early 20th century===
After the [[Third Partition of Poland]] in 1795, Lublin was located in the [[Habsburg monarchy|Austrian empire]], then following the [[Austro-Polish War]] of 1809 it was part of the short-lived Polish [[Duchy of Warsaw]], and then in 1815 it became part of the [[Congress Poland]] in the [[Russian Partition]] of Poland.

At the beginning of the 19th century, new squares, streets, and public buildings were built. In 1877, a railway connection to Warsaw and [[Kovel]] and [[Lublin Station]] were constructed, spurring industrial development. Lublin's population grew from 28,900 in 1873 to 50,150 in 1897 (including 24,000 Jews).<ref>[[Joshua D. Zimmerman]], ''Poles, Jews and the Politics of Nationality'', Univ of Wisconsin Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-299-19464-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6sbr9cZyw_4C&dq=population+Brest+Poles+Jews&pg=PA16 Google Print, p. 16]</ref>

Russian rule ended in 1915, when the city was occupied by German and Austro-Hungarian armies. After the defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in 1918, [[Provisional People's Government of the Republic of Poland]] - the first government of independent Poland operated in Lublin for a short time. In the interwar years, the city continued to modernise and its population grew; important industrial enterprises were established, including the first aviation factory in Poland, the [[Plage i Laśkiewicz]] works, later nationalised as the [[LWS (aircraft manufacturer)|LWS]] factory. The [[Catholic University of Lublin]] was founded in 1918.

In 1921, Roman Catholics constituted 58.9% of the city's population, Jews - 39.5%. In 1931, 63.7% of the inhabitants were Roman Catholic and 34.7% Jewish.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sadkowski |first1=Konrad |title=Church, nation and state in Poland: Catholicism and national identity formation in the Lublin region, 1918–1939 |date=1995 |publisher=[[University of Michigan]] |pages=85–86}}</ref>

On July 20, 1931, {{ill|1931 Lublin tornado|lt=a violent tornado|simple}} carved a path of destruction through the city, destroying dozens of structures in downtown and killing six people. This tornado is officially rated F4 on the [[Fujita scale]]; however, the Polish Weather Service estimated winds at {{convert|246|to|324|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, potentially ranking it as an F5.<ref name="ESWD">{{cite web|publisher=European Severe Storms Laboratory|year=2022|access-date=December 8, 2022|title=European Severe Weather Database|url=http://essl.org/ESWD/}}</ref>

In early September 1939, during the joint German-Soviet [[invasion of Poland]], which started [[World War II]], the Polish government evacuated a portion of the Polish [[gold reserve]] from Warsaw to Lublin, and then further east to [[Łuck]],<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Wróbel|first=Janusz|year=2002|title=Wojenne losy polskiego złota|magazine=Biuletyn Instytutu Pamięci Narodowej|language=pl|publisher=[[Institute of National Remembrance|IPN]]|issue=8-9 (19-20)|page=56|issn=1641-9561}}</ref> before the city was [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupied by Germany]], and found itself in the newly formed [[General Government]] territory. The Polish population became a target of severe Nazi persecutions focusing on [[intelligentsia]] and Polish Jews. In November 1939, during the ''[[Intelligenzaktion]]'', the Germans carried out mass arrests of hundreds of Poles, including teachers, judges, lawyers, engineers, priests, lecturers of the local theological seminary, and lecturers and students of the [[Catholic University of Lublin]],<ref name=mw247>{{cite book|last=Wardzyńska|first=Maria|year=2009|title=Był rok 1939.

An attempt to "[[Germanisation in Poland (1939–1945)|Germanise]]" the city led to an influx of the ethnic ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'', increasing the number of German minority from 10–15% in 1939 to 20–25%.

The Jewish population was forced into the newly established [[Lublin Ghetto]] near [[Podzamcze, Lublin County|Podzamcze]]. The city served as headquarters for [[Operation Reinhardt]], the main German effort to exterminate all Jews in occupied Poland. The majority of the ghetto inmates, about 26,000 people, were deported to the [[Bełżec extermination camp]] between 17 March and 11 April 1942. The remainder were moved to facilities around the [[Majdanek concentration camp]] established at the outskirts of the city.

In the postwar years, Lublin continued to grow, tripling its population and greatly expanding its area. A considerable scientific and research base was established around the newly founded [[Maria Curie-Skłodowska University]]. A large automotive factory, [[Fabryka Samochodów Ciężarowych]] (FSO), was built in the city.

== Geography ==

[[File:Lublin wrotkow zalew zemborzycki 2009.jpg|thumb|Zemborzyce Lake]]

Lublin lies in eastern [[Poland]] on the [[Lublin Upland]]. The {{ill|Bystrzyca (Wieprz tributary)|lt=Bystrzyca|pl|Bystrzyca (dopływ Wieprza)}} river, a tributary of the [[Wieprz]] river, passes through the city and divides it into two parts: western, with a more varied relief with [[loess]] gorges, and eastern, which is flat. In the southern part of the city there is an artificial Zemborzyce Lake created by damming Bystrzyca.

The area of the city is 147 km2. The highest point lies at a height of {{Convert|235.0|m|ft|abbr=on}} and the lowest point at a height of {{Convert|163.6|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

Lublin has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb'') with cold, damp winters and warm summers.

The Lublin region is a part of eastern Poland, which has benefited less from the economic transformation after 1989 than regions of Poland located closer to [[Western Europe]]. Despite the fact that Lublin is one of the closest neighbour cities for Warsaw, the investment inflow in services from the Polish capital has secured a steady growth due to relatively fast connection, while external investments are progressing, enabling nearby satellite municipality [[Świdnik]] for large-scale industrial investments.{{Citation needed|date=February 2022}}

There is a visible growth in professionals eager to work in Lublin,{{Citation needed|date=February 2022}} due to reasons like quality of life, culture management, the environment, improving connection to Warsaw, levels of education, or financial, because of usually higher operating margins of global organisations present in the area.{{Citation needed|date=February 2022}}

==Culture and tourism==
Lublin is the largest city in eastern [[Poland]] and serves as an important regional cultural capital. Since then, many important international events have taken place here, involving international artists, researchers and politicians.

===Architecture===

Lublin's Old Town shares several traditions with Lesser Poland, mostly the dialect and historic architecture that brings a unique ambience comparable with [[Kraków]]. It is, however, a distinct experience, which benefits from artistic renovation, that progressed somehow slower and more modestly focusing more on quality and less on commercialization. Historic buildings, including ruined townhouses that await for new owners, create a unique atmosphere of the renaissance city. Lublin's Old Town has cobbled, narrow streets and mostly medieval layout and design. Many venues around Old Town enjoy an architecture applicable for restaurants, art hotels, pubs galleries, and clubs. Apart from entertainment, the area houses small businesses and prestigious offices.

There are several historic churches in the Old Town, including the [[Chapel of the Holy Trinity, Lublin Castle|Holy Trinity Chapel]] in [[Lublin Castle]] with the frescos, that are a mixture of Roman Catholic motifs with eastern Byzantine styles, reinforcing how the city connects the west with the east. Other important churches are the Late Gothic Virgin Mary Victorious Church, Renaissance Dominican Basilica and Bernardine church as well as [[Baroque in Poland|Baroque]] [[St. John the Baptist Cathedral, Lublin|St. John the Baptist Cathedral]].

Monuments of the 20th-century architecture include the [[Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva]] and its [[Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva Synagogue|synagogue]], socialist-realist [[:pl:Plac Zamkowy w Lublinie|Zamkowy Square]] and brutalist [[:pl:Osiedle Słowackiego (Lublin)|Słowacki housing estate]] by Oskar Hansen.
