==History==
===Pre-Columbian era===
The city of Santa Ana has a [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] origin. There is evidence of Preclassic settlements in the area of the city, mainly in the archaeological site of Villa Rosita, where the dominant centre was located in the area. This and other settlements were depopulated by the eruption of Lake Ilopango in 250 AD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ruta.org/admin/biblioteca/documentos/163.pdf |title=Perfil de Los Pueblos Indígenas en El Salvador | trans-title=Profile of Indigenous Peoples in El Salvador |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426054936/http://www.ruta.org/admin/biblioteca/documentos/163.pdf |publisher=Unidad Regional de Asistencia Técnica, [[Ministry of Education (El Salvador)|Ministry of Education]] |date=February 2003 |archive-date=26 April 2012 |url-status=dead |access-date=14 December 2015}}</ref>

The city was founded by the Maya Poqomam in the classical period. The first name of the settlement is unknown, however, it is known that when the [[Pipil people|Pipil]] entered and conquered the area in 1200 during the post-classic period, translated the original [[Nahuatl]] name, which was Sihuatehuacán, which means place of priestesses. Sihuatehuacán was located in what is now the suburb of Santa Barbara, west of the Apanchacal and Apanteos rivers.<ref name="guanaquin.com">guanaquin.com</ref>

===Conquest and colonization===
The town was conquered by the Spanish between 1530 and 1540. On July 26, 1569, [[Guatemala]]n bishop [[Bernardino Villalpando]] changed the name from Sihuatehuacán to that of Santa Ana. The new town at the time was part of the Greater Mayorship of San Salvador. 

San Salvador, the city of Santa Ana, and the western and central part of the current Salvadoran territory (except St Vincent and the paracentral area) was administered by the mayor of the department of San Salvador.<ref name="FISL-Conoce a tu municipio" /><ref name="Templo_historia El Salvador">Templo cristiano [https://web.archive.org/web/20080609100708/http://www.templocristiano.org/ES/historia.htm Historia de El Salvador], consultado el 28 de enero de 2009.</ref> Since 1770, the central parish of the city (located where the cathedral was built later) was the head of the parish of Santa Ana. From 1786-1824, the Santa Ana district was part of the San Salvador municipality (''[[Intendencia de San Salvador]]'').<ref name="guanaquin.com"/><ref name="FISL-Conoce a tu municipio">FISL-Conoce a tu municipio</ref><ref name="CCD Santa Ana Historia">{{cite web

===19th century===
In 1806, the council of the town of Santa Ana was established. Its first mayor was José Mariano Castro.<ref name="FISL-Conoce a tu municipio" /> Five years later, there were two uprisings in the town as part of the uprising in San Salvador, the first on 17 November 1811, another on 24 June 1812. In November 1812, it was designated with the title of town.<ref name="independencia">{{cite book
| last = Revista Independentista
| title = Movimientos de Libertad
| publisher = El Salvador: La Prensa Gráfica
}}</ref>

On 21 December 1821, the council declared independence from  Spain. In 1824, it received the title of city, as part of the department of Sonsonate. In 1835, it became the head of that department. In 1854, the town of Santa Lucia Chacalcingo became part of Santa Ana. A year later, the Department of Santa Ana was created.<ref name="CCD Santa Ana Historia" />

In 1894, a revolution that would overthrew President [[Carlos Ezeta]], who had ruled the country as de facto dictator (from the current headquarters of the Second Infantry Brigade of Santa Ana) occurred. Since then, the town earned the nickname of "the heroic city" as the 44 rebels who led the revolution were from the municipality. They stormed the government headquarters to end the dictatorship.

===Postwar 20th century and Civil Santa Ana in 1916===
[[File:ES Palacio Municipal Santa Ana 05 2012 1597.JPG|thumb|Municipal Palace of Santa Ana]] 
In the so-called "golden age of coffee" in El Salvador, Santa Ana was the most prosperous city in the country, because many of the businessmen who lived in that town owned important coffee processing plants that prepared the coffee for sale. La Hacienda El Molino, owned by the Colombian Rafael Alvarez, was the main plantation and coffee processing plant because of its fame and its technological modernism at the time.<ref>EDH [http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/EDICIONESANTERIORES/julio15/NACIONAL/nacio17.html Rafael Álvarez: pionero de la industrialización del café] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303211929/http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/EDICIONESANTERIORES/julio15/NACIONAL/nacio17.html |date=2009-03-03 }}, consultado el 17 de enero del 2009</ref>

During the civil war in El Salvador (1980–1992), the municipality of Santa Ana was also affected by armed conflict, which led to the emigration of many residents of the city.
After the war, Santa Ana and all of El Salvador began to address the problem of rising crime rates,<ref>LPG [http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2006/09/21/nacional/nac18.asp Triángulo del crimen] consultado el 31 July 2008.</ref> mostly due to the existence of "maras" or gangs, mainly generated by the deportation of illegal immigrants from the United States. This scourge has been fought with government programs and ordinances issued by the council municipal.<ref>Antonio Martínez Uribe, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080621052341/http://www.libros.com.sv/edicion0A/paz.html Los acuerdos de paz en El Salvador: 15 años después] consultado el 13 July 2008.</ref><ref>Alcaldía de Santa Ana: [https://web.archive.org/web/20071030130923/http://www.santaana.gob.sv/contenido.php?name=Gobierno&categoria=1 Ordenanzas municipales] consultado el 13 July 2008</ref>

Since the civil war, the municipality has received allowances sent by Salvadorians living abroad to their friends and family. This money has become the largest source of revenue for Santa Ana and El Salvador.<ref>Elizabeth Campbell, [http://lnweb90.worldbank.org/oed/oeddoclib.nsf/b57456d58aba40e585256ad400736404/7307793bb6c30e1c8525683c005c6dc8/$FILE/172preSp.pdf La reconstrucción en los países en etapa de posguerra:El Salvador] consultado el 21 July 2008.</ref>

The PLAMADUR spurred the growth, expansion and management of ciudad.<ref>El Diario de Hoy, [http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/EDICIONESANTERIORES/julio24/DEPARTAMENTALES/depar1.html Santa Ana será una gran ciudad dentro de 20 años] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616024058/http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/EDICIONESANTERIORES/julio24/DEPARTAMENTALES/depar1.html |date=2008-06-16 }} consultado el 13 July 2008</ref>

Also in 2004, the Salvadorian government introduced the National Land Management Plan and Territorial Development (PNODT) that promotes the development, integration and competitiveness of Salvadoran municipalities. For the purposes of planning and development of municipalities, these have been grouped into regions, subregions and microregions.<ref>Ministerio de Obras Públicas [http://www2.mop.gob.sv/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=642 Presentación del PNODT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213195156/http://www.mop.gob.sv/modules.php?name=News |date=2007-02-13 }}, consultado el 27 December 2008</ref> The municipality of Santa Ana was incorporated into the region, "West Central subregion, Santa Ana - Resume" and "microregion of Santa Ana".{{cn|date=November 2021}}
