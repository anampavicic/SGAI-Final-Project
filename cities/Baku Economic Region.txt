Traces of human settlement in the region of present-day Baku date back to the [[Stone Age]]. [[Bronze-Age]] rock carvings have been discovered near Bayil, and a bronze figure of a small fish in the territory of the Old City. These have led some to suggest the existence of a Bronze-Age settlement within the city's territory.<ref>[http://azerisite.narod.ru/2.html Город Баку...] {{Webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140319033931/http://azerisite.narod.ru/2.html |date= 19 March 2014 }} Retrieved on 24 June 2006</ref> Near [[Nardaran]], a place called Umid Gaya features a prehistoric observatory, where images of the sun and of various constellations are carved into rock together with a primitive astronomic table.<ref>Ancient Observatory of Absheron.

In the 1st century AD, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] organised two Caucasian campaigns and reached what is today Baku. Near the city, in what is today [[Gobustan National Park|Gobustan]], Roman inscriptions dating from AD 84 to 96 survive – some of the earliest written evidences for a city there.<ref>{{Cite web |title= Azerbaijan – Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace... |url=http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-AzerbaijanBaku.htm |archive-url= https://archive.today/20080102011734/http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-AzerbaijanBaku.htm |archive-date= 2 January 2008 |access-date= 14 October 2007}}</ref>
