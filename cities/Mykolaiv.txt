'''Mykolaiv''' ({{langx|uk|Миколаїв}}, {{IPA|uk|mɪkoˈlɑjiu̯|IPA|uk-Миколаїв.ogg}}; {{langx|ru|Николаев|Nikolayev}} {{IPA-ru|nʲɪkɐˈɫa(j)ɪf|}}) is a [[List of cities in Ukraine|city]] and a [[hromada]] (municipality) in southern [[Ukraine]]. Mykolaiv is the [[Administrative centre|administrative center]] of [[Mykolaiv Raion]] ([[Raions of Ukraine|district]]) and [[Mykolaiv Oblast]] ([[Oblasts of Ukraine|province]]). The city of Mykolaiv, which provides Ukraine with access to the [[Black Sea]], is the location of the most downriver bridge crossing of the [[Southern Bug]] river. This city is one of the main [[shipbuilding]] centers of the Black Sea. Aside from three shipyards within the city, there are a number of research centers specializing in shipbuilding such as the [[State Research and Design Shipbuilding Center]], [[Zoria-Mashproekt]] and others. As of 2022, the city has a population of {{Ua-pop-est2022|470011|punct=.}} Mykolaiv holds the honorary title [[Hero City of Ukraine]].

The city serves as a transportation hub for Ukraine, containing a sea [[port]], commercial port, river port, [[highway]], [[Junction (rail)|railway junction]], and [[airport]].

Much of Mykolaiv's land area consists of parks. Park Peremohy (''Victory'') is a large park on the peninsula just north of the city center, on the north side of the [[Inhul]] river.

== Name ==
The city is known under two names, which differ in Ukrainian and Russian; there are several [[transliteration]]s of each name. The Ukrainian name of the city is Миколаїв, transliterated as '''''Mykolaiv'''''. The Russian name, Никола́ев, transliterates as '''''Nikolaev''''' or as ''Nikolayev''.
The city's founding was made by the Russian conquests during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792)|Second Russo-Turkish War]] of 1787–1792. Founded by Prince [[Grigory Potemkin]] as Nikolaev, it was the last of the many cities he established. On 27 August 1789,<ref>Kruchkov Yuriy Ivanovich "Старый Николаев и окрестности. Топонимический словарь-справочник." ["Old Nikolaev and neighborhoods. Toponymic dictionary-reference."] (in Russian). Page 37: " Еще ранее здесь находилась земляная крепость (редут) Новогригорьевская (см.).
Судостроительная верфь называлась «Новая верфь», «Ингульская верфь», «Уст ьИнгульск», «Верфь на Ингуле»; занималась вначале только ремонтом судов. Ордером №1065 от 27 августа 1789 г. Потемкин повелел «нововозводимую верфь на Ингулеименовать городом Николаев»."</ref> Potemkin ordered its naming near the wharf at the mouth of the [[Inhul|Ingul]] river, on a high, cool and breezy spot where the Ingul river meets the [[Southern Bug]] river. To build the city he brought in peasants, soldiers, and Turkish prisoners; 2,500 were working there during 1789. The shipyards were built first (1788).<ref>

Potemkin named the city after [[Saint Nicholas]], the patron of seafarers, on whose day (6 December) he had obtained victory at the [[Siege of Ochakov (1788)|siege of Ochakov]]<ref>Montefiore, Simon. "Potemkin: Catherine The Great’s Imperial Partner," Vintage Books, 2000, p.277</ref> in 1788. The name ''Nikolaev'' is known from the legal order (writ) Number 1065 by Prince Potemkin to {{ill|Mikhail Faleev|ru|Фалеев, Михаил Леонтьевич}} dated 27 August 1789.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/phoenixlibr/dokumenty/ordera-potemkina-faleevu |title=Ордера князя Потемкина-Таврического 1788 - 1791 гг.

In 1920, after the establishment of [[Soviet power]], the [[Odessa Governorate|Odesa provincial council]] (of laborers and peasants' deputies) petitioned the Soviet Ukrainian government—the [[All-Ukrainian Central Executive Committee]] (VUTSIK)—to rename the city of Mykolaiv to Vernoleninsk ("Faithful to Lenin"). As the city of Mykolaiv was a district center of the Odesan province, presumably, the petition would have been initiated by the Odesa city council, but documentary evidence of this so far has not been identified. On 15 April 1924 the Plenum of the Central Administrative-Territorial Commission of the VUTSIK considered and rejected the petition of the Odesan executive committee. Perhaps the members of the Soviet-Ukraine government thought that the name sounded too obsequious.<ref name="history.mk.ua">{{cite web |url=http://history.mk.ua/vernoleninsk-wernoleninsk-vernoleninsk.htm |title=Верноленинск /Wernoleninsk, Wiernoleninsk,Vernoleninsk/ |date=12 August 2013 |access-date=30 August 2014 |archive-date=3 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903080707/http://history.mk.ua/vernoleninsk-wernoleninsk-vernoleninsk.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Information regarding the alleged renaming of Mykolaiv was disseminated by German maps of the 1920s and 1930s, as well as in German encyclopedic publications in 1927 and 1932, which show Vernoleninsk on the USSR part of the European maps. The city was designated as Mykolaiv in publications of the same map in other languages.<ref name="history.mk.ua" />

To distinguish Mykolaiv from the much smaller west Ukraine city of [[Mykolaiv, Lviv Oblast|Mykolaiv]] in [[Lviv Oblast]], the latter is sometimes called "Mykolaiv on the Dniester" after the [[Dniester|major river]] that it is situated on, while the former is located on the [[Southern Bug]], another major river, and may also be called "Mykolaiv on the Bug".

Archaeologists have found proof of ancient settlements on the territory of Mykolaiv.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4UcOAQAAMAAJ&q=Mykolaiv+early+settlements |title=Encyclopedia of Ukraine |first=Danylo Husar |last=Struk |date=18 November 1993 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=9780802033628 |access-date=18 November 2017 |via=Google Books |archive-date=18 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221018113403/https://books.google.com/books?id=4UcOAQAAMAAJ&q=Mykolaiv+early+settlements |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2018, archaeologists discovered a sunken Ancient Greek ship near the Mykolaiv region, dating from the fifth century BC, the period of [[Greek colonization#Greek colonies|Greek colonization]] of the Northern Black Sea.

The city has long had close associations with [[shipbuilding]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympic_games/world_olympic_dreams/8931237.stm |title=BBC Sport – Olga Kharlan's school – School No 4, Mykolaiv, Ukraine |work=BBC News |date=10 September 2010 |access-date=26 March 2013}}</ref>

The area was populated throughout time by [[Scythians]], [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], [[List of ancient Slavic peoples|Slavic tribes]], hordes of nomads and free [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]]. However, the intensive settlement of the Mykolaiv peninsula started in the last quarter of the 18th century already after the liberation of the northern Black Sea coast region from the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The Russian Empire's [[Black Sea Fleet|Black Sea Navy]] Headquarters was in Mykolaiv for more than 100 years until the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] moved it to [[Sevastopol]], near the southern tip of the [[Crimean Peninsula]]. During the [[Crimean War]] (1853-1856), Mykolaiv became the main rear base to support Russia's efforts in the war. Most [[company|business]]es that were created in the city belonged to the military-industrial complex, and, consequently, Mykolaiv was closed to foreigners for many decades.<ref name="history">[http://www.gorsovet.mk.ua/center/history.en History of the city] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522050304/http://gorsovet.mk.ua/center/history.en |date=22 May 2012 }}, gorsovet.mk.ua {{dead link|date=June 2022}}</ref>
[[File:Shipyard, Nikolaev, c. 1900.jpg|thumb|Shipyard in Mykolaiv circa 1900]]
By the late 19th century, Mykolaiv's port ranked third in the Russian Empire (after [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Odesa]]) in trade with foreign countries. Grain-export suppliers of the steppe region (of Ukraine and Southern Russia) were the greatest in the Russian Empire. Mykolaiv had become a great industrial center in the Southern Ukraine.<ref name="history" />

Jews started to settle in Mykolaiv in the late 18th century.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nikolayev |url=https://collections.yadvashem.org/en/untold-stories/community/14621811-Nikolayev |access-date=2023-03-13 |website=@yadvashem |language=en}}</ref> By being in the area west of the Dnieper which was where Jews were legally allowed to reside (the [[Pale of Settlement]]), Mykolaiv became a major Jewish centre of the Russian Empire in the 19th century. During the course of the 19th century, the Czarist governments largely banned Jews from living east of the [[Dnieper River]]. In 1866 restrictions were lifted and the Jewish community of Mykolaiv developed rapidly but years later Jews suffered in the [[Pogrom|pogroms]] of May 1881 and April 1899. The Lubavitcher Rebbe, [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] (the seventh leader in the Chabad-Lubavitch dynasty) was born in Mykolaiv on 18 April 1902. 

The town was occupied in 1918 by [[Imperial German Army |German troops]] who were commanded by Field Marshal [[Hermann von Eichhorn]].<ref>

In 1920, [[Politics of the Soviet Union|Soviet power]] was established.<ref name="history" /> In 1926 there were 21,786 Jews (about 20.8% of the total population) in Mykolaiv.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mykolaiv, Ukraine |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/nikolayev |access-date=2023-03-13 |website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}</ref>

In the course of [[Operation Barbarossa]] Mykolaiv was occupied on 16 August 1941 by German invaders. In September, German forces [[Nikolaev Massacre|massacred over 35,000]] non-combatants, many of them Jews, in the city and its region. During the occupation, an underground partisan sabotage group, the Mykolaiv Center, conducted [[guerilla]] activities. On 28 March 1944 the city was liberated, in part because of Soviet Senior Lieutenant [[Konstantin Olshansky|Konstantin F. Olshansky]]'s marines and their daring raid during which the majority of his troops were killed.

In the post-war period Mykolaiv became one of the shipbuilding centers of the USSR, with three shipyards: [[Black Sea Shipyard|Black Sea]], [[Shipyard named after 61 Communards|61 Kommunara]], and [[Okean Shipyard|Okean]].

The asteroid [[8141 Nikolaev]] (1982 SO4) was discovered in 1982 by [[Nikolai Chernykh]] at the [[Crimean Astrophysical Observatory]] and was named in honor of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=8141 |title=8141 Nikolaev (1982 SO4) |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |access-date=24 March 2017 |archive-date=18 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221018113408/https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_lookup.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

During the [[Euromaidan]] protests of 2013–2014, Mykolayiv was the scene of anti-[[Viktor Yanukovych|Yanukovich]] protests. After the victory of Euromaidan, the situation calmed down somewhat until 7 April 2014, when some [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|pro-Russians]] tried to take over the local administration building. Pro-Ukrainians stopped them from taking over the administration building and destroyed the pro-Russian camp not far from it, after which the situation in the city became calm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://euromaidanpress.com/2015/08/13/meet-the-people-behind-novorossiyas-grassroots-defeat/ |title=Meet the people behind Novorossiya's grassroots defeat |publisher=[[Euromaidan Press]] |date=13 August 2015 |access-date=23 March 2020 |archive-date=23 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200323151601/http://euromaidanpress.com/2015/08/13/meet-the-people-behind-novorossiyas-grassroots-defeat/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Until 18 July 2020, Mykolaiv was incorporated as a [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]]. It also served as the administrative center of Mykolaiv and [[Vitovka Raion]]s even though it did not belong to any of these raions.

== Administrative status ==

Mykolaiv is the [[Capital city|administrative center]] of [[Mykolaiv Oblast]] ([[Oblast|region]]), as well as that of [[Mykolaiv Raion]]. It hosts the administration of [[Mykolaiv urban hromada, Mykolaiv Oblast|Mykolaiv urban hromada]], one of the [[hromada]]s of Ukraine.<ref name="admreform_2020_mykolaiv_mykolaiv">{{cite web |title=Николаевская городская громада |url=https://gromada.info/ru/obschina/mykolaiv/ |publisher=Портал об'єднаних громад України |language=ru |access-date=7 October 2022 |archive-date=7 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221007102923/https://gromada.info/ru/obschina/mykolaiv/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:Вид сверху на Николаев.jpg|thumb|Bird's-eye view of the city center at the [[Knee (geography)|river knee]] of [[Southern Bug]] (Boh)]]

Mykolaiv is located in a primarily flat terrain area, the fertile, grain-producing steppe region of [[southern Ukraine]]. The nearest mountains to Mykolaiv are {{cvt|300|km|0|abbr=off}} south, at the southern end of the [[Crimea|Crimean Peninsula]]. The lack of any mountain barriers north of Mykolaiv means that cold Arctic winds can blow south, unimpeded by any terrain elevation, to Mykolaiv in winter.

Mykolaiv is on a peninsula along the [[estuary]] of the [[Southern Bug]] river where it meets the [[Inhul]] River, {{cvt|65|km|mi|sp=us}} from the [[Black Sea]].<ref name="beautification">[http://www.gorsovet.mk.ua/beautification/general.ru Благоустройство города] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504095537/http://gorsovet.mk.ua/beautification/general.ru |date=4 May 2012 }}, gorsovet.mk.ua</ref> Both the Inhul River and the Southern Bug River follow very winding courses just before they join at the northeast corner of Mykolaiv. This has created several long and narrow peninsulas just north of Mykolaiv, and the main part of Mykolaiv is itself on a peninsula at a 180-degree bend in the Southern Bug River.

The area of the city is {{cvt|260|km2|0|abbr=out}}.<ref name="passport">{{cite web |url=http://www.gorsovet.mk.ua/foreing_affairs/passport01.en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424185812/http://gorsovet.mk.ua/foreing_affairs/passport01.en |url-status=dead |title=''Mykolayiv City Council: Nikolaev.
