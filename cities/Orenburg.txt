'''Orenburg''' ({{langx|ru|Оренбу́рг}}, {{IPA|ru|ɐrʲɪnˈburk|pron}}; {{langx|kk|Орынбор}}), formerly known as '''Chkalov''' (1938–1957), is the [[administrative center]] of [[Orenburg Oblast]], [[Russia]] and former capital of the [[Kazak ASSR]]. It lies on [[Eastern Europe]], on the banks of the [[Ural River]], where it forms the [[Boundaries between the continents|boundary between Europe and Asia]], and is {{convert|1478|km|sp=us}} southeast of [[Moscow]].

Orenburg is close to the [[Kazakhstan-Russia border|border]] with [[Kazakhstan]].

==Etymology==

Several historians have tried to explain the origins of the city's name. It was traditionally accepted that the word "orenburg" means a fortress on the [[Or River|River Or]].<ref>Поспелов Е.М. Географические названия мира: топонимический словарь. — М.: Русские словари; Астрель; ACT, 2002. — {{ISBN|5-17-002938-1}}; 5-271-00446-5; 5-93259-014-9; 5-17-001389-2.</ref> In all probability, the word combination "orenburg" was proposed by {{Interlanguage link|I. K. Kirillov|ru|Кирилов, Иван Кириллович}}, the founder of the city. In 1734, in accordance with his project, a package of governmental documents was worked out. This was the starting point for Orenburg as a fortress city near the meeting of the [[Or (river)|Or]] and Ural rivers.

On 7 June 1734, "A Privilege for Orenburg" (tsar's edict) was ordered by [[Anna of Russia|Empress Anna Ioannovna]].

While the construction site of the main fortress changed many times (down the River Ural), the name "Orenburg" has not changed since its founding in 1743. Between 1938 and 1957, the city was referred to as Chkalov,<ref>Оренбург — статья из Большой советской энциклопедии.</ref><ref>Город был переименован Указом ПрезидиумаПрезидиума Верховного Совета СССР от 26 декабря 1938 г.</ref> named after the famous Soviet pilot [[Valery Chkalov]], although he was not born in and never lived in Orenburg, and never visited Orenburg. In 1954, Chkalov's five-meter bronze sculpture was erected on the occasion of his 50th birth anniversary; this was installed on a seven-meter pedestal on the Boulevard (the riverside promenade of the city, commonly named "Belovka").

==History==
In 1734, the [[Russian Empire]] began to expand its dominance and influence in Asia by building a fortified city called Orenburg on its eastern border (Southern Urals). For this purpose, in 1735, Ivan Kirilov, a cartographer and statistician, began to develop the settlement at the confluence of the rivers [[Or (river)|Or]] and [[Ural (river)|Ural]], and the first settlement was chosen during his expedition. He claimed that the town was needed "to open a transit route to Bukhara, Badakhshan, Balkh and India" and that "riches in the form of gold, lapis lazuli and garnets could be obtained from it". After his death, a new manager of the Orenburg expedition, [[Vasily Tatishchev]], was appointed who did not consider the place suitable for building a city. Therefore, in 1739 he began preparations for the construction of a new town with the old name on Krasnaya Gora (Red Mountain), downstream of the Ural (Yaik)River. The old settlement was named the Orsk fortress (now the city of [[Orsk]]).<ref>С.М.Стрельников. Географические названия Оренбургской области. — Изд. 2-е, доп. и испр. — Кувандык, 2002. — 176 с.</ref>

On August 6, 1741, the new town was laid out. However, its construction never started. The place on Krasnaya Gora was not suitable for the construction of the city, as it was treeless, rocky and far from the river. A new manager of the Orenburg expedition [[Ivan Neplyuev]] was appointed, and on April 19, 1743, Orenburg was built up on the third attempt, at the place where the Berd settlement was earlier located, 75&nbsp;km (46miles) from the Krasnaya Gora. In the summer of 1742, Neplyuev was assigned to build the city on the site of the rivers [[Yaik]] and [[Sakmara (river)|Sakmara]]. The new place, surrounded by forests and fields where the Yaik and Sakumara rivers converge, was chosen by Neplyuev himself. Today it is the historical center of the city. The town built on the Red Mountain was named Krasnogorsk. Thus, in 1743 Ivan Neplyuev founded Orenburg on thesite of present-day Orsk, about 250 kilometers west of the Urals. This third Orenburg served as an important military outpost on the border with the nomadic [[Kazakhs]]. It became the center of the Orenburg Cossacks. In the first half of the 18th century, the [[Russian Empire]] constructed the  {{Interlanguage link|Irtysh line|ru|Иртышская линия}}, a series of forty-six forts, including Orenburg,<ref>"''Russian Colonization and the Genesis of Kazak National Consciousness''". S. Sabol (2003).

Edward A. Allworth, Edward Allworth (1994). Duke University Press. p. 10. {{ISBN|0822315211}}</ref> 

Orenburg played a major role in [[Pugachev's Rebellion]] (1773–1774), the largest peasant revolt in Russian history. At the time, it was the capital of a vast district and the seat of the governor. Yemelyan Pugachev besieged the city and its fortress from nearby [[Berdy (Orenburg)|Berda]] from October 1773 to March 26, 1774. The defense was organized by Governor of Orenburg lieutenant-general  [[:ru:Рейнсдорп, Иван Андреевич|Reinsdorf]].<ref>Shane O'Rourke [https://books.google.com/books?id=GuhoAAAAMAAJ The Cossacks] Manchester University Press, 2008 {{ISBN|9780719076800}}</ref>
General [[:ru:Голицын, Пётр Михайлович|Golytsin]] defeated Pugachev at Berda, and later again at [[:ru:Каргала (Оренбургская область)|Kargala]] (north of Orenburg).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=tW_eEVbVxpEC&pg=PA1001 Tatishchevo 1774] in Tony Jaques ''Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: P-Z'' {{ISBN|9780313335396}}</ref> Most of the city was left in ruins, and thousands of inhabitants had died in the siege. Government forces crushed revolt towards the end of 1774 by General [[Johann von Michelsohnen|Michelsohn]] at [[Tsaritsyn]]. Further reprisals against rebel areas were carried out by General [[Petr Ivanovich Panin|Peter Panin]].

[[Alexander Pushkin]] visited Orenburg in 1833 during a research trip for his books ''[[The History of Pugachev]]'' and his famous novel ''[[The Captain's Daughter]]''. He met his friend [[Vladimir Dal]] here, who would later write the first serious dictionary of the Russian language.

Orenburg was the base for General [[Vasily Alekseevich Perovsky|Perovsky]]'s expeditions against the [[Khanate of Khiva]] in the 1830s through 1850s.  After the incorporation of [[Central Asia]] into the [[Russian Empire]], Orenburg became a trading station and, since the completion of the [[Trans-Aral Railway]], a prominent [[junction (rail)|railway junction]] en route to the [[Russian Turkestan|new Central Asian possessions]] and to [[Siberia]].

Orenburg functioned as the capital of the [[Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic (1920–1925)|Kirghiz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] (in present-day [[Kazakhstan]]) within Russia from 1920 to 1925. When that republic was renamed [[Kazakh Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic]] in 1925, Orenburg joined Russia and [[Kyzylorda]] became the new capital. [[Almaty]] became the capital in 1929 after the construction of the [[Turkestan–Siberia Railway]]. Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was promoted to union republic status as the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic [[Kazakh SSR]] in 1936. Orenburg remained in Russia. From 1938 to 1957, the city bore the name '''Chkalov''' ({{lang|ru|Чка́лов}}) (after the prominent test pilot [[Valery Chkalov]]). The city's distance from the German invasion during [[World War II]] led many Soviet enterprises to flee there, helping to spur the city's economic growth.
