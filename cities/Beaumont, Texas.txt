'''Beaumont''' is a city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]]. It is the [[county seat|seat of government]] of [[Jefferson County, Texas|Jefferson County]],<ref name="GR6">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |access-date=June 7, 2011 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302041221/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archive-date=March 2, 2011  }}</ref> within the Beaumont–[[Port Arthur, Texas|Port Arthur]] [[Beaumont–Port Arthur metropolitan area|metropolitan statistical area]], located in [[Southeast Texas]] on the [[Neches River]] about {{convert|85|mi}} east of [[Houston]] (city center to city center). With a population of 115,282 at the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]],<ref name="Census2020">{{Cite web|title=Geography Profile: Beaumont city, Texas|url=https://data.census.gov/cedsci/profile?g=1600000US4807000|access-date=2022-02-18|website=data.census.gov}}</ref> Beaumont is the largest municipality by population near the [[Louisiana]] border. Its metropolitan area was the [[List of Texas metropolitan areas|10th largest in Texas]] in 2020, and [[List of metropolitan statistical areas|130th in the United States]].

The city of Beaumont was founded in 1838.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Beaumont, Texas|url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/beaumont-tx|access-date=2022-02-18|website=www.tshaonline.org}}</ref> The pioneer settlement had an economy based on the development of lumber, farming, and port industries. In 1892, [[Joseph Eloi Broussard]] opened the first commercially successful rice mill in Texas, stimulating development of rice farming in the area; he also started an irrigation company (since 1933, established as the [[Lower Neches Valley Authority]]) to support rice culture. Rice became an important commodity crop in Texas and is now cultivated in 23 counties.<ref name="Handbook">{{cite web  | title = Broussard, Joseph Eloi  | work = The Handbook of Texas Online  | url = https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbrbh | access-date = March 14, 2015 }}</ref>

A big change occurred in 1901 with the [[Spindletop]] gusher, which demonstrated that a huge oil field lay underneath and adjacent to the city. With Spindletop, several energy companies developed in Beaumont, and some remain. The area rapidly developed as one of the country's major petrochemical refining areas. Along with [[Port Arthur, Texas|Port Arthur]] and [[Orange, Texas|Orange]], Beaumont forms the [[Golden Triangle (Texas)|Golden Triangle]], a major industrial area on the Texas [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]].

Beaumont is home to [[Lamar University]], a national [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|Carnegie]] doctoral research university with over 14,000 students, including undergraduates and postgraduates. Over the years, several corporations have been based in this city, including Gulf States Utilities, which had its headquarters in Beaumont until its takeover by [[Entergy Corporation]] in 1994. GSU's [[Edison Plaza]] headquarters remains the tallest building in Beaumont.

In 1824 Noah and Nancy Tevis settled on the west bank of the [[Neches River]] and developed a farm. Soon after that, a small community grew up around the farm, which was named ''Tevis Bluff'' or ''Neches River Settlement''.<ref name=Beaumont_TX>{{cite web | author = Paul E.

Beaumont became a town on December 16, 1838. Beaumont's first mayor was [[Alexander Calder (Beaumont, Texas)|Alexander Calder]].<ref name="Rienstra2">{{cite book | last = Rienstra | first = Ellen Walker | author2 = Linsley, Judith Walker | title = Historic Beaumont: An Illustrated History | publisher = Historical Publishing Network | year = 2003 | page = 21 | isbn =  1-893619-28-1}}</ref> From the town's founding in 1835, business activities included real estate, transportation, and retail sales. Later, other businesses were formed, especially in railroad construction and operation, new building construction, lumber sales, and communications. The Port of Beaumont became a successful regional shipping center. Beaumont was a small center for cattle raisers and farmers in its early years. With an active riverport by the 1880s, it became an important lumber and rice-milling town. The city exported rice as a commodity crop. Beaumont's lumber boom, which reached its peak in the late 19th century, was stimulated by the rebuilding and expansion of the railroads in the state and region after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web |author1=Robert S.

The Beaumont Rice Mill, founded in 1892 by [[Joseph Eloi Broussard]], was the first commercially successful rice mill in Texas.<ref name="Handbook" /> In addition, Broussard cofounded the Beaumont Irrigation Company in 1898 to operate an irrigation system to support rice culture. The company along with four others established around the same time helped stimulate the expansion of rice cultivation from 1500 acres in 1892 to 400,000 acres in 23 counties by his death in 1956.<ref name="Handbook" /> The other companies were The Port Arthur Rice and Irrigation Company, The McFaddin-Wiess-Kyle Canal Company, the Treadaway or Neches Canal Company, and  the Taylors-Hillebrand complex.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jefferson County, Texas Its Geological, Historical and Agricultural Background Part D: Jefferson County Agriculture After 1900t |url=http://www.wtblock.com/wtblockjr/jefferso.htm |publisher=W..

[[Petroleum|Oil]] was discovered at nearby [[Spindletop]] on January 10, 1901. Spindletop became the first major [[oil field]] and one of the largest in American history. With the discovery of oil at Spindletop, Beaumont's population more than tripled in two months from 9,000 in January 1901 to 30,000 in March 1901.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}

[[Captain W. C. Tyrrell|William Casper Tyrrell]], nicknamed "Captain W.C.", was a leading businessman and oil tycoon in the city in the early 20th century, developing businesses during the [[Texas Oil Boom]]. An entrepreneur from Pennsylvania and Iowa, he arrived after the gusher at [[Spindletop]], and invested in development of a commercial port in the city, and an irrigation system to support the local rice industry, as well as residential and retail development of suburban property. He was also a philanthropist. He purchased and donated First Baptist Church, whose congregation had moved to a new facility, to use as the city's first public library, now known as the [[Tyrrell Historical Library]].<ref>Carolyn Davis Smith, "Captain William Casper Tyrrell: Philanthropist Extraordinaire and the Legacy of Philanthropy in Beaumont," ''Texas Gulf Historical and Biographical Record'' 2002 38: 5–18</ref>

When the city became a major center for defense shipbuilding during [[World War II]], tens of thousands of rural Texans migrated there for the new high-paying jobs. The Roosevelt administration ordered the defense industry to be integrated, and many Southern white males were working closely with black males for the first time. Housing was scarce in the crowded city, and racial tensions increased. In June 1943 after workers at the [[Pennsylvania Shipyards|Pennsylvania shipyards]] in Beaumont learned that a white woman had accused a black man of raping her, nearly 2,000 went to the jail where a suspect was being held, attracting more men along the way and reaching a total of 4,000.<ref>{{cite web | author = James S.

No one was prosecuted for the deaths. The riot in [[Beaumont Race Riot of 1943|Beaumont]] was one of several in 1943 which centered in the defense industry, including [[Zoot Suit Riots|Los Angeles]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Los Angeles Zoot Suit Riots|url=http://www.laalmanac.com/history/hi07t.htm|publisher=Los Angeles Almanac|access-date=January 2, 2015}}</ref> [[Detroit Race Riot (1943)|Detroit]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Hatred on the Home Front: The Race Riots During WWII|url=http://life.time.com/history/detroit-race-riots-1943-photos-from-a-city-in-turmoil-during-wwii/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607202717/http://life.time.com/history/detroit-race-riots-1943-photos-from-a-city-in-turmoil-during-wwii/|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 7, 2013|publisher=Time Inc.|access-date=January 2, 2015}}</ref> and [[Mobile, Alabama]] as well as other cities across the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Detroit Race Riots 1943|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/eleanor-riots/|publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation|access-date=September 22, 2015|quote=In many cities the demands of wartime were manifesting themselves in outbursts of intolerance.

During the war years, airmen cadets from the Royal Air Force, flying from their training base at Terrell, Texas, routinely flew to Beaumont on training flights. The community served as a stand-in for the British for Paris, France, which was the same distance from London, England as Beaumont is from Terrell.<ref>[[AT6 Monument]]</ref>

In the postwar years, Beaumont's port continued in importance. As was typical with other cities, post-war highway construction led to the development of new suburbs and dispersal of the population in search of new housing. Recently, there has been some renewal in Downtown Beaumont and in other areas of the city.

In 1996, the Jefferson County courts, located in Beaumont, became the first court in the nation to implement electronic filing and service of court documents. This eliminated the need for law firms to print and mail reams of documents.

In 2005 and 2008, Beaumont and surrounding areas suffered extensive damage from [[Hurricane Rita]] and [[Hurricane Ike]], respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Levin|first=Matt|date=2015-09-23|title=Despite 'forgotten' status, Hurricane Rita ravaged southeast Texas|url=https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/texas/article/Despite-forgotten-status-Hurricane-Rita-6525187.php|access-date=2022-02-18|website=Chron|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-09-12|title=10 years later: Remembering Hurricane Ike|url=https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/10-years-later-Remembering-Hurricane-Ike-13223296.php|access-date=2022-02-18|website=Beaumont Enterprise|language=en-US}}</ref> Mandatory evacuations were issued in advance of both storms.

Beaumont lies on Texas' coastal plain, about {{convert|30|mi|km}} inland from the [[Gulf of Mexico]], {{convert|85|mi}} east of [[Houston]], and just south of the dense pine forests of [[East Texas]]. The city is bordered on the east by the [[Neches River]] and to the north by [[Pine Island Bayou]]. Before being settled, the area was crisscrossed by numerous small streams. Most of these streams have since been filled in or converted for drainage purposes. The island directly across from Riverfront Park is called Trinity Island. There are also three other islands in the Neches River around the [[Downtown Beaumont|downtown]] area/port: Harbor, Smith and Clark. Beaumont is relatively flat compared to other Texas cites at being 16&nbsp;ft. above sea level. South of Beaumont, Port Arthur is only 7&nbsp;ft. above sea level.

===Annexations===
Several towns and communities have been absorbed into the city of Beaumont. These include: Amelia, established in 1885 and incorporated into Beaumont in 1956; Elizabeth, the depot of Amelia that was established around 1903 or after and annexed into Beaumont in 1957; Elwood, established sometimes in the late 1800s, changed to Voth in 1902, and annexed into Beaumont in 1957; Guffey, post office was established in 1901 and closed in 1925 but is part of Beaumont now; Santa Anna, became part of Beaumont when it was founded; Tevis Bluff, became part of Beaumont when it was founded in 1835.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Republic of Texas Land Grants'', "Jefferson County Towns and Communities"|url=https://www.co.jefferson.tx.us/historical_commission/files/History/Jefferson_County_History_2015-12-03.pdf|publisher=Texas historical Commission|page= 68|access-date=December 14, 2019}}</ref>

The second [[oil boom]] of 1925 brought more people and wealth to Beaumont, the same year the 12-story American National Bank Building (now [[Orleans Building]]), was erected, and in 1926 Forrest Goodhue built the 12-story [[Goodhue Building]] which included a penthouse. In 1928, the Edson Hotel was built. No other buildings were built until Century Tower in 1962 and in 1982 Edison Plaza was built. In 1994 the 12-story LaSalle Hotel, built in 1927, was demolished.

The [[Jefferson Theatre]] was built in 1927 by the Jefferson Amusement Company for $1 million and was Beaumont's showpiece for many years. In 1928 the City Hall and Auditorium was built. It is now the [[Julie Rogers Theater]].

=== Pollution ===
The Beaumont–Port Arthur region has historically been cited as one of the most polluted urban areas in the United States due to various energy industries and chemical plants in the area. Even so, {{as of|2014|July|lc=y}}, the Beaumont-Port Arthur region was not under any [[Environmental Protection Agency]] non-attainment restrictions; however, counties in the [[Greater Houston]] area, the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex]], and [[El Paso]] were.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Green Book Nonattainment Areas for Criteria Pollutants As of July 02, 2014 |url=http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/greenbk/index.html |access-date=October 2, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023194528/http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/greenbk/index.html |archive-date=October 23, 2014 }}</ref> {{as of|2014|October}}, the Beaumont-Port Arthur area was not under any [[Texas Commission on Environmental Quality]] attainment compliance deadlines.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beaumont-Port Arthur: Current Attainment Status|url=http://www.tceq.texas.gov/airquality/sip/bpa/bpa-status|publisher=Texas Commission on Environmental Quality|access-date=October 2, 2014}}</ref> Regardless, according to an article published in 2007 focusing on [[Port Arthur, Texas|Port Arthur]], a neighboring city to the southeast of Beaumont, pollution was believed to have caused some area residents to become sick.

[[Hurricane Rita]] in 2005 and [[Hurricane Ike]] in 2008 both caused significant damage.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-08-24 |title=Hurricane Rita, 15 years later |url=https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/slideshow/Hurricane-Rita-15-years-later-207373.php |access-date=2022-06-21 |website=Beaumont Enterprise |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Wallach |first=Dan |date=2016-09-13 |title=8 years ago, Hurricane Ike powered through Southeast Texas |url=https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/weather/article/8-years-ago-Hurricane-Ike-powered-through-9219448.php |access-date=2022-06-21 |website=Beaumont Enterprise |language=en-US}}</ref> Both [[Hurricane Harvey]] in 2017 and [[Tropical Storm Imelda]] in 2019 caused historic flooding throughout the city.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lam |first=John Bacon and Kristin |title='Worse than Hurricane Harvey': At least 2 dead as Imelda overwhelms Texas with' incredibly dangerous' flooding |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/09/19/texas-flooding-storm-imelda-hits-winnie-beaumont-dangerous-rain/2372220001/ |access-date=2022-06-21 |website=USA TODAY |language=en-US}}</ref> [[Hurricane Laura]] in 2020 posed a significant threat to the town,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Garnham |first=Juan Pablo |date=2020-08-26 |title=Still recovering from Harvey, Texans in Beaumont and Port Arthur are now preparing for a new hurricane during the pandemic |url=https://www.texastribune.org/2020/08/26/hurricane-laura-beaumont-port-arthur-texas/ |access-date=2022-06-21 |website=The Texas Tribune |language=en}}</ref> as it was forecasted to make landfall at the border of Texas and Louisiana, almost following the same track as Hurricane Rita in 2005.

The region currently has no [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] member station of its own; [[KUHT]] on channel 8 (licensed to Houston, which is carried on cable and satellite providers in most of the market) and KLTL on channel 20 (a [[Louisiana Public Broadcasting]] affiliate licensed to Lake Charles, which is carried on cable providers in the market's extreme eastern portions) do not reach the area. KUHT has a construction permit for a digital translator on RF 24, which would share KFDM's antenna on 25, but the University of Houston has had financial cutbacks and recently cancelled a translator application in Victoria. What outcome this will have on the Beaumont facility remains to be seen.

=== Radio ===

Radio stations that were licensed in the [[Greater Houston]] area (mainly the [[Senior Road Tower]]) are barely perceptible in most of the Beaumont area.
