[[Native Americans in the United States|Humans]] have inhabited the area for several millennia, with the Sioux becoming dominant by the early 19th century. In the late 19th century, European-American settlement intensified after a [[Black Hills Gold Rush|gold rush]] in the Black Hills and the construction of railroads from the east. Encroaching miners and settlers triggered a number of [[American Indian Wars|Indian wars]], ending with the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] in 1890. As the southern part of the former [[Dakota Territory]], South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with [[North Dakota]]. They are the 39th and 40th states admitted to the union; President [[Benjamin Harrison]] shuffled the statehood papers before signing them so that no one could tell which became a state first.<ref>Mark Stein, ''How the States Got Their Shapes'', Smithsonian Books/Harper Collins, 2008. p. 256.</ref>

Key events in the 20th century included the [[Dust Bowl]] and [[Great Depression]], increased federal spending during the 1940s and 1950s for agriculture and defense, and an industrialization of agriculture that has reduced family farming. Eastern South Dakota is home to most of the state's population, and the area's fertile soil is used to grow a variety of crops. West of the Missouri River, [[ranch]]ing is the predominant agricultural activity, and the economy is more dependent on tourism and defense spending. Most of the Native American reservations are in [[West River (South Dakota)|West River]]. The [[Black Hills]], a group of low pine-covered mountains sacred to the Sioux, is in the southwest part of the state. [[Mount Rushmore]], a major tourist destination, is there. South Dakota has a temperate [[continental climate]], with four distinct seasons and precipitation ranging from moderate in the east to semi-arid in the west. The state's ecology features species typical of a North American [[grassland]] biome.

While several [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] have represented South Dakota for multiple terms in both chambers of [[Congress (United States)|Congress]], the state government is largely controlled by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], whose nominees have carried South Dakota in each of the last 14 [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]]. Historically dominated by an agricultural economy and a rural lifestyle, South Dakota has recently sought to diversify its economy in other areas to both attract and retain residents. South Dakota's history and rural character still strongly influence the state's culture.

{{For timeline}}

=== Early history ===
Humans have lived in what is today South Dakota for several thousand years. The first inhabitants were [[Paleoindian]] hunter-gatherers, and disappeared from the area around 5000 BC.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bjorklund |first1=Ruth |last2=Horn |first2=Geoffrey |last3=Klepeis |first3=Alicia |title=South Dakota: Third Edition |year=2016 |publisher=Cavendish Square Publishing LLC |isbn=9781627132244 |pages=23, 43 |edition=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o1hmDwAAQBAJ}}</ref> Between 500&nbsp;AD and 800&nbsp;AD, a semi-nomadic people known as the Mound Builders lived in central and eastern South Dakota. In the 14th century, the [[Crow Creek Massacre]] occurred, in which several hundred men, women, and children were killed near the [[Missouri River]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Straub |first1=Patrick |last2=Griffith |first2=Tom |title=It Happened in South Dakota |date=2016 |pages=1–4 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=9781493023585 |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObIzDQAAQBAJ}}</ref>

By 1500, the [[Arikara]] (or Ree) had settled in much of the Missouri River valley.<ref>Schell, pp. 16–18.</ref> European contact with the area began in 1743, when the [[Louis-Joseph Gaultier de La Vérendrye|LaVérendrye]] brothers explored the region. The LaVérendrye group buried a plate near the site of modern-day [[Pierre, South Dakota|Pierre]], claiming the region for France as part of [[Louisiana (New France)|greater Louisiana]].<ref>Schell, pp. 28–29.</ref> In 1762 the entire region became part of the [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish Louisiana]] until 1802.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349302/Louisiana-Purchase|title=Louisiana Purchase—History, Facts, & Map|access-date=December 31, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501010249/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349302/Louisiana-Purchase|archive-date=May 1, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knowla.org/entry/773/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403103905/http://www.knowla.org/entry/773/|archive-date=April 3, 2014|title=Spanish Colonial Louisiana—Know Louisiana}}</ref> By the early 19th century, the [[Sioux]] had largely replaced the Arikara as the dominant group in the area.<ref>Schell, pp. 18–21.</ref>

=== American settlement and statehood ===
In 1803, the United States purchased the [[Louisiana Territory]], an area that included most of South Dakota, from [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], and President [[Thomas Jefferson]] organized the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] to explore the region.<ref>Thompson (ed.), pp. 56–57.</ref> In 1817, an American fur trading post was set up at present-day [[Fort Pierre, South Dakota|Fort Pierre]], beginning continuous American settlement of the area.<ref name="SDChrono">{{cite web| title = Chronology of South Dakota History | publisher=South Dakota Historical Society | access-date =September 3, 2007 | url = http://www.sdhistory.org/soc/soc_hist.htm |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070901170704/http://www.sdhistory.org/soc/soc_hist.htm |archive-date = September 1, 2007}}</ref> In 1855, the U.S. Army bought [[Fort Pierre, South Dakota|Fort Pierre]] but abandoned it in 1857 in favor of [[Fort Randall]] to the south.<ref name="SDChrono" /> Settlement by Americans and Europeans was by this time increasing rapidly, and in 1858 the [[Yankton Sioux]] signed the [[List of United States treaties|1858 Treaty]], ceding most of present-day eastern South Dakota to the United States.<ref>{{cite book |year=1993 |title=Yankton Sioux Tribe and Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska Development Trust Fund Act and to Authorize the Construction of a Reconciliation Place in Fort Pierre, SD: Hearing Before the Committee on Indian Affairs, United States Senate, One Hundred Sixth Congress, Second Session on S. 1148 ...

A growing population in the Dakota Territory caused political dissatisfaction between northern and southern territory residents, with the southern half being always more populated. Following the territorial capital being moved from Yankton to [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]] in the northern part, calls for dividing the territory increased. South Dakota held constitutional conventions in 1883, 1885, and 1889.<ref>{{cite book |title=South Dakota Historical Collections |date=1908 |publisher=South Dakota State Historical Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXkSAAAAYAAJ&dq=constitutional+convention+South+Dakota+1883&pg=PA29 |language=en}}</ref>
Eventually, in the 1887 general election, Dakota Territory residents voted for the division, so it was divided in half and President [[Benjamin Harrison]] signed proclamations formally admitting South Dakota and North Dakota to the union on November 2, 1889.<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Now You Know: Why Are There Two Dakotas? |url=https://time.com/4377423/dakota-north-south-history-two/ |access-date=April 7, 2022 |magazine=Time |language=en |archive-date=April 8, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220408084549/https://time.com/4377423/dakota-north-south-history-two/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=October 17, 2015 |title=Moving Toward Statehood {{!}} North Dakota Studies |url=http://www.ndstudies.gov/content/moving-toward-statehood |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017234846/http://www.ndstudies.gov/content/moving-toward-statehood |archive-date=2015-10-17 |access-date=April 7, 2022 }}</ref><ref>Schell, p. 222.</ref><ref name="Thompson116">Thompson (ed.), pp. 115–116.</ref> Harrison had the papers shuffled to obscure which one was signed first and the order went unrecorded.<ref name="Thompson116" /><ref name="richardson">{{cite book|author=Heather Cox Richardson|date=November 25, 2013|title=Wounded Knee: Party Politics and the Road to an American Massacre|publisher=Basic Books|page=101|quote="On February 22, 1889, outgoing President Cleveland signed an omnibus bill that divided the Territory of Dakota in half.

The four new states would be admitted into the Union in nine months. This plan cut Democratic New Mexico out of statehood, and split Republican Dakota Territory into two new Republican states. Rather than two new Republican states and two new Democratic states that Congress had considered the previous year, the omnibus bill created three new Republican states and one new Democratic state that Republicans thought they would capture. In their eagerness to admit both Dakotas, Republican congressmen also ignored the uncomfortable fact that much of the land in the anticipated state of South Dakota belonged to the Sioux|isbn=9780465025114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Zi4H7SsSugC}}{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

On December 29, 1890, the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] occurred on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]]. Commonly cited as the last major armed conflict between the United States and the [[Lakota Sioux|Lakota Sioux Nation]], the massacre resulted in the deaths of at least 146 Sioux, many of them women and children.<ref name="Schell304">Schell, pp. 304–305.</ref> 31 U.S. soldiers were also killed in the conflict.<ref name="Schell304" />

During the 1930s, several economic and climatic conditions combined with disastrous results for South Dakota. A lack of rainfall, extremely high temperatures and inappropriate cultivation techniques produced what was known as the [[Dust Bowl]] in South Dakota and several other plains states. Fertile [[topsoil]] was blown away in massive dust storms, and several harvests were completely ruined.<ref>{{cite web| title = Drought in the Dust Bowl Years | publisher=National Drought Mitigation Center | access-date =April 4, 2007 | url = http://drought.unl.edu/whatis/dustbowl.htm | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070329183000/http://www.drought.unl.edu/whatis/dustbowl.htm<!--Added by H3llBot--> | archive-date =March 29, 2007}}</ref> The experiences of the Dust Bowl, coupled with local bank [[foreclosure]]s and the general economic effects of the [[Great Depression]], resulted in many South Dakotans leaving the state. The population of South Dakota declined by more than 7% between 1930 and 1940.<ref>{{cite web | title = Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990 | publisher = United States Census Bureau | access-date = December 14, 2008 | url = https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/sd190090.txt | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081228081313/http://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/sd190090.txt | archive-date = December 28, 2008 | url-status = live }}</ref>

Economic stability returned with the U.S. entry into [[World War II]] in 1941, when demand for the state's agricultural and industrial products grew as the nation mobilized for war.<ref>Schell, pp. 317–320.</ref> In 1944, the [[Pick–Sloan Plan]] was passed as part of the [[Flood Control Act of 1944]] by the U.S. Congress, resulting in the construction of six large dams on the Missouri River, four of which are at least partially in South Dakota.<ref name="Schell323">Schell, pp. 323–325.</ref> Flood control, [[hydroelectricity]], and recreational opportunities such as boating and fishing are provided by the dams and their reservoirs.<ref name="Schell323" />

In recent decades, South Dakota has been transformed from a state dominated by agriculture to one with a more diversified economy. The tourism industry has grown considerably since the mid-twentieth century, with the [[Black Hills]] becoming more important as a destination. The financial service industry began to grow in the state as well, with [[Citibank]] moving its credit card operations from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota|Sioux Falls]] in 1981, a move that has been followed by several other financial companies. South Dakota was the first state to eliminate [[Usury#Usury statutes in the United States|caps on interest rates]].<ref name="Citibank">Hetland, Cara.

The [[Missouri River]] is the largest and longest river in the state. Other major South Dakota rivers include the [[Cheyenne River|Cheyenne]], [[James River (Dakotas)|James]], [[Big Sioux River|Big Sioux]], and [[White River (Missouri River)|White]] Rivers. Eastern South Dakota has many natural lakes, mostly created by periods of glaciation.<ref name=Thompson1718>Thompson (ed.), pp. 17–18.</ref> Additionally, dams on the Missouri River create four large reservoirs: [[Oahe Dam|Lake Oahe]], [[Lake Sharpe]], [[Lake Francis Case]], and [[Lewis and Clark Lake]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sdmissouririver.com/follow-the-river/the-four-lakes-and-dams/ |title=The Four Lakes and Dams |publisher=South Dakota Missouri River Tourism |date= |access-date=2022-08-12}}</ref>

===Regions and geology===

South Dakota can generally be divided into three regions: eastern South Dakota, western South Dakota, and the [[Black Hills]].<ref>Thompson (ed.), p. 14.</ref> The Missouri River serves as a boundary in terms of geographic, social, and political differences between eastern and western South Dakota. The geography of the Black Hills, long considered sacred by Native Americans, differs from its surroundings to such an extent it can be considered separate from the rest of western South Dakota. At times the Black Hills are combined with the rest of western South Dakota, and people often refer to the resulting two regions divided by the Missouri River as [[West River (South Dakota)|West River]] and [[East River (South Dakota)|East River]].<ref name=eastwestriver/><ref name=NYTimesEastWest/>
[[File:Badlands panorama1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Badlands National Park]]]]

Eastern South Dakota generally features higher precipitation and lower topography than the western part of the state. Smaller geographic regions of this area include the [[Coteau des Prairies]], the [[Dissected Till Plains]], and the James River Valley. The Coteau des Prairies is a plateau bordered on the east by the [[Minnesota River]] Valley and on the west by the James River Basin.<ref name=Thompson1718/> Further west, the James River Basin is mostly low, flat, highly eroded land, following the flow of the [[James River (Dakotas)|James River]] through South Dakota from north to south.<ref>Schell, pp. 4–6.</ref> The Dissected Till Plains, an area of rolling hills and fertile soil that covers much of Iowa and Nebraska, extends into the southeastern corner of South Dakota. Layers deposited during the [[Pleistocene]] epoch, starting around two million years ago, cover most of eastern South Dakota.<ref name=NSUgeology/> These are the youngest rock and sediment layers in the state, the product of several successive periods of [[glacier|glaciation]] which deposited a large amount of rocks and soil, known as [[till]], over the area.<ref name=pleistocene>{{cite web| title = Pleistocene Deposits | publisher=South Dakota Department of Environment & Natural Resources | access-date =November 28, 2008 | url = http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geology/pleistocene.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080116121210/http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geology/pleistocene.html | archive-date = January 16, 2008}}</ref>

The [[Great Plains]] cover most of the western two-thirds of South Dakota. West of the [[Missouri River]] the landscape becomes more arid and rugged, consisting of rolling hills, plains, ravines, and steep flat-topped hills called [[butte]]s.<ref>Schell, p. 6.</ref> In the south, east of the Black Hills, lie the South Dakota [[Badlands National Park|Badlands]]. Erosion from the Black Hills, marine skeletons which fell to the bottom of a large shallow sea that once covered the area, and volcanic material all contribute to the geology of this area.<ref name=NSUgeology/><ref name=mesozoic>{{cite web| title = Mesozoic Formations | publisher=South Dakota Department of Environment & Natural Resources | access-date =November 28, 2008 | url = http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geology/mesozoic.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080213170116/http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geology/mesozoic.html | archive-date = February 13, 2008}}</ref><ref name=tertiary>{{cite web| title = Tertiary Formations | publisher=South Dakota Department of Environment & Natural Resources | access-date =November 28, 2008 | url = http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geology/tertiary.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070925065217/http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geology/tertiary.html | archive-date = September 25, 2007}}</ref>

===Growth and rural flight===

Over the last several decades, the population in many rural areas has declined in South Dakota, in common with other Great Plains states. The change has been characterized as "[[rural flight]]" as family farming has declined. Young people have moved to cities for other employment. This trend has continued in recent years, with 30 of South Dakota's counties losing population between the 1990 and the 2000 census.<ref name=ODriscoll>[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/census/sd.htm O'Driscoll, Patrick.

The effect of rural flight has not been spread evenly through South Dakota, however.

Several other cities in the state also have commercial air service: [[Aberdeen Regional Airport]], [[Pierre Regional Airport]], and [[Watertown Regional Airport]], some of which are subsidized by the [[Essential Air Service]] program.<ref>{{cite web | title = What is Essential Air Service? | publisher = United States Department of Transportation | access-date = December 13, 2008 | url = http://ntl.bts.gov/lib/1000/1500/1548/eas.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081217015828/http://ntl.bts.gov/lib/1000/1500/1548/eas.pdf | archive-date = December 17, 2008 | url-status = live }}</ref>

Public transit played a large role in the development of cities in South Dakota. There were seven cities with a streetcar system in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, however, all of these were discontinued over time. Today, only three fixed route public transit systems exist in the state, those being in [[Sioux Area Metro|Sioux Falls]], [[Rapid City Rapid Ride|Rapid City]] and on the [[YST Transit|Yankton Reservation]].

===Government===

{{See also|Governor of South Dakota|South Dakota Legislature|South Dakota Supreme Court}}

Like other U.S. states, the structure of the government of South Dakota follows the same [[separation of powers]] as the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], with executive, [[Legislature|legislative]], and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches. The structure of the state government is laid out in the [[Constitution of South Dakota]], the highest law in the state.

[[Laura Ingalls Wilder]], whose semi-autobiographical books are based on her experiences as a child and young adult on the frontier, is one of South Dakota's best-known writers. She drew from her life growing up on a homestead near [[De Smet, South Dakota|De Smet]] as the basis for five of her novels: ''[[By the Shores of Silver Lake]]'', ''[[The Long Winter (novel)|The Long Winter]]'', ''[[Little Town on the Prairie]]'', ''[[These Happy Golden Years]]'', and ''[[The First Four Years (novel)|The First Four Years]]''.<ref>{{cite web| title = Laura's History | publisher=Laura Ingalls Wilder Historic Home and Museum | access-date =December 19, 2008 | url = http://www.lauraingallswilderhome.com/history1.htm | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20081201053959/http://www.lauraingallswilderhome.com/history1.htm<!--Added by H3llBot--> | archive-date =December 1, 2008}}</ref> These gained renewed popularity in the United States when ''Little House on the Prairie'' was adapted and produced as a television series in 1974. Wilder's daughter, [[Rose Wilder Lane]], who became a well-known writer in her own right, was born near De Smet in 1886.

South Dakota has also produced several notable artists. [[Harvey Dunn]] grew up on a homestead near [[Manchester, South Dakota|Manchester]] in the late 19th century. While Dunn worked most of his career as a commercial illustrator, his most famous works showed various scenes of frontier life; he completed these near the end of his career.<ref>Hasselstrom, pp. 34–36.</ref> [[Oscar Howe]] ([[Crow]]) was born on the [[Crow Creek Indian Reservation]] and won fame for his watercolor paintings.<ref>Hasselstrom, pp. 215–217.</ref> Howe was one of the first Native American painters to adopt techniques and style heavily influenced by the mid-20th century [[abstraction]] movement, rather than relying on traditional Native American styles. [[Terry Redlin]], originally from [[Watertown, South Dakota|Watertown]], was an accomplished painter of rural and wildlife scenes. Many of his works are on display at the [[Redlin Art Center]] in Watertown.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sdhalloffame.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=36&Itemid=78&iid=410 | title = Terry Redlin | publisher = South Dakota Hall of Fame | access-date = May 11, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719104714/http://www.sdhalloffame.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=36&Itemid=78&iid=410 | archive-date = July 19, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>
