==History==
The area of Kasukabe was part of ancient [[Musashi Province]] and has been settled since at least the [[Jomon period]] as evidenced by many [[midden#shell midden|shell middens]] and ancient burial mounds. During the [[Edo period]], Kasukabe prospered as a [[shukuba|post station]] on the [[Nikkō Kaidō]] highway linking [[Edo]] with [[Nikkō]].

On April 1, 1944, Kasukabe annexed the neighboring village of Uchimaki. On July 1, 1954, Kasukabe was elevated to city status after annexing the villages of Toyoharu, Takesato, Komatsu and Toyono. On October 1, 2005, old Kasukabe city and the town of [[Shōwa, Saitama|Shōwa]] (from [[Kitakatsushika District, Saitama|Kitakatsushika District]]) were merged into the new and expanded city of Kasukabe. Kasukabe was elevated to [[Special cities of Japan|special city]] status on April 1, 2008, giving it increased local autonomy.

Kasukabe is home to what was formerly one of the two [[Central Group|Robinsons]] department stores in Japan, which became a [[Seibu Department Stores|Seibu department store]] in March 2013.

However, Seibu is scheduled to close its doors due to a shortage of business, likely caused by competition with Aeon Mall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.saitama-np.co.jp/news/2015/10/09/02.html |title=西武春日部店、閉店へ…３０年の歴史に幕 イオンモール春日部の影響 |access-date=2015-10-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119183830/http://www.saitama-np.co.jp/news/2015/10/09/02.html |archive-date=2015-11-19 }}</ref>
