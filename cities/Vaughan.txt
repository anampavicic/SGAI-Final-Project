==Toponymy==
The township was named after [[Benjamin Vaughan]], a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] commissioner who signed a peace treaty with the [[United States]] in 1783.

==History==

In the late pre-contact period, the [[Wyandot people|Huron]]-Wendat people populated what is today Vaughan. The Skandatut ancestral Wendat village overlooked the east branch of the [[Humber River (Ontario)|Humber River]] (Pine Valley Drive) and was once home to approximately 2,000 Huron in the sixteenth century.<ref>Salvage excavations of nationally significant Huron sites in Vaughan continue into 2010.

The first [[Europe]]an to pass through Vaughan was the [[Kingdom of France|French]] explorer [[Étienne Brûlé]], who traversed the Humber Trail in 1615. However, it was not until [[Township (Canada)|townships]] were created in 1792 that Vaughan began to see European settlements, as it was considered to be extremely remote and the lack of roads through the region made travel difficult.

Despite the hardships of [[settler|pioneer]] life, settlers came to Vaughan in considerable numbers. The population grew from 19 men, 5 women, and 30 children in 1800 to 4,300 in 1840. The first people to arrive were mainly [[Pennsylvania Dutch|Pennsylvania Germans]], with a smaller number of families of [[England|English]] descent and a group of [[France|French]] [[House of Bourbon|Royalists]]. This migration from the [[United States]] was by 1814 superseded by immigrants from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. While many of their predecessors had been agriculturalists, the newer immigrants were highly skilled tradespeople, useful for a growing [[community]].

Among the facilities established by this group were a number of hamlets, the oldest of which was [[Thornhill, Ontario|Thornhill]], where a sawmill was erected in 1801, a grist mill in 1815, and had a population of 300 by 1836. Other such enclaves included ''[[Kleinburg]], Coleraine, [[Maple, Ontario|Rupertville]]''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://images.ourontario.ca/Partners/RHPL/RHPL003215301pf_0002.pdf|title=Historical Notes on Maple|last=Rumble|first=Mrs. Arnold|date=1948-10-28|work=The Liberal|access-date=2018-12-14|location=Richmond Hill, Ontario|page=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181218020521/http://images.ourontario.ca/Partners/RHPL/RHPL003215301pf_0002.pdf|archive-date=2018-12-18|url-status=live}}</ref>''[[Maple, Ontario|(Maple)]], [[Richmond Hill, Ontario|Richmond Hill]], Teston, [[Clairville, Toronto|Claireville]], [[Pine Grove, Regional Municipality of York, Ontario|Pine Grove]], Carrville, Patterson, Burlington, [[Concord, Ontario|Concord]], Edgeley, Fisherville, Elder's Mills, Elgin Mills, Jefferson, Nashville, Purpleville, Richvale, Sherwood, Langstaff, Vellore'', and ''Burwick ([[Woodbridge, Ontario|Woodbridge]])''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Vaughan Township Churches|last1=Somerville|first1=Patricia|last2=Macfarlane|first2=Catherine|publisher=Vaughan Township Historical Society|year=1984|isbn=0-9692207-0-7|location=Maple, Ontario}}</ref>

In 1846, the Township was primarily agricultural but had a population of 4,300. There were six grist mills and 25 saw mills.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

However, [[World War II]] sparked an influx of immigration, and by 1960, the population stood at 15,957. The ethnocultural composition of the area began to change with the arrival of different groups such as [[Italy|Italians]], [[Jew]]s and [[Eastern Europe]]ans.

Incorporated in 1850 as ''Vaughan Township,'' a municipal government was established. [[Vaughan Road]] was a historic road constructed in 1850 that linked Vaughan Township with [[Toronto]]. It incorporated parts of present-day [[Dufferin Street]] north of [[Eglinton Avenue]] in Toronto, though all that remains of it today is the separate alignment farther south, running through the eastern half of the former [[York, Toronto|City of York]].<ref name="lostrivers">{{cite web

Two F2 tornadoes tore through the city of Vaughan during the [[Southern Ontario Tornado Outbreak of 2009|Southern Ontario Tornado Outbreak]] on August 20, 2009. Premier [[Dalton McGuinty]] and Mayor [[Linda Jackson (politician)|Linda Jackson]] toured the destruction the next day and reported 200 homes in critical shape and as many as 600 additional homes likely to be demolished. The tornadoes also ripped up trees, flipped cars, and left thousands of people without electricity.

North American telephone customers placing calls to Vaughan may not recognize the charge details on their billings. Although Vaughan has been a single municipality since 1971, the local [[incumbent local exchange carrier]], [[Bell Canada]], splits the city into three historical rate centres–[[Kleinburg]], [[Maple, Ontario|Maple]] and Woodbridge. Part of the [[Thornhill, Ontario|Thornhill]] rate centre extends into Vaughan. Indeed, Vaughan does not even appear in the telephone book.

==Mayor and councillors==
[[File:VaughanCityHall17.jpg|thumb|right|Vaughan City Hall]]

Vaughan is governed by a [[Vaughan City Council|ten-member council]] comprising a mayor, four regional councillors, and five local councillors. The mayor, elected at large, is the head of the council and a representative on [[Regional Municipality of York, Ontario|York Region Council]]. The four regional councillors are also elected at large, and serve on both the city council and York Regional Council. Five local councillors are also elected, one from each of Vaughan's five wards, to represent those wards on Vaughan Council.

City councillors meet at Vaughan City Hall, located in Maple. The city's City Hall was opened on September 25, 2011, and is named in memory of late Mayor [[Lorna Jackson]]. The new Civic Centre is one of the first in Canada to conform to a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Gold Standard, the second highest environmental classification available.<ref name="LEED">{{cite web

Vaughan is the first municipality in Ontario to have a Youth City Councillor. The youth city councillor is appointed as a non-voting member of Council every six months to represent the youth of Vaughan. Vaughan council originally rejected the proposal of a youth councillor but, after the Vaughan Youth Cabinet amended its proposal, Council accepted the recommendation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amm.mb.ca/PDF/Magazine/Fall2005/diversity.pdf |title=Youth in Politics Article |access-date=2012-01-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205010827/http://www.amm.mb.ca/PDF/Magazine/Fall2005/diversity.pdf |archive-date=2012-02-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

After serving as mayor for nine years, [[Lorna Jackson]] saw the Town of Vaughan become incorporated as the City of Vaughan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.livingrealty.com/2016/09/city-of-vaughan-celebrates-25th-anniversary/|title=City of Vaughan Celebrates 25 Years since Incorporation|date=2016-09-27|work=GTA Real Estate News {{!}} Presented by Living Realty|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204182315/https://news.livingrealty.com/2016/09/city-of-vaughan-celebrates-25th-anniversary/|archive-date=2018-02-04|url-status=live}}</ref> Following the death of Mayor Lorna Jackson in 2002, [[Michael Di Biase]] was appointed mayor by Vaughan council by virtue of his position as one of two regional councillors representing Vaughan, Joyce Frustaglio was the other regional councillor. Gino Rosati, a Vaughan local councillor, was subsequently appointed by Vaughan Council to fill Di Biase's position as regional councillor and a by-election was held to fill Rosati's local councillor's position which was won by [[Linda Jackson (politician)|Linda Jackson]], the daughter of Mayor Jackson. Di Biase first became involved in the city's politics in 1985, when he was elected as a local councillor in 1985. Di Biase retained the mayorship in the [[2003 Vaughan municipal election|2003 municipal election]], defeating challenger Robert Craig.

In the [[2006 Vaughan municipal election|municipal election]] on November 13, 2006, Di Biase was narrowly defeated by Linda Jackson, who was sworn in as mayor on December 4, 2006. On June 18, 2008, an audit of Jackson's 2006 campaign finances found that the politician exceeded her legal spending limit of $120,419 by at least $12,356, or 10 per cent. The auditors, LECG Canada Ltd., say that amount could almost double if what they believed to be unreported contributions in kind at various election events&nbsp;but couldn't prove&nbsp;are later verified.<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/vaughan-mayor-to-face-election-financing-charges-1.738818 Vaughan mayor to face election-financing charges] CBC News 25 June 2008</ref>

They also found other apparent contraventions of the [[Canada Elections Act]], including at least five instances where associated companies made donations that exceeded the normal $750 donation limit per company.

On June 24, 2008, Vaughan Council voted unanimously to hire a special prosecutor to consider laying charges against Mayor Linda Jackson under the Municipal Elections Act in reaction to the auditors' report. Council hired Timothy Wilkin, "an expert in municipal law" to decide what if any charges are to be laid.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/448803 Vaughan mayor faces charges over election] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021011017/http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/448803 |date=2012-10-21 }} Phinjo Gombu, Toronto Star 25 June 2008.</ref> If Jackson is charged and found guilty, she would face punishments ranging from fines to removal from office.{{Update inline|date=July 2019|reason=}}

Subsequently, an audit was conducted on former Mayor Di Biase's 2006 election campaign funds. This exposed 27 contraventions under the Elections Act, along with a $155,000 anonymous cash payment made to his lawyer to cover his legal fees. Di Biase has refused to disclose who made this payment.<ref>[http://www.yorkregion.com/article/96804 Former Vaughan mayor Di Biase faces 27 election-related charges] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222073048/http://www.yorkregion.com/article/96804 |date=2012-02-22 }} Caroline Grech, Yorkregion.com 17 Sept 2009</ref>

On 25 October 2010, longtime [[Member of Parliament (Canada)|MP]] [[Maurizio Bevilacqua]] was elected mayor and he assumed office in December 2010.

On 24 October 2022, former [[Ontario Liberal Party]] leader [[Steven Del Duca]] was elected mayor; he assumed office on November 15, 2022.

== Geography ==
Vaughan is bounded by [[Caledon, Ontario|Caledon]] and [[Brampton, Ontario|Brampton]] to the west, [[King, Ontario|King]] and [[Richmond Hill, Ontario|Richmond Hill]] to the north, [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]] and Richmond Hill to the east, and [[Toronto]] — in the dissolved cities of [[Etobicoke]] and [[North York]], to the south.

=== Communities and identity===
The city is made up of nearly a dozen historic communities. Likely as a result of the municipality being established when it was still largely a rural area with scattered settlements, most residents (and even non-residents) identify more with the larger communities than they do with the city as a whole and have greatly expanded their areas, and the City officially designates five in the urban area as major communities, with all of the built-up areas of the city considered as being within one of them. This includes corporations such as [[Bell Canada]], which uses the original community [[rate centre]]s and lists them separately in the phone book, resulting in local calling areas being different throughout the city.

=== Vaughan Metropolitan Centre ===
[[File:Vaughan Metropolitan Centre aerial view 2022.jpg|thumb|Vaughan skyline]]
The [[Vaughan Metropolitan Centre]] is a new 179 hectare (442 acre) [[city centre]] under development around the intersection of [[List of numbered roads in York Region#Highway 7|Highway 7]] and [[List of north-south roads in Toronto#Jane Street|Jane Street]], at the site of the former hamlet of [[Edgeley, Ontario|Edgeley]].

When the Township of Vaughan officially became a town in 1971, it was made up four historic communities (Maple, Kleinburg, Thornhill, and Woodbridge) large enough to have their own village or town centres. Vaughan committed to building a new business and commercial core distinct from all of them. This commitment became policy in 1998 when Official Plan Amendment 500 called for the Vaughan Corporate Centre, as it was then branded, to become a focal point for business activity and major commercial development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vaughan.ca/services/business/official_plans/OPA/OPAs%20500%20-%20599/OPA%20500.pdf|title=Vaughan Corporate Centre OPA No. 500|date=March 30, 1998}}</ref>

It is served by the [[Vaughan Metropolitan Centre station|Vaughan Metropolitan Centre]] subway station, which is the northwestern terminus of [[Line 1 Yonge–University]] of the [[Toronto subway]] system. It is also a major transit hub for [[York Region Transit]] (YRT), as well as [[Viva Rapid Transit|Viva]] and [[Züm]] bus rapid transit services.<ref>{{Cite web|title = First Look: New TTC Map - Vaughan Metropolitan Centre|url = http://www.vaughanmetrocentre.ca/ttc-map/|website = Vaughan Metropolitan Centre|access-date = September 1, 2019|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190926064543/http://www.vaughanmetrocentre.ca/ttc-map/|archive-date = September 26, 2019|url-status = live}}</ref>

==Archaeology==

The Seed-Barker archeological site is a 16th-century [[Iroquoian|Iroquois]] village on the [[Humber River (Ontario)|Humber River]] in Vaughan. It has been used as a summer school field trip site since 1976 by the Boyd archeological field summer school for high school students. The school is sponsored by the York Region district school board in co-operation with the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] and the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA). In 1895, a local farmer began finding Iroquoian artifacts in the area. In 1895, Roland Orr recognized the classic ecological features favoured by the Iroquoian people for their villages: floodplains along a river, an easily defensible plateau and nearby forests. The Iroquois used the floodplains to plant maize, beans and squash,{{rp|1}} known as the three sisters. In the 1950s, University of Toronto professor Norman Emerson and the students excavated artifacts from the Seed-Baker site. Since 1975, more than a million artifacts were discovered and nineteen [[longhouse]]s were excavated revealing that the village was occupied by the Iroquois from c. 1500 - 1550 AD.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Bob |last1=Burgar |first2=Cathy |last2=Crinnion |title=The "dirt" on the TRCA's archaeology program |journal=Arch Notes |date=June 2005 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=14–15 |url=https://www.ontarioarchaeology.org/Resources/ArchNotes/anns10-3.pdf |access-date=July 28, 2019 |publisher=Ontario Archaeological Society |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190728142335/https://www.ontarioarchaeology.org/Resources/ArchNotes/anns10-3.pdf |archive-date=July 28, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>
