Odesa is a warm-water [[warm-water port|port]]. The city of Odesa hosts both the [[Port of Odesa]] and [[Pivdennyi Port|Port Pivdennyi]], a significant oil terminal situated in the city's suburbs. Another notable port, [[Port of Chornomorsk|Chornomorsk]], is located in the same [[oblast]], to the south-west of Odesa. Together they represent a major [[transport hub]] integrating with railways. Odesa's oil and chemical processing facilities are connected to the Russian and other European networks by strategic [[pipeline transport|pipelines]]. In 2000, the Quarantine Pier at Odesa Commercial Sea Port was declared a free port and [[free economic zone]] for a period of 25 years.

In 1795 the city was named Odessa in accordance with the [[Greek Plan]] of Empress Catherine II.

''Odessa'', the transliteration of the name from Russian, was the traditional English spelling of the city's name favoured before [[History of Ukraine|Ukraine's independence]] in 1991 (similarly to the spelling of [[Kyiv]] versus Kiev).

''Odesa'' became the internationally standardized Latin-alphabet transliteration of the Ukrainian name according to the [[Romanization of Ukrainian#Ukrainian National transliteration|Ukrainian National romanization system]], which was adopted for official use by Ukraine's cabinet in 2010, approved by the [[United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names|UN Group of Experts on

Odesa was the site of a large [[Greek colony|Greek settlement]] no later than the middle of the 6th century BC (a [[necropolis]] from the 5th–3rd centuries BC has long been known in this area). Some scholars believe it to have been a trade settlement established by the Greek city of [[Histria (ancient city)|Histria]]. Whether the Bay of Odesa is the ancient "Port of the Histrians" cannot yet be considered a settled question based on the available evidence.<ref>"The Greek Colonisation of the Black Sea Area: Historical Interpretation of Archaeology," December 1998, Tsetskhladze, Gocha R. (ed.), ''Franz Steiner Verlag'', p. 41, n. 116.</ref> [[Artifact (archaeology)|Archaeological artifacts]] confirm extensive links between the Odesa area and the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].

In the Middle Ages successive rulers of the Odesa region included various [[nomad]]ic tribes ([[Pechenegs|Petchenegs]], [[Cumans]]), the [[Golden Horde]], the [[Crimean Khanate]], the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Yedisan]] [[Crimean Tatars]] traded there in the 14th century.

Since the middle of the 13th century the city's territory belonged to the Golden Horde domain.<ref name=ehuver10>{{Cite web |last=Vermenych |first=Ya. |title= |script-title=uk:ОДЕСА |trans-title=Odesa |url=http://resource.history.org.ua/cgi-bin/eiu/history.exe?&I21DBN=EIU&P21DBN=EIU&S21STN=1&S21REF=10&S21FMT=eiu_all&C21COM=S&S21CNR=20&S21P01=0&S21P02=0&S21P03=TRN=&S21COLORTERMS=0&S21STR=Odesa_mst |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220329031231/http://resource.history.org.ua/cgi-bin/eiu/history.exe?&I21DBN=EIU&P21DBN=EIU&S21STN=1&S21REF=10&S21FMT=eiu_all&C21COM=S&S21CNR=20&S21P01=0&S21P02=0&S21P03=TRN=&S21COLORTERMS=0&S21STR=Odesa_mst |archive-date=29 March 2022 |access-date=16 July 2023 |website=Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine}}</ref> On Italian navigational maps of 14th century on the place of Odesa is indicated the castle of Ginestra, at the time the center of a [[Gazaria (Genoese colonies)|Gazarian]] colony of the [[Republic of Genoa]].<ref name=ehuver10/> During the reign of [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Hacı I Giray]] of [[Crimea]] (1441–1466), the Khanate was endangered by the Golden Horde and the Ottoman Turks and, in search of allies, the khan agreed to cede the area to Lithuania. The site of present-day Odesa was then a fortress known as [[Khadjibey]] (named for Hacı I Giray, and also spelled Kocibey in [[Modern English|English]], Hacıbey or Hocabey in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and Hacıbey in [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]]). Khadjibey was first mentioned in 1415 in Polish chronicles by [[Jan Długosz]], when a ship with grain sailed from there to Constantinople.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Історія Одеси.

[[Khadjibey]] came under direct control of the Ottoman Empire after 1529.<ref name=ehuver10/> In the mid-18th century, the Ottomans rebuilt the [[Fortification|fortress]] at Khadjibey (also known as Hocabey), which was named ''Yeni Dünya''<ref name=ehuver10/> (literally "New World").

=== Russian conquest of Sanjak of Özi (Ochakiv Oblast) ===
A [[History of the Russo-Turkish wars|series of wars]] between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire, as well as the demise of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, allowed Russia to start to fully exploit the ancient [[Black Sea trade and economy|Black Sea trade]] across the coastal area through the steppe across southern and eastern Ukraine, into the hinterland of [[East-Central Europe|East Central Europe]]. Stable commercial activity in this region in practice in the past required both security through the overland routes, and knowledge of where products could go overseas. In antiquity, various Greek colonies had taken this role, followed by the [[Varangians]] who established [[Kievan Rus']] in the 9th century, as well as various Italian colonies after the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]].{{r|Herlihy|page=1-3}} Under Catherine the Great, Russia gained, via the [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]], the lands where [[Mariupol]], [[Kherson]], and [[Mykolaiv]] would be founded. However, they were all handicapped in various ways relative to how much commercial interest there was. For example, the latter two cities were situated in lowlands near marshes, which provided for poor sanitary conditions in the technology available at that time.{{r|Herlihy|page=5}}

The sleepy fishing village of Odesa had witnessed a sea-change in its fortunes when the wealthy [[Magnates of Poland and Lithuania|magnate]] and future [[Kiev Voivodeship|Voivode of Kiev]] (1791), [[Antoni Protazy Potocki]], established trade routes through the port for the ''Polish Black Sea Trading Company'' and set up the infrastructure in the 1780s.<ref>Łubieński, Tomasz Wentworth.

During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792)|Russian-Turkish War of 1787–1792]],<ref name=ehuver10/> on 25 September 1789, a detachment of [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian forces]], including [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] under [[Alexander Suvorov]] and [[Ivan Gudovich]], took [[Khadjibey]] and Yeni Dünya for the [[Russian Empire]]. One section of the troops came under command of a [[Spanish people|Spaniard]] in Russian service, Irishman [[Major General]] [[José de Ribas]] (known in Russia as Osip Mikhailovich Deribas); today, the main street in Odesa, [[Deribasivska Street]], is named after him.

Russia formally gained possession of the Sanjak of Özi (Ochakiv Oblast){{sfn|Imperial|1848|p=183}} as a result of the [[Treaty of Jassy]] (Iaşi)<ref name=ehuver10/> in 1792 and it became a part of [[Yekaterinoslav Viceroyalty]]. The Russian Empire took full control of Crimea, as well as land between the [[Southern Bug]] and the [[Dniester]], including the [[Khadzhibey Estuary]] where the Turkish fortress of [[Khadjibey]] was located. The newly acquired Ochakov Oblast was promised to the Cossacks by the Russian government for resettlement.<ref>Yefimenko, Aleksandra.

By the Highest{{Clarify|date=March 2022}} [[rescript]] of 17 June 1792 addressed to General Kakhovsky it was ordered to establish the Dniester Border Line of fortresses.{{sfn|Imperial|1848|p=184}} The commander of the land forces in Ochakiv Oblast was appointed Graf (Count) [[Alexander Suvorov|Suvorov-Rymnikskiy]].{{sfn|Imperial|1848|p=184}} The main fortress was built near Sucleia at the mouth of [[Botna River|river Botna]] as the Head Dniester Fortress by Engineer-Major [[François Sainte de Wollant|de Wollant]].{{sfn|Imperial|1848|p=184}} Near the new fortress saw the formation of a new "Vorstadt" (suburb) where people moved from Sucleia and Parkan.{{sfn|Imperial|1848|p=184}} With the establishment of the Voznesensk Governorate on 27 January 1795, the Vorstadt was named [[Tiraspol]].{{sfn|Imperial|1848|p=184}}

The Flemish engineer working for the Russian Empress [[Catherine the Great]], José de Ribas's collaborator [[François Sainte de Wollant|Franz de Voland]] recommended the area of [[Khadjibey]] fortress as the site for the region's basic port: it had an ice-free harbor, breakwaters could be cheaply constructed that would render the harbor safe and it would have the capacity to accommodate large fleets. The Namestnik of Yekaterinoslav and Voznesensk, [[Platon Zubov]] (one of Catherine's favorites), supported this proposal. In 1794 Catherine issued a Rescript to José de Ribas: "Considering favorable [[Khadjibey]] location... I order to establish here a navy harbor and trading pierce..." and invested the first money (26.000 rubles) in construction. Franz de Voland drew up a plan that would end up being the city's plan.{{r|Herlihy|page=7}}

However, adjacent to the new official locality, a [[Moldavia]]n colony already existed, which by the end of the 18th century was an independent settlement named [[Moldavanka]]. Some local historians consider that the settlement predates Odesa by about thirty years and assert that the locality was founded by Moldavians who came to build the fortress of Yeni Dunia for the Ottomans and eventually settled in the area in the late 1760s, right next to the settlement of [[Khadjibey]], on what later became the Primorsky Boulevard. Another version posits that the settlement appeared after Odesa itself was founded, as a settlement of Moldavians, Greeks, and Albanians fleeing the Ottoman yoke.<ref name="Richardson, p.110">[[#Richardson|Richardson]], p. 110.</ref>

Under [[Paul I of Russia]], construction of Odesa was stopped, Franz de Voland was removed from the project, and José de Ribas was implicated in a plot to assassinate the Emperor. After Paul's assassination in 1801, the city resumed construction, and used a plan largely from de Voland's work. It was thus one of the few master planned cities in the Russian Empire. {{r|Herlihy|page=13}}

===Renaming of the settlement and establishment of sea port===
In 1795, [[Khadjibey]] was officially renamed with the feminine name "{{Lang|ru|Одесса}} ({{transliteration|ru|Odessa}})" after a Greek colony of Odessos that supposedly was located in the area. The first census that was conducted in Odesa was in 1797 which accounted for 3,455 people.<ref name=ehuver10/> Since 1795, the city had its own city magistrate, and since 1796 a city council of six members and the Odesa Commodity Exchange.<ref name=ehuver10/> In 1801, in Odesa had opened the first commercial bank.<ref name=ehuver10/> In 1803, the city accounted for 9,000 people.<ref name="ukrssrtronko">{{Cite web |last=Tronko |first=Petro |author-link=Petro Tronko |title= |script-title=uk:Виникнення і розвиток міста Одеса |trans-title=Creation and development of the city of Odesa |url=http://ukrssr.com.ua/odeska/viniknennya-i-rozvitok-mista-odesa |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230609064004/https://ukrssr.com.ua/odeska/viniknennya-i-rozvitok-mista-odesa |archive-date=9 June 2023 |access-date=16 July 2023 |language=uk-UA}}</ref>

In their settlement, also known as Novaya Slobodka, the Moldavians owned relatively small plots on which they built village-style houses and cultivated vineyards and gardens. What became Mykhailovsky Square was the center of this settlement and the site of its first [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox church]], the Church of the Dormition, built in 1821 close to the seashore, as well as a cemetery. Nearby stood the [[barracks|military barracks]] and the country houses (''[[dacha]]'') of the city's wealthy residents, including that of the [[Armand-Emmanuel de Vignerot du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu|Duc de Richelieu]], appointed by Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] as Governor of Odesa in 1803.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle= Richelieu, Armand Emmanuel Sophie Septemanie du Plessis, Duc de |volume= 23 | pages = 302&ndash;303 |short= 1}}</ref> Richelieu played a role during [[1812–1819 Ottoman plague epidemic|Ottoman plague epidemic]] which hit Odesa in the autumn 1812.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G6W32VE42L0C&dq=plague+Odessa+1812&pg=PA312|title=Travels in Russia, and a residence at St. Petersburg and Odessa, in the years 1827-1829|first=Edward|last=Morton|date=12 July 1830|publisher=Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green|via=Google Books|access-date=12 July 2022|archive-date=16 December 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231216035813/https://books.google.com/books?id=G6W32VE42L0C&dq=plague+Odessa+1812&pg=PA312#v=onepage&q=plague%20Odessa%201812&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://balkanist.net/plague-and-political-tyranny-odessa/|title=Odessa, 1812: Plague and Tyranny at the Edge of the Empire|date=5 December 2015|access-date=12 July 2022|archive-date=29 June 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220629030148/http://balkanist.net/plague-and-political-tyranny-odessa/|url-status=live}}</ref> Dismissive of any attempt to forge a compromise between quarantine requirements and free trade, Prince [[Alexey Kurakin|Kuriakin]] (the Saint Petersburg-based High Commissioner for Sanitation) countermanded Richelieu's orders.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QSd7DQAAQBAJ&dq=plague+Odessa+1812&pg=PA147|title=Migration and Disease in the Black Sea Region: Ottoman-Russian Relations in the Late Eighteenth and Early Nineteenth Centuries|first=Andrew|last=Robarts|date=1 December 2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781474259507|via=Google Books|access-date=12 July 2022|archive-date=16 December 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231216035813/https://books.google.com/books?id=QSd7DQAAQBAJ&dq=plague+Odessa+1812&pg=PA147#v=onepage&q=plague%20Odessa%201812&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the period from 1795 to 1814, the population of Odesa increased 15 times over and reached almost 20 thousand people. The first city plan was designed by the engineer F. Devollan in the late 18th century.<ref name="UKRWorld"/> Colonists of various ethnicities settled mainly in the area of the former colony, outside of the official boundaries, and as a consequence, in the first third of the 19th century, Moldavanka emerged as the dominant settlement. After planning by the official architects who designed buildings in Odesa's central district, such as the Italians Francesco Carlo Boffo and Giovanni Torricelli (see [[Italians of Odesa]]), Moldovanka was included in the general city plan, though the original grid-like plan of Moldovankan streets, lanes, and squares remained unchanged.<ref name="Richardson, p.110"/>

The new city quickly became a major success although initially, it received little state funding and privileges.<ref name="older settlements already">[http://ukrainianweek.com/History/123898 Odesa: Through Cossacks, Khans and Russian Emperors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024101327/http://ukrainianweek.com/History/123898 |date=24 October 2018 }}, [[The Ukrainian Week]] (18 November 2014)</ref> Its early growth owed much to the work of the [[Armand-Emmanuel de Vignerot du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu|Duc de Richelieu]], who served as the city's governor between 1803 and 1814. Having fled the [[French Revolution]], he had served in [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine's]] army against the Turks. He is credited with designing the city and organizing its amenities and infrastructure, and is considered{{by whom|date=August 2011}} one of the founding fathers of Odesa, together with another Frenchman, Count [[Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron|Andrault de Langeron]], who succeeded him in office.

Richelieu is commemorated by a [[bronze sculpture|bronze statue]], unveiled in 1828 to a design by [[Ivan Martos]]. His contributions to the city are mentioned by [[Mark Twain]] in his travelogue ''[[The Innocents Abroad|Innocents Abroad]]'': "I mention this statue and this stairway because they have their story. Richelieu founded Odessa – watched over it with paternal care – labored with a fertile brain and a wise understanding for its best interests – spent his fortune freely to the same end – endowed it with a sound prosperity, and one which will yet make it one of the great cities of the Old World".

In 1819, Odesa became a free port, a status it retained until 1859. Odesa became home to an extremely diverse population of Albanians, Armenians, Azeris, Bulgarians, Crimean Tatars, Frenchmen, Germans (including Mennonites), Greeks, Italians, Jews, Poles, Romanians, Russians, Turks, Ukrainians, and traders representing many other nationalities (hence numerous "ethnic" names on the city's map, for example ''Frantsuzky'' (French) and ''Italiansky'' (Italian) Boulevards, ''Grecheskaya'' (Greek), ''Yevreyskaya'' (Jewish), ''Arnautskaya'' (Albanian) Streets).

The [[Filiki Eteria]], a Greek [[freemasonry]]-style society that was to play an important role in the [[Greek war of independence|Greek War of Independence]], was founded in Odesa in 1814 before relocating to [[Constantinople]] in 1818. Odesa's [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] nature was documented by the great [[List of Russian language poets|Russian poet]] [[Alexander Pushkin]], who lived in [[exile|internal exile]] in Odesa between 1823 and 1824. In his letters, he wrote that Odesa was a city where "the air is filled with all Europe, French is spoken and there are European papers and magazines to read".

Odesa's growth was interrupted by the [[Crimean War]] of 1853–1856, during which it was bombarded by [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and [[Second French Empire|Imperial French]] naval forces.<ref>Clive Pointing, ''The Crimean War: The Truth Behind the Myth'', Chatto & Windus, London, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7011-7390-4}}.</ref> It soon recovered and the growth in trade made Odesa Russia's largest grain-exporting port. In 1866, the city was linked by rail with [[Kyiv]] and [[Kharkiv]] as well as with [[Iaşi]] in Romania.

The [[History of the Jews in Odesa|city became the home of a large Jewish community]] during the 19th century, and by 1897 Jews were estimated to comprise some 37% of the population.

In 1905, Odesa was the site of a workers' uprising supported by the crew of the [[Russian battleship Potemkin|Russian battleship ''Potemkin'']] and the [[Iskra#History|Menshevik]]'s [[Iskra]]. [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s famous motion picture ''The Battleship Potemkin'' commemorated the uprising and included a scene where hundreds of Odesan citizens were murdered on the great stone staircase (now popularly known as the "Potemkin Steps"), in one of the most famous scenes in motion picture history. At the top of the steps, which lead down to the port, stands a statue of the [[Armand-Emmanuel de Vignerot du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu|Duc de Richelieu]].<ref name=UkrainianWeekOd16042018/>

The actual massacre took place in streets nearby, not on the steps themselves, but the film caused many to visit Odesa to see the site of the "slaughter". The "Odesa Steps" continue to be a [[tourist attraction]] in Odesa.

Following the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]] in 1917 during [[Ukrainian-Soviet War]], Odesa saw two Bolshevik armed insurgencies, the [[Odessa Bolshevik Uprising|second of which]] succeeded in establishing their control over the city; for the following months, the city became a center of the [[Odesa Soviet Republic]]. After signing of the [[Brest-Litovsk Treaty]] all Bolshevik forces were driven out by 13 March 1918 by the combined armed forces of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], providing support to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].<ref name=UkrainianWeekOd16042018>{{citation | last = Tynchenko | first = Yaros | title = The Ukrainian Navy and the Crimean Issue in 1917-18 | url = http://ukrainianweek.com/History/105648 | work = [[The Ukrainian Week]] | date = 23 March 2018 | access-date = 14 October 2018 | archive-date = 11 November 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191111180649/https://ukrainianweek.com/History/105648 | url-status = live }}</ref>

With the end of the [[World War I]] and the withdrawal of armies of Central Powers, the Soviet forces fought for control over the country with the army of the Ukrainian People's Republic. A few months later the city was occupied by the [[French Army]] and the [[Greek Army]] that supported the Russian [[White movement|White Army]] in its struggle with the Bolsheviks. The Ukrainian general [[Nykyfor Hryhoriv]] who sided with Bolsheviks managed to drive the [[Triple Entente]] forces out of the city, but Odesa was soon retaken by the Russian White Army. By 1920 the Soviet Red Army managed to overpower both the Ukrainian and Russian White Army and secure the city.

The people of Odesa suffered badly from a [[famine]] that resulted from the [[Russian Civil War]] in 1921–1922 due to the Soviet policies of [[prodrazverstka]]. In 1937, around 1,000 Poles were executed in Odesa during the [[Polish Operation of the NKVD]].<ref>{{cite book|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Deportacje ludności polskiej do Kazachstanu w 1936 roku.

=== World War II ===

[[File:Odessa Soviet artilery.JPG|right|thumb|A Soviet gun crew in action at Odesa in 1941]]

During [[World War II]], Odesa was attacked by Romanian and German troops in August 1941. The [[Siege of Odessa (1941)|defense of Odesa]] started on 5 August 1941 and lasted for 73 days. The defense was organized on three lines with emplacements consisting of trenches, anti-tank ditches and pillboxes. The first line was {{convert|80|km|abbr=off}} long and situated some {{convert|25|to|30|km|abbr=off}} from the city. The second and main line of defense was situated {{convert|6|to|8|km|abbr=off}} from the city and was about {{convert|30|km|abbr=off}} long. The third and last line of defense was organized inside the city itself. [[Lyudmila Pavlichenko]], the famous female sniper, took part in the battle for Odesa. She recorded 187 confirmed kills during the defense of Odesa. Pavlichenko's confirmed kills during World War II totaled 309 (including 36 enemy snipers).

The city fell to the [[Axis powers|Axis]] on 16 October 1941,{{Sfn|Mykhailutsa|Niculcea|2020|pp=197–198}} and it was henceforth subject to Romanian administration. By that time, the Soviet authorities had been able to evacuate 200,000 people as well as weaponry and industrial equipment.{{Sfn|Mykhailutsa|Niculcea|2020|p=192;198}} A day later, Odesa was made the capital of [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]].<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Güney-Doğu Avrupa Araştırmaları Dergisi - the Journal of Southeastern European Studies|volume=35|year=2020|doi=10.26650/gaad.794916|title=The Southern Bug - Dnister Interfluve During World War II: Administrative Organization, Staffing and Statistics|first1=Mykola|last1=Mykhailutsa|first2=Igor|last2=Niculcea|issue=35|page=195|s2cid=243955109|url=https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/1290366|access-date=22 March 2022|archive-date=21 May 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220521210724/https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/1290366|url-status=live|doi-access=free}}</ref> Partisan fighting continued, however, in the [[Odesa catacombs|city's catacombs]].

Following the siege, and the Axis occupation, approximately 25,000 Odesans were murdered in the outskirts of the city and over 35,000 deported; this came to be known as the [[1941 Odessa massacre|Odesa massacre]]. Most of the atrocities were committed during the first six months of the occupation which officially began on 17 October 1941, when 80% of the 210,000 Jews in the region were killed,<ref name="Richardson, p.33">[[#Richardson|Richardson]], p. 33.</ref> compared to Jews in Romania proper where the majority survived.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/05/the-antonescu-paradox-romania-world-war-ii-hitler/|title=The Antonescu Paradox|date=5 February 2016|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=19 June 2018|archive-date=6 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206082954/https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/05/the-antonescu-paradox-romania-world-war-ii-hitler/|url-status=live}}</ref> After the Nazi forces began to lose ground on the Eastern Front, the Romanian administration changed its policy, refusing to deport the remaining [[Jewish population]] to extermination camps in German [[History of Poland (1939–1945)|occupied Poland]], and allowing Jews to work as hired labourers. As a result, despite the events of 1941, the survival of the Jewish population in this area was higher than in other areas of occupied eastern Europe.<ref name="Richardson, p.33"/>

[[Orders, decorations, and medals of the Soviet Union|A Soviet medal]], [[Medal "For the Defence of Odessa"|"For the Defence of Odesa"]], was established on 22 December 1942. It was one of the first four Soviet cities to be awarded the title of "[[Hero City (Soviet Union)|Hero City]]" in 1945. (The others were [[Siege of Leningrad|Leningrad]], [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], and [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941–42)|Sevastopol]]).

The city suffered severe damage and sustained many casualties over the course of the war. Many parts of Odesa were damaged during both its siege [[Odessa Offensive|and recapture on 10 April 1944]], when the city was finally liberated by the [[Red Army]]. Some of the Odesans had a more favourable view of the Romanian occupation, in contrast with the Soviet official view that the period was exclusively a time of hardship, deprivation, oppression and suffering – claims embodied in public monuments and disseminated through the media to this day.<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], p. 103.</ref> Subsequent Soviet policies imprisoned and executed numerous Odesans (and deported most of the German population) on account of collaboration with the occupiers.<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], p. 17.</ref>

During the 1960s and 1970s, the city grew. Nevertheless, the majority of Odesa's Jews emigrated to [[Israel]], the United States and other Western countries between the 1970s and 1990s.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}} Many ended up in the [[Brooklyn]] neighborhood of [[Brighton Beach]], sometimes known as "Little Odesa". Domestic migration of the Odesan middle and [[Social class|upper classes]] to Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], cities that offered even greater opportunities for career advancement, also occurred on a large scale. Despite this, the city grew rapidly by filling the void of those left with new migrants from rural Ukraine and industrial professionals invited from all over the Soviet Union.

[[File:Russov House Odessa2020.png|thumb|The city is currently undergoing a phase of widespread urban restoration: Russov House in 2020.]]
As a part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the city preserved and somewhat reinforced its unique cosmopolitan mix of Russian/Ukrainian/Jewish culture and a predominantly [[Russophone]] environment with the [[Odesan Russian|uniquely accented dialect of Russian spoken in the city]]. The city's unique identity has been formed largely thanks to its varied demography; all the city's communities have influenced aspects of Odesan life in some way or form.

=== Independence of Ukraine ===
In the [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum]] 85.38% of Odesa Oblast voted for independence.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ukrainian Independence Referendum |date=28 September 2015 |url=https://soviethistory.msu.edu/1991-2/the-end-of-the-soviet-union/the-end-of-the-soviet-union-texts/ukrainian-independence-declaration/ |access-date=20 November 2022 |archive-date=14 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220414065531/https://soviethistory.msu.edu/1991-2/the-end-of-the-soviet-union/the-end-of-the-soviet-union-texts/ukrainian-independence-declaration/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Odesa is a city of more than 1 million people. The city's industries include shipbuilding, [[oil refinery|oil refining]], chemicals, metalworking, and food processing. Odesa is also a Ukrainian [[Ukrainian Navy|naval]] base and home to a [[fishing fleet]]. It is known for its large outdoor market – the [[Seventh-Kilometer Market]], the largest of its kind in Europe.

Odesa was a contender for hosting [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] football matches in, but lost the competition to other cities in Ukraine.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Дніпропетровськ і Одеса втратили ЧЄ, бо не виконали взяті зобов'язання |url=https://www.unian.ua/euro2012/222978-dnipropetrovsk-i-odesa-vtratili-che-bo-ne-vikonali-vzyati-zobovyazannya.html |access-date=31 March 2022 |website=www.unian.ua |language=uk |archive-date=31 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220331214319/https://www.unian.ua/euro2012/222978-dnipropetrovsk-i-odesa-vtratili-che-bo-ne-vikonali-vzyati-zobovyazannya.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
[[File:Воронцовський маяк.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Vorontsov Lighthouse]] in the Gulf of Odesa. The city is located on the Black Sea.]]
Odesa is located ({{Coord|46|28|N|30|44|E|type:city(1,012,500)_region:UA}}) in the [[Black Sea Lowland]] in [[Southern Ukraine]] which being part of the greater [[Eastern European Plain]] gradually slopes towards the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Sea of Azov]]. The city lies on the northwestern coast of the [[Black Sea]] along the southwestern shore of the [[Gulf of Odesa]], approximately {{convert|31|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the estuary of the [[Dniester]] river and some {{convert|443|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the Ukrainian capital [[Kyiv]]. The international border between Ukraine and the [[Republic of Moldova]] lies some {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of the city.

The city is situated on terraced hills overlooking a small harbor. The average elevation at which the city is located is around {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The maximum is {{convert|65|m|ft|abbr=off}} and minimum (on the coast) amounts to {{convert|4.2|m|1|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. There are three large [[estuary|estuaries]] near the city: [[Kuialnyk Estuary|Kuialnyk]], [[Khadzhibey Estuary|Khadzhibey]] and [[Sukhyi Estuary|Sukhyi]].

The city currently covers a territory of {{convert|162.42|km²|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="zakon.rada.gov.ua">{{cite web|url=https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/3064-iii?lang=en|language=uk|website=zakon.rada.gov.ua|title=About change area of Odesa city|access-date=22 April 2020|archive-date=23 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723123133/https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/3064-iii?lang=en|url-status=live}}</ref> The population density for which is around 6,139 persons/km<sup>2</sup>. Sources of running water in the city include the Dniester River, from which water is taken and then purified at a processing plant just outside the city. Being located in the south of Ukraine, the topography of the area surrounding the city is typically flat and there are no large mountains or hills for many kilometres around. Flora is of the deciduous variety and Odesa is known for its tree-lined avenues which, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, made the city a favourite year-round retreat for the Russian aristocracy.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The city's location on the coast of the [[Black Sea]] has also helped to create a booming tourist industry in Odesa.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} The city's Arkadia beach has long been a favourite place for relaxation, both for the city's inhabitants and its visitors.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} This is a large sandy beach which is located to the south of the city centre. Odesa's many sandy beaches are considered to be quite unique in Ukraine,{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} as the country's southern coast (particularly in the Crimea) tends to be a location in which the formation of stoney and pebble beaches has proliferated.

The coastal cliffs adjacent to the city are home to frequent [[landslide]]s, resulting in a typical change of landscape along the Black Sea. Due to the fluctuating slopes of land, city planners are responsible for monitoring the stability of such areas, and for preserving potentially threatened building and other structures of the city [[above sea level]] near water.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Cherkez|first1=E.

=== Climate ===
Odesa has a hot-summer [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa'', using the {{convert|0|C|disp=sqbr}} isotherm), bordering a [[Cold semi-arid climate|cold semi-arid]] (''BSk'') as well as a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''). This has, over the past few centuries, aided the city greatly in creating conditions necessary for the development of summer [[tourism in Ukraine|tourism]]. During the tsarist era, Odesa's climate was considered to be beneficial for the body, and thus many wealthy but sickly persons were sent to the city in order to relax and recuperate. This resulted in the development of [[spa]] culture and the establishment of a number of [[luxury hotel]]s in the city. The average annual temperature of the sea is {{convert|13|-|14|C}}. Seasonal sea temperatures range from an average of {{convert|6|C}} from January to March, to {{convert|23|C}} in August. Typically, for a total of 4 months – from June to September – the average sea temperature in the Gulf of Odesa and the city's bay area exceeds {{convert|20|C}}.<ref name="weather2travel">{{cite web|url=http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/ukraine/odessa.php|title=Odessa Climate Guide|access-date=5 June 2009|archive-date=5 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005121556/http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/ukraine/odessa.php|url-status=live}}</ref>

The city typically experiences dry, cold winters which are relatively mild when compared to most of Ukraine, as they are marked by temperatures that rarely fall below {{convert|-10|C}}. Summers see an increased level of precipitation, and the city often experiences warm weather with temperatures often reaching the high 20s and low 30s °C. [[Snow]] cover is light to moderate due to the city's location on the northern coast of the Black Sea, and municipal services rarely experience problems that can often be found in other, more northern Ukrainian cities. The city hardly ever faces [[sea ice]] formation.

[[Odesa Oblast]] is also home to many different nationalities and minority [[ethnic group]]s, including [[Albanians]], [[Armenians]], [[Azeris]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Georgians]], [[Greeks]], [[Jews]], [[Polish people|Poles]], [[Romani people|Roma]], [[Romanians]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], among others.<ref name=Census2001/> Up until the early 1940s the city had a large Jewish population. As the result of [[Holocaust|mass deportation to extermination camps]] during the [[Second World War]], the city's Jewish population declined considerably. Since the 1970s, the majority of the remaining Jewish population [[Aliyah|emigrated to Israel]] and other countries, shrinking the Jewish community. Through most of the 19th century and until the mid-20th century, the largest ethnic group in Odesa was [[Russians]], with the second largest ethnic group being [[Jews]].<ref>Dnistryansky, М.S.

According to the Seventh Annual Ukrainian Municipal Survey, 96% of the residents of Odesa spoke some Russian at home and 29% spoke some Ukrainian at home (overlap due to a lot of people speaking both languages). [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] is gaining in popularity: in 2021, the share of residents speaking some Ukrainian at home has increased almost 5 times from 6% in 2015 to 29% in 2021.<ref name=iri2>{{cite journal|title=Seventh Ukrainian Municipal Survey, May 12–June 3, 2021|journal=IRI|url=https://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/seventh_municipal_survey_may_2021_eng_-_v2.pdf|access-date=11 November 2021|archive-date=28 January 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220128104615/https://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/seventh_municipal_survey_may_2021_eng_-_v2.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=iri1>{{cite journal|title=Ukrainian Municipal Survey, March 2–20, 2015|journal=IRI|url=http://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/2015-05-19_ukraine_national_municipal_survey_march_2-20_2015.pdf|access-date=27 May 2015|archive-date=28 January 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220128012638/https://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/2015-05-19_ukraine_national_municipal_survey_march_2-20_2015.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

Odesa is the [[Capital city|administrative centre]] of [[Odesa Raion]] and [[Odesa Oblast]], and it is the only constituent of [[Odesa urban hromada]], one of the [[hromada]]s of Ukraine.<ref name="admreform_2020_odesa">{{cite web |title=Одесская громада |url=https://gromada.info/ru/obschina/odesa/ |publisher=Портал об'єднаних громад України |language=ru |access-date=27 March 2023 |archive-date=27 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230327111242/https://gromada.info/ru/obschina/odesa/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city of Odesa is governed by a mayor and city council which work cooperatively to ensure the smooth-running of the city and procure its municipal bylaws. The city's budget is also controlled by the administration.

The mayoralty<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.odessa.ua/ua/mayor |title=Official Website of the city administration: Structure of the Mayorality |publisher=Odessa.ua |date=1 April 2008 |access-date=28 October 2011 |archive-date=19 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019092343/http://www.odessa.ua/ua/mayor/ |url-status=live }}</ref> plays the role of the executive in the city's municipal administration.

The territory of Odesa is divided into four administrative [[Urban districts of Ukraine|urban districts]] (raions):
* Kyivskyi District
* Khadzhybeiskyi District
* Prymorskyi District
* Peresypskyi District

In addition, every district has its own administration, subordinate to the Odesa [[City council]], and with limited responsibilities.

[[File:Opera2011.jpg|thumb|The [[Baroque architecture#Rome and Southern Italy|Italian baroque]] facade of the [[Odesa Opera and Ballet Theatre|Odesa Opera and Ballet Theater]]. It was started with the important contribution of the [[Italians of Odesa]]]]

Many of Odesa's buildings have, rather uniquely for a Ukrainian city, been influenced by the Mediterranean style of classical architecture. This is particularly noticeable in buildings built by architects such as the [[Italians of Odesa|Italian of Odesa]] [[Francesco Boffo]], who in the early 19th-century built a palace and colonnade for the Governor of Odesa, Prince Mikhail Vorontsov, the [[Odesa Fine Arts Museum|Potocki Palace]] and many other public buildings.

In 1887 one of the city's most well known architectural monuments was completed – the theatre, which still hosts a range of performances to this day; it is widely regarded as one of the world's finest opera houses. The first opera house was opened in 1810 and destroyed by fire in 1873. The modern building was constructed by [[Ferdinand Fellner|Fellner]] and [[Hermann Helmer|Helmer]] in [[Baroque Revival architecture|neo-baroque]]; its luxurious hall was built in the [[rococo]] style. It is said that thanks to its unique acoustics, even a whisper from the stage can be heard in any part of the hall. The theatre was projected along the lines of Dresden's [[Semperoper]] built in 1878, with its nontraditional foyer following the curvatures of the auditorium; the building's most recent renovation was completed in 2007.<ref>Buildings for Music, Michael Forsythe, Cambridge University Press, p. 344 {{ISBN|9780521268622}}</ref>

Odesa's most iconic symbol, the [[Potemkin Stairs]], is a vast staircase that conjures an illusion so that those at the top only see a series of large steps, while at the bottom all the steps appear to merge into one pyramid-shaped mass. The original 200 steps (now reduced to 192) were designed by Italian architect Francesco Boffo and built between 1837 and 1841. The steps were made famous by [[Sergei Eisenstein]] in his film, ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]''.

Most of the city's 19th-century houses were built of [[limestone]] mined nearby. Abandoned mines were later used and broadened by local [[smuggling|smugglers]]. This created a gigantic, complicated [[labyrinth]] of tunnels beneath Odesa, known as the [[Odesa catacombs]]. During World War II, the catacombs served as a hiding place for [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] and natural shelter for civilians, who were escaping airplane bombing.

[[Derybasivska Street]], an attractive pedestrian avenue named after [[José de Ribas]], the Neapolitan-born founder of Odesa and decorated Russian Navy Admiral from the Russo-Turkish War, is famous by its unique character and architecture.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} During the summer it is common to find large crowds of people leisurely sitting and talking on the outdoor terraces of numerous cafés, bars and restaurants, or simply enjoying a walk along the cobblestone street, which is not open to vehicular traffic and is kept shaded by the linden trees which line its route.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odessaapartments.dompavlov.com/content/deribasovskaya/ |access-date=26 December 2011 |url-status=dead |title=Deribasovskaya Street|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104105310/http://www.odessaapartments.dompavlov.com/content/deribasovskaya/ |archive-date=4 January 2012 }}</ref> A similar streetscape can also be found in that of Prymorsky Bulvar, a grand thoroughfare which runs along the edge of the plateau upon which the city is situated, and where many of the city's most imposing buildings are to be found.

As one of the biggest on the Black Sea, Odesa's port is busy all year round. The Odesa Seaport is located on an artificial stretch of the Black Sea coast, along with the north-western part of the Gulf of Odesa. The total shoreline length of Odesa's seaport is around {{convert|7.23|km|2|abbr=out}}. The port, which includes an oil refinery, container handling facility, passenger area and numerous areas for handling dry cargo, is lucky in that its work does not depend on seasonal weather; the harbour itself is defended from the elements by breakwaters. The port is able to handle up to 14 million tons of cargo and about 24 million tons of oil products annually, whilst its passenger terminals can cater for around 4 million passengers a year at full capacity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odessaapartments.dompavlov.com/content/odessa-passage/ |access-date=26 December 2011 |url-status=dead |title=The Passage|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104104712/http://www.odessaapartments.dompavlov.com/content/odessa-passage/ |archive-date=4 January 2012 }}</ref>

As Odesa has been inhabited by peoples of different religions, it has a variety of religious buildings, such as the Orthodox [[Transfiguration Cathedral in Odesa|Transfiguration Cathedral]], Catholic [[Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Cathedral, Odesa|Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Cathedral]], Lutheran St. Paul's Church, [[Brodsky Synagogue (Odesa)|Brodsky Synagogue]], and [[Al-Salam Mosque, Odesa|Al-Salam Mosque]]. There is also a number of historic cemeteries,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Головна |url=https://www.pomnim.od.ua/ |access-date=2024-04-01 |website=Місця скорботи Одеси}}</ref> including the Cossack [[Kuialnyk Cemetery]].

=== Parks and gardens ===
[[File:Primorskiy Parkway.jpg|thumb|right|A park at Prymorskiy prospekt in Odesa]]
There are a number of public parks and gardens in Odesa, among these are the Preobrazhensky, Gorky and Victory parks, the latter of which is an arboretum. The city is also home to a university botanical garden, which recently celebrated its 200th anniversary, and a number of other smaller gardens.

The [[Odesa city garden|City Garden]], or Gorodskoy Sad, is perhaps the most famous of Odesa's gardens. Laid out in 1803 by Felix De Ribas (brother of the founder of Odesa, José de Ribas) on a plot of urban land he owned, the garden is located right in the heart of the city. When Felix decided that he was no longer able to provide enough money for the garden's upkeep, he decided to present it to the people of Odesa in 1806.<ref>{{cite web |first=Oleg |last=Gubar |url=https://www.odessitclub.org/publications/almanac/alm_27/alm_27_28-45.pdf |title=How was the City Garden formed? |publisher=Odessitclub |date=2011 |access-date=29 December 2019 |archive-date=29 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191229191643/https://www.odessitclub.org/publications/almanac/alm_27/alm_27_28-45.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

The garden is home to a bandstand and is the traditional location for outdoor theater in the summertime. Numerous sculptures can also be found within the grounds, as well as a musical fountain, the waters of which are computer controlled to coordinate with the musical melody being played.

Odesa's largest park, [[Shevchenko Park (Odesa)|Shevchenko Park]] (previously Alexander Park), was founded in 1875, during a visit to the city by [[Alexander II of Russia|Emperor Alexander II]]. The park covers an area of around {{convert|700|by|900|m|ft|abbr=off}} and is located near the centre of the city, on the side closest to the sea. Within the park there are a variety of cultural and entertainment facilities, and wide pedestrian avenues.

In the center of the park is the local top-flight football team's [[Chornomorets Stadium]], the Alexander Column and municipal observatory. The Baryatinsky Bulvar is popular for its route, which starts at the park's gate before winding its way along the edge of the coastal plateau. There are a number of monuments and memorials in the park, one of which is dedicated to the park's namesake, the Ukrainian national poet [[Taras Shevchenko]].

== Education ==
[[File:Odesa National scientific library-03.jpg|thumb|The [[Odesa National Scientific Library]] is a major research library and the centre for studies in southern Ukraine.]]
Odesa is home to several universities and other institutions of higher education. The city's best-known and most prestigious university is the [[Odesa University|Odesa 'I.I. Mechnykov' National University]]. This university is the oldest in the city and was first founded by an edict of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] in 1865 as the Imperial [[Novorossiya Governorate|Novorossian]] University. Since then the university has developed to become one of modern Ukraine's leading research and teaching universities, with staff of around 1,800 and total of thirteen academic faculties. Other than the National University, the city is also home to the 1921-inaugurated [[Odesa National Economics University|Odesa National Economic University]], the [[Odesa National Medical University]] (founded 1900), the 1918-founded [[Odesa National Polytechnic University]].

In addition to these universities, the city is home to the [[National University Odesa Law Academy|National University "Odesa Law Academy"]], the National Academy of Telecommunications, the [[Odesa State Environmental University]] and the [[National University «Odesa Maritime Academy»|Odesa National Maritime Academy]]. The last of these institutions is a highly specialised and prestigious establishment for the preparation and training of merchant mariners which sees around 1,000 newly qualified officer cadets graduate each year and take up employment in the [[merchant marine]]s of numerous countries around the world. The South Ukrainian National Pedagogical University is also based in the city, this is one of the largest institutions for the preparation of educational specialists in Ukraine and is recognised as one of the country's finest of such universities.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}

In addition to all the state-run universities mentioned above, Odesa is also home to many private educational institutes and academies which offer highly specified courses in a range of different subjects.

With regard to primary and secondary education, Odesa has many schools catering for all ages from kindergarten through to lyceum (final secondary school level) age. Most of these schools are state-owned and operated, and all schools have to be state-accredited in order to teach children.

[[Jacob Pavlovich Adler|Jacob Adler]], the major star of the [[Yiddish theatre]] in New York and father of the actor, director and teacher [[Stella Adler]], was born and spent his youth in Odesa. The most popular Russian show business people from Odesa are [[Yakov Smirnoff]] (comedian), [[Mikhail Zhvanetsky]] (legendary [[List of humorists|humorist]] writer, who began his career as a port engineer) and [[Roman Kartsev]] (comedian). Zhvanetsky's and Kartsev's success in the 1970s, along with Odesa's [[KVN]] team, contributed to Odesa's established status as "capital of Soviet humor", culminating in the annual [[Humorina|Humoryna]] festival, carried out around the beginning of April.

Odesa was also the home of the late Armenian painter [[Sarkis Ordyan]] (1918–2003), the Ukrainian painter [[Mickola Vorokhta]] and the Greek philologist, author and promoter of [[Modern Greek|Demotic Greek]] [[Ioannis Psycharis]] (1854–1929).

[[File:Одеса 189115.JPG|thumb|The [[School of Stolyarsky]], founded in 1933, has long been recognised as a centre of musical excellence.]]
Poet [[Anna Akhmatova]] was born in Bolshoy Fontan near Odesa,<ref name="anderson">{{cite book|last= Anderson|first= Nancy K.|author2=Anna Andreevna Akhmatova|title= The word that causes death's defeat|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2004|isbn= 0-300-10377-8}}</ref> however her further work was not connected with the city and its literary tradition. Odesa has produced many writers, including [[Isaak Babel|Isaac Babel]], whose series of short stories, [[Odessa Tales]], are set in the city. Other Odesans are the duo [[Ilf and Petrov]]—authors of ''[[The Twelve Chairs]]'', and [[Yury Olesha|Yuri Olesha]], author of "[[The Three Fat Men]]". [[Vera Inber]], a poet and writer, as well as the poet and journalist [[Margarita Aliger]], were both born in Odesa. The Italian writer, Slavist and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] dissident [[Leone Ginzburg]] was born in Odesa into a Jewish family, and then went to Italy where he grew up and lived.

One of the most prominent pre-war [[Russian literature|Soviet writers]], [[Valentin Kataev]], was born here and began his writing career as early as high school (gymnasia). Before moving to Moscow in 1922, he made quite a few acquaintances here, including [[Yury Olesha]] and [[Ilf and Petrov|Ilya Ilf]] (Ilf's co-author Petrov was in fact Kataev's brother, Petrov being his pen-name). Kataev became a benefactor for these young authors, who would become some of the most talented and popular [[List of Russian language writers|Russian writers]] of this period. In 1955 Kataev became the first [[editing|chief editor]] of the ''Youth'' ({{langx|ru|link=no|Юность, Yunost'}}), one of the leading [[literary magazine|literature magazines]] of the [[Khrushchev Thaw|Ottepel]] of the 1950s and 1960s. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

These authors and comedians played a great role in establishing the "Odesa myth" in the Soviet Union. Odesans were and are viewed in the ethnic stereotype as sharp-witted, street-wise and eternally optimistic.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} These qualities are reflected in the "Odesa dialect", which borrows chiefly from the characteristic speech of the Odesan Jews, and is enriched by a plethora of influences common for the port city.<ref name="auto1">{{cite book|last=Tanny|first=Jarrod|title=City of Rogues and Schnorrers: Russia's Jews and the Myth of Old Odessa|year=2011|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-0-253-22328-9|pages=13–22, 142–156|url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=650630|access-date=12 February 2016|archive-date=4 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113836/http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=650630|url-status=live}}</ref>

The "Odesite speech" became a staple of the "Soviet Jew" depicted in a multitude of jokes and comedy acts, in which a Jewish adherent served as a wise and subtle dissenter and opportunist, always pursuing his own [[Quality of life|well-being]], but unwittingly pointing out the flaws and absurdities of the Soviet regime. The Odesan Jew in the jokes always "came out clean" and was, in the end, a lovable character – unlike some of other jocular nation stereotypes such as The Chukcha, The Ukrainian, The Estonian or The American.<ref name="auto1"/>

[[April Fools' Day]], held annually on 1 April, is one of the most celebrated festivals in the city. Practical joking is a central theme throughout, and Odesans dress in unique, colorful attire to express their spontaneous and comedic selves. The tradition has been celebrated since the early 1970s, when the humor of Ukraine's citizens were drawn to television and the media, further developing into a mass festival. Large amounts of money are made from the festivities, supporting Odesa's local entertainers and shops.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/world/europe/odessa-celebrates-april-fools-day.html|title=Odessa Celebrates April Fools' Day|last=Barry|first=Ellen|date=1 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=14 November 2016|archive-date=14 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114171159/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/world/europe/odessa-celebrates-april-fools-day.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The port of Odesa is one of the [[Ukrainian Navy]]'s most important bases on the [[Black Sea]]. Rail transport is an important sector of the economy in Odesa – largely due to the role it plays in delivering goods and imports to and from the city's port. The Container Terminal Odesa (CTO) in the port is the largest container terminal in Ukraine. It has been operated by the Hamburg-based HHLA Group since 2001 and, in addition to containers, also handles bulk goods, general cargo and project cargo. This means that Odesa is networked with the ports of [[Hamburg]], [[Muuga Harbour|Muuga]] and [[Trieste]] via the logistics group HHLA.<ref>Terminalbetreiber in Estland gekauft.

Odesa is linked to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, by the [[M05 highway (Ukraine)|M05 Highway]], a high quality multi-lane road which is set to be re-designated, after further reconstructive works, as an 'Avtomagistral' (motorway) in the near future. Other routes of national significance, passing through Odesa, include the M16 Highway to [[Moldova]], M15 to [[Izmail]] and [[Romania]], and the [[Highway M14 (Ukraine)|M14]] which runs from Odesa, through [[Mykolaiv]] and [[Kherson]] to Ukraine's eastern border with Russia. The M14 is of particular importance to Odesa's maritime and shipbuilding industries as it links the city with Ukraine's other large deep water port [[Mariupol]] which is located in the south east of the country.

Odesa also has a well-developed system of inter-urban municipal roads and minor beltways. However, the city is still lacking an extra-urban bypass for transit traffic which does not wish to proceed through the city centre.

Intercity bus services are available from Odesa to many cities in Russia (Moscow, [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Pyatigorsk]]), Germany (Berlin, Hamburg and [[Munich]]), Greece ([[Thessaloniki]] and [[Athens]]), [[Bulgaria]] ([[Varna, Bulgaria|Varna]] and [[Sofia]]) and several cities of [[Ukraine]] and Europe.

=== Railways ===
[[File:Будівля залізничного вокзалу 01.jpg|thumb|right|Odesa Holovna is one of Ukraine's largest railway terminals. Every day trains depart to many national and international destinations.]]

Odesa is served by a number of railway stations and halts, the largest of which is [[Odesa railway station|Odesa Holovna]] (Main Station). From this station services connect Odesa with [[Warsaw]], Prague, [[Bratislava]], Vienna, Berlin, Moscow, [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], the cities of Ukraine and many other cities of the former USSR. The city's first railway station was opened in the 1880s. During the Second World War, the iconic building of the main station, which had long been considered to be one of the [[Russian Empire]]'s premier stations, was destroyed through enemy action.

In 1952 the station was rebuilt to the designs of A Chuprina. The current station, which is characterised by its many [[Socialist Realism|socialist-realist]] architectural details and grand scale, was renovated by the state railway operator [[Ukrainian Railways]] in 2006.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}

=== Public transport ===
[[File:Tramways d'Odessa 1881.jpg|left|thumb|Share of the Belgian company "Tramways d'Odessa", issued 24 August 1881]]
[[File:Oděsa, Sofijska, tramvaj.jpg|thumb|An [[Trams in Odesa|Odesa tram]] on Sofievska Street]]

In 1881, Odesa became the first city in Imperial Russia to have steam tramway lines, an innovation that came only one year after the establishment of [[horsecar|horse tramway]] services in 1880 operated by the "Tramways d'Odessa", a Belgian owned company.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}} The first [[Narrow gauge railway|metre gauge]] steam tramway line ran from Railway Station to Great Fontaine and the second one to Hadzhi Bey Liman. These routes were both operated by the same Belgian company. Electric tramway started to operate on 22 August 1907. Trams were imported from Germany.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}

The city's [[public transport|public transit]] system is currently made up of trams,<ref name="trams">{{cite web|url=http://www.dgmaestro.com/tram|title=Odessa Tram Themes|access-date=2 May 2006|archive-date=11 March 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050311074800/http://www.dgmaestro.com/tram/|url-status=live}}</ref> [[trolleybus]]es, buses and fixed-route taxis ([[marshrutka]]s). Odesa also has a [[Aerial lift|cable car]] to [[Vidrada]] Beach,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cable car to beach "Otrada" - Odesa |url=http://wikimapia.org/6811754/Cable-car-to-beach-Otrada |access-date=21 February 2023 |website=wikimapia.org |language=en |archive-date=4 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104141617/http://wikimapia.org/6811754/Cable-car-to-beach-Otrada |url-status=live }}</ref> and recreational ferry service. There are two routes of public transport which connect Odesa Airport with the city center: trolley-bus No.14 and marshrutka No.117.<ref>[https://leodessa.com/odessa-public-transport/ Odessa tour guide] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003091810/https://leodessa.com/odessa-public-transport/ |date=3 October 2019 }}. leodessa.com</ref>

One additional mode of transport in Odesa is the [[Potemkin Stairs]] [[Odesa Funicular|funicular railway]], which runs between the city's Primorsky Bulvar and the sea terminal, has been in service since 1902. In 1998, after many years of neglect, the city decided to raise funds for a replacement track and cars. This project was delayed on multiple occasions but was finally completed eight years later in 2005.<ref>[http://www.odessaguide.net/sights_cablecar.en.html Odessa Sights] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104141624/http://www.odessaguide.net/sights_cablecar.en.html |date=4 November 2016 }}. odessaguide.net</ref> The [[funicular]] has now become as much a part of historic Odesa as the staircase to which it runs parallel.

=== Air transport ===
[[Odesa International Airport]], which is located to the south-west of the city centre, is served by a number of airlines. The airport is also often used by citizens of neighbouring countries for whom Odesa is the nearest large city and who can travel visa-free to Ukraine.

Transit flights from the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East to Odesa are offered by [[Ukraine International Airlines]] through their hub at Kyiv's [[Boryspil International Airport]].

[[File:Odessa Palace of Sports at Shevchenko Avenue (01).jpg|thumb|The Odesa Palace of Sports]]

The most popular sport in Odesa is [[Association football|football]]. The main professional football club in the city is [[FC Chornomorets Odesa]], who play in the [[Ukrainian Premier League]]. Chornomorets play their home games at the [[Chornomorets Stadium]], an elite-class stadium which has a maximum capacity of 34,164. The second football team in Odesa is [[FC Odesa]].[[File:Odesa Chornomorets Stadium 1.jpg|thumb|Chornomorets Stadium renovated in preparation to the [[Euro 2012]]]]Basketball is also a prominent sport in Odesa, with [[BC Odesa]] representing the city in the [[Ukrainian Basketball League]], the highest tier basketball league in Ukraine. Odesa will become one of five Ukrainian cities to host the [[FIBA EuroBasket 2015|39th European Basketball Championship]] in 2015.

=== Athletes ===
The cyclist and aviator [[Sergei Utochkin]] was one of the most famous natives of Odesa in the years before the Russian Revolution. [[Chess]] player [[Efim Geller]] was born in the city. Gymnast [[Tatiana Gutsu]] (known as "The Painted Bird of Odesa") brought home Ukraine's first Olympic gold medal as an independent nation when she outscored the USA's [[Shannon Miller]] in the women's all-around event at [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona, Spain.

Figure skaters [[Oksana Grishuk]] and [[Evgeny Platov]] won the 1994 and 1998 Olympic gold medals as well as the 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 World Championships in ice dance. Both were born and raised in the city, though they skated at first for the Soviet Union, in the Unified Team, the Commonwealth of Independent States, and then Russia. Hennadiy Avdyeyenko won a 1988 Olympic gold medal in thehigh jump, setting an Olympic record at {{convert|2.38|m|ft|2|abbr=off}}.
