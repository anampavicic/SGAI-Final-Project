'''Prato''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|r|ɑː|t|oʊ}} {{respell|PRAH|toh}}; {{IPA|it|ˈpraːto|lang|It-Prato.ogg}}) is a city and ''[[comune]]'' (municipality) in [[Tuscany]], Italy, and is the capital of the [[province of Prato]]. The city lies in the northeast of Tuscany, at an elevation of {{convert|65|m|ft}}, at the foot of [[Monte Retaia]] (the last peak in the Calvana chain). With 198,034 inhabitants {{As of|2024|January|1|lc=y}},<ref name="ISTAT"/> Prato is Tuscany's second largest city (after [[Florence]]) and the third largest in [[Central Italy]] (after [[Rome]] and Florence).

Historically, Prato's economy has been based on the textile industry and its district is the largest in Europe. The textile district of Prato is made up of about 7000 fashion companies, amounting to around 2 billion euros of city's export.<ref>{{cite web |title=Distretto Tessile |url=https://www.cittadiprato.it/IT/Sezioni/436/DISTRETTO-TESSILE/ |website=Città di Prato |language=it}}</ref> The renowned [[Datini archives]] are a significant collection of late medieval documents concerning economic and trade history, produced between 1363 and 1410.<ref>{{Cite web |title=THE DATINI's ARCHIVE |url=https://www.istitutodatini.it/schede/archivio/eng/arc-dat1.htm |access-date=2023-02-13 |website=Fondazione Istituto Internazionale di Storia Economica F. Datini}}</ref>

The city boasts important historical and artistic attractions, with a cultural span that started with the [[Etruscans]] and then expanded in the [[Middle Ages]] and reached its peak with the [[Renaissance]], when artists such as [[Donatello]], [[Filippo Lippi]] and [[Botticelli]] left their testimonies in the city.
The famous ''[[cantucci]]'', a type of [[biscotti]] invented in Prato during the Middle Ages, are still produced by local traditional bakers.

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Prato}}

=== Ancient times ===
{{unreferencedsect|date=July 2024}}
Archaeological findings have proved that Prato's surrounding hills were inhabited since [[Paleolithic]] times. The plain was later colonized by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]]. In 1997, remains of a previously unknown city from that civilization were discovered in the neighbourhood of [[Gonfienti (Prato)|Gonfienti]] near [[Campi Bisenzio]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bini |first=Maurizio |date=2007-02-02 |title=Gonfienti di Prato: la città etrusca |url=https://www.welcome2prato.com/2009/09/gonfienti-prato.html |access-date=2024-07-16 |website=Welcome 2 Prato |language=IT}}</ref> It was of medium size and it was already a centre for the [[wool]] and [[textile industry]]. According to some scholars, it could be the mythical [[Camars]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Centauro |first=Giuseppe Alberto |title=Ipotesi su Camars in Val di Marina. Dalla città etrusca sul Bisenzio all'identificazione di Clusio |publisher=Nuova Toscana Editrice |year=2004 |isbn=9788887263275 |location=Campi Bisenzio |language=IT}}</ref> The Etruscan city was inhabited until the 5th century BC, when, for undisclosed reasons, it decayed; control of the area later shifted to the [[ancient Rome|Romans]], who had their [[Via Cassia]] pass through here, but did not build any settlement.

=== Middle Ages ===
{{unreferencedsect|date=July 2024}}
In the early [[Middle Ages]], the [[Byzantine]] and [[Lombards|Lombard]] dominations prevailed in the region.

The history of Prato itself begins from the 10th century, when two distinct villages, Borgo al Cornio and ''Castrum Prati'' (Prato's Castle), are known.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=2007-02-02 |title=Storia di Prato dagli Etruschi fino ai giorni nostri |url=https://www.welcome2prato.com/2009/10/storia-citta-prato-toscana.html |access-date=2024-07-16 |website=Welcome 2 Prato}}</ref> In the following century the two settlements were united under the lords of the castle, the [[Alberti (surname)|Alberti]] family, who received the [[holy Roman Empire|imperial title]] of Counts of Prato.<ref name=":1" /> In the same period the plain was drained and a hydraulic system regulating and exploiting the waters of the [[Bisenzio River]] was created to feed the ''gualchiere'' (pre-industrial textile machines).

After a siege in 1107 by the troops of [[Matilde of Canossa]], the Alberti retreated to their family fortresses in the Bisenzio Valley: Prato could therefore develop as a [[medieval commune|free commune]]. Within two centuries it reached 15,000 inhabitants, spurred in by the flourishing textile industry and by the presence of the [[sacra Cintola|Holy Belt]] relic. Two new lines of walls had to be built in the mid-12th century, and in the early 14th century.

In 1313, in order to counter the expansionism of the [[Republic of Florence]], Prato submitted voluntarily under the seigniory of [[Robert of Anjou]], [[King of Naples]]. However, on 23 February 1351 [[Joanna I of Naples]] sold the city to the Republic of Florence in exchange for 17,500 [[Italian coin florin|golden florins]].<ref name=":1" />

Prato's history therefore followed that of Florence in the following centuries.

=== Modern age ===
In 1512, during the [[War of the League of Cambrai|War of the Holy League]], the city was sacked by Spanish troops assembled by [[Pope Julius II]] and the king of Aragón, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]], to recover the nearby city of [[Florence]] for the [[Medici family]].{{cn|date=July 2024}} The severity of the sack of Prato led to the surrender of the [[Florentine Republic]], and to the restoration of the Medici rule. Historians debate the actual number of people killed during the sack, but contemporary chroniclers asserted between 2000 and 6000 people were slaughtered in the streets.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

In 1653, Prato obtained the status of city and became seat of a Catholic diocese. During the 18th century, with the ascent of Lorraine at the head of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, the city was embellished and also experienced a significant cultural development, which was promoted by the grand dukes themselves.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

The intellectual foresight of Prato and its land in this century finds its maximum expression in the words of [[Filippo Mazzei]], a friend of [[Thomas Jefferson]], which today are reported in the second paragraph of the American [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]: ''[[All men are created equal]]''.<ref>{{cite news|first=Adri Barr|last=Crocetti|url=http://adribarrcrocetti.com/main/2012/07/03/philip-mazzei-and-the-declaration-of-independence/|title=Philip Mazzei and the Declaration of Independence|work=Adri Barr Crocetti|date=4 July 2012|access-date=8 September 2018}}</ref>

After the [[unification of Italy]] in the 19th century, Prato became a primary industrial centre, especially in the textile sector (Italian historian [[Emanuele Repetti]] described it as the "Italian [[Manchester]]"), and it population grew up to 50,000 in 1901 and to 180,000 in 2001.{{cn|date=July 2024}} The town experienced significant internal immigration. Previously part of the [[province of Florence]], in 1992 Prato became the capital of the [[province of Prato|eponymous province]].{{cn|date=July 2024}}

==Climate==
Prato has a [[humid subtropical climate]] which has sunny hot summers and cool damp winters. July is the driest month of the year.

[[File:Cantuccini-Toscani.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Cantucci]] di Prato]]
The typical Pratese cuisine, as in general that of the whole [[Tuscany]], uses "poor" products and ingredients, mainly from the territory.
The bread, called ''bozza pratese'', is definitely the basic element of the kitchen. In Prato, as in [[Florence]] it is customary to use bread to prepare croutons with the livers, panzanella and pappa al pomodoro.

The city of Prato is crossed by two railway lines: the Viareggio-Florence Railroad and the Bologna-Florence Railways. The first is a regional line that connects it with [[Florence]] and western Tuscany, while the second is part of the Milan-Naples ridge and is one of the most important Italian railway lines. Prato is therefore served by some long-distance trains.

There are three railway stations in the city:

* ''Prato Porta al Serraglio'' railway station is situated in the historical center of the town and connects to [[Florence Santa Maria Novella|Florence]] in about 25 minutes by the [[Viareggio–Florence railway]].
* [[Prato Centrale railway station]] was opened in 1862 and is the largest station in Prato. It is part of [[Bologna–Florence railway]] and [[Viareggio–Florence railway]].
* Prato Borgonuovo Station

=== Highways ===
* Motorway A11 (Firenze-Mare): Prato is served by A11 motorway through two toll stations: ''Prato Est'' and ''Prato Ovest''.
* Motorway A1 (Milano-Napoli): Prato is served by A1 motorway through one toll station: ''Calenzano''.

From the early nineties, the city is home to an important university center with over 2000 registered students{{cn|date=July 2024}}, called "University Campus of Prato", born from the collaboration between the [[University of Florence]] and a consortium company born from the collaboration between local authorities (first of all the Municipality of Prato) and various private subjects, the PIN Scrl, owner of the building (formerly the prestigious Istituto T. Buzzi and renovated for the occasion) which houses the polo. Some courses of study are underway at the faculty of [[economics]], letters and philosophy, engineering, medicine and [[surgery]] and [[political sciences]] of the Florentine university.
