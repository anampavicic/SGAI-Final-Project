Located in the [[Northern Pakistan|northwestern region]] of the country, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the fourth largest province of Pakistan by land area and the third-largest province by population. It is bordered by [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] to the south; [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Islamabad Capital Territory]], and [[Azad Kashmir]] to the east; and [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] to the north and northeast. It shares an [[Durand Line|international border]] with [[Afghanistan]] to the west. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has a varied geography of rugged [[mountain range]]s, valleys, rolling foothills, and dense agricultural farms.

While it is the third-largest Pakistani province in terms of both its population and [[Economy of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|its economy]], it is geographically the smallest.

Once a [[Gandharan Buddhism|stronghold of Buddhism]], Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the site of the ancient region of [[Gandhara]], including the ruins of the Gandharan capital of [[Pushkalavati]] (located near present day [[Charsadda]]). The region's history is characterized by frequent invasions by various empires, largely due to its geographical proximity to the historically important [[Khyber Pass]].<ref>Rafi U. Samad, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pNUwBYGYgxsC&pg=PA33 ''The Grandeur of Gandhara: The Ancient Buddhist Civilization of the Swat, Peshawar, Kabul, and Indus Valleys''].

Although it is colloquially known by a variety of other names, the name "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa" was brought into effect for the [[North-West Frontier Province]] in April 2010, following the passing of the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|18th Constitutional Amendment]]. On 24 May 2018, the [[National Assembly of Pakistan]] voted in favour of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|25th Constitutional Amendment]], which merged the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas|FATA]] as well as the [[Provincially Administered Tribal Areas]] into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.<ref>{{Cite web |title=NA approves merger of Fata, Pata with KP |url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/320943-na-approves-merger-of-fata-pata-with-kp |access-date=2023-05-09 |website=www.thenews.com.pk |language=en |archive-date=15 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211115144244/https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/320943-na-approves-merger-of-fata-pata-with-kp |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] subsequently approved the bill on 28 May 2018;<ref name=":0a">{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1410351|title=KP Assembly approves landmark bill merging Fata with province|last=Hayat|first=Arif|date=27 May 2018|work=Dawn.com|access-date=28 May 2018|language=en-US|archive-date=27 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180527130911/https://www.dawn.com/news/1410351|url-status=live}}</ref> it was signed into law on 31 May by erstwhile Pakistani president [[Mamnoon Hussain]], which officially completed the administrative merger process.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://nation.com.pk/01-Jun-2018/president-signs-fata-kp-merger-bill-into-law|title=President signs Fata-KP merger bill into law|date=1 June 2018|work=The Nation|access-date=15 June 2018|language=en-US|archive-date=8 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308201211/https://nation.com.pk/01-Jun-2018/president-signs-fata-kp-merger-bill-into-law|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.geo.tv/latest/197519-fata-official-merged-with-kp-as-president-mamnoon-signs|title=President signs amendment bill, merging FATA with KP|work=Geo News|access-date=15 June 2018|language=en-US|archive-date=15 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615190747/https://www.geo.tv/latest/197519-fata-official-merged-with-kp-as-president-mamnoon-signs|url-status=live}}</ref>

When the British established it as a province, they called it "North West Frontier Province" (abbreviated as NWFP) until 2010 due to its relative location being in the northwest of the [[British Indian Empire]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morrison|first1=Cameron|title=A New Geography of the Indian Empire and Ceylon|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.56267|date=1909|publisher=T.Nelson and Sons|page=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.56267/page/n180 176]}}</ref> After the creation of Pakistan, Pakistan continued with this name but a Pashtun political party, [[Awami National Party]] based in the province demanded that the province name be changed to "Pakhtunkhwa".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ayers|first1=Alyssa|title=Speaking Like a State: Language and Nationalism in Pakistan|date=23 July 2009|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=61|isbn=978-0521519311}}</ref> Their logic behind that demand was that [[Punjabi people]], [[Sindhi people]] and [[Baloch people]] have their provinces named after their ethnicities but that is not the case for [[Pashtun people]].<ref name=Pakhtunkhwadotcom>{{cite web|url=http://pakhtunkhwa.com/html/body_nwfp_in_search_of_a_name.html|title=NWFP in search of a name|work=pakhtunkhwa.com|access-date=24 January 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131042427/http://pakhtunkhwa.com/html/body_nwfp_in_search_of_a_name.html|archive-date=31 January 2016}}</ref>

[[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]], the largest opposition party at the time was ready to change the province's name by supporting the ruling [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] and ANP, in a constitutional amendment but wanted to name the province something other than which does not carry only the Pashtun identity in it as they argued that there were other minor communities living in the province especially the [[Hazarewals]] of the [[Hazara region]] who spoke [[Hindko]] thus the word ''Khyber'' was introduced with the name because it is the name of a major [[Khyber Pass|pass]] which connects Pakistan to Afghanistan.<ref name=Pakhtunkhwadotcom/>

===North-West Frontier Province===
For over a hundred years after its founding as a province of [[British Raj]] in 1901, it was known as the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North-West Frontier Province]] (abbreviated as NWFP) until 2010 due to its relative location being in the northwest of the nation.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morrison |first1=Cameron |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.56267 |title=A New Geography of the Indian Empire and Ceylon |date=1909 |publisher=T.Nelson and Sons |page=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.56267/page/n180 176]}}</ref> Unofficially, it was known as '''Sarhad''' ({{langx|ur|{{Nastaliq|سرحد}}}}), derived from the province's Urdu name given to it by the Mughals, which means "frontier".

===Efforts to change the name===
For most of the history of the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), there were efforts to change its name. The name ''Afghania'' was proposed first by the founding leaders of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] in 1933 and was at least partly chosen to represent the first "a" in "P'''a'''kistan". The need for a change was explained by the man who named Pakistan in his "[[Pakistan Declaration|Now or Never]]" pamphlet, [[Choudhary Rahmat Ali]] Khan, as:

{{Blockquote| "North-West Frontier Province" is semantically non-descript and socially wrongful. It is non-descript because it merely indicates their geographical situation as a province of old "British India" [which no longer exists]. It is wrongful because it suppresses the social entity of these people. In fact, it suppresses that entity so completely that when composing the name "Pakistan" for our homelands, I had to call the North-West Frontier Province the Afghan Province.<ref>Choudhary Rahmat Ali, 1947, ''Pakistan: The Fatherland of the Pak Nation'', Cambridge, {{OCLC|12241695}}</ref>}}

Suggestions for new names came and went. Although [[#Other names|some of the names]] were ethnically neutral, most proposals emphasised the province's Pashtun ethnic identity. The renaming issue was an emotional one which often crossed party lines and not all supporters of a renaming agreed on the name Pakhtunkhwa.

====20th-century efforts====
By the late 20th century, President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] agreed with [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] to change the name to ''Pashtunistan'' but he contended that the term Pashtunistan had become controversial and was being politicized by Afghanistan.

===Khyber Pakhtunkhwa===
The [[Pashtun nationalism|Pashtun nationalist]] [[Awami National Party]] based in the province demanded that the province name be changed to "Pakhtunkhwa".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ayers |first1=Alyssa |title=Speaking Like a State: Language and Nationalism in Pakistan |date=23 July 2009 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521519311 |page=61}}</ref> Their logic behind that demand was that [[Punjabi people]], [[Sindhi people]] and [[Baloch people]] have their provinces named after their ethnicities but that is not the case for [[Pashtun people]].<ref name=Pakhtunkhwadotcom/>

[[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]], the largest opposition party at the time was ready to change the province's name by supporting the ruling [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] and ANP, in a constitutional amendment but wanted to name the province something other than which does not carry only the Pashtun identity in it as they argued that there were other minor communities living in the province especially the [[Hazarewals]] of the [[Hazara region]] who spoke [[Hindko]] thus the word ''Khyber'' was introduced with the name because it is the name of a major [[Khyber Pass|pass]] which connects Pakistan to Afghanistan.<ref name=Pakhtunkhwadotcom/>

In early 2010, the process of renaming proceeded and the [[Pakistani Senate]] confirmed the name change to ''Khyber Pakhtunkhwa'' in the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|18th amendment]] to the [[Constitution of Pakistan]] with a unanimous 90 votes on 15 April 2010.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |date=15 April 2010 |title=NWFP officially renamed as Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa |url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/07-senate-begins-voting-on-18th-amendment-ha-02 |access-date=15 April 2010 |publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn.com]]}}</ref>

{{Main|History of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa}}

=== Early history ===
During the times of [[Indus Valley civilisation]] (3300 BCE – 1700 BCE) the Khyber Pass through [[Hindu Kush]] provided a route to other neighbouring empires and was used by merchants on trade excursions.<ref>{{Harv|Princeton Roadmap to Regents|p=80}}</ref> From 1500 BCE, [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian peoples]] started to enter in the region from [[Central Asia]] after having passed the Khyber Pass.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mohiuddin |first=Yasmeen |title=Pakistan: A Global Studies Handbook |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2007 |isbn=9781851098019 |page=36}}</ref><ref name="humshehri.org"/>

===Alexander's conquests===
In the spring of 327 BC [[Alexander the Great]] crossed the Hindu Kush and advanced to [[Nicaea (Punjab)|Nicaea]], where Omphis, king of [[Taxila Tehsil|Taxila]] and other chiefs joined him. Alexander then dispatched part of his force through the valley of the Kabul River, while he himself advanced into Bajaur and Swat with his light troops.<ref name="IG148">{{Harv|Imperial Gazetteer|p=148}}</ref> [[Craterus]] was ordered to fortify and repopulate [[Arigaion]], probably in Bajaur, which its inhabitants had burnt and deserted. Having defeated the Aspasians, from whom he took 40,000 prisoners and 230,000 oxen, Alexander crossed the [[Gouraios]] ([[Panjkora]]) and entered the territory of the [[Assakenoi]] and laid siege to Massaga, which he took by storm. Ora and Bazira (possibly Bazar) soon fell. The people of Bazira fled to the rock Aornos, but Alexander made Embolima (possibly [[Amb State|Amb]]) his base, and attacked the rock from there, which was captured after a desperate resistance. Meanwhile, [[Peukelaotis]] (in [[Hashtnagar]], {{convert|17|mi|km}} north-west of [[Peshawar]]) had submitted, and Nicanor, a Macedonian, was appointed satrap of the country west of the Indus.<ref name= IG149>{{Harv|Imperial Gazetteer|p=149}}</ref>

===Mauryan rule===
[[File:Shiva and Parvati BM OA1939.01-19.17.jpg|thumb|left|An ancient statue of [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]] found in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.]]

Mauryan rule began with [[Chandragupta Maurya]] displacing the [[Nanda Empire]], establishing the Mauryan Empire. A while after, Alexander's general Seleucus had attempted to once again invade the subcontinent from the Khyber pass hoping to take lands that Alexander had conquered, but never fully absorbed into this empire. Seleucus was defeated and the lands of Aria, Arachosia, Gandhara, and Gedrosia were ceded to the Mauryans in exchange for a matrimonial alliance and 500 elephants. With the defeat of the Greeks, the land was once more under Hindu rule.<ref>{{Harv|Faber and Faber|pp=52–53}}</ref> Chandragupta's son [[Bindusara]] further expanded the empire. However, it was Chandragupta's grandson [[Ashoka]], who converted to [[Buddhism]] and made it the official state religion in [[Gandhara]] and also [[Pakhli]], the modern Hazara, as evidenced by rock-inscriptions at [[Shahbazgarhi]] and [[Mansehra]].<ref name= IG149/>

After Ashoka's death the [[Mauryan]] empire fell to pieces, just as in the west the [[Seleucid]] power was waning.

The Indo-Greek king [[Menander I]] (reigned 155–130 BCE) drove the Greco-Bactrians out of [[Gandhara]] and beyond the [[Hindu Kush]], becoming king shortly after his victory.

His empire survived him in a fragmented manner until the last independent Greek king, [[Strato II]], disappeared around 10 CE. Around 125 BCE, the Greco-Bactrian king [[Heliocles]], son of Eucratides, fled from the [[Yuezhi]] invasion of Bactria and relocated to Gandhara, pushing the Indo-Greeks east of the [[Jhelum River]]. The last known Indo-Greek ruler was [[Theodamas]], from the [[Bajaur]] area of Gandhara, mentioned on a 1st-century CE signet ring, bearing the Kharoṣṭhī inscription ''"Su Theodamasa"'' (''"Su"'' was the Greek transliteration of the [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]] royal title ''"Shau"'' ("[[Shah]]" or "King")).

It is during this period that the fusion of Hellenistic and South Asian mythological, artistic and religious elements becomes most apparent, especially in the region of Gandhara.{{Citation needed|date=November 2023}}

Local Greek rulers still exercised a feeble and precarious power along the borderland, but the last vestige of the Greco-Indian rulers were finished by a people known to the old Chinese as the Yeuh-Chi.<ref name="IG149" />

=== Indo-Scythian Kingdom ===
[[File:Buner reliefs Scythian bacchanalian cropped.jpg|left|thumb|One of the [[Buner reliefs]] showing Scythian soldiers dancing. [[Cleveland Museum of Art]].]]

The [[Indo-Scythians]] were descended from the [[Sakas]] (Scythians) who migrated from Central Asia into South Asia from the middle of the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century BCE. They displaced the Indo-Greeks and ruled a kingdom that stretched from Gandhara to [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]]. The first Indo-Scythian king [[Maues]] established [[Saka]] hegemony by conquering [[Indo-Greek]] territories.<ref>The Grandeur of Gandhara, Rafi-us Samad, Algora Publishing, 2011, p.64-67 [https://books.google.com/books?id=PMEd8Cqh-YQC&pg=PA66]</ref> The power of the Saka rulers declined after the defeat to [[Chandragupta II]] of the [[Gupta Empire]] in the 4th century.<ref>Ancient India by Ramesh Chandra Majumdar p. 234</ref>

=== Indo-Parthian Kingdom ===
[[File:Takht-e-bahi.jpg|thumb|Ancient [[Buddhist]] [[monastery]] [[Takht-i-Bahi]] (a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]) constructed by the Indo-Parthians.]]

The [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom]] was ruled by the Gondopharid dynasty, named after its first ruler [[Gondophares]]. For most of their history, the leading Gondopharid kings held [[Taxila]] (in the present [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] province of [[Pakistan]]) as their residence, but during their last few years of existence the capital shifted between [[Kabul]] and [[Peshawar]]. These kings have traditionally been referred to as Indo-Parthians, as their coinage was often inspired by the [[Arsacid dynasty of Parthia|Arsacid]] dynasty, but they probably belonged to a wider groups of [[Iranian peoples|Iranic]] tribes who lived east of [[Parthia]] proper, and there is no evidence that all the kings who assumed the title ''Gondophares'', which means "Holder of Glory", were even related.

===Kushan Empire===
[[File:KanishkaCasket.JPG|left|thumb|225x225px|[[Peshawar]]'s [[Kanishka stupa]] once kept sacred [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] relics in the [[Kanishka casket]].]]

The [[Yuezhi]] nomads had driven the [[Sakas]] from the highlands of [[Central Asia]], and were themselves forced southwards by the nomadic [[Xiongnu]]. One group, known as the Kushan, took the lead, and its chief, [[Kujula Kadphises|Kadphises I]], seized vast territories extending south to the [[Kabul]] valley. His son Kadphises II conquered North-Western India, which he governed through his generals.

Jayapala was succeeded by his son [[Anandapala]],<ref name="Lewis2" /> who along with other succeeding generations of the Shahiya dynasty took part in various unsuccessful campaigns against the advancing Ghaznvids but were unsuccessful. The Hindu rulers eventually exiled themselves to the [[Kashmir]] [[Siwalik]] Hills.<ref name="Ferishta" />

===Ghaznavids===
After the battle of Peshawar, Mahmud of Ghazni had secured controlled over southern regions of Pakhtunkhwa. He also (1024 and 1025) raided the [[Pashtuns]].<ref name=IG150/>  {{sfn|Wynbrandt|2009|pp=52–55}} His descendants reigned till 1179, when [[Muhammad of Ghor]] took Peshawar, making it part of his expanding [[Ghurid Empire]].

===Delhi sultanate===
Following the invasion by the Ghurids, five unrelated heterogeneous dynasties ruled over the Delhi Sultanate sequentially: the [[Mamluk dynasty (Delhi)|Mamluk dynasty]] (1206–1290), the [[Khalji dynasty]] (1290–1320), the [[Tughlaq dynasty]] (1320–1414), the [[Sayyid dynasty]] (1414–1451), and the [[Lodi dynasty]] (1451–1526).<ref name="sen2">{{cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |pages=68–102}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the [[Pashtuns]] now appeared as a political factor. At the close of the fourteenth century they were firmly established in their present-day demographics south of Kohat, and in 1451 Bahlol Lodi's accession to the throne of Delhi gave them a dominant position in [[Northern India]]. [[Yusufzai]] tribes from the Kabul and Jalalabad valleys began migrating to the [[Valley of Peshawar]] beginning in the 15th century,<ref name="bosworth"/> and displaced the [[Swati (Pashtun tribe)|Swatis]] of the [[Bhittani]] confederation and [[Dilazak]] Pashtun tribes across the [[Indus River]] to [[Hazara Division]].<ref name="bosworth" />

Mughal suzerainty over the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region was partially established after Babar, the founder of the Mughal Empire, invaded the region in 1505 CE via the [[Khyber Pass]].

===Sikh Empire===
[[Ranjit Singh]] invaded Peshawar in 1818 and captured it from the Durrani Empire. The [[Sikh Empire]] based in Lahore did not immediately secure direct control of the Peshawar region, but rather paid nominal [[tribute]] to Jehandad Khan of Khattak, who was nominated by Ranjit Singh to be ruler of the region.

After Ranjit Singh's departure from the region, Khattak's rule was undermined and power seized by Yar Muhammad Khan. In 1823, Ranjit Singh returned to capture Peshawar, and was met by the armies of [[Azim Khan]] at [[Nowshera, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Nowshera]]. Following the Sikh victory at the [[Battle of Nowshera]], Ranjit Singh re-captured Peshawar. Rather than re-appointing Jehandad Khan of Khattak, Ranjit Singh selected Yar Muhammad Khan to once again rule the region.

The Sikh Empire annexed the lower parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region following advances from the armies of [[Hari Singh Nalwa]]. An 1835 attempt by [[Dost Mohammad Khan|Dost Muhammad Khan]] to re-occupy Peshawar failed when his army declined to engage in combat with the [[Dal Khalsa (Sikh Empire)|Dal Khalsa]]. Dost Muhammad Khan's son, [[Wazir Akbar Khan|Mohammad Akbar Khan]] engaged with Sikh forces the [[Battle of Jamrud]] of 1837, in which prominent sikh commander Hari Singh was killed.

During Sikh rule, an Italian named [[Paolo Avitabile]] was appointed an administrator of Peshawar in 1838, and is remembered for having unleashed a reign of fear there. The city's famous Mahabat Khan, built in 1630 in the Jeweller's Bazaar, was badly damaged and desecrated by the Sikhs, who also rebuilt the Bala Hissar fort during their occupation of Peshawar.

=== British Raj ===

[[British East India Company]] defeated the Sikhs during the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] in 1849, and incorporated small parts of the region into the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Province of Punjab]]. While Peshawar was the site of a small revolt against British during the [[Mutiny of 1857]], local Pashtun tribes throughout the region generally remained neutral or supportive of the British as they detested the Sikhs,<ref name="humshehri.org">{{cite web |title=KP Historical Overview |url=http://humshehri.org/history/kpk-historical-overview/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311194150/http://humshehri.org/history/kpk-historical-overview/ |archive-date=11 March 2015 |access-date=22 April 2015 |work=Humshehri}}</ref> in contrast to other parts of [[British India]] which rose up in revolt against the British. However, British control of parts of the region was routinely challenged by [[Wazir (Pashtun tribe)|Wazir]] tribesmen in [[Waziristan]] and other Pashtun tribes, who resisted any foreign occupation until Pakistan was created. By the late 19th century, the official boundaries of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region still had not been defined as the region was still claimed by the Kingdom of Afghanistan. It was only in 1893 The British demarcated the [[Durand Line|boundary with Afghanistan]] under a treaty agreed to by the Afghan king, [[Abdur Rahman Khan]], following the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]].<ref name="LoC">{{cite web |date=August 2008 |title=Country Profile: Afghanistan |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408085103/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf |archive-date=8 April 2014 |access-date=30 January 2014 |publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]]}}</ref> Several princely states within the boundaries of the region were allowed to maintain their autonomy under the terms of maintaining friendly ties with the British. As the British war effort during [[World War One]] demanded the reallocation of resources from British India to the European war fronts, some tribesmen from Afghanistan crossed the Durand Line in 1917 to attack British posts in an attempt to gain territory and weaken the legitimacy of the border. The validity of the Durand Line, however, was re-affirmed in 1919 by the Afghan government with the signing of the [[Treaty of Rawalpindi]],<ref>Robson, ''Crisis on the Frontier'' pp. 136–7</ref> which ended the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] – a war in which Waziri tribesmen allied themselves with the forces of Afghanistan's King [[Amanullah]] in their resistance to British rule. The Wazirs and other tribes, taking advantage of instability on the frontier, [[Waziristan campaign (1919–20)|continued to resist British occupation until 1920]] – even after Afghanistan had signed a peace treaty with the British.

British campaigns to subdue tribesmen along the Durand Line, as well as three Anglo-Afghan wars, made travel between Afghanistan and the densely populated heartlands of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa increasingly difficult. The two regions were largely isolated from one another from the start of the Second Anglo-Afghan War in 1878 until the start of [[World War II]] in 1939 when conflict along the Afghan frontier largely dissipated. Concurrently, the British continued their large public works projects in the region, and extended the [[Great Indian Peninsula Railway]] into the region, which connected the modern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region to the plains of India to the east. Other projects, such as the [[Attock Bridge]], [[Islamia College University]], [[Khyber train safari|Khyber Railway]], and establishment of [[cantonments]] in [[Peshawar]], [[Kohat]], [[Mardan]], and [[Nowshera Cantonment|Nowshera]] further cemented British rule in the region. In 1901, the British carved out the northwest portions of Punjab Province to create the Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP), which was renamed "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa" in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |date=14 May 2018 |title=NWFP to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa |url=http://blog.travel-culture.com/2018/05/15/from-nwfp-to-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-an-overview/ |access-date=14 May 2018 |website=Blog.travel-culture.com |archive-date=15 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515112231/http://blog.travel-culture.com/2018/05/15/from-nwfp-to-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-an-overview/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The secular stance of Bacha Khan had driven a wedge between the [[ulama]] of the otherwise pro-[[Congress party of India|Congress]] (and pro-Indian unity) [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind|Jamiat Ulema Hind]] (JUH) and Bacha Khan's [[Khudai Khidmatgar]]s.

There were other tensions in the area as well, particularly those that involved agitations by Pashtun tribesmen against the Imperial government. For example, in 1936, a British Indian court ruled against the marriage of a Hindu girl allegedly converted to Islam in Bannu, after the girl's family filed a case of abduction and forced conversion.<ref name="Yousef Aboul-Enein">{{cite book |author=Yousef Aboul-Enein |title=The Secret War for the Middle East |author2=Basil Aboul-Enein |publisher=Naval Institute Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-1612513096 |page=153}}</ref> The ruling was based on the fact that the girl was a minor and was asked to make her decision of conversion and marriage after she reaches the age of majority, till then she was asked to live with a third party.<ref name="Yousef Aboul-Enein" /> After the girl's family filed a case, the court ruled in the family's favour, angering the local Muslims who had later gone on to lead attacks against the [[Bannu Brigade]].<ref name="Yousef Aboul-Enein" />

Such controversies stirred up anti-Hindu sentiments amongst the province's Muslim population.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Haroon |first=Sana |year=2008 |title=The Rise of Deobandi Islam in the North-West Frontier Province and Its Implications in Colonial India and Pakistan 1914–1996 |journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society |volume=18 |issue=1 |page=55 |jstor=27755911 |quote=The stance of the central JUH was pro-Congress, and accordingly the JUS supported the Congressite Khudai Khidmatgars through to the elections of 1937. However the secular stance of Ghaffar Khan, leader of the Khudai Khidmatgars, disparaging the role of religion in government and social leadership, was driving a wedge between the ulama of the JUS and the Khudai Khidmatgars, irrespective of the commitments of mutual support between the JUH and Congress leaderships. In trying to highlight the separateness and vulnerability of Muslims in a religiously diverse public space, the directives of the NWFP ulama began to veer away from simple religious injunctions to take on a communalist tone. The ulama highlighted 'threats' posed by Hindus to Muslims in the province. Accusations of improper behaviour and molestation of Muslim women were levelled against 'Hindu shopkeepers' in Nowshera. Sermons given by two JUS-connected maulvis in Nowshera declared the Hindus the 'enemies' of Islam and Muslims. Posters were distributed in the city warning Muslims not to buy or consume food prepared and sold by Hindus in the bazaars. In 1936, a Hindu girl was abducted by a Muslim in Bannu and then married to him. The government demanded the girl's return, But popular Muslim opinion, supported by a resolution passed by the Jamiyatul Ulama Bannu, demanded that she stay, stating that she had come of her free will, had converted to Islam, and was now lawfully married and had to remain with her husband. Government efforts to retrieve the girl led to accusations of the government being anti-Muslim and of encouraging apostasy, and so stirred up strong anti-Hindu sentiment across the majority Muslim NWFP.}}</ref> By 1947 the majority of the ulama in the province began supporting the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]]'s idea of Pakistan.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Haroon |first=Sana |year=2008 |title=The Rise of Deobandi Islam in the North-West Frontier Province and Its Implications in Colonial India and Pakistan 1914–1996 |journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=57–58 |jstor=27755911 |quote=By 1947 the majority of NWFP ulama supported the Muslim League idea of Pakistan.

Immediately prior to 1947 [[Partition of India]], the British held a [[1947 North-West Frontier Province referendum|referendum in the NWFP]] to allow voters to choose between joining India or Pakistan. The polling began on 6 July 1947 and the referendum results were made public on 20 July 1947. According to the official results, there were 572,798 registered voters, out of which 289,244 (99.02%) votes were cast in favour of Pakistan, while 2,874 (0.98%) were cast in favour of India. The Muslim League declared the results as valid since over half of all eligible voters backed the merger with Pakistan.<ref name=":2">{{cite book |author=Jeffrey J.

== Geography ==
[[File:River Swat Pakistan 3.jpg|thumb|Northern parts of the province feature forests and dramatic mountain scenery, as in [[Swat District]].]]

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa sits primarily on the [[Iranian plateau]] and comprises the junction where the slopes of the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains on the [[Eurasian Plate]] give way to the Indus-watered hills approaching [[South Asia]]. This situation has led to seismic activity in the past.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/419493/Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa/249136/Geography |title=Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (province, Pakistan) :: Geography |encyclopedia=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |access-date=25 May 2010 |archive-date=18 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518165219/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/419493/Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa/249136/Geography |url-status=live }}</ref> The famous [[Khyber Pass]] links the province to Afghanistan, while the [[Kohalla Bridge]] in [[Circle Bakote]] Abbottabad is a major crossing point over the [[Jhelum River]] in the east.

Geographically the province could be divided into two zones: the northern zone extending from the ranges of the [[Hindu Kush]] to the borders of the Peshawar basin and the southern zone extending from Peshawar to the Derajat basin.

The northern zone is cold and snowy in winters with heavy rainfall and pleasant summers with the exception of the Peshawar basin, which is hot in summer and cold in winter. It has moderate rainfall.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

The southern zone is arid with hot summers and relatively cold winters and scanty rainfall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dawn.com/2012/11/29/its-wintertime-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa/ |title=It's wintertime in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa &#124; Newspaper |publisher=Dawn.Com |date=29 November 2012 |access-date=24 May 2013 |archive-date=12 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212191514/http://dawn.com/2012/11/29/its-wintertime-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The Sheikh Badin Hills, a spur of clay and [[sandstone]] hills that stretch east from the Sulaiman Mountains to the [[Indus River]], separates [[Dera Ismail Khan District]] from the ''Marwat'' plains of the [[Lakki Marwat District|Lakki Marwat]].

===Climate===
The [[climate]] of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa varies immensely for a region of its size, encompassing most of the many climate types found in Pakistan. The province stretching southwards from the [[Baroghil Pass]] in the [[Hindu Kush]] covers almost six degrees of latitude; it is mainly a mountainous region. [[Dera Ismail Khan]] is one of the hottest places in South Asia while in the mountains to the north the weather is mild in the summer and intensely cold in the winter. The air is generally very dry; consequently, the daily and annual range of temperature is quite large.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V19_153.gif |title=North-West Frontier Province – Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 19, p. 147 |publisher=Dsal.uchicago.edu |access-date=25 May 2010 |archive-date=24 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524160041/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V19_153.gif |url-status=live }}</ref>

Rainfall also varies widely. Although large parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are typically dry, the province also contains the wettest parts of Pakistan in its eastern fringe especially in [[monsoon]] season from mid-June to mid-September.

[[File:Ghabral swatvalley x004.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ghabral]], [[Swat Valley]]]]

====Upper and Lower Chitral Districts====
[[Upper Chitral District]] and [[Lower Chitral District]], due to their location, are completely sheltered from the [[monsoon]] that controls the weather in eastern Pakistan, owing to its relatively westerly location and the shielding effect of the [[Nanga Parbat]] massif. In many ways, they have more in common regarding climate with [[Central Asia]] than South Asia.<ref name="Trekking">Mock, John and O'Neil, Kimberley; ''Trekking in the Karakoram and Hindukush''; p. 15 {{ISBN|0-86442-360-8}}</ref> The winters are generally cold even in the valleys, and heavy [[snow]] during the winter blocks passes and isolates the region. In the valleys, however, summers can be hotter than on the windward side of the mountains due to lower cloud cover: Chitral can reach {{convert|40|C|F}} frequently during this period.<ref>Mock and O'Neil; ''Trekking in the Karakoram and Hindukush''; pp. 18–19</ref> However, the humidity is extremely low during these hot spells and, as a result, the summer climate is less torrid than in the rest of the Indian subcontinent.

Most precipitation falls as thunderstorms or snow during winter and spring, so that the climate at the lowest elevations is [[Köppen climate classification|classed as]] [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] (''Csa''), [[continental Mediterranean climate|continental Mediterranean]] (''Dsa'') or [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] (''BSk''). Summers are extremely dry in the north of Chitral district and receive only a little rain in the south around [[Drosh]].

At elevations above {{convert|5000|m|ft|-2}}, as much as a third of the snow which feeds the large Karakoram and Hindukush [[glacier]]s comes from the monsoon since these elevations are too high to be shielded from its moisture.<ref name="Trekking"/>

On the southern flanks of [[Nanga Parbat]] and in [[Upper Dir District|Upper]] and [[Lower Dir District]]s, rainfall is much heavier than further north because moist winds from the [[Arabian Sea]] are able to penetrate the region. When they collide with the mountain slopes, winter depressions provide heavy precipitation. The [[monsoon]], although short, is generally powerful. As a result, the southern slopes of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are the wettest part of Pakistan. Annual rainfall ranges from around {{convert|500|mm|in}} in the most sheltered areas to as much as {{convert|1750|mm|in}} in parts of Abbottabad and Mansehra Districts.

This region's climate is classed at lower elevations as [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] (''Cfa'' in the west; ''Cwa'' in the east); whilst at higher elevations with a southerly aspect, it becomes classed as [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] (''Dfb''). However, accurate data for altitudes above {{convert|2000|m|ft|-1}} are practically nonexistent here, in Chitral, or in the south of the province.

The seasonality of rainfall in central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shows very marked gradients from east to west. At Dir, March remains the wettest month due to frequent frontal cloud bands, whereas in Hazara more than half the rainfall comes from the monsoon.<ref name="Wernsted">See Wernsted, Frederick L.; ''World Climatic Data''; published 1972 by Climatic Data Press; 522 pp. 31 cm.</ref> This creates a unique situation characterized by a bimodal rainfall regime, which extends into the southern part of the province described below.<ref name="Wernsted"/>

Since cold air from the [[Siberian High]] loses its chilling capacity upon crossing the vast Karakoram and Himalaya ranges, winters in central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are somewhat milder than in Chitral. [[Snow]] remains very frequent at high altitudes but rarely lasts long on the ground in the major towns and agricultural valleys. Outside of winter, temperatures in central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are not so hot as in Chitral. {{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Significantly higher humidity when the monsoon is active means that heat discomfort can be greater. However, even during the most humid periods the high altitudes typically allow for some relief from the heat overnight.<ref>[https://www.hko.gov.hk/m/article_e.htm?title=ele_00079] {{Dead link|date=December 2021|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

====Southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa====
As one moves further away from the foothills of the Himalaya and Karakoram ranges, the climate changes from the humid subtropical climate of the foothills to the typically [[arid climate]] of [[Sindh]], [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] and southern [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]].

Agriculture remains important and the main cash crops include wheat, maize, tobacco (in Swabi), rice, sugar beets, as well as fruits are grown in the province.

Some manufacturing and high-tech investments in Peshawar have helped improve job prospects for many locals, while trade in the province involves nearly every product. The bazaars in the province are renowned throughout Pakistan. Unemployment has been reduced due to the establishment of industrial zones.

Workshops throughout the province support the manufacture of small arms and weapons. The province accounts for at least 78% of the [[marble]] production in Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2006/05/23/000012009_20060523095241/Rendered/PDF/354991PK0rev0pdf.pdf|title=World Bank Pakistan Growth and Export Competitiveness|access-date=25 May 2010|archive-date=10 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210150333/http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2006/05/23/000012009_20060523095241/Rendered/PDF/354991PK0rev0pdf.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Social issues==
The [[Awami National Party]] sought to rename the province "Pakhtunkhwa", which translates to "Land of Pakhtuns" in the [[Pashto language]].<ref>{{cite web|title=NWFP to KPK|url=http://www.insightonconflict.org/2010/05/clashes-over-renaming-nwfp/|website=Insightonconflict.org|access-date=21 January 2015|archive-date=21 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121124000/http://www.insightonconflict.org/2010/05/clashes-over-renaming-nwfp/|url-status=dead}}</ref> This was opposed by some non-Pashtuns in the province and political parties such as the [[Pakistan Muslim League-N]] (PML-N) and [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal]] (MMA), due to the PML-N deriving its support in the province from primarily non-Pashtun [[Hazara people|Hazara]] regions.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has traditionally had a very low literacy rate, although this is changing in recent times. As of the 2017 census, the literacy rate for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (including FATA) is 51.66%. In rural areas, the literacy rate is 48.44% of the population while in urban areas it is 66.86%. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has a huge gap in literacy rate between sexes – for men it is 66.67% while the female literacy rate is 34.58%, just over half the male literacy rate. This gap is particularly prominent in the overwhelmingly-Pashto rural areas, where traditional gender norms have generally limited education of women. As of 2021, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) has the highest literacy growth rate in the whole country ([[Pakistan]]).<ref name="startuppakistan.com.pk"/><ref name="propakistani.pk"/>
