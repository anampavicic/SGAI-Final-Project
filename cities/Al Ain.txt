The city has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh''), featuring long, extremely hot summers and warm winters. In Al-Ain, the mean annual rainfall is {{convert|96|mm|in|abbr=on}} and the average relative humidity is 60% (United Arab Emirates University, 1993). Low humidity in Al-Ain, particularly during the summers, makes it a popular destination for many people during this time of the year. Boer (1997) classified the UAE climate as hyper-arid and divided it into four climatic regions: the coastal zone along the Persian [[Gulf]], the mountain areas northeast of UAE, the gravel plains around Al Ain, and the central and southern sand desert. More rainfall and lower temperature occur in the northeast than in the southern and western regions. The monthly average rainfall around Al-Ain was {{convert|100|–|120|mm|in|abbr=on}} from the period 1970 to 1992.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Al Ain was originally within the area of influence of the [[Dhawahir]], a Bedouin tribe who settled [[Ad Dhahirah Governorate|Dhahirah]] before [[Al Buraimi Governorate|Buraimi]]. A later wave of settlers, the [[Na'im]], have long had an uneasy relationship with the Dhawahir and the two tribes were frequently in dispute.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition (1941–)|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|year=2005|publisher=[[Motivate Publishing|Motivate]]|isbn=1860631673|location=London|page=48|oclc=64689681}}</ref> Numbering 4,500, the Dhawahir consists of three subsections: the [[Daramikah]], who populated [[Hili Archaeological Park|Hili]], Mutared and [[Qattara Oasis|Qattara]]; the Jawabir in Al Ain and the Bani Saad who lived in Jimi. Staying in the villages for the summer date season, in winter the community would move throughout the [[Trucial States]].

A number of interests jostled for influence over the tribes of Buraimi, including the [[List of rulers of Oman|Sultan of Muscat]], the [[Emirate of Nejd|Wahhabis]] (who had made a number of incursions) and the Sheikhs of the Trucial States, particularly the [[Bani Yas]] of Abu Dhabi, who acquired large tracts of land, principally from the Dhawahir. This [[suzerainty]] over Al Ain was cemented by Sheikh [[Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan]], known as 'Zayed the Great', a strong and charismatic leader who took the Dhawahir's main settlement 'Ain Dhawahir (the original name of Al Ain) when the tribe rebelled against him in 1877. He built a [[Al Jahili Fort|fort]], one of a number of fortifications established by the various interests vying for control over the oasis, to underline his dominion over the oasis and established a ''wali'', appointing a member of the Dhawahir as his headman.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition (1941–)|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|year=2005|publisher=[[Motivate Publishing|Motivate]]|isbn=1860631673|location=London|page=109|oclc=64689681}}</ref>

[[Wilfred Thesiger]] visited Al Ain in the late 1940s, during his travels across the [[Empty Quarter]]. He met Sheikh Zayed and stayed with him at [[Qasr Al Muwaiji|Al Muwaiji Fort]]. An ongoing [[Saudi Arabia–United Arab Emirates border dispute|dispute]] between [[Saudi Arabia]], Abu Dhabi and Oman led to the [[Buraimi Dispute]], a series of incidents which saw a Saudi armed force enter the oasis. Forces from the [[Trucial Oman Scouts]], as well as the army of Muscat-Oman, arrived to recapture the oasis. With British intervention, the Saudi forces surrendered, leaving the oasis back in the hands of Abu Dhabi and Oman.<ref name="ENA 12-2014" /><ref name="Al-Hosani2012" />
