'''Al Buraimi Governorate''' ({{langx|ar|مُحَافَظَة ٱلْبُرَيْمِي|Muḥāfaẓat Al-Buraimī}}) is one of the 11 [[Governorates of Oman|governorates]] of [[Oman]]. The area was part of [[Ad Dhahirah Region]] until October 2006, when a new governorate was created from the [[Wilayah|Wilayat]]s ([[Provinces of Oman|Provinces]]) of Al Buraymi and [[Mahdah]]. A third wilayat, As-[[Sunaynah]], was created from parts of the two. Dr. Hamad bin Ahmed Al Busaidi has been governor since 2020.<ref>{{cite web |title=His Majesty appoints new ministers |url=https://www.omanobserver.om/article/11305/Main/his-majesty-appoints-new-ministers |website=Oman Daily Observer |date=19 August 2020}}</ref>

===Buraimi Dispute===
{{Main|Buraimi dispute}}

The community of Al-Buraimi is probably best known as the result of an incident known as the "Buraimi Dispute."<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/MJB.htm "The Jebel Akhdar War Oman 1954-1959"] by Major John B. Meagher (USMC) Global Security Report</ref> The dispute arose from [[Saudi Arabia]]'s claim, first made in 1949, of sovereignty over a large part of [[Emirate of Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi]] territory where oil was suspected to be present and an area in a {{convert|20|mile|km}} circle around the centre of the Buraimi Oasis. The Saudis relied on historical precedent (the oasis was under [[Wahhabism|Wahhabi]] influence in the period between 1800 and 1870) for their claims, which were countered by arguments from Abu Dhabi and Muscat based on more recent events. 

The argument led to the 1950 London Agreement, whereby exploration and troop movements in the area would continue until the issue of sovereignty was resolved. Despite ongoing negotiations, the Saudis attempted to take back the oasis.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The Trucial States|last=Donald.|first=Hawley|date=1970|publisher=Allen & Unwin|isbn=0-04-953005-4|location=London|oclc=152680}} P 188</ref> In 1952 a group of some 80 Saudi Arabian guards, 40 of whom were armed, led by the Saudi [[Emir]] of [[Ras Tanura]], Turki Abdullah Al Otaishan, crossed Abu Dhabi territory and occupied [[Hamasa]], one of three Omani villages in the oasis, claiming it as part of the [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|eastern Province of Saudi Arabia]]. The [[List of rulers of Oman|Sulṭan of Muscat and Imam of Oman]] gathered his forces to expel the Saudis but was persuaded by the British government to exercise restraint pending attempts to settle the dispute by arbitration.<ref name="MR">{{cite book|url=http://www.ibtauris.com/Books/Humanities/History/History%20earliest%20times%20to%20present%20day/20th%20century%20history%20c%201900%20%20to%20c%202000/Postwar%2020th%20century%20history%20from%20c%201945%20to%20c%202000/Buraimi%20The%20Struggle%20for%20Power%20Influence%20and%20Oil%20in%20Arabia.aspx|title=Buraimi: The Struggle for Power, Influence and Oil in Arabia|last=Morton|first=Michael Quentin|publisher=IB Tauris|year=2013|isbn=978-1-84885-818-3|location=London|page=304}}</ref>

A standstill agreement was implemented and, on 30 July 1954, it was agreed to refer the dispute to an international arbitration tribunal.<ref>[http://untreaty.un.org/unts/1_60000/5/35/00009703.pdf UN]</ref> Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia embarked on a campaign of bribery to obtain declarations of tribal loyalty on which its case was based. In 1955 arbitration proceedings began in Geneva only to collapse when the British arbitrator, [[Reader Bullard|Sir Reader Bullard]], withdrew. A few weeks later, the Saudi party was forcibly ejected from Hamasa by the [[Trucial Oman Scouts|Trucial Oman Levies]], a paramilitary group raised by the British. Together with a few refugee sheikhs and their families, the Saudis were taken to [[Sharjah]] and dispatched to Saudi Arabia by sea. The dispute was finally settled in 1974 by an agreement, known as the [[Treaty of Jeddah (1974)|Treaty of Jeddah]], between Sheikh Zayed (then President of the UAE) and King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]].<ref name=MR />
