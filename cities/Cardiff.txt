==Etymology==
{{lang|cy|Caerdydd}} (the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name of the city) derives from the [[Middle Welsh]] {{lang|wlm|Caerdyf}}. The change from {{lang|wlm|-dyf}} to {{lang|cy|-dydd}} shows the colloquial alteration of Welsh ''f'' {{IPA|cy|v|}} and ''dd'' {{IPA|cy|ð|}} and was perhaps also driven by [[folk etymology]]. This [[sound change]] probably first occurred in the [[Middle Ages]]; both forms were current in the [[Tudor period]]. {{lang|wlm|Caerdyf}} has its origins in [[sub-Roman Britain|post-Roman]] [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] words meaning "the fort of the [[River Taff|Taff]]". The [[Cardiff Roman Fort|fort]] probably refers to that established by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]]. {{lang|cy|Caer}} is Welsh for ''fort'' and {{lang|cy|-dyf}} is in effect a form of {{lang|cy|Taf}} (Taff), the river which flows by Cardiff Castle, with the {{angle bracket|t}} showing [[consonant mutation]] to {{angle bracket|d}} and the vowel showing [[affection (linguistics)|affection]] as a result of a (lost) [[genitive case]] ending.<ref name=hwo>Hywel Wyn Owen and Richard Morgan, ''Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales''. University of Wales Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-84323-901-9}}, p. 70.</ref>

The [[anglicised]] ''Cardiff'' is derived from {{lang|wlm|Caerdyf}}, with the Welsh ''f'' {{IPA|cy|v|}} borrowed as ''ff'' {{IPAc-en|f|}}, as also happens in ''Taff'' (from Welsh {{lang|cy|Taf}}) and ''[[Llandaff]]'' (from Welsh {{lang|cy|Llandaf}}).

The antiquarian [[William Camden]] (1551–1623) suggested that the name Cardiff may derive from *{{lang|wlm|Caer-Didi}} ("the Fort of Didius"), a name supposedly given in honour of {{lang|la|[[Aulus Didius Gallus]]|italic=no}}, governor of a nearby province at the time when the Roman fort was established. Although some sources repeat this theory, it has been rejected on linguistic grounds by modern scholars such as Professor {{lang|cy|Gwynedd|italic=no}} Pierce.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/videoexplorer/pages/?jumpTo=cardiff |title=What's In A Name? – Cardiff |last=Pierce |first=Gwynedd O |publisher=BBC Wales |access-date=17 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115122320/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/videoexplorer/pages/?jumpTo=cardiff |archive-date=15 January 2009}}</ref>

Until the [[Roman conquest of Britain]], Cardiff was part of the territory of the [[Silures]] – a [[Iron Age tribes in Britain|Celtic British tribe]] that flourished in the [[Iron Age]] – whose territory included the areas that would become known as [[Breconshire]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] and Glamorgan.<ref name="Wales Hist 1">{{Cite book |last=Davies |first=John |author-link=John Davies (historian) |title=A History of Wales |publisher=Penguin |year=1994 |location=London |pages=17–18 |isbn=0-14-014581-8}}</ref> The {{cvt|3.2|ha|acre|frac=4|adj=on}} [[Cardiff Roman Fort|fort]] established by the [[Roman army|Romans]] near the mouth of the [[River Taff]] in AD&nbsp;75, in what would become the north western boundary of the centre of Cardiff, was built over an extensive settlement that had been established by the Romans in the 50s&nbsp;AD.<ref name="Coflein 2">{{Cite web |title=Cardiff Roman settlement – Site details – coflein |url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/301346/details/CARDIFF+ROMAN+SETTLEMENT/ |access-date=10 June 2009 |publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales |date=30 August 2007 |work=RCAHMW website |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727072730/http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/301346/details/CARDIFF+ROMAN+SETTLEMENT/ |archive-date=27 July 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> The fort was one of a series of military outposts associated with {{lang|la|[[Isca Augusta]]}} ([[Caerleon]]) that acted as border defences.

Little is known of the fort and civilian settlement in the period between the Roman departure from Britain and the Norman Conquest. The settlement probably shrank in size and may even have been abandoned. In the absence of Roman rule, Wales was divided into small kingdoms; early on, [[Meurig ap Tewdrig]] emerged as the local king in [[Glywysing]] (which later became [[Glamorgan]]). The area passed through his family until the advent of the Normans in the 11th century.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rees |first=William |title=Cardiff: A History of the City |publisher=The Corporation of the City of Cardiff |year=1969 |pages=4–5}}</ref>

The town grew rapidly from the 1830s onwards, when the [[John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute|Marquess of Bute]] built a [[dock (maritime)|dock]], which eventually linked to the [[Taff Vale Railway]]. Cardiff became the main port for coal exports from the [[Cynon Valley|Cynon]], [[Rhondda]], and [[Rhymney Valley|Rhymney]] valleys, and grew in population at a rate of nearly 80 per cent per decade between 1840 and 1870.

Cardiff faced a challenge in the 1880s when [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies of Llandinam]] and the [[Barry Railway Company]] promoted rival docks at [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]]. These had the advantage of being accessible in all [[tide]]s: David Davies claimed his venture would cause "grass to grow in the streets of Cardiff". From 1901 coal exports from Barry surpassed those from Cardiff, but the administration of the coal trade remained centred on Cardiff, in particular its [[Coal Exchange]], where the price of coal on the British market was determined and the first million-pound deal was struck in 1907.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Wales"/> The city also strengthened its industrial base when the owners of the [[Dowlais Ironworks]] in Merthyr (who would later form part of [[GKN|Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds]]) built a [[steel mill|steelworks]] close to the docks at East Moors, which Lord Bute opened on 4 February 1891.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.archivesnetworkwales.info/cgi-bin/anw/fulldesc_nofr?inst_id=33&coll_id=77663&expand= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104023150/http://www.archivesnetworkwales.info/cgi-bin/anw/fulldesc_nofr?inst_id=33&coll_id=77663&expand= |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 January 2009 |title=East Moors Steelworks, Cardiff collection (record of information achival) |date=1 February 2006 |publisher=Glamorgan Records Office |access-date=2 October 2008}}</ref>

Later, more national institutions came to the city, including the [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum of Wales]], the [[Welsh National War Memorial]], and the [[University of Wales]] Registry Building, but it was denied the [[National Library of Wales]], partly because the library's founder, Sir John Williams, considered Cardiff to have "a non-Welsh population".<ref name="Encyclopedia of Wales"/>

After a brief post-war boom, Cardiff docks entered a prolonged decline in the [[interwar period]]. By 1936, trade was at less than half its value in 1913, reflecting the slump in demand for [[South Wales coalfield|Welsh coal]].<ref name="Encyclopedia of Wales"/> Bomb damage in the [[Cardiff Blitz]] of World War II included the devastation of [[Llandaff Cathedral]], and in the immediate postwar years, the city's link with the Bute family came to an end.

The city was recognised as the [[Capital of Wales|capital city of Wales]] on 20 December 1955, in a written reply by the [[Home Secretary]], [[Gwilym Lloyd George, 1st Viscount Tenby|Gwilym Lloyd George]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1955-12-20/debates/f75e8a8b-79d6-42d2-96be-80f271ffe0b1/CapitalOfPrincipality(Cardiff) |title=Capital of Principality (Cardiff) (Hansard, 20 December 1955) |website=hansard.millbanksystems.com |access-date=30 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830234559/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1955/dec/20/capital-of-principality-cardiff |archive-date=30 August 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[Caernarfon]] had also vied for the title.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Cardiff as Capital of Wales: Formal Recognition by Government |newspaper=The Times |date=21 December 1955}}</ref> Welsh local authorities had been divided: only 76 out of 161 chose Cardiff in a 1924 poll organised by the ''South Wales Daily News''.<ref name="Johnes 2012">{{Cite journal |author=Prof. Martin Johnes |url=https://www.academia.edu/716868 |title=Cardiff: The Making and Development of the Capital City of Wales |year=2012 |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=509–28 |journal=Contemporary British History |doi=10.1080/13619462.2012.676911 |s2cid=144368404 |access-date=11 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190511111542/https://www.academia.edu/716868/Cardiff_The_Making_and_Development_of_the_Capital_City_of_Wales |archive-date=11 May 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The subject was not debated again until 1950, and meanwhile Cardiff took steps to promote its "Welshness". The stalemate between Cardiff and cities such as Caernarfon and Aberystwyth was not broken until Cardiganshire County Council decided to support Cardiff; and in a new local authority vote, 134 out of 161 voted for Cardiff.<ref name="Johnes 2012"/>

Cardiff therefore celebrated two important [[anniversary|anniversaries]] in 2005. The Encyclopedia of Wales notes that the decision to recognise the city as the capital of Wales "had more to do with the fact that it contained marginal [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] constituencies than any reasoned view of what functions a Welsh capital should have." Although the city hosted the [[Commonwealth Games]] in 1958, Cardiff became a centre of national administration only with the establishment of the [[Welsh Office]] in 1964, which later prompted the creation of various other public bodies such as the [[Arts Council of Wales]] and the [[Welsh Development Agency]], most of which were based in Cardiff.

In the [[1997 Welsh devolution referendum]], Cardiff voters rejected the establishment of the National Assembly for Wales by 55.4% to 44.2% on a 47% turnout, which Denis Balsom partly ascribed to a general preference in Cardiff and some other parts of Wales for a British rather than exclusively Welsh [[national identity|identity]].<ref>Denis Balsom, "The referendum result".

The Senedd (Welsh Parliament; {{Lang-cy|Senedd Cymru}}) has been based in Cardiff Bay since its formation in 1999 as the "National Assembly for Wales". The Senedd building was opened on 1 March 2006 by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|The Queen]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/tm_objectid=16757822&method=full&siteid=50082&headline=queen-to-open-wales--senedd-name_page.html |title=Queen to open Wales' Senedd |date=1 March 2006 |publisher=WalesOnline.co.uk |access-date=22 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120055847/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/tm_objectid=16757822&method=full&siteid=50082&headline=queen-to-open-wales--senedd-name_page.html |archive-date=20 January 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Member of the Senedd|Members of the Senedd]] (MSs), the Senedd Commission and ministerial support staff are based in Cardiff Bay.

Cardiff elects four constituency Members of the Senedd to the Senedd; the constituencies for the Senedd are the same as for the UK Parliament. All of the city's electors have an extra vote for the [[South Wales Central (Senedd electoral region)|South Wales Central]] regional members; this system increases proportionality to the Senedd. The most recent Senedd general election was held on [[2021 Senedd election|6 May 2021]].

In the Senedd, Cardiff is represented by [[Jenny Rathbone]] (Labour) in [[Cardiff Central (Senedd constituency)|Cardiff Central]], [[Julie Morgan]] (Labour) in [[Cardiff North (Senedd constituency)|Cardiff North]], former First Minister [[Mark Drakeford]] (Labour) in [[Cardiff West (Senedd constituency)|Cardiff West]] and former First Minister [[Vaughan Gething]] (Labour) in [[Cardiff South and Penarth (Senedd constituency)|Cardiff South and Penarth]].

Between 1889 and 1974 Cardiff was a county borough governed by [[Cardiff County Borough Council]] (known as Cardiff City Council after 1905). Between 1974 and 1996, Cardiff was governed by [[Cardiff City Council]], a district council of [[South Glamorgan]]. Since [[Local Government (Wales) Act 1994|local government reorganisation in 1996]], Cardiff has been governed by the City and County Council of Cardiff, based at [[County Hall, Cardiff|County Hall]] in Atlantic Wharf, Cardiff Bay. Voters elect 75 councillors every four years.

Between the 2004 and 2012 local elections, no individual political party held a majority on Cardiff County Council. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] held the largest number of seats and Cllr [[Rodney Berman]] was Leader of the council.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/content.asp?nav=2872%2C4274%2C4956&parent_directory_id=2865 |title=Council Composition |date=14 May 2008 |publisher=Cardiff County Council |access-date=22 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927042410/http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/content.asp?Parent_Directory_id=2865&nav=2872%2C4274%2C4956 |archive-date=27 September 2006}}</ref> The Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru formed a partnership administration.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics-news/2008/05/13/lib-dems-and-plaid-set-for-a-coalition-in-cardiff-91466-20899896/ |title=Lib Dems and Plaid set for a coalition in Cardiff |last=Shipton |first=Martin |date=13 May 2008 |publisher=WalesOnline |access-date=22 October 2008 |archive-date=28 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210528130543/https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/lib-dems-plaid-set-coalition-2176063 |url-status=live}}</ref> In the [[2012 Cardiff Council election|2012 elections]] the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] achieved an outright majority, after gaining an additional 33 seats across the city.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Cardiff}}
The centre of Cardiff is relatively flat and bounded by hills to the east, north and west. Its location influenced its development as the world's largest coal port, notably its proximity and easy access to the coalfields of the [[South Wales Valleys]]. The highest point in the local authority area is [[Garth Hill]], {{cvt|307|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

Cardiff is built on reclaimed marshland on a bed of [[Triassic]] stones. This reclaimed marshland stretches from [[Chepstow]] to the [[Ely Estuary]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=7004 |title=Cardiff Supplementary Planning Guidance: Archaeologically Sensitive Areas |date=20 July 2006 |publisher=Cardiff County Council |access-date=1 October 2008 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609181416/http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=7004 |archive-date=9 June 2011}}</ref> which is the natural boundary of Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan. Triassic landscapes of this part of the world are usually shallow and low-lying, consistent with the flatness of the centre of Cardiff.<ref>{{Cite journal |year=2008 |title=Discussion on palaeoecology of the Late Triassic extinction event in the SW UK |journal=Journal of the Geological Society |publisher=Geological Society of London |volume=165 |issue=5 |pages=988–992 |url=http://jgs.lyellcollection.org/cgi/content/full/165/5/988 |access-date=1 October 2008 |doi=10.1144/0016-76492008-014 |last1=Radley |first1=J.

Many of these Triassic rocks are purplish, especially the coastal marl found near Penarth. One of the Triassic rocks used in Cardiff is "Radyr Stone", a [[freestone (masonry)|freestone]] which as its name suggests is quarried in the Radyr district.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.englishstone.org.uk/documents/dimension%20stone%208.html |title=Triassic building sandstone resources |access-date=7 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610061832/http://www.englishstone.org.uk/documents/dimension%20stone%208.html |archive-date=10 June 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> Cardiff has also imported some materials for buildings: [[Devonian]] sandstones (the [[Old Red Sandstone]]) from the [[Brecon Beacons]] has been used. Most famously, the buildings of [[Cathays Park]], the civic centre in the centre of the city, are built of [[Portland stone]] from Dorset.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.swga.org.uk/pdf/CathaysPark.pdf |title=Geological Walks in Wales: Cathays Park |publisher=Geologists Association South Wales |access-date=22 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029202443/http://www.swga.org.uk/pdf/CathaysPark.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> A widely used building stone in Cardiff is the yellow-grey [[Early Jurassic|Liassic]] [[limestone]] rock of the Vale of Glamorgan, including the rare "Sutton Stone", a conglomerate of lias limestone and [[carboniferous]] limestone.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.castlewales.com/morgraig.html |title=Castell Morgraig |last=Iowerth |first=Dylan |journal=Castle Studies Group Newsletter |year=1998 |access-date=22 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907230838/http://castlewales.com/morgraig.html |archive-date=7 September 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Cardiff is bordered to the west by the rural district of the Vale of Glamorgan, also known as the Garden of Cardiff,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gardenofcardiff.com/ |title=The Garden of Cardiff |access-date=20 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509082545/http://www.gardenofcardiff.com/ |archive-date=9 May 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> to the east by the city of Newport; to the north by the [[South Wales Valleys]], and to the south by the [[River Severn|Severn Estuary]] and [[Bristol Channel]]. The River Taff winds through the city centre and together with the [[River Ely]] flows into the freshwater Cardiff Bay. A third river, the [[Rhymney River|Rhymney]], flows through the east of the city directly into the Severn Estuary.

Cardiff lies near the [[Glamorgan]] [[Heritage Coast]], stretching westward from Penarth and Barry – [[commuter town]]s of Cardiff – with striped yellow-blue [[Jurassic]] limestone cliffs. The Glamorgan coast is the only part of the [[Celtic Sea]] with exposed Jurassic ([[blue lias]]) geology. This stretch of coast with its reefs, sandbanks and serrated cliffs was a [[ship graveyard]]; many ships sailing to Cardiff during the industrial era were wrecked on this hostile coastline during west/south-westerly gales. Smuggling, deliberate shipwrecking and attacks on ships were also common.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kenfig.org.uk/smuggling.html |title=Smuggling Around Kenfig |publisher=Kenfig.org |access-date=19 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422181813/http://www.kenfig.org.uk/smuggling.html |archive-date=22 April 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>

With the exception of some outlying privately built estates at [[Michaelston-super-Ely]], this is an economically disadvantaged area with high numbers of unemployed households. [[Culverhouse Cross]] is a more affluent western area of the city. [[Fairwater, Cardiff|Fairwater]], [[Heath, Cardiff|Heath]], [[Birchgrove, Cardiff|Birchgrove]], [[Gabalfa]], [[Mynachdy]], [[Llandaff North]], [[Llandaff]], [[Llanishen]], [[Radyr]], [[Whitchurch, Cardiff|Whitchurch]] & [[Tongwynlais]], [[Rhiwbina]], [[Thornhill, Cardiff|Thornhill]], [[Lisvane]] and [[Cyncoed]] lie in an arc from the north-west to the north-east of the centre. Lisvane, Cyncoed, Radyr and Rhiwbina contain some of the most expensive housing in Wales.

Further east lie the wards of Pontprennau and Old St Mellons, Rumney, [[Pentwyn, Cardiff|Pentwyn]], [[Llanrumney]], [[Llanedeyrn]] and [[Trowbridge, Cardiff|Trowbridge]]. The last four are largely public housing stock, although much new private housing is being built in Trowbridge.

Cardiff has a chequered linguistic history with [[Welsh language|Welsh]], English, [[Latin]], [[Old Norse|Norse]] and [[Norman language|Norman French]] preponderant at different times.

Though the population of Cardiff is about 10% of the Welsh population, the economy of Cardiff makes up nearly 20% of Welsh GDP and 40% of the city's workforce are daily in-commuters from the surrounding South Wales area.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/articles/economic_trends/Sub-regional_&_Local_Area_GDP.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924210535/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/articles/economic_trends/Sub-regional_%26_Local_Area_GDP.pdf |archive-date=24 September 2009 |url-status=dead |title=Sub-regional and local area gross domestic product |last=Clifton-Fearnside |first=Alex |author2=Adam Douglas |date=14 May 2002 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |access-date=18 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.statswales.wales.gov.uk/TableViewer/document.aspx?ReportId=4903&IF_Language=isl |title=Statistics on Commuting in Wales |date=5 December 2007 |publisher=Statistics for Wales |access-date=18 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114021425/http://www.statswales.wales.gov.uk/TableViewer/document.aspx?ReportId=4903&IF_Language=isl |archive-date=14 January 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Industry has played a major part in Cardiff's development for many centuries. The main catalyst for its transformation from a small town into a big city was the demand for coal required in making iron and later steel, brought to sea by [[packhorse]] from [[Merthyr Tydfil]]. This was first achieved by building a {{convert|25|mi|km|adj=on|abbr=out}} canal from Merthyr ({{cvt|510|ft|m|disp=or}} above sea level) to the [[Taff Estuary]] at Cardiff.<ref name="canal">{{Cite web |url=http://www.alangeorge.co.uk/the_glamorganshire_canal.htm |title=The Glamorganshire Canal |access-date=19 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227160758/http://www.alangeorge.co.uk/the_glamorganshire_canal.htm |archive-date=27 December 2007}}</ref> Eventually the [[Taff Vale Railway]] replaced the canal barges and massive marshalling yards sprang up as new docks were developed in Cardiff – all prompted by the soaring worldwide demand for coal from the South Wales valleys.

At its peak, Cardiff's port area, known as [[Tiger Bay]], became the busiest port in the world and – for some time – the world's most important coal port.<ref name="Grauniad Dinas">{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/jun/09/walk-guides-cardiff-wales-architecture?page=2 |title=Cardiff's millennium makeover, Cardiff – Travel |access-date=2 June 2010 |date=9 June 2009 |work=The Guardian |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606214328/http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/jun/09/walk-guides-cardiff-wales-architecture?page=2 |archive-date=6 June 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="BBC Dinas">{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2854567.stm |title=Capital claims – A city's struggle |access-date=2 June 2010 |date=22 April 2003 |work=BBC News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040713044548/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2854567.stm |archive-date=13 July 2004 |url-status=live}}</ref> In the years leading up to the [[First World War]], more than 10 million tonnes of coal was exported annually from [[Cardiff Docks]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/?article_id=50 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120530052329/http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/?article_id=50 |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 May 2012 |title=Cardiff – Coal and Shipping Metropolis of the World |publisher=National Museum of Wales |access-date=19 April 2008}}</ref> In 1907, Cardiff's [[Coal Exchange]] was the first host to a business deal for a million [[Pound Sterling|pounds Sterling]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.glamro.gov.uk/check/Building%20of%20a%20Capital%202/A_Why.html |title=Why Did Cardiff Grow? |publisher=Glamorgan Record Office |access-date=19 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123034747/http://www.glamro.gov.uk/check/Building%20of%20a%20Capital%202/A_Why.html |archive-date=23 November 2008}}</ref> The high demand for Welsh coal and specifically Welsh artificial fuel, named Patent Fuel, is shown by the numerous factories producing this fuel, with the same recipe, in the region of Cardiff.

It runs through Bute Park, [[Sophia Gardens]] and many other green areas within Cardiff. It is possible to cycle the entire distance of the [[Trail]] almost completely off-road, as it largely follows the [[River Taff]] and many of the disused railways of the Glamorganshire valleys.

[[Nextbike]] previously operated a public bike-hire scheme in the city between March 2018 and January 2024,<ref>{{Cite news |date=8 December 2023 |title=Nextbike Cardiff: Bike sharing scheme scrapped due to theft |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67646004 |access-date=3 February 2024 |work=BBC News |language=en-GB}}</ref> with the scheme allegedly being scrapped due to theft.

==Telecommunications==
{{See also|List of Wales dialling codes}}
'''029''' is the current telephone dialling code for Cardiff,<ref name="wales online 02921">{{cite news|last=Malone |first=Sam |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/new-029-22-cardiff-telephone-2731565 |title=New phone numbers for Cardiff as first sets of 029 prefixes begin running out |work=Wales Online |date=18 April 2013 |access-date=29 May 2023 }}</ref> as well as for the neighbouring towns of Penarth, Dinas Powys and [[Caerphilly]]. The dialling code is optional when dialling within the area: one can dial between any two phones within the 029 code using only the eight-digit local number.

Prior to the [[Big Number Change]] on 22 April 2000 the area had shorter, six-digit local numbers with an area code of 01222.<ref name="wales online 02921" /> This was 0222 before May 1995, derived from 0 (indicating it was a trunk call), 22 (CA on a telephone pad, for CArdiff) and 2 (as 220 was used for CAmbridge and 221 for BAth). Before the introduction of automated trunk call dialling, non-local numbers were accessed through a system of manual telephone exchanges, in common with rest if the United Kingdom.

There remains a common misconception that local numbers are still six digits long and that the code is 02920, even though there are newer Cardiff numbers in the ranges (029) 21xx xxxx and (029) 22xx xxxx.<ref name="wales online 02921" />

Cardiff has many landmark buildings such as the Principality Stadium, [[Pierhead Building]], the Welsh National Museum and the Senedd building, the home of the Welsh Parliament. Cardiff is also known for Cardiff Castle, [[St David's Hall]], [[St John the Baptist Church, Cardiff|St John the Baptist Church]], [[Llandaff Cathedral]] and the [[Wales Millennium Centre]].

[[Cardiff Castle]] is a major tourist attraction in the city and is situated in the heart of the [[Cardiff city centre|city centre]]. The [[St Fagans National History Museum|National History Museum at St Fagans]] in Cardiff is a large open-air museum housing dozens of buildings from throughout Welsh history that have been moved to the site in Cardiff. The Civic Centre in [[Cathays Park]] comprises a collection of [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] buildings such as the [[City Hall, Cardiff|City Hall]], [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum and Gallery of Wales]], [[Cardiff Crown Court]], and buildings forming part of Cardiff University, together with more modern civic buildings. These buildings are laid out around the Queen Alexandra Gardens, a formal park which contains the [[Welsh National War Memorial]] and a number of other, smaller memorials.

In addition to Cardiff Castle, [[Castell Coch]] is a castle in [[Tongwynlais]], in the north of the city. The current castle is an elaborately decorated Victorian [[folly]] designed by [[William Burges]] for the Marquess and built in the 1870s, as an occasional retreat. However, the Victorian castle stands on the footings of a much older medieval castle possibly built by [[Ifor Bach]], a regional baron with links to Cardiff Castle also. The exterior has become a popular location for film and television productions. It rarely fulfilled its intended role as a retreat for the Butes, who seldom stayed there. For the Marquess, the pleasure had been in its creation, a pleasure lost following Burges's death in 1881.

Cardiff claims the largest concentration of [[castles]] of any city in the world.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/rugbyunion/World_Cup/Story/0,21043,13092_2689478,00.html |title=2007 Rugby World Cup City Guides – Cardiff |publisher=Sky Sports |access-date=19 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405094448/http://www.skysports.com/rugbyunion/World_Cup/Story/0%2C21043%2C13092_2689478%2C00.html |archive-date=5 April 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> As well as Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch, there are the remains of two [[motte-and-bailey castle]]s in [[Morganstown]] and [[Rhiwbina]], known as [[Morganstown Castle Mound]] and [[Twmpath Castle]] or Twmpath Motte (also known as {{lang|cy|Caer Cynwrig}}) respectively.<ref name="Morganstown">{{Cadw|uid=3373|class=SM|num=GM256|desc=Morganstown Castle Mound |access-date=24 April 2021 |archive-date=24 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210424071247/https://cadwpublic-api.azurewebsites.net/reports/sam/FullReport?lang=&id=3373 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Twmpath Motte">{{Cadw|uid=3465|class=SM|num=GM017|desc=Twmpath, Rhiwbina |access-date=24 April 2021 |archive-date=24 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210424064805/https://cadwpublic-api.azurewebsites.net/reports/sam/FullReport?lang=&id=3465 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Twmpath]] being a Welsh word for a small mound),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.castlewales.com/twmpath.html |title=Twmpath Castle |year=2002 |access-date=21 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307035335/http://www.castlewales.com/twmpath.html |archive-date=7 March 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> which along with a castle at Whitchurch (known as Treoda and destroyed by housing in the 1960s) formed an arc of fortifications which divided the Norman lordship from the Welsh lordship of Senghenydd.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/Welshsites/482.html |title=The Gatehouse: Treoda, Whitchurch |date=8 October 2007 |access-date=28 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815082212/http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/Welshsites/482.html |archive-date=15 August 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> Further up the Cefn Cibwr ridge on the boundary with Caerphilly there is also another ruined castle, known as [[Morgraig Castle]] ({{lang-cy|Castell Morgraig}}). Archaeological evidence suggests this castle was never finished, and it is debated whether the fortification was of Norman or Welsh origin. The concentration of castles indicates the moveable nature of the border between the Norman lordship of Glamorgan, centred at Cardiff, and its Welsh neighbours to the north.

There is also the ruined [[Bishop's Palace, Llandaff|Llandaff Bishop's Palace]], also known as Llandaff Castle,<ref name="Britannica">{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Llandaff |title=Llandaff |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] |access-date=5 April 2021 |archive-date=6 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210206235749/https://www.britannica.com/place/Llandaff |url-status=live}}</ref> which was the home of the medieval bishops, which was destroyed about 1403–1404 by the Welsh leader [[Owain Glyndŵr]]. Now only the ruined gatehouse remains.<ref name="Britannica"/> Not strictly a castle in the historical sense, [[St Fagans National History Museum|Saint Fagans Castle]] is a preserved 17th-century manor house, once the seat of the [[Earl of Plymouth|Earls of Plymouth]].
