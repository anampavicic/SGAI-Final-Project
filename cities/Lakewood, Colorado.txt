'''Lakewood''' is the [[List of municipalities in Colorado#Home rule municipality|home rule municipality]] that is the [[List of municipalities in Colorado|most populous municipality]] in [[Jefferson County, Colorado]], United States.<ref name=COMun/> The city population was 155,984 at the [[2020 U.S. Census]], making Lakewood the [[List of municipalities in Colorado|fifth most populous city]] in [[Colorado]] and the [[list of United States cities by population|167th most populous city]] in the United States.<ref name=COMun/> Lakewood is a [[suburb]] of [[Denver]] and is a principal city of the [[Denver–Aurora–Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area]] and a major city of the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]].

==History==
The urban and suburban development of the community known as Lakewood was started in 1889 by Charles Welch and [[William A.H. Loveland|W.A.H. Loveland]], who platted a 13-block area along [[Colfax Avenue]] west of Denver in eastern Jefferson County. Loveland, the former president of the [[Colorado Central Railroad]], retired to the new community of Lakewood after many years of living in [[Golden, Colorado|Golden]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Until 1969, the area known as Lakewood had no municipal government, relying instead on several [[special-purpose district|water districts]], several fire districts, and the government of Jefferson County. Lakewood was a community with policing provided by the Jefferson County Sheriff, several volunteer-staffed fire districts, and some neighborhoods without street lights or sidewalks. However, the community had already existed for about 80&nbsp;years.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The City of Lakewood was [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1969 as Jefferson City. Soon after, an election was held and the city's name was changed to Lakewood, due to an overwhelming dislike of "Jefferson City" and the belief that it would be confused with existing communities in Colorado and Missouri.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.coloradocommunitymedia.com/stories/Lakewoods-come-a-long-way,11766 |title=Lakewood's come a long way |first=LeRoy |last=Standish |newspaper=Colorado Community Media}}</ref> At the time of incorporation, the city population was already over 90,000.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Lakewood never had a traditional downtown area.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} West [[Colfax Avenue]] served the metropolitan area as [[U.S. Route 40 in Colorado|U.S. Route&nbsp;40]] and the main route joining Denver with the [[Rocky Mountains]]. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}} As such, Colfax from Harlan west to Kipling and beyond had mostly commercial establishments. In addition to the [[Jewish Consumptives' Relief Society]] (JCRS) for tuberculosis patients, the small, frame Methodist Church, and telephone exchange, by the 1950s grocery and drug stores, gas stations, restaurants and taverns, several motels, branch banks, a movie theater, a roller rink, a bowling alley, and used car lots emerged there. Several multiple-business "shopping centers" developed followed by much larger centers at JCRS and Westland. The Villa Italia Mall on West Alameda Avenue, 20 blocks south of Colfax, reflected the southward expansion of the Lakewood settlement and housed a larger concentration of retail space. As the mall went into decline, the Lakewood City Council developed a plan to demolish the Villa Italia Mall and replace it with a new development called Belmar.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2009/0522/after-the-mall-retrofitting-suburbia |title=After the mall: Retrofitting suburbia |author=The Christian Science Monitor |date=May 22, 2009 |newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor}}</ref>

In 2011, Lakewood was named an [[All-America City]] for the first time.

===December 2021 rampage===
On December 27, 2021, a Denver gunman killed three Denver residents and two Lakewood residents before being killed by seriously wounded Lakewood Police Agent Ashley Ferris.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2021/12/29/lakewood-police-ashley-ferris-shooting-spree/|title=Lakewood police agent shot on Monday in exchange with the suspected killer is identified|work=[[The Denver Post]]|last=Nicholson|first=Kieran|date=December 29, 2021|access-date=August 25, 2022}}</ref>

==Geography==
Lakewood is located at the junction of [[U.S. Route 6]] and [[Colorado State Highway 121]] in central Colorado, the city lies immediately west of Denver and {{convert|62|mi|km}} north-northwest of Colorado Springs.<ref name=GoogleMaps>{{cite web | title = Lakewood, CO | publisher = [[Google Maps]] | url = https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lakewood,+CO/@39.7212143,-105.088998,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x876b816f5cdd72b7:0x9e905dfaf1d0ce97 | access-date = March 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Distance Calculator | publisher = Infoplease | url = http://www.infoplease.com/atlas/calculate-distance.html | access-date = March 4, 2015}}</ref>

Lakewood lies in the [[Colorado Piedmont]] on the western edge of the [[Great Plains]] just east of the [[Front Range]] of the [[southern Rocky Mountains]].<ref name=GoogleMaps/><ref>{{cite web | title = Physiographic Provinces of Colorado [Map] | publisher = Colorado Geological Survey | url = http://coloradogeologicalsurvey.org/colorado-geology/topography/physiographic/ | access-date = March 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = General Map of Colorado | work = Colorado Life Zones | url = http://shelledy.mesa.k12.co.us/staff/computerlab/ColoradoLifeZones_Maps.htm | access-date = March 4, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303222110/http://shelledy.mesa.k12.co.us/staff/computerlab/ColoradoLifeZones_Maps.htm | archive-date = March 3, 2016 | url-status = dead }}</ref> [[Green Mountain (Lakewood, Colorado)|Green Mountain]], a {{convert|6854|ft|m|-tall|adj=mid}} mesa, is located in the far west-central part of the city.<ref name=GoogleMaps/>

The city is located in the watershed of the [[South Platte River]], and several small tributaries of the river flow generally east through it. From north to south, these include [[Lakewood Gulch]], Weir Gulch, Sanderson Gulch, and [[Bear Creek (Colorado)|Bear Creek]]. Two tributaries of Lakewood Gulch, Dry Gulch, and McIntyre Gulch flow east through the northern part of the city. Turkey Creek, a tributary of Bear Creek, flows northeast through the far southwestern part of the city. In addition, Lena Gulch, a tributary of [[Clear Creek (Colorado)|Clear Creek]] to the north, flows east then north through the extreme northwestern part of the city.<ref name=GoogleMaps/>

Several small lakes and reservoirs are in Lakewood. The Soda Lakes lie in the extreme southwestern part of the city. East of them lies Bear Creek Lake, a reservoir fed by Bear Creek and Turkey Creek. Clustered near each other in central Lakewood are Main Reservoir, East Reservoir, Smith Reservoir, Kendrick Lake, and Cottonwood Lake. Northeast of them lies Kountze Lake. In the northwestern part of the city, Lena Gulch both feeds and drains Maple Grove Reservoir. In the extreme southern part of the city lies Bowles Reservoir No. 1 and, just outside the city limits to the reservoir's northeast, Marston Lake.<ref name=GoogleMaps/>

At the [[2020 United States Census]], the town had a total area of {{convert|115.635|km2|acre|order=flip}}, including {{convert|3.040|km2|acre|order=flip}} of water.<ref name=2020_Census/>

As a suburb of Denver, Lakewood is part of both the greater Denver metropolitan area and the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]].<ref>{{cite web|title=OMB Bulletin No. 13-01 |date=February 28, 2013 |url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/bulletins/2013/b-13-01.pdf |access-date=March 4, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207113057/https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/bulletins/2013/b-13-01.pdf |via=[[NARA|National Archives]] |work=[[Office of Management and Budget]] |archive-date=February 7, 2017 }}</ref> It borders other communities on all sides, including [[Wheat Ridge, Colorado|Wheat Ridge]] to the north, [[Edgewater, Colorado|Edgewater]] to the northeast, [[Denver]] to the east and southeast, [[Dakota Ridge, Colorado|Dakota Ridge]] to the south, [[Morrison, Colorado|Morrison]] to the southwest, and [[Golden, Colorado|Golden]], [[West Pleasant View, Colorado|West Pleasant View]], [[East Pleasant View, Colorado|East Pleasant View]], and [[Applewood, Colorado|Applewood]] to the northwest.
