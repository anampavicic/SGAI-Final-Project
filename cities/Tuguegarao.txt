The popular version based on legend is the Ibanags' reply to the Spaniards when asked for the name of the place: '''''Tuggi gari yaw''''' ("this was cleared by fire").

The origin of the city's name is unknown, but historical evidence suggests it was originally a pre-colonial settlement called '''''Tubigarao'''''. In 1591, the place was listed as a Spanish [[encomienda]].

===Spanish colonial era===
Tuguegarao was founded on May 9, 1604, as a "mission-pueblo" with the new vicar Fray Tomas Villa, O.P. initiating the construction of a temporary church housing Sts. Peter and Paul as patron saints.

In the 1720s, Father Antonio Lobato, O.P. developed a layout of street network together with the construction of the cathedral. In 1839, the provincial capital was transferred to Tuguegarao from [[Lal-lo, Cagayan|Lal-lo]] as the Cagayan-Manila road opened which spurred socio-economic progress.<ref name="Tug Web" />

===American era===
The town was occupied by American troops on December 12, 1899. Drastic improvements in Tuguegarao were discerned over the course of provincial administrations—the first Provincial Capitol was completed in 1909, a town hall and public market were built, the provincial high school—[[Cagayan National High School|Cagayan High School]]—was founded in a former private residence, and the [[Cagayan State University|Cagayan Valley College of Arts & Trades]] was founded by American educator Claude Andrews.<ref name="Tug Web" />

===Japanese occupation===
During [[World War II]], the city and its airfield was bombed at the opening of the [[Pacific War]] on 8 December 1941.<ref name="castillet">{{cite book |last=de Rivera Castillet|first=Ed|title=Cagayan Province and her People |publisher=Community Publishers|orig-date=1960}}</ref> The city fell to the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] on 12 December 1941, as part of the [[Japanese invasion of Aparri]]. The General Headquarters of the 11th Infantry Regiment, [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]], [[USAFIP-NL]] was activated in 1942 and stationed in Tuguegarao. Following an escalation of fighting during the closing months of the war, the Japanese fled to the barrio of Capatan. Tuguegarao was liberated by Allied forces on 25 June 1945.<ref name="castillet"/>

===Postwar era===
Sitio Capatan was elevated into a barrio (or barangay) of Tuguegarao on April 3, 1959, by [[List of Philippine laws|Republic Act]] No. 2107.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra2107.html|title=An Act Creating the Barrio of Capatan in the Municipality of Tuguegarao, Province of Cagayan|publisher=LawPH.com|access-date=April 13, 2011}}</ref>

===Declaration as regional capital ===
In 1975, Tuguegarao was declared as the capital and seat of the regional government of Cagayan Valley (Region II) being the region's geographic center with adequate facilities and amenities needed by such. Multistory buildings were constructed in the poblacion greatly changing Tuguegarao's skyline in the 1980s and 1990s.

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
Tuguegarao became a [[Cities in the Philippines|component city]] by virtue of [[List of Philippine laws#1999 (8746–8758)|Republic Act 8755]] dated November 4, 1999,<ref>{{cite web |title=Republic Act No. 8755 - An Act Converting The Municipality of Tuguegarao, Cagayan Province into a Component City to be known as Tuguegarao City |url=https://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno8755.html |website=www.chanrobles.com |publisher=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |access-date=December 8, 2020 |date=November 4, 1999}}</ref> followed by a [[plebiscite]] held on December 18, 1999. [[Randolph Ting]] was the first mayor of the new city. On July 2, 2007, Ting's father, businessman and former municipal mayor Delfin Telan Ting, was elected as the city's second mayor. After the 25-year political dominance of the Tings, however, retired police general Jefferson Soriano won over re-electionist Delfin Ting in the [[2013 Philippine local elections|2013 local elections]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/nation/2013/05/18/943274/tuguegarao-city-ting-stronghold-has-new-mayor|title=Tuguegarao City, a Ting stronghold, has new mayor|author=Lagasca, Charlie|work=The Philippine Star}}</ref> However, Soriano's term was marked by multiple charges of corruption that saw him being [[Tuguegarao#Government#Controversy|reinstated several times over his nine years in office.]] Eventually, he was defeated by Maila Ting-Que, daughter of Delfin Ting, in his 4th reelection bid in the [[2022 Philippine local elections|2022 local elections]]. This made Ting-Que the first woman to be elected mayor of the city.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Manabat |first1=Joann |title=Tuguegarao City elects Maila Ting as first woman mayor |url=https://www.rappler.com/philippines/elections/results-local-polls-mayor-tuguegarao-city-2022/ |website=Rappler |publisher=Rappler |access-date=10 September 2024 |date=10 May 2022}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Buntun Bridge, Cagayan River top view (Tuguegarao, Cagayan; 04-28-2024).jpg|thumb|Tuguegarao City skyline viewed from neighboring town [[Solana, Cagayan|Solana]]. Shown in the background is the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre mountain range]] while the foreground features the [[Cagayan River]] and [[Buntun Bridge]].]]
Tuguegarao's location is in the southern portion of the province. The city is bordered by [[Iguig, Cagayan|Iguig]] to the north; to the west by the [[Cagayan River]] and [[Solana, Cagayan|Solana]]; [[Peñablanca, Cagayan|Peñablanca]] to the east; and to the south by [[Enrile, Cagayan|Enrile]] and [[San Pablo, Isabela]]. The river delta city is almost encapsulated by the [[Cagayan River]] in the western and southern side, which explains for its northward expansion, and the [[Pinacanauan River]], a tributary of [[Cagayan River]], in the eastern part. Small bodies of waters are found in the city, such as the Balzain Creek which spans the barangays of Caritan Sur and Balzain. Currently, the creek is continuously drying up due to [[eutrophication]] and the uncontrollable growth of water lilies.

Historically, the town was inhabited by Irayas and [[Itawes]] who lived and mainly relied on fishing, farming, hunting and livestock raising. In addition, ancient natives have ventured on weaving cloth and making of household and farm implements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dotregion2.com.ph/welcome/tuguegarao-city/|title=Tuguegarao City|publisher=Department of Tourism - Region 2}}</ref>

[[Cagayan]] is divided into [[Legislative districts of the Philippines#Representative districts|three congressional districts]], wherein the city is included in the Third District together with the other 6 southern municipalities.<ref name="cagayano.tripod.com">{{Cite web|url=http://cagayano.tripod.com/geography.html|title=Province of Cagayan Website :: GEOGRAPHY|website=cagayano.tripod.com}}</ref>

The city is located {{convert|481|km}} north of [[Manila]], which is an hour by plane and ten hours of land travel.<ref name="cagayano.tripod.com"/>

===Barangays===
Tuguegarao is politically subdivided and comprises into 49 [[barangay]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tuguegaraocity.gov.ph/barangays/|title=Barangays}}</ref> Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s while some have [[sitios]].

There are 31 barangays in the city that are considered urban (highlighted in '''bold''').

=== Religion ===
[[File:Abp. Ricardo Baccay,.jpg|thumb|[[Ricardo Baccay]], the incumbent Roman Catholic Archbishop of Tuguegarao]]

Due to a history of Spanish and other foreign missions, Christianity, in the form of Roman Catholicism, is the predominant religion in Tuguegarao.
The present [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tuguegarao]] was chiseled from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia|Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia]] formerly located in [[Lal-lo, Cagayan|Lal-lo (Nueva Segovia)]]. It was initially created as a diocese on April 10, 1910, and elevated as an Archdiocese by [[Pope Paul VI]] on September 21, 1974. It has jurisdiction over suffragan bishops of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bayombong|Bayombong]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ilagan|Ilagan]] and [[Roman Catholic Territorial Prelature of Batanes|Batanes]].

The seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese is at [[Tuguegarao Cathedral|St. Peter Metropolitan Cathedral]], one of the largest churches in the region.
{{clear left}}

There are also [[Protestants]], [[Baptist]], [[Church of Christ]], [[Adventists]], [[Born again (Christianity)|Born Again]] groups, [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and Philippine-based groups like the [[Iglesia Filipina Independiente]], [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] and [[Members Church of God International]] that accounts to the city's population. These religious organizations have their own temples and churches sparsely located in the city. Some are [[Islam]] where their mosque is found in Centro 10 (Riverside).

==Economy==

Within the past three decades, its economy gradually shifted from agriculture to trading, commerce and services. The shift was ushered by Tuguegarao's role as the Regional Government Center and Center of Commerce in Northern Luzon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://philippinescities.com/tuguegarao-city-cagayan/|title=Tuguegarao City History {{!}} Tourist Spots, Language and Festivals {{!}} Philippines Cities|language=en-US|access-date=March 20, 2019}}</ref> In early 2016, Tuguegarao City was named as one of the ten emerging cities in the 2015 Next Wave Cities report, conducted by [[Department of Information and Communications Technology|Department of Science and Technology - Information and Communications Technology Office (DOST-ICTO)]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nicp.org.ph/cities|title=NEXT WAVE CITIES IN THE PHILIPPINES|publisher=nicp.org.ph|access-date=March 11, 2019}}</ref>

Currently, Tuguegarao has two major public markets, namely, the Don Domingo Public Market — located in the upper part of Poblacion serving as the convergence of agricultural and aquatic products from neighboring towns and provinces — and the Tuguegarao City Commercial Center — formerly known as Mall of the Valley and is located at the Central Business District, receiving the highest daily foot traffic.

===Controversy===
On February 10, 2017, then Mayor Jefferson P. Soriano stepped down from office following an order from the [[Ombudsman of the Philippines|Ombudsman]] to dismiss him for grave misconduct, which stemmed from anomalous purchases made when he was still the comptroller of the [[Philippine National Police]]. Soriano voluntarily called the [[Department of the Interior and Local Government]] (DILG) to facilitate the turn over of the mayoralty office to then Vice Mayor Bienvenido de Guzman II.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/161069-tuguegarao-mayor-jefferson-soriano-steps-down|title=Tuguegarao mayor Soriano steps down to focus on court fight|work=Rappler|access-date=February 10, 2017}}</ref> After about seven months, following the order of the [[Court of Appeals of the Philippines|Court of Appeals Fourth Division]] (CA) for "immediate" reinstatement of Mayor Jefferson P.

A cultural icon of the Philippines with a unique design, Tuguegarao's [[Motorized tricycle (Philippines)|tricycles]] offer shared vehicle for hire services for small groups of passengers on a common route over short distances.

Tuguegarao also serves as a vital hub for local, regional and national transportation. Buses operate regional routes from Tuguegarao to [[Baggao]], [[Aparri]], [[Santiago, Isabela|Santiago]], [[Baguio]], and many neighboring cities, towns and municipalities. It also is an end-of-the-line stop for many coaches running inter-city and national routes mostly coming from [[Metro Manila]] such as GV Florida, Victory Liner, Dalin Bus Liner, Five Star, and First North Luzon Transit.

To the east side are UV Express vans that ply north and south towards [[Claveria, Cagayan|Claveria]], [[Santa Praxedes, Cagayan|Santa Praxedes]], [[Aparri]], [[Santa Ana, Cagayan|Santa Ana]], [[Alcala, Cagayan|Alcala]], [[Lasam]] and [[Abulug, Cagayan|Junction Luna, Abulug]] in [[Cagayan]], [[Santiago, Isabela|Santiago]], [[Roxas, Isabela|Roxas]], [[Ilagan]] and [[Cauayan, Isabela|Cauayan]] in [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]], [[Luna, Apayao|Luna]] and [[Kabugao]] in [[Apayao]].

====Main roads====
Regional transport in Tuguegarao is vulnerable given its lack of distribution of [[arterial road]]s and inadequate traffic engineering planning and discipline.

*The '''Buntun Highway-Luna Street''' network is a major four-lane road network of Tuguegarao that forms part of National Route 51 (N51). It is the only road that serves west-side traffic to Tuguegarao. It links Tuguegarao to the western side of the Cagayan River via the [[Buntun Bridge]], further towns from the west side most notably the municipalities of [[Solana, Cagayan|Solana]] and [[Enrile, Cagayan|Enrile]], the [[Philippine highway network]] and the Santiago-Tuguegarao Road.
*The '''Balzain Highway-Cagayan Valley Road''' is another major four-lane road network of Tuguegarao, part of Cagayan Valley Road that comes through Balzain and Carig, that forms part of the [[Pan-Philippine Highway|Asian Highway 26]] ([[File:Asian Highway 26 PH sign.svg|35px]]). It is the only road that serves north-bound traffic to Tuguegarao coming from the east side of the Cagayan River and most of [[Cagayan Valley]]. It also links Tuguegarao to surrounding municipalities, most notably [[Iguig]] and [[Peñablanca]]. These two main arterial networks serves as the backbone for the majority of Tuguegarao's internal and inter-regional transportation.
*The '''Tuguegarao City West Diversion Road''' is an {{convert|8.99|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} four-lane road under construction which starts from Barangay Carig traversing Barangays Linao, Atulayan, Bagay and Buntun, aiming to decongest the Tuguegarao highway and provide alternative routes to nearby municipalities like Solana. The road project is divided into four phases expected to be completed by 2022.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2018/11/06/p1-1b-tuguegarao-diversion-road-being-built/|title=P1.1B Tuguegarao diversion road being built|author=Iñigo, Liezle Basa|work=Manila Bulletin|access-date=November 9, 2018}}</ref>

Two of the top state universities are also in Tuguegarao City—the [[Cagayan State University|CSU Athena]] (Andrews Campus), and [[Cagayan State University|CSU Red Eagle]] (Carig Campus)—producing national topnotchers in board examinations. Both universities have their own administration and are separated from each other.

Vargas College, Maila Rosario College, Credo Domine College, City Technological Institute, Cagayan Metropolitan Institute of Technology, [[STI College]], [[AMA University|AMA Computer College]], and other educational institutions. Proposals have also been unveiled for the establishment of a [[National University (Philippines)|National University]] campus (possibly within the SM City complex), majorly owned and ran by [[SM Investments|SM Group]].

The [[Technical Education and Skills Development Authority]] (TESDA) was established through the enactment of the Technical Education and Skills Development Act of 1994, which encourages the full participation of and mobilize the industry, labor, local government units, and technical-vocational institutions in the skills development of the country's human resource. The TESDA complex and facilities are located in Carig Norte. Numerous technological and vocational institutes can also be found in the city.
