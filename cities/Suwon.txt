== History ==

=== Early history ===
The area now corresponding to Suwon has been inhabited since at latest the early Bronze Age. Artifacts from that period to the early Iron Age have been found in the area, and include objects such as pottery, sculpture, and arrowheads.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last1=최 |first1=운식 |last2=이 |first2=도남 |script-title=ko:수원시 (水原市) |trans-title=Suwon City |url=https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0031604 |access-date=2024-02-02 |website=[[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]] |publisher=[[Academy of Korean Studies]] |language=ko}}</ref> One location these materials have been found is at {{Ill|Yeogisan|ko|여기산}}, which is now a {{Ill|Monuments of Gyeonggi Province|lt=monument of Gyeonggi Province|ko|경기도의 기념물}}.<ref name=":0" />

It became part of [[Goryeo]] after a military campaign led by King [[Taejo of Goryeo|Taejo]].<ref name=":0" /> In the 13th and 14th centuries, the area was promoted, demoted, merged, and made part of various administrative districts. The area then became a part of [[Joseon]] upon its founding, and in 1395 was made an administrative center of [[Gyeonggi Province]].<ref name=":0" />

==Geography==
Suwon lies in the north of the Gyeonggi plain, {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the national capital, Seoul. It is bordered by the cities of [[Uiwang]] to the north-west, [[Yongin]] to the east, [[Hwaseong City|Hwaseong]] to the south-west, and [[Ansan]] to the west.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://english.gg.go.kr/31-si-gun-shortcut/ |title=31 City/County Map |website=Gyeonggi-do Provincial Council |access-date=1 February 2024 |language=en}}</ref> Suwon is near the [[Yellow Sea]] coast: at its closest point, on the {{convert|239|m|ft|adj=on}} [[Chilbosan (Gyeonggi)|Chilbosan]] ridge to the west, Suwon lies {{convert|18.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Ueumdo<ref name="CoastDistanceFreeMapTools">{{cite web |url=https://www.freemaptools.com/measure-distance.htm |title=Measure distance on a map |website=Free Map Tools |language=en |access-date=1 February 2024}}</ref> in Sihwa Lake, a coastal inlet cordoned off to drive the [[Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station|world's largest tidal power station]].<ref name="Chilbosan">{{cite news |url=http://www.ebanwol.net/people/article_detail.asp?idx=10268 |script-title=ko:사사동의 칠부산 |trans-title=Sasa-dong's Chilbosan |newspaper=Banwol Newspaper |access-date=7 August 2007 |language=ko |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013090154/http://www.ebanwol.net/people/article_detail.asp?idx=10268 |archive-date=13 October 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Geology and topography===
Suwon is primarily composed of [[Precambrian]] metamorphic rock. It has [[amphibolite]]s that intrude through these, and also granites from the [[Mesozoic]] Era.<ref name="GeologyOverview">{{cite web |url=https://data.kigam.re.kr/data/RP-26041 |script-title=ko:水原 地質圖幅說明書 (수원 지질도폭설명서) |trans-title=Suwon Geological Map Manual |last=Oh |first=Inseop |date=1972 |publisher=Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources |access-date=11 May 2023 |language=ko |archive-date=26 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326084402/https://data.kigam.re.kr/data/RP-26041 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Most of Suwon is composed of biotite granite (Jbgr) from the [[Jurassic]] period. This granite is centred on Paldalsan. A form of Daebo granite, this rock is distributed through Homaesil-dong, Geumgok-dong, Dangsu-dong, Seryu-dong, Seodun-dong, Gwonseon-dong, and other areas. Its main constituent minerals are quartz, [[plagioclase]], orthotic, biotite, and amphibole.<ref name="GeologyOverview"/>

Precambrian biotite gneiss (PCEbgn) is found in northern Suwon, specifically Pajang-dong, Gwanggyo-dong, Woncheon-dong, and Maetan-dong. Visible rocks here are composed of [[quartz]], [[feldspar]], [[biotite]], [[amphibole]], and [[muscovite]]; and are generally dark grey or dark green. Mesozoic biotite granite intrudes through these.<ref name="GeologyOverview"/>

Precambrian quartzo-feldspathic gneiss (PCEqgn) is distributed in some mountainous areas in Hagwanggyo-dong and Sanggwanggyo-dong in northern Suwon. This gneiss has primarily undergone [[silicification]], and is mainly composed of quartz, feldspar, biotite, and muscovite. It is grey, grey-brown, and white.<ref name="GeologyOverview"/>

Suwon's single tectonic fault splits from the Singal Fault in Iui-dong, creating the Woncheonri Stream. The stream follows the fault through Ha-dong, Woncheon-dong, and Maetan-dong till it joins the Hwangguji Stream in Annyeong-dong, [[Hwaseong]]. This is a {{nobr|20 km}}-long vertical fault running SSW, eventually to the Yellow Sea. In Suwon, biotite gneiss and biotite granite are brought into contact by the fault.<ref name="GeologyOverview"/>

While the low-lying fault sits in the south of Suwon, the north is hillier: the city's highest point is [[Gwanggyosan]] ({{convert|582|m|ft|abbr=on}}) on the border with Yongin.<ref name="Gwanggyosan">{{cite web |url=http://www.koreasanha.net/san/gwanggyo.htm |script-title=ko:광교산 (光橋山) |trans-title=Gwanggyosan |work=Korean Mountaineering Association |language=ko |date=1999 |access-date=1 February 2024 |archive-date=6 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906175909/http://www.koreasanha.net/san/gwanggyo.htm |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Streams and lakes===
Most of Suwon's streams originate on Gwanggyosan or other nearby peaks. Since the city is bounded to the north by Gwanggyosan, to the west by Chilbosan, and to the east by other hills, the streams, chiefly the Hwanggujicheon, [[Suwoncheon]], [[Seohocheon]], and Woncheollicheon, flow southwards.<ref name="Streams">{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=Jinsun |last2=Lee |first2=Jimin |last3=Park |first3=Minji |last4=Min |first4=Joong-Hyuk |last5=Lee |first5=Jong Mun |last6=Jang |first6=Heeseon |last7=Na |first7=Eun Hye |year=2024 |title=The Impact of Non-Point Source (NPS) Management on Non-Point Source Reduction and Water Cycle Improvement in an Urban Area |journal=Sustainability |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=1248 |doi=10.3390/su16031248 |doi-access=free }}</ref> After merging, they eventually empty into the Yellow Sea at [[Asan Bay]].

[[File:Suwon Local Areas Map.PNG|thumb|alt=|Districts of Suwon]]

The city is composed of four ''[[Administrative divisions of South Korea#Gu (District)|gu]]'' (districts).<ref name="Suwon Statistics" /> [[Jangan District]] ({{Korean|hangul=장안구|labels=no}}) and [[Gwonseon District]] ({{Korean|hangul=권선구|labels=no}}) were established on {{nobr|1 July}} 1988. On {{nobr|1 February}} 1993, parts of Jangan District and Gwonseon District became a new district, [[Paldal District]] ({{Korean|hangul=팔달구|labels=no}}). The newest district is [[Yeongtong District]] ({{Korean|hangul=영통구|labels=no}}), which separated from Paldal District on {{nobr|24 November}} 2003. These districts are in turn divided into 42 ''[[Dong (administrative division)|dong]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.suwon.go.kr/sw-www/www05/www05-01/www05-01-08.jsp |script-title=ko:수원시 행정구역 |trans-title=Suwon Administrative Divisions |publisher=Suwon Council |access-date=7 June 2023 |language=ko |archive-date=1 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001134817/http://www.suwon.go.kr/sw-www/www05/www05-01/www05-01-08.jsp |url-status=live}}</ref>

These include [[Sungkyunkwan University]]'s Natural Sciences Campus, [[Kyonggi University]], [[Ajou University]], [[Dongnam Health University]], [[Gukje Cyber University]], [[Hapdong Theological Seminary]], and Suwon Women's University.
