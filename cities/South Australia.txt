'''South Australia''' (commonly abbreviated as '''SA''') is a [[States and territories of Australia|state]] in the southern central part of [[Australia]]. With a total land area of {{convert|984321|km2|sqmi|0}},<ref>[https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/national-location-information/dimensions/area-of-australia-states-and-territories Area of Australia - States and Territories] Geoscience Australia.

This population is the second-most highly centralised in the nation after [[Western Australia]], with more than 77% of South Australians living in the capital [[Adelaide]] or its environs. Other population centres in the state are relatively small; [[Mount Gambier]], the second-largest centre, has a population of 26,878.<ref>{{Cite web |title=2021 Mount Gambier, Census All persons QuickStats {{!}} Australian Bureau of Statistics |url=https://abs.gov.au/census/find-census-data/quickstats/2021/LGA44620 |access-date=2024-01-01 |website=abs.gov.au}}</ref>

South Australia shares borders with all the other mainland states. It is bordered to the west by [[Western Australia]], to the north by the [[Northern Territory]], to the north-east by [[Queensland]], to the east by [[New South Wales]], to the south-east by [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]], and to the south by the [[Great Australian Bight]].<ref name="SouthernOcean">Most Australians describe the body of water south of the continent as the [[Southern Ocean]], rather than the [[Indian Ocean]] as officially defined by the [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO).

The majority of its people reside in greater Metropolitan Adelaide. Most of the remainder are settled in fertile areas along the south-eastern coast and [[Murray River|River Murray]].

As with the rest of the continent, the region has a long history of [[Aboriginal Australians|human occupation]] by numerous tribes and languages. The [[South Australian Company]] established a temporary settlement at [[Kingscote, South Australia|Kingscote]], [[Kangaroo Island]], on 26 July 1836, five months before Adelaide was founded.<ref name="Kangaroo Island">{{cite web |url=http://www.kangarooisland.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm |title=Kangaroo Island Council – Welcome |publisher=[[Kangaroo Island Council]] |access-date=10 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809121105/http://www.kangarooisland.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm |archive-date=9 August 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The guiding principle behind settlement was that of ''systematic colonisation'', a theory espoused by [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]] that was later employed by the [[New Zealand Company]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Wakefield Model of Systematic Colonisation in South Australia|work=[[University of South Australia]]|date=2008|url=http://search.ror.unisa.edu.au/record/UNISA_ALMA2171701690001831/media/digital/open/9915951887301831/12146718360001831/13146717500001831/pdf}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The goal was to establish the province as a centre of civilisation for free immigrants, promising civil liberties and religious tolerance. Although its history has been marked by periods of economic hardship, South Australia has remained politically innovative and culturally vibrant. Today, it is known for its fine wine and numerous cultural festivals. The state's economy is dominated by the agricultural, manufacturing and mining industries.

{{Main|History of South Australia}}
[[File:Alexander Schramm - A scene in South Australia - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|left|European settlers with Aboriginal Australians, 1850]]

Evidence of human activity in South Australia dates back as far as 20,000 years, with [[flint]] mining activity and rock art in the [[Koonalda Cave]] on the [[Nullarbor Plain]]. In addition wooden spears and tools were made in an area now covered in [[peat]] [[bog]] in the South East. [[Kangaroo Island]] was inhabited long before the island was cut off by [[Sea level rise|rising sea levels]].<ref>R.J. Lampert (1979): Aborigines.

The first recorded European sighting of the South Australian coast was in 1627 when the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] ship the ''Gulden Zeepaert'', captained by [[François Thijssen]], examined and mapped a section of the coastline as far east as the [[Nuyts Archipelago]]. Thijssen named the whole of the country eastward of the Leeuwin "Nuyts Land", after a distinguished passenger on board; the Hon. [[Pieter Nuyts]], one of the [[Governor of Formosa|Councillors of India]].<ref>{{Citation

The coastline of South Australia was first mapped by [[Matthew Flinders]] and [[Nicolas Baudin]] in 1802, excepting the inlet later named the [[Port River|Port Adelaide River]] which was first discovered in 1831 by Captain [[Collet Barker]] and later accurately charted in 1836–37 by Colonel [[William Light]], leader of the South Australian Colonization Commissioners' 'First Expedition' and first Surveyor-General of South Australia.

The land which now forms the state of South Australia was claimed for Britain in 1788 as part of the colony of [[New South Wales]]. Although the new colony included almost two-thirds of the continent, early settlements were all on the eastern coast and only a few intrepid explorers ventured this far west. It took more than forty years before any serious proposal to establish settlements in the south-western portion of New South Wales were put forward.

On 15 August 1834, the [[British Parliament]] passed the [[South Australia Act 1834]] (''Foundation Act''), which empowered His Majesty to erect and establish a province or provinces in southern Australia. The act stated that the land between 132° and 141° east longitude and from 26° south latitude to the southern ocean would be allotted to the intended colony, and it would be convict-free.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/resources/transcripts/sa1_doc_1834.pdf |title=Transcript of the South Australia Act, 1834 |publisher=Museum of Australian Democracy at Old Parliament House|access-date=27 December 2018}}</ref>

In contrast to the rest of Australia, ''[[terra nullius]]'' did not apply to the new province. The [[Letters Patent]],<ref name="Letters Patent establishing the Province of South Australia 19 February 1836 (UK)">{{Cite web | url=https://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-38.html | title=Documenting Democracy}}</ref> which used the enabling provisions of the South Australia Act 1834 to fix the boundaries of the Province of South Australia, provided that "nothing in those our Letters Patent shall affect or be construed to affect the rights of any Aboriginal Natives of the said Province to the actual occupation and enjoyment in their own Persons or in the Persons of their Descendants of any Lands therein now actually occupied or enjoyed by such Natives."<ref name="Letters Patent establishing the Province of South Australia 19 February 1836 (UK)"/> Although the patent guaranteed land rights under force of law for the indigenous inhabitants, it was ignored by the South Australian Company authorities and squatters.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Ngadjuri Walpa Juri Lands and Heritage Association | date = n.d. | title = Gnadjuri | publisher=SASOSE Council Inc | isbn = 978-0-646-42821-5 }}</ref> Despite strong reference to the rights of the native population in the initial proclamation by the Governor, there were many conflicts and deaths in the [[Australian frontier wars|Australian Frontier Wars]] in South Australia.
[[File:Nicolas Baudin 2.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|[[Nicolas Baudin]], who mapped the coastline of South Australia, along with [[Matthew Flinders]]]]

Survey was required before settlement of the province, and the Colonization Commissioners for South Australia appointed William Light as the leader of its 'First Expedition', tasked with examining 1500 miles of the South Australian coastline and selecting the best site for the capital, and with then planning and surveying the site of the city into one-acre Town Sections and its surrounds into 134-acre Country Sections.

Eager to commence the establishment of their whale and seal fisheries, the South Australian Company sought, and obtained, the Commissioners' permission to send Company ships to South Australia, in advance of the surveys and ahead of the Commissioners' colonists.

The company's settlement of seven vessels and 636 people was temporarily made at Kingscote on Kangaroo Island, until the official site of the capital was selected by William Light, where the City of Adelaide is currently located. The first [[Immigration to Australia|immigrants]] arrived at [[Holdfast Bay]] (near the present day [[Glenelg, South Australia|Glenelg]]) in November 1836.

The commencement of colonial government was proclaimed on 28 December 1836, now known as [[Proclamation Day (South Australia)|Proclamation Day]].

South Australia is the only Australian state to have never received British convicts. Another free settlement, [[Swan River colony]] was established in 1829 but [[Western Australia]] later sought convict labour, and in 1849 Western Australia was formally constituted as a penal colony. Although South Australia was constituted such that convicts could never be transported to the Province, some emancipated or escaped convicts or expirees made their own way there, both prior to 1836, or later, and may have constituted 1–2% of the early population.<ref>Sendziuk, P.

Wakefield Press. {{ISBN|978 1 74305 119 1}}</ref>

The plan for the province was that it would be an experiment in reform, addressing the problems perceived in British society. There was to be religious freedom and no established religion. Sales of land to colonists created an Emigration Fund to pay the costs of transferring a poor young labouring population to South Australia. In early 1838 the colonists became concerned after it was reported that convicts who had escaped from the eastern states may make their way to South Australia. The [[South Australia Police]] was formed in April 1838 to protect the community and enforce government regulations. Their principal role was to run the first temporary gaol, a two-room hut.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/adelaidegaol/free-settlement.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024014707/http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/adelaidegaol/free-settlement.html|url-status=dead|title=History of Adelaide Gaol|archive-date=24 October 2009|access-date=19 November 2020}}</ref>

The current [[flag of South Australia]] was adopted on 13 January 1904, and is a British blue ensign [[Defacement (flag)|defaced]] with the state badge. The badge is described as a [[piping shrike]] with wings outstretched on a yellow disc. The state badge is believed to have been designed by Robert Craig of Adelaide's [[School of Design (Adelaide)|School of Design]].

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of South Australia}}
[[File:Eastern South Australia Satellite Photo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|A satellite image of eastern South Australia. Note the dry lakes (white patches) in the north.]]

The terrain consists largely of arid and semi-arid rangelands, with several low [[mountain range]]s. The most important (but not tallest) is the [[Mount Lofty Ranges|Mount Lofty]]-[[Flinders Ranges]] system, which extends north about {{convert|800|km|mi}} from [[Cape Jervis (headland)|Cape Jervis]] to the northern end of [[Lake Torrens]]. The highest point in the state is not in those ranges; [[Mount Woodroffe]] ({{convert|1435|m|ft|0}}) is in the [[Musgrave Ranges]] in the extreme northwest of the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ga.gov.au/education/facts/landforms/highmtns.htm#state |title=Highest Mountains |publisher=[[Geoscience Australia]] |access-date=28 May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421195512/http://www.ga.gov.au/education/facts/landforms/highmtns.htm#state |archive-date = 21 April 2006}}</ref>

The south-western portion of the state consists of the sparsely inhabited [[Nullarbor Plain]], fronted by the cliffs of the [[Great Australian Bight]]. Features of the coast include [[Spencer Gulf]] and the [[Eyre Yorke Block|Eyre and Yorke Peninsulas]] that surround it. The [[Temperate Grassland of South Australia]] is situated to the east of [[Gulf St Vincent]].

===South Australian boundaries===
{{Further|South Australian borders}}

South Australia has boundaries with every other Australian mainland state and territory except the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and the [[Jervis Bay Territory]].<!-- There are MANY territories that SA does NOT have a border with. --> The [[Western Australia border]] has a history involving the South Australian government astronomer, G.F. Dodwell, and the [[Western Australian Government Astronomer]], [[Harold Curlewis|H.B. Curlewis]], marking the border on the ground in the 1920s.

In 1863, that part of New South Wales to the north of South Australia was annexed to South Australia, by letters patent, as the "Northern Territory of South Australia", which became shortened to the Northern Territory on [[Territorial evolution of Australia#6 July 1863|6 July 1863]].<ref>[[Territorial evolution of Australia#6 July 1863|Territorial evolution of Australia – 6 July 1863]]</ref> The Northern Territory was handed to the federal government in 1911 and became a separate territory.

According to Australian maps, South Australia's south coast is flanked by the [[Southern Ocean]], but official international consensus defines the Southern Ocean as extending north from the pole only to 60°S or 55°S, at least 17 degrees of latitude further south than the most southern point of South Australia. Thus the south coast is officially adjacent to the south-most portion of the Indian Ocean. ''See [[Southern Ocean#Existence and definitions|Southern Ocean: Existence and definitions]]''.

South Australia's [[credit rating]] was upgraded to AAA by [[Standard & Poor's]] in September 2004 and to AAA by [[Moody's]] in November 2004, the highest credit ratings achievable by any company or sovereign. The state had previously lost these ratings in the State Bank collapse. However, in 2012 Standard & Poor's downgraded the state's credit rating to AA+ due to declining revenues, new spending initiatives and a weaker than expected budgetary outlook.<ref name=pu12>{{cite news|last1=Puddy|first1=Rebecca|title=South Australia loses AAA rating in credit rating downgrade|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/state-politics/return-to-surplus-deferred-in-lean-south-australian-budget/story-e6frgczx-1226377225636|access-date=1 September 2015|newspaper=The Australian|date=31 May 2012}}</ref>

==Government==
{{Main|Government of South Australia}}
[[File:Parliament House, South Australia.jpg|upright=1.15|right|thumb|[[Parliament House, Adelaide]]]]

South Australia is a [[constitutional monarchy]] with King  [[Charles III]] as sovereign, and the [[Governor of South Australia]] as his
representative.<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|31|1907|litigants=[[R v Governor of South Australia; Ex parte Vardon]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1907/31.pdf (1907)&nbsp;4&nbsp;CLR&nbsp;1497] |courtname=auto}}.</ref> It is a state of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]]. The [[bicameral]] [[Parliament of South Australia]] consists of the [[lower house]] known as the [[South Australian House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] and the [[upper house]] known as the [[South Australian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]]. [[South Australian state elections|General elections]] are held every four years, the last being the [[2022 South Australian state election|2022 election]].

Initially, the [[Governor of South Australia]] held almost total power, derived from the letters patent of the imperial government to create the colony. He was accountable only to the British [[Colonial Office]], and thus democracy did not exist in the colony. A new body was created to advise the governor on the administration of South Australia in 1843 called the Legislative Council.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.sa.gov.au/about/1_1_1_legcouncil.shtm |title=Legislative Council 1843–1856 |access-date=28 May 2006 |publisher=[[Parliament of South Australia]] |year=2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825143657/http://www.parliament.sa.gov.au/about/1_1_1_legcouncil.shtm |archive-date=25 August 2006 }}</ref> It consisted of three representatives of the British Government and four colonists appointed by the governor. The governor retained total executive power.

In 1851, the Imperial Parliament enacted the [[Australian Colonies Government Act]], which allowed for the election of representatives to each of the colonial legislatures and the drafting of a constitution to properly create representative and responsible government in South Australia. Later that year, propertied male colonists were allowed to vote for 16 members on a new 24 seat Legislative Council. Eight members continued to be appointed by the governor.

[[File:Old Parliament House Adelaide 1872.jpg|thumb|left|Old Parliament House in 1872]]
The main responsibility of this body was to draft a constitution for South Australia. The body drafted the most democratic constitution ever seen in the British Empire and provided for universal manhood [[suffrage]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Change name |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/australian_electoral_history/righttovote.htm |title=The Right to Vote in Australia |publisher=Australian Electoral Commission |date=28 January 2011 |access-date=17 July 2016}}</ref> It created the bicameral [[Parliament of South Australia]]. For the first time in the colony, the executive was elected by the people, and the colony used the [[Westminster system]], where the government is the party or coalition that exerts a majority in the House of Assembly. The Legislative Council remained a predominantly conservative chamber elected by property owners.

[[Women's suffrage in Australia]] took a leap forward – [[Constitutional Amendment (Adult Suffrage) Act 1894|enacted in 1895]] and taking effect from the [[1896 South Australian colonial election|1896 colonial election]], South Australia was the first government in Australia and only the second in the world after [[New Zealand]] to allow women to vote, and the first in the world to allow women to stand for election.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.parliament.sa.gov.au/education/teachers/Documents/Women's%20Petition%20Photograph.pdf |title=Women's Suffrage Petition 1894: parliament.sa.gov.au |access-date=17 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110329160732/http://www.parliament.sa.gov.au/education/teachers/Documents/Women%27s%20Petition%20Photograph.pdf |archive-date=29 March 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1897 [[Catherine Helen Spence]] was the first woman in Australia to be a candidate for political office when she was nominated to be one of South Australia's delegates to the conventions that drafted the constitution. South Australia became an original state of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901.

Although the lower house had universal suffrage, the upper house, the Legislative Council, remained the exclusive domain of property owners until the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government of [[Don Dunstan]] managed to achieve reform of the chamber in 1973. Property qualifications were removed and the Council became a body elected via [[proportional representation]] by a single state-wide electorate.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dunstan |first=Don |year=1981 |title=Felicia: The political memoirs of Don Dunstan |publisher=Griffin Press Limited |pages=214–215 |isbn=0-333-33815-4}}</ref>
Since the following [[1975 South Australian state election]], no one party has had control of the state's upper house with the balance of power controlled by a variety of minor parties and independents.

There are three public and four private universities in South Australia. The three public universities are the [[University of Adelaide]] (established 1874, third oldest in Australia), [[Flinders University]] (est. 1966) and the [[University of South Australia]] (est. 1991). The four private universities are [[Torrens University Australia]] (est. 2013), [[Carnegie Mellon University - Australia]] (est. 2006), [[University College London]]'s School of Energy and Resources (Australia), and [[Cranfield University]]. All six have their main campus in the Adelaide metropolitan area: Adelaide and UniSA on [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]] in the [[Adelaide city centre|city]]; CMU, UCL and Cranfield are co-located on [[Victoria Square, Adelaide|Victoria Square]] in the city, and Flinders at [[Bedford Park, South Australia|Bedford Park]].

====Vocational education====
{{main|TAFE South Australia}}
Tertiary vocational education is provided by a range of Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) which are regulated at Commonwealth level. The range of RTOs delivering education include public, private and 'enterprise' providers i.e. employing organisations who run an RTO for their own employees or members.

The largest public provider of vocational education is [[TAFE South Australia]] which is made up of colleges throughout the state, many of these in rural areas, providing tertiary education to as many people as possible. In South Australia, TAFE is funded by the [[Government of South Australia|state government]] and run by the South Australian [[Department of Further Education, Employment, Science and Technology]] (DFEEST). Each TAFE SA campus provides a range of courses with its own specialisation.

==Transport==

[[File:SouthAustraliaRoads.png|thumb|Major highways in South Australia]]

===Historical transport in South Australia===
After settlement, the major form of transport in South Australia was ocean transport. Limited land transport was provided by horses and bullocks. In the mid 19th century, the state began to develop a widespread rail network, although a coastal shipping network continued until the post war period.

Roads began to improve with the introduction of motor transport. By the late 19th century, road transport dominated internal transport in South Australia.

===Railway===
South Australia has four interstate rail connections, to [[Perth]] via the Nullarbor Plain, to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] through the centre of the continent, to New South Wales through [[Broken Hill]], and to [[Melbourne]]–which is the closest capital city to Adelaide.

Rail transport was important for many mines in the north of the state.

The capital Adelaide has a commuter rail network made of electric and diesel electric powered multiple units, with 7 lines between them.

===Roads===
[[File:Nullarbor warning signs, 2012.jpg|thumb|[[Eyre Highway]] west of the [[Nullarbor, South Australia]]]]
South Australia has extensive road networks linking towns and other states. Roads are also the most common form of transport within the major metropolitan areas with car transport predominating. Public [[transport in Adelaide]] is mostly provided by buses and trams with regular services throughout the day.

===Air transport===
[[Adelaide Airport]] provides regular flights to other capitals, major South Australian towns and many international locations. The airport also has daily flights to several Asian hub airports. Adelaide Metro<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adelaidemetro.com.au/timetables/buses|title=Adelaide Metro|date=12 February 2020|publisher=Service SA|access-date=19 November 2020|work=adelaidemetro.com.au}}</ref> buses J1 and J1X connect to the city (approx. 30 minutes travel time), as well as other services to other parts of Adelaide. Standard fares apply and tickets may be purchased from a ticket machine at the airport bus stop. Maximum charge (September 2016) for Metroticket is $5.30; off-peak and seniors discounts may apply.
[[File:Waikerie ferry, Riverland 1.JPG|thumb|A ferry crossing the Murray River towards the town of [[Waikerie, South Australia]]]]

===River transport===
The [[River Murray]] was formerly an important trade route for South Australia, with [[River Murray Navigation Co.#Steaming on the Murray River|paddle steamers]] linking inland areas and the ocean at Goolwa.

===Sea transport===
South Australia has a container port at [[Port Adelaide]]. There are also numerous important ports along the coast for minerals and grains.

The passenger terminal at Port Adelaide periodically sees cruise liners.

Kangaroo Island is dependent on the Sea Link ferry service between [[Cape Jervis (headland)|Cape Jervis]] and [[Penneshaw]].

[[Diana Laidlaw]] did much to further the arts in South Australia during her term as Arts Minister from 1993 to 2002, and after [[Mike Rann]] assumed government in 2002, he created a strategic plan in 2004 (updated 2007) which included furthering and promoting the arts in South Australia under the topic heading "Objective 4:

===Rugby league===
{{main|Rugby league in South Australia}}
The state [[rugby league]] federation is the [[South Australian Rugby League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sarl.leaguenet.com.au/|title=LeagueNet - South Australian Rugby League|access-date=3 December 2023|archive-date=9 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909060911/http://sarl.leaguenet.com.au/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The game traces its roots in the state back to the 1940s, when the Port Adelaide [[rugby union]] team split in four, and defected to [[rugby league]].

South Australia's only professional rugby league team, the [[Adelaide Rams]], had a short but eventful existence. After debuting in the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] competition in [[1997 Super League (Australia) season|1997]], in [[National Rugby League season 1998|1998]] they were selected to join the 20-team [[National Rugby League]]; however they were to be axed from the 1999 season as part of a rationalisation of teams (from 20 to 14) in the competition.

At present however, the [[South Australian Rugby League]] still operates a local semi-professional competition consisting of both junior and adult teams from across Adelaide.

[[Adelaide Oval]] hosted [[State of Origin series]] games in both [[2020 State of Origin series|2020]] and [[2023 State of Origin series|2023]], with the latter drawing a state record rugby league attendance of 48,613.
