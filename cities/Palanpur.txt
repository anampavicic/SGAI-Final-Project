'''Palanpur''' ([[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]: {{IAST|Pālanpur}}) is a city and a headquarters of [[Banaskantha district]] in the [[Indian state]] of [[Gujarat]]. Palanpur is the ancestral home to an industry of Indian diamond merchants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theconversation.com/the-rise-and-rise-of-belgiums-indian-diamond-dynasties-32332 |title = The rise and rise of Belgium's Indian diamond dynasties| date=16 October 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.rediff.com/business/special/how-palanpurs-diamond-merchants-conquered-the-world/20200207.htm| title = How Palanpur's diamond merchants conquered the world - Rediff.com}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Palanpur in early times is said to have been called Prahladana Patan or Prahaladanapura after its founder Prahladana, mentioned in Jain texts. It was afterwards re-peopled by Palansi Chauhan from whom it took its modern name. Others say that it was founded by Pal Parmar whose brother Jagadev founded nearby Jagana village.<ref name=gbp>{{cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dLUBAAAAYAAJ|year=1880| ref={{sfnref | Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha | 2015}}|publisher=Government Central Press| pages=318–324}}</ref>

According to [[Hasmukh Dhirajlal Sankalia]], the name ''Pālanpur'' is derived from ''Pālhaṇapura'', mentioned in a [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chaulukya]]-era inscription.<ref name="Sankalia 1949">{{cite book |last1=Sankalia |first1=Hasmukh Dhirajlal |author-link=Hasmukh Dhirajlal Sankalia |title=Studies in the Historical and Cultural Geography and Ethnography of Gujarat |date=1949 |publisher=Deccan College |location=Pune |url=https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.16229 |access-date=14 July 2023}}</ref>{{rp|71–2}}

[[File:Jorawar Palce Aerial View Palanpur Gujarat 1936.jpg|thumb|left|An aerial view of Jorawar Palace, 1936]]
The Jain texts mentions that Prahladana, brother of [[Paramaras of Chandravati|Paramara]] Dharavarsha of Abu, founded Prahladanapur in 1218 and built Prahladana-vihara dedicated to Pallaviya Parshwanatha.<ref name="Dhaky1961">{{cite journal|first=Madhusudan A.|last=Dhaky|author-link=Madhusudan Dhaky|year=1961|editor-last=Deva|editor-first=Krishna|title=The Chronology of the Solanki Temples of Gujarat|url=http://vmis.in/Resources/digital_publication_popup?id=136#page/68|journal=Journal of the Madhya Pradesh Itihas Parishad|publisher=Madhya Pradesh Itihas Parishad|publication-place=[[Bhopal]]|volume=3|pages=81}}</ref> The town was re-peopled ruled by [[Chahamanas of Naddula|Chauhans]] around thirteenth century. At the start of the seventeenth century, the [[Palanpur State]] was taken over by Jhalori dynasty of the [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] [[Lohani]] tribe which was founded in 1373 and ruled from [[Jalore]] (Rajasthan). The dynasty came into historical prominence during the period of instability that followed the demise of [[Mughal emperor]] [[Aurangzeb]] in the early 18th century. It was overrun soon afterwards by the [[Maratha]]s; the Lohanis followed the trend of seeking recourse in the [[British East India Company]] against them and finally entered the [[subsidiary alliance]] system in 1817, along with all other neighbouring states, becoming a [[British protectorate]].<ref name=gbp/> After [[independence of India]] in 1947, Palanpur State was dissolved in 1949 and merged with [[Dominion of India|Union of India]] as a part of [[Bombay State]]. Subsequently, Palanpur became the capital of [[Banaskantha district]] of [[Gujarat]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/ips/p/palanpur.html |title=Palanpur |access-date=10 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115013656/http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/ips/p/palanpur.html |archive-date=15 January 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1750 (Samvat 1806), Bahadur Khan built a brick and mortar city-wall, the ''Nagarkot'' of Palanpur. It was 3 miles round, 17 to 20 feet high and 6 feet broad with seven bastioned gateways, and, at the corners, round towers armed with guns. The gateways of the city-walls were Delhi Darwaja, Gathaman Darwaja, Malan Darwaja, Mira Darwaja, Virbai Darwaja, Salempura Darwaja, Sadarpur Darwaja or Shimla Darwaja. Only Mira Darwaja survives today.

Sher Muhammad Khan attended the coronation ceremony of [[King George V]] in Delhi in 1910 and built a club named after him in 1913. In 1918, his successor Tale Muhammad Khan constructed Kirti Stambh, a 22-metre tower near the railway station commemorating the gallantry of his father and the history of town and his dynasty.
