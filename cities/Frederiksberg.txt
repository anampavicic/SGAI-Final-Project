Frederiksberg is an [[enclave]] surrounded by [[Copenhagen Municipality]]. Some sources ambiguously refer to Frederiksberg as a [[Quarter (urban subdivision)|quarter]] or of Copenhagen,<ref name="visit">{{cite web|title=Guide to Frederiksberg in Copenhagen|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/culture/posh-frederiksberg|website=visitcopenhagen.com|publisher=Wonderful Copenhagen|access-date=16 April 2016|quote=Frederiksberg is a fashionable part of Copenhagen with excellent shopping opportunities and green spaces.|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413053101/http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/culture/posh-frederiksberg|archive-date=13 April 2016}}</ref> being one of the four municipalities in Copenhagen zone (the other three being [[Copenhagen Municipality|Copenhagen]], [[Tårnby Municipality|Tårnby]] and [[Dragør Municipality|Dragør]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Regioner, landsdele og kommuner. v 1.0: 2007-|url=http://www.dst.dk/da/Statistik/dokumentation/Nomenklaturer/NUTS|publisher=[[Statistics Denmark]]|access-date=6 June 2018}} See also: [[Provinces of Denmark]].</ref> However, Frederiksberg has its own mayor and municipal council, and is fiercely independent.

Frederiksberg is an [[affluent]] area,<ref name="visit" /> characterised by its many green spaces such as the [[Frederiksberg Gardens]], [[Søndermarken]], and [[Hostrups Have]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://copenhagenbydesign.com/hostrups-have/|title=Hostrups Have, Falkoner Allé|language=en|access-date=3 January 2019}}</ref> Some institutions and locations that are widely considered to be part of Copenhagen are actually located in Frederiksberg. For example, [[Copenhagen Zoo]] as well as several stations of the [[Copenhagen Metro]] (the stations ''Forum'', ''Frederiksberg'', ''Fasanvej'', ''Lindevang'', ''Flintholm'', ''Axel Møllers Have'', and ''Frederiksberg Allé'') are located in Frederiksberg. The [[S-train (Copenhagen)|Copenhagen S-train system]] also has several stations in Frederiksberg, including ''Peter Bangs Vej station'' and ''Flintholm station''.

The history of Frederiksberg goes back to 2 June 1651 when [[Frederick III of Denmark|King Frederik III]] gave 20 Danish-Dutch peasants the rights to settle at ''Allégade'' (from the words ''allé'' (tree-lined street) and ''gade'' (street)), and founded the town then named "''Ny Amager''" (New [[Amager]]) or "''Ny Hollænderby''" (New Dutchman-town). Farming was not very successful, and in 1697 most of the town burned down. This meant that the peasants were unable to pay [[tax]]es, and the land reverted to the crown by Frederik III's son [[Christian V]].

In 1700–1703, [[Frederick IV of Denmark|King Frederik IV]] built a [[palace]] on top of the hill known as [[Valby Bakke]] (''bakke'' = hill). He named the palace ''Frederichs Berg'', and the rebuilt town at the foot of the hill consequently changed its name to Frederiksberg. A number of the local houses were bought by wealthy citizens of Copenhagen who did not farm the land, but rather used the properties as country houses.

The town changed slowly from a farming community to a merchant town, with craftsmen and merchants. During the summer, rooms were offered for rent, and restaurants served food to the people of Copenhagen who had left the cramped city for the open land, and to be near the royals.

Initially the town grew slowly with population growing from 1,000 in 1770, to 1,200 in 1800, and to 3,000 in 1850.

In 1852, [[Parliament]] removed restrictions which prohibited permanent construction outside Copenhagen's city walls. Almost immediately numerous residential areas were constructed, starting in the eastern part near Copenhagen, and ending in the western part farthest away from Copenhagen in 1950. This led to rapid population growth; in 1900 the population reached 80,000, and in 1950 Frederiksberg peaked with a population of 120,000.

Today Frederiksberg consists almost entirely of 3- to 5-story residential houses, large single-family homes, and large parks; only a few small areas with light industry remain.

==Geography==
[[File:Kopenhagen-frederiksberg.PNG|thumb|Fredericksberg's location inside Copenhagen's municipality area]]
[[File:People in Frederiksberg Have, Copenhagen, Denmark.JPG|thumb|180px|Frederiksberg Have]]
[[File:Frederiksberg Allé - parking lanes.jpg|thumb|180px|Frederiksberg Allé]]
Frederiksberg, which lies west of central [[Copenhagen]], is completely surrounded by boroughs forming part of the city of Copenhagen – the result of an expansion of the [[Copenhagen municipality|Copenhagen Municipality's]] boundary in 1901, which nevertheless did not include Frederiksberg in the list of municipalities to be incorporated in the enlarged area. Frederiksberg is thus effectively a municipal island within the country's capital – a unique phenomenon in present-day Europe. Other than administratively, however, it is largely indistinguishable in character from the districts of Copenhagen city which surround it.<ref name="visit" />

Frederiksberg has several stations on the [[Copenhagen Metro]] system, and is home to the tallest residential structure in Denmark and the second tallest residential building in [[Scandinavia]]: the 102-metre high [[Domus Vista]].

==Culture==
The [[Danmark Rundt]] cycling race traditionally finishes on Frederiksberg Alle, often in a sprint finish.

===Education===
Frederiksberg houses the University of Copenhagen's [[Frederiksberg Campus (University of Copenhagen)|Frederiksberg Campus]], [[Copenhagen Business School]], 9 public schools (run by the municipality), 3 private schools, 1 technical college, and more.

The ''[[Lycée Français Prins Henrik]]'', a French international school, is in Frederiksberg.<ref>[http://www.lfph.dk/?page_id=81 "Plan d’accès"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427124655/http://www.lfph.dk/?page_id=81 |date=2015-04-27 }}/[http://www.lfph.dk/?page_id=81&lang=dk Sådan finder du skolen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427111614/http://www.lfph.dk/?page_id=81&lang=dk |date=2015-04-27 }}.
