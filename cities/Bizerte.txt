===Later history===
[[Rashidun Caliphate|Arab]] armies took Bizerte in 647 in their first invasion of the area, but the city reverted to control from Constantinople until the Byzantines were defeated and finally driven from North Africa in 695‚Äì98. The troops of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] captured the city in 1535; the [[Conquest of Tunis (1574)|Turks took it in 1574]]. The city then became a [[Barbary Pirate|corsair]] harbour and struggled against the French and the Venetians.

With its occupation of Tunisia in 1881, [[French Third Republic|France]] gained control of Bizerte and built a large naval harbour in the city.

In 1924, after the French government officially recognized the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR), [[Wrangel's fleet|the western military fleet of White Russia]] that had been kept in the port of Bizerte was returned to the Soviet government. The ships were never moved from the port and finally were sold there as scrap metal.

In March 1939, towards the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]], [[Spanish Republican Navy]] Commander [[Miguel Buiza Fern√°ndez-Palacios|Miguel Buiza]] ordered the evacuation of the bulk of the Republican fleet. Three cruisers, eight destroyers and two submarines left [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] harbor and reached Bizerte, where the French authorities impounded them.<ref>{{cite book |author-link= Hugh Thomas (writer) |last= Thomas |first= Hugh |title= The Spanish Civil War
| publisher = [[Penguin Books]] |year= 2001 |location= London |page= 877}}</ref>

During the [[Second World War]], the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German]] and [[Royal Italian Army|Italian armies]] occupied Bizerte until [[Tunisian Campaign|Allied troops defeated them]] on 7 May 1943. During the fighting between the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] and the German Army, many of the city's inhabitants fled to the countryside or to [[Tunis]]. The city suffered significant damage during the battle.<ref>{{cite web

[[File:Vue a√©rienne de Bizerte - 1959.jpg|thumb|right|180px| Aerial view of Bizerte in 1959]]
Due to Bizerte's strategic location on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[French Fourth Republic|France]] retained control of the city and their naval base after Tunisian independence in 1956. 
In 1961 Tunisian forces [[Bizerte crisis|blockaded]] the area of Bizerte and demanded French withdrawal. The face-off escalated when a French helicopter took off and drew fire. The French brought in reinforcements; when these were fired upon, France took decisive military action against the Tunisian forces. Using superior weapons and decisive force the French took Bizerte and [[Menzel Bourguiba]]. During three days in July 1961, 700 Tunisians died (1200 wounded); the French lost 24 dead (100 wounded).<ref name="Nations">{{Cite book|last=Nations|first=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6bp1DwAAQBAJ&q=The+port+of+Bizerte&pg=PA95|title=Regional Conference on building a future for sustainable small-scale fisheries in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea|date=31 October 2018|publisher=Food & Agriculture Org.|isbn=978-92-5-130553-9|language=en}}</ref>

Meetings at the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] and other international pressure moved France to agreement; the French military finally abandoned Bizerte on 15 October 1963.<ref name="Nations"/>

==Geography==
<gallery mode="packed" heights=350px>
File:Circonscription de Bizerte.png|''Circonsciption of Bizerte.''
</gallery>

===Location===
Bizerte is on a section of widened inlet and east-facing coast of the north coast of Tunisia, 15 kilometres from [[Ras ben Sakka]] (the northernmost point in Africa on the [[Mediterranean Sea]]), 20 kilometers northeast of the [[Ichkeul lake]] (a World Heritage Site), {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} north of the archaeological site of [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and 65 kilometers north of [[Tunis]].

West of the city there are coastal hills forming an outcrop of the [[Tell Atlas]] with well-conserved woods and vantage points. Its associated beaches include Sidi Salem, La Grotte, Rasenjela, and Al Rimel. It is on a section of Mediterranean climate coastline, close to [[Sardinia]] and [[Sicily]], as opposed to coasts in the south of the country which have a year-round dry desert climate.

The city is centered on the north shore of the canal of Bizerte linking the Mediterranean Sea to a tidal lake, the [[Lac de Bizerte]] which is larger than all parts of the town combined, to the immediate south. Built-up areas are in three directions:
*South-west along the widening canal with jetties at Pecherie and Jarrouba, the latter associated with [[Bizerte-Sidi Ahmed Air Base]] adjoining the opening of the lake and military/rescue heliport.  
*North are Sidi Salam and Corniche. They are within meters of the coast and on coast-facing slopes of the Ain Berda, a range of hills toward Cap Blanc, a small headland in the Ain Damou Plage natural conservation area. 
*Zarzouna, [[Menzel Jemil]] and [[Menzel Abderrahmane]] are on the south shore of the canal, formed by the locality of Zarzouna and the towns of [[Menzel Jemil]] and [[Menzel Abderrahmane]], by a moveable bridge and both Menzels face the lake itself. The rest of the [[isthmus]] on which they stand is the gently rising Foret de Remel, reaching a high point east of its forest area at [[Cap Zebib]].

===Transport===
[[File:AutorouteA4Tunisie.JPG|thumb|right| [[A4 motorway (Tunisia)|A4 motorway]] connecting Bizerte and Tunis]]
The bridge leads to [[A4 motorway (Tunisia)|the motorway A4]] leading to [[Tunis‚ÄìCarthage International Airport]] and the capital. On the town side the P11 passes semi-rural Louata, hugs Ichkeul Lake and branches into a western route, the P7, leading directly to [[Tabarka]] on the coast next to the Algerian border. The P11 leads south-west to [[B√©ja]], a governorate center, in the foothills of the [[Tell Atlas]], forks into several roads at [[Bou Salem]], a small town in a broad fertile plain, and climbs to Firnanah passing two high-altitude lakes and also approaching the north-west border with Algeria.

===Climate===
Bizerte enjoys a [[Mediterranean climate#Hot-summer Mediterranean climate|hot-summer mediterranean]] climate, with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers. The Mediterranean Sea breeze makes summers cooler and more humid than in the interior of Tunisia.<ref name="Climate‚ÄìData.Eu">{{Cite web|url=http://www.climatedata.eu/climate.php?loc=tsxx0001&lang=en|title=Climate Bizerte ‚Äì Table|publisher=Climate‚ÄìData.Eu|access-date=20 July 2014|archive-date=27 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727171306/http://www.climatedata.eu/climate.php?loc=tsxx0001&lang=en|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Architecture and landscape ==
=== Vieux Port ===
Le vieux port (the old port) of Bizerte is a port with its small pool surrounded by white houses, cafes and large boats in bright colors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.voyage-tunisie.info/vieux-port-de-bizerte-tunisie/|title = Le vieux port de Bizerte, Tunisie|date = 8 December 2017}}</ref> The old port is the most charming place in Bizerte. The quay stretches in an arc along the Siena earth ramparts of the Kasbah and the low white houses. A modest boat painted in red and green slices through the calm water, a fisherman unloads his fish for the nearby market, another weighs anchor... Bizerte presents the familiar spectacle of a small Proven√ßal or Spanish port which would have traded its bell tower for a minaret. The old port of Bizerte comes alive particularly at the end of the day, when the terraces of the bistros invade the quays.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.voyage-tunisie.info/vieux-port-de-bizerte-tunisie/|title=Le vieux port de Bizerte, Tunisie|website=Voyage-tunisie.info|date=8 December 2017|access-date=11 June 2022}}</ref>

{{wide image|Bizerte banner.jpg|1200px|Vieux Port of Bizerte}}

=== Medina ===
[[File:Elmedina, Bizerte, Tunisia.jpg|thumb|left|The Medina of Bizerte.]]
The medina corresponds to the old town of Bizerte. It stretches north of the modern city, above Avenue Bourguiba, and runs along the old port to the Kasbah (the fortress). Once protected by a rampart facing inland, it was brought down during the French protectorate to assert its power over the city. The medina is a sort of labyrinth of narrow streets that intersect in all directions. In the souks, the smells change from one alley to another, according to the shops of craftsmen and their products. The names of the streets correspond to the old corporations present here: rue des armuriers, rue des carpenters, weavers, jewelers ... In narrow stalls you can see a craftsman at work. The tall octagonal-shaped minaret of the Great Mosque (dating from the 17th century) rises above the medina. At his side, the zaou√Øa of Sidi Mokhtar Dey, boss of Bizerte.

The Medina of Bizerte is an old town that surrounds the picturesque Old Port district. It is a bustling center of traditional crafts. In its winding labyrinth of narrow alleys and covered souks are the workshops of metalworkers and carpenters, and butchers and grocery stores. The streets are named after the artisans who live and work there: the blacksmiths on rue des Forgerons, the gunsmiths on rue des Armuriers, carpenters on rue des Menuisiers and butchers on rue des bouchers. It is a very atmospheric place to walk, and unlike the Medinas of Hammamet and Monastir, it has not been restored so it oozes with all the exotic charm of the Orient.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cityzeum.com/bizerte-la-medina|title=Bizerte-la m√©dina en Tunisie: guide, visite, infos, avis, prix, adresse, r√©server|website=Cityzeum.com|access-date=11 June 2022}}</ref>

=== Kasbah ===
[[File:Bizerte, Kasbah 02.jpg|thumb|right|View of The Kasbah of Bizerte.]]
The Kasbah is located in north of the old port, it has a single entrance from the West side. It has small dimensions: approximately 175m by 120m and has 8 towers and a walkway. It was built in the 17th century.
On the other side of the canal, the kasbah rises its ramparts above the medina: it is accessed for the beautiful view of the city, the port, the lake and the sea. The origins of this fortress go back to the time of the Byzantine occupation: rectangular in shape, a tower occupies each corner. The entrance to the kasbah is a narrow arched passageway designed to slow down any invaders attempting to enter it at the time. The interior of the fortress is a maze of small alleys lined with houses. At the foot of the north-west rampart, the market place comes alive with the cry of the merchants, and the stalls give the impression of an organized jumble. Beyond stretches the Andalusian quarter, where the Moors from Spain took refuge in the 17th century. Further along, linked by a rampart of the kasbah, we can see the silhouette of the fort of Spain, which overlooks Bizerte at an altitude of about 40 meters on a height to the north. This fort dates from 1573, built during the Turkish domination by the Pasha of Algiers. It is built so as to be able to face the artillery, composed of thirteen sides with re-entrant angles. Now far from any threat, the fort has since been redeveloped into an open-air theater, which notably hosts the Bizerte International Festival (music, dance, film).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://guide-voyage-tunisie.com/la-kasbah-de-bizerte|title=La Kasbah de Bizerte &#124; Guide de voyage en Tunisie|website=Guide-voyage-tunisie.com|access-date=11 June 2022}}</ref>

==Economy==
Bizerte's economy is very diverse. There are several military bases and year-round tourism. As a tourist centre the region is however not as popular as the eastern coast of Tunisia. There is manufacturing (textile, auto parts, cookware), fishing, fruits and vegetables, and wheat.

* The port of Bizerte is being developed into a significant Mediterranean yachting marina that was scheduled to open in May 2012.{{update inline|date=December 2021}} The superyacht section of the marina will be called Goga Superyacht Marina, and will have berths for yachts of up to 110m in length. It is expected that this will give a significant boost to the local economy as the yacht owners and also the hundreds of professional crew will become year-round consumers. The service industries supplying the yachts will gradually develop and bring additional employment.<ref>{{cite web |author=Morley Yachts |url=http://www.GogaMarina.com |title=Goga Superyacht Marina |publisher=Gogamarina.com |date=29 July 2009 |access-date=4 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605024331/http://gogamarina.com/ |archive-date=5 June 2013 }}</ref>

The city and see of Hippo Diarrhytus should not be confused with those of [[Hippo Regius]] where [[Saint Augustine]] of Hippo was the bishop.

== Serbian Army in Bizerte 1915‚Äì1919 ==
=== Army ===
[[Image: Bizerta srpsko vojnicko groblje.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Serbian military cemetery in Bizerte]]

After the [[Serbian army's retreat through Albania]] in 1915, during [[World War I]], part of the army was transported by the French navy to their naval base in Bizerte. Serbian soldiers, and a small number of civilians, arrived in Bizerte on three occasions. In December 1915 and early 1916, after the Albanian Golgotha, then later in 1916 after the first clashes on the [[Salonica front]] in Greece and in the early 1917 when Serbian volunteers began to gather in Bizerte. During the entire war, the soldiers were transported to the Salonica front while the wounded were transported back to Tunisia. It is estimated that over 60,000 Serbian soldiers passed through the camp. The training of the volunteers was organized in the camp, education of the disabled but also the cultural events.<ref name=vojska>{{cite web|url= http://www.istorijskabiblioteka.com/art:srpska-vojska-u-bizerti |title= Srpska vojska u Bizerti |publisher=Istorijska biblioteka|language=sr}}</ref> French-Serbian dictionary was compiled and published by [[Veselin ƒåajkanoviƒá]] in Bizerte. Out of 7,000 copies, 5,000 and 1,000 were distributed to Serbian and French soldiers, respectively, while the remaining 1,000 copies were sold, with money being donated to the war invalids.<ref name=bizerta>{{cite news | author = Branko Pejoviƒá | script-title=sr: –°—Ä–±–∏ –Ω–∞ —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä—É –ê—Ñ—Ä–∏–∫–µ —É—á–∏–ª–∏ —Ñ—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü—É—Å–∫–∏ | trans-title = Serbs in North Africa learned French language | newspaper = Politika | language = sr | date = 8 February 2000}}</ref>

Serbian wounded soldiers were originally placed in the Lambert barrack. Few days later they were relocated to the {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} away camp Lazouaz. Almost 200 barracks were built in the camp complex.<ref name=bizerta/> Citizens of Bizerte, French soldiers and administration were highly obliging to the Serbs, especially the Bizerte governor, admiral [[√âmile Gu√©pratte]]. He was involved in the care of the soldiers on daily basis and organized ceremonial greetings for every ship upon arrival. The last Serbian soldiers left Bizerte on 18 August 1919.<ref name=vojska/> Admiral Gu√©pratte directly disobeyed the order from the French High Command by which he was ordered to dislocate Serbs into the Sahara's hinterland.<ref name="Politika">{{Citation | author = Slobodan Kljakiƒá | title = Svedoƒçanstvo o srpskim vojnicima u severnoj Africi | newspaper = [[Politika]] | language = sr | date = 16 March 2015 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/321929/Svedocanstvo-o-srpskim-vojnicima-u-severnoj-Africi}}</ref> When Gu√©pratte visited [[Belgrade]] for the first time in 1930, he was awaited by the crowd which carried the admiral on their shoulders from the [[Belgrade Main railway station]] to the [[Slavija Square]]. The street where the admiral was carried, today bears his name ({{langx|sr| –£–ª–∏—Ü–∞ –∞–¥–º–∏—Ä–∞–ª–∞ –ì–µ–ø—Ä–∞—Ç–∞ | lit = Admiral Gu√©pratte Street}})''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Beograd ‚Äì plan grada|date=2006|publisher=M@gic M@p|isbn=86-83501-53-1}}</ref>

=== Hospitals ===

In Northern Africa, Serbian wounded soldiers were treated in the hospitals in Bizerte, [[Tunis]], [[Sousse]], [[Menzel Bourguiba|Sidi Abdala]], [[Algiers]], [[Oran]] and [[Annaba]]. From December 1915 to August 1919, a total of 41,153 Serbian soldiers were treated. In Tunisian hospitals, 833 soldiers died ([[typhus]], [[malaria]], wounds, hunger and [[frostbite]]s). In Sidi Abdala, local population helped the Serbs providing food, medicines and nurture. A total of 1,722 people died there.<ref name="Politika"/>

=== Cemeteries ===
The dead in Bizerte, Sousse and Tunis were buried in the memorial [[ossuary]] on the Christian cemetery in Bizerte. Those who died in Sidi Abdala were interred on the joint French-Serbian military cemetery. Those two cemeteries are the largest of all in Northern Africa where Serbian soldiers were buried ‚Äì a total of 24 cemeteries in Tunisia, [[Algeria]] and [[Morocco]], with 3,005 buried soldiers.<ref name="Politika"/><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.blic.rs/vesti/reportaza/vecna-straza-kraj-bizerte/92f7wp5 |author=Ranko Pivljanin |title= Veƒçna stra≈æa kraj Bizerte |date=24 May 2010| publisher= [[Blic]]|language=sr}}</ref>
