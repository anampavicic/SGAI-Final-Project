The '''Manjung District''', formerly known as '''Dindings''', is a [[list of districts in Malaysia|district]] in the south-western part of the state of [[Perak]], [[Malaysia]]. It is the [[List of districts in Malaysia|26th-most populated district]] in Malaysia.<ref>https://www.dosm.gov.my/uploads/publications/20221020150523.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=August 2024}}</ref> It is administered by the '''Manjung Municipal Council''' ({{lang-ms|Majlis Perbandaran Manjung}}), formerly known as '''Manjung District Council''' ({{lang-ms|Majlis Daerah Manjung}}) from 1 January 1980 until 31 July 2001. The district is well known for [[Pangkor Island]], an attraction in Perak and the home of the [[Royal Malaysian Navy]] (TLDM), [[RMN Lumut Naval Base|Lumut Naval Base and dockyard]]. Dinding was once part of the British [[Straits Settlements]] colony. [[Seri Manjung]] is the district's principal urban centre while smaller towns include [[Lumut, Malaysia|Lumut]] town, [[Sitiawan]] town, [[Ayer Tawar]], [[Pantai Remis]], [[Changkat Keruing|Changkat Keruning]] and [[Beruas]].

==History==
{{refimprove|date=February 2023}}
[[File:Pulo Pangkor, Malaya 1874 (7886261828).jpg|thumb|View of Dindings, taken from a hill in Pulau Pangkor, 1874.|left]]
Prior to 1873, the district was called Dindings and was part of the [[Straits Settlements]], then under the administration of [[Penang]]. Dindings district became part of the [[Pangkor Treaty of 1874|Pangkor Treaty]] signed by Britain, and the British appointed Sultan of [[Perak]] [[Abdullah Muhammad Shah II of Perak|Sultan Abdullah]], in January 1874. This agreement was signed to stop the bloodshed resulting from two major events: the power struggle among Perak royalty upon the death of Sultan Ali; and Chinese clan wars between [[Ghee Hin Kongsi|Ghee Hin]] and [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] to grab tin mining areas in late colonial [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]].<ref>See pages 86–88, Chapter 8 Malaysian Confrontations, Send A Gunboat: The Victorian Navy and Supremacy at Sea, 1854–1904, by Antony Preston & John Major, Conway, an imprint of Anova Books Ltd, London, UK, 2007 Revised Edition, {{ISBN|978-0-85177-923-2}}</ref> 

The agreement required the [[Sultan of Perak]] to surrender Dindings to the British, to accept a British Resident, [[James W. W. Birch]], and the appointment of an assistant resident in Taiping, Captain [[Tristram Speedy]]. Sultan Ismail was also to abdicate the throne of Perak.

During the British colonial era, colonial Dindings comprised three main areas: [[Sitiawan]], [[Lumut, Malaysia|Lumut]] and [[Pangkor Island]].

The British had hoped that Dindings would prove to be a valuable natural harbour.<ref>[https://britishmalaya.home.blog/2022/08/02/dindings-the-forgotten-territory/ Dindings, the forgotten member of the Straits Settlements]</ref> However, this did not become the case.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|wstitle=Straits Settlements|last=Clifford|first=Hugh Charles|author-link=Hugh Clifford (colonial administrator)|volume=25|pages=980–981|inline=1}}</ref> In 1935, Sultan [[Iskandar of Perak|Iskandar Alang]] successfully appealed to the British for the return of Dindings to Perak. The Perak government united the former colony with [[Beruas|Bruas]] and coastal areas to the south, forming the Dindings District. In 1973, it was given the current name, Manjung.

On 24 April 2009, Lumut was declared by the Sultan of Perak as the [[Royal Malaysian Navy]]'s Town, abbreviated as “TLDM Town” or “Navy Town”. Manjung also was declared as “''Bandar Pelancongan dan Maritim”'' (“Tourism and Maritime Town”) by state government of Perak.

In August 2016, Sembilan Island was separated from Manjung District and incorporated into [[Bagan Datuk District]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sinarharian.com.my/edisi/perak/pulau-sembilan-kini-bawah-bagan-datoh-1.549401|title=Pulau Sembilan kini bawah Bagan Datoh|first=MOHAMAD HAFIZI MOHD|last=SAID|access-date=8 November 2016}}</ref>
