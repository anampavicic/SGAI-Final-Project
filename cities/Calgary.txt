== Etymology ==
Calgary was named after [[Calgary Castle]] (in Scottish Gaelic, {{lang|gd|Caisteal Chalgairidh}}) on the [[Isle of Mull]] in [[Scotland]].<ref name=ABplacenames>{{cite book | title=Alberta Place Names: The Fascinating People & Stories Behind the Naming of Alberta | first1=Larry |last1=Donovan |first2=Tom |last2=Monto | publisher=Dragon Hill Publishing Ltd. | page=34 | year=2006}}</ref> Colonel [[James Macleod]], the Commissioner of the [[North-West Mounted Police]], had been a frequent summer guest there. In 1876, shortly after returning to [[Canada]], he suggested its name for what became [[Fort Calgary]]. The Scottish Gaelic placename {{lang|gd|Calgairidh}}, in turn, possibly originates from a compound of {{lang|non|kald}} and {{lang|non|gart}}, [[Old Norse]] words, meaning "cold" and "garden". If so, the placename is likely a relic of Norse settler-colonists who occupied the [[Inner Hebrides]] in the medieval period.<ref>{{full citation needed|date=August 2011}} Mull Museum, Tobermory, Isle of Mull, Scotland. Retrieved July 10, 2007.</ref> A competing etymology cites the [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] {{lang|gd|cala[dh] gàrraidh}}, which means "enclosed meadow (or pasture) harbour", or, alternatively, {{lang|gd|cala[dh]-gheàrraidh}}, meaning "harbour pasture".<ref name=ABplacenames/><ref>{{Cite book |last=Dwelly |first=Edward |title=The Illustrated Gaelic Dictionary: Specially Designed for Beginners and for Use in Schools, Vol. 2 |publisher=Edwary Dwelly |year=1911 |edition=Revised |location=Herne Bay, UK |pages=456, 477 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Dwelly |first=Edward |title=The Illustrated Gaelic Dictionary: Specially Designed for Beginners and for Use in Schools, Vol. 1 |publisher=Edward Dwelly |year=1911 |edition=Revised |location=Herne Bay, UK |pages=155 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fraser |first=Ian A. |title=Some further thoughts on Scandinavian place-names in Lewis |url=https://www.ssns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fraser_1984_Vol_21_pp_34_41.pdf |journal=Northern Studies |issue=21 |pages=36, 37 |via=Scottish Society for Northern Studies}}</ref> The first of these two possibilities, arguably translatable as "meadow harbour", has some relevance to local geography: the town of Calgary, such as it is, has a large meadow to its east, and this meadow leads to Calgary beach.

The name of the city serves as a [[shibboleth]], as residents pronounce the name with two syllables, {{IPA|en-CA|ˈkæl.ɡɚ.i|}}, while others pronounce it {{IPA|en-CA|ˈkæl.ɡɹi|local|}}.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":6">{{Cite web |last=Good Question, Saskatchewan |date=April 9, 2024 |title=Why do Saskatchewan people say Calgary wrong? |url=https://www.cbc.ca/listen/cbc-podcasts/1416-good-question-saskatchewan/episode/16054727-why-do-saskatchewan-people-say-calgary-wrong |access-date=May 6, 2024 |website=CBC Listen}}</ref>

The [[Treaty 7|Indigenous peoples of Southern Alberta]] refer to the Calgary area as "elbow", in reference to the sharp bend made by the [[Bow River]] and the [[Elbow River]]. In some cases, the area was named after the [[Phragmites|reeds]] that grew along the riverbanks, reeds that had been used to fashion [[Bow and arrow|bows]]. In the [[Blackfoot language]] (Siksiká) the area is known as {{lang|bla|Mohkínstsis akápiyoyis}}, meaning "elbow many houses", reflecting its strong settler presence.

== History ==
{{For timeline}}

=== Early history ===
The Calgary area was inhabited by pre-[[Clovis culture|Clovis]] people whose presence traces back at least 11,000 years.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.ucalgary.ca/~walde/testtime.html | title= Archaeology Timeline of Alberta | publisher= University of Calgary | access-date= May 10, 2007 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120329150036/http://people.ucalgary.ca/~walde/testtime.html | archive-date= March 29, 2012 | url-status= live }}</ref> The area has been inhabited by multiple [[First Nations in Canada|First Nations]], the Niitsitapi (Blackfoot Confederacy; [[Siksika Nation|Siksika]], [[Kainai Nation|Kainai]], [[Piegan Blackfeet|Piikani]]), îyârhe [[Assiniboine|Nakoda]] [[Tsuutʼina Nation|Tsuutʼina]] peoples and [[Métis]] Nation, Region 3.

In 1787, [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], a 17-year-old [[cartographer]] with the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC), spent the winter with a band of [[Piikani Nation]] encamped along the Bow River. He was also a [[fur trade]]r and surveyor and the first recorded European to visit the area. [[John Glenn (Alberta)|John Glenn]] was the first documented European settler in the Calgary area, in 1873.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://tprc.alberta.ca/parks/fishcreek/glenns.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220124/http://tprc.alberta.ca/parks/fishcreek/glenns.asp|archive-date=September 27, 2007| title=The Glenns|publisher=Alberta Tourism Parks, Recreation and Culture| access-date=August 24, 2007}}</ref> In spring 1875, three priests{{snd}} Lacombe, Remus, and Scollen{{snd}} built a small log cabin on the banks of the Elbow River.{{sfn|McGinnis|1975|p=7}}
[[File:FortCalgary1878.jpg|thumb|left|In 1875, the [[North-West Mounted Police]] erected [[Fort Calgary]] to police the area.]]
In the fall of 1875, the site became a post of the [[North-West Mounted Police]] (NWMP) (now the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] or RCMP). The NWMP detachment was assigned to protect the western plains from US whisky traders, and to protect the [[North American fur trade|fur trade]], and Inspector [[Éphrem-A. Brisebois]] led fifty Mounties as part of F Troop north from [[Fort Macleod]] to establish the site.{{sfn|McGinnis|1975|p=7}} The [[I. G. Baker Company]] of [[Fort Benton, Montana]], was contracted to construct a suitable fort, and after its completion, the Baker company built a log store next to the fort.{{sfn|McGinnis|1975|p=8}} The NWMP fort remained officially nameless until construction was complete, although it had been referred to as ''"The Mouth"'' by people at Fort Macleod.{{sfn|MacEwan|1975|p=10}} At Christmas dinner NWMP Inspector Éphrem-A. Brisebois christened the unnamed Fort ''"Fort Brisebois"'', a decision which caught the ire of his superiors Colonel [[James Macleod]] and Major [[Acheson Irvine]].{{sfn|MacEwan|1975|p=10}} Major Irvine cancelled the order by Brisebois and wrote [[Hewitt Bernard]], the then [[List of deputy ministers of justice (Canada)|Deputy Minister of Justice]] in Ottawa, describing the situation and suggesting the name ''"Calgary"'' put forward by Colonel Macleod. [[Edward Blake]], at the time [[Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada|Minister of Justice]], agreed with the name and in the spring of 1876, Fort Calgary was officially established.{{sfn|MacEwan|1975|p=11}}

In 1877, the First Nations ceded title to the Fort Calgary region through Treaty 7.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

In 1881 the federal government began to offer leases for cattle ranching in Alberta (up to {{convert|100000|acre|km2|order=flip|abbr=on}} for one cent per acre per year) under the ''[[Dominion Lands Act]]'', which became a catalyst for immigration to the settlement. The I. G. Baker Company drove the first herd of cattle to the region in the same year for the [[Cochrane, Alberta|Cochrane]] area by order of Major James Walker.{{sfn|McGinnis|1975|p=9}}

The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) reached the area in August 1883 and constructed a railway station on the CPR-owned Section 15, neighbouring the townsite across the Elbow River to the east on Section 14. The difficulty in crossing the river and the CPR's efforts to persuade residents resulted in the core of the Calgary townsite moving onto Section 15, with the fate of the old townsite sealed when the post office was anonymously moved across the icy Elbow River during the night.{{sfn|McGinnis|1975|p=10}} The CPR subdivided Section 15 and began selling lots surrounding the station, $450 for corner lots and $350 for all others; and pioneer Felix McHugh constructed the first private building on the site.{{sfn|McGinnis|1975|p=10}} Earlier in the decade it was not expected that the railway would pass near Calgary; instead, the preferred route put forward by people concerned with the young nation's defence was passing near Edmonton and through the [[Yellowhead Pass]]. However, in 1881 CPR changed the plans preferring the direct route through the prairies by way of [[Kicking Horse Pass]].{{sfn|MacEwan|1975|p=30}} Along with the CPR, August 1883 brought Calgary the first edition of the ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' published on the 31st under the title ''The Calgary Herald, Mining and Ranche Advocate and General Advertiser'' by teacher Andrew M. Armour and printer Thomas B. Braden, a weekly newspaper with a subscription price of $1 per year.{{sfn|MacEwan|1975|p=36}}

Over a century later, the CPR headquarters moved to Calgary from [[Montreal]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://business.financialpost.com/2012/11/23/cp-rail-moving-headquarters-from-glass-tower-in-calgary-to-nearby-rail-yard-sources/ | title=CP Rail moving headquarters from glass tower in Calgary to nearby rail yard: union source | newspaper=Financial Post | publisher=Postmedia Network Inc. |first1=Susan |last1=Taylor |first2=Nicole |last2=Mordant | date=November 23, 2012 | access-date=June 15, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530205727/http://business.financialpost.com/2012/11/23/cp-rail-moving-headquarters-from-glass-tower-in-calgary-to-nearby-rail-yard-sources/ | archive-date=May 30, 2013 | url-status=live }}</ref>

Residents of the now-eight-year-old settlement sought to form a local government of their own. In the first weeks of 1884, [[James Reilly (Canadian politician)|James Reilly]] who was building the Royal Hotel east of the Elbow River circulated 200 [[Flyer (pamphlet)|handbills]] announcing a public meeting on January 7, 1884, at the Methodist Church.{{sfn|MacEwan|1975|p=38}}{{sfn|MacEwan|1966|p=48}} At the full meeting Reilly advocated for a bridge across the Elbow River and a civic committee to watch over the interests of the public until Calgary could be incorporated. The attendees were enthusiastic about the committee and on the next evening a vote was held to elect the seven members. A total of 24 candidates were nominated, which equalled 10 per cent of Calgary's male population. Major James Walker received 88 votes, the most amongst the candidates, the other six members were Dr. Andrew Henderson, [[George Clift King]], Thomas Swan, George Murdoch, J. D. Moulton, and Captain John Stewart.{{sfn|MacEwan|1975|p=38}} The civic committee met with [[Edgar Dewdney]], [[Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories]], who happened to be in Calgary at the time,{{sfn|MacEwan|1966|p=48}} to discuss an allowance for a school, an increase from $300 to $1,000 grant for a bridge over the Elbow River, incorporation as a town, and representation for Calgary in the [[Legislative Council of the North-West Territories]].{{sfn|MacEwan|1975|p=39}} The committee was successful in getting an additional $200 for the bridge,{{sfn|MacEwan|1975|p=39}}
In May, Major Walker, acting on instructions from the NWT Lieutenant-governor, organized a public meeting in the NWMP barracks room on the issue of getting a representative in the NWT Council. Walker wrote the clerk of the Council that he was prepared to produce evidence that Calgary and environs (an area of 1000 square miles) held 1000 residents, the requirement for having a Council member.<ref>Calgary Herald, May 7, 1884</ref> 
A [[by-election]] was held on June 28, 1884, where [[James Davidson Geddes]] defeated James Kidd Oswald to become the [[Calgary (N.W.T. electoral district)|Calgary electoral district]] representative on the [[1st Council of the North-West Territories]].{{sfn|MacEwan|1966|pp=57-58}}<ref>{{cite web |title=North-West Territories: Council and Legislative Assembly, 1876-1905 |url=https://www.saskarchives.com/sites/default/files/documents/NWT-Council.pdf |website=saskarchives.com |publisher=Saskatchewan Archives |access-date=November 20, 2020 |pages=1–22 |archive-date=September 28, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928101028/http://www.saskarchives.com/web/seld/1-00.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

As for education, Calgary moved quickly: the Citizen's Committee raised $125 on February 6, 1884, and the first school opened for twelve children days later on February 18, led by teacher John William Costello.{{sfn|Stamp|1975|p=154}} The private school was not enough for the needs of the town and following a petition by James Walker the ''Calgary Protestant Public School District No. 19'' was formed by the Legislature on March 2, 1885.{{sfn|Stamp|1975|p=157}}

On November 27, 1884, Lieutenant Governor Dewdney proclaimed the [[Municipal corporation|incorporation]] of ''The Town of Calgary''.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/northwestterrito1884nort ''The North-West Municipal Ordinance of 1884'': Proclamation, The Town of Calgary] (1884).

''The North-West Municipal Ordinance of 1884'' provided [[Suffrage|voting rights]] to any male [[British subject]] over 21 years of age who owned at minimum $300 of property.

Law and order remained top of mind in the frontier town, in early 1884 Jack Campbell was appointed as a constable for the community, and in early 1885 the Town Council passed ''By-law Eleven'' creating the position of Chief Constable and assigning relevant duties, a precursor to the [[Calgary Police Service]]. The first chief constable, John (Jack) S. Ingram, who had previously served as the first police chief in Winnipeg, was empowered to arrest [[Public intoxication|drunken and disorderly]] people, stop all fast riding in town, attend all fires and council meetings.{{sfn|Ward|1975|p=274}}{{sfn|Thorner|1975|p=102}} Calgary Town Council was eager to employ constables versus contracting the NWMP for town duty as the police force was seen as a money-making proposition. Constables received half of the fines from liquor cases, meaning Chief Constable Ingram could easily pay his $60 per month salary and the expense of a town jail.{{sfn|Thorner|1975|p=102}}

===Turmoil in 1885 and 1886 and the "Sandstone City"===
For the Town of Calgary, 1884 turned out to be a success. However, two dark years lay ahead for the fledgling community. The turmoil started in late 1885, when Councillor Clarke was arrested for threatening a [[Undercover operation|plain-clothes]] Mountie who entered his saloon to conduct a late-night search. When the officer failed to produce a [[search warrant]], Clarke chased him off the premises; however, the Mountie returned with reinforcements and arrested Clarke.{{sfn|MacEwan|1966|p=50}} Clarke found himself before [[Stipendiary Magistrate]] [[Jeremiah Travis]], a proponent of the [[temperance movement]] who was appalled by the open traffic of liquor, gambling and prostitution in Calgary despite [[prohibition]] in the North-West Territories.{{sfn|MacEwan|1966|p=51}} Travis' view was accurate as the Royal Commission of Liquor Traffic of 1892 found liquor was sold openly, both day and night during prohibition.{{sfn|Thorner|1975|p=102}} Travis associated Clarke with the troubles he saw in Calgary and found him guilty, and sentenced Clarke to six months with [[hard labour]].{{sfn|MacEwan|1966|p=51}} Murdoch and the other members of Council were shocked, and a public meeting was held at Boynton's Hall in which a decision was made to send a delegation to Ottawa to seek an overruling of Travis' judgement by the Department of Justice. The community quickly raised $500, and Murdoch and a group of residents headed east.{{sfn|MacEwan|1966|p=51}} The punishment of Clarke did not escape [[Hugh Cayley]] the editor of the ''Calgary Herald'' and [[Court clerk|Clerk]] of the District Court. Cayley published articles critical of Travis and his judgment, in which Travis responded by calling Cayley to court, dismissing him from his position as Clerk, ordering Cayley to apologize and pay a $100 fine.{{sfn|MacEwan|1966|p=52}} Cayley refused to pay the fine, which Travis increased to $500, and on January 5, the day after [[January 1886 Calgary municipal election|the January 1886 Calgary town election]], Cayley was imprisoned by Travis.{{sfn|MacEwan|1966|p=52}}

Murdoch returned to Calgary on December 27, 1885, only a week before the election to find the town in disarray.{{sfn|MacEwan|1966|p=52}} Shortly before the 1886 election, G. E. Marsh brought a charge of corruption against Murdoch and council over irregularities in the voters' list. Travis found Murdoch and the councillors guilty, disqualifying them from running in the 1886 election, barring them from municipal office for two years, and fining Murdoch $100, and the councillors $20. This was despite the fact Murdoch was visiting Eastern Canada while the alleged tampering was occurring.<ref name="TaylorReport">{{cite book |url=https://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/200/301/pco-bcp/commissions-ef/taylor1886-eng/taylor1886-eng.pdf |last1=Wardlaw Taylor |first1=Thomas |title=Precis of the Case of Jeremiah Travis (Late Stipendiary Magistrate at Calgary) As Presented By the Report of Mr. Justice Taylor and the Correspondence and Evidence |date=1886 |publisher=Privy Council Office |location=Ottawa, Ontario |pages=5–6}}</ref> Travis' disqualification did not dissuade Calgary voters, and Murdoch defeated his opponent James Reilly by a significant margin in early January to be re-elected as mayor.<ref name="1886CalHerald">{{cite news |title=Yesterday's Election |url=http://peel.library.ualberta.ca/newspapers/CWH/1886/01/06/4/ |access-date=March 8, 2020 |work=The Calgary Herald |issue=18 |date=January 6, 1886 |page=4}}</ref> Travis accepted a petition from Reilly to unseat Murdoch and two of the elected councillors, and declare Reilly the mayor of Calgary.{{sfn|MacEwan|1966|p=53}} Both Murdoch and Reilly claimed to be the lawful mayor of the growingly disorganized Town of Calgary, both holding council meetings and attempting to govern.{{sfn|MacEwan|1966|p=53}} Word of the issues in Calgary reached the Minister of Justice [[John Sparrow David Thompson]] in Ottawa who ordered Justice [[Thomas Wardlaw Taylor]] of [[Winnipeg]] to conduct an inquiry into the ''"Case of Jeremiah Travis"''.

[[File:Big fire on 9th Avenue SE, Calgary, Alberta.png|thumb|left|Downtown after the [[Calgary Fire of 1886]]]]
Calgary had only a couple days' peace following the November election before the [[Calgary Fire of 1886]] destroyed much of the community's downtown. Part of the slow response to the fire can be attributed to the absence of functioning local government during 1886. As neither George Murdoch or James Reilly was capable of effectively governing the town, the newly ordered [[Fire engine|chemical engine]] for the recently organized [[Calgary Fire Department]] (Calgary Hook, Ladder and Bucket Corps) was held in the CPR's storage yard due to lack of payment. Members of the Calgary Fire Department broke into the CPR storage yard on the day of the fire to retrieve the engine.{{sfn|Ward|1975|p=255}} In total, fourteen buildings were destroyed with losses estimated at $103,200, although no one was killed or injured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calgary.ca/CSPS/Fire/Pages/History/1800s-the-great-fire.aspx |title=The Great Fire of 1886 |access-date=January 26, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823135106/http://www.calgary.ca/CSPS/Fire/Pages/History/1800s-the-great-fire.aspx |archive-date=August 23, 2013 }}</ref>

The new Town Council sprung into action, drafting a bylaw requiring all large downtown buildings to be built with [[sandstone]], which was readily available nearby in the form of [[Paskapoo Formation|Paskapoo sandstone]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thegauntlet.ca/story/8857 |title=The Sandstone City |date=November 21, 2002 |access-date=March 6, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813194522/http://thegauntlet.ca/story/8857 |archive-date=August 13, 2011 }}</ref> Following the fire several quarries were opened around the city by prominent local businessmen including Thomas Edworthy, [[Wesley Fletcher Orr]], J.

In February 1887, [[Donald Watson Davis]], who was running the [[I.G. Baker]] store in Calgary, was elected MP for [[Alberta (Provisional District)]]. A former whisky trader in southern Alberta, he had turned his hand to building Fort Macleod and Fort Calgary. The main other contender for the job, [[Frank Oliver (politician)|Frank Oliver]], was a prominent Edmontonian, so Davis's success was a sign that Calgary was surpassing Edmonton, previously the main centre on the western Prairies.<ref>MacGregor, Alberta, p. 121, 124</ref>

===1887 to 1900===

Calgary continued to expand when real estate speculation took hold of Calgary in 1889. Speculators began buying and building west of Centre Street, and Calgary quickly began to sprawl west to the ire of property owners on the east side of town.{{sfn|Foran|1975|p=204}} Property owners on both sides of Centre Street sought to bring development to their side of Calgary, lost successfully{{clarify|lost successfully|date=January 2022}} by eastsider James Walker who convinced the Town Council to purchase land on the east side to build a stockyard, guaranteeing meat packing and processing plants would be constructed on the east side.{{sfn|Foran|1975|p=208}} By 1892 Calgary had reached present-day [[17 Avenue SW (Calgary)|Seventeenth Avenue]], east to the Elbow River and west to Eighth Street,{{sfn|Foran|1975|p=205}} and the first federal census listed the boom town at 3,876 inhabitants.<ref name=1906census>{{cite book | title=Census of the Northwest Provinces, 1906 | volume=Sessional Paper No. 17a | year=1907 | publisher=[[Government of Canada]] | location=Ottawa | page=100 | chapter=Table IX: Population of cities, towns and incorporated villages in 1906 and 1901 as classed in 1906}}</ref> The economic conditions in Calgary began to deteriorate in 1892,{{sfn|Foran|1975|p=219}} as development in the downtown slowed, the streetcar system started in 1889 was put on hold{{sfn|Foran|1975|p=206}} and smaller property owners began to sell.{{sfn|MacEwan|1975|p=77}}

The first step in connecting the [[District of Alberta]] happened in Calgary on July 21, 1890, as [[Minister of the Interior (Canada)|Minister of the Interior]] Edgar Dewdney [[Groundbreaking|turned the first sod]] for the [[Calgary and Edmonton Railway]] in front of two thousand residents.{{sfn|MacEwan|1975|p=66}}{{sfn|Ward|1975|p=229}} The railway was completed in August 1891. Although its end-of-steel was on the [[Old Strathcona|south side of the river opposite Edmonton]], it immensely shortened travel time between the two communities. Previously stagecoach passengers and mail could arrive in five days and animal pulled freight anywhere between two and three weeks,{{sfn|MacEwan|1975|p=67}} the train was able to make the trip in only a few hours.{{sfn|Ward|1975|p=230}}

[[Smallpox]] arrived in Calgary in June 1892 when a Chinese resident was found with the disease, and by August nine people had contracted the disease with three deaths. Calgarians placed the blame for the disease on the local Chinese population, resulting in a riot on August 2, 1892.{{sfn|Dawson|1975|p=128}} Residents descended on the Town's Chinese-owned laundries, smashing windows and attempting to burn the structures to the ground. The local police did not attempt to intervene. Mayor [[Alexander Lucas]] had inexplicably left town during the riot,{{sfn|Dawson|1975|p=132}} and when he returned home he called the NWMP in to patrol Calgary for three weeks to prevent further riots.{{sfn|Dawson|1975|p=130}}{{sfn|Thorner|1975|p=106}}

Finally on January 1, 1894, Calgary was granted a [[Municipal charter|charter]] by the [[2nd North-West Legislative Assembly]], officially titled ''Ordinance 33 of 1894'', the City of Calgary Charter elevated the frontier town to the status of a full-fledged city.<ref>{{Cite canlaw|short title =Calgary Charter |abbr =|year =1893|chapter =33|section =|subsection =|part =|division =|schedule =|link =https://cdm22007.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p22007coll9/id/629544|linkloc =|wikilink =|type =}}</ref> Calgary became the first city in the North-West Territories, receiving its charter a decade before [[Edmonton]] and [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]]. The Calgary charter remained in force until it was repealed with the ''Cities Act'' in 1950. The charter came into effect in such a way as to prevent the regularly scheduled municipal election in December 1893, and recognizing the importance of the moment, the entire Town Council resigned to ensure the new city could choose the first [[Calgary City Council]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bly |first1=David |title=City Hall history provides tantalizing tales |work=[[Calgary Herald]] |date=October 9, 2001 |page=B4}}</ref> [[January 1894 Calgary municipal election|Calgary's first municipal election]] as a city saw Wesley Fletcher Orr garner 244 votes, narrowly defeating his opponent [[William Henry Cushing]]'s 220 votes, and Orr was named the first mayor of the City of Calgary.<ref name="Jan1894CgyHerald">{{cite news |url=http://contentdm.ucalgary.ca/digital/collection/p22007coll24/id/12052 |access-date=November 20, 2020 |work=The Calgary Herald |issue=38 |date=January 16, 1894 |page=4 |title=The Municipal Elections}}</ref>

By late 19th century, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) expanded into the interior and established posts along rivers that later developed into the modern cities of Winnipeg, Calgary and Edmonton. In 1884, the HBC established a sales shop in Calgary. HBC also built the first of the grand "original six" department stores in Calgary in 1913; others that followed were Edmonton, [[Vancouver]], [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[Saskatoon]], and Winnipeg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.hbc.com/hbc/history/|title=Hudson's Bay Company – Our History|work=hbc.com|access-date=April 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531192023/http://www2.hbc.com/hbc/history/|archive-date=May 31, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/timeline/early/|title=HBC Heritage – Early Stores|work=hbcheritage.ca|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927094024/http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/timeline/early/|archive-date=September 27, 2015}}</ref>

In October 1899 the Village of Rouleauville was incorporated by French Catholic residents south of Calgary's city limits in what is now known as [[Mission, Calgary|Mission]].{{sfn|Foran|1975|pp=205-206}} The town did not remain independent for long, and became the first incorporated municipality to be amalgamated into Calgary eight years later in 1907.

=== Turn of the 20th century ===

The turn of the century brought questions of provincehood the top of mind in Calgary. On September 1, 1905, [[Alberta]] was proclaimed a province with a provisional capital in [[Edmonton]], it would be left up to the Legislature to choose the permanent location.{{sfn|MacEwan|1966|p=41}} One of the first decisions of the new Alberta Legislature was the capital, and although [[William Henry Cushing]] advocated strongly for Calgary, the resulting vote saw Edmonton win the capital 16–8.{{sfn|MacEwan|1966|p=44}} Calgarians were disappointed on the city not being named the capital, and focused their attention on the formation of the provincial university. However, the efforts by the community could not sway the government, and the [[University of Alberta]] was founded in the [[City of Strathcona]], Premier Rutherford's home, which was subsequently amalgamated into the City of Edmonton in 1912.{{sfn|MacEwan|1975|pp=44-45}} Calgary was not to be left without higher education facilities as the provincial [[Normal School]] opened in the McDougall School building in 1905. In 1910, R. B. Bennett introduced a bill in the Alberta Legislature to incorporate the "Calgary University", however there was significant opposition to two degree-granting institutions in such a small province. A commission was appointed to evaluate the Calgary proposal which found the second university to be unnecessary, however, the commission did recommend the formation of the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art in Calgary ([[Southern Alberta Institute of Technology|SAIT]]), which was formed later in 1915.{{sfn|MacEwan|1975|pp=129-130}}

Built-up areas of Calgary between 1905 and 1912 were serviced by power and water, the city continued a program of paving and sidewalk laying and with the CPR constructed a series of subways under the tracks to connect the town with streetcars. The first three motor buses hit Calgary streets in 1907, and two years later the [[Calgary municipal railway|municipally owned street railway system]], fit with seven miles of track opened in Calgary. The immediately popular street railway system reached 250,000 passengers per month by 1910.{{sfn|Foran|1975|p=212}} The privately owned MacArthur Bridge (precursor to the Centre Street Bridge over the Bow River) opened in 1907 which provided for residential expansion north of the Bow River.{{sfn|Foran|1975|pp=209-210}} The early-1910s saw real estate speculation hit Calgary once again, with property prices rising significantly with growing municipal investment, CPR's decision to construct a car shop at [[Ogden, Calgary|Ogden]] set to employ over 5,000 people, the projected arrival of the [[Grand Trunk Pacific]] and [[Canadian Northern Railway]]s in the city and Calgary's growing reputation as a growing economic hub.{{sfn|Foran|1975|p=213}} The period between 1906 and 1911 was the largest population growth period in the city's history, expanding from 11,967 to 43,704 inhabitants in the five-year period.<ref name=1906census/><ref name=1911census>{{cite book | title=Census of Canada, 1911 | volume=I | year=1912 | publisher=[[Government of Canada]] | location=Ottawa | pages=2–39 | chapter=Table I: Area and Population of Canada by Provinces, Districts and Subdistricts in 1911 and Population in 1901}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Birth of the province|last=Byfield|first=Ted|publisher=United Western Communications|year=1992|isbn=978-0969571810|location=Edmonton|page=156}}</ref> Several ambitious projects were started during this period including a new [[Calgary City Hall|City Hall]], the [[Hudson's Bay (department store)|Hudson's Bay Department Store]], the Grain Exchange Building, and the [[Palliser Hotel]], this period also corresponded to the end of the ''"Sandstone City"'' era as steel frames and terracotta facades such as the Burns Building (1913) which were prevalent in other North American cities overtook the unique sandstone character of Calgary.{{sfn|Kalman|1994|p=530}}

===Stampede City===

[[File:Rounding up for the first Calgary Stampede (38085634056).jpg|thumb|left|Rounding up cattle for the first [[Calgary Stampede]] in 1912. The Stampede is one of the world's largest rodeos.]]
The growing City and enthusiastic residents were rewarded in 1908 with the federally funded [[Dominion Exhibition]]. Seeking to take advantage of the opportunity to promote itself, the city spent {{CAD|145,000}} to build six new pavilions and a racetrack.{{sfn|Dixon|Read|2005|p=29}} It held a lavish parade as well as [[rodeo]], horse racing, and [[trick roping]] competitions as part of the event.<ref name="GuysDream">{{citation |last=Dudley |first=Wendy |title=Guy's Stampede dream |work=Calgary Herald |date=July 3, 1997 |page=SS2}}</ref> The exhibition was a success, drawing 100,000 people to the fairgrounds over seven days despite an economic recession that afflicted the city of 25,000.{{sfn|Dixon|Read|2005|p=29}} Calgary had previously held a number of Agricultural exhibitions dating back to 1886, and recognizing the city's enthusiasm, [[Guy Weadick]], an American trick roper who participated in the Dominion Exhibition as part of the [[Miller Brothers 101 Ranch]] Real Wild West Show, returned to Calgary in 1912 to host the first [[Calgary Stampede]] in the hopes of establishing an event that more accurately represented the "wild west" than the shows he was a part of.{{sfn|Dixon|Read|2005|p=30}} He initially failed to sell civic leaders and the Calgary Industrial Exhibition on his plans,<ref name="CHWeadickVision">{{citation |last=Seskus |first=Tony |url=https://calgaryherald.com/homes/stampede/6479984/story.html |title=Guy Weadick's grand vision |work=Calgary Herald |date=April 30, 2012 |access-date=June 9, 2012 |archive-date=June 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618200017/http://www.calgaryherald.com/homes/stampede/6479984/story.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> but with the assistance of local livestock agent H.

===Early oil and gas===

While agriculture and railway activities were the dominant aspects of Calgary's early economy, the [[Turner Valley]] ''Discovery Well'' blew South-West of Calgary on May 14, 1914, marked the beginning of the oil and gas age in Calgary. Archibald Wayne Dingman and Calgary Petroleum Product's discovery was heralded as the ''"biggest oil field in the British Empire"'' at around 19 million cubic metres, and in a three-week period an estimated 500 oil companies sprang into existence.{{sfn|MacEwan|1975|p=145}} Calgarians were enthusiastic to invest in new oil companies, with many losing life savings during the short 1914 boom in hastily formed companies.{{sfn|MacEwan|1975|p=146}} Outbreak of the [[First World War]] further dampened the oil craze as more men and resources left for Europe and agricultural prices for wheat and cattle increased.{{sfn|MacEwan|1975|p=146}} Turner Valley's oil fields would boom again in 1924 and 1936, and by the [[Second World War]] the Turner Valley oilfield was producing more than 95 per cent of the oil in Canada.<ref>{{cite news |title=The 1924 Wonder Well in Turner Valley |url=https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/the-1924-wonder-well-in-turner-valley |access-date=November 20, 2020 |work=[[Calgary Herald]] |date=December 18, 2013}}</ref> however the city would wait until 1947 for [[Leduc No. 1]] to definitively shift Calgary to an oil and gas city. While Edmonton would see significant population and economic growth with the Leduc discovery, many corporate offices established in Calgary after Turner Valley refused to relocate north.{{sfn|Stenson|1994|pp=42-43}} Consequently, by 1967, Calgary had more millionaires than any other city in Canada, and per capita, more cars than any city in the world.<ref name="Sarasota20th">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NPYeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DYwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7547,3735181 |title=Alberta oil strike attracts Americans |work=Sarasota Journal |date=April 27, 1967 |access-date=September 30, 2011 |page=28}}</ref>

===Early politics 1910s to 1940s===

Early-20th-century Calgary served as a hotbed for political activity. Historically Calgarians supported the provincial and federal conservative parties, the opposite of the Liberal-friendly City of Edmonton. However, Calgarians were sympathetic to the cause of workers and supported the development of labour organizations. In 1909, the [[United Farmers of Alberta]] (UFA) formed in Edmonton through the merger of two earlier farm organizations as a non-partisan lobbying organization to represent the interests of farmers. The UFA eventually dropped its non-partisan stance when it contested the [[1921 Alberta general election|1921 provincial election]]. It was elected to form the province's first non-Liberal government.{{sfn|MacEwan|1975|p=167}} By that time Calgary was using [[single transferable vote]] (STV), a form of proportional representation, to elect its city councillors. Calgary was the first city in Canada to adopt PR for its city elections. Councillors were elected in one at-large district. Each voter cast just a single vote using a ranked transferable ballot. The UFA government elected in 1921 changed the provincial election law so that Calgary could elect its MLAs through PR as well. Calgary elected its MLAs through PR until 1956 and its councillors through PR until 1971 (although mostly using [[instant-runoff voting]], not STV, in the 1960s).<ref>Grofman, Elections in Australia, Ireland, and Malta Using STV</ref><ref>Monto, When Canada Had Proportional Representation (2021)</ref>

Calgary endured a six-year recession following the [[World War I|First World War]]. The high unemployment rate from reduced manufacturing demand, compounded with servicemen returning from Europe needing work, created economic and social unrest.{{sfn|Bright|1999|p=125}} By 1921, over 2,000 men (representing 11 percent of the male workforce) were officially unemployed.{{sfn|Bright|1999|p=130}} Labour organizations began endorsing candidates for Calgary City Council in the late 1910s and were quickly successful in electing sympathetic candidates to office, including Mayor [[Samuel Hunter Adams]] in [[1920 Calgary municipal election|1920]]. As well the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] and its sequel, [[One Big Union (Canada)|the One Big Union]], found much support among Calgary workers.

The city's support of labour and agricultural groups made it a natural location for the founding meeting of the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (precursor to the [[New Democratic Party]]). The organizational meeting was held in Calgary on July 31, 1932, with attendance exceeding 1,300 people.{{sfn|MacEwan|1975|p=169}} Pat Lenihan was elected to the Calgary City Council in 1939, in part due to the use of Proportional Representation in city elections. He is the only Communist Party member elected to Calgary council. (He is the subject of the book Patrick Lenihan from Irish Rebel to Founder of Canadian Public Sector Unionism, edited by Gilbert Levine (Athabasca University Press).)

In 1922, Civic Government Association formed in opposition to the power of labour groups, endorsing its own competing slate of candidates.{{sfn|Bright|1999|p=172}} Labour's influence was short-lived on the City Council, with Labour as a whole failing to receive substantial support after 1924.{{sfn|Bright|1999|p=178}}

[[File:Richard Bedford Bennett.jpg|thumb|right|Richard Bedford Bennett, the eleventh prime minister of Canada, and first prime minister from Calgary.]]
Calgary gained further political prominence when [[R. B. Bennett]]'s Conservative Party won the [[1930 Canadian federal election|1930 federal election]] and formed government and became Canada's [[Prime Minister of Canada|11th prime minister]].{{sfn|MacEwan|1975|p=165}} Bennett arrived in Calgary from [[New Brunswick]] in 1897, was previously the leader of the provincial Conservative Party, advocated for Calgary as the capital of Alberta, and championed the growing city.{{sfn|MacEwan|1975|pp=166-167}} Calgary had to wait another decade to have a sitting premier represent the city, when sitting [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit]] Premier [[William Aberhart]] moved from his [[Okotoks-High River]] to [[Calgary (provincial electoral district)|Calgary]] for the [[1940 Alberta general election|1940 provincial election]] after his Okotoks-High River constituents began a [[Recall election|recall]] campaign against him as their local MLA.

===1960s to 1970s===

[[File:Trolleybus next to Hudson's Bay Company store in Calgary in 1971.jpg|thumb|left|From the 1970s onward, the population of Calgary grew significantly, with many high-rises constructed to accommodate the growth.]]
Only a little over a decade after shuttering the municipal tram lines, Calgary City Council began investigating rapid transit. In 1966 a [[heavy rail transit]] proposal was developed, however the estimated costs continued to grow rapidly, and the plan was re-evaluated in 1975. In May 1977, Calgary City Council directed that a detailed design and construction start on the south leg of a [[light rail transit]] system,{{sfn|Reasons|1984|p=47}} which opened on May 25, 1981, and dubbed the [[CTrain]].

The [[University of Calgary]] gained autonomy as a degree-granting institution in 1966 with the passage of the ''Universities Act'' by the Alberta Legislature. The campus provided as a [[Peppercorn (legal)|one-dollar lease]] from the City of Calgary in 1957 had previously served as a [[satellite campus]] of the [[University of Alberta]].{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

===1970s and 1980s: economic boom and bust===

The [[1970s energy crisis]] resulted in significant investment and growth in Calgary. By 1981, 45 percent of the Calgary labour force was made up of management, administrative or clerical staff, above the national average of 35 percent.{{sfn|Reasons|1984|p=10}} Calgary's population grew with the opportunity the oil boom brought.

== Government ==
The city is a corporate power-centre with a high percentage of the workforce is employed in [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] jobs. The high concentration of oil and gas corporations led to the rise of [[Peter Lougheed]]'s [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservative Party]] in 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/calgary/1971poli.html |title=Calgary's Politics 1971–1991 |publisher=University of Calgary |year=1997 |access-date=June 28, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601065912/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/calgary/1971poli.html |archive-date=June 1, 2007 }}</ref> However, as Calgary's population has increased, so has the diversity of its politics.

=== Municipal politics ===
[[File:Calgary city hall1.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Calgary Municipal Building]] is the [[seat of local government]] for the City of Calgary. Attached to the building is the historic [[Calgary City Hall]] built in 1911.]]
The City of Calgary is a [[municipal corporation]] with a [[council–manager government]] structure consisting of a fifteen-member [[Calgary City Council|Council]] elected every four years. The Council itself consists of an at-large [[List of mayors of Calgary|Mayor]] and fourteen Councillors who represent geographic regions of the city. The legal authority to govern as a "creature of the province" is derived from various regulations and legislation of the [[Alberta Legislature]], of which the [[Municipal Government Act]] and the ''City of Calgary Charter, 2018 Regulation'' provide many of the powers and responsibilities for the city.<ref>{{cite web |title=Municipal Government Act, R.S.A. 2000 |url=http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/acts/m26.pdf |website=alberta.ca |publisher=Alberta Queen's Printer |access-date=March 21, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=City of Calgary Charter, 2018 Regulation AR 40/2018 |url=http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Regs/2018_040.pdf |website=alberta.ca |publisher=Alberta Queen’s Printer |access-date=March 21, 2020}}</ref> The current Mayor [[Jyoti Gondek]] was first elected in the [[2021 Calgary municipal election|2021 municipal election]].

Three school boards operate independently of each other in Calgary, the public, the separate (catholic) and francophone systems. Both the public and separate boards have 7 elected trustees each representing 2 of 14 wards. The School Boards are considered part of municipal politics in Calgary as they are elected at the same time as City Council.<ref>{{cite web|title=Election and Information Services|url=http://www.calgary.ca/election|publisher=City of Calgary|access-date=September 1, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714203720/http://www.calgary.ca/election/|archive-date=July 14, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

Calgary's first municipal political party, A Better Calgary, was established in June 2024, as a center-right group focused on common sense and fiscal responsibility. This followed the Alberta government's Bill 20, allowing municipal political parties in Calgary and Edmonton. Despite initial backlash against provisions that would have allowed the Premier to remove mayors and councillors, the pilot project for municipal political parties remained. Cheryl Munson, representing A Better Calgary, cited dissatisfaction with [[Jyoti Gondek]] as motivations for the party's formation. Although some members had ties to the [[United Conservative Party]], Munson clarified there were no formal links.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brown |first=Jim |title=Calgary's first municipal political party launches |date=June 19, 2024 |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/municipal-political-party-a-better-calgary-1.7240285 |access-date=June 20, 2024}}</ref>

As a result of the [[2023 Alberta general election|2023 provincial election]], Calgary is represented by 26 [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|MLAs]], comprising 14 members of the [[New Democratic Party of Alberta|New Democratic Party (NDP)]] and 12 members of the [[United Conservative Party|United Conservative Party (UCP)]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Election Results |url=http://www.elections.ab.ca/voters/voterlink/ |access-date=June 13, 2023 |website=Elections Alberta |language=en}}</ref>

=== Federal politics ===
Calgary is currently split between 10 ridings in the [[House of Commons of Canada]].

Historically, all or most of Calgary's federal seats have been held by the major centre-right party of the day, presently the [[Conservative Party of Canada]]. Before 2015, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] had only elected three MPs from Calgary ridings in their entire history-- [[Manley Justin Edwards|Manley Edwards]] (1940–1945),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=a0f8dbd6-a310-4dd8-a89a-5dcdd30f0517&Language=E |title=PARLINFO – Parliamentarian File – Federal Experience – EDWARDS, Manley Justin, LL.B. |work=parl.gc.ca |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220171316/http://www.parl.gc.ca/ParlInfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=a0f8dbd6-a310-4dd8-a89a-5dcdd30f0517&Language=E |archive-date=December 20, 2013 }}</ref> [[Harry Hays]] (1963–1965)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lop.parl.gc.ca/ParlInfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=457be46e-750a-4cf2-bbd6-699fdd7238b7&Language=E&Section=ALL|title=PARLINFO – Parliamentarian File – Complete File – HAYS, The Hon.

On October 19, 2015, Calgary elected its first two Liberal MPs since 1968, [[Darshan Kang]] for [[Calgary Skyview]] and [[Kent Hehr]] for [[Calgary Centre]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Two new Liberal MPs in Calgary are the first carrying the red banner in cowtown since 1968|url = http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/two-new-liberal-mps-in-calgary-are-the-first-carrying-the-red-banner-in-cowtown-since-1968|website = National Post|access-date = October 26, 2015|date = October 20, 2015|archive-url = https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20160319030504/http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian%2Dpolitics/two%2Dnew%2Dliberal%2Dmps%2Din%2Dcalgary%2Dare%2Dthe%2Dfirst%2Dcarrying%2Dthe%2Dred%2Dbanner%2Din%2Dcowtown%2Dsince%2D1968|archive-date = March 19, 2016|url-status = live}}</ref> The Tories held the other eight. The Tories won back Calgary Skyview and Calgary Centre in 2019, but the Liberals took back Calgary Skyview in 2021. No Liberal has ever held a Calgary-based riding for more than one term.

The federal riding of [[Calgary Heritage]] was held by former [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] and CPC leader [[Stephen Harper]]. That seat was also held by [[Preston Manning]], the leader of the [[Reform Party of Canada]]; it was known as [[Calgary Southwest]] at the time. Harper is the second Prime Minister to represent a Calgary riding; the first was [[R. B. Bennett]] from [[Calgary West]], who held that position from 1930 to 1935. [[Joe Clark]], former Prime Minister and former leader of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] (also a predecessor of the CPC), held the riding of [[Calgary Centre]] during his second stint in Parliament from 2000 to 2004.

The [[Green Party of Canada]] has also made inroads in Calgary, exemplified by results of the [[2011 Canadian federal election|2011 federal election]] where they achieved 7.7% of the vote across the city, ranging from 4.7% in [[Calgary Northeast]] to 13.1% in [[Calgary Centre-North]].<ref>[http://enr.elections.ca/DownloadResults.aspx Event results] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204034141/http://enr.elections.ca/DownloadResults.aspx |date=February 4, 2012 }} from Elections Canada</ref>

[[Calgary Transit]] provides public transportation services throughout the city with regular bus service, [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT), and [[light rail transit]] (LRT). Calgary's light rail system, known as the [[CTrain]], was one of the first [[Light rail in North America|such systems in North America]] (behind [[Edmonton LRT]]). It currently consists of two lines ([[Red Line (Calgary)|Red Line]] and [[Blue Line (Calgary)|Blue Line]]), with 44 stations and {{convert|58.2|km|abbr=on}} of track. Most of the CTrain runs on both dedicated tracks with partial grade separation across suburban areas, and a street-level section across downtown. The CTrain is one of the continent's busiest, carrying 270,000 passengers per weekday and approximately half of Calgary downtown workers take the transit to work. The CTrain is also North America's first and only rapid transit system to run on 100% renewable, [[Wind power|wind-generated]] energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/jun12/eco-conscious_communting2.asp|title=Eco-conscious commuting (page 2) – Canadian Geographic|work=canadiangeographic.ca|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903153650/http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/jun12/eco-conscious_communting2.asp|archive-date=September 3, 2014}}</ref> In early 2020, city council approved construction of the [[Green Line (Calgary)|Green Line]], the third light rail line in the city's rapid transit network.

[[File:Calgary +15 (28201581821).jpg|alt=|thumb|Calgary's [[+15]] [[skyway]] network is the world's most extensive elevated pedestrian skywalk system.]]

In the 1960s, Calgary started to develop a series of pedestrian bridges connecting many downtown buildings.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.calgary.ca/PDA/pd/Pages/Centre-City/Calgarys-Plus15-Skywalk.aspx |title=Calgary's +15 Skywalk |publisher=[[City of Calgary]] |year=2013 |access-date=November 28, 2013 |archive-date=December 25, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225234852/http://www.calgary.ca/PDA/pd/Pages/Centre-City/Calgarys-Plus15-Skywalk.aspx |url-status=dead |quote=The first +15 bridge was installed on January 21, 1970, connecting Calgary Place to the Calgary Inn (now the Westin Hotel). By 1984, Calgary's +15 Skywalk consisted of 38 bridges, {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} of walkways and numerous public spaces. Today there are more than 62 bridges and {{convert|18|km|0|abbr=on}} of walkways.}}</ref>

Today, these bridges connect between most of the city's downtown office towers and make up the world's most extensive [[skyway]] network (elevated indoor pedestrian bridges), officially called the [[+15]]. The system shields pedestrians from the city's extremely cold winter temperatures. The name derives from the fact that the bridges are usually {{convert|15|ft|abbr=on|order=flip}} above ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.calgary.ca/CCA/City+Living/Recreation+and+Leisure/Activities/Walking/Plus+15.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821194436/http://content.calgary.ca/CCA/City%2BLiving/Recreation%2Band%2BLeisure/Activities/Walking/Plus%2B15.htm|archive-date=August 21, 2007|title=Plus 15|author=The City of Calgary|date=February 2007|access-date=September 25, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Roads and highways====
Calgary lies at the crossroads of [[Alberta Highway 2|Highway&nbsp;2]] and the [[Alberta Highway 1|Trans-Canada Highway]], making it an important hub for the transit of goods across Canada and along the [[CANAMEX Corridor]]. [[Stoney Trail]] encircles the city, completing a full [[ring road]]. The last segment in west Calgary was completed in December 2023, and is now open to the public.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.alberta.ca/release.cfm?xID=89498F04A511D-FBBF-403E-0487060D79B49B3E  |title=Christmas comes early for Calgary drivers |date=December 18, 2023|access-date=January 11, 2024 }}</ref> Freeways and expressways are mostly called "trails".

 }}</ref> Roads in predominantly residential areas, as well as freeways and expressways, do not generally conform to the grid and are usually not numbered.

====Rail====
Calgary's presence along the Canadian Pacific Kansas City mainline (which includes the [[CPKC Alyth Yard]]) makes the city an important hub of freight rail throughout the province. There is no inter-city or regional passenger rail serving the city. In June 2020, the [[Canada Infrastructure Bank]] signed a memorandum of understanding with the [[Executive Council of Alberta|Government of Alberta]] to build a {{convert|130|km|adj=on}} inter-city rail line from downtown Calgary to Banff, and an express line from Calgary International Airport to downtown Calgary.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Calgary-Banff Rail|url=https://cib-bic.ca/en/projects/calgary-banff-rail/|access-date=September 3, 2020|website=Canada Infrastructure Bank - Banque de l'infrastructure du Canada|language=en-CA}}</ref> A {{convert|350|-|400|km/h|abbr=on}} [[high-speed rail]] line running from Downtown Calgary to Downtown Edmonton is planned as well. In July 2021, [[EllisDon]] signed a memorandum of understanding with the Government of Alberta to build the line, and it is expected to open sometime between 2030 and 2032.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Province on board with building high-speed Calgary-Edmonton rail link: developer|url=https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/province-on-board-with-building-high-speed-calgary-edmonton-rail-link-developer|access-date=July 29, 2021|website=calgaryherald|language=en-CA}}</ref>

Between 1955 and 1978, CPR operated a transcontinental passenger rail service called the ''[[Canadian (train)|Canadian]]'', running between Toronto and Vancouver via CPR's right-of-way through Calgary. In 1978, [[Via Rail]] assumed responsibility over CPR's Canadian rail service. In the aftermath of another round of deep budget cuts made to Via Rail on January 15, 1990, Via permanently discontinued the ''[[Super Continental]]'' and rerouted the Canadian along the ''Super Continental''{{'s}} [[Canadian National|CN]] route, bypassing Regina and Calgary in favour of Saskatoon and Edmonton. Since then, there has been no intercity rail service to or from Calgary. But two new rail-tour lines have opened along the CPR right-of-way: [[Rocky Mountaineer]] and [[Royal Canadian Pacific]]. The latter still operates rail-tour services to Calgary, while the former has terminated its westbound services at Banff, two hours to the west.
