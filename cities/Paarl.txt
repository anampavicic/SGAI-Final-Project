'''Paarl''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɑr|l}}; Afrikaans: {{IPA|af|ˈpɑːrl̩|}}; derived from ''Parel'', meaning "pearl" in Dutch<ref name=raper>{{citation |last=Raper |first=P. E. |title=Paarl |url=https://archive.org/stream/DictionaryOfSouthernAfricanPlaceNames/SaPlaceNames#page/n357/mode/2up |work=Dictionary of Southern African Place Names |access-date=28 October 2013}}</ref>) is a town with 285,574 inhabitants in the [[Western Cape]] province of [[South Africa]]. It is the largest town in the [[Cape Winelands]]. Due to the growth of the [[Mbekweni]] township, it is now a [[de facto]] [[urban unit]] with [[Wellington, Western Cape|Wellington]]. It is situated about {{convert|60|km|mi}} northeast of [[Cape Town]] in the [[Western Cape Province]] and is known for its scenic environment and [[viticulture]] and fruit-growing heritage.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Paarl is the seat of the [[Drakenstein Local Municipality]]; although not part of the Cape Town metropolitan area, it falls within its economic catchment. Paarl is unusual among South African place-names, in being pronounced differently in English than in Afrikaans; likewise unusual about the town's name is Afrikaners customary attachment to it, saying not  ''in Paarl'', but rather ''in die Paarl'', or ''in die Pêrel'' (literally, "in the Paarl").

Paarl gained additional international attention when, on 11 February 1990, [[Nelson Mandela]] walked, with live international television coverage, out of Victor Verster Correctional Centre (now known as [[Drakenstein Correctional Centre]]) in Paarl ending his 27 years of imprisonment, and beginning a course to South Africa's [[History of South Africa (1994–present)|post-apartheid era]] and, notably, to multi-racial elections.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/11/newsid_2539000/2539947.stm BBC on this Day 11 Feb 1990: Freedom of Nelson Mandela]</ref> Mandela spent three years in prison here living in a private house within the walls.  Today, a bronze statue of Mandela stands outside the prison.

Paarl hosted three matches of the [[ICC Cricket World Cup 2003]].  The headquarters of [[Ceres Fruit Juices]] is located in the city, although its namesake and source of much of the fruit, [[Ceres, Western Cape|Ceres]] Valley, lies around one hour's drive to the northeast.

The district is particularly well known for its Pearl Mountain or "Paarl Rock". This huge [[granite]] rock consists of three rounded outcrops. Paarl Rock consists of intrusive [[igneous rock]].

== History ==
The area that is now known as Paarl was first and is still inhabited by the [[Khoikhoi]].  The Peninsular Khoikhoi people and the Cocoqua people live in this area divided by the Berg River Valley.  The Cocoqua were cattle-herding people and among the richest of the Khoi tribes.  They had between 16,000 and 18,000 members and originally called Paarl Mountain, ''"!hom ǃnāb/s"'' which means Tortoise Mountain.<ref name="paarlonline.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.paarlonline.com/history.html |title=History of Paarl, Western Cape, South Africa |access-date=2011-03-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612112632/http://paarlonline.com/history.html |archive-date=12 June 2011 }}</ref>

The [[Dutch East India Company]], under the leadership of [[Jan van Riebeeck]], established meat-trading relationships with the Khoikhoi people on the [[Table Bay]] coastline.  In 1657, in search of new trading relationships inland, Abraham Gabemma saw a giant granite rock glistening in the sun after a rainstorm and named it "de Diamondt en de Peerlberg" (Diamond and Pearl Mountain), from which Paarl is derived.<ref name=raper/><ref name="Schirmer1980">''The concise illustrated South African Encyclopaedia.'' P. Schirmer, 1980. Central News Agency, Johannesburg. First edition, about 211pp</ref> Gabemma (often also spelt Gabbema) was the Fiscal (public treasurer) for the settlement on the shores of Table Bay. The "diamonds" disappeared from the name, and it became known simply as Pearl Rock or Pearl Mountain.

In 1687, Governor [[Simon van der Stel]] gave the title to the first colonial farms in the area to "free burghers". The following year, the French [[Huguenots]] arrived in the [[Western Cape]] and began to settle on farms in the area.<ref name="paarlonline.com"/> The fertile soil and the [[Mediterranean]]-like climate of this region provided perfect conditions for farming. The settlers planted [[orchards]], [[vegetable]] [[gardens]] and, above all, [[vineyards]].<ref name="Pinkerton">[https://books.google.com/books?id=xiEnAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA10 A General Collection of the Best and Most Interesting Voyages and Travels in All Parts of the World, Vol XVI.] John Pinkerton, 1814. London: Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Orme.</ref> Thus began Paarl's long and continuing history as a major wine- and fruit-producing area of South Africa.

In 1875 a congregation was formed out of a desire to be educated in their mother tongue. This was the result of a Reverend GWA van der Lingen idea who tried to motivate and convince people of his principles. The congregation would raise funds and begin construction of a church that would later be known as the "Toring Kerk" (Tower Church). Construction finished in 1905. The church contains materials imported from London and Egypt.<ref>NG Toringkerk pamphlet handed out by the church itself</ref>

The arrival of the European settlers brought on a conflict with the [[Khoikhoi]] people, as land and water resources began to be contested and the [[Khoi]] traditions of communal land use came in conflict with the settler's concept of private property.  The Khoi peoples were defeated in local war and were further decimated by European diseases. The population scattered inland toward the [[Orange River]] or became labourers on settler farms.<ref name="paarlonline.com"/>

==Demographics==
In the [[South African National Census of 2001|2001 census]] Paarl's population was recorded as being 82,713 people in 20,138 households, in a land area of {{convert|32.2|km2}}. A total of 67.8% of the inhabitants described themselves as "[[Coloured]]", 21.2% as "[[White South African|White]]", 10.5% as "[[Black African]]", and 0.5% as "[[Indian South African|Indian]] or [[Asian South African|Asian]]". Regarding language, 85.6% spoke [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] as their [[first language]], 8.5% spoke [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], and 5.2% spoke [[South African English|English]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://census.adrianfrith.com/place/10706 |title=Main Place 'Paarl' |work=Census 2001 |access-date=2 April 2011}}</ref>

Like many towns in the Cape Winelands, Paarl is home to many [[Cape Dutch architecture|Cape Dutch houses]], gardens and streets lined with old oak trees.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

Paarl was the place where the foundations of the [[Afrikaans language]] were laid by the [[Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners]]. The "[[Afrikaanse Taalmonument]]" (monument to the Afrikaans language) on the slopes of Paarl Mountain, the Language Museum (Taalmuseum) and the Afrikaans Language Route through Dal Josaphat are memorials to this achievement.

The former headquarters of the [[wine]] industry in South Africa is also situated here. This was the "Co-operative Wine Growers' Association" (better known by its Afrikaans initials KWV). [[KWV]] became a South African institution that has acquired an international reputation based on its unique achievements and its imprint of quality on the local wine industry. Over the past decade, however, KWV has been privatized and no longer has an administrative role in the South African wine industry. (KWV's main wine production and maturation facilities are on its Paarl premises, while its [[brandy]] production takes place in [[Worcester, Western Cape|Worcester]] and grape juice concentrate production in [[Upington]] in the [[Northern Cape]].)

Sights include Cape Dutch buildings (17-19th Century), scenic drives, hiking trails, excellent restaurants and the Paarl wine route, with its many [[wine tasting]] opportunities.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Things to do in Paarl {{!}} Paarl Directory|url = http://www.paarldirectory.co.za/|website = www.paarldirectory.co.za|access-date = 2016-02-29}}</ref>

The old [[Spice route paarl|Spice Route Paarl]], which was initiated in 1997 by [[Charles Back]], the owner of this estate as well as of [[Fairview Wine and Cheese|Fairview]], provides an opportunity for visitors to appreciate and taste local delicacies from the [[Western Cape]]. In addition to that, a range of art galleries and the traditional way of organic dark chocolate production can be explored. The heritage of the Spice Route farm goes back to the historical mariners who used to trade Eastern spices to Europe along the "Spice Route" for [[spice trade]] in the 15th century.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Swartland Revolution {{!}} Spice Route Winery|url = http://www.spiceroutewines.co.za/the-swartland-revolution/|website = www.spiceroutewines.co.za|access-date = 2015-08-18|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150921010649/http://www.spiceroutewines.co.za/the-swartland-revolution/|archive-date = 21 September 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref>

The Paarl Rock itself is these days a common destination for rock climbers.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} However, in the pioneering period of [[rock climbing]] in South Africa, the mountain was ignored or shunned because its steep faces were so smooth and unfissured that climbers could find no place to attach "runners" or anchor points for [[belay]]s. The first climbing routes up the rock were pioneered in 1969 by J. W. Marchant and G. Athiros, the former from the [[University of Cape Town]] Mountain and Ski Club. Soon afterwards Marchant and John Knight established a few routes on which the rope was run out for {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} or more with no protection whatsoever.<ref name="UCTMSC1970">''Annual Bulletin.'' University of Cape Town Mountain and Ski Club (UCTMSC), 1970.</ref> This was in the days before bolting was possible, and these achievements are still held in high regard today.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} Nowadays protection is afforded by bolts in the granite, and there are on Paarl Rock a few dozen routes that attract the best climbers of the current generation. {{citation needed|date=October 2021}} (All of these climbs remain dangerous for the inexperienced.){{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

==Districts==

Amongst the neighbourhoods are De Zoete Inval (a middle-class suburb in the south); Courtrai (a wealthy suburb in the southern part of town); Central Paarl (generally known as Upper-Paarl and also containing a lot of wealthy suburbs); Lemoenkloof (a wealthy suburb between the central and northern parts of town); Northern Paarl (middle-class suburb, including the area of Groenvlei); Denneburg (a middle class suburb) as well as Klein Parys (both in the south-east of the town); Vrykyk (in the south), Charleston Hill (east of the Railway line) and areas in the eastern part of the town such as New Orleans, New York, Amstelhof, Lantana and Klein Nederburg.

There are also large gated communities developed towards the South of the town on the way to Franschhoek, such as Boschenmeer (golf estate), [[Val de Vie Estate]] (polo estate) and Pearl Valley (golf estate).

==Education==

The town boasts some of the best known governmental academic high schools in the country including [[Paarl Gimnasium|Paarl Gimnasium High School]], [[La Rochelle Girls' High School]], [[Paarl Boys' High School]], [[Paarl Girls’ High School]], Boland Agricultural High, Paulus Joubert High, Noorder Paarl High School, New Orleans Secondary and Klein Nederburg Secondary. Paarl Girls' High was placed 17th in the National Senior Certificate's "Excellence in academic performance" awards in 2012. New Orleans Secondary is the school where the Miss South Africa (2018), Tamaryn Green, completed her secondary education. Independent schools such as Simond Private School (est. 1852) and Bridge House also feature in this region. Bridge House, listed as one of the most expensive independent schools in South Africa, offers boarding facilities. These schools offer the [[Independent Examinations Board|IEB]] examinations as distinct from the [[National Senior Certificate]] offered by government schools.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/docs/2013/wc_top_schools.pdf |title=Western Cape Education Department National Senior Certificate (NSC) Awards for 2012 |access-date=2013-06-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612210657/http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/docs/2013/wc_top_schools.pdf |archive-date=12 June 2013 }}</ref>

== Transport ==
The [[N1 (South Africa)|N1 national highway]] is the main [[freeway]] intersecting Paarl, running south of the city from the city of [[Cape Town]] in the south-west to [[Worcester, South Africa|Worcester]] and further onwards to [[Bloemfontein]], [[Johannesburg]] and [[Pretoria]] in the north-east intersecting four on and off-ramp interchanges within Paarl including the R45 Main Road (Exit 55), Cecilia Street (Exit 57), R301 Jan van Riebeeck Drive (Exit 59) and Sonstraal Road (Exit 62) interchanges.

As a regional hub, Paarl is located at the centre of three [[Regional routes (South Africa)|regional routes]] including the [[R45 (South Africa)|R45]] (Main Road) which runs from [[Franschhoek]] and [[Villiersdorp]] in the south-west to [[Malmesbury, South Africa|Malmesbury]] and [[Vredenburg]] in the Cape West Coast which is to the north-west. The [[R101 (South Africa)|R101]] (Main Road; Market Street; Langenhoven Avenue) runs from [[Klapmuts]] and [[Kraaifontein]] in the south-west, passing through Paarl and climbing over the [[Du Toitskloof Mountains]] as [[Du Toitskloof Pass]] to join the N1 to Worcester. The R101 was the original N1 and served the same function before the construction of the highway. The [[R301 (South Africa)|R301]] (Jan van Riebeeck Drive) runs from [[Franschhoek]] (via the R45) in the south-west to [[Mbekweni]] and [[Wellington, South Africa|Wellington]] in the north and over the [[Bainskloof Pass]] to [[Ceres, South Africa|Ceres]] in the north-west (via the [[R43 (South Africa)|R43]]).

==Coats of arms==
'''Municipality (1)''' — On 18 July 1905, the municipal council accepted a coat of arms presented by {{Interlanguage link|Adriaan Moorrees|af}}.<ref name=paarl1>Western Cape Archives : Paarl Municipal Minutes (18 July 1905).</ref> It was the arms of Hendrik van Reede van Drakenstein : a silver shield charged with two dancetty black bars and crowned with a golden coronet.  The supporters were two golden gryphons.  The motto was ''Pour le salut du peuple'' ("For the wellbeing of the people").  Sometimes, the [http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Paarl arms] were depicted as silver dancetty bars on a blue shield.

[[File:Paarl CoA 2.svg|thumb|83px|right|Paarl coat of arms (1951)]]
'''Municipality (2)''' — The arms were re-designed in 1950 by [[Colin Graham Botha]], and granted by the [[College of Arms]] on 22 January 1951.  They were published in the Cape Province's ''Official Gazette'' in 1955, re-granted by the provincial administrator in 1967, and certified by the [[Bureau of Heraldry]] in 1969.<ref name=boh>[http://www.national.archsrch.gov.za/sm300cv/smws/sm300dl National Archives of South Africa : Data of the Bureau of Heraldry]</ref>

In the new version, each of the dancetty bars on the shield displayed two pearls; the supporters were red with blue wings dotted with golden fleurs de lis; and the crest was a red demi-gryphon with blue wings holding a bunch of grapes.

'''Divisional Council''' — The divisional council was the local authority which administered the rural areas outside the town.  It registered a coat of arms at the Bureau of Heraldry on 20 October 1978.  Once again, the Van Reede shield formed the basis of the design.  Down the middle of the shield was a red pale displaying a bunch of grapes between two pearls.  The crest was a fleur de lis.  The motto was ''Animus et fata'' ("Courage and fortune").<ref name=boh />

'''Mbekweni''' — The local authority for the predominantly Black township of Mbekweni, which borders with Wellington, registered arms at the Bureau on 5 May 1989.  The shield is divided per chevron into red and green, with a golden chevron rompu across the centre and a silver cross pommy below it.  Above the arms was a green mural crown decorated with a band of red edged in gold.  The motto was ''uXolo neMpulelelo''.<ref name=boh />
