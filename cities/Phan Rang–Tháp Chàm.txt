==Etymology==
Phan Rang – Tháp Chàm is the city with the longest name in [[Vietnam]]. The name ''Phan Rang'' or in modern [[Cham language|Cham]]: ꨚꩃꨕꨣꩃ ''Pan(da)rang'' is an indigenous [[Chamic languages|Chamized]] form of the original [[Sanskrit]] ''Pāṇḍuraṅga'' (another epithet for the Hindu god [[Vithoba]]).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dokras |first=Dr Uday |date=1 January 2022 |title=The Ancient City of PANDURANGA in Vietnam |url=https://www.academia.edu/84531020/The_Ancient_City_of_PANDURANGA_in_Vietnam |journal=Indo Nordic Author's Collective}}</ref> It first appeared on [[Cham script|Cham]] inscriptions around the tenth century as ''Paṅrauṅ'' or ''Panrāṅ'',<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Griffiths |first1=Arlo |last2=Lepoutre |first2=Amandine |last3=Southworth |first3=William A. |last4=Phần |first4=Thành |date=2009 |title=Études du corpus des inscriptions du Campa III, Épigraphie du Campa 2009-2010.

==History==
{{Main|Panduranga (Champa)}}

What is now Phan Rang was formerly known as '''Panduranga''', a principality of [[Champa|Champa kingdom]].
[[File:Territory of Panduranga.jpg|left|thumb|130x130px|The territory of Panduranga with its capital Phan Rang]]
In 757, the southern [[Champa]] polity of [[Panduranga (Champa)|Panduranga]] was founded with local autonomy granted by the [[King of Champa|Champa king]]. Phan Rang then quickly rose as its religious and cultural center. Following the [[Đại Việt|Dai Viet]] attack on [[Vijaya (Champa)|Vijaya]] in 1471, Panduranga became the Champa kingdom's capital, serving in this role until 1693. The [[Principality of Thuận Thành|Panduranga Principality]] was annexed by the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] in 1832, marking the fall of the last Champa Kingdom.

The town of Phan Rang was established in 1917 during the [[Nguyễn dynasty]], by edict of Emperor [[Khải Định]], and remained the provincial capital of [[Ninh Thuận Province]] until 1976, when the province merged with [[Bình Thuận Province]] to form [[Thuận Hải Province]].

When the Japanese occupied the country in [[World War II]], they established an airfield and it was later used by the French. During the [[Republic of Vietnam]], Phan Rang was the site of the [[United States Air Force]]'s [[Phan Rang Air Base]] in the [[Vietnam War]].

The town was divided into Phan Rang in the east, which became part of [[Ninh Hải District]] and Tháp Chàm in the west, which became part of An Son district. The two were again combined in 1992 to become Phan Rang–Tháp Chàm, the capital of Ninh Thuận Province, achieving city status in 2007.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brief history of Phan Rang - Thap Cham City |url=https://prtc.ninhthuan.gov.vn/portal/Pages/2021-12-23/So-luoc-lich-su-Thanh-pho-Phan-Rang--Thap-Cham-0lim61.aspx |access-date=3 November 2023 |website=prtc.ninhthuan.gov.vn |language=en-us}}</ref>

* The west borders [[Ninh Sơn district|Ninh Son district]].
* The south borders [[Ninh Phước district|Ninh Phuoc district]]

[[File:Nuôi tôm thẻ công nghiệp tại Đông Hải, Phan Rang.jpg|thumb|Industrial shrimp farming in Đông Hải, Phan Rang]]

==Culture==
===Cham===
Phan Rang–Tháp Chàm city has become a center for the maintenance of Cham culture. Much of the city is occupied by [[Chams|Cham people]] where they have rice paddies, orchards of grapes and peaches, flocks of goats and [[Brahman cattle]].Their towers (the 'Thap') are beautiful memorials to their kings and queens. There are several Cham sites with dilapidated towers along the central coast of Vietnam and major sites in [[Mỹ Sơn]] and [[Nha Trang]].

However, there are two sites in the Phan Rang–Tháp Chàm being maintained and culturally active. Two kilometers west of the [[Tháp Chàm Railway Station]], there is excellent hilltop Cham tower complex dedicated to the king [[Po Klong Garai]], the last reigning king; his likeness is depicted on a [[lingam]] in the sanctuary of the central tower. A second tower for the king [[Po Re Do]] is located about 20&nbsp;km south west of Tháp Chàm, via Phu Quy to Phuoc Hou and the village Hau Sanh; this tower is undergoing extensive renovation (July 2012).

The towers are currently used for the very colorful Cham festivals, particularly "'''Kate festival'''" in October (15 Oct in 2012) when they still sacrifice a bullock and other food offerings. Other ceremonies for [[Ramadan]], a Rain Festival (as required), weddings and other celebrations are also held. Apart from the incorporation of Islam into their cultural and religious practice, another point of cultural difference is that their heredity line is maternal. The animist foundation of Cham culture, with fire motif on the towers, rustic traditions and very colorful ceremonial dress makes the Cham culture an ideal tourist resource for Vietnam, as yet poorly developed.
[[File:Cổng vào Bảo tàng Văn hóa Dân tộc Chăm - Panduranga (Phan Rang).jpg|thumb|Entrance gate to Po Klong Garai temple during Kate festival (2023)]]
Architecturally, the towers are intricately built in small red bricks, almost dry stone construction with very fine mortar lines. The towers are topped by calyx like minarets, arches are rimmed by special bricks fired with tongue like extensions on the extremities to represent flames; it is very intricate brick work requiring sophisticated engineering to deal with the overhang.

Associated with the Po Klong Garai complex there is a cultural center, more functionally built with concrete, bricks, mortar and render, but at least with some of the line of the Cham architecture and housing a display of cultural and handi-works, and excellent photographs and paintings by Cham artists.{{wide image|Phang Rang, Vietnam.jpg|1000px|Phan Rang Look Out}}
