It is administratively a [[prefecture-level city]], about {{convert|300|km|abbr=on}} east of Beijing, on the [[Bohai Sea]], the innermost gulf of the [[Yellow Sea]]. Its population during the [[Seventh National Population Census of the People's Republic of China|2020 national census]] was 3,136,879, with 1,881,047 people living in the built-up (or 'metro') area made up of four urban districts.

==History==
The city's name "''Qinhuangdao''" literally means "[[Qin Shi Huang|Qin Emperor]] island", and is allegedly originated from the legend that the Jieshishan [[National Scenic Area (People's Republic of China)|Scenic Area]] in [[Changli County]] was the site of [[First Emperor of Qin]]'s famous ritual during his fourth and final survey tour to the east (东巡) in 210 BC. The "island" refers to the Nanshan area of the [[Port of Qinhuangdao]] at the southern edge of the city's [[Haigang District]], which used to be a small offshore island until the late [[Qing dynasty]], when dumping of [[dredging|dredged]] [[silt]] [[land reclamation|joined it to the mainland]] after the [[Guangxu Emperor]] approved the port's construction in the late 19th century.

In the 19th century, Qinhuangdao included the separate towns of '''Qinhuangdao''' and '''Tanghe'''.<ref group=n>{{zh|t=湯河 |s=汤河 |p=Tānghé |w=Tang-ho |l=soup river}}</ref> Both were stations along the [[Peking–Mukden Railway]]. The design and construction of the new harbour and port of Ching Wang Tao in the Gulf of Pechili was undertaken by the partnership of Sir [[John Wolfe-Barry]] and Lt Col [[Arthur John Barry]] at the turn of the 20th century.<ref>Frederick Arthur Crisp ''Visitation of England and Wales'', Volume 14, London (1906)</ref>

At the beginning of the [[Chinese Civil War]], [[Du Yuming]]'s [[National Revolutionary Army]] forces landed in the city at the beginning of the [[Nationalist government]]'s offensive against the [[Chinese Communist Party]] in [[Soviet-occupied Manchuria]]. They were unable to land further north because other ports were either occupied by the Soviet Union or already garrisoned by the military forces which would become the [[People's Liberation Army]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Dikötter |first=Frank |title=The Tragedy of Liberation: A History of the Chinese Revolution, 1945-1957 |date=2013 |publisher=Bloomsbury Press |isbn=978-1-62040-347-1 |edition=1 |location=London |pages=14–15}}</ref>

[[Qinhuangdao Olympic Sports Center Stadium]] was used as one of the soccer [[Venues of the 2008 Summer Olympics|venues]] during the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].

==Geography==
Qinhuangdao sits on the northwest coast of the [[Bohai Sea]] and borders [[Tangshan]] to the southwest, [[Chengde]] to the northwest, and [[Liaoning]] to the northeast. Its administrative area ranges in latitude 39° 24' to 40° 37' N and in longitude from 118° 33' to 119° 51' E, and has a total area of {{convert|7812.4|km2|abbr=on}}.

Since the elevation of [[Tianjin]] to a [[municipality of China|provincial-level municipality]], Qinhuangdao is the chief port of Hebei. The [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] is said to have sought immortality on an island in [[Haigang District]] but did not find it.

Qinhuangdao has three main developed areas:
* [[Beidaihe]]: A summer seaside resort for senior government officials. Many political decisions affecting China are made here, making it the equivalent to resorts in [[Maine]] or [[Camp David]] in [[Maryland]], United States.{{Globalize-inline|United States|date=February 2023}}<ref name="China Expat City Guide">{{cite web|title=China Expat City Guide |url=http://www.chinaexpat.com/front-page |publisher=Asia Briefing |year=2009 |access-date=February 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118101646/http://www.chinaexpat.com/front-page |archive-date=January 18, 2009 }}</ref>
* [[Haigang District|Haigang]]: the harbor city. Qinhuangdao proper. Home of [[Yan Shan University]], the leading university in NE Hebei province.
* [[Shanhai Pass|Shanhaiguan]]: a popular tourist destination, featuring the eastern end of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]].

Qinhuangdao's Olympic Sports Centre Stadium was used as an Olympic Competition Venue (Football Preliminary) during the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].

===Climate===
Qinhuangdao has a [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dwa''), with four distinct seasons. Winters are cold and dry due to the [[Siberian high]], which often causes winds to blow in from the northwest, minimising the oceanic influence: the monthly daily average temperature in January is {{convert|−5.6|°C|1}}, colder than Beijing's {{convert|−2.7|°C|1}}.<ref name=CMA>{{cite web

==Development Zone==
The Qinhuangdao Economic & Technology Development Zone was approved by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] in 1984 to become one of China's first state-level [[National Economic and Technological Development Zones|economic and technological development zones]]. Qinhuangdao is in the heart of the rapidly growing "Bohai-Rim Economic Circle", in easy reach of Beijing ({{convert|280|km|abbr=on}}) and Tianjin ({{convert|245|km|abbr=on}}).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Qinhuangdao Economic & Technology Development Zone |url=http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/qinhuangdao-economic-technology-development-zone/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801011258/http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/qinhuangdao-economic-technology-development-zone |archive-date=August 1, 2012 |access-date=December 24, 2012 |website=RightSite.asia}}</ref> It covers a sea area of {{convert|23.81|km2|abbr=on}} and has a coastline of {{convert|6|km|abbr=on}}. The planned and controlled area of the development zone has reached {{convert|56.72|km2|abbr=on}}. By the end of 2006, the number of approved projects reached 4,546, in which 647 projects were foreign-invested, with a total investment of US$4.73&nbsp;billion.

Qinhuangdao [[Export Processing Zone]] is the first export processing zone in Hebei Province. It passed joint appraisal held by the [[General Administration of Customs]], the [[State Development Planning Commission]], and other six departments in 2003. Industries encouraged in the zone include electronics assembly and manufacturing, building/construction materials, computer software, trading and distribution.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Qinhuangdao Export Processing Zone |url=http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/qinhuangdao-export-processing-zone/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801011318/http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/qinhuangdao-export-processing-zone |archive-date=August 1, 2012 |access-date=December 24, 2012 |website=RightSite.asia}}</ref>

[[Qinhuangdao Port]] is a strategically important port and is the largest coal shipping port in the country, much of which is shipped to [[power plant]]s elsewhere in China. With recent expansion, its capacity has reached 209 million metric tons. The harbor is adding a further six berths to add capacity and is increasingly being invested in by other port operators, such as South Africa's [[Port of Richards Bay]], who have announced plans to invest US$150&nbsp;million to increase capacity by at least 28 percent.

China is the world's third largest [[Coal in China|coal exporter]], and Qinhuangdao is expected to handle much of the nation's coal exports. Rail links from [[Shanxi]] (China's largest coal producer) to Qinhuangdao Port are being upgraded, which should allow for Qinhuangdao to ultimately increase its throughput to 400 million tonnes of coal per annum from its current level of about 250&nbsp;million tons by 2015. In 2018, the updated railway reached a record annual throughput of 451 million tons.<ref>{{Cite web |title="中国重载第一路"大秦铁路2023年货运量超4亿吨-中新网 |url=https://www.chinanews.com.cn/cj/2024/01-04/10140410.shtml |access-date=2024-01-29 |website=www.chinanews.com.cn}}</ref>

Other Chinese and foreign service suppliers are moving to Qinhuangdao to support this. [[China Ocean Shipping]] (Group) Co, China's biggest shipping company, expects US$49&nbsp;billion of spending on ports over the next five years as the industry tackles bottlenecks created by the nation's unprecedented economic boom.<ref name="China Briefing Business Guide">{{Cite web |year=2009 |title=China Briefing Business Guide |url=http://www.china-briefing.com/download.php?download_file=ChinaBriefing_200807_EN.pdf |access-date=February 8, 2009 |publisher=China Briefing}}{{Dead link|date=November 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
