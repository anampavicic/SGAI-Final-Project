'''Libreville''' is the capital and largest city of [[Gabon]], located on the [[Gabon Estuary]]. Libreville occupies {{convert|65|km2|sqmi|abbr=}} of the northwestern province of [[Estuaire Province|Estuaire]]. Libreville is also a [[port]] on the Gabon Estuary, near the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. As of the 2013 census, its population was 703,904.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geohive.com/cntry/gabon.aspx|title=GeoHive – Gabon|date=2015-10-22|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906035204/http://www.geohive.com/cntry/gabon.aspx|archive-date=6 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The area has been inhabited by the [[Mpongwe people]] since before the French acquired the land in 1839. It was later an [[United States|American]] Christian [[Christian mission|mission]], and a slave resettlement site, before becoming the chief port of the colony of [[French Equatorial Africa]]. By the time of Gabonese independence in 1960, the city was a [[trading post]] and minor [[administrative centre]] with a population of 32,000. Since 1960, Libreville has grown rapidly and now is home to one-third of the national population.

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Libreville}}
[[File:082 Gabon. - L'entrée de Libreville.jpg|thumb|left|The entrance to Libreville, 1899]]
Various native peoples lived in or used the area that is now Libreville before colonization, including the [[Mpongwé]] tribe. French admiral [[Édouard Bouët-Willaumez]] negotiated a trade and protection treaty with the local Mpongwé ruler, Antchoué Komé Rapontcombo (known to the French as King Denis), in 1839.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gabon |url=https://lionkingmagazine.ubagroup.com/2017c/files/assets/basic-html/page26.html |website=The Lion King Magazine |access-date=12 October 2022 |pages=26 |date=July–September 2017}}</ref>

American missionaries from New England established a mission in Baraka, Gabon, on what is now Libreville, in 1842. In 1846, the Brazilian slave ship ''L'Elizia'', carrying slaves from the Congo, was captured near Loango by the French navy which was tasked with contributing to the British [[Blockade of Africa]]. Fifty-two of the freed slaves were resettled on the site of Libreville (French for "Freetown") in 1849.<ref>Britannica,
[https://www.britannica.com/place/Libreville Libreville], britannica.com, USA, accessed on June 30, 2019</ref> Following the [[French Revolution of 1848]] and establishment of the [[French Second Republic]], the former slaves organized an election to select leaders of the new village in 1849. A former slave named Mountier was elected Mayor of Libreville.<ref>{{cite web |title=Historique de la Ville |url=http://www.libreville.ga/historique-de-la-ville#.Y0bxXXbMKUl |website=Mairie de Libreville |access-date=12 October 2022 |date=13 November 2012}}</ref> Libreville was the administrative capital of France's Congo-Gabon colony between 1888 and 1904, when the capital moved to [[Brazzaville]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Historique de la Ville |url=http://www.libreville.ga/historique-de-la-ville#.Y0bxXXbMKUl |website=Mairie de Libreville |access-date=12 October 2022 |date=13 November 2012}}</ref>

In 1910, Gabon became part of [[French Equatorial Africa]] (''Afrique équatoriale française'', AEF). French companies were allowed to exploit the [[Middle Congo]] (modern-day Congo-Brazzaville). It soon became necessary to build a railroad that would connect [[Brazzaville]], the terminus of the river navigation on the [[Congo River]] and the [[Ubangi River]], with the Atlantic coast. As [[rapids]] make it impossible to navigate on the Congo River past Brazzaville, and the coastal railroad terminus site had to allow for the construction of a deep-sea port, authorities chose the site of Ponta Negra instead of Libreville as originally envisaged. Construction of the [[Congo–Ocean Railway]] began in 1921, and Libreville was surpassed by the rapid growth of [[Pointe-Noire]], farther down the coast. {{citation needed|date=October 2021}} Libreville received its first bank branch when [[Bank of West Africa (BAO)]] opened a branch in 1930. In 1940, Libreville was the central focus of the [[Battle of Gabon]] as [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s [[Free France|Free French]] forces, supported by the Royal Navy, moved to consolidate control over French Equatorial Africa.<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 154</ref>

With national independence on the horizon, [[Léon M'ba]] won Libreville's first free mayoral election in 1956.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Zuber |first1=David |title=LÉON M'BA (1902-1967) |url=https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/people-global-african-history/leon-mba-1902-1967/ |access-date=12 October 2022 |date=31 March 2022}}</ref> Mba was later the first president of independent Gabon. The city's population was only 32,000 at independence, but grew rapidly thereafter. It now houses one-third of the national population.

== Geography ==
[[File:Libreville, Gabon.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Satellite view of Libreville]]
[[File:Playing by the coastline in Libreville.jpg|thumb|250px|Beach in Libreville]]
From north to south, major districts of the city are the [[residential]] area [[Batterie IV]], [[Quartier Louis]] (known for its [[Nightlife (activity)|nightlife]]), [[Mont-Bouët]] and [[Nombakélé]] (busy commercial areas), [[Glass, Gabon|Glass]] (the first European settlement in Gabon), [[Oloumi]] (a major industrial area) and [[Lalala (Libreville)|Lalala]], a residential area. The city's port and train station on the [[Trans-Gabon Railway]] line to [[Franceville]] lie in [[Owendo]], south of the main built-up area. Inland from these districts lie poorer residential areas. North-west of Equatorial Guinea is where the city stands, labeling the city as a part of north-west Gabon. In terms of the country's surrounding boundaries, north is [[Cameroon]], east is [[Republic of Congo|Congo]], and south-east is the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. It also rides the shores of the South Atlantic Ocean, which is on the country's west coast for reference. Additionally, in terms of aquatic geography, the Komo River passes through the city and empties into the ocean. The [[Komo River]] also stands as a potential hydroelectric source of power for the city which could generate supportive amounts of energy and power. Several city districts provide distinct and separate benefits throughout the city as well. In terms of nightlife, the Quartier Louis sector is most renowned. One of this zone's sides includes the coast, and this heavily influences the possible activities available in the area. Commercial areas within Libreville are housed in the Mont-Bouët and Nombakélé districts, which feature several shopping centers and stations selling purchasable goods. Oloumi contains much of the city's industry, integrating production separately from the districts that focus upon other aspects. Finally, Lalala and Batterie IV are residential and housing sectors, where much of the populace resides.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.libreville.com/v/geography/|title=Libreville Geography – Information, climate and weather in Libreville|work=libreville.com}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
Libreville features a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Am]]) with a lengthy [[wet season]] and a short [[dry season]]. The city's [[wet season]], which is also its autumn, winter and spring, spans about nine months (September through May), with a great deal of rain falling during these months. Its [[dry season]] (or summer) lasts from June through August, and is caused by the cold [[Benguela Current]] reaching its northernmost extent and suppressing rainfall. Despite the lack of rain, Libreville remains very cloudy during this time of year.

As is common with many cities with this climate, average temperatures remain relatively constant throughout the course of the year, with average high temperatures at around {{convert|29|°C|°F}}.
