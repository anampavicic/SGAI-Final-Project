'''Shinyanga Region''' (''Mkoa wa Shinyanga'' in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]) is one of [[Tanzania]]'s 31 administrative [[Regions of Tanzania|regions]]. The region covers a land area of {{cvt|18,555|km2}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shinyanga.go.tz/history|title=Shinyanga Region Size}}</ref> The region is comparable in size to the combined land area of the nation state of [[Fiji]].<ref>{{Convert|18,274|km2|abbr=on}} for Fiji at {{cite web|url=https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/countries_by_area.htm|title= Area size comparison| publisher=Nations Online| year=2022| access-date=14 January 2023}}</ref> The region is bordered to the north by the [[Mwanza Region|Mwanza]], [[Mara Region|Mara]], and [[Kagera Region|Kagera]] Regions and to the south by the [[Tabora Region]]. The [[Kigoma Region]] borders the region to the west,  and the [[Simiyu Region]] and a sliver of [[Singida Region]] to the east. The regional capital is the municipality of [[Shinyanga]]. According to the 2022 national census, the region had a population of 2,241,299.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tanzania: Regions and Cities - Population Statistics, Maps, Charts, Weather and Web Information |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/tanzania/cities/ |access-date=2024-02-09 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Tanzania country profile|url=http://www.clgf.org.uk/default/assets/File/Country_profiles/Tanzania.pdf|url-status=live|access-date=2022-12-20|archive-date=2021-08-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210831184708/http://www.clgf.org.uk/default/assets/File/Country_profiles/Tanzania.pdf}}</ref>

==Geography==
The Shinyanga region, which once belonged to the [[Sukumaland|Sukuma]] territory, is situated 20 to 160 kilometres south of [[Lake Victoria]]. The area is located between 2 and 3 degrees Southern latitude and 31 and 35 Eastern longitude. In the northwestern region of [[Tanzania]], it is a component of the Lake Zone. [[Kigosi Game Reserve|Kigosi National Park]] is located on the western border with Geita Region. The western and southern regions follow lakes and sand river flows.<ref>{{Cite web | date= July 2007 | title= Shinyanga Region Social-Economic Profile | publisher= The Regional Commissioner's Office, Shinyanga| url=http://www.tzonline.org/pdf/shinyanga_profile.pdf|access-date=2023-01-14}}</ref>

The average temperature of Shinyanga is 23.9°C. Throughout the year, October has the hottest average temperature (26.0 °C), while July has the coldest average temperature (22.3 °C).<ref name="Guide2020">{{Cite web | date= 2020 | title= Shinyanga Investment Guide 2020 | publisher= The Regional Commissioner's Office, Shinyanga| url=https://shinyanga.go.tz/storage/app/uploads/public/616/837/f86/616837f86a5c5448770569.pdf|access-date=2023-01-14}}</ref>
===Topography===
Shinyanga Region is located at an average height of 1,233 meters above sea level. Heavy [[clay]] soil, sandy soil, sandy loam soil, red soils, clay, loamy soil, and sand loamy soil are all types of soil found in the region. In the Shinyanga Region, the soil varies greatly by agro-ecological zone.<ref name="Guide2020"/>

Four distinct [[Biodiversity in agriculture|agro-ecological]] zones are established within the Shinyanga Region mostly based on topographical factors and local meteorological conditions. Parts of [[Kishapu District]] and a few wards in [[Shinyanga Rural District|Shinyanga District]] Council are included in the eastern zone. Sandalized soils and thick clay soils are features of the Eastern Zone. The region is known for the growing [[cotton]], [[sorghum]], [[sweet potato]]es, and [[sisal]] and receives an average annual rainfall between 400mm and 600mm.<ref name="Guide2020"/>

Some of the Kishapu District Council and Shinyanga District Council are included in the Central Zone. [[Usule Ward|Usule]], Tinde, Usanda, and Imasela are among the wards in  Shinyanga District Council, and Itongoitale, Bunambiyu, and Bubiki are among those in the Kishapu District Council. This region is suited for the growth of crops such [[Paddy field|paddy]], [[cassava]], sorghum, and sweet potatoes and receives an average annual rainfall of 500 to 600 mm.<ref name="Guide2020"/>

The Ushetu and Uyogo wards in [[Kahama Rural District|Kahama District]] fall under the purview of the South-East zone, which is distinguished by loamy and red soils that are ideal for the cultivation of crops like maize, sorghum, paddy, [[sunflower]], cotton, [[tobacco]], and a variety of [[horticulture]] products, including tropical fruits like [[mango]]es. Over 700 millimeters of rain fall on average annually in this area.<ref name="Guide2020"/>

Isaka, Kinanga, Lungunya, and Kinaga wards of the Kahama District are included in this zone. Sand and heavy clay soils in the region are suited for sorghum, sweet potatoes, maize, cotton, [[Peanut|groundnuts]], and sunflowers. The annual rainfall in this area ranges from 500 to 700 mm. Large [[Miombo]] and [[acacia]] woods make up the area's native vegetation. However, human activities like as farming, raising livestock, and harvesting trees for energy are causing a decline in vegetation.<ref name="Guide2020"/>

==Economy==
[[Agriculture]], [[livestock]], and [[mining]] are the key economic drivers of the Shinyanga Region. From around 3.75 trillion [[Tanzanian shilling|shillings]] in 2012 to approximately TSh&nbsp;7.54 trillion in 2018, the regional GDP has been continuously rising at current market values. At current market values, the regional GDP per capita climbed from TSh&nbsp;1,124,625/= in 2012 to TSh&nbsp;1,861,770/= in 2018. Overall, primary productive industries. in Shinyanga include agricultural, equine, forestry, mining, and heavy industry.<ref name="Guide2020"/>

===Agriculture===
The economic foundation of Shinyanga Region is agriculture. 80 per cent of the labour force in the area is employed in this sector. Both food and cash crops are produced in the area. Agriculture is still largely reliant on traditional [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence]] [[Rainfed agriculture|rain-fed]] farming techniques, animal husbandry, and the traditional hand hoe and [[Cart|animal-driven carts]]. The continued low level of agricultural output is implied, among other things, by the usage of traditional agricultural inputs.<ref name="Guide2020"/>

====Subsistance agriculture====
Due to the drought of 2016–2017, crop production was low, leading to food shortages and rising food prices. The most important food crop is paddy, which is also a source of income, followed by maize (10.6%), sweet potatoes (4.7%), sorghum (1.5%), and Bulrush millet (0.3%).<ref name="Guide2020"/>

====Commercial agriculture====
In the Shinyanga Region, major cash crops include cotton, tobacco, chickpeas, and sunflower. Other crops include [[cashew nuts]], which Ushetu District Council has just begun to cultivate, and sisal, which is farmed in Kishapu District Council. Cotton (29.1% of total production) is the most important cash crop in Shinyanga, followed by green peas (21.2%), chickpeas (17.7%), and sunflower (15.7%). The Shinyanga Region's cash crop output trend from 2015/2016 to 2017/2018.<ref name="Guide2020"/>

There are 221,896 hectares in the Shinyanga Region available for irrigation. Only 4,899 hectares, or 2.2 per cent, of the total land area is currently irrigated. In addition to paddy and maize, horticultural crops like as [[tomato]]es, [[onion]]s, [[cabbage]]s, [[eggplant]], [[watermelon]]s, and [[capsicum]]s are also grown under irrigation by small business farms.<ref name="Guide2020"/>

====Livestock and dairy====
In the Shinyanga Region, [[Sukuma people|Sukuma]] traditional methods are primarily used for livestock keeping. [[Cattle]], [[goat]]s, [[sheep]], [[donkey]]s, [[pig]]s, [[chicken]]s, and [[camel]]s are all examples of livestock raised in the region. At the [[homesteading|homestead]] level, the livestock subsector significantly aids in reducing poverty and ensuring food security in the region.
Shinyanga Region's livestock population was expected to be 4,742,367 in 2018, with cattle making up 26% of the region's overall livestock population.<ref name="Guide2020"/>

===Mining===
The country's production of [[mineral]]s is significantly influenced by the Shinyanga Region. However, the sector hasn't yet made a big impact on the local economy. A significant amount of foreign direct investment was drawn to the area, mostly for the purpose of mining for diamonds and gold. The "2009 Central and West Zone Mining Implementation Report" states that El-Hillal Minerals Limited, a medium-scale diamond mining firm, operates in Buganika in the Mwadui area of the Kishapu District.
While other significant enterprises, such Pangea Minerals Limited and Kahama Mining Corporation Limited, deal with gold mining at Buzwagi and Bulyanhulu in Kahama District, [[Williamson diamond mine|Williamson Diamonds]] Limited, a large-scale diamond mining company, works in the Mwadui area.<ref name="Guide2020"/>

===Infrastructure, water and energy===
The majority of families in the region (94.3%) use firewood as their primary source of energy for cooking, followed by charcoal (4.9%) and other sources (0.8%). The Ibadakuli industrial area in Shinyanga Municipality serves as the transmission hub for the national electricity grid for the Shinyanga Region, which is connected to it, which runs the industries including the diamond mines.<ref name="Guide2020"/>

There is enough water available in the area right now. By 2019, 835,770 families had access to trustworthy and secure water sources. Water will be brought to Shinyanga in the first phase of the ongoing Lake Victoria Project, while other places beyond the Shinyanga region will receive water in the second phase.<ref name="Guide2020"/>{{pn|date=April 2024}}

The overall length of the [[road]] network in the Shinyanga Region is 4,627.81 kilometres. Kahama District has the greatest road network, at 2,135.3 kilometres, followed by Shinyanga District, at 1,799.41 kilometres. In general, 38.2 per cent of the area's road network is open all year long. Transit cargo headed for Burundi, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo is transported through the Isaka Dry Port (DRC). Another chance like this will encourage trade between East African nations. At Shinyanga Railway Facility, a domestic cargo handling station was created in 2020. <ref name="Guide2020"/>{{pn|date=April 2024}}

====Airports====
There are two [[air strips]] in the area: one is in the Kahama Town Council and the other is in the Shinyanga Municipality's Ibadakuli section.

Regular flights will rise as a result of the Ibadakuli Airstrip's ongoing upgrading projects, and the area will gain from greater air travel and related activity. Non-scheduled aviation traffic for medical, tourist, and other services uses Kahama Airstrip to serve the area.<ref name="Guide2020"/>{{pn|date=April 2024}}

====Railways====
The Central Line, a [[railroad]] that runs through Shinyanga Region, is well-known in the area. Shinyanga is connected to Mwanza, Tabora, Singida, [[Dodoma]], [[Morogoro Region|Morogoro]], [[Pwani Region|Pwani]], Dar es Salaam, [[Katavi Region|Katavi]], and Kigoma through the Central Line. Through Seke and Songwa stations in Kishapu District, Shinyanga Station, Usule and Lohumbo stations in Shinyanga District, and Isaka Station in Kahama District, this railway line offers services throughout the Shinyanga Region.<ref name="Guide2020"/>{{pn|date=April 2024}}
====Mass communication====
[[Internet]], [[telephone]] (landline and mobile), radio, and postal services are all available in the Shinyanga Region. [[Tanzania Telecommunications Corporation|Tanzania Telecommunication Company Limited]] (TTCL) and five (5) mobile phone service providers—TIGO, Airtel, VODACOM, Halotel, and ZANTEL—provide telecommunication services in the region.
In addition to this, there are five post office branches and seven sub-post offices, two radio stations (Radio Faraja and Kahama FM), internet service providers, and radio stations.
There are additional internet services accessible. The optical fiber connection connects the Shinyanga Region (OFC).<ref name="Guide2020"/>{{pn|date=April 2024}}

===Tourism===
[[Kigosi Game Reserve|Kigosi National Park]], which shares a western boundary with Moyowosi Game Reserve, is located in the Shinyanga Region. This 7,000 square kilometre national park is home to a wide range of wild animals, including [[elephant]]s, [[Hippopotamus|hippo]], [[lion]]s, leopards, [[sitatunga]], [[african buffalo |buffalo]], wild dogs, bushbuck, impala, giraffe, baboons, greater kudu, topi, and roan antelope.<ref name="Guide2020"/>{{pn|date=April 2024}} 

Some historic sites in the region are Usanda/Tinde caverns, which are in the Tinde area and were once utilized by Arabs as rest stops for [[slave trading]] caravans traveling from Kagera or Mwanza before continuing to coastal areas for export, are recognizable as being in the Shinyanga Region. This location was created specifically to collect slaves. Also in Shinyanga is the Iboja Cave in Ushepu District are slave trade caves that are situated in Iboja in Dakama Division, where German troops seized and executed Chief [[Mirambo]] of Wanyamwezi.<ref name="Guide2020"/>{{pn|date=April 2024}} 

In the Shinyanga Region, there is a location where there is distinctive [[hot spring]]. This hot spring, which is part of Shinyanga Municipality and is formerly known as Uzogole hot spring, has a distinctive history. According to legend, the water from the hot natural spring is thought to possess some type of [[Spirituality|spiritual]] power. As a result of this belief, many traditional doctors visit the hot natural spring to gather water for [[therapeutic]] purposes.<ref name="Guide2020"/>{{pn|date=April 2024}}

In contrast to other hot natural springs, once the water is removed, it immediately cools. In the past, hot water was employed as a detergent to get rid of or kill lice from clothing. This site is also where Balozi Malembela's grave is located. He was a historic military commander for the Wasukuma community.<ref name="Guide2020"/>{{pn|date=April 2024}}

Some of the protected places in the Shinyanga Region include the Nyamba and Busongo forest reserves (in the Kishapu District), the Mwantini Forest Reserve (in the Shinyanga District), the Mkweni Hills (in the Kahama Town Council), and the Ubagwe Forest Reserves (in the Ushetu Council).<ref name="Guide2020"/>{{pn|date=April 2024}}
