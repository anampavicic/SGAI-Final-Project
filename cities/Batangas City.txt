'''Batangas City''', officially the '''City of Batangas''' ({{lang-tgl|Lungsod ng Batangas}}), is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] and capital of the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Batangas]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 351,437 people.{{PH census|current}}

Batangas City is classified as one of the fastest urbanizing cities of the Philippines, and is known as the "Industrial Port City of [[Calabarzon]]". It is home to the [[Batangas International Port]], one of the busiest passenger and container terminals in the Philippines. It also hosts one of the largest oil refineries in the country, three [[natural gas]] power plants, and several other major industries. In addition, the city also serves as the educational, industrial and the transportation center of the province.

Batangas City is one of the proposed metropolitan area in the Philippines. Metro Batangas is proposed to include the component city of Batangas, as well as the towns of [[Alitagtag]], [[Bauan, Batangas|Bauan]], [[Ibaan, Batangas|Ibaan]], [[Lobo, Batangas|Lobo]], [[Mabini, Batangas|Mabini]], [[Rosario, Batangas|Rosario]], [[San Juan, Batangas|San Juan]], [[San Luis, Batangas|San Luis]], [[San Pascual, Batangas|San Pascual]], [[Santa Teresita, Batangas|Santa Teresita]], [[Taal, Batangas|Taal]], [[Taysan, Batangas|Taysan]] and [[Tingloy]].

== History ==
=== Foreign rule ===
[[File:Philippine Island - Batangas - NARA - 68155870.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Batangas, circa 1923]]

The first [[Spain|Spanish]] missionaries arrived in Batangas City in 1572 due to group migration. Finally, in 1581, Spanish authorities governing the Philippines created a ''[[pueblo]]'' in the area which included the hill (now ''Hilltop'') where the present Provincial Capitol of Batangas stands after the formal end of the Coumintang Kingdom. The town was named "Batangan" because huge logs, locally called "batang", abounded in the place. The Spanish government appointed Don Agustin Casilao as Batangan's first [[gobernadorcillo]]. Said title of "little governor" as head of the pueblo or ''municipio'' was replaced in 1894 by "''capital municipal''". It is not clear who succeeded Casilao nor is it known whether there were subsequent appointments of capital municipal. Don Agustin Casilao is sometimes referred to as Agustino or Augustino in some sources. By 1870, its barangays were Balagtas, [[Bilogo]], Bolbok, Bukal, Catandala, Konde, De La Paz, Kumintang Ibaba, Matuko, Mapagong, Paharang Kanluran, Pairang, Pinamucan, Patulo, Sampaga, San Agapito, San Isidro and Talahib.<ref name="government8">{{Harvnb|Local Government of Batangas City|1999|pp=8}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|City Investment & Tourism Office|2006}}</ref>

At the coming of the [[United States|Americans]] in the early 1900s, local civil government of Batangas was set up. It took effect on July 4, 1901, with Jose Villanueva elected as "Municipal President." His term expired in 1903.<ref name="government8"/>

Subsequent elections installed the following as municipal presidents: Juan Palacios, 1904–1905; Jose Arguelles, 1906; Marcelo Llana, 1907; Sisenando Ferriols, 1908–1909; Ventura Tolentino, 1910–1914; Julian Rosales, 1915; Juan Gutierrez, 1916–1919; Julian Rosales, 1920–1922; Juan Buenafe, 1923–1930; Perfecto Condez, 1931–1937; Juan Buenafe, 1938–1940.
In 1941 the title "Municipal President" was changed to "Municipal Mayor." Pedro Berberabe was elected first municipal mayor.<ref name="government8"/>

Batangas City was severely damaged due to the [[Military of Japan|Japanese]] [[A6M Zero]] bombardment and on December 12, 1941, the Batangas Airport which is located in Barangay Alangilan is totally destroyed. On October 14, 1943, municipal councilor Roman L. Perez was appointed Mayor by the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] after the inauguration of the Second Republic of the Philippines. Liberation begun when 158th Regimental Combat Team (or 158th RCT) under the command of the [[US 6th Army]] reached Poblacion, Batangas City by March 11 during the [[Philippines Campaign (1944–45)|Philippines Liberation Campaign of 1944–45]]. By the end of April the same that year, some elements of the 188th Glider Infantry Regiment of the [[11th Airborne Division]] was left to clear the barangays east and mountains south of the city as the main Allied Force continued their drive towards the [[Quezon Province]]. Some of local guerrillas and irregulars of the [[Philippine resistance against Japan|President Quezon's Own Guerrillas (PQOG)]] was entering and re-invaded in Batangas City. Throughout the battle, recognized guerrilla fighters played an important key role in the advancement of the combined American and Philippine troops, providing key roads and information for the Japanese location of defenses and movements. Hostilities ended as the war came closer to the end.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.batangascity.gov.ph/historicalbackground.htm|title=Official Website: Historical Background|access-date=July 9, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726192457/http://www.batangascity.gov.ph/historicalbackground.htm|archive-date=July 26, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="ibiblio1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P-Triumph/USA-P-Triumph-23.html|title=Ibiblio.org: Triumph in the Philippines, Chapter XXIII Securing the Visayan Passages, Southern Luzon|access-date=July 9, 2010}}</ref>

=== Independence and onwards ===

After the Liberation, President [[Manuel Roxas]] issued his reappointment. Mayor Perez ran and won in 1944, the first post-War elections in the country. In November 1949, he was killed by an unknown assassin. Vice Mayor Atilano Magadia succeeded Perez as Mayor, serving until 1951. Mayor Macario Chavez was elected in 1951; his four-year term ended in 1955.<ref name="government8"/>

People voted Pedro S. Tolentino overwhelmingly as mayor in 1956. He was reelected three times.<ref name="government8"/>

=== Cityhood ===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}

In 1965, Republic Act No. 4586 was signed by President [[Diosdado Macapagal]], converting Batangas into a city. If successful, it would be renamed as Laurel, after former President [[Jose P. Laurel]], a native of [[Tanauan, Batangas|Tanauan]].<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=RA|number=4586|date=June 19, 1965|title=An Act Creating Laurel City|accessdate=June 25, 2023|website=The Lawphil Project - Arellano Law Foundation, Inc.|url=https://lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1965/ra_4586_1965.html}}</ref> However, the voters rejected the cityhood and renaming of Batangas in a plebiscite.

On June 21, 1969, Republic Act No. 5495 was enacted to convert Batangas into a city, this time using its same name.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=RA|number=5945|date=June 21, 1969|title=An Act Creating Batangas City|accessdate=June 25, 2023|website=The Lawphil Project - Arellano Law Foundation, Inc.|url=https://lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1969/ra_5495_1969.html}}</ref> Later on July 23, Batangas formally became a city by virtue of Proclamation No. 581 that was signed a week earlier.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=PP|number=581, s. 1969|date=July 16, 1969|title=Designating July 23, .1969, as the date for the formal organization of the government of Batangas City|website=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines]]|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1969/07/16/proclamation-no-581-s-1969/}}</ref> Pedro S. Tolentino became its first city mayor.

=== Contemporary history ===
The succeeding city mayors are Mayor Macario M. Mendoza, 1974–1979; Alfredo M. Borbon, 1979–1980, Conrado C. Berberabe, 1980–1986; Jose M. Atienza, 1986–1987; Mario M. Perez, 1987, Eduardo B.

Meanwhile, on January 19, 2008, President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] opened Phase II project of the Batangas City International Container Port (with turn-over to the [[Philippine Ports Authority]]). She also inspected a major road project in [[Southern Tagalog]]. She then inspected the P1.5-billion [[Southern Tagalog Arterial Road]] (STAR), Stage II-Phase 1 connecting [[Lipa City|Lipa]] (19.74&nbsp;kilometers and Batangas and the [[South Luzon Expressway]] (SLEX) road widening, expansion and the STAR toll way development projects in Batangas.<ref>{{cite news|work=ABS-CBN News|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=106155|archive-url=https://archive.today/20070709212017/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=106155|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 9, 2007|title=President Arroyo inaugurates Batangas Port project|access-date=July 9, 2010}}</ref>

With the expansion of Batangas Port, the operation of different heavy industries and the construction of Phase II of the STAR Tollway project and diversion roads, Batangas City has seen a gradual shift from an agricultural economy to a commercial economy and eventually to an industrial economy.

The northwest of the city hosts different commercial establishments while the lowland areas surrounding Batangas Bay hosts the heavy industries of the city. However, despite its gradual shift in becoming a major commercial/industrial hub for Calabarzon, it still shares rural landscapes that is still preserved in the north part of the city. The Poblacion area is the major retail and commercial center of the city. It is filled with banks, restaurants, and local businesses.

Being a major port city, Batangas has seen an increase in migrants from nearby provinces, islands, and even nation states such as China, India, Indonesia and Malaysia.

===Agriculture===
Agriculture remains an important source of food and income for residents of rural barangays. Residents in rural areas practice subsidence farming, with some of their harvest sold to the lowland public wet markets. Major crops include coconut, corn, vegetables, and mangoes.

===Industries===

Despite the construction of the diversion, traffic bottlenecks remained inside the city. The city government is constructing a bypass road in the east to provide better access to the fast-growing industrial areas in the south of the city.

Streets in the area are mostly named from historical figures, such as [[Apolinario Mabini]], [[Diego Silang]], [[Juan B. Alegre]], the [[Gomburza]] ([[Mariano Gomez (priest)|Mariano Gomez]], [[José Burgos]], and [[Jacinto Zamora]]) and the ''[[ilustrados]]'' ([[José Rizal]], [[Marcelo del Pilar]], and [[Graciano López Jaena]]).
