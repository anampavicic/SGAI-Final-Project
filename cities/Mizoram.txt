'''Mizoram''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Mizorampron.ogg|m|ɪ|ˈ|z|ɔːr|ə|m}}) is a [[states and union territories of India|state]] in [[northeastern India]], with [[Aizawl]] as its seat of government and largest city. Within India's northeast region, it is the southernmost state, sharing borders with three of the [[Seven Sister States]], namely [[Tripura]], [[Assam]] and [[Manipur]], and also shares a {{convert|722|km|adj=on}} border with the neighbouring countries of [[Bangladesh]] and [[Myanmar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dipr.mizoram.gov.in/page/about-mizoram |title=About Mizoram |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620093508/http://dipr.mizoram.gov.in/page/about-mizoram |archive-date=20 June 2014 |work=Directorate Of Information & Public Relations, Government of Mizoram |access-date=30 October 2023}}</ref> The state spans over an area of approximately 21,087 square kilometres,<ref name=ppimizo/> of which approximately 91% is forested.<ref name=fsi11/> With an estimated population of 1.25 million in 2023, it is the [[List of states and union territories of India by population|second least populous state]] in the country.<ref name=":2023">{{Cite web|url=https://statisticstimes.com/demographics/india/indian-states-population.php|title=Indian states 2023 population estimates|date=1 December 2023|website=www.main.mohfw.gov.in|language=en-in|access-date=29 March 2024}}</ref>

Like several other northeastern states of India, Mizoram was [[Mizo District|previously part of Assam]] until 1972, when it was [[Union Territory of Mizoram|carved out as a Union Territory]]. In 1986, the Indian Parliament adopted the 53rd amendment of the Indian Constitution, which allowed for the creation of the State of Mizoram on 20 February 1987, as India's 23rd state.

About 95% of Mizoram's population descends from a diverse tribal origin. Mizos first began to settle the area in the 16th century, coming in waves of immigration from [[Southeast Asia]]. This immigration lasted through the 18th century.<ref>J.M.

Mizoram is a highly literate [[Agrarian society|agrarian economy]]. [[Slash-and-burn]] farming, also known as [[jhum]], is the most common form of farming in the state.<ref name=sapagri/> In recent years, the jhum farming practices have been steadily replaced with a significant [[horticulture]] and [[bamboo]] products industry.<ref name=agristat/><ref name=ibef2/> The state's gross state domestic product for 2012 was estimated at {{INRConvert|69.91|b|lk=r}}.<ref name=ppimizo/> About 20% of Mizoram's population lives below the poverty line, with 35% [[rural poverty]] as of 2014.<ref name=rbipov/> The state has about 871 kilometres of national highways, with NH–54 and NH–150 connecting it to Assam and Manipur respectively. It is also a growing transit point for trade with Myanmar and Bangladesh.<ref name=ibef/>

==Etymology==
The term Mizoram is derived from two [[Mizo people|Mizo]] words: ''Mizo'' and ''ram''. 'Mizo' is the [[endonym]] of the native inhabitants and 'ram' means 'land'. Thus "Mizoram" means "land of the Mizos" or "Mizo land".<ref>Sajnani, Encyclopaedia of Tourism Resources in India, Volume 1, {{ISBN|81-78350173}}, p. 241.</ref><ref>Lalthangliana B (2001) The History of Mizos in India, Burma and Bangladesh.</ref>

The origin of the [[Mizos]], like those of many other tribes in the northeastern India, is shrouded in mystery. The people living in the Mizo Hills were generally referred to as the Cucis or [[Kukis]] by their neighbouring ethnic groups which was also a term adopted by the British writers. The claim that 'The [[Kuki people|Kukis]] are the earliest known residents of the Mizo hills area,' must be read in this light.<ref name = "Suhas1994">{{cite book | first=Suhas | last=Chatterjee | title=Making of Mizoram: Role of Laldenga | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GI-1rMckfpEC&pg=PA1 | access-date=28 August 2013 | year=1994 | publisher=M.D. Publications | isbn=978-81-85880-38-9 | page=1 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231142843/http://books.google.com/books?id=GI-1rMckfpEC&pg=PA1 | archive-date=31 December 2013 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The majority of the tribes classified as "Mizo" today most likely migrated to their present territories from the neighbouring countries in several waves, starting around 1500 CE.<ref name="GrantSteve_2010">{{cite book | title = Rodent Outbreaks: Ecology and Impacts | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yaI0NFQb36UC&pg=PA22 | editor1-first = Grant | editor1-last = Singleton | editor2-first = Steve | editor2-last = Belmain | editor3-first = Peter | editor3-last = Brown | editor4-first = Bill | editor4-last = Hardy | access-date = 28 August 2013 | year = 2010 | publisher = International Rice Research Institute | isbn = 978-971-22-0257-5 | pages = 22– | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131231142819/http://books.google.com/books?id=yaI0NFQb36UC&pg=PA22 | archive-date = 31 December 2013 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

===Chieftainship===
{{main|Mizo Chieftainship}}
Before the [[British Raj]], the various Mizo clans lived in autonomous villages. The tribal chiefs enjoyed an eminent position in the [[gerontocracy|gerontocratic]] Mizo society. The various clans and subclans practised slash-and-burn, locally called ''[[jhum cultivation|jhum]]'' cultivation - a form of [[subsistence agriculture]].<ref>RAMAKRISHNAN and PATNAIK, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23002231 Jhum: Slash and Burn Cultivation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907082559/https://www.jstor.org/stable/23002231 |date=7 September 2018 }}, India International Centre Quarterly, Vol. 19, No. 1/2, INDIGENOUS VISION: PEOPLES OF INDIA ATTITUDES TO THE ENVIRONMENT (SPRING-SUMMER 1992), pp. 215-220</ref> The chiefs were the absolute rulers of their respective clans' territories (''ram''), although they remained under the nominal political jurisdictions of the rulers of Manipur, Tripura and Burma.<ref name = "Suhas1995">{{cite book | first = Suhas | last = Chatterjee | title = Mizo Chiefs and the Chiefdom | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YON9iVgsDRUC&pg=PA1 | access-date = 28 August 2013 | date = 1 January 1995 | publisher = M.D. Publications | isbn = 978-81-85880-72-3 | pages = 1–3 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160609201244/https://books.google.com/books?id=YON9iVgsDRUC&pg=PA1 | archive-date = 9 June 2016 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

Prior to 1889, the year that the British Raj gained political control over Mizoram through the [[Chin-Lushai Expedition of 1889–90|Chin-Lushai Expedition]], there were many reports of head-hunting in the Mizoram area via tribal raids led by the village chieftains. Head-hunting was a practice which often involved the ambushing of a rival tribe, the taking of slaves and the cutting off of the heads of the defenders. These heads would sometimes be displayed at the entrances to the tribal village of the victors.<ref>John Shakespeare, {{Google book|N0PXAAAAMAAJ|The Lushei Kuki Clans}}, pages 60, 144-158, 200-220</ref>

===British era (1840s to 1940s)===
{{main|British rule in the Lushai Hills}}
Some of the earliest records of raids and intertribal conflicts are from the early 19th century.<ref name=cnun2>C. Nunthara (2002), Mizoram: Society and Polity, {{ISBN|978-8173870590}}, pp 51-55</ref> In the 1840s, Captain Blackwood of Britain marched into the Mizo Hills with his troops to punish a Palian tribal chief for raiding British interests in India. A few years later, Captain Lester was wounded in a battle with the Lusei tribe in the region that is now Mizoram. In 1849, a Lusei tribal raid killed 29 members of the Thadou tribe and added 42 captives to their clan. Colonel Lister retaliated in 1850, with the co-operation of the Thadou tribe, an event historically called the ''First British invasion'', burning down a Lusei village of 800 tribal houses and freeing 400 Thadou captives.<ref name=cnun2/><ref>Lalrinnunga Hmar (2010), MIGRATION AND SOCIAL FORMATION OF THE MIZO, PhD Thesis (Awarded), THE NORTH EASTER HILL UNIVERSITY SHILLONG, Chapter 5, pages 115-140</ref> British historical records on the Mizo Hills state that similar inter-ethnic tribal raids continued for decades after the ''First British Invasion.'' Such raids would be for the purpose of seeking out loot, slaves or retaliation for earlier lost battles.<ref name=misai/>

The Mizo Hills became part of [[British India]] in 1889 split between Assam in the North and Bengal in the South. Practices such as head-hunting were banned in Mizoram as well as neighbouring regions.<ref>Ved Prakash (2007), Encyclopaedia of North-East India, Vol. 1 ({{ISBN|978-81-269-0703-8}}), 4 ({{ISBN|978-81-269-0706-9}}) & 5 ({{ISBN|978-81-269-0707-6}})</ref> The northern and southern Mizo Hills became the Lushai Hills, with Aizawl as their headquarters by declaring the whole area as an "excluded area" till India got independence from the British.<ref>[http://mizoram.nic.in/about/history.htm Mizoram History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721173040/http://www.mizoram.nic.in/about/history.htm |date=21 July 2011 }}, National Informatics Centre, Government of India (2012)</ref> At the time of the British conquest, there were around 60 chiefs.<ref name="Suhas1995"/>

===Post 1947===
{{main|Mizo District}}
By the time India gained independence from the British Empire, the number of tribal chiefs had increased to over 200. The educated elites among the Mizos campaigned against the tribal [[chiefdom]]s under the banner of the [[Mizo Union]]. As a result of their campaign, the hereditary rights of the 259 chiefs were abolished under the Assam-Lushai District ("Acquisition of Chief's Rights") Act, 1954.<ref name="Suhas1995"/><ref name=misai/> Village courts were re-implemented in the Mizo region along with other parts of Assam. Few Christian missionaries came to Mizoram during the colonial period knowing that the rural hill population was busy fighting among different tribes. The missionaries propagated Christianity with the support of the British government. As a result, majority of the population converted to Christianity and changed their faiths without any resistance.

{{main|Mizo National Front uprising}}
The Mizos were particularly dissatisfied with the government's inadequate response to the 1959–60 [[mautam]] famine. The Mizo National Famine Front, a body formed for famine relief in 1959, later developed into a new political organisation, the [[Mizo National Front]] (MNF), in 1961.<ref name="Braja1998"/> On 28 February 1966, the Mizo National Front launched an uprising in [[Aizawl]] to declare independence from India.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goswami|first=Namrata|date=2009|title=The Indian Experience of Conflict Resolution in Mizoram|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09700160902907118|journal=Strategic Analysis|language=en|volume=33|issue=4|pages=579–589|doi=10.1080/09700160902907118|s2cid=154851791 }}</ref> The Indian government retaliated with coordinated air bombings in the only instance to happen on Indian soil on 5–6 March on Aizawl and subdued the uprising.<ref name="sahrdc_afspa">{{cite web|title=Armed Forces Special Powers Act: A study in National Security tyranny|url=http://www.hrdc.net/sahrdc/resources/armed_forces.htm|access-date=13 October 2010|publisher=South Asia Human Rights Documentation Centre (SAHRDC)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230410183225/https://www.hrdc.net/sahrdc/resources/armed_forces.htm|archive-date=10 April 2023|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Mizo National Front turned to underground operations within the forested regions of Mizoram and utilised towns and villages as logistic points and other guerrilla operations. This led to the army to pursue displacement policies in which villages were grouped and moved close to highways.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Phukan |first1=Mridula Dhekial |date= August 2013 |title= Ethnicity, Conflict and Population Displacement in Northeast India|url=https://www.academia.edu/36348465 |journal=Asian Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences (AJHSS) |volume= 1 |issue= 2 |pages= 91–101 |via=[[Academia.edu]]}}</ref> The insurgency would continue to operate at lower levels until the signing of the [[Mizo Accord]] in 1986.

{{main|Union Territory of Mizoram}}
In 1971, the government agreed to convert Mizo District into a Union Territory, which became Mizoram in 1972. In 1986, [[Mizoram Peace Accord]] (1986) was agreed between the Government and the MNF. In 1986, the Indian Parliament adopted the 53rd amendment of the Indian Constitution, which allowed for the creation of the State of Mizoram on 20 February 1987, as India's 23rd state.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mizoram To Be 23rd State Of India, Tribal Customs Protected|url=https://apnews.com/3ad643fb331a404302e1b02172ded7b5|access-date=20 August 2012|newspaper=APN News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728192739/http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1986/Mizoram-To-Be-23rd-State-Of-India-Tribal-Customs-Protected/id-3ad643fb331a404302e1b02172ded7b5|archive-date=28 July 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name = "AlfredJuan2011">{{cite book | first1 =Alfred | last1 =Stepan | first2 =Juan J | last2 =Linz | first3 =Yogendra | last3 =Yadav | title =Crafting State-Nations: India and Other Multinational Democracies | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=kGUuOdeCiXQC&pg=PA105 | access-date =28 August 2013 | date =20 January 2011 | publisher =JHU Press | isbn =978-0-8018-9723-8 | pages =105– | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20131231142846/http://books.google.com/books?id=kGUuOdeCiXQC&pg=PA105 | archive-date =31 December 2013 | url-status =live | df =dmy-all }}</ref> Mizoram was given two seats in the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]], one each in the [[Lok Sabha]] and in the [[Rajya Sabha]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Baruah|first=Sanjib|title= Durable Disorder: Understanding the Politics of Northeast India|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>

{{Main|Geography of Mizoram}}
Mizoram is a landlocked state in [[Northeast India|North East India]] whose southern part shares 722<ref name=ppimizo/> kilometres long international borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh, and northern part share domestic borders with Manipur, Assam and Tripura. It is the fifth smallest state of India with {{convert|21087|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}. It extends from 21°56'N to 24°31'N, and 92°16'E to 93°26'E.<ref name=ripa>Rintluanga Pachuau, pagal Mizoram: A Study in Comprehensive Geography, {{ISBN|978-81-7211-264-6}}, Chapter 3</ref> The [[tropic of cancer]] runs through the state nearly at its middle. The maximum north–south distance is 285&nbsp;km, while maximum east–west stretch is 115&nbsp;km.<ref name=ripa/>

Mizoram is a land of rolling hills, valleys, rivers and lakes. As many as 21 major hill ranges or peaks of different heights run through the length and breadth of the state, with plains scattered here and there. The average height of the hills to the west of the state is about {{convert|1000|m|ft}}. These gradually rise up to {{convert|1300|m|ft}} to the east. Some areas, however, have higher ranges which go up to a height of over {{convert|2000|m|ft}}.

Mizoram terrain is, according to the Geological Survey of India, an immature topography, and the physiographic expression consists of several almost north–south longitudinal valleys containing series of small and flat hummocks, mostly anticlinal, parallel to sub-parallel hill ranges and narrow adjoining synclinal valleys with series of topographic highs. The general geology of western Mizoram consists of repetitive succession of Neogene sedimentary rocks of the Surma Group and Tipam Formation such as sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and rare pockets of shell limestone. The eastern part is the Barail Group.<ref name=gsi/> Mizoram lies in [[Earthquake hazard zoning of India|seismic zone V]], according to the India Meteorological Department; as with other northeastern states of India, this means the state has the highest risk of earthquakes relative to other parts of India.<ref>{{cite map |publisher=India Meteorological Department |title=Seismic zoning map |url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/seismo/static/seismo-zone.htm |access-date=20 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140603143951/http://www.imd.gov.in/section/seismo/static/seismo-zone.htm |archive-date=3 June 2014 }}</ref>

The biggest river in Mizoram is Chhimtuipui, also known as Kaladan (or Kolodyne). It originates in [[Chin state]] in Burma and passes through [[Saiha district|Saiha]] and [[Lawngtlai district|Lawngtlai]] districts in the southern tip of Mizoram, goes back to Burma's Rakhine state. Although many more rivers and streams drain the hill ranges, the most important and useful rivers are the [[Tlawng]], [[Tut River|Tut]], [[Tuirial River|Tuirial]] and [[Tuivawl River|Tuivawl]] which flow through the northern territory and eventually join the [[Barak River]] in [[Cachar District]].

Mizoram has a mild climate, being relatively cool in summer {{convert|20|to|29|C|F}} but progressively warmer, most probably due to climate change, with summer temperatures crossing 30 degrees Celsius and winter temperatures ranging from {{convert|7|to|22|C|F}}. The region is influenced by [[monsoon]]s, raining heavily from May to September with little rain in the dry (cold) season. The climate pattern is moist tropical to moist sub-tropical, with average state rainfall {{convert|254|cm|in}} per annum. In the capital Aizawl, rainfall is about {{convert|215|cm|in}} and in [[Lunglei]], another major centre, about {{convert|350|cm|in}}.<ref name=gsi>{{Cite report| title= Geology and mineral resources of Manipur, Mizoram, '''Nagaland''' and Tripura| url= http://www.portal.gsi.gov.in/gsiImages/information/miscpub30-4-2_man-mizo-naga-tripura.pdf| publisher= Geological Survey of India, Government of India| series= Miscellaneous publication No. 30 Part IV| volume= 1 (Part-2)| year= 2011| access-date= 20 June 2014| url-status= dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130510091749/http://www.portal.gsi.gov.in/gsiImages/information/miscpub30-4-2_man-mizo-naga-tripura.pdf| archive-date= 10 May 2013| df= dmy-all}}</ref> The state is in a region where cyclones and landslides can cause weather-related emergencies.<ref>[http://ndma.gov.in/en/mizoram-sdma-office Mizoram] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329161431/http://www.ndma.gov.in/en/mizoram-sdma-office |date=29 March 2014 }} National Disaster Management Authority, Govt of India (2011)</ref>

Mizoram has the third highest total forest cover with {{formatnum:1594000}} hectares ({{formatnum:3940000}} acres), and highest percentage area (90.68%) covered by forests, among the states of India, according to 2011 Forest Survey of India.<ref name=fsi11/> Tropical semi-evergreen, tropical moist deciduous, subtropical broadleaved hill and subtropical pine forests are the most common vegetation types found in Mizoram. Bamboo is common in the state, typically intermixed with other forest vegetation; about 9,245&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (44%) of the state's area is bamboo bearing. The state and central governments of India have cooperated to reserve and protect 67% of the land covered by forests, and additional 15% by management. Only 17% of the land is non-forested area for cultivation, industry, mining, housing and other commercial human activity. Satellite data suggests 91% of state's geographical area is covered by forests.<ref name=fsi11>[http://www.fsi.org.in/cover_2011/mizoram.pdf 9.19 Mizoram] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126034506/http://www.fsi.org.in/cover_2011/mizoram.pdf |date=26 November 2013 }} India State of Forest Report 2011, Govt of India (2012)</ref>

Jhum cultivation, or slash-and-burn practice, was a historic tradition in Mizoram and a threat to its forest cover. This practice has reduced in recent decades, due to a government-supported initiative to support horticultural crops such as pineapple and banana plantations.<ref name=fsi11/>

===Ethnic groups===
The great majority of Mizoram's population consists of several ethnic tribes who are either culturally or linguistically linked. These ethnic groups are collectively known as [[Mizo people|Mizo]]s (''Mi'' means People, ''Zo'' meaning the name of a progenitor; Mizo thus is People of [[Zo people|Zo]] origin<ref name=misai>Michael Sailo (2006), Administration of Justice in Mizoram, {{ISBN|978-8183240598}}, Chapter 2</ref>).

Sometime in the 16th century CE, the first batch of Mizo crossed Tiau River and settled in Mizoram and they were called as [[Kuki people|Kukis]] by [[Bengalis]].<ref name=lsmgov/> The term Kuki mean the inhabitants of the interior and inaccessible mountain tracts. Sometimes grouped as [[Kuki-Chin-Mizo people|Kuki-Chin]] tribes, The First batch were called Old Kukis, which are the [[Biate people|Biate]], [[Ranglong]] and the [[Hrangkhol people|Hrangkhol]], and the second batch that followed include [[Lushei]] (or Lusei), [[Paite people|Paite]], [[Lai people|Lai]], [[Mara people|Mara]], [[Ralte people|Ralte]], [[Hmar people|Hmar]], [[Thadou people|Thadou]], Shendus, and several other.<ref name=lsmgov>[http://landrevenue.mizoram.gov.in/uploads/files/historical-evolution-of-mizoram.pdf THE LAND SYSTEMS OF MIZORAM] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714155933/http://landrevenue.mizoram.gov.in/uploads/files/historical-evolution-of-mizoram.pdf |date=14 July 2014 }}, Govt of Mizoram (2007)</ref>

The [[Bru people|Bru]] ([[Reang language|Reang]]), [[Chakma people|Chakma]], [[Tanchangya people|Tanchangya]] are some non-Kuki tribes of Mizoram, with some suggestion that some of these are [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] in their origins.<ref name="lsmgov" /> The [[Bnei Menashe]] tribe claim [[Jews|Jewish]] descent.<ref name="mzote">Zote, Mona (2005), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23006028 Heaven in Hell: A paradox] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913002342/https://www.jstor.org/stable/23006028 |date=13 September 2018 }}, India International Centre Quarterly, Vol. 32, No. 2/3, pp 203-212.</ref>

The diversity of tribal groups reflects the historical immigration patterns. Different tribes and sub-tribes arrived in the present Mizoram, in successive waves and settled down in different parts of the state. Further, as they arrived, there were raids, fear of raids and intertribal feuds. The resulting isolation and separation created numerous tribes and sub-tribes.<ref name=lsmgov/>

Other than tribal groups, other ethnic groups inhabit Mizoram including [[Bengalis]] and [[Nepalis]].<ref name="Lang2011"/><ref name="Bareh"/> [[Gurkha|Nepali Gorkhas]], for example, were encouraged to settle in [[Aizawl]] area and other parts of Mizoram during the British colonial times. Thousands of their descendants are now residents of Mizoram.<ref name="Bareh">Hamlet Bareh, Encyclopaedia of North-East India: Mizoram, Volume 5, {{ISBN|8170997925}}, pp 260-261</ref>

There are also a few Mizos who practice [[Judaism]] (866 according to the 2001 census) and a modernised traditional Mizo religion called ''Hnam sakhua'', which places a special emphasis on Mizo culture and seeks to revive traditional Mizo values while opposing the influence of [[Christianity]] on Mizo people.<ref name="Government of Mizoram">{{Cite web|url=https://www.panchayatportals.gov.in/web/department-of-panchyati-raj-mizoram/hidden/-/asset_publisher/h7cmn7e306iI/content/about-mizoram|title=About Mizoram|publisher=Dept of Panchayati Raj, Government of Mizoram|access-date=28 March 2019|archive-date=28 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328052720/https://www.panchayatportals.gov.in/web/department-of-panchyati-raj-mizoram/hidden/-/asset_publisher/h7cmn7e306iI/content/about-mizoram|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Politics==

[[File:Mizoram Assembly House (front entrance).jpg |thumb|Mizoram Assembly House]]
Originally village land, locally called ''ram'', was the property of the tribal chief. The institution of [[chieftainship]] began in the 16th century. Each village behaved like a small state, and the chief was called ''Lal''. The rule was hereditary, and there were no written laws (the first script for Mizo language was developed by [[Christian Missionaries]] Lorraine and Savidge about 1895).<ref name=misai/>

After annexation by the [[British Empire|British]] in the 1890s, the northern part of Mizoram was administered as the [[Lushai Hills]] district of [[Assam]], while southern Mizoram was part of [[Bengal]]. In 1898, the southern part was transferred from Bengal to Assam. The colonial power retained the chiefs and Mizo customs, including the socially stratified hereditary transfer of political power. In 1937, under Section 6 of the Scheduled District Act, the British administration<ref name=misai/> consolidated executive and legislative political power to the [[Deputy Commissioner (India)|Deputy Commissioner]] and [[District magistrate]]s, with village chiefs in advisory role. The political and judiciary powers of chiefs were neither final nor exclusive, thereafter. Rulings could be appealed to courts staffed with British officials. After India gained independence from the colonial rule, the region was granted autonomous status in 1952, where Mizo people formulated their own laws and delivered judicial decisions. The region was renamed as Mizo District within Assam State in April 1954 and in that year, the institution of hereditary chieftainship was abolished, and instead village courts/council were set up.<ref name=misai/>

The representatives of the Lushai Hills Autonomous District Council and the [[Mizo Union]] pleaded with the [[States Reorganisation Commission]] (SRC) to integrate the Mizo-dominated areas of [[Tripura]] and [[Manipur]] with the District Council in Assam. The tribal leaders in the northeast were unhappy with the final SRC recommendations and met in Aizawl in 1955 to form a new political party, [[Eastern Indian Tribal Union|Eastern India Tribal Union (EITU)]].<ref name=dommen>Dommen, A.

In the 1950s, the fears of [[Assamese people|Assamese]] hegemony and perceived lack of government concern led to growing discontent among the Mizos. The Mizos were particularly dissatisfied with the government's inadequate response to the 1959–60 [[mautam]] famine. The Mizo National Famine Front, a body formed for famine relief in 1959, later developed into a new political organisation, the [[Mizo National Front]] (MNF) in 1961.<ref name="Braja1998">{{cite book | first=Braja Bihārī | last=Kumāra | title=Small States Syndrome in India | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKqF_AgDd4gC&pg=PA75 | access-date=28 August 2013 | date=1 January 1998 | publisher=Concept | isbn=978-81-7022-691-8 | pages=75 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231142829/http://books.google.com/books?id=nKqF_AgDd4gC&pg=PA75 | archive-date=31 December 2013 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Front sought sovereign independence for the Mizo territory, staging an armed insurrection with the [[March 1966 Mizo National Front uprising|28 February 1966 uprising]] against the government.<ref name=dommen/> The revolt was suppressed by the government of India, which carried out airstrikes in Aizawl and surrounding areas.<ref>{{cite book|last = Lalchungnunga |title= Mizoram politics of regionalism and national integration|year= 1994|publisher=Reliance}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.newslink.in/2007/03/06/memories-of-inferno-still-remain-fresh | title = Memories of inferno still remain fresh | date = 6 March 2007 | newspaper = News link | place = IN | access-date = 17 April 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171951/http://www.newslink.in/2007/03/06/memories-of-inferno-still-remain-fresh | archive-date = 3 March 2016 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}.</ref>

Rice remains the largest crop grown in Mizoram by gross value of output.<ref>Dikshit, K. R., & Dikshit, J. K.

;Jhum practice

Before 1947, agriculture in Mizoram predominantly used to be slash-and-burn driven ''[[shifting cultivation|Jhum]]'' cultivation.

Despite dedicating largest amount of labour, jhum cultivated and non-jhum crop area to rice, the yields are low; Mizoram average rice yields per acre is about 70% of India's average rice yield per acre and 32% of India's best yield. Mizoram produces about 26% of rice it consumes every year, and it buys the deficit from other states of India.<ref name=agristat/>

The crop area used for jhum cultivation rotates in Mizoram; that is, the area slashed and burnt for a crop is abandoned for a few years and then ''jhumias'' return to slash and burn the same plot after a few years of non-use. The primary reasons for cyclical jhum cultivation includes, according to Goswami et al.<ref name=goswami>Goswami, K., Choudhury, H. K., & Saikia, J.

The first primary school was set up in 1898 at Aizawl by Christian missionaries. The state has long enjoyed higher literacy rates than average literacy rates for India. In 1961, the literacy was 51%.<ref>C. Nunthara (2002), Mizoram: Society and Polity, {{ISBN|978-8173870590}}, pp 37-39</ref> By 2011 census, it had reached 92%, compared to 74% average for India.<ref name=ppimizo/> Mizoram is second only to [[Kerala]].<ref>{{cite web|last=India Gov|title=India 2010 - A Reference Annual|url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/profile.php?id=13|publisher=India Gov Website|access-date=10 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927023601/http://india.gov.in/knowindia/profile.php?id=13|archive-date=27 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

There were 3,894 schools in Mizoram as of 2012. Of these, 42% are publicly owned and managed by Central/State governments, 28% are private without government subsidies, 21% are private with government subsidies, and the rest are primary and middle schools that are government financed by run by three Autonomous District Councils of Mizoram. The teacher-pupil ratio is about 1:20 for primary, 1:9 for middle School, 1:13 for high, and 1:15 for higher secondary schools.<ref name=ppimizo/>

There are several educational establishments under the umbrella of the Ministry of Education, including universities, colleges and other institutions. Within [[Mizoram University]], there are 29 undergraduate departments including 2 professional institutions affiliated with the university. The state had 22 other colleges, and the total college enrolment was approximately 10,600 students in 2012.<ref name=ppimizo/> Other well known institutes are [[National Institute of Technology Mizoram]], [[ICFAI University, Mizoram]], [[College of Veterinary Sciences & Animal Husbandry, Selesih, Aizawl, Mizoram]] and [[Regional Institute of Paramedical and Nursing Aizawl]].

===Energy infrastructure===
Mizoram is not self-sufficient in power. In 2012, the state had a demand for 107 MW of power, but had an effective installed capacity of only 29.35 MW. To bridge the gap, it purchased electricity from the national grid.<ref name=mizopow>[http://power.mizoram.gov.in/uploads/files/annual-report-2011-12.pdf Annual Report For 2011-12] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428072850/http://power.mizoram.gov.in/uploads/files/annual-report-2011-12.pdf |date=28 April 2015 }} Power & Electricity Department, Government of Mizoram (2013)</ref>

The hydroelectric power potential of Mizoram was assessed to be about 3600 MW in 2010,<ref name=mizopow2>[http://power.mizoram.gov.in/uploads/files/hydro-power-policy-of-mizoram.pdf Hydro Electric Power Policy Of Mizoram - 2010] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903093148/http://power.mizoram.gov.in/uploads/files/hydro-power-policy-of-mizoram.pdf |date=3 September 2014 }} Govt of Mizoram</ref> and about 4500 MW in 2012.<ref name=mizropow3>[http://power.mizoram.gov.in/page/hydro-power-potential-its-development.html Hydro Power Potential & its Development] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428073205/http://power.mizoram.gov.in/page/hydro-power-potential-its-development.html |date=28 April 2015 }}, Power & Electricity Department, Government Of Mizoram</ref> If even half of this is realised, the state could supply all its citizens and industry with 24/7 electricity, as well as earn income by selling surplus power to the national grid. The topography of Mizoram hydroelectric resources is ideal for power projects. The following rivers are suited for hydel projects with minimal impact on its biosphere – [[Tuivai River|Tuivai]], Tuivawl, Tlawng, Tut, Serlui, Tuirial, Kolodyne, Tuichang, Tuipui, [[Tiau River|Tiau]] and Mat. Beyond the major rivers, Mizoram has many small but perennial streams and rivulets with ideal condition for developing micro/mini and small hydroelectric projects.<ref name=mizopow2/> The state has proposed projects to attract private investments on Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (BOOT) basis with financial assistance in rehabilitating its citizens were they to be affected by the project. The largest proposed project is expected to be on Kolodyne (460 MW), and there are dozens of small to micro projects that have been identified.<ref name=mizopow2/>

==Culture==
{{main|Mizo culture}}

The growth of Christianity, scholars state,<ref>Z. Hlawndo, A STUDY OF THE CULTURAL FACTORS IN THE FOREIGN MISSIONS THINKING OF THE MIZORAM PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, PhD Thesis (Awarded), University of Birmingham (2011)</ref> was shaped from a foundation of cultural, religious and socio-political structure.

A consequence of Hnatlang was the culture of ''Tlawmngaihna'', which does not have a direct English translation. ''Tlawmngaihna'' as cultural concept incorporates behaviour that is self-sacrificing, self-denying, doing what an occasion demands unselfishly and without concern for inconvenience caused, persevering, stoical, stout-hearted, plucky, brave, firm, independent, loath to lose one's good reputation.<ref>James Dokhuma, "Tlawmngaihna" in Meichher, Vol XI, No. 11, April 1976</ref><ref name=nepa>Nevill Parry, {{Google books|ZZsJAQAAIAAJ|Lushai Custom: A monograph on customs and ceremonies}}</ref><ref>K. Thanzauva, ''Mizo Tlawmngaihna and Nishkama Karma'', in United Theological College Magazine, 1984.</ref>

Several other cultural elements of [[Mizo Chieftainship|ancient Mizo tribes]], some of which became less prevalent after arrival of Christianity, included:<ref name=nepa/><ref name=sucha>Suhas Chatterjee (1995), Mizo Chiefs and the Chiefdom, {{ISBN|978-8185880723}}</ref>
*''Zawlbuk'': a place near the chief's home, which served as defence camp in times of war, as well as "bachelor house" where the youth gathered and centre of village life.<ref name=nepa/><ref name="sucha"/>
*''Pathian'': the term for god, to whom prayers and hymns were recited. The evil spirits were called ''ramhuai''.<ref name=sucha/>
*''Nula-rim'': the method of courtship in ancient culture. Courtship, pre-marital sex and polygamy were accepted. The man and the woman could have many partners. If the woman got pregnant, the man was required either marry or pay a substantial sum called ''Sawnman''. If the woman's parents discover the relationship, they had a right to demand a payment called ''Khumpuikaiman''. While pre-marital sex was accepted, a woman who was virgin at marriage was more highly esteemed than one who wasn't.<ref name=nepa/>
*''Pathlawi'': a divorced man.<ref name=nepa/>
*''Ramri lehkha'': a boundary drawing that identified a chief's tenured land called ''ram''. Only the chief owned the land, and this ownership was hereditary. The tribe and village worked and harvested the land.<ref name=nepa/><ref name=sucha/>

===Traditional festivals===

Traditional festivals in Mizoram often revolved around stages of jhum cultivation or the seasons.<ref name=ripac>Rintluanga Pachuau, Mizoram: A Study in Comprehensive Geography, {{ISBN|81-7211-264-5}}, pp 8-10</ref> Community festivals were called ''kut'' in the local language, and there were major and minor kuts such as [[Chapchar Kut]], Thalfavang Kut, [[Mim Kut]] and [[Pawl Kut]]. [[Chapchar Kut]] was the festival of spring (February/March), just before jhum started and land was cut-and-burnt for a new crop. Chapchar Kut was most anticipated by youth, a major festival and involved dancing and feasts. Thalfavang Kut celebrated completion of weeding of the jhum crop fields.<ref>[http://tourism.mizoram.gov.in/page/thalfavang-kut.html Thalfavang Kut] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718023958/http://tourism.mizoram.gov.in/page/thalfavang-kut.html |date=18 July 2014 }} Department of Tourism, Mizoram Government</ref>

[[Chapchar Kut]] was reintroduced and revived in 1973 by Mizo people to celebrate their heritage. Before Christianity arrived in Mizoram, home-brewed alcohol and many meat delicacies were part of the Chapchar celebrations. Now, with Mizoram's state law as a dry state, the youth busy themselves with music and community dancing.<ref>[http://mizoram.nic.in/about/chapcharkut.htm Chapchar Kut] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627011510/http://mizoram.nic.in/about/chapcharkut.htm |date=27 June 2014 }} Government of Mizoram</ref> Along with reviving traditional festivals, the community has been reviving the traditional dances at these festivals, for example, dances such as Cheraw, Khuallam, Chheihlam and Chai.<ref>[http://tourism.mizoram.gov.in/page/chapchar-kut.html CHAPCHAR KUT] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718022416/http://tourism.mizoram.gov.in/page/chapchar-kut.html |date=18 July 2014 }} Dept of Tourism, Govt of Mizoram</ref>

The church leaders (Mizoram Kohhran Hruaitute Committee) argue that state government should keep the ban and not seek to amend the law, while others argue prohibition should be lifted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.webindia123.com/news/articles/India/20090606/1269373.html|title=Mizoram Church no to liquor ban Act amendment Aizawl|date=6 June 2009|work=webindia123|publisher=Suni Systems|access-date=25 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524145549/http://news.webindia123.com/news/articles/India/20090606/1269373.html|archive-date=24 May 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> However, it has been difficult to enforce the ban due to the high demand for alcohol.<ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com">[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/Mizoram-likely-to-lift-liquor-ban-draft-bill-in-house-soon/articleshow/30206676.cms Mizoram likely to lift liquor ban] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214160447/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/Mizoram-likely-to-lift-liquor-ban-draft-bill-in-house-soon/articleshow/30206676.cms |date=14 February 2014 }} The Times of India</ref>

In 2008, the Mizoram Excise and Narcotics (Wine) Rules amended the ban of 1996 to allow the manufacture, export, sale, possession and consumption of [[wine]] in Mizoram made from [[grapes]] and [[guava]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://police.mizoram.gov.in/uploads/files/mltp-act-wine-rules.pdf |title=The Mizoram Excise & Narcotics (Wine) Rules, 2008 |access-date=12 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707024127/https://police.mizoram.gov.in/uploads/files/mltp-act-wine-rules.pdf |archive-date=7 July 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which would help the economy of the state, reduce fruit waste from farms, and encourage large scale commercialisation.

In 2013, the state assembly unanimously passed a resolution to study the impact of liquor prohibition.<ref>[http://www.business-standard.com/article/politics/mizoram-assembly-clears-liquor-prohibition-amendment-bill-113072300400_1.html Mizoram Assembly clears Liquor Prohibition (Amendment) Bill] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022221948/http://www.business-standard.com/article/politics/mizoram-assembly-clears-liquor-prohibition-amendment-bill-113072300400_1.html |date=22 October 2014 }} Business Standard (23 July 2013)</ref> In 2014, the state's narcotics minister noted that the liquor ban had produced some serious problems in Mizo society due to the drinking of spurious and unhealthy (locally made) liquor, known as ''zu''. The government suggested it would introduce an amended liquor bill allowing retail shops to operate in Aizawl and other district headquarters to sell liquor – but not in bars. Furthermore, they would not consult the powerful church on the issue.<ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"/>

===Rat problems===
{{main|Mautam}}
Every 50 years, the [[Mautam]] bamboo blooms and its high-protein seeds lead to an explosion in the [[black rat]] population in the jungle, also referred to as the rat flood, which has historically destroyed entire villages' food supplies after rats move on to farm fields and devour crops. The 1958–59 plague provoked a rural uprising during which the indigenous Mizo people launched a violent 20-year rebellion against the central government. The dispute only saw final resolution in 1986.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1550612/Indian-farmers-braced-for-rat-plague.html | title = Indian farmers braced for rat plague | newspaper = The daily Telegraph | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]] | date = 3 May 2007 | last1 = Foster | first1 = Peter | access-date = 5 April 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171003070549/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1550612/Indian-farmers-braced-for-rat-plague.html | archive-date = 3 October 2017 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}.</ref> The 48-year rat problem recurred in Mizoram in 2006–08.<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/03/photogalleries/bamboo-rat-plague-missions/ PHOTOS: Rat Attack in India Set Off by Bamboo Flowering] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524133254/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/03/photogalleries/bamboo-rat-plague-missions/ |date=24 May 2014 }} National Geographic (March 2009)</ref> The crops suffered massive damage, with yields at 30-year lows; the crop yields recovered sharply to pre-mautam levels in 2009 after the mautam flowering.<ref>Aplin, K., & Lalsiamliana, J.
