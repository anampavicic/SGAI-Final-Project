==Demographics==

The population was estimated to be 289,994 in 2020. The population at the 2005 census was 230,272 on an area of 17.74&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.

==History==
Founded in 1743,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itagui.areadigital.gov.co/Paginas/inicio.aspx |title=Páginas - Inicio |access-date=2011-04-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809055226/http://itagui.areadigital.gov.co/Paginas/inicio.aspx |archive-date=2011-08-09 }}</ref> Itagüí was declared a municipality in 1832.  Its name comes from (according to some historians) the name of an indigenous chief, ''Bitagüí''. Two of Itagüí’s most iconic inhabitants include [[Diego Echavarría Misas]] and [[Eladio Vélez]].

There were two chapels in Itagüí in colonial times; one was in the place of the ''Tablaza'' that had been owned by Bruno Saldarriaga, built with the permission of the Bishop of Popayán, Francisco José de Figueredo (granted December 19, 1743). Saldarriaga, with Francisco Riaza, gave an extension of thirty blocks for expansion. This chapel was what later came to be elevated to the status of parish.

In 1774, the priest of Medellín, Juan Salvador de Villa, called for the creation of four parishes: [[Medellín]], [[Bello, Antioquia|Bello]], [[Envigado]] and Itagüí. On 29 April 1825 party Itagüí neighbors gave Mr. Joaquín Vélez Velasquez to represent them before the civil and ecclesiastical governments to achieve this party was elevated to parish district. Then, Mariano Orjuela Garnica took office as the first bishop of Antioch and the attorney raised the request, but Monsignor Garnica said I should go first to the civil authority, i.e., the governor of the province. This was done, but the governor, Gregorio Maria Urreta was adverse and so reported in a communication of 13 January 1829.

In 1832, Urreta founded the first primary school, at first known by the name of Don Manuel Antonio Piedrahita for several years. It was a private facility, and only in 1871 was opened publicly. On 26 March 1876, Itagüi was connected by [[Telegraph]]. This was unveiled when Mayor Joseph M. Ruiz sent the first telegraph message to President Don Reccared in the state of [[Villa, Colombia|Villa]].

In 1931, the first municipal aqueduct was constructed. On 13 May 1945, the Itagüi Library was unveiled, built by philanthropist Diego Echavarría Misas]p.&nbsp;In 1962, he began building the first formal City Hall. In 1967, the renowned painter of Itagüí, [[Eladio Vélez]], died. In 1993, the [[Centro Administrativo Municipal de Itagüí (CAMI)|Administrative Center Municipal of Itagüí (CAMI)]] and the [[Estadio Metropolitano Ciudad de Itagüí|Estadio Metropolitano City of Itagüí]] were inaugurated. In 2006, Itagüí and Medellín city limits were defined by an industry sector called Bethlehem.

==Etymology==

The territory of the present Itagüí was, along with those of [[Envigado]] and [[Sabaneta, Antioquia|Sabaneta]], a territory inhabited by ''Nutabes'', indigenous tribe which some historians and researchers are classified within the [[Muisca people|Chibcha]] language family. The town was inhabited from the early days of the sixteenth century.

Some historians that the name comes from the indigenous chief ''"Bitagüí"'', apparently his tribe inhabited this territory, although this may be just a legend. Initially Bitagüí site belonged to different owners, many of whom lived in [[Medellin]]. However, later, was inhabited by people who had ties to the founding families of "the Villa" (Medellin).

==Geography==

Itagüi is located south of the [[Aburrá Valley]], a valley in the Andes, has an area of 17&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, making it the third smallest municipality in [[Colombia]]. The municipality is fully urbanized in the flat.

The main stream is the Medellín River, which forms the border with the municipalities of [[Envigado]] and [[Sabaneta, Antioquia|Sabaneta]]. The most important tributary of the river, in the town, is the creek Dona Maria Itagüi walking from west to east.

==Economy==

Itagüí has a favorable tax rate compared to the surrounding [[Antioquia Department]] in having a higher tax collection; which has resulted in the development of major infrastructure in the last 10 years, making it one of [[Colombia]]'s most important economic engines. Itagüí became the site of Colombia's first motorcycle assembly plant when [[Auteco]] opened a factory there in 1962. It also has the presence of other big companies like [[Carrefour]], which has worldwide recognition as [[Walmart]].
