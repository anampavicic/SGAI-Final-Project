'''Lviv''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|v|iː|v}} {{respell|lə|VEEV}} or {{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|v|iː|f}} {{respell|lə|VEEF}}; {{langx|uk|Львів}} {{IPA|uk|ˈlʲwiu̯||Uk-Львів.ogg}}; see [[#Names and symbols|below]] for other names) is the largest city in [[western Ukraine]], as well as the [[List of cities in Ukraine|sixth-largest]] city in Ukraine, with a population of {{Ua-pop-est2022|717,500|punct=.}} It serves as the administrative centre of [[Lviv Oblast]] and [[Lviv Raion]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Те, чого ніколи не було в Україні: Уряд затвердив адмінтерустрій базового рівня, що забезпечить повсюдність місцевого самоврядування |url=https://decentralization.gov.ua/admin/articles/12533.html |url-status=live |access-date=15 December 2021 |website=decentralization.gov.ua |archive-date=14 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220214180228/https://decentralization.gov.ua/admin/articles/12533.html}}</ref> and is one of the main [[Ukrainian culture|cultural centres of Ukraine]]. Lviv also hosts the administration of [[Lviv urban hromada]]. It was named after [[Leo I of Galicia]], the eldest son of [[Daniel of Galicia|Daniel]], [[King of Ruthenia]].

Lviv emerged as the centre of the historical regions of [[Red Ruthenia]] and [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] in the [[14th century]], superseding [[Halych]], [[Chełm]], [[Belz]], and [[Przemyśl]]. It was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]]<ref>Perfecky, George A. (1973). ''The Galician-Volynian Chronicle''. Munich: Wilhelm Fink Verlag. {{OCLC|902306}}</ref> from 1272 to 1349, when it was conquered by King [[Casimir III the Great]] of [[Kingdom of Poland|Poland]]. From 1434, it was the regional capital of the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]] in the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]. In 1772, after the [[First Partition of Poland]], the city became the capital of the Habsburg [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]. In 1918, for a short time, it was the capital of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]]. Between the wars, the city was the centre of the [[Lwów Voivodeship]] in the [[Second Polish Republic]]. After the German-Soviet [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, Lviv was annexed by the [[Soviet Union]].

The once-large [[Jews in Ukraine|Jewish]] community of the city was murdered in large numbers by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] and during [[The Holocaust in Ukraine|the Holocaust]]. For decades there was no working synagogue in Lviv after the final one [[USSR anti-religious campaign (1958–1964)|was closed by the Soviets]]. The greater part of the once-predominant Polish population was sent to Poland during a [[population exchange between Poland and Soviet Ukraine]] in 1944–46.

The historical heart of the city, with its cobblestone streets and architectural assortment of [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]], [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-classicism]] and [[Art Nouveau]], survived Soviet and German occupations during World War II largely unscathed. The [[Old Town (Lviv)|historic city centre]] is on the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Europe#Ukraine|UNESCO World Heritage List]]; however, it has been listed as an endangered site due to the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]]. Due to the city's Mediterranean aura, many [[Soviet movies]] set in places like [[Venice]] or [[Rome]] were actually shot in Lviv.<ref name="reise">Hermann Simon, Irene Stratenwerth, Ronald Hinrichs (Hrsg.): ''Lemberg. Eine Reise nach Europa''. {{Google books|KFbmtdibpIMC|S. 96 ff.|page=96}}</ref> [[Ukrainian declaration of independence|In 1991]], Lviv became part of the independent nation of Ukraine.

The city has many industries and institutions of [[higher education]], such as [[Lviv University]] and [[Lviv Polytechnic]]. Lviv is also the home of many cultural institutions, including a philharmonic orchestra and the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Archives |url=http://www.meest-tour.com/index.php?id=17 |url-status=live |access-date=24 March 2021 |archive-date=25 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225032259/http://www.meest-tour.com/index.php?id=17}}</ref>

==Names and symbols==
The city of Lviv is also historically known by different names in other languages – {{langx|pl|Lwów}} {{IPA|pl|lvuf||Pl-Lwów.ogg}}; {{langx|de|Lemberg}} {{IPA|de|ˈlɛmbɛʁk||De-Lemberg.ogg}} or (archaic)  ''Leopoldstadt'' {{IPA|de|ˈleːopɔltˌʃtat||De-Leopoldstadt.ogg}}; {{langx|yi|לעמבעריק|Lemberik}}; {{langx|ru|Львов|Lvov}} {{IPA|ru|lʲvof|}}; as well as [[Names of European cities in different languages: I–L#Lviv|a number of other names]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Fellerer |first=Jan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2vjHDwAAQBAJ |title=Urban Multilingualism in East-Central Europe: The Polish Dialect of Late-Habsburg Lviv |date=15 January 2020 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1-4985-8015-1 |access-date=19 November 2022 |archive-date=6 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230406065450/https://books.google.com/books?id=2vjHDwAAQBAJ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[coat of arms]], the banner of the Lviv City Council and the logo, are the officially approved symbols of Lviv. The names or images of architectural and historical monuments are also considered symbols of the city by the Statute of Lviv.<ref>{{cite web |title=Statute of Lviv |url=http://lvivrada.gov.ua/files/statut/Preambula_R1.pdf |url-status=live |access-date=24 March 2021 |archive-date=27 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127062809/http://lvivrada.gov.ua/files/statut/Preambula_R1.pdf}}</ref>

Lviv's modern coat of arms is based on the coat of arms from the city seal in the middle of the 14th century—a stone gate with three towers, and in the opening of the gate walks a golden lion. Lviv's large coat of arms is a shield, with the coat of arms of the city, crowned with a silver crown with three edges, held by a lion and an ancient warrior.

Lviv's flag is a blue square banner with an image of the city emblem and with yellow and blue triangles at the edges.

Lviv's logo is an image of five colorful towers in Lviv and the slogan "Lviv — open to the world" under them.<ref>{{cite web |title=Heraldry |url=http://www.lviv.ua/uk/about/heraldry/ |url-status=dead |access-date=24 March 2021 |archive-date=22 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122224547/http://www.lviv.ua/uk/about/heraldry/}}</ref> The Latin phrase ''[[Semper fidelis]]'' ('Always faithful') was used as a motto on the former coat of arms of 1936–1939, but was no longer used after the [[Second World War]].

==Geography==
[[File:Lviv City, Ukraine, Sentinel-2 satellite image, 30-AUG-2017.jpg|thumb|left|A satellite view of Lviv ([[Sentinel-2]], <br />14 August 2017)]]
Lviv is on the edge of the [[Roztocze|Roztochia Upland]], about {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=off}} east of the Polish border and {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the eastern [[Carpathian Mountains]]. The average altitude of Lviv is {{convert|296|m|ft|abbr=off}} above [[sea level]]. Its highest point is the ''Vysokyi Zamok'' ([[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]]), {{convert|409|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. This castle has a commanding view of the historic city centre with its distinctive green-domed churches and intricate architecture.

The old [[Defensive wall|walled city]] was at the foothills of the High Castle on the banks of the [[Poltva River]]. In the 13th century, the river was used to transport goods. In the early 20th century, the Poltva was covered over in areas where it flows through the city; the river flows directly beneath Lviv's central street, {{ill|Liberty Avenue (Lviv)|lt=Liberty Avenue|uk|Проспект Свободи (Львів)}}, and the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]].

===Kingdom of Poland===
[[File:Lviv High Castle (Engraving).jpg|thumb|[[Lviv High Castle]] first built in 1250 by [[Leo I of Halych]] and rebuilt in 1362 by [[Casimir III of Poland]] (engraving by A. Gogenberg, 17th century)]]

In 1349, the [[Kingdom of Ruthenia]] with its capital Lviv was annexed by the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]]. The kingdom was transformed into the Ruthenian domain of the Crown with Lviv as the capital. On 17 June 1356 King [[Casimir III the Great]] granted it [[Magdeburg rights]], which implied that all city matters were to be resolved by a council elected by the wealthy citizens. In 1362, the [[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]] was completely rebuilt with stone replacing the previous wood. In 1358, the city became a seat of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv|Roman Catholic Archdiocese]], which initiated the spread of [[Latin Church]] onto the Ruthenian lands.

After Casimir had died in 1370, he was succeeded as king of Poland by his nephew, King [[Louis I of Hungary]], who in 1372 put Lviv together with the region of [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]] under the administration of his relative [[Vladislaus II of Opole]], Duke of Opole.<ref name="Meyers Konversations-Lexikon" /> When in 1387 Władysław retreated from the post of its governor, Galicia-Volhynia became occupied by [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], but soon [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]], the youngest daughter of Louis, and also the ruler of Poland and wife of King of Poland [[Władysław II Jagiełło]], unified it directly with the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]].<ref name="Meyers Konversations-Lexikon" />

The city's prosperity during the following centuries is owed to the trade privileges granted to it by Casimir, Queen [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]], and the subsequent Polish monarchs.<ref name="Meyers Konversations-Lexikon" /> Germans, Poles and Czechs formed the largest groups of newcomers. Most of the settlers were [[Polonization|polonised]] by the end of the 15th century, and the city became a Polish island surrounded by the Ruthenian [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] population.<ref>Jerzy Lukowski, Hubert Zawadzki.

In 1412, the local archdiocese has developed into the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv|Roman Catholic Metropolis]], which since 1375 as diocese had been in [[Halych]].<ref name="Meyers Konversations-Lexikon" /> The new metropolis included regional diocese in Lviv, [[Przemyśl]], [[Chełm]], [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi|Włodzimierz]], [[Lutsk|Łuck]], [[Kamianets-Podilskyi|Kamieniec]], as well as [[Siret]] and [[Kyiv|Kijów]] (see [[Old Cathedral of St. Sophia, Kyiv]]). The first Catholic Archbishop who resided in Lviv was Jan Rzeszowski.

[[File:Львов 1618 АГогенберг.jpg|thumb|Lwów in a lithograph from 1618]]
In 1434, the Ruthenian domain of the Crown was transformed into the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]]. In 1444, the city was granted the [[staple right]], which resulted in its growing prosperity and wealth, as it became one of the major trading centres on the merchant routes between [[Central Europe]] and [[Black Sea]] region. It was also transformed into one of the main fortresses of the kingdom. As one of the largest and most influential [[royal city|royal cities]] of Poland, it enjoyed voting rights in the [[Royal elections in Poland]], alongside other major cities such as [[Kraków]], [[Poznań]], [[Warsaw]] or [[Gdańsk]].<ref>''Polska Encyklopedia Szlachecka'', t. I, Warsaw 1935, p. 42</ref> During the 17th century, it was the second largest city of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], with a population of about 30,000.

In 1572, one of the first publishers of books in what is now Ukraine, [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]], a graduate of the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Kraków]], settled here for a brief period. The city became a significant centre for [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] with the establishment of an Orthodox brotherhood, a Greek-Slavonic school, and a printer which published the first full versions of the Bible in [[Church Slavonic]] in 1580. A [[List of Jesuit educational institutions in the Philippines|Jesuit Collegium]] was founded in 1608, and on 20 January 1661 King [[John II Casimir]] of Poland issued a decree granting it "the honour of the academy and the title of the university".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.manresa-sj.org/stamps/2_Ukraine.htm |title=Jesuits in Ukraine |website=www.manresa-sj.org |access-date=7 March 2022 |archive-date=7 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220307223326/https://www.manresa-sj.org/stamps/2_Ukraine.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city itself was not sacked due to the fact that the leader of the revolution [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] accepted a ransom of 250,000 ducats, and the Cossacks marched north-west towards [[Zamość]]. It was one of two major cities in Poland which was not captured during the so-called [[Deluge (history)|''Deluge'']]: the other one was [[Gdańsk]].{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

At that time, Lviv witnessed a historic scene, as here King [[John II Casimir Vasa|John II Casimir]] made his famous [[Lwów Oath]]. On 1 April 1656, during a holy mass in Lviv's Cathedral conducted by the [[papal legate]] [[Pietro Vidoni]], John Casimir in a grandiose and elaborate ceremony entrusted the Commonwealth under the Blessed Virgin Mary's protection, whom he announced as ''The Queen of the Polish Crown and other of his countries''. He also swore to ''protect the Kingdom's folk from any impositions and unjust bondage''.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

Two years later, John Casimir, in honor of the bravery of its residents, declared Lviv to be equal to two historic capitals of the Commonwealth, Kraków and [[Vilnius]].{{citation needed|date=January 2022}} In the same year, 1658, [[Pope Alexander VII]] declared the city to be [[Semper fidelis]], in recognition of its key role in defending Europe and Roman Catholicism from the Ottoman Muslim invasion.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

In 1672 it was surrounded by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] who also failed to conquer it. Three years later, the [[Battle of Lwów (1675)]] took place near the city. Lviv was captured for the first time since the [[Middle Ages]] by a foreign army in 1704 when [[Swedish Army|Swedish troops]] under King [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] entered the city after a short siege.<ref>{{cite EB9 |wstitle = Lemberg |volume= XIV |last= |first= |author-link= | page=453 |short=1}}</ref> The [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|plague]] of the early 18th century caused the death of about 10,000 inhabitants (40% of the city's population).<ref>Karl-Erik Frandsen.

During Habsburg rule, Lviv became one of the most important Polish, Ukrainian and Jewish cultural centres. In Lviv, according to the Austrian census of 1910, which listed religion and language, 51% of the city's population was [[Roman Catholics]], 28% Jews, and 19% belonged to the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. Linguistically, 86% of the city's population used the [[Polish language]] and 11% preferred [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]].<ref name="New International" />

In 1784, a [[Latin language]] university was opened with lectures in [[German language|German]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and even [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]]; after closing in 1805, it was reopened in 1817.

During the 19th century, the Austrian administration attempted to [[Germanisation|Germanise]] the city's educational and governmental institutions. Many cultural organisations which did not have a pro-German orientation were closed. After the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|revolutions of 1848]], the language of instruction at the university shifted from German to include Ukrainian and Polish. Around that time, a certain [[sociolect]] developed in the city known as the [[Lwów dialect]]. Considered to be a type of Polish dialect, it draws its roots from numerous other languages besides Polish. In 1853, [[kerosene lamp]]s as [[street light]]ing were introduced by [[Ignacy Łukasiewicz]] and Jan Zeh. Then in 1858, these were updated to [[Gas lighting|gas lamps]], and in 1900 to [[Electric light|electric ones]].

After the so-called "[[Ausgleich]]" of February 1867, the [[Austrian Empire]] was reformed into a dualist [[Austria-Hungary]] and a slow yet steady process of liberalisation of Austrian rule in Galicia started. From 1873, Galicia was ''de facto'' an autonomous province of [[Austria-Hungary]], with Polish and [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] as official languages. [[Germanisation]] was halted and censorship lifted as well. [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] was subject to the Austrian part of the Dual Monarchy, but the [[Diet of Galicia|Galician Sejm]] and provincial administration, both established in Lviv, had extensive privileges and prerogatives, especially in education, culture, and local affairs. In 1894, the [[General National Exhibition in Lviv|General National Exhibition]] was held in Lviv.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://lia.lvivcenter.org/en/storymaps/exhibition-after/ |title=The General Regional Exhibition of Galicia |access-date=22 December 2020 |archive-date=26 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210126151938/https://lia.lvivcenter.org/en/storymaps/exhibition-after/ |url-status=live}}</ref> The city started to grow rapidly, becoming the fourth largest in Austria-Hungary, according to the census of 1910. Many [[Belle Époque]] public edifices and tenement houses were erected, with many of the buildings from the Austrian period, such as the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]], built in the [[Vienna|Viennese]] neo-Renaissance style.

[[File:Sejm Galicyjski.jpg|thumb|[[Diet of Galicia|The Galician Sejm]] (until 1918), since 1920 the [[Jan Kazimierz University]]]]

At that time, Lviv was home to a number of renowned Polish-language institutions, such as the [[Ossolineum]], with the second-largest collection of Polish books in the world, the [[Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences|Polish Academy of Arts]], the [[National Museum of Poland|National Museum]] (since 1908), the Historical Museum of the City of Lwów (since 1891), the [[Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists]], the [[Polish Historical Society]], [[Lviv University|Lwów University]], with Polish as the official language since 1882, the [[Lwów Scientific Society]], the [[Lviv National Art Gallery|Lwów Art Gallery]], the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Polish Theatre]], and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv|Polish Archdiocese]].

Furthermore, Lviv was the centre of a number of Polish independence organisations. In June 1908, [[Józef Piłsudski]], [[Władysław Sikorski]] and [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]] founded here the [[Union of Active Struggle]]. Two years later, the paramilitary organisation, called the [[Riflemen's Association]], was also founded in the city by Polish activists.

At the same time, Lviv became the city where famous Ukrainian writers (such as [[Ivan Franko]], [[Panteleimon Kulish]] and [[Ivan Nechuy-Levytsky]]) published their work. It was a centre of Ukrainian cultural revival. The city also housed the largest and most influential Ukrainian institutions in the world, including the [[Prosvita]] society dedicated to spreading literacy in the Ukrainian language, the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]], the Dniester Insurance Company and base of the [[Ukrainian cooperative movement]], and it served as the seat of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic Church]]. However, the Polish-dominated city council blocked Ukrainian attempts to create visible monumets for their own. The most important streets had names referring to Polish history and literature, and only minor roads referred to Ukrainians.<ref>{{cite book|author-last=Mick|author-first=Christoph|chapter=Lemberg/Lwów/L'viv - die multiethnische Stadt|editor=Matthias Weber, Burkhard Olschowsky, Ivan Petranský, Attila Pók, Andrzej Przewoźnik|title=Erinnerungsorte in Ostmitteleuropa: Erfahrungen der Vergangenheit und Perspektiven|publisher=Oldenbourg|year= 2011|language=de|pages=127}}</ref>

Lviv was also a major centre of Jewish culture, in particular as a centre of the [[Yiddish language]], and was the home of the world's first Yiddish-language daily newspaper, the ''Lemberger Togblat'', established in 1904.<ref>Paul Robert Magocsi.

====First World War====
[[File:Lemberg 1915 Mariyska.jpg|thumb|right|Lemberg (Lviv, Lwów) in 1915]]
In the [[Battle of Galicia]] at the early stages of the [[First World War]], Lviv was captured by the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian army]] in September 1914 following the [[Battle of Gnila Lipa]]. The Lemberg Fortress fell on 3 September. The historian [[Pál Kelemen]] provided a first-hand account of the chaotic evacuation of the city by the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] and civilians alike.<ref>{{cite web |title=03 September 1914 – The Fall Of Lemberg |url=http://ww1blog.osborneink.com/?p=607 |website=The Great War Blog |date=3 September 2014 |access-date=9 July 2016 |archive-date=6 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806184945/http://ww1blog.osborneink.com/?p=607 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The town was retaken by [[Austria-Hungary]] in June the following year during the [[Gorlice–Tarnów offensive]]. Lviv and its population, therefore, suffered greatly during the First World War as many of the offensives were fought across its local geography causing significant [[collateral damage]] and disruption.<ref name="PB2">{{cite book |last1=Buttar |first1=Prit |title=Germany Ascendant, The Eastern Front 1915 |date=2017 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location=Oxford |isbn=9781472819376 |pages=260–263}}</ref>

After the [[Dissolution of Austria-Hungary|collapse of the Habsburg Monarchy]] at the end of the First World War, Lviv became an arena of battle between the local Polish population and the [[Ukrainian Sich Riflemen]]. Both nations perceived the city as an integral part of their new statehoods which at that time were forming in the former Austrian territories. On the night of 31 October – 1 November 1918 the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic|Western Ukrainian People's Republic]] was proclaimed with Lviv as its capital. 2,300 Ukrainian soldiers from the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen (Sichovi Striltsi), which had previously been a corps in the Austrian Army, made an attempt to take over Lviv. The city's Polish majority opposed the Ukrainian declaration and began to fight against the Ukrainian troops.<ref>Timothy Snyder, ''The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569–1999'', Yale University Press, 2003, p.158</ref> During this combat an important role was taken by young Polish city defenders called [[Lwów Eaglets]].

The Ukrainian forces withdrew outside Lwów's confines by 21 November 1918, after which elements of Polish soldiers began to loot and burn much of the Jewish and Ukrainian quarters of the city, killing approximately 340 civilians (see: [[Lwów pogrom (1918)|Lwów pogrom]]).<ref name="ND">Norman Davies.

The Polish forces aided from central Poland, including [[Józef Haller|General Haller's]] [[Blue Army (Poland)|Blue Army]], equipped by the French, relieved the besieged city in May 1919 forcing the UHA to the east.

Despite [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] mediation attempts to cease hostilities and reach a compromise between belligerents the [[Polish–Ukrainian War]] continued until July 1919 when the last UHA forces withdrew east of the [[Zbruch River|River Zbruch]]. The border on the River Zbruch was confirmed at the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]], when in April 1920 Field [[Józef Piłsudski|Marshal Piłsudski]] signed an agreement with [[Symon Petliura|Symon Petlura]] where it was agreed that in exchange for military support against [[Bolsheviks|the Bolsheviks]] the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] renounced its claims to the territories of Eastern Galicia.

In August 1920, Lviv was attacked by the [[Red Army]] under the command of [[Alexander Ilyich Yegorov|Aleksandr Yegorov]] and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] during the [[Polish–Soviet War]] but [[Battle of Lwów (1920)|the city repelled the attack]].<ref>Norman Davies, White Eagle, [[Red star]]. Polish-Soviet War</ref> For the courage of its inhabitants Lviv was awarded the [[Virtuti Militari]] cross by Józef Piłsudski on 22 November 1920.

On 23 February 1921, the council of the [[League of Nations]] declared that Galicia (including the city) lay outside the territory of Poland and that Poland did not have the mandate to establish administrative control in that country, and that Poland was merely the occupying military power of Galicia (as a whole<ref name="MagocsiB" />), whose sovereign remained the [[Allied and Associated Powers|Allied Powers]] and fate would be determined by the [[Council of Ambassadors]] at the League of Nations.<ref>''Ukraine: A Concise Encyclopedia'' (1963).

===Interwar period===
[[File:Lwów.Panorama miasta.jpg|thumb|A panorama of Lwów before 1924]]
During the [[interwar period]] Lviv was the [[Second Polish Republic]]'s third-most populous city (following [[Warsaw]] and [[Łódź]]), and it became the seat of the [[Lwów Voivodeship]]. Following Warsaw, Lviv was the second most important cultural and academic centre of interwar Poland. For example, in 1920 Professor [[Rudolf Weigl]] of Lwów University developed a [[Typhus vaccine|vaccine]] against [[typhus fever]]. Furthermore, the geographic location of Lviv gave it an important role in stimulating international trade and fostering the city's and Poland's economic development. A major [[trade fair]] named [[Targi Wschodnie]] was established in 1921. In the academic year 1937–1938, there were 9,100 students attending five institutions of higher education, including [[Lviv University|Lwów University]] as well as the [[Lviv Polytechnic|Polytechnic]].<ref>''Mały Rocznik Statystyczny 1939'' (Polish statistical yearbook of 1939), [[Central Statistical Office (Poland)]], Warsaw, 1939.</ref>

While about two-thirds of the city's inhabitants were Poles, some of whom spoke the characteristic [[Lwów dialect]], the eastern part of the Lwów Voivodeship had a relative [[Demographics of Ukraine|Ukrainian]] majority in most of its rural areas. Although Polish authorities were obliged through international agreements to provide [[Eastern Galicia]] with autonomy (including the creation of a separate Ukrainian university in Lviv), and even though in September 1922 the [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Polish Sejm]]'s Bill was enacted,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/Ustawa_o_zasadach_powszechnego_samorz%C4%85du_wojew%C3%B3dzkiego |title=Text of the 1922 Bill (in Polish) |language=pl |publisher=Pl.wikisource.org |date=29 February 2012 |access-date=3 May 2012 |archive-date=2 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502230934/http://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/Ustawa_o_zasadach_powszechnego_samorz%C4%85du_wojew%C3%B3dzkiego |url-status=live}}</ref> this was not fulfilled.

The Polish government discontinued many Ukrainian schools which functioned during the Austrian rule,<ref name=Magosci>{{cite book |author=Magosci, R. |title=A History of Ukraine |location=Toronto |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1996}}</ref> and closed down Ukrainian departments at the University of Lwów with the exception of one.<ref name=Subtelny>{{cite book |last=Subtelny |first=Orest |title=Ukraine: A History |location=Toronto |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1988}}</ref> Prewar Lviv also had a large and thriving [[Jews|Jewish community]], which constituted about a quarter of the population, but were accused of having collaborated with the Ukrainians.<ref name="Oldenbourg">{{cite book|author-last=Mick|author-first=Christoph|chapter=Lemberg/Lwów/L'viv - die multiethnische Stadt|editor=Matthias Weber, Burkhard Olschowsky, Ivan Petranský, Attila Pók, Andrzej Przewoźnik|title=Erinnerungsorte in Ostmitteleuropa: Erfahrungen der Vergangenheit und Perspektiven|publisher=Oldenbourg|year= 2011|language=de|pages=130}}</ref>

Unlike in Austrian times, when the size and number of public parades or other cultural expressions corresponded to each cultural group's relative population, the Polish government emphasised the Polish nature of the city and limited public displays of [[Jewish culture|Jewish]] and [[Ukrainian culture]].{{citation needed|date=May 2024}} Military parades and commemorations of battles at particular streets within the city, all celebrating the Polish forces who fought against the Ukrainians in 1918, became frequent,<ref name="Oldenbourg"/> and in the 1930s a vast [[Cemetery of the Defenders of Lwów|memorial monument and burial ground of Polish soldiers]] from that conflict was built in the city's [[Lychakiv Cemetery]].

Germans during the occupation of the city committed numerous atrocities including the [[Massacre of Lwów professors|killing of Polish university professors]] in 1941. German Nazis viewed the Ukrainian Galicians, former inhabitants of Austrian Crown Land, as to some point more [[aryan]]ised and civilised than the Ukrainian population living in the territories belonging to the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] before 1939. As a result, they escaped the full extent of German acts in comparison to Ukrainians who lived to the east, in the German-occupied [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine]] turned into the ''[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]''.<ref name="auto"/>

According to the [[The Holocaust|Third Reich's racial policies]], local Jews then became the main target of German repressions in the region. Following the German occupation, the Jewish population was concentrated in the [[Lwów Ghetto]] established in the city's Zamarstynów (today ''[[Zamarstyniv]]'') district and the [[Janowska concentration camp]] was also set up. In the Janowska concentration camp, the Nazis conducted torture and executions to music. The [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Lviv National Opera]] members, who were prisoners, played one and the same tune, Tango of Death.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

On the eve of Lviv's liberation, German Nazis ordered 40 orchestra musicians to form a circle. The security ringed the musicians tightly and ordered them to play. First, the orchestra conductor, Mund, was executed. Then the commandant ordered the musicians to come to the center of the circle one by one, put their instruments onto the ground and strip naked, after which they were killed by a headshot.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}} A [[Tango of Death (orchestra)|photo of the orchestra players]] was one of the incriminating documents at the [[Nuremberg trials]].

In 1931 there were 75,316 [[Yiddish]]-speaking inhabitants, but by 1941 approximately 100,000 Jews were present in Lviv.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/media_cm.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005171&MediaId=1581 |title=Lvov 1939–1944 Timeline |work=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506162225/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/media_cm.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005171&MediaId=1581 |archive-date=6 May 2009}}</ref> The majority of these Jews were either killed within the city or deported to [[Belzec extermination camp]].

Later, on 19 November 1943, inmates at Janowska staged an uprising and attempted a mass escape. A few succeeded, but most were recaptured and killed. The [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] staff and their local auxiliaries then, at the time of the Janowska camp's liquidation, murdered at least 6,000 more inmates, as well as the [[Jews]] in other forced labour camps in Galicia.

====Soviet re-occupation====

[[File:RKKA Lviv.jpg|thumb|Soviet soldiers in Lviv, July 1944]]
After the successful [[Lvov–Sandomierz offensive|Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive]] of July 1944, the Soviet [[3rd Guards Tank Army]] captured Lwów on 27 July 1944, with significant cooperation from the local Polish resistance. Soon thereafter, the local commanders of Polish ''[[Armia Krajowa]]'' were invited to a meeting with the commanders of the Red Army. During the meeting, they were arrested, as it turned out to be a trap set by the Soviet NKVD. Later, in the winter and spring of 1945, the local NKVD continued to arrest and harass Poles in Lwów (which according to Soviet sources on 1 October 1944 still had a clear Polish majority of 66.7%) in an attempt to encourage their emigration from the city.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite book |last=Reynolds |first=David |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/646810103 |title=Summits : six meetings that shaped the twentieth century |date=2009 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-7867-4458-9 |location=New York |oclc=646810103 |access-date=15 October 2021 |archive-date=15 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220315054840/https://www.worldcat.org/title/summits-six-meetings-that-shaped-the-twentieth-century/oclc/646810103 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Those arrested were released only after they had signed papers in which they agreed to emigrate to Poland, which postwar borders were [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|to be shifted westwards]] in accordance with the [[Yalta conference]] settlements. In Yalta, despite Polish objections, the Allied leaders, [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]] decided that Lwów should remain within the borders of the Soviet Union. Roosevelt wanted Poland to have Lwów and the surrounding [[Petroleum reservoir|oilfields]], but Stalin refused to allow it.<ref name="auto1"/>

On 16 August 1945, a border agreement<ref>[[:pl:wikisource:Umowa graniczna pomiędzy Polską a ZSRR z 16 sierpnia 1945 roku]] [http://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/Umowa_graniczna_pomi%C4%99dzy_Polsk%C4%85_a_ZSRR_z_16_sierpnia_1945_roku] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118182630/http://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/Umowa_graniczna_pomi%C4%99dzy_Polsk%C4%85_a_ZSRR_z_16_sierpnia_1945_roku |date=18 November 2009 }} full text of the agreement {{in lang|pl}}</ref> was signed in Moscow between the [[government of the Soviet Union]] and the [[Provisional Government of National Unity]] installed by the Soviets in Poland. In the treaty, Polish authorities formally [[cession|ceded]] the prewar eastern part of the country to the Soviet Union, agreeing to the Polish-Soviet border to be drawn according to the [[Curzon Line]]. Consequently, the agreement was [[ratification|ratified]] on 5 February 1946.

=== Soviet Era ===
 
In February 1946, Lviv became a part of the Soviet Union. It is estimated that from 100,000 to 140,000 Poles were resettled from the city into the so-called [[Recovered Territories]] as a part of [[Population transfer#Central Europe|postwar population transfers]], many of them to the area of newly acquired [[Wrocław]], formerly the German city of Breslau. Many buildings in the old part of the city are examples of [[Architecture of Poland|Polish architecture]], which flourished in Lviv after the opening of the Technical School (later Polytechnic), the first higher-education technical academy in Polish lands. Polytechnic educated generations of architects who were influential in the entire country. Examples are: the main buildings of [[Lviv Polytechnic]], [[University of Lviv]], [[Lviv Opera]], [[Lviv railway station]], former building of Galicyjska Kasa Oszczędności, [[Potocki Palace, Lviv|Potocki Palace]].<ref>Ihor Zhuk, 'The Architecture of Lviv from the Thirteenth to the Twentieth Centuries', s. 113</ref>
[[File:Lviv. Former Jewish Quarter of Suburb.jpg|thumb|View on the Opera Theatre and Hotel Lviv in the late 1960s]]
During the interwar period, Lviv was striving to become a modern metropolis, so architects experimented with modernism. It was the period of the most rapid growth of the city, so one can find many examples of architecture from this time in the city.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Examples include the main building of [[Lviv Academy of Commerce]], the second Sprecher's building or building of City Electrical Facilities.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} One monument of the Polish past is the [[Adam Mickiewicz Monument, Lviv|Adam Mickiewicz Monument]] at the square bearing his name.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Many Polish pieces of art and sculpture can be found in Lviv galleries, among them works by [[Jan Piotr Norblin]], [[Marcello Bacciarelli]], [[Kazimierz Wojniakowski]], [[Antoni Brodowski]], [[Henryk Rodakowski]], [[Artur Grottger]], [[Jan Matejko]], [[Aleksander Gierymski]], [[Jan Stanisławski (painter)|Jan Stanisławski]], [[Leon Wyczółkowski]], [[Józef Chełmoński]], [[Józef Mehoffer]], [[Stanisław Wyspiański]], [[Olga Boznańska]], [[Władysław Słowiński]], [[Jacek Malczewski]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Poles who stayed in Lviv have formed the organisation the [[Association of Polish Culture of the Lviv Land]].

According to various estimates, Lviv lost between 80% and 90% of its prewar population.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Törnquist-Plewa |editor1-first=Barbara |title=Whose Memory? Which Future?: Remembering Ethnic Cleansing and Lost Cultural Diversity in Eastern, Central and Southeastern Europe |date=2016 |publisher=Berghahn Books |isbn=978-1-78533-122-0 |page=74}}</ref> Expulsion of the Polish population and [[the Holocaust]] together with migration from [[Ukrainophone|Ukrainian-speaking]] surrounding areas (including forcibly resettled from the territories which, after the war, became part of the Polish People's Republic), from other parts of the Soviet Union, altered the ethnic composition of the city. Immigration from Russia and Russian-speaking regions of Eastern Ukraine was encouraged{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}. The prevalence of the Ukrainian-speaking population has led to the fact that under the conditions of Soviet Russification,{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Lviv became a major centre of the [[Dissident movement in the Soviet Union|dissident movement in Ukraine]] and played a key role in Ukraine's independence in 1991.

In the 1950s and 1960s, the city expanded both in population and size mostly due to the city's rapidly growing industrial base. Due to the fight of [[SMERSH]] with the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]], Lviv obtained a nickname with a negative connotation of ''Banderstadt'' as the City of [[Stepan Bandera]]. The German suffix for the city ''stadt'' was added instead of the Russian ''[[Grad (toponymy)|grad]]'' to imply alienation. Over the years the residents of the city found this so ridiculous that even people not familiar with Bandera accepted it as sarcasm in reference to the Soviet perception of [[western Ukraine]]. In the period of [[Perestroika|liberalisation from the Soviet system]] in the 1980s, the city became the centre of political movements advocating [[Modern history of Ukraine|Ukrainian independence]] from the USSR. By the time of the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] the name became a proud mark for the Lviv natives culminating in the creation of a local rock band under the name ''Khloptsi z Bandershtadtu'' (Boys from Banderstadt).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bandershtadt.w6.ru/ |title=Official site of the Khloptsi z Bandershtadtu |publisher=Bandershtadt.w6.ru |access-date=3 May 2012 |archive-date=14 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414164419/http://bandershtadt.w6.ru/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 17 September 1989 Lviv saw the largest rally in support of Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union, gathering some 100,000 participants.<ref name="cnn1803">{{cite news |title=Russia has attacked Lviv.

===Independent Ukraine===
[[File:Lviv street scene 20041126.jpg|thumb|Protesters in Lviv during the 2004 presidential election]]
Citizens of Lviv strongly supported [[Viktor Yushchenko]] during the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election]] and played a key role in the [[Orange Revolution]]. Hundreds of thousands of people would gather in freezing temperatures to demonstrate for the Orange camp. Acts of [[civil disobedience]] forced the head of the local police to resign and the local assembly issued a resolution refusing to accept the fraudulent first official results.<ref>{{cite news |last=Tchorek |first=Kamil |title=Protest grows in western city |work=Times Online |date=26 November 2004 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article395652.ece |access-date=25 July 2009 |archive-date=29 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629121745/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article395652.ece |url-status=dead }}</ref> Lviv remains today one of the main centres of Ukrainian culture and the origin of much of the nation's political class.

In support of the [[Euromaidan]] movement, Lviv's executive committee declared itself independent of the rule of President [[Viktor Yanukovych]] on 19 February 2014.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ukraine-facing-civil-war-lviv-declares-independence-yanukovich-rule-1437092 |title=Ukraine Facing Civil War: Lviv Declares Independence from Yanukovich Rule |last=Gianluca Mezzofiore |date=19 February 2014 |work=International Business Times |access-date=19 February 2014 |archive-date=1 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201194141/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ukraine-facing-civil-war-lviv-declares-independence-yanukovich-rule-1437092 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2019 citizens of Lviv supported [[Petro Poroshenko]] during the [[2019 Ukrainian presidential election]]. The percentage of votes counted for Poroshenko was more than 90%. Despite this level of support in Lviv, he lost the national vote.

Until 18 July 2020, Lviv was incorporated as a [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]] and the center of [[Lviv Municipality]]. The municipality was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Lviv Oblast to seven. The area of Lviv Municipality was merged into the newly established Lviv Raion.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Про утворення та ліквідацію районів.

Ethnic Poles and the [[Polish Jews]] began to settle in Lwów in considerable numbers already in 1349 after the city was conquered by [[Casimir III the Great|King Casimir]] of the [[Piast dynasty]]. Lwów served as Poland's major cultural and economic centre for several centuries, during the [[Polish Golden Age]], and until the [[partitions of Poland]] perpetrated by Russia, Prussia, and Austria.<ref>{{cite news |title=In Poland, a Jewish Revival Thrives |quote=Probably about 70 percent of the world's European Jews, or [[Ashkenazi]], can trace their ancestry to Poland – thanks to a 14th-century king, Casimir III the Great, who drew Jewish settlers from across Europe with his vow to protect them as "people of the king". |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=12 July 2007}}</ref> In the [[Second Polish Republic]], the [[Lwów Voivodeship]] (inhabited by 2,789,000 people in 1921) grew to 3,126,300 inhabitants in ten years.<ref name="grodek">{{cite web |url=http://www.grodekjagiellonski.republika.pl/wojewodztwo.html |title=Województwo lwowskie. 1920–1939 |publisher=Grodek Jagiellonski |work=KALENDARIUM |date=2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308215808/http://www.grodekjagiellonski.republika.pl/wojewodztwo.html |archive-date=8 March 2012}}</ref>

As a result of World War II, Lviv was de-Polonised, mainly through [[Polish population transfers (1944–1946)|Soviet-arranged population exchange in 1944–1946]] but also by early deportations to Siberia.<ref name="loz">{{cite web |url=http://postup.brama.com/010928/148_8_1.html |author=R.

By 1959 Poles made up only 4% of the local population. Many families were mixed.<ref name=loz /> During the Soviet decades only two Polish schools continued to function: [[St. Mary Magdalene High School No. 10 in Lviv|No. 10]] (with 8 grades) and No. 24 (with 10 grades).<ref name=loz />

In the 1980s the process of uniting groups into ethnic associations was allowed. In 1988 a Polish-language newspaper was permitted (''[[Gazeta Lwowska]]'').<ref name="ir">[https://archive.today/20060118000349/http://www.polska.com.ua/ua/ambasada/news/3526/ Polish Embassy ''The Poles in Lviv continue to be proud of their identity''], accessed 21:05, 29 October 2009</ref> The Polish population of the city continues to use the dialect of the Polish language known as ''[[Lwów dialect]]'' ({{langx|pl|gwara lwowska}}).<ref name=ir />

===Jewish population===
The first known Jews in Lviv date back to the tenth century.<ref name="erasedvanishingtraces">{{cite book |last1=Bartov |first1=Omer |title=Erased: Vanishing Traces of Jewish Galicia in Present-Day Ukraine |date=2007 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, New Jersey |isbn=9780691131214 |oclc=123912559 |pages=13–41}}</ref> The oldest remaining Jewish tombstone dates back to 1348.<ref name="erasedvanishingtraces"/> Apart from the Rabbanite Jews there were many [[Crimean Karaites|Karaites]] who had settled in the city after coming from the East and from [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. After Casimir III conquered Lviv in 1349 the Jewish citizens received many privileges equal to that of other citizens of Poland. Lviv had two separate [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish quarters]], one within the city walls and one outside on the outskirts of the city. Each had its separate [[synagogue]], although they shared a cemetery, which was also used by the [[Crimean Karaite]] community. Before 1939 there were 97 synagogues.

Before the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] about one-third of the city's population was made up of Jews (more than 140,000 on the eve of World War II). This number swelled to about 240,000 by the end of 1940 as tens of thousands of Jews fled from the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|Nazi-occupied parts]] of Poland into the relative (and temporary) sanctuary of Soviet-occupied Poland (including Lviv) following the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] that divided Poland into Nazi and Soviet zones in 1939. Most of the Jewish population was killed in the Holocaust. Meanwhile, the Nazis also destroyed the Jewish cemetery, which was subsequently "paved over by the Soviets".<ref name="erasedvanishingtraces"/>

Due to the Holocaust and migration, the original Jewish population of the city all but vanished. After the war, the remnant was replenished by a newer Jewish population, formed from among the hundreds of thousands of Russians and Ukrainians who migrated to the city. The post-war Jewish population peaked at 30,000 in the 1970s. Currently, the Jewish population has shrunk considerably as a result of [[emigration]] (mainly to Israel and the United States) and, to a lesser degree, [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]], and is estimated to number a few thousand.<ref>{{cite web |title=L'viv entry |url=https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/lviv#id0e2jbk |access-date=18 November 2022 |archive-date=18 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221118135400/https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/lviv#id0e2jbk |url-status=live }}</ref> A number of organisations continue to be active.

There are several banks based in Lviv, such as Kredobank, Idea Bank, VS Bank, Oksi Bank and Lviv Bank. None of these banks have bankrupted during the political and economic crisis of 2014–2016. It can be explained by the presence of foreign capital in most of them.

Lviv is one of Ukraine's most important cultural centres. It is known as a centre of art, literature, music and theatre. Nowadays, the evidence of the city's cultural richness is the number of theatres, concert halls, and creative unions, and the high number of artistic activities (more than 100 festivals annually, 60 museums, and 10 theatres).

[[Old Town (Lviv)|Lviv's historic centre]] has been on the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage list]] since 1998. UNESCO gave the following reasons<ref name=":0">[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/865 L'viv&nbsp;– the Ensemble of the Historic Centre] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220224203848/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/865/ |date=24 February 2022 }}, UNESCO&nbsp;– World Heritage.

===Architecture===
Lviv's historic churches, buildings and relics date from the 13th century to the early 20th century (Polish and Austro-Hungarian rule). In recent centuries Lviv was spared some of the invasions and wars that destroyed other [[List of cities in Ukraine|Ukrainian cities]]. Its architecture reflects various European styles and periods. After the fires of 1527 and 1556 Lviv lost most of its [[gothic architecture|gothic]]-style buildings but it retains many buildings in [[renaissance architecture|renaissance]], [[baroque architecture|baroque]] and the [[classical architecture|classic]] styles. There are works by artists of the [[Vienna Secession]], [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]].

The buildings have many stone sculptures and carvings, particularly on large doors, which are hundreds of years old. The remains of old churches dot the central cityscape. Some three- to five-storey buildings have hidden inner courtyards and grottoes in various states of repair. Some cemeteries are of interest: for example, the [[Lychakiv Cemetery|Lychakivskiy Cemetery]] where the Polish elite was buried for centuries. Leaving the central area the [[architectural style]] changes radically as Soviet-era [[high-rise]] blocks dominate. In the centre of the city, the [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]] is reflected mainly in a few modern-style national monuments and sculptures.

===Monuments===

[[File:Chapel-of-Boim-family.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chapel of the Boim family]]]]

Outdoor sculptures in the city commemorate many notable individuals and topics reflecting the rich and complex [[history of Lviv]]. There are monuments to [[Adam Mickiewicz]], [[Ivan Franko]], [[Daniel of Galicia|King Danylo]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]], [[Solomiya Krushelnytska]], [[Ioan Potcoavă|Ivan Pidkova]], [[Mykhailo Hrushevskyi]], [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Jan Kiliński]], [[Ivan Trush]], [[Saint George]], [[Wojciech Bartosz Głowacki|Bartosz Głowacki]], the monument to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], to [[Nikifor]], [[The Good Soldier Švejk]], [[Stepan Bandera]], [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], and many others.

During the [[interwar period]] there were monuments commemorating important figures of Polish history. Some of them were moved to the Polish "[[Recovered Territories]]" after World War II, like the [[Aleksander Fredro Monument in Wrocław|Monument to Aleksander Fredro]], which now is in [[Wrocław]], the [[John III Sobieski Monument in Gdańsk|Monument of King John III Sobieski]], which after 1945 was moved to [[Gdańsk]], and the monument of [[Kornel Ujejski]], which is now in [[Szczecin]]. A book market takes place around the monument to [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fеdorovych]], a typographer in the 16th century who fled Moscow and found a new home in Lviv.

New ideas came to Lviv during Austro–Hungarian rule. In the 19th century, many [[publishing]] houses, newspapers and magazines were established. Among these was the [[Ossolineum]] which was one of the most important Polish scientific libraries. Most Polish-language books and publications of the Ossolineum library are still kept in a local [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] church. In 1997 the Polish government asked the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian government]] to return these documents to Poland. In 2003, Ukraine allowed access to these publications for the first time. In 2006, an office of the Ossolineum (now in [[Wrocław]]) opened in Lviv and began scanning all its documents. Works written in Lviv contributed to Austrian, [[Ukrainian literature|Ukrainian]], Yiddish, and [[Polish literature]], with a multitude of translations.

===Religion===
Lviv is a city of religious variety. [[Religion]] (2012): Catholic: 57% ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] 56% and [[Roman Catholic Church]] 1%), [[Orthodoxy#Christianity|Orthodox]]: 32%, [[Protestantism]]: 2%, [[Judaism]]: 0.1%, Other religion: 3%, Indifferent to religious matters: 4%, [[Atheism]]: 1.9%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://city-institute.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=231:who-is-he-the-citizen-of-lviv&catid=1:latest|title=Who is he, the citizen of Lviv?|date=29 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045226/http://city-institute.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=231:who-is-he-the-citizen-of-lviv&catid=1:latest |access-date=7 August 2023|archive-date=29 April 2014 }}</ref>

====Christianity====
At one point, over 60 churches existed in the city. Christian groups have existed in the city since the 13th century. The city has been the [[episcopal see]] of three different [[particular church]]es of [[Catholic Church]]: The [[Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Lviv]] of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv|Archdiocese of Lviv]] of the [[Latin Church]], and formerly the [[Armenian Catholic Church in Ukraine|Armenian Catholic Archeparchy of Lviv]] of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]]. Each has had a diocesan seat in Lviv since the 16th century. At the end of the 16th century, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] community in Ukraine [[Union of Brest|transferred their allegiance]] to the [[Pope]] in Rome and became the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. This bond was forcibly dissolved in 1946 by the Soviet authorities and the Roman Catholic community was forced out by the expulsion of the Polish population. Since 1989, religious life in Lviv has experienced a revival. About 35 percent of religious buildings belong to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, 11.5 percent to the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]], 9 per cent to the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate|Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyiv Patriarchate]] and 6 per cent to the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].

In June 2001, [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the [[Latin Cathedral, Lviv|Latin Cathedral]], [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]] and the [[Armenian Cathedral, Lviv|Armenian Cathedral]].

====Judaism====
Lviv historically had a large and active [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Jewish community]] and until 1941, at least 45 [[synagogue]]s and prayer houses existed. Even in the 16th century, two separate communities existed. One lived in today's old town with the other in the [[Krakowskie Przedmieście]]. The [[Golden Rose Synagogue (Lviv)|Golden Rose Synagogue]] was built in Lviv in 1582. In the 19th century, a more differentiated community started to spread out. [[Reform Judaism|Liberal Jews]] sought more [[cultural assimilation]] and spoke German and Polish. On the other hand, [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]] tried to retain the old traditions. Between 1941 and 1944, the Germans in effect completely destroyed the centuries-old Jewish tradition of Lviv. Most synagogues were destroyed and the Jewish population was forced first into a [[Nazi ghettos|ghetto]] before being forcibly transported to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] where they were murdered.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaust.kiev.ua/eng/seminarse/lviv.htm#vip2 |title=International Forum:"Challenge of Holocaust and Its Lessons" |work=Lviv Polytechnic National University Regional Holocaust Study Center: Ukrainian Holocaust History Study Center |date=November 2003 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308035832/http://www.holocaust.kiev.ua/eng/seminarse/lviv.htm |archive-date=8 March 2012}}</ref>

Under the Soviet Union, synagogues remained closed and were used as warehouses or cinemas. The last functioning synagogue was closed in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Entry for L'viv |url=https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/lviv |publisher=[[YIVO]] |access-date=16 November 2022 |archive-date=16 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221116213137/https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/lviv |url-status=live }}</ref> Only since the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]], has the remainder of the Jewish community experienced a faint revival.

Currently, the only functioning Orthodox Jewish synagogue in Lviv is the [[Beis Aharon V'Yisrael Synagogue]].

===Arts===
[[File:Lwowska Galeria Sztuki - Wnętrza 01.JPG|thumb|A room in the [[Lviv National Art Gallery]]]]

The range of artistic Lviv is impressive. On the one hand, it is the city of classical art. Lviv Opera and Lviv Philharmonic are places that can satisfy the demands of true appraisers of the classical arts. This is the city of one of the most distinguished sculptors in Europe, [[Johann Georg Pinsel|Johann Georg Pinzel]], whose works can be seen on the façade of the [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]] in Lviv and in the Pinzel Museum. This is also the city of [[Solomiya Krushelnytska]], who began her career as a singer in Lviv Opera and later became the prima donna of [[La Scala|La Scala Opera]] in [[Milan]].

The "Group Artes" was a young movement founded in 1929. Many of the artists studied in Paris and travelled throughout Europe. They worked and experimented in different areas of modern art: [[Futurism]], [[Cubism]], [[New Objectivity]] and [[Surrealism]]. Co–operation took place between avant-garde musicians and authors. Altogether thirteen exhibitions by "''Artes''" took place in Warsaw, Kraków, Łódz and Lviv. The German occupation put an end to this group. Otto Hahn was executed in 1942 in Lviv and Aleksander Riemer was murdered in Auschwitz in 1943.<ref>Kosmolinska, Natalia (2007). "[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFbmtdibpIMC&pg=PA224 Ein Fenster zur Moderne: Das Atelier der Sielskis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102033537/https://books.google.com/books?id=KFbmtdibpIMC&pg=PA224 |date=2 January 2016 }}." In: Hermann Simon, Irene Stratenwerth, & Ronald Hinrichs (Eds.), ''Lemberg: Eine Reise nach Europa'' Berlin: Christoph Links Verlag. pp. 218–227; here: p. 224.</ref>

Henryk Streng and [[Margit Reich-Sielska]] were able to escape the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] (or Shoah). Most of the surviving members of Artes lived in Poland after 1945. Only Margit Reich-Sielska (1900–1980) and Roman Sielski (1903–1990) stayed in Soviet Lviv. For years the city was one of the most important cultural centres of Poland with such writers as [[Aleksander Fredro]], [[Gabriela Zapolska]], [[Leopold Staff]], [[Maria Konopnicka]] and [[Jan Kasprowicz]] living in Lviv.

Today Lviv is a city of fresh ideas and unusual characters. There are about 20 galleries ([[Lviv Municipal Art Center]], [[Dzyga Art Center|The "Dzyga" Gallery]], Art-Gallery "Primus", Gallery of the History of Ukrainian Military Uniforms, Gallery of Modern Art "Zelena Kanapa" and others). [[Lviv National Art Gallery]] is the largest museum of arts in Ukraine, with approximately 50,000 artworks, including paintings, sculptures and works of graphic art from Western and Eastern Europe, from the Middle Ages to the modern days.

===Theatre and opera===
[[File:Lviv Opera House.jpg|thumb|The [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Lviv Opera and Ballet Theatre]], an important cultural centre for residents and visitors]]
In 1842 the [[Skarbek Theatre]] was opened making it the third-largest theatre in [[Central Europe]]. In 1903 the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Lviv National Opera]] house, which at that time was called the City-Theatre, was opened emulating the [[Vienna State Opera]] house. The house initially offered a changing repertoire such as classical dramas in German and [[Polish language]], opera, operetta, comedy and theatre.
The opera house is named after the Ukrainian opera diva [[Solomiya Krushelnytska|Salomea Krushelnytska]] who worked here.

In the [[Janowska concentration camp]], the Nazis conducted torture and executions to music. To do so they brought almost the whole Lviv National Opera to the camp. Professor Shtriks, opera conductor Mund and other famous Jewish musicians were among the members. From 1941 to 1944 the Nazis massacred 200,000 people including all 40 musicians.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Tango-Death-Story-Holocaust-Survivors/dp/B085HHMGMT/ |title=Tango of Death.

Nowadays [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]] has a large creative group of performers who strive to maintain traditions of Ukrainian opera and classical ballet. The Theatre is a well-organized creative body where over 500 people work towards a common goal. The repertoire includes 10 Ukrainian music compositions. No other similar theatre in Ukraine has such a large number of [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] productions. There are also many operas written by foreign composers, and most of these operas are performed in the original language: ''Othello'', ''Aida'', ''La Traviata'', ''Nabucco'', and ''A Masked Ball'' by G. Verdi, ''Tosca'', ''La Bohème'' and ''Madame Butterfly'' by G. Puccini, ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' by P. Mascagni, and ''Pagliacci'' by R. Leoncavallo (in Italian); ''Carmen'' by G. Bizet (in French), ''The Haunted Manor'' by S. Moniuszko (in Polish)

Museum Pharmacy "Pid Chornym Orlom" (Beneath the Black Eagle) was founded in 1735 – it is the oldest pharmacy in Lviv. A museum related to pharmaceutical history was opened on the premises of the old pharmacy in 1966. The idea of creating such a museum had already come up in the 19th century. The Galician Association of Pharmacists was created in 1868. Members managed to assemble a small collection of exhibits, thus making the first step towards creating a new museum. The exhibition space has expanded considerably, with 16 exhibit rooms and a general exhibition surface totalling 700 sq. m. There are more than 3,000 exhibits in the museum. This is the only operating Museum Pharmacy in Ukraine and Europe.

The most notable of the museums are [[Lviv National Museum]] which houses the National Gallery. Its collection includes more than 140,000 unique items. The museum takes special pride in presenting the largest and most complete collection of medieval sacral art of the 12th to 18th centuries: icons, manuscripts, rare ancient books, decoratively carved pieces of art, metal and plastic artworks, and fabrics embroidered with gold and silver. The museum also boasts a unique monument of [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style: the Bohorodchansky Iconostasis. Exhibits include Ancient Ukrainian art from the 12th to 15th centuries, Ukrainian art from the 16th to 18th centuries, and Ukrainian art from the end of the 18th to the beginning of the 20th century.

===Universities and academia===
[[File:Львівський університет ім, Франка.jpg|thumb|The front [[Facade|façade]] of the [[Lviv University]], the oldest university in Ukraine]]
[[Lviv University]] is one of the oldest in Central Europe and was founded as a [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuit) school in 1608. Its prestige greatly increased through the work of philosopher [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] (1866–1938) who was one of the founders of the [[Lwów-Warsaw School of Logic]]. This [[school of thought]] set benchmarks for academic research and [[education]] in Poland. The Polish politician of the interbellum period [[Stanisław Głąbiński]] had served as dean of the law department (1889–1890) and as the university rector (1908–1909). In 1901 the city was the seat of the [[Lwów Scientific Society]] among whose members were major scientific figures. The most well-known were the mathematicians [[Stefan Banach]], [[Juliusz Schauder]] and [[Stanislaw Ulam|Stanisław Ulam]] who were founders of the [[Lwów School of Mathematics]] turning Lviv in the 1930s into the "World Centre of Functional Analysis" and whose share in Lviv academia was substantial.

In 1852 in [[Dublany, Podlaskie Voivodeship|Dublany]] ({{cvt|8|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} from the outskirts of Lviv) the [[Agricultural Academy in Dublany|Agricultural Academy]] was opened and was one of the first Polish agricultural colleges. The academy was merged with the [[Lviv Polytechnic]] in 1919. Another important college of the interbellum period was the [[Academy of Foreign Trade in Lwów]].

In 1873 Lviv has founded [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]] from the beginning it attracted the financial and intellectual support of writers and patrons of [[Ukrainian culture|Ukrainian]] background.

In 1893 due to the change in its statute, the Shevchenko Scientific Society was transformed into a real scholarly multidisciplinary academy of sciences. Under the presidency of the historian, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], it greatly expanded its activities, contributing to both the humanities and the physical sciences, law and medicine, but most specifically once again it was concentrated on Ukrainian studies.
The Soviet Union annexed the eastern half of the Second Polish Republic including the city of Lwów which capitulated to the Red Army on 22 September 1939. Upon their occupation of Lviv, the Soviets dissolved the Shevchenko society. Many of its members were arrested and either imprisoned or executed.

The native residents of the city are jokingly known as the Lvivian [[batiar]]y (someone who's mischievous). Lvivians are also well known for their way of speaking that was greatly influenced by the [[Lwów dialect|Lvivian gwara]] (talk).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://balzatul.multiply.com/journal/item/1051 |title=Lviv dialect |publisher=Balzatul.multiply.com |access-date=3 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209084934/http://balzatul.multiply.com/journal/item/1051 |archive-date=9 February 2012}}</ref>

Lviv has established many city feasts, such as coffee and chocolate feasts, cheese & wine holiday, the feast of pampukh, the Day of Batyar, Annual Bread Day and others. Over 50 festivals happen in Lviv, such as [[Leopolis Jazz Fest]], an international jazz festival; the Leopolis Grand Prix, an international festival of vintage cars; international festival of academic music Virtuosi; Stare Misto Rock Fest; medieval festival Lviv Legend; international [[Etnovyr]] folklore festival, initiated by UNESCO; international festival of visual art Wiz-Art; international theatrical festival Golden Lion; Lviv Lumines Fluorescent Art Festival; Festival of Contemporary Dramaturgy; international contemporary music festival Contrasts; Lviv international literary festival, Krayina Mriy; gastronomic festival Lviv on a Plate; organ music festival Diapason; international independent film festival KinoLev; international festival LvivKlezFest; and international media festival MediaDepo.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

[[File:Electron 1179 (2).jpg|thumb|A [[Trams in Lviv|Lviv tram]] in the Old Town]]
Historically, the first [[horse-drawn tram]]way lines in Lviv were inaugurated on 5 May 1880. An electric tram was introduced on 31 May 1894. The last horse-drawn line was transferred to electric traction in 1908. In 1922 the tramways were switched to driving on the right-hand side. After the annexation of the city by the Soviet Union, several lines were closed but most of the infrastructure was preserved. The tracks are [[narrow gauge railway|narrow-gauge]], unusual for the Soviet Union, but explained by the fact that the system was built while the city was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and needed to run in narrow medieval streets in the centre of town.

The [[Trams in Lviv|Lviv tramway system]] now runs about 220 cars on {{cvt|75|km|0|abbr=off}} of track. Many tracks were reconstructed around 2006. The price in February 2019 of a tram/trolleybus ticket was 5 UAH (the reduced fare ticket was 2.5 UAH, e.g. for students). The ticket may be purchased from the driver.

After World War II the city grew rapidly due to evacuees returning from Russia, and the Soviet Government's vigorous development of [[heavy industry]]. This included the transfer of entire factories from the Urals and others to the newly "liberated" territories of the USSR. The city centre tramway lines were replaced with [[Lviv trolleybus|trolleybuses]] on 27 November 1952. New lines were opened to the [[Tower block|blocks of flats]] at the city outskirts.

The network now runs about 100 trolleybuses – mostly of the 1980s Skoda 14Tr and [[:uk:ЛАЗ 52522|LAZ 52522]]. From 2006 to 2008 11 modern [[Low floor|low-floor]] trolleybuses (LAZ E183) built by the [[Lviv Bus Factory]] were purchased. The public [[bus network]] is represented by mini-buses (so-called ''marshrutka'') and large buses mainly LAZ and MAN. On 1 January 2013, the city had 52 public bus routes. The price is 7.00 UAH regardless of the distance travelled. The ticket may be purchased from the driver.

===Railways===
{{Main|Lviv Railways}}
[[File:Lviv railway station2.png|thumb|Lviv's [[Lviv Rail Terminal|Main Railway Terminal]]]]
Modern Lviv remains a hub on which nine railways converge providing local and international services. Lviv railway is one of the oldest in Ukraine. The first train arrived in Lviv on 4 November 1861. The main [[Lviv Rail Terminal|Lviv Railway Station]], designed by [[Władysław Sadłowski]], was built in 1904 and was considered one of the best in Europe from both the architectural and technical aspects.

In the inter-war period, Lviv (known then as Lwów) was one of the most important hubs of the [[Polish State Railways]]. The Lwów junction consisted of four stations in mid-1939 – main station ''Lwów Główny'' (now {{langx|uk|Lviv Holovnyi}}), Lwów Kleparów (now ''Lviv Klepariv''), ''Lwów Łyczaków'' (now ''Lviv Lychakiv''), and ''Lwów Podzamcze'' (now ''Lviv Pidzamche''). In August 1939 just before World War II, 73 trains departed daily from the Main Station including 56 local and 17 fast trains. Lwów was directly connected with all major centres of the Second Polish Republic as well as such cities as Berlin, [[Bucharest]], and [[Budapest]].<ref>Urzędowy Rozkład Jazdy i Lotów PKP, Lato 1939 (Polish State Railroads Timetable, Summer 1939)</ref>

Currently, several trains cross the nearby [[Poland–Ukraine border|Polish–Ukrainian border]] (mostly via [[Przemyśl]] in Poland). There are good connections to Slovakia ([[Košice]]) and Hungary ([[Budapest]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Many routes have overnight trains with sleeping compartments. Lviv railway is often called the main gateway from Ukraine to Europe although buses are often a cheaper and more convenient way of entering the "[[Schengen Area|Schengen]]" countries.

Lviv used to have a [[Railbus]], which has since been replaced with other means of public transport. It was a motor-rail car that ran from the largest district of Lviv to one of the largest industrial zones going through the central railway station. It made seven trips a day and was meant to provide a faster and more comfortable connection between the remote urban districts. The price in February 2010 of a one-way single ride in the railbus was 1.50 UAH. On 15 June 2010, the route was cancelled as unprofitable.

===Air transport===
[[File:Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 767-300ER (ET-AMG) at Lviv International Airport.jpeg|thumb|[[Lviv International Airport]]]]
The beginnings of aviation in Lviv reach back to 1884 when the Aeronautic Society was opened there. The society issued its own magazine ''Astronauta'' but soon ceased to exist. In 1909 on the initiative of Edmund Libanski the Awiata Society was founded. Among its members there was a group of professors and students of the [[Lviv Polytechnic]], including [[Stefan Drzewiecki]] and Zygmunt Sochacki. Awiata was the oldest Polish organization of this kind and it concentrated its activities mainly on exhibitions such as the ''First Aviation Exhibition'' which took place in 1910 and featured models of aircraft built by Lviv students.<ref name="Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow">{{cite web |url=http://www.lwow.home.pl/semper/lotniczy.html |title=Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow |publisher=Lwow.home.pl |access-date=3 May 2012 |archive-date=5 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305172622/http://www.lwow.home.pl/semper/lotniczy.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1913–1914 brothers Tadeusz and Władysław Floriańscy built a two-seater aeroplane. When World War I broke out Austrian authorities confiscated it but did not manage to evacuate the plane in time and it was seized by the Russians who used the plane for intelligence purposes. The Floriański brothers' plane was the first Polish-made aircraft. On 5 November 1918, a crew consisting of [[Stefan Bastyr]] and Janusz de Beaurain carried out the first-ever flight under the [[Flag of Poland|Polish flag]] taking off from Lviv's Lewandówka (now {{langx|uk|Levandivka}}) airport.<ref name="Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow" /> In the interbellum period Lwów was a major centre of gliding with a notable ''Gliding School'' in Bezmiechowa which opened in 1932. In the same year the Institute of Gliding Technology was opened in Lwów and was the second such institute in the world. In 1938 the ''First Polish Aircraft Exhibition'' took place in the city.

The interwar Lwów was also a major centre of the [[Polish Air Force]] with the Sixth Air Regiment located there. The Regiment was based at the Lwów airport opened in 1924 in the suburb of Skniłów (today {{langx|uk|Sknyliv}}). The airport is located {{cvt|6|km|0|abbr=off}} from the city centre.<ref name=europe-airports>{{cite web |url=http://www.europe-airports.com/ukraine/show-airport.php?code=LWO |title=Europe Airports – Lviv (LWO) |publisher=Europe-airports.com |access-date=3 May 2012 |archive-date=4 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304130608/http://www.europe-airports.com/ukraine/show-airport.php?code=LWO |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2012, after renovation, Lviv Airport got a new official name [[Lviv Danylo Halytskyi International Airport]] (LWO).<ref name="New terminal of the Lviv Airport">{{cite web |url=http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/en/publish/article?art_id=245126146&cat_id=244314975 |title=New terminal of the Lviv Airport |publisher=kmu.gov.ua |access-date=19 February 2013 |archive-date=22 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522135150/http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/en/publish/article?art_id=245126146&cat_id=244314975 |url-status=live }}</ref> A new terminal and other improvements worth under a $200 million has been done in preparation for the 2012 UEFA European Football Championship.<ref>[http://zik.com.ua/en/news/2008/05/27/137795 Modernization of Lviv airport for Euro-2012 finals to cost $200 million.

===Bicycle lanes===
[[File:LvivPolice2019.jpg|thumb|Police patrol by bicycles in the tourist area of Lviv]]
Cycling is a new but growing mode of transport in Lviv. In 2011 the City of Lviv ratified an ambitious 9-year program for the set-up of [[cycling infrastructure]]<ref>[http://www.city-adm.lviv.ua/news/images/stories/program_bicycle_network_lviv.pdf Lviv City Administration – Bicycle Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717123621/http://www.city-adm.lviv.ua/news/images/stories/program_bicycle_network_lviv.pdf|date=17 July 2011 }}</ref> – until the year 2019 an overall length of {{cvt|270|km|0}} cycle lanes and tracks shall be realized. A working group formally organised within the City Council, bringing together representatives of the city administration, members of planning and design institutes, local NGOs and other stakeholders. Events like the All-Ukrainian Bikeday<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bikeday.org.ua |title=bikeday.org.ua |publisher=bikeday.org.ua |access-date=16 February 2013 |archive-date=2 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302160044/http://www.bikeday.org.ua/ |url-status=live }}</ref> or the [[European Mobility Week]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mobilnist.org.ua/en/downloads/doc_download/43-european-mobility-week-2011-in-lvivukraine.html |title=Downloads &#124; Event Reports |publisher=Mobilnist.org.ua |access-date=16 February 2013 |archive-date=17 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317020347/http://www.mobilnist.org.ua/en/downloads/doc_download/43-european-mobility-week-2011-in-lvivukraine.html |url-status=live }}</ref> show the popularity of cycling among Lviv's citizens.

By September 2011, {{cvt|8|km|0}} of new cycling infrastructure had been built. It can be expected that until the end of 2011 {{cvt|50|km|0}} will be ready for use. The cycling advisor in Lviv – the first such position in Ukraine – is supervising and pushing forward the execution of the cycling plan and coordinates with various people in the city. The development of cycling in Ukraine is currently hampered by outdated planning norms and the fact, that most planners didn't yet plan and experience cycling infrastructure. The update of national legislation and training for planners is therefore necessary.

In 2015, the first stations have been set up for a new [[bike-sharing]] system [[Nextbike]] – the first of its kind in Ukraine. New bike lanes are also under construction, making Lviv the most bike-friendly city in the country. The City Council plans to build an entire cycling infrastructure by 2020, with cycle lanes ({{cvt|268|km|mi|abbr=off|disp=or}}) and street bike hire services.
