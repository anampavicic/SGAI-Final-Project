The earliest evidence of settlement in Amman dates to the 8th millennium BC in [[Ayn Ghazal (archaeological site)|'Ain Ghazal]], home to the world's [[ʿAin Ghazal statues|oldest statues of the human form]]. The city was known as ''Rabat Aman'' during the 2nd millennium BC, serving as the capital of the [[Ammon|Ammonite Kingdom]] that was centered at the [[Amman Citadel]]. In the 3rd century BC, the city was renamed ''Philadelphia'' and became one of the ten Greco-Roman cities of the [[Decapolis]]. Later, in the 7th century AD, the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] renamed the city Amman. Throughout most of the Islamic era, the city alternated between periods of devastation and abandonment and periods of relative prosperity. Amman was largely abandoned from the 15th century until 1878, when the [[Ottoman Empire]] authorities began settling [[Circassians]] there, witnessing growth after [[Hejaz railway|1904]], leading to the establishment of its first municipal council in 1909.<ref name=Ref12/> 

The city witnessed rapid growth after its designation as [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]]'s capital in 1921, receiving migrations from different Jordanian and Levantine cities, and later several successive waves of refugees: [[Palestinians]] in 1948 and 1967; Iraqis in 1990 and 2003; and Syrians since 2011. It was initially built on [[List of cities claimed to be built on seven hills|seven hills]], but now spans over 19 hills combining 22 areas,<ref name=Ref12>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&pg=PA35| title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia| isbn=978-1-57607-919-5| page=35| year=2007| author1=Michael Dumper| author2=Bruce E.

==Etymology==
Amman derives its name from the ancient people of the [[Ammon]]ites, whose capital the city had been since the 13th century BC. The Ammonites named it ''Rabat ʿAmmān'' (𐤓𐤁𐤕 𐤏𐤌𐤍),<ref name="Lipiński"/> with the term ''Rabat'' meaning the "Capital" or the "King's Quarters". In the [[Hebrew Bible]], the town is referred to as {{Lang|hbo-latn|Rabbaṯ Bənē ʿAmmōn}} ({{Lang|hbo|רַבַּת בְּנֵי עַמּוֹן}}) or simply {{Lang|hbo-latn|Rabbā}} ({{Lang|hbo|רַבָּה}}),<ref>{{cite web |title=BDB, רַבָּה 1 |url=https://www.sefaria.org/BDB%2C_%D7%A8%D6%B7%D7%91%D6%B8%D6%BC%D7%94.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en |website=www.sefaria.org}}</ref> and it appears in English translations as "Rabbath Ammon". [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], the Macedonian ruler of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] who reigned from 283 to 246 BC, renamed the city "Philadelphia" ({{langx|grc|Φιλαδέλφεια}}; literally: "[[Philia|brotherly love]]"), after himself, after occupying it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mansaf.org/catholic/misdar.htm|access-date=22 September 2015|title=MISDAR|work=mansaf.org|archive-date=23 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923060813/http://www.mansaf.org/catholic/misdar.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> By the Islamic era, the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] restored its ancient semitic name and called it Amman in the 7th century AD.<ref name=about>{{cite web| url=http://www.ammancity.gov.jo/en/gam/about.asp| title=About GAM => History| work=Greater Amman Municipality| access-date=22 September 2015| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002102003/http://ammancity.gov.jo/en/gam/about.asp| archive-date=2 October 2015}}</ref>

The [[Neolithic]] site of [[Ayn Ghazal (archaeological site)|ʿAin Ghazal]] today lies in the outskirts of Amman. At its height, around 7000 BC (9000 years ago), it had an area of {{convert|15|ha|abbr=off|sp=us}} and was inhabited by ca. 3000 people (four to five times the population of contemporary [[Tell es-Sultan|Jericho]]). At that time, the site was a typical [[aceramic]] [[Neolithic]] village. Its houses were rectangular mud-bricked buildings that included a main square living room, whose walls were made up of lime plaster.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prehistoric Settlements of the Middle East|url=http://docslide.us/documents/prehistoric-settlements-of-the-middle-east.html|access-date=22 September 2015|work=bhavika1990|date=8 November 2014|archive-date=25 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925132728/http://docslide.us/documents/prehistoric-settlements-of-the-middle-east.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The site was discovered in 1974 as construction workers were working on a road crossing the area. By 1982, when the excavations started, around {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} of road ran through the site. Despite the damage brought by urban expansion, the remains of ʿAin Ghazal provided a wealth of information.<ref name=gard/>

ʿAin Ghazal is well known for a set of small human statues found in 1983, when local archeologists stumbled upon the edge of a large pit containing them.<ref>{{cite book| editor1-first = Chris | editor1-last = Scarre | title = The Human Past | publisher = Thames & Hudson | year = 2005 | page = 222}}</ref> These statues are human figures made with white plaster, with painted eyes.

===Iron Age: the Ammonites===

In the 13th century BC, Amman was the capital of the [[Ammon|Ammonite Kingdom]], and became known as "Rabat Amman". Rabat Amman provided several natural resources to the region, including sandstone and limestone, along with a productive agricultural sector that made it a vital location along the [[King's Highway (ancient)|King's Highway]], the ancient trade route connecting [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] with [[Mesopotamia]], [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and [[Anatolia]]. As with the [[Edomites]] and [[Moabites]], trade along this route gave the Ammonites considerable revenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_testament.html|access-date=10 October 2015|title=The Old Testament Kingdoms of Jordan|work=kinghussein.gov.jo|archive-date=6 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506015442/http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_testament.html|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Milcom]] is named in the [[Hebrew Bible]] as the [[national god]] of Rabat Amman. Another ancient [[deity]], [[Moloch]], usually associated with the use of children as offerings, is also mentioned in the Bible as a god of the Ammonites, but this is probably a mistake for Milcom. However, excavations by archeologists near [[Amman Civil Airport]] uncovered a temple, which included an altar containing many human bone fragments. The bones showed evidence of burning, which led to the assumption that the altar functioned as a [[pyre]] and used for [[human sacrifice]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.biblestudywithrandy.com/2014/08/temple-human-sacrifice-amman-jordan| access-date=22 September 2015| title=Temple of Human Sacrifice: Amman Jordan| work=Randy McCracken| date=22 August 2014| archive-date=1 October 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001143535/http://www.biblestudywithrandy.com/2014/08/temple-human-sacrifice-amman-jordan/| url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/ancient-cultures/daily-life-and-practice/first-person-human-sacrifice-to-an-ammonite-god/| title=First Person: Human Sacrifice to an Ammonite God?| work=Hershel Shanks| publisher=Biblical Archaeology Review| date=September–October 2014| access-date=24 November 2022| archive-date=24 November 2022| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221124042928/https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/ancient-cultures/daily-life-and-practice/first-person-human-sacrifice-to-an-ammonite-god/| url-status=live}}</ref>

Amman is mentioned several times in the Hebrew Bible. According to the biblical narrative, the Ammonite king [[Hanun]] allied with [[Hadadezer ben Rehob|Hadadezer]], king of [[Zobah|Aram-Zobah]], against the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Kingdom of Israel]]. During the war, [[Joab]], the captain of King [[David]]'s army, laid siege to Rabbah, Hanun's royal capital, and destroyed it ({{Bibleverse|2 Samuel|12:26-28|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse|1 Chronicles|20:1-2|KJV}}). David took a great quantity of plunder from the city, including the king's crown, and brought it to his capital, [[Jerusalem]] ({{Bibleverse|2 Samuel|12:29-31|KJV}}). Hanun's brother, [[Shobi]], was made king in his place, and became a loyal vassal of David ({{Bibleverse|2 Samuel|17:27|KJV}}). Hundreds of years later, the prophet [[Jeremiah]] foresaw the coming destruction and final desolation of the city ({{Bibleverse|Jeremiah|49:2|KJV}}).<ref>Horn, S. H. (1973).

Several Ammonite ruins across Amman exist, such as [[Rujm Al-Malfouf]] and some parts of the [[Amman Citadel]].

One of the most original monuments in Jordan, and perhaps in the [[Hellenistic period]] in the Near East, is the village of [[Iraq al-Amir]] in the valley of [[Wadi Al-Seer]], southwest of Amman, which is home to [[Qasr al-Abd]] ('Castle of the Slave').

The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] conquered much of the [[Levant]] in 63 BC, inaugurating a period of Roman rule that lasted for four centuries. In the northern modern-day Jordan, the Greek cities of Philadelphia (Amman), [[Jerash|Gerasa]], [[Umm Qays|Gedara]], [[Pella]] and [[Irbid|Arbila]] joined with other cities in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Syria]]; [[Beit She'an|Scythopolis]], [[Hippos, Israel|Hippos]], [[Capitolias]], [[Qanawat|Canatha]] and [[Damascus]] to form the [[Decapolis|Decapolis League]], a confederation linked by bonds of economic and cultural interest.<ref name=DOA/> Philadelphia became a point along a road stretching from [[Aqaba|Ailah]] to Damascus that was built by Emperor [[Trajan]] in AD 106.

Roman rule in Jordan left several ruins across the country, some of which exist in Amman, such as the [[Temple of Hercules (Amman)|Temple of Hercules]] at the [[Amman Citadel]], the [[Roman theater (Amman)|Roman Theatre]], the [[Odeon theater (Amman)|Odeon]], and the [[Nymphaeum (Amman)|Nymphaeum]]. The two theaters and the [[nymphaeum]] fountain were built during the reign of Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] around AD 161. The theatre was the larger venue of the two and had a capacity for 6,000 attendees. It was oriented north and built into the hillside, to protect the audience from the sun. To the northeast of the theatre was a small [[Odeon (building)|odeon]]. Built at roughly the same time as the theatre, the Odeon had 500 seats and is still in use today for music concerts. Archaeologists speculate that the structure was originally covered with a wooden roof to shield the audience from the weather. The Nymphaeum is situated southwest of the Odeon and served as Philadelphia's chief fountain. The Nymphaeum is believed to have contained a {{convert|600|m2|sp=us}} pool which was {{convert|3|m|sp=us}} deep and was continuously refilled with water.<ref name=KH/> During the late [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period in the seventh century, several bishops and churches were based in the city.<ref name=KH/>

In the 630s, the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] conquered the region from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], beginning the Islamic era in the Levant. Philadelphia was renamed "Amman" by the Muslims and became part of the district of [[Jund Dimashq]]. A large part of the population already spoke [[Arabic]], which facilitated integration into the [[caliphate]], as well as several conversions to [[Islam]]. Under the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliphs who began their rule in 661 AD, numerous [[desert castle]]s were established as a means to govern the desert area of modern-day Jordan, several of which are still well-preserved. Amman had already been functioning as an administrative centre. The Umayyads built a large palace on the [[Amman Citadel]] hill, known today as the [[Umayyad Palace]]. Amman was later destroyed by several earthquakes and natural disasters, including a particularly severe earthquake in 747. The Umayyads were [[Abbasid Revolution|overthrown]] by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] three years later.<ref name=DOA/>

Amman's importance declined by the mid-8th century after damage caused by several earthquakes rendered it uninhabitable.<ref name=Ifpo>{{cite book |chapter=The Exclusion of Amman from Jordanian National Identity |title=Cities, Urban Practices and Nation Building in Jordan |series=Cahiers de l'Ifpo Nr. 6 |author=Ali Kassay |editor=Myriam Ababsa |editor2=Rami Farouk Daher |year=2011 |location=Beirut |publisher=Presses de l'Ifpo |pages=256–271 |isbn=9782351591826 |url=http://books.openedition.org/ifpo/1748?lang=en |access-date=25 December 2015 |archive-date=26 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226111837/http://books.openedition.org/ifpo/1748?lang=en |url-status=live }}</ref> Excavations among the collapsed layer of the Umayyad Palace have revealed remains of [[kiln]]s from the time of the Abbasids (750–969) and the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] (969–1099).<ref name=Arce>{{cite journal |title=Early Islamic lime kilns from the Near East.

Its function as the capital of the country attracted immigrants from different Levantine areas, particularly from al-Salt, a nearby city that had been the largest urban settlement east of the [[Jordan River]] at the time. The early settlers who came from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] were overwhelmingly from [[Nablus]], from which many of al-Salt's inhabitants had originated.

In 1970, Amman was a [[Battle of Amman (1970)|battlefield]] during the conflict between the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) and the [[Royal Jordanian Army|Jordanian Army]] known as [[Black September in Jordan|Black September]]. The Jordanian Army defeated the PLO in 1971, and the latter were expelled to [[Lebanon]].<ref name=JWT>{{cite web| url=http://www.jordanwildernesstours.com/amman.htm| title=Amman| access-date=22 September 2015| work=Jordan Wild Tours| archive-date=26 October 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181026025059/http://www.jordanwildernesstours.com/amman.htm| url-status=live}}</ref> The first wave of Iraqi refugees settled in the city after the 1991 [[Gulf War]], with a second wave occurring in the aftermath of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

During the 2010s, the city has experienced an economic, cultural and urban boom. The large growth in population has significantly increased the need for new accommodation, and new districts of the city were established at a quick pace. This strained Jordan's scarce water supply and exposed Amman to the dangers of quick expansion without careful municipal planning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nordregio.org/amman-one-of-the-fastest-grown-cities-in-the-world-is-moving-towards-sustainable-city-planning/|title=Amman, one of the fastest grown cities in the world, is moving towards sustainable city planning|date=17 January 2019|accessdate=7 January 2023|work=Nordregio|archive-date=16 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191116014216/https://www.nordregio.org/amman-one-of-the-fastest-grown-cities-in-the-world-is-moving-towards-sustainable-city-planning/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
Amman features a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: Csa) in its western and northern neighborhoods, while its eastern and southern neighborhoods experience a [[semi-arid climate]] (Köppen: BSh/BSk).

The [[summer]] season in Amman is moderately long, characterized by mild heat and refreshing breezes. However, occasional heatwaves may occur during this period. [[Spring (season)|Spring]] is brief yet warm, with temperatures reaching highs of 28&nbsp;°C (82&nbsp;°F). This season typically commences between April and May, lasting for about a month. [[Winter]] usually sets in around the end of November, extending through early to mid-March. During winter, temperatures typically hover around or below 17&nbsp;°C (63&nbsp;°F), with sporadic [[snow]]fall occurring once or twice a year.

The average annual rainfall in Amman is around 385&nbsp;mm (15&nbsp;in), with great variations between different parts of the city. The western areas receive more than 500&nbsp;mm (20&nbsp;in) of rainfall, whereas the eastern areas receive less than 250&nbsp;mm (10&nbsp;in). Rainfall primarily occurs between November and April, and periodic droughts are not uncommon.

Amman experiences heavy [[fog]] on about 120 days each year. The city's diverse weather conditions are heavily influenced by differences in [[elevation]]. While snow might accumulate in the higher-altitude western and northern regions of Amman (with an average altitude of 1,000 m or 3,300&nbsp;ft above sea level), the city center (at an elevation of 700 m or 2,300&nbsp;ft) might experience rainfall simultaneously. This variation in elevation leads to extreme [[microclimate]]s within Amman, with each district having its own distinct weather patterns.

Amman is governed by a 41-member city council elected in four-year term direct elections. All Jordanian citizens above 18 years old are eligible to vote in the municipal elections. However, the mayor is appointed by the king and not through elections.<ref name=about/> In 1909 a city council was established in Amman by Circassian [[Ismael Babouk]] who became the first-ever mayor of the capital, and in 1914 Amman's first city district center was founded.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ammancity.gov.jo/ar/gam/council.asp| title=GAM council| access-date=23 September 2015| publisher=Greater Amman Municipality| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002043553/http://ammancity.gov.jo/ar/gam/council.asp| archive-date=2 October 2015}}</ref>

The Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) has been investing in making the city a better place, through a number of initiatives. Green Amman 2020 was initiated in 2014, aiming to turn the city to a [[environmentally friendly|green metropolis]] by 2020.

==Economy==
===Banking sector===
The [[bank]]ing sector is one of the principal foundations of Jordan's economy. Despite the unrest and economic difficulties in the Arab world resulting from the [[Arab Spring]] uprisings, Jordan's banking sector maintained its growth in 2014. The sector consists of 25 banks, 15 of which are listed on the [[Amman Stock Exchange]]. Amman is the base city for the international [[Arab Bank]], one of the largest financial institutions in the Middle East, serving clients in more than 600 branches in 30 countries on five continents. Arab Bank represents 28% of the Amman Stock Exchange and is the highest-ranked institution by [[market capitalization]] on the exchange.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.awraq.com/uploads/research/b7e73be8b70e8bd319cbf637c046d178e431ccdb.pdf| title=Jordan Banking Sector Brief| access-date=23 September 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305065843/http://www.awraq.com/uploads/research/b7e73be8b70e8bd319cbf637c046d178e431ccdb.pdf| archive-date=5 March 2016| url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Tourism===

Amman is the 4th most visited Arab city and the ninth highest recipient of international visitor spending. Roughly 1.8&nbsp;million tourists visited Amman in 2011 and spent over $1.3&nbsp;billion in the city.<ref>{{cite web | author=MasterCard Worldwide | url=http://www.slideshare.net/MasterCardNews/global-destination-cities-index-slideshare-final | title=MasterCard Worldwide's Global Destination Cities Index | publisher=Slideshare.net | access-date=28 November 2012 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718210425/http://www.slideshare.net/MasterCardNews/global-destination-cities-index-slideshare-final | archive-date=18 July 2012 }}</ref> The expansion of [[Queen Alia International Airport]] is an example of the Greater Amman Municipality's heavy investment in the city's infrastructure.

===Business===
Amman is introducing itself as a business hub. The city's skyline is being continuously transformed through the emergence of new projects. A significant portion of business flowed into Amman following the 2003 [[Iraq War]]. Jordan's main airport, [[Queen Alia International Airport]], is located south of Amman and is the hub for the country's national carrier [[Royal Jordanian]], a major airline in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2010/august/i_bca01.pdf|title=Royal Jordanian was the first airline in the Middle East to order the 787 Dreamliner|publisher=Boeing|access-date=30 September 2015|archive-date=4 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063036/http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2010/august/i_bca01.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> The airline is headquartered in [[Zahran district]].

From a population of roughly 1,000 in 1890, Amman grew to around 1,000,000 inhabitants in 1990, primarily as a result of immigration, but also due to the high birthrate in the city.<ref name=DS34>Dumper and Stanley, p. 34.</ref> Amman had been abandoned for centuries until hundreds of [[Circassians]] settled it in the 19th century. Today, about 40,000 Circassians live in Amman and its vicinity.<ref>Albala, p. 267.</ref> After Amman became a major hub along the [[Hejaz Railway]] in 1914, many Muslim and Christian merchant families from al-Salt immigrated to the city.<ref>Richmond, p. 124.</ref> A large proportion of Amman's inhabitants have [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] roots (urban or rural origin), and the two main demographic groups in the city today are Arabs of Palestinian or Jordanian descent. Other ethnic groups comprise about 2% of the population. There are no official statistics about the proportion of people of Palestinian or Jordanian descent.<ref>Dakwar, pp. 31–32.</ref>

New arrivals consisting of Jordanians from the north and south of the country and immigrants from Palestine had increased the city's population from 30,000 in 1930 to 60,000 in 1947.<ref name=Suleiman101>Suleiman, p. 101.</ref> About 10,000 Palestinians, mostly from [[Safed]], [[Haifa]] and [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], migrated to the city for economic opportunities before the [[1948 Palestine war|1948 war]].<ref name=Plascov33/> Many of the immigrants from al-Salt from that time were originally from [[Nablus]].<ref>Dakwar, p. 31.</ref> The 1948 war caused an exodus of urban Muslim and Christian Palestinian refugees, mostly from [[Jaffa]], [[Ramla]] and [[Lod|Lydda]], to Amman,<ref name=Plascov33>Plascov, p. 33.</ref> whose population swelled to 110,000.<ref name=Suleiman101/> With Jordan's capture of the [[West Bank]] during the war, many Palestinians from that area steadily migrated to Amman between 1950 and 1966, before another mass wave of Palestinian refugees from the West Bank moved to the city during the [[Six-Day War|1967 War]]. By 1970, the population had swelled to an estimated 550,000.<ref name=Suleiman101/> A further 200,000 Palestinians arrived after their expulsion from Kuwait during the 1991 [[Gulf War]]. Several large [[Palestinian refugee camp]]s exist around the center of Amman.<ref name=DS35>Dumper and Stanley, p. 35.</ref>

Because Amman lacks a deep-rooted native population, the city does not have a distinct Arabic [[dialect]], although recently such a dialect utilizing the various Jordanian and Palestinian dialects, has been forming.<ref>Owens, p. 260.</ref> The children of immigrants in the city are also increasingly referring to themselves as "Ammani", unlike much of the first-generation inhabitants who identify more with their respective places of origin.<ref>Jones, p. 64.</ref>

===Religion===
Amman has a mostly [[Sunni Muslim]] population, and the city contains numerous [[mosque]]s.<ref>Ring, Salkin and LaBoda, p. 65.</ref> Among the main mosques is the large [[King Abdullah I Mosque]], built between 1982 and 1989. It is capped by a blue mosaic [[dome]] beneath which 3,000 Muslims may offer prayer. The Abu Darweesh Mosque, noted for its checkered black-and-white pattern, has an architectural style that is unique to Jordan.<ref name=JTravel>{{cite web |title= Amman – a modern city built on the sands of time |publisher= jordantoursandtravel.com |work= Jordan Travel |url= http://www.jordantoursandtravel.com/amman.html |access-date= 22 September 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030150/http://www.jordantoursandtravel.com/amman.html |archive-date= 4 March 2016 |url-status= dead}}</ref> The mosque is situated on [[Ashrafiyah, Amman|Jabal Ashrafieh]], the highest point in the city.

[[Downtown Amman]], the city center area (known in Arabic as ''Al-Balad''), has been dwarfed by the sprawling urban area that surrounds it. Despite the changes, much remains of its old character. [[Jabal Amman]] is a tourist attraction in old Amman, where the city's largest souks, museums, ancient constructions, monuments, and cultural sites are found. Jabal Amman also contains the famous [[Rainbow Street]] and the cultural [[Souk Jara]] market.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Newly Stylish Amman Asserts Itself |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/travel/22next.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=20 January 2023 |last=Ferren |first=Andrew |archive-date=7 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221007023427/https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/travel/22next.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Transportation==
===Airports===
[[File:Queen Alia International Airport Terminal.jpg|thumb|right|Queen Alia International Airport]]

The main airport serving Amman is [[Queen Alia International Airport]], situated about {{convert|30|km|2|abbr=on}} south of Amman. Much smaller is [[Amman Civil Airport]], a one-terminal airport that serves primarily domestic and nearby international routes and the army. Queen Alia International Airport is the major [[international airport]] in Jordan and the [[airline hub|hub]] for [[Royal Jordanian]], the [[flag carrier]]. Its expansion was recently done and modified, including the decommissioning of the old terminals and the commissioning of new terminals costing $700M, to handle over 16&nbsp;million passengers annually.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.albawaba.com/accelerating-passenger-growth-jordan%E2%80%99s-qaia-suggests-confidence-returning-386395 |title=Accelerating passenger growth at Jordan's QAIA suggests confidence returning |website=Al Bawaba |date=1 August 2011 |access-date=28 November 2012 |archive-date=2 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402232923/http://www.albawaba.com/accelerating-passenger-growth-jordan%E2%80%99s-qaia-suggests-confidence-returning-386395 |url-status=live }}</ref> It is now considered a state-of-the-art airport and was named 'the best airport in the [[Middle East]]' for 2014 and 2015 and 'the best improvement in the Middle East' for 2014 by [[List of Airport Service Quality Award winners|Airport Service Quality]] Survey, the world's leading airport passenger satisfaction benchmark program.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.aig.aero/en/content/1st-place-service-quality-rankings-qaia-named-best-airport-region-middle-east-and-best| access-date=23 September 2015| title=1st Place Service Quality Rankings: QAIA Named 'Best Airport by Region – Middle East' and 'Best Improvement by Region – Middle East'| date=23 February 2015| archive-date=25 September 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925072005/http://www.aig.aero/en/content/1st-place-service-quality-rankings-qaia-named-best-airport-region-middle-east-and-best| url-status=live}}</ref>

===Roads===
{{see also|List of roads in Amman}}

Amman has an extensive road network. Eight [[roundabout]] "circles", which formerly marked neighborhoods, are used as landmarks.<ref name="KH"/> The road network includes many bridges and tunnels due to the mountainous nature of the terrain. A leading example is the [[Abdoun Bridge]], which spans [[Wadi Abdoun]] and connects the [[List of roads in Amman#Circles|4th Circle]] to [[Abdoun Circle]]. It is considered one of Amman's many landmarks and is the first curved suspended bridge to be built in the country.<ref name="KH"/>
[[File:Abdoun Bridge - Amman.jpg|thumb|right|Abdoun Bridge, considered one of Amman's landmarks]]

Successive waves of refugees to the city has led to the rapid construction of new neighborhoods, but Amman's capacity for new or widened roads remains limited despite the influx. This has resulted in increasing traffic jams, particularly during summer when there are large numbers of tourists and Jordanian expatriates visiting.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/amman-residents-complain-about-daylong-car-jams| title=Amman residents complain about daylong car jams| access-date=23 September 2015| date=8 June 2014| work=[[The Jordan Times]]| archive-date=25 September 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925114322/http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/amman-residents-complain-about-daylong-car-jams| url-status=live}}</ref> In 2015, a [[ring road]] encompassing the city was constructed, which aims to connect the northern and southern parts of the city in order for traffic to be diverted outside Amman and to improve the environmental conditions in the city.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/pm-inaugurates-second-phase-amman-road-project| title=PM inaugurates second phase of Amman road project| access-date=23 September 2015| date=5 February 2012| work=The Jordan Times| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925104750/http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/pm-inaugurates-second-phase-amman-road-project| archive-date=25 September 2015}}</ref>
[[File:BRT in Amman, Jordan 3.jpg|thumb|right|175px|BRT bus at a stop along its route]]

===Bus and taxi===

The city has frequent bus connections to other cities in Jordan, as well as to major cities in neighboring countries; the latter are also served by service taxis. Internal transport is served by a number of bus routes and taxis. Service taxis, which most often operate on fixed routes, are readily available and inexpensive. The two main bus and taxi stations are Abdali (near the [[King Abdullah I Mosque|King Abdullah Mosque]], the [[Parliament of Jordan|Parliament]] and Palace of Justice) and the Raghadan Central Bus Station near the Roman theater in the city center. Popular Jordanian bus company services include JETT and Al-Mahatta. Taxis are the most common way to get around in Amman due their high availability and inexpensiveness.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://studiesabroad.com/programs/country/jordan/city/amman/cultureCorner/transportation | title=Transportation in Amman | access-date=2 September 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925105718/http://studiesabroad.com/programs/country/jordan/city/amman/cultureCorner/transportation | archive-date=25 September 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

The [[Amman Bus]] and the [[Amman Bus Rapid Transit]] public transportation systems currently serve the city. Construction work on the BRT system started in 2010, but was halted soon after amid feasibility concerns. Resuming in 2015, the first route of the BRT system was inaugurated in 2021, and the second in 2022. Another BRT route [[Amman-Zarqa Bus Rapid Transit|connecting Amman with Zarqa]] started operations in May 2024.<ref name=BRT>{{cite web|url=https://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/brt-offers-new-commuting-experience-trial-run-continues|title=BRT offers new commuting experience as trial run continues|accessdate=8 February 2022|date=29 July 2021|work=the Jordan Times|archive-date=8 February 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220208010439/https://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/brt-offers-new-commuting-experience-trial-run-continues|url-status=live}}</ref>

The BRT system in Amman runs on 2 routes: the first from [[Sweileh]] in northwest Amman to the Ras Al-Ain area next to [[downtown Amman]], and the second from Sweileh to Mahatta terminal in eastern Amman. Both routes meet at the Sports City intersection. The first route is currently served by three lines: 98, 99 and 100.<ref name=BRT/> Ticket price for all lines of Amman Bus and Amman BRT are bought either online via the Amman Bus mobile application or as a rechargeable card in major terminals. Passengers scan their cards or QR codes on phone when boarding the bus, where the price ticket is subtracted from the available balance. The buses are air-conditioned, accessible, monitored with security cameras and have free internet service.<ref name=BRT/>
