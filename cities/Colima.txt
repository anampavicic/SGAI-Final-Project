'''Colima''' ({{IPA|es|koˈlima|-|ES-pe - Colima.ogg}}), officially the '''Free and Sovereign State of Colima''' ({{langx|es|link=no|Estado Libre y Soberano de Colima}}), is among the 31 states that make up the [[Political divisions of Mexico|32 Federal Entities]] of [[Mexico]]. It shares its name with its capital and main city, [[Colima City|Colima]].

Colima is a small state of western Mexico on the central Pacific coast, and includes the four oceanic [[Revillagigedo Islands]]. Mainland Colima shares borders with the states of [[Jalisco]] and [[Michoacán]]. In addition to the capital city of Colima, the main cities are [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]], Villa de Alvarez and [[Tecomán]]. Colima is the fourth smallest state in Mexico and has the smallest population, but has one of Mexico's highest standards of living and the lowest unemployment. It is also the state with the highest murder rate per capita and one of the highest crime rates, due to its ports being a contested area for cartels.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Goodwin |first=Zachary |date=June 24, 2020 |title=Why One of Mexico's Smallest States Is Also Its Most Violent |url=https://insightcrime.org/news/analysis/colima-mexico-homicides-cartels/ |access-date=September 23, 2022 |website=InSight Crime |language=en-US |archive-date=September 23, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220923125201/https://insightcrime.org/news/analysis/colima-mexico-homicides-cartels/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Geography==

[[File:Colima Volcanoes from Carrizalillos Lagoon.jpg|thumb|left|View of the volcanoes from Carrizalillos Lake]]
[[File:Playa La Audiencia.JPG|thumb|left|La Audiencia Beach in Manzanillo]]
The state covers a territory of 5,455&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and is the fourth smallest federal entity after [[Tlaxcala]], [[Morelos]] and the [[Mexico City|Federal District of Mexico City]], containing only 0.3% of the country's total territory.<ref name="mediofisico">{{cite web |url=http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/Colima/ |title=Medio Físico |year=2005 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Colima |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal and Gobierno del Estado de Colima |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Environment |access-date=July 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327111835/http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/Colima/ |archive-date=March 27, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="resumen">{{cite web |url=http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/col/default.aspx?tema=me&e=06 |title=Resumen |publisher=INEGI |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Summary |access-date=July 29, 2011 |archive-date=August 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820093418/http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/col/default.aspx?tema=me&e=06 |url-status=live }}</ref> The state is in the middle of [[Pacific Coast of Mexico|Mexico's Pacific coast]], bordered by the Pacific Ocean and the states of [[Jalisco]] and [[Michoacán]].

Colima's territory includes the [[Revillagigedo Islands]]—Socorro, San Benedicto, Clarión, and Roca Partida. These are under federal jurisdiction but are considered part of the municipality of [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]].<ref name="mediofisico"/>

Politically, the state is divided into ten [[Municipalities of Mexico|municipalities]].<ref name="resumen"/> Natural geography divides the state into a northern and southern region. The north has a cooler climate due to the higher mountains. The south is hotter and includes the Pacific Ocean coastline. The Revillagigedo Islands, of volcanic origin, are dispersed along the 19° north parallel over an area of about 400&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>—with a total landmass of 205&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.

The altitude varies from sea level to 3,839&nbsp;m (12,595&nbsp;ft) at the crater of the [[Volcán de Colima]].<ref name="regionalizacion">{{cite web |url=http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/Colima/ |title=Regionalizacion |year=2005 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Colima |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal and Gobierno del Estado de Colima |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Regions |access-date=July 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327111835/http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/Colima/ |archive-date=March 27, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The state is in an offshoot of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] mountain range and geographically consists of four mountain systems. The most important of these is the Cerro Grande and its related peaks of Jurípicho-Juluapan, Los Juanillos, La Astilla, El Ocote, El Peón, El Barrigón, San Diego, and La Media Luna. The second consists of mountain chains parallel to the coast between the Marabasco and Armería Rivers, which include El Espinazo del Diablo, El Escorpión, El Tigre, El Aguacate, El Centinela, El Tora and La Vaca. The third is located between the Armería and Salado Rivers and includes the Alcomún y Partida, San Miguel y Comala and San Gabriel/Callejones peaks. The last is between the Salado and Naranjo or Coahuayana Rivers and contains small mountain chains such as the Piscila, Volcancillos, La Palmera, El Camichín and Copales. Three quarters of the state is covered by mountains and hills.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

At the very north of the state, the border is marked by two volcanoes. The [[Volcán de Colima|Colima Volcano]], also called the Volcán de Fuego, is active and the [[Nevado de Colima]] is not. The Nevado de Colima is taller at 4,271&nbsp;m (14,013&nbsp;ft) and gives its name to the national park that surrounds it. The Colima Volcano, 3825&nbsp;m (12,549&nbsp;ft), has a pyramidal peak, in contrast to the other, which has been leveled somewhat.<ref name="nevadodes">{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/nevado-de-colima-colima.html |title=Nevado de Colima, Colima |date=June 30, 2010 |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |language=es |access-date=July 29, 2011 |archive-date=September 30, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930001817/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/nevado-de-colima-colima.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The last major eruptions of the Colima Volcano occurred in 1998 and 1999.<ref name="rincones30">{{cite book |editor1-first=Victor Manuel |editor1-last=Jiménez González |title=Colima:Guía para descubrir los encantos del estado |trans-title=Colima: Guide to discover the charms of the state |year=2009 |publisher=Editorial Océano de México SA de CV |location=Mexico City |language=es |isbn=978-607-400-172-3 |pages=30}}</ref>

The main rivers of the state are the [[Cihuatlán River]], also called the Chacala, Marabasco, or Paticajo, which forms the state's border with Jalisco on the west; the [[Armería River|Armería]], which descends from the Sierra de Cacoma and crosses the state north–south into the Pacific, and the [[Coahuayana River]], which forms Colima's eastern border with Michoacán. The Salado is another important river, which flows entirely within Colima before emptying into the Coahuayana. Many of the state's streams and arroyos empty into the Salado.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

Colima has a relatively short coastline, at 139&nbsp;km (1.2% of Mexico's total). It extends from the Boca de Apiza to the Cerro de San Francisco in front of [[Barra de Navidad, Jalisco]].<ref name="mediofisico"/><ref name="territorio">{{cite web |url=http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/col/territorio/default.aspx?tema=me&e=06 |title=Territorio |publisher=INEGI |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Territory |access-date=July 29, 2011 |archive-date=August 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808111745/http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/col/territorio/default.aspx?tema=me&e=06 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Coastal lagoons include the Potrero Grande in Manzanillo along with the Miramar and the San Pedrito. On the Tecomán municipality coast there are the lagoons of Alcuzahua and Amela, with the Cuyutlán lagoon split between the municipalities of Armería and Manzanillo. Inland, there are various fresh water lakes, with the larger ones near the coast and smaller ones in the [[Valley of Colima]]. The valley lakes are fed by the runoff from the Colima Volcano and include the Carrizalillo, Las Cuatas, El Jabalí, El Calaboso, La María and La Escondida.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

The predominant climate is hot and relatively moist, with the coast particularly moist. One exception is the [[Tecomán, Colima|Tecomán]] municipality where the climate is dry and very hot. The mildest climates are in the municipalities of [[Comala, Colima|Comala]] and [[Cuauhtémoc, Colima|Cuauhtémoc]]. On the coast, the average temperature varies from between 24 and 26&nbsp;°C and inland, at the highest elevations, the temperature averages between 20 and 22&nbsp;°C.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

Cropland covers 27% of the state's territory, with another 28% dedicated to pasture. Forest covers 35% with the rest composed of bodies of water and urban areas. Most wild vegetation in the west of the state consists of moderately [[deciduous]] rainforest of medium height. Plants that lose leaves do so in the dry season. These include commercially important trees such as [[Juniperus virginiana|red cedar]], {{Lang|es|caobilla}} (''[[Couratara guianensis]]''), {{Lang|es|parota}} (''[[Enterolobium cyclocarpum]]'')—and trees locally known as {{Lang|es|primavera, rosa morada, habillo, payolo, pelillo, barsino}}, and {{Lang|es|salatón}}. From the west of Manzanillo and into the municipalities of [[Armería, Colima|Armería]] and [[Coquimatlán]], there is rainforest of medium height with tree species such as {{Lang|es|copal}} (''[[Bursera]]'') and {{Lang|es|cuajilote}} (''[[Parmentiera aculeatea]]''), with some pines, [[oak]]s, and salt friendly [[mangrove]] forests and scrub.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

There is great diversity of wildlife species although a number of mammal species, such as [[ocelot]]s, [[Cougar|puma]]s, [[wild boar]] and deer, are disappearing. Among the state's rodents is the [[Magdalena rat]] (''Xenomys nelsoni''), a small rare animal little known outside Colima. Bird species include wild turkeys, although these have mostly disappeared, and a bird called the [[chachalaca]]. A number of ducks and other migratory birds pass through. Reptiles include crocodiles, with a nursery in Tecomán dedicated to their survival. It is also one of three Mexican states where the [[tarantula]] species ''[[Brachypelma hamorii]]'' is found, the other two being [[Michoacán]] and [[Jalisco]].

These forests are mostly [[rainforest]], with some areas of [[Quercus agrifolia|holm oak]]. Lumber harvesting has decreased in the state owing to conservation measures.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

Fishing is concentrated on the coastline in ocean waters of about 641&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> as well as in 8,350 hectares of lagoons and 2,032 inland bodies of waters. There are also about 3,000 hectares dedicated to fish farming. Fish production has increased considerably since the 1980s. This is mostly due to more intensive ocean activities, but fish production from rivers and lakes has also grown, at about twelve percent.

Principal catches include tuna and squid, in which Colima ranks nationally at third and fourth place respectively. Other commercial species include [[huachinango]]s, [[red porgy]], [[comber (fish)|combers]], [[wahoo]], and [[mojarra]]. Fish farming mostly concerns raising shrimp along lakes and lagoons, such as Cuyutlán, Chupadero, and Potrero Grande, with an annual production of about 5,000 tons. Some oyster raising takes place as well.

The fishing industry in the state supports a canning industry mostly for tuna, shrimp and octopus along with the freezing of fish filets.<ref name="actecon"/>

Mining, construction, and utilities employ 18.5% of the population and generate 27.53% of the GDP. Half of this is from production of electricity, gas, and water services.

Colima's most important tourism destination is the beaches of [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]], which is popular among those in western Mexico as well as many sports fishermen. Historically, the port was the point of departure for various maritime expeditions and received the annual [[Manila Galleon]] from the [[Philippines]]. It has called itself the "World Capital of the Sailfish" since 1957 when 336 species were caught off its shores. The abundance of this fish along with marlin has made it a popular destination with sports fishermen and the city holds the annual Dorsey International fishing tournament.<ref name="conociendo"/> It is not as well known or as visited as other Pacific destinations such as [[Puerto Vallarta]], despite long sandy beaches and docks for cruise ships. In the 2000s, the city worked to renovate its downtown, with all buildings now showing white facades and many with red tile roofs.<ref name="cargo2cruise"/>

The second most important destination is the small town of [[Comala, Colima|Comala]], a small traditional town near the capital of Colima. Comala was named a "[[Pueblo Mágico]]" in 2002 because of its natural surroundings and traditional architecture, which its downtown declared a historic monument. Since 1962, all the buildings in the town have been painted white and most have red tile roofs, giving it the nickname of "White Village of America."<ref name="monumentosgob">{{cite web |url=http://www.colima-estado.gob.mx/cultura/contenido.php?iw=78 |title=Monumentos Historicos |publisher=State of Colima |location=Colima, Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Historic Monuments |access-date=July 29, 2011 |archive-date=July 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713012925/http://www.colima-estado.gob.mx/cultura/contenido.php?iw=78 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="conocomala">{{cite web |url=http://www.visitacolima.com.mx/comala/comala.html |title=Conociendo Comala |publisher=Secretaria de Turismo de Colima |location=Colima, Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Getting to know Comala |access-date=July 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002065600/http://www.visitacolima.com.mx/comala/comala.html |archive-date=October 2, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Most of the other attractions of the state are related to its history, and most of these are in and around the capital city of Colima. The former state government palace is located in the center of the city of Colima and dates from the 19th century. The main stairwell contains a mural by Colima painter [[Jorge Chávez Carrillo]]. The Palacio Federal is near Jardín Núñez in the city of Colima and dates from the beginning of the 20th century.

==Culture==
[[File:Manzanillo Mexico.jpg|thumb|Manzanillo harbor]]
Indigenous, and Spanish cultures have played a part in the shaping of the state, although traces can be hidden in modern local cultures and traditions. Most crafts and dances of the state are of indigenous origin although some originated after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]]. The Spanish contributed to bullfighting and charreada.

The most popular folk dances in the state include some that tell the story of the Spanish conquest—under various names, such as ''Conquista,'' ''Virgin of Guadalupe,'' ''capotes,'' and ''the fox.'' Another popular dance is called ''Apaches.'' These originated in the colonial period, along with ''Moros y Cristianos'' and ''machines.'' Dances with indigenous roots include ''sonajera India'' and ''morenos.''

Pastorales, or short plays with religious themes, are traditions that began in the very early colonial period. A popular one from that time is the ''Adoration of the Three Wise Men,'' though it has evolved to meet modern tastes.<ref name="fiestasgob">{{cite web |url=http://www.colima-estado.gob.mx/cultura/contenido.php?iw=76 |title=Fiestas, Danzas y Tradiciones |publisher=State of Colima |location=Colima, Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Festivals, Dances and Traditions |access-date=July 29, 2011 |archive-date=July 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716000451/http://www.colima-estado.gob.mx/cultura/contenido.php?iw=76 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Colima has a number of important local festivals and other annual events. January 6 is the ''Los Chayacates de Ixtlahuacán''—a mix of indigenous and Catholic practices based on the pastorale and the cultivation cycle of corn. On the Tuesday after [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] is the "Entrance of the Señor de la Expiración" in Rancho de Villa. On this date, the image returns to this village from [[Coquimatlán]].

In addition to bullfights and [[charreada]]s, mojigangas are featured. The Paspaques of Suchitlán—an agricultural ritual of pre-Hispanic origin—is celebrated by the [[Nahua peoples|Nahuas]] of this small village on March 19. It centers on preparing corn in various ways, such as tortillas, tamales, [[pozole]], and more. [[Holy Week]] is a major event in many municipalities, which often hold passion plays during the week.<ref name="fiestasgob"/>

==Communications and transportation==
===Transport===
[[File:Aeropuerto Internacional Playa de Oro.JPG|thumb|Playa de Oro airport in Manzanillo]]
The most important transportation hub in the state is the port of Manzanillo, handling 91.3% of the shipping of the state and the immediate region.<ref name="xochitl65to66"/> It also operates as an overflow port for the commercial and industrial zones of western Mexico, the [[Bajío]] area and the center of Mexico, but handles overflow from as far as Los Angeles.

===Media===
There are eight AM radio stations operating in the state and five FM stations. Most are in Colima and Manzanillo. There is no local television station with programming coming from Mexico City and through cable. Telephone service covers the entire state but rural areas still use analog.

==History==

===Name and seal===
The formal name of the state is "Estado Libre y Soberano de Colima" (Free and Sovereign State of Colima). The state is named after the [[Colima City|capital city of Colima]]. This name is most likely derived from a [[Nahuatl]] phrase "coliman", but the original meaning is in doubt with two most accepted versions. One interpretation means "place in the hand of the grandfather" with "grandfather" possibly referring to the volcano. The other interpretation is "place in the hands of the ancestors".<ref name="conocolima">{{cite web |url=http://www.visitacolima.com.mx/Colima/colima.html |title=Conociendo Colima |publisher=Secretaria de Turismo de Colima |location=Colima, Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Getting to know Colima |access-date=July 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328083949/http://www.visitacolima.com.mx/Colima/colima.html |archive-date=March 28, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="nomenclatura">{{cite web |url=http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/Colima/ |title=Nomenclatura |year=2005 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Colima |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal and Gobierno del Estado de Colima |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Nomenclature |access-date=July 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327111835/http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/Colima/ |archive-date=March 27, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A third interpretation is based on an interpretation of Colima's glyph as it appears in the [[Nomina codex|Nomina]] and [[Codex Mendoza|Mendocino]] codices, which has a bent arm with the hand turned and water on the shoulder. This glyph is still used in the state's seal. This interpretation would then be "place where the waters bend".<ref name="nomenclatura"/>

===Pre-Hispanic period===
[[File:Campana ed5.JPG|thumb|Pyramid in [[La Campana (archaeological site)|La Campana]]]]
The state was home to a number of pre-Hispanic cultures as part of Western Mexico.<ref name="conocolima"/> Archeological evidence dates human occupation of the area as far back as 1500 BCE, with sites here contemporary with San Lorenzo on the Gulf Coast and [[Tlatilco]] in the [[Valley of Mexico]]. One period of the area's development is called the Los Ortices era, which began around 500 BCE. During this time the elements that characterize the pre-Hispanic peoples of Colima appear, including shaft tombs and a distinctive ceramic style called ''rojo bruñido,'' or burnished red.

The next phase, called Comala and centered on a site of the same name, was from around 100 to 600 CE. Comala people perfected burnished red pottery and created representations of people and animals with skill and fluid lines. The best known of these figures are known as the ''fattened dogs''. The Comala site shows influence from [[Teotihuacan]]. Around 500 CE, another site in Armería developed along the river of the same name.<ref name="enchis"/>

The [[El Chanal|Chanal]] site was active from the 6th to the 15th centuries and was the main culture for the Colima area. Belonging to this culture was a number of smaller sites and most of the ones known and explored to date. After Chanal the largest related site is [[La Campana (archaeological site)|La Campana]] but most contain pyramidal bases and plazas with structures often containing rounded edges. Images of [[Huehueteotl]] and [[Tlaloc]] appear with this culture, which may indicate the origins of the cultures that ultimately settled central Mexico.<ref name="enchis"/>

There is one other site called Periquillo, which indicates one late migration into Colimas around the 10th century from the north.<ref name="enchis"/>

At the beginning of the 16th century, the [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]]s invaded the territory of the [[Tecos people|Tecos]] and got as far as the salt fields of Tzacoalco. A chief named [[Colimotl]] or Colliman defeated the P'urhépechas during the [[Saltpeter War (Mexico)|Saltpeter War]] (1480-1510) (Guerra del Salitre). After this, the Tecos conquered Sayula, Zapotlán and Amunla, making them the dominant cultural group in this part of the state.<ref name="conocolima"/><ref name="rincones29">{{cite book |editor1-first=Victor Manuel |editor1-last=Jiménez González |title=Colima:Guía para descubrir los encantos del estado |trans-title=Colima: Guide to discover the charms of the state |year=2009 |publisher=Editorial Océano de México SA de CV |location=Mexico City |language=es |isbn=978-607-400-172-3 |pages=29}}</ref> Both the Periquillo and Chanal sites were occupied when the Spanish arrived in the 16th century.<ref name="enchis"/>

===Colonial era===
After conquering the [[Aztec]]s and the Purépecha, the Spanish made incursions into Colima.<ref name="conocolima"/> The first incursion into the Colima area occurred under [[Juan Rodríguez de Villafuerte]] in 1522 but was defeated by the natives of the Tecomán Valley.<ref name="enchis"/> Hernán Cortés then sent [[Gonzalo de Sandoval]] to defeat the Tecos, which he did at the Paso de Alima and the Palenque de Tecomán.<ref name="enchis"/><ref name="rincones29"/> Sandoval then established the first Spanish settlement in the Colima Valley called [[Caxitlán]] in 1523, making it the third oldest functioning city government in Mexico and the second municipality of western [[New Spain]].<ref name="enchis"/><ref name="conocolima"/> In 1527, Francisco Cortés de San Buenaventura moved the Spanish settlement to its current located and changing the name to San Sebastián de Colima.<ref name="enchis"/>

[[Revillagigedo Islands|Revillagigedo Archipelago]] was brought to colonial attention in 1533 by [[Hernando de Grijalva]]. The state's first port at Tzalahua would be an important site for about 300 years of Spanish colonial rule as a line of defense and a commercial center.<ref name="conocolima"/>

After the Conquest, the native population was reduced drastically. Some estimations state that the population declines from 150,000 in 1523 to 15,000 in 1554, rebounding somewhat in the 17th century. This population reduction led to the introduction of African slaves and indigenous people from neighboring regions.<ref name="enchis"/>

Evangelization was carried out by the [[Franciscan order|Franciscans]] who established the San Francisco de Coliman monastery in 1554 then the Almoloyan monastery.<ref name="rincones29"/> They would be followed by the [[Mercedarians]] and the Brothers of Saint John of the Cross. It was originally made part of the diocese of [[Morelia|Valladolid (Morelia)]].<ref name="enchis"/>

The port of [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]], then called Santiago de Buena Esperanza, played a large part in the expeditions northwards ordered by [[Hernán Cortés]], which later led to the European discovery of ''[[The Californias|Las Californias]]'' — the [[Baja California Peninsula]] and [[Alta California]]. Cortés de San Buenaventura set out to conquer towards the north, covering the rest of the state and into what is now southern Sinaloa. Later the port would be a target for pirates as the [[Manila galleon]]s would unload materials from the [[Spanish East Indies]] here. These pirates would include [[Francis Drake]] and [[Thomas Cavendish]]. The last major battle against pirates at Manzanillo was in 1615 with Captain Sebastián Vizcaino defending the port against Dutch pirate [[Joris van Speilbergen]].<ref name="enchis"/>

Colima lost territory during the colonial period to 1822, and further into the 19th century. With the creation of [[Nueva Galicia]] in 1531, it lost its territories north of the Cihuatlán or Marabasco River and the region south of [[Lake Chapala]]. In 1550, Colima lost the provinces of Autlán and Amula. By the end of the 16th century, it lost the Motines region, now part of Michoacán and in the 19th century the Xilotlán region to Jalisco.<ref name="enchis"/>

From the early colonial period, Colima was a province that answered to Mexico City. In 1789, the parish of Colima was incorporated into the diocese of Guadalajara. In 1796, Colima was converted into a sub delegation of the province of Guadalajara.<ref name="enchis"/>

One colonial area industry in Colima was the production of "coconut wine" — an alcoholic beverage distilled from [[date palm]] fruit and [[coconut]]. One of the first introduced crops was [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]] in the 16th century, with coconut, [[sugar cane]], and cotton coming after. Other crops such as rice, [[indigo]] and vanilla would be introduced later.<ref name="enchis"/>

===Independence to the present===
In the early 19th century, the commercial port of Manzanillo was opened to domestic and international traffic for a brief time. The first Colima newspaper called "El Observador de las Leyes" was published at this time as well.<ref name="enchis"/>

With the outbreak of the [[Mexican War of Independence]], authorities arrested the head of Indian communities along with suspected insurgents in October 1810. This was despite the fact that [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] groups had organized to defend against the insurgents upon hearing that they were enemies of the king and planned to destroy churches. One accused insurgent was José Antonio Díaz, the parish priest of Almoloyán and friend of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]]. Later he would join the insurgent army. During the war, the city of Colima was taken by the insurgents Jose Antonio Torres at the end of 1810 without resistance and taken back by the royalist army in 1811.<ref name="enchis"/><ref name="conocolima"/> In 1811, royalist troops defeated the insurgents under José Calixto Martinez at the Battle of Los Llanos de Santa Juana. Insurgents took back the city in 1812 under the command of Ignacio Sandoval and Miguel Gallaga. In 1813, the city was in royalist hands with the city swearing allegiance to the monarchist constitution. In 1821 the [[Plan of Iguala]] for Mexican independence was proclaimed in the city, and accepted by local authorities. Immediately after Independence, Colima was still a subdelegation of Guadalajara. In 1821, Colima lost the Zapotlán areas along with the towns of Tecalitlán and Xilotlán, but gained the town of Tonila. This and earlier losses of territory would define the area's modern borders.<ref name="enchis"/>

In 1824, with [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Mexico's first constitution]], Colima was an [[Colima Territory|independent territory]]. It integrated with Michoacán in 1837. In 1846, it became a separate territory again, and in 1856, was made a state with the triumph of the Liberals. Its status as a state was reaffirmed by the [[Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States of 1857|1857 Mexican Constitution]] and General Manuel Alvarez was declared its first constitutional governor.<ref name="enchis"/><ref name="conocolima"/>

Colima served as a provisional seat for [[Benito Juárez]]'s Liberal government in 1858 during the [[Reform War]]. In 1861, the Revillagigedo Islands were added to Colima's territory. [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French troops entered the city]] in 1864, dissolving the state congress, with Colima becoming a department in 1865. In 1867, Republican troops under Ramon Corona retook the city.<ref name="enchis"/> Colima became a diocese independent of Guadalajara in 1881.<ref name="diocesehis">{{cite web |url=http://www.diocesisdecolima.org/index.php/historia/diocesis |title=Historia de la Diócesis |publisher=Diocese of Colima |location=Colima, Mexico |language=es |trans-title=History of the Diocese |access-date=July 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205003646/http://www.diocesisdecolima.org/index.php/historia/diocesis |archive-date=December 5, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The latter part of the 19th century saw the introduction of industry with textile factories such as La Armonía, La Atrevida and San Cayetano. The [[telegraph]] arrived to the state in 1869 to connect the capital and the port of Manzanillo. Similarly, the telephone service was added in 1883. Railroad service between the two cities began in 1889 and a city tram was added to the capital in 1892.<ref name="enchis"/>

During the [[Mexican Revolution]], there were no major battles but there were local clashes. In 1911, troops loyal to [[Francisco I. Madero]] entered Colima and suspended the state congress. After the war, social organizations that would mark Mexico's development for much of the 20th century were created in Colima as well, especially [[ejido]]s, with the one in Suchitlán being the first. Another important movement was the creation of workers' unions and cooperatives such as the Unión de Estibadores in Manzanillo. In 1919, President [[Venustiano Carranza]] created the Sociedad Cooperativa de Salineros in the city of Colima with the exclusive rights to extract salt from Cuyutlán Lake. These changes were imposed by federal authorities outside of Colima, leading to political instability within the state, especially during elections.<ref name="enchis"/>

Federal intervention from Mexico City continued into the 1920s, with a number of laws to reform schools, hospitals and other institutions, which before had been mostly operated by the Catholic Church. This was opposed by many in the state who supported the Church's formerly prominent role in political and social affairs. The Ley de Cultos (Religion Law) of 1926 gave rise to the [[Cristero War]] pitting those favoring the Catholic Church against those favoring agrarian and socialist reform. Battles and skirmishes related to this conflict took place in a number of locales in Mexico but it caused severe problems in Colima, causing major divisions with no formal resolution.<ref name="enchis"/>

Textile production that began in the 19th century ended by the mid 20th century, though farmers continued to grow cotton to ship to Guadalajara. In the 1940s, the Tecomán Valley began to be intensively cultivated, creating a new source income for the state, with limes as the principle crop, and leading to the development of agro-industry.<ref name="enchis"/>
[[File:Colima University Hall.png|thumb|Colima University Hall "Coronel Pedro Torres Ortiz"]]
The [[University of Colima|Universidad (Popular) de Colima]] was founded in 1942.<ref name="enchis"/>

Much of the history of the latter 20th century into the present revolves around economic development. [[1959 Mexico hurricane|A hurricane]] devastated the state in 1959. The Plan Colima was conceived and executed to improve the general infrastructure of the state during the 1980s by then Mexican president Miguel de la Madrid. It was prompted mostly by road congestion due to port shipping in Manzanillo as well as the growing tourism sector. It was designed to facilitate in-state transportation and connect the state better to the rest of Mexico. The main aspect of the plan was the construction of highways such as the highway that connects Manzanillo to Guadalajara and then onto [[Tampico]]. This highway was amplified at the end of the decade and made a toll road on approach to Manzanillo. The last decades have seen a new wave of industrial construction with the building of facilities for businesses such as [[Cementos Apasco]], [[Citrojugo]], [[Brun Foods]], Embotelladora de Tecomán, Consorcio Minero Benito Juárez-Peña Colorada, Grupo Agroindustrial de Occidente, AMTEX and others.<ref name="xochitl65to66"/>

Mexico's struggles with drug traffickers include the state, which is along Pacific Coast smuggling routes. For the first quarter of 2011, there were 52 registered homicides in the state, most linked to organized crime. This is significantly higher than previous years with most of these occurring in Colima, Villa de Alvarez and Manzanillo.<ref name="ejecutados">{{cite news |title=52 ejecutados en Colima en cuatro meses |url=http://www.colimanoticias.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=13270:52-ejecutados-en-colima-en-cuatro-meses&catid=1:Ultimas%20Noticias |newspaper=Colima Noticias |location=Colima, Mexico |access-date=July 29, 2011 |language=es |trans-title=52 executed in Colima in four months |archive-date=March 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307015836/http://colimanoticias.com/index.php?catid=1:ultimas%20noticias&id=13270:52-ejecutados-en-colima-en-cuatro-meses&option=com_content&view=article |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Archaeology==
A very early culture in Colima was [[Capacha]] culture, developing in the region between 2000 and 1200 BCE.

[[El Chanal]] is located four km north of the city of Colima. It is a complex of pyramid platforms with stairs, a Mesoamerican ballcourt and a number of plazas. A distinctive feature of the site are stones with glyphs that are found on stairways.<ref name="monumentosgob"/>

La Campana is in the urban area of Villa de Álvarez. It is a ceremonial center with various temples and pyramidal platforms with rounded edges. At least one of the platforms was used as a mausoleum with the tomb inside still visible.<ref name="monumentosgob"/>

==Education==
The state has 307 preschools, 510 primary schools, 131 middle schools and 57 high school and vocational level schools. Today, over 85% of the population finishes primary school. Just under 90% of those who start middle school finish. Over 91% of the population over the age of 15 is literate.<ref name="infraes"/> About 12% of the population has a university level education and 26% less than primary.<ref name="actecon"/>

High school level education is available in all regions of the state, with just under sixty percent of those starting a program finishing it, with most that do not dropping out.<ref name="infraes"/>

The state system also has schools dedicated to special education, vocational training and early childhood centers for those needing various types of physical and educational therapy. Literacy programs for adults are handled by [[Instituto Nacional para la Educación de los Adultos|INEA]] and [[Consejo Nacional de Fomento Educativo|CONAFE]].<ref name="infraes"/>

Higher education consists of a number of technological schools, universities and teachers' colleges. Just over half of these are located in the city of Colima, with about 19% in Villa de Alvarez and eleven percent in Tecomán. Most technology related higher education is provided by the [[:es:Instituto Tecnológico de Colima|Instituto Tecnológico de Colima]], with 76% of the students, followed by [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education|ITESM-Colima]] with 7.6% and [[:es:Instituto Autónomo de Educación Superior de Tecomán|Instituto Autónomo de Educación Superior de Tecomán]] with 16.2%. Most of the general university education is provided by the [[University of Colima]] (over 93%) with the rest attending the [[:es:Universidad Autónoma del Pacífico|Universidad Autónoma del Pacífico]]. The main teachers' colleges are the [http://www.isencolima.edu.mx/ Instituto Superior de Educación Normal de Colima] and the [[National Pedagogic University (Mexico)|Universidad Pedagógica Nacional]]. The main providers of post graduate education are the University of Colima and ITESM-Colima.<ref name="infraes"/>

The University of Colima was founded in 1940, following the educational philosophy of President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] meant to provide higher education to the poorer classes. Today, the university offers high school level classes along with undergraduate and graduate degrees. Much of the institution's current size and offering is due to growth in the 1980s, and during that time its reputation in Mexico and abroad increased. Most of the university's majors are concentrated in agriculture, industry and commerce with aim of enhancing Colima's economy.<ref name="ucolhis">{{cite web |url=http://www.ucol.mx/universidad/historia.php |title=Historia |publisher=University of Colima |location=Colima, Mexico |language=es |trans-title=History |access-date=July 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913211522/http://www.ucol.mx/universidad/historia.php |archive-date=September 13, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Instituto Tecnológico de Colima was founded in 1976 with three majors in engineering and business with the aim of providing an alternative education focusing on preparing students for industry and service markets. Since then it has added majors in biotechnology, computer science, mechatronics and architecture, offering six undergraduate degrees and one master's degree.<ref name="TecColhis">{{cite web |url=http://www.itcolima.edu.mx/institucion/historia.php |title=Historia |publisher=Instituto Tecnológico de Colima |location=Colima, Mexico |language=es |trans-title=History |access-date=July 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205003356/http://www.itcolima.edu.mx/institucion/historia.php |archive-date=December 5, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
