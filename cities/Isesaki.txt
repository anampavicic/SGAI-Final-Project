==History==
Isesaki developed during the [[Sengoku period]] as a [[jōkamachi|castle town]] surrounding Akaishi Castle, a stronghold in southern [[Kōzuke Province]] controlled by the Yura clan. During the [[Edo period]], it was the center of [[Isesaki Domain]], a [[han system|feudal domain]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] controlled by the [[Sakai clan]]. The area also contained two [[shukuba|post town]]s on the [[Nikkō Reiheishi Kaidō]], a subroute to [[Nikkō Kaidō]] which connected the [[Nakasendō]]  directly with Nikkō, bypassing [[Edo]].<ref name="reihei">[http://t-mainichi.jp/gunma/kaidou_box/kaidou/2_reiheishi.html Nikkō Reiheishidō] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929063000/http://t-mainichi.jp/gunma/kaidou_box/kaidou/2_reiheishi.html |date=2007-09-29 }}. Mainichi Shinbun. Accessed August 29, 2007.</ref><ref name="takasaki">[http://www.city.takasaki.gunma.jp/soshiki/kankou/kankou/nakasen.htm Old Nakasendo: Kuragano-shuku and Takasaki-shuku] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822002852/http://www.city.takasaki.gunma.jp/soshiki/kankou/kankou/nakasen.htm |date=2007-08-22 }}. City of Takasaki. Accessed August 29, 2007.</ref>

Isesaki Town was created within [[Sai District, Gunma]] Prefecture on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system after the [[Meiji Restoration]]. Sai District and [[Nawa District, Gunma|Nawa District]] merged to form [[Sawa District, Gunma|Sawa District]] in 1896. It merged with the villages of Uehasu and Moro to form the city of Isesaki on September 13, 1940. On January 10, 1955 the village of Misato was annexed by Isesaki, followed by the villages of Nawa, Toyouke and Miyagō on March 25 of the same year.

On January 1, 2005 the towns of [[Akabori, Gunma|Akabori]] and [[Sakai, Gunma|Sakai]], and village of Azuma were incorporated into Isesaki. On April 1, 2007, Isesaki was proclaimed a [[Special cities of Japan|special city (''tokureishi'')]] with increased autonomy.

==Government==
Isesaki has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 29 members. Isesaki contributes five members to the Gunma Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the [[Gunma 2nd district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Isesaki (along with neighboring [[Kiryū, Gunma|Kiryū]]) was traditionally famous for [[sericulture]] since ancient times, with a cloth called "Isesaki Meisen" as one of its most famous products. This cloth has been made since the late 17th century, and became popular during the [[Meiji era|Meiji]] and [[Taishō period]]s. Now, however, due to the ubiquity of Western-style clothes, its popularity is decreasing.

The [[Automotive industry|automotive equipment]] and [[electrical equipment]] manufacturing company [[Sanden Corporation]] is headquartered in Isesaki.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sanden.co.jp/english/company/about.html |title=Sanden Corporation company profile |access-date=March 15, 2014 |archive-date=April 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190413040129/https://www.sanden.co.jp/english/company/about.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Also the city is home to [[Meisei Electric]], a [[communications equipment|communications]] and [[electronics|electronics equipment]] and [[Measuring instrument|electric measuring instruments]] manufacturing company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meisei.co.jp/english/aboutus/outline |title=About Meisei Electric |access-date=March 15, 2014}}</ref> Large [[industrial park]]s have been built in the suburbs, making it one of the leading industrial cities in the northern Kantō region.
