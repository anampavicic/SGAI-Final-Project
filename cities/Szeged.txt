'''Szeged''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|ɡ|ɛ|d}} {{respell|SEG|ed}}, {{IPA-hu|ˈsɛɡɛd|lang|hu-Szeged.ogg}}; <small>see also [[#Etymology|other alternative names]]</small>) is [[List of cities and towns of Hungary#Largest cities in Hungary|the third largest city]] of [[Hungary]], the largest city and regional centre of the [[Southern Great Plain]] and the [[county seat]] of [[Csongrád-Csanád County|Csongrád-Csanád county]]. The [[University of Szeged]] is one of the most distinguished universities in Hungary.

The Szeged Open Air (Theatre) Festival (first held in 1931) is one of the main attractions, held every summer and celebrated as the Day of the City on 21 May.

== Etymology ==
It is possible that the name ''Szeged'' is a [[mutation (linguistics)|mutated]] and truncated form of the final syllables of ''[[Partiscum (castra)|Partiscum]]'', the name of a Roman colony founded in the 2nd century, on or near the site of modern Szeged. In [[Latin language]] contexts, {{lang|la|Partiscum}} has long been assumed to be synonymous with ''Szeged''. The Latin name is also the basis of the city's [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] name {{lang|el|Παρτίσκον}} ''Partiskon''.

However, ''Szeged'' might instead have originated (or been influenced by) an old [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] word for "corner" ({{lang|hu|szeg}}), pointing to the turn of the river [[Tisza]] that flows through the city. Others say it derives from the Hungarian word {{lang|hu|sziget}} which means "island". Others still contend that {{lang|hu|szeg}} means "dark blond" ({{lang|hu|sötétszőkés}}) – a reference to the color of the water where the rivers [[Tisza]] and [[Mureș (river)|Maros]] merge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.szegedportal.hu/index.php?pg=101|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018021019/http://www.szegedportal.hu/index.php?pg=101|url-status=dead|title=On etymology|archive-date=18 October 2007}}</ref> 

Szeged has a variety of names in languages other than Hungarian. These are usually formed by the addition of a suffix ''-in'' to the Hungarian name: [[Romanian language|Romanian]] {{lang|ro|Seghedin}}; [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|Szegedin}} or {{lang|de|Segedin}}; [[Serbo-Croatian]] {{lang|sh|Segedin|script=Latin}}/{{lang|sh|Сегедин|script=Cyrillic}}; [[Italian language|Italian]] {{lang|it|Seghedino}};  [[Latvian language|Latvian]] {{lang|lv|Segeda}}; [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] {{lang|lt|Segedas}}; [[Polish language|Polish]] {{lang|pl|Segedyn}}; [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Czech language|Czech]] {{lang|sk|Segedín}}; [[Turkish language|Turkish]] {{lang|tr|Segedin}}.

== History ==
[[File:KassVigadóKJ.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Early 20th-century postcard]]

Szeged and its area have been inhabited since ancient times. [[Ptolemy]] mentions the oldest known name of the city: ''Partiscum'' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Πάρτισκον<ref>Klaudios Ptolemaios. Handbuch der Geographie. Griechisch-Deutsch. Herausgegeben von Alfred Stückelberger und Gerd Graßhoff. Schwabe Verlag Basel. 2006, p. 310-311</ref>)''.'' It is possible that [[Attila the Hun|Attila]], king of the [[Huns]] had his seat somewhere in this area. The name Szeged was first mentioned in 1183, in a document of King [[Béla III]].

In the second century AD there was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[trading post]] established on an island in the [[Tisza]], and the foundations of the Szeged castle suggest that the structure may have been built over an even earlier fort. Today only one corner of the castle still remains standing.<ref>Szeged by Dr. Trogmayer Ottó</ref>

During the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasion]] the town was destroyed and its inhabitants fled to the nearby swamps, but they soon returned and rebuilt their town. In the 14th century, during the reign of [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]], Szeged became the most important town of Southern Hungary, and – as the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Turkish armies]] got closer to Hungary – the strategic importance of Szeged grew. King [[Sigismund of Luxembourg]] had a [[city wall|wall]] built around the town. Szeged was raised to [[free royal town]] status in 1498.

Szeged was first pillaged by the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Army]] on 28 September 1526, but was occupied only in 1543, and became an administrative centre of the Ottomans (see [[Ottoman Hungary]]). The town was a [[sanjak]] centre first in [[Budin Province, Ottoman Empire|Budin Eyaleti]] (1543–1596), after in [[Eğri Eyalet]]i. The town was freed from Turkish rule on 23 October 1686, and regained the free royal town status in 1715. In 1719, Szeged received its [[coat of arms]] (still used today) from [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles III]]. During the next several years, Szeged grew and prospered. [[Piarists|Piarist]] monks arrived in Szeged in 1719 and opened a new grammar school in 1721. Szeged also held scientific lectures and theatrical plays. These years brought not only prosperity but also enlightenment. Between 1728 and 1744 [[Witch trials in the early modern period|witch trials]] were frequent in the town, with the [[Szeged witch trials]] of 1728–29 perhaps being the largest. The witch trials were instigated by the authorities, who decided on this measure to remove the problem of the public complaints about the drought and its consequences of famine and epidemics by laying the responsibility on people among them, which had fraternized with the Devil.  In 1720, the ethnic [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] population of the town numbered about 13000 to 16000, while the number of the [[Serbs|Serb]] inhabitants was 1300.<ref>Ádám Fejér, Magyarok és szlávok. (Konferencia, Szeged, 1991. május 30-31). Szerk. Fejér Ádám, H. Tóth Imre stb. (Kiad. a JATE Szláv Filológiai Tansz.), József Attila Tudományegyetem, 1993, p. 262, {{ISBN|9789634819929}}</ref>

The first printing press was established in 1801, and the old town hall and the civil hospital were built at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Farkas |first=József |title=Szeged Története 2 1686-1849 |date=1985 |pages=699 |language=Hungarian}}</ref>

Szeged is known as the home of [[paprika]], a spice made from dried, powdered [[capsicum]] fruits. Paprika arrived in Hungary in the second half of the 16th century as an ornamental plant. About 100 years later the plant was cultivated as an herb, and paprika as we know it.<ref name="paprika">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vickery.tv/acatalog/Paprika.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728021200/http://www.vickery.tv/acatalog/Paprika.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 July 2009|title=Vickery TV Paprika (Hungary)|date=28 July 2009}}</ref> Szeged is also famous for their [[szekelygulyas]], a [[goulash]] made with [[pork]], [[sauerkraut]] and [[sour cream]].<ref name="szekelygulyas">{{Cite web|url=https://www.talktalk.co.uk/notices/web-space-closing.html?accessurl=http://www.fourman.dsl.pipex.com/recipes/szekelygulyas.html|title=TalkTalk Webspace is closing soon!!|website=www.talktalk.co.uk}}</ref> And also famous for their [[halászlé]], [[fish soup]] made of [[carp]] and [[catfish]].

The citizens of Szeged played an important part in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]]. [[Lajos Kossuth]] delivered his famous speech here. Szeged was the last seat of the revolutionary government in July 1849. The [[Habsburg]] rulers punished the leaders of the town, but later Szeged began to prosper again; the railway reached it in 1854, and the town got its free royal town status back in 1860. Mark Pick's shop – the predecessor of today's Pick [[Salami]] Factory – was opened in 1869.
[[File:Szeged, Dugonics tér a nagyárvízkor, szemben a Kálvária-sugárút. Fortepan 15599.jpg|thumb|Szeged during the flood of 1879]]
Today the inner city of Szeged has wide avenues. This is mainly due to the great [[flood]] of 1879, which wiped away the whole town (only 265 of the 5723 houses remained and 165 people died). Emperor [[Franz Joseph]] visited the town and promised that "Szeged will be more beautiful than it used to be". He kept his promise, and during the next years a new, modern city emerged from the ruins, with palaces and wide streets.

===20th century===
[[File:Széchenyi tér, a Zsótér-ház előtti szélesebb járda. Szemben a Kossuth Lajos sugárút torkolata. Fortepan 3593.jpg|thumb|left|Shoppers in Szeged, 1929]]

After the [[Hungary in World War I|First World War]] Hungary lost its southern territories to [[Serbia]], as a result Szeged became a city close to the [[border]], and its importance lessened, but as it took over roles that formerly belonged to the now lost cities, it slowly recovered. Following the Loss of [[Transylvania]] to Romania, University of Kolozsvár (now [[Cluj-Napoca]]), moved to Szeged in 1921 (see [[University of Szeged]]). In 1923 Szeged took over the role of [[Bishop|episcopal]] seat from Temesvár (now [[Timișoara]], Romania). It was briefly occupied by the [[Romanian army]] during [[Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919|Hungarian-Romanian War]] in 1919. It also became a center for right-wing forces which would install [[Miklós Horthy]] as the country's new leader after the overthrow of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781316137024/type/book|title=The Cambridge History of Communism|date=2017-09-21|volume=1 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-316-13702-4|editor-last=Pons|editor-first=Silvio|edition=1|doi=10.1017/9781316137024|editor-last2=Smith|editor-first2=Stephen A.}}</ref> During the 1920s the Jewish population of Szeged grew and reached its zenith.

Szeged suffered heavily during [[Hungary in World War II|World War II]]. 6,000 inhabitants of the city were killed, In 1941, there were 4,161 Jews living in Szeged. After, March 19, 1944 [[Operation Margarethe|German occupation]], they were confined to a [[Nazi ghettos|ghetto]] together with the Jews from surrounding villages. In June, 1944, the ghetto was liquidated. The [[Nazis]] murdered the larger part of the 8,500 and some were forced into [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labor]] in Strasshof Labor camp, Austria.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Holocaust Survivors and Victims Database -- Szeged, Hungary Deportation List|url=https://www.ushmm.org/online/hsv/source_view.php?SourceId=49448&r=p|access-date=2021-02-21|website=www.ushmm.org}}</ref> Szeged was captured by [[Red Army|Soviet]] troops of the [[Steppe Front|2nd Ukrainian Front]] on 11 October 1944 in the course of the [[Battle of Debrecen]]. During the communist era, Szeged became a centre of [[light industry]] and [[food industry]]. In 1965, [[Petroleum|oil]] was found near the city.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}

In 1962, Szeged became the county seat of [[Csongrád-Csanád County|Csongrád]]. Whole new districts were built, and many nearby villages (e.g. [[Tápé]], [[Szőreg]], Kiskundorozsma, [[Szentmihálytelek]], [[Gyálarét]]) were annexed to the city in 1973 (as was a tendency during the [[Hungarian People's Republic|Communist era]]).

Today's Szeged is an important university town and a tourist attraction.

The [[Szeged Symphony Orchestra]] (Szegedi Szimfonikus Zenekar) gives regular concerts at the Szegedi Nemzeti Színház.<ref>[http://www.symph-szeged.hu/ Szeged Symphony Orchestra website], accessed 6 August 2012.</ref>

==Geography==
Szeged is situated near the southern border of [[Hungary]], just to the south of the mouth of the [[Maros River]], on both banks of the [[Tisza River]], nearly in the centre of the [[Carpathian Basin]]. The Hungarian frontier with Serbia is just outside the town.

===Climate===
Szeged's climate is transitional between [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa'') and [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] (Köppen ''Dfa''), with cold winters, hot summers, and fairly low precipitation. Due to the high hours of sunlight reported annually, Szeged is often called ''City of Sunshine'' ({{lang|hu|Napfény városa}}).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.origo.hu/sport/egyeni/20060508anapfeny.html|title=A napfény városa|website=www.origo.hu/|date=8 May 2006 |publisher=New Wave Media Group}}</ref> On 23 July 2022, a maximum temperature of {{convert|40.1|°C}} was registered in Szeged.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ogimet.com/cgi-bin/gsynres?ind=12982&ano=2022&mes=7&day=24&hora=0&min=0&ndays=30|title=12982: Szeged (Hungary)|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 23 July 2022|website=ogimet.com |publisher=[[OGIMET]] |access-date= 24 July 2022|quote=}}</ref>

The ''[[Biological Research Centre]]'' of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]], which was built with the help of [[UNESCO]] funds, has also been a considerable source of advanced research. Scientists at this laboratory were first in the world to produce ''artificial heredity material'' in the year 2000. The building has served as a home to many well known conferences and continues to make contributions to the world of science.

The ''Szent-Györgyi Albert Agóra'' is a cultural scientific centre of Szeged which gives home to laboratories of the Biological Research Centre and to exhibitions of the [[John von Neumann Computer Society]] especially their IT historical exposition.

In 2018 the new scientific institution, the ''[[Extreme Light Infrastructure|ELI]] Attosecond Light Pulse Source'' (ELI-ALPS) opened in Szeged establishing a unique facility which provides light sources within an extremely broad frequency range in the form of ultrashort pulses with high repetition rate which is needed for different kinds of physical experiments especially in the field of [[attosecond physics]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eli-alps.hu/?q=hu/Mi_az_ELI-ALPS|title=ELI-ALPS Research Institute &#124; Towards the sharp end of attoscience|website=www.eli-alps.hu}}</ref>

It is also one of the main options for medical students who come from all around Europe to study Medicine in their recognized international campus.

Szeged is the most important transportation hub in the [[Southern Great Plain]]. Two motorways, [[M5 motorway (Hungary)|M5]] and [[M43 motorway (Hungary)|M43]], lie along the city border. Through the [[M5 motorway (Hungary)|M5 Motorway]] Szeged is connected to [[Kecskemét]], [[Kiskunfélegyháza]] and [[Budapest]] to the north and to [[Subotica]], [[Novi Sad]] and [[Belgrade]] in [[Serbia]] to the south. The [[M43 motorway (Hungary)|M43 Motorway]] – which splits from the M5 Motorway near Szeged – connects the city via [[Makó]] to [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] and [[Timișoara]] in [[Romania]].  In addition, there are other roads running from the city to Makó and [[Nagylak]] (main road 43), to [[Röszke]] (main road 5), to [[Kiskunfélegyháza]] (main road 5), to [[Ásotthalom]] and [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]] (main road 55) and to [[Hódmezővásárhely]], [[Orosháza]] and [[Békéscsaba]] (main road 47).

The Budapest-Szeged-rail line is an important rail connection, as well as the railway lines 121 (to Makó), 135 (to Hódmezővásárhely), 136 (to Röszke) and 140 (to Kiskunfélegyháza).<ref>[Rail transport map of Hungary by the Hungarian Rail Capacity Allocation Office (VPE)]</ref>

A [[tram-train]] system was constructed and inaugurated in November 2021, connecting Szeged with the neighbouring [[Hódmezővásárhely]], thus creating the second most populous [[urban agglomeration]] in the country, after the capital. There was a proposal for its extension, even through the Serbian border, to [[Subotica]].

The city is also a common stop for national and international long-distance buses.

=== Speedway ===
[[Motorcycle speedway]] has had a long association with the city. The first track was at the SZEAC athletics stadium (also known as the Felső Tisza-parti Stadion or Városi stadion), which was located where the Pick Aréna is today.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sulinet.hu/oroksegtar/data/telepulesek_ertekei/szeged/szeged_tortenete_5/pages/026_a_varos_sportja.htm |title=I.

From 1978, the Volán speedway club moved to a new track built on Napos út at Béke telepi. This venue held important events, including qualifying rounds of the [[Speedway World Championship]] in 1983 and 1984<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dlprezes.pl.tl/SPEEDWAY--_--Indywidualne-mistrzostwa-%26%23346%3Bwiata-----------k1-World-Speedway-Championship-k2-.htm |title=World Championship |website=Metal Speedway |access-date=14 February 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.speedway.org/history/ |title=World Championship  | website=Speedway.org |access-date=14 February 2024}}</ref> and a qualifying round of the [[Speedway World Team Cup]] in 1988 and 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalspeedway.co.uk/ |title=Speedway World Cup  | website=International Speedway |access-date=14 February 2024}}</ref> The track closed, partly because of noise issues in a residential area, resulting in the speedway moving out of the city, 25 kilometres west, near to Mórahalom ({{coord|46|10|14|N|19|54|49|E|}}).
