== Recent history and administration ==

Its two cities endured the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq]] and emerged unscathed. In 2004, however, Mosul and Tal Afar were the scenes of fierce battles between [[United States|US]]-led troops and [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–2011)|Iraqi insurgents]]. The insurgents moved to Nineveh after the [[First Battle of Fallujah|Battle of Fallujah]] in 2004.

After the invasion, the military of the province was led by (then Major General) [[David Petraeus]] of the [[101st Airborne Division]] and later by (then Brigadier General) [[Carter Ham]] as the multi-national brigade for Iraq. During the time, the American civil head of the local office of the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] was US Foreign Service Officer and former Kurdish refugee to the States, [[Herro Mustafa]]. Mustafa administered her nominees on the provincial council and through members of the Kashmoula family.

In June 2004, [[Osama Kashmoula]] became the interim governor of the province and in September of the same year he was assassinated en route to Baghdad. He was succeeded as interim Governor by [[Duraid Kashmoula]], who was elected governor in January 2005. Duraid Kashmoula resigned in 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|title= Iraq governor looks back on troubled tenure|first= Ned|last= Parker|url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-jan-22-fg-iraq-governor22-story.html|newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date= 22 January 2009|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120211061836/http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/22/world/fg-iraq-governor22|archive-date= 11 February 2012|url-status= live}}</ref> In April 2009, [[Atheel al-Nujaifi]], a hardline Arab nationalist and member of [[Al-Hadba]], became governor.<ref>{{Cite news|title= In Nineveh, tensions between Iraqi Kurds and Arabs simmer|first= Liz|last= Sly|url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-jun-23-fg-iraq-kurds23-story.html|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date= 23 June 2009|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120212000747/http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/23/world/fg-iraq-kurds23|archive-date= 12 February 2012|url-status= live}}</ref> While al-Nujaifi's Arab [[Muttahidoon]] bloc lost its majority to the Kurdish [[Kurdistan List|Brotherhood and Coexistence Alliance List]] in the [[2013 Ninawa governorate election|2013 provincial election]], al-Nujaifi was reelected as governor by a larger Sunni Arab coalition<ref>{{cite news |author=Abdullah Salem |title=Voter's Revolution in Ninawa – Local minorities take over Provincial government |url=http://www.niqash.org/en/articles/politics/3276/local-minorities-take-over-provincial-govt.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722194559/http://www.niqash.org/en/articles/politics/3276/local-minorities-take-over-provincial-govt.htm |publisher=Niqash |date=22 August 2013 |archive-date=22 July 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> that was later formalized as the [[Nahda Bloc]].
