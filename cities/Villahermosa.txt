Coined "La Esmeralda del Sureste" (The [[Emerald]] of the Southeast), Villahermosa is a modern city with history dating back to the early 1500s. Its natural resources like cacao, sugarcane, bananas, tobacco, rice, and hardwoods has made Villahermosa attractive to domestic investors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Villahermosa-Mexico|title = Villahermosa &#124; Economy, Attractions, History, & Facts &#124; Britannica| date=11 June 2024 }}</ref> The city has become a hub for oil and gas operations in Southern Mexico and is referred to as the “Energy City of Mexico.” The most recent oil finding at the Ogarrio oil field,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/ogarrio-oil-field-expansion-tabasco/|title=Ogarrio Oil Field Expansion, DEA- Pemex,Tabasco, Mexico}}</ref> just 107&nbsp;km west of Villahermosa, make it an important city in the production of hydrocarbon.

== Etymology ==

In 1598, King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] named the city "Villa Hermosa of San Juan Bautista," and granted it use of a royal shield on its coat of arms which is still in use today. In the city's long history, its name changed many times. In 1916, governor Francisco J. Mújica decreed to eliminate the name of "San Juan Bautista," leaving only "Villahermosa."<ref>[https://www.memoriapoliticademexico.org/Biografias/MFJ84.html Francisco J. Mujica Regarding Villahermosa]</ref>

==Symbols of the City==
===Coat of Arms===

On July 24, 1598, King [[Philip II of Spain]] granted the village of San Juan Bautista the title of ''Villa Hermosa of San Juan Bautista'', and afforded them a [[Coat of Arms]]. In 1892, State Congress adopted the coat of arms as the official shield of the state of [[Tabasco]].

The shield incorporates a quarterly heraldry design with a center inescutcheon. The coat of arms depicts the Spanish Imperial Crown for King Charles who served as Emperor and King. 

The first quarter [[gules]] features four castle towers representing the Kingdom of Castile, the Crown of Aragon, the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada, and the Mediterranean Sea, four territories of land and sea. The four castles refer to the four lordships that initially carved up the area after it was conquered by Alfonso X of Castile.<ref>[https://www.mapofus.org/region-of-murcia-maps/ Region of Murcia]</ref>

The second quarter [[argent]] features a military arm wielding a two-edged sword, representing Spanish power over a province.

The third quarter argent features an Aztec woman wearing a feathered skirt in shades of sinople red and green, ribbons on her forearms, and flower bouquets in each hand.

The fourth quarter gules features a crowned lion with a protruding tongue representing the ancient Kingdom of León.<ref>[https://www.worldatlas.com/flags/spain Kingdom of Leon]</ref>

The center inescutcheon features a crowned Virgin Mary dressed in [[gules]] and [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]] and the Pillars of Hercules tipped with globes. Written on the Pillars of Hercules is the motto “Plus Ultra“ reflecting overseas expansion. Charles V incorporated this symbolism with the Discovery of America.<ref>[https://fascinatingspain.com/spanish-culture-fascinating/spanish-culture-in-madrid/history-of-the-coat-of-arms-of-spain/ Shield Symbolism]</ref>

==Geography==
Villahermosa is located 30 miles (50&nbsp;km) south of the Gulf Coast and just 904&nbsp;km southeast of [[Mexico City]]. The municipality is in the center of [[Tabasco]], which adjoins the northern municipalities of Nacajuca and Centla, and the southern municipalities of [[Jalapa Municipality (Tabasco)|Jalapa]], [[Teapa (municipality)|Teapa]] and the south-central municipality of [[Macuspana]]. It also borders the northwestern state of Chiapas. The geographical coordinates of the municipality are north 18-20', south 17-43' north latitude; 92-35', west 93-15' west.

The urban area of Villahermosa occupies 61,177&nbsp;km2 while the territorial extension of the municipality occupies 1,612&nbsp;km2, which corresponds to 6.9% of the total state territory, occupying 7th place on the municipal extension scale. The territorial division of the [[Municipality of Centro (Tabasco)'s municipality of Centro]] consists of a city, 7 villas, 1 village, 132 rancheries, and 117 boroughs (colonial) and fractions. The municipality contains 13 regional development centers (CORs) where most economic and social activities are carried out, these are: [[Ocuiltzapoltán|Villa Ocuiltzapoltán]], [[Macultepec|Villa Macultepec]], [[Villa Parrilla 1a. Section]], Villa Subteniente García, [[Rosario Beaches]], Villa [[New People of Roots]], Poblado [[Dos Montes]], [[Los Boquerones]], [[Villa Luis Gil Pérez]], and Villa [[Tamulte de Las Sabanas]].

Today, Villahermosa is a modern city and one of the most important commercial points in the long stretch of territory between [[Mexico City]] and [[Cancún]]—perhaps second only to [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida]] in [[Yucatán]].

== History ==
{{See also|Timeline of Villahermosa}}
[[Image:Villahermosa.Plaza de Armas1.JPG|thumb|right|Main square in the Historic Center]]
Founded officially on 24 June 1564 by the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Diego de Quijada]] on the banks of the [[Grijalva River]] under the name of ''Villa Hermosa'', in 1826 the village was raised to the rank of [[city]] under the name of ''San Juan Bautista de la Villa Hermosa'' (Saint [[John the Baptist]]). During the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French intervention in Mexico]], French troops [[Battle of San Juan Bautista|occupied the city]] in 1863. In 1916, the governor of Tabasco, [[Francisco J. Múgica]], ordered the restoration of the city's name to ''Villahermosa''.<ref>Enciclopedia de Municipios de México, [Tabasco - Centro]</ref>

==="Colonial Age"===
The Villa Carmona was later christened San Juan Bautista, and was divided into neighborhoods. The oldest of them was the neighborhood of Esquipulas, on the ridge of the hill of Esquipulas and around the Church of Our Lord of Esquipulas, with his image of Christ black, which had been brought from [[Esquipulas|Esquipulas, Guatemala]].

By 1596 he was Mayor of Tabasco [[Lazaro Suárez de Córdova]] who continued to dispatch in [[Villa de Santa María de la Victoria|Santa Maria de la Victoria]] as the capital, and because the pirates had been attacking much the coasts of Tabasco, it commands to build in San Juan Bautista (today Villahermosa) the Fort House or Royal Warehouse. This was in order to defend the population and safeguard the flows Real. The Royal Warehouse was located in what are the current streets of Juárez, Reforma, Madero and Lerdo.{{sfn|Torruco Saravia|1987|p=31}}

On July 24, 1598, the King granted the city of San Juan Bautista the title of ''Villa Hermosa de San Juan Bautista'' as well as a royal shield (which currently identifies the state of [[Tabasco]]) and which is one of the oldest in America.

In 1604, the Mayor of Tabasco [[Juan de Miranda]] requested the Viceroy [[Juan de Mendoza and Luna]] to authorize the powers to be changed from [[Villa de Santa María de la Victoria|Santa Maria de la Victoria]] to Saint John the Baptist (now Villahermosa) in addition to requesting that the name of the city be changed to ''San Juan de Villahermosa'', authorizing the change of name of the city, not so the transfer of powers.

[[File:Portrait of Philip II of Spain by Sofonisba Anguissola - 002b.jpg|thumb|Philip II of Spain]]
The King [[Philip II of Spain]] gave the city the title of '''Villa Hermosa''' as well as a [[Coat of Tabasco's Royal Shield]].
As the pirate attacks did not cease, and they continually destroyed and ranted the village of [[Villa of Santa Maria de la Victoria|Santa María de la Victoria]], in the year 1619, the change of the powers of the province to San Juan Bautista before the Marquis de Guadalcázar Diego Fernández de Córdoba, authorizing it on December 3 of that same year. However, was re-established. The move was not made because many neighbors did not want to leave [[Villa de Santa Maria de la Victoria|Saint Mary of Victory]].{{sfn|Torruco Saravia|1987|p=34}}

===Tabasco Capital for the first time===
In 1640 due to the continuous pirate attacks on the village of [[Villa de Santa Maria de la Victoria|Santa María de la Victoria]], the authorities of the Province requested the Viceroy [[Diego López Pacheco and Portugal]] to change the capital of the Province to San Juan de Villahermosa, which the Viceroy authorized on 3 February 1641. The transfer of powers took effect on June 24 of that same year, making Villahermosa the new capital of the Province of [[Tabasco]]. The "Fortín de la Encarnación" was immediately built in what is now the park of "the birds" on the corner that form the current streets of May 5 and Zaragoza at the foot of the hill of "La Encarnación".{{sfn|Torruco Saravia|1987|p=32}}

In 1677 as Mayor [[Diego de Loyola]], the privateers fiercely attacked the capital Villahermosa de San Juan Bautista, forcing the authorities to leave the city and transfer the powers to the village of [[Tacotalpa]], which was the capital of the province for 118 years. On June 21 of that year, the Mayor of Tabasco informed the Viceroy that the fear of pirate invasions had caused the depopulation of entire villages such as Cunduacán, and that Villahermosa, which was the capital, was had depopulated too."'

In 1688, lookouts, trenches and fortifications were built in Villahermosa to protect the desolated city from pirate attacks. However, in 1711 Villahermosa was again fiercely attacked by the English pirates, who set fire to the Royal Warehouse that was the Government House, and the defenders had to take refuge in the "Fortín de la Encarnación", which withstood the attack, but the pirates burned down many houses leaving the town in ruins.

[[File:Villahermosa iglesia de la Concepción.jpg|thumb|Church of the Conception, built in 1800 in front of the [[Plaza de Armas de Villahermosa]]]]
It was until July 16, 1717, when the then Mayor of [[Tabasco]] [[Alonso Felipe Andrade]], at the head of an army of Tabasco and Veracruz forces, attacks the pirates on the Island of Tris (now the island of Carmen) that at that time belonged to [[Tabasco]] . Despite the death of [Alonso Felipe Andrade], the Tabasco forces expelled the pirates and founded that same day the military post of ''Nuesra Señora del Carmen'' (today [City of Carmen]). However, in 1757 the English pirates counterattacked the military post of Nuestra Señora del Carmen, setting it on fire and destroying it, and then re-attacking the Tabasco coasts.

Finally, in 1785, the Tabasco militias, commanded by Captain [[Juan de Amestoy]] and Lieutenant Francisco Interiano, defeated and permanently evicted the English from Carmen Island.<ref>Carlos Ruiz Abreu.

===Tabasco Capital for the second time===
In January 1795 the Viceroy [[Miguel de la Grúa Talamanca]] authorized the change of the powers of the Province of [[Tabasco]] from [[Tacotalpa]] to Villa Hermosa de San Juan Bautista, taking effect on Monday, August 15 of that year. Thus, after 118 years, Villahermosa is again the capital of Tabasco.

The neighborhood of La Punta or La Concepción was the next growth step of San Juan that transcended the first natural boundaries of the site. Developed around the church of the Immaculate Conception - "La Conchita"-, the neighborhood was also known as La Punta for being at the southern end of the city, on a hillside of the hill of La Eminence, between the Grijalva River, the lagoon of La Pólvora and the primary trace. The last district dating from the late colonial era, from the early years of the nineteenth century, was the neighborhood of La Santa Cruz, with its center in the church of the same name. This neighborhood was developed on marshy and grassland land north of the city center.

The city lived peacefully during the last years of the Colony, being an important river port.

===The Libertarian Struggle===

During the struggle for Independence, few libertarian movements aroused in the state capital, due to the fierce control exercised by the colonial authorities of the province. It was until [1814] that [José María Jiménez Garrido] launched the cry of insurrection. However, he was imprisoned by the governor and sent to [San Juan de Ulúa].

On July 5, 1821, Villahermosa was taken by the independentists headed by [[José María Jiménez Garrido]] and [[Luis Timoteo Sánchez]]{{sfn|Martínez Assad|2006|p=60}}{{Full citation needed|date=July 2024}} and at 2 p.m. in the [[Plaza de Armas de Villahermosa' Plaza Mayor]], [[Luis Timoteo Sánchez]] proclaims independence{{sfn|Abdo Francis|2011|p=83}}{{Full citation needed|date=July 2024}} and unveils the '''Glorious Independent System''.

The Civil War and the Separation of Tabasco
VT Tabasco Separation Federalist Revolution (Tabasco)
The succession of violent events began in 1833, when the civil war began in the state, between centralists and federalists with the victory of the centralists in 1834. Later in 1839, the [[Federalist Revolution (Tabasco)|Federalist Revolution]] which culminated in November 1840, with the takeover of the city and the victory of the Tabasque federalists led by the Cuban [[Francisco de Sentmanat]], the jalisciense [[Juan Pablo Anaya]] and the Tabasqueño [[Fernando Nicolás Maldonado]]. After the federalist revolution, the Texan navy that had supported [[Juan Pablo Anaya]] demanded payment for collaborating in the victory, and in the end of achieving it, began a bombardment of the city of San Juan Bautista. The bombing was halted two days later thanks to negotiations by the governor [[Pedro Requena Estrada|Pedro Requena]].
The triumph of the Tabasque federalists would annoy the president [[Anastasio Bustamante]], who on February 11, 1841, ordered heavy economic sanctions for the state, taking the State Congress and the governor [[José Víctor Jiménez]] the decision to decreeing the [[Tabasco separation]] from [[Mexico]] on 13 February 1841.{{sfn|Torruco Saravia|1987|p=71}} Granting the local Congress to the governor [[José Víctor Jiménez]] the functions of President.{{sfn|Torruco Saravia|1987|p=72}} creating two departments: the Treasury department and the War and Navy department. The various revolts and seasoned military stakes between 1833 and 1841 left the city heavily destroyed.

===U.S. Invasion===

On October 23, 1846, U.S. forces invaded [[Tabasco]], and on the 25 thresemonious day they arrived at the capital San Juan Bautista, which was defended by the Governor of the state and Military Commander [[John Baptist Traconis]], who was in command of the Tabaquean militias and the Acayucan Battalion. The commander [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]] demanded the surrender of the square, to which the governor [[John Baptist Traconis]] replied that ''the square would defend it with life, so they could initiate the attack'', the bombing was not expected, it was 14:15.{{sfn|Torruco Saravia|1987|p=83}} developed between 25 and 26 October, which is known as the [[First Battle of Tabasco]].

Due to the resilience of the city, they indiscriminately bombed Saint John the Baptist, destroying their main buildings such as neighborhood churches, public prison, theater and room houses of the three neighborhoods but due to the fierce defense of the authorities and villagers, fail to take the city. This would be the only battle won by Mexican forces over the Americans, and was achieved thanks to the expertise of Colonel [[Juan Bautista Traconis|Traconis]] and to the value of the Tobacco military volunteering, headed among others by: Miguel Bruno, Manuel Escofié, José Julián Dueñas, Juan Duque de Estrada, [Simón Sarlat García], Manuel Plascencia, and many more.{{sfn|Torruco Saravia|1987|p=85}} The Americans retreated to the port of [[Border (Tabasco)|Border]] where they set up an eight-month blockade, to prevent food and bastimento from reaching
Saint John the Baptist.

Faced with this, the governor [[John Bautista Traconis]] asked the federal government for help in the purchase of war equipment and materials, in order to protect the square from a second invasion, however, in the face of the federal government's refusal, Traconis declares Tabasco separated from the Mexican nation. However his proposal was unresonated, and Traconis was removed from the office of governor, assuming the functions [[Justo Santa Anna]].

On June 16, 1847, the Americans returned to Saint John the Baptist, staging the [Second Battle of Tabasco], in which the Americans re-bomb the city, which without bastimentos or food, falls into the hands of the invaders on June 15, having to flee the authorities to the village of [[Tacotalpa]] which is named state capital. The Americans take the city and appoint Commander Van Brunt governor of the state.

However, on July 22, the Tobacco guerrillas led by Miguel Bruno, which gave them no truce or respite, began performing in the city.{{sfn|Torruco Saravia|1987|p=87}} On the 26th arrived in Saint John the Baptist, Commander Bigelow who replaced Van Brunt in government, and tried more reinforcements to defeat the Tobacco forces. Due to the strong Tobacco guerrillas, and the reckless courage of the Tabasqueños organized by Colonel [[John Bautista Traconis]] first, and the governor [[Justo Santa Anna]] afterwards, were the causes that gave the national weapons in [Tabasco] the triumph about the Americans, on July 22, 1847.{{sfn|Torruco Saravia|1987|p=88}} Defeated, the Americans vacated the city in which they stayed for 35 days, after which they withdrew not without first setting fire and raving much of the city, leaving it completely destroyed and burned.

===French Invasion===
[[File:Villahermosa Monumento a Sánchez Magallanes 1.jpg|thumb|[[Monumento a Andrés Sánchez Magallanes]], which honors the victory against the French army]]
Also, in 1863 and 1864, both French interventionist forces and Mexican pro-imperialist forces again destroyed much of the buildings of San Juan. On 18 June 1863, the French army under the command of Eduardo González Arévalo, dawned before the capital of the state San Juan Bautista, initiating a heavy bombardment and landing with 150 men.{{sfn|Torruco Saravia|1987|p=100}} A line of defense was established from the square of ''Ruiz'' to the stream ''El Jícaro'', the bombardment was so intense that forced the retreat of the defenders to the outskirts of the city, taking control of the invaders of the city and establishing its barracks in the building called "The Principal" which had been the Royal Warehouse during the Colony. From the capital, the French invaders would begin the struggle to control the entire state of Tabasco. However, the Tobacco forces would gradually go back to the ground.

Six months later, on December 2, 1863, the Tabasque Republican forces under Colonel [[Gregorio Méndez Magaña]] begin bombing the city of San Juan Bautista.{{sfn|Torruco Saravia|1987|p=102}} The prelude to the final assault began with the harassment of the capital, and was attacked from different flanks by [[Juan Morales (soldier)|Juan Morales]], [[Lino Merino]], [[Narciso Sáenz]], and [[Pedro Fuentes (soldier)|Pedro Fuentes]] who by the end of 1863 had closed the fence over the state capital.{{sfn|Torruco Saravia|1987|p=242}}

The final assault on the capital began on 13 January 1864,{{sfn|Arias Gómez|1987|p=242}}{{Full citation needed|date=July 2024}} and as the enemy became closer, various battles and skirmishes took place, in what is known as the [Saint John the Baptist's Take] in a street-by-street fight. Republican forces gradually gained ground and by January 18 were in the center of the capital, causing French troops to retreat, entrenching themselves in the Royal Warehouse known as "The Principal".
It was fought until February 25, when the ''Strong House'' or ''The Principal'' began to gun down, and on February 27, when the dawn broke, the French invaders undertook the retreat leaving the state capital,{{sfn|Torruco Saravia|1987|p=102}} this glorious date for national weapons since this was the first region from which the French invaders were expelled from the national territory. Churches and buildings rebuilt after the French bombing had to be rebuilt after this new aggression.

===Twentieth and twenty-first centuries===
====Mexican Revolution in Tabasco====
The 1890s and 1900s witnessed the first notable expansions of this colonial city. However, during the [Mexican Revolution in Tabasco', the political and social instability that characterized Mexico, was also reflected in the state capital, where in that period, there were 13 governors and in 1918 there were two governors and two state congresses at the same time. On June 28, 1911, he made his triumphant entrance to Saint John the Baptist, the revolutionary contingent of the Chontalpa under [[Sunday C. Magaña]].

During the Revolution, on August 28, 1914 [[Luis Felipe Domínguez]] at the head of the ''Usumacinta Brigade'', he entered the capital San Juan Bautista, taking office of the government on 31 August, which stunned the struggle between the defatuent factions Revolutionary. on September 2, the generals [[Carlos Greene]], [[Pedro C. Colorado]], [Ramón Sosa Torres], [[Isidro Cortés]] and [José Domingo Ramírez Garrido], entered the state capital, with the arrival of the chontalpa revolutionaries, there were suffoals and terrors in the city. The general [[Carlos Greene]] took office in government, however, the Donetists attacked the state capital, causing the authorities to leave Saint John the Baptist because they protested for "electoral fraud" formed their Congress and settled in Amatitan, recognizing Luis Felipe Domínguez as constitutional governor and brought before the Senate of the Republic, a case of conflict of powers, since there are two governors and two Congresses at the same time. In 1919 [[Carlos Greene]] with the help of [Tomás Garrido Canabal" Tomás Garrido] defeats the Donetists and will recapture the state capital.

He had just finished the revolutionary movement, then there was a strong and transcendent re-arrangement of the socio-political and reorganization classes of the Mexican state. The war known as "Christian" spread throughout the country, and in [Tabasco] it had its own manifestations. By government decree of February 3, 1916, the city was renamed "Villahermosa", stating that the name should be written together and not separated as it was in place.

====Delahuertista rebellion in Tabasco====
In 1923 the general [[Adolfo de la Huerta]] protested against the imposition of the presidential candidacy of [Plutarco Elías Calles], which caused the landowners to rise up in arms in various parts of the country. In Tabasco, in mid-December the homeless men rose in arms in the port of [[Frontera (Tabasco)' Frontera]] against the governor [[Tomás Garrido Canabal]] and [[Alvaro Obregón]], while the general [[Carlos Greene]] joined the movement, rising in arms in the Chontalpa.

On January 10, 1924, at the head of 2,500 men, the generals [[Carlos Greene]] and Fernando Segovia besieged and took Villahermosa the capital of the state, without being contained by forces loyal to the President [[Alvaro Obreg'ón) Obregón]], commanded by Generals Vicente González and Miguel Henríquez Guzmán,{{sfn|Martínez Assad|2006|p=164}}{{Full citation needed|date=July 2024}} leading to the escape of the governor [[Tomás Garrido Canabal]], who had to hide for a few days and then left the city at night in a cayuco. The delahuertists appointed as governor [[Manuel Antonio Romero]] who occupied the governorship from January 21 to June 7, 1924, when the rebellion ended when the state was attacked by federal forces and defeated the deserters.{{sfn|Martínez Assad|2006|p=166}}{{Full citation needed|date=July 2024}}

====Garridism====
This time began in 1928 with the arrival of [[Tomás Garrido Canabal]] in the state government. Several times Governor of Tabasco, he created the organization "red shirts" which, in addition to his political activity of support, deployed a paramilitary battle against the Catholic Church in the state.
As authority he expelled the bishop, the priests and decreed several prohibitions concerning worship, religious feasts, Catholic funeral rites, including domestic worship and even the mere mention of God. He closed the temples and gave them a new use, turning them into "rationalist" schools, military barracks or libraries. Later, the temples, the center of the old quarters, were demolished. The images were burned, but the Christians hid several of them in the "mountain", including the black Christ of Esquipulas and also the image of the Virgin Mary brought by [[Hernán Cortés' Courtesy]]. Life linked to worship and other religious celebrations virtually disappeared in Garrido's years of authority, whose influence he left feeling even after his last governorship in 1934.

====Contemporary Era====
In the 1940s and 1950s, the expansion of Villahermosa was made up of developments by state governments and landowners who prepared and fractionated land that had previously had agricultural, grassland or grassland use forest, thus creating the first boroughs (colonial). On the other hand, the installation of drains, stormwater ducts, etc. began to change also the physiognomy of some old streets.
Juan Perez Arrollave Infantry Lieutenant who participated in the Mexican Revolution was as municipal president from 1946 to 1950, a personal friend of Plutarco Elias Calles

The old Saint John the Baptist now became the "center" of a larger city. The babbling of a new urban phenomenon began to manifest itself: metropolization.

When Tabasco entered the "age of capital", that is, it fully integrated into the country's economic development through oil exploitation and the construction of road, hydro-agricultural and hydroelectric infrastructure in the 1950s-1960s, Villahermosa began an important commercial development, towns such as Tamulté, Atasta, and Tierra Colorada became populous boroughs (colonias) of the new city.

By 1970, Villahermosa was considered a modern city due to its architectural dynamism that began in the last century, when the state of [[Tabasco]] became one of the main oil regions of the country, which changed the urban geography of Villahermosa.

Buildings and large recreation centers changed the physiognomy of the state capital, being the area called Tabasco 2000, the main area of progress, the best example of the rejuvenated city. 
In Tabasco 2000 reside the Municipal Powers, the Administrative Center of Government, office buildings, banks, hotels, restaurants, shopping squares, and residential areas.

VT Villahermosa's Old Town
[[File:Villahermosa Paseo Tabasco.jpg|thumb|Avenida "Paseo Tabasco", the most emblematic of the city]]

Despite being a very old city, Villahermosa has a modern physiognomy. The [[historic center of Villahermosa'old town]] guards the old colonial center of the city. It is an area of approximately 143 hectares<ref>Guide to the Historic Center of Villahermosa. National Institute of Anthropology and History. 2001</ref> containing the oldest buildings in the city, including the first painting where the [[Plaza de Armas de Villahermosa' is located Plaza de Armas]] or Main Park, where the [[Tabasco Government Palace]] is located; Government Palace, the headquarters of the executive branch of the State; the Legislative Palace, the headquarters of the H. Congress of the State; the High Court of Justice, the headquarters of the Judiciary, and the Church of the Conception, opened on 8 December 1800 but destroyed by the American bombing sprees in 1846 and 1847 and by the French in 1863 and 1864.{{sfn|Torruco Saravia|1987|p=47}} There are other buildings of historical value in the area, such as the House of Tiles (now the Museum of History), the ancient Juarez Institute (now house of culture of the [[UJAT]]), the museum house of the poet [[Carlos Pellicer Camera]] and others buildings that are now art galleries or businesses.

The heart of the [[Historic Center of Villahermosa's historic center]] is the so-called ''Light Zone''', formed by Juarez, Lerdo, Aldama, and Sáenz streets, Reforma, which are the oldest in the city and which have been transformed into pedestrian streets, where there are cafes, restaurants, neverías, clothing stores, etc., and they constitute the commercial heart of the city. Also within the [[Historic Center of Villahermosa's old town]] are located the Park of the Corregidora, the Juarez Park, the Square of the Eagle and the Square Bicentennial, with a metallic [[obelísco]] of 30 meters high.

Outside the historic center, the city features modern architecture. Its rapid development since the 1970s caused it to overflow into areas that were formerly formed by lagoons, grasslands and swamps, and to absorb other communities, such as [[Atasta]], [[Tamulté]] and [[Red Land]], now populous boroughs (colonias).
Its most important roads that link the city of Villahermosa between different points are:
Av.[[Tabasco Walk]]: from the Gaviotas Bridge to the Peripheral Arco Noreste, crossing sites such as the Main Cemetery, the [[Cathedral of the Lord of Tabasco]], crosses the [[Laguna de las Ilusions]], the tourist complex [[Tabasco 2000]], [[Gregorio[Gregorio Mendez Magaña Av. Gregorio Mendez]], [[27 February] Av. 27 De Febrero]], Av. [[Paseo Usumacinta]], [Av. Francisco J.

Tall and modern office buildings, they account for the important economic development of the city.

To the north is the Industrial City with its two stages, and housing areas of social interest and middle class. To the south, the mountains and higher areas have led to the proliferation of shopping centers and housing and residential developments.

Over the past 10 years, the lack of suitable land for the construction of housing and the new reordering that prohibits construction in low and flood areas of the city, has led to the growth of housing developments to the outskirts of the city, promoting the growth of the urban spot towards nearby towns, now integrated into the so-called [[Metropolitan Area of Villahermosa]], promoting the development of populations such as Villa Parrilla, Macultepec, Ocuiltzapotlán, Playas del Rosario, Río Viejo, Buenavista, Ixtacomitán and Boquerón where most housing fractions currently take place.
