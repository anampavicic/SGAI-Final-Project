The city was formerly known as Attalia and was founded in around 200 BC by King [[Attalus II Philadelphus|Attalus II]] of [[Pergamon]]. Attalia was soon conquered by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. Roman rule saw the city thrive, including the construction of several new monuments, such as [[Hadrian's Gate]], and the flourishing of nearby ancient cities such as [[Patara (Lycia)|Patara]], [[Xanthos]] and [[Myra]] in the [[Lycia]] region; [[Perga]], [[Aspendos]] and [[Side, Turkey|Side]] in [[Pamphylia]]; and [[Sagalassos]], [[Antioch of Pisidia|Antioch]] and [[Termessos]] in [[Pisidia]]. These cities were already significant centers before Roman influence. Antalya has changed hands several times, including to the [[Seljuk Empire]] in 1207 and an expanding [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1391.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.ucuyos.com/ucak-bileti/antalya-trabzon/|title = History of Antalya|publisher = Lonely Planet}}</ref> Ottoman rule brought relative peace and stability for the next five hundred years. The city was [[Italian occupation of Adalia|occupied by Italy]] for three years in the aftermath of [[World War I]], but was recaptured by a newly independent Turkey in the [[Turkish War of Independence]].

While the city itself only has modest elevation changes, Antalya has high mountains in all directions to its interior. With moisture being trapped, the [[#Climate|local climate]] thus has high winter rainfall, while the interior bay setting result in very hot summers for a coastal city.

The city is Turkey's biggest international sea resort on the Turkish Riviera. Large-scale development and governmental funding has made it a prime destination for tourists. Antalya is currently the [[List of cities by international visitors|fourth-most visited city]] in the world, trailing behind only [[Istanbul]], [[London]], and [[Dubai]], attracting more than 16.5 million foreign visitors in 2023.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Popova |first1=Nadejda |title=2023‚Äôs Top 100 City Destinations Ranking: Triumphs and Turmoil Uncovered |url=https://www.euromonitor.com/article/2023s-top-100-city-destinations-ranking-triumphs-and-turmoil-uncovered |publisher=[[Euromonitor International]] |access-date=18 December 2023 |date=11 December 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240206-most-visited-cities-in-the-world-istanbul-antalya-turkey-travel-visa-requirements |title=Two of the most-visited cities in the world are in Turkey - this one is the unsung hero |last=Leasca |first=Stacey |date=6 February 2024 |website=BBC |access-date=27 March 2024 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240226163739/https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240206-most-visited-cities-in-the-world-istanbul-antalya-turkey-travel-visa-requirements |archive-date=26 February 2024}}</ref>

King [[Attalus II Philadelphus|Attalus II]] of [[Pergamon]] is looked on as founder of the city in about 150 BC, during the [[Hellenistic period]]. It was named '''Attaleia''' or '''Attalia''' ({{langx|grc|·ºàœÑœÑŒ¨ŒªŒµŒπŒ±}})<ref>{{cite web|url=https://topostext.org/work/241#A144.4|title=A144.4 Attaleia|website=Topostext.org|access-date=5 March 2022}}</ref> in his honour. The city served as a naval base for Attalus's powerful fleet. Excavations in 2008, in the [[Doƒüu Garajƒ±]] plot, uncovered remains dating to the 3rd century BC, suggesting that Attalea was a rebuilding and expansion of an earlier town.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

[[File:II. Attalos Heykeli.JPG|thumb|Statue of [[Attalus II]] in the city]]
Attalea became part of the [[Roman Empire]] in 133 BC when [[Attalus III]], a nephew of Attalus II, bequeathed his kingdom to Rome at his death in 133 BC. The city grew and prospered during the [[Ancient Roman]] period and was part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Pamphylia Secunda]], whose capital was [[Perga]].
Christianity started to spread to the region even in the 1st century: Attalea was visited by [[Paul of Tarsus]] and [[Barnabas]], as recorded in the [[Acts of the Apostles]]: "Then they passed through [[Pisidia]] and came to [[Pamphylia]]. And when they had spoken the word in [[Perga]], they went down to Attalea, and from there they sailed to [[Antioch]]".<ref>{{bibleverse||Acts|14:25‚Äì26|ESV}}</ref> Some of the bishops attributed to the [[episcopal see]] of Attalea in Pamphylia may instead have been bishops of [[Attalea in Lydia]] (Yanantepe), since [[Le Quien]] lists them under both sees.<ref>{{Oriens christianus|volume=1|at= coll. 1027‚Äì1028 ‚Äì compare with coll. 885‚Äì888}}</ref><ref>M.

The 13th-century [[Seljuks|Seljuk]] mosque at Attalea, now in ruins, had been a Christian [[Byzantine]] basilica from the 7th century.{{cn|date=July 2024}} The Great Mosque had also been a Christian basilica and the Kesik Minare Mosque had been the 5th-century Christian Church of the Panaghia or Virgin and was decorated with finely carved marble.{{cn|date=July 2024}} The archaeological museum at Attalea houses some sarcophagi and mosaics from nearby Perga and a casket of bones reputed to be those of [[St. Nicholas]], the bishop of [[Myra]], further down the Turquoise coast. The area of Antalya was subject to naval attacks by the [[Arabs]] of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]].{{cn|date=July 2024}}

Attalea was a major city in the [[Byzantine Empire]]. It was the capital of the [[Theme (country subdivision)#Establishment|Byzantine Theme]] of the [[Cibyrrhaeots]], which occupied the southern coasts of [[Anatolia]]. According to the research of Speros Vryonis, it was the major naval station on the southern Anatolian coast, a major commercial center, and the most convenient harbor between the [[Aegean Sea]] and Cyprus and points further east. Besides the local merchants, "one could expect to see Armenians, Saracens, Jews, and Italians."<ref>Vryonis, ''The decline of medieval Hellenism in Asia Minor: and the process of Islamization from the eleventh through the fifteenth century'', (Berkeley: University of California, 1971), pp. 13f</ref>

At the time of the accession of [[John II Komnenos]] in 1118, Attalea was an isolated outpost surrounded by Turkish beyliks, accessible only by sea,<ref>Norwich, John Julius. ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall.'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1996) p. 68.</ref> but his [[Siege of Sozopolis|capture of Sozopolis]] in 1120 re-opened land-communication with the city once more. Following the [[Sack of Constantinople]] by the [[Crusaders]] in 1204, [[Niketas Choniates]] records that Attalea was the personal fiefdom of a certain Aldebrandus, "an Italian by birth who was strictly raised according to Roman tradition". When [[Kaykhusraw I|Kaykhusraw]], sultan of the [[Seljuk Turks]] attempted to capture the city in 1206, Aldebrandus called [[Cyprus]] for help and received 200 infantry from the Latins. The attackers were defeated after a siege of less than 16 days.<ref>''O City of Byzantium: Annals of Niketas Choniates'', translated by Harry J. Magoulias (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1984), p. 351</ref> Kaykhusraw would take Attalea the following year and build its first mosque.<ref>''Islam and Christianity in Medieval Anatolia'', ed.

Crane, ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'', Vol. 36, No. 1  (1993), 6.</ref> Christians rebelled and captured Attalea with aid of [[Walter of Montb√©liard]] in 1212. Briefly restored [[Byzantine]] rule in Attalea was ended by [[Kaykaus I]] in 1216.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sabah.com.tr/akdeniz/2012/12/16/selcuklular-devrinde-antalya|title=Sel√ßuklular devrinde Antalya|website=Sabah.com.tr|access-date=5 March 2022}}</ref>

The city and the surrounding region were conquered by the [[Seljuk Turks]] in the early 13th century. Attalea was the capital of the Turkish [[beylik of Teke]] (1321‚Äì1423) until its conquest by the Ottomans, except for a period of [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cypriot]] rule between 1361 and 1373. The [[Arab]] traveller [[Ibn Battuta]], who visited the city in 1335‚Äì1340, noted:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/halsall/sbook.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks|website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu|access-date=21 October 2016}}</ref>

{{quote|sign=|source=|From Alanya I went to Antaliya [Adalia], a most beautiful city. It covers an immense area, and though of vast bulk is one of the most attractive towns to be seen anywhere, besides being exceedingly populous and well laid out. Each section of the inhabitants lives in a separate quarter. The Christian merchants live in a quarter of the town known as the Mina [the Port], and are surrounded by a wall, the gates of which are shut upon them from without at night and during the Friday service. The Greeks, who were its former inhabitants, live by themselves in another quarter, the [[Jews]] in another, and the king and his court and Mamluks in another, each of these quarters being walled off likewise. The rest of the Muslims live in the main city. Round the whole town and all the quarters mentioned there is another great wall. The town contains orchards and produces fine fruits, including an admirable kind of apricot, called by them Qamar ad-Din, which has a sweet almond in its kernel. This fruit is dried and exported to Egypt, where it is regarded as a great luxury.}}

In the second half of the 17th century [[Evliya √áelebi]] wrote of a city of narrow streets containing 3,000 houses in 20 [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and four [[Greeks|Greek]] neighborhoods.{{cn|date=July 2024}} The town had grown beyond the city walls and the port was reported to hold up to 200 boats.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

In the 19th century, in common with most of Anatolia, its sovereign was a "dere [[bey]]" (landlord or landowner). The family of Tekke Oƒülu, domiciled near [[Perge]] had been reduced to submission in 1812 by [[Mahmud II]], but continued to be a rival power to the Ottoman governor until the early 20th century, surviving by many years the fall of the other great beys of Anatolia. The records of the Levant (Turkey) Company, which maintained an agency in Antalya until 1825, documented the local dere beys.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Adalia|volume=1|page=167|first=David George|last=Hogarth|author-link=David George Hogarth}}</ref>

In the early 20th century, Antalya had two factories spinning and weaving [[cotton]]. As of 1920, the factories had 15,000 [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]]s and over 200 [[loom]]s. A [[German people|German]]-owned [[Cotton mill|mill]] baled cotton. There were [[gin mill]]s.<ref name=Prothero113>{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Anatolia|year=1920|publisher=H.M.

In the 20th century, the population of Antalya increased as Muslim refugees from the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Balkans]] moved into Anatolia. The economy was centered on its port that served the inland areas, particularly Konya. Antalya (then Adalia) was picturesque rather than modern. The chief attraction for visitors was the city wall, and outside a promenade, a portion of which survives. The government offices and the houses of the higher classes were outside the walls.<ref name="EB1911"/>
[[File:Kalei√ßi_g√∂r√ºn√ºm√º_(5).JPG|thumb|The Ottoman houses in Kalei√ßi]]
As of 1920, Antalya was reported as having a population of approximately 30,000. The harbor was described as small, and unsafe for vessels to visit in the winter. Antalya was exporting wheat, flour, [[sesame seed]]s, livestock, timber and charcoal. The latter two were often exported to [[Egypt]] and other goods to Italy or other Greek islands, who received mainly flour. In 1920, the city had seven [[flour mill]]s. Wheat was imported, and then processed in town before exportation. Antalya imported manufactured items, mainly from the United Kingdom.<ref name=Prothero81>{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Anatolia|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11766/view/1/81/}}</ref> The city had a Greek minority that made up 1/3 of the population until the population exchange. Antalya also had a tiny Armenian population which had a church on the street of "Hamam √ßikmazi" named Hovhannes Surp Garabed, which was later on demolished. Antalya also had a Jewish community which had a tiny Synagogue in the neighborhood of Balbey and a Talmud Torah. The Synagogue was closed in 1948 and its exact location is not known, and the Synagogue might not exist anymore. The Jewish community had 2 graveyards and one was located across "Donerciler carsisi"and was demolished when the area was opened to construction, but one marble tombstone belonging to a Jew named Raphael Moshe was transferred to the [[Antalya Museum]] where it can be seen in the museum garden.

The city was [[Italian occupation of Adalia|occupied by Italy]] for three years (1919-22) in the aftermath of [[World War I]], but was recaptured by a newly independent Turkey in the [[Turkish War of Independence]].{{cn|date=July 2024}} Large-scale development beginning in the 1970s transformed Antalya from a pastoral town into one of Turkey's largest metropolitan areas.{{cn|date=July 2024}} Much of this has been due to tourism, which expanded in the 21st century. In the 1987 singing diva [[Dalida]] held her last concert in Antalya.

Antalya was the host city for the [[2015 G-20 Antalya summit|2015 G-20 summit]] and the [[Expo 2016|EXPO 2016]]. Five countries have their consular missions in Antalya including Belgium, Germany, Russia, Serbia and the United Kingdom.<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://www.mfa.gov.tr/sirbistan-antalya-fahri-konsoloslugu-acilisi.tr.mfa|title =Serbian Consolate in Antalya|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20180820172604/http://www.mfa.gov.tr/sirbistan-antalya-fahri-konsoloslugu-acilisi.tr.mfa|archive-date =20 August 2018|url-status =dead|df =dmy-all}}</ref>

Antalya has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification system|K√∂ppen]]: ''Csa'') or a dry-summer [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Cf'' or ''<nowiki/>'wet Cs'''). It experiences hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. While rainy spells are common and often heavy in winter, Antalya is very sunny, with nearly 3,000 hours of sunlight per year. Frost does occasionally occur at night almost every winter, but snow is a very rare phenomenon. The highest recorded air temperature was {{convert|45.4|C}} on 1 July 2017 but later this record was removed and turned back to 45¬∞C (113¬∞F) in 6 July 2000. Record low is -4.6¬∞C (23.7¬∞F) in 5 February 1950. Record snow depth is 5 cm (1.97 inches) in January 1993. The mean sea temperature ranges between {{convert|16|C}} in winter and {{convert|27|C}} in summer.<ref name="Weather2Travel">{{cite web|title=Antalya Climate and Weather Averages, Antalya Coast|url=http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/turkey/antalya-coast/antalya.php|access-date=23 August 2013|publisher=Weather2Travel}}</ref>

[[File:Antalya Atat√ºrk M√ºzesi (cropped).jpg|thumb|An old building of [[Atat√ºrk's House Museum (Antalya)]]]]
The mayor of the Antalya Metropolitan Municipality is [[Muhittin B√∂cek]] of the CHP, in office since 2019. For general elections, Antalya elects 18 Members of Parliament to the Turkish [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Grand National Assembly]].

===Elections===
Antalya has traditionally been seen as a stronghold for the [[Kemalist]] centre-left party [[Republican People's Party]] (CHP). Being the capital of the fifth most populous province in Turkey, Antalya is politically strategic and has been a target for the governing right-wing [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP). The AKP unexpectedly won control of the Antalya Metropolitan Municipality in the [[2004 Turkish local elections|2004 local election]]. The AKP won a plurality in Antalya in the [[2007 Turkish general election|2007 general election]], symbolising the city's political transformation from a CHP stronghold to a CHP-AKP marginal battleground in the 21st century. The loss of Antalya was a major political setback for the CHP not only because of its significance as a centre for tourism, but also because the CHP's former leader [[Deniz Baykal]] is a [[Member of Parliament]] for the province. The province is divided into 19 districts.

The CHP regained control of the Metropolitan Municipality in the [[2009 Turkish local elections|2009 local elections]], though the AKP won a plurality in the [[2011 Turkish general election|2011 general election]]. The [[Nationalist Movement Party]] (MHP) also have a strong political base in Antalya, winning approximately between 15 and 25% of the vote in elections since 2007. The city voted in favour of the AKP government's proposed constitutional reforms in the [[2007 Turkish constitutional referendum|2007 referendum]], but [[2010 Turkish constitutional referendum|voted against]] the reforms proposed in 2010.

In the [[2014 Turkish local elections|2014 local elections]], Antalya once again voted for the AKP, with the MHP taking support away from the CHP by winning a record 24.3% of the vote. The CHP subsequently accused the AKP of systematic electoral fraud, and the presence of government minister [[Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu]] at one of the vote counting centres drew strong condemnation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/national_serious-election-fraud-allegations-recounts-continue_343677.html|title=Serious election fraud allegations, recounts continue|work=TodaysZaman|access-date=10 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://chpbxl.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/biggest-electoral-fraud-ever-staged-in-turkey-4-april-2014.pdf|title=Biggest Electoral Fraud Ever Staged In Turkey|website=Chpbxl.files.wordpress.com|access-date=5 March 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.veooz.com/photos/AH2iy8u.html|title=[Photo] Electoral fraud ‚Äì Turkish local election ... ‚Äì Veooz 360|work=Veooz|access-date=10 August 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20141029132803/http://www.veooz.com/photos/AH2iy8u.html|archive-date=29 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/sections/politics/2014/04/03/turkey-allegations-of-election-fraud-yalova-goes-to-chp_1f918b1e-ceaf-4040-904a-6991c1c25c9a.html|title=Turkey: allegations of election fraud, Yalova goes to CHP ‚Äì Politics ‚Äì ANSAMed.it|date=3 April 2014 |access-date=10 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sozcu.com.tr/2014/gundem/ab-bakani-mevlut-cavusoglu-oy-sayarken-480201/|title=AB Bakanƒ± Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu oy sayarken|date=2 April 2014|access-date=10 August 2015}}</ref> In the [[2014 Turkish presidential election|2014 presidential election]], the CHP and MHP's joint candidate [[Ekmeleddin ƒ∞hsanoƒülu]] won 53.08% of the vote.

== Transportation ==
<!---names seem to be a distraction to the article here. Doesn't seem to have a lot to do with Antalya-->
[[File:Antalya_Strassenbahn.JPG|thumb|Antalya Nostalgic Trams]]

The main transportation to the city is by air and land. Sea routes are still under development.
In 2007, the airport added a new terminal.

The city has a main port at the south of the Konyaaltƒ±.

=== Buses ===
There is a network of look-alike [[Dolmu≈ü]]es that are privately owned and operated [[minibus]]es, under municipal government control.

Antalya Ula≈üƒ±m, a municipally-owned corporation, runs the public bus system. The corporation owns Antobus and Antray. Antobus was started in September 2010. In 2010, the city planned to increase from 40 to 140 more buses.<ref>{{cite web

Payment for public transportation was made in cash until the launch of a public transportation card, ''Antkart'', in late 2007. The card system met with criticism and was subsequently canceled in June 2009, returning to a cash system. ''Halkkart'' has been used for the transportation system since the summer of 2010. ''Halkkart'' is managed by A-Kent Smart City Technologies under the control of Antalya Metropolitan Municipal government. Passengers can use identified cards to take buses or trams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antalya.bel.tr |title=Antalya B√ºy√ºk≈üehir Belediyesi |publisher=Antalya.bel.tr |date=23 May 2014 |access-date=24 June 2014}}</ref>
