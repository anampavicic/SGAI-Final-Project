==History==
{{main|Nandgaon State}}
Originally known as Nandgram, [[Nandgaon State|Rajnandgaon State]] was ruled by [[Lunar dynasty|Somvanshi]]s, [[Kalachuris of Tripuri]] and [[Maratha]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rajnandgaon.gov.in |title=Official Website of District Rajnandgaon}}</ref> The palaces in the town of Rajnandgaon reveal their own tale of the rulers, their society and culture, and the traditions of those times.<ref name="rajnand"/>

The city was ruled by a dynasty of Hindu caretakers ([[Bairagi (caste)|Bairagis]]), who bore the title '''Vaishnav''' and Gond rajas (chiefs). Succession was by adoption. Its foundation is traced to a religious celibate who came from the Punjab towards the end of the 18th century. From the founder it passed through a succession of chosen disciples until 1879, when the British government recognized the ruler as an hereditary chief and it came to be known as [[princely state]] of Raj Nandgaon. Afterwards conferred upon his son the title of Raja Bahadur. The first ruler [[Mahant Raja Ghasi Das|Mahant Ghasi Das]] was recognized as a feudal chief by the British government in 1865 and was granted a [[sanad of adoption]]. Later the British conferred the title of raja on the ruling mahant.<ref name=history1>{{cite book|title=Chhattisgarh ki Riyaste/Princely stastes aur Jamindariyaa|publisher=Vaibhav Prakashan|location=Raipur|isbn=81-89244-96-5}}</ref><ref name=history2>{{cite book|title=Chhattisgarh ki Janjaatiyaa/Tribes aur Jatiyaa/Castes|publisher=Mansi publication|location=Delhi|isbn=978-81-89559-32-8}}</ref>
