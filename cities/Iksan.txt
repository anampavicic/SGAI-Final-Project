'''Iksan''' ({{langx|ko|익산}}; {{IPA|ko|ik̚.s͈an}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] and major railway junction in [[North Jeolla Province]], South Korea.

The city center and railway junction was formerly called "Iri" ({{korean|rr=Iri-si|hangul=이리시|hanja=裡里市}}), but merged with Iksan County (''Iksan-gun'') in 1995.

The railway junction is located at the point where [[Jeolla Line|Jeolla]] and [[Janghang Line|Janghang]]s meet the [[Honam Line]] and the [[Honam high-speed railway|Honam HSR]] and is served by frequent train service to/from [[Seoul]], [[Daejeon]], [[Gwangju]], [[Mokpo]], [[Jeonju]], [[Suncheon, South Korea|Suncheon]], and [[Yeosu]].

[[Jeonbuk National University]] Iksan campus (before, it was Iksan National College), the [[Won Buddhism Graduate School]], [[Wonkwang Health Science College]], and [[Wonkwang University]] are all located in Iksan.

This city is called “The City of Jewelry". The [[Iksan Jewelry Museum]] opened in May 2002 next to a Dinosaur museum.

In late November 2006, Korean authorities quarantined a farm in Iksan and began culling poultry and livestock within a 3-kilometer radius to contain an outbreak of the H5N1 [[H5N1|bird flu]] virus.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/Engnews/20061126/620000000020061126120016E6.html |title = Yonhap News |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070430062706/http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/Engnews/20061126/620000000020061126120016E6.html |archive-date=30 April 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Local tradition includes the story of Seodong and Seonhwa, which was broadcast in 2005~2006 as "Sedongyo" and is also dramatized in the 'Paradise in Autumn Festival.'

Festivals with various themes are held in Iksan, all reflecting local history and culture. These include:

* 10,000,000 Chrysanthemum Festival (held in October/November) 
* Iksan Jewelry Expo 
* Seodong Festival 
* Stone Culture Festival

Anthem: Song of Citizens of Iksan

==History==
Iksan was once the capital of the ancient [[Baekje]] Kingdom. Temples built then are still standing. Iksan has always been an important transport center. After the [[Iri station explosion|Iri train station explosion]] in 1977, Iksan fell into a state of decline. However, the city's train station was later rebuilt, and it became the junction of three rail lines named above. It now services [[KTX]] and  Saemaul trains as well as frequent bus lines. Today, Iksan is once again a thriving city.

==Geography==
[[File:Iksan City 76 (17043094408).jpg|left|thumb|[[Mireuksaji Stone Pagoda]]]]
Iksan is situated on the Okgu and Keumman Plains, which lead to the West Sea [Yellow Sea]. As it is located very near the sea where ships can transport a wide variety of products, Iksan has served as a logistical and traffic center for a long time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iksan.go.kr/02en/ |title=Welcome to Iksan City Hall |access-date=2008-11-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102204742/http://www.iksan.go.kr/02en/ |archive-date=2008-11-02 }} Iksan Official English Website</ref>

The city is in the northwestern part of Jeollabuk-do. East are the rugged mountains of Mt. Cheonho and Mt. Mireuk ([[Mireuksan (Jeollabuk-do)]]) at the edge of the Noryeong Mountains, and northwest the range of Mt. Hamra lead to a series of hills and a great stream that has formed the fertile Okgu plain to the west. Iksan borders Nonsan-gun and Buyeo-gun, Chuncheongnam-do, and is divided by the Keum-gang[river] in the north. It faces the Kimje Plains, divided by Mankyeong-gang, to the south.
