'''San Luis Río Colorado''' is a city and also the name of its [[San Luis Río Colorado (municipality)|surrounding municipality]] in the [[List of states of Mexico|state]] of [[Sonora]], [[Mexico]]. In the 2020 census, the city had a population of 176,685.<ref name="population"/> The city is the fourth-largest community in the state, and the municipality is also the fourth-largest in terms of population. Lying in the northwestern corner of Sonora, the city marks the state border with [[Baja California]].

The municipality covers an area of 8,412.75&nbsp;km² (3,248.2 sq mi) in the [[Sonoran Desert]].

== History ==
Before Spanish colonization, the area now known as San Luis Río Colorado was inhabited by the indigenous people of [[Halyikwamai]] who lived in the San Luis Río Colorado region until the mid-19th century, merging with the [[Maricopa tribe]].<ref>{{cite journal|first=Naomi|last=Sussman|title=Indigenous Diplomacy and Spanish Mediation in the Lower Colorado-Gila River Region, 1771–1783|journal=Ethnohistory|volume=66|issue=2|date=April 2019|pages=329–352|doi=10.1215/00141801-7298819|s2cid=167018422 }}</ref>

San Luis Río Colorado was once an important inland port for steamers traveling the [[Colorado River|Colorado]] from the [[Gulf of California]]. Since the early 1900s the Colorado has been completely or nearly completely drained for irrigation. The once-formidable Colorado is usually dry or a small stream.

Awarded city status in July 1958, San Luis Río Colorado serves as the administrative center for the surrounding municipality of the same name.  The city is located on a mesa, characterized by a flat and sandy terrain.

On Easter Sunday 2010, a [[2010 Baja California earthquake|7.2 magnitude earthquake]] struck the region. The [[Sears (Mexico)|Sears]] department store (formerly [[Dorian's]]) and 5 schools were destroyed, affecting approximately 30,000 people in the region.

San Luis Río Colorado is home to four regional medium-wave radio broadcast stations, among them 1350 XELBL-AM, all of which are popular long-distance reception targets for medium-wave DX radio enthusiasts.

Josse, a Mexican Latin beat singer recorded a song called "San Luis Río Colorado" as a tribute to the river.
