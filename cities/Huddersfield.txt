'''Huddersfield''' is a [[town]] in the [[Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees]] in [[West Yorkshire]], England. It is the administrative centre and largest settlement in the Kirklees district. The town is in the foothills of the [[Pennines]]. The [[River Holme]]'s confluence into the similar-sized [[River Colne, West Yorkshire|Colne]] is to the south of the town centre which then flows into the [[River Calder, West Yorkshire|Calder]] in the north eastern outskirts of the town.

The rivers around the town provided soft water required for textile treatment in large [[weaving shed]]s; this made it a prominent [[mill town]] with an economic boom in the early part of the Victorian era [[Industrial Revolution]]. The town centre has much neoclassical [[Victorian architecture]]. An example is {{rws|Huddersfield||its railway station}}, which is a Grade I [[listed building]] described by [[John Betjeman]] as "the most splendid station façade in England".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/local-west-yorkshire-news/2009/10/23/st-george-s-square-finally-finished-4m-and-550-days-later-86081-24995826/ |title=St George's Square finally finished – £4m and 550 days later |newspaper=The Huddersfield Daily Examiner|date=23 October 2009|access-date=6 April 2013}}</ref> It won the [[Europa Nostra]] award for architecture.

Huddersfield hosts the [[University of Huddersfield]] and three colleges: [[Greenhead College]], [[Kirklees College]] and [[Huddersfield New College]]. The town is the birthplace of [[rugby league]] with the local team, [[Huddersfield Giants]], playing in the [[Super League]]. It also has a professional [[Association football|football]] team called [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], that currently competes in the {{English football updater|HuddersT}}, as well as two [[Rugby union|Rugby Union]] clubs [[Huddersfield R.U.F.C.]] and [[Huddersfield YM RUFC]]. Notable people include [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]]  and film star [[James Mason]].

The town has been classed under [[Yorkshire]], the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] and West Yorkshire for statistics throughout its history. The town's population in 1961 was 130,652 with an increase to 162,949 at the 2011 census; it is in the [[West Yorkshire Built-up Area]].<ref>{{cite news|url =http://www.examiner.co.uk/lifestyle/denis-kilcommons-huddersfield-11th-biggest-4883451|title = Denis Kilcommons: Huddersfield is the 11th biggest town in Britain|date = 4 June 2013|access-date=21 May 2014|newspaper = The Huddersfield Daily Examiner}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8705932/Britains-20-biggest-towns.html|title = Britain's 20 biggest towns|date = 18 August 2011|access-date=21 May 2014|newspaper = The Telegraph}}</ref> The town is {{convert|14|mi|0}} south-west of [[Leeds]], {{convert|12|mi|0}} west of [[Wakefield]], {{convert|23|mi|0}} north-west of [[Sheffield]] and {{convert|24|mi|0}} north-east of [[Manchester]].

==History==
===Iron age and Roman===
Local settlement dates back over 4,000 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirklees.gov.uk/events/venuedetails.asp?vID=45|title=Leisure and culture|date=1 November 2016|website=Kirklees.gov.uk|access-date=30 December 2017}}</ref> [[Castle Hill, Huddersfield|Castle Hill]], a major landmark, was the site of an [[Iron Age]] [[hill fort]]. The remains of a [[castra|Roman fort]] were unearthed in the mid 18th century at [[Slack Roman fort|Slack]] near [[Outlane]], west of the town.<ref>[[Ian Richmond|Ian A. Richmond]] (1925) ''[https://huddersfield.exposed/wiki/Huddersfield_in_Roman_Times_(1925)_by_Ian_A._Richmond Huddersfield in Roman Times]''.</ref>

===Toponymy===
The earliest surviving record of the place name is in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, ''Oderesfelt''. It appears as ''Hudresfeld'' in a Yorkshire charter from 1121 to 1127, and as ''Huderesfeld'' in [[subsidy roll]]s in 1297. The name meaning has not complicated with the shifts of English, remaining 'Hud(d)er's field'.<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'', p.255.</ref>

The modern name is pronounced without a word-initial /h/ in the local dialect, a trait independently shared by many Norman scribes' dialects of the Domesday Book era (see [[Old French|Old and modern French]]).{{cn|date=May 2024}}

===Market town and manor===
Huddersfield has been a [[market town]] since [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] times. The [[market cross]] is on Market Place.

The manor of Huddersfield was owned by long lease by the [[de Lacy family]] until its 1322 takeback by the Crown. In 1599, William Ramsden bought it, and the [[Ramsden baronets|Ramsden family]] continued to own the manor, which was known as the [[Ramsden Estate (Huddersfield)|Ramsden Estate]], until 1920. During their ownership they supported the development of the town. [[Sir John Ramsden, 3rd Baronet]] built the [[Huddersfield Cloth Hall]] in 1766 and his son [[Sir John Ramsden, 4th Baronet|the fourth baronet]] was responsible for [[Sir John Ramsden's Canal|Huddersfield Broad Canal]] in 1780. The Ramsdens endorsed the railway in the first wave of national railway building, in the 1840s.<ref name=hudhist>{{cite web|title=Huddersfield's history |url=https://www.huddersfieldhistory.org.uk/huddersfields-history/ |publisher=Huddersfield Local History Society |access-date=9 August 2022}}</ref>

Huddersfield was a centre of civil unrest during the [[Industrial Revolution]] in which Europe saw frequent wars during and after which, as to those most acutely affecting Britain, cloth trade slumped which could be compounded by local crops failure, many local [[Weaver (occupation)|weavers]] faced starvation and losing their livelihood due to the new, mechanised [[weaving shed]]s. [[Luddite]]s began destroying the mills, sheds and machinery at such times; one of the most notorious attacks was on Cartwright – a Huddersfield mill-owner who had a reputation for cruelty – and his Rawfolds Mill. [[Kirkpatrick Sale]] describes how an army platoon was stationed at Huddersfield to deal with these; at its peak, having about a thousand soldiers and ten thousand civilians. Luddites thus began to focus criminal damage on nearby towns and villages (less well-protected); their most damaging act was to destroy Foster's Mill at [[Horbury]] – a village about {{convert|10|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} east.<ref>{{cite book

===H. H. Asquith and H. Wilson===
Two Prime Ministers spent part of their childhood in Huddersfield: [[Harold Wilson]], born locally attended [[Royds Hall School]], and [[H. H. Asquith]]. Wilson is commemorated by a statue on the ([[Courtyard|forecourt]]) to the town's station.

===Aristocratic interest discharged===
In 1920, the Corporation bought the Ramsden Estate from that family that had owned much of the town at least as to the [[reversion (law)|reversion of long leases]] (a minor, overarching interest) since 1599, for £1.3&nbsp;million. The town became "the town that bought itself". Most of the keynote central building freeholds belong to the local authority, as in a few towns in Britain such as [[Basingstoke]].<ref name=hudhist/>

==Governance==
[[File:Coat of Arms of Huddersfield County Borough Council.svg|thumb|100px|left|[[Coat of arms of Huddersfield|Coat of arms of the former County Borough]]]]
Huddersfield was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]] in the ancient [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] in 1868. The borough comprised the thus sidelined [[civil parishes in England|civil parishes]] of Almondbury, Dalton, Huddersfield, Lindley-cum-Quarmby and Lockwood, later dissolved. When the West Riding County Council was formed in 1889, Huddersfield became a [[county borough]], exempt from its control.
A more confined Huddersfield seat than the early 20th century scope has been represented by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] since its creation in 1983 and is, by size of majority and length of tenure, [[safe seat|a strongly-Labour leaning seat]].
[[File:Harold Wilson statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Sir Harold Wilson]] on St George's Square]]
Kirklees was the first part of the country to have a [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green]] or other environmentalist party councillor – Nicholas Harvey – he was instrumental in protesting against the intended closure of the [[Settle and Carlisle Railway]] line.<ref>{{cite web

Huddersfield expanded in 1937, assimilating parts of the [[Golcar]], [[Linthwaite]], and [[South Crosland]] urban districts.<ref>{{cite web

Council bids to gain support for [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] were rejected by the people in a poll held by the ''[[Huddersfield Daily Examiner]]''; the council did not apply for that status in the 2000 or 2002 competitions.<ref>{{cite web

Huddersfield had a strong Liberal tradition up to the 1950s reflected in several Liberal social clubs. The current Member of Parliament (MP) for the [[Huddersfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Huddersfield constituency]] is [[Harpreet Uppal]], a Labour MP.

===Demographic change===
The town's population in 1961 had reached 130,652.<ref>{{cite web |title=Huddersfield CP/AP through time {{!}} Statistics {{!}} |url=https://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10436412/cube/TOT_POP |access-date=1 April 2024 |website=www.visionofbritain.org.uk}}</ref>

Per the [[United Kingdom Census 2001]] the population of the town's urban sub-area of the [[West Yorkshire Urban Area]] was 146,234, and that of the former extent of the county borough was 121,620. The wider ''South Kirklees'' had a population of 216,011.

==Geography==
Huddersfield has the merger of the shallow valley floors of the [[River Colne, West Yorkshire|River Colne]] and the [[River Holme|Holme]] south of the town centre. This is in the eastern foothills of the [[Pennines]] which blend into the moorlands of the [[South Pennines]] west of the town.

===Climate===
As with all of West Yorkshire a temperate [[oceanic climate]] exists, wetter than the low plains [[rain shadow]] proper towards [[East Yorkshire]] but drier than [[Cumbria]]. It is mild for the latitude – overnight frosts are quite frequent in winter yet daytime tends to exceed such temperatures due to onshore breezes from around Britain and as the [[Gulf Stream]] moderates temperatures. Summers are usually warm, punctuated by frequent rainy and hot spells. Winters are usually cool and damp, punctuated by frequent cold spells where snow is possible, especially on higher ground. According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Huddersfield is certified as ''Cfb''.

===Divisions and suburbs===
After boundary changes in 2004, Huddersfield now covers eight of the twenty-three [[Ward (country subdivision)|electoral wards]] for Kirklees Council. Neighbouring wards in the [[Colne Valley]], [[Holme Valley]], and [[Kirkburton]] are often considered to be part of Huddersfield though they are predominantly [[rural|semi-rural]]. The very centre of town forms the [[wards of the United Kingdom|Newsome ward]] of councillors. Eight wards make up Huddersfield proper; these with populations, extent and constituent suburbs (mid-year 2005 estimates) are:

===Green belt===
{{further|South and West Yorkshire Green Belt}}
Huddersfield is within a [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] region that extends into the Kirklees borough and wider surrounding counties. It is in place to reduce [[urban sprawl]], prevent the towns in the [[West Yorkshire Urban Area]] conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage [[brownfield]] reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas, and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.<ref name="belt1">{{cite web|title=Green Belt review|url=https://www.kirklees.gov.uk/beta/planning-policy/pdf/submission-documents/SD19_Kirklees_Local_Plan_Green_Belt_Review_April_2017.pdf/|website=www.kirklees.gov.uk|access-date=27 March 2018|archive-date=22 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322204532/https://www.kirklees.gov.uk/beta/planning-policy/pdf/submission-documents/SD19_Kirklees_Local_Plan_Green_Belt_Review_April_2017.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The green belt surrounds the Huddersfield built-up area, a much-wooded [[buffer zone]]. Larger outlying communities such as Upper Hopton, Grange Moor, Highburton, [[Farnley Tyas]], Netherton, [[Honley]], [[Outlane]], [[Slaithwaite]], Wellhouse are exempt from this. Nearby smaller villages, hamlets and rural areas such as Thurgory, [[Gawthorpe, Kirklees|Gawthorpe Green]], Bog Green, Upper Heaton, [[Wilberlee]], [[South Crosland]], Rushfield Bridge, and Bank End see their unbuilt land included in the designation. Much semi-rural land on the fringes forms the rest. It was chiefly defined in the 1960s,<ref name="belt1"/> and across Kirklees covers about 70%, i.e. {{convert|23,050|ha|acre}} (2017, excluding the [[Peak District]] National Park).<ref>{{cite web|title=Green belt statistics – GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/green-belt-statistics|website=www.gov.uk|date=12 October 2023 }}</ref><ref name="belt1"/>

A subsidiary aim is to encourage play, sport and leisure,<ref name="belt1"/> through woodland, moor, streams, green meadows, fields, small bogs. Features are:
*[[Castle Hill, Huddersfield|Castle Hill]] with Victoria Tower
*Coal Pit Scrog and Hall Wood in Lepton
*Blackmoorfoot reservoir
*Longwood reservoir
*Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Colne
*The Holme (river and paths)
*[[Storthes Hall]]
*Kirkheaton cricket ground
*Beaumont Park.

West of [[Marsden, West Yorkshire|Marsden]], [[Meltham]] and [[Holmbridge]], it borders the north limb of the [[Peak District National Park]].

==Economy==

[[File:Huddsview.jpg|thumb|The bridge carrying the railway entering the station, the stadium, gas holder and Kilner bank viewed from the top of Fitzwilliam Street]]

=== Industry ===
Huddersfield is a manufacturing town, despite the university being the largest employer. Historically the town produced woollen textiles. This area of business, along with the chemical and engineering industries that emerged to support the manufacture of textiles, was the basis of the town's nineteenth and early twentieth century prosperity. The number of people who work in textiles has declined greatly, but the surviving companies produce large quantities of [[Woolen|woollen]] products with little labour. The town is home to textile, chemical and engineering companies, including Brook Motors Ltd founded by Ernest Brook in 1904. Against conventional wisdom, he started making [[alternating current]] electric motors, and he did this in one room with two assistants and starting capital of just £300. On its 50th anniversary in 1954 it employed more than 2,000 people and, with Ernest's sons Frank and Jack in charge, was the largest exclusive producer of AC motors in the world, and had a turnover of £4,500,000. That same year Brook Motors Ltd operated 10 factories in Huddersfield, its biggest being Empress Works on St Thomas's Road, and opened one at Barugh Green, Barnsley. Other local manufacturers are [[Cummins|Cummins Turbo Technologies]], founded in 1952 as Holset by Messrs. Holmes and Croset.<ref>{{cite news|title=History of Holset turbochargers|url=http://www.myholsetturbo.com/holsethistory.html}}</ref> (turbochargers), David Brown Gear systems (industrial gearing), Huddersfield Fine Worsteds (textiles), Taylor & Lodge (textiles), C & J Antich (textiles), Syngenta AG ([[Agrichemical|agro-chemicals]]), [[Pennine Radio Limited]] ([[electronics]] [[transformer]]s and sheet [[metalworking]]) and a large number of niche manufacturers, such as Dual Seal Glass (maker of spandrel glass panels<ref>{{cite news|last=Zientek|first=Henryk|date=4 November 2011|title=Dual Seal Glass named Business of the Year|newspaper=The Huddersfield Daily Examiner|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/business/dual-seal-glass-named-business-4963685|access-date=19 August 2014}}</ref>) and Ellis Furniture (producer of kitchen and bathroom furniture).<ref>{{cite news|date=30 August 2012|title=Ellis Furniture – the Huddersfield family business still going strong after 120 years – Interiors|newspaper=Yorkshire Life|url=http://www.yorkshirelife.co.uk/homes-gardens/interiors/ellis_furniture_the_huddersfield_family_business_still_going_strong_after_120_years_1_1571449|access-date=19 August 2014}}</ref> Huddersfield is home to Andrew Jones Pies, a regional award-winning pie-maker, and [[Mamas and Papas]], a manufacturer and retailer of prams, pushchairs and related items and specialist pneumatics supplier Shelley Automation Ltd.

=== Health ===
[[File:HuddersfieldRoyalInfirmary.jpg|thumb|left|[[Huddersfield Royal Infirmary]].]]
[[Huddersfield Royal Infirmary]] is in [[Lindley, West Yorkshire|Lindley]]. Medical services are split between there and the [[Calderdale Royal Hospital]] at [[Salterhebble]], near [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]]. [[Kirkwood Hospice]] provides care for the [[terminal illness|terminally ill]], and is dependent on donations and charitable gifts. Princess Royal Hospital provided [[maternity]] facilities until the risks of not being able to get an ambulance to [[Emergency department|A&E]] in the event of complications were judged to outweigh the benefits of specialist service provision. It now functions as a day clinic, [[family planning]] consultation centre and [[Sexual health clinic|GUM Clinic]]. A decision to move most maternity services provided by the Calderdale & Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust to the Calderdale Royal Hospital ended the provision in 2007, despite strong local opposition. The campaign was led by [[Save Huddersfield NHS]] which elected a councillor, Dr Jackie Grunsell in the Crosland Moor ward.  In January 2016 plans were announced to close the A&E department of Huddersfield Royal Infirmary and have all emergency cases go to Calderdale Royal instead. This sparked uproar in local communities as it would mean journeys from some areas of over 40 minutes to and from the hospital assuming that the main road into Halifax was not congested, as it frequently is.<ref>{{cite news|date=15 January 2016|title=RECAP: Huddersfield Royal Infirmary set to be demolished as part of A&E closure plan|work=The Huddersfield Examiner|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/recap-huddersfield-royal-infirmary-set-10739008}}</ref>

The former [[St Luke's Hospital, Huddersfield|St. Luke's Hospital]] in [[Crosland Moor]] mostly provided [[geriatric]] and [[psychiatric]] care. It closed in 2011 and the land was sold to a developer; this land is now home to Fitzwilliam Grange, a housing estate.

[[Platform 1]] is a charity established in 2018 and provides a space and advice for men struggling with mental health.

===Entertainment===
[[File:Lawrence Batley Theatre - Queen Street - geograph.org.uk - 617687.jpg|thumb|[[Lawrence Batley Theatre]]]]
The [[Lawrence Batley Theatre]], opened in 1994, in what was once the largest [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Wesleyan Chapel]] in the world,<ref>{{Google books|hjM9AAAAIAAJ|Medicine and society in Wakefield and Huddersfield, 1780–1870|page=30}}</ref> and presents dance, drama, comedy, music and exhibitions and is the base for Full Body and The Voice, a company concerned with the integration of disabled people into mainstream theatre. Kelly Rowlands also holds the 2003 Line Dancing championship Record.

The [[John Smith's Stadium]], (formerly the Galpharm Stadium and Alfred McAlpine Stadium), is a multi-use sports stadium with a gym, swimming pool, spa and offers sporting classes. The stadium is home to Huddersfield Giants and Huddersfield Town football team. Adjacent the stadium is an [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon cinema]] (formerly UCI).

There are many pubs, restaurants and night clubs, one of which, [[Tokyo Industries|Tokyo]], which closed in 2019, occupies the former Huddersfield [[County Court]], a 19th-century [[Grade II listed building]]. The oldest pub is ''The Parish'',{{efn|formerly the Fleece Inn}} trading since 1720.

Huddersfield has a large and diverse retail shopping area, enclosed within the town's ring road, compared with other towns of its size. There are three shopping areas: [[Kingsgate Shopping Centre|Kingsgate]], The Packhorse Precinct and [[Piazza Centre|The Piazza Centre]]. The Piazza offers an outdoor shopping mall near the public library, with a grassed area, used for relaxation and events throughout the year such as entertainment, international markets and iceskating in winter. Through the adjacent Market Arcade is a covered market hall, which has listed building status, due in part to its distinctive roof formed by [[Hyperbola|hyperbolic]] [[paraboloid]]s. It is adjacent to the town hall and public library. An open market trades next to [[Tesco]], on the other side of the town centre.

The town centre is home to several national high street retailers and chain stores. There are also a variety of small specialist and independent shops, many in the three-storey Victorian shopping arcade, Byram Arcade, on street, Westgate.

However over the last decade many shops have closed down causing a general decline of the town centre.<ref>{{cite web|last=Himelfield|first=Dave|date=17 January 2019|title=High street chains that have left our town centre in last 10 years|url=https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/news/business/high-street-chains-left-huddersfield-15691605|access-date=26 February 2019|website=huddersfieldexaminer}}</ref> Most notability the closure of [[British Home Stores|British Home Stores (BHS)]] in 2016 left a large shopping unit empty in The Piazza Centre. In 2019 [[Marks & Spencer]] announced 17 closures within the UK, one of these was the Huddersfield store.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wood|first=Zoe|date=15 January 2019|title=Marks & Spencer closes 17 more stores in new blow to high street|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/15/marks-and-spencer-stores-close-m-and-s-hull|access-date=26 February 2019|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Huddersfield Choral Society founded in 1836, claims to be the UK's leading [[choir|choral society]]. Its history was chronicled in the book'' 'And The Glory''',<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://huddersfieldchoral.com/page--about-huddersfield-choral.html|access-date=12 October 2008|publisher=Huddersfield Choral Society|archive-date=30 August 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830015129/http://www.huddersfieldchoral.com/page--about-huddersfield-choral.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> written to commemorate the society's 150th anniversary in 1986 – its title derived from a chorus in [[George Frideric Handel|Handel's]] landmark Oratorio ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]''.

The annual [[Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival]] is held in the town which is also home to the [[Huddersfield Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the [[Huddersfield Singers]].

On Christmas Day 1977, the [[Sex Pistols]] played their last two British shows, a matinee for the children of striking firefighters, at Ivanhoe's nightclub, before embarking on their ill-fated US tour which saw the group's acrimonious collapse. In the early-mid-1990s, Flex, an underground Jungle/[[Drum and bass|Drum 'n' Bass]] record label, was founded by musician and [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] DJ, L Double. In 2000 another independent record label Chocolate Fireguard Records was founded by singer Pat Fulgoni who developed a three-stage community music event, [[Timeless Festival]], in Ravensknowle Park, featuring a range of electronica, [[hip hop]] and rock music.

There are other annual music festivals held in the town and surrounding area, examples being the [[Marsden, West Yorkshire|Marsden]] [[Jazz]] Festival,<ref>{{cite web|title=Marsden Jazz Festival Home Page|url=http://www.marsdenjazzfestival.com|access-date=9 October 2008|publisher=Marsdenjazzfestival.com}}</ref> Mrs Sunderland,<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to The Mrs Sunderland Music Festival|url=http://www.mrs-sunderlandmusic.org.uk/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211175840/http://www.mrs-sunderlandmusic.org.uk/|archive-date=11 December 2008|access-date=9 October 2008|publisher=Mrs-sunderlandmusic.org.uk}}</ref> Electric Spring,<ref>{{cite web|title=Electric Spring 2020|url=http://electricspring.co.uk/|access-date=14 March 2020}}</ref> Janet Beaumont, the [[Holmfirth]] Festivals, and the Haydn Wood (Linthwaite). The Haydn Wood (for under 21s) and Mrs Sunderland festival focus on musical and oratorial performance. The Electric Spring festival is an exploration of electronic and experimental music, featuring the 50-channel, 64-loudspeaker [http://www.thehiss.org/ Huddersfield Immersive Sound System] (HISS). The Mrs Sunderland Music festival is the second oldest in the United Kingdom, started in 1889 lasting for nine days each year. Free music concerts have been put on for the town, including bands such as the Ordinary Boys, the Script and Elliott Minor. There are many local choirs, youth and adult, a noted example of the latter being the [[Honley]] Male Voice Choir.<ref>{{cite web|title=Honley Male Voice Choir :: Home|url=http://www.honleymvc.co.uk|access-date=3 February 2014|publisher=Honleymvc.co.uk}}</ref> Home-grown musical talent of all kinds is complemented by the student intake to the [[University of Huddersfield]]'s music department. "The Sheriff of Huddersfield" is a song by heavy metal band [[Iron Maiden]] on the B-side of their 1986 single "[[Wasted Years]]", written about their co-manager [[Rod Smallwood]], leaving his home town of Huddersfield and struggling to settle into life in Los Angeles. Huddersfield is home to [[thrash metal]] band [[Evile]], dance rock band [[Kava Kava (band)|Kava Kava]], the birthplace of the synthpop musician [[Billy Currie]] (of [[Ultravox]] and [[Visage (band)|Visage]]), and the hard rock bassist [[John McCoy (musician)|John McCoy]] who played with [[Neo (UK band)|Neo]] and [[Gillan (band)|Gillan]].

The Pack Horse Centre is a covered [[pedestrianised]] shopping area constructed over a [[cobblestone]] street, Pack Horse Yard, renamed Pack Horse Walk. [[Pack horse]]s carried merchandise over pack-horse routes across the [[Pennines]] before [[Toll road|turnpike]] roads and railways improved transportation. The pedestrian link passes from Kirkgate, across King Street and along Victoria Lane, by the Shambles, to the Piazza and the distinctive market hall at Queensgate, which was built to replace the old Shambles Market Hall in the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite web

[[Beaumont Park]] about {{convert|2|mi|km|0|abbr=off|spell=on}} south of the town centre was bequeathed to the town in the 1880s, by Henry Frederick Beaumont ("Beaumont's of Whitley" estate) and was opened on 13 October 1883, by [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany|Prince Leopold]], fourth son of [[Queen Victoria]], and his wife [[Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont]] (Duke and Duchess of Albany). It is a fine example of a [[Victorian era]] public park with water cascades, bandstand and woodland.

The former St Paul's Church on Queensgate has statutory recognition and protection,{{efn|Being a [[listed building]] in the initial, mainstream, Grade II class}} used for worship from 1831 to 1956.

==Transport==
[[File:Huddersfieldmap 1954.png|thumb|right|Map of Huddersfield from 1954]]

===Road===
[[File:Chapel Hill - geograph.org.uk - 324954.jpg|thumb|Chapel Hill]]
Huddersfield is connected to the motorway network via the [[M1 motorway|M1]] and [[M62 motorway|M62]] motorways. The M1 passes about {{convert|10|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} to the east. The M62 passes about {{convert|2+1/2|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} to the north, and Huddersfield is linked to it by three junctions: Mount ([[A640 road|A640]], J23 – limited access), Ainley Top ([[A629 road|A629]], J24) and between [[Brighouse]] and Cooper Bridge ([[A644 road|A644]], J25).

Huddersfield Corporation built an inner [[ring road]], part of the [[A62 road|A62]], in the 1970s. The ring road now defines the boundary of the town's central business district. Its construction ended congestion within, where many roads are [[pedestrianised]].

Main radial roads are the:
*A62 Leeds Road
*[[A641 road|A641]] Bradford Road
*A629 Halifax Road, 
*A640 New Hey Road
*A642 Wakefield Road (in east branching into the A629: Penistone Road)

[[File:Huddersfield Bus Station and Multi Storey Car Park . - geograph.org.uk - 313297.jpg|thumb|[[Huddersfield bus station]]]]
Huddersfield's bus operators reflect the national situation; local subsidiaries of three dominant national operators provide most services in the area: [[First Calderdale & Huddersfield]] provide most local services in Huddersfield and some services outside Kirklees with destinations including Bradford, Brighouse, Halifax, Manchester and [[Oldham]]. [[Arriva Yorkshire]] provide frequent services to Dewsbury and Leeds, and [[Team Pennine]] provide almost all services in the south east of the town. Other smaller operators include Stotts Coaches and Team Pennine. Centrebus Holdings purchased Teamdeck in May 2008, along with [[Stagecoach Yorkshire]]'s Huddersfield depot.<ref>{{cite news|date=3 May 2008|title=Stagecoach operation is sold – but not to Arriva|newspaper=The Huddersfield Daily Examiner|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/express-and-chronicle/2008/05/03/stagecoach-operation-is-sold-but-not-to-arriva-86081-20874542/|url-status=dead|access-date=19 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320044050/http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/express-and-chronicle/2008/05/03/stagecoach-operation-is-sold-but-not-to-arriva-86081-20874542/|archive-date=20 March 2012}}</ref> In November 2006, a [[Zero-fare public transport|zero-fare]] town centre bus service, the [[FreeCityBus|Free Town Bus]], was launched run by K-Line in partnership with Kirklees Council and Metro.

[[Association football|Association]] and [[rugby league]] football codes are the main spectator sports in Huddersfield. The [[John Smith's Stadium]] is home to both professional clubs in the town. The [[Huddersfield Giants|rugby club]] left its [[Fartown Ground|Fartown]] home to share the association football club's ground at [[Leeds Road, Huddersfield|Leeds Road]], both clubs then left Leeds Road in 1994 to share the stadium. The town also has [[Rugby Union]] clubs and the [[Huddersfield Rams Aussie Rules]] club. In May 2022 the town made national and world headlines when its 2 professional sports teams both played in finals in London on the same weekend on the 28/29 May<ref>{{cite web | url=https://huddersfieldhub.co.uk/believe-its-huddersfields-big-weekend-in-london-as-huddersfield-giants-and-huddersfield-town-go-for-glory-in-the-capital/ | title=Believe!

=== Association Football ===
[[File:Chelsea 1 Huddersfield 1 (42045745051).jpg|thumb|[[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield]] away at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the [[2017–18 Premier League|Premier League (2018)]]]]
Its professional association football team, [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town A.F.C.]] is the town's senior association football team, founded in 1908, and most seasons play in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]], the second highest league of the sport nationally. In 1926, the club became the first in England to win three successive league titles, a feat only four other clubs have matched.

In 1921–22 Huddersfield won the [[FA Cup]] and between 1923 and 1926 became the first club to win the [[Football League First Division|League Championship]] three times in a row, an achievement matched only by four other teams. After several decades in lower divisions, Huddersfield Town FC returned to top flight football in 2017 when the club entered the Premier League for the first time.

Notable ex-players include Scottish international [[Denis Law]], [[Ray Wilson (English footballer)|Ray Wilson]], a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] winner with [[England national football team|England]] in 1966 and [[Trevor Cherry]], England international.
[[Herbert Chapman]], [[Bill Shankly]], [[Neil Warnock]] and [[Steve Bruce]] are notable former Huddersfield Town managers.

[[File:Emleyafc.jpg|thumb|[[Emley A.F.C.]] play at the Welfare Ground]]

[[Shelley Community F.C.|Shelley]] are also within the town's boundaries and most recently played in the [[West Yorkshire Association Football League]] having previously played alongside Emley and Golcar in the [[North West Counties Football League]] Division 1 North.

=== Rugby ===
Rugby was first played in the town in 1848 and the Huddersfield Athletic Club, formed in 1864 and played its first rugby game in 1866. The town was the birthplace of rugby league. On 29 August 1895, 22 northern clubs met in the [[George Hotel, Huddersfield|George Hotel]] and voted to [[Secession|secede]] from the [[Rugby Football Union]] and set up the 'Northern Rugby Football Union' which became the [[Rugby Football League]] in 1922. The [[Rugby League Heritage Centre]] was in the George Hotel's basement before the hotel closed in 2013.

==== League ====
Following the split of 1895, Huddersfield became a focus for rugby league.  HAC's direct successors, the [[Huddersfield Giants]], who played the famous [[Fartown Ground]] until 1992 before sharing with the Football club,  play in the [[Super League]]. It is the top division in Europe. [[Huddersfield Rugby Union Football Club]] play in [[National Division Three North]] and [[Huddersfield Y.M.C.A. RUFC]] play in [[North 1 East]]. [[Huddersfield Giants]], the town's rugby league club, has won the [[Rugby Football League Championship]] seven times, most recently in 1961–62, and the [[Challenge Cup]] six times, the last time in 1952–53.

The town is also home to the [[Huddersfield Underbank Rangers]], who play in the Rugby League Conference. The club is based in [[Holmfirth]] and formed in 1884. It has launched the careers of many professional players including [[Harold Wagstaff]], [[Paul Dixon (rugby league)|Paul Dixon]] and [[Eorl Crabtree]].

==== Union ====
[[File:Lockwoodpk.2.jpg|thumb|Huddersfield RUFC's Lockwood Park, under the viaduct carrying the [[Penistone Line]]]]
After 1895 rugby union was played exclusively under the Northern Rugby Football Union until 1909 when Huddersfield Old Boys were formed to play under [[rugby union]] rules, playing nomadically at five grounds until buying farmland at [[Waterloo, Huddersfield|Waterloo]] in 1919 and, in 1946, renaming the club [[Huddersfield Rugby Union Football Club|Huddersfield RUFC]]. In 1969 the club was at the forefront of a revolution in English rugby when it became the first club in the country to organise mini and junior rugby teams. The innovation spread and almost every club in the country has a thriving junior section providing a production-line of home-grown talent. Junior players at Huddersfield number over 200. In 1997 the Waterloo junior grounds were sold and the {{convert|26|acre|ha|0|abbr=off|adj=on}} former [[Bass Brewery]] site at [[Huddersfield R.U.F.C.#Lockwood Park|Lockwood Park]] was purchased for its replacement. With the assistance of a £2&nbsp;million grant from [[Sport England]], the club has transformed it into a major sports complex, conference centre and business park.

=== Aussie rules ===
[[Huddersfield Rams Aussie Rules]] is an Australian rules football team, formed in 2008. The club played its first season in 2009 and won the [[Aussie Rules UK]] National League – Central Division and took part in the North West Division in 2010.

[[File:Freedom Scroll DWR Huddersfield (RLH).JPG|thumb|right|upright|DWR Freedom Scroll]]
On 2 July 1952, in recognition of historic ties and links with the [[The Duke of Wellington's Regiment|Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding)]], the Huddersfield County Borough had conferred on the regiment the Freedom of the Town. This gave the regiment the right to march through the town with 'flags flying, bands playing and bayonets fixed'. Many of the town and district's male residents had served in the regiment during its long history. This right was technically lost when merged with Dewsbury to form Kirklees MBC. On 25 March 1979, the latter gave the Freedom of Kirklees to the 3rd battalion of the Yorkshire Volunteers; this being the Duke of Wellington's [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] unit.

[[File:Yorkshire Regiment, Freedom of Huddersfield(RLH)2008-10-25.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Conferring the Freedom of Huddersfield on the [[Yorkshire Regiment]] 25 October 2008]]
When the 'Dukes' were amalgamated with the [[Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire]] and the [[The Green Howards|Green Howards]]' to form the [[Yorkshire Regiment]] on 6 June 2006 the right to march became extinct. The Regiment requested a resumed right to march. The right given by Kirklees to the 3rd battalion of the Yorkshire Volunteers did not permit any transfer to heirs or successors and effectively ceased when the battalion was amalgamated into the [[East and West Riding Regiment]] (since 2006 being the Yorkshire Regiment's 4th Battalion). Kirklees Metropolitan Borough Council amended the original 'Freedom' and transferred it to the Yorkshire Regiment, at a Freedom parade on 25 October 2008.

*[[Haddersfield, Jamaica]], locally referred to and named for Huddersfield<ref name="haddersfield">'During the periods 1822–1832 the 33rd Regiment of Foot, recruited from West Yorkshire was stationed in Jamaica. At the end of the tour 142 men chose to remain in Jamaica, having married and raised families, some of which may have originated from Huddersfield, thereby originating the name. Over 560 officers and men died and were buried in Jamaica during this period, from endemic diseases. On 18 June 1853 the regiment formally became known as "The 33rd (or The Duke of Wellington's) Regiment". The regiment's second battalion was again posted to Jamaica (Newcastle Camp) from 18 March 1891 to 10 April 1893. {{cite book
