===Early modern period===

====Shokuhō period====
[[Katō Kiyomasa]], a contemporary of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], was made ''[[daimyō]]'' of half of the (old) administrative region of [[Higo Province|Higo]] in 1588. Afterwards, Kiyomasa built [[Kumamoto Castle]]. Due to its many innovative defensive designs, Kumamoto Castle was considered impenetrable, and Kiyomasa enjoyed a reputation as one of the finest castle-builders in Japanese history.

====Edo period====
After Kiyomasa died in 1611, his son, Tadahiro, succeeded him. In 1632, Tadahiro was removed by [[Tokugawa Iemitsu]] and replaced with the [[Hosokawa clan]]. [[Hosokawa Tadatoshi]], the third lord of Kumamoto, was the patron of the artist<ref>{{Cite web|date=2009|title=Art of Miyamoto Musashi|url=http://www.ecole-miyamoto-musashi.com/liens.html|access-date=August 12, 2020|website=ecole-miyamoto-musashi.com}}</ref> and [[swordsman]] [[Miyamoto Musashi]]<ref>Wilson, ''The Lone Samurai'', pp. 104–105.</ref>

==Landmarks==
===Kumamoto Castle===
[[File:Kumamoto Castle 02n3200.jpg|thumb|Kumamoto Castle]]

The city's most famous landmark is [[Kumamoto Castle]], a large and once extremely well fortified Japanese castle. The ''[[donjon]]'' (castle central keep) is a concrete reconstruction built in the 1970s, but several ancillary wooden buildings from the original castle remain.  The castle was assaulted during the [[Satsuma Rebellion]] and sacked and burned after a 53-day [[siege]]. It was during this time that the tradition of eating ''[[Horse meat|basashi]]'' (raw horse meat) originated. ''Basashi'' remains popular in Kumamoto and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in Japan, although these days it is usually considered a delicacy.

Within the outer walls of Kumamoto Castle is the Hosokawa Gyobu-tei, the former residence of the Higo ''[[daimyō]]''. This traditional wooden mansion has a fine [[Japanese garden]] located on its grounds.

===Religious sites===
The first of many [[peace pagoda]]s around the world was erected by Japanese Buddhist monk [[Nichidatsu Fujii]] atop [[Mount Hanaoka]] beginning 1947.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xCvMjYVqkMIC&pg=PA52|pages=52–53|title=Prophets of Peace: Pacifism and Cultural Identity in Japan's New Religions|first=Robert|last=Kisala|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1999|isbn=9780824822675}}</ref>  Inaugurated in 1954, it was the first of over 80 built by Fujii and his followers all over the world.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hzmJjiynUb8C&pg=PA81|page=81|first=Jacqueline I.|last=Stone|title=Action Dharma: New Studies in Engaged Buddhism|editor1-first=Christopher S.|editor1-last=Queen|editor2-first=Charles S.|editor2-last=Prebish|editor3-first=Damien|editor3-last=Keown|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2003|isbn=9780700715947}}</ref>

===Suizenji area===
[[File: Suizenji_jojuen_garden.jpg|265x265px|right|thumb |Suizenji jojuen garden]]

Kumamoto is home to [[Suizen-ji Jōju-en]], a formal garden neighboring Suizenji Temple approximately 3 kilometers southeast of Kumamoto Castle.  Suizenji Park is also home to the Suizenji Municipal Stadium, where the city's [[football (soccer)|football]] team, [[Roasso Kumamoto]], used to play regularly.  The team now uses the larger [[KKWing Stadium]] in Higashi Ward.

===Other notable sites===
[[Miyamoto Musashi]] lived the last part of his life in Kumamoto. His tomb and the cave where he resided during his final years (known as [[Reigandō]], or "spirit rock cave") are situated close by. He penned the famous ''Go Rin no Sho'' (''[[The Book of Five Rings]]'') whilst living here.

The downtown area has a commercial district centred on two shopping arcades, the Shimotori and Kamitori, which extend for several city blocks. The main department stores are located here along with a large number of smaller retailers, restaurants, and bars. Many local festivals are held in or near the arcades.

Cultural venues include the [[Kumamoto Prefectural Museum of Art]] and [[Kumamoto Prefectural Theater]].
