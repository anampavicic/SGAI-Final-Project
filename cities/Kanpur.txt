== History ==
In 1207, Raja Kanha-deo of the [[Kanhpuriya]] clan of [[Rajput]]s established the city of Kanhpur and made it his capital, which later came to be known as Kanpur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.journeymart.com/de/india/uttar-pradesh/kanpur-history.aspx |title=Kanpur History - History of Kanpur City- History of Kanpur India |publisher=Journeymart.com |access-date=29 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702060614/http://www.journeymart.com/de/india/uttar-pradesh/kanpur-history.aspx |archive-date=2 July 2015 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://dspace.wbpublibnet.gov.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/10689/26681/8/Chapter%207_479-525p.pdf |title=Man |page=479 |publisher=Dspace.wbpublisher.gov.in |access-date=29 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702143405/http://dspace.wbpublibnet.gov.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/10689/26681/8/Chapter%207_479-525p.pdf |archive-date=2 July 2015 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

The area was ruled by several rulers of Kannauj, such as Harsha Vardhan, Jai Chand and [[Mihir Bhoja]].{{cn|date=January 2024}} It was also ruled by Muslim rulers of the [[Sur dynasty]]. In May 1765, [[Shuja-ud-daula]], the [[Nawab]] of [[Awadh]], was defeated by the British near [[Jajmau]]. From 1773 to 1801, Kanpur was part of the [[Oudh State|Oudh Kingdom]], followed by the treaty of 1801 between [[Saadat Ali Khan I|Nawab Saadat Ali Khan]] of Awadh and the British, who realized the strategic importance. Several European businessmen established themselves in Kanpur, during this time.{{cn|date=January 2024}}

With the first woollen mill of [[British Raj|India]], commonly known as the '''Lal Imli''' ({{literally|Red Tamarind}}, for a brand produced by the mill) by the [[British India Corporation]] established here in 1876 by [[Sir Alexander MacRobert, 1st Baronet|Alexander MacRobert]].{{cn|date=January 2024}} The eastern and northern [[façade]]s of the mill are reminiscent of the [[Palace of Westminster]], due to their architecture, proximity to the [[Ganges]] river and with the north-east corner of the mill being topped by a clock tower similar to [[Big Ben]] in [[London]].{{cn|date=January 2024}} This similarity underscores the city's importance and prestige during the [[British Raj|British]] times, which extends till date; making the Lal Imli — a great highlight of the city. The city is also widely regarded as the ''"Leather City of the World"'' and is predominantly nicknamed as the ''"Manchester of the East"'', for its chemical, textile and leather industries. Alexander MacRobert has an area named after him in the city, [[McRobertganj]].{{cn|date=January 2024}}

=== 1857 Uprising ===
{{main|Siege of Cawnpore}}
[[File:Kanpur from the river.jpg|thumb|left|Kanpur from the river in 1858]]
In the 19th century, Cawnpore was an important [[Kanpur Cantonment|British garrison]] with barracks for 7,000 soldiers. During the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], 900 British men, women and children [[Siege of Cawnpore|were besieged]] in the fortifications for 22 days by rebels under [[Nana Saheb Peshwa II|Nana Sahib]]. They surrendered on the agreement that they would get safe passage to the nearby [[Massacre Ghat|Sati Chaura Ghat]] whereupon they would board barges and be allowed to go by river to [[Allahabad]].<ref name="caleb_wright_historic">{{cite book | last =  Wright | first = Caleb | title = Historic Incidents and Life in India | orig-year = 1863 | url = https://archive.org/details/historicinciden00braigoog | publisher = J.

Though controversy surrounds what exactly happened at the Sati Chaura Ghat, and who fired the first shot, it is known that, soon afterwards, the departing British were shot at by the sepoys and were either killed or captured. Some of the British officers later claimed that the sepoys had, on purpose, placed the boats as high in the mud as possible, to cause delay. They also claimed that Nana Sahib's camp had previously arranged for the sepoys to fire upon and to kill all of the English. Although the East India Company later accused Nana Sahib of betrayal and murder of innocent people, no evidence has ever been found to prove that Nana Sahib had planned or ordered the massacre. Some historians believe that the Sati Chaura Ghat massacre was the result of confusion and not of any plan implemented by Nana Sahib or of his associates. Lieutenant Mowbray Thomson, one of the four male survivors of the massacre, believed that the rank-and-file sepoys who spoke to him did not know of the killing to come.<ref>{{cite book | last = Sen | first = Surendra Nath | title = Eighteen Fifty-seven | orig-year = 1957 | year = 1995 | publisher = Publications Division, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Government of India | isbn = 978-81-230-0093-0 | page = 145 }}</ref>

Many were killed and the remaining 200 British women and children were brought back to shore and sent to a building called the Bibighar (''House of the Ladies''). After some time, the commanders of the rebels decided to kill their hostages. The rebel soldiers refused to carry out orders and butchers from the nearby town were brought in to kill the hostages three days before the British entered the city on 18 July. The dismembered bodies were thrown into a deep well nearby. The British, under [[James George Smith Neill|General Neill]], retook the city and committed a series of retaliations against the rebel sepoys and those civilians caught in the area, including women, children and old men. The Cawnpore massacre, as well as similar events elsewhere, were seen by the British as justification for unrestrained vengeance.<ref>[[William Dalrymple (historian)|Dalrymple, W.]] 2007. ''The Last Mughal. The Fall of a Dynasty'': Delhi, 1857, Alfred Knopf, New York</ref> "Remember Cawnpore" became a British war cry for the rest of the war.

Kanpur is located at {{coord|26.449923|N|80.331874|E}} in the central-western part of the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The city lies at a distance of approx 475 km from national-capital [[New Delhi]] and approx 90 km from the state-capital [[Lucknow]]. It is a part of the historical region of [[Awadh]].

Situated in the flat [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]]s, Kanpur has an average elevation of 318 m above sea level.<ref>{{cite web |title=Maps, Weather, and Airports for Kanpur, India |url=https://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/09/Kanpur.html |website=www.fallingrain.com |access-date=22 October 2023}}</ref> The [[Ganges]] flows by the city and several [[ghat]]s are located on its banks, notably the [[Sati Chaura Ghat]] and Sarsaiya Ghat. The Brahmavart Ghat located at [[Bithoor]] (25 km northwards) is another ghat of religious importance.

Several parks and recreational areas are located in Kanpur. [[Nana Rao Park]] and [[Phool Bagh]] are among the prominent parks in city that exist from the time of British Raj. The [[Moti Jheel]], a rectangular lake, was originally developed as a drinking water reservoir. The lake has now been developed as a recreational area with a landscaped garden and a children's park. [[Nawabganj Bird Sanctuary]] is also located near Kanpur.
