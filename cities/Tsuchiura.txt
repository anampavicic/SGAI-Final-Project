==History==
===Prehistory===
Human settlement in the Tsuchiura area dates to the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period. [[Hunter-gatherers]] inhabited the coastal area of the Pacific Ocean (now Lake Kasumigaura) forming large [[shell midden]]s, examples of which can be seen at the Kamitakatsu archeological site. Locals began [[Rice|wet-rice cultivation]], and development of iron and bronze technology, during the [[Yayoi period]]. In the [[Kofun period]] numerous [[Tumulus|Burial mounds]] were constructed in the area. 

===8th century to 19th century===
During the [[Nara period]] the area was organized under the [[Code of Taiho|Taihō Code]] with what is now Tsuchiura occupying four districts of [[Hitachi Province]]. In 939, during the [[Heian period]], [[Taira no Masakado]] led an uprising against the central government by attacking the [[kokufu|provincial capital]] at [[Ishioka, Ibaraki|Ishioka]], a few kilometers to the north of Tsuchiura. 

During the [[Kamakura period]] and the [[Sengoku period]], the area was dominated by several [[samurai]] clans. During the [[Edo period]], part of what is now Tsuchiura was administered as a [[jōkamachi|castle town]] by [[Tsuchiura Domain]], one of the [[han system|feudal domains]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. The area prospered due to its position on the Mito Kaidō, a highway connecting [[Edo]] with [[Mito, Ibaraki|Mito]], and on a canal connecting Lake [[Lake Kasumigaura|Kasumigaura]] to [[Tokyo bay|Edo Bay]].

===Modern period===
With the creation of modern municipalities after the [[Meiji Restoration]] on April 1, 1889, the town of Tsuchiura was established within Ibaraki Prefecture. In 1895 railroad service was started in Tsuchiura. The [[Gothic Revival architecture]] of the old junior high school from this period can be seen at the Dai'ichi high school.

Tsuchiura was elevated to city status when the towns of Manabe and Tsuchiura were merged on November 3, 1940. During [[World War II]] the city suffered damage in an air raid on June 10, 1945. 

On September 1, 1951, Tsuchiura absorbed parts of the village of [[Asahi, Ibaraki|Asahi]] on the shore of Arakawa and also absorbed the village of Towa. The city absorbed the village of Kamiotsu on November 1, 1954. On February 20, 2006, the village of [[Niihari, Ibaraki|Niihari]] (from [[Niihari District, Ibaraki|Niihari District]]) was merged into Tsuchiura.

==Government==
The city is managed by the [[Mayor#Japan|mayor's office]] and the [[city council]] under the [[mayor-council government]] system. The mayor is elected through a citywide election and the members of the city council are elected from districts within the city. The mayor's office is made up of the [[Mayor]], Kiyoshi Nakagawa (中川清), and two Vice Mayors, Hideaki Goto (五頭英明) and Hiroshi Koizumi (小泉祐司). The 28-member city council is headed by [[Chairperson]] Kiyoshi Yaguchi (矢口清). Tsuchiura's political system is similar to that of other cities in Japan, as the [[Local Autonomy Law]] makes all municipalities uniform in powers and organization. 

Tsuchiura sends three members to the Ibaraki Prefectural Assembly. 

Tsuchiura is part of [[Ibaraki 6th district]] for elections to the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Tsuchiura was formerly the center of commerce in southern Ibaraki Prefecture due to its good rail connections and location on Lake Kasumigaura. It was also the location of a major base of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Corps both before and during the war. In the postwar era, the development of the Japanese national highway system, selection of neighboring Tsukuba as a center for government investment and development, and increasing suburbanization has resulted in the closure of many department stores and commercial facilities in the center of the city. The city has several [[industrial parks]]. Present land usage is over 30% agricultural,<ref name="Ibaraki-hp"/> with [[lotus root]] as a famous local crop.

==Education==
*[[Tsukuba International University]]
*Tsuchiura has 16 public elementary schools and seven public middle schools operated by the city government, and five public high school operated by the Ibaraki Prefectural Board of Education. There are also one private elementary school,  one combined middle/high school and three private high schools. The prefecture also operates one special education school for the handicapped.
