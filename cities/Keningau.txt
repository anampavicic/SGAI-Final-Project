== Etymology and history ==
The name ''Keningau'' is derived from the locally-abundant [[Java]]nese [[cinnamon]] tree (''[[Cinnamomum burmannii]]'') which is locally known as ''koningau''. The tree is known as 'Kayu Manis' in Malay and is sometimes referred to as the 'king of [[spice]]s'. Its bark was collected by the [[British North Borneo Company]] to be sold as a spice. During the British colonial era, Keningau was one of the most important administrative centres in [[British North Borneo]].

The Japanese used Keningau as one of its main administrative centres during [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|their occupation of North Borneo in World War II]].
