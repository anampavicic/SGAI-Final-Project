Founded as a [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish]] mission and colonial outpost in 1718, the city in 1731 became the first chartered civil settlement in what is now present-day Texas. The area was then part of the [[Spanish Empire]]. From 1821 to 1836, it was part of the [[Mexico|Mexican Republic]].

At the time of European encounter, the [[Payaya people]] lived near the [[San Antonio River|San Antonio River Valley]] in the [[San Pedro Springs]] area. They called the vicinity ''[[Yanaguana (San Antonio)|Yanaguana]]'', meaning "refreshing waters". In 1691, a group of Spanish explorers and [[missionary|missionaries]] came upon the river and Payaya settlement on June 13, the feast day of [[Anthony of Padua|St. Anthony of Padua]].<ref name=":0" /> They named the place and river "San Antonio" in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Jun2004/Feature2.asp#F1 |title=San Antonio: The City of St. Anthony |work= St. Anthony Messenger Magazine Online |publisher=Americancatholic.org |date= June 2004 |access-date=June 30, 2010}}</ref>

It was years before any Spanish settlement took place. [[Antonio de Olivares|Father Antonio de Olivares]] visited the site in 1709, and he was determined to found a mission and civilian settlement there. The viceroy gave formal approval for a combined mission and presidio in late 1716, as he wanted to forestall any French expansion into the area from their colony of [[Louisiana (New France)|''La Louisiane'']] to the east, as well as prevent illegal trading with the Payaya. He directed [[Martín de Alarcón]], the governor of [[Coahuila y Tejas]], to establish the mission complex. Differences between Alarcón and Olivares resulted in delays, and construction did not start until 1718.<ref name="tshaonline.org" /> Olivares built, with the help of the [[Payaya Indians|Payaya]] and the [[Pastia people]], the [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|Misión de San Antonio de Valero (The Alamo)]], the [[Presidio San Antonio de Bexar]], the bridge that connected both, and the [[Acequia Madre de Valero (San Antonio)|Acequia Madre de Valero]].<ref name="Adina" />

The families who clustered around the presidio and mission were the start of Villa de Béjar, destined to become the most important town in [[Spanish Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/alarcon-martin-de|title=Martin de Alarcon|publisher=Texas State Historical Society|work=Handbook of Texas|last=Chipman|first=Donald E.|access-date=June 23, 2021}}</ref> On May 1, the governor transferred ownership of the Mission San Antonio de Valero (later famous as The Alamo) to Fray Antonio de Olivares.<ref name="Adina" /> On May 5, 1718, he commissioned the Presidio San Antonio de Béxar ("Béjar" in modern Spanish orthography) on the west side of the San Antonio River, one-fourth league from the mission.<ref name="tshaonline.org" />

On February 14, 1719, the Marquis of [[San Miguel de Aguayo, Texas|San Miguel de Aguayo]] proposed to the king of Spain that 400 families be transported from the [[Canary Islands]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], or [[Havana]] to populate the province of Texas. His plan was approved, and notice was given the [[Canary Islanders]] (''[[isleños]]'') to furnish 200 families; the [[Council of the Indies]] suggested that 400 families should be sent from the Canaries to Texas by way of Havana and [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]]. By June 1730, 25 families had reached [[Cuba (island)|Cuba]], and 10 families had been sent to Veracruz before orders from Spain came to stop the re-settlement.<ref name="TXHand" />

Under the leadership of [[Juan Leal Goraz]], the group marched overland from Veracruz to the Presidio San Antonio de Béxar, where they arrived on March 9, 1731. Due to marriages along the way, the party now included 15 families, a total of 56 persons. They joined the military community established in 1718. The immigrants formed the nucleus of the villa of San Fernando de Béxar, the first regularly organized civil government in Texas. Several older families of San Antonio trace their descent from the Canary Island colonists. María Rosa Padrón was the first baby born of Canary Islander descent in San Antonio.<ref name="TXHand" />

[[File:Viceroyalty of New Spain Location 1819 (without Philippines).png|left|thumb|upright=.8|San Antonio was part of the Spanish [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]]. ]]
During the Spanish–Mexican settlement of Southwestern lands, which took place over the following century, Juan Leal Goraz Jr. was a prominent figure. He claimed nearly 100,000 sq miles (153,766 acres) as Spanish territory and held some control for nearly three decades; this area stretched across six present-day states. San Antonio was designated as Leal Goraz's capital. It represented Mexican expansion into the area. With his robust military forces, he led exploration and establishing Spanish colonial bases as far as [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]]. Widespread bankruptcy forced Leal Goraz Jr.'s army back into the current boundaries of Mexico; they fell into internal conflict and turmoil with neighboring entities.

San Antonio grew to become the largest Spanish settlement in Texas; it was designated as the capital of the Spanish, later [[Mexican Texas|Mexican, province of Tejas]]. From San Antonio, the [[Old San Antonio Road|Camino Real]] (today Nacogdoches Road), was built to the small frontier town of [[Nacogdoches]]. Mexico allowed [[European Americans|European American]] settlers from the United States into the territory; they mostly occupied land in the eastern part. In 1835, when [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] unilaterally abolished the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Mexican Constitution of 1824]], violence ensued in many [[states of Mexico]]. which led to many short-lived independent republics.<ref>John H. Jenkins, ed., ''Papers of the Texas Revolution'' (10 vols.; Austin: Presidial Press, 973), p.13</ref> This, in addition to Mexico's abolition of slavery, and cultural differences between the Texians and the Mexicans, led to the [[Texas Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://digital.library.shsu.edu/digital/collection/p243coll3/id/2243/ | title=CONTENTdm }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2013/marchapril/statement/south-freedom | title=South to Freedom }}</ref>

In a series of battles, the [[Texian Army]] succeeded in forcing Mexican soldiers out of the settlement areas east of San Antonio, which were dominated by Americans. Under the leadership of [[Benjamin Milam|Ben Milam]], in the [[Siege of Béxar#Battle|Battle of Bexar]], December 1835, [[Texian]] forces captured San Antonio from forces commanded by General [[Martin Perfecto de Cos]], Santa Anna's brother-in-law. In the spring of 1836, Santa Anna marched on San Antonio. A volunteer force under the command of [[James C. Neill]] occupied and fortified the deserted Alamo mission.<ref name="Papers" />

Upon his departure, the joint command of [[William B. Travis|William Barrett Travis]] and [[James Bowie]] were left in charge of defending the old mission. The [[Battle of the Alamo]] took place from February 23 to March 6, 1836. The outnumbered Texian force was ultimately defeated, with all of the Alamo defenders killed. These men were seen as "martyrs" for the cause of Texas freedom and "Remember the Alamo" became a rallying cry in the Texian Army's eventual success at defeating Santa Anna's army.<ref name="Papers" />

[[Juan Seguín]], who organized the company of [[Tejano]] patriots, who fought for Texas independence, fought at the [[Battle of Concepción]], the [[Siege of Bexar]], and the [[Battle of San Jacinto]], and served as mayor of San Antonio. He was forced out of office due to threats on his life by sectarian newcomers and political opponents in 1842, becoming the last Tejano mayor for nearly 150 years.<ref>Gonzalez, Juan.

In 1845, the United States finally decided to annex Texas and include it as a state in the Union. This led to the [[Mexican–American War]]. Though the U.S. ultimately won, the war was devastating to San Antonio. By its end, the population of the city had been reduced by almost two-thirds, to 800 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=Lewis F.|title=Saving San Antonio: the precarious preservation of a heritage|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|location=Lubbock|year=1996}}</ref> Bolstered by migrants and immigrants, by 1860 at the start of the [[American Civil War]], San Antonio had grown to a city of 15,000 people.

In the 1850s [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], the landscape architect who designed [[Central Park]] in New York City, traveled throughout the Southern and [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] U.S., and published accounts of his observations. In his 1859 book about Texas, Olmsted described San Antonio as having a "jumble of races, costumes, languages, and buildings", which gave it a quality that only [[New Orleans]] could rival in what he described as "odd and antiquated foreignness."<ref>''A Journey Through Texas'', by Frederick Olmsted {{ISBN|978-1-144-80380-1}}</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/journeythroughte01olms Frederick Law Olmsted, ''A Journey through Texas; or, A Saddle-trip on the South-western Frontier: with a statistical appendix'' (1859)], on-line text at Internet Archive</ref>  Following the Civil War, San Antonio prospered as a center of the cattle industry. During this period, it remained a frontier city, with a mixture of cultures that was different from other U.S. cities.

German immigrants founded smaller surrounding towns such as [[New Braunfels, Texas|New Braunfels]], [[Castroville, Texas|Castroville]], [[Boerne, Texas|Boerne]], [[Comfort, Texas|Comfort]], [[Fredericksburg, Texas|Fredericksburg]], and [[Bulverde, Texas|Bulverde]], all towns far out from San Antonio. However, the Germans were then drawn to San Antonio for work, and many buildings and streets still bear German names such as Wurzbach, Huebner, and Jones Maltsberger, and Wiederstein. The German impact on San Antonio was great, in the early 1900s it is estimated that at least 1/3 of San Antonio was ethnically German. Many descendants of German immigrants in San Antonio spoke [[Texas German]] up to the fifth or sixth generations. Texas German is a dialect of German that evolved when the German language was separated from Germany. Texas German is best described as an anglicized-German dialect with a Texas twang. Many older generations in New Braunfels and Fredericksburg still speak Texas German to this day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitsanantonio.com/german-heritage/|title=German Heritage|access-date=May 6, 2020|archive-date=August 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806225430/https://www.visitsanantonio.com/german-heritage/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1877, following the [[Reconstruction Era]], developers constructed the first [[railroad]] to San Antonio, connecting it to major markets and port cities. Texas was the first state to have major cities develop by railroads rather than waterways.{{citation needed|date=November 2023}} In Texas, the railroads supported a markedly different pattern of development of major interior cities, such as San Antonio, [[Dallas]] and [[Fort Worth]], compared to the historical development of coastal port cities in the established eastern states.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the streets of the city's downtown were widened to accommodate street cars and modern traffic. At that time, many of the older historic buildings were demolished in the process of this modernization.<ref>''Saving San Antonio'' by Lewis F. Fisher {{ISBN|978-0-89672-372-6}}</ref>

Since the late twentieth century, San Antonio has had steady [[population growth]]. The city's population has nearly doubled in 35 years, from just over 650,000 in the 1970 census to an estimated 1.2 million in 2005, through both population growth and land annexation (the latter has considerably enlarged the physical area of the city).<ref>{{cite web|title=POPULATION DISTRIBUTION IN 2005|url=https://www.census.gov/population/pop-profile/dynamic/PopDistribution.pdf|website=United States Census Bureau|access-date=June 10, 2017}}</ref> In 1990, the [[United States Census Bureau]] reported San Antonio's population as 55.6% Hispanic or Latino, 7.0% Black or African American, and 36.2% non-Hispanic white.<ref name="census1" />

The San Antonio Missions National Historical Park and The Alamo became [[UNESCO]] World Heritage sites in 2015 and the city was designated a UNESCO "City of Creativity for Gastronomy" in 2017, one of only 26 [[gastronomy]] creative cities in the world.<ref name="PBS-SanAn" />

With the increase in professional jobs, San Antonio has become a destination for many college-educated persons, most recently including African Americans in a [[New Great Migration|reverse Great Migration]] from northern and western areas.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/joelkotkin/2015/01/15/the-cities-where-african-americans-are-doing-the-best-economically/?sh=37007f50164f |title=The cities where African Americans are doing the best economically|first=Joel|last=Kotkin |date=January 16, 2015|access-date=January 16, 2015|newspaper=[[Forbes]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=August 13, 2021|title=Latinos, Blacks Show Strong Growth in San Antonio as White Population Declines|url=https://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/Latinos-Black-communities-grow-in-San-Antonio-16385595.php}}</ref>

=== Crime ===
[[File:San Antonio Police Officers.jpg|thumb|San Antonio police officers]]
Crime in San Antonio began to rise in the early 1980s, similar to many urban areas in the US. In 1983 San Antonio had the tenth highest homicide rate in Texas with 18.5 homicides per 100,000 residents.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/17/us/7-texas-cities-are-in-top-20-in-murder-per-capita.html ''7 Texas Cities are in Top 20 in Murder per Capita'']; New York Times online; accessed April 2017</ref> The number of juveniles arrested in San Antonio for violent crimes tripled between 1987 and 1994, according to the Texas Law Enforcement Management and Administration Statistics Program.

In 1993, San Antonio earned the nickname the "Drive-By City" after the [[San Antonio Police Department]] recorded over 1,200 drive-by shootings, or an average of about 3.5 per day, which overshadowed the number in other Texas cities. A majority of the violence occurred on the east and west sides of the city, especially in areas with high poverty rates. Gang violence led to the deaths of their members and sometimes innocent bystanders, and housing projects such as the [[Alazán-Apache Courts]] served as hubs for various groups, which sometimes included rival gangs.<ref>[http://www.sacurrent.com/sanantonio/drive-by-city-remembering-san-antonio-gang-violence-in-the-1990s/Content?oid=2509008 ''"Drive-by City;" Remembering San Antoinio Gang Violence in the 1990s'']; SA Current; online; retrieved April 2017</ref> By the end of 1993 the city hit a peak in homicides with 230 killings, the highest since 1991 when 211 were killed.<ref>[https://apnews.com/a1b8a394931f8033249fd2f31f9ec951 ''Once Again Homicide Records Fall in Many Big Cities'']; Associated Press News Archive online; accessed April 2017</ref>

===Professional sports===

The city's only top-level professional sports team, and consequently the team most San Antonians follow, is the [[San Antonio Spurs]] of the [[National Basketball Association]]. Previously the Spurs played at the [[Alamodome]] (which was speculatively built in an attempt to lure a professional [[American football|football]] team to the region), and before that the [[HemisFair Arena]]. They moved into the SBC Center in 2002 (since renamed the [[Frost Bank Center]]), built with public funds.

San Antonio is home to the [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[San Antonio Missions]], who play at [[Nelson W. Wolff Municipal Stadium|Nelson Wolff Stadium]] and are the [[Minor League Baseball]] affiliate of the [[San Diego Padres]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/padres/news/padres-announce-minor-league-affiliate-invitations|title=Padres invite 4 teams to be Minors affiliates|website=San Diego padres|publisher=Major League Baseball|date=December 9, 2020|access-date=December 9, 2020}}</ref>
[[File:Soccer Bowl 2014 (17154199041).jpg|thumb|[[Toyota Field]] during the 2014 Soccer Bowl]]
San Antonio had a professional soccer franchise when the [[San Antonio Thunder]] played two seasons in the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|original NASL]] during the 1975–1976 seasons. Professional soccer returned with the birth of the [[San Antonio Scorpions]] of the [[North American Soccer League (2011–2017)|modern NASL]] in 2012. The Scorpions won the [[Soccer Bowl 2014|2014 Soccer Bowl]], the first soccer championship in city history. On December 22, 2015, it was announced that Toyota Field and S.T.A.R. Soccer Complex were sold to the City of San Antonio and Bexar County, a deal which was accompanied by an agreement for [[Spurs Sports and Entertainment]] to operate the facilities and field a team would play in the [[United Soccer League Championship]].

*San Antonio has two [[rugby union]] teams, the [[Alamo City Rugby Football Club]], and San Antonio Rugby Football Club. The San Antonio metropolitan area's smaller population has so far contributed to its lack of an [[National Football League|NFL]], [[MLB]], [[National Hockey League|NHL]], or [[MLS]] team. City officials are said to be attempting to lure the [[National Football League]] permanently to San Antonio.

The city of San Antonio is operated under the [[Council–manager government|council-manager]] system of government. The city is divided into 10 council districts designed to be of equal population. Each district elects one person to the city council, with the mayor elected on a citywide basis. All members of the San Antonio City Council, including the mayor, are elected to two-year terms and are limited to four terms (except for those who were in office in November 2008 and are limited to a total of two terms). [[Houston]] and [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] have similar term limits to San Antonio. All positions are elected on nonpartisan ballots, as required by Texas law. Council members are paid $45,722 and the mayor earns $61,725 a year. The current mayor is [[Ron Nirenberg]], who was elected in [[2017 San Antonio mayoral election|2017]] with 54.59% of the vote.<ref>[http://home.bexar.org/el45a.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614054949/http://home.bexar.org/el45a.htm|date=June 14, 2017}}</ref> Nirenberg was narrowly reelected in [[2019 San Antonio mayoral election|2019]] against conservative challenger Greg Brockhouse.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dimmick |first1=Iris |title=Nirenberg Survives Brockhouse Challenge for Mayor |url=https://therivardreport.com/nirenberg-brockhouse-runoff-election-results-2019/ |website=Rivard Report |access-date=December 30, 2019 |date=June 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bexar.org/DocumentCenter/View/22149/June-8-2019-Media-Report|title=Bexar County, Texas, City of San Antonio – Runoff |website=www.bexar.org |access-date=December 30, 2019}}</ref>

The council effectively functions as the city's legislative body with the city manager acting as its chief executive, responsible for the management of day-to-day operations and execution of council legislation. The current city manager is [[Erik Walsh]].

The city operates its own electric and gas utility, [[CPS Energy]]. The San Antonio Police Department (SAPD) is the city's municipal body of law enforcement. The San Antonio Fire Department (SAFD) provides the city with fire protection and EMS service.

The city stretches into several national congressional districts and is represented in [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] by:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sanantonio.gov/planning/pdf/GIS/map_download/0702GG24.pdf|title=CITY OF SAN ANTONIO|website=Sanantonio.gov}}</ref>

===Growth policy===
[[File:Ahbroadway.jpg|thumb|Broadway Street in [[Alamo Heights, Texas|Alamo Heights]], an enclaved city]]
Unlike most large cities in the U.S., San Antonio is not completely surrounded by independent suburban cities, and under Texas state law it exercises [[extraterritorial jurisdiction]] (ETJ) over much of the surrounding [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] land,<ref>[http://www.sanantonio.gov/planning/pdf/GIS/map_download/0607GT09.pdf Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Boundary (PDF)], City of San Antonio Planning Department.

Retrieved January 7, 2007.</ref>

In the 2000s the city annexed several long narrow corridors along major thoroughfares in outlying areas to facilitate eventual annexation of growth developing along the routes. The city planned to annex nearly 40 additional square miles by 2009.<ref>[http://www.sanantonio.gov/planning/pdf/Comprehensive/three_yr_plan/Three_Yr_Map_01_05_06.pdf ''Three-year Annexation Plan'']; (PDF) format, City of San Antonio Planning Department, January 6, 2006.</ref>

In May 2010, the City of San Antonio agreed to release thousands of acres of land in its extraterritorial jurisdiction along Interstate 10 to [[Schertz]]. The agreement releases a total of {{convert|3486|acre|km2}} of San Antonio's ETJ lands north of I-10 to Schertz. The ETJ lands are in an area bordered by FM 1518 to the west, Lower Seguin Road to the north, Cibolo Creek to the east and I-10 to the south.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/community/northeast/San_Antonio_agrees_to_release_ETJ_to_Schertz.html|title=San Antonio agrees to release ETJ to Schertz|date=May 6, 2010|website=Mysanantonio.com|access-date=July 12, 2018}}</ref>

Involuntary annexation is a controversial issue in those parts of unincorporated Bexar County affected by it. Residents attracted to the outlying areas by lower taxes and affordable real estate values often see annexation as a mechanism to increase [[property tax]] rates (which are primarily driven by school district taxes, not city taxes) without a corresponding improvement in services such as police and fire protection, while the city regards its annexation policy as essential to its overall prosperity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/crime/stories/MYSA031107.01A.Fireresponsetimes.370d0e6.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515130618/http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/crime/stories/MYSA031107.01A.Fireresponsetimes.370d0e6.html|url-status=dead|title=MySA.com: Public Safety|archive-date=May 15, 2008}}</ref>

Since the city has annexed areas over time, San Antonio surrounds several independent [[Inner suburb|enclave cities]], including [[Alamo Heights, Texas|Alamo Heights]], [[Balcones Heights]], [[Castle Hills, Texas|Castle Hills]], [[Hill Country Village, Texas|Hill Country Village]], [[Hollywood Park, Texas|Hollywood Park]], [[Kirby, Texas|Kirby]], [[Leon Valley, Texas|Leon Valley]], [[Olmos Park, Texas|Olmos Park]], [[Shavano Park, Texas|Shavano Park]], and [[Terrell Hills, Texas|Terrell Hills]].

San Antonio has one major newspaper, the ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'', which has served the area since 1865. The ''Express-News'' circulates as the largest newspaper service in [[South Texas]]. The [[Hearst Corporation]], which owned a second newspaper, the ''San Antonio Light'', purchased the ''Express-News'' from [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corp.]] in 1992 and shut down the ''Light'' after failing to find a buyer.

Hearst, using the ''Express-News'' brand, also produces ''Conexión'', a weekly magazine written by an entirely Hispanic and Latin American staff with a Latino spin on weekly events.

===Radio===
About 50 radio stations can be heard in the San Antonio area; 30 of them are in the city proper. San Antonio is home to [[iHeartMedia]], the largest operator of radio stations in the U.S. Its flagship, [[WOAI (AM)|WOAI AM-1200]], is known for its local news operation, considered among the best in the country. It is a 50,000-watt clear channel station that reaches most of North America at night. The first radio station to broadcast in South Texas was [[KTSA|KTSA AM-550]] in 1922.

The region's [[National Public Radio]] member is [[Texas Public Radio]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Texas Public Radio Stations And NPR Launch Collaborative Statewide Newsroom|url=https://www.npr.org/about-npr/759028569/texas-public-radio-stations-and-npr-launch-collaborative-statewide-newsroom|access-date=December 14, 2020|website=NPR.org|date=September 9, 2019 |language=en}}</ref> a group of three stations; KSTX 89.1 FM is NPR news/talk, KPAC 88.3 is a 24-hour classical music station, and KTXI 90.1 is a mix of NPR news/talk and classical music broadcast for the West Central Texas Hill Country. KSTX also broadcasts "Riverwalk Jazz", featuring Jim Cullum Jazz Band at The Landing, a fixture on the River Walk since 1963.

KRTU 91.7 is a non-commercial radio station based at Trinity University.<ref>{{Cite web|title=About KRTU 91.7|url=https://krtu.trinity.edu/about|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209204228/https://krtu.trinity.edu/about|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 9, 2015|access-date=December 14, 2020|website=krtu.trinity.edu}}</ref> Unlike most other college radio stations in the U.S., the station plays jazz 17 hours a day and college rock/indie rock at night. College alternative station KSYM, 90.1 FM, is owned by the Alamo Community College District and operated by San Antonio College students; like KRTU, it plays the Third Coast music network during the day and alternative music at night.

Most Latin American stations in the area play [[Regional styles of Mexican music|regional Mexican]], [[Tejano music|Tejano]] or contemporary pop. On January 12, 2006, [[Univision]]-owned [[KMYO|KMYO-FM]] "La Kalle 95.1" changed its format from Hispanic-Rhythmic Contemporary Hits to Spanish Oldies, then named "Recuerdo 95.1". On November 10, 2006, [[Univision]] flipped KLTO Tejano 97.7's format to [[reggaeton]] in an attempt to reintroduce the format to San Antonio. Then 97.7 was flipped again to feature a rock format. The station no longer broadcasts anything in English. While still owned by Univision, it broadcast music by artists such as [[Linkin Park]], before being sold to the [[Educational Media Foundation]] and flipping once again to [[Air1]].

95.1 was then flipped back to the "La Kalle" format again after being flipped to feature a "95X" format. KLTO was acquired and is operated as a simulcast of [[KVBH|KVBH-FM]] Vibe 107.5. San Antonio radio is diversified, due to an influx of non-[[Tejano]] [[Latinos]], mostly from the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], who serve in the city's various military bases, as well as immigrants from Mexico. Therefore, just like in the rest of the country, radio station conglomerates have been changing formats in San Antonio to reflect shifting [[demographics]].

===Television===
[[File:Building for WOAI channel 4 in San Antonio, Texas.jpg|thumb|WOAI-TV is San Antonio's NBC affiliate.]]

Despite the relatively large size of both the city proper and the metropolitan area, San Antonio has always been a medium-sized market. It presently ranks 33rd in the United States, according to [[marketing research]] firm [[ACNielsen]].<ref>[http://www.nielsenmedia.com/DMAs.html ''Designated Market Areas''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517010320/http://www.nielsenmedia.com/DMAs.html |date=May 17, 2006}}, Nielsen Media Research.</ref> This is mainly because the nearby suburban and rural areas are not much larger than the city itself.

San Antonio-based television stations include [[KCWX]] channel 2 ([[MyNetworkTV]]), [[WOAI-TV|WOAI]] channel 4 ([[NBC]], with [[The CW|CW]] on DT2), [[KENS]] channel 5 ([[CBS]]), [[KLRN]] channel 9 ([[PBS]]), [[KSAT-TV|KSAT]] channel 12 ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), [[KNIC-DT]] channel 17 ([[UniMás]]), [[KABB]] channel 29 ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]]), KVDF-CD channel 31 ([[Azteca América]]), [[KMYS]] channel 35 ([[Dabl]]), [[KWEX-DT]] channel 41 ([[Univision]]) and [[KVDA]] channel 60 ([[Telemundo]]). The market is also home to three religious stations, three independent stations and one [[Internet radio|Internet-based station]] (210 TV<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.210TV.com/|title=210 TV, San Antonio's First Internet Television Network|website=210tv.com}}</ref>). {{As of|2010}}, the San Antonio market has 65% [[cable TV]] penetration.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}

===Mass transit===
{{Further|VIA Metropolitan Transit}}
[[File:San Antonio Intersection.JPG|thumb|A VIA bus, stopped at a Downtown San Antonio intersection]]
A bus system is provided by the city's metropolitan transit authority, [[VIA Metropolitan Transit]]. VIA began operating a [[bus rapid transit]] line known as [[VIA Primo]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.viabrt.net/ |title=Destination 2012 |access-date=November 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201083147/http://www.viabrt.net/ |archive-date=December 1, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> in December 2012, which connects [[Downtown San Antonio]] to the [[South Texas Medical Center]], the main campus of the [[University of Texas at San Antonio]], and the independent enclave city of [[Leon Valley, Texas|Leon Valley]]. Additionally, VIA also offers VIAtrans [[Paratransit]] Service,<ref>{{Cite web|title=VIAtrans Paratransit Service|url=https://www.viainfo.net/viatrans-paratransit/|access-date=July 14, 2021|website=VIA Metropolitan Transit|language=en-US}}</ref> a wheelchair accessible ride-share service for people with disabilities.

In August 2010, VIA Metropolitan Transit unveiled buses that are powered by diesel-electric hybrid technology.<ref name="viainfo.net" /> The 30 hybrid buses were put into service on VIA's express routes to serve daily commuters across the city. This set of buses follows the introduction of new vehicles powered by compressed natural gas, which were unveiled in May 2010. In the fall of 2010, VIA took delivery of three new buses that are powered by electricity from on-board batteries. These buses serve the Downtown core area, and are the first revenue vehicles VIA operates which have zero emissions.<ref name="viainfo.net" />

VIA offers 90 regular bus routes and two Downtown streetcar routes.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bus Services|url=https://www.viainfo.net/bus-schedules/|access-date=December 23, 2020|website=VIA Metropolitan Transit|language=en-US}}</ref> This includes express service from Downtown to park and ride locations in the south, west, northwest, north central and northeast sides of the city, with service to major locations such as [[University of Texas at San Antonio|UTSA]], Six Flags Fiesta Texas and [[SeaWorld]]. VIA also offers a special service to city events including [[San Antonio Spurs|Spurs]] games and city parades from its park and ride locations.

San Antonio became the largest American city without an intra-city rail system when [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], the former largest city without such a system, [[Valley Metro Rail|procured one in 2008]]. A proposed passenger rail line, Lone Star Rail, would have linked San Antonio to Austin, but was cancelled in 2016 after 19 years of planning.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.kut.org/post/campo-vote-derails-lone-star-rail-project|title=CAMPO Vote Derails Lone Star Rail Project|last=Maas|first=Jimmy|date=October 18, 2016|work=KUT News|access-date=January 23, 2020|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705003943/http://kut.org/post/campo-vote-derails-lone-star-rail-project|archive-date=July 5, 2018}}</ref>

A large portion of trade between Mexico and the United States passes through the San Antonio area's interstate highway system.<ref>{https://www.expressnews.com/business/article/booming-port-laredo-puts-san-antonio-in-heart-18507293.php|title=Booming Port of Laredo a linchpin in global trade, and San Antonio's 'right in the heart of it}</ref>

Of the five largest cities in Texas, San Antonio (within city limits) is the largest city in the state without toll roads.  (Houston, Dallas, Austin, and Fort Worth have toll roads.)

San Antonio enjoys less traffic congestion than other large Texas cities.

===Walkability===
{{As of|2021}}, [[Walk Score]] ranks San Antonio as the least [[Walkability|walkable]] American city a population greater than one million and calls it car-dependent.
