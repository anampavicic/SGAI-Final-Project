===Climate===

== Education ==
Wad Madani provides for a range of educational institutions on four levels of education. Starting from [[kindergarten]] and day-care centres, on to [[Primary school|primary or elementary schools]], and until [[secondary school]]s. For [[higher education]], there are two universities, the [[University of Gezira]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/arab-region-universities/search?country=sudan&page=2|title=universities list by region}}</ref> and [[Wad Medani Ahlia University]].

== Cultural life ==
In an article about the rise and decline of cinema in the city of Wad Madani, the popularity of "going to the movies" was explained in terms of its importance for public cultural life, providing a "fresh breath of freedom in light of the country’s independence." For many urban dwellers, movie shows were the only public forms of entertainment at the time. This applied both to educated and less educated people, as well as to women and girls, who were admitted as families in the company of their male relatives.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Gamal|first=Alaa|date=2021-07-01|title=Memory of Places (Part 1 of 2)|url=https://andariya.com/post/memory-of-places-part-1-of-2/?fbclid=IwAR2qY0ts7D02Tv0ErI-PRko8fTLLHm6hfNdrhqzXRv7fGmAcF55n3WWN6iE|access-date=2021-07-05|website=andariya.com}}</ref>

In a provincial town like Wad Madani, film shows started in the early 1950s in the form of [[mobile cinema]]s. This type of film show was presented in different neighbourhoods by the Ministry of Information by means of automobiles that could provide for a screen and a projector, managed by a specialised [[projectionist]]. Later, dedicated [[outdoor cinema]]s were built for regular shows, and in the 1970s, there were six such cinemas in Wad Madani. The films included [[Arab cinema|Arab]], [[Cinema of India|Indian]] and other foreign films, for example "[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner|Guess who’s Coming to Dinner"]] or "[[War and Peace (1956 film)|War and Peace]]" and chosen by the 'Sudanese Cinema Institution' under the Ministry of Information. Also, international [[News broadcasting|news broadcasts]], for example by the [[BBC]], were included. [[Censorship]] was exercised by special committees in order to protect social cultural values, but still with respect to the plot and artistic character of the films. Such evenings spent at the cinema "sparked heated discussions about the films being screened that carried on long after the film ended, in social occasions that brought communities together."<ref name=":0" />

Starting in the 1970s, the spread of [[television]] and, more importantly, new taxes and restrictive laws, introduced in September 1983 by the Islamist government under [[Jaafar Nimeiry]] and followed by stricter censorship, led to the decline of cinemas that became gradually abandoned and derelict. Frequent cinema goers turned away from the films that could still be shown, as these performances no longer provided "a space for their rebellion against issues afflicting internal and external societies such as [[racism]], [[injustice]] and [[politics]]."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gamal|first=Alaa|date=2021-07-04|title=Memory of Places (Part 2 of 2) by Alaa Gamal|url=https://andariya.com/post/memory-of-places-2-2|access-date=2021-07-05|website=andariya.com}}</ref>
