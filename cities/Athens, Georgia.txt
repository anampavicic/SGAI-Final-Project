'''Athens''' is a [[consolidated city-county]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

The city is also known as a recording site for such groups as the Atlanta-based [[Indigo Girls]].

==History==
[[File:Franklin House (Athens, Georgia) 1936 Historic American Buildings Survey.jpg|275px|thumb|left|Historic American Buildings of Athens in 1936]]
In the late 18th century, a trading settlement on the banks of the [[Oconee River]] called Cedar Shoals stood where Athens is today.<ref>Easom, Maxine Pinson, Patsy Hawkins Arnold, and Gary L. Doster. ''Across the River: The People, Places, and Culture of East Athens.'' 2019.</ref> On January 27, 1785, the [[Georgia General Assembly]] granted a [[charter]] by [[Abraham Baldwin]] for the [[University of Georgia]] as the first [[public university|state-supported university]]. Georgia's control of the area was established following the [[Oconee War]]. In 1801, a committee from the university's board of [[trustee]]s selected a site for the university on a hill above Cedar Shoals, in what was then [[Jackson County, Georgia|Jackson County]]. On July 25, 1801, [[John Milledge]], one of the trustees and later governor of Georgia, bought 633 acres from Daniel Easley and donated it to the university. Milledge named the surrounding area [[Athens]] after the city that was home to the [[Platonic Academy]] of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] in [[Classical Greece]].<ref>Hynds, Ernest C. (1974; 2009 ed.). [https://books.google.com/books?id=F3jXcKhBqnsC&pg=PA2 ''Antebellum Athens and Clarke County, Georgia''], pp. 2-4. University of Georgia Press.</ref>
[[File:Athens, Georgia City Hall 2008.jpg|275px|thumb|left|City Hall on College Avenue in Downtown Athens, seen across Washington Street]] The first buildings on the University of Georgia campus were [[Log building|made from logs]]. The town grew as lots adjacent to the college were sold to raise money for the additional construction of the school. By the time the first class graduated from the university in 1804, Athens consisted of three homes, three stores, and a few other buildings facing Front Street, now known as Broad Street. Completed in 1806 and named in honor of [[Benjamin Franklin]], Franklin College was the first permanent structure of the University of Georgia and the city of Athens. This brick building is now known as Old College.

Athens officially became a town in December 1806 with a government made up of a three-member commission.<ref>Hynds 1974, p. 9.</ref> The university and town continued to grow with [[cotton mill]]s fueling the industrial and commercial development. Athens became known as the "[[Manchester]] of the South" after the city in England known for its mills. In 1833 a group of Athens businessmen led by James Camak, tired of their wagons getting stuck in the mud, built one of Georgia's first railroads, the [[Georgia Railroad|Georgia]], connecting Athens to [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]] by 1841, and to Marthasville (now [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]) by 1845. In the 1830s and 1840s, transportation developments and the growing influence of the University of Georgia made Athens one of the state's most important cities as the Antebellum Period neared the height of its development. The university essentially created a chain reaction of growth in the community which developed on its doorstep.<ref>''Antebellum Athens and Clarke County, Georgia'', By Ernest C. Hynds, p. 41</ref>

During the [[American Civil War]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stegeman|first1=John F.|title=These men she gave : Civil War diary of Athens, Georgia|date=1964|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens|isbn=9780820334585|url=http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/ugapressbks/do-pdf:ugp9780820334585|access-date=February 21, 2018}}</ref> Athens became a significant supply center when the New Orleans armory was relocated to what is now called the Chicopee building. Fortifications can still be found along parts of the North Oconee River between College Avenue and Oconee Street. In addition, Athens played a small part in the ill-fated "Stoneman Raid" when a skirmish was fought on a site overlooking the Middle Oconee River near what is now the old Macon Highway.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Seibert|first1=David|title=The Stoneman Raid|url=http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/clarke/the-stoneman-raid11|website=GeorgiaInfo: an Online Georgia Almanac|publisher=Digital Library of Georgia|access-date=November 9, 2016}}</ref> A [[Athens Confederate Monument|Confederate memorial]] that used to stand on Broad Street near the University of Georgia Arch was removed the week of August 10, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Aued|first1=Blake|title=Athens-Clarke County Starts Removing Confederate Monument|url=https://flagpole.com/news/in-the-loop/2020/08/13/athens-clarke-county-starts-removing-confederate-monument|website=Flagpole: The Colorbearer of Athens, Georgia|date=August 13, 2020|publisher=Flagpole Magazine|access-date=October 4, 2020}}</ref>

During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], Athens continued to grow. The form of government changed to a mayor-council government with a new city charter on August 24, 1872, and Henry Beusse was elected as the first mayor of Athens.<ref>Thomas, Frances Taliaferro (2nd ed. 2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=o-8jFTZDrIwC&pg=PA293 ''A Portrait of Historic Athens and Clarke County''], p. 293. University of Georgia Press.</ref> Beusse was instrumental in the city's rapid growth after the Civil War. After serving as mayor, he worked in the railroad industry and helped bring railroads to the region, creating growth in many of the surrounding communities. Freed slaves moved to the city, where many were attracted by the new centers for education such as the [[Freedmen's Bureau]]. This new population was served by three black newspapers: the ''Athens Blade'', the ''Athens Clipper'', and the ''Progressive Era''.<ref>Thomas 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=o-8jFTZDrIwC&pg=PA115 pp. 115-17].</ref>

In the 1880s, as Athens became more densely populated, city services and improvements were undertaken. The Athens [[Police]] Department was founded in 1881 and [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] opened in the fall of 1886. Telephone service was introduced in 1882 by the [[Bell Telephone Company]]. Transportation improvements were also introduced with a street paving program beginning in 1885 and [[streetcar]]s, pulled by mules, in 1888.

[[File:AthensGeorgiaStreetScene2008 05 s 03.jpg|275px|thumb|left|Broad Street in Downtown Athens at an entrance to North Campus of the [[University of Georgia]]]]
By the centennial in 1901, Athens had experienced a century of development and growth. A new [[city hall]] was completed in 1904. An [[African-American]] [[middle class]] and the professional class grew around the corner of Washington and Hull Streets, known as the "Hot Corner", where the Morton Building was constructed in 1910.<ref>Doster, Emily Jean & Doster, Gary L. (2011). [https://books.google.com/books?id=cQaMPnfjoiQC&pg=PA98 ''Athens''], pp. 98-99. Arcadia Publishing.</ref> The theater at the Morton Building hosted movies and performances by black musicians such as [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Cab Calloway]], and [[Duke Ellington]]. In 1907 aviation pioneer [[Ben T. Epps]] became Georgia's first pilot on a hill outside town that would become the [[Athens-Ben Epps Airport]].

The last, and perhaps only, lynching in Athens occurred on February 16, 1921, when a mob of 3,000 people attacked the Athens courthouse and carried off John Lee Eberhart. Eberhart had been arrested for the murder of his employer, Ida D. Lee, with a shotgun in Oconee County. That night he was driven back to the Lee farm where a mock trial was held. Though he refused to confess, he was tied to a stake and burned to death. The lynching received widespread attention.<ref name="UGA">{{cite web |title=THE LYNCHING PROJECT: OCONEE COUNTY |url=https://digihum.libs.uga.edu/exhibits/show/the-lynching-project--murder-a/georgia-historic-overview/oconee-county |website=African American Experience in Athens |publisher=University of Georgia |access-date=6 September 2020 |archive-date=June 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200622012802/https://digihum.libs.uga.edu/exhibits/show/the-lynching-project--murder-a/georgia-historic-overview/oconee-county |url-status=dead }}</ref>

During [[World War II]], the [[U.S. Navy]] built new buildings and paved runways to serve as a training facility for naval pilots. In 1954, the U.S. Navy chose Athens as the site for the [[Navy Supply Corps]] school. The school was in [[Normaltown]] in the buildings of the old [[State Normal School (Athens, Georgia)|Normal School]]. It closed in 2011 under the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] process. The 56 acre site is now home to the Health Sciences Campus, which contains the University of Georgia/Medical College of Georgia Medical Partnership, the University of Georgia College of Public Health, and other health-related programs.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Location & Facilities |url=https://publichealth.uga.edu/cph/location-and-facilities/ |access-date=2024-03-21 |website=College of Public Health UGA |language=en-US}}</ref>

In 1961, Athens witnessed part of the civil rights movement when [[Charlayne Hunter-Gault|Charlayne Hunter]] and [[Hamilton E. Holmes|Hamilton Holmes]] became the first two black students to enter the University of Georgia.<ref>Dyer, Thomas G. (1985).[https://archive.org/details/universityofgeor0000dyer/page/329 ''The University of Georgia: A Bicentennial History, 1785–1985''], p. 329. University of Georgia Press.</ref> Despite the ''[[Brown vs. Board of Education]]'' [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] ruling in 1954, the Athens–Clarke County school district remained segregated until 1964.

As of the [[census]]<ref name="GR2" /> of 2010, there were 100,266 people, 39,239 households, and 19,344 families residing in the city. The population density was {{convert|851.5|PD/sqmi|PD/km2|sp=us|adj=off}}. There were 41,633 housing units at an average density of {{convert|353.6|/mi2|/km2|disp=preunit|units&nbsp;|units|}}.

[[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 6.39% of the population.

The large population increase from 1990 to 2000 reflects the city's expanded boundaries that came with the consolidation of Athens and Clarke County, and not merely an influx of new residents. Since that time the population has increased an average of 12.7% every ten years.

There were 39,239 households, of which 22.3% had children under 18 living with them, 32.3% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 13.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 50.7% were non-families. 29.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.35 and the average family size was 2.95.

In the city, 17.8% of the population was under the age of 18, 31.6% was from 18 to 24, 27.3% from 25 to 44, 15.3% from 45 to 64, and 8.0% was 65 years of age or older. The median age was 25 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.4 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $28,118, and the median income for a family was $41,407. Males had a median income of $30,359 versus $23,039 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the balance was $17,103. About 15.0% of families and 28.6% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 25.2% of those under age 18 and 13.5% of those age 65 or over.

The SR&nbsp;10 Loop serves as a [[Limited-access road|limited-access]] perimeter. The city is bisected east to west by Broad Street/Atlanta Highway (US&nbsp;78 Bus. and SR&nbsp;10) and north to south by Milledge Avenue (SR&nbsp;15 Alt.). Lumpkin Street, Prince Avenue (SR&nbsp;15 Alt.), North Avenue, and Oconee Street (US&nbsp;78 Bus.) along with Broad Street are major thoroughfares radiating from [[Downtown (Athens)|downtown]]. College Station Road and Gaines School Road are major thoroughfares on the east side of Athens, along with US&nbsp;78 east (Lexington Road). On the west side, most major thoroughfares intersect US&nbsp;78 Bus. (Broad Street/Atlanta Highway), including Alps Road/Hawthorne Avenue, Epps Bridge Parkway, and Timothy Road/Mitchell Bridge Road.

====Airports====
[[Athens-Ben Epps Airport]] (FAA code AHN) has been operational since 1917. It is east of downtown outside [[Georgia State Route 10 Loop (Athens)|Georgia State Route 10 Loop]] and north of [[US Route 78]]. AHN qualifies for air service to be provided under the [[Essential Air Service]] provisions. [[SeaPort Airlines]] provides commercial air service to [[Nashville International Airport]], TN. Until 2012, [[Georgia Skies]] and Wings Air provided commercial air service to [[Atlanta]], and until 2008 (before either airline's current AHN service), [[US Airways]] provided service to [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]. [[Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport]] (ATL) is the primary point of departure and arrival for Athenians due to the relative lack of air service to AHN.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athensairport.net/ |title=Athens-Ben Epps Airport |publisher=Athensairport.net |access-date=August 14, 2010}}</ref>

====Alternative transportation====
Athens encourages the use of alternative transportation. Bike lanes are provided on major thoroughfares. A rail-to-trail redevelopment is being considered to connect [[Downtown (Athens)|Downtown]] with the East Side. Organizations such as [[BikeAthens]] support and encourage biking. Skateboarding and small scooters are also common sights around the UGA campus and Downtown.

====Rail====
Athens has no direct passenger rail service; the closest [[Amtrak]] stations are in [[Peachtree Station|Atlanta]], [[Gainesville, Georgia (Amtrak station)|Gainesville]], and [[Toccoa (Amtrak station)|Toccoa]].

Electric service in Athens-Clarke is provided by three customer-owned electric cooperatives, Walton EMC, Rayle EMC, and [[Jackson Electric Membership Corporation|Jackson EMC]], as well as by [[Georgia Power]], a subsidiary of [[Southern Company]]. The water utility is provided by the city. Garbage is provided by private companies according to customer purchase, though the city does offer municipal garbage pick up as a service. [[Natural gas]] is supplied by [[Atlanta Gas Light]] through various marketers within the deregulated market.

===Healthcare===
Athens is served by two major hospitals, the 359-bed [[Piedmont Athens Regional]] and the 170-bed St. Mary's Hospital.<ref>{{Cite web|title=St. Mary's Hospital - Emergency Department {{!}} Athens, GA|url=https://www.stmaryshealthcaresystem.org/locations/st-marys-hospital|access-date=2020-11-09|website=www.stmaryshealthcaresystem.org|language=en}}</ref> The city is also served by the smaller 42-bed Landmark Hospital of Athens.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Critical Care Hospital Athens, GA {{!}} Landmark Hospital of Athens, GA|url=https://www.landmarkhospitals.com/critical-care-hospital-system/critical-care-hospital-athens-ga/|access-date=2020-11-09|website=Landmark Hospitals|language=en-US}}</ref> Piedmont Athens Regional was formerly Athens Regional Medical Center before being acquired by Piedmont Healthcare in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|title=A System of Better Care Across Georgia {{!}} Piedmont Healthcare|url=https://www.piedmont.org/about-piedmont-healthcare/quickfacts|access-date=2020-11-09|website=www.piedmont.org}}</ref> In March 2018, Piedmont Healthcare announced a $171 million capital investment project for Piedmont Athens Regional which would include the addition of a fourth story to the Prince 2 building<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-06-12|title=Piedmont Athens Regional {{!}} Master Facility Plan|url=https://www.dpr.com/projects/piedmont-athens-regional-hospital-patient-tower-enabling-work|access-date=2020-11-09|website=DPR Construction|language=en}}</ref> as well as the demolition of the 100-year-old 1919 Tower to make space for a new, state of the art, seven-story tower.

St. Mary's Hospital was founded in 1906 and became a Catholic hospital in 1938. The hospital became St. Mary's Health Care System in 1993. Today, St. Mary's is part of the [[Trinity Health (Livonia, Michigan)|Trinity Health]], one of the nation's largest non-profit Catholic healthcare systems that includes 92 hospitals in 22 states and includes St. Mary's Hospital in Athens, and nearby 56-bed St. Mary's Sacred Heart Hospital in Lavonia, Ga., and 25-bed St. Mary's Good Samaritan Hospital in Greensboro, Ga.
