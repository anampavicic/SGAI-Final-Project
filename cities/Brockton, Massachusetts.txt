Along with [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]], it is one of the two [[county seat]]s of [[Plymouth County, Massachusetts|Plymouth County]].<ref name="GR6">{{cite web |url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |access-date=2011-06-07 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210815/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archive-date=2011-05-31 }}</ref> It is the sixth-largest city in Massachusetts and is sometimes referred to as the "City of Champions", due to the success of native boxers [[Rocky Marciano]] and [[Marvin Hagler]], as well as its successful [[Brockton High School]] sports programs. Two villages within it are [[Montello (MBTA station)|Montello]] and [[Campello (MBTA station)|Campello]], both of which have [[MBTA Commuter Rail|MBTA Commuter Rail Stations]] and post offices. Campello is the smallest neighborhood, but also the most populous. Brockton hosts a baseball team, the [[Brockton Rox]].

==History==

In 1649, Ousamequin ([[Massasoit]]) sold the surrounding [[Wampanoag]] land—then known as Saughtucket—to [[Myles Standish]] as an addition to [[Duxbury, Massachusetts|Duxbury]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cline |first=Sara |title=Massasoit and Myles Standish signed it -- Bridgewater saved it |url=https://www.enterprisenews.com/story/news/2017/09/08/massasoit-myles-standish-signed-it/18853923007/ |access-date=2023-04-15 |website=Enterprise News |language=en-US}}</ref> Brockton was part of this area, which [[Colonial history of the United States|the English]] renamed [[Bridgewater, Massachusetts|Bridgewater]].  On June 15, 1821, a portion of the then Bridgewater Township was established as North Bridgewater.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.familysearch.org/library/books/records/item/388219-vital-records-of-bridgewater-massachusetts-to-the-year-1850-vol-1|title=Vital Records of Bridgewater, Massachusetts to the year 1850|publisher=New England Historic Genealogical Society|year=1916|editor-last=Scott|editor-first=Henry Edwards|volume=1 - Births|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=3|access-date=19 Nov 2021|url-access=registration}}</ref>  Brockton is named after [[Isaac Brock]]. He was the British commanding general at [[Battle of Queenston Heights|Queenston Heights]]—the first major battle of the [[War of 1812]]—where invading American troops retreated in defeat. Because Brock was a [[Loyalism|loyalist]], naming the town after him was a subject of contention among its colonial residents. Ultimately, it was given the name Brockton in 1874, and officially became a [[city]] on April 9, 1881.

Brockton was a stop on the [[Underground Railroad]], a network of secret routes and safe houses that helped enslaved people escape to freedom in the North and Canada.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Black history comes alive in the hands and voices of prominent Brocktonians |url=https://www.enterprisenews.com/story/news/history/2023/02/10/brockton-black-history-month-naacp-library-martin-luther-king-malcolm-x-kamala-harris-harriet-tubman/69873734007/ |access-date=2023-04-15 |website=Enterprise News |language=en-US}}</ref>  Famous [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] [[Frederick Douglass]], spoke to a crowd at the Liberty Tree in Brockton during the pre-Civil War period.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Saint-Ciel |first=Alisha |title=5 influential African Americans with ties to Brockton area |url=https://www.enterprisenews.com/story/news/local/2021/02/18/african-american-brockton-west-bridgewater-frederick-douglass-jacob-talbot-eugene-marrow-mary-baker/6781214002/ |access-date=2023-04-15 |website=Enterprise News |language=en-US}}</ref> During the [[American Civil War]], Brockton was America's largest producer of shoes, and until the latter parts of the 20th century, Brockton had a large shoe and leather products industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/x1959832707/Once-known-as-Shoe-City-Brockton-loses-its-last-factory|title=Once known as 'Shoe City,' Brockton loses its last factory|first=Elaine|last=Allegrini}}</ref>

Since the company's 1898 founding, Brockton has been the headquarters city of [[office supplies]] retailer [[W.B. Mason]], itself founded to provide those supplies to the city's shoe industry. The city's economy was once based on the shoe industry, but it has since diversified to include other industries such as healthcare, education, and manufacturing. Brockton has faced a number of challenges, including poverty, crime, and regional and local racial segregation.<ref name=":0">[https://www.bostonindicators.org/-/media/indicators/boston-indicators-reports/report-files/changing-faces-2019/indicators-changing-facesf2web.pdf Boston Indicators Project, 2018, pp. 37-40]</ref> Despite these challenges, the city has made progress in recent years,<ref name=":0" /> particularly in the development of its downtown area, by highlighting its diversity and rich history, and working toward a more welcoming atmosphere for businesses and residents.<ref>{{Citation |last=CityBrockton |title=Brockton: Where Better Begins |date=2022-11-09 |url=https://vimeo.com/769246635 |access-date=2023-04-15}}</ref>

===Historical firsts===

====World firsts====

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|21.6|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|21.5|sqmi|km2}}  is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} (0.56%) is water. Brockton is the 162nd largest city by land area in the Commonwealth, and the twelfth largest of the twenty-seven towns in Plymouth County. Brockton is bordered by [[Stoughton, Massachusetts|Stoughton]] to the northwest, [[Avon, Massachusetts|Avon]] to the north, [[Holbrook, Massachusetts|Holbrook]] to the northeast, [[Abington, Massachusetts|Abington]] to the northeast, [[Whitman, Massachusetts|Whitman]] and [[East Bridgewater, Massachusetts|East Bridgewater]] to the southeast, [[West Bridgewater, Massachusetts|West Bridgewater]] to the south, and [[Easton, Massachusetts|Easton]] to the west. Brockton is approximately 25 miles south of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], and 30 miles northeast of [[Providence, Rhode Island]].

Brockton is mostly an urban setting, lying along the [[Salisbury Plain River]], which once powered the many shoe factories of the city. To the northeast lies the Beaver Brook Conservation Land, attached to the southern end of the [[Ames Nowell State Park]] in [[Abington, Massachusetts|Abington]]. There are several parks throughout the city, but the largest is [[D.W. Field Park]], an [[Frederick Law Olmsted|Olmsted]]-inspired park which includes ponds, Waldo Lake and Brockton Reservoir in Avon, as well as a golf course.

===Climate===
According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Brockton has either a [[Humid continental climate#Hot summer subtype|hot-summer humid continental climate]] (abbreviated ''Dfa''), or a hot-summer [[Humid subtropical climate|humid sub-tropical climate]] (abbreviated ''Cfa''), depending on the isotherm used.
