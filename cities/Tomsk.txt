'''Tomsk''' ({{langx|ru|Томск}}, {{IPA|ru|tomsk|IPA}}; {{langx|sty|Түң-тора}}) is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] and the [[administrative center]] of [[Tomsk Oblast]] in [[Russia]], on the [[Tom (river)|Tom River]]. Population: {{ru-census|p2021=556,478|p2010=524,669|p2002=487,838|p1989=501,963}}

Founded in 1604, Tomsk is one of the oldest cities in [[Siberia]]. It has six universities, with over 100,000 students, including [[Tomsk State University]], the oldest university in Siberia.<ref>''A Geography of Russia and Its Neighbors'' {{ISBN|978-1-606-23933-9}} p. 398</ref>

==History==
[[File:FoundingSpotTomsk.jpg|160px|thumb|left|The "Where Tomsk was Founded" marker at the Tomsk History Museum.]]

[[File: Siberian State Medical University.jpg |thumb|[[Siberian State Medical University]]]]

Tomsk originated with a decree by [[Tsar]] [[Boris Godunov]] in 1604 after {{Interlanguage link multi|Toian|ru|3=Тоян}}, the [[Siberian Tatars|Tatar]] duke of {{Interlanguage link multi|Eushta (village)|lt=Eushta|ru|3=Эушта}}, asked for the Tsar's protection against [[Yenisei Kirghiz|Kyrgyz]].<ref name="hrono1600">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrono.ru/1600tomsk.html |title=Томская Хроника XVII—XVIII вв. |publisher=Хронос.

Toian ceded the land for the fortress to the Tsar.<ref name="gen_commersant">[http://www.kommersant.com/t-72/r_5/n_416/Tomsk_Region/ General Information about Tomsk, Kommersant Daily] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207013219/http://www.kommersant.com/t-72/r_5/n_416/Tomsk_Region/ |date=February 7, 2007 }}</ref>

In 1804, the [[Imperial Russian government]] selected Tomsk as the seat of the new [[Tomsk Governorate]], which would include the modern cities of [[Novosibirsk]], [[Kemerovo]], and [[Krasnoyarsk]], as well as the territories now in Eastern [[Kazakhstan]]. The new status brought development and the city grew quickly.<ref name="gen_commersant" />

The discovery of [[gold]] in 1830 brought further development to Tomsk in the 19th century; however, when in the 1890s the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] bypassed the city in favor of the village of Novonikolayevsk (Novosibirsk), development began to move south to connect with the railway. In time, [[Novosibirsk]] would surpass Tomsk in importance.

In the mid-19th century one fifth of the city's residents were [[exile]]s. However, within a few years, the city reinvented itself as the educational center of Siberia with the establishment of [[Tomsk State University]], founded in 1880, and [[Tomsk Polytechnic University]], founded in 1896. By [[World War II]], every twelfth resident of the city was a student,<ref name="gen_commersant" /> giving rise to the city's nickname, the ''Siberian [[Athens]]''.

After the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, the city became a notable center of the [[White movement]], led by [[Anatoly Pepelyayev]] and [[Maria Bochkareva]], among others. After the victory of the [[Red Army]] in the 1920s, Soviet authorities incorporated Tomsk into the [[West Siberian Krai]] and later into [[Novosibirsk Oblast]].

Like many Siberian cities, Tomsk became the new home for many factories relocated out of the war zone from 1941. The resulting growth of the city led the Soviet government to establish the new Tomsk Oblast, with Tomsk serving as the administrative center.<ref name="gen_commersant" />

During the [[Cold War]], Tomsk became one of many designated [[closed city|closed cities]],{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} which outsiders and, in particular, foreigners, could not visit. In 1949 matters went a stage further with the establishment of a secret city, known as "Tomsk-7<ref>{{Cite web |title=Village of Georgiyevka - Tomsk-7 Victims Documentation (Russia: 2005) |url=https://media.greenpeace.org/archive/Village-of-Georgiyevka---Tomsk-7-Victims-Documentation--Russia--2005--27MZIFLLW8YV.html |access-date=7 October 2024 |website=Greenpeace Media}}</ref>" (or sometimes simply as "Postbox 5") {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=off}} north-west of Tomsk; the new settlement became the home of the [[Sibirskaya Nuclear Power Plant|Tomsk Nuclear Plant]] (subsequently renamed the Sibirskaya Nuclear Power Plant), the [[Soviet Union]]'s first industrial-scale nuclear-power station. Tomsk-7 received municipal status in 1956 and was renamed [[Seversk]] in 1992.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Tomsk serves as the [[administrative center]] of the [[oblast]] and, within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it also serves as the administrative center of [[Tomsky District]], even though it is not  a part of it.<ref name="Ref267">Law #271-OZ</ref> As an administrative division, it is, together with seven [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|rural localities]], incorporated separately as '''Tomsk [[City of federal subject significance|City Under Oblast Jurisdiction]]'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Tomsk Oblast|districts]].<ref name="Ref267" /> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], Tomsk City Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as '''Tomsk Urban Okrug'''.<ref name="Ref897">Law #238-OZ</ref>

===City divisions===
Tomsk is divided into four city districts: Kirovsky, Leninsky, Oktyabrsky, and Sovetsky.

==Climate==
Tomsk has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') barely escaping a [[subarctic]] classification. The annual average temperature is {{convert|+1.2|C}}. Winters are severe and lengthy, and the lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|-55|C}} in January 1931. However, the average temperature in January is between {{convert|-21|C}} and {{convert|-13|C}}. The average temperature in July is {{convert|+18.8|C}}. The total annual rainfall is {{convert|587|mm|sp=us}}. In 2006, Tomsk experienced what might have been its first recorded winds of hurricane force, which toppled trees and damaged houses.<ref name="pogoda_tomsk">[http://pogoda.ru.net/climate/29430.htm Погода и климат - Климат Томска (Weather and climate - Climate of Tomsk)]</ref>

Tomsk is governed by a mayor and a 33-member [[Duma of Tomsk|Duma]]. The current mayor, appointed in 2013, is [[Ivan Klyayn]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.admin.tomsk.ru/pgsml/08|title=Official Portal of "The city of Tomsk"|website=en.admin.tomsk.ru|access-date=January 1, 2018}}</ref> a member of The [[United Russia]] party.

Of the 33 members, 16 are elected from the eight [[Plurality voting system|double mandate]] districts while 17 are chosen from [[Party-list proportional representation|party lists]].

In the October 2005 local elections, [[United Russia]] was expected to cruise to a solid victory; however, the [[Russian Pensioners' Party|Pensioners Party]] put up a strong showing. The final count was (proportional representation):
*19.42% — '''5 seats''' — Pensioners Party
*17.85% — '''5 seats''' — [[United Russia]]
*9.95% — '''3 seats''' — [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist Party]]
*8.57% — '''2 seats''' — [[Union of Rightist Forces]]/[[Yabloko]] coalition
*7.77% — '''2 seats''' — [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]]
*14.67% — Against all candidates

;Double mandates
*'''10 seats''' — No party affiliation
*'''4 seats''' — United Russia
*'''1 seat''' — Pensioners Party
*'''1 seat''' — Liberal Democratic Party of Russia

===Vote===
In 2020, supporters of [[Alexei Navalny]] won at least 16 seats in Tomsk's 37-seat city council while the pro-Putin [[United Russia]] party secured no more than 11 seats.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-politics-election/russias-ruling-party-loses-majority-in-siberian-council-targeted-by-stricken-navalny-idUSKBN2651LL "Russia's ruling party loses majority in Siberian council targeted by stricken Navalny"], reuters.com.

==Economy==
[[File:Blazon monument in Tomsk.jpg|thumb|Lenin Square in Tomsk]]{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2020}}

===Energy generation===
Tomsk has the oldest electrical grid in [[Siberia]]. There are three power stations in the city:
#TEC-1 (launched on January 1, 1896)
#GRES-2 (launched on May 28, 1945)
#TEC-3 (launched on October 29, 1988)

Tomsk consumes more electric energy than it produces. The bulk of the city's electric and thermal energy is produced by the GRES-2 (281 MWt) and TEC-3 (140 MWt) powerplants, belonging to Tomskenergo Inc. Tomsk supplements its energy needs with electricity generated at [[Seversk]].

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Siberia}}

A large number of educational institutions in the city have contributed to making Tomsk a major center for Russia's IT industry. Tomsk was one of the first cities in Russia to gain access to the Internet, which became available in the early 1990s owing to grants received by universities and scientific cooperation.

==Culture==

Tomsk has many local cultural institutions including several drama theaters, as well as a children's theater and a puppet theater. Major concert venues in the city include the Conservatory Concert hall and the Tomsk Palace of Sport. The city also boasts cultural centers dedicated to [[Germany|German]], [[Poland|Polish]] and [[Tatar]] languages and culture.

One of the city's prominent theaters was destroyed in an act of [[terrorism]] in 1905. The [[Korolevsky Theater]] (built in 1884–85) was being used by a group of [[communist]] revolutionaries when the theater was attacked and set on fire by members of the [[Black Hundred]], a hard-line nationalist organization. Those who escaped the flames were gunned down by Black Hundred members waiting outside the theater. Estimates put the number of casualties between 200 and 1000.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

There are a number of museums in Tomsk devoted to various subjects, most notably art, local history and wood carving. There is also a Museum of Oppression, housed in a former KGB dungeon. Tomsk State University has a number of small museums with exhibits on [[archaeology]], [[paleontology]], [[zoology]], as well as a [[herbarium]] and a [[Porfiry Krylov (botanist)|botanical garden]]

As in many other cities in the former [[Soviet Union]], the revolutionary government destroyed a number of old churches in the city including two that had existed since the 17th century. However, Tomsk managed to save some of its churches by transforming them into machine shops, warehouses, archives, and even residential buildings. Since the end of the communist era some of the churches have been renovated and returned to their congregations.

Tomsk is well known for its intricate "gingerbread" decoration of traditional wooden houses in the area. However, the number of old homes in this style is decreasing due to redevelopment or some of them catching fire, as the structures have little to no fire protection.

[[Trud Stadium (Tomsk)|Trud (Labor) Stadium]], in central Tomsk was the base for matches with the [[FC Tom Tomsk]], the city's professional [[association football|football]] club, before dissolving in 2022. The team's 2004 promotion to the [[Russian Premier League]] gave local fans a chance to see some of the nation's best teams play at the city's own stadium.

Tomsk has many local media outlets including the ''{{ill|TV2 (Tomsk)|ru|ТВ2}}'' television station, shut down by the authorities and turned into an internet TV medium,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.golos-ameriki.ru/content/russia-tomsk-tv/2644267.html|script-title=ru:Томский телеканал ТВ2, закрытый властями, работает в Интернете|date=14 February 2015|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|language=ru|access-date=29 October 2015}}</ref> the radio stations ''[[Radio Siberia]]'' and ''[[Echo of Moscow|Echo of Moscow in Tomsk]]'' along with several newspapers (''[[Tomskaya Nedelya]], [[Krasnoye Znamya]]'' and ''[[Vechernii Tomsk]]'').

In April 2006 Tomsk received international media attention as the venue of a major summit on economic cooperation, held in the city between [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] and [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|German Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]].
