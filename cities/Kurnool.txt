Both the major and minor edits are found at Erragudi (also called the Yerragudi or Jonnagiri site). These are among the oldest discovered inscriptions in India.

[[Belum Caves]] are geologically and historically important caves in the district.  There are indications that Jain and Buddhist monks were occupying these caves centuries ago. Many Buddhists relics were found inside the caves.  These relics are now housed in the Museum at [[Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh|Ananthapur]]. The [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) found remnants of vessels and other artifacts of the pre-Buddhist era and has dated the remnants of vessels found in the caves to 4500&nbsp;BC.<ref name="show">[http://www.showcaves.com/english/in/showcaves/Belum.html] Show Caves of India: Belum Caves</ref>

=== Vijayanagara era ===
Little was known about Kurnool town before the 11th century. The earliest knowledge of this settlement dates from the 11th century. It has developed as a transit place on the southern banks of the river [[Tungabhadra]].

Ruled by the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]] in the 12th century and later taken over by the [[Kakatiya dynasty]] in the 13th century, Kurnool developed into a transit point on the southern banks of the [[Tungabhadra River]]. It eventually fell under the rule of a [[Jagirdar of Banganapalle|jaghirdar]] before becoming a part of the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar dynasty]]. [[Achyuta Deva Raya|King Achyuta Raya]], successor of Sri Krishnadeva Raya constructed the [[Konda Reddy Fort|Kurnool Fort]] during the 16th century.
