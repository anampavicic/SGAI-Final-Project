Weber. p. 4:

"That part of India which today we call by the Persian name <nowiki>''Penjab''</nowiki> is named ''Panchanada'' in the sacred language of the Indians; either of which names may be rendered in Greek by Πενταποταμια. The Persian origin of the former name is not at all in doubt, although the words of which it is composed are both Indian and Persian.... But, in truth, that final word is never, to my knowledge, used by the Indians in proper names compounded in this way; on the other hand, there exist multiple Persian names which end with that word, e.g., ''Doab'' and ''Nilab''. Therefore, it is probable that the name Penjab, which is today found in all geographical books, is of more recent origin and is to be attributed to the Muslim kings of India, among whom the Persian language was mostly in use. That the Indian name Panchanada is ancient and genuine is evident from the fact that it is already seen in the ''Ramayana'' and ''Mahabharata'', the most ancient Indian poems, and that no other exists in addition to it among the Indians; for ''Panchála'', which English translations of the ''Ramayana'' render with Penjab...is the name of another region, entirely distinct from Pentapotamia...."{{whose translation|reason=has several mistakes – looks like Google translation|date=August 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1-last=Latif|author1-first=Syad Muhammad|title=History of the Panjáb from the Remotest Antiquity to the Present Time|year=1891|publisher=Calcultta Central Press Company|page=1|quote=The Panjáb, the Pentapotamia of the Greek historians, the north-western region of the empire of Hindostán, derives its name from two Persian words, ''panj'' (five), an ''áb'' (water), having reference to the five rivers which confer on the country its distinguishing features." |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzBAAQAAMAAJ&pg=PR1}}</ref><ref name="Khalid">{{cite journal|author1-last=Khalid|author1-first=Kanwal|title=Lahore of Pre Historic Era|journal=Journal of the Research Society of Pakistan|volume=52|issue=2|page=73|year=2015|quote=The earliest mention of five rivers in the collective sense was found in Yajurveda and a word Panchananda was used, which is a Sanskrit word to describe a land where five rivers meet.

{{main|History of Punjab}}

=== Ancient period ===
It is believed that the earliest evidence of human habitation in Punjab traces to the [[Soan Valley]] of the [[Pothohar Plateau|Pothohar]], between the [[Indus]] and the [[Jhelum river]]s, where [[Soanian|Soanian culture]] developed between 774,000 BC and 11,700 BC. This period goes back to the first interglacial period in the [[Cryogenian|second Ice Age]], from which remnants of stone and flint tools have been found.{{sfn|Singh|1989|p=1}} The Punjab region was the site of one of the earliest [[cradle of civilization]]s, the [[Bronze Age]] [[Harrapan civilization]] that flourished from about 3000 B.C. and declined rapidly 1,000 years later, following the [[Indo-Aryan migrations]] that overran the region in waves between 1500 and 500 B.C.<ref name=":9">{{Cite book |last=Minahan |first=James |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abNDLZQ6quYC&pg=PA257 |title=Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific: An Encyclopedia |date=2012 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-59884-659-1 |pages=257–259 |language=en |access-date=21 August 2022 |archive-date=18 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221118182901/https://books.google.com/books?id=abNDLZQ6quYC&pg=PA257 |url-status=live }}</ref> The migrating Indo-Aryan tribes gave rise to the [[Iron Age]] [[Vedic civilization]], which lasted till 500 BC.

[[Multan]] was the noted centre of excellence of the region which was attacked by the Greek army led by [[Alexander the Great]]. The Malli tribe together with nearby tribes gathered an army of 90,000 personnel to face the Greek army.

'''British Rule'''

[[File:British Punjab 1909.svg|thumb|Punjab Region on World Map under the [[British Rule]] in 1909]]

Most of the Punjabi homeland formed a province of British India, though a number of small [[princely state]]s retained local rulers who recognized British authority.<ref name=":9" /> The Punjab with its rich farmlands became one of the most important colonial assets.<ref name=":9" /> Lahore was a noted center of learning and culture, and [[Rawalpindi]] became an important military installation.<ref name=":9" />

The [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre|Jallianwala massacre]] fueled the [[Indian independence movement]].<ref name=":9" /> Nationalists declared the independence of India from Lahore in 1930 but were quickly suppressed.<ref name=":9" />

When the Second World War broke out, nationalism in British India had already divided into religious movements.<ref name=":9" /> Many Sikhs and other minorities supported the Hindus, who promised a secular multicultural and multireligious society, and Muslim leaders in Lahore passed a resolution to work for a Muslim Pakistan, making the Punjab region a center of growing conflict between Indian and Pakistani nationalists.<ref name=":9" /> At the end of the war, the British granted separate independence to India and Pakistan, setting off massive communal violence as Muslims fled to Pakistan and Hindu and Sikh Punjabis fled east to India.<ref name=":9" />

The [[British India|British Raj]] had major political, cultural, philosophical, and literary consequences in the Punjab, including the establishment of a new system of education. During the [[Indian independence movement|independence movement]], many Punjabis played a significant role, including [[Madan Lal Dhingra]], [[Sukhdev Thapar]], [[Sardar Ajit Singh|Ajit Singh Sandhu]], [[Bhagat Singh]], [[Udham Singh]], [[Kartar Singh Sarabha]], [[Bhai Parmanand]], [[Choudhry Rahmat Ali]], and [[Lala Lajpat Rai]].

'''After Independence'''

At the time of partition in 1947, the province was split into East and West Punjab. [[East Punjab]] (48%) became part of India, while [[West Punjab]] (52%) became part of Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pakgeotagging.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/partition-of-punjab-in-1947.html |title=Pakistan Geotagging: Partition of Punjab in 1947 |access-date=11 February 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208221714/http://pakgeotagging.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/partition-of-punjab-in-1947.html |archive-date=8 February 2016|date=3 October 2014 }}.

Another major consequence of partition was the sudden shift towards religious homogeneity that occurred in all districts across Punjab owing to the new international border that cut through the province. This rapid demographic shift was primarily due to wide-scale migration but also caused by large-scale [[Religious persecution#Religious cleansing|religious cleansing]] riots which were witnessed across the region at the time. According to historical demographer [[Tim Dyson]], in the eastern regions of Punjab that ultimately became [[Punjab, India|Indian Punjab]] following independence, districts that were 66% Hindu in 1941 became 80% Hindu in 1951; those that were 20% Sikh became 50% Sikh in 1951. Conversely, in the western regions of Punjab that ultimately became Pakistani Punjab, all districts became almost exclusively Muslim by 1951.{{sfn|Dyson|2018|pp=188–189}}

===Topography===
[[File:Murree hill station,Pakistan.jpeg|thumb|Punjab features mountainous terrain near the [[hill station]] of [[Murree]].]]
[[File:Road Block due to landslide at Girdu.JPG|thumb|The route from [[Dera Ghazi Khan]] to [[Fort Munro]]|left]]
Punjab's landscape mostly consists of fertile alluvial plains of the [[Indus River]] and its four major tributaries in Pakistan, the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]], [[Chenab River|Chenab]], [[Ravi River|Ravi]], and [[Sutlej]] rivers which traverse Punjab north to south – the fifth of the "five waters" of Punjab, the [[Beas River]], lies exclusively in the Indian state of Punjab. The landscape is amongst the most heavily irrigated on earth and canals can be found throughout the province. Punjab also includes several mountainous regions, including the [[Sulaiman Mountains]] in the southwest part of the province, the [[Margalla Hills]] in the north near [[Islamabad]], and the [[Salt Range]] which divides the most northerly portion of Punjab, the [[Pothohar Plateau]], from the rest of the province. Sparse [[deserts]] can be found in southern Punjab near the border with Rajasthan and the Sulaiman Range. Punjab also contains part of the [[Thal Desert|Thal]] and [[Cholistan Desert|Cholistan]] deserts. In the South, Punjab's elevation reaches {{convert|2327|m|ft|0}}{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} near the hill station of [[Fort Munro]] in Dera Ghazi Khan.

===Climate===

[[File:Punjab sunset.JPG|thumb|Sunset in Punjab, during summer]]
Most areas in Punjab experience extreme weather with foggy winters, often accompanied by rain. By mid-February the temperature begins to rise; springtime weather continues until mid-April, when the summer heat sets in.
The onset of the southwest [[monsoon]] is anticipated to reach Punjab by May, but since the early 1970s, the weather pattern has been irregular. The spring monsoon has either skipped over the area or has caused it to rain so hard that floods have resulted. June and July are oppressively hot. Although official estimates rarely place the temperature above 46&nbsp;°C, newspaper sources claim that it reaches 51&nbsp;°C and regularly carry reports about people who have succumbed to the heat. Heat records were broken in [[Multan]] in June 1993, when the [[Temperature measurement|mercury]] was reported to have risen to 54&nbsp;°C. In August the oppressive heat is punctuated by the rainy season, referred to as ''barsat'', which brings relief in its wake. The hardest part of the summer is then over, but cooler weather does not come until late October.

In early 2007, the province experienced one of the coldest winters in the last 70 years.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dawn.com/2007/01/06/nat47.htm|title= Mercury drops to freezing point – Dawn Pakistan|date= 6 January 2007}}</ref>

Punjab's region temperature ranges from −2° to 45&nbsp;°C, but can reach 50&nbsp;°C (122&nbsp;°F) in summer and can touch down to −10&nbsp;°C in winter.

Climatically, Punjab has three major seasons:<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web |url=http://punjabgovt.nic.in/punjabataglance/SomeFacts.htm |title=Welcome to Official Web site of Punjab, India |access-date=23 November 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123230402/http://punjabgovt.nic.in/PUNJABATAGLANCE/SomeFacts.htm |archive-date=23 November 2005 }}</ref>

* Hot weather (April to early June) when temperature rises as high as {{convert|123|°F|°C|abbr=on}}.
* Rainy season (late June to September). Average annual rainfall ranges between 950–1200&nbsp;mm sub-mountain region and 500–750&nbsp;mm in the plains.
* Cold / Foggy / mild weather (October to March). Temperature goes down as low as {{convert|35.6|°F|°C|abbr=on}}.
{{clear}}
Weather extremes are notable from the hot and barren south to the cool hills of the north. The foothills of the [[Himalayas]] are found in the extreme north as well, and feature a much cooler and wetter climate, with snowfall common at higher altitudes.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}
