'''Vologda Oblast''' ({{langx|ru|Вологодская область|Vologodskaya oblastʹ}}, {{IPA|ru|vəlɐˈɡotskəjə ˈobləsʲtʲ|IPA}}; {{Langx|vep|Vologdan agj}}) is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (an [[oblast]]). Its [[administrative center]] is [[Vologda]]. The oblast has a population of 1,202,444 ([[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census]]).<ref name="2010Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}</ref> The largest city is [[Cherepovets]], the home of the [[Severstal]] metallurgical plant, the largest industrial enterprise in the oblast.

Vologda Oblast is home to many historic monuments, such as the [[Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery]], [[Ferapontov Monastery]] (a [[World Heritage Site]]) with the [[fresco]]es of [[Dionisius]], the two medieval towns of [[Velikiy Ustyug]] and [[Belozersk]], and the baroque churches of [[Totma]] and [[Ustyuzhna]].

Large reserves of wood and fresh water are the main natural resources.

==History==
{{Sources|date=August 2022}}
[[File:ЛитографияКБМ1897.jpg|right|thumb|View of Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery. A [[Lithography|lithograph]] from 1897]]

The area of Vologda Oblast was settled by [[Finnic peoples]] in prehistory, and most of the [[Toponymy|toponyms]] in the region are in fact Finnic. [[Vepsians]], who still live in the west of the oblast, are the descendants of that population. Subsequently, the area was colonized by the Russians. [[Belozersk]] was mentioned in chronicles in 862 as one of the oldest towns in Russia. Much of the area was controlled by the [[Novgorod Republic]], in particular, [[Totma]] was founded in 1152. [[Veliky Ustyug]] and the west of the current territory of the Oblast, with Belozersk and [[Ustyuzhna]], belonged to the [[Vladimir-Suzdal|Vladimir-Suzdal Principality]] and were constantly threatened by Novgorod. Not later than in the 13th century the Novgorod merchants already reached the [[White Sea]]. They reached the area by using the waterways. The main waterway to the White Sea was the [[Northern Dvina]], and Novgorod merchants used the [[Volga River|Volga]] and its tributary, the [[Sheksna River|Sheksna]], along the Slavyanka River into Lake Nikolskoye, then the boats were taken by land to Lake Blagoveshchenskoye, from there downstream along the Porozovitsa River into [[Lake Kubenskoye]] and further to the [[Sukhona River|Sukhona]] and the Northern Dvina.<ref name="Plechko">{{cite book|last=Плечко|first=Л.А.|script-title=ru:Старинные водные пути|url=http://www.skitalets.ru/books/star_puti/|year=1985|publisher=Физкультура и спорт|location=Moscow|language=ru|access-date=December 21, 2011|archive-date=September 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925151704/http://www.skitalets.ru/books/star_puti/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the 13th century, minor principalities started to proliferate. First, the [[Principality of Beloozero]] separated from [[Rostov, Yaroslavl Oblast|Rostov]], its northern and northeastern parts in the 15th century became quasi-independent, forming smaller feudal states like the [[Principality of Zaozerye]] or the [[Principality of Kubena]]. Many smaller principalities are only mentioned once in chronicles, and the very existence of these principalities is questionable. Between 1452 and 1481, Vologda was the center of the [[Principality of Vologda]], the last independent principality in Vologda lands. By the end of the 15th century, all these lands were a part of the [[Great Duchy of Moscow]].

In the 14th and the 15th centuries, the lands around Vologda became attractive for monks looking for desolate areas but still wishing to keep connections with the princes of Moscow. The princes, in their turn, viewed the monasteries as means to keep the influence of the Grand Duchy of Moscow in its remote areas. A number of influential monasteries, including [[Spaso-Prilutsky Monastery|Spaso-Prilutsky]], [[Pavlo-Obnorsky Monastery|Pavlo-Obnorsky]], [[Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery|Kirillo-Belozersky]], and [[Ferapontov Monastery|Ferapontov]] monasteries, were founded. Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery soon became one of the most prominent Russian monasteries, with a lot of political influence, and successful economic development.

In the middle of the 15th century, the Vologda Lands were strongly involved with the [[Muscovite Civil War]]: Thus, [[Vasily the Blind]] was exiled to Vologda in 1446 and was released from his allegiance oath by the [[hegumen]] of the [[Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery]], and by the late 1440s the Sukhona valley became the battlefield between the retreating army of [[Dmitry Shemyaka]] and the army of Vasily, chasing Shemyaka. During the [[Time of Troubles]], the area was ravaged by Polish troops, who at some point besieged Vologda but did not succeed in conquering the city.

In the 17th century, Vologda was a prosperous city located on the main trading route from Moscow to Western Europe. During the reign of Tsar [[Peter the Great]] in the 18th century, Vologda became a shipbuilding center and played an important role in support of Russian military operations against Sweden. However, the importance of Vologda as a trade center was diminished after [[Saint Petersburg]] was founded in 1703, and the foreign trade was rerouted to the [[Baltic Sea]]. Peter even imposed restrictions on the White Sea trade.

Vologda was the northernmost territory where [[Serfdom in Russia|serfdom]] existed in Russia. In the lands west and south of Vologda, estates existed, but to the north and east of Vologda serfdom was never implemented, and the population owned their land.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.za-nauku.ru//index2.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1380&pop=1&page=0|script-title=ru:Особенности исторического пути России в концепции Л.В.Милова|last=Хитров|first=Дмитрий Алексеевич|publisher=Движение за возрождение отечественной науки|language=ru|access-date=25 February 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Vitushechnikovs house in 1910s.jpg|thumb|Vologda in the 1910s]]

In 1708, [[Peter the Great]] issued an [[ukase|edict]] which established seven governorates.<ref name="1708List">[http://constitution.garant.ru/history/act1600-1918/2005/ Указ об учреждении губерний и о росписании к ним городов] {{in lang|ru}}</ref><ref name="ATSBook">{{Cite book|last=Архивный отдел Администрации Мурманской области.

Two of the governorates, [[Archangelgorod Governorate]] (east of the oblast) and [[Ingermanland Governorate]] (west of the oblast), were located in the present-day area of Vologda oblast. Vologda became a part of Archangelgorod Governorate. Subsequently, the western part of the Oblast was transferred to [[Novgorod Governorate]]. In 1780, Vologda became the administrative center of [[Vologda Viceroyalty]] which included the territory of the former Archangelgorod Governorate. Eventually, the viceroyalty was transformed into [[Vologda Governorate]]. After a sequence of further administrative reforms, Vologda Oblast was established in 1937.

During the [[Second World War]], the Soviet Union operated a prisoner-of-war camp in [[Kornilyevo]], first for Poles and Finns captured during the Soviet invasions of [[Invasion of Poland|Poland]] and [[Winter War|Finland]], and later for German POWs.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Janczak|first=Bartosz|year=2016|title=Obozy jenieckie w Griazowcu w latach 1939–1948|journal=Łambinowicki rocznik muzealny|location=Opole|language=pl|volume=39|pages=27–30|issn=0137-5199}}</ref> Parts of [[Oshtinsky District]] in the west of the oblast became the only areas of Vologda Oblast to be occupied by foreign (Finnish) troops. The Finnish advance was stopped in October 1941, but the occupation continued till June 1944, when the [[Soviet Army]] started to advance.

In 1955, the construction of [[Severstal]] in the city of [[Cherepovets]], the biggest industrial enterprise in the oblast, was completed.

On 4 July 1997, Vologda, alongside [[Bryansk Oblast|Bryansk]], [[Chelyabinsk Oblast|Chelyabinsk]], [[Magadan Oblast|Magadan]], and [[Saratov Oblast|Saratov]] signed a power-sharing agreement with the government of Russia, granting it autonomy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/moscow-signs-power-sharing-agreements-with-five-more-regions/|title=Moscow Signs Power-Sharing Agreements With Five More Regions|date=1997-07-07|website=Jamestown|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref> The agreement would be abolished on 15 March 2002.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chuman|first=Mizuki|title=The Rise and Fall of Power-Sharing Treaties Between Center and Regions in Post-Soviet Russia|url=http://demokratizatsiya.pub/archives/19_2_L7H017206G216817.pdf|journal=Demokratizatsiya|pages=146}}</ref>

==Politics==
[[File:Legislative Assembly of the Vologda region 4.jpg|right|thumb|The building of the Legislative Assembly in Vologda]]

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Vologda CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The politics in the oblast is governed by the Charter of Vologda Oblast. The laws within the authority of the oblast are passed by the Legislative Assembly of Vologda Oblast. The highest executive body is the Vologda Oblast Administration. It also includes the executive bodies of the subdivisions such as districts, and is responsible for the daily administration. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the governor who is the head of the oblast and acts as guarantor of the observance of the Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].

As a subject of the Russian Federation, the Vologda Oblast has a certain constituent power, which consists of the right to adopt its charter, laws, and other regulatory legal acts. The charter of the Vologda Oblast establishes the foundations of the legal status, ensuring human and civil rights, as well as the institutions of democracy, the economic and financial foundations of the region, the foundations of socio-cultural policy, the organization of state power, administrative-territorial division and the organization of local self-government.

{{main|Governor of Vologda Oblast}}
[[File:Vologda, Vologda Oblast, Russia - panoramio - Сергей Зубов.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The building of the government of the Vologda Oblast and the administration of the governor]]

Executive power is exercised by the [[governor of Vologda Oblast|governor]], the government of the Vologda Oblast headed by him, and other executive authorities. The governor is elected by the region's inhabitants for a term of five years and cannot hold the said position for more than two consecutive terms. The current governor is [[Oleg Kuvshinnikov]] of United Russia. In December 2011, he was appointed acting governor and then empowered by deputies of the Legislative Assembly. In 2012, in most subjects of the Russian Federation, direct elections of governors were returned with a municipal filter, a two-term limit, and the possibility of dismissal by decree of the President of the Russian Federation. In the early [[:ru:Выборы губернатора Вологодской области (2014)|elections in September 2014]], Kuvshinnikov won 62.98% of the vote and was elected for five years. In the [[:ru:Выборы губернатора Вологодской области (2019)|elections in September 2019]], Kuvshinnikov was re-elected for five years.

==Geography==
[[File:Геологическое обнажение пород верхней перми на реке Сухона.jpg|right|thumb|River Sukhona]]

Vologda Oblast borders with [[Arkhangelsk Oblast]] in the north, [[Kirov Oblast]] in the east, [[Kostroma Oblast]] in the southeast, [[Yaroslavl Oblast]] in the south, [[Tver Oblast|Tver]] and [[Novgorod Oblast]]s in the southwest, [[Leningrad Oblast]] in the west, and the [[Republic of Karelia]] in the northwest.

Vologda Oblast is located on the [[East European Plain]], and most of it represents forested hilly landscape. The southwest of the oblast, along the Sheksna and the Mologa, is flat. The northwestern part is mostly of glacial origin, with the [[Andoma Hills]], the [[Veps Hills]], and a number of minor hill chains.<ref name="GSE">{{cite book|title=Вологодская область|url=http://bse.sci-lib.com/article006331.html|publisher=Great Soviet Encyclopedia}}</ref> The highest point of the oblast is {{convert|304|m|ft}} high [[Malgora]] hill.<ref name="PB">[https://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=74502 Peakbagger - Gora Malgora]</ref> In the east of the oblast, the valleys of the [[Vaga River|Vaga]], the [[Sukhona River|Sukhona]], and the [[Yug River|Yug]] are cut through the hills. The southeast of the oblast is occupied by the [[Northern Ridge]], which is located south of the valley of the Sukhona.

Much of the area of the oblast is occupied by coniferous forest (''[[taiga]]'') and by swamps.

[[File:Bliss in Russia.jpg|thumb|Hills in Vologda Oblast. Northwest of the city of Vologda, close to the selo of Molochnoye.]]

The area of Vologda Oblast is split between the basins of the [[White Sea]], the [[Baltic Sea]], and the [[Caspian Sea]]. In the northeast of the oblast, in Vologodsky district, there is a point which is a triple [[Drainage divide|divide]] of the river basins of the [[Neva River|Neva]] (Baltic Sea), the [[Volga River|Volga]] (Caspian Sea), and the [[Onega River|Onega]] (White Sea), and thus the basins of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Arctic Ocean]], and the [[endorheic basin]]s of the interior of [[Eurasia]]. This is one of the very few such triple divides in the world and the only one in Russia. The southwestern shore of [[Lake Onega]], one of the biggest freshwater lakes in Europe, belongs to Vologda Oblast, and the tributaries of Lake Onega, the biggest of which are the [[Vytegra River]] and the [[Andoma River]], belong to the river basin of the Neva and thus drain to the Baltic Sea. Also, minor areas in the west of the oblast drain into the [[Oyat River]] which is a right tributary of the [[Svir River|Svir]] and belongs to the basin of the Neva. The western part of the oblast drains into the [[Rybinsk Reservoir]] of the Volga. The biggest tributaries of the reservoir are the [[Mologa River|Mologa]], the [[Suda River|Suda]], the [[Sogozha River|Sogozha]], and the [[Sheksna River|Sheksna]]. [[Lake Beloye, Vologda Oblast|Lake Beloye]], one of the biggest lakes in the oblast, is the source of the Sheksna. Some areas in the south of the oblast drain into tributaries of the Volga, including the [[Unzha River|Unzha]]. [[Lake Vozhe]] in the northwest of the Oblast, with its main tributary, the [[Vozhega River|Vozhega]], drains in the [[Onega River]] in the White Sea basin. The rest of the oblast, including [[Lake Kubenskoye]], another major lake in the oblast, belongs to the river basin of the [[Northern Dvina]]. The Northern Dvina is formed in the northeast of the oblast from merging of the [[Sukhona River|Sukhona]] and the [[Yug River|Yug]]. The Sukhona forms the major waterway of Vologda Oblast. Another major tributary of the Northern Dvina, which has its source in Vologda Oblast, is the [[Vaga River|Vaga]].

Two areas in Vologda Oblast have been designated as protected natural areas of federal significance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oopt.info/index.php?page=53|script-title=ru:ООПТ Северо-Западного округа|publisher=Особо охраняемые природные территории России|language=ru|access-date=1 January 2011}}</ref> These are [[Russky Sever National Park]] in the center of the oblast and [[Darwin Nature Reserve]] in the southwest of the oblast (shared with Yaroslavl Oblast).

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Vologda Oblast}}

The oblast is administratively divided into four [[city of federal subject significance|cities and towns under the oblast's jurisdiction]] ([[Vologda]], [[Cherepovets]], [[Sokol, Vologda Oblast|Sokol]], and [[Veliky Ustyug]]) and twenty-six districts. Another ten towns ([[Babayevo (town), Vologda Oblast|Babayevo]], [[Belozersk]], [[Gryazovets]], [[Kadnikov]], [[Kharovsk]], [[Kirillov (town)|Kirillov]], [[Nikolsk, Vologda Oblast|Nikolsk]], [[Totma]], [[Ustyuzhna]], and [[Vytegra]]) have the status of the towns of district significance. The town of [[Krasavino]] is under administrative jurisdiction of Veliky Ustyug Town of Oblast Significance.<ref name="OKATO">{{OKATO reference|19}}</ref>

==Economy==
===Industry===
The biggest industrial enterprise of Vologda Oblast is the [[Severstal]] steel plant located in the city of [[Cherepovets]]. The metallurgical industry is responsible for approximately 50% of the total industrial production of the oblast.<ref name="industry">{{cite web |url= http://vologda-oblast.ru/main.asp?V=31 |script-title=ru:Промышленность - Экономика |publisher=Официальный сайт Правительства Вологодской области |language=ru |work=vologda-oblast.ru |year=2012 |access-date=4 January 2012}}</ref> it is followed by chemical (also based in Cherepovets), food, and timber industries, and the machine building industry.

Metallurgy was a traditional industry developed in the region since the 16th century, when its center was located in Ustyuzhna. Another traditional industries were salt production (around Totma) and glass making (in what is currently Chagodoshchensky District). In the 18th century, timber production started to grow rapidly. In the 19th century, the textile industry enterprises making [[flax]] textiles started to proliferate.<ref name="industry"/> In 1871, the Danish merchant Friedrich Buman opened a specialized butter factory in the manor of Fominskoye (13&nbsp;km northwest of Vologda). It was the first butter factory both in [[Vologda Governorate]] and in Russia. Since then Vologda became the center of the butter industry, and the [[Vologda butter]], a special type of butter with the taste of nuts invented by Nikolay Vereschagin and Buman, became a world trademark.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wines|first=Michael|date=May 27, 2000|title=Vologda Journal; Russia's Favorite Spread Smeared by Counterfeiters|journal=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/27/world/vologda-journal-russia-s-favorite-spread-smeared-by-counterfeiters.html?src=pm}}</ref>

===Agriculture===

The agriculture in the oblast is essentially cattle breeding with milk and meat production, production of eggs, growing of crops, flax, potatoes, and vegetables. In 2008, 73% of all agricultural products were produced by large-scale farms.<ref name="agric">{{cite web |url= http://vologda-oblast.ru/main.asp?V=31 |script-title=ru:Агропромышленный комплекс |publisher=Официальный сайт Правительства Вологодской области |language=ru |work=vologda-oblast.ru |year=2012 |access-date=4 January 2012}}</ref>

===Transportation===
The area of current Vologda Oblast has always been located on the trading routes connecting central Russia to the White Sea, and, in fact, in the 17th century the White Sea was the main sea export route for Russia. The whole course of the Sukhona is navigable, as well as the lower courses of some of its tributaries, including the Vologda. However, there is currently very little or no regular passenger navigation on the Sukhona. [[Volga–Baltic Waterway]], first constructed in the 19th century as the Mariinsk Canal System and then reconstructed in the 20th century, connects the river basins of the Volga and the Neva via the Sheksna, Lake Beloye, the [[Kovzha River|Kovzha]], and the Vytegra, and is one of the main waterways in European Russia. The [[Northern Dvina Canal]] connects the Sheksna and Lake Kubenskoye, thus being a connection between the river basins of the Volga and the Northern Dvina.

One of the principal highways in Russia, [[M8 highway (Russia)|M8]], connects Moscow and Arkhangelsk, and passes [[Vologda]]. This highway is paved and heavily used. Other important paved roads include [[A114 highway (Russia)|A114 highway]], connecting [[Vologda]] to [[Cherepovets]] and [[Saint Petersburg]], the roads connecting Vologda to Kirillov (the part which continues to Lipin Bor, Vytegra, and [[Pudozh]], is partially paved), Vologda to Veliky Ustyug via Totma, Totma to Nikolsk via Imeni Babushkina, and [[Kotlas]] to [[Manturovo]] and eventually to [[Kostroma]] and Moscow via Veliky Ustyug and Nikolsk. There are connections from Ustyuzhna to [[Pestovo, Pestovsky District, Novgorod Oblast|Pestovo]] and [[Vesyegonsk]]. However, the road network is underdeveloped, especially close to the borders of the oblast. There is only one road crossing from Vologda Oblast to Kostroma Oblast. Several roads cross into Kirov Oblast, but they are all unpaved and badly maintained. So is the connection between Lipin Bor and [[Kargopol]]. In the west of the oblast, there are very few through roads even across the district boundaries. Nevertheless, the vast majority of settlements have road connections of some quality, the roads are used for timber transportation, and there is regular bus service on the main roads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://all-transport.info/regions/ru35.html|script-title=ru:Вологодская область|publisher=All-transport|language=ru|access-date=21 December 2013}}</ref>

[[File:ТУ8-0064 с грузовым поездом.jpg|right|thumb|[[Belorucheyskaya narrow gauge railway|Belorucheyskaya forest railway]] in 2015]]

The principal railway line in the oblast is the railroad connecting Moscow and Arkhangelsk. The piece between [[Vologda]] and Arkhangelsk was constructed in the 1890s. A branch from [[Konosha]] eastwards to [[Kotlas]] and further to [[Vorkuta]], which crosses the north of the oblast, was constructed in the 1940s to facilitate the transport of coal from the [[Komi Republic]]. The railway connecting Vologda with Saint Petersburg via Cherepovets was built in the 1900s. There is also a railway connecting Vologda via [[Vokhtoga]] to [[Buy, Kostroma Oblast|Buy]]. At Vokhtoga, the Monza Railroad branches off east. It was built for timber transport and is operated by the timber production authorities. The Monza railroad runs along the border of Vologda and Kostroma Oblasts. The plans to extend it further east to Nikolsk were never realized.<ref>{{cite book|last=Белихов|first=А. Б. |editor=А.М.

Некрасова.|location=Кострома}}</ref> The Monza Railroad has a separate station in Vokhoga, Vokhtoga-2 railway station. The headquarters of the Monzales company which owns the railroad are located in Vokhtoga. A big number of [[narrow gauge railway]]s have been built in the 1950s and 1960s to facilitate the transport of timber, but since then most of these became unprofitable and have been destroyed.

Currently, the local aviation has almost disappeared. There is an [[Vologda Airport|airport]] in Vologda. Locally, there is infrequent service to [[Veliky Ustyug Airport|Veliky Ustyug]], [[Kichmengsky Gorodok Airport|Kichmengsky Gorodok]], and [[Vytegra Airport|Vytegra]].

The oil transport system, [[Baltic Pipeline System]], runs through the oblast, with three oil-pumping stations located at [[Nyuksenitsa]], [[Pogorelovo]], and [[Gryazovets]].

==Arts and culture==

===Literature===
[[File:Batjuskov giallo.png|thumb|upright|[[Konstantin Batyushkov|Batyushkov's]] portrait by [[Orest Kiprensky]] (1815)]]

In the 19th and the 20th centuries, many notable authors had their estates in Vologda Region; however, their literary activity mostly was related to Saint Petersburg rather than to the estates. Thus, [[Konstantin Batyushkov]], a poet, was born and raised in his estate in [[Danilovskoye, Vologda Oblast|Danilovskoye]], but became a notable author after he moved to the state service to Saint Petersburg, and he only returned to Vologda (where he eventually died) after he developed a mental illness. [[Igor Severyanin]], a 20th-century poet, spent considerable periods of his life in the estate of his uncle, [[Vladimirovka, Vologda Oblast|Vladimirovka]], close to the city of [[Cherepovets]].

In the 20th century, two of the authors of the [[Village prose]] movement in Soviet literature, which predominantly described rural life, were tightly connected with Vologda Region. [[Vasily Belov]] was born in the village of Timonikha, currently in Kharovsky District, and lives in Vologda. [[Alexander Yashin]] was born in Nikolsky District and completed his studies in Nikolsk, but then moved to Moscow. A poet [[Nikolay Rubtsov]] spent much of his life in Vologda Oblast before being killed in a domestic dispute in 1971. [[Yury Iosifovich Koval|Yury Koval]], mainly known for his children's books, spent considerable periods of his life in Vologda Oblast.

Three of the towns in the oblast—Belozersk, Totma, and Veliky Ustyug—are classified as historical towns by the Ministry of Culture of Russian Federation, which implies certain restrictions on construction in their historical centers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rg.ru/2010/09/29/istor-posel-dok.html|title=Приказ Министерства культуры Российской Федерации, Министерства регионального развития Российской Федерации от 29 июля 2010 г.

The old center of Vologda until the 1990s contained many wooden houses, including five wooden [[classicism|classicist]] manors, protected by the government as cultural heritage monuments.{{RKN_base}} Despite the protection, many of these burnt down, or were simply demolished. Still, many buildings, including four classicist manors, survive, and make Vologda one of the biggest collection of wooden town houses of the 19th century in Russia.

Some of the best examples of rural wooden architecture are collected in open-air Ethnographic Museum in [[Semyonkovo]], northwest of Vologda.

Several cities and towns in Vologda Oblast preserved their architectural heritage. In contrast to many other Russian towns in the 1920s and 1930s, Veliky Ustyug was left intact and declared the national cultural heritage very early after 1917. It preserved therefore almost all of its historic center. Vologda, Belozersk, Totma, Gryazovets, and Ustyuzhna keep many of their historical buildings. In particular, several churches in Totma were built in the 18th century in the unique style which is sometimes referred to as [[Totma Baroque]].

The relative desolation of Vologda lands attracted monks looking for solitude, resulting in numerous monasteries. The [[Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery]], the [[Spaso-Prilutsky Monastery]], the [[Goritsky Monastery (Goritsy)|Goritsky Monastery]], and the [[Troitse-Gledensky Monastery]] represent examples of Russian medieval fortification architecture and also contain buildings rated among the best preserved cultural heritage. The [[Ferapontov Monastery]], included into the [[World Heritage]] list, contains the only survived fully painted church in Russia with the frescoes of [[Dionisius]]. As of 2010, four of the monasteries in Vologda Oblast were acting: the Kirillo-Belozersky, the Spaso-Prilutsky, the Goritsky, and the [[Pavlo-Obnorsky Monastery|Pavlo-Obnorsky]] monasteries.
