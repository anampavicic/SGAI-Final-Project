'''Cumaná''' ({{IPA|es|kumaˈna}}) is the capital city of [[Venezuela]]'s [[Sucre (state)|Sucre State]]. It is located {{convert|402|km}} east of [[Caracas]]. Cumaná was one of the first cities founded by [[Spain]] in the mainland [[Americas]] and is the [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities#South America|oldest continuously-inhabited]] Hispanic-established city in [[South America]]. Its early history includes several successful counters by the indigenous people of the area who were attempting to prevent Spanish incursion into their land, resulting in the city being refounded several times. The municipality of Sucre, which includes the capital city, Cumaná, had a population of 358,919 at the 2011 Census; the latest estimate (as at mid 2016) is 423,546.<ref>Instituto Nacional de Estadistica, Caracas.</ref>

The city is located at the mouth of the [[Manzanares River (South America)|Manzanares River]] on the [[Caribbean]] coast, in the northeast of Venezuela. It is home to first and most important of the five campuses of the [[Universidad de Oriente]], and is a busy maritime port, home of one of the largest [[tuna]] fleets in Venezuela. The city is close to [[Mochima National Park]], whose beaches are a popular tourist destination among Venezuelans.

Key heroes of and contributors to the Venezuelan independence movement were born in Cumaná, including [[Antonio José de Sucre]], the ‘Gran Mariscal de Ayacucho,’ a leading general who also served as President of Bolivia and President of Peru. Cumaná is also the birthplace to eminent poets, writers and politicians like [[Andrés Eloy Blanco]], an important figure in Latin American literature and who later rose to the national political scene; as well as [[José Antonio Ramos Sucre]], another distinguished poet and diplomat. Several important scientists including [[Pehr Löfling]] from Sweden, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] from Germany, and [[Aimé Bonpland]] from France accomplished experimental works and discoveries while visiting or living in Cumaná in the 18th century. The city is also home to a [[Toyota]] plant, which manufactures the [[Hilux]] and [[Toyota Fortuner]].

==History==
Cumaná was the first settlement founded by [[spaniards|Spain]] in [[Venezuela]], established in 1515 by [[Franciscan Order|Franciscan]] [[friar]]s,<ref name="Floyd">{{cite book|last1=Floyd|first1=Troy|title=The Columbus Dynasty in the Caribbean, 1492-1526|date=1973|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|pages=204–210}}</ref> under the name Nueva Toledo, but due to successful attacks by the indigenous people (such as the [[Cumanagoto people]]), it had to be refounded several times until [[Diego Hernández de Serpa]]'s refoundation in 1569 with the name of Cumaná. [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], attempting a peaceful colonization scheme, was pre-empted by [[Gonzalo de Ocampo]]'s 1521 punitive raids against the local indigenous people, in retaliation for the destruction of the Dominican convent at Chiribichi. In 1537 [[New Andalusia Province]] was established, with Cumaná as capital (for which the Province was also known as the ''Province of Cumaná'').

After [[Amerindian]] attacks became less of a threat, the city was on several occasions destroyed by [[earthquakes]]. Thus, the oldest part of the city is late 17th and 18th century; almost none of the 16th century architecture survived. Gained independence on 7/5/1811.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

==Climate==

The city has a hot [[semi arid]] (Koppen: BSh) climate, narrowly bordering a [[tropical savanna climate]] (Koppen: Aw).
