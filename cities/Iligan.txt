'''Iligan''', officially the '''City of Iligan''' ({{lang-ceb|Dakbayan sa Iligan}}; [[Maranao language|Maranao]]: ''Bandar a Iligan''; {{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Iligan}}), is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] in the [[Regions of the Philippines|region]] of [[Northern Mindanao]], Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 363,115 people making it the second most populous city in Northern Mindanao after [[Cagayan de Oro]].{{PH census|current}}

It is the largest city in the province of [[Lanao del Norte]] both in population and land area wherein it is geographically situated and grouped under the province by the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]], but administered independently from the province. It was once part of [[Central Mindanao]] (Region 12) until the province was moved under Northern Mindanao (Region 10) in 2001.<ref>Godinez-Ortega, C. (September 9, 2001). Iligan City 'moves' to Northern Mindanao, Philippine Daily Inquirer. P. A13.</ref> Iligan is approximately 90 kilometers away from the capital of the province, [[Tubod, Lanao del Norte|Tubod]], and approximately 800 kilometers from the capital of the [[Philippines]], [[Manila]].

Iligan has a total land area of {{convert|813.37|km2}}, making it one of the 10 largest cities in the Philippines in terms of land area. Among the 33 [[Cities of the Philippines|highly urbanized cities of the Philippines]], Iligan is the third-least dense, with a population density of 421 inhabitants per square kilometer, just behind [[Butuan]] and [[Puerto Princesa]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psa.gov.ph/population-and-housing/node/62690|title = Philippine Statistics Authority &#124; Republic of the Philippines}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name Iligan is from the Higaunon (Lumad/Native of Iligan) word "Ilig" which means "to go downstream".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Iligan: The City of Failing Waters |url=https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/sunstar-davao/20160124/281913067126647 |last=Ladaga |first=John Oliver |date=January 24, 2016 |publisher=[[SunStar Davao]] |website=[[PressReader]] |access-date=August 7, 2022}}</ref> However, some also claim that the name of Iligan was taken and inspired by the Higaunon term "iligan" or "ilijan", which means "fortress of defense", an appropriate term due to frequent attacks incurred by pirates as well as other Mindanao tribes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ILIGAN CITY |url=https://region10.dilg.gov.ph/iligan-city/ |publisher=DILG REGION 10 |website=Department of the Interior and Local Government |date=August 2, 2021 |access-date=August 7, 2022}}</ref>

==History==
=== Higaonon Manobo settlement of Bayug ===
Iligan was first settled by Higaonon Manobos on Bayug island, now in Barangay Hinaplanon, four kilometres north of the present city centre. It was a settlement of sea dwellers.

In Dapitan, ''Datu'' Pagbuaya of [[Panglao, Bohol|Panglao]] received the Spaniard [[Miguel Lopez de Legazpi]]'s agents in 1565. Later, Pagbuaya's son Manooc was baptized as ''Don Pedro Manuel'' Manooc. Sometime afterward by the end of the 16th century, Manooc subdued the Higaonon Manobo settlement of Bayug and turned it into one of the earliest Christian settlements in the Philippines.<ref>[http://www.iligan.gov.ph/about-iligan/history/during-spanish-times/ History of Iligan during Spanish times] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140842/http://www.iligan.gov.ph/about-iligan/history/during-spanish-times/ |date=June 12, 2018 }}, iligan.gov.ph. Accessed July 28, 2022.</ref>

=== Spanish rule ===

Although Bayug survived other raids from other enemies, especially Muslims from Lanao, the early settlers and Christian converts moved their settlement from Bayug to Iligan, which the Augustinian [[Recollects]] founded in 1609.<ref>[http://allaboutiligan.blogspot.com/ All About Iligan], allaboutiligan.blogspot.com. Accessed July 28, 2022.</ref> During Christianization, the Spaniards in Iligan received a hundred Spanish soldiers.<ref>San Agustín, Conquistas, lib. 2 cap 37: 545</ref>

The Jesuits replaced the Recollects in 1639. Iligan was the Spaniards' base of operations in attempting to conquer and Christianize the [[Lake Lanao]] area throughout its history. A stone fort called Fort St. Francis Xavier was built in 1642 where Iliganons sought refuge during raids by bandits. But the fort sank due to floods. Another fort was built and this was named Fort Victoria or Cota de Iligan.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

In 1850, because of floods, Don Remigio Cabili, then Iligan's gobernadorcillo, built another fort and moved the [[poblacion]] of the old Iligan located at the mouth of Tubod River west of the old market to its present site.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

Being the oldest town in Northern Mindanao, Iligan was already a part of the once undivided [[Misamis (province)|Misamis Province]] by the year 1832. However, it did not have an independent religious administration because its diocese by then was based at [[Ozamiz|Misamis]], the provincial capital. It was one of the biggest municipalities of Misamis Province.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

The Spaniards abandoned Iligan in 1899, paving the way for the landing of the American forces in 1900.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

===American rule===

[[File:Street-in-iligan-moro-province.jpg|thumbnail|left|Iligan, c. 1903-1913]]

In 1903, the Moro Province was created. Iligan, because of its Moro residents, was taken away from the Misamis Province. Then, Iligan became the capital of the Lanao District and the seat of the government where the American officials lived and held office. Later in 1907, the capital of the Lanao District has transferred to Dansalan.<ref>Prof. Patrocenia T. Acut, [http://www.iligan.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=594&Itemid=609 Iligan During the American Period], Iligan City Official Website</ref>

In 1914, under the restructuring of Moroland after the end of the Moro Province (1903–1913), Iligan became a municipality composed of eight barrios together with the municipal district of Mandulog. After enjoying peace and prosperity for about 40 years, Iligan was invaded by Japanese forces in 1942.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

The liberation of Iligan by the Philippine Commonwealth forces attacked by the Japanese held sway in the city until 1944 to 1945 when the war ended. On November 15, 1944, the city held a Commonwealth Day parade to celebrate the end of Japanese atrocities and occupation.<ref>Prof. Leonor Buhion Enderes, [http://www.iligan.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=387&Itemid=353 Japanese Occupation in Iligan City], Iligan City Official Website</ref>

=== After WW2 ===
==== Establishment of the Iligan Steel Mill ====
{{main|Iligan Steel Mill}}
{{expand section|a discussion of the impact of the steel industry on the local industry of Iligan|date=December 2023}}
The Iligan Steel Mill was established in 1952 as a government-initiated project of the National Shipyards and Steel Corporation (NASSCO).<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/business/steelasia-offers-purhase-national-steel-corporation|title=SteelAsia offers to revive defunct National Steel|last=Tomacruz|first=Sofia|work=Rappler|language=en|access-date=January 27, 2019}}</ref> After NASSCO applied for a $62.3 million loan from the United States–based [[Export–Import Bank of the United States|Eximbank]] to fund projects, the latter suggested a transfer of the facilities' management to the private entity. The company was sold in 1963 to Iligan Integrated Steel Mills, Inc. of the Jacinto family.<ref name=":1" />

====Cityhood====
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
Using the same territorial definition as a municipality, Iligan became a chartered city of Lanao del Norte on June 16, 1950.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra525-iligan-city-charter.html|title=R.A.

In 1983, Iligan was again reclassified as a highly urbanized city.

==== Rising conflicts during the late 1960s====
{{main|First term of the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos}}
The election of [[Ferdinand Marcos]] as [[Presidency of Ferdinand Marcos|President of the Philippines]] saw a large influx of Christian groups settling in Mindanao, displacing many locals and resulting in numerous land ownership conflicts.<ref>See {{Cite book |last=Francia |first=Luis H. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NwQoDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT202 |title=History of the Philippines: From Indios Bravos to Filipinos |date=2013 |publisher=Overlook Press |isbn=978-1-4683-1545-5 |location=New York}}</ref><ref>For an in-depth survey of indigenous peoples and forced land seizures in the Philippines, see {{Cite web |last=Eder |first=James F. |date=June 1994 |title=Indigenous Peoples, Ancestral Lands and Human Rights in the Philippines |url=https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/indigenous-peoples-ancestral-lands-and-human-rights |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181222221421/https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/indigenous-peoples-ancestral-lands-and-human-rights |archive-date=December 22, 2018 |website=Cultural Survival Quarterly}}</ref> The Marcos administration encouraged these new settlers to form militias, which were eventually nicknamed the [[Ilaga]]. The Ilaga were often associated with committed human rights abuses targeted at the [[Moro people|Moro]] and [[Lumad]] people.

=== Iligan during martial law and Marcos administration ===
{{main|Marcos dictatorship|Moro conflict|Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship}}

=== Contemporary history ===

====Asian Financial Crisis and recovery ====
{{expand section|further details of the economic recovery after the reopening of the National Steel Corporation|date=December 2023}}
During the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] Iligan City experienced a severe economic slowdown. A number of industrial plants were closed, most notably the National Steel Corporation. <ref>Maricar T. Manuzon, [http://www.philippinebusiness.com.ph/archives/magazine/vol11-2004/11-1/agenda.htm A Giant Awakens] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228064628/http://www.philippinebusiness.com.ph/archives/magazine/vol11-2004/11-1/agenda.htm|date=February 28, 2008}}, Philippine Business Magazine</ref>

The city began to see some economic recovery with the reopening of the National Steel Corporation, which was renamed Global Steelworks Infrastructures, Inc. (GSII) in 2004. <ref>Genalyn D. Kabiling, [http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2004/02/04/MAIN200402041232.html National Steel Plant reopens], Manila Bulletin</ref> This reopening marked a critical turning point for Iligan, as it restored a significant number of jobs and revitalized the local economy. The re-establishment of steel production brought renewed hope and stability to the community, encouraging further investments and business activities in the region.

In October 2005, GSII officially took a new corporate name: Global Steel Philippines (SPV-AMC), Inc.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090628155601/http://www.prweb.com/releases/2005/08/prweb273857.htm GSII Changes Name to Global Steel Philippines], PRWEB August 19, 2005</ref> This rebranding was part of a broader strategy to rejuvenate the company’s operations and re-establish its presence in the steel industry both locally and internationally. The transition signified not only a change in name but also a commitment to modernizing the plant's facilities and improving production processes to compete effectively in the global market.

=== Lone District ===
Republic Act No. 9724, an Act separating the City of Iligan from the [[Legislative districts of Lanao del Norte#1st District|First Legislative District of the Province of Lanao del Norte]] [http://www.senate.gov.ph/republic_acts/ra%209724.pdf was approved],  by President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] on October 20, 2009. This legislative change elevated Iligan to the status of a lone congressional district, providing it with greater political autonomy and representation. The creation of a separate legislative district allowed Iligan to have its own representative in the Philippine Congress, ensuring that the city's specific needs and interests were more effectively addressed at the national level.

This move was seen as a step towards fostering greater local governance and development. It enabled the city to receive more focused attention and resources from the national government, which in turn could help drive further economic recovery and growth. By having its own legislative district, Iligan could better advocate for policies and programs tailored to its unique economic and social landscape, promoting sustainable development and improved quality of life for its residents.

==Geography==
Iligan is bounded on the north by three municipalities of [[Misamis Oriental]] (namely [[Lugait]], [[Manticao]] and [[Opol]]), to the south by three municipalities of Lanao del Norte ([[Baloi, Lanao del Norte|Baloi]], [[Linamon, Lanao del Norte|Linamon]] and [[Tagoloan, Lanao del Norte|Tagoloan]]) and two municipalities of [[Lanao del Sur]] ([[Kapai]] and [[Tagoloan II]]), to the north-east by the city of [[Cagayan de Oro]], to the east by the municipality of [[Talakag]], [[Bukidnon]]; and to the west by [[Iligan Bay]].

To the west, [[Iligan Bay]] provides ferry and container ship transportation. East of the city, flat cultivated coastal land gives way to steep volcanic hills and mountains providing the waterfalls and cold springs for which the area is well known.

Iligan's seat of government, the city hall, is located at Buhanginan Hills in Barangay Pala-o. The local government structure is composed of one mayor, one vice mayor, and twelve councilors. Each official is elected publicly to a 3-year term and can be re-elected up to 3 terms in succession. The day-to-day administration of the city is handled by the city administrator.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}
