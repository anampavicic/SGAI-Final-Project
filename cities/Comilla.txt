==History==

===Ancient era===
[[File:Shalbanbihar.png|left|thumb|Shalaban Bihar is evidence of the age of Comilla.]]
The Comilla region was once under the reign of [[Gangaridai]] and [[Samatata]] in ancient period.
This district came under the reign of the kings of the [[Harikela]] in the ninth century AD. Lalmai Mainamati was ruled by the [[Deva dynasty]] (eighth century AD) and [[Chandra dynasty]] (during the 10th and mid-11th century AD). In 1732, it became the centre of the Bengal-backed domain of [[Jagat Manikya]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Kilikhar |first=Bidhas Kanti |date=1995 |title=Tripura of the 18th Century with Samsher Gazi Against Feudalism: A Historical Study |location=Agartula |publisher=Chhapa Kathi, Tripura State Tribal Cultural Research Institute and Museum |page=55 |oclc=39290375}}</ref>

The Peasants' Movement against the king of Tripura in 1764, which originally formed under the leadership of [[Shamsher Gazi]] is a notable historical event in Comilla.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nawaz |first=Ali |year=2012 |chapter=Shamsher Gazi |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Shamsher_Gazi |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> It came under the rule of [[East India Company]] in 1765. This district was established as the Tripura district in 1790. It was renamed Comilla in 1960. Chandpur and Brahmanbaria subdivisions of this district were transformed into districts in 1984.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

===British era===
[[File:Mainamati War Cemetery 2018-01-09 (1).jpg|thumb|left|World War II cemetery in [[Mainamati]].]]
Communal tension spread over Comilla when a Muslim was shot in the town during the partition of [[Bengal]] in 1905. On 21 November 1921, [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] composed patriotic songs and tried to awaken the townspeople by protesting the [[Prince of Wales]]'s visit to India.<ref>{{cite book |last=Islam |first=Rafiqul |year=2012 |chapter=Islam, Kazi Nazrul |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Islam,_Kazi_Nazrul |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> During this time, [[Avay Ashram]], as a revolutionary institution, played a significant role. Poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]] visited Comilla at that time. In 1931, approximately 4000 peasants in Mohini village in [[Chauddagram Upazila]] revolted against a land revenue tax. The British Gurkha soldiers fired indiscriminately on the crowd, killing four people.<ref name="Banglapedia-Comilla">{{cite book |last=Siddiqi |first=Mamun |year=2003 |chapter=Comilla District |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Noakhali_Sadar_Upazila |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=First |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] |quote=During this time Avaya Ashram, as a revolutionary institution, played significant role.

Two people were killed and many were wounded. [[Comilla Victoria Government College]] in the city was named in memory of [[Queen Victoria]].
