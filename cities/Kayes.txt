'''Kayes''' ([[Bambara language|Bambara]]: ߞߊߦߌ tr. ''Kayi'', [[Soninke language|Soninké]]: ''Xaayi'') is a city in western [[Mali]] on the [[Sénégal River]] with a population of 127,368 at the 2009 census.  Kayes is the capital of the [[Kayes Region|administrative region]] of the same name. The city is located {{convert|420|km|mi}} northwest of the capital [[Bamako]].

==Toponymy==
There are multiple possible etymologies of the name 'Kayes', all derived from the [[Soninke language]]. These include: the word "kharré", which describes a low humid place that floods in rainy season; the word 'kayé', a type of grass;<ref name = carenews>{{cite web |title=PETITE HISTOIRE DE KAYES |url=https://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/index2.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.carenews.com%2Fcitoyens-agites%2Fnews%2Fpetite-histoire-de-kayes#federation=archive.wikiwix.com&tab=url |website=CareNews |access-date=29 October 2024}}</ref> 'khayé', the Soninke name for the [[rhun palm]].<ref name = maliweb>{{cite web |title=Historique de la ville de Kayes avec Adama Issa Sacko, promoteur – culturel |url=https://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/index2.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.maliweb.net%2Fart-culture%2Fhistorique-de-la-ville-de-kayes-avec-adama-issa-sacko-promoteur-culturel-87165.html#federation=archive.wikiwix.com&tab=url |website=Maliweb |access-date=29 October 2024}}</ref>

==History==
The area around Kayes was historically a part of the [[Soninke people|Soninke]] states of [[Kingdom of Diarra|Diarra]] and [[Gajaaga]]. The important trading center of [[Goundiourou]], known in Arabic sources as Ghiyaru, was just across the river, and was later rebuilt just south of the modern city.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bathily |first1=Abdoulaye |title=Les portes de l'or: le royaume de Galam, Sénégal, de l'ère musulmane au temps des négriers, VIIIe-XVIIIe siècle |date=1989 |publisher=Harmattan |url=https://ereader.perlego.com/1/book/3146221/35 |access-date=27 October 2024}}</ref><ref name = Monteil>Charles Monteil ‘Le Site de Goundiourou’, Bulletin du Comité d'études historiques et scientifiques de l'Afrique occidentale française, Larose (Paris), 1928, http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb34381764h</ref>

Kayes itself was founded in the second half of the 19th century. Guéssé Sidy, a prince of [[Khasso]], established a base there to protect the western approaches to the kingdom's capital, [[Medine, Mali|Medina]].<ref name = carenews/><ref name = maliweb/>

Prior to French colonial expansion, Kayes was still a small village. In 1881 the French chose it as the site for a fort and barracks, the headquarters of the colonial presence in the central Sudan, as Medina was difficult to access by boat. By 1886 the post had been fortified, and by 1889 a market town of 6000 people had grown up around it.<ref name = Bah>Bah Thierno Mouctar.

Paris : Société française d'histoire d'outre-mer, 1981. pp. 988-9. (Bibliothèque d'histoire d'outre-mer. Études, 5-6-2)</ref>

From the beginning, the French began building a [[railway]] linking Kayes, the furthest point reachable by boat on the [[Senegal river]], with [[Bafoulabe]] upstream. This stretch was completed in 1890, and reached to [[Bamako]] in 1904. A [[Dakar-Niger Railway|rail link]] to [[Thiès]] was begun in 1907 which, interrupted by the [[First World War]], was completed in 1923.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chemin de fer Thiès-Niger |url=https://www.entreprises-coloniales.fr/afrique-occidentale/Chfer_Thies-Niger.pdf |format=pdf |website=Les entreprises coloniales françaises |date=14 March 2021 |access-date=5 June 2024}}</ref>.

In 1892, Kayes became the capital of the [[French Sudan]]; Bamako replaced it as the capital, first of the state of [[Haut Sénégal-Niger]] on October 17, 1899, then as the capital of all of French Sudan in 1908.{{cn|date = October 2024}}

During [[World War II]], a portion of [[Poland]]'s [[gold reserve]], evacuated during the [[Invasion of Poland|German-Soviet invasion]] in 1939, was stored for several years in Kayes before being transported to the United States in 1944, to be returned to Poland after the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupation]] and war ended.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ndiaye|first=Bara|year=2006|title=Stosunki polsko-senegalskie.

==Economy and transport==
Kayes lies on the Route Nationale&nbsp;1 (RN1) highway and is {{convert|612|km|mi|abbr=on}} by road from Bamako and {{convert|96|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the border with [[Senegal]]. The town has an international airport ([[Kayes Airport]]), and lies on the [[Dakar-Niger Railway]] which offered regional passenger train service to [[Bamako]] three times a week via Kati and Diamou as of 2013.<ref>Mali Seat 61, http://www.seat61.com/Senegal.htm#.U2JXgMfEc7A</ref> The area is rich in gold and iron.

==Climate==
Kayes has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BSh''). The climate is subject to the [[West African Monsoon]] with all the rainfall occurring  between June and October. August is the wettest month. There is almost no rainfall during the other seven months of the year. The total annual rainfall is around {{convert|650|mm|in|0|disp=or}}.<ref name=wwis>{{citation
