'''Adana'''{{efn|{{IPA|tr|aˈda.na|pronunciation|Adana - TR.wav}}}} is a large city in southern [[Turkey]]. The city is situated on the [[Seyhan River]], {{convert|35|km|0|abbr=on}} inland from the northeastern shores of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It is the administrative seat of the [[Adana Province|Adana province]], and has a population of 1.8 million,<ref name="auto"/> making it the largest city in the [[Mediterranean Region, Turkey|Mediterrenean Region]] of Turkey.

Adana lies in the heart of [[Cilicia]], which was once one of the most important regions of the [[Classical antiquity|classical world]].<ref name=Ancient>{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.worldhistory.org/Cilicia_Campestris/ |title=Cilicia Campestris |first=Joshua J. |last=Mark |encyclopedia=[[World History Encyclopedia]] |access-date=21 February 2020}}</ref><ref name="WorldHistory"/> Home to six million people, Cilicia is an important agricultural area, owing to the large fertile plain of [[Çukurova]].

Twenty-first century Adana is a centre for regional trade, healthcare, and public and private services. Agriculture and logistics are important parts of the economy.

The city is connected to Tarsus and Mersin by [[TCDD Taşımacılık|TCDD]] train.

The closest public airport is [[Çukurova International Airport]].

==Etymology==
The name Adana ({{IPA|tr|aˈda.na|pronunciation|Adana - TR.wav}}; {{Langx|hy|Ադանա}}; {{Langx|el|Άδανα}}) has been used for over four millennia, making it one of the oldest continuously used place names in the world; the first mention of Adana came in Hittite tablets of around 2000 BC. It has had only minor pronunciation changes despite changing political control.{{cn |date=June 2024}}

One theory holds that the city name originates from an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] expression ''a danu'' 'on the river', using the same [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root as the [[Danube]], [[Don (river)|Don]], [[Dnieper]] and [[Donets]].<ref name="Sertkaya">Osman Fikri Sertkaya, " Adana, Begrek, Beyrek ve Elma Kelimelerinin Kökeni Üzerine", Ankara Üniversitesi Dil ve Tarih Coğrafya Fakültesi Türkoloji Dergisi, S.12, (2012), pages 101-103 (Article)</ref>

Greco-Roman legend suggests that the name of Adana originates from ''Adanus'', the son of the Greek god [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], who founded the city next to the river with his brother ''Sarus'', whose name was given to the river.<ref name="Anton">{{cite book |last=Anton |first=Charles |title=Classical Dictionary: Containing an account of the principal proper names mentioned in ancient authors... |publisher=Harper & Brothers |year=1841 |location=New York}}</ref> An older legend, in [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]], [[Sumer]]ian, [[Babylonia]]n, [[Assyria]]n and [[Hittites|Hittite]] mythologies, attributes the name to the [[Weather god|storm and rain god]], [[Hadad|Adad]], who lived in the surrounding forests. Hittite manuscripts found in the area reported the legend. The locals had great admiration for the god and called the region '''Uru Adaniyya''' ("Adana Region") in his honour. The city inhabitants were called [[Denyen|Danuna]].{{cn |date=June 2024}}

In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', the city is mentioned as Adana. For a brief period during the Hellenistic era, it was known as '''Ἀντιόχεια τῆς Κιλικίας''' ("Antioch of Cilicia") and as '''Ἀντιόχεια ἡ πρὸς Σάρον''' ("Antioch on the Sarus"). On some [[cuneiform|cuneiform tablet]]s, the city name was given as '''[[Quwê]]''', while some other sources call it '''Coa''' which could be the place where [[Solomon]] obtained his horses according to the [[Bible]] (I Kings 10:28; II Chronicles 1:16).{{cn |date=June 2024}}

It is also sometimes suggested that the name is related to the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Danaoi]], the name for Greeks of the [[Trojan War]] in [[Homer]] and [[Thucydides]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n1TmVvMwmo4C&dq=Danuniyim+adana+danaoi&pg=PA680|title=The Cambridge Ancient History|first=Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen|last=Edwards|date=15 November 1977|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521086912|via=Google Books}}</ref>

Under [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian rule]], the city was known as '''Ատանա''' (Adana) or '''Ադանա''' (Atana).{{cn |date=June 2024}}

According to Ali Cevad's ''Memalik-i Osmaniye Coğrafya Lügat'' (''Ottoman Geographical Dictionary''), the Muslims of Adana attributed the city's name to Ebu Süleym Ezene, who was appointed as [[Wāli]] by [[Abbasid]] [[Abbasid Caliph|Caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]].<ref>{{cite web |year=1897 |title=Memalik-i Osmaniye Tarih ve Coğrafya Lügatı |url=https://archive.org/stream/memlikiosmaniyen0001al#page/n18/mode/2up |access-date=12 June 2020 |language=tr}}</ref>

Other [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and Islamic sources call the city ''Edene'', ''Azana'' and ''Batana''.{{cn |date=June 2024}}

==History==
Adana is considered to be the oldest city of Cilicia, with a history  going back for eight millennia, making it one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The history of the [[Tepebağ]] [[tumulus]] dates back to the [[Neolithic]], to around 6000 BC, the time of the first human settlements. A place called ''Adana'' is mentioned by name in the [[Sumer]]ian [[Epic of Gilgamesh]].

[[File:Adana_Archaeological_Museum_Hittite_Antropomorphic_terra_cotta_jug_0232.jpg|90px|thumb| Hittite warrior in Adana Archaeological Museum]]

The first people known to have lived in Adana and the surrounding area were the [[Luwians]]. They controlled the Mediterranean coast of Anatolia roughly from 3000 BC to around 1600 BC. Then the [[Hittites]] took over the region which came to be known as [[Kizzuwatna]]. Inhabited by Luwians and [[Hurrians]], Kizzuwatna had an autonomous governance under Hittite protection, but they had a brief period of independence from the 1500s to 1420s BC. According to the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] inscription of [[Kava]], found in [[Hattusa]] ([[Boğazkale]]), [[Kizzuwatna]] was ruling Adana, under the protection of the Hittites, by 1335 BC. From with the collapse of the [[Hittite Empire]] around 1191–1189 BC, native [[Denyen]] [[sea peoples]] took control of Adana and the plain until around 900 BC.<ref name="Philistines">Ann E. Killebrew, 2013, ''The Philistines and Other Sea Peoples in Text and Archaeology'', Society of Biblical Literature, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gBCl2IQfNioC&dq=denyen+sea+peoples+cilicia&pg=PA659 page 659], {{ISBN|978-1589837218}}</ref> Then [[Syro-Hittite states|Neo-Hittite states]] were founded in the region with the [[Quwê]] state centred on Adana. Quwê and other states were protected by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], though they had periods of independence too. After the Greek migration into Cilicia in the 8th century BC, the region was unified under the rule of the [[Mopsus|Mopsos]] dynasty<ref name="Fox-211ff">Fox, Robin Lane (2009) ''Travelling Heroes: In the Epic Age of Homer'' Alfred A. Knopf, New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9k8Frkhiq_MC&pg=PA211 pages 211-224], {{ISBN|978-0-679-44431-2}}</ref> and Adana was established as the capital. Bilingual inscriptions of the ninth and eighth centuries found in [[Mopsuestia]] (modern Yakapınar) were written in [[hieroglyphic Luwian]] and [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]. The Assyrians took control of the regions several times before their collapse in 612 BC.

Cilicians founded the [[Kingdom of Cilicia (ancient)|Kingdom of Cilicia]] in 612 BC with the help of [[Syennesis (5th century)|Syennesis I]]. The kingdom was independent until the invasion of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 549 BC, then became an autonomous [[Cilicia (satrapy)|satrapy]] of the Achaemenids until 401 BC. The uncertain loyalty of Syennessis during the rebellion of [[Cyrus the Younger]] led [[Artaxerxes II]] to abolish the Syennesis administration and replace it with a centrally appointed satrap. Archaeological remains of a procession reveal the existence of [[Persians|Persian]] nobility in Adana.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cilicia-3rd-cent|title=Cilicia|last=Michael Weiskopf|publisher=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2020-07-26}}</ref>

[[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] the Great entered Cilicia through the [[Cilician Gates]] in 333 BC. After defeating the Persians at the [[Battle of Issus]], he installed his own satrap, [[Balakros|Balacrus]], to oversee the region's administration.<ref name="WorldHistory">{{cite web|url=https://www.worldhistory.org/Cilicia/|title=History of Cilicia|publisher=World History Encyclopedia|access-date=20 January 2022}}</ref> His death in 323 BC marked the beginning of the  [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] era, as Greek replaced Luwian as the language of the region. After a short time under [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic dominion]], the [[Seleucid Empire]] took control of the region in 312 BC. Adanan locals adopted a Greek name - ''Antioch on Sarus -'' for the city to demonstrate their loyalty to the Seleucid dynasty. The adopted name and the motifs illustrating the personification of the city seated above the [[Potamoi|river-god]] ''Sarus'' on the city's coins, suggest a special appreciation of the rivers which were a strong part of the Cilician identity.<ref name="MarionMeyer">{{citation| last=Meyer| first=Marion | title=Cilicia as Part of the Seleucid Empire - The Beginning of Municipal Coinage|location=Istanbul| publisher=Institut Français d'Études Anatoliennes-Georges Dumézil| year=2001|pages=505–518}}</ref> The Seleucids ruled Adana for more than two centuries until they were weakened by a civil war which led them to offer allegiance to [[Tigranes the Great|Tigranes II]], the King of Armenia who conquered a vast part of the [[Levant]].

===Romano-Byzantine era ===
[[File:Istanbul - Museo archeol. - Adriano - Da Adana - sec. II d.C. - Foto G. Dall'Orto 28-5-2006 01.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Emperor [[Hadrian]], 2nd century AD]]
The Roman general [[Pompey]] took over the whole of Cilicia and organised it as a [[Cilicia (Roman province)|Roman province]] in 64 BC. Adana was of relatively minor importance during this period, while nearby Tarsus and [[Anazarbus]] were more important [[metropolis]]es. During the era of [[Pompey]], the city was used as a prison for the pirates who frequently ravaged the Cilician coast and disrupted trade. A bridge over the [[Taşköprü (Adana)|Sarus]] (Taşköprü) was built in the early 2nd century, and for several centuries thereafter, the city was a [[wikt:way station|waystation]] on a Roman military road leading to the East.

In the early period of Roman rule, [[Zoroastrianism]], that had been introduced to the region by the Persians, was still observed in Cilicia as was Judaism which attracted many sympathisers. As home to some of the earliest Christian missionary efforts, Cilicia welcomed Christianity more easily than some other provinces.<ref name="WorldHistory" />

After the permanent partitioning of the [[Roman Empire]] in 395 AD, the Adana area became a part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and was probably developed during the time of [[Julian the Apostate]]. With the construction of large bridges, roads, government buildings, irrigation and plantations, Adana and Cilicia became the most developed and important regional trade centres. 
[[File:Adana_Archaeological_Museum_Achilles'_Sarcophagus_170-190_AD_0456.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Achilles' Sarcophagus 170–190 AD]]
Adana became a Christian [[bishopric]], a [[suffragan]] of the [[metropolitan see]] of Tarsus, but was raised to the rank of an autocephalous archdiocese after 680, the year in which its bishop appeared as a simple bishop at the [[Third Council of Constantinople]], but before its listing in a 10th-century ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]'' as an archdiocese. The Bishop Paulinus participated in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Piso was among the [[Arianism]]-inclined bishops at the [[Council of Sardica]] (344) who withdrew and set up their own council at Philippopolis; he later returned to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|orthodoxy]] and signed the profession of [[Nicene Creed|Nicene faith]] at a synod in Antioch in 363. Cyriacus was at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381. Anatolius is mentioned in a letter of Saint [[John Chrysostom]]. Cyrillus was at the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431 and at a synod in Tarsus in 434. Philippus took part in the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451<ref>{{cite book|first1=Richard|last1=Price|first2=Michael|last2=Gaddis|title=The Acts of the Council of Chalcedon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6IUaOOT1G3UC&pg=RA2-PA157|volume= 1|year=2005|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=978-0-85323-039-7|page=122}}</ref> and was a signatory of the joint letter of the bishops of [[Cilicia Prima]] to [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Leo I the Thracian]] in 458 protesting at the murder of [[Proterius of Alexandria]]. Ioannes participated in the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] in 680.<ref>[[Michel Le Quien]], [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_86weAemI-e4C ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], (Paris 1740), Vol. II, coll. 881–882</ref><ref>Pius Bonifacius Gams, [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=65154&dirids=1 ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae''], Leipzig 1931, p. 435</ref> No longer a residential bishopric, Adana is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 825</ref>

=== Period of Byzantine and Islamic rivalry ===
[[File:Cilicia Map by Heinrich Kiepert.png|thumb|300px|[[Cilicia (Roman province)|Provincia Cilicia]]]]
At the [[Battle of Sarus]] in April 625, [[Heraclius]] defeated the forces of [[Shahrbaraz]] of the [[Sasanian Empire]] that were stationed on the east bank of the river, after a fearless charge across the bridge built by the Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]] (now Taşköprü).<ref name=Norwich>{{cite book|last=Norwich |first=John Julius |title=A Short History of Byzantium|publisher= Vintage Books |year=1997 |isbn=0-679-77269-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ElLZK1EOjHsC|author-link=John Julius Norwich}}</ref> During the reign of [[Rashidun Caliphate|Caliph]] [[Umar|Omar]], Muslims who are commanded by [[Khalid ibn Walid]], launched columns to raid Cilicia, going as far as Tarsus, in the autumn of 638.<ref>A.I. Akram, The Sword of Allah: Khalid bin al-Waleed, His Life and Campaigns, Nat. Publishing. House, Rawalpindi (1970) {{ISBN|0-7101-0104-X}}. chapter no:36</ref> The Byzantines defended the region from the encroaching [[Caliphate|Islamic Caliphates]] throughout the 7th century, but it was finally conquered in 704 by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]]. Under Umayyad rule, Cilicia became a [[no man's land]] frontier between Byzantine Christian and Arab Muslim forces.<ref name=Ancient/> In 746, profiting from the unstable conditions in the Umayyad Caliphate, the Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine V]] took control of Adana. The [[Abbasid Caliphate]] took over rule of the region from the Byzantines after [[Al-Mansur]] became caliph in 756. Under Abbasid rule, Muslims started settling in Cilicia for the first time.

Abandoned for more than fifty years, Adana was garrisoned and re-settled from 758 to 760. So that it could form a [[Al-Awasim|thughūr]] on the Byzantine frontier, Cilicia was colonised by the Turkic Sayābija tribe from [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. The city saw rapid economic and cultural growth during the reigns of [[Harun al-Rashid]] and [[Al-Amin]]. Abbasid rule continued for more than two centuries<ref name=AdanaValilik>{{Cite web| url=http://adana.gov.tr|title=Adana İl Yıllığı |first=Kasım|last=Ener| publisher=Adana Valiliği| access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref> until the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] retook control of Adana in 965. The city became part of the [[Seleucia (theme)|Seleucia theme]]. After the great Byzantine defeat at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, the emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] was removed from the throne by a coup. He then gathered an army to regain power but was defeated and had to retreat to Adana. There he was forced to surrender after receiving assurances of his personal safety.

=== Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia ===
[[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish]], the founder of the [[Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]], annexed Adana in his campaign in 1084. During the [[Crusades]], Cilicia had been criss-crossed by invading armies until it was eventually captured by the forces of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian Principality of Cilicia]] in 1132, under its king, [[Leo I, Prince of Armenia|Leo I]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Nicholas|last1=Morton|title=The Crusader States and their Neighbours: A Military History, 1099-1187|year=2020|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0192557988|page=181}}</ref> It was retaken by [[Byzantine]] forces in 1137, but the Armenians regained it again in around 1170. During the Armenian era, Adana continued as a centre for handicrafts and international trade as part of an ancient network from [[Asia-Minor|Asia Minor]] to [[North Africa]], the Near East and [[India]]. [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] merchants frequented the city to sell goods imported through the port at [[Yumurtalık|Ayas]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Denis|last1=Dreisbusch|title=Ermeni Soykırımı ve İslam (1870-1923)|year=2019|publisher=Dönüşüm Yayınları|isbn=978-9758286331|page=459}}</ref> In 1268, the devastating [[1268 Cilicia earthquake|Cilicia earthquake]] destroyed much of the city and eighty years later, in 1348, the [[Black Death]] reached the region and caused severe depopulation. Adana remained part of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] until 1359, when the city was lost to the Turkmen supporting the [[Mamluk Sultanate]] who [[Cilicia]] captured the plain.

===Ramadanid Emirate===
[[File:Adana Castle.jpg|thumb|Forces of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] entering the city. Adana Castle and the city walls seen at back were demolished by them in 1836.]]
The Mamluks built garrisons in Tarsus, [[Yumurtalık|Ayas]] and [[Sarvandikar]] (Savranda), and left the administration of the plain of Adana to [[Oghuz Turks#Üçoks (Three Arrows)|Yüreğir Turks]] who had already formed a Mamluk authorised ''Türkmen Emirate'' in the [[Camili, Yüreğir|Camili]] area, just southeast of Adana, in 1352. The [[Amir|Emir]], Ramazan Bey, designated Adana his capital, and led the Yüreğir Turks as they settled the city. The [[Ramadanid Emirate]], was ''de facto'' independent throughout the 15th century as a result of being a [[Al-Awasim#Mamluk–Turkmen frontier|thughūr]] in Ottoman-Mamluk relations. In 1517, [[Selim I]] incorporated the emirate into the Ottoman Empire after his conquest of the Mamluk state. The Ramadanid Beys held onto the administration of the new Ottoman [[Sanjak]] of Adana by a hereditary title until 1608.

=== Ottoman and Egyptian eras ===

Adana had developed as a hub for cotton trading and had become one of the most prosperous Ottoman cities. New Armenian, Turkish, Greek, [[Chaldean Catholics|Chaldean]], Jewish and Alawite neighbourhoods were founded around what had been a walled city. The [[Adana–Mersin railway|Adana–Mersin railway line]] opened in 1886, connecting Adana to international ports through the port in Mersin.

By the turn of the 20th century, further migration attracted by large-scale industrialisation grew Adana's population to over 107,000: That population was made up of 62,250 Muslims (Turks, Alawites, [[Circassians]], Kurds), 30,000 Armenians, 9,250 [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] (many of whom were [[Chaldean Catholics]]), 5,000 Greeks, 500 [[Arab Christians]] and 200 internationals.<ref name="Matossian">{{citation| last=Matossian| first=Bedross Der| title=1909:The Adana Massacres|location=New York| publisher=Greenhaven Publishing| year=2018|pages=25–57| isbn=978-1534501201}}</ref>

====Adana massacre of 1909====
[[File:The City of Adana.svg|thumb|Quarters that were burnt during the massacre of 1909]]
In the early 20th century the local economy thrived and the Armenian population doubled as people fled the [[Hamidian Massacres|Hamidian massacres]]. When the [[Young Turk Revolution|revolution]] of July 1908 brought about the end of [[Abdul Hamid II]]'s autocratic rule, the Armenian community felt empowered to imagine an autonomous Cilicia. The [[Committee of Union and Progress|CUP's]] post-revolution mismanagement of the [[vilayet]]s caused the pro-diversity Vali Bahri Pasha to be removed from office in late 1908. He was replaced by the weak Cevad Bey. Taking advantage of this, Bağdadizade Abdülkadir (later Paksoy), the local leader of the Cemiyet-i Muhammediye, took almost complete control of the local government and led an action plan to "punish" Armenians throughout Cilicia. Rumours of an upcoming Armenian attack, raised tension in the Turkish neighbourhoods. As soon as news of the [[31 March Incident|countercoup]] reached Cilicia, enraged members of the Cemiyet-i Muhammediye<ref name="Agos">{{cite web|url=http://www.agos.com.tr/tr/yazi/11235/106-yildonumunde-adana-katliaminin-ardindaki-gercekler|title=106. yıldönümünde Adana Katliamı'nın ardındaki gerçekler|date=4 October 2015 |publisher=Agos Gazetesi|access-date=12 March 2020}}</ref> and dissatisfied peasants left out of work by mechanisation flocked to the city on market day. After staying overnight in the city, the groups and their local supporters started attacking Armenian shops on the morning of 14 April 1909. Later in the day the attacks were also directed at Armenian dwellings and spread to the rest of Cilicia. Armed Armenians defended themselves and the clashes lasted until April 17.

[[File:Survivors_of_the_Adana_Massacre.jpg|thumb|left|Survivors of the massacre amid ruins of their houses]]
After a week of silence, 850 soldiers from regiments of the Ottoman Army arrived in the city on April 25. Shots were fired at the campground and a rumour immediately spread that the Armenians had opened fire from a church tower. Without even investigating the rumour, the military commander Mustafa Remzi Pasha directed soldiers and [[bashi-bazouk]]s towards the Armenian quarters and for three days they shot people, destroyed buildings and burned down Christian neighbourhoods. The pogroms of 25–27 April were on a much greater scale than the clashes of 14–17 April, and almost all the casualties were Christian.<ref>{{citation|last=Yeghiayan|first=Puzant|title=Ատանայի Հայոց Պատմութիւն [The History of the Armenians of Adana]|location=Beirut|publisher=Union of Armenian Compatriots of Adana|year=1970|pages=211–272|language=hy}}</ref>

The [[Adana massacre]] of April 1909 resulted in the deaths of 18,839 Armenians, 1,250 Greeks, 850 Assyrians, 422 Chaldeans and 620 Muslims. Adding in the roughly 2,500 [[Saimbeyli|Hadjinian]] and other seasonal workers who disappeared, the death toll in the entire [[Vilayet of Adana|Vilayet]] is estimated to have been around 25,500. Over the summer 2,000 children died of [[dysentery]] and a few thousand adults died of injuries or from epidemics. The massacre orphaned 3,500 children and caused heavy destruction of Christian properties.<ref>Raymond H. Kévorkian, "The Cilician Massacres, April 1909" in ''Armenian Cilicia'', eds. [[Richard G.

He quickly rebuilt relations with the surviving Armenian community and gathered financial support to found a new neighbourhood  for Armenians called ''Çarçabuk'' (now Döşeme). He also ordered the construction of [[Adana Dârüleytâm|two orphanages]] and the restoration of destroyed buildings.<ref name="Agos" />

The Cilicia section of the [[Berlin–Baghdad railway]] had opened in 1912, connecting Adana to the Middle East. Within a few years, the city had regained its momentum and by the turn of 1915, the Armenian population numbered up to 30,000, not far short of the figure from before 1909.

====Armenian genocide====
Early in May 1915, Vali Ismail Hakkı Bey received an order from [[Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul|İstanbul]]) to deport the Armenians of Adana. The Vali was able to delay the deportations and let the Armenians sell their movable assets to acquire money for the journey. The first convoy of deportees consisting of more than 4,000 Armenians left the city on May 20. The [[Holy See of Cilicia|Catholicos of Cilicia]], [[Sahak II of Cilicia|Sahak II]], wrote a letter to Djemal Pasha, the then Syria-Cilicia General Vali to prevent further deportations and the chief secretary Kerovpe Papazian met the pasha in [[Aley]] in Lebanon in early June and delivered the message of the Catholicos. Djemal Pasha immediately wired the Vali ordering him not to deport more Armenians. As a result of his efforts, the Adana Armenians earned a stay of execution for the summer, while the rest of the Cilician Armenians were being deported and hundreds of thousands of exhausted Armenian deportees from Western Anatolia were passing through the city. Armenian intellectuals  [[Rupen Zartarian]], [[Sarkis Minassian]], [[Nazaret Daghavarian]], [[Harutiun Jangülian]], and [[Karekin Khajag]], who were [[Deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915|deported from Constantinople on April 24th]], were kept in custody in the Vilayet offices for a few days. They failed to be able to arrange a meeting with the Catholicos at the [[Surp Asdvadzadzin Cathedral (Adana)|Cathedral]], their last attempt at survival. Later in June, two prominent leaders, [[Krikor Zohrab]] and [[Vartkes Serengülian]], were also kept in the city during their final journey towards [[Diyarbakır]].<ref name="Kevorkian2">{{cite book|last=Kevorkian| first=Raymond| title=The Armenian Genocide: Complete History |location= London| publisher=I.B.Taurus & Co.Ltd. | year=2011| isbn=978-1848855618}}</ref>
[[File:Deportation trains to Syria.png|thumb|225px|Armenians being loaded onto the trains for deportation to Syria]]
The Minister of the Interior, [[Talaat Pasha]], wanted to end the exemption of Adana Armenians and sent his second in command, Ali Munif, to the city in mid-August to order the resumption of the deportations. Ali Munif immediately deported 250 families who were accused of insurrection. Before the remaining Armenians were deported, the Vali again arranged for them to sell their assets. As almost a third of the city's residents were selling their belongings, the city must have seemed like the site of a massive clearance sale. The deportation of 5,000 Armenian families in eight convoys started on 2 September 1915 and continued until the end of October. One thousand craftsmen, state officers and army personnel and their families were exempted from deportation. Unlike the deportees of other Vilayets, many of Adana's Armenians were sent to [[Damascus]] and further south, thereby avoiding the [[Deir ez-Zor Camps|death camps of Deir ez-Zor]], at the request of Djemal Pasha.<ref name="Kevorkian2" /> During the course of the [[Armenian genocide]], the death rate of the roughly 25,000 Armenians deported from Adana in 1915 was a lot lower than that of deportees from other regions for three main reasons: there were no reports of direct killings in and around the city; many were deported to the Damascus area; and some had money to keep them going.

The [[Armistice of Mudros]], signed on 30 October 1918, ended Ottoman participation in [[World War I]]. The terms of the armistice ceded control of Cilicia to [[France]]. In December the French government sent four battalions of the [[French Armenian Legion|Armenian Legion]] to take over Adana and oversee the repatriation of more than 170,000 Armenians to Cilicia. Returning Armenians negotiated with France to establish an autonomous ''State of Cilicia'' and [[Mihran Damadian]], the chief negotiator for the Armenians, signed a provisional ''Constitution of Cilicia'' in 1919.<ref name="HrantAdana">{{cite web |title=Ermeni Kültür Varlıklarıyla Adana |url=https://hrantdink.org/attachments/article/1398/Adana_Raporu_new.pdf |access-date=12 March 2020 |publisher=HDV Yayınları}}</ref> Pre-war life resumed with the re-opening of churches, schools, cultural centres and businesses.

However, the French forces were spread thinly across Cilicia and the villages to which people returned came under attack from the Turkish [[Kuva-yi Milliye]]. The costs and difficulties associated with the repatriation process, and growing Arab nationalism within the Syria mandate forced the French High Commissioners to meet the Turkish leader, [[Mustafa Kemal Pasha]], several times in late 1919 and early 1920, resulting in a halt to the deployment of extra forces to Cilicia.<ref name="Güven">Cemal Güven, ''Milli Mücadele'de Mustafa Kemal Paşa'nın Yabancılarla temas ve görüşmeleri'', Eğitim Yayınevi, 2012, {{ISBN|978-605-4392-80-3}}</ref> A truce arranged on 28 May 1920 between the French and the Kemalists, led the French forces to retreat south of the [[Mersin]]-[[Osmaniye]] railroad.

===Modern Turkey===
On 15 April 1923, just before the signing of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], the Turkish government enacted the "Law of Abandoned Properties" which confiscated the properties of Armenians and Greeks who were not present there. Adana became one of the cities with the most confiscated property, which meant that [[muhacir]]s (immigrants) from the Balkans and [[Crete]], as well as migrants from [[Kayseri]] and [[Darende]] were resettled in the Armenian and Greek neighbourhoods, with more modest pieces of land, houses and workshops distributed to them. The large farms, factories, stores and mansions were granted to Kayseri notables (e.g. Nuh Naci Yazgan, Nuri Has, Mustafa Özgür) and to local nationalists (e.g. Sefa Özler, Ali Münif) as promised at the [[Sivas Congress]] by Mustafa Kemal (later [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]]).<ref name="Cezmi3">{{cite web|url=http://birdeburadandinleyin.blogspot.com/2012/02/sabanclarn-imparator-olmas-cezmi.html|title=Sabancıların İmparator olması|access-date=30 April 2020}}</ref> Within a decade, the city experienced drastic demographic change, socially and economically, and turned into an almost entirely Muslim/Turkish city.<ref name="HrantAdana" /> The remaining Jews and Christians were hammered by the burden of the [[Varlık Vergisi|Wealth Tax]] in 1942, causing most to leave Adana, selling their properties at way below their actual value to families like the [[Sabancı family|Sabancıs]], who built their wealth on such confiscated or undervalued properties.

On 27 June 1998, the city was hit by a [[1998 Adana–Ceyhan earthquake|6.2 magnitude earthquake]] which killed 145 and left 1500 people wounded and many thousand homeless in the city centre and in Ceyhan district.

==Geography==
[[File:Seyhan River, Çatalan 05.jpg|thumb|The [[Seyhan River]] in Çatalan (North of Adana)]]

Adana is located on the [[37th parallel north]] on the northeastern edge of the Mediterranean, occupying the center of the [[Çukurova|Cilician plain]] ({{Langx|tr|Çukurova|lit=the Trough Plain}}); a relatively large stretch of flat, fertile land that lies southeast of the [[Taurus Mountains]].

The [[Seyhan River|Seyhan]] (likely from {{Langx|grc|Σάρος|translit=Sáros}}) divides Adana into its two metropolitan districts, and is the main source for Adana's fertile [[Alluvium|alluvial]] soils, while also being responsible for the region's proclivity to regular winter and spring floods, which affected the city until embankments were built in the 1900s.<ref>A.F. Baldwin (chief editor) {{google books|tV5JAQAAMAAJ|Department of Commerce and Labor, Bureau of Manufactures, Daily Consular and Trade Reports, Issues 1-75 (1910)|page=662}}</ref> The [[Seyhan Dam]], completed in 1956, was constructed for hydroelectric power, along with plans to irrigate the lower Çukurova plain more regularly than the floodplain could naturally provide. Therefore, two irrigation channels now flow into the plain, crossing the city centre from east to west.

Heading west across Cilicia from Adana, the path to [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] crosses the foothills of the Taurus Mountains, eventually reaching an altitude of nearly {{convert|1200|m|ft|sigfig=1}} while passing through the [[Cilician Gates]] ({{Langx|tr|Gülek Boğazı}}), a rocky mountain pass functioning as the main artery to the [[Central Anatolia Region|Turkish hinterland]].

Adana Metropolitan Municipality covers an area of {{convert|30|km2|abbr=on}} around the City Hall.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/kanunlar/k5216.html| title= 5216 sayılı Büyükşehir Belediyesi Kanunu|language=tr|publisher=Grand National Assembly of Turkey | access-date=26 July 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100727174410/http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/kanunlar/k5216.html| archive-date= 27 July 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> Four levels of government are involved in the administration of the city; national, provincial, metropolitan and district municipalities.The [[Politics of Turkey|Government of Turkey]] in Ankara holds most of the power: health, education, the police and many other city-related services are administered by [[Ankara]] through an appointed Governor. The national government is also the lawmaker, adjudicator and auditor of all the other levels of government and the neighbourhood administration. Municipal governance is run via a two-tier structure: the Metropolitan Municipality forms the upper tier and the district municipalities form the lower tier. The Metropolitan Municipality takes care of construction and the maintenance of major roads and parks, and operates local transit and fire services.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/kanunlar/k5216.html| title = 5216 sayılı Büyükşehir Belediyesi Kanunu|publisher=Grand National Assembly of Turkey | access-date=26 July 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100727174410/http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/kanunlar/k5216.html| archive-date= 27 July 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> The district municipalities are responsible for neighbourhood streets, parks, garbage collections and cemetery services. The district municipalities are further divided into neighbourhoods ([[mahalle]]) administrations, the smallest administrative units of the city.

===Metropolitan municipality===
[[File:Orhan_Kemal_Cultural_Centre.JPG|thumb|[[Orhan Kemal Cultural Centre]] belonging to Çukurova Municipality ]]

Adana Municipality was incorporated in 1871 though the city continued to be governed under the [[muhtesip]] system until 1877 by the first mayor Gözlüklü Süleyman Efendi. Modern municipal governance began with the second mayor [[Kirkor Bezdikyan]] and his successor Sinyor Artin. Roads were widened and paved with cobblestones, drainage canals and trenches were cut, and the first municipal regulations were put into effect. After the founding of the republic in 1923, major infrastructure projects were carried out and the first planned neighbourhoods were built to the north of the city. Turhan Cemal Beriker served as mayor and governor from 1926 to 1938. With the completion of the [[Seyhan Dam]] in 1956, the city saw explosive growth and the then prime minister [[Adnan Menderes]] showed special interest in Adana, initiating large-scale infrastructure projects like citywide underground sewer systems and rezoning residential areas. Since 1984, the cityscape has seen great change with the revitalisation of the Seyhan river and the construction of large parks and boulevards.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.adana.bel.tr/adana-buyuksehir-belediyesi-tarihcesi-sayfa.html | title= Adana Büyükşehir Belediyesi Tarihçesi | language= tr | publisher= Adana Metropolitan Municipality | access-date= 26 July 2010 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100731085938/http://www.adana.bel.tr/adana-buyuksehir-belediyesi-tarihcesi-sayfa.html | archive-date= 31 July 2010 | url-status= dead | df= dmy-all}}</ref>

Metropolitan Municipality Law was introduced in 1989 when municipal governance was split between the metropolitan municipality and the district municipalities. Adana Municipality became the Metropolitan Municipality and two new district municipalities - Seyhan and Yüreğir - were founded. Karaisalı was annexed to the city in 2006, while the Çukurova and Sarıçam districts were founded in 2008 by partitioning the Seyhan and Yüreğir districts. On 3 February 2012, [[Karataş]] Municipal Council agreed to amalgamate with Adana, hence [[Karataş]] will become the city's sixth district after the transition process is complete.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://haberler.com/karatas-belediyesi-buyuksehir-e-baglanma-karari-3327420-haberi/| title= Karataş Belediyesi Büyükşehir'e Bağlanma Kararı Aldı.| date= 3 February 2012|language=tr|publisher=Haberler.com | access-date=3 February 2012}}</ref>

The Metropolitan Municipality consists of three organs: the Metropolitan Council, the Mayor and the Encümen or Executive Committee. Each district municipal council elects one-fifth of their members to represent it at the metropolitan council. Thus, the metropolitan council consists of 35 councillors, ten from Seyhan district, eight from Yüreğir, eight from Çukurova, six from Sarıçam, two from Karaisalı and the metropolitan mayor who is elected directly by the voters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adana.bel.tr/belediye-meclisi-uyesi-sayfa.html|title=Adana Büyükşehir Belediyesi Meclis Üyeleri|language=tr|publisher=Adana Metropolitan Municipality|access-date=27 July 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915142641/http://adana.bel.tr/belediye-meclisi-uyesi-sayfa.html|archive-date=15 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The executive committee consists of ten members, five being metropolitan councillors and the other five directors at the metropolitan hall who are appointed by the metropolitan mayor.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.adana.bel.tr/encumen-uyeleri-sayfa.html | title= Adana Büyükşehir Belediyesi Encümeni | language= tr | publisher= Adana Metropolitan Municipality | access-date= 27 July 2010 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100612153829/http://www.adana.bel.tr/encumen-uyeleri-sayfa.html | archive-date= 12 June 2010 | url-status= dead | df= dmy-all}}</ref>

===Districts===

The City of Adana consists of the urban areas of the four metropolitan districts; Seyhan, Yüreğir, Çukurova and Sarıçam. Seyhan district is fully within the city limits whereas the Yüreğir, Çukurova and Sarıçam districts have rural areas outside the city.

[[Seyhan|Seyhan district]], west of the Seyhan River, is the city's cultural and business centre. The [[State road D400 (Turkey)|D-400]] state road (also called Turhan Cemal Beriker Boulevard within the city limits) divides the district into north and south. Seyhan north of the D-400 is the most economically developed part of the city. Hotels, cultural centres, commercial and public buildings line the D-400. The Old Town to the south of the D-400 is the shopping district with a mixture of traditional and modern shops. South of the old town is a low-income residential area.

[[Çukurova, Adana|Çukurova district]] is a modern residential district that lies north of Seyhan district and south of the Seyhan Reservoir. It was planned in the mid-1980s to direct the [[urban sprawl]] towards land north of the city. Called '''New Adana''', the project consisted of 200,000 homes including [[villa]]s along the lake shore and high-rise apartment blocks along the wide, newly opened boulevards of Turgut Özal, Süleyman Demirel and Kenan Evren.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adana.bel.tr/yeni-adana-projesi-sayfa.html|title=Yeni Adana Projesi|language=tr|publisher=Adana Metropolitan Municipality|access-date=4 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915124243/http://adana.bel.tr/yeni-adana-projesi-sayfa.html|archive-date=15 September 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

[[Yüreğir|Yüreğir district]], east of the river, consists mainly of large-scale industry and low-income residential areas. With the construction of new bridges over the river and the extension of the metro line, Yüreğir became increasingly important, with the Adana Court of Justice re-locating to the district and a 47.5-hectare health campus planned for the Kazım Karabekir neighbourhood.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.haber01.com/SA%C4%9ELIK-KAMPUSU-YURE%C4%9EIR-E-10039.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181215122424/http://www.haber01.com/SA%C4%9ELIK-KAMPUSU-YURE%C4%9EIR-E-10039.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 15 December 2018 | title = Sağlık Kampüsü Yüreğir'e | publisher = haber01.com | access-date = 4 September 2010}}</ref> An extensive urban redevelopment plan will also convert the Sinanpaşa, Yavuzlar, Köprülü and Kışla neighbourhoods into modern residential areas.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kentselhaber.com/V10/News/114515/Adana-da-kentsel-donusum-basladi | title = Adana'da Kentsel Donusum | publisher = Kentsel Haber | access-date = 18 August 2009 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110713143606/http://www.kentselhaber.com/V10/News/114515/Adana-da-kentsel-donusum-basladi | archive-date = 13 July 2011 | df = dmy-all}}</ref>

The district of [[Sarıçam]] lies north and east of Yüreğir and consists of former municipalities that were amalgamated into the City of Adana in 2008. Some of the city's larger institutions are in Sarıçam such as [[Çukurova University]], the [[Incirlik Air Base|İncirlik Air Base]] and the Organised Industrial Region.

===Neighbourhoods===
Individual neighbourhoods ([[mahalle]]) are administrative units within the district municipalities and are administered by the [[muhtar (title)|muhtar]] (headman) and the Neighborhood Seniors Council. Although elected by the neighbourhood residents, the muhtar is not granted any powers but functions as an administrator of the national government. The muhtar can raise neighbourhood issues with the district municipality and has a seat at the Adana City Assembly, an umbrella organisation for the coordination of public institutions in the city.<ref>{{citation|last=Koçberber|first=Seyit|year=2007|title=Yeni Belediye Yasası ile Mahalle Yönetimi|publisher=Sayıştay Journal|volume=56|pages=103–114|language=tr}}</ref> Even though neighbourhood administrations cannot provide social services nor provide funding to increase the involvement of residents in local issues, many residents still identify strongly with their neighbourhoods.

There are a total of 254 neighbourhoods in the city. [[Seyhan#Neighborhoods|Seyhan has 99 neighbourhoods]], 69 of them in the original urban area and 30 in the neighbourhoods of the former municipalities and the former villages that were converted into neighbourhoods. [[Yüreğir#Neighborhoods|Yüreğir has 99 neighbourhoods]], 38 in the urban area and 61 in the rural. There are [[Sarıçam#Neighborhoods|29 neighbourhoods in Sarıçam]], [[Çukurova, Adana#Neighborhoods|16 neighbourhoods in Çukurova]] and 11 in Karaisalı district. A neighbourhood population can range from 150 to 63,000.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://adana.bel.tr/ilce-mahalle-ve-muhtarliklar-sayfa.html| title = Adana Kenti İlçe Mahalle ve Muhtarlıklar| language = tr| publisher = Metropolitan Municipality| access-date = 27 July 2010| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100915124624/http://adana.bel.tr/ilce-mahalle-ve-muhtarliklar-sayfa.html| archive-date = 15 September 2010| df = dmy-all}}</ref> Some neighbourhoods, especially in the Çukurova district, are very large—almost the size of a town—making access to muhtars difficult.

[[Tepebağ]], [[Kayalıbağ, Seyhan|Kayalıbağ]], [[Kuruköprü, Seyhan|Kuruköprü]], [[Sarıyakup, Seyhan|Sarıyakup]] and [[Alidede, Seyhan|Alidede]] are the historical neighbourhoods of Adana. The planned neighbourhoods of the Republican era - [[Reşatbey]], [[Cemalpaşa, Seyhan|Cemalpaşa]], [[Kurtuluş, Seyhan|Kurtuluş]] and [[Çınarlı, Sarıçam|Çınarlı]] - form the core of the city's cultural life. [[Güzelyalı, Çukurova|Güzelyalı]], [[Karslılar, Çukurova|Karslılar]] and [[Kurttepe]] are scenic neighbourhoods overlooking the [[Seyhan]] reservoir.

A major centre for grain and cotton production in the Ottoman period, Adana was one of Turkey's first industrialised cities and is now one of its most economically developed cities.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Chen |first=Yuan Julian |date=2021-10-11 |title=Between the Islamic and Chinese Universal Empires: The Ottoman Empire, Ming Dynasty, and Global Age of Explorations |url=https://www.academia.edu/59068575 |journal=Journal of Early Modern History |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=422–456 |doi=10.1163/15700658-bja10030 |s2cid=244587800 |issn=1385-3783}}</ref> A mid-size trading city until the mid-1800s, the city attracted European traders after the United States, a major cotton supplier, became embroiled in its [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Cilician farmers exported agricultural products for the first time and started building up capital. By the start of the 20th century, factories, almost all of them processing cotton, began to operate here. The coming of the Republic accelerated industrialisation as closed plants were re-activated and state-owned plants opened. With the construction of the [[Seyhan Dam]] and improvements in agricultural techniques, there was an explosive growth in agricultural production during the 1950s. Large-scale industry grew up along the D-400 highway and the Karataş road. A service industry, especially banking, developed during this period.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.aksiyon.com.tr/aksiyon/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=27748 | title = Bekleyen dev: Adana | publisher = Aksiyon | access-date = 2 February 2012 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140104023320/http://www.aksiyon.com.tr/aksiyon/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=27748 | archive-date = 4 January 2014 | df = dmy-all}}</ref> Rapid economic growth continued until the mid-1980s and movie makers were attracted to the region.

Extensive [[neo-liberal]] policies adopted by then Prime Minister [[Turgut Özal]] to centralise Turkey's economy caused almost all the Adana-based companies to move their headquarters to [[Istanbul]]. The decline in cotton planting raised the cost of raw material for manufacturing, and the city saw a wave of plant closures starting from the mid-1990s.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://haber.gazetevatan.com/Adanada_sanayi_tasfiye_oluyor/227177/2/Haber | title = Adana'da sanayi tasfiye oluyor.(Turkish) | publisher = Vatan Gazetesi | access-date = 9 March 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130616043138/http://haber.gazetevatan.com/Adanada_sanayi_tasfiye_oluyor/227177/2/Haber | archive-date = 16 June 2013 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all}}</ref> Young professionals fled the city, contributing to Adana's unenviable status as the country's top [[brain drain]] city.

In 2010, unemployment in the city reached a record 19.1 percent.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.radikal.com.tr/Radikal.aspx?aType=RadikalDetayV3&ArticleID=1053946&CategoryID=80 | title = Adana'da 5 kişiden biri işsiz(Turkish) |publisher=Radikal Gazetesi | access-date=24 June 2011}}</ref> After 20 years of stagnation, Adana's economy is starting to pick up again with investments in the tourism and service industries, and the wholesale and retail sectors, and the city is being re-shaped as a regional centre.

Adana was named among the 25 ''European Regions of the Future'' for 2006/2007 by ''[[Foreign Direct Investment]]'' magazine. Chosen alongside [[İzmit|Kocaeli]], Adana scored the highest points for cost effectiveness against Kocaeli's points for infrastructure development, while the two towns tied for points in the categories of human resources and quality of life.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fdimagazine.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1544/EUROPEAN_CITIES___REGIONS_OF_THE_FUTURE_2006_07.html | title = European Regions of the Future | work = Foreign Direct Investment Magazine | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070311042032/http://www.fdimagazine.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1544/EUROPEAN_CITIES___REGIONS_OF_THE_FUTURE_2006_07.html | archive-date = 11 March 2007 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all}}</ref>

'''The Adana Chamber of Commerce (ATO)''' was founded in 1894 to guide and regulate the cotton trade and it is one of the oldest of its kind in Turkey.

===Agriculture===
Adana is the marketing and distribution centre for the Çukurova agricultural region, where cotton, wheat, corn, soy bean, barley, grapes and citrus fruits are produced in great quantities. Adana's farmers produce half of Turkey's corn and soy beans.

Two-thirds of Adana's residents live west of the Seyhan River, where the city was first founded. East of the river [[urban sprawl]] has been restricted by large institutions such as Çukurova University and the Incirlik Air Base.

According to [[Evliya Çelebi]], during the 17th century, the town was mostly composed of Turkomans but also included Arabs, Greeks, Armenians, and Jews.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Çelebi |first1=Evliya |title=Evliya Çelebi Seyahatnamesi |year=1896 |page=338 |publisher=[stnbl] dm Maba'asi |url=https://archive.org/details/evliyaelebiseyah09evli/page/338/mode/2up |access-date=6 December 2022 |quote=Ve halkı ekseriya بله dir yani Oğuz tayifesidir(...)

The demographics of the city changed significantly in the 1990s after the massive migration of Kurds, many of them having been forced to leave their villages in the [[Southeastern Anatolia Region|southeast]] at the peak of the [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict#Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present)|Turkey–PKK conflict]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/Radikal.aspx?aType=RadikalYazar&ArticleID=1025234&Yazar=SIRRI%20S%DCREYYA%20%D6NDER&Date=24.10.2010&CategoryID=97 |title=1990'larda kimine göre 2.5 milyon, kimine göre 4.5 milyon Kürt göç ettirildi.(Turkish)|work=Radikal |access-date=28 January 2012}}</ref> The Conos, a tribe of [[Romani people]] of [[Romania]], settled in Adana during the [[Balkan Wars]]; today they mainly live around the Sinanpaşa neighbourhood. Around 8,000 [[Romani people]] live in Adana Province.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gezily.com/adana-gezilecek-yerler |title=Adana Gezilecek Yerler |date=7 August 2020 |publisher=Gezily }}</ref> There is also a sizeable community of migrants from the [[Balkans]] and [[Caucasus|Caucasia]], who settled in Adana before and during the Balkan Wars.

There were 172,000 Armenians in the Adana area in 1921, just before the Cilicia Evacuation. Around 82,000 of them were not sent into exile which explains why they remained in Adana and assimilated into Turkish society.<ref name="Üstün" /> Ten thousand to 15,000 of the descendants, who are known as [[Crypto-Armenians]], still practise their Armenian/Christian culture behind closed doors.<ref>{{cite news|last=Söylemez |first=Haşim |title=Türkiye'de, Araplaşan binlerce Ermeni de var |url=http://www.aksiyon.com.tr/aksiyon/haber-17376-34-turkiyede-araplasan-binlerce-ermeni-de-var.html |access-date=16 June 2013 |newspaper=Aksiyon |date=27 August 2007 |language=tr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603043528/http://www.aksiyon.com.tr/aksiyon/haber-17376-34-turkiyede-araplasan-binlerce-ermeni-de-var.html |archive-date=3 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> There are also many descendants of the Armenian children given to orphanages or to Muslim families for fostering in 1909 and 1915.

Before 2003, the community numbered up to 22,000 but it declined after many troops were stationed in [[Iraq]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tumgazeteler.com/?a=4126756 |title=Amerikalı asker sayısı azaldı.

As with other cities on the Mediterranean and Aegean coasts, Adana has a strong [[secularism|secularist]] population. Amongst the people of faith, the majority of Turks, most of the Kurds and some of the Arabs are Sunni Muslim. Adana is also a stronghold of [[Alevism]], many Alevis having moved to the city from [[Kahramanmaraş]] after the [[Maraş massacre|Maraş Massacre]] of [[Maraş Massacre|1978]]. Most of the Arabs of Adana are [[Alawites in Turkey|Alawites]] and often confused with Alevis. Alawite Arabs are known locally as [[Nusayri]] or ''Fellah''. Adana also has a tiny community of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and a few [[Jews|Jewish]] families.

==Local attractions==
[[File:Taşköprü'nün_Panoramik_Fotoğrafı.jpg|thumb|center|700px|{{center|Panoramic view of Stone Bridge (Taşköprü) in Adana. Built in the Roman era, it is a prominent symbol of the city.}}]]

===Architecture===
[[File:Atatürk_Museum_3_(33592688243).jpg|thumb|left|Historic rowhouses, Tepebağ]]
[[File:Adana_old_market_and_clocktower_(34271945161)_(2).jpg|thumb|[[Büyük Saat|The Great Clock Tower]] (Büyük Saat Kulesi)]]

The first traces of settlement in the quarter of [[Tepebağ]], can be traced to the [[neolithic age|Neolithic Age]]. The quarter is next to the Taşköprü stone bridge and on a hill which gave it its name Tepebağ, meaning 'garden on the hill'. The city administration has launched a campaign to preserve the Ottoman houses near the river. A house where Atatürk stayed on Seyhan Caddesi now houses the [[Atatürk Museum (Adana)|Atatürk Museum]].

Adana's golden age for architecture was the late 15th and 16th centuries when the [[Ramadanids|Ramadanid principality]] chose it as their capital. The city grew rapidly during that period with many new neighbourhoods and most of the historical landmarks being built during this period. Thus [[Mamluk architecture|Mamluk]] and [[Seljuqid|Seljukid]] styles of architecture are dominant in Adana's architectural history. [[Stone Bridge (Adana)|Taşköprü]] is the only remaining landmark from the Roman-Byzantine era, while a few public buildings were built during Ottoman rule.

=== Mosques ===
[[File:Adana Sabancı Merkez Camii - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Sabancı Merkez Camii|Sabancı Central Mosque]] (Sabancı Merkez Cami)]]
The [[Ulu Cami (Adana)|Ulu Cami]], a [[külliye]] built in 1541 during the Ramadanid era, is the most interesting medieval mosque to survive in Adana along with its [[madrasah|medrese]] and [[türbe]]. The mosque is made from black and white marble with decorative window surrounds and is famous for the 16th century [[Iznik]] tiles lining the interior. The minaret features unique Mamluk decoration and an orthogonal floor plan.

The [[Yağ Camii]] was originally built as the Church of St. James, then converted into a mosque by Ramazanoğlu Halil Bey in 1501.<ref>{{cite web |title=Adana |url=http://www.adonisistanbul.com/adonis/page.php?58 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311070341/http://www.adonisistanbul.com/adonis/page.php?58 |archive-date=11 March 2010 |publisher=Adonis İstanbul |df=dmy-all}}</ref> His successor Piri Mehmet Paşa added its [[minaret]] in 1525 and its [[madrasah|medrese]] in 1558. It is in the [[Seljuqid|Seljukid]] Grand Mosque style and has an attractive gate made of yellow stone.

'''The Yeni Camii (New Mosque)''' was built in 1724 by Abdülrezzak Antaki, and is still known to some as the Antaki Mosque. The influence of [[Mamluk architecture]] is visible. A rectangular building, it has interesting stonework on its south walls.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yeni Camii |url=http://www.kenthaber.com/akdeniz/adana/seyhan/Rehber/cami-ve-mescitler/yeni-cami |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005030129/http://www.kenthaber.com/akdeniz/adana/seyhan/Rehber/cami-ve-mescitler/yeni-cami |archive-date=5 October 2009 |publisher=Kenthaber Kültür Kurulu |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The Alemdar Mescidi, Şeyh Zülfi Mescidi, Kızıldağ Ramazanoğlu Mosque and Hasan Aga Camii (a 16th-century wooden mosque constructed without using nails) are also of historic value.

The huge and prominent [[Sabancı Merkez Camii]] (Sabancı Central Mosque) on the west bank of the Seyhan river is Adana's most visited mosque and one of the largest mosques in the Middle East. Built following Ottoman [[Ottoman Architecture|architectural traditions]], the mosque was opened in 1998 to accommodate up to 28,500 worshippers. It has six minarets, four of them 99 meters high. Its dome has a diameter of 32 meters and is 54 meters above the prayer hall. Near the Seyhan Bridge, the mosque is visible over a wide area.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sabancı Merkez Camii |url=http://www.sabancivakfi.org/tr/?kalicieser/sos/adana/sabanci_merkez_cami/adana_sabanci_merkez_cami.html |publisher=Sabancı Vakfı}}</ref>

=== Museums and art galleries ===
[[Adana Archaeological Museum]] originally opened in 1924 as one of Turkey's first ten museums. It moved to the west corner of Seyhan Bridge in 1972. The museum exhibits archeological works from all over the Çukurova. Notable exhibits include two statues of Augustus, the Achilles Sarcophagus depicting the [[Trojan War]] and statues found in the ancient cities of [[Magarsa|Magarsus]] and Augusta. In 2019 it moved to a completely new location in an abandoned textiles factory.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sabah |first=Daily |date=2017-05-19 |title=Turkey's largest museum complex unveiled in Adana |url=https://www.dailysabah.com/turkey/2017/05/19/turkeys-largest-museum-complex-unveiled-in-adana |access-date=2022-12-06 |website=Daily Sabah |language=en-US}}</ref> A mosaic from [[Mopsuestia|Misis]] (Yaprakpınar) depicting Noah and twenty-three birds that he took into the Ark during the Flood has been moved into the new museum which also exhibits works excavated from the Misis Tumulus.

[[Adana Ethnography Museum]] opened inside a converted church in 1983. The courtyard contains the epitaphs and gravestones of Adana's leading figures of the 17th century. The interiors exhibits clothing, jewellery and weaponry of [[Yörük]] (nomadic) villagers.

The [[Atatürk Museum (Adana)|Atatürk Museum]] focuses on the War of Independence and the first years of Republic in a mansion where [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]] stayed during his trips to Adana.

Other museums, several of them in restored historic buildings, include the Karacaoğlan Museum of Literature, the [[Adana Cinema Museum|Adana Museum of Cinema]], the Yeşiloba Martyrs' Museum, the Mehmet Baltacı Museum of Photography and the Adana Urban Museum.<ref>{{cite web |date=12 February 2012 |title=Müzelere öğrenci ilgisi (Turkish) |url=http://www.haberler.com/muzelere-ogrenci-ilgisi-3353777-haberi/ |access-date=12 February 2012 |publisher=Haberler.com}}</ref>

The '''State Fine Arts Gallery''' opened in the [[Sabancı Cultural Center|Sabancı Cultural Centre]] in 1982. Other public art galleries include the 75.Yıl Art Gallery in Atatürk Park, the Adana City Hall Art Gallery and the Art Gallery in the Seyhan Cultural Centre.

=== Bridges ===
Of the bridges crossing the Seyhan river within the city, the most notable is the [[Taşköprü (Adana)|Taşköprü]], a 2nd-century [[Roman bridge]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.adanakultur.gov.tr/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFB0ED0AA5232E402F59FCBAD67E463149| title = Adana Taşköprü (Stone Bridge)| publisher=Governorship of Adana Tourism and Culture Department}}</ref> Currently used by pedestrians and cyclists, it was, until 2007, the oldest bridge in the world to be open to motorised vehicles. [[Demirköprü (bridge)|Demirköprü]] is a railway bridge that was built in 1912 as part of the [[Berlin-Baghdad Railway]] project. Regülatör bridge, at the southern section of the city, is a road bridge as well as a regulator for the river water. There are also three footbridges, Seyhan and Mustafakemalpaşa road bridges, the bridge of the [[Adana Metro|metro]] and the bridge of the [[List of highways in Turkey#O-50 – O-59|motorway]] spanning the river.

=== Turkish Baths (Hamams) ===
'''The Çarşı Hamam''' (''[[Turkish bath]] of the Bazaar'') was built in 1529 by Ramazanoğlu Piri Pasha and is Adana's largest [[Turkish bath|hamam]]. It has five domes and the interior is faced with marble. At the time it was built, water used to be brought from the Seyhan River using a sequence of canals and water wheels.<ref>{{cite web |title=Çarşı Hamamı(Turkish) |url=http://www.kenthaber.com/akdeniz/adana/seyhan/Rehber/hamamlar/carsi-hamami--- |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004173530/http://www.kenthaber.com/akdeniz/adana/seyhan/Rehber/hamamlar/carsi-hamami--- |archive-date=4 October 2009 |publisher=Kenthaber Kültür Kurulu |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

'''The Irmak Hamam''' (''Turkish bath of the River''), next to the Seyhan District Hall, was built in 1494 by Ramazanoğlu Halil Bey over the ruins of an ancient [[Roman bath]]. Its water comes from the river. Other historical [[Turkish bath|hamam]]s in the city are Mestenzade Bath and Yeni Bath.[[File:Adana_Ulu_Camii_8652.jpg|thumb|Courtyard of [[Ulu Cami, Adana|Ulu Cami]], Adana's most important historic mosque]]

=== Churches ===
[[File:Kuruköprü Church, front view.JPG|thumb|left|Kuruköprü Church]]
[[File:Adana_Saint_Paul_Church_3040.jpg|thumb|Saint Paul Church (Bebekli Kilise)]]

Nineteenth century Adana had four churches, two Armenian, one Greek Orthodox and one Roman Catholic. The Roman Catholic [[Saint Paul Church, Adana|Saint Paul Church (Bebekli Kilise)]] was built in 1870 and is in the old town, close to 5 Ocak Square. It currently serves the Roman Catholic and Protestant communities.<ref>"[http://www.anadolukatolikkilisesi.org/adana/tr/]." Adana Catholic Church. Retrieved on 28 September 2015.</ref>

The Agios Nikolaos (St Nicholas) Greek Orthodox Church was built in 1845 in the Kuruköprü area but was converted into a museum in 1950. It was reconsecrated as a church in 2015 and renamed the [[Kuruköprü Monumental Church]].

The Armenian Church on Ali Münif Street, midway between [[Yağ Camii|the Yağ Camii]] and the [[Büyüksaat|Büyük Saat]], was converted into a branch of the [[Ziraat Bankası|Ziraat Bank]] during the Republican Era. Surp Asdvadzadzin Armenian Apostolic Church on Abidinpaşa Street, which was in service until 1915, was used as a cinema until 1970 then demolished by the government. The Central Bank (Merkez Bankası) regional headquarters was built in its place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cezmiyurtsever.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=191&Itemid=28|title=Kiikya Ermenileri|first=Cezmi|last=Yurtsever|publisher=Cezmiyurtsever.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708133100/http://cezmiyurtsever.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=191&Itemid=28|archive-date=8 July 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Parks and gardens ===
Adana has many parks and gardens.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://adana-bld.gov.tr/adanabld.asp?siteID=2&DilID=1&KatID=4&sayfaID=25 | title = Rekreasyon Çalışmaları | publisher = Adana Metropolitan Municipality | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140822193026/http://adana-bld.gov.tr/adanabld.asp?siteID=2&DilID=1&KatID=4&sayfaID=25 | archive-date = 22 August 2014 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Owing to the warm climate, they are open all year round without the need for winter maintenance.

Paths along both banks of the Seyhan river track the city from the south end to the Seyhan Reservoir. The path then joins up with the wide sidewalks  of Adnan Menderes Boulevard which follows the southern shores of the Seyhan Reservoir, thereby extending the path to the west end of the reservoir. The most scenic stretch is '''Dilberler Sekisi''' on the west bank between the old and new dams. A path along the north side of the Grand Canal goes from the east end to the west end of the city, crossing the Seyhan river. Once completed, the network of paths within the city will cover almost {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=off}}, connecting several parks.

[[File:Merkez Park Clock Tower.JPG|thumb|left|Clock Tower at Merkez Park]]
The [[Merkez Park]] (Central Park) is a 33-hectare [[urban park]] on both banks of the Seyhan river, just north of the Sabancı Merkez Mosque. With a 2100-seater amphitheatre, a Chinese Garden, a Rowing Club and two cafes, it is the city's main recreational area.

'''The Süleyman Demirel Arboretum''' is a large botanical garden containing collections of woody plants intended partly for scientific study by Çukurova University researchers. The arboretum is also used for recreational purposes by city residents. 512 species of plants can be found in the arboretum.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ogm-adanaobm.gov.tr/default.asp?orman=arboretum | title = Çukurova Süleyman Demirel Arboretumu (Turkish) | publisher = Adana Orman Bölge Müdürlüğü }} {{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

'''Atatürk Park''' is a 4.7-hectare city park built during the first years of the Republic in the central commercial district of the city. The park holds a statue of [[Atatürk]] and hosts public ceremonies.

'''Çobandede Park''' is a 16.5-hectare park on a hill overlooking the Seyhan Reservoir. It contains the tomb of Çoban Dede, a wise man from Karslı Village.

'''The Yaşar Kemal Woods''' serves as a hiking area on the eastern bank of the Seyhan river opposite Dilberler Sekisi. It is dedicated to the Çukurova-born writer [[Yaşar Kemal]].

'''Çatalan Woods''' is a large recreational area between the Çatalan and Seyhan reservoirs in the Karaisalı district north of the city.

=== Other Attractions ===
The [[Büyüksaat|Büyük Saat (''Great Clock Tower'')]], built by the governor of Adana in 1882, is Turkey's tallest clock tower, rising {{convert|32|m|2|abbr=on}} high. It was damaged during the French occupation, but was rebuilt in 1935, and its image appears on the city's coat of arms. The '''Kazancılar Çarşısı''' (Cauldron-makers Bazaar) grew up around the Büyük Saat.

[[Ramazanoğlu Hall]] was built in 1495 during the reign of Halil Bey. A three-story building, made of stone and brick, it is one of the oldest houses to survive in Turkey. The existing hall was the Harem section of the property where the Ramadanid family lived. The Selamlık section, which contained the government offices, has been lost.

== Society and culture ==
One of the defining features of Adana is its agriculture-based life and the agriculture-based industrial culture associated with it. However, developments in industrial life, improvements in transportation, the effects of mass communication and large-scale migration have affected Adana's culture. As in other Turkish cities, the culture in different sections of the city is often very different from that in other areas.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://turkoloji.cu.edu.tr/CUKUROVA/makaleler/25.php | title = Adana Halk Kültürüne bakış |first=Erman|last=Artun|publisher=Çukurova Üniversitesi Türkoloji Araştırmaları Merkezi}}</ref>

[[File:Adana kebab.jpg|thumb|{{Lang|tr|Adana kebabı}}]]
Adana's cuisine is influenced mainly by Yörük (Nomad), Arabic and Armenian cookery. Spicy, sour and fatty dishes made of meat (usually [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]) and bulghur are common. In almost every home, bulghur and flour, red pepper, spices, tahini, a chopping block and a pastry board can be found. The bulghur used in cooking is made from a dark coloured hard wheat specific to Adana.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.adanadan.biz/icerik.asp?ICID=73 | title = Adana Mutfağı(Turkish)|publisher=adanadan.biz}}</ref>

The {{Lang|tr|[[Adana kebabı]]}}, simply called "kebap" locally, is made from minced meat and is the most popular dining choice in the city. Since it can be found in all kebab restaurants in Turkey and in most Turkish restaurants around the world, the Adana name is still associated with the kebab for many people.

[[File:yeni3.jpg|thumb|left|A glass of şalgam]]
Adana kebab is usually served with an onion salad, green salad or a well-chopped tomato salad. [[Rakı]] or [[Turnip water|şalgam]] (turnip juice) usually accompany it.

There are many salads typical to Adana. Radish salad with tahini is very popular and is found only in the Çukurova region. [[Şalgam]] and pickle juice are the preferred  drinks for winter with aşlama ([[licorice]] juice) replacing them in summer.

A sweet called [[Seker Sucugu]] (Sweet Sausage) originated in Adana where it was invented by Sir Duran O. during the First World War, around 1915.

Alongside tomato paste, pepper paste is used in almost every dish. The city is also famous for its ''Şırdan'' a kind of sausage stuffed with rice and eaten with [[cumin]]; for ''paça'', boiled sheep's feet; and for ''bicibici'' (pronounced as bee-jee-bee-jee) made from jellied starch, rose water and sugar and served with crushed ice especially in the summer. The city also offers a number of famous desserts, such as ''Halka Tatlı'', a round-shaped dessert, and ''Taş Kadayıf'', a bow-shaped dessert. Several types of fruit, including the [[apricot]], are native to this area.

'''The Adana Literature Festival''' is held every April at the Adana Centre for Arts & Culture. Around 100 writers, poets and critics participate in the festival.

===Nightlife===

During the mid-20th century, Adana was well known for its vibrant nightlife and many {{lang|tr|pavyons}} which mostly functioned as adult entertainment clubs, similar to the Japanese [[hostess club]]s, with live music and a lounge with tables lined up on the ground floor and private rooms upstairs.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sabah.com.tr/fotohaber/yasam/adana_artik_pavyonla_anilmiyor?tc=36&albumId=29729&page=22 | title = Adana artık pavyonla anılmıyor.(Turkish)|first=İbrahim|last=Altay|publisher=Sabah Gazetesi|access-date= 11 February 2012}}</ref> The first {{lang|tr|pavyons}} opened before 1942 with the arrival of Englishmen who worked on the Adana-[[Ulukışla]] road that was funded by the British Government in an effort to persuade Turkey to join World War II.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sabah.com.tr/fotohaber/yasam/adana_artik_pavyonla_anilmiyor?tc=36&albumId=29729&page=19 | title = Adana'da bar-pavyon hayatı| first=İbrahim| last=Altay|publisher=Sabah Gazetesi}}</ref> By the 1950s landowners who had grown wealthy from the cotton trade opened more and more ''pavyons'' along the Seyhan river. In the 1960s, rapid industrialisation brought more patrons from across the country, including from Istanbul and Ankara, and Adana was dubbed the Pavyon Capital of Turkey. Many popular singers owed their fame to the Adana {{lang|tr|pavyons}}.

The ''pavyons'' led the way for Western-style pubs and nightclubs by the late 1980s as Adana underwent big socio-economic changes. The traditional entertainment district was Sular, near the Central Station, but nowadays pubs and clubs are spread throughout the city. The bigger clubs are mostly along the river and around the lake. There are still two active {{lang|tr|pavyons}}, Afrodit and Maksim, but now most adult entertainment is directed at what is known locally as tele-bars which are licensed as regular pubs but function as places where bargirls entertain customers. There are around twenty tele-bars mainly in the city centre and around the old dam.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sabah.com.tr/fotohaber/yasam/adana_artik_pavyonla_anilmiyor?tc=36&albumId=29729&page=12 | title = Tele-bar Furyası (Turkish)|first=İbrahim|last=Altay|publisher=Sabah Gazetesi}}</ref>

A hundred-year-long tradition of dining on [[Adana Kebab|kebab]], liver and [[rakı]] in the Kazancılar Bazaar, with street music and dancing, turned into a festival with all-night entertainment in 2010. The [[World Rakı Festival]], officially renamed the Adana Kebab and Şalgam Festival, is held on the second Saturday night of December and attracts more than 20,000 people to the old town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnnturk.com/haber/turkiye/rakicilar-bir-kez-daha-dunya-raki-gunune-hazirlaniyor |title=Rakıcılar bir kez daha Dünya Rakı Gününde buluşuyor |website=Cnnturk.com |date=2014-11-27 |access-date=2016-01-19}}</ref>

Athletic sport life had progressed in Cilicia with the coaches that were invited to Adana from Istanbul in the early 20th century. Varag Pogharian and Mateos Zarifian played an important role in organising the athletic movement and the first sports clubs in the city were founded by the Armenian community. In 1913, Adana Türkgücü was founded by Ahmet Remzi Bey and İsmail Sefa Bey in alliance with the Istanbul Türkgücü club that had been initiated by the [[Committee of Union and Progress]].<ref name="ArmenianSports">Tekin İdem (2015) ''Journal of History Schools, Volume 8, Part 22, Ahmet Remzi Yüreğir'in Hayatı ve 8.Yasama Dönemi Meclis Faaliyetleri'', Batman Üniversitesi, Batman, Türkiye [https://www.batman.edu.tr/Files/Scientific/da2fc49e-e5fc-4382-b79f-3293f725ed70.pdf page 325] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215143156/http://www.batman.edu.tr/Files/Scientific/da2fc49e-e5fc-4382-b79f-3293f725ed70.pdf |date=15 December 2017 }}</ref> Adana's athletic clubs joined the '''Cilician Olympic Games''' held in April 1914 at a venue north of [[Dörtyol]], a first of its kind for the region.<ref name="ArmenianSports2">Hayk Demoyan (editor) (2014) ''International Journal of Armenian Genocide Studies, Volume 1, Part 1, Patriotism, Competitive Nationalism and Minority's Success: Armenian Sports in the Ottoman Empire pre-1915 period'', Tigran Mets Publishing House, Yerevan, Armenia, [https://issuu.com/agmi.am/docs/journal-of-armenian-genocide-englis page 21]</ref> In the 1920s, Adana İdman Yurdu, Adana Türk Ocağı, Seyhanspor and Milli Mensucat clubs were all founded and joined the [[Çukurova Football League|Adana Football League]] that was established in 1924 along with clubs from other Cilician provinces.

The oldest newspaper, ''Yeni Adana (''New Adana)'','' dates back to 1918<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yeniadana.net/web/hakkimizda.aspx?pgid%3D11 |title=:: Yeni Adana'yÄ± TanÄ±yalÄ±m :: |access-date=30 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523010238/http://www.yeniadana.net/WEB/hakkimizda.aspx?pgid=11 |archive-date=23 May 2009}}</ref> and played a significant role in the independence movement after the First World War. Most Adana newspapers serve not only the city but the whole Çukurova region. Many national newspapers have regional publishing centres in Adana. [[Hürriyet]] publishes a supplement, ''Hürriyet Çukurova'', which is Turkey's most popular regional newspaper with a circulation of 48,000. [[Sabah (newspaper)|Sabah]]'s regional supplement, ''Güney (South),'' is also published in Adana.

Kanal A is Adana's longest serving TV broadcaster, Çukurova TV, Akdeniz TV, Koza TV and Kent TV are the other major broadcasters. There are numerous local radio channels and [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation|TRT]]'s Çukurova Radio can be listened to in the city.

===Shopping===

Çakmak Street is the traditional shopping street in the old town. Attempts to pedestrianise it have been unsuccessful because traffic flow can't be diverted. There are several historical bazaars around the Büyük Saat (Clocktower) and Yağ Camii (Oil Mosque). The covered markets around Saydam street, and the Kilis and Mısır bazaars used to be centres for shopping for quality foreign goods.

Ziyapaşa Boulevard is an elegant street where expensive brand-name shops are located. It runs from the D-400 state road to the Central Train Station with the shops are concentrated towards the north end. The streets around Ziyapaşa and the Özal, Demirel and Evren boulevards in northern Adana also feature high-end shops.

Adana has four modern shopping malls. Galleria was the first to be built in the early 1990s. The M1 and Carrefour malls were built during the late 1990s at the west end of the city. Recently opened Optimum Outlet is the first mall east of the river and the closest to the city centre. It has a view of the river and the Merkez (Central) Park.

The [[Adana Gundogdu Schools]] is the largest private school in Adana and expands every year. There are six public and six private schools for pupils with special needs. Nine Community Training Centres help adult residents improve their skills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adana.meb.gov.tr/istatistik/ilce_kurum_sayilari.asp |title=Schools in Adana |publisher=Adana Governorship Education Department |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004183414/http://adana.meb.gov.tr/istatistik/ilce_kurum_sayilari.asp |archive-date=4 October 2009 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Although the city has large Kurdish and Arab communities education in "unofficial" languages is only provided at institutions that do not get government support. Few of them teach Arabic or Kurdish.

The requirement to pass an entrance exam for admission to high schools and universities and for a career in the civil service led to the opening of more than one hundred [[cram schools|crammer schools]] ({{langx|tr|dershane}}) in the city.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dershaneler Dosyası (Turkish) |url=http://www.atonet.org.tr/yeni/index.php?p=235&l=1 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072939/http://www.atonet.org.tr/yeni/index.php?p=235&l=1 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |publisher=Ankara Chamber of Commerce |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Transportation==
[[File:Adana road map.png|thumb|Map of the road network of Adana]]

In the 16th century, Adana was a port city where ships could navigate along the [[Seyhan River]] to the port just south of [[Stone Bridge (Adana)|Taşköprü]]. It is now on the main route connecting Europe to the Middle East.

===Intercity transport===
[[File:Demirköprü railway bridge in Adana.png|thumb|left|[[Demirköprü (bridge)|Demirköprü]]]]
[[File:Adana Garı(Gece).jpg|thumb|[[Adana Railway Station]]]]

Adana’s closest airport is [[Çukurova International Airport]], located 34km (21mi) from the city centre. It is the sixth busiest airport in Turkey. There are international flights to major cities of Germany, to [[Beirut]], [[Jeddah]], [[London]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Brussels]], [[Moscow]] and [[Nicosia]] ([[TRNC]]), and frequent domestic flights to [[Istanbul]], [[Ankara]], [[İzmir]], [[Antalya]], [[Trabzon]], [[Bodrum]] and [[Van, Turkey|Van]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dunyagazetesi.com.tr/pegasus-adana-merkezli-diyarbakir-ve-van-ucuslarina-basladi_104937_haber.html |title=Pegasus, Adana merkezli Diyarbakır ve Van uçuşlarına başladı(Turkish) |publisher=Dünya Gazetesi |access-date=3 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108113436/http://www.dunyagazetesi.com.tr/pegasus-adana-merkezli-diyarbakir-ve-van-ucuslarina-basladi_104937_haber.html |archive-date=8 November 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

[[Turkish State Railways|Turkish State Railways (TCDD)]] runs five long-distance lines connecting Adana to Ankara, [[Kayseri]], [[Karaman]], [[Konya]] and [[Elazığ]]. All these lines use the [[Adana Central railway station|Central Railway Station]] while some also use the city's other railway stations—[[Şehitlik railway station|Şehitlik]] and [[Şakirpaşa Railway Station|Şakirpaşa]] stations to the west, [[Kiremithane railway station|Kiremithane]], [[İncirlik Railway Station|İncirlik]] and [[Yakapınar railway station|Yakapınar]] stations o the east. TCDD also runs three regional lines across Çukurova. The [[Adana–Mersin Main Line|Adana-Mersin Line]] operates as a commuter train with 27 trains daily.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haberler.com/adana-mersin-hizli-tren-seferleri-basliyor-haberi/|title=Adana -Mersin Hızlı Tren Seferleri Başlıyor (Turkish)|publisher=Anadolu Ajansı|access-date=19 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123110119/http://www.haberler.com/adana-mersin-hizli-tren-seferleri-basliyor-haberi|archive-date=23 November 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Services to [[Osmaniye]]&ndash;[[Islahiye]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcdd.gov.tr/Upload/Files/ContentFiles/2010/bolgesel/islahiyeadana.htm|title=Islahiye-Adana Regional Train|publisher=Todd.gov.tr|access-date=2 October 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921042331/http://www.tcdd.gov.tr/Upload/Files/ContentFiles/2010/bolgesel/islahiyeadana.htm|archive-date=21 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and to [[Iskenderun|İskenderun]] run once a day. Regional trains stop at all city stations.

Although they became less popular as private airlines introduced inexpensive flights, buses are still the main form of transport to and from the city. Adana has two intercity bus terminals offering services to almost all Turkey's towns and cities. Bus companies travelling to cities west of Adana depart from the '''Central Bus Terminal''' while buses travelling to cities east of Adana depart from '''Yüreğir Bus Terminal'''. A shuttle service runs between the two terminals. Regional bus and minibus services from Adana to other places in Çukurova are plentiful. Extra summer bus services operate to the high plains of Tekir, Bürücek and Kızıldağ to enable Adana residents to escape the city heat.

There is an extensive [[List of highways in Turkey#Motorways|motorway network (O50-O59)]] connecting Adana to as far as [[Erdemli]] in the west, [[Niğde]] in the north, [[Şanlıurfa]] in the east and [[Iskenderun]] in the south. It can take as little as 40 minutes to get to Mersin and two hours to reach [[Gaziantep]].

===Local transport===
[[File:Metro map Adana.png|thumb|left|Map of the Adana Metro]]

Local transport is provided by the '''Adana Transit Corporation''' (a division of the Metropolitan Municipality) and by [[dolmuş]] and bus co-operatives. The Transit Corporation runs the Metro and the municipal buses.

[[Adana Metro]] is a [[Rapid Transit|rapid transit]] system that extends {{convert|14|km|0|abbr=off}} from the north-west to the city centre and Yüreğir.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.haberler.com/adana-hafif-rayli-tasima-sistemi-devreye-girdi-haberi/ | title = Adana Hafif Raylı Taşıma Sistemi Devreye Girdi. (Turkish)| date = 14 May 2010|publisher=Anadolu Ajansı| access-date=14 May 2010}}</ref> The Metro M1 line has thirteen stations and can transport 21,600 passengers an hour in each direction, a complete journey taking twenty minutes. A planned second line will run from Akıncılar to Çukurova University in the Sarıçam District. It will be {{convert|9.5|km|0|abbr=off}} long and will have seven stations..The Metro will eventually cover {{convert|23.5|km|1|abbr=off}} and serve 20 stations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=adana metrosu 2. etap - Google Search |url=https://www.google.com/search?q=adana+metrosu+2.+etap#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:bb622681,vid:oe5HREFLSbc |access-date=2022-12-07 |website=www.google.com}}</ref>

The Adana Transit Corporation also operates 229 bus services, eight of them designed specifically for disabled users. Payment is collected via a Kentkart smartcard system. Six Bus Co-operatives (known as Can buses) operate another 411 buses also using the Kentkart. Eighteen [[dolmuş]] co-operatives, with a total of 1,086 minibuses, provide services even to minor streets.

===Cycling and walking===
Adana is mostly flat and the warm weather makes it convenient for year-round cycling and walking. Cycling from one end of the city to the other usually takes less than 40 minutes. Although there are no bike lanes there are two bike paths, one along Fuzuli Street, the other along M. Kemalpaşa Boulevard. When compared to cities like İzmir, [[Konya]] and [[Eskişehir]], Adana is less bicycle friendly.

Car-oriented urban planning has become even more extreme since the 1980s, with pedestrians finding parts of the sidewalks of popular streets converted into car parks. Adana has almost no car-free streets or squares. There are plans to convert both ends of Taşköprü (the Stone bridge) into squares and to widen the overcrowded sidewalks in the old town where it is difficult to walk. By far the most [[Walkability|pedestrian-friendly]] street is Turgut Özal Boulevard although Kenan Evren and other major streets in the Çukurova district are also convenient for walking.
