'''Medellín''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|ɛ|d|ə|ˈ|l|iː|n|}} {{respell|MED|ə|LEEN}} {{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|ɛ|d|eɪ|ˈ|(|j|)|iː|n}} {{respell|MED|ay|(Y)EEN}}; {{IPA|es|meðeˈʝin|lang}} or {{IPA|es|meðeˈʎin|}}), officially the '''Special District of Science, Technology and Innovation of Medellín''' ({{langx|es|Distrito Especial de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación de Medellín}}), is the [[List of cities in Colombia|second-largest city]] in [[Colombia]] after [[Bogotá]], and the capital of the department of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]]. It is located in the [[Aburrá Valley]], a central region of the [[Andes Mountains]], in northwestern South America. The city's population was 2,508,452 at the [[2018 Colombian census|2018 census]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The [[Metropolitan Area of Medellín|metro area of Medellín]] is the second-largest urban agglomeration in Colombia in terms of population and economy, with more than 4 million people.

In 1616, the Spaniard Francisco de Herrera Campuzano erected a small indigenous village (''poblado'') known as "[[Lawrence of Rome|Saint Lawrence]] of Aburrá" (''San Lorenzo de Aburrá''), located in the present-day [[El Poblado (Medellín)|El Poblado]] commune. On 2 November 1675, the [[queen consort]] [[Mariana of Austria]] founded the "Town of [[Virgin of Candelaria|Our Lady of Candelaria]] of Medellín" (''Villa de Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria de Medellín'') in the Aná region, which today corresponds to the center of the city (east-central zone) and first describes the region as "Medellín". In 1826, the city was named the capital of the [[Department of Antioquia]] by the National Congress of the nascent [[Republic of Gran Colombia]], comprising present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama. After Colombia won its independence from Spain, Medellín became the capital of the Federal State of Antioquia until 1888, with the proclamation of the [[Colombian Constitution of 1886]]. During the 19th century, Medellín was a dynamic commercial center, first exporting gold, then producing and exporting coffee.

Towards the end of the 20th century and into the beginning of the 21st, the city regained industrial dynamism, with the construction of the [[Medellín Metro]] commuter rail, liberalized development policies and improvement in security and education. Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have lauded the city as a pioneer of a post-[[Washington Consensus]] "[[Developmental state#Local Developmental State|local development state]]" model of economic development.<ref name=ODI1>Milford Bateman, Juan Pablo Duran Ortíz and Kate Maclean 2010.

==Toponymy==
The valley and its Spanish settlement have gone by several names over the years, including ''Aburrá de los Yamesíes'', "Valley of Saint Bartholomew", "Saint Lawrence of Aburrá", "Saint Lawrence of Aná", ''Villa de la Candelaria de Medellín'', and finally "Medellín".<ref name="Woods2012">{{cite book|author=Woods|title=Bradt Colombia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-xoZwlNgYGAC&pg=PA315|date=20 January 2012|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-364-1|page=315|access-date=27 February 2016|archive-date=23 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323133616/https://books.google.com/books?id=-xoZwlNgYGAC&pg=PA315|url-status=live}}</ref>

The name "Medellín" comes from [[Medellín (Spain)|Medellín, Spain]], a small village in the [[Badajoz]] province of [[Extremadura]]. The village is known for being the birthplace of [[Hernán Cortés]]. The Spanish Medellín, in turn, was originally called "Metellinum" and was named after the Roman General [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius]] in 75 BC who founded the village as a military base.<ref name="origin">{{cite web |url = http://www.medellin.es/psituacion.htm |title = Ayuntamiento de Medellín (España). Toponímicos de Medellín |language = es |access-date = 2008-05-04 |archive-date = 2008-06-09 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080609234020/http://www.medellin.es/psituacion.htm |url-status = live }}</ref>

Some of the [[Conquistadors]], such as [[Gaspar de Rodas]], the first governor of Antioquia, came from the region of [[Badajoz (province)|Badajoz]]. Count Pedro Portocarrero y Luna, President of the Council for the West Indies (''Consejo de Indias''), asked the [[Monarchy|Spanish monarchy]] to give the name of his town, Medellín in Extremadura, to the new settlement in America. His request was accepted on November 22, 1674, when the [[Regent]] Mariana of Austria proclaimed the city's name to be ''Villa de Nuestra Señora de Medellín''. Miguel Aguinaga y Mendiogoitia, Governor, made the name official on November 2, 1675. The Crown granted a coat of arms to the city on June 24, 1676.<ref name="origin"/>

==History==

===Pre-Columbian<!--This is NOT a typo. Before Christopher Columbus, not before Colombia --> era and settlers===
[[File:Retrato de Jorge Robledo.jpg|thumb|upright|Spanish conquistador [[Jorge Robledo (conquistador)|Marshal Jorge Robledo]]]]

In August 1541, [[Jorge Robledo (conquistador)|Marshal Jorge Robledo]] was in the place known today as [[Heliconia, Antioquia|Heliconia]] when he saw in the distance what he thought was a valley. He sent Jerónimo Luis Tejelo to explore the territory, and during the night of August 23, Tejelo reached the plain of what is now Aburrá Valley. The Spaniards gave it the name of "Valley of [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Saint Bartholomew]]", but this was soon changed for the native name ''Aburrá'', meaning "Painters", due to the textile decorations of the local chief-men.<ref name="restrepo">Restrepo Uribe, Jorge (1981), Medellín, su Origen, Progreso y Desarrollo, Servigráficas, Medellín. {{ISBN|84-300-3286-X}}.</ref>

In 1574, Gaspar de Rodas asked the [[Department of Antioquia|Antioquia's]] [[Cabildo (council)|Cabildo]] for {{convert|4|mi2|km2|order=flip|0|sp=us}} of land to establish herds and a ranch in the valley. The Cabildo granted him {{convert|3|mi2|km2|order=flip|0|sp=us}} of land.<ref name="restrepo"/>

In 1616, the colonial visitor Francisco de Herrera y Campuzano founded a settlement with 80 Amerindians, naming it ''Poblado de San Lorenzo'', today "[[El Poblado, Medellín|El Poblado]]". In 1646 a colonial law ordered the separation of Amerindians from [[mestizo]]s and [[mulatto]]s, so the colonial administration began the construction of a new town in Aná, today [[Berrío Park]], where the church of ''Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria de Aná'' ("Our Lady of Candelaria of Aná") was built. Three years later, the Spaniards started the construction of the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Candelaria]], which was rebuilt at the end of the 18th century.<ref name="restrepo"/>

===Growth of the town===
[[File:Catedral de Medellín-Fachada P.jpg|left|thumbnail|[[Metropolitan Cathedral of Medellín]]]]

After 1574, with Gaspar de Rodas settled in the valley, the population started to grow. According to the church records of the San Lorenzo Church, six couples married between 1646 and 1650, and 41 between 1671 and 1675.<ref name="restrepo"/> Gold mines were developed northeast of Antioquia, thus they needed food supply from nearby agriculture. The Aburrá Valley was in a strategic position between the gold mines and the first provincial capital of Antioquia, [[Santa Fe de Antioquia]].<ref name="restrepo"/>

The provincial capital, Santa Fe, started to lose importance and gradually became poor, as trade and prominent personalities of the region came to the Aburrá Valley, where rich families started to buy land. Soon, the first settlers asked for the creation of a [[Cabildo (council)]] in the valley, thus getting a separate government from Santa Fe.<ref name="restrepo"/> The Santa Fe government fought this, but Mariana of Austria signed the edict creating the Cabildo on November 22, 1674. The governor Miguel de Aguinaga proclaimed the royal edict on 2 November 1675. The new city was given the title of ''Villa de Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria''.<ref name="restrepo"/>

===During the Spanish colonial period===
[[File:Plano de Medellin 1791.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Map of Medellín in 1791]]

Before the creation of the town, the inhabitants were scattered throughout the valley, with only a few families concentrated at the confluence of the Aná (today called the [[Santa Elena River|Santa Elena]]) and the [[Medellín River|Medellín]] rivers; others lived in El Poblado San Lorenzo. After the royal edict, the settlers chose the Aná site as the heart of the future city, with the Candelaria Church at its center. {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

[[File:2018 Medellín iglesia de San Ignacio.jpg|thumb|upright|San Ignacio Church, an example of colonial architecture in Colombia]]
Their first buildings were simple, with [[Thatching|thatched]] roofs. The houses of the most important people were two stories tall, and the church and the Cabildo were unimpressive. It was only during the 18th century that the church was improved. Only one story, the Cabildo was located at the western part of the plaza. It had a thatched roof until 1742 when tiles were put on. In 1682, traders and foreigners started the construction of the [[Veracruz Hermitage]], which was consecrated as a church by the Bishop of [[Popayán]] in 1712.<ref name="restrepo"/>

In 1675, the first census during colonial times was taken: there were 3,000 people and 280 families. Another census was not taken until the colonial Visitador (royal inspector) [[Antonio Mon y Velarde]] [[:es:Juan Antonio Mon y Velarde|es]] ordered one between 1786 and 1787: there were then 14,507 people and 241 families. In 1808, two years before Colombia won independence, the city had 15,347 people and 360 families.<ref name="restrepo"/>

In 1803, the Royal College of the Franciscans was founded in the Central Plaza, which is [[Berrío Park]] today, with the initial departments of Grammar, Philosophy, and Theology.<ref>'"Suramericana de Seguros", in ''History of Antioquia,'' Ed. Presencia Ltda, Medellín, 1988, without ISBN, in Spanish.</ref> Soon after, the college moved to a new building in the small San Ignacio square. In 1821 it was renamed Colegio de Antioquia, and it became the [[University of Antioquia]] in 1901. The university also had the first vocational training school, the first cultural radio station in Latin America, and the first regional [[botanical garden]].

===Industrial revolution===
In the first half of the twentieth century, the population of Medellín increased sixfold, from 59,815 inhabitants in 1905 to 358,189 in 1951. The [[Thousand Days War]] (1899–1902) stopped the industrial development of the city, although the civil war did not affect the region directly. Under reforms by President [[Rafael Reyes]] after the conflict, the city continued its industrial development<ref name="restrepo"/> and founded a [[Chamber of commerce]]. The Chamber developed a regional transport project that connected Medellín to other Colombian regions and other nations.

Despite the importance of gold production in the early development of Medellín, the export of coffee contributed the most impetus in the 20th century for the city's growth. Trade grew to international dimensions as the main export of Colombia became [[Coffee production in Colombia|coffee]]. The industrial and commercial dynamism of Medellín also created a caste of traders and entrepreneurs, who founded the first nationwide industries in Colombia.<ref name="restrepo"/>

===Trade in Medellín===

[[Coltejer]] is one of the most important textile companies in Colombia. It was founded in Medellín by Alejandro Echavarría on October 22, 1907.<ref>Compañía Colombiana de Tejidos (''Colombian Textile Company'') Coltejer: [http://www.coltejer.com.co/empresa.htm History of the Company] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612045409/http://www.coltejer.com.co/empresa.htm |date=2007-06-12 }}, [[Itagüí]], Colombia, Retrieved on May 7, 2008.</ref> Its headquarters, the [[Coltejer Building]], is the tallest skyscraper in Medellín and the fourth tallest building in Colombia.

The discovery of coal in [[Amagá]], a few kilometers south of the Aburrá Valley, and the building of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric plants]] provided the new industries with energy, and this allowed the creation of many smaller companies. The Antioquia Railway (built in 1875) conquered the difficult geography of one of the most mountainous regions of South America, notably with the [[La Quiebra Tunnel]], which connected the industrial center to the [[Magdalena River]], the most major navigable river in Colombia. In 1932 Medellín also built its first airport, the [[Enrique Olaya Herrera Airport]].<ref name="restrepo" />

The study by Charles H. Savage on industrial production in Antioquia between 1960 and 1972 showed how important Medellín industries became to Colombia and South America. He studied social change produced by the introduction of new technology. Savage looked at three factories in Antioquia: two potteries in [[El Santuario|Santuario]] and [[La Blanca (Colombia)|La Blanca]], and a tailoring factory in Medellín. Savage studied the production of the Antioquian factories, and the relationship between the workers and their employers, an industrial efficiency which he called the "Culture of Work".<ref>Savage presented his thesis ''Factories in the Andes: Social Organization in a Developing Economy'' for his PhD in Business Administration at [[Harvard University]] in 1962.</ref> His conclusions were published by his colleague [[George F. Lombardi]] as ''Sons of the Machine'' (1988).<ref>{{citation|last1=Savage| first1=Charles H. Jr. |last2=Lombard|first2=George F.

===Art in the early 20th century===
Arts and literature have been an important social element in Medellín. The [[University of Antioquia]], the [[National University of Colombia]] with its Medellín branch, and the [[Pontifical Bolivarian University]] have historically been the academic centers of the city and are responsible for the formation of an intellectual class in the region.

During the first part of the 20th century, the city was part of the literary transition from [[romanticism]] to the modern art and literary movements of the new century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} The writer [[Tomás Carrasquilla]] (1858–1940) focused on the people of his native Antioquia, portraying their daily lives and customs. The writer and philosopher [[Fernando González (writer)|Fernando González]] from [[Envigado]] (in the metropolitan area of Medellín), the cartoonist [[Ricardo Rendón]], and the poet [[León de Greiff]] were some of the founders of ''Los Panidas'', a Medellín literary movement. Other featured poets and writers were [[Porfirio Barba-Jacob]] and [[Efe Gómez]]. In painting, the most famous were [[Eladio Vélez]] and [[Pedro Nel Gómez]]. [[Carlos Vieco Ortiz]] was a popular composer and musician. Medellín became the headquarters of record labels like Sonolux, Ondina, and Silver.<ref name="restrepo"/>

Medellín clubs, many of them dating to the end of the 19th century, became a center for intellectual and industrialist movements, like Club Union (founded in 1894) and Club Campestre (founded in 1924). In 1909, the Circo España was created, and Bolívar Theater in 1919. The ''art nouveau'' [[Edificio Gonzalo Mejía|Junín Theater]] was demolished to build the [[Coltejer Tower]], now the tallest building in the city. Cine Colombia, the first movie distributor of the country, was founded in Medellín in 1927.<ref name="restrepo"/>

===Growth in the second half of the 20th century===
[[File:Medellin Milla de Oro.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|[[El Poblado, Medellín|El Poblado]], a wealthy district located in the southern part of the city, is one of Colombia's most important urban and economic centers]]
Colombia entered a new era of political instability with the murder of presidential candidate [[Jorge Eliecer Gaitán]] in [[El Bogotazo|Bogotá]] in 1948. Political violence spread in the rural areas of Colombia, and farmers fled to the cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-weimar.de/architektur/raum/doktoranden/sanchez_Migracion_forzada_urbanizacion_en_Colombia.pdf|title=Migracion forzada y urbanizacion en Colombia|author=Lina María Sánchez Steiner|publisher=Seminario Internacional "Procesos Urbanos Informales"|date=October 31 – November 2, 2007|access-date=December 6, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000520/http://www.uni-weimar.de/architektur/raum/doktoranden/sanchez_Migracion_forzada_urbanizacion_en_Colombia.pdf|archive-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> The Valley slopes became overpopulated with slums.

As the population of Medellín grew quickly during the 1950s, industrialists, traders and local government created the "Medellín Master Plan" (MMP) (''Plan Piloto''), a plan for the expansion of the city into the Aburrá Valley that would lead to the creation of the first metropolitan area in Colombia. [[Paul Lester Wiener]] and [[José Luis Sert]] were the architects who led the project. Among the main features of the MMP were the canalization of the [[Medellín River]], the control of new settlements on valley slopes, the creation of an industrial zone in the Guayabal District, the planning of the city to be in harmony with the river, the construction of a city stadium, and an administrative center in [[La Alpujarra Administrative Center|La Alpujarra]].<ref name="restrepo"/> Little of the plan was actually done.

In 1951 the city had 358,189 inhabitants, but 22 years later, in 1973, the population had tripled to 1,071,252.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalurban.org/GUDMag07Vol3Iss1/Betancur.htm|title=Approaches to the Regularization of Informal Settlements: the case of primed in Medellín, Colombia|publisher=Global Urban Development Magazine (Volume 3, Issue 1)|author=John J.

The urban limits of the city grew to areas that were not contemplated in the MMP, so that Medellín now reached the urban areas of other cities of the Aburrá Valley, like [[Envigado]], [[Bello, Antioquia|Bello]] and [[Itagüí]]; the new Medellín settlers were poor families without enough credit to buy their own homes, so several neighborhoods were built beyond the MMP; several old downtown buildings were demolished to construct tall towers, offices, and avenues.

In 1968 the Second Conference of CELAM was held in Medellín expressing a [[preferential option for the poor]]. The traditional Junin Theatre along the Santa Elena was demolished to build the Coltejer Tower. The huge migration into Medellín provided workers for the expansion of textile factories, being modernized in this period,<ref name="restrepo"/> but it also created new problems for the city: higher unemployment, lack of services for poor areas, urban violence in several districts, and collapse of any hope of a transport system. {{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Today===
[[File:Medellin sightseeing.jpg|alt=|thumb|View of Medellín at night]]
The position of Medellín as an industrial city in Antioquia has been the main factor in overcoming its crisis of the 1980s and 1990s. The [[Medellín Metro]], a massive urban transport service, became the pride of the city. The construction of the [[Plaza Mayor, Medellín|Plaza Mayor of Medellín]], an international center for congresses and expositions, was designed to showcase the [[Globalization|globalized]] economy of Colombia to the world.

Social exclusion has eased due to the development of a transport infrastructure; a new system of public buses called "Metroplus" opened in December 2011, and gondolas called “MetroCable”, which help connect the poorest barrio communities in the hills to the city, have been in operation since 2004, with more routes being added in recent years.<ref name=ODI1/> Additionally, an electric escalator 1,260 feet long was inaugurated on December 26, 2011, in [[Comuna 13, Medellín|Comuna 13]], one of Medellín's poorest neighborhoods, making it one of the first of its kind in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-12-14 |title=How giant outdoor escalators transformed a Colombian neighborhood |url=https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/colombia-medellin-neighborhood/index.html |access-date=2024-03-08 |website=CNN |language=en}}</ref> Today's Medellín includes spaces for art, poetry, drama, the construction of public libraries, the foundation of new ecological parks, and the inclusion of people of the city in its development.<ref>{{ cite web | author = Nelson Alcantara | title = Colombia's Medellin: City Transformed | date = 23 February 2008 | website = decolombia.net | url = http://www.decolombia.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=46&Itemid=35 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430044447/http://decolombia.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=46&Itemid=35 |archive-date = 2008-04-30 }} </ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=The Medellin miracle |url=https://rapidtransition.org/stories/the-medellin-miracle/ |access-date=2024-03-08 |website=rapidtransition.org |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Freedman |first=David H. |date=2019-11-18 |title=How Medellín, Colombia, Became the World's Smartest City |url=https://www.newsweek.com/2019/11/22/medellin-colombia-worlds-smartest-city-1471521.html |access-date=2024-03-08 |website=Newsweek |language=en}}</ref>

==Geography==
Medellín has 16 ''[[Communes of Colombia|comunas]]'' (districts), 5 ''[[corregimiento]]s'' (townships), and 271 ''[[barrio]]s'' (neighborhoods).
The metropolitan area of Medellín lies within the Aburrá valley at an elevation of {{convert|1,500|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} [[above sea level]] and is bisected by the [[Medellín River]] (also called Porce), which flows northward. North of the valley are the towns of [[Bello, Antioquia|Bello]], [[Copacabana, Antioquia|Copacabana]], [[Girardota]], and [[Barbosa, Antioquia|Barbosa]]. To the south of the valley lie [[Itagüí]], [[Envigado]], [[Sabaneta, Antioquia|Sabaneta]], [[La Estrella, Colombia|La Estrella]], and [[Caldas, Antioquia|Caldas]].

===Climate===
The weather in Medellín is warm year-round with few temperature extremes. As a municipality, Medellín has an area of {{convert|382|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Medellín features a trade-wind [[tropical rainforest climate]] (''Af''), albeit a cooler version of this climate that borders closely on a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (''Am''), as well as having characteristics of a tropical highland climate (''Cfb''). Since Medellín is located at {{convert|1495|m|-2|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]], its climate is not as hot as other cities located at the same latitude near the equator. Because of its altitude above sea level and privileged location in the Andes Range, Medellín's weather at times is more characteristic of a [[humid subtropical climate]] than that of a [[tropical climate]]. The city's average annual temperature is {{convert|23|°C|0|abbr=on}}, and because of its proximity to the equator, its temperature is constant year-round, with minimal temperature variations. Temperatures range from {{convert|17|to|28|C|F|abbr=on}}. Because of the former pleasant springlike climate all year, Medellín was known as "La Ciudad de la Eterna Primavera" or "City of the Eternal Spring". The city is located in a valley and many of its districts are on slopes; temperatures can be slightly cooler on the surrounding mountains.

==Administrative divisions==
[[File:Comunas_de_Medellin.svg|thumb|[[Commune (Medellín)|Commune]]s of Medellín|alt=|left]]Medellín is a city governed by a [[republicanism|republican]] democratic system as stated in the [[Colombian Constitution of 1991]], with decentralized government. Administration is shared by the [[Mayor of Medellín]] and the Municipal Council, both elected by popular vote.

The municipality is made up of official departments (''secretarías'') including departments for social mobility, urban culture, social development, education, evaluation and control, government, resources, public works, administrative services, environment, women, and transportation. There are also many departments with a certain autonomy: the [[Olaya Herrera Airport]], the Public Library (''Biblioteca Pública Piloto''), the College of Antioquia (''Colegio Mayor''), the Urban Development Enterprise (EDU), the Public Service Enterprise (EPM), the Sport and Recreation Institute (INDER), the General Enterprises of Medellín (EEVVM), the Medellín Bus stations, the General Hospital of Medellín, the health service enterprise "Metrosalud", the Metropolitan Institute of Technology (ITM), the [[Metro de Medellín]], the department for the Administration of the Medellín parks (Metroparques) and Metroseguridad.

The municipality is divided into six zones: The urban zone, which is subdivided into 16 ''[[commune (Medellín)|comunas]]'' (communes). The communes are further divided into 249 statistical neighborhoods. The remaining zones outside the urban zones comprise five ''[[corregimiento]]s'' (townships).

Further, the municipality belongs to the [[Medellín Metropolitan Area]], which is made up of ten neighboring municipalities.

==Law and government==
The government of the city of Medellín is divided into executive and [[legislative]] branches. The [[List of mayors of Medellín|mayor]] of the city (Alcalde) is publicly elected for a term of four years (just like the president and the governor of any other department in Colombia).

===Local development state===
[[File:Gobernación de Antioquia2.jpg|thumbnail|La Alpujarra offices of the mayor of the city and the governor of the [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] department]]
Low tax rates mean Medellín's city administration's social and economic development policies have been funded by the city's ownership of the main energy supplier, Empresas Publicas de Medellín (EPM); 30% of its profits go directly to the city's administrative budget.<ref name=ODI1/> In addition to infrastructure projects, the city administration has developed a program of cash grants called 'the Medellín Solidaria' program that is very similar to [[Brazil]]'s highly successful [[Bolsa Familia]] and also the city runs the Cultura E program.<ref name=ODI1/>

According to the city administration, Medellín Solidaria represents an improvement on Colombia's national program, 'Familias en Accion' (Families in Action).<ref name=ODI1/> The city administration is further responsible for coordinating more than 100 other social programs.<ref name=ODI1/> Under the Cultura E program, the city administration has established a network of 14 publicly funded business support centers known as CEDEZO, Centros de Desarrollo Empresarial Zonal).<ref name=ODI1/> The CEDEZOs are found in the poorest areas of Medellín and support the poor in developing business by providing free-of-charge business support services and technical advice.<ref name=ODI1/>

Also, as part of Cultura E, there is Banco de las Opportunidades that provides [[microloans]] (up to $2,500 at a cheap interest rate of 0.91% monthly).<ref name=ODI1/> This has helped create more equal opportunities for all and overcome the barriers to entry to business for poor entrepreneurs with good ideas, but lacking capital, skills and connections.<ref name=ODI1/> It has also helped develop the local economy with new micro-enterprises.<ref name=ODI1/>

However, several mayoral candidates for the October 2011 elections have argued the Banco de las Opportunidades's interest rates are too high, loan maturity is too short and it should have [[grace period]]s.<ref name=ODI1/> They, therefore, suggest a new [[Small and Medium-sized Enterprise|small and medium-sized enterprise]] (SME) development bank to complement the Banco de las Opportunidades.

However, its homicide rate has decreased by 95% and extreme poverty by 66%, thanks in part to a string of innovative mayors who laid out plans to integrate the poorest and most violent hillside neighborhoods into the city center in the valley below. Medellín is now considered safer than the US cities of Baltimore, St. Louis, Detroit and New Orleans, which appear in the [[List of cities by murder rate|CCSPJP's top 50]] list.<ref name="seguridadjusticiaypaz">{{cite web|url= http://www.seguridadjusticiaypaz.org.mx/biblioteca/prensa/send/6-prensa/231-caracas-venezuela-the-most-violent-city-in-the-world|title= List of cities by murder rate|publisher= seguridadjusticiaypaz.org.mx|access-date= 26 January 2016|archive-date= 29 January 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160129184634/http://www.seguridadjusticiaypaz.org.mx/biblioteca/prensa/send/6-prensa/231-caracas-venezuela-the-most-violent-city-in-the-world|url-status= live}}</ref>

As the home of the [[Medellín Cartel]] funded by [[Pablo Escobar]], the city was a victim of the terror caused by the war between the organization headed by Escobar, and competing organizations such as "El Cartel del Valle". However, after the death of Escobar in December 1993, crime rates in the city have decreased dramatically.<ref name="Fuego cruzado en Medellín.">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_2337000/2337667.stm |title=Fuego cruzado en Medellín |date=October 17, 2002 |work=BBCMundo |access-date=May 3, 2009 |archive-date=November 27, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127142441/http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_2337000/2337667.stm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Throughout the rest of the 1990s crime rates remained relatively high, although gradually declining from the worst years. In October 2002, President [[Álvaro Uribe]] ordered the military to carry out "Operation Orion", the objective of which was to disband the urban militias of the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]] and the [[Self-Defense Units of Colombia|AUC]].<ref name="Fuego cruzado en Medellín."/> Between 2003 and 2006 the demobilization of the remaining urban militias of the AUC was completed, with more than 3,000 armed men giving up their weapons.<ref name="EspinalAgudelo2008">{{cite journal|last1=Espinal|first1=Manuel Alberto Alonso|author2=Germán Darío Valencia Agudelo|format=PDF|url=http://aprendeenlinea.udea.edu.co/revistas/index.php/estudiospoliticos/article/viewFile/1941/1600|title=Balance del proceso de Desmovilización, Desarme y Reinserción (DDR) de los bloques Cacique Nutibara y Héroes de Granada en la ciudad de Medellín|trans-title=Overview of the Process of Demobilization, Disarmament and Reintegration (DDR) in the Cacique Nutibara and Héroes de Granada Blocks in the City of Medellín|language=es|journal=Estudios Políticos|issue=33|date=July–December 2008|access-date=14 November 2016|issn=0121-5167|pages=11–34|doi=10.17533/udea.espo.1941 |s2cid=256917454 |archive-date=2 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202001726/http://aprendeenlinea.udea.edu.co/revistas/index.php/estudiospoliticos/article/viewFile/1941/1600|url-status=live|hdl=10495/3356|hdl-access=free}}</ref>

After the disbanding of the main paramilitary groups, some members briefly reorganized into criminal bands known commonly as [[Aguilas Negras]] ("Black Eagles"). These groups gained notoriety in Medellín for having called for curfews for the underage population, and having distributed fliers announcing the social cleansing of prostitutes, [[drug addicts]], and [[alcoholics]].<ref>Caracol Radio.

There is a significant disparity in crime rates by neighborhoods, with virtually no homicides in [[El Poblado]] and Conquistadores and higher crime rates in the south west, around the airport and the north of the city. Generally, crime rates increase the further the neighborhood is from the center.<ref name=llworldtour >{{cite web |url=http://www.llworldtour.com/2011/02/24/my-run-in-with-the-policia/ |title=Policia and Crime in Medellín, Colombia |date=2011-02-24 |access-date=2011-09-15 |archive-date=2011-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907091834/http://www.llworldtour.com/2011/02/24/my-run-in-with-the-policia/ |url-status=live }}</ref> From 2010 and 2011, homicides have declined as with crime in general, but there remains a high crime rate in the poorest communities.

==Economy==
[[File:Edificio Bancolombia - luces.jpg|thumb|right|Headquarters of [[Bancolombia]], the largest commercial bank in Colombia and one of the largest in Latin America, in Medellín]]
Medellín is Colombia's second most important economic center, after [[Bogotá]]. Its economy is led by a powerful group of people from the [[private sector]] known as the [[Grupo Empresarial Antioqueño]] (Antioquian Enterprises Group). The group was formerly known as the ''Sindicato Antioqueño'' (Antioquian Union) but after being mistaken abroad for a labor union, which hampered its international growth for many years, a new formal name was chosen. It is represented by David Bojanini, head of Grupo Suramericana (a banking, asset management and insurance conglomerate); Carlos Ignacio Gallego of [[Grupo Nutresa]] (food industry); José Alberto Velez of [[Argos (cement company)|Cementos Argos]] (a multinational cement company); and Carlos Raúl Yepes, head of [[Bancolombia]]. This group has an aggregate market capitalization of approximately US$17 billion and employs more than 80,000 Colombians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suleasing-intl.com/Colombia/ColGrupoSura.asp |title=Grupo Empresarial Antioqueño |trans-title=Business Group of Antioquia |language=es |publisher=suleasing-intl.com |access-date=15 October 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623194443/http://www.suleasing-intl.com/Colombia/ColGrupoSura.asp |archive-date=23 June 2006 |df=dmy }}</ref>

This group also participates in other sectors of the city industry and is an active trader in the Colombian stock exchange. Medellín serves as headquarters for many national and multinational companies.

Medellín's main economic products are steel, textiles, [[confection]]s, food and beverage, agriculture (from its rural area), [[public services]], chemical products, pharmaceuticals, refined oil, and flowers. Fashion is a major part of the economy and culture of the city. Medellín hosts Latin America's biggest fashion show, [[Colombiamoda]] [[:es:Colombiamoda|es]]

The [[Metropolitan Area of Medellín]] contributes about 70% of the total GDP of the Department of Antioquia and a bit more than 10% of the [[economy of Colombia]].<ref name="ProExport16"/> Antioquia is the second-greatest economic region of Colombia. By 2005, Antioquia's GDP was more than US$20,600,000,000 and the top exporting province in Colombia.<ref name="revista-semana-1329">Revista Semana (2007): "Ruta Empresarial", en Semana, vol.

The 2005 Report of the Economic Colombian Review of Proexport and the International Cooperation Agency of Medellín concluded that Medellín was at the same level of GDP contribution to the national economy as cities like [[Panama City]] in Panama, and [[San José de Costa Rica]].

===Medellín Cluster===
Medellín created the first Colombian [[business cluster]]. The city is the top exporting region of the country, with 1,750 export businesses based in Medellín.<ref name="revista-semana-1329"/> The Cluster was created with the support of the Chamber of Commerce of Medellín and the City Administration for an actual total of 21,000 companies that share 40% of total exports, 25% of the regional GDP, and 40% of Metro Area employment.<ref name="revista-semana-1329"/> The main economic activities of the Medellín Cluster (MC) are in [[electricity generation]], textile, fashion design, construction, tourism and business.<ref>Cámara de Comercio de Medellín.

[[Ruta N]] is a non-profit in Medellín which helps foreign companies set up office in Medellín.

===Unemployment and poverty===
According to data released by the Measuring Monetary Poverty and Inequality Mission (Spanish: ''Misión para el Empalme de las Series de Empleo, Pobreza y Desigualdad'', MESEP), in November 2009, the poverty rate in Medellín and its metropolitan area was reduced by 22.5%, from 49.7% to 38.5% during the period from 2002 to 2008. Similarly, the extreme poverty rate decreased by 25.2%, from 12.3% to 9.2%. These results are in line with the increased coverage of basic services such as health, education, and public services in the city. In 2014, the poverty rate decreased to 14.7% and extreme poverty to 2.8%.<ref name="dane.gov.co">{{cite web |url=http://www.dane.gov.co/files/investigaciones/condiciones_vida/pobreza/bol_pobreza_14_.pdf |title=Data |website=www.dane.gov.co |access-date=2015-10-25 |archive-date=2015-11-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151114213100/http://www.dane.gov.co/files/investigaciones/condiciones_vida/pobreza/bol_pobreza_14_.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

The unemployment rate in Medellín and its metropolitan area, as has been the case in Colombia as a whole, has decreased in the past decade. According to data from the National Statistics Department (Spanish: Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística, DANE) unemployment for Medellín and its Metropolitan Area was reduced by 25%, from 14.1%,<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.dane.gov.co/index.php/mercado-laboral/empleo-y-desempleo|title =DANE - Encuesta Continua de Hogares Total 13 ciudades y áreas metropolitanas Promedio 12 meses enero - diciembre (2001 - 2006)|access-date =February 1, 2016|url-status =dead|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160201162223/https://www.dane.gov.co/index.php/mercado-laboral/empleo-y-desempleo|archive-date =February 1, 2016}}</ref> just above the national average of 13.9% in 2005 to 10.6%,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.dane.gov.co/files/investigaciones/boletines/ech/ech/bol_empleo_dic_15.pdf|title = DANE - Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares (GEIH) Enero - Diciembre 2015|access-date = February 1, 2016|archive-date = January 29, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160129231159/http://www.dane.gov.co/files/investigaciones/boletines/ech/ech/bol_empleo_dic_15.pdf|url-status = live}}</ref> above the national average of 9.9%, in 2015.

==Urban development==
There are signs of heavy urban development within the city of Medellín, particularly with the construction of new skyscrapers. Medellín is outpacing all other major Colombian cities, including Bogotá, in the construction and proposed development of new high-rises. As of October 2016, there were 10 skyscrapers, 410 high-rises, 119 buildings under construction in Medellín, including 48 being planned.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emporis.com/city/101122/medellin-colombia|title=Medellín|publisher=[[Emporis]]|access-date=15 November 2016|archive-date=15 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115134131/https://www.emporis.com/city/101122/medellin-colombia|url-status=usurped}}</ref> Other projects that the city has planned are extensions of the city's metro system to nearby suburbs such as Sabaneta. Under construction, the new project is set to open to the public soon.

===Libraries and library parks===
{{Main|Library park (Colombia)}}
A "library park" ({{langx|es|parque biblioteca}}) is a term first used in Medellín for an urban complex formed by a combination of a library building with ample surrounding green space for public use. These library parks are strategically located in the periphery of the city to address the need for more cultural and education space and public services in less affluent neighborhoods.<ref name="Catalán2008">{{cite book|author=Manuela Agudo Catalán|title=El romanticismo en Aragón (1838-1854): literatura, prensa y sociedad|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wk2JqkAfwScC&pg=PA94|access-date=16 August 2013|year=2008|publisher=Universidad de Zaragoza|isbn=978-84-7733-137-7|pages=94–|archive-date=3 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203062451/https://books.google.com/books?id=Wk2JqkAfwScC&pg=PA94|url-status=live}}</ref> The development of library complexes and schools is part of an effort at cultural transformation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Melguizo|first=Jorge|title=La transformación de Medellín desde la Cultura|year=2008|publisher=Secretaría de Cultura de Medellín|location=Medellín}}</ref> This project also aims to create centralities inside the intervened areas that help consolidate and give a clearer identity to the communities. They are meant to provide a network of activity centers for the promotion of education, culture, sport, and recreation.

[[File:Biblioteca Leon de Greiff-Exterior4-Medellin.JPG|thumb|left|[[León de Greiff Library]]]]
The initial plan in 2009 built five libraries with attached parks to serve underprivileged neighborhoods. This development included the [[Biblioteca Parque España]] designed by [[Giancarlo Mazzanti]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americalate.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/col-parquebibliotecaespana-545px.jpg|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018101940/http://www.americalate.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/col-parquebibliotecaespana-545px.jpg|url-status=dead |title=Americalate, fotografía nocturna del Parque Biblioteca España|archive-date=October 18, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americalate.com/2009/09/24/medellin-una-ciudad-que-busca-reposicionarse/|title=americalate.com|access-date=29 November 2016|archive-date=9 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170409192313/http://www.americalate.com/2009/09/24/medellin-una-ciudad-que-busca-reposicionarse/|url-status=live}}</ref> and which was named after [[Spain]], who helped fund the construction of one of its buildings. Architects of the other libraries added as part of the program include [[Ricardo La Rotta Caballero]] and [[Hiroshi Naito]]. The four other libraries added were [[León de Greiff Library]] (also known as La Ladera Library Park), [[San Javier Library Park]], [[Bethlehem Library Park]], and [[La Quintana Library Park]].

After the initial 2009 program another five libraries were added to the plan for 2011. These libraries are the [[Doce de Octubre Library Park]] for Comunas 5 and 6, Noroccidente; [[Las Estancias Library Park]] for Comunas 8, 9, and Centroriental; [[Parque Biblioteca Guayabal]] for Comuna 15 and Suroccidente; Parque Biblioteca San Cristóbal] for Corregimiento and Occidente; and Parque Biblioteca San Antonio de Prado for Corregimiento and Sur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pbfernandobotero.blogspot.com/p/conoce-el-parque-biblioteca.html |title=Conoce el Parque Biblioteca |publisher=Sistemas de Bibliotecas Públicas de Medellín |access-date=2016-02-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130307193109/http://pbfernandobotero.blogspot.com/p/conoce-el-parque-biblioteca.html |archive-date=2013-03-07 }}</ref>

The idea of "library parks" has served as a model for library spaces in other countries, most notably the [[Manguinhos Library Park]] in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The Medellín Metropolitan Area Library Network is a set of libraries linked together to share resources, efforts, knowledge and experience to improve the educational and cultural conditions of the community. The network consists of over 100 libraries, 29 of which reside in Medellín.<ref>{{cite web|title=Libraries|url=http://www.reddebibliotecas.org.co/bibliotecas|website=Library Network|publisher=Red de Bibliotecas|access-date=13 September 2015|archive-date=5 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005170125/http://www.reddebibliotecas.org.co/bibliotecas|url-status=live}}</ref> The Library Network includes all of Medellín's library parks, as well as other regional libraries, such as the Public Pilot Library and the EPM Library.

The Library Network was a program created as a metropolitan agreement in 2005 thanks to an alliance of [[Empresas Públicas de Medellín]], its EPM Foundation, the Mayor of Medellín, and the Pilot Public Library. In 2009, the Library Network was awarded the "Access to Learning Award" by the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]], consisting of one million dollars to the EPM Foundation and the Library Network.<ref>{{cite web|title=Colombian Organization Receives ATLA - Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2009/08/Colombian-Organization-Receives-ATLA|publisher=Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation|access-date=13 September 2015|date=August 2009|archive-date=6 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906182129/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2009/08/Colombian-Organization-Receives-ATLA|url-status=live}}</ref>

Medellín in 2013 won the [[Veronica Rudge Green Prize in Urban Design]], awarded by [[Harvard University]], due to PUI Integral Urban Project Northeast area, designed and implemented by Development Corporation Urbano. Medellín retains very little colonial architecture from the nineteenth century. Although the Aburrá Valley was a hotspot in agriculture and livestock throughout the colonial period, their relative wealth is not expressed in an outstanding and Cartagena, Tunja, Popayán and Bogotá civil and religious architecture. This can be explained by the fact that the population of Medellín was not political and administrative center and a place geographically isolated whose elite invested little in the development of monumental architecture. From the end of the colony remain, but with many transformations, the Candelaria Church and the Church of the Veracruz.

The architecture produced in Colombia between 1850 and 1930 is called "Republican". The use of brick and implementation of European historical styles were the main novelty. Enrique Haeusler designed the Guayaquil Bridge in 1879. But it was the French architect Carlos Carré who headlined Republican nineteenth century architecture in Medellín. Carré came to town in 1889 and was hired to design and build the new Episcopal Cathedral and several commercial and residential buildings for different parts of the city, especially in the new neighborhood of Guayaquil. The Metropolitan Cathedral was completed in 1931; also are of authorship Vásquez and Carré buildings, which are located next to [[Plaza Cisneros]]. The Medellín Antioquia Railway Station was the work of Enrique Olarte, a work that allowed the definitive urban consolidation in Guayaquil sector. In the twenties Republican architecture reached its peak phase. In this period stand the old Municipal Palace (now the Museum of Antioquia) in 1928, the National Palace and the Palace of Departmental Government (now the Palace of Culture) between 1925 and 1928. The latter two works were designed by the Belgian architect [[Agustín Goovaerts]], both inspired by the Belgian modernist, it applied the Romanesque and Gothic styles respectively. Other works of Goovaerts were the Church of the Sacred Heart (sector Guayaquil), the Church of San Ignacio, among others. The thirties highlighted such constructions of the Prado neighborhood as the Egyptian house and the current Teatro Prado.

===Parks===
The main parks of the city include [[Berrío Park]] in the center of the city; [[Bolívar Park (Medellín, Colombia)|Bolívar Park]], a little further north and framed by the Metropolitan Cathedral; and others in more residential areas like Bethlehem Park, El Poblado Park, and Laureles Park. Several modern parks are interactive and have had a positive reception from the people because they are not only places of recreation but also of education. These include Barefoot Park, Wishes Park, [[Explora Park]], and Bicentennial Park (which was recently opened to mark the bicentenary of Colombia).

One of the most visited sites is the [[Arví Ecotourism Park]], which has an area of about 20,000 hectares located between the towns of Medellín, [[Bello, Antioquia|Bello]], [[Copacabana, Antioquia|Copacabana]], and [[Envigado]]. In its trails, lakes, forests and streams, one can practice various sports and activities like trekking, kayaking, biking, camping, fishing, swimming, sailing rowing, horseback riding, bike tours and picnics. Its promontory position over Medellín offers natural landscapes overlooking over the entire city. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The city is surrounded from above by seven hills, which serve as natural viewpoints of the city and are sites for healthy leisure, recreation, enjoyment, research, sport, culture, education and ecotourism. The hills are El Volador, La Asomadera, [[Nutibara Hill|Nutibara]], Pan de Azúcar, El Salvador, El Picacho and Santo Domingo. In these natural public spaces one can find viewpoints, pre-Hispanic roads, religious icons, culture and Antioquian traditions, bird watching, the most complete herbal living of [[Aburrá Valley]] and the very few, if any, remains of early settlers native of Medellín, among other attractions.

Other parks in the city include North Park and Juan Pablo II Park. The Santa Fe Zoo, founded in 1960, has about 1,000 animals from Asia, Africa, and the Americas.

Medellín universities, public and private, also played a role, along with official institutions both local and national.

==Transportation==

===Air transportation===
[[File:2018 aeropuerto internacional José María Córdova, vista aérea.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[José María Córdova International Airport]]]]

Medellín has two airports, [[Olaya Herrera Airport]] (EOH), and [[José María Córdova Airport]] (MDE), which is located in the city of [[Rionegro]], {{convert|29|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} east of the city of Medellín. In 2012 the busiest domestic flight route was between Jose Maria Cordova Airport and [[Bogotá]] while the busiest international route was between Jose Maria Cordova Airport and [[Panama City]].

The [[José María Córdova International Airport|Jose Maria Cordova Airport]] receives international flights from important carriers such as [[Aeromexico]], [[American Airlines]], [[Avianca]], [[Iberia Airlines|Iberia]], [[JetBlue]], [[Spirit Airlines]], [[Air Europa]], and [[LATAM Airlines]] and cargo airlines such as [[Fed Ex Express]], which makes the city accessible from the many regions of America, both for passengers and cargo customers. [[Avianca]], the flag air-carrier of Colombia, has also an important activity at this airport. This airport has direct flights to important international destinations such as Lima, Quito, Mexico City, Madrid, Miami, Houston, and New York City.

===Land transportation===
Medellín has two transportation terminals, the North Transportation Terminal and the South Transportation Terminal. The city's public transport system includes diesel buses, taxis, tram and an urban train referred to as the [[Medellín Metro]], the only metro system in Colombia.

[[File:Metro de Medellin- Linea B sector San Javier.JPG|thumbnail|[[Medellín Metro]] is the only [[metro system]] in Colombia.]]
The Metro connects the city with most of its metropolitan area. It has five lines. Line A goes from [[Niquía station|Niquía]] to [[La Estrella station|La Estrella]] (north to south), while Line B goes from [[San Antonio station (Medellín)|San Antonio]] to [[San Javier station|San Javier]] (downtown to west). In addition, Line K and Line J, an air cable car, locally known as [[Metrocable (Medellín)|Metrocable]], serve a depressed and geographically difficult area. Line K begins at Acevedo Station on Metro Line A, and continues uphill, ending at Santo Domingo Savio. Line J begins at San Javier Station on Metro Line B, and continues uphill to La Aurora. Line L does not serve communal areas, rather, it is a tourist-oriented line which is connected to [[Arví Park]] and is part of a social project to bring retreats and nature to the masses.<ref>[[Metrocable (Medellín)#cite note-4]]</ref> Colombia has become Latin America's largest user of such complementary transportation service throughout the country.

[[File:Tunel de Occidente.jpg|thumb|left|Western Tunnel, the longest tunnel in Latin America]]
In 2006, construction began on Metroplús, a [[bus rapid transit]] service with a dedicated road, much like Bogotá's [[TransMilenio]], to allow faster transit for the service's buses. The first line opened two years later than planned in 2011 and a second in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medellín BRT data|url=http://www.brtdata.org/#/location/latin_america/colombia/medellin|publisher=Embarq|access-date=21 August 2014|archive-date=8 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208053814/http://brtdata.org/#/location/latin_america/colombia/medellin|url-status=live}}</ref> The first leg is the ''Troncal Medellín'', which goes from the Universidad de Medellín in the west to Aranjuez in the northeast part of the city. Metroplus will help lessen the city's pollution and traffic, as many old buses will be taken out of service, while the new buses will work with natural gas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metroplus.gov.co/metroplus/index.php?sub_cat=41&idx=11&ap=8 |title=Metroplús acercó a los visitantes del #FMB4 con los artistas de la bicicleta &#124; Metroplús |publisher=Metroplus.gov.co |access-date=2018-06-28}}</ref>

Originally, [[trams in Medellin|trams in Medellín]] were the most important transportation until 1950, but, after that, the rapidly increasing population and number of automobiles forcefully closed it in 1951. However, more than 60 years later, a new [[Translohr]] system (rubber-tired "tram"), the [[Ayacucho Tram]], the first modern "tram" in Colombia, was opened on September 30, 2015. It is integrated with the metro system and the local bus network.

====Public transportation statistics====
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Medellín, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 66 min. 12% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 14% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 5.9&nbsp;km, while 5% travel for over 12&nbsp;km in a single direction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medellín Public Transportation Statistics|publisher=Global Public Transit Index by Moovit|url=https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_Colombia_Medellin-1642|access-date=June 19, 2017|archive-date=September 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901023231/https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_Colombia_Medellin-1642|url-status=live}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016050101/https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ |date=2017-10-16 }}.</ref>

The [[Chocó Department]] is just west of Antioquia, and is home to many Afro-Colombian and Zambo-Colombian migrants to Medellín and its vicinity. Migration from the Colombian Caribbean coast has been important, especially that of young people who come to study in Medellín universities and remain to work in the city.

==Culture==

The culture in Medellín is strongly linked to a broader Paisa culture (see next section) whose unique attributes include their Spanish accent, cuisine, and hospitality. Today, Medellín has several cultural attractions for the public including approximately 40 museums, 21 public parks, 28 theaters, and several public libraries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://medellin.travel/en/where-can-i-go|title=Where can I go?|publisher=Medellín Convention & Visitors Bureau|access-date=5 January 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127010605/http://www.medellin.travel/en/where-can-i-go|archive-date=27 January 2012|df=dmy}}</ref> The city also contains several fixtures that have been designated [[National monuments of Colombia]].

Most people in Medellín are [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], as reflected by Medellín's several churches and religious activities. Among the most representative churches are the [[Metropolitan Cathedral of Medellín|Metropolitan Cathedral]], the largest cathedral in the world built entirely in baked brick. There is also the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Candelaria]], which was the official cathedral until 1931; the [[Church of San Ignacio (Medellín)|Church of San Ignacio]], Baroque on the outside and Colonial on inside; the [[Church of San José (Medellín)|Church of San José]]; the [[Church of San Antonio (Medellín)|Church of San Antonio]], which has one of the biggest domes in Colombia; the [[Church of San José del Poblado]], located in the Parque del Poblado where the first European settlement in the [[Aburrá Valley]] was founded in 1616; and the [[Church of Nuestra Señora de Belén (Medellín)|Church of Nuestra Señora de Belén]]. All of these churches have religious art and are located in the center of the city, which facilitates journeys among them.

In December, the city is covered with thousands of fairy lights, creating the famous ''[[Christmas lights in Medellín|Alumbrados]]'' (Christmas lights), which are considered by the [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] as one of the ten most beautiful in the world,<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/holiday-lights-photos|title = Top 10 Places to See Holiday Lights| website=[[National Geographic Society]] |access-date = 22 December 2011|archive-date = 28 December 2011|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111228121147/http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/holiday-lights-photos#/05-light-displays-colombia_41299_600x450.jpg|url-status = live}}</ref> and which can be seen mainly on ''La Playa'' Avenue and the Medellín River.

[[File:Pano Plazo Botero.jpg|thumb|Plaza Botero, in the background the [[Museum of Antioquia]]|362x362px]]
[[Plaza Mayor, Medellín|Plaza Mayor]] is the epicenter of large events and business. By a decree of the municipal government, between 1980 and 1990 all developments or tall buildings necessarily included a sculpture of a famous artist. That is one reason why Medellín has the largest number of sculptures per square kilometer in Colombia.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Furthermore, the city has several festivals and exhibitions year-round. The [[sillero|silletero]] tradition is also closely tied to the region and is considered a part of Colombian [[cultural heritage]]. Since 1957, this tradition has continued in the Silleta Parade that takes place during the annual [[Festival of the Flowers]], where silletas designed with flower arrangements are carried.

Works of many prominent artists, both local and foreign, can be seen on the streets of the city. Some artists who stand out are the masters [[Rodrigo Arenas Betancur]] and [[Fernando Botero]].

===Paisa culture===
{{Main|Paisa region}}
The inhabitants of Medellín are often called ''Antioqueños'' (people of Antioquia) after their province, rather than ''Medellínenses'' (people of Medellín) after their city. They are also often known as ''[[Paisa Region|Paisas]]'', a name which some suggest comes from the coffee growers. The term ''Paisa'' comes from the word ''paisano'', meaning "fellow countryman". ''Paisas'' make up one of the five different regional cultures within Colombia. In addition to Antioquia, the [[Paisa region]] includes the departments of [[Caldas Department|Caldas]], [[Risaralda Department|Risaralda]], [[Quindio]] and some towns of [[Valle del Cauca]] and [[Department of Tolima|Tolima]]. Although Paisa culture is dominant in Medellín, the so-called "Paisa Capital", the city is becoming more cosmopolitan, now offering music from other regions of Colombia ([[Vallenato]] and [[Department of Chocó|Chocó]]), and a variety of restaurants including Chinese, Cuban, and Argentinian.

The Paisa culture has a Spanish background, and is traditionally Catholic, and entrepreneurial.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Paisas are said to speak softly and quickly, to smile easily, and to love music, poetry, soccer, bargaining in the markets, and parties. They are proud of their city, and work hard to keep it clean, stemming from the campaign begun in the 1980s, "Depende tambien de ti, darle amor a Medellín" (It depends on you too to give love to Medellín). The Medellín weekend nightlife, in discos, pubs, parks, and certain dedicated streets, is traditionally called ''rumba''.<ref name="MattBrown">{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Matthew|url=http://albeiror24.wordpress.com/2008/03/11/colombia-an-emerging-travel-destination/|title=Colombia: An Emerging Travel Destination|date=11 March 2008|access-date=2008-05-04|archive-date=2008-05-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516121049/http://albeiror24.wordpress.com/2008/03/11/colombia-an-emerging-travel-destination/|url-status=live}}</ref>

However, a more refined and structured in heraldic language, though not official, would be:

{{blockquote|In an [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]] field, a round tower of gold stands, masoned and clarified by sable, with a checkered escutcheon of 15 pieces – 7 blue and 8 gold (coat of arms of [[House of Portocarrero]]) – stamped with an ancient crown of gold between its two towers, with a cloud upon which stands the image of Our Lady of Candelaria carrying the Child in her left arm, a candle in her right hand, radiant, she is flanked by forming clouds from each county.}}

The blazon has remained over time since it was granted, without further changes to the aesthetics, it is noteworthy that there are different stylistic versions between the Mayor and City Council also meets aesthetic not heraldic standards.

===Flag===
To strengthen the links with the region, the municipality adopted the [[flag of the Department of Antioquia]], which was added to the coat of arms of the city, so that these could make difference. The flag consists of two horizontal stripes of equal proportions, the white top and green bottom, and in the middle between two strips is located the coat. The white color symbolizes purity, integrity, obedience, firmness and eloquence. The green represents hope, abundance, freedom and faith.

===Anthem===
The anthem of the city of Medellín is "Anthem of Antioquia", according to Decree No. 151 of February 20, 2002, Article 10, which says: "Anthem of Medellín. To unify the ideals of the region the Antioquia anthem is adopted (lyrics by [[Epifanio Mejia]] and music by Gonzalo Vidal) as the Anthem of the Municipality of Medellín. It will be sung in all official functions where the Mayor of Medellín is present."
