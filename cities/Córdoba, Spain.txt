It is the third most populated [[Municipalities in Spain|municipality]] in Andalusia.

The city primarily lies on the right bank of the [[Guadalquivir]] in the south of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Once a [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman colonia]], it was taken over by the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] followed by the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Muslim conquest in the eighth century]]. Córdoba became the capital of the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]], from which the [[Umayyad dynasty]] ruled all of [[al-Andalus]] until 1031. Under Umayyad rule, Córdoba was transformed into a centre of education and learning,<ref name="Barton2009">{{cite book |first=Simon |last=Barton |title=A History of Spain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AeAcBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA44 |date=30 June 2009 |publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education |isbn=978-1-137-01347-7 |pages=44–5 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200726002002/https://books.google.com/books?id=AeAcBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA44#v=onepage&q&f=false |archive-date=26 July 2020 }}</ref><ref name="Venable1894">{{cite book |author=Francis Preston Venable |title=A Short History of Chemistry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fN9YAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA21 |year=1894 |publisher=Heath |page=21 }}</ref> and by the 10th century it had grown to be the second-largest city in Europe.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVYT4Kraym0C&q=cordoba+surpassed+and+constantinople&pg=PA448 |title=The Spread of Islam Throughout the World |first1=Idris El |last1=Hareir |first2=Ravane |last2=Mbaye |date=10 April 2011 |publisher=UNESCO |isbn=9789231041532 }}</ref><ref name=Population/>

Al-Andalus experienced a manyfold political crisis in the early 11th century that brought about [[state collapse]]. Following the [[Siege of Córdoba (1236)|Christian conquest in 1236]], it became part of the [[Crown of Castile]] as the head of the [[Kingdom of Córdoba]].

Córdoba is home to notable examples of [[Moorish architecture]] such as the [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba|Mezquita-Catedral]], which was named as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1984 and is now a cathedral. The site has since been expanded to encompass the whole [[historic centre of Córdoba]]. [[Madinat al-Zahra]] near the city is also a World Heritage Site while the [[Courtyards Festival of Córdoba|Festival de los Patios]] has been recognized as [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage]].

Córdoba has the [[Córdoba, Spain#Climate|highest summer temperatures in Spain]] and Europe, with average high temperatures around {{cvt|37|C|F}} in July and August.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=5402&k=and |title=Standard climate values for Córdoba |publisher=[[Agencia Estatal de Meteorología]] |access-date=11 April 2015 }}</ref> Summers are very dry whereas the mild winters have frequent rainfall.

==Etymology==

The name ''Córdoba'' has attracted fanciful explanations. One theory, suggested in 1799 by [[José Antonio Conde]], is that the name comes from [[Punic language|Punic]] ''qart ṭūbah'' "good town" as Córdoba was founded during [[Carthaginian Iberia]]. After the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] conquest, the town's name was Latinised as ''Corduba''.<ref>{{Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Edition|volume=5|article=Ḳurṭuba|last1=Seybold|first1=C.F.|last2=Ocaña Jiménez|first2=M.|pages=509–512 }}</ref> During the era of Muslim rule the city was known in [[Arabic]] as {{transl|ar|DIN|Qurṭubah}} ({{Langx|ar|قرطبة|links=no}}).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hillenbrand |first=Robert |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cbfORLWv1HkC&dq=cordoba+city+arabic+qurtuba&pg=PA112 |title=The Legacy of Muslim Spain |publisher=Brill |year=1992 |isbn=978-90-04-09599-1 |editor-last=Jayyusi |editor-first=Salma Khadra |pages=112 |language=en |chapter="The Ornament of the World": Medieval Córdoba as a Cultural Centre |editor-last2=Marín |editor-first2=Manuela |access-date=29 January 2023 |archive-date=8 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230408085751/https://books.google.com/books?id=cbfORLWv1HkC&dq=cordoba+city+arabic+qurtuba&pg=PA112 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the context of the [[Early Modern Period]], the city experienced a golden age between 1530 and 1580, profiting from an economic activity based on the trade of [[Agriculture|agricultural product]]s and the preparation of clothes originally from [[Los Pedroches]], peaking at a population of about 50,000 by 1571.{{Sfn|Villar Movellán|1998|p=102}} A period of stagnation and ensuing decline followed.{{Sfn|Villar Movellán|1998|p=102}}

The second half of the 19th century saw the arrival of railway transport via the opening of the Seville–Córdoba line on 2 June 1859.{{Sfn|López Serrano|2017|p=587}}

Córdoba was connected by railway to [[Jerez]] and [[Cádiz]] in 1861 and, in 1866, following the link with [[Manzanares, Ciudad Real|Manzanares]], with [[Madrid]].{{Sfn|López Serrano|2017|p=589}} The city was eventually connected to [[Málaga]] and [[Belmez, Córdoba|Belmez]].{{Sfn|López Serrano|2017|pp=593–597}}

==Geography==
=== Location ===
[[File:Las Ermitas panorama Córdoba 3.jpg|thumb|500px|right|View of Córdoba from the ''Sierra'' foothills]]
Córdoba is located in the south of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], in the [[Baetic Depression|Guadalquivir depression]] formed by the [[Guadalquivir|Guadalquivir river]], that cuts across the city in an east-north east to west-south west direction. The wider municipality extends across an area of 1,254.25&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ssweb.seap.minhap.es/REL/frontend/inicio/municipios/1/13387 |access-date=15 August 2020 |publisher=Ministerio de Asuntos Económicos y Transformación Digital |title=Datos del Registro de Entidades Locales |archive-date=3 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210203114934/https://ssweb.seap.minhap.es/REL/frontend/inicio/municipios/1/13387 |url-status=live }}</ref> making it the largest municipality in [[Andalusia]] and the fourth largest in Spain.{{Sfn|Burgueño|Guerrero Lladós|2014|p=19}}

The city of Córdoba lies in the middle course of the river. Three major landscape units in the municipality include the Sierra (as in the southern reaches of [[Sierra Morena]]), the Valley proper and the ''Campiña''.{{Sfn|Torres Márquez|2013|p=138}}

The differences in elevation in the Valley are very small, ranging from 100 and 170 metres above sea level,{{Sfn|Torres Márquez|2013|p=138}} with the city proper located at an average altitude of roughly 125 metres above sea level.{{Sfn|Domínguez Bascón|1995|p=283}} The landscape of the valley is further subdivided in the ''piedmont'' connecting with the Sierra, the [[fluvial terrace]]s and the most immediate vicinity of the river course.{{Sfn|Torres Márquez|2013|p=138}}

The [[Miocene]] ''Campiña'', located in the southern bank of the Guadalquivir, features a hilly landscape gently increasing in height up to about 200 m.{{Sfn|Domínguez Bascón|1995|p=283}} In the ''Sierra'', to the north of the city, the altitude increases relatively abruptly up to 500 meters.{{Sfn|Domínguez Bascón|1995|p=283}} Both the ''Sierra'' and the ''Campiña'' display viewpoints over the valley.{{Sfn|Torres Márquez|2013|p=138}}

Winters are mild, yet cooler than other low lying cities in southern Spain due to its interior location, wedged between the Sierra Morena and the Penibaetic System. Precipitation is concentrated in the coldest months; this is due to the [[Mediterranean climate|dry summer climate pattern]] featured in large parts of the Iberian Peninsula. Precipitation is generated by storms from the west that occur most frequently from December to February. This Atlantic characteristic then gives way to a hot summer with significant drought more typical of Mediterranean climates. Annual rain surpasses {{cvt|600|mm|0}}, although it is recognized to vary from year to year.

In July 2022, there were 19 days with highs over {{cvt|40|C|F}} and 30 days with highs over {{cvt|35|C|F}}, with the average high of {{cvt|40.4|C|F}} for that month, which is the highest ever recorded in the country and in Europe among all cities with a population over 100,000.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Moya |first=Miguel |date=4 August 2022 |title=Julio a 40.4 °C: récord en la media mensual de las máximas de Córdoba Aeropuerto |url=https://cordopolis.eldiario.es/el-tiempo/climatologia/julio-40-4-0c-record-media-mensual-maximas-cordoba-aeropuerto_1_9220032.html |access-date=19 January 2024 |website=Cordópolis |language=es }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Córdoba Aeropuerto - Valores Extremos |url=https://www.aemet.es/es/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/efemerides_extremos*?w=0&k=and&l=5402&datos=det&x=5402&m=7&v=TMMA |access-date=19 January 2024 |website=[[Agencia Estatal de Meteorologia]] |archive-date=19 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240119194840/https://www.aemet.es/es/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/efemerides_extremos*?w=0&k=and&l=5402&datos=det&x=5402&m=7&v=TMMA |url-status=live }}</ref> The registered maximum temperature at the [[Córdoba Airport]], located at {{cvt|6|km|0|abbr=off}} from the city, was {{cvt|46.9|C|F|1}} on 13 July 2017 and 14 August 2021.<ref name="OGIMET">{{cite web |url=https://www.ogimet.com/cgi-bin/gsynres?ind=08410&ano=2021&mes=8&day=15&hora=0&min=0&ndays=30 |title=08410: Cordoba / Aeropuerto (Spain) |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=14 August 2021 |website=ogimet.com |publisher=[[OGIMET]] |access-date=14 August 2021 |quote= |archive-date=15 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210815011305/https://www.ogimet.com/cgi-bin/gsynres?ind=08410&ano=2021&mes=8&day=15&hora=0&min=0&ndays=30 |url-status=live }}</ref> The lowest registered temperature was {{cvt|-8.2|C|F|1}}, on 28 January 2005.<ref name=aemet>{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/efemerides_extremos*?w=0&k=and&l=5402&datos=det&x=5402&m=13&v=todos |title=Valores climatológicos extremos.

===Christian===
[[File:Puerta del Puente, Córdoba (España).JPG|alt=|thumb|[[Puerta del Puente]]]]{{More citations needed section|date=February 2022}}
Surrounding the large Old town are the [[Roman walls of Córdoba|Roman walls]]: gates include the Puerta de Almodóvar, the Puerta de Sevilla and [[Puerta del Puente]], which are the only three gates remaining from the original thirteen. Towers and fortresses include the [[Torre de la Malmuerta|Malmuerta Tower]], [[Torre de Belén]] and the Puerta del Rincón's Tower.

In the south of the Old town and east of the great cathedral, in the [[Plaza del Potro]], is the ''Posada del Potro'', a row of [[inn]]s mentioned in literary works including ''Don Quixote'' and ''La Feria de los Discretos'', and which remained active until 1972. Both the plaza and the inn get their name from the fountain in the centre of the plaza, which represents a foal (''potro''). Not far from this plaza is the ''Arco del Portillo'' (a 14th-century arch). In the extreme southwest of the Old Town is the [[Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos]], a former royal property and the seat of the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]]; adjacent to it are the [[Royal Stables of Córdoba|Royal Stables]], where [[Andalusian horse]]s are bred. Palace buildings in the Old Town include the ''Palacio de Viana'' (14th century) and the ''[[Palacio de la Merced]]'' among others. Other sights include the ''Cuesta del Bailío'' (a staircase connecting the upper and lower part of the city).

====Fernandine churches====
The city is home to 12 Christian churches that were built (many as transformations of mosques) by Ferdinand III of Castile after the reconquest of the city in the 13th century. They were to act both as churches and as the administrative centres in the neighborhoods into which the city was divided in medieval times. Some of those that remain are:

In the Guadalquivir river, near the San Rafael Bridge is the Island of the sculptures, an artificial island with a dozen stone sculptures executed during the International Sculpture Symposium. Up the river, near the Miraflores bridge, is the "Hombre Río", a sculpture of a swimmer looking to the sky and whose orientation varies depending on the current.

====Bridges====
* San Rafael Bridge, consisting of eight arches of 25&nbsp;m span and a length of 217&nbsp;m. The width is between parapets, divided into 12&nbsp;m of cobblestone for four circulations and two tiled concrete sidewalks. It was inaugurated on 29 April 1953 joining the Avenue Corregidor with Plaza de Andalucía. In January 2004 the plaques reading "His Excellency the Head of State and Generalissimo of all the Armies, Francisco Franco Bahamonde, opened this bridge of the Guadalquivir on 29 April 1953", which were on both sides of each of the entrances of the bridge, were removed.
* Andalusia Bridge, a suspension bridge.
* ''Puente de Miraflores'', known as "the rusty bridge". This bridge links the Street San Fernando and Ronda de Isasa with the Miraflores peninsula.

* Autovía del Sur Bridge.
* Abbas Ibn Firnas Bridge, Inaugurated in January 2011 It is part of the variant west of Córdoba.
* ''Puente del Arenal'', connecting Avenue Campo de la Verdad with the Recinto Ferial (fairground) of Córdoba.
