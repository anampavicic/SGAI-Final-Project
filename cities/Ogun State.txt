Ogun State is divided into three senatorial districts: Ogun Central, Ogun East and Ogun West.

Ogun Central consists mostly of the Egbas that occupies six local governments: Abeokuta North (Akomoje), Abeokuta south (Ake), Ewekoro (Itori), Ifo (Ifo), Obafemi owode (Owode ẹgba) and Odeda (Odeda).

Ogun East consists mostly of the Ijebus and the Remos that occupies 9 local governments: Ijebu East (Ogbẹrẹ), Ijebu North (Ijebu Igbo), Ijebu North East (Attan), Ijebu ode (Ijebu ode), Ikenne (Ikenne remo), Odogbolu (Odogbolu), Ogun waterside (Abigi), Remo North (Ilisan Remo) and Sagamu (Sagamu).

Ogun West consists mostly of the Yewas (formerly Egbados) that occupies 5 local governments: Ado odo Ota (Otta), Imeko Afon (Imeko), Ipokia (Ipokia), Yewa North (Ayetoro) and Yewa South (Ilaro).

== History ==
In pre-colonial times, today's Ogun belonged to the [[Oyo Empire|kingdom of Oyo]], which sank into [[civil war]] around 1800. South of Ogun, on the tiny island of [[Lagos]], the British had a naval base near which the town of the same name grew rapidly.

Until the [[Berlin Conference|Berlin Congo Conference]] in 1885, Great Britain had focussed on a few strategically placed bases for its merchant fleet and navy, such as Lagos and [[Calabar]], and was not interested in the communities developing there.

After the European colonial powers had staked out their spheres of interest 1885 in [[Berlin]] (these were only valid if another power had not previously brought the area in question under its control) the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] quickly expanded thusly its territory in the assigned Niger region. The British attack on the Kingdom of Oyo in 1891 was the first step, the [[History of Nigeria#The punitive expedition to the Kingdom of Benin in 1897|punitive expedition against Benin]] 1896 the second. Today's Ogun became part of the "Protectorate of Lagos" (as opposed to the [[Colony of Lagos|''Colony'' of Lagos]]; the border between these two is identical to the modern border between [[Lagos State]] and Ogun State - inhabitants of a colony were treated as fully entitled subjects of the British crown, those in protectorates not) in 1893 and later of the "Protectorate of Yorubaland", in 1906 of the "Protectorate of Southern Nigeria" and in 1914 of the whole of Nigeria. In 1899, it received a railway connection to Lagos, the "Boat Express" ran through Ogun to [[Apapa]] and thus connected the region with the wider world. In 1899, it was several years earlier in this than other regions in West and Central Africa that were not connected to the coast.

In the 1930s, Ogun was a centre of the [[Abeokuta Women's Revolt|Nigerian women's movement]] under the leadership of [[Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti]] ([[Fela Kuti|Fela Kuti's]] mother). Democracy in colonial Nigeria after 1922 only existed in Lagos and Calabar; Nigerians could not participate politically elsewhere (see [[History of Nigeria#Governor Clifford, the Clifford Constitution|here]]).

During the 1940s, food was strictly rationed in Nigeria. The transport of food from the more agrarian Ogun to the hungry metropolis of Lagos was severely penalised (Pullen Scheme, see [[History of Nigeria#Rationing, price control, agricultural damage, education offensive|here]]).

In the first elections in Ogun, 1954, the semi-socialist "Action Group" (AG) under [[Obafemi Awolowo|Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀]] became the strongest party in the Western Region, to which Ogun also belonged.

After independence in 1960, the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] region, and Ogun in particular, was engulfed in conflict between the [[Obafemi Awolowo|Ọbáfẹ́mi Awólọ́wọ̀]] and [[Ladoke Akintola|Samuel Ládòkè Akíntọ́lá]] fractions of the AG party ("Operation Wetie", see [[History of Nigeria#Independence, First Republic (1960/1963 - 1966)|here]]). In July 1966, the then ruler of Nigeria, [[Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi|Johnson Agulyi-Ironsi]], was assassinated in [[Abeokuta]] in the second coup of the year, which was the prelude to the [[Nigerian Civil War|Biafra War]].

The state was formed on 3 February 1976 from part of the former "Western" state.

== Economy ==
The state has a very high concentration of industries (the second most industrialized after [[Lagos State]]) and has one of the lowest incidences of [[extreme poverty]] (around 5% of the population against a national average of 31%) according to [[World Bank]] data from 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Geospatial Poverty Portal: Interactive Maps |url=https://pipmaps.worldbank.org/en/data/datatopics/poverty-portal/poverty-interactivemap |access-date=2024-01-22 |website=World Bank |language=en}}</ref>

=== Primary sector ===
Mining and agriculture are among the most important economic sectors in Ogun. [[Limestone]], [[chalk]], [[phosphate]] and [[gravel]] are mined and [[grain]], [[rice]], [[maize]], [[cassava]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[banana]]s, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[kola nut]]s, [[rubber]], [[palm oil]] and [[palm kernel]]s are harvested. The state is the largest producer of kolanut in Nigeria.

=== Secondary sector, metal processing ===
Ogún is also the name of the god ([[Orisha]]) for metalworking in the local Yoruba nature religion, similar to the Greek [[Hephaestus]] or the Roman god [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] (since the ancient world had trade relations with present-day Nigeria, this may not be entirely coincidental). The state lives up to this name by being the Nigerian centre for metalworking. Here are two examples:

* Proforce manufactures armoured vehicles in Ode-Remo (25&nbsp;km from Lagos), which are also sold to Europe.<ref>{{Citation |title=Nigeria's Proforce to Supply Armored Vehicles to Belarus | date=15 March 2022 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UsIxh0h9tg |access-date=2024-02-26 |language=en}}</ref> Since 2008, the company has expanded its product range and also produces drones for the security sector.<ref>{{Citation |title=Profroce Puts Nigeria On World Map Through Manufacturing Of Quality Military Hardware | date=22 February 2024 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiviBEXfE-4 |access-date=2024-02-26 |language=en}}</ref>
* The wagon assembly plant in [[Kajola]] is the only plant in West Africa that manufactures, maintains and repairs railway vehicles.<ref>{{Citation |title=FG Commissions Kajola Wagon Assembly Plant In Ogun State | date=23 May 2023 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7WbNm9ArRM |access-date=2024-02-26 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Anagor-Ewuzie |first=Amaka |date=2023-05-23 |title=Nigeria's first wagon assembly plant to produce 500 yearly |url=https://businessday.ng/transport/article/nigerias-first-wagon-assembly-plant-to-produce-500-yearly/ |access-date=2024-02-26 |website=Businessday NG |language=en-US}}</ref>
Ogun also produces [[timber]], ceramic products, bicycle tyres, carpets, adhesives and other products.

== Transportation ==
Ogun benefits from its proximity to the metropolis of [[Lagos]] and the new [[Lekki Port|deep-sea harbour]] and the new [[Dangote Refinery|Dangote refinery]] in Lekki (as of 2024). The planned airport Lagos-Epe will be located next to the border to the state of Ogun.

=== Railways ===

==== Nigerian Railway Company ====
Ogun benefits from the Lagos-[[Abeokuta]]-[[Ibadan]] standard rail link since 2021.

The planned ''Apapa-Kajola Express'' will connect the centre of the state with the Lagos port.<ref>{{Citation |title=Nigerian Railway Introduces New Express Train |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b58PXXT2dfY |access-date=2024-02-26 |language=en}}</ref>

Abeokuta also is connected with Lagos by 77&nbsp;km of the [[Nigerian Railways|Western Railway]] (built in 1899), which still is used for freight trains.

==== Lagos Mass Transit (Lamata) ====
The terminus of the "Red Line" of the Lagos suburban railway is located in Agbado, which is part of the Lagos agglomeration but belongs to the state of Ogun in administrative terms. This is why the trains and carriages of Lagos State will be parked, cleaned and maintained in Ogun.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lagos Redline Metro – First metro infrastructure limited |url=https://first-metro.com/lagos-redline-metro/ |access-date=2024-02-26 |language=en-US}}</ref>
