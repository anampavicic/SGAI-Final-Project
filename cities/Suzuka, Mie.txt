==History==
Suzuka, as a place name, is mentioned in the [[Nara period]] chronicle ''[[Nihon Shoki]]''. The ancient [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]] passed through Suzuka, and the Nara-period [[kokufu|provincial capital]] was within its borders. During the [[Sengoku period]], the area was controlled by [[Oda Nobutaka]], the third son of [[Oda Nobunaga]], who ruled from [[Kanbe Castle]]. During the [[Edo period]], much of the area was under the control of the 15,000 ''[[koku]]'' [[Kanbe Domain]], ruled by the [[Honda clan]] from 1732 until the [[Meiji restoration]] in 1871. During this period, two [[shukuba|post stations]] were within the modern city limits: [[Ishiyakushi-juku]] and [[Shōno-juku]], which prospered due to pilgrimage traffic to the [[Ise Grand Shrine]].

After the start of the [[Meiji period]], the area was organized as part of [[Suzuka District, Mie|Suzuka District]] in 1889 and the town of Kanbe was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. On December 1, 1942, Kanbe merged with the villages of Shirako, Inau, Iino, Kawano, Ichinomiya, Mida, Tanagaki, Wakamatsu, Ko, Shono, Takatsuse, Makita, and Ishiyakushi to form the city of Suzuka. The city further expanded in 1954 by annexing the villages of Sakae, Amana and Aikawa and portions of neighboring Kameyama.

==Government==
Suzuka has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 32 members. Suzuka contributes four members to the Mie Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Mie 2nd district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Suzuka boasts a significant industrial market, having major factories for [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] and [[Honda]] in its bounds. These companies outsource part of their labor to South American nationals to secure a contract-based workforce.

Although the Japanese government encourages mandatory English-language education across the nation, in Suzuka many courses are offered by private cram schools (''[[juku]]'') and by publicly funded institutions supporting [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. In a controversial move, the city's governing body, from April 2004, requires all garbage information and local signage to be in Japanese and Portuguese (but not English).

==Education==
===Colleges and universities===
*[[Suzuka International University]]
*[[Suzuka Junior College]]

*[[Suzuka University of Medical Science]]

===Primary and secondary education===
