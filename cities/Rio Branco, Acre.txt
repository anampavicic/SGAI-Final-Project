'''Rio Branco''' ({{IPA|pt|ˈʁi.u ˈbɾɐ̃ku}}, ''White River'') is a Brazilian [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]], capital of the state of [[Acre (state)|Acre]]. Located in the valley of the [[Acre River]] in [[northern Brazil]], it is the most populous municipality in the [[States of Brazil|state]], with 387,852 inhabitants, according to 2024 [[IBGE]] estimates,<ref name="auto"/> almost half the state population. Rio Branco was one of the [[History of Brazil#Rubber|first settlements]] to develop in the region, being the westernmost major settlement in the country and the 4th-oldest state capital city in [[North Region, Brazil|Northern Brazil]], after [[Belém]], [[Manaus]] and [[Macapá]].

In 1913, it became a county. In 1920, it became the capital of the territory of Acre, and in 1962, the state capital. It is the administrative center for the economic, political and cultural region.

== History ==

{{main|Treaty of Petrópolis}}

[[File:Grande_enchente_do_Rio_Acre,_Alto_Acre,_Vila_de_Rio_Branco_(AC).tif|thumb|left|Rio Branco, Brazil, 1908.]]
The capital of the state of [[Acre (state)|Acre]] developed from the [[Natural rubber|rubber]] plantation founded on December 28, [[1882]], by migrant settlers from the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Region of Brazil]]. Then called Seringal Volta da Empresa, it was located on the right bank of the [[Acre river]]. The [[strangler fig|Gameleira]] tree marks this site. This is now classified as the Second District of the city.

Almost 150 years ago, the construction of workers' shacks had begun, in lands previously occupied by the [[Aquiri]], [[Canamari]], and [[Maneteri]] Amazonian indigenous tribes. Years later, the same Gameleira tree survived the battles fought at Volta da Empresa, between Acre revolutionaries and Bolivian troops, during the critical period of the [[Acre War]]. As a result, Brazil acquired Acre at the beginning of the 20th century.

By August 1904, Villa Rio Branco had become the main urban center of the entire Acre valley, and was the richest and most productive in the region. During this period of the rubber boom, the streets around the Gameleira were the center of commercial and urban life in this part of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]]. Bars, cafes, and casinos supplied the city's nightlife; commercial representatives came here of the chief national and foreign [[Aviation]] houses that handled thousands of [[Brazilian real (old)|Contos de Réis]]. There were many wealthy families in the city.

The urban elite was largely composed of liberal professionals and civil servants. The political administration of the Territory was transferred to the left bank of the Acre River, because its lands were higher and not as subject to [[flood]]ing as the old city centre. The early commercial zone gradually became dominated by [[Syrian Brazilians|Syrian]] and [[Lebanese Brazilian|Lebanese]] immigrants. By the mid-[[1930s]], one area was known as ''"Bairro Beirut"'' (Beirut neighborhood).

By the [[1950s]], this older section had become run down and known as the Second District. As a large part of its main commercial houses had transferred to the city's First District, on the left bank of the river, following the construction there of the main public offices and residences of the most important families. Today, Rio Branco is seeking to find ways to reinvent itself, through relations with neighboring countries, developing heritage and eco-tourism, building on the local fish farming industry, and so on.

== Geography ==
Rio Branco is located at 9° 58' 29" south and 67° 48' 36" west, at an altitude of {{convert|143|m|ft}} above sea level. The city has developed on both sides of the [[Acre River]], with areas known as the First (left bank) and Second Districts. The river is crossed by six bridges, the newest bridge being the Joaquim Macedo Catwalk.

Rio Branco is located in the [[Mesoregion (Brazil)|mesoregion]] of Vale do Jurua and the [[Microregion (Brazil)|microregion]] of Rio Branco. It is bordered on the north by the municipalities of [[Bujari]] and [[Porto Acre]]; to the south by the municipalities of [[Xapuri]], [[Capixaba, Acre|Capixaba]], and [[Plácido de Castro, Acre|Plácido de Castro]]; to the east by the municipality of [[Senador Guiomard]]; and to the west by the municipality of [[Sena Madureira]].

The [[Amazon rainforest]] represents over half of the planet's remaining [[rainforest]]s and comprises the largest and most species-rich tract of [[tropical rainforest]] in the world. Wet tropical forests are the most species-rich [[biome]], and tropical forests in the Americas are consistently more species rich than the wet forests in Africa and Asia.<ref name="Turner 2001">Turner, I.M. 2001.

== Economy ==

{{Wide image|RioBranco(RBR).jpg|600px|1st District of Rio Branco, a historically neglected region, which, over time, became the part of the city where the commerce  concentrates the most. On the left, the south part of Rio Branco, a region linked to the [[ring road]] of the city (Via Verde) which has the presence of large enterprises such as; shopping malls, [[wholesale]] stores, government agencies, universities, soccer stadiums, convention centers, parks, etc. On the right, one can see the neighborhoods of Bosque, Estação Experimental, Jardim Europa, Abraão Alab, Cerâmica, Downtown Rio Branco among others.}}

Historically, the economy of Rio Branco has been based on the extraction of [[Natural rubber|rubber]] and [[brazil nut]]s. Currently, [[wood]] is the main product of export in the state. It is also a major producer of [[Açaí palm|açaí fruit]], [[copaiba]] oil and meat. Rio Branco is currently undergoing a transformation in its economy; transformation that includes an expansion to [[Agribusiness]], [[Aquaculture]] and [[Ecotourism]]. Brazil's largest oil and gas company [[Petrobras]], says the region has potential for future [[extraction of petroleum]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://petrobras.com.br/fatos-e-dados/blocos-na-bacia-do-acre-e-exploracao-de-gas-de-xisto-respostas-a-folha-de-s-paulo.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200623165842/https://petrobras.com.br/fatos-e-dados/blocos-na-bacia-do-acre-e-exploracao-de-gas-de-xisto-respostas-a-folha-de-s-paulo.htm |archive-date=2020-06-23 |title=Petrobras - Fatos e Dados - Blocos na Bacia do Acre e exploração de gás de xisto: respostas à Folha de S.

=== Transportation ===
[[File:Acre rio Branco (137).jpg|thumb|The Terminal Urbano bus station is located in the city centre.]]

[[File:Rio Branco(RBR)2.jpg|thumb|The Via Verde Ring Road is the city's [[ring road]] and it connects the main highways that reach Rio Branco, which are; the [[BR-364]] and the [[Interoceanic Highway]]. In it, one can also find the [[:pt:Via Verde Shopping|Via Verde Mall]] - one of the city's shopping malls - important hospitals, schools, hotels and the [[:pt:Rodoviária Internacional de Rio Branco|Rio Branco International Bus Station]].]]

The public transport system has improved in recent years, mainly due to the construction of the Terminal Urbano  (Urban Bus Terminal) near the center of town. However, the buses are still delayed. Taxis, including motorcycle taxis, are widely used by the population.
