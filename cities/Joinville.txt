'''Joinville''' ({{IPA|pt|ʒoĩˈvil⁽ʲ⁾i|-|Br-Joinville.ogg}}) is the largest [[city]] in [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], in the [[Southern Brazil|Southern Region]] of [[Brazil]]. It is the third largest municipality in the southern region of Brazil, after the much larger state capitals of [[Curitiba]] and [[Porto Alegre]]. Joinville is also a major industrial, financial and commerce center.

The city has a very high human development index (0.809) among Brazilian municipalities, occupying the 21st national position. One study pointed to Joinville as the second best city to live in Brazil.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://anoticia.clicrbs.com.br/sc/noticia/2015/10/joinville-e-a-2-melhor-cidade-do-brasil-para-se-viver-aponta-pesquisa-4865472.html|title=Joinville é a 2ª melhor cidade do Brasil para se viver, aponta pesquisa|access-date=2016-06-16|publisher=A Notícia|archive-date=12 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612120419/http://anoticia.clicrbs.com.br/sc/noticia/2015/10/joinville-e-a-2-melhor-cidade-do-brasil-para-se-viver-aponta-pesquisa-4865472.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Joinville holds the titles of "Brazilian Manchester", "City of Flowers", "City of the Princes", "City of Bicycles" and "City of Dance". It is known for hosting the Joinville Dance Festival (considered the largest dance festival in the world), as well as for having the only branch of the [[Bolshoi Ballet|Bolshoi Ballet School]] outside [[Russia]] in the world.

In 2020, the population of Joinville was estimated at 597,658 people, many of whom are of Portuguese, German, Swiss, Norwegian and Italian descent. The metropolitan area is home to 1,340,997 residents according to the 2010 census by [[IBGE]], making it the most populous metropolitan region of the state of Santa Catarina.<ref name="radarsul.com.br">[http://www.radarsul.com.br/joinville/historia.asp (( Radar Sul )) História da Cidade de Joinville - Santa Catatina - SC - Brasil<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410112859/http://radarsul.com.br/joinville/historia.asp |date=2008-04-10 }}</ref>

Owing to urban development and relatively good infrastructure, Joinville has become a major center for events and business conferences. The city has one of the highest [[standard of living|standards of living]] in Latin America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belasantacatarina.com.br/noticias.asp?id=1791|title=- Bela Santa Catarina - Portal de turismo e negócios|website=www.belasantacatarina.com.br}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Quote box |width=20em |align=left |title=Historical affiliations|fontsize=90% |quote={{flag|Empire of Brazil}} 1851&ndash;1889<br />{{flagicon|Brazil}} [[Brazil|Republic of Brazil]] 1889&ndash;present}}
[[File:Colônia Dona Francisca (1866).jpg|thumb|left|''Dona Francisca'' (1886). German colony in Joinville during the reign of Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]] ]]
The area surrounding Joinville had been inhabited by the [[Guarani people]] for approximately 7,000 years.<ref>Lund, Fredrik Larsen (2017). ''Norske utposter''. Vega forlag. Page 158. {{ISBN|978-82-8211-537-7}}.</ref>

Even though it is considered a [[German Brazilians|German-Brazilian]] city, its origins are [[French language|French]]: the area of Joinville was the ''Colônia Dona Francisca'', designated as the dowry to be given to the future husband of [[Princess Francisca of Brazil]], sister of Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]]. In 1843, Francisca married [[François d'Orléans, Prince of Joinville|François d'Orléans, Prince de Joinville]], son of [[Monarch|King]] [[Louis Philippe I|Louis-Philippe of France]], making him the owner of the lands.

In 1851, after the fall of the French monarchy, the French prince negotiated the use of part of his Brazilian lands with [[Germans|German]] [[Senate of Hamburg|Senator]] [[Christian Mathias Schröder|Mathias Schröder]], founder of the ''Colonization Society of Hamburg''. This society, made up of bankers, businessmen and merchants, attracted Northern European immigrants to travel to colonize Brazil and establish European communities there. In 1851, the first 118 [[German Brazilian|German]] and [[Swiss Brazilian|Swiss]] immigrants arrived in the Brazilian Joinville, followed by 74 [[Norwegian Brazilians|Norwegian immigrants]]. A Royal Palace was built in the city for the prince and princess of Joinville.

From 1851 to 1888, the city of Joinville received 17,000 German immigrants.<ref name="radarsul.com.br" />

===Founding===
[[File:Fachwerkhaus joinville.jpg|thumb|The half-timbered house is an inheritance of the Germanic colonization.]]
The city of Joinville was founded by German, Norwegian,<ref>Sæther, Steinar A. (2015). ''Expectations Unfulfilled: Norwegian Migrants in Latin America, 1820-1940''. BRILL. Page 57. {{ISBN|9789004307391}}.</ref> Swiss settlers on 9 March 1851.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/et-norsk-strandhugg-i-brasil/65464320|title=Et norsk strandhugg i Brasil|date=23 June 1998}}</ref> Immigrants from [[Norway]] made up a group of men with several professional qualifications, including carpenters, masons, bakers, agriculturalists, and even a veterinarian and physician.<ref>Sæther, Steinar A. (2015). ''Expectations Unfulfilled: Norwegian Migrants in Latin America, 1820-1940''. BRILL. Page 61. {{ISBN|9789004307391}}.</ref> Many of the first Norwegian settlers became ill by dysentery, typhoid, and other illnesses. In the first letter home, dated to July 1851, the author explained that "only" four Norwegians were dead so far: Simon Hansen of [[Helgeland]], Lars C. Steensem of [[Ytterøy]], Hans Petter Luttersen of [[Horten]], and Martin Nordby of [[Larvik]]. Between 1851 and 1852, 41 Norwegians left Joinville and seven died.<ref>Lund, Fredrik Larsen (2017). ''Norske utposter''. Vega forlag. Page 185. {{ISBN|978-82-8211-537-7}}.</ref>

A monument was erected by [[Cachoeira River (Joinville)|Rio Cachoeira]] in the city centre in 2001, in honor of the Norwegian, Swiss, and German settlers.<ref>Lund, Fredrik Larsen (2017). ''Norske utposter''. Vega forlag. Page 201. {{ISBN|978-82-8211-537-7}}.</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:João Ervilha .jpg|thumb|A storm over Joinville]]
Joinville is located in the northeast of the state of Santa Catarina, close to the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]], and is crossed by the river [[Cachoeira River (Joinville)|Cachoeira]]. It is not far from the border with the state of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] and its capital, [[Curitiba]]. The city is surrounded by the municipalities of [[Garuva]], [[São Francisco do Sul]], [[Araquari]], [[Guaramirim]], [[Schroeder (Santa Catarina)|Schroeder]], [[Jaraguá do Sul]] and [[Campo Alegre, Santa Catarina|Campo Alegre]] (this one in the [[Microregion (Brazil)|microregion]] of [[São Bento do Sul (microregion)|São Bento do Sul]]).

The city contains a port on [[Babitonga Bay]] (Baía da Babitonga), which leads to the Atlantic Ocean and provides an important route for exporting manufactured products.<ref>{{citation |author=Sergio Silva|year=2006 |title=PROPOSTA DE MOÇÃO |url=http://www.mma.gov.br/port/conama/processos/385B74B3/PropMocao_ImplementUC-BaiaBabitonga-SC_GovSC.pdf|access-date=2016-05-11}}</ref>
In 2006–07 there were public discussions about creating a [[Baía da Babitonga Wildlife Reserve]] to manage the mangroves, fishery and aquaculture in the bay.<ref>{{citation|title=Instituto Chico Mendes e Ibama realizam Consulta Pública para a criação da primeira Reserva de Fauna do País, na baía da Babitonga-SC|author=Sandra Tavares|publisher=[[ICMBio]]|location=Brasília|date=18 September 2007|url=http://www.rbma.org.br/mercadomataatlantica/noticia_2007_09_16.asp|access-date=2016-05-11|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530204047/http://www.rbma.org.br/mercadomataatlantica/noticia_2007_09_16.asp|archive-date=30 May 2016}}</ref>
This was defeated by politicians and businesspeople who were concerned about the impact on planned projects including a port expansion.<ref>{{citation|title=UC – unidade de conservação de fauna|language=pt |author=Gert Roland Fischer|date=22 June 2012|work=Ecologia em Ação |url=http://www.ecologiaemacao.com/2012/06/unidade-de-conservacao-de-fauna.html|access-date=2016-05-11}}</ref>

===Climate===
Joinville has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]] data). In some rare cases, Joinville gets hit by South Atlantic cyclones, the most notable being [[Cyclone Catarina]] in 2004. Although Joinville lies outside the tropic zone, because of its low altitude and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, it sees relatively little temperature variation throughout the year, with every month seeing average highs in the 20s&nbsp;C.
