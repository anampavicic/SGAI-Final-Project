'''Gloucester''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-gloucester.ogg|ˈ|ɡ|l|ɒ|s|t|ər}} {{respell|GLOS|tər}}) is a [[cathedral city]] and the [[county town]] of [[Gloucestershire]] in the [[South West England|South West of England]]. Gloucester lies on the [[River Severn]], between the [[Cotswolds]] to the east and the [[Forest of Dean]] to the west; it is sited {{convert|19|mi}} from [[Monmouth]], {{convert|33|mi}} from [[Bristol]], and {{convert|17|mi}} east of the [[England and Wales border|border]] with [[Wales]]. Gloucester has a population of around 132,000, including suburban areas. It is a port, linked via the [[Gloucester and Sharpness Canal]] to the [[Severn Estuary]].

Gloucester was founded by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and became an important city and ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colony]]'' in AD 97, under [[Nerva|Emperor Nerva]] as ''[[Glevum|Colonia Glevum Nervensis]]''.

It was granted its first charter in 1155 by [[Henry II of England|Henry&nbsp;II]]. In 1216, [[Henry III of England|Henry&nbsp;III]], aged only nine years, was crowned with a gilded iron ring in the Chapter House of Gloucester Cathedral. Gloucester's significance in the Middle Ages is underlined by the fact that it had a number of monastic establishments, including St Peter's Abbey, founded in 679 (later [[Gloucester Cathedral]]); the nearby [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], founded in the 880s or 890s; and [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]], founded in 1136. The town is also the site of the [[siege of Gloucester]] in 1643, during which the city held out against Royalist forces in the [[First English Civil War]].

A major attraction of the city is [[Gloucester Cathedral]], which is the burial place of [[Edward II of England|King Edward II]] and [[Walter de Lacy (died 1085)|Walter de Lacy]]; it features in scenes from the ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter]]'' films. Other features of interest include the museum and school of art and science, the former [[HM Prison Gloucester|county jail]] (on the site of a [[Saxon people|Saxon]] and [[Norman architecture|Norman]] castle), the Shire Hall (now headquarters of the [[Gloucestershire County Council|County Council]]) and the Whitefield memorial church. A park in the south of the city contains a spa, a [[chalybeate]] spring having been discovered in 1814.

Economically, the city is dominated by the service industries and has strong financial, research, distribution and light industrial sectors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gloucester.gov.uk/Content.aspx?urn=497|title=The Economy in Gloucester|work=Gloucester City Council|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814042812/http://www.gloucester.gov.uk/Content.aspx?URN=497|archive-date=14 August 2007|access-date=20 February 2014}}</ref> Historically, it was prominent in the [[aerospace]] industry.

In 1926, the [[Gloucestershire Volunteer Artillery|Gloucestershire]] Aircraft Company at [[Brockworth]] changed its name to the [[Gloster Aircraft Company]] because international customers claimed that the name ''Gloucestershire'' was too difficult to spell. A sculpture in the city centre celebrates Gloucester's aviation history and its involvement in the [[jet engine]].

==Toponymy==
From the city's Roman name, ''[[Glevum]]'', [[Anglo-Saxon]] migrants after 410, with their fledgling feudal structure, the [[Kingdom of Wessex]], replaced the area's Romano-Celtic society and changed the city's name to ''Caerloyw'' ({{IPA|cy|kaɨrˈlɔɨʊ, kairˈlɔiʊ|IPA}}),<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Gloucester |url=http://www.corse.org.uk/history-of-gloucester/ |publisher=CORSE |access-date=3 May 2021 |archive-date=3 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210503115723/http://www.corse.org.uk/history-of-gloucester/ |url-status=unfit }}</ref> Gloucester's name in modern [[Welsh Language|Welsh]], while recognising the presence of the Roman fort. ''Caerloyw'' is a compound of ''caer'', meaning 'fort, stronghold, castle', and ''loyw'', a [[Colloquial Welsh morphology#Soft mutation|lenition]] of ''gloyw'' as it would have been pronounced by many speakers, meaning 'bright, shiny, glowy'.

A variant of the term ''[[Chester (placename element)|-cester/chester/caster]]'' instead of the Welsh ''[[caer]]'' was eventually adopted. The name Gloucester thus means roughly "bright fort". Mediaeval orthographies include ''Caer Glow'', ''Gleawecastre'' and ''Gleucestre''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ekwall|first=Eilert|authorlink=Eilert Ekwall|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names|year=1960|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-869103-7|page=199}}</ref>

This etymology was first suggested by the Austrian philologist, Alfred Holder, in 1896. An alternative etymology has been proposed, which argues that the first element of the place-name is related to a Welsh word signifying 'valiant', rendering 'Gloucester' to mean 'fortress of the valiant'.<ref>John Walter Taylor, [https://archive.org/details/dumbleton-and-the-celtic-substrate//page/23/mode/2up "Dumbleton and the Celtic Substrate"] (Dublin, 2022)</ref>

==History==
===Roman Gloucester===
{{See also|Glevum}}

Glevum was established around AD 48 at an important crossing of the River Severn and near to the [[Fosse Way]], the early front line after the Roman invasion of Britain. Initially, a Roman fort was established at present-day Kingsholm. Twenty years later, a larger legionary fortress was built on slightly higher ground nearby, centred on present-day Gloucester Cross, and a civilian settlement grew around it. Probably the Roman Legion [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix|XX Valeria Victrix]] was based here until 66 and then [[Legio II Augusta]]<ref>G Webster, Rome against Caractacus, p 45, {{isbn|978-0415239875}}</ref> as they prepared to invade Roman Wales between 66 and 74 AD, who stayed later until around 87.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |url=http://www.gadarg.org.uk/essays/e001.htm |title=GADARG – Essay 1 |access-date=2013-06-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927074540/http://www.gadarg.org.uk/essays/e001.htm |archive-date=2011-09-27 }} The colonia of Glevum</ref>

Gloucester became a ''[[Colonia (Roman)|Colonia]]'' in 97 as ''Colonia Nervia Glevensium'', or ''Glevum'', in the reign of [[Nerva]]. It is likely that Glevum became the provincial capital of [[Britannia Prima]].<ref name="auto"/>

Within about 15 years new privately constructed properties replaced the earlier barracks and public buildings, temples and bath houses were under construction in stone. Piped water began to be supplied. Drains and sewers were laid. On the site of the legionary ''principia'' an imposing central ''[[Forum (Roman)|forum]]'' was laid out surrounded by colonnades and flanked on three sides by part-timbered ranges of shops. Closing off the south of the forum was the 100m x 40m [[Basilica]]. Many fine homes with [[mosaic]] floors were built in the town.

At its height, Glevum may have had a population of as many as 10,000 people. The entire area around Glevum was intensely Romanised in the second and third centuries with a higher than normal distribution of villas.

At the end of the third century or the start of the fourth, major changes were made to the city's second-century wall. It was replaced in two stages by a stronger and higher one of stone resting on massive reused stone blocks. In the second stage, the blocks rested on deep timber foundation piles. Stone external towers were added; two parallel wide ditches were also cut in front of the new walls.

Remains of the Roman city can still be seen:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cotswoldarchaeology.co.uk/community/discover-the-past/archaeology-in-your-area/gloscat/|title=Excavating Roman Gloucester|access-date=14 October 2020|archive-date=23 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200923133508/https://cotswoldarchaeology.co.uk/community/discover-the-past/archaeology-in-your-area/gloscat/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gloucesterarchaeologicalpublications.co.uk/|title=Gloucester Archaeological Publications|website=Gloucester Archaeological Publications|access-date=14 October 2020|archive-date=16 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201016032419/https://www.gloucesterarchaeologicalpublications.co.uk/|url-status=live}}</ref>

*Northgate, Southgate, Eastgate and Westgate Streets all follow the line of their original Roman counterparts, although Westgate Street has moved slightly north and Southgate Street now extends through the site of the Roman basilica.

===Post-Roman Gloucester===

{{See also|Roman withdrawal from Britain|Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Heptarchy|Kingdom of England}}
Withdrawal of all Roman forces and many societal leaders in about the year 410 may have allowed leading families of the [[Dobunni]] tribe to regain power within the now Roman-influenced, interconnected and intermixed Celtic Brythonic local people. This intermix is reflected by the fact a large minority of basic words and available synonyms in Welsh have a Latin base. In the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' Gloucester is shown as part of [[Wessex]] from the [[Battle of Deorham]] in 577. At some point afterwards, along with the rest of its shire excluding the [[Forest of Dean]], Gloucester was part of the minor kingdom of the [[Hwicce]]. In 628, as a result of the [[Battle of Cirencester]], that kingdom became a client or sub-kingdom of [[Mercia]]. From about 780, the Hwicce was no longer feigning any pretence as a kingdom and became part of [[Mercia]]. Mercia, allied by matrimony and sharing a desire to counter the Danish onslaught as had conquered swathes of the wider island at large, submitted to [[Alfred the Great]]'s [[Kingdom of Wessex]] in about 877–883. A 20th-century writer intuitively adds that Roman stem Gleu- Glev- was, doubtless, pronounced without any final consonant.<ref>Kenneth Cameron: ''English Place Names''</ref> ''Claudia Castra'' is mentioned in the 18th century as a possible Latin name related to the city.<ref name="Claudia">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rzZLAAAAcAAJ&q=Claudia+Castra&pg=RA3-PA15 | title=Thesaurus Linguae Latinae Compendiarius | publisher=Mount, 1752 – 802 pages | author=Robert Ainsworth | year=1752 | access-date=13 February 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923133100/https://books.google.ie/books?id=rzZLAAAAcAAJ&pg=RA3-PA15&lpg=RA3-PA15&dq=Claudia+Castra&source=bl&ots=XmY1akd68l&sig=8_4DyXQUfe3ibPQmaer360A2-AI&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Claudia%20Castra&f=false | archive-date=23 September 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref>

The first bridging point on a navigable, defensive barrier, great river and the foundation in 681 of the abbey of St Peter by [[Æthelred of Mercia]], favoured town growth; and before the [[Norman conquest of England]], Gloucester was a borough governed by a [[sheriff|portreeve]], with a castle which was frequently a royal residence, and a mint. In the early 10th century, the remains of [[Oswald of Northumbria|Saint Oswald]] were brought to a small church here and shrine built there, a draw for pilgrims. The core street layout is thought to date to the reign of [[Æthelflæd]] in late Saxon times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/glos/vol4/pp5-12|title=Anglo-Saxon Gloucester: c.680 – 1066|work=british-history.ac.uk|access-date=22 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222220156/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/glos/vol4/pp5-12|archive-date=22 February 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1051, [[Edward the Confessor]] held court at Gloucester and was threatened there by an army led by [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex]], but the incident resulted in a standoff rather than a battle.

===Middle ages===
After the Norman Conquest, [[William Rufus]] made [[Robert Fitzhamon]] the first baron or overlord of Gloucester. Fitzhamon had a military base at [[Cardiff Castle]], and for the succeeding years the history of Gloucester was closely linked to that of Cardiff.
<!--<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-17027300 |title='Unique' 11th Century coin discovered near Gloucester |publisher=BBC Gloucestershire |date=16 February 2012 |access-date=20 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426211434/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-17027300 |archive-date=26 April 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>-->

During [[the Anarchy]], Gloucester was a centre of support for the [[Empress Matilda]],<ref>Gesta Stephani, §47</ref> who was supported in her claim to the throne by her half-brother, Fitzhamon's grandson, [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester]] (also known as Robert of Gloucester). After this period of strife ended with the ascent of her son Henry to the throne [[Henry II of England]], Henry granted Robert possession of [[Cardiff Castle]], and it later passed to [[William Fitz Robert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester]] son of Robert. The story of the Anarchy is vividly told in a series of 19th-century paintings by [[William Burges]] at the Castle.

Henry granted Gloucester its first charter in 1155, which gave the burgesses the same liberties as the citizens of London and [[Winchester]]. A second charter of Henry&nbsp;II gave them freedom of passage on the [[River Severn]]. The first charter was confirmed in 1194 by [[Richard I of England|King Richard&nbsp;I]]. The privileges of the borough were greatly extended by the charter of [[John of England|King John]] (1200), which gave freedom from toll throughout the kingdom and from pleading outside the borough.

In 1216, [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]], aged only ten years, was crowned with a gilded iron ring in the Chapter House of [[Gloucester Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/city/glos.html|title=Short History of the City of Gloucester, Gloucestershire|access-date=4 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902133048/http://www.britannia.com/history/city/glos.html|archive-date=2 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> During his reign, [[Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany]] his cousin was briefly imprisoned at Gloucester Castle as state prisoner from 1222 to 1223, and from 1237 to 1238, in addition to sometime during the reign of King John.<ref>Seabourne, Gwen.

Gloucester's significance in the Middle Ages is underlined by the fact that it had a number of monastic establishments, including St Peter's Abbey founded in 679 (later [[Gloucester Cathedral]]), the nearby [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester]] founded in the 880s or 890s, Llanthony Secunda Priory, founded 1136 as a retreat for a community of Welsh monks (now near the western bypass),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.llanthonysecunda.org/|title=Llanthony Secunda Priory|access-date=4 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416012846/http://www.llanthonysecunda.org/|archive-date=16 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> the Franciscan Greyfriars community founded in 1231 (near [[Eastgate Shopping Centre, Gloucester|Eastgate Shopping Centre]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/greyfriars/history/|title=History of Greyfriars – English Heritage|access-date=4 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817110921/http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/greyfriars/history/|archive-date=17 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> and the Dominican Blackfriars community founded in 1239 (Ladybellegate Street).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gloucesterblackfriars.co.uk/ |title=Blackfriars Priory |work=Gloucesterblackfriars.co.uk |access-date=5 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190114161600/http://www.gloucesterblackfriars.co.uk/ |archive-date=14 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> It also has some very early churches including [[St Mary de Lode Church, Gloucester]] near the Cathedral and the Norman [[St Mary de Crypt Church, Gloucester]] in [[Southgate Street]].

The Jews of the town were falsely accused by the Dominican monks of murdering a child, [[Harold of Gloucester]], in an attempt to establish a cult similar to that of [[William of Norwich]], which failed entirely. Nevertheless, the accusations were recycled around the time of the [[Edict of Expulsion]]. In January 1275, [[Eleanor of Provence]] expelled Jews from all of the towns within her dower lands, and the Jews of Gloucester were ordered to move to [[Bristol]] but finding an especially difficult situation there, relocated to [[Hereford]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hillaby |first1=Joe |last2=Hillaby |first2=Caroline |title=The Palgrave Dictionary of Medieval Anglo-Jewish History |year=2013 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Basingstoke |isbn=9780230278165 |ol= OL28086241M |pages=143–4, 147–53}}</ref>

[[File:Gloucester Cathedral Exterior.jpg|thumb|[[Gloucester Cathedral]] housed the Parliament between 1378 and 1406.]] In the [[Middle Ages]], the main export was wool, which came from the [[Cotswolds]] and was processed in Gloucester; other exports included [[leather]] and [[iron]] (tools and weapons). Gloucester also had a large fishing industry at that time.

In 1222, a massive fire destroyed part of Gloucester.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/loc.ark:/13960/t3806c15s|title=The history and description of the city of Gloucester, from the earliest period to the present time|last=Counsel|first=George Worrall|year=1829|location=Gloucester|pages=21|publisher=Printed for J.

One of the most significant periods in Gloucester's history began in 1378 when [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] convened Parliament in the city. Parliaments were held there until 1406 under [[Henry&nbsp;IV of England]]. The Parliament Rooms at the Cathedral remain as testimony to this important time.

Gloucester was incorporated by [[Richard III of England|King Richard III]] in 1483, the town being made a [[county corporate|county]] in itself.

Gloucester was the site of the execution by burning of [[John Hooper (bishop)|John Hooper]], Bishop of Gloucester, in the time of [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]] in 1555. In 1580, Gloucester was awarded the status of a [[port]] by Queen Elizabeth I.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/gloucestershire/content/articles/2005/07/04/coast05walks_stage3.shtml|title=Point 3 – Gloucester Quay|work=BBC News|date=28 October 2014|access-date=30 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161212122900/http://www.bbc.co.uk/gloucestershire/content/articles/2005/07/04/coast05walks_stage3.shtml|archive-date=12 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

The 16th and 17th centuries saw the foundation of two of Gloucester's grammar schools: [[the Crypt School]] in 1539 and [[Sir Thomas Rich's School]] in 1666. Both still flourish as grammar schools today, along with [[Ribston Hall High School|Ribston Hall]] and [[Denmark Road High School]].

During the [[English Civil War]], the fall of nearby Bristol encouraged the reinforcement of the existing town defences. The [[siege of Gloucester]] commenced in 1643 in which the besieged parliamentarians emerged victorious. The Royalist's plan of bombardment and tunnelling to the east gate failed due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery and the besieged sniping and conducting artillery fire on the Royalist encampment.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Day |first=Jon |url= |title=Gloucester and Newbury, 1643: The Turning Point of the Civil War |publisher=Pen & Sword Military |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-84415-591-0 |location=Barnsley |pages=65–66, 107–109, 136–140 |language=en |oclc=137313537}}</ref>

By the mid-17th century, only the gatehouse and keep of [[Gloucester Castle]] remained, the latter of which was being used as a gaol until it was deemed unsuitable and demolished in the late 1780s.

During the Second World War, two petroleum storage depots were constructed in Gloucester. A Government Civil Storage depot with six 4,000-ton semi-buried tanks was constructed on the [[Gloucester and Sharpness Canal|Berkeley Canal]] in 1941/42 by [[Shell-Mex and BP]] and connected to the pipeline that ran from the Mersey to the Avon. It was also connected to the Air Force Reserve Depot and a Shell Mex and BP facility for road and rail loading. Due to severe tank corrosion, it was demolished in 1971/2 and disposed of in 1976. The second depot was an Air Force Reserve Depot with four 4,000-ton semi-buried tanks constructed in 1941/42 by Shell, Shell-Mex and BP at the Monk Meadow Dock on the Canal. Originally, delivery was by road, rail and barge and pipeline. It was also connected to the docks and to the Shell Mex and BP installation for rail and road loading facilities and the civil storage site. It was transferred from the Air Ministry to the Ministry of Power in 1959, closed in the 1990s and disposed of in the later 2000s.<ref>Whittle, Tim: ''Fuelling the Wars – PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 1936 to 2015'', 2017, {{ISBN|9780992855468}}, p. 213.</ref>

Gloucester's most important citizens include [[Robert Raikes]] (founder of the [[Sunday School]] movement) who is still commemorated by the name of [[Robert Raikes' House]] in Southgate Street. Its most infamous citizen was [[Fred West]].

In [[2007 United Kingdom Floods|July 2007]], Gloucester was hit badly by a [[Summer 2007 United Kingdom floods#Gloucestershire|flood]] that struck Gloucestershire and its surrounding areas. Hundreds of homes were flooded, but the event was most memorable because of its wider impact&nbsp;– about 40,000 people were without power for 24 hours, and the entire city (plus surrounding areas) was without piped water for 17 days.

In 2009, [[Gloucester Day]] was revived as an annual day of celebration of Gloucester's history and culture. The day originally dates from the lifting of the Siege of Gloucester in 1643, during which the city held out against Royalist forces during the [[First English Civil War]].<ref name=bbc1>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm "Tradition revived for city pride"], BBC News, 5 September 2009.

Gloucester is one of the few cities in England with two coats of arms. The first consists of three chevrons surrounded by ten roundels. The chevrons come from the arms of the [[de Clare|Clare family]], who were earls of Gloucester from the 12th to the 14th centuries, while the roundels come from the arms of the [[Bishop of Worcester]], whose bishopric historically encompassed Gloucester. This coat is the older of the two, though it is usually termed the "Commonwealth coat", as it was not officially granted to the city until 1652, during the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] period. The crest and supporters (lions bearing broadswords and trowels) were also adopted at this time, along with the motto ''Fides Invicta Triumphat'' ("unconquered faith triumphs", in reference to the royalist siege withstood by the city in 1643).

The second coat, termed the "Tudor coat", was granted in 1538. It features the roses of York and Lancaster, the boar's head of Richard&nbsp;III, a ceremonial sword and cap, and two horseshoes surrounded by nails, to represent Gloucester's historical association with ironworking.

Although grants made by Commonwealth [[herald of arms|heralds]] were nullified after the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]], the Commonwealth coat continued to be used by the city rather than the Tudor coat. The Commonwealth coat, along with the crest and supporters, was legally granted to the city by letters patent dated 16 April 1945. This was reconfirmed in 1974 following the local government changes of that year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gloucester City Council|publisher=Civic Heraldry of England and Wales|url=http://civicheraldry.co.uk/severn_valley_marches.html#gloucester%20city|access-date=22 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304190610/http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/severn_valley_marches.html#gloucester%20city|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=A History of the County of Gloucester|publisher=Victoria County History|location=London|editor-first=N.

==Governance==
{{main|Gloucester City Council}}
There are two tiers of local government covering Gloucester, at district (city) and county level: [[Gloucester City Council]] and [[Gloucestershire County Council]]. The [[Quedgeley]] area of the city is a [[civil parish]] with a town council, forming a third tier of local government; the remainder of the city is an [[unparished area]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Election Mpas |url=https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/election-maps/gb/ |publisher=Ordnance Survey |access-date=28 August 2023}}</ref>

===History===
Gloucester was an [[ancient borough]], being treated as a borough from [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Saxon]] times and being granted its first known borough charter by [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] in 1155. In 1483 the town of Gloucester was given the right to appoint its own magistrates, making it a [[county corporate]], administratively independent from the surrounding county of [[Gloucestershire]]. When the [[Diocese of Gloucester]] was founded in 1541, the town was given the right to call itself a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]]. The city was reformed to become a [[municipal borough]] in 1836 under the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]. When elected county councils were established in 1889, Gloucester was considered large enough to provide its own county-level services, and so it was made a [[county borough]], independent from Gloucestershire County Council.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Herbert |first1=N.

[[File:North Warehouse - geograph.org.uk - 6109086.jpg|thumb|right|North Warehouse]]

[[Gloucester Guildhall]] at 23 Eastgate Street was built in 1892 and served as the city's administrative headquarters until 1986, when the council moved to North Warehouse at [[Gloucester Docks]].<ref>{{NHLE|num=1271663|desc=Guildhall, 23 Eastgate Street|accessdate=28 June 2022|fewer-links=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=City Council moves out – to the docks |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/ |access-date=27 June 2022 |work=Gloucester News |date=11 July 1986}}</ref>

On 1 April 1974, the modern [[non-metropolitan district|district]] of Gloucester was formed under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], covering the same area as the abolished County Borough of Gloucester.<ref>{{cite book |title=The English Non-Metropolitan Districts (Definition) Order 1972 (Statutory Instrument 1972 No. 2039) |date=1972 |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |location=London |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1972/2039/made |access-date=28 June 2022}}</ref> The reforms also saw the city become subordinate to Gloucestershire County Council, losing the independence it had held since 1483.

The city is located on the eastern bank of the [[River Severn]], sheltered by the [[Cotswolds]] to the east, while the [[Forest of Dean]] and the [[Malvern Hills AONB|Malvern Hills]] rise to the west and north, respectively. Gloucester is a port, linked via the [[Gloucester and Sharpness Canal]] which runs from Gloucester's docks to the [[Severn Estuary]], allowing larger ships to reach the docks than would be possible on the tidal reaches of the river itself, which go well north of the city to Haw Bridge. The wharfs, warehouses and the docks themselves fell into disrepair until their renovation in the 1980s. They now form a public open space. Some warehouses now house the [[Gloucester Waterways Museum]], others were converted into residential flats, shops and bars. Additionally, the [[Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum]] is located in the Custom House.

Gloucester is made up of a variety of neighbourhoods, some of which correspond to electoral divisions of the City Council.

=== Green belt ===
{{Further|Gloucester and Cheltenham Green Belt}}
The city itself contains no green belt; however, it is bordered to the north east by the green belt in the surrounding Tewkesbury district, helping to maintain local green space, prevent further urban sprawl and unplanned expansion towards [[Cheltenham]] and [[Innsworth]], as well as protecting smaller nearby villages such as [[Churchdown]], [[Badgeworth]], [[Shurdington]], and [[Twigworth]].

== Potential merger of Cheltenham and Gloucester ==
In May 2024, under plans by [[Gloucestershire County Council]], it was reported that there are secret talks to formally merge the conurbations of Cheltenham and Gloucester with each other.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Garcia |first1=Carmelo |date=11 May 2024 |title=Secret plans to 'merge Cheltenham with Gloucester' and create garden towns |url=https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/gloucester-news/secret-plans-merge-gloucester-cheltenham-9276608 |access-date=19 July 2024 |work=Gloucestershire Live |language=en}}</ref> The plans suggest that around ten new [[garden towns]] could be built around the green belt at [[Boddington, Gloucestershire|Boddington]] which if removed would result in the complete merger of both boroughs.

[[File:Gloucester Cathedral exterior front.jpg|thumb|[[Gloucester Cathedral]]]]

[[Gloucester Cathedral]], in the north of the city near the river, originates in the foundation of an abbey dedicated to [[Saint Peter]] in 681. It is the burial place of [[Edward II of England|King Edward II]] and [[Walter de Lacy (died 1085)|Walter de Lacy]]. The cathedral (mainly its cloisters) was used for corridor scenes in the films ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince]]''. The crypt was used for a scene in ''Sherlock Christmas special''.<ref>{{Cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_7230000/newsid_7233600/7233614.stm | publisher= BBC [[Newsround]] | title= Potter filming moves to cathedral | date= 7 February 2008 | access-date= 10 April 2008 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080214231021/http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_7230000/newsid_7233600/7233614.stm | archive-date= 14 February 2008 | url-status= live }}</ref> Attached to the deanery is the [[Normans|Norman]] prior's chapel. In St Mary's Square outside the Abbey gate, the [[Bishop of Gloucester]], Bishop [[John Hooper (bishop)|John Hooper]], was martyred under [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]] in 1555.

A good number of [[medieval]] and [[Tudor period]] gabled and [[half timbered]] houses survive from earlier periods of Gloucester's history. At the point where the four principal streets intersected stood the Tolsey (town hall), which was replaced by a modern building in 1894. None of the old public buildings are left except for the [[The New Inn, Gloucester|New Inn]] in Northgate Street. It is a timbered house, with strong, massive external galleries and courtyards. It was built around 1450 by John Twyning, a monk.<ref name=eh>{{NHLE|num=1245714 |desc=New Inn|access-date= 27 June 2011}}</ref>

[[File:King's Square, Gloucester - geograph.org.uk - 469564.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Kings Square (1976)]]
[[Kings Square, Gloucester|Kings Square]] is at the heart of the city centre and occupies what was once a cattle market and [[Gloucester Transport Hub|bus station]]. Officially opened in 1972, it was the centrepiece of a radical redesign of the city, The Jellicoe Plan, which was first proposed in 1961. It stands beside the Debenham's (formerly Bon Marché) store built in the early 1960s. Many of the features of the redevelopment have since been dismantled; the [[Brutalist architecture|brutalist]] concrete fountains in the middle of the square have gone and the overhead roadways which linked three multi storey car parks around the centre have been either closed or dismantled. The main bus station received a [[Civic Trust Awards|Civic Trust Award]] in 1963 but has since been demolished, with a new bus station being constructed on the same site during 2018. In 2012 a £60 million plan was unveiled to revamp the square.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kings Square £60m revamp signed by developer |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-19742222 |work=BBC News |date=27 September 2012 |access-date=21 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925231719/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-19742222 |archive-date=25 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2014 the prominent Golden Egg restaurant was demolished and a new look public space was created. A prior archaeological dig revealed a Roman house underneath.<ref>{{cite news |title=New dawn for King's Square in Gloucester as Golden Egg piazza finally revealed |url=http://www.gloucestercitizen.co.uk/New-dawn-King-s-Square-Gloucester-Golden-Egg/story-20932709-detail/story.html |work=Gloucester Citizen |date=9 April 2014 |access-date=21 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924040813/http://www.gloucestercitizen.co.uk/New-dawn-King-s-Square-Gloucester-Golden-Egg/story-20932709-detail/story.html |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

An indoor market opened in Eastgate Street in 1968, followed by the Eastgate Shopping Centre in 1973.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Timeline of Gloucester History |url=http://www.localhistories.org/gloucestertime.html |publisher=Local Histories |access-date=19 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720092809/http://localhistories.org/gloucestertime.html |archive-date=20 July 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Kings Walk Shopping Centre, Gloucester|Kings Walk Shopping Centre]] was built between 1969 and 1972.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Verey|first1=David|last2=Brooks|first2=Alan|author-link2=Alan Brooks|date=1970|chapter=The City Centre:3|page=487|title=Gloucestershire:The Vale and the Forest of Dean}}</ref> The corner of Eastgate Street and Brunswick Road was redeveloped around this time; Roman remains unearthed below street level in 1974 may be seen through a glass observation panel outside the Boots building, which opened in 1980. The [[HSBC]] building on the Cross was renovated and a modern extension added to the Westgate Street aspect in 1972 which received a Civic Trust Award. [[Sainsbury's]] opened a supermarket in Northgate Street in 1970; it retains its original interior. Opposite, [[Tesco]] opened a large two-storey supermarket in June 1976 on the site of a demolished chapel. This is now occupied by [[Wilko (retailer)|Wilkinson's]] after Tesco moved to [[Quedgeley]] in 1984. Asda opened its first store in Gloucester in Bruton Way in 1983.

Gloucester Leisure Centre opened on the corner of Eastgate Street and Bruton Way in September 1974 and was redeveloped and rebranded (as "GL1") in August 2002. [[Gloucester Central railway station]] was rebuilt in 1977 to serve both the original traffic to that railway station and the services from the closed [[Gloucester Eastgate railway station]] (former [[Midland Railway]]) which had stood on another site further east along the same road. Opposite the station stands one of the city's largest office blocks, Twyver House, opened in 1968, which houses the regional Land Registry. The main shopping streets were pedestrianised in the late 1980s.

The 1966 ''Heights Plan for Gloucester'' sought to restrict construction of tall buildings and defend spiritual values by protecting views of [[Gloucester Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite book|title="The Landscape of Man", pp356-7|author=[[Geoffrey Jellicoe|Geoffrey]] & [[Susan Jellicoe]] |publisher=pub. Thames & Hudson, 1975}}</ref> The tower of [[Gloucestershire Royal Hospital]], started in 1970 and completed in August 1975, can be seen from miles around. In Brunswick Road, a brown concrete tower, which housed classrooms at the [[Gloucestershire College|Gloucestershire College of Arts and Technology]] (now moved to a site near Llanthony Bridge). The tower was added incongruously to the existing 1930s Technical College buildings in 1971 which has now been demolished. Clapham Court, a tall block of flats, stands in Columbia Close, between London Road and Kingsholm Road. It was built in 1963 and stands on what was once Columbia Street in a small district formerly known as Clapham.

Other features of interest include the museum and school of art and science, the former [[HM Prison Gloucester|county jail]] (on the site of a [[Saxon people|Saxon]] and [[Norman architecture|Norman]] castle), the Shire Hall (now headquarters of the [[Gloucestershire County Council|County Council]]) and the Whitefield memorial church. A park in the south of the city contains a spa, a [[chalybeate]] spring having been discovered in 1814. West of this, across the canal, are the remains (a gateway and some walls) of [[Llanthony Secunda|Llanthony Secunda Priory]], a cell of the [[Llanthony Priory|mother abbey]] in the [[Vale of Ewyas]], [[Monmouthshire]], which in the reign of [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]] became the secondary establishment.

The city's Northgate and Southgate streets feature a series of public art [[mosaic]] panels depicting Gloucester's medieval trades made by artists [[Gary Drostle]] and Rob Turner in 1998 and 1999. Eastgate and Westgate streets feature a series of mosaic panels made by arts group 'The Pioneers'.

[[File:The Guildhall (geograph 3577055).jpg|thumb|right|275px|The architecture of [[Gloucester Guildhall]]]]
The [[Three Choirs Festival]], originating in the 18th century and one of the oldest music festivals in the [[British Isles]], is held in Gloucester every third year, the other venues being [[Hereford]] and [[Worcester, England|Worcester]]. Gloucester hosted the festival in 2019, and it is next due in the city in 2023.

The city's main theatre and cultural venue is the Guildhall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gloucester.gov.uk/guildhall |title=Guildhall |publisher=Gloucester.gov.uk |access-date=17 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212231254/http://www.gloucester.gov.uk/guildhall |archive-date=12 February 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Guildhall hosts a huge amount of entertainment, including live music, dance sessions, a cinema, bar, café, art gallery and much more. The Leisure Centre, GL1, hosts concerts and has a larger capacity than the Guildhall.

The annual Gloucester International [[Rhythm and Blues]] Festival takes place at the end of July and early August.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gloucesterblues.co.uk|title=Gloucester International Rhythm & Blues Festival 2010|access-date=18 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190413075215/http://www.gloucesterblues.co.uk/|archive-date=13 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Gloucester International [[Cajun]] and [[Zydeco]] Festival, the largest in the UK and longest-running in Europe, runs for a weekend in January each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gloucestercajunfestival.co.uk/ |title=Gloucester Cajun and Zydeco Festival |publisher=Gloucester Guildhall |access-date=20 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140212121255/http://www.gloucestercajunfestival.co.uk/ |archive-date=12 February 2014 }}</ref> A Medieval Fayre is held in Westgate Street each year during the summer.

Gloucester is also noted as the home of the Frightmare Halloween Festival, the largest [[Halloween]] festival in the South West.<ref name=FrightmareHeart>{{cite web|title=Frightmare at Over Farm|url=http://www.heart.co.uk/gloucestershire/events/going-out/frightmare-over-farm/|website=Heart Gloucestershire|publisher=Heart|access-date=1 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509121217/http://www.heart.co.uk/gloucestershire/events/going-out/frightmare-over-farm/|archive-date=9 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

The main museum in the city is [[The Museum of Gloucester]] but there are several other important museums.

[[The Tailor of Gloucester]] House which is dedicated to the author [[Beatrix Potter]] can be found near the cathedral.

Since 2013 Gloucester has marked Armed Forces Day with a Drum Head Service held on College Green in the shadow of the cathedral. This is followed by a parade of serving forces, veterans and cadets through the city centre to the docks for a family day with military and military-related charity displays and entertainment in Back Badge Square in front of the Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

[[Nature in Art]] is a gallery dedicated to the display of works of art inspired by the natural world.

The city features in the popular, well-known nursery rhyme (of unknown date and origin) about a [[Doctor Foster (nursery rhyme)|Doctor Foster]], who reportedly visited the city, got wet, and swore to stay away as a result.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

==Churches==
{{Main|List of churches in Gloucestershire}}

Gloucester has many churches, and historically has also had many dissenting chapels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/glos/vol4/pp319-334|title=Gloucester: Protestant nonconformity {{!}} British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk|access-date=2019-01-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007223143/https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/glos/vol4/pp319-334|archive-date=7 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It may have been the old proverb "as sure as God's in Gloucester" that provoked [[Oliver Cromwell]] to declare that the city had "more churches than godliness". Gloucester was the host of the first [[Sunday school]] in England; this was founded by [[Robert Raikes]] in 1780. Four of the churches that are of special interest are
* [[St Mary de Lode Church|St Mary de Lode]]&nbsp;– with a [[Norman architecture|Norman]] tower and [[chancel]], and a monument of Bishop [[John Hooper (bishop)|John Hooper]]. It was built on the site of an ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] temple which became the first Christian church in Britain
* [[St Mary de Crypt Church|St Mary de Crypt]]&nbsp;– with a cruciform structure of the 12th century. It has later additions, such as the tower. Also the site of the Schoolroom in which the [[The Crypt School, Gloucester|Crypt School]] was formed
* [[St Michael's Tower, Gloucester|St Michael's Church]] – said to have been connected with St Peter's ancient abbey
* [[St Nicholas' Church, Gloucester|St Nicholas's Church]] – founded by the [[Normans]] but with many additions since then

In the neighbourhood around St Mary de Crypt there are slight remains of Greyfriars and [[Blackfriars, Gloucester|Blackfriars]] monasteries, and also of the city wall. Under the Golden Fleece (The Monks Bar) and Saracen's Head inns early vaulted cellars still remains. In addition, in the city is [[St Peter's Church, Gloucester|St Peter's Roman Catholic Church]], a Grade II* listed building.<ref>[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-472317-roman-catholic-church-of-st-peter-glouce Roman Catholic Church of St Peter, Gloucester] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305190538/http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-472317-roman-catholic-church-of-st-peter-glouce |date=5 March 2016 }} from British Listed Buildings, retrieved 3 January 2016</ref>

During the construction of the Boots store on the corner of Brunswick Road and Eastgate Street in 1974, Roman remains were found. These can be seen through a glass case on the street. At the back of the Gloucester Furniture Exhibition Centre part of the city's South Gate can be seen.

==Education==
{{See also|List of schools in Gloucestershire}}

There are three endowed schools: the historic [[The King's School, Gloucester|King's School]], refounded by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] as part of the cathedral establishment; the school of [[The Crypt School, Gloucester|St Mary de Crypt]], now known as "[[The Crypt School, Gloucester]]" since it moved to a mile from town centre to Podsmead, founded by Dame Joan Cooke in the same reign (1539); [[Sir Thomas Rich's School]], previously known as ''Sir Thomas Rich's Bluecoat Hospital for Boys'' (1666); the [[High School for Girls]] (1883); and Ribston Hall High School for Girls. Comprehensives include [[Henley Bank High School]], [[Beaufort Co-operative Academy]], [[St Peter's High School, Gloucester|St Peter's High School]] (Catholic school), [[Chosen Hill School]], [[Severn Vale School]], [[Gloucester Academy]], [[Barnwood Park School]] and [[Churchdown School Academy]]. There is a Steiner Waldorf School founded in 1937 with a High School added just after the Second World War.

The city is home to one of three campuses of the [[University of Gloucestershire]], based at Oxstalls, just outside the city centre. The university has also purchased the former Debenhams store in the city centre with a new campus due to open there in 2023. The university also manages student accommodation and halls of residence in the city, with the other campuses based in Cheltenham 7 miles away.

==Transport==
[[File:Gloucester c1798.jpg|thumb|Cargo boats, known as [[trow]]s, navigating under a bridge at Gloucester]]

===Roads===
The [[M5 motorway]], opened in 1971, runs east of the city boundary. Junction 12 serves south Gloucester and Quedgeley; junction 11a serves central Gloucester; and junction 11 serves north Gloucester. The [[A38 road|A38]] runs north–south through Gloucester, connecting the city with [[Tewkesbury]] and Bristol. The [[A40 road|A40]] runs west to east, connecting Gloucester with [[Cheltenham]] to the east (via a dual carriageway section known as ''The Golden Valley Bypass'') and the [[Forest of Dean]] and [[South Wales]] to the West. The [[A46 road|A46]] and [[A4173]] links [[Stroud, Gloucestershire|Stroud]], and the [[A417 road|A417]] links [[Cirencester]] in the south-east and [[Ledbury]] in the north-west. Gloucester has a network of [[Cycling infrastructure|cycle paths]].

Until the construction of the [[Severn Bridge]] in 1966, Gloucester was the lowest road bridging point on the river and hence was an important settlement between [[South Wales]] and the southernmost counties of England including London. The Severn has a small [[anabranch]] here to reach [[Alney Island]] and then the main western bank. [[Over Bridge|A bridge at Over]], built by [[Thomas Telford]] in 1829, still stands, notable for its very flat arch, but its fragility and narrowness means it is disused; since 1974, it has been paralleled by a modern bridge. The [[Gloucester to Newport Line]] railway bridge is close to both, the lowest crossing of the UK's longest river until the [[Severn Railway Bridge]] 1879–1960, which was coupled with the [[Severn Tunnel]] in 1886, the present holder of that status.

===Railway===
[[Gloucester railway station]] is served by several [[train operating companies]]:
* [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]] operates a route between [[Maesteg railway station|Maesteg]], {{stnlnk|Bridgend}}, [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff Central]], {{stnlnk|Chepstow}} and [[Cheltenham Spa railway station|Cheltenham Spa]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Timetables |work=Transport for Wales |date=10 December 2023 |access-date=7 January 2024 |url= https://tfw.wales/service-status/timetables |quote=}}</ref>
* [[CrossCountry]] operates Cardiff Central – [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]] services, via [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street]].<ref>{{Cite web |work=CrossCountry |title=Timetables |date=10 December 2023 |access-date=7 January 2024 |url= https://www.crosscountrytrains.co.uk/travel-updates-information/train-timetables |quote=}}</ref>
* [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]] operates services to [[Paddington railway station|London Paddington]], [[Swindon railway station|Swindon]], [[Westbury railway station|Westbury]], [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol Temple Meads]], Cheltenham, [[Worcester Shrub Hill railway station|Worcester]], [[Great Malvern railway station|Great Malvern]] and [[Weymouth railway station|Weymouth]].<ref>{{Cite web |work=Great Western Railway |title=Train Times |date=10 December 2023 |access-date=7 January 2024 |url= https://www.gwr.com/travel-information/train-times |quote=}}</ref>

Gloucester was the site of the [[Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company]] railway works, which have now closed. A new station at Hunts Grove has been considered on the southern edge of the city near [[Quedgeley]], as part of ''MetroWest'' plans to extend Bristol commuter services to the city.<ref>{{Cite web |work=Bristol Rail Campaign |title=MetroWest plans extended to Gloucester and Westbury |access-date=7 January 2024 |date=25 June 2020 |url=https://bristolrailcampaign.org.uk/metrowest-plans-extended-to-gloucester-and-westbury/ |quote=}}</ref>

===Buses and coaches===
Most local buses are run by [[Stagecoach West]], centred at a depot on London Road, with connections to [[Cheltenham]], [[Stroud]], [[Ross-on-Wye]] and other smaller communities. For many years, there were both stopping and express services to [[Worcester, England|Worcester]] and [[Birmingham]] operated by [[Midland Red]] and later [[Midland Red West]], but this connection was lost due to service reductions. [[National Express Coaches]] operate the 444 route to London.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gloucester Bus Services |work=Bus Times |date=2024 |access-date=7 January 2024 |url= https://bustimes.org/localities/gloucester |quote=}}</ref>

===Canals===
Gloucester is linked to the [[Severn Estuary]] by the [[Gloucester and Sharpness Canal]], which is navigable by small [[Coastal trading vessel|coasters]]. The city is linked to the [[River Avon, Warwickshire|River Avon]] and [[Stourport-on-Severn]] by the navigable part of the [[River Severn]], which is navigable by river craft of a few hundred tonnes' [[Hull (watercraft)|displacement]]. [[Gloucester Docks]] mark the Normal Tidal Limit (NTL) of the river.<ref>{{URL|1=http://getamap.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/getamap/frames.htm?mapAction=gaz&gazName=p&gazString=GLOUCESTER}} ''getamap.ordnancesurvey.co.uk''</ref> Gloucester was formerly linked to [[Ledbury]] and [[Hereford]] by the [[Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal]]; and subsequently by the [[Ledbury and Gloucester Railway]], which used the southern section of the former canal, until it also closed in 1964. This canal is now being restored and the restored canal basin in the adjacent village of Over is a local attraction.

===Air===
[[File:Aerial of Gloucestershire Airport, Gloucestershire, England 24May2017 arp.jpg|thumb|Gloucestershire Airport in 2017, looking east. On the left is the straight [[A40 road]] and at the bottom the [[M5 motorway]]. [[Innsworth]] and Gloucester are at the top.]]

Commercial airports with scheduled services are [[Bristol Airport|Bristol]], [[Birmingham Airport|Birmingham]] and [[Cardiff Airport|Cardiff]] 40–60 miles away; global hub [[Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]] is about 100 miles by road and shares with Gloucester its main rail interchange at London Paddington.

[[Gloucestershire Airport]], sited 8 miles east of the city, is a private and special charters airfield.

==Business and industry==
Gloucester has a long history in the [[aerospace]] business. In 1926 the Gloucestershire Aircraft Company at [[Brockworth]] changed its name to the [[Gloster Aircraft Company]] because international customers claimed that the name "Gloucestershire" was too difficult to spell. A sculpture in the city centre celebrates Gloucester's [[aviation]] history and its involvement in the [[jet engine]]. [[Frank Whittle]]'s pioneering [[Gloster Aircraft Company#1941 – turbojet|turbojet engine]] powered the [[Gloster E.28/39]], the first British jet aircraft, which first flew at the company's airfield at [[Brockworth, Gloucestershire#Gloster Aircraft Company|Brockworth]]. This is commemorated by the pub "The Whittle" at Gloucester Business Park, which now occupies the site. Roads in the business park are named after other Gloster aircraft and a small statue overlooks the site of the old main runway. [[Messier-Dowty]]'s [[landing gear]] plant and [[GE Aviation]] [[Dowty Rotol|Dowty Propellers]] plants are on the outskirts of the city.

The large insurer [[Ecclesiastical Insurance]] is based in the city, as is its owner, the charity [[Benefact Trust]].<ref>{{EW charity|263960|Allchurches Trust}}</ref> [[Lloyds Banking Group]] and [[TSB Bank (United Kingdom)|TSB Bank]] each have an office in [[Barnwood]], the former previously having been the headquarters of [[Cheltenham & Gloucester|Cheltenham & Gloucester Building Society]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Credit Crunch |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/gloucestershire/content/articles/2009/06/09/cheltenham_gloucester_feature.shtml |publisher=BBC |access-date=19 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191222182555/http://www.bbc.co.uk/gloucestershire/content/articles/2009/06/09/cheltenham_gloucester_feature.shtml |archive-date=22 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Gloucester was the home of [[Priday, Metford and Company Limited]], a family milling firm which survived for over one hundred years, and hydraulic engineering firm [[Fielding & Platt]].
