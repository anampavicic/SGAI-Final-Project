It is the headquarters of the [[Uttar Dinajpur district]]. The police station was set up 125 years ago and railway connectivity reached the place 115 years ago.{{when|date=September 2020}} The city houses the 111-year-old [[Raiganj Coronation High School]] and more than 50-years-old government primary Raiganj Sarala Sundari GSFP School.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name "Raiganj" is not exactly known, and is debated. Some say the name is linked to the royal family of Dinajpur whose surname was Rai. The widely accepted view is that the name originated from the abundance of rai sorshe (a special type of mustard) crops at this place from time immemorial.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/once-upon-a-time/story-y2YcMKtTbufxxbbjMsw23J.html | title=Once upon a time | date=13 April 2011 }}</ref> Many people think that the word "Raiganj" came from "Rai" meaning "[[Radha]]", the consort of [[Krishna]]. In this connection, "Kaliaganj", nearest city to Raiganj, comes from "Kalia" meaning "Krishna", the central character of ''[[Mahabharata]]''.

===Raiganj Wildlife Sanctuary===
Raiganj is known for [[Raiganj Wildlife Sanctuary]] (also called the Kulik Bird Sanctuary), home to a large population of [[Asian openbill]]s and other waterbirds and it is the largest bird sanctuary in Asia. Raiganj is situated at the banks of Kulik river which helped the town to become an important place for water connectivity. In course of time, the navigability of Kulik river decreased and business through the waterway was stopped in the first half of the 1970s, especially after the dam was erected to prevent floods. The port area slowly lost its significance and, at present, it is the most backward locality of Raiganj.

===Location===
The area of this town is about 36.51&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. The present growing tendency and trend of urbanisation in the area adjacent to this town are also remarkable. The agglomeration areas are also experiencing this trend. Now the vast areas under Birghai, Maraikura, Rupahar, Bahin, Karnojora, and [[Maharaja Hat]] are also growing with the population like the town of Raiganj, and this population is dependent on Raiganj town.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://indiamapsite.com/west_bengal/raiganj/#&lat=25.613029&lng=88.134519&z=11&mt=hybrid&pls=0 | title=Raiganj map (West Bengal) }}</ref>

[[Rickshaws]], auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws and city autos are the most widely available [[public transport]] in Raiganj. Most residents stay within a few kilometres of the town centre and have their own vehicles, mostly [[motorcycle]]s and [[bicycles]].

[[Raiganj railway station]] is on the [[Katihar-Siliguri Line|Barsoi-Radhikapur branch line]]. Railway connectivity reached here more than 150 years ago but, due to Indo-Bangladesh partition in 1971 the links through Bangladesh were lost and the railway became only a branch line.

[[National Highway 34 (India)|NH 34]] passes through Raiganj which connects is to the capital of the state [[Kolkata]]. Conversion of the highway to four lanes is going on and the proposed highway will bypass Raiganj by about 6&nbsp;km. The roadway connectivity suffers due to the traffic jam caused at [[Dalkhola]] on a regular basis. Raiganj also lacks in railway connectivity because the station is on a branch line. In the 1960s, the broad gauge line was shifted to Malda-Barsoi-Dalkhola, thus bypassing Raiganj.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raiganjonline.in/city-guide/transport-in-raiganj|title = Transport in Raiganj, Bus Services in Raiganj, Raiganj Railways}}</ref>

==Tourism==

===Raiganj Bird Sanctuary===
Situated along the National Highway and by the side of the Kulik river is the [[Raiganj Wildlife Sanctuary]] with an area of 35 acres and a buffer area of 286 acres. The forest and water bodies attract migratory birds like the open bill stork, night heron, cormorant, little cormorant and egret from South Asian countries and coastal regions. Local birds like dove, bulbul, sparrow, kingfisher, woodpecker, owl, duck and cuckoo, can also be seen in large numbers.

The migratory birds arrive from the end of May to the first week of July, and depart from mid-December to the end of January. The nesting time is from July to August, and egg laying from August to September. The flying training to the young ones is the best time to observe the birds, around October to November. Every winter nearly 150 different bird species arrive here from the north in numbers ranging from 65,000 to 75,000.

The sanctuary has an artificial network of man made canals which is connected to the River Kulik. During the months of monsoon the flood water from the river enters the plains of the sanctuary. This acts as an important source of food for most of the bird species.

'''Legal status of the forest:'''

There are a total of 400 existing beds for patients in different wards of Raiganj district hospital. However, there was no infrastructure for the treatment of dying patients and the patients who suffer from complicated diseases of the kidney and heart. Hence, on most occasions, complicated patients are transferred either to North Bengal Medical College & Hospital in Siliguri or Malda medical college and even to Kolkata which is 444&nbsp;km away. The patient parties are facing great crisis to shift their patients either to Siliguri or Malda. Sometimes, patients die on the way as a result of complexities.

On 27 November, the state Chief Minister [[Mamata Banerjee]] during her visit to Raiganj announced that Raiganj District Hospital would be upgraded to a super specialty hospital and to start new Raiganj Medical College & Hospital in 2018.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}
