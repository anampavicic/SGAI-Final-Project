The [[House of Lancaster]] was a branch of the [[List of English monarchs|English royal family]]. The [[Duchy of Lancaster]] still holds large estates on behalf of [[Charles III]], who is the [[Duke of Lancaster]]. The [[Port of Lancaster]] and the 18th-century [[Lancaster slave trade]] played a major role in the city's growth, but for many years the [[outport]] of [[Glasson Dock]], downstream, has been the main shipping facility.

{{see also|History of Lancashire}}
===Toponymy===
Lancaster was recorded in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of 1086, as ''Loncastre'', where "Lon" refers to the [[River Lune]] and "castre" from the [[Old English]] ''cæster'' and [[Latin]] ''castrum'' for "fort" to the [[Roman empire|Roman]] fort that stood on the site.<ref>Eilert Ekwall, 'The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Placenames' (1960), 4th edition, p. 285.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Lancaster |url=https://opendomesday.org/place/SD4861/lancaster/ |website=opendomesday.org |publisher=Domesday Book |access-date=28 July 2023}}</ref>

[[File:Roman bath house, Lancaster 2.JPG|thumb|Roman bath house on Castle Hill]]
[[Lancaster Roman Fort|A Roman fort]] was built by the end of the 1st century CE on the hill where [[Lancaster Castle]] now stands, possibly as early as the 60s, based on Roman coin evidence.<ref>Shotter, p. 5.</ref><ref>I.

Roman baths were found in 1812 and can be seen near the junction of Bridge Lane and Church Street. There was presumably a bath-house with the 4th-century fort. The Roman baths incorporated a reused inscription of the Gallic Emperor [[Postumus]], dating from 262 to 266. The 3rd-century fort was garrisoned by the ''ala Sebosiana'' and ''numerus Barcariorum Tigrisiensium''.<ref>Birley, CW- XXXIX, p. 222. {{full citation needed|date=October 2020}}</ref>

The ancient ''Wery Wall'' was identified in 1950 as the north wall of the 4th-century fort, which was a drastic remodelling of the 3rd-century one, while retaining the same orientation. The later fort is the only example in north-west Britain of a 4th-century type, with massive curtain-wall and projecting bastions typical of the ''Saxon Shore'' or Wales. Extension of the technique as far north as Lancaster shows that the coast between Cumberland and North Wales was not left defenceless after the west-coast attacks and the disaster in the [[Carausian Revolt]] of 296, which followed from those under [[Clodius Albinus|Albinus]] in 197.

Little is known of Lancaster from the end of Roman rule to the early 5th century and the Norman Conquest of the late 11th century. Despite a lack of documentation for the period, it is thought that Lancaster remained inhabited. It lay on the fringes of the kingdoms of [[Mercia]] and [[Northumbria]] and over time may have passed from one to the other.<ref>{{harvnb |White |2001 |p=33}}</ref> Archaeological evidence suggests there was a monastery on or near the site of today's [[Lancaster Priory]] by the 700s or 800s. The Anglo-Saxon [[Runes|runic]] "Cynibald's cross" found at the Priory in 1807 is thought to date from the late 9th century. Lancaster was probably one of several abbeys founded under [[Wilfrid]].<ref>White, p. 34.</ref>

===Medieval===
[[File:Lancaster in 1728.jpg|thumb|Lancaster in 1728]]
After the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066, Lancaster fell under the control of [[William the Conqueror|William I]], as stated in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, which has the earliest known mention of Lancaster as such in any document. The founding Priory charter dated 1094 is the first known document specific to Lancaster.<ref name="White 57">White, p. 57.</ref> By this time William had passed Lancaster and its surroundings to [[Roger the Poitevin|Roger de Poitou]]. The document also suggests the monastery was refounded as a parish church some time before 1066.<ref name="White 57"/>

Lancaster became a [[Ancient borough|borough]] in 1193 under [[Richard I of England|King Richard I]]. Its first [[Municipal charter|charter]], dated 12 June 1193, was from [[John, King of England|John]], [[List of counts of Mortain|Count of Mortain]], who later became King of England.<ref>White, p. 35.</ref>
[[File:DV342 Lancaster from the south.png|thumb|Lancaster from the south in 1825]]
[[Lancaster Castle]], partly built in the 13th century and enlarged by [[Elizabeth I]], stands on the site of a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[garrison]]. During [[The Great Raid of 1322]], damage was done to the castle by [[Robert the Bruce]], though it resisted the attack and was restored and strengthened by [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]], who added much of the Gateway Tower and a turret on the keep or Lungess Tower, which has been named "John o' Gaunt's Chair".<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Lancaster |volume=16 |pages=148–149 |inline=1}}</ref> In 1322 the Scots burnt the town. It was rebuilt but removed from its position on the hill to the slope and foot. Again in 1389, after the [[Battle of Otterburn]], it was destroyed by the Scots.<ref name=EB1911/> Lancaster Castle is known as the site of the [[Pendle witch trials]] in 1612. It was said that the court based in the castle (the Lancaster [[Assizes]]) sentenced more people to be [[hanging|hanged]] than any other in the country outside [[London]], earning Lancaster the nickname, ''"the Hanging Town"''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/lancast.html |title=Lancaster Castle |website=www.capitalpunishmentuk.org |access-date=24 July 2010 |archive-date=8 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408134330/http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/lancast.html |url-status=live}}</ref> It also figured prominently in the suppression of Catholicism during the Reformation – at least eleven Catholic priests were executed and a memorial to them as the [[Lancaster Martyrs]] stands by the city centre.

[[File:Lancaster from Lune Bank, Skerton.jpg|thumb|Lancaster in the 19th century]]
The traditional emblem of the [[House of Lancaster]] is the [[Red Rose of Lancaster]], similar to that of the [[House of York]] with a white rose. The names derive from emblems of the Royal Duchies of [[Duchy of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[Duke of York|York]] in the 15th century. This erupted into a [[civil war]] over rival claims to the throne during the [[Wars of the Roses]].

More recently the term ''"Wars of the Roses"'' has been applied to rivalry in sports between teams from [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]]. It is also applied to the annual [[Roses Tournament]] between Lancaster and York universities.<ref>Students celebrate...{{Cite web |url=http://www.thenationalstudent.co.uk/2010/05/04/students-celebrate-as-lancaster-triumphs-in-war-of-the-roses/ |title=STUDENTS CELEBRATE AS LANCASTER TRIUMPHS IN WAR OF THE ROSES &#124; the National Student |access-date=24 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810202750/http://www.thenationalstudent.co.uk/2010/05/04/students-celebrate-as-lancaster-triumphs-in-war-of-the-roses/ |archive-date=10 August 2010}}</ref>

In the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century, the city council was under the control of the [[Morecambe Bay Independents]] (MBIs), who campaigned for an independent Morecambe council. In 2003, their influence waned and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] became the largest party on the council. They formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats and Greens. At the May 2007 local elections, Labour lost ground to the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green]]s in Lancaster and the MBIs in Morecambe, resulting in [[no overall control]], with all parties represented in a PR administration. The 2011 elections saw Labour emerge as the largest party. They reached a joint administrative arrangement with the Greens.{{cn|date=July 2023}}

==Geography==

===Music===
{{more citations needed section|date=October 2016}}

The city's semi-professional [[Haffner Orchestra]] has a reputation for classical music. It performs in the Ashton Hall in the city centre and at Lancaster University.

During parades and festivals it is common to see two other long standing musical groups perform, Lancaster City Brass, which is the oldest remaining brass band in the city celebrating its 75th anniversary in 2021 and Batala who recently completed 15 years of Samba Regge drumming.

Lancaster has been producing successful bands and musicians since the 1990s, notably the drummer [[Keith Baxter (drummer)|Keith Baxter]] of [[3 Colours Red]] and folk-metal band Skyclad, who also featured Lancaster guitarist Dave Pugh, and the thrash metal band D.A.M., who were all from Lancaster, recording two albums for the Noise International label, with Dave Pugh appearing on the second.

The all-girl punk-rock band [[Angelica (band)|Angelica]] used the Lancaster Musicians' Co-operative, the main rehearsal and recording studio in the area.

The city has also produced many other musicians, including singer and songwriter [[John Waite]], who first became known as lead singer of [[The Babys]] and had a solo #1 hit in the US, "[[Missing You (John Waite song)|Missing You]]". As part of the band [[Bad English]], John Waite also had a #1 hit in the Billboard top hundred in the 1970s called "[[When I See You Smile]]". Additionally, Paul James, better known as The Rev, former guitarist of English punk band [[Towers of London (band)|Towers of London]] who is now in the band [[Day 21]] and plays guitar live on tour for [[The Prodigy]]; [[Chris Acland]], drummer of the early 1990s shoegaze band [[Lush (band)|Lush]]; Tom English, drummer of North East indie band [[Maxïmo Park]] and [[Steve Kemp (musician)|Steve Kemp]], drummer of the indie band [[Hard-Fi]].

Lancaster continues to produce bands and musicians such as singer-songwriter [[Jay Diggins]], and acts like [[The Lovely Eggs]], receiving considerable national radio play and press coverage in recent years. More recently, Lancaster locals [[Massive Wagons]] signed to Nottingham-based independent label [[Earache Records]]. The city is also the founding home of the dance-music sound systems Rhythm Method and ACME Bass Company.
