Auckland lies between the [[Hauraki Gulf]] to the east, the [[Hunua Ranges]] to the south-east, the [[Manukau Harbour]] to the south-west, and the [[Waitākere Ranges]] and smaller ranges to the west and north-west. The surrounding hills are covered in [[rainforest]] and the landscape is dotted with 53 volcanic centres that make up the [[Auckland Volcanic Field]]. The central part of the urban area occupies a narrow [[isthmus]] between the Manukau Harbour on the [[Tasman Sea]] and the [[Waitematā Harbour]] on the Pacific Ocean. Auckland is one of the few cities in the world to have a harbour on each of two separate major bodies of water.

The [[Auckland isthmus]] was first settled {{circa|1350}} and was valued for its rich and fertile land. The [[Māori people|Māori]] population in the area is estimated to have peaked at 20,000 before the arrival of Europeans.<ref name="Hochstetter18672">{{Cite book |author=Ferdinand von Hochstetter |url=http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document/1867_-_von_Hochstetter%2C_Ferdinand._New_Zealand/CHAPTER_XI%3A_The_Isthmus_of_Auckland |title=New Zealand |year=1867 |page=243 |author-link=Ferdinand von Hochstetter |access-date=19 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112062218/http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document/1867_-_von_Hochstetter%2C_Ferdinand._New_Zealand/CHAPTER_XI%3A_The_Isthmus_of_Auckland |archive-date=12 January 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> After a [[Colony of New Zealand|British colony]] was established in New Zealand in 1840, [[William Hobson]], then Lieutenant-Governor of New Zealand, chose Auckland as its new [[Capital of New Zealand|capital]]. [[Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei]] made a strategic gift of land to Hobson for the new capital. Hobson named the area after [[George Eden, Earl of Auckland]], British [[First Lord of the Admiralty]]. Māori–European conflict over land in the region led to war in the mid-19th century. In 1865, Auckland was replaced by [[Wellington]] as the capital, but continued to grow, initially because of its port and the logging and gold-mining activities in its hinterland, and later because of pastoral farming (especially dairy farming) in the surrounding area, and manufacturing in the city itself.<ref>Margaret McClure, Auckland region, http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/auckland-region {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105032116/http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/auckland-region|date=5 November 2013 }}</ref> It has been the nation's largest city throughout most of its history. Today, [[Auckland CBD|Auckland's central business district]] is New Zealand's leading economic hub.

The [[University of Auckland]], founded in 1883, is the largest university in New Zealand. The city's significant tourist attractions include national historic sites, festivals, performing arts, sports activities and a variety of cultural institutions, such as the [[Auckland War Memorial Museum]], the [[Museum of Transport and Technology]], and the [[Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki]].

In response to the ongoing rebellion by [[Hōne Heke]] in the mid-1840s, the government encouraged retired but fit British soldiers and their families to migrate to Auckland to form a defence line around the port settlement as garrison soldiers. By the time the first [[Fencibles]] arrived in 1848, the [[Flagstaff War|Northern War]] had concluded. Outlying defensive towns were then constructed to the south, stretching in a line from the port village of [[Onehunga]] in the west to [[Howick, New Zealand|Howick]] in the east. Each of the four settlements had about 800 settlers; the men were fully armed in case of emergency, but spent nearly all their time breaking in the land and establishing roads.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

In the early 1860s, Auckland became a base against the [[Māori King Movement]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/treaty/the-treaty-in-practice/slide-to-war |title=Slide to war - The Treaty in practice &#124; NZHistory, New Zealand history online |publisher=Nzhistory.net.nz |access-date=20 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024182015/http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/treaty/the-treaty-in-practice/slide-to-war |archive-date=24 October 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the 12,000 Imperial soldiers stationed there led to a strong boost to local commerce.<ref name="Essay Vincent"/> This, and [[Great South Road, New Zealand|continued road building towards the south]] into the [[Waikato]] region, enabled [[Pākehā]] (European New Zealanders) influence to spread from Auckland.

The growth occurred similarly to other [[Commerce|mercantile]]-dominated cities, mainly around the port and with problems of overcrowding and pollution. Auckland's population of ex-soldiers was far greater than that of other settlements: about 50 per cent of the population was Irish, which contrasted heavily with the majority English settlers in Wellington, [[Christchurch]] or [[New Plymouth]]. The majority of settlers in the early period were assisted by receiving cheap passage to New Zealand.<ref>{{cite AV media |title=The Aotearoa History Show Episode 4 - Te Tiriti o Waitangi |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xc7GySsFuA |date=14 October 2019 |access-date=13 April 2024 |publisher=YouTube, [[Radio New Zealand|RNZ]] & [[NZ on Air]] |time=4:50 to 5:10 |archive-date=8 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240408203400/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xc7GySsFuA |url-status=live }}</ref>

Trams and railway lines shaped Auckland's rapid expansion in the early first half of the 20th century. However, after the Second World War, the city's transport system and urban form became increasingly dominated by the motor vehicle.{{cn|date=June 2024}} Arterial roads and motorways became both defining and geographically dividing features of the urban landscape. They also allowed further massive expansion that resulted in the growth of suburban areas such as the [[North Shore, New Zealand|North Shore]] (especially after the construction of the [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]] in the late 1950s), and [[Manukau City]] in the south.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Plan 2050 |first=Auckland |title=What Manakau will look like in the future |url=https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/plans-projects-policies-reports-bylaws/our-plans-strategies/auckland-plan/development-strategy/future-auckland/Pages/what-manukau-look-like-future.aspx |website=aucklandcouncil.govt.nz |access-date=17 November 2021 |archive-date=17 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211117014449/https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/plans-projects-policies-reports-bylaws/our-plans-strategies/auckland-plan/development-strategy/future-auckland/Pages/what-manukau-look-like-future.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref>

Economic deregulation in the mid-1980s led to very dramatic changes to Auckland's economy, and many companies relocated their head offices from Wellington to Auckland. The region was now the nerve centre of the entire national economy. Auckland also benefited from a surge in tourism, which brought 75 per cent of New Zealand's international visitors through its airport. Auckland's port handled 31 per cent of the country's container trade in 2015.<ref name="teara.govt.nz">{{cite web |title=Auckland Region – Driving the Economy: 1980s Onwards |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/auckland-region/page-11 |publisher=Te Ara, Encyclopedia of New Zealand |access-date=3 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031003507/http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/auckland-region/page-11 |archive-date=31 October 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The face of urban Auckland changed when the government's immigration policy began allowing immigrants from Asia in 1986. This has led to Auckland becoming a multicultural city, with people of all ethnic backgrounds. According to the 1961 census data, Māori and Pacific Islanders comprised 5 per cent of Auckland's population; Asians less than 1 per cent.<ref>"[http://auckland.royalcommission.govt.nz/web/part2/2_auckland_now.html Auckland Now] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120708105508/http://auckland.royalcommission.govt.nz/web/part2/2_auckland_now.html |date=8 July 2012 }}". Royal Commission on Auckland Governance.</ref> By 2006, the Asian population had reached 18.0 per cent in Auckland, and 36.2 per cent in the central city.

The Auckland Volcanic Field is considered to be a [[monogenetic volcanic field]], with each volcano erupting only a single time, usually over a timeframe of weeks to years before cessation of activity.<ref name="Hayward (2019)" /> Future eruptive activity remains a threat to the city, and will likely occur at a new, unknown location within the field.<ref name="Hopkins et al (2020)" /> The most recent activity occurred approximately 1450 AD at the [[Rangitoto Island|Rangitoto Volcano]].<ref name="Hopkins et al (2020)" /> This event was witnessed by [[Māori people|Māori]] occupants of the area, making it the only eruption within the Auckland Volcanic Field thus far to have been observed by humans.

The Auckland Volcanic Field has contributed greatly to the growth and prosperity of the Auckland Region since the area was settled by humans. Initially, the [[maunga]] (scoria cones) were occupied and established as [[pā]] (fortified settlements) by Māori due to the strategic advantage their elevation provided in controlling resources and key [[portages]] between the [[Waitematā Harbour|Waitematā]] and [[Manukau Harbour|Manukau]] harbours.<ref name="Hayward (2019)" /> The rich volcanic soils found in these areas also proved ideal for the cultivation of crops, such as [[Sweet potato #Oceania|kūmara]]. Following European arrival, many of the maunga were transformed into quarries to supply the growing city with aggregate and building materials, and as a result were severely damaged or entirely destroyed.<ref name="Hayward (2019)" /> A number of the smaller maar craters and tuff rings were also removed during earthworks. Most of the remaining volcanic centres are now preserved within recreational reserves administered by [[Auckland Council]], the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]], and the [[Tūpuna Maunga o Tāmaki Makaurau|Tūpuna Maunga o Tāmaki Makaurau Authority]].

[[List of ethnic origins of New Zealanders|Many ethnic groups]], since the late 20th century, have had an increasing presence in Auckland, making it by far the country's most [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] city. Historically, Auckland's population has been of majority [[European New Zealanders|European]] origin, though the proportion of those of Asian or other non-European origins has increased in recent decades due to the [[Immigration to New Zealand|removal of restrictions directly or indirectly based on race]]. Europeans continue to make up the plurality of the city's population, but no longer constitute a majority after decreasing in proportion from 54.6% to 48.1% between the 2013 and 2018 censuses. [[Asian New Zealanders|Asians]] now form the second-largest ethnic group, making up nearly one-third of the population. Auckland is home to the largest ethnic [[Polynesia]]n population of any city in the world, with a sizeable population of [[Pacific Islander]]s ([[Pasifika New Zealanders|Pasifika]]) and indigenous [[Māori people]].<ref name="AAAROUND"/><ref name=":02">{{Cite web |title=Age and sex by ethnic group (grouped total response), for census usually resident population counts, 2006, 2013, and 2018 Censuses (urban rural areas) |url=http://nzdotstat.stats.govt.nz/wbos/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TABLECODE8318 |access-date=13 September 2020 |website=nzdotstat.stats.govt.nz |archive-date=9 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201009205114/http://nzdotstat.stats.govt.nz/wbos/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TABLECODE8318 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Immigration to New Zealand is heavily concentrated towards Auckland (partly for job market reasons). This strong focus on Auckland has led the immigration services to award extra points towards immigration visa requirements for people intending to move to other parts of New Zealand.<ref>[http://www.immigration.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/4DAD508D-CC26-425A-A57B-D2AF557C8510/0/1003.pdf Residence in New Zealand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614211315/http://www.immigration.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/4DAD508D-CC26-425A-A57B-D2AF557C8510/0/1003.pdf |date=14 June 2007 }} (Page 8, from the [[Immigration New Zealand]] website.

Housing varies considerably between some suburbs having [[State housing in New Zealand|state owned housing]] in the lower income neighbourhoods, to palatial waterfront estates, especially in areas close to the [[Waitematā Harbour]]. Traditionally, the most common residence of Aucklanders was a standalone dwelling on a '[[quarter acre]]' (1,000 m<sup>2</sup>).<ref name="ARCGRO"/> However, subdividing such properties with 'infill housing' has long been the norm.

In the lead-up to 2010, a housing crisis began in Auckland, with the market not being able to sustain the demand for affordable homes. The Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas Act 2013 mandated that a minimum of 10 percent of new builds in certain housing areas be subsidised to make them affordable for buyers who had incomes on par with the national average.

The [[New Zealand state highway network|State Highway network]] connects the different parts of Auckland, with [[State Highway 1 (New Zealand)|State Highway 1]] being the major north–south thoroughfare through the city (including both the [[Auckland Northern Motorway|Northern]] and [[Auckland Southern Motorway|Southern Motorways]]) and the main connection to the adjoining regions of [[Northland Region|Northland]] and [[Waikato]]. The [[Northern Busway, Auckland|Northern Busway]] runs alongside part of the Northern Motorway on the North Shore. Other state highways within Auckland include [[New Zealand State Highway 16|State Highway 16]] (the Northwest Motorway), [[New Zealand State Highway 18|State Highway 18]] (the Upper Harbour Motorway) and [[New Zealand State Highway 20|State Highway 20]] (the Southwest Motorway). [[New Zealand State Highway 22|State Highway 22]] is a non-motorway rural arterial connecting [[Pukekohe]] to the Southern Motorway at [[Drury, New Zealand|Drury]].<ref name="Waka Kotahi">{{cite web |title=Map List {{!}} Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency |url=https://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/overdimen-veh-route-maps/2-state-highways/map-list.html |website=www.nzta.govt.nz |access-date=12 August 2020 |archive-date=6 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206080223/http://nzta.govt.nz/resources/overdimen-veh-route-maps/2-state-highways/map-list.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The [[Central Motorway Junction]], also called 'Spaghetti Junction' for its complexity, is the intersection between the two major motorways of Auckland (State Highway 1 and State Highway 16).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fonseka |first1=Dileepa |title=Spaghetti junction stadium: Is motorway jungle best fit for Auckland? |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/104495373/spaghetti-junction-stadium-is-motorway-jungle-best-fit-for-auckland |access-date=12 August 2020 |work=Stuff |date=6 June 2018 |language=en |archive-date=4 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210704010525/https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/104495373/spaghetti-junction-stadium-is-motorway-jungle-best-fit-for-auckland |url-status=live }}</ref>

Two of the longest arterial roads within the Auckland Region are [[Great North Road, New Zealand|Great North Road]] and [[Great South Road, New Zealand|Great South Road]] – the main connections in those directions before the construction of the State Highway network.<ref name="Waka Kotahi"/> Numerous arterial roads also provide regional and sub-regional connectivity, with many of these roads (especially on the isthmus) previously used to operate Auckland's [[Trams in New Zealand#Auckland|former tram network]].

Auckland has four railway lines ([[Western Line (Auckland)|Western]], [[Onehunga Line|Onehunga]], [[Eastern Line (Auckland)|Eastern]] and [[Southern Line (Auckland)|Southern]]). These lines serve the western, southern and eastern parts of Auckland from the [[Britomart Transport Centre|Waitematā railway station]] in downtown Auckland, the terminal station for all lines, where connections are also available to ferry and bus services. Work began in late 2015 to provide more route flexibility and connect Britomart, now named Waitematā, more directly to the western suburbs on the Western Line via an underground rail tunnel known as the [[City Rail Link]] project. A [[Light rail in Auckland|light rail network]] is also planned.
