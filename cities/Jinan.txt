== Names ==
The modern-day name ''Jinan'' literally means "south of the Ji" and refers to the old [[Ji River]] (濟水) that had flowed to the north of the city until the middle of the 19th century. The Ji River disappeared in 1852<ref name="pletcher2011">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tfVN0Gwx67YC&pg=PA170|title=The Geography of China|date=August 15, 2010|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |isbn=9781615301348|access-date=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323172554/https://books.google.com/books?id=tfVN0Gwx67YC&pg=PA170|archive-date=March 23, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> when the [[Yellow River]] changed its course northwards and took over its bed. The current pronunciation of the character "Ji" with the third tone (''jǐ'') was established in the late 1970s. Prior to this, it was pronounced with the fourth tone (''jì''). Older western texts spell the name as "Tsinan" ([[Chinese postal romanization|Postal]] romanization) or "Chi-nan" ([[Wade-Giles]] romanization).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

During the times of the [[Zhou dynasty]] (1045 BC to 256 BC), the city of Lixia ({{zh|s={{linktext|历|下}}|t={{linktext|歷|下}}|hp=Lìxià}}) was the major settlement in the area. The name "Lixia" refers to the location of Jinan at the foot of Mount Li, which lies to the south of the city. Today, Lixia is the name of one of the city's districts.

The [[Battle of An]], which was fought in the area during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (in 589 BCE) between the states of [[Qi (state)|Qi]] and [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]], is named for the ancient city of An ({{zh|c={{linktext|鞍}}|p=Ān|links=no}}) which stood within the city limits of present-day Jinan. [[Marco Polo]] gives a brief description of Jinan under the name "Chingli"<ref name="eb">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Jinan|title=Jinan|publisher=Britannica.com|access-date=February 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307213315/https://www.britannica.com/place/Jinan|archive-date=March 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> or "Chinangli".<ref name="polo">The Travels of Marco Polo – The Complete Yule-Cordier Edition, Volume II</ref> 19th and early 20th century texts frequently give the name of the city as "Tsinan Fu" where the additional "Fu" ({{zh|c=府|links=no}}) comes from the dated Chinese term for a provincial capital ({{zh|c={{linktext|省|府}}|links=no}}).

Jinan is also referred to by the nickname "City of Springs" ({{zh|c={{linktext|泉|城}}|links=no}}), because of the many artesian springs in the urban city centre and its surroundings.<ref name="spr" />

==History==
===Early history===
The area of present-day Jinan has been inhabited for more than 4000 years. The [[Neolithic]] [[Longshan culture]] was first discovered at [[Chengziya]] to the east of Jinan ([[Zhangqiu District]]) in 1928. One of the characteristic features of the Longshan culture are the intricate wheel-made pottery pieces it produced. Most renowned is the black "egg-shell pottery" with wall thicknesses that can go below 1 millimeter.<ref name="twmus">[http://digital.nmh.gov.tw/collection/pda/en/30145.htm Neolithic Painted Pottery, National Museum of History, Taipeh]</ref>

During the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (722–481 BCE) and [[Warring States period]] (475–221 BCE), the area of Jinan was split between two states: the [[state of Lu]] in the west and the [[state of Qi]] in the east. In 685 BCE, the state of Qi started to build the [[Great Wall of Qi]] across Changqing county. Portions of the wall still remain today and are accessible as open air museums. [[Bian Que]], according to the legend the earliest Chinese physician and active around 400–300 BCE, is said to have been a native of present-day Changqing County. [[Zou Yan]] (305–240 BCE), a native of [[Zhangqiu City]], developed the concepts of [[Yin-Yang]] and the [[Wuxing (Chinese philosophy)|Five Elements]]. [[Joseph Needham]], a British [[sinologist]], describes Zou as "The real founder of all Chinese scientific thought."<ref name=Needham>Needham, Joseph. 1978.

During the times of the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE – 220 CE), Jinan was the capital of the feudatory [[Kingdom of Jibei]] ({{zh|t={{linktext|濟|北|國}}}}) and evolved into the cultural and economic hub of the region.

Beginning in the 5th century CE, [[Buddhism]] flourished in Jinan. The Langgong Temple ({{zh|labels=no |c={{linktext|朗|公|寺}} |p=Lǎnggōng Sì}}, later renamed Shentong Temple, ({{zh|labels=no |c={{linktext|神|通|寺}} |p=Shéntōng Sì}}, and now in ruins) in the southern county of Licheng was one of the most important temples in northern China at that time. The same period witnessed extensive construction of Buddhist sites in the southern counties of [[Licheng District, Jinan|Licheng]] and [[Changqing District|Changqing]] such as the [[Lingyan Temple (Jinan)|Lingyan Temple]] and the [[Thousand-Buddha Cliff]]. In particular, a large number of cave temples were established in the hills south of Jinan.<ref name="eb"/>

Jinan remained the cultural center of the region during the [[Song dynasty]] (960 – 1279 CE). The Song rulers promoted Jinan to a superior prefecture in 1116 CE. Two of the most important poets of the [[Southern Song]] were both born in Jinan: [[Li Qingzhao]] (1084–1151 CE), the most renown female poet in Chinese history, and [[Xin Qiji]] (1140–1207 CE), who was also a military leader of the Southern Song dynasty. Both poets witnessed [[Jin campaigns against the Song dynasty|a series of crushing defeats]] of the Song dynasty at the hands of the [[Jurchens]] who gained control over almost half of the Song territories and established the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] in northern China. After Jinan came under control of the Jin dynasty, both Li Qingzhao and Xin Qiji had to abandon their homes and reflected this experience in their works.
[[File:老濟南城.jpg|thumb|Old town of Jinan]]
During the Civil War that followed the proclamation of [[Kublai Khan]] as [[Great Khan]] in 1260 CE, Jinan was at the center of a rebellion by Yizhou governor Li Tan against Mongol rule in 1262 CE. The rebellion was crushed in a decisive battle that was fought not far from Jinan in late March or early April 1262 CE. After losing 4000 of his troops in the battle, Li Tan retreated to Jinan to make his last stand.

Despite such violent conflicts, culture in Jinan continued to thrive during the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] (1115–1234) and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] (1271–1368) dynasties: One of the most renowned artists of the Yuan dynasty, [[Zhao Mengfu]] (1254–1322) was appointed to the post of governor of Jinan in 1293 and spent three years in the city. Among the extraordinary art works he completed during his stay in Jinan, the best known painting is "Autumn Colors on the Qiao and Hua Mountains" ({{zh|labels=no|s=《{{linktext|鹊|华|秋|色}}》}}). Geographer [[Yu Qin]] (1284–1333) also served as an official in Jinan and authored his geography book ''[[Qi Cheng]]'' there.

When [[Shandong]] province was established under the [[Ming dynasty]], Jinan became its capital.<ref name="eb"/> Jinan was the site of a siege during the [[Jingnan Campaign]] where the city was defended by loyalists of the [[Jianwen Emperor]] led by [[Tie Xuan]] against the rebel [[Prince of Yan]] [[Zhu Di]]'s army.

In 1852, the northward shift of the Yellow River into a new bed close to the city triggered the modern expansion of Jinan. The new course of the Yellow River connected the city to the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] and regional waterways in northern Shandong and southern [[Hebei]].<ref name="eb"/>

German influence in Jinan grew after the [[Qing dynasty]] ceded [[Qingdao]] to the German Empire in 1897. A German concession area was established to the west of the historical city center (in the vicinity of the Jinan Railway Station first established by the Germans). The [[Jiaoji Railway|Jiaoji (Qingdao–Jinan) railway]] was built by the Germans against local resistance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Li |first1=Si (李斯)|script-title=zh:1904年06月01日 胶济铁路通车|url=http://www.todayonhistory.com/6/1/jiaojitielutongche.html|website=www.todayonhistory.com|access-date=September 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903061227/http://www.todayonhistory.com/6/1/jiaojitielutongche.html|archive-date=September 3, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Discontent over the construction of the railway was one of the sources fueling the [[Boxer Rebellion]] (1899–1901).<ref name=boxerorigins>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lAxresT12ogC|title=The Origins of the Boxer War|isbn=9780700715633|access-date=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323132421/https://books.google.com/books?id=lAxresT12ogC|archive-date=March 23, 2017|url-status=live|last1=Xiang|first1=Lanxin|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press }}</ref> During the rebellion, foreign priests were evacuated from Jinan and Chinese Christians became a target of violence.

===After World War II===
Japanese troops controlled Jinan until their defeat in 1945. After this, the Kuomintang regained short-lived control of the city during the period from 1946 to 1948. The provincial government during this time was led by Lieutenant-General [[Wang Yaowu]], who also commanded the KMT army in the region. KMT rule over Jinan ended in September 1948 with the [[Battle of Jinan]] in which units of the [[People's Liberation Army]] under the command of [[Chen Yi (communist)|Chen Yi]] took the city. The battle for Jinan took a decisive turn in favor of the attackers when KMT Lieutenant-General [[Wu Huawen]] <!--denoting lifespan of a modern figure is less important than that of an ancient figure--> defected to the Communist side with about 8,000 of his troops.<ref name=time1948_10_04>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,799241,00.html|title=OHINA: Province for a Poet|date=October 4, 1948|work=TIME.com|access-date=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823173912/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,799241,00.html|archive-date=August 23, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The most likely explanation for his defection is that he had been pressured through relatives of his who were held captive by the Communist forces.<ref name="time1948_10_04"/> Lieutenant-General Wu had been in charge of the vital outer ring of defenses that protected the main airfield, the railroad station, and the commercial district.<ref name="time1948_10_04"/> With these critical assets lost, the situation of the city's defenders became untenable.

==Climate==
Jinan has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cwa''), considering an [[contour line#Temperature and related subjects|isotherm]] of −3&nbsp;°C, or a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dwa''), considering an isotherm of 0&nbsp;°C, with four well-defined seasons.

With the shift of the Yellow River to a new bed right to the north of Jinan (in 1852) and the establishment of a railroad hub, the city became a major market for agricultural products from the productive farming regions to the north.<ref name="eb"/>
Following the trade in agricultural goods, the city developed a textile and clothing industry, flour mills, oil presses, as well as factories producing paper, cement, and matches.<ref name="eb"/> In the 1950s, large iron and steel works as well as chemical factories were established around Jinan. The large metal works produce [[pig iron]], [[ingot]] steel, as well as finished steel.<ref name="eb"/> In 2008, steel manufacturing was restructured with the formation of the [[Shandong Iron and Steel Group]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In the 1970s, [[China National Heavy Duty Truck Group|Sinotruk]] established its headquarters and factories for the production of trucks and construction vehicles in the city.<ref>"[http://www.cnhtc.com.cn/en/index2.htm Introduction CNHTC] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508070126/http://www.cnhtc.com.cn/en/index2.htm |date=2008-05-08 }}."

Industrial zones include:
*Jinan High-tech Industrial Development Zone
Founded in 1991, the Jinan High-tech Industrial Development zone was one of the first of its kind approved by the State Council. The zone is located to the east of the city and covers a total planning area of {{convert|83|km2|abbr=on}} that is divided into a central area covering {{convert|33|km2|abbr=on}}, an export processing district of {{convert|10|km2|abbr=on}}, and an eastern extension area of {{convert|40|km2|abbr=on}}. Since its foundation, the Jinan High-tech Industrial Development Zone has attracted enterprises as LG, Panasonic, Volvo, and Sanyo. In 2000, it joined the world science and technology association and set up a China-Ukraine High-tech Cooperation Park. The Qilu Software Park became the sister park of Bangalore park of India.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/jinan-hi-tech-industrial-development-zone/|title=Ji'nan High-tech Industrial Development Zone|access-date=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502061204/http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/jinan-hi-tech-industrial-development-zone|archive-date=May 2, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>
*Jinan Export Processing Zone
The export processing zone is located in the eastern suburbs of Jinan, to the east of the Jinan High-tech Industrial Development Zone and to the north of the Jiwang highway. The distances to the Jiqing Highway and the Jinan Airport are {{convert|9|km|abbr=on}} and {{convert|18|km|abbr=on}} respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/jinan-export-processing-zone/|title=Ji'nan Export Processing Zone|access-date=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310002114/http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/jinan-export-processing-zone|archive-date=March 10, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Demographics==
[[File:The South Mosque of Jinan 2009-03.JPG|upright|The [[Jinan Great Southern Mosque|Great Southern Mosque]], the oldest mosque in Jinan.|thumb|180px]]
As of the [[2020 Chinese census]], its total population (including [[Laiwu City]] merged recently) was 9,202,432 inhabitants and its built-up (''or metro'') area made of 6 out of 10 urban districts ([[Jiyang District, Jinan|Jiyang]], [[Zhangqiu District|Zhangqiu]], [[Laiwu District|Laiwu]] and [[Gangcheng District|Gangcheng]] not yet conurbated) was home to 5,452,335 inhabitants, most of them with Han ethnicity.

==Shopping centers==
Most shopping malls in Jinan are in the downtown area centered around [[Spring City Square|City of Springs Square]] and Quancheng Road ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|泉|城|路}} |l=spring city road}}). City of Springs Square was built by the municipal government beside the city moat in the early 21st century

City of Springs Road was rebuilt at the same time that City of Springs Square was created. The government's intention was to create a modern business district and yet preserve the traditional Chinese culture. Therefore, newly built shopping malls with traditional Chinese architectural styles and modern western skyscrapers can be found side by side along City of Springs Road. Notable retail businesses are Quancheng Bookstore – the largest bookstore of the city – and Walmart (near the western end of City of Springs Road). Major shopping malls along the road are the Guihe Shopping Center ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|贵|和|商|厦}}), the [[Sofitel]] Silver Plaza, the Shimao international shopping center, and the Wanda Shopping Mall ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|万|达|集团}}). Parc 66 ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|济南|恒|隆|广场}}) to the south of City of Springs Road (opposite of [[Water Lily Street]]), opened in August 2011, is Jinan's largest shopping mall with seven levels of retail space and a total gross floor area of 171,000 square meters.<ref name=hanglung>{{cite web|url=http://www.hanglung.com/en/mainland-china-properties/parc-66.aspx|title=Hang Lung – Home|access-date=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122124239/http://www.hanglung.com/en/mainland-china-properties/parc-66.aspx|archive-date=January 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Transportation==

===Railways===
[[File:201908 Jinanxi Railway Station.jpg|thumb|[[Jinan West railway station|Jinan West Railway Station]]]]
Jinan is positioned at the intersection of two major railways: The [[Jinghu Railway]] that runs from [[Beijing]] to [[Shanghai]] is the major north–south backbone of the railway system in eastern China. In Jinan, it intersects with the [[Jiaoji Railway]] that connects Jinan to the sea port of [[Qingdao]] to the east. In addition, the [[Hanji Railway]] connects Jinan to the city of [[Handan]] ([[Hebei]] Province) in the west.
Within Shandong province, the Jinghu Railway connects Jinan with the cities of [[Dezhou]], [[Tai'an]], [[Jining, Shandong|Jining]], and [[Zaozhuang]]; the Jiaoji Railway provides a link to the cities of [[Zibo]], [[Qingdao]], and [[Weifang]]; the Hanji Railway serves the cities of Yancheng and [[Liaocheng]].

Central Jinan is served by [[Jinan railway station]], [[Jinan East railway station]], and [[:zh:大明湖站|Daminghu railway station]] (just by [[Daming Lake]]).

The [[Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway]] calls at [[Jinan West railway station]], which is outside the central metropolitan center and is in suburban western Jinan's [[Huaiyin District, Jinan|Huaiyin District]]. Since it opened for public service on June 30, 2011,<ref name=chinadaily201107>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/shandong/e/2011-07/04/content_12829317.htm|title=Jinan welcomes high-speed rail|access-date=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304100002/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/shandong/e/2011-07/04/content_12829317.htm|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> it has become a future hub with west–east running high speed railways to [[Taiyuan]], [[Shijiazhuang]] and [[Qingdao]].

==Culture and contemporary life==
===Dialect===
{{main|Jinan dialect}}
Local residents in the city proper, as well as in the surrounding areas, have traditionally spoken the [[Jinan dialect]] of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] that is not readily understood even by native speakers of standard Mandarin. The younger people of Jinan are more likely to speak standard Mandarin, whereas many older residents retain strong local dialect elements in their speech. Nevertheless, even the younger residents of Jinan tend to retain a strong local accent and mix local vocabulary into the standardized Mandarin vocabulary. Due to the influx of migrant workers during the past decade of China's economic boom, many of the current population that are of working age are not natives of Jinan but have learned to understand the Jinan dialect.

===Cuisine===
Jinan has its own cuisine, the Jinan style of the [[Shandong cuisine]], one of the [[Cuisine of China|Eight Culinary Traditions]] of China. One of its features is the use of soup in its dishes. Modern cuisines in [[northern China]] —Beijing, Tianjin and the northeastern regions including [[Heilongjiang]], Jilin and [[Liaoning]]— are all branches of Shandong cuisine.

===Shopping centers===
[[File:济南泉城广场的郁金香.jpg|thumb|[[Spring City Square]]]]

Most shopping malls in Jinan are in the downtown area centered around [[Spring City Square]] and Quancheng Road ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|泉|城|路}} |l=spring city road}}). City of Springs Square was built by the municipal government beside the city moat in the early 21st century; at the center is the statue "Spring" which has become a symbol of Jinan. The square borders on the ancient city moat. It has a music fountain, a 46,000 square meter underground shopping center and a memorial hall with statues of famous people from Shandong.

City of Springs Road was rebuilt at the same time that City of Springs Square was created. The government's intention was to create a modern business district and yet preserve the traditional Chinese culture. Therefore, newly built shopping malls with traditional Chinese architectural styles and modern western skyscrapers can be found side by side along City of Springs Road. Notable retail businesses are Quancheng Bookstore – the largest bookstore of the city – and Walmart (near the western end of City of Springs Road). Major shopping malls along the road are the Guihe Shopping Center ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|贵|和|商|厦}}), the [[Sofitel]] Silver Plaza, the Shimao international shopping center, and the Wanda Shopping Mall ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|万|达|集团}}). Parc 66 ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|济南|恒|隆|广场}}) to the south of City of Springs Road (opposite of [[Water Lily Street]]), opened in August 2011, is Jinan's largest shopping mall with seven levels of retail space and a total gross floor area of 171,000 square meters.<ref name=hanglung/>

==Main tourist attractions==
{{Main|List of sites in Jinan}}
[[File:Sacredheartcathedraljinan.jpg|thumb|[[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Jinan)|Sacred Heart Cathedral, Jinan]]]]
Jinan is renowned across China for its numerous springs, the lakes fed by the spring water, and the [[Salix babylonica#Horticultural selections and related hybrids|weeping willows]] that grow along the water edges. The late-Qing author [[Liu E (writer)|Liu E]] describes Jinan's cityscape in his novel "The Travels of Lao Can" ({{lang|zh-hans|{{linktext|老|残|游|记}}}}, written 1903–04, published in 1907) as "Every family has spring water, every household has a willow tree".<ref>Original {{zh|s=家家泉水，户户垂杨 |t=家家泉水，戶戶垂楊}}</ref> Jinan was also the historical center of Buddhist culture for the whole province which is still manifest in the many historic sites that are left behind in its southern counties.

===Springs and lakes===
[[File:Baotuspring 10000 bamboo garden courtyard 2008 09 14.jpg|thumb|Pavilion in the 10,000 Bamboo Garden of [[Baotu Spring|Baotu Spring Park]]|left]]
Jinan is known as the "City of Springs" because of the large number of natural artesian springs. The majority of the springs, many of which have been historically listed under the "[[List of sites in Jinan#Springs|72 Famous Springs]]" ({{linktext|lang=zh|七|十|二|名|泉}}) are concentrated in the downtown district and flow north to converge in [[Daming Lake]].<ref name="spr"/> The [[Baotu Spring|Baotu Spring Park]] is the most popular of the springs in the City of Jinan proper. Besides the Baotu Spring, the park contains several other springs that are listed among the "72 Famous Springs". "Bào tū" ({{linktext|lang=zh|趵|突}}) means "jumping and leaping" in Chinese. The water in the spring pool can be seen foaming and gushing, looking like a pot of boiling water. The spring was visited by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] (1711–1799) of the [[Qing dynasty]] who declared it "the best spring under the heaven" ({{zh|c={{linktext|天下第一泉}}|p=tiān xià dì yī quán}}). A tablet with the Emperor's handwriting "Baotu Spring" has since been erected beside the spring pool.

Not far away to the northeast of Baotu Spring Park is the [[Daming Lake]], which, together with Baotu Spring and the [[Thousand-Buddha Mountain]] is often regarded as the "Three Greatest Attractions in Jinan". Other notable parks in the city include the [[Five Dragon Pool]] ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|五|龙|潭}}) near the Baotu Spring Park, the [[Black Tiger Spring]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|黑|虎|泉}}) on the southern city moat, and the [[Baimai Springs]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|百|脉|泉}}) of [[Zhangqiu City]] to the east of Jinan.

===Museums and libraries===
[[File:山東省博物館正廳.jpg|thumb|Hall of Shandong Provincial Museum]]
The [[Shandong Provincial Museum]] located at the foothill of [[Thousand-Buddha Mountain]] is the largest museum in the province. It has a large collection of natural as well as historical treasures from the whole province. The museum was established in its present form in 1982 and currently has 8 exhibition halls : "Treasures of Shandong Province"; "Stone Sculptures"; "Warship of the [[Ming dynasty]]"; "Ancient Coins"; "Art Treasures"; "Fossil Collections"; "Dinosaurs"; and "Specimens". The museum has more than 210,000 relics and specimens, making up ⅓ of the collections in museums of whole province.

The Jinan Municipal Museum is located at the south-western foot of the Thousand-Buddha Mountain, in the north of the city center. Although much smaller than the provincial museum, the municipal museum still houses a collection of more than 20,000 items, most of which were recovered in the city area.<ref>[http://www.jnmuseum.com Jinan Municipal Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107093019/http://www.jnmuseum.com/ |date=January 7, 2008 }}</ref> The [[Shandong Art Museum]] is a large museum of [[fine arts]] built near the Provincial Museum.

The library also has a large collection of western journals/books. Originally, the library was built close to Daming Lake in 1909 by the then governor of Shandong. In the late 1990s, a project was undertaken to move the library to the eastern part of the city, and it reopened in 2002 with 35 reading rooms and more than 2000 seats.
