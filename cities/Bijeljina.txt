==History==
===Prehistory and Antiquity===
The earliest established evidence of human life in the area of today's Bijeljina date from the [[New Stone Age]] (5000–3000BC). Characteristics of pottery, tools and weapons confirm cultural connections of indigenous inhabitants of Semberija with the eneolithic and Bronze Age cultures – Vučedol, Kostolac and [[Baden culture]].<ref name="osbih" /><ref>{{cite book |title=Information Bulletin of the Association of Writers of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Yugoslav Author's Agency for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Issues 7-9 |author=Udruženje književnika BiH |date=1985}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nikolova |editor1-first=Lolita |editor2-last=Manzura |editor2-first=I.

===Old Slavs and Middle Ages===
[[File:Trg Kralju Petru Karadjordjevicu I.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Peter I of Serbia|Petar Karađorđević I]] monument]]

The oldest archeological site of this period is located on both sides of the Bistrik channel, between the villages of Batković and Ostojićevo and it consists of four smaller sites which date from the period of the 7th to the 12th century. At Jazbina and Oraščić, remains were found of a settlement with half-buried huts, but the most significant discovery was a complex of metallurgical workshop at the site Čelopek where iron was melted in the 8th century and iron tools were manufactured. The oldest religious building, the [[Tavna Monastery]] was built in the Middle Ages. The region was incorporated into the [[Bosnian banate]] during the reign of [[Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia|Stephen Kotromanić]]. At this time the village Bistrik was called Bistrica and it was the center of the parish, which covered the entire territory of present-day city of Bijeljina.<ref name="city">{{cite web |title=History of the City of Bijeljina |url=https://investinbijeljina.org/en/2208.history-of-the-city-of-bijeljina.html |website=City of Bijeljina |access-date=21 January 2023 |archive-date=21 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230121021436/https://investinbijeljina.org/en/2208.history-of-the-city-of-bijeljina.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The first documented mention of the name Bijeljina occurred in 1446. The city fully fell to the Ottomans in 1530. Following the [[Great Turkish War]], it was incorporated into Austrian possession before being retaken by the Ottomans in 1739. Many of the settlements were decimated as a result of unsuccessful Serb rebellions against the occupation.<ref name="city" />

[[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] rule lasted from 1878 until 1918.<ref name="city" /> The name Bijeljina was only used after 1918 and [[World War I]]. During Austro-Hungarian rule, the town had the name Bjelina and, before that, Belina or Bilina.

===Modern history===
In 1838, the first confessional elementary school was opened. A modern school building was built in 1902. In this school [[Jovan Dučić]], famous Herzegovinian Serb poet, writer and diplomat, worked between 1893 and 1895.<ref name="oza">[http://www.oaza.rs/bijeljina/skolstvo-s.htm Bijeljina na Internetu - skolstvo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311041801/http://www.oaza.rs/bijeljina/skolstvo-s.htm |date=11 March 2012 }}, Oaza.rs; accessed 9 July 2015.{{in lang|sr}}</ref>

In front of City Hall is a statue of King [[Peter I of Serbia]], who ruled the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] between 1903 and 1918. During the [[Second World War]], the [[Ustaša]] removed it. After [[World War II]], the communist government refused to return the monument. The first non-communist local government returned the monument in the early 1990s.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

====Bosnian War====
{{main|Bijeljina massacre}}
In September 1991, [[Bosnian Serbs]] proclaimed a [[Serbian Autonomous Oblast]] with Bijeljina as its capital. In March 1992, the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina independence referendum, 1992|Bosnian referendum on independence]] was passed with overwhelming support from Bosniaks and [[Bosnian Croats]]. Local Bosniak [[Patriotic League (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Patriotic League]] had been established in response to the Bosnian Serb proclamation and started the clashes. On 1–2 April, the SDG and the JNA overtook Bijeljina with little resistance; A [[Bijeljina massacre|massacre]] was carried out and involved the killing of between 48 and 78 civilians by [[Serbs|Serb]] [[paramilitary]] groups. The majority of those killed were [[Bosniaks]] (or Bosnian Muslims). The dead included members of other ethnicities, such as Serbs deemed unloyal by the local authorities. The killing was committed by a local paramilitary group known as Mirko's [[Chetniks]] and by the [[Serb Volunteer Guard]] (SDG, also known as Arkan's Tigers), a [[Republic of Serbia (1990-2006)|Serbia]]-based [[paramilitary]] group under the command of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA).

The village of [[Batković]] in the municipality of Bijeljina was the site of the [[Batković camp]], believed to be the first concentration camp in operation during the [[Bosnian War]]. It was run by Serbs from 1 April 1992 until late January 1996.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oslobodjenje.ba/vijesti/bih/prezivjeli-logoras-iz-batkovica-i-danas-sanjam-da-mi-neko-ulazi-u-kucu-i-stavlja-pusku-na-celo |title=Preživjeli logoraš iz Batkovića: I danas sanjam da mi neko ulazi u kuću i stavlja pušku na čelo |publisher=Oslobođenje |date=1 April 2015 |access-date=18 April 2015 |archive-date=17 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417111522/http://www.oslobodjenje.ba/vijesti/bih/prezivjeli-logoras-iz-batkovica-i-danas-sanjam-da-mi-neko-ulazi-u-kucu-i-stavlja-pusku-na-celo |url-status=live }}</ref> The prisoners were predominantly ethnic [[Bosniaks]], who were tortured, sexually assaulted, and killed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/friendships-flourished-in-batkovic-prison-camp.29.html?news_id=14811 |title=FRIENDSHIPS FLOURISHED IN BATKOVIC PRISON CAMP |publisher=Sense Agency |date=3 April 2013 |access-date=18 April 2015 |archive-date=28 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190428200006/http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/friendships-flourished-in-batkovic-prison-camp.29.html%3Fnews_id%3D14811 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=James Gow |title=The Serbian Project and Its Adversaries: A Strategy of War Crimes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1PP987m08R8C&pg=PA135 |year=2003 |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |isbn=978-0-7735-2385-2 |page=135}}</ref> A "State Commission for the Free transfer of the Civilian Population" or "Commission for the Exchange of Population" was created and headed by Vojkan Đurković, a [[Major (rank)|Major]] in the SDG.

====Post-war period====
[[File:Bijeljinabypopulation.png|thumb|200px|Bijeljina municipality by population proportional to the settlement with the highest and lowest population]]

Post-war development of Bijeljina is experienced in the late 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century. After a population boom due to war events and population saturation and insufficient capacity of the city that was built in less need, today there is re-building of Bijeljina with new settlements, roads, schools, universities, and cultural institutions.

The [[Serb Democratic Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Serb Democratic Party]] (SDS) governed Bijeljina for 28 years since 1992. Following the [[2018 Bosnian general election]], in March 2020 mayor [[Mićo Mićić]] (governing the city since 2004) left the party to found the Party of Democratic Srpska of Semberija (SDSS) and signed a coalition agreement with [[Milorad Dodik]]'s [[Alliance of Independent Social Democrats|SNSD]]. In June 2020, SDSS and SNSD put SDS in minority in the local council. At the [[2020 Bosnian municipal elections]], SDS's Ljubiša Petrović became the new mayor, succeeding Mićić.

It was used as a defensive bastion in the [[Austro-Turkish War (1716–1718)|Austro-Turkish War]] and converted to a catholic church by Austrians during 1718-1739. After the [[Treaty of Belgrade]], it reverted back to the mosque, and went through several renovations in the 19th and early 20th century.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Atik Džamija {{!}} Turistička organizacija grada Bijeljine |url=https://www.bijeljinaturizam.com/destinacija?naslov=Atik%20D%C5%BEamija&pregled=12 |access-date=2024-07-15 |website=www.bijeljinaturizam.com}}</ref> The mosque was completely destroyed on 13 March 1993 and rebuilt where it stood before.

Serbian Orthodox Church (''Svetog Đorđa'') [[Saint George]] is located at the site of an older church, which was first mentioned in 1735.

The [[Tavna Monastery]] is located in the southern part of the Bijeljina municipality. The date of foundation is hidden somewhere in the shadows of the far past. The chronicles of monasteries [[Tronoša Monastery|Tronoša]] and [[Patriarchate of Peć (monastery)|Peć]] say it was built by [[Stefan Dragutin]]'s sons Vladislav and Uroš II Milutin. [[Stefan Dragutin]] was the King of Serbia from 1276 to 1282 and king of [[Srem]] from 1282 to 1316. The present church of monastery Tavna is built in the same place as the original one. The Tavna Monastery is older than the other monasteries in the region such as Ozrena, Liplja, Vozuce and Gostovica. Tavna was damaged in the first years of Turkish rule, but was restored by the people. This was not the only time the monastery was damaged. It was damaged many times during the Turkish period and also during World War Two. Between 1941 and 1945, Tavna was bombed by the [[Ustase]]. One of the gravestones says ''"Zdravko Jovanovic Killed 1943 by the Ustasa Blue Division protecting and defending the monastery".'' After WWII Tavna was rebuilt.<ref>[http://www.bijeljina.net/tavna/indexe.htm Tavna monastery infosite] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512080407/http://www.bijeljina.net/tavna/indexe.htm |date=12 May 2008 }}, Bijeljina.net; accessed 9 July 2015.</ref>
