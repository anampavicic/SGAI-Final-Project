Tasman named the island '''Anthony van Diemen's Land''' after his sponsor [[Anthony van Diemen]], the Governor of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The name was later shortened to '''Van Diemen's Land''' by the British. It was officially renamed '''Tasmania''' in honour of its first European discoverer on 1 January 1856.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/php/BecomingTasmania/BTAppend2.htm |title=Appendix 2: Select chronology of renaming |last1=Newman |first1=Terry |year=2005 |work=Becoming Tasmania – Companion Web Site |publisher=[[Parliament of Tasmania]] |access-date=26 August 2011 |archive-date=22 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422111627/http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/php/BecomingTasmania/BTAppend2.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Tasmania was sometimes referred to as "Dervon", as mentioned in the [[Jerilderie Letter]] written by the notorious Australian [[bushranger]] [[Ned Kelly]] in 1879. The colloquial expression for the state is "Tassie". Tasmania is also colloquially shortened to "Tas", mainly when used in business names and website addresses. TAS is also the [[Australian postal abbreviations|Australia Post abbreviation]] for the state.

In the constructed [[palawa kani]] language, the main island of Tasmania is called '''lutruwita''',<ref name=":4">{{cite news |title=Tasmanian Aboriginal place names |publisher=Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre |url=http://tacinc.com.au/tasmanian-aboriginal-place-names/ |access-date=30 November 2019 |archive-date=19 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191119003129/http://tacinc.com.au/tasmanian-aboriginal-place-names/ |url-status=live }}</ref> a name originally derived from the [[Bruny Island Tasmanian language]].

However, he also recorded it as a name for [[Cape Barren Island]]. In the 20th century, some writers used it as an Aboriginal name for Tasmania, spelled "Trowenna" or "Trowunna".

A number of [[palawa kani]] names, based on historical records of aboriginal names, have been accepted by the Tasmanian government. A dozen of these (below) are 'dual-use' (bilingual) names, and another two are unbounded areas with only palawa names.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tacinc.com.au/official-aboriginal-and-dual-names/|title=Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre – Official Aboriginal and Dual Names of places|website=tacinc.com.au|access-date=23 September 2019|archive-date=25 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190925075102/http://tacinc.com.au/official-aboriginal-and-dual-names/|url-status=live}}</ref>

There are also a number of archaeological sites with Palawa names.

As well as a diverse First Nations geography, where remnants are preserved in rough form by European documentation, Tasmania is known as a place for [[Place names considered unusual|unorthodox place-names]].<ref>{{cite web |title=QUIRKY PLACE NAMES OF TASMANIA |url=https://www.discovertasmania.com.au/about/articles/quirky-place-names-of-tasmania |website=Discover Tasmania |access-date=31 August 2021 |archive-date=1 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210901000432/https://www.discovertasmania.com.au/about/articles/quirky-place-names-of-tasmania |url-status=live }}</ref> These names often come about from lost definitions, where descriptive names have lost their old meanings and have taken on new modern interpretations (e.g. 'Bobs Knobs'). Other names have retained their original meaning, and are often quaint or endearing descriptions (e.g. [[Paradise, Tasmania|'Paradise']]).

[[File:Tasmania simple geology map.png|thumb|left|Map showing the general geological surface features of Tasmania. Note the extent of [[Diabase|dolerite]], and the mosaics in the west.]]

===Physical history===
{{Main|Geology of Tasmania}}
[[File:Tessellated Pavement Sunrise Landscape.jpg|thumb|[[Tessellated pavement]], a rare rock formation on the [[Tasman Peninsula]]]]
The island was adjoined to the mainland of Australia until the end of the [[last glacial period]] about 11,700 years ago.<ref name="nma2"/> Much of the island is composed of [[Jurassic]] [[Diabase|dolerite]] intrusions (the upwelling of [[magma]]) through other rock types, sometimes forming large columnar joints. Tasmania has the world's largest areas of dolerite, with many distinctive mountains and cliffs formed from this rock type. The [[Central Plateau (Tasmania)|central plateau]] and the southeast portions of the island are mostly dolerites. [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mount Wellington]] above [[Hobart]] is a good example, showing distinct columns known as the Organ Pipes.

In the southern midlands as far south as Hobart, the dolerite is underlaid by [[sandstone]] and similar sedimentary stones. In the southwest, [[Precambrian]] [[quartzite]]s were formed from very ancient sea sediments and form strikingly sharp ridges and ranges, such as Federation Peak or [[Frenchmans Cap, Tasmania|Frenchmans Cap]].

In the northeast and east, continental [[granite]]s can be seen, such as at Freycinet, similar to coastal granites on mainland Australia. In the northwest and west, mineral-rich volcanic rock can be seen at [[Mount Read (Tasmania)|Mount Read]] near [[Rosebery, Tasmania|Rosebery]], or at [[Mount Lyell, Tasmania|Mount Lyell]] near [[Queenstown, Tasmania|Queenstown]]. Also present in the south and northwest is [[limestone]] with caves.

The quartzite and dolerite areas in the higher mountains show evidence of [[glaciation]], and much of Australia's glaciated landscape is found on the Central Plateau and the Southwest. [[Cradle Mountain]], another dolerite peak, for example, was a [[nunatak]]. The combination of these different rock types contributes to scenery which is distinct from any other region of the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} In the far southwest corner of the state, the geology is almost wholly quartzite, which gives the mountains the false impression of having snow-capped peaks year round.

=== European arrival and governance ===

[[File:Abel Tasman Navigateur en Australie (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tasmania is named after Dutch explorer [[Abel Tasman]], the first European to sight the island, in 1642.]]

The first reported sighting of Tasmania by a [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europe]]an was on 24 November 1642 by Dutch explorer [[Abel Tasman]], who landed at today's [[Blackman Bay, Tasmania|Blackman Bay]]. More than a century later, in 1772, a French expedition led by [[Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne]] landed at (nearby but different) [[Blackmans Bay, Tasmania|Blackmans Bay]], and the following year [[Tobias Furneaux]] became the first Englishman to land in Tasmania when he arrived at [[Adventure Bay, Tasmania|Adventure Bay]], which he named after his ship [[HMS Adventure (1771)|HMS ''Adventure'']]. Captain [[James Cook]] also landed at [[Adventure Bay, Tasmania|Adventure Bay]] in 1777. [[Matthew Flinders]] and [[George Bass]] sailed through [[Bass Strait]] in 1798{{ndash}}1799, determining for the first time that Tasmania was an island.<ref name="hughes121">{{Citation|last=Hughes|first=Robert|title=The Fatal Shore|publisher=Pan|year=1987|location=London|isbn=978-0-330-29892-6|pages=120–125|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/fatalshorehistor00hugh/page/120}}</ref>

Sealers and whalers based themselves on Tasmania's islands from 1798,<ref>{{Citation | last=Boyce | first = James | title = Van Diemen's Land  | publisher = Black Inc | year = 2010 | location = Melbourne | page=15| isbn = 978-1-86395-491-4}}</ref> and in August 1803 [[New South Wales]] Governor [[Philip Gidley King|Philip King]] sent Lieutenant [[John Bowen (Royal Navy officer)|John Bowen]] to establish a small military outpost on the eastern shore of the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|Derwent River]] in order to forestall any claims to the island by French explorers who had been exploring the southern Australian coastline. Bowen, who led a party of 49, including 21 male and three female convicts, named the camp Risdon.<ref name="hughes121" /><ref>{{Citation | last=Boyce | first = James | title = Van Diemen's Land  | publisher = Black Inc | year = 2010 | location = Melbourne | page=21| isbn = 978-1-86395-491-4}}</ref>

Several months later, a second settlement was established by Captain [[David Collins (lieutenant governor)|David Collins]], with 308 convicts, {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the south in [[Sullivans Cove]] on the western side of the Derwent, where fresh water was more plentiful. The latter settlement became known as Hobart Town or Hobarton, later shortened to [[Hobart]], after the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|British Colonial Secretary]] of the time, [[Lord Hobart]]. The settlement at Risdon was later abandoned. Left on their own without further supplies, the Sullivans Cove settlement suffered severe food shortages and by 1806 its inhabitants were starving, with many resorting to scraping seaweed off rocks and scavenging washed-up whale blubber from the shore to survive.<ref name="hughes121" />

A smaller colony was established at Port Dalrymple on the Tamar River in the island's north in October 1804 and several other convict-based settlements were established, including the particularly harsh [[penal colony|penal colonies]] at [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] in the southeast and [[Macquarie Harbour]] on the West Coast. Tasmania was eventually sent 75,000 convicts—four out of every ten people transported to Australia.<ref name="hughes121" /> By 1819, the Aboriginal and British population reached parity with about 5000 of each, although among the colonists men outnumbered women four-to-one.<ref name="parity">{{Citation | last=Ryan | first = Lyndall | title = Tasmanian Aborigines  | publisher = Allen & Unwin | year = 2012 | pages= 54–57, 71|location = Sydney | isbn = 978-1-74237-068-2}}</ref> Free settlers began arriving in large numbers from 1820, lured by the promise of land grants and free convict labour. Settlement in the island's northwest corner was monopolised by the [[Van Diemen's Land Company]], which sent its first surveyors to the district in 1826. By 1830, one-third of Australia's non-Indigenous population lived in Van Diemen's Land and the island accounted for about half of all land under cultivation and exports.<ref>{{Citation | last=Boyce | first = James | title = Van Diemen's Land  | publisher = Black Inc | year = 2010 | location = Melbourne | pages=140, 145, 202| isbn = 978-1-86395-491-4}}</ref>

Tensions between Tasmania's Aboriginal and white inhabitants rose, partly driven by increasing competition for kangaroo and other game.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/13150130?searchTerm=treaty%20aboriginal |title=The Fate Of The Aboriginal Inhabitants (Sydney Morning Herald, 21 Feb 1867, p.8) |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=21 February 1867 |access-date=17 August 2022 |archive-date=17 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220817003525/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/13150130?searchTerm=treaty%20aboriginal |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://theconversation.com/tasmanias-black-war-a-tragic-case-of-lest-we-remember-25663 | title = Tasmania's Black War: a tragic case of lest we remember? | first = Nicholas | last = Clements | date = 24 April 2014 | work = Honorary Research Associate, University of Tasmania | publisher = The Conversation | access-date = 27 October 2016 | archive-date = 27 October 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161027124612/http://theconversation.com/tasmanias-black-war-a-tragic-case-of-lest-we-remember-25663 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia | url = https://www.britannica.com/event/Black-War | title = Black War – Australian History | encyclopedia = The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | access-date = 27 October 2016 | archive-date = 27 October 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161027125931/https://www.britannica.com/event/Black-War | url-status = live }}</ref> Explorer and naval officer [[John Oxley]] in 1810 noted the "many atrocious cruelties" inflicted on Aboriginal people by convict [[bushranger]]s in the north, which in turn led to black attacks on solitary white hunters.<ref>{{Citation | last=Clements | first = Nicholas | title = The Black War  |page=36| publisher = University of Queensland Press | year = 2014 | location = Brisbane | isbn = 978-0-70225-006-4}}</ref> Hostilities increased further with the arrival of 600 colonists from [[Norfolk Island]] between 1807 and 1813. They established farms along the River Derwent and east and west of [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], occupying ten percent of Van Diemen's Land. By 1824 the colonial population had swelled to 12,600, while the island's sheep population had reached 200,000. The rapid colonisation transformed traditional kangaroo hunting grounds into farms with grazing livestock as well as fences, hedges and stone walls, while police and military patrols were increased to control the convict farm labourers.<ref>{{Citation | last=Ryan | first = Lyndall | title = Tasmanian Aborigines  | publisher = Allen & Unwin | year = 2012 | pages=58, 62, 66, 74–75|location = Sydney | isbn = 978-1-74237-068-2}}</ref>

Violence began to spiral rapidly from the mid-1820s in what became described as the "[[Black War]]".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/65989331 |title=The Black War (The Cornwall Chronicle, Launceston: 8 Sep, 1860, p.3) |newspaper=Cornwall Chronicle |date=8 September 1860 |access-date=10 August 2022 |archive-date=10 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220810231144/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/65989331 |url-status=live }}</ref> Aboriginal inhabitants were driven to desperation by hunger – that included a desire for agricultural produce, as well as feeling anger at the prevalence of abductions of women and girls.

From 1825 to 1828, the number of native attacks more than doubled each year, raising panic among settlers. Over the summer of 1826{{ndash}}1827 clans from the Big River, Oyster Bay and North Midlands nations speared stock-keepers on farms and made it clear that they wanted the settlers and their sheep and cattle to move from their kangaroo hunting grounds. Settlers responded vigorously, resulting in many mass-killings. In November 1826, Governor [[Sir George Arthur, 1st Baronet|Sir George Arthur]] issued a government notice declaring that colonists were free to kill Aboriginal people when they attacked settlers or their property, and in the following eight months more than 200 Aboriginal people were killed in the Settled Districts in reprisal for the deaths of 15 colonists.

In November 1830, Arthur organised the so-called "[[Black Line]]", ordering every able-bodied male colonist to assemble at one of seven designated places in the Settled Districts to join a massive drive to sweep Aboriginal people out of the region and on to the [[Tasman Peninsula]].

After hostilities between settlers and Aboriginal peoples ceased in 1832, almost all of the remnants of the Indigenous population were persuaded by government agent [[George Augustus Robinson]] to move to [[Flinders Island, Tasmania|Flinders Island]].

The [[Privy Council]] also approved the colony changing its name from "Van Diemen's Land" to "Tasmania", and in 1856 the newly elected [[bicameral parliament]] sat for the first time, establishing Tasmania as a [[responsible government|self-governing]] colony of the British Empire.<ref>{{cite web|last=Museum of Australian Democracy|title=Constitution Act 1855 (Tas)|url=https://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-34.html|access-date=25 July 2021|website=Documenting Democracy|archive-date=24 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210724232320/https://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-34.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The colony suffered from economic fluctuations, but for the most part was prosperous, experiencing steady growth. With few external threats and strong trade links with the Empire, Tasmania enjoyed many fruitful periods in the late 19th century, becoming a world-centre of shipbuilding. It raised a local defence force that eventually played a [[Military history of Australia during the Second Boer War|significant role]] in the [[Second Boer War]] in South Africa, and Tasmanian soldiers in that conflict won the first two [[Victoria Cross]]es awarded to Australians.

==== Federation ====

In 1901, the Colony of Tasmania [[Federation of Australia|united]] with the five other Australian colonies to form the Commonwealth of Australia. Tasmanians voted in favour of federation with the largest majority of all the Australian colonies.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Tasmania}}
{{cleanup split|Geography of Tasmania|date=October 2022}}
[[File:Topography of Tasmania.jpg|thumb|Topography of Tasmania]]
Tasmania, the largest island of Australia, has a landmass of {{convert|68401|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and is located directly in the pathway of the notorious "[[Roaring Forties]]" wind that encircles the globe. To its north, it is separated from mainland Australia by [[Bass Strait]]. Tasmania is the only Australian state that is not located on the Australian mainland. About {{convert|2500|km|nmi|abbr=off}} south of Tasmania island lies the [[George V Coast]] of [[Antarctica]]. Depending on which [[borders of the oceans]] are used, the island can be said to be either surrounded by the Southern Ocean, or to have the Pacific on its east and the Indian to its west. Still other definitions of the ocean boundaries would have Tasmania with the [[Great Australian Bight]] to the west, and the [[Tasman Sea]] to the east. The southernmost point on mainland Tasmania is approximately {{coord|43|38|37|S|146|49|38|E}} at [[South East Cape]], and the northernmost point on mainland Tasmania is approximately {{coord|40|38|26|S|144|43|33|E}} in [[Woolnorth / Temdudheker, Tasmania|Woolnorth / Temdudheker]] near [[Cape Grim/Kennaook|Cape Grim / Kennaook]]. Tasmania lies at similar latitudes to [[South Island|Te Waipounamu / South Island]] of New Zealand and parts of [[Patagonia]] in South America. Areas at equivalent latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere include [[Hokkaido]] in Japan, [[Northeast China]] ([[Manchuria]]), [[Central Italy]], and United States cities such as [[New York City|New York]] and [[Chicago]]. 
[[File:Mortimer Bay-3.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Due to Tasmania's proximity to the [[south magnetic pole]] towards [[Antarctica]], the [[Aurora|''Aurora australis'']] can sometimes be seen.]]
The most mountainous region is the [[Central Highlands (Tasmania)|Central Highlands]] area, which covers most of the central western parts of the state. The [[Midlands (Tasmania)|Midlands]] located in the central east, is fairly flat, and is predominantly used for agriculture, although farming activity is scattered throughout the state. Tasmania's tallest mountain is [[Mount Ossa (Tasmania)|Mount Ossa]] at {{convert|1617|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tourtasmania.com/content.php?id=ossa |title=Mt.

The [[Tarkine]], containing [[Savage River National Park]] located in the island's far north west, is the largest [[temperate rainforest]] area in Australia covering about {{convert|3800|km2|sqmi}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://discoverthetarkine.com.au/the-tarkine/|title=The Tarkine|access-date=1 June 2021|archive-date=2 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210602214905/https://discoverthetarkine.com.au/the-tarkine/|url-status=live}}</ref> With its rugged topography, Tasmania has a great number of rivers. Several of Tasmania's largest rivers have been dammed at some point to provide [[hydroelectricity]]. Many rivers begin in the Central Highlands and flow out to the coast. Tasmania's major population centres are mainly situated around [[estuaries]] (some of which are named rivers).

Tasmania is in the shape of a downward-facing triangle, likened to a shield, heart, or face. It consists of the main island as well as at least a thousand neighbouring islands within the state's jurisdiction. The largest of these are [[Flinders Island]] in the [[Furneaux Group]] of [[Bass Strait]], [[King Island (Tasmania)|King Island]] in the west of Bass Strait, [[Cape Barren Island]] south of Flinders Island, [[Bruny Island]] separated from Tasmania by the [[D'Entrecasteaux Channel]], [[Macquarie Island]] 1,500&nbsp;km from Tasmania, and [[Maria Island]] off the east coast. 
Tasmania features a number of separated and continuous mountain ranges. The majority of the state is defined by a significant [[Diabase|dolerite]] exposure, though the [[Western Tasmania|western half]] of the state is older and more rugged, featuring [[buttongrass]] plains, temperate rainforests, and [[quartzite]] ranges, notably [[Federation Peak]] and [[Frenchmans Cap]]. The presence of these mountain ranges is a primary factor in the [[Rain shadow|rain shadow effect]], where the western half receives the majority of rainfall, which also influences the types of vegetation that can grow. The Central Highlands feature a large plateau which forms a number of ranges and escarpments on its north side, tapering off along the south, and radiating into the highest mountain ranges in the west. At the north-west of this, another plateau radiates into a system of hills where [[Tarkine|takayna / Tarkine]] is located.

The [[Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia| Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA)]] divides Tasmania into 9 bioregions:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/nrs/science/bioregion-framework/ibra/index.html|title=Australia's bioregions (IBRA)|work=Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities|publisher=[[Commonwealth of Australia]]|year=2012|access-date=1 September 2021|archive-date=16 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016124642/http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/nrs/science/bioregion-framework/ibra/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Tasmania's environment consistes of many different biomes or communities across its different regions. It is the most forested state in Australia, and preserves the country's largest areas of [[temperate rainforest]]. A distinctive type of [[moorland]] found across the west, and particularly south-west of Tasmania, are [[buttongrass]] plains, which are speculated to have been expanded by [[Tasmanian Aboriginal]] [[Fire-stick farming|burning practices]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Mystery still surrounds origin of iconic button grass plains |url=https://www.utas.edu.au/communications/general-news/all-news/mystery-still-surrounds-origin-of-iconic-button-grass-plains |website=University of Tasmania |access-date=5 September 2021 |archive-date=5 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210905000317/https://www.utas.edu.au/communications/general-news/all-news/mystery-still-surrounds-origin-of-iconic-button-grass-plains |url-status=live }}</ref> Tasmania also features a diverse [[Alpine plant|alpine garden]] [[Alpine vegetation of Tasmania|environment]], such as [[Tasmanian cushion plants|cushion plant]]. Highland areas receive consistent [[snow]]fall above ~1,000 metres every year, and due to cold air from [[Antarctica]], this level often reaches 800 m, and more occasionally 600 or 400 metres. Every five or so years, snow can form at sea level.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=M.

On the [[West Coast Range]] and partially on [[Mount Field National Park|Mount Field]], Australia's only winter-[[deciduous]] plant, [[Nothofagus gunnii|deciduous beech]] is found, which forms a carpet or [[krummholz]], or very rarely a 4-metre tree.<ref>{{cite web |title=BUREAU OF BIODIVERSITY AWARENESSFEATURE ARTICLEISSUE ONEMAGAZINE The Last Deciduous Tree in Tasmania |url=https://tasmaniangeographic.com/the-last-deciduous-tree/ |website=Tasmanian Geographic |date=August 2013 |access-date=4 September 2021 |archive-date=4 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210904232008/https://tasmaniangeographic.com/the-last-deciduous-tree/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Tasmania features a high concentration of [[waterfalls]]. These can be found in small creeks, alpine [[streams]], [[Rapids|rapid]] [[rivers]], or off precipitous plunges. Some of the tallest waterfalls are found on mountain [[massifs]], sometimes at a 200-metre cascade. The most famous and most visited waterfall in Tasmania is [[Russell Falls]] in [[Mount Field National Park|Mount Field]] due to its proximity to [[Hobart]] and stepped falls at a total height of 58 metres.<ref>{{cite web |title=Russell Falls |url=https://waterfallsoftasmania.com.au/waterfalls/russell_falls |website=Waterfalls of Tasmania |date=2 August 2020 |access-date=4 September 2021 |archive-date=4 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210904232007/https://waterfallsoftasmania.com.au/waterfalls/russell_falls |url-status=live }}</ref> 
Tasmania also has a large number of [[beaches]], the longest of which is [[Ocean Beach (Tasmania)|Ocean Beach]] on the [[West Coast, Tasmania|West Coast]] at about 40 kilometres.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ocean Beach |url=https://westcoasttas.com.au/listings/ocean-beach |website=West Coast Tasmania |access-date=4 September 2021 |archive-date=4 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210904231956/https://westcoasttas.com.au/listings/ocean-beach |url-status=live }}</ref> Wineglass Bay in [[Freycinet National Park|Freycinet]] on the east coast is a well-known [[landmark]] of the state.

The [[Tasmanian temperate rainforests]] cover a few different types. These are also considered distinct from the more common wet [[sclerophyll]] forests, though these [[Eucalyptus|eucalypt]] forests often form with [[rainforest]] [[understorey]] and [[ferns]] (such as [[Man fern|tree-ferns]]) are usually never absent. Rainforest found in deep [[Gully|gullies]] are usually difficult to traverse due to dense understorey growth, such as from [[Anodopetalum biglandulosum|horizontal (''Anodopetalum biglandulosum'')]]. Higher-elevation forests (~500 to 800 m) have smaller ground vegetation and are thus easier to walk in. The most common rainforests usually have a 50-metre<ref>{{cite web |title=Nothofagus cunninghamii – Hook.&Oerst. |url=https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Nothofagus+cunninghamii |website=Plants For a Future (PFAF) |access-date=4 September 2021 |archive-date=4 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210904231954/https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Nothofagus+cunninghamii |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] and are varied by environmental factors. Emergent growth usually comes from [[Eucalyptus regnans|eucalyptus]], which can tower another 50 metres higher (usually less), providing the most common choice of nesting for giant [[Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle|wedge-tailed eagles]].

The human environment ranges from urban or industrial development to farming or grazing land. The most cultivated area is the [[Midlands (Tasmania)|Midlands]], where it has suitable soil but is also the driest part of the state.

Tasmania's [[Wiktionary:insular#Adjective|insularity]] was possibly detected by Captain [[Abel Tasman]] when he charted Tasmania's coast in 1642. On 5 December, Tasman was following the [[East Coast of Australia|east coast]] northward to see how far it went. When the land veered to the north-west at [[Eddystone Point]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schilder |first1=Günter |title=Australia unveiled : the share of the Dutch navigators in the discovery of Australia |date=1976 |publisher=Theatrum Orbis Terrarum Ltd. |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-9022199978 |page=170}}</ref> he tried to keep in with it but his ships were suddenly hit by the [[Roaring Forties]] howling through [[Bass Strait]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Valentyn |first1=Francois |title=Oud en nieuw Oost-Indien |date=1724–1726 |publisher=J. van Braam |location=Dordrecht |isbn=9789051942347 |page=vol.3, p.47}}</ref> Tasman was on a mission to find the [[Terra Australis|Southern Continent]], not more islands, so he abruptly turned away to the east and continued his continent-hunting.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cameron-Ash |first1=M. |title=Lying for the Admiralty |date=2018 |publisher=Rosenberg |location=Sydney |isbn=9780648043966 |page=105}}</ref>

The next European to enter the strait was Captain [[James Cook]] on [[HMS Endeavour|HMS ''Endeavour'']] in April 1770. However, after sailing for two hours westward into the strait against the wind, he turned back east and noted in his journal that he was "doubtful whether they [i.e. Van Diemen's Land and New Holland] are one land or no".<ref>{{cite web|last=Cook|first=James|date=19 April 1770|title=Cook's Journal: Daily Entries|url=http://southseas.nla.gov.au/journals/cook/17700419.html|access-date=18 October 2020|website=National Library of Australia, South Seas Collection|archive-date=7 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200307215621/http://southseas.nla.gov.au/journals/cook/17700419.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The strait was named after George Bass, after he and Matthew Flinders passed through it while circumnavigating Van Diemen's Land in the ''Norfolk'' in 1798–99. At Flinders' recommendation, the Governor of New South Wales, John Hunter, in 1800 named the stretch of water between the mainland and Van Diemen's Land "Bass's Straits".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Flinders|first=Matthew|title=A Voyage to Terra Australis|year=1814}}</ref> Later it became known as Bass Strait.

The existence of the strait had been suggested in 1797 by the master of Sydney Cove when he reached Sydney after deliberately grounding his foundering ship and being stranded on Preservation Island (at the eastern end of the strait). He reported that the strong south westerly swell and the tides and currents suggested that the island was in a channel linking the Pacific and southern Indian Ocean. Governor Hunter thus wrote to Joseph Banks in August 1797 that it seemed certain a strait existed.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Blainey|first=Geoffrey|title=Tyranny of Distance: How Distance Shaped Australia's History.|publisher=Sun Books|year=1966|location=Melbourne|pages=73–74}}</ref>

Tasmania has a relatively cool temperate climate compared to the rest of Australia, spared from the hot summers of the mainland and experiencing four distinct seasons.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discovertasmania.com.au/about/climate-and-weather | title = Climate and weather | author = Discover Tasmania | work = Writer for Discover Tasmania | publisher = Discover Tasmania | location = Tasmania, Australia | access-date = 27 October 2016 | archive-date = 30 October 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161030171403/http://www.discovertasmania.com.au/about/climate-and-weather | url-status = live }}</ref> Summer is from December to February when the average maximum sea temperature is {{convert|21|°C|°F}} and inland areas around Launceston reach {{convert|24|°C|°F}}. Other inland areas are much cooler, with [[Liawenee]], located on the Central Plateau, one of the coldest places in Australia, ranging between {{convert|4|and|17|°C|°F}} in February. Autumn is from March to May, with mostly settled weather, as summer patterns gradually take on the shape of winter patterns.<ref>{{cite news|title=Climate of Launceston |work=Australian BOM |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/tas/launceston/climate.shtml |access-date=1 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222154659/http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/tas/launceston/climate.shtml |archive-date=22 February 2009 }}</ref> The winter months are from June to August and are generally the wettest and coldest months in the state, with most high lying areas receiving considerable snowfall. Winter maximums are {{convert|12|°C|°F}} on average along coastal areas and {{convert|3|°C|°F}} on the central plateau, as a result of a series of cold fronts from the [[Southern Ocean]]. Inland areas receive regular freezes throughout the winter months. Spring is from September to November, and is an unsettled season of transition, where winter weather patterns begin to take the shape of summer patterns, although snowfall is still common up until October. Spring is generally the windiest time of the year with afternoon sea breezes starting to take effect on the coast.

Geographically and biological isolated, Tasmania is known for its unique [[endemic]] flora and fauna.

==== Flora ====
Tasmania has [[biodiversity|extremely diverse]] vegetation, from the heavily grazed grassland of the dry Midlands to the tall evergreen [[eucalypt]] forest, [[alpine climate|alpine]] heathlands and large areas of cool [[temperate rain forest|temperate rainforests]] and moorlands in the rest of the state. Many species are unique to Tasmania, and some are related to species in South America and New Zealand through ancestors which grew on the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], 50&nbsp;million years ago. ''[[Nothofagus gunnii]]'', commonly known as Australian beech, is Australia's only temperate native deciduous tree and is found exclusively in Tasmania.<ref>{{Cite news|date=6 March 2016|title=Why don't we have more native deciduous trees in Australia?|language=en-AU|work=ABC News|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2016-03-07/deciduous-trees-in-australia/7200608|access-date=10 January 2022|archive-date=13 January 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220113093139/https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2016-03-07/deciduous-trees-in-australia/7200608|url-status=live}}</ref>

Distinctive species of plant in Tasmania include:
* [[Eucalyptus regnans|''Eucalyptus regnans'' (mountain ash)]] – the [[List of superlative trees|tallest]] flowering plant and hardwood in the world, [[Centurion (tree)|reaching 100 m]] (328&nbsp;ft).<ref>{{cite web |title=Tall tree Centurion passes 100-metre mark, creating milestone for Tasmanian wilderness |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-12/new-milestone-for-australias-tallest-tree-centurion/10604588 |website=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=11 December 2018 |access-date=31 August 2021 |archive-date=14 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230514010002/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-12/new-milestone-for-australias-tallest-tree-centurion/10604588 |url-status=live }}</ref>

* [[Nothofagus gunnii|''Nothofagus gunnii'' (deciduous beech)]] – Australia's only winter-deciduous tree.
* [[Atherosperma moschatum|''Atherosperma moschatum'' (blackheart sassafras)]] – a co-dominant rainforest tree with a nutmeg aroma.
* [[Lagarostrobos franklinii|''Lagarostrobos franklinii'' (Huon pine)]] – one of the oldest-lived tree species, and a self-preserving timber. 
* [[Phyllocladus aspleniifolius|''Phyllocladus aspleniifolius'' (celery-top pine)]] – a celery-leaved conifer found in rainforests.

===== Bush tucker =====
{{See also|Bush tucker#Tasmania}}
Tasmania also has a number of [[Native species|native]] [[edible]]s, known as [[bush tucker]] in Australia. These plants were [[Foraging|foraged]] by the [[Tasmanian Aboriginals]] and also used for other purposes, such as [[construction]]. Unusual trees such as [[Eucalyptus gunnii|cider gum (''Eucalyptus gunnii'')]] had their [[Sap|manna]] used to make a [[syrup]] or an [[Alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] ([[cider]]). Other trees such as [[Acacia|wattles (acacias)]] like [[Acacia melanoxylon|blackwood (''Acacia melanoxylon'')]] and [[Acacia dealbata|mimosa (''Acacia dealbata'')]] could have their [[Wattleseed|seeds]] eaten or crushed into a [[powder]]. There are also many [[berries]] such as [[Gaultheria hispida|snowberry (''Gaultheria hispida'')]], [[fruits]] such as [[Aristotelia peduncularis|heartberry (''Aristotelia peduncularis'')]], and [[vegetables]] such as [[Mentha australis|river mint (''Mentha australis'')]], though no [[crops]] like [[maize]] that are used for large production.<ref>{{cite web |title=Edible Plants of Tasmania |url=https://www.habitatplants.com.au/hpwp/wp-content/uploads/Tas-Edible-Native-Plants.pdf |website=National Landcare Programme, NRM North |publisher=Australian Government |access-date=4 September 2021 |archive-date=4 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210904234431/https://www.habitatplants.com.au/hpwp/wp-content/uploads/Tas-Edible-Native-Plants.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Fauna ====
Tasmania has a large percentage of [[endemism]] whilst featuring many types of animals found on mainland Australia. Many of these species, such as the [[platypus]], are larger than their mainland relatives.<ref>{{cite web |title=Platypus in Tasmania |url=https://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/wildlife-management/fauna-of-tasmania/mammals/echidnas-and-platypus/platypus/platypus-in-tasmania |website=DPIPWE |access-date=2 September 2021 |archive-date=8 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200308221910/https://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/wildlife-management/fauna-of-tasmania/mammals/echidnas-and-platypus/platypus/platypus-in-tasmania |url-status=live }}</ref>
The island of Tasmania was home to the [[thylacine]], a [[marsupial]] which resembled a [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]] or some say a wild dog. Known colloquially as the Tasmanian tiger for the distinctive striping across its back, it became extinct in mainland Australia much earlier because of competition by the [[dingo]], introduced in prehistoric times. Owing to persecution by farmers, government-funded bounty hunters and, in the final years, collectors for overseas museums, it appears to have been exterminated in Tasmania. The [[Tasmanian devil]] became the [[Largest mammals#Marsupials (Marsupialia)|largest carnivorous marsupial]] in the world following the [[extinction]] of the [[thylacine]] in 1936 and is now found in the wild only in Tasmania. Tasmania was one of the last regions of Australia to be introduced to domesticated dogs. Dogs were brought from Britain in 1803 for hunting kangaroos and [[emu]]s. This introduction completely transformed Aboriginal society, as it helped them to successfully compete with European hunters and was more important than the introduction of guns for the Aboriginal people.<ref>Boyce, James, 'The social and Environmental impact of the introduction of the dog to Tasmania' in ''Environmental History'' Vol. 11, No. 1 (Jan. 2006), pp. 102–129</ref>

Tasmania is a hotspot for [[Island gigantism|giant habitat trees and the large animal species]] that occupy them, notably the endangered [[Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle|Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle (''Aquila audax fleayi'')]], the [[Tasmanian masked owl|Tasmanian masked owl (''Tyto novaehollandiae castanops'')]], the [[Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish|Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish (''Astacopsis gouldi'')]], the [[Yellow wattlebird|yellow wattlebird (''Anthochaera paradoxa'')]], the [[Green rosella|green rosella (''Platycercus caledonicus'')]] and others. Tasmania is also home to the world's only three migratory parrots, the critically endangered [[Orange-bellied parrot|Orange-bellied parrot (''Neophema chrysogaster'')]], the [[Blue-winged parrot|Blue-winged parrot (''Neophema chrysostoma'')]], and the fastest parrot in the world, the [[Swift parrot|swift parrot (''Lathamus discolor'')]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Saving the Swift Parrot |url=https://science.anu.edu.au/news-events/news/saving-swift-parrot#:~:text=The%20swift%20parrot%20%E2%80%93%20the%20world's,for%20this%20critically%20endangered%20bird. |website=Australian National University |access-date=31 August 2021 |archive-date=31 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210831085624/https://science.anu.edu.au/news-events/news/saving-swift-parrot#:~:text=The%20swift%20parrot%20%E2%80%93%20the%20world's,for%20this%20critically%20endangered%20bird. |url-status=live }}</ref>
Tasmania has 12 [[endemic]] species of [[bird]] in total.<ref>{{cite web |title=Birds |url=https://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/wildlife-management/fauna-of-tasmania/birds |website=DPIPWE |publisher=Tasmanian Government |access-date=2 September 2021 |archive-date=6 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210906111619/https://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/wildlife-management/fauna-of-tasmania/birds |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Mycology ====
Tasmania is a hotspot for [[Fungi|fungal]] diversity. The importance of fungi in Tasmania's ecology is often overlooked; nonetheless, they play a vital role in the natural vegetation cycle.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fungi – overlooked beauties |url=https://gardensforwildlife.dpipwe.tas.gov.au/gfw.nsf/GardenStories/1578E2AD9479A280CA2575D8002290B4?OpenDocument |website=Gardens for Wildlife, DPIPWE |access-date=31 August 2021 |archive-date=31 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210831053333/https://gardensforwildlife.dpipwe.tas.gov.au/gfw.nsf/GardenStories/1578E2AD9479A280CA2575D8002290B4?OpenDocument |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Conservation ====
Like the rest of Australia, Tasmania suffers from an [[endangered species]] problem. In particular, many important Tasmanian subspecies and world-significant species of [[animal]] are classified as at risk in some way. A famous example is the [[Tasmanian devil]], which is endangered due to [[devil facial tumour disease]]. Some species have already gone [[extinct]], primarily due to [[Human impact on the environment|human interference]], such as in the case of the [[thylacine]] or the [[Tasmanian emu]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Fact check: Does Australia have one of the 'highest loss of species anywhere in the world'?

In 2021, 50.0% of people in Tasmania reported having no religious affiliation, a substantial increase from 38.2% in 2016 and just 5.1% in 1971. Meanwhile, Christianity remained the largest religious affiliation in the state, with 38.4% identifying as Christian, though this proportion has steadily declined over time—from 88.7% in 1971 to 49.7% in 2016.<ref name="census2021"/>

Non-Christian religions accounted for 4.5% of the population in 2021, with Hinduism (1.7%), Buddhism (1.0%), and Islam (0.9%) being the most prevalent among them.<ref name="census2021"/><ref name="quickstats.censusdata.abs.gov.au"/><ref name="censusdata.abs.gov.au"/>

==Government==

[[File:Hobart-Tasmania-Australia04.JPG|thumb|[[Parliament House, Hobart]]]]

The form of the government of Tasmania is prescribed in [[Constitution of Tasmania|its constitution]], which dates from 1934. Since 1901, Tasmania has been a state of the Commonwealth of Australia, and the [[Australian Constitution]] regulates its relationship with the Commonwealth and prescribes which powers each level of government is allowed.

Tasmania is represented in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] by 12 senators, on an equal basis with all other states. In the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], Tasmania is entitled to five seats, which is the minimum allocation for a state guaranteed by the Constitution—the number of House of Representatives seats for each state is otherwise decided on the basis of their relative populations, and Tasmania has never qualified for five seats on that basis alone. Tasmania's [[Tasmanian House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] use a system of multi-seat [[proportional representation]] known as [[Single Transferable Vote|Hare-Clark]].

===Elections===
At the [[2002 Tasmanian state election|2002 state election]], the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] won 14 of the 25 House seats. The people decreased their vote for the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]]; representation in the Parliament fell to seven seats. The [[Tasmanian Greens|Greens]] won four seats, with over 18% of the popular vote, the highest proportion of any Green party in any parliament in the world at that time.

On 23 February 2004 the Premier [[Jim Bacon (politician)|Jim Bacon]] announced his retirement, after being diagnosed with lung cancer. In his last months he opened a vigorous anti-smoking campaign which included many restrictions on where individuals could smoke, such as pubs. He died four months later. Bacon was succeeded by [[Paul Lennon]], who, after leading the state for two years, went on to win the [[2006 Tasmanian state election|2006 state election]] in his own right. Lennon resigned in 2008 and was succeeded by [[David Bartlett]], who formed a coalition government with the Greens after the [[2010 Tasmanian state election|2010 state election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament]]. Bartlett resigned as Premier in January 2011 and was replaced by [[Lara Giddings]], who became Tasmania's first female Premier. In March 2014 [[Will Hodgman]]'s Liberal Party won government, ending sixteen years of Labor governance, and ending an eight-year period for Hodgman himself as [[Leader of the Opposition (Tasmania)|Leader of the Opposition]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-03-27/tasmanian-liberals-secure-15-seats-as-election-count-ends/5350000|title=Tasmanian Liberals secure 15 seats as election count ends|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=27 March 2014|access-date=1 May 2014|archive-date=5 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505235742/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-03-27/tasmanian-liberals-secure-15-seats-as-election-count-ends/5350000|url-status=live}}</ref> Hodgman then won a second term of government in the [[2018 Tasmanian state election|2018 state election]], but resigned mid-term in January 2020 and was replaced by [[Peter Gutwein]].<ref name="gutwein">{{cite news |title=Gutwein premier, Rockliff deputy, after Tasmanian Liberal rivals quit contest |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-20/tasmania-new-premier-announced-peter-gutwein/11880490 |access-date=20 January 2020 |work=ABC News |date=20 January 2020 |language=en-AU |archive-date=22 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200122161003/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-20/tasmania-new-premier-announced-peter-gutwein/11880490 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In May 2021, the [[2021 Tasmanian state election|Tasmanian state election]] was held after being called [[Snap election|early]] by the incumbent [[Liberal Party of Australia (Tasmanian Division)|Liberal Party]], resulting in their return to government and establishment of a one-seat majority.

===Politics===
Tasmania has a number of undeveloped regions. Proposals for local economic development have been faced with requirements for environmental sensitivity, or opposition. In particular, proposals for hydroelectric power generation were debated in the late 20th century. In the 1970s, opposition to the construction of the [[Lake Pedder]] reservoir impoundment led to the formation of the world's first [[Green party]], the [[United Tasmania Group]].<ref name="Lake Pedder">{{cite web|url=http://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/L/Lake%20Pedder.htm|title=Lake Pedder|access-date=6 March 2010|last=Davies|first=Lynn|year=2006|publisher=Centre for Tasmanian Historical Studies|archive-date=9 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009001643/http://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/L/Lake%20Pedder.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the early 1980s the state debated the proposed [[Franklin Dam|Franklin River Dam]]. The anti-dam sentiment was shared by many Australians outside Tasmania and proved a factor in the election of the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government in 1983, which halted construction of the dam.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Reimer |first=Ashe Miriam Stobbe |date=2021-09-30 |title=Tasmanian Wilderness Society blocks dam construction (Franklin River Campaign) 1981–83 |url=https://commonslibrary.org/tasmanian-wilderness-society-blocks-dam-construction-franklin-river-campaign-1981-83/ |access-date=2024-04-06 |website=The Commons Social Change Library |language=en-AU |archive-date=4 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240104142947/https://commonslibrary.org/tasmanian-wilderness-society-blocks-dam-construction-franklin-river-campaign-1981-83/ |url-status=live }}</ref>  Since the 1980s the environmental focus has shifted to [[old growth]] logging and mining in the Tarkine region, which have both proved divisive.<ref>{{Cite web |last=McIntyre |first=Iain |date=2020-11-04 |title=Environmental Blockading in Australia and Around the World – Timeline 1974–1997 |url=https://commonslibrary.org/environmental-blockading-in-australia-and-around-the-world-timeline-1974-1997/ |access-date=2024-04-06 |website=The Commons Social Change Library |language=en-AU |archive-date=1 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231201003849/https://commonslibrary.org/environmental-blockading-in-australia-and-around-the-world-timeline-1974-1997/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The Tasmania Together process recommended an end to clear felling in high conservation old growth forests by January 2003, but was unsuccessful.

In [[1996 Tasmanian state election|1996]], the House of Assembly consisted of 35 seats with 7 seats per each of the five electorates. By the [[1998 Tasmanian state election|1998 election]], the number of seats had been reduced down to 25, or 5 per each electorate. This resulted in the reduction of the Greens' number of seats from 4 to 1, and increased the proportion of seats held by both the Labor and Liberal parties.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Baker |first1=Emily |title=Tasmanian Lower House should be increased by 10 members, report recommends |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-25/tasmania-parliament-should-be-restored-report-recommends/11998506 |newspaper=ABC News |date=25 February 2020 |access-date=1 September 2021 |archive-date=1 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210901005631/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-25/tasmania-parliament-should-be-restored-report-recommends/11998506 |url-status=live }}</ref> This was despite growth in population (five-fold since responsible government) and an increase in the voting percentage required for a majority government. There was also no public consultation, and inquiries at the time had recommended the opposite. The House of Assembly Select Committee in 2020 recommended in its report that the number should be increased again from 25 to 35, arguing that such a small representation would undermine democracy and limit the capabilities of the government. In 2010, the major party leadership had even endorsed reinstating the 35 seat number, but Liberal and Labor support was withdrawn the following year, with only the Greens keeping their commitment.<ref>{{cite web |title=HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY RESTORATION BILL Final Report |url=https://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/ctee/House/Reports/RC%20Final%20Report%20Tabled.pdf |website=Parliament of Tasmania |access-date=1 September 2021 |archive-date=26 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211026061935/https://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/ctee/House/Reports/RC%20Final%20Report%20Tabled.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Local government===
Tasmania has 29 [[Local government areas of Tasmania|local government areas]]. Local councils are responsible for functions delegated by the Tasmanian parliament, such as urban planning, road infrastructure and waste management. Council revenue comes mostly from property taxes and government grants.

As with the [[Tasmanian House of Assembly|House of Assembly]], Tasmania's local government elections use a system of multi-seat [[proportional representation]] known as [[Single transferable vote|Hare–Clark]]. Local government elections take place every four years and are conducted by the [[Tasmanian Electoral Commission]] by full [[postal ballot]]. The next local government elections will be held during October 2026.<ref>{{cite web |title=Local Government Elections Tasmania |url=https://www.tec.tas.gov.au/Local_Government_Elections/ |access-date=29 April 2022 |website=www.tec.tas.gov.au |archive-date=18 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220318180320/https://www.tec.tas.gov.au/Local_Government_Elections/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Traditionally, Tasmania's main industries have been mining (including copper, [[zinc]], [[tin]], and iron), agriculture, forestry, and [[Tourism in Tasmania|tourism]]. Tasmania is on [[Electricity sector in Australia|Australia's electrical grid]] and in the 1940s and 1950s, a hydro-industrialisation initiative was embodied in the state by [[Hydro Tasmania]]. These all have had varying fortunes over the last century and more, involved in ebbs and flows of population moving in and away dependent upon the specific requirements of the dominant industries of the time.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wQWtDwAAQBAJ&q=These+all+have+had+varying+fortunes+over+the+last+century+and+more,+involved+in+ebbs+and+flows+of+population+moving+in+and+away+dependent+upon+the+specific+requirements+of+the+dominant+industries+of+the+time&pg=PA60|title=Australia Business and Investment Opportunities Yearbook Volume 8 Tasmania Mining and Minerals|date=16 December 2016|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-4387-8388-8|language=en|access-date=3 November 2020|archive-date=24 January 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230124060631/https://books.google.com/books?id=wQWtDwAAQBAJ&q=These+all+have+had+varying+fortunes+over+the+last+century+and+more,+involved+in+ebbs+and+flows+of+population+moving+in+and+away+dependent+upon+the+specific+requirements+of+the+dominant+industries+of+the+time&pg=PA60|url-status=live}}</ref> The state also has a large number of food exporting sectors, including but not limited to seafood (such as [[salmon]], [[abalone]] and [[crayfish]]).

In the 1960s and 1970s there was a decline in traditional crops such as apples and pears,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fruitgrowerstas.com.au/industry_fgt.html |title=Industry Info page |publisher=Fruit Growers Tasmania |access-date=26 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821224809/http://www.fruitgrowerstas.com.au/industry_fgt.html |archive-date=21 August 2011 }}</ref> with other crops and industries eventually rising in their place. During the 15 years until 2010, new agricultural products such as wine, [[saffron]], [[pyrethrum]] and [[cherry|cherries]] have been fostered by the [[Tasmanian Institute of Agricultural Research]].

Favourable economic conditions throughout Australia, cheaper air fares, and two new ''Spirit of Tasmania'' ferries have all contributed to what is now a rising tourism industry.

About 1.7% of the Tasmanian population are employed by local government.<ref>{{cite book|title=Local Government and Southern Tasmanian Economy|author=Eslaka, Saul |date=August 2011}}</ref> Other major employers include [[Nyrstar]], [[Norske Skog]], Grange Resources, [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Major employers campaign to boost their public profile|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/major-employers-campaign-to-boost-their-public-profile/story-fnj4f7k1-1226765643507|access-date=4 April 2015|publisher=The Mercury|date=22 November 2013|archive-date=10 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410001953/http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/major-employers-campaign-to-boost-their-public-profile/story-fnj4f7k1-1226765643507|url-status=dead}}</ref> the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hobart]], and [[Federal Group]]. Small business is a large part of the community life, including [[Incat]], [[Moorilla Estate]] and [[Tassal]]. In the late 1990s, a number of national companies based their call centres in the state after obtaining cheap access to broad-band fibre optic connections.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hingst|first=Raymond D.|date=2004|title=Call centres, recent history – where have they come from and how did they get here?|url=https://eprints.usq.edu.au/6861/|journal=Proceedings of the 2nd National Call Centre Research Conference|location=Melbourne, Australia|publisher=Monash University, Institute for Regional Studies|access-date=23 February 2019|archive-date=24 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224062726/https://eprints.usq.edu.au/6861/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

The French [[Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux|D'Entrecasteaux]] Expedition of 1792–93 had anchored twice during its search of the missing [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse|La Pérouse]] in the [[Recherche Bay|Baie de la Recherche (Recherche Bay)]] in far-south Tasmania. During their stay, the crew took [[Botany|botanical]], [[Astronomy|astronomical]], and [[Earth's magnetic field|geomagnetic]] observations which were the first of their kind performed on Australian soil.

===Cinema===
{{See also|List of films shot in Tasmania|Category:Television shows set in Tasmania}}
Films set in Tasmania include ''[[Young Einstein]]'', ''[[The Tale of Ruby Rose]]'', ''[[The Hunter (2011 Australian film)|The Hunter]]'', ''[[The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce]]'', ''Arctic Blast'', ''[[Manganinnie]]'' (with music composed by [[Peter Sculthorpe]]), ''[[Van Diemen's Land (film)|Van Diemen's Land]]'', ''[[Lion (2016 film)|Lion]]'', and ''[[The Nightingale (2018 film)|The Nightingale]]''. Common within [[Australian cinema]], the Tasmanian landscape is a focal point in most of their feature film productions. ''The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce'' and ''Van Diemen's Land'' are both set during an episode of Tasmania's convict history. Tasmanian film production goes as far back as the [[silent era]], with the epic ''[[For the Term of His Natural Life (1927 film)|For The Term of His Natural Life]]'' in 1927 being the most expensive feature film made on Australian shores. ''[[The Kettering Incident]]'', filmed in and around [[Kettering, Tasmania]], won the 2016 AACTA Award for Best Telefeature or Miniseries. The [[Nature documentary|documentary series]] ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'' was partly filmed in Tasmania due to its terrain.

The [[Tasmanian Film Corporation]], which financed ''[[Manganinnie]]'', was the successor to the Tasmanian Government Department of Film Production but disappeared after privatisation. Its role is now filled by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], Screen Tasmania, and private ventures such as Blue Rocket Productions.

Tasmania's non-Aboriginal cuisine has a unique history to mainland Australia. It has developed through many subsequent waves of immigration. Tasmanian traditional foods include scallop pies – a pie filled with scallops in curry – and curry powder, which was popularised by [[Keen's|Keen's Curry]] in the 19th century.<ref>{{cite news |title=Favouring curry a long-time Tasmanian trait |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-24/tasmanians-have-been-keen-for-curry-since-colonial-days/9563024 |access-date=11 September 2021 |work=www.abc.net.au |publisher=ABC |date=23 March 2018 |language=en-AU |archive-date=11 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210911190257/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-24/tasmanians-have-been-keen-for-curry-since-colonial-days/9563024 |url-status=live }}</ref> Tasmania also produces and consumes wasabi, saffron, truffles and leatherwood honey.<ref>{{cite web |title=Top ten Tasmanian food specialities |url=http://www.tasmaniatopten.com/lists/tasmanian_foods.php |website=www.tasmaniatopten.com |access-date=11 September 2021 |archive-date=12 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210812044019/http://www.tasmaniatopten.com/lists/tasmanian_foods.php |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Cascade Brewery 1.jpg|thumb|Built in Hobart in 1824, [[Cascade Brewery]] is Australia's oldest continuously operating brewery.]]
Tasmania now has a wide range of restaurants, in part due to the arrival of immigrants and changing cultural patterns. Scattered across Tasmania are many vineyards,<ref name="goway">{{cite web|title=Tasmania Tours, Vacation Packages & Travel Experiences|url=https://www.goway.com/trips/dest/australia-and-south-pacific/cntry/australia/st/tasmania/|access-date=10 January 2022|website=Goway Travel|language=en|archive-date=10 January 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220110002722/https://www.goway.com/trips/dest/australia-and-south-pacific/cntry/australia/st/tasmania/|url-status=live}}</ref> and Tasmanian beer brands such as [[Boags]] and [[Cascade Brewery|Cascade]] are known and sold in Mainland Australia. [[King Island (Tasmania)|King Island]] off the northwestern coast of Tasmania has a reputation for boutique cheeses<ref name="goway"/> and dairy products.

===Events===
{{Main|List of events in Tasmania}}

To foster tourism, the state government encourages or supports several annual events in and around the island. The best known of these is the [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]], starting on [[Boxing Day]] in Sydney and usually arriving at [[Constitution Dock]] in Hobart around three to four days later, during the [[Taste of Tasmania]], an annual food and wine festival. Other events include the [[Targa Tasmania]] [[rallying|rally]] which attracts rally drivers from around the world and is staged all over the state, over five days. Rural or regional events include [[Agfest]], a three-day [[agricultural show]] held at [[Carrick, Tasmania|Carrick]] (just west of Launceston) in early May and [[NASA]] supported TastroFest – Tasmania's Astronomy Festival, held early August in [[Ulverstone, Tasmania|Ulverstone]] (Northwest Tasmania). The [[Royal Hobart Show]] and [[Royal Launceston Show]] are both held in October annually.

Music events held in Tasmania include the [[Falls Festival]] at [[Marion Bay, Tasmania|Marion Bay]] (a [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] event now held in both Victoria and Tasmania on New Year's Eve); the Festival of Voices, a national celebration of song held each year in Hobart attracting international and national teachers and choirs in the heart of Winter; and [[MS Fest]], a charity music event held in Launceston to raise money for those with [[multiple sclerosis]]. The [[Cygnet Folk Festival]] is one of Australia's most iconic [[folk music]] festivals and is held in [[Cygnet, Tasmania|Cygnet]] in the [[Huon Valley]] every year in January.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cygnetfolkfestival.org/ |title=Home |website=Cygnet Folk Festival |access-date=5 September 2021 |archive-date=5 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210905111031/https://www.cygnetfolkfestival.org/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The Tasmanian Lute Festival is an early music event held in different locations in Tasmania every two years. Recent additions to the state arts events calendar include the [[10 Days on the Island]] arts festival, [[MONA FOMA]], run by [[David Walsh (art collector)|David Walsh]] and curated by [[Brian Ritchie]] and [[Dark Mofo]] also run by [[David Walsh (art collector)|David Walsh]] and curated by Leigh Carmichael.

[[The Unconformity]] is a three-day festival held every two years in [[Queenstown, Tasmania|Queenstown]] on the [[West Coast of Tasmania|West Coast]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://theunconformity.com.au/ |title=Home |website=The Unconformity |access-date=5 September 2021 |archive-date=5 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210905111030/https://theunconformity.com.au/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Unconformity |url=https://www.discovertasmania.com.au/event/theunconformity |website=Discover Tasmania |access-date=5 September 2021 |archive-date=5 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210905111030/https://www.discovertasmania.com.au/event/theunconformity |url-status=live }}</ref> Each February in [[Evandale, Tasmania|Evandale]] a [[penny-farthing]] championships are held.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is the National Penny Farthing Championship? |url=https://www.evandaletasmania.com/national-penny-farthing-championship.html |website=Evandale Tasmania |access-date=5 September 2021 |archive-date=5 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210905111031/https://www.evandaletasmania.com/national-penny-farthing-championship.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Perception within Australia===
Tasmania is perceived within Australia and internationally as an island with pristine wildlife, water and air. It is known for its [[ecotourism]] for these reasons, and is considered an idyllic location for Australians considering a "tree-" or "sea-change", or are seeking [[retirement]] because of Tasmania's [[Temperate climate|temperate environment]] and friendly locals.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Spears |first1=Fran |title='From incredible scenery to friendly locals: Tasmania is unlike anywhere else' |url=https://startsat60.com/media/travel/travel-bloggers/from-incredible-scenery-to-friendly-locals-tasmania-is-unlike-anywhere-else |website=startsat60 |date=15 August 2020 |access-date=11 October 2021 |archive-date=27 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211027183336/https://startsat60.com/media/travel/travel-bloggers/from-incredible-scenery-to-friendly-locals-tasmania-is-unlike-anywhere-else |url-status=live }}</ref> In other parts of the world, Tasmania is considered as the opposite side of the planet to most places, and supposedly home to mythically exotic animals, such as the [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]] as popularised by [[Warner Brothers]].

====Stereotypes====
Tasmania has a reputation within Australia that is often at odds with the reality of the state or may have only been true during colonial times and has only persevered on the Australian mainland as a [[myth]]. Because of these [[stereotypes]], Tasmania is often referred to as the primary target (i.e., "butt") of mainland Australian jokes.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hollie |first1=Pamela G. |title=TASMANIANS WEARY OF BEING THE BUTT OF JOKES |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/26/world/tasmanians-weary-of-being-the-butt-of-jokes.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=13 October 2021 |date=26 November 1982 |archive-date=29 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211029173203/https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/26/world/tasmanians-weary-of-being-the-butt-of-jokes.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In more recent times, references to insults against Tasmania are more [[Sarcasm|sarcastic]] and jovial, but angst against the island still exists. The most commonly cited sarcastic comment is on the supposedly '[[Polycephaly|two-headed]]' Tasmanians, which originated due to some colonists developing [[goitre]]s from the low amount of [[iodine]] in the island's soil.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cooper |first1=Erin |title=What is the origin of the joke about Tasmanians having two heads? |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-13/curious-hobart-origin-of-two-headed-tasmanian-myth/11197982 |access-date=1 October 2021 |agency=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=13 June 2019 |archive-date=1 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211001205127/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-13/curious-hobart-origin-of-two-headed-tasmanian-myth/11197982 |url-status=live }}</ref> But as Tasmania receives higher volumes of inter-state tourists, the perceptions are in the process of changing.<ref>{{cite web |title=Motivations Research – Appeal triggers and motivations for tourism in Tasmania, March 2011 |url=https://www.tourismtasmania.com.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/54599/motivations.pdf |website=Tourism Tasmania |publisher=Tasmanian Government |access-date=11 October 2021 |archive-date=29 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211029174959/https://www.tourismtasmania.com.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/54599/motivations.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

The most prominent example of negative stereotype is of [[inbreeding]] due to the relatively small size of Tasmania compared to the rest of Australia (though Tasmania is nearly as large as the Republic of Ireland in area, and more populous than [[Iceland]]). This is untrue and if it had once been the case, it would have existed in the rest of colonial Australia as well, though Tasmania's penal establishments were some of the harshest in the entire colony and home to infamous bushrangers. This is a part of the also-receding global stereotype that all Australians are or were derived from criminals, even as most [[Convicts in Australia|convicts]] were transported for petty crimes. During this period of European settlement, Tasmania was the second centre of power (and a significant port of the [[British Empire]]) on the continent after [[New South Wales]], before being surpassed in the latter half of the 19th century by [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and regions sustained by [[Australian gold rushes|mining booms]] following the cessation of transportation in 1853.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cessation of Transportation |url=https://www.femaleconvicts.org.au/administration/cessation-of-transportation |website=Female Convicts Research Centre Inc. |access-date=11 October 2021 |archive-date=20 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211020061002/https://femaleconvicts.org.au/administration/cessation-of-transportation |url-status=live }}</ref>
A mentality developed in certain corners of Australia, and led to a general dislike of Tasmania amongst these people, even if the opinion-holder had never properly visited. It can rise to such an extent as to argue for the secession of Tasmania from the rest of Australia, in an effort to 'recover' Australia's reputation from Tasmania.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Alexander |first1=Alison |title=TASMANIA'S REPUTATION |url=https://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/T/Tas%20reputation.htm |website=(UTAS) The Companion to Tasmanian History |publisher=University of Tasmania |access-date=1 October 2021 |archive-date=1 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211001205132/https://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/T/Tas%20reputation.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Transport==
{{Further|Transport in Australia}}
[[File:HobartAirportTerminal.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hobart Airport]]]]

===Air===
Tasmania's main air carriers are [[Jetstar]] and [[Virgin Australia]]; [[Qantas]] and  [[QantasLink]]. These airlines fly direct routes to [[Brisbane Airport|Brisbane]], [[Melbourne Airport|Melbourne]] and [[Sydney Airport|Sydney]]. Major airports include [[Hobart Airport]] and [[Launceston Airport]]; the smaller airports, [[Burnie Airport|Burnie]] (Wynyard) and [[King Island Airport|King Island]], serviced by Rex Airlines; and [[Devonport Airport|Devonport]], serviced by QantasLink; have services to Melbourne. Intra-Tasmanian air services are offered by [[Airlines of Tasmania]]. Until 2001 [[Ansett Australia]] operated majorly out of Tasmania to 12 destinations nationwide. Tourism-related air travel is also represented in Tasmania, such as in the [[Airlines of Tasmania|Par Avion]] route between [[Cambridge Aerodrome]] near Hobart to [[Melaleuca, Tasmania|Melaleuca]] in [[Southwest National Park]].

===Antarctica base===
Tasmania – Hobart in particular – serves as Australia's chief sea link to Antarctica, with the [[Australian Antarctic Division]] located in [[Kingston, Tasmania|Kingston]]. Hobart is also the home port of the French ship ''l'Astrolabe'', which makes regular supply runs to the [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands|French Southern Territories]] near and in Antarctica.

===Road===
[[File:Bridgewater Bridge, Tasmania.jpg|thumb|[[Bridgewater Bridge (Tasmania)|Bridgewater Bridge]]]]
Within the state, the primary form of transport is by road. Since the 1980s, many of the [[List of highways in Tasmania|state's highways]] have undergone regular upgrades. These include the Hobart [[Southern Outlet, Hobart|Southern Outlet]], Launceston Southern Outlet, [[Bass Highway (Tasmania)|Bass Highway]] reconstruction, and the [[Huon Highway]]. Public transport is provided by [[Metro Tasmania]] bus services, regular taxis and Hobart only<ref>{{cite web |title=Drive or Ride with Uber in Hobart {{!}} Uber |url=https://www.uber.com/en-AU/cities/hobart/ |website=www.uber.com |access-date=18 January 2018 |archive-date=18 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118181126/https://www.uber.com/en-AU/cities/hobart/ |url-status=live }}</ref> UBER ride-share services within urban areas, with [[Redline Coaches]], [[Tassielink Transit]] and Callows Coaches providing bus service between population centres.
[[File:West Coast Wilderness Railway (4754055363).jpg|thumb|left|The [[West Coast Wilderness Railway]] runs from [[Queenstown, Tasmania|Queenstown]] to [[Strahan, Tasmania|Strahan]] and is a reminder of the once elaborate network of rail in Tasmania.]]

===Rail===
{{Main article|Rail transport in Tasmania}}
[[Rail transport in Tasmania]] consists of narrow-gauge lines to all four major population centres and to mining and forestry operations on the west coast and in the northwest. Services are operated by [[TasRail (2009)|TasRail]]. Regular passenger train services in the state ceased in 1977; the only scheduled trains are for freight, but there are tourist trains in specific areas, for example the [[West Coast Wilderness Railway]]. There is an [[Riverline|ongoing proposal]] to reinstate commuter trains to Hobart. This idea however lacks political motivation.

===Shipping===
{{See also|Bass Strait Ferries}}
[[File:Spirit of Tasmania Port Melbourne.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[MS Spirit of Tasmania II|Spirit of Tasmania]]'' links the island with mainland Australia.]]

There is a substantial amount of commercial and recreational shipping within Hobart's harbour, and the port hosts approximately 120 cruise ships during the warmer half of the year, and there are occasional visits from military vessels.<ref name="dpacmr">{{cite web |last1=Rockliff |first1=Jeremy |title=TasPorts continues to deliver strong results |url=http://www.premier.tas.gov.au/releases/tasports_continues_to_deliver_strong_results |publisher=Premier of Tasmania |access-date=24 December 2019 |archive-date=21 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201021044400/http://www.premier.tas.gov.au/releases/tasports_continues_to_deliver_strong_results |url-status=live }}</ref>

Burnie and Devonport on the northwest coast host ports and several other coastal towns host either small fishing ports or substantial marinas. The domestic sea route between Tasmania and the mainland is serviced by [[Bass Strait]] passenger/vehicle ferries operated by the Tasmanian government-owned [[TT-Line Company|TT-Line]]. The state is also home to [[Incat]], a manufacturer of very high-speed aluminium catamarans that regularly broke records when they were first launched.
