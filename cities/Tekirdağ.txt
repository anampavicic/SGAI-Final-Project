'''Tekirdağ''' ({{IPA|tr|teˈciɾdaː|pron}}) is a city in [[Turkey]]. It is located on the north coast of the [[Sea of Marmara]], in the region of [[East Thrace]]. The city forms the urban part of the [[Süleymanpaşa]] district, with a population of 186,421 in 2022.<ref name=citypop/>

Tekirdağ is a commercial centre with a harbour for agricultural products (the harbour is being expanded to accommodate a new rail link to the main freight line through Thrace). It is also home to Martas and the [[BOTAŞ]] Terminal, both of them important for trade activities in the [[Marmara Region]]. The town's best known product remains Tekirdağ rakı although it is also known for its cherries, celebrated with a festival every June.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tekirdag Festivals - Tekirdag Annual Events. |url=https://www.tekirdag.com/v/festivals/ |access-date=2022-09-30 |website=www.tekirdag.com}}</ref>

The proximity of the Greek and Bulgarian borders means that there are honorary consulates for both countries in Tekirdağ.

Ferries from Tekirdağ sail to the nearby [[Marmara Archipelago|Marmara Islands]] during the summer.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ferry Services Istanbul & Sea of Marmara, Turkey |url=https://turkeytravelplanner.com/trans/Ship/MarmaraFerries.html |access-date=2022-09-30 |website=turkeytravelplanner.com}}</ref>

The nearest airport is [[Tekirdağ Çorlu Airport]] (TEQ) although there are many more flights to [[Istanbul Airport]] (IST).

==Names and etymology==
{{see also|Names of Tekirdağ in different languages}}
Tekirdağ was called '''Bisanthe''' or '''Bysanthe''' ({{langx|el|Βισάνθη/Βυσάνθη}}),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=745BAAAAcAAJ&q=bysanthe&pg=PA547|title=A System of Geography, Ancient and Modern|work=google.gr|last1=Playfair|first1=James|year=1812}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/hellenicabooksi00xenogoog/hellenicabooksi00xenogoog_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Hellenica; Books I-II"|work=archive.org|year=1888 }}</ref> and also '''Rhaedestus''' (Ῥαιδεστός) in classical antiquity. The latter name was used until the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine era]],<ref>See: Warren Treadgold, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GBVvBAAAQBAJ&dq=Rhaedestus&pg=PT250 The Middle Byzantine Historians] (Palgrave Macmillan, 2013)</ref> and transformed into ''Rodosçuk'' after it fell to the Ottomans in the 14th century (in western languages it is usually rendered as '''Rodosto'''). After the 18th century it was called '''Tekfurdağı''', based on the Turkish word ''[[tekfur]]'', meaning "Byzantine lord". In time, the name mutated into the Turkish ''Tekirdağ'', and this became the official name under the Turkish Republic. The historical name "Rhaedestos" (transcribed also as Raidestos) is still used in the Greek Orthodox ecclesiastical context (e.g. the Bishop of Raidestos,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ec-patr.net/en/psaltai/raidestinos1.htm|title=Ecumenical Patriarchate – George Raidestinos I|work=ec-patr.net}}</ref> the Metropolitanate of Heraclia and Raidestos).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLWqXrW2X-8C&q=from+raidestos&pg=PA58|title=The Ecumenical Patriarchate|via=google.gr|isbn=9781434458766|last1=Kiminas|first1=Demetrius|date=March 2009|publisher=Wildside Press LLC }}</ref>

{{main|Bisanthe}}
The history of the city of Tekirdağ dates back to around [[4000&nbsp;BC]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.tekirdag.bel.tr/tarihce.asp| title = History of Tekirdağ| access-date =  22 March 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070206132354/http://www.tekirdag.bel.tr/tarihce.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 6 February 2007}}</ref> In [[Xenophon]]'s ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' it is mentioned as part of the kingdom of the [[Thrace|Thracian]] king [[Seuthes II|Seuthes]]. It is also mentioned as Bisanthe by Herodotus (VII, 137). The city was a [[Samos|Samian]] colony.<ref>{{cite book| last = Scott| first = Lionel | title = Historical Commentary on Herodotus| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WSo_DwAAQBAJ| publisher = BRILL|date=July 2017| page = 160| doi = 10.1163/9789047407980| isbn = 978-90-47-40798-0}}</ref>

[[Procopius]] chronicled the town's restoration by [[Justinian I]] in the 6th century AD. In 813 and again in 1206, after the [[Battle of Rodosto]], it was sacked by the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]], but it continued to appear as a place of considerable importance in later [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times.  The 11th-century Byzantine historian [[Michael Attaleiates]] owned property in Raidestos which he described in his will. From 1204 to 1235 the town was ruled by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] following the [[Latin occupation]] of [[Constantinople]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]].

In the Ottoman period the city was successively a part of the [[Rumelia Eyalet]], then of the [[Eyalet of the Archipelago|Province]] of the [[Kapudan Pasha]], the [[Silistra Eyalet]], and [[Edirne Vilayet]]. After 1849 it became the seat of the [[Sanjak of Tekfürtaği]].

=== Twentieth century ===
Tekirdağ was occupied twice by the Russian army: firstly, on 22 August 1829 during [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)]]<ref>https://tez.yok.gov.tr/UlusalTezMerkezi/TezGoster?key=WBc656i315e2eV6-EZV1ogoKkXx2Z6eCeqskADWmfHFDzY2EQsaUQYdI1d0xFuwT Ahıska Türkleri (1800–1821), Unpublished Doctoral Thesis, page 189, 2015</ref> and then on 1 February 1878 during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]].<ref>{{cite thesis|author1=Nurgül Kutlu|title=Rus kaynaklarına göre 1877-1878 Osmanlı Rus Harbi|location=Dicle University|degree=MA|year=2019
|url=https://acikerisim.dicle.edu.tr/xmlui/handle/11468/4685}}</ref> After these wars, the city returned to Ottoman rule.

In 1905, the city had a population of about 35,000, of whom about half were [[Greeks]].<ref>Volume V23, Page 448 of the ''[[s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]]''</ref>

Tekirdağ was occupied by the Bulgarian army on 11 November 1912.<ref>[https://www.msb.gov.tr/Content/Upload/Docs/askeritariharsiv/balkan_harbi_kronoloji.pdf Balkan Harbi Kronolojisi (″Chronology of Balkan War″)], page 61</ref> The city was liberated on 13 July 1913.

Finally, Tekirdağ was occupied by the Greek army on 20 July 1920 during the [[Turkish War of Independence|Turkish War of Independence (1919–1922)]]. After the signing of the [[Armistice of Mudanya]], the city was given back to Turkey on 13 November 1922.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tekirdag.gov.tr/tekirdag-tarihi|title=Tekirdağ Tarihi|access-date=13 December 2022}}</ref> Under the terms of the 1923 agreement for the [[Exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey|Exchange of Greek Orthodox and Muslim Populations]] between the two countries, the Greek Christians of Tekirdağ were all forced to leave (founding the village of [[Nea Raidestos]]), their place taken by Muslim Turks from Greece.

In December 1934, a convoy of 1,583 Turkish speaking Muslims from [[Dobruja]] and [[Ada Kaleh]] settled in Tekirdağ.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Önder Duman |title=Atatürk Döneminde Romanya'dan Türk Göçleri (1923-1938) |journal=Bilig |date=Spring 2008 |issue=45 |url=https://atif.sobiad.com/index.jsp?modul=makale-detay&Alan=sosyal&Id=AWf30j0PHDbCZb_mRETc |ref=tr}}</ref>

For many years Tekirdağ served as a depot for the produce of [[Edirne]] province. However, its trade suffered badly when [[Alexandroupolis]] became the terminus of the railway up the river [[Maritsa]].

===Bishopric===
'''Rhaedestus''' remains a [[titular see]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].<ref>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/d2r23.html Rhaedestus] At catholic-hierarchy.org.</ref> However, [[Roman Catholic Church]] activity has long ceased.

Between Tekirdağ and [[Şarköy]] is another mountain, Ganos Dağı.

==Climate==
Tekirdağ has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa'', [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Cs''). Summers are hot and humid whilst winters are cool and wet. [[Snowfall]] is somewhat common, with a week or two of snow between the months of December and March.

==Tekirdağ today==

[[File:Tekirdağ_Sahil..._-_panoramio.jpg|thumbnail|right|Tekirdağ coastline]]
The Tekirdağ area is the site of many holiday homes, as the city is only two hours drive from [[Istanbul]] via a new four-lane highway. The villages of [[Şarköy]], Mürefte and Kumbağ are particularly popular with Turkish tourists. The Marmara Sea is polluted but there are still a number of public beaches near Tekirdağ, especially the [[Yeniçiftlik]] beaches.

Most Ottoman wooden buildings have been replaced by concrete apartment blocks although some are being restored or replaced with attractive replicas. Except for the , and the narrow streets that help one imagine life in the Ottoman period, the city lacks antique charm. One reason to visit is the local delicacy, the small spicy cylindrical grilled meatballs called ''[[köfte|Tekirdağ köftesi]]'', traditionally followed by courses of a sweet local cheese and [[semolina pudding]].

The inland parts of Tekirdağ province offer fertile farmland suitable for winter wheat, sunflowers, cherries and grapes for wine-making.

Both the east–west highway (the Via Egnatia of Roman times) and the highway north toward Muratlı and Lüleburgaz are four lanes. There is a prison next to the ''rakı'' distillery and another north of the city on the road to Muratlı.

On the eastern edge of the city is the [[Namık Kemal University]], founded in 2006, which has three faculties.

=== Tekirdağ ''rakı'' ===
This part of Turkey is well known for its high quality ''[[Raki (alcoholic beverage)|rakı]]''. State-owned until the 1990s, the distilleries are now in private hands and the wine and ''rakı'' industries are undergoing a renewal despite being hampered by high taxation on alcohol.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-05-31 |title=Tekirdag Raki {{!}} Sarap.Online Turkish Wines and Spirits |url=https://sarap.online/en/raki/tekirdag-raki/ |access-date=2022-09-30 |language=en}}</ref>
