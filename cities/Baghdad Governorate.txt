'''Baghdad Governorate''' ({{langx|ar|محافظة بغداد}} ''Muḥāfaẓät Baġdād''), also known as the '''Baghdad Province''', is the capital [[governorates of Iraq|governorate]] of [[Iraq]]. It includes the capital [[Baghdad]] as well as the surrounding [[metropolitan area]]. The governorate is one of two small provinces of all 19 in Iraq into which the country divides entirely, yet by a margin of almost three-to-one, the most populous.

== Description ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2023}}
Baghdad Governorate is one of the most developed parts of Iraq, with better infrastructure than much of Iraq, though heavily damaged from the US-led invasion in 2003 and continuing violence during the [[Iraq War]]. It used to have one of the highest rates for terrorism in the world with suicide bombers, however terrorist attacks have been rare since the territorial defeat of [[ISIL]] in Iraq in late 2017.

Baghdad has at least 12 bridges spanning the [[Tigris]] river - joining the east and west of the city. The governorate's northeast includes multiple [[Mesopotamian Marshes]].

The [[Sadr City]] district is the most densely populated area in Iraq.

== Province administration ==
{{See also|Government of Baghdad}}
Baghdad is governed by the Baghdad Provincial Council. Representatives to the Baghdad Provincial Council were elected by their peers from the lower councils of the [[administrative districts in Baghdad]] in numbers proportional to the population of the various districts that were represented.
