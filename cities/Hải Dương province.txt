'''Hải Dương''' is a [[Provinces of Vietnam|province]] in the [[Red River Delta]] of northern [[Vietnam]]. Its name derives from [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] {{vi-nom|{{linktext|海|陽}}}} "ocean sun", though the modern province is in fact landlocked. Located in the [[Northern Vietnam key economic region|Northern Key Economic Region]], Hai Duong Province has a dynamic economy with a focus on industrial manufacturing.<ref name="auto">[https://moit.gov.vn/en/news/industry-and-trade/hai-duong-province-prioritizes-supporting-industry-development.html Hai Duong Province prioritizes supporting industry development]</ref>

==Name==
''Hải Dương'' is [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] for "ocean sun" ([[wikt:海|海]][[wikt:陽|陽]]). The name first appeared officially in 1498.<ref>[https://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~duc/sach/dvsktt/dvsktt17b.html Đại Việt Sử ký Toàn thư: Bản kỷ thực lục. Quyển XII. Kỷ Nhà Lê: Thánh Tông Thuần Hoàng Đế]</ref> In feudal times, Hải Dương indicated a vast area from east of [[Hanoi]] to the [[South China Sea]]. The area corresponded to all of modern Hải Dương, [[Hải Phòng]], most of [[Hưng Yên province|Hưng Yên]] and the southwestern corner of [[Quảng Ninh]].

==Geography==
The province is located in the [[Red River Delta]] of north-eastern Vietnam, about mid-distance from [[Hanoi]] to [[Haiphong]]. Two famous pagodas, Côn Sơn and Kiếp Bạc, are situated in this province. The province is known for its [[lychees]] and for the traditional sweet ''bánh đậu xanh'' ([[mung bean]] paste).

Hải Dương is located in the center of North Vietnam. The natural area of the province is {{Convert|1668.28|km2|mi2|abbr=on}},<ref name="area_2022"/> the 51st largest in Vietnam. Hải Dương province borders six provinces: [[Bắc Ninh Province|Bắc Ninh]], [[Bắc Giang Province|Bắc Giang]] and [[Quảng Ninh Province|Quảng Ninh]] in the north; [[Hưng Yên Province|Hưng Yên]] in the west; [[Haiphong|Hải Phòng]] in the east; and [[Thái Bình Province|Thái Bình]] to the south.

There are important roads and railways running through the province, including Highways No. 5, No. 18, No. 183 and No. 37.

==Administrative divisions==
Hải Dương is subdivided into 12 district-level sub-divisions:

{{div col|colwidth=}}
* 9 districts:
** [[Bình Giang District|Bình Giang]]
** [[Cẩm Giàng District|Cẩm Giàng]]
** [[Gia Lộc District|Gia Lộc]]
** [[Kim Thành District|Kim Thành]]
** [[Nam Sách District|Nam Sách]]
** [[Ninh Giang District|Ninh Giang]]
** [[Thanh Hà District|Thanh Hà]]
** [[Thanh Miện District|Thanh Miện]]
** [[Tứ Kỳ District|Tứ Kỳ]]
* 1 district-level town:
** [[Kinh Môn]]
* 2 provincial cities:
** [[Chí Linh]]
** [[Hải Dương]] (capital)
{{div col end}}

They are further subdivided into 13 commune-level towns (or townlets), 227 communes, and 25 wards.

==Climate==
*Hải Dương has a tropical monsoon climate with typical cold winter, potential heat and high humidity. The prevailing winds come from the southeast and northeast. The climate is divided into four distinct seasons. From early February to early April, there is a transition period between the dry and wet seasons in which there is spray and rain. The rainy season lasts from April to October.
*The annual average rainfall is between {{convert|1300|mm|in}} and {{convert|1700|mm|in}}.
*The average temperature 23.3&nbsp;°C.
*The average amount of sunshine annually is 1,524 hours.
*The average relative humidity is between 85 and 87%.

==Demography==
* Over the last 20 years,{{when|date=November 2017}} Hải Dương province has been experiencing a big change in its demographics. During this period, the rate of fertility decreased dramatically from a high rate at 6.7% to 2.14% between 2000 and 2008. The same pattern is found with the mortality rate. This is a result of the success of the family planning program and the improvement of the health care system in the province as well as innovations in medicine. In addition, life expectancy also increased over time. These changes have taken place at a speed that is much quicker than the world average rate and the rate of many other places in Asia.
* The number of persons aged 60 years or older in Hải Dương province is estimated to be 600,000 in 2010. This number is projected to grow to nearly 800,000 by 2050, at which time it will be equal to the population of children under 15. This historic crossover of an increasing share of older persons and a declining share of children will mark the first time that the number of children and older persons are the same.
* There are many ethnic groups of which the [[Vietnamese people|Kinh]] make up 99% of the population. Major religions include [[Buddhism in Vietnam|Buddhism]], [[Catholic Church in Vietnam|Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism in Vietnam|Protestantism]] of Christianity, [[Confucianism]], [[Caodaism]] and the [[Hòa Hảo]] faith. With that being said, [[veneration of the dead|ancestor worship]] is probably the predominant "religion", although they may not realize it.{{clarify|date=November 2017}}

==History==
[[File:Province de Hai-Duong (1909).jpg|thumb|left|Map of Hai Duong province in 1909]]

Currently there are many families living here but the cost of land and the cost of building the homes is quite high in comparison with living standard in Hải Dương.

==Public health==
Hải Dương was one of the first six provinces in Vietnam to construct a public safety program for children. A public safety site for children was constructed in Đức Chính village, Cẩm Giàng district. As the injury/accident rate amongst children had decreased significantly after only one year, this experimental trial project seems to have had a positive impact.

Hải Dương city has a public general hospital on Nguyễn Lương Bằng street.

==Transportation==
12 year ago (1997), nobody in Hải Dương province believed that the agricultural products of Hải Dương Province, after a few hours of being transported, could be readied for sale in Hanoi. Nowadays, however, it only takes about one hour to go to Hanoi from Hải Dương. This big change is due to the outstanding development in the traffic network.
*In fact, transport in Hải Dương province developed very fast. During the last 5 years, the whole land transportation in Hải Dương was upgraded and improved with various projects. In 1999, the National Road No. 5 connecting Hanoi and Haiphong was upgraded to first-class status.
*Today, there are 649&nbsp;km of roads under the central management including National Road Nos. 5, 18, 183 and 37 that have been completely built or upgraded. These roads are favorable for traveling and goods transportation within the Hải Dương province. Furthermore, there are 11 provincial asphalt land routes with a total length of 258&nbsp;km and 27 land routes at district level with a total length of 352&nbsp;km, of which 70% have been asphalt.
*Hải Dương has 10 waterways with a total length of nearly 300&nbsp;km under the central management and six waterways with a total length of 140&nbsp;km under local management. However, most of the transport operations on these waterways have not been planned yet.
*Hải Dương also has 70&nbsp;km of railway (including 15&nbsp;km of railways serving for the Phả Lại company)

==Media, culture, and entertainment==
At present, Hải Dương has one provincial newspaper, publishing daily, weekend, and monthly editions. There are additional magazines published by different departments of the province in related fields. E-newspapers such as at www.haiduong.gov.vn and www.truyenhinhhaiduong.com.vn have made it easier to get information about the province than ever before.

Hải Dương Provincial People's Voice and Television Broadcasting Center is known as one of the most developed in the northern region. Cable TV networks have also been installed, providing customers with more than 40 international channels.

Hải Dương is famous for being a "sacred land with pre-eminent people" with hundreds of well-known historical, cultural relics and scenic beauty areas such as Côn Sơn - Kiếp Bạc, Nguyễn Trãi Temple and Chi Lăng Nam Storks island. The province is also a place of many traditional handicraft villages with well-known products for centuries. Cultural festivals are organized annually during spring and autumn, attracting visitors from all over the nation.

Hải Dương has over 100 hotels ranging from 2 stars to 4 stars and many are motels or guest-houses. Restaurants serving traditional food can be found on almost every street in the city center, but visitors may also enjoy foreign cuisines at specialty restaurants around Bạch Đằng Lake. International restaurants are getting more popular and choices expanding, and you may find Chinese, Korean, and Japanese restaurants here.

===Cuisine===
[[Bánh đậu xanh]], a sweet mung bean cake, and [[Rượu Phú Lộc]] are local specialties.
