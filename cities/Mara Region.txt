'''Mara Region''' (''Mkoa wa Mara'' in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]) is one of [[Tanzania]]'s 31 administrative [[Regions of Tanzania|regions]]. The region covers an area of {{cvt|21,760|km2}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://Mara.go.tz/|title=Mara Region Size}}</ref> The region is comparable in size to the combined land area of the nation state of [[El Salvador]].<ref>{{Convert|21,041|km2|abbr=on}} for El Salvador at {{cite web| url=https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/countries_by_area.htm|title= Area size comparison| publisher=Nations Online| year=2022| access-date=12 October 2022}}</ref> The neighboring regions are [[Mwanza Region]] and [[Simiyu Region]] (to the south), [[Arusha Region]] (to the southeast), and [[Kagera Region]] (across [[Lake Victoria]]). The Mara Region borders Kenya (to the northeast).The regional capital is the municipality of [[Musoma]]. Mara Region is known for being the home of [[Serengeti National Park]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] site and also the birth place of Tanzania's founding father [[Julius Nyerere]]. Under [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial occupation, the Mara Region was a district called the Lake Province, which became the Lake Region after independence in 1961.{{r|Ndembwike_08}}

== Geography ==
The Mara Region is located in the northern part of mainland Tanzania. It is located between latitudes 1° 0’ and 2° 31’ and between longitudes 33° 10’ and 35° 15’. It contains 30,150 sq kilometers total, 10,584 sq kilometers of such being water area. To the north the Mara Region borders [[Uganda]] and Kenya. It is also bordered by the Arusha Region to its east, Simiyu Region to its south, as well as the Mwanza Region in the southwest and west. 15% of Lake Victoria's water body—10,854 square kilometers—is submerged in the Mara Region.{{r|Ag_cenusus08}}{{r|Mara_invGuide2020}}

=== Climate ===
The maximum temperature of the region is 29.32°C and minimum of 27.68°C, with an average of 28.50°C. The Mara Region experiences a bimodal rainfall pattern, consisting of two [[rainy seasons]] and two [[Dry season|dry seasons]]. The long rainfall period last between February until June. The short rainfall period last between September and June.{{r|Ag_cenusus08}}

The Mara Region can be divided into 3 climatic zones. The northern zone resides in the [[Tarime District]] as well as parts of the [[Serengeti District]]. On average, it receives annual rainfall of 1,250-2,000&nbsp;mm/year. The central zone includes much of Musoma District and eastern parts of Serengeti. It receives an annual rainfall of 900–1300&nbsp;mm/year. The Lowland zone covers much of Bunda and the lake shores. This zone receives 700–900&nbsp;mm/year.{{r|Mara_Profile2003}}{{r|Ag_cenusus08}}
Lake Victoria borders the Mara Region of Tanzania. The lake has a surface area 68,800 square km, and its coastline expands over 3,220&nbsp;km. It is the [[Nile]]'s principle water reservoir. Lake Victoria has numerous [[Archipelago|archipelagos]], or groups of islands. Islands found in Mara territory are numerous, in the [[Bunda District]] Council, there are Bulamba, Nafuba, Sozia, Sata, Namguma, Machwele, Ilela, Igali, Chalika, Nyakalango, Bugulani, Nachenyele, and Guyanza; in the Musoma Municipal Council, Rukuba, and Iriga; and in the Rorya District Council, Towa, Kinesi, and Bugwambwa Island. There are a plethora of over 200 species of fish, however economically [[tilapia]] and [[nile perch]] are important.{{r|Mara_Britannica}}

=== Vegetation ===
The Mara Region is mostly covered with natural vegetation, but there are also large areas of cultivation that are underutilized. The most prevalent landscape seen in the natural vegetation is the “[[Savanna|savannah]] type” most commonly found in areas that receive [[Rain|annual rainfall]] between 900 and 1200 mms/year. The [[Serengeti|Serengeti plains]] consist of savannah type vegetation with predominant forest vegetation, but mostly scattered woodlands and wooded grasslands. The northern zone, receiving high annual rainfall, is composed of the humid forest. The lowland zones with less annual rainfall consist of wooded grassland and bushland of dense thickets.{{r|Mara_Profile2003}}
14,750 sq kilometers of land is occupied by the Serengeti National Park and is located at the border of the Arusha and Mara Region. It was established in 1951, and contains the vast and astonishing concentration of plain animals left anywhere in Africa.{{r|Mara_Profile2003}}

==Economy==
[[Mining]], [[fishing]], [[tourism]], cattle raising, crop farming, and cross-border operations are the mainstays of the Mara Region's distinctive and alluring economy.<ref name="Mara_invGuide2020"/>

===Agriculture===
About 80% of the region's workforce is employed in [[agriculture]], which accounts for about 60% of the region's GDP. Cassava, rice, maize, sorghum, [[Eleusine coracana|finger-millet]], [[Bulrush Millet|bulrush millet]], sweet potatoes, potatoes, beans, [[Vigna subterranea|Bambara nuts]], ground nuts, [[Mung bean|green gram]], chickpeas, banana, cotton, coffee, sunflower, sesame, onions, tomatoes, watermelon, oranges, avocados, pawpaw, pineapples, and lemons are some of the crops grown in the area.
However, the region's critical crops include bananas, [[coffee]], cassava, [[horticulture]], and [[cotton]]. The estimated amount of [[fertile]] land in the region is 2,500,000 hectares, however only 500,000 hectares, or around 20% of the arable land, are typically used for crop production.

The Mara Region is one of the eleven cotton-growing regions in the Western Cotton Growing Area (WCGA), and when compared to other regions, it produces an average of 220 kg of cotton per acre. Mara was the pioneer of the cotton contract farming model in Tanzania.<ref name="Mara_invGuide2020"/> Out of the potential area of 22,632 hectares suited for the crop, the region is predicted to cultivate 3,065 hectares of [[Coffea arabica|Arabica coffee]]. In the Mara region, coffee is grown in four districts. These districts are [[Tarime District|Tarime]], [[Serengeti District|Serengeti]], [[Rorya District|Rorya]], and [[Butiama District|Butiama]]. Small-scale farmers, with average plot sizes of 1 acre and 800 kilograms of production per acre, are the principal producers. In Tarime District, [[tea]] is mostly farmed by small-holder farmers, who have land plots ranging from 0.2 acre to 2 acres and produce 600 kilos per acre each month. 

Air service to the Mara region is provided by [[Musoma Airport]], the airstrips at Seronera and Fort Ikoma in the Serengeti National Park, and Magena Airstrip near Tarime.<ref name="Mara_invGuide2020"/>

===Fishing===
Fishing in the Mara region is primarily done on Lake Victoria, which has 49% of its total area within Tanzanian territory. Along Lake Victoria, the Mara River, and its streams, fishing is done, with the activity rated as one of the region's top economic objectives. About 379,707 individuals are employed in fishing as a source of income, which accounts for 40% of the labor force in the area.<ref name="Mara_invGuide2020"/>
The most common methods of processing [[Sardine|sardines]] in the area include sun drying, frying, and, in rare instances, smoking. When compared to sardines from other regions, Mara Region sardines (dagaa), especially those from Kibuyi in Rorya District, are the best and have the most weight per gallon or per bucket. A monthly average catch of 3,452.25 metric tonnes is thought to be marketed both inside and beyond the Mara Region.<ref name="Mara_invGuide2020"/>

Nile perch is a valuable source of food and nourishment for families, as well as a raw material for fish processing factories. Bunda, Musoma, and Rorya districts saw a quantity of catch  locally. Fisheries in Rukuba Makoko, Nyakarango, Nafuba, Namguma, Machwera, and Sozia. Musoma Fish Processors do processing in the area in the beaches of Ryamakabe, Toa, Ngonche, Msasani, and Bugambwa. The majority of the processing of the Nile perch that is brought into the area. Roughly 72%, or 13,373.07 metric tonnes—takes place in Mwanza.<ref name="Mara_invGuide2020"/>

Village governments control 5 hectares, while the private sector is in charge of 40.4 hectares.

Ikoma Wildlife Management Area (IWMA), which spans 242.3 km2, is present in addition to the Reserves. There are many different wildlife species there. The Mara ecosystem is renowned for its yearly migration of more than 1.5 million wildebeest and 250,000 zebra.
