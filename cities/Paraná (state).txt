'''Paraná''' ({{IPA|pt-BR|paɾɐˈna|lang|Pt-br Paraná.ogg}}) is one of the 26 [[states of Brazil]], in the [[Southern Region, Brazil|south]] of the country. It is bordered in the north by [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] state, in the east by the [[Atlantic Ocean]], in the south by [[Santa Catarina state]] and the province of [[Misiones Province|Misiones]], [[Argentina]], and in the west by [[Mato Grosso do Sul]] and [[Paraguay]], with the [[Paraná River]] as its western boundary.<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Paraná (Brazil) |display=Paraná |volume=20 |page=766}}</ref> It is subdivided into [[List of municipalities in Paraná|399 municipalities]], and its capital is the city of [[Curitiba]]. Other major cities are [[Londrina]], [[Maringá]], [[Ponta Grossa]], [[Cascavel]], [[São José dos Pinhais]] and [[Foz do Iguaçu]]. The state is home to 5.4% of the Brazilian population and generates 6.2% of the Brazilian [[GDP]].

Crossed by the Tropic of Capricorn, Paraná has what is left of the [[araucaria]] forest, one of the most important subtropical forests in the world. At the border with Argentina is the [[National Park of Iguaçu]], considered by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]]. {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} from there, at the border with Paraguay, the largest dam in the world was built, the Hidroelétrica de Itaipu ([[Itaipu Dam|Itaipu Hydroelectric Dam]]).

==History==
{{Main|History of Paraná}}
Before the discovery of the region by European explorers, indigenous populations inhabited the region for thousands of years. This included the Carijó in the lands closer to the sea, from the [[Tupi people|Tupi]] group, and the [[Caingangues]] in the interior, who belonged to the [[Jê languages|Jê]] group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cidadao.pr.gov.br/modules/conteudo/conteudo.php?conteudo=77|title=Etnias - Estado do Paraná|last=CELEPAR|website=www.cidadao.pr.gov.br|language=pt-BR|access-date=2018-05-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116091519/http://www.cidadao.pr.gov.br/modules/conteudo/conteudo.php?conteudo=77|archive-date=16 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Colonisation of the state by settlers started in the 16th century, but was mainly confined to the coasts. Being a region mostly abandoned by the Portuguese,<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Grande Enciclopédia Larousse Cultural|last1=Mascarenhas|first1=Maria Amélia|last2=Biasi|first2=Mauro De|last3=Coltrinari|first3=Lylian|last4=Moraes|first4=Antônio Carlos de Robert de|publisher=Nova Cultural|year=1998|volume=18|location=São Paulo|pages=4444–4445|language=pt|chapter=Paraná}}</ref> the region was explored by other European countries, who searched primarily for [[Pau brasil]].<ref name=":0" /> The most noteworthy presence was that of the Spanish, which brought with them [[jesuit]]s. Soon, [[Jesuit reduction]]s were opened in the western and south-western parts of the state, whose territory largely belonged to the Spanish crown. In 1554, [[Domingo Martínez de Irala]] founded the town of Ontiveros, one [[League (unit)|league]] away from the [[Guaíra Falls]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encontraparana.com.br/sobre-parana.htm|title=Estado do Paraná|date=2017|website=Encontra Paraná|access-date=2018-07-31}}</ref>

In the 1940s, the northern part of the state was settled as a result of the expansion of the São Paulo coffee industry. The south-eastern part of the state was settled as a result of migration from [[Rio Grande do Sul]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/brazil/35883384.pdf|title=Supporting the Contribution of HEIs to Regional Development|publisher=Secretariat of Science, Technology and Higher Education, State of Parana|access-date=21 April 2013}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[Image:Cataratas do Iguaçu - panoramio (4).jpg|thumb|left|[[Iguazu Falls]]]]

Paraná is bounded on the north by [[São Paulo state]], on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by [[Santa Catarina state]] and the [[Misiones Province]] of Argentina, and on the west by [[Mato Grosso do Sul]] and the republic of Paraguay, with the Paraná River as its western boundary line.

The state can be separated into five main topographic areas, from east to west: a coastal zone, the mountains of [[Serra do Mar]], and then three plateaus, each lower than the other, until the [[Paraná River]] is reached.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/443044/Parana|title=Paraná|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=6 January 2013}}</ref>

Initially settled by the [[Guaraní people|Guarani]] and [[Kaingang]] [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindians]], until the 17th century, virtually no European presence existed in Paraná. The number of settlers grew around 1750 and the population was composed of Amerindians, Portuguese, and some Spaniards. African slaves from [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] were also present, but in fewer numbers than in other Brazilian areas, because Paraná was an unexplored region that did not need much slave manpower. As part of the province of São Paulo, immigration grew in the mid-19th century, mostly composed of Italian, German, Polish, Ukrainian, and Japanese peoples. While large numbers of Poles and Ukrainians are present in Paraná, their presence in the rest of Brazil is relatively small, especially Ukrainians. In the early 20th century, two waves of migration to Paraná occurred: one coming from the north, mostly of Portuguese, but also of African and Amerindian origin, and another from southern Brazil to the southwest and west, mostly of Portuguese, Italian, and German origins.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0075145| pmid=24073242| pmc=3779230|title = Revisiting the Genetic Ancestry of Brazilians Using Autosomal AIM-Indels| journal=PLOS ONE| volume=8| issue=9| pages=e75145|year = 2013|last1 = Saloum De Neves Manta|first1 = Fernanda| last2=Pereira| first2=Rui| last3=Vianna| first3=Romulo| last4=Rodolfo Beuttenmüller De Araújo| first4=Alfredo| last5=Leite Góes Gitaí| first5=Daniel| last6=Aparecida Da Silva| first6=Dayse| last7=De Vargas Wolfgramm| first7=Eldamária| last8=Da Mota Pontes| first8=Isabel| last9=Ivan Aguiar| first9=José| last10=Ozório Moraes| first10=Milton| last11=Fagundes De Carvalho| first11=Elizeu| last12=Gusmão| first12=Leonor| bibcode=2013PLoSO...875145S| doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3659/is_200008/ai_n8926589/?tag=content;col1 HLA polymorphism and evaluation of European, African, and Amerindian contribution to the white and mulatto populations from Parana, Brazil]</ref>

In 2019, Brazil produced about 900 thousand tons of [[yerba mate]] annually, according to the IBGE. Paraná is the largest producer in volume and Rio Grande do Sul in plantation areas (and where the sector is more industrialized). According to 2017 data, Paraná harvested 301 thousand tons of yerba mate by extractive method, and 237 thousand tons in plantation. The productive potential of yerba mate is still little explored in Brazil, with a good part of the harvest carried out by the extractive system and with low levels of productivity. However, many new producers are adopting more professional and efficient production systems, with technical acuity of management and globalized market vision. This tends to increase Brazil's export of this product.
