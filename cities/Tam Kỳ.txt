'''Tam Kỳ''' ({{Audio|Tam Ky.ogg|listen|help=no}}) {{airport codes|TMK}} is the capital city of [[Quảng Nam Province]], in the [[South Central Coast]] of [[Vietnam]]. As of 2019 the city had a population of 122,374.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tam Kỳ (District-level City, Quảng Nam, Vietnam) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map and Location |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/vietnam/admin/qu%E1%BA%A3ng_nam/502__tam_k%E1%BB%B3/ |access-date=2024-02-07 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Administration map of Tam Ky City, Quangnam Province.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Administration map of Tam Kỳ]]
The town was established in 1906 under the [[Nguyễn dynasty]] as an administrative and tax post.<ref>Bradley Camp Davis ''States of Banditry: The Nguyễn Government, Bandit Rule, and the culture of power in the post-Taiping China-Vietnam Borderlands'' 2008 Page 106 "unspecified bandits ransacked two tax posts, including Tam Kỳ ... Tam Kỳ returned steady revenue"</ref> During the [[Republic of Vietnam]], the city was the main base of the US military in Quảng Nam Province (what was then [[Quảng Tín]] Province) for the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]]. The North Vietnamese captured the city on March 24, 1975.

In 1997, the local government under the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] made it the capital of Quảng Nam province.<ref>{{Cite web |last=baoquangnam.vn |date=2016-08-23 |title=Tam Kỳ - từ ký ức đến hiện tại |url=https://baoquangnam.vn/tam-ky-tu-ky-uc-den-hien-tai-3102644.html |access-date=2024-05-18 |website=baoquangnam.vn |language=vi}}</ref> 

Since then, there has been substantial development within the city. Tam Kỳ city is famous for Tam Kỳ chicken rice, which is recognized nationally, and many pristine beaches. In addition, Tam Kỳ city is also famous for Tam Kỳ noodles, which is known as My Quang.
