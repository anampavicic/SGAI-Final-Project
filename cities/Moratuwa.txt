<blockquote>{{Quote box
| quote = About twelve miles ({{cvt|12|mi|km|order=flip}}) from Colombo, the chief town of Ceylon, on the high road to Galle, which is the second town, there is a belt or bar of land, lying between the sea on the one side, and, an extensive lake, or rather lagoon, on the other.  And as the sea in this quarter abounds in fish, and this lagoon has many arms leading from its ample basin into canals stretching along the coast, and into rivers, flowing from the mountains, so as to form a great harbour, the surrounding country, which is very fertile, has become very populous. On the bank of land referred to, stands the thriving village of Morotto, remarkable for its fishermen and its carpenters.
