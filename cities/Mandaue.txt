'''Mandaue''', officially the '''City of Mandaue''' ({{lang-ceb|Dakbayan sa Mandaue}}), is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] in the [[Central Visayas]] region of the [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 364,116 people.{{PH census|current}}

It is geographically located on the central-eastern coastal region of [[Cebu|Cebu]] by [[Philippine Statistics Authority]] but administratively independent from the province. Its southeast coast borders [[Mactan Island]] where [[Lapu-Lapu City]] is located and is connected to the island via two bridges: the [[Mactan-Mandaue Bridge]] and [[Marcelo Fernan Bridge]]. Mandaue is bounded on the north by the town of [[Consolacion, Cebu|Consolacion]], to the east by the [[Camotes Sea]], and to the west and south by [[Cebu City]].

It is one of three highly urbanized cities on Cebu island and forms a part of the [[Metro Cebu|Cebu Metropolitan area]]<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.cebu-philippines.net/mandaue.html| title = The brilliance of Mandaue City| work = Mandaue City| publisher = cebu-philippines.net}}</ref> and was part of the [[Legislative districts of Cebu#6th District|sixth district of Cebu]] joined with the municipalities of Consolacion and Cordova - it was qualified for a lone district since 1991. On April 5, 2019, the city became a lone legislative district.<ref name= "corrales1"/> As of June 30, 2022, Mandaue had its first representation in the [[19th Congress of the Philippines]].

== History ==

A community was established in Mandaue by a flourishing group of [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] people. The [[Venice|Venetian]] chronicler [[Antonio Pigafetta]] wrote of a settlement called "Mandaui" which existed in the area with a chieftain named Apanoaan<ref name="Discovery of sugbo by the west">{{cite book | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=eeY0ifyij6QC&q=mandani+aponoan&pg=PA288 | title = To America and Around the World: The Logs of Christopher Columbus and of ... | work = Antonio Pigafetta, Raleigh Ashlin Skelton| publisher = Branden Publishing Co.| isbn = 9780828320634 | year = 2001 }}</ref> some called him Lambuzzan in other accounts.<ref name="Lambusan chief of Mandaui">{{cite book | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=RB4usvtAZrEC&q=lambuzzan+mandaui&pg=PA84| title = Magellan's voyage: a narrative of the first circumnavigation | work = Antonio Pigafetta/ Adolph Caso| publisher = Yale University| isbn = 9780486280998 | year = 1994 }}</ref>

Mandaue natives were forced into a town as decreed by the Spanish authorities. This may have started off as a mission village (which included present day [[Consolacion]], [[Liloan, Cebu|Liloan]] and [[Poro, Cebu|Poro]]) serving as a bulwark for the church in the northern Cebu and was managed by the Jesuit in 1638 then a century later by the Recollects.<ref name="Mandaue City">{{cite web | url =http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/r7_mandaue.html| title = Mandaue| work = admu.edu.ph}}</ref>

The [[Philippine revolution|Philippine Revolution]] of 1898 gave the town a new form of administration in accordance with the organic decree of the Central Revolutionary Government. The short-lived revolution was overthrown by the American troops and a battle nearly destroyed the town in 1901, killing [[Municipal president|Presidente]] Benito Ceniza.{{sfn|Mojares|1999}}

Mandaue was a semi-autonomous functioning town. Semi-autonomous as it was still under the jurisdiction of Cebu. Despite having been developed and organized by the Spaniards throughout the ages and its population increasing as the years gone by, the Spaniards did not make an initiative to elevate the town into an independent municipality. It was only after the death of Presidente Ceniza and the establishment of American Rule in Mandaue that the dream of becoming an independent municipality came true. In 1901, Mandaue became an independent municipality.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mandauecity.gov.ph/ |title=Home |website=mandauecity.gov.ph}}</ref>

Mandaue became independent from being an American Commonwealth and a Japanese garrison on July 4, 1946, along with the entire nation.

The city is the 6th smallest government unit in terms of land area; among the Metro Cebu local government units the city is the second smallest next to the municipality of Cordova in the island of Mactan. The city's land area is only 4.5% of the total land area of Metro Cebu and less than 1% of the total land of the province of Cebu.

The North [[land reclamation|Reclamation]] Project, now known as the North Special Administrative Zone, currently has about {{convert|180|ha|abbr=on}} reclaimed land. Of the 180 hectares, about {{convert|36|ha|abbr=on}} belong to the city.

It is one of the two (the other one being the municipality of Consolacion) local government units located within the mainland Metro Cebu where the elevation of land is less than {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}}.

Many of the areas of the city are extremely flat. About 77.37% is within the 0-8% [[slope]] category. Barangays belonging to this region are Centro, Looc, South Special Administrative Zone, Cambaro, Opao, Umapad, Paknaan, Alang-alang, Tipolo, Ibabao, Guizo, Subangdaku, Mantuyong, Maguikay and Tabok. The greater portion of the city, comprising about 70%, is dominated by the Mandaue Clay Loam soil series. This is found in the 0-2% and 2-5% slope ranges. Faraon clay loam characterizes the rest of the land with slope range from 5-8% and up to 25-40%.<ref name="Land Use">{{cite web | url =http://www.mandauecity.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=69&Itemid=81| title = Land Use| work = Mandaue City| publisher = Mandaue city government}}</ref>
