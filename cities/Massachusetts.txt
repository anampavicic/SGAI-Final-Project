The first [[British colonization of the Americas|English colonizers]] in Massachusetts Bay Colony landed with Richard Vines and spent the winter in Biddeford Pool near Cape Porpoise (after 1820 the State of Maine) in 1616. The [[Puritans]], arrived at [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]] in 1620. This was the second permanent [[British colonization of the Americas|English colony]] in the part of North America that later became the United States, after the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown Colony]]. The [[Thanksgiving (United States)|"First Thanksgiving"]] was celebrated by the Puritans after their first harvest in the "[[New World]]" and lasted for three days. They were soon followed by other Puritans, who colonized the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]—now known as Boston—in 1630.{{sfn|Goldfield|Abbott|Anderson|Argersinger|1998|p=30}}

The Puritans believed the [[Church of England]] needed to be further [[Reformation|reformed]] along [[Protestant]] [[Calvinist]] lines, and experienced harassment due to the religious policies of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] and high-ranking churchmen such as [[William Laud]], who would become Charles's [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], whom they feared were re-introducing [[Ritualism in the Church of England|"Romish"]] elements to the national church.<ref name=puritans>{{cite web |title=The New England Colonies |url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/3.asp |publisher=ushistory.org |access-date=April 24, 2015}}</ref> They decided to colonize to Massachusetts, intending to establish what they considered an "ideal" religious society.{{sfn|Goldfield|Abbott|Anderson|Argersinger|1998|p=29}} The [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] was colonized under a royal charter, unlike the Plymouth colony, in 1629.<ref>{{cite web |title=Charter Of Massachusetts Bay 1629 |url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1600-1650/charter-of-massachusetts-bay-1629.php |publisher=let.rug.nl |access-date=April 24, 2015}}</ref> Both religious dissent and expansionism resulted in several new colonies being founded, shortly after Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay, elsewhere in New England.

During the 19th century, Massachusetts became a national leader in the American [[Industrial Revolution]], with factories around cities such as [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] and [[Boston]] producing textiles and shoes, and factories around Springfield producing tools, paper, and textiles.{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=129}}{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=211}} The state's economy transformed from one based primarily on agriculture to an industrial one, initially making use of water-power and later the [[steam engine]] to power factories. Canals and railroads were being used in the state for transporting raw materials and finished goods.{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=202}} At first, the new industries drew labor from [[Yankee]]s on nearby subsistence farms, though they later relied upon [[immigration to the United States|immigrant labor]] from Europe and Canada.{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|pp=133–36}}{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=179}}

Although Massachusetts was the first slave-holding colony with slavery dating back to the early 1600s, the state became a center of [[progressivism|progressivist]] and [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] (anti-slavery) activity in the years leading up to the [[American Civil War]]. [[Horace Mann]] made the state's school system a national model.{{sfn|Goldfield|Abbott|Anderson|Argersinger|1998|p=251}} [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], both [[philosopher]]s and writers from the state, also made major contributions to American philosophy.{{sfn|Goldfield|Abbott|Anderson|Argersinger|1998|p=254}} Furthermore, members of the [[transcendentalism|transcendentalist movement]] within the state emphasized the importance of the natural world and emotion to humanity.{{sfn|Goldfield|Abbott|Anderson|Argersinger|1998|p=254}}

Although significant opposition to abolitionism existed early on in Massachusetts, resulting in anti-abolitionist riots between 1835 and 1837,{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=185}} abolitionist views there gradually increased throughout the next few decades.{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=183}}{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|pp=187–93}} Abolitionists [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and [[Sojourner Truth]] lived in Springfield and Northampton, respectively, while [[Frederick Douglass]] lived in Boston and [[Susan B.

Although the [[Wall Street|U.S. stock market]] had sustained steep losses the last week in October 1929, [[October 29, 1929|Tuesday, October 29]] is remembered as the beginning of the Great Depression.

With the departure of several manufacturing companies, the state's industrial economy began to decline during the early 20th century. By the 1920s, competition from the [[American South]] and [[Midwest]], followed by the [[Great Depression]], led to the collapse of the three main industries in Massachusetts: textiles, shoemaking, and precision mechanics.{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=246}} This decline would continue into the latter half of the 20th century. Between 1950 and 1979, the number of Massachusetts residents involved in textile manufacturing declined from 264,000 to 63,000.{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=276}} The 1969 closure of the [[Springfield Armory]], in particular, spurred an exodus of high-paying jobs from Western Massachusetts, which suffered greatly as it de-industrialized during the century's last 40 years.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[University of Massachusetts Lowell]] |url=http://www.uml.edu/com/cita/05paperforrantmuckensturm.pdf |title=Job Loss, Shrinking Revenues, and Grinding Decline in Springfield, Massachusetts: Is A Finance Control Board the Answer? |access-date=June 10, 2015 |archive-date=October 18, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018103402/http://www.uml.edu/com/cita/05paperforrantmuckensturm.pdf }}</ref>

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of Massachusetts}}Most of Massachusetts has a [[humid continental climate]], with cold winters and warm summers. Far southeast coastal areas are the broad transition zone to [[Humid Subtropical]] climates. The warm to hot summers render the [[oceanic climate]] rare in this transition, only applying to exposed coastal areas such as on the peninsula of [[Barnstable County, Massachusetts|Barnstable County]]. The climate of [[Boston]] is quite representative for the commonwealth, characterized by summer highs of around {{convert|81|F|C}} and winter highs of {{convert|35|F|C}}, and is quite wet. Frosts are frequent all winter, even in coastal areas due to prevailing inland winds. Boston has a relatively sunny climate for a coastal city at its latitude, averaging over 2,600 hours of sunshine a year.

Global Change Research Program, the Northeast is "projected to be more than 3.6°F (2°C) warmer on average than during the preindustrial era".<ref name="natlclimate"/>{{Update after|2035}} As of August 2016, the EPA reports that Massachusetts has warmed by over two degrees Fahrenheit, or 1.1 degrees Celsius.<ref name="EPA Climate Change for Massachusetts">{{cite report|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/climate-change-ma.pdf|title=What Climate Change Means for Massachusetts|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|date=August 2016|format=PDF file|access-date=December 16, 2020}}</ref>

Shifting temperatures also result in the shifting of rainfall patterns and the intensification of precipitation events. To that end, average precipitation in the Northeast United States has risen by ten percent from 1895 to 2011, and the number of heavy precipitation events has increased by seventy percent during that time.<ref name="EPA Climate Change for Massachusetts" /> These increased precipitation patterns are focused in the winter and spring. Increasing temperatures coupled with increasing precipitation will result in earlier snow melts and subsequent drier soil in the summer months.<ref>{{cite web |title=Climate Change Made Summer Hotter and Drier Worldwide, Study Finds |url=https://www.carilec.org/climate-change-made-summer-hotter-and-drier-worldwide-study-finds/ |website=CARILEC |date=October 5, 2022 |access-date=December 4, 2022}}</ref>

The shifting climate in Massachusetts will result in a significant change to the state's built environment and ecosystems. In [[Boston]] alone, costs of climate change-related storms will result in $5 to $100 billion in damage.<ref name="EPA Climate Change for Massachusetts" />

Warmer temperatures will also disrupt bird migration and flora blooming. With these changes, deer populations are expected to increase, resulting in a decrease in underbrush which smaller fauna use as camouflage. Additionally, rising temperatures will increase the number of reported [[Lyme disease]] cases in the state. [[Tick]]s can transmit the disease once temperatures reach 45 degrees, so shorter winters will increase the window of transmission. These warmer temperatures will also increase the prevalence of [[Asian tiger mosquitoes]], which often carry the [[West Nile virus]].<ref name="EPA Climate Change for Massachusetts" />

To fight this change, the [[Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs]] has outlined a path to [[low-carbon economy|decarbonize]] the state's economy. On April 22, 2020, Kathleen A. Theoharides, the state's Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs, released a Determination of Statewide Emissions limits for 2050. In her letter, Theoharides stresses that as of 2020, the Commonwealth has experienced property damage attributable to climate change of more than $60 billion. To ensure that the Commonwealth experiences warming no more than 1.5&nbsp;°C of pre-industrialization levels, the state will work towards two goals by 2050: to achieve [[net-zero emissions]], and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 85 percent overall.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Theoharides |first1=Kathleen |last2=Polito |first2=Karyn |last3=Baker |first3=Charles |title=Determination of Statewide Emissions Limit for 2050 |url=https://www.mass.gov/doc/final-signed-letter-of-determination-for-2050-emissions-limit/download |website=Official websites of Massachusetts |access-date=May 20, 2022}}</ref>

===Power Initiatives===
{{main|Solar power in Massachusetts|Wind power in Massachusetts}}
{{see also|Plug-in electric vehicles in Massachusetts}}
The State of Massachusetts has developed a plethora of incentives to encourage the implementation of [[renewable energy]] and efficient appliances and home facilities. The Mass Save program, formed in conjunction with the State by several companies that provide power and gas in Massachusetts, provides homeowners and renters with monetary incentives to [[retrofit]] their homes with efficient HVAC equipment and other household appliances. Appliances such as water heaters, air conditioners, washers and driers, and heat pumps are eligible for rebates in order to incentivize change.<ref>{{cite web |title=Massachusetts Energy-Saving Rebates |url=https://www.masssave.com/rebates |website=MASS SAVE |access-date=May 20, 2022}}</ref>

The concept of Mass Save was created in 2008 by the passing of the Green Communities Act of 2008, during [[Deval Patrick]]'s tenure as [[governor]]. The main goal of the Green Communities Act was to reduce the consumption of [[fossil fuels]] in the State and to encourage new, more efficient technologies. Among others, one result of this act was a requirement for Program Administrators of utilities to invest in saving energy, as opposed to purchasing and generating additional energy where economically feasible. In Massachusetts, eleven Program Administrators, including [[Eversource]], [[National Grid (US)|National Grid]], [[Western Massachusetts Electric Company|Western Massachusetts Electric]], [[Cape Light Compact]], [[Until (company)|Until]], and [[Berkshire Gas]], jointly own the rights to this program, in conjunction with the [[Department of Energy Resources (Massachusetts)|MA Department of Energy Resources]] (DOER) and the [[Energy Efficiency Advisory Council]] (EEAC).<ref>{{cite web |title=MassSave: A New Model for Statewide Energy Efficiency Programs |url=https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2012/data/papers/0193-000169.pdf |access-date=May 21, 2022}}</ref>

The [[Massachusetts State Revenue Service|State Revenue Service]] provides incentives for the installation of [[solar panel]]s. In addition to the Federal Residential [[Renewable energy credit]], Massachusetts residents may be eligible for a tax credit of up to 15 percent of the project.<ref>{{cite web |title=830 CMR 62.6.1: Residential Energy Credit |url=https://www.mass.gov/regulations/830-CMR-6261-residential-energy-credit |website=Mass.gov |access-date=May 21, 2022}}</ref> Once installed, arrays are eligible for [[net metering]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Net Metering Guide |url=https://www.mass.gov/guides/net-metering-guide |website=Mass.gov |access-date=May 21, 2022}}</ref> Certain municipalities will offer up to $1.20 per watt, up to 50 percent of the system's cost on PV arrays 25&nbsp;kW or less.<ref>{{cite web |title=Municipal Light Plant Solar Rebate Program |url=https://www.mass.gov/guides/municipal-light-plant-solar-rebate-program |website=Mass.gov |access-date=May 21, 2022 |archive-date=June 11, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220611213114/https://www.mass.gov/guides/municipal-light-plant-solar-rebate-program }}</ref> The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources also offered low-interest, fixed-rate financing with loan support for low-income residents until December 31, 2020.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mass Solar Loan |url=https://www.masssolarloan.com/ |website=Mass Solar Loan |access-date=May 21, 2022}}</ref>

As a part of the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources' effort to incentivize the usage of [[renewable energy]], the Massachusetts Offers Rebates for Electric Vehicles (MOR-EV) initiative was created. With this incentive, residents may qualify for a state-provided incentive of up to $2,500 for the purchase or lease of an [[electric vehicle]], or $1,500 for the purchase or lease of a [[plug-in hybrid]] vehicle.<ref>{{cite web |title=MOR-EV IS A Massachusetts Program That Issues Rebates to Electric Vehicle Drivers |url=https://mor-ev.org/ |website=MOR-EV |access-date=May 26, 2022}}</ref> This rebate is available in addition to the tax credits offered by the [[United States Department of Energy]] for the purchase of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.<ref>{{cite web |title=State and Federal Electric Vehicle Funding Programs |url=https://www.mass.gov/service-details/state-and-federal-electric-vehicle-funding-programs |website=MASS.GOV |access-date=May 26, 2022}}</ref>

For income-eligible residents, Mass Save has partnered with Massachusetts Community Action Program Agencies and [[Low-Income Energy Affordability Network]] (LEAN) to offer residents assistance with upgrades to their homes that will result in more efficient energy usage. Residents may qualify for a replacement of their heating system, insulation installation, appliances, and thermostats if they meet the income qualifications provided on Mass Save's website. For residents of 5+ family residential buildings, there are additional income-restricted benefits available through LEAN. If at least 50 percent of the residents of the building qualify as low income, [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] improvements like those available through Mass Save are available. Residential structures operated by non-profit organizations, for profit operations, or housing authorities may take advantage of these programs.<ref>"''Income Eligible Programs.''" Mass Save, www.masssave.com/saving/income-based-offers/income-eligible-programs.</ref>

In late 2020, the administration of Massachusetts governor [[Charlie Baker]] released a decarbonization roadmap to aim for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The plan calls for major investments in [[offshore wind]] and solar energy. It would also require all new cars sold in the state to be zero-emissions ([[Electric cars|electric]] or [[Hydrogen powered car|hydrogen powered]]) by 2035.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/12/30/science/mass-require-all-new-cars-sold-be-electric-by-2035-part-climate-change-measures/|title=Mass. to require all new cars sold to be electric by 2035 as part of climate-change measures|first=Naomi |last=Martin|work=The Boston Globe|date= December 30, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mass.gov/doc/ma-2050-decarbonization-roadmap|title=MA2050DecarbonizationRoadmap_FINAL.pdf &#124; Mass.gov|website=mass.gov}}</ref>

As of the 2014 Pew study, Christians made up 57% of the state's population, with [[Protestantism|Protestants]] making up 21% of them. [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] made up 34% and now predominate because of massive immigration from primarily Catholic countries and regions—chiefly Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Quebec, and Latin America. Both Protestant and Roman Catholic communities have been in decline since the late 20th century, due to the rise of [[irreligion]] in [[New England]]. It is the most irreligious region of the country, along with the [[Western United States]]; for comparison and contrast however, in 2020, the Public Religion Research Institute determined 67% of the population were Christian reflecting a slight increase of religiosity.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=PRRI – American Values Atlas |url=https://ava.prri.org/#religious/2020/States/religion/m/US-MA |access-date=September 17, 2022 |website=ava.prri.org}}</ref> A significant Jewish population immigrated to the Boston and Springfield areas between 1880 and 1920.

A great majority of interstates in Massachusetts were constructed during the mid-20th century, and at times were controversial, particularly the intent [[Southwest Corridor (Massachusetts)|to route I-95 northeastwards from Providence, Rhode Island, directly through central Boston]], first proposed in 1948. Opposition to continued construction grew, and in 1970 Governor [[Francis W. Sargent]] issued a general prohibition on most further freeway construction within the I-95/Route 128 loop in the Boston area.{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|pp=283–284}} A massive undertaking to bring I-93 underground in downtown Boston, called the [[Big Dig]], brought the city's highway system under public scrutiny for its high cost and construction quality.<ref name=BigDig1/>

Massachusetts has a long political history; earlier political structures included the [[Mayflower Compact]] of 1620, the separate [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Massachusetts Bay]] and [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]] colonies, and the combined colonial [[Province of Massachusetts]]. The [[Massachusetts Constitution]] was ratified in 1780 while the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] was in progress, four years after the [[Articles of Confederation]] was drafted, and eight years before the present [[United States Constitution]] was ratified on June 21, 1788. Drafted by [[John Adams]], the Massachusetts Constitution is the oldest functioning written constitution in continuous effect in the world.<ref>{{cite book |last=Levy |first=Leonard |title=Seasoned Judgments: The American Constitution, Rights, and History |year=1995 |page=307 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-7lKq0dfs54C&pg=PA307 |access-date=June 10, 2015|isbn=978-1-4128-3382-0 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Kemp |first=Roger |title=Documents of American Democracy |year=2010 |page=59 |publisher=McFarland |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JHawgM-WnlUC&pg=PA59|isbn=978-0-7864-5674-1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Murrin |first=John |title=Liberty, Power, and Equality: A History |year=2011 |publisher=Cengage Learning |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CADtJymgzk4C&pg=PT222|isbn=978-0-495-91587-4 }}</ref> It has been amended 121 times, most recently in 2022.<ref>{{cite web |title=Massachusetts Constitution |url=https://malegislature.gov/Laws/Constitution |website=malegislature.gov |access-date=December 4, 2022}}</ref>

[[File:Maura Healey, official portrait, governor.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Maura Healey]] ([[Democratic Party (Massachusetts)|D]]), the 73rd [[Governor of Massachusetts]]]]
The [[Massachusetts government|Government of Massachusetts]] is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The [[governor of Massachusetts]] heads the executive branch, while legislative authority vests in a separate but coequal legislature. Meanwhile, judicial power is constitutionally guaranteed to the independent judicial branch.<ref>{{cite web |title=Massachusetts Government Structure |url=https://budget.digital.mass.gov/bb/h1/fy10h1/prnt10/exec10/pbuddevstructure.htm |website=budget.digital.mass.gov |access-date=December 3, 2022}}</ref>

====Executive branch====
As chief executive, the governor is responsible for signing or vetoing legislation, filling judicial and agency appointments, granting pardons, preparing an annual budget, and commanding the [[Massachusetts National Guard]].<ref name=MassPol1>{{cite web |url=http://www.sec.state.ma.us/cis/cismaf/mf1b.htm |title=Massachusetts Facts: Politics |publisher=[[Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth]] |access-date=June 1, 2010}}</ref> Massachusetts governors, unlike those of most other states, are addressed as His/Her Excellency.<ref name=MassPol1/> The governor is [[Maura Healey]] and the incumbent lieutenant governor is [[Kim Driscoll]]. The governor conducts the affairs of state alongside a separate [[Massachusetts Governor's Council|Governor's Council]] made up of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts|lieutenant governor]] and eight separately elected councilors.<ref name=MassPol1/> The council is charged by the state constitution with reviewing and confirming gubernatorial appointments and pardons, approving disbursements out of the state treasury, and certifying elections, among other duties.<ref name=MassPol1 />

Aside from the governor and Governor's Council, the executive branch also includes four independently elected constitutional officers: a [[Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth|secretary of the commonwealth]], an [[Massachusetts Attorney General|attorney general]], a [[Treasurer and Receiver-General of Massachusetts|state treasurer]], and a [[Massachusetts State Auditor|state auditor]]. The commonwealth's incumbent constitutional officers are respectively [[William F. Galvin]], [[Andrea Campbell]], [[Deb Goldberg]] and [[Diana DiZoglio]], all [[Massachusetts Democratic Party|Democrats]]. In accordance with state statute, the secretary of the commonwealth administers elections, regulates lobbyists and the securities industry, registers corporations, serves as register of deeds for the entire state, and preserves public records as keeper of the [[Seal of Massachusetts|state seal]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.state.ma.us/|title=Main Menu|publisher=Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth|access-date=May 14, 2022}}</ref> Meanwhile, the attorney general provides legal services to state agencies, combats fraud and corruption, investigates and prosecutes crimes, and enforces consumer protection, environment, labor, and civil rights laws as Massachusetts chief lawyer and law enforcement officer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mass.gov/orgs/office-of-attorney-general-maura-healey|title=Office of the Attorney General|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|access-date=May 14, 2022}}</ref> At the same time, the state treasurer manages the state's cash flow, debt, and investments as chief financial officer, whereas the state auditor conducts audits, investigations, and studies as chief audit executive in order to promote government accountability and transparency and improve state agency financial management, legal compliance, and performance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.masstreasury.org/departments|title=Departments|publisher=Office of the Treasurer and Receiver-General|access-date=May 14, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mass.gov/orgs/office-of-the-state-auditor|title=Office of the State Auditor|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|access-date=May 14, 2022}}</ref>

The [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] and [[Massachusetts Senate]] comprise the legislature of Massachusetts, known as the [[Massachusetts General Court]].<ref name=MassPol1/> The House consists of 160 members while the Senate has 40 members.<ref name=MassPol1 /> Leaders of the House and Senate are chosen by the members of those bodies; the leader of the House is known as the Speaker while the leader of the Senate is known as the President.<ref name=MassPol1/> Each branch consists of several committees.<ref name=MassPol1/> Members of both bodies are elected to two-year terms.<ref>{{cite web |title=Number of Legislators and Length of Terms in Years |url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/number-of-legislators-and-length-of-terms.aspx |publisher=[[National Conference of State Legislatures]] |access-date=May 4, 2015}}</ref>

====Judicial branch====
The [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] (a chief justice and six associates) are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Governor's Council, as are all other judges in the state.<ref name=MassPol1 />

Federal court cases are heard in the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts]], and appeals are heard by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]].<ref>{{cite web |location=US |url=http://www.uscourts.gov/file/document/us-federal-courts-circuit-map |title=Geographic Boundaries of United States Courts of Appeals and United States District Courts |publisher=United States Courts |format=PDF |access-date=May 12, 2015}}</ref>

For more than 70 years, Massachusetts has shifted from a previously [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-leaning state to one [[red states and blue states|largely dominated]] by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]; the [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1952|1952 victory]] of [[John F. Kennedy]] over incumbent Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]] is seen as a watershed moment in this transformation. His younger brother [[Ted Kennedy|Edward M. Kennedy]] held that seat until his death from a brain tumor in 2009.{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=310}} Since the 1950s, Massachusetts has gained a reputation as being a politically liberal state and is often used as an archetype of [[modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]], hence the phrase "[[Massachusetts liberal]]".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-07-25-mass-liberal_x.htm |title=Does 'Massachusetts liberal' label still matter? |first1=Susan |last1=Page |first2=Jill |last2=Lawrence |work=[[USA Today]] |date=July 11, 2004 |access-date=October 17, 2009}}</ref>

Massachusetts is one of the most Democratic states in the country. Democratic core concentrations are everywhere, except for a handful of Republican leaning towns in the Central and Southern parts of the state. Until recently, Republicans were dominant in the Western and Northern suburbs of Boston, however both areas heavily swung Democratic in the Trump era. The state as a whole has not given its [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] votes to a Republican in a [[United States presidential election|presidential election]] since [[Ronald Reagan]] carried it in [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]], and not a single county has voted for a Republican presidential candidate since [[1988 United States presidential election in Massachusetts|1988]] . Additionally, Massachusetts provided Reagan with his smallest margins of victory in both the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]]<ref>{{cite web |title=1980 Presidential General Election Results—Massachusetts |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?f=0&fips=25&year=1980 |publisher=[[Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections]] |access-date=May 5, 2015}}</ref> and 1984 elections.<ref>{{cite web |title=1984 Presidential General Election Results—Massachusetts |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?f=0&fips=25&year=1984 |publisher=[[Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections]] |access-date=May 5, 2015}}</ref> Massachusetts had been the only state to vote for Democrat [[George McGovern]] in the [[1972 United States Presidential Election|1972 presidential election]].

Democrats have an absolute grip on the Massachusetts congressional delegation; there are no Republicans elected to serve at the federal level. Both Senators and all nine Representatives are Democrats; only one Republican (former Senator [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]]) has been elected to either house of Congress from Massachusetts since 1994. Massachusetts is the most populous state to be represented in the [[United States Congress]] entirely by a single party.<ref>{{cite web |last1=master |first1=Por |title=Capital of massachusetts – |url=https://sinproeste.org.br/capital-of-massachusetts/ |website=Sinproeste |date=October 12, 2022 |access-date=December 4, 2022 |language=pt-BR}}</ref>

As of the 2018 elections, the Democratic Party holds a super-majority over the Republican Party in [[Bicameralism|both chambers]] of the [[Massachusetts General Court]] (state legislature). Out of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives|state house]]'s 160 seats, Democrats hold 127 seats (79%) compared to the Republican Party's 32 seats (20%), an [[Susannah Whipps|independent sits in the remaining one]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Members of the House of Representatives |url=https://malegislature.gov/People/House |publisher=[[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] |access-date=January 18, 2019}}</ref> and 37 out of the 40 seats in the [[Massachusetts state senate|state senate]] (92.5%) belong to the Democratic Party compared to the Republican Party's three seats (7.5%).<ref>{{cite web |title=Members of the Senate |url=https://malegislature.gov/People/Senate |publisher=[[Massachusetts Senate]] |access-date=January 18, 2019}}</ref> Both houses of the legislature have had Democratic majorities since the 1950s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hudak |first1=John |title=Presidential pork: White House influence over the distribution of federal grants |date=2014 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |isbn=978-0-8157-2520-6 |page=202 |url=https://www.brookings.edu/book/presidential-pork/ |access-date=December 4, 2022}}</ref>

Massachusetts has contributed to American arts and culture. Drawing from its [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[Yankee]] roots, along with later immigrant groups, Massachusetts has produced several writers, artists, and musicians. Some major museums and important historical sites are also located there, and events and festivals throughout the year celebrate the state's history and heritage.<ref>{{cite web |title=History Museums |date=June 3, 2013 |url=http://www.massvacation.com/explore/history/history-museums/ |publisher=Massachusetts Office of Travel and Tourism |access-date=May 6, 2015}}</ref>

Massachusetts was an early center of the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] movement, which emphasized intuition, emotion, human individuality and a deeper connection with nature.{{sfn|Goldfield|Abbott|Anderson|Argersinger|1998|p=254}} [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], who was born in Boston but spent much of his later life in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]], largely created the philosophy with his 1836 work [[Nature (essay)|''Nature'']], and continued to be a key figure in the movement for the remainder of his life. Emerson's friend, [[Henry David Thoreau]], who was also involved in Transcendentalism, recorded his year spent alone in a small cabin at nearby [[Walden Pond]] in the 1854 work ''[[Walden; or, Life in the Woods]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Walden Pond State Reservation |url=http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/dcr/massparks/region-north/walden-pond-state-reservation.html |publisher=[[Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs]] |access-date=May 6, 2015}}</ref>
