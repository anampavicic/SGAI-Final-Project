As of December 2021, the population of the city is 106,928.<ref name="population" />

Founded in the 9th century, Włocławek is located in the historical region of [[Kuyavia]], and was its administrative center and main city in the [[Middle Ages]]. Nowadays, Włocławek is the third largest city of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship (after [[Bydgoszcz]] and [[Toruń]]) and the main cultural and economic center of eastern Kuyavia. It is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Włocławek]], one of the oldest dioceses in Poland, since the 12th century, with the landmark [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Włocławek Cathedral]] listed as a [[List of Historic Monuments (Poland)|Historic Monument of Poland]].<ref name=ph/> Poland's largest [[Hydroelectric power plant in Włocławek|hydroelectric power plant]] is also located there.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Włocławek}}
Włocławek's history dates back to the late [[Iron Age|Bronze Age]] – early Iron Age (1300 BCE – 500 BCE). Archaeological excavations conducted on the current city site uncovered the remains of a [[Human settlement|settlement]] belonging to the [[Lusatian culture]], as well as evidence of a settlement of early [[Pomeranian culture]] which had been established. Traces of additional settlements dating to the [[Roman period]] and the early [[Middle Ages]] have also been excavated in the area.<ref name="lo2.wloclawek.q4.pl">{{cite web|url=http://www.lo2.wloclawek.q4.pl/Comenius/kulturawl.pdf|title=About Włocławek|website=Lo2.wloclawek.q4.pl|access-date=22 May 2018}}</ref>

One of the earliest references to the town came from an assistant to the [[Archbishop of Gniezno]] who was noted as residing in the town in 1123. Later the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Włocławek|Diocese of Włocławek]] ({{langx|la|Vladislaviensis}}) of [[Kuyavia]] in 1148, notates its existence in a [[papal bull|bull]] issued by [[Pope Eugene III]], while mentioning the first bishop of Włocławek as Warner. Warner was followed by an [[Italian people|Italian]], Onoldius; the diocese was recorded as "Włocławek and [[Pomerania]]" (''Vladislaviensis et Pomeraniae'').

In the 12th century, there was a mint and a customs chamber, where tolls were collected from ships and boats sailing on the Vistula and [[Zgłowiączka (river)|Zgłowiączka]] rivers.<ref name=atlas10/> A hospital was founded at the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries,<ref name=atlas10/> whereas the local school was first mentioned in 1215.<ref>{{cite book|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=Atlas historyczny miast polskich.

Włocławek received its [[town privileges|city rights]] in 1255. During the 14th and 15th centuries, the city was destroyed and captured several times by the [[Teutonic Knights]] and renamed it Leslau.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)|Treaty of Thorn]], signed in 1411, resulted in short-lived peace for the city, however, it prospered from its involvement in the ransoming of the captured Teutonic Knights which was payable in three instalments and proved to be a hardship on the Prussian faction. Włocławek was located within the [[Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship]] of the [[Greater Poland Province, Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Greater Poland Province]]. There is a possibility that [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], the later renowned astronomer, may have attended the local cathedral school in the late 15th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://szlakkopernikowski.pl/pl/wloclawek|title=Włocławek|website=Szlak Kopernikowski|access-date=11 December 2023|language=pl}}</ref>

===Modern era===
[[File:Włocławek-Kopernik Square on photograph by Sztejner.jpg|thumb|left|Włocławek in 1896]]
The city's prosperity came from river transport of grain from Kuyavia, the collection of tolls on grain floated from the more southern part of Poland to the country's main port of [[Gdańsk]], transport of timber from the [[Narew]], [[Bug (river)|Bug]] and upper Vistula rivers for export to Western Europe and [[brewing]].<ref name=pipw19>{{cite book|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=Przewodnik ilustrowany po Włocławku|year=1922|language=pl|location=Włocławek|publisher=Księgarnia Powszechna i Drukarnia Diecezjalna we Włocławku|pages=19–20}}</ref> This is mentioned in the 1595 poem ''Flis, to jest Spuszczanie statków Wisłą i inszymi rzekami do niej przypadającymi'' by [[Sebastian Klonowic]].<ref name=pipw19/>

During [[World War II]], Włocławek was occupied by German troops, which entered the city on 14 September 1939. Under the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|Nazi German occupation]] Włocławek was again renamed Leslau, annexed by decree to the German Reich on 8 October 1939 and administered from 26 October as a part of Reichsgau Posen (renamed on 29 January 1940 [[Reichsgau Wartheland]]).

Already in September 1939, Germans committed a massacre of a group of local Jews<ref>{{cite book|last=Wardzyńska|first=Maria|year=2009|title=Był rok 1939.

Włocławek was liberated on 20 January 1945 by [[Red Army|Soviet]] troops of the [[1st Belorussian Front]] during the [[Vistula–Oder Offensive]]. One third of the city was destroyed, but its factories and workshops were rebuilt by the [[People's Republic of Poland|Polish government]] in the following decades.

===Recent period===
The most important industries in Włocławek today are [[chemical industry]], production of [[furniture]], and [[food processing]]. The [[dam]] which was constructed in 1969 regulates the water level of the [[Vistula river]], forming [[Włocławek Reservoir]]. From 1975 to 1999, the city was the capital of the [[Włocławek Voivodeship]].

The Catholic [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] Fr. (now [[Beatification|Blessed]]), [[Jerzy Popiełuszko]], who was associated with the workers' and trade union movement [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], and who was also a member of the opposition to the Communist regime in Poland, was tortured and murdered by three [[Security Police]] officers, and was thrown into the Włocławek Reservoir, close to the city. His body was recovered from the reservoir on 30 October 1984.

From 2012 the city is part of the Special Economic Zone - Włocławek Economic Development Area – Industrial and Technological Park with tax-free areas and incentives for investors.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wloclawek.pl/strefa |title=W這c豉wska Strefa Rozwoju Gospodarczego - Park Przemys這wo-Technologiczny |access-date=17 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529204010/http://www.wloclawek.pl/strefa/ |archive-date=29 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===The Jewish Community in Włocławek===
[[File:Wloclawek Ghetto memorial.jpg|thumb|Memorial at the site of the former World War II ghetto]]
The Jewish population increased from 218 (6.6%) in 1820 to 6,919 in 1910 (20.5%) and 13,500 in 1939. One of the founders of the [[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizracḥi]] movement, rabbi Leib Kowalski (1895–1925), lived and worked in Włocławek. During the interbellum period, the town had several Jewish schools (primary and high schools), two yeshivas, and three Jewish sports clubs.<ref name="yivo">[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/W%C5%82oc%C5%82awek Włocławek]. "The YIVO Encyclopedia. Jews in Eastern Europe". Retrieved 12 March 2015</ref>

With the beginning of the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)|German occupation of Poland]], Włocławek became the first town in Europe in which Jews were required to wear distinctive [[yellow badge]]s.<ref>"[https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10008211 Jewish Badge: During the Nazi Era]". [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]. ushmm.org. Retrieved 3 May 2017.</ref> Murders of Jews began in 1939 and the Włocławek [[Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland|ghetto]] was created in November 1940. The Nazis deported 3,000 of Włocławek's Jews to ghettos and labor camps between December 1939 and June 1941. Some 2,000 Jews were deported to [[Łódź]] and then to the [[Chełmno extermination camp]] between 26 and 30 September 1941. The ghetto was burnt in late April 1942 after the remaining Jews were sent to Chelmno where they were immediately gassed.<ref name="yivo"/> Most of the Jews sent to the [[Łódź Ghetto]] died of starvation or illness, and many were sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] from Łódź.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Megargee |first1=Geoffrey |title=Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos |date=2012 |publisher=University of Indiana Press |location=Bloomington, Indiana |isbn=978-0-253-35599-7 |page=Volume II 118–119}}</ref>

After the war nearly 1000 Jews returned to Włocławek and re-established their community. However, Jews left after disputes within the community itself, and the desire of most Jews not to live under Communism, installed by the Soviets.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wloclawek |url=https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/W%C5%82oc%C5%82awek |website=YIVO Encyclopedia of Eastern European Jews |publisher=YIVO}}</ref> By the late 1960s, the community had disappeared.

Today there is only very little, if any trace at all, of their once rich and lively community. There is a table for victims of Jewish ghetto in Włocławek's Rakutówek neighborhood (Polish Tablica Ofiar Getta we Włocławku) and Jewish Cemetery at Municipal/Communal Cemetery (Polish Cmentarz Komunalny we Włocławku).
