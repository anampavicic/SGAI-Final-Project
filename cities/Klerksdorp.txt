'''Klerksdorp''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ɑːr|k|s|d|ɔːr|p}} {{respell|KLARKS|dorp}}) is located in the [[North West Province (South Africa)|North West Province]], South Africa. Klerksdorp is located {{cvt|165|km}} southeast of [[Mahikeng]], the provincial capital.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.matlosana.gov.za/Documents/IDP/IDP%20REVIEW%20DOCUMENT%20%202017-2018%20DRAFT1.pdf |title=2017-2022 Integrated Development Plan REVIEW of the City of Matlosana |access-date=2017-09-08 |archive-date=2017-09-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908201011/http://www.matlosana.gov.za/Documents/IDP/IDP%20REVIEW%20DOCUMENT%20%202017-2018%20DRAFT1.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> Klerksdorp was also the first capital of the then [[Transvaal Republic]] and used to be the home of the first Stock Exchange in the region. It became an important trading town linking [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] to [[Johannesburg]]. It became home to a mix of farmers, miners and immigrants servicing the two industries.It was then located there because of availability of water and climate change

==History==
===Beginnings (1837/38 and on)===
The city was founded in 1837 or 1838<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Klerksdorp|volume=15|page=846}}</ref> when the [[Voortrekkers]] settled on the banks of the ''Schoonspruit''&thinsp;<ref name=EB1911/> ("Clear stream"), which flows through the town. Klerksdorp is the oldest European settlement north of the [[Vaal River]], and thus of the former Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (Z.A.R), also known as the [[Transvaal Republic]].

The most prominent of the first settlers was Hendrik Grobler<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Klerksdorp Groeiende Reus|last=Marx|first=Roelf|publisher=Klerksdorp City Council|year=1987|editor-last=Marx|editor-first=Roelf|edition=1st|location=Klerksdorp|pages=11–12|language=af|trans-title=Klerksdorp Growing Giant}}</ref> who claimed a farm of about {{cvt|160|km2}}, called it ''Elandsheuwel'' ("Hill of the [[Common Eland|Eland]]"). He gave plots of land and communal grazing rights on this farm to other Voortrekkers in return for their labour in building a dam and an irrigation canal. This collection of [[smallholding]]s was later given the name of Klerksdorp in honour of the first ''landdrost'' ([[magistrate]]) of the area, Jacob de Clercq.

===City status===
Although Klerksdorp was officially proclaimed a town only in 1888, long before that it was considered a town not only by its residents, but also by visitors and even by authorities.

In 1850 the Rev. A. Murray mentioned the "town on the Schoonspruit" during his trip through the Transvaal. In the same year, an official document, an inspection report, spoke of the "town of Klerksdorp" when the residents requested additional pieces of land.

Seven years later, in 1857, state attorney J. H. Visagie wrote to government secretary C. Moll that it was desirable that regulations be drawn up for Klerksdorp. President M. W. Pretorius then issued regulations for Klerksdorp and Skoonspruit in 1859.

In a letter to the President, magistrate [[Cornelis Johannes Bodenstein]] of [[Potchefstroom]] in 1863 also designated Klerksdorp as a town.

The Executive Council had a sketch map of the town drawn up in 1871 and according to article 196 of the minutes dated 18 January 1872 the town regulations were approved.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book |title=Klerksdorp: Groeiende Reus |language=af}}</ref>

===Gold rush of 1885===
In November 1885<ref name=":0" /> [[gold]] was discovered in the Klerksdorp district by M. G. Jansen van Vuuren<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|title=Letter by M. G. Janse van Vuuren to Z.A.R. Government|last=Janse van Vuuren|first=M.G.|date=November 1885|via=Transvaal Archives Depot R5804/85}}</ref> as well as on the [[Witwatersrand]], which lies about {{cvt|160|km}} to the east. As a consequence, thousands of fortune-seekers descended on the small village, turning it into a town with 70 [[tavern]]s and even a [[stock exchange]] of its own. This stock exchange opened its doors in 1888 and soon did a roaring trade, selling as much as the equivalent of R20,000 in one day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Klerksdorp's Fifty Years of Mining|last=Guest|first=H.|publisher=Klerksdorp Record|year=1938|location=Klerksdorp|pages=21}}</ref>
[[File:Klerksdorp_Stock_Exchange.jpg|thumb|Old Klerksdorp Stock Exchange]]

However, the nature of the gold reef demanded expensive and sophisticated equipment to mine and extract the gold, causing the majority of diggers to move away in the late 1890s and leading to a decline in the gold mining industry. This also led to an early demise for the Stock Exchange that stood empty for many years, were converted to a cinema in 1912 and finally being demolished in 1958.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Golden Heritage|last=Brown|first=A.|publisher=Andrew Brown|year=1983|location=Stilfontein|pages=93}}</ref> The amalgamation process<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.miningfacts.org/environment/does-mining-use-mercury/|title=Does mining use mercury?|date=2012|website=Miningfacts.org|access-date=2018-03-12|archive-date=2018-03-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312171018/http://www.miningfacts.org/environment/does-mining-use-mercury/|url-status=dead}}</ref> used to extract the gold from the crushed ore was relatively inefficient and largely contributed to decline.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Klerksdorp, Hub of the Golden West|year=1957|location=Klerksdorp|pages=47}}</ref> By 1893 the new [[Gold cyanidation|MacArthur–Forrest process]] used for gold extraction brought a short-lived revival in the Klerksdorp gold mining industry, but uncertainty created by the [[Jameson Raid]] of December 1895 as well as transport problems created by the [[rinderpest]]<ref>{{Cite web |last= |date=2017-06-27 |title=Rinderpest |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/rinderpest |access-date=2018-03-12 |website=Encyclopaedia Britannica}}</ref> of 1896 soon led to a near collapse of the industry.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Klerksdorp Groeiende Reus|last=Marx|first=Roelf|publisher=Klerksdorp City Council|year=1987|location=Klerksdorp|pages=29}}</ref>

===Second Boer War (1899–1902)===
During the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902), heavy fighting occurred in the area, which also housed two large [[concentration camp]]s, one for Whites (centred on modern day Klerksdorp High School) and a separate one for Africans (situated in the area that is today the Ellaton and Neserhof suburbs).
[[File:Klerksdorp Campc.1901 (22701922869).jpg|thumb|Klerksdorp Concentration Camp for Africans]]
[[File:Klerksdorp Concentration Camp for Whites.jpg|thumb|Klerksdorp Concentration Camp for Whites<ref>{{Cite news|title=Klerksdorp Concentration Camp for Whites|last=Klerksdorp Museum Collection}}</ref>]]

The most famous of the battles around Klerksdorp, is that of the Battle of Ysterspruit ("Iron Stream"), in which the Boer general [[Koos de la Rey]] achieved a great victory. The battle is one of the most celebrated of the general's career, being the battle in which the Boer soldiers pioneered the art of firing from horseback. On April 11, 1902, Rooiwal, near Klerksdorp, saw the Battle of Rooiwal, the last major engagement of the war, where a Boer charge was beaten off by entrenched British troops.

The graves of the victims of both the concentration camps can still be visited today in the Old Cemetery Complex just outside town,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.kaundadistrict.gov.za/index.php/tourism/heritage-sites?download=121:matlosana-municipality|title=Matlosana Municipality Catalogue of Heritage Sites|access-date=2018-03-12|archive-date=2017-09-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925011817/http://www.kaundadistrict.gov.za/index.php/tourism/heritage-sites?download=121:matlosana-municipality|url-status=dead}}</ref> numbering just below a thousand.

===Desmond Tutu and Boer heritage===
Today Klerksdorp is celebrated as the birthplace of Anglican Archbishop Emeritus [[Desmond Mpilo Tutu]] on October 7, 1931. He received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1984 for his work towards "a democratic and just society without racial divisions". The life work of [[Desmond Tutu]] has been to heal the scars left among the descendants of the many battles for control of South Africa. There is an irony of his birthplace set amidst Boer monuments and old battlefields, early settlements by those same Boers, among them famous leaders like [[Jacob de Clerq]], even close to [[Witwatersrand]] where gold was discovered. He somehow managed to rise beyond pettiness and division to bring all these forces together with displaced native peoples in places such as this creating an international role model. He was later awarded multiple worldwide honours for his achievements in the reconciliation of the ethnic and cultural divisions in the history of his country.[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1984/tutu-bio.html]

===Economic revival since 1932===
The gold mining industry was revived by large mining companies in 1932 during the [[Free State Gold Rush]], causing the town to undergo an economic revival, which accelerated after [[World War II]].

===Newspaper===
The first local newspaper, "The Klerksdorp Pioneer" was published in 1887. In November 1888 it was replaced by George Vickers's newspaper "The Representative". This in turn was replaced by H.M Guest's "Klerksdorp Mining Record" in August 1899. It still exist as the "Klerksdorp Record".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tourism History |url=https://www.matlosana.gov.za/TourismHistory.html#:~:text=The%20first%20local%20newspaper%2C%20%22The,as%20the%20%22Klerksdorp%20Record%22. |website=City of Matlosana Local Municipality}}</ref>

==Economy==
===Economic History===
In 1865, twenty-eight years after Klerksdorp had been founded, James Taylor opened the doors of the dofF's first trading store. During 1871 he was joined in a partnership by Thomas Smith Leask, a retired elephant-hunter and trader. The store, known as "Taylor and Leask", was the only one at Klerksdorp and became the centre of the town's activities and the rendezvous of hunters and traders who brought ivory and skins from the "interior" (Matebeleland and Mashonaland) and refitted for their next expedition. Both Taylor and Leask were on friendly terms with the majority of the hunters and F .C. Selous, a prolific letter-writer, visited the town several times. In one of his letters he mentioned that it had cost him £1 600 to outfit at the Klerksdorp store. When Taylor died of fever in 1878, Thomas Leask bought out Mrs Taylor and re-established the firm on his own account, as "Thomas Leask and Co.<ref name=":4" />

===Mining===
The introduction in April 1890 of a new gold recovery process by Mr John S. McArthur and Dr Forrest (known as the McArthur Forrest Cyanide Process, and mentioned earlier) made it possible to recover most of the gold contents which had hitherto been lost. This process signalled a new era of prosperity and brought about a revival, since advantage was taken of the newly-discovered methods and cyanide plants were built on several local mines.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal |last=Orford |first=J.G |title=A street called Boom- Some glimpse of Pioneer |url=https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:bead107e-092f-3aa5-ba54-9cff40ba4447 |journal=}}</ref>

Though the depression in the town was bad, several mines continued in production, and, coupled with agriculture, the slump was survived. Subsequent periods of depression and slumps have since hit the Klerksdorp district, but they have been mild in comparison with the dreadful experiences of 1889 and 1890. During December 1892 Thomas Leask, Managing Director of the Nooitgedacht mine, brought a glimmer of hope to some 200 people whom he addressed at the mine. He told the crowd that one thousand ounces of gold had been extracted. His daughter Lulu started the engine of the newly-installed five-stamp battery. The conventional bottle of champagne was broken and refreshments were served.

After several mines had installed the new cyanide process, the gold output, which was merely about 7 000 ounces in 1890, increasesd to 10 967 in 1892 and 12 780 in 1893. By the end of 1895 there were 25 companies in existence and the gold output soared to a phenomenal 71 776 ounces -it now appeared as if the gold industry in Klerksdorp was firmly established and the depression of the late eighties was finally shaken off.

===Jouberton===
Klerksdorp's black residential area was laid out in 1907 south of the town where the residential areas of Neserhof and Ellaton are today. Already in 1924, there was talk of moving the blacks, but it was decided to let it stand until the financial problems associated with such a move were resolved.

In 1935 and 1936, the city council once again decided to move them, but this was not carried out either.

With a view to the southward expansion of the town, the then city council was finally obliged to undertake the relocation. In 1949, construction began on the first 32 houses in the new black residential area, Jouberton. Originally it would be the name [[Joubertina]], named after councilor Jan Joubert. Because there was already a town with this name in the [[Cape Province]] (now [[Eastern Cape]]), it was changed to Jouberton to avoid confusion.<ref name=":5" />

===Alabama===
The Colored people first lived in an area adjacent to the old industrial area, but in 1956 the surveying of Alabama, the new residential area, began. Two years later, in 1958, the layout of the residential area began.<ref name=":5" />

===Klerksdorp district===
The greater city area surrounding Klerksdorp incorporates the towns of [[Orkney, South Africa|Orkney]], [[Kanana, North West|Kanana]], [[Stilfontein]], Khuma, [[Hartbeesfontein]] and Tigane, giving it a population of more than 350,000 inhabitants. 

Due to their geographical location and interconnectedness, there has been talk of amalgamation between Klerksdorp, Stilfontein and Orkney since 1975 and in 1979 a commission of inquiry into the matter was established. However, both Stilfontein and Orkney's city council rejected the idea of amalgamation in 1980.<ref name=":0" />

==Modern Klerksdorp==

===Modern Economy===
All of the South African major banks like FNB, ABSA, Standard Bank, Nedbank and Capitec Bank have branches in the city.

Together with [[Rustenburg]], Klerksdorp forms the economic heart of North West Province. It is one of the hubs of the South African gold mining industry, although its importance has been decreasing in recent years. A major earthquake in March 2005 caused significant damage to the eastern suburb of Stilfontein and caused widespread damage to mining activities. It is expected to be a large [[uranium]] producer in the future.

Apart from mining, Klerksdorp is positioned as a notable medical, retail and educational centre for North West Province and Northern Free State.

The Klerksdorp district is a major contributor to South African [[agriculture]];   [[maize]], [[sorghum]], [[peanut|groundnuts]] and [[sunflower]] are important crops farmed in the district. Klerksdorp has the largest agricultural co-op in the [[southern hemisphere]], named '[https://www.senwes.co.za/ Senwes]'.

The farming district is also known for its [[Sussex cattle]] herds - the city is the headquarters of the South African Sussex Cattle Breeders Association.

Several national departments and agencies have branches offices in the city ([[South African Revenue Service|SARS]] and the [[Department of Home Affairs (South Africa)|Department of Home Affairs]])<ref>{{Cite web |title=SARS Klerksdorp Branch |url=https://www.sars.gov.za/sars-branch/klerksdorp/ |website=South African Revenue Service}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=DHA North West Branch Office |url=http://www.dha.gov.za/index.php/component/contact/category/22-provincial-managers/47-north-west |website=Department of Home Affairs}}</ref>

===Airport===
[[Klerksdorp Airport|P.C Pelser Airport]] is a medium-sized airport in South Africa, serving the region of Klerksdorp. The airport is mostly used by private local residents.

For scheduled international and domestic air services, Klerksdorp is currently served by [[O. R. Tambo International Airport|O.R Tambo International Airport]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=FAKD (Klerksdorp Airport) |url=https://skyvector.com/airport/FAKD/Klerksdorp-Airport |website=SkyVektor}}</ref>

===Roads===
The [[N12 (South Africa)|N12]] is the major freeway that runs through Klerksdorp.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Sanral begins immediate repairs on N12 in the North West |work=Engineering News |url=https://m.engineeringnews.co.za/article/sanral-begins-immediate-repairs-on-n12-in-the-north-west-2022-05-10}}</ref> Klerksdorp is also served by many regional roads. The R30 Road begins 16 kilometres north of [[Bloemfontein Central]] as an off-ramp of the [[N1 (South Africa)|N1 Highway]] (northbound only). From the [[R502 (South Africa)|R502 junction]], the R30 continues northwards for 12 kilometres to enter the city as Church Street (Passing through the city centre) and reach an intersection with the N12 Highway as Chris Hani Road. The [[R503 (South Africa)|R503]] is a Regional Route in North West that connects [[Mafikeng|Mahikeng]] with Klerksdorp via [[Lichtenburg, North West|Lichtenburg]] and [[Coligny, North West|Coligny]]. From [[Hartbeesfontein]], the R503 goes south-east for 20 kilometres to enter the city of Klerksdorp and reach its terminus at a T-junction with the N12 National Route in the suburb of Freemanvile (west of the town centre; north of Jouberton.

===Railway===
The first rail connection was that from [[Krugersdorp]] in 1897, the station was built by Netherlands–South African Railway Company and officially opened by [[Paul Kruger|President Kruger]] on the 3 August 1897. Just after the Anglo-Boer War, railway lines were extended to other parts of the country.

In 1905 the line was extended to [[Vierfontein]] and [[Kroonstad]]. In 1906 Veertienstrome line was opened connecting Klerksdorp and [[Cape Town]]. In 1928 the link with [[Hartbeesfontein|Hartebeesfontein]] and [[Ottosdal]] followed.<ref name=":3" />

After the discovery of gold, the government during the late 1880s and early 1890s was overwhelmed by the request of citizens of the town with electricity or gas. A concession for the supply of electricity was indeed granted to A. Barnard and A.P.J. Cronje.

However, due to the already mentioned slump in the gold mining industry, the further setback with rinderpest and the [[Second Boer War|Second Freedom War]], citizens were not fortunate enough to enjoy these luxuries early.

The power station was later enlarged and replaced in 1934 by a new scheme, which was erected at a cost of R65 000. Ten years later, in 1944, the city council decided to no longer operate its own power station and since then the power has been supplied to the Electricity Supply Commission (ESKOM).<ref name=":5" />
