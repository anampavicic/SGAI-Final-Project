'''Birgunj''' ({{langx|ne|वीरगञ्ज}}) is a metropolitan city in [[Parsa District]] in [[Madhes Pradesh]] in southern Nepal. It lies {{Convert|135|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the capital [[Kathmandu]], attached in the north to [[Raxaul]] on the border of the Indian [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Bihar]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cgibirgunj.org/page/detail/1|title=ABOUT BIRGUNJ|website=www.cgibirgunj.org|access-date=4 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712075706/http://www.cgibirgunj.org/page/detail/1|archive-date=12 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> As an entry point to Nepal from [[Patna]], Birganj is known as the "Gateway of Nepal". It is also called the "Commercial Capital of Nepal". The town has significant economic importance for Nepal as most of the trade with India is via Birganj and the Indian town of [[Raxaul]]. The [[Tribhuvan Highway]] links Birgunj to Nepal's capital, [[Kathmandu]].

Birgunj was one of the first three municipalities formed during the rule of Prime Minister [[Mohan Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana]]. It was declared a [[Metropolitan City]] on 22 May 2017 along with [[Biratnagar]] and [[Pokhara]]. Birgunj is one of the largest cities in Nepal and the largest in Madhesh Province. Birgunj is the fifth most populated [[metropolis]] of the nation.

==Etymology==
Birgunj was established as a conglomerate of several villages in and around Gahawa Mai Temple. Gahawa Mai Temple remains the epicenter of the town. The settlement was named after Rana Prime Minister [[Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana|Bir Shamsher]], thus acquiring the name Birgunj.

==History==

===Ancient===
Before the establishment of Birgunj, the main center of Parsa district was [[Alau, Nepal|Alau (near Dryport), Nepal]]. In July 1959 From Sugauli King [[Rajendra Bikram Shah]] has a history of setting up a military camp in Alau of Parsa district.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

The ancient name of Birgunj was Gahawa but the 11th Rana Prime Minister of Nepal [[Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] changed it to Birgunj in 1897. Before the establishment of Birgunj Bazar, the surrounding villages of Bagahi, Alau, Barewa, Kalaiya, Parsauni, Inaruwa, and Chhapkaiya existed. To establish Birgunj Bazar in a forest covered area, Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana appointed his trusted duo Siddhvir Mathema and Dhadjavir Mathema (two brothers), respectively in Birgunj as the rulers of Mal Ada and Kath Mal Ada. In this connection, Siddhvir Mathema distributed free land and timber and provided cash assistance to the homeowners in Birgunj. The act subsequently required Siddhvir Mathema to pay the death penalty.

After the death of Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana, [[Dev Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] became Prime Minister, but within three months [[Chandra Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] had driven Dev Shamsher and made himself Prime Minister. The people of Late Bir Shamsher Rana and Dev Shamsher Rana did not tolerate Chandra Shamsher Rana. Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana's special man Siddhivir Mathema, was accused of conducting an inspection of a reservoir treaty and carrying out three lakh irregularities on his forehead. When Siddhivir showed the calculations he had spent on setting up Birganj Bazar, he was declared invalid and an order was issued to pay the money immediately. After answering that he could not pay for what he did, As a punishment, the signboard was stuck on his chest and he move it around the market. The verbal verdict of the death sentence was to cut off and kill. After hearing about the verbal death sentence given to Mathema who worked day and night to establish Birgunj Bazar, Late Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana's wife has paid 3 lakh and rescued Mathema from the death penalty.

Chandra Shamsher also wanted to displace Birgunj Bazar, which his brother had established. He wanted to remove the Birgunj bazaar from there and set it in Rautahat. According to the move to displace the market, In 1959, it raided the main market from Raxaul to Birgunj and extended the rail line service to Amalekhganj. From the link, the train used to run around the houses, exploding and terrorizing the residents. Later, the rail link was moved to the east of the market (outside the market). The Raxaul city in India, which is currently connected to Birgunj as the main gateway to Nepal, was not established. At that time Indian trains operated only till Sugauli.<ref name="Birgunj Muncipality">{{cite web |title=How birgunj formed? |url=http://birgunjmun.gov.np/en |website=Birgunj Municipality Nepal |publisher=Nepal Government |access-date=6 April 2020 |archive-date=24 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324060045/http://birgunjmun.gov.np/en |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Modern===
On 18 May 2006, the parliament of Nepal declared that the country would become a secular state, prompting the [[2006 Birgunj unrest]].<ref>{{cite news |last = Sangraula |first = Bikash |title = Nepal faces Hindu backlash over declaration as secular state |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0530/p04s01-wosc.html |date = 30 May 2006 |newspaper = The Christian Science Monitor |access-date = 8 September 2020 |archive-date = 8 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200908001556/https://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0530/p04s01-wosc.html |url-status = live }}</ref> Birgunj was the main center from where [[Madhes Movement|Madhes movement]] started twice both in 2007 and 2013.

=== Surface and Ground Water ===
Sirsiya in the west and Singaha in the east are the two major rivers in Birgunj. Both rivers flow from north to south. During monsoon, these rivers are flooded and river bank cutting at the bends is common. The water level is very low in these rivers during winter. The depth of groundwater table is approximately between {{cvt|9–15|m}} deep with {{cvt|1–2|m}} fluctuation during wet and dry season.<ref>Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, Climatological Records (various volumes and years)</ref>

==Economy==
Birgunj is the Industrial and Commercial Capital of Nepal. Birgunj Chamber of Commerce & Industries is the leading and the oldest Chamber of Commerce & Industries in Nepal.

In 1964 when Birgunj Sugar Factory Ltd. was established by the Government of Nepal in collaboration with the Soviet Union (at present, Russia) with initial crushing capacity of 1,000 metric tons which later increased to 1,500 metric tons (Rajak, 2006). This was the first sugar mill established in the public sector. Later on, this mill was liquidated due to heavy losses.

Birgunj is a major business centre of Nepal, especially for trade with India. Almost all trade with India occurs through this route. The Indian border town of [[Raxaul]] has become one of the busiest towns for heavy transportation due to high trade volume. With a large number of industries set on the Birgunj-Pathlaiya industrial corridor, Birgunj produces a wide range of products such as pharmaceuticals, textiles, vegetable ghee, plastic, steel, cigarettes, aluminium, among others. Almost 56% of the total products of Birgunj are exported to the [[Indian state]] of [[Bihar]].<ref>CPS, NEPAL 2013, Annual UN Report Bureau.</ref>

Birgunj Customs holds a major contribution in terms of revenue earnings in the nation. On 16 July 2004 [[Birganj Inland Dry Port]] came in operation to improve trade operation and address the concerns in handling the large volume of goods.

The India-Nepal oil pipeline construction that began on 9 March 2018, saw its completion up to {{cvt|13|km}}. The {{convert|69|km|adj=on}} Amlekhgunj-Raxaul oil pipeline connecting the two countries has been laid along the Pathlaiya-Simara-Jitpur, Parwanipur and Birgunj bypass roadway. According to the reports, major part of the pipeline alignment is covered in the Birgunj-Pathlaiya commercial highway.<ref name="India, Nepal open South Asia's first cross-border oil pipeline">{{cite web |title=India, Nepal open South Asia's first cross-border oil pipeline |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/india-nepal-open-south-asia-cross-border-oil-pipeline-190910095511176.html |website=www.aljazeera.com |publisher=alzajeera |access-date=4 April 2020 |archive-date=8 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200408140322/https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/india-nepal-open-south-asia-cross-border-oil-pipeline-190910095511176.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Tourism==
Birgunj is main entry to Nepal. So, the city is widely visited by the Indians. There are good three-star hotels in the main centre of the city. These hotels operate some mini casinos as well.
[[File:Ghadiarwa-Park-Birgunj-04.jpg|alt=The decorative Ghadiarwa Pokhari during Chhath|thumb|The decorative Ghadiarwa Pokhari during Chhath|259x259px]]
During Chhath festival, Ghadiarwa Pokhari is visited by numerous people from different parts of the country. Vishwa Buddha Vihar is another religious place which is located in the out-skirts of the city. Vishwa is actually shaped like a stupa and has engravings of Buddha facing the cardinal directions of the universe. This place has a tranquil ambience and it attracts those tourists who want to flee the bustling life of the city. The term vishwa is derived from the word vicchu-wa, which is translated as a resting place for Bikshu(s) or Buddhist monks and means a resting place. In the ancient times, the pilgrims stopped at Birgunj in the midst of their journey between Lumbini and Bodh Gaya (India). The mound is protected by a boundary wall, and future excavations may well tell us about the history of not just Birgunj but also its importance to Buddhism 2,500 years ago.

The {{Convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} railway track from Raxaul to Birgunj was converted to [[broad gauge]] two years after the Indian railways converted the track to Raxaul inside India to broad gauge. Now, broad gauge railway line connects Raxaul to the [[Sirsiya]] (Birgunj) Inland Container Depot (ICD) that became fully operational in 2005. Talks have been held to reopen the railway route from Birgunj to Amlekhganj in Nepal by converting it to broad gauge because of its socio-economic importance.
