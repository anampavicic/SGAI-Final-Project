'''Cheonan''' ({{Korean|hangul=천안}}; {{IPA|ko|tɕʰʌ.nan|-|ko-Cheonan.ogg}}) is the largest and [[Population density|most densely populated]] [[List of cities in South Korea|city]] of [[South Chungcheong Province]], South Korea, and the third largest city in the [[Hoseo |Hoseo region]] after [[Daejeon]] and [[Cheongju]]. Cheonan borders [[Gyeonggi Province]] ([[Pyeongtaek]] and [[Anseong]]) in the north, [[North Chungcheong Province]] ([[Jincheon County]] and [[Cheongju]]) to the east and southeast, [[Sejong]] to the south and [[Asan]] and [[Gongju]] to the west and southwest.

Cheonan has been called "the core city of [the] nation" due to its location {{cvt|83.6|km}} south of the national capital, [[Seoul]], in the northeast corner of South Chungcheong, serving as a [[transportation hub]] to the [[Seoul Capital Area]] and surrounding regions.<ref name=GeneralInfo>{{cite web |url=http://www.cheonan.go.kr/EgovPageLink.do?link=/en/sub/sub01/sub_05 |title=General Information - Cheonan |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=City of Cheonan |access-date=4 February 2015 |archive-date=23 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221740/http://www.cheonan.go.kr/EgovPageLink.do?link=/en/sub/sub01/sub_05 |url-status=live }}</ref> Cheonan is connected to various [[Controlled-access highway|freeway]]s and [[railway]]s including the [[National highways of South Korea|National Highways]] 1 and 21, the [[Expressways in South Korea|Expressways]] [[Gyeongbu Expressway|1-Gyeongbu]] and [[Honam Expressway|25-Honam]], and the city's [[Korail]] station serves the [[Gyeongbu Line]] and the [[Janghang Line]], with services of the [[KTX]]. Cheonan is one of the furthest places from Seoul connected to the [[Seoul Subway Line 1]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://info.korail.com/2007/eng/eng_index.jsp |title=Korail Korea Railroad |access-date=2010-11-20 |archive-date=2012-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216195141/http://info.korail.com/2007/eng/eng_index.jsp |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==History==

Cheonan has always been a major transportation hub of Korea because of its proximity to Seoul and its location near a gap in the eastern mountain range ({{ill|Charyeong Range|ko|차령산맥}}) that allows passage through to the major southeast centers of Daegu and Busan. Cheonan's Samgeori (meaning "3-way intersection") park has been noted as a strategic point of transportation and a place where culture has spread for a long time. It is the place where Samnamdaero, which starts in Seoul, parts, leading one branch of the road through to the south-eastern Yeongnam region (which includes Gimcheon, Daegu, Gyeongju and Dongnae), and leading the other through Gongju and Nonsan to the Honam region (which includes Jeonju, Gwangju, Suncheon, and Yeosu).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cheonan.go.kr/EgovPageLink.do?link=/en/sub/sub02/sub_02 |title=Tour & Leisure - Cheonan |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=City of Cheonan |access-date=4 February 2015 |archive-date=23 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221744/http://www.cheonan.go.kr/EgovPageLink.do?link=/en/sub/sub02/sub_02 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Due to its strategic location, Cheonan has also been an important postal center where early communications from the south converged before heading to Seoul, or where messages from the capital diverged into the southern regions. More formal and structured mail services later emerged with the construction of the city's first postal outlets, and the entire history of mail service in Cheonan (and in South Korea in general since 1883) is now on display in the country's largest postal museum in Yang-ji-mal in eastern Cheonan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.postmuseum.go.kr |script-title=ko:우정박물관 |website=www.postmuseum.go.kr |access-date=2010-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117032058/http://www.postmuseum.go.kr/ |archive-date=2015-11-17 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Cheonan was a relatively small town for much of the early half of the 20th century. As a transportation center, it was the site of an early engagement in the [[Korean War]], the [[Battle of Cheonan]]. Then, in 1963 three municipal districts in the area that were growing in size were merged and promoted to the category of si, meaning city, by order of Law No 1176.<ref name=history>{{cite web |url=http://www.cheonan.go.kr/EgovPageLink.do?link=/en/sub/sub01/sub_02 |title=History - Cheonan |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=City of Cheonan |access-date=4 February 2015 |archive-date=23 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221738/http://www.cheonan.go.kr/EgovPageLink.do?link=/en/sub/sub01/sub_02 |url-status=live }}</ref> Thus the City of Cheonan was born, comprising the populations of Cheonan-gun, Cheonan-eup and Hwanseong-myeon. Over the next two decades, the city grew in size by incorporating neighboring populations, including that of Byeongcheon-myeon in 1973. In 1975 the city renamed 10 branch offices to 10 dongs, representing the major administrative regions of the city.<ref name=history/> The city continued to expand, absorbing neighboring ri, myeon, and eup, including Pungse-myeon and Guryong-ri in the early 80s. Throughout this time, new neighborhoods to the southwest that were collectively known as Cheonan-gun, such as Ssangbong-dong, also grew in population, and in 1995 Cheonan-gun and Cheonan-si were merged into one large Cheonan-si.<ref name=history/> Larger dong that comprised the city were subsequently separated into smaller factions, such as Ssangbong-dong into Bongmyong-dong and Ssangyong, which itself was later separated into Ssangyong 1(il)-dong and Ssangyong 2(i)-dong (and then again into Ssangyong 2(i)-dong and Ssangyong 3-dong in 2003). In 2002 a city ordinance promoted the northern fringe village of Jiksan-myeon and the southern fringe village of Mokcheon-myeon into Jiksan-eup and Mokcheon-eup.<ref name=history/> This extended the boundaries of the city to a span of approximately 16 kilometers from north (at Jiksan) to south (at Mokcheon), and about 12 kilometers from Sunmoon University in the west to Mount Taejo on the eastern fringe. Including all of its administrative regions (see below), the city now covers a total area of 636.25 km2.<ref name=GeneralInfo/>

==Geography==
[[File:Cheonan landscape.jpg|thumb|right|Cheonan from [[Taejosan]]]]
[[File:Silver Zone in Yeonamyulgeum-ro in Cheonan City 20240720 (04).jpg|thumb|Seobuk District]] 
The city is flanked to the east by the Charyeong Mountains, and spills out over plains and rolling hills to the west. Some of the mountains in the city's vicinity include Malloesan (611m), Seonggeosan (579m), Taejosan (422m), Heukseongsan (519m), Gwangdeoksan (699m), and Manggyeongsan (600m). The city itself is generally flat, with only a few areas, such as Anseon-dong, that are built up on hilly terrain.

To the west is the city of [[Asan]], to the north are the cities of [[Anseong]] and [[Pyeongtaek]] in [[Gyeonggi Province]], to the south is the county of [[Sejong]] and the city of [[Gongju]], and to the east of the city are the counties of [[Jincheon]] and [[Cheongwon]] in [[North Chungcheong Province]].

Cheonan is growing as a gateway to Chungcheongnam-do and a city behind the Seoul metropolitan area, located 83.6 kilometers south of Seoul on the highway. Gyeongbu Line connects north and south, and Janghang Line connects to the southwest. Land routes connect to Seoul, Daejeon, Sejong, Gongju, Asan, Jincheon, Pyeongtaek, and Anseong.

===Climate===
Cheonan has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dwa''), but can be considered a borderline [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cwa'') using the {{cvt|-3|C}} isotherm. The climate is similar to that of neighboring [[Seoul]], [[Suwon]], or [[Daejeon]], and is considered temperate Eastern margin with periods of monsoon. Cheonan experiences a four-season weather cycle, with moderately high summer temperatures and moderately low temperatures and snowfall in winter.

===Museums===
[[File:Independence Hall of Korea 01.JPG|thumb|Independence Hall of Korea]]
The [[Independence Hall of Korea]] is a visual history of the struggle for independence in Korea. Opened on August 15, 1987 and made possible by private donations, it is a meant both as a reminder of Korea's colonial past and as a means of building nationalist spirit. The hall stands on {{convert|980|acre|km2}} of landscaped grounds. As well as the exhibits, visitors can see the Grand Hall of the Nation, the Monument to the Nation, and the Unification Bell.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.i815.or.kr/EN/ |script-title=ko:Error Report - 독립기념관 |website=www.i815.or.kr}}</ref>

Cheonan's Postal Museum displays postal artifacts and material dating back to 1884, when the first postal services began. The entire history of the Korean postal service is on display, complete with photographs and letter carrying paraphernalia. The museum was not constructed here, but rather moved from [[Seoul]] in February 2004 to its current home in the Ministry of Information and Communication Officials Training Institute in Cheonan.

===Temples===
Gagwonsa Buddhist temple is located on Mt. Taejosan. Located on the temple grounds is a large bronze sitting [[Buddha]], which is 15m high, 30m in circumference, and weighs over 60 tonnes. The Buddha sits with the peak of Mt. Taejosan directly behind it, and faces west out over the city and valley. Worshippers and tourists alike climb the steep stairs from the base of the mountain.

Mt. Taejosan is also home to the smaller Seong-bul-sa temple.{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

In the southwest of the city, near the city's border with neighboring Asan, sits Hyeonchung-sa Temple, a large complex that houses a main temple and an elaborate garden. The temple was built by Confucian scholars and is a shrine to Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]] (his grave is located on the grounds). The temple and grounds also house a number of National Treasures.<ref>[http://hcs.go.kr/ Official temple website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103095523/http://hcs.go.kr/ |date=November 3, 2010 }}</ref>

===Parks===
Samgeori park has been a strategic point of transportation and a place where culture has spread for a long time. The Samnamdaero, which starts in Seoul, parts here. One branch of the road leads to the [[Yeongnam]] region. The other branch leads to the [[Honam]] region.

Haneulgeori is a resting area for the animal residents of Cheonan Samgeori Park, and it provides scenery for visitors with its willow trees and small pond.

Taejosan Park is located at Mt. Taejosan. The park covers an area of over 327,000 square meters. Visitors there may find a sculpture park, six camp sites, a grass field, tennis courts, and an outdoor performance area. There are many facilities for youths and families, and residents use the area for rest and relaxation. For hikers and day-walkers, there is also a very extensive trail network. The park also encompasses the Joabulsang Bronze Buddha statue and the Gagwonsa Buddhist Temple.

===Galleries===
Arario Gallery, reopened in 2002, is an addition to a revitalized Shinbu-dong area, which has become the central business district of Cheonan. The gallery itself showcases contemporary art from Korean and international artists. Organic works, including those painted with raw materials or organic substances (like fruit and vegetables) are the norm. The gallery's stated mission is to provide a special place for people of all ages and background to easily view and learn about art. There is also an installation of [[Damien Hirst]]'s "Hymn" in a glass box constructed as a part of the building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arariogallery.co.kr/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021220094625/http://www.arariogallery.co.kr/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 20, 2002 |title=ARARIO GALLERY |website=www.arariogallery.co.kr}}</ref>

To mark the historic March 1 Independence Movement,<ref>[[March 1 Movement|March 1st Movement]]</ref> characterized in Cheonan by [[Yu Gwansun]], each year a re-enactment of independence protests is staged at Aunae Marketplace. The popular movement began with the lighting of 24 beacons at Mt. Maebongsan and other mountains on March 31, 1919. The following day, 3,000 people gathered at Aunae Marketplace and protested for independence. Japanese security forces arrived and 19 people were shot dead on the spot, including Yu Gwansun's parents, with dozens more injured. These days people gather peacefully together in remembrance. Then a torch parade, symbolizing the lit beacons, slowly creeps from Aunae Market place through Byeongcheon and on to the Yu Gwansun Memorial.

On the eighth day of the fourth month of the [[Lunar Calendar]] each year, Buddhists celebrate the first coming of Buddha. In Cheonan, local temples decorate their buildings and grounds with illuminated paper lanterns, and much of the city centre is closed to traffic for a parade followed by musical acts and a traditional drumming show. Koreans often dress in their [[Hanbok]]s, a traditional Korean costume, and spend the day with friends and family wandering through the pedestrian-friendly streets and lanes on the city core.

The city is very well-connected to Seoul by road but also by train through two train stations. The first is [[Cheonan Station]] and the second, (served by the KTX high speed railway) is [[Cheonan-Asan Station]]. Different areas in Cheonan are also served by [[Seoul Subway Line 1]].

==Economy==
The local economy is fuelled to a great extent by tech sector companies in the area{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. Large national corporations such as [[Samsung]], [[LG Group]], [[Corning Inc.]], and several technology companies all have operations in Cheonan. The large number of universities also contributes to an influx of spending, as students from around Korea flock here for eight months of the year{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.

==Administrative districts and divisions==
Cheonan is divided into 2 ''gu'', and 16 administrative ''dong'' (subdivided into 30 distinct legal ''dong''), 4 ''eup'' and 8 ''myeon''.

The divisions of [[Dongnam District]] (Southeast) and [[Seobuk District]] (Northwest) are shown here:

==Population diversity==
Even with scores of Korean students graduating from the many tech programs at local universities, the demand for tech sector employees is still very high, and much of that demand is filled by foreign employees. The city is now home to a large foreign population, which has tripled over the past 5 years. There are more than 9,000<ref>[http://www.korea.net/News/News/NewsView.asp?serial_no=20080519008&part=109&SearchDay= Korea.net news article, May 19, 2008]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> foreigners residing in the Cheonan area.
