The [[Port of Corpus Christi]] is the fifth-largest in the United States. The region is served by the [[Corpus Christi International Airport]].

The city's name means [[Eucharist|body of Christ]] in [[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in reference to the Christian sacrament of Holy Communion. The name was given to the settlement and surrounding bay by Spanish explorer [[Alonso Álvarez de Pineda]] in 1519, as he discovered the lush semitropical bay on the Western Christian [[Corpus Christi (feast)|feast day of Corpus Christi]].

Corpus Christi is home to [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi]], one of two locations training primary student pilots and advanced multiengine pilots of the [[US Navy]], [[US Marine Corps]], and [[US Coast Guard]].

Spaniard Alonso Alvarez de Pineda traveled in 1519 to this bay on the day of the religious Feast of Corpus Christi, so named the semitropical bay Corpus Christi.<ref>{{cite web|date=May 9, 2017|title=The Spanish - Padre Island National Seashore|url=https://www.nps.gov/pais/learn/historyculture/spanish.htm|url-status=live|access-date=March 4, 2021|website=National Park Service|archive-date=April 3, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210403021618/https://www.nps.gov/pais/learn/historyculture/spanish.htm}}</ref>

[[Cabeza de Vaca]] may have passed through Corpus Christi in the 1500s, but the first European to study the Nueces River and Corpus Christi Bay was Joaquín de Orobio y Basterr in 1747. A few years later, [[José de Escandón]] organized a colony of about 50 families to settle the head of the bay, though this was short-lived.<ref name=tsha>{{cite web|series=Handbook of Texas Online|author=Long, Christopher Long|title=Corpus Christi, TX|access-date=May 26, 2018|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdc03|date=June 12, 2010|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|archive-date=July 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719113607/https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdc03|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1839, the first known permanent settlement of Corpus Christi was established by [[Colonel Henry Lawrence Kinney]] and William P. Aubrey as Kinney's Trading Post, or Kinney's Ranch. It was a small trading post that sold supplies to a Mexican revolutionary army camped about {{convert|25|mi|km|abbr=on}} west.<ref name="downtowncorpuschristi.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.downtowncorpuschristi.com/wiki/DMD/History |title=Corpus Christi, History, Historical, Interesting |publisher=Downtowncorpuschristi.com |access-date=2010-05-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318151134/http://downtowncorpuschristi.com/wiki/DMD/History |archive-date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>
In July 1845, U.S. troops commanded by General [[Zachary Taylor]] set up camp there in preparation for [[Mexican–American War|war with Mexico]], where they remained until March 1846.

The [[Battle of Corpus Christi]] was fought between August 12 and August 18, 1862, during the [[American Civil War]]. [[United States Navy]] forces blockading Texas fought a small land and sea engagement with [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces in and around Corpus Christi Bay and bombarded the city. [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces defeated [[Confederate States Navy]] ships operating in the area, but were repulsed when they landed on the coast.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qec03|title=TSHA &#124; Corpus Christi, Battle of|access-date=2017-06-25|archive-date=2019-10-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191022031739/https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qec03|url-status=live}}</ref>

In November 1873, seven Mexican shepherds were lynched by a mob near the city. The crime was never solved.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Carrigan|first1=William D|last2=Webb|first2=Clive|title=When Americans Lynched Mexicans|newspaper=The New York Times|date=20 February 2015}}</ref>

In February 1929, the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]] (LULAC) was founded in Corpus Christi. This organization was created to battle racial discrimination against Hispanic people in the United States. Since its founding, LULAC has grown and now has a national headquarters in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Orozco |first1=Cynthia |title=League of United Latin American Citizens |url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/league-of-united-latin-american-citizens |website=Texas State Historical Association |access-date=4 March 2024}}</ref>

In March 1949, the [[American GI Forum]] (AGIF) was founded in Corpus Christi. Currently, AGIF focuses on veteran's issues, education, and civil-rights issues. This organization was founded after concerns over the segregation of Mexican-American veterans from other veterans groups and the denial of medical services based on race by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]].

The [[1919 Florida Keys hurricane|1919 Storm]] devastated the city, killing hundreds on September 14. Only three structures survived the storm on North Beach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caller.com/columnists/murphy-givens/murphy-givens-storm-of-the-century-swept-across-north-beach-ep-358324482.html|title=MURPHY GIVENS: Storm of the century swept across North Beach|access-date=2016-04-18|archive-date=2015-09-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906042325/http://www.caller.com/columnists/murphy-givens/murphy-givens-storm-of-the-century-swept-across-north-beach-ep-358324482.html|url-status=live}}</ref> To protect the city, the seawall was built. The city also suffered damage from [[Hurricane Celia]] in 1970 and [[Hurricane Allen]] in 1980, but little damage from [[Hurricane Ike]] in 2008. In 2017, the city was affected by [[Hurricane Harvey]], then by [[Hurricane Hanna (2020)|Hurricane Hanna]] in 2020.

''Cisneros v. [[Corpus Christi Independent School District]]'' (1970) was the first case to extend the U.S. Supreme Court's ''Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas'' decision (1954) to Mexican Americans. It recognized them as a minority group that could be and was frequently discriminated against. Such segregation and discrimination were ruled unconstitutional. Judge Woodrow Seals found that the school board consciously fostered a system that perpetuated traditional segregation. This included a system that bused Anglo students to schools out of their neighborhoods, renovated old schools in black and Mexican-American neighborhoods rather than building new ones, assigned black and Hispanic teachers to segregated schools, and limited hiring of such teachers at other schools; the school board also lacked a majority-to-minority busing system.<ref>{{cite news|title=CISNEROS V.

==Geography ==

Corpus Christi is situated on [[fluvial]] deposits that are of [[Holocene]]—[[Pleistocene]] age. Although no solidified rock occurs naturally at the surface,<ref>texascoastgeology.com</ref> the Deweyville Formation of [[sand]], [[silt]], [[clay]], and [[gravel]], is locally indurated with [[calcium carbonate]] ([[caliche]]) deposits.  In 2017, Hurricane Harvey's storm surge eroded down to shale bedrock at a depth around 40 feet in Packery Channel, an artificial pass cut between North Padre and Mustang Islands. This feature has become a gathering place for game fish, and can be identified from the surface by its whirlpool-like current. The large, shallow bay makes Corpus Christi an ideal feeding place for birds, which is one reason why Corpus Christi is known as the "Bird Capital" of North America.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} Consequently, the San Diego Audubon Society has designated  Corpus Christi as "America's birdiest place".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.caller.com/sports/outdoors/add-hawkiest-to-our-birdiest-city-distinction-3cdce570-14ca-09b1-e053-0100007f5b74-394306171.html|title=Add hawkiest to our birdiest city distinction|access-date=2017-05-04|archive-date=2017-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826031400/http://archive.caller.com/sports/outdoors/add-hawkiest-to-our-birdiest-city-distinction-3cdce570-14ca-09b1-e053-0100007f5b74-394306171.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Corpus Christi has a total area of 460.2 square miles (1,192.0&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), of which 154.6&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup> (400.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, 33.60%) are land and 305.6&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup> (791.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, 66.40%) are covered by water.

===Annexation===
Since its founding, the city has annexed nearby lands and waters for growth and development purposes. The original area encompassed several city blocks in present-day downtown Corpus Christi with the majority of city expansion occurring in the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|title=City Annexation Map|url=http://www.cctexas.com/Assets/Departments/Development-Services/Files/digital-maps/Annexation%20by%20decade.pdf|publisher=City of Corpus Christi|access-date=2 January 2015|archive-date=14 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114215250/http://www.cctexas.com/Assets/Departments/Development-Services/Files/digital-maps/Annexation%20by%20decade.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Climate===

Corpus Christi has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: Cfa), with hot and humid summers, and short mild winters. The period from November through February is the coolest time of year in the city, while June through September is the hottest.  October is still hot, but not as hot as the summer months. Rainfall is spread throughout the year, and there is rarely ever snow or ice.

The city's record high temperature is {{convert|109|°F|°C}}, on September 5, 2000, and the hottest month August 2012 with an average of {{convert|88.3|°F|°C|1}}. Average night-time winter lows in January, the coldest month, are a little less than {{convert|50|°F|°C}} and its record low is {{convert|11|°F|°C}} on February 12, 1899. The coldest maximum of {{convert|26|°F|°C}} occurred on five occasions, the most recent being on January 30, 1951.{{refn|The other cases of a {{convert|26|°F|°C}} maximum have been December 20, 1924, February 12, 1899, January 25, 1897, and January 16, 1888.|group="nb"}} Winter and early spring are generally dry, and average monthly precipitation is highest in September, when the threat from [[hurricanes]] and other tropical weather systems is greatest. The coolest month on record has been February 1905, with a mean of {{convert|45.6|°F|°C|1|}}. In December 2004, the city experienced snowfall on Christmas Eve, the city's largest recorded snowstorm at {{convert|4.4|in|cm|abbr=on}}. The snow melted the day after Christmas.  The city experienced light snowfall a second time, on December 8, 2017, nearly 13 years later.

Between 1981 and 2010, Corpus Christi averaged {{convert|31.73|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rainfall; however, long periods with very little rainfall are normal, and hurricanes can frequently produce daily falls of over {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}}. The wettest day on record is July 2, 2007, with {{convert|9.86|in|mm|disp=or}}, while the wettest month on record is September 1967, with {{convert|20.33|in|mm|abbr=on}}, including four days with over {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}}. Eight months with not even a trace of rainfall have happened, of which the most recent was May 1998, and 21 with merely a trace. The longest spell without measurable rainfall in Corpus Christi has been 55 days from June 23 to August 17 (inclusive), 1895, and from June 1 to July 25, 1915, while easily the driest calendar year has been 1917, with a mere {{convert|5.38|in|mm|abbr=on}}. The two wettest calendar years have been 1888 with {{convert|48.16|in|mm|abbr=on}} and 1991 with {{convert|48.07|in|mm|abbr=on}}, although from August 1967 to July 1968, {{convert|59.09|in|mm|abbr=on}} fell, and for the 12 months ending January 1918, only {{convert|5.22|in|mm|abbr=on}}.

Hurricanes seldom hit the city, but those which have were destructive, such as the [[1919 Florida Keys hurricane]] and [[Hurricane Harvey]] in 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/aug/26/hurricane-harvey-makes-landfall-in-texas-latest-updates|title=Hurricane Harvey makes landfall in Texas|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=26 August 2017|archive-date=26 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826024231/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/aug/26/hurricane-harvey-makes-landfall-in-texas-latest-updates|url-status=live}}</ref> The city also can see [[tornadoes]], with an F2 tornado hitting the area on [[Tornado outbreak sequence of April 23–30, 1961|April 29, 1961]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Tornado History Project: 19610429.48.37 |url=http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/19610429.48.37 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128064146/http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/19610429.48.37 |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 28, 2011 |website=www.tornadohistoryproject.com |access-date=21 July 2020 }}</ref>

===Water===
Drinking water for the city is supplied by three reservoirs, [[Lake Corpus Christi]], the [[Choke Canyon Reservoir]], and [[Lake Texana]]. Through an effective regional partnership with the [[Nueces River]] Authority and the Port of Corpus Christi Authority, a {{convert|101|mi|km|adj=on|abbr=on}} pipeline was built which transports water from Lake Texana to the city's O.N. Stevens Water Treatment Plant. It was named the Mary Rhodes Pipeline, after the late mayor. Phase two of the pipeline is underway to draw water from the Colorado River.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mary Rhodes Pipeline Phase 2 Project Fact Sheet|url=http://www.engineercc.com/library/pdf/MaryRhodes_Pipeline_Ph2_FactSheet.pdf|access-date=15 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929192932/http://www.engineercc.com/library/pdf/MaryRhodes_Pipeline_Ph2_FactSheet.pdf|archive-date=2015-09-29|url-status=dead}}</ref> All reservoirs are outside the city limits, but Lake Corpus Christi and Choke Canyon Reservoir are managed directly by the public utility of the City of Corpus Christi. To support future water needs, plans are being completed to build a desalinization plant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texasdesal.com/news-updates/item/411-corpus-christi-moving-nearer-construction-of-desalination-plant.html|title=CORPUS CHRISTI MOVING NEARER CONSTRUCTION OF DESALINATION PLANT|access-date=16 August 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930063231/http://www.texasdesal.com/news-updates/item/411-corpus-christi-moving-nearer-construction-of-desalination-plant.html|archive-date=30 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Baddour |first=Dylan |date=2022-10-29 |title=Black residents in Corpus Christi file a civil rights complaint to stop Texas' first desalination plant |url=https://www.texastribune.org/2022/10/29/texas-corpus-christi-hillcrest-desalination-plant/ |access-date=2022-11-04 |work=The Texas Tribune |language=en |agency=Inside Climate News}}</ref>{{r|AT 2022-11-04}}
