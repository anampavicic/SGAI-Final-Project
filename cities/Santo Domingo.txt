'''Santo Domingo''' ({{IPA|es|ˈsanto ðoˈmiŋɡo}} meaning "[[Saint Dominic]]" but verbatim "Holy Sunday"), once known as '''Santo Domingo de Guzmán''', known as '''Ciudad Trujillo''' between 1936 and 1961, is the capital and largest city of the [[Dominican Republic]] and the [[List of metropolitan areas in the West Indies|largest metropolitan area]] in the [[Caribbean]] by population.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bourne |first=Kevin |title=Local government in the Caribbean |url=http://www.citymayors.com/government/caribbean-local-government.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230406033528/http://www.citymayors.com/government/caribbean-local-government.html |archive-date=Apr 6, 2023 |website=City Mayors}}</ref> {{As of|2022|post=,}} the city and immediate surrounding area (the [[Distrito Nacional]]) had a population of 1,029,110 while the total population is 3,798,699 when including [[Greater Santo Domingo]] (the "[[metropolitan area]]"). The city is coterminous with the boundaries of the [[Distrito Nacional]] ("D.N.", "National District"), itself bordered on three sides by [[Santo Domingo Province]].

Founded by the Spanish in 1496, on the east bank of the [[Ozama River]] and then moved by [[Nicolás de Ovando]] in 1502 to the west bank of the river, the city is the oldest continuously inhabited [[European colonization of the Americas|European settlement in the Americas]], and was the first seat of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial rule]] in the [[New World]], the [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo]]. It is the site of the first university, cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in the [[New World]].

Following his assassination, the city resumed its original designation.

Santo Domingo is the [[Culture of Dominican Republic|cultural]], financial, political, commercial and industrial center of the Dominican Republic, with the vast majority of the country's most important industries being located within the city. Santo Domingo also serves as the chief seaport of the country. The city's harbor at the mouth of the Ozama River accommodates the largest vessels, and the port handles both heavy passenger and freight traffic.

The French imported slaves to work on plantations in their colonies in [[Saint-Domingue]], and they were exploited until the [[French Revolution]] of 1789. Former plantation slave [[Toussaint L'ouverture]] led an uprising of slaves in 1791, arming them with French weapons.{{cn}} They allied with Spain and raided the colony from Santo Domingo, but in 1794 the French revolutionary government capitulated to Toussaint and made him a Brigadier-General. The [[Haitian Revolution|Haitian revolutionaries]], now allied with France, fought against attempts by the [[Spanish Armed Forces|Spanish military]] to capture Saint-Domingue amidst the confusion.{{cn}}

However, the French failed to consolidate this cession, mainly because of the continued presence of British troops in Saint-Domingue (they remained until 1798). As the news of Santo Domingo's cession became known on the island, many Dominicans had sided with Britain against France, welcoming British ships into their ports, pledging allegiance to the British in exchange for protection, and enlisting in the [[British Armed Forces|British military]].<ref>{{cite book|title=An Islandwide Struggle for Freedom: Revolution, Emancipation, and Reenslavement in Hispaniola, 1789–1809|page=93}}</ref>-->

From 1795 to 1822, the city changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795. The city was briefly captured by Haitian rebels in 1801, recovered by France in 1802, [[Siege of Santo Domingo (1805)|endured a failed invasion from Haiti]] in 1805, and was once again reclaimed by Spain in 1809. In 1821, Santo Domingo became the capital of an independent nation called the [[Republic of Spanish Haiti]] after the [[Criollo people|Criollo]] bourgeois within the country, led by [[José Núñez de Cáceres]], overthrew the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish crown]]. The nation was annexed by Haiti just two months later. The city and the colony lost much of their Spanish-born [[Peninsulars|peninsular]] population as a result of these events which caused a great deal of instability and unrest.<ref name=loc3/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/sshl/resources/featured-collections/latin-american-elections-statistics/dominican-republic/elections-and-events-17911849.html |title=Elections and Events 1791–1849 |access-date=2009-03-18 |publisher=[[University of California-San Diego]]}}</ref><ref>Mary Louise Pratt, Imperial Eyes, 2007, p. 70</ref>

On 27 February 1844, Santo Domingo was again the capital of a free nation, when it gained its independence from Haiti, led by Dominican nationalist [[Juan Pablo Duarte]]. The city was a prize fought over by various political factions over the succeeding decades of instability. In addition, the country had to fight multiple battles with Haiti; the [[Battle of 19 March]], [[Battle of 30 March]], [[Battle of Las Carreras]], and [[Battle of Beler]], are a few of the most prominent encounters, mentioned in the national anthem and with city streets named after them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.colonialzone-dr.com/stodgo_map-lenin.pdf |title=City street map of Santo Domingo at www.colonialzone-dr.com |access-date=2009-03-20}}</ref> Dominican victory in these engagements thwarted the advance of the Haitian army towards Santo Domingo during the [[Dominican War of Independence]].

In 1861, Spain returned to the country, having struck a bargain with Dominican dictator [[Pedro Santana]] whereby the latter was granted several honorific titles and privileges, in exchange for annexing the young nation back to Spanish rule. The [[Dominican Restoration War]] began in 1863 however, and in 1865 the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] Queen [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] withdrew her soldiers from the island.

Over the next two-thirds of a century Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic went through many revolutions and power changes. Santo Domingo would experience the first of two [[United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916–1924)|U.S. invasions]] in 1916 when different leaders fought for presidential power and control of the city. The United States intervened, instituting a military leader, [[Harry Shepard Knapp]].

Following his assassination in 1961 the city was renamed back to Santo Domingo.

In 1962, [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]] was elected to the presidency. He was overthrown seven months later, resulting in a [[Dominican Civil War|civil war]] in the capital. [[Francisco Caamaño]] led the ''Constitucionalistas'' fighting to restore democracy. This would lead to the second U.S. invasion in 1965. U.S. troops engaged in heavy fighting in the streets of Santo Domingo against the ''Constitucionalistas'' on June 15 and June 16. [[Newsweek]] described it this way:
{{blockquote|Amid the clatter of automatic weapons, the sharp rattle of .50-caliber guns and the heavy explosions of bazookas and recoilless rifles, the paratroopers of the [[82nd Airborne Division|82nd U.S. Airborne Division]] blasted their way four city blocks into Caamaño's bastion. Heavy fire from U.S. guns across the Ozama River ringed rebel headquarters on El Conde Street, shattered buildings and started huge fires.}}

Eventually, the fighting would end on August 31, 1965, with 2,850 Dominicans and 44 American servicemen dead.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Palmer|first1=Bruce|title=Intervention in the Caribbean: The Dominican Crisis of 1965|date=2015|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=9780813150024|page=137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I5UfBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA137}}</ref>

{{expand section|date=November 2022}}
[[File:Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.jpg|thumb|right|View of Santo Domingo from space, 2010.]]
<!--which side is which?-->
The [[Ozama River]] flows {{convert|148|km|0|abbr=off|sp=us}} before emptying into the Caribbean Sea. Santo Domingo's position on its banks was of great importance to the city's economic development and the growth of trade during colonial times. The Ozama River is where the country's busiest port is located.

===Climate===
The average temperature in Santo Domingo varies little, because the [[Tropics|tropical]] [[trade wind]]s help mitigate the heat and humidity throughout the year. Thanks to these trade winds, Santo Domingo has a borderline [[tropical rainforest climate|tropical rainforest]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Af'')/[[tropical monsoon climate]] (''Am''), as its driest month is very close to {{convert|60|mm|in|sp=us}}. However, the city seldom experiences the heat that one may expect to find. December through March are the coolest months with warm days with less humidity and cool nights (temperatures of {{convert|17|to|19|C|F|abbr=on}}). July through September are the hottest. Santo Domingo averages {{convert|1445|mm|in|sp=us}} of rain annually. Its driest months are from December through April; however, due to the trade winds and mountains to the southwest, rain is seen even during these months.

Like many other cities in the [[Caribbean]], Santo Domingo is very susceptible to hurricanes. [[Hurricane Georges]] caused severe destruction in September 1998. The lowest recorded temperature has been {{convert|11.0|C|F}} on 5 February 1951 and 7 January 1957 and the highest is {{convert|39.5|C|F}} on 29 May 2002.<ref name=records>{{cite web |first1=Mariela |last1=Mejía |url=http://www.diariolibre.com/noticias/2011/01/07/i274915_frio-extremo-calor-agobiante.html |title=Frío extremo, calor agobiante |publisher=Diario Libre |language=es |date=7 January 2011 |access-date=2 May 2017 |archive-date=4 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104214132/http://www.diariolibre.com/noticias/2011/01/07/i274915_frio-extremo-calor-agobiante.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

{{See also|List of colonial buildings in Santo Domingo|Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)}}
[[File:Columbus-Park-Dominican-Republic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Parque Colón]]

Many of Santo Domingo's most notable landmarks are located within the [[Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)|Zona Colonial]] district of the city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990. The Colonial Zone, bordered by the Río Ozama, also has a collection of early 16th century buildings, including palatial houses and majestic churches that reflect the architectural style of the [[late Middle Ages]]. The [[Church and Convent of los Dominicos]] is the oldest Catholic building in continuous use in the [[Americas]], and was the headquarters of the [[List of colonial universities in Hispanic America|first university in the Americas]].<ref name="whc.unesco.org"/>

The city's most important historical buildings include the [[Catedral Santa María La Menor]], the first cathedral of the Americas, which states its distinction; the [[Alcázar de Colón]], the first castle in the Americas, once the residence of [[List of viceroys of New Spain|Viceroy of the Indies]] Don [[Diego Colón]], a son of Christopher Columbus; the [[Monasterio de San Francisco]], the ruins of the first [[monastery]] in the Americas; the [[Museo de las Casas Reales]], in a monumental complex that includes the former Palace of the [[List of colonial governors of Santo Domingo|Governors]] and the building of the former [[Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo]]; the [[Fortaleza Ozama]], is one of the surviving sections of the Walls of Santo Domingo, which is the oldest military construction of European origin in the Americas; the [[National Pantheon of the Dominican Republic|Pantéon Nacional]], a former [[Jesuit]] edifice now hosting the remains of various renowned Dominicans; and the [[Church and Convent of los Dominicos|Dominican Convent]], the first convent in the Americas.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

On the north end of Calle Las Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de España is bordered by Las Atarazanas (former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. This area was the first European commercial center in the Americas, and is still a hub of activity today. The [[Alcázar de Colón]], having once been the colonial palace of the [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] family – beginning with his son Diego – is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 1952.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

A 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned marina. The project is being completed by Sans Soucí Ports S.A.

===Neighborhoods===
{{See also|Distrito Nacional}}
[[File:Sectors of the Distrito Nacional.png|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Neighborhoods of Santo Domingo.]]
The city proper of Santo Domingo is subdivided into incorporated areas (neighborhoods) called ''sectores'' which could be considered as small urban towns. All ''sectores'' are serviced directly by the [[Mayor|municipal mayor's office]].

'''Sector regions''':
* '''''Ciudad (city)''''' – applies to the original older parts of town, many of which date back to the colonial times.
* '''''Ensanche''''' (lit. "widening") – usually, but not always, applied to the more "modern" parts of the city.
* '''''Villa (village)''''' – the urban outskirts of both the old city of Santo Domingo and the current (smaller) National District; originally they were separate villages, hence their names.

==Government and politics==
[[File:National Palace Dominican Republic.jpg|thumb|The [[National Palace (Dominican Republic)|National Palace]], in Santo Domingo]]
Santo Domingo is the center of the national government of the Dominican Republic. The President's office and ministries, National Congress, Supreme Court of Justice, and other main government institutions are located in the metropolitan area.

The city is administered by the ''Ayuntamiento del Distrito Nacional'' (City Hall), which is responsible for municipal functions.<ref name="MoréBergdoll2010">{{cite book|last1=Moré|first1=Gustavo Luis|last2=Bergdoll|first2=Barry|title=Caribbean Modernist Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CgI9cMHsSPIC&pg=RA1-PA8|access-date=4 June 2012|date=30 June 2010|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art|isbn=978-0-87070-775-9|page=8}}</ref> The current mayor of Santo Domingo is Carolina Mejía de Garrigó.

The "Policía Nacional" (National Police) and "Policia Turística" (Tourist Police) (POLITUR) are tasked with enforcing city safety.

==Economy==
{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2022}}
[[File:Dominican Republic Banks.jpg|thumb|upright|Reserve Bank of the Dominican Republic (BanReservas) in Santo Domingo.]]

The city is the center of economic activity in the Dominican Republic. It is where most of the country's wealth is concentrated and the seat of the national legislature, judicial, and executive government. Many national and international firms have their headquarters or regional offices in Santo Domingo. The city attracts many international firms and franchises such as Ikea, Goldcorp and Barrick due to its location and economic stability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:20421402~pagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html#Lower_middle_income |title=Country and Lending Groups |access-date=11 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524215837/http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0%2C%2CcontentMDK%3A20421402~pagePK%3A64133150~piPK%3A64133175~theSitePK%3A239419%2C00.html |archive-date=24 May 2008 }}</ref>

The infrastructure is suitable for most business operations. A key element that has helped the city grow and compete globally is the telecommunications infrastructure. Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic as a whole enjoy a modern and extensive telecommunications system liberalized in the late 1990s which has benefited from extensive foreign investment. This has attracted numerous call centers in recent years. Santo Domingo not only has an excellent telecommunications infrastructure but also a sizeable bilingual population that speaks English.

The city's economic growth can be witnessed in the extensive vertical growth experienced across many of its neighborhoods. The construction boom is reflected in the many high density residential towers, shopping malls, elevated highways, the metro expansion and overall increase in commercial activity.

Santo Domingo has a thriving middle class contrasting with the significant pockets of poverty that remain as challenges for the future. Marginalized slum conditions exist mostly in the northeast quadrant of the city with smaller pockets extending across the city. Areas of extensive development include the [[Poligono Central]], which is bordered by the Avenida John F. Kennedy northward 27 February Avenue south, Avenida Winston Churchill to the west and Avenida Máximo Gómez to the east, and is characterized by its mixed development and its very active nightlife.

Santo Domingo has areas of high development, among them Serralles, Naco, Arroyo Hondo, Piantini, Urb Fernandez, Ens. Julieta, Paraiso, Los Prados, Bella Vista, Sarasota and other sectors, where most of the middle class can be found.

Bella Vista and La Esperilla are currently the fastest growing sectors with large mega -projects. Gazcue belongs to the more traditional southeastern area of the city and is known for its buildings dating from the 1930s to the 1960s.

==Culture==
The [[performing arts]] are very important in Santo Domingo. The city has its own [[National Symphony Orchestra (Dominican Republic)|symphonic orchestra]], chamber orchestra, opera company, ballet company, folkloric company, and [[Teatro Nacional (Santo Domingo)|national theater]], including a number of smaller groups. The Plaza of culture is the center of activity, but there are concerts, ballet, folklore, and other performances throughout the city. Casa de Teatro is the gathering place of avant garde artists, actors, and musicians. It stages art and literature exhibitions and offers painting, drama, and dancing courses and monthly contests for poetry, short stories, and other forms of literature.

Plaza de la Cultura also houses the city's most important cultural venues, including the [[Teatro Nacional (Santo Domingo)|Teatro Nacional]] (National Theater) and various museums; the [[National Palace (Dominican Republic)|Palacio Nacional]], which houses the Presidency of the Dominican Republic; the Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts), a neoclassical building that is the permanent home of the country's National Symphony Orchestra; and the Boulevard 27 de Febrero, a pedestrian promenade located on the busy Avenida 27 de Febrero, which displays works of art from prominent Dominican artists and sculptors. Another attraction is the [[Centro Olímpico Juan Pablo Duarte]], a sports complex in the center of Santo Domingo. This complex was used during the [[2003 Pan American Games]].

In the Plaza de la Cultura are the Museum of the Dominican Man, with artifacts from the pre-Columbian [[Taíno people|Taíno]] civilization, the National Museum of History and Geography, the Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Modern Art. Other museums include the [[Museo Bellapart]], a prominent private collection of 19th- and 20th-Century Dominican painting and sculpture and the Museo Prehispanico, a major private collection of pre-Columbian [[Taíno]] art.<ref name="HarveyFullman2009">{{cite book|last1=Harvey|first1=Sean|last2=Fullman|first2=Joe|title=The Rough Guide to the Dominican Republic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ffcpuDEw8p8C&pg=PA90|access-date=4 June 2012|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-85828-811-6|page=90}}</ref>

==Transportation==

[[File:Stodgo metro.jpg|thumb|[[Santo Domingo Metro]]]]

Santo Domingo has an underground and elevated [[rapid transit]] metro system. It is the most extensive metro in the [[Caribbean]] and Central American region by total length and number of stations.<ref name="List of metro systems">See [[List of metro systems]]</ref> The [[Santo Domingo Metro]] is part of a major "National Master Plan" to improve transportation in the city as well as the rest of the nation.  The first line was planned to relieve traffic congestion in the [[DR-1|Máximo Gómez]] and [[DR-13|Hermanas Mirabal Avenue]]. The second line, which opened in April 2013, is meant to relieve the congestion along the [[DR-13|Duarte-Kennedy-Centenario]] Corridor in the city from west to east.
