==History==
===Taino Period===
The department was part of the Chiefdom of Marien with settlements such as Guarico in Limonade and Guanawari in Grande-Rivière-du-Nord.

===Spanish Period===
After the arrival of Columbus, the Taino granted the Spanish land to build the fort Navidad with their shipwreck, the first Colombian-era shelter built by Europeans in America. The fort was destroyed by Caonabo, leader of the Maguana, in response to the Europeans abusing their stay and locals. The Europeans moved eastward to actual la Isabella in the Dominican Republic.

===French Period===
After the treaty of Ryswick, the French administer the west side of the island. The capital of the colony from 1697 to 1751 has been Cap-François, the actual Cap-Haitian.
The department was the most densely populated with enslaved Africain, making it the beginning with the [[Bois Caïman|Bwa-Kayiman]] and the end with the [[Battle of Vertières]] of the Haitian Revolution.
In [[1789]] the Nord Department on the northern shore was the most fertile area with the largest sugar plantations. It was an area of vast economic importance. Here most of the slaves lived in relative isolation, separated from the rest of the colony by a high mountain range known as the ''Massif''. This area was a stronghold of the wealthy planters who wanted greater autonomy for the colony, especially economically, so they could do as they pleased.<ref name="caribbean">{{cite book

===Haitian Revolution===
Many rebellions have taken place in Haiti notably in the North even before 1791 such as the Makandal Rebellion or the Ogé and Chavannes Insurrection. August 1791 becomes important as a Jamaican maroon Duty Boukmann and manbo or Vodoun priestess Cecile Fatiman organized the enslaved from different African nations. One week after that Congress and essentially what some scholars call the first Haitian Vodoun ceremony the general rebellion has started being led by Toussaint, Dessalines, Papillon, Biassou and many more.
Within the next ten days slaves had taken control of the entire northern province in an unprecedented slave revolt that left the whites controlling only a few isolated fortified camps. Within the next two months as the violence escalated, the rebelling slaves killed 2,000 whites and burned or destroyed 280 sugar plantations.<ref name="brief">{{cite book

The Haitians manage to get the complete abolition of slavery with Toussaint's fight, Polverel, and Sonthonax, although many whites and some mulattoes were not satisfied with the outcome. Some blacks were also not satisfied since Toussaint establish strict discipline to cultivate the land and he also reinvite some whites to come back to St-Domingue.

When the expedition arrived in Haiti and Leclerc asked Christophe for a safe harbor for his military vessels and control over Cap-Haitien. After he refuses, in response he burns his own house, then burns the city and runs to the Cap mountains.

After Toussaint's capture, Dessalines and Pétion had a meeting in Plaisance to form the [[Armée Indigène|Indigènes Army]] and the collective focus shifted from liberty and abolition of slavery to Independence.

On November 18, 1803, the [[Battle of Vertières]] outside of the city of Le Cap was the last battle in the war for Independence. The glorious and courageous capacity of Dessalines, Cappoix, Christophe, Gabart, and more led to January 1, 1804.

===Haitian Period===
