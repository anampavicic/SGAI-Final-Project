=== Chumash/pre-colonial period ===

[[File:Pictographs at the Burro Flats Painted Cave.png|thumb|left|Pictographs in the [[Burro Flats Painted Cave]], which was a [[winter solstice]] observatory for the [[Chumash people|Chumash]]]]
Simi Valley was once inhabited by the [[Chumash people]], who also settled much of the region from the [[Salinas Valley]] to the [[Santa Monica Mountains]], with their presence dating back thousands of years.<ref>Starr, Kevin. 2007.

Roughly 2,000 years later, as hunting and fishing techniques improved, the population increased significantly.<ref name="Johnson, John R 1997.

Simi Valley's name is derived from the Chumash word Shimiyi, which refers to the stringy, thread-like clouds that typify the [[North America|region]].<ref>Kroeber, Alfred Louis. 1917.

Robert Harrington later explained the name: ''"The word Simiji in Indian meant the little white wind clouds so often seen when the wind blows up here and Indians living on the coast, would never venture up here when those wind clouds were in the sky. The word Simiji was constructed by whites to the word Simi. There are other explanations about the name Simi, but this one was given to me by my brother who worked over 40 years for the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and it seems most plausible to me"''.<ref>Harrington, Robert E. 1969.

=== The Rancho period ===
[[File:Simi Adobe, Simi Valley.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rancho Simi]] was granted in 1795 to the [[Pico family of California]]. Pictured is the [[Simi Adobe–Strathearn House|Simi Adobe]].]]
[[File:José_de_la_Guerra_y_Noriega_(cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Simi Valley was part of [[Rancho Simi]], owned by Don [[José de la Guerra y Noriega]], founder of the prominent [[Guerra family of California]].]]
The first Europeans to visit Simi Valley were members of the Spanish [[Portolá expedition]] (1769–1770), the first European land entry and exploration of the present-day state of [[California]]. The expedition traversed the valley on January 13–14, 1770, traveling from [[Conejo Valley]] to San Fernando Valley. They camped near a native village in the valley on the 14th.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bolton |first=Herbert E. |year=1927 |pages=267–268|title=Fray Juan Crespi: Missionary Explorer on the Pacific Coast, 1769–1774 |url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000288788 |publisher=HathiTrust Digital Library |access-date=July 31, 2014}}</ref>

[[Rancho Simi|Rancho Simí]], also known as Rancho San José de Nuestra Señora de Altagracia y Simí,<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Havens, Patricia.|title=Simi Valley : a journey through time|date=1997|publisher=Simi Valley Historical Society and Museum|others=Appleton, Bill., Simi Valley Historical Society and Museum.|isbn=0-9659442-0-4|edition=1st|location=Simi Valley, Calif.|oclc=38156148}}</ref> was a  {{convert|113009|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} [[Ranchos of California|Spanish land grant]] in eastern [[Ventura County, California|Ventura]] and western [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]] counties granted in 1795 to Santiago Pico.

The [[Simi Adobe-Strathearn House]], later the home of Robert P. Strathearn and family, served as the headquarters of the rancho.

[[José de la Guerra y Noriega]], a Captain of the [[Presidio of Santa Barbara|Santa Barbara Presidio]], who had begun to acquire large amounts of land in California to raise cattle, purchased Rancho Simí from the Pico family in 1842.  After Jose de la Guerra death in 1858, the sons of Jose de la Guerra continued to operate the ranchos.  The end of their prosperity came when several years of drought in the 1860s caused heavy losses.  In 1865, the De la Guerras lost the ownership of El Rancho Simí excluding the Rancho Tapo.  El Rancho Tapo was part of the original 113,009-acre Rancho Simí grant, but sometime around 1820–1830, the Rancho Tapo came to be thought of as a separate place within Rancho Simí.<ref name=":1" /> The last of the De la Guerras to live in Simí Valley retreated to a 14,400-acre portion of the original rancho that was known as the Tapo Rancho.  As late as February 1877, Juan De la Guerra was reported in county newspapers to be preparing to plant walnuts in the Tapo, which appears to be the final mention of their farming in relation to the original Simí grant.

The De la Guerra heirs tried every legal means, but by the 1880s, the Rancho Tapo also slipped from their ownership, as had the rest of the Rancho.<ref name=":1"/>

=== The Pioneer period ===
The Pioneer, or 'American,' period in Simi Valley began with the 96,000-acre purchase of El Rancho Simí by an eastern speculator named [[Thomas Alexander Scott|Thomas A. Scott]] (1814–1882), who had made his money as an investor in the Pennsylvania Railroad during the Civil War. He was president of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], and a partner in Philadelphia and California Petroleum Company.  Scouts came to California to purchase lands, and thus Scott acquired El Rancho Simí (1865). His goal was to locate sites for oil, since the first oil well had been developed in Titusville, Pennsylvania just a few years earlier (1859).  Within a short time, a 27-year-old man named Thomas Bard was sent west by Scott to manage the California properties.  In the late 1880s, Simí Land and Water Company was formed to see to the selling of the huge rancho in ranch-size properties. Some American farmers had begun to lease land in the greater Rancho Simí for farming.<ref name=":1"/><ref name="Simi Valley Historical Society">{{cite web|title=Strathearn Park, Simi Valley History|url=http://www.simihistory.com/|website=Strathearn Park, Simi Valley History|access-date=May 11, 2017}}</ref>

The earliest Anglo American ranchers showed up in Simí Valley in the late 1860s into the 1870s. Charles Emerson Hoar was given the title of "first American farmer" by early Simí historian Janet Scott Cameron. He had purchased the Hummingbird's Nest Ranch in the northeast corner of the Valley, and he leased land from the new owners of the Simí Rancho for raising sheep, already a proven way of making a living.

Much of the Simí Rancho land continued, as in Spanish days, to be used for raising sheep, cattle and grain. Wheat prospered longer here than in the rest of the county because it was free of a disease called "rust". Barley soon became the really successful grain crop.

Agriculture and ranching dominated the landscape through the 1950s.  Citrus, walnuts and apricots were all grown in Simi Valley.  In the early 1960s modern residential development began to take place.

=== Modern residential development ===
When Simí was an agricultural community, there were ranch houses that dotted the Valley.  Four distinct communities also were located in the Valley (see 'Four Communities of Simi Valley' section below) prior to modern residential development.  Though 1957 and 1958 brought the first 'tract' housing developments when the Dennis and Ayhens, Wright Ranch and Valley Vista tracts were built, the tremendous 'boom' in residential development took place beginning in 1960.  The population which was 4,073 in 1950<ref>1950 Census of Population.  Tabular census data included Moorpark (1,146) as part of Simí Township for a total of 5,219</ref> doubled to 8,110 in 1960.<ref>Note: In 1960 the Census reported a population of Simí Township as 4,417.  This was inclusive of Simí (2,107) and Santa Susana (2,310).  The source for this 1960 population figure is the Ventura County Planning Department (VCPD) data.  The 1960 population number as reported by the VCPD is a little less than double when compared to the Census figure.  This is likely due to the different geographical areas which were included in the count.  Census data included Santa Susana and Simí, while the table below is an example of the areas which the VCPD included – Burro Flats (Knolls), Santa Susana, Simí Urban (town of Simí), Tripas-Tapo (area north of Santa Susana).  It's unclear where Community Center was categorized.  Due to the differential between the Census and the VCPD population numbers, it needs to be considered that, though a good indicator of growth, the population numbers prior to 1960 may be under-representing the population of Simí.</ref> By 1970 the population in Simi is reported by the census as 59,832.

=== Four communities prior to modern residential development ===
The pioneers arrived in the late 1860s – 1870s and ever since, this has been 'The Valley of Simi.'  But, not all the communities in the valley were known as 'Simi.' There was the township of Simi (known as 'Simiopolis' for about a six-month period in 1888). In the valley there were also the communities of Santa Susana, Community Center and the Susana Knolls (known first as Mortimer Park) at different points in time.

'''Simi''' – In late 1887–1888, the incorporation of Simi Land and Water Company came about. El Rancho Simí was divided into ranches and farms by that corporation, and advertised for sale to midwestern and New England states.  An investor group, the California Mutual Benefit Colony of Chicago, purchased land and laid out a townsite (located between First and Fifth Streets and from Los Angeles south to Ventura Ave), named it 'Simiopolis' and shipped twelve pre-cut, partially assembled houses from a lumberyard in Chicago via rail to Saticoy, then brought by wagon to Simi. These are known as 'colony houses.' This was the first 'neighborhood' in Simi. Stores sprung up on Los Angeles Ave, and the first Simi School was built in 1890 on Third and California Streets, and was used until Simi Elementary was built in the mid-1920s.

'''Santa Susana''' – In 1903 the [[Santa Susana Depot#cite note-2|Santa Susana Train Depot]] was built, and the railroad was complete through Simi Valley, except for the tunnel, which was completed in 1904. A small business community grew up near the Santa Susana Train Depot, which was located on the north side of Los Angeles Ave, just east of Tapo Street. Over time residential developments followed and the town of Santa Susana was born. The Depot was moved in 1975 by Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District to its current location off of Kuehner.

'''Community Center''' – In 1922 L.F. Roussey laid out the small development which became known as Community Center. The driving force behind this development was the need for a High School in Simi Valley, as well as an elementary school in a more central location in the valley. The first graduating class from Simi High School was 1924, Simi Elementary was completed in 1926, The Methodist Church (which is now the Cultural Arts Center) was built in 1924. Numerous houses were built in Community Center in the 1920s and 1930s. The Simi Valley Woman's Club was located there as well (the building which served as the clubhouse for the Woman's Club was moved from the town of Simi). The Woman's Club club house was used by many individuals and organizations as a community meeting place.

'''Mortimer Park (the Susana knolls)''' – The area that is now the Knolls was a nearly {{convert|1,800|acre||adj=mid| parcel of land}} that was purchased by Mr. and Mrs. Lewis T. Mortimer in the early 1920s. They planned on selling the lots for cabins, or vacation homes.  The lots were very small (30 x 50 feet), and the Mortimers did not take the mountainous nature of the land into account, so quite often the lots were not buildable. Oftentimes several lots were needed to build structures. In 1944 the Garden Club, an active community organization in the area petitioned the county supervisors to change the name of Mortimer Park to the Susana Knolls.

''The first attempt to incorporate the towns of Simi, the area known as Community Center (93065) and Santa Susana (93063) in 1966 was unsuccessful. The second attempt in 1969 was successful, with residents voting 6,454 to 3,685 in favor of incorporation. 59% of eligible voters turned out for this vote. Susana Knolls is an unincorporated area of the Valley. Voters also voted whether to call this newly incorporated city 'Santa Susana' or 'Simi Valley.' The name Simi Valley garnered 2,000 more votes than Santa Susana.<ref name=":2" />''

The {{convert|2848|acre|ha}} [[Santa Susana Field Laboratory]] located in the [[Simi Hills]], was used for the development of pioneering nuclear reactors and rocket engines beginning in 1948. The site was operated by [[Atomics International]] and [[Rocketdyne]] (originally both divisions of the [[North American Aviation]] company). The Rocketdyne division developed a variety of [[liquid rocket engine]]s. Rocket engine tests were frequently heard in Simi Valley. The Atomics International division of North American Aviation designed, built and operated the [[Sodium Reactor Experiment]], which in 1957 became the first United States commercial [[nuclear reactor]] to supply electricity to a public power system,<ref>{{cite web |title=Sodium Reactor Experiment |url=https://www.etec.energy.gov/Operations/Major_Operations/SRE.php |website=[[United States Department of Energy]] |access-date=June 26, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230428175822/https://www.etec.energy.gov/Operations/Major_Operations/SRE.php |archive-date=April 28, 2023 |language=en |url-status=live}}</ref> when it powered the city of [[Moorpark, California|Moorpark]] (the government owned [[BORAX experiments|BORAX-III]] reactor had previously powered [[Arco, Idaho]] for around an hour in 1955). The last nuclear reactor operated at SSFL in 1980 and the last rocket engine was produced in 2006. The SSFL has been closed to development and testing. The site is undergoing investigation and removal of the nuclear facilities and cleanup of the soil and groundwater.

In July 1959, the [[Sodium Reactor Experiment]] suffered a serious incident when 13 of the reactor's 43 fuel elements partially melted resulting in the controlled release of radioactive gas to the atmosphere. The reactor was repaired and returned to operation in September 1960. The incident at the Sodium Reactor Experiment has been a source of controversy in the community. Technical analysis of the incident intended to support a lawsuit against the current landowner ([[The Boeing Company]]) asserts the incident caused the much greater release of radioactivity than the accident at [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Hirsch | first = Daniel | title = Statement of Dan Hirsch, President, Committee To Bridge The Gap, Before The Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. Senate, Oversight hearing | date = September 18, 2008 | url = http://www.committeetobridgethegap.org/pdf/Hirsch%20EPW%20Testimony.pdf | access-date = September 19, 2011 }}</ref> Boeing's technical response concludes the monitoring conducted at the time of the incident, shows only the allowable amount of radioactive gasses were released, and a Three Mile Island-scale release was not possible.<ref>{{cite book | last = Christian | first = Jerry D | title = Chemical Behavior of Iodine-131 during SRE Fuel Element Damage in July 1959.

====Rodney King trial====

[[File:Simi Valley surroundings.jpg|thumb|Simi Valley Scenic, 2007, with the [[Topatopa Mountains]] in background]]

Four officers of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (Stacey Koon, Laurence Powell, Timothy Wind, and Theodore Briseno) were accused of using unnecessary force in a March 3, 1991, beating of an African-American motorist [[Rodney Glen King]]. The case known as the Rodney King Trials was based on footage recorded on home video by a bystander (George Holliday). The now-infamous video was broadcast nationally and globally and caused tremendous response because the beating was believed to be racially motivated.<ref>Cannon, Lou. (1999).Official Negligence : How Rodney King and the Riots Changed Los Angeles and the LAPD. Basic Books: {{ISBN|0-8133-3725-9}}</ref> Due to the heavy media coverage of the arrest, Judge [[Stanley Weisberg]] of the California Court of Appeals approved a [[change of venue]] to neighboring Ventura County, using an available courtroom in Simi Valley for the state case against the officers.<ref name="LAT 2017-05-07"/>

On April 29, 1992, a Ventura County jury acquitted three of the four officers (Koon, Wind, and Briseno) and did not reach a verdict on one (Powell). Many believed that the unexpected outcome was a result of the racial and social make-up of the jury, which included ten white people, one Filipino person, and one Hispanic woman.<ref name="LAT 2017-05-07">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-abcarian-simi-valley-20170507-story.html|title=An aggravating anniversary for Simi Valley, where a not-guilty verdict sparked the '92 L.A. riots|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Robin |last=Abcarian|date= May 7, 2017|access-date=May 7, 2017}}</ref> None were Simi Valley residents.

Simi Valley is a city located in the very southeast corner of [[Ventura County]], bordering the [[San Fernando Valley]] in [[Los Angeles County]], and is a part of the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]]. The city of Simi Valley basically consists of the [[Simi Valley|eponymous valley]] itself.<ref>Davidson, Harold A. (1970). ''Economic analysis of the growth and development of the Simi Valley''.

Page 101.</ref> It is drained by the [[Calleguas Creek]] and also its principal tributary, [[Conejo Creek]]. Both of these originate in the Santa Susana Mountains.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 42.2 sq mi (109.4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), comprising 41.5 sq mi (107.4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of land and 0.77 sq mi (2.0&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), or 1.81%, of it is water. Simi Valley is located northwest of the Los Angeles neighborhood of [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles|Chatsworth]] and approximately {{convert|30|mi|-1|abbr=on}} from [[Downtown Los Angeles]], {{convert|380|mi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} south of [[San Francisco]], {{convert|160|mi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} north of [[San Diego]], and {{convert|350|mi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} south of [[Sacramento]]. Commutes to Los Angeles are usually via the [[California State Route 118|State Route&nbsp;118]] (Ronald Reagan Freeway) or the Southern California [[Metrolink (California)|Metrolink]] commuter train, which makes several daily trips from Simi Valley. Simi Valley has a [[mediterranean climate]]. Temperate variations between day and night tend to be relatively big. The mean annual temperature is 64.1 degrees ({{convert|64.1|F|C|disp=out}}), while the annual precipitation is {{convert|18.39|in|mm}}. The precipitation remains less than one inch for seven months – April until October, – while the precipitation exceeds four inches in the two wettest months – January and February. While the mean temperature is at its lowest at 53.6 degrees ({{convert|53.6|F|C|disp=out}}) in December, the mean temperature in July and August exceeds 76 degrees ({{convert|76|F|C|disp=out}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idcide.com/weather/ca/simi-valley.htm|title=Simi Valley Weather – Simi Valley CA – Conditions, Forecast, Average|website=idcide.com|access-date=May 11, 2017}}</ref>

Simi Valley has a warm and dry climate during summer when mean temperatures tend to be in the 70s. Wildfires do also occur here. The city's climate cools during winter when mean temperatures tend to be in the 50s. Because of its relatively low elevation, the [[Simi Hills]] typically experience rainy, mild winters. Snow is rare in the Simi Hills, even in the highest areas. The warmest month of the year is August with an average maximum temperature of {{convert|96|F}}, while the coldest month of the year is December with an average minimum temperature of {{convert|38|F}}. Temperature variations between night and day tend to be relatively large during summer, with a difference that can reach {{convert|38|F-change}}, and moderate during winter with an average difference of {{convert|29|F-change}}. The annual average precipitation in Simi Valley is 17.9 inches. Winter months tend to be wetter than summer months. The wettest month of the year is February with an average rainfall of 4.8 inches. Simi Valley gets 18 inches of rain per year, while the United States average is 37. Snowfall is 0 inches, while the U.S. average is 25 inches of snow per year. The number of days with measurable precipitation is 25. On average, there are 277 sunny days in Simi Valley per year. The July high is approximately {{convert|96|F}}. The January low is {{convert|39|F}}.<ref>U.S. Department of Agriculture (C. Robert Elford). 1970. ''Soil Survey: Ventura Area, California''. Oakland, CA: University of California Press.

===Natural hazards===

[[File:Simi Valley fire California USA.jpg|thumb|right|Wildfire in the [[Simi Hills]], 2003. U.S. Air Force [[C-130 Hercules]] pilots flew eight [[C-130]] cargo airplanes and dropped 129,600 gallons of retardant on the fire.]]

An aspect of Simi Valley's location, situated beside the [[Simi Hills]], is that it lies in a high-risk area for the wildfires that sweep through Southern California's mountain ranges every few years. Simi Valley is also at risk for earthquakes. The valley is surrounded by [[Fault (geology)|fault]]s; the closest ones being the Santa Rosa Fault to the Northwest, the Northridge Hills Fault to the Northeast, and the Chatsworth Fault to the South. In 1994, portions of Simi Valley received significant damage from the [[1994 Northridge earthquake|Northridge earthquake]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/events/1994_01_17.php |title=Historic Earthquakes |access-date=November 30, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201081744/https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/events/1994_01_17.php |archive-date=December 1, 2016  }}</ref> 

====Wildfires====

In autumn 2003, the [[Simi Fire]] burned about 108,000 acres.  A 2005 fire started on September 28 and burned an estimated {{convert|7000|acre|km2|-1|abbr=on}}. On September 29, the fire was estimated to be {{convert|17000|acre|km2|-1|abbr=on}}. More than 1,000 firefighters worked against the tricky combination of dry brush, low humidity and temperatures in the high 90s along the line that divides Los Angeles and Ventura counties. The fire was later brought under control and extinguished, without serious injury. Three homes were lost in outlying areas, but none within the city limits.

Before the 1960s, Simi Valley once boasted a strong community of Latino families, many of whom worked for white ranchers. However, the housing boom in the 1960s and 1970s attracted many white Americans leaving urban areas in [[Los Angeles]] and the [[San Fernando Valley]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Reed |first1=Mack |title=Negative Image Created by Trial Haunts Simi Valley |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-04-28-mn-53333-story.html |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 28, 1997}}</ref> This turned Simi Valley into a predominately white city, but the percentage of those who identified as non-Hispanic white began to decrease from 86.2% in 1980 to 54% in 2020.
