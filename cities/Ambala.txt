According to another version, it is named after the goddess "Bhawani Amba," whose Temple still exists in Ambala city.<ref name=hargazc1>[http://revenueharyana.gov.in/Portals/0/hr-gaz-ch-5.pdf Haryana Gazateer], Revenue Dept of Haryana, Capter-V.</ref><ref name="google">{{cite book|title=Tourism Management|author1=Bajwa, J.S.|author2=Kaur, R.|year=2007|publisher=APH Publishing Corporation|isbn=9788131300473|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TVXCiwdwPxsC}}</ref>  The English spelling Umballa has sometimes been used; this spelling was used by [[Rudyard Kipling]] in his 1901 novel ''[[Kim (novel)|Kim]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bibliomania.com/0/0/31/66/frameset.html |title=Bibliomania: Free Online Literature and Study Guides |access-date=2 December 2023}}</ref>

===Classical era===
Archaeological Surveyor C.J Rodgers found [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom]] coins as well as coins of [[Huna people|Hunas]], [[Mihirakula]] and [[Toramana]] which indicated that after the disintegration of the [[Mauryan empire]], the area was taken over by [[Indo-Parthians]] and later incorporated into the domain of the Hunas.<ref name=hargazc1/>

===Late medieval era===
In 1709, Battle of Ambala was fought, and [[Sikhs]] captured Ambala from [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Sagoo|first=Harbans|title=Banda Singh Bahadur and Sikh Sovereignty|year=2001|publisher=Deep & Deep Publications|url=https://archive.org/stream/BandaSinghBahadurAndSikhSovereignty/BandaSinghBahadurAndSikhSovereignty_djvu.txt}}</ref> It was under the rule of [[Gill (name)|Gill]] [[Jats]] from 1748 to 1825.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Siṅgha |first1=Bhagata |title=A History of the Sikh Misals |date=1993 |publisher=Publication Bureau, Punjabi University |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BihuAAAAMAAJ |access-date=30 May 2023}}</ref> It was also the capital of [[Nishanwalia Misl]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Singh |first1=Khazan |title=History of the Sikh Religion |date=1970 |publisher=Department of Languages, Punjab |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ImAgAAAAMAAJ |access-date=30 May 2023}}</ref> For some time it had been under the rule of Jawahir Singh of [[Mustafabad, Haryana|Mustafabad]], a descendant of Desu Singh Randhawa.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sharma |first1=Suresh K. |title=Haryana: Past and Present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6n7vV0eiS3YC&q=jawahir+singh+ambala+mustafabad |access-date=30 May 2023 |publisher=Mittal Publications |date=1 February 2006 |isbn=9788183240468 |language=en}}</ref>

[[Ambala Cantonment|Ambala Army Cantonment]] was established in 1843 after the British were forced to leave its [[Karnal]] Cantonment following the malaria epidemic of 1841–42 in as there were not any known effective means to control malaria epidemic in those days. The cantonment houses the '2 Corps', one of the three Strike Corps of the [[Indian Army]].

=====Ambala Air Force Base=====
[[Ambala Air Force Base]] is one of the oldest and largest airbases that were inherited from the British by the [[Indian Air Force|IAF]]. It was from this airbase that [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] and [[T-6 Texan|Harvards]] flown by Instructors of the Advanced Flying Training School took part in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948]]. Subsequently, Ambala was the front line airfield for many years. It was home to various aircraft that were inducted into the [[Indian Air Force]]. [[de Havilland Vampire|Vampires]], [[Dassault Ouragan|Ouragans]], [[Hawker Hunter|Hunters]], etc. all flew from this base. The airbase was briefly attacked in 1965 by [[B-57 Canberra|B-57 bombers]] of the [[Pakistan Air Force]]. Today, the Airbase houses the '7 Wing' with squadrons of [[SEPECAT Jaguar|Jaguars]] and [[MiG-21]] Bisons. A unit of the French-made [[Dassault Rafale]] will also be based at Ambala airbase.<ref>{{cite news |last1=ANI |title=Indian Air Force To Deploy Rafale Jets in Ambala, Hashimara |url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-air-force-to-deploy-rafale-jets-in-ambala-hashimara-1972607 |access-date=10 March 2019 |work=[[NDTV]] |date=4 January 2019}}</ref>

In its 160 years of existence as a district, Ambala has witnessed many changes in its boundaries. Previously, it extended across [[tehsils]] of Ambala, [[Chandigarh]], [[Jagadhri]], Pipli, Kharar, [[Ropar]] and [[Nalagarh]]. Kalka-cum-Kurari State, [[Pinjore]], [[Mani Majra]], [[Kasauli]] & [[Sanawar]] were also merged later into the district at different times.
