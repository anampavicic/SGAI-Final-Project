'''La Romana''' is a municipality and capital of the southeastern [[La Romana Province|province of La Romana]], opposite [[Catalina Island, Dominican Republic|Catalina Island]]. It is one of the 10 largest cities in the [[Dominican Republic]] with a population estimated in 2022 at 153,241 within the city limits ([[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] population: 270,000), of whom 149,840 are urban and 3,401 are rural.  The name ''Romana'' comes from the word "Bomana", a name given by Indians to what is known today as Romana River.

The modern [[La Romana International Airport]] was opened in 2000. The city is near several other cities, such as [[San Pedro de Macorís]] and the national capital, [[Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo de Guzmán]]. The city is a hub for a growing tourist industry with several nearby local resort spots, such as the beachfront [[Bayahibe]], Dominicus, Casa de Campo, and the growing number of golf resorts that surround the area.

==History==
The city of La Romana was officially founded in 1897 as an oil town. After 1917 with the construction of a large sugar-mill the economy quickly shifted to sugar production. The commissioning of the sugar mill coincided with the rise in sugar prices worldwide, prompting the [[sugar industry]] to welcome workers from different parts of the country as well as other parts of the [[cocolo|Caribbean]], many families moved to La Romana for economic opportunities.

In early 1960, [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf and Western Industries, Inc.]] purchased the sugar mill and started to invest in the [[livestock industry]] which was cemented in the province. Meanwhile, $20 million were invested to rebuild La Romana and build schools, clinics, housing and other infrastructure for workers. During the mid-1970s the American conglomerate began selling its Dominican assets, and at the same time built what is now one of the largest exclusive [[tourist resort]]s in the Dominican Republic, [[Casa de Campo, Dominican Republic|Casa de Campo]].

==Economy==
La Romana has historically been a [[company town]], with the [[Central Romana Corporation]] owning the majority of the town. It is a town with nearly 100% employment, mostly in the tourism industry or with The Central Romana Corporation, the Duty Free Zone ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080905142109/http://www.zfr.com.do/ Zona Franca Romana]), or one of the service businesses there.

La Romana has been a one-company town since the South Puerto Rico Sugar Company built the mammoth Central Romana mill in 1917. It was the only sugar operation not taken over by [[Rafael Trujillo]] during his reign. From 1964 to 1967, the South Puerto Rico Sugar Company, including properties in Florida, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic became part of the conglomerate [[Gulf+Western]]. In 1984, the Gulf+Western Corporation sold their stake in the Central Romana Corporation to a group of local and foreign investors which includes the [[Fanjul brothers]].

Gulf+Western acquired Consolidated Cigar in 1968 and shifted the Canary Island cigar-making operation to its Tabacalera de Garcia tobacco plant in La Romana. The Tabacalera de Garcia factory is currently one of the largest cigar factories in the world, and has been owned by the biggest cigar marketing company in the world, [[Altadis]], since 1999. Three world-famous brands are produced in La Romana: [[Montecristo (cigar)|Montecristo]], [[H. Upmann]], and [[Romeo y Julieta (cigar)|Romeo y Julieta]].

== Tourism ==
[[File:Amphitheater in Altos de Chavón, La Romana, Dominican Republic.jpg|thumb|right|Altos de Chavón Amphitheater.]]

[[Casa de Campo, Dominican Republic|Casa de Campo]] resort complex is the flagship of the La Romana All Inclusive Resorts area. Built in 1975 by Gulf+Western to be the premiere destination in the Caribbean, it has lived up to the hype. In 1984 Casa de Campo was purchased by the Central Romana Corporation which is co-owned by the [[Fanjul brothers]].

[[Altos de Chavón]] is a reconstruction of a 16th-century Mediterranean village located just minutes from La Romana.

[[Central Romana Port|Casa de Campo International Tourist Port (Muelle Turístico Internacional Casa de Campo)]], located on the West Bank of La Romana River or ''Rio Dulce'', has  been utilized primarily for the docking of commercial ships, primarily for the transport of sugar and molasses. Upon exceeding the capacity of its port, the Central Romana Corporation built its new tourism focused port on the east side of the river. The platform on the western bank was renovated and the river channel was dredged to a depth of {{convert|10.50|m|ft}}.

Inaugurated with the arrival of the vessel ''[[Costa Marina]]'' in December 2002, the Central Romana Corporation invested US$12 million to extend the existing port by over {{convert|40000|m2|sqft}}. The port is a modern platform and harbor terminal, with a capacity for two large modern cruise ships. Today the new facilities boast two docking platforms (East Dock: {{convert|255|m|ft}} in length, West Dock: {{convert|225|m|ft}} in length), a {{convert|1000|m2|sqft}} passenger terminal and parking facilities which accommodate 24 buses.

[[La Romana International Airport]] (IATA: LRM, ICAO: MDLR) is a private commercial airport in the east of the Dominican Republic, serving the resort town of La Romana and the resort of Casa de Campo. It was built in a traditional Dominican style, with open-air terminals.
[[File:Dominikanische Republik, La Romana International Airport - Dominican Republic - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|La Romana airport.]]
There is a significant number of charter lines and flights to La Romana; this airport registered a large influx of visitors in 2002, making it one of the most visited airports in the Dominican Republic.

It currently ranks fifth in air traffic, behind Punta Cana, Las Américas, Puerto Plata and Santiago. The airport receives many international airlines. The airport has 7 positions in the international terminal and a spacious private aviation terminal where up to 12 private jets can be parked.

==Climate==
La Romana has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Aw'') only slightly above a [[semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid climate]] (''BSh'') due to its shielded location from the northeasterly [[trade winds]].
