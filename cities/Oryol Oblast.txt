==History==
[[File:Наряды Орловской губернии.jpg|200px|thumb|Outfits of the Oryol province, 1908]]
In the 12th century, chronicles mention [[Mtsensk]], known as Novosil then. Then modern Orlovschina was part of the [[Chernigov Principality]]. After the death of [[Mikhail of Chernigov]] Novosil Principality was formed on these territories. By the end of the 15th century it had disintegrated into four separate principalities and, along with all the other fragments of the Chernigov principality, became a part of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. In the 16th century, the fortress town of Oryol was founded, and the town of [[Livny]], destroyed in the 13th century, was restored. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the territory of modern Oryol was the [[Borders of Russia|borderland]] of the [[Tsardom of Russia]], with many fortifications of the [[Great Zasechnaya cherta|Great Abatis Line]] . With the reduction of the threat posed by the [[Tatars]], agricultural activity of the area had intensified.
It was created in 1937 by uniting a selection of territories of three other oblasts: [[Kursk Oblast]], [[Western Oblast]], and [[Voronezh Oblast]]. It also included present [[Bryansk Oblast]] between 1937 and 1944.
In 1941-3 The Region was partly or fully occupied by Germany.

==Politics==
[[File:The building of the House of Soviets IMG 2586.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[:ru:Дом Советов (Орёл)|House of Soviets]] in Oryol on Lenin Square is the building of the Council of People's Deputies and the government of the Oryol Oblast]]
During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Oryol CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of Oryol Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The [[Oryol Oblast Council of People's Deputies]] is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the [[Governor of Oryol Oblast]], who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].

The head of administration of Oryol Oblast between 1993 and 2009 was [[Yegor Stroyev]]. Stroyev led the region for more than 20 years. In 1985 he became the first secretary of the regional committee of the [[CPSU]], and after three years (in 1989-1991 he worked as secretary of the [[Central Committee of the CPSU]]), in 1991 he returned to Oryol, worked as the director of the Institute of Horticultural Crops Selection, and later was elected governor. On February 16, 2009 Russian President Dmitry Medvedev accepted Stroyev's voluntary retirement and nominated [[Alexander Petrovich Kozlov|Alexander Kozlov]] as his replacement, which was approved by the Oryol Regional Council of People's Deputies.

===Legislature===
The [[Oryol Oblast Council of People's Deputies]] is a permanent representative and legislative body of state power in the Oryol Oblast. It consists of 50 deputies elected by residents of the region for 5 year terms according to a [[mixed-member proportional representation]]: 25 deputies according to party lists ([[proportional representation]]) and 25 in single-mandate constituencies ([[majoritarian representation]]) on the basis of universal equal and direct suffrage by secret ballot.

The current 7th Council of People's Deputies was elected in the [[2021 Russian regional elections]] and will last until 2026. Of the 50 deputies, 27 are from [[United Russia]], 11 from the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]], 6 from [[A Just Russia – For Truth]], 3 from the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]], 1 from [[New People (political party)|New People]], 1 from the [[Russian Party of Pensioners for Social Justice]], and 1 independent. [[:ru:Музалевский, Леонид Семёнович|Leonid Muzalevsky]] (United Russia) was elected Chairman of the Council.
