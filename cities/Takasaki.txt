==Geography==
Takasaki is located in the southwestern part of [[Gunma Prefecture]] in the flat northwestern part of the [[Kantō Plain]]. The city is located approximately 90 to 100 kilometers from central Tokyo . [[Mount Akagi]], [[Mount Haruna]] and [[Mount Myogi]] can be seen from the city, and the southern slopes of Mount Haruna are within the city limits.

==History==
During the [[Edo period]], the area of present-day Takasaki was the center of the [[Takasaki Domain]], a [[han system|feudal domain]] held by a branch of the [[Matsudaira clan]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in [[Kōzuke Province]]. The area also prospered from its location on the [[Nakasendō]] highway connecting [[Edo]] with [[Kyoto]]. [[Shukuba|Post stations]] located within the borders of modern Takasaki were: [[Shinmachi-shuku]], [[Kuragano-shuku]], and [[Takasaki-shuku]].
Following the [[Meiji Restoration]], Takasaki was briefly capital of Gunma Prefecture, before the capital was moved to Maebashi in 1881.

Takasaki Town was created within [[Gunma District, Gunma]] on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. It was raised to city status on April 1, 1900. On April 1, 1927, Takasaki annexed the neighboring villages of Tsukasawa and Kataoka, followed by Sano on October 1, 1937. The city largely escaped damage in World War II. Following the war, it continued to expand its borders by annexing the village of Rokugo on April 1, 1951, Shintakao and Nakamura as well as Yawata and Toyooka from [[Usui District, Gunma|Ushi District]] on January 20, 1955. This was followed by Orui village and Sano village from Tano District on September 30, 1956. The city celebrated its 360th anniversary in 1963 and annexed the town of Kuragano on March 31 of the same year. On September 1, 1965 the village of Gunnan was annexed.

In September 1987, five-year-old Yoshiaki Ogiwara, the son of a local firefighter, was abducted and subsequently murdered in Takasaki. The murder received heavy media coverage across Japan.<ref>Kristof, Nicholas D. "[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/20/world/kidnap-murder-of-5-year-old-shakes-japan.html Kidnap-murder of 5-year-old shakes Japan"], ''The New York Times'', 20 September 1987. Retrieved 12 April 2015.</ref>

On April 1, 2001 Takasaki was proclaimed a [[Special cities of Japan|Special City (Tokurei-shi)]], which gave it greater autonomy.

On January 23, 2006, the towns of [[Gunma, Gunma|Gunma]], [[Kurabuchi, Gunma|Kurabuchi]] and [[Misato, Gunma|Misato]] (all from [[Gunma District, Gunma|Gunma District]]), and the town of [[Shinmachi, Gunma|Shinmachi]] (from [[Tano District, Gunma|Tano District]]) were merged into Takasaki. On October 1, 2006, the town of [[Haruna, Gunma|Haruna]] (from [[Gunma District, Gunma|Gunma District]]) was merged into the expanded city of Takasaki. Gunma District was dissolved as a result of this merger. On June 1, 2009, the town of [[Yoshii, Gunma|Yoshii]] (from [[Tano District, Gunma|Tano District]]) was merged into expanded city of Takasaki.<ref name="Plannedmerge">[http://www.kokudo.or.jp/new/cities/sub/kanto/10.htm Information at kokudo.or.jp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821060502/http://www.kokudo.or.jp/new/cities/sub/kanto/10.htm |date=August 21, 2006}}</ref>

Takasaki was elevated to a [[Core cities of Japan|Core city]] with even greater autonomy on April 1, 2011.

==Government==
Takasaki has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 38 members. Takasaki contributes nine members to the Gunma Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between the [[Gunma 4th district]] and  [[Gunma 5th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Primary and secondary education==
Takasaki has over sixty public elementary schools and 25 public middle schools operated by the city government and eight public high schools operated by the Gunma Prefecture Board of Education. In addition, the city operates one public high school and there are five private high schools. The prefecture also operates five special education schools for the handicapped.
=== English education ===
Takasaki developed its own unique English curriculum and implemented it at all of the primary and middle schools in the city.<ref name="TakaNews1">{{cite news |title=４月から小学校全校で英語教育 |url=http://www.takasakiweb.jp/news_cat/news/1243/ |access-date=1 June 2022 |publisher=高崎新聞 |date=25 December 2015 |language=ja}}</ref> Primary school students in 1st through 4th grades have English lessons (formally called 'foreign language activities') once a week, while 5th and 6th grades have proper English lessons twice a week. This totals 35 hours (only 34 for 1st grade) of English education for 1st through 4th graders and 70 hours for 5th and 6h graders.<ref name="TakaNews1" /> 

The main emphasis on primary school English in Takasaki is communication; students are actively encouraged to listen to authentic English and express themselves to their peers. In order to achieve this, Mayor Tomioka pushed to increase the number of Assistant Language Teachers in the city.<ref name="TakaNews1" /><ref>{{cite web |title=令和２年度高崎市総合教育会議 会議録 |url=https://www.city.takasaki.gunma.jp/docs/2016052300034/files/2sougoukyouiku.pdf |website=高崎市の公式HP |access-date=1 June 2022}}</ref> Commonly referred to as ALTs, they are native English speakers hired from abroad to come and assist Japanese teachers during English class. Takasaki employs many ALTs through [[JET Programme|The JET Program]].<ref>{{cite web |title=小学校における英語教育と高崎市の取組 |url=http://www.clair.or.jp/j/forum/forum/pdf_325/09_jetprogram.pdf |website=自治体国際化フォーラム｜ |publisher=自治体国際化 (CLAIR) |access-date=1 June 2022}}</ref> Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Takasaki had at least 1 ALT assigned to every primary and middle school in the city. The Takasaki Board of Education claims that Takasaki was the first in all of Japan to have English lessons starting in 1st grade, to have English twice a week for older students, and to assign at least 1 ALT to every school.<ref name="koho1">{{cite web |title=広報高崎 |url=https://www.city.takasaki.gunma.jp/docs/2019101000039/files/11015-2.pdf |website=高崎市の公式HP |access-date=1 June 2022}}</ref> 

In 2014, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (also abbreviated as MEXT) acknowledged the need to increase students' English ability in order to succeed globally.<ref name="Nikkyo1">{{cite news |title=英語教育改革が2020年度からスタート、小中高校で英語の授業はどう変わる？ |url=https://www.kyoiku-press.com/post-204251/ |access-date=1 June 2022 |publisher=日本教育新聞電子版　NIKKYOWEB |date=26 June 2019 |language=ja}}</ref> In 2016, MEXT then designated Takasaki as a pilot city to test out upcoming changes to the nationwide English curriculum; the changes were modeled after the existing Takasaki curriculum. It was decided that the changes would officially begin in stages; primary schools would adapt the new curriculum nationwide in 2020, middle schools in 2021, and secondary schools in 2022.<ref>{{cite web |title=新学習指導要領 |url=https://www.komei.or.jp/km/komei/files/2019/05/3764e102f98326654898bbe9e62af02a.pdf |website=公明党の公式HP |access-date=1 June 2022}}</ref><ref name="Nikkyo1" /> 

In 2019, MEXT did a survey to see how both primary and middle school students were performing in all subjects at the prefectural level.
