San Pedro Garza Garcia was founded in 1596. The land was converted into a large [[plantation]] called "Los Nogales" which produced crops like corn, wheat, and beans.

During the 18th century, the [[plantation]] often went by the name of "San Pedro", in honor of [[Saint Peter]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}}

The city was elevated to the status of "Villa" (town) on December 14, 1882, when it was given the name Garza García, in honor of the [[governor of Nuevo León]], [[Genaro Garza García]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}}

In 1988, the mayor at the time, [[Alejandro Chapa Salazar]], gave the city its current name, adding the reference to what it was called centuries before.{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}}
