'''Nasugbu''', officially the '''Municipality of Nasugbu''' ({{lang-tgl|Bayan ng Nasugbu}}),  is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Batangas]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 136,524 people.{{PH census|current}}

Several bus services provide transportation to and from Nasugbu. [[Jeepney]]s from [[Tagaytay]] also enter and leave the town at a scheduled time. Within the town, tricycles are the main mode of transport.

==Geography==
According to the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]], the municipality has a land area of {{convert|278.51|km2|sp=us}}{{PSGC detail|area}} constituting {{percentage|278.51|3,119.75|2|pad=yes}} of the {{convert|3,119.75|km2|2|adj=mid|sp=us}} total area of Batangas. It is {{convert|77|km}} from [[Batangas City]], {{convert|95|km}} from [[Manila]], and {{convert|85|km}} from [[Imus]].

===Topography===
[[File:Pantalan 4.JPG|thumb|left|Nasugbu is characterized by rolling [[hills]], wide [[plain]]s, and farmlands.]]

Nasugbu is bounded on the north by the municipalities of [[Maragondon, Cavite|Maragondon]], [[Magallanes, Cavite|Magallanes]] and [[Alfonso, Cavite|Alfonso]] in the province of [[Cavite]]; on the east by the Batangas municipalities of [[Laurel, Batangas|Laurel]], [[Calaca, Batangas|Calaca]], and [[Balayan, Batangas|Balayan]]; on the south by the Batangas municipalities of [[Lian, Batangas|Lian]] and [[Tuy, Batangas|Tuy]]; and on the west by the [[South China Sea]].

Entering the town proper via the national highway, one passes fields of sugar cane, corn, and rice fields; hills and mountains. The terrain slopes downwards to the South China Sea. Because of its rolling terrain and coastline location, agriculture (sugarcane, rice, corn, vegetables, coconut, fruits), and aquaculture are Nasugbu's main industries.

[[File:Nasugbu Town.jpg|thumb|Town center ]]
In the 2020 census, Nasugbu had a population of 136,524.{{PH census|current}} The population density was {{convert|{{sigfig|136,524/278.51|2}}|PD/km2|sp=us}}.

Most of the people in Nasugbu are [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]]s. In recent years, there's been a noticeable increase of [[Visayan people|Visayans]] in Barangay Wawa and other [[barangay]]s. The main language spoken is [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], and a significant number{{vague|date=December 2016}} now speaks [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] and [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]]. Due to the historic relevance of the town, a small number of families speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Many among the educated class speak [[English language|English]].

A great majority of Nasugbugueños are [[Catholic]]s. Although there is a legislated separation of church and state in the Philippines, the town fiesta on December 3 is a holiday. Nasugbu is also one of the most important centres of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the [[Archdiocese of Lipa]]. Though officially called Vicariate I, it is sometimes called the [[Vicariate]] of [[Francis Xavier|San Francisco Xavier]] in honour of the town's patron saint. Some barangays have their own respective patron saints and celebrate a feast day other than that of Saint Francis Xavier's.

With the growing number of Catholic faithfuls in the town, it has been proposed that Saint Francis Xavier Parish would be divided into two. The proposed new parish is to be called the Parish of San Antonio de Padua and would have its parochial church at barangay Kaylaway. As of today, San Antonio de Padua functions as parish with its own council and ministries.

The minority belong to other minor religions like the indigenous [[Iglesia ni Cristo]]; [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons); [[Evangelical Christianity]]; and the [[United Church of Christ in the Philippines|UCCP]].

In Presidential Decree 1520, president [[Ferdinand Marcos]] declared some areas of the municipality as a potential tourism area. Since then, Nasugbu has had a tourism industry focused primarily on its beaches. Its proximity to [[Manila]] makes it a popular choice.

Some economic highlights are the development of Nasugbu's agro-industrial industry (feed mills, meat processing, and poultry-growing) by building more farm-to-market roads. Hiking in the mountains and virgin forests around Nasugbu is popular. One particular spot, Karakawa, is a series of multi-tiered naturally formed rock pools hewn out of the mountain. The smallest pool is about the size of a Jacuzzi, while the biggest measures about {{convert|25|sqm|sp=us}}. The pools are more than {{convert|6|m|sp=us}} deep, and one can catch fish in the pools.

===Agriculture===
At the moment, because of its rolling terrain and coastline location, agriculture (sugarcane, rice, corn, vegetables, coconut, fruits), and aquaculture are Nasugbu's main industries. It was home to the [[Central Azucarera Don Pedro]], one of the country's largest sugar producers. [[First Pacific|Roxas Holdings Incorporated]] on March 29, 2024 permanently closed its wholly owned subsidiary, the 97-year-old Central Azucarera Don Pedro in Nasugbu where [[Manny Pangilinan]] is vice-chairman. Founded in 1927, CADPI's "serious business losses" resulted in the termination of all its employees. In 2023, it shut down its milling operations and sold its [[sugarcane mill]] in Nasugbu, Batangas to [[Universal Robina Corporation]], which operates a sugar mill in nearby [[Balayan, Batangas]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=De Castro |first1= Isagani|title=A 97-year-old Philippine company closes down|url=https://www.rappler.com/business/sugar-refining-company-central-azucarera-don-pedro-incorporated-closes-down/|accessdate=March 2, 2024 |publisher= [[Rappler]]|date=March 1, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Arcalas |first1=Jasper |title=Batangas sugar refinery stops operations|url= https://www.philstar.com/business/2024/03/01/2337118/batangas-sugar-refinery-stops-operations |accessdate=March 2, 2024 |publisher=[[The Philippine Star]] |date=March 1, 2024}}</ref>

Being home to one of the largest sugar milling companies of the country, the production of sweets is a significant portion of the local economy. Nasugbu is the only town in Luzon which hosts a ''bibingkahan'' (rice cake area) in its public market.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} There are at least 10 kinds of rice cakes that are found only in Nasugbu, in addition to the varieties that could be found elsewhere in the country. Many Nasugbugueños, even those who do not do much cooking, take pride in making a variety of sweets such as sweetened yam, sweetened coconut, and similar products.

===Tourism===
[[File:NasugbuPlazaBatangasjf0045 13.JPG|thumb|Plaza de Roxas]]

Nasugbu has built a reputation as a [[resort town]] known for its beaches.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rocamora |first1=Joyce Ann |title=Pico de Loro: Sustainable, meaningful travel experience |url=https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1207766 |access-date=3 April 2024 |agency=Philippine News Agency |date=14 August 2023}}</ref><ref name="booming">{{cite news |title=All eyes on booming Nasugbu |url=https://www.philstar.com/business/2019/10/08/1958354/all-eyes-booming-nasugbu |access-date=3 April 2024 |work=The Philippine Star |date=8 October 2019}}</ref>

On August 3, 2007, by ''Executive Order 647'', President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] declared Nasugbu, known for its white sand beach resorts, a special tourism zone, mandating the formation of a private sector-led "Nasugbu eminent persons group" to oversee development. The Nasugbu Special Tourism Zone will cover areas included in the Nasugbu Tourism Development Plan prepared by the [[municipal government]] and validated by the [[Philippine Tourism Authority]] (PTA). SM Investments Corp. (SMIC) built a {{convert|59|km2|abbr=on}} [[resort]], the Hamilo Coast, at the NSTZ.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|url=http://business.inquirer.net/money/breakingnews/view_article.php?article_id=86184 |title=Business - Arroyo declares Nasugbu a special tourism zone - INQUIRER.net |access-date=September 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904091114/http://business.inquirer.net/money/breakingnews/view_article.php?article_id=86184 |archive-date=September 4, 2007 }}</ref> Also included in the tourism zone are [[Punta Fuego]] and [[Mounts Palay-Palay–Mataas-na-Gulod Protected Landscape]] where [[Mount Pico de Loro]] is located.<ref name="booming"/>

==Cultural and historical significance==
[[File:NasugbuChurchjf0135 15.JPG|thumb|The [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] façade of St. Francis Xavier Parish Church along J. P. Laurel Street.]]
[[File:Nasugbu 32 (Nasugbu Patron Saints).JPG|thumb|[[St. Francis Xavier]] and [[St. Lorenzo Ruiz]], the two patrons of the Town.]]
There are no historical documents recounting Nasugbu's foundation. The earliest written records of the place are of the founding by the [[Jesuits]] of the Parish of [[St. Francis Xavier]] in 1852.

Nasugbu did not become an important commercial center due to the proximity of [[Balayan, Batangas|Balayan]].

The first historical account of this town relates to when a native tribesman, known only as Matienza, led his fellow Nasugbugueños, together with some natives from the nearby [[Lian, Batangas|Lian]], in revolt against a large land grant to the Roxases. This revolt failed. This happened in the latter part of the 19th century.

Nasugbu was not as much irrigated as the fields of nearby towns, making it one of the towns that suffered much when the town of Lipa was besieged on June 18, 1896. Ten days later the effects for the people of Nasugbu were so dire that the Gobernadorcillo authorised taking 1,000 pesos from the treasury of Lipa to provide a rice subsidy for the Nasugbugueños.

When the [[Philippine Revolution|revolution]] officially started in Batangas in September 1896, an organised revolt also broke out in the town of Nasugbu, together with the towns of Balayan, Lian, [[Talisay, Batangas|Talisay]], and [[Lemery, Batangas|Lemery]] seven weeks later. The ''Revolt of Nasugbu'' was led by Luciano San Miguel and was one of the largest revolts in the province. However, on December 12, 1896, San Miguel unknowingly led his men into a trap, and Nasugbu suffered the greatest number of casualties in the revolution.

In September 1898, the town of Cauit ([[Kawit]]) in [[Cavite]] declared independence from Spanish rule. This made the life of the Caviteños more tumultuous than before. Due to this, the people of the nearby town of [[Alfonso, Cavite|Alfonso]] invaded the Roxas estate and started to harass the tenants there. Although the municipal officials of Nasugbu responded quickly and complained to their counterparts in Cavite, the citizens were already defying authority.

On March 28, 1903, the adjacent municipality of Lian was merged with Nasugbu.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=708|date=March 28, 1903|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%20708|title=An Act Reducing Thirteen of the Municipalities in the Province of Batangas to Five|accessdate=July 7, 2023}}</ref> It later separated from Nasugbu effective January 1, 1915 by virtue of Executive Order No. 127 signed by [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Francis Burton Harrison]] four days prior, restoring its independent municipality status.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=EO|number=127|date=December 28, 1914|url=https://www.batangashistory.date/2019/01/executive-order127.html|title=An Act Reducing Thirteen of the Municipalities in the Province of Batangas to Five|accessdate=July 7, 2023|website=Batangas History, Culture and Folklore}}</ref>

During times of war, Batangas was administered by the Governor General and the right of [[habeas corpus]] was suspended, resulting in more casualties.

=== Archeological significance ===

==== The Nasugbu Cow ====
The Dark Age of Nasugbu was compensated by a great archaeological discovery. According to the [[National Museum of the Philippines]], a group of scientists found a wooden cow a year before the [[Second World War]]. Knowing that it was of great significance to the history of the country, the cow was immediately handed over the National Museum, but it did not survive the destruction of the war. However, a year after the war, a new archaeological artifact was excavated in the nearby town of [[Calatagan]], which in turn became the most important prehistoric artifact of the country.

==Government==
===Local government===
{{main|Sangguniang Bayan}}
[[File:NasugbuHalljf9999 25.JPG|thumb|Municipal hall]]
In the May 2019 elections, Antonio "Tony" Barcelon won the mayoralty seat. Just like other municipalities, the local government is headed by the mayor, with the vice mayor serving as the deputy and the presiding officer of the eight-seat Nasugbu Municipal Council.

==Education==
Nasugbu West Central School is the largest [[elementary school]] in the [[Southern Tagalog]] region. Other elementary schools in the town proper include Lourderette School, Pedagogia, Saint Paul's, RB Cordero Academy and Creative Dreams School. Most barangays have their own grade schools, and some in recent years also have high schools, as in Bilaran and Kaylaway.

Nasugbu Institute, founded in 1932, is a private high school. Nasugbu also hosts the high school campus of the [[Batangas State University]], known locally as the [[Apolinario R. Apacible School of Fisheries]] (or simply "Fisheries"). It was formerly a fishery school with courses including Fish Culture, Fish Capture, and Fish Preservation, but was later attached to the Batangas State University. Presently, aside from Fishery courses, the school also offers other courses like Nutrition and Dietetics, Nursing, Education, and Tourism. Other relatively new high schools are Nasugbu Christian Faith Academy, Adelaido A. Bayot Memorial School, and the RB Cordero Academy. Other schools in Nasugbu include Nasugbu East Central School, Nasugbu West Central School, Nicolites Montessori School, Pantalan Elementary School, and Bilaran Elementary School and many others.

The town is home to the Nasugbu Auditorium, where many cultural activities regularly are held. It is the town's primary theatre and showcases not only plays but also concerts of popular artists and bands.
