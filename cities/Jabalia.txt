'''Jabalia''', also spelled '''Jabalya''' ({{langx|ar|جباليا}}), is a city in the [[State of Palestine]] located {{convert|4|km|mi|sp=us}} north of [[Gaza City]], in the [[North Gaza Governorate]] of the [[Gaza Strip]]. According to the [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]], Jabalia had a population of 172,704 in 2017.<ref name="PrelimCensus2017" /> The [[Jabalia refugee camp]] is adjacent to the city to the north. The nearby town of [[Nazla]] is a part of the Jabalia municipality.

==Archaeology==
A large [[cemetery]] dating to the 8th century CE was found near Jabalia. The workmanship indicates that the Christian community in [[Gaza City|Gaza]] was still very much in existence in the early [[Islam]]ic era of rule in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and capable of artistic achievements. The remains of the pavement spared by the [[Iconoclasm|iconoclast]]s show depictions of wild game, birds, and country scenes. The late dating of the mosaic pavement proves that the intervention of the iconoclasts, after 750, is later than previously thought and is associated with [[Abbasid]] conservatives.<ref>Humbert, Jean-Baptiste. [http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/articles/HumbertGaza.html The rivers of Paradise in the Byzantine Church near Jabaliyah - Gaza] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227015130/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/articles/HumbertGaza.html |date=2009-02-27 }} Studium Biblicum Franciscanum - Jerusalem. 16 December 2000.</ref>

While working on the [[Salah al-Din Road]], laborers accidentally uncovered a monastery from the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Byzantine period]]. The site was excavated by the Palestinian Department of Antiquities. Now the stunning Byzantine mosaics of the monastery are covered with sand to shield them from erosion caused by the direct impact of the winter rain.<ref>[http://www.papp.undp.org/en/newsroom/publications/pdf/focus/04v1.pdf Jabalya Mosaic] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327014858/http://www.papp.undp.org/en/newsroom/publications/pdf/focus/04v1.pdf |date=2009-03-27 }} Programme of Assistance to the Palestinian People. p.6. 2004.</ref> Byzantine ceramics have also been found.<ref>Dauphin, 1998, p. 883</ref>

In 2022, the restoration of a fifth-century Byzantine church carried out by the French organisation Premiere Urgence Internationale and the British Council was finished. The church is decorated with [[mosaic]]s and religious texts written in [[Greek language|Greek]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/restored-byzantine-church-re-opens-in-gaza-171021 | title = Restored Byzantine church re-opens in Gaza |work=www.hurriyetdailynews.com  | date = 26 January 2022 |access-date=31 October 2023}}</ref>

==History==
Jabalia was known for its fertile soil and [[citrus]] trees. The [[Bahri dynasty|Mamluk]] Governor of Gaza [[Sanjar al-Jawli]] ruled the area in the early 14th century and endowed part of Jabalia's land to the [[al-Shamah Mosque]] he built in Gaza.

Until 2014, Jabalia also had the ancient [[Omari Mosque (Jabalia)|Omari Mosque]]. The site was believed to have housed a mosque since the seventh century, and its [[portico]] and [[minaret]] dated back to the 14th century, but the Omari was destroyed by [[Israel]]i [[2014 Gaza War|bombings in 2014]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=AFP |title=Long-neglected Gaza heritage wilts in war |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/long-neglected-gaza-heritage-wilts-in-war/ |access-date=2022-12-16 |website=www.timesofisrael.com |language=en-US}}</ref> The portico consists of three [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s supported by four stone [[column]]s. The arcades have pointed arches and the portico is covered by crossing vaults.<ref>[http://www.mideasttravelling.net/palestine/gaza/gaza_culture.htm Travel in Gaza] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823050026/http://www.mideasttravelling.net/palestine/gaza/gaza_culture.htm |date=2013-08-23 }} MidEastTravelling.</ref>

===Ottoman period===
Incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1517 with all of Palestine,  Jabalia appeared in 1596 [[daftar|tax registers]]  as being in the ''[[Nahiya]]'' of  Gaza of the ''[[Liwa (Arabic)|Liwa]]'' of [[Gaza Sanjak|Gazza]]. It had a population of 331 households, all [[Muslim]], who paid taxes on wheat, barley, vine yards, and fruit trees; a total of 37,640 [[akçe]]. 2/3 of the revenue went to a [[waqf]].<ref name=Hutteroth>Hütteroth and  Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 144</ref>

In 1838, [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]]   noted ''Jebalia'' as a Muslim village, located in the Gaza district.<ref name=Robinsonp118>Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p.  [https://archive.org/stream/biblicalresearch03robiuoft#page/118/mode/1up 118]</ref>

In 1863, [[Victor Guérin]]  found in the mosque fragments of old constructions, and at the  [[well]] some broken [[column]]s.<ref>Guérin, 1869, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/descriptiongog02gu#page/175/mode/1up 175]-176; as referred by Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp03conduoft#page/251/mode/1up  251]</ref>  He further noted: "This village, towards the west, borders on the dunes of the coast. It is surrounded, on the other three sides, by fertile gardens, separated from each other by hedges of cacti and other thorny shrubs. Cultivated with care, they are planted with fig, pomegranate, almond, apricot, lemon and orange trees. There are also a few apple trees. Residents go to sell their fruit in Gaza's various markets."<ref>Guérin, 1869, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/descriptiongog02gu#page/176/mode/1up 176]: "Ce village, vers l'ouest, touche aux dunes de la côte. Il est entouré, des trois autres côtés, de fertiles jardins, que separent entre eux des haies de cactus et d'autres arbustes épineux. Cultivés avec soin, ils sont plantés de figuiers, de grenadiers,  d'amandiers, d'apricotiers, de citronniers et d'orangers. On y aperçoit aussi quelques pommiers. Les habitants vont vendre leurs fruits aux divers  marchés de Gaza."</ref> 

An Ottoman village list from about 1870  found that the village had a population of 828, in a total of  254  houses, though the population count included men, only.<ref name=Socin152>Socin, 1879, p.

It had a mosque named ''Jamia Abu Berjas''.<ref>Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp03conduoft#page/236/mode/1up 236]</ref>

In late 2006, Jabalia was the scene of mass protests against airstrikes on homes. Israel contacted the residences of several [[Hamas]] members who launched missiles at Israeli civilians from the houses, warning them of an airstrike within the next 30 minutes. Neighbors responded by forming a [[human shield]] and successfully stalled the demolition.<ref>{{cite news |author=Conal Urquhart in Tel Aviv |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/20/israel |title=Palestinians use human shield to halt Israeli air strike on militants' homes {{pipe}} World news |work=The Guardian |date= 2006-11-20|access-date=2010-05-08 | location=London}}</ref> In 2021, seven people [[2021 Jabalia accident|were killed]] by a Hamas [[Rocket (weapon)|rocket]].

==Demographics==
Jabalia's residents have various origins, including the [[Hauran]], [[Egypt]], [[Bedouin]] communities, as well as people from [[Hebron]] and [[Jaffa]].<ref name=":02">Grossman, D. (1986).

A number of male [[pseudohermaphrodite]] births have been reported in Jabalia. Jehad Abudaia, a Canadian-Palestinian pediatrician and [[Urology|urologist]], has suggested that [[consanguinity]] due to [[cousin marriage]]s accounts for the prevalence of pseudohermaphrodite births. In the Gaza Strip, pseudohermaphrodite conditions often go undetected for years after birth due to the region's lower standards of medical treatment and diagnostics.<ref>Watson, Ivan.
