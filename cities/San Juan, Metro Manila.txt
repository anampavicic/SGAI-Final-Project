'''San Juan''', officially the '''City of San Juan''' ({{lang-fil|Lungsod ng San Juan}}), is a [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] in the [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]] of the [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 126,347 people.{{PH census|current}} It is geographically located at Metro Manila's approximate center and is also the country's [[Cities of the Philippines#List of cities|smallest city in terms of land area]].

The city is known historically for the site of the first battle of the [[Katipunan]], the organization which led the 1896 [[Philippine Revolution]] against the [[Spanish Empire]]. Notable landmarks today such as [[Pinaglabanan Shrine]] and heritage homes are located in the city. Other locations include [[Greenhills (mixed-use development)|Greenhills]] and [[Bonny Serrano Avenue|Santolan]] Town Plaza, making the city a major shopping hub with a range of upscale, boutique and bargain retail.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/short-sweet-historical-tour-san-juan-city/117710/|title=A short and sweet historical tour of San Juan City|work=The Manila Times|language=en-US|access-date=July 26, 2018}}</ref>

==Etymology==
"San Juan" is a contraction of the city's traditional name of "'''San Juan del Monte'''" ({{literal translation|Saint John of the Mountain}}). As with numerous other places in the Philippines, the name combines a [[patron saint]] and a [[toponym]]; in this case Saint [[John the Baptist]] with the locale's hilly terrain and relatively higher elevation compared to surrounding areas.

The city's official name is "Dakilang Lungsód ng San Juan" ({{literal translation|Great City of San Juan}}).

==History==
===Early history===
During the [[History of the Philippines (900-1521)|pre-Hispanic period]], the area of what is now San Juan was a part of the [[Kingdom of Namayan]], whose last recorded rulers were King Lakan Tagkan and his [[Queen consort|consort]], Bouan.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Huerta |first=Félix de |url=http://archive.org/details/estadogeogrfico00huergoog |title=Estado geográfico, topográfico, estadístico, històrico-religioso, de la santa y apostólica provincia de S. Gregorio Magno |date=1865 |publisher=Binondo, Impr. de M. Sanchez y ca |others=Oxford University}}</ref>

===Spanish colonial era===
{{See also|Santuario del Santo Cristo#History}}
In the late 16th century, the kingdom and other polities in the islands were absorbed into the [[Spanish Crown]], with the realm of Namayan christened as the [[parish]] of ''Santa Ana de Sapa''. (present-day [[Santa Ana, Manila|Santa Ana]], [[Manila]]) The present area of San Juan was meanwhile re-classified as the small ''[[encomienda]]'' (town) of San Juan del Monte in 1590.<ref name="glimpses-history-san-juan">{{Cite book|last=Neira|first=Eladio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mkVxAAAAMAAJ|title=Glimpses Into the History of San Juan, Metro Manila|date=1994|publisher=Life Today Publications|isbn=978-971-8596-09-8|language=en}}</ref>

In 1602, along the Camino de Mandaluyong (now F. Blumentritt Street), the [[Dominican Order]] built a [[novitiate]] house in the town for their immediate use, where ageing or convalescing [[friar]]s stayed. Within the area, the Dominicans also constructed a [[convent]] and a stone church, the [[Santuario del Santo Cristo]], dedicating it to the [[Christian cross|Holy Cross]]. To this day, the thrice-rebuilt church stands on the same site, adjacent to [[Aquinas School]] and Dominican College.<ref name="glimpses-history-san-juan" />

Given the isolation that the town had from the city of [[Manila#Spanish period|Manila]], the [[Captaincy General of the Philippines|colonial government]] decided to establish a heavily fortified [[gunpowder magazine]] called the ''Almacén de Pólvora'' (also known as ''El Polvorín'') in San Juan del Monte in 1771. The gunpowder magazine (located at present-day San Juan Elementary School) was situated along the banks of the Salapang River (now known as [[San Juan River (Metro Manila)#Tributaries|Salapán Creek]]), with access provided by the Camino de Mariquina (now N. Domingo Street), which connected Manila and the nearby barrio of [[Santa Mesa]] across the [[San Juan River Bridge]] to the ''[[pueblo]]'' of Mariquina (now [[Marikina]]).<ref name="glimpses-history-san-juan" />

====Municipality established====
In 1783, San Juan del Monte was promoted to a [[Municipalities of the Philippines|municipality]], separating it from the Santa Ana parish and giving it its own local government as a barrio of the [[Manila (province)|Province of Manila]]. As a result, the old ''[[poblacion]]'' at Santuario del Santo Cristo was moved to the Camino de Mariquina, where a new municipal hall (now the San Juan Medical Center) and a town plaza (now the San Juan Plaza Mayor) was constructed.<ref name="glimpses-history-san-juan" />

In 1892, Father [[:es:Bernardino Nozaleda|Bernardino Nozaleda]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila|Archbishop of Manila]], approved the creation of a new parish for the municipality of San Juan del Monte, with the [[Franciscans]] establishing the San Juan Bautista Church (now Pinaglabanan Church) and a [[Clergy house|parochial house]] in the area now known as Pinaglabanan Street.<ref name="glimpses-history-san-juan" />

====The Philippine revolution====

[[File:02227jfAlmacen de Polvora San Juan City Elementary School Plaza Mayorfvf 18.jpg|thumb|A silo of the former ''Almacén de Pólvora (El Polvorín)'' inside the San Juan Elementary School grounds.]]
When the [[Philippine Revolution]] against Spain broke out in August 1896, the [[Katipunan]] revolutionaries led by [[Andrés Bonifacio]] and his aide [[Emilio Jacinto]] made their way from [[Cry of Pugad Lawin|Pugad Lawin]] in [[Caloocan]] (now part of [[Quezon City]]) to attack the ''El Polvorín'' and its military garrison in San Juan del Monte on the morning of August 30, 1896. Defended by a hundred Spanish troops consisting of [[infantry]] and [[artillery]], the Katipuneros were able to eliminate the garrison commander and an artilleryman, forcing the remaining Spanish troops to retreat to the nearby [[El Deposito]] water [[reservoir]] near the San Juan Bautista Church. Sustaining heavy losses, the Katipuneros were unable to capture El Polvorín, and retreated south towards Mandaluyong, where Bonifacio reorganized the surviving Katipuneros and issued a war manifesto, leading Katipuneros in other places to organize Filipinos to rise up in arms against the colonial government as revolts spread all across the archipelago.<ref name="nhcp-pinaglabanan">{{cite web|url=http://nhcp.gov.ph/pinaglabanan-memorial-shrine/|title=National Historical Commission of the Philippines official website|website=Pinaglabanan Memorial Shrine|access-date=July 28, 2018|archive-date=July 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150719181837/http://nhcp.gov.ph/pinaglabanan-memorial-shrine/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="glimpses-history-san-juan" />

===American invasion and Philippine Commonwealth===
{{main article|Philippine-American War|Commonwealth of the Philippines}}
Following the end of the Philippine Revolution and the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1898 that seceded the Philippines to the [[United States]], the [[First Philippine Republic]] that succeeded the Katipunan distrusted the occupying American forces that were arriving in droves, with both sides wanting to engage in combat. On the morning of February 4, 1899, Filipino troops from the 4th Company of the [[Morong Command|Morong Battalion]] under Captain Serapio Narvaez were fired upon by American troops of the [[1st Nebraska Infantry Regiment (1898)|1st Nebraska Infantry Regiment]] from their defense line on the [[Santa Mesa]] side (now part of [[Sampaloc, Manila|Sampaloc]]).<ref name="birth-of-an-army">{{Cite web |title=The Birth of an Army |url=https://www.oocities.org/afpmuseum/history/history_chapter01.htm |access-date=April 22, 2022 |website=Armed Forces of the Philippines Museum}}</ref>

The first shot was exchanged by Private [[William W. Grayson]], an American sentry from the [[1st Nebraska Infantry Regiment (1898)|1st Nebraska Infantry Regiment]] of the [[United States Volunteers|United States Volunteer Army]], who killed Filipino corporal Anastacio Felix and another Filipino soldier of the [[Philippine Revolutionary Army]], firing the first shot of the [[Philippine–American War]]. This prompted lines of Filipino troops in San Juan del Monte to open fire at the line of American troops in Santa Mesa.<ref name="birth-of-an-army"/> The first shot was previously believed to have been exchanged at the [[San Juan River Bridge]] until studies by Filipino historian [[Benito J. Legarda]] concluded that the shot was not fired at the bridge, but was instead fired at what is now the corner of Sociego Street and Silencio Street in Santa Mesa.<ref name="sampaloc-shot">{{Cite journal |last1=Fernandez |first1=Doreen G. |last2=Legarda |first2=Benito J. |date=2002 |title=Review of The Hills of Sampaloc: The Opening Actions of the Philippine-American War February 4-5, 1899, Benito J.

Throughout the war, various regiments of the United States Volunteer Army carried out multiple skirmishes against militias and soldiers of the First Philippine Republic in towns along the Camino de Mariquina, where they had cleared out Filipino forces at the ''El Deposito'' reservoir, its pumping station road (now Pinaglabanan Street, part of [[Bonny Serrano Avenue|Santolan Road]]), and the santuario.<ref name="oregon-volunteers">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CMEelET9LYC |title=The Official Records of the Oregon Volunteers in the Spanish War and Philippine Insurrection |date=1903|last1=Adjutant-General's Office |first1=Oregon }}</ref>

Both the revolution and the war caused many of the original residents of San Juan del Monte to evacuate en masse, permanently settling in neighboring towns. This led to many lots becoming abandoned. From 1898 to 1899, some residents returned to the town, resettling in [[shack]]s. However, due to unsanitary conditions, a [[malaria]] epidemic broke out in the area, with many casualties.<ref name="glimpses-history-san-juan"/><ref name="BriefHistoryOfSanJuan">{{Cite book |last=Artiaga |first=Santiago |title=Brief History of San Juan del Monte, Rizal |publisher=[[National Library of the Philippines]] |year=1951 |url=https://nlpdl.nlp.gov.ph/HD01/p40/cm22/md1/bs/datejpg.htm }}</ref>{{rp|page=21}}

Following the end of the Philippine-American War, the municipality was repopulated by families coming from Mariquina and [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]].<ref name="BriefHistoryOfSanJuan" />{{rp|page=21}} The Dominicans had also returned to the municipality to establish their ownership of the Santo Cristo hacienda before the new American [[Insular Government of the Philippine Islands|colonial government]]. As a result, much of San Juan del Monte was being leased to the municipal government by Dominican hacienda owners until these lands were eventually purchased by the municipal government.<ref name="glimpses-history-san-juan" />

In 1901, the municipality was incorporated into the new [[Rizal (province)|province of Rizal]] through Act No. 137,<ref>{{Cite PH act|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l2485 |date=June 11, 1901 |title=An Act Extending the Provisions of the Provincial Government Act to the Province of Rizal |chamber=Act |number=942|access-date=June 12, 2022}}</ref> with former Katipunan San Juan chapter ''sanggunian'' Andres Soriano serving as its first [[municipal president]].<ref name="glimpses-history-san-juan" /> In 1903, it was merged into the municipality of San Felipe Neri (present-day [[Mandaluyong]]) through Act No. 942 of the [[Taft Commission]].<ref name="Act-942">{{Cite PH act|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l89ad |date=October 12, 1903 |title=An Act Reducing the Thirty-Two Municipalities of the Province of Rizal to Fifteen |chamber=Act |number=942}}</ref> San Felipe Neri later became the capital of Rizal for several months in 1904.

In 1916, the municipal government purchased the land along the intersection of N. Domingo and F. Blumentritt Streets, where the town market (present-day Agora Market) was located. Likewise, in 1919, businessmen Eusebio Orense and Florencio G. Diaz purchased a great bulk of the remaining hacienda lands, selling it to a Filipino-American consortium developing the San Juan Heights, a series of new [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] developments all across the area. It was around this time that the municipality's name was contracted to '''San Juan'''.<ref name="glimpses-history-san-juan"/>

A report made by the Rizal provincial government in 1933 noted that San Juan increased in population due to the development of residential subdivisions, such as San Juan Heights, Manila Heights, [[San Francisco del Monte|San Francisco del Monte Heights]], Addition Hills, [[Mariana, Quezon City|New Manila]], and Rosario Heights.

==Geography==
[[File:Greenhills area - aerial shot (San Juan)(2015-05-26).jpg|thumb|Aerial view of San Juan's [[Greenhills, San Juan|Greenhills]] area]]
San Juan is the least-extensive city in the Philippines with a total area of just {{convert|595|ha|sqmi}}.

San Juan is bounded by [[Quezon City]] on the north and east, [[Mandaluyong]] on the south, and the [[Manila|City of Manila]] in the west.

The territory of San Juan was once much larger than it is now, having been adjacent to [[Caloocan]] and [[Marikina]] prior to the creation of [[Quezon City]]. Parts of the present-day Districts [[Quezon City's 1st congressional district|1]], [[Quezon City's 3rd congressional district|3]], and [[Quezon City's 4th congressional district|4]] of Quezon City, as well as areas of [[Mandaluyong]], were originally within the town's colonial-era borders. This also explains why San Juan Reservoir is in nearby Horseshoe Village, a subdivision now part of Quezon City.

[[File:Pinaglabanan Archdiocesan Shrine 2024-06-24.jpg|thumb|235x235px|Archdiocesan Shrine of Saint John the Baptist]]
The city also has several notable places of worship. [[Pinaglabanan Church|Archdiocesan Shrine of Saint John the Baptist]], more commonly known as "''Pinaglabanan'' Church", is where the city's patron saint, [[John the Baptist]], is enshrined. The [[Santuario del Santo Cristo]] is the settlement's oldest existing church, while Mary the Queen Parish in West Greenhills serves the local [[Filipino-Chinese]] community.

From 1925 to 1971, the [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] once headquartered in the town at its former Central Office Complex, now known as the Locale of F. Manalo. It features Art-Deco designed ensembles, crafted by [[National Artist of the Philippines|National Artist for Architecture]] [[Juan Nakpil]]. The chapel is the centerpiece of the Complex, which also contains the old Central Office and Pastoral House that was the home of the church's first [[Executive Minister of the Iglesia ni Cristo|Executive Minister]], [[Felix Manalo]], along with other Ministers and Evangelical Workers. When Manalo died in 1963, a mausoleum was constructed on the grounds of the Complex by architect Carlos Santos-Viola. INC adherents in San Juan comprise 4.2% of the city population.

San Juan also has a number of Evangelical churches. Through the APOI (Association of Pastors for Outreach and Intercession), they have contributed to the spiritual atmosphere of the city. Every January, the city celebrates the National Bible Week, where the reading of the Scripture happens during the flag raising ceremony in the City Hall. Through the blessing of the mayor, a bible was planted in the heart of the new city hall during its construction. Major evangelical churches like [[Jesus Is Lord Church Worldwide|Jesus is Lord]] and [[Victory (church)|Victory]] Greenhills are also found in the city of San Juan.

San Juan is also home to two [[Islam]]ic [[mosque]]s, namely: Masjid Hamza Bin Ahmed in Balong-Bato and Greenhills Masjid at [[Greenhills (mixed-use development)|Greenhills]].

On the 2024 [[Calendar of saints|feast]] of St. [[John the Baptist]], the local government declared him as [[patron saint]] of San Juan City.<ref>{{cite news |last1=  Locus|first1=  Sundy |title=San Juan City declares St. John the Baptist as patron saint|url= https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/metro/911036/san-juan-city-declares-st-john-the-baptist-as-patron-saint/story/|access-date=June 28, 2024 |publisher=[[GMA Integrated News]] |date=June 24, 2024}}</ref>
