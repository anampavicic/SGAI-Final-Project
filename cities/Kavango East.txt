'''Kavango East''' is one of the fourteen [[regions of Namibia]]. Its capital is [[Rundu]], its governor is [[Bonifatius Wakudumo]]. The region was created in 2013 when the [[Kavango Region]] was split into Kavango East and [[Kavango West]]. The only self-governing settlements in Kavango East are the capital Rundu and the village of [[Divundu]].

The region contains the western half of the [[Caprivi Strip]]. In the north, Kavango East borders the [[Cuando Cubango]] Province of [[Angola]], and in the south and southeast the [[North-West District (Botswana)|North-West]] District of Botswana. Domestically, it borders the following regions:
*[[Zambezi Region|Zambezi]] – east
*[[Otjozondjupa]] – southwest
*[[Kavango West]] – west

Because of its rather high rainfall compared to most other parts of Namibia and its location on the [[Kavango River]] after which it is named, this region has agricultural potential for the cultivation of a variety of crops, as well as for organised forestry and agro-forestry, which stimulate furniture making and related industries. Kavango East and its sister region Kavango West are nevertheless the poorest regions in Namibia.<ref>{{cite news | title=Kavango East not a poor region - governor | last=Kandjimi | first=Shoki | date=5 November 2020 | newspaper=[[New Era (Namibia)|New Era]] | page=1 | url=https://neweralive.na/posts/kavango-east-not-a-poor-region-governor}}</ref>

==Politics==
The Fourth Delimitation Commission of Namibia, responsible for recommending on the country's [[Administrative divisions of Namibia|administrative divisions]] suggested in August 2013 to split the [[Kavango Region]] into two. Then-president [[Hifikepunye Pohamba]] enacted the recommendations. As a result, two new regions of Kavango East and [[Kavango West]] were created.<ref name=split/> As of 2020, Kavango East had 80,450 registered voters.<ref name=election2020>{{Cite web | title=Regional Council 2020 Election Results | publisher=[[Electoral Commission of Namibia]] | date=18 January 2021 | series=''Interactive map'' | url=http://elections.na/ | accessdate=11 May 2021 | archive-date=12 June 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210612210020/https://elections.na/ | url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Transport==
There is a particular dearth of north-south roads in the Region, apart from the Rundu-[[Grootfontein]] main road. Rundu has a small airstrip to accommodate medium-sized tourist or cargo aircraft in daylight only. The poor condition of the roads and the long distances had a negative effect on tourism; this situation was improved by the completion of the [[Trans–Caprivi Highway]]. A major highway connecting Rundu to western Kavango and the [[Ohangwena Region]] is under construction.
