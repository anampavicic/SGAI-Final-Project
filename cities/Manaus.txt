'''Manaus''' ({{IPA|pt|mɐˈnaws, ma-|lang|Br-Manaus.ogg}}) is the [[List of capitals of subdivisions of Brazil|capital]] and largest city of the [[States of Brazil|Brazilian state]] of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]]. It is the [[List of largest cities in Brazil|seventh-largest city]] in Brazil, with an estimated 2022 population of 2,063,689 distributed over a land area of about {{cvt|11401|km2}}. Located at the east centre of the state, the city is the centre of the [[Greater Manaus|Manaus metropolitan area]] and the largest metropolitan area in the [[North Region, Brazil|North Region of Brazil]] by urban landmass. It is situated near [[Meeting of Waters|the confluence of]] the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Negro]] and [[Amazon River|Amazon]] rivers. It is one of the two cities in the Amazon Rainforest with a population of over 1 million people, alongside [[Belém]].

The city was founded in 1669 as the Fort of São José do Rio Negro. It was elevated to a [[town]] in 1832 with the name of "Manaus", an altered spelling of the indigenous Manaós peoples, and legally transformed into a [[city]] on October 24, 1848, with the name of ''Cidade da Barra do Rio Negro'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for "The City of the Margins of the Black River". On September 4, 1856, it returned to its original name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ywamcity.org/city.asp?id=86|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701170518/http://www.ywamcity.org/city.asp?id=86|url-status=dead|title=About Manaus|archive-date=1 July 2009}}</ref>

Rubber made it the richest city in South America during the late 1800s. Rubber also helped Manaus earn its nickname, ''the Paris of the Tropics''. Many wealthy European families settled in Manaus and brought their love for sophisticated [[Art of Europe|European art]], [[History of architecture#Europe to 1600|architecture]], and [[Culture of Europe|culture]] with them. Manaus was one of the twelve Brazilian host cities of the [[2014 World Cup]], as well as one of the five subsections of the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].

== Etymology ==
The name Manaus comes from the native people called ''Manaós'', which means ''Mother of the Gods''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icmbio.gov.br/parnaanavilhanas/images/stories/anavilhanas_map2_eng.pdf |title=Manaus |access-date=19 January 2020 |publisher=ICMBio |language=en |archive-date=1 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201001073105/https://www.icmbio.gov.br/parnaanavilhanas/images/stories/anavilhanas_map2_eng.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Early settlement of Manaus ===
The history of the European colonization of Manaus began in 1499 with the Spanish arrival at the mouth of the Amazon River. The Spanish then continued to colonize the region north of Brazil. Development continued in 1668–1669 with the building of the Fort of São José da Barra do Rio Negro by the Portuguese in order to ensure its predominance in the region, especially against the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], at that time headquartered in what is today [[Suriname]]. The fort was constructed in rock and clay, with four [[cannon]]s guarding the curtains.<ref name="calvarymanaus.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.calvarymanaus.com/manaus.php |title=About Manaus |website=www.calvarymanaus.com |access-date=2014-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140128003943/http://www.calvarymanaus.com/manaus.php |archive-date=2014-01-28 |url-status=live}}</ref> It continued to function for more than 100 years. Next to the fort there were many indigenous [[mestizo]]s, who helped in its construction and began to live in the vicinity.<ref name="calvarymanaus.com"/>

The population grew so much that, in 1695, the missionaries ([[Carmelite]], [[Jesuit]], [[Franciscan]]) built a nearby [[chapel]] dedicated to ''Nossa Senhora da Conceição ''(Our Lady of the Conception), who, in time, became the patron saint of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://creyete.com/camera/331-Manaus---Amazonas/ |title=creyete.com |website=creyete.com |access-date=2009-07-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708203500/http://creyete.com/camera/331-Manaus---Amazonas/ |archive-date=2011-07-08 |url-status=live}}</ref> A Royal Charter of March 3, 1755 created the captaincy of São José do Rio Negro, with capital in Mariuá (now [[Barcelos, Amazonas|Barcelos]]), but with the governor, Lobo D'Almada, fearing a Spanish invasion, the seat went back to Lugar de Barra in 1791. Being located at the confluence of the Rio Negro and Amazon Rivers, it was a strategic point. On November 13, 1832, Lugar da Barra was elevated to [[town]] status and named Manaus. On October 24, 1848, under Law 145 of the Provincial Assembly of Para, it was renamed the City of Barra do Rio Negro. On September 4, 1856, the governor, Herculano Ferreira Pena, finally gave it the name "Manaus".<ref>[http://planetwildlife.pl/information/places/manaus?section=culture Manaus History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201174819/http://planetwildlife.pl/information/places/manaus?section=culture |date=2014-02-01 }}</ref>

The [[Cabanagem]] was the revolt in which blacks, Native Americans, and [[mestizo]]s fought against the white political elite and took power in 1835. The Cabanagem reduced the population of the then state of [[Pará|Grão-Pará]] from about 100,000 to 60,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://noticias.uol.com.br/licaodecasa/materias/fundamental/historia/brasil/ult1689u20.jhtm |title=Cabanagem (1835–1840): Uma das mais sangrentas rebeliões do período regencial |work=[[Universo Online]] Liçao de Casa |author=Renato Cancian |access-date=12 November 2007 |language=pt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102212940/http://noticias.uol.com.br/licaodecasa/materias/fundamental/historia/brasil/ult1689u20.jhtm |archive-date=2 November 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> The involvement of rebels from the Upper Amazon (Manaus today) in what was originally a movement based in [[Belém]] was crucial for the birth of the current state of the Amazon. During the brief period of revolution, the Cabanos of the Upper Amazon, bands of rebels, roamed throughout the region, occupying Manaus twice, and, in most settlements, their arrival was greeted by the non-white population spontaneously joining their ranks, leading to a greater number of adherents to the movement. With that there was an integration of people in the region thus forming the state.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sampaio |first1=Patricia |title=Crônicas de gente pouco importante IV: Bernardo de Sena – negro, cabano e "prefeito" |url=http://amazoniareal.com.br/cronicas-de-gente-pouco-importante-iv-bernardo-de-sena-negro-cabano-e-prefeito/ |website=Amazônia Real |date=24 February 2015 |access-date=8 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123035521/http://amazoniareal.com.br/cronicas-de-gente-pouco-importante-iv-bernardo-de-sena-negro-cabano-e-prefeito/ |archive-date=23 January 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Rubber boom ===
Manaus was at the center of the Amazon region's [[rubber boom]] during the late 19th century. For a time, it was "one of the gaudiest cities of the world".<ref>David Grann. ''The Lost City of Z''. Random House. New York: 2009. Page 87.</ref> Historian Robin Furneaux wrote of this period, "No extravagance, however absurd, deterred" the rubber barons. "If one rubber baron bought a vast yacht, another would install a tame lion in his villa, and a third would water his horse on champagne."<ref>Robin Furneaux. ''The Amazon: the Story of a Great River''. London: Hamish Hamilton, 1969. Page 153.</ref> The city built a grand opera house, with vast domes and gilded balconies, and using marble, glass, and crystal, from around Europe. The opera house cost ten million (public-funded) dollars. In one season, half the members of one visiting opera troupe died of [[yellow fever]].<ref>Grann 87.</ref> The opera house, called the [[Teatro Amazonas]], was effectively closed for most of the 20th Century. However it was used in scenes of the [[Werner Herzog]] film ''[[Fitzcarraldo]]'' (1982). After a gap of almost 90 years, it reopened to produce live opera in 1997 and is now attracting performers from all over the world.<ref name="opera">{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/1310102/A-night-at-the-opera-and-14-days-on-the-Amazon-to-get-there.html |title=Christina Lamb, "A night at the opera - and 14 days on the Amazon to get there", ''The Sunday Telegraph'', London, 17th June 2001 |date=17 June 2001 |access-date=2018-04-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620132248/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/1310102/A-night-at-the-opera-and-14-days-on-the-Amazon-to-get-there.html |archive-date=2017-06-20 |url-status=live}}</ref>

When the seeds of the rubber tree were smuggled out of the Amazon region to be cultivated on plantations in Southeast Asia,{{refn|For an account, see ''The Thief at the End of the World: Rubber, Power, and the Seeds of Empire,'' by Joe Jackson.|group=Note}} Brazil and Peru lost their monopoly on the product. The rubber boom ended abruptly, many people left its major cities, and Manaus fell into poverty. The rubber boom had made possible electrification of the city before it was installed in many European cities, but the end of the rubber boom made the generators too expensive to run. The city was not able to generate electricity again for years.<ref name="opera"/>

===Free zone===
In the 1960s during the establishment of the military dictatorship in Brazil, the newly installed government concerned about the "demographic gap in Brazil", began to introduce numerous projects in the interior of the country, especially in the Amazon region, with the introduction of the Manaus free trade zone in 1967,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/Del0288.htm |title=Decree-Law. 288 of 28 February 1967. |last=Presidency of the Republic |language=pt |date=February 28, 1967 |publisher=Civil House; Subheading for Legal Affairs |access-date=June 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705234153/http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/del0288.htm |archive-date=5 July 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> and with the opening of new roads within the region, the city had a wide period of investments in financial and economic capital, both national and international, attracted by the tax incentives granted by the free zone, in this period, Manaus had enormous demographic growth becoming one of the most populous cities in Brazil.<ref name="IBGE (Brazil)">{{cite web |url=https://cidades.ibge.gov.br/v4/brasil/am/manaus/panorama |title=Panorama Manaus |publisher=IBGE- (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) |access-date=June 21, 2017 |language=pt |website=cidades.ibge.gov.br |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901031050/https://cidades.ibge.gov.br/v4/brasil/am/manaus/panorama |archive-date=September 1, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:Amazon CIAT (5).jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the [[Amazon Rainforest]], near Manaus]]
The largest city in northern Brazil, Manaus occupies an area of {{convert|11401|km2|0|abbr=out}}, with a density of {{convert|158.06|PD/sqkm|PD/sqmi}}. It is the neighboring city of [[Presidente Figueiredo]], [[Careiro]], [[Iranduba]], [[Rio Preto da Eva]], [[Itacoatiara, Amazonas|Itacoatiara]], and [[Novo Airão]].

=== Vegetation ===
Manaus is located in the middle of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon Rainforest]]. The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining [[rainforest]]s and comprises the largest and most species-rich tract of [[tropical rainforest]] in the world. Wet tropical forests are the most species-rich [[biome]], and tropical forests in the [[Americas]] are consistently more species-rich than the wet forests in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]].<ref name="Turner 2001">Turner, I.M. 2001. ''The ecology of trees in the tropical rain forest''. [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge. {{ISBN|0-521-80183-4}}</ref> As the largest tract of tropical rainforest in the Americas, the Amazonian rainforests have unparalleled [[biodiversity]]. More than one-third of all species in the world live in the Amazon rainforest.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/biomes |title=Biomes - Conserving Biomes - WWF |website=World Wildlife Fund |access-date=2019-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415012629/http://worldwildlife.org/biomes |archive-date=2013-04-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Green areas ===
[[File:Curvas_do_Parque_Nacional_de_Anavilhanas.jpg|thumb|[[Anavilhanas National Park]].]]
[[File:Novo_airão_2.jpg|thumb|Anavilhas National Park ground view.]]
Despite being located in the Amazon, Manaus is densely developed and has few green areas in the city. The largest green areas are:
* Mindu Park, located in the center-south of the city, the district Park 10. The Park of Mindú, established in 1989, is one of the largest and most visited parks in the city.
* Bilhares Park, established in 2005, located in the south-central region of Manaus, in the neighborhood of {{ill|Planalto (Manaus)|pt|lt=Planalto}} ("plateau").
* Area of the green hill of Aleixo, created in the 1980s, located in the east of the city and is one of the largest urban green areas.
* [[Sumaúma State Park]], a state park located in the north of Manaus, in the New Town district. It is the smallest state park of the Brazilian Amazon Basin.
* [[Castanheiras Pied Tamarin Wildlife Refuge]], a {{convert|95|ha}} refuge created in 1982 to protect a population of endangered [[pied tamarin]]s. 
* [[Adolfo Ducke Forest Reserve]], a biological reserve established in 1963, and covers an area of 100 square kilometres (10,000 hectares, 39 square miles). The Reserve is managed by INPA (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia—National Institute for Amazon Research).
* Part of the [[Anavilhanas National Park]], a {{convert|350018|ha}} conservation unit that was originally an ecological station created in 1981.<ref>{{citation |ref={{harvid|PARNA de Anavilhanas – ISA}} |language=pt |title=PARNA de Anavilhanas |publisher=ISA: Instituto Socioambiental |url=http://uc.socioambiental.org/uc/564 |access-date=2016-04-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506022242/http://uc.socioambiental.org/uc/564 |archive-date=2016-05-06 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
Manaus has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (''Am'') according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system, just dry enough in its driest month to not be a [[tropical rainforest climate]], with the average annual compensated temperature of {{convert|27.4|°C}} and high [[air humidity]], with a rainfall index around {{cvt|2300|mm|1}} annually. The seasons are relatively well-defined concerning rain: July to September is relatively dry, and December to May is very rainy. Thunderstorms are frequent every day in the summer, but they can occur at any time of the year. There have been occasional occurrences of [[hail]] in the city.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://g1.globo.com/am/amazonas/noticia/2011/10/chuva-de-granizo-atinge-diversos-pontos-de-manaus.html |publisher=G1 Amazonas |title=Chuva de granizo atinge diversos pontos de Manaus |newspaper=Amazonas |date=25 October 2011 |access-date=23 February 2015 |language=pt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223200628/http://g1.globo.com/am/amazonas/noticia/2011/10/chuva-de-granizo-atinge-diversos-pontos-de-manaus.html |archive-date=23 February 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Due to the city's proximity to the [[equator]], the heat is constant in the local climate. There are no cold days in winter, and rarely very intense polar [[air masses]] in the [[Centro-Sul|South-Central]] part of Brazil and in the southwest of the [[Amazon basin|Amazon]] have some effect on the city, as occurred in August 1955. But although they are rare, they influence the climate, causing the temperature to drop to {{convert|18|°C|1}} or below.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://g1.globo.com/am/amazonas/noticia/2013/07/frente-fria-deve-atingir-manaus-e-temperatura-pode-cair-para-18c.html |publisher=G1 Amazonas |title=Frente fria deve atingir Manaus e temperatura pode cair para 18°C |date=24 July 2013 |access-date=9 April 2015 |language=pt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223200631/http://g1.globo.com/am/amazonas/noticia/2013/07/frente-fria-deve-atingir-manaus-e-temperatura-pode-cair-para-18c.html |archive-date=23 February 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> The proximity to the forest usually avoids extremes of heat and makes the city wet.<ref name="climate 3">{{cite web |url=http://www.achetudoeregiao.com.br/am/manaus.htm |publisher=Ache tudo e região |title=Cidades do Amazonas - Manaus |access-date=6 June 2012 |language=pt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508001513/http://www.achetudoeregiao.com.br/AM/manaus.htm |archive-date=8 May 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>

According to the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET), the highest temperature registered in the city was {{convert|39|°C|1}}, in 2015 and the lowest was {{convert|12|°C|1}} in 1989.

On November 26, 2009, a case of [[acid rain]] was recorded in Manaus. Air pollution, caused in large part by the accumulation of smoke from burning, associated with the [[sulfur dioxide]] emitted by cars, was the cause of this phenomenon. Although the incidence of acid rain is common in some Brazilian capitals where there is a great concentration of cars, in Manaus and other cities of the [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]] the situation is aggravated by the prolonged period of drought with the smoke from forest fires.<ref name="chuva ácida">{{cite web |url=http://portalamazonia.globo.com/pscript/noticias/noticias.php?idN=96531 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130426063827/http://portalamazonia.globo.com/pscript/noticias/noticias.php?idN=96531 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-04-26 |publisher=Portal Amazônia |title=Instituto de meteorologia registra chuva ácida em Manaus |language=pt}}</ref>

==Hydrology==
The urban area covers all or part of four river basins, all tributaries of the Rio Negro. The São Raimundo and Educandos streams are completely contained in the city. The [[Tarumã Açu River|Tarumã Açu]] forms the western boundary of the city in its lower reaches, and is fed by several tributaries that originate in the Ducke Reserve and run through the north and west of the city. The [[Puraquequara River|Puraquequara]] forms the east boundary of the urban area in its lower section.<ref>{{citation |language=pt |last1=Rovere |first1=Ana Lúcia Nadalutti La |last2=Crespo |first2=Samyra |last3=Velloso |first3=Rui |page=68 |publisher=PNUMA; Brasil.

Manaus is the seventh largest city in [[Brazil]], after [[São Paulo]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Salvador (Bahia)|Salvador]], [[Brasília]], [[Fortaleza]] and [[Belo Horizonte]].

The city's population growth is above the national average, and 10% above the average for the capital (Brasilia). Most of the population is located in the North and East regions of the city, and the New Town (northern area) the [[neighborhood]] is the most populous, with more than 260,000 residents.

According to the results of the last census, the city's population increased from 343,038 inhabitants in 1960 to 622,733 in 1970. By 1990, the population grew to 1,025,979 inhabitants, increasing its density to {{convert|90|PD/sqkm|PD/sqmi}}.

[[File:Igreja de São Sebastião, Manaus.jpg|thumb|[[Church of Saint Sebastian (Manaus)|St. Sebastian Church]]]]
The city has been influenced by [[Catholicism]] since the time of European colonialism, and the majority of Manauenses are [[Catholic]]—there are nevertheless dozens of different Protestant denominations in the city. [[Judaism]], [[Candomblé]], [[Islam]], and [[Spiritualism (movement)|spiritualism]], among others, are also practised.<ref name="calvarymanaus.com"/> There is a community of [[Amazonian Jews]] in Manaus. The city's [[Metropolitan Cathedral of Our Lady of the Conception, Manaus|Catedral Metropolitana Nossa Senhora da Conceição]] is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manaus]].

The city has a very diverse presence of Protestant or Reformed faiths, such as the [[Presbyterian Church of Brazil|Presbyterian Church]], [[Calvary Chapel]], For Christ International Church of Grace of God, Pentecostal Church of God in Brazil, [[Methodist Church]], the [[Anglican Episcopal Church]], the [[Baptist Church]], an [[Assembly of God]] Church, the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], the [[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]], and the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] among others. These churches are experiencing considerable growth, mainly in the outskirts of the city. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] also has a large presence, with a [[Manaus Brazil Temple|LDS temple]] having been built in the city, the sixth in Brazil.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/manaus-brazil-temple-is-dedicated |title=Manaus Brazil Temple Is Dedicated |date=2012-06-11 |website=Mormon Newsroom |language=en |access-date=2019-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630020502/https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/manaus-brazil-temple-is-dedicated |archive-date=2019-06-30 |url-status=live}}</ref>

== Districts and regions ==
=== Metropolitan region ===
The Metropolitan Region of Manaus (RMM) is a [[metropolitan area]] that comprises eight [[cities]] of the Amazonas state, but without conurbation.

=== Regions ===
Manaus is divided into seven regions: North, Southern, Central-South, East, West, Mid-West, and Rural area. The eastern region of the city is the most populated, with approximately 600,000 inhabitants (2007).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hploco.com/manaus/Regiao_Metropolitana.html |title=East zone of Manaus |access-date=2009-07-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923210258/http://www.hploco.com/manaus/Regiao_Metropolitana.html |archive-date=2016-09-23 |url-status=live}}</ref> The northern region of the city has had the highest rate of population growth in recent years, and has the largest [[neighborhood]] of the city, the Nova Cidade neighborhood. The Center-South region has the highest [[per capita income]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.revistaautor.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=462&Itemid=60 |title=Center-South region of Manaus |access-date=2009-07-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715175518/http://www.revistaautor.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=462&Itemid=60 |archive-date=2011-07-15 |url-status=live}}</ref> The Eastern Zone is known for having a large number of hills.

=== Neighborhoods ===
{{Further|:pt:Lista de bairros de Manaus|Compensa}}
The first [[neighborhood]] (bairro) established in Manaus was Educandos. From there, other areas of the city began to be occupied since the arrival of migrants from other regions of Brazil.

Manaus has the largest neighborhood in Latin America, the neighborhood of Cidade Nova, which has 264,449 inhabitants, but it is estimated that the population exceeds 300,000 inhabitants. Cidade Nova is larger than all the [[city|cities]] inside the rest of Amazonas state.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/cidadesat/link.php?uf=am |title=Amazonas City Populations, Retrieved on June 20, 2012 |access-date=June 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130031523/http://www.ibge.gov.br/cidadesat/link.php?uf=am |archive-date=November 30, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> With the permanence and the strengthening of [[Free Economic Zone of Manaus]], the city began to receive investments and constant migration of people from many parts of the state and [[northern Brazil]].

The wealthiest neighborhood in Manaus is Adrianópolis, located in the Central-South Area of the city. Downtown Manaus is located in the Southern area of the city, next to [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro River]]. After years of development, the historical center has been neglected by the authorities and it has become an area mostly for commerce and poor housing. There is a plan to restore the city centre to its former glory by removing beggars and irregular sellers from sidewalks and by doing that provide more safety for tourists and locals who are trying to walk in the historical areas of the city. All these plans were prompted by the 2014 World Cup.

=== Free Trade Zone ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2023}}
The initial idea of a Free Trade Port in Manaus came from Deputy Francisco Pereira da Silva and was subsequently formalized by Law No. 3.173 on June 6, 1957. The project was approved by the National Congress on October 23, 1951, under No. 1.310 and regulated by Decree No. 47.757 on February 2, 1960. It was then amended by rapporteur Maurício Jopper, an engineer, who by agreement with the original author, justified the creation of a Free Trade Zone instead of a Free Trade Port.

For the first ten years, the ZFM (Manaus Free Trade Zone) was located in a warehouse rented from Manaus Harbour, in the Port of Manaus, and relied on federal funds. It was perhaps due to this lack of its own resources that there was little credibility in the project. On February 28, 1967, President [[Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco|Castelo Branco]] signed Decree-Law No. 288, which redefined the Manaus Free Trade Zone in more concrete terms. The new Decree-Law stipulated that the Manaus Free Trade Zone would have a radius of {{cvt|10|km|mi}} with an industrial center as well as an agricultural center and that these would be given the economic means to allow for regional development in order to lift the Amazon out of the economic isolation that it had fallen into at that time.

On August 28, 1967, the Manaus Free Trade Zone Authority, SUBFRAME, was created. SUBFRAME is an independent body with its own legal status and assets and has financial and administrative autonomy. Tax incentives and the subsequent complementary legislation created comparative advantages in the region with respect to other parts of the country and as a result the Manaus Free Trade Zone attracted new investment to the area. These incentives constituted tax exemptions administered federally by SUBFRAME and SUDAM.

== Transportation ==

=== Airports ===
[[File:Aeroporto-de-Manaus.jpg|thumb|[[Eduardo Gomes International Airport|Manaus International Airport]]]]
[[Eduardo Gomes International Airport]] is the airport serving Manaus. The airport has two passenger terminals, one for scheduled flights and the other for regional aviation. It also has three [[cargo]] [[Airport terminal|terminal]]s.

Eduardo Gomes International Airport is Brazil's third largest in freight movement,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.infraero.gov.br/aero_prev_home.php?ai=47|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007193123/http://www.infraero.gov.br/aero_prev_home.php?ai=47|url-status=dead|title=Cargo movement in International Airport of Manaus|archive-date=7 October 2009}}</ref> handling the import and export demand from the Manaus [[Free Economic Zone of Manaus|Industrial Complex]]. For this reason, Infraero invested in the construction of the third cargo terminal, opened on December 14, 2004. [[TAM Airlines]] also inaugurated its own cargo terminal near the airport in 2008, which claims to be the largest cargo terminal in Brazil. The country's major dedicated freight route is between Manaus and [[Viracopos International Airport]], which is operated by wide-body jets. Other freight routes include North America and Europe.

The passenger terminal had been fully refurbished and expanded in time for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 FIFA Football World Cup]], which held 4 games in Manaus. The airport currently operates daily international flights to [[Miami]] and [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], United States, by [[American Airlines]] and [[TAM Airlines|LATAM Airlines Brasil]]; to [[Panama City|the city of Panama]], by [[Copa Airlines]]; and to [[Barcelona, Venezuela]], by [[Avior Airlines]]. The airport has direct flights to all major airports in Brazil, operated by the three major carriers: [[Gol Transportes Aéreos]], [[TAM Airlines]], and [[Azul Brazilian Airlines]]. The airport's [[IATA]] code is MAO.

[[Manaus Air Force Base|Manaus Air Force Base - ALA8]], one of the most important bases of the [[Brazilian Air Force]], is located in Manaus at the former [[Ponta Pelada Airport]].

Apart from the Eduardo Gomes International Airport and Ponta Pelada Airport, Manaus is also served by [[Flores Airport (Brazil)|Flores Airport]], used by small propeller aircraft and helicopters about {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=off}} north of the city centre, simply known as the "Aeroclube" ({{langx|pt|Flying club}}). On Sundays, it is used for parachuting and where flying classes can be hired. Due to the fact that it is surrounded by residential areas, and has a recent history of crashes, it is under constant pressure to be moved.

=== Highways ===
[[File:Manaus_avenida.jpg|thumb|Gilberto Mestrinho road complex]]
[[File:Ponte_Rio_Negro_-_Amazonas_-_Brasil.jpg|thumb|[[Rio Negro Bridge]]]]
There are two federal highways that intersect Manaus. There is a paved road heading North (BR-174) connecting Manaus to [[Boa Vista, Roraima|Boa Vista]], the capital of the State of [[Roraima]] and to Venezuela. Strictly speaking, Manaus is connected by road to the rest of Brazil, as it is possible to drive continuously from Manaus into Venezuela, and then reenter Brazil through the [[BR-364]] in [[Acre (state)|Acre]] and its capital, [[Rio Branco, Acre|Rio Branco]], therefore passing through the countries of Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. As such a route is impractical for most motorists, the vast majority of transportation to and from Manaus is by boat or plane, except for journeys to [[Roraima]]. ''[[The Independent]]'' noted that "there are still no roads to Manaus" from the rest of the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/england-v-italy-manaus-in-manic-race-to-be-ready-for-opener-9533539.html |title=England v Italy: Are they painting the Manaus pitch green? |date=12 June 2014 |website=The Independent |access-date=5 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207073730/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/england-v-italy-manaus-in-manic-race-to-be-ready-for-opener-9533539.html |archive-date=7 February 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[BR-319]] heads South connecting Manaus to [[Porto Velho]], the state capital of [[Rondônia]]. However, access to this highway requires a ferry crossing to [[Careiro]], across the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] and [[Amazon River]], which takes about 40 minutes, and then is only paved for about another {{convert|100|km|-1|sp=us}} to Castanho. After that, the highway is not paved, and cannot be used. Various governments have promised to recover this land-link with the rest of the country, but environmental issues, high costs and complicated logistics have impeded any progress so far.

The two major state highways are the AM-010 and the AM-070. The AM-010 heads east, to [[Itacoatiara, Amazonas]] at the banks of the Amazon River, which is the third largest city of the state. The AM-070 heads south, starting on the other side of the new [[Rio Negro Bridge]] at Manaus, and reaching [[Manacapuru]], which lies at the banks of the [[Solimoes River]], also known as the upper River Amazon, and which is the fourth largest city of the state. Both roads are paved and operate all year round.

=== Port ===
{{Main|Port of Manaus}}
[[File:Manaus harbor.jpg|thumb|[[Port of Manaus]]]]
Ships dock at the main port in Manaus directly downtown on the banks of the Negro River. The terraced city is home to a network of bridged channels that divide it into several compartments. Several [[mobile phone]] [[companies]] have manufacturing plants in the port area, and other major [[electronics]] [[manufacture]]rs also have plants there. Major exports going through the port include Brazil nuts, [[chemical]]s, [[petroleum]], electrical equipment, and forest products. {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

=== Taxis ===
Regular Manaus taxis are white and can be stopped anywhere. They are organized into separate cooperatives, each with their own contact phone numbers. All taxis are metered, which does not necessarily mean the meter will be used.

The 'special' taxi cars are typically black and of a higher quality than the white taxis, and will charge a fixed rate for all journeys or daily hire. Most can only be booked locally; however, the reputable Brazil Airport Transfers<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.brazilairporttransfers.com/ |title=Brazil Airport Transfers |access-date=2019-10-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122093300/https://www.brazilairporttransfers.com/ |archive-date=2018-11-22 |url-status=live}}</ref> has recently started providing airport transfer and general transportation services in Manaus.

=== Bus ===
The bus system in Manaus is quite extensive and there are buses and vans that go to most destinations, including the popular tourist destinations. There is a very simple [http://www.onibusmanaus.com.br/ bus website] that permits the planning of routes.
{{wide image|Manaus banner Ponte Rio Negro.jpg|1500|align-cap=center|Panorama of the [[Rio Negro Bridge]], which connects the cities of Manaus and [[Iranduba]]. It is the longest cable-stayed bridge in Brazil, being 3,595 meters (11,794 ft) in length.}}

== Events and holidays ==

The [[annual calendar]] of [[festival]]s in Manaus starts in late February / early March. The Manaus [[carnival]] (carnaval) celebrations are a good start to upcoming events and include traditional processions and samba dancing at the Sambódromo in the Centro de Convenções (Convention Centre). May is a popular time to pay a visit to Manaus, since the city hosts both the Ponta Negra Music and the Amazonas de Opera festivals during this month. Staged at the Teatro Amazonas, the Opera Festival lasts around three weeks and usually runs into early June. The Floclorico do Amazonas (Amazonas Folklore Festival) is in June, and this has grown to become a major event, involving a huge array of [[folk dancing]] and [[music]], culminating in the Procissao Fluvial de São Pedro (St. Peter River Procession), when hundreds of riverboats sail along the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]], honouring the patron saint of fishermen.

October 24 was the day in 1848 that Manaus legally became a city. This [[anniversary]] is always cause for a party, culminating in fireworks at the end of the day. In November is the week-long Amazonas Film Festival, with [[film]]s and [[Documentary|documentaries]] often emphasising [[ecology]], [[ethnology]] and [[human relationship]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.world-guides.com/latin-america/brazil/amazonas/manaus/manaus_events.html |title=Manaus Events and Festivals in 2014 / 2015: Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil |website=www.world-guides.com |access-date=2014-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201215432/http://www.world-guides.com/latin-america/brazil/amazonas/manaus/manaus_events.html |archive-date=2014-02-01 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Because of Manaus' location within the [[Amazon rainforest]], it attracts a substantial number of Brazilian and foreign tourists, who come to see wildlife on land and in the rivers. It is also home to one of the most endangered primates in Brazil, the [[pied tamarin]].

Tour boats leave Manaus to see the Meeting of the Waters, where the black waters of the Negro River meet the brown waters of the Solimoes River, flowing side by side without mixing for about {{cvt|9|km|0}}. Visitors can also explore river banks and "igarapes", swim and [[canoe]] in placid lakes, simply walk in the lush [[forest]] or stay at [[hotel]]s in the jungle.

About {{cvt|18|km|mi}} from downtown is Ponta Negra beach, a neighbourhood that has a beachfront and popular nightlife area.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.maxcohen.photography/ponta-negra-beach-manaus |title=Photos from Ponta Negra Beach - Manaus |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104840/http://www.maxcohen.photography/ponta-negra-beach-manaus |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead}}</ref> A luxurious hotel is located at the west end of Ponta Negra; its [[zoo]] and orchid greenhouse as well as preserved woods and beach are open for public visits.

The [[Mercado Adolpho Lisboa]], founded in 1882, is the city's oldest marketplace, trading in fruit, vegetables, and especially fish. It is a copy of the Les Halles market of Paris.<ref>[http://www.newmediacomm.com/publication/indo-lac/jan_mar10/soccer.html Manaus] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201161427/http://www.newmediacomm.com/publication/indo-lac/jan_mar10/soccer.html |date=2014-02-01 }}</ref> Other interesting historical sites include the [[Customs House, Manaus|customs building]], of mixed styles and medieval inspiration; the Rio Negro Palace cultural center; and the [[Palace of Justice, Manaus|Justice Palace]], right next to the Amazonas Opera House.

Manaus has also many large parks with native forest preservation areas, such as the Bosque da Ciência and Parque do Mindú. The largest urban forest in the world is located within the [[Federal University of Amazonas]], which was founded on January 17, 1909, and is the oldest federal university in Brazil.

Manaus also has several Malls such as Manauara Shopping, Amazonas Shopping Center, Millennium Shopping, Shopping Ponta Negra, Studio 5 Festival Mall, Shopping Cidade Nova, Manaus Plaza Shopping, Shopping Sao José, and other small Shopping Areas. Most of these malls include large food courts and movie theaters.

===Culture===
The city's cultural calendar throughout the year includes the Opera, Theater, Jazz, and Cinema festivals, as well as Boi Manaus (usually held around Manaus' anniversary on the 24th of October), which is a great celebration of Northern Brazilian culture through Boi-Bumbá music.

[[File:Mixing_of_Waters_-_panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|The [[natural]] [[phenomenon]] of the [[confluence]] of the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]]'s water and the [[Solimões River]]'s water]]
{{main|Meeting of Waters}}
The Meeting of Waters ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Encontro das Àguas'') is a natural phenomenon caused by the [[confluence]] of the Rio Negro's dark water and the Solimões River's muddy brown water that come together to form the Amazonas River. For {{cvt|6|km|mi}} or more, both rivers' [[water]]s run side by side without mixing. The reason for this is not clear, although it is likely that the main factors are differences in the speed of the current, the volumes of water and the different densities of the two rivers. It is not thought that other differences between the two rivers (temperature and acidity) affect the mixing process significantly.<ref name="Amazon Handbook">Maguire, T. C., 2012. 'The Amazon Handbook' 2nd Ed., {{ISBN|978-0-9565741-2-1}}</ref> The Negro River flows approximately {{cvt|2|km/h|1}} at {{cvt|28|°C|0}}, while the Solimões River flows {{cvt|4|to|6|km/h|1}} at {{cvt|22|°C|0}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://portalamazonia.globo.com/artigo_amazonia_az.php?idAz=242 |title=Natural phenomenon of confluence |access-date=2009-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304014336/http://portalamazonia.globo.com/artigo_amazonia_az.php?idAz=242 |archive-date=2007-03-04 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== CIGS Zoo ===
The zoo is open to the public. It is managed by the [[Brazilian Army]] and has approximately 300 species of animals from the Amazon [[fauna]].<ref>[http://portalamazonia.globo.com/artigo_amazonia_az.php?idAz=185 Zoo of Manaus] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.today/20081227231606/http://portalamazonia.globo.com/artigo_amazonia_az.php?idAz=185 |date=2008-12-27 }}</ref>

=== Beaches and waterfalls ===
For outings to beaches and parks situated near the city, it is often necessary to use [[boat]]s. The beaches are formed right after the river water level starts dropping, which lasts from August to November. Starting in December, as the river rises, the [[water]]s invade the sand and the woods on the banks. The Paricatuba Waterfall, located on the right bank of the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Negro River]], along a small tributary, is formed by sedimentary rocks, surrounded by abundant vegetation. Access is by boat. The best time to visit is from August to February. Love Cascade located in the Guedes bayou, with cold and crystal clear water, is accessible only by boat and, then, hiking through the forest.

Tupé Beach is approximately {{cvt|34|km|mi}} from Manaus. This [[beach]] is well frequented by bathers on holidays and weekends. It is accessible only by boat. Moon Beach is located on the left bank of the Negro River, {{cvt|23|km|mi}} from Manaus. It is accessed only by boat. The beach is shaped like a crescent moon and is surrounded by [[Rare species|rare]] [[vegetation]]. Lion Waterfall is located on km 34 of the AM-010 highway (Manaus-Itacoatiara).

Manaus was chosen in 2009 to be a host city for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], after a competition to represent the North Region of Brazil with neighboring [[Pará]] state capital, [[Belém, Pará|Belém]].

Manaus was restructured in order to host such a big event. A new airport was built, streets throughout the city were repaved and new and improved sidewalks were built. The communications infrastructure of the city was improved with [[4G]] networks installed by the biggest mobile phone carriers in Brazil.

The [[Vivaldão]], previously the largest stadium in Manaus, was inaugurated in 1970 by the Brazilian national team in their last game in the country before they headed to their victorious [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] in Mexico. It was demolished to be replaced by the 44,000 seater [[Arena Amazônia]] for the 2014 World Cup.<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/destination/cities/city=2037/profile.html Vivaldão Stadium] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121090904/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/destination/cities/city%3D2037/profile.html |date=2014-01-21 }}</ref>
