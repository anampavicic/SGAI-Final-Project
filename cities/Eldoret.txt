'''Eldoret''' is a city in the [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]] region of [[Kenya]]. It serves as the capital of [[Uasin Gishu County]]. Located in western Kenya, and lying south of the [[Cherangani Hills]], the local elevation varies from about {{convert|2100|m|ft}} at the airport to more than {{convert|2700|m|ft}} in nearby areas.

The city was referred to as '''Farm 64''' during the colonial period and is still colloquially referred to by locals as ''''Sisibo'''<nowiki/>'.<ref>{{cite web |title=Eldoret, Kenya |url=https://www.minneapolis.org/about-us/sister-cities/eldoret-kenya/ |website=minneapolis.org}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Eldoret" is based on the [[Maasai language|Maasai]] word "eldore" meaning "stony river"; a reference to the bed of the Sosiani River (a tributary of the [[Nile]]), that runs through the town.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Olengwe |first=Emmanuel |date=2 August 2018 |title=Interesting facts about the origin of Eldoret town |url=https://hivisasa.com/posts/1265-did-you-know-eldoret-is-the-only-town-which-was-not-founded-by-british |access-date=2019-04-23 |website=hivisasa |language=en-gb}}</ref>

==History==
Eldoret and the plateau around it had been occupied by the [[Sirikwa]] for several centuries prior to the era of [[Maasai people|Maasai]] ascendancy.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJ1BZbgF8IEC&q=being+maasai+sirikwa&pg=PA47 |title = Being Maasai: Ethnicity & Identity in East Africa|isbn = 9780821410455|last1 = Spear|first1 = Thomas|last2 = Waller|first2 = Richard D.|year = 1993| publisher=J. Currey }}</ref> Innovation in weaponry was introduced by the Maasai era of the late 18th and 19th centuries. With new weapons and forms of governance, they swept down from their original homelands in the north, closer to [[Lake Turkana]], down to their present homelands south of Kenya. The Maasai clan that took over the Plateau were known as the Ilwasin Kishu, after whom it is presently named.

In August 1908, fifty-eight families of displaced [[Afrikaner]]s left [[Nakuru]] for the Uasin Gishu plateau after a journey from South Africa by sea and by rail from [[Mombasa]]. Led by Jan van Rensburg, they traveled using wagons that would often get stuck in mud, finally arriving at Sergoit Hill [https://twenzetu.com/local/sergoit-hill/]  on 22 October of that year. Jan Ernest Kruger would later own the {{convert|5000|acre|disp=flip}} Sergoit farm, now owned by Sergoit Golf and Wildlife resort.

The land had earlier been surveyed by a certain van Breda and the new arrivals took up leaseholds of between {{convert|800|and|5000|acre|disp=flip}} on condition that they would develop it within five years. Each family built a shack, put up fences, in-spanned oxen to simple ploughs and turned the first furrows. They sowed wheat, maize and vegetables. These actions laid the foundation for the transformation of the Plateau into a prosperous agricultural region.

The farms were later officially registered and each was given a number.<ref>Retief, Ronaldo (2014). Afrikaners trek to East Africa, Old Africa: Stories from East Africa's Past (Issue 55), p. 14-15</ref>

Eldoret was established in the midst of the farms they created on what was known to the settlers as "Farm 64", "64" or "Sisibo" to the locals because at that time it was {{convert|64|mi|disp=flip}} from the newly built [[Uganda Railway]] railhead at [[Londiani]].<ref>Red strangers: the white tribe of Kenya, {{ISBN|1-85725-206-3}}, by Christine Stephanie Nicholls</ref> Willy van Aardt owned the farm. The Central Lounge in Eldoret is all that remains of Willy's farm.

The official town site started in 1910 with the development of a Post Office at "Sisibo". This was followed shortly after by the arrival of 60 more Afrikaner families in 1911.<ref name="ipsos.co.ke">[http://www.ipsos.co.ke/NEWBASE_EXPORTS/ICC/131030_Kass%20Magazine_15_60eef.pdf Kass Magazine] {{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The governor decided to establish an administrative centre in the area in 1912 and thus the Post Office was renamed from "64" to a new official town name: "Eldoret". Becoming an administrative centre caused an enormous increase in trade within the prospective city. A bank and several shops were built.

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM President Jomo Kenyatta staande in een landrover tijdens de opening van de Eldoret Agricultural Show TMnr 20038661.jpg|thumb|Kenya's first president, [[Jomo Kenyatta]], opens the Eldoret Agricultural Show in 1968.]]

The [[Uganda Railway]] extension, from Londiani towards [[Uganda]], reached Eldoret in 1924, starting a new era of prosperity and growth. In 1928, a piped water supply from the Sosiani River was installed and in 1933, an electricity generator plant was installed by the East African Power and Lighting Company. By that time, Eldoret had a small airport, and low-cost rental housing had been constructed.<ref name="ipsos.co.ke"/>

In the 1950s the town was literally divided into two, along the main street (now Uganda Road), with the Afrikaners on the north and the British on the south. The former took their children to Highland School, (now Moi Girls High School)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://moigirlseldoret.ac.ke/|title=Home - Moi Girls High School|website=moigirlseldoret.ac.ke|accessdate=8 May 2024}}</ref> and the latter, to Hill School.<ref>[http://www.mccrow.org.uk/EastAfrica/Hill_School_now/Hill%20School%20Eldoret%20Kenya Hill School. Eldoret Kenya] mccrow.org.uk {{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Recreation was also along the divide – 'Brits' used the Lincoln Hotel and the Race-Course near the now "Chinese Area" while the Afrikaners converged at the Wagon Wheel for recreation.

[[Daniel Arap Moi]] was born in the neighboring Baringo District, and under his [[President of Kenya|presidency]], the town was developed further. The country's second institution of higher learning, [[Moi University]], was established by the government in 1984 and the third international airport was subsequently constructed, significantly boosting the fortunes of the town.

By 1987, only two Afrikaner households remained in Eldoret, with the rest having moved back to South Africa in the late 1950s and early 1960s, in the aftermath of the [[Mau Mau rebellion]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Remnants of Boer Colony Glad They Stayed in Kenya|url=http://articles.philly.com/1987-04-01/news/26193276_1_kenya-white-farms-mau-mau|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731153446/http://articles.philly.com/1987-04-01/news/26193276_1_kenya-white-farms-mau-mau|url-status=dead|archive-date=31 July 2013|access-date=16 September 2013|date=1 April 1987}}</ref> and in anticipation of independence.

The town was significantly impacted by the [[2007–2008 Kenyan crisis]] when violence gripped Kenya in the aftermath of controversial general elections. The athlete [[Lucas Sang]] was murdered about {{convert|10|km|mi}} away from the town while on his way home to Chepkoilel. On 1 January 2008,  a mob attacked and set fire to a church located near [[Burnt Forest]], a satellite town of Eldoret. Hundreds of people had taken refuge during Kenyan massacres. As a result, about forty to eighty people,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/80-children-massacred-in-kenyan-church-767602.html|title=80 children massacred in Kenyan church|date=2 January 2008|website=The Independent}}</ref> mostly [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], were burnt to death.

[[William Ruto]] the current President of the Republic of Kenya was born in Kamagut Ward of [[Turbo Constituency]] that straddles Eldoret town. He has previously represented [[Eldoret North Constituency]] in parliament.

== Climate ==
[[File:Swamp in Outspan, Eldoret.jpg|thumb|A swamp in Eldoret]]
Eldoret has a [[subtropical highland climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''). The town, lying over {{cvt|2000|m|ft}} above sea level, has a moderate to cool climate. The temperature falls significantly at night, and in the cold season (May–August) it is regularly in the single digits Celsius. The warm season is the driest and the cool season is the wettest, making the town have a pattern similar to that of a [[Mediterranean climate]].

==Economy==
[[File:Uasi_ngishu_farmlands.jpg|thumb|Large wheat plantation near Eldoret. Sergoit hill seen in the background]]
Eldoret is surrounded by prime agricultural lands and acts as a trading centre for [[Uasin Gishu County|Uasin Gishu's]] economy which is driven by large-scale grain farming, dairy and horticultural farming. The town is also a local manufacturing hub with a number of nationally recognised manufacturing concerns, including Raiplywoods, Rupa Textiles, Kenya Pipeline Company, Kenya Co-operative Creameries as well as corn, wheat and pyrethrum factories all within the town.<ref name="uasingishu.go.ke">{{cite web |url=http://uasingishu.go.ke/reports/8/about-the-county |title=Uasin Gishu County - Article Profile - About the County |access-date=2015-04-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414072350/http://www.uasingishu.go.ke/reports/8/about-the-county |archive-date=14 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The city is home to a large [[market (place)|market]] and is known for the ''Doinyo Lessos'' cheese factory, [[Moi University]] and [[Eldoret International Airport]]. The runners from Eldoret have also contributed significantly to the economy of Eldoret town, primarily investing in small businesses and real estate, from their winnings in races all over the world. [[Moses Kiptanui]] is a stake holder in one of the largest buildings, Komora, that houses a large supermarket chain and many offices.
 
Notable professional firms include Nyairo and Company, the oldest law firm in the town`, founded by Alfred Momanyi Nyairo in the sixties. Other law firms include Wabomba Masinde and Associates advocates, Gumbo and Associate Advocates, Mburu Maina & Company Advocates, Nyaundi Tuiyott & Company Advocates, Kalya & Company Advocates, Chebii and Company Advocates and Gicheru & Company Advocates.

===Industries===
====Textiles====
The city has an industry that is led by Ken Knit (Kenya). It is the first, fully integrated textile manufacturing company in East and Central Africa and has been based in Eldoret for close to 50 years. It is Kenya's leading manufacturer of wool products and with a workforce of 2,000, is presently the largest textile related employer in the North-Rift.<ref>{{cite web |title=About Us |url=http://www.kenknit.com/about-us.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200808224635/https://kenknit.com/about-us.html |archive-date=8 August 2020 |website=kenknit.com}}</ref>

Another notable textile firm is Rivatex EA which was opened in 1975 by then Vice President, [[Daniel Toroitich arap Moi]] as Rift Valley Textiles ([[Rivatex]]), a [[parastatal]] that was the first Kenyan textile mill to operate computerized mills. It quickly became a success, achieving profitability within three years while employing 400 people and consuming 3,000 tons of cotton a year at its peak. By the late 1990s, the liberalization of Kenya's market which led to massive imports of cheap used clothing coupled with mismanagement led to the decline of the country's textile industry.

The city of Eldoret, through Moi University and its subsidiary firm Rivatex, has played a leading role in the revival of the Kenyan textile industry.<ref name="theeastafrican.co.ke"/><ref name="ruc.mu.ac.ke">Kibet, D., ''[https://ruc.mu.ac.ke/new-dye-made-from-weed-revives-kenyas-textile-industry-and-brings-local-fabric-costs-down/ New dye made from weed revives Kenya’s textile industry and brings local fabric costs down] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024154002/https://ruc.mu.ac.ke/new-dye-made-from-weed-revives-kenyas-textile-industry-and-brings-local-fabric-costs-down/ |date=24 October 2016 }}'', Moi University Research Uptake 18 May 2015</ref>

The defunct Rivatex was purchased from the Government of Kenya in 2007 by Moi University as a facility for research, product development, extension and production. The university identified the high cost of imported dyes as a factor affecting profitability. This was resolved in 2008, when [[Richard Mibey|Prof Richard Mibey]], invented the Tami Dye, a natural dye made from Mexican Marigold which was previously considered a weed in the surrounding regions. The university holds the patent to this dye.<ref name="theeastafrican.co.ke"/>

Being able to produce affordable dye in Kenya has been a key contributing factor to the revival of Rivatex East Africa and the wider Kenyan textile industry.<ref name="ruc.mu.ac.ke"/> The university won a $60 million grant from the World Bank to carry out a face-lift as a result of the work on the Tami Dye. It also secured a pledged investment of $40 million from the Indian Government.<ref name="theeastafrican.co.ke"/>

====Roads====
[[File:Vehicles leaving Eldoret town, Kenya.jpg|thumb|Vehicles leaving Eldoret, near Sosiani primary school.]]
The Trans-African highway passes through the town's central business district.

====Railway====
The town is also served by the Kenya-Uganda railway.Construction began in 1920, reaching Eldoret in 1924 and winding up at Kampala in 1930. This extension put Eldoret town itself 64 miles away from the railhead, an occurrence that birthed the town’s famous moniker of Farm 64 which morphed into Sisibo through vernacular influence. Construction of the Eldoret line paved the way for the extension of other branch lines into areas of high European settlement such as Kitale, Nyahururu, and Nanyuki. Railway presence in these towns created a reliable means of transporting farm produce, thus leading to their growth and development as the colony’s bread baskets.  

====Power====
The French renewable energy firm Voltalia is building a 40-megawatt (MW) solar plant for compatriot Kenya-based French solar firm Alten Africa in Kesses, Eldoret. Once it goes into commercial operation, scheduled for March 2020, approximately 123.6GWh of clean electricity will be injected into the grid every year, enough to meet the annual energy consumption needs of over 824,000 Kenyans.<ref>French firm to build 40MW solar plant in Eldoret, Business Daily [https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/markets/marketnews/French-firm-to-build-40MW-solar-plant/3815534-4923146-5l2eje/index.html online]</ref>
