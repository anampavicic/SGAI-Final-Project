The city is under the jurisdiction of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Antipolo]]. It contains the [[Our Lady of the Abandoned Parish Church (Marikina)|Our Lady of the Abandoned Church]], the oldest in the Marikina Valley, built in 1572.

==Etymology==
In view of the non-existence of records or documents on how the name Marikina came into being, the following legends were gathered from elder residents of the different [[barrio]]s in Marikina.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://marikina.gov.ph/webmarikina/Our-City.html | title=Marikina City - Shoe Capital of the Philippines | access-date=April 5, 2022 | archive-date=December 11, 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211211131149/https://marikina.gov.ph/webmarikina/Our-City.html | url-status=dead }}</ref>
*One of the builders of the [[Jesus dela Pena Chapel|Jesús de la Peña Chapel]] was a young priest named "Mariquina", who was given the task of baptizing children to Christianity. Because of this very noble job, ''Mariquina'' was named in his honor.
*It is said that before the [[Spaniards]] came to Mariquina, a beautiful, virtuous, polite, and intelligent lady named ''Maria Cuina'' was residing in the town. Because of her expertise in business, she became wealthy, and her fortunes were expended on charity. She eventually became famous in the whole town up to Manila.
*Construction of the chapel of Jesús de la Peña was supervised by a [[Jesuit]] priest, and the laborers were Filipinos. As expected, the language barrier resulted in the usual misunderstandings. When the chapel was completed and the priest asked what the structure would be called, one worker answered "Marikit-na-Po", thinking that what was being asked was the condition of the chapel.
*In the province of [[Bizkaia|Viscaya]] in [[Spain]], there was a beautiful town called ''[[Markina-Xemein|Mariquina]]''. The town, located beside the Charmaga River (now known as [[Lea-Artibai|Artibai]] River), is the origin of the Jesuit priests who came to the Philippines and established Jesús de la Peña. Because of this, "Mariquina" was used to honor the place where they came from. In 1901, Commissioner de Tavera changed the letter "q" to "k".
*Based on history and documents in the custody of the municipal government of Marikina, the town was called Marikit-na in 1787 and was later changed to Mariquina. According to [[Trinidad Pardo de Tavera|Dr. Trinidad Pardo de Tavera]], the word ''Mariquina'' was in recognition of [[Félix Berenguer de Marquina|Capt. Berenguer de Marquina]] who led the town in 1788.

==History==
===Spanish Colonial Era===
[[File:Dela pena.jpg|thumbnail|left|175px|[[Jesus dela Pena Chapel|Jesús de la Pena Chapel]]]]
According to a local historian named Servando de los Angeles, the first settlers of Marikina are the descendants of Lakan Dula, known as the head of the ruling House of Dula and the pre-hispanic king of the Lakanate of  Tondo. It happened when Lakan Dula sent his descendants to far away lands within sea and river routes. The riverbanks of Marikina were then settled by river dwellers or "taga-ilog", these natives were discovered by the Augustinians as they explored along the riverbanks during 1570's. Then during 1630's Jesuits arrived and there is when Christianity spread in Marikina, since the Jesuits have had the ecclesiastical control and supervision over the land.The [[Augustinians]] first to arrived at the valley in the late 16th century, at the spot known as Chorillo in [[Barangka (Marikina)|Barangka]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://pia.gov.ph/features/articles/1015236 | title=Features | website=Philippine Information Agency }}</ref> In 1572, [[Our Lady of the Abandoned Parish]] was established. Next came the [[Jesuits]] in 1630, in a place now called Jesús de la Peña (Jesus of the Rocks). Here, the Jesuits established a mission and built a chapel still known today as [[Jesus dela Pena Chapel|Jesús de la Pena Chapel]]. Fray Pedro de Arce, apostolic ruler of the [[Archbishop of Manila]] at that time, approved transfer of ecclesiastical control and supervision to the [[Jesuits]], and settled the place as a [[town]].<ref name="marikina1">{{cite web |url=http://marikina.gov.ph/#!/history |title= Marikina History|website=marikina.gov.ph |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040618193907/http://marikina.gov.ph/#!/history |archive-date=June 18, 2004}}</ref>

In [[List of earthquakes in the Philippines#17th century|1665]], an intensity 8 earthquake struck the valley and nearby Manila, and it is related to the activity now known as [[Marikina Valley Fault System]]. Only a Jesuit church experienced great damage and resulting in 19 deaths in the said earthquake.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/18556/18556-h/18556-h.htm |title= Gutenberg|date=June 11, 2006}}</ref>

[[File:Felix_Berenguer.jpg|thumbnail|left|175px|[[Félix Berenguer de Marquina]]]]
In 1787, the town was called "Mariquina" after [[Felix Berenguer de Marquina]], who was the [[Governor-General of the Philippines|governor-general]] at that time, and the town was declared a [[pueblo]] under the [[Spanish Colonial Era (Philippines)|Spanish colonial government]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://davidmerinfinals.wordpress.com/2013/12/09/history-of-marikina/|title = History of Marikina|date = December 9, 2013}}</ref>

Marikina was once the Hacienda Sauza-Berenguer de Marquina (1809–1870), the land and home was formerly owned by Don Santiago Sauza y Delos Rios (1777–1880) and his wife Dona Ysabel Berenguer de Marquina y Sumulong (1790–1900). Moreover, Doña Ysabel Berenguer de Marquina y Sumulong (November 19, 1790, Cagsawa, Daraga,  Albay, Philippines – January 30, 1900, Banwa, Batan, Aklan, Philippines) was the only daughter of Doña Demetria Sumulong y Lindo and of Señor Felix Berenguer de Marquina y FitzGerald, the former Governor-General of the Philippines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Isabel-Berenguer-de-Marquina/6000000031175495318|title = Isabel Berenguer de Marquina|website=Geni|date = April 28, 2022}}</ref> By the 19th century, [[Hacienda]] Mariquina was eventually owned and administered by the Tuason family and had become the largest in the Philippines. The hacienda was declared a [[mayorazgo]] by the Spanish colonial government. Don Juan Gregorio became the first [[Alcalde|Alcalde Capitan]] of Mariquina in 1822.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mvhlc.wordpress.com/about-marikina-city/|title = About Marikina City|website=Lions Club of Marikina|date = April 24, 2024}}</ref>

During the [[Philippine Revolution]] in 1896, [[Andrés Bonifacio]] arrived in Mariquina before he and his [[Katipuneros]] proceeded to the caves of [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Montalban]]. Mariquina became the capital of the [[Manila (province)|Province of Manila]] in 1898, when the [[Philippine Revolution]] broke out, a period when Philippine [[Independence]] was declared by [[Emilio Aguinaldo]], the first Philippine [[President (government title)|president]]. Don Vicente Gomez became the first [[Alcalde-Presidente|Alcalde Presidente]] of Mariquina in 1900.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://steemit.com/history/@aemie/marikina-river#:~:text=Don%20Vicente%20Gomez%20became%20the%20first%20Alcalde%20Presidente%20of%20Mariquina%20in%201900.&text=On%20June%2011%2C%201901%2C%20shortly,by%20virtue%20of%20Act%20No.|title = Marikina River|website=Steemit|date = January 22, 2018}}</ref>

===American Colonial Era===
On June 11, 1901, shortly after the United States took possession of the Philippines, its name officially became "Marikina". The province of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]] was created by virtue of Act No. 137 by the [[First Philippine Commission]] which was acting as the [[Legislative body|unicameral legislative body]] in the island of [[Luzon]]. Marikina, along with many other towns around [[Manila]], was incorporated into the new province.

In 1906, the [[Philippine National Railway|Manila Railroad Company]] completed a {{convert|31|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} steam train line called "Montalban Line", also known as Marikina Line and Rosario-Montalban branch, a branch of [[Philippine National Railway]] in which the train company is currently existing<ref>[[List of Philippine National Railways stations#Rosario-Montalban branch]]</ref> (today, it converted into a road which is known today as Daang Bakal, including Shoe Avenue and other streets following the former old tracks of the line). The company also constructed three stations in Marikina, connecting between Montalban (known today as [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Rodriguez]], in Rizal Province) and Rosario (known today as Tramo, in [[Pasig]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://d0ctrine.com/2011/11/08/railways-of-old-in-manila-and-rizal/|title=Railways of old in Manila and Rizal &#124; Caught (up) in traffic|publisher=D0ctrine.com|date=November 8, 2011|access-date=March 13, 2014}}</ref> Marikina Bridge, a vital economic link to Manila, was formally opened in 1934.

===Japanese Occupation Era===
In 1942, during the [[World War II]], [[Japanese Imperial]] forces occupied Marikina. The town was liberated in 1945 by combined United States and [[Philippine Commonwealth]] ground troops, who attacked the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] by artillery from [[Quezon City]]. Almost all of the large buildings, including the church bell tower, were destroyed. In reality, the Japanese had already left the town and retreated to the north.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}} The town saw over 400 civilians casualties by the end of World War II. Local Filipino troops under the pre-war 4th and 42nd Infantry Division of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] entered Marikina and assisted U.S. forces in attacking Japanese troops during the liberation. The general headquarters of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] was rebuilt and stationed in Marikina after the war.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

===Philippine Independence===
In 1956, Marikina was given the title of "Shoe Capital of the Philippines", has re-emerged as a town of [[shoemakers]] after World War II. Honed by years of shoe manufacturing experience, the natives had developed a work ethic that prepared them for the arrival of heavy industries. With the industrial plants came waves of workers who chose to stay, rapidly increasing the population.

In November 1959, [[Osmundo de Guzman]] was [[1959 Marikina local elections|elected mayor]] of Marikina.<ref>{{cite news|title=Guzman elected Marikina mayor|work=[[The Manila Times]]|publisher=The Manila Times Publishing Company, Inc.|date=November 13, 1959|quote=De Guzman, a political neophyte who ran as a [[Grand Alliance (Philippines)|Grand Alliance]] candidate, defeated four more seasoned political rivals, including Mayor Gil Fernando.}}</ref>

In 1968, [[Kapitan Moy Residence|Kapitan Moy's house]] (now known as Sentrong Pangkultura ng Marikina) was declared a national shrine by the town council and the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines|National Historical Commission]]. In 1969, Rodriguez Sports Complex, known today as [[Marikina Sports Complex|Marikina Sports Center]] was completed.

On November 7, 1975, by virtue of ''[[Presidential Decree]] No. 824'', four cities and twelve towns of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]], including Marikina, along with the town of [[Valenzuela, Metro Manila|Valenzuela]] in [[Bulacan]], were made part of [[Metropolitan Manila]] Area.<ref>{{cite PH act |title=Creating the Metropolitan Manila and the Metropolitan Manila Commission and for other purposes |chamber=PD |number=824 |date=November 7, 1975 |url=https://lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1975/pd_824_1975.html |access-date=October 2, 2023}}</ref>

Meanwhile, a delay of counting of ballots due to lack of [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] personnel led to some 200 teachers abandoning their posts, taking with them canvassing sheets and less than 16,000 unvalidated ballots. The counting proceeded with some employees of the local government treasury assisted in validation of votes.

It is approximately {{convert|21|km|sp=us}} away from [[Manila]] and lies within {{coord|14|38|24|N|121|5|50|E|type:city(150000)_region:TH-30|display=inline}}.

[[File:Parc Cruz.jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|[[Marikina River]]]]
From the north, Marikina occupies the south bank of the Nangka River, parts of Barangay Nangka and Barangay Fortune. The east slices at the foot of the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] mountains of [[Antipolo]] where the Meteor Homes Subdivision and Empress Subdivision are located. It continues south and occupies La Milagrosa Village in Barangay Marikina Heights and Rancho Estates 2 and 3 in Barangay Concepcion Dos. The southeast slices by Quiling Malaki Creek (where the [[Sapang Baho Creek|Sapang Baho River]] originated) and occupies the north bank where the Barangay Conception Dos is located. It continues south and meets Balanti Creek which occupies the west bank, parts of Barangay Santo Niño and Barangay Santa Elena. From the southeastmost, it occupies Marikina Midtown Subdivision in Barangay San Roque. The south portion is sliced by [[Marikina-Infanta Highway]] occupies the north side of the highway and [[Marikina–Pasig station|LRT-2 Marikina–Pasig station]], and extends to the west until it occupies the [[Santolan station|LRT-2 Santolan station]] and reaches the Marikina River in Barangay Calumpang, near BFCT East Metro Terminal. The east occupies the southernmost of Quezon City hills which lies Barangay Industrial Valley and sliced by C5 Road occupies the west side until it reaches the Ateneo de Manila University campus. The east side of the campus covers the city, lies in Barangay Barangka, extending to the north and sliced by several roads of Loyola Grand Villas and Barangay Tumana, which covers the east part of the village until it reaches Marikina River and its tributary Nangka River in the northernmost point.

[[Marikina River]] runs to the western part of the city and is surrounded by many lush trees in the [[Marikina River Park]] on the riverbanks. The south portion of the river is surrounded by structures and concrete walkways. The river covers an area of around {{convert|220|ha|sp=us}} and measures about {{convert|11|km|sp=us}} in length and is the principal drainage system for Marikina. Its depth measures from 12 meters up to 18 meters during the heavy downpour. Rehabilitation of the River started in 1992. The river traverses 11 city barangays which have streets and alleys going to the river, making river parks easily accessible. River parks today are popular sports and recreational centers not only in Metro Manila but throughout the Philippines.

Marikina is also prone to various natural disasters, including the major floodings during the onslaught of [[Typhoon Ruby (1988)|Typhoon Unsang]] in 1988, [[Typhoon Ketsana|Typhoon Ondoy]] in 2009, [[Tropical Storm Meari (2011)|Tropical Storm Falcon]] and [[Typhoon Nesat (2011)|Typhoon Pedring]] in 2011, seasonal [[southwest monsoon]] in [[2012 Philippines flooding|2012]] and [[2016 Philippine southwest monsoon floods|2016]], and [[Typhoon Vamco|Typhoon Ulysses]] in 2020. Primarily, flooding within Marikina is caused by the increase of water level in major rivers and its tributaries from the Sierra Madre mountains, followed by overflowing from its riverbanks to low-lying areas throughout the city.

Another major threat is [[Fault (geology)|fault lines]] in Marikina caused by [[earthquakes]]. [[Marikina Valley Fault System|West Valley Fault Line]], previously known as Marikina Fault Line, lies at the west Marikina.
