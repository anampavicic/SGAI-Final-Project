'''Hualien County''' ([[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]] [[Wade–Giles]]: Hua¹-lien² Hsien⁴; [[Hànyǔ Pīnyīn|Pīnyīn]]: ''Huālián Xiàn''; [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Hokkien]] [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī|POJ]]: ''Hoa-lian-koān'' or ''Hoa-liân-koān''; [[Taiwanese Hakka|Hakka]] [[Pha̍k-fa-sṳ|PFS]]: ''Fâ-lièn-yen''; [[Amis language|Amis]]: ''Kalingko'') is a [[County (Taiwan)|county]] on the east coast of [[Taiwan]]. It is Taiwan's largest county by area, yet due to its mountainous [[terrain]], has one of the lowest populations in the country. The county seat and largest city is [[Hualien City]]. Hualien County is located in the eastern part of Taiwan—the [[Pacific Ocean]] lies to its east and the [[Central Mountain Range]] lies to its west. Narrow and long, Hualien is the largest [[counties of Taiwan|county in Taiwan]] in terms of area.

Most of its population resides in the [[Huadong Valley]], which runs north to south between the [[Central Mountain Range|Central]] and [[Hai'an Range|Hai'an]] mountain ranges. Hualien's natural environment attracts many visitors and some of its natural attractions include [[Taroko National Park|Taroko Gorge]], [[Qingshui Cliff]], and [[Qixingtan Beach]].{{fact|date=September 2024}}

Much of modern-day Hualien County was populated by the [[Sakizaya people]] before the arrival of the [[Spanish Formosa|Spanish]], [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch]], and [[Han Chinese]] under [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Qing]] annexation. The region was renamed [[Karenkō Prefecture]] in 1895 during [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial rule]]. In 1945, after the end of World War II, the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] took control of Taiwan and renamed the former Karenkō Prefecture as Hualien County of [[Taiwan Province]]. Taiwan Province would be reorganized once again in 1998 and Hualien County fell under the direct jurisdiction of the [[Executive Yuan]].

As of February 2023, Hualien's organic cultivation area was {{convert|3175|ha|acre}}, the largest of any county in the country. Hualien is the largest [[Organic farming|organic agricultural]] production base in Taiwan.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2013-05-14 |title=國內有機及友善耕作種植面積概況 |url=https://www.afa.gov.tw/cht/%7Bshare:url%7D |access-date=2023-03-25 |website=www.afa.gov.tw |language=zh-Hant-TW }}{{Dead link|date=August 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==History==
===Early history===
Modern-day Hualien City was originally called ''Kilai'' ({{zh|c=奇萊|poj=Kî-lâi}}), after the [[Sakizaya people|Sakizaya]] [[Taiwanese aborigines|Taiwanese indigenous peoples]]' settlement.<ref>{{Cite web |script-title=zh:撒奇萊雅族 |url=http://www.tacp.gov.tw/home02_3.aspx?ID=$3131&IDK=2&EXEC=L |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511131535/http://www.tacp.gov.tw/home02_3.aspx?ID=%243131&IDK=2&EXEC=L |archive-date=11 May 2015 |access-date=3 December 2014 |website=Taiwan Indigenous Peoples Culture Park |language=zh}}</ref>

Spanish settlers arrived in 1622 to pan for gold. Picking up the sounds of native words, these settlers called the area ''Turumoan'' ({{zh|t=多羅滿|poj=To-lô-boán|labels=no}}). [[Han Chinese]] settlers arrived in 1851. [[Qing dynasty]] records give the name of the region as ''Huilan'' ({{zh|t=洄瀾|poj=Hoê-liân|l=eddies|labels=no}}) due to the whirling of waters in the [[River delta|delta]].

===Empire of Japan===
{{main|Karenkō Prefecture}}
During Taiwan's [[Japanese Occupation of Taiwan|Japanese colonial period]] (1895–1945) the island's Japanese governors opted not to [[transliteration|transliterate]] the name "Kiray" because the Japanese pronunciation of the word resembled the Japanese word for {{nihongo|"dislike, disgusting"|嫌い|kirai}}. The official name became {{nihongo|Karenkō|花蓮港|Karenkō}}. Karenkō Prefecture consisted of modern-day Hualien County. Toward the end of World War II the [[Governor-General of Taiwan]] moved many Japanese residents of Taiwan to the area to develop agriculture. The county was named after lotus flowers.

===Republic of China===
After the [[Retrocession Day|handover of Taiwan from Japan]] to the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in October 1945, Hualien was established as a [[County (Taiwan)|county]] named '''Hualien County''' of [[Taiwan Province]] on 9 January 1946. In 1951, Hualien was the first county in Taiwan to be governed according to the ROC local autonomy law. Today the Hualien area serves as the key population center on the east coast it is one of the five main 'life circle' regions in Taiwan, together with [[Taipei]], [[Taichung]], [[Tainan]] and [[Kaohsiung]].

=== 2021 train derailment ===
On 2 April 2021, a [[Taroko Express]] [[Hualien train derailment|derailed]] at the north entrance of Qingshui Tunnel after striking an unattended [[flatbed truck]] that had fallen onto the tracks. The incident is the deadliest train accident in Taiwan since 1948, with at least 50 passengers reported dead and more than 150 injured.

==Geography==
[[File:Taiwan 2009 HuaLien City Roadside Cemetery FRD 8181.jpg|thumb|[[Central Mountain Range]]]]
[[File:Txu-oclc-6557994-index-453.jpg|left|thumb|Hualien (1951)]]
Hualien County is situated in eastern Taiwan. It faces the [[Pacific Ocean]] with [[Japan]] ([[Okinawa Prefecture]]) lying to its east, the [[Central Mountain Range]], [[Taichung City]], [[Nantou County]], and [[Kaohsiung City]] to its west, [[Yilan County, Taiwan|Yilan County]] to the north, and [[Taitung County]] to the south. It stretches around {{convert|137.5|km|abbr=on}} from north to south, with its east-west width ranging from {{convert|27|to|43|km|abbr=on}}. Its area is about {{convert|4628.57|km2|abbr=on}}, approximately an eighth of Taiwan's total area.

Despite its vast area, only 7% of the county area is populated. The remaining area is occupied by rivers (7%) and mountains (87%). Prominent mountain ranges include the [[Central Mountain Range]] in the west and the [[Hai'an Range]] in the east. The main rivers in the county include the [[Hualian River]] and [[Xiuguluan River]] and their branches. Subtropical plains, with a mean width around {{convert|3|-|6|km|abbr=on}}, dominate the valleys between both mountain ranges. Due to the inhospitable nature of the surrounding mountainous terrain, Hualien people reside mostly on the [[alluvial fan]]s of the [[Huatung Valley]] plains.<ref>{{Cite web |script-title=zh:縣府各樓層平面圖 |url=http://www.hl.gov.tw/files/11-1001-353.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180723064010/https://www.hl.gov.tw/files/11-1001-353.php |archive-date=2018-07-23 |access-date=2014-08-27 |language=zh |script-website=zh:花蓮縣全球資訊服務網}}</ref>

===Administrative divisions===
Hualien County is divided into one [[County-administered city|city]], two [[Township (Taiwan)|urban townships]], seven [[Township (Taiwan)|rural townships]], and three [[Township (Taiwan)|mountain indigenous townships]]. Some towns have Japanese names because these towns were named by Japanese during the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese ruling period]] from 1895 to 1945. [[Hualien City]] is the county seat and houses the [[Hualien County Government]] and [[Hualien County Council]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Yang |first=Yi-chung |last2=Chung |first2=Jake |date=2 September 2014 |title=Interview: Hualien Commissioner Fu Targets Debt |work=Taipei Times |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/09/02/2003598834 |url-status=live |access-date=2014-09-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908034557/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/09/02/2003598834 |archive-date=2014-09-08}}</ref>

===Population===
Hualien County has 318,995 inhabitants as of January 2023 and is divided into 1 [[county-administered city|city]] and 12 [[Township (Taiwan)|townships]]. Its late development means that many aboriginal cultures such as [[Amis people|Amis]], [[Atayal people|Atayal]], [[Bunun people|Bunun]], [[Truku people|Truku]], [[Sakizaya people|Sakizaya]], and [[Kavalan people|Kavalan]] are well-preserved. As of 2014, aborigines make up 27.5% of the population of Hualien County (about 91,675).<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hsieh |first=Chia-chen |last2=Wu |first2=Jeffrey |date=15 February 2015 |title=Amis Remains Taiwan's Biggest Aboriginal Tribe at 37.1% of Total |work=Focus Taiwan News Channel |agency=Central News Agency |url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201502150011.aspx |access-date=2015-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216122029/http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201502150011.aspx |archive-date=2015-02-16}}</ref> The [[Hakka people]] comprise about 30% of inhabitants.<ref name="taipeitimes.com" />

The county has seen negative population growth since the early 2000s due to emigration to other places outside Hualien County, with an average reduction of 1,393 people per year over the past 18 years.
