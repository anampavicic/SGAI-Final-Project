'''Bhuj''' ({{pronunciation|Bhuj.ogg}}) is a city and the headquarters of [[Kutch district]] in the [[Indian state]] of [[Gujarat]].

==Etymology==
According to legend, Kutch (Kachchh) was ruled by the [[Nāga]] chieftains in the past. Sagai, a queen of Sheshapattana, who was married to King Bheria Kumar, rose up against Bhujanga, the last chieftain of Naga. After the battle, Bheria was defeated and Queen Sagai committed [[Sati (practice)|sati]]. The hill where they lived later came to be known as [[Bhujia Hill]] and the town at the foothill as Bhuj. Bhujang was later worshiped by the people as snake god, ''[[Nāga|Bhujanga]]'', and a temple was constructed to revere him.<ref name="Ward1998">{{cite book|author=Ward|title=Gujarat–Daman–Diu: A Travel Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P7EHTBl_pyQC&pg=PA316|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Orient Longman Limited|isbn=978-81-250-1383-9|pages=316–317}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Jadeja Chief.JPG|320x240px|thumbnail|left|A Jadeja Chief in Kutchi attire during reign of Deshalji II : A sketch drawn in 1838]]
Bhuj was founded by Rao Hamir in 1510 and was made the capital of [[Kutch]] (kachchh) by Rao [[Khengarji I]] in 1549.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhujonline.in/city-guide/bhuj-history|title=History of Bhuj|publisher=Bhuj Online|access-date=31 October 2018 }}</ref> Its foundation stone as state capital was formally laid on [[Vikram Samvat]] 1604 [[Maagha]] 5th (approx. 25 January 1548). From 1590 onwards, when Rao was forced to acknowledge the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal supremacy]], Bhuj came to be known as Suleiman Nagar amongst Muslims. The city's walls were built by Rao [[Godji I]] in 1723{{dubious|date=October 2015}}, and the Bhujia Fort by Devkaran Seth in Rao [[Deshalji I]]'s time (1718 - 1741).<ref name=dgg>{{cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dLUBAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA210|year=1880|publisher=Printed at the Government Central Press|pages=215–216}}</ref>

Bhuj has been attacked six times. In two instances, the defense was successful and in four other instances, the defense failed. In 1728, an attack by Sarbuland Khan, Mughal Viceroy of Gujarat, was repulsed by Rao [[Deshalji I]], and, in 1765 [[Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro]] was, by a timely display of the strength of the fortifications, induced to withdraw. During the civil troubles of the reign of the Rao [[Rayadhan III]], Bhuj was thrice taken, by Meghji Seth in 1786, by Hansraj in 1801, and by [[Fateh Muhammad]] in 1808. On 26 March 1819, the hill fort of Bhujia was captured by a British detachment under Sir William Keir.<ref name=dgg/>

In 1818, Bhuj had a population of 20,000 people. The [[1819 Rann of Kutch earthquake|earthquake on 16 June 1819]] destroyed nearly 7000 houses with a loss of an estimated 1140 human lives. About one-third of the buildings that escaped ruin were heavily damaged, and the north face of the town wall was leveled with the ground.

The British garrison at Bhuj peaked in 1826 with nearly 1400 British troops (685 infantry, 543 dragoons, 90 foot artillery and 74 horse artillery)<ref>''Sikunder Burnes'', by [[Craig Murray]], p36</ref> supported by over 5000 Indian soldiers. Amongst the highest profile British figures during this time was [[Alexander Burnes]] who was based here between 1826 and 1829.

In 1837, Bhuj is said to have had a population of 30,000, including 6,000 Muslims.<ref name=dgg/>

After independence of India in 1947, [[Kutch State]] acceded unto the [[dominion of India]] and was constituted an independent [[commissionaire]], [[Kutch State]]. In 1956, Kutch State was merged with [[Bombay state]], which in 1960 was divided into the new linguistic states of [[Gujarat]] and [[Maharashtra]], with Kutch becoming part of Gujarat state as Kutch district. Bhuj is the district headquarters of [[Kutch District]], the largest district in India.

On [[1956 Anjar earthquake|21 July 1956]]<ref name=h>{{cite news|title=Quake rocks Kutch|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/07/24/stories/2006072400940900.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824132322/http://www.hindu.com/2006/07/24/stories/2006072400940900.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 August 2011|access-date=16 December 2013|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=24 July 1956}}</ref> as well as on [[2001 Gujarat earthquake|26 January 2001]], the city suffered great losses of life and property due to earthquakes. Many parts of Bhuj were demolished due to the extensive damage, whilst others were repaired. There has been great progress in rebuilding the City since the 2001 earthquake, with considerable improvements to roads, transportation, and infrastructure.

Bhuj is home to one of the first [[Swaminarayan Sampraday]] temples, built in 1822. Bhuj temple is one of the six original temples built during the earthly presence of the Lord Swaminarayan. The devotees living in Bhuj including Gangaram Mull, Sundarji Suthar and Hirji Suthar requested Lord to construct a temple at Bhuj. Lord instructed Vaishnavanand Swami to construct the temple, and Lord himself installed the murti of Lord NarNarayan Dev in Bhuj on VS 1879 on the 5th day of the bright half of the month of Vaishakh (Friday 15 May 1823 AD).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bhujmandir.org |title = Swaminarayan.faith - Home of Shree Swaminarayan Bhagwan}}</ref>

==Geography==
Bhuj has an average elevation of 110&nbsp;metres (360&nbsp;feet). On the eastern side of the city is a hill known as [[Bhujia Hill]], on which there is a [[Bhujia Fort]], that separates Bhuj city and [[Madhapar]] town ( considered one of the richest villages in Asia ). It has two lakes namely [[Hamirsar Lake]] and Deshadsar (દેેેશળસર).

{{Wide image|Bhuj skyline from Bhujia Fort on Bhujia Hill Bhuj Kutch Gujarat.jpg|2400px|Skyline of Bhuj from [[Bhujia Fort]] atop [[Bhujia Hill]]}}

==Climate==
Bhuj has a [[semi-desert climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-desert climate]] (''BSh''). Although annual rainfall "averages" around {{convert|400|mm|in|0|disp=or}} the variability is among the highest in the world with [[coefficient of variation]] of around sixty per cent<ref>Van Etten, Eddie J.B.; 'Inter-annual Rainfall Variability of Arid Australia: greater than elsewhere?'; ''[[Australian Geographer]]''; 40 (2009), pp. 109-120</ref> – among the few comparably variable climates in the world being the [[Line Islands]] of Kiribati, the [[Pilbara]] coast of Western Australia, the [[sertão]] of Northeastern Brazil, and the [[Cape Verde]] islands.<ref>Dewar, Robert E. and Wallis, James R; 'Geographical patterning of interannual rainfall variability in the tropics and near tropics: An L-moments approach'; in ''[[Journal of Climate]]'', 12; pp. 3457-3466</ref> Recorded annual rainfall has been as low as {{convert|21.9|mm|in|2|disp=or}} in 1899 – yet in 1926 a total of {{convert|1177.1|mm|in|2|disp=or}} fell and in the incomplete year of 1959 rainfall exceeded {{convert|1160|mm|in|2|disp=or}}, of which {{convert|730.6|mm|in|2|disp=or}} fell during Bhuj's wettest-ever month of July 1959.

Apart from the cool mornings of the "winter" season from December to February, temperatures are very warm to sweltering throughout the year, which further reduces the effectiveness of the erratic [[Monsoon of South Asia|monsoonal]] rainfall. During the "hot" season from mid-March to mid-June, temperatures of {{convert|40|C|F|disp=or}} are frequent, whilst during the monsoon season they exceed {{convert|34|C|F|1|disp=or}} with high humidity except during rainy spells accompanied by cooler temperatures but oppressive humidity.
