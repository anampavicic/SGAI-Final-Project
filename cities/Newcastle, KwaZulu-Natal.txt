'''Newcastle''' is the third-largest city in the province of [[KwaZulu-Natal]], [[South Africa]] and is the province's industrial centre. The city has four industrial areas. The majority of its citizens reside in Newcastle East in the main townships of [[Madadeni]] and [[Osizweni]], with the balance residing in Newcastle West (the two sides of Newcastle are separated by the [[N11 (South Africa)|N11 road]]).{{Cn|date=October 2024}} Set at the foothills of the northern KwaZulu-Natal [[Drakensberg]] Mountains, Newcastle is located in the northwest corner of the province along the [[Ncandu River]].

Newcastle is the seat of the [[Newcastle Local Municipality|local municipality]], and the [[Amajuba District Municipality]]. Newcastle's municipal area is {{convert|1855|km2|lk=out|abbr=off}}, ranking Newcastle as South Africa's 15th-largest city and consists of 34 wards.

The [[N11 (South Africa)|N11]] and [[R34 (South Africa)|R34]] are the principal roads linking the city to the rest of South Africa.

==History==

===Toponymy===
Newcastle has changed names on numerous occasions during the country's historic rule. It was initially named Post Halt Number 2 on military maps during the 1840s, as postal coaches stopped here to obtain fresh horses on the journey between [[Durban]] (then Port Natal in [[Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.places.co.za/html/newcastle.html|title=Newcastle|work=places.co.za}}</ref> and [[Johannesburg]]. It was later known as the Waterfall River Township because of the [[Ncandu River]]. Newcastle was named after the British Colonial Secretary, the [[Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle|fifth Duke of Newcastle]], a British aristocrat, and not the city in England as some believe. On 14 October 1899, during the Anglo-Boer War, Newcastle was invaded by Boer forces, and the entire district was incorporated into the Transvaal Republic. After seven months it was renamed Viljoensdorp, after the commander of the Johannesburg Commando, General Ben Viljoen. However, after relief of Ladysmith under the command of General Redver Buller, the British forces reclaimed the name Newcastle.

===Establishment===
Newcastle (then Post Halt Number 2) was strategically situated in 1854 by the Surveyor-General of the Natal Colony, Dr. P.C. Sutherland on the banks of the flooded [[Ncandu River]]. In 1864, Newcastle was founded on the site, becoming the fourth settlement to be established in Natal after [[Durban]], [[Weenen]] and [[Pietermaritzburg]].

===War and British rule===
In 1876, Fort Amiel was constructed to ward off the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulus]] during the war, and in 1873 Newcastle became a separate electoral division.<ref name="theal-281">{{cite book|last=Theal|first=George McCall|title=History of South Africa, from 1873 to 1884, twelve eventful years, with continuation of the history of Galekaland, Tembuland, Pondoland, and Bethshuanaland until the annexation of those territories to the Cape Colony, and of Zululand until its annexation to Natal|publisher=Allen|location=London|year=1919|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofsouthaf02theauoft/page/281 281]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofsouthaf02theauoft|access-date=20 August 2009}}</ref> To commemorate [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s Diamond Jubilee (60th anniversary), the construction of a [[sandstone]] town hall commenced in 1897, and was completed two years later. The town was used as a depot by the British during both the [[First Boer War|First]] and [[Second Boer War]], and also functioned as a major transport junction and stopover for [[wagon]]s and post chaises during the late 19th century.

British preparation work for the [[Pretoria Convention]] of 1881 was done at Newcastle.<ref name="theal-128">{{cite book|last=Theal|first=George McCall|title=History of South Africa, from 1873 to 1884, twelve eventful years, with continuation of the history of Galekaland, Tembuland, Pondoland, and Bethshuanaland until the annexation of those territories to the Cape Colony, and of Zululand until its annexation to Natal|publisher=Allen|location=London|year=1919|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofsouthaf02theauoft/page/128 128]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofsouthaf02theauoft|access-date=20 August 2009}}</ref>

===The Industrial Era===
In 1890, the first train arrived in Newcastle, and the town was declared a borough in 1891. The discovery of coal brought a new era of prosperity, and several ambitious building projects were planned. In 1920, the Union Steel Corporation built the province's first steel plant, which later became the [[Mittal Steel South Africa|ISCOR]] South Works and subsequently decommissioned the plant after the [[Mittal Steel South Africa|ISCOR]] North Works was built, now called Arcelor Mittal Newcastle Works.

Today, Newcastle is the main commercial and industrial centre in northern KwaZulu-Natal, and is the province's third-largest city. The municipality is making efforts for the city to become sustainable by 2030. Newcastle is the gateway to the [[Zulu Kingdom]] from the [[Free State (province)|Free State]] and [[Mpumalanga]].

==Geography and climate==

[[File:Newcastle surrounded by the Northern Drakensberg Mountains.jpg|thumb|Newcastle surrounded by the Northern Drakensberg Mountains]]

Located at approximately {{convert|1194|m|0|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]], Newcastle is located in the northwest corner of the province of KwaZulu-Natal at the foothills of the northern [[Drakensberg]] mountains. The city has a temperate climate and is classified under the country's 'Cold Interior'. Temperatures in Newcastle often drop below freezing during the winter months, with snowfall often experienced at least twice a decade. Newcastle's summer temperatures have exceeded 40 degrees Celsius in the recent past due to the 2015 El Niño weather phenomenon, with the region experiencing drought conditions after 28 years.

==Demographics==
Zulus form the largest single ethnic group. Due to its past, Newcastle has a large number of British, Afrikaner, and Indian people, with several places of worship and spiritual organizations based in the city's suburbs.

Since the mid-1980s, the city has seen an influx of Chinese citizens. The approximately 200 Chinese-owned businesses have contributed to Newcastle's textile and plastic manufacturing industries. The abolishing of Apartheid has seen the establishment of the Buddhist Light Association's Mediation Centre and Chinese School on Victoria Road. Since 1995, Indian, Pakistan, and African foreign nationals have also migrated to Newcastle.{{Cn|date=October 2024}}

==Economy==

Newcastle has the largest concentration of commerce and industry in northern [[KwaZulu-Natal]]. The city serves the surrounding towns of Utrecht, Vryheid, Dannhauser, Glencoe and Dundee, as well as the farmers, South Africa at large, and the export market with a range of products and goods.

===Industry===
The city has four industrial areas, namely Riverside Industrial, Airport Industrial, Madadeni Industrial Estate, and Arcelor Mittal Newcastle Works. Newcastle's economy is dominated by heavy industry, clothing and textile, services, and engineering industries, as well as extensive local coal mining.

[[Mittal Steel South Africa|Arcelor Mittal]] steelworks, the Natal Portland Cement (NPC) slagment cement plant, the LANXESS Chrome Chemical Plant and the [[Karbochem]] synthetic rubber plant, which covers {{convert|500000|m²|0|abbr=off}} manufacturing space dominate the Newcastle industrial area. Heavy engineering works firms such as DCD Venco and Boschpick Engineering supply ancillary services to the aforementioned large concerns and the rest of South Africa. 

[[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] businesspeople established more than a hundred textile factories in the Riverside Industrial Estate and the Madadeni Industrial Estate.

In 2011 Independent Power South Africa (IPSA) converted the old Ngagane Power Station into the Newcastle Cogeneration Plant, an 18 MW gas fired powerstation that provides a dedicated power supply to the [[Karbochem]] chrome chemical plant which was completed during 2002.  

This joint venture project between Karbochem and German speciality chemical manufacturing giant [[LANXESS]] has made Newcastle the largest producer of [[Chromium|chrome]] chemicals in Africa. The company announced an investment of €40 million in 2012 towards the construction of an innovative CO<sub>2</sub> plant ([[Cansolv]] chemical process) at its site.

[[Arcelor Mittal]] Newcastle produces over 1.5 million tons of long steel products annually and in 2015 undertook a major reline on the N5 Blast Furnace valued at R1.8 billion.

In mid-2014, a portion of Airport Industrial was renamed the Newcastle Chemical Park, and houses African Amines (Pty) Ltd, Karbochem (Pty) Ltd, KC Energy (Pty) Ltd, LANXESS (CISA) (Pty) Ltd, Newcastle Co-generation (IPSA), and South African Calcium Carbide (Pty) Ltd.

Other large operations include firms such as Formosa Plastics and Nova Clothing, both of which manufacture goods for the country's leading retailers, diamond-cutting works, various engineering concerns, and building industry-related services such as brick manufacturing, roofing systems, and steel reinforcement.
