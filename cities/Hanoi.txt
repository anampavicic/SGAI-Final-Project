In the third century BCE, the [[Cổ Loa Citadel|Cổ Loa Capital Citadel]] of [[Âu Lạc]] was constructed in what is now Hanoi. Âu Lạc then [[Vietnam under Chinese rule|fell under Chinese rule for around a thousand years]]. In 1010, Vietnamese emperor [[Lý Thái Tổ]] established the capital of the imperial Vietnamese nation [[Đại Việt]] in modern-day central Hanoi, naming the city '''Thăng Long''' ({{Literal translation|ascending dragon}}). In 1428, king [[Lê Lợi]] renamed the city to '''Đông Kinh''' ({{lang|vi-Hani|[[wikt:東京|東京]]}}, {{Literal translation|eastern capital}}), and remained being so until 1789. The [[Nguyễn dynasty]] in 1802 moved the national capital to [[Huế]] and the city was renamed Hanoi in 1831. It served as the capital of [[French Indochina]] from 1902 to 1945. After the [[August Revolution]], the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] designated Hanoi as the capital of the newly independent country. In 2008, [[Hà Tây Province]] and two other rural districts were annexed into Hanoi, almost tripling Hanoi's area.

Hanoi is the cultural, economic and education center of [[Northern Vietnam]]. As the country's capital, it hosts [[List of diplomatic missions in Vietnam|78 foreign embassies]], the headquarters of [[People's Army of Vietnam]], its own [[Vietnam National University, Hanoi|Vietnam National University system]], and many other governmental organizations. Hanoi is also a major tourist destination, with 18.7 million domestic and international visitors in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Thương |first=Báo Công |date=2022-12-31 |title=Năm 2022: Hà Nội đón 18,7 triệu lượt du khách {{!}} Báo Công Thương |url=https://congthuong.vn/nam-2022-ha-noi-don-187-trieu-luot-du-khach-233173.html |access-date=2024-01-07 |website=Báo Công Thương điện tử, kinh tế, chính trị, xã hội |language=vi}}</ref> The city hosts the [[Imperial Citadel of Thăng Long]], [[Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum]], [[Hoàn Kiếm Lake]], [[West Lake (Hanoi)|West Lake]], and [[Ba Vì National Park]] near the outskirts of the municipality.

Hanoi has had various names throughout history. It was known first as Long Biên ({{lang|vi-Hani|龍編}}, {{Literal translation|dragons interweaving}}), then Tống Bình ({{lang|vi-Hani|宋平}}, {{Literal translation|[[Song]] pacification}}) and Long Đỗ ({{lang|vi-Hani|龍肚}}, {{Literal translation|dragon belly}}). ''Long Biên'' later gave its name to the famed [[Long Biên Bridge]], built during [[French Indochina|French colonial]] times, and more recently to a [[Long Biên District|new district]] to the east of the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]]. Several older names of Hanoi feature ''long'' ({{lang|vi-Hani|龍}}, {{Translation|dragon}}), linked to the curved formation of the Red River around the city, which was symbolized as a dragon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lands named "dragon"|url=http://tuoitre.vn/tin/ao-trang/20120109/nhung-vung-dat-mang-ten-rong/472123.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423152322/http://tuoitre.vn/tin/ao-trang/20120109/nhung-vung-dat-mang-ten-rong/472123.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 April 2017|publisher=[[Tuổi Trẻ]]|access-date=23 April 2017|author=Con Giang|date=9 January 2012}}</ref><ref name="dantri" /><ref name="hanoitv" />

In 866, it was turned into a citadel and named Đại La ({{lang|vi-Hani|大羅}}, {{Literal translation|big net}}). This gave it the nickname La Thành ({{lang|vi-Hani|羅城}}, {{Literal translation|''La'' citadel}}). Both ''Đại La'' and ''La Thành'' are names of major streets in modern Hanoi. When [[Lý Thái Tổ]] established the capital in the area in 1010, it was named Thăng Long ({{lang|vi-Hani|昇龍}}).<ref>Anh Thư Hà, Hồng Đức Trần A Brief Chronology of Vietnam's History 2000– Page 40  "Taking this as a good omen, he named the new capital Thăng Long (City of the Soaring Dragon), now Hanoi.

Pelley ''Postcolonial Vietnam: New Histories of the National Past'' 2002– Page 213 "When Lý Thái Tổ relocated the capital in 1010."</ref> ''Thăng Long'' later became the name of a major [[Thăng Long Bridge|bridge]] on the highway linking the city center to [[Noi Bai Airport|Nội Bài Airport]], and the Thăng Long Boulevard expressway in the southwest of the city center. In modern times, the city is usually referred to as ''Thăng Long – Hà Nội'', when its long history is discussed.

During the [[Hồ dynasty]], it was called Đông Đô ({{lang|vi-Hani|東都}}, {{Literal translation|eastern metropolis}}).<ref name="dantri" /><ref name="laodong" /> During the [[Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam|Ming occupation]], it was called Đông Quan ({{lang|vi-Hani|東關}}, {{Literal translation|eastern gate}}).<ref name="dantri" /><ref name="hanoitv" /><ref name="laodong" /> During the [[Lê dynasty]], Hanoi was known as Đông Kinh ({{lang|vi-Hani|東京}}),<ref>''For the de facto capital city of Japan, see [[Tokyo]]'' ({{lang|ja|東京}}).</ref> which gave the name to [[Tonkin]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. A square adjacent to the [[Hoàn Kiếm lake]] was named ''Đông Kinh Nghĩa Thục'' after the reformist [[Tonkin Free School]] under French colonization.<ref name="dantri" /><ref name="laodong" />

{{For timeline}}

=== Pre-Thăng Long period ===

Many vestiges of human habitation from the late [[Palaeolithic]] and early [[Mesolithic]] ages can be found in Hanoi. Between 1971 and 1972, archaeologists in Ba Vì and Đông Anh discovered pebbles with traces of carving and processing by human hands that are relics of [[Sơn Vi Culture]], dating from 10,000 to 20,000 years ago.<ref name=cl>{{cite web|title=Prehistoric Co Loa|date=3 August 2013|url=https://www.hoangthanhthanglong.vn/en/co-loa-thoi-tien-su/507|access-date=22 February 2021|archive-date=16 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210616082820/https://www.hoangthanhthanglong.vn/en/co-loa-thoi-tien-su/507|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Phan|Nguyễn|Nguyễn|1997|p=27}} In 1998–1999, the Museum of Vietnamese History (now [[National Museum of Vietnamese History]]) carried out the archaeological studies in the north of {{Interlanguage link|Đồng Mô Lake|lt=Đồng Mô Lake|vi|Hồ Đồng Mô}} ([[Sơn Tây, Hanoi|Sơn Tây]], Hanoi), finding various relics and objects belonging to the [[Sơn Vi Culture]] dating back to the [[Paleolithic age|Paleolithic Age]] around 20,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web|title=The pre and proto history human traces found in Dong Mo, Son Tay|date=28 February 2014|url=http://baotanglichsu.vn/en/Articles/3188/15839/the-pre-and-proto-history-human-traces-found-in-dong-mo-son-tay.html|access-date=22 February 2021|archive-date=15 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211015101321/http://baotanglichsu.vn/en/Articles/3188/15839/the-pre-and-proto-history-human-traces-found-in-dong-mo-son-tay.html|url-status=live}}</ref> During the mid-Holocene transgression, the sea level rose and immersed low-lying areas; geological data clearly show the coastline was inundated and was located near present-day Hanoi, as is apparent from the absence of Neolithic sites across most of the Bac Bo region.{{sfn|Nam C.

Kim|2015|p=144}}{{sfn|Nam C. Kim|2015|p=159}}

==== Kingdom of Âu Lạc and Nanyue ====
In around third century BC, [[An Dương Vương]] established the capital of [[Âu Lạc]] north of present-day Hanoi, where a fortified citadel is constructed, known to history as [[Cổ Loa]],{{sfn|Taylor|2013|p=14}} the first political center of the Vietnamese civilization pre-Sinitic era,{{sfn|Miksic|Yian|2016|p=111}} with an outer embankment covering 600 [[hectares]]. In 179 BC, the Âu Lạc Kingdom was annexed by [[Nanyue]], which ushered in more than a thousand years of Chinese domination. Zhao Tuo subsequently incorporated the regions into his [[Nanyue]] domain, but left the indigenous chiefs in control of the population.{{sfn|Jamieson|1995|p=8}}{{sfn|Brindley|2015|p=93}}{{sfn|Buttinger|1958|p=92}} For the first time, the region formed part of a polity headed by a Chinese ruler.{{sfn|Kiernan|2019|p=69}}

==== Hanoi under Chinese rule ====
In 111 BC, the Han dynasty [[Han conquest of Nanyue|conquered Nanyue]] and [[First Chinese domination of Vietnam|ruled it]] for the next several hundred years.{{sfn|Taylor|1983|p=28}}{{sfn|Đào Duy Anh|2016|p=42}} [[Han dynasty]] organized Nanyue into seven commanderies of the south (Lingnan) and now included three in Vietnam alone: Giao Chỉ and Cửu Chân, and a newly established Nhật Nam.{{sfn|Taylor|1983|p=30}}{{sfn|Kiernan|2019|p=72}}

In March{{sfn|Bielestein|1986|p=271}} of 40 AD, Trưng Trắc and Trưng Nhị, daughters of a wealthy aristocratic family of [[Lac Viet|Lac]] ethnicity{{sfn|Brindley|2015|p=235}} in Mê Linh district (Hanoi), led the locals to rise up in rebellion against the Han.{{sfn|Bielestein|1986|p=271}}{{sfn|Yü|1986|p=454}}{{sfn|Kiernan|2019|p=78}} It began at the [[Red River Delta]], but quickly spread both south and north from Jiaozhi, stirring up all three Lạc Việt regions and most of Lingnan,{{sfn|Kiernan|2019|p=78}}{{sfn|Brindley|2015|p=235}} gaining the support of about 65 towns and settlements.{{sfn|Yü|1986|p=454}} Trưng sisters then established their court upriver in Mê Linh.{{sfn|Kiernan|2019|p=79}}{{sfn|Taylor|1983|p=38}} In 42 AD, the Han emperor commissioned general [[Ma Yuan (Han dynasty)|Ma Yuan]] to suppress the uprising with 32,000 men, including 20,000 regulars and 12,000 regional auxiliaries.{{sfn|Yü|1986|p=454}}{{sfn|Kiernan|2019|p=79}} The rebellion was defeated in the next year as [[Ma Yuan (Han dynasty)|Ma Yuan]] captured and decapitated Trưng Trắc and Trưng Nhị, then sent their heads to the Han court in [[Luoyang]].{{sfn|Kiernan|2019|p=80}}

By the middle of the fifth century, in the center of ancient Hanoi, a fortified settlement was founded by the [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] [[Liu Song Dynasty|Liu Song]] [[list of Chinese dynasties|dynasty]] as the [[county seat|seat]] of a new district called [[Tống Bình]] (Songping) within [[Jiaozhi Commandery|Giao Chỉ]] [[commandery (China)|commandery]].{{sfnp|Tran|1977|p=16}} The name refers to its pacification by the dynasty.

==== Protectorate of Annam ====
By the year 679, the [[Tang dynasty]] changed the region's name to [[Annam (Chinese province)|Annan]] ({{Cjkv|c={{linktext|安南}}|p=|v=An Nam|l=pacified south}}), with Songping as its capital.<ref name="en.hanoi.vietnamplus.vn">{{cite web|url=http://en.hanoi.vietnamplus.vn/Home/Historical-stages-of-Thang-Long-Hanoi/20099/89.vnplus |title=Historical stages of Thang Long- Hanoi – 1000 Years Thang Long (VietNamPlus) |publisher=En.hanoi.vietnamplus.vn |access-date=24 November 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104062703/http://en.hanoi.vietnamplus.vn/Home/Historical-stages-of-Thang-Long-Hanoi/20099/89.vnplus |archive-date=4 November 2013 }}</ref>

In the latter half of the eighth century, Zhang Boyi, a viceroy from the [[Tang dynasty]], built Luocheng ({{Cjkv|c=羅城|v=La Thành}}) to suppress popular uprisings. Luocheng extended from Thu Le to Quan Ngua in what is now [[Ba Đình district]]. Over time, in the first half of the ninth century, this fortification was expanded and renamed as Jincheng ({{CJKV|v=Kim Thành}}). In 863, the kingdom of [[Nanzhao]], as well as local rebels, laid siege of Jincheng and defeated the Chinese armies of 150,000.<ref name="ZZTJ250">''Tư trị thông giám'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷250|quyển 250]].</ref>{{sfn|Kiernan|2019|p=123}} In 866, Chinese [[jiedushi]] [[Gao Pian]] recaptured the city and drove out the Nanzhao and rebels.{{sfn|Kiernan|2019|p=123}} He renamed the city to Daluocheng ({{Cjkv|c=大羅城|v=Đại La Thành}}).

=== Hanoi under Independent Vietnam ===
==== Thăng Long, Đông Đô, Đông Quan, Đông Kinh ====
In 1010, [[Lý Thái Tổ]], the first ruler of the [[Lý dynasty]], moved the capital of [[Đại Việt]] to the site of the Đại La Citadel. Claiming to have seen a dragon ascending the Red River, he renamed the site Thăng Long (昇龍) – a name still used poetically to this day. Thăng Long remained the capital of Đại Việt until 1397, when it was moved to [[Thanh Hóa]], then known as Tây Đô (西都), the "Western Capital". Thăng Long then became Đông Đô (東都), the "Eastern Capital".

In 1408, the Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] attacked and occupied Vietnam, changing Đông Đô's name to Dongguan ({{CJKV|c=東關|v=Đông Quan|l=eastern gate}}). In 1428, the [[Lam Sơn uprising]], under the leadership of [[Lê Lợi]], overthrew the Chinese rule. Lê Lợi founded the [[Lê dynasty]] and renamed Đông Quan to Đông Kinh (東京) or [[Tonkin]]. During 17th century, the population of Đông Kinh was estimated by Western diplomats as about 100,000.{{sfn|Boudarel|Nguyen|Nguyễn|2002|p=19}} Right after the end of the [[Tây Sơn dynasty]], it was named Bắc Thành (北城).

When the [[Nguyễn dynasty]] was established in 1802, [[Gia Long]] moved the capital to [[Huế]]. Thăng Long was no longer the capital, and its [[chữ Hán]] was changed from 昇龍 ({{Literal translation|ascending dragon}}) to the homophone 昇隆 ({{Literal translation|ascent and prosperity}}), in order to reduce any loyalist sentiment towards the old Lê dynasty<!--tìm cách làm giảm tình cảm nhớ về nhà Lê-->.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Đặng Việt Thủy |last2=Đặng Thành Trung |title=54 vị Hoàng đế Việt Nam |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Quân đội Nhân dân |place=Hà Nội |year=2008 | pages=286–287}}</ref> Emperors of Vietnam usually used [[Vietnamese dragon|dragon]] (龍 ''long'') as a symbol of their imperial strength and power. In 1831, the Nguyễn emperor [[Minh Mạng]] renamed it Hà Nội (河內). Hanoi was [[Battle of Hanoi (1873)|conquered and briefly occupied]] by the [[French Third Republic|French]] military in late 1873 and passed to them [[Battle of Hanoi (1882)|ten years later]]. As Hanoi, it was located in the [[Tonkin (French protectorate)|protectorate of Tonkin]] and became the capital of [[French Indochina]] in 1902.

=== During WWII, First Indochina War, and the Vietnam War ===
[[File:Lac-hoan-kiem-archives.jpg|thumb|Bird-eye view of Hanoi in 1944; the Hoan Kiem lake in the middle.]]
The city was occupied by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in 1940, Japan overthrew French rule in Hanoi in March 1945. After the [[August Revolution|fall]] of the [[Empire of Vietnam]], it became the capital of the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] (DRV) when [[Ho Chi Minh]] proclaimed the independence of Vietnam on 2 September 1945. However, the French returned and reoccupied the city in February 1947. On 8 March 1949, Hanoi became under the control of the [[State of Vietnam]] (created by the [[Élysée Accords]]), an [[associated state]] within the [[French Union]]. This state gained independence with the Matignon Accords on 4 June 1954. After nine years of fighting between the French and DRV forces, Hanoi became the capital of [[North Vietnam]] when this territory became a [[sovereign state|sovereign country]] on 21 July 1954. The army of the French Union withdrew that year and the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] of the DRV and [[International Control Commission]] occupied the city on 10 October the same year under the terms of the [[1954 Geneva Conference]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hastings |first=Max |title=Vietnam: an Epic Tragedy, 1945–1975 |date=2018 |isbn=978-0-06-240566-1 |edition=1st |location=New York, NY |publisher=Harper |oclc=1001744417}}</ref>

During the [[Vietnam War]] between North and South (1955-1975), Hanoi and North Vietnam were attacked by the United States and [[South Vietnam]]ese Air Forces. Following the end of the war with the [[fall of Saigon]], Hanoi became the capital of the [[Vietnam|Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] when North and South Vietnam were reunited on 2 July 1976.<ref>{{cite news

On 21 December 1978, the [[National Assembly of Vietnam]] approved a law to expand Hanoi's borders, absorbing the districts of [[Ba Vì district|Ba Vì]], [[Thạch Thất district|Thạch Thất]], [[Phúc Thọ district|Phúc Thọ]], [[Đan Phượng district|Đan Phượng]], [[Hoài Đức district|Hoài Đức]], and the town of [[Sơn Tây, Hanoi|Sơn Tây]] from [[Hà Sơn Bình province|Hà Sơn Bình Province]], and the districts of [[Mê Linh district|Mê Linh]] and [[Sóc Sơn district|Sóc Sơn]] from {{Interlanguage link|Vĩnh Phú Province|lt=Vĩnh Phú Province|vi|Vĩnh Phú (tỉnh)}}. The five districts annexed from Hà Sơn Bình would be given to [[Hà Tây province|Hà Tây]] and Mê Linh to [[Vĩnh Phúc province|Vĩnh Phúc]] in 1991; they would be re-annexed into Hanoi in 2008.

After the [[Đổi Mới]] economic policies were approved in 1986, the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]] and national and municipal governments hoped to attract international investments for [[Urban planning|urban development]] projects in Hanoi.<ref name="Logan 2005 559–575">{{Cite journal |last=Logan |first=William S. |date=2005 |title=The Cultural Role of Capital Cities: Hanoi and Hue, Vietnam |jstor=40022968 |journal=Pacific Affairs |volume=78 |issue=4 |pages=559–575 |doi=10.5509/2005784559}}</ref> High-rise commercial buildings did not begin to appear until ten years later due to the international investment community being skeptical of the security of their investments in Vietnam.<ref name="Logan 2005 559–575" /> Rapid urban development and rising costs displaced many residential areas in central Hanoi.<ref name="Logan 2005 559–575" /> Following a short period of economic stagnation after the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], Hanoi resumed its rapid economic growth.<ref name="Logan 2005 559–575" />

Hanoi has experienced rapid expansion in its modern period, accompanied by a construction boom. Skyscrapers, appearing in new urban areas, have dramatically changed the cityscape and have formed a modern skyline outside the old city. In 2015, Hanoi is ranked 39th by [[Emporis]] in the list of world cities with most skyscrapers over 100&nbsp;m; its two tallest buildings are [[Hanoi Landmark 72 Tower]] (336&nbsp;m, second tallest in Vietnam after Ho Chi Minh City's [[Landmark 81]] and third tallest in south-east Asia after Malaysia's [[Petronas Towers]]) and [[Hanoi Lotte Center]] (272&nbsp;m, also, third tallest in Vietnam).

Public outcry in opposition to the redevelopment of culturally significant areas in Hanoi persuaded the national government to implement a low-rise policy surrounding [[Hoàn Kiếm Lake]].<ref name="Logan 2005 559–575" /> The [[Ba Đình District]] is also protected from commercial redevelopment.<ref name="Logan 2005 559–575" />

On 12 September 2023, at least 56 people died in a huge [[2023 Hanoi building fire|fire in an apartment block]] in Hanoi.

== Geography ==

=== Location, topography ===
Hanoi is a landlocked municipality in the northern region of Vietnam, situated in Vietnam's Red River delta, nearly {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=on}} from the coast. Hanoi contains three basic kinds of terrain, which are the delta area, the midland area and the mountainous zone. In general, the terrain becomes gradually lower from north to south and from west to east, with the average height ranging from 5 to 20 meters above sea level. Hills and mountainous zones are located in the northern and western parts of the city. The highest peak is at Ba Vi with 1281&nbsp;m, located west of the city proper.

== Administrative divisions ==
[[File:Bản đồ Hà Nội.png|thumb|upright=1.15 |Administrative divisions of Hanoi]]Hà Nội is divided into 12 urban districts, 1 district-leveled town and 17 rural districts. When [[Hà Tây province|Hà Tây]] was merged into Hanoi in 2008, [[Hà Đông District|Hà Đông]] was transformed into an urban district while [[Sơn Tây]] is demoted to a district-level town. They are further subdivided into 22 commune-level towns (or townlets), 399 communes, and 145 wards.

[[File:Vietnamese Women in Ao Dai.png|thumb|240x240px|Vietnamese women wearing traditional costume [[Áo dài]]]]
During the French colonial period, as the capital of [[French Indochina]], Hanoi attracted a considerable number of French, Chinese and Vietnamese from the surrounding areas. In the 1940s the population of the city was 132,145.<ref>Baron & La Salle. ''Dictionnaire des Communes administratif et militaire, France métropolitaine et France d'outre-mer''. Paris: Charles-Lavauzelle & Cie, 1949.</ref> After the [[First Indochina War]], many French and Chinese people left the city to either move south or repatriate.

Hanoi's population only started to increase rapidly in the second half 20th century. In 1954, the city had 53 thousand inhabitants, covering an area of 152&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. By 1961, the area of the city had expanded to 584&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, and the population was 91,000 people. In 1978, [[National Assembly (Vietnam)]] decided to expand Hanoi for the second time to 2,136&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, with a population of 2.5&nbsp;million people.<ref name="papin">{{cite book

Hanoi is the second most populous city in the country, after [[Ho Chi Minh City]] (8,993,082 people). The average annual population growth rate from 2009 to 2019 of Hanoi is 2.22%/year, higher than the national growth rate (1.14%/year) and is the second highest in the Red River Delta, only after [[Bắc Ninh Province]] (2.90% / year).

Nowadays, the city is both a major metropolitan area of Northern Vietnam, and also the country's cultural and political centre, putting a lot of pressure on the infrastructure, some of which is antiquated and dates back to the early 20th century. It has over eight million residents within the [[city proper]] and an estimated population of 20 million within the [[Hanoi Capital Region|metropolitan area]].

The number of Hanoians who have settled down for more than three generations is likely to be very small when compared to the overall population of the city. Even in the [[Old Quarter, Hanoi|Old Quarter]], where commerce started hundreds of years ago and consisted mostly of family businesses, many of the street-front stores nowadays are owned by merchants and retailers from other provinces. The original owner family may have either rented out the store and moved into the adjoining house or moved out of the neighborhood altogether. The pace of change has especially escalated after the abandonment of central-planning economic policies and relaxing of the district-based household registrar system.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hanoi to scrap its own conditions for residency registration|url=http://hanoitimes.vn/hanoi-to-scrap-its-own-conditions-for-residency-registration-313351.html|access-date=18 May 2021|website=Hanoi Times |language=en|archive-date=18 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210518015227/http://hanoitimes.vn/hanoi-to-scrap-its-own-conditions-for-residency-registration-313351.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Hanoi's [[Telephone numbers in Vietnam|telephone numbers]] have been increased to 8 digits to cope with demand (October 2008). Subscribers' telephone numbers have been changed in a haphazard way; however, mobile phones and [[Subscriber identity module|SIM cards]] are readily available in Vietnam, with [[Prepaid mobile phone|pre-paid mobile phone credit]] available in all areas of Hanoi.

=== Religion ===
The [[three teachings]] ({{lang-vi|tam giáo}}) of [[Buddhism in Vietnam|Buddhism]], [[Taoism in Vietnam|Taoism]], and [[Confucianism]] have been the main religions of Hanoi for many years. Most people consider themselves Buddhist, though not all of them regularly follow religion.

=== Ethnic groups ===
{{See also|List of ethnic groups in Vietnam}}
There are more than 50 ethnic groups in Hanoi, of which the Viet (Kinh) is the largest; according to official Vietnamese figures (2019 census), accounting for 98.66% of the population, followed by [[Muong people|Mường]] at 0.77% and [[Tày people|Tày]] at 0.24%.<ref name="census2019" />

Hanoi is part of the [[Maritime Silk Road]] that runs from the Chinese coast through the [[Strait of Malacca]] towards the [[South India|southern tip of India]] to [[Mombasa]], from there through the [[Red Sea]] via the [[Suez Canal]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], there to the Upper [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] region to the [[Northern Italy|northern Italian]] hub of [[Trieste]] with its rail connections to [[Central Europe]] and the [[North Sea]].<ref>Marcus Hernig: Die Renaissance der Seidenstraße (2018) pp. 112.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Map |url=https://www.theage.com.au/interactive/2018/Chinas-trillion-dollar-sharp-power-play/src/interactives/map/routes.html |access-date=23 January 2021 |archive-date=20 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210620223730/https://www.theage.com.au/interactive/2018/Chinas-trillion-dollar-sharp-power-play/src/interactives/map/routes.html |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Jianglin Zhao "21st-century Maritime Silk Road Initiative" (2020), pp. 204.</ref>

== Development ==

=== Infrastructural development ===
A development master plan for Hanoi was designed by [[Ernest Hébrard|Ernest Hebrard]] in 1924, but was only partially implemented.<ref name="FORBES 2001 68–84" /> The previous close relationship between the [[Soviet Union]] and Vietnam led to the creation of the first comprehensive plan for Hanoi with the assistance of [[Gosplan|Soviet planners]] between 1981 and 1984.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Kiem |first=Nguyen Manh |date=1996 |title=Strategic Orientation for Construction and Development of Hanoi, Vietnam |jstor=4314433 |journal=Ambio |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=108–109}}</ref> It was never realized because it appeared to be incompatible with Hanoi's existing layout.<ref name="FORBES 2001 68–84" />

In recent years, two master plans have been created to guide Hanoi's development.<ref name="FORBES 2001 68–84" /> The first was the Hanoi Master Plan 1990–2010, approved in April 1992. It was created out of collaboration between planners from Hanoi and the National Institute of Urban and Rural Planning in the [[Ministry of Construction (Vietnam)|Ministry of Construction]].<ref name="FORBES 2001 68–84" /> The plan's three main objectives were to create housing and a new commercial center in an area known as Nghĩa Đô, expand residential and industrial areas in the [[Gia Lâm District]], and develop the three southern corridors linking Hanoi to [[Hà Đông District|Hà Đông]] and the [[Thanh Trì District]].<ref name="FORBES 2001 68–84" /> The result of the land-use pattern was meant to resemble a five cornered star by 2010.<ref name="FORBES 2001 68–84" /> In 1998, a revised version of the Hanoi Master plan was approved to be completed in 2020.<ref name="FORBES 2001 68–84" /> It addressed the significant increase of population projections within Hanoi. Population densities and high rise buildings in the inner city were planned to be limited to protect the old parts of inner Hanoi.<ref name="FORBES 2001 68–84" /> A rail transport system is planned to be built to expand public transport and link the Hanoi to surrounding areas. Projects such as airport upgrading, a golf course, and cultural villages have been approved for development by the government.<ref name="FORBES 2001 68–84" />

In the late 1980s, the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) and the Vietnamese government had designed a project to develop rural infrastructure.<ref name="FORBES 2001 68–84" /> The project focused on improving roads, water supply and sanitation, and educational, health and social facilities because economic development in the [[Commune (Vietnam)|communes]] and rural areas surrounding Hanoi is dependent on the infrastructural links between the rural and urban areas, especially for the sale of rural products.<ref name="FORBES 2001 68–84" /> The project aimed to use locally available resources and knowledge such as compressed earth construction techniques for building. It was jointly funded by the [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]], the Vietnamese government, and resources raised by the local communities and governments. In four communes, the local communities contributed 37% of the total budget.<ref name="FORBES 2001 68–84" /> Local labor, community support, and joint funding were decided as necessary for the long-term sustainability of the project.<ref name="FORBES 2001 68–84" />

=== Civil society development ===
Part of the goals of the [[Đổi Mới]] economic reforms was to decentralize governance for purpose of economic improvement. This led to the establishment of the first issue-oriented civic organizations in Hanoi. In the 1990s, Hanoi experienced significant poverty alleviation as a result of both the market reforms and civil society movements.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor=j.ctt2jbjk6.22 |journal=Viet Nam – A Transition Tiger? |date=2004 |publisher=ANU Press |isbn=978-0-7315-3750-1 |editor-last=Van Arkadie |editor-first=Brian |pages=224–234 |editor-last2=Mallon |editor-first2=Raymond |last1=Van Arkadie |first1=Brian |title=Poverty Alleviation |last2=Mallon |first2=Raymond}}</ref> Most of the civic organizations in Hanoi were established after 1995, at a rate much slower than in [[Ho Chi Minh City]].<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite journal |journal=Asian Survey |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=867–889 |jstor=10.1525/as.2003.43.6.867 |language=en |doi=10.1525/as.2003.43.6.867 |last1=Wischermann |first1=Joerg |title=VIETNAM IN THE ERA OF DOI MOI: Issue-Oriented Organizations and Their Relationship to the Government |year=2003 |s2cid=59469399}}</ref> Organizations in Hanoi are more "tradition-bound", focused on policy, education, research, professional interests, and appealing to governmental organizations to solve social problems.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> This marked difference from [[Ho Chi Minh City|Ho Chi Minh's]] civic organizations, which practice more direct intervention to tackle social issues, may be attributed to the different societal identities of North and South Vietnam.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> Hanoi-based civic organizations use more systematic development and less of a direct intervention approach to deal with issues of rural development, poverty alleviation, and environmental protection. They rely more heavily on full-time staff than volunteers. In Hanoi, 16.7% of civic organizations accept anyone as a registered member and 73.9% claim to have their own budgets, as opposed to 90.9% in [[Ho Chi Minh City]].<ref name="ReferenceA" /> A majority of the civic organizations in Hanoi find it difficult to work with governmental organizations. Many of the strained relations between non-governmental and governmental organizations results from [[statism]], a bias against non-state organizations on the part of government entities.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

[[File:One Pillar Pagoda Hanoi.jpg|thumb|[[One Pillar Pagoda]]|215x215px]]
As the capital of Vietnam for almost a thousand years, Hanoi is considered one of the main cultural centres of Vietnam, where most Vietnamese dynasties have left their imprint. Even though some relics have not survived through wars and time, the city still has many interesting cultural and historic monuments for visitors and residents alike. Even when the nation's capital moved to [[Huế]] under the Nguyễn Dynasty in 1802, the city of Hanoi continued to flourish, especially after the French took control in 1888 and modeled the city's architecture to their tastes, lending an important aesthetic to the city's rich stylistic heritage. The city hosts more cultural sites than any other city in Vietnam,<ref>{{cite web

=== Old Quarter ===
{{Main|Old Quarter, Hanoi{{!}}Old Quarter}}
[[File:Old Quarter, Hanoi (12) (38496654951).jpg|thumb|A street in [[Old Quarter, Hanoi|Hanoi's Old Quarter]]|215x215px]]The Old Quarter, near [[Hoàn Kiếm Lake]], maintains most of the original street layout and some of the architecture of old Hanoi. At the beginning of the 20th century Hanoi consisted of the "36 streets", the citadel, and some of the newer French buildings south of Hoàn Kiếm lake, most of which are now part of Hoàn Kiếm district.{{sfn|Logan|2000|p={{pn|date=January 2024}}}} Each street had merchants and households specializing in a particular trade, such as silk, jewelry or even bamboo. The street names still reflect these specializations, although few of them remain exclusively in their original commerce.{{sfn|Forbes|Henley|2012|p={{pn|date=January 2024}}}} The area is famous for its specializations in trades such as traditional medicine and local handicrafts, including silk shops, bamboo carpenters, and tin smiths. Local cuisine specialties as well as several clubs and bars can be found here also. A night market (near [[Đồng Xuân Market]]) in the heart of the district opens for business every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evening with a variety of clothing, souvenirs and food.

The city's more than six decades of French colonization, as well as centuries of sociocultural influence from China, have influenced the designs of the old houses in Hanoi. The Franco-Chinese or hybrid architectural styles can be reflected in the front of a house in the co-existence of French-styled columns, Confucian scrolls, the Taoist yin-yang sign, and the Buddhist lotus sculpture.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Vuong |first1=Quan-Hoang |last2=Bui |first2=Quang-Khiem |last3=La |first3=Viet-Phuong |last4=Vuong |first4=Thu-Trang |last5=Ho |first5=Manh-Toan |last6=Nguyen |first6=Hong-Kong T. |last7=Nguyen |first7=Hong-Ngoc |last8=Nghiem |first8=Kien-Cuong P. |last9=Ho |first9=Manh-Tung |date=2019-01-01 |title=Cultural evolution in Vietnam's early 20th century: A Bayesian networks analysis of Hanoi Franco-Chinese house designs |journal=Social Sciences & Humanities Open |language=en |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=100001 |doi=10.1016/j.ssaho.2019.100001 |s2cid=203239554 |issn=2590-2911 |doi-access=free |arxiv=1903.00817 }}</ref>

=== Imperial sites ===
[[File:Temple of Literature - main gate.jpg|thumb|Front gate of the Temple of Literature]]
Imperial sites are mostly in [[Ba Đình District]] and a bit of [[Đống Đa District]]. They are juxtaposed with French colonial architecture (villas, administrative buildings and tree-lined boulevards). Some prominent edifices from feudal time include the [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]] (''Văn Miếu''), site of the oldest university in [[Vietnam]] which was started in 1010, the [[One Pillar Pagoda]] (''Chùa Một Cột'') which was built based on the dream of king [[Lý Thái Tông]] (1028–1054) in 1049, and the [[Flag Tower of Hanoi]] (''Cột cờ Hà Nội''). In 2004, a massive part of the 900-year-old [[Hanoi Citadel]] was discovered in central Hanoi, near the site of [[Ba Đình Square]].<ref>{{cite news

=== Lakes ===
A city between rivers built on lowlands, Hanoi has many scenic lakes and is sometimes called the "city of lakes". Among its lakes, the most famous are [[Hoàn Kiếm Lake]], [[West Lake (Hanoi)|West Lake]], [[Trúc Bạch Lake]] and Bảy Mẫu Lake (inside Thống Nhất Park). Hoàn Kiếm Lake, also known as Sword Lake, is the historical and cultural center of Hanoi, and is linked to the legend of the [[Thuận Thiên (sword)|magic sword]]. West Lake (Hồ Tây) is a popular place for people to spend time. It is the largest lake in Hanoi, with many temples in the area. The lakeside road in the Nghi Tam – Quang Ba area is perfect for bicycling, jogging and viewing the cityscape or enjoying the lotus ponds in the summer. The best way to see the majestic beauty of a West Lake sunset is to view it from one of the many bars around the lake, especially from The Summit at Pan Pacific Hanoi (formally known as Summit Lounge at Sofitel Plaza Hanoi).

=== Colonial Hanoi ===

Hanoi was the capital and the administrative center for [[French Indochina]] for most of the colonial period (from 1902 to 1945). The [[French colonial architecture|French colonial architectural style]] became dominant,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Byrnes |first=Mark |date=2012-02-22 |publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |title= The Paris-ification of Hanoi |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-02-21/the-paris-ification-of-hanoi |access-date=18 October 2022 }}</ref> and many examples remain today: tree-lined boulevards (such as Phan Dinh Phung street, Hoang Dieu street and Tran Phu street) and many villas, mansions, and government buildings. Some notable colonial structures are an eclectic mixture of French and traditional Vietnamese architectural styles, such as the [[National Museum of Vietnamese History]], the [[Vietnam National Museum of Fine Arts]] and the old [[Indochina Medical College]]. Gouveneur-Général [[Paul Doumer]] (1898–1902) played a crucial role in colonial Hanoi's urban planning. Under his tenure there was a major construction boom.<ref>Michael G. Vann, "Building Whiteness on the Red River: Race, Power, and Urbanism in Paul Doumer's Hanoi, 1897–1902," ''Historical Reflections/Réflexions Historiques'', 2007</ref>

The tourist destinations in Hanoi are generally grouped into two main areas: the [[Old Quarter, Hanoi|Old Quarter]] and the French Quarter(s). The "Old Quarter" is in the northern half of [[Hoàn Kiếm District]] with small street blocks and alleys, and a traditional Vietnamese atmosphere. Many streets in the Old Quarter have names signifying the goods ("hàng") the local merchants were or are specialized in. For example, "Hàng Bạc" (''silver stores'') still have many stores specializing in trading silver and jewelries.

Two areas are generally called the "French Quarters": the governmental area in [[Ba Đình District]] and the south of Hoàn Kiếm District. Both areas have distinctive [[French Colonial]] style villas and broad tree-lined avenues.

The political center of Vietnam, Ba Đình has a high concentration of Vietnamese government headquarters, including the [[Presidential Palace, Hanoi|Presidential Palace]], the [[National Assembly Building of Vietnam|National Assembly Building]], and several ministries and embassies, most of which used administrative buildings of colonial [[French Indochina]]. The [[One Pillar Pagoda]], the [[Chu Văn An High School (Hanoi)|Lycée du Protectorat]] and the [[Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum]] are also in Ba Dinh.

South of Hoàn Kiếm's "French Quarter" has several French colonial landmarks, including the [[Hanoi Opera House]], the [[Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi]] hotel, the [[National Museum of Vietnamese History]] (formerly the [[École française d'Extrême-Orient]]), and the [[St. Joseph's Cathedral, Hanoi|St. Joseph's Cathedral]]. Most of the French-Colonial buildings in Hoan Kiem are now used as foreign embassies.

== Entertainment ==
[[File:Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre2 cropped.JPG|thumb|215x215px|Performance of the water puppet theatre ''Thăng Long'']]
A variety of options for entertainment in Hanoi can be found throughout the city. Modern and traditional theaters, cinemas, karaoke bars, dance clubs, bowling alleys, and an abundance of opportunities for shopping provide leisure activity for both locals and tourists. Hanoi has been named one of the top 10 cities for shopping in Asia by Water Puppet Tours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://waterpuppettours.com/ |title=Detailed results and winners of the online Smart Travel Asia Best in Travel Poll 2009 |website=Smarttravelasia.com |access-date=18 June 2010 |archive-date=9 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509140827/http://waterpuppettours.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The number of art galleries exhibiting Vietnamese art has dramatically increased in recent years, now including galleries such as "Nhat Huy" of [[Huynh Thong Nhat]].

Nhà Triển Lãm at 29 Hang Bai street hosts regular photo, sculpture, and paint exhibitions in conjuncture with local artists and travelling international expositions.

A popular traditional form of entertainment is [[water puppetry]], which is shown, for example, at the ''Thăng Long Water Puppet Theatre.''

== Cuisine ==
[[File:Bún chả Vietnamese food.jpg|thumb|[[Bun cha|Bún Chả]], a dish that originated in Hanoi.|215x215px]]
Hanoi has rich culinary traditions. Many of Vietnam's most famous dishes, such as [[bún chả]], [[Cha Ca La Vong|chả cá Lã Vọng]], [[bánh cuốn]] and [[cốm]] originated in Hanoi. Bún chả, a dish consisting of charcoal roasted pork served in a sweet/salty soup with rice noodle vermicelli and lettuce, is by far the most popular food item among locals. President [[Barack Obama]] famously tried this dish at a Le Van Huu eatery with [[Anthony Bourdain]] in 2016, prompting the opening of a bún chả restaurant bearing his name in the Old Quarter.

== Education ==
[[File:Indochina Medical College.jpg|thumb|The Hanoi Medical University was the first modern university in Vietnam.|215x215px]]

Hanoi, as the capital of French Indochina, was home to the first Western-style universities in Indochina, including ''Indochina Medical College'' (1902) – now [[Hanoi Medical University]], ''Indochina University'' (1904) – now [[Vietnam National University, Hanoi|Hanoi National University]] (the largest), and ''École Supérieure des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine'' (1925) – now [[Hanoi College of Fine Arts|Hanoi University of Fine Art]].

After the Communist Party of Vietnam took control of Hanoi in 1954, many new universities were built, most prominently the [[Hanoi University of Science and Technology]]. Recently ULIS ([[University of Languages and International Studies]]) was rated as one of the top universities in south-east Asia for languages and language studies at the undergraduate level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/universities/vietnam-national-university-hanoi/undergrad |title=Vietnam National University, Hanoi |publisher=Top Universities |date=8 December 2012 |access-date=24 November 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015184420/http://www.topuniversities.com/universities/vietnam-national-university-hanoi/undergrad |archive-date=15 October 2013 }}</ref> Other universities that are not part of [[Vietnam National University, Hanoi|Vietnam National University]] or Hanoi University include Hanoi School for Public Health, Hanoi School of Agriculture, [[Electric Power University]] and [[University of Transport and Communications]].

The majority of universities in Hanoi are public, although in recent years a number of private universities have begun operation. [[Thăng Long University]], founded in 1988 by Vietnamese mathematics professors in Hanoi and France,<ref>{{cite web |work=Viet Nam News |title=Growing university reflects VN's progress |date=2006-01-29 |url=http://vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn/showarticle.php?num=01INN290106 |access-date=18 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214105524/https://vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn/showarticle.php?num=01INN290106 |archive-date=14 December 2009 }}</ref> was the first private university in Vietnam. Because many of Vietnam's major universities are located in Hanoi, students from other provinces (especially in the northern part of the country) wishing to enter university often travel to Hanoi for the annual entrance examination. Such events usually take place in June and July, during which a large number of students and their families converge on the city for several weeks around the intense examination periods. In recent years, these entrance exams have been coordinated by the Ministry of Education, but entrance requirements are decided independently by each university.

Although there are state owned [[kindergarten]]s, there are also many private ventures that serve both local and international needs. [[Pre-tertiary-education|Pre-tertiary]] (elementary and secondary) schools in Hanoi are generally state run, but there are also some independent schools. Education is equivalent to the K–12 system in the U.S., with elementary school between grades 1 and 5, middle school (or junior high) between grades 6 and 9, and [[High school (upper secondary)|high school]] from grades 10 to 12. There are several specialised schools (also known as high schools for the gifted) in Hanoi where students with the most academic prowess attend. 

Education levels are much higher within the city of Hanoi in comparison to the suburban areas outside the city. About 33.8% of the labor force in the city has completed secondary school in contrast to 19.4% in the suburbs.<ref name="FORBES 2001 68–84" /> 21% of the labor force in the city has completed tertiary education in contrast to 4.1% in the suburbs.<ref name="FORBES 2001 68–84" />

Hanoi is served by [[Noi Bai International Airport]], located in Soc Son District, approximately {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} north of Hanoi. The new international terminal (T2), designed and built by Japanese contractors, opened in January 2015 and is a big facelift for the airport. In addition, a new highway and the new [[Nhật Tân Bridge|Nhat Tan cable-stay bridge]] connecting the airport and the city center opened at the same time, offering much more convenience than the old road (via Thang Long bridge). Taxis are plentiful and usually have meters, although it is also common to agree on the trip price before taking a taxi from the airport to the city centre.

Hanoi is also the origin or departure point for many [[Vietnam Railways]] train routes in the country with 6 national railway lines passing through the city with a total length of {{convert|162|km|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Figure1" /> The [[North–South Railway (Vietnam)|Reunification Express]] (tàu Thống Nhất) runs from Hanoi to [[Ho Chi Minh City]] from [[Hanoi railway station|Hanoi station]] (formerly Hang Co station), with stops at cities and provinces along the line. Trains also depart Hanoi frequently for Hai Phong and other northern cities.

The main means of transport within Hanoi are motorbikes, buses, taxis, and a rising number of cars. In recent decades, motorbikes have overtaken bicycles as the main form of transportation. Cars are the most notable change in the past five years as many Vietnamese people have started to purchase them for the first time. The increasing number of cars is the main cause of gridlocks, as roads and infrastructure in older parts of Hanoi were not designed to accommodate them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Imminent gridlock |author1=Hans-Heinrich Bass |author2=Thanh Trung Nguyen |website=dandc.eu |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/vietnam-needs-tackle-urban-traffic-congestion |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105182238/http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/vietnam-needs-tackle-urban-traffic-congestion |archive-date=5 November 2013 }}</ref> On 4 July 2017, the Hanoi government voted to ban motorbikes entirely by 2030 to reduce pollution, congestion, and encourage the expansion and use of public transport.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40498052|title=Hanoi plan to ban motorbikes by 2030 to combat pollution|date=4 July 2017|publisher=BBC News|access-date=5 July 2017|language=en-GB|archive-date=4 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704235050/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40498052|url-status=live}}</ref> The number of vehicles registered in Hanoi as of July 2022 is over 7.6 million, including more than 1 million cars, over 6.4 million motorcycles of and 179,000 electric motorbikes.
