'''Juiz de Fora''' ({{IPA|pt-BR|ˈʒwiz dʒi ˈfɔɾɐ}}; {{lit|[[juiz de fora (office)|Outsider Judge]]}}), also known as '''J.F.''', is a city in the southeastern Brazilian state of [[Minas Gerais]], approximately {{convert|40|km}} from the state border with [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]].  According to the 2022 census the current population is 540,756 inhabitants.  The geographical area of the municipality is {{convert|1437|km2|abbr=on}}.

The city's location was a key factor in its economic and demographic development since it is situated between the three most important financial and economic metropolises of [[Southeast Region, Brazil|southeast Brazil]] (and also the three largest [[urban sprawl]]s of the country):  Rio de Janeiro ({{convert|189|km|abbr=on}}), Belo Horizonte ({{convert|260|km|abbr=on}}) and [[São Paulo]] ({{convert|486|km|abbr=on}}). Major highways connect Juiz de Fora with these three metropolitan areas, the most important being the BR 040 which connects [[Brasília]] with [[Rio de Janeiro]] via [[Belo Horizonte]]. The city is built on the [[Paraibuna River (Minas Gerais)|Paraibuna]], a major tributary of the [[Paraíba do Sul]] river.

==History==
[[Image:Juiz de fora (1893).jpg|thumb|Juiz de Fora in 1893.]]

The origins of Juiz de Fora can be traced back to the beginnings of the 18th century, when the [[Caminho Novo]] (''New Way'') road was opened linking [[Rio de Janeiro]] to the gold rush area of [[Minas Gerais]] around Vila Rica (now [[Ouro Preto]]). The region was covered with dense forest (hence its name; "Zona da Mata", ''Forest Zone''). Despite the opening of the new route the area remained largely uninhabited and most of its scarce settlement was centered on the road itself. The first permanent inhabitants of the municipality were merchants and farmers who supplied the travelers' needs on the long road between the coast and the gold region.

Further development would only take place after the decline of gold mining in the central zone of [[Minas Gerais]]. The capital previously invested in the mines was now invested in coffee plantations, and the region of [[Zona da Mata (Minas Gerais)|Zona da Mata]] became a fertile ground to invest in. The position of the village then called Santo Antônio do [[Paraibuna River (Minas Gerais)|Paraibuna]] was favourable due to the road connection with the capital of the country and its harbour.

In 1850 the small village was officially elevated to city status. Progress continued in 1861 with the completion of the first [[macadamized]] road in Latin America, the [[Estrada União e Indústria]] (Union and Industry), replacing the Caminho Novo. Its name reflected the newfound wealth of the city, for industry replaced coffee-related agriculture as its economic heart.  Five years later a new railway, the [[Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil|Estrada de Ferro Dom Pedro II]], reached the city and in 1889 the first hydroelectric powerplant of Latin America ([[Marmelos Zero Power Plant|Marmelos Zero]]) was built on the Paraibuna river on the outskirts of the city along the Estrada União e Indústria.

As both foreign and domestic capital fueled the industrial boom the city became a major centre (becoming the largest urban area of the state). By first decade of the 20th century Juiz de Fora was among the main textile and industrial producers in South America and in [[Brazil]] particularly. The city's wealth was second only to major cities such as [[São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. But as the coffee rush frontier moved southwestwards it reached the [[state of São Paulo]] and its immensely fertile plateaus which became the richest in the federation and industry flourished there as it had in Juiz de Fora itself. The city of Juiz de Fora became the major industrial centre in a state that was being much surpassed by [[São Paulo]] in industrial output, and worse still much of the wealth generated by the state (a large bulk by Juiz de Fora itself) was being used in the building of the new state capital [[Belo Horizonte]] (replacing [[Ouro Preto]] at the centre of the gold region), founded at the end of the 19th century and which, in the Brazilian and Latin-American tradition of centralization, was intended to be the largest city of the state. The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s worsened the city's decay which would only be overcome five decades later. By the 1940s the city had lost its nationwide influence due to the continued growth of Belo Horizonte and the loss of industry.

The city's decay can be seen in the figures for its population which remained stagnant from the early 1930s to the late 1960s. By the mid-1970s, the city started to experience new growth, which continues to this day. This new era began with the establishment of a federal university ([[UFJF]]) in the city and the decision by the Brazilian military junta (1964–1985) to promote the city as a major military centre. This sparked a phenomenon rarely experienced by post-industrial towns: the industrial rebirth of the city, this time following Brazilian industrialization itself, based on heavy-industry such as steel and engineering.

Recently, the city seems to be experiencing a new era in its history, again following a boom in Brazilian economy, and is reinventing itself as a major centre for services (such as telecommunications, with an important call centre) and education (following the federal university, private colleges have been established in the city).

Today Juiz de Fora is an important commercial centre for the surrounding region and is the core of an unofficial metropolitan area of more than 1 million inhabitants.

There are important steel mills and automotive factories ([[Mercedes-Benz]] being the most famous) in the city, along with several textile factories.

The city is also an important trade center with a considerable area of influence, being considered the capital of the [[Zona da Mata (Minas Gerais)|Zona da Mata]] region of the state. It has four big shopping malls, several hyper-marts and many smaller shops.

The massive presence of immigrants – especially from [[Portugal]], Italy, Germany, [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] and more recently China  – throughout its history has given the city a cosmopolitan spirit and diverse cuisine. Walking down Rio Branco Avenue, (the city's several kilometers long main avenue) one can find typical German, Italian, Arabic, Portuguese, Chinese and Japanese restaurants, as well as traditional Brazilian and vegetarian cuisine.

Juiz de Fora is an important regional cultural center, one of the few towns in south-east Minas Gerais to have permanently functional cinemas, theatres, music venues and light entertainment. There is a nationally important museum ([[Museu Mariano Procópio]]) and a Philharmonic Orchestra (Orquestra Filarmônica Pró-Musica). The city also hosts a yearly classical music festival, the Festival Internacional de Música Brasileira Colonial e Música Antiga (International Festival of Brazilian Colonial Music and Early Music).
