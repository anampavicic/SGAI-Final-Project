'''Libmanan''', officially the '''Municipality of Libmanan''' ({{lang-bcl|Banwaan kan Libmanan}}; {{lang-tl|Bayan ng Libmanan}}), is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Camarines Sur]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 112,994 people.{{PH census|current}} Libmanan is the largest municipality in Camarines Sur in terms of population, and the second largest in terms of land area.

The municipality's history dates back to before the beginning of Spanish colonization, and its city center is home to a number of beautiful historic [[Art Deco]] buildings including the palatial Morales Ruins which soar over the road entering Libmanan proper.

==History==

Libmanan was a barrio of Quipayo in 1580 with the name of "Pinaglabanan". Records from a historian Mauro B. Avila, revealed that the municipality was named Libmanan on September 15, 1574. Missionaries started working in Libmanan in 1589 and the area's church was dedicated to St. James the Apostle.

German ethnographer [[Fedor Jagor]] described visiting Libmanan in his 1875 work "Travels in the Philippines", wherein he visited the local parish priest and learned from him about an ancient human settlement that had been dug up in 1851 during road construction in the Poro area of the southwest close near the Tres Marias islands: the excavation consisted of "numerous remains of the early inhabitants—skulls, ribs, bones of men and animals, a child’s thighbone inserted in a spiral of brass wire, several stags’ horns, beautifully-formed dishes and vessels, some of them painted, probably of Chinese origin; striped bracelets, of a soft, gypseous, copper-red rock, gleaming as if they were varnished; small copper knives, but no iron utensils; and several broad flat stones bored through the middle; besides a wedge of petrified wood, embedded in a cleft branch of a tree."<ref>{{cite book|last=Jagor|first=Fedor|date=1875|title=Travels in the Philippines|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/10770/10770-h/10770-h.htm|location=London|publisher=Chapman and Hall|page=155|isbn=9781230389998}}</ref>

During the occupation of their country by the [[United States]], the [[Philippine Legislature]] greatly expanded the network of railroads throughout the island of [[Luzon]], and a railway headed to the city of [[Legazpi, Albay]] and [[Naga, Camarines Sur]] was built through Libmanan to provide direct access to those cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pnr.gov.ph/history.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227040648/http://pnr.gov.ph/history.htm|archive-date=2009-02-27|title=Home}}</ref> This railway was damaged severely during [[World War II]], but partially restored using American funds thereafter, providing transportation service down the [[Bicol Peninsula]] off and on until ending in 2012 despite plans to rehabilitate the route.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/94477-pnr-bicol-train-december-2015|title = PNR eyeing resumption of Bicol trips by December|date = 27 May 2015}}</ref>

The historic Morales Ruins Art Deco mansion at the heart of the town was built in 1937 by the Rev. Friar Mariano Roldan for his parents, and was eventually sold to the Morales family whose name the ruins now bear. It is noted for art deco frescos which are emblematic of the period in which it was built, one of which includes a defiantly displayed Filipino national flag, which would have been disallowed by the American and Japanese occupiers of the time.<ref>{{cite web |url-access=limited |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/iarchive/facebook/1890178787875393/2311069322453002 |archive-date=2022-04-30 |url=https://www.facebook.com/LIBHISCULSOC/posts/roldans-ancestral-housepoblacion-libmanan-camarines-sur-this-house-is-the-roldan/2311069322453002/ |title=Libmanan Historico Cultural Society on Facebook |website=[[Facebook]]}}{{cbignore}}{{User-generated source|certain=yes|date=March 2022}}</ref>

Even during the time of the Spaniards, the town of Libmanan was already considered the "rice basket" of the province.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} This generous production of rice is attributed to the fertile soil and the town's abundant water supply. In 1991 the area's irrigation canals (shared with its northern neighbor [[Cabusao, Camarines Sur]]) were sufficient to water 2996 hectares of land during the dry season.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bagdion |first1=Benjamin |title=Joint Management of the Libmanan-Cabusao Pump Irrigation System between Farmers and the National Irrigation Administration in the Philippines|date=1991|publisher=International Water Management Institute|pages=1–4|url=http://publications.iwmi.org/pdf/H043548.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2014}}</ref>

Barangay Poblacion is often referred by locals as "Libmanan" while the surrounding urban Barangays are referred to as "Metropolitan Libmanan" or "Greater Poblacion Area" unofficial.

==Geography==
[[File:The puro island.jpg|thumbnail|right|Puro Island in [[Ragay Gulf]]]]
Libmanan has 3 sectors built up areas, flat land areas and mountainous land. 13,940 ha are flat land 19,239 ha are mountainous land and the remaining 1,103 ha are built up areas. Totalling in 34,282 hectares.

Libmanan is a large municipality, one of the biggest in Camarines Sur. It stretched across nearly the whole width of the Bicol peninsula, from where it borders Cabusao Municipality on the San Miguel Bay all the way out to [[Ragay Gulf]], including three islands known locally as the 'tres Marias', including one island known as 'puro island'. The main town, or 'poblacion', is located along the [[Bicol River|Libmanan River]] on the lowland alluvial plain adjacent to Cabusao.

Heading to the southern coast from the poblacion the municipality becomes hilly. In this hilly region between the poblacion and the highway lies the [[Libmanan Caves National Park]]. Continuing on towards the coast from the hills, the municipality becomes truly mountainous beginning in Barangay Malinao beyond the [[Pan-Philippine Highway]], where the "Boro-Boro Spring Resort" is located; a series of waterfalls that are a locally popular swimming destination.<ref>{{cite web|last1=malinao libmanan|title = Malinao libmanan|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NwDJ0ZEKgQ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/_NwDJ0ZEKgQ |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|website=Youtube|accessdate=10 July 2014}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Beyond Malinao the upland region features the mountain '[[Mount Bernacci]] (Tancong Vaca' - in the local dialect meaning 'the cow's hump') - which is a local landmark visible from most locations on the [[Pan-Philippine Highway]] in western Camarines Sur and was a base of operations for local guerrillas fighting the Japanese during [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Escandor|first1=Juan|title=Homegrown WW2 vets wait to receive call for recognition|journal=Bicol Mail|date=March 5, 2009|volume=25|issue=38}}</ref> Up to the present day, the area around Tancong Vaca has remained an area of conflict between anti-government insurgents and the [[Philippine National Police]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bicoltoday.com/2015/03/23/npa-warns-camarines-sur-mayors-on-allowing-town-cops-in-counter-insurgency-combat-operations/|title=NPA warns Camarines Sur Mayors on allowing town cops in counter-insurgency combat operations.|date=23 March 2015|website=bicoltoday.com|publisher=Bicol Today|access-date=25 March 2016|quote=The warning came up when four (4) policemen were wounded by guerillas of the Norben Gruta Command-New People’s Army (NGC-NPA) in a firefight Friday, March 13, at Barangays Pag-oring and Malinao in Libmanan, Camarines Sur.}}</ref>

The municipality's rural barangays lie behind Mount Bernacci, and mostly lack access to paved roads, of which there is only one which terminates in the fishing village of Barangay Bahao, within sight of the tres Marias.

== Economy ==
{{PH poverty incidence}}

Libmanan, one of the largest and most populous municipalities in the province, benefits from the transportation being offered by the Libmanan River, the railroad, and the national highway. Though rail service through Libmanan no longer connects directly to Manila there are still commuter trips available bringing passengers to nearby [[Naga, Camarines Sur]] and the route that was reopened in 2015 bringing them all the way to [[Legazpi, Albay]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/725131/pnr-starts-train-runs-from-naga-to-legazpi|title=PNR starts train runs from Naga to Legazpi|date=25 September 2015}}</ref>

Generally, Libmanan soil is adapted for growing different agricultural products. Portions are also adopted to pottery-the making of which has been a local industry for centuries. Libmanan has been the “rice-basket” not only of the province but of [[Southern Luzon]]-even during the Spanish regime. In spite of problems encountered by rice farmers, Libmanan maintains its status of being the rice granary of the province.

Libmanan is the heart of the provinces of Camarines Sur, Quezon and Camarines Norte making the municipality the rice basket of Southern Luzon, other than these provinces products can also reach Metro Manila.

Barangays of Bahao, Mambulo Nuevo, San Isidro, Bahay and Sibujo act as rural financial centers.

Rural areas are mostly dependent on agriculture and aquaculture, in the Poblacion District  however, there is an identified mini business district with the new public market and the LCC Supermarket with other small restaurants, banks, mini shops.

== Infrastructure ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2008}}
Libmanan is connected to Naga City through the Pan Philippine highway or AH26. The Poblacíon can be accessed through Bagacay Road (From South) and the Main Libmanan road (from North). Libmanan has 4 main roads longest one is the Pan Philippine highway that stretches from Beguito Viejo to Mambulo Nuevo second one is Libmanan Canaman Cabusao road that runs from Poblacion Area of Libmanan to Cabusao. Third is Bagacay Road that runs from Barangay Bagacay to the intersection of Libmanan road. The western and coastal Barangays can be reached through the new Bahao road that was constructed in 2019 this road not only serves as an enhancement to tourism but also to trade and industry, however some barangays of Libmanan still need an improvement on road infrastructure otherwise those Barangays will progress slow or even stagnant economy.

==Heritage==
The town possess one of the most important cultural examples of ancestral houses in western Camarines Sur. Among these architectural marvels are the 1920s municipal hall building with its arcade-embellished facade, the 1875 Dilanco House which is the oldest structure in the town and was home to three former municipal mayors, the 1937 Morales Ruins which is the most culturally-important Art Deco building in the town, the Nacieno House which is another Art Deco ancestral house, and the 1926 Jaucian House Jose Jaucian Sr. Another ancestral house that was demolished in the late 1970s is the house built by Don Celedonio Reyes, it was demolished to make way for more modern buildings opf the Bicol Central Academy.

Most heritage houses in the town have already been abandoned, including the Morales Ruins, Nacieno House, and the Dilanco  House. In 2013, a campaign was administered by some locals to transform the Morales Ruins into a municipal museum, along with other heritage houses in the town to spur a heritage-based tourism industry and to conserve the remaining immovable cultural heritage of the town.
