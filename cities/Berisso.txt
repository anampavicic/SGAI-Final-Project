==People==

Berisso was founded by [[Immigration in Argentina|Albanian immigrants]], and settled by Albanians and other European immigrants. The founder of the city, Juan Berisso ''([[Albanian language|Albanian]]: Gjon Berisha)'', was an [[arbëresh]]-[[Albanians|albanian]] immigrant from [[Italy]] and he named the city after him, [[Berisha (tribe)|Berisha]]. The name changed into Berisso for a better pronunciation. Most Berissenses ''(name referring to the people of Berisso)'' are of [[Albanian people|Albanian]], [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], or [[Polish people|Polish]] descent, but include those of [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[German people|German]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Arabs|Arab]], [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]], [[Croats|Croatian]], [[Armenians|Armenian]], [[Slovaks|Slovak]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]], [[Jews|Jewish]] and [[Greeks|Greek]] descent.

Because it is home to many ethnicities, Berisso is known as "The Provincial Capital of the Immigrant." Berisso's diversity is celebrated on September with their own "Immigrant's Festival."
