'''Coatzacoalcos''' ({{IPA|es|koatsakoˈalkos|lang}}; {{langx|nah|Koatzakwalko}}; [[Zapotec languages|Zapotec]]: {{lang|zap|Niniashi}}; [[Popolocan languages|Popoluca]]: ''Puertu'') is a major [[port]] city in the southern part of the [[States of Mexico|Mexican state]] of [[Veracruz]], mostly on the western side of the [[Coatzacoalcos River]] estuary, on the [[Bay of Campeche]], on the southern Gulf of Mexico coast. The city serves as the municipal seat of the [[municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] of the same name. The city had a 2020 census population of 212,540, making it the third-largest city in the state after [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] and [[Xalapa]]. The municipality covers a surface area of {{convert|471.16|km2|sqmi|3|abbr=on}} and reported a population of 310,698 persons.

==Etymology==
Coatzacoalcos comes from a [[Nahuatl]] word meaning "site of the Snake" or "where the snake hides."<ref name="wimmer">{{Cite web|last=Wimmer|first=Alexis|url=http://sites.estvideo.net/malinal/|title=DICTIONNAIRE de la langue NAHUATL CLASSIQUE|language=fr|access-date=4 April 2011|archive-date=7 March 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220307223930/http://sites.estvideo.net/malinal/|url-status=live}}</ref> According to the legend, this is where the god [[Quetzalcoatl]] made his final journey to the sea in around 999 and he made his promise to return.

==History==
[[File:Coatzacoalcos waterfront, 1904.jpg|thumb|left|Coatzacoalcos waterfront, circa 1904]]
Coatzacoalcos sits within the [[Olmec heartland]]. Excavations in 2008 for a tunnel under the Coatzacoalcos River indicate a substantial pre-Hispanic population.<ref name="Coatzacoalcos archaeological finds">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cronica.com.mx/nota.php?id_nota=352394|title=Coatzacoalcos archaeological finds|work=La Crónica de Hoy|date=16 March 2008|language=es|access-date=17 May 2008|archive-date=18 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118053722/http://cronica.com.mx/nota.php?id_nota=352394|url-status=live}}</ref> 
By the time of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish arrival]] the area was under [[Maya civilization|Mayan influence]]. In 1522, [[Hernán Cortés]] ordered [[Gonzalo de Sandoval]] to fund a settlement near Guazacualco. Sandoval named it '''Villa del Espíritu Santo'''.<ref name="enciclopedia">{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_veracruz |title=E-Local -Veracruz |language=es |access-date=2 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517162104/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_veracruz |archive-date=17 May 2011 }}</ref>

[[San Martin Tuxtla|San Martín Tuxtla]] is an active volcano lying northwest of Coatzcoalcos in the [[Sierra de los Tuxtlas]]. It erupted in 1664, in May 1793 with large ash falls and lava flows, and most recently in 1796.<ref name="smithsonian">{{Cite web|url=http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=1401-11=|title=Global Volcanism Program - San Martín - Summary|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|access-date=3 April 2011|archive-date=3 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503030403/http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=1401-11=|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The town was elevated to the category of port in 1825 and the name was changed to '''Coatzacoalcos'''.<ref name="enciclopedia"/>

The municipality of Coatzacoalcos was established 22 December 1881, with the town as its seat.<ref name="enciclopedia"/> In 1900 the town name was changed to '''Puerto México'''. In 1911 it was elevated to city, and in 1936 the name was changed to the current Coatzacoalcos.<ref name="enciclopedia"/>

On 23 July 1940, Coatzacoalcos welcomed refugees from the [[Spanish Civil War]] who sought asylum in Mexico after travelling across the Atlantic aboard the SS ''Santo Domingo''.<ref name="enciclopedia"/>

In 1959, the city suffered damage from an {{M|w}} 6.4 [[1959 Coatzacoalcos earthquake|earthquake]].<ref name=NGDC>{{citation|title=Significant Earthquake Database|url=https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazel/view/hazards/earthquake/event-more-info/4201|author=National Geophysical Data Center / World Data Service (NGDC/WDS)|publisher=[[National Geophysical Data Center]], [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]|doi=10.7289/V5TD9V7K|year=1959|type=Data Set|access-date=2022-03-04|archive-date=2022-03-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220304041107/https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazel/view/hazards/earthquake/event-more-info/4201|url-status=live}}</ref>

Coatzacoalcos became a very important crossroads during the oil boom of the 1970s, connecting the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] and oil fields in [[Campeche]] to the rest of Mexico and to the port of [[Salina Cruz]] in [[Oaxaca]] on the Pacific coast.

==Geography and climate==
The city is located at {{coord|18|9|N|94|26|W|}} where the [[Coatzacoalcos River]] [[debouch]]es into the [[Bay of Campeche]]. Overland it is connected by road and rail to the Pacific Ocean about {{Convert|160|km|mi}} away. This location has prompted plans for an interoceanic waterway across the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]], or for a much expanded railroad system, for over a century.

In the [[Köppen climate classification]] the climate is classified as [[tropical monsoon climate|Am]] for a [[tropical monsoon climate]]. A typical year sees more than {{Convert|290|cm|in}} of rainfall.<ref name="wbcs">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucm.es/info/cif/station/me-coatz.htm|title=Worldwide Bioclimatic Classification System Mexico-Coatzacoalcos|publisher=Worldwide Bioclimatic Classification System Phitosociological Research Center|language=es|access-date=2 April 2011|archive-date=21 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221114110/http://www.ucm.es/info/cif/station/me-coatz.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> Lying on the Gulf of Mexico, Coatzacoalcos has been struck by several hurricanes and tropical storms such as [[Hurricane Diana (1990)|Hurricane Diana]] in August 1990, [[Hurricane Mitch]] in November 1998, [[Tropical Storm Larry (2003)|Tropical Storm Larry]] in October 2003, [[Hurricane Stan]] in October 2005, [[Hurricane Dean]] in August 2007, [[Tropical Storm Marco (2008)|Tropical Storm Marco]] in October 2008, [[Tropical Storm Hermine (2010)|Tropical Storm Hermine]] in early September 2010, [[Hurricane Karl (2010)|Hurricane Karl]] in mid September 2010, [[Tropical Storm Matthew (2010)|Tropical Storm Matthew]] in late September 2010, [[Hurricane Richard (2010)|Hurricane Richard]] in October 2010 and [[Hurricane Agatha (2022)|Hurricane Agatha]] in late May 2022. The winter months are cooler and drier than the summer months. Occasionally, cold high pressure cells from North America drift south across the Gulf of Mexico and drive strong [[Tehuano wind]]s across the Isthmus, with very strong wind concentration taking place in [[Chivela Pass]] in Oaxaca.<ref name="bourassa">{{Cite web|last=Bourassa|first=Mark A.|author2=O'Brian, James J.|url=http://coaps.fsu.edu/~bourassa/pubs/tpec_HW/tpec_HW.shtml|title=Non-Inertial Flow in NSCAT Observations of Tehuantepec Winds|access-date=3 April 2011|archive-date=12 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712061640/http://www.coaps.fsu.edu/~bourassa/pubs/tpec_HW/tpec_HW.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Transportation ==
Coatzacoalcos has been a transportation hub for hundreds of years. It is connected via air, water, road, and rail to
the surrounding region and the rest of the world.

The [[Minatitlán/Coatzacoalcos National Airport]] is {{Convert|15|km|mi}} away in [[Cosoleacaque]] and has been an
international airport since August 2006.

The [[Port of Coatzacoalcos]] (Puerto México) is an international port of entry that provides transhipment of oil and petrochemicals.
After an upgrade to the railway along the Tehuantepec Route was opened in 1907 by [[Porfirio Díaz]] the port saw an increase of shipping via the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]], particularly from the [[American-Hawaiian Steamship Company]]. The port saw a decrease in traffic after the opening of the Panama Canal from 1914 on, but traffic has started to build up since the oil boom of the 1970s. The railway is now known as the [[Tren Interoceánico|Ferrocarril Transístmico]] ("Trans-Isthmic Railroad").

The [[CG Railway]] operates [[train ferry|train ferries]] between the Port of Coatzacoalcos and the [[United States]] at the [[Port of Mobile]] in [[Alabama]]. [[Ferrosur]] also provides rail service in and out of Coatzacoalcos as far southeast as [[Las Choapas, Veracruz|Las Choapas]], to the north and west to Veracruz and [[Mexico City]], as well as to the south over the Tehuantepec route now owned by [[Tren Interoceánico|Ferrocarril Transístmico]] from Medias Aguas to Salina Cruz in the state of [[Oaxaca]].<ref name="ferrosur">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ferrosur.com.mx/gxpsites/hgxpp001.aspx?1,1,17,O,S,0,MNU;E;10;1;MNU;,|title=Vias principales|language=es|access-date=3 April 2011|archive-date=27 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727205257/http://www.ferrosur.com.mx/gxpsites/hgxpp001.aspx?1,1,17,O,S,0,MNU;E;10;1;MNU;,|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Mexican Federal Highway 180]] follows the southern shore of the Bay of Campeche through Coatzacoalcos to the [[Yucatán Peninsula]].
