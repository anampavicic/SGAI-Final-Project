The [[Batı Raman oil field]], which is the largest oil field in Turkey, is located just outside the city. Batman has a local airport and a military airbase, which was used for transit of aircraft and helicopters in some search and rescue operations during the [[Gulf War]].

Until the 1950s, Batman was a village, with a population of about 3,000. However, oil fields were discovered around it in the 1940s that resulted in a rapid development of the area and in the inflow of workforce from other parts of Turkey. In 1957, the village was renamed Batman, after the river namesake, received a city status and became a district center. Over the next 50 years, a significant amount of Batman's one-story buildings were rebuilt as multi-story buildings. As a result, its population grew to many times its previous size. A {{convert|511|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} km long oil pipeline was built in 1967 from Batman to the port city of [[Dörtyol]] near the easternmost point of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast in order to transport the crude oil from the [[Tüpraş Batman Oil Refinery|Batman refinery]]. In 1990, the city became the capital of Batman Province.

Apart from oil, which is by far the dominant commodity of the region, Batman produces beverages, processed food, chemicals, furniture, footwear, machinery and transport equipment. A university was established in 2007, [[Batman University]], and is part of the [[Erasmus Programme|Erasmus foreign student exchange program]].

==History==
[[File:Zeynel_Bey_Mausoleum,_Hasankeyf.jpg|thumb|250px| Mausoleum of Zeynel Bey, son of Sultan [[Uzun Hasan]] (Hasan the Tall) of the [[Aq Qoyunlu]] dynasty, or White Sheep Turkomans (1378–1508)]]

=== Early history ===
The Batman Province contains the strategic Tigris River with fertile lands by its sides, as well as rocky hills with numerous caves providing a natural shelter. As a result, it was inhabited from prehistoric times, likely from the [[Neolithic]] ([[Paleolithic]]){{Contradict-inline|date=November 2022}} period, according to archeological evidence. First documented evidence of settlements in the province dates back to the 7th century BC. An artificial "island" was created in this marshy area, which was named ''elekhan'' and stood independent for 194 years from 546 BC until the invasion of [[Alexander the Great]] in 352 BC. The Batman Province was a religious center in the 4th–6th centuries AD and was part of the [[Byzantine Empire]] for seven centuries. In the 11th–12th centuries became under the control of the [[Great Seljuq Empire]] and [[Artuqids]] and became a prominent outpost of the [[Silk Road]]. This area was populated by [[Assyrian people|Syriac Christians]] and had a significant presence of [[Pontic Greeks]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Baghdadi Jews]] and [[Armenians]]; these peoples lived in the region from 500 BC to the late 19th century. Significant changes in its management and language were brought in 1515 by Mahmoud Pasha Elekhani. It is believed that a variant of his name, ''Elah'', was transformed into ''Iluh'' and gave the old name to the Batman city.<ref name="r1">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110310074232/http://www.gap.gov.tr/gap-provinces/batman Batman], gap.gov.tr</ref><ref name="g3">[https://web.archive.org/web/20111223064222/http://www.kultur.gov.tr/TR/belge/1-33025/tarihce.html Batman.

=== During Sayfo ===
During Sayfo a resistance mounted by the Assyrian population in the city of Batman, facing relentless persecution and violence at the hands of Kurdish tribes, employing guerrilla tactics and utilizing their intimate knowledge of the city's streets and alleyways, the defenders of Batman fought, and resist the forces of Kurds but the defense of Batman was ultimately suppressed.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bolton |first=Richard |url=http://oxford.totalh.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DEFENSE-OF-BATMAN.pdf |title=War – "The unresolved conflict between Kurdish and Assyrian"}}</ref> 

=== Modern history ===
[[File:Batman Saat Kulesi1.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Batman clock tower]]
The locality was made the capital of a district in the [[Siirt Province]] in 1957<ref name="r1" /> and as the Batman province was founded in May 1990, also its capital.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Deichmann|first=Somik V.

After that, Iluh became part of Beşiri sub-province.<ref>[[#Balaban|Balaban]], 152</ref> On 2 September 1957, the village became a district center and renamed Batman after the river flowing nearby, which was known under its modern name since at least the 19th century.<ref>{{cite book|title=Two essays on the geography of ancient Asia: intended partly to illustrate the campaigns of Alexander, and the Anabasis of Xenophon|url=https://archive.org/details/twoessaysongeog01willgoog|year=1829|publisher=J.

This administrative evolution reflected the rapid growth of the city owing to its oil extraction and refinement industries. Oil was found in the region in the 1930s and the oldest in Turkey refinery was built in 1955 to process crude oil of the Raman and Garzan areas. The refinery is operated by [[Tüpraş]], it has a processing capacity of 1.1 million tonnes per year and storage capacity of 253 billion m<sup>3</sup> (330,000 million cubic yards).<ref name="r1"/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160614234809/http://www.tupras.com.tr/detailpage.en.php?lPageID=1831 About Tüpraş refineries]. tupras.com.tr</ref><ref name="g1">[https://web.archive.org/web/20111223070809/http://www.kultur.gov.tr/TR/belge/1-33019/genel-bilgiler.html Batman.

Development of the oil fields outside the city resulted in a rapid growth of Batman beginning in the 1950s. As a result, the city was declared a "Priority Region for Development". A high school was established in the city in 1975 and most one-story houses were rebuilt into multi-story buildings. However, the large inflow of labor for the oil industry resulted in construction of hundreds of unauthorized small buildings on the outskirts of the city. Because of the wind direction, most industrial complexes were located in the southern and south-eastern areas.<ref name="b155">[[#Balaban|Balaban]], 155</ref>

== Kurdish–Turkish conflict ==
The oil-related development of Batman also resulted in relocation of Turkish people into a mostly Kurd-populated Batman Province. This has brought [[Kurdish rebellions in Turkey|ethnic conflicts]] that escalated in the 1990s. More than 180 civilians were killed in the Batman city area by unidentified gunmen between 1992 and 1993.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jonathan Rugman|author2=Roger Hutchings|title=Ataturk's Children|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GTtz79KJwV8C&pg=PA55|year= 2001|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8264-5490-4|pages=55–}}</ref> In June 2000, the then-Mayor Abdullah Akın attempted to rename up to 200 streets, and give them names of events of the Kurdish history or of people who supported the Kurdish culture.

==Industry==
[[File:Batman_Airport.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Batman Airport]]

Batman's primary commodity is oil, as there are multiple oil fields in the nearby area. These oil fields have spurred the creation of multiple pipelines to transmit oil to and from several important cities. Apart from oil, which is by far the dominant commodity of the region, Batman produces beverages, processed food, chemicals, furniture, footwear, machinery and transport equipment.<ref name="brit">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/56041/Batman Batman], Encyclopædia Britannica</ref>

=== Oil fields ===
Search for oil in the Batman Province started in 1935. On 20 April 1940, oil was found at a depth of {{convert|1048|m|abbr=off}} at the [[Raman oil field]], located south-east of Batman. The first experimental well began producing 10 tonnes (about {{convert|62|oilbbl|m3}}) of oil per day on 6 June 1940. The field was set to be expanded for commercial production by 1945, but the production was delayed to 1947 due to the lack of storage. To solve this, a small refinery was built at the site with a capacity of 9 tonnes/day in 1947, and in November 1948 a bigger refinery capable of processing up to 200 tonnes/day was completed in Batman. An even bigger refinery (330 tonnes/d) was completed in Batman in 1955.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111223061413/http://www.tpao.gov.tr/spe/history.htm History of petroleum], tpao.gov.tr</ref> Several other oil fields were discovered later around Batman, the largest being [[Batı Raman oil field]], which produces about {{convert|7000|oilbbl|m3}} of oil daily.<ref name="oil">{{cite journal|title=Upper cretaceous carbonate reservoirs of the Raman Field, Southeast Turkey|doi=10.1007/BF03174401|author=Gengiz Keskin and Cengiz Can|journal= Carbonates and Evaporites|year=1986|volume=1|issue=1|page=25|bibcode=1986CarEv...1...25K |s2cid=129219634}}</ref>

=== Pipelines ===
A {{convert|511|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} km long oil pipeline was built in 1967 from Batman to [[Dörtyol]], a port city located near the easternmost point of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast, to transport the crude oil from the Batman region. The pipeline has an annual capacity of 3.5 million tonnes and was transporting about {{convert|20|Moilbbl|m3}} (about 2.7 million tonnes) in the 1990s and about twice less between 2003 and 2007. Another, short pipeline {{convert|41|km|abbr=off}} long connected Batman with Şelmo, which is the location of the second largest oil field in Turkey.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110302090923/http://www.transatlanticpetroleum.com/s/Turkey.asp Turkey], TransAtlantic Petroleum</ref> It transferred between 1.5 and {{convert|0.5|Moilbbl|m3}} of oil per year between the years of 1990 and 2007.

==Geography==
[[File:Tigris 2015.jpg|275px|thumb|The [[Tigris]] river in [[Batman Province]].]]
Batman is built on a flat plateau elevated at {{convert|540|m|0|abbr=on}} above the sea level, though there is a declining slope of up to 0.6° in the northeastern and southern areas.<ref>[[#Balaban|Balaban]], 157</ref> There are almost no forests in and around the city. The Iluh River, a tributary of the Batman River, flows through the city.
