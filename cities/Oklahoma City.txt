'''Oklahoma City''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Oklahoma.ogg|,|oʊ|k|l|ə|'|h|oʊ|m|ə|_|-}}), officially the '''City of Oklahoma City''', and often shortened to '''OKC''', is the [[List of capitals in the United States|capital]] and [[List of municipalities in Oklahoma|most populous city]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oklahoma]].

Oklahoma City's city limits extend somewhat into [[Canadian County, Oklahoma|Canadian]], [[Cleveland County, Oklahoma|Cleveland]], and [[Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma|Pottawatomie]] counties. However, much of those areas outside the core Oklahoma County area are suburban tracts or protected rural zones ([[Drainage basin|watershed]]). The city is the [[List of United States cities by area|eighth-largest in the United States by area]] including [[Consolidated city-county|consolidated city-counties]]; it is the second-largest, after [[Houston]], not including consolidated cities. The city is also the second-largest by area among state capital cities in the United States, after [[Juneau, Alaska]].

Oklahoma City has one of the world's largest livestock markets.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.visitokc.com/about-okc/okc-districts/stockyards-city/ |title=Stockyards City &#124; Oklahoma City Districts |website=Visitokc.com}}</ref> Oil, natural gas, [[petroleum product]]s, and related industries are its economy's largest sector. The city is in the middle of an active oil field, and [[oil derrick]]s dot the capitol grounds. The federal government employs a large number of workers at [[Tinker Air Force Base]] and the [[United States Department of Transportation]]'s [[Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center]] (which house offices of the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] and the Transportation Department's Enterprise Service Center, respectively).

Oklahoma City is on the [[Interstate 35|I-35]] and [[Interstate 40|I-40]] corridors, one of the primary travel corridors south into neighboring Texas and [[New Mexico]], north towards [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], west to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], and east towards [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. Located in the state's [[Central Oklahoma|Frontier Country]] region, the city's northeast section lies in an ecological region known as the [[Cross Timbers]]. The city was founded during the [[Land Run of 1889]] and grew to a population of over 10,000 within hours of its founding. It was the site of the [[Oklahoma City bombing|April 19, 1995, bombing]] of the [[Alfred P.

By the time Oklahoma was admitted to the Union in 1907, Oklahoma City had surpassed [[Guthrie, Oklahoma|Guthrie]], the territorial capital, as the new state's population center and commercial hub. Soon after, the capital was moved from Guthrie to Oklahoma City.<ref>Curtis, Gene.

Before [[World War II]], Oklahoma City developed significant [[Meat packing industry|stockyards]], attracting jobs and revenue formerly in [[Chicago]] and [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. With the 1928 discovery of oil within the city limits (including under the State Capitol), Oklahoma City became a major center of oil production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ogs.ou.edu/fossilfuels/pdf/OKOilNotesPDF.pdf|title=Oklahoma Oil: Past, Present and Future|website=Ogs.ou.edu}}</ref> Post-war growth accompanied the construction of the [[Interstate Highway System]], which made Oklahoma City a major interchange as the convergence of [[Interstate 35|I-35]], [[Interstate 40|I-40]], and [[Interstate 44|I-44]]. It was also aided by the federal development of [[Tinker Air Force Base]] after successful lobbying efforts by the director of the Chamber of Commerce [[Stanley Draper]].

In 1950, the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] reported the city's population as 8.6% black and 90.7% white.<ref name="census">{{cite web|title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 12, 2012 }}</ref>

In 1959, the city government launched a "Great Annexation Drive" that expanded the city's area from {{convert|80|sqmi|km2}} to {{convert|475.55|sqmi|km2}} by the end of 1961, making it the largest U.S. city by land mass at the time.<ref name="smallwood">{{cite book |title=Urban Builder : Life and Times of Stanley Draper |chapter=Mr. Oklahoma City |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]] |last=Smallwood |first=James M. |date=1977 |isbn=0-8061-1447-9 |pages=197–198}}</ref>

Like many other American cities, the center city population declined in the 1970s and 1980s as families followed newly constructed highways to move to newer housing in nearby suburbs.

In 1993, the city passed a massive redevelopment package known as the [[Metropolitan Area Projects Plan|Metropolitan Area Projects]] (MAPS), intended to rebuild the city's core with civic projects to establish more activities and life in downtown. The city added a new [[Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark|baseball park]]; a central library; renovations to the [[Civic Center Music Hall|civic center]], [[Cox Convention Center|convention center]], and fairgrounds; and a water canal in the [[Bricktown, Oklahoma City|Bricktown]] entertainment district. Water taxis transport passengers within the district, adding color and activity along the canal. MAPS has become one of the most successful public-private partnerships undertaken in the U.S., exceeding $3&nbsp;billion in private investment as of 2010.<ref>[http://www.okcchamber.com/index.php?src=gendocs&ref=ChamberHistory&category=About Metropolitan Area Projects], Greater Oklahoma City Chamber. Retrieved February 5, 2010.</ref> As a result of MAPS, the population in downtown housing has exponentially increased, with the demand for additional residential and retail amenities, such as groceries, services, and shops.

Since the completion of the MAPS projects, the downtown area has seen continued development. Several downtown buildings are undergoing renovation/restoration. Notable among these was the restoration of the [[Skirvin Hotel]] in 2007. The famed [[First National Center (Oklahoma City)|First National Center]] is also being renovated.

Residents of Oklahoma City suffered substantial losses on April 19, 1995, when [[Timothy McVeigh]] [[Oklahoma City bombing|detonated a bomb]] in front of the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building|Murrah building]]. The building was destroyed (the remnants of which had to be imploded in a controlled demolition later that year), more than 100 nearby buildings suffered severe damage, and 168 people were killed.<ref name="VictimAges">{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |title=Victims of the Oklahoma City bombing |date=June 20, 2001 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2001-06-11-mcveigh-victims.htm |work=USA Today |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215065450/http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2001-06-11-mcveigh-victims.htm |archive-date=February 15, 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The site has been commemorated as the [[Oklahoma City National Memorial]] and Museum.<ref name="NPS">{{cite web|title=Oklahoma City National Memorial |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |url=http://www.nps.gov/okci/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514123638/http://www.nps.gov/okci/index.htm |archive-date=May 14, 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Since its opening in 2000, over three million people have visited.

The "Core-to-Shore" project was created to [[Oklahoma City Crosstown Expressway|relocate I-40 one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) south]] and replace it with a [[boulevard]] to create a landscaped entrance to the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.okc.gov/planning/coretoshore/index.html|title=Core to Shore at City of Oklahoma City|website=Okc.gov|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527103013/http://www.okc.gov/planning/coretoshore/index.html|archive-date=May 27, 2010}}</ref> This also allows the central portion of the city to expand south and connect with the shore of the Oklahoma River. Several elements of "Core to Shore" were included in the [[Metropolitan Area Projects Plan 3|MAPS 3]] proposal approved by voters in late 2009.

==Geography==
[[File:Oklahoma City Oklahoma.jpg|thumb|right|Mid-May 2006 photograph of Oklahoma City taken from the [[International Space Station]] (ISS)]]
Oklahoma City lies along one of the primary corridors into [[Texas]] and [[Mexico]] and is a three-hour drive from the [[Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex]]. The city is in the [[Central Oklahoma|Frontier Country]] region in the state's center, making it ideal for state government.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|620.34|sqmi|km2}},<ref name="okc.gov">{{cite web|title=About Oklahoma City|url=http://www.okc.gov/about/index.html|website=okc.gov|access-date=February 25, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223125833/http://okc.gov/about/index.html|archive-date=February 23, 2016}}</ref> of which {{convert|601.11|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|19.23|sqmi|km2}} is water.

Oklahoma City lies in the Sandstone Hills region of Oklahoma, known for hills of {{convert|250|to|400|ft|m|-1}} and two species of oak: [[blackjack oak]] (''Quercus marilandica'') and [[post oak]] (''Q. stellata'').<ref>[http://www.netstate.com/states/geography/ok_geography.htm Oklahoma Geography], NetState.com .

The city is roughly bisected by the [[North Canadian River]] (recently renamed the Oklahoma River inside city limits). The North Canadian once had sufficient flow to flood every year, wreaking destruction on surrounding areas, including the central business district and the original Oklahoma City Zoo.<ref>[http://www.oklahoma-city-life.com/history-of-the-oklahoma-city-zoo.html History of the Oklahoma City Zoo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117005255/http://www.oklahoma-city-life.com/history-of-the-oklahoma-city-zoo.html |date=January 17, 2016}}, Oklahoma City Life Web site.

{{Main|Neighborhoods of Oklahoma City}}
[[File:Automobile Alley in Oklahoma City.jpg|thumb|right|Automobile Alley in Oklahoma City]]
[[File:Heartofokc.jpg|thumb|Looking up in the heart of Oklahoma City's Central Business District]]
Oklahoma City neighborhoods are highly varied, with affluent historic neighborhoods located next to districts that have not wholly recovered from the economic and social decline of the 1970s and 1980s.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

The city is bisected geographically and culturally by the North Canadian River, which divides North Oklahoma City and South Oklahoma City. The north side is characterized by diverse and fashionable urban neighborhoods near the city center and sprawling suburbs further north. South Oklahoma City is generally more blue-collar working class and significantly more industrial, having grown up around the Stockyards and meat packing plants at the turn of the century. It is also the center of the city's rapidly growing Latino community.

[[Downtown Oklahoma City]], which has 7,600 residents, is seeing an influx of new private investment and large-scale public works projects, which have helped to revitalize a central business district left almost deserted by the Oil Bust of the early 1980s. The centerpiece of downtown is the newly renovated Crystal Bridge and Myriad Botanical Gardens, one of the few elements of the [[Pei Plan]] to be completed. In 2021, a massive new central park will link the gardens near the CBD and the new convention center to be built just south of it to the North Canadian River as part of a massive works project known as "Core to Shore"; the new park is part of MAPS3, a collection of civic projects funded by a one-cent temporary (seven-year) sales tax increase.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.okc.gov/government/maps-3/projects/downtown-public-park|title=Scissortail Park &#124; City of OKC|website=Okc.gov}}</ref>

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Oklahoma City}}
Oklahoma City has a temperate [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen]]: Cfa), along with significant continental influences. The city features hot, humid summers and cool winters. Prolonged and severe droughts (sometimes leading to wildfires in the vicinity) and hefty rainfall leading to flash flooding and flooding occur regularly. Consistent winds, usually from the south or south-southeast during the summer, help temper the hotter weather. Consistent northerly winds during the winter can intensify cold periods. Severe [[ice storm]]s and [[snowstorm]]s happen sporadically during the winter.

The average temperature is {{convert|61.4|°F}}, with the monthly daily average ranging from {{convert|39.2|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|83.0|°F|1}} in July. Extremes range from {{convert|-17|F|0}} on [[Great Blizzard of 1899|February 12, 1899]] to {{convert|113|F|0}} on August 11, 1936, and [[Summer 2012 North American heat wave|August 3, 2012]];<ref>[http://www.weather.gov/oun/climate-records "Climatological averages and records"] [[National Weather Service|NWS]] Norman, Oklahoma.

====Extreme weather====
Oklahoma City has an active severe weather season from March through June, especially during April and May. Being in the center of what is colloquially referred to as [[Tornado Alley]], it is prone to widespread and severe tornadoes, as well as severe [[hail]]storms and occasional [[derecho]]es. Tornadoes occur every month of the year, and a secondary smaller peak also occurs during autumn, especially in October. The Oklahoma City metropolitan area is one of the most tornado-prone major cities in the world, with about 150 tornadoes striking within the city limits since 1890. Since the time weather records have been kept, Oklahoma City has been struck by 13 violent tornadoes, eleven rated F/EF4 and two rated F/EF5.<ref name="OKC Tor2"/>

On [[1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak|May 3, 1999]], parts of Oklahoma City and surrounding communities were impacted by a tornado. It was the last U.S. tornado to be given a rating of F5 on the [[Fujita scale]] before the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]] replaced it in 2007.

[[File:Flickr - Nicholas T - Skyline.jpg|thumb|Old Interstate 40 Crosstown, Oklahoma City]]
Oklahoma City is the principal city of the eight-county Oklahoma City metropolitan statistical Area in [[Central Oklahoma]] and is the state's largest urbanized area. As of 2015, the metro area was the [[List of metropolitan statistical areas|41st largest in the nation]] based on population.<ref name=bmark>{{cite web|title=Results|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/metro/totals/2015/index.html|website=American Factfinder|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=March 24, 2016}} {{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=Balon Greyjoy |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

===Crime===

Law enforcement claims Oklahoma City has traditionally been the territory of the notorious [[Juárez Cartel]], but the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] has been reported as trying to establish a foothold in Oklahoma City. There are many rival gangs in Oklahoma City, one whose headquarters has been established in the city, the Southside Locos, traditionally known as [[Sureños]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsok.com/narcotics-agents-arrest-suspected-cartel-member-in-oklahoma-city/article/3472186?custom_click=lead_story_title |title=Narcotics agents arrest suspected cartel member in Oklahoma City |publisher=Newsok.com |date=June 29, 2010 |access-date=February 15, 2012 |archive-date=May 15, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515214044/http://newsok.com/narcotics-agents-arrest-suspected-cartel-member-in-oklahoma-city/article/3472186?custom_click=lead_story_title |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Oklahoma City also has its share of violent crimes, particularly in the 1970s. The worst occurred in 1978 when six employees of a Sirloin Stockade restaurant on the city's south side were murdered execution-style in the restaurant's freezer. An intensive investigation followed, and the three individuals involved, who also killed three others in [[Purcell, Oklahoma]], were identified. One, Harold Stafford, died in a motorcycle accident in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] not long after the restaurant murders. Another, Verna Stafford, was sentenced to life without parole after being granted a new trial after she had been sentenced to death. [[Roger Dale Stafford]], considered the mastermind of the murder spree, was executed by lethal injection at the [[Oklahoma State Penitentiary]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stover|first=Jean|title=Sirloin Stockade Slaughter: Murder on the Run|year=2009|publisher=Eloquent Books|location=Durham, Connecticut|isbn=978-1-60860-924-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MiOLvihIQZ4C&q=six+employees+of+a+Sirloin+Stockade%2C+oklahoma+city&pg=PA83}}</ref>

On April 19, 1995, the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]] was destroyed by a fertilizer bomb manufactured and detonated by [[Timothy McVeigh]]. The blast and catastrophic collapse killed 168 people and injured over 680. The blast shock-wave destroyed or damaged 324 buildings within a 340-meter radius, destroyed or burned 86 cars, and shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings, causing at least an estimated $652 million. McVeigh was convicted and subsequently executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001.

Business and entertainment districts (and, to a lesser extent, local neighborhoods) tend to maintain their boundaries and character by applying zoning regulations and business improvement districts (districts where property owners agree to a property tax surcharge to support additional services for the community).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.okc.gov/planning/b_i_d/index.html | publisher=The City of Oklahoma City | title=Business Improvement Districts | access-date=November 29, 2014 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218203951/http://www.okc.gov/planning/b_i_d/index.html | archive-date=December 18, 2014 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Through zoning regulations, historic districts, and other special zoning districts, including overlay districts, are well established.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.okc.gov/planning/SpecialZoningDistricts%20rev3HR.pdf |publisher=City of Oklahoma City |title=Special Zoning District Map |access-date=November 29, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218210424/https://www.okc.gov/planning/SpecialZoningDistricts%20rev3HR.pdf |archive-date=December 18, 2014 }}</ref> Oklahoma City has three business improvement districts, including one encompassing the [[Downtown Oklahoma City|central business district]].

==Sports==
{{main|Sports in Oklahoma City}}
[[File:AT&T Ballpark.jpg|thumb|[[Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark]], home of the [[Oklahoma City Comets]]]]

Oklahoma City is home to several professional sports teams, including the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] of the [[National Basketball Association]]. The Thunder is the city's second "permanent" major professional sports franchise after the now-defunct [[Arena Football League|AFL]] [[Oklahoma Wranglers]]. It is the third major-league team to call the city home when considering the temporary hosting of the [[New Orleans Pelicans|New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets]] for the 2005–06 and 2006–07 NBA seasons. However, the [[Oklahoma City Thunder|Thunder]] was formerly the [[Seattle SuperSonics|Sonics]] before the [[Seattle SuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City|movement of the Sonics to OKC in 2008.]]

Other professional sports clubs in Oklahoma City include the [[Oklahoma City Comets]], the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] affiliate of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], the [[Oklahoma City Energy FC]] of the [[United Soccer League]], and the Crusaders of Oklahoma Rugby Football Club of [[USA Rugby]]. The Oklahoma City Blazers, a name used for decades of the city's hockey team in the [[Central Hockey League]], has been used for [[Oklahoma City Jr. Blazers|a junior team]] in the [[Western States Hockey League]] since 2014.

The [[Paycom Center]] in [[Downtown Oklahoma City|downtown]] is the main multipurpose arena in the city, which hosts concerts, [[National Hockey League|NHL]] exhibition games, and many of the city's pro sports teams. In 2008, the Oklahoma City Thunder became the primary tenant. Nearby in Bricktown, the [[Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark]] is the home to the city's baseball team, the Comets. "The Brick", as it is locally known, is considered one of the finest minor league parks in the nation.<ref>Michael Davis in ''[https://stadiumjourney.com/stadiums/chickasaw-bricktown-ballpark-s282 Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark-Oklahoma City Dodgers]'' 29 September 2019</ref>

Oklahoma City hosts the [[World Cup of Softball]] and the annual NCAA Women's College World Series. The city has held 2005 [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Men's Basketball]] [[2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament#Chicago Regional|First]] and [[2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament#Chicago Regional 2|Second round]] and hosted the [[2007 Big 12 men's basketball tournament|Big 12]] Men's and women's basketball tournaments in 2007 and 2009. The major universities in the area – [[University of Oklahoma]], [[Oklahoma City University]], and [[Oklahoma State University–Stillwater|Oklahoma State University]] – often schedule major basketball games and other sporting events at [[Paycom Center]] and Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark. However, most home games are played at their campus stadiums.

Other major sporting events include Thoroughbred and Quarter Horse racing circuits at [[Remington Park]] and numerous [[horse show]]s and equine events that take place at the state fairgrounds each year. There are multiple golf courses and country clubs spread around the city.

===High school football===
The state of Oklahoma hosts a highly competitive high school football culture, with many teams in the [[Oklahoma City metropolitan area]]. The Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association (OSSAA) organizes high school football into eight distinct classes based on school enrollment size. Beginning with the largest, the classes are 6A, 5A, 4A, 3A, 2A, A, B, and C. Class 6A is broken into two divisions. Oklahoma City schools in include: Westmoore, Putnam City North, Putnam City, Putnam City West, Southeast, Capitol Hill, U.S. Grant, and Northwest Classen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ossaaonline.com/docs/2013-14/Football/FB_1415_1516_Classifications-3.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 1, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806211705/http://www.ossaaonline.com/docs/2013-14/Football/FB_1415_1516_Classifications-3.pdf |archive-date=August 6, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Oklahoma City Thunder===

The [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) has called Oklahoma City home since the [[2008–09 NBA season|2008–09 season]], when owner [[Clay Bennett (businessman)|Clay Bennett]] relocated the franchise from [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The Thunder plays home games in downtown Oklahoma City at the [[Paycom Center]]. The Thunder is known by several nicknames, including "OKC Thunder" and simply "OKC", and its mascot is [[Rumble the Bison]].

After arriving in Oklahoma City for the 2008–09 season, the Oklahoma City Thunder secured a berth (8th) in the [[2010 NBA Playoffs]] the following year after boasting its first 50-win season, winning two games in the first round against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. In 2012, Oklahoma City made it to the [[2012 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] but lost to the [[Miami Heat]] in five games. In 2013, the Thunder reached the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] semi-finals without [[NBA All-Star|All-Star]] guard [[Russell Westbrook]], who was injured in their first-round series against the [[Houston Rockets]], only to lose to the [[Memphis Grizzlies]]. In 2014, Oklahoma City reached the NBA's Western Conference Finals again but eventually lost to the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in six games.

Sports analysts have regarded the Oklahoma City Thunder as one of the elite franchises of the NBA's Western Conference and a media darling of the league's future. Oklahoma City earned [[Northwest Division (NBA)|Northwest Division]] titles every year from 2011 to 2014 and again in 2016 and has consistently improved its win record to 59 wins in 2014. The Thunder is led by third-year head coach [[Mark Daigneault]] and was anchored by All-Star point guard Russell Westbrook before a July 2019 trade that sent him to the Houston Rockets.

===Hornets===
{{Main|Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans Hornets}}
In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], the NBA's New Orleans Hornets temporarily relocated to the [[Ford Center (Oklahoma City)|Ford Center]], playing the majority of its home games there during the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. The team became the first NBA franchise to play regular-season games in Oklahoma.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The team was known as the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets while playing in Oklahoma City.
The team returned to New Orleans full-time for the 2007–08 season. The Hornets played their final home game in Oklahoma City during the exhibition season on October 9, 2007, against the [[Houston Rockets]].

===2028 Olympics===

Venues in Oklahoma City will host two events during the [[2028 Summer Olympics]], which will primarily be held in [[Los Angeles]]. The LA Olympic Organizing Committee opted to have [[canoe slalom]] and [[softball]] in Oklahoma City, given the lack of acceptable venues for those sports in Los Angeles. Riversport OKC will host the canoe slalom competition, while [[Devon Park (stadium)|Devon Park]] will host the softball competition. Oklahoma City is located approximately 1,300 miles away from Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news |date=June 22, 2024 |title=Oklahoma City to host softball, canoe slalom during the 2028 Los Angeles Games |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/oklahoma-city-host-softball-canoe-slalom-2028-los-angeles-games-rcna158450 |work=[[NBC News]] |accessdate=August 11, 2024}}</ref>

==Parks and recreation==
[[File:Myriad Botanical Gardens.jpg|right|thumb|Myriad Botanical Gardens, the centerpiece of downtown OKC's central business district]]

I also reorganized the content of the section for flow as it was previously hodge podge. Please enhance as there have been massive additions to this category including Riversports/River District which I don't know much about -->

One of the more prominent landmarks of downtown Oklahoma City is the Crystal Bridge [[tropical]] [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]] at the [[Myriad Botanical Gardens]], a large downtown urban park. Designed by [[I. M. Pei]], the park also includes the Water Stage amphitheater, a bandshell, and lawn, a sunken pond complete with koi, an interactive children's garden complete with a carousel and water sculpture, various trails and interactive exhibits that rotate throughout the year including the ice skating in the Christmas winter season. In 2007, following a renovation of the stage, ''Oklahoma Shakespeare In The Park'' relocated to the Myriad Gardens. Bicentennial Park, also downtown located near the Oklahoma City Civic Center campus, is home to the annual ''Festival of the Arts'' in April.

The Scissortail Park is just south of the Myriad Gardens, a large interactive park that opened in 2021. This park contains a large lake with paddleboats, a dog park, a concert stage with a great lawn, a promenade including the Skydance Bridge, a children's interactive splash park and playground, and numerous athletic facilities. Farmers Market is a common attraction at Scissortail Park during the season, and there are multiple film showings, food trucks, concerts, festivals, and civic gatherings.

Returning to the city's first parks masterplan, Oklahoma City has at least one major park in each quadrant outside downtown. [[Will Rogers Gardens|Will Rogers Park]], the Grand Boulevard loop once connected Lincoln Park, Trosper Park, and Woodson Park, some sections of which no longer exist. Martin Park Nature Center is a natural habitat in far northwest Oklahoma City. Will Rogers Park is home to the ''Lycan Conservatory'', the Rose Garden, and the Butterfly Garden, all built in the WPA era. In April 2005, the ''Oklahoma City Skate Park'' at Wiley Post Park was renamed the ''Mat Hoffman Action Sports Park'' to recognize [[Mat Hoffman]], an Oklahoma City area resident and businessman who was instrumental in the design of the skate park and is a 10-time BMX World Vert champion.<ref name=OKCApril2005Agenda>{{cite web|last=Couch|first=James D|title=Council Agenda Item No. VIII.

Walking trails line the [[Bricktown Canal]] and the [[North Canadian River|Oklahoma River]] in downtown. The city's bike trail system follows around Lake Hefner and Lake Overholser in the northwest and west quadrants of the city. The majority of the east shore area of Lake Hefner is taken up by parks and bike trails, including a new leashless dog park and the postwar-era ''Stars and Stripes Park'', and eateries near the lighthouse. Lake Stanley Draper, in southeast Oklahoma City, is the city's largest and most remote lake, offering a genuine rural yet still urban experience.

<!-- all of the below should be moved to the culture area, not much to do with parks -->
The [[Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden]] is home to numerous natural habitats, [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] era architecture and landscaping, and major touring concerts during the summer at its amphitheater. Nearby is a combination racetrack and casino, [[Remington Park]], which hosts both [[Quarter Horse]] (March – June) and [[Thoroughbred]] (August—December) seasons.

Oklahoma City is also home to the [[American Banjo Museum]], which houses a large collection of highly decorated banjos from the early 20th century and exhibits the banjo's history and its place in American history. Concerts and lectures are also held there.

===Politics===
Similar to many American cities, Oklahoma City is politically [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] in its suburbs and [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] in the central city. In the [[United States House of Representatives]], it is represented by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] [[Stephanie Bice]] and [[Tom Cole]] of the 5th and 4th districts, respectively. The city has called on residents to vote for sales tax-based projects to revitalize parts of the city. The [[Bricktown, Oklahoma City|Bricktown]] district is the best example of such an initiative. In the recent [[Metropolitan Area Projects Plan 3|MAPS 3]] vote, the city's fraternal police order criticized the project proposals for not doing enough to expand the police presence to keep up with the growing residential population and increased commercial activity. In September 2013, Oklahoma City area attorney David Slane announced he would pursue legal action regarding MAPS3 on claims the multiple projects that made up the plan violate a state constitutional law limiting voter ballot issues to a single subject.<ref>[http://www.okcfox.com/story/23330885/oklahoma-city-responds-to-david-slanes-challenge-of-maps-3 Oklahoma City responds to David Slane's challenge of MAPS-3], [[KOKH-TV]], September 3, 2013.</ref>

==Media==
{{See also|Media in Oklahoma City}}

===Print===
''[[The Oklahoman]]'' is Oklahoma City's major daily newspaper and is the most widely circulated in the state. NewsOK.com is the Oklahoman's online presence. ''Oklahoma Gazette'' is Oklahoma City's independent newsweekly, featuring such staples as local commentary, feature stories, restaurant reviews, movie listings, and music and entertainment. ''The Journal Record'' is the city's daily business newspaper, and ''okcBIZ'' is a monthly publication that covers business news affecting those who live and work in Central Oklahoma.

Numerous community and international newspapers cater to the city's ethnic mosaic, such as ''[[Black Chronicle|The Black Chronicle]]'', headquartered in the [[Eastside, Oklahoma City|Eastside]], the OK VIETIMES and ''Oklahoma Chinese Times'', in [[Asia District, Oklahoma City|Asia District]], and various Hispanic community publications. ''The Campus'' is the student newspaper at Oklahoma City University. Gay publications include ''The Gayly Oklahoman''.

An upscale lifestyle publication called ''405 Magazine'' (formerly Slice Magazine) is circulated throughout the metropolitan area.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.405magazine.com/about-us/| title=About 405 Magazine|publisher=405 Magazine|access-date=March 15, 2020}}</ref>  In addition, there is a magazine published by ''Back40 Design Group'' called ''The Edmond Outlook''. It contains local commentary and human interest pieces directly mailed to over 50,000 Edmond residents.

''[[Ready Player One]]'' is set in Oklahoma City in the year 2045.

===Broadcast===
Oklahoma City was home to several pioneers in radio and television broadcasting. Oklahoma City's [[WKY]] Radio was the first radio station transmitting west of the [[Mississippi River]] and the third radio station in the United States.<ref name="states1">[http://www.50states.com/facts/okla.htm Oklahoma Fast Facts and Trivia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421201401/http://www.50states.com/facts/okla.htm |date=April 21, 2009 }}. Retrieved January 26, 2009.</ref> WKY received its federal license in 1921 and has continually broadcast under the same call letters since 1922. In 1928, WKY was purchased by [[Edward K. Gaylord|E.K. Gaylord]]'s Oklahoma Publishing Company and affiliated with the [[NBC Red Network]]; in 1949, WKY-TV (channel 4) went on the air and later became the first independently owned television station in the U.S. to broadcast in color.<ref name="states1"/> In mid-2002, WKY radio was purchased outright by [[Citadel Broadcasting]], who was bought out by [[Cumulus Broadcasting]] in 2011. The Gaylord family earlier sold WKY-TV in 1976, which has gone through a succession of owners (what is now [[KFOR-TV]] is owned by [[Nexstar Media Group]] as of October 2019).

The major U.S. broadcast television networks have [[network affiliate|affiliates]] in the Oklahoma City [[media market|market]] (ranked 41st for television by [[Nielsen Media Research|Nielsen]] and 48th for radio by [[Arbitron]], covering a 34-county area serving the central, north-central and west-central sections of Oklahoma); including [[NBC]] affiliate KFOR-TV (channel 4), [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[KOCO-TV]] (channel 5), [[CBS]] affiliate [[KWTV-DT]] (channel 9, the [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] of locally based [[Griffin Media]]), [[PBS]] station KETA-TV (channel 13, the flagship of the state-run [[Oklahoma Educational Television Authority|OETA]] member network), [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[KOKH-TV]] (channel 25), [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[KOCB]] (channel 34), [[The CW|CW]] [[owned-and-operated station]] [[KAUT-TV]] (channel 43), [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate [[KSBI|KSBI-TV]] (channel 52), and [[Ion Television]] affiliate [[KOPX-TV]] (channel 62). The market is also home to several religious stations, including [[Trinity Broadcasting Network|TBN]] owned-and-operated station [[KTBO-TV]] (channel 14) and Norman-based [[Daystar (TV network)|Daystar]] owned-and-operated station [[KOCM]] (channel 46).

Despite the market's geographical size, none of the English-language commercial affiliates in the Oklahoma City designated market area operate full-power satellite stations covering the far northwestern part of the state (requiring cable or satellite to view them). However, KFOR-TV, KOCO-TV, KWTV-DT, and KOKH-TV each operate low-power translators in that portion of the market. Oklahoma City is one of the few markets between Chicago and Dallas to have affiliates of two or more of the significant Spanish-language broadcast networks: [[Telemundo]] affiliate [[KTUZ-TV]] (channel 30), [[Woodward, Oklahoma|Woodward]]-based [[Univision]]/[[UniMás]] affiliate [[KUOK]] 35 (whose translator KUOK-CD, channel 36, serves the immediate Oklahoma City area), and [[Estrella TV]] affiliate [[KOCY-LD]] (channel 48). (Locally based [[Tyler Media Group]], which owns the three stations above, also owns eight radio stations in the market, including [[Regional Mexican]]-formatted [[KTUZ-FM]] (106.7) and news–talk outlet [[KOKC (AM)|KOKC]] (1520 AM).)

===Transportation===
{{Main|Transportation in Oklahoma City}}

====Highway====
Oklahoma City is an integral point on the [[Interstate Highway System|United States Interstate Network]], with three major interstate highways – [[Interstate 35 in Oklahoma|Interstate 35]], [[Interstate 40 in Oklahoma|Interstate 40]], and [[Interstate 44 in Oklahoma|Interstate 44]] – bisecting the city. [[Interstate 240 (Oklahoma)|Interstate 240]] connects [[Interstate 40 in Oklahoma|Interstate 40]] and [[Interstate 44 in Oklahoma|Interstate 44]] in south Oklahoma City. At the same time, [[Interstate 235 (Oklahoma)|Interstate 235]] spurs from Interstate 44 in north-central Oklahoma City into downtown. Interstate 44, between NW 23rd St and NW 36th St, is the busiest roadway in the city and state, with an average daily traffic count of 167,200 vehicles per day in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018 |title=Metro Areas |url=https://www.odot.org/maps/aadt/2018/UrbanMap_MetroAreas.pdf |website=odot.org}}</ref>

Major state expressways through the city include Lake Hefner Parkway ([[Oklahoma State Highway 74|SH-74]]), the [[John Kilpatrick Turnpike|Kilpatrick Turnpike]], Airport Road ([[Oklahoma State Highway 152|SH-152]]), and [[U.S. Route 77 in Oklahoma|Broadway Extension]] ([[U.S. Route 77 in Oklahoma|US-77]]) which continues from I-235 connecting Central Oklahoma City to Edmond. Lake Hefner Parkway runs through northwest Oklahoma City, while Airport Road runs through southwest Oklahoma City and leads to [[Will Rogers World Airport]]. The Kilpatrick Turnpike loops around north and west Oklahoma City.

Oklahoma City also has several major national and state highways within its city limits. Shields Boulevard (US-77) continues from E.K. Gaylord Boulevard in downtown Oklahoma City and runs south, eventually connecting to I-35 near the suburb of [[Moore, Oklahoma]]. Northwest Expressway (Oklahoma State Highway 3) runs from North Classen Boulevard in north-central Oklahoma City to the northwestern suburbs.

The following significant expressways traverse Oklahoma City:
* [[Interstate 35 in Oklahoma|Interstate 35]] 
* [[Interstate 40 in Oklahoma|Interstate 40]] (Crosstown Expressway, Stanley Draper Expressway, Tinker Diagonal, Tom Stead Memorial Highway)
* [[Interstate 44 in Oklahoma|Interstate 44]] (Turner Turnpike, Belle Isle Freeway, Will Rogers Expressway, H.E. Bailey Turnpike)
* [[Interstate 235 in Oklahoma|Interstate 235]] (Centennial Expressway) / [[U.S. Route 77 in Oklahoma|U.S. 77]] (Broadway Extension)

* [[Oklahoma State Highway 74|Lake Hefner Parkway]] (State Highway 74)
* [[Oklahoma State Highway 152|Airport Road]] (State Highway 152)
* [[Kilpatrick Turnpike]]

====Air====
Oklahoma City is served by two primary airports, [[Will Rogers World Airport]] and the much smaller [[Wiley Post Airport]] (incidentally, the two honorees died in the same plane crash in [[Alaska]])<ref>"[http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Explorers_Record_Setters_and_Daredevils/Wiley_Post/EX27.htm Wiley Post]", {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008043851/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Explorers_Record_Setters_and_Daredevils/Wiley_Post/EX27.htm |date=October 8, 2012 }}, U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission.

Retrieved January 12, 2018.</ref>

[[Tinker Air Force Base]], in southeast Oklahoma City, is the largest military air depot in the nation. It is a major maintenance and deployment facility for the [[United States Navy|Navy]] and the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] and the second largest military institution in the state (after [[Fort Sill]] in [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]]).

[[File:UnitedKOKC.jpg|thumb|right|United Airlines Embraer 170 aircraft at the East Concourse of Will Rogers World Airport]]

====Rail and intercity bus====
[[Amtrak]] has a station downtown at the [[Santa Fe Depot (Oklahoma City)|Santa Fe Depot]], with daily service to [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] and the nation's rail network via the [[Heartland Flyer]]. Oklahoma City once was the crossroads of several interstate passenger railroads at the Santa Fe Depot, the Union Station, and the [[Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad]] station.<ref>'Official Guide of the Railways,' 1949 Index of Stations</ref> But service at that level has long since been discontinued. However, several proposals to extend the current train service have been made, including a plan to expand the Heartland Flyer to [[Newton, Kansas]], which is currently being connected through [[Amtrak Thruway]]. Freight service is provided by [[BNSF Railway]], [[Union Pacific Railroad]], and Stillwater Central.

[[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] and several other [[Intercity bus service|intercity bus]] companies serve Oklahoma City at the [[Union Station (Oklahoma City)|Union Bus Station]] in downtown.

====Public transit====
{{Main|Embark (transit authority)|Oklahoma City Streetcar}}
[[File:Oklahoma City Streetcar - green car on 4th Street passing First United Methodist Church.jpg|thumb|right|Streetcar of the OKC Streetcar system passing the historic First United Methodist Church, in downtown]]
[[Embark (transit authority)|Embark (formerly Metro Transit)]] is the city's public transit company. The primary transfer terminal is downtown at NW 5th Street and Hudson Avenue. Embark maintains limited coverage of the city's primary street grid using a [[Spoke-hub distribution paradigm|hub-and-spoke system]] from the main terminal, making many journeys impractical due to the relatively small number of bus routes offered and that most trips require a transfer downtown. The city has recognized transit as a significant issue for the rapidly growing and urbanizing city. It has initiated several recent studies to improve the existing bus system, starting with a plan known as the Fixed Guideway Study.<ref>[http://www.okfgs.org/ Oklahoma Fixed Guideway Study] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605085756/http://www.okfgs.org/ |date=June 5, 2010 }} (Retrieved April 21, 2010)</ref> This study identified several potential commuter transit routes from the suburbs into downtown OKC as well as feeder-line bus and/or rail routes throughout the city.

Though Oklahoma City has no [[light rail]] or [[commuter rail]] service, city residents identified improved transit as one of their top priorities. From the fruits of the Fixed Guideway and other studies, city leaders strongly desire to incorporate urban rail transit into the region's future transportation plans. The greater Oklahoma City metropolitan transit plan identified from the Fixed Guideway Study includes a [[tram|streetcar system]] in the downtown area, to be fed by enhanced city bus service and commuter rail from the suburbs including [[Edmond, Oklahoma|Edmond]], [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]], and [[Midwest City, Oklahoma|Midwest City]]. There is a significant push for a commuter rail line connecting downtown OKC with the eastern suburbs of [[Del City, Oklahoma|Del City]], [[Midwest City, Oklahoma|Midwest City]], and [[Tinker Air Force Base]]. In addition to commuter rail, a short heritage rail line that would run from Bricktown just a few blocks away from the Amtrak station to the [[Adventure District]] in northeast Oklahoma City is under reconstruction.

In December 2009, Oklahoma City voters passed [[Metropolitan Area Projects Plan 3|MAPS 3]], the $777&nbsp;million (7-year, 1-cent tax) initiative. This initiative would generate funding (approx. $130&nbsp;million) for the modern [[Oklahoma City Streetcar]] system in downtown Oklahoma City and the establishment of a transit hub.

On September 10, 2013, the federal government announced that Oklahoma City would receive a $13.8-million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation's [[Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery|TIGER program]]. This was the first-ever grant for Oklahoma City for a rail-based initiative and is thought to be a turning point for city leaders who have applied for grants in the past, only to be denied continuously. It is believed the city will use the TIGER grant along with approximately $10&nbsp; million from the MAPS 3 Transit budget to revitalize the city's Amtrak station, becoming an Intermodal Transportation Hub, taking over the role of the existing transit hub at NW 5th/Hudson Ave.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}
