'''Birmingham''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɜr|m|ɪ|ŋ|h|æ|m}} {{Respell|BUR|ming-ham}}) is a city in the north central region of [[Alabama]]. Birmingham is the [[county seat]] of [[Jefferson County, Alabama|Jefferson County]], Alabama's most populous county. As of the 2023 census estimates, Birmingham had a population of 196,910 down 2% from the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]],<ref name=quickfacts/> making it Alabama's second-most populous city after [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]].{{efn|Prior to the 2020 census, Birmingham was the most populous city in Alabama.}} The broader [[Birmingham metropolitan area, Alabama|Birmingham metropolitan area]] had a 2020 population of 1,115,289,<ref name="2020Pop" /> and is the largest metropolitan area in Alabama as well as the [[List of metropolitan statistical areas|47th-most populous]] in the United States. Birmingham serves as an important regional hub and is associated with the [[Deep South]], [[Piedmont Atlantic Megaregion|Piedmont]], and [[Appalachia]]n regions of the nation.

Birmingham was founded in 1871, during the post–[[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction period]], through the merger of three pre-existing farm towns, notably, [[Elyton, Alabama|Elyton]]. It grew from there, [[annexation|annexing]] many more of its smaller neighbors, into an industrial and [[rail transportation|railroad transportation]] center with a focus on mining, the [[steel|iron and steel industry]], and [[railroading]]. Birmingham was named after [[Birmingham]] in [[Warwickshire]], [[England]], one of the [[UK]]'s major industrial cities. Most of the original settlers who founded Birmingham were of [[English American|English ancestry]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Pickett |first=Albert James |title=History of Alabama, and Incidentally of Georgia and Mississippi, from the Earliest Period|orig-year=1851 |year=2003 |publisher=River City Publishing |location=Montgomery, Ala. |isbn=978-1880216705 |url=http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~cmamcrk4/pktfm.html |author2=Owen, Thomas McAdory |volume=1 |page=391 |access-date=July 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722014625/http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~cmamcrk4/pktfm.html |archive-date=July 22, 2012}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=3H0FAAAAQAAJ Alt URL]</ref> The city may have been planned as a place where cheap, non-unionized, and often African-American labor from rural Alabama could be employed in the city's steel mills and blast furnaces, giving it a competitive advantage over industrial cities in the [[Midwest]] and [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]].<ref>The Most Segregated City in America: City Planning and Civil Rights in Birmingham, 1920–1980, p. 14.</ref>

From its founding through the end of the 1960s, Birmingham was a primary industrial center of the [[Southern United States|South]]. The pace of Birmingham's growth during the period from 1881 through 1920 earned its nicknames ''The Magic City'' and ''The Pittsburgh of the South''. Much like [[Pittsburgh]], Birmingham's major industries were iron and steel production, plus a major component of the [[railroading]] industry, where rails and railroad cars were both manufactured in Birmingham. In the field of railroading, the two primary hubs of railroading in the Deep South were nearby [[Atlanta]] and Birmingham, beginning in the 1860s and continuing through to the present day. The economy diversified during the later half of the twentieth century. Though the manufacturing industry maintains a strong presence in Birmingham, other businesses and industries such as [[banking]], [[telecommunications]], transportation, electrical power transmission, medical care, [[college education]], and insurance have risen in stature. Mining in the Birmingham area is no longer a major industry with the exception of coal mining. Birmingham ranks as one of the most important business centers in the Southeastern United States and is also one of the largest banking centers in the United States. In addition, the Birmingham area serves as headquarters to two [[Fortune 500]] companies: [[Regions Financial]] and [[Vulcan Materials Company]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.alreporter.com/2023/06/13/two-alabama-companies-make-fortune-500/#:~:text=Birmingham%2Dbased%20Vulcan%20Materials%20Company,first%20year%20on%20the%20list | title=Two Alabama companies make Fortune 500 | date=June 13, 2023 }}</ref> along with multiple other [[Fortune 1000]] companies.

In [[higher education]], Birmingham has been the location of the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine]] (formerly the Medical College of Alabama) and the [[UAB School of Dentistry|University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Dentistry]] since 1947. In 1969 the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] was established, one of three main campuses of the [[University of Alabama System]]. Birmingham is also home to two private institutions: [[Samford University]] and [[Miles College]]. Birmingham was also home to [[Birmingham–Southern College|Birmingham-Southern College]], before its closure in 2024. Between these colleges and universities, the Birmingham area has major colleges of medicine, dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, law, engineering, and nursing. Birmingham is also the headquarters of the [[Southeastern Conference]], one of the major U.S. collegiate athletic conferences.

==History==
{{For timeline}}

===Founding and early growth===
[[File:OUR BABY DOFFER.jpg|thumb|right|Child labor at Avondale Mills in Birmingham, 1910, photo by [[Lewis Hine]]]]

Birmingham was founded on June 1, 1871, by the Elyton Land Company whose investors included cotton planters, bankers and railroad entrepreneurs. It sold lots near the planned crossing of the [[Alabama Great Southern Railroad#History|Alabama & Chattanooga]] and [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad|South & North Alabama]] railroads, including land formerly a part of the Benjamin P. Worthington plantation. The first business at that crossroads was the trading post and country store operated by Marre & Allen. The site of the railroad crossing was notable for the nearby deposits of iron ore, coal, and [[limestone]]&nbsp;– the three main raw materials used in making steel.

Birmingham is the only place worldwide where significant amounts of all three minerals can be found in close proximity.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1597 |title=Birmingham Iron and Steel companies |last=Lewis |first=David |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Alabama |access-date=August 19, 2011 |archive-date=November 5, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105154141/http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1597 |url-status=dead }}</ref> From the start the new city was planned as a great center of industry. The founders, organized as the Elyton Land Company, borrowed the name of Birmingham, one of England's main industrial cities, to advertise that point. The growth of the planned city was impeded by an outbreak of [[cholera]] and a [[Wall Street]] crash in 1873. However, it began to develop shortly afterward at an explosive rate.

In 1911, the town of Elyton, Alabama, and several other surrounding towns were absorbed into Birmingham. The start of the 20th century brought the substantial growth that gave Birmingham the nickname "The Magic City", as the downtown area developed from a low-rise commercial and residential district into a busy grid of neoclassical mid-rise and high-rise buildings and busy streetcar lines. Between 1902 and 1912 four large office buildings were constructed at the intersection of 20th Street, the central north–south spine of the city, and 1st Avenue North, which connected the warehouses and industrial facilities stretching along the east–west railroad corridor. This impressive group of early skyscrapers was nicknamed "The [[Heaviest Corner on Earth]]".

In 1916, Birmingham was hit by the [[1916 Irondale earthquake|Irondale earthquake]], with a 5.1 magnitude. A few buildings in the area were slightly damaged. The earthquake was felt as far as Atlanta and neighboring states.

While excluded from the best-paying industrial jobs, Black Americans joined the migration of residents from rural areas to the city for its opportunities. The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s hit Birmingham especially hard as sources of capital that were fueling the city's growth rapidly dried up at the same time that farm laborers, driven off the land, made their way to the city in search of work. [[New Deal]] programs put many city residents to work in WPA and CCC programs, making important contributions to the city's infrastructure and artistic legacy, including such key improvements as [[Vulcan statue|Vulcan's]] tower and [[Oak Mountain State Park]].

The wartime demand for steel and the post-war building boom gave Birmingham a rapid return to prosperity. Manufacturing diversified beyond the production of raw materials. Major civic institutions such as schools, parks and museums, were able to expand their scope.<ref name=Atkins-1981>{{cite book |title=The Valley and the Hills: An Illustrated History of Birmingham & Jefferson County |last=Atkins |first=Leah Rawls |year=1981 |publisher=Windsor Publications |isbn=978-0-89781-031-9}}</ref>

Despite the growing population and wealth of the city, its residents were markedly underrepresented in the state legislature. Although the state constitution required redistricting in accordance with changes in the decennial census, the state legislature did not undertake this until the early 1970s, when forced by a federal court case to enforce "[[one man, one vote]]". In addition, the geographic basis of the senate, which gave each county one seat, gave undue influence to rural counties. Representatives of rural counties also had disproportionate power in the state house, and failed to provide support for infrastructure and other improvements in developing urban population centers such as Birmingham. At this time, the General Assembly ran county governments as extensions of the state through their legislative delegations.

===Birmingham civil rights movement===
{{Main|Birmingham campaign}}

In the 1950s and 1960s Birmingham received national and international attention as a center of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|civil rights struggle]] for African-Americans. Locally the movement's activists were led by [[Fred Shuttlesworth]], a fiery preacher who became legendary for his fearlessness in the face of violence, notably a string of racially motivated bombings that earned Birmingham the derisive nickname "Bombingham".<ref>{{cite news |last=Cohen |first=Adam |title=Back to 'Bombingham' |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986714,00.html |date=July 21, 1997 |access-date=April 26, 2010 |archive-date=October 27, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027071848/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986714,00.html |url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:16th Street Baptist Church.JPG|thumb|The [[16th Street Baptist Church]], now a National Historic Landmark]]
A watershed in the civil rights movement occurred in 1963 when Shuttlesworth requested that [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), which Shuttlesworth had co-founded, come to Birmingham, where King had once been a pastor, to help end segregation.<ref name="test">[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2010/4/2010_4_90.shtml Clayborne Carson]{{Dead link|date=January 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} "King Maker", ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'', Winter 2010.</ref> Together they launched "Project C" (for "Confrontation"), a massive assault on the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow system]]. In April and May daily sit-ins and mass marches organized and led by movement leader [[James Bevel]] were met with police repression, [[tear gas]], attack dogs, fire hoses, and arrests. More than 3,000 people were arrested during these protests, almost all of them high-school age children. These protests were ultimately successful, leading not only to desegregation of public accommodations in Birmingham but also the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Civil Rights Movement Veterans |title=The Birmingham Campaign |url=http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis63.htm#1963bham |date= |access-date=}}</ref>

While imprisoned for having taken part in a nonviolent protest, Dr. King wrote the now famous April 16 [[Letter from Birmingham Jail]], a defining treatise in his cause against segregation. Birmingham is also known for the September 15 incident, in which four black girls were killed by a bomb planted at the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|16th Street Baptist Church]]. The event would inspire the African-American poet [[Dudley Randall]]'s opus, "[[The Ballad of Birmingham]]", as well as jazz musician [[John Coltrane]]'s song "Alabama".

In 1998 the Birmingham Pledge, written by local attorney James Rotch, was introduced at the Martin Luther King Unity Breakfast. As a grassroots community commitment to combating racism and prejudice, it has since then been used for programs in all fifty states and in more than twenty countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1884 |title=encyclopediaofalabama.org |publisher=encyclopediaofalabama.org |date=May 12, 2011 |access-date=July 14, 2012 |archive-date=October 2, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002093630/http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1884 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Recent history===
In the 1970s, urban-renewal efforts focused around the development of the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]], which developed into a major medical and research center. In 1971, Birmingham celebrated its [[centennial]] with a round of public-works improvements, including an upgrade of [[Vulcan statue|Vulcan Park]] and the construction of a major downtown convention center containing a 2,500-seat symphony hall, theater, 19,000-seat arena, and exhibition halls. Birmingham's banking institutions enjoyed considerable growth as well and new skyscrapers started to appear in the city center for the first time since the 1920s. These projects helped diversify the city's economy but did not prevent the exodus of many of the city's residents to nearby independent suburbs. In 1979, Birmingham elected Dr. [[Richard Arrington Jr.]] as its first African-American mayor.

The population inside Birmingham's city limits has fallen over the past few decades, due in large part to "[[white flight]]" from the city of Birmingham proper to surrounding suburbs. The city's formerly most populous ethnic group, non-Hispanic white,<ref name="census2010"/> has declined from 57.4 percent in 1970 to 21.1 percent in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alabama&nbsp;– Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |website=Census.gov |access-date=April 21, 2012}}</ref> From its highest population of 340,887 in 1960, the population was down to 200,733 in 2020, a loss of about 41 percent. That same period saw a corresponding rise in the populations of the suburban communities of Hoover, Vestavia Hills, Alabaster, and Gardendale, none of which were incorporated as municipalities until after 1950.

==Geography and climate==

===Geography===
[[File:CahabaRiverNWR2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cahaba River National Wildlife Refuge]]]]

Birmingham occupies Jones Valley, flanked by long parallel mountain ridges (the tailing ends of the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] foothills&nbsp;– see [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]]) running from north-east to south-west. The valley is drained by small creeks (Village Creek, Valley Creek) which flow into the [[Black Warrior River]]. The valley was bisected by the principal railroad corridor, along which most of the early manufacturing operations began.

[[Red Mountain (Birmingham)|Red Mountain]] lies immediately south of downtown. Many of Birmingham's television and radio broadcast towers are lined up along this prominent ridge. The "Over the Mountain" area, including Shades Valley, [[Shades Mountain]] and beyond, was largely shielded from the industrial smoke and rough streets of the industrial city. This is the setting for Birmingham's more affluent suburbs of [[Mountain Brook, Alabama|Mountain Brook]], [[Vestavia Hills, Alabama|Vestavia Hills]], [[Homewood, Alabama|Homewood]], and [[Hoover, Alabama|Hoover]]. South of Shades Valley is the [[Cahaba River]] basin, one of the most diverse river ecosystems in the United States.

[[Sand Mountain (Alabama)|Sand Mountain]], a smaller ridge, flanks the city to the north and divides Jones Valley from much more rugged land to the north. The [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]] (now [[CSX Transportation]]) enters the valley through Boyles Gap, a prominent gap in the long low ridge.

[[Ruffner Mountain Park|Ruffner Mountain]], located due east of the heart of the city, is home to Ruffner Mountain Nature Center, one of the largest urban nature reserves in the United States.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of {{convert|151.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|149.9|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|2.0|sqmi|km2}} (1.34%) is water.

===Surrounding suburbs===
Most of the metropolitan area lies outside of the city itself. In 2007, the metropolitan area was made up of 7 counties, 102 cities, and 21 school districts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.al.com/birminghamnews/documents/crossroads.pdf |title=Birmingham at a Crossroads |access-date=June 9, 2015 |archive-date=January 15, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115012808/http://www.al.com/birminghamnews/documents/crossroads.pdf |url-status=dead}}</ref> Since then Alabaster and Pelham have broken away from the [[Shelby County Schools (Alabama)|Shelby County School System]] to form their own school systems. Some argue that the region suffers from having so many suburbs because companies can receive large incentives to move a short distance to another city, with no net gain in the area's economy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/comebacktown/2015/06/how_to_extort_money_from_city.html |title=How to extort money from City of Homewood: Reader opinion |date=June 3, 2015 |website=AL.com |access-date=July 21, 2015}}</ref>

===Climate===
Birmingham has a [[humid subtropical climate]], characterized by hot summers, mild winters, and abundant rainfall. January has a daily mean temperature of {{convert|43.8|°F|1}}. There are an average of 47 days annually with a low at or below freezing, and 1.4 days where the high does not surpass freezing.<ref name="NOAA txt">{{cite web |url=https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/services/data/v1?dataset=normals-monthly-1991-2020&startDate=0001-01-01&endDate=9996-12-31&stations=USW00013876&format=pdf |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |title=Station: Birmingham AP, AL |work=U.S. Climate Normals 2020: U.S. Monthly Climate Normals (1991–2020) |access-date=June 7, 2021}}</ref> July has a daily mean temperature of {{convert|81.1|°F|1}}. Highs reach or exceed {{convert|90|°F|0}} on 65 days per year and {{convert|100|°F|0}} on 2.<ref name="NOAA txt"/> Precipitation is relatively well-distributed throughout the year, sometimes falling in the form of snow during winter. {{convert|10.3|in|cm|1}} fell on March 13, 1993, during the [[1993 Storm of the Century]], which established the highest daily snowfall, one-storm, and winter season total on record. Normal snowfall for 1981–2010 was {{convert|1.6|in|cm|1|abbr=on}}. For the same period, the median monthly snowfall for each month was zero.<ref name="NOAA txt"/>

The summer months are hot, with high humidity. Most of the precipitation that falls in the summer are from thunderstorms, most of which occur in the afternoon and evening hours.

The spring and fall months are pleasant but variable as cold fronts frequently bring strong to severe thunderstorms and occasional tornadoes to the region. The fall season (primarily October) features less rainfall and fewer storms, as well as lower humidity than the spring, but November and early December represent a secondary severe weather season. Birmingham is located in the heart of a [[Tornado Alley]] known as the [[Dixie Alley]] due to the high frequency of tornadoes in Central Alabama. The greater Birmingham area has been hit by two F5 tornadoes; one in Birmingham's northern suburbs in [[Birmingham Tornado of April 1977|1977]], and second in the western suburbs in [[Birmingham Tornado of April 1998|1998]]. The area was hit by [[2011 Tuscaloosa–Birmingham tornado|an EF4 tornado]] which was part of a [[April 25–28, 2011 tornado outbreak|larger outbreak in April 2011]]. In late summer and fall months, Birmingham experiences occasional tropical storms and hurricanes due to its proximity to the Central Gulf Coast.

The record high temperature is {{convert|107|°F|0}}, set on July 29, 1930.<ref name="Jul Averages">{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/vacationplanner/wxclimatology/daily/35209?climoMonth=7 |title=July Daily Averages for Birmingham, AL (35209) |publisher=The Weather Channel |access-date=November 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027154130/http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/vacationplanner/wxclimatology/daily/35209?climoMonth=7 |archive-date=October 27, 2012 }}</ref> The record low is {{convert|−10|°F|0}}, set on [[Great Blizzard of 1899|February 13, 1899]].<ref name="Feb Averages">{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/vacationplanner/wxclimatology/daily/35209?climoMonth=2 |title=February Daily Averages for Birmingham, AL (35209) |publisher=weather.com |access-date=April 21, 2014}}</ref>

===Earthquakes===
The Birmingham area is not prone to frequent earthquakes; its historical activity level is 59% less than the US average. Earthquakes are generally minor and the Birmingham area can feel an earthquake from the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone. The magnitude 5.1 Irondale earthquake in 1916 caused damage in the Birmingham area and was felt in the neighboring states and as far as the Carolinas.<ref>{{cite web |title=Historic Earthquakes |url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/events/1916_10_18.php |access-date=November 29, 2012 |archive-date=January 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106010319/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/events/1916_10_18.php |url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[2003 Alabama earthquake]] centered in northeastern Alabama (magnitude 4.6–4.9) was also felt in Birmingham, Atlanta, [[Tennessee]], [[Kentucky]], and both Carolina states.

Birmingham has a strong-mayor variant [[mayor-council government|mayor-council]] form of government, led by a mayor and a nine-member city council. The current system replaced the previous [[city commission government]] in 1962 (primarily as a way to remove Commissioner of Public Safety [[Bull Connor|Eugene "Bull" Connor]] from power).<ref>Nunnelley, William A. (1991) ''Bull Connor''. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press. ISBN 0-8173-0495-9</ref>

By Alabama law, an issue before a city council must be approved by a two-thirds majority vote (Act No. 452, Ala. Acts 1955, as supplemented by Act No. 294, Ala. Acts 1965). Executive powers are held entirely by the Mayor's Office. Birmingham's current mayor is Randall Woodfin. Mayor Bell, who previously served as interim Mayor in 1999, won a special election on January 19, 2010, to fill the unexpired term of former Mayor [[Larry Langford]]. Langford was removed from office after being convicted of federal corruption charges on October 28, 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2007/10/langford_elected_mayor.html |title=Langford elected mayor |work=[[The Birmingham News]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/11/roderick_royal_elected_birming.html |title=Roderick Royal elected Birmingham Council president, and will serve as interim mayor |work=[[The Birmingham News]] |last=Bryant |first=Joseph D. |date=November 24, 2009}}</ref>

In 1974, Birmingham established a structured network of neighborhood associations and community advisory committees to insure public participation in governmental issues that affect neighborhoods. Neighborhood associations are routinely consulted on matters related to zoning changes, liquor licenses, economic development, policing and other city services. Neighborhoods are also granted discretionary funds from the city's budget to use for capital improvements. Each neighborhood's officers meet with their peers to form Community Advisory Committees which are granted broader powers over city departments. The presidents of these committees, in turn, form the Citizen's Advisory Board, which meets regularly with the mayor, council, and department heads. Birmingham is divided into a total of 23 communities, and again into a total of 99 individual neighborhoods with individual neighborhood associations.<ref>Thomson, Ken (1988) "[http://www.cpn.org/topics/community/birmingham.html Birmingham Participation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505101342/http://www.cpn.org/topics/community/birmingham.html |date=May 5, 2009 }}".

==Education==
[[File:Woodlawn High School Birmingham.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Woodlawn High School (Birmingham, Alabama)|Woodlawn High School]], a [[magnet high school]]]]

The Birmingham Public Library administers 21 branches throughout the city and is part of a wider system including another 19 suburban branches in Jefferson County, serving the entire community to provide education and entertainment for all ages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bplonline.org/ |title=Birmingham Public Library |publisher=Bplonline.org |access-date=July 14, 2012 |archive-date=July 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708022702/http://www.bplonline.org/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The city of Birmingham is served by the [[Birmingham City Schools]] system. It is run by the Birmingham Board of Education with a current active enrollment of 30,500 in 62 schools: seven high schools, 13 middle schools, 33 elementary schools, and nine [[kindergarten]]-eighth-grade primary schools.

The greater-Birmingham metropolitan area is the home of numerous independent school systems, because there has a been a great deal of fragmentation of educational systems in Alabama, and especially in Jefferson County. Some of these "school systems" only have three to five schools. The metropolitan area's three largest school systems are the [[Jefferson County Schools (Alabama)|Jefferson County School System]], Birmingham City Schools, and the [[Shelby County Schools (Alabama)|Shelby County School System]]. However, there are many smaller school systems.

The metro area also has three preparatory schools: [[Saint Rose Academy]] located in Birmingham proper [[Altamont School|The Altamont School]], also located in Birmingham proper, and [[Indian Springs School]] in north Shelby County near Pelham.

Noteworthy institutions of higher education in greater Birmingham include the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]], [[Samford University]] (includes the [[Cumberland School of Law]]), [[Birmingham School of Law]], [[Miles College]], the independent [[Miles Law School]], [[Jefferson State Community College]], [[Birmingham-Southern College]], [[University of Montevallo]] (in Shelby County), [[Lawson State Community College]], and [[Virginia College]] in Birmingham, the largest career college based in Birmingham.

==Media==
{{See also|List of television stations in Alabama|List of radio stations in Alabama}}

Birmingham is served by one major newspaper, ''[[The Birmingham News]]'' (circulation 150,346), which changed from daily to thrice-weekly publication on October 1, 2012. ''The Birmingham News''{{'}} Wednesday edition features six sub regional sections named ''East'', ''Hoover'', ''North'', ''Shelby'', ''South'', and ''West'' that cover news stories from those areas. The newspaper has been awarded two Pulitzer Prizes, in 1991 and 2007. The ''[[Birmingham Post-Herald]]'', the city's second daily, published its last issue in 2006. Other local publications include ''[[The North Jefferson News]], The Leeds News'', ''The Trussville Tribune'' (Trussville, Clay and Pinson), ''The Western Star'' (Bessemer) and ''The Western Tribune'' (Bessemer).

The ''[[Birmingham Times]]'', a historic African-American newspaper, also is published weekly. Birmingham is served by the city magazine of the Chamber of Commerce, ''[[The Birmingham News|Birmingham]]'' magazine. ''[[The Alabama Baptist]]'', published weekly in Birmingham, is an entity of the [[Alabama Baptist Convention]]. ''Black & White, Weld'', ''Birmingham Weekly'', and the ''Birmingham Free Press''<ref>{{cite web |author=Stephen Smith |url=http://www.birminghamfreepress.com/ |title=birminghamfreepress.com |publisher=birminghamfreepress.com |access-date=July 14, 2012}}</ref> are some of the free alternative publications that were published in the past (all are now defunct).

Birmingham is part of the Birmingham/Anniston/Tuscaloosa television market. The major television affiliates, most of which have their transmitters and studios located on Red Mountain in Birmingham, are [[WBRC]] 6 ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]), [[Alabama Public Television|WBIQ 10]] ([[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]), [[WVTM-TV|WVTM 13]] ([[NBC]]), [[WTTO|WTTO 21]] ([[The CW Television Network|CW]]), [[WIAT|WIAT 42]] ([[CBS]]), [[WPXH|WPXH 44]] ([[ION Television|ION]]), [[WBMA-LD|WBMA-LD 58/68.2]] ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), and [[WABM|WABM 68]] ([[MyNetworkTV]]).

Major broadcasting companies who own stations in the Birmingham market include [[IHeartMedia|Clear Channel]], [[Cox Radio]], [[Cumulus Media]], and Crawford Broadcasting. The ''[[Rick and Bubba]]'' show, which is syndicated to over 25 stations primarily in the Southeast, originates from Birmingham's [[WZZK-FM]]. The [[Paul Finebaum]] sports-talk show, also syndicated and carried nationwide on Sirius digital radio, originated from [[WJOX-FM|WJOX]].

Birmingham is home to [[EWTN]] (Eternal Word Television Network), the world's largest Catholic media outlet and religious media network of any kind, broadcasting to about 350 million television households in more than 145 countries and territories, as of 2022.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ewtn.com/media/fact-sheet.asp |title=Fact Sheet |publisher=EWTN |access-date=July 25, 2022}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==

===Urban planning in Birmingham===
[[File:Railroad Park, Birmingham.jpg|thumb|Birmingham Railroad Park]]

Before the first structure was built in Birmingham, the plan of the city was laid out over a total of {{convert|1160|acre|km2}} by the directors of the Elyton Land Co. The streets were numbered from west to east, leaving Twentieth Street to form the central spine of downtown, anchored on the north by Capital Park and stretching into the slopes of Red Mountain to the south. A "railroad reservation" was granted through the center of the city, running east to west and zoned solely for industrial uses. As the city grew, bridges and underpasses separated the streets from the railroad bed, lending this central reservation some of the impact of a river (without the pleasant associations of a waterfront). From the start, Birmingham's streets and avenues were unusually wide at 80 to 100&nbsp;feet (24 to 30&nbsp;m), purportedly to help evacuate unhealthy smoke.

In the early 20th century professional planners helped lay out many of the new industrial settlements and [[company town]]s in the Birmingham District, including Corey (now [[Fairfield, Alabama|Fairfield]]) which was developed for the [[Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company]] (subsequently purchased by [[United States Steel Corporation|U.S. Steel]]). At the same time, a movement to consolidate several neighboring cities gained momentum. Although local referendums indicated mixed feelings about annexation, the Alabama legislature enacted an expansion of Birmingham's corporate limits that became effective on January 1, 1910.

The Robert Jemison company developed many residential neighborhoods to the south and west of Birmingham which are still renowned for their aesthetic quality.

A 1924 plan for a system of parks, commissioned from the [[Olmsted Brothers]] is seeing renewed interest with several significant new parks and greenways under development. Birmingham officials have approved a City Center Master Plan developed by Urban Design Associates of Pittsburgh, which advocates strongly for more residential development in the downtown area. The plan also called for a major park over several blocks of the central railroad reservation: [[Railroad Park]], which opened in 2010. Along with Ruffner Mountain Park and [[Red Mountain Park]], Birmingham ranks first in the United States for public green space per resident.

===Utilities===
The water for Birmingham and the intermediate urbanized area is served by the Birmingham Water Works Board (BWWB). A public authority that was established in 1951, the BWWB serves all of Jefferson, northern Shelby, western St. Clair counties. The largest reservoir for BWWB is Lake Purdy, which is located on the Jefferson and Shelby County line, but has several other reservoirs including Bayview Lake in western Jefferson County. There are plans to pipeline water from Inland Lake in Blount County and Lake Logan Martin, but those plans are on hold indefinitely.

Jefferson County Environmental Services serves the Birmingham metro area with sanitary sewer service. Sewer rates have increased in recent years<ref name="BBC Scandal">{{cite web |title=The scandal of the Alabama poor cut off from water |author=Brian Wheeler |work=BBC News |date=December 14, 2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16037798 |access-date=December 15, 2011}}</ref> after citizens concerned with pollution in area waterways filed a lawsuit that resulted in a federal consent decree to repair an aging sewer system. Because the estimated cost of the consent decree was approximately three times more than the original estimate, many blame the increased rates on corruption of several Jefferson County officials.<ref name="BBC Scandal" /> The [[Jefferson County sewer controversy|sewer construction and bond-swap agreements]] continue to be a controversial topic in the area.<ref name="BBC Scandal" />

Electric power is provided primarily by [[Southern Company]]-subsidiary, Alabama Power. However, some of the surrounding area such as [[Bessemer, Alabama|Bessemer]] and [[Cullman, Alabama|Cullman]] are provided by [[Tennessee Valley Authority|TVA]]. Bessemer also operates its own water and sewer system.<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.bessemerutilities.com/history/ |publisher=Bessemer Utilities |access-date=July 26, 2022}}</ref> Natural gas is provided by [[Spire Inc|Spire]], although some metro area cities operate their own natural gas services. The local telecommunications are provided by AT&T. Cable television service is provided by [[Charter Communications]].

==Transportation==

===Highways===
[[File:I20I59Birmingham.JPG|thumb|[[Interstate 59]] (co-signed with [[Interstate 20]]) approaching [[Interstate 65]] in downtown Birmingham]]

The city is served by four Interstate Highways, [[Interstate 20 in Alabama|Interstate 20]], [[Interstate 65 in Alabama|Interstate 65]], [[Interstate 59 (Alabama)|Interstate 59]], and [[Interstate 22 (Alabama)|Interstate 22]], as well as a southern bypass expressway [[Interstate 459]], which connects with I-20/59 to the southwest, I-65 to the south, I-20 to the east, and I-59 to the northeast. Beginning in downtown Birmingham is the "[[Elton B. Stephens Expressway]]"—the ''Red Mountain Expressway'' to the southeast—which carries both [[U.S. Route 31 in Alabama|U.S. Highway 31]] and [[U.S. Highway 280 (Alabama)|U.S. Highway 280]] to, through, and over Red Mountain. [[Interstate 22]] was completed in 2012 and connects Birmingham and Memphis, Tennessee. I-22 connects with I-65 just north of the Birmingham city limits. Construction has begun on the first segment of I-422, the [[Birmingham Northern Beltline]] that will serve the suburbs on the opposite side of Birmingham from I-459.

===Public transit===
In the area of metropolitan public transportation, Birmingham is served by the [[Birmingham-Jefferson County Transit Authority]] (BJCTA) bus, [[Tourist trolley|trolley]], and [[paratransit]] system, which from 1985 until 2008 was branded the Metro Area Express (MAX). BJCTA also operates a "downtown circulator" service called "D A R T" (Downtown Area Runabout Transit), which consists of two routes in the central business district and one in the UAB area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bjcta.org |title=Birmingham-Jefferson County Transit Authority |publisher=Bjcta.org |access-date=July 14, 2012}}</ref>

A [[bus rapid transit]] line, named the Birmingham Xpress, was opened in September 2022, running from Woodlawn to Five Points West along the [[U.S. Route 11|US 11]] corridor.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bus Rapid Transit « The Official Website for the City of Birmingham, Alabama |url=https://www.birminghamal.gov/brt |access-date=October 8, 2022 |language=en}}</ref> Bus service to other cites is provided by [[Greyhound Lines]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://locations.greyhound.com/bus-stations/us/alabama/birmingham/bus-station-420156 |title=Birmingham Alabama Bus Station |work=greyhound.com |access-date=July 21, 2015}}</ref> [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]] also offers bus service to Atlanta and Memphis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://us.megabus.com/routemap.aspx |title=Megabus &#124; Low cost bus tickets from $1 |access-date=April 24, 2015 |archive-date=April 23, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423071232/http://us.megabus.com/routemap.aspx |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Air===
Birmingham is served by the [[Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport]]. This airport serves more than 3&nbsp;million passengers every year. With more than 160 flights daily, the airport offers flights to 37 cities across the United States. Commercial passenger service through Birmingham is provided by [[United Express]], [[Delta Air Lines]]/Delta Connection, [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]], and [[Southwest Airlines]].

===Rail===
====Passenger====
Birmingham was a railroad hub from its founding, and its [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] [[Birmingham Terminal Station|Terminal Station]] was a major passenger stop for many trains crossing the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] until the creation of [[Amtrak]] on May 1, 1971, when all but one of Birmingham's passenger trains were eliminated. The only remaining passenger service is the Amtrak ''[[Crescent (train)|Crescent]]'', with one train eastbound and one train westbound daily from the [[Birmingham, Alabama (Amtrak station)|Birmingham Amtrak station]]. The ''Crescent'' route connects Birmingham with [[Washington D.C.|Washington, D.C.]], and points northeast and northwest of there; [[Greensboro, NC]]; [[Charlotte, NC]]; [[Greenville, SC]]; [[Atlanta, GA]]; [[Anniston, AL]]; [[Tuscaloosa, AL]]; [[Meridian, MS]]; [[Hattiesburg, MS]]; and [[New Orleans, LA]].

Another Amtrak train, the ''[[Floridian (train, 1971–1979)|Floridian]]'', served Birmingham en route from Chicago to Florida points from November 1971 to October 1979, when it was cancelled for low ridership. From May 1974 to September 1977, the [[Auto-Train Corporation]] operated its eponymous train via Birmingham on its [[Louisville, Kentucky]] to [[Sanford, Florida]] route. However, Birmingham was not a passenger stop for the ''Auto-Train'', merely a crew-change point.<ref>{{cite web |title=Timeline for the 1971-1981 Auto-Train |url=https://www.themetrains.com/auto-train-timeline.htm |website=The Story of the 1971-1981 Auto-Train |publisher=Accuen Media, LLC |access-date=April 30, 2023}}</ref> The Auto-Train Corporation went out of business in 1981, but since 1983, Amtrak has operated another ''[[Auto Train]]'' (no hyphen) between [[Lorton, Virginia]], and Sanford; it does not enter Alabama.

Beginning in October 1989, Amtrak's ''[[Gulf Breeze (train)|Gulf Breeze]]'' was a section of the ''[[Crescent]]'' that split from the ''Crescent'' at Birmingham and ran to [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], stopping at several intermediate points. The state of Alabama shared the operating costs with Amtrak; however, due to dismally low ridership, the ''Gulf Breeze'' was discontinued in April 1995.

====Freight====
Birmingham is served by three major [[freight railroad]] companies, the [[Norfolk Southern]] Company, [[CSX Transportation]], and [[BNSF Railway]], all of which have major [[railroad yard]]s in the metro area. Smaller regional railroads such as the [[Alabama Warrior Railway]] and the [[Birmingham Southern Railroad]] also serve customers in Birmingham.
