'''Dazhou''' ({{zh|s= 达州 |t= 達州 |p=Dázhōu |w=Ta-chou}}) is a [[prefecture-level city]] in the northeast corner of [[Sichuan]] province, China, bordering [[Shaanxi]] to the north and [[Chongqing]] to the east and south.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=POP&f=tableCode%3A240|title = UNdata &#124; record view &#124; Series not found!}}</ref> As of 2020 census, Dazhou was home to 5,385,422 inhabitants whom 1,850,869 lived in the built-up (''or metro'') area made of 2 urban districts.

==History==
[[File:Segalen-21-Shen-Que-Taotie.jpg|thumb|left|A [[taotie]] on the [[Han dynasty]] Shen family mausoleum (Mausoleum of the Prefect of Shen, {{lang|zh-hans|沈府君阙}})]]
Dazhou's history goes back to the [[Eastern Han]] dynasty when in 90 AD it was made a county by the name of Liweizhou {{lang|zh-hans|(历为州}}). Then until the Liao dynasty its name was Zaidi ({{lang|zh|在地}}). During the Liao and Tang dynasties its name was again changed, this time to Tongzhou ({{lang|zh-hans|通州}}). Finally in the [[Song dynasty]] it was given its present name of Dazhou.

Notable people from Dazhou include the [[Three Kingdoms]] writer [[Chen Shou]], Song dynasty astronomer [[Zhang Sixun]], and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty]] philosopher and educator [[Tang Zhen]]. Dazhou also made notable contributions to the Communist Revolution. Red Army heroes such as [[Xu Xiangqian]], [[Li Xiannian]], [[Xu Shiyou]], [[Wang Weizhou]] ({{lang|zh-hans|王维舟}}), and [[Zhang Aiping]] were all from or lived in Dazhou.

The partially preserved mausoleum complex of the Shen ({{lang|zh-hans|沈}}) family in [[Qu County]] (particularly its gate towers known as ''[[que (tower)|que]])''
built in the [[Han dynasty]], is a well-known architectural monument.<ref>[[Victor Segalen]],   [http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/segalen_victor/C18_chine_grande_statuaire/grande_statuaire.html "Chine. La grande statuaire", and "Les origines de la statuaire en Chine"], p. 46 sq</ref>

==Geography and climate==
Dazhou is the easternmost [[prefecture-level division]] of the province, bordering [[Ankang]] and [[Hanzhong]] (both in [[Shaanxi]]) to the north, [[Chengkou County]], [[Kai County]], and [[Wanzhou District]] of [[Chongqing]] to the east, the Chongqing counties of [[Liangping]] and [[Dianjiang]] to the south, [[Guang'an]] to the southwest, [[Nanchong]] to the west, and [[Bazhong]] to the northwest. It is centrally located between Chongqing and [[Xi'an]]. The area is {{convert|16,600|km²}}.<ref>{{Cite web |title=达州市人民政府_达州概况_达州概况 |trans-title=Dazhou Municipal People's Government_Dazhou Overview_Dazhou Overview |url=https://www.dazhou.gov.cn/news-show-199910.html |access-date=2024-06-21 |website=www.dazhou.gov.cn}}</ref>

The terrain is largely mountainous ([[Daba Mountains]] and adjacent ranges).

Typical of the [[Sichuan Basin]], Dazhou has a [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwa'') and is largely mild and humid, with four distinct seasons. Winter is short, mild, and foggy, though actual precipitation is low. January averages {{convert|6.1|°C|1}} and, while frost may occur, snow is rare. Summers are long, hot and humid, with highs often exceeding {{convert|33|°C}}. The monthly daily average in July, the warmest month, is {{convert|27.4|°C}}. Rainfall is light in winter and can be heavy in summer, and over 70% of the annual total occurs from May to September. The annual frost-free period lasts around 300 days.<ref>{{Cite web |title=达州市地情 |url=https://www.scsqw.cn/scdqs/sxdq/dzs/content_19583 |archive-url= |website=四川省情网}}</ref>
