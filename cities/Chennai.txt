It is the state's [[primate city]] and is located on the [[Coromandel Coast]] of the [[Bay of Bengal]]. According to the [[2011 Census of India|2011 Indian census]], Chennai is the [[List of most populous cities in India|sixth-most populous city]] in India and forms the [[List of million-plus urban agglomerations in India|fourth-most populous urban agglomeration]]. Incorporated in 1688, the [[Greater Chennai Corporation]] is the oldest [[municipal corporation]] in India and the second oldest in the world after [[London]].

Historically, the region was part of the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]], [[Pandya dynasty|Pandya]], [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]] and [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]] kingdoms during various eras. The coastal land which then contained the fishing village Madrasapattinam, was purchased by the [[British East India Company]] from the [[Nayak (title)|Nayak]] ruler [[Damarla Chennapa Nayaka|Chennapa Nayaka]] in the 17th century. The British garrison established the Madras city and [[Chennai port|port]] and built [[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]], the first British fortress in India. The city was made the winter capital of the [[Madras Presidency]], a [[Colonialism|colonial]] province of the [[British Raj]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. After [[Indian independence movement|India gained independence]] in 1947, Madras continued as the capital city of the [[Madras State]] and present-day Tamil Nadu. The city was officially [[List of renamed Indian cities and states#Tamil Nadu|renamed]] as Chennai in 1996.

The city is coterminous with [[Chennai district]], which together with the adjoining suburbs constitutes the [[Chennai Metropolitan Area]],{{efn|The term Chennai is often used to denote the Chennai Metropolitan Area, colloquially applied for the wider area than just the city. This area includes the city/district of Chennai, and adjacent parts from its three neighbouring districts. This wider usage of the term has been documented as far back as 1639, when the Madras Municipal Corporation was created}} the [[List of urban areas by population|35th-largest urban area in the world by population]] and one of the largest metropolitan economies of India. Chennai has the [[List of cities by GDP|fifth-largest urban economy]] and the third-largest [[expatriate]] population in India. As a gateway to South India, Chennai is among the most-visited Indian cities ranking 36th among the most-visited cities in the world in 2019. Ranked as a beta-level city in the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network|Global Cities Index]], Chennai regularly features among the best cities to live in India and is amongst the safest cities in India.

Chennai is a major centre for [[medical tourism]] and is termed "India's health capital". Chennai houses a major portion of India's automobile industry, hence the name "[[Detroit]] of India". It was the only South Asian city to be ranked among [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'s "Top 10 food cities" in 2015 and ranked ninth on [[Lonely Planet]]'s best cosmopolitan cities in the world. In October 2017, Chennai was added to the [[UNESCO]] Creative Cities Network (UCCN) list. It is a major [[film production]] centre and home to the [[Tamil cinema|Tamil-language film industry]].
