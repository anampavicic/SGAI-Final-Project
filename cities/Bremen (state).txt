'''Bremen''' ({{IPA|de|ˈbʁeːmən|lang|de-Bremen.ogg}}), officially the '''Free [[Hanseatic League#Lists of former Hansa cities|Hanseatic]] City of Bremen''' ({{langx|de|Freie Hansestadt Bremen}}; {{langx|nds|Free Hansestadt Bremen}}), is the smallest and least populous of [[States of Germany|Germany's 16 states]]. It is informally called {{lang|de|Land Bremen}} ('State of Bremen'), although the term is sometimes used in official contexts. The state consists of the city of [[Bremen]] and its seaport [[exclave]], [[Bremerhaven]], surrounded by the larger state of [[Lower Saxony]] in northern Germany.

==Geography==
The state of Bremen consists of two non-contiguous territories. These enclaves contain [[Bremen]], officially the 'City' (''Stadtgemeinde Bremen'') which is the state capital, and the city of [[Bremerhaven]] (''Stadt Bremerhaven''). Both are located on the River [[Weser]]; Bremerhaven ("Bremen's harbour") is further downstream on the mouth of the Weser with open access to the [[North Sea]]. Both enclaves are completely surrounded by the neighbouring State of [[Lower Saxony]] (''Niedersachsen''). The highest point in the state is in [[Friedehorst Park]] (32.5 metres; 107').

==History==
{{Main article|History of Bremen (city)|Timeline of Bremen}}

When the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was dissolved in 1806, what had been since 1646 (after earlier privileges of autonomy of 1186) the [[Free Imperial City]] of Bremen was not [[German mediatisation|mediatised]]. Rather than being incorporated into the enlarged territory of one of the surrounding monarchies, it was recognised (along with [[Hamburg]]) as a sovereign ''[[Hanseatic League|Free Hanseatic City]]''. Its currency until 1873 was the [[Bremen thaler]].  

In 1811, in an effort to enforce [[Napoleon]]'s [[Berlin Decree]] embargoing Britain, the [[First French Empire]] had annexed the [[city-state]]. But at the [[Congress of Vienna|Congress of Vienna of 1815]], Bremen's emissary, and later [[burgomaster]], [[Johann Smidt]], lobbied successfully to have the city's independence restored as one of the 39 sovereign states within the new [[German Confederation]].

In 1827, Bremen bought land at the mouth of the Weser from the [[Kingdom of Hanover]], in order to build a new seaport, [[Bremerhaven]]. This ensured that Bremen remained Germany's main port of embarkation for emigrants to the Americas, and that it developed as an entrepôt for Germany's late developing colonial trade.

In 1867, the year following [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]'s defeat of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and its annexation of Hanover, Bremen joined the [[North German Confederation]]. In 1871, following [[Franco-Prussian War|victory over the French]], this became the [[German Empire]] with Bremen as one of the [[Reich]]'s 26 constituent states.

As an international port and industrial centre, Bremen had a strong left and liberal tradition. In January 1913, at the last elections to the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Imperial Reichstag]] in Berlin, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats (SPD)]] secured over half the vote, or 53.4%. Left Liberals (Linksliberale) took another 41.4%. Only 5.1% went to the Conservatives.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Reichstag 1867-1918 – Bremen|url=https://www.wahlen-in-deutschland.de/kuStBremen.htm|access-date=2021-05-17|website=wahlen-in-deutschland.de}}</ref> During the [[Weimar Republic]], there were seven [[Bremen state elections in the Weimar Republic|elections to the ''Burgerschaft'']], the Bremen parliament. At the [[November 1932 German federal election]], the last broadly free election during this time, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] won 31.2% of the vote, and the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists (KPD)]] 16.8%, compared to 20.8% for the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Reichstagswahlen 1919-1933 – Bremen|url=https://wahlen-in-deutschland.de/wubremen.htm|access-date=2021-05-17|website=wahlen-in-deutschland.de}}</ref><ref>Herbert Schwarzwälder (1983) ''Bremen in der Weimarer Republik (1918–1933)'' (Geschichte der Freien Hansestadt Bremen, Vol. 3), Christians, 1983, p. 609.</ref>

Following the heavily compromised national elections of March 1933, the Nazis still achieved only a third of the popular vote in Bremen (32.7%).<ref name=":0" /> Bremen, like all the German states, then underwent the process of ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' (coordination) whereby the Nazi regime, through a campaign of violent demonstrations and intimidation, first forced the resignation of the executive Senate and later dissolved the ''Bürgerschaft''. Bremen remained for the next twelve years under the direct authority of a ''[[Reichsstatthalter]]'' (Reich Governor) who simultaneously held the post of Nazi Party ''[[Gauleiter]]'' of [[Gau Weser-Ems]]. During these years, Bremen's small Jewish community (1,438 people registered at the beginning of 1933)<ref>[[Herbert Schwarzwälder]] (2003), ''Das Große Bremen-Lexikon''. Edition Temmen, {{ISBN|3-86108-693-X}}, p. 442.</ref> was destroyed through coerced emigration and [[The Holocaust|deportation to death camps in the occupied east]].

[[Bombing of Bremen in World War II|Allied bombing]] during World War II destroyed or severely damaged 60% of the city's built fabric, including much of its historic centre. Following a further bombardment, British troops entered Bremen in late April 1945. Transferred to the Americans, Bremen became the supply port for the US [[Allied-occupied Germany|zones of occupation]] in [[west Berlin]] and southern Germany.

The city was reestablished as a state in 1947 and, from 1949, was again known as the ''Free Hanseatic City of Bremen'', becoming a Land or state of the new [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], informally referred to as "[[West Germany]]" until 1990.

==Politics==
{{See also|State Office for the Protection of the Constitution of Bremen}}

===Political system===
{{Expand section|date=November 2009}}
The legislature of the state of Bremen is the 87-member [[Bürgerschaft of Bremen|Bürgerschaft]] (citizens' assembly), elected by the citizens in the two cities of [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] and [[Bremerhaven]].

The executive is constituted by the [[Senate of Bremen]], elected by the Bürgerschaft. The Senate is chaired by the President of the senate (''Senatspräsident''), who is also one of the [[Mayor of Bremen|mayors of the city of Bremen]] (''Bürgermeister'') and is elected directly by the Bürgerschaft. The Senate selects of its members as a second mayor who serves as deputy of the president. In contrast to the Federal Chancellor of Germany or other German states, the President of the Senate has no authority to override senators on policy, which is decided upon by the senate collectively. Since 1945, the Senate has continuously been dominated by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]].

On a municipal level, the two cities in the state are administered separately:
* The administration of the [[Bremen (city)|city of Bremen]] is headed by the two mayors and controlled by the portion of the [[Bürgerschaft of Bremen|Bürgerschaft]] elected in the city of Bremen (72 members).
* [[Bremerhaven]], on the other hand, has a municipal assembly distinct from the state legislature and an administration under a distinct head mayor (''Oberbürgermeister'') and a distinct second mayor.

===Political majorities===
In post-war Bremen, the port, shipyards and related industries sustained a large and unionised working class. As before 1933, this translated into support for the Social Democrats, considered Bremen's natural governing party. However, in the 1980s mechanisation of the port and closure of the city's leading shipbuilder induced an employment crisis and shook the confidence of the party's traditional voter base. The SPD, which had still polled 51% in 1987, lost its effective majority.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bürgerschaftswahlen Bremen seit 1945 – Ergebnisse in der Stadt Bremen|url=https://www.wahlen-in-deutschland.de/bluBremen.htm|access-date=2021-05-19|website=wahlen-in-deutschland.de}}</ref> The once dominant left-liberal vote split, and coalition government became the norm.

The [[2019 Bremen state election]] was held on 26 May 2019 to elect the members of the [[Bürgerschaft of Bremen]], as well as the city councils of [[Bremen]] and [[Bremerhaven]]. The election took place on the same day as the [[2019 European Parliament election]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merkur.de/politik/buergerschaftswahl-2019-in-bremen-wichtigsten-fakten-im-ueberblick-zr-12126649.html|title=Bürgerschaftswahl 2019 in Bremen: Die wichtigsten Fakten im Überblick|date=2019-04-05|website=merkur.de|language=de|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/buergerschaftswahl-2019-in-bremen-fragen-und-antworten-zur-wahl-in-bremen/24279468.html|title=Bürgerschaftswahl 2019 in Bremen: Fragen und Antworten zur Wahl in Bremen|website=handelsblatt.com|language=de|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://landesportal.bremen.de/buergerschaft/buergerschaftswahl|title=Bürgerschaftswahl 2019 – Wahlen zur Bremischen Bürgerschaft|website=landesportal.bremen.de|language=de|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref> The [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU), for the first time, became the largest party in the Bürgerschaft, while the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) fell to second place. [[Alliance 90/The Greens|The Greens]] and [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] made small gains. After the election, the SPD, Greens, and Left agreed to form a coalition government. [[Carsten Sieling]] resigned as mayor and was replaced by fellow SPD member [[Andreas Bovenschulte]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article196484023/Bremen-So-tickt-Andreas-Bovenschulte-SPD.html|title=Bremen: So tickt Andreas Bovenschulte (SPD)|newspaper=Die Welt |date=8 July 2019|via=welt.de}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.butenunbinnen.de/nachrichten/politik/spd-grosse-koalition-absage-100.html|title=Bremer SPD schließt Koalition mit CDU aus – buten un binnen|website=butenunbinnen.de|access-date=25 July 2020|archive-date=26 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190526165401/https://www.butenunbinnen.de/nachrichten/politik/spd-grosse-koalition-absage-100.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Economy==
Bremen's post-[[World War II]] economy boomed in line with the West German ''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'' of the 1950s and 60s. This saw the growth, and permanent settlement, in Bremen of a large migrant worker population, drawn largely from [[Turkey]] and southern Europe.

Some of the city's heavier industries failed to recover from the [[1973 oil crisis|oil-price-shock]] recession of the early 1970s. Specialist construction yards, ship outfitters and parts suppliers remain, but [[AG Weser]] (which employed 16,000 workers at its peak) and [[Bremer Vulkan|Bremer Vulcan]], Bremen's major shipbuilders, closed in 1983 and 1997 respectively. Further job losses were caused by the restructuring and increasing mechanisation of harbour-related activities and other industrial sectors. Semi and unskilled harbour workers found it very difficult to re-enter the labour market, and unemployment—for a period in the 1980s almost double the West German average—remained comparatively high.

At a time when structural change in the economy has forced Bremen to spend more on social services, [[Suburbanization|suburbanisation]] has reduced population and tax revenue, namely due to 1969 federal tax reform - before that, income taxes would be collected by the municipality of the workplace, but after that, by the municipality of the residency. Incorporating surrounding suburban municipalities, is not an option for Bremen as these belong to the state of Lower Saxony.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Plöger|first=Jörg|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/3623/1/Bremen_city_report_(final).pdf|title=Bremen: City Report|publisher=Centre for the Analysis of Social Exclusion, LSE|year=2007|location=London}}</ref>

With financial assistance from the [[European Union]], and from the Federal Government, economic policy has focused on supporting those established economic sectors that are based on advanced technology, such as aerospace and aircraft production, automobile production, maritime and logistics services, and on developing the education and business-park infrastructure for new science-based and digital enterprises. In this an important role is accorded to the growing university sector. Further investment went into the revitalisation of the city centre but a culture-driven regeneration around entertainment and tourism was not very successful. Several experts described Bremen's service sector as underdeveloped, due to a lack of major company headquarters.<ref name=":1" />

=== Unemployment ===
At the turn of the new century, unemployment in Bremen stood at 13%, a rate matched in the Federal Republic only by the "new states" in former East Germany. By 2022, while reduced to 10.2% it was the highest among all 16 German states.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Arbeitslosenquote nach Bundesländern 2022 |url=https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/36651/umfrage/arbeitslosenquote-in-deutschland-nach-bundeslaendern/ |access-date=2022-12-04 |website=Statista |language=de}}</ref>
