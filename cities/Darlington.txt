In the 19th century, establishment of the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] (the world's first permanent [[steam locomotive]]-powered passenger railway) led to the town having an [[industrialisation|industrial]] and manufacturing economy.

==History==
===Darnton===
[[File:St Cuthbert's Church, Darlington (geograph 6355021).jpg|thumb|right|St Cuthbert's Church]]
Darlington started as an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] settlement. The name derives from the Anglo-Saxon ''Dearthington'', which seemingly meant 'the settlement of Deornoth's people' but, by Norman times, the name had changed to Derlinton. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the town was usually known by the name of ''Darnton''.<ref name="englandsnortheast">{{Cite web |title=Darlington |url=http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/DarlingtonTees.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201027151735/http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/DarlingtonTees.html |archive-date=27 October 2020 |access-date=4 May 2011 |website=englandsnortheast.co.uk}}</ref>

Darlington has a historic market area in the town centre. [[St Cuthbert's Church, Darlington|St Cuthbert's Church]], built in 1183, is one of the most important early English churches in the north of England and is [[Grade I]] listed.<ref name=visitdarlington>{{Cite web |title=visitdarlington.com: The Leading Visited Darlington Site on the Net<!-- Bot generated title --> |url=http://www.visitdarlington.com/images/icons_large/icon_pdf.gif |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203041339/http://www.visitdarlington.com/images/icons_large/icon_pdf.gif |archive-date=3 February 2011 |website=visitdarlington.com}}</ref> The oldest church in Darlington is [[St Andrew's Church, Haughton-le-Skerne|St Andrew's Church]], built around 1100 in [[Haughton-le-Skerne]].

When the author [[Daniel Defoe]] visited the town during the 18th century, he noted that it was eminent for "good bleaching of linen, so that I have known cloth brought from Scotland to be bleached here". However, he also disparaged the town, writing that it had "nothing remarkable but dirt"; roads would have typically been unpaved in the 18th century. <ref>{{Cite book |last=Defoe |first=Daniel |title=A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain, divided into circuits or journies |publisher=J.

The so-called ''[[Durham Ox]]'' came from Darlington; born in the early 19th century, this steer became renowned for its excellent proportions which came to inform the standard for Shorthorn cattle.<ref name="englandsnortheast" />

====Stivvies====

During the early 19th century, Darlington remained a small market town.<ref>{{Cite web |title=A History of Darlington |url=http://www.localhistories.org/darlington.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191203005824/http://www.localhistories.org/darlington.html |archive-date=3 December 2019 |access-date=4 May 2011 |website=localhistories.org}}</ref>

The [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] ran steam locomotives designed for passengers and goods, built to a standard gauge, on a permanent main line with branches. On 27 September 1825, [[George Stephenson]]'s engine, ''[[Locomotion No. 1]]'', travelled between [[Shildon]] and [[Stockton-on-Tees]] via Darlington, an event that was seen as ushering in the modern railway age.

Later in the 19th century, the town became an important centre for railway manufacturing. An early railway works was the [[Hopetown Carriage Works]] (est. 1853), which supplied carriages and locomotives to the Stockton and Darlington Railway. The engineering firm of [[William and Alfred Kitching]] also manufactured locomotives there around this time. The town eventually developed three significant railway works:
* The largest of these was the main line [[Darlington Works]]; its main factory, the North Road Shops, opened in 1863 and remained in operation until 1966. 
* [[Robert Stephenson and Company|Robert Stephenson & Co.]] (colloquially: "Stivvies"), moved to Darlington from [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] in 1902. It was renamed ''Robert Stephensons & Hawthorns'' in 1937, was absorbed by [[English Electric]] around 1960 and had closed by 1964. 
* [[Faverdale Wagon Works]] was established in 1923 and closed in 1962; in the 1950s, it was a UK pioneer in applying mass-production techniques to the manufacture of railway goods wagons.

====Quakers and the Echo====
During the 19th century, Darlington [[Quaker]] families such as those of [[Pease family (Darlington)|Pease]] and [[Backhouse's Bank|Backhouse]] emerged as major employers and philanthropists. Industrialist [[Joseph Pease (railway pioneer)|Joseph Pease]] gave Darlington its landmark [[clock tower]] in 1864.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Roberts |first=David |date=7 April 2011 |title=Town clock keeps up with the chimes |work=[[The Northern Echo]] |url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/8958754.Town_clock_keeps_up_with_the_chimes/ |url-status=live |access-date=4 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905022952/http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/8958754.Town_clock_keeps_up_with_the_chimes/ |archive-date=5 September 2018}}</ref> The clock face was crafted by [[T.

[[Architect]] [[Alfred Waterhouse]], famous for work including London's [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] and [[Manchester Town Hall]], designed  Darlington's [[Grade II listed]] [[Old Town Hall and Market Hall, Darlington]] in 1860. Four years later he contributed Backhouse's Bank building that is, {{as of|2022|lc=yes}}, a branch of [[Barclays]] bank.<ref name=visitdarlington />

During the period, [[George Gordon Hoskins]] was responsible for much of the town's architecture, designing buildings such as The King's Head Hotel.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

Darlington Free Library, a [[Grade II listed]] building in Crown Street, was built for £10,000 by [[Edward Pease (railway pioneer)|Edward Pease]]. His daughter, Lady Lymington, opened the building on 23 October 1885 and presented it to the town council who agreed to operate it in perpetuity. {{As of|2022}}, it contains a library and "centre for local studies".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Darlington Town Centre Heritage Trail |url=http://www.visitdarlington.com/downloads/Heritage%20Trail%20Guide.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717221910/http://www.visitdarlington.com/downloads/Heritage%20Trail%20Guide.pdf |archive-date=17 July 2011 |website=visitdarlington.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Crown Street – Darlington Libraries – celebrating 130 years 1885–2015 |url=http://www2.darlington.gov.uk/web/arena/crown-street-library |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003132457/https://www2.darlington.gov.uk/web/arena/crown-street-library |archive-date=3 October 2017 |access-date=29 January 2019 |website=darlington.gov.uk}}</ref>

It was intended to be the 50th member of the long withdrawn [[LNER Peppercorn Class A1]] engine, called [[LNER Peppercorn Class A1 60163 Tornado|''Tornado'']] and numbered 60163, from scratch in the 1853 former [[Stockton and Darlington Railway Carriage Works]] at Hopetown. Many of the original fleet had been built at [[Darlington Works|Darlington locomotive works]] in the late 1940s. ''Tornado'' was completed in January 2008.

To commemorate the town's contribution to the railways, [[David Mach]]'s 1997 work [[Train by David Mach|''Train'']] is located alongside the A66, close to the original Stockton–Darlington railway.

Darlington was an [[ancient parish]]. It was historically divided into four [[Township (England)|townships]]: [[Archdeacon Newton]], [[Blackwell, County Durham|Blackwell]], [[Cockerton]], and a Darlington township covering the town itself and adjoining areas. Such townships also became [[civil parish]]es in 1866.<ref>{{cite web |title=Darlington Ancient Parish / Civil Parish |url=https://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10022976 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=3 March 2024 |archive-date=31 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240331093627/https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10022976 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The History of the Antiquities of the County Palatine of Durham: Volume 3 |date=1823 |publisher=Nichols and Son |location=London |pages=350–377 |url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/antiquities-durham/vol3/pp350-377 |access-date=3 March 2024 |archive-date=3 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240303080144/https://www.british-history.ac.uk/antiquities-durham/vol3/pp350-377 |url-status=live }}</ref> A body of [[improvement commissioners]] was established in 1823 to provide infrastructure to the more built-up parts of the Darlington township.<ref>{{cite web |title=Darlington Improvement Act 1823 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Geo4/4/3/contents/enacted |website=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives |access-date=3 March 2024 |archive-date=16 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240116001230/https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Geo4/4/3/contents/enacted |url-status=live }}</ref> The commissioners were superseded in 1850 when the whole Darlington township was made a [[Local board of health|local board district]], governed by an elected local board.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lawes |first1=Edward |title=The Act for Promoting the Public Health, with notes and an appendix |date=1851 |publisher=Shaw and Sons |location=London |pages=262–263 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MRJXAAAAcAAJ&pg=262 |access-date=3 March 2024}}</ref>

The local board was in turn replaced when Darlington was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]] in 1867. The borough boundaries were enlarged on several occasions, notably absorbing the [[Harrowgate, County Durham|Harrowgate Hill]] area from the parish of [[Haughton-le-Skerne]] in 1872, Cockerton in 1915, Haughton-le-Skerne in 1930 and Blackwell in 1967. In 1915 the borough was elevated to become a [[county borough]], taking over county-level functions from [[Durham County Council]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Darlington Municipal Borough / County Borough |url=https://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10136829&c_id=# |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=3 March 2024}}</ref>

The borough was substantially enlarged in 1974 to take in most of the surrounding Darlington Rural District, such that the modern borough of Darlington covers both the town and a surrounding rural hinterland. The enlarged borough was also reconstituted as a [[non-metropolitan district]] as part of the 1974 reforms, with Durham County Council once more providing county-level services to the town.<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=si|si=The English Non-metropolitan Districts (Definition) Order 1972|year=1972|number=2039|access-date=3 March 2024}}</ref> The borough was made a [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]] on 1 April 1997, regaining its independence from the county council.

Since 2016, the council has been a member of the Tees Valley Combined Authority along with [[Borough of Hartlepool|Hartlepool]], [[Middlesbrough Council|Middlesbrough]], [[Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council|Redcar and Cleveland]] and [[Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council|Stockton-on-Tees]].

==Geography==
[[File:River Skerne, Darlington (geograph 5228944).jpg|thumb|The River Skerne just east of the town centre and the spire of St Cuthbert's Church]]
Darlington is located in the south of [[County Durham]] close to the River Tees, which acts as the border between Durham and Yorkshire. Both the [[River Tees]] and [[River Skerne]] pass through the borough, the Skerne later joining the Tees which then flows east and into the [[North Sea]]. Due to [[river bifurcation]] at the Baydale Beck and Cocker Beck, which later flow into the Tees and Skerne respectively, much of the western side of Darlington forms a [[river island]].

===Areas within the borough===
In the north are [[Harrowgate, County Durham|Harrowgate]], [[Coatham Mundeville]] and [[Beaumont Hill]] and to the north-east are [[Whinfield]] and Haughton Le Skerne. To the east is the suburb of Eastbourne and Red Hall with [[Firthmoor]] and [[Skerne Park]] to the south. Situated in the west end are [[Hummersknott]], [[Mowden, County Durham|Mowden]] and [[Blackwell, County Durham|Blackwell]]. Finally, to the north-west are [[Branksome, County Durham|Branksome]], [[Cockerton]], [[Faverdale]], [[The Denes]], [[West Park, Darlington|West Park]], High Grange and Pierremont which is associated with the notable [[Henry Pease (MP)]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=29 July 2009 |title=An ice house was the perfect way for a mansion-owner to keep his cool |work=The Northern Echo |url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/columnists/memories/darlington/4518765.An_ice_house_was_the_perfect_way_for_a_mansion_owner_to_keep_his_cool/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117155719/http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/columnists/memories/darlington/4518765.An_ice_house_was_the_perfect_way_for_a_mansion_owner_to_keep_his_cool/ |archive-date=17 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Lloyd |first=Chris |date=3 February 2011 |title=Home, sweet home |work=The Northern Echo |url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/8831918.Home__sweet_home |url-status=live |access-date=24 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007070202/http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/8831918.Home__sweet_home/ |archive-date=7 October 2017}}</ref>

===Roads===
Darlington is well connected to the North East's major trunk route, the [[A1(M) motorway|A1(M)]], which bypasses the town to the west. It was completed in 1965, replacing the Great North Road route which is now known as the A167. The town is served by three closely-spaced junctions of the A1(M): junctions 57 ([[A66(M)]]), 58 (A68) and 59 (A167), which is also the access exit for Darlington motorway services (Newton Park), with an on-site filling station, hotel and restaurant. 

The town is also close to other major trunk routes, including the A66 trans-Pennine route connecting Darlington to Stockton-on-Tees and the [[A19 road|A19]].

The £5.9&nbsp;million {{convert|5|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} A66 Darlington eastern bypass opened on 25 November 1985. The Darlington Eastern Transport Corridor, linking the Central Park regeneration zone (Haughton Road) and Darlington town centre to a new roundabout on the A66, was opened in the summer of 2008.

===Buses===
[[File:Arriva Optare Solo buses in Darlington 5 May 2009 pic 1.JPG|thumb|right|Arriva buses in Darlington]]
Bus routes in the town are provided mostly by [[Arriva North East]]; its services connect Darlington to neighbouring towns and cities such as Durham, Bishop Auckland, Richmond, Stockton and Middlesbrough. There are also two smaller independent operators running services: [[Dales & District]] and Hodgsons Buses.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bustimes.org/localities/darlington |website=Bustimes.org |title=Darlington bus services |access-date=3 November 2024}}</ref>

[[Stagecoach North East]] operated originally in the town until 2007, when it sold its operations to Arriva.  Stagecoach returned to Darlington in 2023, following the decision by Arriva to end its service 12 from Hurworth to Middleton St. George and Teesside Airport; it took over this service on 23 September 2023, renumbering it as route 6 (6A on Sundays) and extending it to Stockton, via Eaglescliffe, Yarm and Ingleby Barwick.

===Cycling===
Darlington was chosen by the Department for Transport as one of three national ''Sustainable Travel Demonstration Towns'' (together with Peterborough and Worcester) in 2004 and delivering a three-year research and marketing programme to promote sustainable travel choices under the brand name ''Local Motion''. It was also chosen as one of six cycling demonstration towns in October 2005, receiving £3&nbsp;million worth of funding from the government and local council money.<ref>{{Cite news |date=21 October 2005 |title=£3m to make town a more friendly place for cyclists |work=The Northern Echo |url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/7148005.__3m_to_make_town_a_more_friendly_place_for_cyclists/ |url-status=live |access-date=11 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225130545/http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/7148005.__3m_to_make_town_a_more_friendly_place_for_cyclists/ |archive-date=25 February 2017}}</ref>

The 2007 ''Town Centre Pedestrian Heart Project'', an investment of £10 million, saw some of Darlington's town centre modernised; there was an emphasis on vehicles becoming less common in the centre and some roads pedestrianised completely. Other improvements were to cycling facilities and routes, linking the town to the national cycle route network. Darlington is the only place to win both sustainable travel and cycling demonstration town status.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2 February 2006 |title=Cycling comments needed |work=The Northern Echo |url=http://archive.thenorthernecho.co.uk/2006/2/2/217551.html |access-date=11 February 2008}}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

[[File:Athletics Track, Eastbourne Leisure Centre (geograph 4429468).jpg|thumb|Eastbourne Leisure Centre's athletics track]]
Darlington's leading athletics club, Darlington Harriers AC, was formed in 1891 and has had a number of successful athletes wearing the club colours as well as competing internationally at Commonwealth, European and Olympic Games (London 1908, London 1948 and Tokyo 1964). The club stemmed from the Darlington Foot Harriers who travelled in packs hunting hares. Some of the key members, including Thomas and Charles Mountford, founded the club which went on to become one of the most notable clubs in the country.    

The club celebrated its 125th year in 2016, with anniversary games held at Eastbourne Sports Complex and was also the first club in the UK to be granted a licence via England Athletics new systems whilst the country was coming out of the COVID19 pandemic.  
  
In 2019, the club was awarded the Queen's Award for Voluntary Services (QAVS), which was created in 2002 to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee. This was previously known as the ''Queen's Award for Voluntary Service (QAVS)''. Equivalent to an MBE, this award (changed to KAVS since [[King Charles III]] came to the throne) is the highest award given to local voluntary groups in the UK. The club was also winner of the 2021 and 2022 Regional England Athletics North East Volunteering ''Club of the Year'' awards. 

In 2015, the club also moved away from the 'D' vest which had been introduced in the late 1970s, moving initially to ''Darlington Harriers'' before a new club logo was introduced in 2018. The new logo shape is the [[DL postcode area]], includes the towns landmarks in Joseph Pease's statue, the town clock and the brick train which represents the town's history in the railway industry.  
The club has also introduced further events to its athletics calendar in recent years, adding to the existing 'Pitstop' 10km race which has been running since 2001. Multi-lap events held at South Park include South Park 10 (mile), South Park 20 were introduced in 2016 and The Marathon Paarlauf in 2022. The athletics track where the club are based at Eastbourne Complex received a make over in 2023 as part of a £1.6&nbsp;million re-design of the complex with a new Blue 8 lane track to match the club colours.  

The other athletics-based event is the Darlington 10km and 3km road run, which is held every August; it attracts around 2,000 competitors and is managed by the local council.

The Dolphin Centre, which provides a wide range of sporting facilities, was opened by [[Roger Bannister]] in 1982. It received a £5&nbsp;million refurbishment in 2006 which was later officially opened by [[Redcar]] athlete [[Tanni Grey-Thompson]].
