'''Donetsk Oblast''',{{efn|{{langx|uk|Донецька область|Donetska oblast}}, {{IPA|uk|doˈnɛtsʲkɐ ˈɔblɐsʲtʲ|IPA}}, {{langx|ru|Донецкая область}}}} also referred to as '''Donechchyna''' ({{langx|uk|Донеччина}}, {{IPA|uk|doˈnɛtʃːɪnɐ|IPA}}), is an [[Oblasts of Ukraine|oblast]] in eastern [[Ukraine]]. It is Ukraine's most populous province, with around 4.1 million residents. Its [[capital city|administrative centre]] is [[Donetsk]], though due to the ongoing [[Russo-Ukrainian War]], the regional administration was moved to [[Kramatorsk]].<ref>[http://mw.ua/UKRAINE/kikhtenko-to-move-donetsk-administration-to-kramatorsk-and-to-leave-power-structures-in-mariupol-119_.html Kikhtenko to move Donetsk administration to Kramatorsk and to leave power structures in Mariupol] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019083422/http://mw.ua/UKRAINE/kikhtenko-to-move-donetsk-administration-to-kramatorsk-and-to-leave-power-structures-in-mariupol-119_.html |date=19 October 2017 }} ''Mirror Weekly, mw.ua''</ref> Historically, the region has been an important part of the [[Donbas]] region. From its creation in 1938 until November 1961, it bore the name ''Stalino Oblast'', in honour of [[Joseph Stalin]]. As part of the [[de-Stalinization]] process, it was renamed after the [[Donets]] river, the main artery of [[Eastern Ukraine]]. Its population is estimated at {{Ua-pop-est2021|4,100,280|.}}

The oblast is known for its [[urban sprawl]] of [[Donetsk]]–[[Makiivka]] and [[Horlivka]]–[[Yenakiieve]] and it is often associated with the coal mining industry.

In 2014, parts of the oblast, including Donetsk, came under the control of Russian-backed separatists who declared the [[Donetsk People's Republic]], leading to a [[War in Donbas (2014–2022)|war against government forces]]; the de facto administrative center was subsequently moved to [[Mariupol]] and then [[Kramatorsk]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Kikhtenko to move Donetsk administration to Kramatorsk and to leave power structures in Mariupol|url=http://mw.ua/UKRAINE/kikhtenko-to-move-donetsk-administration-to-kramatorsk-and-to-leave-power-structures-in-mariupol-119_.html|website=[[Dzerkalo Tyzhnia]]|access-date=3 November 2014|language=ru|archive-date=19 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019083422/http://mw.ua/UKRAINE/kikhtenko-to-move-donetsk-administration-to-kramatorsk-and-to-leave-power-structures-in-mariupol-119_.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]], the oblast again became the site of [[Eastern Ukraine campaign|heavy fighting]], and Russia later declared [[Annexation of Southern and Eastern Ukraine|the annexation]] of the entirety of the oblast as well as three other regions, though the annexation remains internationally unrecognized.

==History==
[[File:Sviatohirsk Lavra - 05.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sviatohirsk Lavra]], one of the oldest historical landmarks of Donetsk Oblast]]
Donetsk Oblast is located within the historic regions of [[Zaporizhzhia (region)|Zaporizhzhia]] (western and central part), [[Sloboda Ukraine]] (northern part) and [[Pryazovia]] (southern part). In the mid-18th-century, the north-eastern outskirts formed part of [[Slavo-Serbia]] with its capital in [[Bakhmut]].

Before the establishment of Donetsk Oblast, three districts ([[Okruhas of the Ukrainian SSR|okruhas]]) existed on its territory from 1923 to 1930. The [[Donets Governorate]] was terminated in 1925. As part of [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine]], Donetsk Oblast was established on 2 July 1932 out of the [[Kharkiv Oblast]], the [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]], and a number of raions that were under the direct administration of [[Kharkiv]] (then-capital of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]). Artemivsk (today [[Bakhmut]]) served as the oblast's administrative center for two weeks until 16 July 1932, when the city of Stalino (today [[Donetsk]]) took on the role. Until 1938, the Donetsian Oblast included the territories of the modern Donetsk Oblast and the [[Luhansk Oblast]]. In June 1938 it was split into the Stalino Oblast (modern Donetsk Oblast) and the Voroshylovhrad Oblast (modern Luhansk Oblast).

During the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Nazi German occupation]] from fall 1941 to fall 1943, Donetsk Oblast was known as Yuzivka Oblast (after the original name of Donetsk). During [[World War II]], it was the site of several war crimes, including the German-perpetrated [[Artemivsk massacre]] and Soviet-perpetrated [[Massacre of Grischino]].

As part of [[de-Stalinization]] in the [[Soviet Union]], in 1961 Stalino and Stalino Oblast were renamed Donetsk and Donetsk Oblast. 

During the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], 83.9% of voters in Donetsk Oblast approved Ukraine's declaration of independence in the [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum|1991 referendum]].<ref name=UKrW812991>{{cite news |url= http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1991/499101.shtml |title= Independence – over 90% vote yes in referendum; Kravchuk elected president of Ukraine] |work= [[The Ukrainian Weekly]] |date= 8 December 1991 |access-date= 4 January 2017 |archive-date= 19 October 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171019083729/http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1991/499101.shtml |url-status= dead }}</ref>

In the mid-1990s, the region became known for its heightened criminal activity, including the killings of high-profile business people such as [[Akhat Bragin]] and [[Yevhen Shcherban]]. Donetsk Oblast was also a base for Ukraine's main pro-Russian political faction, [[Party of Regions]], which became part of the Ukrainian government in 2002 and paved a way into Ukrainian politics for the powerful "[[Donetsk Clan]]".

In late 2004, the Party of Regions was involved in the creation of a political project, the [[South-East Ukrainian Autonomous Republic]], which was intended to include Donetsk Oblast. Having close ties with the Russian government, the Party of Regions, along with local communists and other pro-Russian activists, instigated the [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|pro-Russian unrest]] which escalated into the [[War in Donbas (2014–2022)|war in Donbas]]. In May 2014, the Ukrainian government lost control over its border with Russia in Donetsk Oblast.

On 30 September 2022 Russia, amid its [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|invasion of Ukraine]], [[Annexation of Southern and Eastern Ukraine|annexed]] Donetsk ([[Donetsk People's Republic]]), [[Luhansk Oblast|Luhansk]] ([[Luhansk People's Republic]]), [[Zaporizhzhia Oblast|Zaporizhzhia]], and [[Kherson Oblast|Kherson]] Oblasts. The [[United Nations]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] subsequently passed a [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-11/4|resolution]] calling on countries not to recognise what it described as an "attempted illegal annexation", demanded that Russia "immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw",<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ukraine: UN General Assembly demands Russia reverse course on 'attempted illegal annexation' |date=12 October 2022 |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/10/1129492 |access-date=14 October 2022 |archive-date=14 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221014092342/https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/10/1129492 |url-status=live }}</ref> while most nations of the world have not recognized the annexations. As of April 2024, Russia controls about 60% of the oblast.<ref name="s376"/>

==Geography==
[[File:Donetsk oblast detail map.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Detailed map of Donetsk Oblast]]

Donetsk Oblast is located in southeastern Ukraine. The area of the oblast (26,517&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) comprises about 4.4% of the total area of the country. The oblast borders the [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast|Dnipropetrovsk]] and [[Zaporizhzhia Oblast]]s to the southwest, the [[Kharkiv Oblast]] to the north, the [[Luhansk Oblast]] to the northeast, the [[Rostov Oblast]] in Russia to the east, and the [[Sea of Azov]] to the south.

Its extent from north to south is 270&nbsp;km, from east to west – 190&nbsp;km. The extreme points of the oblast's borders are: [[Bilosarayska Kosa]] ([[Spit (landform)|spit]]) in the south, Shevchenko of Volnovakha Raion in the west, Verkhnii Kut of Horlivka Raion in the east, and Lozove of Kramatorsk Raion in the north.

The state historic-architectural site near the city of [[Sviatohirsk]] with the [[Sviatohirsk Lavra]] was nominated for the [[Seven Wonders of Ukraine]].

==Administrative divisions==
{{main|Administrative divisions of Donetsk Oblast}}

Since 2020, Donetsk Oblast has been divided into eight [[raions]] (districts), each named after its administrative center:

==Demographics==
[[File:2013. Донецк 550.jpg|thumb|Young family in Donetsk]]
