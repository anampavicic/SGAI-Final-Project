It is the second-largest city in the state after [[Cologne]] and the [[List of cities in Germany with more than 100,000 inhabitants|seventh-largest city in Germany]],{{efn|after [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], [[Munich]], [[Cologne]], and [[Frankfurt]]}} with a 2022 population of 629,047.<ref>1,525,029 inhabitants for the Düsseldorf [[Larger Urban Zone]]</ref>

The [[Düssel]], from which the city and the borough of [[Düsseltal]] take their name, divides into four separate branches within the city,{{efn|From north to south: Kittelbach, Nördliche Düssel, Südliche Düssel, Brückerbach}} each with its own mouth into the [[Rhine]] ([[Lower Rhine]]). Most of Düsseldorf lies on the right bank of the Rhine, and the city has grown together with [[Neuss]], [[Ratingen]], [[Meerbusch]], [[Erkrath]] and [[Monheim am Rhein]]. Düsseldorf is the central city of the metropolitan region [[Rhine-Ruhr]], the [[List of EU metropolitan areas by GDP|second biggest metropolitan region by GDP]] in the European Union, that stretches from [[Bonn]] via [[Cologne]] and Düsseldorf to the [[Ruhr]] (from [[Duisburg]] via [[Essen]] to [[Dortmund]]).

The ''-dorf'' suffix means "village" in German (English [[cognate]]: ''[[thorp]]''); its use is unusual for a settlement as large as Düsseldorf. Linguistically, Düsseldorf is the largest city in the German part of the [[Low Franconian]] area, dialects that are closely related to [[Dutch language|Dutch]].

==History==
{{for timeline|Timeline of Düsseldorf}}

===Early development===
When the [[Roman Empire]] was strengthening its position throughout Europe, a few [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] clung on in [[marsh]]y territory off the eastern banks of the [[Rhine]].<ref>Weidenhaupt, Hugo: ''Kleine Geschichte der Stadt Düsseldorf'', Triltsch-Verlag, Düsseldorf 1979; {{ISBN|3-7998-0000-X}}. {{in lang|de}}</ref> In the 7th and 8th centuries, the odd [[Agriculture|farming]] or [[fishing]] settlement could be found at the point where the small river [[Düssel]] flows into the Rhine. It was from such settlements that the city of Düsseldorf grew.

The first written mention of Düsseldorf (then called ''Dusseldorp'' in the local [[Meuse-Rhenish|Low Rhenish]] dialect) dates back to 1135. Under [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa]] the small town of [[Düsseldorf-Kaiserswerth|Kaiserswerth]] to the north of Düsseldorf became a well-fortified outpost, where soldiers kept a watchful eye on every movement on the Rhine. Kaiserswerth eventually became a suburb of Düsseldorf in 1929. 

In 1186, Düsseldorf came under the rule of the Counts of [[County of Berg|Berg]]. 14 August 1288 is one of the most important dates in the history of Düsseldorf, the day the sovereign Count [[Adolf VIII of Berg]] granted [[town privileges]] to the village on the banks of the Düssel. Before this, a [[War of the Limburg Succession|bloody struggle for power]] had taken place between the [[Archbishop of Cologne]] and his allies arrayed against the count of [[County of Berg|Berg]] and other local powers, culminating in the [[Battle of Worringen]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The Archbishop of Cologne's forces were wiped out by the forces of the count of [[County of Berg|Berg]], who were supported by citizens and farmers of Cologne and Düsseldorf, paving the way for Düsseldorf's elevation to city status, which is commemorated today by a monument on the Burgplatz. 

After this battle the relationship between Cologne and Düsseldorf deteriorated, because they were commercial rivals; it is often said that there is a kind of hostility between the citizens of Cologne and Düsseldorf. Today, it finds its expression mainly in a humorous form (especially during the Rhineland ''[[carnival|Karneval]]'') and in sports.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The custom of turning cartwheels is credited to the children of Düsseldorf. There are variations of the origin{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}} of the cartwheeling children. Today the symbol (Der Radschläger){{Citation needed|date=January 2023}} represents the story and every year the Düsseldorfers celebrate by having a cartwheeling contest. 

A [[market square]] sprang up on the banks of the Rhine and the square was protected by [[Defensive wall|city walls]] on all four sides. In 1380, the dukes of [[Duchy of Berg|Berg]] moved their seat to the town and Düsseldorf was made regional capital of the Duchy of Berg. During the following centuries several famous landmarks were built, including the {{ill|Collegiate Church of St Lambertus|de|St. Lambertus (Düsseldorf)}}. In 1609, the ducal line of the [[United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg]] died out, and after a violent struggle over succession, Jülich and Berg fell to the [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach]] Counts of [[Palatinate-Neuburg]], who made Düsseldorf their main domicile, even after they inherited the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], in 1685, becoming now [[Prince-elector]]s as Electors Palatine.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Under the art-loving [[Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine|Johann Wilhelm II]] (r. 1690–1716), a vast [[art museum|art gallery]], with a huge selection of paintings and sculptures, was housed in the ''Stadtschloss'' (city castle). After his death, the city fell on hard times again, especially after Elector [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Charles Theodore]] inherited Bavaria and moved the electoral court to [[Munich, Germany|Munich]]. With him he took the [[collection (museum)|art collection]], which became part of what is now the [[Alte Pinakothek]] in Munich. 

Destruction and poverty struck Düsseldorf after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. [[Napoleon]] made Berg a [[Grand Duchy of Berg|Grand Duchy]] and Düsseldorf its capital. [[Johann Christian Claudius Devaranne|Johann Devaranne]], a leader of [[Solingen]]'s resistance to Napoleon's conscription decrees, was executed here in 1813. 

After Napoleon's defeat, the whole [[Rhineland]] including Berg was given to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1815. The [[Rhine Province]]'s parliament was established in Düsseldorf.{{When|date=December 2014}} By the mid-19th century, Düsseldorf enjoyed a revival thanks to the [[Industrial Revolution]] as the city boasted 100,000 inhabitants by 1882; the figure doubled in 1892.

===World War I===
During [[World War I]] the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] (RNS) undertook the first [[Entente Powers|Entente]] strategic bombing missions on 22 September 1914, when it bombed the Zeppelin bases in Düsseldorf.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Madison |first=Rodney |title=Air Warfare, Strategic Bombing |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of World War I: A Political, Social and Military History |volume=1 |location=Santa Barbara |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2005 |pages=45–46 |isbn=1851094202}}; {{cite encyclopedia |last=Tilford | first=Earl H.

===Weimar Republic===
In 1920, Düsseldorf became the centre of the [[Ruhr uprising|General Strike]] that grew out of the resistance to the [[Kapp Putsch]]. On 15 April 1920, 45 delegates of the German Miners Union were murdered by the [[Freikorps]].<ref>Birchall, Ian H./Pierre Broué/Brian Pearce, ''The German Revolution 1917–1923'', p. 278.<!-- publishing info; ISBN needed --></ref>

The city was a target of [[strategic bombing during World War II]], particularly during the [[battle of the Ruhr|RAF bombing campaign in 1943]] when over 700 bombers were used in a single night. Raids continued late into the war. As part of [[Oil Campaign of World War II|the campaign against German oil facilities]], the RAF raid of 20–21 February, 1945 on the Rhenania Ossag refinery in the Reisholz district of the city halted oil production there. 

The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Düsseldorf in mid-April 1945. The [[97th Infantry Division (United States)|United States 97th Infantry Division]] easily captured the city on 18 April 1945,<ref>Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939–1946'' (Revised Edition, 2006), Stackpole Books, p. 174.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref> after the local [[German resistance to Nazism|German Resistance]] group launched [[Aktion Rheinland]].

===German Federal Republic===
In 1946, Düsseldorf was made capital of the new [[Federation|federal state]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. The city's reconstruction proceeded at a frantic pace and the economic transformation guided Düsseldorf's economic growth.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Geography==

===Physical geography===
[[File:Düssel.png|thumb|The course of the Düssel from its source in the Düssel Hill Country (Düsselhügelland) ([[:de:Düsselhügelland|de]]) through the [[Neandertal (valley)|Neandertal]] to Düsseldorf, where it forms three [[River bifurcation|bifurcations]], dividing into the four branches (from north to south) Kittelbach, Nördliche Düssel, Südliche Düssel and Brückerbach]]
[[File:Düsseldorf Panorama.jpg|thumb|Düsseldorf skyline]]
Düsseldorf lies at the centre of the [[Lower Rhine]] basin, where the delta of the [[Düssel]] flows into the Rhine. The city lies on the east side of the Rhine, except [[District 4, Düsseldorf|District 4]] ([[Düsseldorf-Oberkassel|Oberkassel]], [[Düsseldorf-Niederkassel|Niederkassel]], [[Düsseldorf-Heerdt|Heerdt]] and [[Düsseldorf-Lörick|Lörick]]). Across the Rhine, the city of [[Neuss]] stands on the delta of the [[Erft]]. Düsseldorf lies southwest of the [[Ruhr]] urban area, and in the middle of the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] metropolitan region.

Düsseldorf is built entirely on [[alluvium]], mud, sand, clay and occasionally gravel. The highest point in Düsseldorf is the top of Sandberg in the far eastern part of the city ([[Düsseldorf-Hubbelrath|Hubbelrath]] borough) at {{convert|165|m|ft|0}}. The lowest point is at the far northern end in [[Düsseldorf-Wittlaer|Wittlaer]] borough where the Schwarzbach enters the Rhine, with an average elevation of {{convert|28|m|ft|0}}.

There are five pub-breweries in Düsseldorf which brew Altbier on the premises: Füchschen, Schumacher, Schlüssel, Uerige and Brauerei Kürzer. Four of the five are in the historic centre of Düsseldorf (Altstadt); the other (Schumacher), between the Altstadt and Düsseldorf Central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), also maintains an establishment in the Altstadt, Im Goldenen Kessel, across the street from Schlüssel.

Each (except Brauerei Kürzer) produces a special, secret, seasonal "Sticke" version in small quantities, though the names vary: Schlüssel spells it "Stike", without the "c", while Schumacher calls its special beer "Latzenbier", meaning "slat beer", possibly because the kegs from which it was poured had been stored on raised shelves.<ref name="Dornbusch">Horst Dornbusch, ''Altbier'', Boulder, CO: Brewers Publications.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref> Füchschen's seasonal is its Weihnachtsbier (Christmas beer), available in bottles starting mid-November, and served in the brewpub on [[Christmas Eve]].<ref name="Fuchschen Weihnachtsbier">{{cite web|url=http://www.fuechschen.de/htmlGB/start-frames-61.html |title=Fuchschen webpage on Weihnachtsbier |access-date=27 April 2007 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080127112721/http://www.fuechschen.de/htmlGB/start-frames-61.html |archive-date=27 January 2008 }}</ref>

=== Fashion ===
Düsseldorf has been the [[fashion]] capital of Germany [[History of Germany (1945–1990)|for decades]]; it is also a major cultural center for the art scene. Berlin, Germany's 'fashion capital' until 1945, lost its position because of its [[History of Berlin|special location]] within the [[Soviet occupation zone]]. After the [[monetary reform]] of June 20, 1948, fashionable clothes trends gained importance. [[Igedo]] organised fashion shows staged in Düsseldorf starting in March 1949.<ref>''Verkaufs- und Modewoche Düsseldorf'' (source: [[Der Spiegel]] [https://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-44445899.html 2/1950] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224145426/https://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-44445899.html |date=24 February 2021 }})</ref>

===Carnival===
{{main|Carnival in Germany, Switzerland and Austria#Rhineland}}
[[File:Düsseldorf Karneval 2013 (8465441391).jpg|thumb|[[Carnival|Carnival in Düsseldorf]]]]
One of the biggest cultural events in Düsseldorf is the ''[[Carnival|Karneval]]'' (also referred to as the "fifth season") which starts every year on 11 November at 11:11&nbsp;a.m., and reaches its climax on ''[[Rosenmontag]]'' (Rose Monday), featuring a huge parade through the streets of Düsseldorf. ''Karneval'' ends on ''Aschermittwoch'' ([[Ash Wednesday]]).

===Düsseldorf's cartwheeler===
{{Main|Düsseldorf's cartwheeler}}
The ''Düsseldorfer Radschläger'' (''boy who does [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheels]]'') is said to be the city's oldest tradition. The symbol of the cartwheeler can be found on souvenirs and various things in Düsseldorf have cartwheelers to thank for their names.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==== Legends of its origin and history ====
{{More citations needed section|date=December 2014}}
The tradition cannot be linked to one specific historical event. Instead, there are several stories surrounding the beginnings of the Düsseldorf cartwheelers. Probably the most well known version is the [[Battle of Worringen]]. In the battle of 1288, [[Adolf VIII of Berg|Count Adolf]] devastatingly defeated the [[Archbishop]] of [[Cologne]]. As a consequence of this victory, Düsseldorf obtained [[town privileges]]. Inhabitants, especially children, ran joyfully on the streets and performed [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheels]].

Another story talks about a wedding procession during which one of the wheels of the wedding carriage broke. In order to fend off the threat of bad luck, a boy supposedly jumped up to the carriage, took hold of the wheel and thus became a living part of the wheel. Whether the story is about the marriage of [[Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine|Jan Wellem]] and [[Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici]] or the wedding of Margravine [[Jakobea of Baden]] and [[John William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg|Johann Wilhelm]] is debatable.

Another story gives an account of the wedding between Margrave Jacobe von Baden and Johann Wilhelm in 1585. According to legend, she felt miserable about her marriage, but the cartwheelers who displayed their skills next to her carriage were able to make her smile. Numerous travelers were attracted to the city by great exhibitions – the forerunner of today's fairs – between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. During this time the children who did cartwheels found out that it was a profitable source of income. The bourgeoisie accepted this in good humour as a symbolic act of local patriotism. In the beginning the lads shouted ''"för eene Penning schlage ich das Rad"'' (a cartwheel for a penny). 

The Jan Wellem monument returned to Düsseldorf at the end of the Second World War. The procession was accompanied by torches, fanfares and cartwheeling boys.

=====Cartwheelers in the cityscape=====
Cartwheelers can be found at several fountains within the city and near many small landmarks. The most famous is Cartwheeler's Fountain in ''Burgplatz'' ([[:de:Burgplatz (Düsseldorf)|de]]) with an inscription of a quote by Hans Müller-Schlösser: "''Radschläger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve''" (We will always remain cartwheelers, however crazy it drives people.) The fountain was designed by Alfred Zschorsch in 1954 and donated by ''Heimatverein Düsseldorfer Jonges'', which is a club devoted to the maintenance of local and regional traditions. There are other cartwheelers that decorate storm drains and the [[door knocker]] on the Church of Lambertus, designed by Friedrich Becker. He created the cartwheeler in front of the Schadow Arcades.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The tradition has been kept alive by the ''Alde Düsseldorfer Bürgergesellschaft von 1920 e. V.'', a society founded in 1920, which organized the first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. This event has been held annually since 1971<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.christmasmarkets.com/individual-christmas-market/dusseldorf-christmas-market/|title=Düsseldorf Christmas Market {{!}} Christmas Markets|newspaper=Christmas Markets|access-date=9 November 2016|archive-date=9 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109224141/http://www.christmasmarkets.com/individual-christmas-market/dusseldorf-christmas-market/|url-status=live}}</ref> in cooperation with the ''Stadtsparkasse'' (a local bank). Formerly held in the ''[[Königsallee]]'', it has taken place since 2006 on the ''Rheinwerft'', near the old part of town. This is a fixed date in the city's calendar of events. About 500 boys regularly participate in the event and girls have also taken part since 1971. In an art project ''Radschläger-Kunst'' (Cartwheeler Art) launched in 2001, over 100 cartwheeler sculptures were designed by various artists. The door knocker on the Church of Lambertus<ref>[[:de:St. Lambertus (Düsseldorf)#/media/Datei:Radschläger-Türklopfer an St. Lambertus in Düsseldorf.jpg|picture]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=August 2020}} served as a model for the sculptures that are {{convert|2|m|0|abbr=off}} high, {{convert|2|m|0|abbr=off}} wide and {{convert|30|cm|0|abbr=on}} deep. They were positioned around the city centre. Some of the sculptures have been auctioned off to companies and private owners.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

=== Christmas market ===
Every [[Christmas]], the city of Düsseldorf uses the city centre to host one of the largest Christmas gatherings in Germany. The Christmas festival occurs every year from 17 November until 23 December. This Christmas fest brings Düsseldorf a large portion of tourism every year as many people from nearby areas come to the city to drink [[mulled wine]] and hot chocolate and watch craftsmen [[Glassblowing|blow glass]] and create art. The event takes place among many small wooden buildings all clustered in the middle of the city for all the citizens to enjoy. The event, to many visitors, has an old European feel, but is very lively.

===Cuisine===
[[File:Himmel und Erde (2).jpg|thumb|[[Himmel und Erde|Himmel un Äd]], "Heaven and Earth"]]
Traditional meals in the region are Rheinischer [[Sauerbraten]] (a beef roast and sometimes horse marinated for a few days in vinegar and spices served with gravy and raisins) and [[Himmel und erde|Heaven and Earth]] (Himmel und Äd; [[black pudding]] with stewed apples mixed with [[mashed potato]]es). In winter the people like to eat Muscheln Rheinischer Art (Rhenish-style mussels) as well as [[Reibekuchen]] (fried potato pancake served with apple sauce). Also a special meal: Düsseldorfer Senfrostbraten (Steaks roasted with Düsseldorf mustard on top).

Düsseldorf is known for its strong [[Dijon mustard|Dijon]]-like [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]] served in a traditional pot called "Mostertpöttche", which was immortalised in a [[still life]] by [[Vincent van Gogh]] in 1884.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://duesseldorf-altstadt.blogspot.com/2007/01/van-gogh-stilleben-mit-abb-senf.html |title=Düsseldorf Altstadt: Van Gogh, Stilleben mit ABB-Senf |publisher=Duesseldorf-altstadt.blogspot.com |date=25 January 2007 |access-date=5 May 2009}}</ref>
