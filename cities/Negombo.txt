'''Negombo''' ({{Langx|si|මීගමුව|translit=Mīgamuva}}, {{Langx|ta|நீர்கொழும்பு|translit=Nīrkoḻumpu}}) is a major city in [[Sri Lanka]], situated on the west coast and at the mouth of the [[Negombo Lagoon]], in the [[Western Province, Sri Lanka|Western Province]], {{convert|38|km|abbr=on}} from Colombo via the [[E03 expressway (Sri Lanka)|Colombo–Katunayake Expressway]] and the nearest major city from the [[Bandaranaike International Airport]] (about 9&nbsp;km distance).

Negombo is one of the major commercial hubs in the country and the administrative centre of Negombo Division. Negombo has a population of about 142,136 within its [[Negombo Divisional Secretariat|divisional secretariat division]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.lk/PopHouSat/CPH2011/Pages/Activities/Reports/District/Gampaha/A4.pdf|title=Census of Population and Housing of Sri Lanka, 2012|publisher=Department of Census and Statistics, Sri Lanka|page=1}}</ref> Negombo municipal boundary is fully extended throughout its Divisional Secretariat area.

Negombo is known for its long sandy beaches and centuries old [[fishing]] industry. Negombo has a large bilingual (Sinhala/Tamil) population with a clear [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] majority.

== Etymology ==
The name "Negombo" is the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] corruption of its [[Tamil language|Tamil]] name ''Neerkolombu''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ul9kAAAAMAAJ|title=Proceedings|date=1968|publisher=International Association of Tamil Research, Department of Indian Studies, University of Malaya|pages=481|language=en}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|Excerpt for the etymology of Negombo from "Proceedings".

The Sinhala name {{lang|si-Latn|Migamuva}} comes from old Tamil, மீகமன் பட்டினம் - mīgamaṉ paṭṭiṉam, a naval terminology. {{citation needed|date=January 2022}} Meegaman denotes Naval Captain, where the local Karava population's long association of Naval and Fishing connections.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}} Later,  "Village of the honeycomb", gaining its name from a legend mentioned in [[Rajaveliya]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X9TeEcMi0e0C&q=migamuva&pg=PA96|title=The Story of the Sinhalese from the Most Ancient Times Up to the End of "the Mahavansa" Or Great Dynasty: Vijaya to Maha Sena, B.C. 543 to A.D.302|last=Senaveratna|first=John M.|date=1997|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=9788120612716|pages=96|language=en}}</ref> The army of King Kavantissa found bee honey in a canoe near the seashore, for [[Viharamahadevi]] who was pregnant with the prince [[Dutugamunu]].

== History ==
The shallow waters of the [[Negombo Lagoon]] provided safe shelter for seafaring vessels and became one of the key ports along with [[Kalpitiya]], [[Puttalam]], [[Colombo]], [[Kalutara]] and [[Galle]], from which the Sri Lankan kingdoms conducted external trade.<ref>{{cite book|last=De Silva|first=K|title=A History of Sri Lanka|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_dByI_qil26YC|year=1981 |publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-04320-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_dByI_qil26YC/page/n105 89]–91}}</ref>

=== Pre-colonialism ===
The region was under the rule of the sinhala monarchy based on sri jayawardanapura kotte. The language used in the area was a regional dialect of sinhala when the [[Portuguese Ceylon|Portuguese]] arrived in the 16th century.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uw9uAAAAMAAJ|title=Coromandel fishermen: an ethnography of Paṭṭaṇavar subcaste|last=Pārati|first=Paktavatcala|date=1999|publisher=Pondicherry Institute of Linguistics and Culture|isbn=9788185452098|pages=9|language=en}}</ref>

Negombo also served as a shelter for Arabic vessels, whose descendants are the [[Sri Lankan Moors]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2pURAAAAMAAJ|title=A Regional Geography of Ceylon|last=Silva|first=S.

=== Portuguese Ceylon ===
Landing in the early 1500s, the Portuguese overthrew the sinhala monarchy who were forced to relocate to Sithawaka. The Portuguese constructed a fort in Negombo and took over the trade of cinnamon to the west.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gv1TAAAAYAAJ|title=Epigraphia Zeylanica: Being Lithic and Other Inscriptions of Ceylon|date=1973|publisher=Printed at the Department of Government Printing, Sri Lanka (Ceylon) for the Archeological Department|pages=86|language=en}}</ref> During the Portuguese occupation, the [[Karava]] (the dominant seafaring clan of Negombo), who were previously [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] were converted into [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZrBAAQAAIAAJ|title=Chicago Anthropology Exchange|date=1987|publisher=Department of Anthropology, University of Chicago|pages=54|language=en}}</ref> Due to the sheer amount of conversions to Catholicism, present-day Negombo is sometimes known as 'Little Rome' due to nearly two thirds of its population being Catholic.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tv9OAQAAIAAJ&q=negombo+little+rome|title=International political science abstracts|date=1970|pages=102|language=en}}</ref>

The Portuguese restructured the traditional production and management of cinnamon and maintained their control over the trade for more than a century. The decline of their power began in the 1630s when warfare between the Portuguese and the [[Kingdom of Kandy]] reached a stalemate. The King of Kandy turned to the Dutch for help.<ref>{{cite book|last=Newitt|first=Marlyn|title=A history of Portuguese overseas expansion, 1400–1668|year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York|pages=234}}</ref>

===Dutch Ceylon===
[[File:AMH-6153-NA Bird's eye view of Negombo.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Johannes Vingboons]] of the [[Negombo fort|Dutch fort]] in Negombo, {{circa}} 1665]]
The Dutch captured Negombo from the Portuguese in 1646 and negotiated an armistice with Portugal for ten years. During this period, the King of Kandy sought to provoke conflict between the nations by passing through the territories of the one to attack the other. On one occasion, he captured the fort of Negombo and sent the head of the Dutch commander, Adrian Vander Stell, to his countrymen in [[Galle]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Tennent|first=James|title=Ceylon: an account of the island physical, historical and topographical, with notices of its natural history, antiquities, and productions, Volume 2|year=1860 |publisher=Longman, Green, Longman and Roberts|location=London |pages=44}}</ref> Although the Dutch managed to regain control of Negombo from the King by diplomatic means, hostilities continued. In particular, the disruption of the cinnamon trade was a favourite method of the King to harass the Dutch.<ref>{{cite book|last=Obeyesekere|first=Donald|title=Outlines of Ceylon history|year=1999|publisher=Asian Educational Services|location=Neh Delhi|pages=257}}</ref>

Throughout the eighteenth century, the demand for cinnamon from Ceylon outstripped the supply, and its quality appeared to have suffered. Other factors, including the continued hostility from the Kandyan Kingdom and a rival cinnamon exporter in the form of China, led to a 40% decline in the volume of cinnamon exported between 1785 and 1791, despite attempts to clear land around Negombo and create cinnamon plantations.

The legacy of the Dutch colonial era can be seen in the [[Negombo fort]], constructed in 1672, and other Dutch buildings, including churches and the extensive canal system that runs {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Colombo in the south, through Negombo to Puttalam in the north.

===British Ceylon===
By the time the British commander [[James Stuart (British Army officer, born 1741)|Colonel Stuart]] took over the cinnamon trade in 1796, it was clear that the industry was in decline. Poor policies put in place by [[Frederick North, 5th Earl of Guilford|Frederick North]] the first [[Governor of British Ceylon]] exacerbated the problem. By the 1830s, commercial interest had moved elsewhere.

Following the British takeover of the Kingdom of Kandy in 1815, Negombo lost its strategic value as an outpost of Colombo. However, it continued to develop in commercial influence. The Negombo fishery was at the heart of the seafood trade in Ceylon, and many migrant fisherman arrived annually with the profits of their ventures going into the small, prosperous town. In 1907 Negombo was connected to the massive railway project that was linking the island together under British control and encouraging the growth of plantations in coconuts, tea and coffee.

== Geography ==
[[File:Flickr - ronsaunders47 - SRI LANKAN FISHING BOAT. 2.jpg|thumb|A traditional fishing boat]]
Negombo is about {{convert|2|m|0}} above sea level, and Negombo's geography is a mix of land and water. The [[Hamilton Canal]] flows in the heart of the city. The [[Negombo Lagoon]] is one of the most scenic landmarks of Negombo. There are over 190 species of wildlife and plenty of birds in its mangroves. The northern border of the city is formed by the [[Maha Oya]] river which meets the [[Indian Ocean]].

===Climate===
Negombo features a [[tropical rainforest climate]] under the [[Köppen climate classification]]. The city receives rainfall mainly from the Southwestern monsoons from May to August and October to January. During the remaining months there is a little precipitation due to [[Convective]] rains. The average annual precipitation is about {{convert|2,400|mm|0}}. The average temperature varies {{convert|24|C|0}} to {{convert|30|C|0}}, and there are high humidity levels from February to April.

{{main|Negombo Lagoon}}

[[File:SL Negombo asv2020-01 img02 Dutch canal.jpg|thumb|Built by the Dutch to transport spices, now used by the local fisherman to get to the sea, [[Hamilton Canal|Dutch canal]] in Negombo]]

The Negombo lagoon is large semi-enclosed coastal water body with plenty of natural resources. The lagoon is fed by number of small rivers and the [[Hamilton Canal]] (also known as the Dutch canal). It is linked to the Indian Ocean by a narrow channel to the north, near Negombo. The lagoon and the marsh land area also support local agriculture and forestry. It has extensive mangrove swamps and attracts a wide variety of water birds. The lagoon supports so many distinct species of flora, fauna and as well as another species of birds and variety of animals. [[Negombo Lagoon]] is a major local and tourist attraction primarily for sightseeing and boating tours.

The fishermen who are based at the Negombo lagoon live in shanty [[thatch palm]] villages along the water's edge. They rely mainly on their traditional knowledge of the seasons for their livelihood, using [[outrigger canoe]]s carved out of tree trunks and nylon nets to bring in modest catches from September through April. Their boats are made in two forms – oruvas (a type of [[sailing canoe]]) and paruvas (a large, man-powered [[catamaran]] fitted with kurlon dividers). In recent years, the villagers have supplemented the income earned from fishing by collecting 'toddy', or palm sap, which is used to brew [[Arrack (drink)|arrack]].<ref name="gv" />
