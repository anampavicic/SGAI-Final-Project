It was renamed Central Equatoria in the first Interim Legislative Assembly on 1 April 2005 under the [[government of Southern Sudan (2005–2011)|government of Southern Sudan]]. Central Equatoria seceded from [[Sudan]] as part of the [[South Sudan|Republic of South Sudan]] on 9 July 2011. The state's capital, [[Juba]], is also the national capital of [[South Sudan]]. On October 2, 2015, the state was split into three states: [[Jubek State|Jubek]], [[Terekeka State|Terekeka]], and [[Yei River State|Yei River]].

|In terms of tribes in Central Equatoria, we have Mundari of Terekeka County, the Pojulu of Lainya, Wonduruba and Tijor counties combined, and the Bari of Juba County, who are the largest. Then we have the Kuku from Kajok Keji County, Nyangwara from Rokon area – then we have the Kakwa, from Yei County and Morobo, then there is the Keliko from Morobo County, the Avokaya, Mundo and Baka from Tore Payam of Yei County. Additionally, there are the Pojulu-Tijor who are near Tali.

So, these tribes are the eight tribes who speak one language with slight differences, [[Kutuk language|Kutuk]], although they all have different traditional dances. Mundari language for example has its own notion tone different from Bari but they also speak Bari at the same time because some of the border the Bari to the north of Juba, although there are differences in some of the words. Some of the tribes like Avokaya of Yei County, Lugbara and Keliko of Morobo speak one language with slight differences except Mundo and Baka which speak different languages. But they all also have their special languages, called their ‘Kobura’ which the others do not understand. It is a hidden language, they speak it during danger.

They are all from one family but got separated because of land, the land was not enough. They were at first were pastoralists, and then diverged as pastoralists and agriculturalists.

Then there is also the Direr or Nubi, these people are a collection of tribes and their religion is Islam. They settled together in two main places, Malakia in Juba and Bombo which is near Kampala in Uganda. They are united by their religion, which came to them in the 1940s. They now consider themselves to be a new tribe.

The agriculturalists out of these are the Bari,Kuku, the Kakwa, Avokaya, Mundo, Pojulu, Lokoya, Lulubo, Nyangwara, Keliko, Nyepo. They grow a variety of crops, including maize, cassava, sweet potatoes, 'bolot or sorghum, millet,  groundnuts, beans.cow peas, yams These tribes have two crops to harvest every year, the first in June or July and the second in November or December. They also keep small number of cattle, goats, and sheep and keep poultry,  duck and pigeons.

== Culture and languages ==
Due to the [[South Sudanese Civil War]], the state's culture was heavily influenced by the countries neighboring South Sudan. Many South Sudanese fled to [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]] and [[Uganda]], where they interacted with the nationals and learned their languages and culture. Most of those who remained in the country or went north to [[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]] assimilated into Arab culture.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

It is also worth noting that most South Sudanese diaspore kept the core of their culture even while in exile. Traditional culture is highly held and great attention is given to knowing one's origin and dialect. Although the common languages spoken are [[Juba Arabic]] and English, [[Swahili language|Swahili]] began to be introduced to the population to improve the country's relations with its [[East Africa]]n neighbors. Many people from Central Equatoria use English, Kiswahili, Juba Arabic, their dialect, or a mixture of the languages mentioned.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
