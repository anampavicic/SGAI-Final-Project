'''Morelos''' ({{IPA|es|moˈɾelos|-|Morelos3.ogg}}), officially the '''Free and Sovereign State of Morelos''' ({{langx|es|Estado Libre y Soberano de Morelos}}), is a landlocked state located in south-central Mexico. It is one of the 32 states which comprise the [[Political divisions of Mexico|Federal Entities]] of [[Mexico]]. It is divided into [[Municipalities of Morelos|36 municipalities]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://enserionoticias.com.mx/2018/07/26/solo-son-tres-los-nuevos-municipios-indigenas-en-morelos/|title=Sólo son tres los nuevos municipios indígenas en Morelos|publisher=En Serio Noticias|date=July 26, 2018|access-date=February 4, 2019|language=es|trans-title=There are only three new Indigenous municipalities in Morelos|archive-date=23 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181223030141/https://enserionoticias.com.mx/2018/07/26/solo-son-tres-los-nuevos-municipios-indigenas-en-morelos/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lajornadamorelos.com.mx/municipios/2018/07/26/2086|title=Solo aprobaron a tres nuevos Indigenous municipalities|date=July 26, 2018|access-date=Dec 22, 2018|language=es|trans-title=Only three new Indigenous municipalities approved|archive-date=August 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804073115/https://www.lajornadamorelos.com.mx/municipios/2018/07/26/2086|url-status=dead}}</ref> and its capital city is [[Cuernavaca]].

Morelos is bordered by [[Mexico City]] to the north, and by the states of [[State of Mexico|México]] to the northeast and northwest, [[Puebla]] to the east and [[Guerrero]] to the southwest.

Morelos is the second-smallest state in the nation, just after [[Tlaxcala]]. It was part of a very large province, the State of Mexico, until 1869 when [[Benito Juárez]] decreed that its territory would be separated and named in honor of [[José María Morelos y Pavón]], who [[Siege of Cuautla|defended the city]] of [[Cuautla, Morelos|Cuautla]] from royalist forces during the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. Most of the state enjoys a warm climate year-round, which is good for the raising of [[sugar cane]] and other crops. Morelos has attracted visitors from the [[Valley of Mexico]] since [[Aztec]] times.

The state is also known for the [[Chinelos]], a type of costumed dancer that appears at festivals, especially [[Carnival]], which is celebrated in a number of communities in the state. It is also home to the [[Monasteries on the slopes of Popocatépetl]], a designated [[World Heritage Site]].

==History==

===Pre-Hispanic period===

[[File:Xochicalcotempleofinscriptions.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Temple of the Feathered Serpent, Xochicalco]]
Historian Ward Barrett considers that the "region now known as Morelos has a physical unity sufficient to define and set it in strong contrast to other regions of Mexico."<ref>Ward Barrett, "Morelos and Its Sugar Industry in the Late Eighteenth Century," in Ida Altman and James Lockhart, ''The Provinces of Early Mexico: Variants of Spanish American Regional Evolution''. Los Angeles: UCLA Latin American Center 1976, p. 155.</ref><ref>Ward Barrett, ''Sugar Hacienda of the Marqueses del Valle.'' Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press 1970.</ref> Much of this definition comes from its geography, which is a basin into which abundant water flows. The arrival of the Spanish shifted agriculture from subsistence maize production and cotton cultivation to sugar cane and the refining of such into sugar in nearby mills. This system would remain more or less intact until the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref name="schmal" />

Evidence of the first human inhabitants in what is now Morelos dates back to 6000 B.C. and shows these people as nomadic hunters and gatherers in the areas of [[Yautepec de Zaragoza|Yautepec]] and ''Chimalacatlan''.<ref>Secretaria, p. 30</ref> Other early finds include clay jars and figures in the Gualupita neighborhood of Cuernavaca and three mounds in [[Santa María Ahuacatitlán]], which are probably the remains of houses.<ref name="morelos37" />

[[Francisco Plancarte y Navarrete]], Cuernavaca's second bishop (1898–1911), wrote ''Tamoanchan—El Estado de Morelos y El Principio de la Civilizacion en Mexico'' in 1911. In it, he proposes that the first agriculturally based settlements in Mexico appeared around 1500 B.C. in a place called ''Tamoanchan'' which he associates with Morelos.<ref name=morelos37>Secretaria, p. 37</ref><ref name=gobhistoria>{{cite web |url=http://www.e-morelos.gob.mx/index2.php?action=view&art_id=475 |title=Nuestra Historia |publisher=Government of Morelos |location=Morelos |language=es |trans-title=Our History |access-date=September 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618084545/http://www.e-morelos.gob.mx/index2.php?action=view&art_id=475 |archive-date=June 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> He writes, "1st - That being in the region of Tamoanchan... they fixed the ritual calendar ... 2nd - That Tamoanchan was not very far from Teotihuacan; 3rd - That to go from Tamoanchan to Teotihuacan they passed through Xumiltepec; 4th - That Tepuztecal (sic) and his companions discovered pulque in the Tamoanchan region. But as all these facts happened in... the State of Morelos ... and accordingly that Tamoanchan is not a mythological and fantastic country... but true..."<ref>Plancarte y Navarrete, Francisco. ''Tamoanchan—El Estado de Morelos y El Principio de la Civilizacion en Mexico'', Mexico: El Mensajero, 1911.</ref>

The earliest identified culture is the [[Olmec]], which was dominant from 200 B. C. to about A.D. 500. Evidence of this culture is found in reliefs such as those in the Cantera Mountain in [[Chalcatzingo]] and clay figures.<ref name=gobhistoria/>

After the Olmec period, the area was invaded by several waves of migration from the Valley of Mexico in the north. The settlement of [[Mazatepec, Morelos|Mazatepec]] was founded in A. D. 603 by the [[Toltecs]].<ref name=enchistoria>{{cite web |url=http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/morelos/ |title=Historia |year=2005 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de USA Estado de Morelos |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=History |access-date=September 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718114447/http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/morelos/ |archive-date=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> A second wave of [[Toltec]]s established the city-state of [[Xochicalco]] (the City of Flowers). Their influence is evident in [[Teotihuacan]] at the temple of [[Quetzalcoatl]], but there are also signs of [[Maya peoples|Mayan]], [[Mixtec]] and [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] influences.<ref name=gobhistoria/> The last wave of Toltecs arrived in the 12th century.<ref name=enchistoria/> There are two groups from this wave. The first to arrive were the [[Xochimilco (pre-Columbian city)|Xochimilcas]], who settled in places such as [[Tetela del Volcán|Tetela]], [[Hueyapan]], [[Tepoztlán]], and ''Xumiltepec''. Shortly afterwards the [[Tlahuicas]] arrived and settled in and around Cuauhnáhuac ([[Cuernavaca]]) by 1250.<ref name=gobhistoria/> There is evidence that indicates the ''Tlauhuicas'' probably would have been expelled from Morelos by the Xochimilcas if they had not been protected by [[Xolotl (Chichimec ruler)|Xólotl]], lord of [[Acolhua]], who granted territory to ''Tochintecutli'', the first lord of ''Cuauhnáhuac'' (Cuernavaca).<ref>Secretaria, p. 47</ref> The Tlahuicas are believed to be an offshoot of the Toltec-Chichimec group of [[Nahuatl]]-speaking peoples who have occupied the area since the seventh century.<ref name=schmal>{{cite web |url=http://www.houstonculture.org/mexico/morelos.html |author=John P.

The Tlahuica eventually became the dominant ethnic group in Morelos. They were organized into about fifty small city-states, each with a hereditary ruler ([[tlatoani]]). Each Tlahuica city-state consisted of a central town, with its temple, plaza, palace, and the surrounding countryside and villages. The largest of these were ''Cuauhnáhuac'' and ''Huaxtepec'' ([[Oaxtepec]]).<ref name=schmal/><ref name=jtaylor>{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1500-the-state-of-morelos-an-overview |title=The State Of Morelos – An Overview |author=Julia Taylor |date=January 1, 2008 |publisher=MexConnect |access-date=September 9, 2010 |archive-date=11 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211145341/http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1500-the-state-of-morelos-an-overview |url-status=live }}</ref> These people had advanced knowledge of astronomy and a highly developed agricultural system. They were especially known for growing cotton, which was planted wherever the land could be irrigated. Tlahuica women spun and wove cloth, which became an important item for exchange and for paying tribute.<ref name=schmal/>

The [[Mexica]] or [[Aztec]] began to arrive as early as 1398, but efforts to dominate this area began in the 1420s.<ref name=gobhistoria/><ref name=enchistoria/> In the 1420s and 1430s, ''Cuauhnáhuac'' and ''Xiutepec'' ([[Jiutepec]]) were conquered by [[Itzcoatl]].<ref name=enchistoria/> In the middle of the 15th century, other city-states in Morelos made war on Aztec-held Cuauhnahuac and the Aztecs used this as an excuse to conquer areas such as Yautepec, [[Tetlama]] and other locations, eventually dominating the entire state. The inclusion of the area into the [[Aztec Empire]] was sealed with marriage of Aztec emperor [[Huitzilihuitl]] to Miahuaxochitl, daughter of the lord of Cuauhnáhuac. This union produced a son who would become Aztec emperor [[Moctezuma Ilhuicamina]]. These conquered areas were allowed to keep their local political structures so long as a tribute, which mostly consisted of cotton items, was paid.<ref name=schmal/><ref>Secretaria, pp. 48–49</ref> The territory was divided into two tributary provinces, one centered on Cuauhnáhuac and the other centered on Huaxtepec.<ref name=gobhistoria/> Each of these territories had a population of over 50,000 by the 16th century.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web |url=http://morelos.gob.mx/?q=tepalcingo |title=Tepalcingo |website=morelos.gob.mx |access-date=Dec 21, 2018 |archive-date=December 21, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221230630/http://morelos.gob.mx/?q=tepalcingo |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Moctezuma Ilhuicamina succeeded Izcóatl, and tradition has it that he established a botanical garden in Huaxtepec ([[Oaxtepec]]). Moctezuma's favorite swimming area is thought to have been a pond called ''Poza Azul'', now part of a resort run by [[Six Flags Hurricane Harbor]].<ref name=morelos51>Secretaria de Educación Publica. ''Chipmunks: Monografía estatal: 1982'', p. 51</ref>

The Mexica built a number of fortifications in the area, notably in the hills called ''El Sombrerito'' and ''Tlatoani'' near [[Tlayacapan]]. The pyramid of [[Tepozteco]] in [[Tepoztlán]] may have been designed as a fort and lookout post. During this time, the Tlauhuica built the double-pyramid known as [[Teopanzolco]] in Cuernavaca.<ref>Secretaria, pp. 51–52</ref>

Population estimates for the beginning of the 16th century are: Cuauhnáhuac, 50,000; Huaxtepec, 50,000; Yautepec, 30,000; [[Tepoztlán]], 20,000; [[Totolapan]], 20,000; and 12,000 each for [[Tlayacapan]], Tetela, [[Yecapixtla]], and [[Ocuituco]].<ref>Secretaria, p. 53</ref><ref name="auto1"/>

The Spanish under [[Hernán Cortés]] arrived in central Mexico in 1519. After Cortés's defeat in [[Tenochtitlan]] ([[La Noche Triste]]) and retreat into [[Tlaxcala, Tlaxcala|Tlaxacala]] in 1520, he sent expeditions to Morelos. One of the first Mexicas to accept Spanish authority was in [[Ocuituco]]. [[Gonzalo de Sandoval]] then set out with 8,000 men for Huaxtepec ([[Oaxtepec]]). After a two-day fight, Sandoval returned to Texcoco to inform Cortes of his victory. Cortes returned with 20,000 men and defeated [[Tlayacapan]] on April 8. Cortes then went to Huaxtepec, spent a night in the beautiful gardens, and moved on to Yautepec. The Spanish burned the town, and [[Tepoztlan]] surrendered. Cortes continued his march on Xiutepec ([[Jiutepec]]) and on April 13 faced the city of Cuauhnahuac ([[Cuernavaca]]). The bridges across the Ravine of Annanalco had been destroyed, but both Cortes and [[Bernal Diaz del Castillo]] relate how they were able to cross the ravine upriver via a fallen tree. The ''cacique'' of Cuauhnahuac surrendered quickly, and Cortes burned and sacked the city, and the women were raped. After spending the night in nearby [[Acapantzingo, Cuernavaca|Acapantzingo]], Cortes moved on to ''Coajomulco'' before marching on [[Xochimilco]].<ref>Macarzaga, César and Catalina Ramírez. ''Morelos Espacio y Tiempo, Tercer grado,'' Editorial Trillas: Mexico, 3rd edition (2002), pp. 76-79.</ref> Cortes returned to Cuernavaca after the fall of Tenochtitlan,<ref name=gobhistoria/><ref name=enchistoria/> where he established a hacienda and constructed the [[Palace of Cortes, Cuernavaca|Palace of Cortés]] five years later.<ref name=enchistoria/>

In 1529, Cortés was named the [[Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca]], which gave him control over {{convert|4000|km2|abbr=on}} of territory in Morelos with Cuernavaca as the seat of authority over about eighty communities, eight haciendas, and two sugar cane plantations. These lands stayed in the Cortés family until 1809 when the government confiscated all of the lands of the Marquis.<ref name=gobhistoria/> There are house-to-house censuses from the mid-1530s from communities around Cuernavaca that are the earliest extant local-level documentation in [[Nahuatl]], likely due to a dispute between Cortés and the crown about the number of tributaries of the [[Marquesado del Valle de Oaxaca]]. These Indigenous censuses make it possible to establish an early colonial-era base-line for household structure, land holding, tribute obligations, and rates of baptism and Church marriage.<ref>Eike Hinz, Claudine Hartau, and Marie Luise Heimann-Koenen, eds.''Azteckischer Zensus, Zur indianischen Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft im Marquesado um 1540: Aus dem "Libro de Tributos"'' (Col.

The conditions on the sugar plantations of Morelos made [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla|Father Miguel Hidalgo]]'s call to take up arms well received by the indigenous and mestizo populations of the state. The first rebellions broke out in 1811, with some early successes. An early insurgent leader in the state was Francisco Ayala.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://casaculturafranciscofrancosalazar.blogspot.com/2015/12/biografia-de-don-francisco-ayala-por.html |title=Casa de Cultura Coronel Francisco Franco Salazar: Biografía de Don Francisco Ayala por Alejandro Villaseñor |website=casaculturafranciscofrancosalazar.blogspot.com |date=4 December 2015 |access-date=Dec 29, 2018 |archive-date=30 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181230081351/http://casaculturafranciscofrancosalazar.blogspot.com/2015/12/biografia-de-don-francisco-ayala-por.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Insurgents from the state managed to push as far as [[Chalco de Díaz Covarrubias|Chalco]] in what is now Mexico State when royalist forces pushed them back in 1812.<ref name=gobhistoria/> After Hidalgo was executed (July 30, 1811), [[José María Morelos y Pavon]] took over the insurgent effort, joined by [[Mariano Matamoros]] of [[Jantetelco]].<ref name=enchistoria/>

By 1812, insurgents had control of the city of [[Cuautla, Morelos|Cuautla]], and royalist forces began to put it under siege. Morelos and his men held out for 58 days when reinforcement arrived, breaking the [[Siege of Cuautla]]. This was one of the early vital wins for the insurgent movement. Morelos would eventually be captured by royalists and executed in 1815, but the memory of this battle would lead to the future state being named after him.<ref name=enchistoria/><ref name=schmal/>

In the post-war period, the sugar industry of Morelos made this region one of the richest parts of the Mexican Republic. Much of this sugar made its way to European markets. As a result, the city of Cuernavaca, serving as an important trade center for exports, became a well-established outpost along the Camino Real (Royal Road) to Acapulco. But the sugar cane estates were worlds unto themselves: great luxury for the (often absentee) owners and misery, debt, and poverty for the workers.<ref name=houstoncul>[http://www.houstonculture.org/mexico/morelos.html Morelos] houstonculture.org {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210312004536/http://www.houstonculture.org/mexico/morelos.html |date=2021-03-12 }} Retrieved Dec 29, 2018</ref>

After winning independence, what is now the state of Morelos was the district of Cuernavaca as part of the very large State of Mexico, created in 1824. The entity would change status between state and department depending on whether liberal or conservative factions were in charge. Under the Constitution of 1857, the State of Mexico and all other states would keep their federal status permanently.<ref name=gobhistoria/>

[[Cuernavaca]] gained the title of city in 1834.<ref name=enchistoria/> During the [[Mexican–American War]], this city was taken by the Americans under [[George Cadwalader|General Cadwalader]].<ref name=gobhistoria/>

The next conflict was the uprising against President [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] under the [[Plan of Ayutla]] in 1854. Armed rebellion broke out in Cuautla, and Santa Anna responded by burning entire villages. However, the rebellion dislodged Santa Anna, naming [[Juan Álvarez]] as president. Alvarez moved the Mexican capital to Cuernavaca. A new constitutional convention was called and when the [[1857 Constitution]] was proclaimed, Alvarez retired and the capital moved back to Mexico City.<ref name=gobhistoria/><ref>Secretaria, pp. 132–133</ref>

The new constitution did not stop fighting among conservative and liberal factions in Mexico, which escalated again into the [[Reform War]] from 1858 to 1861.<ref>Secretaria, pp. 133–136</ref> While Cuautla was a liberal bastion, Cuernavaca was a stronghold for the conservatives; roamed by bandits who burned and destroyed the haciendas of Pantitlán and Xochimancas, terrorizing villagers. [[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]] wrote a novel, set in Yautepec, about the war and the bandits, called ''El Zarco: Episodios de la Vida Mexicana en 1861–63''.<ref>Secretaria, pp. 136–138</ref> The war ended on January 11, 1861, when [[Benito Juárez]] took control of Mexico City.

The division between the liberal and conservative parts of the state remained through the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French Intervention in Mexico]].<ref name=gobhistoria/> When the French Army invaded Mexico, [[Francisco Leyva]] raised an army in Morelos to fight in the [[Battle of Puebla]] of May 5, 1862. Despite the heroic efforts on that day, the French eventually managed to gain control of the country and install [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian of Habsburg]] as emperor in 1864. Maximilian chose the ''Jardin Borda'' in Cuernavaca as his summer residence,<ref>Secretaria, pp. 138–139.</ref> and he built ''La Casa del Olindo'' in Acapantzingo, Cuernavaca supposedly for Margarita Leguizmo Sedano, his mistress known as "La India Bonita."<ref name=guia45>Morelos Guía Turística, p. 85</ref> The French emperor improved the roads from Mexico City to Cuernavaca; telegraph service between the two began in 1866.<ref name=enchistoria/> However, resistance to French rule was well underway. On January 1, 1867, Republican troops under the leadership of ''Francisco Leyva, Ignacio Figueroa'', and ''Ignacio Manuel Altamirano'' began an eight-day siege of Cuernavaca. France, under [[Napoleon III]], withdrew its troops soon after that, and Maximilian was defeated by Republican forces and executed.<ref>Secretaria, pp. 139–140</ref>

After the French were expelled by forces under [[Benito Juárez]], there were efforts to divide the State of Mexico. This resulted in the approval of the state of Morelos on September 21, 1868, by the federal Congress, followed by the official admittance of Morelos as the country's 27th state on April 17, 1869. The territory of the state was the Third Military District of the State of Mexico as defined by the Juárez government; the name "Morelos" and the capital "Cuernavaca" were selected by the state's first legislature. The first state constitution was finalized in 1870, and [[Francisco Leyva Arciniegas]] became the first Constitutional [[Governor of Morelos]].	There were boundary disputes between the new state with Mexico State and the Federal District, but these were resolved by the 1890s.<ref name=gobhistoria/>

A telegraph line from Mexico City to Cuernavaca had been laid between 1867 and 1869; in 1870 it was extended to [[Iguala]], [[Chilpancingo]], and Tixla. Another line, between Cuernavaca and Cuautla, was laid in 1875. Attempts were made to improve education, but limited funds made that virtually impossible.<ref name="Educación Publica pp. 141-144">Secretaria, pp. 141–144</ref> Other infrastructure projects in the late 19th century included the [[Toluca]]-Cuernavaca highway, and a rail line between Mexico City and Cuautla. 200 people died when a train plunged into the [[San Antonio River]] at the ''Puente de Escontzin'' (Escontzin Bridge) near Cuautla in what became known as the [[Morelos railway accident]] on June 23, 1881.<ref name=cronologia>{{cite web|url=http://morelos.gob.mx/?q=cronologia_morelos|title=Cronología de los hechos en Morelos|publisher=Gobierno de Morelos 2018-2024|access-date=Feb 26, 2019|language=es|trans-title=Chronology of facts in Morelos|archive-date=30 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181230233326/http://morelos.gob.mx/?q=cronologia_morelos|url-status=live}}</ref> Rail lines would continue to be built into the 20th century, connecting the state further with Mexico City and the Pacific Ocean.<ref name=gobhistoria/> On May 11, 1874, the capital was moved to Cuautla; it was returned to Cuernavaca on January 1, 1876.<ref name=enchistoria/><ref name="Educación Publica pp. 141-144"/>

During the long presidency of [[Porfirio Diaz]] (1877–1911), the economy of Morelos continued to be dominated by the large sugar plantations. The sugar cane estates were modernized and began to use steam-driven mills and centrifugal extractors. These changes created a great new demand for the water and land resources needed to grow sugar cane. As a result, the haciendas expanded steadily, but only at the expense of the peasants, who were unfairly deprived of their land by the hacienda owners.<ref name=houstoncul/> Between 1884 and 1905, eighteen towns in Morelos disappeared as lands were taken by the haciendas.<ref>Secretaria, pp. 152–158</ref>

The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cuernavaca]] was established in 1894 with [[Fortino Hipólito Vera]] as the first bishop (1894–1898).<ref name=gobhistoria/> He was followed by [[Francisco Plancarte y Navarrete]] (1898–1911).<ref name="catholic">{{citation|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dcuer.html|title=Diocese of Cuernavaca|website=Catholic Hierarchy.org|access-date=Dec 29, 2018|archive-date=5 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181005152015/http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dcuer.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Zapata felt betrayed by [[Francisco Madero]], and following Madero's election as president on November 6, 1911, Zapata and his followers called for agrarian reform in the [[Plan de Ayala]]. Contrary to popular belief, the state's motto, ''Tierra y Libertad'' (Land and Liberty) did not originate with Zapata or the Plan de Ayala; it was first used by [[Ricardo Flores Magón]] in the magazine ''Regeneración'' on October 1, 1910.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lavozdelnorte.com.mx/2013/02/10/lemas-zapatistas-en-los-escudos-del-estado-de-morelos/ |title=Lemas Zapatistas en los Escudos del Estado de Morelos |website=www.lavozdelnorte.com.mx |access-date=Dec 29, 2018 |archive-date=30 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181230081527/http://www.lavozdelnorte.com.mx/2013/02/10/lemas-zapatistas-en-los-escudos-del-estado-de-morelos/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Madero was assassinated; Victoriano Huerta took over the government, but he was soon put on the run. In May 1914, Zapata, with a force of 3,600 men, took control of the southern Jojutla district. By this time, Cuernavaca was the only important town in Morelos that the Federal forces held onto.<ref name="auto3"/> It took 72 days to take Cuernavaca,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/934239.hotel-que-sirvio-de-cuartel-a-zapata-hoy-es-plaza-comercial.html |title=Hotel que sirvió de cuartel a Zapata hoy es plaza comercial |website=www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx |date=18 November 2013 |access-date=Dec 29, 2018 |archive-date=30 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181230080708/https://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/934239.hotel-que-sirvio-de-cuartel-a-zapata-hoy-es-plaza-comercial.html |url-status=live }}</ref> after which he marched on Milpa Alta (Mexico City).

====Zapata and Carranza====
{{anchor|Revolution and 20th century}}
Huerta was defeated, and 1915 was fairly peaceful in Morelos. However, by December 1915, Zapata was forced to fight a new enemy—[[Venustiano Carranza]]. Carranza embarked upon an offensive that retook significant parts of the state of Morelos. By the spring of 1916, Zapata was forced to abandon several of his strongholds. The biggest loss came on May 2, 1916, when Zapata lost Cuernavaca to enemy forces, which now numbered some 30,000 troops. As Zapata continued to lose ground, his forces were forced to return to the guerilla warfare that they had waged a few years earlier. They retook Cuernavaca in January, 1916,<ref name="auto3"/> but he generally lost ground to the ''Constitutionalists''. The Zapatistas imposed a heavy tax on haciendas; when the owners refused to pay, the rebels burned the cane fields such as those of Chinameca, Tenango, Treinta, Atilhuayan, Santa Iñes, and San Gabriel.<ref>Secretaria, pp. 179–180</ref> Then, on April 17, 1919, Zapata was betrayed and ambushed at [[Chinameca, Morelos|Chinameca]].<ref name=gobhistoria/> Zapata's remains are currently in Cuautla at the foot of a statue erected in his honor.<ref name=gobhistoria/>

When the Constitutionalists split and Minister of War [[Álvaro Obregón]] was forced to flee, he and Zapata's Chief of Staff and successor [[Gildardo Magaña]] joined forces and defeated Carranza. Obregón's government duly reciprocated with legislating a land reform in Morelos according to the Plan de Ayala principles.<ref>John Womack: ''Zapata and the Mexican Revolution'', Vintage 1968</ref>

Since the Revolution, the state's history has centered on development and crime. There were several assaults along the Mexico City-Cuernavaca highway in 1928 and again in 1934. There was a train robbery in 1928, and several major train accidents in the 1930s. The statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe in ''El Calvario'' (Cuernavaca) was destroyed by vandals in 1934. Striking police went of a crime wave in 1937. Five thousand rioters protested when the Cuernavaca police killed Jorge Garrigós in 1957. The municipal president of Jiutepec was assassinated on May 26, 1958. In 1960, three government officials in Cuernavaca were fired because of embezzlement.<ref name=cronologia_morelos>{{cite web |url=http://morelos.gob.mx/?q=cronologia_morelos |title=Cronologia Morelos |website=morelos.gob.mx |access-date=December 29, 2018 |archive-date=December 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181230233326/http://morelos.gob.mx/?q=cronologia_morelos |url-status=dead }}</ref>

From 1943 to 1944, and again from 1953 to 1958, [[Rubén Jaramillo]] led peasant revolts against the government. Despite promises and a guarantee of his safety from presidents [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]] in 1944 and [[Adolfo López Mateos]] in 1958, Jaramillo was gunned down in [[Xochicalco]] by federal police on May 23, 1962.<ref>{{cite web |language=es

As it has been since Aztec times, the state, especially Cuernavaca, has been a favorite retreat for those in Mexico City due to its warm year-round climate. That, plus pollution and the September 19, [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]], have spurred a major housing boom which continues to this day. Most of this boom is centered on the city of Cuernavaca but also Cuautla and other places.<ref name=jtaylor/><ref name=reprueban>{{cite news |title= Reprueban crecimiento de Morelos |author=Raquel Fierro |newspaper=Reforma |location= Mexico City |date=May 2, 2006 |page=14 |language=es |trans-title=They reject growth in Morelos}}</ref>

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the major crime problem was kidnapping for ransom. The kidnapping crime wave caused investment in the state to drop from a high of US$245&nbsp;million in 1999 to $102&nbsp;million in 2002, with the state lagging behind the country in job creation. The state broke the kidnapping rings in the early 2000s, mostly by arresting corrupt lawyers, police, and judges who were protecting kidnapping rings, includes one run by Daniel "Mocha Orejas" Arizmendi, who received his nickname by cutting off his victims' ears and sending them to family members. The busts brought the kidnapping rate to below national average.<ref name=rosestate>{{cite journal |author=John Moody |date=October 2003 |title= Saving the rose state |journal=Business Mexico |volume=13 |issue=10 |page=26 |location=Mexico City}}</ref> Governor Jorge Carrillo Olea (1994–1998) was forced to resign after being accused of covering for kidnappers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.milenio.com/estados/quien-es-jorge-carrillo-olea |title=¿Quién es Jorge Carrillo Olea? |website=www.milenio.com |date=4 January 2014 |access-date=Dec 21, 2018 |archive-date=2 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202174651/https://www.milenio.com/estados/quien-es-jorge-carrillo-olea |url-status=live }}</ref>

The kidnapping problems have been replaced with violence related to the drug trade, despite the fact that Morelos is far from the U.S. border.

The state is considered to be one of the most dangerous, despite its small size and population. Most crime is centered in Cuernavaca. Its crime rate surpasses that of Mexico City in terms of crimes per 1,000 people. It is over 50% higher than the national average. Although Cuernavaca has only 21% of the population, it suffers 45% of the crime committed in the state. There are a number of possible causes. Some blame the judicial system for being inept and there are strong links to the drug trafficking trade, en route to Mexico City.<ref name=ciudadcrimen>{{cite news |title= La Ciudad y el Crimen / El Estado de Morelos |author=Rafael Ruiz Harrell |newspaper=Reforma |location= Mexico City |date=July 18, 2005 |page=8 |language=es |trans-title=The City in Crime/The state of Morelos}}</ref>

It was the largest city of the Tlahuicas and originally called Cuauhnahuac, but the Spanish changed it to the current name which means "Cow Horn" in Spanish.

Morelos, most of which is between {{convert|1,000|and|3,300|m|ft|sp=us}} above sea level, has a very diverse topography: 42% is mountainous, 16% hilly land, and 42% flat terrain.<ref name=schmal/> The highest altitudes are found near the state's border with Mexico City, and the lowest are found in the [[Huaxtla]] region.<ref name=mediofisico/> The state straddles two main geographic formations, the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]] in the north and east and the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]], which stretches south and west from Cuernavaca and Jiutepec.<ref name=secturclima>{{cite web |url=http://www.morelostravel.com/sobremorelos.php |title=El Clima en Morelos |publisher=Secretaria del Turismo de Morelos |location=Morelos |language=es |trans-title=The weather in Morelos |access-date=September 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926104328/http://www.morelostravel.com/sobremorelos.php |archive-date=September 26, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The majestic mountain peaks of the [[Ajusco|Sierra Ajusco]] in the north of the state divide Morelos from the neighboring Valley of Mexico.<ref name=schmal/>

The state is in the highest part of the [[Balsas River]] basin, which ends in the north in the areas bounded by the Sierra Ajusco-Chichinautzin and the [[Popocatépetl]] volcano. From this point south, the state gradually slopes downward, interrupted by the Tlaltizapan and Yautepec mountains in the center of the state and the [[Sierra de Huautla]] in the south.<ref name=secturclima/> Most of the rivers and streams of the state, including the [[Cuautla River]], flow into the [[Amacuzac River]] on the border with the state of [[Guerrero]], which itself is a major tributary of the [[Balsas River]].<ref name=mediofisico/>

The climate and vegetation varies from alpine meadows in the highest elevations near Popocatepetl to lowland rainforest in the south. Roughly 70% of the state has a humid and relatively warm climate, especially in the highly populated areas of Cuernavaca, Tepotzlán, Oaxtepec and Yautepec. Average temperature is approximately {{convert|25|C}} year-round, with a rainy season from May until September.<ref name=jtaylor/><ref name=secturclima/>

The climates can be further subdivided: hot and semi-humid; semi-hot and semi-humid; temperate and semi-humid; semi-cold and semi-humid; and cold. The hot and semi-humid climate covers about 78% of the state's territory, with an average temperature of {{convert|22|C}}, with rains in the summer. This area presents mostly subtropical-rainforest-type vegetation. The semi-hot and semi-humid climate can be found in a strip in the north of the state and accounts for 13% of the territory. Average temperature varies between 18 and 22 degrees Celsius, with rains in the summer and a dry season in the winter. A temperate and semi-humid climate covers about 10% of the territory and is found in the north of the state around the municipalities of [[Huitzilac, Morelos|Huitzilac]], [[Tlanepantla, Morelos|Tlanepantla]], [[Totolapan]], [[Tetela del Volcán]] and parts of Cuernavaca, Tepoztlan, Ocuituco, Tlayacapan and [[Miacatlán]]. This area has an average temperature of between 10 and 15 degrees Celsius, with mixed forests of pine and [[Quercus ilex|holm oak]]. A semi-cold and semi-humid climate accounts for only 2% of the territory and found along the borders of the Federal District, Mexico State, and Puebla. This area has pine forests and some [[Alpine tundra|alpine meadows]]. The coldest climate is found in the upper parts of Popocatepetl that belong to the state. Average temperature here is less than 5 degrees Celsius with frequent freezes. Most of the vegetation is alpine meadow or moss.<ref name=mediofisico/>

The natural resources of the state have been taken advantage of for centuries and have suffered changes as a consequence, especially in landscapes, water sources, flora, and fauna. This change accelerates as the population grows.<ref name=mediofisico/> The state has one major national park, the [[Lagunas de Zempoala National Park|Lagunas de Zempoala]]. It is one of Mexico's largest national parks, located on the southern flank of the Sierra Madre mountains. The park had five mountain-fed lakes and abundant wildlife when the park was established in 1937. This park is being stressed due to [[illegal logging]], with subsequent [[soil erosion]] and water from its last dark blue lake to drainage. Much of this drainage is to provide water to Cuernavaca, whose population uses 785 liters of water per day per person, twice that of Mexico City. The park's area has shrunk from {{convert|55000|acre|km2|abbr=on}} to 12,500.<ref name=restorepark/>

Much of the state's ecological woes stem from the housing explosion, which is mostly centered in the capital of Cuernavaca, but it is a problem in places such as Cuautla as well. Groups such as the Frente de Pueblos en Defensa de la Tierra y el Agua and Guardianes de los Àrboles have criticized the government for allowing city areas to grow with insufficient planning and control. They also claim that it is hurting much of the state's ecosystem and water supply.<ref name=reprueban/>

Morelos has 39 [[Open-pit mining|open-pit mines]] covering an area of {{convert|15,025|ha|acres}}, mostly in Temixco, Miacatlan, Xocitepec, and Cuernavaca. Mines of this sort often affect the health of both miners and people who live in nearby communities; they threaten the air, water supply, and soil in addition to the flora and fauna of the community. The Canadian company [[AuRico Gold|Alamos Gold]] has a concession to mine the ''cerro del Jumil'' which threatens the subsoil of the [[Xochicalco]] archaeological site.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Paredes |first1=Susana |title=[Especial] Amenaza ambiental, 39 minas a cielo abierto en Morelos |url=https://www.elsoldecuernavaca.com.mx/local/especial-amenaza-ambiental-39-minas-a-cielo-abierto-en-morelos-3984802.html/amp |website=El Sol de Cuernavaca |access-date=June 6, 2020 |language=en |archive-date=4 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190804190416/https://www.elsoldecuernavaca.com.mx/local/especial-amenaza-ambiental-39-minas-a-cielo-abierto-en-morelos-3984802.html/amp |url-status=live }}</ref>

Mexico is located near the North American, Pacific, Cocos, Rivera, and Caribbean Tectonic Plates, making the country highly susceptible to earthquakes.

It is followed by the urban area of Cuautla-Yautepec-Ayala with just under 20%.<ref name=perfilsoc/>

The state has had a higher than average population increase since the mid-1990s at about 4%. In some areas, population growth has been very high at points, such as in Jiutepec (over 21%) and Emiliano Zapata (over 15%). Much of this growth has been in the main cities of Cuernavaca, Cuautla, Ayala and Yautepec. This growth has meant the loss of the state's ability to feed itself, with less than 40% of grains consumed grown inside Morelos. Population growth has also put a strain on infrastructure such as water, sewer, potable water, electricity, roads, and schools.<ref name=perfilsoc/>

The Catholic religion dominates, but there are significant minorities of evangelical Protestants and those of the Jewish faith.<ref name=perfilsoc/>

The indigenous population of the state is estimated at 8%, just under the national average of 10%.<ref name=perfilsoc/> However, only 2% of the population is counted as speaking an indigenous language compared to 7% nationally.<ref name=inegientidad/> The total counted in 2005 by INEGI was 24,757.<ref name=perfilsoc/>
Historically, various [[Nahua peoples]] have dominated the state. This population severely diminished during the colonial period and again during the Porfiriato (late 19th and early 20th centuries), when many indigenous peasants were sent to other parts of the country to work. Those considered to be ethnically indigenous are located in 33 municipalities with most concentrated in 15 of these. Many identify as Mixtec, [[Tlapanec people|Tlapaneco]] and Zapotec who have immigrated from Puebla, Guerrero, and Oaxaca. Most of those who identify as Nahua are native to the state. Many of the immigrant indigenous are migrant workers, traveling among fields of sugar cane, corn, tomatoes, and onions. Some return to their home states in the off-season and some remain permanently in Morelos.<ref name=perfilsoc/>

While indigenous languages have largely disappeared since the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]], many old customs and traditions continue to live on as part of many people's identity. Many ethnic Nahuas conserve much of their ancient knowledge, such as dances, music, agricultural practices, and rituals, although most are mixed with Catholic and moderns beliefs and practices. Since Mexico's census only counts the indigenous by language spoken and not by ethnicity, it is not possible to be sure of the precise number of Nahua in Morelos. Between 32 and 35 communities in the state have been identified as being "indigenous" based on prevailing customs and tradition. However, this does not take into account migrant workers or who have immigrated to the state from other parts of Mexico.<ref name=perfilsoc/> In 2020, 37,569 people were counted as speaking an indigenous language,<ref>{{cite web |title=México en cifras |url=https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/areasgeograficas/?ag=17 |website=inegi.org.mx |publisher=INEGI |access-date=February 23, 2021 |language=es |date=1 January 2016 |archive-date=31 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210531061001/https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/areasgeograficas/?ag=17 |url-status=live }}</ref> with the municipalities of Cuautla, Cuernavaca, Ayala, Puente de Ixtla, Temixco, and Tetela del Volcàn having the highest number of speakers.

===Governors of Morelos===
{{See also|Governor of Morelos}}

Morelos had seven governors between 1869 (when the state was formed) and 1911 (when the [[Mexican Revolution|Madero Revolution]] triumphed). [[Francisco Leyva Arciniegas]] was the first Constitutional governor (1869–1876).<ref name=gobernadores>{{cite web|url=http://morelos.gob.mx/?q=gobernadores|title=Gobernadores|website=morelos.gob.mx|language=es|access-date=1 September 2023|archive-date=6 June 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230606163625/https://morelos.gob.mx/?q=gobernadores|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Thirty-four men held the highest administrative position in Morelos between 1911 and 1930. Their titles included ''Constitutional Governor'', ''Substitute Governor'', ''Provisional Governor'', ''Temporary Governor'', ''Military Governor'', ''Political head of Territory'', and ''In charge of office''. General [[Genovevo de la O]], and [[José Parres|José G. Parres Guerrero]] are the best-known names. Octavio Paz Solórzano, father of the poet by the same name, served briefly in 1925.<ref name=gobernadores/>

Twenty men have served as governor during the Constitutional Period. [[Vicente Estrada Cajigal]] ([[PNR]], 1930–1934) was the first Constitutional governor after the [[Mexican Revolution|Revolution]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.launion.com.mx/component/k2/noticias/14367-el-general-l%C3%B3pez-de-nava.html|title=El General López de Nava|first=Javier Jaramillo|last=Frikas|website=www.launion.com.mx|date=6 June 2023|access-date=10 December 2018|archive-date=19 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119121247/https://www.launion.com.mx/component/k2/noticias/14367-el-general-l%C3%B3pez-de-nava.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The economy of Morelos is based on agriculture, tourism, and urbanization. Since the 1960s, the economy has been shifting from agriculture to industry and commerce. However, most of these shifts have occurred on a small scale and a number of municipalities are still almost completely reliant on agriculture. While the state provides just 1.6% of the country's GDP, its economy is strong enough to attract workers, especially farm workers from other areas of the country.<ref name=perfilsoc>{{cite web |url=http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/morelos/ |title=Perfil Sociodemográfico |year=2005 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Morelos |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Socio demographic profile |access-date=September 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718114447/http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/morelos/ |archive-date=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=actecon>{{cite web |url=http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/morelos/ |title=Actividad Económica |year=2005 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Morelos |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Economic Activity |access-date=September 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718114447/http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/morelos/ |archive-date=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> However, a large percentage of the state's population works six days a week, receiving wages of only 500 to 700 Mexican pesos ($46–$65USD), despite the fact that Morelos is one of the more expensive states to live in.<ref name=jtaylor/>

Economically, the state divides into seven districts. The Cuernavaca Region includes the municipalities of Cuernavaca, Temixco, Emiliano Zapata, Jiutepec, and Xochitepec. The North Region includes the municipalities of Huitzilac, Tepoztlán, Tlalnepantla, and Totolapan. The Cuautla Region includes the municipalities of Atlatlahucan, Ayala, Cuautla, Tlayacapan, Yautepec de Zaragoza, and Yecapixtla. The Northeast Region includes Ocuituco, Temoac, Tetela del Volcán, and Zacualpan de Amilpas. The Southeast Region includes Axochiapan, Jantetelco, Jonacatepec and Tepalcingo. The South Region includes Amacuzac, Jojutla, Puente de Ixtla, Tlaltizapán, Tlaquiltenango, and Zacatepec de Hidalgo; and the Western Region includes Coatlán del Río, Mazatepec, Miacatlán and Tetecala.<ref name=regionalizacion>{{cite web |url=http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/morelos/ |title=Regionalización |year=2005 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Morelos |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Regions |access-date=September 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718114447/http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/morelos/ |archive-date=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2003, Morelos was one of the first states to take advantage of a new law allowing states to sell bonds.<ref name=rosestate/> In 2002, the state sold $24&nbsp;million USD worth of bonds on the Mexican stock market in order to finance highways, schools, waterworks and other infrastructure projects. The bond sales also allowed the state to access lower-interest long-term financing.<ref name=fiscaltools>{{cite news |title= New Fiscal Tools Help Mexico Gain Economic Sophistication |author=Brendan M. Case |newspaper=Knight Ridder Tribune Business News |location= Washington |date=April 11, 2002 |page=1}}</ref>

Due to its location near Mexico City, the state has one of the lower rates of economic marginalization, ranking 20th of 33 units in economic marginalization, based on housing and education. The most urbanized areas of the state are the strongest economically, with the least urbanized being the poorest. Two of the factors in the development of the state's economy since the 1960s are the opening of the Mexico City-[[Acapulco]] highway through the state in 1952 and the creation of the [[Civac]] (Ciudad Industrial Valle de Cuernavaca) industrial complex in 1965. This concentrated the population growth into the northern part of the state. Eleven of the state's 36 municipalities are considered to have a serious degree of marginalization: Tlalnepantla, Totolapan, Tlayacapan, Tetela del Volcán, Ocuituco, Zaculapan, Temoac, Tepalcingo, Amacuzac, Coatlán del Río, Miacatlán and some parts of Puente de Ixtla.<ref name=perfilsoc/>

Since the 1980s, the agricultural sector of the economy has been steadily shrinking but it remains an important part of the state's economy, as there are still a significant number of communities that rely on it.<ref name=perfilsoc/> Just under 20% of the working population of the state is involved in farming, ranching, fish farming or forestry.<ref name=actecon/> Land available for human exploitation outside of populated areas is divided between agriculture/grazing (45%) and forestry (55%).<ref name=mediofisico/> Agricultural and forestry lands are further subdivided by climate and the type of forest (conifer vs. rainforest). Roughly 70% of the state has a subtropical climate, providing ideal conditions for agriculture, in particular sugar cane, and most farming is done in the warmer areas.<ref name=schmal/><ref name=mediofisico/> Sugar cane has been an important crop since colonial times and still is important today, although the percentage of land dedicated to it has decreased since the 1960s. Another important crop is rice.<ref name=perfilsoc/> The production of rice in the state has fallen drastically, from a height of 100,000 tons annually to only 21,000 tons due to the reduction in cultivation areas and the high costs of production. The state still ranks sixth in its production. However, despite price and market protections, foreign rice is competing with rice produced in the state.<ref name=arrozcae>{{cite news |title= Produccion de arroz cae a 21 mil toneladas anuales en zona de Morelos |author=Carlos Velasco |newspaper=NoticiasFinancieras |location= Miami |date=December 20, 2004 |page=1 |language=es |trans-title=Rice production falls to 21,000 tones annually in the Morelos area}}</ref> Sorghum has replaced lost yields of sugar cane and rice to a certain extent, which has been encouraged by the government.<ref name=perfilsoc/> One way the state tries to sell its more expensive products such as rice has been the registration of a trademark called''Tradición Agrícola de Morelos'' (Morelos Agricultural Tradition) to identify products produced in the state on store shelves.<ref name=arrozcae/>

Another important cash and export crop is fresh flowers and ornamental plants. In 2003, this sector accounted for 27&nbsp;million dollars of income to the state, up from 20&nbsp;million in 2000.<ref name=actecon/><ref name=arrozcae/> Morelos is Mexico's major producers of roses, producing 54,552 dozens in 2002.<ref name=rosestate/> Morelos claims to be the native location of the [[poinsettia]], called ''noche buena'' in Spanish.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.culturamas.es/blog/2017/12/06/el-origen-azteca-de-la-flor-de-nochebuena-y-su-historia/ |title=El Origen azteca de la flor de Nochebuena y su historia |website=www.culturamas.es |date=6 December 2017 |access-date=Jan 1, 2019 |archive-date=2 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102051047/https://www.culturamas.es/blog/2017/12/06/el-origen-azteca-de-la-flor-de-nochebuena-y-su-historia/ |url-status=live }}</ref> It is native to Mexico, but there has been a "diplomatic patent" on the plant since the early 19th century when the first US ambassador to Mexico, [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]], registered it.

Along with corn and beans are grown for subsistence, other fruits and vegetables are widely grown.

The state, especially around the capital of Cuernavaca, has experienced a housing boom since the late 1990s. More than 10,000 houses were built from 2000 to 2008 and another 50,000 are planned through 2013. The state's office of urban development states that this is far above what is needed to house the state's population. Instead, it reflects demand from Mexico City for a weekend and getaway homes.

It covers an area of 30 hectares and is one of the largest water parks in Latin America. ''Ex-Hacienda de Temixco'' is located 10 minutes south of Cuernavaca in the town of [[Temixco]]. This park is built on the site of a 16th-century sugar-cane plantation which was appropriated during the Mexican Revolution.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Water-skiing is popular at [[Lake Tequesquitengo]] and ''Acuaski''. Scuba and snorkeling are popular at ''Las Estacas'' and at Lake Tequesquitengo. White-water rafting is available on the [[Amacuzac River]].{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Hiking is done primarily along the ''[[Corredor Biológico Ajusco Chichinautzin]]'' in the mountainous regions of Huitzilac, Tepoztlan, and Tlayacapan. Many waterparks allow camping, and both the [[YMCA]] and the [[Asociación de Scouts de México, Asociación Civil|Scouts of Mexico]] operate large campgrounds in Tepoztlan. Rock climbing and rappel are popular at the Scout camp in [[Meztitla Scout Camp School|Meztitla]] and elsewhere, such as [[Lagunas de Zempoala National Park]].

===Cuisine===
In Cuernavaca, at ''Las Mañanitas'', diners enjoy chicken in green ''mole'', [[tortilla soup]] and trout almandine, among other selections, surrounded by tropical plants and birds. At ''Reposado'', nouvelle Mexican offerings include ''huitlacoche'' (corn smut) fondue, salmon in ''adobo'' and game hen in peanut ''mole''. In addition to the more famous restaurants, Cuernavaca has its share of mom-and-pop eateries, which feature a good variety of enchiladas with various fillings and sauces, and local specialties like rabbit in ''ancho chile adobo'' and chicken in peach sauce. The latter is a very characteristic dish of the region since it combines chicken with fruit, of which Morelos has seemingly endless varieties. The ''taco acorazado'', consisting of two large tortillas, rice, and beef or chicken, is the most typical food of Cuernavaca. ''Tacos al pastor'', which is marinated pork slowly cooked by a gas flame on a vertical rotisserie and served on small tortillas, is also popular in the area.<ref name="jimenez">{{cite book|author=Patricia Jimenez Pons|title=Viaje a Traves del Sabor de Morelos Magico|language=es|trans-title=A trip through the flavor of Magic Morelos|publisher=Instituto de Cultura de Morelos|date=2010|location=Mexico|isbn=978-607-7773-42-9|pages=19–31|series=Identidad}}</ref>

===Music, dance, and ''Carnaval''===
[[File:Chinelos tepoztecas.jpg|thumb|Chinelos]]
Most of the state's traditional music is associated with [[corridos]]. The ''corrido'' is sung and played in many parts of Mexico. Those performed in Morelos belong to the "sureño" (southern) type, which can be complicated but, unlike the northern version, is not meant for dancing. The lyrics of this type of corrido generally have eight syllables per line forming stanzas of five verses each. This type of corrido dates back before the Mexican Revolution, but the tradition has waned. One band noted for saving traditional melodies and songs is the ''Banda Tlayacapan'', based in [[Tlayacapan]] in the north of the state. This band was formed in 1870 and is the state's oldest band organization. In popular music, the best-known composer from the state is [[Arturo Márquez]], who was born in [[Samosa, Sonora]], but has lived in Cuernavaca for a long time.

One tradition that is identified with the state of Morelos is the Dance of the [[Chinelos]]. The dance is popular on many occasions but especially during [[Carnival|Carnaval]] (English: Carnival).<ref name=brinco>{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/el-brinco-del-chinelo-morelos.html |title=El brinco del chinelo (Morelos) |date=February 2000 |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=es |trans-title=The Chinelo Dance (Morelos) |access-date=September 9, 2010 |archive-date=17 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817201056/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/el-brinco-del-chinelo-morelos.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The origin of the dance or tradition is not known. One story dates the origin to 1870 when a group of youths decided to dress in old clothes, covering their faces in cloth to shout and jump around in the streets. Other stories place the origin in the colonial past, either as a syncretism between Spanish and indigenous dances, or as a protest or mockery of the indigenous' Spanish overlords. However, it has clearly been identified as originating in Tlayacapan and later spreading to various parts of Morelos, Puebla, and Mexico City.<ref name=pormorelos/><ref name=brinco/>

Today, the Chinelo is a symbol of the identity of the state. Although Chinelos are most frequently found in Tepoztlán, Chinelos groups exist in many communities such as Yautepec, Oacalco, Cualtlixco, Atlahuahuacàn, Oaxtepec, Jojutla, and Totolapan. They can also be found in certain parts of Puebla. The Chinelos dance in groups near each other. Each dancer has his or her own style that has been developed since childhood.<ref name=pormorelos/><ref name=brinco/>

Although not as well known as the ''Carnaval'' of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], a number of communities in the state hold Carnival celebrations in the days leading up to [[Ash Wednesday]]. These include Jiutepec, Tlaltizapán, Emiliano Zapata, Tepoztlán, Tlayacapan, Yautepec, and Xochitepec. What distinguishes carnivals in Morelos from others in Mexico is the participation of the Chinelos and bands with wind instruments.<ref name=carnavales>{{cite web |url=http://www.morelosturistico.com/espanol/pagina/z_362_Calendario_de_Carnavales_en_Morelos.php |title=Calendario de Carnavales en Morelos. |publisher=Secretary of Tourism of Morelos |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Calendar of Carnivals in Morelos |access-date=September 9, 2010 |archive-date=26 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126203847/http://morelosturistico.com/espanol/pagina/z_362_Calendario_de_Carnavales_en_Morelos.php |url-status=live }}</ref> In Tepotzlan on a Sunday before Ash Wednesday, the traditional [[tianguis]] market is cleared away from the main square and hundreds of multicolored stands move onto the streets in order to make way for Carnival. The street stands mostly specialize in items needed to enjoy the event. Chinelo dancers dominate the event, many in costumes which have been very expensive to assemble. Other events during Carnival there are processions, including the principal one in which there are representatives of all the communities of the municipality. The events last from Sunday to midnight Tuesday, signaling the beginning of Ash Wednesday and [[Lent]]. Each day, the Chinelos dance more energetically than the last.<ref name=brinco/>

===Art and literature===
[[File:RobertBradyMusCasaTorre.JPG|thumb|left|Exterior of the Robert Brady Museum in Cuernavaca, known for its collection of [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|handcrafts and folk art]]]]
Most of the state's art scene dates from the 20th century. After the [[Mexican Revolution]], and partly because of state's role in it, a number of muralists came to the state and painted works with social themes in places such as the [[Palacio de Cortés]] and the [[Museo de la Tallera Siqueiros]]. Cuernavaca has several art museums:
* [[The Robert Brady Museum]] of folk art, which is located in the ''Centro Historico'' (Historical Center) of the city, around the corner from the cathedral.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://universaldomainexchange.com/vivacue2/robert-brady-museum/|title=Robert Brady Museum – Viva Cuernavaca|accessdate=1 September 2023|archive-date=9 July 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230709072005/https://universaldomainexchange.com/vivacue2/robert-brady-museum/|url-status=live}}</ref> Brady was an heir of the Mayflower moving company in the U.S. and an art collector. 
* The ''Museo Morelense de Arte Contemporáneo [[Juan Soriano (artist)|Juan Soriano]]'' (MMAC) is a project by JSa Arquitectura led by the architect Javier Sánchez Corral. Its location links Amatitlán, an emblematic town of Cuernavaca whose origins date back 1500 years, to the Historic Center of Cuernavaca, enriching the urban experience. It is the largest exhibition space in the state of Morelos, distributed in two galleries for temporary exhibitions: Central Gallery and Cube, in addition to an Open Forum, a multidisciplinary space. The museum includes a library, a sculptural garden, and workshops for public programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mmacjuansoriano.org/en/museo/|title=MMAC — Museum|access-date=2018-12-01|archive-date=2020-08-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200814130730/https://mmacjuansoriano.org/en/museo/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Public art includes the mural on the library of ''Parque Alameda Solidaridad Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta'', in Cuernavaca. The mural depicts the history of the state. In addition, there is a large fountain that resembles a pre-Hispanic ball field. Also, at the entrance to the ''Fraccionamiento Lomas de Cuernavaca'' in the municipality of Temixco, just outside Cuernavaca, is the ''Glorieta de La Luna'' with Venetian mosaic by José García Narezo. Along the main street, ''Paseo de la Reforma'', there are numerous shapes covered with ceramic tiles in the Gaudí style, with diverse representations, including the stars, dragons, and signs of the Zodiac. These are popularly called ''Las Bolas'', (the balls), and are a favorite play area for children.<ref name="auto2">{{Cite web|url=http://asoclcuernavaca.com/hisotria/lomas-cuernavaca.html|title=Super Fraccionamiento Lomas de Cuernavaca|website=asoclcuernavaca.com|access-date=1 December 2018|archive-date=2 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181202024758/http://asoclcuernavaca.com/hisotria/lomas-cuernavaca.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In the 1960s, Rosell built the ''Fuente de las mariposas'', (Butterfly Fountain) at the entrance to Tequesquitengo.

Because of the state's mild climate and Cuernavaca's cultural tradition, many Mexican and foreign artists and writers have made the state home. [[Joy Laville]] is from Wight, England and resides in Cuernavaca. She is known for her landscapes which often include nude humans. Some of her works are ''Mujer viendo una casa'', ''Mujer en perfil'' and ''Mujer con flores''. Jorge Cázares Campos is a native of the state who is a self-taught painter, mostly of Mexican landscapes. Rafael Cauduro was born in Mexico City and his artwork has brought him fame not only in Morelos but internationally as well. Magali Lara is also originally from Mexico City and has had shows in various countries. Morelos native Carlos Campos Campus is known for his sculpture with pre-Hispanic influence.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}} John Spencer was an American artist and writer whose legacy includes the ''Casona Spencer'' across from the cathedral and the murals of the ''Church of the Three Kings'' in the Santa Maria neighborhood in the north part of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://casonaspencer.org/john-spencer/|title=John Spencer – La Casona Spencer|accessdate=1 September 2023|archive-date=22 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230922151815/https://casonaspencer.org/john-spencer/|url-status=live}}</ref>

As for the literary heritage of Morelos, the most important writer was [[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]], author of ''[[El Zarco]]'', the story of the leader of a group of bandits based in Yautepec during the [[Reform War]], 1857–1860. Another well-known writer is [[Malcolm Lowry]], an Englishman who wrote ''Bajo del Volcán'' in the first half of the 20th century. It is set in Cuernavaca and made the city internationally famous. Elena Garro is an important Mexican writer originally from Puebla, but who lived most of her life in Cuernavaca. She is known for works such as ''Los Recuerdos del Porvenir'', ''El Árbol'' and ''Andarse por las ramas''. Another Mexican transplant to Cuernavaca is Franciso Hinojosa, one of the best-known authors of children's literature in the country.<ref name=rincones1417>Gonzalez, pp. 14–17</ref>

====Pre-Hispanic====

The most important pre-Hispanic ruins are found at the [[Xochicalco]]. This is a fortified city that was built on top of a large hill, including a Temple of [[Quetzalcoatl]] as its center. There is an observatory, three ball courts, and a ''tezmacal'' (steam bath) as well as a large museum. Xochicalco displays significant influence from [[Teotihuacan]], the [[Maya civilization]], and [[Monte Albán]].{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

[[Teopanzolco]] is located in Cuernavaca. The twin temple and several smaller structures were built by ''Tlahuicas''. Recent excavations suggest it dates from 1200 CE and it may have served as a model for the ''Templo Mayor'' in Mexico City.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/world/quake-damage-reveals-older-structure-inside-mexico-pyramid|title=Earthquake rips open 13th century Mexican pyramid to reveal even older temple inside|newspaper=National Post|date=July 16, 2018|access-date=February 4, 2019|archive-date=30 January 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240130011436/https://nationalpost.com/news/world/quake-damage-reveals-older-structure-inside-mexico-pyramid|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-44806790|title=Mexico earthquake leads to discovery of ancient temple|work=BBC News|date=July 12, 2018|access-date=December 17, 2018|archive-date=18 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181218115229/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-44806790|url-status=live}}</ref>

Other important archaeological sites in Morelos are: ''Olintepec'', [[Ciudad Ayala|Ayala]]. 14 structures that date from 1500–1200 BCE; ''Las Pilas'', [[Jonacatepec]]. 4 pyramids and 2 plazas from 700–500 BCE located inside a water park; [[Tepozteco]], Tepoztlan. A small pyramid built at the top of a hill in about 1200 BCE and last modified in 1452; [[Yautepec de Zaragoza|Yautepec]]. From the ''periodo postclásico medio y tardío'', this was a center for 11,500 people; [[Chalcatzingo]], Jantetelco. Constructions and petroglyphs from 1500–200 BCE. There are clear influences of the [[Olmecs]] from [[Veracruz]] and [[Tabasco]], and [[Coatetelco archaeological site|Coatetelco]], Miacatlán. Pyramids, platforms, and a ball court that date from 200–1521 CE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sic.gob.mx/lista.php?table=zona_arqueologica&estado_id=17|publisher=gob.mx/cultura|title=Zonas arqueológicas en Morelos: 8|access-date=February 4, 2019|language=es|trans-title=8 Archeological Zones in Morelos|archive-date=7 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207020146/http://sic.gob.mx/lista.php?table=zona_arqueologica&estado_id=17|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Colonial era and early independence====

After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], major constructions here were Christian instead of the native pagan. In the first half of the 16th century, a series of fortress-like church and monastery complexes were built around the slopes of the [[Popocatepetl]] volcano from Cuernavaca to [[Tetela del Volcán]], and on into Puebla state, all related to early evangelization efforts. Today, these monasteries are no longer used as such, although most of the churches associated with them remain active, and are now a [[Monasteries on the slopes of Popocatépetl|World Heritage Site]].{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Non-ecclesiastical buildings from the colonial and independence periods were mostly confined to the capital of Cuernavaca and include the [[Palace of Cortés, Cuernavaca|Palace of Cortes]], the ''Jardin Borda'' (Borda Garden),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.travelbymexico.com/cuernavaca/atractivos/?nom=ecuejborda|title=ARQUITECTURA: Jardín Borda|publisher=Travel by Mexico: Cuernavaca|access-date=February 4, 2019|language=es|trans-title=Architecture: Borda Garden|archive-date=4 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804034848/https://www.travelbymexico.com/cuernavaca/atractivos/?nom=ecuejborda|url-status=live}}</ref> the Cine Morelos<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mexicoescultura.com/recinto/51439/cine-morelos.html|title=Cine Morelos|publisher=Mexico es Cultura|access-date=February 4, 2019|language=es|trans-title=Morelos Cinema|archive-date=30 January 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240130011319/https://www.mexicoescultura.com/recinto/51439/cine-morelos.html|url-status=live}}</ref> and the Ocampo Theater.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mexicoescultura.com/recinto/50583/en/ocampo-theater-cuernavaca.html|publisher=Mexico es Cultura|title=Ocampo Theater-Cuernavaca|access-date=February 4, 2019|archive-date=30 January 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240130011319/https://www.mexicoescultura.com/recinto/50583/en/ocampo-theater-cuernavaca.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The kiosk of the Jardin Juarez in Cuernavaca was designed by [[Gustave Eiffel]] in 1886.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://masdemorelos.masdemx.com/2018/03/mexico-morelos-arquitectura-sitios-arqueologicos-exconventos-haciendas-edificios-increibles/|title=7 sitios arquitectónicos fantásticos en Morelos que tienes que conocer|date=March 16, 2018|access-date=February 4, 2019|publisher=Mas de Morelos|language=es|trans-title=7 Fantastic Architectural sites in Morelos that you should know|archive-date=30 January 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240130011319/https://masdemorelos.masdemx.com/2018/03/mexico-morelos-arquitectura-sitios-arqueologicos-exconventos-haciendas-edificios-increibles/|url-status=live}}</ref>

====20th and 21st centuries====

One notable 20th-century structure was the Japanese-style house built by Woolworths heiress Barbara Hutton, in Jiutepec, just outside the city of Cuernavaca.<ref name=rincones1213>Gonzalez, pp. 12–13</ref> This is a hotel and restaurant today.

A modern Catholic church is the ''Capilla Abierta de San José'' in Lomas de Cuernavaca, Temixco. The church was designed by Spanish architect Félix Candela in the 1950s in the style known as ''Techos de Cascaron''. Set upon a hill, the open-air chapel offers an impressive view of the Valley of Cuernavaca.<ref name="auto2"/>

The ''Centro Cultural Pedro López Elías'' (Pedro Lopez Elias Cultural Center) in Tepoztlan opened in 2016. It is the first ecological library in Mexico, contains 50,000 books, and has 42,000 solar panels. The ''Centro Cultural Teopanzolco'' (Teopanzolco Cultural Center) next to the pyramids in Cuernavaca was designed by the Mexican architects Isaac Broid.

==Education==
[[File:Cuernavaca, Pestalozzi school.jpg|thumb|Pestalozzi School in Cuernavaca]]
The state, especially in the Cuernavaca area, is known as a center of education, second to Mexico City. The state has a high percentage of educated and well-traveled people, many of whom speak second languages such as English, French and German.<ref name=jtaylor/>

Modern education in the state began during the [[Reform War|Reform period]], with the Mexican government taking over educational responsibilities from the church. The government's role in education expanded after the [[Mexican Revolution]]. In Morelos, the government founded "Casas del Pueblo" (People's Houses) staffed with a teacher for the community to become a central figure. In 1936, the ''Escuela Regional Campesina'' (Farm Workers' Regional School) was established in Yautepec and a short time after that President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] founded the ''Escuela Normal Feminina de Palmira'' (Palmira Teachers College for Women) and the ''Instituto Federal de Capacitacion del Magisterio'' for those to earn or complete their teaching credentials.<ref name=perfilsoc/>

Until 1991, education was rigidly centralized and bureaucratic, causing difficulties in providing adequate education to many areas. In 1992, the ''Instituto de la Educación Básica'' (IEBM) (Basic Education Institute) was created to change this. This divided basic education into preschool, special education, primary and secondary.<ref name=perfilsoc/>

Today over 360,000 students are taught by over 13,000 teachers in 823 schools up to the ninth grade.<ref name=perfilsoc/> All municipalities are required by state law to provide preschool, and grade school education to their populations up to the ninth grade, as well as professional development for teachers.

Secondary schools are also divided into general and technical schools. The state has four teachers' colleges, two which produce primary school teachers and two which produce secondary school teachers.<ref name=perfilsoc/> The state education system provides education from preschool to high school, vocational-technical education, as well as higher education to the doctoral level.

The origins of the [[Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Morelos]] (UAEM) date back to the 19th century, when governor Francisco Leyva founded the ''Instituto Literario y Cientifico de Morelos'' in 1871.
