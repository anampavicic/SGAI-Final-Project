Lahore's origin dates back to antiquity.

It succeeded [[Multan]] as the primary cultural centre of Punjab in the [[History of Punjab#Medieval Punjab (c. 500 AD – 1526 AD)|late-medieval era]], reaching the height of its splendor under the [[Mughal Empire]] between the late 16th and early 18th centuries and also serving as its capital city between 1586 and 1598. During this period, it was one of the largest cities in the world.<ref name="Dyson">{{Cite book |last=Dyson |first=Tim |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TRtDwAAQBAJ&dq=lahore+population+in+1600&pg=PA63 |title=A Population History of India: From the First Modern People to the Present Day |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-882905-8 |language=en |access-date=16 March 2023 |archive-date=4 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230404025722/https://books.google.com/books?id=3TRtDwAAQBAJ&dq=lahore+population+in+1600&pg=PA63 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Nader Shah's invasion of India|The city was captured and looted]] by the forces of the Persian [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid]] ruler [[Nader Shah]] in 1739. Although Mughal authority was briefly re-established, it fell into a period of decline and nominal control with frequent raids and invasions by [[Indian campaign of Ahmad Shah Durrani|Afghans]] and [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]]. After the official end of Mughal rule and [[Afghan–Maratha War]] in Punjab, the city became heavily contested among the Afghans and the [[Sikh confederacy|local Punjabi states]] between [[Afghan-Sikh Wars|1748 and 1798]]. The Afghans were eventually driven out of Punjab as the city was captured by the [[Sukerchakia Misl]], based in [[Gujranwala]], under [[Ranjit Singh]] in July 1799 where he was crowned the ''[[Maharaja]] of Punjab'', thus Lahore became the capital of the [[Sikh Empire]] in the early 19th century, regaining some of its lost grandeur.{{sfnp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}}

{{Main|Etymology of Lahore|}}

=== Origins ===
{{Main|Origins of Lahore}}

No definitive record of Lahore's early history exists, and its ambiguous historical background has given rise to various theories about its establishment and history. Hindu legend states that Keneksen, the founder of the [[Suryavansha|Solar dynasty]], migrated out from the city.{{sfnp|Neville|2006|p=xii}}

[[Alexander the Great]]'s historians make no mention of any city near Lahore's location during his invasion in 326 BCE, suggesting the city had not been founded by that point or was not noteworthy.{{sfnp|Latif|1892|p=352}} [[Ptolemy]] mentions in his ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' a city called ''Labokla'' situated near the [[Chenab]] and [[Ravi river]]s which may have been in reference to ancient Lahore, or an abandoned predecessor of the city.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Charles Umpherston Aitchison|title=Lord Lawrence and the Reconstruction of India Under the British Rule |year=2002 |publisher=Genesis Publishing |isbn=9788177551730|page=54}}</ref> Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] gave a vivid description of a large and prosperous unnamed city that may have been Lahore when he visited the region in 630 CE during his tour of India.<ref name=bosworth/> Xuanzang described the city, then under [[Taank Kingdom|Taank]] rule, as a great [[Brahmin]] city.

The first document that mentions Lahore by name is the ''[[Hudud al-'Alam]]'' ("The Regions of the World"), written in 982 CE,<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.kroraina.com/hudud/ |title=Hudud al-'Alam, The Regions of the World: A Persian Geography, 372 A.H. – 982 A.D. |translator=V.

Lahore, previously a town, first emerged as a notable city in 11th century during the era of [[Sufism|Sufi]] saint [[Ali Hujwiri|Ali al-Hajvery]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Amjad |first=Yaḥyá |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P60yAAAAIAAJ&q=tarikh+i+pakistan+yahya |title=Tārīḵẖ-i Pākistān: qadīm daur : zamānah-yi mā qabl az tārīḵẖ : Pākistān kī sarzamīn par āj se paune do kaṛoṛ sāl pahle... |date=1989 |publisher=Sang-i Mīl Pablīkeshanz |language=ur}}</ref> Few other references to Lahore remain from before its capture by the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid]] Sultan [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Mahmud]] in the 11th century.

Sultan Mahmud conquered Lahore between 1020 and 1027, making it part of Ghaznavid Empire.<ref name=bosworth/> He appointed [[Malik Ayaz]] as its governor in 1021. In 1034, the city was captured by Nialtigin, the rebellious governor of [[Multan]].

With the support of Sultan [[Ibrahim of Ghazna|Ibrahim]], Malik Ayaz rebuilt and repopulated the city, which had been devastated after the Ghaznavid invasion.

Following the [[Siege of Lahore (1186)|Siege of Lahore]] in 1186, the [[Ghurid]] ruler [[Muhammad of Ghor|Muhammad]] captured the city and imprisoned the last Ghaznavid ruler Khusrau Malik,<ref name=bosworth/> thus ending Ghaznavid rule over Lahore.

By the time of the rule of the Mughal empire's greatest emperors, a majority of Lahore's residents did not live within the walled city itself but instead lived in suburbs that had spread outside the city's walls.{{sfnp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}} Only 9 of the 36 urban quarters around Lahore, known as ''guzars'', were located within the city walls during the [[Akbar]] period.{{sfnp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}} During this period, Lahore was closely tied to smaller market towns known as ''qasbahs'', such as [[Kasur]] and [[Eminabad]], as well as [[Amritsar]], and [[Batala]] in modern-day India, which in turn, linked to supply chains in villages surrounding each ''qasbah''.{{sfnp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}}

====Akbar====
Beginning in 1584, Lahore became the Mughal capital when Akbar began re-fortifying the city's ruined citadel, laying the foundations for the revival of the [[Lahore Fort]].{{sfnp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}} Akbar made Lahore one of his original twelve ''[[subah]]'' provinces,{{sfnp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}} and in 1585–86, relegated governorship of the city and ''subah'' to [[Bhagwant Das]], brother of [[Mariam-uz-Zamani]], who was commonly known as "Jodhabhai".<ref name="Chandra">{{cite book|last1=Chandra|first1=Satish|title=Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals Part – II|date=2005|publisher=Har-Anand Publications|isbn=8124110662|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Rm9MC4DDrcC&pg=PA28|access-date=27 December 2017}}</ref>

Akbar also rebuilt the city's walls and extended their perimeter east of the Shah Alami bazaar to encompass the sparsely populated area of Rarra Maidan.{{sfnp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}} The Akbari Mandi [[grain trade|grain market]] was set up during this era, which continues to function to the present-day.{{sfnp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}} Akbar also established the [[Dharampura]] neighbourhood in the early 1580s, which survives today.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Latif|first1=Syad Muhammad|title=Agra historical and descriptive with an account of Akbar and his court and of the modern city of Agra |date=2003 |publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=8120617096 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9hZuAAAAMAAJ&q=akbar+dharmpura|access-date=27 December 2017}}</ref> The earliest of Lahore's many [[haveli]]s date from the Akbari era.{{sfnp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}}

Lahore's Mughal monuments were built under the reign of Akbar and several subsequent emperors.{{sfnp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}} Lahore reached its cultural zenith during this period, with dozens of mosques, tombs, shrines, and urban infrastructure developed in the city.

====Jahangir====
During the reign of Emperor [[Jahangir]] in the early 17th century, Lahore's bazaars were noted to be vibrant, frequented by foreigners, and stocked with a wide array of goods.{{sfnp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}} In 1606, Jehangir's rebel son [[Khusrau Mirza]] laid siege to Lahore after obtaining the blessings of the Sikh [[Guru Arjan Dev]].<ref name="Holt">{{cite book|last1=Holt|first1=P.

====Shah Jahan====
Jahangir's son, [[Shah Jahan]] (reigned 1628–1658), was born in Lahore in 1592.

Shah Jahan's son, [[Aurangzeb]], last of the great Mughal Emperors, further contributed to the development of Lahore.

Civil wars regarding succession to the Mughal throne following Aurangzeb's death in 1707 led to weakening control over Lahore from Delhi, and a prolonged period of decline in Lahore.{{sfnp|Latif|1892|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}} Mughal preoccupation with the [[Marathas]] in the [[Deccan Plateau]] eventually resulted in Lahore being governed by a series of governors who pledged nominal allegiance to the ever-weaker Mughal emperors in Delhi.{{sfnp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}}

It should not surprise us that the main focus of imperial attention in Punjab was its fertile countryside rather than cities like Lahore."</ref> The British instead laid out their capital city in an area south of the Walled City that would first come to be known as "Donald's Town" before being renamed "Civil Station".{{sfnp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}}

Under early British rule, formerly prominent Mughal-era monuments that were scattered throughout Civil Station were also re-purposed and sometimes desecrated – including the [[Tomb of Anarkali]], which the British had initially converted to clerical offices before re-purposing it as an [[Anglican]] church in 1851.<ref>{{harvp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}}. "What is more striking than the fact that Punjab's new rulers (cost-effectively) appropriated the symbolically charged buildings of their predecessors is how long some of those appropriations lasted. The conversion of the Mughal-era tomb of Sharif un-Nissa, a noblewoman during Shah Jahan's reign, popularly known as Anarkali, was one such case (Figure 1.2). This Muslim tomb was first used as offices and residences for the clerical staff of Punjab's governing board. In 1851, however, the tomb was converted into the Anglican church."</ref> The 17th-century [[Dai Anga Mosque]] was converted into railway administration offices during this time, the tomb of Nawab Bahadur Khan was converted into a storehouse, and the tomb of Mir Mannu was used as a wine shop.<ref>{{harvp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}}.

Nearby was the tomb of Nawab Bahadur Khan, a highly placed member of Akbar's court, which the railway used as a storehouse. That same tomb had been acquired earlier by the railway from the army, who had used it as a theater for entertaining officers. The railway provided another nearby tomb free of charge to the Church Missionary Society, who used it for Sunday services. The tomb of Mir Mannu, an eighteenth-century Mughal viceroy of Punjab who had brutally persecuted the Sikhs while he was in power, escaped demolition by the railway but was converted nevertheless into a private wine merchant's shop."</ref> The British also used older structures to house municipal offices, such as the Civil Secretariat, Public Works Department, and Accountant General's Office.<ref>{{harvp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}}. "with an abundance of abandoned large structures scattered throughout the civil station on nazul (state administered) property, the colonial government often chose to house major institutions in converted buildings rather than to build anew. These institutions included the Civil Secretariat, which, as we have seen, was located in Ventura's former house; the Public Works from Ranjit Singh's period; and the Accountant General's office, headquartered in a converted seventeenth century mosque near the tomb of Shah Chiragh, just off Mall Road."</ref>

The British built the [[Lahore Junction railway station|Lahore Railway Station]] just outside the Walled City shortly after the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Sepoy Mutiny of 1857]]; the station was therefore styled as a medieval castle to ward off any potential future uprisings, with thick walls, turrets, and holes to direct gun and cannon fire for the defence of the structure.<ref>{{harvp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}}. "The Lahore station, built during a time when securing British civilians and troops against a future "native" uprising was foremost in the government's mind, fortified medieval castle, complete with turrets and crenellated towers, battered flanking walls, and loopholes for directing rifle and cannon fire along the main avenues of approach from the city."</ref> Lahore's most prominent government institutions and commercial enterprises came to be concentrated in Civil Station in a half-mile wide area flanking [[The Mall, Lahore|The Mall]], where unlike in Lahore's military zone, the British and locals were allowed to mix.<ref name="Mall Road">{{harvp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}}. "We should remember that outside of colonial military cantonments, where rules encouraging racial separation were partially formalized in the residential districts of India's colonial cities. Wherever government institutions, commercial enterprises, and places of public congregation were concentrated, mixing among races and social classes was both legally accommodated and necessary. In Lahore these kinds of activities were concentrated in a half-mile-wide zone stretching along Mall Road from the Civil Secretariat, near Anarkali's tomb, at one end to the botanical gardens at the other."</ref> The Mall continues to serve as the epicentre of Lahore's civil administration, as well as one of its most fashionable commercial areas. The British also laid the spacious [[Lahore Cantonment]] to the southeast of the Walled City at the former village of Mian Mir, where unlike around The Mall, laws did exist against the mixing of different races.

==== Controversy about the city's Pashtun population ====
Some [[Pashtun nationalism|Pashtun nationalist]] parties argue that the [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] population of Lahore in the 2017 census has been underestimated, with Ameer Bahadur Khan, provincial general secretary of [[Awami National Party]], putting their numbers at 1.5 million, while Gul Muhammad Regwal, a member of [[Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party|Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party]], claiming more than 1 million including 300,000 in the [[Walled City of Lahore|Walled City]] alone, most of these having moved over the last 20 years, including due to military operations, but remaining uncounted as they're not considered permanent residents of Lahore.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ullah |first=Kaleem |date=27 September 2021 |title=Pakhtuns of Lahore: 'We have been deliberately undercounted in the census.' |url=https://loksujag.com/story/Pashtun-population-in-Pakistan-eng |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240817190152/https://loksujag.com/story/Pashtun-population-in-Pakistan-eng |archive-date=17 August 2024 |website=Lok Sujag}}</ref>

== Cityscape ==
=== Old City ===
[[File:Beauty of Pakistan (lahore).jpg|thumb|left|Cityscape of Lahore]]
Lahore's modern cityscape consists of the historic [[Walled City of Lahore]] in the northern part of the city, which contains several [[World Heritage Site]]s and national heritage sites. Lahore's urban planning was not based on geometric design but was instead built piecemeal, with small cul-de-sacs, as ''katrahs'' and ''galis'' developed in the context of neighbouring buildings.{{sfnp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}} Though certain neighbourhoods were named for particular religious or ethnic communities, the neighbourhoods themselves typically were diverse and were not dominated by the namesake group.{{sfnp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}}

[[File:Wazir Khan Mosque - Aerial View.jpg|thumb|right|The area around the [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] exemplifies the [[Walled City of Lahore|Walled City]]'s urban form]]
Lahore's urban typology is similar to other ancient cities in South Asia, such as [[Peshawar]], [[Multan]] and [[Delhi]] – all of which were founded near a major river, and included an old walled city and royal citadel.

By the end of the Sikh rule, most of Lahore's massive [[haveli]] compounds had been occupied by settlers. New neighbourhoods occasionally grew up entirely within the confines of an old Mughal haveli, such as the Mohallah Pathan Wali, which grew within the ruins of a haveli of the same name, built by Mian Khan.{{sfnp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}} By 1831, all Mughal Havelis in the Walled City had been encroached upon by the surrounding neighbourhood,{{sfnp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}} leading to the modern-day absence of any Mughal Havelis in Lahore.

A total of thirteen gates once surrounded the historic walled city. Some of the remaining gates include the Raushnai Gate, Masti Gate, Yakki Gate, Kashmiri Gate, Khizri Gate, Shah Burj Gate, Akbari Gate, and Lahori Gate. Southeast of the walled city is the spacious British-era [[Lahore Cantonment]].

[[File:Grand Jamia Masjid Bahria Town Lahore Pakistan cropped.jpg|thumb|Built in 2012, [[Grand Jamia Mosque, Lahore|Grand Jamia Mosque]] in southern Lahore is a blend of [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]] and modern architecture.]]

Lahore is home to numerous monuments from the [[Mughal Dynasty]], [[Sikh Empire]], and the [[British Raj|British Indian Raj]]. The architectural style of the [[Walled City of Lahore]] has traditionally been influenced by Mughal and Sikh styles.<ref>"[[Architecture of Lahore]]." Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia. Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. Web. 19 August 2016.</ref>

====Sikh period====
By the arrival of the Sikh Empire at the end of the 18th century, Lahore had decayed from its former glory as the Mughal capital. Rebuilding efforts under Ranjit Singh and his successors were influenced by Mughal practices, and Lahore was known as the 'City of Gardens' during the Ranjit Singh period.<ref>[http://nation.com.pk/columns/23-Sep-2010/Some-vanished-gardens-of-Lahore, The Nation newspaper, Published 23 September 2010, Retrieved 27 February 2017]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://lahore.city-history.com/places/hazori-bagh/ |title=Hazori Bagh |website=lahore.city-history.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421163950/http://lahore.city-history.com/places/hazori-bagh/ |archive-date=21 April 2019|access-date=27 February 2017}}</ref> Later, British maps of the area surrounding Lahore dating from the mid-19th century show many walled private gardens which were confiscated from the Muslim noble families bearing the names of prominent Sikh nobles – a pattern of patronage which was inherited from the Mughals.

While much of Lahore's Mughal-era fabric lay in ruins by the time of his arrival, Ranjit Singh's army's plundered most of Lahore's most precious Mughal monuments, and stripped the white marble from several monuments to send to different parts of the Sikh Empire.{{sfnp|Sidhwa|2005|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}} Monuments plundered of their marble include the [[Tomb of Asif Khan]] and the [[Tomb of Nur Jahan]]; the [[Shalimar Gardens, Lahore|Shalimar Gardens]] was plundered of much of its marble, and its costly [[agate]] gate was stripped.{{sfnp|Latif|1892|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}}<ref name="Archaeological Survey of India"/> The Sikh state also demolished a number of shrines and monuments laying outside the city's walls.{{sfnp|Latif|1892|p=87}}

Still, Sikh rule left Lahore with several monuments, and a heavily altered Lahore Fort. Ranjit Singh's rule restored some of Lahore's previous grandeur,{{sfnp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}} and the city was left with a large number of religious monuments from this period. Several havelis were built during this era, though only a few still remain.{{sfnp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}}

====British period====
[[File:Front elevation, Aitchison College.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A syncretic architectural style that blends Islamic, Hindu, and Western motifs took root during the colonial era, as shown at [[Aitchison College]].]]
[[File:Tollington market, Mall Road, Lahore, Pakistan.jpg|thumb|Much of old Lahore features colonial-era buildings, such as the Tollinton Market.]]
As the capital of British Punjab, the city derived much of its architecture from British colonialists. Structures were built predominantly in the [[Indo-Gothic]] style – a syncretic architectural style that blends elements of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and [[Islamic architecture]] o r in the distinct [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture|Indo-Saracenic style]]. The British also built [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] Montgomery Hall, which today serves as the [[Quaid-e-Azam Library]].<ref>{{harvp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}}. "Montgomery Hall faced inward, toward the main avenue of what would become a and reading room, a teak dance and "rinking"floor (skating rink), and room for the Gymkhana Club. Lawrence Hall was devoted to the white community in Lahore;the spaces and program of Montgomery Hall allowed for racial interaction between British civilians and officials and the elites of Lahori society."</ref>

[[Bagh-e-Jinnah, Lahore|Lawrence Gardens]] were also laid near Civil Station, and were paid for by donations solicited from both Lahore's European community, as well as from wealthy locals. The gardens featured over 600 species of plants, and were tended to by a horticulturist sent from London's [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew]].<ref>{{harvp|Glover|2008|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}}. "Like Lawrence and Montgomery Halls, moreover, the garden's major elements were all financed through a combination of provincial, municipal, and private funds from both British carefully isolated space of controlled cultural interaction underwritten by elite collaboration. Both the botanical garden and the zoo in Lawrence Gardens drafted a controlled display of exotic nature to the garden's overall didactic program. The botanical garden exhibited over six hundred species of plants, trees, and shrubs, all carefully tended by a horticulturist sent out from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew."</ref>

The leafy suburbs to the south of the Old City, as well as the Cantonment southwest of the Old City, were largely developed under British colonial rule, and feature colonial-era buildings built alongside leafy avenues.

The British authorities built several important structures around the time of the [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria]] in 1887 in the distinctive Indo-Saracenic style, such as the [[Lahore Museum]] and [[National College of Arts|Mayo School of Industrial Arts]].<ref name="Making Lahore Modern 1894" /> Other prominent examples of the Indo-Saracenic style in Lahore include Lahore's prestigious [[Aitchison College]], the Punjab Chief Court (today the [[Lahore High Court]]), [[Lahore Museum]], and the [[University of the Punjab]].

Many of Lahore's most important buildings were designed by civil engineer and architect [[Ganga Ram|Sir Ganga Ram]], who is considered "the father of modern Lahore".<ref name="Ahmed2001">{{cite book |author=Khaled Ahmed |title=Pakistan: behind the ideological mask : facts about great men we don't want to know |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hjRuAAAAMAAJ |publisher=[[Vanguard Press|Vanguard]] |year=2001 |isbn=978-969-402-353-3}}</ref><ref name="HaroonKhalid">{{cite web |author=Haroon Khalid |date=April 25, 2018 |title=Lahore owes Hindu philanthropist Ganga Ram more than it would care to admit |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1403799 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210522083126/https://www.dawn.com/news/1403799 |archive-date=22 May 2021 |access-date=February 27, 2022 |work=Dawn}}</ref><ref name="TheMilliGazette">{{cite web |author=Special Reports |date=September 4, 2015 |title='Father of Modern Lahore' remembered |work=[[The Milli Gazette]] |language=en |url=https://www.milligazette.com/news/12-special-reports/12813-father-of-modern-lahore-remembered/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220227085526/https://www.milligazette.com/news/12-special-reports/12813-father-of-modern-lahore-remembered/ |archive-date=February 27, 2022 |access-date=February 27, 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="TheSiasatDaily">{{cite web |last=Siraj |first=M.A. |date=May 21, 2021 |title=Pakistan reopens Samadhi of Ganga Ram, iconic engineer, philanthropist who rebuilt Lahore |url=https://www.siasat.com/pakistan-reopens-samadhi-of-ganga-ram-iconic-engineer-philanthropist-who-rebuilt-lahore-2139815/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210915081729/https://www.siasat.com/pakistan-reopens-samadhi-of-ganga-ram-iconic-engineer-philanthropist-who-rebuilt-lahore-2139815/ |archive-date=September 15, 2021 |access-date=February 27, 2022 |work=[[The Siasat Daily]] |language=en}}</ref><ref name="blogspot.com">{{cite web |last=Luqman |first=Tariq |date=November 15, 2018 |title=Sir Ganga Ram: The Father of Modern Lahore, our Khadim-Ala Punjab |url=https://tariqluqmanview.blogspot.com/2018/11/sir-ganga-ram-father-of-modern-lahore.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220227091728/https://tariqluqmanview.blogspot.com/2018/11/sir-ganga-ram-father-of-modern-lahore.html |archive-date=February 27, 2022 |access-date=February 27, 2022 |work=[[Blogger (service)|blogspot.com]] |language=en}}</ref><ref name="ThePrint">{{cite web |last=Sharma |first=Unnati |date=January 27, 2021 |title=Sir Ganga Ram's descendant Kesha Ram celebrates US senate seat in salwar kameez to show the way |url=https://theprint.in/world/sir-ganga-rams-descendant-kesha-ram-celebrates-us-senate-seat-in-salwar-kameez-to-show-the-way/593080/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220227093358/https://theprint.in/world/sir-ganga-rams-descendant-kesha-ram-celebrates-us-senate-seat-in-salwar-kameez-to-show-the-way/593080/ |archive-date=February 27, 2022 |access-date=February 27, 2022 |work=[[ThePrint]] |language=en}}</ref><ref name="thenews.com.pk">{{cite web |author=[[Mazhar Abbas]] |date=July 18, 2021 |title=A hard call—II |url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/865550-a-hard-callii |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220226063657/https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/865550-a-hard-callii |archive-date=February 26, 2022 |access-date=February 27, 2022 |work=[[The News International]] |language=en}}</ref><ref name="USCGLahoreTweet">{{cite tweet |number=1354046370303385601|user=USCGLahore |title=#DYK "the father of modern #Lahore", Sir Ganga Ram's great granddaughter Kesha Ram has become the State Senator of #Vermont #USA?

{{Main|List of parks and gardens in Lahore}}

[[File:Bagh-e-Jinnah Lahore Pakistan.jpg|thumb|Lahore's [[Bagh-e-Jinnah, Lahore|Bagh-e-Jinnah]] was laid in 1862 as the [[Bagh-e-Jinnah (Lahore)|Lawrence Garden]].]]
Lahore is also known as "the city of gardens" due to its large number of gardens. The [[Shahdara Bagh]] was one of the earliest [[Mughal garden]]s, laid out in 15th century, and contains the [[Tomb of Jahangir]]. The [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]] were laid out during the reign of [[Shah Jahan]] and were designed to mimic the [[Islamic]] paradise of the afterlife described in the [[Qur'an]]. The gardens follow the familiar [[charbagh]] layout of four squares, with three descending terraces. In 1818, [[Hazuri Bagh]] was built during reign of Ranjit Singh to celebrate his capture of the [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond from Shuja Shah Durrani.

The [[Bagh-e-Jinnah (Lahore)|Lawrence Garden]] was established in 1862 and was originally named after [[Sir John Lawrence]], late 19th-century British Viceroy to India. The Circular Garden, which surrounds the Walled City on three sides, was established by 1892.{{sfnp|Latif|1892|p={{pn|date=August 2024}}}} The former parade ground adjacent to Badshahi Mosque was also renamed during the British era as [[Greater Iqbal Park|Minto Park]], which after restoration was re-established as Iqbal Park.

The many other gardens and parks in the city include [[Hazuri Bagh]], [[Iqbal Park]], Mochi Bagh, [[Gulshan-e-Iqbal Park]], [[Model Town Park]], [[Jilani Park]], Nasir Bagh Lahore, [[Jallo Park]], [[Lahore Zoo Safari|Lahore Zoo Safari Park]], and [[Changa Manga]], a human-made forest near Lahore in the [[Kasur]] district.
