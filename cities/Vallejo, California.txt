'''Vallejo''' ({{IPAc-en|v|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ|(|h|)|oʊ}} {{respell|və|LAY|(h)oh}}; {{IPA|es|baˈʎexo|lang}}) is a city in [[Solano County, California]] and the second largest city in the [[North Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|North Bay]] region of the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]]. Located on the shores of [[San Pablo Bay]], the city had a population of 126,090 at the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Vallejo city, California |url= https://data.census.gov/cedsci/profile?g=1600000US0681666 |website=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=September 16, 2022}}</ref> Vallejo is home to the [[California State University Maritime Academy|California Maritime Academy]], [[Touro University California]] and [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]].

Vallejo is named after [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]], the famed [[Californio]] general and statesman. The city was founded in 1851 on Gen. Vallejo's [[Rancho Suscol]] to serve as the capital city of California, which it was 1852–1853, after which the [[Government of California|Californian government]] moved to neighboring [[Benicia, California|Benicia]], named in honor of Gen. Vallejo's wife [[Francisca Benicia Carrillo de Vallejo|Benicia Carrillo de Vallejo]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.citytowninfo.com/places/california/vallejo |title=Vallejo, California - City Information, Fast Facts, Schools, Colleges, and More |website=www.citytowninfo.com |access-date=January 17, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120211194532/http://www.citytowninfo.com/places/california/vallejo |archive-date=February 11, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]] was founded in 1854, and defined Vallejo's economy until the turn of the 21st century.

{{More citations needed|section|date=July 2023}}
[[File:Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Vallejo is named after Don [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]], the famed [[Californio]] general and statesman. The city was founded on his [[Rancho Suscol]].]]
Vallejo was once home of the [[Coast Miwok]] as well as [[Suisunes]] and other [[Patwin]] Native American tribes. There are three confirmed [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] sites located in the rock [[outcrop]]s in the hills above Blue Rock Springs Park. The California Archaeological Inventory has indicated that the three Indian sites are located on Sulphur Springs Mountain.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.cityofvallejo.net/our_city/about_vallejo/history |title=History |website=www.cityofvallejo.net}}</ref>

===Mexican era===
The city of Vallejo was once part of the {{convert|84000|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} [[Rancho Suscol]] Mexican land grant of 1843 by Governor [[Manuel Micheltorena]] to Gen. [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]]. The city was named after this Mexican military officer and title holder who was appointed in settling and overseeing the North Bay region. Gen. Vallejo was responsible for military peace in the region and founded the pueblo of Sonoma in 1836.

In 1846, independence-minded Anglo immigrants rose up against the Mexican government of California in what would be known as the [[California Republic|Bear Flag Revolt]] which resulted in Gen. Vallejo's imprisonment in [[Sutter's Fort]]. This was subsequently followed by the annexation of the California Republic to the United States. Gen. Vallejo, though a Mexican army officer, generally acquiesced in the annexation of California to the United States, recognizing the greater resources of the United States and benefits that would bring to California.

===Post-Conquest era===
[[File:View of Vallejo when it was Capital of California (1852-1853).jpg|thumb|left|Vallejo circa 1852–53, when it served as the [[capital city]] of California and seat of the [[Government of California|Californian government]].]]

[[File:Mare Island Shipyard at Night 1.jpg|thumb|left|Founded in 1854, [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard|Mare Island]] was the first [[naval base]] on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].]]
In 1851, Vallejo was declared to become the official California State Capitol, with the new government prepared to meet for the first time the following year. In 1852, the legislature convened for the first time. However, Vallejo did not follow through with constructing a Capitol State Building for them to meet in. In 1853, it was again the meeting place for the legislature, solely for the purpose of moving the capitol officially to [[Benicia, California|Benicia]], which occurred on February 4, 1853, after only a month. [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] is named after Vallejo's wife, [[Francisca Benicia Carrillo de Vallejo|Benicia de Vallejo]]. After the legislature left, the government established a [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard|naval shipyard]] on [[Mare Island]], which helped the city overcome the loss. Due to the presence of the shipyard, Filipinos began to immigrate to Vallejo beginning in the first decades of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book |first=Juanita |last=Tamayo Lott |author-link=Juanita Tamayo Lott |title=Common Destiny: Filipino American Generations |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_yD8ND6gMUsC&pg=PA2 |date=2006 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7425-4651-6 |page=2}}</ref> The yard functioned for over a hundred years, finally closing in 1996.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vallejomuseum.org/vallejo_history.htm |title=Vallejo Naval & Historic Museum - Welcome! |website=www.vallejomuseum.org |access-date=June 28, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070627095107/http://www.vallejomuseum.org/vallejo_history.htm |archive-date=June 27, 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The U.S. government appointed the influential Vallejo as Indian agent for Northern California. He also served on the state constitutional convention in 1849. Afterward, Vallejo remained active in state politics, but challenges to his land titles around Sonoma eventually left him impoverished and reduced his ranch from 250,000 acres to a mere 300. He eventually retired from public life, questioning the wisdom of his having welcomed the American acquisition of California in the first place. Vallejo died in 1890, a symbol of the eclipse of Californio wealth, power, and prestige.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/biographies/mariano_guadalupe_vallejo.html |title=The U.S.-Mexican War Biographies.

Although the town is named after Gen. Vallejo, the man regarded as the true founder of Vallejo is [[John B. Frisbie]]. After his daughter Epifania married Frisbie, Gen. Vallejo granted him power of attorney for the land grant. It was Frisbie who hired E. H. Rowe, the man who designed the city layout and who named the east–west streets after states and the north–south streets after California counties.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.visitvallejo.com/about-vallejo/ |title=Visit Vallejo, California – City of Vallejo, CA |website=www.visitvallejo.com |access-date=May 11, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090503114134/http://www.visitvallejo.com/about-vallejo/ |archive-date=May 3, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:Napa River in Vallejo.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Aerial view of Vallejo, showing [[San Pablo Bay]] to the center left and the [[Napa River]] dividing mainland Vallejo from [[Mare Island]] in the bottom left.]]
According to [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|49.5|sqmi|km2}}. Land area is {{convert|30.7|sqmi|km2}}, and {{convert|18.9|sqmi|km2}} (38.09%) is water. The [[Napa River]] flows until it changes into the Mare Island Strait in Vallejo which then flows into [[San Pablo Bay]], in the northeastern part of [[San Francisco Bay]].

Vallejo is located on the southwestern edge of [[Solano County, California]] in the [[North Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|North Bay]] region of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in Northern California. Vallejo borders the city of [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] to the east, American Canyon and the Napa county line to the north, the [[Carquinez Strait]] to the south and the [[San Pablo Bay]] to the west.

Several faults have been mapped in the vicinity of Vallejo. The [[San Andreas Fault]] and [[Hayward Fault]]s are the most [[active fault]]s, although the San Andreas is at some distance. Locally, the Sulphur Springs Valley Thrust Fault and Southampton Fault are found. No quaternary seismic activity along these minor faults has been observed with the possible exception of a slight offset revealed by trenching. The Sulphur Mountain and Green Valley faults have been associated with the [[Concord Fault]] to the south. The Concord Fault is considered active. 
[[File:Carquinez Strait aerial view.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Carquinez Bridge]] spans the [[Carquinez Strait]], connecting Vallejo (left) to [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa]] (right).]]
Historically there have been local [[cinnabar]] mines in the Vallejo area.<ref>C.Michael Hogan, Marc Papineau et al., ''Environmental Assessment of the Columbus Parkway Widening between Ascot Parkway and the Northgate Development, Vallejo'', Earth Metrics Inc. Report 7853, California State Clearinghouse, Sept 1989</ref>  The [[Hastings Mine]] and [[St. John's Mine]] contribute ongoing water contamination for [[mercury (element)|mercury]]; furthermore, mine shaft development has depleted much of this area's spring water. Both [[Rindler Creek]] and [[Blue Rock Springs Creek]] have been affected.

=== Climate ===
Vallejo has a mild, coastal [[Mediterranean climate]] and can be an average of {{convert|10|°F|°C|abbr=on}} cooler than nearby inland cities. Vallejo is influenced by its position on the northeastern shore of San Pablo Bay, but is less sheltered from heatwaves than areas directly on or nearer the Pacific Ocean/Golden Gate such as [[San Francisco]] and [[Oakland]]. Although slightly less marine, average temperatures range between {{convert|8|C|F}} in January and {{convert|19.8|C|F}} in July.<ref name="Weatherbase">{{cite web |url= http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=470640&cityname=Vallejo-California-United-States-of-America |title=Vallejo, California Temperature Averages |publisher=Weatherbase |access-date=March 5, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150402091549/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=470640&cityname=Vallejo-California-United-States-of-America |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> However, summer is very long with June–September being almost equal in historical average temperatures. This [[seasonal lag]] sees October averages being higher than in May<ref name="Weatherbase" /> in spite of it being after the [[Equinox]] (meaning less daylight than darkness).
