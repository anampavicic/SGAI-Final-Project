'''New Jersey''' is a state in both the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] regions of the United States. It is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population density|most densely populated]] state and at the center of the [[Northeast megalopolis]].

==History==
{{Main|History of New Jersey}}

===Prehistoric era===
{{See also|Paleontology in New Jersey}}
The pressure of collision between [[North America]] and [[Africa]] gave rise to the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. Around 18,000 years ago, the [[Wisconsin glaciation|Ice Age]] resulted in [[glacier]]s that reached New Jersey. As glaciers retreated, they left behind [[Lake Passaic]] along with rivers, [[meadow]]s, swamps, and [[gorge]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of the Great Swamp |url=https://www.greatswamp.org/history-great-swamp/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911024925/https://www.greatswamp.org/history-great-swamp/ |archive-date=September 11, 2017 |access-date=June 11, 2024 |website=greatswamp.org |publisher=Great Swamp Watershed Association |language=en-US}}</ref>

Since the [[6th millennium BC]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people have inhabited New Jersey, beginning with the [[Lenape|Lenape tribe]]. ''{{lang|unm|Scheyichbi}}'' is the [[Unami language|Lenape]] name for the land that represents present-day New Jersey.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stockton |first=Frank R. |year=1896 |title=The Story of the Discovery of Scheyichbi |url=http://www.getnj.com/storiesofnewjersey/sojpg9a.shtml |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104212625/http://www.getnj.com/storiesofnewjersey/sojpg9a.shtml |archive-date=January 4, 2014 |access-date=February 8, 2013 |website=Stories of New Jersey |publisher=GET NJ}}</ref> The Lenape were several [[Autonomy|autonomous]] groups that practiced [[maize]] agriculture in order to supplement their hunting and gathering in the region surrounding the [[Delaware River]], the lower [[Hudson River]], and western [[Long Island Sound]]. The Lenape were divided into [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] clans that were based upon common female ancestors. Clans were organized into three distinct [[phratry|phratries]] identified by their animal sign: [[Turtle]], [[Turkey (bird)|Turkey]], and [[Wolf]]. They first encountered the [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch]] in the early 17th century, and their primary relationship with the Dutch and later European settlers was through [[fur trade]].

===Colonial era===
{{Main|Colonial history of New Jersey|New Netherland|New Sweden|Province of New Jersey|East Jersey|West Jersey|Dominion of New England}}
[[File:Nieuw Nederland and Nya Sverige.svg|thumb|upright|A map of [[New Netherland]] and [[New Sweden]] in New Jersey during the [[Colonial history of New Jersey|colonial era]]]]
The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] were the first [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] to lay claim to lands in New Jersey. The Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]] consisted of parts of the modern [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic]] states. Although the European principle of [[land ownership]] was not recognized by the [[Lenape]], [[Dutch West India Company]] policy required its colonists to purchase land that they settled. The first to do so was [[Michiel Reyniersz Pauw|Michiel Pauw]], who established a patron ship called [[Pavonia, New Netherland|Pavonia]] in 1630 along [[North River (Hudson River)|North River]], that eventually became [[Bergen, New Netherland|Bergen]]. [[Peter Minuit]]'s purchase of lands along the [[Delaware River]] established the colony of [[New Sweden]], that lasted until the Dutch conquered it in 1655. Then the entire region became a territory of [[Kingdom of England|England]] on June 24, 1664, after an English fleet under command of Colonel [[Richard Nicolls]] sailed into what is now [[New York Harbor]] and took control of [[Fort Amsterdam]], annexing the entire province.

During the [[English Civil War]], the [[Channel Islands|Channel Island]] of [[Jersey]] remained loyal to the British Crown and gave sanctuary to the [[King of England|King]]. In the Royal Square in [[St Helier]], [[Charles II of England]] was proclaimed King in 1649, following the execution of his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. North American lands were divided by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who gave his brother, the Duke of York (later [[James II of England|King James II]]), the region between [[New England]] and [[Maryland]] as a [[proprietary colony]] (as opposed to a [[royal colony]]). James then granted land between the [[Hudson River]] and the [[Delaware River]] (the land that would become New Jersey) to two friends who had remained loyal through the [[English Civil War]]: [[George Carteret|Sir George Carteret]] and [[John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton|Lord Berkeley of Stratton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrnussbaum.com/readingcomp/njcolony.htm|title=New Jersey Colony Reading Comprehension|publisher=MrNussbaum.com|access-date=September 10, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024222527/http://www.mrnussbaum.com/readingcomp/njcolony.htm|archive-date=October 24, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The area was named the [[Province of New Jersey]].

Since its inception, New Jersey has been characterized by [[multiculturalism|ethnic and religious diversity]]. New England [[Congregationalists]] settled alongside [[Scots' Church, Melbourne|Scots Presbyterians]] and [[Dutch Reformed]] migrants. While the majority of residents lived in towns with individual [[landowner|landholdings]] of {{convert|100|acre|ha|0}}, a few rich proprietors owned vast estates. English [[Quakers]] and [[Anglicans]] owned large landholdings. Unlike [[Plymouth Colony]], [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and other colonies, New Jersey was populated by a secondary wave of immigrants who came from other colonies instead of those who migrated directly from Europe. New Jersey remained agrarian and rural throughout the colonial era, and [[commercial agriculture|commercial farming]] developed sporadically. Some townships, such as [[Burlington, New Jersey|Burlington]] on the Delaware River and [[Perth Amboy]], emerged as important ports for shipping to New York City and Philadelphia. The colony's fertile lands and [[toleration|tolerant religious policy]] drew more settlers, and New Jersey's population had increased to 120,000 by 1775.

Settlement for the first ten years of English rule took place along the [[Hackensack River]] and [[Arthur Kill]]. Settlers came primarily from New York and New England. On March 18, 1673, Berkeley sold his half of the colony to [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] in England, who settled the [[Delaware Valley]] region as a Quaker colony, with [[William Penn]] acting as [[trustee]] for the lands for a time. New Jersey was governed as two distinct provinces, [[East Jersey|East]] and [[West Jersey]], for 28 years between 1674 and 1702, which were part of the [[Dominion of New England]] from 1686 to 1689.

In 1702, the two provinces were reunited under a [[Royal Governor of New Jersey|royal governor]] rather than a [[Proprietary governor|proprietary one]]. [[Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon|Edward Hyde]], titled Lord Cornbury, became the first governor of the royal colony. Britain believed that he was an ineffective and corrupt ruler, taking bribes and speculating on land. In 1708, he was recalled to England. New Jersey was then ruled by the governors of New York, but this infuriated the settlers of New Jersey, who accused these governors of favoritism to New York. [[Lewis Morris (governor)|Judge Lewis Morris]] led the case for a separate governor, and was appointed governor by [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] in 1738.<ref>Streissguth pp. 30–36</ref>

New Jersey was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that revolted against British rule in the [[American Revolution]]. The [[s:New Jersey Constitution of 1776|New Jersey Constitution of 1776]] was passed July 2, 1776, just two days before the [[Second Continental Congress]] declared American Independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. It was an act of the [[Provincial Congress of New Jersey|Provincial Congress]], which made itself into the [[New Jersey Legislature|State Legislature]]. To reassure neutrals, it provided that it would become the legislature would disband if New Jersey reached reconciliation with Great Britain. Among the 56 [[Founding Fathers]] who signed the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], five were New Jersey representatives: [[Richard Stockton (Continental Congressman)|Richard Stockton]], [[John Witherspoon]], [[Francis Hopkinson]], [[John Hart (New Jersey politician)|John Hart]], and [[Abraham Clark]].

During the [[American Revolutionary War]], British and American armies crossed New Jersey numerous times, and several pivotal battles took place in the state. Because of this, New Jersey today is sometimes referred to as "The Crossroads of the American Revolution".<ref>{{cite web|title=About Crossroads of the American Revolution|url=http://revolutionarynj.org/about-crossroads-of-the-american-revolution/|publisher=Crossroads of the American Revolution|access-date=November 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104192948/http://revolutionarynj.org/about-crossroads-of-the-american-revolution/|archive-date=November 4, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The winter quarters of the [[Continental Army]] were established in New Jersey twice by General [[George Washington]] in [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]], which has been called "The Military Capital of the American Revolution."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Military Capital of the American Revolution|url=http://www.visitnj.org/article/military-capital-american-revolution|publisher=New Jersey Tourism|date=February 2014|access-date=November 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105231335/http://www.visitnj.org/article/military-capital-american-revolution|archive-date=November 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

On the night of December 25–26, 1776, the Continental Army under [[Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|George Washington crossed the Delaware River]]. After the crossing, they surprised and defeated the [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian troops]] in the [[Battle of Trenton]]. Slightly more than a week after victory at [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], Continental Army forces gained an important victory by stopping [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis's]] charges at the [[Second Battle of Trenton]]. By evading Cornwallis's army, the Continental Army was able to make a surprise attack on [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] and successfully defeated the British forces there on January 3, 1777. [[Emanuel Leutze]]'s painting of ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware (1851 painting)|Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'' became an icon of the Revolution.

Continental Army forces under Washington's command met British forces under General [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Henry Clinton]] at the [[Battle of Monmouth]] in an indecisive engagement in June 1778. Washington's forces attempted to take the British column by surprise. When the British army attempted to flank the Americans, the Continental Army retreated in disorder. Their ranks were later reorganized and withstood British charges.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/diglib/legacies/loc.afc.afc-legacies.200003296/ Battle of Monmouth: The Longest Battle of the American Revolution] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230127115945/http://memory.loc.gov/diglib/legacies/loc.afc.afc-legacies.200003296/ |date=January 27, 2023 }}, [[Library of Congress]].

In the summer of 1783, the [[Continental Congress]] met in [[Nassau Hall]] at [[Princeton University]], making [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] the nation's capital for four months. It was there that the Continental Congress learned of the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], which ended the war.

On December 18, 1787, New Jersey became the third state to ratify the [[United States Constitution]], which was overwhelmingly popular in New Jersey since it prevented New York and Pennsylvania from charging [[tariff]]s on goods imported from Europe. On November 20, 1789, New Jersey became the first in the newly formed Union to ratify the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].<ref>[https://www.nj.gov/state/archives/docusconstitution.html United States Constitution] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220705183803/https://www.nj.gov/state/archives/docusconstitution.html |date=July 5, 2022 }}, [[New Jersey Department of State]].

The 1776 [[Constitution of New Jersey|New Jersey State Constitution]] gave the vote to all inhabitants who had a certain level of wealth. This included women and Black people, but not married women because they were not legally permitted to own property separately from their husbands. Both sides, in several elections, claimed that the other side had had unqualified women vote and mocked them for use of petticoat electors, whether entitled to vote or not; on the other hand, both parties passed Voting Rights Acts. In 1807, legislature passed a bill interpreting the constitution to mean universal white male [[suffrage]], excluding paupers; the constitution was itself an act of the legislature and not enshrined as the modern constitution.<ref>Klinghoffer and Elkis ("The Petticoat Electors: Women's Suffrage in New Jersey, 1776–1807", ''Journal of the Early Republic'' 12, no. 2 (1992): 159–193.)</ref>

On February 15, 1804, New Jersey became the last northern state to [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolish]] new [[slavery]] and enacted legislation that slowly phased out existing slavery. This led to a gradual decrease of the slave population. By the [[American Civil War]]'s end, about a dozen African Americans in New Jersey were still held in bondage.<ref>James Gigantino, The Ragged Road to Abolition: Slavery and Freedom in New Jersey, 1775–1865</ref> New Jersey voters eventually ratified the constitutional amendments banning slavery and granting rights to the United States' black population.

Industrialization accelerated in the present-day [[North Jersey]] region of the state following completion of the [[Morris Canal]] in 1831. The canal allowed for [[anthracite|anthracite coal]] to be transported from eastern [[Pennsylvania]]'s [[Lehigh Valley]] to North Jersey's growing industries in [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], and [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]].

In 1844, the second [[New Jersey State Constitution|state constitution]] was ratified and brought into effect. Counties thereby became districts for the state senate, and some realignment of boundaries (including the creation of [[Mercer County, New Jersey|Mercer County]]) immediately followed. This provision was retained in the 1947 Constitution, but was overturned by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1962, by the decision ''[[Baker v. Carr]]''. While the Governorship was stronger than under the 1776 constitution, the constitution of 1844 created many offices that were not responsible to him, or to the people, and it gave him a three-year term, but he could not succeed himself.

New Jersey was one of the few Union states (the others being [[Delaware]] and [[Kentucky]]) to select a candidate other than [[Abraham Lincoln]] twice in national elections, and sided with [[Stephen A. Douglas]] (1860) and [[George B. McClellan]] (1864) during their campaigns. McClellan, a native Philadelphian, had New Jersey ties and formally resided in New Jersey at the time; he later became Governor of New Jersey (1878–81). (In New Jersey, the factions of the Democratic party managed an effective coalition in 1860.) During the [[American Civil War]], the state was led first by Republican governor [[Charles Smith Olden]], then by Democrat [[Joel Parker (politician)|Joel Parker]]. During the course of the war, between 65,000 and 80,000 soldiers from the state enlisted in the Union army; unlike many states, including some Northern ones, no battle was fought there.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Horowitz|first=Ben|date=June 23, 2015|title=10 facts about New Jersey and the Civil War|url=https://www.nj.com/morris/2015/06/ten_facts_about_new_jersey_and_the_civil_war.html|access-date=February 23, 2021|website=nj|archive-date=April 15, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210415013550/https://www.nj.com/morris/2015/06/ten_facts_about_new_jersey_and_the_civil_war.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the [[Industrial Revolution]], cities like [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]] grew and prospered. Previously, the economy had been largely agrarian, which was problematically subject to crop failures and poor soil. This caused a shift to a more [[industrialization|industrialized]] economy, one based on manufactured commodities such as textiles and silk. [[List of inventors|Inventor]] [[Thomas Edison]] also became an important figure of the Industrial Revolution, having been [[List of Edison patents|granted 1,093 patents]], many of which for inventions he developed while working in New Jersey. Edison's facilities, first at [[Menlo Park, New Jersey|Menlo Park]] and then in [[West Orange, New Jersey|West Orange]], are considered perhaps the first [[research center]]s in the United States. Christie Street in Menlo Park was the first thoroughfare in the world to have electric lighting. Transportation was greatly improved as [[locomotive|locomotion]] and [[steamboat]]s were introduced to New Jersey.

[[Iron ore|Iron]] mining was also a leading industry during the middle to late 19th century. [[Bog iron]] pits in the [[New Jersey Pine Barrens]] were among the first sources of iron for the new nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/nj/county/atlantic/Pinelands/BogIron.htm|title=Usgennet.org|publisher=Usgennet.org|access-date=July 25, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514000706/http://www.usgennet.org/usa/nj/county/atlantic/Pinelands/BogIron.htm|archive-date=May 14, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Mines such as Mt. Hope, Mine Hill, and the Rockaway Valley Mines created a thriving industry. Mining generated the impetus for new towns and was one of the driving forces behind the need for the [[Morris Canal]]. [[Zinc]] mines were also a major industry, especially the [[Sterling Hill Mine]].

New Jersey is located at the center of the [[Northeast megalopolis]], the most populated American [[urban agglomeration]]. It is bordered on the north and northeast by [[New York (state)|New York]] (parts of which are across the [[Hudson River]], [[Upper New York Bay]], the [[Kill Van Kull]], [[Newark Bay]], and the [[Arthur Kill]]); on the east by the Atlantic Ocean; on the southwest by [[Delaware]] across [[Delaware Bay]]; and on the west by [[Pennsylvania]] across the [[Delaware River]].

New Jersey is broadly divided into the [[North Jersey|North]], [[Central Jersey|Central]], and [[South Jersey]] geographic regions, although some residents do not consider Central Jersey a region in its own right. Across the regions are five distinct areas divided by natural geography and population concentration. Northeastern New Jersey, often referred to as the [[Gateway Region]], lies closest to [[Manhattan]] in New York City, and up to a million residents commute daily into the city for work, many via public transportation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wagner.nyu.edu/files/rudincenter/dynamic_pop_manhattan.pdf|title=The Dynamic Population of Manhattan|author1=Mitchell L.

South Jersey represents the southernmost geographical region of the [[northeastern United States]]. The [[Delaware Valley]] includes the southwestern counties of the state, which reside within the [[Delaware Valley]] surrounding [[Philadelphia]].

Despite its heavily urban character and a long history of [[industrialization]], forests cover roughly 45 percent of New Jersey's land area, or approximately {{Convert|2.1|e6acre}}, ranking 31st among the 50 U.S. states and six territories.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trends in New Jersey Forests|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/ne/newtown_square/publications/brochures/pdfs/state_forests/nj_forest.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511092612/https://www.fs.fed.us/ne/newtown_square/publications/brochures/pdfs/state_forests/nj_forest.pdf|archive-date=May 11, 2017|access-date=March 13, 2015|publisher=Department of Environmental Protection, N.J.

The chief tree of the northern forests is the [[oak]]. The [[New Jersey Pine Barrens]] is situated in the southern interior of New Jersey and covered extensively by mixed [[pine]] and [[oak]] forest; its population density is lower than most of the state.

Summers are typically hot and humid, with statewide average high temperatures of {{convert|82|-|87|F}} and lows of {{convert|60|-|69|F}}; however, temperatures exceed {{convert|90|°F|0}} on average 25 days each summer, exceeding {{convert|100|°F|0}} in some years. Winters are usually cold, with average high temperatures of {{convert|34|-|43|F|C}} and lows of {{convert|16|to|28|F}} for most of the state, but temperatures can, for brief periods, fall below {{convert|10|°F|0}} and sometimes rise above {{convert|50|°F}}. Northwestern parts of the state have significantly colder winters with sub-{{convert|0|°F|0}} being an almost annual occurrence. Spring and autumn may feature wide temperature variations, with lower humidity than summer. The [[Hardiness zone|USDA Plant Hardiness Zone]] classification ranges from{{nbsp}}6 in the northwest of the state, to 7B near Cape May.<ref>[http://www.arborday.org/treeinfo/zonelookup.cfm Hardiness Zone Lookup at] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324213157/http://www.arborday.org/treeinfo/zonelookup.cfm |date=March 24, 2013 }}.

Average annual precipitation ranges from {{convert|43|to|51|in|mm}}, spread uniformly throughout the year. Average snowfall per winter season ranges from {{convert|10|-|15|in|cm}} in the south and near the seacoast, {{convert|15|-|30|in|cm}} in the northeast and central part of the state, to about {{convert|40|-|50|in|m}} in the northwestern highlands, but this often varies considerably from year to year. Precipitation falls on an average of 120 days a year, with 25 to 30 thunderstorms, most of which occur during the summer.

During winter and early spring, New Jersey can experience [[nor'easter]]s, which are capable of causing [[blizzards]] or flooding throughout the northeastern United States. [[Hurricane]]s and [[tropical storm]]s, [[tornado]]es, and earthquakes are rare; the state was impacted by a hurricane in [[1903 New Jersey hurricane|1903]], Tropical Storm [[Hurricane Floyd|Floyd]] in [[1999 Atlantic hurricane season|1999]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Hurricane Floyd Impacts |url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/mhx/Floyd/Impacts.php |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603022704/http://www.erh.noaa.gov/mhx/Floyd/Impacts.php |archive-date=June 3, 2010 |access-date=June 5, 2011 |publisher=National Weather Service}}</ref> and [[Hurricane Sandy]] in [[2012 Atlantic hurricane season|2012]], which made landfall in the state with top winds of {{convert|90|mph|0|abbr=on}}.

==== Climate change ====
[[Climate change in New Jersey|Climate change is affecting New Jersey]] faster than much of the rest of the United States. [[Climatologist]]s at the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] have concluded that New Jersey has been the fastest-warming state by average air temperature over a 100-year period beginning in the early 20th century.<ref name=NewJerseyFastestWarmingState/>

==== Municipalities ====
For its overall population and nation-leading population density, New Jersey has a relative paucity of classic large cities. This [[paradox]] is most pronounced in [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]], the state's most populous county, whose 955,732 residents at the 2020 census inhabited 70 municipalities, of which the most populous is [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]], with 46,030 residents. Many urban areas extend far beyond the limits of a single large city, as New Jersey municipalities tend to be geographically small; three of the four largest cities in New Jersey by population have under {{convert|20|sqmi}} of land area, and eight of the top ten, including all the top five, have a land area under {{convert|30|sqmi}}. {{As of|2010|alt=As of the [[2010 United States census]]}}, only four municipalities had over 100,000 residents (although Edison and Woodbridge Township came very close); this number increased to seven by the 2020 census.

Residents of New Jersey are most commonly referred to as New Jerseyans or, less commonly, as New Jerseyites. According to the [[2020 United States census|2020 U.S. census]], the state had a population of 9,288,994, a 5.7% increase since the [[2010 United States census|2010 U.S. census]], which counted 8,791,894 residents.<ref name="2020Census" /> The state ranked eleventh in the country by total population and first in population density, with 1,185 residents per square mile (458 per km<sup>2</sup>). Historically, New Jersey has experienced one of the fastest growth rates in the country, with its population increasing by double digits almost every decade until 1980; growth has since slowed but remained relatively robust until recently. In 2022, the Census Bureau estimated there were 6,262 fewer residents than in 2020, a decline of 0.3% from 2020, related to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/NJ |title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: New Jersey |access-date=August 22, 2021 |archive-date=July 18, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210718114426/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/NJ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Under the new law, teachers can now skip the exam and instead receive an alternate teaching certificate. | archive-date=December 3, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231203000626/https://13wham.com/news/nation-world/new-jersey-drops-basic-skills-requirement-for-new-teachers-caved-to-teacher-union-demands-education-association-reading-writing-math-proficiency-phil-murphy-crisis-in-the-classroom | url-status=live }}</ref>

====Scientific economy====
New Jersey has a strong [[scientist|scientific economy]] and is home to major pharmaceutical and telecommunications firms, drawing on the state's large and well-educated labor pool, including one of the highest concentrations of [[engineer]]s and other scientists in the world. There is also a robust service economy in retail sales, education, and real estate, serving residents who work in New York City or Philadelphia. [[Thomas Edison]] invented the first [[electric light bulb]] at his home in [[Menlo Park, New Jersey|Menlo Park, Edison]] in 1879.

====Shipping, manufacturing, and logistics====
Shipping is a key industry in New Jersey because of the state's strategic geographic location, the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]] being the busiest port on the East Coast. The [[Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal]] was the world's first [[container port]] and today is one of the world's largest. New Jersey's location at the center of the [[Eastern North America]]n population belt has made the state a prime hub for the logistics, warehousing, and [[supply chain]] management industries. The [[manufacturing]] economy in New Jersey had declined for several decades in the post-[[Industrial Revolution]] era but has since resumed growth.

New Jersey's location at the center of the [[Northeast megalopolis]] and its extensive transportation system have put over one-third of all United States residents and many Canadian residents within overnight distance by land. This accessibility to consumer revenue has enabled [[seaside resort]]s such as [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] and the remainder of the [[Jersey Shore]], as well as the state's other natural and cultural attractions, to contribute significantly to the record 111&nbsp;million tourist visits to New Jersey in 2018, providing US$44.7&nbsp;billion in tourism revenue, directly supporting 333,860 jobs, sustaining more than 531,000 jobs overall including peripheral impacts, and generating US$5&nbsp;billion in state and local tax revenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/business/2019/05/tourism-spending-is-up-in-nj-and-itll-be-even-better-when-american-dream-is-built-murphy-says.html|title=Tourism spending is up in N.J., and it'll be even better when American Dream is built, Murphy says|author=Bill Duhart|publisher=New Jersey On-Line LLC|date=May 9, 2019|access-date=May 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190510001420/https://www.nj.com/business/2019/05/tourism-spending-is-up-in-nj-and-itll-be-even-better-when-american-dream-is-built-murphy-says.html|archive-date=May 10, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

The double-decked [[George Washington Bridge]] carries the heaviest load of motor vehicle traffic of any bridge in the world, at 102&nbsp;million vehicles per year, across fourteen lanes.<ref name="panynj.gov"/><ref name=abcgwb/> It connects [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]] to the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] neighborhood of [[Upper Manhattan]], and carries [[Interstate 95]] and [[U.S. Route 1/9]] across the [[Hudson River]]. The [[Lincoln Tunnel]] connects to [[Midtown Manhattan]] carrying [[New Jersey Route 495]], and the [[Holland Tunnel]] connects to [[Lower Manhattan]] carrying [[Interstate 78 in New Jersey|Interstate 78]]. New Jersey is also connected to [[Staten Island]] by three bridges—from north to south, the [[Bayonne Bridge]], the [[Goethals Bridge]], and the [[Outerbridge Crossing]].

New Jersey has [[interstate compact]]s with all three of its neighboring states. The [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]], the [[Delaware River Port Authority]] (with [[Pennsylvania]]), the [[Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission]] (with Pennsylvania), and the [[Delaware River and Bay Authority]] (with [[Delaware]]) operate most of the major transportation routes in and out of the state. Bridge tolls are collected only from traffic exiting the state, with the exception of the private [[Dingman's Ferry Bridge]] over the Delaware River, which charges a toll in both directions.

It is unlawful for a customer to serve themselves gasoline in New Jersey. It became the last remaining U.S. state where all [[Filling station|gas stations]] are required to sell full-service gasoline to customers at all times in 2016, after [[Oregon]]'s introduction of restricted self-service gasoline availability took effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoodrivernews.com/news/2016/jan/06/self-serve-gas-legal-rural-oregon/|author=Patrick Mulvihill|title=Self-serve gas legal in rural Oregon|publisher=Eagle Newspapers, Inc|date=January 5, 2016|access-date=April 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513020831/http://www.hoodrivernews.com/news/2016/jan/06/self-serve-gas-legal-rural-oregon/|archive-date=May 13, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Airports===
[[File:NEC train 3967 passing through Rahway station, June 2007.jpg|thumb|A [[NJ Transit]] train on the [[Northeast Corridor]] in [[Rahway, New Jersey|Rahway]]]]
[[Newark Liberty International Airport]] (EWR) is one of the [[List of the busiest airports in the United States|busiest airports]] in the United States. Operated by the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]], it is one of the three main airports serving the [[New York metropolitan area]], along with [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] and [[LaGuardia Airport]], which are both in Queens, New York. [[United Airlines]] is the airport's largest tenant, operating an entire terminal (Terminal C) there, which it uses as one of its primary [[Airline hub|hubs]]. [[FedEx Express]] operates a large [[cargo terminal]] at EWR as well. The adjacent [[Newark Liberty International Airport (NJT station)|Newark Airport railroad station]] provides access to [[Amtrak]] and [[NJ Transit]] trains along the [[Northeast Corridor Line]].

Two smaller commercial airports, [[Atlantic City International Airport]] and rapidly growing [[Trenton-Mercer Airport]], also operate in other parts of the state. [[Teterboro Airport]] in [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]] and [[Millville Municipal Airport]] in [[Cumberland County, New Jersey|Cumberland County]] are [[general aviation]] airports popular with [[private aviation|private]] and [[corporate aviation|corporate aircraft]] due to their proximity to New York City and the [[Jersey Shore]], respectively.

[[File:MVCapeHenlopen.jpg|thumb|[[Cape May–Lewes Ferry]] connects New Jersey and [[Delaware]] across [[Delaware Bay]].]]
[[NJ Transit]] operates extensive rail and bus service throughout the state. A state-run corporation, it began with the consolidation of several private bus companies in [[North Jersey]] in 1979. In the early 1980s, it acquired [[Conrail]]'s commuter train operations that connected suburban towns to New York City. NJ Transit has [[NJ Transit Rail Operations|12 rail lines]] that run through different parts of the state and 165 stations statewide.<ref>{{Cite web |title=NJT Facts at a Glance |url=https://www.njtransit.com/about/facts-glance |access-date=December 18, 2023 |archive-date=May 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200516055259/https://www.njtransit.com/about/facts-glance |url-status=live }}</ref> Most of the lines end at either [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] in New York City or [[Hoboken Terminal]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], although some lines serve service to both terminal stations. One line provides service between [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] and [[Philadelphia]].

NJ Transit also operates three [[light rail]] systems in the state. The [[Hudson-Bergen Light Rail]] connects [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne]] to [[North Bergen, New Jersey|North Bergen]], through [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]] and [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]]. The [[Newark Light Rail]] is partially underground, and connects downtown [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] with other parts of the city and its suburbs, [[Belleville, New Jersey|Belleville]] and [[Bloomfield, New Jersey|Bloomfield]]. The [[River Line (New Jersey Transit)|River Line]] connects [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], and [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]].

The [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] is a [[rapid transit]] system consisting of four lines operated by the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]]. It links [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], [[Harrison, New Jersey|Harrison]], and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] with New York City. The [[PATCO Speedline]] is a rapid transit system that links [[Camden County, New Jersey|Camden County]] to Philadelphia. Both the PATCO and the PATH are two of only five rapid transit systems in the United States to operate 24 hours a day.

[[Amtrak]] operates numerous long-distance passenger trains in New Jersey, both to and from neighboring states and around the country. In addition to the Newark Airport connection, other major Amtrak railway stations include [[Trenton (Amtrak station)|Trenton Transit Center]], [[Metropark (NJT station)|Metropark]], and the historic [[Pennsylvania Station (Newark)|Newark Penn Station]].

The [[SEPTA|Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority]], or SEPTA, has two commuter rail lines that operate into New Jersey. The [[Trenton Line]] terminates at the [[Trenton Transit Center]], and the [[West Trenton Line (SEPTA)|West Trenton Line]] terminates at the [[West Trenton Rail Station]] in [[Ewing, New Jersey|Ewing]].

[[AirTrain Newark]] is a [[monorail]] connecting the Amtrak/NJ Transit station on the Northeast Corridor to the airport's terminals and parking lots.

Some private bus carriers still remain in New Jersey. Most of these carriers operate with state funding to offset losses and state owned buses are provided to these carriers, of which [[Coach USA]] companies make up the bulk. Other carriers include private charter and tour bus operators that take gamblers from other parts of New Jersey, New York City, Philadelphia, and [[Delaware]] to the casino resorts of Atlantic City.

===Ferries===
[[NY Waterway|New York Waterway]] has ferry terminals at [[Belford, New Jersey|Belford]], [[Jersey City]], Hoboken, [[Weehawken]], and [[Edgewater, New Jersey|Edgewater]], with service to different parts of Manhattan.

New Jersey currently has six teams from [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major professional sports leagues]] playing in the state, although one [[Major League Soccer]] team and two [[National Football League]] teams identify themselves as being from the [[New York metropolitan area]].

===Professional sports===
[[File:Pudcentnewarkjeh.JPG|thumb|[[Prudential Center]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], home of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[New Jersey Devils]]]]
The [[National Hockey League]]'s [[New Jersey Devils]], based in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] at the [[Prudential Center]], is the only major league [[sports franchise]] to bear the state's name. Founded in 1974 in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], as the [[Kansas City Scouts]], the team played in [[Denver, Colorado]], as the [[Colorado Rockies (NHL)|Colorado Rockies]] from 1976 until the spring of 1982 when naval architect, businessman, and [[Jersey City]] native [[John J. McMullen]] purchased, renamed, and moved the franchise to [[Brendan Byrne Arena]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey|East Rutherford's]] [[Meadowlands Sports Complex]]. While the team was poor to mediocre in Kansas City, Denver, and its first years in New Jersey, qualifying for the playoffs once in the 13 seasons from 1974 to 1987, the Devils ultimately established themselves in late 1980s and early 1990s during the tenure of Hall of Fame president and general manager [[Lou Lamoriello]]. As of 2023, the Devils have appeared in 23 postseasons in 40 seasons in New Jersey, reaching five [[Stanley Cup]] Finals (most recently in [[2012 Stanley Cup playoffs|2012]]) and winning it in [[1995 Stanley Cup playoffs|1995]], [[2000 Stanley Cup playoffs|2000]], and [[2003 Stanley Cup playoffs|2003]]. The organization is the youngest of the nine "Big Four" major league teams based in New York metropolitan area, ultimately establishing its core following throughout the northern and central portions of the state and carving a place in a media market once dominated by the [[New York Rangers]] and [[New York Islanders|Islanders]] which has the distinction of being the only metropolitan area in the country with three major league professional sports teams participating in the same sport.

The Meadowlands Sports Complex is home to the [[Meadowlands Racetrack]], one of three major [[harness racing]] tracks in the state. The Meadowlands Racetrack and [[Freehold Raceway]] in Freehold are two of the major harness racing tracks in North America. [[Monmouth Park Racetrack]] in Oceanport is a popular spot for [[thoroughbred racing]] in New Jersey and the northeast. It hosted the [[Breeders' Cup]] in 2007, and its turf course was renovated in preparation.

===College sports===
{{See also|List of college athletic programs in New Jersey}}

====Major schools====
New Jerseyans' collegiate allegiances are predominantly split among the three major [[NCAA Division I]] programs in the state: the [[Rutgers University–New Brunswick|Rutgers University]] (New Jersey's flagship state university) [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights|Scarlet Knights]], members of the [[Big Ten Conference]]; the [[Seton Hall University]] (the state's largest [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]] university) [[Seton Hall Pirates|Pirates]], members of the [[Big East Conference]]; and the [[Princeton University]] (the state's [[Ivy League]] university) [[Princeton Tigers|Tigers]].

The intense rivalry between Rutgers and Princeton athletics began with the [[1869 college football season|first intercollegiate football game]] in 1869. The schools have not met on the football field since 1980, but they continue to play each other annually in all other sports offered by the two universities.

Rutgers, which fields 24 teams in various sports, is nationally known for its football program, with a 6–4 all-time [[bowl game|bowl]] record; and its women's basketball programs, which appeared in a [[2007 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament|National Final]] in 2007. In 2008 and 2009, Rutgers expanded their football home, [[SHI Stadium|Rutgers Stadium]], now called SHI Stadium, on the [[Busch Campus of Rutgers University|Busch Campus]]. The basketball teams play at the [[Rutgers Athletic Center]] on [[Livingston Campus (Rutgers University)|Livingston Campus]]. Both venues and campuses are in [[Piscataway Township, New Jersey|Piscataway]], across the [[Raritan River]] from [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]]. The university also fields men's basketball and baseball programs. Rutgers' fans live mostly in the western parts of the state and [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County]]; its alumni base is the largest in the state.

Rutgers' satellite campuses in Camden and Newark each field their own athletic programs—the [[Rutgers–Camden Scarlet Raptors]] and the [[Rutgers–Newark Scarlet Raiders]]—which both compete in NCAA [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]].

Seton Hall fields no football team, but its men's basketball team is one of the [[Big East Conference|Big East]]'s storied programs. No New Jersey team has won more games in the [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament]], and it is the state's only men's basketball program to reach a modern [[1989 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|National Final]]. The Pirates play their home games at [[Prudential Center]] in downtown [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], about {{Convert | 4 | mi | 0}} from the university's [[South Orange, New Jersey|South Orange]] campus. Their fans hail largely from the predominantly Roman Catholic areas of the northern part of the state and the [[Jersey Shore]]. The annual inter-conference rivalry game between Seton Hall and Rutgers, whose venue alternates between Newark and Piscataway, the Garden State Hardwood Classic, is planned through 2026.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.app.com/story/sports/college/2018/04/30/rutgers-seton-hall-basketball-garden-state-hardwood-classic/563768002/ |title=Rutgers vs. Seton Hall basketball series formally extended |work=Ashbury Park Press |last=Carino |first=Jerry |date=April 30, 2018 |access-date=August 5, 2021 |archive-date=January 29, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220129233047/https://www.app.com/story/sports/college/2018/04/30/rutgers-seton-hall-basketball-garden-state-hardwood-classic/563768002/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Other schools====
The state's other Division I schools include the [[Monmouth Hawks|Monmouth University Hawks]] (West Long Branch), the [[NJIT Mens Soccer|New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) Highlanders]] (Newark), the [[Rider University#Athletics|Rider University Broncs]] (Lawrenceville), and the [[Saint Peter's College, New Jersey#Athletics|Saint Peter's University Peacocks and Peahens]] (Jersey City).

[[Fairleigh Dickinson Knights|Fairleigh Dickinson University]] competes in both Division I and Division III. It has two campuses, each with its own sports teams. The teams at the Metropolitan Campus are known as the FDU Knights, and compete in the [[Northeast Conference]] and NCAA Division I. The college at Florham (FDU-Florham) teams are known as the FDU-Florham Devils and compete in the [[Middle Atlantic Conferences#Freedom Conference|Middle Atlantic Conferences' Freedom Conference]] and NCAA Division III.

Among the various Division III schools in the state, the [[Stevens Tech Ducks football|Stevens Institute of Technology]] Ducks have fielded the longest continuously running collegiate men's lacrosse program in the country. 2009 marked the 125th season.

===High school===
New Jersey high schools are divided into divisions under the [[New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association]] (NJSIAA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njsiaa.org/|title=NJSIAA—New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association—NJSIAA|access-date=March 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525203826/http://www.njsiaa.org/|archive-date=May 25, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>'<ref>[http://www.ihigh.com/NJ/ New Jersey High School News and Sports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418224118/http://www.ihigh.com/NJ/ |date=April 18, 2009 }}. iHigh.com, Inc—The High School Internet Network.

The position of Governor of New Jersey is one of the most powerful in the nation. The governor is elected on a ticket with their lieutenant governor as the only statewide elected executive officials in the state; the governor appoints the entire executive cabinet and judges of the Supreme and Superior Courts. [[Phil Murphy]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]) is the [[Governor of New Jersey|governor]]. The governor's mansion is [[Drumthwacket]], located in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]].

Before 2010, New Jersey was one of the few states without a [[Lieutenant governor (United States)|lieutenant governor]]. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Kim Guadagno]] was elected the first [[Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey|lieutenant governor of New Jersey]] on the Republican ticket with Governor [[Chris Christie]] and took office on January 19, 2010. The position was created as the result of a [[Constitutional amendment]] to the [[New Jersey State Constitution]] passed by the voters in 2005. Previously a gubernatorial vacancy would be filled by the president of the [[New Jersey State Senate]] as acting governor, thus directing half of the legislative and all of the executive process.

===Legislative===
{{Main|New Jersey Legislature}}
[[File:New Jersey State House.jpg|thumb|The design of the dome-capped [[New Jersey State House]] in [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] differs from most other U.S. state houses in not resembling the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]].]]
The current version of the [[New Jersey State Constitution]] was adopted in 1947. It provides for a [[bicameral]] [[New Jersey Legislature]], consisting of an [[upper house]] [[New Jersey Senate|Senate]] of 40 members and a [[lower house]] [[New Jersey General Assembly|General Assembly]] of 80 members. Each of the 40 legislative districts elects one state senator and two Assembly members. Assembly members are elected for a two-year term in all odd-numbered years; state senators are elected in years ending in 1, 3, and{{nbsp}}7 and thus serve either four- or two-year terms.

New Jersey is one of only five states that elects its state officials in odd-numbered years (the others are [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Virginia]]). New Jersey holds elections for these offices every four years, in the year following each federal Presidential election year.

===Judicial===
{{main|Judiciary of New Jersey}}
The [[New Jersey Supreme Court]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/supreme/index.htm|title=Supreme Court of New Jersey|publisher=Judiciary.state.nj.us|access-date=July 25, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216011351/http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/supreme/index.htm|archive-date=December 16, 2008}}</ref> consists of a chief justice and six associate justices. All are appointed by the governor with the [[advice and consent]] of a majority of the membership of the state senate. Justices serve an initial seven-year term, after which they can be reappointed to serve until age 70.

Most of the day-to-day work in the New Jersey courts is carried out in the Municipal Court, where simple traffic tickets, minor criminal offenses, and small civil matters are heard.

More serious criminal and civil cases are handled by the [[New Jersey Superior Court|Superior Court]] for each county. All Superior Court judges are appointed by the governor with the [[advice and consent]] of a majority of the membership of the state senate. Each judge serves an initial seven-year term and can be reappointed to serve until age 70. New Jersey's judiciary is unusual in that it still has separate courts of law and [[equity (law)|equity]], like its neighbor [[Delaware]] but unlike most other U.S. states. The [[New Jersey Superior Court]] is divided into Law and Chancery Divisions at the trial level; the Law Division hears both criminal cases and civil lawsuits where the plaintiff's primary remedy is [[damages]], while the Chancery Division hears family cases, civil suits where the plaintiff's primary remedy is equitable relief, and probate trials.

The Superior Court also has an [[New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division|Appellate Division]], which functions as the state's intermediate [[appellate court]]. Superior Court judges are assigned to the Appellate Division by the Chief Justice.

There is also a Tax Court, which is a court of limited jurisdiction. Tax Court judges hear appeals of tax decisions made by County Boards of Taxation. They also hear appeals on decisions made by the director of the Division of Taxation on such matters as state income, sales and business taxes, and homestead rebates. Appeals from Tax Court decisions are heard in the Appellate Division of Superior Court. Tax Court judges are appointed by the governor for initial terms of seven years, and upon reappointment are granted tenure until they reach the mandatory retirement age of 70. There are 12 Tax Court judgeships.

===Counties===
{{Further|List of New Jersey counties}}

New Jersey is divided into 21 counties; 13 date from the colonial era. New Jersey was completely divided into counties by 1692; the present counties were created by dividing the existing ones; most recently [[Union County, New Jersey|Union County]] in 1857.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kent |first1=Spencer |title=How NJ's 21 counties got their names |url=https://www.nj.com/expo/news/g66l-2019/02/4a5f4485007948/how-njs-21-counties-got-their-names.html |website=The Star-Ledger |date=February 14, 2019 |access-date=February 14, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190214233929/https://www.nj.com/expo/news/g66l-2019/02/4a5f4485007948/how-njs-21-counties-got-their-names.html |archive-date=February 14, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> New Jersey was formerly the only state in the nation where elected county officials were called "freeholders". Elected county officials are now called county commissioners as of bill S855 signed by Governor Murphy on August 8, 2020. The county commissioners govern each county as part of its own [[Board of County Commissioners (New Jersey)|Board of Chosen County Commissioners]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Office of the Governor {{!}} Governor Murphy Signs Legislation to Eliminate the Title of "Freeholder" from Public Office|url=https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/20200821b.shtml|access-date=December 21, 2021|website=www.nj.gov|archive-date=December 21, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211221021006/https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/20200821b.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref> The number of county commissioners in each county is determined by referendum, and must consist of three, five, seven or nine members.

Depending on the county, the executive and [[legislative]] functions may be performed by the [[Board of County Commissioners (New Jersey)|Board of County Commissioners]] or split into separate branches of government. In 16 counties, the County Commissioners perform both legislative and executive functions on a commission basis, with each commissioner assigned responsibility for a department or group of departments. In the other five counties ([[Atlantic County, New Jersey|Atlantic]], [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen]], [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex]], [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson]] and [[Mercer County, New Jersey|Mercer]]), there is a directly elected [[County Executive]] who performs the executive functions while the commissioners retain a legislative and oversight role. In counties without an Executive, a County Administrator (or County Manager) may be hired to perform day-to-day administration of county functions.<ref>Hill, Michael. [https://www.njspotlightnews.org/video/the-structure-and-role-of-county-government-in-new-jersey/ "The structure and role of county government in New Jersey"], NJ Spotlight News, February 25, 2019. Retrieved July 15, 2022. "Atlantic, Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Mercer Counties have the freeholder-executive form. Union County's freeholders select a manager who can veto some of their actions. The other 15 counties have freeholders — 3 to 9 members depending on population. They appoint a chair or president, and the freeholders themselves take on the executive branch duties, such as running different departments." {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230715014157/https://www.njspotlightnews.org/video/the-structure-and-role-of-county-government-in-new-jersey/ |date=July 15, 2023 }}.</ref>

{{Further|List of municipalities in New Jersey}}
New Jersey currently has 564 municipalities; the most recent dissolution of a municipality was when [[Pine Valley, New Jersey|Pine Valley]] merged into [[Pine Hill, New Jersey|Pine Hill]] on January 1, 2022.

====Forms of municipal government====
{{NJmunigov}}

Starting in the 20th century, largely driven by reform-minded goals, a series of six modern forms of government was implemented. This began with the [[Walsh Act (New Jersey)|Walsh Act]], enacted in 1911 by the [[New Jersey Legislature]], which provided for a three- or five-member commission elected on a non-partisan basis. This was followed by the [[1923 Municipal Manager Law]], which offered a non-partisan council, provided for a weak mayor elected by and from the members of the council, and introduced a [[Council-manager government]] structure with an appointed manager responsible for the day-to-day administration of municipal affairs.

The [[Faulkner Act (New Jersey)|Faulkner Act]], originally enacted in 1950 and substantially amended in 1981, offers four basic plans: [[Faulkner Act (Mayor-Council)|Mayor-Council]], [[Faulkner Act (Council-Manager)|Council-Manager]], [[Faulkner Act (Small Municipality)|Small Municipality]], and [[Faulkner Act (Mayor-Council-Administrator)|Mayor-Council-Administrator]]. The act provides many choices for communities with a preference for a strong executive and professional management of municipal affairs and offers great flexibility in allowing municipalities to select the characteristics of its government: the number of seats on the council; seats selected at-large, by wards, or through a combination of both; staggered or concurrent terms of office; and a mayor chosen by the council or elected directly by voters. Most large municipalities and a majority of New Jersey's residents are governed by municipalities with Faulkner Act charters. Municipalities can also formulate their own unique form of government and operate under a [[Special Charter (New Jersey)|Special Charter]] with the approval of the [[New Jersey Legislature]].<ref>Cerra, Michael F. [https://www.njlm.org/809/3982/Forms-of-Govt-Magazine-Article "Forms of Government: Everything You've Always Wanted to Know, But Were Afraid to Ask"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220716084544/https://www.njlm.org/809/3982/Forms-of-Govt-Magazine-Article |date=July 16, 2022 }}, [[New Jersey State League of Municipalities]], March 2007. Retrieved July 15, 2022.</ref>

While municipalities retain their names derived from types of government, they may have changed to one of the modern forms of government, or further in the past to one of the other traditional forms, leading to municipalities with formal names quite baffling to the general public. For example, though there are four municipalities that are officially of the village type, none use the village form of government. [[Loch Arbour, New Jersey|Loch Arbour]] and [[Ridgefield Park, New Jersey|Ridgefield Park]] (now with a Walsh Act form), [[Ridgewood, New Jersey|Ridgewood]] (now with a Faulkner Act Council-Manager charter) and [[South Orange, New Jersey|South Orange]] (now operates under a [[Special Charter (New Jersey)|Special Charter]]) all migrated to other non-village forms.<ref>Liberman, Si.

The vote in the special election means that Loch Arbour is still a village, at least for now, but the town will have three commissioners elected at the same time every four years.... The special election to change the form of government under the Walsh Act is part of a number of steps being taken in search of an answer to a very high school-tax bill, which residents were forced to take on after the state in 2008 ended a special financial deal the village worked out with Ocean Township a decade ago to keep school taxes low."</ref>

New Jersey also has some of the most stringent [[gun control]] laws in the U.S. These include bans on [[assault weapon|assault firearms]], hollow-nose bullets and slingshots. No gun offense in New Jersey is graded less than a felony. [[BB guns]] and black-powder guns are all treated as modern firearms. New Jersey does not recognize out-of-state gun licenses and aggressively enforces its own gun laws.<ref>[http://www.nraila.org/statelawpdfs/NJSL.pdf NRAILA.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210170131/http://www.nraila.org/statelawpdfs/NJSL.pdf |date=December 10, 2011 }}</ref>

The measure passed by a two-thirds vote. At the time the measure was enacted, about a dozen other U.S. states had also legalized the sale and possession of marijuana. As of 2024, local governments and municipalities are still in the process of regulating marijuana-related businesses within their jurisdictions.

New Jersey is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] stronghold. [[New Jersey Democratic State Committee|New Jersey Democrats]] have majority control of both houses of the [[New Jersey Legislature]] (Senate, 24–16, and Assembly, 46–34), 9–3 split of the state's twelve seats in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], and both [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seats. There have been recent Republican governors, however: [[Christine Todd Whitman]] won election in 1993 and 1997 and [[Chris Christie]] in 2009 and 2013.

In federal elections, the state leans heavily towards the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], having last voted for a Republican for president in 1988. New Jersey was a crucial [[swing state]] in the elections of [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]], [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]], and [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]]. The last elected Republican to hold a Senate seat from New Jersey was [[Clifford P. Case]] in 1979. Newark Mayor [[Cory Booker]] was elected in October 2013 to join [[Bob Menendez|Robert Menendez]] to make New Jersey the first state with concurrently serving black and Latino U.S. senators.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/10/booker_and_menendez_form_historic_duo_as_first_black_and_latino_senators_from_the_same_state.html|title=Booker and Menendez form historic duo as first black and Latino senators from the same state|author=David Giambusso|newspaper=The Star-Ledger|date=October 20, 2013|access-date=October 20, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021101504/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/10/booker_and_menendez_form_historic_duo_as_first_black_and_latino_senators_from_the_same_state.html|archive-date=October 21, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>
