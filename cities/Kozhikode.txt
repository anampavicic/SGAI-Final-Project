==Etymology==
The exact origin of the name Kozhikode is uncertain. According to many sources, the name Kozhikode is derived from ''Koyil-kota'' (fort), meaning "fortified palace".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Kerala District Gazetteers: Kozhikode - Gazetteer of India, ''Volume 5 of Kerala District Gazetteers, Kerala (India)''

In the 14th century, Kozhikode conquered larger parts of central Kerala after the seize of [[Tirunavaya]] region from [[Kingdom of Valluvanad|Valluvanad]], which were under the control of the king of [[Kingdom of Cochin|''Perumbadappu Swaroopam'']] (Cochin). The ruler of [[Perumpadappu, Malappuram|Perumpadappu]] was forced to shift his capital (c. CE 1405) further south from [[Kodungallur]] to [[Kochi]]. In the 15th century, the status of Cochin was reduced to a vassal state of Kozhikode, thus leading to the emergence of Kozhikode as the most powerful kingdom in medieval [[Malabar Coast]].<ref name="askh"/> During the 15th century Kalaripayat was important in the history of [[Malabars|Malabar]], some warriors lived, most notably ''puthooram veettil'' [[Aromal Chekavar]] and his sister [[Unniyarcha]] who were chieftains of martial arts.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KYLpvaKJIMEC&q=Tiya&pg=PA316|title = Medieval Indian Literature: Surveys and selections|isbn = 9788126003655|last1 = Ayyappa Paniker|first1 = K.|year = 1997| publisher=Sahitya Akademi }}</ref><ref name="unni2nn">{{Cite book|last=Menon|first=A.

Kozhikode was the capital of an independent kingdom ruled by the [[samoothiri]]s (Zamorins) in the Middle Ages and later of the erstwhile [[Malabar District]] under British rule. [[Arab people|Arab]] merchants traded with the region as early as 7th century, and Portuguese explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] landed at Kozhikode on 20 May 1498, thus opening a trade route between Europe and India. A Portuguese [[trading post|factory]] and the fort was intact in Kozhikode for short period (1511–1525, until the [[Fall of Calicut (1526)|Fall of Calicut]]). The [[English East India Company|English]] landed in 1615 (constructing a trading post in 1665), followed by the [[French East India Company|French]] (1698) and the [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]] (1752). In 1765, [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] captured Kozhikode as part of its occupation of the Malabar Coast. Kozhikode, once a famous cotton-weaving centre, gave its name to the [[Calico (textile)|Calico cloth]].<ref name="Kozhikode 2011">"Kozhikode." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 18 November 2011.</ref>

===Early Kozhikode in foreign accounts===
Accounts of the city and the conditions prevailing then can be gleaned from the chronicles of travellers who visited the port city.
[[File:Uru.jpg|left|thumbnail|''[[Uru (boat)|Uru]]'', a type of ship that was historically used for maritime trade, built at [[Beypore]], Kozhikode]]
[[Ibn Battuta]] (1342–1347), who visited six times, gives the earliest glimpses of life in the city. He describes Kozhikode as "one of the great ports of the district of Malabar" where "merchants of all parts of the world are found here". The king of this place, he says, "shaves his chin just as the Haidari Fakeers of Rome do... The greater part of the Muslim merchants of this place are so wealthy that one of them can purchase the whole freightage of such vessels put here and fit out others like them".<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Ibn Battuta]], H.

He makes note of the 20 or 30 mosques built to cater to the religious needs of the Muslims, the unique system of calculation by the merchants using their fingers and toes (followed to this day) and the matrilineal system of succession.

[[Abdur Razzaq (traveller)|Abdur Razzak]] (1442–1443) the ambassador of Persian Emperor Sha-Rohk finds the city harbour perfectly secured and notices precious articles from several maritime countries especially from [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]], Zirbad and [[Zanzibar]].

The Italian [[Niccolò de' Conti]] (1445), perhaps the first Christian traveller who noticed Kozhikode, describes the city as abounding in pepper, lac, ginger, a larger kind of cinnamon, myrobalans and zedoary. He calls it a noble emporium for all India, with a [[circumference]] of {{convert|13|km|mi|0|abbr=off}}.

The Russian traveller Athanasius Nikitin or [[Afanasy Nikitin]] (1468–1474) calls 'Calecut' a port for the whole Indian sea and describes it as having a "big bazaar."

Other travellers who visited Kozhikode include the Italian [[Ludovico di Varthema]]<ref>Varthema, Ludovico di, ''The Travels of Ludovico di Varthema, A.D.1503–08'', translated from the original 1510 Italian ed. by John Winter Jones, Hakluyt Society, London</ref> (1503–1508) and [[Duarte Barbosa]].<ref>Gangadharan.

According to K.V. Krishna Iyer, the rise of Kozhikode is at once a cause and a consequence of Zamorin's ascendancy in Kerala. By the end of the 15th century, the Zamorin was at the zenith of his powers with all princes and chieftains of Kerala north of Kochi acknowledging his suzerainty.<ref name="Kunjali Maraikar">{{cite web|url=http://www.kozhikode.com/history.htm|title=Kozhikode (Calicut), Kerala, India - Kozhikode (Calicut) Hotels, Kozhikode (Calicut) resorts, Kozhikode (Calicut) tourism, Kozhikode (Calicut) real estate and Kozhikode (Calicut) businesses|website=Kozhikode.com|access-date=22 June 2019|archive-date=22 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622015007/http://www.kozhikode.com/history.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[S.

At the beginning of the 17th century the Zamorin expelled the Portuguese with the help of the [[Dutch East India Company]]. In 1602, the Zamorin sent messages to [[Aceh]] promising the Dutch a fort at Kozhikode if they would come and trade there. Two factors, Hans de Wolff and Lafer, were sent on an Asian ship from Aceh, but the two were captured by the chief of [[Tanur, Malappuram|Tanur]], and handed over to the Portuguese.<ref name="SanjaySubrahmanyam2">Sanjay Subrahmanyam.

==Climate==
Kozhikode has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Am''). A brief spell of pre-monsoon [[Mango showers]] hits the city sometime during April. However, the primary source of rain is the [[South-west monsoon]] that sets in the first week of June and continues until September. The city receives significant precipitation from the [[Northeast Monsoon|North-East Monsoon]] that sets in from the second half of October through November. This city has winter (December-February) hotter than summer (June-August), while spring (March-May) is the hottest season.
