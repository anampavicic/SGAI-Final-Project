==History==
{{main|History of Oxford}}
{{For timeline}}
[[File:Myles Birket Foster The High Oxford.jpg|thumb|left|19th-century view of the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]] in Oxford]]
The history of Oxford in England dates back to its original settlement in the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Saxon period]]. Originally of strategic significance due to its controlling location on the upper reaches of the [[River Thames]] at its confluence with the [[River Cherwell]], the town grew in national importance during the early [[Norman dynasty|Norman period]], and in the late 12th century became home to the fledgling [[University of Oxford]].<ref>{{cite web | title=A brief history of the University | url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/about_the_university/introducing_oxford/a_brief_history_of_the_university/ | publisher=[[University of Oxford]] | access-date=17 August 2012 | archive-date=2 March 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302031633/http://www.ox.ac.uk/about_the_university/introducing_oxford/a_brief_history_of_the_university/ | url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[Siege of Oxford (1142)|city was besieged]] during [[The Anarchy]] in 1142.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crouch|first=D.|title=The Reign of King Stephen: 1135–1154|edition=2nd|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-1-31789-297-7|page=203}}</ref>

During the Middle Ages Oxford had an important Jewish community, of which David of Oxford and his wife [[Licoricia of Winchester]] were prominent members.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Abrams |first=Rebecca |title=Licoricia of Winchester: Power and Prejudice in Medieval England |date=2022 |publisher=The Licoricia of Winchester Appeal |isbn=978-1-3999-1638-7 |edition=1st |location=Winchester |publication-date=2022 |pages=57–58 |language=en}}</ref>

The university rose to dominate the town. A heavily ecclesiastical town, Oxford was greatly affected by the changes of the [[English Reformation]], emerging as the [[Diocese of Oxford|seat of a bishopric]] and a full-fledged city. During the [[English Civil War]], Oxford housed the court of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and stood at the heart of national affairs.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hargreaves-Mawdsley |first=W. N. |url=http://archive.org/details/oxfordinageofjoh00harg |title=Oxford in the Age of John Locke |date=1973 |publisher=Norman, University of Oklahoma Press |isbn=978-0-8061-1038-7 |pages=41 |language=en}}</ref>

The city began to grow industrially during the 19th century, and had an industrial boom in the early 20th century, with major printing and car-manufacturing industries. These declined, along with other British heavy industry, in the 1970s and 1980s, leaving behind a city which had developed far beyond the university town of the past.<ref>{{cite book| first=James Stevens | last=Curl | title=The Erosion of Oxford | publisher=Oxford Illustrated Press Ltd | year=1977 | isbn=0-902280-40-6 }}</ref>

==Geography==
===Physical===
====Location====
Oxford's latitude and longitude are {{Coord|51|45|07|N|1|15|28|W|type:city_region:GB|display=inline}}, with Ordnance Survey {{gbmapping|SP513061}} (at [[Carfax Tower]], which is usually considered the centre). Oxford is {{convert|24|mi|km}} north-west of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], {{convert|26|mi|km}} north-east of [[Swindon]], {{convert|36|mi|km}} east of [[Cheltenham]], {{convert|43|mi|km}} east of [[Gloucester]], {{convert|29|mi|km}} south-west of [[Milton Keynes]], {{convert|38|mi|km}} south-east of [[Evesham]], {{convert|43|mi|km}} south of [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] and {{convert|51|mi|km}} west-north-west of [[London]]. The rivers [[River Cherwell|Cherwell]] and [[River Thames|Thames]] (also sometimes known as [[the Isis]] locally, supposedly from the Latinised name {{lang|la|Thamesis}}) run through Oxford and meet south of the city centre. These rivers and their flood plains constrain the size of the city centre.

====Climate====
Oxford has a [[oceanic climate|maritime temperate climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''). [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is uniformly distributed throughout the year and is provided mostly by weather systems that arrive from the [[Atlantic]]. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Oxford was {{convert|-17.8|°C|1|abbr=on}} on 24 December 1860. The highest temperature ever recorded in Oxford is {{convert|38.1|°C|0|abbr=on}} on 19 July 2022.<ref>{{cite web| url =https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/research/climate/rms/daily-data.html| title =Daily Data from the Radcliffe Observatory site in Oxford| access-date =24 June 2020| publisher =[[University of Oxford]]| archive-date =23 June 2020| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20200623115453/https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/research/climate/rms/daily-data.html| url-status =live}}</ref> The average conditions below are from the Radcliffe [[Meteorological Station]]. It has the longest series of temperature and rainfall records for one site in [[Great Britain|Britain]]. These records are continuous from January 1815. Irregular observations of rainfall, cloud cover, and temperature exist since 1767.<ref>

===Districts===

====The city centre====
The city centre is relatively small and is centred on [[Carfax, Oxford|Carfax]], a crossroads which forms the junction of [[Cornmarket Street, Oxford|Cornmarket Street]] (pedestrianised), [[Queen Street, Oxford|Queen Street]] (mainly [[pedestrianised]]), [[St Aldate's, Oxford|St Aldate's]] and the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]] ("the High"; blocked for through traffic). Cornmarket Street and Queen Street are home to Oxford's chain stores, as well as a small number of independent retailers, one of the longest established of which was [[Boswells of Oxford|Boswell's]], founded in 1738.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Boswells|url=http://www.boswells-online.co.uk//mall/infopageviewer.cfm/Boswells/AboutUs|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123112907/http://www.boswells-online.co.uk/mall/infopageviewer.cfm/Boswells/AboutUs|archive-date=23 November 2007|access-date=10 January 2010|publisher=Boswells-online.co.uk}}</ref> The store closed in 2020.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ffrench|first=Andrew|date=29 February 2020|title=Everything must go now at Boswells in closing down sale|newspaper=[[Oxford Mail]]|url=https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/18271030.everything-must-go-now-boswells-closing-sale/|url-status=live|access-date=29 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329215229/https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/18271030.everything-must-go-now-boswells-closing-sale/|archive-date=29 March 2020}}</ref> St Aldate's has few shops but several local government buildings, including the [[town hall]], the city police station and local council offices. The High (the word ''street'' is traditionally omitted) is the longest of the four streets and has a number of independent and high-end chain stores, but mostly university and college buildings. The historic buildings mean the area is often used by film and TV crews.

====Suburbs====
Aside from the city centre, there are several suburbs and neighbourhoods within the borders of the city of Oxford, including:

Oxford is at the centre of the [[Oxford Green Belt]], which is an [[environmental policy|environmental]] and [[Planning in the United Kingdom|planning]] policy that regulates the rural space in [[Oxfordshire]] surrounding the city, aiming to prevent [[urban sprawl]] and minimize convergence with nearby settlements.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Oxford Green Belt: Key Facts|url=http://www.cpreoxon.org.uk/campaigns/item/download/788|website=CPRE Oxfordshire|access-date=15 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215083708/http://www.cpreoxon.org.uk/campaigns/item/download/788|archive-date=15 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The policy has been blamed for the large rise in house prices in Oxford, making it the least affordable city in the United Kingdom outside of London, with [[estate agents]] calling for [[brownfield]] land inside the green belt to be released for new housing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/15133787.estate-agents-call-for-building-on-oxford-green-belt-to-ease-house-price-crisis/|title=Estate agents call for building on Green Belt to ease house price crisis|website=Oxford Mail|date=4 March 2017 |access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426220329/https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/15133787.estate-agents-call-for-building-on-oxford-green-belt-to-ease-house-price-crisis/ |first= Andy |last=Ffrench|archive-date=26 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/22/green-belt-housing-crisis-planning-policy|title=Loosen Britain's green belt.

==Governance==
{{main|Oxford City Council}}
[[File:Museum of Oxford (5652685943).jpg|thumb|[[Oxford Town Hall|Town Hall, St Aldate's]]]]
There are two tiers of local government covering Oxford, at district and county level: [[Oxford City Council]] and [[Oxfordshire County Council]]. From 1889 to 1974 the city of Oxford was a [[county borough]], independent from the county council.<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=act|act=Local Government Act 1972|year=1972|chapter=70|accessdate=25 April 2023}}</ref> Oxford City Council meets at the [[Oxford Town Hall|Town Hall]] on the street called [[St Aldate's, Oxford|St Aldate's]] in the city centre. The current building was completed in 1897, on a site which had been occupied by Oxford's [[guildhall]] since the 13th century.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1047153|desc=Town Hall, Municipal Buildings and Library|grade=II*|accessdate=25 April 2023}}</ref>

Most of Oxford is an [[unparished area]], but there are four [[civil parish]]es within the city's boundaries: [[Blackbird Leys]], [[Littlemore]], [[Old Marston]], and [[Risinghurst and Sandhills]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Parish council contact details |url=https://mycouncil.oxford.gov.uk/mgParishCouncilDetails.aspx |website=Oxford City Council |access-date=25 April 2023 |archive-date=25 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230525050356/https://mycouncil.oxford.gov.uk/mgParishCouncilDetails.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Economy==
Oxford's economy includes manufacturing, publishing and science-based industries as well as education, sports, entertainment, breweries, research and tourism.

===Car production===
Oxford has been an important centre of motor manufacturing since [[Morris Motors]] was established in the city in 1910. The principal production site for [[Mini (marque)|Mini]] cars, owned by [[BMW]] since 2000, is in the Oxford suburb of [[Cowley, Oxfordshire|Cowley]]. The plant, which survived the turbulent years of [[British Leyland]] in the 1970s and was threatened with closure in the early 1990s, also produced cars under the [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] and [[Rover Group|Rover]] brands following the demise of the Morris brand in 1984, although the last Morris-badged car was produced there in 1982.

===Publishing===
[[Oxford University Press]], a department of the [[Oxford University|University of Oxford]], is based in the city, although it no longer operates its own paper mill and printing house. The city is also home to the UK operations of [[Wiley-Blackwell]], [[Elsevier]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.publishers.org.uk/member/elsevier/ |title=Elsevier |publisher=The Publishers Association |access-date=23 June 2023 |archive-date=4 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210804121759/https://www.publishers.org.uk/member/elsevier/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and several smaller publishing houses.

===Science and technology===
The presence of the university has given rise to many science and technology based businesses, including [[Oxford Instruments]], [[Research Machines]] and [[Sophos]]. The university established [[Isis Innovation]] in 1987 to promote technology transfer. The [[Oxford Science Park]] was established in 1990, and the [[Begbroke Science Park]], owned by the university, lies north of the city. Oxford increasingly has a reputation for being a centre of digital innovation, as epitomized by Digital Oxford.<ref>{{cite web|title = Home – Digital Oxford|url = http://digitaloxford.com/|website = Digital Oxford|access-date = 3 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150509055659/http://digitaloxford.com/|archive-date = 9 May 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> Several startups including Passle,<ref>{{cite web|title = Passle – become a thought leader|url = http://passle.net|website = Passle: Don't have time to blog?|access-date = 3 June 2015|archive-date = 28 July 2020|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200728025406/https://home.passle.net/|url-status = live}}</ref> Brainomix,<ref>{{cite web|title = Brainomix|url = https://www.brainomix.com/|website = Brainomix|access-date = 5 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150708091626/https://www.brainomix.com/|archive-date = 8 July 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> Labstep,<ref>{{cite web|title = Labstep|url = https://angel.co/labstep|website = angel.co|access-date = 3 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150603230831/https://angel.co/labstep|archive-date = 3 June 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> and more, are based in Oxford.

===Education===

[[File:Wellington Square Oxford 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wellington Square, Oxford|Wellington Square]], the name of which has become synonymous with the university's central administration]]
The presence of the university has also led to Oxford becoming a centre for the education industry. Companies often draw their teaching staff from the pool of [[Oxford University]] students and graduates, and, especially for [[English as a Foreign or Second Language|EFL education]], use their Oxford location as a selling point.<ref>

===Brewing===
There is a long history of [[brewing]] in Oxford. Several of the colleges had private breweries, one of which, at [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose]], survived until 1889. In the 16th century brewing and [[malting]] appear to have been the most popular trades in the city. There were breweries in [[Brewer Street, Oxford|Brewer Street]] and [[Paradise Street, Oxford|Paradise Street]], near the [[Castle Mill Stream]]. The rapid expansion of Oxford and the development of its railway links after the 1840s facilitated expansion of the brewing trade.<ref name=Woolley78>{{cite journal |last1=Woolley |first1=Liz |year=2010 |title=Industrial Architecture in Oxford, 1870 to 1914 |journal=Oxoniensia |volume=LXXV |page=78 |publisher=[[Oxfordshire Architectural and Historical Society]] |issn=0308-5562}}</ref> As well as expanding the market for Oxford's brewers, railways enabled brewers further from the city to compete for a share of its market.<ref name=Woolley78/> By 1874 there were nine breweries in Oxford and 13 brewers' agents in Oxford shipping beer in from elsewhere.<ref name=Woolley78/> The nine breweries were: Flowers & Co in [[Cowley Road]], Hall's [[St Giles, Oxford|St Giles]] Brewery, Hall's Swan Brewery (see below), Hanley's City Brewery in [[Queen Street, Oxford|Queen Street]], Le Mills's Brewery in [[St. Ebbes]], [[Morrells Brewing Company|Morrell's]] Lion Brewery in [[Thomas the Apostle|St Thomas]] Street (see below), Simonds's Brewery in Queen Street, Weaving's Eagle Brewery (by 1869 the Eagle Steam Brewery) in [[Park End Street]] and Wootten and Cole's [[St Clement's, Oxford|St. Clement's]] Brewery.<ref name=Woolley78/>

The Swan's Nest Brewery, later the Swan Brewery, was established by the early 18th century in [[Paradise Street, Oxford|Paradise Street]], and in 1795 was acquired by William Hall.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Page |editor-first=William |editor-link=William Page (historian) |series=Victoria County History |title=A History of the County of Oxford, Volume 2: Industries: Malting and Brewing |year=1907 |publisher=[[Archibald Constable]] & Co |pages=225–277 |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=101945#s12 |access-date=5 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316074332/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=101945#s12 |archive-date=16 March 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[brewery]] became known as Hall's Oxford Brewery, which acquired other local breweries.

[[File:Oxford Parkway 3rd November2015 14.JPG|alt=|thumb|[[Oxford Parkway railway station|Oxford Parkway Station]], on the outskirts near [[Kidlington]]]]

[[Oxford railway station]] is half a mile (about 1&nbsp;km) west of the city centre. The station is served by [[CrossCountry]] services to [[Bournemouth railway station|Bournemouth]] and [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester Piccadilly]]; [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]] (who manage the station) services to [[Paddington railway station|London Paddington]], [[Banbury railway station|Banbury]] and [[Hereford railway station|Hereford]]; and [[Chiltern Railways]] services to [[Marylebone railway station|London Marylebone]]. Oxford has had three main railway stations. The first was opened at Grandpont in 1844,{{sfn|MacDermot|1927|pp=180–181}} but this was a terminus, inconvenient for routes to the north;{{sfn|MacDermot|1927|p=300}} it was replaced by the present station on [[Park End Street]] in 1852 with the opening of the [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham]] route.{{sfn|MacDermot|1927|p=327}} Another terminus, at [[Oxford Rewley Road railway station|Rewley Road]], was opened in 1851 to serve the [[Bletchley railway station|Bletchley]] route;{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|2005|loc=Historical Background}} this station closed in 1951.{{sfn|Mitchell|Smith|2005|loc=fig. 8}} There have also been a number of local railway stations, all of which are now closed. <!-- Several were provided in the earlier part of the twentieth century. (needs thinking about, do this bit later) --> A fourth station, {{rws|Oxford Parkway}}, is just outside the city, at the [[park and ride]] site near [[Kidlington]]. The present railway station opened in 1852.

Oxford is the junction for a short branch line to [[Bicester]], a remnant of the former [[Varsity line]] to [[Cambridge]]. This [[Oxford–Bicester line]] was upgraded to {{convert|100|mph|0|abbr=on}} running during an 18-month closure in 2014/2015 – and is scheduled to be extended to form the planned [[East West Rail]] line to Milton Keynes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eastwestrail.org.uk/ |title=Welcome to |publisher=East West Rail |date=18 August 2014 |access-date=23 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140807025346/http://www.eastwestrail.org.uk/ |archive-date=7 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> East West Rail is proposed to continue through {{rws|Bletchley}} (for {{rws|Milton Keynes Central}}) to [[Bedford railway station|Bedford]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eastwestrail.org.uk/western-section |title=Western Section |publisher=East West Rail |date=18 August 2014 |access-date=23 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140807030413/http://www.eastwestrail.org.uk/western-section |archive-date=7 August 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Cambridge,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eastwestrail.org.uk/central-section |title=Central Section |publisher=East West Rail |date=18 August 2014 |access-date=23 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140807032336/http://www.eastwestrail.org.uk/central-section |archive-date=7 August 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> and ultimately [[Ipswich railway station|Ipswich]] and [[Norwich railway station|Norwich]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eastwestrail.org.uk/eastern-section |title=Eastern Section |publisher=East West Rail |date=18 August 2014 |access-date=23 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140807025204/http://www.eastwestrail.org.uk/eastern-section |archive-date=7 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> thus providing alternative route to [[East Anglia]] without needing to travel via, and connect between, the [[London station group|London]] mainline terminals.

[[Chiltern Railways]] operates from Oxford to London Marylebone via {{rws|Bicester Village}}, having sponsored the building of about 400 metres of new track between Bicester Village and the [[Chiltern Main Line]] southwards in 2014. The route serves [[High Wycombe railway station|High Wycombe]] and London Marylebone, avoiding London Paddington and [[Didcot Parkway railway station|Didcot Parkway]].

In 1844, the [[Great Western Railway]] linked [[Oxford railway station|Oxford]] with [[Paddington railway station|London Paddington]] via {{stnlnk|Didcot}} and {{stnlnk|Reading}};{{sfn|Simpson|1997|p=59}}{{sfn|Simpson|2001|p=9}} in 1851, the [[London & North Western Railway]] opened its own route from Oxford to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]], via [[Bicester Village railway station|Bicester]], {{stnlnk|Bletchley}} and [[Watford Junction railway station|Watford]];{{sfn|Simpson|1997|p=101}} and in 1864 a third route, also to Paddington, running via {{stnlnk|Thame}}, {{stnlnk|High Wycombe}} and {{stnlnk|Maidenhead}}, was provided;{{sfn|Simpson|2001|p=57}} this was shortened in 1906 by the opening of a direct route between High Wycombe and London Paddington by way of {{stnlnk|Denham}}.{{sfn|MacDermot|1931|p=432}} The distance from Oxford to London was {{convert|78|mi|km|1}} via Bletchley; {{convert|63.5|mi|km|1}} via Didcot and Reading; {{convert|63.25|mi|km|1}} via Thame and Maidenhead;{{sfn|Cooke|1960|p=70}} and {{convert|55.75|mi|km|1}} via Denham.{{sfn|MacDermot|1931|p=432}}

Only the original ({{rws|Didcot}}) route is still in use for its full length, portions of the others remain. There were also routes to the north and west. The line to {{stnlnk|Banbury}} was opened in 1850,{{sfn|MacDermot|1927|p=300}} and was extended to [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill]] in 1852;{{sfn|MacDermot|1927|p=327}} a route to [[Worcester Shrub Hill railway station|Worcester]] opened in 1853.{{sfn|MacDermot|1927|p=498}} A branch to [[Witney railway station (goods)|Witney]] was opened in 1862,{{sfn|MacDermot|1927|p=551}} which was extended to {{stnlnk|Fairford}} in 1873.{{sfn|MacDermot|1931|p=27}} The line to Witney and Fairford closed in 1962, but the others remain open.

===River and canal===
Oxford was historically an important [[port]] on the [[River Thames]], with this section of the river being called the [[river Isis|Isis]]; the [[Oxford-Burcot Commission]] in the 17th century attempted to improve navigation to Oxford.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Thames Highway: Volume II Locks and Weirs |author=Thacker, Fred. S. |location= Newton Abbot |publisher=David and Charles |orig-year= 1920 |year=1968 }}</ref> [[Iffley Lock]] and [[Osney Lock]] lie within the bounds of the city. In the 18th century the [[Oxford Canal]] was built to connect Oxford with the [[Midlands]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Oxford Canal |first=Hugh J. |last=Compton |location=Newton Abbot |publisher=David & Charles |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-7153-7238-8 <!--not the correct OCLC number. Doesn't turn up anything as an LCCN either… |oclc=76-54077-->}}</ref> Commercial traffic has given way to recreational use of the river and canal. Oxford was the original base of [[Salters Steamers]] (founded in 1858), which was a leading racing-boatbuilder that played an important role in popularising pleasure [[boating]] on the Upper Thames. The firm runs a regular service from [[Folly Bridge]] downstream to [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]] and beyond.

===Roads===

[[File:M40 in Warwickshire Crop.jpg|thumb|The [[M40 motorway|M40]] extension]]

Oxford's central location on several transport routes means that it has long been a [[wikt:crossroads|crossroads]] city with many [[coaching inn]]s, although road traffic is now strongly discouraged, and largely prevented, from using the city centre. The [[Oxford Ring Road]] or A4142 (southern part) surrounds the city centre and close suburbs [[Marston, Oxfordshire|Marston]], [[Iffley]], [[Cowley, Oxford|Cowley]] and [[Headington]]; it consists of the [[A34 road (England)|A34]] to the west, a 330-yard section of the [[A44 road|A44]], the [[A40 road|A40]] north and north-east, A4142/[[A423 road|A423]] to the east. It is a [[dual carriageway]], except for a 330-yard section of the A40 where two residential [[service road]]s adjoin, and was completed in 1966.

====A roads====
The main roads to/from Oxford are:
* [[A34 road (England)|A34]] – a trunk route connecting the [[Northern England|North]] and [[Midlands]] to the port of [[Southampton]]. It leaves J9 of the [[M40 motorway|M40]] north of Oxford, passes west of Oxford to [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]] and [[Winchester]] to the south and joins the [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3]] {{convert|12.7|mi}} north of Southampton. Since the completion of the [[Newbury bypass]] in 1998, this section of the A34 has been an entirely [[grade separated]] [[dual carriageway]]. Historically the A34 led to [[Bicester]], [[Banbury]], [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], [[Birmingham]] and [[Manchester]], but since the completion of the M40 it disappears at J9 and re-emerges {{convert|50|mi|km}} north at [[Solihull]].
* [[A40 road (Great Britain)|A40]] – leading east dualled to J8 of the [[M40 motorway]], then an alternative route to [[High Wycombe]] and [[London]]; leading west part-dualled to [[Witney]] then bisecting [[Cheltenham]], [[Gloucester]], [[Monmouth]], [[Abergavenny]], passing [[Brecon]], [[Llandovery]], [[Carmarthen]] and [[Haverfordwest]] to reach [[Fishguard]].
* [[A44 road|A44]] – which begins in Oxford, leading past [[Evesham]] to [[Worcester, England|Worcester]], [[Hereford]] and [[Aberystwyth]].
* [[A420 road|A420]] – which also begins in Oxford and leads to [[Bristol]], passing [[Swindon]] and [[Chippenham]].

====Zero-emission zone====
{{main|zero-emission zone in Oxford}}
On 28 February 2022 a [[zero-emission]] pilot area became operational in Oxford city centre. Zero-emission vehicles can be used without incurring a charge but all petrol and diesel vehicles (including hybrids) incur a daily charge if they are driven in the zone between 7am and 7pm.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/residents/roads-and-transport/oxford-zero-emission-zone-zez/about-zero-emission-zone/ |title=About Oxford's Zero Emission Zone |access-date=30 April 2022 |archive-date=28 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220228130330/https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/residents/roads-and-transport/oxford-zero-emission-zone-zez/about-zero-emission-zone |url-status=live }}</ref>

A consultation on the introduction of a wider zero-emission zone is expected in the future, at a date to be confirmed.

====Bus gates====

Oxford has eight bus gates, short sections of road where only buses and other authorised vehicles can pass.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bus lanes and bus gates|url=https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/residents/roads-and-transport/parking/parking-and-bus-gate-fines/bus-lanes-and-bus-gates|publisher=Oxfordshire County Council|access-date=16 November 2022|archive-date=15 November 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221115143836/https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/residents/roads-and-transport/parking/parking-and-bus-gate-fines/bus-lanes-and-bus-gates|url-status=live}}</ref>

Six further bus gates are currently proposed. A council-led consultation on the traffic filters ended on 13 October 2022. On 29 November 2022, Oxfordshire County Council cabinet approved the introduction on a trial basis, for a minimum period of six months.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Colivicchi |first1=Anna |title=Plans for six traffic filters in Oxford approved by council |url=https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/23157606.plans-six-traffic-filters-oxford-approved-council/ |access-date=4 December 2022 |publisher=Oxford Mail |archive-date=4 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221204162608/https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/23157606.plans-six-traffic-filters-oxford-approved-council/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The trial will begin after improvement works to Oxford railway station are complete, which is expected to be by October 2024.<ref>{{cite web|title=Consultation on trial traffic filters 2022|url=https://letstalk.oxfordshire.gov.uk/traffic-filters-2022|access-date=6 December 2022|publisher=Oxford Mail|archive-date=5 December 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221205200909/https://letstalk.oxfordshire.gov.uk/traffic-filters-2022|url-status=live}}</ref> The additional bus gates have been controversial; Oxford University and Oxford Bus Company support the proposals but more than 3,700 people have signed an online petition opposing the new traffic filters for Marston Ferry Road and Hollow Way, and hotelier Jeremy Mogford has argued they would be a mistake.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Oxford University and Oxford Bus Company back traffic filters |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-63500562 |publisher=BBC News |date=4 November 2022 |access-date=16 November 2022 |archive-date=15 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221115143825/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-63500562 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Opinion: Why six new bus gates will be a mistake for Oxford says top hotelier |url=https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/23076506.six-new-bus-gates-will-mistake-oxford-says-top-hotelier/ |newspaper=Oxford Mail |first=Andrew |last=Ffrench |date=25 October 2022 |access-date=16 November 2022 |archive-date=15 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221115143827/https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/23076506.six-new-bus-gates-will-mistake-oxford-says-top-hotelier/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In November 2022, Mogford announced that his hospitality group The Oxford Collection had joined up with Oxford Business Action Group (OBAG), Oxford High Street Association (OHSA), ROX (Backing Oxford Business), Reconnecting Oxford, Jericho Traders, and Summertown traders to launch a legal challenge to the new bus gates.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Legal challenge to bus gates is 'last resort' says Jeremy Mogford |url=https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/23147823.legal-challenge-bus-gates-last-resort-says-jeremy-mogford/ |newspaper=Oxford Mail |first=Andrew |last=Ffrench |date=25 November 2022 |access-date=6 December 2022 |archive-date=6 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221206134003/https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/23147823.legal-challenge-bus-gates-last-resort-says-jeremy-mogford/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Motorway====
The city is served by the [[M40 motorway]], which connects [[London]] to [[Birmingham]]. The M40 approached Oxford in 1974, leading from London to [[Waterstock]], where the A40 continued to Oxford. When the M40 extension to Birmingham was completed in January 1991, it curved sharply north, and a mile of the old motorway became a spur. The M40 comes no closer than {{convert|6|mi|km|0}} away from the city centre, curving to pass to the east of [[Otmoor]]. The M40 meets the [[A34 road|A34]] to the north of Oxford.
