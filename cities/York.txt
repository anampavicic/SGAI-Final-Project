'''York''' is a [[cathedral city]] in [[North Yorkshire]], [[England]], with [[Roman Britain|Roman origins]], sited at the confluence of the rivers [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|Ouse]] and [[River Foss|Foss]]. It is the county town of [[Yorkshire]]. The city has many historic buildings and other structures, such as a [[York Minster|minster]], [[York Castle|castle]], and [[York city walls|city walls]]. It is the largest settlement and the administrative centre of the wider [[City of York]] district.

The city was founded under the name of [[Eboracum]] in 71 AD. It then became the capital of the Roman province of [[Britannia Inferior]], and later of the kingdoms of [[Deira]], [[Northumbria]], and [[Jórvík|Scandinavian York]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], it became the [[Province of York|northern England ecclesiastical province]]'s centre, and grew as a wool-trading centre.<ref name="timeline"/> In the 19th century, it became a major railway network hub and confectionery manufacturing centre. In the [[Second World War]], part of the [[Baedeker Blitz]] bombed the city. Although York was less targeted during the war than other, more industrialised northern cities, several historic buildings were gutted and restoration took place up until the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/9676910.when-sparks-flew-across-the-sky|title=When sparks flew across the sky|date=28 April 2012|work=The Press|publisher=Newsquest Media Group|access-date=20 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420182049/https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/9676910.when-sparks-flew-across-the-sky/|archive-date=20 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Historic governance of the city was as a [[county corporate]], not included in the [[Ridings of Yorkshire|county's riding system]]. The city has since been covered by a [[municipal borough]], [[county borough]], and since 1996 a [[non-metropolitan district]] (the City of York), which also includes surrounding villages and rural areas, and the town of [[Haxby]]. The current district's [[City of York Council|local council]] is responsible for providing all local services and facilities throughout this area. York's built-up area had a population of 141,685 at the [[2021 UK census]],<ref name="2021census"/> and the wider city (the local government district) had a population of 202,800, a 2.4% increase compared to the 2011 census.<ref>{{cite web |title=How the population changed in York, Census 2021 – ONS |url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/censuspopulationchange/E06000014/ |access-date=13 November 2022 |website=www.ons.gov.uk |language=en |archive-date=13 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221213193833/https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/censuspopulationchange/E06000014/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Toponymy==
The city's name is derived from [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] {{lang|cel|Eburākon}} "place of yew trees", from [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Celtic/eburos|eburos]] "[[Taxus baccata|yew tree]]" (compare [[Welsh language|Welsh]] {{lang|cy|efwr}}, [[Breton language|Breton]] {{lang|br|evor}}, "alder, buckthorn"; [[Old Irish]] {{lang|sga|ibar}}, [[Irish language|Irish]] {{lang|ga|iobhar}}, {{lang|ga|iubhar}}, {{lang|ga|iúr}}, [[Scottish Gaelic]] {{lang|gd|iubhar}}) + [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Celtic/-ākos|*-āko(n)]], a suffix of [[appurtenance]] meaning "belonging to", or "place of" (compare Welsh {{lang|cy|-og}}).<ref name="Xavier Delamarre 2003, p. 159">Xavier Delamarre, ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise'', éditions errance 2003, p. 159.</ref> However, {{lang|cel|Eburos}} ({{lang|grc|Eβουρος}}, {{lang|la|Eburus}}, {{lang|la|Eburius}}) was also a [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] personal name, so {{lang|cel|Eburākon}} could also mean "the property of Eburos".<ref>Pierre-Yves Lambert, ''La langue gauloise'', éditions errance 1994, p. 39.</ref><ref name="Xavier Delamarre 2003, p. 159"/> Indeed, the 12th‑century chronicler [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], in his fictional account of the prehistoric kings of Britain, {{lang|la|[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]}}, suggests the name derives from that of a pre-Roman city founded by the legendary king [[Ebraucus]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Geoffrey of Monmouth |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_the_Kings_of_Britain/Book_2#7 |title=Historia Regum Britanniae |year=1136 |access-date=9 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414000917/https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_the_Kings_of_Britain/Book_2#7 |archive-date=14 April 2016 |url-status=live |via=[[Wikisource]]}}</ref> 

The name was [[Latin (language)|Latinised]] by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] as {{lang|la|[[Eboracum]]}} or {{lang|la|Eburacum}}, and is called {{lang|gd|Eabhraig}} in Scottish Gaelic and {{lang|ga|Eabhrac}} in Irish, derived from the Latin name. The Latin {{lang|la|Eboracum}} became [[Angles (tribe)|Anglian]] {{lang|ang|Eoforwic}} in the 7th century: a compound of {{lang|ang|Eofor-}}, from the old name, and {{lang|ang|-wic}}, meaning "village", probably by conflation of the element {{lang|ang|Ebor-}} with a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] root {{lang|gem|*eburaz}} ('boar'); by the 7th century, the [[Old English]] for 'boar' had become {{lang|ang|eofor}}. When the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish]] army conquered the city in 866, the name was rendered in [[Old Norse]] as {{lang|non|Jórvík}}.<ref name="coyyh">{{cite web|url=http://www.york.gov.uk/leisure/Local_history_and_heritage/yorks_history/|title=York's history|publisher=City of York Council|date=20 December 2006|access-date=1 October 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031235552/http://www.york.gov.uk/leisure/Local_history_and_heritage/yorks_history/|archive-date=31 October 2007}}</ref>

The [[Old French]] and [[Norman language|Norman]] name of the city following the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] was recorded as {{lang|xno|Everwic}} (modern Norman {{lang|nrf|Évèroui}}) in works such as Wace's ''[[Roman de Rou]]'' and as ''Euruic'' in the [[Domesday Book]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wace|first1=Robert|title=Le Roman de Rou et des ducs de Normandie|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65499509/f362|website=BnF Gallica|access-date=15 September 2016|page=362|quote=Li Barunz de Everwic Schire (the barons of Yorkshire)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109065801/http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65499509/f362|archive-date=9 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Mills |first=A.

{{For timeline}}

===Early history===
[[File:Roman Fortifications in Museum Gardens York.jpg|thumb|Roman wall and the west corner tower of [[Eboracum]]. The top half is medieval.|200x200px]]

Archaeological evidence suggests that [[Mesolithic]] people settled in the region of York between 8000 and 7000 BC, although it is not known whether their settlements were permanent or temporary. By the time of the [[Roman conquest of Britain]], the area was occupied by a [[tribe]] known to the Romans as the [[Brigantes]]. The Brigantian tribal area initially became a Roman client state, but later its leaders became more hostile and the Roman [[Legio IX Hispana|Ninth Legion]] was sent north of the [[Humber]] into Brigantian territory.<ref name="Willis26">{{cite book|last=Willis|first=Ronald|year=1988|title=The illustrated portrait of York|edition=4th|publisher=Robert Hale Limited|isbn=0-7090-3468-7|pages=26–27}}</ref>

The city was founded in 71 AD, when the Ninth Legion conquered the Brigantes and constructed a wooden military [[castra|fortress]] on flat ground above the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]] close to its [[confluence]] with the [[River Foss]]. The fortress, whose walls were rebuilt in stone by the VI legion based there subsequent to the IX legion, covered an area of {{convert|50|acre|ha}} and was inhabited by 6,000 [[Roman legion|legion]]ary soldiers. The site of the ''principia'' (HQ) of the fortress lies under the foundations of [[York Minster]], and excavations in the undercroft have revealed part of the Roman structure and columns.<ref name="coyyh"/><ref name="ytss-2"/>

[[File:Constantine York.jpg|thumb|[[Statue of Constantine the Great, York|Roman Emperor Constantine the Great proclaimed Emperor at York in 306 AD]].|200x200px]]

The Emperors [[Hadrian]], [[Septimius Severus]], and [[Constantius I]] all held court in York during their various campaigns. During his stay 207–211 AD, the Emperor Severus proclaimed York capital of the province of Britannia Inferior, and it is likely that it was he who granted York the privileges of a '[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]' or city. Constantius I died in 306 AD during his stay in York, and his son [[Constantine the Great]] was proclaimed Emperor by the troops based in the fortress.<ref name="ytss-2">{{cite book|last1=Shannon|first1=John|last2=Tilbrook|first2=Richard|title=York – the second city|publisher=Jarrold Publishing|year=1990|isbn=0-7117-0507-0|page=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Lower (Britannia Inferior) and Upper Britain (Britannia Superior)|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/Classics/roman_provinces/britain/image21.htm|publisher=Vanderbilt University|access-date=24 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302180601/http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/Classics/roman_provinces/britain/image21.htm|archive-date=2 March 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> In 314 AD a bishop from York attended the [[Synod of Arles (314)|Council at Arles]] to represent Christians from the [[Roman province|province]].<ref>{{cite book|section=Before the Norman Conquest|title=A History of the County of York: the City of York|editor-first=P.

While the Roman ''colonia'' and [[castra|fortress]] were on high ground, by 400 AD the town was victim to occasional flooding from the Rivers Ouse and Foss, and the population reduced.<ref>{{cite book|last=Russo|first=Daniel G.|year=1998|title=Town Origins and Development in Early England, c. 400–950 A.D.|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|publication-date=1998|pages=119–120|isbn=978-0-313-30079-0}}</ref> York declined in the [[sub-Roman Britain|post-Roman]] era, and was taken and settled by the [[Angles (tribe)|Angles]] in the 5th century.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Barri|last2=Mattingly|first2=David|year=1990|title=An Atlas of Roman Britain|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|publication-date=2007|location=Cambridge|page=317|isbn=978-1-84217-067-0}} Cemeteries that are identifiably Anglian date from this period; some graves are within the Roman cemetery on The Mount.</ref>

In 866, Northumbria was in the midst of internecine struggles when the [[Vikings]] raided and captured York. As a thriving Anglo-Saxon metropolis and prosperous economic hub, York was a clear target for the Vikings. Led by [[Ivar the Boneless]] and [[Halfdan Ragnarsson|Halfdan]], Scandinavian forces attacked the town on All Saints' Day. Launching the assault on a holy day proved an effective tactical move – most of York's leaders were in the cathedral, leaving the town vulnerable to attack and unprepared for battle.

After it was conquered, the city was renamed from the Old English Eoforwic to [[Jorvik]]. It became the capital of Viking territory in Britain, and at its peak boasted more than 10,000 inhabitants. This was a population second only to London within Great Britain. Jorvik proved an important economic and trade centre for the Vikings. Norse coinage was created at the Jorvik mint, while archaeologists have found evidence of a variety of craft workshops around the town's central [[Coppergate]] area. These demonstrate that textile production, metalwork, carving, glasswork and jewellery-making were all practised in Jorvik. Materials from as far afield as the [[Persian Gulf]] have also been discovered, suggesting that the town was part of an international trading network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/anglo-saxon/key-viking-dates-lindisfarne-raid-danelaw-swein-forkbeard-harald-hardrada-stamford-bridge/|title=From the raid on Lindisfarne to Harald Hardrada's defeat: 8 Viking dates you need to know|access-date=16 June 2020|work=History Extra|publisher=BBC|archive-date=16 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200616222141/https://www.historyextra.com/period/anglo-saxon/key-viking-dates-lindisfarne-raid-danelaw-swein-forkbeard-harald-hardrada-stamford-bridge/|url-status=live}}</ref> Under Viking rule the city became a major river port, part of the extensive Viking trading routes throughout northern Europe.

===After the conquest===

In 1068, two years after the [[Norman conquest of England]], the people of York rebelled. Initially they succeeded, but upon the arrival of [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] the rebellion was put down. William at once built a wooden fortress on a motte. In 1069, after another rebellion, the king built another timbered castle across the River Ouse. These were destroyed in 1069 and rebuilt by William about the time of his ravaging Northumbria in what is called the "[[Harrying of the North]]" where he destroyed everything from York to Durham. The remains of the rebuilt castles, now in stone, are visible on either side of the River Ouse.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=York|volume=28|pages=927–929}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|section=The Old Baile|title=An Inventory of the Historical Monuments in City of York, Volume 2, the Defences |year=1972|pages=87–89|via=British History Online|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/rchme/york/vol2/pp87-89|access-date=16 June 2020|archive-date=27 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210227014309/https://www.british-history.ac.uk/rchme/york/vol2/pp87-89|url-status=live}}</ref>

The first stone minster church was badly damaged by fire in the uprising, and the Normans built a minster on a new site.

In the 12th century, York started to prosper. In 1190, [[York Castle#12th century|York Castle]] was the site of an infamous [[12th century English pogroms|massacre of its Jewish inhabitants]], in which at least 150 were murdered, although some authorities put the figure as high as 500.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofyork.org.uk/themes/norman/the-1190-massacre|title=The 1190 Massacre|publisher=York Museums Trust|work=History Of York|access-date=13 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103050430/http://www.historyofyork.org.uk/themes/norman/the-1190-massacre|archive-date=3 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="bbcpog">{{cite web |title=Death in York |publisher=BBC |date=28 September 2006 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/history/pogromyork_1.shtml |access-date=10 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214091034/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/history/pogromyork_1.shtml |archive-date=14 December 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>

York became a major cloth manufacturing and trading centre. [[Edward I]] further stimulated the city's economy by using the city as a base for his war in Scotland. The city was the location of significant unrest during the so-called [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381. The city acquired an increasing degree of autonomy from central government including the privileges granted by a charter of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] in 1396.

The city underwent a period of economic decline during [[Tudor period|Tudor]] times. Under [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]], the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] saw the end of York's many [[Monastery|monastic houses]], including several orders of [[friars]], the hospitals of St Nicholas and of St Leonard, the largest such institution in the north of England. This led to the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]], an uprising of northern Catholics in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire opposed to religious reform. Henry VIII restored his authority by establishing the [[Council of the North]] in York in the dissolved St Mary's Abbey. The city became a trading and service centre during this period.<ref name="coyad">{{cite web|title=The Age of Decline|publisher=City of York Council|url=http://www.york.gov.uk/leisure/Local_history_and_heritage/yorks_history/05_the_age_of_decline/|date=20 December 2006|access-date=5 October 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204082654/http://www.york.gov.uk/leisure/Local_history_and_heritage/yorks_history/05_the_age_of_decline/|archive-date=4 February 2008}}</ref><ref name="iadbpm"/> King Henry VIII spent a lot of time travelling around the country on official Royal Tours also known as ‘progresses’<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2023/research/new-light-on-royal-tours-of-iconic-king/ |website=York University |title=Research to shed new light on 'royal tours' of iconic King }}</ref> In the year 1541, Henry VIII and Catherine Howard visited the city of York on their royal tour.

In 1644, during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] [[Siege of York|besieged York]], and many medieval houses outside the city walls were lost. The [[barbican]] at Walmgate Bar was undermined and explosives laid, but the plot was discovered. On the arrival of [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]], with an army of 15,000 men, the siege was lifted. The Parliamentarians retreated some {{convert|6|mi|km|0}} from York with Rupert in pursuit, before turning on his army and soundly defeating it at the [[Battle of Marston Moor]]. Of Rupert's 15,000 troops, 4,000 were killed and 1,500 captured. The siege was renewed and the city surrendered to [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Sir Thomas Fairfax]]<ref name="coyad"/> on 15 July.

Following the [[English Restoration|restoration of the monarchy]] in 1660, and the removal of the garrison from York in 1688, the city was dominated by the gentry and merchants, although the clergy were still important. Competition from [[Leeds]] and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], together with silting of the River Ouse, resulted in York losing its pre-eminent position as a trading centre, but its role as the social and cultural centre for wealthy northerners was rising. York's many elegant [[townhouse]]s, such as the [[Mansion House, York|Lord Mayor's Mansion House]] and [[Fairfax House]] date from this period, as do the [[York Assembly Rooms|Assembly Rooms]], the [[Theatre Royal, York|Theatre Royal]], and the [[York Racecourse|racecourse]].<ref name="iadbpm">{{cite web |title=Post-medieval York |publisher=York Archaeological Trust |work=Secrets Beneath Your Feet |url=http://www.yorkarchaeology.co.uk/secrets/pmedieval.htm |access-date=18 July 2009 |year=1998 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517134912/http://www.yorkarchaeology.co.uk/secrets/pmedieval.htm |archive-date=17 May 2008}}</ref><ref name="coygt">{{cite web|title=Georgian York – social capital of the North|publisher=City of York Council|url=http://www.york.gov.uk/leisure/Local_history_and_heritage/yorks_history/07_georgian/|date=22 July 2008|access-date=5 October 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204082705/http://www.york.gov.uk/leisure/Local_history_and_heritage/yorks_history/07_georgian/|archive-date=4 February 2008}}</ref>

The railway promoter [[George Hudson]] was responsible for bringing the railway to York in 1839. Although Hudson's career as a railway entrepreneur ended in disgrace and bankruptcy, his promotion of York over Leeds, and of his own railway company (the [[York and North Midland Railway]]), helped establish York as a major railway centre by the late 19th century.<ref>Sources:

York is the traditional [[county town]] of [[Yorkshire]], and therefore did not form part of any of its [[Ridings of Yorkshire|three historic ridings]], or divisions.

===Ceremonial===
York is within the [[ceremonial county]] of [[North Yorkshire]] and, until 1974, was within the jurisdiction of the [[Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire|Lord Lieutenant of the County of York, West Riding and the County of The City of York]]. The city does retain the right to appoint its own Sheriff. The holder of the [[Royal Duke|Royal]] [[Duke of York|dukedom of York]] has no responsibilities either ceremonially or administratively as regards to the city.

York lies in the [[Vale of York]], a flat area of fertile arable land bordered by the [[Pennines]], the [[North York Moors]] and the [[Yorkshire Wolds]]. The city was built at the confluence of the Rivers Ouse and Foss on a terminal [[moraine]] left by the [[Last Glacial Period|last ice age]].<ref name="Hall-25">

[[File:River Foss (19380846674).jpg|thumb|The [[River Foss]]|200x200px]]

During Roman times, the land surrounding the Ouse and Foss was marshy, making the site easy to defend. The city is prone to flooding from the River Ouse, and has an extensive network of flood defences with walls along the river, and a liftable barrier across the Foss where it joins the Ouse at the "[[Bridges of York#The Blue Bridge|Blue Bridge]]". In October and November 2000, York experienced the worst flooding in 375 years; more than 300 homes were flooded.<ref name="dmcbflood">{{cite web |title=The impact of the October–November 2000 floods on contaminant metal dispersal in the River Swale catchment, North Yorkshire, UK |url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/iges/staff/Macklin%20files/HP%20Dennis%20et%20al.%202003.pdf |publisher=Wiley InterScience |year=2002 |last1=Dennis |first1=Ian A. |last2=Macklin |first2=Mark G. |last3=Coulthard |first3=Tom J. |last4=Brewer |first4 =Paul A. |page=1 |access-date=20 April 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071129111926/http://www.aber.ac.uk/iges/staff/Macklin%20files/HP%20Dennis%20et%20al.%202003.pdf |archive-date= 29 November 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In December 2015, the flooding was more extensive and caused major disruption.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/york-floods-hundreds-evacuated-and-swathes-of-historic-city-underwater-as-rivers-reach-record-levels-a6787271.html|title=York floods: Hundreds evacuated and swathes of historic city underwater as rivers reach record levels|work=The Independent|date=27 December 2015|access-date=19 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820215349/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/york-floods-hundreds-evacuated-and-swathes-of-historic-city-underwater-as-rivers-reach-record-levels-a6787271.html|archive-date=20 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The extreme impact led to a personal visit by Prime Minister [[David Cameron]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/weather/12071198/UK-floods-York-Leeds-Manchester-live-updates.html|title=Storm Frank: Jeremy Corbyn explains why he has only just turned up in the North – 'I didn't want to get in the way' – live|work=The Telegraph|date=31 December 2015|access-date=19 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151228104411/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/weather/12071198/UK-floods-York-Leeds-Manchester-live-updates.html|archive-date=28 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Much land in and around the city is on flood plains too flood-prone for development other than agriculture.

===Climate===
York has a [[Oceanic climate|temperate climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Cfb]]) with four distinct seasons. As with the rest of the Vale of York, the city's climate is drier and warmer than the rest of the [[Yorkshire and the Humber]] region. Owing to its lowland location, York is prone to frosts, fog, and cold winds during winter, spring, and very early summer.<ref>{{cite web|title=England Rural Development Programme: Appendix A3 – Yorkshire and The Humber Region – Section 1 Description Of Current Situation In The Yorkshire And The Humber Region|pages=2–3|url=http://www.hull.ac.uk/coastalobs/media/pdf/appendixa3.pdf|publisher=East Yorkshire Coastal Observatory|access-date=15 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606041951/http://www.hull.ac.uk/coastalobs/media/pdf/appendixa3.pdf|archive-date=6 June 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Snow can fall in winter from December onwards to as late as April but quickly melts.

Between 1773 and 1777, the Grand Jury House was replaced by John Carr's elegant Court House for the [[Assizes]] of the whole county.
{{anchor|Eye of York}} The Female Prison was built opposite and mirrors the court building positioned around a circular lawn which became known as the "Eye of the Ridings", or the "Eye of York".

1776 saw the last recorded instance of a wife hanged and burnt for poisoning her husband. [[Horse theft]] was a [[capital offence]]. The culprits of lesser crimes were brought to court by the city constables and would face a fine. The corporation employed a "common informer" whose task was to bring criminals to justice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofyork.org.uk/themes/georgian/the-county-court-house |title=The County Court House |publisher=York Museums Trust |access-date=30 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417050229/http://www.historyofyork.org.uk/themes/georgian/the-county-court-house |archive-date=17 April 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The former prison is now the [[York Castle Museum|Castle Museum]] but still contains the cells.

==Transport==
===Water===
York's location on the River Ouse, and in the centre of the Vale of York, means that it has always had a significant position in the nation's transport system.<ref name="VCH"/> The city grew up as a river port at the confluence of the Ouse and the Foss. The Ouse was originally a [[tidal river]], accessible to seagoing ships of the time. Today, both of these rivers remain navigable, although the Foss is only navigable for a short distance above the confluence. A [[Lock (water navigation)|lock]] at [[Naburn]] on the Ouse to the south of York means that the river in York is no longer tidal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canalrivertrust.org.uk/canals-and-rivers/river-ouse|title=River Ouse|publisher=Canal & River Trust|access-date=23 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908144027/http://canalrivertrust.org.uk/canals-and-rivers/river-ouse|archive-date=8 September 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Until the end of the 20th century, the Ouse was used by [[barge]]s to carry freight between York and the [[Port of Hull|port of]] [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. The last significant such traffic was the supply of [[newsprint]] to the local newspaper's Foss-side print works, which continued until 1997. Today, navigation is almost exclusively leisure-oriented.

===Roads===
[[File:Stonegate in York - geograph.org.uk - 1261035.jpg|thumb|Stonegate is pedestrianised during the day.|200x200px]]

Like most cities founded by the Romans, York is well served by long-distance trunk roads. The city lies at the intersection of the [[A19 road]] from [[Doncaster]] to [[Tyneside]], the [[A59 road]] from [[Liverpool]] to York, the [[A64 road]] from [[Leeds]] to [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] and the [[A1079 road]] from York to [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. The A64 road provides the principal link to the motorway network, linking York to both the [[A1(M) motorway|A1(M)]] and the [[M1 motorway]]s at a distance of about {{convert|10|mi|km|round=5}} from the city. The trans-Pennine [[M62 motorway]] is less than {{convert|20|mi|km|round=5}} away providing links to [[Manchester]] and Liverpool.
The city is surrounded on all sides by an outer ring road, at a distance of some {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} from the centre of the city, which allows through traffic to by-pass the city. The street plan of the historic core of the city dates from medieval times and is not suitable for modern traffic. As a consequence, many of the routes inside the city walls are designated as [[Pedestrian zone|car-free]] during business hours or restrict traffic entirely. To alleviate this situation, six bus-based [[York park and ride|park and ride]] sites operate in York. The sites are located towards the edge of the urban area, with easy access from the ring road and allow out of town visitors to complete their journey into the city centre by bus.<ref name="coypar">{{cite web|title=Park & Ride|publisher=City of York Council|url=http://www.york.gov.uk/transport/Parking/Park_and_Ride/|date=31 August 2007|access-date=9 October 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014003339/http://www.york.gov.uk/transport/Parking/Park_and_Ride/|archive-date=14 October 2007}}</ref>

The [[York Mystery Plays]] are performed in public at intervals, using texts based on the original medieval plays of this type that were performed by the guilds – often with specific connections to the subject matter of each play. (For instance the Shipwrights' Play is the ''Building of Noah's Ark'' and the fish-sellers and mariners the ''Landing of Noah's Ark'').<ref>J S Purvis, ''The York Cycle of Mystery Plays,'' London S.P.C.K. 1957 repr.1962</ref> The York Cycle of Mystery Plays or Pageants is the most complete in England.

The cycle was presented in the Theatre Royal in 1992 and 1996, within York Minster in 2000 and in 2002, 2006 and 2010 by Guild groups from wagons in the squares, in the [[Dean's Park]], or at the Eye of York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yorkmysteryplays.co.uk/|title=Guilds of York|access-date=26 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229062617/http://www.yorkmysteryplays.co.uk/|archive-date=29 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> They go around the streets, recreating the original productions.

[[File:Betty's Cafe Tea Rooms, York (geograph 407877).jpg|thumb|Bettys Café Tea Rooms|200x200px]]

In the centre of York, in [[St Helen's Square]], there is the York branch of [[Bettys and Taylors of Harrogate|Bettys Café]] Tea Rooms. Bettys' founder, Frederick Belmont, travelled on the maiden voyage of the ''[[RMS Queen Mary|Queen Mary]]'' in 1936. He was so impressed by the splendour of the ship that he employed the Queen Mary's designers and craftsmen to turn a dilapidated furniture store in York into an elegant café in St Helen's Square. A few years after Bettys opened in York war broke out, and the basement 'Bettys Bar' became a favourite haunt of the thousands of airmen stationed around York. 'Bettys Mirror', on which many of them engraved their signatures with a diamond pen, remains on display today as a tribute to them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bettys.co.uk/blog/bettys-mirror|title=Bettys Café Tea Rooms, York|publisher=Bettys & Taylors of Harrogate Limited|access-date=2 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203082848/https://www.bettys.co.uk/blog/bettys-mirror|archive-date=3 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>
