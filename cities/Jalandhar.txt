'''Jalandhar''' is a city in the state of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] in India. With a considerable population, it ranks as the [[List of cities in Punjab and Chandigarh by population|third most-populous city]] in the state and is the largest city in the [[Doaba]] region. Jalandhar lies alongside the historical [[Grand Trunk Road]] and is a well-connected junction for both rail and road networks.

The city is located {{cvt|148|km}} northwest of the state capital [[Chandigarh]], {{cvt|83.5|km}} southeast of the city of [[Amritsar]], and {{cvt|61.3|km}} north of [[Ludhiana]]. The national capital, [[Delhi]], is approximately {{cvt|381|km}}.

The [[National Highway 1 (India)|National Highway 1]] (NH1), crosses Jalandhar, further enhancing its connectivity.

==History==
[[File:Mughal Kos Minar.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kos Minar]] along [[Grand Trunk Road]] in Dakhini near Jalandhar, from [[Sher Shah Suri]] period]]
The history of Jalandhar District comprises three periods — ancient, medieval and modern.

=== Ancient ===
The city may be named after [[Jalandhara]], a [[Nath]] Guru who was from here.{{Citation needed|reason=Speculative|date=January 2022}} The city was founded by Devasya Verma as mentioned in the [[Vedas]]. Other possibilities include that it was the capital of the kingdom of [[Lava (Ramayana)|Lava]], son of [[Rama]] or that the name derives from the vernacular term ''Jalandhar'', meaning area inside the water, i.e., tract lying between the two rivers [[Sutlej|Satluj]] and [[Beas City|Beas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jalandhar.nic.in/origin.aspx|title=Welcome to Official Website of Jalandhar District, Punjab|access-date=8 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709023102/http://jalandhar.nic.in/origin.aspx|archive-date=9 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The whole of Punjab and the area of present Jalandhar District was part of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]]. [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-daro]] are the sites where remains of the [[Indus Valley civilisation]] have been found extensively. The archaeological explorations made during recent years have pushed the ancient times of Jalandhar District of the [[Harappa]] period. Jalandhar was known as [[Prasthala]] during the [[Vedic period]] and it was the capital of the [[Trigarta Kingdom]].<ref>Dinesh Prasad Saklani, Ancient Communities of the Himalaya, p.45</ref>

=== Medieval ===
Jalandhar and the [[Doaba]] may have been conquered around 1070 by the [[Ghaznavids]] during the reign of [[Ibrahim of Ghazni]].<ref>John Hutchison, Jean Philippe Vogel, History of the Panjab Hill States, Asian Educational Services, 1994 - Punjab Hill States (India), p.122</ref> The city was conquered by Raja [[Jasrat]] in 1431.<ref>{{Cite journal|author-link=K. S. Lal |last=Lal |first=K. S. |date=1958 |title=Jasrat Khokhar |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44145212 |journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress |volume=21 |pages=274–281 |jstor=44145212 |issn=2249-1937}}</ref> It later formed part of the province of [[Lahore]] during the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and [[Mughal Empire]]. The 18th century saw upheaval in Jalandhar amidst an anarchy caused by the disintegration of the Mughals and power struggles involving [[Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire|Persians]], [[Durrani Empire|Afghans]] and [[Sikhs]]. It was captured by the [[Singhpuria Misl|Faizullahpuria Misl]] in 1766, and in 1811 [[Maharaja Ranjit Singh]] incorporated it within the [[Sikh Empire]].<ref>Parminder Singh Grover Moga, Davinderjit Singh, Discover Punjab: Attractions of Punjab, Parminder Singh Grover, 20 May 2011</ref>

In 1849, following the annexation of the Punjab by the [[East India Company]], the city of Jalandhar, written in English as Jullundur by company officials, became the headquarters of the division and [[Jalandhar district|District]] of the same name. In 1858, company rule in India ended and the city became part of the [[British Raj]]. In the mid to late 19th century, the Punjab administration regarded Jullundur as too densely populated and farmed to capacity. This led to the district being a chief recruitment area for settlers to colonise the newly irrigated [[Punjab Canal Colonies]], in western Punjab.<ref>Tom G. Kessinger, University of California, Berkeley. Center for South and Southeast Asia Studies, Vilyatpur, 1848-1968: Social and Economic Change in a North Indian Village, University of California Press, 1 January 1974, p.16</ref>

=== Modern ===
The [[Khilafat Movement]] started in the district in the early 1920s to bring pressure on the government to change their policy towards [[Turkey]]. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] extended sympathy and support to this movement, however in response, the District was declared a 'Proclaimed Area' under the [[Seditious Meetings Act 1819|Seditious Meetings Act]]. In 1924, Pakistani general and military dictator [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] was born in the city.

Prior to the [[partition of India]], Muslims were in plurality in Jalandhar district. According to the 1941 census, [[Muslims]] made up 45.2% of the population, compared to [[Hindus]] and [[Sikhs]] being 27.6% and 26.5% respectively.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://www.punjabpartition.com/single-post/2018/11/18/1941-Punjab-Census-and-its-Interpretation|title=1941 Punjab Census and its Interpretation|date=18 November 2018}}</ref> Within a period of 10 years, from 1941 to 1951, the [[Muslims|Muslim]] population in Jalandhar district reduced from 45.2% to 0.2%.<ref name=":0" />

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
The city has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] with cool winters and long, hot summers. Summers last from April to June and winters from November to February. Temperatures in the summer vary from average highs of around {{convert|41|C|F|1|disp=or}} to average lows of around {{convert|25|C|F|disp=or}}. Winter temperatures have highs of {{convert|19|C|F|1|disp=or}} to lows of {{convert|6|C}}. The climate is dry, except during the brief southwest monsoon season during July and August. The average annual rainfall is about {{convert|70|cm|in|disp=or}}. In 2018, Jalandhar witnessed unusually heavy rainfall, with an over 20% increase from average rainfall levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bhaskar.com/punjab/jalandhar/news/heavy-rainfall-in-punjab-monsoon-news-5918894.html|title=Heavy Rainfall|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725153326/https://www.bhaskar.com/punjab/jalandhar/news/heavy-rainfall-in-punjab-monsoon-news-5918894.html|archive-date=25 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Since it is located in the northern plains, the area feels quite cold during winters and very hot during summers.

=== Rainfall ===
The city receives an average annual rainfall of approximately {{convert|700|mm|inch}}. However, fluctuations are not uncommon, as observed in 2018 when Jalandhar experienced a significant increase in precipitation. The city registered over a 20% increase from its average rainfall that year, which marked it as a year of heavy rainfall.

Despite the variations in climate across seasons, one thing remains constant: the extremity of temperatures, with winters feeling notably cold, and summers, feelings markedly hot due to Jalandhar's location in the northern plains.{{Weather box|location= Jalandhar
