== History ==
[[File:Shah-Jahan hunting lions at Burhanpur (July 1630).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Shah Jahan]] hunting wild [[Asiatic lion]]s in Burhanpur (July 1630)]]

=== Pre-Mughal period ===
Burhanpur was an important town under the [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty]] from 753–982. Excavations of the [[Tapti River]] and [[Asirgarh Fort]] have discovered many coins, goddess idols and temples from the prehistoric era. However, Burhanpur came to prominence during the medieval period.{{cn|date=July 2023}}

In 1388, Malik Nasir Khan, the [[Faruqi dynasty]] Sultan of [[Khandesh]], discovered Burhanpur, at the behest of [[Khwaja Zainuddin Shirazi|Shaikh Zainuddin]] and named it after a well-known medieval [[Sufi]] saint, [[Burhanuddin Gharib|Burhan-ud-Din]]. Burhanpur became the capital of the [[Khandesh]] sultanate. Later, Miran Adil Khan II (reigned 1457–1501), another sultan of this dynasty, built a citadel and a number of palaces in Burhanpur.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shyam |first=Radhey |year=1981 |title=The Kingdom of Khandesh |location=[[Delhi]] |publisher=Idarah-i-Adabiyat-i-Delli |page=21}}</ref> During his long reign, Burhanpur was transformed into a major centre for trade and textile production.{{cn|date=July 2023}}

=== Under the Mughals ===
In 1601, the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar]] annexed the Khandesh sultanate and Burhanpur became the capital of [[Khandesh subah]],<ref name="sen2">{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |pages=164}}</ref> one of three new top-level provinces in the [[Mughal empire]], added in 1601 (like [[Berar Subah]] in 1869 and Ahmadnagar subah in 1601–35) to the initial dozen as he conquered much of the Deccan.{{Citation needed|date=July 2021}} The town served as the residence of Khandesh's Mughal governor, [[Abdul Rahim Khan-i-Khanan]], during Akbar and Jahangir's rule. He constructed a new water supply for the town, as well as several gardens.<ref>{{Cite book|first1=George|last1=Michell|first2=Mark|last2=Zebrowski|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/231789599|title=Architecture and art of the Deccan Sultanates|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

[[File:Royal bath or hammam shahi qila Burhanpur.jpg|thumb|Royal bath or hammam Shahi qila Burhanpur|left]]
Many historical monuments survive in the area around Burhanpur, mainly dating from the rule of the great Mughal emperor [[Shah Jahan]]. Burhanpur was an important Mughal outpost. Shah Jahan spent a considerable amount of time in this town, and helped add to the [[Shahi Qila, Burhanpur|Shahi Qila]]. The Shahi Qila is one majestic palace in Burhanpur, located to the west of the Tapti River. Diwan-i-Aam and Diwan-i-Khas were built on the terrace of the Qila. Little of it remains today, as the Qila is mostly in ruins. However, the parts of the palace that are still standing display exquisite sculpture and carvings. The main attraction at the palace is the ''hamam'' or royal bath. It was specifically built for Shah Jahan's wife, [[Mumtaz Mahal]] so that she could enjoy a luxurious bath. It is said that she died there while giving birth to her fourteenth child. Even today, the ceiling has many intricate paintings.  One of these paintings depicts a monument which is said to have been the inspiration for the [[Taj Mahal]], her final resting place.<ref>[http://www.travelindia-guide.com/tour.../burhanpur-monuments.aspx] {{dead link|date=October 2018}}</ref> She was initially buried there for six months before being moved.  The original grave called the Aahukhana is in disrepair.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/in-neglected-burhanpur-where-mumtaz-mahal-once-rested/article17759131.ece|title=In neglected Burhanpur, where Mumtaz Mahal once rested|first=Rana|last=Safvi|date=2 April 2017|access-date=31 October 2018|newspaper=The Hindu}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=M. |first1=Ramakrishnan |last2=Nair |first2=Sanjeev |title=Video: Why Burhanpur, not Agra, was Shah Jahan's first choice for the Taj Mahal |url=https://scroll.in/video/856461/video-why-burhanpur-not-agra-was-shah-jahans-first-choice-for-the-taj-mahal |access-date=5 June 2023 |work=Scroll.in |date=3 November 2017}}</ref>

Around 1670 Daud Khan was the Subhadar (Governor) of Khandesh province, under the rule of [[Aurangzeb]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sarkar |first=Jadunath |title=Shivaji And His Times |year=1919 |location=London, England |pages=195 |language=en}}</ref>

=== Maratha conquest ===
In the 1720s, the town was taken by the Maratha [[Peshwa]] [[Bajirao]] during his expedition to Malwa and Delhi. In the 1750s, a Maratha army under [[Sadashivrao Bhau]], who defeated the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]], took control of the town. At the downfall of the Maratha Empire, the town was given to Maratha Sardar Holkar, Scindia, and then finally in 1818 was handed over to British by the Marathas.<ref name="Mehta2005">{{cite book |author=Jaswant Lal Mehta |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d1wUgKKzawoC&pg=PA212 |title=Advanced Study in the History of Modern India 1707-1813 |date=1 January 2005 |publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt.
