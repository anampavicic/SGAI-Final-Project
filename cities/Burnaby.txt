'''Burnaby''' is a city in the [[Lower Mainland]] region of [[British Columbia]], Canada. Located in the centre of the [[Burrard Peninsula]], it neighbours the City of [[Vancouver]] to the west, the [[District of North Vancouver]] across the confluence of the [[Burrard Inlet]] with its [[Indian Arm]] to the north, [[Port Moody]] and [[Coquitlam]] to the east, [[New Westminster]] and [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]] across the [[Fraser River]] to the southeast, and [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] on the [[Lulu Island]] to the southwest.

Burnaby was incorporated in 1892 and achieved its city status in 1992. A member [[list of municipalities in British Columbia|municipality]] of [[Metro Vancouver]], it is British Columbia's [[List of the largest municipalities in Canada by population|third-largest city]] by population (after Vancouver and Surrey), and is the [[seat of government|seat]] of Metro Vancouver's [[regional district]] government. 25% of Burnaby's land is designated as parks and open spaces, one of the highest in [[North America]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=GET OUTSIDE |url=https://tourismburnaby.com/explore/get-outside/ |website=tourismburnaby.com |access-date=June 13, 2022 |archive-date=May 21, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220521001811/https://tourismburnaby.com/explore/get-outside/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==History==

===Pre-colonial (before 1850)===
Early inhabitants were the ''[[hən̓q̓əmín̓əm̓]]'' and [[Sḵwx̱wú7mesh language|''Sḵwx̱wú7mesh'']] speaking Coast Salish Nations. Local landmarks such as Burnaby Mountain, Deer Lake, and Brunette River feature prominently in Indigenous history passed down through oral traditions.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |title=History of Burnaby: Resource Guide |url=https://www.burnabyvillagemuseum.ca/assets/Resources/History%20of%20Burnaby%20Resource%20Guide.pdf |url-status=live |access-date=June 24, 2020 |website=Burnaby Village Museum |publisher=Burnaby Village Museum |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210603211110/https://www.burnabyvillagemuseum.ca/assets/Resources/History%20of%20Burnaby%20Resource%20Guide.pdf |archive-date=June 3, 2021}}</ref> The northern shorelines of Burnaby, along the second narrows of Burrard Inlet was the site of an ancient battle between the attacking [[Laich-kwil-tach|Lekwiltok]] and the defending [[Musqueam Indian Band|Musqueam]] according to Chief Charlie Qiyəplenəxw.<ref name="auto"/>

The [[Coast Salish]] people living in BC and [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] numbered more than 100,000 people, a level of population density supported by agriculture in other geographies.<ref name="auto"/> Techniques to preserve and store surplus food sustained a hierarchical society. Burnaby's marshlands along its rivers and lakes were [[cranberry]] harvesting areas for numerous villages, some numbering over 1,000 residents.<ref name="auto"/> Indigenous people travelled through Burnaby to reach the mouth of Brunette and Fraser River for the bountiful fishing seasons, [[eulachon]] in the spring and [[sockeye salmon]] in the late summer. Early European explorers and [[North American fur trade|fur traders]] introduced diseases that decimated the Indigenous population. This false appearance of Burnaby as a vast open space, along with traditional Indigenous farming techniques which did not permanently alter the landscape, meant Indigenous land in Burnaby was mislabelled as [[terra nullius]].<ref name="auto"/>

===Incorporation (1850–1990)===

The [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]] of 1858, the first of many gold rushes in British Columbia, brought over 30,000 fortune seekers, including many American miners. The fear of an impending annexation by the United States led to the creation of the [[Colony of British Columbia (1858-1866)|Colony of British Columbia]] in 1858 and the establishment of [[New Westminster]] as its capital.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Marshall |first1=Daniel |title=Fraser River Gold Rush |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/fraser-river-gold-rush |website=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historica Canada |access-date=June 24, 2020 |archive-date=August 5, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200805083609/https://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/fraser-river-gold-rush |url-status=live }}</ref>

Settlers in Burnaby acquired land through a process called pre-emption which allowed people to claim a piece of land by clearing forests and building houses. Indigenous people were excluded from pre-emption. Royal Engineers dispossessed land from Indigenous people with the assistance of military force including the original routes of North Road, Kingsway, Canada Way, and Marine Drive. [[Logging]] permits given to settlers destroyed the forests of southern Burnaby which had provided vital sustenance for Indigenous people.<ref name="auto"/>

The City of Burnaby is named after Burnaby Lake, in turn named after [[Robert Burnaby]], who was a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], explorer, and legislator. He was previously private secretary to Colonel [[Richard Moody]], the first land commissioner for the Colony of British of Columbia.<ref>{{Cite bcgnis |id=2210 |title=Burnaby (city)}}</ref><ref name = Akrigg>{{Citation |last1=Akrigg |first1=G.P.V. |last2=Akrigg |first2=Helen B. |title=British Columbia Place Names |place=Vancouver |publisher=UBC Press |year=1986 |edition=3rd, 1997 |isbn=0-7748-0636-2 | url-access =registration |url=https://archive.org/details/britishcolumbiap0000akri_w1q9}}</ref> In 1859, Burnaby surveyed a freshwater lake in the city's geographic centre. Moody named it Burnaby Lake.

Burnaby was established in 1891 and incorporated a year later in 1892. In the same year, the interurban tram connecting [[Vancouver]], Burnaby, and [[New Westminster]] began construction.<ref name="auto"/>

=== Recent ===

The expanding urban centres of Vancouver and New Westminster influenced the growth of Burnaby. It developed as an agricultural area supplying nearby markets. Later, it evolved into an important transportation corridor between Vancouver, the [[Fraser Valley]] and the [[British Columbia Interior|Interior]]. The introduction of the Skytrain's Expo Line cemented this trend into the 21st century.

As Vancouver expanded and became a metropolis, Burnaby was one of the first-tier [[suburbs]] of Vancouver, along with [[North Vancouver (city)|North Vancouver]] and [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]]. During the suburbanization of Burnaby, "Mid-Century Vernacular" homes were built by the hundreds to satisfy demand by new residents. The establishment of British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) in 1960 and Simon Fraser University (SFU) in 1965 helped Burnaby gradually become more urban in character. In 1992, one hundred years after its incorporation, Burnaby officially became a city.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ireland |first1=Tom |title=The History of Burnaby, BC |url=https://604now.com/the-history-of-burnaby-bc/ |website=604 Now |date=April 20, 2017 |access-date=June 24, 2020 |archive-date=June 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200627113559/https://604now.com/the-history-of-burnaby-bc/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Since the 1970s, Burnaby has seen a decline in resource sectors and a subsequent rise of high value-added services and technology sectors. The presence of BCIT and SFU promoted research & development in the area. For example, manufacturing plants near Still Creek closed in the late 1970s, only to reopen few years later as film production studios.<ref name="auto"/> The continued expansion of media production in Burnaby contributed to [[Hollywood North]].

==Geography and land use==
[[File:RoyalOakBurnabyWinter2016.jpg|thumb|Central Burnaby, [[Capitol Hill, Burnaby|Capitol Hill]] and the [[North Shore Mountains|North Shore mountains]], as seen from [[Deer Lake (British Columbia)|Deer Lake Park]]]]

Burnaby occupies {{convert|96.6|sqkm}} and is located at the geographic centre of the [[Metro Vancouver Regional District]]. The city has four areas of urban density known as "town centres": Lougheed, Edmonds, [[Metrotown, Burnaby|Metrotown]], and Brentwood. The city's governmental and cultural precincts are located in Burnaby's Deer Lake area. Situated between the city of Vancouver on the west and [[Port Moody]], [[Coquitlam]], and [[New Westminster]] on the east, Burnaby is bounded by [[Burrard Inlet]] and the [[Fraser River]] on the north and south, respectively. Burnaby, Vancouver and New Westminster collectively occupy the major portion of the [[Burrard Peninsula]]. The elevation of Burnaby ranges from sea level to a maximum of {{convert|370|m|sigfig=4}} atop [[Burnaby Mountain]]. Due to its elevation, the city of Burnaby typically has more snowfall during the winter months than nearby Vancouver or Richmond. Overall, the physical landscape of Burnaby is one of hills, ridges, valleys and an alluvial plain.

Burnaby is home to many industrial and commercial firms. British Columbia's largest (and Canada's second largest) commercial shopping mall, [[Metropolis at Metrotown]], is located in Burnaby, as well as malls in [[Brentwood Town Centre|Brentwood]] and [[The City of Lougheed|Lougheed]] town centres. Still, Burnaby's ratio of park land to residents is one of the highest in North America. It also maintains some agricultural land, particularly along the Fraser foreshore flats in the Big Bend neighbourhood along its southern perimeter.

===Parks, rivers, and lakes===
Major parklands and waterways in Burnaby include [[Central Park (Burnaby)|Central Park]], [[Robert Burnaby Park]], [[Kensington Park (Burnaby)|Kensington Park]], [[Burnaby Mountain]], [[Still Creek]], the [[Brunette River]], [[Burnaby Lake Regional Park|Burnaby Lake]], [[Deer Lake (British Columbia)|Deer Lake]], [[Squint Lake]], and Barnet Marine Park.

===Climate===

Burnaby's Simon Fraser University weather station is located {{convert|365|m}} above sea level on Burnaby Mountain. Therefore, climate records are cooler and wetter, with more snowfall, as compared to the rest of the city.

Burnaby has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Cfb]]) with mild, dry summers and cool, rainy winters.

The [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] Operations Controls Centre 1, built in the 1980s, is responsible for the maintenance and operations of both the region's [[Expo Line (SkyTrain)|Expo Line]] and [[Millennium Line]]. In 2021, construction began on a $110 million Operations Controls Centre 2 to accommodate growing transit ridership.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/translink-new-skytrain-control-centre |title=TransLink to proceed with new $110 million SkyTrain control centre &#124; Urbanized |website=dailyhive.com |access-date=June 13, 2022 |archive-date=June 13, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220613011446/https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/translink-new-skytrain-control-centre |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Expo Line, completed in 1986, crosses the south along Kingsway. The Millennium Line, completed in 2002, follows [[Lougheed Highway]]. The SkyTrain has encouraged closer connections to [[New Westminster]], [[Vancouver]], and [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], as well as dense urban development at [[Lougheed Town Centre]] on the city's eastern border, at [[Brentwood Town Centre]] in the centre-west, [[Edmonds, Burnaby|Edmonds]]–Highgate in the southeast and, most notably, at [[Metrotown, Burnaby|Metrotown]] in the south.

Politically, Burnaby has maintained a left-wing city council closely affiliated with the provincial [[British Columbia New Democratic Party|NDP]] and school board for many years, while sometimes electing more conservative legislators provincially (from the [[British Columbia Social Credit Party|Social Credit]] and [[British Columbia Liberal Party|BC Liberal]] parties) and federally (from the [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform]], [[Canadian Alliance|Alliance]], and [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] parties). Its longest-serving politician had been [[Svend Robinson]] of the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP), Canada's first openly [[gay]] member of Parliament, but after 25 years and seven elections he resigned his post in early 2004 after stealing and then returning an expensive ring. Burnaby voters endorsed his assistant, [[Bill Siksay]], as his replacement in the [[2004 Canadian federal election]]. In the [[2013 British Columbia general election|May 2013 provincial election]], residents of the city sent 3 NDP MLAs and one Liberal MLA to the British Columbia legislature. The NDP MLA for [[Burnaby-Lougheed]], [[Jane Shin]], faced controversy after the election for misrepresenting herself as a physician despite not having completed a medical residency nor holding a licence to practice medicine.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moreau |first1=Jennifer |title=Newsmaker of the year: Jane Shin |url=http://www.burnabynow.com/news/newsmaker-of-the-year-jane-shin-1.771814 |website=Burnaby Now |publisher=Glacier Media |access-date=February 24, 2016 |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194151/http://www.burnabynow.com/news/newsmaker-of-the-year-jane-shin-1.771814 |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to a 2009 survey by ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine, Burnaby was Canada's best-run city. The survey looks at a city's efficiency, the cost of producing results, and the effectiveness of its city services.<ref>{{cite web |last=MacQueen |first=Ken |title=The best-run city in Canada: Lean, debt-free, and offering great public services, Burnaby is a model for the country |url=http://www.macleans.ca/2009/07/22/the-best-run-city-in-canada/ |access-date=August 4, 2009 |archive-date=July 27, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727063917/http://www2.macleans.ca/2009/07/22/the-best-run-city-in-canada/? |url-status=live }}</ref> However, Maclean's did note that Burnaby has one of the worst municipal voter turnouts in the country, at 26 percent. In 2015, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) included Burnaby as a Vancouver periphery to rank eighth for entrepreneurial communities.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Ted |last1=Mallett |first2=Simon |last2=Gaudreault |first3=Andreea |last3=Bourgeois |title=Entrepreneurial Communities, Canada's top places to start and grow businesses in 2015 |url=http://www.cfib-fcei.ca/cfib-documents/rr3370.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021132653/http://www.cfib-fcei.ca/cfib-documents/rr3370.pdf |archive-date=October 21, 2015 |date=October 2015}}</ref>
