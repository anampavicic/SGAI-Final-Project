== History ==

=== Origins ===
Tadesse Tamrat records that archeologists discovered "some remains of Christian settlements", dated to the late first millennium of the current era.<ref>Taddesse Tamrat, ''Church and State in Ethiopia'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972), p. 37 n. 4</ref>

=== 19th century ===
When the missionary [[Johann Ludwig Krapf]] was led as a prisoner from Adare Bille's capital to the Teledere House in April 1843 he had passed through Kombolcha, which he described as a village near the source of the [[Borkana River]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/journalsofrevmes00isen/journalsofrevmes00isen_djvu.txt ''Journals of the Rev. Messrs. Isenberg and Krapf, Missionaries of the Church Missionary Society, Detailing their proceedings in the kingdom of Shoa, and journeys in other parts of Abyssinia, in the years 1839, 1840, 1841 and 1842''], (London, 1843), p. 390</ref>

=== 20th century ===
Kombolcha was described during the [[Italian East Africa|Italian occupation]] as having postal and telephone service, a clinic, a general store, a barrack village of the A.A.S.S., as well as other improvements intended for Italians.<ref name="NAI-web">[https://nai.uu.se/library/resources/thematic-resources/local-history-of-ethiopia.html "Local History of Ethiopia"] The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 22 April 2022)</ref>

The city was used as a base by the [[United Nations]] relief organization and other humanitarian groups during the [[1984–1985 famine in Ethiopia|1984 famine]]. On 19 November 1989 the [[Tigrayan People's Liberation Front]] (TPLF) claimed to have captured Kombolcha. However, the highway from Kombolcha to [[Assab]] was not fully brought under TPLF control until the [[Derg]] was expelled from [[Tigray Province|Tigray]] later that year.<ref name=NAI-web/>

=== 21st century ===

An accord was signed between Ethiopia Bazra Motors and Russian company [[Ulyanovsk Automobile Plant]] on 30 April 2021, to set up a [[UAZ]] cars assembly plant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fanabc.com/english/ethiopian-russian-firms-agree-to-establish-vehicle-assembly-plant-in-kombolcha-town/|title = Ethiopian, Russian firms agree to establish vehicle assembly plant in Kombolcha town}}</ref>
