'''Navarre''' ({{IPAc-en|n|ə|ˈ|v|ɑr}} {{respell|nə|VAR}}; {{langx|es|Navarra}} {{IPA|es|naˈβara||Pronunciation_of_Navarre_in_Spanish.ogg}}; {{langx|eu|Nafarroa}} {{IPA|eu|nafaro.a|}}), officially the '''Chartered Community of Navarre''',{{efn|{{langx|es|Comunidad Foral de Navarra|links=no}} {{IPA|es|komuniˈðað foˈɾal de naˈβara|}}; {{langx|eu|Nafarroako Foru Komunitatea|links=no}} {{IPA|eu|nafaro.ako foɾu komunitate.a|}}.}} is a landlocked [[fuero|foral]] [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] and [[provinces of Spain|province]] in northern [[Spain]], bordering the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]], [[La Rioja]], and [[Aragon]] in Spain and [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] in [[France]]. The capital city is [[Pamplona]] ({{langx|eu|Iruña|links=no}}). The present-day province makes up the majority of the territory of the medieval [[Kingdom of Navarre]], a long-standing [[Pyrenees|Pyrenean]] kingdom that occupied lands on both sides of the western Pyrenees, with its northernmost part, [[Lower Navarre]], located in the southwest corner of France.

Navarre is in the transition zone between the green [[Cantabrian Coast]] and [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] interior areas and thus its landscapes vary widely across the region. Being in a transition zone also produces a highly variable climate, with summers that are a mix of cooler spells and heat waves, and winters that are mild for the latitude. Navarre is one of the [[Southern Basque Country|historic Basque provinces]]: its Basque features are conspicuous in the north, but virtually absent on the southern fringes. The best-known event in Navarre is the annual [[festival of San Fermín]] held in Pamplona in July.

== Toponymy ==

The first documented use of a name resembling ''Navarra'', ''Nafarroa'', or ''Naparroa'' is a reference to ''navarros'', in [[Eginhard]]'s early-9th-century chronicle of the feats of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charlemagne]], describing his intrusion to the Ebro river.<ref name="Auñamendi">[[Bernardo Estornés Lasa]]'s Spanish article on  [http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/96788 Navarra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112133908/http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/96788 |date=2012-01-12 }} in the [[Auñamendi Entziklopedia]] (click on "NAVARRA – NAFARROA (NOMBRE Y EMBLEMAS)")</ref> Other [[Royal Frankish Annals]] feature {{lang|es|nabarros}}. There are two proposed etymologies for the name.<ref name="Auñamendi"/>

* Basque ''nabar'' (declined [[Absolutive case|absolute]] [[Grammatical number|singular]] ''nabarra''): "brownish", "multicolour" (i. e. in contrast to the green mountainous lands north of the original County of Navarre).
* Basque ''naba'' (or Spanish ''nava''): "valley", "plain" + Basque ''herri'' ("people", "land").

The linguist [[Joan Coromines]] considers ''naba'' to be linguistically part of a wider [[Vasconic]] or [[Aquitanian language]] substrate, rather than Basque ''per se''.

The official name in Basque is ''{{lang|eu|Nafarroa}}'', but the form ''{{lang|eu|Nafarroa Garaia}} "Upper Navarre"'' is also often seen, to distinguish the province from neighboring [[Lower Navarre]].

== History ==

[[File:Coins of Arsaos in Navarre Spain 150BCE 100BCE Roman stylistic influence.jpg|thumb|210px|right|Coins of Arsaos, Navarre, 150 – 100&nbsp;BC, showing [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]'s stylistic influence]]
[[File:castillo javier.jpg|right|thumb|210px|[[Castle of Xabier]]]]

=== Antiquity ===

Before and during the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Vascones]] populated the southern slopes of the [[Pyrenees]], including the area which would ultimately become Navarre. In the mountainous north, the Vascones escaped large-scale Roman settlement, except for some coastal areas—for example [[Oiasso]] (in what is now [[Gipuzkoa]])—and the flatter areas to the south, [[Calahorra|Calagurris]] (in what is now La Rioja), which were amenable to [[Latifundium|large-scale Roman farming]]—vineyards, olives, and wheat crops. There is no evidence of battles fought or general hostility between Romans and Basques, as they had the same enemies.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kondaira.net/eng/Historia0005.html |title=HISTORY OF THE BASQUE COUNTRY - THE ROMANS |publisher=Kondaira.net }}</ref>

=== Kingdom of Navarre ===
{{Main|Kingdom of Navarre}}

Neither the [[Visigoths]] nor the [[Franks]] ever completely subjugated the area. The Vascones (to become the Basques) assimilated neighbouring tribes as of the 7th century AD. In the year&nbsp;778, the Basques defeated a Frankish army at the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]].

Following the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass (824)]], the Basque chieftain [[Íñigo Arista of Pamplona|Iñigo Arista]] was elected [[King of Pamplona]] supported by the [[muwallad]] [[Banu Qasi]] of [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]], establishing a Basque kingdom that was later called Navarre.<ref name="Collins1990">{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Roger|title=The Basques|year=1990|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=0631175652|edition=2nd }}, p. 140-141.</ref> That kingdom reached its zenith during the reign of [[Sancho&nbsp;III of Navarre|Sancho III]], comprising most of the Christian realms to the south of the Pyrenees, and even a short overlordship of [[Gascony]] (in the early 11th century).{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|p=181}}

When Sancho&nbsp;III died in 1035, the kingdom was divided between his sons.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kennedy|first1=Hugh|author-link=Hugh N. Kennedy|title=Muslim Spain and Portugal: A Political History of Al-Andalus|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317870418|page=150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NFfJAwAAQBAJ&q=kingdom+of+navarre+divided+1065}}</ref> It never fully recovered its political power, while its commercial importance increased as traders and pilgrims ([[Occitan language#Occitan in Spain|the ''Francs'']]) poured into the kingdom via the [[Way of Saint James]].{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|pp=214 – 215}} In 1200, Navarre lost the key [[Basque Autonomous Community|western Basque districts]] to [[Alphonse VIII of Castile]], leaving the kingdom landlocked.{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|pp=185}} Navarre then contributed with a small but symbolic force of 200 knights to the decisive [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] in 1212 against the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]].

The [[Jiménez dynasty|native line of kings]] came to an end in 1234; their heirs intermarried with French dynasties.{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|pp=232}} However, the Navarrese kept most of their strong [[Fueros of Navarre|laws and institutions]]. The death of [[Blanche I of Navarre|Queen Blanche I]] (1441) inaugurated a civil war period between the Beaumont and Agramont confederacies with the intervention of the Castilian-Aragonese [[House of Trastámara]] in Navarre's internal affairs.{{Sfnp|Monreal|Jimeno|2012|pp=10 – 15}} [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|In 1512, Navarre was invaded]] by [[Ferdinand the Catholic]]'s troops,<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Monreal |first1= Gregorio| last2= Jimeno | first2=Roldan|year = 2012 | title = Conquista e Incorporación de Navarra a Castilla| publisher = Pamiela | location=Pamplona-Iruña| isbn = 978-84-7681-736-0}}, pp. 30 – 32</ref> with [[Catherine of Navarre|Queen Catherine]] and [[John III of Navarre|King John III]] withdrawing [[Kingdom of Navarre#Independent Navarre north of the Pyrenees|to the north of the Pyrenees]], and establishing a Kingdom of Navarre-[[Viscounty of Béarn|Béarn]], led by [[Jeanne d'Albret|Queen Joan III]] as of 1555.

To the south of the Pyrenees, Navarre was annexed to the [[Crown of Castile]] in 1515, but kept a separate ambiguous status, and a shaky balance up to 1610—[[Henry IV of France|King Henry III]] was ready to march over Spanish Navarre. A Chartered Government was established (the ''Diputación''), and the kingdom managed to keep home rule. Tensions with the Spanish government came to a head as of 1794, when Spanish premier [[Manuel Godoy]] attempted to suppress Navarrese and Basque self-government altogether, with the end of the [[First Carlist War]] (1839 – 1841) definitely bringing the kingdom and its home rule (''fueros'') to an end.{{Sfnp|Collins|1990|p=275}}

==== Loss of home rule ====

After the 1839 [[Convention of Vergara|Convention of Bergara]], [http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Ley_de_Confirmaci%C3%B3n_de_Fueros a reduced version of home rule (''fueros'')] was passed in 1839. However, the 1841 [https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Ley_de_Modificaci%C3%B3n_de_fueros_de_Navarra_de_16_de_agosto_de_1841 Act for the Modification of Fueros] (later called the "Compromise Act", ''Ley Paccionada'') definitely made the kingdom into a province after a compromise was reached by the Spanish government with officials of the Provincial Council of Navarre. The relocation of customs from the Ebro river to the Pyrenees in 1841 prompted the collapse of Navarre's customary cross-Pyrenean trade and the rise of smuggling.

Amid instability in Spain, Carlists took over in [[Southern Basque Country|Navarre and the rest of the Basque provinces]]. An actual Basque state was established during the [[Third Carlist War]] with [[Estella-Lizarra|Estella]] as its capital (1872 – 1876), but King [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]]'s restoration in the throne of Spain and a counter-attack prompted the Carlist defeat. The end of the [[Third Carlist War]] saw [[End of Basque home rule in Spain|a renewed wave of Spanish centralisation]] directly affecting Navarre.

In 1893 – 1894 the ''[[Gamazada]]'' popular uprising took place centred in Pamplona against Madrid's governmental decisions breaching the 1841 chartered provisions. Except for a small faction (the so-called ''Alfonsinos''), all parties in Navarre agreed on the need for a new political framework based on home rule within the ''[[Laurak Bat]]'', the Basque districts in Spain. Among these, the [[Navarrese electoral Carlism (Restoration)|Carlists stood out]], who politically dominated the province, and resented an increased string of rulings and laws passed by Madrid, as well as left leaning influences. Unlike Biscay or Gipuzkoa, Navarre did not develop manufacturing during this period, remaining a basically rural economy.

==== Republic and military uprising ====

In 1932, a [[Southern Basque Country|Basque Country]]'s [http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Estatuto_General_del_Estado_Vasco_aprobado_en_la_Magna_Asamblea_de_Municipios_Vascos_celebrada_en_Estella_(Lizarra)_el_d%C3%ADa_14_de_Junio_de_1931 separate statute] failed to take off over disagreements on the centrality of Catholicism, a scene of political radicalisation ensued dividing the leftist and rightist forces during the [[2nd Spanish Republic]] (1931 – 1939). Thousands of landless labourers occupied properties of wealthy landowners in October 1933, leaving the latter eager for revenge.<ref>{{cite book | author=Paul Preston | title=The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain. | publisher= HarperCollins | location= London, UK | isbn=978-0-00-638695-7 | year=2013 | page=182}}</ref> The most reactionary and clerical Carlists came to prominence, ideologues such as [[Víctor Pradera Larumbe|Víctor Pradera]], and an understanding with [[General Mola]] paved the way to the Spanish Nationalist uprising in Pamplona (18 July 1936).

The triumphant military revolt was followed by a terror campaign in the rearguard against blacklisted individuals considered to be progressive ("reds"), mildly republican, or just inconvenient.<ref>Preston, P. 2013, p. 179-181</ref> The purge especially affected southern Navarre along the Ebro banks, and counted on the active complicity of the clergy, who adopted the fascist salute and even involved in murderous tasks.<ref>Preston, P. 2013, p. 182-184</ref><ref>{{cite video |date=2014-04-15 |title=Charla con Lucio Urtubia [Talks with Lucio Urtubia]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clRQxMj1H80 | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211102/clRQxMj1H80| archive-date=2021-11-02 | url-status=live|language=es |publisher=CGT/LKN Bizkaia|access-date=2015-05-01|time=07’02|quote=(First-hand witness [[Lucio Urtubia]]'s testimony in Spanish) For the first time ever that is being talked about now, I only bore witness to crimes and abuses in my land carried out by that Church that if it really wanted, all could have been prevented. In the Ribera of Navarre, there are about 4,000 dead by fire-squad, people who had done no harm, no evil to anyone, they were just workers, farmers, the hunger-stricken, so that is why, because they were Republicans, or just affiliated to the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] or [[Unión General de Trabajadores|UGT]] that they were executed by firearm. That was with the complicity of the Catholic Church, that is why I don't believe in that Church, that Church was horrific. That Church had the likes of don Pablo or don Vitoriano, who came down every morning, there were little kids who had just come from shooting in executions, with the former asking to them, "How many, how many today?", the kids going, "Three or four", in turn responding, "Small number, small number". I lived through all that.}}{{cbignore}}</ref> [[Victims of Civil War in Navarra|The killing]] took a death toll of at least 2,857, plus a further 305 dying in prisons (ill-treatment, malnutrition).<ref>Preston, P. 2013, p. 183</ref>

The dead were buried in mass graves or discarded into chasms abounding on the central hilly areas (Urbasa, etc.). Basque nationalists were also chased to a lesser extent, e.g. Fortunato Aguirre, a [[Basque Nationalist Party|Basque nationalist]] and mayor of Estella (and co-founder of [[Osasuna]] Football Club), was executed in September 1936. Humiliation and silence ensued for the survivors. Pamplona became the rebel launching point against the Republic during the [[War in the North]].

==== Post-war scene ====

As a reward for its support in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (Navarre sided for the most part with the military uprising), [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] allowed Navarre, as it happened with [[Álava]], to maintain during his dictatorship a number of prerogatives reminiscent of [[Fueros of Navarre|the ancient Navarrese liberties]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/97937/142976 |title=Navarra. Historia: Franquismo|author=<!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --> |website=Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia|publisher= EuskoMedia Fundazioa|access-date=16 September 2014}}</ref> The bleak post-war years were shaken by shortage, famine, and smuggling, with the economy relying on agriculture (wheat, vineyards, olive, barley), and a negative migration balance. The victors came to cluster around two main factions, [[Carlism#Spanish Civil War and Franco regime (1936–1975)|Carlists]] and [[FET y de las JONS|Falangists]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/97937/142976 |title=Navarra. Historia: Franquismo|author=<!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --> |website=Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia|publisher= EuskoMedia Fundazioa|access-date=16 September 2014}}</ref> while the totalitarian ultra-Catholic environment provided fertile grounds for another religious group, the [[Opus Dei]], to found their [[University of Navarra|University of Navarre]] (1952), ever more influential in Pamplona.

The coming of the society of consumption and incipient economic liberalisation saw also the establishment of factories and workshops during the early 1960s (automobile manufacturing and accessories, etc.), especially around the overgrown capital. It was followed by labour and political unrest.

==== Tension during the Spanish transition ====

Officials and figures with good connections to the Navarrese regional government went on to join [[Adolfo Suarez|Adolfo Suárez]]'s [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain)|UCD]], later splitting into the party [[Unión del Pueblo Navarro|UPN]] led by [[Jesús Aizpún Tuero]] (1979), refusing to join a democratic constitutional process on the grounds that Navarre's charters (or ''fueros'') remained in place. They also refused to join the [[Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country|Basque process]] to become an autonomous community, where recently legalised Basque nationalist and leftist parties held a majority.

A continuation of the institutional framework inherited from the dictatorship and its accommodation into the Spanish democracy was guaranteed by the Betterment ("Amejoramiento"), a Navarre-only solution considered 'an upgrade' of its former status issued from the (remains of the) charters. In a three-year span, the [[Socialist Party of Navarre|Spanish Socialists in Navarre]] veered in their position, quit the Basque process, and joined the arrangement adopted for Navarre (Chartered Community of Navarre, 1982). The reform was not ratified by referendum, as demanded by Basque nationalist and minority leftist forces.

== Politics ==

=== Institutions and status ===
[[File:Pamplona - Policia Foral de Navarra1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Patrol unit from the [[Policía Foral]], the Navarrese autonomous police force, that largely replaces the [[Policía Nacional (Spain)|Spanish National Police]] and the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] in this territory.]]
After the end of [[Francoist Spain|Franco's dictatorship]], Navarre became one of the 17 [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Autonomous Communities]] in Spain. The community ceremonies, education, and social services, together with housing, urban development, and environment protection policies are under the responsibility of Navarre's political institutions. As in the rest of the communities, Navarre has a [[Parliament of Navarre|Parliament]] elected every four years, and the majority in this Parliament determines the president of the Community, who is in charge of Navarre's government. Unlike most other autonomous communities of Spain (but like the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]]), Navarre has almost full responsibility for collecting and administering taxes which must follow the overall guidelines established by the Spanish government but may have some minor differences.

The first 3 presidents of the community belonged to the extinct [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain)|Union of the Democratic Centre]] (UCD) party. After 1984 the government was ruled by either the [[Socialist Party of Navarre]] (PSN – PSOE, one of the federative components of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]], main centre-left wing party in Spain) or the [[Navarrese People's Union]] (UPN) (a Navarrese party that had a long alliance with the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP), main right-wing party in Spain). However, in 2015 [[Uxue Barkos]] ([[Geroa Bai]]) became president with the support of [[EH Bildu]], [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] and [[Izquierda-Ezkerra]]. She is the first [[Basque nationalism|Basque nationalist]] president in Navarre.

[[Basque nationalism|Basque nationalist]] parties also represent a sizeable part of the vote (around 31% in the [[Navarrese regional election, 2015|2015 elections]]), and a majority in most of the northern areas. Basque nationalist parties have as a key point in their agendas to [[Southern Basque Country|merge Navarre into the Basque Autonomous Community]] by referendum (as predicted in the Spanish constitution). All Spain-based parties, as well as UPN and PSN, oppose this move.

=== Present-day political dynamics ===

Politics in Navarre have been marked by fierce rivalry between two blocs representing different national identities that are part of Navarre society: the Basque nationalist EH Bildu and pro-Basque Geroa Bai parties, on the one side, and the institutional pro-Spanish parties, UPN, PP and PSN on the other.

Since the establishment of Navarre's present status (the ''Amejoramiento'', the 'Betterment') in 1982, the successive regional governments ruled by UPN and PSN have been shaken by frequent political instability and [[Corruption in Navarre|corruption scandals]], with UPN's Miguel Sanz's term being the most stable and longest, extending from 2001 to 2011. Between 2012 and 2014, a series of corruption scandals broke out involving regional president [[Yolanda Barcina]] and other regional government officials that included influence peddling, embezzlement, misappropriation of funds and mismanagement leading to the [[Caja Navarra scandal|bankruptcy of Caja Navarra]].<ref>{{cite news|title=La Cámara de Comptos constata que el Gobierno hizo dejación de funciones al no controlar Caja Navarra |url=http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/2014/02/13/politica/navarra/la-camara-de-comptos-constata-que-el-gobierno-hizo-dejacion-de-funciones-al-no-controlar-caja-navarra |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140215090818/http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/2014/02/13/politica/navarra/la-camara-de-comptos-constata-que-el-gobierno-hizo-dejacion-de-funciones-al-no-controlar-caja-navarra |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 February 2014 |newspaper=Noticias de Navarra |date=13 February 2014 |access-date=14 February 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= Barcina y Sanz duplicaban la reuniones de Caja Navarra para cobrar más en dietas |url= http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20130307/54369078179/barcina-sanz-duplicaban-reuniones-caja-navarra-cobrar-mas-dietas.html|newspaper=La Vanguardia |date= 7 March 2013|access-date=14 February 2014}}</ref> By November 2012, the PSN—UPN's standing ally in Navarre up to that point—backed down on its support of UPN, but refused to impeach Yolanda Barcina or search new political alliances, leaving a deadlocked government.

Navarre consists of 272 [[List of municipalities in Navarre|municipalities]] and has a total population of 601,874 (2006), of whom approximately one-third live in the capital, [[Pamplona]] (195,769 pop.), and one-half in the capital's metropolitan area (315,988 pop.). There are no other large municipalities in the region. The next largest are [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]] (32,802), [[Barañain]] (22,401), [[Burlada – Burlata|Burlada/Burlata]] (18,388), [[Estella-Lizarra]] (13,892), [[Zizur Mayor]] (13,197), [[Tafalla]] (11,040), [[Villava – Atarrabia|Villava/Atarrabia]] (10,295), and [[Ansoáin – Antsoain|Ansoáin/Antsoain]] (9,952).

Despite its relatively small size, Navarre features stark contrasts in geography, from the [[Pyrenees]] mountain range that dominates the territory to the plains of the Ebro river valley in the south. The highest point in Navarre is [[Mesa de los Tres Reyes]], with an elevation of {{convert|2,428|m|ft|abbr=off}}.

Other important mountains are [[Txamantxoia]], [[Kartxela]], the [[Larra-Belagua Massif]], [[Sierra de Alaiz]], [[Untzueko Harria]], [[Sierra de Leyre]], [[Sierra del Perdón]], [[Montejurra]], [[Fort San Cristóbal (Spain)|Ezkaba]], [[Monte Ori]], [[Sierra de Codés]], [[Urbasa]], [[Andia]], and the [[Aralar Range]].

In the north, climate is affected by the Atlantic Ocean leading an Oceanic west coast climate (Köppen: Cfb). Since the northernmost part of Navarre is less than {{convert|10|km|mi}} from the [[Bay of Biscay]], the northern fringes resemble [[San Sebastián#Climate|San Sebastián]]. At central Navarre the summer precipitations start to lower, leading to a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa and Csb) At the southernmost part of Navarre the climate is cool semi-arid (Köppen: Bsk). This is also at a comparatively low elevation compared to most of the north, further pontentiating the hot summers in comparison to Pamplona and even more so the northern hilly and mountainous region.

The sole official weather station of Navarre is located in Pamplona in its north-western corner and has summer highs of {{convert|28|C|F}} and lows of {{convert|14|C|F}}, while winter highs are {{convert|9|C|F}} and lows {{convert|1|C|F}} with moderate precipitation year-round.

==Cultural heritage==
Navarre is a mixture of its [[Basque people|Basque]] tradition, the Trans-Pyrenean influx of people and ideas and [[Mediterranean]] influences coming from the [[Ebro]]. The [[Ebro]] valley is amenable to [[wheat]], [[vegetable]]s, [[wine]], and even [[olive tree]]s as in [[Aragon]] and [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]. It was a part of the [[Roman Empire]], inhabited by the [[Vascones]], later controlled on its southern fringes by the Muslim [[Banu Qasi]], whose authority was taken over by the [[taifa]] kingdom of [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]] in the 11th&nbsp;century.

During the [[Reconquista]], Navarre gained little ground at the expense of the Muslims, since its southern boundary had already been established by the time of the [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] in 1212. Starting in the 11th century, the [[Way of Saint James]] grew in importance. It brought pilgrims, traders and Christian soldiers from the north. [[Occitan language#Occitan in Spain|Gascons and Occitans]] from beyond the [[Pyrenees]] (called ''Franks'') received self-government and other privileges to foster settlement in Navarrese towns, and they brought their crafts, culture and [[Romance languages]].

Jews and Muslims were persecuted both north and south of Navarre, expelled for the most part during the late 15th century to the early 16th century. The kingdom struggled to maintain its separate identity in 14th and 15th centuries, and after [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand V]] forcibly conquered Navarre after the death of his wife Queen Isabella, he extended the Castilian expulsion and forcible integration orders applicable to {{transliteration|es|conversos}} and {{transliteration|es|mudejars}} of 1492 to the former kingdom. Therefore, [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]] in particular could no longer serve as a refuge after the Inquisitors were allowed.

== Economy ==
Navarre is one of the wealthiest regions in Spain per capita, with a diversified economy primarily focused on the [[energy sector]], [[healthcare]] services and [[manufacturing]]. The [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the autonomous community was 20.3 billion euros as of 2018, accounting for 1.7% of Spanish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 33,700 euros or 112% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 109% of the EU average.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|website=Eurostat}}</ref>

The unemployment rate stood at 10.2% in 2017 and was the lowest in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&init=1&language=de&pcode=tgs00010&plugin=1|title=Regional Unemployment by NUTS2 Region|website=Eurostat}}</ref>

Navarre leads Europe in its use of [[renewable energy]] technology and was planning to reach 100% renewable electricity generation by 2010. By 2004, 61% of the region's electricity was generated by renewable sources consisting of 43.6% from 28 [[wind farm]]s, 12% from over 100 small-scale [[water turbine]]s, and 5.3% from 2 [[biomass]] and 2 [[biogas]] plants. In addition, the region had what was then Spain's largest [[photovoltaic]] power plant at Montes de Cierzo de [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]] (1.2 MWp capacity) plus several hundred smaller photovoltaic installations.

== Demography ==
In 2018, the Foral Community of Navarra ranked 15th as the most populous Autonomous Community in Spain with a population of 647,554 inhabitants, which at the time was a population density of 62.32 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>.

The data of the population pyramid of 2010 can be summarized as follows:

* The population under 20 years of age is 19.84% of the total.
* The population between 20 and 40 years is 29.39%.

Presently, Spanish is predominantly spoken in most of the autonomous community, except for north-eastern areas, where Basque continues to be the prevailing language. According to official statistics, Spanish is the mother tongue of 81.9% of the population, Basque is 5.7% of the population's mother tongue, and 3.8% of the population has both languages as their mother tongue while 6.1% of the population have another language as their [[Mother-tongue|mother tongue]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.navarra.es/AppsExt/GN.InstitutoEstadistica.Web/informacionestadistica.aspx?R=1&E=3 |title=Información estadística |trans-title=Statistics of Navarra from 2011 Census |year=2011 |access-date=24 February 2020 |work=Instituto de Estadística de Navarra |publisher=[[Gobierno de Navarra]] |language=es |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222045532/http://www.navarra.es/AppsExt/GN.InstitutoEstadistica.Web/InformacionEstadistica.aspx?R=1&E=3 |archive-date=22 February 2015}}</ref>

Other languages have been spoken, but have disappeared, such as [[Navarro-Aragonese]], a Romance language that was spoken in the Middle Ages around the central part of the [[Ebro]] basin. Starting in the late 11th century, the influx of pilgrims and colonizers from Toulouse and surrounding areas (''Francs'') who settled in separate boroughs along the Way of Saint James rendered [[Occitan language|Occitan]] the status language of the kingdom up to early 14th century.

=== Linguistic division of the territory and legal consequences ===

[[File:Navarra - Zonificacion linguistica.png|thumb|Distribution by municipality of the Basque-speaking zone, mixed-speaking zone and the non-Basque speaking zone through the modification of 2017.]]
According to the 1978 Spanish constitution and the [[:es:Amejoramiento de Navarra|Amejoramiento del Fuero]], a Navarrese law establishing the basic institutional make-up of the chartered community of Navarre, Spanish is the official language of Navarre, while the [[Basque language]] is also the official language in Basque-Speaking areas. Unlike any other statutes in the Spanish autonomous communities owning a regional language, the Amejoramiento omits citing Basque as a specific language of its people or its consideration as part of the Navarrese heritage.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Vasconavarros |last=Esparza Zabalegi |first=Jose Mari |publisher=Txalaparta |year=2012 |isbn=9788415313-41-0 |location=Tafalla |pages=50–51}}</ref>

[[:es:Ley Foral del Euskera|The Statutory Law of Basque of 1986]] defined the above areas, creating the [[:es:Ley Foral del Euskera#Zona vascófona|''Basque-speaking zone'']], an area north-east of Navarre in which Basque is the co-official language along with Spanish. This law recognizes Spanish and Basque as Navarre's ''lenguas propias'' (a Spanish legal term meaning that a language in an autonomous community in Spain has co-official status along with Spanish),<ref>{{Cite book |title=Diccionario de la lengua española |edition=23rd |publisher=Real Academia Española y Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española |year=2014 |isbn=978-84-670-4189-7}}</ref> according to the Foral Law 18/1986 of Basque.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |url=http://www.lexnavarra.navarra.es/detalle.asp?r=1822 |title=LEY FORAL 18/1986, DE 15 DE DICIEMBRE DEL EUSKERA |trans-title=Foral Law 18/1986 |issue=154 |date=17 December 1986 |access-date=24 February 2020 |language=es}}</ref> This law divides Navarre into three linguistically distinct areas, a ''[[:es:Ley Foral del Euskera#Zona vascófona|Basque-speaking zone]]'', where Basque is the dominant language, a ''[[:es:Ley Foral del Euskera#Zona vascófona|Mixed-speaking zone]]'', where Basque and Spanish are both dominant, and a ''[[:es:Ley Foral del Euskera#Zona vascófona|Non-Basque speaking zone]]'', where Spanish is the dominant language. In the latter, the public entities of Navarre are required to use only Spanish, but in the mixed area the use of Basque is also confined to certain position. The area of the municipalities belonging to the Basque-speaking and Mixed Basque and Spanish-speaking zones are the following:<ref name=":0" />

Later, two more municipalities would be added that came from the Basque-speaking zone: [[:es:Lecumberri|Lecumberri]] and [[:es:Irurzun|Irurzun]].

* '''Mixed-speaking zone:''' [[Abárzuza]], [[Ansoáin]], [[Aoiz]], [[:es:Arce (Navarra)|Arce]], [[Atez]], [[Barañáin]], [[Burgui]], [[Burlada]], [[Ciriza]], [[Cendea de Cizur]], [[Echarri]], [[Echauri]], [[Valle de Egüés]], [[Ezcároz]], [[Esparza de Salazar]], [[Estella-Lizarra|Estella]], [[Ezcabarte]], [[Garde, Spain|Garde]], [[Goñi, Navarre|Goñi]], [[:es:Güesa|Güesa]], [[Guesálaz]], [[Huarte]], [[Isaba]], [[:es:Iza (Navarra)|Iza]], [[:es:Izalzu|Izalzu]], [[Jaurrieta]], [[Juslapeña]], [[Lezáun|Lezáu]], [[Lizoáin]], [[Ochagavía]], [[Odieta]], [[Oláibar]], [[Olza, Spain|Olza]], [[:es:Ollo (Navarra)|Ollo]], [[Oronz]], [[Oroz-Betelu]], [[Pamplona]], [[Puente la Reina]], [[Roncal – Erronkari|Roncal]], [[:es:Salinas de Oro|Salinas de Oro]], [[:es:Sarriés|Sarriés]], [[Urzainqui]], [[:es:Uztárroz|Uztárroz]], [[Vidángoz]], [[Vidaurreta]], [[Villava]], [[Yerri]], [[Zabalza]] and [[Zizur Mayor]].

As a consequence of the constitution of new municipalities, other municipalities would be added: [[Berrioplano]], [[Berriozar]], [[Orcoyen]] and [[Zizur Mayor]]. Moreover, in 2010 a legal modification granted four municipalities of [[Cuenca de Pamplona]] the power of incorporating into the ''Mixed-speaking zone'' if the absolute majority decided to be incorporated into the ''Mixed-speaking zone''. [[Aranguren]], [[Belascoáin]] and [[Galar, Spain|Galar]] decided to be incorporated into the ''Mixed-speaking zone'' while [[Noáin]] decided to remain in the ''Basque-speaking zone''.

One modification to the law implemented in June 2017 allowed municipalities from the ''Non-Basque speaking zone'' to become a part of the ''mixed zone 44'' ([[Abáigar]], [[:es:Adiós (Navarra)|Adiós]], [[Aibar]], [[Allín]], [[Améscoa Baja]], [[Ancín]], [[Añorbe]], [[Aranarache]], [[Arellano]], [[Artazu]], [[Bargota]], [[Beriáin]], [[Biurrun-Olcoz]], [[Cabredo]], [[Dicastillo]], [[Enériz]], [[Eulate]], [[:es:Gallués|Gallués]], [[Garínoain]], [[Izagaondoa]], [[Larraona]], [[Leoz]], [[Lerga]], [[:es:Lónguida|Lónguida]], [[Mendigorría]], [[Metauten]], [[Mirafuentes]], [[Murieta]], [[:es:Nazar (Navarra)|Nazar]], [[Obanos]], [[Olite]], [[Oteiza]], [[Pueyo, Navarre|Pueyo]], [[Sangüesa]], [[Tafalla]], [[:es:Tiebas|Tiebas]], [[Tirapu]], [[Unzué]], [[Ujué]], [[Urraúl Bajo]], [[:es:Urroz-Villa|Urroz-Villa]], [[Villatuerta]], [[Cirauqui]] and [[Zúñiga, Navarre|Zúñiga]]) and for [[Atez]] to pass from the ''Mixed-speaking zone'' to the ''Basque-speaking zone.''<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.naiz.eus/es/actualidad/noticia/20170622/44-localidades-navarras-ganan-derechos-para-el-euskara-al-pasar-a-la-zona-mixta |title=44 Navarran Localities Win Rights for Basque language through 'mixed zone' |date=22 June 2017 |access-date=24 February 2020 |work=Naiz |language=es}}</ref>

* '''Non-Basque-speaking zone:''' This zone is composed of the remaining municipalities that are located predominantly towards the Southeast of the foral community where the Basque language is not commonly spoken by the population. However, more people have been speaking Basque in these communities and in present day, there are municipalities in which 10% of their inhabitants are bilingual or semi-bilingual in Basque and Spanish such as in [[Tafalla]], [[Sangüesa]] and [[Lumbier]]. In comparison, in Tafalla or Sanguesa's population those that speak or understand Basque well are 5% of the population or 10% en [[Lumbier]]. In other localities with [[ikastola]]s such as in [[:es:Fontellas (Navarra)|Fontellas]], [[Lodosa]] and [[Viana, Spain|Viana]] the bilingual population is around 2% and 8%, while those that speak or understand Basque well are 1% in [[:es:Fontellas (Navarra)|Fontellas]], 2% in [[Lodosa]] and 5% in [[Viana, Spain|Viana]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cfnavarra.es/estadistica/confindex.asp?i=Informaci%F3n+Estad%EDstica&p=seleccion.asp&d=agregados/poblacion/censos_padrones/censo_2001/indice_infor_esta.asp?clase=pobmunicipio |work=Institute for Statistics of Navarra |title=Censo de poblacion.

=== Denomination of local entities ===

The official denomination of Navarran municipalities and villages are regulated according to the ''Foral Basque Law.''<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.navarra.es/home_es/Navarra/272+Municipios/Informacion.htm |work=[[Navarra.es]] |title=Información sobre el buscador de Entidades Locales |access-date=24 February 2020 |language=es}}</ref> It distinguishes three different types of formulas:

* '''Unique denominations:''' the use of Basque in legal documents is the same when compared with Spanish independently. Examples: Lantz or Beintza-Labaien.
* '''Compounded denominations:''' They have a unique denomination formula formed from the Spanish and Basque toponyms in Spanish or Basque and are united by the symbol "-" or "/". Its use (the compounded denomination) is the same in Spanish as in Basque. Examples: Doneztebe/Santesteban, Orreaga/Roncesvalles, Estella-Lizarra.
* '''Double denominations:''' The toponym, in Basque or Spanish is dependent on the language and how it is used in the text. Examples: Pamplona <> Iruña, Villava <> Atarrabia, Aibar <> Oibar.

[[File:Navarra - Mapa densidad euskera 2001.svg|thumb|Percentage of people that speak Basque well (2001).]]

=== Basque dialects in Navarre ===

Basque in Navarre has various dialects (there are nine according to the classification of the General Basque Dictionary or the [[:es:Real Academia de la Lengua Vasca|Royal Academy of the Basque Language]]). According to the most recent classification of [[:es:Koldo Zuazo|Koldo Zuazo]], the most widespread dialect is [[Upper Navarrese dialect|Upper Navarrese]], spoken in the northern part of Navarre. In localities such as Basaburua Mayor, Imoz and other localities bordering Gipuzkoa, the dialect of Central Basque is spoken and in the central part of the Pyrenees in Navarre a variety of [[Navarro-Lapurdian dialect|Navarro-Lapurdian]] is spoken.

On the east of the Pyrenees in Navarre, the [[Roncalese dialect|Roncalese]] and [[Salazarese dialect]]s of Basque used to be spoken in the valleys of [[Roncal Valley|Roncal]] and [[Salazar Valley|Salazar]], but they disappeared near the end of the twentieth century; the last person who spoke the Roncalese dialect died in 1991 and in Salazar the language also disappeared because the last person who spoke it fluently died during the first years of the twenty-first century. Apart from dialects, sub-dialects from Basque also exist and there are also differences in vocabulary in local linguistic communities.

=== Linguistic traits of the Spanish spoken in Navarre ===

There are a number of features of Spanish as spoken in Navarre that are either exclusive to the area or shared only with neighbouring areas (mainly [[Aragón]] and [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]), such as the predominance of the [[diminutive]] with ''-ico'' or the use of the conditional verb tense in place of the preterite of the subjunctive (for example, using ''podría'' instead of ''pudiera''). There are also differences in the vocabulary of Spanish speakers from Navarre,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Vocabulario navarro, Pamplona: Institución Príncipe de Viana, 1984 y Carmen Saralegui, Cristina Tabernero: Navarrismos en el diccionario de la Real Academia Española, Pamplona: Gobierno de Navarra, Departamento de Educación y Cultura, 2001|last=Irribaren|first=Jose María}}</ref> including the presence of words of Basque origin, which is in some cases due to a [[:es:Sustrato vasco en lenguas romances|Basque substrate]], or long-standing contact and commercial exchanges with areas of Navarre in which Basque is spoken.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucm.es/BUCM/revistas/fll/0212999x/articulos/RFRM0202110015A.PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070115205636/http://www.ucm.es/BUCM/revistas/fll/0212999x/articulos/RFRM0202110015A.PDF|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-01-15|title=Las fronteras de la lengua vasca a lo largo de la historia}}</ref>
