==Etymology==
[[File:An old photograph of Goddess Chamunda Mata's Temple on Dewas Tekri (Hill).jpg|thumb|An old photograph of Goddess Chamunda Mata's Temple on [[Dewas Tekri]] (Hill).]]
The name ''Dewas'' is derived from the Devi Vaishini hill in the city, commonly known as ''[[Dewas Tekri|Tekri]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.onlinedewas.com/ |title=Dewas : The Dream City - About Us |access-date=30 June 2016 |archive-date=19 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219002634/http://www.onlinedewas.com:80/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> The hill has a temple of the deities Devi [[Bhavani|Tulja Bhawani]], [[Chamunda]] Mata and [[Kali]]ka Mata. The word Dewas is believed to be a [[sandhi]] of the words [[Deva deity|Dev]] (deity) and Vas (abode in [[Marathi language|Marathi]]), so Dewas means ''house of the god''. [[Swami Shivom Tirtha]] wrote the history of the hill (''Tekri''&thinsp;) of Dewas in his book, ''Sadhan Shikhar''. Inspired by the area, [[E.M. Forster]] wrote ''[[The Hill of Devi]]'' in 1953.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cvJxAAAAMAAJ|title=The Hill of Devi|last=Forster|first=Edward Morgan|date=1 January 1953|publisher=Harcourt, Brace|isbn=9780156402651|language=en}}</ref>

The district takes its name from its headquarters town, Dewas, which is said to be derived from the legend that Dewas rests at the foot of a 300-foot (91 m) conical hill known as Chamunda hill on whose summit is the shrine of Goddess Chamunda. The image of the goddess is cut into the wall of a cave, known as Devi Vashini or the goddess's residence. From this, the name Dewas (''dev''-''vas'') seems to have been derived.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://dic.mp.nic.in/dewas/Dewas/html/geography.htm|title=Geography|website=dic.mp.nic.in|access-date=30 September 2016}}</ref>
