== History ==
Tottori is part of ancient [[Inaba Province]], and the place name "Tottori" can be found in the early [[Heian period]] [[Wamyō Ruijushō]]. [[Tottori Castle]] was completed in 1545 and the surrounding [[jōkamachi|castle town]] forms the core of the modern city. During the [[Edo period]], Tottori was the seat of a branch of the [[Ikeda clan]], which ruled [[Tottori Domain]]. Following the [[Meiji restoration]], Tottori was incorporated as a city on October 1, 1889, with the implementation of the modern municipalities system. 

Most of the downtown area was destroyed by the [[1943 Tottori earthquake|Tottori earthquake]] of September 10, 1943, which killed over 1000 people, and much of the rebuilt city was destroyed again in the Great Tottori Fire of April 17, 1952. In the 1950s, and again in 2004, redistricting ("[[Municipal mergers and dissolutions in Japan|gappei]]") of the city's borders increased its size to include a number of surrounding areas. On November 1, 2004, the town of [[Kokufu, Tottori|Kokufu]], the village of [[Fukube, Tottori|Fukube]] (both from [[Iwami District, Tottori|Iwami District]]), the towns of [[Aoya, Tottori|Aoya]], [[Ketaka, Tottori|Ketaka]] and [[Shikano, Tottori|Shikano]] (all from [[Ketaka District, Tottori|Ketaka District]]), the towns of [[Kawahara, Tottori|Kawahara]] and [[Mochigase, Tottori|Mochigase]] and the village of [[Saji, Tottori|Saji]] (all from [[Yazu District, Tottori|Yazu District]]) were merged into Tottori.<ref>{{Cite web |title=県内の市町村/とりネット/鳥取県公式サイト |url=https://www.pref.tottori.lg.jp/9577.htm |access-date=2024-02-07 |website=Tottori Prefecture Web Site |quote=平成16年11月1日に鳥取市、国府町、福部村、河原町、用瀬町、佐治村、気高町、鹿野町、青谷町は合併して鳥取市となりました。}}</ref> Ketaka District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

== Local attractions ==
=== Outline ===
The city's main street (Wakasa, or "young [[cherry blossom]]" street) runs north from the station and terminates at the foot of the Kyushouzan ("eternal pine") mountain. Around this mountain lies the oldest part of the city. Its centre is the now ruined [[Tottori Castle]], once the property of the [[Ikeda clan]] [[daimyō]] who ruled the [[Tottori Domain]] during the [[Edo period]]. It is open to the public, and is the site of the Castle Festival in autumn each year. In the vicinity are temples, museums, and public parks. The city also hosts the prefecturally famous [[Shan-shan festival]] in the summer, which features teams of people dressing up and dancing with large umbrellas; the name 'Shan-shan' is said to come from the sound made by the small bells and pieces of metal attached to the umbrellas, which are very large. An exceptionally big example of a Shan-shan umbrella graces the main foyer of Tottori Station.

At the beginning of every summer, Tottori is host to one of the biggest beach parties in the country, the San In Beach Party. The event lasts an entire weekend and some top names on the national DJ circuit are invited to perform.
