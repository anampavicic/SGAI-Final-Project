'''Rostov-on-Don'''{{efn|{{lang-ru|Ростов-на-Дону|Rostov-na-Donu}}, {{IPA|ru|rɐˈstof nə dɐˈnu|IPA}}}} is a port city and the [[administrative centre]] of [[Rostov Oblast]] and the [[Southern Federal District]] of [[Russia]]. It lies in the southeastern part of the [[East European Plain]] on the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]], {{convert|32|km|sp=us}} from the [[Sea of Azov]], directly north of the [[North Caucasus]]. The southwestern suburbs of the city lie above the Don [[river delta]]. Rostov-on-Don has a population of over one million people and is an important cultural, educational, economic and logistical centre of [[Southern Russia]].

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of Rostov-on-Don}}

===Early history===
From ancient times, the area around the mouth of the Don River has held cultural and commercial importance. Ancient indigenous inhabitants included the [[Scythians|Scythian]] and [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] tribes. It was the site of [[Tanais]], [[colonies in antiquity|an ancient Greek colony]], [[Gazaria (Genoese colonies)|Fort Tana]] under the [[Genoa|Genoese]], and [[Azov#Fortress of Azov|Fort Azak]] in the time of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

In 1749, a custom house was established on the [[Temernik|Temernik River]], a tributary of the Don, by edict of [[Elizabeth of Russia|the Empress Elizabeth]], the daughter of [[Peter the Great]],<ref name="gr">{{Cite book |title=Энциклопедия Города России |publisher=Большая Российская Энциклопедия |year=2003 |isbn=5-7107-7399-9 |location=Moscow |page=380}}</ref> in order to control trade with [[Turkey]]. It was co-located with a [[Fortress of Saint Dimitry of Rostov|fortress]] named for [[Dimitry of Rostov]], a [[metropolitan bishop]] of the old northern town of [[Rostov, Yaroslavl Oblast|Rostov the Great]]. [[Azov]], a town closer to the Sea of Azov on the Don, gradually lost its commercial importance in the region to the new fortress, but it remains an important historical center.<ref name="britannica">{{Cite web |title=Rostov-on-Don |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Rostov-on-Don |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190509192148/https://www.britannica.com/place/Rostov-on-Don |archive-date=May 9, 2019 |access-date=2020-01-29 |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica |language=ru}}</ref>

In 1756, the "Russian commercial and trading company of Constantinople" was founded at the "merchants' settlement" (Kupecheskaya Sloboda) on the high bank of the Don. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, with the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–74)|incorporation of previously Ottoman Black Sea territories]] into the [[History of Russia (1721–96)|Russian Empire]], the settlement lost much of its militarily strategic importance as a frontier post.<ref name=britannica/>

In 1796, the settlement was chartered and in 1797, it became the seat of [[Rostovsky Uyezd]] within [[Novorossiysk Governorate]].<ref name="gr" /> In 1806, it was officially renamed Rostov-on-Don.<ref name="gr" /> During the 19th century, due to its river connections with Russia's interior, Rostov developed into a major trade centre and communications hub. A [[railway]] connection with [[Kharkiv]] was completed in 1870, with further links following in 1871 to [[Voronezh]] and in 1875 to [[Vladikavkaz]].

Concurrent with improvements in communications, heavy industry developed. [[Coal]] from the [[Donets Basin]] and [[iron ore]] from [[Kryvyi Rih|Krivoy Rog]] supported the establishment of an [[iron foundry]] in 1846. In 1859, the production of [[Steam pump|pumps]] and [[boiler (power generation)|steam boilers]] began. Industrial growth was accompanied by a rapid increase in population, with 119,500 residents registered in Rostov by the end of the nineteenth century along with approximately 140&nbsp;industrial businesses. The harbour was one of the largest trade hubs in southern Russia, especially for the export of [[wheat]], [[timber]], and [[iron ore]].

In 1779, Rostov-on-Don became associated with a settlement of [[Armenia]]n refugees from [[Crimea]] at [[Nakhichevan-on-Don]]. The two settlements were separated by a field of wheat. In 1928, the two towns were merged. The former town border lies beneath the Teatralnaya Square of central Rostov-on-Don. By 1928, following the incorporation of the hitherto neighbouring city of Nakhichevan-on-Don, Rostov had become the third-largest city in Russia.

In the early 20th century, epidemics of [[cholera]] during the summer months were not uncommon.

===20th century===
During [[World War I]] Rostov-on-Don was briefly [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk#Territorial cessions in eastern Europe|occupied]] by the [[German Empire]] in 1918.

During the [[Russian Civil War]], the [[White movement|Whites]] and the [[Red Army|Reds]] contested Rostov-on-Don, then the most heavily industrialized city of South Russia. By 1928, the regional government had moved from the old [[Cossacks|Cossack]] capital of [[Novocherkassk]] to Rostov-on-Don.

In the Soviet years, the [[Bolshevik]]s demolished two of Rostov-on-Don's principal landmarks: St.&nbsp;Alexander Nevsky Cathedral (1908) and St.&nbsp;George Cathedral (1783–1807).

During [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] forces occupied Rostov-on-Don, at first from 19/20 November to 2 December 1941,<ref>[[Antony Beevor]], ''Stalingrad'' (1998) Viking Press {{ISBN|9780670870950}}</ref> after attacks by the German [[First Panzer Army]] in the [[Battle of Rostov (1941)|Battle of Rostov]], and then for seven months from 24 July 1942 to 14 February 1943. The town was of strategic importance as a railway junction and a river port accessing the [[Caucasus]], a region rich in oil and minerals. It took ten years to restore the city from the damage during World War II.

In 1942 up to 30,000 Russian Jews were massacred by the German military in Rostov-on-Don at a site called [[Zmievskaya Balka]].

=== 21st century ===
On 19 March 2016, [[Flydubai Flight 981]], a [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-800]] operating from Dubai to Rostov-on-Don in Russia, crashed during a [[go-around]] in inclement weather at [[Rostov-on-Don Airport]], killing all 62 people (55 passengers and 7 crew) on board.

Rostov-on-Don hosted several matches of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

Rostov-on-Don is the location of the Russian [[Southern Military District]], which includes the [[58th Combined Arms Army]]. As such, it was a key logistical hub during the 2022 [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]] and the [[2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Michael N. |first1=Schmitt |title=Was Russia at War with the Wagner Group? |url=https://lieber.westpoint.edu/was-russia-war-wagner-group/ |work=Articles of War |publisher=Lieber Institute, West Point |date=16 June 2023}}</ref>

[[Albert Parry (academic)|Albert Parry]], born in 1901 in Rostov-on-Don, wrote of the summers of his childhood:
:There were sultry days of brassy sun, but also cool evenings on the balconies facing the Don River, with the soft glow of charcoal in the [[samovar]], with the ripe cherries crushed by your spoon against the bottom and sides of your glass of scalding tea.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2006-03-09 |title=Rostov-on-Don.

==Symbols==
[[File:Coat of Arms of Rostov-on-Don.svg|thumb|Coat of arms of Rostov-on-Don]]

In December 1996, Rostov-on-Don adopted a coat of arms, a flag and a mayoral decoration as the symbols of the town. The first coat of arms of Rostov-on-Don was designed in 1811 and approved by the Tsar. In 1904, some changes were made. One lasting oil painting of the coat-of-arms is kept in the regional local history museum but its accuracy and authenticity are uncertain. In June 1996, the Rostov-on-Don [[City Duma]] adopted a variant of the coat-of-arms in which a tower represents the St.&nbsp;Dimitry Rostovsky Fortress. The ancient Russian arms reference the role Rostov played in the defense of Russia's borders. The coat-of-arms adorns the mayor's decoration but all other cases of its use are first considered for approval by the City Duma.

===Flag===
[[File:Rnd flag.svg|thumb|right|Flag of Rostov-on-Don]]

The flag of Rostov-on-Don was approved by the Duma on September&nbsp;20, 1864. At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries the home guard regiments, which defended the Southern borders of Russia, were raised under this flag.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The "Flag of Rostov" is kept in the town's municipal building under glass. Its length is {{convert|1370|mm|sp=us}} and width, {{convert|850|mm|sp=us}}. The flag is taken out of the building only on [[Victory Day (May 9)|Victory Day]] and Rostov-on-Don Day by a guard of honour.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In 1870, an oval-shaped mayoral decoration wrought from precious or semi-precious white metal was introduced. On the front is written "Rostov-on-Don" at the top, the Rostov-on-Don coat-of-arms is in the center and the inscription, "Mayor of the City" is written at the bottom. On its reverse side, the day of its adoption, April&nbsp;9, 1996, is recorded. The decoration is worn over the suit on a large chain. The mayor returns the decoration to the Duma on his or her retirement from office.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The Emblem of the [[Don Cossacks|Don Host Oblast]] was introduced in July&nbsp;5 (18), 1878. The flag of the All Great Don Army was introduced in May 1918 on the "Circle of the Don Saving".{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Public transport in Rostov-on-Don includes buses, trolleybuses, trams, and ''[[marshrutka]]s'' (routed minibus, usually a 17-passenger Mercedes Sprinter). The [[Rostov Metro]] was planned in the early 1990s and later in the 2000s and 2010s. At the end of 2021, the Government of the Rostov Region and the Sinara company signed an agreement on the creation of a high-speed tramway in Rostov-on-Don on a concession basis. This happened at the international forum Transport Week 2021 in Moscow.
