==Economy==
===Industry===
Industrialisation started in the Halisahar area in the early years of the twentieth century with the setting up of jute mills and pulp and paper mills on the banks of the Hooghly river. The fortunes of the jute industry have declined but two mills are still functional in Halisahar. Naihati Jute Mills set up its first factory at Hazinagar in 1905. It was taken over by the Bhagat family in 1958. J.K. Bhagat has been at the helm of affairs for the last 45 years. Hukumchand Jute Mill was established at Hazinagar in 1919 and is still functioning.<ref name=admin/><ref>{{cite web | url =  http://myhalisahar.blogspot.com/ | title =  Hlisahar… my beautiful home town| publisher =  My Halisahar | access-date =  25 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/clashes-in-north-24-parganas-bjp-report-blames-outsider-muslims-councillor-points-to-ailing-economy-3093881/  | title = Clashes in North 24 Parganas | date = 21 October 2016 | publisher = The Indian Express, 21 October 2016  | access-date =  25 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.indiamart.com/the-naihati-jute-mills/aboutus.html  | title = The Naihati Jute Mills Co.| publisher = Indiamart  | access-date =  25 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.zaubacorp.com/company/THE-NAIHATI-JUTE-MILLS-CO-LTD/U17119WB1905PLC001612  | title =  The Naihati Jute Mill Co.
