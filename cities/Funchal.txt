'''Funchal''' ({{IPA|pt|fũˈʃal|-|Pt-pt Funchal FF.ogg}}) is the capital, largest city and the municipal seat of [[Portugal]]'s [[Madeira|Autonomous Region of Madeira]], bordered by the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The city has a population of 105,795,<ref name=":0" /> making it the sixth largest city in Portugal. Because of its high cultural and historical value, Funchal is one of Portugal's main tourist attractions; it is also popular as a destination for [[New Year's Eve]], and it is the leading Portuguese port on [[cruise liner]] dockings.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url=http://pianc-jp.org/news/images/19_e_l_o_2013MedDays_PIANC_Brogueira_long.pdf |title=Cruise tourism in Portugal {{!}} PIANC Mediterranean Days |access-date=10 April 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112152747/http://pianc-jp.org/news/images/19_e_l_o_2013MedDays_PIANC_Brogueira_long.pdf |archive-date=12 January 2015  }}</ref>

==Etymology==
The first settlers named their settlement Funchal after the abundant wild [[fennel]] that grew there. The name is formed from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word for fennel, ''funcho,'' and the suffix ''-al'', to denote "a plantation of fennel":<ref>{{citation |author1=Frutuoso, G. |author2=de Azevedo, A.R. |year=1873 |title=As Saudades da terra |publisher=Typ. funchalense |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KIsDAAAAYAAJ |page=39 |language=pt }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Funchal.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Funchal}}
[[File:Funchal ( Portugal )11.jpg|thumb|left|215px|[[Cathedral of Funchal]] (Sé Cathedral), constructed under the orders of D. Manuel, Duke of Beja, dating back to the 15th century]]
{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2022}}
This settlement began around 1424, when the island was divided into two ''[[Captaincy|captaincies]].'' The zones that would become the urbanized core of Funchal were founded by [[João Gonçalves Zarco]] who settled there with members of his family. Owing to its geographic location, the site became an important maritime port and its productive soils attracted new settlers.{{cn|date=November 2022}} Its coastal position, the most productive on the island, quickly permitted Funchal to develop an urban core and surpass the populations of other settlements.

In the early 15th century, [[Álvaro Fernandes]] became the commander of Funchal.

As part of its administrative role, the settlement received its primary lighthouse between 1452 and 1454, when it was elevated to the status of ''vila'' and municipal seat. Funchal became an important transfer point for European commercial interests. [[Christopher Columbus]] was one of the early settlers, but later many of the merchant families established commercial interests on the island, including: João d'Esmenaut from the [[Picardy (region)|Picardy region]], the Lomelino from [[Genoa]], the Mondragão from [[Biscay]], the Acciauoli from [[Florence]], the Bettencourts from France, the Lemilhana Berenguer from [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] and many others.{{cn|date=October 2022}}

During the second half of the 15th century, the sugar industry expanded significantly along the southern coast, from Machico until Fajã da Ovelha, making Funchal the most important industrial centre of the industry. By the end of the century, fronting the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]], [[Manuel I of Portugal|D. Manuel]], [[Duke of Beja]], expanded the support of the local community; he ordered the construction of the administrative Paços do Concelho and the Paços dos Tabeliães (completed in 1491), raised the construction of a church (began in 1493 and later raised to [[cathedral]] in 1514), and finally the construction of a hospital and customs-house in the village. In 1508, it was elevated to the status of city by King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], and in 1514 (on completion of the Sé Cathedral) the bishopric was headquartered in Funchal.

[[File:Funchal, Portugal (1907).jpg|thumb|left|Funchal, 1907]]
The island, and Funchal specifically, were vulnerable to [[privateer]]s and pirate attacks.{{cn|date=October 2022}} In September 1566, French corsairs under the command of Bertrand de Montluc, a gentleman in the court of [[Charles IX of France]] and second-son of [[Field Marshal]] Blaise de Montluc, departed from [[Bordeaux]] with a force of 1200 men, on a small fleet of three main ships and eight support craft. The armada sacked [[Porto Santo]]. When the news was relayed to the settlements on Madeira and the villas of [[Machico]] and [[Santa Cruz, Madeira|Santa Cruz]], the citizenry armed themselves. In Funchal, the governor, Francisco de Sales Gonçalves Zarco da Câmara, did not take any hostile action. Meanwhile, the armada anchored off the beach of Formosa, disembarked a contingent of 800 men that marched towards the city in three columns, encountering no resistance until the main bridge in São Paulo.{{cn|date=October 2022}} At the bridge the privateers encountered a force from the small fort, with a few small-caliber pieces, which were quickly routed in confusion. At the road near Carreira, the attackers were confronted by a small group of Franciscan friars, who were quickly dispatched. Funchal's fortifications were finally assaulted by land, where its defense was thin; the defenders could not even reposition many of the cannons directed towards the sea. The city suffered a violent sack that lasted fifteen days, after which little remained.{{cn|date=October 2022}}

The following year, the military architect Mateus Fernandes III was sent to Funchal in order to completely modify the defensive system of the city. Evidence of the work produced by this architect was published in the "Mapa de Mateus Fernandes" (1573), considered to be the oldest plan of the island of Funchal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cm-funchal.pt/cmf/Default.aspx?SID=315|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607022624/http://www.cm-funchal.pt/cmf/Default.aspx?SID=315|url-status=dead|title=Cidade do Funchal e a sua Evolução Espacial|archive-date=7 June 2007|access-date=24 June 2010}}</ref> The document identifies the major defenses of the city, which included a large fortification in the area around the [[Dike (geology)|dyke]] in Pena.

During the 16th century, Funchal was an important stop-over for [[caravels]] travelling between the [[Indies]] and the [[New World]].{{cn|date=October 2022}}

[[File:Vista do Funchal, 1936.jpg|thumb|right|View of Funchal's bay in 1936]]
The wine culture appeared during early settlement, through the incentives from [[Henry the Navigator]]. By 1455, the [[Venice|Venetian]] navigator, [[Alvise Cadamosto|Luís de Cadamosto]], on visiting Madeira, referred to the excellence of the Madeirense wines, principally the [[Malvasia]] castes from the island of [[Crete]], which were being exported in greater numbers. By the end of the 16th century, the celebrated English [[poet]] and [[playwright]], [[William Shakespeare]], cited the important export and notoriety of the Madeiran Malvasia castes: in [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]] the Duke of Clarence, the brother of King [[Edward IV]] selected a death by drowning in a barrel of Madeira.{{cn|date=November 2022}} Later, in Shakespeare's ''[[Henry IV, Part 1|Henry IV]]'' he has Poins censure Falstaff for having sold his soul to the devil for a cup of Madeira wine. The growth of viticulture in Madeira expanded when the sugar industry was attacked by cheaper exports from the New World and Africa, but also from various epidemics and the after-effects of the 1566 privateer sacks.{{cn|date=November 2022}} In the 17th century, commercial treaties with England brought increased investments to a business that was still insular. Many commercial wine-makers from England moved to the island, changing the economy, architecture forms and lifestyle of the community. This incremental growth expanded the city with new estates, and a new merchant class that populated the urban quarters. Generally, there were many new three-floor homes with an intermediary service floor, a floor for storage and wine-cellars, and in some cases a tower to watch the port and monitor shipping in the harbour. Various island governors and the convents participated in commercial viticulture.{{cn|date=November 2022}} The Companhia de Jesus developed the vast estate of Campanário, which extended from the city to Fajã dos Padres into one of the most successful wines on the island, whereas the nuns of Santa Clara, owners of some large parcels of land, entered into the wine industry, financing the ships that would take their wines to Brazil (and exchanging them for sugar for their sweets business). But, during the 19th century there were epidemics, aggravating the economy and forcing some to return to sugar plantations. In order to maintain the level of development, many landowners tried to plant new more-resistant castes, but of an inferior quality, in order to support the industry.{{cn|date=October 2022}}

A few of the notable visitors to the region were [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Elisabeth]], empress of [[Austria-Hungary]], 1837–1898 (who travelled to the island for leisure and health), [[Charles I of Austria]] (who was exiled), Emperor of Austria and king of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], 1867–1918, Polish [[Field Marshal]] [[Józef Piłsudski]] in order to recuperate his health, [[Winston Churchill]] (who travelled there on holidays and was known to have painted a few paintings during his visits) and [[Fulgencio Batista]] (who stopped over en route to his exile in Spain).{{cn|date=November 2022}} The presence of these notable visitors marked a period when Funchal became a center of tourism and therapeutic health.{{cn|date=November 2022}} With the formal creation of the Port of Funchal, and later the establishment of the Santa Catarina Airport, Funchal turned into a major international tourist destination supported by a series of hotels and ocean-front residences.

==Geography==
[[File:Madeira 5 2014.jpg|thumb|300px|Promenade in southwest Funchal]]

===Physical geography===
Funchal is located inside a natural [[amphitheatre]]-shaped valley, with gentle slopes beginning at the coast which rise to 1200 metres and provide a natural shelter for early settlers

In addition to the urbanized area, the municipality includes the [[Ilhas Selvagens]] ({{langx|en|[[Savage Islands]]}}), a nature reserve located {{convert|294|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the capital.

===Climate===
According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Funchal has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa'') bordering on a [[tropical savanna climate]] (Köppen: ''As''). It is the warmest city in Portugal, with an annual temperature of {{convert|20.1|C|F}}.

The climate can be divided into two main seasons: a warm dry summer season spanning from May to September with average daily high temperatures ranging from {{convert|22|to|26|C|F}}, and a cool wet winter season from October to April with average daily high temperatures ranging from {{convert|20|to|25|C|F}}. The city has warm temperatures all year round, and humidity levels remain constantly high at about 70%. 

Sea temperatures range from a low of {{convert|18|C|F}} in February–March to {{convert|24|C|F}} in August–October.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.seatemperature.org/europe/portugal/funchal.htm |title=Funchal Sea Temperature |publisher=seatemperature.org |access-date=October 19, 2020}}</ref>

Since the city rises from the sea level up to altitudes of {{convert|800|m|ft}} on its northern slopes, it is quite common to experience cloudiness, fog and rain in the northern suburbs while, at the same time, having clear skies in the south. Temperatures also tend to be slightly lower at the higher altitudes.

Early summer, especially June, tends to be quite infamous due to a phenomenon where persistent cloudiness covers the entire bay area of the city, similar to the [[June Gloom]] phenomenon, locally nicknamed "Funchal's helmet". The length and severity of the wet and dry seasons varied greatly from year to year.

The municipality ({{langx|pt|concelho}}) and city ({{langx|pt|cidade}}) are one administrative division, administered by an executive and legislative committee in the city hall. Local communities, are administered at the civil parish levels, through their own legislative bodies and executives. Funchal comprises ten civil parishes ({{langx|pt|freguesias}}) based on traditional religious districts ({{langx|pt|paróquias}}):
* [[Imaculado Coração de Maria]] – a northern suburb, it is one of the smaller parishes in area, with the highest concentrations of residents (6951 residents in 2001);
* [[Monte (Funchal)|Monte]] – originally a summer refuge for the wealthy, due to its mild climate, Monte is symbolised by the toboggan drivers that race tourists down to the central town; today it is one of the more populated areas of Funchal with over 7500 inhabitants;
* [[Santa Luzia (Funchal)|Santa Luzia]] – one of the four urban suburbs of Funchal, developed from urban sprawl that expanded into the hinterland; today there are more than 6600 inhabitants in these foothills;

* [[Santo António (Funchal)|Santo António]] – the most populated civil parish in the municipality, developed from the concentration of small artisan shops, that developed until the 16th century; today the population includes approximately 22,000 residents;
* [[São Gonçalo (Funchal)|São Gonçalo]] – named after the explorer Gonçalo Aires Ferreira, in service to João Gonçalos Zarco, the lands of the parish were once the personal domains of this settler, who later took on the anointed name by its residents, due to his piety;
* [[São Martinho (Funchal)|São Martinho]] – its first settler Afonso Anes was responsible for the first artisanal and commercial buildings in the area, that was primarily sagricultural in scope; today the highly urbanized area pertains to 20,000 inhabitants and includes the hotel zone of Funchal known as Lido (named after the [[Lido Bathing Complex]]);
* [[São Pedro (Funchal)|São Pedro]] – central to the business and residential character of Funchal, São Pedro is a bedroom community of Sé, with 7681 residents;

[[File:Teleférico - Funchal 11.jpg|right|thumb|Famous cable car ride between Funchal and Monte, high up on Funchal's mountains]]
[[Madeira Airport]], often known as Funchal Airport (code: FNC) and officially Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport, is located east of the city, in the municipality of [[Santa Cruz, Madeira|Santa Cruz]]. The airport was one of the most dangerous airports in the world<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.holidify.com/pages/most-dangerous-airports-of-the-world-28.html |title=16 Most Dangerous Airports of The World for Runway Thrills! |first=Vidhi |last=Jhaveri |accessdate=26 June 2021 |work=holidify}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://aviatechchannel.com/top-10-dangerous-airports-in-the-world/ |title=Top 10 most dangerous airports in the world 2020 |work=Aviatech Channel |date=17 August 2020 |first=Sierra |last=Kilo}}</ref> due to the limited flat space in close proximity to cliffs, but the extension of the runway on concrete pillars in the sea has improved safety.

The [[Port of Funchal]] was the only major port in Madeira. Since 2007 it has been fully dedicated to passenger transport (cruise ships and ferries) and other tourist-related boats and yachts.  In that year all remaining fishing activity and cargo trade was moved to the newly developed port of [[Caniçal]], {{convert|12|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the east.<ref>{{cite web|title=Portos da Madeira|url=http://www.portosdamadeira.com/index2.php?t=1&l=pt|publisher=Administração dos Portos da Região Autónoma da Madeira|language=pt|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415103815/http://www.portosdamadeira.com/index2.php?t=1&l=pt|archive-date=15 April 2012|access-date=14 October 2012}}</ref>

A ferry service between Funchal and [[Portimão]], on the mainland, provided by [[Naviera Armas]] sailed weekly from 2008, but was discontinued in 2013 due to a dispute over harbour fees. In summer 2018 it was re-instated, but as a seasonal service from July to September, being operated by Grupo Sousa using Naviera Armas's ship ''Volcán de Tijarafe'', that provided the crossing prior to the 2013 discontinuation, with a maximum speed of 23 [[Knot (unit)|knots]]. The crossing takes around 24 hours.<ref>
