'''Palmdale''' is a city in northern [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. The city lies in the [[Antelope Valley]] of [[Southern California]]. The [[San Gabriel Mountains]] separate Palmdale from the [[Los Angeles Basin]] to the south.

On August 24, 1962, Palmdale became the first city in Antelope Valley. Forty-seven years later, in November 2009, voters approved making it a [[charter city]]. Palmdale's population was 169,450 at the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]], up from 152,750 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Palmdale is the [[List of largest cities in California by population|33rd most populous city in California]]. Together with its immediate northern neighbor, the city of [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]], the Palmdale–Lancaster [[urban area]] had a population of 359,559 in 2020.<ref name="urban area">{{cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/12/29/2022-28286/2020-census-qualifying-urban-areas-and-final-criteria-clarifications|title=2020 Census Qualifying Urban Areas and Final Criteria Clarifications|author=United States Census Bureau|website=Federal Register|date=December 29, 2022|access-date=January 2, 2023|archive-date=December 30, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221230035004/https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/12/29/2022-28286/2020-census-qualifying-urban-areas-and-final-criteria-clarifications|url-status=live}}</ref>

Spanish soldier Captain [[Pedro Fages]] explored the Antelope Valley in 1772. The opening of California to overland travel through the forbearing desert was due to Captain Juan Bautista de Anza and Father Francisco Garces, a Spanish padre. They led a colonizing expedition including 136 settlers across the Mojave Desert from [[Mexico]] to Monterey in 1773.

Later in 1776 while exploring the Valley, Garces with several Indian guides from the San Gabriel Mission recorded viewing the vast expanse of what was the El Tejon Rancheria (the Badger Ranch) of the Cuabajoy Indians. After the Shoshone Indians left the valley, immigrants from [[Spain]] and [[Mexico]] established large cattle ranches there. Then, in the late 1880s, the ranches were broken up into smaller homesteads by farmers from Germany, France and the state of Nebraska.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.com/location/california/antelope-valley/la-county/community/history.jsp|title=AV History – Los Angeles County – Waste Management|website=www.wm.com|access-date=October 30, 2018|archive-date=October 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030170350/http://www.wm.com/location/california/antelope-valley/la-county/community/history.jsp|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Palmenthal, 1886–1913===
"Palmenthal", the first European settlement within the limits of Palmdale, was established as a village on April 20, 1886, by westward Lutheran travelers from the American [[Midwest]], mostly of [[German Americans|German]] and [[Swiss Americans|Swiss]] descent. According to area folklore, the travelers had been told they would know they were close to the ocean when they saw [[Arecaceae|palm trees]]. They took the local [[Yucca brevifolia|Joshua tree]]s for palms and named their settlement after them. (''Palmenthal'' is German for ''Palm Valley.'')<ref name=Durham>{{cite book|last=Durham |first=David L.|title=California's Geographic Names – A Gazetteer of Historic and Modern Names of the State |year=1998 |page=1320|isbn=978-1-884995-14-9|publisher=Quill Driver Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://get.palmdalelibrary.org/?menu=1&section=1&page=6|title=Palmdalelibrary.org|date=December 9, 2014|access-date=November 6, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209200815/http://get.palmdalelibrary.org/?menu=1&section=1&page=6|archive-date=December 9, 2014}}</ref> According to David L. Durham, Joshua trees were sometimes called yucca palms at the time, which was the reason for the name.<ref name=Durham/> The village was officially established upon the arrival of a post office on June 17, 1888.

By the 1890s (soon after the last of the indigenous [[Pronghorn|antelope]]s, which the valley was named after, had been hunted to extinction by Europeans), farming families continued to migrate to Palmenthal and nearby ''[[Alpine, Los Angeles County, California|Harold]]'' to grow grain and fruit. Most of these settlers were unfamiliar with farming in a desert climate, so when the drought years occurred, most abandoned their [[Human settlement|settlement]].

By 1899, only one family was left in the original village. The rest of the settlers, including the post office, moved closer to the ''[[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]]'' [[railroad]] tracks. This new community was renamed Palmdale and was located where the present day [[civic center]] is. A railroad station was built along the tracks there. This railroad was operated by [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific]] and traveled between [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. The ''[[Wells Fargo]]'' stagecoach line that ran between San Francisco and [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] stopped there as well.<ref name="Los Angeles County Public Library">{{cite web|url=http://www.colapublib.org/history/antelopevalley/faq.html#q8|title=Antelope Valley: Frequently Asked Questions – County of Los Angeles Public Library|website=Colapublib.org|access-date=November 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107061244/http://www.colapublib.org/history/antelopevalley/faq.html#q8|archive-date=November 7, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The only remaining pieces of evidence of the original settlements of Palmenthal and Harold are the old Palmdale Pioneer cemetery located on the northeast corner of Avenue S and 20th Street East, acquired and restored by the city as part of a future historical park, and the old schoolhouse now relocated to ''McAdam Park''.

Palmdale's modern development commenced in the mid-1800s due to the influence of the gold rush, cattle ranching, the introduction of stagecoaches, and the establishment of the Southern Pacific Railroad line in 1876. Significant population expansion only took place after the completion of the California aqueduct in 1913, drawing in a considerable influx of farmers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://palmdale2045gp.org/history-and-profile/|title=History and Profile}}</ref>

===First two decades of the Town of Palmdale, 1913–1933===
As the population of Palmdale began to increase after relocation, water became scarce, until November 5, 1913, when the [[California Aqueduct|California – Los Angeles Aqueduct]] system was completed by [[William Mulholland]], bringing water from the Owens Valley into Los Angeles County. During this period, crops of apples, pears and alfalfa became plentiful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colapublib.org/history/antelopevalley/faq.html#q9|title=Antelope Valley: Frequently Asked Questions – County of Los Angeles Public Library|website=Colapublib.org|access-date=November 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107061244/http://www.colapublib.org/history/antelopevalley/faq.html#q9|archive-date=November 7, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colapublib.org/history/antelopevalley/faq.html#q10|title=Antelope Valley: Frequently Asked Questions – County of Los Angeles Public Library|website=Colapublib.org|access-date=November 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107061244/http://www.colapublib.org/history/antelopevalley/faq.html#q10|archive-date=November 7, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1915, Palmdale's first newspaper, the ''Palmdale Post'', was published. Today it is called the [[Antelope Valley Press]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailynews.com/2017/07/03/antelope-valley-press-sold-to-new-owner/|title= Antelope Valley Press sold to new owner|website= [[Los Angeles Daily News]]|date= July 3, 2017}}</ref>

In 1921, the first major motor vehicle link between Palmdale and Los Angeles was completed, Mint Canyon/Lancaster Road, later designated [[U.S. Route 6 (California)|U.S. Route 6]]. Completion of this road caused the local agricultural industry to flourish and was the first major step towards defining the metropolis that exists today. Presently this road is known as [[Sierra Highway]].<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book |title= Palmdale: How It All Began |publisher=City of Palmdale| date=1998}}</ref>

In 1924, the [[Little Rock Dam]] and the Harold Reservoir, present day [[Lake Palmdale]], were constructed to assist the agricultural industry and have enough water to serve the growing communities.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Next three decades of the Town of Palmdale, 1933–1962===

Agriculture continued to be the foremost industry for Palmdale and its northern neighbor [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]] until the outbreak of World War II. In 1933, the United States government established [[Muroc Air Base]] (from an original founder's name, Effie Corum, spelled backwards) {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} north of Lancaster in [[Kern County, California|Kern County]], now known as [[Edwards Air Force Base]].{{r|LAT 2012-05-29}}

They also bought Palmdale Airport in 1952 and established an aerospace development and testing facility called [[Plant 42|United States Air Force Plant 42]]. One year later, in 1953, [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] established a facility at the airport. After this point in time, the aerospace industry took over as the primary local source of employment.{{r|LAT 2012-05-29}} The city has been referred to as the "Aerospace Capital of America" because of its rich heritage in being the home of many of the aircraft used in the United States [[military]].<ref name="Los Angeles County Public Library"/>

In August 1956, an unpiloted out-of-control Navy drone flew over Palmdale while Air Force Interceptor aircraft tried to shoot it down with unguided rockets. Many rockets landed in and around the city, starting fires and damaging property.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Stilwell |first=Blake |date=September 21, 2023 |title=The Battle of Palmdale: That Time the Air Force Accidentally Bombed Southern California |url=https://www.military.com/history/battle-of-palmdale-time-air-force-accidentally-bombed-southern-california.html |access-date=September 27, 2023 |website=Military.com |language=en |archive-date=September 26, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230926163517/https://www.military.com/history/battle-of-palmdale-time-air-force-accidentally-bombed-southern-california.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1957, Palmdale's first high school, [[Palmdale High School]], was established, making it easier for youths to not have to travel to [[Antelope Valley High School]] in nearby Lancaster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phsfalcons.org/information/information.htm|title=Palmdale High School|website=Phsfalcons.org|access-date=November 6, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415133704/http://www.phsfalcons.org/information/information.htm|archive-date=April 15, 2008}}</ref>

===Incorporation, 1962–1980===
In August 1962, the township of Palmdale officially became the ''[[city]]'' of Palmdale with the incorporation of {{convert|2|mi2|km2|0|sp=us}} of land around the present day civic center.<ref name="Los Angeles County Public Library"/>

In 1964, the [[Antelope Valley Freeway]], or State Highway 14, was completed as a link between Palmdale and Los Angeles. The freeway at this time ran all the way to present-day Technology Drive. It was at this time that talk about the future ''Palmdale Intercontinental Airport'' was seen as the way of the future. By 1965, the new city had annexed an additional {{convert|20|sqmi|km2}} of land and industry was thriving. Talk of the future commercial [[airport]] had many investors buying up large quantities of land.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
[[File:Palmdale Freeway.jpg|thumb|left|[[California State Route 14|Antelope Valley Freeway]] looking southbound near downtown Palmdale on a day with sparse traffic.]] In 1970, the city of Los Angeles went forward with buying {{convert|17,750|acre|km2}} of land east of the city for its proposed intercontinental commercial airport. However, the United States Air Force desired to put construction of this new facility on hold until the existing airport reached its commercial capacity. So, under a joint use agreement with the military, the Los Angeles Department of Airports, now called [[Los Angeles World Airports]], built a 9,000 square foot (800 m<sup>2</sup>) terminal on leased land that opened in 1971, creating present day [[LA/Palmdale Regional Airport]] which the City of Palmdale has taken control of in an effort to establish reliable air service in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawa.org/pmd/pmdHistory.cfm|title=New LAWA Home Page|website=Lawa.org|access-date=November 6, 2017|archive-date=November 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107060546/http://www.lawa.org/pmd/pmdHistory.cfm|url-status=live}}</ref>

By 1974, the Antelope Valley Freeway construction ended at the southern border of [[Mojave, California|Mojave]] in Kern County. In 1977, Palmdale built its first municipal building, the Palmdale City Library. This was the same year that its northern neighbor Lancaster incorporated as a city. Since the 1920s, Lancaster had been the much larger and principal community of the [[Antelope Valley]], as well as the rest of California's [[Mojave Desert]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colapublib.org/history/antelopevalley/faq.html#q7|title=Antelope Valley: Frequently Asked Questions – County of Los Angeles Public Library|website=Colapublib.org|access-date=November 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107061244/http://www.colapublib.org/history/antelopevalley/faq.html#q7|archive-date=November 7, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===First housing market growth and recession, 1980–1990===
[[File:Central Palmdale.jpg|thumb|right|Central Palmdale looking north along 10th Street West toward Rancho Vista Boulevard]]

The 1980s and 1990s were the decades that really started to define the two Antelope Valley cities. [[Affordable housing]] in the area caused a dramatic spike in the [[population]]. The city, like its northern neighbor Lancaster, became a bedroom community for those employed in Los Angeles. In 1980, Palmdale's population was 12,227.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Geography==
[[File:Palmdale CA and Antelope Valley and Environs Landsat7.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite image showing the Antelope Valley area in relation to Los Angeles with the San Gabriel Mountains separating them.]]
Palmdale is located in [[Los Angeles County]], and the urbanized centers of Palmdale and Los Angeles are separated by the San Gabriel mountain range, which is about {{convert|40|mi|km}} wide. This range forms the southern edge of the Antelope Valley portion of the [[Mojave Desert]]. Palmdale is the second-most populous city in the Antelope Valley, and fifth overall in the Mojave Desert, after [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Henderson, Nevada|Henderson]], [[North Las Vegas, Nevada]]; and [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]]. Palmdale is part of a [[twin cities (geographical proximity)|twin-city]] complex with its northern neighbor [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]] and together they are the principal cities within the Antelope Valley region and California's [[High Desert (California)|High Desert]].

Downtown Palmdale is located at {{Coord|34|34|46|N|118|07|00|W|type:city_region:US-CA}},<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|archive-date=July 16, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220716004148/https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|url-status=live}}</ref> at an elevation of {{convert|2655|ft|m|0}} above sea level.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]] the city has a total area of {{convert|106.2|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|106.0|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.3|sqmi|km2}} of it is water (including man-made Lake Palmdale, the most visible and scenic part of the municipal water supply system). The total area is 0.24% water.

The city lies in proximity to the [[San Andreas Fault]], making it prone to severe earthquakes. This [[Fault (geology)|fault]] cuts across the [[Antelope Valley Freeway]] just north of the Avenue S off-ramp; running westward along the old Butterfield Stage Line (now Elizabeth Lake Road) into Leona Valley.

==Economy==
The most important industry for Palmdale is the [[aerospace]] industry.{{r|LAT 2012-05-29}} Other [[manufacturing]] companies have relocated to Palmdale seeking more affordable land, proximity to [[LA/Palmdale Regional Airport|Palmdale Airport]], and special tax breaks.

The special tax breaks granted for companies that relocate to Palmdale is due to the city having the '''Antelope Valley [[Enterprise Zone]]''' and the '''Palmdale Federal [[Foreign trade zones of the United States|Foreign Trade Zone]]'''. These are special zoning areas within the city that are given various state and federal tax breaks and municipal grant incentives to relocate their business there. These zones were put in effect to help Palmdale, as well as nearby Lancaster, draw more jobs to the area so that they would be less dependent on the [[Los Angeles Basin]] and the [[San Fernando Valley]] area for employment. This will help relieve traffic congestion and pollution and stabilize the Antelope Valley economy on several industries. The local governments of the Antelope Valley seek to diversify their economies and not just depend on the aerospace industry as it is known for having "feast or famine" seasons.

==Transportation==
According to the latest U.S. Census report released in September 2009, Palmdale has the longest average commute time in the United States at 41.5 minutes. This commute time exceeds that of even New York City. this is due to the majority of citizens commuting to nearby [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]] and farther south to [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090922/ap_on_go_ot/us_census_recession_s_impact_15 |title=Census: Recession had sweeping impact on US life - Yahoo!

===Airport===
{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2021}}
The [[LA/Palmdale Regional Airport]]/[[Plant 42|Air Force Plant 42]] (PMD) has two runways, each over {{convert|2.25|mi|km}} in length, although there is currently no commercial airline service at the airport. PMD's commercial terminal is owned and operated by [[Los Angeles World Airports]] (LAWA), a municipal department of the City of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], on leased land from the U.S. Air Force. Airline service has been sporadic since commercial flights were first offered in 1971. Most recently, [[United Express]]/[[SkyWest Airlines]] flew between PMD and [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]] from June 7, 2007, to December 6, 2008. The city of Palmdale formed the Palmdale Airport Authority to move forward to control the facilities and the lease with the USAF, to better develop regional air service in the [[High Desert (California)|High Desert]].

[[File:Palmdale Airport Terminal.jpg|thumb|right|LA/Palmdale Regional Airport Terminal]] LAWA also owns {{convert|17500|acre|km2|0}} of land adjacent to the existing airport. The land was acquired between 1970 and 1983 to be developed into "Palmdale Intercontinental Airport", intended to surpass the air traffic of [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]]. The land remains undeveloped. LAWA is currently developing a Master Plan for Palmdale that will guide airport land use and development decisions through 2030.

The [[FAA]]'s [[Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center]] is located adjacent to the airport.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/ZLA-ARTCC.pdf|title=Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC)}}</ref>

NASA has consolidated its research, environmental and training aircraft, support services and facilities at the Dryden Aircraft Operations Facility in Palmdale. From the oversized runway and the massive hangar located at Air Force Plant 42 Site 9, NASA conducts worldwide environmental research with its [[Lockheed U-2#ER-2 details|ER-2]] (a U-2 variant) and cutting edge deep space imaging with the 747-based [[SOFIA]] infrared telescope.

===Highways===
The [[Antelope Valley Freeway]] (SR 14) is the major north–south highway connecting Palmdale to Los Angeles and Mojave.

[[California State Route 138|State Route 138]] (SR 138) is the major east–west highway connecting Palmdale to the [[Inland Empire, California|Inland Empire]] and [[Frazier Park, California|Frazier Park]].

[[California State Route 18|State Route 18]] (SR 18) heads eastward out of the Antelope Valley connecting it to [[Victorville, California|Victorville]] and via [[Interstate 15 (California)|I-15]] the [[Barstow, California|Barstow]] area. This road is commonly used as a route to [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].

===Street system===
The street system in the Antelope Valley is set out in a grid. Unless otherwise named or curved around due to terrain, east–west roads are called avenues and north–south roads are called streets. The city is essentially on a perfect grid, and the traffic signals are coordinated by a central processing facility at the Civic Center.

'''East–west avenues''' are lettered mile-by-mile from north to south, starting with Avenue A on the Los Angeles-Kern County line. One mile south of Avenue A is Avenue B, and so on. Smaller roads between major avenues carry suffixes "-1" (nearest to the lettered avenue) through "-15" (nearest to the next lettered avenue). Some "-8" avenues can be major thoroughfares, for example, Avenue R-8 is halfway between Avenue R and Avenue S.

'''North–south streets''' are numbered with an "east" or "west" suffix with respect to their distances from Division Street. The number increases by 10 for each mile, so a mile east and west of Division Street lie "10th Street East" and "10th Street West" respectively. Some streets like 5th or 15th can also be major thoroughfares.

'''House addresses''' on east–west "avenues" are numbered according to the "streets". For example, "2001 East Palmdale Boulevard" is just east of 20th Street East, and "6066 West Avenue M-2" is just west of 60th Street West on Avenue M-2, which is 2/16 of a mile south of Avenue M.

On north–south streets, numbers are counted from downtown Los Angeles (thus increase from south to north), and while in the Antelope Valley, the difference is 800 per mile. For example, Palmdale Boulevard (geographically "Avenue Q-8") is 38400, Avenue Q is 38800, Avenue P is 39600, and so on. "37200 25th Street East" would be at the corner of Avenue S.

In accordance with Los Angeles County standards, odd numbers are on west and north sides of the road, and even numbers are on east and south sides of the road.

Avenue M is the general border of the connected population between Palmdale and Lancaster. Avenue L is actually the longer border between the two cities, east of Challenger Way, but is not as heavily populated. Avenue M has recently been named Columbia Way out of respect for the astronauts on board the [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] that disintegrated on re-entry in 2003. 10th Street East north of Columbia Way was renamed Challenger Way in 1987, in honor of those lost in the [[Challenger Disaster]]. (All of the shuttles were built in Palmdale.)

===Public transportation===
[[File:Palmdale Transportation Center.jpg|thumb|left|The Palmdale Transportation Center serves at the regional transit hub for the Antelope Valley.]]The [[Palmdale Transportation Center]], completed in March 2005, is the central mass transit center for the [[Antelope Valley]]. It serves as the transit hub for the [[Antelope Valley Transit Authority]], the city's public bus system, as well as an [[Amtrak]], [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound Bus]], and commuter rail [[Metrolink (California)|Metrolink]] station. The station is also designated a stop on the proposed [[California High-Speed Rail]] system and the proposed Orange Line Maglev rail from [[Irvine, California|Irvine]].
