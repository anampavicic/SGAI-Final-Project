==History==
The area of present-day Isehara City was part of several large ''[[shōen]]'' in [[Sagami Province]] during the [[Kamakura period]]. During the [[Edo period]], it was nominally part of [[Odawara Domain]], although large portions were ''[[tenryō]]'' territory controlled by the ''[[shōgun]]'' in [[Edo]] through various ''[[hatamoto]]''.

After the [[Meiji Restoration]] and with the establishment of the district system in 1878, the area came under the control of {{nihongo| [[Ōsumi District, Kanagawa|Ōsumi District]] |大住郡| Ōsumi-gun}}, Kanagawa Prefecture and became Isehara Town on April 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. On March 26, 1896, Ōsumi District and [[Yurugi District, Kanagawa|Yurugi District]] were merged to create [[Naka District, Kanagawa|Naka District]]. The town began to experience rapid growth after the opening of [[Isehara Station]] on the [[Odakyu Electric Railway]] on April 1, 1929. On December 21, 1954, the town expanded through merger with neighboring Oyama Town and three villages. Its area expanded further on September 30, 1956, through annexation of a portion of neighboring Okazaki Village. Isehara was elevated to city status on March 1, 1971.

==Government==
Isehara has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 20 members. Isehara contributes one member to the Kanagawa Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Kanagawa 16th district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Known primarily as a [[bedroom community]] for [[Yokohama]] and the greater [[Tokyo]] area, Isehara is also home to [[Amada Co]], a machine tool manufacturer and a number of manufacturing plants. It is also home to a Maru-Chan ([[Toyo Suisan]]) [[instant noodle]] factory.

==Education==
Isehara has ten public elementary schools and four public middle schools operated by the city government. The city has two public high schools operated by the Kanagawa Prefectural Board of Education, and the prefecture also operates one special education school for the handicapped. There is also one private high school. Tokyo-based [[Senshu University]], [[Sanno University]] and [[Tokai University]] all have a campus within Isehara.
