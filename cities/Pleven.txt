'''Pleven''' ({{langx|bg|Плèвен}} {{IPA|bg|ˈplɛvɛn|pron}}) is [[List of cities and towns in Bulgaria|the seventh most populous city]] in [[Bulgaria]]. Located in the northern part of the country, it is the administrative centre of [[Pleven Province]], as well as of the subordinate [[Pleven municipality]]. It is the biggest economic center in Northwestern Bulgaria. At the 2021 census its population was 89,823.

Internationally known for the [[siege of Plevna]] of 1877, today it is a major economic centre of the Bulgarian Northwest and Central North and the third largest city of [[Northern Bulgaria]] after [[Varna, Bulgaria|Varna]] and [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]].

==Name==
The name comes from the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] word ''plevnya'' ("barn") or from ''plevel'', meaning "weed", sharing the same root, and the Slavic [[suffix]] ''-en''.

==Geography==

Pleven is in an agricultural region in the middle of the [[Danubian Plain (Bulgaria)|Danubian Plain]], the historical region of [[Moesia]], surrounded by low limestone hills, the Pleven Heights. The city's central location in Northern Bulgaria defines its importance as a big administrative, economic, political, cultural and transport centre. Pleven is {{convert|170|km|0|abbr=off}} away from the capital city of [[Sofia]], {{convert|320|km|0|abbr=in}} west of the [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast]] and {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=in}} south of the [[Danube]].

The river [[Vit (river)|Vit]] flows near the city and the tiny Tuchenitsa river (commonly known in Pleven as ''Barata'', literally ''"The Streamlet"'') crosses it.

==History==
{{more citations needed section|date=January 2024}}

===Prehistory and antiquity===
The earliest traces of human settlement in the area date from the [[5th millennium BC]], the [[Neolithic]].
[[File:Pleven Antistene 4.jpg|left|thumb|The central streets of Pleven]]

Numerous archaeological findings, among them the Nikolaevo treasure found in [[Bulgaria]], evidence for the rich culture of the [[Thracians]], who inhabited the area for thousands of years.

In the beginning of the new era, the region became part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Moesia]], and a road station called [[Storgosia]] arose near present-day Pleven on the road from [[Oescus]] (near modern [[Gigen]]) to [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]] (now [[Plovdiv]]). It later evolved into a [[fortress]]. One of the most valued archaeological monuments in Bulgaria from the period is the [[Early Christian]] basilica from the fourth century discovered near the modern city.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Pleven TodorBozhinov October 2009 (1).jpg|right|thumb|[[Pleven Regional Historical Museum]]]]
During the [[Middle Ages]], Pleven was a well-developed stronghold of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|First]] and the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]]. When [[Slavs]] populated the region, they gave the settlement its contemporary name ''Pleven'', it was first mentioned in a charter by [[List of Hungarian rulers|Hungarian king]] [[Stephen V of Hungary|Stephen V]] in 1270 in connection to a military campaign in the Bulgarian lands.

===Ottoman rule===
During the [[History of Ottoman Bulgaria|Ottoman rule]], Pleven, known as ''Plevne'' in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], preserved its Bulgarian appearance and culture. Many churches, schools and bridges were built at the time of the [[Bulgarian National Revival]]. In 1825, the first secular school in the town was opened, followed by the first girls' school in Bulgaria in 1840, as well as the first boys' school a year later. Pleven was the place where the Bulgarian [[Folk hero|national hero]] [[Vasil Levski]] established the first revolutionary committee in 1869, part of [[Internal Revolutionary Organisation|his national revolutionary network]].

===Siege of Plevna===
{{main article|Siege of Plevna}}
The city (then mostly known as Plevna outside Bulgaria) was a [[Siege of Plevna|major battle scene]] during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877–1878 that Russian [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] held for the purpose of the liberation of Bulgaria. The joint [[Russia]]n and [[Romania]]n army paid dearly for the victory, but it paved the path to the defeat of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in this war, the restoration of Bulgaria as a state and the independence of Romania from the Ottoman Empire. It cost the Russians and Romanians 5 months and 38,000 casualties to take the town after four assaults, in what was one of the decisive battles of the war. The siege is remembered as a landmark victory of the [[Romanian War of Independence]], as on 28 November 1877 the Plevna citadel capitulated, and [[Osman Nuri Pasha|Osman Pasha]] surrendered the city, the garrison and his sword to the Romanian Colonel [[Mihail Cerchez]].
[[File:Pleven-Panorama-outside.JPG|thumb|right|[[Pleven Panorama]], one of the town's best known sights]]

In the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]] of 1911 [[s:Author:John Henry Verinder Crowe|J.H.V. Crowe]] concluded his lengthy entry on Pleven (transcribed as Plevna) with the memorable dictum:
{{cquote|Plevna is a striking example of the futility of the purely passive defence, which is doomed to failure however tenaciously carried out... Victories which are not followed up are useless. War without strategy is mere butchery.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |first=John Henry Verinder |last=Crowe |wstitle=Plevna#Investment and Fall of Plevna. |display=Plevna § Investment and Fall of Plevna |volume=21 |page=840}}</ref>}}

On the other hand, the siege of Plevna stands out among other countless sieges and military actions in the region because of its significance.<ref>"''The Balkan Wars''", Andre Gerolymatos, 2002, Basic Books, p.204</ref> 
{{cquote|Plevna is one of the few engagements that changed the course of history.<ref>"Struggle for Mastery", Taylor, pp.239–241</ref>}}

===Modern history===
The events of the Russo-Turkish War proved crucial for the development of Pleven as a key town of central northern Bulgaria. The town experienced significant demographic and economic growth in the following years, gradually establishing itself as a cultural centre of the region.

The [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]], a leading [[interwar]] party representing the Bulgarian peasantry, was founded in the town in December 1899.

Prior to the Bulgarian [[orthographic reform]] of 1945, the name of the town was spelled Плѣвенъ (with [[yat]]) in [[Cyrillic]].

Pleven is often regarded {{according to whom|date=November 2016}} as an important centre of sports in Bulgaria, with many noted Bulgarian sportspeople having been born and/or trained in the town, including [[Tereza Marinova]] and [[Galabin Boevski]].

The city hosts two [[football club]]s, [[Spartak Pleven]] and [[Belite orli]], which have separate stadiums. Both teams play in the second Bulgarian league and haven't had any major successes in the past, although Spartak Pleven has been the first team for a couple of former [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgarian internationals]] such as [[Plamen Getov]].

[[BC Spartak Pleven|Spartak Pleven]] is also a basketball team, a national championship winner in 1995 and national cup winner in 1996 (then named [[Plama Pleven]]). Other than that, the team is a regular first league participant.

Pleven is famous for its [[Kaylaka]] (where the ruins of the Storgosia fortification can be found) and [[Skobelev Park|Skobelev]] parks. The latter is home to the [[Pleven Panorama]] and is situated on the original location of the battle during the Russo-Turkish War.
