'''Kopeysk''' ({{langx|ru|Копе́йск}}) is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] in [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]], [[Russia]], located southeast of [[Chelyabinsk]]. Population: {{ru-census|p2021=147,806|p2010=137,601|p2002=73,342|p1989=79,048}} The population growth between 2002 and 2010 was caused by the annexation of surrounding settlements.

==History==
Prior to 1928, this city was called '''Ugolnye Kopi''', meaning ''coal mines'' (hence the pick on the city's coat of arms). The element "Ugolnye" was removed and the suffix "-sk" was added to indicate the locative.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/322038/Kopeysk Encyclopædia Britannica]</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Fontan kopejsk 2012.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Fountain in the square of Labor Glory]] 
Until the 1990s the main economic sectors were [[Coal]] (with mines such as "Capital",Currently, all the mines are closed due to the low quality of the coal and the high costs of production.
"Komsomolskaya", "Red Gornyachka", and "Central") and mechanical engineering &ndash; [[Kopeysk Machine-Building plant]] headquarter, the largest producer of coal and salt mining equipment in Russia, is located in this city.
In recent years Kopejsk has developed a diversified economy. The city recorded more than 1,000 industrial enterprises and more than 7,000 private entrepreneurs. Existing companies produce goods such as [[plastic film]], pipes with anticorrosive coating, ceramic [[proppant]] for the oil and gas industries, and [[vegetable oils]].

Housing is being constructed, for example in the [[satellite city]] of [[Chelyabinsk]].

== Administrative structure ==
Within the administrative-territorial framework of the [[Chelyabinsk Region]], Kopeysk is a city of regional importance, to which three rural settlements are subordinate. Within the context of local government, it constitutes the Kopeysky Urban District, which, in addition to the city, includes three rural localities: the villages of Kalachevo, Zaozerny and Sineglazovo. The city is divided into seven territorial departments, with one more territorial department being organized in the rural settlements that are subordinate to the city (the Kalachevsky district). In total, there are eight territorial departments that are part of the administration of Kopeysk's city district:

* Oktyabrsky territorial department
* Potaninsky territorial department
* Railway (Zheleznodorozhny) territorial department
* Vakhrushevsky territorial department
* Starokamyshinsky territorial department
* Kalachevsky territorial department
* Mining (Gornyatsky) territorial department
* Bazhovsky territorial department.

For many years, there has been discussion about joining the city of Kopeysk and later the Kopeysky urban district to become part of the Chelyabinsk (Chelyabinsk City District). The Chelyabinsk media reports that the majority of the population allegedly supports this initiative and is willing to vote in favor of it in a referendum. However, the heads and employees of municipal authorities have been categorically opposed due to fear of losing their homes. Pressure is being exerted on municipal institutions and companies with the requirement to cease supporting this initiative.
