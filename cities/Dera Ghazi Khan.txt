==History==
===Foundation===
{{See also|Derajat|History of Multan|History of Punjab|History of Sindh}}
Dera Ghazi Khan is named after a [[Dodai tribe|Dodai]] chieftain [[Ghazi Khan]], son of Haji Khan Mirani. It was founded at the end of 15th century when [[Baloch people|Baloch]] tribes were invited to settle the region by [[Husseyn Langah I|Shah Husein]], the second [[Langah Sultanate|Langah Sultan]]. Rao Kelana, a powerful [[Bhati]] Rajput ruler of [[Pugal]] in the 15th century invaded Dera Ghazi Khan and defeated the Balochs.<ref name=x>{{cite book |last1=Hooja |first1=Rima |title=A History of Rajasthan |date=2006 |publisher=Rupa & Company |isbn=978-81-291-0890-6 |pages=551 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tosMAQAAMAAJ&q=Varah |access-date=26 October 2024 |language=en}}</ref> Dera Ghazi Khan region was part of [[Subah of Multan|Multan province]] of the [[Mughal Empire]] between the 16th and 18th centuries.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Dasti |first=Humaira Faiz |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kH3jAAAAMAAJ&q=multan+a+province+of+mughal |title=Multan, a Province of the Mughal Empire, 1525-1751 |date=1998 |publisher=Royal Book |isbn=978-969-407-226-5 |language=en}}</ref>

Fifteen generations of [[Mirani (clan)|Mirani]]s ruled the area till the 19th century. In the beginning of the 19th century, Zaman Khan was the ruler of Dera Ghazi Khan under [[Kabul]]. The area was invaded by the [[Sikh Khalsa Army|Sikh Army]] from Multan under the command of [[Khushal Singh Jamadar|Khushal Singh]], general of [[Ranjit Singh]] in 1819 and thus Dera Ghazi Khan came under the Sikh rule.<ref>{{cite book |last=Latif |first= Syed Muhammad |date=1891 |title=History Of The Panjab |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.34649/page/n444/mode/1up |publisher=Calcutta Central Press Company Limited |page=419 |access-date=2009-11-29 }}</ref>

===Post independence===
After the success of the [[Pakistan Movement]], which led to the independence of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, many [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s [[Human migration|migrated]] to [[India]] while many [[Muslim]] refugees from [[India]] settled down in the [[Dera Ghazi Khan District]]. Many Hindus and Sikhs from Dera Ghazi Khan settled in [[Delhi]] and founded [[Derawal Nagar]] along with the migrants from [[Dera Ismail Khan]].<ref name="The Tribune - Derawal Nagar">{{cite web|url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030319/ncr1.htm| title = Colonies, posh and model in name only!|publisher = NCR Tribune|access-date = 16 December 2007}}</ref>

==Geography and climate==
Dera Ghazi Khan is located at 30'03" N and 70'38" E. The overall climate of the city is semi arid. The winter is mild and dry, but it is very hot and rainy in summer. The average high during summer is about {{convert|107|°F|°C|abbr=on}}, while during winter the average low is {{convert|40|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. The prevailing wind direction is north–south. Due to the barren mountains of [[Sulaiman Mountains|Koh-Suleman]] and the sandy soil of the area, windstorms are common in the summer. During summer, the temperatures are generally amongst the highest in Pakistan. [[Fort Munro]], located on the edge of Punjab province, has relatively cooler weather. In winter, scattered snowfall has been reported in high elevated areas of Koh e Sulaiman.
