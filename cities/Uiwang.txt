'''Uiwang''' ({{Korean|hangul=의왕}}; {{IPA|ko|ɰi.waŋ}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] in [[Gyeonggi]] Province, [[South Korea]].  It is one of many [[satellite city|satellite cities]] that ring Seoul, making up the [[Seoul Capital Area]].  Its largest immediate urban neighbor is [[Anyang, Gyeonggi|Anyang]].  The low peaks of the Gwangju Mountains (including [[Moraksan]]) shape the local landscape.

Rail transportation is important in Uiwang, which is home to the Korean Railroad Museum and Korea National Railroad College. [[Seoul Subway Line 1]] passes through the city, as does the [[Gyeongbu Line]]. In addition, a terminal of [[Hanjin]] container shipping is located here.

==Geography==
Uiwang lies just south of [[Seoul]]. It is bounded to the east by Baegunsan ({{Korean|labels=no|백운산}}), Barasan ({{Korean|labels=no|바라산}}), the lower slopes of Cheonggyesan ({{Korean|labels=no|청계산}}), and Maebongsan ({{Korean|labels=no|매봉산}}); to the south by the city of [[Suwon]], to the west by [[Ansan]], [[Gunpo]], and [[Anyang, Gyeonggi|Anyang]]; and to the north by [[Gwacheon]].

There are two noteworthy reservoirs in the city: Baegun Lake ({{Korean|labels=no|백운호수}}) at the foot of Baegunsan, and Wangsong Lake ({{Korean|labels=no|왕송호수}}), by the border with [[Suwon]]. Baegun Lake has a number of foreign restaurants, while Wangsong Lake, accessible from [[Uiwang Station]], has a recreational [[draisine]], the Korean Railroad Museum, and Uiwang's Nature Education Park. The source of the Anyangcheon - a tributary of the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] - is in Uiwang, as is the source of the Haguicheon, itself a tributary of the Anyangcheon. Most of Uiwang is thus drained northwards. However, the Hwanggujicheon's source is also in Uiwang, and this flows south, eventually emptying into the [[Yellow Sea]] at Asan Bay.

==History==

* 1 April 1914: Gwangju-gun's Uigok-myeon ({{Korean|labels=no|의곡면}}) and Wangnyun-myeon ({{Korean|labels=no|왕륜면}}) were combined and transferred to Suwon-gun, which renamed it Uiwang-myeon ({{Korean|labels=no|의왕면}}).
* 1 October 1936: Ilhyeong-myeon ({{Korean|labels=no|일형면}}) was incorporated into Uiwang-myeon.
* 14 August 1949: The district was transferred to Hwaseong-gun, and was renamed Ilwang-myeon ({{Korean|labels=no|일왕면}}).
* 1 January 1963: Ilhyeong-myeon was transferred to Suwon City, while the remainder became Uiwang-myeon, now in Siheung-gun..
* 1 December 1980: Uiwang-myeon became Uiwang-eup.
* 15 February 1983: Woram-ri ({{Korean|labels=no|월암리}}) and Chopyeong-ri ({{Korean|labels=no|초평리}}), formerly in Hwaseong-gun's Banwol-myeon ({{Korean|labels=no|반월면}}), were transferred to Uiwang-eup.
* 1 March 1983: Naeson-ri ({{Korean|labels=no|내손리}}), Poil-ri ({{Korean|labels=no|포일리}}), Cheonggye-ri ({{Korean|labels=no|청계리}}), and Hagui-ri ({{Korean|labels=no|학의리}}) were put under the jurisdiction of Uiwang-eup's Eastern Branch Office.
* 1 January 1989: Uiwang separated from Siheung-gun, forming its own city.
* 20 February 2007: The Chinese characters used in the name of Uiwang were changed from {{lang|ko|{{linktext|儀|旺}}}} to {{lang|ko|{{linktext|義|王}}}}.

In recent times, Uiwang has developed considerably thanks to the expansion of [[Anyang, Gyeonggi|Anyang]]. Several districts are also directly connected with [[Gunpo]] and [[Suwon]].
