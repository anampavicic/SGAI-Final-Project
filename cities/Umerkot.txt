[[File:Shiv Mandir Umerkot.jpg|thumb|[[Umerkot Shiv Mandir]]-major pilgrimage centre in Sindh]]
'''Amarkot''' ([[Urdu]]: {{Nastaliq|امر ڪوٽ}}; [[Dhatki language|Dhatki]] : امرڪوٽ ;[[Sindhi language|Sindhi]]: عمرڪوٽ; <small>[[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA:]]</small> [[Help:IPA/Hindi and Urdu|[ʊmərkoːʈ]]], formerly known as '''Amarkot''') is a city in the [[Sindh]] province of [[Pakistan]]. The Mughal emperor [[Akbar]] was born in Umerkot in 1542. The Hindu folk deities [[Pabuji]] and [[Ramdev Pir|Ramdev]] married in Umerkot.

The local language is [[Dhatki]], one of the [[Rajasthani languages]] of the [[Indo-Aryan language]] family. It is most closely related to [[Marwari language|Marwari]]. [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Urdu]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] are also understood by the citizens.

This fort was built by Amar Singh Sodhi and hence it is called Amar Kot. This fort came under the control of Umar Soomro much later.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Birthplace of Akbar.JPG|thumb|The birthplace of [[Akbar]] is traditionally believed to be marked by the small pavilion.]]
The city is named after a local ruler of [[Sindh]], Umer Soomro (of [[Soomra dynasty]]) of the [[Umar Marvi]] folk tale, which also appears in ''[[Shah Jo Risalo]]'', one of the popular tragic romances of Sindh.<ref name="Hasan2005">{{cite book|author=Shaikh Khurshid Hasan|title=Historical Forts In Pakistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HH_fAAAAMAAJ|date=1 January 2005|publisher=National Institute of Historical & Cultural Research Centre of Excellence, Quaid-i-Azam University|isbn=978-969-415-069-7}}</ref> However, the myth of Umer Marvi is believed to have been made up to Islamize the history of sanam pagal, which was named after its original founder, sanam pagal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1157340|date=16 January 2015|website=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|author=Taha Siddiqui|title=Footprints: Once upon a time in Umerkot}}</ref>

==History==

{{Main|Sodhas of Amarkot}}

According to tradition, it was founded by a branch of the [[Soomro|Soomra]] who later lost it to Sodhas in 1226. Sodhas were expelled by the Soomra in 1330 but again rose to power in 1439. In 1590, it became a part of the [[Mughal Empire]]. In 1599, Abu ’l-Ḳāsim Sulṭān, an [[Arghun dynasty]] prince drove out the Mughal commander. In 1736, [[Noor Mohammad Kalhoro]] expelled the last Sodha chief and took control of it.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ansari |first1=A.S Bazmee |editor1-last=Bearman |editor1-first=P.J. |title=Amarkot |journal=Encyclopaedia of Islam New Edition Online (EI-2 English) |date=24 April 2012 |doi=10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_0581 |url=https://doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_0581 |publisher=Brill |language=en |issn=1573-3912}}</ref> Amarkot province was ruled by the [[Sodha|Sodha Rajput]] clan during the medieval period.<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00litlinks/gulbadan/part10.html Part 10:..the birth of Akbar] ''[[Humayun]] nama'' by [[Gulbadan Begum]].</ref> [[Rana Parshad Sodha|Rana Parshad]], the Sodha Rajput ruler of Umarkot, gave refuge to [[Humayun]], the second Mughal Emperor when he was ousted by [[Sher Shah Suri]], and the following year Mughal Emperor, [[Akbar]], was born here.<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00litlinks/gulbadan/part10.html Part 10:..the birth of Akbar] ''[[Humayun-nama]]'' by [[Gulbadan Begum]].</ref> Later on, Akbar brought northwestern India, including modern Pakistan, under [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule.

After the disintegration of the Mughal Empire, Amarkot was captured by several regional powers, including the [[Persians]], Afghans, [[Kalhora]] and [[Talpur]] [[Baloch people|Balochs]] of Sindh, [[Rathore (Rajput clan)|Rathore]] [[Rajput]]s of [[Jodhpur]] and finally by the [[British Empire|British]].<ref name="researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz">{{cite web| url=https://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10063/8776/thesis.pdf?sequence=1 | title=SINDH IN TRANSITION: FROM MUGHAL RULE TO BRITISH ANNEXATION, EARLY EIGHTEENTH CENTURY TO 1843}}</ref>

After the British conquered Sindh, they made it part of the [[Bombay Presidency]] of [[British India]]. In 1858, the entire area around [[Tharparkar]] became part of the Hyderabad District. In 1860 the region was renamed [[Tharparkar|Eastern Sindh Frontier]], with a  headquarters at Amarkot. In 1882, it was reorganized as the [[Tharparkar|Thar and Parkar district]], headed by a British Deputy Commissioner, with a political superintendent at ''Amarkot''.<ref>David Ross C.I.E., ''The land of the five rivers and Sindh'' (1883), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bH4BAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA33 p. 33]</ref> However, in 1906 the district headquarters moved from Amarkot to [[Mirpur Khas]].

[[Rana Chandra Singh]], a federal minister and the chieftain of the [[Hindu]] [[Sodha]] [[Thakur (title)|Thakur]] [[Rajput]] clan and the [[Amarkot Jagir]], was one of the founding members of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) and was elected to the [[National Assembly of Pakistan]] from Umarkot seven times as a PPP member between 1977 and 1999, when he founded the Pakistan Hindu Party (PHP).<ref>{{cite web|title=Hindu Leader, Ex-minister Chardar Singh is Dead|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/displayarticle.asp?xfile=data/international/2009/August/international_August122.xml&section=international&col=|date=3 August 2009|work=[[Khaleej Times]]|access-date=3 August 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608211713/http://www.khaleejtimes.com/displayarticle.asp?xfile=data%2Finternational%2F2009%2FAugust%2Finternational_August122.xml&section=international&col=|archive-date=8 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="Chieftain of Pakistani Hindu Thakurs dies">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009\08\02\story_2-8-2009_pg12_6|title=Chieftain of Pakistani Hindu Thakurs dies |last=Guriro |first=Amar|date=2 August 2009|work=Daily Times|access-date=2 August 2009}}</ref> Currently, his politician son [[Rana Hamir Singh]] claims to be the 26th [[Rana (title)|Rana]] of Tharparkar, Umarkot and Mithi.<ref name=hamir1>[https://www.dawn.com/news/1157340 Footprints: Once upon a time in Umerkot], [[Dawn (newspaper)]], 16 January 2015.</ref><ref name=hamir2>[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/Pakistans-Umerkot-gets-a-new-Hindu-ruler/article16042843.ece Pakistan's Umerkot gets a new Hindu ruler], [[The Hindu]], 30 May 2010.</ref>
