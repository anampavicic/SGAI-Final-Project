'''Taldykorgan''' ({{langx|kk|Талдықорған}}, {{lang|kk-latn|Taldyqorğan}}, {{IPA-kk|tɑɫˌdəqorˈʁɑn|pron|Kk-taldykorgan.ogg}}; {{langx|ru|Талдыкорган}}), formerly spelled '''Taldy-Kurgan''' until 1993, is the capital (called an administrative center) of [[Jetisu Region]], [[Kazakhstan]]. According to the [[2010 Kazakh Census]], the population is 143,407.

The town was founded in the 19th century as the village of Gavrilovka and developed into the present city on the same site. The town grew slowly in its early years. After the completion of the railway connection many Russian farmers moved to the area of the town. Russians are the second-largest ethnic group after the Kazakhs among the 70 nationalities living in Taldykorgan. A total of 143,000 people live in the city.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Taldykorgan|url=https://samarkandtours.com/kazakhstan/taldykorgan/|access-date=April 13, 2021}}</ref> Taldykorgan previously served as the capital city of Taldykorgan Region from 1944 to 1997 and [[Almaty Region]] from 1997 to 2022 and now serves as the capital of the new [[Jetisu Region]]. The change was announced by [[President of Kazakhstan|President]] [[Kassym-Jomart Tokayev|Tokayev]] on 16 March 2022 and officially came into force on 8 June 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |title=В Казахстане появится четыре новых региона|url=https://www.interfax.ru/world/828462 |access-date=2022-04-20 |website=Interfax.ru |language=ru}}</ref> In that same decree, the capital of Almaty Region was moved to the city of [[Konaev]].

During WWII, Taldykorgan also served as a temporary home for thousands of evacuees from the Soviet Union's western regions. Thousands of women and children from Southern Ukraine were able to evacuate by ship to Novorossiysk and travel inland by train to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.
