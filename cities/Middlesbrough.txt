'''Middlesbrough''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Middlesbrough.ogg|ˈ|m|ɪ|d|əl|z|b|r|ə}} {{respell|MID|əlz|brə}}) is a port town in [[North Yorkshire]], England. The town's built-up area, an area spanning from the south bank of the [[River Tees]], up to and including [[Coulby Newham]] and [[Nunthorpe]], had a population of 148,215<ref name="2021census">{{Cite web |title=Figure 1: Explore population characteristics of individual BUAs |url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc2257a/fig1/datadownload.xlsx |access-date=7 August 2021 |archive-date=5 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230805183245/https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc2257a/fig1/datadownload.xlsx |url-status=live }}</ref> at the [[2021 UK Census]]. [[Borough of Middlesbrough|The town's borough]] (of similar size) is governed by [[Middlesbrough Council]]. It is the [[postal town]] further south (including [[Stokesley]] and [[Great Ayton]]) to the [[North York Moors National Park]].<ref name="2021census" /> The largest town of [[Teesside]] and the largest of the [[Tees Valley]] region, it is the direct regional centre for a population of 678,400 in 2021<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/comb/1853882374/report.aspx|title=Labour Market Profile - Tees Valley|access-date=24 January 2023|archive-date=20 December 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231220150643/https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/comb/1853882374/report.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref> and de facto centre for northern [[Yorkshire]] and southern [[County Durham]].

A hamlet surrounded by rural farmland, until the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] expanded in 1830 linking the area's existing economy, the settlement had booms in [[heavy industry]] during early 19th century and late 19th century. The town became too reliant on existing declining sectors in the 20th century with diversity of the economy slowly increasing during the late-20th to early-21st centuries. Some of the town's major economic sectors by age of the oldest to newest are a [[port]], [[ship building]], [[coal]] (former), [[ironworks]], [[steel production]] (metalworks have moved eastwards to between [[Eston]] and [[Redcar]]), [[education]] (notably [[Teesside University]] and [[Middlesbrough College]]) and the [[health sector]].

Part of Yorkshire since before the [[Domesday Book]], the settlement became a town (with a [[municipal borough]]) in 1853. With Yorkshire divided into its ancient ridings in 1889, the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]] town was large enough to become a [[county borough]], independent from the then new [[North Riding County Council]]. In 1968, the borough of Middlesbrough was merged into the larger [[County Borough of Teesside]]. Six years later (1974), a borough with the town's name was re-established within the new county of [[Cleveland (county)|Cleveland]]. The new county was abolished in 1996 and since then the town's borough has had [[unitary authority]] status and been within North Yorkshire's [[ceremonial county]]. Councils of the four former Cleveland boroughs and for the borough of Darlington each have had a representative seat on the [[Tees Valley Combined Authority]] cabinet, since 2016. The  [[combined authority]] has had a [[Tees Valley Mayor|directly elected mayor]] since 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/449/made|title=The Tees Valley Combined Authority Order 2016|publisher=Legislation.gov.uk|access-date=10 August 2016|archive-date=26 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826113350/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/449/made|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
{{further|History of Middlesbrough}}
===Monks and lords===
Middlesbrough started as a [[Benedictine]] priory on the south bank of the [[River Tees]], its name possibly derived from it being midway between the holy sites of [[Durham, England|Durham]] and [[Whitby]]. The earliest recorded form of Middlesbrough's name is "Mydilsburgh". Some believe the name means "middle fortress", as it was midway between the two religious houses of Durham and Whitby; others state that it is an [[Old English]]  personal name (''Midele'' or ''Myhailf'') combined with ''burgh'' meaning town.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ekwall |first=Eilert |author-link=Eilert Ekwall |title=The concise Oxford dictionary of English place-names |date=1960 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-869103-3 |edition=4 |location=Oxford |page=324}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Johnston |first=James Brown |title=The place-names of England and Wales |date=1915 |publisher=Murray |location=London |page=368 |oclc=1050761076}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Chrystal |first=Paul |title=The Place Names of Yorkshire; Cities, Towns, Villages, Rivers and Dales, some Pubs too, in Praise of Yorkshire Ales |date=2017 |publisher=Stenlake |isbn=9781840337532 |edition=1 |location=Catrine |page=58}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=A.&nbsp;H. |title=The Place Names of the North Riding of Yorkshire |date=1979 |publisher=English Place Name Society |page=160 |oclc=19714705 |orig-date=1928}}</ref>

In 686, a monastic cell was consecrated by [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|St. Cuthbert]] at the request of [[Hilda of Whitby|St. Hilda]], Abbess of [[Whitby]]. The cell evolved into [[Middlesbrough Priory]]. The manor of Middlesburgh belonged to [[Whitby Abbey]] and [[Gisborough Priory]].<ref name="page">{{Cite web |last=Page |first=William |title=Parishes: Middlesborough [sic] Pages 268–273 A History of the County of York North Riding: Volume 2.

After the [[Anglo-Saxons|Angles]], the area became home to [[Viking]] settlers. Names of Viking origin (with the suffix {{lang|da|by}} meaning ''village''<ref>{{Cite web |last=Harbeck |first=James |title=Why does Britain have such bizarre place names? |url=https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160309-why-does-britain-have-such-bizarre-place-names |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210106194342/https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160309-why-does-britain-have-such-bizarre-place-names |archive-date=6 January 2021 |access-date=16 December 2020 |publisher=BBC Culture}}</ref>) are abundant in the area; for example, [[Ormesby]], [[Stainsby, North Yorkshire|Stainsby]] and [[Tollesby]] were once separate villages that belonged to [[Vikings]] called Orm, Steinn and Toll that are now areas of Middlesbrough were recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086.

===Coal and docks===
In 1801, Middlesbrough was a small farming [[Township (England)|township]] with a population of just 25. From the 1829 onwards it experienced rapid growth. In 1828 the influential [[Quaker]] banker, coal mine owner and [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] (S&DR) shareholder [[Joseph Pease (railway pioneer)|Joseph Pease]] sailed up the River Tees to find a suitable new site downriver of Stockton on which to place new coal [[staithe]]s. As a result, in 1829 he and a group of [[Quaker]] businessmen bought the Middlesbrough farmstead and associated estate, some {{convert|527|acre}} of land, and established the Middlesbrough Estate Company.

Through the company, the investors set about a new coal port development (designed by [[John Harris (railway engineer)|John Harris]]) on the southern banks of the Tees.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Middlesbrough |url=http://www.billyscarrow.co.uk/middlesbrough.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705070805/http://www.billyscarrow.co.uk/middlesbrough.htm |archive-date=5 July 2015 |access-date=4 July 2015 |publisher=Billy Scarrow}}</ref><ref name="englandsnortheast.co.uk" /> The first coal shipping staithes at the port (known as "Port Darlington") were constructed with a settlement to the east established on the site of Middlesbrough farm as labour for the port, taking on the farm's name as it developed into a village.<ref name="GazDock">{{Cite news |last=Delplanque |first=Paul |date=17 November 2011 |title=Middlesbrough Dock 1839–1980 |url=http://rememberwhen.gazettelive.co.uk/2011/11/middlesbrough-dock-1839-1980.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409123451/http://rememberwhen.gazettelive.co.uk/2011/11/middlesbrough-dock-1839-1980.html |archive-date=9 April 2013 |access-date=24 March 2013 |work=[[Teesside Gazette|Evening Gazette]]}}</ref><ref name="Middlesbrough College">{{Cite web |title=The Archives: History of Middlehaven |url=http://www.mbro.ac.uk/Home/index/collegeinfo/collegehistory/middlehaven.aspx |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120225741/http://www.mbro.ac.uk/Home/index/collegeinfo/collegehistory/middlehaven.aspx |archive-date=20 November 2015 |access-date=20 November 2015 |publisher=Middlesbrough College}}</ref> 

The port was linked to the S&DR on 27 December 1830 via a branch that extended to an area just north of the current {{stnlnk|Middlesbrough}} railway station.<ref>{{Cite web |title=December 1861 map of Middlesbrough North Riding: A Vision of Britain Through Time |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/25079 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019014334/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/25079 |archive-date=19 October 2014 |access-date=18 October 2014 |publisher=University of Portsmouth and others}}</ref>

The success of the port meant it soon became overwhelmed by the volume of imports and exports, and in 1839 work started on a dock to the east of Middlesbrough.<ref name=GazDock/> The first water for the dock was let in on 19 March 1842, the formal opening took place on 12 May 1842.

===Iron, steel and ships===

Iron dominated the Tees area since 1841 when [[Henry Bolckow]] in partnership with [[John Vaughan (ironmaster)|John Vaughan]], founded the Vulcan [[iron foundry]] and [[rolling mill]]. Vaughan introduced the new "Bell Hopper" system of closed blast furnaces developed at the [[Ebbw Vale]] works. The new system and nearby abundant supply of [[Ironstone]] in the [[Eston Nab|Eston Hills]] in 1850, made the works a success with the area becoming known as the "Iron-smelting centre of the world" and [[Bolckow, Vaughan|Bolckow, Vaughan & Co., Ltd]] the largest company in existence at the time.<ref name="ICE">Institution of Civil Engineers, ''Obituary'', 1869.</ref>

Henry Bolckow became mayor, in 1853.<ref name="page" />

In the latter half of the 19th century, Old Middlesbrough was starting to decline and was overshadowed by developments built around the [[Middlesbrough Town Hall|new town hall]], south of the [[Old Town Hall, Middlesbrough|original town hall]].<ref>Woodhouse, Robert.

On 15 August 1867, a Reform Bill was passed, making Middlesbrough a new parliamentary borough, Bolckow was elected member for Middlesbrough the following year. In 1900, [[Bolckow Vaughan|Bolckow, Vaughan & Co]] had become the largest producer of steel in Great Britain.

The town's rapid expansion continued throughout the second half of the 19th&nbsp;century (fuelled by the iron and steel industry), the population reaching 90,000 by the dawn of the 20th century.<ref name="englandsnortheast.co.uk" />

===Second World War===
Middlesbrough was the first major British town and industrial target to be bombed during the [[Second World War]]. The steel making capacity and railways for carrying steel products were obvious targets. The [[Luftwaffe]] first bombed the town on 25 May 1940, when a lone bomber dropped 13 bombs between South Bank Road and the South Steel plant.<ref>{{Cite news |date=September 2010 |title=Remembering the Blitz |url=http://rememberwhen.gazettelive.co.uk/2010/09/remembering-the-blitz.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413131651/http://rememberwhen.gazettelive.co.uk/2010/09/remembering-the-blitz.html |archive-date=13 April 2014 |access-date=20 August 2012 |work=Evening Gazette}}</ref> More bombing occurred throughout the course of the war, with the [[Middlesbrough railway station|railway station]] put out of action for two weeks in 1942.<ref>{{Cite news |date=April 2010 |title=Middlesbrough Railway Station bombed 1942 |url=http://rememberwhen.gazettelive.co.uk/2010/04/middlesbrough-railway-station.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519084800/http://rememberwhen.gazettelive.co.uk/2010/04/middlesbrough-railway-station.html |archive-date=19 May 2011 |access-date=14 May 2011 |work=Evening Gazette}}</ref>

By the end of the war over 200 buildings had been damaged or destroyed within the Middlesbrough area. Areas of early and mid-Victorian housing were demolished and much of central Middlesbrough was redeveloped. Heavy industry was relocated to areas of land better suited to the needs of modern technology. Middlesbrough itself began to take on a completely different look.<ref>{{Cite web |date=4 August 1942 |title=Middlesbrough 1940s |url=http://www.billmilner.250x.com/mbro40.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202051719/http://www.billmilner.250x.com/mbro40.html |archive-date=2 December 2008 |access-date=4 September 2011 |publisher=Billmilner.250x.com}}</ref>

===Post-war rebuild===
[[File:A66, Middlesbrough - geograph.org.uk - 274831.jpg|thumb|A66 from a multi-storey car park in 2006 (the road is raised with Wilson Street running adjacent)]]
Post war industrial to contemporary un-industrial Middlesbrough has changed the town, multiple buildings replaced and roads built. The [[A66 road]] was built through the town in the 1980s; Middlesbrough's Royal Exchange building was demolished to make way for the road. 

[[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough F.C.'s]] modern [[Riverside Stadium]] opened on 26 August 1995 next to Middlesbrough Dock. The club moved from their previous home in the town for 92 years, [[Ayresome Park]].

The original St.Hilda's area of Middlesbrough, after decades of decline and clearance, was given a new name of ''Middlehaven'' in 1986 on investment proposals to build on the land.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web |last=Price |first=Kelley |date=16 June 2019 |title=Did the 'Middlehaven dream-maker' achieve what he set out to do? |url=https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/highs-lows-middlehavens-regeneration-dream-16251398 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200924043757/https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/highs-lows-middlehavens-regeneration-dream-16251398 |archive-date=24 September 2020 |access-date=29 November 2020 |website=TeessideLive}}</ref> [[Middlehaven]] has since had new buildings built there including [[Middlesbrough College]] and Middlesbrough FC's Riverside Stadium amongst others.

The expansion of Middlesbrough southwards, eastwards and westwards continued throughout the 20th century absorbing villages such as [[Linthorpe]], [[Acklam, Middlesbrough|Acklam]], [[Ormesby]], [[Marton, Middlesbrough|Marton]] and [[Nunthorpe]]<ref name="englandsnortheast.co.uk" /> and continues to the present day.

== Governance ==
{{See also|Middlesbrough Council|Borough of Middlesbrough|History of local government in Yorkshire}}
The local authority is [[Middlesbrough Council]], a [[unitary authority]]. Middlesbrough also forms part of the [[Tees Valley Combined Authority]].

===Administrative history===
Middlesbrough was historically a [[Township (England)|township]] in the [[ancient parish]] of [[Acklam, Middlesbrough|West Acklam]] in the [[Langbaurgh Wapentake]] (also known as [[Cleveland, Yorkshire|Cleveland]]) of the [[North Riding]] of [[Yorkshire]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Middlesbrough North Riding |url=https://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/455/units |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220118171919/https://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/455/units |archive-date=18 January 2022 |access-date=19 September 2021}}</ref> After the [[Dissolution of the monasteries|dissolution of the monastery]] in 1539 the former Middlesbrough Priory was used as a [[chapel of ease]] to West Acklam for a time, but by about 1660 the building had been demolished. Despite having no church building, a [[perpetual curacy]] of Middlesbrough was created in 1744, also covering the neighbouring township of [[Linthorpe]], and the curacy of Middlesbrough gradually came to be treated as a [[civil parish]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tweddell |first=George Markham |url=https://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/YKS/NRY/Middlesbrough/Middlesbrough90 |title=Bulmer's History and Directory of North Yorkshire |date=1890 |access-date=17 September 2023 |archive-date=12 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231212065804/https://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/YKS/NRY/Middlesbrough/Middlesbrough90 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Youngs |first=Frederic A. |title=Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England: Volume II |date=1991 |publisher=Royal Historical Society |isbn=0861931270 |location=London |page=582}}</ref>

After construction of the modern town began in 1830, there was a need for more urban forms of local government. In 1841 a body of [[improvement commissioners]] was set up covering the township of Middlesbrough and part of the township of Linthorpe.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Middlesbrough Improvement and Market Act 1841 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Vict/4-5/68/contents/enacted |access-date=17 September 2023 |website=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives |archive-date=1 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230901225945/https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Vict/4-5/68/contents/enacted |url-status=live }}</ref> The commissioners were superseded in 1853 when the same area was made a [[municipal borough]]. The borough boundaries were extended in 1858, 1866 and 1887.<ref>Middlesbrough Improvement Act 1858 (21 & 22 Vict. c. 140)</ref><ref>Middlesbrough Extension and Improvement Act 1866 (29 & 30 Vict. c. 143)</ref> When elected county councils were created in 1889 under the [[Local Government Act 1888]], Middlesbrough was considered large enough to provide its own county-level services and so it became a [[county borough]], independent from the new [[North Riding County Council]], whilst remaining part of the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]] for ceremonial purposes.<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=act|act=Local Government Act 1888|year=1888|chapter=41|access-date=18 September 2023}}</ref>

By this time the borough covered the civil parish of Middlesbrough and parts of the parishes of Linthorpe (where the old township had been made a separate parish in 1866), [[Marton, Middlesbrough|Marton]], [[Normanby, Redcar and Cleveland|Normanby]], [[Ormesby]] and West Acklam. The [[Local Government Act 1894]] said that parishes could no longer straddle borough boundaries, and so the parish of Middlesbrough was enlarged to cover the whole borough.<ref name="VoB">{{Cite web |title=Middlesbrough Civil Parish |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10448785#tab02 |access-date=18 September 2023 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |archive-date=18 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231018034133/https://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10448785#tab02 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gFIwAQAAMAAJ&dq=Annual+Report+of+the+Local+Government+Board&pg=PA601 |title=Annual Report of the Local Government Board |date=1895 |publisher=Local Government Board |location=London |page=287 |access-date=18 September 2023 |archive-date=15 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231215214641/https://books.google.com/books?id=gFIwAQAAMAAJ&dq=Annual+Report+of+the+Local+Government+Board&pg=PA601 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The borough was further enlarged in 1913, taking in the rest of Linthorpe and the [[North Ormesby]] area from the parish of Ormesby.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Local Government Board's Provisional Order Confirmation (No. 18) Act 1913 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Geo5/3-4/142/contents/enacted |access-date=19 September 2023 |website=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives |archive-date=1 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230901200153/https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Geo5/3-4/142/contents/enacted |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1932 it gained West Acklam and smaller parts from other parishes when the [[Middlesbrough Rural District]] was abolished.<ref name=VoB/>

In the latter half of the 20th century Middlesbrough was affected by three reforms: in [[Local Government Commission for England (1958–1967)|1968]], Middlesbrough became part of the [[Teesside County Borough]]; in [[Local Government Act 1972|1974]], it became the [[county town]] of the [[Cleveland (county)|Cleveland]] non-metropolitan county until its abolition and in [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|1996]], the [[Borough of Middlesbrough]] became a [[unitary authority]] of [[North Yorkshire]]. In 2011 a [[local enterprise partnership]] was formed from the former Cleveland boroughs and the [[borough of Darlington]] called [[Tees Valley]], in 2016 the area appointed a [[combined authority]] mayor.

===Climate===
Middlesbrough has an [[oceanic climate]] typical for the United Kingdom.
Being sheltered from prevailing south-westerly winds by the [[Lake District]] and [[Pennines]] to the west, and the [[Cleveland Hills]] to the south, Middlesbrough is in one of the relatively dry parts of the country, receiving on average {{convert|574|mm|in|abbr=off}} of rain a year. Temperatures range from mild summer highs in July and August typically around {{convert|21|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, to winter lows in December and January falling to around {{convert|0|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.

Seasonal variations are small and both the mild summers and cool winters are far removed from the average climates of the latitude (54.5°N). This is mainly due to the [[British Isles]] being a relatively small land mass surrounded by water, the mild south-westerly [[Gulf Stream]] air that dominates the British Isles, and the propensity for cloud cover to limit temperature extremes. In nearby [[Scandinavia]], more than ten latitudes farther north, there are coastal [[Bothnian Bay#Climate|Bothnian]] climates with warmer summers than Middlesbrough; and winters in Middlesbrough can be less cold than those at lower latitudes in mainland Europe.

===Former===
In 1875, Bolckow, Vaughan & Co opened the Cleveland Steelworks in Middlesbrough, beginning the transition from iron production to steel and, by the turn of the century, the area had become one of the major steel centres in the country and possibly the world. In 1900, [[Bolckow Vaughan|Bolckow, Vaughan & Co]] had become the largest producer of steel in Great Britain. In 1914, [[Dorman Long]], another major steel producer from Middlesbrough, became the largest company in Britain, employing a workforce of over 20,000, and by 1929 it was the dominant steel producer on Teesside after taking over Bolckow, Vaughan & Co and acquiring its assets. It was possibly the largest steel producer in Britain at the time.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Theory why a Spennymoor church includes a flamboyant 17th Century Spanish altar |url=https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/history/17352632.theory-spennymoor-church-includes-flamboyant-17th-century-spanish-altar/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210817163818/https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/history/17352632.theory-spennymoor-church-includes-flamboyant-17th-century-spanish-altar/ |archive-date=17 August 2021 |access-date=29 November 2020 |website=The Northern Echo}}</ref>

The steel components of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] (1932) were engineered and fabricated by [[Dorman Long]] of Middlesbrough. The company was also responsible for the [[Tyne Bridge|New Tyne Bridge]] in [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Newcastle]].<ref name="DLong201407">{{Cite web |title=Dorman Long Historical Information |url=http://www.dormanlongtechnology.com/en/Dorman%20Long%20historical%20information.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613160341/http://www.dormanlongtechnology.com/en/Dorman%20Long%20historical%20information.htm |archive-date=13 June 2018 |access-date=14 July 2014 |publisher=dormanlongtechnology.com}}</ref>

Several large shipyards also lined the Tees, including the [[Sir Raylton Dixon|Sir Raylton Dixon & Company]], which produced hundreds of steam freighters including the infamous [[SS Mont-Blanc]], the steamship which caused the 1917 [[Halifax Explosion]] in Canada.

The area is still home to the nearby large [[Wilton International|Wilton International industrial site]] which until 1995 was largely owned by [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI). The fragmentation of that company led to smaller manufacturing units being owned by multinational organisations. The last part of ICI itself completely left the area in 2006 and the remaining companies are now members of the [[Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster]] (NEPIC).
