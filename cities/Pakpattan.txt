It is the [[List of most populous cities in Pakistan|48th largest city in Pakistan]] by population according to the 2017 census.

== Etymology ==
Pakpattan was known as ''Ajodhan'' (Hindi अजोधन) until the 16th century.<ref name=c/> The city now derives its name from the combination of two Punjabi words, ''Pak'' and ''Pattan'', meaning "pure," and "dock" respectively, which reference a ferry across the [[Sutlej River]] that was popular with pilgrims to the Shrine of Baba Farid, and represented a metaphorical journey of salvation across the river in a boat piloted by the saint's spirit.<ref name="d">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1ZsBgAAQBAJ&q=pakpattan&pg=PA276|title=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia|last1=Meri|first1=Josef|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135455965|access-date=29 August 2017}}</ref>

==History==
===Early===
Pakpattan was founded as a village by the original Hindu name of ''Ajodhan'' (Hindi अजोधन).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Suvorova|first1=Anna|last2=Suvorova|first2=Professor of Indo-Islamic Culture and Head of Department of Asian Literatures Anna|title=Muslim Saints of South Asia: The Eleventh to Fifteenth Centuries|date=22 July 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134370061|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QK0aLjQtX2cC&q=ajodhan&pg=PA92|access-date=20 April 2017|language=en}}</ref> Ajodhan was the location of a ferry service across the Sutlej river that rendered it an important part of the ancient trade routes connecting [[Multan]] to [[Delhi]].<ref name=c/> Given its position on the flat plains of [[Punjab]], Ajodhan was vulnerable to waves of invasions from Central Asia that began in the late 10th century.<ref name=c/>  It was captured by [[Sebük Tigin|Sebüktegin]] in 977–78 [[Common era|CE]] and by [[Ghaznavids|Ibrahim Ghaznavi]] in 1079–80.<ref name="IGI">[https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V19_338.gif Pakpattan - Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 19, p. 332]</ref>

===Medieval===
Turkish settlers also arrived in the region as a result of pressures from the expanding [[Mongol Empire]],<ref name=c/> and so Ajodhan already had a mosque and Muslim community by the time of the arrival of [[Baba Farid]],<ref name=c>{{cite book|author1=Richard M.

Despite his presence, Ajodhan remained a small town until after his death,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YRXBsoKL7XgC&q=ajodhan|title=Panjab University Research Bulletin: Arts|date=1975|publisher=The University|language=en}}</ref> although it was prosperous given its position on trade routes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEldAgAAQBAJ&q=pakpattan+partition&pg=PA15|title=Khizr Tiwana, the Punjab Unionist Party and the Partition of India|last=Talbot|first=Ian|date=2013-12-16|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136790362|language=en}}</ref>

Baba Farid's establishment of a ''Jama Khana'', or convent, in the town where his devotees would gather for religious instruction is seen as a process of the region's shift away from a [[Hindu]] orientation to a [[Muslim]] one.<ref name="c" /> Large masses of the town's citizenry were noted to gather at the shrine daily in hopes of securing written blessings and amulets from the convent.<ref name="c" />

Upon Baba Farid's death in 1265, a shrine was constructed that eventually contained a mosque, ''langar'', and several other related buildings.<ref name=c/> The shrine was among the first Islamic holy sites in [[South Asia]].<ref name=c/> The shrine later served to elevate the town as a centre of pilgrimage within the wider Islamic world.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-aoYDAAAQBAJ&q=pakpattan&pg=PA25|title=Islamic Sufism Unbound: Politics and Piety in Twenty-First Century Pakistan|last=Rozehnal|first=R.|date=2016-04-30|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780230605725|language=en}}</ref> In keeping with Sufi tradition in Punjab, the shrine maintains influence over smaller shrines throughout the region around Pakpattan that are dedicated to specific events in Baba Farid's life.<ref name="singh">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EPCICwAAQBAJ&q=pakpattan&pg=PT135|title=State Formation and the Establishment of Non-Muslim Hegemony: Post-Mughal 19th-century Punjab|last1=Singh|first1=Rishi|date=2015|publisher=SAGE India|isbn=9789351505044|access-date=29 August 2017}}</ref> These secondary shrines form a ''wilayat'', or a "spiritual territory" of the Pakpattan shrine.<ref name="singh" />

===Mughal===
The town continued to grow as the reputation and influence of the Baba Farid shrine spread, but was also bolstered by its privileged position along the Multan to Delhi trade route.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XL96AAAAMAAJ&q=ajodhan+mughal|title=Mughal India: Studies in Polity, Ideas, Society, and Culture|last=Ali|first=M.

The shrine was extended royal patronage from the Mughal court, while Emperor [[Shah Jahan]] in 1692 bestowed royal support for the shrine's ''Diwan'' chief and descendants of Baba Farid, who eventually formed a class of landowners known as the ''Chistis''. The shrine and ''Chistis'' were defended by an army of devotees drawn from local [[Jat]] clans.<ref name="c" />

===Pakpattan state (1692–1810)===
Following the disintegration of the Mughal Empire, the shrine's ''Diwan'' was able to forge a political independent state centered on Pakpattan.<ref name=c/> In 1757, the territory of the Pakpattan state was extended across the Sutlej River after the shrine's head raised an army against the Raja of [[Bikaner]].<ref name=c/> The shrine's army was able to repel a 1776 attack by the Sikh [[Nakai Misl]] state, resulting in the death of the Nakai leader, [[Heera Singh Sandhu]].<ref name=c/>

=== Sikh rule ===
Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] of the [[Sikh Empire]] seized the city in 1810, removing the political autonomy of the Baba Farid shrine's chief.<ref name=c/> He did, however, bestow the shrine with an annual ''nazrana'' allowance of 9,000 rupees, and granted tracts of land to his descendants.<ref name="books.google.com">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EPCICwAAQBAJ&q=pakpattan+mughal&pg=PT135|title=State Formation and the Establishment of Non-Muslim Hegemony: Post-Mughal 19th-century Punjab|last=Singh|first=Rishi|date=2015-04-23|publisher=SAGE Publications India|isbn=9789351505044|language=en}}</ref> By patronizing the shrine, Ranjit Singh increased his legitimacy of a non-Muslim ruler, and helped spread his influence through the network of smaller shrine through the Pakpattan shrine's spiritual ''wilayat'' territory.<ref name="books.google.com"/>

=== British rule ===
Following the establishment of British rule in Punjab after defeating the Sikh Empire, Pakpattan in 1849 was made district headquarters, before it was shifted in 1852, and finally to [[Sahiwal|Montgomery]] (now Sahiwal) in 1856.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pyFuAAAAMAAJ&q=pakpattan+british+1868|title=Punjab: land, history, people|last=Nadiem|first=Ihsan H.|date=2005|publisher=al-Faisal Nashran|isbn=9789695032831|language=en}}</ref> The Pakpattan Municipal Council was established in 1868,<ref name=":1" />  and the population in 1901 was 6,192.

In 1910, the [[Lodhran–Khanewal Branch Line]] was laid, making Pakpattan an important stop before the railway was dismantled and shipped to [[Iraq]].<ref name=":1" /> In the 1940s, Pakpattan became a centre for [[Muslim League (Pakistan)|Muslim League]] politics, as the shrine granted the League privileges to address crows at the urs fair in 1945 - a favour not granted to pro-Unionist parties.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEldAgAAQBAJ&q=pakpattan&pg=PA15|title=Khizr Tiwana, the Punjab Unionist Party and the Partition of India|last=Talbot|first=Ian|date=2013-12-16|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136790362|language=en}}</ref> The shrine's [[Sajjada nashin|''sajjada nasheen'']] caretakers further refused to sign an anti-Partition manifesto brought to them by pro-Unionists.<ref name=":2" />

=== Partition (1947) ===
Just prior to the [[Partition of India|partition of 1947]], the city's population included a substantial number of Hindus and Sikhs.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book |last=Ahmed |first=Ishtiaq |title=The Punjab Bloodied, Partitioned and Cleansed: Unravelling the 1947 Tragedy through Secret British Reports and First-Person Accounts |publisher=Rupa Publ iCat Ions India |year=2022 |isbn=978-9355205780 |location=India |pages=510–511 |language=English}}</ref><ref name=":5">{{Cite web |title=Our History Old City |url=https://pakpattan.punjab.gov.pk/our-history |access-date=December 3, 2023}}</ref> Some well-known local residents at the time included Bhasheshar Nath (a major landowner), Dr. Ram Nath (MBBS doctor), and Lala Ganpat Rai Dhawan (local businessman and patwari).

=== Modern ===
Pakpattan's demography was radically altered by the Partition of British Raj, with the vast majority of its Sikh and Hindu residents migrating to India. Several ''Chisti'' scholars and notable families also settled in the city, having fled from regions that were allocated to India. Pakpattan thus increased in importance as a religious centre, and witnessed the development of ''pir-muridi'' shrine culture.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6bVUCwAAQBAJ&q=pakpattan+partition&pg=PA130|title=Devotional Islam in Contemporary South Asia: Shrines, Journeys and Wanderers|last1=Boivin|first1=Michel|last2=Delage|first2=Remy|date=2015-12-22|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317380009|language=en}}</ref> The influence of the shrine's caretakers grew as ''Chistis'' and their devotees congregated in the city to such a degree that the shrine caretakers are regarded as "kingmakers" for local and regional politics.<ref name=":3" /> Pakpattan's shrine continued to grow in influence as Pakistani Muslims found it increasingly difficult to visit other ''Chisti'' shrines that now lay in India,<ref name=":3" /> while Sikhs in India commemorate Baba Farid's urs ''in absentia'' at [[Amritsar]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/spectrum/arts/celebrating-urs-in-amritsar/426270.html|title=Celebrating Urs in Amritsar|work=The Tribune}}</ref> Pakpattan continues to be a major pilgrimage centre, drawing up to 2 million annual visitors its large ''urs'' festival.<ref name=":0" />

==Demographics==
[[File:Sahara City Housing Scheme.jpg|thumb|Sahara City Housing Scheme]]
According to the [[1998 Pakistan Census]], the population of Pakpattan city was recorded as 109,033. As per [[2017 Census of Pakistan]], the population of city was recorded as 176,693 with an increase of 62.05% in just 19 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Pakistan-100T.html|title=Pakistan: Provinces and Major Cities - Population Statistics, Maps, Charts, Weather and Web Information|website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref>

== Dhakki (old city) area ==
Pakpattan’s landmark ancient Dhakki (meaning a mound, small hill, or high place) lies at an elevated level; the city was first established here and then expanded outward.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web |last=Chishti |first=Ahmad |date=December 3, 2023 |title=Pakpattan Dhakki Ancient & Historical City of Punjab |website=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O4lOeW5SrA |access-date=December 3, 2023}}</ref><ref name=":5" /> This area is filled with history as it is thousands of years old.<ref name=":5" /> The Dhakki is filled with narrow, crooked streets and had six large doors or gates that closed at nighttime; only a few still stand today.<ref name=":5" /> The area also contains a wall remnant of the "Kacha Burj," a defensive fort built by [[Sher Shah Suri]], who after conquering the city in 1541, commissioned his general Haibat Khan to construct it in order to keep an eye on invaders.<ref name=":6" /><ref>{{Cite web |date=December 3, 2023 |title=Historical places in Pakpattan Kacha Burj Dhaki |website=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lgsmljk9EM |access-date=December 3, 2023}}</ref>

Prior to the 1947 partition, the Dhakki was inhabited by nearly all Hindu families, particularly Khatris, including the Dhawan, Handa, and Chopra families. Several pre-partition houses still stand in the Dhakki today. Just at the foot of the Dakki is an area called Smadhan Walla Mohalla, which contained many "smadhs" of the Hindus before partition. The public college of Pakpattan, Govt. Faridia Graduate College, Pakpattan stands at the very place where once iconic and historic samadhs stood. The remains of pond (deep place with stairs) still stand intact.
The old havelis of the hindus and sikhs still remind us the pre-partition era when the diverse communities lived together in this ancient city. Havrlies of Bashishar Nath, Boota Ram Bhawan, Dr Ram Nath's haveli are among the many mansions which reveal the diversity of prepartition era. 
The iconic building of Railway Station reminds us the colonial era in India. The station is surrounded by scores of other buildings like officers' houses and flats, hospital, rest house etc. 

The Dhakki area is the site of the famous Shrine of Baba Farid.

==Shrine of Baba Farid==
[[File:Darbar Hazrat Baba Farid ud Deen Ganj Shakar Rahmatullah Alaih - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Shrine of Baba Farid]]
The [[Shrine of Baba Farid]] is one of Pakistan's most revered shrines. Built in the town that was known in medieval times as ''Ajodhan'', the old town's importance was eclipsed by that of the shrine, as evidenced by its renaming to "Pakpattan," meaning "Holy Ferry" - referencing a river crossing made by pilgrims to the shrine.<ref name=a/> The shrine has since been a key factor shaping Pakpattan's economy, and the city's politics.
