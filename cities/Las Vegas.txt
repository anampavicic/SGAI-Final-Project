Las Vegas was settled in 1905 and officially incorporated in 1911. At the close of the 20th century, it was the most populated North American city founded within that century (a similar distinction was earned by [[Chicago]] in the 19th century). Population growth has accelerated since the 1960s and into the 21st century, and between 1990 and 2000 the population nearly doubled, increasing by 85.2%. As with most major metropolitan areas, the name of the primary city ("Las Vegas" in this case) is often used to describe areas beyond official city limits. In the case of Las Vegas, this especially applies to the areas on and near the Strip, which are actually in the unincorporated communities of [[Paradise, Nevada|Paradise]] and [[Winchester, Nevada|Winchester]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Vegas not alone in wanting in on .vegas |first=Joe |last=Schoenmann |author-link=Joe Schoenmann |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]] |date=February 3, 2010 |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/feb/03/vegas-not-alone-wanting-vegas/ |access-date=April 5, 2011 |archive-date=August 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829055814/http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/feb/03/vegas-not-alone-wanting-vegas/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |title=Clark County 100 in 2009,Announces Plans |url=https://files.clarkcountynv.gov/clarknv/Parks%20&%20Recreation/Museum/Clark%20County%20Museum/Centennial/news/news-cc100in2009announcesplans.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220528143146/https://files.clarkcountynv.gov/clarknv/Parks%20&%20Recreation/Museum/Clark%20County%20Museum/Centennial/news/news-cc100in2009announcesplans.pdf |archive-date=May 28, 2022 |url-status=live |publisher=[[Clark County, Nevada]] |date=October 22, 2008 |access-date=May 28, 2022|quote=The Las Vegas Strip is in unincorporated Clark County and not in any city.}}</ref>

Eleven years later, members of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] chose Las Vegas as the site to build a fort halfway between [[Salt Lake City]] and Los Angeles, where they would travel to gather supplies. The fort was abandoned several years afterward. The remainder of this [[Old Las Vegas Mormon Fort State Historic Park|Old Mormon Fort]] can still be seen at the intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Washington Avenue.

Las Vegas was founded as a city in 1905, when {{convert|110|acre}} of land adjacent to the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] tracks were auctioned in what would become the downtown area. In 1911, Las Vegas was incorporated as a city.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://dwgateway.library.unr.edu/keck/histtopoNV/Origin_of_Place_Names_Files/1941NevadaOriginofNames-pt1.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409171723/http://dwgateway.library.unr.edu/keck/histtopoNV/Origin_of_Place_Names_Files/1941NevadaOriginofNames-pt1.pdf |archive-date=April 9, 2018  |url-status=live |title=Origin of Place Names: Nevada |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |author=Federal Writers' Project |year=1941 |page=16}}</ref>

The year 1931 was pivotal for Las Vegas. At that time, Nevada legalized casino gambling and reduced residency requirements for divorce to six weeks. This year also witnessed the beginning of construction on nearby [[Hoover Dam]]. The influx of construction workers and their families helped Las Vegas avoid economic calamity during the [[Great Depression]]. The construction work was completed in 1935.

In late 1941, [[Nellis Air Force Base#History|Las Vegas Army Airfield]] was established. Renamed [[Nellis Air Force Base]] in 1950, it is now home to the [[United States Air Force Thunderbirds]] aerobatic team.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://afthunderbirds.com/site/| access-date=October 25, 2019| title=Home| website=United States Air Force Thunderbirds| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191020032655/http://afthunderbirds.com/site/| archive-date=October 20, 2019| url-status=dead}}</ref>

Following World War II, lavishly decorated hotels, gambling casinos, and big-name entertainment became synonymous with Las Vegas.

In 1951, [[nuclear weapons testing]] began at the [[Nevada Test Site]], {{convert|65|mi}} northwest of Las Vegas. During this time, the city was nicknamed the [[History of Las Vegas#Atomic testing|"Atomic City"]]. Residents and visitors were able to witness the mushroom clouds (and were exposed to the fallout) until 1963 when the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] required that nuclear tests be moved underground.<ref name=simon/>

In 1955, the [[Moulin Rouge Hotel]] opened and became the first racially integrated casino-hotel in Las Vegas.

[[File:Las vegas late 60s.png|thumb|left|[[Fremont Street]] in the late 1960s]]
During the 1960s, corporations and business tycoons such as [[Howard Hughes]] were building and buying hotel-casino properties. Gambling was referred to as "gaming", which transitioned it into a legitimate business. ''[[Learning from Las Vegas]]'', published during this era, asked architects to take inspiration from the city's highly decorated buildings, helping to start the [[postmodern architecture]] movement.

In 1995, the [[Fremont Street Experience]] opened in Las Vegas's downtown area. This canopied five-block area features 12.5&nbsp;million LED lights and 550,000 watts of sound from dusk until midnight during shows held at the top of each hour.

Due to the realization of many revitalization efforts, 2012 was dubbed "The Year of Downtown". Projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars made their debut at this time, including the [[Smith Center for the Performing Arts]], the [[Discovery Children's Museum|DISCOVERY Children's Museum]], the [[Mob Museum]], the [[Neon Museum]], a [[Las Vegas City Hall|new City Hall]] complex, and renovations for a new [[Zappos|Zappos.com]] corporate headquarters in the [[Las Vegas City Hall (1973)|old City Hall]] building.<ref name="History"/><ref>{{cite news| title=Zappos' new landlord is a familiar face| url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/zappos-new-landlord-is-a-familiar-face-2158031/| first1=Eli| last1=Segall| author2=Subrina Hudson| newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal| date=October 22, 2020| access-date=December 18, 2020| archive-date=November 28, 2020| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201128101315/https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/zappos-new-landlord-is-a-familiar-face-2158031/| url-status=live}}</ref>

The city's elevation is approximately {{convert|2030|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, though the surrounding peaks reach elevations of over {{convert|10000|ft}} and act as barriers to the strong flow of moisture from the surrounding area. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has an area of {{convert|135.86|sqmi|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|135.81|sqmi|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|0.05|sqmi|abbr=on}} (0.03%) is water.

After Alaska and California, Nevada is the third most seismically active state in the U.S. It has been estimated by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) that over the next 50 years, there is a 10–20% chance of an M6.0 or greater earthquake occurring within {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} of Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://data.nbmg.unr.edu/Public/freedownloads/misc/Presentations/earthquakes/lossestimationmodeling23feb06.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910054050/http://data.nbmg.unr.edu/Public/freedownloads/misc/Presentations/earthquakes/lossestimationmodeling23feb06.pdf |archive-date=September 10, 2015  |url-status=live |title=Loss-Estimation Modeling of Earthquake Scenarios for Each County in Nevada Using HAZUS-MH |page=65 |date=February 23, 2006 |website=Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology |publisher=Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology/University of Nevada, Reno |access-date=March 27, 2016 |quote="Probability of an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 or greater occurring within 50 km in 50 years (from USGS probabilistic seismic hazard analysis) 10–20% chance for Las Vegas area, magnitude 6".}}</ref>

Within the city are many lawns, trees, and other greenery. Due to water resource issues, there has been a movement to encourage [[Xeriscaping|xeriscapes]]. Another part of conservation efforts is scheduled watering days for residential landscaping. A [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] grant in 2008 funded a program that analyzed and forecast growth and environmental effects through 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-04-06 |title=Las Vegas Xeriscaping & Desert Landscaping Tips - Modern Landscape Las Vegas |url=https://www.modernlandscapelasvegas.com/las-vegas-xeriscaping-tips/ |access-date=2024-08-15 |language=en-US}}</ref>

Las Vegas has a [[subtropical climate|subtropical]] [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''BWh''), typical of the [[Mojave Desert]] in which it lies. This climate is typified by long, extremely hot summers; warm transitional seasons; and short winters with mild days and cool nights. There is abundant sunshine throughout the year, with an average of 310 sunny days and bright sunshine during 86% of all daylight hours.<ref name = "NOWData NWS Las Vegas, NV (VEF) - LASthr"/><ref name= noaasun/> Rainfall is scarce, with an average of {{convert|4.2|in|abbr=on}} dispersed between roughly 26 total rainy days per year.<ref name = "NCEI Summary of Monthly Normals - 1991-2020"/> Las Vegas is among the sunniest, driest, and least humid locations in North America, with exceptionally low dew points and humidity that sometimes remains below 10%.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/US/low-humidity-cities.php |title=Cities With Low Humidity in the USA |last=Osborn |first=Liz |website=Current Results |access-date=December 18, 2020 |archive-date=October 19, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019000628/https://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/US/low-humidity-cities.php |url-status=live }}</ref>

The summer months of June through September are extremely hot, though moderated by the low humidity levels. July is the hottest month, with an average daytime high of {{convert|104.5|°F|1}}. On average, 137 days per year reach or exceed {{convert|90|°F}}, of which 78 days reach {{convert|100|°F|0}} and 10 days reach {{convert|110|°F|0}}. During the peak intensity of summer, overnight lows frequently remain above {{convert|80|°F|0}}, and occasionally above {{convert|85|°F|0}}.<ref name="NOWData NWS Las Vegas, NV (VEF) - LASthr" />

While most summer days are consistently hot, dry, and cloudless, the [[North American Monsoon]] sporadically interrupts this pattern and brings more cloud cover, thunderstorms, lightning, increased humidity, and brief spells of heavy rain. Potential monsoons affect Las Vegas between July and August. Summer in Las Vegas is marked by significant [[diurnal temperature variation]]. While less extreme than other parts of the state, nighttime lows in Las Vegas are often {{convert|30|F-change|1}} or more lower than daytime highs.<ref>{{cite thesis |title=Observed and Simulated Urban Heat Island and Urban Cool Island in Las Vegas |url=https://scholarworks.unr.edu/bitstream/handle/11714/2409/Sauceda_unr_0139M_11689.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y |first=Daniel O. |last=Sauceda |date=December 2014 |publisher=[[University of Nevada, Reno]] |access-date=December 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113062612/https://scholarworks.unr.edu/bitstream/handle/11714/2409/Sauceda_unr_0139M_11689.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y |archive-date=November 13, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> The average hottest night of the year is {{convert|90|F|C}}.

Las Vegas winters are relatively short, with typically mild daytime temperatures and chilly nights. Sunshine is abundant in all seasons. December is both the year's coolest and cloudiest month, with an average daytime high of {{convert|56.9|°F|1}} and sunshine occurring during 78% of its daylight hours. Winter evenings are defined by clear skies and swift drops in temperature after sunset, with overnight minima averaging around {{convert|40|°F|1}} in December and January. Owing to its elevation that ranges from {{convert|2,000|to|3,000|ft}}, Las Vegas experiences markedly cooler winters than other areas of the [[Mojave Desert]] and the adjacent [[Sonoran Desert]] that are closer to sea level. The city records freezing temperatures an average of 10 nights per winter.

Most of the annual precipitation falls during the winter. February, the wettest month, averages only four days of measurable rain.

The U.S. Census accounts for race by two methodologies. "Race alone" and "Race alone less Hispanics" where Hispanics are delineated separately as if a separate race.

According to the [[2020 U.S. Census]], the racial makeup (including Hispanics in the racial counts) was 46.05% (295,594) [[White (U.S. Census)|White alone]], 12.85% (82,485) [[African American (U.S. Census)|Black alone]], 1.14% (7,318) [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American alone]], 7.23% (46,398) [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian alone]], 0.73% (4,662) [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander alone]], 16.99% (109,045) [[Race (United States Census)|Other Race alone]], and 15.02% (96,401) [[Multiracial Americans|Multiracial or Mixed Race]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=P1: Race – 2020: DEC Redistricting Data (PL 94-171) – Las Vegas city, Nevada|url=https://data.census.gov/table/DECENNIALPL2020.P1?q=p2&g=160XX00US3240000|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]}}</ref>

According to research by demographer [[William H. Frey]], using data from the [[2010 United States Census]], Las Vegas has the second-lowest level of black-white segregation of any of the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, after [[Tucson, Arizona]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Frey |first1=William H. |title=Diversity Explosion: How New Racial Demographics Are Remaking America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JHUzDwAAQBAJ&q=las+vegasl%3D |date=July 24, 2018 |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-8157-2398-1 |page=177 |edition=Second |access-date=December 18, 2020}}</ref>

As of 2006, there were 176,750 households, of which 31.9% had children under age 18 living with them, 48.3% were married couples living together, 12.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.5% were non-families. 25.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.66 and the average family size was 3.20.

Since divorce is easier in Nevada than in most other states, many people come from across the country for the easier process. Similarly, Nevada marriages are notoriously easy to get. Las Vegas has one of the highest marriage rates of U.S. cities, with many licenses issued to people from outside the area (see [[Las Vegas weddings]]).

==Economy==
The primary drivers of the Las Vegas economy are tourism, [[Downtown (Nevada gaming area)|gaming]], and conventions, which in turn feed the retail and restaurant industries.

===Tourism===
[[File:Golden Nugget 2008.jpg|thumb|The [[Golden Nugget Las Vegas]]]]

[[File:Las Vegas at night (9118927988).jpg|thumb|A view of the [[Las Vegas Valley]] looking north from the [[Stratosphere Tower]]]]
The major attractions in Las Vegas are the casinos and the hotels, although in recent years other new attractions have begun to emerge.

Most casinos in the downtown area are on [[Fremont Street]], with [[Stratosphere Las Vegas|The STRAT Hotel, Casino & Skypod]] as one of the few exceptions. [[Fremont East]], adjacent to the Fremont Street Experience, was granted variances to allow bars to be closer together, similar to the [[Gaslamp Quarter]] of San Diego, the goal being to attract a different demographic than the Strip attracts.

====Downtown casinos====
{{Main|Downtown (Nevada gaming area)}}
The [[Golden Gate Hotel and Casino]], downtown along the Fremont Street Experience, is the oldest continuously operating hotel and casino in Las Vegas; it opened in 1906 as the Hotel Nevada.

In 1931, the [[Northern Club (casino)|Northern Club]] (now the [[La Bayou]]) opened.<ref name=lvrj20000727>{{cite news |first=Heidi Knapp |last=Rinella |title=New book raises questions about Silver State |newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal |date=July 27, 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.a2zlasvegas.com/fse/fse01.html |title=Fremont Street Experience Brings Downtown Las Vegas into Next Century |access-date=December 8, 2008 |publisher=[[Fremont Street Experience]] |archive-date=March 10, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310095204/http://www.a2zlasvegas.com/fse/fse01.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> The most notable of the early casinos may have been [[Binion's Horseshoe]] (now [[Binion's Gambling Hall and Hotel]]) while it was run by [[Benny Binion]].

[[Boyd Gaming]] has a major presence downtown operating the [[California Hotel & Casino]], the [[Fremont Hotel & Casino]], and the [[Main Street Casino]]. The [[Four Queens]] also operates downtown along the Fremont Street Experience.

Downtown casinos that have undergone major renovations and revitalization in recent years include the [[Golden Nugget Las Vegas]], [[The D Las Vegas]] (formerly Fitzgerald's), the [[Downtown Grand|Downtown Grand Las Vegas]] (formerly Lady Luck), the [[El Cortez (Las Vegas)|El Cortez Hotel & Casino]], and the [[Plaza Hotel & Casino]].<ref>2013 Fiscal Year in Review, city of Las Vegas Economic and Urban Development Projects, "A New Downtown Emerges."</ref>

In 1959, the {{Convert|25|ft|m|-tall|adj=mid}} [[Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign]] was installed at the south end of the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. A replica welcome sign, standing nearly {{Convert|16|ft|m}} tall, was installed within city limits in 2002, at [[Las Vegas Boulevard]] and Fourth Street.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Other Las Vegas |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2002/Dec-04-Wed-2002/news/20202414.html |work=Las Vegas Review-Journal |date=December 4, 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050908080804/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2002/Dec-04-Wed-2002/news/20202414.html |archive-date=September 8, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/13/garden/13VEGA.html| title=A Neon Come-Hither, Still Able to Flirt| newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Patricia Leigh |last=Brown |date=January 13, 2005 |access-date=December 18, 2020 |url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Ask Mr. Sun: The Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/nov/25/ask-mr-sun/ |access-date=December 11, 2023 |work=Las Vegas Sun |date=November 25, 2008 |archive-date=March 23, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210323170426/https://lasvegassun.com/news/2008/nov/25/ask-mr-sun/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The replica was destroyed in 2016, when a pickup truck crashed into it.<ref>{{cite news |last=Michor |first=Max |title='Welcome to Fabulous Downtown Las Vegas' sign destroyed by truck |url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/welcome-to-fabulous-downtown-las-vegas-sign-destroyed-by-truck/ |access-date=December 11, 2023 |work=Las Vegas Review-Journal |date=July 17, 2016 |archive-date=December 11, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231211183731/https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/welcome-to-fabulous-downtown-las-vegas-sign-destroyed-by-truck/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2018, the city approved plans for a new gateway landmark in the form of neon arches. It was built within city limits, in front of the [[The Strat|Strat]] resort and north of [[Sahara Avenue]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Akers |first=Mick |title=Neon arches to welcome visitors to downtown Las Vegas |url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2018/may/18/neon-arches-to-welcome-visitors-to-downtown-las-ve/ |access-date=December 11, 2023 |work=Las Vegas Sun |date=May 18, 2018}}</ref> The project, built by [[YESCO]], cost $6.5&nbsp;million and stands {{Convert|80|ft|m}} high.<ref>{{cite news |last=Akers |first=Mick |title=Downtown Las Vegas gateway arch construction to start this month |url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/downtown/downtown-las-vegas-gateway-arch-construction-to-start-this-month-1970233/ |access-date=December 11, 2023 |work=Las Vegas Review-Journal |date=March 2, 2020}}</ref> Officially known as the Gateway Arches, the project was completed in 2020.

Also located just north of the Strat are a pair of giant neon showgirls, initially added in 2018 as part of a $400,000 welcome display.

===Development===
{{See also|List of tallest buildings in Las Vegas}}
When [[The Mirage]] opened in 1989, it started a trend of major resort development on the Las Vegas Strip outside of the city. This resulted in a drop in tourism in the downtown area, but many recent projects have increased the number of visitors to downtown.

An effort has been made by city officials to diversify the economy by attracting health-related, high-tech and other commercial interests. No state tax for individuals or corporations, as well as a lack of other forms of business-related taxes, have aided the success of these efforts.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://lvrda.org/| title=Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency| website=City of Las Vegas| access-date=December 18, 2020| archive-date=May 4, 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504162022/http://lvrda.org/| url-status=live}}</ref>

The Fremont Street Experience was built in an effort to draw tourists back to the area and has been popular since its startup in 1995.

The city purchased {{convert|61|acre}} of property from the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] in 1995 with the goal of creating a better draw for more people to the downtown area. In 2004, Las Vegas Mayor [[Oscar Goodman]] announced plans for [[Symphony Park]], which could include a mixture of offerings, such as residential space and office buildings.

Already operating in Symphony Park is the Cleveland Clinic [[Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health]] (opened in 2010), [[The Smith Center for the Performing Arts]] (opened in 2012) and the DISCOVERY Children's Museum (opened in 2013).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://downtown.vegas/work/neighborhoods-districts/symphony-park/ |title=Symphony Park, Las Vegas |date=June 18, 2014 |publisher=Las Vegas Economic and Urban Development Agency |access-date=April 8, 2016 |archive-date=April 15, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415071310/http://downtown.vegas/work/neighborhoods-districts/symphony-park/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[File:World Market Center - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|[[World Market Center Las Vegas|World Market Center]] Building A]]
On land across from Symphony Park, the [[World Market Center]] Las Vegas opened in 2005. It currently encompasses three large buildings with a total of 5.1&nbsp;million square feet. Trade shows for the furniture and furnishing industries are held there semiannually.

Also nearby is the Las Vegas North Premium Outlets. With a second expansion, completed in May 2015, the mall currently offers 175 stores.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.premiumoutlets.com/lasvegas |title=Premium Outlets: Las Vegas |website=[[Simon Property Group]] |access-date=September 13, 2014 |archive-date=October 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012111451/http://www.premiumoutlets.com/lasvegas/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

City offices moved to a new [[Las Vegas City Hall]] in February 2013 on downtown's Main Street. The former City Hall building is now occupied by the corporate headquarters for the online retailer [[Zappos.com]], which opened downtown in 2013. Zappos CEO [[Tony Hsieh]] took an interest in the urban area and contributed $350&nbsp;million toward a revitalization effort called the Downtown Project.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.downtownproject.com| title=Downtown Project – Revitalizing Downtown Las Vegas| website=Downtownproject.com| access-date=September 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title=What Happens in Brooklyn Moves to Vegas| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/magazine/what-happens-in-brooklyn-moves-to-vegas.html| first=Timothy| last=Pratt| date=October 19, 2012| access-date=December 18, 2020| url-access=subscription| journal=[[The New York Times Magazine]]}}</ref> Projects funded include Las Vegas's first independent bookstore, [[The Writer's Block]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://knpr.org/knpr/2014-12/despite-e-books-independent-bookstore-gambling-downtown-las-vegas |title=Despite E-Books, Independent Bookstore Gambling on Downtown Las Vegas |first=Chris |last=Sieroty |publisher=[[KNPR]] News |access-date=December 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530082035/http://knpr.org/knpr/2014-12/despite-e-books-independent-bookstore-gambling-downtown-las-vegas |archive-date=May 30, 2015}}</ref>

===Other industries===

A number of new industries have moved to Las Vegas in recent decades. [[Zappos.com]] (now an [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] subsidiary) was founded in San Francisco but by 2013 had moved its headquarters to downtown Las Vegas. [[Allegiant Air]], a low-cost air carrier, launched in 1997 with its first hub at [[Harry Reid International Airport]] and headquarters in nearby Summerlin.

[[Planet 13 Holdings]], a cannabis company, opened the world's largest [[Cannabis shop|cannabis dispensary]] in Las Vegas at {{cvt|112,000|sqft|m2}}.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/02/planet-13-worlds-largest-cannabis-dispensary-opens-in-las-vegas.html| title=The world's largest cannabis dispensary just opened in Vegas—and it has an entertainment complex attached| last=Im| first=Jimmy| date=November 3, 2018| website=[[CNBC]]| language=en| access-date=June 25, 2019| archive-date=June 24, 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190624135908/https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/02/planet-13-worlds-largest-cannabis-dispensary-opens-in-las-vegas.html| url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/15/18096082/planet-13-marijuana-dispensary-las-vegas-luxury-marketing-branding-cannabis| title=We visited the world's largest cannabis dispensary| last=Chen| first=Angela| date=November 15, 2018| journal=[[The Verge]]| access-date=December 18, 2020| archive-date=June 24, 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190624135911/https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/15/18096082/planet-13-marijuana-dispensary-las-vegas-luxury-marketing-branding-cannabis| url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Effects of growth on water supply ===
A growing population means the Las Vegas Valley used {{convert|1.2|e9USgal|e9L|abbr=unit}} more water in 2014 than in 2011. Although water conservation efforts implemented in the wake of a 2002 drought have had some success, local [[Water footprint|water consumption]] remains 30&nbsp;percent greater than in Los Angeles, and over three times that of San Francisco metropolitan area residents. The [[Southern Nevada Water Authority]] is building a $1.4&nbsp;billion tunnel and pumping station to bring water from [[Lake Mead]], has purchased water rights throughout Nevada, and has planned a controversial $3.2&nbsp;billion [[Water transportation|pipeline]] across half the state. By law, the Las Vegas Water Service District "may deny any request for a water commitment or request for a water connection if the District has an inadequate supply of water." But limiting growth on the basis of an inadequate water supply has been unpopular with the casino and building industries.<ref name=":0" />

==Government==
{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}
[[File:Lasvegasnewcityhall.jpg|thumb|[[Las Vegas City Hall]] in downtown Las Vegas]]
The city of Las Vegas has a [[council–manager government]]. The mayor sits as a council member-at-large and presides over all [[city council]] meetings. If the mayor cannot preside over a City Council meeting, then the Mayor Pro-Tem is the [[Chairman|presiding officer]] of the meeting until the Mayor returns to his/her seat. The City Manager is responsible for the administration and the day-to-day operations of all [[municipal services]] and city departments. The City Manager maintains intergovernmental relationships with federal, state, county and other local governments.

Much of the Las Vegas metropolitan area is split into neighboring incorporated cities or unincorporated communities. Approximately 700,000 people live in unincorporated areas governed by [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]], and another 465,000 live in incorporated cities such as [[North Las Vegas, Nevada|North Las Vegas]], [[Henderson, Nevada|Henderson]] and [[Boulder City, Nevada|Boulder City]]. Las Vegas and Clark County share a police department, the [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department]], which was formed after a 1973 merger of the [[Las Vegas Police Department (Nevada)|Las Vegas Police Department]] and the [[Clark County Sheriff's Department (Nevada)|Clark County Sheriff's Department]]. North Las Vegas, Henderson, Boulder City and some colleges have their own police departments.

A [[Southern Paiute|Paiute]] [[Indian reservation]] occupies about {{convert|1|acre}} in the downtown area.

Las Vegas, home to the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada#Las Vegas|Lloyd D. George Federal District Courthouse]] and the Regional Justice Center, draws numerous companies providing bail, marriage, divorce, tax, [[incorporation (business)|incorporation]] and other legal services.

The [[Union Pacific Railroad]] is the only [[Class I railroad]] providing rail freight service to the city. Until 1997, the Amtrak ''Desert Wind'' train service ran through Las Vegas using the Union Pacific Railroad tracks.

In March 2010, the RTC launched [[bus rapid transit]] link in Las Vegas called the ''Strip & Downtown Express'' with limited stops and frequent service that connects downtown Las Vegas, the Strip and the Las Vegas Convention Center. Shortly after the launch, the RTC dropped the ''ACE'' name.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/aug/17/lawsuit-prompts-rtc-drop-ace-name-bus-lines/ |title=Lawsuit prompts RTC to drop 'ACE' name from bus lines |last=Green |first=Steve |date=August 17, 2011 |newspaper=Las Vegas Sun |access-date=March 1, 2011 |archive-date=December 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209172320/http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/aug/17/lawsuit-prompts-rtc-drop-ace-name-bus-lines/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

With some exceptions, including [[Las Vegas Boulevard]], [[Nevada State Route 582|Boulder Highway (SR 582)]] and [[Nevada State Route 599|Rancho Drive (SR 599)]], the majority of surface streets in Las Vegas are laid out in a grid along [[Public Land Survey System]] [[section line]]s. Many are maintained by the [[Nevada Department of Transportation]] as [[state highway]]s. The street numbering system is divided by the following streets:

* Westcliff Drive, [[U.S. Route 95 in Nevada|US 95 Expressway]], [[Fremont Street]] and [[Charleston Boulevard]] divide the north–south block numbers from west to east.
* [[Las Vegas Boulevard]] divides the east–west streets from the [[Las Vegas Strip]] to near the Stratosphere, then Main Street becomes the dividing line from the Stratosphere to the North Las Vegas border, after which the Goldfield Street alignment divides east and west.
* On the east side of Las Vegas, block numbers between [[Charleston Boulevard]] and Washington Avenue are different along Nellis Boulevard, which is the eastern border of the city limits.

Interstates 15, 11, and US 95 lead out of the city in four directions. Two major freeways – [[Interstate 15 in Nevada|Interstate 15]] and [[Interstate 11]]/[[U.S. Route 95 (Nevada)|U.S. Route 95]] – cross in downtown Las Vegas. I-15 connects Las Vegas to Los Angeles, and heads northeast to and beyond Salt Lake City. I-11 goes northwest to the [[Las Vegas Tribe of Paiute Indians of the Las Vegas Indian Colony|Las Vegas Paiute Indian Reservation]] and southeast to [[Henderson, Nevada|Henderson]] and to the [[Mike O'Callaghan–Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge]], where from this point I-11 will eventually continue along [[US 93 (NV)|US 93]] towards [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. US 95 (and eventually I-11) connects the city to northwestern Nevada, including [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]] and [[Reno, NV|Reno]]. US 93 splits from I-15 northeast of Las Vegas and goes north through the eastern part of the state, serving [[Ely, Nevada|Ely]] and [[Wells, Nevada|Wells]]. US 95 heads south from US 93 near Henderson through far eastern California. A [[Las Vegas Beltway|partial beltway]] has been built, consisting of [[Interstate 215 (Nevada)|Interstate 215]] on the south and [[Clark County 215]] on the west and north. Other radial routes include [[SR 160 (NV)|Blue Diamond Road (SR 160)]] to [[Pahrump, Nevada|Pahrump]] and [[SR 147 (NV)|Lake Mead Boulevard (SR 147)]] to [[Lake Mead]].
