In 1891, the Qing Empire decided to make coastal Qingdao (then known as "Jiao'ao") a defense base against naval attacks and began to improve its fortifications. [[German Empire|Imperial German]] naval officials observed and reported on this activity during a formal survey of [[Jiaozhou Bay]] in May 1897. In November of that year, the [[Juye Incident]] would take place, in which three German missionaries were attacked, and two were killed. Subsequently, German troops seized and occupied the fortification.<ref>{{cite book |title=By Order of the Kaiser, Otto von Diederichs and the Rise of the Imperial German Navy 1865–1902 |last=Gottschall |first=Terrell |year=2003 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis |isbn=978-1-55750-309-1 |page=146 }}</ref> 

The preindustrial, waning Qing Empire was forced to concede the area to Germany the following year, and the [[Kiautschou Bay concession]], as it became known, existed from 1898 to 1914 (Li 2005, p.&nbsp;81). 

With an area of {{convert|552|km2|acre sqmi|abbr=on}}, it was located in the imperial province of [[Shandong]] ([[Romanization of Chinese|alternately romanized]] as [[Wade-Giles|Shantung or Shan-tung]]) on the southern coast of the [[Shandong]] Peninsula in northern China. Jiaozhou was alternatively romanized as Kiaochow, Kiauchau, or Kiao-Chau in English, and Kiautschou in German; Qingdao was its administrative center. "The so-called ''Marktstrasse'' (Market Street) was nothing more than the old main street of the Chinese village of Qingdao, and the buildings lining it were the former homes of fishermen and farmers.

Identified by the German authorities as a strategically important port, Qingdao was administered by the [[Reichsmarineamt|Imperial Department of the Navy]] (''Reichsmarineamt'') rather than the [[Imperial Colonial Office]] (''Reichskolonialamt''). The growing Imperial German Navy based their [[East Asia Squadron]] there, allowing the warships to conduct operations throughout the western [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. Beginning in January 1898, the marines of ''[[Seebataillon|III. Seebataillon]]'' were based at Qingdao.

Before the outbreak of [[World War I]] (1914–1918), ships of the German naval forces under [[Maximilian von Spee|Admiral Count von Spee]] were located at central Pacific colonies on routine missions. The fleet then rendezvoused in the [[Marianas Islands]] to plan a transit back to Germany rather than be trapped in the Pacific by more powerful and numerous Allied fleets (British and Japanese).{{NoteTag|See [[East Asia Squadron]], [[Battle of Coronel]] and [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]] for fleet engagements.}}

The city came under Chinese rule in December 1922, under control of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (R.O.C.) established in 1912 after the [[Chinese Revolution (1911)|Chinese Revolution]] the year before. However, Japan maintained its economic dominance of the railway and the province as a whole.<ref>Griswold, ''The Far Eastern Policy of the United States'' (1938) pp.&nbsp;326–28.</ref> The city became a [[direct-controlled municipality]] of the ROC Government in July 1929.

Japan re-occupied Qingdao in 1938, a year after it expanded the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–1945), (a precursor to [[World War II]], 1939–1945) with its plans of territorial expansion into China's coast. [[Kuomintang|Nationalist (Kuomintang)]] ROC forces returned after the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] in September 1945. On 2 June 1949, during the [[Chinese Civil War]] and shortly before the founding of the communist [[People's Republic of China]] on 1 October 1949 the city was taken by Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] and his troops.

===Qingdao city planning and development===

====1898–1914====
The development of the Qingdao urban space during the German occupation (1898–1914) originated from the port. Mass urban construction began in 1898 with the relocation of Chinese dwellers along the coast.<ref>{{cite news |title=What is Kiaochou worth? |author=Toyokichi Iyenaga |url=https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/128/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |date=26 October 1914 |access-date=24 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230183553/http://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/128/mode/1up |archive-date=30 December 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> With the completion of such series of mass construction projects such as wharves, the Tsingtao-Jinan Railway Line, Tsingtao Railway Station and locomotive works, a city was starting to take shape.<ref>Schultz-Naumann, p. 182</ref> The area had the highest school density and highest per capita student enrollment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Berlin treasury as well as Protestant and Roman Catholic missions.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schultz-Naumann |first1=Joachim |title=Unter Kaisers Flagge: Deutschlands Schutzgebiete im Pazifik und in China einst und heute |year=1985 |publisher=Universitas |language=de |isbn=978-3-8004-1094-1 |page=183}}</ref> 

In 1910, the Germans drew up for the second time the city planning of Tsingtao (Warner 2001, p.&nbsp;33). The former urban area was extended four times highlighted by the emphasis on the development of commerce and trade. [[Sun Yat-sen]] (1866–1925), leader of the [[Chinese Revolution (1911)|Chinese Revolution of 1911]] and subsequently first president of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], visited the Tsingtao area and stated in 1912, "I am impressed. The city is a true model for China's future".<ref>Schultz-Naumann, p. 184</ref>

====1914–1922====
The development of Tsingtao urban space continued during the first Japan-occupation period (1914–1922). In 1914, Tsingtao was taken over by the Japanese and served as a base for the exploitation of natural resources of Shandong and northern China. With the development of industry and commerce, a "New City District" was established to furnish the Japanese colonists with commercial sections and living quarters, which suggested a striking contrast to the shabby houses in the local Chinese zones (Li 2007, p.&nbsp;133). In the meantime, several schools, hospitals, and public buildings were constructed, followed by urban streets and intercity highways as well. The urban spatial layout continued to expand northward along the east bay area.

====1922–1938====
The development of Tsingtao urban space during the ROC-ruled period (1922–1938). This period saw the substantial progress of the urban development of Tsingtao. The government engaged itself in mass construction that gave birth to villa districts at the beach and bank groups in CBD. Plenty of public buildings and facilities for entertainment and sports were completed. By the year 1937, the urban population numbered 385,000(Lu 2001, p.&nbsp;327). Tsingtao consequently distinguished itself as a prominent holiday resort and summer retreat.

====1938–1945====
The development of Tsingtao urban space during the second Japan-occupied period (1938–1945). Japanese armed forces returned to Tsingtao in 1938 and started to strive for the construction of the Greater Tsingtao in the following June. Accordingly, they worked out the city planning of the Greater Tsingtao and the City Planning of the Mother Town (Tsingtao City Proper), even though they had not had the opportunity to actualize either, respectively. The period in question did not witness much urban progress except for the logical construction of No. 6 Wharf, some Japanese residences, and a small number of roads and streets (Lu 2001, p.&nbsp;339).

===Postwar===
After World War II, the [[Kuomintang|KMT]] allowed Qingdao to serve as the headquarters of the [[United States Seventh Fleet|Western Pacific Fleet]] of the [[US Navy]] in 1945; however, its headquarters were transferred to the [[Philippines]] sometime in late 1948. On 2 June 1949, the [[Communist Party of China|CPC]]-led [[Chinese Red Army|Red Army]] entered Qingdao and the city and province have been under [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] control since that time.

Since the 1984 inauguration of China's open-door policy to foreign trade and investment, Qingdao has rapidly developed into an ultramodern port city. It is now the headquarters of the [[North Sea Fleet|Chinese navy's northern fleet]]. An early example of the open-door policy occurred on 5 November 1984, when three United States Naval vessels visited Qingdao. This was the first US port call to China in more than 37 years. {{USS|Rentz|FFG-46|6}}, {{USS|Reeves|DLG-24|6}}, and {{USS|Oldendorf|DD-972|6}} and their crews were officially hosted by the Chinese [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] (PLAN).

Northern Qingdao, particularly [[Shibei District|Shibei]], [[Licang District|Licang]], and [[Chengyang District|Chengyang]] districts, are now major manufacturing centers. The city has recently experienced a strong growth period, with a new central business district created to the east of the older business district. Outside of the center of the city, there is a large industrial zone, which includes chemical processing, rubber, and heavy manufacturing, in addition to a growing high-tech area. Numerous local and national service companies, rather than manufacturers, are based in the city's southern district.

==Administrative divisions==
[[File:City Hall of Qingdao.jpg|thumb|City Hall of Qingdao]]
The sub-provincial city of Qingdao has seven districts (区; qū) and three county-level cities (市; shì):Qingdao City, located in Shandong Province, China, is a prefecture-level city with several aliases, including "Island City" and "Jiaozhou Bay". Qingdao is a vice-provincial-level city, a separately listed city, and recognized as a major city. 

According to the approval of the State Council, Qingdao is designated as an important coastal center city and a coastal resort tourism city in China, as well as an international port city. Qingdao City administers 7 districts and 3 county-level cities. These districts include Shinan District, Shibei District, Huangdao District, Laoshan District, Licang District, Chengyang District, and Jimo District, while the county-level cities consist of Jiaozhou City, Pingdu City, and Laixi City.

{{Administrative divisions of Qingdao}}
Geographically, there are three districts (Shinan, Shibei, Licang) constituting a peninsula on the east coast of the [[Jiaozhou Bay]] as the core urban area, one (Chengyang) on the north coast and one (Xihai'an) on the west coast of the [[Yellow Sea]].

During the summer months, the beaches of Qingdao are afflicted by massive [[algal bloom]]s. The decomposing algae release large amounts of [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas, which produces an offensive "rotten egg" odor. [[Sea lettuce]] blooms, which are partially caused by [[seaweed farming]] in Jiangsu Province, led local officials to declare a "large-scale algae disaster" in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jacobs|first=Andrew|title=Huge Algae Bloom Afflicts Coastal Chinese City|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/06/world/asia/huge-algae-bloom-afflicts-qingdao-china.html?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=5 July 2013|access-date=5 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709000150/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/06/world/asia/huge-algae-bloom-afflicts-qingdao-china.html?_r=0|archive-date=9 July 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 30 June 2011, the longest bridge over water opened in Qingdao. The bridge, [[Jiaozhou Bay Bridge|Haiwan Bridge]], is {{convert|26.4|mi|1|abbr=out}} long and connects Qingdao to [[Huangdao]] and Hongdao. The bridge is almost three miles ({{convert|3|mi|abbr=out|disp=output only}}) longer than the previous [[List of longest bridges|record-holder]], the [[Lake Pontchartrain Causeway]] in the [[United States|American]] state of [[Louisiana]]. Haiwan Bridge is supported by more than 5,000 pillars and costs about 10 billion yuan which is about 1.5 billion dollars. The bridge was designed by the [[Shandong Gaosu Group|Shandong Gausu Group]] and the construction lasted for four years. Haiwan Bridge cut the commute between the city of Qingdao and the sprawling suburb of Huangdao by 30 minutes. At least 10,000 workers toiled in two teams around the clock to build the bridge, which was constructed from opposite ends.<ref>{{cite news|last=Eimer|first=David|title=China builds world's longest bridge|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8248197/China-builds-worlds-longest-bridge.html|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2013-03-23|location=London|date=8 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506043910/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8248197/China-builds-worlds-longest-bridge.html|archive-date=6 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Architecture===
[[File:Qingdao Zhanqiao.jpg|thumb|right|Qingdao retains many buildings with a German architectural style]]
There are a large number of German-style buildings in Qingdao's [[city center]], a remarkable fact considering the German leased-territory period only lasted 16 years (1898–1914). The unique combination of German and Chinese architecture therein, combined with German demographic roots and a large Korean expatriate population, gives Qingdao a rather distinct atmosphere. An old saying described Qingdao as a city of "red tiles green trees, blue sky, and blue sea." This saying indeed gives a picture of a bird view of Qingdao. A larger number of areas in former foreign styles are well preserved. Although the new city area is under large-scale reconstruction, the old city area (especially the western part of [[Shinan District]]) still retains many traditional buildings.

===Language===
During the city's leased-territory days, [[German language|German]], the official language, was rigorously taught and promoted. Since the demise of Germany's colonial empire after World War I, the German language is all but gone, leaving little impact on the local languages. A local accent known as [[Qingdao dialect]] ({{zh|c=青岛话|p=Qīngdǎo huà}}) distinguishes the residents of the city from those of the surrounding [[Shandong]] province. Due to the efforts by the city government to promote standard [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], most educated people can speak standard Mandarin in addition to their native dialect. With reform policies and English teaching, some young citizens have been taught English and many can converse with English-speaking foreigners. Business and traffic signs in English are becoming more and more common.

===Festivals===
Notable festivals include:
* [[Qingdao International Horticultural Exposition 2014]] is the biggest international fair that has been held in the history of the city.
* [[Qingdao International Beer Festival]] in August/September, held annually since 1991.
