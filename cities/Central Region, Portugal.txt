The '''Central Region''' ({{langx|pt|Região do Centro}}, {{IPA|pt|ʁɨʒiˈɐ̃w du ˈsẽtɾu|IPA}}) or '''Central Portugal''' is one of the [[NUTS statistical regions of Portugal|statistical regions]] of [[Portugal]]. The cities with major administrative status inside this region are [[Coimbra]], [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]], [[Viseu]], [[Leiria]], [[Castelo Branco, Portugal|Castelo Branco]] and [[Guarda, Portugal|Guarda]]. It is one of the seven [[Regions of Portugal]] ([[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS]] II subdivisions). It is also one of the regions of Europe, as given by the [[European Union]] for statistical and [[Geography|geographical]] purposes. Its area totals {{convert|28,462|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. As of 2011, its population totalled 2,327,026 inhabitants,<ref name=INE>{{cite web|title= Censos 2011 Resultados Preliminares 2011| publisher= INE| url= http://www.ine.pt/scripts/flex_v10/Main.html}}</ref> with a population density of 82 inhabitants per square kilometre.

== History ==
[[File:Conimbriga.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The ancient ruins at [[Conímbriga]], the best preserved ruins in the ancient Roman province of [[Lusitania]].]]
Inhabited by the [[Lusitanians]], an [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European people]] living in the western [[Iberian Peninsula]], the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] settled in the region and colonized it as a part of the Roman Province of ''[[Lusitania|Lusitânia]]''. The Roman town of [[Conímbriga]], near [[Coimbra]], is among the most noted and well-preserved remains of that period. After the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], [[Visigoths]] were the main rulers and colonizers from the 5th to the 8th century.

In the 8th century, the [[Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula|Muslim conquest of Iberia]] turned the region a Muslim-dominated territory.

In the earliest years of the Christian ''[[Reconquista]]'', just before the rise of a Portuguese national identity, the region was a battle place between Christian [[Crusades|crusader]]s and Muslim Moors. Once the [[Christians|Christian]] regained control,  kings and landlords made the region a county, called the [[County of Coimbra]]. It was integrated into the newly created ''[[Condado Portucalensis]]'', the early precursor of the modern nation of [[Portugal]].

The modern region matches up roughly with the boundaries of the historical [[Beira, Portugal|Beira Province]]. [[Beira, Portugal|Beira]] was an historical province of Portugal and its name was used by the heirs to the [[Portuguese throne]] during the monarchy period, before 1910. The princes were known as the [[Princes of Beira]].
Since 2024, ''[[Oeste Subregion|Oeste]]'' in historical [[Estremadura Province (1936-1976)|Estremadura]] and ''[[Médio Tejo Subregion|Médio Tejo]]'' in historical [[Ribatejo]] are part of the new [[Administrative divisions of Portugal#NUTS|NUTS II]] [[Oeste e Vale do Tejo|Oeste e Vale do Tejo region]].<ref name=offjrn2023>{{Cite web |title=Official Journal L 87/2023 |url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L:2023:087:FULL&from=EN |access-date=2024-01-13 |website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}</ref> 
[[File:Monsanto April 2015-4.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Monsanto (Idanha-a-Nova)|Monsanto]], known as "the most Portuguese village of Portugal".]]

=== Historic villages ===
Along the region's mountainous border with [[Spain]] are a series of [[Fortification|fortresses]] and [[castle]]s that once protected the country from its many invaders. Over the centuries, Moors, [[Christians]], [[Spaniards]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] have all tried to take these [[village]]s, but their higher elevations usually gave them a distinct advantage. On that border, the more than one dozen fortified frontier villages beckon today's visitors to come explore a 900-year history — full of the heroism, epic battles and romance upon which [[Portugal]] struggled to become a nation. Today, Portugal boasts the longest-standing border in all of [[Europe]].[[File:Caminho Histórico de Sortelha XI (36256126106).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Sortelha]], [[Sabugal]] municipality, the historic town nestled within the rugged hills.]]In these rural border [[village]]s, ancient rituals and religious festivals remain popular. Visitors can sample them and partake in the traditional foods of that area, such as cheese, sausages, and mountain honey.

In the fortress town of [[Almeida, Portugal|Almeida]], a walk through the narrow cobbled streets can lead a visitor to the ruins of a once mighty 12-pointed fortress.  One of Portugal's many ''Pousadas''— an historic property turned into an inn— is located in Almeida.

In the town of Castelo Rodrigo, a memorial stone marks the place of a fierce battle in 1664, and visitors can view the remains of the castle and its [[keep]], as well as a palace. The town also has a small [[Gothic architecture|Gothic church]]. Near Castelo Mendo stands an intricate stone bridge built by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]].

=== Frontier castles ===
{{Main|Castles in Portugal}}
Most of the castles in this border region of Central are classified as [[List of national monuments of Portugal|national monuments]]. These stone fortresses date back to the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries. Castles, or parts of castles, still stand at Alfaiates, Sortelha, [[Vila Maior (Santa Maria da Feira)|Vilar Maior]], [[Sabugal]], Castelo Mendo, [[Castelo do Mau Vizinho|Castelo Bom]], Castelo Rodrigo, Penamacor, Monsanto, Pinhel and Almeida.  A 20-castle route has been delineated by the Portugal government (see [https://www.visitportugal.com/en www.visitportugal.com]), of which Sortelha, Castelo Mendo, Castelo Rodrigo and the fortified town of [[Almeida, Portugal|Almeida]] are considered gems among them all.

== Geography ==
[[File:Fátima -i---i- (40991071371).jpg|thumb|right|220px|The [[Sanctuary of Fátima]] is located in the Central Region of Portugal.]]
The ''Centro'' is a region of diversified landscapes. The interior is mountainous with some plateaus, dominated by the [[Serra da Estrela]] mountain. The region is plentiful of [[pine tree|pine]] and [[chestnut]] trees forests. The green, rugged landscape of this region is crisscrossed by rivers. Several river valleys at the foot of the mountains have a full bodied charm that draw one to outdoor activities like hiking, fishing, tennis and canoeing. In the Winter season, skiing on ''Serra da Estrela'' is a popular activity, but in some places, like near the town of [[Seia]], skiing before the Winter season is possible due to artificial snow infrastructures. The coastal plain has several beaches, like the ones of [[Mira, Portugal|Mira]], [[Figueira da Foz]], [[Ílhavo]]. Natural landmarks in this region are the [[Serra da Estrela]] mountain range (the biggest and highest in [[mainland Portugal]]), with its [[Serra da Estrela Natural Park]], the [[Mondego River|Mondego river]] (the longest river located exclusively in Portuguese territory), the [[Aveiro Lagoon]] ''(Ria de Aveiro)'' and the coastal beaches.

The largest urban centres include [[Coimbra]],[[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]], [[Viseu]], [[Leiria]], [[Covilhã]], [[Castelo Branco, Portugal|Castelo Branco]], [[Figueira da Foz]], [[Guarda, Portugal|Guarda]], [[Pombal, Portugal|Pombal]] and [[Águeda Municipality|Águeda]].

=== Subregions ===
[[File:Centro NUTS 2.png|right|thumb|235px|Subregion map of the Central Region]]  
The region is divided in eight sub-regions:
* [[Beira Baixa (intermunicipal community)|Beira Baixa]]
* [[Beiras e Serra da Estrela]]
* [[Região de Aveiro]]
* [[Região de Coimbra]]
* [[Região de Leiria]]
* [[Viseu Dão Lafões]]

== Economy ==
The [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 38.2 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 18.8% of Portugal's economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 20,100 euros or 67% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 68% of the EU average.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|website=Eurostat}}</ref>

One of Portugal's richest regions by the abundance of natural streams of water, forests, arable land and its long coast line, the Central region has some of the most economically dynamic and densely populated municipalities of the country. Excellent transportation links with the [[Lisbon metropolitan area]] to the south and the [[Porto Metropolitan Area]] to the north, making ocean, rail and motorway access possible via containers, have all contributed to making manufacturing the principal industry, found mainly in the littoral strip, which is one of the largest industrialized areas in Portugal. Important products such as [[motor vehicles]], [[food]], [[electrical appliance]]s, [[machinery]], [[chemicals]], and [[paper]] are produced there. [[Higher education in Portugal|Higher education]], [[Science and technology in Portugal|research and development]], [[Health in Portugal|healthcare]], [[information technologies]], [[biotechnology]], [[forestry]], [[Agriculture in Portugal|agriculture]], [[Fishing in Portugal|fishing]], and [[Tourism in Portugal|tourism]] industries are all major industries in the region. The [[Portuguese wines|wine]] regions of [[Dão DOC]] and [[Bairrada DOC]] are among the most reputed in [[Portugal]]. The major industrial, commerce, and service centres are located in and around [[Coimbra]], [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]], [[Viseu]], [[Leiria]], [[Covilhã]], [[Castelo Branco, Portugal|Castelo Branco]], and [[Figueira da Foz]]. Important light industry and agriculture is also based in and around [[Guarda, Portugal|Guarda]].

== Education ==
The Central region has three [[public universities]]: the [[University of Coimbra]], the oldest Portuguese university and the largest in the region; the [[Aveiro University]]; and the [[University of Beira Interior]]. There are also five state-run [[Polytechnic (Portugal)|polytechnical]] institutes: [[Castelo Branco Polytechnical Institute]]; [[Coimbra Polytechnical Institute]]; [[Guarda Polytechnical Institute]]; [[Leiria Polytechnical Institute]]; Tomar Polytechnical Institute and [[Viseu Polytechnical Institute]]. In addition, there are a large number of public [[nursing school]]s and [[private school|private higher education]] institutions across the region.
