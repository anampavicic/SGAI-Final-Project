==Etymology==
[[File:කොළඹ ලාංඡනය ලන්දේසි.JPG|150px|thumbnail|left|Coat of arms of Colombo from the [[Dutch Ceylon]] era, depicting a [[mango tree]]]]

The name 'Colombo', first introduced by the [[Portuguese explorers]] in 1505, is believed to be derived from the classical [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] name {{lang|si|කොලොන් තොට}}, {{lang|ta|கொல்லம் துறைமுகம்}} ''Kolon thota'', meaning "port on the river [[Kelani River|Kelani]]".<ref name="so1">{{cite news |url=https://archives.sundayobserver.lk/2004/02/15/fea15.html |title=Colombo – then and now |work=Padma Edirisinghe |publisher=The Sunday Observer |date=14 February 2004 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171524/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2004/02/15/fea15.html |archive-date=30 September 2007 }}</ref>

Another belief is that the name is derived from the Sinhala name {{lang|si|කොල-අඹ-තොට}}, {{lang|ta|பெருங்குடல் துறைமுகம்}} ''Kola-amba-thota'' which means 'Harbour with leafy/green mango trees'.<ref name="we1">''World Executive'' [http://www.worldexecutive.com/locations/asia_pacific/sri_lanka/colombo/ Colombo Hotels and City Guide] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302145548/http://www.worldexecutive.com/locations/asia_pacific/sri_lanka/colombo/ |date=2016-03-02 }}</ref> This coincides with [[Robert Knox (sailor)|Robert Knox]]'s history of the island while he was a prisoner in Kandy. He writes that "On the West, the City of Columbo, so-called from a Tree the Natives call Ambo, (which bears the Mango-fruit) growing in that place; but this never bear fruit, but only leaves, which in their Language is kola and thence they called the Tree Colambo: which the Christians in honour of [[Christopher Columbus]] turned to Columbo."

The author of the oldest Sinhala grammar, ''Sidatsangarava,'' written in the 13th century wrote about a category of words that exclusively belonged to early Sinhala. It lists ''naramba'' (to see) and ''kolamba'' (fort or harbour) as deriving from the indigenous [[Vedda language]]. ''Kolamba'' may also be the source of the name of the commercial capital Colombo.<ref>{{cite book |last=Indrapala |first=Karthigesu |title=The evolution of an ethnic identity: The Tamils in Sri Lanka C. 300 BCE to C. 1200 CE |publisher=Vijitha Yapa |year=2007 |location=Colombo |isbn=978-955-1266-72-1 |page=70}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Gair |first=James |title=Studies in South Asian Linguistics |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=978-0-19-509521-0 |page=5}}</ref>

===Portuguese era===
[[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers led by Dom [[Lourenço de Almeida]] first arrived in Sri Lanka in 1505. During their initial visit they made a treaty with the King of [[Kingdom of Kotte|Kotte]], [[Parakramabahu VIII]] (1484–1518), which enabled them to trade in the island's crop of [[cinnamon]], which lay along with the coastal areas of the island, including in Colombo.<ref name="cs1"/> As part of the treaty, the Portuguese were given full authority over the coastline in exchange for the promise of guarding the coast against invaders. They were allowed to establish a [[trading post]] in Colombo.<ref name="cs1"/> Within a short time, however, they expelled the [[Sri Lankan Moors|Muslim]] inhabitants of Colombo and began to build a [[fort]] in 1517.

The Portuguese soon realised that control of Sri Lanka was necessary for the protection of their coastal establishments in India, and they began to manipulate the rulers of the Kotte kingdom to gain control of the area. After skilfully exploiting rivalries within the royal family, they took control of a large area of the kingdom and the Sinhalese King Mayadunne established a new kingdom at Sitawaka, a domain in the Kotte kingdom.<ref name="cs1"/> Before long he annexed much of the Kotte kingdom and forced the Portuguese to retreat to Colombo, which was repeatedly besieged by Mayadunne and the later kings of Sitawaka, forcing them to seek reinforcement from their major base in [[Goa]], India. Following the fall of the kingdom in 1593, the Portuguese were able to establish complete control over the coastal area, with Colombo as their capital.<ref name="cs1">{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/sri-lanka/8.htm |title=European Encroachment and Dominance:The Portuguese |access-date=2006-12-02 |work=Sri Lanka: A Country Study |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005225344/http://countrystudies.us/sri-lanka/8.htm |archive-date=2006-10-05 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="cs2">

This part of Colombo is still known as [[Fort (Colombo)|Fort]] and houses the presidential palace and the majority of Colombo's [[hotel rating|five star]] hotels. The area immediately outside Fort is known as [[Pettah, Sri Lanka|Pettah]] ({{langx|si|පිට කොටුව}},{{langx|ta|புறக் கோட்டை}} ''piṭa koṭuva'', "outer fort") and is a commercial hub.

===Dutch era===
[[File: Colombo, after Kip.jpg|thumb|left|Dutch engraving of Colombo in about 1680]]

In 1638 the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] signed a treaty with King Rajasinha II of Kandy which assured the king assistance in his war against the Portuguese in exchange for a monopoly of the island's major trade goods. The Portuguese resisted the Dutch and the Kandyans but were gradually defeated in their strongholds beginning in 1639.<ref name="cs4"/> The Dutch captured Colombo in 1656 after an epic siege, at the end of which a mere 93 Portuguese survivors were given [[Safe-conduct|safe conduct]] out of the fort. Although the Dutch (e.g., [[Rijcklof van Goens]]) initially restored the captured area back to the Sinhalese kings, they later refused to turn them over and gained control over the island's richest cinnamon lands including Colombo which then served as the capital of the Dutch maritime provinces under the control of the [[Dutch East India Company]] until 1796.<ref name="cs4">{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/sri-lanka/9.htm |title=European Encroachment and Dominance: The Dutch |access-date=2006-12-02 |work=Sri Lanka: A Country study |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005225414/http://countrystudies.us/sri-lanka/9.htm |archive-date=2006-10-05 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="cs3">

===British era===

[[File:Map of Colombo (Baedeker, 1914).jpg|thumb|left|Map of Colombo, c. 1914]]

Although the British captured Colombo in 1796, it remained a [[British Armed Forces|British military]] outpost until the Kandyan Kingdom was ceded to them in 1815 and they made Colombo the capital of their newly created [[British overseas territories|crown colony]] of [[British Ceylon]]. Unlike the Portuguese and Dutch before them, whose primary use of Colombo was as a military fort, the British began constructing houses and other civilian structures around the fort, giving rise to the current City of Colombo.<ref name="HoC"/>

Initially, they placed the administration of the city under a "[[District collector|Collector]]", and John Macdowell of the [[Madras Presidency|Madras]] Service was the first to hold the office. Then, in 1833, the [[Government Agent (Sri Lanka)|Government Agent]] of the Western Province was charged with the administration of the city. Centuries of [[Colonialism|colonial rule]] had meant a decline of indigenous administration of Colombo and in 1865 the British conceived a Municipal Council as a means of training the local population in [[self-governance]]. The [[Legislative Council of Ceylon]] constituted the Colombo Municipal Council in 1865 and the Council met for the first time on 16 January 1866. At the time, the population of the region was around 80,000.<ref name="HoC"/>

During the time they were in control of Colombo, the British were responsible for much of the planning of the present city. In some parts of the city, [[tram]] car tracks and granite flooring laid during the era are still visible today.<ref name="cs3"/><ref name="cs5">{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/sri-lanka/11.htm |title=European Encroachment and Dominance: The British Replace the Dutch |access-date=2006-12-02 |work=Sri Lanka: A Country study |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005225028/http://countrystudies.us/sri-lanka/11.htm |archive-date=2006-10-05 |url-status=live }}</ref>

An entire new culture took root. Changes in laws and customs, clothing styles, religions and [[proper names]] were a significant result of the colonial era.<ref name="PostI"/> These cultural changes were followed by the strengthening of the island's economy. Even today, the influence of the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British is visible in Colombo's architecture, names, clothing, food, language and attitudes. Buildings from all three eras stand as reminders of the turbulent past of Colombo. The city and its people show an interesting mix of European clothing and lifestyles together with local customs.<ref name="PostI"/>

Historically, Colombo referred to the area around the ''[[Fort (Colombo)|Fort]]'' and ''[[Pettah Market]]'' which is known for the variety of products available as well as the [[Khan Clock Tower]], a local landmark. At present, it refers to the city limits of the [[Colombo Municipal Council]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Administrative Districts of the Colombo Municipal Council |url=http://www.cmc.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=64&Itemid=85 |publisher=Colombo Municipal Council |access-date=11 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106233608/http://www.cmc.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=64&Itemid=85 |archive-date=6 January 2013 }}{{Circular reference|date=February 2016}}</ref> More often, the name is used for the [[Conurbation]] known as [[Greater Colombo]], which encompasses several [[Municipal council]]s including [[Kotte]], Dehiwela and Colombo.

Although Colombo lost its status as the capital of Sri Lanka in the 1980s to Sri Jayawardanapura, it continues to be the island's commercial centre. Despite the official capital of Sri Lanka moving to the adjacent Sri Jayawardanapura Kotte, most countries still maintain their [[diplomatic mission]]s in Colombo.<ref name="emb1">''GoAbroad.com'', [http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/sri-lanka Embassies located in Sri Lanka] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302031441/http://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-in/sri-lanka |date=2016-03-02 }}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:Beira lake at Nite.jpg|thumb|400px|The [[Beira Lake]] at night]]

Colombo is a [[charter city]], with a [[mayor-council government]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Colombo Municipal Council |url=http://colombo.mc.gov.lk/colombo.php |access-date=2018-04-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413185636/http://colombo.mc.gov.lk/colombo.php |archive-date=2018-04-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The mayor and council members are elected through local government elections held once in five years. For the past 50 years the city had been ruled by the [[United National Party]] (UNP), a [[Right-wing politics|right]] leaning party, whose business-friendly policies resonate with the population of Colombo. However, the UNP nomination list for the 2006 Municipal elections was rejected,<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/sinhala/news/story/2006/02/060216_colombo.shtml Colombo UNP list rejected] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016093710/http://www.bbc.com/sinhala/news/story/2006/02/060216_colombo.shtml |date=2015-10-16 }}, ''BBC News'', February 16, 2006</ref> and an Independent Group supported by the UNP won the elections.<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/sinhala/news/story/2006/05/060521_cmc_election.shtml Independent group wins CMC] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016093710/http://www.bbc.com/sinhala/news/story/2006/05/060521_cmc_election.shtml |date=2015-10-16 }}, ''BBC News'', May 21, 2006</ref> [[Uvais Mohamed Imitiyas]] was subsequently appointed Mayor of Colombo.<ref>[http://www.sundaytimes.lk/060528/index.html Rotational mayors as Colombo gets trishaw driver as her first citizen] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716163027/http://www.sundaytimes.lk/060528/index.html |date=2007-07-16 }}, ''Sunday Times'', May 28, 2006</ref>

The city government provides sewer, road and waste management services to the residents. In the case of water, electricity and telephone utility services, the council liaises with the [[National Water Supply and Drainage Board|National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB)]], the [[Ceylon Electricity Board|Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB)]] and [[Telecommunications in Sri Lanka|telephone service providers]] operating in the country respectively.

===National capital status===
Colombo was the capital of the coastal areas controlled by the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British from the 1700s to 1815 when the British gained control of the entire island following the [[Kandyan convention]]. From then until the 1980s the national capital of the island was Colombo.

During the 1980s plans were made to move the administrative capital to [[Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte]] and thus move all governmental institutions out of Colombo to make way for commercial activities. As a primary step, the [[Parliament of Sri Lanka|Parliament]] was moved to a new complex in Kotte, with several ministries and departments also relocated. However, the move was never completed.

Today, many governmental institutions still remain in Colombo. These include the [[President's House, Colombo|President's House]], [[Presidential Secretariat (Sri Lanka)|Presidential Secretariat]], [[Prime Minister's House (Colombo)|Prime Minister's House]] (Temple Trees), [[Prime Minister's Office (Colombo)|Prime Minister's Office]], the [[Supreme Court of Sri Lanka]], [[Central Bank of Sri Lanka]], important government ministries and departments; such as [[Ministry of Finance and Planning (Sri Lanka)|Finance]] (Treasury), [[Ministry of Defence (Sri Lanka)|Defence]], Public Administration & Home affairs, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Sri Lanka)|Foreign affairs]], Justice and the [[Army Headquarters (Sri Lanka)|Military headquarters]], Naval headquarters ([[SLNS Parakrama]]), Air Force headquarters ([[SLAF Colombo]]) and [[Sri Lanka Police|Police]] national and field force headquarters.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka |url=http://www.justiceministry.gov.lk/courts%20of%20Law/THE%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20SRI%20LANKA.htm |publisher=Justice Ministry |access-date=November 22, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118060405/http://www.justiceministry.gov.lk/courts%20of%20Law/THE%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20SRI%20LANKA.htm |archive-date=November 18, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Ministries of Sri Lanka Government |publisher=Government of Sri Lanka |url=http://www.gov.lk/public/groups.asp?xi=91&groupname=Ministries+of+Sri+Lanka+Government |access-date=November 22, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309224646/http://www.gov.lk/public/groups.asp?xi=91&groupname=Ministries+of+Sri+Lanka+Government |archive-date=March 9, 2007 }}</ref>

As in other large cities around the world, Colombo experiences certain levels of [[street crime]] and [[bribery]]. Indeed, the corruption extends to the very top, US reports show. In addition, in the period from the 1980s to 2009, there have been a number of major terrorist attacks.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cns.miis.edu/pubs/reports/convter.htm |title=CNS Reports |website= Center for Nonproliferation Studies  |access-date=2001-10-03 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20011003225523/http://cns.miis.edu/pubs/reports/convter.htm |archive-date=2001-10-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Travel Warning, United States Department of State |url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/tw/tw_3011.html |access-date=November 22, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922205811/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/tw/tw_3011.html |archive-date=September 22, 2006 }}</ref> The [[LTTE]] has been linked to most of the bombings and assassinations in the city.<ref>[http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/sentinel/sent000904_6_n.shtml Jane's Sentinel examines the success of the LTTE in resisting the Sri Lankan forces]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415225914/http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/sentinel/sent000904_6_n.shtml |date=April 15, 2009 }}{{Circular reference|date=February 2016}}</ref> [[Welikada Prison]] is situated in Colombo and it is one of the largest maximum-security prisons in the country.<ref>[http://www.lankanewspapers.com/news/2006/2/5627.html President orders SB's release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022073304/http://www.lankanewspapers.com/news/2006/2/5627.html |date=October 22, 2007 }}, ''LankaNewspapers.com'', February 16, 2006</ref>

==Infrastructure==
[[File:Colombo Port City seem from galle road..jpg|thumb|Colombo Galle face road in the evening ]]
Colombo has most of the amenities that a modern city has. Compared to other parts of the country, Colombo has the highest degree of infrastructure. Electricity, water and transport to street lights and phone booths are to a considerably good standard. Apart from that, many luxurious hotels, clubs and restaurants are in the city. In recent times there has been an outpour of [[high-rise]] condominiums, mainly due to the very high land prices.<ref name="Lanka-houses">{{cite web|title=Colombo|url=http://lanka-houses.com/city/colombo/|publisher=lanka-houses.com|access-date=29 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104193949/http://lanka-houses.com/city/colombo/|archive-date=4 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Harbour===
[[File:ColomboHarbour-SriLanka02.jpg|thumb|Container handling at Colombo Port.]]
[[Port of Colombo|Colombo Harbour]] is the largest and one of the busiest [[port]]s in Sri Lanka. Colombo was established primarily as a port city during the colonial era, with an artificial harbour that has been expanded over the years. The [[Sri Lanka Navy]] maintains a [[naval base]], ''SLNS Rangalla'', within the harbour.

The Port of Colombo handled 3.75&nbsp;million [[twenty-foot equivalent unit]]s in 2008, 10.6% up on 2007 (which itself was 9.7% up on 2006), bucking the global economic trend. Of those, 817,000 were local shipments with the rest transshipments. With a capacity of 5.7&nbsp;million TEUs and a dredged depth of over 15&nbsp;m (49&nbsp;ft), the Colombo Harbour is one of the busiest ports in the world and ranks among the top 25 ports (23rd). Sri Lanka's Port of Colombo is said to be the busiest, largest port in the Indian Ocean.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cost of Living in Colombo, Sri Lanka – PropertyInLanka.com |url=https://www.propertyinlanka.com/cost-of-living-in-colombo-sri-lanka/ |access-date=2024-03-31 |language=en-GB}}</ref>

===Transport===
==== Bus ====
Colombo has an extensive public transport system based on buses operated both by private operators and the government-owned [[Sri Lanka Transport Board|Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB)]]. The three primary bus terminals – Bastian Mawatha, Central and the Gunasinghapura Bus Terminals – are in Pettah.<ref>{{cite web |author=Hasintha Weragala, Things to do in Sri Lanka |url=https://www.thingstodosrilanka.com/colombo-sri-lanka-travel-guide/#bbs2 |title=Guide map of bus terminals in Colombo |publisher=thingstodoinsrilanla.lk |date=2018-11-27 |access-date=2018-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181204195236/https://www.thingstodosrilanka.com/colombo-sri-lanka-travel-guide/#bbs2 |archive-date=4 December 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Bastian Mawatha handles long-distance services whereas Gunasinghapura and Central handle local services.

==== Rail ====
[[File:Train track on the beach in Colombo (16779050855).jpg|thumb|Commuter rail within the city]]
{{main|Sri Lanka Railways}}
Train transport [[Sri Lanka Railways#Commuter Rail|in the city]] is limited since most trains are meant for transport to and from the city rather than within it and are often overcrowded. However, the Central Bus Stand and [[Fort Railway Station (Colombo)|Fort Railway Station]] function as the island's primary hub for bus and rail transport respectively. Up until the 1970s, the city had [[tram]] services, which were discontinued. Other means of transport include [[auto rickshaws]] (commonly called "three-wheelers") and [[taxicab]]s. Three-wheelers are entirely operated by individuals and hardly regulated whilst cab services are run by private companies and are metered.

==== Roads ====
Post-war development in the Colombo area also involves the construction of numerous expressway grade arterial road routes. The first of these constructed is the [[Southern Expressway (Sri Lanka)|Southern Expressway]], which goes from [[Kottawa]], a southern suburb of Colombo, to [[Matara, Sri Lanka|Matara]] City in the south of the country. Expressways constructed in the Colombo metropolitan area include the [[Colombo–Katunayake Expressway]], which was opened in October 2013 and the Colombo orbital bypass Outer Circular Highway ([[Outer Circular Highway|Arthur C. Clarke Expressway]]). The [[Colombo-Katunayake Expressway]] (E03) runs from [[Peliyagoda]], a northern suburb of Colombo, to [[Colombo International Airport]] and it is linked with one of the major commercial hubs and a major tourist destination of the country, the city of [[Negombo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2011/08/16/fea14.asp |title=A Speedy and safe journey to Galle |publisher=Dailynews.lk |date=2011-08-16 |access-date=2013-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030164322/http://archives.dailynews.lk/2011/08/16/fea14.asp |archive-date=2013-10-30 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Gamini Gunaratna, Sri Lanka News Paper by LankaPage.com (LLC) |url=http://www.colombopage.com/archive_11B/Nov07_1320645974JR.php |title=Nearly half of the work completed on outer circular highway around Sri Lankan capital |publisher=Colombopage.com |date=2011-11-07 |access-date=2013-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903220847/http://www.colombopage.com/archive_11B/Nov07_1320645974JR.php |archive-date=2013-09-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==== Ferry ====
An international ferry liner, the [[Scotia Prince]], is conducting a ferry service to [[Tuticorin]], India.  Ferry services between the two countries have been revived after more than 20 years.<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Tuticorin-Colombo-ferry-sets-sail-/articleshow/8842845.cms?referral=PM Tuticorin-Colombo ferry sets sail] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003062309/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Tuticorin-Colombo-ferry-sets-sail-/articleshow/8842845.cms?referral=PM |date=2016-10-03 }}.

==== Air ====
[[File:Colombo Airport Ratmalana Landside View.jpg|thumb|Ratmalana Airport]]

[[Ratmalana Airport]] is the city's airport, located {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the city centre. It commenced operating in 1935 and was the country's first international airport until it was replaced by [[Bandaranaike Airport]] in 1967. Ratmalana Airport now primarily services domestic flights, aviation training and international corporate flights.

===Landmarks===
[[File:Colombo Skyline Jan 2022.jpg|thumb|Colombo Skyline – 2022]]
The two [[World Trade Center Colombo|World Trade Centre]] towers used to be the most recognised landmarks of the city. Before they were completed in 1997, the adjacent [[Bank of Ceylon]] tower was the tallest structure and the most prominent city landmark. Before the skyscrapers were built, the Old Parliament Building that stood in the Fort district with the [[Old Colombo Lighthouse]] close to it used to be the tallest building. Another important landmark is the [[Independence Commemoration Hall (Sri Lanka)|Independence Hall]] at Independence Square in Cinnamon Gardens.

Another landmark is St.Paul's Church [[Milagiriya]], one of the oldest [[church (building)|churches]] in Sri Lanka, first built by the Portuguese and rebuilt by the British in 1848. The Cargills & Millers building in Fort is also a protected building of historical significance.

[[Cannon]]s that were once mounted on the rampart of the old fort of Colombo were laid out for observance and prestige at the Green. The colonial styled [[Galle Face Hotel]], known as Asia's Emerald on the Green since 1864, is adjacent to Galle Face Green. The hotel has played host to guests such as the [[British Royal Family]] and other [[royal family|royal]] guests and celebrities. After a stay at the hotel, [[Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg|Princess Alexandra]] of Denmark commented that "the peacefulness and generosity encountered at the [[Galle Face Hotel]] cannot be matched."<ref name="Galleface">{{cite web |title=Princess Alexandra's Visit |url=http://www.gallefacehotel.com/html_classic/the_hotel.htm |access-date=November 22, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070413052940/http://www.gallefacehotel.com/html_classic/the_hotel.htm |archive-date=April 13, 2007}}</ref> Also facing Galle Face Green is the [[Ceylon Inter-Continental]] Hotel.

== Education ==
[[File:Royal College Colombo main building.jpg|thumb|right|[[Royal College Colombo]], the oldest public school in the city.]]{{See also|Education in Sri Lanka}}
Education institutions in Colombo have a long history. Colombo has many of the prominent [[Public school (UK)|public schools]] in the country, some of them government-owned and others private. Most of the prominent schools in the city date back to the 1800s when they were established during the British colonial rule,<ref>{{cite web |title=Historical Overview of Education in Sri Lanka, The British Period: (1796–1948) |url=http://www.moe.gov.lk/Education_his_1.3.html |access-date=November 22, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411221808/http://www.moe.gov.lk/Education_his_1.3.html |archive-date=April 11, 2011}}</ref> such as the [[Royal College Colombo]] established in 1835.

Colombo has widely varying architecture that spans centuries and depicts many styles. [[colonial architecture|Colonial]] buildings influenced by the [[Architecture of Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Architecture of the Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[Architecture of the United Kingdom|British]] exist alongside structures built in [[Buddhist architecture|Buddhist]], [[Hindu architecture|Hindu]], [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]], [[Architecture of India|Indian]] and [[Contemporary architecture|Contemporary]] architectural styles.

===Colombo Fort===
The Portuguese were the first colonists to settle in Colombo. Establishing a small trading post, they had laid the foundations for a small fort which in time became the largest colonial fort on the island. The Dutch expanded the fort, thus creating a well fortified harbour. This came into the possession of the British in the late 1700s, and by the late 19th century, seeing no threat to the [[Colombo Harbour]], began demolishing the ramparts to make way for the development of the city. Although now there is nothing left of the fortifications, the area which was once the fort is still referred to as Fort. The area outside is [[Pettah, Sri Lanka]] or {{lang|si|පිටකොටුව}} ''Pitakotuwa'' in Sinhala which means outer fort.<ref name="oldCMB1"/><ref name="oldCMB2"/>

===Dutch-era buildings===

There are none of the buildings of the Portuguese era and only a few from the Dutch period. These include the oldest building in the fort area, the [[Old Colombo Dutch Hospital|former Dutch Hospital]], the Dutch House which is now the [[Colombo Dutch Museum]] and several churches. The [[President's House, Colombo|President's House]] (formerly the Queen's House) was originally the Dutch governor's house and successive British governors made it their office and residence. However, it has undergone much change since the Dutch period. Adjoining the President's House are the Gordon Gardens, now off-limits to the public.<ref name="oldCMB1"/><ref name="oldCMB2"/><ref>{{Cite web |last=Ramerini |first=Marco |title=Asia.

===British-era buildings===
Much of the old buildings of the fort area and in other parts of the city date back to British times; these include governmental, commercial buildings, and private houses. Some of the notable government building of British colonial architecture includes the old Parliament building, which is now the [[Presidential Secretariat (Sri Lanka)|Presidential Secretariat]]; the [[Republic Building, Colombo|Republic Building]], which houses the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Sri Lanka)|Ministry of Foreign affairs]] but once housed the Ceylon Legislative council; the [[General Treasury Building]]; the old [[General Post Office, Colombo|General Post Office]], an Edwardian-style building opposite the President's House; the [[Prime Minister's Office (Colombo)|Prime Minister's Office]]; the [[Central Telegraph Office, Colombo|Central Telegraph Office]]; and the [[Old Royal College Building, Colombo|Mathematics department]] of the [[University of Colombo]] (formally the [[Royal College, Colombo]]).<ref name="cmb.ac.lk"/> Notable commercial buildings of the British era include the [[Galle Face Hotel]], Cargills and Millers' complex, and the [[Grand Oriental Hotel]].<ref name="oldCMB1"/><ref name="oldCMB2"/>

During this festival, much of the city is decorated with lanterns, lights and special displays of light (known as ''thoran''). The festival falls in mid-May and lasts a week. Many Sri Lankans visit the city to see the lantern competitions and decorations. During this week people distribute, rice, drinks and other food items for free in ''dunsal'' which means charity place. These ''dunsal'' are popular amongst visitors from the suburbs.

Since there is a large number of Muslims in Colombo. Eid Ul Fitr and Eid Ul Adha are two Islamic festivals that are celebrated in Colombo. Many businesses flourish during the eventual countdown for Eid Ul Fitr which is a major Islamic festival celebrated by Muslims after a month-long fasting. Colombo is generally very busy on the eve of the festivals as people do their last-minute shopping.

Christmas is another major festival. Although Sri Lanka's Christians make up only just over 7% of the population, Christmas is one of the island's biggest festivals. Most streets and commercial buildings light up from the beginning of December and festive sales begin at all shopping centres and department stores. Caroling and nativity plays are frequent sights during the season.

The Sinhalese and Hindu Aluth Awurudda' is a cultural event that takes place on 13 and 14 April. This is the celebration of the Sinhalese and Hindu new year. The festivities include many events and traditions that display a great deal of Sri Lankan culture.
Several old clubs of the city give a glimpse of the British equestrian lifestyle; these include the [[Colombo Club]], [[Orient Club]], the 80 Club, and the [[Colombo Cricket Club]].

=== Performing arts ===
[[File:The landmark Nelum Pokuna (Lotus Pond) Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre]] is a major venue for the performing arts|223x223px]]

Many of the privately run television station networks were often based upon operational expansions of pre-existing commercial radio networks and broadcast infrastructure.
