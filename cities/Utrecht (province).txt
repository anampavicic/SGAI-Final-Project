'''Utrecht''' ({{IPA|nl|ˈytrɛxt|-|260 Utrecht.ogg}}), officially the '''Province of Utrecht''' ({{langx|nl|Provincie Utrecht|link=no}}), is a [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of the [[Netherlands]]. It is located in the centre of the country, bordering the [[Eemmeer]] in the north-east, the province of [[Gelderland]] in the east and south-east, the province of [[South Holland]] in the west and south-west and the province of [[North Holland]] in the north-west and north. The province of Utrecht has a population of about 1,388,000<ref name="auto"/> as of January 2023. With a land area of approximately {{convert|1484|km2|sqmi}}, it is the second smallest province in the country. Apart from its [[Utrecht|eponymous capital]], major cities and towns in the province are [[Amersfoort]], [[Houten]], [[IJsselstein]], [[Nieuwegein]], [[Veenendaal]] and [[Zeist]]. The busiest [[railway station]] in the Netherlands, [[Utrecht Centraal railway station|Utrecht Centraal]], is located in the province of Utrecht.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Gerling |first=Marco |date=2019-07-04 |title=Utrecht Centraal blijft drukste station van Nederland, station Leidsche Rijn groeit het snelst |work=[[Algemeen Dagblad]] |url=https://www.ad.nl/utrecht/utrecht-centraal-blijft-drukste-station-van-nederland-station-leidsche-rijn-groeit-het-snelst~a869be29/ |access-date=2023-10-28}}</ref>

== History ==
The [[Archdiocese of Utrecht (695–1580)|Bishopric of Utrecht]] was established in 695 when Saint [[Willibrord]] was consecrated bishop of the [[Frisians]] at [[Rome]] by [[Pope Sergius I]]. With the consent of the [[Franks|Frankish]] ruler, [[Pippin of Herstal]], he settled in an old [[Castellum|Roman fort]] in [[Utrecht]]. After Willibrord's death the diocese suffered greatly from the incursions of the [[Vikings]]. Better times appeared during the reign of the [[Ottonian dynasty|Saxon emperors]], who frequently summoned the Bishops of Utrecht to attend the imperial councils and [[diet (assembly)|diet]]s. In 1024 the bishops were made Princes of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the new Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht was formed. In 1122, with the [[Concordat of Worms]], the Emperor's right of investiture was annulled, and the cathedral chapter received the right to elect the bishop. It was, however, soon obligated to share this right with the four other collegiate chapters in the city. The Counts of [[County of Holland|Holland]] and [[Guelders]], between whose territories the lands of the Bishops of Utrecht lay, also sought to acquire influence over the filling of the episcopal see. This often led to disputes and consequently the [[Holy See]] frequently interfered in the election. After the middle of the 14th century the popes repeatedly appointed the bishop directly without regard to the five chapters.

During the [[Hook and Cod Wars]], Utrecht was fought over by forces of the [[Duke of Burgundy]] leading to the [[First Utrecht Civil War]] (1470–1474) and [[Second Utrecht Civil War]] (1481–1483).

In 1527, the Bishop sold his territories, and thus his secular authority, to Holy Roman Emperor [[Emperor Charles V|Charles V]] and the principality became an integral part of the [[Habsburg]] dominions, which already included most other Dutch provinces. The chapters transferred their right of electing the bishop to Charles V and his government, a measure to which [[Pope Clement VII]] gave his consent, under political pressure after the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]]. However, the Habsburg rule did not last long, as Utrecht joined in the [[Dutch Revolt]] against Charles' successor [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] in 1579, becoming a part of the [[Dutch Republic]].

In [[World War II]], Utrecht was held by German forces until the general capitulation of the Germans in the Netherlands on May 5, 1945. It was occupied by Canadian Allied forces on May 7, 1945. The towns of [[Oudewater]], [[Woerden]], [[Vianen]] and [[Leerdam]] were transferred from the province of [[South Holland]] to Utrecht in 1970, 1989, 2002 and 2019 respectively. In February 2011, Utrecht, together with the provinces of [[North Holland]] and [[Flevoland]], showed a desire to investigate the feasibility of a merger between the three provinces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nos.nl/artikel/216649-drie-provincies-denken-over-fusie.html|title=Drie provincies denken over fusie|website=nos.nl|date=4 February 2011 |access-date=19 March 2018}}</ref> This has been positively received by the [[First Rutte cabinet|Dutch cabinet]], for the desire to create one [[Randstad|Randstad province]] has already been mentioned in the [[coalition agreement]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Randstadprovincies bekijken fusie |url=https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/artikel/3130831/randstadprovincies-bekijken-fusie |website=rtlnieuws |access-date=12 January 2019|date=2011-02-04 }}</ref> The province of South Holland, part of the Randstad urban area, visioned to be part of the Randstad province,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2011/02/04/randstadprovincies-onderzoeken-fusie-a1460453|title=Randstadprovincies onderzoeken fusie|newspaper=NRC|date=4 February 2011 |access-date=19 March 2018 |last1=Willems |first1=Marije }}</ref> and very much supportive of the idea of a merger into one province,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zuid-holland.nl/contentpagina.htm?id=74163 |title=Provincie Zuid-Holland - Nieuwsbericht |access-date=2011-02-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724173855/http://www.zuid-holland.nl/contentpagina.htm?id=74163 |archive-date=2011-07-24 }}</ref> is not named. With or without South Holland, if created, the new province would be the largest in the Netherlands in both [[Ranked list of Dutch provinces|area and population]].

== Geography ==
In the east of Utrecht lies the [[Utrecht Hill Ridge]] (Dutch: Utrechtse Heuvelrug), a chain of hills left as [[lateral moraine]] by tongues of glacial ice after the Saline glaciation that preceded the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]]. Because of the scarcity of nutrients in the fast-draining sandy soil, the greatest part of a landscape that was formerly [[heath (habitat)|heath]] has been planted with [[pine]] [[plantation]]s. The south of the province is a river landscape. The west consists mostly of meadows. In the north are big lakes formed by the digging of [[peat]] from bogs formed after the last ice age.

=== Nature ===
[[File:Blauwe kamer vanaf de Grebbedijk1.jpg|thumb|A site in Utrecht's nature reserve, {{Ill|Blauwe Kamer|nl|Blauwe Kamer (natuurgebied)}} near [[Rhenen]]]]

One of the most attractive natural areas in the province is the [[Vechtstreek]] ("Vecht region"), situated on either side of the [[Vecht (Utrecht)|Vecht]] river.

An international nature conservation organisation that has settled the head office of its Netherlands branch in this province (at Zeist) is the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]].
