== Toponymy ==
The name of the city echoes the Arabic name ''Laqant'' ({{lang|ar|لَقَنْت}}), ''al-Laqant'' (اللَّقَنْت) or ''Al-qant'' ({{lang|ar|القنت}}),<ref>{{Cite book |last=Arslan |first=Shakib |title=الحلل السندسية في الأخبار والآثار الأندلسية - Sindhis solutions in Andalusian news and effects |year=1936 |language=Arabic}}</ref> which in turn reflects the Latin ''[[Lucentum]]''<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Laqant |encyclopedia=Gran Enciclopedia Temática de la Comunidad Valenciana |volume=Historia |year=2009 |publisher=Editorial Prensa Valenciana |language=ca-valencia}}</ref> and Greek root ''Leuké'' (or ''Leuka''), meaning "white".

==History==
{{Main|History of Alicante|Timeline of Alicante}}

The area around Alicante has been inhabited for over 7,000 years. The first tribes of [[hunter-gatherer]]s moved gradually from Central Europe between 5000 and 3000 BC. Some of the earlier settlements were made on the slopes of [[Mount Benacantil]]. By 1000 BC, [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Phoenicia]]n traders had begun to visit the eastern coast of Spain, establishing small trading ports and introducing the native Iberian tribes to the alphabet, iron, and the pottery wheel. The Carthaginian general [[Hamilcar Barca]] established the fortified settlement of ''Akra Leuké'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἄκρα Λευκή}}, meaning "White Mountain" or "White Point"), in the mid-230s BC, which is generally presumed to have been on the site of modern Alicante.
[[File:Tossal-plantagral.jpg|thumb|left|Archeological site of Tossal de Manises, ancient [[Iberians|Iberian]]–[[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]]–[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city of ''Akra Leuké'' or ''[[Lucentum]]'']]

Although the Carthaginians conquered much of the land around Alicante, the Romans eventually ruled [[Hispania Tarraconensis]] for over 700 years. By the 5th century AD, Rome was in decline, and the Roman predecessor town of Alicante, known as ''[[Lucentum]]'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]), was more or less under the control of the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] warlord [[Theodemir (Visigoth)|Theudimer]] and thereafter under Visigothic rule from 400 to 700 A.D. The Goths did not put up much resistance to the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Arab conquest]] of ''Medina Laqant'' at the beginning of the 8th century. The Moors ruled southern and eastern Spain until the 13th century ''[[Reconquista]]'' (Reconquest). Alicante was conquered again in 1247 by the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] king [[Alfonso X]], but later passed to the [[Kingdom of Valencia]] in 1296 with King [[James II of Aragon]]. It gained the status of Royal Village (''Vila Reial'') with representation in the medieval [[Corts Valencianes|Valencian Parliament]] (''Corts Valencianes'').

After several decades of being the battlefield where the [[Crown of Castile]] and the [[Crown of Aragon]] clashed, Alicante became a major Mediterranean trading station exporting rice, wine, olive oil, oranges, and wool. But between 1609 and 1614 [[Philip III of Spain|King Felipe III]] expelled thousands of [[Morisco]]s who had remained in Valencia after the Reconquista, due to their cooperation with [[Barbary pirates]] who continually attacked coastal cities and caused much harm to trade. This act cost the region dearly; with so many skilled artisans and agricultural labourers gone, the feudal nobility found itself sliding into bankruptcy.

Conditions worsened in the early 18th century; after the [[War of Spanish Succession]], Alicante went into a long, slow decline, surviving through the 18th and 19th centuries by making shoes and growing agricultural produce such as oranges and almonds, and thanks to its fisheries. The end of the 19th century witnessed a sharp recovery of the local economy with increasing international trade and the growth of the city harbour leading to increased exports of several products (particularly during World War I when Spain was a neutral country).

During the early 20th century, Alicante was a minor capital that took profit from the benefit of Spain's neutrality during World War I, and it provided new opportunities for local industry and agriculture. The [[Rif War (1920)|Rif War]] in the 1920s saw numerous ''alicantinos'' drafted to fight in the long and bloody campaigns in the former Spanish protectorate (northern Morocco) against the Rif rebels. The political unrest of the late 1920s led to the victory of Republican candidates in local council elections throughout the country, and the abdication of [[King Alfonso XIII]]. The proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was much celebrated in the city on 14 April 1931. The [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out on 17 July 1936. Alicante was the last city loyal to the Republican government to be occupied by General Franco's troops on 1 April 1939, and its harbour saw the last Republican government officials fleeing the country. Vicious air bombings were targeted on Alicante during the three years of civil conflict, most notably the [[Bombing of Alicante|bombing]] by the Italian ''[[Aviazione Legionaria]]'' of the [[Mercado Central de Alicante|Mercado]] on 25 May 1938 in which more than 300 civilians perished.

The port of Alicante was the site of the heroic episode of the British ship ''[[SS Stanbrook]]'' in 1939 at the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Her captain [[Archibald Dickson (WWII)|Archibald Dickson]] decided to rescue thousands of [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Spanish Republicans]] families during the night of 28 March 1939 under the bombing of the Nazis.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cwgc.org/find-records/find-war-dead/casualty-details/2782442/archibald-dickson/ | title=Master Archibald Dickson &#124; War Casualty Details 2782442 }}</ref>

From 1954 onward, many ''[[pied-noir]]s'' settled in the city (as many as 30,000, although other sources decrease the amount tenfold).{{Sfn|Garrigós Monerris|Daniel Villa|2009|p=60}} Alicante had fostered strong links with [[Oran]] in the past, and a notable share of the population of the latter city during the French colonial period had ancestry in the province of Alicante.{{Sfn|Garrigós Monerris|Daniel Villa|2009|p=60}} The immigration process accelerated after the [[independence of Algeria|independence of Algeria in 1962]].{{Sfn|Garrigós Monerris|Daniel Villa|2009|p=60}}
[[File:Playa de Alicante.jpg|thumb|right|[[El Postiguet beach]] in 1957]]
The late 1950s and early 1960s saw the onset of a lasting transformation of the city by the tourist industry. Large buildings and complexes rose in nearby [[Albufereta]], e.g. [[El Barco, Alicante|El Barco]], and [[San Juan de Alicante|Playa de San Juan de Alicante]], with the benign climate being the biggest draw to attract prospective buyers and tourists who kept the hotels reasonably busy. New construction benefited the whole economy, as the development of the tourism sector also spawned new businesses such as restaurants, bars, and other tourist-oriented enterprises. Also, the old airfield at Rabasa was closed and air traffic moved to the new [[El Altet Airport]], which made a more convenient and modern facility for charter flights bringing tourists from northern European countries.

When Franco died in 1975, his successor [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]] played his part as the living symbol of the transition of Spain to a democratic constitutional monarchy. The governments of regional communities were given constitutional status as ''[[Nationalities and regions of Spain|nationalities]]'', and their governments were given more autonomy, including that of the Valencian region, the ''[[Generalitat Valenciana]]''.

The [[Port of Alicante]] has been reinventing itself since the [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]] the city suffered in the 1980s (with most mercantile traffic lost to Valencia's harbour). In recent years, the Port Authority has established it as one of the most important ports in Spain for cruises, with 72 calls to port made by cruise ships in 2007 bringing some 80,000 passengers and 30,000 crew to the city each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panorama-actual.es/noticias/not226759.htm |title=El puerto de Alicante registrará 72 escalas de cruceros durante 2007 |work=Diariocrítico de la Comunidad Valenciana |language=es|date=16 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720143417/http://www.panorama-actual.es/noticias/not226759.htm |archive-date=20 July 2011}}</ref> The moves to develop the port for more tourism have been welcomed by the city and its residents, but the latest plans to develop an [[industrial park|industrial estate]] in the port have caused great controversy.

== Geography ==
Alicante is located in the southeast of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], on the shores of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Some orographic features rise over the largely flat terrain where the city is built on including the [[Cabo de la Huerta]], the [[Serra Grossa]], the [[Tosal]] and the [[Benacantil]] hills.

Located in an arid territory, Alicante lacks any meaningful permanent water stream.{{Sfn|Martínez Martínez|2014|p=87}} There are however several stream beds correspondent to intermittent [[Arroyo (watercourse)|''ramblas'']].{{Sfn|Martínez Martínez|2014|p=87}} There was a swamp area in the northeast of the municipality, ''l'Albufereta'', yet it was dried up in 1928.{{Sfn|Martínez Martínez|2014|p=87}}

The municipality has two exclaves in the mainland: Monnegre (between the municipalities of [[San Vicente del Raspeig / Sant Vicent del Raspeig|San Vicente del Raspeig]], [[Mutxamel]], [[Busot]] and [[Jijona]]),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alicante.es/sites/default/files/documentos/noticias/catalogo-proteccion-alicante-version-modificada/anejo-1-estudio-paisaje-version-modificada-24012017.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://www.alicante.es/sites/default/files/documentos/noticias/catalogo-proteccion-alicante-version-modificada/anejo-1-estudio-paisaje-version-modificada-24012017.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|publisher=Ayuntamiento de Alicante|title=Estudio de paisaje del municipio de alicante|page=34}}</ref> and [[Cabeçó d'Or]]; the latter comprises part of the namesake Cabeçó d'Or mountain (including the summit, 1209 metres above sea level).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://alicantepress.com/art/42027/busot-reparara-el-vertice-geodesico-del-cabeco-dor|website=Alicante Press|title=Busot reparará el vértice geodésico del Cabeçó D'Or|date=7 April 2019}}</ref> The small island of [[Tabarca]], 8 [[nautical mile]]s to the south of the city, also belongs to the municipality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://info.igme.es/ielig/LIGInfo.aspx?codigo=BE003|title=Isla de Tabarca|publisher=[[Geological and Mining Institute of Spain|Instituto Geológico y Minero de España]]}}</ref>

The foot of the main staircase of the City Hall Building (''[[Ayuntamiento]]'') is the zero point (''cota cero''), used as the point of reference for measuring the height above or below sea level of any point in Spain, due to the marginal tidal variations of the Mediterranean sea at Alicante.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.alicante-ayto.es/cultura/edificios_singulares/ayuntamiento_alicante.html |title=Ayuntamiento de Alicante, Edificios Singulares |work=alicante-ayto.es |language=es |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610190844/http://www.alicante-ayto.es/cultura/edificios_singulares/ayuntamiento_alicante.html |archive-date=10 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Port of Alicante 7.jpg|thumb|left|Port of Alicante]]
Until the [[Great Recession]], Alicante was one of the fastest-growing cities in Spain. The boom depended partly on tourism directed to the beaches of the [[Costa Blanca]] and particularly on the second residence-construction boom which started in the 1960s and revived again by the late 1990s. [[Tertiary sector|Services]] and public administration also play a major role in the city's economy. The construction boom has raised many environmental concerns and both the local autonomous government and city council are under scrutiny by the European Union. The construction surge was the subject of hot debates among politicians and citizens alike. The latest of many public battles concerns the plans of the Port Authority of Alicante to construct an industrial estate on reclaimed land in front of the city's coastal strip, in breach of local, national, and European regulations. (See [[Port of Alicante]] for details).

[[File:Vista aerea ciudad luz.jpg|thumb|right|Ciudad de la Luz]]
The city serves as the headquarters of the [[European Union Intellectual Property Office]] and a sizeable population of European public workers live there.

The campus of the [[University of Alicante]] lies in [[San Vicente del Raspeig]], bordering the city of Alicante to the north. More than 25,000 students attend the university.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://memoria.ua.es/es/comunidad-universitaria/alumnado.html |title=Annual Report for academic year 2018–19 |work=University of Alicante |language=es}}</ref>

Between 2005 and 2012 [[Ciudad de la Luz]] (''Ciutat de la Llum''), one of the largest film studios in Europe, had its base in Alicante. The studio shot Spanish and international movies such as [[Asterix at the Olympic Games (film)|''Asterix at the Olympic Games'']] by Frédéric Forestier and Thomas Langmann, and [[Manolete (film)|''Manolete'']] by [[Menno Meyjes]]. It was shut down in 2012 for violating European competition law.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cineytele.com/2019/02/14/adios-definitivo-a-ciudad-de-la-luz/|title=Adiós a los estudios de cine Ciudad de la Luz {{!}} Cine y Tele|date=14 February 2019 |access-date=2019-02-27}}</ref>

== Government and administration ==
{{See also|List of mayors of Alicante}}
[[Luis Barcala]] of the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] has been the mayor of Alicante since 19 April 2018. He became mayor after the resignation of Gabriel Echávarri, when the councillor Nerea Belmonte defected from Guanyar Alacant and refused to support the Socialist Party replacement candidate Eva Montesinos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/comunidad-valenciana/2018-04-19/pp-recupera-alicante-fracaso-psoe-transfuga-podemos_1552189/|title=El PP recupera Alicante al fracasar el pacto del PSOE con la tránsfuga de Podemos.

[[File:Salón de Plenos del Ayuntamiento de Alicante.JPG|thumb|right|Plenary hall where the municipal council meets.]]
Gabriel Echávarri of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Party]] (PSOE) was the mayor of the city from 13 June 2015 until April 2018, following the [[2015 Spanish local elections|municipal elections]] on 24 May 2015. He was supported by the votes from his group (6), plus those from leftist parties [[Guanyar Alacant]] (6) and [[Compromís]] (3), as well as from the centre-right party [[Ciudadanos]] (6). The [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (''Partido Popular'', PP), with only 8 elected seats, lost the majority. On April he resigned due to various judicial issues and was temporarily substituted by the councillor Eva Montesinos.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sánchez|first=Manrique C.|title=El alcalde de Alicante firma su dimisión, que hará efectiva el 9 de abril|url=https://elpais.com/ccaa/2018/03/23/valencia/1521811043_325775.html|date=23 March 2018|access-date=18 April 2018|work=El País|issn=1134-6582|language=es}}</ref>

In the previous [[2011 Spanish local elections|municipal elections]] of May 2011, [[Sonia Castedo]] of People's Party won the elections with an [[Majority|absolute majority]], but resigned in December 2014 due to her involvement in several corruption scandals, at present being under investigation. Her fellow party member [[Miguel Valor]] went on to become mayor up until Echávarri's election.

==Climate==
Alicante has mild winter temperatures, hot and sultry summers, and little rain, concentrated in equinoctial periods. Like the rest of the [[Province of Alicante]] itself, which has a range of dry climate types, the city has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] (''BSh'') according to the [[Köppen climate classification]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/documentos/es/divulgacion/publicaciones/Atlas-climatologico/Atlas.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.aemet.es/documentos/es/divulgacion/publicaciones/Atlas-climatologico/Atlas.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=Iberian Climate Atlas |website=www.aemet.es |access-date=9 August 2021}}</ref> It is one of the driest cities in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web |last=iAgua |first=redaccion |date=2017-03-22 |title=¿Cuáles son las zonas más áridas de España? |url=https://www.iagua.es/noticias/espana/eltiempoes/17/03/22/cuales-son-zonas-mas-aridas-espana |access-date=2024-03-19 |website=iAgua |language=es}}</ref> Daily variations in temperature are generally small because of the stabilising influence of the sea, although occasional periods of westerly wind can produce temperature changes of {{convert|15|C-change|0|abbr=on}} or more. Seasonal temperature variations are also relatively small, meaning that winters are mild and summers are hot. During the summer, due to the evaporation of warm Mediterranean waters, air [[humidity]] levels are high, making the day and night stuffy for much of the season. These high humidity levels increase the [[heat index]].

The average rainfall is {{convert|284.5|mm|1|abbr=on}} per year. The [[cold drop]] means that September and October are the wettest months. Rarely, the rainfall can be torrential, reaching over {{convert|100|mm|0|abbr=on}} in a 24-hour period, leading to severe flooding. Because of this irregularity, only 35 rainy days are observed on average per year, and the annual number of sunshine hours is more than 3,000.

The record maximum temperature of {{convert|42.0|°C|1|abbr=on}} was observed on 13 August 2022.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/es/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/efemerides_extremos*?w=0&k=val&l=8019&datos=det&x=8019&m=13&v=TMX |title=Alicante/Alacant Aeropuerto |work=Agencia Estatal de Meteorología |access-date=15 January 2017}}</ref> The record minimum temperature of {{convert|-4.6|°C|1|abbr=on}} was recorded on 12 February 1956.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/es/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/efemerides_extremos*?w=0&k=val&l=8025&datos=det&x=8025&m=13&v=todos |title=Valores extremos.

==Transportation==
[[Alicante Airport]] outranks the [[Valencia Airport]], being the busiest airport in the [[Valencian Community]], and among the busiest airports in Spain after [[Madrid Airport|Madrid]], [[Barcelona Airport|Barcelona]], [[Palma de Mallorca Airport|Palma de Mallorca]] and [[Málaga Airport|Málaga]]. It is connected with Madrid and Barcelona by frequent [[Iberia Airlines|Iberia]] and [[Vueling Airlines|Vueling]] flights, and with many Western European cities through carriers such as [[Ryanair]], [[EasyJet]] and [[Jet2]]. There are also regular flights to [[Algeria]].

[[Alicante railway station]] is used by [[Cercanías Murcia/Alicante]] [[commuter rail]] services linking Alicante with suburbs and [[Murcia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/cercanias/murciaalicante/ |title=Murcia/Alicante |work=RENFE Cercanías}}</ref> Long-range [[Renfe]] trains run frequently to [[Madrid]], [[Barcelona]], and [[Valencia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://horarios.renfe.es/hir/index.jsp?page=hjhir120.jsp&O=60911&D=?AF=AA&MF=MM&DF=DD&SF=NaN&ID=i&PGM=hir1 |title=RENFE destinations from ALACANT-TERMINAL |publisher=Horarios.renfe.es |access-date=11 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720143355/http://horarios.renfe.es/hir/index.jsp?page=hjhir120.jsp&O=60911&D=%3F&AF=AA&MF=MM&DF=DD&SF=NaN&ID=i&PGM=hir1 |archive-date=20 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 2013, the [[Madrid–Levante high-speed rail network]] was extended to Alicante station, allowing [[AVE]] [[high-speed rail]] services to link to [[Madrid]] via [[Villena AV railway station|Villena AV]], [[Albacete-Los Llanos railway station|Albacete-Los Llanos]] and [[Cuenca–Fernando Zóbel railway station|Cuenca-Fernando Zóbel]].

[[Alicante Tram|Alicante Metropolitan-Tram]] connects different parts within the city, its metropolitan area and with outlying settlements along [[Costa Blanca]] as well. {{As of|2020}}, electric [[tram-train]]s run up to [[Benidorm]], and diesel trains go further to [[Dénia]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fgvalicante.com/page.php?idioma=_en |title=TRAM Alicante |work=Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat Valenciana }}{{Dead link|date=August 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The city has regular [[ferry]] services to the [[Balearic Islands]] and [[Algeria]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aferry.co.uk/alicante-ferry-uk.htm |title=Alicante Ferry Port |work=Aferry.co.uk |access-date=11 March 2011 |archive-date=26 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226224904/http://www.aferry.co.uk/alicante-ferry-uk.htm }}</ref> The city is strongly fortified, with a spacious harbour.

==Main sights==
Amongst the most notable features of the city are the [[Castle of Santa Bárbara]] and the [[port of Alicante]]. The latter was the subject of bitter controversy in 2006–2007 as residents battled, successfully, to keep it from being changed into an industrial estate.

The Santa Bárbara castle is situated on [[Mount Benacantil]], overlooking the city. The tower (''La Torreta'') at the top, is the oldest part of the castle, while part of the lowest zone and the walls were constructed later in the 18th century.

The promenade ''Explanada de España'', lined by palm trees, is paved with 6.5 million marble floor tiles creating a wavy form. The Promenade extends from the Port of Alicante to the Gran Vía and ends at the famous statue of Mark Hersch. For the people of Alicante, the promenade is the meeting place for the traditional Spanish ''paseo'', or stroll along the waterfront in the evenings, and a venue for outdoor musical concerts. At the end of the promenade is a monument by the artist Bañuls of the 19th century.

''Barrio de la Santa Cruz'' is a colourful quarter of the old city, situated southwest of Santa Bárbara castle. Its small houses climb up the hill leading to the walls and the castle, through narrow streets decorated with flags and tubs of flowers.

''L'Ereta Park'' is situated on the foothills of Mount Benacantil. It runs from the Santa Bárbara castle down to the old part of Alicante and consists of several levels, routes, decks, and rest stops which offer a panoramic view overlooking the city.

''El Palmeral Park'' is one of the favourite parks of Alicante's citizens. It includes walking trails, children's playgrounds, ponds and brooks, picnic tables, and an auditorium for concerts.
