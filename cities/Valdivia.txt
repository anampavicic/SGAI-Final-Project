'''Valdivia''' ({{IPA|es|balˈdiβja}}; [[Mapuche language|Mapuche]]: Ainil) is a [[List of cities in Chile|city]] and [[Communes of Chile|commune]] in [[Southern Chile|southern]] [[Chile]], administered by the Municipality of Valdivia. The city is named after its [[Organizational founder|founder]], [[Pedro de Valdivia]], and is located at the confluence of the [[Calle-Calle River|Calle-Calle]], [[Valdivia River|Valdivia]], and [[Cau-Cau River|Cau-Cau]] Rivers, approximately {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} east of the coastal towns of [[Corral, Chile|Corral]] and [[Niebla, Chile|Niebla]]. Since October 2007, Valdivia has been the capital of [[Los Ríos Region]] and is also the capital of [[Valdivia Province]].

The city of Valdivia and the [[Chiloé Archipelago]] were once the two southernmost outliers of the [[Spanish Empire]].

{{History of Valdivia}}
{{Main|History of Valdivia}}

===Pre-Hispanic times (12,000 BC – 1543)===
The area around Valdivia may have been populated since 12,000 – 11,800 [[Before Christ|BC]], according to archaeological discoveries in [[Monte Verde]]<ref>[[Dillehay, Tom]], ''Monteverde: A Late Pleistocene Settlement in Chile'' (Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, 1989)</ref> (less than 200&nbsp;km south of Valdivia), which would place it about a thousand years before the [[Clovis culture]] in North America. This challenges the [[models of migration to the New World|"Clovis First" model of migration to the New World]]. Researchers speculate that the first inhabitants of Valdivia and Chile travelled to America by [[watercraft]] and not across a land-bridge in the [[Bering Strait]].

During at least the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Middle Archaic]], southern Chile was populated by indigenous groups who shared a common [[archaeological culture|lithic culture]] called the [[Chan-Chan|Chan-Chan Complex]], named for the archaeological site of [[Chan-Chan]] located some 35&nbsp;km north of Valdivia along the coast.<ref name=pino>[[Mario Pino Quivira|Pino, Mario]] and Navarro, Rayen. [http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0716-02082005000100004&script=sci_arttext "Geoarqueología del sitio arcaico Chan-Chan 18"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926141856/http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0716-02082005000100004&script=sci_arttext |date=2012-09-26 }} {{in lang|es}}. ''[[Andean Geology|Revista Geológica de Chile]]'', 2005.</ref>

According to the polygenetic theory of the French scholar Paul Rivet, people from Melanesia, Polynesia, Australia and northern Asia arrived, in a period between 30 and 4 millennia ago, to the coasts of the New World, sailing in improvised boats.

One of the most suggestive hypotheses of the entire polygenetic theory is the probable trip that some members of the Japanese Jōmon culture made to the New World and its strong influence on the Valdivia culture, which developed in present-day Ecuador in the third millennium BC.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Was Jōmon the origin of the Valdivia culture? • Neperos |url=https://www.neperos.com/article/s56ni3802925446e |website=Neperos.com|date=5 December 2023 }}</ref>  <!--Expand - tell something about this culture -->

There was also a very early [[Valdivia culture]] on the coast of [[Ecuador]], but it is not related to the city of Valdivia. This archaeological culture flourished near the small village of Valdivia in Ecuador between 3500 BCE and 1500 BCE.

====Ainil====
By the time of the arrival of the Spanish [[conquistador]]es, Valdivia was inhabited by the [[Huilliche]] ([[Mapudungun]] for ''People of the South''). The Huilliche and [[Mapuche]] were both referred to by the Spaniards as ''Araucanos''. Their main language was a variant of Mapudungun, the Mapuche language.

A large village called ''Ainil'' stood where present-day downtown Valdivia has been developed. The Huilliche called the river, ''Ainilebu'' (now known as the Valdivia River). ''Ainil'' seemed to have been an important trade center; it was a port on the sea and had access to the interior via the network of the [[Río Cruces|Cruces]] and [[Calle-Calle River|Calle-Calle]] rivers, both tributaries of the Valdivia. ''Ainil'' may be described as "a kind of little [[Venice]]," as it had large areas of wetlands and canals. Since that period, most of these waterways and wetlands have been drained or filled. The market in ''Ainil'' received [[shellfish]] and [[fish]] from the coast, [[legume]]s from [[Punucapa]], and other foods from [[San José de la Mariquina]], an agricultural zone northeast of Valdivia.<ref name="darwin"/> A remnant of this ancient trade is the modern ''Feria Fluvial'' (English: Riverside Market) on the banks of Valdivia River. The surroundings of Valdivia were described as extensive plains having a large population that cultivated [[potatoes]], [[maize]], [[quinoa]] and [[legumes]], among other crops.<ref name="marino">Mariño de Lobera, Pedro, ''Crónica del reino de Chile, Colección de historiadores de Chile'', Imprenta del Ferrocarril, 1865. Available in www.memoriachilena.cl</ref> The population has been estimated by some historians as 30 to 40 thousand inhabitants as of 1548,<ref>[[Gabriel Guarda|Guarda, Gabriel]]. ''Nueva historia de Valdivia'' (Editorial Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, 2001)</ref> based on descriptions made by the conquistadors. [[Pedro Mariño de Lobera]], an early conquistador and [[chronicler]], wrote that there were half a million Indians living within ten [[League (unit)#Spain|leagues]] (one league is roughly 4.2&nbsp;km) from the city.<ref name=marino/> Other historians consider these numbers too high and argue that early Spaniards usually exaggerated in their descriptions.

Later the British naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] observed that "there is not much cleared land near Valdivia."<ref name="darwin"/> This suggests that pre-Hispanic agriculture in Valdivia was far more extensive than the agriculture practiced in the early 19th century at the time of his visit.

===First Spanish city (1544–1604)===
{{See also|Dutch expedition to Valdivia}}
[[File:Juan Bautista Pastene.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Idealized illustration of [[Juan Bautista Pastene|Pastene]] from [[Alonso de Ovalle]]'s "Histórica relación del Reyno de Chile"]]

The first European to visit [[Corral Bay|Valdivia River's estuary]] was the [[Genoa|Genoese]] captain [[Juan Bautista Pastene]], who took possession of it in 1544 in the name of the Spanish king, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. He named the river after the Governor of Chile [[Pedro de Valdivia]].<ref name=BHV/>

Pedro de Valdivia later travelled by land to the river described by Pastene, and founded the city of Valdivia in 1552 as ''Santa María la Blanca de Valdivia''.<ref name=BHV/> It was the southernmost Spanish settlement in the Americas at the time of the founding. Following the establishment of the church of ''Santa María la Blanca'' in Valdivia, more buildings were constructed. [[Mariño de Lobera]] described it as "the second city in the [[Kingdom of Chile]]".<ref name=marino/> Many of Chile's most influential conquistadors and future governors were granted land in Valdivia, such as [[Jerónimo de Alderete]], [[Rodrigo de Quiroga]], [[Francisco de Villagra|Francisco]] and [[Pedro de Villagra]], apart from Pedro de Valdivia himself.

[[Jerónimo de Vivar|Jerónimo de Bibar]], a chronicler who witnessed the founding wrote:<ref name="Vivar">[[Jerónimo de Vivar]] – Crónica y relación copiosa y verdadera de los reynos de Chile – Ended in 1558. Transcription of Irving Leonard published by ''Fondo Histórico y Bibliográfico José Toribio Medina'', Santiago de Chile, 1966</ref>

{{quote|"Having the governor seen such good [[comarca]] and site for populate a city and riverside of such good river, and having such good harbour he founded a city and named it ''ciudad de Valdivia'', and he assigned [[Alcalde]]s and a [[town council]]."}}

After Pedro de Valdivia's death, the war with the [[Mapuche]]s, called the [[Arauco War|War of Arauco]], continued. The Spanish made many attempts to defeat the Mapuche and defend the cities and forts built on their territory. On March 17 of 1575 the city was damaged by [[1575 Valdivia earthquake|a massive earthquake]]. It has since been likened to the [[Great Chilean earthquake]] of 1960 in terms of damage.<ref name="BHV">{{cite web | url = http://www.buscalibros.cl/libros.php?c=226 | year = 1971 | publisher = Editorial Francisco de Aguirre | title = Breve Historia de Valdivia | access-date = 2007-09-17 | archive-date = 2007-02-18 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070218034335/http://www.buscalibros.cl/libros.php?c=226 | url-status = live }}</ref>

Until 1575, the Huilliche of Valdivia did not organize any notable resistance against the Spanish. They had fought as ''[[Indios amigos]]'' with the Spanish against the northern Mapuche in the Arauco War.  But that year 4,000 Indians who had been fighting in Martín Ruiz de Gamboa's army rebelled after returning to the area of Valdivia.

[[File:Pedro de Valdivia.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Picture of [[Pedro de Valdivia]], conquistador of Chile and founder of Valdivia]]

During the 16th century, the economy of Valdivia was sustained by trade in agricultural products from nearby areas and by the coining and export of [[placer deposit|placer]] [[gold]] from [[Villarrica, Chile|Villarrica]], [[Madre de Dios Mine|Madre de Dios]] and [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]]. In Lima and the rest of Chile, people referred to all the gold from these sources as "''gold from Valdivia.''" Many merchants of Lima had envoys in Valdivia, and the city developed a large ship building industry. It produced the largest ships in the [[Kingdom of Chile]].

After the demoralising [[Battle of Curalaba]] in 1598, in which the Mapuche killed [[governor of Chile|governor]] [[Martín García Óñez de Loyola|Óñez de Loyola]], the Mapuche and Huilliche made a mass rebellion. The Indians destroyed or forced the abandonment of all the Spanish settlements and forts in their lands, in what came to be known as the [[Destruction of the Seven Cities]]. On the morning of 24 November 1599, the Huilliche attacked the city and massacred its inhabitants, some few being rescued by the ships in the harbour. The border of the Spanish Empire shifted north of the [[Bío-Bío River]]. Valdivia was re-established but it was a Spanish enclave surrounded by native Huilliche territory. Together with [[Castro, Chile]] on the island of [[Chiloé Island|Chiloé]], it was one of the southernmost colonies of the Empire.

Eleven days after the first destruction of Valdivia, a group of 270 Spanish soldiers arrived from Perú.<ref name=BHV/> The commander of the troops, colonel Francisco del Campo was convinced that the city of Valdivia needed to be repopulated. After Francisco del Campo's expedition left, the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] corsair Sebastian de Cordes occupied the site of Valdivia for some months, giving the Dutch government information about this abandoned part of the Spanish Empire. The Spaniards returned on 13 March 1602, when captain Francisco Hernández Ortiz established a fort on the ruins of the city. On September 24 natives attacked the fort unsuccessfully, but laid siege. The Spaniards could not acquire food or supplies, and on 3 February 1604 abandoned the fort, with the last starving survivors rescued by ship.

===Ruins of Valdivia and Dutch occupation (1604–1645)===
{{Further|Dutch expedition to Valdivia}}
The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] governor of the [[East Indies]] [[Hendrik Brouwer]], learned about the situation in Valdivia, and decided to establish a base there for further attacks against the Viceroy of Peru.  This plan was well accepted as the Netherlands was at war with Spain.  The Dutch had previously taken the North of [[Brazil]] from the [[Iberian Union|Spanish-Portuguese crown]], and the idea of creating a South American empire was attractive.  In spite of his advanced age, Hendrik Brouwer left his post as governor in the East Indies to personally lead the expedition.  The Dutch fleet destroyed the Fort of [[Carelmapu]] and the city of [[Castro, Chile|Castro]] before arriving at [[Corral Bay]] at the mouth of the Valdivia River.  Hendrik Brouwer died the 7th of August in [[Puerto Inglés]] while waiting for better winds to sail north to Valdivia.  [[John Maurice of Nassau]] while in charge of the Dutch part of Brazil had equipped the expedition and had secretly appointed Elias Herckman as commander if Brouwer died.  Herckman finally occupied the ruins of Valdivia in 1643, renaming it '''Brouwershaven'''. The Dutch did not find the gold mines they expected and the hostility of the natives forced them to leave on 28 October 1643.<ref name=BHV/>

===Second Spanish city (1645–1810)===
[[Pedro Álvarez de Toledo y Leiva]] Viceroy of Peru (1639–1648) knew of the strategic importance of Valdivia and decided to repopulate and fortify it once and for all.  He financed partly the expedition to repopulate Valdivia with his own capital.<ref name=BHV/> The contingent in charge of the mission was organized in Peru and consisted of seventeen ships filled with building materials and supplies that astounded contemporaries by its magnitude.<ref name=unesco/> The local government of Chile could not secure Valdivia as it was engaged in continuous war with the Mapuches and was deeply dependent on the [[Real Situado]], an annual payment of silver from [[Potosí]] to finance the army of Chile.

Beginning in the mid-18th century, Valdivia left behind its past as an enclave and a period of agricultural expansion begun. The expansion, that mainly directed to the south, was done mostly by pacific means, but hostilities with indigenous Huilliches did occur. After the Valdivian colonization had reached [[Bueno River]], Spanish authorities pushed for connecting the city of Valdivia with the settlements at [[Chacao Channel]] by a road.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Couyoumdjian |first=Juan Ricardo |date=2009 |title=Reseña de "La frontera de arriba en Chile colonial.

===Independence and growth (1810–1959)===
{{Further|German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|1960 Valdivia earthquake}}
[[File:Tomadevaldivia.JPG|thumb|250px|left|A painting of the assault on Corral fort]]

Self-governing juntas appeared in [[Spanish America]] and Spain after [[Napoleon]] occupied Spain and held the Spanish king [[Fernando VII]] captive. Many juntas, as was the case of Chile, declared plans to rule their territory in the absence of the legitimate king. At the time of the first governing junta of [[Chile]] in 1810 the Valdivian governor, an [[Irishman]], Albert Alexander Eagar, led the celebration of what was seen as an affirmation of the legitimacy of the Spanish king. However, Valdivian independentists, such as [[Camilo Henríquez]], saw an opportunity to gain absolute independence from Spain, organized a coup on 1 November 1811, and joined other Chilean cities that were already revolting against the old order.<ref name=BHV/> Four months after the coup, on 16 March 1812 a counterrevolutionary coup took control of the city and created a War Council. The War Council broke trade relations with the rest of Chile and confirmed Valdivia's loyalty to the Spanish government.<ref name=BHV/>

Even after several defeats of the Spanish troops during the [[Chilean Independence War]], Valdivia and [[Chiloé Island|Chiloé]] remained loyal to the Spanish King. By 1820 the newly created [[Chilean Navy]], commanded by [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Thomas Cochrane]], [[Capture of Valdivia|captured Valdivia]], but failed to liberate Chiloé. Cochrane's land-based attack took the Spanish by surprise, avoiding a direct confrontation with the highly defended forts at the entrance to the Valdivia River. When loyal troops in Valdivia heard the news about the fall of Corral they sacked the city and fled south to reinforce Chiloé, passing by [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]].<ref name=BHV/>

[[File:CamiloHenríquez.JPG|thumb|Friar [[Camilo Henríquez]], born in Valdivia, was one of the [[List of national founders|founding fathers]] of the Republic of Chile.]]

Chilean Supreme Director, and [[Libertadores|Libertador]], [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] founded the city of [[La Unión, Chile|La Unión]] south of Valdivia in 1821, to secure the way to Osorno, a city that had been repopulated in 1796 by his father [[Ambrosio O'Higgins]]. Valdivia had been a province of the [[Kingdom of Chile|General Captaincy of Chile]] and was in 1826 incorporated as one of the eight provinces of Chile.<ref name=BHV/>

On February 20, 1835, Valdivia was affected by the worst earthquake in the area in several decades, an event witnessed by [[Charles Darwin]].<ref name="darwin">{{gutenberg|no=3704|name=The Voyage of the Beagle ''by Charles Darwin''}}</ref> He also stated that ''"there is not much cleared land near Valdivia"''<ref name="darwin"/> which contrasted with the description made by early Spaniards of large fields and extensive croplands.

The expansion and economic development of the city were limited in the early 19th century. To jump-start economic development, the Chilean government initiated a highly focussed immigration program under [[Bernhard Eunom Philippi]] and later [[Vicente Pérez Rosales]] as government agents. Through this program, thousands of [[Germans]] settled in the area, incorporating then-modern technology and know-how to develop agriculture and industry. While immigrants that arrived to the [[Llanquihue Province|Llanquihue]] area were often poor farmers, Valdivia received more educated immigrants, including political exiles and merchants. Some of the immigrants that arrived in Valdivia established workshops and built new industries. One of the most famous immigrants was [[Carlos Anwandter]], an exile from [[Luckenwalde]] who arrived in Valdivia in 1850 and in 1858 founded Chile's first German school. Other Germans left the city and became settlers, drawn by the promise of free land. They were often given forested land, which they cleared to turn into farms.<ref>Otero, Luis, La Huella del Fuego: Historia de los bosques y cambios en el paisaje del sur de  Chile (Valdivia, Editorial Pehuen)</ref> Native [[Mapuche]] and [[Huilliche]] either sold their land or were pushed into [[Reservation (Chile)|reservation]]s. The Osorno department of Valdivia Province was moved to [[Llanquihue Province]] (created in 1853) as consequence of German immigration to the Llaquihue area.

Never will have the country that adopts us as its children, reason to repent of such illustrated, human and generous proceeding,... |[[Carlos Anwandter]]}}

Valdivia prospered with industries, including shipyards, the Hoffmann [[gristmill]], the Rudloff shoe factory, the Anwandter beer company and many more. The [[steel mill]]s of [[Corral, Chile|Corral]] were the largest recorded private investment in Chile at the time, and were the first steel mills in [[South America]]. In 1891 Valdivia became a [[Communes of Chile|commune]] according to a law that created such subdivisions. After the [[Malleco Viaduct]] was built in 1890 the railroads advanced further south, reaching Valdivia in 1895. The first passenger train arrived in 1899. In 1909 a fire destroyed 18 [[city block]]s in downtown Valdivia,<ref name=BHV/> which were rebuilt with modern concrete buildings. By 1911 lumber production, from clearing of native forests, became the most important industry. Cattle-raising was a growing industry, and wheat was grown on the cleared lands. Lumber, cattle, leather, flour and beer were exported. In 1895 the city's population was 8,062 inhabitants and was estimated at 9,704 in 1902.

The economic prosperity of Valdivia continued throughout the first half of the 20th century. In 1917 the first "Valdivian Week" (Spanish: ''Semana Valdiviana'') was celebrated. Chile's oldest beauty contest, "Queen of The Rivers" (Spanish: ''Reina de Los Ríos'') began the same year. The city evolved as an early tourist center in Chile, while popular songs that named Valdivia and the [[Calle-Calle River]] made it better known in Chilean popular culture. The [[Pedro de Valdivia Bridge]] crossing the Valdivia River was built in 1954. Valdivia came to be one of the most important industrial centers in Chile together with the capital [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]] and the main port city, [[Valparaíso]].

The commercial and human flux Valdivia suffered two setbacks in the early 20th century, first the connection of [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]] by railroad to central Chile which meant that Valdivia lost the quality of being the port that connected Osorno to [[Central Chile]].<ref>[http://mingaonline.uach.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0718-64281998000200006&lng=es&nrm=iso Investigación aplicada sobre Geografía Urbana: Un caso práctico en la ciudad de Valdivia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025010536/http://mingaonline.uach.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0718-64281998000200006&lng=es&nrm=iso|date=2014-10-25}} Víctor Figueroa, Jorge Gayoso, Edgardo Oyarzun, Lenia Planas[[Gestion Turistica]], [[UACh]].</ref> Later on 1911 the opening of the [[Panama Canal]] meant a decrease in ship traffic all over Chile since ships travelling from the north Atlantic to north Pacific no longer had to pass through the [[Straits of Magellan]] or visit any Chilean port.

===Great Chilean earthquake and Los Lagos Region (1960–2006)===
{{See also|Great Chilean earthquake|Riñihuazo|Los Ríos Region}}
[[File:Valdivia after earthquake, 1960.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A street in Valdivia after the [[Great Chilean earthquake|earthquake]] of 22 May 1960]]

On May 22, 1960, Chile suffered the most powerful earthquake ever recorded, rating 9.5<ref name="earthquake"/> on the [[moment magnitude scale]], with Valdivia being the most affected city. The earthquake generated devastating [[tsunami]]s that affected Japan, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, and [[Hawaii]]. Spanish-colonial [[Valdivian Fort System|forts around Valdivia]] were severely damaged, while soil subsidence destroyed buildings, deepened local rivers, and created wetlands of the [[Río Cruces y Chorocomayo]] – a new aquatic park north of the city.

Large sections of the city flooded after the earthquake, and a landslide near the [[Tralcán]] Mount [[riñihuazo|dammed the Riñihue Lake]]. Water levels in Lake Riñihue rose more than {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}, raising the danger of a catastrophic break and of destroying everything downriver. Government authorities drew plans for evacuating the city, but many people left on their own. Danger to the city was reduced after a large team of workers opened a drainage channel in the landslide; water levels of the lake slowly returned to normal levels. There is evidence that a similar landslide and earthquake happened in 1575.<ref name=BHV/> After the Great Chilean earthquake Valdivia's economy and political status declined. Much of the city was destroyed and many inhabitants left.

The [[1973 Chilean coup d'état]] and the military's actions that followed brought dozens of detainees to Valdivia and saw the imposing of a nationwide [[curfew]]. In October a group of 12 young men, among them [[José Gregorio Liendo]], were brought from the [[Complejo Forestal y Maderero Panguipulli]] in the Andes to be executed in Valdivia by [[firing squad]] due to alleged participation in the [[Neltume#History|assault on Neltume police station]] and "guerrilla activities".

By 1974, the military junta reorganized the political divisions of Chile and declared Valdivia a province of the [[Los Lagos Region]] with [[Puerto Montt]] as the regional capital. Many Valdivians resented the decision, and felt theirs should have been the legitimate regional capital—while Valdivia was founded in 1552, and had resisted [[Corral Bay Forts|pirate attacks]], [[Arauco War|hostile natives]] and several earthquakes, Puerto Montt was a relatively new city founded only in 1853 (three hundred and one years later).

Since the liberalization of the economy in Chile in the 1980s the forestry sector in Valdivia boomed, first by exporting wood chips to Japan from [[Corral, Chile|Corral]] and then by producing [[woodpulp]] in Mariquina (50&nbsp;km northeast of Valdivia). This led to deforestation and substitution of native [[Valdivian temperate rainforests]] to plant pines and [[eucalyptus]], but also created new jobs for people with limited education. Valdivia also benefitted from the development of [[salmon]] [[aquaculture]] in the 1990s, but to a much lesser extent than places such as [[Puerto Montt]] and Chiloé.

==Culture==
[[File:Regiondelosrios.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Picture of [[Michelle Bachelet]]'s visit to Valdivia in 2007, in which she confirmed the creation of [[Los Ríos Region]]]]

Valdivia is often promoted for its unique characteristics, that make it different from other cities in Chile: Valdivia has an early Spanish colonial past, plus a later history of [[German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|German colonization]]. Both eras left visible landmarks such as the [[Valdivian Fort System|forts of Corral Bay]] and the German-style wood houses. The governments of Spain and Germany currently maintain honorary [[consul (representative)|consul]]ates in Valdivia. The city is commonly seen as a tourist magnet in Chile, and sometimes described as ''La Perla del Sur'' (''The Pearl of the South'') and as ''La ciudad mas linda de Chile'' (''Chile's most beautiful city'').
Every year during the summer months of January and February the municipality organizes many free cultural events along the river site, such as concerts, sporting events, and other entertainment. To mark and celebrate the end of the touristic summer months, halfway through February all entertainment reaches its climax with the celebration of ''noche Valdiviana'' (Valdivian night). During this night many local groups and communities present themselves on boats during a night parade over the river. Every boat has its own theme related with one theme of that year. At the end a jury picks the winners in different categories. The parade is by tradition started by a boat which presents ''la reina de los ríos''. In recent years Valdivians have showed an increasing interest in nature and [[ecotourism]]. An example of this was the formation of ''[[Acción por los Cisnes]]'' an ecologist group formed to protect black-necked swans and the natural environment that surrounds the city, particularly wetlands created or expanded by the [[Great Chilean earthquake]]. With the founding of [[Southern University of Chile|Universidad Austral]] in 1954 and the arrival of the [[Centro de Estudios Científicos|CECS]] research center, Valdivia is now considered a major research center in Chile, particularly in areas related to nature such a [[glaciology]] and [[ecology]]. The [[Great Chilean earthquake]] and the national government's creation of the [[Los Lagos Region]] were difficult for Valdivian society. Valdivians resented to be punished first by a major earthquake and then by being placed under the administration of what they perceived to be a less-deserving city, [[Puerto Montt]]. The recent creation of a new, smaller, but more independent region (Los Ríos), with Valdivia as its capital, reduced the previous stigma.

Valdivia's varied influences are reflected by its multicultural [[toponym]]s that include placenames of [[Mapudungun|Mapuche]], Spanish, [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] and German origin.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bernales Lillo |first=Mario |date=1984 |title=Aspectos diacrónicos en la toponimia de Valdivia |url=http://www.anales.uchile.cl/index.php/ANUC/article/viewFile/23061/24411 |journal=[[Anales de la Universidad de Chile]] |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=79–94 |language=es |access-date=2017-02-23 |archive-date=2017-02-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224132844/http://www.anales.uchile.cl/index.php/ANUC/article/viewFile/23061/24411 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Spanish colonial influences===
During much of the colonial period, Valdivia was essentially a military camp, a walled city surrounded by hostile natives. The coastal defenses and their garrisons made up a large part of the population. After several fires and earthquakes, nearly all buildings from this period were destroyed, with the exception of the military defenses. Valdivia's best known historical landmarks are now the two towers which were part of a former city wall, built by the Spaniards to defend the city, known as ''Torreones'': [[Torreón Los Canelos]] and [[Torreón del Barro]].

===German influences===
{{Main|German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue}}
[[File:Entrada_Cervecería_Kunstmann.jpg|thumb|[[Kunstmann]] Brewery, Valdivia, Chile]]

Since the first [[German people|Germans]] migrated to Valdivia in the mid-1840s, German cultural influence has been visible in the city. Germans in Valdivia settled mostly in the [[Isla Teja]] and [[Collico]] suburban areas. Until the building of [[Pedro de Valdivia Bridge]], inhabitants of [[Isla Teja]] lived isolated from the city, where it was common that children first learned to speak [[German language|German]] before Spanish. Nowadays, the [[German language]] is preserved by the ''[[Instituto Alemán Carlos Anwandter]]'' one of [[Latin America]]'s oldest German schools. German descendants also form Valdivia's oldest fire station ''Germania,'' located in Isla Teja.

German immigrants and their descendants formed their social club ''Club Alemán,'' which after [[World War II]] changed names to ''Club la Unión''. German workers once had their own club simply called ''El Alemán'' (The German).

Valdivia also hosts ''Bierfest Valdivia'', a celebration that could be described as a small, regional [[Oktoberfest]], despite being celebrated in late January or February of every year (during the local summer, when there is the largest influx of tourists). The main sponsor and organizer is [[Kunstmann]], a local [[beer]] company, founded by German nationals, but since bought out by the largest beer and beverages company in Chile (CCU).

==Demographics==
According to the 2002 [[census]] of the [[National Statistics Institute (Chile)|National Statistics Institute]], the commune of Valdivia spans an area of {{convert|1015.6|sqkm|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} and has 140,559 inhabitants (68,510 men and 72,049 women). Of these, 129,952 (92.5%) lived in [[urban area]]s and 10,607 (7.5%) in [[rural area]]s. Between the 1992 and 2002 censuses, the population grew by 15.1% (18,391 persons).<ref name="INE"/>

The city of Valdivia spans {{convert|42.39|sqkm|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} had a population of 127,750 and 35,217 homes, giving it a population density of {{convert|3013.7|PD/sqkm|0|abbr=on|sp=us}}. The commune is divided into 19 census districts with one recognized [[List of towns in Chile|town]], Niebla, with an area of {{convert|1.55|sqkm|sp=us}}, population of 2,202 (in 1,169 homes) and population density of {{convert|1420.6|PD/sqkm|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="INE"/>

Within the population, the presence of descendants of migrants of German origin and of Spanish origin also stands out, colonies that are grouped into different social, educational, sports and cultural institutions. 

===Arts and Scientific research===
The Southern University of Chile ([[Universidad Austral de Chile]], UACh), one of the original eight Chilean state universities, has its main campus in Valdivia. In the last decade Valdivia gained prestige as an important cultural and scientific venue: the [[Valdivia International Film Festival|Valdivia Film Festival]] became the most important in Chile, and the [[Centro de Estudios Científicos]] (CECS) is now housed in the recently modernized, German-style hotel Schuster located by the Valdivia River. [[Claudio Bunster]], a physicist and winner of Chile's National Prize in Exact Sciences, is the Director of CECS. Some research areas where CECS and UACH have gained widespread recognition include:

The city is surrounded by many nature reserves and large areas of forest plantations, wetlands and [[Valdivian temperate rainforest]] that, together with the numerous rivers that circle the city, have heightened the residents' awareness of living close to nature.

===Trivia===
In addition to being known as ''the City of Rivers'', Valdivia has also been called ''The pearl of the South,''  ''The key of the South seas'', ''Gibraltar of the Pacific'', and ''Chile's most beautiful city''. The nickname ''Valdilluvia'' is a mix of the Spanish word for rain – ''lluvia'' and Valdivia referring to the rainy climate of the city.

==Geography==
[[File:Txu-oclc-224571178-sj18-16.jpg|250px|thumb|Map of Valdivia and its surroundings]]

As part of the [[Chile]]an [[Patagonia]], the geography of the Valdivia area consists of wetlands and alluvial terraces. Several rivers, such as [[Cau-Cau River|Cau-Cau]], [[Calle-Calle River|Calle-Calle]] and [[Cruces River|Cruces]], join near the city forming the larger [[Valdivia River]]. Valdivia River in turn empties to [[Corral Bay]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]] just some 15&nbsp;km west of Valdivia. This river network made Valdivia a trade center even since [[Pre-Hispanic]] times. The city itself was built on a riverine terrace but expanded later over adjacent wetlands. Nowadays the city is virtually surrounded by hills by all sides except north where Valdivia's lowlands connect to the flatlands of San José de la Mariquina. Some hilly areas around Valdivia are covered with exotic forest species such as [[Douglas-fir]], ''[[Pinus radiata]]'' and ''[[Eucalyptus globulus]]''.

The city of Valdivia is situated above a sedimentary plain inside the [[Valdivian Coast Range]] (part of the larger [[Chilean Coast Range]]). The [[Cruces Rivers|Cruces]] and [[Calle-Calle River]]s penetrates from north respectively east. At the site of Valdivia they give origin to he range and reach the plains of Valdivia before turning west to [[Corral Bay]]. The backbone of the Valdivian Coast Range is the [[Bahía Mansa Metamorphic Complex]] which is a [[forearc]] high at the [[subduction]] front made of [[schist]]. Valdivia is above a sedimentary plain surrounded by low mountains of the coast range. Part of the sediments are [[volcaniclastic]] material such as [[clay]]s from the last [[interglacial]] period. Much of the sediments were carried as far as from the [[Andes]].<ref name="jara">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070630044726/http://www2.sernageomin.cl/pto_varas/Biblioteca/Articulos.pdf/JARA1.pdf Usos actuales y potenciales de los depositos sedimentarios del ultimo interglacial en Valdivia, X region, Chile] {{in lang|es}}</ref> Most of Valdivia's agricultural land corresponds to sedimentary deposits of the [[quaternary]].

Forested ranges of the Valdivian Coast Range surrounds Valdivia's plain by all side except to the north where the plain connects to Mariquina's agricultural flatlands through the wetlands of Cruces River. Valdivia lost a considerable surface of arable land, as a result of the [[Great Chilean earthquake]], because the soil surface went down {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}, creating and expanding existing wetlands and swamps.

==Climate==
Valdivia has an [[oceanic climate]]  with [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] influences.<ref name="dmch">[http://www.meteochile.cl/climas/climas_decima_region.html Dirección Meteorológica de Chile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229070118/http://www.meteochile.cl/climas/climas_decima_region.html |date=2008-02-29 }} {{in lang|es}}</ref> The natural vegetation of the region is the [[Valdivian temperate rainforest]].

During the summer months (December, January and February) the average temperature is about {{convert|17|C|F|0}}, while in winter the temperature descends to {{convert|8.5|C|F|1}}. The annual average temperature for [[Los Ríos Region]] is {{convert|11|C|F|0}}, while the mean temperature amplitude is 8.8&nbsp;°C (47.8&nbsp;°F) and the daily is 11&nbsp;°C (51.8&nbsp;°F).<ref name="dmch" /> Average annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is {{convert|1750|mm|in|-1|sp=us}}, distributed through the year, but primarily between March and October. Hail occurs with some frequency during winter, but snow falls rarely. The last times it snowed in Valdivia were in August 2020, July 2007, and in August 1995 during the so-called ''[[White Earthquake|Terremoto Blanco]]'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for White Earthquake). The [[Seven Lakes (Chile)|Seven Lakes]] in the interior help to keep an average relative humidity of 80% for the region as whole and there are no months with less than 75% average humidity.<ref name="dmch" /> The precipitation is generated by [[frontal system]]s that cross the zone, which produce cloudiness and few clear days.<ref name="dmch" /> The [[leeward]] effect of the [[Valdivian Coast Range]] is minimal due to its low height (715 m at [[Cerro Oncol]]) and the gap in the range at [[Valdivia River]]'s outflow to the [[Pacific Ocean]].{{clear}}

==Government and politics==
The commune of Valdivia is a third-level [[administrative division of Chile]] governed by a directly elected [[mayor]] (''[[alcalde]]'') and a [[municipal council]] (''consejales''). The city's current mayor is [[Carla Amtmann|Carla Andrea Amtmann Fecci]] of the [[Democratic Revolution]] party.  The prior mayor was Omar Sabat Guzmán of the [[Independent Democratic Union|Independiente UDI]].

Within the [[electoral divisions of Chile]], Valdivia is represented in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]] by Alfonso De Urresti ([[Socialist Party of Chile|PS]]) and Roberto Delmastro (RN) as part of the 53rd electoral district, together with [[Lanco, Chile|Lanco]], [[San José de la Mariquina|Mariquina]], [[Máfil]] and [[Corral, Chile|Corral]]. The commune is represented in the {{Current senators (16th senatorial constituency of Chile)}} as part of the 16th senatorial constituency (Los Ríos Region).

The creation of [[Los Ríos Region]] and [[Environmentalism|environmental]] issues have dominated the political scene of Valdivia in recent years. The communist lawyer Wladimir Riesco headed the legal actions against pulp mill enterprise [[CELCO]] after the deaths of [[black-necked swan]]s in [[Carlos Anwandter Nature Sanctuary]] in 2004.

===Ecological action===
In response to the alleged contamination of Cruces River by the [[Celulosa Arauco y Constitución|Celco]] cellulose pulp mill, a group of citizens formed the  ''Accion por los Cisnes'' (''Action for the Swans'') ecology group. Action for the Swans attracted the attention of the national newspapers and succeeded in temporarily closing down [[Valdivia Pulp Mill]] through a court order.<ref>Forbes List of Billionaires 2006</ref>

==Economy and tourism==
The city and commune of Valdivia rely heavily on [[silviculture]], the [[pulp and paper industry]] and other forestry-related activities (the harvesting and processing of wood from nearby plantations of [[Eucalyptus globulus|eucalyptus]] and [[Douglas fir]]s). Large businesses such as [[CELCO]], [[Bomasil]] and [[Louisiana-Pacific]] have established wood processing factories near Valdivia. [[Metallurgy]], [[naval construction]] and repairs are also important industries, with the companies of [[Asenav]] and Alwoplast based in the area.<ref>[http://www.inelosrios.cl/archivos/files/pdf/SistemaEstadisticoRegional/Los%20R%C3%ADos%20en%20Cifras_V4_Diciembre_2010(1).pdf INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE ESTADÍSTICAS DIRECCIÓN REGIONAL DE LOS RÍOS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040056/http://www.inelosrios.cl/archivos/files/pdf/SistemaEstadisticoRegional/Los%20R%C3%ADos%20en%20Cifras_V4_Diciembre_2010(1).pdf |date=2016-03-04 }} {{in lang|es}} INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE ESTADÍSTICAS DIRECCIÓN REGIONAL DE LOS RÍOS.

===Tourism===
{{See also|Ecotourism in the Valdivian Temperate Rainforest|Black Beer Festival}}
Valdivia is a historic tourist destination in Chile, valued for the beauty of the city and surrounding areas, the area's culture and its history. It is an all season city, but during the summer months in particular (December, January, February) tourism is a major source of income for Valdivia's economy. "Valdivian Week" (Spanish: ''Semana Valdiviana''), as it has been known since 1917, is a long-held tradition that dates back to the foundation of the city. Starting  February 9 each year,<ref>[http://www.munivaldivia.cl/www/municipal_valdivia/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1390&Itemid=803&lang=es CULTURA E IDENTIDAD DE VALDIVIA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425035207/http://www.munivaldivia.cl/www/municipal_valdivia/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1390&Itemid=803&lang=es |date=2014-04-25 }} {{in lang|es}}. munivaldivia.cl. Retrieved February 18, 2014.</ref> it commemorates the city's anniversary and also gives Valdivia the chance to promote itself as a tourism center. "Semana Valdiviana" features an allegorical parade of ships – a tradition that began in the seventeenth century as a protest against the Spaniard authorities – and also includes a big artisan market, fairground rides, and the election of the "queen" of [[Los Rios region|Los Rios]]. The week ends with [[Pyrotechnics|fireworks]] and theatre performances on the closing night, known as "Noche Valdiviana" (Valdivian Night).
The center of the city has a rich architectural heritage. One of its most visited buildings is the "Mercado Municipal" ("municipal market"),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.valdivia.cl/chile/valdivia_turismo/Mercado_de_Valdivia.shtml |title=Mercado Municipal de Valdivia |access-date=2014-04-24 |archive-date=2014-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425001712/http://www.valdivia.cl/chile/valdivia_turismo/Mercado_de_Valdivia.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref> a local produce market that is also now a gastronomic and cultural attraction. Also popular are the "Convento San Francisco" (Saint Francis Convent) and the European-style buildings dating back to the beginning of the 20th century, used today by the city's universities, cultural centers and government.

==Education==
===Universities and colleges===
Valdivia is home to several public and private [[school]]s and [[university|universities]]. The largest and oldest university is the [[Universidad Austral de Chile]] (UACh) that was founded by decree in 1954 as one of Chile's seven original [[Chilean Traditional Universities]]. Its main campus is located in [[Isla Teja]] but it has other minor campus and properties spread through the city and [[Zona Sur|southern Chile]]. Since the liberalization of higher education in Chile in the 1980s other universities have established campuses in Valdivia, including [[Universidad Arturo Prat]], [[Universidad San Sebastián]], [[Universidad Santo Tomás]] and [[Universidad de Los Lagos]].

===Schools===
Like in the rest of Chile, most of Valdivia's best schools are private. [[Instituto Alemán Carlos Anwandter]] (Deutsche Schule Valdivia) founded in 1858 is Chile's second oldest German school after the Instituto Alemán de Osorno (1854). Other notable private schools are [[Windsor School, Chile|Windsor School]] and Colegio San Luis de Alba. Among public schools [[Instituto Salesiano de Valdivia]], [[Liceo Rector Armando Robles Rivera]] and [[Liceo Comercial]] have reached good results.

==Sports==
Facilities for playing [[association football|football]], [[tennis]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[golf]], indoor [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], indoor and outdoor [[basketball]] and some other sports are available throughout the area. Rowing is practiced in Valdivia in three clubs: Club Deportivo Phoenix Valdivia, Club Centenario de Remeros and Club Arturo Prat.

==Transport==
===Roads and bridges===
[[File:Valdivian sea lions.JPG|thumb|right|[[Pedro de Valdivia Bridge]] and the city's [[South American sea lion|sea lion]] colony]]

Most of Valdivia lies on the southern side of the [[Valdivia River|Valdivia]] and [[Calle-Calle River]]s but other areas of the city, such as [[Isla Teja]] and [[Las Animas, Chile|Las Animas]], are connected to it by bridges. The main access points to the city are [[Calle-Calle Bridge]] from the north and a southern route. Both connect the city with the [[Pan-American Highway]] and run through forested areas and wetlands. [[Chile Route 207|Route 207]] runs from Valdivia southeast connecting the city with the town of [[Paillaco]] at the [[Chile Route 5|Route 5]].<ref name=burford2005>{{Cite book |title=Chile: The Bradt Travel Guide |last=Burford |first=Tim |year=2005 |isbn=9781841620763 |pages=475|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides }}</ref> 
 
Calle-Calle Bridge, the first bridge built in the city, connects Valdivia with Las Animas and forms the northern highway access to the city. [[Pedro de Valdivia Bridge]] was built in 1954 and connects the city with [[Isla Teja]], where many German immigrants once lived. During the Great [[1960 Valdivia earthquake]] only the minor [[Caucau Bridge]] (connecting Las Animas with Isla Teja) was destroyed,{{dubious|date=March 2022}} while all other bridges were repaired and are still in use. In 1987 [[Augusto Pinochet]] opened [[Río Cruces Bridge]], making the coastal town of [[Niebla, Chile|Niebla]] as well as [[Torobayo]] and [[Punucapa]] accessible by road. Calle-Calle Bridge, the main access to the city, was enlarged in the 1990s.

[[File:Puente Caucau, Valdivia, 20190216 - 12.jpg|thumb|The New Cau Cau bridge in Valdivia has been restored and fixed.]]

The new Caucau bridge was intended to provide a faster route from the city centre to the Pichoy airport via Isla Teja, but the faulty construction made it unusable.

===Waterways===
Until highway bridges were built, Valdivia's economy and citizens depended on boat traffic on the surrounding rivers, but with a contraction of bridges and highways, the river has lost its importance. Today, the rivers are used by the commercial ships built or repaired in [[Asenav]], one of Chile's most important shipyard companies, and by tourist boats. Some of the locations that are regularly reached by tourist boats include [[Mancera Island]] and [[Punucapa]].
Fishing boats also travel inland from the coast to the River Market. Today, just one ferry is still in operation, the [[Niebla, Chile|Niebla]]–[[Corral, Chile|Corral]] line, as it is much quicker to reach Corral by [[ferry]] than by road.
 
Although in recent years the rivers have not had a major role in Valdivia's public transportation, a new private project is being developed by "Los Solares",<ref>[http://www.solaresdevaldivia.cl/muelles-y-horarios/ Rutas de Los Solares Transportes TFS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425000822/http://www.solaresdevaldivia.cl/muelles-y-horarios/ |date=2014-04-25 }} Solaresdevaldivia.cl retrieved on February 17, 2014</ref> an environmentally friendly company that operates solar-powered river taxis on [[Valdivia River]]. The project is called Transporte Fluvial Sustentable (TFS, or "Sustainable Water Transportation" in English). So far, the company has a fleet of three river taxis,<ref>[http://www.elnaveghable.cl/etiquetas/valdivia-barrio-flotante Barrio Flotante en Valdivia ya está en marcha] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425000807/http://www.elnaveghable.cl/etiquetas/valdivia-barrio-flotante |date=2014-04-25 }} elnaveghable.cl January 27, 2013</ref> and a small, sustainable and locally designed floating village that includes a pier, a café and the company's offices. The community produces its own electricity, water supply and processes its own wastewater with a bacterial solution.<ref>[http://www.livingatlaschile.com/?s=River+neighbourhood Valdivia’s River neighbourhood Short documentary with English subtitles] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425002728/http://www.livingatlaschile.com/?s=River+neighbourhood |date=2014-04-25 }} www.livingatlaschile.com released on February 18, 2014 retrieved on February 23, 2014</ref>

===Airports===
The city is served mainly by [[Pichoy Airport]], lying 32&nbsp;km northeast of the city via the north entrance road that connects the city with the [[Pan American Highway]]. The smaller but much closer [[Las Marías Airport]] is used primarily by small aircraft, with no [[airline]]s operating there.
