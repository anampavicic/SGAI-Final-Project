It has a population of 1.6&nbsp;million, and it is the coldest capital city in the world by average yearly temperature.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-coldest-capital-cities-in-the-world.html|title=The Coldest Capital Cities In The World|last=Sen Nag|first=Oishimaya|publisher=WorldAtlas|date=2021-01-21|access-date=2022-12-12}}</ref> The municipality is located in north central Mongolia at an elevation of about {{convert|1300|m|ft}} in a valley on the [[Tuul River]]. The city was founded in 1639 as a nomadic [[Buddhist monasticism|Buddhist monastic]] centre, changing location 28 times, and was permanently settled at its modern location in 1778.

During its early years, as '''Örgöö''' (anglicized as '''Urga'''), it became [[Mongolia under Qing rule|Mongolia's]] preeminent religious centre and seat of the [[Jebtsundamba Khutuktu]], the spiritual head of the Gelug lineage of Tibetan [[Buddhism in Mongolia]]. Following the regulation of [[Kyakhta trade|Qing-Russian trade]] by the [[Treaty of Kyakhta (1727)|Treaty of Kyakhta in 1727]], a caravan route between [[Beijing]] and [[Kyakhta]] opened up, along which the city was eventually settled. With the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911, the city was a focal point for independence efforts, leading to the [[Mongolian Revolution of 1911|proclamation of the Bogd Khanate in 1911]] led by the [[Bogd Khan|8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, or Bogd Khan]], and again during the [[Mongolian Revolution of 1921|communist revolution of 1921]]. With the proclamation of the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] in 1924, the city was officially renamed Ulaanbaatar and declared the country's capital. Modern urban planning began in the 1950s, with most of the old [[ger district]]s replaced by [[Ugsarmal bair|Soviet-style flats]]. In 1990, Ulaanbaatar was the site of large demonstrations that led to [[Mongolian Revolution of 1990|Mongolia's transition to democracy and a market economy]]. Since 1990, an influx of migrants from the rest of the country has led to an explosive growth in its population, a major portion of whom live in ger districts, which has led to [[#Pollution|harmful air pollution]] in winter.

Governed as an [[Independent city|independent municipality]], Ulaanbaatar is surrounded by [[Töv Province]], whose capital [[Zuunmod]] lies {{convert|43|km|mi}} south of the city. With a population of just over 1.6&nbsp;million {{As of|December 2022|lc=y}}, it contains almost half of the country's total population.<ref name="Statis.ub.gov.mn">{{cite web |url=http://statis.ub.gov.mn/StatTable=11 |script-title=mn:Нийслэлийн статистикийн газар – Статистик үзүүлэлт – 01.

==Names and etymology==
{{see also|Names of Ulaanbaatar in different languages|}}

The city at its establishment in 1639 was referred to as {{lang|mn-Latn|Örgöö}} ({{lang-mn|{{MongolUnicode|ᠥᠷᠭᠦᠭᠡ|h}}; Өргөө|lit=Palace}}). This name was eventually adapted as {{lang|mn-Latn|Urga}}<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Urga |volume=27 |page=795}}</ref> in the West. By 1651, it began to be referred to as {{lang|mn-Latn|Nomiĭn Khüree}} ({{lang-mn|{{MongolUnicode|ᠨᠣᠮ {{zwj}}ᠤᠨ ᠬᠦᠷᠢᠶᠡᠨ|h}}; Номын хүрээ|lit=Khüree of Wisdom}}), and by 1706 it was referred to as {{lang|mn-Latn|Ikh Khüree}} ({{lang-mn|{{MongolUnicode|ᠶᠡᠬᠡ ᠬᠦᠷᠢᠶᠡᠨ|h}}; Их хүрээ|lit=Great Khüree}}). The Chinese equivalent, {{lang|zh-Latn|Dà Kùlún}} ({{lang-zh|大庫倫|lit=Great Kùlún}}, {{lang-mn|Да Хүрээ}}), was rendered into Western languages as ''Kulun'' or ''Kuren''.

Other names include {{lang|mn-Latn|[[Praise of Bogdiin Khuree|Bogdiin Khuree]]}} ({{lang-mn|{{MongolUnicode|ᠪᠣᠭᠳᠠ ᠶᠢᠨ ᠬᠦᠷᠢᠶᠡᠨ|h}}; Богдын хүрээ||lit=The [[Jebtsundamba Khutuktu|Bogd]]'s Khüree}}), or simply {{lang|mn-Latn|Khüree}} ({{lang-mn|{{MongolUnicode|ᠬᠦᠷᠢᠶᠡᠨ|h}}; Хүрээ|translit= Küriye}}), itself a term originally referring to an ''enclosure'' or ''settlement''.

Upon [[Mongolian Revolution of 1911|independence in 1911]], with both the secular government and the [[Bogd Khan]]'s palace present, the city's name was changed to {{lang|mn-Latn|Niĭslel Khüree}} ({{lang-mn|{{MongolUnicode|ᠨᠡᠶᠢᠰᠯᠡᠯ ᠬᠦᠷᠢᠶᠡᠨ|h}}; Нийслэл Хүрээ|lit=Capital Khüree}}).

When the city became the capital of the new [[Mongolian People's Republic]] on 29 October 1924, its name was changed to ''Ulaanbaatar'' ({{literal translation|Red Hero}}). At the meeting of the 1st Great People's Khural in 1924, the majority of delegates voted in favor of renaming the capital of Mongolia to Bator-khoto ("City of the Hero," or "City of the Hero," implicitly referring to the figure of Genghis Khan). Nevertheless, at the insistence of the Comintern representative, Soviet-Kazakhstan political figure [[Turar_Ryskulov|T. R. Ryskulov]], who previously had no connection to Mongolia, the city was named Ulan Bator Khoto ("City of the Red Hero") [14]. After the vote, he gave a speech:

Genghis Khan was a national hero, but he was a conqueror. Present-day People's Mongolia has no imperialistic goals; it wants to liberate itself and develop independently, along revolutionary lines. Therefore, the name Ulaanbaatar-Khoto will be a revolutionary name, and it will be understandable to everyone. The prefix Ulan ("red") gives this name a revolutionary character, symbolizing the revolutionary steadfastness of the Mongolian people in their struggle for independence.

In the Western world, Ulaanbaatar continued to be generally known as Urga or Khuree until 1924, and afterward as Ulan Bator (a spelling derived from the Russian {{lang|ru|Улан-Батор|translit=Ulan-Bator}}). This form was defined two decades before the Mongolian name got its current [[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] spelling and transliteration (1941–1950); however, the name of the city was spelled ''Ulaanbaatar koto'' during the decade [[Mongolian Latin alphabet|in which Mongolia used the Latin alphabet]].

==History==
{{main|History of Ulaanbaatar}}

===Prehistory===
Human habitation at the site of Ulaanbaatar dates from the [[Lower Paleolithic]], with a number of sites on the [[Bogd Khan Mountain|Bogd Khan]], Buyant-Ukhaa and Songinokhairkhan mountains, revealing tools which date from 300,000 years ago to 40,000–12,000 years ago. These [[Upper Paleolithic]] people hunted [[mammoth]] and [[woolly rhinoceros]], the bones of which are found abundantly around Ulaanbaatar.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Before 1639===
[[File:WangKhanRuins.jpg|left|thumb|Roof tiles recovered from [[Wang Khan]]'s 12th-century palace in Ulaanbaatar]]
A number of [[Xiongnu]]-era royal tombs have been discovered around Ulaanbaatar, including the tombs of Belkh Gorge near Dambadarjaalin monastery and tombs of Songinokhairkhan. Located on the banks of the [[Tuul River]], Ulaanbaatar has been well within the sphere of Turco-Mongol [[nomadic empires]] throughout history.

[[Wang Khan]], Toghrul of the [[Keraites]], a [[Church of the East|Nestorian Christian]] monarch whom [[Marco Polo]] identified as the legendary [[Prester John]], is said to have had his palace here (the Black Forest of the Tuul River) and forbade hunting in the holy mountain Bogd Uul. The palace is said to be where [[Genghis Khan]] stayed with Yesui Khatun before attacking the [[Tangut people|Tangut]] in 1226.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

During the [[Mongol Empire]] (1206–1368) and [[Northern Yuan|Northern Yuan dynasty]] (1368–1635) the main, natural route from the capital region of [[Karakorum]] to the birthplace and tomb of the Khans in the Khentii mountain region ([[Ikh Khorig]]) passed through the area of Ulaanbaatar. The Tuul River naturally leads to the north-side of Bogd Khan Mountain, which stands out as a large island of forest positioned conspicuously at the south-western edge of the Khentii mountains. As the main gate and stopover point on the route to and from the holy Khentii mountains, the Bogd Khan Mountain saw large amounts of traffic going past it and was protected from early times. Even after the Northern Yuan period it served as the location of the annual and triannual Assembly of Nobles (''Khan Uuliin Chuulgan'').

===Mobile monastery===
Founded in 1639 as a [[yurt]] monastery as Örgöö ({{Lit|palace-[[yurt]]}}), the settlement was first located at Lake Shireet Tsagaan nuur ({{convert|75|km|abbr=off}} directly east of the imperial capital Karakorum) in what is now [[Bürd, Övörkhangai|Burd sum]], [[Övörkhangai Province|Övörkhangai]], around {{convert|230|km|0|abbr=off}} south-west from the present site of Ulaanbaatar, and was intended by the Mongol nobles to be the seat of [[Zanabazar]], the first [[Jebtsundamba Khutughtu]]. Zanabazar returned to Mongolia from Tibet in 1651, and founded seven ''aimags'' (monastic departments) in Urga, later establishing four more.<ref>{{cite book |script-title=mn:Улаанбаатар хотын хөгжлийн түүхэн замнал, хэтийн төлөв |language=mn |date=1974 |publisher=УХГ |location=УБ}}</ref>

As a mobile monastery-town, Örgöö was often moved to various places along the [[Selenga River|Selenge]], [[Orkhon River|Orkhon]] and Tuul rivers, as supply and other needs would demand. During the [[Dzungar Khanate|Dzungar]] wars of the late 17th century, it was even moved to [[Inner Mongolia]].<ref>''Улаанбаатар'', Ulaanbaatar 2001, pg. 9f</ref> As the city grew, it moved less and less.<ref name="BH of UB">{{cite web |url=http://www.ulaanbaatar.mn/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=165&Itemid=821 |title=Brief history of Ulaanbaatar |publisher=Ulaanbaatar.mn |access-date=24 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203042346/http://www.ulaanbaatar.mn/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=165&Itemid=821 |archive-date=3 December 2013}}</ref>

The movements of the city can be detailed as follows: Shireet Tsagaan Nuur (1639), Khoshoo Tsaidam (1640), Khentii Mountains (1654), Ogoomor (1688), Inner Mongolia (1690), Tsetserlegiin Erdene Tolgoi (1700), Daagandel (1719), Usan Seer (1720), Ikh Tamir (1722), Jargalant (1723), Eeven Gol (1724), Khujirtbulan (1729), Burgaltai (1730), Sognogor (1732), Terelj (1733), Uliastai River (1734), Khui Mandal (1736), Khuntsal (1740), Udleg (1742), Ogoomor (1743), Selbe (1747), Uliastai River (1756), Selbe (1762), Khui Mandal (1772) and Selbe (1778).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In 1778, the city moved from Khui Mandal and settled for good at its current location, near the confluence of the Selbe and Tuul rivers, and beneath [[Bogd Khan Uul]], at that time also on the caravan route from [[Beijing]] to [[Kyakhta]].<ref>Kohn, Michael ''[[Lonely Planet]] Mongolia'' (4th edition, 2005); {{ISBN|1-74059-359-6}}, p. 52.</ref>

One of the earliest Western mentions of Urga is the account of the Scottish traveller [[John Bell (traveller)|John Bell]] in 1721:
{{blockquote|What they call the Urga is the court, or the place where the prince (Tusheet Khan) and high priest (Bogd Jebtsundamba Khutugtu) reside, who are always encamped at no great distance from one another. They have several thousand tents about them, which are removed from time to time. The Urga is much frequented by merchants from China and Russia, and other places.<ref>John Bell, ''Travels from St. Petersburgh in Russia, to various parts of Asia'' (Volume 1), 1763, London, p. 344</ref>}}

By Zanabazar's death in 1723, Urga was Mongolia's preeminent monastery in terms of religious authority. A council of seven of the highest-ranking [[lama]]s (''Khamba Nomon Khan'', ''Ded Khamba'' and five ''Tsorj'') made most of the city's religious decisions. It had also become Outer Mongolia's commercial center. From 1733 to 1778, Urga moved around the vicinity of its present location. In 1754, the Erdene Shanzodba Yam {{note|Administration of Ecclesiastical Estate}} of Urga was given authority to supervise the administrative affairs of the Bogd's subjects. It also served as the city's chief judicial court. In 1758, the Qianlong Emperor appointed the [[Khalkha Mongols|Khalkha]] Vice General Sanzaidorj as the first Mongol [[amban]] of Urga, with full authority to "oversee the Khuree and administer well all the [[Khutugtu]]'s subjects".<ref>Majer, Zsuzsa & Krisztina Teleki, [http://www.mongoliantemples.net/images/pdfs/OLDUBWEB%202008.pdf "Monasteries and Temples of Bogdiin Khuree, Ikh Khuree or Urga, the Old Capital City of Mongolia in the First Part of the Twentieth Century"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227184244/http://www.mongoliantemples.net/images/pdfs/OLDUBWEB%202008.pdf|date=27 February 2009}}</ref>

In 1761, a second amban was appointed for the same purpose, a [[Manchu people|Manchu]] one. A quarter-century later, in 1786, a decree issued in Peking gave right to the Urga ambans to decide the administrative affairs of [[Tüsheet Khan|Tusheet Khan]] and Setsen Khan territories. With this, Urga became the highest civil authority in the country. Based on Urga's Mongol governor Sanzaidorj's petition, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] officially recognized an annual ceremony on Bogd Khan Mountain in 1778 and provided the annual imperial donations. The city was the seat of the [[Jebtsundamba]] Khutugtus, two [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] ambans, and a [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] trade town grew "four trees" {{convert|4.24|km|2|abbr=on}} east of the city center at the confluence of the Uliastai and Tuul rivers.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

[[File:OldPaintingUrga.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Detail of 19th-century painting of Urga (Ulaanbaatar): in the center the movable square temple of Bat Tsagaan, built in 1654, besides numerous other temples]]
By 1778, Urga may have had as many as ten thousand monks, who were regulated by a monastic rule, Internal Rule of the Grand Monastery or ''Yeke Kuriyen-u Doto'adu Durem''. For example, in 1797 a decree of the 4th Jebtsundamba forbade "singing, playing with archery, myagman, chess, usury and smoking"). Executions were forbidden where the holy temples of the Bogd Jebtsundama could be seen, so capital punishment took place away from the city.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In 1839, the 5th Bogd Jebtsundamba moved his residence to Gandan Hill, an elevated position to the west of the Baruun Damnuurchin markets. Part of the city was moved to nearby Tolgoit. In 1855, the part of the camp that moved to Tolgoit was brought back to its 1778 location, and the 7th Bogd Jebtsundamba returned to the Zuun Khuree. The [[Gandantegchinlen Monastery|Gandan Monastery]] flourished as a center of philosophical studies.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}
[[File:Consulate of the Russian Empire in Urgoo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The Russian Consulate of Urga (Ulaanbaatar) and the Holy Trinity Church, both built in 1863]]

===Urga and the Kyakhta trade===
Following the [[Treaty of Kyakhta]] in 1727, Urga (Ulaanbaatar) was a major point of the [[Kyakhta trade]] between Russia and China – mostly Siberian furs for Chinese cloth and later tea. The route ran south to Urga, southeast across the [[Gobi Desert]] to [[Kalgan]], and southeast over the mountains to Peking. Urga was also a collection point for goods coming from further west. These were either sent to China or shipped north to Russia via Kyakhta, because of legal restrictions and the lack of good trade routes to the west.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

By 1908,<ref>Lindon Wallace Bates, ''The Russian Road to China'', 1910</ref> there was a Russian quarter with a few hundred merchants and a Russian club and informal Russian mayor. East of the main town was the Russian consulate, built in 1863, with an [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] church, a post office and 20 [[Cossacks|Cossack]] guards. It was fortified in 1900 and briefly occupied by troops during the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. There was a telegraph line north to Kyakhta and southeast to Kalgan and weekly postal service along these routes.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Beyond the Russian consulate was the Chinese trading post called [[Bayanzürkh|Maimaicheng]], and nearby the palace of the Manchu viceroy. With the growth of Western trade at the Chinese ports, the tea trade to Russia declined, some Chinese merchants left, and wool became the main export. Manufactured goods still came from Russia, but most were now brought from Kalgan by caravan. The annual trade was estimated at 25 million rubles, nine-tenths in Chinese hands and one-tenth in Russian.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The Moscow trade expedition of the 1910s estimated the population of Urga at 60,000, based on [[Nikolay Przhevalsky]]'s study in the 1870s.<ref name="archives.gov.mn">[https://www.archives.gov.mn/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=424:-100-&catid=3:newsflash&Itemid=118 "From Khutagtiin Khuree to Niislel Khuree"]. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010143305/http://www.archives.gov.mn/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=424:-100-&catid=3:newsflash&Itemid=118 |date=2017-10-10 }}.

The city's population swelled during the [[Naadam]] festival and major religious festivals to more than 100,000. In 1919, the number of monks had reached 20,000, up from 13,000 in 1810.<ref name="archives.gov.mn"/>

=== Independence and Niislel Khüree ===
[[File:Proclamation of Niislel Khuree.jpg|thumb|''[[Jarlig]]'' proclaiming Ikh Khüree as Niislel (Capital) Khüree, 1912.]]

In 1910, the ''amban'' [[Sando (official)|Sando]] went to quell a major fight between [[Gandantegchinlen Monastery|Gandan lamas]] and Chinese traders started by an incident at the Da Yi Yu shop in the Baruun Damnuurchin market district. He was unable to bring the lamas under control, and was forced to flee back to his quarters. In 1911, with the [[Qing dynasty]] in China headed for total collapse, Mongolian leaders in Ikh Khüree for [[Naadam]] met in secret on Mount Bogd Khan Uul and resolved to end 220 years of [[Manchu]] control of their country.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

On 29 December 1911, the [[Bogd Khan|8th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu]] was declared ruler of an [[Outer Mongolia (1911–1919)|independent Mongolia]] and assumed the title Bogd Khan.<ref name="BH of UB"/> Khüree as the seat of the Jebtsundamba Khutugtu was the logical choice for the capital of the new state. However, following the [[Treaty of Kyakhta (1915)|tripartite Kyakhta agreement of 1915]], Mongolia's status was effectively reduced to mere autonomy.

In 1919, Mongolian nobles, over the opposition of the Bogd Khan, agreed with the Chinese resident Chen Yi on a settlement of the "Mongolian question" along Qing-era lines, but before this settlement could be put into effect, Khüree was occupied by the troops of Chinese warlord [[Xu Shuzheng]], who forced the Mongolian nobles and clergy to renounce autonomy completely.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The city changed hands twice in 1921. First, on 4 February, a mixed Russian/Mongolian force led by [[White Movement|White Russian]] warlord [[Roman von Ungern-Sternberg]] captured the city, freeing the [[Bogd Khan]] from Chinese imprisonment and killing a part of the Chinese garrison. Baron Ungern's capture of Urga was followed by the clearing out of Mongolia's small gangs of demoralized Chinese soldiers and, at the same time, looting and murder of foreigners, including a vicious pogrom that [[History of the Jews in Mongolia|killed off the Jewish community]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Othen |first=Christopher |title=Urga, February 1921 |url=http://brightreview.co.uk |access-date=2020-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191121182818/http://www.brightreview.co.uk/ |archive-date=2019-11-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Palmer |first=James |title=The Bloody White Baron |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780465014484 |url-access=registration |year=2009|publisher=Perseus Books |isbn=9780465014484 }}</ref><ref name=By>{{cite book |last=Bisher |first=Jamie |title=White Terror: Cossack Warlords Of The Trans-Siberian |page=276}}</ref>

On 22 February 1921, the Bogd Khan was once again elevated to Great Khan of Mongolia in Urga.<ref>Kuzmin, S. L. ''History of Baron Ungern: an Experience of Reconstruction''. Moscow: KMK, 2011, pp. 165–200</ref> However, at the same time that Baron Ungern was taking control of Urga, a Soviet-supported Communist Mongolian force led by [[Damdin Sükhbaatar]] was forming in Russia, and in March they crossed the border. Ungern and his men rode out in May to meet Red Russian and Red Mongolian troops, but suffered a disastrous defeat in June.<ref>Kuzmin, pp. 250–300</ref>

In July 1921, the Communist Soviet-Mongolian army became the second conquering force in six months to enter Urga, and Mongolia came under the control of Soviet Russia. On 29 October 1924, the town was renamed ''Ulaanbaatar''. On the session of the 1st Great People's Khuraldaan of Mongolia in 1924, a majority of delegates had expressed their wish to change the capital city's name to ''[[Baghatur|Baatar]] Khot'' ({{Lit|Hero City}}). However, under pressure from [[Turar Ryskulov]], a Kazakh Soviet activist of the [[Comintern|Communist International]], the city was named ''Ulaanbaatar Khot'' ({{Lit|Red-Hero City}}).<ref>Протоколы 1-го Великого Хуралдана Монгольской Народной Республики.

===Socialist era===
[[File:Yavuuhulan Garden.jpg|thumb|Green areas were increased in the city center during the communist era]]
[[File:Dzah.jpg|thumb|Outdoor market near Gandan Hill in 1972; [[State Department Store]] in the background]]

During the [[Socialist Mongolia|socialist period]], especially following the [[Second World War]], most of the old [[ger district]]s were replaced by [[Ugsarmal bair|Soviet-style blocks of flats]], often financed by the Soviet Union. [[Urban planning]] began in the 1950s, and much of the city core today is a result of construction between 1960 and 1985.<ref>Montsame News Agency. ''Mongolia''. 2006; {{ISBN|99929-0-627-8}}, pp. 33–34.</ref>

The [[Trans-Mongolian Railway]], connecting Ulaanbaatar with Moscow and Beijing, was completed in 1956, and cinemas, theaters, museums and other modern facilities were erected. Most of the temples and monasteries of pre-socialist Khüree were destroyed following the anti-religious [[Stalinist purges in Mongolia|purges]] of the late 1930s. The Gandan monastery was reopened in 1944 when the [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. Vice President]] [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]] asked to see a monastery during his visit to Mongolia.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Contemporary era===
Ulaanbaatar and chiefly [[Sükhbaatar Square]] was a major site of demonstrations that led to Mongolia's [[Mongolian Revolution of 1990|transition to democracy and market economy in 1990]]. Starting on 10 December 1989, protesters outside the Youth Culture Center called for Mongolia to implement [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]] in their full sense. After months of large-scale demonstrations and hunger strikes, the governing [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] resigned on 9 March 1990. The provisional government announced Mongolia's [[1990 Mongolian parliamentary election|first free elections]], which were held in July 1990, paving the way for the [[Constitution of Mongolia|new constitution of 1992]] and the dissolution of the [[Mongolian People's Republic]].

Since Mongolia's transition to a market economy in 1990, the city has experienced rapid growth. From a population of 535,000 in 1990, it had grown to 1 million inhabitants by 2007, and 1.5 million by 2021,<ref>{{Cite web |last= |script-title=mn:02.

Much of this rapid population rise is attributed to migration from rural areas, as herder families abandon their traditional lifestyles in search of opportunities in the city.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-06-04 |title=The Urbanization of Ulaanbaatar |url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145125/the-urbanization-of-ulaanbaatar |access-date=2024-06-25 |website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov |language=en}}</ref> Much of these new arrivals settle in [[ger district]]s without plumbing, sanitation, central heating, and basic services.

Ulaanbaatar was [[2008 riot in Mongolia|the scene of riots in 2008]] after supporters of the opposition parties disputed the ruling [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]]'s claim of victory after the [[Mongolian legislative election, 2008|parliamentary elections]]. A four-day state of emergency was declared, the capital was placed under a curfew, and alcohol sales banned with no further riots taking place.<ref name="BBC2">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7484632.stm |title=Fatal clashes in Mongolia capital |work=BBC News |date=2 July 2008 |access-date=26 September 2018}}</ref><ref name="BBC3">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7486794.stm |title=Streets calm in riot-hit Mongolia |work=BBC News |date=3 July 2008 |access-date=26 September 2018}}</ref> This was the first deadly riot in modern Ulaanbaatar's history.

In April 2013, Ulaanbaatar hosted the 7th Ministerial Conference of the [[Community of Democracies]], and has also lent its name to the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security.

[[Chinggis Khaan International Airport]] in Ulaanbataar was opened to the public on 4 July 2021.

Since the 2010s Ulaanbaatar has seen a construction boom filling the city with high-rise offices and apartment blocks.<ref name=":4" />

==Geography==
[[File:Ulan Bator, Mongolia, Sentinel-2 satellite image, 09-JUL-2017.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Ulaanbaatar, showing the city core along the Tuul River Valley with Bogd Khan Mountain dominating the south. The city's ger districts sprawl into the mountainous areas in the north.]]

Ulaanbaatar is located at about {{convert|1350|m}} above mean [[sea level]], slightly east of the center of Mongolia, on the [[Tuul River]], a sub-[[tributary]] of the [[Selenga|Selenge]], in a valley at the foot of the mountain [[Bogd Khan Uul]]. Bogd Khan Uul is a broad, heavily forested mountain rising {{convert|2250|m}} to the south of Ulaanbaatar. It forms the boundary between the [[steppe]] zone to the south and the forest-steppe zone to the north. Traditionally, Ulaanbaatar is said to be surrounded by four peaks, clockwise from west: Songino Khairkhan, Chingeltei, Bayanzurkh, and finally Bogd Khan Uul.

The forests of the mountains surrounding Ulaanbaatar are composed of evergreen pines, [[deciduous]] larches and [[birch]]es, while the riverine forest of the Tuul River is composed of broad-leaved, deciduous [[Populus|poplar]]s, [[elm]]s and [[willow]]s. Ulaanbaatar lies at roughly the same latitude as [[Vienna]], [[Munich]], [[Orléans]] and [[Seattle]]. It lies at roughly the same longitude as [[Chongqing]], [[Hanoi]] and [[Jakarta]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

=== Climate ===
Owing to its high elevation, its relatively high latitude, its location hundreds of kilometres from any coast, and the effects of the [[Siberian anticyclone]], Ulaanbaatar is the coldest national capital in the world,<ref name="Montsame News Agency 2006, pg. 35">Montsame News Agency. ''Mongolia''. 2006, {{ISBN|99929-0-627-8}}, p. 35</ref> with a [[monsoon]]-influenced, cold [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''[[Cold semi-arid climate|BSk]]'', USDA [[Hardiness zone|Plant Hardiness Zone]] 3b<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantsdb.gr/en/general-cultivation/hardiness-zones/274-hardiness-zones-map|title=Hardiness Zones – WORLD MAP|publisher=Plantsdb.gr|date=15 August 1965|access-date=25 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416182710/http://www.plantsdb.gr/en/general-cultivation/hardiness-zones/274-hardiness-zones-map|archive-date=16 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>). Aside from precipitation and from a thermal standpoint, the city is on the boundary between [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] (''Dwb'') and [[subarctic climate|subarctic]] (''Dwc''). This is due to its {{convert|10|C|F}} mean temperature for the month of May.

The city features brief, warm summers and long, bitterly cold and dry winters. The coldest January temperatures, usually at the time just before sunrise, are between {{convert|-36|and|-40|°C|°F|1}} with no wind, because of [[temperature inversion]]. Most of the annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] of {{convert|267|mm|2}} falls from May to September. The highest recorded annual precipitation in the city was {{convert|659|mm|2|disp=or}} at the Khureltogoot Astronomical Observatory on Mount Bogd Khan Uul. Ulaanbaatar has an average annual temperature of {{convert|0.2|°C|1|disp=or}},<ref name="HKO">{{cite web|url=http://www.hko.gov.hk/wxinfo/climat/world/eng/asia/china/ulaanbaatar_e.htm|publisher=[[Hong Kong Observatory]]|access-date=14 April 2010|title=Climatological Normals of Ulan Bator|archive-date=23 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191023104134/http://www.hko.gov.hk/wxinfo/climat/world/eng/asia/china/ulaanbaatar_e.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> making it the coldest capital in the world (almost as cold as [[Nuuk]], [[Greenland]], but Greenland is not independent). Nuuk has a tundra climate with consistent cold temperatures throughout the year. Ulaanbaatar's annual average is brought down by its cold winter temperatures even though it is significantly warm from late April to early October.

The city lies in the zone of [[discontinuous permafrost]], which means that building is difficult in sheltered locations that preclude thawing in the summer, but easier on more exposed ones where soils fully thaw. Suburban residents live in traditional [[yurt]]s that do not protrude into the soil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/od/physicalgeography/a/coldcapital.htm|title=Coldest Capital Cities|author=Matt Rosenberg|work=About.com Education|access-date=2006-11-11|archive-date=2011-12-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228065444/http://geography.about.com/od/physicalgeography/a/coldcapital.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> Extreme temperatures in the city range from {{convert|-43.9|°C|°F}} in January 1957 to {{convert|39.0|°C|°F}} in July 1988.<ref name="pogoda" />

=== Cityscape ===
[[File:Ulaanbaatar new buildings in Yaarmag.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|New high-rise constructions in Yaarmag area]]
The city's inner core consists of a central district built in 1940s- and 1950s-style Soviet architecture, surrounded by and mingled with residential [[Ugsarmal bair|concrete towerblocks]] and large [[ger district]]s. Starting after the fall of communism, many of the towerblocks' ground floors were modified and upgraded to small shops, and many new buildings have been erected—some illegally, as some private companies erect buildings without legal licenses/permits. Since the 2010s, a construction boom has been ongoing, leading to many high-rise apartment and office blocks in the inner core as well as new settlement areas.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web |date=2023-05-10 |title=Mongolia's building boom traps capital residents in concrete jungle |url=https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20230510-mongolia-s-building-boom-traps-capital-residents-in-concrete-jungle |access-date=2023-11-12 |website=France 24 |language=en}}</ref>

Ulaanbaatar presently has multiple cinemas, one modern ski resort, two large indoor stadiums, several large department stores and one large amusement park. Food, entertainment and recreation venues are steadily increasing in variety. International food chains such as [[KFC]], [[Burger King]], [[Pizza Hut]], [[Round Table Pizza]], [[Cinnabon]], and hotel chains such as [[Ramada]], [[Kempinski]], and [[Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts|Shangri-La]] have opened branches in the city.

=== Parks ===
[[File:Gorkhi-Terelj National Park.jpg|thumb|[[Gorkhi-Terelj National Park]] is a popular picnic and camping ground all year round]]

A number of national parks and protected areas officially belong to the city. [[Gorkhi-Terelj National Park]], a nature preserve with many tourist facilities, is approximately {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=on}} from Ulaanbaatar. The {{convert|40|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off|-high}} [[Genghis Khan Equestrian Statue]] is {{convert|54|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. It is also close to [[Hustai National Park]], home to reintroduced [[Przewalski's horse|Takhi]] wild horses, {{convert|90|km|abbr=off}} west of the city.

[[Bogd Khan Mountain|Bogd Khan Uul]], which dominates the south, is a strictly [[protected area]] with a length of {{convert|31|km|mi|abbr=off}} and width of {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=off}}, covering an area of {{convert|67,300|ha|0|abbr=off}}. Nature conservation dates back to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries when the [[Toghrul|Tooril Khan]] of the Mongolian Ancient [[Keraites|Keraite]] Aimag – who prohibited logging and hunting activities – claimed the Bogd Khan as a holy mountain.<ref>{{cite web |title=Biosphere Reserve Information: BOGD KHAN UUL |url=http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=MON+02&mode=all |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160218003706/http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=MON+02&mode=all |archive-date=2016-02-18 |access-date=2015-12-11}}</ref> The ruins of [[Manjusri Monastery]] are located on the southern flank of Bogd Khan Uul and is a popular destination for outings.

The [[National Amusement Park]] is an amusement park located in the downtown section, south of Shangri-La Hotel.{{cn|reason=Google Maps is too volatile to be a reliable source and is impossible to archive|date=October 2024}} It is also a popular place for young people to hang out. This small amusement park features rides, games and paddle boats. Its original [[Artificial Lake Castle]] was built in 1969.

The [[National Garden Park]] ({{lang-mn|Үндэсний Цэцэрлэгт Хүрээлэн|translit=Ündesnii tsetserlegt khüreelen}}), in the southeastern outskirts of the city,{{cn|reason=Google Maps is too volatile to be a reliable source and is impossible to archive|date=October 2024}} opened in 2009 and has become a popular summer destination for residents. It has a total area of 55 hectares, with over 100,000 trees planted. The park is geared towards becoming an educational center for healthy, responsible living as well as environmental education.

64.6% of the population was reported to have been born in Ulaanbaatar. The [[Foreign born|foreign-born]] population was recorded as 17,456 in 2020.<ref name="2020-census" />

=== Religion ===
Ulaanbaatar has a long tradition of [[Buddhism]], having been initially founded and settled as a monastic center. Prominent places of worship in the city include the [[Gandantegchinlen Monastery]] and [[Choijin Lama Temple]]. In modern times, it has become a multifaith center, having added multiple [[Christianity|Christian]] churches (such as the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Holy Trinity Church, Ulaanbaatar|Holy Trinity Church]], as well as the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral (Ulaanbaatar)|Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral]]) and Islamic mosques.

According to the 2020 national census, 46.3% of the population over 15 years of age identified as being [[irreligious]], while 53.7% identified as being religious, a decrease of 7.7 percentage points in [[religiosity]] since the 2010 census.<ref name="2020-census" />

Of the people identifying as religious, responses included [[Buddhism in Mongolia|Buddhism]] (89.1%), [[Mongolian shamanism|Shamanism]] (5.4%), [[Christianity in Mongolia|Christianity]] (3.3%), and [[Islam in Mongolia|Islam]] (0.9%).<ref name="2020-census" />

==Governance==
[[File:Ulaanbaatar Zakhirgaa 2023.jpg|thumb|Newly built city government headquarters in Yaarmag area, [[Khan Uul]]]]
Ulaanbaatar is treated as an independent first-level region, separate from the surrounding [[Töv Province|Töv Aimag]]. It is governed by the [[Citizens' Representatives Khural of the Capital City|Ulaanbaatar City Council]] with 45 members, elected every four years.<ref>{{Cite web |script-title=mn:Түүхэн товчоо |language=mn |url=https://khural.ulaanbaatar.mn/introduction/history |access-date=2023-11-12 |website=khural.ulaanbaatar.mn |title=Title }}</ref> The [[Prime Minister of Mongolia]] appoints the [[Mayor of Ulaanbaatar|Governor of the Capital City and Mayor of Ulaanbaatar]] with four-year terms upon the city council's nomination.<ref>{{Cite web |last=O |first=Erdenechimeg |script-title=mn:Улаанбаатар хотын 35 дахь дарга өнөөдөр томилогдоно |url=http://eagle.mn/r/119555 |access-date=2023-11-12 |website=eagle.mn |language=en}}</ref>

=== Districts ===
{{main|Districts of Ulaanbaatar}}
[[File:Ulan Bator subdivisions.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Map of the districts of Ulaanbaatar]]

The city is divided into nine districts ({{Lang-mn|дүүрэг|translit=Düüreg}}): [[Baganuur]], [[Bagakhangai]], [[Bayangol, Ulaanbaatar|Bayangol]], [[Bayanzürkh]], [[Chingeltei]], [[Khan Uul]], [[Nalaikh]], [[Songino Khairkhan]] and [[Sükhbaatar (district)|Sükhbaatar]]. Each district is subdivided into [[khoroo]]s, of which there are 204.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.montsame.mn/mn/read/285216 |script-title=mn:Нийслэл хот 204 хороотой боллоо |trans-title=The capital city has 204 khoroos |website=Montsame Mongolian National News Agency |lang=mn |date=2021-12-27 |access-date=2024-06-04}}</ref> Each district also serves as a constituency that elects one or more representatives into the [[State Great Khural]], the national parliament.

Although administratively part of Ulaanbaatar, Nalaikh and Baganuur are separate cities. Bagakhangai and Baganuur are noncontiguous exclaves, the former located within the [[Töv Province]], the latter on the border between Töv and [[Khentii Province|Khentii]] provinces.

=== Municipal symbols ===
The official emblem of Ulaanbaatar is the {{IAST|[[garuḍa]]}}, a mythical bird in both [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] scriptures, referred to as the ''Khangar'd'' ({{lang-mn|Хангарьд}}, {{Lit|[[Khan (title)|Khan]] Garuda}}) by Mongols.

The ''garuḍa'' appears on Ulaanbaatar's [[emblem]]. In its right hand is a key, a symbol of prosperity and openness, and in its left is a [[Nelumbo|lotus]] flower, a symbol of peace, equality and purity. In its talons it is holding a snake, a symbol of evil of which it is intolerant. On the {{IAST|garuḍa}}'s forehead is the [[soyombo symbol]], which is featured on the [[flag of Mongolia]]. The city's flag is sky blue representing the [[Tngri|eternal sky]] and has the {{IAST|garuḍa}} in the center.<ref>{{Cite web |script-title=mn:Хотын тухай |url=https://www.ulaanbaatar.mn/about/ |access-date=2023-11-12 |website=ulaanbaatar.mn |language=mn |title=Ulaanbaatar.mn }}</ref>

==Economy==
{{See also|Category:Companies based in Ulaanbaatar}}

The largest corporations and conglomerates of Mongolia are almost all headquartered in Ulaanbaatar. In 2017 Ulaanbaatar had five billionaires and 90 multimillionaires with net worth above 10 million dollars.<ref>{{cite web |title=Foreigners have determined the 10 richest people in Mongolia |url=https://www.caak.mn/view/8272848/ |website=Caak.mn |access-date=16 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The list of 100 richest Mongolians is causing a stir on a Russian website |url=https://www.ugluu.mn/228275.html |website=Ugluu.mn |date=3 October 2016 |access-date=3 October 2016}}</ref> Major Mongolian companies include MCS Group, Gatsuurt LLC, Genco, MAK, Altai Trading, Tavan Bogd Group, [[Mobicom Corporation]], Bodi, Shunkhlai, Monnis and Petrovis. While not on the level of multinational corporations, most of these companies are multi-sector conglomerates with far-reaching influence in the country.

Ulaanbaatar (Urga) has been a key location where the economic history and wealth creation of the nation has played out. Unlike the highly mobile dwellings of herders nomadizing between winter and summer pastures, Urga was set up to be a semi-permanent residence of the high lama [[Zanabazar]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2021}} It stood in one location (Khoshoo Tsaidam) from 1640 to 1654, an unusually long period of 15 years, before Zanabazar moved it east to the foot of Mount Saridag in the [[Khentii Mountains]]. Here he set about building a permanent monastery town with stone buildings. Urga stayed at Mount Saridag for a full 35 years and was indeed assumed to be permanent there when [[Oirats]] suddenly invaded the region in 1688 and burnt down the city. With a major part of his life's work destroyed, Zanabazar had to take the mobile portion of Urga and flee to [[Inner Mongolia]].{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

More than half the wealth created in Urga in the period from 1639 to 1688 is thought to have been lost in 1688. Only in 1701 did Urga return to the region and start a second period of expansion, but it had to remain mobile until the end of the 70-year-long [[Dzungar-Qing Wars]] in 1757. After settling down in its current location in 1778, Urga saw sustained economic growth, but most of the wealth went to the Buddhist clergy, nobles as well as the temporary [[Shanxi merchants]] based in the eastern and western China-towns of Urga. There were numerous companies called ''puus'' ({{lang|mn|пүүс}}) and temple treasuries called ''jas'' ({{lang|mn|жас}}), which functioned as businesses, but none of these survived the Communist period. During the [[Mongolian People's Republic]], private property was only marginally tolerated, while most assets were state-owned. The oldest companies still operating in Ulaanbaatar date to the early MPR. Only the [[Gandantegchinlen Monastery]] has been operating non-stop for 205 years (with a 6-year gap during World War II), but whether it can be seen as a business is still debated.

As the main industrial center of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar produces a variety of consumer goods <ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/places/asia/chinese-political-geography/ulaanbaatar |title=Ulaanbaatar |via=encyclopedia.com |encyclopedia=The Columbia Encyclopedia |edition=6th |access-date=13 November 2016}}</ref> and is responsible for about two-thirds of Mongolia's total [[gross domestic product]] (GDP).<ref name=":0">[https://asiafoundation.org/resources/pdfs/economicdevelopmentmongolia.pdf "Economic Development in Mongolia"].{{dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} The Asia Foundation. Accessed 13 November 2016.</ref>

The transition to a market economy in 1990 has so far correlated with an increase in GDP, leading to a shift towards service industries (which now make up 43% of the city's GDP) along with rapid urbanization and population growth.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal |last1=Fan |first1=Peilei |last2=Chen |first2=Jiquan |last3=John |first3=Ranjeet |date=2016-01-01 |title=Urbanization and environmental change during the economic transition on the Mongolian Plateau: Hohhot and Ulaanbaatar |journal=Environmental Research |series=The Provision of Ecosystem Services in Response to Global Change |volume=144 |issue=Pt B |pages=96–112 |doi=10.1016/j.envres.2015.09.020|pmid=26456409 |bibcode=2016ER....144...96F |doi-access=free }}</ref>

Mining is the second-largest contributor to Ulaanbaatar's GDP, at 25%. North of the city are several gold mines, including the [[Boroo Gold Mine]], and foreign investment in the sector has allowed for growth and development. However, in light of a noticeable drop in GDP during the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|financial crisis of 2008]], as demand for mining exports dropped,<ref name=":1"/> there has been movement towards diversifying the economy.<ref name=":0"/>

== Culture ==

===Arts===
{{Further|Mongolian People's Central Theatre}}
[[File:National Dance.jpg|thumb|Mongolian National Song and Dance Academic Ensemble]]
Ulaanbaatar features a mix of traditional and western-style theatres, offering world-class performances. Many of the traditional folklore bands play regularly around the world, including in New York, London and Tokyo. The [[Mongolian State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Ulaanbaatar Opera House]], situated in the center of the city, hosts concerts and musical performances as well as opera and ballet performances, some in collaboration with world ballet houses such as the Boston Theatre.

The Mongolian State Grand National Orchestra was established in 1945. It has the largest orchestra of traditional instruments in the country, with a repertoire going beyond [[Music of Mongolia|national music]], encompassing dozens of international musical pieces.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Website |url=http://mongolian-ensemble.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222100411/http://mongolian-ensemble.com/ |archive-date=22 December 2015}}</ref>

The Tumen Ekh Ensemble comprises artists who perform all types of Mongolian song, music and dance. They play traditional instruments, including the [[morin khuur]] (horsehead fiddle), and perform Mongolian [[long song]], epic and eulogy songs, a [[Shamanism|shaman]] ritual dance, an ancient palace dance and a Tsam mask dance.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Website |url=https://tumenekh.wordpress.com}}</ref>

The Morin Khuur Ensemble of Mongolia is part of the [[Mongolian Symphony Orchestra|Mongolian State Philharmonic]], based at Sükhbaatar Square. It is a popular ensemble featuring the national string instrument, the morin khuur, and performs various domestic and international works.

===Monasteries===
[[File:1913 in Khuree.jpg|thumb|1913 color photo of Gandan Monastery]]
Among the notable older monasteries is the [[Choijin Lama Monastery]], a Buddhist monastery that was completed in 1908. It escaped the destruction of Mongolian monasteries when it was turned into a museum in 1942.<ref>{{cite web |url-status=dead |url=http://museum.pixel.mn/english/index.php?id=8,0,0,1,0,0 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531013254/http://museum.pixel.mn/english/index.php?id=8%2C0%2C0%2C1%2C0%2C0|archive-date=31 May 2009 |website=Museums of Mongolia |title=Choijing lama temple museum}}</ref>

Another is the [[Gandantegchinlen Monastery|Gandan Monastery]], which dates to the 19th century. Its most famous attraction is a 26.5-meter-high golden statue of [[Avalokiteśvara|Migjid Janraisig]].<ref>Kohn, pp. 63–64</ref> These monasteries are among the very few in Mongolia to escape the wholesale destruction of Mongolian monasteries under [[Khorloogiin Choibalsan]].

The [[Mongolian Theatre Museum]] presents the history of the performing arts in Mongolia. The city's former Lenin Museum announced plans in January 2013 to convert to a museum showcasing dinosaur and other prehistoric fossils.<ref>{{cite news|last=Branigan|first=Tania|title=It's goodbye Lenin, hello dinosaur as fossils head to Mongolia museum|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/27/goodbye-lenin-dinosaur-mongolia-museum|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=27 January 2013}}</ref>

Pre-1778 artifacts that have never left the city since its founding include the [[Vajradhara]] statue made by Zanabazar himself in 1683 (the city's main deity, kept at the Vajradhara temple); an ornate throne presented to Zanabazar by the [[Kangxi Emperor]] (before 1723); a [[sandalwood]] hat presented to Zanabazar by the [[Dalai Lama]] (c.&nbsp;1663); Zanabazar's large fur coat, also presented by the Kangxi Emperor; and a great number of original statues made by Zanabazar (e.g., the Green [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]]).

The Military Museum of Mongolia features two permanent exhibition halls, commemorating the war history of the country from prehistoric times to the modern era. In the first hall, one can see various tools and weapons from the [[Paleolithic]] age to the times of the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] empire. The second hall showcases the modern history of the Mongolian military, from the [[Bogd Khan]] period (1911–1924) up until Mongolia's recent military involvement in peacekeeping operations.

The city's museum offers a view of Ulaanbaatar's history through old maps and photos. Among the permanent items is a huge painting of the capital as it looked in 1912, showing major landmarks such as [[Gandantegchinlen Monastery|Gandan Monastery]] and the [[Green Palace]]. Part of the museum is dedicated to special photo exhibits that change frequently. The Mongolian Railway History Museum is an open-air museum that displays six types of locomotives used during a 65-year period of Mongolian rail history.

The Puzzle Toys Museum displays a comprehensive collection of complex wooden toys that visitors can assemble.

The [[National Library of Mongolia]] is located in Ulaanbaatar and includes an extensive historical collection, items in non-Mongolian languages and a special children's collection.<ref name="nla.gov.au">{{cite web|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/lapsdir?action=LapsDetails&orgid=23716|title=Metropolitan Central Library of Ulaanbaatar|publisher=Nla.gov.au|date=1 March 2004|access-date=18 April 2012}}</ref>

The Metropolitan Central Library of Ulaanbaatar, sometimes also referred to as the Ulaanbaatar Public Library, is a [[public library]] with a collection of about 500,000 items. It has 232,097 annual users and a total of 497,298 loans per year. It does charge users a registration fee of 3800 to 4250 [[tugrik]], or about US$3.29 to 3.68.

They also host websites on classical and modern [[Mongolian literature]] and food, in addition to providing free internet access.<ref name="nla.gov.au"/>

In 1986, the Ulaanbaatar government created a centralized system for all public libraries in the city, known as the Metropolitan Library System of Ulaanbaatar (MLSU). This system coordinates management, acquisitions, finances and policy among public libraries in the capital, in addition to providing support to school and children's libraries.<ref>[http://www.mclibrary.edu.mn/libraryhistory_eng.html "The 800th Anniversary of Great Mongolian State.

The [[Trans-Mongolian Railway]] crosses the city center in a roughly east-to-west direction, with the main railway hub being [[Ulaanbaatar railway station]].

==== Air ====
Ulaanbaatar is served by [[Chinggis Khaan International Airport]], located {{convert|52|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the city in [[Sergelen, Töv]], which functions as the country's main air hub. It replaced the former [[Buyant-Ukhaa International Airport]] in 2021<ref>{{cite web |date=2021-07-04 |title=New Chinggis Khaan International Airport opens|url=https://montsame.mn/en/read/268963 |website=[[montsame]] |language=en}}</ref> and features flights to destinations in Europe, Asia, and domestic [[Provinces of Mongolia|aimag centers]]. The airport is accessible from Ulaanbaatar via highway with taxis and shuttles operating along the route.

There are 6 helipads in the city.<ref name=":02"/>

==== Future proposals ====
Due to worsening congestion and growth, a number of proposals have been made to improve the city's transport infrastructure, such as the short-lived [[Ulaanbaatar Railbus]], and the proposed [[Ulaanbaatar Metro|subway system]]. On 4 April 2024, the construction of a cable car from Yaarma to the Kharkhorin bus station began.<ref>{{Cite news |date=4 April 2024 |title=The construction of the cable car started |url=https://news.mn/en/800702/ |access-date=10 April 2024 |work=news.mn}}</ref>

=== Energy ===
[[File:Thermal Power Plant No. 4 (Ulaanbaatar).jpg|thumb|[[Thermal Power Plant No. 4 (Ulaanbaatar)|Thermal Power Plant No. 4]]]]

Ulaanbaatar's electricity is mainly supplied through thermal power plants utilizing coal, the largest being [[Thermal Power Plant No. 4 (Ulaanbaatar)|Thermal Power Plant No. 4]]. Aside from generating electricity, they also [[District heating|supply hot water]] throughout the city and heat buildings during the winter months from September to April. Ger districts surrounding the city are not connected to the central heating system, therefore having to rely on burning coal and other materials for heat.

In 2019, the government banned the burning of raw coal within Ulaanbaatar, instead distributing [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] briquettes, claiming fuel efficiency and less smoke pollution.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kwong |first=Emily |date=30 July 2019 |title=Mongolia's Capital Banned Coal To Fix Its Pollution Problem.

=== Water ===
Ulaanbaatar relies entirely on groundwater recharged directly from the [[Tuul River]]. Water provisioning is managed by the Water Supply and Sewage Authority, a municipal agency.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Water Security Woes in Mongolia's Capital |url=https://thediplomat.com/2023/10/water-security-woes-in-mongolias-capital/ |access-date=2023-11-12 |website=The Diplomat |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Pollution==
[[File:Yurt quarter in Ulaanbaatar.jpg|thumb|Ger district in Ulaanbaatar with the Temple of Boddhisattva Avalokiteshvara at Gandantegchinlen Monastery in the background]]
Air pollution is a serious problem in Ulaanbaatar, especially in winter. Concentrations of certain types of [[particulate matter]] (PM10 and PM2.5) regularly exceed [[WHO]] recommended maximum levels by more than a dozen times. They also exceed the concentrations measured in northern Chinese industrial cities. During the winter months, smoke regularly obscures vision, and even led to problems with air traffic at the [[Buyant-Ukhaa International Airport|former airport]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-04-26|title=Air Pollution Puts Lives At Risk Mongolia|url=https://www.borgenmagazine.com/air-pollution-in-mongolia-puts-lives-risk/|access-date=2021-06-02|website=Borgen|language=en-US}}</ref>

Sources of the pollution are mainly the simple stoves used for heating and cooking in the city's [[ger district]]s, but also the local coal-fueled power plants. The problem is compounded by Ulaanbaatar's location in a valley between relatively high mountains, which shield the city from the winter winds and thus obstruct air circulation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hasenkopf|first=Christa|title=Clearing the Air|journal=World Policy Journal|issue=Spring 2012|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/spring2012/clearing-air|access-date=31 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506213627/http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/spring2012/clearing-air|archive-date=6 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Mongolia: Air Pollution in Ulaanbaatar – Initial Assessment of Current Situation and Effects of Abatement Measures|series=Sustainable Development Series: Discussion Paper|date=December 2009| publisher=The World Bank|place=Washington, D.C.|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTMONGOLIA/Resources/Air_pollution_final_report.pdf|access-date=12 May 2011}}</ref>
