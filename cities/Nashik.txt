The name, Nashik, is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word 'nāsikā' which literally means 'nose'. The city of nine hills is also one of the origins of name as per Local Government website.

==History==
{{main|History of Nashik}}

===Mythology===
Nashik was known by many names. It was known as "Padmanagar" during the [[Satya Yuga]], "Trikantak" during the [[Treta Yuga]], "Janasthana" during the [[Dvapara Yuga]], and finally "Navashikh" or "Nashik" during the [[Kali Yuga]], according to Hindu traditions.<ref>{{Cite web |date=10 February 2021 |title=History of Nashik |url=https://www.mintageworld.com/blog/history-of-nashik/ |access-date=17 October 2023 |website=Blog {{!}} Mintage World |language=en-US}}</ref> Nashik is significant in mythology, history, social life, and culture. The city is located on the banks of the [[Godavari River]], making it a sacred site for Hindus around the world. During his 14-year exile from Ayodhya, [[Rama]], the king of [[Ayodhya (Ramayana)|Ayodhya]], is said to have made Nashik his home.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=5 March 2018 |title=Kala Ram Temple, Lord Rama's Home in Nasik |url=https://www.sanskritimagazine.com/kala-ram-temple-lord-ramas-home-in-nasik/ |magazine=Sanskriti Magazine |access-date=14 October 2023}}</ref>

=== Nashik Tram ===
Nashik Tram was started from the Old Municipal Building on the main road to Nashik Road railway station around 1889. The tram served the people of Nashik for almost 44 years.
The tram station was at the Main Road, and the tram reached the Nashik Road railway station via the present Main Road, Bhadrakali Market, Ghasbazar, and Phalke Road. It covered a distance of about eight to ten km, and the stretch used to be covered with dense jungle at the time. In the article ‘Nashik-then’, poet Kusumagraj has written passionately about trams. He writes, "If the carriages were full, the tram would leave. It would ring the bell and drive out of the village to the main road and then to the grass market.<ref name="deshdoot.com"/>

=== Revolutionary activities ===
In the 1900s [[Vinayak Savarkar]] along with his brother founded a secret society [[Abhinav Bharat Society|Abhinav Bharat]] in Nasik Mitra Mela which was one amongst many in Maharashtra. On 21 December 1909 a member of Abhinav Bharat, [[Anant Laxman Kanhere|Anant Kanhere]] a student from [[Aurangabad]] assassinated Nashik's governor [[A. M. T. Jackson]] while he was watching a play in a theatre. Kanhere was arrested on the spot and after investigation, police arrested Vinayak Savarkar and others for conspiring against the government to instigate an armed rebellion. The case was known as the "Nasik Conspiracy Case - 1910".  In the court trial in Bombay, police alleged Savarkar was the brain, moving spirit and inspiration of the conspiracy extending over many years. Bombay court sentenced him to life imprisonment, and transportation to notorious [[Cellular Jail]] at Andaman; Savarkar's elder brother [[Babarao Savarkar]] also received the same punishment and others received varying degrees of imprisonment. ICS officer Jakson's assassination created a sensation in Poona, Nasik and Bombay, the case and subsequently imprisonment made Savarkar famous.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/marathi/india-42465309|newspaper=BBC News मराठी|title= सावरकरांनी...}}</ref><ref name=K>{{Cite book |title=संपूर्ण तलाठी लेखी परीक्षा मार्गदर्शक |publisher=[[Vidyabharti]] |year=2020 |location=[[Latur]] |language=mr}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/libweb/historicalcases/cases/Nasik_Conspiracy_Case_-1910.html|website=Bombayhighcourt.nic.in|title=Nasik Conspiracy Case - 1910|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409230639/http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/libweb/historicalcases/cases/Nasik_Conspiracy_Case_-1910.html |archive-date=9 April 2009 }}</ref> 

In 1930, the Nashik Satyagraha was launched under the leadership of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar for the entry of Dalits in Kalaram Mandir (Temple). In 1931, a meeting of the Bombay Province Charmkar Parishad was organised in Nashik to work out the Chambhars' position concerning the Second Round Table Conference in which Babasaheb was going to participate. In 1932, Babasaheb organised his temple entry movement for the abolition of untouchability in Nashik.<ref>B._R._Ambedkar</ref>

The river [[Godavari]] originates from the [[Brahmagiri (Maharashtra)|Brahmagiri Mountain]], Trimbakeshwar about {{Convert|24|km|abbr=on}} from Nashik, and flows through the old residential settlement, now in the central part of the city. Due to the high pollution created by factories in proximity to the city, the river was dying at an alarming rate. It has since been successfully cleaned.<ref>{{cite web |title=geography |url=http://www.ecoindia.com |access-date=21 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190118214332/http://www.ecoindia.com/ |archive-date=18 January 2019 }}</ref>

=== Climate ===
The city's tropical location and high altitude combine to give it a relatively mild version of a [[Tropical savanna climate|tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Aw)''. Temperatures rise slightly in October, but this is followed by the cool season from November to February. The cool season sees warm temperatures of around {{convert|28|C|F|1|disp=or}} during the day, but cool nights, with lows averaging {{convert|10|C|F|disp=or}}, and extremely dry air.
