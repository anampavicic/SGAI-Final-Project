'''Rennes''' ({{IPA|fr|ʁɛn|-|Fr-Paris--Rennes.ogg}}; {{langx|br|Roazhon}} {{IPA-br|ˈrwɑːõn|}}; [[Gallo language|Gallo]]: ''Resnn''; {{Langx|la|[[Condate Riedonum|Condate Redonum]]}}) is a city in the east of [[Brittany]] in Northwestern [[France]] at the confluence of the rivers [[Ille]] and [[Vilaine]]. Rennes is the prefecture of the [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]] [[Regions of France|region]] and [[Ille-et-Vilaine]] [[Departments of France|department]]. In 2017, its [[Urban unit|urban area]] had a population of 357,327 inhabitants, while the larger [[Functional area (France)|metropolitan area]] had a population of 739,974.<ref name=compar>[https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/1405599?geo=UU2020-35701+AAV2020-013 Comparateur de territoire Unité urbaine 2020 de Rennes (35701), Aire d'attraction des villes 2020 de Rennes (013)], INSEE.</ref> The inhabitants of Rennes are called ''Rennais'' (masculine) and ''Rennaises'' (feminine) in [[French language|French]].

Rennes's history goes back more than 2,000 years to a time when it was a small Gallic village named Condate. Together with [[Vannes]] and [[Nantes]], it was one of the major cities of the ancient [[Duchy of Brittany]]. From the early sixteenth century until the [[French Revolution]], Rennes was a parliamentary, administrative and garrison city of the historic province of [[Brittany]] in the [[Kingdom of France]], as evidenced by its 17th-century [[Parliament of Brittany|Parliament's Palace]]. Rennes played an important role in the Stamped Paper Revolt ([[Revolt of the papier timbré]]) in 1675. After the destructive fire of 1720, the medieval wooden center of the city was partially rebuilt in stone. Remaining mostly [[Rural area|rural]] until the [[World War II|Second World War]], Rennes underwent significant development in the twentieth century.

Since the 1950s, Rennes has grown in importance through [[rural flight]] and modern industrial development, partly in the automotive sector. The city developed extensive building plans to accommodate upwards of 200,000 inhabitants. During the 1980s, Rennes became one of the main centres in [[telecommunications]] and high-tech industry. It is now a significant [[Digital economy|digital]] innovation centre in France. In 2002, Rennes became the smallest city in the world to have a [[Rennes Metro|Metro]] line.

Labeled a city of art and history, it has preserved an important [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Classical architecture|classical]] heritage within its historic center, with over 90 buildings protected as historic monuments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ministère de la Culture – Maintenance|url=http://www2.culture.gouv.fr/redir_pop/index.html?ACTION=CHERCHER&FIELD_1=INSEE&DOM=MH&VALUE_1=35238|access-date=31 October 2020|website=www2.culture.gouv.fr}}</ref> Home to more than [[College town|66,000 students]] in 2016, it is also the eighth-largest university campus of France.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Atlas Régional - Effectis d'étudiants en 2012-2013 |url=http://cache.media.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/file/Atlas_2012-2013/27/8/Atlas_1213_Web_316278.pdf |website=cache.media.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr |access-date=25 March 2015 |archive-date=27 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427212456/http://cache.media.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/file/Atlas_2012-2013/27/8/Atlas_1213_Web_316278.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2018, {{Lang|fr|[[L'Express]]}} named Rennes as "the most liveable city in France".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lexpress.fr/emploi/le-palmares-2018-des-villes-ou-il-fait-bon-vivre-et-travailler_1984924.html|title=Le palmarès 2017 des villes où il fait bon vivre et travailler|date=19 February 2018}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Rennes de hermitage 2.JPG|thumb|right|Green Belt between Rennes and [[L'Hermitage]]]]
The ancient centre of the town is built on a hill, with the north side being more elevated than the south side. It is at the confluence of two rivers: the [[Ille]] and the [[Vilaine]].

Rennes is located on the [[Atlantic Europe|European atlantic arc]], 50&nbsp;km from the [[English Channel]] (near [[Saint-Malo]], [[Dinard]], and [[Mont Saint-Michel]]).

Rennes has the distinction of having a significant [[Green Belt]] around its ring road. This Green Belt is a protected area between the city proper (rather dense) and the rest of its urban area (rather rural).

===Climate===

Rennes features an [[oceanic climate]]. Precipitation in Rennes is considerably less abundant than in the western parts of Brittany, reaching only half of the levels of, e.g., the city of [[Quimper]], which makes rainfall in Rennes comparable to the levels of large parts of western Germany. Sunshine hours range between 1,700 and 1,850 annually, which is about the amount of sunshine received by the city of [[Lausanne]].

==Sights==
Rennes is classified{{by whom|date=November 2024}} as a city of art and history.

===Historic centre===

The historic centre is located on the former plan of the ramparts. There is a difference between the northern city centre and the southern city centre due to the 1720 fire, which destroyed most of the timber-framed houses in the northern part of the city. The rebuilding was done in stone, on a grid plan. The poorer southern part was not rebuilt.

Due to the presence of the ''parlement de Bretagne'', many "[[hôtel particulier|hôtels particuliers]]" were built in the northern part, the richer half of Rennes in the 18th century. Most of the city's [[Monument historique|monuments historiques]] can be found there.

Colourful traditional [[half-timbered]] houses are situated primarily along the roads of Saint-Sauveur, Saint-Georges, de Saint-Malo, Saint-Guillaume, des Dames, du Chapitre, Vasselot, Saint-Michel, de la Psallette and around the plazas of Champ-Jacquet, des Lices, Saint-Anne and Rallier-du-Baty.

==== The Parlement de Bretagne and city hall area ====
The ''[[Parlement de Bretagne]]'' (Administrative and judicial centre of Brittany, {{Langx|br|Breujoù Breizh}}) is the most famous 17th century building in Rennes. It was rebuilt after a terrible fire in 1994 that may have been caused by a flare fired by a protester during a demonstration. It houses the Rennes [[Court of Appeal (France)|Court of Appeal]]. The surrounding plaza is built in the [[classical architecture|classical]] style.

In the west, the Place de la Mairie (City Hall Plaza, Plasenn Ti Kêr):
* City Hall
* Opera

In the east, at the end of the ''Rue Saint-Georges'' with traditional [[half-timbered]] houses: 
* 1920s Saint George Municipal Pool, with mosaics
* [[Saint George Palace]], and its garden

In the south-east:
* Saint-Germain square
** Saint-Germain Church
** Saint-Germain footbridge, 20th century wood and metal construction that links the plaza with Émile Zola Quay, across the [[Vilaine]] River.

==== The Place des Lices and cathedral area ====

The Place des Lices is lined by [[hôtel particulier|hôtels particuliers]]. Along with the Place Rallier-du-Baty, it is the location of the weekly big market, the marché des Lices.

Near the [[Rennes Cathedral]] (cathédrale Saint-Pierre de Rennes) is the Rue du Chapitre:
* [[Hôtel de Blossac]]
* There are 16th century polychrome wooden busts on the façade of 20, Rue du Chapitre.

Also in this area are the former St. Yves chapel, which is now the tourist office and a local historical museum, and the Basilica Saint-Sauveur.

Built from the 3rd to the 12th centuries, the ramparts were largely destroyed between the beginning of the 16th century and the 1860s.

In the south-west of the area, ''La Rue Saint-Michel'' nicknamed ''Rue de La Soif'' (''Road of Thirst''), is known for its many bars. Meanwhile, in the south-east, the Place du Champ-Jacquet features Renaissance buildings and a statue of mayor Jean Leperdit ripping up a [[conscription]] list.
