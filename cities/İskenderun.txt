Located on an [[alluvial plain]], the city was heavily damaged by [[2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake|powerful earthquakes]] in February 2023 and subsequent aftershocks, floods and fires.

The city's history dates back to 333 BC, when it was founded by [[Alexander the Great]] as Alexandretta. It subsequently fell under [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] rule before being conquered by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. After defeating the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] in the 8th century, the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] gained control of the city. During the [[First Crusade]], it came under the control of the [[Principality of Antioch]] before being captured by the [[Mamluk Sultanate]].

By the 15th century, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] had conquered the city, maintaining control over it until the [[partition of the Ottoman Empire]] after the Allied victory in [[World War I]]. It subsequently became a [[Sanjak of Alexandretta|sanjak]] in the [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French mandate of Syria]] until 1938, when France granted the region independence. The city became part of the [[Hatay State]] which in turn united with Turkey in 1939.

==Name==
The city was founded as '''Alexandria''' (Ἀλεξάνδρεια) to commemorate [[Alexander the Great]]'s victory over the [[Persians|Persian]] [[Darius III]] at [[Issus (Cilicia)]] in (333 BC). Starting in the Middle Ages, Western [[pilgrim]]s used the diminutive [[Romance languages|Romance]] form '''Alexandretta'''.<ref>''[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]'', 2nd edition, ''s.v.'' Iskandarūn</ref>

==History==
[[File:Baghras2.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Bagras|Bagras Castle]] on the [[Nur Mountains|Nur (Amanos) Mountains]] near İskenderun]]

===Antiquity===
İskenderun preserves the name, but probably not the exact site, of ''Alexandria ad Issum''. The settlement was so called having been founded by [[Alexander the Great]] in 333 BC to supersede [[Myriandus]] as the key to the [[Syrian Gates]], about 37&nbsp;km (23 miles) south of the scene of his victory at the [[Battle of Issus]] against the Persian [[Darius III|King Darius III]].<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alexandretta|volume=1|page=568|first=David George|last=Hogarth|author-link=David George Hogarth}}</ref> Alexander camped in the highlands of İskenderun, around ''Esentepe'', and then ordered the city to be established and named ''Alexandria''. İskenderun is one of many cities founded on Alexander's orders, including [[Alexandria|Alexandria, Egypt]]. A memorial, a monument and a bronze statue for the victory were raised at the city, and [[Herodian]] writes that they were there even during his time, {{Circa|200 AD}}.<ref>[http://cts.perseids.org/read/greekLit/tlg0015/tlg001/opp-grc1/3.4 Herodian, History of the Empire, §3.4.1]</ref>

The importance of the place comes from its relation to the aforesaid Syrian Gates, the easiest approach to the open ground of Hatay Province and [[Aleppo]].<ref name="EB1911"/> Because of its hilly, rough surroundings, the city also went by the name of ''Alexandria Scabiosa'' ('Alexandria the Mountainous').<ref name="cath">''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', 1908, ''s.v.'' [[wikisource:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Cambysopolis|Cambysopolis]]</ref>

===Ecclesiastical history===
{{Main|Diocese of Alexandretta}}
[[File:Antioch Alexandria and Seleucia.png|thumb|left|The Peutinger Map showing İskenderun and Seleucia in the 4th century.]]The [[bishopric]] of Alexandria Minor was a [[suffragan]] of [[Anazarbus]], the capital and so also the [[ecclesiastical metropolis]] of the [[Roman province]] of [[Cilicia Secunda]]. Greek [[Menologium|menologia]] speak of [[Helenus of Alexandria (Cilicia)|Saint Helenus]], and the [[martyr]] saints [[Saint Aristion|Aristio]] and [[Theodore the Martyr|Theodore]] as early bishops of the [[Episcopal see|See]]. But the first documented one is Hesychius, who took part in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 and in a synod at Antioch in 341. Philomusus participated in the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381. Baranes is mentioned in connection with a [[synod]] at [[Antioch]] in 445. At the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, Julianus was represented by his metropolitan, Cyrus of Anazarbus. Basilius was at the synod in [[Constantinople]] in 459 that condemned [[simony|simoniacs]]. In 518, Paulus was deposed by the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian]] for supporting the [[Jacobite Church|Jacobite]] [[Severus of Antioch]].<ref>Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 903-906</ref><ref>Siméon Vailhé, v. ''Alexandria minor ou Alexandrette'', in [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6561037d/f162.image ''Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de Géographie ecclésiastiques''], vol. II, Paris 1914, coll. 287-289</ref>

[[File:İskenderunSahil.JPG|thumb|The district center and [[Gulf of Alexandretta|Gulf]] of İskenderun]]

No longer a residential diocese, [[Diocese of Alexandretta|Alexandria Minor]] is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].<ref name=AP>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 829</ref> In that list it was long named Cambysopolis,<ref name="cath"/> but the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' now gives the correct ancient name.

===Ottoman era===
There was fighting here under the [[Ottoman Empire]]: in 1606 the army of General [[Kuyucu Murat Pasha]] suppressed the [[Jelali revolts]]. The Ottomans continued to fortify the city, and the remains of the early 17th-century Ottoman castle walls can still be seen where the Güzün stream crosses the Varyant road. The city was well described in 1675 by the English naval chaplain [[Henry Teonge]] in his diary. The next army to cross the [[Belen Pass]] and attack [[Anatolia]] through here were the [[Egyptians]] of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] in 1832.

[[File:IskenderunShoreline092012.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] from the promenade of İskenderun]]
However, in the later Ottoman period the city developed as the main port on the Mediterranean for the overland trade from [[Baghdad]] and [[India]], which had great importance until the establishment of the [[Egypt]]ian overland route. Alexandretta served as a base, first for [[Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Venice|Venetian]] merchants, then Western and Northern European merchants. The British [[Levant Company]] maintained an agency and [[factor (agent)|factory]] here for 200 years, until 1825, in spite of high mortality among its employees<ref name="EB1911"/> because of regional disease, some due to lack of sanitation systems. During the 19th century the port grew, and the road to [[Aleppo]] was improved.{{Citation needed|date=April 2023}} Sanitation was also improved,<ref name="EB1911"/> and the railway was built in 1912.

At the outset of [[World War I]], when Britain was contemplating the [[partition of the Ottoman Empire]], [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] considered the conquest of Alexandretta to be essential in providing Britain with a port and railhead from which to access [[Iraq]]. He proposed a new railway be built to the east from Alexandretta, which would greatly reduce the time for reaching India from the UK. The De Bunsen Committee (8 April – 30 June 1915), a British inter-departmental group which was set up to discuss the issue in greater detail, preferred [[Haifa]] for this purpose.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Peace to End all Peace|first=David |last=Fromkin|author-link=David Fromkin|year=1989|page=149}}</ref>

Ultimately the British decided not to attack the Ottoman Empire via Alexandretta. On 8 February 1915 the French foreign minister, [[Théophile Delcassé]], protested to Britain's Foreign Secretary, [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] about such an attack, citing a commitment that Britain made in 1912 that it had no designs on Syria.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Line in the Sand|author=James Barr|author-link=James Barr (author)|year=2011|page=15}}</ref> The German field marshal, [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]], later said that 
<blockquote>Perhaps not the whole course of the war, but certainly the fate of our Ottoman Ally, could have been settled out of hand, if England had secured a decision in that region, or even seriously attempted it. Possession of the country south of the Tauras [mountains] would have been lost to Turkey at a blow if the English had succeeded in landing at Alexandretta.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Neglected War: Mesopotamia 1914-1918|author=A.J. Barker|year=1967|page=472}}</ref></blockquote>[[File:TurkishArmyAlexandretta.jpeg|thumb|Turkish forces under Colonel Şükrü Kanatlı entered İskenderun on 5 July 1938]] [[Armenians]], who have maintained a cultural and economic presence in Iskenderun for centuries, most notably due to trade, were wiped out in the [[Hamidian massacres|Hamidian Massacres]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hamidian-massacres|title=Hamidian massacres &#124; Ottoman and Armenian history}}</ref> [[Adana massacre|Adana Massacres]],<ref>[https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1124&context=historyfacpub From Bloodless Revolution to Bloody Counterrevolution: The Adana Massacres of 1909]</ref> and the [[Armenian genocide]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Armenian-Genocide|title = Armenian Genocide &#124; History, Causes, & Facts| date=20 June 2023 }}</ref> after centuries of discrimination.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}}

===Republic of Hatay===
{{Main|Hatay State}}
Following the collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]] at the end of the [[First World War]], most of Hatay including İskenderun was occupied by French troops.

In July 1920 the [[San Remo conference]] did not assign Alexandretta sanjak to [[Turkey]].<ref name="doi_10.1093/ia/iix118">{{cite journal|author=[[I.

The [[Republic of Hatay]] was founded in 1938 and, in 1939, it joined the Republic of Turkey after a referendum. The referendum was, and still is, regarded as illegitimate, as the Turkish government moved supporters into the city<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/fisk/robert-fisk-syria-is-used-to-the-slings-and-arrows-of-friends-and-enemies-6297648.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220507/https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/fisk/robert-fisk-syria-is-used-to-the-slings-and-arrows-of-friends-and-enemies-6297648.html |archive-date=7 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Robert Fisk: Syria is used to the slings and arrows of friends and enemies|last=Fisk|first=Robert|date=1 February 2012|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|quote=French handed it over to Turkey after a fraudulent referendum|access-date=15 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/a-land-in-the-shadow-of-death-1283939.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220507/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/a-land-in-the-shadow-of-death-1283939.html |archive-date=7 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=A LAND IN THE SHADOW OF DEATH|last=Fisk|first=Robert|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|quote=After engineering a fraudulent referendum in north-west Syria – the Turks trucked their supporters into the city|access-date=15 September 2013}}</ref> and the [[Turkish Army]] "expelled most of the province's Alawite Arabs, Greek and Armenian majority" to decide the referendum result.<ref name="JackKalpakian">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EmlX4Y7PMjgC&pg=PA130|title=Identity, Conflict and Cooperation in International River Systems|author=Jack Kalpakian|edition=Hardcover|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2004|isbn=0-7546-3338-1|page=130|quote=Turkish army ... expelled most the province's Alawite Arabs and Armenian majority.

In the 2010s Syria still claimed against Turkey its sovereignty on the Alexandretta region.<ref name="doi_10.1093/ia/iix118" />

=== Modern era ===
At the [[2013 Turkish local government reorganisation|2013 reorganisation]], İskenderun district lost a large part of its territory to the new district [[Arsuz]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Law No. 6360|url=https://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2012/12/20121206-1.htm |date=6 December 2012 |work=[[Official Gazette of the Republic of Turkey|Official Gazette]]|language=tr}}</ref>

===Climate===
İskenderun has a [[Mediterranean climate]] with hot, dry summers, and mild, moderately rainy winters (''[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate|Csa]],'' Trewartha'': [[Mediterranean climate|Cs]]''). At certain times of the year the town is swept by a strong wind called 'Yarıkkaya'. The countryside contains large areas of fruit groves. It is an important producer of [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[tangerines]] and [[lemons]], and even tropical fruits such as [[mango]]es.

==Demographics==
19th-century traveler [[Martin Hartmann]] put the population of Iskenderun at roughly 500 households with no entry on ethnicity. Out of the 29 other settlements he listed in the Ottoman [[nahiyah]] of Iskenderun, 19 were [[Turkish people|Turkish]] (366 houses), 2 were [[Alawite]] (100 houses), 2 were Turkish-Alawite mixed (28 houses), and no information was listed for the remaining 6.
