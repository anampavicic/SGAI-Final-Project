Many years ago, Pulilan was primarily a little-known rural town in the northern part of Bulacan where its economy heavily dependent on farming and poultry raising. Most of the population committed their entire lives on farming as their livelihood. Today, the town is moving towards commercialization and industrialization as it is becoming one of the major growth-rate area and center of commerce and industry in the province.

Because of the major economic growth, due to presence of commercial establishments, real estates, industrial plants and major road projects. Pulilan has experienced increased in the total gross income in the past few years. The town's income in year 2016 was P323.86&nbsp;million, an increase of P69.27&nbsp;million from its previous income in 2014. It surpass the income of fifteen municipalities in 
[[Bulacan]] such as [[San Miguel, Bulacan|San Miguel]], [[Bocaue]], [[Plaridel, Bulacan|Plaridel]], [[Hagonoy, Bulacan|Hagonoy]] and [[Calumpit]].

With the continuous expansion of [[Metro Manila]], Pulilan is part of [[Greater Manila Area|Manila's built-up area]] which reaches [[San Ildefonso, Bulacan]] at its northernmost part.

==Etymology==
In the beginning, Pulilan is neither its name nor a town.  History has it that the place is a marshy or swampland which forms part of [[Pampanga]], along the [[Candaba|Candaba Bay]]. Because of the vastness of its area, Pulilan was created out of the districts of [[Baliuag]] and Quingua (now [[Plaridel, Bulacan|Plaridel]]) and coming from the Pampango word "''Kengwa''", meaning on the other side of the shore or kabilang ibayo. In 1794, the place was named ''San Isidro'' by the missionary Augustinian friars in honor of San Isidro Labrador, the patron saint of the farmers. On January 20, 1796, it was called ''Pulilan''. There are no written records how the place is named Pulilan. But legend has it that is derived from ''Pulo ng Ilan'', literally, clusters of small communities or isles. According to [[Antoon Postma]] in his "The [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] (LCI) – A Valuable Philippine Document" this copperplate with inscription discovered at Lumbang River near the Laguna Lake area in Laguna dates back to 900 A.D. In this inscription was mentioned the name ''Puliran'', as the old name for southeastern lake area. The toponyms or place names Puliran is Pulilan, Bulacan and Pulilan is in [[Laguna de Bay]]. However, Mr. Postma is convinced in his studies that Pulilan in the LCI is the Pulilan along the [[Angat River]], in the Province of Bulacan, north of [[Manila]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lexalia.org/oldmalay/archives/postma1992laguna.pdf|title= The Laguna Copperplate Inscription|author=Antoon Postma|access-date= July 13, 2018|author-link= Antoon Postma}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bulacanpnp.com/PS%20PULILAN.html|title=History of Pulilan Police Station|access-date=July 13, 2018}}</ref>

==History==
{{see also | Laguna Copperplate Inscription | Greater India | Indosphere}}

The first time Pulilan was settled was unknown but if existing records of the towns of Calumpit and Baliuag, between which the town lies, be made a basis, it could be deduced that in the early part of the 17th century it could have had a sprinkling of settlers. However, the ancient town of Pulilan was first documented as Puliran in the [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]], a pre-colonial oldest document of Philippines written in 900 A.D in [[Greater India|Indianized]] [[Indosphere|script]]. The native population at the time of the document were ruled by the sovereign Lord Ka-Sumuran (see [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]]).

During Spanish regime, an Augustian fray, Fray Vicente Villamanzaro, was made to declare the settlement of a town on January 20, 1796. It was assigned a patron saint, San Isidro Labrador, after whose name he wanted the town identified. On this time, the head of the town was called [[Barangay Captain|Kapitan]]. It was only in 1819 that Pulilan has as its first Kapitan, Kapitan Francisco Paltao. In 1898, the first Presidente Municipal was Froilan Cahiwat. In 1904, when Anacleto Batongbacal was the Presidente Municipal, Pulilan was annexed to Quingua and became its sitio. In 1908, as the Pulilenos rallied behind the candidacy of their son Adriano Salvador, he was elected Presidente Municipal of Quinqua. Then in 1909, representations were made by Eugenio Tiangco, Hilario Esguerra, Adriano Salvador and others with Governor Teodoro Sandico to separate Pulilan from Quingua. It was granted.  Pulilan then became a town, with Eugenio Tiangco as its Presidente. In 1946, Catalino Flores was appointed as the first Mayor of Pulilan.

From the Spanish time to American occupation and lately the Japanese era, many sons of the town of Pulilan shed their blood. After long march to freedom, Pulilenos started to build from its small beginnings and from then on made a great stride in politics, economy, social standing and in other fields. The influence of the Spanish, American and Japanese occupations, have in a measure, contributed to the promotion of their welfare, but the Pulileños, as they are known, treasure their great heritage. San Isidro Labrador or Saint Isidore the Laborer, the patron saint of the farmers, is the patron saint of the town as well. The traditional date of his liturgical feast, which through not included in the General Roman Calendar has been celebrated for centuries in several countries and diocese is May 15. However, it is in the 14th day of May that Pulileños (people of Pulilan) celebrate the feast in honor of their saint by parading carabaos and making them kneel in front of the church as a sign of respect for their patron saint of farmers. Also included in the parade are cows, horses, street folk dancers, marching bands and floats of commercial establishments of the town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pulilan.gov.ph/history.php|title=Pulilan History|publisher=Municipality of Pulilan Official Website|access-date=July 13, 2018}}</ref>

The legislative branch is composed of the Sanguniang Bayan (town council) and Sanguniang Barangay (Barangay council). The council is in charge of creating the municipality's policies in the form of ordinances and resolutions. The Mayor is the executive head and leads the municipal department in executing ordinances and improving public services. The Vice Mayor heads a council consisting of 10 members, 8 councilors, and 2 ex-officio members (''ABC President'' and ''SK Federation President'').

All of the barangays in the municipality is administrated by its duly-elected barangay captain. The barangay captain is aided by the [[Sangguniang Barangay]] (Barangay Council) whose members, seven Barangay Kagawad (Councilors), are also elected.
