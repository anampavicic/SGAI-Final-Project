A major industrial and commercial center, it is the region's fourth-largest city after [[Cali]]—the department capital—[[Palmira, Valle del Cauca|Palmira]] and [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]]. Founded around 1741 by Juan de Lemos y Aguirre, it has a population of approximately 178,000. It is also known as the ''Corazón del Valle'' (meaning 'The Heart of Valle'), as ''La Villa de Céspedes'' ('Town of Céspedes', named after the naturalist Juan María Céspedes) and ''Tierra Fácil'' ('Easy Land' in the native language).

It is well known throughout Colombia and many parts of South America as a major center of [[salsa (dance)|salsa dancing]].
