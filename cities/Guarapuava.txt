'''Guarapuava''' is a [[municipality]] in the state of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] in Brazil. It is the largest [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in that state by area. Considered a regional development hub with a strong influence on neighboring municipalities, it is also part of a railroad junction of national importance called the Mercosur corridor, between the municipalities of Foz do Iguaçu and Curitiba. It is the richest [[agribusiness]] municipality in the state of Paraná.

Guarapuava is located at 25°23'36" S and 51°27'19" W. The region is known as the centre of the state of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], in the third plateau, also called the '''Plateau of Guarapuava'''. Discovered by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in 1770, and founded in 1810, the city's name derives from ''tupi guarani'', meaning ''place of Maned wolves sound'' (Maned wolves are called ''lobos-guará'' in Portuguese).  Its elevation is 1120&nbsp;m (3675&nbsp;ft).

The first families to settle in the city were formed through the [[Tropeiros]]. These families had their roots in Poland, Italy, and Germany. The city's birthday is celebrated on December 9, due to the beginning of colonization between Rio Coutinho and Rio Jordão, under the patronage of Nossa Senhora de Belém in 1819.

The city is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Guarapuava]].

==History==

Discovered by the Portuguese in 1770 and founded in 1810, the city name derives from the [[Tupí Austral|Língua Geral of São Paulo]] ''agûarápuaba'', meaning 'place of maned wolf's sound' (gûará, [[Maned wolf]] + pu, sound/noise + aba, place).<ref>[[Eduardo de Almeida Navarro|Navarro, E. A.]] ''[[Dictionary of Old Tupi|Dicionário de tupi antigo: a língua indígena clássica do Brasil]]''. São Paulo. Ática. 2013. p. 563.</ref> The city commemorates its anniversary on December 9, due to the onset of colonization between Rio Coutinho and the Rio Jordão in the parish of Our Lady of Bethlehem in 1819, with the demarcation of village and church.

The first villages started up near Jaguariaíva, Piraí, Furnas, Castro, and Iapó Pouso of Ponta Grossa. Cities formed along the long path south until you come near the region where it is today the City of Guarapuava.

Its urban area played an important role in its initial phase, with Chagas Father Francisco Lima starting the occupation based on aesthetic criteria, following the requirements contained in the charter of April 1, 1809, by the Count of Linhares, which determined the standards for the buildings to be constructed. As for the point-core, it refers to the Cathedral of Our Lady of Bethlehem, located at the top of the River Basin Cascavel, which was an important reference point for society of the time. The first mayor of Guarapuava was Colonel Pedro Lustosa de Siqueira.

In the year 1852, on July 17, the town of Our Lady of Bethlehem, was elevated to the category of town. On May 2, 1859, the district was created in Guarapuava, and José Antônio Araújo Vasconcelos became the first court of law. The Town of Our Lady of Bethlehem was granted city status on April 12, 1871, by Law No. 271, separating it from the municipality of Castro.

==Economy==

The agricultural sector represents approximately 18% of the composition of GDP. The council has strong participation in agricultural production in the state. It is one of the largest producers of Maris Piper potatoes in Brazil and also a major producer of corn, soybeans, and barley. The industry has a 35% share of the GDP, and the timber industry is the industrial activity that employs the most. Manufacture of paper and cardboard, beverages, chemical byproducts, and agro-food industry also have strong participation. The service sector is growing gradually and now includes about 47% of Guarapuava's GDP.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Education==
In 2006, there were 68 state-run schools.
Guarapuava has two public universities, the 'Universidade Estadual do Centro-Oeste' and the 'Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná', and three private colleges, 'Faculdade Guarapuava', 'Centro Universitário Campo Real', and 'Faculdade Guairacá'.

Through Municipal Law 14/1988, Guarapuava has been declared a [[Sister city|Twin Town]], or ''Cidade Irmã,'' with [[Rastatt]], a city in Germany.
