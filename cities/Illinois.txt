'''Illinois''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Illinois.ogg|ˌ|ɪ|l|ɪ|ˈ|n|ɔɪ}} {{respell|IL|in|OY|'}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] region of the [[United States]]. It borders [[Lake Michigan]] to its northeast, the [[Mississippi River]] to its west, and the [[Wabash River|Wabash]] and [[Ohio River|Ohio river]]s to its south.{{efn|Illinois borders the state of [[Wisconsin]] to its north, [[Iowa]] to its northwest, [[Missouri]] to its southwest, [[Kentucky]] to its south, [[Indiana]] to its east, and has a water border with [[Michigan]] to the northeast in [[Lake Michigan]].}} Of the fifty U.S. states, Illinois has the [[List of U.S. states and territories by GDP|fifth-largest gross domestic product (GDP)]], the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|sixth-largest population]], and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|25th-most land area]]. Its capital is [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]].

Present-day Illinois was inhabited by Indigenous cultures for thousands of years. The French were the first Europeans to arrive, settling near the Mississippi and [[Illinois River]] in the 17th century as part of the sprawling colony of [[New France]]. Following [[American Revolutionary War|U.S. independence in 1783]], American settlers began arriving from [[Kentucky]] via the Ohio River. Illinois was part of the United States' oldest territory, the [[Northwest Territory]], and in 1818 it achieved [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|statehood]]. The [[Erie Canal]] brought increased commercial activity in the Great Lakes, and the invention of the self-scouring [[plough|steel plow]] by Illinoisan [[John Deere (inventor)|John Deere]] turned the state's rich [[prairie]] into some of the world's most productive and valuable farmland, attracting [[Immigration to the United States|immigrant]] farmers from [[German American|Germany]] and [[Swedish American|Sweden]]. In the mid-19th century, the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] and a sprawling railroad network facilitated trade, commerce, and settlement, making the state a transportation hub for the nation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.niu.edu/1999/iht639920.html |title=The Historical Development of Transportation in Illinois |last=Ryburn-LaMonte |first=Terri |date=1999 |website=Illinois Periodicals Online |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010220837/http://www.lib.niu.edu/1999/iht639920.html |archive-date=October 10, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> By 1900, the growth of industrial jobs in the northern cities and [[coal]] mining in the central and southern areas attracted immigrants from [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southern Europe]].

Two [[World Heritage Site]]s are in Illinois, the ancient [[Cahokia Mounds]], and part of the [[The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright|Wright architecture]] site.

==Etymology==
{{See also|Illinois Confederation|List of counties in Illinois}}

"Illinois" is the modern spelling for the early [[French language|French]] [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] and explorers' name for the [[Illinois Confederation|Illinois]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], a name that was spelled in many different ways in the early records.<ref>{{cite web |last=Fay |first=Jim |date=May 11, 2010 |url=http://www.illinoisprairie.info/Eriniouaj.htm |title=Ilinois, Illini and Liniouek |access-date=August 1, 2021 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623234945/http://www.illinoisprairie.info/Eriniouaj.htm |archive-date=June 23, 2010 |publisher=The Illinois Prairie Information Page}}</ref>

American scholars previously thought the name ''Illinois'' meant 'man' or 'men' in the [[Miami-Illinois language]], with the original {{lang|mia|iliniwek}} transformed via French into Illinois.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hodge |first=Frederick Webb |author-link=Frederick Webb Hodge |title=Handbook of American Indians north of Mexico, Volume 1 |year=1911 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology |oclc=26478613 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ze4YAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA597 |page=597 |isbn=9781404740303 |access-date=October 3, 2020 |archive-date=February 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210204132005/https://books.google.com/books?id=ze4YAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA597 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=George R. |author-link= George R.

The name ''Illinois'' derives from the Miami-Illinois verb {{lang|mia|irenwe·wa}} 'he speaks the regular way'. This was taken into the [[Ojibwe language]], perhaps in the [[Ottawa dialect]], and modified into {{lang|otw|ilinwe·}} (pluralized as {{lang|otw|ilinwe·k}}). The French borrowed these forms, spelling the {{IPA|/we/}} ending as {{lang|fr|-ois}}, a [[transliteration]] of that sound in the French of that time. The current spelling form, ''Illinois'', began to appear in the early 1670s, when French colonists had settled in the western area. The Illinois's name for themselves, as attested in all three of the French missionary-period dictionaries of Illinois, was {{lang|mia|[[Inoka]]}}, of unknown meaning and unrelated to the other terms.<ref>{{cite book |last=Callary |first=Edward |title=Place Names of Illinois |year=2008 |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]] |isbn=978-0-252-03356-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvHgwa-XImcC&pg=PA169 |page=169 |access-date=October 3, 2020 |archive-date=February 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210204131219/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvHgwa-XImcC&pg=PA169 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Costa |first=David J. |date=January 2007 |title=Three American Placenames: Illinois |journal=Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas Newsletter |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=9–12 |issn=1046-4476 |url=http://myaamia.strackattack.com/OtherFiles/CostaNewsletter.pdf#page=9 |access-date= May 29, 2011 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110716151840/http://myaamia.strackattack.com/OtherFiles/CostaNewsletter.pdf#page=9 |archive-date= July 16, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]] of successive cultures lived along the waterways of the Illinois area for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. The [[Koster Site]] has been excavated and demonstrates 7,000 years of continuous habitation. [[Cahokia]], the largest regional [[chiefdom]] and [[Urban center|Urban Center]] of the [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] [[Mississippian culture]], was located near present-day [[Collinsville, Illinois]].

The civilization vanished in the 15th century for unknown reasons, but historians and archeologists have speculated that the people depleted the area of resources.

French explorers [[Jacques Marquette]] and [[Louis Jolliet]] explored the [[Illinois River]] in 1673. Marquette soon after founded a mission at the [[Grand Village of the Illinois]] in [[Illinois Country]]. In 1680, French explorers under [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] and [[Henri de Tonti]] constructed a fort at the site of present-day [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]], and in 1682, a fort atop [[Starved Rock]] in today's Starved Rock State Park. French Empire [[Canadiens]] came south to settle particularly along the Mississippi River, and Illinois was part of first [[New France]], and then of [[La Louisiane]] until 1763, when it passed to the British with their defeat of France in the [[Seven Years' War]]. The small French settlements continued, although many French migrated west to [[Ste. Genevieve, Missouri|Ste. Genevieve]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri]], to evade British rule.<ref name="Biles" />

A few British soldiers were posted in Illinois, but few British or American settlers moved there, as the Crown made it part of the territory reserved for Indians west of the Appalachians, and then part of the [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|British Province of Quebec]]. In 1778, [[George Rogers Clark]] claimed [[Illinois County]] for [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]]. In a compromise, Virginia (and other states that made various claims) ceded the area to the new United States in the 1780s and it became part of the [[Northwest Territory]], administered by the federal government and later organized as states.<ref name="Biles">{{cite book |last=Biles |first=Roger |title=Illinois: A History of the Land and its People |year=2005 |publisher=Northern Illinois University Press |location=DeKalb |isbn=978-0-87580-349-4}}</ref>

====Prior to statehood====
[[File:Kaskaskia Bell 3321.jpg|thumb|right|The bell donated by King Louis XV in 1741 to the French mission at Kaskaskia. It was later called the "Liberty Bell of the West", after it was rung to celebrate U.S. victory in the Revolution]]
The [[Illinois-Wabash Company]] was an early claimant to much of Illinois. The [[Illinois Territory]] was created on February 3, 1809, with its capital at [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], an early French settlement.

During the discussions leading up to Illinois's [[admission to the Union]], the proposed northern boundary of the state was moved twice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sancohis.org/presentations/Illinois%20From%20Territory%20to%20State.htm |title=Full Remarks from Dave M |publisher=Sancohis.org |date=March 16, 2010 |access-date=February 7, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> The original provisions of the [[Northwest Ordinance]] had specified a boundary that would have been tangent to the southern tip of Lake Michigan. Such a boundary would have left Illinois with no shoreline on Lake Michigan at all. However, as Indiana had successfully been granted a {{cvt|10|mi|adj=on}} northern extension of its boundary to provide it with a usable lakefront, the original bill for Illinois statehood, submitted to Congress on January 23, 1818, stipulated a northern border at the same latitude as Indiana's, which is defined as 10 miles north of the southernmost extremity of Lake Michigan. However, the Illinois delegate, [[Nathaniel Pope]], wanted more, and lobbied to have the boundary moved further north. The final bill passed by Congress included an amendment to shift the border to 42° 30' north, which is approximately {{cvt|51|mi}} north of the Indiana northern border. This shift added {{cvt|8500|sqmi|4=-2}} to the state, including the [[lead mining]] region near [[Galena, Illinois|Galena]]. More importantly, it added nearly 50 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline and the Chicago River. Pope and others envisioned a canal that would connect the Chicago and Illinois rivers and thus connect the Great Lakes to the Mississippi.

The ethnic French had owned black slaves since the 1720s, and American settlers had already brought slaves into the area from [[Kentucky]]. Slavery was nominally banned by the Northwest Ordinance, but that was not enforced for those already holding slaves.

The adverse weather resulted in crop failures in the northern part of the state.

After it was established in 1833, [[Chicago]] gained prominence as a [[Great Lakes]] port, and then as an [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] port after 1848, and as a rail hub soon afterward. By 1857, Chicago was Illinois's largest city.<ref name="Biles" /> With the tremendous growth of mines and factories in the state in the 19th century, Illinois was the ground for the formation of [[labor unions in the United States]].

In 1847, after lobbying by [[Dorothea Dix|Dorothea L.

Dix came into this effort after having met J. O. King, a [[Jacksonville, Illinois]] businessman, who invited her to Illinois, where he had been working to build an asylum for the insane.

==Geology==
{{Main|Geology of Illinois}}
During the early part of the [[Paleozoic Era]], the area that would one day become Illinois was submerged beneath a shallow sea and located near the Equator. Diverse marine life lived at this time, including [[trilobite]]s, [[brachiopod]]s, and [[crinoid]]s. Changing environmental conditions led to the formation of large [[Coal forest|coal swamps]] in the [[Carboniferous]].

Illinois was above sea level for at least part of the [[Mesozoic]], but by its end was again submerged by the [[Western Interior Seaway]]. This receded by the [[Eocene|Eocene Epoch]].

During the [[Pleistocene Epoch]], vast ice sheets covered much of Illinois, with only the [[Driftless Area]] remaining exposed. These [[glacier]]s carved the basin of [[Lake Michigan]] and left behind traces of ancient glacial lakes and [[moraine]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Willman |first1=Harold Bowen |last2=Atherton |first2=Elwood |last3=Buschbach |first3=T.

==Geography==

{{Main|Geography of Illinois}}
{{Further|List of ecoregions in Illinois}}

Illinois is located in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest region]] of the United States and is one of the eight states in the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]] of North America (which also includes [[Ontario]], Canada).

===Boundaries===

Illinois's eastern border with [[Indiana]] consists of a north–south line at 87° 31′ 30″ west longitude in [[Lake Michigan]] at the north, to the [[Wabash River]] in the south above [[Vincennes, Indiana|Post Vincennes]]. The Wabash River continues as the eastern/southeastern border with Indiana until the Wabash enters the [[Ohio River]]. This marks the beginning of Illinois's southern border with [[Kentucky]], which runs along the northern shoreline of the Ohio River.<ref>[[Wikisource]]. [[s:Illinois Constitution of 1818|Illinois Constitution of 1818]].</ref> Most of the western border with [[Missouri]] and [[Iowa]] is the [[Mississippi River]]; Kaskaskia is an [[exclave]] of Illinois, lying west of the Mississippi and reachable only from Missouri. The state's northern border with [[Wisconsin]] is fixed at 42° 30′ north latitude. The northeastern border of Illinois lies in [[Lake Michigan]], within which Illinois shares a water boundary with the state of [[Michigan]], as well as Wisconsin and Indiana.<ref name="Nelson">{{cite book |editor=Nelson, Ronald E. |title=Illinois: Land and Life in the Prairie State |year=1978 |publisher=Kendall/Hunt |location=Dubuque, IA |isbn=978-0-8403-1831-2 |oclc=4499416}}</ref>

===Topography===

[[File:Looking eastward at Charles Mound, the highest point in Illinois.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Mound]], the highest natural point in Illinois at {{convert|1,235|ft}} above sea level, is located in the [[Driftless Area]] in the northwestern part of the state.]]

Though Illinois lies entirely in the [[Interior Plains]], it does have some minor variation in its elevation. In extreme northwestern Illinois, the [[Driftless Area]], a region of unglaciated and therefore higher and more rugged topography, occupies a small part of the state. [[Southern Illinois]] includes the hilly areas around the [[Shawnee National Forest]].

[[Charles Mound]], located in the Driftless region, has the state's highest natural elevation above sea level at {{cvt|1235|ft}}. Other highlands include the [[Shawnee Hills]] in the south, and there is varying topography along its rivers; the [[Illinois River]] bisects the state northeast to southwest. The floodplain on the Mississippi River from [[Alton, Illinois|Alton]] to the [[Kaskaskia River]] is known as the [[American Bottom]].

===Divisions===

[[File:Cairo Ohio River Bridge at sunset.jpg|thumb|At {{convert|279|ft}} above sea level,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://egsc.usgs.gov/isb//pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html |title=Elevations and Distances in the United States |author=U.S. Geological Survey |website=egsc.usgs.gov |access-date=November 22, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130122723/https://egsc.usgs.gov/isb//pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html |archive-date=November 30, 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> the lowest elevation point in the state is located near [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]] and the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.]]

Illinois has three major geographical divisions. [[Northern Illinois]] is dominated by [[Chicago metropolitan area]], or Chicagoland, which is the city of Chicago and its suburbs, and the adjoining exurban area into which the metropolis is expanding. As defined by the federal government, the Chicago metro area includes several counties in Illinois, [[Indiana]], and [[Wisconsin]], and has a population of over 9.8&nbsp;million. Chicago itself is a cosmopolitan city, densely populated, industrialized, the transportation hub of the nation, and settled by a wide variety of ethnic groups. The city of [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]], Illinois's third-largest city and center of the state's fourth largest metropolitan area, sits along Interstates [[Interstate 39|39]] and [[Interstate 90|90]] some {{cvt|75|mi|km}} northwest of Chicago. The [[Quad Cities]] region, located along the [[Mississippi River]] in northern Illinois, had a population of 381,342 in 2011.

The midsection of Illinois is the second major division, called [[Central Illinois]]. Historically [[prairie]], it is now mainly agricultural and known as the Heart of Illinois. It is characterized by small towns and medium–small cities. The western section (west of the Illinois River) was originally part of the [[Military Tract of 1812]] and forms the conspicuous western bulge of the state. Agriculture, particularly [[maize|corn]] and [[soybean]]s, as well as educational institutions and manufacturing centers, figure prominently in Central Illinois. Cities include [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]]; [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], the state capital; [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]]; [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]]; [[Bloomington-Normal, Illinois|Bloomington-Normal]]; and [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]]-[[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]].<ref name="Nelson"/>

The third division is [[Southern Illinois]], comprising the area south of [[U.S. Route 50 in Illinois|U.S. Route 50]], including [[Southern Illinois|Little Egypt]], near the juncture of the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Ohio River]]. Southern Illinois is the site of the ancient city of [[Cahokia]], as well as the site of the first state capital at [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], which today is separated from the rest of the state by the Mississippi River.<ref name="Nelson"/><ref name="Horsley">{{cite book |last=Horsley |first=A. Doyne |title=Illinois: A Geography |year=1986 |publisher=Westview Press |location=Boulder |isbn=978-0-86531-522-8}}</ref> This region has a somewhat warmer winter climate, different variety of crops (including some cotton farming in the past), more rugged topography (due to the area remaining unglaciated during the [[Illinoian (stage)|Illinoian Stage]], unlike most of the rest of the state), as well as small-scale oil deposits and coal mining. The Illinois suburbs of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], such as [[East St. Louis]], are located in this region, and collectively, they are known as the [[Metro-East]]. The other somewhat significant concentration of population in Southern Illinois is the Carbondale-Marion-Herrin, Illinois Combined Statistical Area centered on [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]] and [[Marion, Illinois|Marion]], a two-county area that is home to 123,272 residents.<ref name="Nelson"/> A portion of southeastern Illinois is part of the extended [[Evansville, Indiana]], Metro Area, locally referred to as the Tri-State with Indiana and Kentucky. Seven Illinois counties are in the area.

In addition to these three, largely latitudinally defined divisions, all of the region outside the Chicago metropolitan area is often called "[[Downstate Illinois|downstate]]" Illinois. This term is flexible, but is generally meant to mean everything outside the influence of the Chicago area. Thus, some cities in ''Northern'' Illinois, such as [[DeKalb, Illinois|DeKalb]], which is west of Chicago, and [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]]—which is actually north of Chicago—are sometimes incorrectly considered to be 'downstate'.

===Climate===

{{Main|Climate of Illinois|List of Illinois tornadoes}}
[[File:IL koppen.svg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] of Illinois]]

Illinois has a climate that varies widely throughout the year. Because of its nearly 400-mile distance between its northernmost and southernmost extremes, as well as its mid-continental situation, most of Illinois has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa''), with hot, humid summers and cold winters. The southern part of the state, from about [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]] southward, has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (Koppen ''Cfa''), with more moderate winters. Average yearly precipitation for Illinois varies from just over {{cvt|48|in|0}} at the southern tip to around {{cvt|35|in|0}} in the northern portion of the state. Normal annual snowfall exceeds {{cvt|38|in|0}} in the Chicago area, while the southern portion of the state normally receives less than {{cvt|14|in|0}}.<ref name="Climate_Maps">{{cite web |url=http://www.sws.uiuc.edu/atmos/statecli/index.htm |author=Illinois State Climatologist Office |title=Climate Maps |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207160607/http://www.sws.uiuc.edu/atmos/statecli/Mapsv2/mapsv2.htm |archive-date=February 7, 2006 |access-date=April 22, 2006}}</ref> The all-time high temperature was {{cvt|117|F|0}}, recorded on July 14, 1954, at [[East St. Louis, Illinois|East St. Louis]], and the all-time low temperature was {{cvt|−38|F|0}}, recorded on January 31, 2019, during the [[January 2019 North American cold wave]] at a weather station near [[Mount Carroll, Illinois|Mount Carroll]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/NWSLincoln/posts/2198866976801769  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/iarchive/facebook/201399873215166/2198866976801769 |archive-date=2022-02-26 |url-access=limited|title=US National Weather Service Central Illinois |website=Facebook |access-date=January 31, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name="SCEC">{{cite web |url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/records |title=State Climate Extremes Committee (SCEC) |website=National Centers for Environmental Information |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |access-date=April 30, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221174428/https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/records |archive-date=February 21, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> and confirmed on March 5, 2019.<ref name="SCECreport">{{cite web |url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-content/extremes/scec/reports/20190305-Illinois-Minimum-Temperature.pdf |title=Illinois State Record Minimum Temperature at Mt.

Illinois averages approximately 51 days of [[thunderstorm]] activity a year, which ranks somewhat above average in the number of thunderstorm days for the United States. Illinois is vulnerable to tornadoes, with an average of 35 occurring annually, which puts much of the state at around five tornadoes per {{cvt|10000|sqmi|km2|-4}} annually.<ref name="Annual average number of tornadoes">"[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif Annual average number of tornadoes, 1953–2004] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |date=October 16, 2011 }}", NOAA National Climatic Data Center.

====Christianity====
Roman Catholics constitute the single largest religious denomination in Illinois; they are heavily concentrated in and around Chicago and account for nearly 30% of the state's population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statemaster.com/red/graph/peo_rom_cat_per_of_cat-people-roman-catholicism-percentage-catholics&int=-1&id=IL |title=Roman Catholicism percentage of Catholics statistics—states compared—People data on StateMaster |publisher=Statemaster|date=May 15, 2012 |access-date=May 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120912213459/http://www.statemaster.com/red/graph/peo_rom_cat_per_of_cat-people-roman-catholicism-percentage-catholics&int=-1&id=IL |archive-date=September 12, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> However, taken together as a group, the various Protestant denominations comprise a greater percentage of the state's population than do Catholics. In 2010, Catholics in Illinois numbered 3,648,907. The largest Protestant denominations were the [[United Methodist Church]] with 314,461 members and the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] with 283,519. Illinois has one of the largest concentrations of [[Missouri Synod Lutherans]] in the United States.

Illinois played an important role in the early [[Latter Day Saint movement]], with Nauvoo becoming a gathering place for Mormons in the early 1840s. Nauvoo was the location of the [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]], which led to the separation of the Mormon movement into [[List of denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement|several Latter Day Saint sects]]. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the largest of the sects to emerge from the Mormon schism, has more than 55,000 adherents in Illinois today.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/facts-and-statistics/state/illinois |title=Illinois - Statistics and Church Facts |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210205040239/https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/facts-and-statistics/state/illinois |archive-date=February 5, 2021 |year=2020 |access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref>

By the early 2000s, Illinois's economy had moved toward a dependence on high-value-added services, such as financial trading, higher education, law, logistics, and medicine. In some cases, these services clustered around institutions that hearkened back to Illinois's earlier economies. For example, the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]], a trading exchange for global [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]], had begun its life as an agricultural [[futures exchange|futures market]]. Other important non-manufacturing industries include publishing, tourism, and energy production and distribution.

===Investments===
Venture capitalists funded a total of approximately $62&nbsp;billion in the U.S. economy in 2016. Of this amount, Illinois-based companies received approximately $1.1&nbsp;billion. Similarly, in FY 2016, the federal government spent $461&nbsp;billion on contracts in the U.S. Of this amount, Illinois-based companies received approximately $8.7&nbsp;billion.{{citation needed|date=April 2023}}

====Coal====

The coal industry of Illinois has its origins in the middle 19th century, when entrepreneurs such as [[Jacob Loose]] discovered coal in locations such as [[Sangamon County]]. [[Jacob Bunn]] contributed to the development of the Illinois coal industry and was a founder and owner of the [[Western Coal & Mining Company]] of Illinois. About 68% of Illinois has coal-bearing strata of the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] geologic period. According to the Illinois State Geological Survey, 211&nbsp;billion tons of [[bituminous coal]] are estimated to lie under the surface, having a total heating value greater than the estimated oil deposits in the [[Arabian Peninsula]].<ref>Illinois State Geological Survey.

{{Main|Government of Illinois}}
[[File:Gfp-illinois-springfield-capitol-and-sky.jpg |thumb|The [[Illinois State Capitol]] in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]]]]
The [[government of Illinois]], under the [[Constitution of Illinois]], has three branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. The executive branch is split into several statewide elected offices, with the governor as chief executive. Legislative functions are granted to the Illinois General Assembly. The judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court and lower courts.

The executive branch is composed of six elected officers and their offices as well as numerous other departments.<ref name=Lind2012ch5/> The six elected officers are:<ref name=Lind2012ch5/> [[Governor of Illinois|Governor]], [[Lieutenant Governor of Illinois|Lieutenant Governor]], [[Illinois Attorney General|Attorney General]], [[Illinois Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Illinois Comptroller|Comptroller]], and [[Illinois Treasurer|Treasurer]].

In [[2000 United States presidential election in Illinois|2000]], [[George W.

===History of corruption===

{{Main|Political corruption in Illinois}}

Politics in the state have been infamous for highly visible corruption cases, as well as for crusading reformers, such as governors [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] and [[James R. Thompson]]. In 2006, former governor [[George Ryan]] was convicted of racketeering and bribery, leading to a six-and-a-half-year prison sentence. On December 7, 2011, former governor [[Rod Blagojevich]] was sentenced to 14 years in prison for allegations that he conspired to sell the vacated Senate seat left by President [[Barack Obama]] to the highest bidder. Blagojevich had earlier been impeached and convicted by the legislature, resulting in his removal from office. In the late 20th century, Congressman [[Dan Rostenkowski]] was imprisoned for mail fraud; former governor and federal judge [[Otto Kerner, Jr.]] was imprisoned for bribery; Secretary of State [[Paul Powell (politician)|Paul Powell]] was investigated and found to have gained great wealth through bribes, and State Auditor of Public Accounts (Comptroller) [[Orville Hodge]] was imprisoned for embezzlement. In 1912, William Lorimer, the GOP boss of Chicago, was expelled from the U.S. Senate for bribery, and in 1921, Governor [[Len Small]] was found to have defrauded the state of a million dollars.<ref name="Biles"/><ref name="Horsley"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Grafters and Goo Goos: corruption and reform in Chicago, 1833–2003 |last=Merriner |first=James L. |year=2004 |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |location=Carbondale |isbn=978-0-8093-2571-9 |oclc=52720998}}</ref>

===U.S. presidential elections===

{{Main|United States presidential elections in Illinois}}

Illinois has shown a strong presence in presidential elections. Three presidents have claimed Illinois as their political base when running for president: [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], and most recently [[Barack Obama]]. Lincoln was born in [[Kentucky]], but he moved to Illinois at age 21. He served in the [[Illinois General Assembly|General Assembly]] and represented the [[Illinois's 7th congressional district|7th congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] before his election to the presidency in 1860. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was born in [[Ohio]] and had a military career that precluded settling down, but on the eve of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and approaching middle age, he moved to Illinois and thus utilized the state as his home and political base when running for president. [[Barack Obama]] was born in [[Hawaii]] and made Illinois his home after graduating from [[law school]], and later represented Illinois in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. He then became president in 2008, running as a candidate from his Illinois base.

[[Ronald Reagan]] was born in Illinois, in the city of [[Tampico, Illinois|Tampico]], raised in [[Dixon, Illinois]], and educated at [[Eureka College]], outside [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]]. Reagan later moved to [[California]] during his young adulthood. He then became an actor, and later became [[Governor of California|California's Governor]] before being elected president.

[[Hillary Clinton]] was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago and became the first woman to represent a major political party in the general election of the U.S. presidency. Clinton ran from a platform based in [[New York (state)|New York State]].

===African-American U.S. senators===

[[List of African-American United States Senators|Twelve African-Americans]] have served as members of the [[United States Senate]]. Of which three have represented Illinois, the most of any single state: [[Carol Moseley Braun|Carol Moseley-Braun]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.house.gov/People/Listing/M/MOSELEY-BRAUN,-Carol-(M001025)/ |title=Moseley Braun, Carol |website=History, Art & Archives |publisher=United States House of Representatives |access-date=October 6, 2020 |archive-date=October 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201003204047/https://history.house.gov/People/Listing/M/MOSELEY-BRAUN,-Carol-(M001025)/ |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Barack Obama]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/h_multi_sections_and_teasers/Photo_Exhibit_African_American_Senators.htm |title=U.S. Senate: Art & History Home |publisher=Senate.gov |access-date=February 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702035451/https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/h_multi_sections_and_teasers/Photo_Exhibit_African_American_Senators.htm |archive-date=July 2, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Roland Burris]], who was appointed to replace Obama after his election to the presidency. Moseley-Braun was the first African-American woman to become a U.S. Senator.

===Political families===

Three families from Illinois have played particularly prominent roles in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], gaining both statewide and national fame.

====Stevenson====

The [[Stevenson family]], initially rooted in central Illinois and later based in the Chicago metropolitan area, has provided four generations of Illinois officeholders.
*[[Adlai Stevenson I]] (1835–1914) was a Vice President of the United States, as well as a [[Congressman]]
*[[Lewis Stevenson (politician)|Lewis Stevenson]] (1868–1929), son of Adlai, served as [[Illinois Secretary of State]].
*[[Adlai Stevenson II]] (1900–1965), son of Lewis, served as [[Governor of Illinois]] and as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations; he was also the Democratic party's presidential nominee in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]], losing both elections to [[Dwight Eisenhower]].
*[[Adlai Stevenson III]] (1930–2021), son of Adlai II, served ten years as a [[United States Senator]].

====Daley====

The [[Daley family]]'s powerbase was in Chicago.
*[[Richard J. Daley]] (1902–1976) served as [[Mayor of Chicago]] from 1955 to his death.
*[[Richard M. Daley]] (born 1942), son of Richard J, was Chicago's longest-serving mayor, in office from 1989 to 2011.
*[[William M. Daley]] (born 1948), another son of Richard J, is a former [[White House Chief of Staff]] and has served in a variety of appointed positions.

====Pritzker====

The [[Pritzker family]] is based in Chicago and have played important roles in both the private and the public sectors.
*[[Jay Pritzker]] (1922–1999), co-founder of [[Hyatt Hotel]] based in Chicago.
*[[Penny Pritzker]] (born 1959), 38th [[United States Secretary of Commerce]] under President [[Barack Obama]].
*[[J. B. Pritzker]] (born 1965), current and 43rd [[governor of Illinois]] and co-founder of the Pritzker Group.

==Education==
[[File: Illini Union.jpg|thumb|The [[Illini Union]] at the [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign]]]]
[[File:Alex MacLean 2005 campus with cityscape.jpg|thumb|Campus of the [[University of Chicago]]]]

===Illinois State Board of education===
{{Main|Illinois State Board of Education}}

The Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) is autonomous of the governor and the state legislature, and administers [[public education]] in the state. Local municipalities and their respective [[school district]]s operate individual public schools, but the ISBE audits performance of public schools with the [[Illinois School Report Card]]. The ISBE also makes recommendations to state leaders concerning education spending and policies.

===Primary and secondary schools===
{{See also|List of school districts in Illinois|List of high schools in Illinois}}

Education is compulsory for ages 7–17 in Illinois. Schools are commonly, but not exclusively, divided into three tiers of primary and secondary education: elementary school, [[middle school]] or [[Middle school|junior high school]], and high school. District territories are often complex in structure. Many areas in the state are actually located in ''two'' school districts—one for high school and the other for elementary and middle schools. And such districts do not necessarily share boundaries. A given high school may have several elementary districts that feed into it, yet some of those feeder districts may themselves feed into multiple high school districts.

===Colleges and universities===
{{Main list|List of colleges and universities in Illinois}}
Using the criterion established by [[the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]], there are eleven "National Universities" in the state.

{{As of|2010|8|19}}, six of these rank in the "first tier" among the top 500 National Universities in the nation, as determined by the ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' rankings: the [[University of Chicago]], [[Northwestern University]], the [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign]], [[Loyola University Chicago]], the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], [[DePaul University]], [[University of Illinois Chicago]], [[Illinois State University]], [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]], and [[Northern Illinois University]].<ref name="usnews">{{cite web |url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-universities-rankings/state+IL |title=Best Colleges 2010—National Universities Rankings |date=August 19, 2009 |access-date=May 31, 2016 |website=[[U.S. News & World Report]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105090520/http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-universities-rankings/state+IL |archive-date=January 5, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> The University of Chicago is continuously ranked as one of the world's top ten universities on various independent university rankings, and its [[Booth School of Business]], along with Northwestern's [[Kellogg School of Management]] consistently rank within the top five graduate business schools in the country and top ten globally. The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is often ranked among the best engineering schools in the world and United States.

Illinois also has more than twenty additional [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] four-year universities, both public and private, and dozens of small [[liberal arts college]]s across the state. Additionally, Illinois supports 49 public [[community college]]s in the [[Illinois Community College System]].

===School financing===
Schools in Illinois are funded primarily by property taxes, based on state assessment of property values, rather than direct state contributions. Scholar Tracy Steffes has described Illinois public education as historically "inequitable", a system where one of "the wealthiest of states" is "the stingiest in its support for education". There have been several attempts to reform school funding in Illinois. The most notable attempt came in 1973 with the adoption of the Illinois Resource Equalizer Formula, a measure through which it was hoped funding could be collected and distributed to Illinois schools more equitably. However, opposition from affluent Illinois communities who objected to having to pay for the less well-off school districts (many of them Black majority communities, produced by redlining, white flight, and other "soft" segregation methods) resulted in the formula's abolition in the late 1980s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Steffes |first1=Tracy L. |title=Assessment Matters: The Rise and Fall of the Illinois Resource Equalizer Formula |journal=History of Education Quarterly |date=February 2020 |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=24–57 |doi=10.1017/heq.2020.7 |s2cid=216496825}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
{{See also|List of Illinois Routes}}
Because of its central location and its proximity to the [[Rust Belt]] and [[Grain Belt]], Illinois is a national crossroads for air, auto, rail, and truck traffic.

====Airports====
{{See also|List of airports in Illinois}}
[[File:Concourse B, Chicago O'Hare airport.jpg|thumb|Concourse B inside [[O'Hare International Airport]], one of the [[List of busiest airports by passenger traffic|world's busiest airports]]]]

From 1962 until 1998, Chicago's [[O'Hare International Airport]] (ORD) was the busiest airport in the world, measured both in terms of total flights and passengers. While it was surpassed by [[Atlanta]]'s [[Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Hartsfield]] in 1998 (as Chicago splits its air traffic between O'Hare and Midway airports, while Atlanta uses only one airport), with 59.3&nbsp;million domestic passengers annually, along with 11.4&nbsp;million international passengers in 2008,<ref>{{cite web |title=O'Hare International Airport Activity Statistics |url=http://www.flychicago.com/Statistics/stats/1208ORDSUMMARY-REVISED.pdf |publisher=City of Chicago: FlyChicago.com |date=March 27, 2009 |access-date=April 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101054630/http://flychicago.com/Statistics/stats/1208ORDSUMMARY-REVISED.pdf |archive-date=January 1, 2010 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> O'Hare consistently remains one of the two or three busiest airports globally, and in some years still ranks number one in total flights. It is a major [[airline hub|hub]] for both [[United Airlines]] and [[American Airlines]], and a major airport expansion project is currently underway. [[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway Airport]] (MDW), which had been the busiest airport in the world at one point until it was supplanted by O'Hare as the busiest airport in 1962, is now the secondary airport in the Chicago metropolitan area and still ranks as one of the nation's busiest airports. Midway is a major hub for [[Southwest Airlines]] and services many other carriers as well. Midway served 17.3&nbsp;million domestic and international passengers in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |title=Midway Airport Activity Statistics |url=http://www.flychicago.com/Statistics/stats/1208SUMMARYRevised.pdf |website=FlyChicago.com |publisher=City of Chicago |date=January 30, 2009 |access-date=April 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101054737/http://flychicago.com/Statistics/stats/1208SUMMARYRevised.pdf |archive-date=January 1, 2010}}</ref>

====Rail====
{{See also|List of Illinois railroads}}
[[File:Wikipedia Map Final Draft.pdf|thumb|Illinois major rail network]]

Illinois has an extensive passenger and freight rail transportation network. Chicago is a national [[Amtrak]] hub and in-state passengers are served by Amtrak's [[Illinois Service]], featuring the Chicago to Carbondale [[Illini (Amtrak)|''Illini'']] and [[Saluki (Amtrak)|''Saluki'']], the Chicago to Quincy [[Illinois Zephyr and Carl Sandburg|''Carl Sandburg'']] and ''[[Illinois Zephyr and Carl Sandburg|Illinois Zephyr]]'', and the Chicago to St. Louis ''[[Lincoln Service]]''. Currently there is trackwork on the Chicago–St. Louis line to bring the maximum speed up to {{cvt|110|mph}}, which would reduce the trip time by an hour and a half. Nearly every North American railway meets at Chicago, making it the largest and most active rail hub in the country. Extensive heavy rail service is provided in the city proper and some immediate suburbs by the [[Chicago Transit Authority]]'s [[Chicago "L"|'L']] system. One of the largest suburban commuter rail system in the United States, operated by [[Metra]], uses existing rail lines to provide direct commuter rail access for hundreds of suburbs to the city and beyond.

====Waterways====
{{See also|Category:Illinois waterways}}
In addition to the state's rail lines, the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Illinois River]] provide major transportation routes for the state's agricultural interests. [[Lake Michigan]] gives Illinois access to the Atlantic Ocean by way of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]].

====Interstate highway system====
{{Main|List of Interstate Highways in Illinois}}
