'''{{Audio|Fu2qing1.ogg|Fuqing}}''' ({{zh|s=福清|p=Fúqīng|w=Fu<sup>2</sup>-ch'ing<sup>1</sup>|poj=Hok-chhiaⁿ}}; [[Foochow Romanized]]: Hók-chiăng; also romanized as Hokchia) is a [[county-level city]] of [[Fujian|Fujian Province]], [[China]], it is under the administration of the [[prefecture-level city]] of [[Fuzhou]].

==Geography==
[[File:Fuqing Longjiang Qiao 20120303-04.jpg|thumb|left|The Lóng River Bridge near the [[river mouth]] of the [[Long River (Fujian)|eponymous river]] in [[Haikou, Fujian|Haikou]], dating from the [[Song dynasty]].]]
Fuqing is located on the north-central section of the coast of Fujian, south of the urban area of [[Fuzhou]] and north of [[Putian]]. It is the southernmost administrative division of Fuzhou on the mainland and is the only [[county-level city]] under the administration of Fuzhou. To the northwest of Fuqing lies [[Yongtai County]], on its northern border is [[Minhou County]], and to its northeast is [[Changle, Fuzhou|the district of Changle]]. The entire southwestern land border is shared with [[Hanjiang, Putian]]. The territory of Fuqing also includes over 100 islands,<ref name="Caldwell_1953_quote1"/> and is connected by road to the major islands of [[Pingtan County]].

The highest point of Fuqing is Guya Peak ({{lang-zh|c=古崖山尾|p=Gǔyá Shānwěi}}), which is situated on its border with [[Minhou County]] to the north, and has a height of {{convert|1003|m|ft}} above sea level. The northern part of the county-level city is situated in the valley of the [[Long River (Fujian)|Long]] River ({{lang-zh|s=龙江|t=龍江|p=Lóngjiāng|tr=Dragon River}}), which includes the city's central urban area. 

Fuqing has a long indented coastline on the [[Taiwan Strait]], mostly consisting of rocky shores. A prominent part of its territory is the Longgao Peninsula ({{lang-zh|s=龙高半岛|t=龍高半島|p=Lóng-Gāo Bàndǎo|labels=no}}),<ref>{{cite web|title=福清龙高半岛地区发现富水地段 |url=https://zrzyt.fujian.gov.cn/zwgk/xwdt/tpxw/201401/t20140113_665418.htm |website=福建省自然资源厅 |publisher=海峡资源报 |date=2014-01-13|language=zh}}</ref> named for two of its major towns, [[Longtian, Fujian|Longtian]] and [[Gaoshan, Fujian|Gaoshan]].<ref>{{cite web|title=福清福庐山：矿坑蝶变生态公园 |url=https://zrzyt.fujian.gov.cn/zwgk/xwdt/zrzyyw/202310/t20231016_6273436.htm |website=福建省自然资源厅 |access-date=12 December 2023 |language=zh}}</ref> This peninsula also forms two major bays: Fuqing Bay  ({{lang-zh|s=福清湾|t=福清灣|p=Fúqīng Wān|labels=no}}) to its north, and Xinghua Bay ({{lang-zh|s=兴化湾|t=興化灣|p=Xīnghuà Wān|labels=no}}) to its south. The jagged coastline has given rise to a multitude of harbors and ports, including [[Haikou, Fujian|Haikou]], situated at the [[river mouth|mouth]] of the [[Long River (Fujian)|Lóng]].<ref name="Caldwell_1953_quote1">{{cite book |last1=Caldwell |first1=John Cope |title=China Coast Family |date=1953 |publisher=H.

==Overseas Fuqing==
Fuqing, as well as most of the rest of [[Fujianese people|Fujian]], is known for its large number of emigrants, or ''[[Overseas Chinese|huaqiao]]''. The first wave of emigration<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.theasiamag.com/archives/2007/the-fuqing-connection |title=The Fuqing connection &#124; asia!

Some became among the richest men in Southeast Asia, e.g. [[Sudono Salim]] (Salim Group), [[Hendra Rahardja]], [[Rachman Halim]] (Gudang Garam), Henry Kwee Hian Liong (Pontiac Land Group).

Overseas Fuqingese assembled into associations for mutual support, including the [http://www.iafqc.com/sc/pages.php?pid=7 International Association of Fuqing], [[Perkumpulan Fuqing]] (Indonesia), and Singapore Futsing Association.

==Local dialect==
{{Main|Fuqing dialect}}
[[File:Fuqing Ruiyun Ta 20120303-23.jpg|thumb|right|Guardian figures, [[Ruiyun Pagoda]] ([[:zh:瑞云塔]]). Late [[Ming Dynasty]]]]
Fuqing has its own dialect ({{lang-zh|s=福清话|t=福清話|p=Fúqīnghuà}}, [[Bàng-uâ-cê]]: ''Hók-chiăng-uâ'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] in the local dialect: /{{IPA|huʔ˥ tsʰiaŋ˥ ŋuɑ˦˨}}/), classified as part of the Houguan branch of [[Eastern Min]]. It is closely related to the [[Fuzhou dialect]], and the two are mutually intelligible to quite a high extent, although not completely.<ref name="Norman_1977">{{cite journal |last1=Norman |first1=Jerry |title=A Preliminary Report on the Dialects of Mintung |journal=Monumenta Serica |date=1977 |volume=33 |pages=326–348 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40726246 |access-date=12 December 2023 |issn=0254-9948 |quote=The natives consider most of the dialects of the area mutually intelligible and commonly speak to one another, each using his own local form of  speech. It was my impression, however, that the differences among the dialects which I had a chance to record are considerable and that unpracticed speakers from peripheral areas might have some difficulty in communicating with one another.}}</ref><ref name="Inoue_2018">{{cite journal |last1=Inoue |first1=Fumio |title=Continuum of Fujian language boundary perception: dialect division and dialect image |journal=Dialectologia: revista electrònica |date=2018 |pages=147–180 |url=https://raco.cat/index.php/Dialectologia/article/view/334699/425530 |access-date=12 December 2023 |issn=2013-2247|quote=[M]ost of the students marked a restricted area, including only Fuzhou and Fuqing. Most responses had diameters between 200 and 300 kilometers.}}</ref> Due to the hilly terrain and the isolation between villages, there is a large amount of dialectal variation.<ref name="Fuqing Fangyan Yanjiu">{{cite book |last1=Feng |first1=Aizhen 馮愛珍 |title=《福清方言研究》 Fuqing Fangyan Yanjiu |date=1993 |publisher=社會科學文獻出版社 |location=Beijing |isbn=7800503909}}</ref>
Songs sung in Fuqing dialect are available online.{{cn|date=December 2023}}

Most of its people can also speak [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]],{{cn|date=December 2023}} which is used in schools, businesses, and to communicate with people from different parts of the province. 

There are also scattered villages that speak predominantly [[Southern Min]] varieties, with their populations coming from the [[Jinjiang, Quanzhou|Jinjiang]], [[Zhangpu County|Zhangpu]] and [[Hui'an County|Hui'an]], among other areas of southern Fujian.<ref name="Fuqing Fangyan Yanjiu" />  However, their dialects have diverged significantly from the mainstream [[Hokkien]] varieties, such as in the use of /{{IPAlink|y}}/ as a phoneme, and the use of vocabulary items closer to that of the Eastern Min varieties, such as {{wikt-lang|zh|俊}} (BUC: ''cóng'', IPA: /{{IPA|tsoŋ}}/) instead of {{wikt-lang|zh|媠}} ([[Pe̍h-ōe-jī|POJ]]: ''súi'') for "beautiful, good-looking".<ref name="Fuqing Fangyan Yanjiu" /> 

In addition, there are villages that speak a form of [[Putian dialect]], mostly near the border with Putian, with the distinctive use of /{{IPAlink|ɬ}}/ instead of /{{IPA|s}}/ or /{{IPA|θ}}/ more common in the Fuqing dialect.<ref name="Fuqing Fangyan Yanjiu" />

==Regional foods==
Fuqing is located in the coastal hills, subtropical climate, warm and rainy, but the river is short and shallow. Rich in species while not rich in harvest. Therefore, the important staple food in Fuqing is sweet potato. Non-staple food is dominated by various marine food.

'''[[Kompyang|Guangbing]]''' ({{lang|zh-hans|光饼}}): Guangbing is a bread product that is baked and shaped like a sesame-seeded burger bun top. In 1562, the Japanese invaded Fujian province. General [[Qi Jiguang]] was charged to drive the invaders out of Fujian. In order not to let the meal time slow down their marching speed, General&nbsp;Qi invented a kind of bread which was shaped into a ring at that time, so his soldiers could wear a string of those breads around their neck. After the victory, the recipe of this bread product was spread throughout the province and named Guangbing after General&nbsp;Qi. Nowadays, there is no longer a hole in the center of a Guangbing, and there are various kinds of Guangbing developed in different areas in Fujian province, which don’t look the same. Fuqing Guangbing is made of the flour, sugar and salt which are all locally produced, as well as the excellent Fuqing sesame seeds, which are very big and taste better than ordinary small sesame seeds. Guangbing was handed down by people to commemorate Qi Jiguang's achievements, which has been used and developed to this day. The people of Fuqing not only passed down the making method of Guangbing, but also passed down the culture to make ritual offerings, Guangbing, to their ancestors.

==Festival and special customs==
Fuqing has some special customs different from other areas in China, which reflects the local history and culture. Fuqing customs have four obvious influences:
 
(1) the legacy of ancient Yue;
(2) ancient Central Plains culture; 
(3) religion, especially Buddhism and Taoism; 
(4) in modern times, foreign culture

=== Spring Festival ===
Unlike other areas of China, the top part of the couplets traditionally put up during the [[Chinese New Year]] are white, not red. It is said that in 1562 on New Year's Eve, when the Japanese invaded Fuqing, people had to escape shortly after putting up the Spring Festival couplets. Upon returning after General Qi Jiguang's victory, people changed the couplets from red, which represents joy and celebration, into green or added white on the top to mourn for their family and friends who had died in the conflict.<ref name="FQ_Customs">{{cite web |url=http://www.fqqxb.com/Article/mswh/200901/181.html |title=福清春节习俗 |website=Fqqxb.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204114528/http://www.fqqxb.com/Article/mswh/200901/181.html |archive-date=2017-12-04}}</ref>

On the first day of the new year, people in Fuqing like many across the Eastern Fujian region commonly eat [[misua|xianmian]] ({{lang-zh|s=线面|p=xiànmiàn}}), an extra-thin wheat noodle, with the addition of two duck eggs to represent longevity. In the local language, the term for "duck egg" ({{lang-zh|s=鸭卵}}, [[Bàng-uâ-cê|BUC]]: ''ák-lâung'') has a pronunciation similar or the same as that of "suppress chaos" ({{lang-zh|s=压乱}}, [[Bàng-uâ-cê|BUC]]: ''ák-lâung''); thus the eggs represent peace and stability.<ref name="Fujian_Qifu">{{cite web |title=闽台传统祈福纳祥文化的主要内涵（上）_福州档案信息网 |url=https://daj.fuzhou.gov.cn/zz/wszt/tslm/msfq/202302/t20230213_4536599.htm |website=daj.fuzhou.gov.cn |access-date=7 May 2024 |date=13 February 2023}}</ref> The dish is often given the name 'peace noodles' ({{lang-zh|s=太平面|p=tàipíng miàn}}). A similar combination is also commonly eaten on birthdays, where it is dubbed 'longevity noodles' ({{lang-zh|s=长寿面|p=chángshòu miàn}}).

The second day of the new year is the day to visit and comfort the family that have lost their family members in the previous year ({{lang-zh|s=拜初二|p=bài chū'èr}}, alternatively in {{lang-zh|s=拜新座|p=bài xīnzuò}}). On that day, people thus avoid visiting families where nobody died in the previous year, regarding such a visit as unlucky.<ref name="FQ_Customs" /><ref>{{cite web |title=福清初二不能拜年，那就在家烰嗲饼吧！ |url=https://www.sohu.com/a/58426066_349454 |website=www.sohu.com |access-date=7 May 2024}}</ref>

=== Lantern Festival ===
The main customs of the [[Lantern Festival]] include eating yuanxiao, dragon and lion dance, Shehuo, lantern riddles, stilt, boat, row, and walking on the Li Bridge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tech-food.com/kndata/detail/k0195406.htm|title=福清元宵节习俗_中国习俗_习俗文化_食品科技网|website=Tech-food.com|access-date=27 June 2022}}</ref>

=== Winter Solstice Festival ===
The most important part of the winter solstice festival is making glutinous rice balls and preparing the red-orange and ten pairs of chopsticks. The red-orange stands for blessing and the ten pairs of chopsticks stand for family reunion. People also light a pair of red candles to represent prosperity.<ref>[http://www.sohu.com/a/122173019_482304] {{Dead link|date=February 2022}}</ref>

=== Tomb-sweeping Day ===
The essential part of the [[Qingming Festival]] is to offer sacrifices that are often made from paper, as well as fire incense and firecrackers in front of the tomb. After sweeping the tomb, people take some pine branches or flowers back home for good luck.
