Leicester has a long history extending into ancient times, it was the site of the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] town of [[Ratae Corieltauvorum]], which was later captured by the [[Anglo-Saxon]]s, and then by the [[Vikings]] who made it one of the [[Five Boroughs of the Danelaw]]. Leicester became an important town during the [[Middle Ages]], and then an important industrial and commercial centre in the [[Victorian era|Victorian age]], eventually gaining [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 1919. Since the mid-20th century, immigration from countries of the [[British Commonwealth]] has seen Leicester become an ethnically diverse city, and one of the largest urban centres of the [[Midlands]].

Leicester is at the intersection of two railway lines: the [[Midland Main Line]] and the [[Birmingham]] to [[London Stansted Airport]] line. It is also at the confluence of the [[M1 motorway|M1]]/[[M69 motorway]]s and the [[A6 road (England)|A6]]/[[A46 road (England)|A46]] trunk routes. [[Leicester Cathedral]] is home to the [[Leicester Cathedral#Tomb of Richard III|tomb]] of [[Richard III of England|King Richard III]] who was reburied in the cathedral in 2015 after [[exhumation and reburial of Richard III of England|being discovered]] nearby in the foundations of the lost [[Greyfriars, Leicester|Greyfriars]] chapel, more than 500 years after his death. In sporting terms, Leicester is the home to [[Association football|football]] club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and [[Rugby Union|rugby]] club [[Leicester Tigers]].

==Name==
The name of Leicester comes from [[Old English]]. It is first recorded in Latinised form in the early ninth century as ''Legorensis civitatis'' and in Old English itself in an ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' entry for 924 as ''{{lang|ang|Ligera ceastre}}'' (and, in various spellings, frequently thereafter). In the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of 1086, it is recorded as ''{{lang|ang|Ledecestre}}''.<ref name="dictionary">''The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names Based on the Collections of the English Place-Name Society'', ed. by Victor Watts (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), s.v. ''LEICESTER'', ''LEIRE''.</ref>

The first element of the name is the name of a people, the ''Ligore'' (whose name appears in ''Ligera ceastre'' in the [[Genitive case|genitive]] plural form); their name came in turn from the river Ligor (now the [[River Soar]]), the origin of whose name is uncertain but thought to be from [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] (possibly cognate with the name of the [[Loire]]).<ref name="dictionary" /><ref name="Stevenson1918">{{cite journal |last=Stevenson |first=W. H. |date=1918 |title=A note on the derivation of the name 'Leicester' |journal=The Archaeological Journal |publisher=Royal Archaeological Institute (London) |volume=75 |pages=30&nbsp;f}} {{cite magazine |last=Dudley |first=John |date=1848 |title=Etymology of the Name of Leicester |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qvwRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA580 |magazine=The Gentleman's Magazine |volume=184 |pages=580–582}} citing Wilford, ''Asiatick Researches'' vol. ii. No. 2 (1812), [https://books.google.com/books?id=1N5YAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA45 p. 45]:
"The learned Somner says that the river which runs by it [Leicester] was formerly called Leir by the same contraction [from Legora], and it is probably the river Liar of the anonymous geographer. Mr. Somner, if I be not mistaken, places the original own of ''Ligora'' near the source of the Lear, now the Soar".</ref><ref>

Leicester is one of the oldest cities in England, with a history going back at least two millennia.<ref>W. G.

This area of the Soar was split into two channels: a main stream to the east and a narrower channel on the west, with a presumably marshy island between. The settlement seems to have controlled a ford across the larger channel. The [[Ratae Corieltauvorum#Name|later Roman name]] was a [[Latinization of names|latinate]] form of the [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] word for "ramparts" (cf. [[Irish Gaelic|Gaelic]] ''[[Ringfort|rath]]'' and the nearby villages of [[Ratby]] and [[Ratcliffe-upon-Soar|Ratcliffe]]<ref name=tommyA/>), suggesting the site was an [[oppidum]].

It remains unclear whether the Romans fortified and garrisoned the location, but it slowly developed from around the year 50 onwards as the [[civitas|tribal capital]] of the Corieltauvians under the name [[Ratae Corieltauvorum]].

Knowledge of the town following the [[Roman withdrawal from Britain]] is limited. It seems to have been continually occupied after Roman protection ceased through the 5th and 6th centuries, although with a significantly reduced population. Its memory was preserved as the ''{{nowrap|Cair Lerion}}''<ref name=mommy>[[Nennius]] ({{abbr|attrib.|Traditional attribution}}).

Following the [[Norman Conquest|Norman conquest]], Leicester was recorded by [[William I of England|William]]'s [[Domesday Book]] as ''Ledecestre''. It was noted as a city (''civitas'') but lost this status in the 11th century owing to power struggles between the [[Catholic Church in England|Church]] and the [[aristocracy]]{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} and did not become a legal city again until 1919.

During the 14th century, the earls of Leicester and Lancaster enhanced the prestige of the town. [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster]] and of Leicester founded a hospital for the poor and infirm in the area to the south of the castle now known as The Newarke (the "new work"). Henry's son, the great [[Henry of Grosmont]], 4th Earl of Lancaster and of Leicester, who was made first Duke of Lancaster, enlarged and enhanced his father's foundation, and built the collegiate Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady of The Newarke.<ref>Charles James Billson, ''Mediaeval Leicester'' (Leicester, 1920)</ref> This church (a little of which survives in the basement of the Hawthorn Building of De Montfort University) was destroyed during the reign of King Edward VI. It became an important pilgrimage site because it housed a thorn said to be from the Crown of Thorns, given to the Duke by the King of France. The church (described by Leland in the C16th as "not large but exceeding fair") also became, effectively, a Lancastrian mausoleum. Duke Henry's daughter [[Blanche of Lancaster]] married [[John of Gaunt]] and their son Henry Bolingbroke became [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]] when he deposed King Richard II. The Church of the Annunciation was the burial place of Duke Henry, who had earlier had his father re-interred here. Later it became the burial place of [[Constance of Castile, Duchess of Lancaster]] (second wife of John of Gaunt) and of [[Mary de Bohun]], first wife of Henry Bolingbroke (Henry IV) and mother of King Henry V (she did not become queen because she died before Bolingbroke became king). John of Gaunt died at Leicester Castle in 1399. When his son became king, the Earldom of Leicester and the Duchy of Lancaster became royal titles (and the latter remains so).

On 4 November 1530, [[Cardinal Thomas Wolsey]] was arrested on charges of treason and taken from Yorkshire. On his way south to face dubious justice at the [[Tower of London]], he fell ill. The group escorting him was concerned enough to stop at Leicester to rest at Leicester Abbey. There, Wolsey's condition quickly worsened. He died on 29 November 1530 and was buried at [[Leicester Abbey]], now [[Abbey Park, Leicestershire|Abbey Park]].

[[Lady Jane Grey]], who claimed the English throne for nine days in June 1553, was born at [[Bradgate Park]] near Leicester around 1536.<ref name="royweb">{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page44.asp |title=Official Website of the British Monarchy – Jane |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501194655/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page44.asp |archive-date=1 May 2015}}</ref>

Queen [[Elizabeth I]]'s intimate and former suitor, [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]], was given the [[Earldom of Leicester]].

After the [[Union of the Crowns]], [[Anne of Denmark]], [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]], and [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|Princess Elizabeth]] travelled to Leicester on 24 June 1603, after the courtier and usher Thomas Conway was assured that the town was free from infection or plague.<ref>William Kelly, ''Royal Progresses to Leicester'' (Leicester, 1855), pp. 8–9.</ref> [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles, later King Charles I]], travelled to London with his guardian [[Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline|Alexander Seton]].

The Corporation of Leicester opposed the efforts of Charles I to disafforest the nearby [[Leicester Forest]], believing them to be likely to throw many of its residents into poverty and need of relief. [[Miles Fleetwood|Sir Miles Fleetwood]] was sent to commission the disafforestation and division of lands being used in common.<ref>{{Citation |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-03681-6 |location=Berkeley |title=In contempt of all authority |author=Buchanan Sharp |date=1980 |id=0520036816 |ol=4742314M}}p70-71</ref> Riots destroyed enclosures in spring 1627 and 1628, following a pattern of [[Western Rising and disafforestation riots|anti-enclosure disturbances]] found elsewhere including the Western Rising.<ref>Sharp, p58-59</ref>

Petitions challenging the enclosures were presented by the Corporation of Leicester and borough residents to the King and [[Privy Council]]. They were unsuccessful so petitioned the [[House of Lords]] in June 1628 who however supported Fleetwood but asked for proceedings made by the Crown against the rioters to be dropped. Compensation made to the legal residents of the forest was reasonably generous by comparison with other forests. The Corporation of Leicester received {{cvt|40|acres|0|abbr=on}} for relief of the poor.<ref>Sharp, p88</ref>

====Civil War====
Leicester was a Parliamentarian (colloquially called [[Roundhead]]) stronghold during the [[English Civil War]]. In 1645, King [[Charles I of England]] and [[Prince Rupert]] decided to attack the (then) town to draw the [[New Model Army]] away from the Royalist (colloquially called [[Cavaliers]]) headquarters of [[Oxford]]. [[Royalist]] guns were set up on [[Raw Dykes]] and, after an unsatisfactory response to a demand for surrender, the assault began at 3pm on 30 May 1645 by a Royalist battery opposite the Newarke. The town – which only had approximately 2,000 defenders opposed to the Royalist Army of approximately 10,000 combatants – was sacked on 31 May 1645, and hundreds of people were killed by Rupert's cavalry. One witness said, "they fired upon our men out of their windows, from the tops of houses, and threw tiles upon their heads. Finding one house better manned than ordinary, and many shots fired at us out of the windows, I caused my men to attack it, and resolved to make them an example for the rest; which they did. Breaking open the doors, they killed all they found there without distinction". It was reported that 120 houses had been destroyed and that 140 wagons of plunder were sent to the Royalist stronghold of [[Newark-on-Trent|Newark]].

Following the Parliamentarian victory over the Royalist Army at the [[Battle of Naseby]] on 14 June 1645 Leicester was recovered by Parliament on 18 June 1645.

The construction of the [[Grand Union Canal]] in the 1790s linked Leicester to London and [[Birmingham]]. The first railway station in Leicester opened in 1832, in the form of the [[Leicester and Swannington Railway]] which provided a supply of coal to the town from nearby collieries.{{sfn|Butt|1995|p=141}}<ref>{{Cite book |title=Victorian Leicester |last=Elliott |first=Malcolm |publisher=Phillimore |year=1979 |isbn=0-85033-327-X |location=London and Chichester |pages=26}}</ref> The [[Midland Counties Railway]] (running from [[Derby railway station|Derby]] to [[Rugby railway station|Rugby]]) linked the town to the national network by 1840. A direct link to [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras]] was established by the [[Midland Railway]] in the 1860s. These developments encouraged and accompanied a [[Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdom|process of industrialisation]] which intensified throughout the reign of [[Queen Victoria]]. Factories began to appear, particularly along the canal and river, and districts such as [[Frog Island, Leicester|Frog Island]] and [[Woodgate, Leicestershire|Woodgate]] were the locations of numerous large mills. Between 1861 and 1901, Leicester's population increased from {{nowrap|68,100}} to {{nowrap|211,600}} {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}and the proportion employed in trade, commerce, building, and the city's new factories and workshops rose steadily. [[Hosiery]], textiles, and footwear became the major industrial employers: manufacturers such as [[N. Corah & Sons]] and the Cooperative Boot and Shoe Company were opening some of the largest manufacturing premises in Europe. They were joined, in the latter part of the century, by engineering firms such as Kent Street's Taylor and Hubbard (crane makers and founders{{clarify|date=December 2014}}), Vulcan Road's [[Gimson and Company|William Gimson & Company]] (steam boilers and founders), and Martin Street's Richards & Company (steel works and founders).

The politics of Victorian Leicester were lively and very often bitter. Years of consistent economic growth meant living standards generally increased, but Leicester was a stronghold of [[Radicals (UK)|Radicalism]]. [[Thomas Cooper (poet)|Thomas Cooper]], the [[Chartism|Chartist]], kept a shop in Church Gate. There were serious Chartist riots in the town in 1842 and again six years later.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyhome.co.uk/peel/chartism/leicchar.htm |website=A Web of English History |publisher=Dr Marjie Bloy |title=Chartism in Leicestershire |access-date=23 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115108/http://www.historyhome.co.uk/peel/chartism/leicchar.htm |archive-date=26 August 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[Leicester Secular Society]] was founded in 1851 but [[secularism|secularist]] speakers such as [[George Holyoake]] were often denied the use of speaking halls. It was not until 1881 that [[Leicester Secular Hall]] was opened. The second half of the 19th century also witnessed the creation of many other institutions, including the town council, [[Leicester Royal Infirmary|the Royal Infirmary]], and the Leicester Constabulary. It also benefited from general acceptance (and the Public Health Acts ){{citation needed|date=February 2016}} that municipal organisations had a responsibility to provide for the town's water supply, drainage, and sanitation. In 1853, backed with a guarantee of dividends by the Corporation of Leicester the Leicester Waterworks Company built a reservoir at Thornton for the supply of water to the town. This guarantee was made possible by the Public Health Act 1847 and an amending local Act of Parliament of 1851. In 1866 another amending Act enabled the Corporation of Leicester to take shares in the company to enable another reservoir at Cropston, completed in 1870. The Corporation of Leicester was later able to buy the waterworks and build another reservoir at Swithland, completed in the 1890s.<ref>Elliott, Malcolm.op cit pages 62 -64 and 124–135</ref>

Leicester became a [[county borough]] in 1889, although it was abolished in 1974 as part of the [[Local Government Act 1972|Local Government Act]], and was reformed as a non-metropolitan district and city. The city regained its unitary status, being administered separately from Leicestershire, in 1997. The borough had been expanding throughout the 19th century, but grew most notably when it annexed [[Belgrave, Leicestershire|Belgrave]], [[Aylestone]], [[North Evington]], [[Knighton, Leicestershire|Knighton]], and [[Stoneygate]] in 1892.

====Early 20th century====
[[File:Clock Tower and Eastgates c1910.jpg|thumb|Edwardian city centre]]
In 1900, the [[Great Central Railway]] provided another link to London, but the rapid population growth of the previous decades had already begun to slow by the time of Queen Victoria's death in 1901.
[[World War I]] and the subsequent epidemics had further impacts. Nonetheless, Leicester was finally recognised as a legal city once more in 1919 in recognition of its contribution to the British war effort. Recruitment to the armed forces was lower in Leicester than in other English cities, partly because of the low level of unemployment and the need for many of its industries, such as clothing and footwear manufacturing, to supply the army. As the war progressed, many of Leicester's factories were given over to arms production; Leicester produced the first batch of Howitzer shells by a British company which was not making ammunition before the war. After the war, the city received a royal visit; the king and queen received a march-past in [[Victoria Park, Leicester|Victoria Park]] of thousands of serving and demobilised soldiers. Following the end of the war, a memorial arch—the [[Arch of Remembrance]]—was built in Victoria Park and unveiled in 1925. The arch, one of the largest First World War memorials in the UK, was designed by [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]], who also designed [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall|the Cenotaph]] in London and is a grade I [[listed building]]. A set of gates and lodges, again by Lutyens, were added in the 1930s, leading to the memorial from the University Road and London Road entrances to Victoria Park.<ref>Richardson, p. 63.</ref><ref>Beazley, pp. 174–175.</ref><ref>{{NHLE|num=1074786|desc=The Arch of Remembrance|access-date=28 May 2018}}</ref>
[[File:Leicester Arch of Remembrance (front, 07) cropped.jpg|thumb|The [[Arch of Remembrance]] in [[Victoria Park, Leicester|Victoria Park]]]]
In 1927, Leicester again became a cathedral city on the consecration of {{nowrap|St Martin's}} Church as the cathedral. A second major extension to the boundaries following the changes in 1892 took place in 1935, with the annexation of the remainder of [[Evington]], [[Humberstone, Leicestershire|Humberstone]], [[Beaumont Leys]], and part of [[Braunstone Park & Rowley Fields|Braunstone]]. A third major revision of the boundaries took place in 1966, with the net addition to the city of just over {{cvt|450|acres|0|abbr=on}}. The boundary has remained unchanged since that time.

Leicester's diversified economic base and lack of dependence on primary industries meant it was much better placed than many other cities to weather the tariff wars of the 1920s and [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s. The Bureau of Statistics of the newly formed [[League of Nations]] identified Leicester in 1936 as the second-richest city in Europe<ref>{{cite book |last1=William |first1=David |title=UK Cities: A Look at Life and Major Cities in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland |date=13 October 2010 |publisher=New Africa Press |isbn=978-9987160211 |page=127}}</ref> and it became an attractive destination for refugees fleeing persecution and political turmoil in [[continental Europe]]. Firms such as Corah and Liberty Shoes used their reputation for producing high-quality products to expand their businesses. These years witnessed the growth in the city of [[trade unionism]] and particularly the [[co-operative movement]]. The Co-op became an important employer and landowner; when Leicester played host to the [[Jarrow March]] on its way to London in 1936, the Co-op provided the marchers with a change of boots. In 1938, Leicester was selected as the base for Squadron 1F, the first A.D.C.C (Air Defence Cadet Corp), the predecessor of the [[Air Training Corps]].

====World War II====
Leicester was bombed on 19 November 1940. Although only three bombs hit the city, 108 people were killed in Highfields.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.storyofleicester.info/a-place-to-live/the-blitz-in-highfields/ |title=The Blitz in Highfields |work=Story of Leicester |access-date=16 October 2022 |archive-date=16 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221016141004/https://www.storyofleicester.info/a-place-to-live/the-blitz-in-highfields/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Contemporary===
The years after [[World War II]], particularly from the 1960s onwards, brought many social and economic challenges.

====Urban expansion; central rapprochement====
[[File:Aerial-Leicester 2.017.jpg|thumb|upright 1.5|Central Leicester (looking WNW)]]
Mass housebuilding continued across Leicester for some 30 years after 1945. Existing housing estates such as Braunstone were expanded, while several completely new estates – of both private and council tenure – were built.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The last major development of this era was Beaumont Leys in the north of the city, which was developed in the 1970s as a mix of private and council housing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

There was a steady decline in Leicester's traditional manufacturing industries and, in the city centre, working factories and light industrial premises have now been almost entirely replaced. Many former factories, including some on [[Frog Island, Leicester|Frog Island]] and at [[River Soar#Donisthorpe Mill|Donisthorpe Mill]], have been badly damaged by fire. Rail and barge were finally eclipsed by automotive transport in the 1960s and 1970s: the Great Central and the Leicester and Swannington both closed and the northward extension of the [[M1 motorway]] linked Leicester into England's growing motorway network. With the loss of much of the city's industry during the 1970s and 1980s, some of the old industrial jobs were replaced by new jobs in the service sector, particularly in retail. The opening of the Haymarket Shopping Centre in 1971 was followed by a number of new shopping centres in the city, including St Martin's Shopping Centre in 1984 and the Shire Shopping Centre in 1992.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/leicester.html |title=A History of Leicester |access-date=29 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704145750/http://www.localhistories.org/leicester.html |archive-date=4 July 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The Shires was subsequently expanded in September 2008 and rebranded as Highcross.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highcrossleicester.com/website/tm_highcross.aspx |title=Highcross - Highcross |access-date=8 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117114435/http://www.highcrossleicester.com/website/tm_highcross.aspx |archive-date=17 January 2012}}</ref> By the 1990s, as well, Leicester's central position and good transport links had established it as a distribution centre; the southwestern area of the city has also attracted new service and manufacturing businesses.

====Immigration====
[[File:Leicester city council advert on Ugandan Argus.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1972 advertisement in the ''[[New Vision|Uganda Argus]]'' newspaper to discourage Ugandan Asians from settling in Leicester]]
Since World War II Leicester has experienced large scale immigration from across the world. Many Polish servicemen were prevented from returning to their homeland after the war by the communist regime,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/982.html |title=Poles |website=Encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org |access-date=9 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210034745/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/982.html |archive-date=10 February 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> and they established a small community in Leicester. Economic migrants from the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish Republic]] continued to arrive throughout the post war period. Immigrants from the [[Indian sub-continent]] began to arrive in the 1960s, their numbers boosted by [[South Asia|Asians]] arriving from Kenya and Uganda in the early 1970s.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/leicester/around_leicester/2002/09/ugandan_asians_leicester_changes.shtml Leicester's Ugandan Asian success story.] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401011706/http://www.bbc.co.uk/leicester/around_leicester/2002/09/ugandan_asians_leicester_changes.shtml |date=1 April 2012 }} Retrieved 28 November 2010.</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/leicester/content/articles/2005/10/10/al_leicester_backgrounder_feature.shtml A history of Leicester.] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108054953/http://www.bbc.co.uk/leicester/content/articles/2005/10/10/al_leicester_backgrounder_feature.shtml |date=8 November 2011 }} Retrieved 28 November 2010.</ref>

Forty years later, Leicester's mayor Sir [[Peter Soulsby]] expressed his regret for the behaviour of the council at the time.<ref name=uganda3>{{cite news |title=Ugandan Asians advert 'foolish', says Leicester councillor |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-19165216 |access-date=7 April 2013 |work=BBC News |date=8 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124050308/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-19165216 |archive-date=24 November 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 1990s, a group of Dutch citizens of [[Somali people|Somali]] origin settled in the city. Since the 2004 [[enlargement of the European Union]] a significant number of [[East European]] migrants have settled in the city. While some wards in the northeast of the city are more than 70% South Asian, wards in the west and south are all over 70% white. The [[Commission for Racial Equality]] (CRE) had estimated that by 2011 Leicester would have approximately a 50% ethnic minority population, making it the first city in Britain not to have a [[white British]] majority.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web |url=http://www.cre.gov.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-0hgnew0cq.RefLocID-0hg00900c008.Lang-EN.htm |title=Scoring goals for integration in Leicester: CRE helps kids and coaches use football to bring communities together |date=30 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930020356/http://www.cre.gov.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-0hgnew0cq.RefLocID-0hg00900c008.Lang-EN.htm |access-date=27 June 2022 |archive-date=30 September 2007}}</ref> This prediction was based on the growth of the ethnic minority populations between 1991 (Census 1991 28% ethnic minority) and 2001 (Census 2001 – 36% ethnic minority). However, Professor Ludi Simpson at the [[University of Manchester]] School of Social Sciences said in September 2007 that the CRE had "made unsubstantiated claims and ignored government statistics" and that Leicester's immigrant and minority communities disperse to other places.<ref>[http://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/news/unilife/1007/research/#d.en.124216] {{dead link|date=July 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ccsr.ac.uk/research/mrpd/events/documents/BSPS07SimpsonFinneyMinorityWhiteCities.doc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129182053/http://www.ccsr.ac.uk/research/mrpd/events/documents/BSPS07SimpsonFinneyMinorityWhiteCities.doc |url-status=dead |title=Research2 |archive-date=29 November 2007}}</ref><ref name="auto"/>

====Coronavirus====
The [[COVID-19 pandemic]] has brought many social and economic challenges across the country and across the world. Leicester has been particularly badly affected in the United Kingdom; from July 2020 during the imposition of the first local lockdown which saw all non-essential retail closed again and businesses such as public houses, restaurants and hairdressers unable to reopen. Businesses such as these in areas such as Glenfield and that part of Braunstone Town which outside of the formal city council area, have since been allowed to reopen following a more tightly defined lockdown area from 18 July 2020.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-53447863 |title=Leicester lockdown: 'I needn't have cancelled our holiday' |work=BBC News |date=18 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/754/contents/made |title=The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Leicester) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 |website=Legislation.gov.uk |access-date=27 June 2022 |archive-date=9 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220709023008/https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/754/contents/made |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Office for National Statistics]] has defined a [[Leicester Urban Area]] (LUA); broadly the immediate Leicester [[conurbation]], although without administrative status. The LUA contains the unitary authority area and several towns, villages and suburbs outside the city's administrative boundaries.

==Governance==
[[File:Leicester Town Hall 13795509814 80de745302 o.jpg|thumb|[[Leicester Town Hall]], completed in 1876]]
On 5 May 2011, the [[directly elected]] [[Mayor of Leicester]] role came into effect after the inaugural election. This post exists in addition to that of [[Lord mayor|Lord Mayor]] which goes back to the Middle Ages and is these days a ceremonial role.

The first mayor of Leicester was a [[Normans|Norman]] knight, Peter fitz Roger ("Peter, son of Roger") in 1251.<ref>Agnes Johnson Glimpses of ancient Leicester – Page 60 1891 "The first Mayor of Leicester, A.D. 1251.</ref><ref>The history of the boroughs and municipal corporations of the ... – Page 229 [[Henry Alworth Merewether]], Archibald John Stephens – 1835 "The mayor of Leicester and his brethren, having, with the consent of the commonalty, by the last ordinance, placed the town under the government of the aldermen, appear, in the 4th year of the reign of King Henry VII., to have adopted 1488. a ..."</ref> Following the restoration of city status in 1919 this title was elevated to "Lord Mayor."

On 1 April 1997, [[Leicester City Council]] became a [[unitary authority]]. Previously, local government had been a two-tier system: the city and county councils were responsible for different aspects of local-government services. That system is still in place in the rest of Leicestershire. [[Leicestershire County Council]] retained its headquarters at [[County Hall, Glenfield|County Hall]] in [[Glenfield, Leicestershire|Glenfield]], just outside the city boundary but within the urban area. The administrative offices of Leicester City Council are in the centre of the city at [[City Hall, Leicester|City Hall]] in Charles Street, having moved from Welford Place. The 1970s council offices at Welford Place were declared unsafe in 2010 and demolished on 22 February 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://metro.co.uk/2015/02/22/citys-skyline-changed-as-council-offices-are-pulled-down-5074128/ |title=City's skyline changed as council offices are pulled down |author=Hartley-Parkinson, Richard |website=Metro |date=22 February 2015 |access-date=24 January 2022 |archive-date=24 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220124184426/https://metro.co.uk/2015/02/22/citys-skyline-changed-as-council-offices-are-pulled-down-5074128/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2018 a newly built New Walk Centre was completed as a privately funded mix of offices, shops and flats, alongside tree-lined open spaces.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.procon-leicestershire.co.uk/procon-awards/2018-awards/project/redevelopment-of-the-former-leicester-city-council-site-new-walk-leicester |title=Redevelopment of the former Leicester City Council site, New Walk, Leicester |website=Procon-leicestershire.co.uk |access-date=24 January 2022 |archive-date=24 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220124184427/https://www.procon-leicestershire.co.uk/procon-awards/2018-awards/project/redevelopment-of-the-former-leicester-city-council-site-new-walk-leicester |url-status=dead}}</ref> Some services (particularly the police and the ambulance service) still cover the whole of the city and county, but for the most part the councils are independent.

Leicester is divided into 21 electoral wards: [[Abbey]], [[Aylestone]], [[Beaumont Leys]], [[Belgrave, Leicester|Belgrave]], [[Braunstone Park]] & Rowley Fields, Castle, [[Evington]], [[Eyres Monsell]], Fosse, [[Humberstone & Hamilton]], [[Knighton, Leicester|Knighton]], [[North Evington]], [[Rushey Mead]], Saffron, [[Spinney Hills]], [[Stoneygate]], [[Thurncourt]], Troon, Westcotes, Western, and Wycliffe.<ref>"[https://www.leicester.gov.uk/media/179879/city-mayor-and-ward-councillors-july-2016.pdf Leicester City Mayor and Councillors] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221145203/http://www.leicester.gov.uk/media/179879/city-mayor-and-ward-councillors-july-2016.pdf |date=21 December 2016 }}", Leicester City Council, July 2016. Retrieved 13 January 2017</ref>

===Political control===
The current directly elected mayor is Sir Peter Soulsby of the Labour Party.<ref>{{Cite news |date=6 May 2011 |title=BBC |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-13309051 |access-date=16 August 2011 |archive-date=19 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719185517/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-13309051 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Sir Peter Soulsby |url=http://www.cabinet.leicester.gov.uk:8071/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=955 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107023414/http://www.cabinet.leicester.gov.uk:8071/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=955 |archive-date=7 November 2018 |access-date=16 August 2020 |website=Leicester City Council}}</ref>

After a long period of Labour administration (since 1979), the city council from May 2003 was run by a [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]]/[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] coalition under [[Roger Blackmore]], which collapsed in November 2004. The minority Labour group ran the city until May 2005, under Ross Willmott, when the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives formed a new coalition, again under the leadership of Roger Blackmore.

In the local government elections of 3 May 2007, Leicester's Labour Party once again took control of the council in what can be described as a [[landslide victory]]. Gaining 18 new councillors, Labour polled on the day 38 councillors, creating a governing majority of +20. Significantly however, the Green Party gained its first councillors in the Castle Ward, after losing on the drawing of lots in 2003, though one of these subsequently resigned and the seat was lost to Labour in a by-election on 10 September 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leicester.gov.uk/councillors-democracy-and-elections/elections-and-electoral-registration/elections/ |title=Leicester City Council - Elections |access-date=17 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204234623/https://www.leicester.gov.uk/councillors-democracy-and-elections/elections-and-electoral-registration/elections/ |archive-date=4 February 2010}}</ref> The Conservative Party saw a decrease in their representation. The Liberal Democrat Party was the major loser, dropping from 25 councillors in 2003 to only 6 in 2007. This was in part due to the local party splitting, with a number of councillors standing for the [[Liberal Party (UK, 1989)|Liberal Party]].

In the local government elections of 5 May 2011 and those of May 2015, Labour won 52 of the city's 54 seats, with the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats winning one seat each.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leicester.gov.uk/elections2011/wardResults.aspx |title=Elections and voting |access-date=7 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509042623/http://www.leicester.gov.uk/elections2011/wardResults.aspx |archive-date=9 May 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In the 2019 local elections, the Labour Party gained the sole Conservative held ward of Knighton leaving [[Nigel Porter]] of the Liberal Democrats as the only opposition member on the city council.

There have been four changes in party affiliation since the last full council election in May 2023. Councillor Diane Cank left the Labour group in August 2023. Councillor Sanjay Modhwadia, the Conservative Party candidate in the [[Mayor of Leicester|2024 Leicester mayoral election]], was suspended from the Conservative Party following an argument with group leader Deepak Bajaj in a public car park over who should be the next group leader.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/leicester-news/leicester-councillor-suspended-party-after-9189720 |title=Councillor suspended after accusations of threatening behaviour |date=26 March 2024 |access-date=26 March 2024 |archive-date=26 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240326194917/https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/leicester-news/leicester-councillor-suspended-party-after-9189720 |url-status=live }}</ref> Conservative group leader Deepak Bajaj subsequently defected to the Labour Party on 8 April, lambasting a culture of violence, racism, religious divides, threats and bullying within the Conservative Party in Leicester.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://leicestertimes.com/leicester-news/conservative-group-leader-quits-party-and-rejoins-labour-amid-bullying-allegations/44788/ |title=Conservative Group Leader quits party and rejoins Labour amid 'bullying' allegations – Leicester Times &#124; Weekly Newspaper &#124; Leicester News |date=8 April 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/leicester-news/leader-leicesters-conservative-party-returns-9211872 |title=City's Conservative Party leader returns to Labour fold |date=8 April 2024 |access-date=12 April 2024 |archive-date=12 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240412071055/https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/leicester-news/leader-leicesters-conservative-party-returns-9211872 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2v90dqd1p6o |title=Leader of Leicester's Conservative Party returns to Labour |access-date=12 April 2024 |archive-date=11 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240411083859/https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2v90dqd1p6o |url-status=live }}</ref> The conservative group was further reduced in June 2024 when councillor Nagarjun "Nags" Agath quit the party to stand as an independent candidate in [[Leicester East]] in the [[2024 United Kingdom general election]].

===Representation at Westminster===
In the [[2024 United Kingdom general election|2024 general election]], Leicester is divided into three Parliamentary constituencies: [[Leicester East (UK Parliament constituency)|Leicester East]], represented by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] MP [[Shivani Raja]], [[Leicester South (UK Parliament constituency)|Leicester South]], represented by independent MP [[Shockat Adam]], and [[Leicester West (UK Parliament constituency)|Leicester West]] represented by Work and Pensions Secretary [[Liz Kendall]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

===Coat of arms===
[[File:Arms of Leicester.svg|thumb|upright|Arms of the City of Leicester: ''Gules, a cinquefoil ermine pierced of the field'']]
[[File:Coat of Arms of Leicester City Council.svg|thumb|Full coat of arms with the supporters granted in 1929]]
The Corporation of Leicester's [[coat of arms]] was first granted to the city at the Heraldic Visitation of 1619, and is based on the arms of the first [[Earl of Leicester]], Robert Beaumont. The charge is a [[cinquefoil]] ermine, on a red field, and this emblem is used by the city council.

After Leicester became a city again in 1919, the city council applied to add to the arms. Permission for this was granted in 1929, when the supporting lions, from the Lancastrian Earls of Leicester, were added.

The motto ''"Semper Eadem"'' was the motto of [[Queen Elizabeth I]], who granted a royal charter to the city. It means "always the same" but with positive overtones meaning unchanging, reliable or dependable, and united. The crest on top of the arms is a white or silver legless [[wyvern]] with red and white wounds showing, on a wreath of red and white. The legless wyvern distinguishes it as a Leicester wyvern as opposed to other wyverns. The supporting lions are wearing coronets in the form of collars, with the white cinquefoil hanging from them.

In the 2011 census, the population of the Leicester unitary authority area was 329,839, an increase of 11.8% compared to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001]] figure of 279,921. The wider [[Leicester Urban Area]],<ref name="BUA">{{cite web |url=http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/747.aspx |title=2011 Census – Built-up areas |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics|ONS]] |access-date=8 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921045319/http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/747.aspx |archive-date=21 September 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> showed an estimated population of 509,000. The population of the Leicester unitary authority area is marginally higher than that of Nottingham, while Nottingham has a higher urban area population compared to Leicester. [[Eurostat]]'s [[Larger Urban Zone]] lists the population of the Leicester LUZ at 886,673 (2017) below that of Nottingham;<ref>{{cite web |title=Population on 1 January by age groups and sex – functional urban areas |url=http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=urb_lpop1&lang=en |website=Eurostat – Data Explorer |publisher=Eurostat |access-date=14 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903213351/http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=urb_lpop1&lang=en |archive-date=3 September 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> metropolitan and city region populations tend to be similar. According to the 2011 census Leicester had the largest proportion of people aged 19-and-under in the East Midlands at 27 per cent. Coventry, to the south west, has a population of 352,900 (2016 est.) compared to Leicester's 348,300 at the same date. Nonetheless, Coventry has an area one third greater than Leicester's, approximately equivalent to a combined 'Leicester + [[Oadby and Wigston]]' with a respective population of 404,100 (2016 est.).

The Eurostat regional yearbook 2015 classifies Leicester as one of country's eleven 'Greater Cities', together with Birmingham and Nottingham in the Midlands. Leicester is second only to Bristol as the largest [[unitary authority]] city in England ([[List of English districts by population]] 2015 estimates), and ninth largest counting both unitary authority cities and cities within metropolitan counties.

===Languages===
A demographic profile of Leicester published by the city council in 2008 noted:

{{blockquote|Alongside English, around 70 languages and/or dialects spoken in the city. In addition to English and the primary western and central European languages, eight ethnic languages are sometimes heard: [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] is the preferred language of 16% of the city's residents, [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] 3%, [[Somali language|Somali]] 4% and [[Urdu language|Urdu]] 2%. Other smaller language groups include [[Hindi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. With continuing migration into the city, new languages and or dialects from Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe are also being spoken in the city.

In certain primary schools in Leicester, English may not be the preferred language of 45% of pupils and the proportion of children whose first language is known, or believed to be, other than English, is significantly higher than other cities in the Midlands or the UK as a whole.<ref name="DiversityOfLeicesterMay2008">{{cite web |url=http://www.leicesterpartnership.org.uk/EasySite/lib/serveDocument.asp?doc=111607&pgid=113861 |title=The Diversity of Leicester May 2008, A Demographic Profile |publisher=[[Leicester City Council]] |access-date=16 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108034740/http://www.leicesterpartnership.org.uk/EasySite/lib/serveDocument.asp?doc=111607&pgid=113861 |archive-date=8 January 2009}}</ref>}}

Certain European languages such as Polish will undoubtedly feature in current statistics, although their prevalence may reduce subsequently as future generations rapidly assimilate or return to places of origin, given cultural and geographic proximity and changes in the geo-political environment.

===Textiles===
The city has historically had a strong association with the production of textiles, clothing and shoes. While important companies such as [[N. Corah & Sons|Corah]], [[Liberty Shoes (Leicester, England)|Liberty Shoes]] and Equity Shoes have closed, companies such as Next and [[Boden (clothing)|Boden]] are still active and [[ASOS (retailer)|ASOS]] and [[New Look (company)|New Look]] manufacture in the city. Moreover, in recent years the higher transport prices and longer lead-times associated with [[Globalization|globalised]] production in Asia mean some textile manufacturers are locating to the city.<ref>{{cite news |title=Leicester in spotlight for textiles boost |date=11 January 2011 |url=http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/City-spotlight-textile-boost/story-12041696-detail/story.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130505125301/http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/City-spotlight-textile-boost/story-12041696-detail/story.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 May 2013 |work=Leicester Mercury |access-date=14 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Far Eastern costs boost textile firm |date=15 September 2010 |url=http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/Far-Eastern-costs-boost-textile-firm/story-12038789-detail/story.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130505100106/http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/Far-Eastern-costs-boost-textile-firm/story-12038789-detail/story.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 May 2013 |work=Leicester Mercury |access-date=14 January 2013}}</ref>

There have long been concerns about the working conditions in this sector. Leicester's garment district is home to more than 1,000 factories employing as many as 10,000 workers. It has received fewer than 60 [[Health and safety regulations in the United Kingdom|health and safety inspections]] and only 28 [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom|fire inspections]] since October 2017. [[HMRC]] has made just 36 visits checking on compliance with [[National Minimum Wage Act 1998|minimum wage legislation]]; it has issued penalties to fewer than 10 textile firms and claimed just over £100,000 in arrears relating to 143 workers.<ref name="butler">{{cite news |last1=Butler |first1=Sarah |title=Revealed: 'shocking' lack of regulation at Leicester garment factories |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/30/revealed-shocking-lack-of-regulation-at-leicester-garment-factories |access-date=30 August 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=30 August 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Research at the University of Leicester in 2010 and published in 2015 found there were 11,700 employees where 75-90% were being paid £3 per hour, which was less than half of the then legal minimum wage.<ref name="3 pounds">{{cite news |last1=Hoskins |first1=Tansy |title=Made in Britain: UK textile workers earning £3 per hour |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-fashion-blog/2015/feb/27/made-in-britain-uk-textile-workers-earning-3-per-hour |access-date=30 August 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=27 February 2015}}</ref> In 2017 [[Peter Soulsby]], Mayor of Leicester called together 40 regulatory organisations to coordinate a response.

===Engineering===
Engineering companies include Jones & Shipman (machine tools and control systems), Richards Engineering (foundry equipment), Transmon Engineering (materials handling equipment) and [[Trelleborg AB|Trelleborg]] (suspension components for rail, marine, and industrial applications). Local commitment to nurturing British engineers includes apprenticeship schemes with local companies, and academic-industrial connections with the engineering departments at [[Leicester University]], [[De Montfort University]], and nearby [[Loughborough University]]. Leicester was also home to the famous [[Gents' of Leicester]] clock manufacturers.

===Shopping===
[[File:Leicester City Centre.jpg|thumb|Main city centre shopping area]]
The city centre has two large shopping malls – [[Highcross Leicester]] and the [[Haymarket Shopping Centre]]. The Haymarket Shopping Centre opened in 1974 and has two levels of shopping, multi-storey parking for up to 500 cars, a bus station and is home to the [[Haymarket Theatre (Leicester)|Haymarket Theatre]]. Highcross Leicester opened in 2008 after work to redevelop "The Shires Centre" was completed at a cost of £350&nbsp;million (creating 120 stores, 15 restaurants, a cinema, 110,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> of shopping space).

St Martin's Square and the Leicester Lanes area has numerous designer and specialist shops; several of the city's Victorian arcades are located in the same neighbourhood.

Henry Walker was a successful pork butcher who moved from [[Mansfield]] to Leicester in the 1880s to take over an established business in High Street. The first Walker's crisp production line was in the empty upper storey of Walker's Oxford Street factory in Leicester. In the early days the potatoes were sliced by hand and cooked in an ordinary [[deep fryer]]. In 1971 the [[Walkers (snack foods)|Walker's]] crisps business was sold to [[Standard Brands]], an American firm, who sold on the company to [[Frito-Lay]].

The main bus operators for Leicester and the surrounding area are [[Arriva Fox County]], [[Centrebus]], [[First Leicester]], [[Arriva Midlands|Hinckley Bus (Part of Arriva Midlands)]], [[Kinchbus]], Leicester Bus and [[Stagecoach in Northants|Stagecoach Midlands]].

The [[Star trak real time]] system was introduced in 2000 by Leicester City Council; it allowed bus tracking and the retrieval of bus times by text message or online. The system was discontinued in 2011.

There are three permanent [[Park and Ride]] sites at Meynells Gorse (Leicester Forest East), Birstall and Enderby; buses operate every 15 mins from all sites. The park and ride services are branded as ''quicksilver shuttle'' and are contracted to Roberts' Coaches from the [[Leicester City Council|City Council]] and [[Leicestershire County Council|County Council]]; buses use a purpose-built terminal near St. Nicholas Circle.

Leicester has two circular bus services: [[Hop!]] which operates anticlockwise in the city centre via the railway station and Haymarket bus station, and the larger {{Convert|30|mi|km|abbr=off|adj=on}} long [[Orbital (bus service)|Orbital]] which operates in both directions.<ref>{{Cite web |title=greenlines |url=https://www.leicesterbuses.co.uk/greenlines |access-date=8 May 2023 |website=Leicester Buses |language=en-GB |archive-date=8 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230508180858/https://www.leicesterbuses.co.uk/greenlines |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=17 October 2022 |title=Longest electric circular bus route launches in Leicester |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leicestershire-63288216 |access-date=8 May 2023}}</ref>

===Railway===
====Mainline rail====
[[File:Leicester Railway Station from south.jpg|thumb|[[Leicester railway station]] lies on the eastern side of the city centre on the [[A6 road (Great Britain)|A6]] London Road]]

The rail network is of growing importance in Leicester and, with the start of [[Eurostar]] international services from [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras International]] in November 2007, [[Leicester railway station]] has gained connections at St. Pancras station to Lille, Brussels and Paris onwards.

Inter-city services are operated by [[East Midlands Railway]] providing connectivity on 'fast' and 'semi-fast' services to London, the south-east and to major locations in the East Midlands and Yorkshire; there are also local services operating within the East Midlands region. Trans-regional services to the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] and [[East Anglia]] are provided by [[CrossCountry]], enabling connections at nearby [[Nuneaton railway station|Nuneaton]], onto the [[West Coast main line]], and at [[Peterborough railway station|Peterborough]] to the [[East Coast Main Line]].

The {{convert|99|mi}} from [[Leicester Railway Station]] to [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras International]] on the Midland Main Line are covered in an average of 1{{nbsp}}hour 25{{nbsp}}minutes during the morning peak, with journey times as low as 1{{nbsp}}hour 6{{nbsp}}minutes later in the day. Transfers onto [[London Underground]] or [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]] train services to London City or West End add another 15 to 25{{nbsp}}minutes to the journey time; double that to Canary Wharf. The journey time to [[Sheffield]] is around one hour, with Leeds and York taking approximately two. [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham]] is 50{{nbsp}}minutes away and [[Cambridge railway station|Cambridge]], via Peterborough, can be reached in around 1{{nbsp}}hour 55{{nbsp}}minutes with further direct services available onto Stansted Airport in north Essex.

====Great Central Railway====
{{Main|Great Central Railway}}
The decommissioned [[Leicester Central railway station]] is on the late Victorian Great Central Railway line that ran from London Marylebone northwards. [[Beeching cuts]] closed the route in the late 1960s. A preserved section, however, remains operational in the East Midlands centred on [[Loughborough Central railway station]] providing tourist services through central Leicestershire'','' passing Swithland Reservoir on to the [[Leicester North railway station]] terminus.

===Waterways===
[[File:River Soar in Leicester.jpg|thumb|Section of the River Soar in central Leicester]]
Two navigable waterways join at Leicester: The [[Grand Union Canal#The Leicester Line|Leicester Line]] of the [[Grand Union Canal]], and the [[River Soar]] Navigation. The Grand Union Canal links Leicester with London and Birmingham to the south, and joins the Soar in Leicester, which links the city to the [[River Trent]], and the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]] to the north.<ref>{{cite web |title=Grand Union Canal – Leicester Line |url=https://waterways.org.uk/waterways/discover-the-waterways/grand-union-canal-leicester-line |publisher=Inland Waterways Association |access-date=23 May 2022 |archive-date=26 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220526202856/https://waterways.org.uk/waterways/discover-the-waterways/grand-union-canal-leicester-line |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Education==
===Schools===
{{Main|List of schools in Leicester}}
Leicester is home to a number of comprehensive schools and independent schools. There are three sixth form colleges, all of which were previously grammar schools.

The Leicester City [[Local Education Authority]] initially had a troubled history when formed in 1997 as part of the local government reorganisation – a 1999 [[Ofsted]] inspection found "few strengths and many weaknesses", although there has been considerable improvement since then.

[[Tudor Grange Samworth Academy]] an [[Academy (English school)|academy]] whose catchment area includes the Saffron and Eyres Monsell estates, was co-sponsored by the [[Church of England]] and David Samworth, chairman of Samworth Brothers pasty makers.

Under the "Building Schools for the Future" project, Leicester City Council has contracted with developers Miller Consortium for £315&nbsp;million to rebuild [[Beaumont Leys School]], [[Judgemeadow Community College]], the [[City of Leicester College]] in Evington, and [[Soar Valley College]] in Rushey Mead, and to refurbish Fullhurst Community College in Braunstone.<ref>''[http://thisisleicestershire.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=132407&command=displayContent&sourceNode=132390&contentPK=19305931&moduleName=InternalSearch&formname=sidebarsearch Schools building deal is signed and sealed] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513085442/http://thisisleicestershire.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=132407&command=displayContent&sourceNode=132390&contentPK=19305931&moduleName=InternalSearch&formname=sidebarsearch |date=13 May 2015 }}'' – ''[[Leicester Mercury]]'', 19 December 2007</ref>

The [[Church of England parish church]] of [[St Nicholas Church, Leicester|St Nicholas]] is the oldest place of worship in the city. Parts of the church certainly date from about 880 AD, and a recent architectural survey suggested possible Roman building work. The tower is [[Norman architecture|Norman]]. By 1825 the church was in an extremely poor condition, and plans were made for its demolition. Instead, it was extensively renovated between 1875 and 1884, including the building of a new north [[aisle]]. Renovation continued into the twentieth century. A fifteenth-century octagonal [[Baptismal font|font]]. from the redundant [[Church of St Michael the Greater, Stamford]], was transferred to St Nicholas.<ref>{{cite web |title=20th Century |url=https://history.stnicholasleicester.com/1900-s.html |website=Welcome to St Nicholas Church in Leicester History Section |access-date=15 February 2020 |archive-date=15 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215080043/https://history.stnicholasleicester.com/1900-s.html |url-status=dead}}</ref>

St Peter's Lane takes its name from the former medieval church of that name, which closed in the 1570s, its parish having merged with All Saints church.<ref>{{cite web |title=The ancient borough: Lost churches Pages 388-389 A History of the County of Leicester: Volume 4, the City of Leicester. |url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/leics/vol4/pp388-389 |website=British History Online |access-date=20 September 2021 |archive-date=20 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210920212338/https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/leics/vol4/pp388-389 |url-status=live }}</ref>

From the mid 17th century Leicester became a noted centre for [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Protestant Nonconformity]] and many sects constructed places of worship in the city including the [[Baptist Union of Great Britain|Baptists]], the [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], the [[Quakers]], the [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Methodists]], and the [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]]. By the 19th century the Baptist, Methodist, and Congregational presence had grown to include churches in several districts across the city and the [[Nonconformist conscience]] did much to impact the city's progressive politics. Many of these congregations are still active. In the aftermath of [[Catholic Emancipation]] in the 19th century a number of [[Roman Catholic]] churches and schools have been established in the city (see [[Catholic churches in Leicester]]).<ref name="Moore, Andre 2008">{{Cite book |title=Where Leicester Has Worshipped |url=http://www.laurel-house.co.uk/where-leicester-has-worshipped.html |year=2008 |author=Moore, Andre |publisher=Laurel House |isbn=978-0-9533628-2-0 |access-date=14 January 2020 |archive-date=22 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922204915/http://laurel-house.co.uk/where-leicester-has-worshipped.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="storyofleicester.info">{{Cite web |url=https://www.storyofleicester.info/faith-belief/ |title=Faith & Belief – Story of Leicester |website=Storyofleicester.info |access-date=14 January 2020 |archive-date=23 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200523161356/https://www.storyofleicester.info/faith-belief/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name = hist1958>{{cite web |title=The ancient borough: Protestant Nonconformity: A History of the County of Leicester: Volume 4 |publisher=Victoria County History |pages=390–394 |year=1958 |url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/leics/vol4/pp390-394#h3-0003 |access-date=11 January 2020 |quote=1601}}</ref>

Leicester is the setting for the fictional diaries of [[Adrian Mole]], created by [[Sue Townsend]]. In the early books he lives in a suburb of Leicester and attends a local school where he first meets "the love of his life", Pandora Braithwaite.

After a period of years spent working in Oxford and London, Mole returns to Leicester and gets a job in a second-hand bookshop and a flat in an "upmarket" development on a swan-infested waterfront, which is a barely disguised representation of the area near to St. Nicholas Circle. Vastly in debt he is forced to move to the fictional village of Mangold Parva. The local (fictional) [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the town of Ashby de la Zouch is his old flame, Pandora Braithwaite.

Leicester is the setting for [[Rod Duncan]]'s novels, the ''Fall of the Gas-Lit Empire'' series and the Riot trilogy.
