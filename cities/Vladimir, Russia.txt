'''Vladimir''' ({{langx|ru|Влади́мир}}, {{IPA|ru|vlɐ'dʲimʲɪr|IPA|Ru-Владимир.ogg}}) is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] and the [[administrative center]] of [[Vladimir Oblast]], Russia, located on the [[Klyazma River]], {{convert|200|km|sp=us}} east of [[Moscow]]. It is served by a railway and the [[M7 motorway (Russia)|M7 motorway]]. Population: {{ru-census2021|349,951|punct=.}}

==History==
Vladimir was [[Vladimir-Suzdal|one of the medieval capitals of Russia]], with significant buildings surviving from the 12th century. Two of its Russian Orthodox cathedrals, a monastery, and associated buildings have been designated among the [[White Monuments of Vladimir and Suzdal]], a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]. In the past, the city was also known as '''Vladimir-on-Klyazma''' ({{lang|ru|Владимир-на-Клязьме}})<ref>[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/brokgauz_efron/22867/%D0%92%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80 Vladimir-on-Klyazma] at the [[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]].</ref> and '''Vladimir-Zalessky''' ({{lang|ru|Владимир-Залесский}}), to distinguish it from [[Volodymyr, Volyn Oblast|another Vladimir/Volodymyr]] in [[Volhynia]] (modern-day [[Ukraine]]).

===Foundation===
[[File:Південно-Східна Європа 1684.JPG|left|thumb|17th century map]]
The founding date of Vladimir is disputed between 990 and 1108. In the ''[[Novgorod First Chronicle]]'', Vladimir is mentioned under the year 1108, and during the Soviet period, this year was decreed to be its foundation year with the view that attributes the founding of the city, and its name, to [[Vladimir II Monomakh|Vladimir Monomakh]], who inherited the region as part of the [[Vladimir-Suzdal|Rostov-Suzdal Principality]] in 1093.<ref>''Воронин&nbsp;Н.&nbsp;Н.'' [http://www.russiancity.ru/dbooks/d02.htm Из ранней истории Владимира и его округи. // Советская археология.&nbsp;— 1959.&nbsp;— №&nbsp;4.&nbsp;— С. 74—81.]</ref> It is named there as ''Vladimir''.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Gorod Vladimir [1108-1958]: istoriko-ėkonomicheskiĭ ocherk|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SzflAAAAMAAJ&q=%25D0%2592%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580+%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4|publisher = Владимирское книжное изд-во|date = 1958-01-01|language = ru|first = S.|last = Larin}}</ref> The chronicles also describe how inhabitants from neighbouring towns, namely [[Suzdal]] and [[Rostov, Yaroslavl Oblast|Rostov]], alluded to Vladimir as a young town.<ref>Новгородская первая летопись старшего и младшего изводов. — М.—Л.: Академия наук СССР, 1950. — С. 467.</ref> Accordingly, the 850th anniversary of the city foundation was celebrated in 1958, with many monuments from the celebrations adorning the city; this enabled [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who recently took power in the Soviet Union, to link his administration with early Russian history.

In the 1990s, a new opinion developed that the city was instead founded in 990 by [[Vladimir the Great]], with local historians supporting the alternative foundation date and citing various chronicle sources.<ref>К вопросу о дате основания г. Владимира. / Ред. С.&nbsp;В.&nbsp;Шевченко.&nbsp;— Владимир: Местное время, 1992.</ref><ref>[http://www.russiancity.ru/books/b82.htm#c2 Из письма академика Лихачёва Дмитрия Сергеевича]. Институт русской литературы (Пушкинский Дом).</ref> Scholars reinterpreted certain passages in the ''[[Hypatian Codex]],'' which mentions that the region was visited by [[Vladimir the Great]], the "father" of [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]], in 990, so as to move the city foundation date to that year. The Charter of Vladimir, the [[basic law]] of the city passed in 2005, explicitly mentions 990 as the date of the city's foundation.<ref name="Charter">Charter of Vladimir, Article&nbsp;3.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vladimir-city.ru/city/history.php|title=ИСТОРИЧЕСКАЯ СПРАВКА|website=vladimir-city.ru}}</ref> The city administration officially recognizes 990 as the foundation date.<ref>[http://zagraevsky.com/topography.htm Письмо администрации города Владимира №&nbsp;01-01-419 от 26 мая 2016&nbsp;г.]</ref>

===Vladimir-Suzdal===
{{Main|Vladimir-Suzdal}}

The city's most historically significant events occurred after the turn of the 12th century. Serving its original purpose as a defensive outpost for the [[Vladimir-Suzdal#Rostov-Suzdal|Rostov-Suzdal Principality]], Vladimir had little political or military influence throughout the reign of Vladimir Monomakh (1113–1125), or his son [[Yury Dolgoruky]] ("Far-Reaching") (1154–1157).
[[File:Успенский собор-2 (by Hd Elen).jpg|thumb|left|[[Dormition Cathedral, Vladimir|Dormition Cathedral]] was a venerated model for cathedrals all over Russia]]
[[File:Vladimir StDemetriusCathedral 6875.jpg|thumb|left|St.&nbsp;Demetrius' Cathedral, shown on this 2017 photo, is famous for its masterfully carved exterior, representing the [[Bible|Biblical]] story of [[David|King David]].]]

Under Dolgoruky's son, [[Andrey Bogolyubsky]] (1157–1175) (also known as Andrew the Pious), the city became the center of the [[Vladimir-Suzdal|Vladimir-Suzdal Principality]]. It had a Golden Age, which lasted until the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']] in 1237. During this time, Vladimir enjoyed immense growth and prosperity. Andrey oversaw the building of the city's [[Golden Gate (Vladimir)|Golden Gates]] and the [[Dormition Cathedral, Vladimir|Dormition Cathedral]]. In 1164, Andrey attempted to establish a new [[metropolitanate]] in Vladimir, separate from that of Kiev. He was rebuffed by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]].<ref>Janet Martin, ''Medieval Russia: 980-1584'' (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1995), 100.</ref>

Scores of Russian, [[Germans|German]], and [[Georgians|Georgian]] masons worked on Vladimir's white stone cathedrals, monastery, towers, and palaces. Unlike any other northern buildings, their exterior was elaborately carved with high [[relief]] stone sculptures. Only three of these edifices stand today: the Dormition Cathedral, the [[Cathedral of Saint Demetrius]], and the Golden Gate. They are included among the [[White Monuments of Vladimir and Suzdal]], designated as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]].
During Andrey's reign, a royal palace in [[Bogolyubovo, Vladimir Oblast|Bogolyubovo]] was built, as well as the world-famous [[Church of the Intercession on the Nerl]], now considered one of the jewels of ancient [[Russian architecture]]. Andrey was assassinated at his palace at [[Bogolyubovo, Vladimir Oblast|Bogolyubovo]] in 1175.

[[File:Mongols at the walls of Vladimir 1238 Vassily Maximov.jpg|thumb|Drawing of Mongols of the [[Golden Horde]] outside Vladimir presumably demanding submission before sacking the city]]

Vladimir was besieged by the [[Mongol]]-[[Tatar]]s of the [[Golden Horde]] under [[Batu Khan]]. It was finally overrun on February&nbsp;8, 1238. A great fire destroyed thirty-two limestone buildings on the first day alone, while the grand prince's family perished in a church where they sought refuge from the flames. The grand prince escaped, but was killed at the [[Battle of the Sit River]] the following month.

===Grand Principality of Moscow===

After the Mongols, Vladimir never fully recovered. The most important Rus' prince (usually the Prince of Moscow, but sometimes a Tver or another principality) was styled the Grand Prince of Vladimir, but the title had become an honorific symbol of majesty. From 1299 to 1325, the city was seat of the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitans]] of Kiev and All Rus', until [[Peter of Moscow|Metropolitan Peter]] moved the See to [[Moscow]] in 1325.

The Grand Princes of Vladimir were originally crowned in Vladimir's Assumption Cathedral, but when Moscow superseded Vladimir in the 14th century as the seat of the Grand Prince, the [[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow|Assumption Cathedral]] in the Moscow Kremlin became the site of their coronation. The Moscow cathedral was loosely copied by the Italian architect [[Aristotele Fioravanti]] from Vladimir's original.

After the rise of Moscow, Grand Princes of Moscow continued to build several new churches in Vladimir. Notable examples include the Annunciation Church at Snovitsy (ca.&nbsp;1501), three kilometers northwest of the city, and a church in the [[Knyaginin]] Nunnery (ca.&nbsp;1505), which today includes murals dating from 1648.

===Imperial Russia===
[[File:View_of_the_railroad,_city_of_Vladimir,_Kliazma_River,_and_water-meadows.jpg|left|thumb|200x200px|A view of Vladimir in 1911]]

Remains of the prince-saint [[Alexander Nevsky]] were kept in the ancient Nativity Abbey of Vladimir until 1703, when [[Peter the Great]] had them transferred to the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra|Monastery (now Lavra) of Alexander Nevsky]] in [[Saint Petersburg|St.&nbsp;Petersburg]]. The Nativity Church (built from 1191 to 1196) collapsed several years later, after workmen tried to fashion more windows in its walls in an effort to brighten the interior.

The city was the center of {{ill|Vladimir Province|ru|Владимирская провинция}}, part of [[Moscow Governorate]] from its establishment by Peter the Great in 1708.  Vladimir was separated from Moscow Governorate and made the center of a new {{ill|Vladimir Viceroyalty|ru|Владимирское наместничество}} by a ukase of [[Catherine the Great]] in 1778.  In 1796, [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]]'s administrative reform transformed the viceroyalty into the [[Vladimir Governorate]] in the same borders.

In the years 1838–1840, [[Alexander Herzen]] was exiled in Vladimir, passing through the city on the infamous ''[[Vladimirka]]''.

In December 1858 the city began to operate [[telegraph]].  On June 14, 1861,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eng.rzd.ru/statice/public/en?STRUCTURE_ID=4332&layer_id=4516&refererLayerId=4516&id=2554 |title=History of Russian rail lines {{!}} Russian Railways |website=eng.rzd.ru |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192253/http://eng.rzd.ru/statice/public/en?STRUCTURE_ID=4332&layer_id=4516&refererLayerId=4516&id=2554 |archive-date=2016-03-04}}</ref> the {{ill|Moscow–Nizhny Novgorod Railway|ru|Московско-Нижегородская железная дорога}} began to operate through Vladimir.  In 1866, construction of a running water supply was completed, with telephone lines being put up in 1887 and the first electrical power lines on December 5, 1908.

On November 29, 1898, Vladimir provincial scientific archival commission was established.

===Soviet Union===
After the establishment of Soviet power, many streets were renamed in Vladimir; most of the parish churches were closed and condemned to be demolished.

In the first decades of Soviet rule industrialization occurred in Vladimir.  On January&nbsp;14, 1929, the Vladimir Governorate was abolished and the city became part of the newly formed [[Ivanovo Industrial Oblast]].

On August&nbsp;14, 1944, Vladimir became the administrative center of a new [[Vladimir Oblast]] carved from [[Ivanovo Oblast]]. In 1950 from the basis of the teachers' institute the [[Vladimir Pedagogical Institute]] was created. On November 5, 1952, the first trolleybus line began to operate in the city.

In 1958 the {{ill|Vladimir–Suzdal Museum and Reserve|ru|Владимиро-Суздальский музей-заповедник}} was created, composed of a group of unique architectural monuments of Russian defense and church architecture.  The monuments are located in three cities—Vladimir, [[Suzdal]] and [[Gus-Khrustalny (town)|Gus-Khrustalny]]—as well as villages of [[Bogolyubovo, Vladimir Oblast|Bogolyubovo]] and [[Kideksha]].

Architecture of the Soviet period is present in structures such as  building complexes and polytechnic colleges, the [[Torpedo Stadium (Vladimir)|Torpedo Stadium]] (built 1952), a reinforced concrete arch bridge over the river Klyaz'ma (1960), the Hotel Vladimir (1956), the Drama Theatre (1971) and others. In 1971 the city was awarded the [[Order of Red Banner of Labor]].

==Economy and military==
Vladimir is home to several electrical and chemical factories, several food processing plants and two large thermal power stations. Tourism related to the historical sites is a major contributor to the city's economy.

The headquarters of the [[27th Guards Rocket Army]] of the [[Strategic Missile Troops]] is located in the city. During the [[Cold War]], Vladimir was host to the [[Dobrynskoye]] air force base.

==Transportation==
[[File:2018-03-21 Vladimir, RUS - A view to Railway station and Bus station.jpg|230px|thumb|right|A view to railway station and a bus terminal]]
Since 1861, there has been a [[railway]] connection between Vladimir and Moscow.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111216163751/http://www.nnov-airport.ru/rus/wokzal_vladimir.html Train Station in Vladimir {{in lang|ru}}]</ref> Vladimir is also linked to Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod by the [[M7 highway (Russia)|M7 highway]]. Local transport includes buses, trolleybuses, fixed-route minivans, and taxis.

Vladimir bus service links the city to all the district centers of Vladimir Oblast, as well as Moscow, [[Ivanovo]], [[Kostroma]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Ryazan]], [[Yaroslavl]] and other cities.

At least 20 pairs of long-distance trains pass daily through Vladimir station, giving Vladimir year-round direct rail links to Moscow ([[Kursky railway station|Kursk Station]]), St. Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod. Since the summer of 2010 Vladimir (on the Nizhny Novgorod line) is a stopping point for the "[[Sapsan|Peregrine Falcon]]" high-speed train.

Vladimir also possesses a developed suburban rail system. It was the only city in Russia with concurrent commuter trains two Russian cities with subways.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}
The city is served by the [[Semyazino Airport]] 5&nbsp;km west of the city center.

==Sightseeing==
Modern-day Vladimir is a part of the [[Golden Ring of Russia|Golden Ring]] of ancient Russian cities and a popular tourist destination. Its three chief monuments, [[White Monuments of Vladimir and Suzdal]], inscribed by [[UNESCO]] on the World Heritage List, are the following:
#The magnificent five-domed [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir|Dormition Cathedral]] was designed as the burial place of grand princes and dedicated to the holy icon the [[Theotokos of Vladimir]], which had been brought to the city by  Andrey Bogolyubsky. The cathedral was constructed in 1158–1160, expanded in 1185–1189, and painted by the great [[Andrei Rublev]] and [[Daniil Chyorny]] in 1408. In 1810, a lofty bell-tower was added in [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] style.
#The helmet-domed [[Cathedral of Saint Demetrius]] was built in 1194–1197 as a private chapel of Vsevolod the Big Nest in the courtyard of his palace and was consecrated to his holy patron, [[Saint Demetrius|St.&nbsp;Demetrius]].  For all its formal unity, the cathedral represents an international project of Russian and Byzantine masters, [[Friedrich Barbarossa]]'s masons, and carvers sent by Queen [[Tamar of Georgia]].
#The [[Golden Gate (Vladimir)|Golden Gate]], originally a tower over the city's main gate, was built in 1158–1164. The gate acquired its present form after having been reconstructed in the late 18th century, to prevent the dilapidated structure from tumbling down.
