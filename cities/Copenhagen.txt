The [[Øresund Bridge]] connects the two cities by rail and road.

Originally a [[Vikings|Viking]] fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now [[Gammel Strand]], Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. During the 16th century, the city served as the ''[[de facto]]'' capital of the [[Kalmar Union]] and the seat of the Union's monarchy, which governed most of the modern-day [[Nordic countries|Nordic region]] as part of a Danish [[confederation]] with Sweden and [[Norway]]. The city flourished as the cultural and economic centre of [[Scandinavia]] during the [[Renaissance]], and by the 17th century, it had become a regional centre of power, serving as the heart of the Danish government and [[Military history of Denmark|military]]. During the 18th century, Copenhagen suffered from a [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|devastating plague outbreak]] and urban [[conflagration]]s, and proceeded to undergo several major redevelopment efforts, which included the construction of the prestigious district of [[Frederiksstaden]] and the establishment of cultural institutions such as the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]]. The city also became the centre of the [[Danish slave trade]] during this period. In 1807, the city was [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|bombarded by a British fleet]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], before the [[Danish Golden Age]] brought a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical look]] to Copenhagen's architecture. After [[World War II]], the [[Finger Plan]] fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes emanating from the city centre.

Since the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the [[Culture of Denmark|cultural]], [[Economy of Denmark|economic]] and [[Politics of Denmark|governmental]] centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]]. Copenhagen's economy has developed rapidly in the [[service sector]], especially through initiatives in [[information technology]], [[pharmaceuticals]] and [[clean technology]]. Since the completion of the [[Øresund Bridge]], Copenhagen has increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of [[Scania]] and its largest city, Malmö, forming the [[Øresund Region]]. With several bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades, and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as [[Tivoli Gardens]], ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' statue, the [[Amalienborg]] and [[Christiansborg Palace|Christiansborg]] palaces, [[Rosenborg Castle]], [[Frederik's Church]], [[Børsen]] and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions.

Copenhagen is home to the [[University of Copenhagen]], the [[Technical University of Denmark]], [[Copenhagen Business School]], and the [[IT University of Copenhagen]]. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark. Copenhagen is home to the football clubs [[F.C. Copenhagen]] and [[Brøndby IF]]. The annual [[Copenhagen Marathon]] was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world. [[Movia (transit agency)|Movia]] is the public mass transit company serving all of eastern Denmark, except [[Bornholm]]. The [[Copenhagen Metro]], launched in 2002, serves central Copenhagen. Additionally, the [[S-train (Copenhagen)|Copenhagen S-train]], the [[Lokaltog]] ([[:da:Privatbane|private railway]]), and the [[Coast Line (Denmark)|Coast Line]] network serve and connect central Copenhagen to outlying boroughs. Serving roughly 2.5 million passengers a month, [[Copenhagen Airport]], Kastrup, is the busiest airport in the [[Nordic countries]].

==Etymology==
Copenhagen's name ({{Lang|da|København}} in Danish), reflects its origin as a harbour and a place of commerce. The original designation in [[Old Norse]], from which Danish descends, was '''{{Lang|non|Kaupmannahǫfn}}''' {{IPA-non|ˈkɔupˌmɑnːɑˌhɔvn|}} (cf. modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: {{Lang|is|Kaupmannahöfn}} {{IPA-is|ˈkʰœipˌmanːaˌhœpn̥|}}, {{Langx|fo|Keypmannahavn}}), meaning 'merchants' harbour'. By the time [[Old Danish]] was spoken, the capital was called '''{{Lang|mis|Køpmannæhafn}}'''<!-- Old Danish -->, with the current name deriving from centuries of subsequent regular [[sound change]].

The English [[cognates]] of the original name would be "[[Chapmen|chapman]]'s [[Harbor|haven]]".<ref>{{cite web|last=Nielsen|first=Oluf|year=1877|title=Kjøbenhavn i Middelalderen|url=http://www.eremit.dk/ebog/khb/1/khb1_2.html|access-date=23 November 2013|publisher=G.E.C. Gad|language=da|archive-date=19 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719122750/http://www.eremit.dk/ebog/khb/1/khb1_2.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The English ''chapman'', German {{Lang|de|Kaufmann}}, Dutch {{Lang|nl|koopman}}, Swedish {{Lang|sv|köpman}}, Danish {{Lang|da|købmand}}, and Icelandic {{Lang|is|kaupmaður}} share a derivation from Latin {{Lang|la|caupo}}, meaning 'tradesman'. However, the English term for the city was adapted from its [[Low German]] name, {{Lang|nds|Kopenhagen}}. Copenhagen's [[Swedish language|Swedish]] name is {{Lang|sv|Köpenhamn}}, a direct translation of the mutually intelligible Danish name.

The city's Latin name, {{Lang|la|Hafnia}}, is the namesake of the element [[hafnium]].<ref name="Authier2013">{{cite book|author-last=Authier|author-first=André|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ej9oAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA153|title=Early Days of X-ray Crystallography|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-163501-4|location=Oxford|page=153}}</ref>

===Early history===
Although the earliest historical records of Copenhagen are from the end of the 12th century, recent [[archaeological]] finds in connection with work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's [[Kongens Nytorv]] from {{Circa|1020}}. Excavations in [[Pilestræde]] have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century. The remains of an ancient church, with graves dating to the 11th century, have been unearthed near where [[Strøget]] meets [[Rådhuspladsen]].

These finds indicate that Copenhagen's origins as a city go back at least to the 11th century. Substantial discoveries of [[flint]] tools in the area provide evidence of human settlements dating to the [[Stone Age]].<ref>{{cite web|date=5 November 2008|title=Arkæologer graver ny teori om København op af mulden|url=http://videnskab.dk/kultur-samfund/arkaeologer-graver-ny-teori-om-kobenhavn-op-af-mulden|access-date=12 November 2013|publisher=Videnskab.dk|language=da|archive-date=25 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225012017/https://videnskab.dk/kultur-samfund/arkaeologer-graver-ny-teori-om-kobenhavn-op-af-mulden|url-status=live}}</ref> Many historians believe the town dates to the late [[Viking Age]], and was possibly founded by [[Sweyn Forkbeard|Sweyn I Forkbeard]].{{sfn|Cunningham|2013|p=35}} 
The natural harbour and good [[herring]] stocks seem to have attracted fishermen and merchants to the area on a seasonal basis from the 11th century and more permanently in the 13th century.<ref name="khdsd">{{cite web|title=København – historie|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_-_historie|access-date=12 November 2013|website=Den Store Danske|language=da|archive-date=22 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022204636/http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%C3%B8benhavn/K%C3%B8benhavn/K%C3%B8benhavn_-_historie|url-status=live}}</ref> The first habitations were probably centred on [[Gammel Strand]] (literally 'old shore') in the 11th century or even earlier.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gammel Strand|url=http://www.copenhagen.dk/dk/kulturmiljo/historier_om_kbenhavn/gammel_strand1/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20131124104344/http://www.copenhagen.dk/dk/kulturmiljo/historier_om_kbenhavn/gammel_strand1/|archive-date=24 November 2013|access-date=24 November 2013|publisher=Københavns Museum|language=da}}</ref>

The earliest written mention of the town was in the 12th century when [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in [[Gesta Danorum]] referred to it as {{Lang|la|Portus Mercatorum}}, meaning 'Merchants' Harbour' or, in the [[Danish language|Danish]] of the time, {{Lang|mis|Købmannahavn}}<!-- Old Danish -->.<ref name="metro1415">Skaarup; Jensen (2002), pp. 14–15</ref> Traditionally, Copenhagen's founding has been dated to [[Absalon|Bishop Absalon]]'s construction of a modest fortress on the little island of [[Slotsholmen]] in 1167 where [[Christiansborg Palace]] stands today.{{sfn|Davies|1944|p=365}} The construction of the fortress was in response to attacks by [[Wends|Wendish]] pirates who plagued the coastline during the 12th century.{{sfn|Harding|2009|p=38}} Defensive ramparts and moats were completed, and by 1177 St. Clemens Church had been built. Attacks by the Wends continued, and after the original fortress was eventually destroyed by the marauders, islanders replaced it with [[Copenhagen Castle]].{{Sfn|Christopher|2006|p=78}}

===Middle Ages===

In 1186, a letter from [[Pope Urban III]] states that the castle of ''Hafn'' (Copenhagen) and its surrounding lands, including the town of Hafn, were given to [[Absalon]], Bishop of Roskilde (1158–1191) and Archbishop of Lund (1177–1201), by King [[Valdemar I of Denmark|Valdemar I]]. Upon Absalon's death, the property was to come into the ownership of the [[Diocese of Roskilde (Roman-Catholic)|Bishopric of Roskilde]].<ref name=khdsd/> Around 1200, the [[Church of Our Lady (Copenhagen)|Church of Our Lady]] was constructed on higher ground to the northeast of the town, which began to develop around it.<ref name=khdsd/>

As the town became more prominent, it was repeatedly attacked by the [[Hanseatic League]]. In 1368, it was successfully invaded during the [[Second Danish-Hanseatic War]]. As the fishing industry thrived in Copenhagen, particularly in the trade of [[herring]], the city began expanding to the north of Slotsholmen.{{sfn|Harding|2009|p=38}} In 1254, it received a charter as a city under Bishop [[Jakob Erlandsen]]<ref name="Copenhagen1898">{{Cite book|last=Copenhagen|first=Dansk turistforening|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kJPVAAAAMAAJ|title=Copenhagen, the Capital of Denmark|year=1898|page=49|access-date=29 October 2015|archive-date=29 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529093640/https://books.google.com/books?id=kJPVAAAAMAAJ|url-status=live}}</ref> who garnered support from the local fishing merchants against the king by granting them special privileges.{{sfn|Booth|2003|p=9}} In the mid 1330s, the first land assessment of the city was published.{{sfn|Booth|2003|p=9}}

In disputes prior to the Reformation of 1536, the city which had been faithful to [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II]], who was Catholic, was successfully besieged in 1523 by the forces of [[Frederik I of Denmark|Frederik I]], who supported [[Lutheranism]]. Copenhagen's defences were reinforced with a series of towers along the city wall. After an extended siege from July 1535 to July 1536, during which the city supported Christian II's alliance with [[Malmö]] and [[Lübeck]], it was finally forced to capitulate to [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]]. During the second half of the century, the city prospered from increased trade across the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] supported by Dutch shipping. [[Christoffer Valkendorff]], a high-ranking statesman, defended the city's interests and contributed to its development.<ref name=khdsd/> The Netherlands had also become primarily Protestant, as were northern German states.

During the reign of [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] between 1588 and 1648, Copenhagen had dramatic growth as a city. On his initiative at the beginning of the 17th century, two important buildings were completed on [[Slotsholmen]]: the [[Tøjhus Museum|Tøjhus Arsenal]] and [[Børsen]], the stock exchange. To foster international trade, the [[Danish East India Company|East India Company]] was founded in 1616. To the east of the city, inspired by Dutch planning, the king developed the district of [[Christianshavn]] with canals and ramparts.

By 1661, Copenhagen had asserted its position as capital of Denmark and Norway. All the major institutions were located there, as was the fleet and most of the army. The defences were further enhanced with the completion of the [[Kastellet, Copenhagen|Citadel]] in 1664 and the extension of [[Christianshavns Vold]] with its bastions in 1692, leading to the creation of a new base for the fleet at [[Holmen, Copenhagen|Nyholm]].<ref name=kher/><ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Holmen|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Milit%C3%A6r/S%C3%B8v%C3%A6rnet/Holmen|language=da|access-date=23 November 2013|archive-date=30 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230053857/http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Milit%C3%A6r/S%C3%B8v%C3%A6rnet/Holmen|url-status=live}}</ref>

Copenhagen lost around 22,000 of its population of 65,000 to the [[The plague during the Great Northern War|plague]] in 1711.{{sfn|Woodward|1998|p=10}} The city was also struck by two major fires that destroyed much of its infrastructure.{{Sfn|Christopher|2006|p=78}} The [[Copenhagen Fire of 1728]] was the largest in the history of Copenhagen. It began on the evening of 20 October, and continued to burn until the morning of 23 October, destroying approximately 28% of the city, leaving some 20% of the population homeless. No less than 47% of the medieval section of the city was completely lost. Along with the [[Copenhagen fire of 1795|1795 fire]], it is the main reason that few traces of the old town can be found in the modern city.<ref>Raabyemagle, p. 16.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Lauring|first=Kåre|title=Byen brænder|pages=86–88}}</ref>

A substantial amount of rebuilding followed. In 1733, work began on the royal residence of [[Christiansborg Palace (1st)|Christiansborg Palace]], which was completed in 1745. In 1749, development of the prestigious district of [[Frederiksstaden]] was initiated.

During the 18th century, the [[Danish slave trade]], which began during the 17th century, underwent a rapid expansion. Between 1660 and 1806, Danish merchants, many of them based out of Copenhagen, transported approximately 120,000 [[Atlantic slave trade|enslaved Africans]] to the [[Danish West Indies]]. These merchants were mostly affiliated with the slave-trading [[Danish West India Company]] and [[Danish Asiatic Company]], both of which were headquartered in Copenhagen. Many buildings in Copenhagen, such as the [[Moltke Mansion]], [[Yellow Palace, Copenhagen|Yellow Palace]] and the [[Vestindisk Pakhus]] were funded with profits made from the Danish slave trade.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6PU6DQAAQBAJ&q=The+Danish+Slave+Trade+and+Its+Abolition|isbn=978-90-04-33056-6|title=The Danish Slave Trade and Its Abolition|date=7 September 2016|publisher=BRILL}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyhit.com/10-places-in-copenhagen-linked-to-colonialism/|title=10 Places in Copenhagen Linked to Colonialism}}</ref> In the second half of the 18th century, Copenhagen benefited from Denmark's neutrality during the wars between Europe's main powers, allowing it to play an important role in trade between the states around the Baltic Sea.

===19th century===

As a result of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] fears that Denmark would ally with [[French First Republic|France]], a [[Royal Navy]] fleet under the command of Admiral [[Hyde Parker (admiral)|Sir Hyde Parker]] was dispatched to neutralize the [[History of the Danish navy|Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy]]. On 2 April 1801, Parker's fleet encountered the Dano-Norwegian navy anchored near Copenhagen. Vice-Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]] led the main attack.{{Sfn|Nelson|2005|p=247}} The Dano-Norwegian fleet put up heavy resistance, and the battle is often considered to be Nelson's hardest-fought battle, surpassing even the heavy fighting at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]].{{Sfn|Pocock|1994|p=229}} It was during this battle that Lord Nelson was said to have "put the telescope to the blind eye" in order not to see Admiral Parker's signal to [[Ceasefire|cease fire]]. The British ultimately won the battle, sinking or capturing most of Dano-Norwegian fleet, which led Denmark to agree not to ally with France.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Davies|first=Peter|date=3 September 2007|title=Copenhagen's second battle remembered – 200 years on|work=The Times|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/court_and_social/article2372230.ece|access-date=13 January 2010|archive-date=29 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529104641/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/court_and_social/article2372230.ece|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1807, as a result of continued British fears that Denmark would ally with France, another British fleet led by Admiral [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|James Gambier]] was dispatched to Copenhagen with orders to seize or destroy the Dano-Norwegian navy. The British published a proclamation demanding the surrender of the Dano-Norwegian fleet, and the Danish responded with "what amounted to a declaration of war".{{Sfn|Smith|1998|p=204}} Gambier's forces responded by carrying out a naval bombardment of Copenhagen from 2 to 5 September. The bombardment, which saw the deployment of [[Congreve rocket]]s, killed 195 civilians and wounded 768, along with burning approximately 1,000 structures, including the [[Church of Our Lady, Copenhagen|Church of Our Lady]]. Copenhagen's defenders were unable to respond to the bombardment effectively due to relying on an [[Fortifications of Copenhagen|old defence-line]] whose limited range could not reach the British ships and their [[Range of a projectile|longer-range]] artillery. A British landing force of 30,000 men entered and occupied Copenhagen; during the battle, the British suffered almost 200 casualties, while the Danish suffered 3,000. Virtually the entire Dano-Norwegian fleet was surrendered to the British, who either burnt them or brought them back to Britain. Denmark declared war on Britain, leading to the outbreak of the [[Gunboat War]], which lasted until the 1814 [[Treaty of Kiel]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Glenthj̜, Rasmus|title=Experiences of war and nationality in Denmark-Norway, 1807–1815|publisher=Springer|year=2014|isbn=978-1-137-31389-8|location=New York City|oclc=912332684}}</ref><ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Københavns bombardement|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/Danmark_1536-1849/K%C3%B8benhavns_bombardement?highlight=K%C3%B8benhavns%20bombardement|language=da|access-date=15 November 2013|archive-date=10 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210144214/http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/Danmark_1536-1849/K%C3%B8benhavns_bombardement?highlight=K%C3%B8benhavns%20bombardement|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Hinde|1973|p=168}}

Despite the turmoil the Napoleonic Wars brought to the city, Copenhagen soon experienced a period of intense cultural creativity known as the [[Danish Golden Age]]. Painting prospered under [[C.W.

This dramatic increase of space was long overdue, as not only were the old ramparts out of date as a defence system but bad [[sanitation]] in the old city had to be overcome. From 1886, the west rampart ([[Vestvolden]]) was flattened, allowing major extensions to the harbour leading to the establishment of the [[Freeport of Copenhagen]] 1892–94.<ref>{{cite web|title=Københavns Havn|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%C3%B8benhavn/K%C3%B8benhavns_Havn|access-date=24 November 2013|website=Den Store Danske|language=da|archive-date=3 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403181549/http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%C3%B8benhavn/K%C3%B8benhavns_Havn|url-status=live}}</ref> Electricity came in 1892 with electric trams in 1897.

[[Denmark in World War II|In Denmark during World War II]], Copenhagen was [[Occupation of Denmark|occupied by German troops]] along with the rest of the country from 9 April 1940 until 4 May 1945. German leader [[Adolf Hitler]] hoped that Denmark would be "a model [[protectorate]]"<ref>Henning Poulsen, "Dansk Modstand og Tysk Politik" ("Danish opposition and German Politics") in ''Jyske Historiker'' 71(1995), p.10.</ref> and initially the [[Nazism|Nazi]] authorities sought to arrive at an understanding with the Danish government. The [[1943 Danish Folketing election|1943 Danish parliamentary election]] was also allowed to take place, with only the [[Communist Party of Denmark|Communist Party]] excluded. But in August 1943, after the government's collaboration with the occupation forces collapsed, several ships were sunk in Copenhagen Harbor by the [[Royal Danish Navy]] to prevent their use by the Germans.

In 1945 [[Ole Lippman]], leader of the Danish section of the [[Special Operations Executive]], invited the British [[Royal Air Force]] to assist their operations by attacking Nazi headquarters in Copenhagen.

Because of Copenhagen's northern latitude, the number of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight. There is therefore a difference of 10 hours and 31 minutes in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sol op/ned|url=http://www.torbenhermansen.dk/almanak/almanak.php#|access-date=17 November 2013|publisher=Almanak|language=da|archive-date=5 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005163031/http://www.torbenhermansen.dk/almanak/almanak.php|url-status=live}}</ref>

Copenhagen aims to be [[carbon-neutral]] by 2025. Commercial and residential buildings are to reduce electricity consumption by 20 per cent and 10 per cent respectively, and total heat consumption is to fall by 20 per cent by 2025. Renewable energy features such as solar panels are becoming increasingly common in the newest buildings in Copenhagen. [[District heating]] will be carbon-neutral by 2025, by waste [[incineration]] and biomass. New buildings must now be constructed according to Low Energy Class ratings and in 2020 near net-zero energy buildings. By 2025, 75% of trips should be made on foot, by bike, or by using public transit. The city plans that 20–30% of cars will run on electricity or [[biofuel]] by 2025. The investment is estimated at $472&nbsp;million public funds and $4.78&nbsp;billion private funds.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/12/copenhagen-push-carbon-neutral-2025 Copenhagen's ambitious push to be carbon-neutral by 2025] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215224939/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/12/copenhagen-push-carbon-neutral-2025 |date=15 February 2017 }} Guardian 12 April 2013</ref>

The city's urban planning authorities continue to take full account of these priorities. Special attention is given both to climate issues and efforts to ensure maximum application of [[Low-energy house|low-energy standards]]. Priorities include [[sustainable drainage system]]s,<ref>[http://nordvand.dk/klimatilpasning/Sider/default.aspx We make room for the rainwater] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150729044059/http://nordvand.dk/klimatilpasning/Sider/default.aspx |date=29 July 2015 }}</ref> [[Water conservation|recycling rainwater]], [[green roof]]s and efficient [[waste management]] solutions.

Shipping is another important sector with Maersk, the world's largest [[List of ship companies|shipping company]], having their world headquarters in Copenhagen.

It has the [[Amalienborg]] Palace at its centre and is dominated by the dome of [[Frederik's Church]] (or the Marble Church) and several elegant 18th-century [[Rococo]] mansions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frederiksstad with Amalienborg|url=http://www.verdensarv.dk/english/candidates/frederiksstad-with-amalienborg/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214204614/http://www.verdensarv.dk/english/candidates/frederiksstad-with-amalienborg/|archive-date=14 December 2013|access-date=20 November 2013|publisher=Kultur Styrelsen}}</ref> The inner city includes [[Slotsholmen]], a little island on which [[Christiansborg Palace]] stands and [[Christianshavn]] with its canals.<ref>{{cite web|title=Copenhagen city centre|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/sightseeing/copenhagen-city-centre|access-date=20 November 2013|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|archive-date=9 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109170501/http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/sightseeing/copenhagen-city-centre|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Børsen]] on Slotsholmen and [[Frederiksborg Palace]] in Hillerød are prominent examples of the [[Dutch Renaissance]] style in Copenhagen. Around the historical city centre lies a band of congenial residential boroughs ([[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]], [[Nørrebro|Inner Nørrebro]], [[Indre Østerbro|Inner Østerbro]]) dating mainly from late 19th century. They were built outside the old ramparts when the city was finally allowed to expand beyond its fortifications.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lidt Nørrebro-historie|url=http://www.noerrebrolokalhistorie.dk/historie.php|access-date=21 November 2013|publisher=Nørrebro Lokalhistoriske Forening og Arkiv|language=da|archive-date=5 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181005160238/http://noerrebrolokalhistorie.dk/historie.php|url-status=live}}</ref>

Sometimes referred to as "the City of Spires", Copenhagen is known for its horizontal skyline, broken only by the spires and towers of its churches and castles. Most characteristic of all is the [[Baroque]] spire of the [[Church of Our Saviour, Copenhagen|Church of Our Saviour]] with its narrowing external spiral stairway that visitors can climb to the top.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Vor Frelsers Kirke (København)|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Arkitektur/Danske_kirker/Vor_Frelsers_Kirke|language=da|access-date=21 November 2013|archive-date=9 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109054559/http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Arkitektur/Danske_kirker/Vor_Frelsers_Kirke|url-status=live}}</ref> Other important spires are those of [[Christiansborg Palace]], the [[Copenhagen City Hall|City Hall]] and the former Church of St. Nikolaj that now houses a [[modern art]] venue. Not quite so high are the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] spires of [[Rosenborg Castle]] and the "dragon spire" of [[Børsen|Christian IV's former stock exchange]], so named because it resembles the intertwined tails of four dragons.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Knud Kapper Hansen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F5hqGQAACAAJ|title=Tårne, spir og kupler: om Københavns og Frederiksbergs karakteristiske tårnlandskab|publisher=Tårngruppen|year=1995|access-date=29 October 2015|archive-date=30 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530142329/https://books.google.com/books?id=F5hqGQAACAAJ|url-status=live}}</ref>

Copenhagen is recognised globally as an exemplar of best practice [[urban planning]].<ref>{{cite web|date=19 April 2015|title=A Brief History of Urban Planning in Copenhagen|url=http://www.scandinaviastandard.com/a-brief-look-at-urban-planning-in-copenhagen/|access-date=9 May 2017|website=Scandinavia Standard|archive-date=14 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514215401/http://www.scandinaviastandard.com/a-brief-look-at-urban-planning-in-copenhagen/|url-status=live}}</ref> Its thriving mixed use city centre is defined by striking contemporary architecture, engaging public spaces and an abundance of human activity. These design outcomes have been deliberately achieved through careful replanning in the second half of the 20th century.

Recent years have seen a boom in modern architecture in Copenhagen<ref name="baumeister1">{{cite web|url=http://www.baumeister.de/|title=B1 Kopenhagen entdecken|publisher=Baumeister – Zeitschrift für Architektur|year=2009|language=de|access-date=12 February 2016|archive-date=6 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210106233740/https://www.baumeister.de/|url-status=live}}</ref> both for [[Architecture of Denmark|Danish architecture]] and for works by international architects. For a few hundred years, virtually no foreign architects had worked in Copenhagen, but since the turn of the millennium the city and its immediate surroundings have seen buildings and projects designed by top international architects. British design magazine ''[[Monocle (2007 magazine)|Monocle]]'' named Copenhagen the ''World's best design city 2008''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/copenhagen-probably-the-best-city-in-the-world-842782.html|title=World's best design city 2008|work=The Independent|location=UK|first=Emily|last=Dugan|date=9 June 2008|access-date=26 August 2017|archive-date=21 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621160622/http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/copenhagen-probably-the-best-city-in-the-world-842782.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Copenhagen's urban development in the first half of the 20th century was heavily influenced by industrialisation. After World War II, Copenhagen Municipality adopted [[Fordism]] and repurposed its medieval centre to facilitate private automobile infrastructure in response to innovations in transport, trade and communication.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=New City Spaces|last=Gehl|first=Jan|publisher=Danish Architectural Press|year=2000|location=Copenhagen|page=13}}</ref> Copenhagen's spatial planning in this time frame was characterised by the separation of land uses: an approach which requires residents to travel by car to access facilities of different uses.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New City Spaces|last=Gehl|first=Jan|publisher=Danish Architectural Press|year=2000|location=Copenhagen|page=17}}</ref>

The boom in urban development and [[modern architecture]] has brought some changes to the city's skyline. A political majority has decided to keep the historical centre free of high-rise buildings, but several areas will see or have already seen massive urban development. [[Ørestad]] now has seen most of the recent development. Located near [[Copenhagen Airport]], it currently boasts one of the largest malls in Scandinavia and a variety of office and residential buildings as well as the [[IT University of Copenhagen|IT University]] and a high school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orestad.dk/~/media/Orestad/pdf/Copenhagen-Growing_web.ashx|title=Copenhagen growing|publisher=By&Havn|access-date=21 November 2013|archive-date=26 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326183136/http://www.orestad.dk/~/media/Orestad/pdf/Copenhagen-Growing_web.ashx|url-status=live}}</ref>

In Copenhagen, many [[cemetery|cemeteries]] double as parks, though only for the more quiet activities such as sunbathing, reading and meditation. [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Cemetery]], the burial place of [[Hans Christian Andersen]], is an important green space for the district of [[Nørrebro|Inner Nørrebro]] and a Copenhagen institution. The lesser known [[Vestre Cemetery|Vestre Kirkegaard]] is the largest cemetery in Denmark ({{convert|54|ha|abbr=on}}) and offers a maze of dense groves, open lawns, winding paths, hedges, overgrown tombs, monuments, tree-lined avenues, lakes and other [[List of garden features|garden feature]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kk.dk/da/brugbyen/brug-steder-i-byen/groenne-omraader/kirkegaarde|title=Kirkegårde|publisher=Københavns Kommune|language=da|access-date=21 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023034448/http://www.kk.dk/da/brugbyen/brug-steder-i-byen/groenne-omraader/kirkegaarde|archive-date=23 October 2013}}</ref>

===Landmarks by district===

====Indre By====
The historic centre of the city, [[Indre By]] or the Inner City, features many of Copenhagen's most popular monuments and attractions. The area known as [[Frederiksstaden]], developed by [[Frederik V of Denmark|Frederik V]] in the second half of the 18th century in the [[Rococo]] style, has the four mansions of [[Amalienborg]], the royal residence, and the wide-domed [[Frederik's Church|Marble Church]] at its centre.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/K%C3%B8benhavns_historie/Frederiksstaden|title=Frederiksstaden|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|access-date=27 November 2013|language=da|archive-date=30 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230003224/http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/K%C3%B8benhavns_historie/Frederiksstaden|url-status=live}}</ref> Directly across the water from Amalienborg, the 21st-century [[Copenhagen Opera House]] stands on the island of [[Holmen, Copenhagen|Holmen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faktalink.dk/titelliste/open|author1=Charlotte Haase|author2=Susanne Nørgaard|title=Operaen|publisher=Faktalink|access-date=27 November 2013|language=da|archive-date=2 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230718/http://www.faktalink.dk/titelliste/open|url-status=live}}</ref> To the south of Frederiksstaden, the [[Nyhavn]] canal is lined with colourful houses from the 17th and 18th centuries, many now with lively restaurants and bars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenet.dk/cph-map/cph-nyhavn.asp|title=Nyhavn|publisher=Copenhagenet.dk|access-date=27 November 2013|archive-date=2 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222200/http://www.copenhagenet.dk/cph-map/cph-nyhavn.asp|url-status=live}}</ref> The canal runs from the harbour front to the spacious square of [[Kongens Nytorv]] which was laid out by [[Christian V]] in 1670.

====Christianshavn====
[[File:Christianshavns Kanal boats.jpg|thumb|Christianshavn Canal]]
[[Christianshavn]] lies to the southeast of [[Indre By]] on the other side of the harbour. The area was developed by [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] in the early 17th century. Impressed by the city of [[Amsterdam]], he employed Dutch architects to create canals within its [[Christianshavns Vold|ramparts]] which are still well preserved today.<ref name=kher/> The canals themselves, branching off the central [[Christianshavns Kanal|Christianshavn Canal]] and lined with house boats and pleasure craft are one of the area's attractions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.travtasy.com/2018/04/copenhagen-itinerary-5-days-denmark.html|title=5 Days in Copenhagen Itinerary & What To Do|access-date=15 September 2019|archive-date=9 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209055805/https://www.travtasy.com/2018/04/copenhagen-itinerary-5-days-denmark.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Another interesting feature is [[Freetown Christiania]], a fairly large area which was initially occupied by squatters during student unrest in 1971.

Other buildings of interest in Christianshavn include the [[Church of Our Saviour, Copenhagen|Church of Our Saviour]] with its spiralling steeple and the magnificent Rococo [[Christian's Church, Copenhagen|Christian's Church]].

[[File:Nørrebrogade - beginning.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dronning Louises Bro]] leading into [[Nørrebrogade]]]]
[[Nørrebro]] to the northwest of the city centre has recently developed from a working-class district into a colourful cosmopolitan area with antique shops, non-Danish food stores and restaurants. Much of the activity is centred on [[Sankt Hans Torv]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aok.dk/byliv/guide-to-noerrebro|title=Guide to: Nørrebro|publisher=AOK|access-date=28 November 2013|archive-date=3 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203205956/http://www.aok.dk/byliv/guide-to-noerrebro|url-status=live}}</ref> and around [[Rantzausgade]]. Copenhagen's historic cemetery, [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Kirkegård]] halfway up Nørrebrogade, is the resting place of many famous figures including [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Niels Bohr]], and [[Hans Christian Andersen]] but is also used by locals as a park and recreation area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kk.dk/da/brugbyen/brug-steder-i-byen/groenne-omraader/kirkegaarde/assistens-kirkegaard|title=Assistens Kirkegård|publisher=Københavns Kommune|access-date=28 November 2013|language=da|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023051043/http://www.kk.dk/da/brugbyen/brug-steder-i-byen/groenne-omraader/kirkegaarde/assistens-kirkegaard|archive-date=23 October 2013}}</ref>

Apart from the selection of upmarket restaurants, Copenhagen offers a great variety of Danish, ethnic and experimental restaurants. It is possible to find modest eateries serving [[open sandwich]]es, known as [[smørrebrød]] – a traditional, Danish lunch dish; however, most restaurants serve international dishes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/gastronomy/top-10-traditional-danish-lunch|title=Top 10 traditional Danish lunch|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|access-date=22 November 2013|archive-date=11 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211211742/http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/gastronomy/top-10-traditional-danish-lunch|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Danish pastry]] can be sampled from any of numerous bakeries found in all parts of the city.

Copenhagen has long been associated with beer. [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] beer has been brewed at the brewery's premises on the border between the [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]] and [[Valby]] districts since 1847 and has long been almost synonymous with [[Beer in Denmark|Danish beer]] production. However, recent years have seen an explosive growth in the number of [[microbrewery|microbreweries]] so that Denmark today has more than 100 breweries, many of which are located in Copenhagen. Some like Nørrebro Bryghus also act as [[brewpubs]] where it is also possible to eat on the premises.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dev-bryggeriforeningen.dk/default.asp?pid=191&show=12|title=Nyeste artikler fra Bryggeriforeningen|publisher=Dev-bryggeriforeningen.dk|language=da|access-date=9 March 2013|archive-date=15 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015195045/http://www.dev-bryggeriforeningen.dk/default.asp?pid=191&show=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/nightlife/top-10-beer|title=Top 10 beer|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|access-date=22 November 2013|archive-date=11 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211211838/http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/nightlife/top-10-beer|url-status=live}}</ref>
