'''Chemnitz''' ({{IPA|de|ˈkɛmnɪts|lang|De-Chemnitz.ogg}}; from 1953 to 1990: '''Karl-Marx-Stadt''' {{IPA|de|kaʁlˈmaʁksˌʃtat||De-Karl-Marx-Stadt.ogg}}, {{lit|[[Karl Marx]] City}}) is the third-largest city in the [[Germany|German]] [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Saxony]] after [[Leipzig]] and [[Dresden]]. Chemnitz is the third-largest city in the [[Thuringian]]-[[Upper Saxon]] dialect area after Leipzig and Dresden. It is the fifth largest city in the area of former [[East Germany]] after ([[East Berlin|East]]) [[Berlin]], Leipzig, Dresden and [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]]. The city is part of the [[Central German Metropolitan Region]], and lies in the middle of a string of cities sitting in the densely populated northern [[Ore Mountain Foreland|foreland]] of the [[Elster Mountains|Elster]] and [[Ore Mountains]], stretching from [[Plauen]] in the southwest via [[Zwickau]], Chemnitz and [[Freiberg]] to Dresden in the northeast.

Located in the [[Ore Mountain Basin]], the city is surrounded by the Ore Mountains to the south and the [[Central Saxon Hills|Central Saxon Hill Country]] to the north. The city stands on the [[Chemnitz River]], which is formed through the confluence of the rivers [[Zwönitz (river)|Zwönitz]] and [[Würschnitz]] in the borough of Altchemnitz.

The name of the city as well as the names of the rivers are of [[Polabian Slavs|Slavic]] origin. The city's economy is based on the [[tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]] and [[manufacturing|manufacturing industry]]. [[Chemnitz University of Technology]] has around 10,000 students.

Chemnitz was the richest city in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century, is known for its many industrial age buildings and monuments,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.chemnitz.travel/chemnitz-entdecken/industriekultur-geschichte | title=Industriekultur-Geschichte }}</ref> and will be the [[European Capital of Culture]] of 2025.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|title=Chemnitz: Kulturhauptstadt mit Hindernissen|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/chemnitz-kulturhauptstadt-101.html|url-status=live|access-date=2021-12-21|website=tagesschau.de|language=de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210111151937/https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/chemnitz-kulturhauptstadt-101.html |archive-date=11 January 2021 }}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Chemnitz is named after the river [[Chemnitz (river)|Chemnitz]], a small tributary of the [[Zwickau Mulde]]. The word "Chemnitz" is from the [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian language]] ({{langx|hsb|Kamjenica}}), and means "stony [brook]". The word is composed of the Slavic word {{lang|sla|[[wikt:kamen|kamen]]}} meaning "stone" and the feminine suffix {{lang|sla|[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/-ica|-ica]]}}.

It is known in [[Czech language|Czech]] as {{lang|cs|Saská Kamenice}} and in [[Polish language|Polish]] as {{lang|pl|Kamienica Saska}}. There are many other towns named Kamienica or Kamenice in areas with past or present Slavic settlement.

== History ==
{{For timeline}}
[[File:Ansicht Chemnitz um 1850.jpg|thumb|right|Chemnitz by 1850]]

===Free imperial city===
An early Slavic tribe's settlement was located at {{lang|sla|Kamienica}}, and the first documented use of this name was in 1143, as the location of a [[Benedictine]] monastery around which a settlement grew. Around 1170, [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor]] granted this the rights of a [[free imperial city]]. Kamienica was later Germanised as Chemnitz.

===Meissen and Saxony===
In 1307, the town became subordinate to the [[Margraviate of Meissen]], the predecessor of the Saxon state. In [[Middle Ages|medieval times]], Chemnitz became a centre of textile production and trade. More than one third of the population worked in textile production. In 1356 the Margraviate was succeeded by the [[Electorate of Saxony]].

Geologist [[Georgius Agricola]] (1494-1555), author of several significant works on mining and [[metallurgy]] including the landmark treatise [[De re metallica|''De Re Metallica'']], became [[city physician]] of Chemnitz in 1533 and lived here until his death in 1555. In 1546 he was elected a Burgher of Chemnitz and in the same year also was appointed Burgomaster (lord mayor), serving again in 1547, 1551, and 1553. In spite of having been a leading citizen of the city, when Agricola died in 1555 the Protestant Duke denied him burial in the city's cathedral due to Agricola's allegiance to his Roman Catholic faith. Agricola's friends arranged for his remains to be buried in more sympathetic [[Zeitz]], approximately 50&nbsp;km away.<ref>Agricola, Georgius. De re metallica. Translation by Hoover, Herbert Clark and Hoover, Lou Henry, 1912, reprinted by Dover Publications, New York, 1950, pp. vi-xii.</ref> Chemnitz became a famous trading and textile manufacturing town.

In 1806, with the end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the Electorate was renamed as the [[Kingdom of Saxony]], and this survived until the revolutions of 1918 which followed the Armistice ending the [[World War I|First World War]].

By the early 19th century, Chemnitz had become an industrial centre (sometimes called "the Saxon [[Manchester]]", {{langx|de|Sächsisches Manchester}}, {{IPA|de|ˈzɛksɪʃəs ˈmɛntʃɛstɐ|pron|De-Sächsisches Manchester.ogg}}). Important industrial companies were founded by [[Richard Hartmann]], Louis Schönherr and Johann von Zimmermann. Chemnitz became a centre of innovation in the kingdom of Saxony and later in Germany. In 1913, Chemnitz had a population of 320,000 and, like Leipzig and Dresden, was larger at that time than today. After losing inhabitants due to the [[First World War]] Chemnitz grew rapidly again and reached its all-time peak of 360,250 inhabitants in 1930. Thereafter, growth was stalled by the [[Great Depression|world economic crisis]].

===Weimar Republic===
{{See also|Saxony in the German Revolution (1918–1919)}}
As a working-class industrial city, Chemnitz was a powerful center of socialist political organization after the First World War. At the foundation of the German Communist Party the local [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] voted by 1,000 votes to three to break from the party and join the Communist Party behind their local leaders, [[Fritz Heckert]] and [[Heinrich Brandler]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Broué |first1=Pierre |title=The German Revolution: 1917 - 1923 |year=2006 |publisher=Haymarket Books |isbn=1-931859-32-9 |page=305}}</ref> In March 1919 the German Communist Party had over 10,000 members in the
city of Chemnitz.<ref>W. Berthold, 'Die Kämpfeti der Chemnitzer Arbeiter gegen die militaristiche Reaktion im August 1919', Beiträge zur Geschichte der deutschen Arbeiterbewegung, no. 1, 1962,
p. 127.</ref> Chemnitz was one of the big German industrial centers. Due to the export traffic a modern marshalling yard was erected 1929 in Chemnitz-Hilbersdorf. At that time it was a leading city in the European textile market. [[Auto Union]] (today Audi) was founded 1932 in Chemnitz.

===World War II===
Allied bombing destroyed 41 per cent of the built-up area of Chemnitz during the [[Second World War]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/worldwar2/theatres-of-war/western-europe/investigation/hamburg/sources/docs/6/ |title=Western Europe 1939–1945: Hamburg - Why did the RAF bomb cities? |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |access-date=2 November 2017 |archive-date=17 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210417095617/https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/worldwar2/theatres-of-war/western-europe/investigation/hamburg/sources/docs/6/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Chemnitz contained factories that produced military hardware and a [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenbürg]] [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labor]] subcamp (500 female inmates) for [[Astra-Werke AG]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Victor |first=Edward |title=Chemnitz, Germany |url=http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/Chemnitz_Germany.htm |access-date=23 March 2009 |archive-date=30 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230113211/http://edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/Chemnitz_Germany.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[oil refinery]] was a target for bombers during the [[Oil Campaign of World War II]], and [[Thunderclap plan|Operation Thunderclap]] attacks included the following raids:

* '''5 March''': 760 RAF bombers attacked.
The city was occupied by Soviet troops on 8 May 1945. 

The headquarters of the auto manufacturer [[Auto Union]] was based in Chemnitz from 1932 and its buildings were badly damaged. At the end of the war, the company's executives fled and relocated the company in [[Ingolstadt]], Bavaria, where it evolved into [[Audi]], now a brand within the Volkswagen group.

The World War II bombings left most of the city centre in ruins and [[post-war]], the East German reconstruction included large low-rise (and later high-rise {{lang|de|[[Plattenbau]]}}) housing. Some tourist sites were reconstructed during the [[East Germany|East German]] era and after [[Die Wende|German reunification]]. Today over 50 % of the city´s buildings date back to before 1950.<ref>https://zensus2011.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/Aufsaetze_Archiv/2015_12_NI_GWZ_endgueltig.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4 {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2024}}</ref>

===GDR===

After the dissolution of the Länder (states) in the GDR in 1952, Chemnitz became seat of a district ({{lang|de|Bezirk}}). On 10 May 1953, the city was renamed by decision of the East German government to {{lang|de|Karl-Marx-Stadt|italic=no}} (German: ''Karl Marx City'') after [[Karl Marx]], in recognition of its industrial heritage and the [[Karl Marx Year]] marking the 135th anniversary of his birth and the 70th anniversary of his death.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T2mgAAAAMAAJ|title=Travel Guide, German Democratic Republic|date=1983|publisher=Zeit im Bild Publishing House|location=[[Dresden]]|pages=89|quote="The town...was renamed Karl-Marx-Stadt in 1953 to commemorate the 135th anniversary of the birth and 70th anniversary of the death of...Karl Marx"}}</ref> [[Leadership of East Germany|GDR Prime Minister]] [[Otto Grotewohl]] said:

{{blockquote|The people who live here do not look back, but look forward to a new and better future. They look at socialism. They look with love and devotion to the founder of the socialist doctrine, the greatest son of the German people, to Karl Marx. I hereby fulfill the government's decision.

After the city centre was destroyed in [[World War II]], the East German authorities attempted to rebuild it to symbolise the conceptions of urban development of a socialist city. The layout of the city centre at that time was rejected in favour of a new road network. However, the original plans were not completed. In addition, the rapid development of housing took priority over the preservation of old buildings. So in the 1960s and 1970s, both in the centre as well as the periphery, large areas were built in {{lang|de|[[Plattenbau]]|italic=no}} apartment-block style, for example {{lang|de|Yorckstraße|italic=no}}. The old buildings of the period, which still existed especially in the [[Chemnitz-Kaßberg|Kassberg]], {{Ill|Chemnitz-Sonnenberg|de}} and {{Ill|Chemnitz-Schloßchemnitz|de}} quarters, were neglected and fell increasingly into dereliction.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===After reunification===

[[File:Altes Rathaus und Siegertsches Haus am Marktplatz in Chemnitz, 2015.jpg|thumb|The restored market of Chemnitz]]
On 23 April 1990, a referendum on the future name of the city was held: 76% of the voters voted for the old name "{{lang|de|Chemnitz|italic=no}}". On 1 June 1990, the city was officially renamed.<ref>"East Germany invited to join EC Dublin summit", ''[[The Times]]'' page 9, 2 June 1990</ref>

After the [[reunification of Germany]] on 3 October 1990, the city of Chemnitz faced several difficult tasks. Many inhabitants migrated to the former West Germany and unemployment in the region increased sharply; in addition Chemnitz did not have adequate shopping facilities, but this was increasingly demanded.<ref name="PROM_BERGMANN">[http://www.uni-weimar.de/ifeu/de/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=188&Itemid=186 "Kurzfassung zur Promotion des Dipl.-Pol. Alexander Bergmann zur Thematik 'Deutschlands jüngste Innenstadt – Rekonstruktion in Chemnitz verstehen'"]</ref> Large shopping centers were constructed on the city periphery to the early 1990s.

Chemnitz is the only major German city whose centre was re-planned after 1990, similar to the reconstruction of several other German cities in the immediate post-war years. Plans for the recovery of a compressed city centre around the historic town hall in 1991 led to an urban design competition. This was announced internationally by the city and carried out with the help of the partner city of {{lang|de|[[Düsseldorf]]|italic=no}}. The mooted project on an essentially unused area of the former city would be comparable in circumference with the {{lang|de|[[Potsdamer Platz]]|italic=no}} in Berlin.<ref name="PROM_BERGMANN"/>

Numerous internationally renowned architects such as {{lang|de|[[Hans Kollhoff]]|italic=no}}, {{lang|de|[[Helmut Jahn]]|italic=no}} and {{lang|de|Christoph Ingenhoven|italic=no}} provided designs for a new city centre. The mid-1990s began the development of the inner city brownfield around the town hall to a new town. In Chemnitz city more than 66,000 square meters of retail space have emerged. With the construction of office and commercial building on the construction site "B3" at the {{lang|de|Düsseldorf|italic=no}} court, the last gap in 2010 was closed in city centre image. The intensive development included demolition of partially historically valuable buildings from the period and was controversial.<ref>{{lang|de|[[Dankwart Guratzsch]]: "[https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article214825/Einer_Stadt_die_Zaehne_herausgebrochen.html Einer Stadt die Zähne herausgebrochen]", ''[[Die Welt]]''|italic=unset}}, 12 May 2006.</ref><ref>{{lang|de|Gudrun Müller: "Der Abrissrausch ist tödlich für Chemnitz", ''[[Freie Presse (Saxony)|Freie Presse]]''|italic=unset}}, 7 December 2006.</ref> Between 1990 and 2007 more than 250 buildings were leveled.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}
[[File:WirSindMehr2018-FeineSahneFischfilet-22.jpg|thumb|left|Chemnitz during the Wir sind Mehr concert in September 2018]]
In late August 2018 the city was the site of a series of [[2018 Chemnitz protests|protests]] that attracted at least 8,000 people. The protests were attended by [[Far-right politics|far-right]] and [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] groups. News outlets reported about mob violence and riots. The protests started after two immigrants from the Middle East were arrested in connection with the murder of Daniel H., a 35 year old German man, the son of a German mother and a Cuban father, which had happened on 26 August. Violent clashes occurred between far-right protesters and far-left counter protesters, leading to injuries. The mobs outnumbered the local police presence. There were reports that rightist protesters chased down dark skinned bystanders and those that appeared to be foreigners on the streets before more police arrived and intervened. The riots were widely condemned by media outlets and politicians throughout Germany, and were "described as reminiscent of civil war and Nazi pogroms."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/world/europe/germany-neo-nazi-protests-chemnitz.html?imp_id=754469853|title=Chemnitz Protests Show New Strength of Germany's Far Right|newspaper=The New York Times|date=31 August 2018|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en|last1=Bennhold|first1=Katrin|archive-date=1 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180901003755/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/world/europe/germany-neo-nazi-protests-chemnitz.html?imp_id=754469853|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/world/europe/chemnitz-protest-germany.html|title=German Far Right and Counterprotesters Clash in Chemnitz|newspaper=The New York Times|date=28 August 2018|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en|last1=Eddy|first1=Melissa|archive-date=2 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180902045328/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/world/europe/chemnitz-protest-germany.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/28/german-police-criticised-as-country-reels-from-far-right-violence|title=German police criticised as country reels from far-right violence|last=Connolly|first=Kate|date=2018-08-28|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04|archive-date=8 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190208040020/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/28/german-police-criticised-as-country-reels-from-far-right-violence|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/germany-weekend-of-riots-as-thousands-clash-at-far-right-march-in-chemnitz-whsbc87sh|title=Germany: Weekend of riots as thousands clash at far-right march in Chemnitz|last=Times|first=Oliver Moody, Berlin {{!}} The|date=2018-09-02|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en|issn=0956-1382|archive-date=4 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904161925/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/germany-weekend-of-riots-as-thousands-clash-at-far-right-march-in-chemnitz-whsbc87sh|url-status=live}}</ref>

The reports of mob violence and riots were criticized as incorrect later on. The German language Swiss newspaper [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]] corrected its earlier reports, stating that there had evidently been no mob violence but there have been sporadic encroachments.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzz.ch/international/das-deutsche-staatsoberhaupt-wirbt-fuer-die-band-feine-sahne-fischfilet-eine-instinktlosigkeit-ld.1416765|title=Original wording: "Es gab, nach allem, was man weiss, lediglich vereinzelte Übergriffe, aber keine grossangelegte Menschenjagd (auch die NZZ hat hierüber zunächst in unzutreffender Weise berichtet)."|date=2018-09-03|newspaper=Neue Zürcher Zeitung|language=de|access-date=2018-09-05|archive-date=5 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905214913/https://www.nzz.ch/international/das-deutsche-staatsoberhaupt-wirbt-fuer-die-band-feine-sahne-fischfilet-eine-instinktlosigkeit-ld.1416765|url-status=live |last1=Serrao |first1=Marc Felix }}</ref> Minister President of Saxony Michael Kretschmer came to the same conclusion: "there were no mobs and man hunts".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.freiepresse.de/nachrichten/sachsen/sachsens-ministerpraesident-kretschmer-es-gab-keinen-mob-keine-hetzjagd-artikel10304198|title=Sachsens Ministerpräsident Kretschmer: "Es gab keinen Mob, keine Hetzjagd" - Freie Presse - Sachsen|access-date=5 September 2018|archive-date=5 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905153856/https://www.freiepresse.de/nachrichten/sachsen/sachsens-ministerpraesident-kretschmer-es-gab-keinen-mob-keine-hetzjagd-artikel10304198|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Theater Chemnitz]] offers a variety of theatre: opera (opera house from 1909), plays, ballet and {{lang|de|Figuren}} (puppets), and runs concerts by the orchestra Robert-Schumann-Philharmonie (founded 1832).

Tourist sights include the Kassberg neighborhood with 18th and 19th century buildings and the [[Karl Marx Monument]] by [[Lev Kerbel]], nicknamed {{lang|sxu|Nischel}} (a [[Upper Saxon German|Saxon dialect]] word for head) by the locals. Landmarks include the Old Town Hall with its Renaissance portal (15th century), the castle on the site of the former monastery, and the area around the [[Theater Chemnitz|opera house]] and the old university. The most conspicuous landmark is the red tower built in the late 12th or early 13th century as part of the [[defensive wall|city wall]].

The [[Chemnitz petrified forest]] is located in the courtyard of [[Kulturkaufhaus Tietz]]. It is one of the very few in existence, and dates back several million years (details shown in the Museum of Natural Sciences "Museum für Naturkunde Chemnitz", founded 1859). Also within the city limits, in the district of Rabenstein, is the smallest castle in Saxony, [[Rabenstein Castle (Saxony)|Rabenstein Castle]].

The city has changed considerably since German reunification. Most of its industry is now gone and the core of the city has been rebuilt with many shops as well as huge shopping centres. Many of these shops are international brands, including [[Zara (retailer)|Zara]], [[H&M]], Esprit, {{lang|de|Galeria Kaufhof|italic=no}}, Leiser Shoes, and Peek & Cloppenburg. The large {{lang|de|Galerie Roter Turm}} (Red Tower) shopping centre is very popular with young people.

The Chemnitz Industrial Museum is an Anchor Point of ERIH, the [[European Route of Industrial Heritage]]. Additional unique industrial monuments are located at the "Schauplatz Eisenbahn" ([[Saxon Railway Museum]] and Museum of Technology Cable Running System) in Chemnitz-Hilbersdorf. The State Museum of Archaeology Chemnitz<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smac.sachsen.de/en/index.html|title=Staatliches Museum für Archäologie Chemnitz|first=Staatliches Museum für Archäologie|last=Chemnitz|website=www.smac.sachsen.de|access-date=2 March 2018|archive-date=3 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303050506/https://www.smac.sachsen.de/en/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref> opened in 2014 and is located in the former [[Schocken Department Stores]] (architect: Erich Mendelsohn; opening of the department store: 1930).

The {{lang|de|[[Museum Gunzenhauser]]|italic=no}}, formerly a bank, opened on 1 December 2007. {{lang|de|Alfred Gunzenhauser|italic=no}}, who lived in Munich, had a collection of some 2,500 pieces of [[modern art]], including many paintings and drawings by {{lang|de|[[Otto Dix]]|italic=no}}, {{lang|de|[[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]]|italic=no}} and others. 
The other great art museum in Chemnitz is located near central railway station, it is called "Museum am Theaterplatz" (erected 1909 as "König-Albert-Museum"). 
The {{lang|de|[[Botanischer Garten Chemnitz]]|italic=no}} is a municipal [[botanical garden]], and the {{lang|de|[[Arktisch-Alpiner Garten der Walter-Meusel-Stiftung]]|italic=no}} is a non-profit garden specializing in [[arctic]] and [[alpine plant]]s.
Near the city center is the "Villa Esche" located (Henry-van-de-Velde-museum). This historical house was built in 1902 in art-nouveau-style by van de Velde.

The City is home of the SCHLINGEL International Film Festival, a yearly festival created in 1996 and that focuses on cinema for young audiences.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Chemnitz |first=City of |title=SCHLINGEL International Film Festival |url=http://www.chemnitz.de/chemnitz/en/culture/highlights/international-film-festival-schlingel/index.html |access-date=2024-01-19 |website=City of Chemnitz |language=en}}</ref>

== Administrative divisions ==
The city of Chemnitz consists of 39 neighborhoods. The neighborhoods of Einsiedel, Euba, Grüna, Klaffenbach, Kleinolbersdorf-Altenhain, Mittelbach, Röhrsdorf and Wittgensdorf are at the same time localities within the meaning of Sections 65 to 68 of the Saxon Municipal Code. These neighborhoods came in the wake of the last incorporation wave after 1990 as formerly independent municipalities to the city of Chemnitz and therefore enjoy this special position compared to the other parts of the city. These localities each have a local council, which, depending on the number of inhabitants of the locality concerned, comprises between ten and sixteen members as well as a chairman of the same. The local councils are to hear important matters concerning the locality. A final decision is, however, incumbent on the city council of the city of Chemnitz.<ref name=Hauptsatzung>{{cite web |title=Hauptsatzung der Stadt Chemnitz |url=http://www.chemnitz.de/chemnitz/de/buerger_und_rathaus/satzungen/downloads/10_100.pdf |publisher=Hauptsatzung der Stadt Chemnitz |access-date=2019-08-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229115709/http://www.chemnitz.de/chemnitz/de/buerger_und_rathaus/satzungen/downloads/10_100.pdf |archive-date=2010-12-29 }} (PDF; 75&nbsp;KB)</ref> The official identification of the districts by numbers is based on the following principle: Starting from the city center (neighborhoods Zentrum and Schloßchemnitz), all other parts of the city are assigned clockwise in ascending order the tenth place of their index, the one-digit is awarded in the direction of city periphery in ascending order.

The city area does not include a unified, closed settlement area after numerous incorporations. The rural settlements of mainly eastern districts are separated from the settlement area of the Chemnitz city center, whereas this partly continues over the western city limits to Limbach-Oberfrohna and Hohenstein-Ernstthal.

The mayor was originally chosen by the city council, but since 1994 has been directly elected. [[Peter Seifert]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) served from 1993 until 2006. Between 2006 and 2020 [[Barbara Ludwig]] (SPD) has served as mayor. Sven Schulze (SPD) was elected mayor in 2020.<ref name=mayor/>

== Urban renewal ==
[[File:Chemnitz Stadtzentrum vom Kaßberg 2014.jpg|thumb|Downtown Chemnitz in 2014]]

Heavy destruction in World War II as well as post-war demolition to erect a truly socialist city centre left the city with a vast open space around its [[city and town halls|town hall]] where once a vibrant city heart had been. Because of massive investment in out-of-town shopping right after reunification, it was not until 1999 that major building activity was started in the centre. Comparable to {{lang|de|[[Potsdamer Platz]]|italic=no}} in Berlin, a whole new quarter of the city was constructed in recent years. New buildings include the {{lang|de|Kaufhof|italic=no}} [[department store]] by {{lang|de|[[Helmut Jahn]]|italic=no}}, {{lang|de|Galerie Roter Turm|italic=no}} with a façade by {{lang|de|[[Hans Kollhoff]]|italic=no}} and Peek & Cloppenburg clothing store by {{lang|de|Ingenhofen|italic=no}} and Partner.

== Economy ==
Chemnitz is the largest city of the {{lang|de|Chemnitz-Zwickau|italic=no}} urban area and is one of the most important economic areas of Germany's new federal states. Chemnitz had a GDP of €8.456 billion in 2016, with GDP per capita at €34,166.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statistik-bw.de/VGRdL/tbls/index.jsp?lang=#tab03|title=Aktuelle Ergebnisse – VGR dL|last=Baden-Württemberg|first=Statistisches Landesamt|website=www.statistik-bw.de|language=de|access-date=2018-09-08|archive-date=13 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190213033332/https://www.statistik-bw.de/VGRdL/tbls/index.jsp?lang=#tab03|url-status=dead}}</ref> Since about 2000, the city's economy has recorded high annual [[Economic growth|GDP growth]] rates; Chemnitz is among the top ten German cities in terms of growth rate. The local and regional economic structure is characterized by medium-sized companies, with the heavy industrial sectors of mechanical engineering, metal processing, and vehicle manufacturing as the most significant industries.

About 100,000 people are employed, of whom about 46,000 commute from other municipalities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spd-mueller.de/index.php?Objekt=System&Aktion=seite&menuid=18&PHPSESSID=016c5251ce356b84b6aeed63e0d89436 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928224854/http://www.spd-mueller.de/index.php?Objekt=System&Aktion=seite&menuid=18&PHPSESSID=016c5251ce356b84b6aeed63e0d89436 |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 September 2007 |title=Detlef Müller |date=28 September 2007 }}</ref> 16.3% of employees in Chemnitz have a university or [[academic degree|college degree]], twice the average rate in Germany.

[[File:Einwohnerentwicklung von Chemnitz.svg|thumb|400px|Chemnitz's population since 1466]]
Chemnitz has a population of 246,000 people and is the 3rd largest city in [[Saxony]]. The population of Chemnitz grow rapidly since the early 1900s due to its industrialization. Chemnitz reached its highest peak of population in 1930 with population of about 362,000. Chemnitz in the [[East Germany]] era when the city was called "Karl-Marx-Stadt", it became a significant industrial city known for it textile and leather industries. Chemnitz was also the 4th largest city in then East Germany after [[East Berlin]], [[Leipzig]] and [[Dresden]]. After the [[German Reunification]] Chemnitz faced a significant population decrease. Since 1988 Chemnitz has lost about 20 percent of its inhabitants. Chemnitz's population decreased from 300,000 in 1989 to under 250,000 in 2003, which made Chemnitz one of the cities with most population loss in Germany. Chemnitz's population started to grow again in the 2010s due to its immigration from mostly war active countries like Syria but it faced a problem due to many right-wing extremists and active [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] groups where many foreigners experience racism and moved away from Chemnitz. The city had a fertility rate of 1.64 in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |title=Statistisches Jahrbuch 2015/2016 |url=https://www.chemnitz.de/chemnitz/media/aktuell/publikationen/downloads/jahrbuch_15_16.pdf |publisher=chemnitz.de |language=de |date=29 June 2017 |access-date=17 June 2019 |archive-date=17 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617122348/https://www.chemnitz.de/chemnitz/media/aktuell/publikationen/downloads/jahrbuch_15_16.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>
