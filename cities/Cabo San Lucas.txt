'''Cabo San Lucas''' ({{IPA|es|ˈkaβo san ˈlukas}}, "[[Luke the Evangelist|Saint Luke]] [[Cape (geography)|Cape]]"), also known simply as '''Cabo''', is a [[Resort town|resort city]] at the southern tip of the [[Baja California peninsula]], in the Mexican [[Political divisions of Mexico|state]] of [[Baja California Sur]]. As of the 2020 Census, the population of the city was 202,694.<ref name="saludbcs.gob.mx"/><ref name="2020 Census of Mexico">2020 Census of Mexico.</ref> Cabo San Lucas, together with the famous [[San José del Cabo]] are collectively known as [[Los Cabos]]. Together, they form a [[metropolitan area]] of 351,111 inhabitants.<ref name="saludbcs.gob.mx"/><ref name="2020 Census of Mexico">2020 Census of Mexico.</ref>

Rated as one of Mexico's top tourist destinations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tripadvisor.com/TravelersChoice-Destinations-cTop-g150768|title=Best Destinations in Mexico - Travelers' Choice Awards - TripAdvisor}}</ref> Cabo San Lucas is known for its beaches, [[scuba diving]] locations, [[Balneario]]s, the sea arch [[El Arco de Cabo San Lucas]], and marine life. The [[Los Cabos Corridor]] has become a heavily trafficked [[Tourism|vacation]] destination for tourists, with numerous [[resort]]s and [[timeshare]]s along the coast between Cabo San Lucas and San José del Cabo.

The waters around Cabo are home to marine wildlife including [[Batoidea|rays]], [[shark]]s, [[mahi-mahi]] (dorado), and striped marlin.

==History==
[[File:California and Mexico Steamship Company line map, from- Old Mexico and her lost provinces; a journey in Mexico, southern California, and Arizona, by way of Cuba (1883) (14594814447) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Cabo San Lucas was on several steamship lines in the 1880s.]]
Archaeological excavations have shown evidence of continual human habitation in the area for at least 10,000 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.innerexplorations.com/bajatext/an.htm|title=An Interview with Harumi Fujita on the Archaeology of Baja California Sur}}</ref> When the first Europeans arrived, they encountered the [[Pericú]] people, who survived on a subsistence diet based on hunting and gathering [[seed]]s, [[root]]s, [[shellfish]], and other marine resources. They called the location ''Yenecamú''.

According to the narrative of Hatsutaro, a Japanese castaway, in the book ''[[Kaigai Ibun]]'' (written by Maekawa, Junzo, and Bunzo Sakai and narrated by Hatsutaro), when he arrived at Cabo San Lucas in May 1842, there were only two houses and about 20 inhabitants. However, American authors such as Henry Edwards and [[John Ross Browne]] claim that Cabo San Lucas's founder was an Englishman named Thomas "Old Tom" Ritchie. John Ross Browne says Ritchie arrived there about 1828, while Edwards says that he died in October 1874. The actual founder of Cabo San Lucas was Cipriano Ceseña in 1788 who arrived from Hermosillo, Sonora. Per The book by Pablo L. Martinez, Guia Familiar de Baja California, 1700–1900.

A fishing village began growing in the area. In 1917, an [[United States|American]] company built a floating platform to catch [[tuna]], and ten years later founded Compañía de Productos Marinos S.A. The plant operated for several years.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Tourism==
[[File:Cabo San Lucas Los Arcos 3.jpg|thumb|El Arco de Cabo San Lucas]]
Cabo San Lucas has become a prominent vacation and spa destination, with a variety of sites of interest and timeshares that have been built on the coast between San Lucas and [[San José del Cabo]]. The distinctive [[El Arco de Cabo San Lucas|Arco de Cabo San Lucas]] is a local landmark at Lands End.

Cabo San Lucas has the highest-paying [[big-game fishing|marlin tournament]] in the world, the Bisbee's Los Cabos Offshore. This tournament takes place every year in the month of October.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bisbees.com/|title=Home Page - Bisbees.com|website=www.bisbees.com|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref>

In the winter, pods of whales can be observed in the area. They bear their calves in the warm waters of the [[Gulf of California]] after traveling up to {{convert|10000|km|-3}} from [[Alaska]] and [[Siberia]].

===Development===
[[File:Marina en Cabo San Lucas.JPG|thumb|left|Mall in Cabo San Lucas]]

The beaches, surfing, and [[sport fishing]] opportunities in Cabo San Lucas have attracted a great number of Mexican natives and foreigners to spend their vacations in large-scale tourist developments. The development of Cabo's tourism industry was prompted by the [[Federal government of Mexico|Mexican government]]'s development of [[infrastructure]] to turn Cabo San Lucas into a major centre for tourism in Mexico, beginning in 1974. Upon completion of the Transpeninsular Highway, also known as the [[Mexican Federal Highway 1]], tourist developments in [[Los Cabos]] proceeded relatively unchecked.

Until fairly recently,{{When|date=March 2012}} the unique and fragile environment of this part of Mexico was largely unprotected by law, and therefore was subjected to developers acting in concert with government agencies interested only in low-end tourist bonanzas. There is, however, a growing collection of activists and attorneys now involved in preserving many of Baja's desert habitats, marine mammals, and stretches of coastline. A number of agencies, including the Gulf of California Conservation Fund<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conservation.org/sites/gcf/fmg/articles/Pages/sept_07_bahia_fund.aspx|title=Error|website=www.conservation.org|access-date=2011-01-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928081619/http://www.conservation.org/sites/gcf/fmg/articles/Pages/sept_07_bahia_fund.aspx|archive-date=2011-09-28|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the Centre for Environmental Law in [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icf-xchange.org/graphics/plug?p=campaign_display_1&w=cemda|title=The Center for Environmental Law in La Paz|access-date=2011-01-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314010336/http://www.icf-xchange.org/graphics/plug?p=campaign_display_1&w=cemda|archive-date=2011-03-14|url-status=dead}}</ref> are challenging the destruction of wetlands and other ecosystems from Los Cabos to [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]]. In the face of a growing international public demand for corporate-driven ecological stewardship, higher-end resorts in the Los Cabos area are increasingly sensitive to their environmental impact and are taking initial steps to institute sustainable practices such as reducing water usage and non-recyclable trash output.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itravel-cabo.com/news.aspx?general-news&title=going-green-in-los-cabos|title=Going Green in Los Cabos}}</ref> In 2017, Los Cabos was projected to be one of the leaders in travel in Latin America, many of the developments owed to its increased accessibility with added plane routes from the US and Canada. It is expected that by 2018, 4,000 new sleeping rooms will come online in Cabo, and the increase in tourism will contribute to its growth as a leader in leisure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.travelpulse.com/news/destinations/is-los-cabos-becoming-a-luxury-leader-in-the-americas.html | title=Is Los Cabos Becoming a Luxury Leader in the Americas? | work=[[TravelPulse]]}}</ref>

=== Transportation ===
[[File:Cabo marina faro.jpeg|thumb|A sizable marina dominates the port of Cabo San Lucas.]]
Cabo San Lucas and San José del Cabo are served by [[Los Cabos International Airport]]. In 2022, Los Cabos Airport received more than 3.3 million visitors – a more than 20% projected growth when compared to 2021 and a 32% compounded growth over the last five years with 800 thousand more passengers than 2017.<ref>{{cite press release | url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/los-cabos-expected-to-close-2022-with-a-historic-20-growth-in-visitation-301680794.html | title=Travel Growth in Los Cabos}}</ref>

The town is also a popular port of call for many [[cruise ship]]s. Cabo San Lucas has a small [[Cabo San Lucas International Airport|international airfield]], which handles air traffic for general aviation flights and air taxi services.

Many tourists get around the area through the numerous local taxis that service the primary parts of Cabo, as well as the corridor and the airport. Another alternative is the bus system which is less expensive than taxis. It costs several pesos and it is mainly used by locals but also available to tourists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cabosanlucas.net/fast_facts/getting_around.php|title=Getting around in Cabo San Lucas & Los Cabos|first=Cabo San Lucas|last=Vacations|website=www.cabosanlucas.net|date=3 May 2020}}</ref> As of 2021, Uber is available as a means of transportation in the Los Cabos area.

===Nightlife and activities===
[[File:Cabo paraiso.jpeg|thumb|Puerto Paraiso, in the very center of Cabo San Lucas]]

Clubs in Cabo include the [[Cabo Wabo Cantina]], a nightclub owned by rock singer [[Sammy Hagar]], founded originally by him with other members of [[Van Halen]], named after their hit single "[[Cabo Wabo (song)|Cabo Wabo]]". There is also the [[Baja Brewing Company]]. The English-language newspaper for Cabo San Lucas, the biweekly ''[[Gringo Gazette]]'', has news on tourist activities in Cabo San Lucas, San Jose, [[Todos Santos, Baja California Sur|Todos Santos]], [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]], and the East Cape Baja.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-newspapers.com/mexico.html|title=Mexican Newspapers and News Sites}}</ref>

===Resort corridor===
{{main|Los Cabos Corridor}}
[[File:Medano lands end.jpeg|thumb|Medano is the main beach of Cabo San Lucas, pictured here with Land's End in the background.]]
[[File:CaboSanLucas ISS012-E-7151 annotated.jpg|right|thumb|upright|This view of Cabo San Lucas shows the rapid growth of the area (2005).]]

Chileno Bay is one of the most frequented beaches in the Corridor. It is home to tropical fish, sea turtles, invertebrates, and sponges. Snorkelers often visit this beach to observe underwater sea life.

==Climate==
The extreme south of [[Baja California Peninsula|Baja California]] has a [[Desert climate|tropical desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''BWh''). Even with the thermal amplitude, there are no freezes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=764051&cityname=Cabo+San+Lucas,+Baja+California+Sur,+Mexico|title=Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>

During summer, Cabo San Lucas is cooler than San José del Cabo by about {{convert|1.5|to|3|C|F}}.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Sometimes during the summer, when winds blow from the Pacific Ocean instead of the [[Gulf of California]], the differences in temperatures between San José del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas are higher.

Cabo San Lucas is less rainy than San José del Cabo, although hurricanes can bring heavy rain for long periods. [[Hurricane Odile (2014)|Hurricane Odile]] made landfall at Cabo San Lucas on 14 September 2014, and caused widespread damage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/news/weather-hurricanes/hurricane-odile-update-cabo-san-lucas-20140914|title=Hurricane Odile Timeline: Unprecedented Cyclone Leaves Widespread Damage in Cabo San Lucas, Baja California|publisher=weather.com|access-date=2014-09-17|archive-date=2014-09-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917021826/http://www.weather.com/news/weather-hurricanes/hurricane-odile-update-cabo-san-lucas-20140914|url-status=dead}}</ref> Due to the position of the city and [[orography]], local summer thunderstorms do not get near enough to bring rain to the town.

The sea temperature experiences lows of {{convert|21|-|22|°C|abbr=on}} in winter, and highs of {{convert|28|-|29|°C|abbr=on}} during the summer months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seatemperature.org/central-america/mexico/cabo-san-lucas-january.htm|title=Cabo San Lucas Sea Temperature January Average, Mexico - Sea Temperatures|first=Copyright Global Sea Temperatures - A-Connect|last=Ltd}}</ref>
