==Etymology and coat of arms==
According to early Spanish sources, the island of Cancún was originally known to its [[Maya peoples|Maya inhabitants]] as {{lang|yua|Nizuc}} ({{lang-yua|niʔ suʔuk}}), meaning either '[[Wiktionary:promontory|promontory]]' or 'point of grass'.<ref name="Andrews"/> 

The name ''Cancún'', ''Cancum'' or ''Cankun'' first appears on 18th-century maps.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cancun.gob.mx/visitantes/historia-de-la-ciudad/ |title=Government of Mexico, Cancún 2014 |website=cancun.gob.mx |access-date=September 2, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111234057/http://cancun.gob.mx/visitantes/historia-de-la-ciudad/ |archive-date=November 11, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> In older English-language documents, the city's name is sometimes spelled ''Cancoon'', an attempt to convey the sound of the name.<ref>{{cite book |title=Transportation, improving mobility for older Americans: hearings before the Subcommittee on Federal, State, and Community Services of the Select Committee on Aging, House of Representatives, Ninety-fourth Congress, second session |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JRxDAQAAMAAJ&q=%22cancoon%22+mexico |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |access-date=9 November 2014 |year=1976 }}</ref>

''Cancún'' is derived from the Mayan name {{lang|yua|kàan kun}}, composed of {{lang|yua|kàan}} 'snake' and the verb {{lang|yua|kum}} ~ {{lang|yua|kun}} 'to swell, overfill'.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Bricker |first1=Victoria Reifler |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HN0uAAAAYAAJ |title=A Dictionary of the Maya Language: As Spoken in Hocabá, Yucatán |last2=Yah |first2=Eleuterio Poʻot |last3=Poʻot |first3=Ofelia Dzul de |date=1998 |publisher=University of Utah Press |isbn=978-0-87480-569-7 |pages=122, 137 |language=en }}</ref> Two translations have been suggested: the first is 'nest of snakes' and the second, less accepted one is 'place of the golden snake'.<ref name="CancunName">{{cite web |title=Fast Facts |url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/namerica/caribb/cancun/cancunfacts.htm |access-date=2013-04-18 |website=World Atlas |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224150835/http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/namerica/caribb/cancun/cancunfacts.htm |archive-date=December 24, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Snake iconography was prevalent at the pre-Columbian site of Nizuc.<ref name="Andrews">{{cite web |url=http://research.famsi.org/aztlan/uploads/papers/Andrews-Cancun-Aztlan-06-2.pdf |title=Historic Notes and Observations on Isla Cancún, Quintana Roo |website=famsi.org |last=Andrews |first=Anthony P. |access-date=May 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730234906/http://research.famsi.org/aztlan/uploads/papers/Andrews-Cancun-Aztlan-06-2.pdf |archive-date=July 30, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the years after the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]], much of the Maya population died or left as a result of [[Native American disease and epidemics#European contact|disease]], warfare, and [[famine]]s, leaving only small settlements on [[Isla Mujeres]] and [[Cozumel Island]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cancunairporttransportations.com/blog/disappearance-of-mayans-inhabiting-cancun/ |title=Disappearance of Mayans inhabiting Cancun |work=Cancun Airport Transportations |date=April 22, 2021}}</ref>

Cancún is a [[planned city]], created to foster tourism. When development of the area as a resort was started on January 23, 1970, Isla Cancún had only three residents, all caretakers of the coconut plantation of Don José de Jesús Lima Gutiérrez, who lived on [[Isla Mujeres]]. Some 117 people lived in nearby Puerto Juárez, a fishing village and military base.<ref name="siegel">{{Cite book

In 1967 government allocated 2 million dollars fund to be administered by the [[Bank of Mexico]] to determine the feasibility of creating new recreational zones, “preferably where no other viable development alternatives exist." This was entrusted to INFRATUR, a Bank of Mexico agency.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Dunphy |first=Robert |date=5 March 1972 |title=Why the Computer Chose Cancun |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/05/archives/why-the-computer-chose-cancun-how-the-computer-chose-cancun-as.html |work=[[New York Times]]}}</ref>

Due to the reluctance of investors to gamble on an unknown area, the Mexican federal government financed the first nine hotels.<ref name="siegel"/>

The city began as a tourism project in 1974 as an Integrally Planned Center, a pioneer of FONATUR (''Fondo Nacional de Fomento al Turismo'', National Fund for Tourism Development), formerly known as INFRATUR. Since then, it has undergone a comprehensive transformation from being a fisherman's island to being one of the two most well-known Mexican resorts, along with [[Acapulco]].

Most 'Cancunenses' are from Yucatán and other Mexican states. A growing number are from the rest of the [[Americas]] and [[Europe]]. The municipal authorities have struggled to provide public services for the constant influx of people, as well as limiting squatters and irregular developments, which now{{when|date=September 2021}} occupy an estimated ten to fifteen percent of the mainland area on the fringes of the city.<ref name="siegel"/>

In 2023, a record 21 million tourists visited Cancún, topping the original estimate of 20.5 million.<ref name="sipse.com">{{cite web|url=https://sipse.com/novedades/preven-cierre-de-ano-con-21-millones-de-turistas-en-q-roo-460400.html|title=Prevén cierre de año con 21 millones de turistas en Q.

In the 21st century, Cancún had largely avoided the [[Mexican Drug War|violence]] associated with the trade of illegal drugs; however, drugs are sold to tourists in bars and night clubs. Cancún has gradually been reported for being a center of [[money laundering]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Booth |first=William |date=May 27, 2010 |title=Mayor of Cancun, Mexico, charged with drug trafficking, money laundering |newspaper=Washington Post |agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/26/AR2010052604854.html?hpid=sec-world|url-status=live|access-date=August 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926095744/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/26/AR2010052604854.html?hpid=sec-world |archive-date=September 26, 2017}}</ref>
The links with Cancún date from the 1990s and early 2000s, when the area was controlled by the [[Juárez Cartel|Juárez]] and Gulf drug cartels. By 2010, [[Los Zetas]], a group that broke away from the [[Gulf Cartel]], had taken control of many smuggling routes through the Yucatán, according to the U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hawley |first=Chris |date=May 26, 2010 |title=Drugs cast cloud over Mexican paradise |newspaper=USA Today |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2010-05-26-cancun-mayor_N.htm |url-status=live |access-date=2010-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530070344/http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2010-05-26-cancun-mayor_N.htm |archive-date=May 30, 2010}}</ref>

===Climate===
[[File:How Cancún Grew into a Major Resort.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.35|Satellite picture of Cancún]]
Cancún has a [[tropical climate]], specifically a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''[[Tropical savannah climate|Aw]]''), with little temperature difference between months, but pronounced rainy and dry seasons. The city is hot year-round, and moderated by onshore trade winds, with an annual mean temperature of {{convert|27.1|C|1}}. Unlike inland areas of the Yucatán Peninsula, sea breezes restrict high temperatures from reaching {{convert|36|C}} on most afternoons. Annual rainfall is around {{convert|1340|mm|1|sp=us}}, falling on 115 days per year.

The rainy season runs from late August through November, and the dry season runs from November through April.

====Tropical storms and hurricanes====
[[File:Playacancun1.JPG|thumb|Cancún beaches, km 12]]
The tropical storm season lasts from May to December, the rainy season extends into January with peak precipitation in October. February to early May tend to be drier with only occasional scattered showers. Cancún is located in one of the main Caribbean hurricane impact areas. Although large hurricanes are rare, they have struck near Cancún in recent years, [[Hurricane Wilma]] in 2005 being the largest. [[Hurricane Gilbert]] made a devastating direct hit on Cancún in September 1988 and the tourist hotels needed to be rebuilt. In both cases, federal, state and municipal authorities were well prepared to deal with most of the effects on tourists and local residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hurricanecancun.com/2007/08/16/hurricane-dean-on-course-for-cancun/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712231856/http://hurricanecancun.com/2007/08/16/hurricane-dean-on-course-for-cancun/ |archive-date=July 12, 2011|title=Hurricane Dean On Course for Cancún|date=August 16, 2007}}</ref> [[Hurricane Dean]] in 2007 also made its mark on the city of Cancún.

Making landfall in 1988, Hurricane Gilbert was the second most intense hurricane ever observed in the Atlantic basin. It landed on the Yucatán peninsula after crossing over the island of Cozumel. In the Cancún region, a loss of $87&nbsp;million (1989 [[United States dollar|USD]]) due to a decline in tourism was estimated for the months of October, November and December in 1988.<ref name="Cancún">{{cite web|author=Benigono Aguirre |title=Cancun under Gilbert: Preliminary Observations |publisher=International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters March 1989, Vol. 7, No.1, pp. 69–82 |access-date=October 1, 2006 |url=http://www.udel.edu/DRC/Aguirre/publications/ag35.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210104904/http://www.udel.edu/DRC/Aguirre/publications/ag35.pdf |archive-date=December 10, 2005 }}</ref>

On October 21, 2005, Hurricane Wilma made landfall on Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula as a powerful Category 4 hurricane, with strong winds in excess of {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The hurricane's eye first passed over the island of [[Cozumel]], and then made an official landfall near [[Playa del Carmen]] in the state of Quintana Roo at around 11&nbsp;p.m. local time on October 21 with winds near {{convert|140|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Portions of the island of Cozumel experienced the calm eye of Wilma for several hours with some blue skies and sunshine visible at times. The eye slowly drifted northward, with the center passing just to the west of Cancún, Quintana Roo.

Two years later after Hurricane Wilma, in 2007, Hurricane Dean made landfall as a Category 5 storm in [[Majahual]], {{convert|190|mi|km|}} to the south of Cancún. Fierce winds at the edge of Dean's impact cone stripped sand off {{convert|7.5|mi|km|}} of beaches from Punta Cancún (Camino Real Hotel) to Punta Nizuc (Club Med).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://novenet.com.mx/seccion.php?id=63845&sec=3&d=22&m=08&y=2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929035342/http://novenet.com.mx/seccion.php?id=63845&sec=3&d=22&m=08&y=2007|title=Novedades de Quintana Roo|archivedate=September 29, 2007}}</ref>
The authorities asked tourism operators to suspend sending tourists to Cancún while Hurricane Dean was approaching, but did ask airlines to send empty planes, which were then used to evacuate tourists already there.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Huge-hurricane-roils-Yucatan-2509207.php|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709051813/http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-08-21/news/17258108_1_hurricane-dean-mexico-s-gulf-coast-yucatan-peninsula |archive-date=July 9, 2012 |title=Huge hurricane roils Yucatan|author1=James C.

==Attractions==
===Old Airport Control Tower Memorial===
Despite being a young city, Cancún has a memorial monument of its foundation on a replica of the old Airport Control Tower that resembles to its own date of foundation. The original control tower was a provisional wooden structure, the work of Mexican architects Agustín and Enrique Landa Verdugo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mexicanroutes.com/cancun-airports-old-control-tower-memorial/|title=Cancun airport's old control tower memorial|date=February 7, 2021 |publisher="Mexican Routes" [mexicanroutes.com]}}</ref>

The old airport was located on the same part of the city that today corresponds to the Kabah Avenue. The tower is 15 meters tall, has a 45 step staircase and has a base dimension of 5&nbsp;×&nbsp;5 meters. The memorial was first built in 2002 with a donation by Aerocaribe, a local airline, but the structure was damaged after [[Hurricane Wilma]] in 2005. After pleas by the local people to rebuild the tower memorial, a new version was erected in 2010, which was later abandoned without proper maintenance until Woox Pinturas, a local wood maintenance company, made a donation to restore the structure to its original appearance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.revistapioneros.com/la-antigua-torre-de-control-simbolo-de-la-fundacion-de-cancun/|title=La antigua torre de control, símbolo de la fundación de Cancún |date=April 8, 2013 |lang=es |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527195806/http://www.revistapioneros.com/la-antigua-torre-de-control-simbolo-de-la-fundacion-de-cancun/ |archive-date=May 27, 2015}}</ref>

===El Ceviche Fountain===
The real name of this monument is "Caribbean Fantasy", located in the heart of downtown Cancún, between the [[Coba]] and [[Tulum]] avenues [[Intersection (road)|intersection]]. It is the nerve center of the daily urban traffic of the city. It has witnessed multiple social and political events, undergoing constant repairs and remodeling for years.

Six years after Quintana Roo was recognized as the youngest state in the [[Mexican Republic]] and barely a decade after the city of Cancún was born, on October 22 and 23, 1981, the [[North–South Summit|North-South Summit]] was held at the now defunct [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton Hotel]]. Two abstract pillars made of metal crossbeams gave the structure a stepped [[Pyramid|pyramidal]] appearance, with small masts displaying the [[Flag|flags]] of the countries attending the 1981 North-South Summit. The author, [[:es:Lorraine Pinto|Lorraine Pinto]], added details representing [[Quetzalcoatl]] on the sides, resembling the [[Chichen Itza|pyramid of Chichen-Itza]], located in [[Yucatán|Yucatan]].

In 1994, the municipal authorities of Cancún decided to demolish the commemorative structure because the city had been the scene of one of the most devastating climatic-environmental phenomena in the history of the Yucatan Peninsula, [[Hurricane Gilbert|Hurricane Gilberto]]. The sculpture was irreversibly affected, leaving only the solid concrete base and the metal skeleton.

Due to its crosswise and bare appearance, the locals began to call it "Insectronic", a device manufactured by the Steren company to kill [[Fly|flies]] and [[Mosquito|mosquitoes]]. The municipal authorities decided to keep its base and the dynamics of the [[Fountain|water fountain]].

Once again, Lorraine Pinto was on call to create what locals began to call the Ceviche Fountain or the Ceviche Roundabout.

===Maya archeological sites===
[[File:Yamiluum1.JPG|thumb|''Yamil Lu'um'', Temple of the Scorpion]]

There are some small Mayan vestiges of the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]] in Cancún.<ref name="tusbuenasnoticias3">{{Cite news|url=https://www.tusbuenasnoticias.com/arte-y-cultura/general/horarios-y-ubicacion-del-museo-maya-de-cancun/33874 |title = Te damos horarios y ubicación del Museo Maya de Cancún para que vayas y veas su nueva exposición Máscaras|newspaper = Tus Buenas Noticias|date = 21 June 2024}}</ref> [[El Rey archaeological site|El Rey]] (Las Ruinas del Rey) is located in the Hotel Zone. El Meco, a more substantial site, is found on the mainland just outside the city limits on the road north to Punta Sam. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

[[Chichén Itzá]] is in the neighboring state of [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]].

==Sports==
Football club [[Atlante F.C.]] was founded in 1916 in [[Mexico City]] and moved to Cancún in 2007 due to poor attendance in Mexico City.<ref name="atlante">{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantefc.com.mx/|title=:: Atlante Futbol Club ::|access-date=15 April 2011|archive-date=April 11, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411163537/http://www.atlantefc.com.mx/|url-status=dead}}</ref> In June 2020, speculation began about a possible move of Atlante F.C. back Mexico City.

The city is also home to the [[Pioneros de Cancún]] of the [[Liga Premier de México]], the third tier of Mexican football.

The [[Tiburones de Cancún]] (Cancún Sharks) were a professional [[American football]] team who played in the [[Fútbol Americano de México]] (FAM) league until the league's dissolution in 2022.

The city is also home to the baseball team [[Tigres de Quintana Roo]], who play in the [[Mexican League]] (LMB).

In October 2023, the [[WTA Finals]] ([[Women's Tennis Association]]) were held in Cancún, in a temporary, outdoor, [[hard court]] stadium in Plaza [[Quintana Roo]] with a capacity of 4,300. [[Aryna Sabalenka]] and [[Elena Rybakina]] criticized the facility, saying that it was unacceptable for high level [[tennis]], not ready in time for practice, and there was no time to fix it.<ref name="2023-10-31_ABC">[https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-31/aryna-sabalenka-labels-wta-finals-court-disrespectful/103042304 Aryna Sabalenka labels WTA Finals court in Cancún unacceptable for high-level tennis], [[Associated Press]]/[[ABC News Online]], 2023-10-31</ref>
