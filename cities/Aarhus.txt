It is located on the eastern shore of [[Jutland]] in the [[Kattegat]] sea and approximately {{convert|187|km}} northwest of [[Copenhagen]].

Dating back to the late 8th century, Aarhus was founded as a harbour settlement at the mouth of the [[Aarhus River]] and quickly became a trade hub. The first Christian church was built here around the year 900 and later in the Viking Age the town was fortified with defensive ramparts. The [[Ancient See of Aarhus|bishopric of Aarhus]] grew steadily stronger and more prosperous, building several religious institutions in the town during the early [[Middle Ages]]. Trade continued to improve, although it was not until 1441 that Aarhus was granted [[market town]] privileges, and the population of Aarhus remained relatively stable until the 19th century. The city began to grow significantly as trade prospered in the mid-18th century, but not until the mid-19th century did the [[Industrial Revolution]] bring real growth in population. The first railway line in Jutland was built here in 1862. In 1928, the first university in Jutland was founded in Aarhus and today it is a university city and the largest centre for trade, services, industry, and tourism in Jutland.

[[Aarhus Cathedral]] is the longest cathedral in Denmark with a total length of {{convert|93|m|abbr=on}}. The [[Church of Our Lady (Aarhus)|Church of our Lady]] (''Vor Frue Kirke'') was originally built in 1060, making it the oldest stone church in Scandinavia. The [[Aarhus City Hall|City Hall]], designed by [[Arne Jacobsen]] and [[Erik Møller]], was completed in 1941 in a modern [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalist]] style. [[Aarhus Theatre]], the largest provincial theatre in Denmark, opposite the cathedral on Bispetorvet, was built by Hack Kampmann in the Art Nouveau style and completed in 1916. [[Musikhuset Aarhus]] (concert hall) and [[Det Jyske Musikkonservatorium]] (Royal Academy of Music, Aarhus/Aalborg) are also of note, as are its museums including the [[open-air museum]] [[Den Gamle By]], the art museum [[ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum]], the [[Moesgård Museum]] and the women's museum [[Kvindemuseet]]. The city's major cultural institutions include Den Gamle By, ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum, the Moesgård Museum, [[Kvindemuseet|Gender Museum Denmark]], Musikhuset Aarhus and [[Aarhus Theatre]]. Known as ''{{lang|da|Smilets By}}'' (lit. City of Smiles) it is the Danish city with the youngest demographics and home to [[Scandinavia]]'s largest university, [[Aarhus University]].<ref name="DSPopulation"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistikbanken.dk/02|title=Statistikbanken|website=www.statistikbanken.dk}}</ref> Commercially, the city is the principal [[container port]] in the country, and major Danish companies such as [[Vestas]], [[Arla Foods]], [[Salling Group]], and [[Jysk]] have their headquarters there.

Some Danish cities resisted the change but Aarhus city council opted to change the name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aarhusportalen.dk/default.asp?Id=1881&AjrDcmntId=30979 |title=Det omstridte bolle-å |publisher=Aarhus portalen |access-date=16 July 2014 |language=da |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808213323/http://www.aarhusportalen.dk/default.asp?Id=1881&AjrDcmntId=30979 |archive-date=8 August 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2010, the city council voted to change the name back from {{lang|da|Århus}} to {{lang|da|Aarhus}} again with effect from 1 January 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dsn.dk/nyheder-og-arrangementer/aarhus-eller-aarhus/|title=Århus eller Aarhus?|website=dsn.dk|access-date=23 January 2023|language=da}}</ref>

It is still grammatically correct to write geographical names with the letter Å and local councils are allowed to use the Aa spelling as an alternative and most newspapers and public institutions will accept either. Some official authorities such as the [[Dansk Sprognævn|Danish Language Committee]], publisher of the [[Retskrivningsordbogen|Danish Orthographic Dictionary]], still retain {{lang|da|Århus}} as the main name, providing {{lang|da|Aarhus}} as a second option, in brackets<ref name=spelling>{{cite web |url=http://dsn.dk/nyt/nyheder/2011/aarhus-eller-aarhus |title=Århus eller Aarhus? |year=2011 |publisher=Danish Language Committee |language=da}}</ref> and some institutions are still using {{lang|da|Århus}} explicitly in their official name, such as the local newspaper {{lang|da|[[Århus Stiftstidende]]|italic=no}} and the schools {{lang|da|[[Århus Kunstakademi]]|italic=no}} and {{lang|da|[[Århus Statsgymnasium]]|italic=no}}. "Aa" was used by some major institutions between 1948 and 2011 as well, such as [[Aarhus University]] or the largest local sports club, {{lang|da|[[Aarhus Gymnastikforening]]|italic=no}} (AGF), which has never used the "Å" spelling.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/art5488680/Borgmesters-attentat-p%C3%A5-bolle-%C3%A5-g%C3%A5r-verden-rundt |title=Borgmesters attentat på bolle-å går verden rundt |author=Anne-Bech Danielsen |newspaper=Politiken |language=da |date=20 March 2010| access-date=21 October 2017}}</ref> Certain geographically affiliated names have been updated to reflect the name of the city, such as the Aarhus River, changed from {{lang|da|Århus Å}} to {{lang|da|Aarhus Å}}.<ref name="The Aarhus River"/>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Aarhus}}

===Early history===
Founded in the early [[Viking Age]], Aarhus is one of the oldest cities in Denmark, along with [[Ribe]] and [[Hedeby]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/|title=Byhistoriske hovedtræk – Byens grundlæggelse|language=da|publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]]|access-date=15 August 2014|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130914192312/http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/|archive-date=14 September 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The original Aros settlement was situated on the northern shores of a [[Förden and East Jutland Fjorde|fjord]] by the mouth of the [[Aarhus River]], right where the city center is today. It quickly became a hub for sea-going trade due to its position on intersecting trade routes in the [[Danish straits]] and the fertile countryside. The trade, however, was not nearly as prominent as that in Ribe and Hedeby during the Viking Age, and it was primarily linked to Norway as evidenced by archaeological finds. A shipbuilding yard from the Viking Age was uncovered upriver in 2002 by archaeologists. It was located at a place formerly known as ''Snekkeeng'', or Snekke Meadow in English ('Snekke' is a type of [[longship]]), east of the [[Brabrand Lake]] close to [[Viby J|Viby]], and it was in use for more than 400 years from the late 700s till around the mid-1200s.<ref name=UBAS>{{cite journal|url=https://bora.uib.no/bora-xmlui/handle/1956/11335|title=Det ældste Århus – ca. 770–1200|publisher=[[Bergen University]]|author=Hans Skov|language=Danish|journal=UBAS Nordisk|volume=5|year=2008|pages=215–226|access-date=2 April 2021}}</ref>

The fortifications were later improved and expanded by his son [[Harald Bluetooth]], encircling the settlement much like the defence structures found at [[Viking ring fortress]]es elsewhere.<ref name="Kristeligt" /> Together with the town's geographical placement, this suggests that Aros became an important military centre in the Viking Age. There are also strong indications of a former royal residence from the same period in [[Viby J|Viby]], a few kilometres south of the Aarhus city centre.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tilbage til vikingetiden |trans-title=Back to the Viking Age |url=https://www.vikingemuseet.dk/om-udstillingen-vikingernes-aros/ |publisher=Vikingemuseet (MOMU) |language=da}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Kaiser |first=Jens |title=Vikingernes Viby |url=https://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/ECE4433725/Vikingernes-Viby/ |publisher=Jyllands-Posten Aarhus |date=12 June 2005 |language=da}}</ref>

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Århus Katedral2.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Aarhus Cathedral. The cathedral was founded in 1190 and the original version stood finished in the year 1300.]]
The growing influence of the Church during the [[Middle Ages]] gradually turned Aarhus, with its bishopric, into a prosperous religious centre. Many public and religious buildings were built in and around the town; notably [[Aarhus Cathedral]] was initiated in the late 12th&nbsp;century by the influential bishop [[Peder Vognsen]], and around 1200, Aros had a total of four churches. The 13th century also marks a thorough reorganisation, erasing most of the town's original layout with new streets, relocations, dismantling and new constructions. The Church clearly had the upper hand in the Aarhus region during medieval times, and the large [[Ancient See of Aarhus|bishopric of Aarhus]] prospered and expanded territory, reaching as far as [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]] in extent.<ref name=UBAS /> In 1441, [[Christopher III]] issued the oldest known charter granting market town status, although similar privileges may have existed as far back as the 12th&nbsp;century. The charter is the first official recognition of the town as a regional power and is by some considered Aarhus's birth certificate.<ref name="Danmarkshistorien" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/%C3%85rhus_k%C3%B8bstads_privilegium |title=Stenbroen |website=AarhusWiki |publisher=Aarhus Stadsarkiv |language=da |access-date=26 July 2015}}</ref>

The commercial and religious status spurred town growth, and in 1477 the defensive earthen ramparts, which had ringed the town since the Viking Age, were abandoned to accommodate expansion. Parts of the ramparts still exist today and can be experienced as steep slopes at the riverside, and they have also survived in some place names of the inner city, including the streets of [[Volden, Aarhus|Volden]] (The Rampart) and [[Graven, Aarhus|Graven]] (The Moat).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/voldgraven.htm |title=The Moat |language=da |publisher=The Viking Museum |access-date=15 August 2014 |archive-date=19 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819090527/http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/vikingemuseet/voldgraven.htm |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Historien_om_Aarhus |title=Historien om Aarhus |language=da |publisher=Aarhus Stadsarkiv |access-date=26 July 2015}}</ref> Aarhus grew to become one of the largest cities in the country by the early 16th&nbsp;century. In 1657, [[octroi]] was imposed in larger Danish cities which changed the layout and face of Aarhus over the following decades. Wooden city walls were erected to prevent smuggling, with gates and toll booths on the major thoroughfares, [[Mejlgade]] and [[Studsgade]]. The city gates funnelled most traffic through a few streets where merchant quarters were built.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/registranter/stenbro/side6.htm |title=Stenbroen |website=Aarhus Kommunes digitale korttjenester |publisher=Aarhus Kommune |language=da |access-date=22 November 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072940/http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/registranter/stenbro/side6.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref>

In the 17th&nbsp;century, Aarhus entered a period of recession as it suffered blockades and bombardments during the [[Dano-Swedish War (1658–60)|Swedish wars]] and trade was dampened by the preferential treatment of the capital by the state.{{sfn|Olsen|2000|p=124}} Not until the middle of the 18th&nbsp;century did growth return, in large part due to trade with the large agricultural [[catchment area]]s around the city; grain, particularly, proved to be a remunerative export.<ref name="Danmarkshistorien"/> The first factories were established at this time, as the [[Industrial Revolution]] reached the country, and in 1810 the harbour was expanded to accommodate growing trade.<ref name=dcfb>{{cite web |url=http://dendigitalebyport.byhistorie.dk/koebstaeder/by.aspx?koebstadID=74 |title=Århus: Byhistorie |publisher=Dansk Center for Byhistorie |access-date=16 July 2014 |language=da}}</ref>

===Industrialisation===
[[File:Aarhus set fra bakkerne i Riis Skov.jpg|right|thumb|View of Aarhus, 1850]]
Aarhus began to prosper in the 1830s as the [[History of Denmark#Industrialisation|industrial revolution]] reached the city and factories with steam-driven machinery became more productive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ddb.byhistorie.dk/koebstaeder/by.aspx?koebstadID=74|title=Danmarks Købstæder: Århus: Byhistorie|publisher=Dansk Center for Byhistorie|access-date=25 January 2023 |language=da}}</ref> In 1838, the electoral laws were reformed leading to elections for the 15 seats on the city council. The rules were initially very strict, allowing only the wealthiest citizens to run. In the 1844 elections, only 174 citizens qualified out of a total population of more than 7,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aarhus.dk/da/politik/Byraadet/Byens-raad-dengang/Byens-raad-1838-1868.aspx|title=Byens raad 1838–1868|language=da|first=Aarhus|last=Kommune|website=Aarhus Kommune|publisher=Aarhus Municipality|access-date=21 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129072144/https://www.aarhus.dk/da/politik/Byraadet/Byens-raad-dengang/Byens-raad-1838-1868.aspx|archive-date=29 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first city council, mainly composed of wealthy merchants and industrialists, quickly looked to improve the harbour, situated along the [[Aarhus River]]. Larger ships and growing freight volumes made a river harbour increasingly impractical. In 1840, the harbour was moved to the coast, north of the river, where it became the largest industrial harbour outside Copenhagen over the following 15 years. From the outset, the new harbour was controlled by the city council, as it is to this day.<ref name="Byhistorie.dk">{{cite web|url=http://blog.byhistorie.dk/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/I-medgang-og-modgang-rapport-over-udviklingen-af-den-moderne-havn-i-Aarhus-fra-o.-1840-2006.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://blog.byhistorie.dk/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/I-medgang-og-modgang-rapport-over-udviklingen-af-den-moderne-havn-i-Aarhus-fra-o.-1840-2006.pdf |archive-date=9 October 2022 |url-status=live|last=Andersen|first=Lasse|title=Rapport over udviklingen af den moderne havn i Aarhus fra o. 1840–2006|website=Dansk Center for Byhistorie|access-date=27 June 2016|language=da}}</ref>

During the [[First Schleswig War]], Aarhus was occupied by German troops from 21 June to 24 July 1849. The city was spared any fighting, but in [[Vejlby]] north of the city a cavalry skirmish known as [[Skirmish of Århus|Rytterfægtningen]] took place which stopped the German advance through Jutland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/AarhusStadsarkiv/Home/Servicesider/Nyheder/2014/3-kvartal/Ugens-Aarhushistorie-Rytterfaegtningen.aspx?sc_lang=da|title=Ugens Aarhushistorie – Rytterfægtningen|website=Aarhus Stadsarkiv|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|language=da|access-date=22 November 2014|archive-date=20 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620103806/http://www.aarhus.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/AarhusStadsarkiv/Home/Servicesider/Nyheder/2014/3-kvartal/Ugens-Aarhushistorie-Rytterfaegtningen.aspx?sc_lang=da|url-status=dead}}</ref> The war and occupation left a notable impact on the city as many streets, particularly on [[Frederiksbjerg]], are named after Danish officers of the time.

In spite of wars and occupation, the city continued to expand and develop. In 1851, the [[octroi]] was abolished and the city walls were removed to provide easier access for trade. Regular [[steamship]] links with Copenhagen had begun with the ''[[Dandy (paddle steamer)|Jylland]]'' in 1825–26 and the ''[[PS Quentin Durward (1823)|Dania]]'' (1827–36), and in 1862 Jutland's first railway was established between Aarhus and [[Randers]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Fælles kræfter.

In the second half of the 19th&nbsp;century, industrialisation came into full effect and a number of new industries emerged around production and refinement of agricultural products, especially oil and butter. Many companies from this time would come to leave permanent iconic marks on Aarhus. The [[Ceres Brewery]] was established in 1856 and served as Aarhus's local brewery for more than 150 years, gradually expanding into an industrial district known as ''Ceres-grunden'' (lit.: the Ceres-ground).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ceres.dk/Default.aspx?ID=25|last=Ceres|title=History|access-date=27 June 2016|language=da|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328140433/http://www.ceres.dk/Default.aspx?ID=25|archive-date=28 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoflev.dk/article.asp?id=134|last=Ceres|title=Ceres Bryggerierne A/S|year=2013|website=Hoflev|access-date=27 June 2016|language=da|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507181622/http://www.hoflev.dk/article.asp?id=134|archive-date=7 May 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhusportalen.dk/ceres-grunden.asp|title=Ceres-grunden|language=da|publisher=Aarhusportalen (Jyllands-Posten)|access-date=11 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814092510/http://www.aarhusportalen.dk/ceres-grunden.asp|archive-date=14 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1896, local farmers and businessmen created [[Korn- og Foderstof Kompagniet]] (KFK), focused on grain and [[Animal feed|feedstuffs]].

Aarhus became the largest provincial city in the country by the turn of the century and the city marketed itself as the "Capital of Jutland". The population increased from 15,000 in 1870 to 52,000 in 1901 and, in response, the city annexed large land areas to develop new residential quarters such as [[Trøjborg]], [[Frederiksbjerg]] and [[Marselisborg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/registranter/frederiksbjerg/side1.htm |title=Frederiksbjerg Øst – Århus |language=da |author=Magistratens 2.

On 9 April 1940, [[Nazi Germany]] invaded Denmark, occupying Aarhus the following day; the occuption lasted for five years. This was a destructive period with major disasters, loss of life and economic depression. The [[Port of Aarhus]] became a hub for supplies to the [[Baltics]] and [[Norway]], while the surrounding rail network supplied the [[Atlantic Wall]] in west Jutland and cargo headed for Germany. Combined, these factors resulted in a strong German presence, especially in 1944–45.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Den_tyske_bes%C3%A6ttelse|title=Aarhus Besættelse|publisher=[[Vester Allé 12#Aarhus City Archives|Aarhus City Archives]]|access-date=8 April 2016}}</ref>

=== The 2000s ===
[[File:Aarhus docklands by night.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Urban development in Aarhus city centre, 2013]]
Since the turn of the millennium, Aarhus has seen an unprecedented building boom with many new institutions, infrastructure projects, city districts and recreational areas. Several of the construction projects are among the largest in Europe, such as the [[Aarhus University Hospital|New University Hospital]] (DNU) and the harbourfront redevelopment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archello.com/project/aarhus-university-hospital---auh|title=Hospital City on a Human Scale - the New University Hospital in Aarhus|publisher=Archello|access-date=25 January 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://trap.lex.dk/Aarhus_Havn|title=Aarhus Havn|date=November 2019 |publisher=lex: TrapDanmark|access-date=25 January 2023 |language=da}}</ref>

Both the skyline and land use of the inner city is changing, as former industrial sites are being redeveloped into new city districts and neighbourhoods. Starting in 2008, the former docklands known as ''De Bynære Havnearealer'' (The Peri-urban Harbour-areas), and closest to the city seaside, are being converted to new mixed-use districts. It is among the largest harbourfront projects in Europe. The northern part dubbed ''Aarhus Ø'' ([[Aarhus Docklands]]) is almost finished as of 2018, while the southern district dubbed ''Sydhavnskvarteret'' (The South-harbour neighbourhood) is only starting to be developed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aarhus.dk/da/politik/Politikker-og-planer/Byudvikling-og-planlaegning/De-Bynaere-Havnearealer.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422202630/https://www.aarhus.dk/da/politik/Politikker-og-planer/Byudvikling-og-planlaegning/De-Bynaere-Havnearealer.aspx|url-status=dead|title=De Bynære Havnearealer|archive-date=22 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessaarhus.dk/da/Fremtidens-Aarhus/Udviklingsomraader/Aarhus-Oe.aspx|title=Business Aarhus, Aarhus Ø|publisher=Business Aarhus|access-date=20 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129062245/http://www.businessaarhus.dk/da/Fremtidens-Aarhus/Udviklingsomraader/Aarhus-Oe.aspx|archive-date=29 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.aarhus.dk/da/erhverv/byggeri-og-grunde/Byudvikling/Sydhavnskvarteret.aspx Sydhavnskvarteret] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423033243/http://www.aarhus.dk/da/erhverv/byggeri-og-grunde/Byudvikling/Sydhavnskvarteret.aspx |date=23 April 2018}} {{in lang|da}}</ref> The adjacent site of Frederiks Plads at the former [[DSB (railway company)|DSB]] repair facilities have been under construction since 2014 as a new business and residential quarter.<ref>Official homepage: [http://frederiksplads.dk/ Frederiks Plads] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502171159/http://frederiksplads.dk/ |date=2 May 2018}} {{in lang|da}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frederiksplads.dk/projekter/id%C3%A9en.aspx|title=Frederiks Plads|publisher=NCC Property Development A/S|access-date=20 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129040101/http://www.frederiksplads.dk/projekter/id%C3%A9en.aspx|archive-date=29 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfmoller.com/g/Frederiks-Plads-ny-bydel-i-centrum-af-Aarhus-i13235.html|title=Frederiks Plads|publisher=C.

==Geography==
[[File:Aerial view of Aarhus 2015.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the bay and city]]
Aarhus is located at the [[Bay of Aarhus]] facing the [[Kattegat]] sea in the east with the peninsulas of [[Mols]] and [[Helgenæs]] across the bay to the northeast. Mols and Helgenæs are both part of the larger regional peninsula of [[Djursland]]. A number of larger cities and towns is within easy reach from Aarhus by road and rail, including [[Randers]] ({{convert|38.5|km}} by road north), [[Grenå]] (northeast), [[Horsens]] ({{convert|50|km}} south) and [[Silkeborg]] ({{convert|44|km}} east).<ref name="GM">{{Google maps|url=http://www.freemaptools.com/how-far-is-it-between.htm|access-date=18 December 2014}}</ref>

===Topography===
At Aarhus's location, the Bay of Aarhus provides a natural harbour with a depth of {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} quite close to the shore.{{sfn|Olsen|2000|p=124}} Aarhus was founded at the mouth of a brackish water [[Förden and East Jutland Fjorde|fjord]], but the original fjord no longer exists, as it has gradually narrowed into what is now the [[Aarhus River]] and the [[Brabrand Lake]], due to natural [[Sediment transport#Fluvial|sedimentation]]. The land around Aarhus was once covered by forests, remains of which exist in parts of [[Marselisborg Forest]] to the south and [[Riis Skov]] to the north.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Jylland/Riis_Skov|title=Riis Skov|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|access-date=28 July 2014 |language=da}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dengamleby.dk/museum-aarhus/malerier-fra-aarhus/marselisborgskovene/ |title=Marselisborgskovene |publisher=Den Gamle By |access-date=27 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306053230/http://www.dengamleby.dk/museum-aarhus/malerier-fra-aarhus/marselisborgskovene/ |archive-date=6 March 2014}}</ref> Several lakes extend west from the inner city as the landscape merges with the larger region of [[Søhøjlandet]] with heights exceeding {{convert|152|m|ft}} at [[Himmelbjerget]] between [[Skanderborg]] and [[Silkeborg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhus.dk/~/media/Dokumenter/Teknik-og-Miljoe/Natur-og-Miljoe/Ud-i-naturen/Stier-og-ruter/6-infotavler-Vandreruten-Aarhus-Silkeborg.ashx|title=Vandreruten Aarhus-Silkeborg|publisher=Aarhus.dk|access-date=1 August 2014|language=da|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809204445/http://www.aarhus.dk/~/media/Dokumenter/Teknik-og-Miljoe/Natur-og-Miljoe/Ud-i-naturen/Stier-og-ruter/6-infotavler-Vandreruten-Aarhus-Silkeborg.ashx|archive-date=9 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The highest natural point in Aarhus Municipality is Jelshøj at 128 metres above sea level, in the southern district of [[Højbjerg]].

The hilly area around Aarhus consists of a [[moraine|morainal plateau]] from the last ice age, broken by a complex system of [[tunnel valley]]s. The most prominent valleys of this network are the Aarhus Valley in the south, stretching inland east–west with the Aarhus River, Brabrand Lake, Årslev Lake and Tåstrup Lake, and the [[Egå|Egå Valley]] to the north, with the stream of [[Egå]]en, [[Egå Engsø]], the bog of [[Geding-Kasted Mose]] and [[Geding Lake]]. Most parts of the two valleys have been drained and subsequently farmed, but in the early 2000s some of the drainage was removed and parts of the wetlands were restored for environmental reasons. The valley system also includes the stream of Lyngbygård Å in the west and valleys to the south of the city, following erosion channels from the [[quaternary|pre-quaternary]]. By contrast, the Aarhus River Valley and the Giber River Valley are late [[glacial meltwater valley]]s. The coastal cliffs along the Bay of Aarhus consist of shallow [[tertiary]] clay from the [[Eocene]] and [[Oligocene]] (57 to 24 million years ago).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Danmarks_kommuner/%C3%85rhus_Kommune|title=Aarhus Kommune|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|access-date=19 July 2014 |language=da}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://extra.geus.info/web/nm-grundvand-brabrand-dalen.htm|title=Brabrand Dalen|date=13 January 2005|publisher=[[Aarhus County]]|access-date=9 April 2016|language=da}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ntsnet.dk/sites/default/files/%C3%85rhus%20%C3%85dal.pdf|title=Aarhus Ådal|publisher=[[Danish Ministry of Education]]|access-date=9 April 2016|language=da|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000141/http://ntsnet.dk/sites/default/files/%C3%85rhus%20%C3%85dal.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/|title=Landskab og bebyggelse|publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]]|access-date=9 April 2016|language=da|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130914192312/http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/|archive-date=14 September 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The city centre experiences the same climatic effects as other larger cities with higher wind speeds, more fog, less precipitation and higher temperatures than the surrounding, open land.<ref name="WeatherOnline">{{cite web |url=http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/climate/Denmark.htm |title=Denmark |publisher=WeatherOnline |access-date=24 November 2014 |language=da}}</ref>

Western winds from the Atlantic and [[North Sea]] are dominant resulting in more precipitation in western Denmark. In addition, Jutland rises sufficiently in the centre to lift air to higher, colder altitudes contributing to increased precipitation in eastern Jutland. Combined, these factors make east and south Jutland comparatively wetter than other parts of the country.<ref name="DMI-climate"/> Average temperature over the year is {{convert|8.43|°C}} with February being the coldest month ({{convert|0.1|C|F|disp=or}}) and August the warmest ({{convert|15.9|C|F|disp=or}}). Temperatures in the sea can reach {{convert|17|-|22|C|F}} in June to August, but it is not uncommon for beaches to register {{convert|25|C|F}} locally.<ref name="WeatherOnline"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ditdanmark.com/article.95.html |title=The climate in Denmark |publisher=DitDanmark |access-date=9 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305212556/http://www.ditdanmark.com/article.95.html |archive-date=5 March 2016}}</ref>

The geography in the area affects the local climate of the city with the Aarhus Bay imposing a temperate effect on the low-lying valley floor where central Aarhus is located. [[Brabrand Lake]] to the west further contributes to this effect and as a result, the valley has a comparably mild, temperate climate. The sandy ground on the valley floor dries up quickly after winter and warms faster in the summer than the surrounding hills of moist-retaining [[boulder clay]]. These conditions affect crops and plants that often bloom 1–2 weeks earlier in the valley than on the northern and southern hillsides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/index.php?title=Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Danmarks_kommuner/%C3%85rhus_Kommune|title=Aarhus Kommune|publisher=[[Gyldendal]]|access-date=23 November 2014|language=da}}</ref>

Because of the northern latitude, the number of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 2 minutes of daylight. The difference in length of days and nights between summer and winter solstices is 10 hours and 30 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torbenhermansen.dk/almanak/almanak.php#|title=Sol op/ned |publisher=Almanak|access-date=17 November 2013|language=da}}</ref>

<!--- Water --->
The municipality aims for a coherent and holistic administration of the [[water cycle]] to protect against, and clean up previous, pollution as well as encourage [[green growth]] and self-sufficiency. The main issues are [[nutrient pollution|excessive nutrients]], adapting to increased (and increasing) levels of precipitation brought on by [[climate change]], and securing the water supply.<ref name="VandVision">{{cite web |url=https://aarhus.dk/demokrati/politikker-og-planer/natur-og-miljoe/vandvision2100/ |title=Vand Vision 2100 |publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]] |language=da |access-date=14 April 2019}}</ref> These goals have manifested in a number of large water treatment projects often in collaboration with private partners. In the 2000s, underground rainwater basins were built across the city while the two lakes [[Brabrand Lake|Årslev Engsø]] and [[Egå Engsø]] were created in 2003 and 2006 respectively. The number of [[sewage treatment]] plants is planned to be reduced from 17 to 2 by 2025, as the treatment plants in Marselisborg and Egå are scheduled for expansion to take over all waste water treatment. They have already been refitted for [[biogas]] production to become net producers of electricity and heat.<ref name="Marspower">{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2114761-worlds-first-city-to-power-its-water-needs-with-sewage-energy/|title=World's first city to power its water needs with sewage energy|work=[[New Scientist]]|language=da|first=Kata |last=Karáth |date=1 September 2016 |access-date=14 April 2019}}</ref><ref name="Egåpower">{{cite web |url=http://www.aarhusportalen.dk/nyheder-om-miljoe-og-energi.asp?AjrDcmntId=42435 |title=Epokegørende teknologi får strømmen til at flyde |publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]] |language=da |access-date=22 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419090759/http://www.aarhusportalen.dk/nyheder-om-miljoe-og-energi.asp?AjrDcmntId=42435 |archive-date=19 April 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> To aid the new treatment plants, and avoid floodings, sewage and [[stormwater]] throughout the municipality is planned to be separated into two different drainage systems.

<!--- Afforestation and rewilding --->
[[Afforestation]] projects have been undertaken to prevent [[groundwater pollution]], secure drinking water, [[carbon sequestration|sequester {{chem|CO|2}}]], increase [[biodiversity]], create an attractive countryside, provide easy access to nature and offer outdoor activities to the public. In 2000, the first project, the [[New Forests of Aarhus]], was completed, which aimed to double the forest cover in the municipality and, in 2009, another phase was announced to double forest cover once more before the year 2030.<ref name="Skov2020">{{cite web |url=https://aarhus.dk/media/5158/skovudviklingsplan-2010-2020.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://aarhus.dk/media/5158/skovudviklingsplan-2010-2020.pdf |archive-date=9 October 2022 |url-status=live|title=Skovudviklingsplan 2010 -2020 |publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]] |language=da |access-date=14 April 2019}}</ref> The afforestation plans were realised as a local project in collaboration with private landowners, under a larger national agenda.<ref name="NyeSkove">{{cite web |url=http://www.aarhus.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/gogreenwithaarhus/Home/Maal/Attraktiv-by/Nye-skove-sikrer-drikkevand-natur-og-friluftsliv.aspx?sc_lang=da |title=Nye skove sikrer drikkevand, natur og friluftsliv |publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]] |language=da |access-date=22 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207153418/http://www.aarhus.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/gogreenwithaarhus/Home/Maal/Attraktiv-by/Nye-skove-sikrer-drikkevand-natur-og-friluftsliv.aspx?sc_lang=da |archive-date=7 February 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> Other projects to expand natural habitats include a [[rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] effort in [[Geding-Kasted Mose|Geding-Kasted Bog]] and continuous monitoring of [[List of protected areas of Aarhus Municipality|the four Natura 2000]] areas in the municipality.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aarhus.dk/~/media/Dokumenter/Teknik-og-Miljoe/Natur-og-Miljoe/Natur-og-landskab/Naturkvalitetsplan/Naturkvalitetsplan-2013-2030.pdf|title=Naturkvalitetsplan 2013 - 2030|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|access-date=25 January 2023|language=da|archive-date=16 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116174519/https://www.aarhus.dk/~/media/Dokumenter/Teknik-og-Miljoe/Natur-og-Miljoe/Natur-og-landskab/Naturkvalitetsplan/Naturkvalitetsplan-2013-2030.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The city is home to 75 different religious groups and denominations, most of which are Christian or Muslim with a smaller number of Buddhist, Hindu, and Jewish communities.

During the 1990s there was significant immigration from Turkey and in the 2000s, there was a fast growth in the overall immigrant community, from 27,783 people in 1999 to 40,431 in 2008.{{sfn|Eade|Mele|2011|p=67}} The majority of immigrants have roots outside Europe and the developed world, comprising some 25,000 people from 130 different nationalities, with the largest groups coming from the Middle East and North Africa. Some 15,000 have come from within Europe, with Poland, Germany, Romania and Norway being the largest contributors.<ref name="Danmarks Statistik: FOLK1"/>

Many immigrants have established themselves in the suburbs of [[Brabrand]], [[Hasle, Aarhus|Hasle]] and [[Viby J|Viby]], where the percentage of inhabitants with foreign origins has risen by 66% since 2000. This has resulted in a few so-called [[ghettos]], defined as residential areas with more than half of inhabitants from [[Western world|non-Western countries]] and with relatively high levels of poverty and/or crime. [[Gellerup]] is the most notable neighbourhood in that respect. The ghetto-labelling has been criticized as unnecessarily stigmatising and counterproductive for social and economical development of the related areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.trm.dk/nyheder/2019/faerre-udsatte-boligomraader-og-ghettoomraader-paa-de-nye-lister/|title=Færre udsatte boligområder og ghettoområder på de nye lister |trans-title=Fewer vulnerable neighbourhoods and ghetto-areas on the new lists |publisher=Ministry of Transport and Housing|language=da|date=1 December 2019|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Bestseller cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Headquarters of [[Bestseller (company)|Bestseller]]]]
The economy of Aarhus is predominantly knowledge- and service-based, strongly influenced by the [[University of Aarhus]] and the large healthcare industry. The service sector dominates the economy and is growing as the city transitions away from manufacturing.

===Port of Aarhus===
{{Main|Port of Aarhus}}
[[File:Aarhus Container port.jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|Aarhus Container port]]

The Port of Aarhus is one of the largest industrial ports in northern Europe with the largest container terminal in Denmark, processing more than 50% of Denmark's container traffic and accommodating the largest container vessels in the world.<ref name=aarhushavn>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhushavn.dk/en/about_port_of_aarhus/about_port_of_aarhus.htm|title=About Port of Aarhus|publisher=Aarhus Havn|access-date=16 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724233317/http://www.aarhushavn.dk/en/about_port_of_aarhus/about_port_of_aarhus.htm|archive-date=24 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Signe Ferslev Pedersen">{{cite web|url=http://www.business.dk/transport/maersk-arving-vil-kapre-mere-gods-til-aarhus|title=Mærsk-arving vil kapre mere gods til Aarhus|author=Signe Ferslev Pedersen|work=Berlingske Tidende|date=21 July 2014|access-date=23 July 2014|language=da|archive-date=24 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724143626/http://www.business.dk/transport/maersk-arving-vil-kapre-mere-gods-til-aarhus|url-status=dead}}</ref> It is a municipal self-governing port with independent finances. The facilities handle some 9.5&nbsp;million tonnes of cargo a year (2012). Grain is the principal export, while [[animal feed|feedstuff]]s, stone, cement and coal are among the chief imports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhushavn.dk/en/about_port_of_aarhus/cargo_statistics/cargo_statistics.htm|title=Cargo statistics|publisher=Aarhus Havn|access-date=21 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623123858/http://www.aarhushavn.dk/en/about_port_of_aarhus/cargo_statistics/cargo_statistics.htm|archive-date=23 June 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Since 2012 the port has faced increasing competition from the [[Port of Hamburg]] and freight volumes have decreased somewhat from the peak in 2008.<ref name="Signe Ferslev Pedersen"/>

The ferry terminal presents the only alternative to the [[Great Belt Link]] for passenger transport between Jutland and [[Zealand]]. It has served different ferry companies since the first steamship route to Copenhagen opened in 1830. Currently, [[Mols-Linien]] operates the route and annually transports some two million passengers and a million vehicles. Additional [[roll-on/roll-off]] cargo ferries serve [[Finland]] and [[Kalundborg]] on a weekly basis and smaller outlying Danish ports at irregular intervals. Since the early 2000s the port has increasingly become a destination for cruise lines operating in the [[Baltic Sea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarhushavn.dk/download/formularer/aarsrapport2013.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.aarhushavn.dk/download/formularer/aarsrapport2013.pdf |archive-date=9 October 2022 |url-status=live|publisher=Aarhus Havn|title=Aarsrapport 2013|access-date=9 December 2014 |language=da}}</ref>

In the 2010s, there was a significant expansion of tourist facilities, culminating in the opening of the 240-room Comwell Hotel in July 2014, which increased the number of hotel rooms in the city by 25%. Some estimates put the number of visitors spending at least one night as high as 750,000 a year, most of them Danes from other regions, with the remainder coming mainly from Norway, Sweden, northern Germany and the United Kingdom. Overall, they spend roughly DKK 3&nbsp;billion (€402&nbsp;million) in the city each year.<ref name="kulturturisme.dk">{{cite web|url=http://www.kulturturisme.dk/media/507561/Aarhus-som-kulturel-city-break-destination-final_med_logo.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.kulturturisme.dk/media/507561/Aarhus-som-kulturel-city-break-destination-final_med_logo.pdf |archive-date=9 October 2022 |url-status=live|title=Aarhus som kulturel city destination|publisher=kulturturisme.dk|access-date=23 November 2014}}</ref> The primary motivation for tourists choosing Aarhus as a destination is experiencing the city and culture, family and couples vacation or as a part of a round trip in Denmark.

There are more than 30 tourist information spots across the city. Some of them are staffed, while others are online, publicly accessible touchscreens.

===Research parks===
[[File:Navitas4.jpg|thumb|[[Navitas Park]], a department of INCUBA Science Park]]
The largest research park in Aarhus is [[INCUBA Science Park]], focused on [[IT]] and [[biomedical research]], It is based on Denmark's first research park, ''Forskerpark Aarhus'' (Research Park Aarhus), founded in 1986, which in 2007 merged with another research park to form INCUBA Science Park.

In addition, Aarhus is home to the [[Aarhus School of Architecture]], one of two Danish [[Ministry of Science, Innovation and Higher Education (Denmark)|Ministry of Education]] institutions that provide degree programs in architecture, and some of the largest architecture firms in the [[Nordic countries]] such as [[Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects]], [[Arkitema Architects]] and [[C.

In the interim, the city council supports a culture, business and education centre in the area, which may continue in the future neighbourhood in some form. The future occupants of the neighbourhood will be businesses and organisations selected for their ability to be involved in the local community, and it is hoped that the area will evolve into a hotspot for creativity and design.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arkitektforeningen.dk/node/21310 |publisher=[[Danish Association of Architects]] |title=AAØ Anbefaler Arkitektklyngen i Aarhus |access-date=1 October 2016 |language=da |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017044233/https://arkitektforeningen.dk/node/21310 |archive-date=17 October 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://arkitektforeningen.dk/node/25524 |publisher=[[Danish Association of Architects]] |title=Arkitekterhvervets visioner for en ny arkitektskole i Aarhus |access-date=1 October 2016 |language=da |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017044427/https://arkitektforeningen.dk/node/25524 |archive-date=17 October 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://stiften.dk/aarhus/gode-muligheder-for-at-bevare-jyllands-svar-paa-christiania|newspaper=[[Århus Stiftstidende]]|title=Gode muligheder for at bevare Jyllands svar på Christiania|access-date=1 October 2016|language=da|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009225448/http://stiften.dk/aarhus/gode-muligheder-for-at-bevare-jyllands-svar-paa-christiania|archive-date=9 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Cityscape==
{{see also|Architecture of Aarhus}}
{{wide image|Panorama of Aarhus.jpg|1200px|Panoramic view of the Aarhus skyline, seen from the top of [[ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum|ARoS]] (2012)}}
Aarhus has developed in stages, from the Viking Age to modern times, all visible in the city today. Many architectural styles are represented in different parts of the city such as [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]], [[National Romantic Style|National Romantic]], [[Nordic Classicism]], [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]], [[Empire style|Empire]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/|title=Arkitektur og byggeskik i byen|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|access-date=14 December 2014|language=da|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130914192312/http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/|archive-date=14 September 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The city has developed around the main transport hubs – the river, the harbour, and later the railway station – and as a result, the oldest parts are also the most central and busiest today.<ref name=dhdk>{{cite web |title=Aarhus |url=https://danmarkshistorien.dk/vis/materiale/aarhus |publisher=DanmarksHistoriendk |access-date=25 January 2023 |language=da}}</ref>

The streets of [[Volden, Aarhus|Volden]] (The Rampart) and [[Graven, Aarhus|Graven]] (The Moat) testify to the defences of the initial Viking town, and ''Allégaderingen'' in [[Midtbyen, Aarhus|Midtbyen]] roughly follows the boundaries of that settlement. The street network in the [[Midtbyen (Aarhus)|inner city]] formed during the Middle Ages with narrow, curved streets and low, dense housing by the river and the coast. ''Vesterport'' (Westward Gate) still bears the name of the medieval city gate and the narrow alleyways ''Posthussmøgen'' and ''Telefonsmøgen'' are remnants of toll stations from that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reader.livedition.dk/aarhuskommune/188/|title=Kulturhistorisk redegørelse 2013|publisher=Aarhus Kommune|access-date=14 December 2014|language=da}}</ref> The inner city has the oldest preserved buildings, especially the [[Latinerkvarteret, Aarhus|Latin Quarter]], with houses dating back to the early 17th&nbsp;century in [[Mejlgade]] and [[Skolegade]].{{sfn|Olsen|2000|p=124}} Medieval merchants' mansions with courtyards can be seen in [[Klostergade]], [[Studsgade]] and Skolegade. By far, the largest part of the present-day city was built during and after the industrialization of the late 1800s, and the most represented architectural styles today are [[historicism (art)|historicism]] and [[modernist architecture|modernism]], especially the subgenre of [[Functionalism (architecture)#Nordic "funkis"|Danish functionalism]] of which there are many fine examples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kulturhusaarhus.dk/arkitektur-i-aarhus-moderne-og-modernistisk/|title=Arkitektur i Århus – moderne og modernistisk|publisher=Kulturhuset|author=Mikkelhede|date=8 October 2020|access-date=25 January 2023 |language=da}}</ref> The building boom of the 2000s has imprinted itself on Aarhus with a redeveloped harbourfront, many new neighbourhoods (also in the inner city), and a revitalized public space. It is also beginning to change the skyline with several dominating high-rises.<ref name=dhdk/>

===Developments===
In recent years, Aarhus has experienced a large demand in housing and offices, spurring a construction boom in some parts of the city. The newly built city district of Aarhus Ø, formerly docklands, includes major housing developments, mostly consisting of privately owned apartments, designed by architects such as [[CEBRA]], and [[JDS Architects]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.troldtekt.com/inspiration/architecture-in-the-big-cities/the-seagulls-have-taken-off-and-the-architecture-is-coming-into-its-own/|title=The seagulls have taken off, and the architecture is coming into its own|publisher=Troldtekt|access-date=25 January 2023|archive-date=25 January 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230125125213/https://www.troldtekt.com/inspiration/architecture-in-the-big-cities/the-seagulls-have-taken-off-and-the-architecture-is-coming-into-its-own/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archello.com/project/the-iceberg|title=The Iceberg|publisher=archello|access-date=25 January 2023}}</ref>

==Culture==
Aarhus is home to many annual cultural events and festivals, museums, theatres, and sports events of both national and international importance, and presents some of the largest cultural attractions in Denmark. There is a long tradition of music from all genres, and many Danish bands have emerged from Aarhus. Libraries, cultural centres and educational institutions present free or easy opportunities for the citizens to participate in, engage in, or be creative with cultural events and productions of all kinds.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ballard |first=Barclay |title=Aarhus finds success as European Capital of Culture |url=https://www.businessdestinations.com/featured/aarhus-finds-success-as-european-capital-of-culture/ |publisher=Business Destination |date=28 August 2018 |access-date=25 January 2023}}</ref>

Since 1938, Aarhus has marketed itself as ''Smilets by'' (City of smiles) which has become both an informal moniker and official slogan. In 2011, the city council opted to change the slogan to "Aarhus. Danish for Progress" but it was unpopular and abandoned after just a few years.<ref name="Stads_Smil">{{cite web|url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Smilets_by|title=Smilets by|publisher=Aarhus City Archives|language=da|access-date=29 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231170714/http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Smilets_by|archive-date=31 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Other slogans that have occasionally been used are ''Byen ved havet'' (City by the sea), ''Mellem bugt og bøgeskov'' (Between bay and beechwood) and ''Verdens mindste storby'' (World's smallest big city).<ref name="Stift_Plakat">{{cite news|url=http://stiften.dk/kultur/Gammel-plakat-er-en-bestseller/artikel/348018|title=Gammel plakat er en bestseller|newspaper=[[Århus Stiftstidende]]|language=da|access-date=29 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231170509/http://stiften.dk/kultur/Gammel-plakat-er-en-bestseller/artikel/348018|archive-date=31 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="eb">{{cite web|url=http://ekstrabladet.dk/ferie/ferie-i-danmark/verdens-mindste-storby-hjem-til-aarhus/6449526|title=Verdens mindste storby: Hjem til Aarhus|work=[[Ekstra Bladet]]|date=17 December 2016 |language=da|access-date=12 January 2017}}</ref> Aarhus is featured in popular songs such as ''Hjem til Aarhus'' by [[På Slaget 12]], ''Lav sol over Aarhus'' by [[Gnags]], ''8000 Aarhus C'' by [[Flemming Jørgensen]], ''Pigen ud af Aarhus'' by [[Tina Dickow]] and ''Slingrer ned ad Vestergade'' by [[Gnags]]. In 1919, the number ''Sangen til Aarhus'' (Song to Aarhus) had become a popular hit for a time, but the oldest and perhaps best known "national anthem" for the city is the classical ''Aarhus Tappenstreg'' from 1872 by [[Carl Christian Møller]] which is occasionally played at official events or at performances by local marching bands and orchestras.<ref name="DansMus-Rødder">{{cite web|url=http://ringstedfolkedansere.dk/DMR%20og%20DMH/DMR-14%20Aarhus%20Tappenstreg%20(HjLiv%201997-03).pdf|title=Arhus Tappenstreg|publisher=Dansens og musikkens rødder|language=da|access-date=29 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101000945/http://ringstedfolkedansere.dk/DMR%20og%20DMH/DMR-14%20Aarhus%20Tappenstreg%20(HjLiv%201997-03).pdf|archive-date=1 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Rosa">{{cite web|url=https://www.rosa.org/vennelystviser-sunget-af-dorthe-kollo/|title=Vennelystviser sunget af Dorthe Kollo|publisher=ROSA|language=da|access-date=29 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101001114/https://www.rosa.org/vennelystviser-sunget-af-dorthe-kollo/|archive-date=1 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[public library|Public libraries]] in Denmark are also cultural and community centres. They play an active role in cultural life and host many events, exhibitions, discussion groups, workshops, educational courses and facilitate everyday cultural activities for and by the citizens.

Aarhus is known for its musical history. Fuelled by a relatively young population [[jazz]] clubs sprang up in the 1950s which became a tour stop for many iconic American Jazz musicians. By the 1960s, the music scene diversified into rock and other genres and in the 1970s and 1980s, Aarhus became a centre for rock music, fostering iconic bands such as [[Kliché]], [[TV-2 (band)|TV-2]] and [[Gnags]] and artists such as [[Thomas Helmig]] and [[Anne Linnet]]. Acclaimed bands since the 1970s include [[Under Byen]], [[Michael Learns to Rock]], [[Nephew (band)|Nephew]], [[Carpark North]], [[Spleen United]], [[Veto (band)|VETO]], [[Hatesphere]] and [[Illdisposed]] in addition to individual performers such as [[Medina (singer)|Medina]] and [[Tina Dico]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Kullberg |first=Erling |title=1966-76: When Aarhus became the new music metropolis of Denmark |url=https://seismograf.org/en/node/8592 |publisher=Seismograf |date=October 2016 |access-date=25 January 2023}}</ref>

There are two public sea baths, the northern ''[[Den Permanente]]'' below Riis Skov and close to the harbour area, and the southern [[Ballehage Beach]] in the Marselisborg Forests. As in most of Denmark, there are no private beaches in the municipality, but access to ''Den Permanente'' requires a membership, except in the summer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitaarhus.dk/aarhus/natur/en-tur-paa-stranden|title=En Tur På Stranden|publisher=VisitAarhus|access-date=10 December 2014|language=da|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213015054/http://www.visitaarhus.dk/aarhus/natur/en-tur-paa-stranden|archive-date=13 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Vendors of street food are numerous throughout the centre, often selling from small trailers on permanent locations formally known as ''[[Pølsevogn]]e'' (lit. sausage wagons), traditionally serving a Danish variety of [[hot dog]]s, sausages and other fast food.

Aarhus has a robust and diverse nightlife. The action tends to concentrate in the inner city, with the pedestrianised riverside, Frederiksgade, the Latin Quarter, and Jægergårdsgade on Frederiksbjerg as the most active centres at night, but things are stirring elsewhere around the city too. The nightlife scene offers everything from small joints with cheap alcohol and a homely atmosphere to fashionable nightclubs serving champagne and cocktails or small and large music venues with bars, dance floors and lounges. A short selection of well-established places where you can have a drink and socialise, include the fashionable lounge and night club Kupé at the harbourfront, the relaxed Ris Ras Filliongongong offering [[Hookah|waterpipes]] and an award-winning beer selection, Fatter Eskild with a broad selection of Danish bands playing mostly blues and rock, the [[Wine bar|wine]] and [[book café]] Løve's in Nørregade, ''Sherlock Holmes'', a British-style [[pub]] with live music, and the [[brew pub]] of Sct.

===Local dialect===
{{see also|Danish dialects}}
The Aarhus dialect, commonly called ''Aarhusiansk'' (Aarhusian in English), is a [[Jutlandic dialect]] in the [[Danish dialects|Mid-Eastern Jutland dialect area]], traditionally spoken in and around Aarhus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dialekt.ku.dk/dialekter/jysk/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313225417/http://dialekt.ku.dk/dialekter/jysk/ |archive-date=13 March 2016 |title=Jysk |publisher=[[University of Copenhagen]] |language=da |access-date=6 January 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> Aarhusian, as with most local dialects in Denmark, has diminished in use through the 20th century and most Danes today speak some version of Standard Danish with slight regional features. Aarhusian, however, still has a strong presence in older segments of the population and in areas with high numbers of immigrants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/ECE1852264/saarn-bevarer-etniske-unge-aarhusiansk-ikkaa/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126013238/http://politiken.dk/kultur/ECE1852264/saarn-bevarer-etniske-unge-aarhusiansk-ikkaa/ |archive-date=26 January 2016 |title=Saarn bevarer etniske unge ikkaa |work=[[Politiken]] |date=25 December 2012 |language=da |access-date=6 January 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://stiften.dk/dagens-portraet/hun-fandt-den-aarhusianske-dialekt-i-aarhus-v |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505041916/http://stiften.dk/dagens-portraet/hun-fandt-den-aarhusianske-dialekt-i-aarhus-v |archive-date=5 May 2016 |title=Hun fandt den Aarhusianske dialekt i Aarhus V |newspaper=[[Århus Stiftstidende]] |language=da |access-date=6 January 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://stiften.dk/aarhus/vi-snakker-mindre-aarhusiansk-do |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501230900/http://stiften.dk/aarhus/vi-snakker-mindre-aarhusiansk-do |archive-date=1 May 2016 |title=Vi snakker mindre Aarhusiansk do |newspaper=[[Århus Stiftstidende]] |language=da |access-date=6 January 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> Some examples of common, traditional and unique Aarhusian words are: ''træls'' ('tiresome'), ''noller'' ('silly' or 'dumb') and ''dælme'' ([[Phrasal exclamation|excl]].

In 1998, it merged with ''Randers Amtsavis'' and is now run by Midtjyske Medier, part of [[Berlingske Media]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Massemedier/Medier_og_dagblade,_Danmark/%C3%85rhus_Stiftstidende |title=Århus Stiftstidende |publisher=[[Gyldendal]] |access-date=21 July 2014}}</ref> The daily newspaper of {{lang|da|[[Jyllands-Posten]]}} was established in 1871 in Aarhus, and takes a generally right-wing editorial approach. With a reputation as a serious news publication, the paper has always included news from [[Jutland]] in particular, but somewhat less so since its promotion as a national newspaper in the 1960s. Today it is one of the three bestselling serious newspapers in Denmark, the others being ''[[Berlingske]]'' and ''[[Politiken]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jette Drachmann Søllinge |url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Massemedier/Medier_og_dagblade,_Danmark/Jyllands-Posten |title=Jyllands Posten in The Great Danish |work=Jyllands-Posten |publisher=[[Gyldendal]] |access-date=21 July 2014 |language=da}}</ref> Jyllands-Posten publishes ''JP Aarhus'', a section dedicated to news in and around Aarhus, and hosted a free cityguide website from 2010 to 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/ |title=JP Aarhus |work=Jyllands-Posten |access-date=5 February 2016 |archive-date=2 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202135343/http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/erhverv/article4473815.ece|title=Jyllands-Posten øger satsningen i Århus |trans-title=Jyllands-Posten increase the bet in Århus |work=Jyllands-Posten|date=11 March 2010 |access-date=10 October 2017}}</ref> The Copenhagen-based media company of ''Politiken'', also publishes several [[free newspaper|free local papers]] once a week in parts of Denmark and Sweden.

It was bought from ''Århus Stiftstidende'' in June 2017, but has been published for many years previous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalisten.dk/stiften-tillidsmand-sikkert-godt-andre-steder-men-ikke-her|title=Sikkert godt andre steder – men ikke her|trans-title=Probably good elsewhere - but not here|language=da|first=Kerstin|last=Bruun-Hansen|publisher=Journalisten|date=16 June 2017|access-date=1 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-pages.dk/aarhusonsdag/391|title=Aarhus Onsdag - 26-06-2018|website=www.e-pages.dk}}</ref>
