[[Tenali Ramakrishna|Tenali Rama]], one of the jesters and eight poets of the early 16th century [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]] ruler  [[Krishnadevaraya]], hailed from Tenali.

== Etymology ==
The word ''Tenali'' is derived from ''Teravali''.<ref name=vgtmuda /> Local lore claims that the word is a misnomer of Tella Naali, meaning White Naali tree. The white colour bark is an uncommon occurrence of Holoptelea integrifolia(Indian Elm), which is found in abundance around the town.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Brown |first=Charles Philip |date=1903 |title=A Telugu-English Dictionary.

Three canals of the Krishna River flow through Tenali City, making it a part of the rice bowl of Andhra Pradesh, resembling Paris, where three canals pass through the city. Hence Tenali is affectionately called "Andhra Paris". In 2011 the city limits were expanded by many kilometers. The expansion included the villages of [[Angalakuduru]], [[Nandivelugu]], [[Kolakaluru]], [[Pinapadu]], and [[Burripalem]].
