'''Probolinggo''' ({{langx|id|Kota Probolinggo}}, [[Javanese language|Javanese]]/{{langx|mad|Prabâlingghâ}}) is a city on the north coast of [[East Java]] province, [[Indonesia]]. It covers an area of 56.676 sq.&nbsp;km, and had a population of 217,062 at the 2010 census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 239,649 at the 2020 census;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 246,980 (comprising 122,574 males and 124,406 females). <ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Probolinggo Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.3574)</ref> It is surrounded on the landward side by [[Probolinggo Regency]] of which it was formerly the capital, but it is now not part of the regency.

Like most of northern East Java, the city has a large [[Madurese people|Madurese]] population in addition to many ethnically [[Javanese people]]. It is located on one of the major highways across [[Java (island)|Java]], and has a harbor that is heavily used by [[fishing]] vessels.

Under the [[Dutch East Indies]] colonial administration, especially in the 19th century, Probolinggo was a lucrative regional center for refining and exporting [[sugar]], and sugar remains an important product of the area.

The city is famous for its [[mango]]es, locally called ''mangga manalagi''. Strong [[Foehn wind|dry-season winds]] from July to September, the ''angin gending'', help the mango trees [[pollinate]] and are sometimes credited with being the source of the area's quality fruit. The city formerly produced [[grape]]s as well, but few grapes are grown in the area now.

The motto of the city is Bestari which is an abbreviation of ''bersih'' (cleanliness), ''sehat'' (healthy), ''tertib'' (orderly), ''aman'' (safe), ''rapi'' (neat), and ''indah'' (beautiful).

== Name ==

[[File:Bupati Probolinggo Raden Toemenggoeng Djojonegoro.jpg|thumb|250px|Raden Toemenggoeng Djojonegoro, The second regent of Probolinggo]]
In [[Negarakertagama]], the city was called '''Banger''' which means ''bad odor'' in Javanese. In 1770, Regent Djojonegoro changed the city's name to '''Probolinggo'''. The name derives from ''praba'' (light) and ''lingga'' ([symbol of] masculinity). Another version of the etymology is that the name derives from ''prabu'' (king) and ''linggih'' (stop by).{{sfn|Sapto|2020|p=10-11}}

== History ==
=== Colonial era ===
[[File:Regentswoning te Probolinggo, KITLV 5117.tiff|thumb|250px|Probolinggo town square during colonial times]]
[[File:Haven van Probolinggo, KITLV 4086.tiff|thumb|250px|The old port of Probolinggo]]

As a result of Mataram's involvement in [[Geger Pacinan]] (and subsequent [[Java War (1741–1743)|war]]), [[Dutch East India Company]] signed an agreement with Sunan Pakubuwono II on 11 November 1743 to hand over most of eastern Java, including Probolinggo, to the former.{{sfn|Sapto|2020|p=12}}
In 1811, under Dutch East Indies' Governor General [[Daendels]] rule, Probolinggo was sold to a Chinese man Han Tik-Ko. The agreed price was 1 million ringgit paid in installment for 10 years. He then was given titles of "Mayor Cina" (Chinese mayor) and "Tuan Tanah Probolinggo" ("Probolinggo Lanlord") that had similar authority as bupati (regent). Meanwhile, Probolinggo resident called him  "Babah Tumenggung".{{sfn|Sapto|2020|p=15-17}}

Under Han Tik-Ko, Probolinggo residents were not satisfied of Han Tik-Ko since he imposed heavy tax to them. As a result, on 18 May 1813, a clash happened between the rebellious residents and Han Tik-Ko people. The event was called Perang Kedopok/Kepruk Cino (Kedopok War/Hit the Chinese) in which Han Tik-Ko was killed. The Dutch East Indies Lieutenant Governor [[Stamford Raffles]] then bought back the city from Han Tik-Ko's family.{{sfn|Sapto|2020|p=17}}

The ruler of Probolinggo between 1818 and 1821 was Raden Tumenggung Aryo Notoadiningrat, while in 1823 the ruler was Raden Tumenggung Panji Notonegoro.{{sfn|Sapto|2020|p=17-18}}

=== Early independence ===
After Japanese surrendered to Allied forces, there was repatriation of Japanese soldiers by Allied force. In Probolinggo, on 29 April 1946 around 1,200 prisoners of war were returned by two ships "Bansiu Maru 3" and "Mashi Maru 6" departed from Probolinggo port.{{sfn|Sapto|2020|p=61-62}}

=== Indonesia National Revolution ===
On 12 April 1947 23:30 3&nbsp;km from shore near Probolinggo port, a Dutch ship seized and searched a wooden ship called "Boeroehan" and found nothing. In the next day on 11:00 the latter ship was released and 5 minutes later the Dutch ship sailed away and disappeared to northwest. On 13 April 08:45, another Dutch ship went back and forth 5&nbsp;km from the shore and went to east.{{sfn|Sapto|2020|p=63-64}}

On 23 May 1947, there were 3 Dutch ships spying for Probolinggo. On 06:15, one of the ship searched and seized "Merdeka" ship departing for Tangklok, Sampang, on which then Madura resident boarded it. The latter ship was later released on 07:45. Another ship named "Kembangsari" and several other fishing boats were also either searched for or chased away.{{sfn|Sapto|2020|p=64}}

Dewan Pertahanan Daerah Probolinggo (Probolinggo Regional Defense Council) then strengthened the naval defense of the area to face more Dutch ships attacking via sea. As a result, the Dutch later entered the city via land.{{sfn|Sapto|2020|p=64-65}}

== Government ==
Administration of Probolinggo city (kota) and regency (kabupaten) had repeatedly been separated and merged. There were separation of government of Probolinggo city (kotapraja) and regency based on Ordonantie dated 20 June 1918. But, according on Ordonantie 9 August 1928, the city was abolished and the area was merged again to the regency.{{sfn|Sapto|2020|p=19}}

Under [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupation]], the administrations were once again separated.{{sfn|Sapto|2020|p=19}} The city (under Japanese rule, the level was called ''shi'') mayor (shico) was Gapar Wiryosudibyo, a middle school teacher, while the regency (''ken'') regent was Nyais Wiryosubroto. Both Probolinggo (shi and ken) were under an administration of Malang-shu (residency).{{sfn|Sapto|2020|p=43-44}}

During [[Indonesian National Revolution|National Revolution]], on 13 August 1948 the city was abolished again and was absorbed into the regency. Then since the [[Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference|Dutch recognition of Indonesian independence]], the city and regency were separated again.{{sfn|Sapto|2020|p=19}}

== Administrative districts ==

[[File:Peta kecamatan-kecamatan di Kota Probolinggo.png|thumb|300px|The map of districts in Probolinggo City]]
Probolinggo city consists of five [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan''), tabulated below with their areas and their population totals from the 2010 census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and the 2020 census,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> together with the official estimates as at mid 2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Probolinggo Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.3574)</ref> The table also includes the number of [[administrative village]]s (all classed as urban ''kelurahan'') in each district and its postal codes. Each district centre has the same name as the district itself.

== Transportation ==
Probolinggo once had a tram system spanning across the city. The service was built in 1894 and was operated by Probolinggo Stoomtram Maatschappij.{{sfn|Sapto|2020|p=21}}

Probolinggo is a hub city where its main road connect three major city in East java, [[Surabaya]] to the west (through Pasuruan and Sidoarjo), Jember to the south through Lumajang, and [[Banyuwangi]] to the east through Situbondo. Public buses to many major cities are available in Banyuangga bus terminal.

Since 2019, the [[Trans-java toll road]] has been completed and provide faster route to the capital [[Jakarta]], which cuts down travel time significantly to only 9 to 10 hour drive from previously 16 to 20 hours.

The city is served by [[:id:Stasiun Probolinggo|Probolinggo railway station]] that covers most routes to major cities in Java. However, there are no direct train to the capital Jakarta, so travelers to Jakarta have to transit via either [[Surabaya]] or [[Yogyakarta]].
