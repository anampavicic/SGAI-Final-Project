== History ==
The area of Uwajima was part of ancient [[Iyo Province]]. [[Dōgo Onsen]] was already famous in the [[Asuka period]], and [[Shōtoku Taishi]] visited the spa in the year 596. It is also mentioned in passing in ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''. At the end of the [[Heian period]], Kōno Michinobu supported [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] against the [[Heike clan]] during the [[Genpei War]] and was awarded with a position as ''[[shugo]]'' of Iyo Province. In the [[Muromachi period]], the clan made their stronghold at [[Yuzuki Castle]], near Dōgo Onsen, and developed the port of [[Mitsuhama]] to the west to link the area to [[Honshū]] and [[Kyūshū]]. The clan was conquered by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] during his invasion of Shikoku, and later the area became part of [[Iyo-Matsuyama Domain]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. A ''[[jōkamachi]]'' developed around  [[Matsuyama Castle (Iyo)|Matsuyama Castle]], and this is the core of the modern city. The city was established with the creation of the modern municipality system on December 15, 1889. The city was bombed on July 26, 1945, in the final stages of [[World War II]], with 251 civilians killed and over 55% of the city area destroyed.

In the twentieth century, various [[Onsen District, Ehime|mergers]] joined Matsuyama with neighboring towns of [[Dōgo Onsen|Dōgo]], [[Mitsuhama]], and other townships, aided by [[urban sprawl]], creating a seamless modern city that now ranks as the largest in Shikoku. On October 1, 2018, Matsuyama absorbed the city of [[Hōjō, Ehime|Hōjō]], and town of [[Nakajima, Ehime|Nakajima]] (from the former [[Onsen District, Ehime|Onsen District]]).

==Government==
Matsuyama has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 42 members. Matsuyama, together with Kumakōgen, contributes 16 members to the Ehime Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is split between Ehime 1st district And Ehime 2nd district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Matsuyama is a major regional commercial center. Key industries include agriculture represented by [[mandarin orange]]s, tourism centered around Dōgo Onsen and Matsuyama Castle, and manufacturing centered on chemical fibers. Industrial areas spread along the coast near airports and harbors, including the Teijin Group's largest production base, and factories of Miura ([[boiler]] manufacturer), [[Iseki]] ([[tractor]] and engine equipment),<ref>"[http://www.iseki.co.jp/english/company/profile/ Company Outline]." [[Iseki]]. Retrieved on March 31, 2018.</ref> Hatada Ichiroku (Japanese style [[confectionery]]), Poem, a food processing division of Pom (Ehime Drink Company), and the [[Retailer|retailing]] companies Fuji and Daiki all have their headquarters in Matsuyama.

[[File:Dogo-station2004-7-3.jpg|thumb|right|Botchan Ressha at Dogo Station, Matsuyama]]

The city is known for its [[hot springs]] ([[onsen]]), among the oldest in Japan, and is home to the [[Dōgo Onsen|Dōgo Onsen Honkan]], a Meiji Period wooden public bathhouse dating from 1894.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5502.html|title=Dogo Onsen}}</ref> A second favorite tourist spot is [[Matsuyama Castle (Iyo)|Matsuyama Castle]]. Eight of the eighty-eight temples in the [[Shikoku Pilgrimage]] are in Matsuyama.

Buddhist temples in Matsuyama include [[Ishite-ji]] (石手寺), [[Taisan-ji (Matsuyama)|Taisan-ji]] (太山寺), and [[Jōdo-ji (Matsuyama)|Jōdo-ji]] (浄土寺), all dating back to the 8th century, although the oldest surviving buildings are from the early 14th century, as well as [[Hōgon-ji (Matsuyama)|Hōgon-ji]] (宝厳寺), [[Taihō-ji (Matsuyama)|Taihō-ji]] (大宝寺) and [[Enmyō-ji (Matsuyama)|Enmyō-ji]] (円明寺). Shrines of the city include [[Isaniwa Jinja]] (伊佐爾波神社), built in 1667.

The [[haiku]] poet [[Masaoka Shiki]] lived in Matsuyama. His house, now known as the [[Shiki-do]], and a museum, the [[Shiki Memorial Museum]], are popular attractions, and the centerpieces of the city's claim as a center of the international haiku movement. Other haiku poets associated with Matsuyama include [[Kurita Chodō]], whose [[Kōshin-an]] was visited by [[Kobayashi Issa]], Shiki's followers, [[Takahama Kyoshi]] and [[Kawahigashi Hekigoto]], and [[Taneda Santōka]]. Santoka's house, known as Isso-an, is also a tourist attraction and is periodically open to the public. The Matsuyama Declaration of 1999 proposed the formation of the International Haiku Research Center, and the first [[Masaoka Shiki International Haiku Awards]] were given in 2000. Recipients have included [[Yves Bonnefoy]] (2000), [[Cor van den Heuvel]] (2002) and [[Gary Snyder]] (2004).

The famed novel ''[[Botchan]]'' by [[Natsume Sōseki]] is set in Matsuyama. As a result, there are numerous sites and locales named after the main character, including [[Botchan Stadium]], the [[Botchan Ressha]] (an antique train that runs on the city's tramway), and Botchan [[dango]].

Matsuyama also figures in several works by [[Shiba Ryōtarō]], notably his popular novel, ''[[Saka no Ue no Kumo]]'' [Clouds Above the Hill] (1969).  In anticipation of the upcoming [[NHK]] [[Taiga drama]] [[Saka no Ue no Kumo (TV series)|adaptation of ''Saka no Ue no Kumo'']], a [[Saka no Ue no Kumo Museum]] was established in 2007.

Matsuyama was also the setting of a 1907 novel about the [[Russo-Japanese War]], ''As the Hague Ordains'', by American writer [[Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore]]. Matsuyama figures in the novel because the city housed a camp for Russian prisoners during the war. A Russian cemetery commemorates this important episode in Matsuyama history. The [[Russo-Japanese War]] is also remembered in Matsuyama because of the contributions of two Japanese military leaders, the Akiyama brothers, [[Akiyama Saneyuki]] and [[Akiyama Yoshifuru]], who were born in the city.

Matsuyama has several important museums.  [[The Museum of Art, Ehime]] is the city's main art museum, its collections emphasizing the works of regional artists.  The [[Shiki Memorial Museum]] is a museum that focuses on the life and work of [[Masaoka Shiki]], with special attention to his contribution to [[haiku]]. The [[Saka no Ue no Kumo Museum]] features exhibits connected with the novel and television series.  There is a [[Juzo Itami]] museum dedicated to the film director.

Products ([[meibutsu]]) of Matsuyama include [[tart]]s and Botchan [[dango]]. In the 17th century, the lord of Matsuyama castle Sadayuki Matsudaira (松平定行) introduced the process of tart-making, originally brought to Japan by the Portuguese, to Matsuyama. At first it was a [[Castella]] with jam. According to legend Sadayuki made some changes, such as adding [[red bean paste]]. Now there are many kinds and makers of tarts in Matsuyama; some add [[yuzu]] paste or [[chestnut]] to the red bean paste. In addition to tarts, [[Botchan dango]] is also a product of Matsuyama. Botchan dango was named after the novel ''[[Botchan]]'' by [[Natsume Sōseki]]. It consists of three bean paste beads of three flavors, [[matcha]], egg, and red bean paste.  Within the paste is contained [[Mochi (food)|mochi]].

Matsuyama is the site of a number of festivals, including the Dogo Festival, held in the spring, the Matsuyama Festival, held in August, and the Fall Festival, held in October, which features battling [[mikoshi]].
