'''Pematangsiantar''' (sometimes written as '''Pematang Siantar''', acronym '''PS''' or ''P. Siantar'', colloquially just '''Siantar'''), and also known as the '''City of Pematangsiantar''',<ref>{{cite web|title=Official Website of Pematangsiantar City (In Indonesian)|url=https://www.pematangsiantar.go.id}}</ref> is an independent city in [[North Sumatra]] Province of [[Indonesia]], surrounded by, but not part of, the [[Simalungun Regency]], making Pematangsiantar an [[enclave and exclave|enclave]] within Simalungun Regency. Pematangsiantar formerly had the status of a second-level district (''daerah tingkat dua'') and was the administrative centre of the surrounding Regency, but in 1986 it was elevated to ''Kota'' (City) and separated from the Regency.

Its population was 229,525 in the 2005 Intermediate Census, 234,698 in the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 268,254 in the 2020 Census.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> The official estimate as of mid-2023 was 274,838, making it the second-largest city in the province after the provincial capital of [[Medan]].<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Pematangsiantar Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.1272)</ref>

Pematangsiantar is 128&nbsp;km from [[Medan]] and 50&nbsp;km from the renowned [[Lake Toba]] tourist centre of [[Parapat]] and is often a transit city for tourists who want to travel to Lake Toba and [[Central Tapanuli Regency]]. As a city that supports tourism in the surrounding area, the city has 8 hotels, 10 budget hotels, and 268 restaurants. There are still many old (1950s) model English-manufactured [[Birmingham Small Arms Company]] (BSA)  motorcycles with a capacity of 500 cc used as [[Auto rickshaw]]s which are recognized by their distinctive loud sound.

The city received the ''Adipura Cup'' in 1993 for its cleanliness and environmental sustainability. In 1996, because of orderly traffic control, the city also won the ''Wahana Tata Nugraha'' Cup award. The industrial sector is the backbone of the city's economy, due to its central location in Simalungun Regency, and consists of medium to large industrial sites. Of the total economic activities in 2000, Pematangsiantar reached a GDP of Rp1.69 trillion, with the industrial market share making up 38.18% or Rp646 billion. The trade, hotel, and restaurant sectors followed in second place, with a contribution of 22.77% or Rp385 billion.

The motto of this city is '''Sapangambei Manoktok Hitei''' which comes from the Simalungun language which means working together to achieve a noble goal.

==History==
Before 1907, Pematangsiantar was a Kingdom led by the [[Damanik]]. Damanik is one of the clans of the [[Simalungun]] ethnic group of the [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]] people. The last independent king of the dynasty was Tuan Sangnawaluh Damanik. In 1907, the Dutch took control, turning Pematangsiantar into their colony. The city remained under Dutch control until 1942 when the Japanese invaded and ruled over Indonesia.

After Indonesia proclaimed its freedom in 1945, Pematangsiantar was granted autonomous status. In 1974, Pematangsiantar became a second-level district and was appointed as the capital of [[Simalungun Regency]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Pematangsiantar history (in Indonesian)|url=http://www.pematangsiantarkota.go.id/sejarah.php|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522080612/http://www.pematangsiantarkota.go.id/sejarah.php|archive-date=2008-05-22}}</ref>

=== Siantar Kingdom ===
Before the Proclamation of Independence of the Republic of Indonesia, Pematangsiantar was a royal town. Pematangsiantar is domiciled in ''Pulau Holing'', and the last independent king of this dynasty was a descendant of the ''Damanik'' clan, namely ''Tuan Sang Nawaluh Damanik'' who held power as king until 1907. Descendants of this king still hold ceremonial titles as 'Raja Siantar' which are recognized by the Simalungan people even today.

Around ''Pulau Holing'' then developed into a village where residents lived including the villages of ''Suhi Haluan, Siantar Bayu, Suhi Kahean, Pantoan, Suhi Bah Bosar'', and ''Tomuan''. These areas later became the legal areas of Pematangsiantar City, namely:

* ''Pulau Holing'' becomes ''Kampung Pematang''
* ''Siantar Bayu'' becomes the Siantar city center
* ''Suhi Kahean'' became ''Kampung Sipinggol-pinggol, Kampung Melayu, Martoba, Sukadame'', and ''Bane''.
* ''Suhi Bah Bosar'' became a ''Kampung Kristen, Karo, Tomuan, Pantoan, Toba'' and ''Marimbang''.

=== Dutch and Japanese Colonial Era ===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Straatgezicht met het Juliana Hotel Pematangsiantar TMnr 10015092.jpg|thumb|left|Street scene in Pematangsiantar in the 1910s]]
North Sumatra was one of the last areas in Indonesia annexed by the Netherlands. After the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch]] entered North Sumatra, the Simalungun area became the Dutch territory, and in 1907 the independent reign of the kings ended. The Dutch controller, who was originally based in Commerce, was transferred to Pematangsiantar in 1907. Since then Pematangsiantar has developed into an area visited by many newcomers,[[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]], and [[Indian Indonesian|Indian]] communities inhabit the ''Timbang Galung'' and ''Kampung Melayu'' area, with ethnic [[Javanese people|Javanese]] centered in ''Tanah Jawa''.

In 1910 the Pematangsiantar City Preparatory Agency was established. On July 1, 1917, based on Stad Blad No. 285, Pematangsiantar was designated as a [[Municipalities of the Netherlands|Gemeente]] (dutch-style administrative division) with its autonomy. After January 1939 changes to the structure of the Gemeente Council were made under Stad Blad No. 717.

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Luchtfoto van Siantar TMnr 10015093.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of Siantar in 1938]]
The forces of Imperial Japan invaded and conquered the Dutch in Sumatra in 1942. In this Japanese era (1942-1945) the political structure was changed by the Japanese administration to Siantar State and the Council was abolished. Based on Law No. 22/1948, Gemente's status became the City of Simalungun Regency, and the Mayor of the city was concurrently the Regent of Simalungun. This arrangement continued after independence until 1957.

=== Independence and Contemporary Era ===
After the Proclamation of Indonesian independence, Pematangsiantar again became an Autonomous Region. Based on Law No.1/1957 it was designated a Full City Praja, and with the issuance of Law No.18/1965, the status was changed to that of a City. With the issuance of Law no. 5/1974 'Concerning the Principles of Regional Government' the status was changed to Pematangsiantar Level II Regional City. This is the current status of the city.

Based on Government Regulation No. 35 of 1981, Pematangsiantar Level II Regional City was divided into four administrative districts (''kecamatan'') consisting of 29 urban villages (''kelurahan'') with an area of 12.48&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, as inaugurated by the Governor of North Sumatra on March 17, 1982. The number of districts in Pematangsiantar City is now eight districts consisting of a total of fifty-three urban villages (''kelurahan'').

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Pematangsiantar has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] (Af) with heavy rainfall year-round. The temperatures are slightly moderated by the city's elevation.
