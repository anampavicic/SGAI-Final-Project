==Administration==
The region of Logone Occidental is divided into four [[Departments of Chad|departments]], namely, [[Dodjé]] (capital [[Beinamar]]), Guéni (capital Krim Krim), [[Lac Wey Department|Lac Wey]] (capital [[Moundou]]) and [[Ngourkosso]] (capital Benoye). As a part of decentralisation in February 2003, the country was administratively split into regions, departments, municipalities and rural communities. The prefectures, which were originally 14 in number, were re-designated into 17 regions. The regions are administered by Governors appointed by the President. The Prefects, who originally held the responsibility of the 14 prefects, still retained the titles and were responsible for the administration of smaller departments in each region. The members of local assemblies are elected every six years, while the executive organs are elected every three years.<ref>{{cite report|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un/unpan023258.pdf|page=9|title=Republic of Chad Public Administration and Country profile|format=PDF|accessdate=17 November 2016|publisher=Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), United Nations|year=2004}}</ref> As of 2016, there are totally 23 regions in Chad, which are divided based on population and administrative convenience.<ref>{{cite report|title=Chad district map|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/chad.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=20 November 2016|publisher=Department of Field Support,Cartographic Section, United Nations}}</ref>
