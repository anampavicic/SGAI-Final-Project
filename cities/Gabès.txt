It is located on the coast of the [[Gulf of Gabès]]. With a population of 167,863, Gabès is the [[Tunisia#Major cities|6th largest Tunisian city]].<ref name="Gabesmun"/> Gabes is 327 km away from [[Tunis]] and 113 km away from [[Sfax]].

==History==

===Etymology===
Takapes, the ancient name of Gabès, is a [[Punic]] [[Numidian language|Numidian]] ([[Berber languages|Berber]]) toponym. Later, the prefix "Ta" (meaning "the" in Punic) was dropped, and the place became known as Kapes. As in [[Arabic]] the sound /p/ is unknown, Kapes became known as Kabes, and later known as Gabès.

=== Roman period ===
Gabès is the ancient ''Tacapae''<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=YnYjGTh88ZQC&pg=PA123 D. L. Bomgardner, ''Story of the Roman Amphitheatre''] (Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|978-1-13470739-3}}), p. 123</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rH26vL2CWbkC&pg=PA15 Paul Lachlan MacKendrick, ''The North African Stones Speak''] (UNC Press 2000 {{ISBN|978-0-80784942-2}}), p. 15</ref> or ''Tacape'' (Τακάπη in [[Ancient greek]])  or ''Tacapes''<ref>[http://www.trismegistos.org/place/17132 Trismegistos, "Tacapae"]</ref> of the [[Roman province]] of [[Tripolitania]].

[[Strabo]] refers to this city as an important entrepot of the [[Lesser Syrtis]]. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (18.22) remarks that the waters of a copious fountain at Tacape were divided among the cultivators according to a system where each had the use of the water during a certain interval of time.

The {{Lang|la|[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]}} shows Tacape between [[Macomades]] and [[Sabratha]].

=== Bishopric ===
Tacapae became a Christian [[bishopric]] that, no longer being a residential see, is included in the [[Catholic Church]]'s list of [[titular see]]s.<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 980</ref>

Three of its bishops are known:<ref>Stefano Antonio Morcelli, [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_dO4-AAAAcAAJ/page/n318 <!-- pg=295 --> ''Africa christiana''], Volume I, Brescia 1816, p.&nbsp;295</ref>
*Dulcitius, [[Papal legate|legate]] of the bishops of Tripolitana to the [[Council of Carthage (403)]] and present at the [[Conference of Carthage (411)]]; 
*Servilius, exiled by [[Huneric]] in 484; 
*Caius or Gallus, legate of the bishops of his province to the [[Council of Carthage (525)]].

=== After the Roman and Christian period ===
[[File:Plan Gabes 1928.jpg|thumb|right|1928 map of Gabès under the French.]]
[[File:The Royal Air Force in Tunisia, May 1943 TR885.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Gabès in May 1943, shortly after being bombed in World War II.]]

*7th century: The [[Umayyad Caliphate]] conquest. [[Sahabah|Muhammed's companion]] Sidi Abu Lubaba Al'Ansari settles in Gabès.
*1148: The [[Zirids]] [[Zirid raid on Gabès|sack]] Gabés
*1574: Gabès becomes part of the [[Eyalet of Tunis]] after the Ottoman conquest.
*1881: Gabès comes under a French [[protectorate]].
*1940: Following the [[Fall of France]], Gabès comes under German control.
*1941: [[Gabès pogrom]]
*1943: Gabès [[Battle of the Mareth Line|returns to French control]] with the help of the British (in the [[Mareth Line]]). The operation results in serious damage to the city infrastructure. 
*1945: The rebuilding of Gabès starts.
*1956: Gabès reverts to [[Tunisia]]n control with the independence of Tunisia from the French.

== Education ==
* [[University of Gabès]] (science university, engineering school...)

== Economy ==
Gabès is one of the biggest industrial cities in [[Tunisia]]. Most industries are chemical oriented, this is why the city offers one of the best chemistry degrees in Africa from the [[University of Gabès]]. The main industries are:
* Cement
* Chemical products
* Brick Factories
* Oil refinery

The fast-growing numbers of factories has resulted in fairly serious pollution in the area and the [[Gulf of Gabès]].  In recent years the government has worked on new programs and laws to curb pollution.

== Transport ==
[[File:Façades de la gare de chemin de fer de Gabès.JPG|thumb|right|Gare of Gabès]]
[[Gabès – Matmata International Airport]] is in the city.

Gabès will soon be upgraded with one light rail system under the number 7 that will run from the railway station to the port of Gabès. Featuring rolling stock made by Alstom, Gabès will receive 15 new train sets.

===Railways===
Gabès is terminus of a narrow gauge {{RailGauge|1000mm}} branch railway from the capital, and is the nearest railway station to the [[Transport in Libya|Libyan]] border at [[Ras Ajdir]].
Gabès has also one of the biggest ports in Tunisia; it is used usually to ship the mineral products from the city of Gafsa.

====Roads====
Gabès will be linked soon with the national motorway A1 (Tunis – Ras Ajdir).

== Climate ==
Gabès has a [[desert climate#Hot desert climates|hot arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh''), bordering upon a [[semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid climate]] (''BSh''), characterised by hot summers and pleasant winters. Rainfall is low throughout the year and negligible during the hot summer.
