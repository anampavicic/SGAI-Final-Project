== History ==
=== Sultanate of Tidore ===
The '''Raja Ampat Islands''', located in Southwest Papua, have a long-standing history of having its own traditional government, governed by indigenous landowners known as ''Jaja'', and the ethnic Ma'ya kings known as ''Fun'' from Waigeo who migrated to the other islands. They were later influenced by the [[Sultanate of Bacan]] and the [[Sultanate of Tidore]], hence they adopted the Moluccan title of ''Kolano'', as part of the sultanate expansion under [[Gurabesi]]. The 'Four Kings' (called ''Kalana Fat'' in [[Ma'ya language|Ma'ya]] or ''Korano Ngaruha'' in [[Tidore language|Tidore]]<ref name="Wanggai 2008">{{cite thesis |last=Wanggai |first=Tony V.M. |date=2008 |title=Rekonstruksi Sejarah Islam di Tanah Papua |publisher=UIN Syarif Hidayatullah|url=https://repository.uinjkt.ac.id/dspace/bitstream/123456789/7292/1/Toni%20Victor%20M.%20Wanggai_Rekonstruksi%20Sejarah%20Umat%20Islam%20di%20Tanah%20Papua.pdf|access-date=2022-01-30|language=id}}</ref> or ''Raja Ampat'' in Indonesian) were appointed by the Tidore Sultan as administrators for the scattered group of islands and some coastal regions in Papua Island. These were three brothers: Fun Giwar, the ancestor of kings in [[Waigeo]]; Fun Malaban, the ancestor of kings in [[Salawati Kingdom|Salawati]]; Fun Bis, the ancestor of kings in Lilinta, west [[Misool]]. Later on, Tidore appointed another king, Tuimadahe, who was the ancestor of kings in [[Waigama]], east [[Misool]]. His descendants merged with the native Matbat ''Jaja'' line. Fun Mo, an unrelated [[Moi people|Moi]] from south of [[Sorong]], became ancestor of kings in [[Sailolof]], and later married the daughter of a king from Waigeo.<ref name="Mansoben1995pp242-246">{{cite book |last=Mansoben |first=Johszua Robert |author-link= |date=1995 |title=Sistem Politik Tradisional Di Irian Jaya |url= |location=Jakarta |publisher=LIPI - RUL 1995 |pages=242–246|isbn=979-8258-06-1}}</ref>

Tidore Sultanate became a Dutch protectorate in 17th century. At that time, Papua was considered to have little economic value compared to other islands, so the Tidore Sultanate was left to govern and tax it.<ref name="Swadling Wagner Laba p. 17">{{cite book |last1=Swadling |first1=Pamela |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/988941308 |title=Plumes from paradise: trade cycles in outer Southeast Asia and their impact on New Guinea and nearby islands until 1920 |last2=Wagner |first2=Roy |last3=Laba |first3=Billai |date=1 December 2019 |publisher=Sydney University Press |isbn=978-1-74332-544-5 |page=17 |doi=10.30722/sup.9781743325445 |oclc=988941308 |s2cid=240917675}}</ref> However, in the late 19th century, the Dutch Government realized that colonizing Papua could prevent other Europeans from approaching other islands in the [[Dutch East Indies]], which would have disrupted their trade monopoly, particularly in spices in the Maluku Islands.

Until the end of the 19th century, the main commodities in Papua were slaves and [[bird-of-paradise]] feathers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=THE DYNAMICS OF THE WESTERN NEW GUINEA (IRIAN BARAT) PROBLEM|url=https://www.papuaerfgoed.org/id/BK/1000/14|last=Bone|first=Robert|publisher=Cornell University|location=Ithaca, NY|year=1958}}</ref> In the early 20th century, mineral potential in Papua began to be discovered by Europeans.

[[File:Doom Island 1955.jpg|thumb|left|Doom Island in 1955]] 
At the beginning of the 20th century, the Dutch divided New Guinea into several parts called ''afdeeling''. One of these parts was ''Afdeeling Noord Nieuw Guinea'' (North New Guinea) based in [[Manokwari]]. Each ''afdeeling'' was further divided into several ''onderafdeeling'', one of which was the ''Sorong onderafdeeling'' centered on [[Doom Island]]. The Dutch then constructed offices, churches, and settlements on this island, making it a trading center and port. Residents who lived there at the time recount how Doom Island was brightly illuminated at night, even though the now major city of Sorong was still pitch black.<ref name="Kompas">{{Cite web|url=https://nasional.kompas.com/read/2008/08/04/21294133/Menelusuri.Kota.Tua.Ala.Belanda|title=Menelusuri Kota Tua Ala Belanda|date=4 August 2008|access-date=2022-11-19|website=kompas.com|last=Genthong|first=Aryo Wisanggeni}}</ref>

[[File:LandingAtSansapor.jpg|thumb|Allied troops landing in Sausapor, Tambrauw in July 1944]]
During [[World War II]], Papua was  [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|occupied by the Japanese]] in 1942 and became an area of intense fighting. The allied troops, led by General [[Douglas MacArthur]], implemented the "[[island hopping]]" strategy to disrupt the Japanese logistics chain. They gradually took control of the north coast of Papua, starting from [[Jayapura]], then [[Biak]], and moving to the next islands, until they reached [[Sausapor]] in Tambrauw Regency. The Allies sent spies to find a suitable place to land, and Sausapor beach was chosen. In [[Battle of Sansapor|Operation Globetrotter]], which took place between July and August 1944, the weakly defended Sausapor was captured by the allied forces. An airstrip was then built at Sausapor, which became the allied base for attacking the Moluccas and the Philippines. Japanese forces in Manokwari and Sorong, who were cut off from other units, fled to the forest and hid until the war was over. The Sausapor operation marked the liberation of Papua from Japan, and many remnants of the war can still be found in the area today.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sausapor Saksi Sejarah Perang Dunia II di Kabupaten Tambrauw Provinsi Papua Baral|url=https://pustaka.kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/index.php?p=show_detail&id=826|last1=Parera|first1=Ana, M.F.|publisher=Kepel Press|isbn=978-602-1228-12-8|location=Yogyakarta|last2=Usmany|first2=Desy|last3=Saberia|first3=Saberia|last4=Sinaga|first4=Rosmaida|year=2013}}</ref>

=== Post colonial ===
This region become the site of confrontations during [[Operation Trikora]] due to its proximity to Indonesian territory in the [[Maluku Islands]]. The first incursion into the Raja Ampat islands was an attempt by PG 200 on 14 September 1961 with 39 men under Lieutenant Jamaluddin Nasution. Lieutenant Nasution and two Papuans, Gerson Esuru (from Warwasi Village, Arguni) and Wos Rumaserang (both from the ''Gerakan Pelarian Pemuda'') died in this attempt. This was then followed by PG 300, with command company 191261 under Lieutenant Nana managing to infiltrate [[Gag Island]] and later joined by 29 local islanders. While command company 191260 under [[Non-commissioned officer|Serma]] Boy Thomas managed to reach Cape Dalpele in [[Waigeo Island]] after hiding in Bala-Bala Island. These efforts were followed by other infiltration of PG 400 (survivors of KRI Macan Tutul) led by Charles Papilaya and PG 500 (former [[Permesta]] rebels) led by Jonkey Robert Kumontoy and managed to join with Herlina Kasim and also PG 200 who had arrived earlier. The island of Waigeo was a safe haven for Indonesian troops as Dutch forces rarely patrolled the region.<ref name="Kemdikbud 1983 p.81">{{Cite web |last1=Patiara |first1=John |last2=Renwarin |first2=Herman |last3=Soedharto |first3=Bondan |last4=Palangan |first4=M. |date=1983 |title=Sejarah Perlawanan Terhadap Imperialis dan Kolonialisme di Daerah Irian Jaya |url=http://repositori.kemdikbud.go.id/14100/1/Sejarah%20perlawanan%20terhadap%20imperialisme%20dan%20kolonialisme%20di%20daerah%20irian%20jaya.PDF |access-date=18 January 2023 |website=Kemdikbud |pages=81}}</ref><ref name="25 Tahun Trikora 1998 pp.96-109">{{cite book | title=25 tahun Trikora | via=Google Play Books | year=1988 | url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=650vAAAAMAAJ&pg=GBS.PR2&hl=en | language=id |pages=96–109 | publisher=Yayasan Badan Kontak Keluarga Besar Perintis Irian Barat | access-date=2021-11-01}}</ref><ref name="Kemdikbud 1983 p.91-99">{{Cite web|last1=Patiara|first1=John|last2=Renwarin|first2=Herman|last3=Soedharto|first3=Bondan|last4=Palangan|first4=M.|date=1983|title=Sejarah Perlawanan Terhadap Imperialis dan Kolonialisme di Daerah Irian Jaya|url=http://repositori.kemdikbud.go.id/14100/1/Sejarah%20perlawanan%20terhadap%20imperialisme%20dan%20kolonialisme%20di%20daerah%20irian%20jaya.PDF|website=Kemdikbud|pages=91–99| access-date=3 November 2021}}</ref> While in Sorong, Simon Randa, a [[Torajan people|Torajan]], with the Moi tribes supplied Indonesian guerilla forces called ''enso-enso'' {{lit|red-white}} in the [[Moi language]].<ref name="25 Tahun Trikora 1988 pp.164-167">{{cite book | title=25 tahun Trikora | via=Google Play Books | year=1988 | publisher=Yayasan Badan Kontak Keluarga Besar Perintis Irian Barat | url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=650vAAAAMAAJ&pg=GBS.PR2&hl=en | language=rw | pages=164–167| access-date=2021-11-01}}</ref>

The [[Western New Guinea Dispute|dispute of Western New Guinea]] was resolved with the signing of the [[New York Agreement]], putting the region under the [[United Nations Temporary Executive Authority]] (UNTEA) until it was transferred to Indonesian control in 1963. In 1969, the [[Act of Free Choice]] or PEPERA {{lit|Determination of the People's Opinion}} was held, which controversially formalized West Irian as Indonesian territory. The government subsequently restructured the administrative divisions of the region, changing the former Sorong onderafdeeling to Sorong Regency, which now covers an area similar to that of the present Southwest Papua Province.<ref>UU Nomor 12 Tahun 1969</ref> The small island of Doom was abandoned, while the city of Sorong on the mainland of Papua Island has grown increasingly crowded and densely populated due to its strategic location. Doom Island is now the capital of Sorong Islands district, and some of the old buildings have been restored to serve as government offices. The population of Sorong has also increased with the government's [[transmigration program]].<ref name="Kompas"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kependudukan.brin.go.id/kajian-kependudukan/migrasi-penduduk-ke-kota-sorong/|title=Migrasi Penduduk ke Kota Sorong|last=Inayah|first=Hidayati|publisher=BRIN – LIPI|year=2018}}</ref> Because of Sorong's rapid growth, the local government proposed an increase in the status of Sorong to become an Administrative City which was approved by the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Indonesia)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] in 1996.

On 4 October 1999, [[Sorong|Sorong City]] was formalized by law and separated from Sorong Regency.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sorongkota.go.id/sejarah-singkat/|title=Sejarah Singkat|website=sorongkota.go.id|publisher=Pemerintah Kota Sorong}}</ref> The existence of regional autonomy has caused rapid expansion in the number of regencies and districts. Sorong Regency has become smaller in size due to this regional division. On 11 December 2002 South Sorong Regency and Raja Ampat Regency were created from parts of Sorong Regency, then in 2008 Tambrauw Regency (on 29 October) and Maybrat Regency (on 19 December) were created from other parts of Sorong Regency. The support for the creation of a new province was due to dispute on the location of [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]]'s provincial capital between Sorong and Manokwari. Manokwari faction argues that Manokwari is a ''mnukwar'' (old village), because it was the location of the original Dutch residents. After the decision to pick Manokwari, [[John Piet Wanane]], the Regent of Sorong, began to coordinate efforts to create a new province for the former Sorong Regency, called ''Sorong Raya'', which is based according to the ethnic groups that exist in the region.<ref name="Suryawan">{{cite journal | last=Suryawan | first=I.

The expansion in the aforementioned area was plagued by numerous controversies. In [[Maybrat Regency]], a debate erupted over the location of the district capital between Kumurkek and Ayamaru. The people of Aifat supported Kumurkek, while the people of Ayamaru and Aitinyo supported Ayamaru. This tussle over the capital continued until the [[Constitutional Court of Indonesia|Constitutional Court]] intervened in 2013 and declared Ayamaru as the official capital. Despite this decision, community divisions persisted, and a meeting was eventually organized between the conflicting parties. In 2019, it was finally agreed that the capital would be relocated to Kumurkek. However, following the transfer, the Ayamaru people expressed their intention to establish the Maybrat Sau Regency and split from the original Maybrat Regency.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://monitorpapua.com/ada-waktu-ayamaru-aitinyo-aifat-a3-adakan-rekonsiliasi/|title=Ada Waktu Ayamaru, Aitinyo, Aifat (A3) Adakan Rekonsiliasi|date=10 March 2018|access-date=2022-11-19|website=monitorpapua.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Cahyu |first= |date=27 September 2018 |title=Ibu Kota Maybrat Berpindah dari Ayamaru ke Kumurkek |work=Liputan6 |url=https://www.liputan6.com/news/read/3653490/ibu-kota-maybrat-berpindah-dari-ayamaru-ke-kumurkek |access-date=2022-11-19}}</ref> Tambrauw Regency was also embroiled in controversy when it "borrowed" four districts from Manokwari Regency, with the political motive of facilitating local elections. The move was met with protests from the community, but the Constitutional Court rejected the appeal and upheld the decision in 2013. The residents of Kebar, Amberbaken, Mubrani, and Senopi, who felt that they had been forcibly transferred to Tambrauw, announce a new region called West Manokwari Regency. With the creation of Southwest Papua, the community requested that West Manokwari be removed from the new province since it is geographically and culturally closer to Manokwari than Sorong and is the customary territory of the Arfak tribe. However, this issue was not addressed until the new province was formed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jagatpapua.com/disepakati-11-distrik-pemekaran-dari-4-distrik-di-tambrauw-dikembalikan-ke-manokwari/|title=Disepakati 11 Distrik Pemekaran dari 4 Distrik Di Tambrauw Dikembalikan Ke Manokwari|date=8 September 2022|access-date=2022-11-19|website=jagatpapua.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Akbar |first=Nawir Arsyad |date=31 August 2022 |editor-last=Raharjo |editor-first=Agus |title=RUU Papua Barat Daya Ungkap Praktik Pinjam Distrik untuk Pilkada |url=https://www.republika.co.id/berita/rhggg0436/ruu-papua-barat-daya-ungkap-praktik-pinjam-distrik-untuk-pilkada |website=republika.co.id}}</ref>

Southwest Papua was passed into law on 17 November 2022 by the DPR and inaugurated on 9 December 2022 by the Ministry of Home Affairs. On the day of the inauguration, [[Muhammad Musa'ad]] was also appointed as acting governor. Article from Antara News reports that the Sorong Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Southwest Papua is expected to play a vital role in empowering a large number of workers for the sake of boosting regional development.

[[File:View of the western most bay aken from top of Mount Pindito, Bird's Head Seascape - Wayag Islands.jpg|thumb|Wayag Islands in Raja Ampat]]
Southwest Papua, situated in the western expanse of the [[Bird's Head Peninsula]], encompasses diverse topographies ranging from coastal regions to mountainous terrain. Along the southern coast of Sorong and South Sorong Regency, mangrove ecosystems thrive, contributing significantly to the region's biodiversity and ecological resilience. The coastal stretch of South Sorong, in particular, is renowned for hosting one of the largest [[mangrove]] and [[sago]] forest expanses on Papua Island. Within this rich ecosystem, a plethora of flora and fauna flourish, serving as vital sources of sustenance for local tribes and offering lucrative export commodities. Noteworthy among these are sago palms, mangrove crabs, and shrimp, which contribute to the region's economic vitality and cultural heritage.

On 25 October 2013 the [[People's Representative Council]] began reviewing draft laws on the establishment of 57 prospective regencies/cities (and 8 new provinces).<ref>Jakarta Post, 14 November 2013</ref> This included a new province of '''Southwest Papua''' to be created out of the existing West Papua province, together with five new regencies to be formed within the new Southwest Papua Province – Malamoi and Maybrat Sau (both taken from Sorong Regency), Imekko (from South Sorong Regency), North Raja Ampat and South Raja Ampat (both from Raja Ampat Regency). Except for the creation of the new province of Southwest Papua, these projected changes have not yet (by 2024) been implemented.

The province now forms one of Indonesia's 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the [[Indonesian Parliament|People's Representative Council]].

== Economy ==
[[File:KEK Sorong.jpg|thumb|Sorong Special Economic Zone]]
Sorong, situated in Southwest Papua, holds immense promise owing to its strategic positioning along the trade routes connecting the [[Asia-Pacific]] and [[Australia]]. Recognizing its potential, the central government took initiative in 2016 by establishing the Sorong [[Special Economic Zone]] (SEZ), encompassing an expansive area of 523.7 hectares. The vision for the Sorong SEZ was ambitious, aiming to catalyze economic development across Papua by fostering a diverse array of industries. These included [[nickel]] mining, [[palm oil]] production, and the processing of other forestry products, leveraging the region's rich natural resources. However, despite initial enthusiasm and governmental support, the Sorong SEZ has encountered challenges. Chief among them is the tepid response from potential investors, which has cast doubt on the project's viability. Consequently, there are concerns that the SEZ status of Sorong may be at risk of being revoked due to the lack of investor interest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://regional.kompas.com/read/2023/05/09/190003678/kek-sorong-tak-optimal-tarik-investor-ini-langkah-pemprov-papua-barat-daya|title=KEK Sorong Tak Optimal Tarik Investor, Ini Langkah Pemprov Papua Barat Daya|date=2023-05-09|website=kompas.com|last=Maichel|access-date=2023-05-16|archive-date=2023-05-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230525003602/https://regional.kompas.com/read/2023/05/09/190003678/kek-sorong-tak-optimal-tarik-investor-ini-langkah-pemprov-papua-barat-daya}}</ref>

=== Mining ===
Southwest Papua emerges as a hub of significant mining potential, particularly in the domains of [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], and nickel. Notably, the state-owned corporation [[Pertamina]] EP Cepu undertakes oil and gas drilling operations across various locales within Sorong Regency, including Salawati, Sele Linda, and Klamono. In a concerted effort to capitalize on these resources, Pertamina, via its subsidiary PT Kilang Pertamina Internasional Unit VII Kasim, has established an [[oil refinery]]. This refinery serves to process oil extracted from Salawati and Sele Linda, contributing to the region's energy infrastructure and economic growth. Additionally, Petrogas (Basin) Ltd., a Singapore-based company, operates within Southwest Papua, with facilities located in Kasim and Arar. Petrogas engages in crude oil extraction from fields such as Walio and Matoa, channeling the extracted resources to Pertamina's refinery in Kasim. Furthermore, the facility in Arar plays a pivotal role in gas production, serving as a fuel source for the power plant situated in Sorong.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ekonomi.republika.co.id/berita/rgudhm457/gag-nikel-berencana-tambah-kapasitas-produksi-jadi-4-juta-wmt|title=Gag Nikel Berencana Tambah Kapasitas Produksi Jadi 4 Juta Wmt|date=2022-08-19|access-date=2023-05-16|website=republika.co.id|last=Pratiwi|first=Fuji|publisher=Republika|archive-date=2023-05-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230516165134/https://ekonomi.republika.co.id/berita/rgudhm457/gag-nikel-berencana-tambah-kapasitas-produksi-jadi-4-juta-wmt}}</ref>

Sorong Regency has tens of thousands of hectares of [[palm oil]] plantations managed by four companies in Salawati, Klamono and Segun. However, the land was returned to the Moi tribal community due to licensing violations so the company's permit was revoked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnnindonesia.com/nasional/20220112193236-12-745852/ptun-tolak-perusahaan-sawit-sorong-tanah-kembali-ke-masyarakat-adat|title=PTUN Tolak Perusahaan Sawit Sorong, Tanah Kembali ke Masyarakat Adat|date=2022-01-12|access-date=2023-05-16|publisher=CNN Indonesia|archive-date=2023-05-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230516151953/https://www.cnnindonesia.com/nasional/20220112193236-12-745852/ptun-tolak-perusahaan-sawit-sorong-tanah-kembali-ke-masyarakat-adat}}</ref>

South Sorong Regency boasts significant [[sago]] potential, offering a valuable resource for both traditional culinary practices and industrial-scale production. Sago flour, derived from processed sago, holds promise as a commodity of industrial significance. One prominent player in this sector is PT Austindo Nusantara Jaya Agri Papua (ANJAP), a sizable company with a sago forest concession spanning approximately 40 thousand hectares in Matemani District. Notably, 10 thousand hectares within this concession are designated as conservation areas. PT ANJAP, a subsidiary of PT ANJ engaged in the palm oil industry, operates in a manner distinct from oil palm plantations. Rather than extensively altering the landscape, PT ANJAP focuses on harnessing naturally occurring sago from swamps and wet peatlands.  Furthermore, Perhutani, a state-owned forestry enterprise, has also invested in sago production, establishing a sago factory in Kais District. This initiative is supported by a sago forest concession covering an area of 16 thousand hectares. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anj-group.com/en/news-events/index/pj-gubernur-papua-barat-daya-kunjungi-anjap-dorong-pengembangan-sagu-untuk-menjadi-prioritas-daerah|title=PJ GUBERNUR PAPUA BARAT DAYA KUNJUNGI ANJAP, DORONG PENGEMBANGAN SAGU UNTUK MENJADI PRIORITAS DAERAH|date=2024-01-25|website=anj-group.com|publisher=ANJ Group}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://perpustakaan.menlhk.go.id/pustaka/home/index.php?page=detail_news&newsid=551|title=PENGELOLAAN HUTAN BERKELANJUTAN : SAGU PAPUA, SUMBER PANGAN BERKELANJUTAN|access-date=2024-02-14|website=perpustakaan.menlhk.go.id|publisher=Kementerian Lingkungan Hidup dan Kehutanan|year=2018}}</ref>

The Raja Ampat Islands are a series of four adjacent island clusters located in the western part of the Bird's Head (Vogelkoop) of Papua Island. Administratively, this cluster is mainly under Raja Ampat Regency, Southwest Papua Province (except for two districts which lie within the [[Sorong Regency]]). These islands are now a destination for divers who are interested in the underwater scenery. The island group is named after the four kings, who used to rule the islands of [[Waigeo Island|Waigeo]], [[Misool Island|Misool]], [[Salawati Island|Salawati]], and [[Batanta Island|Batanta]].<ref name=":0" />

=== Cultural festivals ===
[[File:Penabuh Suling Tambur.jpg|thumb|Suling Tambur performance]]
Suling tambur is a traditional dance art practiced by the people of Raja Ampat. Central to this performance are two distinct musical instruments: the flute, ''[[suling]]'', and the large [[tifa (drum)|tifa]], ''tambur''. Traditionally, these dances were reserved for special occasions such as weddings and traditional festivities, where groups of performers would come together to entertain and celebrate. The drum, originally crafted from skins of stingray, [[Pigeye shark|magewang]], or other shark species, has evolved over time, with modern iterations now utilizing goat or deer skin. Similarly, the flute, an integral component of the ensemble, is traditionally fashioned from bamboo, lending its unique timbre to the musical accompaniment. In recent years, the ''suling tambur'' has become a symbol of festivity and cultural pride, extending its presence to larger events beyond traditional gatherings. The Raja Ampat Regency Government has taken proactive steps to preserve and promote this cherished cultural heritage by organizing the Suling Tambur Festival annually since 2017.<ref name="tambur">{{cite web | title=Suling Tambur, Warisan Kebudayaan Masyarakat Raja Ampat | website=InfoPublik | date=2021-11-13 | url=https://infopublik.id/kategori/nusantara/581156/suling-tambur-warisan-kebudayaan-masyarakat-raja-ampat | language=id | access-date=2024-05-17}}</ref>
