The state of Santa Catarina is one of the oldest states in Brazil. It separated from São Paulo in 1738, with [[José da Silva Pais]] serving as its first governor.

== Etymology ==
{{See also|Catherine of Alexandria}}
Francisco Dias Velho, who arrived on the [[Santa Catarina Island|island now known as Santa Catarina]] around 1675, is said to have given the place its name. There, he built a chapel dedicated to [[Catherine of Alexandria]], whom, it is claimed, one of his daughters was named after.<ref name=":4">{{Harvnb|Houaiss|Malheiros|Barbosa|Andrade|1993|p=10187}}.</ref><ref name=":5">{{Cite web |last=Girardi |first=Giovana |date= |title=Índios, santos e geografia |url=http://revistagalileu.globo.com/Galileu/0,6993,ECT498531-1716-6,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031093809/http://revistagalileu.globo.com/Galileu/0,6993,ECT498531-1716-6,00.html |archive-date=31 October 2013 |access-date=28 September 2013 |publisher=Revista Galileu |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other authors attribute the origin of the name to [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]], who is said to have dedicated the island. At that time, the renowned Venetian explorer and cartographer passed through the area between 1526 and 1527. He is thought to have consecrated it to [[List of saints named Catherine|Saint Catherine]], or rather, honoured his wife, Catarina Medrano.<ref name=":5" /> The name of the state is derived from that of the island.<ref name=":4" />

Originating from [[Catholicism]], the name honours the state's patron saint.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":5" /> The [[Roman people|Romans]] worshipped an ancient deity, [[Sancus]], who ensured promises and oaths were not violated, mandating their fulfilment. From his name comes the Latin verb sancire, "to consecrate". Sanctus, "holy, consecrated, which must, above all, be treated with respect", is the past participle of the verb itself.

At the outset of the [[16th century]], the area now known as the state of Santa Catarina was populated by the Carijós, a tribe belonging to the [[Tupi–Guarani languages|Tupi-Guarani group]]. These Indigenous peoples were catechised (educated and pacified in the Catholic faith) starting from 1549.<ref>{{Harvnb|Arruda|1988|p=7135}}.</ref>

Expeditions from [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] commenced exploration of the Santa Catarina coast in the early years following Brazil's discovery by Europeans.<ref name=":8">{{Harvnb|Mascarenhas|Biasi|Coltrinari|Moraes|1998|pp=5224–5225}}.</ref> [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]], en route to the [[Río de la Plata|Rio de la Plata]], navigated past the [[Santa Catarina Island|island then known as Dos Patos]], bestowing upon it the name Santa Catarina in 1526. In 1534, John III of Portugal awarded the mainland territories to [[Pedro Lopes de Sousa]]. Nevertheless, these lands remained largely uninhabited, with [[Jesuits]], Spanish, and Portuguese settlers exploring them but failing to establish any permanent settlements throughout the 16th century.<ref name=":8" />

From the outset of Brazil's colonisation, the lands of Brazil's [[South Region, Brazil|southern region]] did not greatly interest the Portuguese colonisers. This was due to the absence of [[Precious metal|precious metals]] and its colder climate (as [[Frost|frosts]] hindered the cultivation of [[sugarcane]]). The Portuguese only began to take an interest in the region in the mid-[[17th century]]. The settlement of [[São Francisco do Sul|Nossa Senhora da Graça do Rio de São Francisco]] was established by Manuel Lourenço de Andrade and his friends in 1658. The present-day city was the first permanent settlement in the region.<ref name=":8" />

The settlement of [[Florianópolis|Nossa Senhora do Desterro]], on the island of Santa Catarina, was established by the Paulista [[Bandeirantes|bandeirante]] Francisco Dias Velho in 1675. At that time, the notable settler was accompanied by his heirs, slaves, and servants. In 1676, the settlement of [[Laguna, Santa Catarina|Laguna]] was initiated by Domingos de Brito Peixoto. The Captaincy of Santa Catarina, initially linked to [[Captaincy of São Paulo|São Paulo]], was founded in 1738. It was separated from São Paulo and incorporated into [[Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro's]] in 1739.<ref name=":8" />

From the 1740s onwards, initiated by [[Alexandre de Gusmão]], minister of King [[John V of Portugal|John V]], Portugal began a colonisation and settlement project in southern Brazil, aiming to secure possession of the territory disputed by the Spanish. With this objective, immigration from [[Madeira Island]] and the [[Azores]] was sought. An insular defensive system was implemented. From 1748 to 1756, around five thousand Azorean immigrants began to populate the island and the coastline of the captaincy. Disputes between Portugal and Spain led to the occupation and destruction of the island of Santa Catarina by Spanish troops in 1777. The [[First Treaty of San Ildefonso]] forced the Spanish to surrender the invaded region.<ref name=":8" />

The Captaincy of Our Lady of the Rosary of Paranaguá was founded by the Marquis of Cascais in 1656.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wachowicz|1995|p=42}}.</ref> It replaced the Captaincy of Santana,<ref name=":9">{{Harvnb|Wons|1994|p=107}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Wachowicz|1995|p=111}}.</ref> which began at the mouth of the Paranaguá Bay and ended in the current city of [[Laguna, Santa Catarina|Laguna]].<ref name=":9" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Wachowicz|1995|p=39}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Bueno|1999|p=86}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Cintra|2013|p=27}}.</ref> It is bounded by the Captaincy of Santo Amaro (part of the second section of [[Captaincy of São Vicente|São Vicente]]) to the north,<ref name=":9" /> the salty waters of the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the [[Governorate of New Andalusia]] to the west.<ref name=":10">{{Cite web |title=Sistema de Capitanias Hereditárias do Brasil |url=http://www.estudopratico.com.br/sistema-de-capitanias-hereditarias-do-brasil/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003173123/http://www.estudopratico.com.br/sistema-de-capitanias-hereditarias-do-brasil/ |archive-date=3 October 2016 |access-date=12 February 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Mingo |first=Milagros del Vas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CboLAAAAYAAJ&q=Las+Capitulaciones+de+Indias+en+el+siglo+XVI |title=Las capitulaciones de Indias en el siglo XVI |date=1986 |publisher=Ediciones Cultura Hispánica, Instituto de Cooperación Iberoamericana |isbn=978-84-7232-397-1 |language=es}}</ref> These extinct states were delimited by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]].<ref name=":10" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Tratado de Tordesilhas - História, mapa e Brasil |url=http://www.estudopratico.com.br/tratado-de-tordesilhas-historia-mapa-e-brasil/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114033638/http://www.estudopratico.com.br/tratado-de-tordesilhas-historia-mapa-e-brasil/ |archive-date=14 January 2016 |access-date=12 February 2016 |website=Estudo Prático |url-status=live }}</ref>

The captaincy was elevated to the status of a province with the declaration of [[independence of Brazil]]. The province of Santa Catarina suffered profound consequences from the [[Ragamuffin War]], which took place in [[Rio Grande do Sul]] in 1835. The revolutionaries, led by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] and [[David Canabarro]], invaded Laguna and declared the [[Juliana Republic]] in July 1839. Defeated by the troops of the [[Empire of Brazil]], the rebels left Laguna.<ref name=":8" /> The new South American country had a short duration because, when its independence was proclaimed, it stopped paying the [[Riograndense Republic]] due to lack of resources.<ref name=":26">{{Cite book |last=Cabral |first=Oswaldo R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwosAAAAYAAJ&q=Hist%C3%B3ria+de+Santa+Catarina |title=História de Santa Catarina |date=1970 |publisher=Editôra Laudes |language=pt-BR}}</ref> The last Ragamuffin trenches were demolished in 1840. European colonisation, especially from [[Germany]] and [[Italy]], was boosted in the second half of the 19th century. The colonies of Dona Francisca, later [[Joinville]], were established in 1850; [[Blumenau]] in 1852; and [[Brusque, Santa Catarina|Brusque]] in 1860.<ref name=":8" />

The province adhered to the [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|proclamation of the Republic]]. However, the appointed governor rebelled against the federal government of the time, supporting the [[Federalist Revolution]] in 1893. Desterro became the [[naval base]] of the revolutionary squadron led by [[Custódio José de Melo]].<ref name=":8" />

The armed conflicts spread throughout the coast of Santa Catarina. Defeated in 1894, the revolutionaries were severely punished by the loyalist troops. [[Hercílio Luz]] was elected governor in 1894 and developed a policy for the pacification of the region and the repair of the infrastructural problems that the state had suffered. Desterro was renamed Florianópolis, in honour of [[Floriano Peixoto]], following a turn of events that cost the lives of the defenders of the revolution.<ref name=":8" />

The [[Contestado War]] began in 1912.

During the [[Second World War]], it was necessary to address the issue of [[Nazism|Nazi]] infiltration in the state. In this area, the Brazilian military effort was not compromised by groups of Germans, following a futile attempt. Up until 1945, intervenors governed the state throughout President [[Getúlio Vargas]]'s administration. Since the 1950s, encouragement for the colonisation of the far west and the centre of the state by [[Italian Brazilians|Italian-Brazilian settlers]] has contributed to the progress of Santa Catarina. These settlers came from Rio Grande do Sul.<ref name=":8" />

== Geography ==
[[File:Brazil Santa Catarina relief map.png|thumb|350x350px|Topographic map of Santa Catarina]]
Santa Catarina is one of the three states in the [[South Region, Brazil|Southern Region]] of Brazil. It is bordered to the north by the state of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], to the south by the state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], to the east by the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and to the west by the [[Provinces of Argentina|Argentine province]] of [[Misiones Province|Misiones]].<ref name=":0" /> The state covers an area of approximately {{convert|95730.69|km2|-2}}, comparable to [[Hungary]], and ranking as the [[List of Brazilian states by area|seventh smallest Brazilian state by area]].<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":0" /><ref name="Santa Catarina IBGE" /> 

Its territory is entirely below the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], in the [[Temperate climate|southern temperate zone]] of the planet. It follows the [[UTC−03:00]] time zone ([[Brasília time]]), three hours behind [[Greenwich Mean Time]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2011-07-22 |title=Fusos Brasil sem HV |url=http://pcdsh01.on.br/fusbr.htm |access-date=2024-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722173247/http://pcdsh01.on.br/fusbr.htm |archive-date=22 July 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Its extreme points are: to the north, the Saí-Guaçu river in the municipality of [[Itapoá]]; to the south, the [[Mampituba River|Mampituba river]] in [[Praia Grande, Santa Catarina|Praia Grande]]; to the east, the Ponta dos Ingleses in [[Florianópolis]]; to the west, the confluence of the [[Uruguay River|Uruguay]] and [[Pepiri-Guazu River|Pepiri-Guazu]] rivers in [[Itapiranga, Santa Catarina|Itapiranga]], on the border with [[Argentina]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=SC - Caracterização do Território |url=https://www.angelfire.com/al/Geografia/sc.html |access-date=2024-02-15 |website=[[Angelfire]]}}</ref>

=== Relief ===

Santa Catarina has 77% of its territory above 300 metres and 52% above 600 metres, making it one of the [[List of Brazilian states by highest point|Brazilian federative units with the highest relief]]. Four geomorphological units, ranging from the coast to the interior, form the state's relief: the coastal lowland, the Serra do Mar, the [[Paleozoic|Palaeozoic]] plateau, and the [[Basalt|Basaltic]] plateau.<ref name=":11" /> The lowest altitudes are found in the coastal lowland, which encompasses lands located below 200 metres. In the northern part, it is quite wide, extending far inland through the valleys of the rivers that flow from the Serra do Mar. Meanwhile, towards the south, it gradually narrows.<ref name=":11" />

The Serra do Mar occupies the coastal lowland in the western part. In the north of the state, it forms the mountainous edge of a reasonably average plateau. It has a very different feature from what is found in other states such as [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] and [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]]. In Santa Catarina, it constitutes a range of mountains, with points above one thousand metres. This range is formed by a group of massifs isolated by the deep valleys of the rivers that descend to the Atlantic Ocean. Behind the [[Serra do Mar]], the Palaeozoic plateau extends. Its flattened area is divided into spaces separated by rivers, which flow eastward. The Palaeozoic plateau decreases in altitude from north to south. In the southern portion of the state, it merges with the coastal plain, since the Serra do Mar does not extend to this region of Santa Catarina.<ref name=":11" />

The Basaltic plateau encompasses a significant portion of the state's territory. Comprising [[Basalt|basaltic]] sediments (lava flows), interspersed with [[sandstone]] deposits, its eastern boundary is a mountainous edge known as the [[Serra Geral]]. In the north of the state, the edge of the basaltic plateau is situated inland. Moving southwards, it progressively approaches the coast until, at the border with Rio Grande do Sul, it starts to descend directly towards the sea. The plateau area is reasonably average and slopes gently westward. The rivers, flowing towards the neighbouring state of Paraná, have carved deep valleys into it.<ref name=":11" /> The lands of the mixed ombrophilous forest are infertile, as are the soils of the [[Grassland|grasslands]], which are utilised for dairy and beef cattle farming. The soils of the [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|humid subtropical forest]] are characterised by their fertility.<ref>{{Harvnb|Arruda|1988|p=7133}}.</ref>

=== Climate ===
[[File:Santa Catarina Köppen.svg|thumb|250x250px|Köppen types of Santa Catarina]]
According to the [[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system]], Santa Catarina predominantly features a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') in the coastal lowlands and the lower altitude areas of the plateau, whilst the remainder of the plateau is characterised by a [[oceanic climate|subtropical oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'').<ref name=":12" /> Both have the four seasons well-defined and a rainfall regime evenly distributed throughout the year.<ref name=":12" />

The humid subtropical climate ''(Cfa)'' records average temperatures of 20 °C in the lowlands and the Uruguay Valley, and 18 °C in the western extremity of the state. Conversely, the temperate subtropical climate (''Cfb'') sees average temperatures ranging between 16 and 18 °C. There is a significant difference between summer and winter temperatures, leading to a considerable [[Atmospheric temperature|thermal amplitude]] throughout the year. Winters vary from cool to cold, with some regions experiencing about 25 days of [[frost]] annually.<ref name=":12" /> During this period, the incursion of [[Air mass|polar air masses]] is more common, some being stronger and more extensive, causing temperatures to fall below zero in various cities.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sexta-feira amanheceu com temperatura negativa em várias regiões de Santa Catarina |url=https://www.diariodajaragua.com.br/geral/sexta-feira-amanheceu-com-temperatura-negativa-em-varias-regioes-de/459860/ |access-date=2024-02-15 |website=www.diariodajaragua.com.br |language=pt-br}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Frio em SC: Estado registra 40 cidades com temperaturas negativas |url=https://www.nsctotal.com.br/noticias/sc-registra-40-cidades-com-temperaturas-negativas |access-date=2024-02-15 |website=NSC Total |language=pt-BR}}</ref> The majority of these cities are located in the Midwest, North Plateau, and South Plateau.<ref name=":13">{{Cite web |date=2020-11-24 |title=Recordes de Frio – EPAGRI/CIRAM |url=https://ciram.epagri.sc.gov.br/index.php/recordes-de-frio/ |access-date=2024-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124173816/https://ciram.epagri.sc.gov.br/index.php/recordes-de-frio/ |archive-date=24 November 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> Notably, [[Bom Jardim da Serra]], [[São Joaquim]], [[Urubici]], and [[Urupema]], situated on the South Plateau, rank among the coldest municipalities in the country.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cidades mais frias do Brasil |url=https://www.terra.com.br/noticias/infograficos/cidades-mais-frias-do-brasil/ |access-date=2024-02-15 |website=Terra |language=pt-BR}}</ref>

A large part of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] is situated at latitudes lower than Santa Catarina. Despite this, it is in the higher areas of the Santa Catarina southern plateau where there is a higher occurrence of [[Snow in Brazil|snowfall in Brazil]] during the winter months.<ref name=":12" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Onde já nevou no Brasil? |url=https://super.abril.com.br/mundo-estranho/onde-ja-nevou-no-brasil/ |access-date=2024-02-15 |website=Super |language=pt-BR}}</ref> The state also holds the record for the lowest temperature recorded in Brazilian territory by official bodies. The temperature reached −14 °C in [[Caçador]] on 11 June 1952. On the other hand, the highest temperature reached 44.6 °C in Orleans on 6 January 1963. The hottest localities in the state are located in the regions of the southern coast, Itajaí Valley, and extreme west. This is because here lies the city considered the hottest in Santa Catarina, [[Itapiranga, Santa Catarina|Itapiranga]]. In these regions, temperatures can exceed 40 °C in the summer or on other extreme occasions.<ref name=":13" />

=== Hydrography ===
The rivers that flow through the state's territory are part of both autonomous systems delineated by the [[Serra Geral]] and [[Serra do Mar]] mountain ranges. The South Atlantic basin is made up of inter-delimited basins, such as those of the [[Itajaí-Açu river|Itajaí-Açu]], [[Tubarão River|Tubarão]], [[Araranguá River|Araranguá]], [[Tijucas River|Tijucas]], and [[Itapocu River|Itapocu]] rivers.<ref name=":12" /> In the interior of the state, two basins come together to form the [[Río de la Plata Basin|Plata basin]]: that of the [[Paraná River|Paraná]], whose most important tributary is the [[Iguazu River]], and that of the [[Uruguay River]]. The latter has as its main tributaries the [[Pelotas River|Pelotas]], [[Canoas River (Santa Catarina)|Canoas]], [[Chapecó River|Chapecó]], and [[Do Peixe River (Santa Catarina)|Do Peixe]] rivers.<ref name=":12" />

=== Fauna and flora ===
[[File:Itaimbezinho - Parque Nacional Aparados da Serra 32.JPG|thumb|''Araucaria'' forest]]
Fully embedded within the [[Atlantic Forest]] biome, the original vegetation of Santa Catarina encompasses two formations: [[Forest|forests]] and [[Grassland|grasslands]].<ref name=":12" />

On the plateau, they occur in the form of mixed [[coniferous]] (''[[Araucaria]]'') forests with broadleaved trees and, in the lowland and foothills of the Serra do Mar, solely as broadleaved forest. The grasslands appear as scattered patches within the mixed forest. The main ones are those of São Joaquim, [[Lages]], [[Curitibanos]], and [[Campos Novos]].<ref name=":12" />

In the fauna of Santa Catarina, about 600 species of birds,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Aves de Santa Catarina |url=http://avesdesantacatarina.com.br/ |access-date=2024-02-15 |website=avesdesantacatarina.com.br |language=pt-br}}</ref> 150 mammals,<ref>{{Cite journal |date=2015-06-21 |title=Mastozoología neotropical - Lista dos mamíferos do Estado de Santa Catarina, Sul Do Brasil |journal=Mastozoología Neotropical |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=151–184 |url=http://www.scielo.org.ar/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0327-93832004000200002 |access-date=2024-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621060430/http://www.scielo.org.ar/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0327-93832004000200002 |archive-date=21 June 2015 |last1=Cherem |first1=Jorge J. |last2=Simões-Lopes |first2=Paulo C. |last3=Althoff |first3=Sérgio |last4=Graipel |first4=Maurício E. |url-status=live }}</ref> and 140 systematic denominations of amphibians are catalogued.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=2015-06-21 |title=Mastozoología neotropical - Lista dos mamíferos do Estado de Santa Catarina, Sul Do Brasil |journal=Mastozoología Neotropical |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=151–184 |url=http://www.scielo.org.ar/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0327-93832004000200002 |access-date=2024-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621060430/http://www.scielo.org.ar/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0327-93832004000200002 |archive-date=21 June 2015 |last1=Cherem |first1=Jorge J. |last2=Simões-Lopes |first2=Paulo C. |last3=Althoff |first3=Sérgio |last4=Graipel |first4=Maurício E. |url-status=live }}</ref> There are 1,150 ''[[Lepidoptera]]'' (butterflies and moths), in addition to the registration of about 2,300 [[Vascular plant|vascular plants]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Piovesan |first1=Monica |last2=Orlandin |first2=Elton |last3=Favretto |first3=Mario Arthur |last4=Santos |first4=Emili Bortolon |date=2014-09-28 |title=Contribuição para o conhecimento da lepidopterofauna de Santa Catarina |url=https://www.scientiaplena.org.br/sp/article/view/1945 |journal=Scientia Plena |language=pt |volume=10 |issue=9 |issn=1808-2793}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Inventário florístico florestal de Santa Catarina.

==Flag==
The flag of Santa Catarina is a [[rectangle]] divided into three horizontal bands: the upper and lower, sips, and the central, argent. In the middle you can see a sinople rhombus with the coat of arms in the center. On August 15, 1895, Santa Catarina received a flag, designed by José Artur Boiteux. It had thirteen horizontal stripes of sips and argent in a quantity similar to that of districts in the state. Inside the sinople rhombus, jalde stars symbolized the municipalities.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20200623120411/https://www.sc.gov.br/conhecasc/simbolos SImbolos]</ref>

According to the [[2022 Brazilian census]] conducted by the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE), Santa Catarina has a total population of 7.6 million and a [[population density]] of 79.5 inhabitants per square kilometre. This ranks it as the [[List of Brazilian states by population|tenth most populous state in Brazil]], accounting for 3.75% of the country's total population.<ref name="Santa Catarina IBGE" /> The state's largest city, [[Joinville]], has a population of 616,317, making it the 34th most populous city in Brazil.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brasil {{!}} Santa Catarina {{!}} Joinville |url=https://cidades.ibge.gov.br/brasil/sc/joinville/panorama |access-date=2024-02-15 |website=cidades.ibge.gov.br}}</ref> Meanwhile, its capital, [[Florianópolis]], which is the state's second-largest city, has a population of 537,211, ranking it 39th among Brazilian municipalities by population.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brasil {{!}} Santa Catarina {{!}} Florianópolis |url=https://cidades.ibge.gov.br/brasil/sc/florianopolis/panorama |access-date=2024-02-15 |website=cidades.ibge.gov.br}}</ref>

The population grew by approximately 1.3 million inhabitants since 2010, representing an increase of 21.79% between 2010 and 2022. In 2022, around 50.71% of the population (3,859,258 people) were [[female]], whilst about 49.28% of the population (3,751,103 people) were [[male]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Panorama do Censo 2022 |url=https://censo2022.ibge.gov.br/panorama/ |access-date=2024-02-15 |website=Panorama do Censo 2022 |language=pt-BR}}</ref>

The [[Human Development Index]] of Santa Catarina is considered high according to the [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]]. According to the latest Atlas of Human Development in Brazil, released in 2023 with data pertaining to 2021, the state has the 3rd highest HDI among the federal units in Brazil, with an overall index of 0.792. Breaking down the index into indicators of income, education, and life expectancy, the state ranks 4th in [[income]] (with an index of 0.759), 3rd in [[education]] (with an index of 0.790), and 3rd in [[life expectancy]] (with an index of 0.827).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Atlas Brasil |url=http://www.atlasbrasil.org.br/ranking |access-date=2024-02-15 |website=www.atlasbrasil.org.br}}</ref><ref name="Santa Catarina IBGE" /> The [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] indicators of Santa Catarina rank among the best in Brazil.

Historically, the region was primarily inhabited by the [[Kaingang]], [[Xokleng]], and [[Guaraní people|Guarani]] peoples, whose populations were reduced since the beginning of colonisation but have survived to the present day. During [[colonial Brazil]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] colonisers were the first to initiate settlement in the territory of Santa Catarina.<ref name=":26" /><ref name=":27" /><ref name=":28" /> However, the territory later came under Portuguese control, marked by [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] immigration and the arrival of [[Slavery in Brazil|African slaves]].<ref name=":25" /> Subsequently, the territory experienced further population growth with the arrival of more Portuguese (especially [[Azoreans]]) and other European immigrants ([[Italians]], [[Germans]], [[Polish people|Poles]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Lithuanians]], [[Jews]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Belgians]], [[Swiss people|Swiss]], [[Austrians]], [[French people|French]], [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Norwegians]], [[Swedes]], [[Danes]], [[Czechs]], [[Slovaks]], [[Greeks]], and [[Russians]]), as well as by the [[Japanese people|Japanese]].<ref name=":26" /><ref name=":27" /><ref name=":28" />

[[File:Centro chapeco.jpg|right|thumb|[[Chapecó]] is the main city in the West of Santa Catarina.]]

Santa Catarina has one of the highest standards of living in Brazil and is a major industrial and agricultural center. The capital city, Florianópolis, has a diversified economy, being an important location for the technology industry and a major tourist destination. Commerce and services are also very strong in the capital. Cities in Florianópolis metro area, like São José, Palhoça, and Biguaçu are important and diverse industrial centers, as well as strong commercial areas. In the northeast of the state, electric-mechanical, textile and furniture industries are strong; in the west, cattle and poultry breeding predominate, while in the south it is ceramics and shellfish. The corridor between Joinville, Jaraguá do Sul and Blumenau is heavily industrialized—more than 50% of the state's industrial output is concentrated in this small, but highly developed area.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

In agriculture, the state stands out in the production of rice, apple and onion, in addition to significant production of [[soy]], maize, banana, grape, garlic, [[barley]], wheat and [[yerba mate]].{{cn|date=December 2022}}

With only 1.12% of the national territory, Santa Catarina was the eighth-largest producer of maize and the eleventh-largest producer of [[soybeans]] in Brazil, in the year 2017. When production per unit area is considered, the State becomes the national leader in corn, with an average of 8,100 kilograms per hectare, and second in soybeans, with 3.580 kilos per hectare.

Santa Catarina is one of the few states in the country that cultivate [[barley]]. In the 2007–2011 period, the state had 2.5% of national production. The cultivation was concentrated in the microregions of [[Canoinhas]] (57.6%), [[Curitibanos]] (26.5%) and [[Xanxerê]] (11.5%). It is also one of the few states that cultivate wheat, due to its favourable climate. In 2019 the estimated production of the state was 150,000 tons, still small compared to the 2.3&nbsp;million tons produced by both Rio Grande do Sul and Paraná.

Santa Catarina is the largest coal producer in Brazil, mainly in [[Criciúma]] city and its surroundings. The production of crude mineral coal in Brazil was 13.6&nbsp;million tons (Mt) in 2007. Santa Catarina produced 8.7 Mt; the Rio Grande do Sul, 4.5 Mt; and Paraná, 0.4 Mt. Despite the extraction of mineral coal in Brazil, the country still needs to import about 50% of the coal consumed, as the coal produced in the country is of low quality, with a lower concentration of carbon. Brazil's coal reserves are 32&nbsp;billion tons and are mainly in the Rio Grande do Sul (89.25% of the total), followed by Santa Catarina (10.41%). The Candiota Deposit (RS) alone has 38% of all national coal. As it is the coal of inferior quality, it is used only in the generation of thermoelectric energy and at the site of the deposit. The oil crisis in the 1970s led the Brazilian government to create the Energy Mobilization Plan, with intense efforts to discover new coal reserves. The Geological Survey of Brazil, through works carried out in the Rio Grande, do Sul and Santa Catarina greatly increased the reserves of coal previously known, between 1970 and 1986 (mainly between 1978 and 1983). In 2011, coal accounted for only 5.6% of the energy consumed in Brazil, but it is a strategic alternate source that can be activated when, for example, low water levels in dams reduce hydroelectric power generation. This happened in 2013, when several thermoelectric plants were shut down to maintain the necessary supply, albeit at a higher cost.<ref>[http://www.cprm.gov.br/publique/Redes-Institucionais/Rede-de-Bibliotecas---Rede-Ametista/Carvao-Mineral-2558.html Carvão Mineral]</ref><ref>[https://tecnicoemineracao.com.br/carvao-mineral-no-brasil-e-no-mundo/ Carvão mineral no Brasil e no mundo]</ref>

Santa Catarina had an [[Secondary sector of the economy|industrial]] GDP of R$63.2&nbsp;billion in 2017, equivalent to 5.3% of the national industry. It employs 761,072 workers in the industry. The main sectors are Construction (17.9%), Food (15.9%), Clothing (7.4%), Industrial Public Utility Services, such as Electricity and Water (6.9%), and Textiles (6.0%). These 5 sectors constitute 54.1% of the state's industry.<ref>[http://perfildaindustria.portaldaindustria.com.br/estado/sc Santa Catarina Industry Profile]</ref>

The main industrial centers in Santa Catarina are Jaraguá do Sul, Joinville, Chapecó and Blumenau. The first is diversified, with factories of fabrics, food products, foundries, and the mechanical industry. Chapecó's economy is based on [[agribusiness]]. Blumenau concentrates on the textile industry (together with Gaspar and Brusque) and recently also on software. In the interior of the state, there are numerous small manufacturing centers, linked to both the use of wood in industry and the processing of agricultural and pastoral products.

In the [[textile industry]], Santa Catarina stands out. Brazil, despite being among the five largest producers in the world in 2013, and a large consumer of textile and clothing, do not participate proportionately in global trade. In 2015, Brazilian imports ranked 25th (US$5.5&nbsp;billion), and in exports, it was only 40th in the world. At 0.3% market share in the global textile and clothing trade, Brazil is constrained by uncompetitive pricing compared to producers in China and India. The gross value of production, which includes consumption of intermediate goods and services, by the Brazilian textile industry, corresponds to almost R$40&nbsp;billion in 2015, 1.6% of the gross value of Industrial Production in Brazil. The South has 32.65% of production, Among the main textile clusters in Brazil, the Vale do Itajaí (SC) stand out. In 2015, Santa Catarina was the second-largest textile and clothing employer in Brazil.

An interesting collaboration between humans and wildlife has developed in [[Laguna, Santa Catarina|Laguna]] (birthplace of [[Anita Garibaldi]], the wife and comrade-in-arms of [[Italian Unification]] revolutionary [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]): a pod of [[bottlenose dolphin]]s drive fish towards fishermen who stand at the beach in shallow waters. Then one dolphin rolls over, which the fishermen take as a sign to cast their nets. The dolphins feed on the escaping fish. The dolphins were not trained for this behavior; the collaboration has been reported since 1847.<ref>''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (2006), [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/southamerica/brazil/734722/Brazils-sexiest-secret.html "Brazil's sexiest secret"], article retrieved 20 March 2009.</ref><ref>Moti Nissani (2007) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECk0yMifmzw Bottlenose Dolphins in Laguna Requesting a Throw Net] (video).
