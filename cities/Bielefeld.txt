Founded in 1214 by Count Hermann IV of [[County of Ravensberg|Ravensberg]] to guard a pass crossing the [[Teutoburg Forest]], Bielefeld was the "city of [[linen]]" as a minor member of the [[Hanseatic League]], known for [[bleachfields]] into the 19th century.<ref>''Hamburgh Mail'', The Times 14 December 1816</ref> Bielefeld was part of the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] when it was created in 1807.<ref>[[The Times]], 9 November 1809; ''Letters to the Editor''</ref> In 1815 it was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] following the defeat of France and the [[Congress of Vienna]].<ref>The Times, 26 August 1815; ''News''</ref>

After the Cologne-Minden railway [[Bad Oeynhausen#History|opened in 1849]], the Bozi brothers constructed the first large mechanised spinning mill in 1851. The Ravensberg Spinning Mill was built from 1854 to 1857, and metal works began to open in the 1860s.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

Founded in 1867 as a Bielefeld sewing machine repair company, Dürkoppwerke AG employed 1,665 people in 1892; it used [[Waffenamt]] code "WaA547" from 1938 to 1939 as the Dürkopp-Werke, and merged with other Bielefeld companies to form [[Durkopp Adler|Dürkopp Adler AG]] in 1990.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

Between 1904 and 1930, Bielefeld grew, opening a rebuilt railway station, a municipal theatre, and finally, the [[Rudolf-Oetker-Halle]] concert hall, renowned for its excellent acoustics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bielefeld.de/en/history/ |title=Bielefeld – History |publisher=Bielefeld.de |access-date=5 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427102530/http://www.bielefeld.de/en/history/ |archive-date=27 April 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[List of German cars|Dürkopp car was produced 1898–1927]]. After printing emergency money ({{langx|de|[[Notgeld]]}}) in 1923 during the [[inflation in the Weimar Republic]], Bielefeld was one of several towns that printed very attractive and highly collectable [[banknote]]s with designs on [[silk]], [[linen]] and [[velvet]]. These pieces were issued by the Bielefeld Stadtsparkasse (town's savings bank) and were sent all around the world in the early 1920s. These pieces are known as ''Stoffgeld''&nbsp;– that is, money made from fabric.<ref>Many examples can be found on the {{cite web |url=http://www.notgeld.com |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010231515/http://www.notgeld.com/ |archive-date=10 October 2016 }} website, where a new catalogue listing all the variants of different coloured borders and edges made on the 100m piece is being compiled.</ref>

The town's [[synagogue]] was burned in 1938 during the ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' pogrom carried out against Jewish population.

Due to the presence of a number of barracks built during the 1930s and its location next to the main East-West Autobahn in northern Germany, after World War II Bielefeld became a headquarters town for the fighting command of the [[British Army of the Rhine]] – BAOR (the administrative and strategic headquarters were at [[Rheindahlen]] near the Dutch border). Until the 1980s there was a large British presence in the barracks housing the headquarters of the British [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|First Corps]] and support units, as well as schools, [[Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes|NAAFI]] shops, officers' and sergeants' messes and several estates of married quarters. The British presence was heavily scaled back after the [[reunification of Germany]] and most of the infrastructure has disappeared.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

In 1973 the first villages on the south side of the Teutoburg Forest were incorporated.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

Starting in 1994, the city has been featured in the humorous [[Bielefeld conspiracy]] which satirises [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] by claiming that the city does not exist.

Bielefeld was a linen-producing town, and in the early 1920s the Town's Savings Bank (Stadtsparkasse) issued money made of linen, silk and velvet. These items were known as 'stoffgeld'.

In addition to the manufacture of [[home appliances]] and various [[heavy industry|heavy industries]], Bielefeld companies include [[Dr. Oetker]] (food manufacturing), Möller Group (leather products and plastics), Seidensticker (clothing and textiles) and [[Bethel Institution]] with 17.000 employees.

[[Bielefeld University]] was founded in 1969. The first professors included the well-known German sociologist [[Niklas Luhmann]].

==Transport==
Two major ''[[autobahn]]s'', the [[Bundesautobahn 2|A&nbsp;2]] and [[Bundesautobahn 33|A&nbsp;33]], intersect in the south east of Bielefeld. The ''Ostwestfalendamm'' expressway connects the two parts of the city, naturally divided by the Teutoburg Forest. [[Bielefeld Hauptbahnhof]], the main railway station of Bielefeld, is on the [[Hamm–Minden railway]] and is part of the German [[Intercity-Express|ICE]] high-speed railroad system. The main station for [[intercity bus service]]s is [[Brackwede station]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/bielefeld|title=Bielefeld: Stations|publisher=Travelinho.com|access-date=21 November 2017|archive-date=27 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227150220/http://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/bielefeld|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Bielefeld has a small airstrip, Flugplatz Bielefeld,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flugplatz-bielefeld.de/ |title=Flugplatz Bielefeld |publisher=Flugplatz-bielefeld.de |access-date=7 April 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011734/http://www.flugplatz-bielefeld.de/| archive-date= 29 April 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> in the [[Senne (Germany)|Senne]] district but is mainly served by the three larger airports nearby, [[Paderborn Lippstadt Airport]], [[Münster Osnabrück Airport]] and [[Hannover Airport]].

Bielefeld boasts a well-developed public transport system, served mainly by the companies ''moBiel''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobiel.de/|title=Startseite – moBiel.de}}</ref> (formerly ''Stadtwerke Bielefeld – Verkehrsbetriebe'') and "BVO".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bvo-bielefeld.de/|title=Ostwestfalen-Lippe-Bus|first=Deutsche Bahn AG, Unternehmensbereich Personenverkehr, Marketing|last=eCommerce}}</ref> The [[Bielefeld Stadtbahn]] has four major lines and regional trains connect different parts of the city with nearby counties. Buses also run throughout the area.

==Main sights==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2021}}
[[Sparrenberg Castle|Sparrenburg Castle]] is Bielefeld's characteristic landmark. It was built between 1240 and 1250 by Count Ludwig von [[County of Ravensberg|Ravensberg]]. The {{convert|37|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} tower and the catacombs of the castle are open to the public.

The Linen Weavers' Monument, with the German name Leineweber-Denkmal, created by the Tyrolean sculptor Perathoner, has been one of Bielefeld's most recognisable symbols for over 100 years. It stands as a reminder of the time when the city gained importance through the production of [[linen]], with the traditional crafts of spinning and weaving, and its high-quality linen became known worldwide, characterised by its own seal of quality.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-10-23 |title=Leineweber-Denkmal {{!}} Bielefeld.JETZT |url=https://www.bielefeld.jetzt/leineweber-denkmal |access-date=2024-10-23 |website=www.bielefeld.jetzt |language=de}}</ref>

The Old City Hall (''Altes Rathaus'') was built in 1904 and still serves the same function. Its façade reflects the so-called [[Weserrenaissance]] and features elements of various [[Architecture|architectural styles]], including [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Renaissance]]. Though the mayor still holds office in the Old City Hall, most of the city's administration is housed in the adjacent '''New City Hall''' (''Neues Rathaus'').

The City Theatre (''Stadttheater'') is part of the same architectural ensemble as the Old City Hall, also built in 1904. It has a notable [[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]] façade, is Bielefeld's largest theatre and home of the [[Bielefeld Opera]]. Another theatre (''Theater am Alten Markt'') resides in the former [[City and town halls|town hall]] building on the Old Market Square (''Alter Markt''), which also contains a row of restored 16th and 17th-century townhouses with noteworthy late Gothic and [[Weser Renaissance]] style façades (''Bürgerhäuser am Alten Markt'').

The oldest city church is ''Altstädter Nicolaikirche''. It is a Gothic [[hall church]] with a height of {{convert|81.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It was founded in 1236 by the [[Bishopric of Paderborn|Bishop of Paderborn]], and enlarged at the beginning of the 14th century. The church was damaged in World War II and later rebuilt. Three times a day, a [[carillon]] can be heard. The most valuable treasure of this church is a carved altar from [[Antwerp]], decorated with 250 figures. A small museum housed within illustrates the history of the church up to World War II.

The largest church is the ''Neustädter Marienkirche'', a Gothic hall church dating back to 1293, completed 1512. It stands {{convert|78|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall and has a length of {{convert|52|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Historically speaking, this building is considered to be the most precious possession of the town. It was the starting point of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in Bielefeld in 1553. A valuable wing-altar with 13 pictures, known as the ''Marienaltar'' is also kept inside. The [[baroque]] [[spire]]s were destroyed in World War II and later replaced by two unusually-shaped "Gothic" clocktowers. The altarpiece of the Bielefeld church ''Neustädter Marienkirche'' from around 1400 is among the most prominent masterpieces of artwork of the German Middle Ages. Two of the altarpieces, ''The Flagellation'' and ''The Crucifixion'' are now in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]].

Bielefeld is also the seat of the two largest [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Social welfare provision|social welfare]] establishments (''Diakonie'') in [[Europe]], the [[Bethel Institution]] and the ''Evangelisches Johanneswerk''.

Other important cultural sights of the region are the [[Kunsthalle Bielefeld|art museum (Kunsthalle)]], the [[Rudolf-Oetker-Halle]] concert hall, and the city's municipal [[botanical garden]] ([[Botanischer Garten Bielefeld]]). Bielefeld is home to the widely known [[Bielefelder Kinderchor]], founded in 1932 by [[Friedrich Oberschelp]] as the first mixed children's choir in Germany. It became famous for its recordings and concerts of traditional German Christmas carols, filling the Rudolf-Oetker-Halle several times each season. Foreign tours have taken the choir to many European countries, and also the U.S. and Japan.

On [[Hünenburg Observation Tower|Hünenburg]] there is an [[observation tower]], next to a {{convert|164|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} [[Radio masts and towers|radio tower]].
