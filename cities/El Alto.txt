The El Alto–La Paz metropolitan area, formed by La Paz, El Alto, [[Achocalla Municipality|Achocalla]], [[Viacha Municipality|Viacha]], and [[Mecapaca Municipality|Mecapaca]], constitutes the most populous urban area of Bolivia, with a population of about 2.2 million. The city is rapidly developing, although significant challenges with substandard infrastructure and utilities remain, especially in the outlying areas. The construction of an [[Mi Teleférico|elaborate cable car system]] connected El Alto directly with central La Paz, dramatically easing transportation into the economic center of the metropolitan area. A locally indigenous [[Neo-Andean]] architectural style has developed alongside this growth, giving the city a distinct appearance as it has modernized. 

==History==
The dry and inclement plain above La Paz was uninhabited until 1903 when the newly built railways from [[Lake Titicaca]] and [[Arica, Chile|Arica]] reached the rim of the canyon, where the La Paz terminus, railyards and depots were built along with a settlement of railway workers (a spur line down into the canyon opened in 1905). In 1925, the airfield was built as a base for the new air force, which attracted additional settlement. In 1939, El Alto's first elementary school opened. El Alto started to grow tremendously in the 1950s when the settlement was connected to La Paz's water supply (before this, all water had to be transported from La Paz in tanker vehicles) and building land in the canyon became more and more scarce and expensive. In an administrative reform in March 1985, the district of El Alto and its surroundings were politically separated from the City of La Paz (this date is officially referred to and celebrated as the city's "founding day"). In 1987, El Alto was [[Municipal corporation|formally incorporated]] as a city. In 1994, the city became the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of El Alto]].

===Districts===
El Alto's autonomous government identifies 14 districts composing the city.

==Demographics==
El Alto was once known as La Paz's bedroom community, though recent growth of commerce and industry has led to concern about water pollution by businesses, including tanneries and slaughterhouses, for the city and communities downstream.<ref>{{cite news |last=Shahriari |first=Sara |title=Urban population boom threatens Lake Titicaca |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/12/urban-population-boom-lake-titicaca|access-date=26 May 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 Jan 2012}}</ref> Rapid population growth means the city struggles to bring potable water and sewer service to parts of the population, especially on the fringes of the expanding urban area.<ref>{{cite news |last=Shahriari |first=Sara |title=Dry Toilets: The Answer to a Bolivian City's Sewage Crisis? |url=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/bolivia-lake-titicaca-sewage-contamination-dry-ecological-toilets-sumaj-huasi-health-aquatic-life-compost|access-date=26 May 2012 |newspaper=The Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting |date=25 Jan 2012}}</ref>

==Geography==
The city contains La Paz’s [[El Alto International Airport]]. El Alto is one of the highest major cities in the world, up to 4,300 meters (13,615 feet) above mean sea level. It has a cold climate, with the highest average monthly maximum temperature being {{cvt|17|C|F}} in November. It is one of the fastest-growing cities in Bolivia, due to immigration from Bolivia’s rural areas to the La Paz region which started with the rural reform of 1952 and increased in the last 10 years. Some migrants say the difficulty of growing crops in the countryside drove them to move to the city.<ref>{{cite news |last=Vidal |first=John |title=El Alto, city of rural migrants whose crops failed when the climate changed |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/apr/12/bolivia-crop-failure-climate-change|access-date=26 May 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 April 2011}}</ref>

===Climate===
The [[Köppen climate classification system]] classifies El Alto's climate as a rare cold-summer variety of a [[subtropical highland climate]] (''Cwc''). Temperatures are typically cool during the day and crisp at night year-round. Snowfall is possible at any time during the year.

The [[water supply]] in El Alto has been impacted by drought caused by shrinking glaciers.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/14/science/earth/14bolivia.html |title=In Bolivia, Water and Ice Tell of Climate Change |last=Rosenthal |first=Elisabeth |date=2009-12-13 |work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-09-28 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In 2016 the three main dams supplying water to the city were almost dry due to lack of glacial melt water.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/28/shrinking-glaciers-state-of-emergency-drought-bolivia |title=Shrinking glaciers cause state-of-emergency drought in Bolivia |last=Rocha |first=Jan |date=2016-11-28 |work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-09-28 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

[[Museo de Arte Antonio Paredes Candia]] opened in 2002. From 2003, access from La Paz to the international airport, as well to oil and gas supplies, has been frequently blocked by protesting social leaders and some of the most powerful players in the [[politics of Bolivia]]. El Alto remains one of the major centers of the [[Bolivian gas conflict]].

El Alto is known for its [[Neo-Andean]] architecture, built from the mid-2000s onward.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/architect-freddy-mamani-transformed-el-alto-bolivia-into-mecca-modern-architecture |title=Architect Freddy Mamani Has Transformed El Alto, Bolivia, Into a Mecca of Modern Architecture |last=Allen |first=Eric |date=25 July 2018 |website=Architectural Digest}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destinations/south-america/bolivia/el-alto-freddy-mamani-architecture/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523003847/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destinations/south-america/bolivia/el-alto-freddy-mamani-architecture/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 23, 2018 |title=These Vibrant, Futuristic Mansions Are Popping Up in Bolivia |last=Blair |first=Laurence |website=National Geographic |date=21 May 2018}}</ref><ref name=NYT51313>{{cite news |title=A Colorful Bolivian Bastion, Floating Above It All |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/world/americas/a-colorful-bolivian-bastion-floating-above-it-all.html|access-date=May 14, 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 13, 2013 |author=William Neuman}}</ref>
