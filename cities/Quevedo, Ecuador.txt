'''Quevedo''' is a city in [[Ecuador]] located in the [[Los Ríos Province]]. It is the seat of [[Quevedo Canton]], a vibrant community founded in 1943. According to the latest census, Quevedo's population is 177,792.<ref name="pop"/> Located at 237&nbsp;km SW of Quito (Ecuador's capital), or, 183&nbsp;km NE of Guayaquil (Ecuador's main port). Quevedo is one of the fastest-growing cities in Ecuador and it is mainly known for its agricultural tradition. Quevedo's agroindustrial complex is one of the leading exporters in the world of banana, cacao, passion fruit and coffee bean. In recent years non-agricultural activities have experienced significant progress mainly in the financial and educational sectors.

Though set inland, Quevedo's geographic location makes it an important logistics link between the Pacific coastal area's main population centers like [[Guayaquil]], Santo Domingo and [[Manta, Ecuador|Manta]] and cities in the Andes highlands such as [[Ambato, Ecuador|Ambato]] and [[Quito]].<ref>''http://www.quevedo.gov.ec/Site/Fijos/ciudad.aspx'',{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} "La Ciudad" Gobierno Municipal de Quevedo 10 August 2010</ref> Because of its location west of the [[Andes]] mountains and right next to the  [[Vinces River]] (a major waterway and tributary to the Pacific Ocean), the city is vulnerable to flooding.<ref>''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110725190258/http://www.columbiagazetteer.org/main/ViewPlace/0/115386] Columbia Gazetteer of the World, Quevedo 10 August 2010</ref>

==Economy==

Quevedo is one of the most important agricultural centers of Ecuador and is the geographical point where all major roads (including the Pan-American highway) in the region intersect. The area surrounding Quevedo mainly produce [[bananas]], [[corn]], [[rice]], and [[soybeans]].<ref>''http://www.elcomercio.com/2010-10-07/Noticias/Pais/Noticia-Principal/EC101007P17_QUEVEDO.aspx'',{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 'Quevedo, productivo y comercial' El Comercio 7 October 2010</ref> The alluvial soils in the region generate excellent harvests year-round. Many banana producers complement their banana plantations with fields that produce corn, soy and rice in the wet season. In the city, this produce is often industrialized into super-market ready products, such as instant-meals, pre-packaged products, noodles and other traditionally Asian foods. In recent years, Quevedo agro-industrial complex has added value to its output by developing a strong presence in the organic product's niche both locally and overseas.

==Geography==
===Climate===

==Education==

[[UTEQ]], Universidad Tecnica Estatal de Quevedo, is well known in Ecuador for its program in [[Agricultural sciences]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}.

==Sports==

[[Club Deportivo Quevedo]] is the local football team which has played in the Ecuadorian top division.

==Culture==

Mostly populated by the mestizo ethnic group; Quevedo is also known for its prominent [[China|Chinese]] [[immigrant]] population and has even been called the "[[Chinatown]] of Ecuador". This gives it a distinct reputation and cultural feeling in relation to other Ecuadorian cities.  Quevedo is also the center of the "montubio" folklore, a sub-culture that emanates from the customs of the early settlers of the region, who lived in the "monte", a word that describes the agricultural fields.

The city celebrates its foundation on October 7.
