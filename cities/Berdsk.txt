'''Berdsk''' ({{langx|ru|Бердск}}) is a [[Classification of inhabited localities in Russia#Urban localities|town]] in [[Novosibirsk Oblast]], [[Russia]]. A suburb of [[Novosibirsk]], it is on the [[Berd (river)|Berd River]]. In the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Russian census]], its population was {{Ru-census2010|97,296|punct=.}}

==Geography==
Berdsk is on the Berd River. Open land is south of the town and a pine forest covering about {{convert|20|km2|sp=us}} is on the west, between Berdsk and the Ob Sea (the [[Novosibirsk Reservoir]]).

==History==

The migration of Russians into present-day [[Novosibirsk Oblast]] began at the end of the 17th century and continued into the 18th century. The [[Siberia]]n colonists included fugitive peasants escaping [[Peter the Great]]'s oppression, [[Old Believers]], and hunters in search of furs in the Siberian woods.

By 1715, the Berd River basin had a significant population. The risk of nomad incursions from the south drove the people to demand that the [[Tomsk Oblast|Tomsk]] regional authorities build a defensive fortress. The fortress, at the confluence of the Berd and [[Ob (river)|Ob]] rivers, was protected by steep banks on two sides and dense forest on the third side. The Ob river valley could be seen from the banks. The [[Siberian Route]] was laid out nearby in 1730, encouraging the development of trade. At the beginning of the 19th century, a small amount of gold washed up from the upper Berd and the [[Salair Ridge]].

By the beginning of the 20th century, Berdsk became a grain-processing center. The local Gorokhov mill produced several types of flour which were distributed throughout Siberia, Russia and Europe via the [[Kara Sea]]. The nearby Altai Railway was built in 1915, connecting [[Novosibirsk|Novo-Nikolaevsk]], [[Barnaul]] and [[Biysk]].

Mobilization during [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Civil War]] which followed the [[October Revolution]] reduced Berdsk's population  by one-third. The town was an administrative center of the [[White movement]] and an underground [[Bolshevik]] center. The [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|Soviet collectivization of agriculture]] ended Siberia's role as an agricultural exporter.

Construction of the [[Novosibirsk Hydroelectric Station]] placed the main part of Berdsk in the [[Novosibirsk Reservoir]]'s flood zone. The town was evacuated several years before the reservoir was filled in 1957–1958, and the area around the railroad station was rebuilt. Bersk's oldest buildings date to 1915, and its streets form a grid. The town was home to a Soviet [[Biological agent|bioweapons]] production facility.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rao|first=Jason|title=From Berdsk to Burma: Lessons (and Adventures) in Global Health Diplomacy|journal=Science & Diplomacy|date=6 December 2012|volume=1|issue=4|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/letter-field/2012/berdsk-burma}}</ref>

==Transportation==
The [[R256 highway (Russia)|R256 highway]] passes through Berdsk, connecting Novosibirsk with [[Altai Krai]], the [[Altai Republic]] and [[Mongolia]]. Berdsk has a network of municipal and private bus routes, including intercity routes to Novosibirsk and [[Iskitim]]. The town's central railway station has a number of local ''[[Electric multiple unit|elektrichkas]]'' and long-distance trains to Altai Krai and [[Kazakhstan]]. Private river passenger or cargo traffic is negligible, although Berdsk has a pier for [[Barge#Types|sand barges]].

The town has two [[Palace of Culture|palaces of culture]]. There are three stadiums, five sports schools, a musical school, a museum of history and culture, a park, and a yacht club.

Students enroll in public school at age seven, and graduate eleven years later. Classes are about 40 minutes long. The school day begins at about 8:00 and ends between 12:00 and 14:00, depending on the age of the student. Many students augment their public-school education by attending private, specialized schools after the public-school day ends. Such schools may offer additional training in language, art, or technology.
