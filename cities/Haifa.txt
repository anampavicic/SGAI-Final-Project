Built on the slopes of [[Mount Carmel]], the settlement has a history spanning more than 3,000 years. The earliest known settlement in the vicinity was [[Tell Abu Hawam]], a small port city established in the Late [[Bronze Age]] (14th century BCE).<ref name=Judaica>[[Encyclopaedia Judaica|Encyclopedia Judaica]], ''Haifa'', Keter Publishing, Jerusalem, 1972, vol. 7, pp. 1134–1139</ref> In the 3rd century CE, Haifa was known as a [[Tool and die maker|dye-making]] center.

During the [[Battle of Haifa (1948)|Battle of Haifa]] in the [[1948 Palestine war]], most of the city's Arab population [[1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight|fled or were expelled]]. That year, the city became part of the then-newly-established state of Israel.

{{As of |2016}}, the city is a major [[Port of Haifa|seaport]] located on Israel's [[Israeli coastal plain|Mediterranean]] coastline in the Bay of Haifa covering {{cvt|63.7|km2|sqmi}}.

==Etymology==
[[File:Western Haifa from the air.jpg|thumb|Western Haifa from the air]]

The ultimate origin of the name Haifa remains unclear. One theory holds it derives from the name of the high priest [[Caiaphas]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}} Some Christians believe it was named for [[Saint Peter]], whose [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] name was Keipha.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}} Another theory holds it could be derived from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] verb root חפה (''hafa''), from H-f-h root (ח-פ-ה), meaning to cover or shield, i.e. Mount Carmel covers Haifa;<ref name=pardes>{{Cite book |first=Alex |last=Carmel |year=2002 |title=The History of Haifa Under Turkish Rule |edition=4th |publisher=Pardes |location=Haifa |isbn=978-965-7171-05-9 |language=he |page=14}}</ref> others point to a possible origin in the Hebrew word חוֹף (''hof''), meaning "shore", or חוֹף יָפֶה (''hof yafe''), meaning "beautiful shore".<ref name=pardes/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Amit-Kokhavi |first=Hanah |title=Haifa—sea and mountain, Arab past and Jewish present, as reflected by four writers |journal=Israel Studies |volume=2 |issue=3 |year=2006 |pages=142–167 |doi=10.1353/is.2006.0025 |s2cid=201768025| issn = 1084-9513 }}</ref>

==Locations and names==
===Sycaminum and Efa===
The earliest named settlement within the area of modern-day Haifa was the city Sycaminum.<ref name=Dumperp159 /> The remains of the ancient town can be found in a coastal [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]], or archaeological mound, known in Hebrew as {{transl|he|[[Tel Shikmona]]}},<ref name=Sharon /> meaning 'mound of the [[Ficus sycomorus]]', and in Arabic as {{transl|ar|Tell el-Semak}} or {{transl|ar|Tell es-Samak}}, meaning 'mound of the [[sumak]] trees', names that preserved and transformed the ancient name, by which the town is mentioned once in the [[Mishnah]] (composed c. 200 CE) for the wild fruits that grow around it.<ref name=Sharon>{{cite book |last=Sharon |first=Moshe |author-link=Moshe Sharon |author2=Fondation Max van Berchem |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1d8xHcor0psC&pg=PA99 |title=Corpus Inscriptionum Arabicarum Palaestinae addendum: squeezes in the Max van Berchem collection (Palestine, Trans-Jordan, Northern Syria) |edition=Illustrated |publisher=BRILL |year=2007 |isbn=978-90-04-15780-4 |access-date=2 July 2011 |archive-date=3 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803014841/https://books.google.com/books?id=1d8xHcor0psC&pg=PA99 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=PEF1875 />

The name ''Efa'' first appears during [[Palestine (region)#Roman rule (63 BC)|Roman rule]], some time after the end of the 1st century, when a Roman fortress and small Jewish settlement were established not far from Tel Shikmona.<ref name=Dumperp159>{{Cite book |last1=Dumper |first1=Michael |last2=Stanley |first2=Bruce E. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&pg=PA159 |title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: a historical encyclopedia |edition=Illustrated |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-57607-919-5 |access-date=2 July 2011 |archive-date=3 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803074834/https://books.google.com/books?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&pg=PA159 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=Sharon/> Haifa is also mentioned more than 100 times in the [[Talmud]], a work central to Judaism.<ref name=Sharon />

''Hefa'' or ''Hepha'' in [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s 4th-century work, ''Onomasticon'',<ref>''Onom.'' 108, 31</ref> is said to be another name for Sycaminus.<ref name=Negev>{{cite book |pages=213–214 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=27nq65cZUIgC&pg=PA213 |title=Archaeological encyclopedia of the Holy Land |first1=Avraham |last1=Negev |first2=Shimon |last2=Gibson |edition=4th, revised, illustrated |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8264-8571-7 |access-date=31 May 2020 |archive-date=2 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200802231716/https://books.google.com/books?id=27nq65cZUIgC&pg=PA213 |url-status=live}}</ref> This synonymizing of the names is explained by [[Moshe Sharon]], who writes that the twin ancient settlements, which he calls Haifa-Sycaminon, gradually expanded into one another, becoming a twin city known by the Greek names Sycaminon or Sycaminos Polis.<ref name=Sharon /> References to this city end with the Byzantine period.<ref name=Judaica/>

===Porphyreon===
Around the 6th century, ''Porphyreon'' or ''Porphyrea'' is mentioned in the writings of [[William of Tyre]],{{dubious|WRONG!

===Early Muslim Haifa===
Following the Arab conquest in the 7th century, ''Haifa'' was used to refer to a site established on Tel Shikmona upon what were already the ruins of Sycaminon (Shiqmona).<ref name=Sharon /> Haifa (or Haifah) is mentioned by the mid-11th-century Persian chronicler [[Nasir Khusraw]], and the 12th- and 13th-century Arab chroniclers, [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] and [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]].<ref name=Strange /> [[Nasir-i-Khusrau]] visited in 1047; he noted that "Haifa lies on the seashore, and there are here palm-gardens and trees in numbers.

===Late Ottoman "Old Haifa"===
{{transl|apc|Haifa al-'Atiqa}} (Arabic: 'Ancient Haifa') is another name used by some locals to refer to Tell es-Samak, when it was the site of a hamlet of 250 residents, before the settlement was moved in 1764–5 to the site from which the modern city emerged.<ref name=Seikalyp15/>

===Bronze Age: Tell Abu Hawam===
A town known today as Tell Abu Hawam was established during the Late Bronze Age (14th century BCE).<ref name=Judaica/> It was a port and fishing village.

===In the Hebrew Bible===
[[Mount Carmel]] and the [[Kishon River]] are mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]].<ref name=kings>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:9|HE}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-Kishon.html |title=Kishon |publisher=[[Encyclopedia.com]]  |access-date=20 March 2008 |archive-date=19 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219072600/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-Kishon.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Persian and Hellenistic period: near Shikmona===
In the 6th century BCE, during the Persian period, Greek geographer [[Scylax of Caryanda|Scylax]] wrote of a city "between the bay and the Promontory of Zeus" (i.e., the Carmel), which may be a reference to [[Shikmona]], a locality in the Haifa area.<ref name=Judaica/>

By [[Hellenistic]] times, the city had moved to a new site south of what is now the [[Bat Galim]] neighborhood of modern Haifa because the old port's harbour had become blocked with sand.<ref name=Judaica/> A [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking population living along the coast at this time was engaged in commerce.<ref>''Haifa'', The Guide to Israel, Zev Vilnay, Jerusalem, 1970, p.382</ref>

====Shikmona====
Haifa was located near the town of Shikmona, a center for making the traditional [[Tzitzit#Tekhelet|Tekhelet]] dye used in the garments of the high priests in the Temple. The [[archaeological site]] of Shikmona is southwest of Bat Galim.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mushecht.haifa.ac.il/hecht/abstract/15e/Abstracts.pdf |title=Two Tombstones from Zoar in the Hecht Museum Collection |publisher=Haifa University |access-date=25 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226230016/http://mushecht.haifa.ac.il/hecht/abstract/15e/Abstracts.pdf |archive-date=26 February 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Roman period===
In about the 3rd century CE, Haifa was first mentioned in Talmudic literature, as a Jewish fishing village and the home of Rabbi [[Avdimi of Haifa|Avdimi]] and other Jewish scholars. According to the Talmud, fishermen caught [[Murex]], sea snails which yielded purple dye used to make ''[[tallit]]'' (Jewish prayer shawls) from Haifa to the [[Ladder of the Tyrians]].

In the 9th century under the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate]]s, Haifa established trading relations with Egyptian ports and the city featured several shipyards.

In his rather strange Latin style, he mentions that there was a Jewish population in Haifa, and that they fought bravely on the walls of the city. He explains that the Jews there were protected people of the Muslims (the Fatimids). They fought side by side with units of the Fatimid army, striking back at Tancred's army from above the walls of the citadel (...

Haifa's development owed much to British plans to make it a central port and hub for Middle-East crude oil. The British Government of Palestine developed the port and built [[Consolidated Refineries|refineries]], thereby facilitating the rapid development of the city as a center for the country's heavy industries. Haifa was also among the first towns to be fully electrified.

===1947–1948 Civil War in Palestine===

The [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|1947 UN Partition Plan]] in late November 1947 designated Haifa as part of the proposed [[Jewish state]]. Arab protests over that decision evolved into violence between Jews and Arabs that left several dozen people dead during December.<ref>Palestine Post, many issues December 1947.</ref> The Arab city was in a state of chaos. The local Arab national committee tried to stabilize the situation by organizing garrison, calming the frightened residents and to stop the flight. In a public statement, the national committee called upon the Arab residents to obey orders, be alert, keep calm, and added: "Keep away the cowards who wish to flee. Expell them from your lines. Despise them, because they harm more than the enemy". Despite the efforts, Arab residents abandoned the streets which bordered Jewish neighborhoods and during the days of the general strike instigated by the [[Arab Higher Committee]], some 250 Arab families abandoned the Khalisa neighborhood.<ref>[[Yoav Gelber]], ''Independence Versus Nakba''; Kinneret–Zmora-Bitan–Dvir Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|978-965-517-190-7}}, pp.136–137</ref>

On 30 December 1947, members of the [[Irgun]], a Jewish underground militia, threw bombs into a crowd of Arabs outside the gates of the [[Consolidated Refineries]] in Haifa, killing six and injuring 42. In response, Arab employees of the company killed 39 Jewish employees in what became known as the [[Haifa Oil Refinery massacre]].<ref>{{Citation |title=The Israel/Palestine Question |author-link=Ilan Pappé |first=Ilan |last=Pappé |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-415-16947-9}}</ref> The Jewish [[Haganah]] militia retaliated with a raid on the Arab village of [[Balad al-Shaykh]], where many of the Arab refinery workers lived, in what became known as the [[Balad al-Shaykh massacre]].<ref>Benny Morris, ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited'', p101.</ref>

[[British Armed Forces|British forces]] in Haifa redeployed on 21 April 1948, withdrawing from most of the city while still maintaining control over the port facilities. According to Ilan Pappé, although the Jewish mayor of the city, [[Shabtai Levy]], urged the Arab residents to stay, in other parts of town loudspeakers could be heard ordering Arabs to leave "before it's too late."<ref>Pappe, Ilan. ''The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine'', p. 95</ref>

On 21 April, the downtown, controlled by a combination of local and foreign (ALA) Arab irregulars, was assaulted by [[Yishuv|Jewish]] forces in [[Battle of Haifa (1948)|Operation Bi'ur Hametz]] by the [[Barak Armored Brigade|Carmeli Brigade]] of the Haganah, commanded by [[Moshe Carmel]].

The operation led to a massive displacement of Haifa's Arab population, and was part of the larger [[1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight]].

After the [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel]] on 14 May 1948 Haifa became the gateway for Jewish immigration into Israel. During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the neighborhoods of Haifa were sometimes contested. After the war, Jewish immigrants were settled in new neighborhoods, among them [[Kiryat Haim|Kiryat Hayim]], Ramot Remez, Ramat Shaul, [[Kiryat Sprinzak]], and [[Kiryat Eliezer, Haifa|Kiryat Eliezer]].

===Flora and fauna===
The Carmel Mountain has three main [[wadi]]s: Lotem, Amik and Si'ach. For the most part these valleys are undeveloped natural corridors that run up through the city from the coast to the top of the mountain. Marked hiking paths traverse these areas and they provide habitat for wildlife such as wild boar, [[golden jackal]], [[hyrax]], [[Egyptian mongoose]], owls and chameleons.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

Haifa is inundated with [[Wild boar|boars]]. The boars began to descend from the valleys around the city from before 2019, and began to roam in the city's streets. In 2019, mayor Einat Kalisch-Rotem decided to stop shooting the boars.<ref name="Where Boars Hog the Streets">{{cite web |last1=Kingsley |first1=Patrick |title=Where Boars Hog the Streets |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/world/middleeast/haifa-israel-wild-boars.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=10 February 2024 |date=9 April 2021}}</ref> Boar sighting figures have struggled to go down since the [[Israel Nature and Parks Authority]] began fencing off forested areas, because residents often feed the boars.<ref name="Kingsley">{{cite web |title=Well-meaning Residents Foil Haifa's Efforts to Tame Wild Boar Problem |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2022-12-10/ty-article/.premium/well-meaning-residents-foil-haifas-efforts-to-tame-wild-boar-problem/00000184-fd69-d4c7-a786-fdffd11e0000 |website=Haaretz |access-date=10 February 2024 |language=en}}</ref>

==Neighborhoods==
{{main|Neighborhoods of Haifa}}
[[File:Israel - Haifa - view 001.jpg|thumb|Bat Galim neighborhood and [[Haifa Bay]]]]
[[File:Haifa 3082-1.jpg|thumb|Panorama Towers]]

Haifa has developed in tiers, from the lower to the upper city on the Carmel. The oldest neighborhood in modern Haifa is Wadi Salib, the Old City center near the port, which has been bisected by a major road and razed in part to make way for [[Government Buildings]]. Wadi Salib stretches across to [[Wadi Nisnas]], the center of Arab life in Haifa today. In the 19th century, under Ottoman rule, the German Colony was built, providing the first model of [[urban planning]] in Haifa. Some of the buildings have been restored and the colony has turned into a center of Haifa nightlife.<ref name=tiers/>

The first buildings in Hadar were constructed at the start of the 20th century. Hadar was Haifa's cultural center and marketplace throughout the 1920s and into the 1980s, nestled above and around Haifa's Arab neighborhoods. Today Hadar stretches from the port area near the bay, approximately halfway up Mount Carmel, around the [[German Colony, Haifa|German Colony]], [[Wadi Nisnas]] and [[Wadi Salib]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vie/viehaifa.html |title=Haifa |encyclopedia=Jewish Virtual Library |access-date=21 March 2008 |date=|archive-date=14 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514231928/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vie/viehaifa.html |url-status=live}}</ref> Hadar houses two commercial centers (one in the port area, and one midway up the mountain) surrounded by some of the city's older neighborhoods.

[[Neve Sha'anan, Haifa|Neve Sha'anan]], a neighborhood located on the second tier of Mount Carmel, was founded in the 1920s. West of the port are the neighborhoods of Bat Galim, Shikmona Beach, and Kiryat Eliezer. To the west and east of Hadar are the Arab neighborhoods of Abbas and Khalisa, built in the 1960s and 70s.<ref name=go>{{cite web |url=http://www.goisrael.com/Tourism_Euk/Tourist+Information/Discover+Israel/Cities/Haifa.htm |title=Haifa |publisher=Israel Government Tourism Ministry |access-date=21 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108130722/http://www.goisrael.com/Tourism_Euk/Tourist+Information/Discover+Israel/Cities/Haifa.htm |archive-date=8 January 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> To the south of Mount Carmel's headland, along the road to Tel Aviv, are the neighborhoods of [[Ein HaYam (Wadi al-Jimal)|Ein HaYam]], Shaar HaAliya, Kiryat Sprinzak and Neve David.

Above Hadar are affluent neighborhoods such as the Carmel Tzarfati ([[French Carmel]]), [[Merkaz HaCarmel]] (Carmel Center), [[Ramot Ben Gurion|Romema]] (Ramot Ben Gurion), Ahuzat HaCarmel (Ahuza), Carmeliya, [[Vardiya]], [[Ramat Golda]], [[Ramat Alon]] and [[Denia, Haifa|Hod Ha'Carmel (Denya)]]. While there are general divisions between Arab and Jewish neighborhoods, there is an increasing trend for wealthy Arabs to move into affluent Jewish neighborhoods.<ref name=demo/> Another Carmel neighborhood is [[Kababir]], home to the National Headquarters of Israel's [[Ahmadiyya Community]];<ref name=go/> located near Merkaz HaCarmel and overlooking the coast.

The neighborhood of Wadi Salib, located in the heart of downtown Haifa, is being redeveloped. Most of its Jewish and Arab residents are considered squatters and have been gradually evicted over the years. The Haifa Economic Corporation Ltd is developing two 1,000 square meter lots for office and commercial use.<ref>[http://www.hec.co.il/Calcalit/Templates/showpage.asp?DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=84&FID=276 Haifa Economic Corporation Ltd: Wadi Salib] Haifa Economic Corporation {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Some historic buildings have been renovated and redeveloped, especially into nightclubs and theaters, such as the Palace of the Pasha, a [[Turkish bath]]house, and a [[Middle Eastern music]] and [[Nightclub|dance club]], which has been converted into theaters and offices.<ref name=Johal />

In 2012, a new, massive development plan was announced for Haifa's waterfront. According to the plan, the western section of the city's port will be torn down, and all port activity will be moved to the east. The west side of the port will be transformed into a tourism and nightlife center and a point of embarkation and arrival for sea travel through the construction of public spaces, a beach promenade, and the renovation of commercial buildings. The train tracks that currently bisect the city and separate the city's beach from the rest of Haifa will also be buried.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4250979,00.html |title=Plan aims to turn Haifa into 'the Barcelona of Israel' |newspaper=Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |access-date=12 March 2013 |archive-date=26 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226232047/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4250979,00.html |url-status=live|last1=Shauli |first1=Alphi }}</ref> A park will be developed on the border of the Kishon River, the refineries' cooling towers will be turned into a visitors' center, and bridges will lead from the port to the rest of the city.

Another plan seeks to turn the western section of Haifa Port into a major tourism and nightlife center, as well as a functioning point of embarkation and arrival for sea travel. All port activity will be moved to the western side, and the area will be redeveloped. Public spaces and a beach promenade will be developed, and commercial buildings will be renovated.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4250979,00.html |title=Plan aims to turn Haifa into 'the Barcelona of Israel' |newspaper=Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |access-date=24 March 2013 |archive-date=26 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226232047/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4250979,00.html |url-status=live|last1=Shauli |first1=Alphi }}</ref> As part of the development plans, the [[Israeli Navy]], which has a large presence in Haifa, will withdraw from the shoreline between Bat Galim and Hof Hashaket. A {{cvt|5|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us|adj=on}} long [[esplanade]] which will encircle the shoreline will be constructed. It will include a bicycle path, and possibly also a small bridge under which navy vessels will pass on their way to the sea.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4312236,00.html |title=Haifa residents invited to 'smash wall' |newspaper=Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |access-date=12 March 2013 |archive-date=7 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307214453/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4312236,00.html |url-status=live|last1=Beno |first1=Goel }}</ref>

Haifa is home to two internationally acclaimed universities and several colleges. The University of Haifa, founded in 1963, is at the top of Mt. Carmel. The campus was designed by the architect of [[Brasília]] and [[United Nations Headquarters]] in New York City, [[Oscar Niemeyer]]. The top floor of the 30-story Eshkol Tower provides a panoramic view of northern Israel. The [[Hecht Museum]], with important archeology and art collections, is on the campus of Haifa University.

The [[Technion|Technion – Israel Institute of Technology]], was founded in 1912, and became the first higher education institution where the language of teaching is Hebrew (see [[War of the Languages]]). It has 18 faculties and 42 [[research institute]]s. The original building now houses [[Israel National Museum of Science, Technology, and Space]], also known as Madatech.

The [[Hebrew Reali School]] was founded in 1913. It is the largest [[k-12]] school in Israel, with 4,000 students in 7 branches, all over the city.

The first technological high school in Israel, Bosmat, was established in Haifa in 1933. It was affiliated with the Technion. Because of financial difficulties, it was closed in 2007, and later re-established as part of the Mofet network, which was started by science teachers from the [[1990s post-Soviet aliyah]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/894017.html |title=The closing of a dream come true |access-date=25 January 2008 |work=Haaretz |archive-date=3 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203085715/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/894017.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

Haifa's [[Bus|intercity bus]] connections are operated almost exclusively by the [[Egged (company)|Egged]] bus company, which operates two terminals:
* [[HaMifratz Central Bus Station]], adjacent to the HaMifrats Central Railway Station
* Haifa Hof HaCarmel Central Bus Station, adjacent to the Hof HaCarmel Railway Station
Lines to the North of the country use HaMifratz Central Bus Station and their coverage includes most towns in the North of Israel. Lines heading south use [[Haifa Hof HaCarmel Central Bus Station]].

Destinations directly reachable from Hof HaCarmel CBS include Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, [[Eilat]], [[Ra'anana|Raanana]], [[Netanya]], [[Hadera]], [[Zikhron Ya'akov]], [[Atlit (modern town)|Atlit]], [[Tirat Carmel]], Ben Gurion International Airport and intermediate communities. There are also three Egged lines that have their terminus in the [[Ramat Vizhnitz]] neighborhood and run to [[Jerusalem]], [[Bnei Brak]] and Ashdod. These used to be "''[[mehadrin bus lines|mehadrin]]''" (i.e. gender segregated) lines.

All urban lines are run by Egged. There are also [[share taxi]]s that run along some bus routes but do not have an official schedule. In 2006, Haifa implemented a trial network of neighborhood mini-buses – named "Shkhunatit" and run by Egged.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1150885952889&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Egged to start minibus project in Haifa |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=9 June 2006 |access-date=22 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718110005/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1150885952889&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |archive-date=18 July 2011}}</ref> In December 2012, [[GetTaxi]], an app and taxi service which allows users to hail a cab using their smartphone without contacting the taxi station (by identifying and summoning the closest taxi) began operating.
