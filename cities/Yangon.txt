==Etymology and pronunciation==
The name ''Yangon'' ({{my|ရန်ကုန်}}) is derived from the combination of the [[Burmese language|Burmese]] words {{lang|my-Latn|yan}} ({{wikt-lang|my|ရန်}}) and {{lang|my-Latn|koun}} ({{wikt-lang|my|ကုန်}}), which mean 'enemies' and 'run out of', respectively. This word combination can be translated as 'End of Strife'.

The name is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|j|æ|ŋ|ˈ|ɡ|ɒ|n}} {{respell|yang|GON}} in British English and {{IPAc-en|ˌ|j|ɑː|n|ˈ|ɡ|oʊ|n}} {{respell|yahn|GOHN}} in American English.<ref>{{cite LPD|3}}</ref>

The former romanization, ''Rangoon'', was based on the [[Rakhine dialect]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/25917223 |title=Burma or Myanmar? Burmese or Burman?

In 1755, King [[Alaungpaya]], the founder of the [[Konbaung dynasty]] captured Dagon, added settlements around it, and called the enlarged town "Yangon".

Colonial Yangon, with its spacious parks and lakes and mix of modern buildings and traditional wooden architecture, was known as "the garden city of the East."<ref name="autogenerated4" /> By the early 20th century, Yangon had public services and infrastructure on par with London.<ref name="arc">{{Cite book |last=Falconer |first=John |year=2001 |title=Burmese Design & Architecture |isbn=978-962-593-882-0 |publisher=Periplus |location=Hong Kong |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Before [[World War II]], about 55% of Yangon's population of 500,000 was [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian]] or [[South Asian]], and only about a third was [[Bamar]] (Burman).<ref name=tmmt>{{Cite book |title=Indian Communities in south-east Asia – Some Aspects of Indians in Rangoon |last=Tin Maung Maung Than |publisher=Institute of south-east Asian Studies |year=1993 |pages=585–587 |isbn=978-981-230-418-6}}</ref> [[Karens]], [[Burmese Chinese|Chinese]], [[Anglo-Burmese]] and others made up the rest.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

After [[World War I]], Yangon became the center of the Burmese independence movement, with leftist Rangoon University students leading the way. Three nationwide strikes against British rule in 1920, 1936, and 1938 all began in Yangon. Yangon was under [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] occupation (1942–45), and incurred heavy damage during World War II. The city was retaken by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in May 1945. Yangon became the capital of the Union of Burma on 4 January 1948 when the country gained independence from British rule.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Grace |first=John D. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M0YfDgAAQBAJ |title=Heads of State and Government |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK |year=2017 |isbn=978-1-349-65771-1 |page=606}}</ref>
=== Contemporary Yangon (1948–present) ===
Soon after Burma's independence in 1948, many colonial-era names of streets and parks were changed to more nationalistic Burmese names. In 1989, the [[State Peace and Development Council|military junta]] changed the city's English name to "Yangon", along with many other changes in English transliteration of Burmese names. (The changes have not been accepted by many Burmese who consider the junta unfit to make such changes, nor by many publications and news bureaus, including, most notably, the [[BBC]] and foreign nations including the United Kingdom and the United States.)<ref>{{cite news |department=Who, What, Why? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7013943.stm |title=Should it be Burma or Myanmar? |work=BBC News |date=26 September 2007 |access-date=17 April 2010 |archive-date=31 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131232458/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7013943.stm |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35910.htm |title=Background Note: Burma |publisher=Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, US Department of State |access-date=1 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170122194342/https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35910.htm |archive-date=22 January 2017 }}</ref>

Since independence, Yangon has expanded outwards. Successive governments have built satellite towns such as [[Thaketa Township|Thaketa]], [[North Okkalapa Township|North Okkalapa]] and [[South Okkalapa Township|South Okkalapa]] in the 1950s to [[Hlaingthaya Township|Hlaingthaya]], [[Shwepyitha Township|Shwepyitha]] and [[South Dagon Township|South Dagon]] in the 1980s.<ref name=mcy/> Today, Greater Yangon encompasses an area covering nearly {{convert|600|km2}}.<ref name=uncrd/>

During [[Ne Win]]'s isolationist rule (1962–88), Yangon's infrastructure deteriorated through poor maintenance and did not keep up with its increasing population. In the 1990s, the military government's more open market policies attracted domestic and foreign investment, bringing a modicum of modernity to the city's infrastructure. Some inner city residents were forcibly relocated to new satellite towns. Many colonial-period buildings were demolished to make way for high-rise hotels, office buildings, and shopping malls,<ref name="beyondrangoon">{{cite magazine |title=Beyond Rangoon |url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=5745&page=3 |date=1 May 2006 |author=Edward Blair |magazine=The Irrawaddy |access-date=30 August 2008 |archive-date=4 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101004130347/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=5745&page=3 }}</ref> leading the city government to place about 200 notable colonial-period buildings under the [[Yangon City Heritage List]] in 1996.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Special Report |url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/myanmartimes/no87/New/14.htm |date=4 November 2001 |access-date=30 August 2008 |archive-date=22 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822213342/http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/myanmartimes/no87/New/14.htm }}</ref> Major building programs have resulted in six new bridges and five new highways linking the city to its industrial back country.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes17-333/b006.htm |title=Pioneering FMI City 'the best in Yangon' |author=Zaw Htet |work=The Myanmar Times |access-date=7 September 2008 |archive-date=14 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114013535/http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes17-333/b006.htm }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cemm/eng/zt/zmjjqd/jmgxgk/t198979.htm |title=Yangon-Thanlyin Bridge |access-date=7 September 2008}}{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}</ref><ref name="ngamoeyeik">{{Cite news |url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp2001/2-2001/nga.htm |title=Ngamoeyeik Bridge |author=Kyi Kyi Hla |date=1 February 2001 |access-date=7 September 2008 |archive-date=19 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119074811/http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp2001/2-2001/nga.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> Still, much of Yangon remains without basic municipal services such as 24-hour electricity and regular garbage collection.

Yangon has become much more indigenous Burmese in its ethnic make-up since independence. After independence, many South Asians and Anglo-Burmese left. Many more South Asians were forced to leave during the 1960s by Ne Win's xenophobic government.<ref name=tmmt/> Nevertheless, sizeable South Asian and Chinese communities still exist in Yangon. The Anglo-Burmese have effectively disappeared, having left the country or intermarried with other Burmese groups.

Yangon was the centre of major anti-government protests in [[U Thant funeral crisis|1974]], [[8888 Uprising|1988]] and [[Saffron Revolution|2007]].

It is primarily due to the heavy rainfall received during the rainy season that makes Yangon fall under the tropical monsoon climate category. During the course of year 1961 to 1990s, average temperatures show little variance, with average highs ranging from {{cvt|29|to|36|C|F}} and average lows ranging from {{cvt|18|to|25|C|F}}.

Yangon is prone to [[tropical cyclones]] every time of the year. In 2008, [[Cyclone Nargis]] made landfall as a Category 4 cyclone, making it the worst cyclone on the country's record.

Until the mid-1990s, Yangon remained largely constrained to its traditional peninsula setting between the [[Bago River|Bago]], Yangon, and [[Hlaing River]]s. People moved in, but little of the city moved out. Maps from 1944 show little development north of [[Inya Lake]] and areas that are now layered in cement and stacked with houses were then virtual backwaters. Since the late 1980s, however, the city began a rapid spread north to where [[Yangon International Airport]] now stands. But the result is a stretching tail on the city, with the downtown area well removed from its geographic centre.<ref name="future-yangon">{{Cite journal |title=The Future of Yangon |url=http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes17-325/b008.htm |date=16 July 2006 |author=May Thanda Win |journal=The Myanmar Times |access-date=5 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121094338/http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes17-325/b008.htm |archive-date=21 November 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The city's area has steadily increased from {{convert|72.52|km2|sqmi}} in 1901 to {{convert|86.2|km2|sqmi}} in 1940 to {{convert|208.51|km2|sqmi}} in 1974, to {{convert|346.13|km2|sqmi}} in 1985, and to {{convert|598.75|km2|sqmi}} in 2008.<ref name=uncrd>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uncrd.or.jp/env/3rd-regional-est-forum/doc/23_Myanmar.pdf |title=Third Regional EST Forum: Presentation of Myanmar |publisher=Ministry of Transport, Myanmar |location=Singapore |date=17–19 March 2008 |access-date=19 January 2009 |archive-date=26 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226114154/http://www.uncrd.or.jp/env/3rd-regional-est-forum/doc/23_Myanmar.pdf }}</ref><ref name=mcy-znm>{{Cite book |title=Megacity yangon: transformation processes and modern developments |author=Zin Nwe Myint |isbn=978-3-8258-0042-0 |editor1=Frauke Krass |editor2=Hartmut Gaese |editor3=Mi Mi Kyi |page=264 |publisher=Lit Verlag |location=Berlin |year=2006}}</ref>

A latter-day hallmark of Yangon is the eight-story [[apartment building]]. (In Yangon parlance, a building with no [[elevator]]s (lifts) is called an apartment building and one with elevators is called a [[Condominium (living space)|condominium]].<ref>{{Cite journal |title=City living: condos vs apartments |url=http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/Construction/con13.htm |date=1 September 2007 |journal=The Myanmar Times |access-date=12 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720094137/http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/Construction/con13.htm |archive-date=20 July 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Condos which have to invest in a local power generator to ensure 24-hour electricity for the elevators are beyond the reach of most Yangonites.) Found throughout the city, eight-story apartment buildings provide inexpensive housing for many Yangonites. The apartments are usually eight stories high (including the ground floor) mainly because city regulations, until February 2008, required that all buildings higher than {{convert|75|ft|m}} or eight stories to install lifts.<ref name=lift>{{Cite news |title=Lift regulation changed |url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no409/n013.htm |date=10 March 2008 |author=Yi Yi Htwe |work=The Myanmar Times |access-date=1 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216085020/http://mmtimes.com/no409/n013.htm |archive-date=16 December 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The code calls for elevators in buildings higher than {{convert|62|ft|m}} or six stories, likely ushering in the era of the six-story apartment building. Although most apartment buildings were built only within the last 20 years, they look much older and rundown due to shoddy construction and lack of proper maintenance.

Unlike other major Asian cities, Yangon does not have any skyscrapers. This is due to rule that no building should be more than 75% the height above sea level of [[Shwedagon Pagoda]], which rises about {{convert|160|m}}. For instance, in 2015, a luxury housing project was cancelled due to its proximity to Shwedagon Pagoda. Critics of the project claimed that the project could cause structural damage to the pagoda.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tha |first=Kyaw Phyo |date=2016-02-08 |title=Once-Cancelled Dagon City 1 Project Relocated to New Site |url=https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/once-cancelled-dagon-city-1-project-relocated-to-new-site.html |access-date=2023-08-22 |website=The Irrawaddy |language=en-US |archive-date=22 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230822092110/https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/once-cancelled-dagon-city-1-project-relocated-to-new-site.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Aside from a few high-rise hotels and office towers, most high-rise buildings (usually 10 stories and up) are "condos" scattered across prosperous neighborhoods north of downtown such as [[Bahan Township|Bahan]], [[Dagon Township|Dagon]], [[Kamayut Township|Kamayut]] and [[Mayangon Township|Mayangon]].

Older satellite towns such as [[Thaketa Township|Thaketa]], [[North Okkalapa Township|North Okkalapa]], and [[South Okkalapa Township|South Okkalapa]] are lined mostly with one to two-story detached houses with access to the city's electricity grid. Newer satellite towns such as [[North Dagon Township|North Dagon]] and [[South Dagon Township|South Dagon]] are in a grid layout. The satellite towns—old or new—receive little or no municipal services.

===Road layout===
[[File:Ministers' Office Building Yangon 4.jpg|thumb|Yangon Secretariat Office]]
[[Downtown Yangon]]'s road layout follows a grid pattern, based on four types of roads:
* Broad 49-m wide roads running west to east
* Broad 30-m wide roads running south to north
* Two narrow 9.1-m wide streets running south to north
* Mid-size 15-m wide streets running south to north

The east–west grid of central was laid out by British military engineers Fraser and Montgomerie after the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]].<ref name="arc"/> The city was later developed by the Public Works Department and Bengal Corps of Engineers. The pattern of south to north roads is as follows: one broad {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} wide broad road, two narrow streets, one mid-size street, two more narrow streets, and then another {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} wide broad road. This order is repeated from west to east. The narrow streets are numbered; the medium and broad roads are named.

For example, the {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} Lanmadaw Road is followed by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}}-wide 17th and 18th streets then the medium {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} Sint-Oh-Dan Road, the 30-foot 19th and 20th streets, followed by another {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} wide Latha Road, followed again by the two numbered small roads 21st and 22nd streets, and so on.

The roads running parallel west to east were the Strand Road, Merchant Road, Maha Bandula (née Dalhousie) Road, Anawrahta (Fraser) Road, and Bogyoke Aung San (Montgomerie) Road.

===Parks and gardens===
The largest and best maintained parks in Yangon are located around [[Shwedagon Pagoda]]. To the south-east of the gilded stupa is the most popular recreational area in the city – [[Kandawgyi Lake]]. The 150-acre (61-ha) lake is surrounded by the 110-acre (45-ha) [[Kandawgyi Nature Park]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-travel/myanmar-yangon/kandawgyi-garden.htm |title=Kandawgyi Garden |access-date=21 December 2006 |archive-date=23 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923195453/http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-travel/myanmar-yangon/kandawgyi-garden.htm }}</ref> and the 69.25-acre (28-ha) [[Yangon Zoological Gardens]], which consists of a zoo, an aquarium and an amusement park.<ref name="yz">{{cite web |url=http://www.yangonzoo.com/profile.html |title=History of Zoological Gardens (Yangon) |access-date=27 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802013535/http://www.yangonzoo.com/profile.html |archive-date=2 August 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> West of the pagoda towards the former Hluttaw (Parliament) complex is the 130-acre (53-ha) [[People's Square and Park]], the former parading ground on important national days when Yangon was the capital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://myanmargeneva.org/basicfacts/cap.htm |title=Nation's Capital Yangon |access-date=9 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714132014/http://www.myanmargeneva.org/basicfacts/cap.htm |archive-date=14 July 2009 }}</ref> A few miles north of the pagoda lies the 37-acre (15-ha) [[Inya Lake|Inya Lake Park]] – a favourite hangout place of [[Yangon University]] students, and a well-known place of romance in Burmese popular culture.

[[Hlawga National Park]] and [[Taukkyan War Cemetery|Allied War Memorial]] at the outskirts of the city are popular day-trip destinations with tourists.

==Administration==
Yangon is administered by the [[Yangon City Development Committee]] (YCDC). YCDC also coordinates [[urban planning]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chijihon.metro.tokyo.jp/asianet/participating_cities/yangon.htm |title=Yangon |access-date=13 August 2006 |publisher=Asian Network of Major Cities 21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620010837/http://www.chijihon.metro.tokyo.jp/asianet/participating_cities/yangon.htm |archive-date=20 June 2006}}</ref> The city is made up of 33 townships and is part of [[Yangon Region]].

Yangon is a member of the [[Asian Network of Major Cities 21]].

==Transport==
Yangon is Burma's main domestic and international hub for air, rail, and ground transportation.

===Air===

[[File:Ygnbusyairport.jpg|thumb |Inside T2, [[Yangon International Airport]]]]
[[Yangon International Airport]], located 12&nbsp;miles (19&nbsp;km) from the center, is the country's main gateway for domestic and international air travel. The airport has three terminals, known as T1, T2 and T3 which is also known as Domestic. It has direct flights to major cities in Asia, such as [[Tokyo]], [[Shanghai]], [[Seoul]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Kolkata]], and [[Dubai]]. Although domestic airlines offer service to about forty domestic locations, most flights are to tourist destinations such as [[Bagan]], [[Mandalay]], [[Heho]] and [[Ngapali]], and to the capital [[Naypyidaw]].

===Railways===
[[File:Myanmar-Yangon-Main train station.jpg|thumb|[[Yangon Central Railway Station]]]]
[[Yangon Central Railway Station]] is the main terminus of [[Myanmar Railways]]' {{convert|5403|km|mi|0|adj=on}} rail network<ref name=nlm-rail>{{cite news |title=MR to link Mandalay and Bhamo |date=22 February 2010 |newspaper=New Light of Myanmar}}</ref> whose reach covers Upper Myanmar ([[Naypyidaw]], [[Mandalay]], [[Shwebo]]), upcountry ([[Myitkyina]]), Shan hills ([[Taunggyi]], [[Lashio]]) and the Taninthayi coast ([[Mawlamyine]], [[Dawei]]).

[[Yangon Circular Railway]] operates a {{convert|45.9|km|mi|adj=on}} 39-station commuter rail network that connects Yangon's satellite towns. The system is heavily used by the local populace, selling about 150,000 tickets daily.<ref name="railway bazzar">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/multimedia.php?art_id=10074 |title=The Railway Bazaar |date=30 January 2008 |author=Yeni |magazine=The Irrawaddy |access-date=23 February 2008 |archive-date=8 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208202549/http://www.irrawaddy.org/multimedia.php?art_id=10074 }}</ref> The popularity of the commuter line has jumped since the government reduced petrol subsidies in August 2007.<ref name="railway bazzar"/>

In 2017 the government of Japan provided more than US$200&nbsp;million in finance to assist with a range of works including developing and maintaining the Yangon circular railway line, purchasing new carriages and upgrading signalling.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mmtimes.com/business/21362-myanma-railways-to-upgrade-yangon-circle-line-with-japanese-loan.html |title=Myanma Railways to upgrade circle line with Japanese loan |date=2016-07-13 |website=The Myanmar Times |language=en |access-date=2019-10-26 |archive-date=26 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191026063242/https://www.mmtimes.com/business/21362-myanma-railways-to-upgrade-yangon-circle-line-with-japanese-loan.html }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.moi.gov.mm/moi:eng/?q=news/13/11/2018/id-5139 |title=Ministry of Information (Myanmar) |access-date=26 October 2019 |archive-date=15 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200615232746/https://www.moi.gov.mm/moi:eng/?q=news/13/11/2018/id-5139 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Rapid transit===
The [[Yangon Urban Mass Rapid Transit]] is a proposed [[rapid transit]] system, due to begin construction in 2022 and be complete by 2027.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mmtimes.com/news/mayangone-residents-oppose-transit-project.html |title=Mayangone residents oppose transit project |website=Myanmar Times |date=14 January 2020 |access-date=14 January 2020 |archive-date=14 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114154221/https://www.mmtimes.com/news/mayangone-residents-oppose-transit-project.html }}</ref>

===Buses and cars===

Yangon has a {{convert|4456|km|mi|adj=on}} road network of all types (tar, concrete and dirt) in March 2011. Many of the roads are in poor condition and not wide enough to accommodate an increasing number of cars.<ref name=w11-30yr-plan/> The vast majority of Yangon residents cannot afford a car and rely on an extensive network of buses to get around.

Motor transportation in Yangon is highly expensive for most of its citizens.

Within Yangon city limits, it is illegal to drive [[trishaw]]s, bicycles, and motorcycles. Since February 2010, [[pick-up truck]] bus lines have been forbidden to run in six townships of central Yangon, namely [[Latha Township|Latha]], [[Lanmadaw Township|Lanmadaw]], [[Pabedan Township|Pabedan]], [[Kyauktada Township|Kyauktada]], [[Botahtaung Township|Botahtaung]] and [[Pazundaung Township]]s.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2010/news/511/n51106.html |title=Authorities ban light truck buses in downtown areas |author=Nay Nwe Moe Aung |work=Myanmar Times |date=24 February 2010 |access-date=18 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716143017/http://mmtimes.com/2010/news/511/n51106.html |archive-date=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In May 2003, a ban on using car horns was implemented in six townships of Downtown Yangon to reduce [[noise pollution]].<ref name="symo">{{cite news |url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no396/n008.htm |title=Vehicle horn penalties increased |author=Shwe Yinn Mar Oo |date=10 December 2007 |work=Myanmar Times |access-date=18 August 2011 |archive-date=23 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123011522/http://www.mmtimes.com/no396/n008.htm }}</ref> In April 2004, the car horn ban was expanded to cover the entire city.<ref name="symo"/>

Yangon is the most populous city by far in Myanmar. According to the 2014 census, the city had a population of 5.16&nbsp;million.<ref name=census-2014-18>{{cite book |title=Census Report |publisher=Ministry of Immigration and Population |location=Naypyitaw |date=May 2015 |series=The 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census |volume=2 |page=18 |url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B067GBtstE5TeUlIVjRjSjVzWlk/view |access-date=22 September 2016 |archive-date=7 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190507224807/https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B067GBtstE5TeUlIVjRjSjVzWlk/view |url-status=live}}</ref> The city's population grew sharply after 1948 as many people (mainly, the indigenous Burmese) from other parts of the country moved into the newly built satellite towns of North Okkalapa, South Okkalapa, and Thaketa in the 1950s and East Dagon, North Dagon and South Dagon in the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} Immigrants have founded their regional associations (such as Mandalay Association, Mawlamyaing Association, etc.) in Yangon for networking purposes. The government's decision to move the nation's administrative capital to Naypyidaw has drained an unknown number of civil servants away from Yangon.

Yangon is the most ethnically diverse city in the country. While [[Burmese Indians|Indians]] formed the slight majority prior to World War II,<ref name=tmmt/> today, the majority of the population is of indigenous [[Bamar]] (Burman) descent. Large communities of Indians Burmese and the [[Chinese people in Burma|Chinese Burmese]] exist, especially in the traditional downtown neighborhoods. A large number of [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]] and [[Karen people|Karen]] also live in the city.

[[Burmese language|Burmese]] is the principal language of the city. English is by far the preferred second language of the educated class. In recent years, however, the prospect of overseas job opportunities has enticed some to study other languages: [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] is most popular, followed by Japanese, and French.<ref name=lang>{{Cite news |title=Language training centres open doors to new worlds |url=http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/edu/edu002.htm |date=14 May 2007 |author1=Kyaw Soe Linn |author2=Phyo Wai Kyaw |name-list-style=amp |work=The Myanmar Times |access-date=1 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720094651/http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/edu/edu002.htm |archive-date=20 July 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Religions===
The primary religions practised in Yangon are [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], and [[Hinduism]]. Shwedagon Pagoda is a famous religious landmark in the city.

===Media===

Yangon is the country's hub for the movie, music, advertising, newspaper, and book publishing industries, and is the country's cultural center. All media is heavily regulated by the military government. Television broadcasting is off-limits to the private sector. All media content must first be approved by the government's media censor board, [[Press Scrutiny and Registration Division]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=10648 |title=Burma: The Censored Land |date=1 March 2008 |author=Yeni |magazine=The Irrawaddy |access-date=20 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311223612/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=10648 |archive-date=11 March 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Most television channels in the country are broadcast from Yangon. [[MRTV (TV network)|MRTV]] and [[Myawaddy TV]] are the two main channels, providing Burmese-language news and entertainment programs. Other special interest channels are MWD-1 and MWD-2, [[Myanmar International|MITV]], the English-language channel that targets overseas audiences via satellite and via internet, [[MRTV-4]] and Channel 7 (Yangon) are with a focus on non-formal education programs and movies, and Movie 5, a pay-TV channel specializing in broadcasting foreign movies.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Digital television take-up slower than expected |url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no429/b004.htm |date=3 August 2008 |author=Kyaw Hsu Mon |work=The Myanmar Times |access-date=8 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430045926/http://www.mmtimes.com/no429/b004.htm |archive-date=30 April 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Yangon has three radio stations. [[Myanmar Radio]] is the national radio service and broadcasts mostly in Burmese and in English during specific times. Pop culture-oriented [[Yangon City FM]] and [[Mandalay City FM]] radio stations specialize in Burmese and English pop music, entertainment programs, live celebrity interviews, etc. New radio channels such as Shwe FM and Pyinsawaddy FM can also be tuned with the city area.

Nearly all print media and industries are based out of Yangon. All three national newspapers – two Burmese language dailies ''[[The New Light of Myanmar|Myanma Alin]]'' ({{my|မြန်မာ့အလင်း}}) and ''[[Kyemon]]'' ({{my|ကြေးမုံ}}), and the English language ''[[The New Light of Myanmar]]'' – are published by the government. Semi-governmental ''[[The Myanmar Times]]'' weekly, published in Burmese and in English, is mainly geared for Yangon's expatriate community. There are over 20 special interest journals and magazines covering sports, fashion, finance, crime, and literature (but never politics).

Access to foreign media is extremely difficult. Satellite television in Yangon, and in Burma, is very expensive as the government imposes an annual registration fee of [[burmese kyat|Ks.]]10,00,000/-, equivalent to around U$600/year.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Certain foreign newspapers and periodicals such as the ''[[Straits Times]]'' can be found only in a few (mostly downtown) bookstores. Internet access in Yangon, which has the best telecommunication infrastructure in the country, is slow and erratic at best, and the Burmese government implements one of the world's most restrictive regimes of internet control.<ref name="oni">{{cite web |url=http://opennet.net/studies/burma |title=Internet Filtering in Burma in 2005: A Country Study |date=1 October 2005 |access-date=29 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905203458/http://www.opennet.net/studies/burma/ |archive-date=5 September 2008 }}</ref> International text messaging and voice messaging was permitted only in August 2008.<ref name="sms">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=13962 |title=International Text Messaging Approved in Burma |author=Min Lwin |date=21 August 2008 |magazine=The Irrawaddy |access-date=30 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811233000/http://irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=13962 |archive-date=11 August 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Yangon's property market is the most expensive in the country and beyond the reach of most Yangonites. Most rent outside the centre and few can afford to rent such apartments. (In 2008, rents for a typical {{convert|650|to|750|sqft|m2|adj=on}} apartments in the centre and vicinity range between K70,000 and K150,000 and those for high end condos between K200,000 and K500,000.)<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no427/b006.htm |title=Rentals brisk in lead up to Waso |date=14 July 2008 |author=Aye Sabae Phyu |work=The Myanmar Times |access-date=6 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430045857/http://www.mmtimes.com/no427/b006.htm |archive-date=30 April 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Yangon is home to [[pagoda festival]]s (''paya pwe''), held during dry-season months (November – March). The most famous of all, the Shwedagon Pagoda Festival in March, attracts thousands of pilgrims from around the country.

[[List of museums in Yangon|Yangon's museums]] are the domain of tourists and rarely visited by the locals.

Most of Yangon's larger hotels offer nightlife entertainment, geared towards tourists and the well-to-do Burmese. Some hotels offer traditional Burmese performing arts shows complete with a traditional Burmese orchestra. The pub scene in larger hotels is more or less the same as elsewhere in Asia. Other options include karaoke bars and pub restaurants in Yangon [[Chinatown]].

==Sports==
[[File:Home of Asian Lions.jpg|thumb|[[Thuwunna Stadium]]]]
As the city has the best sporting facilities in the country, most national-level annual sporting tournaments such as track and field, football, volleyball, tennis and swimming are held in Yangon. The 40,000-seat [[Aung San Stadium]] and the 32,000-seat [[Thuwunna Stadium]] are the main venues for the popular annual State and Division football tournament. Until April 2009, the now-defunct [[Myanmar Premier League]], consisted of 16 Yangon-based clubs,<ref>{{Cite news |title=Myanmar edges towards pro football |url=http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes14-277/sport.htm |date=1 August 2005 |work=The Myanmar Times |author=Zaw Htet |access-date=27 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514035649/http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes14-277/sport.htm |archive-date=14 May 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> played all its matches in Yangon stadiums, and attracted little interest from the general public or commercial success despite the enormous popularity of football in Burma. Most Yangonites prefer watching European football on satellite TV. Teams such as Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, and Manchester City are among the favorite European teams among the Yangonites. It remains to be seen whether the [[Myanmar National League]], the country's first professional football league, and its Yangon-based club [[Yangon United FC]] will attract a sufficient following in the country's most important media market.

Yangon is also home to annual the Myanmar Open golf tournament, and the Myanmar Open tennis tournament. The city hosted the 1961 and 1969 [[South East Asian Games]]. During colonial times, [[cricket]] was played mostly by British officials in the city. [[First-class cricket]] was played in the city in January 1927 when the touring [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] played [[Burma national cricket team|Burma]] and the [[Rangoon Gymkhana cricket team|Rangoon Gymkhana]]. Two grounds were used to host these matches, the [[BAA Ground]] and the [[Gymkhana Ground, Rangoon|Gymkhana Ground]].<ref>{{citation |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/44/250.html |title=BAA Ground |publisher=CricketArchive.com |access-date=2 November 2017 |archive-date=15 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215014127/https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/44/250.html |url-status=live}} Retrieved on 8 October 2011</ref><ref>{{citation |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/44/251.html |title=Gymkhana Ground |publisher=CricketArchive.com |access-date=2 November 2017 |archive-date=15 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215053501/https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/44/251.html |url-status=live}} Retrieved on 8 October 2011</ref> These matches mark the only time Burma and Rangoon Gymkhana have appeared in first-class cricket, and the only time first-class cricket has been played in Burma.

Yangon has a growing population of skateboarders, as documented in the films Altered Focus: Burma and Youth of Yangon. German non-profit organization [[Make Life Skate Life]] has received permission from the [[Yangon City Development Committee]] to construct a concrete skatepark at [[Thakin Mya]] park in downtown. The park was completed in 2015 and is available free of charge to anyone in the city.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.makelifeskatelife.org/myanmar |title=Myanmar |access-date=14 May 2021 |archive-date=14 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210514004640/https://www.makelifeskatelife.org/myanmar |url-status=live}}</ref>

Yangon is the country's main center for trade, industry, real estate, media, entertainment and tourism. The city represents about one fifth of the [[Gross domestic product|national economy]]. According to official statistics for [[Fiscal year|FY]] 2010–2011, the size of the economy of Yangon Region was 8.93&nbsp;trillion kyats, or 23% of the national GDP.<ref name=mt->{{cite news |title=Yangon Region govt facing K22b budget black hole |url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2011/news/600/news60002.html |author1=Kyaw Hsu Mon |author2=Yadana Htun |name-list-style=amp |date=7 November 2011 |work=The Myanmar Times |access-date=9 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617115438/http://www.mmtimes.com/2011/news/600/news60002.html |archive-date=17 June 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The city is Lower Burma's main trading hub for all kinds of merchandise – from basic foodstuffs to used cars although commerce continues to be hampered by the city's severely underdeveloped banking industry and communication infrastructure.

There are over 20 universities and colleges in the city. While [[Yangon University]] remains the best known (its main campus is a part of popular Burmese culture e.g. literature, music, film, etc.), the nation's oldest university is now mostly a graduate school, deprived of undergraduate studies. Following the 1988 nationwide uprising, the military government has repeatedly closed universities, and has dispersed most of the undergraduate student population to new universities in the suburbs such as [[Dagon University]], the [[University of East Yangon]] and the [[University of West Yangon]]. Nonetheless, many of the country's most selective universities are still in Yangon. Students from around the country still have to come to study in Yangon as some subjects are offered only at its universities. The [[University of Medicine 1, Yangon|University of Medicine 1]], [[University of Medicine 2, Yangon|University of Medicine 2]], [[Yangon Technological University]], [[University of Computer Studies, Yangon|University of Computer Studies]] and [[Myanmar Maritime University]] are the most selective in the country.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/edu08/e001.htm |title=HR key to development |date=28 March 2008 |author=Minh Zaw |work=The Myanmar Times |access-date=23 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720031121/http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/edu08/e001.htm |archive-date=20 July 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Health care==
{{See also|List of hospitals in Yangon}}
[[File:General Hospital, Yangon.jpg|thumb|Yangon General Hospital]]
The general state of health care in Yangon is poor. According to a 2007 estimate, the military government spends 0.4% of the national budget on health care, and 40% to 60% on defence.<ref name=dumber/> By the government's own figures, it spends 849 kyats (US$0.85) per person.<ref name=malpractice>{{cite magazine |title=Another Medical Malpractice Death in Rangoon |url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=17547 |author=Arkar Moe |magazine=The Irrawaddy |date=8 January 2010 |access-date=18 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112075354/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=17547 |archive-date=12 January 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals including the flagship [[Yangon General Hospital]] lack many of the basic facilities and equipment.

Wealthier Yangonites still have access to country's best medical facilities and internationally qualified doctors. Only Yangon and [[Mandalay]] have any sizeable number of doctors left as many Burmese doctors have emigrated. The well-to-do go to private clinics or hospitals like Pun Hlaing International Hospital and Bahosi Medical Clinic.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pun Hlaing International Hospital Ltd. - Healthcare Company in Yangon - InvestMyanmar.biz |url=http://www.investmyanmar.biz/infoCompany.php?id=7460 |website=www.investmyanmar.biz |access-date=26 January 2020 |archive-date=15 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200615194728/http://www.investmyanmar.biz/infoCompany.php?id=7460 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[Medical malpractice]] is widespread, even in private clinics and hospitals that serve the well-to-do. In 2009 and 2010, a spate of high-profile deaths<ref name=malpractice/> brought out the severity of the problem, even for the relatively well off Yangonites. The wealthy do not rely on domestic hospitals and travel abroad, usually [[Bangkok]] or Singapore, for treatment.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/health/h012.htm |title=Medical tourism gives patients options |author=Thein Win Nyo |work=The Myanmar Times |date=11 June 2007 |access-date=1 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720093301/https://www.mmtimes.com/feature/health/h012.htm |archive-date=20 July 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>
