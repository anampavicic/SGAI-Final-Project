==Economy==
Ceyhan's marine transport terminal is the Mediterranean terminus of the [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline]] (the "BTC") which brings [[petroleum|crude oil]] from the landlocked [[Caspian Sea]] across [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and entering Turkey in the northeast. The pipeline was completed in May 2005. The terminal contains seven storage tanks, a jetty capable of loading two [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]]s of up to {{DWT|300,000|metric|disp=long}} simultaneously, metering facilities, a [[Industrial wastewater treatment|waste water treatment plant]] and vapor [[incineration]] ("burn-off") facilities.

Ceyhan Terminal is also the destination of [[Kirkuk–Ceyhan Oil Pipeline]] but this was closed in 2024 due to a payment dispute.<ref name="v260">{{cite web | author=Gary Dixon (g_dixon) | title=No way out: ‘Hormuz closure would rock tanker markets’, says BRS | website=TradeWinds | date=2024-10-08 | url=https://www.tradewindsnews.com/tankers/no-way-out-hormuz-closure-would-rock-tanker-markets-says-brs/2-1-1721116?zephr_sso_ott=8tfeAp | access-date=2024-10-10}}</ref>
