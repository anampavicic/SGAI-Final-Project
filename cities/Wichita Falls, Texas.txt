'''Wichita Falls''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɪ|tʃ|ɪ|t|aː}} {{respell|WITCH|i|tah}}) is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Wichita County, Texas]], [[United States]].<ref name="GR6">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|access-date=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> It is the principal city of the [[Wichita Falls metropolitan area|Wichita Falls metropolitan statistical area]], which encompasses all of [[Archer County, Texas|Archer]], [[Clay County, Texas|Clay]], and Wichita Counties. According to the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]], it had a population of 102,316,<ref>{{Cite web |title=U.S. Census Bureau Quickfacts: Wichita Falls city, Texas |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/wichitafallscitytexas/PST045222|access-date=2024-01-03}}</ref> making it the [[List of municipalities in Texas|43rd-most populous]] city in Texas.

The city was named, in 1876, for a waterfall on the [[Wichita River]], which was destroyed due to flooding in 1886.

The city is home to the [[Newby-McMahon Building]] (otherwise known as the "[[world's littlest skyscraper]]"), constructed downtown in 1919 and featured in [[Robert Ripley]]'s ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]''.

The [[Choctaw]] Native Americans settled the area in the early 1800s from their native Mississippi area once Americans displaced them after the [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://wichita-falls-texas.com/history/|title=Wichita Falls History |work=WichitaFallsTexas.com|access-date=October 4, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905112801/http://wichita-falls-texas.com/history/|archive-date=September 5, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> The treaty was signed and proclaimed in 1830–1831. As late as 1841, a large Indian settlement was present in the area that is now the city of Wichita Falls.<ref name=TSHA />

American settlers arrived in the 1860s, mainly as cattle ranchers. The city was named Wichita Falls on September 27, 1876, as the Wichita River runs through the area and a waterfall was in the river's course in 1876. Just 10 years later in 1886, a flood destroyed the original [[waterfall]] on the [[Wichita River]] for which the city was named.<ref name=TSHA>{{cite web |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/rnw06 |title=Wichita River |work=Handbook of Texas Online |access-date=April 12, 2013 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo16678 |title=Assessment of Channel Changes, Models of Historical Floods and Effects of Backwater on Flood Stage, and Flood Mitigation Alternatives for the Wichita River at Wichita Falls, Texas |work=[[United States Geological Survey]] Scientific Investigations Report 2011–5175 |first1=Karl E. |last1=Winters |first2=Stanley |last2=Baldys III |year=2011 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Wichita Falls - Time Line |url=https://www.wichitafallstx.gov/DocumentCenter/View/19742/Wichita-Falls-Time-Line-1872-1993?bidId= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231101155345/https://www.wichitafallstx.gov/DocumentCenter/View/19742/Wichita-Falls-Time-Line-1872-1993?bidId= |archive-date=2023-11-01 |access-date=2023-11-01 |website=wichitafallstx.gov}}</ref> After nearly 100 years of visitors wanting to visit the no longer existing falls, the city built an [[artificial waterfall]] beside the river in Lucy Park.

The early history of Wichita Falls well into the 20th century also rests on the work of two entrepreneurs, Joseph A.

Downtown Wichita Falls was the city's main shopping area for many years. Those shops lost ground to the creation of new shopping centers throughout the city beginning with Parker Square in 1953 and other similar developments during the 1960s and 1970s, culminating with the opening of [[Sikes Senter]] Mall in 1974. The city has been seeking funding to rebuild and restore the downtown area since 2010.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Wichita Falls was once home to offices of several oil companies and related industries, along with oil refineries operated by the [[Continental Oil Company]] (now [[ConocoPhillips]]) until 1952 and Panhandle Oil Company (founded in Wichita Falls, sold to [[Petrofina|American Petrofina]] in 1965).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.totalpetrochemicalsrefiningusa.com/who_we_are/history.asp|title=Who We Are}}</ref> Both firms continued to use a portion of their former refineries as gasoline/oil terminal facilities for many years.

An F4 tornado struck the heavily populated southern sections of Wichita Falls in the late afternoon on Tuesday, April 10, 1979 (known as "Terrible Tuesday"). It was part of an outbreak that produced 30 tornadoes around the region. Despite having nearly an hour's advance warning that [[severe weather]] was imminent, 42 people were killed (including 25 in vehicles) and 1,800 were injured because it arrived just as many people were driving home from work.<ref>{{cite web|title=Synopsis and Discussion of the 10 April 1979 Tornado Outbreak|publisher=National Weather Service Norman, Oklahoma|date=January 19, 2010|url=http://www.weather.gov/oun/events-19790410-burgess|access-date=March 14, 2011}}</ref> It left 20,000 people homeless and caused $400 million in damage, a U.S. record not topped by an individual tornado until the F5 [[1999 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado|Moore–Oklahoma City tornado]] of May 3, 1999.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Great Plains Tornado Outbreak of May 3-4, 1999 |work=National Weather Service |location=Norman, Oklahoma |date=November 20, 2009 |url=http://www.weather.gov/oun/events-19990503|access-date=December 4, 2009}}</ref>

Wichita Falls experiences a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''), featuring long, very hot and humid summers, and cool winters. The city has some of the highest summer daily maximum temperatures in the entire U.S. outside of the [[Southwest United States|Desert Southwest]]. Temperatures have hit {{convert|100|°F|0}} as early as March 27 and as late as October 17, but more typically reach that level on 28 days annually, with 102 days of {{convert|90|°F|0}} or higher annually; the average window for the latter mark is April 9–October 10. However, 59 to 60 nights of freezing lows occur, and an average of 4.8 days where the high does not rise above freezing. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from {{convert|42.0|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|84.4|°F|1}} in July. The record low temperature is {{convert|−12|°F|0}} on January 4, 1947.

Lucy Park is a {{convert|170|acre|ha|adj=on}} park with a log cabin, duck pond, swimming pool, playground, [[frisbee golf]] course, and picnic areas.

It is one of 37 parks throughout the city. The parks range in size from small neighborhood facilities to the 258 acres of Weeks Park featuring the Champions Course at Weeks Park, an 18-hole golf course.

Wichita Falls is the western terminus for [[Interstate 44 in Texas|Interstate 44]]. [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. Highways]] leading to or through Wichita Falls include [[U.S. Route 287 in Texas|287]], [[U.S. Route 277 in Texas|277]], [[U.S. Route 281 in Texas|281]], and [[U.S. Route 82 in Texas|82]]. [[State Highway 240 (Texas)|State Highway 240]] ends at Wichita Falls and [[State Highway 79 (Texas)|State Highway 79]] runs through it. Wichita Falls has one of the largest freeway mileages for a city of its size{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} as a result of a 1954 bond issue approved by city and county voters to purchase rights-of-way for several expressway routes through the city and county, the first of which was opened in the year 1958 as an alignment of U.S. 287 from Eighth Street at Broad and Holliday Streets northwestward across the Wichita River and bisecting Lucy and Scotland Parks to the Old Iowa Park Road, the original U.S. 287 alignment.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} That was followed by other expressway links including U.S. 82–287 east to [[Henrietta, Texas|Henrietta]] (completed in the year 1968), U.S. 281 south toward [[Jacksboro, Texas|Jacksboro]] (completed 1969), U.S. 287 northwest to [[Iowa Park, Texas|Iowa Park]] and [[Electra, Texas|Electra]] (opened 1962), Interstate 44 north to [[Burkburnett, Texas|Burkburnett]] and the Red River (opened 1964), and Interstate 44 from Old Iowa Park Road to U.S. 287/Spur 325 interchange on the city's north side along with Spur 325 from I-44/U.S. 287 to the main gate of Sheppard Air Force Base (both completed as a single project in 1960). However, cross-country traffic for many years had to contend with several ground-level intersections and traffic lights over Holliday and Broad Streets near the downtown area for about 13 blocks between connecting expressway links until a new elevated freeway running overhead was completed in 2001.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Efforts to create an additional freeway along the path of Kell Boulevard for U.S. 82–277 began in 1967 with the acquisition of right-of-way that included a former railroad right-of-way and the first project including construction of the present frontage roads completed in 1977, followed by freeway lanes, overpasses, and on/off ramps in 1989 from just east of Brook Avenue west to Kemp Boulevard; similar projects west from Kemp to Barnett Road in 2001 followed by Barnett Road west past FM 369 in 2010 to tie in which a project now underway to transform U.S. 277 into a continuous four-lane expressway between Wichita Falls and Abilene.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.txdot.gov/inside-txdot/projects/studies/wichita-falls/us-277-expansion.html|title=US 277 Expansion|last=Texas)|first=Texas Department of Transportation (State of|website=www.txdot.gov|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref>
