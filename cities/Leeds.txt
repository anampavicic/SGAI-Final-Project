'''Leeds''' is a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]]{{efn|The area that is the subject of this article does not have legal city status itself, but is widely regarded as a city since it is the main and nominate settlement in the City of Leeds local government area}} in [[West Yorkshire]], England. It is the largest settlement in Yorkshire and the administrative centre of the [[City of Leeds |City of Leeds Metropolitan Borough]], which is the [[List of English districts by population|second most populous district]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is built around the [[River Aire]] and is in the eastern foothills of the [[Pennines]]. The city was a small manorial borough in the 13th century and a [[market town]] in the 16th century. It expanded by becoming a major production and trading centre (mainly with [[wool]]) in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Leeds developed as a [[mill town]] during the [[Industrial Revolution]] alongside other surrounding villages and towns in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. It was also known for its [[flax]] industry, [[Foundry|iron foundries]], engineering and printing, as well as shopping, with several surviving [[Victorian era]] arcades, such as [[Leeds Kirkgate Market|Kirkgate Market]].<ref name="ene">{{cite web |title=Leeds and West Yorkshire |url=https://englandsnortheast.co.uk/yorkshire-leeds-west-yorkshire/ |access-date=6 June 2022 |website=England's North East }}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Burt|Grady|1994|p=92}}</ref> City status was awarded in 1893, and a populous urban centre formed in the following century which absorbed surrounding villages and overtook the population of nearby [[York]].<ref name="ene"/><ref>{{cite web |date=14 March 2021 |title=A History of Leeds |url=https://localhistories.org/a-history-of-leeds/ |access-date=6 June 2022 |website=Local Histories }}</ref>

===Toponymy===
The name derives from the old [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] ''*Lātēnses'' (via Late Brittonic ''Lādēses''), composed of the [[Proto-Celtic language|Celtic]] root ''*lāt-'' "violent, boiling" and the borrowed Latin plural derivational suffix -ēnses meaning "people of the fast-flowing river", in reference to the [[River Aire]] that flows through the city.<ref>Jackson, Kenneth Hurlstone.

[[Bede]] states in the fourteenth chapter of his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People|Ecclesiastical History]]'', in a discussion of an altar surviving from a church erected by [[Edwin of Northumbria]], that it is located in ''...regione quae vocatur Loidis'' (Latin, "the region which is called Loidis"). An inhabitant of Leeds is locally known as a ''[[Loiner]]'', a word of uncertain origin.<ref name=loiner>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/leeds/content/articles/2005/01/06/voices2005_loiner_feature.shtml |title=Loiners of the world unite! |publisher=BBC |date=22 August 2005 |access-date=27 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519152913/http://www.bbc.co.uk/leeds/content/articles/2005/01/06/voices2005_loiner_feature.shtml |archive-date=19 May 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> The term ''Leodensian'' is also used, from the city's Latin name.

Leeds developed as a [[market town]] in the [[Middle Ages]] as part of the local agricultural economy.

Before the [[Industrial Revolution]], it became a co-ordination centre for the manufacture of woollen cloth, and white [[broadcloth]] was traded at its [[1st White Cloth Hall|White Cloth Hall]].<ref name=cloth>{{cite journal |title=Houses as Museums: The Case of the Yorkshire Wool Textile Industry |journal=Transactions of the Royal Historical Society |first=S.&nbsp;A. |last=Caunce |pages=329–343 |year=2003 |volume=13 |publisher=Royal Historical Society |doi=10.1017/S0080440103000197 |doi-broken-date=1 November 2024 |s2cid=111082735 |issn=0080-4401}}</ref> Leeds handled one sixth of England's export trade in 1770.<ref>{{Harvnb|Burt|Grady|1994|p=57}}</ref> Growth, initially in textiles, was accelerated by the creation of the [[Aire and Calder Navigation]] in 1699 (with major additional works in the 18th century) and the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] in 1816.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|1982|p=143}}</ref> In the late [[Georgian period|Georgian]] era, [[Lupton family|William Lupton]] was one of a number of central Leeds landowners, some of whom, like him, were also textile manufacturers.

Leeds was a manor and township in the large ancient parish of ''Leeds St Peter'', in the [[Skyrack]] [[Hundred (county division)|wapentake]] of the [[West Riding of Yorkshire|West Riding]] of [[Yorkshire]].<ref name=vision_parish>{{cite web |title=Relationships / unit history of Leeds |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id%3D10443337 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814071837/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10443337 |archive-date=14 August 2011 |access-date=2 February 2017}}</ref> The Borough of Leeds was created in 1207, when Maurice Paynel, lord of the manor, granted a charter to a small area of the manor, close to the river crossing, in what is now the city centre. King [[James VI and I|James I]] granted the borough to his wife, [[Anne of Denmark]], and in 1612, she ordered a survey of the borough; in 1615 she was petitioned to remove the strict [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] preacher Alexander Cooke as vicar of Leeds, but she refused.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thornton |first=David |title=Leeds: A Biographical Dictionary |publisher=Beecroft Publications |year=2021 |pages=6}}</ref>

The inhabitants petitioned [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] for a charter of incorporation, which was granted in 1626. The new charter incorporated the entire parish, including all eleven townships, as the [[County Borough of Leeds|Borough of Leeds]] and withdrew the earlier charter.

[[Leeds City Police|Leeds Borough Police]] force was formed in 1836, and [[Leeds Town Hall]] was completed by the corporation in 1858. In 1866, Leeds and each of the other townships in the borough became [[civil parish]]es. The borough became a [[county borough]] in 1889, giving it independence from the newly formed West Riding County Council and it gained [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 1893.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Beckett |first1=John |title=City Status in the British Isles. |date=2017 |orig-date=2005 |publisher=Taylor and Francis |location=London |isbn=9781351951265 |page=57}}</ref> In 1904 the Leeds parish absorbed [[Beeston, Leeds|Beeston]], [[Chapel Allerton]], [[Farnley, West Yorkshire|Farnley]], [[Headingley cum Burley]] and [[Potternewton]] from within the borough. In the twentieth century the county borough initiated a series of significant territorial expansions, growing from {{convert|21593|acres|km2}} in 1911 to {{convert|40612|acres|km2}} in 1961.<ref name=vision_cb>{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id%3D10108809%26c_id%3D10001043 |title=Leeds MB/CB |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213031954/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10108809&c_id=10001043 |archive-date=13 February 2012 |access-date=2 February 2017}}</ref> In 1912 the parish and county borough of Leeds absorbed [[Leeds Rural District]], consisting of the parishes of [[Roundhay]] and [[Seacroft]]; and [[Shadwell, West Yorkshire|Shadwell]], which had been part of Wetherby Rural District. On 1 April 1925, the parish of Leeds was expanded to cover the whole borough.<ref name=vision_parish/>

The county borough was abolished on 1 April 1974, and its former area was combined with that of the municipal boroughs of [[Municipal Borough of Morley|Morley]] and [[Municipal Borough of Pudsey|Pudsey]]; the urban districts of [[Aireborough]], [[Horsforth]], [[Otley]], [[Garforth]] and [[Rothwell, West Yorkshire|Rothwell]]; and parts of the rural districts of [[Tadcaster Rural District|Tadcaster]], [[Wetherby Rural District|Wetherby]], and [[Wharfedale Rural District|Wharfedale]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|1982|p=459}}</ref> This area formed a metropolitan district in the county of [[West Yorkshire]]. It gained both borough and city status and is known as the [[City of Leeds]]. Initially, local government services were provided by [[Leeds City Council]] and [[West Yorkshire County Council]]. When the county council was abolished in 1986, the city council absorbed its functions, and some powers passed to organisations such as the [[West Yorkshire Metro|West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority]]. From 1988 two run-down and derelict areas close to the [[Leeds city centre|city centre]] were designated for regeneration and became the responsibility of [[Leeds Development Corporation]], outside the planning remit of the city council.<ref name=leeds_dc>{{cite web |url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/citiesandregions/impacturban/ |title=Impact of Urban Development Corporations in Leeds, Bristol & Central Manchester |date=18 November 1998 |publisher=[[Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions]] |access-date=25 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211110418/http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/citiesandregions/impacturban/ |archive-date=11 December 2008}}</ref> Planning powers were restored to the local authority in 1995 when the development corporation was wound up.

===Suburban growth===

In 1801, 42% of the population of Leeds lived outside the township, in the wider borough. [[Cholera]] outbreaks in 1832 and 1849 caused the authorities to address the problems of drainage, sanitation, and water supply. Water was pumped from the River Wharfe, but by 1860 it was too heavily polluted to be usable. Following the Leeds Waterworks Act of 1867 three reservoirs were built at Lindley Wood, Swinsty, and Fewston in the Washburn Valley north of Leeds.<ref>{{Harvnb|Burt|Grady|1994|p=163}}</ref>

Residential growth occurred in Holbeck and Hunslet from 1801 to 1851, but, as these townships became industrialised new areas were favoured for middle class housing.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|1982|p=96}}</ref> Land south of the river was developed primarily for industry and secondarily for [[Back-to-back house|back-to-back]] workers' dwellings. The Leeds Improvement Act 1866 sought to improve the quality of working class housing by restricting the number of homes that could be built in a single terrace.<ref name=discover_house>{{cite web |url=http://www.leodis.net/discovery/discovery.asp?page=2003218_676159084&topic=2003218_372249783&subsection=200342_125637234 |publisher=Leeds City Council |work=Discovering Leeds |title=The Working Classes: Housing |access-date=26 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128161204/http://www.leodis.net/discovery/discovery.asp?page=2003218_676159084&topic=2003218_372249783&subsection=200342_125637234 |archive-date=28 November 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Holbeck and Leeds formed a continuous built-up area by 1858, with Hunslet nearly meeting them.<ref name="Fraser 1982 98">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1982|p=98}}</ref> In the latter half of the nineteenth century, population growth in Hunslet, Armley, and Wortley outstripped that of Leeds. When pollution became a problem, the wealthier residents left the industrial conurbation to live in Headingley, Potternewton and Chapel Allerton which led to a 50% increase in the population of Headingley and Burley from 1851 to 1861. The middle-class flight from the industrial areas led to development beyond the borough at Roundhay and Adel.<ref name="Fraser 1982 98"/> The introduction of the [[Leeds Tramway|electric tramway]] led to intensification of development in Headingley and Potternewton and expansion outside the borough into Roundhay.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|1982|p=57}}</ref>

Two private gas supply companies were taken over by the corporation in 1870, and the municipal supply provided street lighting and cheaper gas to homes. From the early 1880s, the Yorkshire House-to-House Electricity Company supplied electricity to Leeds until it was purchased by Leeds Corporation and became a municipal supply.<ref>{{Harvnb|Burt|Grady|1994|p=193}}</ref>

[[Slum clearance in the United Kingdom|Slum clearance]] and rebuilding began in Leeds during the [[interwar period]] when over 18,000 houses were built by the council on 24 estates in [[Cross Gates]], Middleton, Gipton, Belle Isle and Halton Moor. The slums of [[Quarry Hill, Leeds|Quarry Hill]] were replaced by the innovative Quarry Hill flats, which were demolished in 1975. Another 36,000 houses were built by private sector builders, creating suburbs in Gledhow, Moortown, Alwoodley, Roundhay, Colton, Whitkirk, [[Oakwood, Leeds|Oakwood]], Weetwood, and Adel. After 1949 a further 30,000 sub-standard houses were demolished by the council and replaced by 151 medium-rise and high-rise blocks of council flats in estates at Seacroft, Armley Heights, Tinshill, and Brackenwood.<ref>{{Harvnb|Unsworth and Stillwell|2004|p=77}}</ref> Leeds has seen great expenditure on regenerating the city, attracting in investments and flagship projects,<ref name="leeds_skyscraper">{{cite web |url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/news.php?ref=565 |website=www.skyscrapernews.com |title=Light Shines on Leeds Skyscraper Bids |access-date=24 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211133304/http://skyscrapernews.com/news.php?ref=565 |archive-date=11 February 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> as found in [[Leeds city centre]].

===Green belt===
{{further|South and West Yorkshire Green Belt}}

Leeds is within a [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] region that extends into the wider surrounding counties and is in place to reduce [[urban sprawl]], prevent the settlements in the West Yorkshire conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage [[Brownfield land|brownfield]] reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas, and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.<ref name="belt1">{{cite web |title=Unitary Development Plan |url=https://www.leeds.gov.uk/your-council/planning/unitary-development-plan |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322143636/https://www.leeds.gov.uk/your-council/planning/unitary-development-plan |archive-date=22 March 2018 |access-date=26 March 2018 |website=www.leeds.gov.uk}}</ref>

Over 60% of the Leeds district is green belt land and it surrounds the settlement, preventing further sprawl towards nearby communities. Larger outlying towns and villages are exempt from the green belt area. However, smaller villages, hamlets and rural areas are 'washed over' by the designation. The green belt was first adopted in 1960,<ref name="belt1" /> and the size in the borough in 2017 amounted to some {{convert|33,970|ha|km2+sqmi}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Green belt statistics – GOV.UK |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/green-belt-statistics |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703133634/https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/green-belt-statistics |archive-date=3 July 2018 |access-date=26 March 2018 |website=www.gov.uk}}</ref> A subsidiary aim of the green belt is to encourage recreation and leisure interests,<ref name="belt1" /> with rural landscape features, greenfield areas and facilities including Temple Newsam Park and House with golf course, Rothwell Country Park, Middleton Park, Kirkstall Abbey ruins and surrounding park, Bedquilts recreation grounds, Waterloo lake, Roundhay castle and park, and Morwick, Cobble and Elmete Halls.

[[File:Civic Hall Leeds West Yorkshire.jpg|right|thumb|[[Leeds Civic Hall]] is the seat of local government.]]
The [[City of Leeds]] is the [[Districts of England|local government district]] covering Leeds, and the local authority is [[Leeds City Council]]. The council is composed of 99 councillors, three for each of the district's [[wards of the United Kingdom|wards]]. Elections are held three years out of four, on the first Thursday of May. One third of the councillors are elected, for a four-year term, in each election. The council is currently controlled by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]. [[West Yorkshire]] does not have a county council, so Leeds City Council is the primary provider of local government services for the city. The district is in the [[Yorkshire and the Humber]] region of England.

Most of the district is an [[unparished area]]. In the unparished area, there is no lower tier of government.

*The [[Leeds Supertram]] in the 1990s at a cost of £500&nbsp;million was cancelled by the Transport Minister [[Alistair Darling]] in 2005 after £40&nbsp;million had been spent on the project due to unforeseen added costs.
*A proposed £250&nbsp;million re-introduction of [[Trolleybuses in Leeds|trolleybus]] in 2007; the plans were cancelled in May 2016 citing little value for money, after millions of pounds spent on inquiries.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/transport/not-suitable-for-development-leeds-trolleybus-scheme-is-thrown-out-1-7907098 |title='Not suitable for development': Leeds trolleybus scheme is thrown out |work=Yorkshire Evening Post |access-date=12 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818001641/http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/transport/not-suitable-for-development-leeds-trolleybus-scheme-is-thrown-out-1-7907098 |archive-date=18 August 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>
