==History==
[[File:Luther Menifee Wilson.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Luther Menifee Wilson]]
The area are the traditional lands of the [[Luiseño]] people, specifically the [[Pechanga Band of Luiseño Indians|Pechanga band]]. In the 18th century, the area fell under [[Spanish Empire|Spanish rule]] and was ceded by [[Mexico]] to the [[United States]] in 1848 as a result of the [[Mexican–American War]].

Farming, which began in the mid-19th century, was concentrated in the Menifee area. Mining began in the early 1880s with the discovery of a significant quartz lode by miner Luther Menifee Wilson, from whom Menifee derived its name.<ref>{{cite news|last=Love|first=Carl|title=Preserving memories of Menifee's past |url=https://www.pressenterprise.com/2012/01/07/preserving-memories-of-menifee8217s-past/|work=[[Press Enterprise]]|date=January 7, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Hunneman|first=John|title=Roots, mines ran deep in Menifee |url=https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-roots-mines-ran-deep-in-menifee-2007dec17-story.html|work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]|date=December 17, 2007}}</ref> Wilson discovered a gold-bearing quartz ledge near present day Holland and Murrieta roads in 1883, and filed a claim with the San Diego County Recorder’s office for this new “Menifee” mine. At the time, the area was referred to as the Menifee Valley.<ref>{{cite news|author=Menifee History Museum|title=They Made Their Way to Menifee: Luther Menifee Wilson Came Seeking Gold|url=https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/cbb5e4bc-e2ba-46ab-aa40-e02ac47c3c2d/downloads/Made%20Their%20Way%20-%20Luther%20Menifee%20Wilson.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220723222453/https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/cbb5e4bc-e2ba-46ab-aa40-e02ac47c3c2d/downloads/Made%20Their%20Way%20-%20Luther%20Menifee%20Wilson.pdf|archive-date=July 23, 2022}}</ref>

Early development of the Menifee area began with Sun City in the early 1960s, conceptualized as an active retirement community by [[Del Webb]], a building contractor from [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. Webb also developed [[Sun City, Arizona]], under the same concept. Sun City is located in the northwestern part of Menifee and features a mix of residential and commercial activity.

The Menifee area later grew during the late 1980s and early 1990s as a master-planned community. However, a lack of resources such as industry-oriented occupations and high-density retail and commercial businesses caused many residents to drive to cities such as [[Temecula, California|Temecula]] or [[Murrieta, California|Murrieta]] to shop, dine, or work. In recent years, however, there has been substantial growth in Menifee, attracting many new residents from all areas of Southern California such as San Diego, Orange County and Los Angeles, as well as other parts of the Inland Empire.

On June 3, 2008, the residents of the communities encompassing the Menifee area voted to incorporate together to form Riverside County's 26th city. The City of Menifee was officially established on October 1, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofmenifee.us/index.aspx?nid=85|title=History - Menifee, CA - Official Website|website=www.cityofmenifee.us|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220113045539/https://www.cityofmenifee.us/85/History|archive-date=January 13, 2022}}</ref>
