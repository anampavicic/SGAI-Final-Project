'''Rockford''' is a city in [[Winnebago County, Illinois]], United States. Located in far [[northern Illinois]] on the banks of the [[Rock River (Mississippi River tributary)|Rock River]], Rockford is the county seat of Winnebago County (with a small portion of the city located in [[Ogle County, Illinois|Ogle County]]). The population was 148,655 at the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], making Rockford the [[List of municipalities in Illinois|fifth-most populous city]] in Illinois, as well as the state's most populous city outside of the [[Chicago metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite web |date=May 2014 |title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places of 50,000 or More, Ranked by July 1, 2013 Population: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2013 |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2013/PEPANNRSIP.US12A |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212200408/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2013/PEPANNRSIP.US12A |archive-date=2020-02-12 |access-date=September 16, 2014 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division}}</ref> It anchors the [[Rockford metropolitan area, Illinois|Rockford metropolitan area]], which had 338,798 residents in 2020.

Settled in the mid-1830s as Midway due to its location roughly equidistant between [[Lake Michigan]] and the [[Mississippi River]], Rockford became strategic for industrial development. During the second half of the 19th century, it became notable for its production of heavy machinery, hardware, and tools. At the beginning of the 20th century, the city was the second leading center of furniture manufacturing in the U.S. During the second half of the 20th century, Rockford struggled alongside many [[Rust Belt]] cities to maintain its previous industrial presence. Since the late 1990s, efforts in economic diversification have led to the growth of automotive, aerospace, and healthcare industries, as well as the undertaking of various tourism and downtown revitalization efforts.

Nicknamed "the Forest City" for its heavily forested residential neighborhoods during the 20th century, Rockford is known for various venues of cultural or historical significance, including [[Anderson Japanese Gardens]], [[Klehm Arboretum and Botanic Garden|Klehm Arboretum]], [[Tinker Swiss Cottage]], the [[BMO Harris Bank Center]], the [[Coronado Theatre]], the [[Laurent House]], and the [[Burpee Museum of Natural History]]. Its contributions to music are noted in the Mendelssohn Club, the oldest music club in the U.S., and performers such as [[Cheap Trick]] and [[Phantom Regiment Drum and Bugle Corps]].

==History==

===Settlement and development===

[[File:Rockford 1880-1899.jpg|thumb|Rockford Station, circa 1890]]

Rockford traces its roots to 1834, as the combined settlements of Midway were founded on both banks of the Rock River. On the west bank, Germanicus Kent and Thatcher Blake (with his slave Lewis Lemon) founded Kentville; the east bank was settled by Daniel Shaw Haight. With the location of the Rock River equidistant between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River, the combined settlement derived the name "Midway".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rockford|title=Dictionary and Thesaurus - Merriam-Webster|access-date=July 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/506337/Rockford|title=Rockford - Illinois, United States|access-date=July 4, 2016}}</ref> In 1836, Winnebago County was created (from both [[Jo Daviess County, Illinois|Jo Daviess]] and [[LaSalle County, Illinois|LaSalle]] counties), with Midway named as its county seat, as it was "halfway between Galena and Chicago on a line of four-horse coaches."<ref>Addams, J. (2004). My friend Julia Lathrop. New York: MacMillan.</ref>

In 1837, the village of Midway was renamed Rockford, highlighting a rocky [[Ford (crossing)|river ford]] across the Rock River in the village.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gorockford.com/includes/media/docs/Rockford-Fact-Sheet.pdf|title=All About Rockford, Illinois|last=Bridget|first=French|website=Rockford Area Convention & Visitors Bureau|access-date=June 27, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904110947/http://www.gorockford.com/includes/media/docs/Rockford-Fact-Sheet.pdf|archive-date=September 4, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the same year, Rockford established its first post office, with Daniel Shaw Haight as the first postmaster. In 1840, the first weekly newspaper began circulation. In 1847, Rockford Female Seminary  &ndash; today [[Rockford University]] &ndash; was founded. On January 3, 1852, Rockford was officially chartered as a city;<ref name="ilarch"/><ref>{{cite news |title=The History and Statistics of American Water-Works |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMlBAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA6 |access-date=16 March 2021 |work=Engineering News-record |date=January 7, 1882}}</ref> a year later the long-running "Forest City" nickname first appeared, used by the ''[[New-York Tribune|New York Tribune]]''. Also in 1852, the [[Galena and Chicago Union Railroad]] connected Rockford to Chicago by railroad.

At the time of its founding, many of the village's residents were transplants from the [[Northeastern United States]] and [[upstate New York]].<ref>History of Rockford and Winnebago County, Illinois: From the First Settlement in 1834 to the Civil War pg. 253</ref> Descended from English Puritans, the Midway/Rockford population was similar to much of the rest of northern Illinois and nearly all of Wisconsin during the mid-19th century. After the [[Black Hawk War]], additional immigrants moved to northern Illinois; during the 1830s and 1840s, Rockford and Winnebago County were considered a cultural extension of New England.<ref>The Expansion of New England: The Spread of New England Settlement and Institutions to the Mississippi River, 1620-1865 by Lois imball Mathews pg. 210-212</ref>

During the antebellum period, Rockford shared abolitionist leanings, lending considerable support to the [[Free Soil Party]] and the later [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. In 1848, 42 percent of voters in Winnebago County (where Rockford dominated as the county seat) voted for [[Martin Van Buren]]. In 1852, Free Soil candidate [[John P. Hale]] became the first presidential candidate to visit Rockford, although he would only receive 28 percent of the vote. In 1860, [[Abraham Lincoln]] won 3,985 votes in Winnebago County to the 817 votes of [[Stephen A. Douglas]].<ref>History of Rockford and Winnebago County, Illinois: From the First Settlement in 1834 to the Civil War, pg. 379</ref>

The 1850s brought industry that would change Rockford forever. In 1853, inventor [[John Henry Manny]] moved to Rockford to produce horse-drawn mechanical [[reaper]]s for farmers and transport the finished products by rail. Chicago implement manufacturer [[Cyrus McCormick]] (whose company became [[International Harvester]]) took Manny to court after he produced nearly 6,000 machines; Manny would prevail on both judgement and an appeal. Along with the production of agricultural machines, Swedish furniture cooperatives established the city as a manufacturing base. The Rockford Union Furniture Company, under [[John Erlander]], spearheaded these cooperatives. Today, Erlander's home is a Rockford museum that shows his efforts in elevating Rockford to second in furniture manufacturing in the United States, behind [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]].<ref>Lundin, Jon W. "Rockford, An Illustrated History, Windsor Publications 1989 p. 8
</ref>

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], one of the first Illinois regiments to be mobilized, the Zouaves, were from Rockford. The city also served as the site for Camp Fuller, a training site for four other infantry regiments.

In 1884, Rockford established its first city-wide public school district, constructing [[Rockford Central High School]] in 1885; following the construction of the high school, the district began construction of brick multi-story multigrade school buildings across the city.

The Rockford Female Seminary became the alma mater of [[Jane Addams]] in 1881. The move accompanied the Seminary's transition into a more complete curriculum, which was represented by its renaming to Rockford College in 1892. Culture flourished with the founding of the Mendelssohn Club in 1884, which became the oldest operating music club in the United States. It was complemented by the construction of a [[Carnegie library]] in 1902, which became the first building of Rockford's public library system. 1903 saw the dedication of the [[Winnebago County War Memorial|Winnebago County Veterans Memorial Hall]] in the presence of sitting President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. Roosevelt returned to Rockford during his [[1912 U.S. Presidential election|campaign in 1912]] and again to address the soldiers at [[Camp Grant (Illinois)|Camp Grant]], a training site for [[World War I]] soldiers.

===20th century===

The twentieth century saw demographic changes to Rockford. An influx of Italians, Poles, Lithuanians, and African Americans replaced the previously dominant Irish and Swedes. The city was also no stranger to contemporary political issues. Electorally divided between wets and drys on the subject of [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]], Rockford featured a coalition of labor unionists and socialists that elected numerous aldermen and carried 25 to 40 percent in mayoral elections. During World War I, an antiwar protest by the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] led to 118 arrests. In 1920, the city was a target of the [[Palmer Raids]]. While its congressional district favored Republicans, Rockford continuously elected former socialists as mayor between 1921 and 1955.

One of its contemporary attractions, the [[Coronado Theatre]], opened in 1927. Noted for its [[Atmospheric theatre|atmospheric styling]], the Coronado rivaled its counterparts in Chicago and was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1979.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/411|title = Coronado Performing Arts Center|access-date = June 27, 2014|website = Cinema Treasures|last = Krefft|first = Bryan}}</ref> Camp Grant was turned over to the Illinois National Guard. During World War II, it reopened as an induction center and POW detention camp. The [[USS Rockford (PF-48)|USS ''Rockford'']], a [[Tacoma-class frigate]] named for the city, was commissioned in March 1944 and earned two service stars.

In the September 1949 issue of ''[[Life Magazine|Life]]'' magazine, postwar Rockford was described as "nearly typical of the U.S. as any city can be." Due to this archetypal nature, sociologists like [[W. Lloyd Warner]] warned of the necessity to "understand the realities of their system."<ref>{{Cite news|title = A sociologist looks at an American community|last = Warner|first = W. Lloyd|date = September 12, 1949|work = Life Magazine|publisher = Life Magazine|pages = 108–119}}</ref> In the late 1950s, Rockford lost over 50,000 trees to [[Dutch elm disease]], thinning the tree canopy of the "Forest City" for decades.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockfordreminisce.com/tidbits/|title=tidbits|last=Services|first=DNC Web|website=RockfordReminisce.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref>

From 1955 to 1965, several events would take place that would shape the development of Rockford into the 21st century.  In 1956, construction was approved for a four-lane US 20 bypass;<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockfordreminisce.com/timeline/|title=timeline|last=Services|first=DNC Web|website=RockfordReminisce.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref> along with shifting truck traffic away from the downtown routing of the highway, the bypass established much of the southern border of the city (which remains to this day). In 1958, Interstate 90 was completed in Illinois, becoming the Northwest Tollway;<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.midwayvillage.com/pdfs/timeline-of-rockford-history.pdf|title=TIMELINE OF ROCKFORD'S HISTORY|website=Midway Village}}</ref> in a decision that would change Rockford forever, the interstate highway was not routed through the city, but near the Winnebago-Boone county line, with the eastern terminus of the US 20 bypass in Cherry Valley.

In 1963, the Rockford area was selected by Chrysler Corporation to construct an assembly plant; the final site of what is now the [[Belvidere Assembly Plant]] is southwest of Belvidere, between US 20 and Interstate 90.<ref name=":2" /> While not located directly in the city, the Chrysler assembly plant has served as one of the largest employers of the region since its 1965 opening.

The growth of Rockford led to many changes to its educational systems. In 1955, Rockford College &ndash; now [[Rockford University]] &ndash; became co-educational for the first time. Coinciding with the expansion of the student body, the college outgrew its near-east side campus in use since the 1840s. After the acquisition of land in 1957, construction began on its present-day campus location, opening in 1964.<ref name=":2" /> In 1964, [[Rock Valley College]] was founded as a two-year community college, with construction on its campus commencing in 1965.<ref name=":2" />

Prior to the 1960s, neighborhood and economic growth in Rockford largely mirrored itself on both sides of the Rock River. As the 20th century progressed, growth in western Rockford (and established neighborhoods in eastern areas of the city) struggled to compete with economic development that moved further east. From the late 1950s, downtown Rockford (centered around the intersection of IL 2 and US 20; Main Street and West State Street) began to decline as the primary shopping district of the city. In 1956, North Towne Mall opened on the far northwest side of the city, with Colonial Village opening on the (then) far east side in 1962, both of which were partially enclosed (some stores had exterior entrances).<ref>http://mall-hall-of-fame.blogspot.com/2009/10/cherryvale-mall-harrison-avenue-and.html Also see [[Cherryvale Mall]] confirming assertion</ref> In 1973, [[Cherryvale Mall]] was opened as the first fully enclosed shopping mall in the city; nearly 6 miles from the city center, the mall was located at the intersection of the US-20 bypass and the Northwest Tollway, sharing a city border with Cherry Valley.

While growth at the eastern end of Rockford undersaw favorable conditions for growth, established neighborhoods began to suffer irrevocable decline.<ref name="Lundin, Jon W p.122">Lundin, Jon W.

Rockford is approximately 90 miles west-northwest of downtown [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], and 70 miles south-southeast of [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]].

=== Waterways ===
[[File:Fordham Dam Rockford IL.jpg|thumb|Fordham Dam across Rock River]]

The [[Rock River (Illinois)|Rock River]] forms the traditional center of Rockford and is its most recognizable natural feature.  One of its largest tributaries, the [[Kishwaukee River]], joins the Rock River at the southern end of the city near the Rockford airport.  Since the 1946 closure of Camp Grant, much of the length of Kishwaukee has been redeveloped into parkland and forest preserves, effectively forming the southern border of the city.  Other waterways that feed into the Rock River include Spring Creek (northeast region), Keith Creek (east region), and Kent Creek (west region).  Of the 8 Illinois dams of the Rock River, the Fordham dam is located south of downtown.

=== Climate ===
Summers are usually hot and humid with the average high temperature in July (the hottest month) being {{convert|83.9|°F}}.<ref name=nws/><ref name=NCEI/> The winter months can bring bitterly cold Arctic air masses. The average high temperature in January (the coldest month) is {{convert|29.1|°F}}.<ref name=nws/><ref name=NCEI/> June is Rockford's wettest month while January is the driest.

Rockford and surrounding areas are prone to violent [[thunderstorm]]s during March, April, May, and June. On [[1967 Oak Lawn tornado outbreak|April 21, 1967]], a violent [[Fujita scale|F4]] [[tornado]] struck the neighboring town of [[Belvidere, Illinois|Belvidere]], killing twenty-four people and injuring hundreds more at Belvidere's High School. Other severe weather events, such as [[hail]] and strong winds are common in these storms. On July 5, 2003, at 04:13, a line of severe storms and their associated high winds caused widespread damage on both the east and west sides of Rockford.<ref name="Rockford Wind Event">{{cite web|url=https://www.weather.gov/lot/2003_jul5_winds |title=Damaging Winds at Rockford and Around Chicagoland |publisher=National Weather Service |date=2003}}</ref> Approximately 70,000 people were without power, with many on the west side suffering in the heat without electricity for a week. It took months to clear the damage, but because the storm struck so early in the morning there were no injuries or fatalities. However, these sometimes violent storms bring the majority of summer rainfall.

The city is also prone to severe [[snow]]storms in winter, and [[blizzard]]s are frequent winter occurrences. On January 13, 1979, over 9 inches (23&nbsp;cm) of snow fell on Rockford in just a few hours during one of the strongest blizzards in the city's history. The city averages approximately 36 inches (91.4&nbsp;cm) of snowfall in a normal winter, but greater amounts are common. The snowiest winter in the history of the city was the winter of 1978–1979, when {{convert|74.5|in|cm|0}} of snow fell.

===Air===
{{Main|Chicago Rockford International Airport}}
[[File:Main Terminal at Chicago-Rockford Int'l Airport.JPG|thumb|Main terminal at [[Chicago Rockford International Airport]]]]

The first airport serving the Rockford area was Machesney Airport, located north of the city alongside US 51.  Opened in 1927, the airport was initially a private airport; during World War II, it was utilized by the Army Air Corps. After the war, Machesney Airport was opened as a municipal airport. In 1974, the location was closed, becoming the site of the [[Machesney Park Mall]] in 1980.

After [[Camp Grant (Illinois)|Camp Grant]]'s final closure in 1946, the state legislature allowed for the establishment of an airport to serve Rockford, leading to the creation of the Greater Rockford Airport Authority (GRAA). In 1948, the GRAA received a 1500-acre portion of the Camp Grant property between US 51 and the Rock River, located between the southern border of the city and [[New Milford, Illinois|New Milford]].

From the 1950s to 1970s, the Greater Rockford Airport served as a regional airport, with small airlines offering both turboprop and jet service. To further expand passenger service, the current passenger terminal was constructed in 1987. Competing against easy highway access (and bus service) to [[O'Hare International Airport]], the airport struggled for passenger service during the 1990s, leading to the loss of passenger service from 2001 to 2003. Since 2003, the airport has restored passenger service, primarily marketing its location for leisure travelers. Following the closure of several airlines, the location is served by [[Allegiant Air]] as its passenger carrier.  Following a 2005 upgrade, the passenger terminal was expanded in size in 2018.

During the 2000s, the airport underwent several name changes, adopting the current [[Chicago Rockford International Airport]] moniker in 2007. Among the fastest-growing freight airports in the world, full-scale cargo operations began in 1994 as [[UPS Airlines|United Parcel Service]] (UPS) opened an air package hub at the airport next to the terminal. Second only to [[WorldPort (UPS air hub)|Worldport]] in the [[UPS Airlines]] operations, the Rockford UPS hub operates on a separate 50-acre ramp (parking up to 40 aircraft at a time), accommodating up to a Boeing 747-8F.

Next to the UPS facilities, another cargo ramp was built in 2008, intended to attract additional cargo airlines.  In 2016, the facilities were leased by [[ABX Air|ABX]], intending to transfer freight from aircraft to trucks; the operations transitioned into flights for [[Amazon Air]], who partners with ABX, [[Air Transport International|ATI]], and [[Atlas Air]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Braun |first=Georgette |date=September 9, 2016 |title=Boxes with Amazon's logo leave on plane today, marking watershed moment for Rockford airport |url=http://www.rrstar.com/news/20160909/boxes-with-amazons-logo-leave-on-plane-today-marking-watershed-moment-for-rockford-airport |access-date=August 15, 2018 |website=Rockford Register Star }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Guerrero |first=Isaac |date=July 24, 2018 |title=Rockford airport moves up to nation's 22nd busiest cargo airport |url=http://www.rrstar.com/news/20180724/rockford-airport-moves-up-to-nations-22nd-busiest-cargo-airport |access-date=August 15, 2018 |website=Rockford Register Star }}</ref>  The same year, [[AAR Corp]]oration opened an [[Fixed-base operator|FBO]] facility on the southern end of the airport, building hangars large enough to accommodate an [[Airbus A380]]. In 2021, cargo operations were expanded further, as the airport constructed an additional cargo-handling facility and cargo ramp, introducing service by German air cargo company Senator International, contracting 747s by [[Air Atlanta Icelandic]]. In 2022, [[Korean Air Cargo]] introduced cargo service from Seoul to Rockford on 777-300 freighters, becoming the longest flight from the airport.

===Rail===
====Passenger====

For over four decades, the Rockford region has not been served by passenger rail. From 1974 to 1981, Rockford was served by [[Amtrak]] via its [[Black Hawk (Amtrak train)|''Black Hawk'']] route, a daily train service from [[Dubuque, Iowa]] to [[Union Station (Chicago)|Union Station]] in [[Chicago]] with a stop in Rockford. The ''Black Hawk'' was discontinued in September 1981 as part of funding cuts to Amtrak.

During the 2000s, interest increased in relinking the Rockford and Chicago regions by rail. In 2006, the [[Northern Illinois Commuter Transportation Initiative]] proposed extending [[Metra]] train service from the western Chicago suburbs to Rockford.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.rrstar.com/belvidere/x914621510 | title=All aboard?

In 2023, it was announced that Metra would provide service to Rockford as an extension of the [[Milwaukee District West Line]], with twice-daily service in each direction beginning in 2027.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Schobinger |first1=Meghan |title=Metra to bring rail service to Rockford, Belvidere in 2027 |url=https://www.wifr.com/2023/07/06/metra-bring-rail-service-rockford-belvidere-2027/ |access-date=6 July 2023 |work=[[WIFR-LD]] |date=6 July 2023 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Neveau |first1=James |title=Metra to restore rail service between Rockford, Chicago for first time in 40 years |url=https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/metra-to-restore-rail-service-between-rockford-chicago-for-first-time-in-40-years/3181232/ |access-date=6 July 2023 |work=NBC Chicago |date=6 July 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Gov.

====Freight====
Rockford is served by several different freight railroad lines, the [[Union Pacific]], the [[Canadian National]], the [[Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad|Iowa, Chicago & Eastern]] ([[Canadian Pacific]]), and the [[Illinois Railway]]. The Union Pacific line from [[West Chicago]] terminates in Rockford at a small yard.

The Canadian National line from [[Addison, Illinois|Addison]] enters from the Southeast and leaves in the Northwest. They have a small yard where they interchange with the [[Illinois Railway]]. The [[Illinois Railway]] Rockford Line comes from the South, joins the Canadian National line, where they continue on [[trackage rights]] to the Canadian National yard. Canadian Pacific (Iowa, Chicago, and Eastern) runs on Illinois Railway trackage rights from Davis Junction, and leaves on their own trackage to the North. All of the railroads interchange at a yard off of Main Street.

The Union Pacific Railroad's Global III Intermodal Facility is approximately {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} south of Rockford in [[Rochelle, Illinois]], a community of 10,000. The complex is one of the world's largest [[intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] facilities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Construction on the state-of-the-art facility was completed in 2003 in Rochelle due to the close proximity to four interstate highways (I-39, I-88, I-80, and I-90) and rail routes.
