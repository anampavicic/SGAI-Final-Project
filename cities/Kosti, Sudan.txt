'''Kosti''' (also '''Kusti''', {{langx|ar|كوستي}}) is one of the major cities in [[Sudan]] that lies south of [[Khartoum]], the capital of [[Sudan]], and stands on the western bank of the [[White Nile]] river opposite [[Rabak]], the capital of the [[White Nile (state)|White Nile]] state and is connected to it by a bridge. The city is served by Kosti Railway Station and [[Rabak Airport]]. The population of Kosti as of 2012 was estimated at 345,068 people.

== History ==
Kosti was founded shortly after 1899 by the Greek merchant Konstantinos "Kostas" Mourikis, who arrived in Sudan along with his brother following the [[Anglo-Egyptian invasion of Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian]] victory over the indigenous [[Mahdist Sudan|Mahdist]] state.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chaldeos|first=Antonios|date=2017|title=Sudanese toponyms related to Greek entrepreneurial activity|url=http://digitalcommons.fairfield.edu/djns/vol4/iss1/4/|journal=Dotawo: A Journal of Nubian Studies|volume= 4, Art. 1.|via=DigitalCommons@Fairfield}}</ref> He set up a store on the White Nile, where pilgrims from [[West Africa]] to [[Mecca]] and Southern trade routes crossed. The settlement soon grew to a town and was named after "Kostas", illustrating the important role played by the [[Greeks in Sudan]], especially in the field of trade.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the Sudan|last1=Kramer|first1=Robert|last2=Lobban|first2=Richard|last3=Fluehr-Lobban|first3=Carolyn|publisher=The Scarecrow Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-8108-6180-0|edition=4th|location=Lanham / Toronto / Plymouth (UK)|pages=191–192}}</ref>

== Economy ==
The large Kenana [[sugar refinery]] is located in Rabak east of the city.

Kosti is home to the [[El Imam El Mahdi University]], established in 1994 as a public university funded by the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research.
It is named in honor of [[Muhammad Ahmad]], the leader of the Mahdia revolution in Sudan (1885-1898).<ref>{{cite web
