==History==
{{Further|Belgaum Fort}}

[[File:Belgaum 1896 map.jpg|left|thumb|Belgaum 1896 map]]
Belgaum was founded in late 12th century AD by the [[Ratta dynasty]], who shifted from nearby [[Saundatti]]. A Ratta official named Bichiraja built [[Kamal Basadi]], a Jain temple, dedicated to [[Neminatha]] in 1204, which came to be called Kamalabasti. Pillars found inside Belgaum fort have Kannada inscriptions in Nagari scripts, one from 1199 by Ratta King Kartaveerya IV. The city's original name was Venugram, a Sanskrit word which means "village of bamboo". Alternatively, it is referred to as Venugram in early Indian texts, which means "city of bamboo".<ref name="MeisterDhaky1996p255">{{cite book|author1=Michael W. Meister|author2=Madhusudan A. Dhaky|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p1GzJRNhnnsC|year=1996|publisher=American Institute of Indian Studies|isbn=978-81-86526-00-2|page=255}}</ref>

Belgaum became a part of the [[Yadava dynasty]] kingdom (Sevunas) in early 13th century. An inscription from 1261 of King Krishna belonging to the Yadava dynasty attests to this. The region was invaded by [[Khalji dynasty]] of [[Delhi Sultanate]] in 14th century. Shortly thereafter, the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] was founded, and Belgaum came under the rule of Vijayanagara. In 1474, the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] conquered Belgaum with an army led by [[Mahmud Gawan]].<ref name=cexise1>{{cite web |url=http://www.centralexcisebelgaum.kar.nic.in/belgaum.htm |title=History of Belgaum |publisher=Central Excise Belgaum |access-date=17 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310035121/http://www.centralexcisebelgaum.kar.nic.in/belgaum.htm |archive-date=10 March 2015 }}</ref>
[[File:Gandhi at the Belgaum Congress 1924.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mahatma Gandhi]] at the Belgaum Congress 1924]]
The Belgaum fort was strengthened by the Adil Shah dynasty Sultans and they built the Safa Mosque. A Persian inscription states that the mosque was built by [[Asad Khan (Bijapuri noble)|Asad Khan]], a Bijapur commander. In 1518, the Bahamani sultanate splintered into five small states and Belgaum became part of the [[Bijapur Sultanate]]. The Adilshahis extended their control to the port of Goa, but retreated after the arrival and wars with the Portuguese. In 1686, the Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] overthrew the Bijapur sultanate and Belgaum passed nominally to the Mughals, who called it "Azamnagar".<ref name=cexise1/> However, the Mughal empire control collapsed after the death of Aurangzeb in 1707. The [[Maratha]] confederacy took control of the area during the rule of the [[Peshwa]]s. In 1776, the region was overrun by [[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]] after Hyder Ali's coup in the [[Kingdom of Mysore]]. The Peshwa regained Belgaum, after Tipu Sultan was defeated by the British forces. In 1818, the [[East India Company|British]] annexed Belgaum and the region in the control of the Peshwa. [[Kitturu Chennamma]] (1778–1829) was the queen of the princely state of Kittur in [[Karnataka]] and in 1824 she led an unsuccessful armed rebellion against the British in response to the [[Doctrine of lapse]].

Belgaum was chosen as the venue of the 39th session of the [[Indian National Congress]] in December 1924 under the presidency of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. The city served as a major military installation for the [[British Raj]], primarily due to its proximity to [[Goa]], which was then a Portuguese territory. Once the British left India, the Indian government continued and still continues to have armed forces installations in Belgaum. In 1961, the Indian government, under Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], used military forces from Belgaum to end [[Portugal|Portuguese]] rule of [[Goa]].

When India became independent in 1947, Belgaum and its district were part of [[Bombay State]]. In 1956, the Indian states were reorganised along linguistic lines by the [[States Reorganisation Act]] and Belgaum  including 10 taluks of Bombay State were transferred to [[Mysore State]], which was renamed [[Karnataka]] in 1973.<ref name="TOI-Dispute">{{cite news |title=Karnataka-Maharashtra border dispute Explained: What is Belagavi border dispute between Karnataka and Maharashtra |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/explained-what-is-belagavi-border-dispute-between-karnataka-and-maharashtra/articleshow/80493402.cms |access-date=31 May 2022 |work=The Times of India |date=28 January 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

In 2006, the [[Government of Karnataka]] announced that Belgaum would be made the state's second capital, and that the city would be a permanent venue for the annual 15-day winter session of the state legislature.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/pti_news.asp?id=418913|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213061758/http://www.outlookindia.com/pti_news.asp?id=418913|title=Belgaum to be made Karnataka's second capital|archive-date=13 February 2009|magazine=Outlook |access-date=31 May 2022}}</ref>

== City names ==
On 1 November 2014, the city's name was changed from Belgaum to Belagavi by the Karnataka government, with approval of the [[central government of India]] along with 12 other cities.<ref>{{cite news|title=It'll be 'Bengaluru' from 1 Nov|url=http://archive.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/oct82006/index2044162006107.asp|access-date=4 January 2011|date=8 October 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406020325/http://archive.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/oct82006/index2044162006107.asp|archive-date=6 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=New name for cities|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/from-bangalore-to-bengaluru/article6553314.ece|access-date=1 November 2014|work=The Hindu}}</ref> Belgaum is known as Belgaon (IPA: [[Help:IPA/Marathi|[beːɭɡaːʋ]]]) in Maharashtra and amongst [[Marathi people]].

The [[Belgaum border dispute]] is a dispute involving the Indian states of [[Karnataka]] and [[Maharashtra]]. Belgaum, currently a part of Karnataka and earlier the erstwhile [[Bombay Presidency]], is claimed by Maharashtra on linguistic grounds. In 1956, the States Reorganization Act incorporated the Belgaum district including the 10 taluks in the [[Mysore state]], which became Karnataka in 1973. Though according to the 1881 census, 64.39% of the population of Belgaum were [[Kannada]] speakers and 26.04% spoke [[Marathi language|Marathi]].<ref name="TOI-Dispute"/>

Following this incident, in the following year's election, Prashanta Budavi, wife of KRV (Karnataka Rakshana Vedike) City President Shantinath Budavi was appointed as mayor of the Belgaum City Corporation.
