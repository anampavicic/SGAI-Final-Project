'''Jeju City''' ({{lang-ko|제주시|Jeju-si}}; {{IPA|ko|tɕe̞.dʑu}}) is the [[capital city|capital]] of the [[Jeju Province]] in South Korea and the largest city on [[Jeju Island]]. The city is served by [[Jeju International Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] code CJU).

Located on an island off the [[Korean Peninsula]], Jeju has mild, warm weather during much of the year. The city is a well-known resort, with prestigious hotels and public [[casino]] facilities. In 2011, 9.9 million passengers flew between the two cities of Seoul and Jeju, making the [[Gimpo International Airport|Gimpo]]&ndash;[[Jeju International Airport|Jeju]] route the [[world's busiest passenger air routes|world's busiest passenger air route]].<ref name="JejuET">{{cite web |title=Top flights |url= https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2012/05/daily-chart-8 |work=Daily chart |date=2012-05-14 |publisher=[[The Economist]] |access-date=2012-05-14 |quote=Jeju, on the South Korean island of the same name, is not one of the country's 20 biggest cities. Yet the island's allure as a domestic tourist destination resulted in 9.9m passengers flying between Seoul and Jeju (in either direction) in 2011. This makes it the busiest airline route in the world, according to Amadeus, a company that provides technology to the travel industry.}}</ref>

Jeju welcomes over ten million visitors every year, mainly from the South Korean mainland, Japan, and China.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jeju Island: South Korea's volcanic holiday destination |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/04/16/travel/jeju-island-introduction/ |date=2014-04-17 |publisher=[[CNN]] |access-date=2015-04-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Chinese are buying up South Korea's Jeju Island, and the islanders are not too pleased |url=http://qz.com/259419/the-chinese-are-buying-out-south-koreas-jeju-island-and-the-islanders-are-none-too-pleased/ |date=2014-09-11 |work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |publisher=[[Atlantic Media]] |access-date=2015-04-15}}</ref> The population of Jeju City is 486,604 people and 225,139 households (244,468 men and 245,136 women, May 2024).<ref>{{Cite web |last= |title=제주시홈페이지 |url=https://www.jejusi.go.kr/information/statistics/population.do?mode=detail&notice_id=deb5a1da99934ff3b9c1b226faf8eff4&currentPageNo=1 |access-date=2024-06-14 |website=www.jejusi.go.kr |language=ko}}</ref> The population density is 503.18 (per square km, 2020).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kosis.kr/statHtml/statHtml.do?orgId=110&tblId=DT_11001N_2013_A001&conn_path=I2|title=KOSIS|website=kosis.kr|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref>

==History==
The area of the city has played a central role in Jeju since before recorded history. The [[Samseonghyeol]], holes from which the three ancestors of the Jeju people are said to have come, are located in downtown Jeju City.

During the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule of Korea]], Jeju was renamed to Saishū.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://jgsk.or.kr/_common/do.php?a=full&bidx=212&aidx=2536 | doi=10.14770/jgsk.2014.50.4.457 | date=2014 | volume=50 | issue=4 | last1=Yoon | first1=Sun | title=Tectonic history of Jeju Island | journal=Journal of the Geological Society of Korea }}</ref>

The city has grown quite rapidly since the 1970s. Shin Jeju ({{Korean|labels=no|신제주}}), or "new Jeju", was created some decades ago, up the hill from the airport and houses many government buildings. The thatched roof buildings that were common throughout the city until the 1970s are gradually disappearing.

The city was separated from [[Bukjeju County]] in 1955. However, in 2005 Jeju Province voters approved a proposal to merge the city with Bukjeju County, also merging [[Seogwipo]] with [[Namjeju County]] to create two large cities directly administered by the province. That change was put into effect in July 2006.

In 2012 Sang-Oh Kim became mayor; he was formerly the Jeju regional president of [[National Agricultural Cooperative Federation]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2012-01-29|title='The farmers' mind' is key to accomplishment|url=http://www.headlinejeju.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=139988|access-date=2021-11-15|website=헤드라인제주|language=ko}}</ref>

==Transportation==
Jeju City is the principal transportation center for Jeju Province. It is home to the island's sole airport, [[Jeju International Airport]]; the Jeju-Seoul route is the world's busiest airline route.<ref name="JejuET"/>

In addition, its port is the largest on the island, serving the great majority of passenger and cargo vessels that visit the island. It also stands at the center of the island's road network. To travel throughout the city and island, various buses are available. A bus ride from Jeju City to Seogwipo (the second largest city on the island) is typically an hour.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-03-09|title=How to Get Around Jeju Island with Public Transit|url=https://blog.trazy.com/getting-around-jeju-island-in-south-korea-public-transportation-transport-info/|access-date=2021-11-15|website=Trazy Blog|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Economy==
Due to its central position in transportation, Jeju City sees the main share of tourist traffic to the island. Many tourists arrive at the city through the port terminal or airport, stay in the tourist hotels of the [[Sinjeju]] neighborhood, and stay within the city to visit various Jeju tourist attractions. These include Dragon's Head Rock ({{Ill|Yongduam|ko|용두암}}) along the coast; the [[Samseonghyeol]], three holes in the downtown area; [[Hallasan National Park]] in the interior; the country's tallest mountain, [[Hallasan]]; and world's largest botanical garden, Bunjae Artpia. The 8,500-seat [[Jeju Baseball Stadium]] is near the center of the city.

The city also sells many oranges for which Jeju is famous. Jeju City is surrounded by orange and mandarin farms.<ref>"[https://web.archive.org/web/20100415025041/http://www.jejuair.net/jejuair/company/contact_us.jsp Contact Us]." [[Jeju Air]].

[[Jeju Air]]. Retrieved on 2010-03-05.</ref>

[[Jeju Air]] has its headquarters in Jeju City.

==Geography==
In its former boundaries, Jeju City was 19.3 kilometers from east to west, and 10.2 kilometers from north to south. To the north, it looks across the [[Korea Strait]] at the southern coast of [[South Jeolla Province]]. To the south, it meets [[Seogwipo]] at the top of Hallasan, the island's sole mountain.

== Tourism ==
The [[Jeju Olle Trail]] and [[Jeju Olle Walking Festival]] passes through the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Route 12 |url=https://www.jejuolle.org/trail_en#/road/12 |access-date=2024-07-02 |website=www.jejuolle.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=KTO |first=Korea Tourism Organization |title=Jeju Olle Walking Festival (제주올레걷기축제) : VISITKOREA |url=https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/svc/whereToGo/locIntrdn/locIntrdnList.do?vcontsId=89586 |access-date=2024-06-03 |website=Jeju Olle Walking Festival (제주올레걷기축제) |language=en}}</ref>
