'''Fredrikstad''' ({{IPA-no|ˈfrɛ̀drɪkstɑ|lang|Fredrikstad.ogg}}; previously ''Frederiksstad''; literally "Fredrik's Town") is a [[List of cities in Norway|city]] and [[Municipalities of Norway|municipality]] in [[Østfold]] [[Counties of Norway|county]], Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Fredrikstad.

The city of Fredrikstad was founded in 1567 by [[Frederick II of Denmark|King Frederick II]], and established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see ''[[formannskapsdistrikt]]''). The rural municipality of [[Glemmen]] was merged with Fredrikstad on 1 January 1964. The rural municipalities of [[Borge, Østfold|Borge]], [[Onsøy]], [[Kråkerøy]], and [[Rolvsøy]] were merged with Fredrikstad on 1 January 1994.

The city straddles the river [[Glomma]] where it meets the [[Skagerrak]], about {{convert|20|km|mi}} from the [[Sweden]] border. Along with neighboring [[Sarpsborg]], Fredrikstad forms the fifth largest city in Norway: [[Fredrikstad/Sarpsborg]]. As of 30 September 2021, according to [[Statistics Norway]], these two municipalities have a total population of 141,708 with 83,761 in Fredrikstad and 57,947 in Sarpsborg.

Fredrikstad was built at the mouth of Glomma as a replacement after Sarpsborg ({{convert|15|km|0|abbr=off}} upstream) was burnt down by the [[Swedish Army]] in the 1500s. Some of the citizens stayed behind and rebuilt their old town at its original site and got their city status back in 1839.

The city centre is on the west bank of the Glomma, while the old town on the east bank is Northern Europe's best preserved [[Fredrikstad Fortress|fortified town]].

Fredrikstad used to have a large sawmill industry and was an important [[harbour]] for timber export, then later on [[shipbuilding]], until the main yard was closed in 1988. The main [[Industry (economics)|industries]] are currently various [[chemistry|chemical]] plants and other light industry.

In 2005, Fredrikstad was the final host port for the [[Cutty Sark Tall Ships' Race|Tall Ships' Race]], attracting thousands to the city. In 2019, it was the first host port.

In 2017, Fredrikstad won the national award for most attractive city. The award is given yearly by the Norwegian government on the basis of social, economic and environmental factors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vg.no/i/gM8W1|title=Fredrikstad kåret til Norges mest attraktive by|website=vg.no|language=nb|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref>

==General information==

===Name===
The city was named after the [[Denmark|Danish]] king Frederick II in 1569. The last element ''stad'' means "city".

Prior to 1877, the name was spelled ''Frederiksstad'', then from 1877 to 1888 it was written as ''Fredriksstad'', and finally since 1889 it has been spelled in its current form: ''Fredrikstad''.

===Coat-of-arms===
The [[Coat of arms|coat-of-arms]] is from modern times. They were granted on 21 April 1967. The old arms are based on the oldest known seal of the city, which dates from 1610. They showed a [[fortress]] being guarded by a bear. Strangely, Fredrikstad had no fortifications in 1610 (it received some at the end of the 17th century). Fredrikstad was founded by citizens of Sarpsborg and both the fortress and the bear are taken from the old arms of Sarpsborg. The composition of the seal was also used as arms since the beginning of the 19th century. The new arms were granted at the 400th anniversary of the city in 1967 and show a more modern variation on the fortress and bear.<ref>{{cite web|author=Norske Kommunevåpen|year=1990|title=Nye kommunevåbener i Norden|url=http://www.ngw.nl/int/nor/f/fredriks.htm|access-date=2008-12-13}}</ref>

==History==
After [[Sarpsborg]] was burned to the ground during the [[Northern Seven Years' War]], the ruling king, [[Frederik II of Denmark|Frederik II]], decided by [[royal decree]] to rebuild the city {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} south of the original location. This new site's proximity to the sea and the accessible open land surrounding it made it a better location than the old one. The name Fredrikstad was first used in a letter from the King dated 6 February 1569. The temporary fortification built during the [[Hannibal War]] (1644–1645) between [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark-Norway]], became permanent in the 1660s.

The work on the fortifications was first led by [[Willem Coucheron]] and later [[Johan Caspar von Cicignon]]. During the next 60 years, several fortifications at the [[Fredrikstad Fortress]] were built, including Isegran, Kongsten, and Cicignon. In 1735, a suburb on the western side of Glomma, ''Vestsiden'', was founded. This part later grew faster than
the old city, and became the dominant city centre. Most of the buildings in the old city burned down during a fire in 1764.

In the 1840s, timber exporting from Fredrikstad started to gain momentum. In the 1860s, several steam powered saws were built along the river, and in 1879 the railway reached Fredrikstad, leading to further growth. With the decline of the timber exports as a result of the modernization of wood-processing industries in the early 1900s, Fredrikstad's production changed to other types of products. It later became one of Norway's most important industrial centres, famous for its large [[shipyard]], [[Fredrikstad Mekaniske Verksted]].

== Education ==
Fredrikstad has three high schools. [[Frederik II Upper Secondary School]] offers general studies and financial / administrative studies. It is a merger of the former {{ill|Frydenberg Gymnastic|no|Fredrikstad høiere almenskole}} and Christianslund Handelsgymnasium. {{ill|Glemmen High School|no|Glemmen videregående skole}} offers professional training and study. {{ill|Wang Toppidrett Frederikstad|no|WANG Toppidrett Fredrikstad}} offers sports, science, languages, social sciences and economics. In addition, there is a [[Waldorf education|Steiner]] school, a [[Private school|private]] educational alternative.

[[Østfold University College]] offers higher education (master's and bachelor's studies) at the Academy of Performing Arts, Faculty of Health and Social Care and the Faculty of Engineering at Kråkerøy. {{ill|Østfold Vocational College|no|Østfold fagskole}} offers short professional craft or technical courses. The Department of Journalism offers primarily continuing education for journalists and editors.

==Fredrikstad Museum==
Fredrikstad Museum is located in Old Fredrikstad. The museum shows the history of the city and the surrounding region. The museum also manages Elingaard Manor in Onsøy and Torgauten Fort. Fredrikstad Museum was founded in 1903. Since 2003, the museum's management has been located in Tøihuset in Old Town.<ref>[http://ostfoldmuseene.no/museene/fredrikstad_museum/ ''Fredrikstad museum'' (Østfoldmuseene Org)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403080018/http://ostfoldmuseene.no/museene/fredrikstad_museum/ |date=3 April 2015 }}</ref>

==Sport==
Fredrikstad is home to nine-time Norway football winners [[Fredrikstad FK]] who play at the [[Fredrikstad Stadion]]. [[Egil Olsen]], manager for the Norwegian national football team, is from Fredrikstad.<ref name=Olsen>{{cite web |url=https://www.bdfutbol.com/en/l/l98779.html |title=Olsen: Manager |website=BDFutbol |access-date=28 March 2021 }}</ref> There is also an American football team, the Fredrikstad Eagles.

Fredrikstad has a [[REMA 1000-ligaen (women's handball)|top-division]] handball team, [[Fredrikstad BK]], and a [[Eliteserien (ice hockey)|top-division]] ice hockey team, [[Stjernen Hockey]].

The city also has a number of [[floorball]] teams, including [[Slevik IBK]], Fredrikstad IBK and St. Croix Pirates.
