== Geography ==
[[File:Dharan.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|300x300px|Dharan top view]]
Dharan is situated on the foothills of the [[Mahabharat Range]] in the north with its southern tip touching the edge of the [[Terai]] region at an altitude of 1148&nbsp;ft (349m).  Dharan bazaar grew up near Phusre where the old walking route to Dhankuta and a large part of the Eastern hills left the plains with the ascent of Sanghuri Danra.  In the days when villagers in the hills made their annual trek to sell and buy goods this was a natural location for a market where hills and Terai met.  In 1952 the construction of the Kosi barrage began and a narrow gauge railway was built to take stone from Phusre loaded at a locality now known as "Railway" to the site of the barrage near the Indian Border.<ref>Benson. J. (1975) The Kosi Project Railway, Industrial Railway Society Record no 6, August, pp 65-71. Industrial Railway Society, Greenford, Middlesex, UK.</ref> The [[Koshi Highway|Koshi highway]] runs through the heart of the city thus connecting it with the provincial capital of [[Biratnagar]] as well as the [[Itahari]] junction of the east–west [[Mahendra Highway|Mahendra highway]] (lying 41&nbsp;km and 17&nbsp;km south, respectively), and the Nepal-China border of [[Kimathanka]] (lying 115&nbsp;km north).  The road from Biratnagar was originally built and surfaced in connection with the building of Gopher Camp for the British Gurkhas.  The road from Dharan to Dhankuta was financed by the UK and largely completed by 1982.<ref>DDRP web site: http://www.ddrp.co.uk/about/history.htm</ref>

==History==

Dharan was the capital town of lowland [[Limbuwan]] kingdom of [[Morang]]. It was ruled by [[Limbu people|Limbu]] King [[Buddhi Karna Raya Khebang]]. King Buddhikarna Khebang was the descendant of the ruler King Muray Hang Khebang of Phedap Kingdom . Since 1584 AD till 1774 AD, [[Dharan]]-Bijaypur was the capital city of [[Morang District|Morang]] Kingdom of [[Limbuwan]]. It was also effective capital of the entire Limbuwan region or  [[Limbu people|Ten Limbu Kingdoms]]  which was also known as Pallo Kirat . Thus, in August 1774, the [[Gorkha]] King [[Prithivi Narayan Shah]]'s representatives [[Abhiman Singh Basnet]], Parath Bhandari, Kirti Singh Khawas and Bali Baniya met the ministers of Morang state and agreed to come to good terms with the [[Gorkha| Gorkha Kingdom]]  and accept the Gorkhali king as [[Maharaja]] and that in return the kingdom of Gorkha would retain the right of [[self-government]] of [[Limbu people|Limbu]] rulers in their kingdoms.

City, which is connected with the historical importance of Bijaypur started its development since 1985 BS. Then Prime minister  [[Chandra Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana]] established Chandra nagar (now purano bazaar) and primeminister [[Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana]]
established Juddha nagar (now naya bazaar). City abstracted its name after "[[Dharan]]" (nepali word) a rectangular hollow dug under the ground and a low platform upon it for sawing logs with a big saw; one person on the platform and other below it. And, after the establishment of Dharan city, logs used to be widely split up here in "Dharan". It took its present shape when Bijaypur village panchayat and Ghopa village panchayat were merged into Dharan municipality in 2035 BS.
