'''Mekelle''' ({{langx|ti|መቐለ}}), or '''Mek'ele''', is a [[List of zones of Ethiopia|special zone]] and [[capital city|capital]] of the [[Tigray Region]] of [[Ethiopia]]. Mekelle was formerly the capital of [[Enderta province|Enderta]] [[Awrajja|awraja]] in [[Tigray Province|Tigray]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Mäqälä|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag|location=Wiesbaden|last=Aberra|first=Yohannes|date=2007|editor-last=Uhlig|editor-first=Siegbert}}</ref> It is located around {{Convert|780|km|mi}} north of the Ethiopian capital [[Addis Ababa]], with an elevation of {{Convert|2254|m|ft}} above sea level. Administratively, Mekelle is considered a Special Zone, which is divided into seven sub-cities. It is the economic, cultural, and political hub of northern Ethiopia.

Mekelle has grown rapidly since 1991 with a population of 61,000 in 1984, 97,000 inhabitants in 1994 (96.5% being Tigrinya-speakers), and 170,000 in 2006 (i.e. 4% of the population of Tigray). Mekelle is the second-largest city in Ethiopia after [[Addis Ababa]], with a population of around 545,000.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mekelle Population 2021 |title=World Population Review |url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/mekele-population |website=World Population review}}</ref> It is 4 times larger than [[Adigrat]], the second-largest regional center. The majority of the population of Mekelle depends on government employment, commerce, and small-scale enterprises. In 2007, Mekelle had new engineering, cement, and textile factories, producing for the local and foreign markets. [[Mekelle University]] developed out of the pre-1991 Arid Agricultural College, and about a dozen other governmental and private colleges were created.<ref name=":1" />

==History==
{{Main article|Timeline of Mekelle}}

===Origins===
Mekelle is believed to have evolved from a 13th-century hamlet called Enda Meseqel (later Enda Medhane Alem), becoming a town by the early 19th century, when ''ras'' [[Wolde Selassie]] of [[Enderta Province|Enderta]] made [[Antalo]] his seat of power, and the region of Mekelle ({{Convert|40|km|mi}} to the north) his recreational center.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Salt, Trade and Urbanization: the Story of Mäqälä Town, 1872-1935|last=Taddesse|first=Madhane|publisher=Addis Ababa University|year=1995|location=Addis Ababa}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=የመቀሌ ከመሰራረትና እድገት|last=Sakkwar|first=Taddese|year=2000|location=Mekelle|trans-title=Foundation and Growth of Mäqälä Town}}</ref> In the tax records of ''atse'' [[Tewodros II]], Mekelle appears as a tributary district within Enderta with a ''negarit'' of its own.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tax Records of and Inventories of Emperor Tewodros of Ethiopia, 1855-1868|last1=Asfaw|first1=Girmaselassie|last2=Pankhurst|first2=Richard|publisher=University of London|year=1979|isbn=0728600579|location=London}}</ref>

=== 19th century ===
The credit for Mekelle's growth into a regional capital goes to ''atse'' [[Yohannes IV]] who made Mekelle political capital of his expanding state. He must have chosen the place for its strategic proximity both to rich agricultural areas (of [[Raya Azebo]]) and to the [[Afar Region|Afar]] salt country. Mekelle's position on the route to [[Shewa]], the power base of Yohannes's main rival [[Menelik II|Menelik]] could have been another factor. Three institutions still important for modern Mekelle were founded by Yohannes. The grand palace built in 1882–84 by the Tigrayan engineer Engedashet Kassa Sehul (takes as an example the construction technique of other buildings present in the [[Tigray Region|Tigrai]] at the time of the [[Kingdom of Aksum|Axumite kingdom]] and the buildings of the peasants and sacred churches of the Tigrai) and forms the historic center of Mekelle. The large market Edaga Senuy ("Monday Market"). The church, at Debre Gennet Medhane Alem, built after the return from Raya Azebo campaign in 1871.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/145777879.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2020-08-09 |archive-date=2019-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190418041827/https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/145777879.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|doi = 10.3130/jaabe.10.343|title = Deterioration of Heritage by Informal Urbanization in Mekelle, Ethiopia|year = 2011|last1 = Okazaki|first1 = Rumi|journal = Journal of Asian Architecture and Building Engineering|volume = 10|issue = 2|pages = 343–350|s2cid = 109528178|doi-access = free}}</ref><ref>http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/es/201961468257059831/pdf/E18440V120AFR00Box385213B00PUBLIC0.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref>[[File:Enda_Yesus_(Church_of_Jesus)_Fort,_Mek'ele,_Ethiopia,_ca._1890.JPG|thumb|Fort of Enda Eyesus (c. 1890)|left]]

In the 1880s, Mekelle became Ethiopia's capital city. Among the factors that further accelerated Mekele's growth and urbanization were the establishment of residential quarters by the "nobility" and court servants, the prominence of the ''amole'' salt market and the subsequent establishment of local and foreign trading and occupational communities, and Mekelle's strategic position as a transit center for commodities of the long-distance trade routes of northeastern Ethiopia, attached to the Red Sea ports, and to northern and central Ethiopia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gebrelibanos|first=Tsegay|date=2009|title=The Ethiopian Salt Trading System in the 20th Century: A View from Mäqäla, Northern Ethiopia|journal=Proceedings of the 16th International Conference of Ethiopian Studies|pages=185–201}}</ref> By establishing a market in Mekelle, Yohannes could draw on the northern trade routes as well as the salt caravan routes to the town, capitalizing on his political leverage.<ref name=":0" />

The succession of ''atse'' [[Menelik II]] of Shewa signaled a trading reorientation from northern to southern Ethiopia (centered in Shewa). The new capital Addis Ababa quickly outstripped Mekelle, which, however, retained its political importance as the district and regional administration center of Enderta and [[Tigray Province|Tigray]] respectively through the 20th century, and its economic role in the Ethiopian salt trade.

During the Italian War of 1895–96, Mekelle became an important site in the conflict. After the fall of [[Adwa]] in spring 1895, ''ras'' [[Ras Mengesha Yohannes|Mengasha Yohannes]] retreated from his father's capital Mekelle following the advice of ''atse'' Menelik II. Mekelle was occupied by the Italians without a shot and integrated into the ''Colonia Eritrea''; from here the Italians extended their occupation south, up to Ambalage.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gl'Italiani in Africa: l'assedio di Macallè|last=Montegazza|first=Vico|publisher=Successori Le Monnier|year=1896|location=Firenze}}</ref> The Italian army established their fort near the Enda Eyesus church above Mekelle in October 1895. After the re-occupation of Ambalage in late 1895, the fort was besieged by Ethiopian troops, who cut the Italians' water supply. When the Italians surrendered in January 1896, Menelik allowed them to retreat to their stronghold [[Adigrat]], probably hoping to prevent an escalation of the conflict, and he appointed his own governor over Enderta at Mekelle, ''dejazmach'' Tedla Abaguben, in order to check the rebellious Tigrayan princes.

=== 20th century ===
{{Further|Tigray People's Liberation Front}}
[[File:Depiction of Mussolini in Mekelle.jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[Benito Mussolini]] in Mekelle in November 1935]]
Three historical epochs sustained Mekelle's urbanization in the 20th century. The first was the advent of ''dejazmach'' Abreha Araya Demtsu, governor of Eastern Tigray with Mekelle as his capital. Abreha imitated his cousin Yohannes by establishing his own splendid palace (now the Hotel called Abreha Castle) on a hill facing the grand palace, a new Saturday Market (Edaga Senbet), and a new church, Selassie, all of which were situated to the south of Mekelle proper. Likewise, he attracted various occupational groups including Muslim traders, women service vendors, and army retainers. Consequently, in the 1920s and early 1930s, Mekelle witnessed a remarkable growth in trade. ''Dejazmach'' [[Haile Selassie Gugsa]] renovated the Palace in the center to use it as his seat.

The second phase occurred during the Italian occupation (1935–41). The Italians, who occupied the town in November 1935, contributed considerably to its modernization. They built a military airport and a fort at Enda Eyesus (now the main compound of [[Mekelle University]]); reorganized roads, telephone lines, offices and residences; and installed modern water pipelines, electricity, clinics, postal services, cinema hall and resort/sport centers. They also expanded Edaga Senbet by introducing corrugated iron shops. This also attracted foreign entrepreneurs (Greeks, Arabs and Armenians). Mekelle, then divided into two zones; Italian and Native, grew about twice its former size. In 1938, there were shops, two Italian-style restaurants and Hotel Amba Aradam with four rooms. There were post, telephone, and telegraph offices, and a hospital. An important market was held on Mondays.<ref name="guida">{{cite book |last1=Consociazione turistica Italiana |title=Guida dell'Africa orientale Italiana |location=Milano |page=302|url=http://www.petitesondes.net/Guida-AOI.htm}}</ref>

Starting from May 1943, Mekelle was in the hands of the leaders of the [[Woyane rebellion]] against the then weak restored Haile Selassie government. British air bombardment of the town of September–October caused heavy damage. In October Mekelle was recaptured by the Ethiopian government forces.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Dying Lion: Feudalism and Modernization in Ethiopia|last=Gilkes|first=Patrick|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1975|location=London|pages=180, 188}}</ref>

The third phase in Mekelle's urban development took place mainly during 1942–74. Modern urban sectors were diversified, and new administrative offices were established. The Mekelle municipality (founded 1942), telecommunications and post office, Commercial Bank and the ''atse'' Yohannes Elementary (in 1952) and Secondary School (in 1960) were established. The master plan was issued in 1962. Small-scale enterprises such as oil refineries, soap mills, leather and caning bags, costumes and flour mills were established until 1974. Most of the industrial establishments, however, have declined, degraded or closed during the [[Ethiopian Civil War]] (1974-1991).

During the [[1983–85 famine in Ethiopia]], Mekelle was notorious for the seven "hunger camps" around the city. These housed 75,000 refugees with 20,000 more waiting to enter. During March 1985, 50 to 60 people died in these seven camps every day. In February 1986, the [[Tigray People's Liberation Front]] (TPLF) released 1,800 political prisoners from the Mekelle prison in a daring military action. The operation was named ''Agazi,'' after one of the founding fighters of the TPLF, who had been killed in the second year of the [[Ethiopian Civil War]].

In a series of offensives launched on 25 February 1988, TPLF fighters bypassed Mekelle but took control of [[Maychew]], [[Korem]] and other places along the Dessie-Mekelle road. By June 1988, TPLF controlled all of Tigray except the city of Mekelle and the territory a radius of {{Convert|15|km|mi}} around the city. In response, the Derg had a number of villages around Mekelle burned on June 4 and 5, which included Addi Gera, Bahri, Goba Zena, Grarot, Issala, and Rabea. It was not until 25 February 1989 that Mekelle was also occupied by the TPLF, after the government position in Tigray had collapsed. Near the end of the civil war, Mekelle was bombed by the [[Ethiopian Air Force]] on 27 and 29 October 1989, resulting in the deaths of at least 31 people.<ref>Human Rights Watch, 24 July 1991: [https://www.hrw.org/reports/archives/africa/ETHIOPIA907.htm ETHIOPIA - "Mengistu has Decided to Burn Us like Wood" - Bombing of Civilians and Civilian Targets by the Air Force]</ref>

On 5 June 1998, the [[Eritrea]]n Air Force bombed Ayder School in Mekelle during the [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War|Eritrean–Ethiopian War]] killing twelve. A monument pays respects to this tragedy.

On 29 December 2002, a riot broke out between [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] and [[Adventism|Adventist]] worshippers, over an Adventist prayer service being conducted in a stadium. Some Ethiopian Orthodox believers, upset by the display of public Adventist preaching, reportedly sparked the clashes by first throwing stones at Adventists gathered in the stadium, then by looting Adventist offices in the city. [[Law enforcement in Ethiopia|Police]] intervened to break up the riots, which resulted in five dead and three seriously injured. The police reported that 10 people were detained, but independent sources reported that the number was much larger.

The [[United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea]] (UNMEE) headquarters was established in Mekelle in 2000 following the end of the Eritrean–Ethiopian War and continued until 30 July 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unmee.unmissions.org/|title=UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea is withdrawn|date=30 July 2008|website=UNMEE|access-date=29 September 2018}}</ref>

During the [[Tigray War]], attacks [[Mekelle offensive|were carried out on Mekelle]] by joint Ethiopian and Eritrean forces, including aerial bombardments. On 19 December 2020, an [[EEPA]] report stated that Eritrean soldiers were in Mekelle, according to a resident and two diplomats receiving information from the ground. They stated that some soldiers were wearing Eritrean uniforms, whilst others wore Ethiopian uniforms but "spoke Tigrinya with an Eritrean accent and drove trucks without license plates."<ref name="eepa31">[https://www.eepa.be//wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Situation-Report-EEPA-Horn-No.-31-20-December.docx.pdf Situation Report EEPA HORN No. 31 - 20 December] Europe External Programme with Africa</ref> On 19 December 2020, there were multiple reports that the [[Ethiopian National Defence Force]] (ENDF) were looting property from the [[Sur Company]] in Mekelle and transporting the loot to Addis Ababa.<ref name="eepa31" /> On the same day, police and TPLF absence led to lawlessness in Mekelle. Youth were especially targeted by ENDF soldiers. Civil servants in Mekelle were ordered back to work by the [[Transitional Government of Tigray]]; few reported to work.<ref name="eepa31" /> On 20 December 2020, witnesses from Mekelle stated that artillery shelling had taken place before 28 November. The shelling destroyed houses in residential areas and killed civilians. In one case, a whole family was killed, leaving only a little boy alive. A doctor said that he personally saw 22 bodies. It was hard to take proper care of those wounded by the artillery due to a critical shortage of medical supplies.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55325603 Ethiopia's Tigray crisis: 'How we survived when Mekelle was shelled'] BBC, 20 December 2020</ref> Four planned [[Ethiopian Airlines]] flights from [[Addis Ababa]] to Mekelle were cancelled on 20 December.<ref name="eepa32">[https://www.eepa.be//wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Situation-Report-EEPA-Horn-No.-32-21-December.docx.pdf Situation Report EEPA HORN No. 32 - 21 December] Europe External Programme with Africa</ref> On 21 December 2020, Federal Police Crime Prevention Sector Head, Deputy Commissioner General Melaku Fanta, told local media in Mekelle that arrest warrants have been issued against anyone who collaborated with the [[TPLF]].<ref name="eepa33">[https://www.eepa.be//wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Situation-Report-EEPA-Horn-No.-33-22-December.pdf Situation Report EEPA HORN No. 33 - 22 December] Europe External Programme with Africa</ref> On 28 June 2021 Mekelle was recaptured by the [[Tigray Defense Forces]].<ref>[https://www.theafricareport.com/102921/ethiopia-tigray-rebels-enter-regional-capital-of-mekelle-as-officials-flee/ Ethiopia: Tigray rebels enter regional capital of Mekelle, ceasefire requested], 28 June 2021</ref>

==Geography==
Mekelle lies at an elevation of {{Convert|2254|m|ft}} above sea level (at the airport), close to the edge of the northern portion of the Ethiopian Rift Valley, on a Jurassic limestone plateau, in a semi-arid area with a mean annual rainfall of {{Convert|714|mm|in}}.<ref>Britannica,

=== Sub-cities ===

[[File:Mekele.webp|thumb|Dejen Street in Mekelle in 2021]]
Mekelle is divided into seven local administrations: Hawelti, Adi-Haki, Kedamay Weyane, Hadnet, Ayder, Semien and [[Quiha]]. Within each local administration there are ''kebeles'' or ''ketenas''. The subcities of Mekelle comprise the area formerly incorporated as Mekelle City. While falling under the jurisdiction of Mekele Special Zone Government, each subcity is also a borough with its own administrator, like other cities of Ethiopia. These officials oversee socio-economic development and run health, education, and utilities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Popular Participation in Decentralized Governance|last=Habtu|first=Adonay|publisher=Mekelle University|year=2011|location=Mekelle|pages=29}}</ref>

The sub-cities differ from other cities in having a unique administrative relationship with the regional government. Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the Mekelle Government. To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city. The "three central sub-cities" of Mekelle – Kedamay Weyane, Ayder and Hawelti – are the business core of the city, with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population. Semien is unique occupied by many major factories. It is often called the "economic center" of the Tigray.

Mekelle special zone has been represented in the [[House of Peoples' Representatives]] by Addis Alem Balema since 2005.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Democracy and Economic Development in Ethiopia|last=Balema|first=Addis|publisher=Red Sea Press|year=2014|isbn=9781569023907|location=Trenton}}</ref>

== Climate ==
The climate in this area is characterized by moderately warm temperatures year-round and distinct [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s. The [[Köppen Climate Classification|Köppen]] type for this climate is [[cool semi-arid climate]] (''BSk''); however it borders on both a [[subtropical highland climate]] (''Cwb'') and a [[hot semi-arid climate]] (''BSh'').
