Archeological evidence suggests the site of the present city was settled by [[Cossacks|Cossack]] communities from at least 1524. '''Yekaterinoslav''' ("glory of Catherine")<ref name="Cybriwsky History of the Dnipro"/> was established by decree of the [[Emperor of all the Russias|Russian Empress]] [[Catherine the Great]] in 1787 as the administrative center of [[Novorossiya Governorate|Novorossiya]]. From the end of the 19th century, the town attracted foreign capital and an international, multi-ethnic workforce exploiting [[Kryvbas]] iron ore and [[Donbas]] coal.

Renamed ''Dnipropetrovsk'' in 1926 after the Ukrainian [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] leader [[Grigory Petrovsky]], it became a focus for the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] commitment to the rapid development of heavy industry. After [[World War II]], this included [[Nuclear power|nuclear]], [[Arms industry|arms]], and [[Soviet space program|space]] industries whose strategic importance led to Dnipropetrovsk's designation as a [[closed city]].

Following the [[Euromaidan]] events of 2014, the city politically shifted away from pro-Russian parties and figures towards those favoring closer ties with the European Union. As a result of [[Decommunization in Ukraine|decommunization]], the city was renamed ''Dnipro'' in 2016. Following the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russian invasion of Ukraine]] in February 2022, Dnipro rapidly developed as a logistical hub for humanitarian aid and a reception point for people fleeing the various battle fronts.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |last=Sullivan |first=Becky |date=29 March 2022 |title=With front lines on 3 sides, Ukraine's Dnipro sharpens its focus on the war |language=en |work=NPR.org |url=https://www.npr.org/2022/03/29/1089146927/russia-war-ukraine-dnipro?t=1649159481082 |access-date=2022-04-05}}</ref><ref name="meduzaDniproFeb232023">{{cite web |title=Dispatch from Dnipro How 'Ukraine's outpost' and its people are faring after one year of all-out war|url=https://meduza.io/en/feature/2023/02/23/dispatch-from-dnipro|website=[[Meduza]]|date=February 23, 2023|access-date=2023-04-11}}</ref>

In the 17th century the city was also known as '''Polovytsia'''.<ref>Mikhail Levchenko.

In 1918, the [[Central Council of Ukraine]] of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] proposed to change the name of the city to ''Sicheslav''; however, this was never finalised.<ref>[http://ukrweekly.com/uwwp/rada-approves-historic-bills-to-part-with-soviet-legacy/ Rada approves historic bills to part with Soviet legacy], [[The Ukrainian Weekly]] (17 April 2015)</ref>

In 1926 the city was renamed after [[communist]] leader [[Grigory Petrovsky]].<ref name=decommupbbcU>[http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2015/05/15/7068057/ Poroshenko signed the laws about decomunization].

The 2015 [[decommunization in Ukraine|law on decommunization]] required the city to be renamed.<ref name=decommupbbcU/> On 29 December 2015 the city council officially changed the reference of the city naming from referring to Petrovsky to being in honor of [[Saint Peter]],<ref>[http://lb.ua/news/2015/12/29/324750_dnepropetrovsk_sobirayutsya.html LB.ua], ''Днепропетровск собираются "переименовать" в честь Святого Петра (Dnepropetrovsk to be "renamed" in honour of St. Peter)'', 29 December 2015.</ref> thus making the name consistent with the law without actually changing the name itself.

On 3 February 2016 a draft law was registered in the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (the Ukrainian parliament) to change the name of the city to ''Dnipro''.<ref>{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2016/02/3/7097661 In Rada registered a bill to rename Dnipropetrovsk], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (3 February 2016)</ref> On 19 May 2016 the Ukrainian parliament passed a bill to officially rename the city (to ''Dnipro'').

Following the renaming of the city the reference to Petrovsky has been removed from institutions named after the city. A notable exception is the name of the surrounding province, which is listed in the territorial structure of Ukraine in [[Constitution of Ukraine|the Constitution]].<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/ukraine/ Ukraine], [[The World Factbook]], as accessed on 9 February 2023</ref> Thus until a lengthy and complicated process of amending is carried out, it officially retains the name [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]].

==== Establishment of Catherine's city ====
The first written mention of a town in the [[Russian Empire]] called Yekaterinoslav can be found in a report from [[Azov Governorate|Azov Governor]] [[Vasily Chertkov]] to [[Grigory Potemkin]] on 23 April 1776. He wrote "The provincial city called Yekaterinoslav should be the best convenience on the right side of the [[Dnieper River]] near [[Kodak Fortress|Kaydak]]..." (Which referred to {{ill|New Kodak|uk|Нові Кодаки}}). In 1777, a town named Yekaterinoslav (''the glory of Catherine''),<ref name="Cybriwsky History of the Dnipro"/> was built to the north of the present-day city at the confluence of the [[Samara River (Dnieper)|Samara]] and Kilchen rivers. The site was badly chosen – spring waters transformed the city into a bog.<ref name="eugene">{{cite web |url=http://www.eugene.com.ua/dnepr.html |title=www.eugene.com.ua Dnepropetrovsk History |publisher=Eugene.com.ua |access-date=28 November 2014}}</ref><ref name="ukrssr2"/> The surviving settlement was later renamed [[Novomoskovsk, Ukraine|Novomoskovsk]].<ref name="midnipromuseumnovyjkodak"/><ref name="ReferenceA">S.

The territory of modern Dnipro, despite the modern-day city's size, still has not expanded to encompass the territory of (Chertkov's) Yekaterinoslav of 1776.<ref name="ukrainianweek198459"/> On 22 January 1784 [[Russian Emperor|Russian Empress]] [[Catherine the Great]] signed an Imperial Ukase directing that "the gubernatorial city under name of Yekaterinoslav be moved to the right bank of the [[Dnieper]] river near Kodak".

While into the late nineteenth century the principal business of the town remained the processing of agricultural raw materials,<ref name="ukrssr2"/> there was an early state-sponsored effort to promote manufacture. In 1794 the government supported two factories: a textile factory that was transferred from the town of Dubrovny [[Mogilev Governorate]] and a silk-stockings factory that was brought from the village of Kupavna near Moscow. In 1797 the textile factory employed 819 permanent workers, 378 of whom were women and 115 children. The silk stocking workers, the majority being women, were serfs bought at an auction for 16,000 roubles. Conditions, as Potemkin himself was forced to admit, were harsh, with many of the workers dying from malnutrition and exhaustion.<ref name="ukrssr2"/>

From 1797 to 1802, while serving under the Emperor [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] as the administrative centre of a centre of the [[Novorossiya Governorate#Second establishment|Novorossiya Governorate]], the settlement was officially known as ''Novorossiysk.''<ref name="dnipropetrovshina-istorichna-dovidka"/><ref name="ukrssr2"/>

The formal tenure of the UPR was brief: on 29 April 1918 intervention by the [[Central Powers]] saw the UPR replaced by the more pliant [[Ukrainian State]] or [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate]].

In 1924 a Provincial [[Congress of Soviets]] adopted a resolution on renaming the city of Yekaterinoslav to the city of Krasnodniprovsk (and [[Yekaterinoslav Governorate]] to Krasnodniprovsk).

The city figured prominently in [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s [[Five-year plans of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plans]] for industrialisation. In 1932, Dnipropetrovsk's regional metallurgical plants produced 20 per cent of the entire cast iron and 25 per cent of the steel manufactured in the Ukrainian SSR. By the end of the thirties the Dnipropetrovsk region became the most urbanised of Soviet Ukraine with more than 2,273,000 people living in the region and over half a million in the city proper.

As early as July 1944, the State Committee of Defence in Moscow decided to build a large military machine-building factory in Dnipropetrovsk on the location of the pre-war aircraft plant. In December 1945, thousands of German [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] began construction and built the first sections and shops in the new factory.

According to [[KGB]] reports, in the 1960s "[[Samizdat]]" and [[Ukrainian diaspora]] publications began to circulate via [[Western Ukraine]] in Dnipropetrovsk. These fed into underground student circles where they promoted interest in the "[[Sixtiers#Ukrainian Sixtiers|Ukrainian Sixtiers]]", in [[Ukrainian history]], especially of [[Ukrainian Cossack]]s, and in the revival of the [[Ukrainian language]].

In the wake of the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]] on 24 February 2022, and with developing military fronts near [[Kyiv]] and to the [[Northern Ukraine campaign|north]], [[Eastern Ukraine offensive|east]] and [[Southern Ukraine campaign|south]], Dnipro has become a logistical hub for humanitarian aid and a reception point for people fleeing the war. Roughly equidistant from the war's major theatres in the [[Eastern Ukraine campaign|east]] and the [[Southern Ukraine campaign|south]], the city's location is proving critical for supplying the Ukrainian defence effort.{{citation needed|date=September 2023}} At the same time, its control of a [[Dnieper River]] crossing and the opportunity it would provide to cut off Ukrainian forces in the [[Donbas]] makes the city a high-value target for the Russians.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Націлився на Дніпро: названо нову ймовірну мету кремлівського фюрера в Україні |url=https://ukrainenews.fakty.ua/399367-nacelilsya-na-dnepr-nazvana-novaya-veroyatnaya-cel-kremlevskogo-fyurera-v-ukraine |access-date=2022-04-05 |website=ukrainenews.fakty.ua |language=uk|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220406074849/https://ukrainenews.fakty.ua/399367-nacelilsya-na-dnepr-nazvana-novaya-veroyatnaya-cel-kremlevskogo-fyurera-v-ukraine|archive-date=6 April 2022}}</ref>

Dnipro is reported as the only city in Ukraine where a volunteer formation has been created under direct City Council control. It is called the "Dnieper Guard" (Варти Дніпра, Varty Dnipra). The mayor of Dnipro, [[Borys Filatov]] has dismissed suggestions that the group remained [[Ihor Kolomoyskyi]]'s "private army". Kolomoyskyi has helped with some equipment purchases, but the force performs defence and law and order functions under the leadership of the [[National Police of Ukraine|national police]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Горбань |first=Аліна |date=5 April 2022 |title=В університеті у Дніпрі розпочали тренінг домедичної підготовки |url=https://suspilne.media/225425-u-dnipropetrovskomu-universiteti-rozpocali-trening-domedicnoi-dopomogi-v-umovah-vijni/? |access-date=2022-04-05 |website=Суспільне {{!}} Новини |language=uk}}</ref>

== Government and politics ==
=== Government ===
{{see also|City of regional significance (Ukraine)|Dnipro#Politics}}
The City of Dnipro is governed by the Dnipro City Council. It is a city municipality that is designated as a separate district within its oblast.

Administratively, the city is divided into [[Urban districts of Ukraine|urban districts]]. Presently, there are 8 of them. [[Aviatorske]], a rural settlement located near the [[Dnipro International Airport]], is also a part of [[Dnipro urban hromada]].

The City Council Assembly makes up the administration's legislative branch, thus effectively making it a city 'parliament' or rada. The municipal council is made up of 12 elected members, who are each elected to represent a certain district of the city for a four-year term. The council has 29 standing commissions which play an important role in the oversight of the city and its merchants.

Until 18 July 2020, Dnipro was incorporated as a [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]], the centre of Dnipro Municipality and extraterritorial administrative centre of [[Dnipro Raion]]. The municipality was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast to seven. The area of Dnipro Municipality was merged into Dnipro Raion.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Про утворення та ліквідацію районів.

Dnipro is also the seat of the oblast's local administration controlled by the [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]] [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Council|Rada]]. The [[Governor of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]] is appointed by the [[President of Ukraine]].

==Geography==
[[File:Dniepropetrowsk z lotu ptaka.jpg|thumb|An aerial view of Dnipro. The [[Dnieper River]], city's left and right banks, and a number of bridges can be seen.]]

The city is built mainly upon both banks of the Dnieper, at its confluence with the [[Samara River (Dnieper)|Samara River]]. In the loop of a major meander, the Dnieper changes its course from the north west to continue southerly and later south-westerly through Ukraine, ultimately passing [[Kherson]], where it finally flows into the [[Black Sea]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Nowadays both the north and south banks play home to a range of industrial enterprises and manufacturing plants. The airport is located about {{cvt|15|km|1}} south-east of the city.

The centre of the city is constructed on the right bank which is part of the [[Dnieper Upland]], while the left bank is part of the [[Dnieper Lowland]]. The old town is situated atop a hill that is formed as a result of the river's change of course to the south. The change of river's direction is caused by its proximity to the [[Azov Upland]] located southeast of the city.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

One of the city's streets, Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt, links the two major architectural ensembles of the city and constitutes an important thoroughfare through the centre, which along with various suburban radial road systems, provides some of the area's most vital transport links for both suburban and inter-urban travel.

===Climate===

Under the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen–Geiger climate classification system]], Dnipro has a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa/Dfb'').<ref name=Peel>{{cite journal |author1=Peel, M.

The city has four distinct seasons: a cold, snowy winter; a hot summer; and two relatively wet transition periods. However, according to other schemes (such as the Salvador Rivas-Martínez bioclimatic one), Dnipro has a Supratemperate bioclimate, and belongs to the Temperate xeric steppic thermoclimatic belt, due to high [[evapotranspiration]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalbioclimatics.org/form/maps.htm |title=Bioclimatic & Biogeographic Maps of Europe |last=Rivas-Martínez |first=Salvador |year=2004 |publisher=University of León |access-date=1 May 2017}}</ref>

During the summer, Dnipro is very warm (average day temperature in July is {{cvt|24|to|28|C}}, even hot sometimes {{cvt|32|to|36|C}}). Temperatures as high as {{cvt|36|C|0}} have been recorded in May. Winter is not so cold (average day temperature in January is {{cvt|-4|to|0|C}}, but when there is no snow and the wind blows hard, it feels extremely cold. A mix of snow and rain happens usually in December.

The best time for visiting the city is in late spring (late April and May), and early in autumn: September, October, when the city's trees turn yellow. Other times are mainly dry with a few showers.<ref>See also: [http://www.klimadiagramme.de/Europa/dnepropetrovsk.html klimadiagramme.de] – Climate in Dnipropetrovsk URL accessed on 20 March 2007</ref>

Dnipro is a primarily industrial city of around one million people. It has developed into a large urban centre over the past few centuries to become, today, Ukraine's fourth-largest city after [[Kyiv]], [[Kharkiv]] and [[Odessa|Odesa]]. [[Stalinist architecture]] (monumental soviet classicism) dominates in the city centre.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnepr.com/main/sport_and_culture_dp/7847-ot-stalinskogo-ampira-do-brezhnevskogo-minimalizma.html |title=От "сталинского ампира" до "брежневского минимализма" " www.DNEPR.com – Главный портал города Днепропетровска |publisher=DNEPR.com |date=7 October 2011 |access-date=12 March 2013}}</ref>

Immediately after its foundation Yekaterinoslav, began to develop exclusively on the right bank of the [[Dnieper River]]. At first the city developed radially from the central point provided by the [[Transfiguration Cathedral, Dnipro|Transfiguration Cathedral]], completed in 1835.<ref name="ukrssr2"/> [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] structures of brick and stone construction were preferred and the city began to take on the appearance of a typical European city of the era. Many of these buildings have been retained in the city's older [[Sobornyi District, Dnipro|Sobornyi District]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=52 |title=История Днепропетровска и Приднепровья |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |access-date=12 March 2013}}</ref> Among the most important buildings of this era are the Transfiguration Cathedral, and a number of buildings in the area surrounding Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt, including the [[Khrennikov House]].

Over the next few decades, until the final end of the [[Russian Empire]] with the [[October Revolution]] in 1917, the city did not change much in appearance. The predominant architectural style remained [[neo-classicism]]. Notable buildings built in the era before 1917 include the main building of the [[Dnipro Polytechnic]], which was built in 1899–1901,<ref>{{cite web |author=Вт, 12 марта 201307:51 |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/out/attractions/oneplace/?place_id=932 |title=Национальный Горный Университет – Днепропетровск |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |access-date=12 March 2013}}</ref> the art-nouveau inspired building of the city's former [[Duma]] (parliament),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dneprotur.ucoz.com/photo/retrophotos/old_dnepropetrovsk/city_council/27-0-46 |title=Городская Дума – Старый Днепропетровск – Ретрофото – Фотоальбомы – Памятники, архитектура, история, туризм |publisher=Dneprotur.ucoz.com |access-date=12 March 2013}}</ref> the Dnipropetrovsk National Historical Museum, and the [[Élie Metchnikoff|Mechnikov]] Regional Hospital.

Once Yekaterinoslav became part of the [[Soviet Union]] ([[Treaty on the Creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|officially in 1922]]), and became Dnipropetrovsk in 1926,<ref name="Petrovsky"/> the city was gradually purged of tsarist-era monuments. Monumental architecture was stripped of Imperial coats of arms and other non-socialist symbolism. Following the 1917 October Revolution, a monument to [[Catherine the Great]] that stood in front of the Mining Institute was replaced with one of Russian academic [[Mikhail Lomonosov]].<ref name="oneplace1220130751">{{cite web |author=Вт, 12 марта 201307:51 |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/out/attractions/oneplace/?place_id=1122 |title=Ломоносову М.В., памятник – Днепропетровск |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |date=14 September 2011 |access-date=12 March 2013}}</ref>

Later, due to damage from [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]], badly damaged buildings were, more often than not, demolished completely and replaced with new structures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=67 |title=История Днепропетровска и Приднепровья |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |access-date=12 March 2013}}</ref> In the early 1950s, during the ongoing industrialisation of the city, much of Dnipropetrovsk's centre was rebuilt in the Stalinist style of [[Socialist Realism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=39 |title=История Днепропетровска и Приднепровья |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |access-date=12 March 2013}}</ref> This is one of the main reasons why much of Dnipro's central avenue, [[Dmytro Yavornytsky|Akademik Yavornitskyi]] Prospekt (formerly [[Karl Marx]] Prospect), is designed in the style of Stalinist Social Realism.<ref>[http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=67] Центральный проспект почти полностью был разрушен.

The [[Khrennikov House|Grand Hotel Ukraine]] survived the war but was later simplified much in design, with its roof being reconstructed in a typical French [[Mansard roof|mansard style]] as opposed to the ornamental [[Ukrainian Baroque]] of the pre-war era. Many pre-revolution buildings were reconstructed to suit new purposes. For example, the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Emperor Nicholas II]] Commercial Institute in the city was reconstructed to serve as the administrative centre for the [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]], a function it fulfils to this day. Other buildings, such as the Potemkin Palace were given over to "the [[proletariat]]" (the [[working man]]), in this case as the students' union of the [[Oles Honchar Dnipro National University]].

After the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953 and the appointment of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], the industrialisation of Dnipropetrovsk became even more profound, with the [[PA Pivdenmash|Southern (Yuzhne) Missile and Rocket factory]] being set up in the city. However, this was not the only development and many other factories, especially metallurgical and heavy-manufacturing plants, were set up in the city.<ref name=gorod.dp.ua-68>{{cite news |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=68 |title=История Днепропетровска и Приднепровья |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |access-date=12 March 2013}}</ref>

As a result of all this industrialisation the city's inner suburbs became increasingly polluted and were gradually given over to large, industrial enterprises. At the same time the extensive development of the city's left bank and western suburbs as new residential areas began.<ref name=gorod.dp.ua-68/> The low-rise tenant houses of the Khrushchev era ([[Khrushchyovka]]s) gave way to the construction of high-rise prefabricated apartment blocks (similar to German [[Plattenbau]]s). In 1976, in line with the city's 1926 renaming, a large monumental statue of [[Grigoriy Petrovsky]] was placed on the square in front of the [[Dnipro railway station|city's railway station]].<ref name="toppled135443012"/><ref>[http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=67] В 1976 г. архитектурно-художественная композиция привокзальной площади была завершена постановкой памятника Г.

Since the [[independence of Ukraine]] in 1991 and the economic development that followed, a number of large commercial and business centres have been built in the city's outskirts. To this day the city is characterised by its mix of architectural styles, with much of the city's centre consisting of pre-revolutionary buildings in a variety of styles, stalinist buildings and constructivist architecture, while residential districts are, more often than not, made up of aesthetically simple, technically outdated mid-rise and high-rise housing stock from the Soviet era. Despite this, the city has a large number of 'private sectors' where the tradition of building and maintaining individual detached housing has continued to this day.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Other notable industrial company of Dnipro is [[PA Pivdenmash]], a heavy machinery and rocket manufacturer.

Metals and metallurgy is the city's core industry in terms of output. Employment in the city is concentrated in large-sized enterprises. Metallurgical enterprises are based in the city and account for over 47% of its industrial output. These enterprises are important contributors to the city's budget and, with 80% of their output being exported, to Ukraine's foreign exchange reserve. Dnipro serves as the main import hub for foreign goods coming into the oblast and, on average, accounted for 58% of the oblast's imports between 2005 and 2011. With economic conditions improving even further in 2010 and 2011, registered unemployment fell to about 4,100 by the end of 2011.

The city of Dnipro's economy is dominated by the wholesale and retail trade sector, which accounted for 53% of the output of non-financial enterprises in 2010.

The main forms of public transport used in Dnipro are trams, buses and electric [[trolley bus]]es. In addition to this there are a large number of taxi firms operating in the city, and many residents have private cars.

The city's municipal roads also suffer from the same funding problems as the trams, with many of them in a very poor technical state.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} It is not uncommon to find very large potholes and crumbling surfaces on many of Dnipro's smaller roads.

===Suburban transportation===
[[File:Central bridge Dnipro.jpg|thumb|Bridges linking the city's right and left banks are heavily used]]

Dnipro has some highways crossing through the city. The most popular routes are from [[Kyiv]], [[Donetsk]], [[Kharkiv]] and [[Zaporizhzhia]]. Transit through the city is also available. {{As of|2011}} the city is also seeing construction of a southern urban bypass, which will allow automobile traffic to proceed around the city centre. This is expected to both improve air quality and reduce transport issues from heavy freight lorries that pass through the city centre.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The largest bus station in [[eastern Ukraine]] is located in Dnipro, from where bus routes are available to all over the country, including some international routes to [[Poland]], Germany, [[Moldova]] and [[Turkey]]. It is located near the city's central railway station. Since the start of the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]] Ukraine's border crossings with Russia and [[Belarus]] are closed to regular traffic.<ref name="gov.uktaU18112022">{{Cite web |title=Foreign travel advice Ukraine|url=https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ukraine/returning-to-the-uk|date=|access-date=18 November 2022|website=[[GOV.UK]] |language=English}}<br>{{Cite web |title=War in Ukraine: The village with Russia and Belarus on its doorstep|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61220296|date=26 April 2022|access-date=18 November 2022|website=[[BBC News]] |language=English}}</ref>

In the summertime, there are some routes available by [[hydrofoil]]s on the [[Dnieper River]], while various tourist ships on their way down the river, (Kyiv–[[Kherson]]–[[Odesa]]) tend to make a stop in the city. Dnipro's river port is located close to the area surrounding the central railway station, on the banks of the river.

===Rail===

There are two railway terminals, [[Dnipro Railway station|Dnipro Holovnyi]] (main station) and Dnipro Lotsmanska (south station).

Two express passenger services run each day between [[Kyiv]] and Dnipro under the name 'Capital Express'. Other daytime services include suburban trains to towns and villages in the surrounding [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]]. Most long-distance trains tend to run at night to reduce the amount of daytime hours spent travelling by each passenger.

Domestic connections exist between Dnipro and [[Kyiv]], [[Lviv]], [[Odesa]], [[Ivano-Frankivsk]], [[Truskavets]], [[Kharkiv]] and many other smaller Ukrainian cities, while international destinations include, among others the Bulgarian seaside resort of [[Varna, Bulgaria|Varna]].

Dnipro has a variety of theatres ([[Dnipro Academic Drama and Comedy Theatre]], [[Taras Shevchenko Dnipro Academic Ukrainian Music and Drama Theatre]] and [[Dnipro Opera and Ballet Theatre]]), a circus ([[Dnipro State Circus]]) and several museums ([[Dmytro Yavornytsky National Historical Museum of Dnipropetrovsk|Dmytro Yavornytsky National Historical Museum]], [[Diorama "Battle of the Dnieper"]] and [[Dnipro Art Museum]]). There are also several restaurants, beaches and parks ([[Taras Shevchenko Park]] and [[Sevastopol Park]]).

The major streets of the city were renamed in honour of [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist]] heroes during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet era]].<ref name="streetsarticle98Markova"/> Following the 2015 [[decommunization in Ukraine|law on decommunization]] these have been renamed.<ref name=decommupbbcU/><ref name="radiosvoboda.mobi"/>

The central thoroughfare is known as Akademik [[Dmytro Yavornytsky|Yavornytskyi]] Prospekt, a wide and long boulevard that stretches east to west through the centre of the city. It was founded in the 18th century and parts of its buildings are the actual decoration of the city. In the heart of the city is Soborna Square, which includes the [[Transfiguration Cathedral, Dnipro|Transfiguration Cathedral]] founded by order of [[Catherine the Great]] in 1787.<ref name="sobor2"/> On the square, there are some remarkable buildings: the Museum of History, [[Diorama "Battle of the Dnieper"]] ([[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]]).

The [[Ukrposhta]] for the city was once housed at the [[Central Post Office (Dnipro)|Central Post Office]], a 20th century building. Rising magnificently above the Dnieper, the building's tower has become one of the most identifiable features in the city.<ref name=":25">{{Cite web |last=Доброта |first=Валерия |date=2024-02-19 |title=Свидетели эпохи: какие тайны и легенды хранит Днепровский Главпочтамт |url=https://nashemisto.dp.ua/ru/2024/02/19/svideteli-jepohi-kakie-tajny-i-legendy-hranit-dneprovskij-glavpochtamt/ |access-date=2024-03-17 |website=Наше Місто |language=ru-RU}}</ref><ref name=":32">{{Cite web |last=Дєточкін |first=Юрій |date=2021-11-25 |title=Прокуратура требует вернуть государству почтамт на проспекте Дмитрия Яворницкого в Днепре |url=https://d1.ua/prokuratura-trebuet-vernut-gosudarstvu-pochtamt-na-prospekte-dmitriya-yavornitskogo-v-dnepre |access-date=2024-03-17 |website=Телеканал D1 |language=uk}}</ref>

Further from the city centre and next to the [[Dnieper River]] (spelled "Dnipro" in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]) is the large [[Taras Shevchenko]] Park (which is on the right bank of the river) and [[Monastyrskyi Island]].

A few areas retain their historical character: all of Central Avenue, some street-blocks on the main hill (the Nagorna part) between [[Lesya Ukrainka]] Avenue and Embankment, and sections near Globa (formerly known as [[Chkalov]] park until it was renamed) and Shevchenko parks have been untouched for 150 years.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The river keeps the climate mild.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} It is visible from many points in Dnipro. From any of the three hills in the city, one can see a view of the river, islands, parks, outskirts, river banks and other hills.

There was no need to build skyscrapers in the city in Soviet times. The major industries preferred to locate their offices close to their factories and away from the centre of town. Most new office buildings are built in the same architectural style as the old buildings. A number, however, display more modern aesthetics, and some blend the two styles.
