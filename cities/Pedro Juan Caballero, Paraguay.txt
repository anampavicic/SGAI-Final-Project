==History==

Pedro Juan Caballero originated around a small lake. The city based its economy initially on the processing of [[yerba mate]] (it is located in the south end of the herds of Tacurupyta, that, after the War of the Triple Alliance, were almost totally passed into the hands of Brazil) and the forest exploitation. On December 1, 1899, a police station was built, near the Punta Porá Lagoon, a date that is considered to be that of the creation of the city. Some scholars, however, consider that the correct date of foundation is August 30, 1901. In 1899, merchant Don Jorge Casaccia, owner of large tracts of land, plantations and an import-export company founded at the end of the War of the Triple Alliance, a large shareholder of "La Industrial Paraguaya" and the "Mercantile Bank", ceded to the government a land for the settlement of the population, according to SA Cardona.

The first house was built in 1894, owned by Don Jose Tapia Ortiz, although it actually settled in a place called "Portera", a year after the foundation of Ponta Porã. But as early as 1893, Don Pablino Ramirez had settled with his wagons and footpaths on the shores of Lake Punta Porá, making it difficult to known for sure who was the first "official" Pedrojuanino. Pedro Juan Caballero was founded on December 1, 1900. On December 13, 1901, the first peace court was created, with José Ramón Giménez as the first judge. On December 29, 1905, the Junta Económico Administrativa was created to carry out activities very similar to those of the present communes and municipalities.

Don Rufino Spika Henry was the first president. On July 10, 1945, the city of Pedro Juan Caballero was designated capital of the department of Amambay XIII. In the second half of the 20th century, the city had a rapid commercial development, being nowadays not only a border trade city with Brazil, but also a tourist city and host of international events.
