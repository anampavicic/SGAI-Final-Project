It is a peninsula bordered by [[Basilicata]] to the north, the [[Ionian Sea]] to the east, the [[Strait of Messina]] to the southwest, which separates it from [[Sicily]], and the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] to the west. It has almost 2 million residents across a total area of {{cvt|15222|km2|sqmi}}. [[Catanzaro]] is the region's capital.

Calabria is the birthplace of the [[name of Italy]],<ref>Guillotining, M., History of Earliest Italy, trans. Ryle, M & Soper, K. in Jerome Lectures, Diciassettesima serie, p.50</ref> given to it by the [[Ancient Greeks]] who settled in this land starting from the [[8th century BC]]. They established the first cities, mainly on the coast, as [[Greek colonisation|Greek colonies]] and during this period Calabria became the home of key figures in history such as [[Pythagoras]], [[Herodotus]] and [[Milo of Croton|Milo]].

In Roman times, it was part of the ''Regio III Lucania et Bruttii'', a region of [[Roman Italy|Augustan Italy]]. After the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]], it became and remained for five centuries a [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] dominion, fully recovering its [[Culture of Greece|Greek]] character. [[Cenobitism]] flourished, with the rise throughout the peninsula of numerous churches, hermitages and monasteries in which [[Basilian monks]] were dedicated to transcription. The Byzantines introduced the art of [[silk]] in Calabria and made it the main silk production area in [[Europe]]. In the 11th century, the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman conquest]] started a slow process of Latinization.

In Calabria there are three historical ethnolinguistics minorities: the [[Griko people|Grecanici]], speaking [[Calabrian Greek]]; the [[Arbëreshë people]]; and the [[Occitans]] of [[Guardia Piemontese]]. This extraordinary linguistic diversity makes the region an object of study for linguists from all over the world.

Calabria is famous for its crystal clear sea waters and is dotted with ancient villages, castles and archaeological parks. Three national parks are found in the region: the [[Pollino National Park]] (which is the largest in Italy), the [[Sila National Park]] and the [[Aspromonte National Park]].

==Etymology==
Starting in the third century BC, the name ''Calabria'' was originally given to the Adriatic coast of the [[Salento]] peninsula in modern [[Apulia]].<ref name="The Italic People of Ancient Apulia: New Evidence from Pottery for Workshops ... - Google Books">{{cite book |editor1-last=Carpenter |editor1-first=T. H. |editor2-last=Lynch |editor2-first=K. M. |editor3-last=Robinson |editor3-first=E. G.

The whole region of Apulia received the name ''Regio II Apulia et Calabria''. By this time modern Calabria was still known as ''Bruttium'', after the [[Bruttians]] who inhabited the region. Later in the seventh century AD, the [[Byzantine Empire]] created the Duchy of Calabria from the Salento and the [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] part of Bruttium. Even though the Calabrian part of the duchy was conquered by the [[Lombards]] during the eighth and ninth centuries AD, the Byzantines continued to use the name ''Calabria'' for their remaining territory in Bruttium.<ref>{{cite book |last=Colafemmina |first=Cesare |title=The Jews in Calabria |date=2012 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden, The Netherlands |isbn=9789004234123 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nSYyAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA1 1]}}</ref>

Originally the Greeks used ''Italoi'' to indicate the native population of modern Calabria, which according to some ancient Greek writers was derived from a legendary king of the Oenotri, [[Italus]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Dionysius of Halicarnassus |author-link=Dionysius of Halicarnassus |title=Roman Antiquities |year=1937 |publisher=Harvard University Press |chapter=1.35 |chapter-url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/1B*.html#35 |access-date=19 February 2021 |archive-date=15 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221215151343/https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/1B%2A.html#35 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Strabo |author-link=Strabo |year=1924 |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=H.

Over time the Greeks started to use ''Italoi'' for the rest of the southern Italian peninsula as well. After the Roman conquest of the region, the name was used for the entire Italian peninsula and eventually the Alpine region too.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pallottino |first=Missimo |title=A History of Earliest Italy |year=2014 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York City |isbn=9781317696827 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nk7XAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA50 50]}}</ref>

The region is generally known as the "toe" of the [[Italian Peninsula]], and is a long and narrow peninsula which stretches from north to south for {{cvt|248|km|0}}, with a maximum width of {{cvt|110|km|0}}. Some 42% of Calabria's area, corresponding to 15,080&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, is mountainous, 49% is hilly, while plains occupy only 9% of the region's territory. It is surrounded by the [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] and [[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]] seas. It is separated from [[Sicily]] by the [[Strait of Messina]], where the narrowest point between [[Capo Peloro]] in Sicily and [[Punta Pezzo]] in Calabria is only {{cvt|3.2|km|0}}.

Three mountain ranges are present: [[Pollino]], [[La Sila]], and [[Aspromonte]], each with its own flora and fauna. The [[Pollino Mountains]] in the north of the region are rugged and form a natural barrier separating Calabria from the rest of Italy. Parts of the area are heavily wooded, while others are vast, wind-swept plateaus with little vegetation. These mountains are home to a rare [[Bosnian Pine]] variety and are included in the [[Pollino National Park]], which is the largest national park in Italy, covering 1,925.65 square kilometres.

[[La Sila]], which has been referred to as the "Great Wood of Italy",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.praiaartresort.com/en/journeys/ |title=Journeys |access-date=2 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702124802/https://www.praiaartresort.com/en/journeys/ |archive-date=2 July 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.madeinsouthitalytoday.com/the-calabria--national-park.php |title=The Calabria National Park, sila Grande and Sila Piccola |website=www.madeinsouthitalytoday.com |access-date=6 March 2016 |archive-date=4 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904015120/http://www.madeinsouthitalytoday.com/the-calabria--national-park.php |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.costatiziana.it/pages/eng/attivita_montagna.php |title=attivita_montagna – Costa Tiziana |access-date=28 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220065125/http://www.costatiziana.it/pages/eng/attivita_montagna.php |archive-date=20 December 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> is a vast mountainous plateau about {{cvt|1200|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]] and stretches for nearly {{cvt|2000|km2|abbr=off}} along the central part of Calabria. The highest point is [[Botte Donato]], which reaches {{cvt|1928|m|abbr=off}}. The area boasts numerous lakes and dense coniferous forests.

The [[Aspromonte]] massif forms the southernmost tip of the Italian peninsula bordered by the sea on three sides. This unique mountainous structure reaches its highest point at Montalto, at {{cvt|1995|m|abbr=off}}, and is full of wide, man-made terraces that slope down toward the sea.

Most of the lower terrain in Calabria has been agricultural for centuries, and exhibits indigenous scrubland as well as introduced plants such as the [[prickly pear cactus]]. The lowest slopes are rich in vineyards and orchards of citrus fruit, including the [[Diamante citron]]. Further up, olives and chestnut trees appear while in the higher regions there are often dense forests of oak, pine, beech and fir trees.

===Climate===
Calabria's climate is influenced by the sea and mountains. The [[Mediterranean climate]] is typical of the coastal areas with considerable differences in temperature and rainfall between the seasons, with an average low of {{cvt|8|°C|0}} during the winter months and an average high of {{cvt|30|°C|0}} during the summer months. Mountain areas have a typical mountainous climate with frequent snow during winter. The erratic behavior of the Tyrrhenian Sea can bring heavy rainfall on the western slopes of the region, while hot air from Africa makes the east coast of Calabria dry and warm. The mountains that run along the region also influence the climate and temperature of the region. The east coast is much warmer and has wider temperature ranges than the west coast. The geography of the region causes more rain to fall along the west coast than that of the east coast, which occurs mainly during winter and autumn and less during the summer months.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.italyaround.com/en/calabria-climate-when-to-go-to-calabria/ |title=Calabria climate: when to go to Calabria – Italy: travel, recipes, family and health |date=17 March 2016 |access-date=13 April 2016 |archive-date=26 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426005425/http://www.italyaround.com/en/calabria-climate-when-to-go-to-calabria/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:CalabrianArc-GeotectonicSection.jpg|thumb|Geotectonic Cross Section of the Calabrian Arc. Left: NW; Right: SE. From van Dijk (1992).<ref name ='van Dijk-etal_2000, a'/>]]

Calabria is commonly considered part of the "Calabrian Arc", an arc-shaped geographic domain extending from the southern part of the [[Basilicata]] Region to the northeast of [[Sicily]], and including the [[Peloritani|Peloritano Mountains]] (although some authors extend this domain from [[Naples]] in the north to [[Palermo]] in the southwest). The Calabrian area shows basement (crystalline and metamorphic rocks) of [[Paleozoic]] and younger ages, covered by (mostly Upper) [[Neogene]] sediments. Studies have revealed that these rocks comprise the upper part of a pile of thrust sheets which dominate the [[Apennines]] and the Sicilian [[Maghrebides]].<ref name ='van Dijk-etal_2000, a'>van Dijk, J.P., Bello, M., Brancaleoni, G.P., Cantarella, G., Costa, V., Frixa, A., Golfetto, F., Merlini, S., Riva, M., Toricelli, S., Toscano, C., and Zerilli, A. (2000, a); A new structural model for the northern sector of the Calabrian Arc. Tectonophysics, 324, 267–320.</ref>

The [[Neogene]] evolution of the Central Mediterranean system is dominated by the migration of the Calabrian Arc to the southeast, overriding the African Plate and its promontories.<ref name ='Argand_1922'>Argand, E. (1922); La tectonique de l'Asie. Comptes Rendus 3rd Int. Geol. Congr., Liège (Be), 1922, 1, 171–372.</ref><ref name ='Boccaletti-and-Guazzone_1972, b'>Boccaletti, M., and Guazzone, G. (1972, b); Evoluzione paleogeografica e geodinamica del Mediterraneo: i bacini marginali. Mem. Soc. geol. It., 13, 162–169.</ref>) The main tectonic elements of the Calabrian Arc are the southern Apennines fold-and-thrust belt, the "Calabria-Peloritani", or simply Calabrian block and the Sicilian Maghrebides fold-and-thrust belt. The foreland area is formed by the [[Apulia]] Platform, which is part of the [[Adriatic]] Plate, and the [[Ragusa, Italy|Ragusa]] or [[Iblean]] Platform, which is an extension of the African Plate. These platforms are separated by the [[Ionian Basin]]. The [[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]] oceanized basin is regarded as the [[back-arc basin]]. This [[subduction]] system therefore shows the southern plates of African affinity subducting below the northern plates of European affinity.<ref name ='van Dijk-etal_2000, a'/>

The geology of Calabria has been studied for more than a century.<ref name ='Ogniben_1973'>Ogniben, Leo (1973); Schema geologico della Calabria in base ai dati odierni. Geol. Romana, 12, 243–585.</ref><ref name ='Ippolito_1959'>Ippolito, Felice (1959); Bibliografia geologica d'Italia, Vol. 4, Calabria. C.N.R., Roma</ref><ref name ='Cortese_1895'>Cortese, E. (1895); Descrizione geologica della Calabria. Mem. Descrit. Carta Geol. It., 9, 310 pp., Roma.</ref> The earlier works were mainly dedicated to the evolution of the basement rocks of the area. The Neogene sedimentary successions were merely regarded as "post-orogenic" infill of "neo-tectonic" tensional features. In the course of time, however, a shift can be observed in the temporal significance of these terms, from post-[[Eocene]] to post-Early [[Miocene]] to post-middle [[Pleistocene]].<ref name ='van Dijk-etal_2000, a'/>

The region is seismically active and is generally ascribed to the re-establishment of an equilibrium after the latest (mid-Pleistocene) deformation phase. Some authors believe that the subduction process is still ongoing, which is a matter of debate.<ref name ='van Dijk-and-Scheepers_1995'>{{cite journal |last1=van Dijk |first1=J.P. |last2=Scheepers |first2=P.J.J. |date=1995 |title=Neogene rotations in the Calabrian Arc.

During the eighth and seventh centuries BC, Greek settlers founded many colonies (settlements) on the coast of southern Italy. In Calabria they founded Chone ([[Pallagorio]]), Cosentia ([[Cosenza]]), Clampetia ([[Amantea]]), [[Scyllaeum]] ([[Scilla]]), [[Sybaris]] ([[Sibari]]), [[Hipponion]] ([[Vibo Valentia]]), [[Locri Epizephyrii]] ([[Locri]]), [[Kaulon]] ([[Monasterace]]), [[Krimisa]] ([[Cirò Marina]]), [[Crotone|Kroton]] ([[Crotone]]), [[Laüs]] (''comune'' of [[Santa Maria del Cedro]]), [[Medma]] ([[Rosarno]]), [[Metauros]] ([[Gioia Tauro]]), [[Petelia]] ([[Strongoli]]), [[Rhegion|Rhégion]] ([[Reggio Calabria]]), [[Scylletium]] ([[Borgia, Calabria|Borgia]]), [[Temesa (ancient city)|Temesa]] ([[Campora San Giovanni]]), [[Terina (ancient city)|Terina]] ([[Nocera Terinese]]), [[Pandosia (Bruttium)|Pandosia]] ([[Acri]]) and [[Thurii]], (Thurio, ''comune'' of [[Corigliano Calabro]]).

Rhegion was the birthplace of one of the famed [[nine lyric poets]], [[Ibycus]] and Metauros was the birthplace of another, [[Stesichorus]], who was amongst the first lyric poets of the western world. Kroton spawned many victors during the ancient Olympics and other Panhellenic Games. Amongst the most famous were [[Milo of Croton]], who won six wrestling events in six Olympics in a row, along with seven events in the Pythian Games, nine events in the Nemean Games and ten events in the Isthmian Games and also [[Astylos of Croton]], who won six running events in three Olympics in a row.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/content/olympic-games/ancient-olympic-games/the-athlete/ |title=Olympic Games – Winter Summer Past and Future Olympics |date=20 December 2018 |access-date=27 April 2016 |archive-date=27 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427125306/http://www.olympic.org/content/olympic-games/ancient-olympic-games/the-athlete/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Through [[Alcmaeon of Croton]] (a philosopher and medical theorist) and [[Pythagoras]] (a mathematician and philosopher), who moved to Kroton in 530 BC, the city became a renowned center of philosophy, science and medicine.

The Greek cities of Calabria came under pressure from the [[Lucania]]ns who conquered the north of Calabria and pushed further south, taking over part of the interior, probably after they defeated the [[Thurii|Thurians]] near Laus in 390 BC. A few decades later the [[Bruttii]] took advantage of the weakening of the Greek cites caused by wars between them and took over Hipponium, [[Terina (ancient city)|Terina]] and Thurii. The Bruttii helped the Lucanians fight [[Alexander I of Epirus|Alexander of Epirus]] (334–32 BC), who had come to the aid of [[Taranto|Tarentum]] (in [[Apulia]]), which was also pressured by the Lucanians. After this, [[Agathocles of Syracuse]] ravaged the coast of Calabria with his fleet, took Hipponium and forced the Bruttii into unfavourable peace terms. However, they soon seized Hipponium again. After Agathloces' death in 289 BC the Lucanians and Bruttii pushed into the territory of Thurii and ravaged it. The city sent envoys to Rome to ask for help in 285 BC and 282 BC. On the second occasion, the Romans sent forces to garrison the city. This was part of the episode which sparked the Pyrrhic war.

===Romanisation===
[[File:Sybaris archeological park 6.jpg|thumb|Excavated mosaic floor with [[swastikas]], [[Sybaris]].]]
At the beginning of the 3rd century BC the cities of southern Italy, which had been allies of the Samnites, were still independent<ref>{{harvnb|Grant|1993|p=77}}</ref> but inevitably came into conflict as a result of Rome's continuous expansion<ref name="enemiesP14">{{harvnb|Matyszak|2004|p=14}}</ref><ref name="historyOrRomeP78">{{harvnb|Grant|1993|p=78}}</ref> as their expansion in central and northern Italy had not been sufficient to provide new arable lands they needed.<ref name="Musti_536">{{harvnb|Musti|1990|p=536}}</ref>

====Pyrrhic War====
{{Main|Pyrrhic War}}
During the Pyrrhic War (280–275 BC) the Lucanians and Bruttii sided with Pyrrhus and provided contingents which fought with his army. 

After Pyrrhus was eventually defeated, to avoid Roman revenge the Bruttii submitted willingly and gave up half of the Sila, a mountainous plateau valuable for its pitch and timber.<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Histories, 20.5–6</ref> Rome subjugated southern Italy by means of treaties with the cities.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane Fox|2005|p=307}}</ref>

====Punic Wars====
{{Main|Second Punic War}}
[[File:Second Punic war (cropped).png|thumb|Allies of Hannibal (blue) in Second Punic War]]

During the Second Punic War (218–201 BC) the Bruttii allied with [[Hannibal]], who sent [[Hanno, son of Bomilcar|Hanno]], one of his commanders, to Calabria. Hanno marched toward [[Capua]] (in Campania) with Bruttian soldiers to take them to Hannibal's headquarters there twice, but he was defeated on both occasions. When his campaign in Italy came to a dead end, Hannibal took refuge in Calabria, whose steep mountains provided protection against the Roman legions. He set up his headquarters in Kroton and stayed there for four years until he was recalled to Carthage. The Romans fought a battle with him near Kroton, but its details are unknown. Many Calabrian cities surrendered to the Romans<ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 30.19</ref> and Calabria was put under a military commander.

===Roman era===
[[File:Shepherd-c-030-031.jpg|thumb|Calabria in Roman times]]
Nearly a decade after the war, the Romans set up colonies in Calabria: at Tempsa and Kroton (Croto in Latin) in 194 BC, Copiae in the territory of Thurii (Thurium in Latin) in 193 BC, and Vibo Valentia in the territory of Hipponion in 192 BC.<ref>Livy, The History of Rome, 34.45, 53; 35.40</ref> 

Starting in the third century BC, the name ''Calabria'' was given to the Adriatic coast of the [[Salento]] peninsula in modern [[Apulia]].<ref name="The Italic People of Ancient Apulia: New Evidence from Pottery for Workshops ... - Google Books" /> In the late first century BC this name came to extend to the entirety of the Salento, when the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] emperor [[Augustus]] divided Italy into regions and modern Calabria was known as Regio III Lucania et Bruttii.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWVQOcpVuZoC |title=The Etruscans Outside Etruria |first1=Paolo |last1=Bernardini |first2=Giovannangelo |last2=Camporeale |date=1 January 2004 |publisher=Getty Publications |isbn=978-0-89236-767-2 |access-date=12 August 2016 |archive-date=27 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230227163907/https://books.google.com/books?id=KWVQOcpVuZoC |url-status=live }}</ref>

After sacking Rome in 410, Alaric I (King of the Visigoths) went to Calabria with the intention of sailing to Africa. He contracted malaria and died in Cosentia ([[Cosenza]]), probably of fever. Legend has it that he along with the treasure of Rome were buried under the bed of the River Busento.<ref>Erik Durschmied, From Armageddon to the Fall of Rome, Ch. 17</ref>

===Middle Ages===
With the fall of the western part of the Roman Empire in 476, Italy was taken over by the Germanic chieftain Odoacer and later became part of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in 489. The Ostrogothic kings ruled officially as Magistri Militum of the Byzantine Emperors and all government and administrative positions were held by the Romans, while all primary laws were legislated by the Byzantine Emperor. Therefore, during the sixth century, under the Ostrogoths' rule, Romans could still be at the center of government and cultural life, such as the Roman [[Cassiodorus]] who, like Boethius and Symmachus, emerged as one of the most prominent men of his time. He was an administrator, politician, scholar and historian who was born in Scylletium (near Catanzaro). He spent most of his career trying to bridge the divides of East and West, Greek and Latin cultures, Romans and Goths, and official Christianity and [[Arian Christianity]], which was the form of Christianity of the Ostrogoths and which had earlier been banned. He set up his [[Vivarium (monastery)]] in Scylletium. He oversaw the collation of three editions of the Bible in Latin. Seeing the practicality of uniting all the books of the Bible in one volume, he was the first who produced Latin Bibles in single volumes.<ref>Peter Brown, The World of Late Antiquity: AD 150–750.</ref> The most well-known of them was the [[Codex Grandior]] which was the ancestor of all modern western Bibles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xn8i8cLNDM |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/9xn8i8cLNDM |archive-date=2021-12-11 |url-status=live |title=Testament The Bible And History episode 6 Power And Glory part one (1 of 2) |last=TheGreatMysteries |date=3 April 2011 |via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name="faculty.georgetown.edu">{{Cite web |url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/texts/cassbook/chap6.html |title=Cassiodorus, Chapter 6: Vivarium |website=faculty.georgetown.edu |access-date=6 March 2016 |archive-date=8 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208100752/http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/texts/cassbook/chap6.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Cassiodorus was at the heart of the administration of the Ostrogothic kingdom. Theodoric made him quaestor sacri palatii (quaestor of the sacred palace, the senior legal authority) in 507, governor of Lucania and Bruttium, consul in 514 and magister officiorum (master of offices, one of the most senior administrative officials) in 523. He was praetorian prefect (chief minister) under the successors of Theodoric: under Athalaric (Theodoric's grandson, reigned 526–34) in 533 and, between 535 and 537, under Theodahad (Theodoric's nephew, reigned 534–36) and Witiges (Theodoric's grandson-in-law, reigned, 536–40).<ref>Cassiodorus, Variae, 9.24–54, 38–39</ref> The major works of Cassiodorus, besides the mentioned bibles, were the Historia Gothorum, a history of the Goths, the Variae and account of his administrative career and the Institutiones divinarum et saecularium litterarum, an introduction to the study of the sacred scriptures and the liberal arts which was very influential in the Middle Ages.

[[Byzantine]] (Eastern Roman) Emperor Justinian I, retook Italy from the Ostrogoths between 535 and 556. They soon lost much of Italy to the [[Lombards]] between 568 and 590, but retained the south for around 500 years until 1059–1071, where they thrived and where the Greek language was the official and vernacular language. In Calabria and towns such as [[Stilo]] and [[Rossano]] and [[San Demetrio Corone]] achieved great religious status. From the 7th Century many monasteries were built in the Amendolea and Stilaro Valleys and Stilo was the destination of hermits and Basilian monks. Many Byzantine churches are still seen in the region. The 10th-century church in Rossano, together with the "twin" church of Sant'Adriano in San Demetrio Corone (foundation 955, rebuilt by the [[Normans]] on the, still, visible foundations of the previous Byzantine church), are considered between the best preserved Byzantine churches in Italy. They were both built by St. [[Nilus the Younger]] as a retreat for the monks who lived in the tufa grottos underneath. The present name of Calabria comes from the duchy of Calabria.

Around the year 800, [[Saracen]]s began invading the shores of Calabria, attempting to wrest control of the area from the Byzantines. This group of [[Arabs]] had already been successful [[Emirate of Sicily|in Sicily]] and knew that Calabria was another key spot. The people of Calabria retreated into the mountains for safety. Although the Arabs never really got a stronghold on the whole of Calabria, they did control some villages while enhancing trade relations with the eastern world.<ref name="bleedingespresso.com">{{cite web |url=http://bleedingespresso.com/calabria/history-of-calabria |title=Bleeding Espresso |author=metatags generator |publisher=bleedingespresso.com |access-date=24 October 2015 |archive-date=28 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928031330/http://bleedingespresso.com/calabria/history-of-calabria |url-status=live }}</ref> In 918, Saracens captured [[Reggio di Calabria|Reggio]] (which was renamed ''Rivà''), holding many of its inhabitants to ransom or keeping them prisoners as slaves.<ref>''The Italian Cities and the Arabs before 1095'', Hilmar C.

Under the Byzantine dominion, between the end of the 9th and the beginning of the 10th century, Calabria was one of the first regions of Italy to introduce silk production to Europe.
According to André Guillou,<ref>{{cite book |language=it |first1=André |last1=Guillou |first2=Paolo |last2=Delogu |title=Storia d'Italia |volume=III |chapter=Il mezzoggiorno dai Bizantini a Federico II |year=1983 |publisher=UTET}}</ref> [[Morus (plant)|mulberry trees]] for the production of raw silk were introduced to southern Italy by the Byzantines at the end of the ninth century.
Around 1050 the theme of Calabria had 24,000, mulberry trees cultivated for their foliage, and their number tended to expand.<ref name="Southern Italy in the Late Middle Ages">{{cite book |last1=Sakellariou |first1=Eleni |title=Southern Italy in the Late Middle Ages: Demographic, Institutional Change in the Kingdom of Naples, c.1440-c.1530 |date=2011 |publisher=Brill}}</ref>

At the beginning of the tenth century ({{circa|903}}),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.initalytoday.com/calabria/catanzaro/ |title=Catanzaro Italy: Catanzaro guide, city of Catanzaro, Calabria Italy |publisher=Initalytoday.com |access-date=26 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923122332/http://www.initalytoday.com/calabria/catanzaro/ |archive-date=23 September 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> the city of Catanzaro was occupied by the Muslim [[Saracens]], who founded an [[emirate]] and took the Arab name of قطنصار – Qaṭanṣār. An Arab presence is evidenced by findings at an eighth-century necropolis which had items with Arabic inscriptions. Around the year 1050, Catanzaro rebelled against Saracen dominance and returned to a brief period of Byzantine control.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://viaggiart.com/en/catanzaro |title=Catanzaro: What to see and what to do |access-date=26 October 2020 |archive-date=29 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201029141032/https://viaggiart.com/en/catanzaro |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the 1060s the [[Normans]], under the leadership of [[Robert Guiscard]]'s brother, [[Roger I of Sicily]], established a presence in this [[Marches|borderland]], and organized a government modeled on the Eastern Roman Empire and was run by the local magnates of Calabria. Of note is that the Normans established their presence here, in southern Italy (namely Calabria), 6 years prior to their conquest of England, (see [[The Battle of Hastings]]). The purpose of this strategic presence in Calabria was to lay the foundations for the Crusades 30 years later, and for the creation of two Kingdoms: the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the Kingdom of Sicily. Ships would sail from Calabria to the Holy Land. This made Calabria one of the richest regions in Europe as princes from the noble families of England, France and other regions, constructed secondary residences and palaces here, on their way to the Holy Land. Guiscard's son [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond]], who was born in [[San Marco Argentano]], would be one of the leaders in the first crusade. Of particular note is the [[Via Francigena]], an ancient pilgrim route that goes from Canterbury to Rome and southern Italy, reaching Calabria, Basilicata and Apulia, where the crusaders lived, prayed and trained, respectively.

In 1098, [[Roger I of Sicily]] was named the equivalent of an apostolic legate by [[Pope Urban II]]. His son [[Roger II of Sicily]] later became the first [[List of monarchs of Sicily|King of Sicily]] and formed what would become the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], which lasted nearly 700 years. Under the Normans southern Italy was united as one region and started a feudal system of land ownership in which the Normans were made lords of the land while peasants performed all the work on the land.

In 1147, Roger II of Sicily attacked [[Corinth]] and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], two important centers of Byzantine silk production, capturing the weavers and their equipment and establishing his own silkworks in Calabria,<ref name="AM">Muthesius, Anna, "Silk in the Medieval World". In Jenkins (2003), p. 331.</ref> thereby causing the Norman silk industry to flourish.

In 1194, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], took control of the region, after inheriting the Kingdom from his mother [[Constance, Queen of Sicily]]. He created a kingdom that blended cultures, philosophy and customs and would build several castles, while fortifying existing ones which the Normans previously constructed. After the death of Frederick II in 1250, Calabria was controlled by the [[Capetian House of Anjou]], under the rule of [[Charles I of Naples|Charles d’Anjou]] after being granted the crown of the Sicilian Kingdom by [[Pope Clement IV]]. In 1282, under Charles d’Anjou, Calabria became a domain of the newly created [[Kingdom of Naples]], and no longer of the Kingdom of Sicily, after he lost Sicily due to the rebellion of the [[Sicilian Vespers]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> During the 14th century, would emerge [[Barlaam of Seminara]] who would be [[Petrarch]]'s Greek teacher and his disciple [[Leonzio Pilato]], who would translate Homer's works for [[Giovanni Boccaccio]].

While the cultivation of [[mulberry]] was moving first steps in [[northern Italy]], silk made in Calabria reached the peak of 50% of the whole Italian/European production. As the cultivation of mulberry was difficult in Northern and Continental Europe, merchants and operators used to purchase in Calabria raw materials to finish the products and resell them for a better price. The [[Genoa|Genoese]] silk artisans used fine Calabrian silk for the production of velvets.<ref name="Southern Italy in the Late Middle Ages" />
In particular, the silk of [[Catanzaro]] supplied almost all of Europe and was sold in a large market fair to Spanish, [[Venice|Venetian]], [[Genoa|Genoese]], [[Florence|Florentine]] and Dutch merchants.
Catanzaro became the lace capital of Europe with a large silkworm breeding facility that produced all the laces and linens used in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. The city was known for its fabrication of silks, velvets, damasks and brocades.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.madeinitalyfor.me/en/info/lantica-e-nobile-arte-serica/ |title=The Ancient and Noble Art of Silk |date=14 May 2015 |access-date=20 October 2020 |archive-date=23 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201023023019/https://www.madeinitalyfor.me/en/info/lantica-e-nobile-arte-serica/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Catanzaro-Italy |title=Catanzaro &#124; Italy |access-date=20 October 2020 |archive-date=21 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201021132631/https://www.britannica.com/place/Catanzaro-Italy |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Early modern period===
In the 15th century, [[Catanzaro]] was exporting both its silk cloth and its technical skills to neighbouring [[Sicily]]. By the middle of the century, silk spinning was taking place in Catanzaro, on a large scale.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sakellariou |first1=Eleni |title=Southern Italy in the Late Middle Ages: Demographic, Institutional Change in the Kingdom of Naples, c.1440-c.1530 |date=2011 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-900-422-4063 |page=407}}</ref>

In 1442, the Aragonese took control under [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] who became ruler under the [[Crown of Aragon]]. In 1501 Calabria came under the control of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], whose wife Queen Isabella of Castille is famed for sponsoring the first voyage of Christopher Columbus in 1492. Calabria suffered greatly under Aragonese rule with heavy taxes, feuding landlords, starvation and sickness. After a brief period in the early 1700s under the Austrian Habsburgs, Calabria came into the control of the Spanish Bourbons in 1735.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> It was during the 16th century that Calabria would contribute to modern world history with the creation of the [[Gregorian calendar]] by the Calabrian doctor and astronomer [[Luigi Lilio]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/gregorian-calendar.html |title=The Gregorian Calendar |website=www.timeanddate.com |access-date=2 July 2019 |archive-date=26 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626042652/https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/gregorian-calendar.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sussexvt.k12.de.us/science/The%20History%20of%20the%20World%201500-1899/Gregorian%20Calendar%20Adopted.htm |title=Gregorian Calendar Adopted |access-date=6 March 2016 |archive-date=5 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605110751/http://www.sussexvt.k12.de.us/science/The%20History%20of%20the%20World%201500-1899/Gregorian%20Calendar%20Adopted.htm |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.naplesldm.com/lillo.html |title=Luigi Lillo, the Gregorian Calendat & the Carafa Castle |first=Jeff |last=Matthews |access-date=6 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401173802/http://www.naplesldm.com/lillo.html |archive-date=1 April 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1466, King [[Louis XI]] decided to develop a national silk industry in [[Lyon]] and called a large number of Italian workers, mainly from Calabria. The fame of the master weavers of Catanzaro spread throughout France and they were invited to Lyon to teach the techniques of weaving.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rossi |first1=Cesare |last2=Russo |first2=Flavio |date=2016 |title=Ancient Engineers' Inventions: Precursors of the Present}}</ref> In 1470, one of these weavers, known in France as Jean Le Calabrais, invented the first prototype of a [[Jacquard machine|Jacquard]]-type loom.<ref>{{cite book |language=it |last=Rubino |first=Angela |date=2006 |title=La seta a Catanzaro e Lione.

[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V of Spain]] formally recognized the growth of the silk industry of [[Catanzaro]] in 1519 by allowing the city to establish a consulate of the silk craft, charged with regulating and check in the various stages of a production that flourished throughout the sixteenth century. At the moment of the creation of its guild, the city declared that it had over 500 [[loom]]s. By 1660, when the town had about 16,000 inhabitants, its silk industry kept 1,000 looms, and at least 5,000 people, busy. The silk textiles of [[Catanzaro]] were not only sold at the [[Kingdom of Naples|kingdom]]'s markets, they were also exported to Venice, France, Spain and England.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sakellariou |first1=Eleni |title=Southern Italy in the Late Middle Ages: Demographic, Institutional Change in the Kingdom of Naples, c.1440-c.1530 |date=2011 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-900-422-4063}}</ref>

In the 16th century, Calabria was characterized by a strong demographic and economic development, mainly due to the increasing demand of silk products and the simultaneous growth of prices, and became one of the most important Mediterranean markets for silk.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Galasso |first1=Giuseppe |title=Economia e società nella Calabria del Cinquecento |language=it |date=1975 |publisher=L'Altra Europa}}</ref>

In 1563 philosopher and natural scientist [[Bernardino Telesio]] wrote "On the Nature of Things according to their Own Principles" and pioneered early modern empiricism.

During the 17th century, silk production in Calabria begin to suffer by the strong competition of new-raising competitors in Italian Peninsula and Europe (France), but also the increasing import from Ottoman Empire and Persia.

[[File:Circular settlement of sandy deposits in the Rosarno Plain (from an original etching in Sarconi, 1784) - 1783 Calabrian earthquake.png |thumb| 1783 Calabrian earthquakes , note the phenomenon of [[soil liquefaction]] ]]

In 1783, a series of [[1783 Calabrian earthquakes|earthquakes across Calabria]] caused around 50,000 deaths and much damage to property, so that many of the buildings in the region were rebuilt after this date.

At the end of the 18th century, the French took control and in 1808 Napoleon Bonaparte gave the Kingdom of Naples to his brother-in-law [[Joachim Murat]]. Murat controlled the kingdom until the return of the Bourbons in 1815. The population of Calabria in 1844 was 1,074,558.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol.IV'', (1848) London, Charles Knight, p.17</ref>

Calabria experienced a series of peasant revolts as part of the European [[Revolutions of 1848]]. This set the stage for the eventual unification with the rest of Italy in 1861, when the [[Kingdom of Naples]] was brought into the union by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]. The unification was orchestrated by Great Britain in an attempt to nationalize the production of sulfur from the two volcanoes located in Naples and Sicily respectively. The [[Aspromonte]] was the scene of a famous battle of the unification of Italy. During the late 19th or early 20th century, pianist and composer [[Alfonso Rendano]] invented the "Third Pedal",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://susanvanallen.wordpress.com/2014/04/28/golden-day-107-cosenza-with-lulu-bianco-of-calabrisella-mia/ |title=Golden Day 107: Cosenza with LuLu Bianco of Calabrisella Mia |date=28 April 2014 |access-date=12 August 2016 |archive-date=20 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220080440/https://susanvanallen.wordpress.com/2014/04/28/golden-day-107-cosenza-with-lulu-bianco-of-calabrisella-mia/ |url-status=live }}</ref> which augmented the interpretative resources of the piano.

The ancient Greek colonies from Naples and to the south, had been completely [[Latinization (historical)|Latinized]], but from the fifth century AD onward Greeks had once again emigrated there when pressed out of their homeland by invasions. This Greek Diaspora allowed the ancient Greek dialects to continue in southern Italy, much in the same way that the Italian Diaspora allowed long-lost dialects from Italy to thrive in countries where Italians emigrated to. Greek texts were also valued in monasteries and places of learning. However it was [[Charlemagne]] in the 8th century, who made Latin the 'official' language of study and communication for Europe. For the sake of uniformity, he supplanted much of the Greek spoken, read or taught in Europe. It was through language (Latin) and education (Latin texts) that Charlemagne united Europe.

During the 13th century a French chronicler who traveled through Calabria stated that "the peasants of Calabria spoke nothing but Greek" given he had traveled to areas where Greek was still available. But the educated classes spoke Italian. Indeed, formal Italian has been taught in schools throughout Italy for nearly two centuries, causing the ancient languages and dialects to continually disappear, much to the chagrin of the cultural community. These lost dialects continue to thrive to this day in North America and Australia, places where Italians emigrated to, on account of the [[Diaspora]].

===Modern era===
On 19 August 1860, Calabria was invaded from Sicily by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] and his Redshirts as part of the [[Expedition of the Thousand]].<ref name="Alfred Knopf">{{cite book |last1=Norwich |first1=John Julius |title=The Middle Sea: A History of the Mediterranean |date=2007 |publisher=Alfred Knopf |location=New York |isbn=978-0307387721 |page=xxvii}}</ref> Through King Francesco II of Naples had dispatched 16,000 soldiers to stop the Redshirts, who numbered about 3,500, after a token battle at Reggio Calabria won by the Redshirts, all resistance ceased and Garibaldi was welcomed as a liberator from the oppressive rule of the Bourbons wherever he went in Calabria.<ref name="Alfred Knopf"/> Calabria together with the rest of the Kingdom of Naples was incorporated in 1861 into the Kingdom of Italy. Garibaldi planned to complete the ''Risorgimento'' by invading Rome, still ruled by the pope protected by a French garrison, and began with semi-official encouragement to raise an army.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mack Smith |first1=Denis |title=Italy and Its Monarchy |date=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0300051328 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack/page/12 12-13] |url=https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack}}</ref> Subsequently, King Victor Emmanuel II decided the possibility of war with France was too dangerous, and on 29 August 1862 Garibaldi's base in the Calabrian town of [[Aspromonte]] was attacked by the ''Regio Esercito''.<ref name="Italy and Its Monarchy">{{cite book |last1=Mack Smith |first1=Denis |title=Italy and Its Monarchy |date=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0300051328 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack/page/14 14] |url=https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack}}</ref> The [[Battle of Aspromonte]] ended with the Redshirts defeated with several being executed after surrendering while Garibaldi was badly wounded.<ref name="Italy and Its Monarchy"/>

In the newly unified Kingdom of Italy, there were significant differences in level of economic development between the ''Nord'' (north) of Italy and the ''Mezzogiorno'' (the south of Italy). Calabria together with the rest of the ''Mezzogiorno'' was neglected under the Kingdom of Italy with the general feeling in Rome being that the region was hopelessly backward and poor. In the late 19th century about 70% of the population of the ''Mezzogiorno'' were illiterate as the government never invested in education for the south.<ref name="archive.org">{{cite book |last1=Mack Smith |first1=Denis |title=Italy and Its Monarchy |date=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0300051328 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack/page/165 165] |url=https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack}}</ref> Owing to the [[Roman Question]], until 1903 the Roman Catholic Church had prohibited on the pain of excommunication Catholic men from voting in Italian elections (Italian women were not granted the right to vote until 1946).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mack Smith |first1=Denis |title=Italy and Its Monarchy |date=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0300051328 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack/page/165 165-166] |url=https://archive.org/details/italyitsmonarchy0000mack}}</ref> As the devoutly Catholic population of Calabria tended to boycott elections, the deputies who were elected from the region were the products of the clientistic system, representing the interests of the land-owning aristocracy.

Tourism in Calabria has increased over the years. The main tourist attractions are the coastline and the mountains. The coastline alternates between rugged cliffs and sandy beaches, and is sparsely interrupted by development when compared to other European seaside destinations. The sea around Calabria is clear, and there is a good level of tourist accommodation. The poet [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] called the coast facing Sicily near Reggio Calabria "... the most beautiful kilometer in Italy" (''il più bel chilometro d'Italia'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deliciousitaly.com/guide/south-italy-regions/calabria-guide/calabria-itineraries/item/1459-guide-to-reggio-calabria.html |title=Guide to Reggio Calabria |publisher=Delicious Italy |date=8 May 2012 |access-date=26 March 2013 |archive-date=12 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012031655/http://www.deliciousitaly.com/guide/south-italy-regions/calabria-guide/calabria-itineraries/item/1459-guide-to-reggio-calabria.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.insidersabroad.com/italy/regions/calabria |title=Regions – Calabria |publisher=Insiders Abroad |access-date=26 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319140053/http://www.insidersabroad.com/italy/regions/calabria |archive-date=19 March 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The primary mountain tourist draws are [[Aspromonte]] and [[La Sila]], with its national park and lakes.

Calabria attracts year-round tourism, offering both summer and winter activities, in addition to its cultural, historical, artistic heritage, it has an abundance of protected natural habitats and 'green' zones. The {{cvt|485|mi|abbr=off}} of its coast make Calabria a tourist destination during the summer. The low industrial development and the lack of major cities in much of its territory have allowed the maintenance of indigenous marine life.

The most sought-after seaside destinations are: [[Tropea]], [[Pizzo, Calabria|Pizzo Calabro]], [[Capo Vaticano]], [[Reggio Calabria]], [[Soverato]], [[Scilla, Calabria|Scilla]], [[Scalea]], [[Sellia Marina]], [[Montepaone]], [[Montauro]], Copanello (''comune'' of [[Staletti]]), [[Palmi, Calabria|Tonnara di Palmi]], [[Diamante, Calabria|Diamante]], [[Paola, Calabria|Paola]], [[Fiumefreddo Bruzio]], [[Amantea]], [[Praia a Mare]], [[Belvedere Marittimo]], [[Roseto Capo Spulico]], [[Corigliano Calabro]], [[Cirò Marina]], [[Amendolara]], [[Roccella Ionica]], [[Bagnara Calabra]], [[Nicotera]], [[Cariati]], [[Zambrone]], [[Isola di Capo Rizzuto]], Caminia (''comune'' of [[Staletti]]), [[Siderno]], [[Parghelia]], [[Ricadi]] and [[San Nicola Arcella]].

In addition to the coastal tourist destinations, the interior of Calabria is rich in history, traditions, art and culture. Cosenza is among the most important cultural cities of Calabria, with a rich historical and artistic patrimony. Medieval castles, towers, churches, monasteries and other French castles and structures from the Norman to the Aragonese periods are common elements in both the interior and coastline of Calabria.

The mountains offer skiing and other winter activities: [[Sila National Park|Sila]], [[Pollino National Park|Pollino]] and [[Aspromonte]] are three national parks that offer facilities for winter sports, especially in the towns of Camigliatello (''comune'' of [[Spezzano della Sila]]), Lorica (''comune'' of [[San Giovanni in Fiore]]), [[Gambarie]].

==Infrastructure and transport==

===Motorways and rail===

The region is served by three heavily used roads: two national highways along the coasts (the SS18 between [[Naples]] and Reggio Calabria and the SS106 between Reggio Calabria and [[Taranto]]) and the [[Autostrada A2 (Italy)|A2 motorway]],<ref>{{in lang|it}} ''...una vera e propria «vergogna italiana»'', in [http://www.almcalabria.it/calabriaradicale/a3/la-storia-della-salerno-reggio-calabria/ La storia della Salerno Reggio Calabria] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722023438/http://www.almcalabria.it/calabriaradicale/a3/la-storia-della-salerno-reggio-calabria/ |date=22 July 2011 }}, book about Salerno-Reggio Calabria</ref> which links [[Salerno]] to Reggio Calabria, passing by [[Cosenza]] along the old inland route.

The main Calabrian ports are in [[Gioia Tauro]] and in [[Reggio Calabria]]. 

The [[port of Gioia Tauro]] has seven loading docks with an extension of {{cvt|4646|m|ft|abbr=off}}; it is the largest in Italy and the eighth largest [[container port]] in Europe, with a 2018 throughput of {{TEU|4.0 million}}s<ref>{{cite web |url=https://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitViewTableAction.do |title=The largest European ports |access-date=14 May 2021 |archive-date=21 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230121154457/https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/main/eurostat/web/main/help/faq/data-services |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Top_20_ports_handling_containers,_2008-2018_(thousand_TEUs).png |title=Top_20_ports_handling_containers |access-date=14 May 2021 |archive-date=5 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210505171325/https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Top_20_ports_handling_containers,_2008-2018_(thousand_TEUs).png |url-status=live }}</ref> from more than 3,000 ships. In a 2006 report, Italian investigators estimated that 80% of Europe's [[cocaine]] arrived from [[Colombia]] via Gioia Tauro's docks. The port is also involved in the [[illegal arms trafficking]]. These activities are controlled by the '''Ndrangheta'' criminal syndicate.<ref name=gua191206>[https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,1974925,00.html Bitter harvest] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190911230212/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/19/italy.ethicalliving |date=11 September 2019 }}, [[The Guardian]], 19 December 2006</ref>

<!--Please leave the title as "Planned bridge, not "The bridge" otherwise people skimming this article will assume the bridge exists (as I did!)

{{Main|Strait of Messina Bridge}}
Plans for a bridge linking Sicily to Calabria have been discussed since 1865. Throughout the last decade, plans were developed for a road and rail link to the mainland via what would be the world's longest [[suspension bridge]], the [[Strait of Messina Bridge]]. Planning for the project has experienced several false starts over the past few decades. On 6 March 2009, [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s government declared that the construction works for the Messina Bridge would begin on 23 December 2009, and announced a pledge of €1.3&nbsp;billion as a contribution to the bridge's total cost, estimated at €6.1&nbsp;billion.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7928949.stm Italy revives Sicily bridge plan from BBC News]. Retrieved 8 March 2009.</ref>
The plan has been criticized by environmental associations and some local Sicilians and Calabrians, concerned with its environmental impact, economic sustainability and even possible infiltrations by organized crime.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/italy/story/0,,1920199,00.html |work=Guardian.co.uk |title=Italian MPs kill plan to bridge Sicily and mainland |date=2 January 2008 |location=London |first=John |last=Hooper |access-date=30 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120777463250502755?mod=todays_us_nonsub_page_one&apl=y&r=769642 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |title=No Italian Job Takes Longer Than This Bridge |date=10 April 2008 |first=Gabriel |last=Kahn}}</ref>

==Language==
{{Main|Languages of Calabria}}
[[File:Carta Occitania.pdf|thumb|La Gàrdia (Guardia Piemontese) and the other main cities of [[Occitania]], in the [[Occitan language|Occitan]] language]]

Although the official national language of Calabria has been Standard Italian since before unification in 1861, Calabria has dialects that have been spoken in the region for centuries. The Calabrian language is a direct derivative of Latin. Most linguists divide the various [[dialects of Calabria|dialects]] into two different language groups. In the northern area of the region,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/scn/23 |title=report for language code:sic<!-- Titre généré automatiquement --> |access-date=15 September 2020 |archive-date=16 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200916233112/https://www.ethnologue.com/language/scn/23 |url-status=live }}</ref> the Calabrian dialects are considered part of the [[Neapolitan language]] and are grouped as Northern Calabrian. In the rest of the region, the Calabrian dialects are often grouped as Central and Southern Calabrian, and are considered part of the [[Sicilian language]]. However, in [[Guardia Piemontese]], as well as some quarters of Reggio Calabria, a variety of [[Occitan language|Occitan]] called [[Gardiol]] can also be found. In addition, since Calabria was once ruled by the French and Spanish, some Calabrian dialects exhibit Spanish and French influences.
Another important linguistic minority, in the nine towns of [[Bovesia|Bovesìa]] in the province of [[Reggio Calabria]], speaks a derivative of [[ancient Greek]] called [[Griko language|Grecanico]], a remnant of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule and ancient [[Magna Graecia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eu.greekreporter.com/2019/12/10/calabrian-greek-a-language-on-the-brink-of-extinction/ |title=Calabrian Greek, a Language on the Brink of Extinction |work=Greek Reporter |first=Kerry |last=Kolasa-Sikiaridi |date=December 10, 2019 |access-date=August 31, 2021 |archive-date=30 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200930061714/https://eu.greekreporter.com/2019/12/10/calabrian-greek-a-language-on-the-brink-of-extinction/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Religion===
The majority of Calabrians are [[Roman Catholic]]. Historically, Calabrians were [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]], and in 732 the dioceses of southern Italy were even moved to the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople. There are also communities of [[Evangelical]]s in the region.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://rabbibarbara.com/secret-jews-evangelical-christians/ |title=Secret Jews Evangelical Christians |access-date=8 February 2021 |archive-date=27 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210127100019/https://www.rabbibarbara.com/secret-jews-evangelical-christians/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Calabria has also been called "The Land of Saints" as the region was the birthplace of many saints spanning nearly 2,000 years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://orthodoxengland.org.uk/oeitaly.htm |title=Orthodox Europe :: Italy |website=orthodoxengland.org.uk |access-date=28 February 2016 |archive-date=28 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128083018/http://orthodoxengland.org.uk/oeitaly.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://orthochristian.com/7354.html |title=Orthodox Christianity in Southern Italy.

Calabria also has another patron saint called Saint [[Bruno of Cologne]] who was the founder of the [[Carthusian]] Order. Saint Bruno would build the charterhouse of [[Serra San Bruno]], a town which bears his name, in 1095 and later die there in 1101.

Even though it is currently a very small community, there has been a long history of the presence of [[History of the Jews in Calabria|Jews in Calabria]]. The Jews have had a presence in the region for at least 1600 years and possibly as much as 2300 years. Calabrian Jews have had notably influence on many areas of Jewish life and culture. Although virtually identical to the Jews of Sicily, the Jews of Calabria are considered a distinct Jewish population due to historical and geographic considerations. There is a small community of Italian [[Anusim]] who have resumed the Jewish faith.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishroots.it/ |title=Center for the Study of Jewry in Calabria and Sicily |access-date=11 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612053046/http://www.jewishroots.it/ |archive-date=12 June 2010}}</ref>

It is important to highlight the presence of Calabrians in [[Renaissance humanism]] and in the [[Renaissance]]. Indeed, the Hellenistics in this period frequently came from Calabria maybe because of the Greek influence. The rediscovery of Ancient Greek was very difficult because this language had been almost forgotten. In this period the presence of Calabrian humanists or refugees from Constantinople was fundamental. The study of Ancient Greek, in this period, was mainly a work of two monks of the monastery of [[Seminara]]: [[Barlaam of Calabria|Barlaam]], [[bishop of Gerace]], and his disciple, [[Leonzio Pilato]]. [[Leonzio Pilato]], in particular, was a Calabrian born near [[Reggio Calabria]]. He was an important teacher of Ancient Greek and translator, and he helped [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] in the translations of [[Homer]]'s works.

==Cuisine==
{{See also|Calabrian wine|U cumbitu}}
[[File:'Nduja.JPG|thumb|[['Nduja]]]]
The cuisine is a typical southern Italian [[Mediterranean cuisine]] with a balance between meat-based dishes (pork, lamb, goat), vegetables (especially [[eggplant]]), and fish. Pasta (as in central Italy and the rest of southern Italy) is also very important in Calabria. In contrast to most other Italian regions, Calabrians have traditionally placed an emphasis on the preservation of their food and packing vegetables and meats in [[olive oil]], and on making sausages and cold cuts (''[[soppressata]]'', [['Nduja|'nduja]], ''[[capocollo]]''). Along the coast fish is cured, especially [[swordfish]], [[sardine]]s (''sardelle rosamarina'') and [[cod]] (''[[Dried and salted cod|baccalà]]''). Local desserts are typically fried, honey-sweetened pastries such as ''cudduraci'', nacatole, ''scalille'' or ''scalidde'', or baked [[biscotti]]-type treats such as ''nzudda''.

Some local specialties include [[Caciocavallo|''caciocavallo'' cheese]], ''[[Red onion|cipolla rossa di Tropea]]'' (red onion), ''[[Frittole (meat dish)|frìttuli]]'' and ''[[curcùci]]'' (fried pork), [[liquorice]] (''liquirizia''), ''[[Lagane e ceci|lagane e cicciari]]'' (a pasta dish with [[chickpea]]s),'' [[pecorino crotonese]]'' (sheep cheese), and ''[[pignolata]]''.

In ancient times Calabria was referred to as ''Enotria'' (from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|Οἰνωτρία}}, ''{{transliteration|grc|[[Oenotria]]}}'', 'land of wine'). According to [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] tradition, {{lang|grc|Οἴνωτρος}} (''{{transliteration|grc|[[Oenotrus]]}}''), the youngest of the sons of [[Lycaon (king of Arcadia)|Lycaon]], was the [[eponym]] of Oenotria.<ref name="theoi">{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias8A.html |title=Pausanias, Description of Greece, Arcadia, 8.3.5, at Theoi Project |publisher=theoi.com |access-date=24 October 2015 |archive-date=13 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113093013/http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias8A.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Some vineyards have origins dating back to the ancient Greek colonists. The best known [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC]] wines are [[Calabrian wine#Cirò|Cirò]] ([[province of Crotone]]) and [[Cosenza|Donnici]] ([[province of Cosenza]]). 3% of the total annual production qualifies as DOC. Important grape varieties are the red [[Gaglioppo]] and white [[Vino Greco|Greco]]. Many producers are resurrecting local, ancient grape varieties which have been around for as long as 3000 years.<ref>[http://www.the-wine-library.co.uk/A-E/C/Terms/Calabria.html The-Wine-Library] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605012224/http://www.the-wine-library.co.uk/A-E/C/Terms/Calabria.html |date=5 June 2009 }} Short Description of wine in Calabria</ref>

[[File:Ospedali della Calabria.png|thumb|right| public hospitals in Calabria ]]
The health service in Calabria is organized into four main public hospitals and thirty secondary ones, and there are numerous private hospital facilities.Because of their debts, since 2009 they were administered by an extraordinary commissioner . It has been seen as an unavoidable step to return to an ordinary and cost-effective administration at a regional level, as it is provided by the Italian Constitution.

The four main public hospitals are

*Azienda Ospedaliera "Pugliese-Ciaccio" ,[[Catanzaro]]
*Azienda Ospedaliera "Mater Domini" ,[[Catanzaro]]
*Azienda Ospedaliera di Cosenza , [[Cosenza]]
