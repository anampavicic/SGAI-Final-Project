'''San Miguel''', officially the '''Municipality of San Miguel''' ({{lang-tgl|Bayan ng San Miguel}}, [[kapampangan language|Kapampangan]]: ''Balen ning San Miguel''),  is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Bulacan]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 172,073 people.{{PH census|current}}

It is the third largest municipality by area in the province after [[Do√±a Remedios Trinidad]] and [[Norzagaray]].

==Etymology==
There are two accounts on the origin of the town's name:
* According to the 1953 journal ''History of Bulacan'', the town was originally named ''Mayumo'' from the Kapampangan term for "sweets". The name San Miguel was added by the Augustinian missionaries who selected [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] as the patron saint of the town.<ref name="history"/>
* An account tells that the two leaders decided to form a town named Miguel De Mayumo after the name of Miguel Pineda and ''Mayumo'', from the Kapampangan term and for the goodwill and generosity of Mariano Puno.

==History==

===Spanish colonial era===
[[File:FvfSanMiguel6926 11.JPG|thumb|[[San Miguel Arcangel Church (San Miguel, Bulacan)|San Miguel Arkanghel Parish Church]] built by Augustinian missionaries during the Spanish Occupation]]
The municipality of San Miguel de Mayumo was established in 1763 by Carlos Agustin Maniquiz, Maria Juana Puno - wife of Carlos Agustin Maniquiz and Miguel Pineda, with Pineda as the first town mayor of San Miguel. Miguel Pineda was a native of [[Angat, Bulacan]] who decided to settle permanently in the barrio of San Bartolome (now named Barangay Tartaro). He found the place ideal for hunting and was later chosen as the leader of other settlers. He formed an alliance with Mariano Puno, the recognized leader of the adjacent prosperous village called Santo Rosario (now named Barangay Mandile).

The town was previously part of Pampanga, hence San Miguel's culture having [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]] influence. In 1848, the town and the neighbouring barrios, which were then part of Pampanga, were added to the territory of the Province of Bulacan.<ref name="history"/>

====The Pact of Biak-Na-Bato====
{{Main|Pact of Biak-na-Bato}}
[[File:0934jfPoblacion School Monument San Jose San Miguel Bulacan Bulacanfvf 01.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Biak-na-Bato Heroes and San Miguel Martyrs Monument (foreground) and the old American-era water district tower (background)]]
During the [[Philippine Revolution]] in 1897, newly appointed Governor-General [[Fernando Primo de Rivera]] decided to crush [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] and his troops in [[Cavite]], but Aguinaldo fled to [[Batangas]] and joined forces with Gen. [[Miguel Malvar]]. The Spaniards continue their pursuit but the troops outwitted them by going to the district of [[Morong (district)|Morong]] (now [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]]) and finally to Biak-na-Bato in San Miguel, Bulacan. Aguinaldo made the mountain caves into his headquarters.<ref name="biac na bato 1"/><ref name="biac na bato 2"/>

Biak-na-Bato ({{cvt|21.17|km2}} in the villages of Kalawakan and Talbak in [[Do√±a Remedios Trinidad, Bulacan|Do√±a Remedios Trinidad]] town and the villages of Biak-na-Bato and Sibul) served as one of the camps of the revolutionary [[Katipunan]] forces during the [[Philippine Revolution]]. It was declared a [[national park]] by [[Manuel L. Quezon]] on November 16, 1937, through Proclamation No. 223.<ref name="biac na bato park"/>

===American occupation era===
Between 1903 and 1906, the adjacent town of [[San Ildefonso, Bulacan|San Ildefonso]] was consolidated with San Miguel due to the former's low income and inability to finance its expenditures in operating the local government.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=932|date=October 8, 1903|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%20932|title=An Act Reducing the Twenty-five Municipalities of the Province of Bulacan to Thirteen|accessdate=July 3, 2023|website=Senate of the Philippines Legislative Digital Resources}}</ref> It was later separated from the town to become an independent town of its own when it became capable of meeting its expenses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bulacan.gov.ph/sanildefonso/history.php|title = Bulacan, Philippines: San Ildefonso, Bulacan: History}}</ref>

===Japanese occupation era===
During [[World War II]], Japanese Imperial ground troops entered and occupied the town municipality of San Miguel on 1942. Local Filipino troops of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] and [[Philippine Constabulary]] units retreated into the nearby mountains to become the Bulake√±o guerrilla resistance against the Japanese occupation forces until the province's liberation.

===Philippine independence era===
San Miguel was the largest town in Bulacan until September 13, 1977, when [[Do√±a Remedios Trinidad, Bulacan|Do√±a Remedios Trinidad]], the current largest municipality of Bulacan, was established under ''Presidential Decree No. 1196'' during the term of President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].<ref name="drt"/>

===Contemporary===
On August 26, 2007, residents at the foot of the Biak-na-Bato mountains petitioned president [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] to declare the mountains protected areas to stop [[marble]] quarrying and [[mining]] there.<ref>[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/regions/view_article.php?article_id=84808 Inquirer.net, Bulace√±os want Biak-na-Bato declared a protected area]</ref>

In August 2014 during a fieldtrip to the Madlum Cave, seven students of [[Bulacan State University]] were swept after heavy rains which triggered a flash flood while crossing the Madlum river.<ref>{{Cite news |date=March 28, 2018 |title=CA upholds dismissal of Bulacan State University officials over field trip tragedy |work=Rappler.com |url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/199150-ca-dismissal-bulacan-state-university-san-miguel-field-trip-tragedy/ |access-date=June 9, 2023}}</ref>

==Geography==

San Miguel then was the biggest municipality in the province of Bulacan before some areas were taken and annexed to Do√±a Remedios Trinidad during the term of [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. The geographic nature of the town is diversified and multi-faceted, rich in nature's beauty like waterfall, rivers, caves, few mountains, hilly areas and springs. The mainland are plain agricultural lands, some part of which was substantially eroded due to commercialization and urbanization. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the 2020 census, the population of San Miguel, Bulacan, was 172,073 people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|172,073/231.40|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or|sp=us}}.

===Languages===
The municipality, along with two other municipalities (Remedios Trinidad and Norzagaray) and one city (San Jose del Monte) of Bulacan, is the homeland of the ''Alta Kabulowan'', the first inhabitants of Bulacan, [[Southern Alta language|whose language]] is also called '''Alta Kabulowan'''. Their language is currently endangered and is in dire need of local government intervention. The majority of residents in the town are native speakers of the [[Tagalog language]]. Due to its proximity with Pampanga towns and it was part of Pampanga, some residents also speak the [[Kapampangan language]].

=== Religion and Traditions ===
Currently, San Miguel is divided into four parishes and a large number of ''visitas'', all of which are under the jurisdiction of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Malolos|Diocese of Malolos]]. These are [[San Miguel Arcangel Church (San Miguel, Bulacan)|Diocesan Shrine and Parish of San Miguel Arcangel]] located in Brgy. Poblacion; San Jose Esposo de Maria Parish located in Brgy. San Jose; Nuestra Se√±ora delos Remedios Parish located in Brgy. Sibul Springs; and Sacred Heart of Jesus Parish located in Brgy. Salacot.

The traditions are very alive and well-preserved in San Miguel, as shown by the [[Holy Week in the Philippines|Holy Week processions]] in the mother church, which include about 60 ''carrozas''. Numerous images of our Lord, the Blessed Mother, and saints, visited this church, such as the [[Black Nazarene|Nuestro Padre Jesus Nazareno of Quiapo]] and [[Immaculate Conception Parish Church (Santa Maria)|La Purisima Concepcion de Santa Maria]]. Every May 8, San Miguel holds its town ''fiesta'', and every September 29, it celebrates its ''Pistang Patron'' celebration.
[[File:Procesion de los Desposorios.jpg|alt=The image of our Lady wearing her traditional wedding dress, accompanied by the dancers of the parish.|thumb|252x252px|Procession de los Desposorios]]
The tradition of ''Los Desposorios'' or the [[Marriage of the Virgin|Bethrotal of Mary and Joseph]] is very alive at San Jose Esposo de Maria Parish in Brgy. San Jose. The said parish celebrates its [[Patronal festival|fiesta]] every 26 November, the traditional date which the [[Augustinians]] celebrates the feast of the Bethrotal. It will start with ''Procesion de los Desposorios'' and after that, the antique image of Saint Joseph and Our Lady meets at the [[patio]] of the parish and the rite of the [[Renewal of vows|Renewal of Vows]] will be conducted.
