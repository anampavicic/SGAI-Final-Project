'''The Hague''' ({{IPAc-en|h|eɪ|ɡ}} {{respell|HAYG}}; {{lang-nl|Den Haag}} {{IPA|nl|dɛn ˈɦaːx||Nl-Den Haag.ogg}} or {{lang|nl|'s-Gravenhage}} {{IPA|nl|ˌsxraːvə(n)ˈɦaːɣə||Nl-'s-Gravenhage.ogg}}) is the capital city of the [[South Holland]] province of the [[Netherlands]]. With a population of over half a million, it is the third-largest city in the Netherlands. Situated on the west coast facing the [[North Sea]], The Hague is the country's administrative centre and its [[seat of government]], and while the official [[capital of the Netherlands]] is [[Amsterdam]], The Hague has been described as the country's ''de facto'' capital since the time of the [[Dutch Republic]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kaufmann |first=David |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1049802517 |title=Varieties of Capital Cities: The Competitiveness Challenge for Secondary Capitals |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |date=2018 |isbn=978-1-78811-643-5 |location=Cheltenham, UK |oclc=1049802517}}</ref>

The Hague is the core municipality of the [[COROP|Greater The Hague urban area]] containing over 800,000 residents, and is also part of the [[Rotterdam–The Hague metropolitan area]], which, with a population of approximately 2.6&nbsp;million, is the largest metropolitan area of the Netherlands. The city is also part of the [[Randstad]] region, one of the largest [[conurbation]]s in Europe.

The Hague is also home to the headquarters of [[List of companies of the Netherlands|many Dutch companies]], with [[Shell plc]] having major offices in the city as well. The [[Royal Library of the Netherlands]] is also located there. The Hague's coastal area includes the popular seaside resort [[Scheveningen]].

The Hague is known as the global hub of international law and arbitration. The [[International Court of Justice]], the main judicial arm of the [[United Nations]], is based in the city, as are the [[International Criminal Court]], the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]], the [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]], [[Europol]], and approximately 200 other [[international governmental organization]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Internationale organisaties in Den Haag |url=https://www.denhaag.nl/nl/bestuur-en-organisatie/stad-van-vrede-en-recht/den-haag-internationale-stad-van-vrede-en-recht-1.htm |website=Gemeente Den Haag |access-date=3 February 2019 |language=nl |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204065736/https://www.denhaag.nl/nl/bestuur-en-organisatie/stad-van-vrede-en-recht/den-haag-internationale-stad-van-vrede-en-recht-1.htm |archive-date=4 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The name "The Hague" is commonly used as a {{lang|la|[[totum pro parte]]}} to refer to either of the international courts that reside in the city.

==Etymology==
The Hague was first mentioned as ''Die Haghe'' in 1242.<ref name="ZH"/> In the 15th century, the name ''des Graven hage'' came into use, literally meaning "the Count's Grove", with connotations such as "hedge", "private enclosure" or "hunting grounds". The count in question was the [[Count of Holland]] (as is the case with nearby [['s-Gravenzande]]). 

The spelling ''{{'}}s-Gravenhage'' was officially used for the city from the 17th century onward. Today, this name is only used in some official documents such as birth and marriage certificates. The city itself uses ''Den Haag'' in all its communications.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1199/ |title='s-Gravenhage / Den Haag |publisher=Taaladvies.net |access-date=16 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116115237/http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1199/ |archive-date=16 January 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The post office specifies that letters should be addressed to ''{{'}}s-Gravenhage'', but a letter to ''Den Haag'' will be delivered just as well. The railway stations use the name ''Den Haag'', as do signposts.

== History ==
{{For timeline}}

=== Ancient history===
The area was part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Germania Inferior]] and was close to the border of the empire, the [[Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes]]. In 1997, four Roman milestones were discovered at Wateringse Veld. The originals are in the "[[Museon]]" museum. The milestones indicate the distance from the nearest Roman city, Forum Hadriani (modern [[Voorburg]]), and can be dated to the reign of the emperors [[Antoninus Pius]] (138–161; the column is dated 151), [[Caracalla]] (211–217), [[Gordian III]] (238–244), and [[Decius]] (249–251).

=== Early history ===
[[File:Joust on the Hofvijver, by Dutch School of the 17th century.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Binnenhof]] at the [[Hofvijver]], 1625]]

Little is known about the origin of The Hague. There are no contemporary documents describing it, and later sources are often of dubious reliability. What is certain is that The Hague was founded by the last counts of the [[House of Holland (nobility)|House of Holland]]. [[Floris IV]] already owned two residences in the area, but presumably purchased a third court situated by the present-day [[Hofvijver]] in 1229, previously owned by a woman called Meilendis. Presumably, Floris IV intended to rebuild the court into a large castle, but he died in a [[Tournament (medieval)|tournament]] in 1234, before anything was built.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://anemaa.home.xs4all.nl/ges/geschiedenis_den_haag_04a_florisiv.htm |title=De geschiedenis van den Haag: graaf Floris IV |website=Geschiedenis van Den Haag |language=nl |access-date=16 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424093819/http://anemaa.home.xs4all.nl/ges/geschiedenis_den_haag_04a_florisiv.htm |archive-date=24 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> His son and successor [[William II of Holland|William II]] lived in the court, and after he was elected [[King of the Romans]] in 1248, he promptly returned to The Hague, and had builders turn the court into a "royal palace" (''regale palacium''), which would later be called the [[Binnenhof]] ("Inner Court"). He died in 1256 before this palace was completed but parts of it were finished during the reign of his son [[Floris V, Count of Holland|Floris V]], of which the [[Ridderzaal]] ("Knights' Hall"), still intact, is the most prominent.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://anemaa.home.xs4all.nl/ges/geschiedenis_den_haag_04b_willemii.htm |title=Den Haag en graaf Willem II |website=Geschiedenis van Den Haag |language=nl |access-date=16 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424093824/http://anemaa.home.xs4all.nl/ges/geschiedenis_den_haag_04b_willemii.htm |archive-date=24 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://anemaa.home.xs4all.nl/ges/geschiedenis_den_haag_04d_bouw_binnenhof.htm |title=Het Binnenhof: ontstaat |website=Geschiedenis van Den Haag |language=nl |access-date=16 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424191019/http://anemaa.home.xs4all.nl/ges/geschiedenis_den_haag_04d_bouw_binnenhof.htm |archive-date=24 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> It is still used for political events, such as the annual [[speech from the throne]] by the Dutch [[monarch]]. From the 13th century onward, the counts of Holland used The Hague as their administrative center and residence when in Holland.

The village that originated around the Binnenhof was first mentioned as ''Die Haghe'' in a charter dating from 1242. It became the primary residence of the Counts of Holland in 1358 and thus became the seat of many government institutions. This status allowed the village to grow; by the Late Middle Ages, it had grown to the size of a city, although it did not [[City rights in the Low Countries|receive city rights]].<ref name=ZH>{{Cite web |url=https://geschiedenisvanzuidholland.nl/locatie/geschiedenis-van-den-haag |title=Geschiedenis van Den Haag |website=Geschiedenis van Zuid-Holland |language=nl |access-date=16 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616203832/https://geschiedenisvanzuidholland.nl/locatie/geschiedenis-van-den-haag |archive-date=16 June 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> In its early years, the village was in the ''[[wiktionary:ambacht#Dutch|ambacht]]'', or rural district, of [[Monster, South Holland|Monster]], which was governed by the Lord of Monster. Seeking to exercise more direct control over the village, however, the Count split the village off and created a separate ''ambacht'' called Haagambacht, governed directly by the Counts of Holland. The territory of Haagambacht was considerably expanded during the reign of Floris V.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://anemaa.home.xs4all.nl/ges/geschiedenis_den_haag_04e_die_haghe.htm |title=Het dorp Die Haghe: het ontstaan |website=Geschiedenis van Den Haag |language=nl |access-date=16 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424093832/http://anemaa.home.xs4all.nl/ges/geschiedenis_den_haag_04e_die_haghe.htm |archive-date=24 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

When the [[House of Burgundy]] inherited the counties of Holland and Zeeland in 1432, they appointed a [[stadtholder]] to rule in their stead with the [[States of Holland and West Friesland]] as an advisory council. Although their seat was in The Hague, the city became subordinate to more important centres of government such as [[Brussels]] and [[Mechelen]], from where the sovereigns ruled over the increasingly centralised [[Burgundian Netherlands]].<ref name=ZH/>

At the beginning of the [[Eighty Years' War]], the absence of city walls proved disastrous, as it allowed [[Spain|Spanish]] troops to easily occupy the town. In 1575, the States of Holland, temporarily based in [[Delft]], even considered demolishing the city but this proposal was abandoned, after mediation by [[William the Silent]]. In 1588, The Hague became the permanent seat of the States of Holland as well as the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] of the [[Dutch Republic]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.merkdenhaag.nl/de-allerkortste-geschiedenis-van-den-haag |title=De allerkortste geschiedenis van Den Haag |website=Merkboek Den Haag |language=nl |access-date=16 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616203831/https://www.merkdenhaag.nl/de-allerkortste-geschiedenis-van-den-haag |archive-date=16 June 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> For the administration to maintain control over city matters, The Hague never received official city status, although it did have many of the privileges normally granted only to cities. In modern administrative law, "city rights" have no place anymore.

=== Modern history ===
[[File:Den Haag - Stadhuis 1900.jpg|thumb|The [[Old City Hall (The Hague)|Old City Hall]] of The Hague around 1900]]
In 1806, when the [[Kingdom of Holland]] was a puppet state of the [[First French Empire]], the settlement was [[City rights in the Low Countries|granted city rights]] by [[Louis Bonaparte]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denhaag.nl/en/residents/news-and-events/press-room/to/A-short-history-of-The-Hague.htm |title=A short history of The Hague |date=28 November 2011 |website=Denhaag.nl |access-date=9 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413125843/http://www.denhaag.nl/en/residents/news-and-events/press-room/to/A-short-history-of-The-Hague.htm |archive-date=13 April 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], modern-day Belgium and the Netherlands were combined in the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] to form a buffer against France. As a compromise, [[Brussels]] and [[Amsterdam]] alternated as capital every two years, with the government remaining in The Hague. After the separation of Belgium in 1830, Amsterdam remained the capital of the Netherlands, while the government was situated in The Hague. When the government started to play a more prominent role in Dutch society after 1850, The Hague quickly expanded. Many streets were specifically built for the large number of civil servants employed in the country's government and for the Dutchmen who were retiring from the administration of the [[Netherlands East Indies]]. The growing city amalgamated the rural municipality of [[Loosduinen]] partly in 1903 and completely in 1923.<ref>{{Repertorium Nederlandse Gemeenten}}</ref>

The city sustained heavy damage during [[World War II]]. Many Jews were killed during the German occupation. Additionally, the [[Atlantic Wall]] was built through the city, causing a large quarter to be torn down by the [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupants. On 3 March 1945, the [[Royal Air Force]] mistakenly [[Bombing of the Bezuidenhout|bombed]] the [[Bezuidenhout]] quarter. The target was an installation of [[V-2 rocket]]s in the nearby [[Haagse Bos]] park, but because of navigational errors, the bombs fell on a heavily populated and historic part of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kb.nl/dossiers/geschiedenis/bombardement-op-bezuidenhout|title=Bombardement op Bezuidenhout maart 1945|trans-title=Bombing of the Bezuidenhout March 1945|publisher=[[National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]]|access-date=5 December 2013|language=nl|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215125838/http://www.kb.nl/dossiers/geschiedenis/bombardement-op-bezuidenhout|archive-date=15 December 2013}}</ref> The bombardment wreaked widespread destruction in the area<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_vQfUQxCjtMC&q=razed |title=The Low Countries: arts and society in Flanders and the Netherlands, a yearbook |volume=9 |author=Stichting Ons Erfdeel |year=1998 |publisher=Flemish-Netherlands Foundation |page=113 |isbn=9789075862287 |access-date=23 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617185656/https://books.google.com/books?ei=FcOXUtmIFYfwhQeC-4CgAQ&id=_vQfUQxCjtMC&dq=The+Low+Countries:+Arts+and+Society+in+Flanders+and+the+Netherlands,+a+Yearbook&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=razed |archive-date=17 June 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> and caused 511 fatalities.<ref>{{in lang|nl}} [http://kranten.kb.nl/view/article/id/ddd%3A010462560%3Ampeg21%3Ap008%3Aa0146 Bombardement Bezuidenhout 3 maart '45 Voor velen stortte in luttele minuten de wereld in elkaar] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215185333/http://kranten.kb.nl/view/article/id/ddd%3A010462560%3Ampeg21%3Ap008%3Aa0146 |date=15 December 2013 }}, Amigoe di Curacao, 4 March 1965</ref>

Because of uncertainty about what to do after the destructions of the bombing, nobody attempted to plan a reconstruction of Bezuidenhout. In 1962, David Jokinen saw an opportunity to put an end to the situation where two main stations each served only part of the rail traffic. The [[Jokinen Plan]] included the intent to demolish the [[Den Haag Centraal railway station#History|Staatsspoor Station]] entirely, with [[Hollands Spoor]] becoming the central station. Jokinen's plan sparked fierce discussions. The plan was not implemented, in part because it was only presented when decision-making had finally reached an advanced stage. In the site of the Staatsspoor station now stands the [[Den Haag Centraal railway station]].

After the war, The Hague became at one time the largest building site in [[Europe]]. The city expanded massively to the southwest, and the destroyed areas were quickly rebuilt. The population peaked at 600,000 inhabitants around 1965. In the 1970s and 1980s, mostly white middle-class families moved to neighbouring towns such as [[Voorburg]], [[Leidschendam]], [[Rijswijk]] and (most of all) [[Zoetermeer]]. This led to the traditional pattern of an impoverished inner city and more prosperous suburbs. Attempts to include parts of these municipalities in the city of The Hague were highly controversial. In the 1990s, with the consent of the Dutch Parliament, The Hague annexed fairly large areas from neighbouring towns as well as from not even bordering ones, on which the complete new residential areas were built and are still being built.

[[File:Netherlands, The Hague, Rembrandtstraat (01a).jpg|thumb|Rembrandt Street]]

The Hague is the largest Dutch city on the [[North Sea]] in the Netherlands and forms the centre of the [[COROP#South Holland province|Greater The Hague urban area]]. [[Westland (municipality), Netherlands|Westland]] and [[Wateringen]] lie to the south, [[Rijswijk]], [[Delft]] and the [[Rotterdam]] conurbation (known as ''[[Rijnmond]]'') to the southeast, [[Pijnacker-Nootdorp]] and [[Zoetermeer]] to the east, [[Leidschendam-Voorburg]], [[Voorschoten]] and the [[Leiden]] conurbation to the northeast and [[Wassenaar]] to the north.

The conurbations around The Hague and Rotterdam are close enough to be seen as a single conurbation in some contexts. For example, they share the [[Rotterdam The Hague Airport]] and a light rail system called [[RandstadRail]]. This led to the creation of the [[Rotterdam-The Hague metropolitan area]]. This large conurbation centred on The Hague and Rotterdam is, in turn, part of the [[Randstad]]—specifically a band of municipalities called the South Wing ([[Zuidvleugel]]). The Randstad, which also includes among others [[Amsterdam]] and [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], has a population of 6,659,300. The Hague lies at the southwestern corner of the [[List of metropolitan areas in Europe#Polycentric metropolitan areas in the European Union|second-largest conurbation in the European Union]].

The Hague is divided into eight official districts which are, in turn, divided into neighbourhoods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denhaag.nl/home/bewoners/stadsdelen-en-wijken/to/Stadsdelen-9.htm|title=Stadsdelen|date=18 October 2010|publisher=Denhaag.nl|language=nl|access-date=31 August 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928144925/http://www.denhaag.nl/home/bewoners/stadsdelen-en-wijken/to/Stadsdelen-9.htm|archive-date=28 September 2011}}</ref> Some of the most prosperous and some of the poorest neighbourhoods of the Netherlands can be found in The Hague. The wealthier areas such as [[Statenkwartier]], [[Belgisch Park]], [[Marlot]], [[Benoordenhout]] and [[The Hague Center#Archipelbuurt|Archipelbuurt]] are generally in the northwestern part of the city, closer to the sea, whereas the southeastern neighbourhoods such as [[The Hague Center#Transvaal|Transvaal]], [[Moerwijk]], and the [[Schilderswijk]] are significantly poorer, except the [[Vinex-location]]s of [[Leidschenveen-Ypenburg]] and [[Wateringse Veld]]. This division is reflected in the local accent: The more affluent citizens are usually called "Hagenaars" and speak so-called ''bekakt Haags'' ("posh"), this contrasts with the ''Hagenezen'', who speak ''plat Haags'' ("vulgar"); see [[#Demographics|Demographics]] below.

The districts are:
* [[The Hague Center|Centrum]] (110,000 inhabitants)<ref name=pop>[https://denhaag.incijfers.nl/Jive?workspace_guid=f17a1247-92b3-4c3c-b84c-dac23f1e5358 Den Haag in Cijfers] (in Dutch)</ref> forms the heart of The Hague. The [[Binnenhof]], the [[Noordeinde Palace]], the [[Mauritshuis]] museum, the [[Nieuwe Kerk (The Hague)|Nieuwe Kerk]], the [[Grote of Sint-Jacobskerk (The Hague)|Grote Kerk]], the [[Old City Hall (The Hague)|Old City Hall]] and the [[The Hague City Hall|City Hall]] are located here. Architecture varies from medieval up to the 20th century.
* [[Escamp]] (131,000 inhabitants)<ref name=pop/> is the most populous district of The Hague, built largely after the [[World War II]] as part of The Hague's large expansion to the southeast. One railway station can be found here: [[Den Haag Moerwijk railway station|Den Haag Moerwijk]]. The district is divided into six neighbourhoods.
* [[Haagse Hout]] (51,000 inhabitants)<ref name=pop/> is a wealthy district in the northeast of the city and the location of the [[Haagse Bos]], a large forest. The King of the Netherlands lives in the royal palace [[Huis ten Bosch]], in this forest. The district also includes the financial centre of the city, the [[Beatrixkwartier]].
* [[Laak, The Hague|Laak]] (46,000 inhabitants)<ref name=pop/> is the smallest district of the city, southeast of its centre, for the most part, built in the 20th and 21st centuries. The area used to be part of [[Rijswijk]] until the municipality of The Hague bought the land in 1844. The [[Den Haag Hollands Spoor railway station|Hollands Spoor]] railway station and [[The Hague University]] are located here, as well as the site of the planned mixed-use development [[Nieuw Binckhorst]].
* [[Leidschenveen-Ypenburg]] (48,000 inhabitants)<ref name=pop/> is an early 21st-century [[Vinex-location]] southeast of the city, geographically connected to the main body of the city [[Flagpole annexation|only by a narrow corridor]]. The district is divided into Leidschenveen and Ypenburg, which were part of [[Leidschendam]], [[Nootdorp]], and [[Rijswijk]] before the areas were annexed by The Hague in 2002. This area was the site of [[Ypenburg Airport]] which was a military airport during World War II.
* [[Loosduinen]] (53,000 inhabitants)<ref name=pop/> is the westernmost district of The Hague. It was a village unto itself until 1923 when it was annexed by The Hague. The less popular of the city's two seaside resorts, [[Kijkduin]] is located here. The district is divided into four neighbourhoods.
* [[Scheveningen]] (61,000 inhabitants)<ref name=pop/> is the wealthy northernmost district of The Hague. A modern beach resort, Scheveningen is a popular tourist destination. It has a long sandy beach and its own esplanade, pier, and lighthouse, but also a [[Pathé]] cinema, a musical theatre, a casino, and a special Museum for Scheveningen. The district also includes a fishing harbour. Notable buildings include the [[Kurhaus of Scheveningen|Kurhaus]] and farther inland, the [[Peace Palace]].
* [[Segbroek]] (63,000 inhabitants)<ref name=pop/> is a district located between Scheveningen and Loosduinen. The population decreased until around 2005, but since then has begun to grow again, driven by students and east European immigrants. It became a district of The Hague in 1988 and is divided into five neighbourhoods.

=== Climate ===
The Hague experiences a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen:]] ''Cfb'') similar to almost all of the Netherlands. Because of its location on the coast, it experiences milder winters and cooler summers than more inland locations. However, because of its location, it can also be extremely windy in the winter and humid in the summer. It also gets more sunshine.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

City life concentrates around the [[Hofvijver]] and the [[Binnenhof]], where the States General of the Netherlands is located. Because of its history, the historical inner city of The Hague differs in various aspects from the nearby smaller cities of [[Leiden]] and [[Delft]]. It does not have a cramped inner city, bordered by canals and walls. Instead, it has some small streets in the town centre that may be dated from the late [[Middle Ages]] and several spacious streets boasting large and luxurious 18th-century residences built for diplomats and affluent Dutch families. It has a large church dating from the 15th century, a [[Old City Hall (The Hague)|City Hall]] (built as such) from the 16th century, several large 17th-century palaces, a 17th-century [[Protestant]] church built in what was then a modern style, and many important 18th-century buildings.

The city is becoming more student-friendly with the introduction of a new campus in 2012 of [[Leiden University]] as well as [[Leiden University College The Hague]], which was established in 2010. The [[Royal Conservatory of The Hague]] and the [[Royal Academy of Art (The Hague)|Royal Academy of Art]] are also located there, as well as [[The Hague University]], a [[vocational university]] and a branch of The [[Open University of the Netherlands]]. The city has many [[civil servant]]s and [[diplomat]]s.<ref name="denh_Dipl">{{Cite web |title=Diplomatic Corps and embassies |last=Haag |first=Den |work=Gemeente Den Haag |access-date=27 February 2019 |url=https://www.denhaag.nl/en/in-the-city/international-the-hague/diplomatic-corps-and-embassies.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228065846/https://www.denhaag.nl/en/in-the-city/international-the-hague/diplomatic-corps-and-embassies.htm |archive-date=28 February 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In fact, the number and variety of foreign residents (especially the [[expatriate]]s) make the city quite culturally diverse, with many foreign [[pub]]s, shops and cultural events.

The Hague is the largest Dutch city on the [[North Sea]] and includes two distinct [[beach resort]]s. The main beach resort [[Scheveningen]], in the northwestern part of the city, is a popular destination for tourists as well as for inhabitants. With 10&nbsp;million visitors a year, it is the most popular beach town in the [[Benelux]] area. [[Kijkduin]], in the southwest, is The Hague's other beach resort. It is significantly smaller and attracts mainly local residents.

The former Dutch colony of the [[Dutch East Indies|East Indies]], now [[Indonesia]], has left its mark on The Hague. Since the 19th century, high-level civil servants from the Dutch East Indies often spent long-term leave and vacations in The Hague. Many streets are named after places in the Netherlands East Indies (as well as other former Dutch colonies such as Suriname) and there is a sizable "[[Indo people|Indo]]" (i.e. mixed Dutch-Indonesian) community. Since the loss of these Dutch possessions in December 1949, "[[Indo people]]" also known as "Indische people" often refer to The Hague as "the Widow of the Indies".<ref>Dutch: 'de Weduwe van Indie'. As per song text by the famous singer [[Wieteke van Dort]], see text of the song "Arm Den Haag" ("Pity The Hague"): [http://www.muzikum.eu/nl/123-1151-22012/wieteke_van_dort/arm_den_haag-songtekst.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720165653/http://www.muzikum.eu/nl/123-1151-22012/wieteke_van_dort/arm_den_haag-songtekst.html|date=20 July 2011}}</ref>

The older parts of the town have many characteristically wide and long streets. Houses are generally low-rise (often not more than three floors). A large part of the southwestern city was planned by the progressive Dutch architect [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage|H.P. Berlage]] about 1910. This 'Plan Berlage' decided the spacious and homely streets for several decades. In World War II, a large amount of the western portion of The Hague was destroyed by the Germans. Afterward, modernist architect [[Willem Marinus Dudok|W.M. Dudok]] planned its renewal, putting apartment blocks for the middle class in open park-like settings.

The layout of the city is more spacious than other Dutch cities and because of the incorporation of large and old nobility estates, the creation of various parks, and the use of green zones around natural streams, it is a much more green city than any other in the Netherlands. That is, excepting some medieval close-knitted streets in the centre. The Hague has a canal system around the old city center, which is mainly used for boat tours around the city. Most of the canals were drained in the late 19th century and some were filled between 1910 and 1970<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mvrdv.com/projects/407/the-hague-canals|title= The Hague Canals|website=MVRDV }}</ref> but many have been restored recently.{{when|date=July 2023}}

The tallest buildings of The Hague are both 146-meter-tall ministries of [[Ministry of Justice and Security|Justice and Security]] and the [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Interior and Kingdom Relations]] of the Netherlands, designed by [[Hans Kollhoff]]. Other significant skyscrapers include the [[Hoftoren]], [[Het Strijkijzer]] and [[De Kroon (The Hague)|De Kroon]].

As of 1 January 2021, The Hague counts 549,163 inhabitants, making it the third-largest city in the Netherlands. Between 1800 and 1960, the city saw considerable growth from 40,000 in 1800 to 200,000 in 1900 and eventually 600,000 in 1960. The growth following 1900 was partially caused by the housing act of 1901, which stimulated the expansion of cities such as The Hague. In the period between 1960 and 1980, The Hague saw a shrinkage from 600,000 to 440,000 inhabitants, caused mostly by spatial policy, demographic processes, and lack of space. After several annexations and housing constructions, The Hague has since grown again, celebrating its 500,000th inhabitant in 2011. The municipality expects the growth to continue to just over 600,000 inhabitants by 2030.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://denhaag.incijfers.nl/Jive?workspace_guid=c2afd650-eebf-4a7c-a24d-692a114c1edb |title=Aantal personen prognose WBP - Gemeenten |website=Den Haag in Cijfers |access-date=7 February 2022 |language=nl}}</ref>

The Hague is home to many different international judicial bodies, such as the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ), the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), and the [[International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals]] (IRMCT).

The foundation of The Hague as an [[Hague Justice Portal|"international city of peace and justice"]] started at the end of the 19th century, when [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|the first global peace conference]] took place in The Hague on [[Tobias Asser]]'s initiative, with a second one a few years later. A direct result of these meetings was the establishment of the world's first organisation for the settlement of international disputes, the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] (PCA). Shortly thereafter, the Scottish-American millionaire [[Andrew Carnegie]] made the necessary funds available to build the [[Peace Palace]] to house the PCA. After the establishment of the [[League of Nations]], The Hague became the seat of the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]], which was replaced (after [[World War II]]) by the UN's [[International Court of Justice]]. The establishments of the [[Iran–United States Claims Tribunal]] (1981), the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (1993), and the [[International Criminal Court]] (2002) in the city further consolidated its role as a centre for international legal arbitration. Most recently, on 1 March 2009, the [[Special Tribunal for Lebanon]], a UN tribunal to investigate and prosecute suspects in the 2005 assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, opened in the former headquarters of the Dutch [[General Intelligence and Security Service]] in [[Leidschendam]], a town within the greater area of The Hague.

Other major international and European organisations based in The Hague include:

* [[Europol]], European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation
* [[Eurojust]], European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation
* [[Europeana]], European Union digital platform for cultural heritage.
* [[The Hague Academy of International Law]], centre for high-level education in both public and private international law
* [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]] (HCCH), the oldest and preeminent private international law harmonisation institution
* [[International Commission on Missing Persons]] (ICMP)
* [[European Patent Office]]
* [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]]
* [[NATO Communications and Information Agency]], (NCI Agency)
* [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]] (OPCW)

Many academic institutions in the fields of international relations, international law, and international development are based in The Hague. The [[Hague Academic Coalition]] (HAC) is a consortium of those institutions.

Its member institutions are:
* [[Carnegie Foundation (Netherlands)|Carnegie Foundation]]
* [[Hague Institute for the Internationalisation of Law]] (HiiL)
* [[International Institute of Social Studies]] (ISS) of [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]]
* [[Leiden University College The Hague]]

* [[The Hague Academy of International Law]]
* [[The Hague University of Applied Sciences]]
* [[T.M.C. Asser Instituut]]

In 1948, the [[Congress of Europe]] was held with 750 delegates from 26 European governments, providing them with the opportunity to discuss ideas about the development of [[European integration]], which eventually culminated in the creation of the modern-day [[European Union]].

== Economy ==
[[File:RandstadRail Den Haag netkous.jpg|thumb|The Hague's central financial district, [[Beatrixkwartier]], with the modern tram viaduct called the ''{{lang|nl|Netkous}}'' ("[[Fishnet stocking]]")]]

The Hague has a [[Service economy|service-oriented]] economy. A professional life in the city is dominated by a large number of civil servants and diplomats working in the city; {{As of|2006|lc=y}}, 26% of the jobs in The Hague are those offered by the Dutch government or the international institutions. Large employers in this sector include the ministries of [[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Defence]], [[Ministry of Justice and Security|Justice]], [[Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (Netherlands)|Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment]], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands)|Foreign Affairs]], the [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations]] and [[Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management (Netherlands)|Transport, Public Works and Water Management]].

Several large international businesses have their headquarters in The Hague. Significant companies headquartered in The Hague include [[Aegon N.V.|Aegon]], [[APM Terminals]], [[Damco]], [[NIBC Bank]], [[Chicago Bridge & Iron Company]] and [[PostNL]]. The city is also host to the regional headquarters of [[Siemens]], [[T-Mobile International AG|T-Mobile]], [[AT&T]], [[Huawei]], [[Kuwait Petroleum Corporation]], [[McDermott International]], [[Saudi Aramco]], [[TotalEnergies]] and [[Worley (company)|Worley]]. There has never been any large-scale industrial activity in The Hague, with the possible exception of the fishing activities of the harbour in [[Scheveningen]]. Many of the city's logistical and minor-industrial services are in the Binckhorst in the Laak district, which contains many sizeable warehouses.

Tourism is an important sector in The Hague. The city is the second biggest [[Netherlands|Dutch]] tourist destination, after [[Amsterdam]]. In 2012, The Hague welcomed 1.2&nbsp;million tourists (an increase of 80,000 compared to the previous year), half of whom came from abroad. The number of hotel nights in the city increased by 5%; in particular, visitors from neighbouring countries are finding their way to The Hague. Compared to 2011 Belgians booked 27% more hotel nights, while the Germans were good for 24% more hotel nights, and the French booked 20% more hotel nights. The 14% average increase in visits by foreign tourists more than compensated for the slight decrease of less than 1% by Dutch visitors. Tourists spend an average of €2&nbsp;billion a year in the local economy. Today 1 in 10 residents make their living in the tourism sector.<ref>[http://denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/More-tourists-visiting-The-Hague.htm More tourists visiting The Hague] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191319/http://denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/More-tourists-visiting-The-Hague.htm |date=29 October 2013 }}.

== Culture ==
{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2022}}
The Hague originated around the 13th century [[Binnenhof]], and this is still considered the cultural centre of the city. Nightlife centres around the three main squares in the city centre. The ''[[Plein, The Hague|Plein]]'' (literally "Square") is taken by several large sidewalk cafés where often politicians may be spotted. The ''Grote Markt'' (literally "Great Market") is completely strewn with chairs and tables, summer or winter. The [[Buitenhof (The Hague)|Buitenhof]] (literally "Outer Court", located just outside the [[Binnenhof]]) contains a six-screen [[Pathé]] cinema and a handful of bars and restaurants in the immediate vicinity. Adjacent to the Buitenhof is [[De Passage]], the country's first covered shopping mall. Dating from the late 19th century,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://denhaag.com/en/passage|title=Passage &#124; DenHaag.com|website=denhaag.com}}</ref> it contains many expensive and speciality shops. One of the country's largest music venues, [[Paard van Troje]], can be found in the centre of The Hague. Another popular music venue in The Hague is Muziekcafé de Paap.

[[File:Koninklijke Schouwburg Den Haag.jpg|thumb|The [[Koninklijke Schouwburg]], home to [[Het Nationale Theater]]]]
The Spuiplein is a modern fourth square in the city centre, opposite the [[Nieuwe Kerk (The Hague)|Nieuwe Kerk]]. Besides the [[The Hague City Hall|City Hall]], this was also the location of the [[Anton Philipszaal]], home to the [[Residentie Orchestra]], and the [[Lucent Danstheater]], home to the internationally celebrated modern dance company [[Nederlands Dans Theater]]. These buildings, designed by [[Rem Koolhaas]] in 1988, have been demolished to make space for a new theatre, [[Amare (theatre)|Amare]], which would house both institutes as well as the [[Royal Conservatory of The Hague|Royal Conservatory]]. Despite efforts of the municipality, public support for the proposed theatre remains low. At the heart of the city centre across the palace gardens is the home of [[Summerschool Den Haag]], an international school for dance with guest teachers such as [[Valentina Scaglia]], [[Igone de Jongh]], and [[Maia Makhateli]]. The [[Koninklijke Schouwburg]], home to [[Het Nationale Theater]], can also be found in the city centre – on the Korte Voorhout. [[New European Ensemble]] is a collective for [[contemporary music]] consisting on international musicians. The ensemble has its main base in the city.

[[Scheveningen]] forms a second cultural centre of The Hague, having its own [[Pathé]] cinema as well as the musical theatre [[Circustheater]] although, especially in the summer, most night life concentrates around the sea-front boulevard with its bars, restaurants and gambling halls. Several other attractions can be found in Scheveningen, such as the miniature park [[Madurodam]], the [[Beelden aan Zee]] museum, and a [[Sea Life Centres|Sea Life Centre]].

The Hague is the residence of the Dutch monarch, and several (former) royal palaces can be found in the city. King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands]] and Queen [[Máxima of the Netherlands]] live in [[Huis ten Bosch]] in the [[Haagse Bos]] and work in the [[Noordeinde Palace]] in the city centre. Moreover, there are two former royal palaces in The Hague. The [[Kneuterdijk Palace]], built in 1716, is now home to the [[Council of State of the Netherlands]], and the Lange Voorhout Palace is now occupied by the [[Escher Museum]], dedicated to Dutch graphical artist [[M. C. Escher]].

[[File:2010-05-22-den-haag-by-RalfR-48.jpg|thumb|[[Mauritshuis]]]]
The Hague has its share of museums, most notably the [[Mauritshuis]], located next to the Binnenhof, which exhibits many [[painting]]s by Dutch masters, such as [[Johannes Vermeer]], [[Rembrandt van Rijn]] and [[Paulus Potter]]. Other museums include the science museum [[Museon]], the modern art museum [[Gemeentemuseum Den Haag|Kunstmuseum]], the historic museum [[Haags Historisch Museum]], the national postal museum [[Museum voor Communicatie]], the [[Museum Bredius]], the [[Louis Couperus Museum]], the museum [[Beelden aan Zee]] in [[Scheveningen]], [[Panorama Mesdag]], and the [[Gevangenpoort]], a former prison housed in a 15th-century gatehouse.

Since early times, possibly as far back as the 16th century, the [[stork]] has been the symbol of The Hague.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denhaag.nl/home/bewoners/to/Haagse-weetjes.htm |title=Den Haag – Haagse weetjes |publisher=Denhaag.nl |date=12 July 2010 |access-date=16 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602153030/http://www.denhaag.nl/home/bewoners/to/Haagse-weetjes.htm |archive-date=2 June 2016 }}</ref>

=== Annual events ===
[[Koningsdag]], or ''King's Day'', is held annually on 27 April. It is traditionally celebrated with fairs and flea markets throughout the city. On this day, the colour orange predominates at a [[funfair]] (which sells orange [[cotton candy]]) and scores of informal street markets. The day is a ''vrijmarkt'' (literally "free market"), which means no licence is needed for street vending; children traditionally use this day to sell old unwanted toys. Since King's Day is a national holiday and thus a day off, many people also go out and party on the evening before King's Day. This evening is called King's Night, or ''Koningnacht'' in The Hague. The "t" is left out because ''nacht'' is pronounced as ''nach'' in The Hague. Outdoor concerts throughout the city centre of The Hague draw tens of thousands of visitors every year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/Kings-Day-Koningsdag.htm |title=King's Day (Koningsdag) |date=11 November 2013 |website=Denhaag.nl |access-date=19 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419221344/http://en.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/Kings-Day-Koningsdag.htm |archive-date=19 April 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/The-Hague-turns-Orange-on-Kings-Day.htm |title=The Hague turns Orange on King's Day!) |date=26 March 2014 |website=Denhaag.nl |access-date=19 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419224259/http://en.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/The-Hague-turns-Orange-on-Kings-Day.htm |archive-date=19 April 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Every third Tuesday in September is {{Lang|nl|[[Prinsjesdag]]|italic=no}}, or ''Prince's Day'', the opening of the Dutch parliament. On a festive day, children in The Hague are free from school so they may watch the procession of the [[Golden Coach (Netherlands)|Golden Coach]]. The King is driven in the coach from [[Noordeinde Palace]] to the [[Ridderzaal]] in the [[Binnenhof]]. Here, the King reads the [[Speech from the Throne]], written jointly by the Ministers and Secretaries of State. This ''troonrede'' outlines the government's plans for the coming year. As the procession returns to the Noordeinde Palace, the road is lined with members of the Dutch Royal Armed Forces, and in the afternoon, the Royal Family appears on the palace balcony to address an adoring and often frenzied public (''balkonscène'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/Princes-Day-Prinsjesdag.htm |title=Prince's Day (Prinsjesdag) |date=26 August 2013 |website=Denhaag.nl |access-date=19 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419220113/http://en.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/Princes-Day-Prinsjesdag.htm |archive-date=19 April 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[Vlaggetjesdag]] ([[:nl:Vlaggetjesdag|nl]]), literally ''Flag Day'', is the annual celebration of the arrival of the year's first herring (Hollandse Nieuwe) in [[Scheveningen]]. Hundreds of thousands of people gather in Scheveningen for the festivities, and the fishing boats are decorated specially for the occasion. In addition to the omnipresent herring, this day also features several activities unrelated to fish. In Scheveningen, the first barrel of herring is traditionally sold at an auction on the Thursday preceding the official Vlaggetjesdag, and the proceeds go to charity. Vlaggetjesdag was made official in 1947, although the festive tradition around the beginning of herring season is much older: in the 18th century, the villages along the coast, including Scheveningen, were forbidden to gut the caught herring. Since herring was most appropriate for smoking around September, most fishing boats caught flatfish or round-bodied fish during part of the summer, to avoid a surplus of fresh herring.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/Flag-Day-Vlaggetjesdag.htm |title=Vlaggetjesdag (Flag Day) |date=19 July 2013 |website=Denhaag.nl |access-date=19 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419214619/http://en.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/Flag-Day-Vlaggetjesdag.htm |archive-date=19 April 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In July or August, The Hague hosts a series of weekly firework displays by the sea front in [[Scheveningen]], as part of an international fireworks festival and competition.

[[Tong Tong Fair]], formerly ''Pasar Malam Besar'', is the largest festival in the world for [[Indo people|Indo]] culture. Established in 1959, it is one of the oldest festivals and the fourth-largest grand fair in the Netherlands. It is also the annual event with the highest number of paying visitors to The Hague, having consistently attracted more than 100,000 visitors since 1993. The Milan Festival is Europe's biggest Hindustani open-air event, annually held in [[Zuiderpark]]. The Hague also hosts several annual music festivals; on the last Sunday in June, the city hosts [[Parkpop]], the largest free open-air pop concert in Europe. [[Crossing Border Festival]], [[State-X]] and [[The Hague Jazz]] festival are among other music festivals in The Hague.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/Music-City-The-Hague-5.htm |title=Music City The Hague |date=23 August 2012 |website=Denhaag.nl |access-date=19 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419214407/http://en.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/Music-City-The-Hague-5.htm |archive-date=19 April 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[Crossing Border Festival]] is an annual festival in November, focusing on music and literature.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://crossingborder.nl/ |title=Crossing Border Festival |access-date=5 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915044439/http://crossingborder.nl/ |archive-date=15 September 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The first edition took place in 1993.

The first such event took place in 2006.

Moreover, The Hague International Model United Nations, annually held in January, is a five-day conference held at the [[World Forum (The Hague)|World Forum]], gathering over 4,000 students from over 200 secondary schools across the globe. It is the oldest and largest high school [[United Nations]] simulation in the world. ''Den Haag Sculptuur'' is an open-air exhibition of sculptures; the tenth such event, in 2007, celebrated the 400 years of the [[Australia–Netherlands relations|relationship between the Netherlands and Australia]]. Since 2009, the city of The Hague also annually presents an [[LGBT social movements|LGBTQ+ emancipation]] award, called the [[John Blankenstein Award]].

===Air===
The Hague shares an [[Rotterdam The Hague Airport|airport]] with [[Rotterdam]]. It can be reached from Central Station by [[RandstadRail]] Line E, with an Airport Shuttle to and from [[Meijersplein RandstadRail station|Meijersplein Station]]. However, with several direct trains per hour from the railway stations Hollands Spoor and Centraal, [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]] is more frequently used by people travelling to and from The Hague by air.

===Rail===
[[File:Den Haag - Station Holland Spoor v1.JPG|thumb|View of Hollands Spoor]]

There are two main [[railway station]]s in The Hague: [[Den Haag HS railway station|Hollands Spoor]] and [[Den Haag Centraal railway station|Centraal Station]], {{convert|1.5|km|0|abbr=on}} apart from each other. Because the two stations were built and run by two different railway companies in the 19th century, services have traditionally been split between the two: east–west lines terminate at Centraal Station, whereas north–south lines run through Hollands Spoor. However, Centraal Station now offers direct services to most major Dutch cities, such as [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], and [[Utrecht]].

Other destinations include [[Leiden]], [[Haarlem]], [[Zwolle]], [[Groningen]], [[Leeuwarden]], [[Amersfoort]], [[Enschede]], [[Breda]], [[Tilburg]] and [[Eindhoven]]. International travellers for [[Antwerp]] and [[Brussels]] have to change trains at Rotterdam.

===Urban transport===
Public transport in The Hague consists of [[Trams in The Hague|a tramway network]] and a sizeable number of bus routes, operated by [[HTM Personenvervoer]].<ref>[http://www.htm.net/smartsite.dws?id=169 Public transport map] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520163149/http://www.htm.net/smartsite.dws?id=169 |date=20 May 2009 }} (from [[HTM Personenvervoer|HTM]])</ref> Plans for a subway were shelved in the early 1970s. However, in 2004 a tunnel was built under the city centre with two underground tram stations ([[Spui RandstadRail station|Spui]] and [[Grote Markt RandstadRail station|Grote Markt]]); it is shared by RandstadRail lines 3 and 4 and tram routes 2 and 6.

[[RandstadRail]] connects The Hague to nearby cities, Zoetermeer, Rotterdam, and Leidschendam-Voorburg. It consists of four light rail lines (3, 4, and 19 to Zoetermeer, Rijswijk, Delft, and Leidschendam-Voorburg) and one subway line (E to Rotterdam).

===Road===
Major motorways connecting to The Hague include the [[A12 motorway (Netherlands)|A12]], running to Utrecht and the German border. The A12 runs directly into the heart of the city in a cutting. Built in the 1970s, this section of the motorway (the "Utrechtsebaan") is now heavily overburdened. Plans were made in the late 1990s for a second artery road into the city (the "Rotterdamsebaan", previously called the "Trekvliettracé") which was completed in 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wegenwiki.nl/Rotterdamsebaan|title=Rotterdamsebaan – Wegenwiki|website=www.wegenwiki.nl|access-date=2 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005015024/http://www.wegenwiki.nl/Rotterdamsebaan|archive-date=5 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Other connecting motorways are the [[A4 motorway (Netherlands)|A4]], which connects the city with [[Amsterdam]], and the [[A13 motorway (Netherlands)|A13]], which runs to [[Rotterdam]] and connects to motorways towards the Belgian border. There is also the [[A44 motorway (Netherlands)|A44]] that connects the city to [[Leiden]], [[Haarlem]] and [[Amsterdam]]. In the 1970s, plans of building another motorway to Leiden existed. This "Leidsebaan" was supposed to start in the city centre and then follow the railway line from The Hague to Amsterdam. Some works had been executed but had been removed by the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}
