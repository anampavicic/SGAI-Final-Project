'''Mokpo''' ({{Korean|hangul=목포}}; {{IPA|ko|mok̚.pʰo}}) is the [[List of cities in South Korea|third largest]] and most densely populated city in [[Jeollanam-do|South Jeolla Province]], [[South Korea]], located at the southwestern tip of the [[Korean Peninsula]], close to [[Yudal mountain]]. Mokpo has frequent high-speed train services to [[Seoul]], and is the terminus for a number of ferry routes serving islands in the adjacent [[Yellow Sea]] and [[Dadohaehaesang National Park|Dadohae National Maritime Park]]. To the southwest of the city is [[Yudalsan]] Mountain, which is surrounded by strange cliffs like a wall. There are six manned and five uninhabited islands.<ref>{{Cite web |title=General Information |url=https://www.mokpo.go.kr/eng/about/information |website=Mokpo City}}</ref>

The Mokpo Special Tourist Zone covers 6.9&nbsp;km from the northern port to Yudalsan, Old Town Area, Samhakdo, and [[Gatbawi]]. It is home to attractions such as the Mokpo Natural History Museum and the [[National Maritime Museum]]. To live up to its name as a coastal city, the city's traditional dishes include a variety of [[seafood dishes]], including raw croaker, braised hairtail, skate, and seasoned crab.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mokpo Special Tourist Zone (목포 관광특구) |url=https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/svc/whereToGo/locIntrdn/locIntrdnList.do?vcontsId=74267&menuSn=351 |website=[[Korea Tourism Organization]]}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Mokpo'' means literally "tree harbor". This terminology initially appeared in the ''[[Goryeosa]]'' (''History of Goryeo''). Therefore, some historians argue that the city's name referred to trees within the region of the port of Mokpo. Another theory suggests that the "mok" in the city's name refers to "the throat," a metaphor for the importance of the city's location as an entrance to the [[Yellow Sea]].<ref>{{cite book|script-title=ko:우리나라 문화여행 알면 재미있고 모르면 후회하는|trans-title=Korean cultural tour: It's fun if you know, regret if you don't|year=2005|publisher=Geoin Publishing|author=Park Young-soo|language=ko}}{{page needed|date=August 2022}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Mahan and Three Kingdoms eras ===
Mokpo belonged to the [[Mahan confederacy]] during the early era of the three Han confederacies during the [[Samhan]] period, and was called Mul'ahye-gun while under the control of the [[Baekje]] kingdom. After [[Silla]] defeated Baekje, Mokpo's region was absorbed, and its name was changed to Myeonju. In 946, its name was once again changed to Mullyang-gun, and it became part of the Muan prefecture, in the Haeyang province. At the time, the prefecture of Muan referred to a much larger area, which incorporated not only Mokpo but also the area currently called [[Muan]] and several islands of [[Sinan, Jeollanam-do|Sinan county]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tour.mokpo.go.kr/ |title=Tour and Culture of Mokpo, Mokpo city hall |access-date=8 April 2011 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150412061544/http://tour.mokpo.go.kr/ |archive-date=12 April 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to a [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] documentary, coastal and offshore areas of Mokpo witnessed superior productivity of crops, and important shipping routes to [[Naju]] were established along the Yeongsan River.<ref>{{cite book|script-title=ko:역사스페셜2|trans-title=History Special 2|publisher=Hyohyeong Publishing|author=KBS History Special Team|year=2001|page=48|language=ko}}</ref>

=== Goryeo and Joseon dynasties ===
[[File:Statue of Admiral Yi Sun-sin in Mokpo, South Korea - 2011.jpg|thumb|left|To commemorate his role in the region's history, a statue of Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]] now stands guard over Mokpo.]]What is today known as Mokpo had its origins in the [[Goryeo dynasty|Goryeo period]]. That dynasty's founder, [[Taejo of Goryeo|Wang Geon]], was serving as a general for [[later Goguryeo]] (also known as [[Taebong]]), ruled by [[Gung Ye]]. Taebong covered the central area of the Korean peninsula including current-day [[Gaeseong]], which was then called Song'ak.

As a naval power, [[Wang Geon]] was ordered to attack the kingdom of [[Later Baekje]], which, like later Goguryeo, was a kingdom which emerged after the disintegration of [[Unified Silla]]. The operation met fairly successful results. During this time, Wang Geon met his second queen, [[Queen Janghwa]], with whom he had a son, who eventually became [[Hyejong of Goryeo]].

In 1439, 21 years after King [[Sejong]] of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] came to power, the Mokpo garrison (jin) was established, which was designed to control twelve offshore islands. During the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)]], Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]] established a garrison of naval forces at Mokpo and the island of Goha, to secure a base for provisions and ship repairs, such as the [[turtle ship]]s, also known as the [[geobukseon]] and [[panokseon]].<ref>{{cite book|script-title=ko:이순신이 싸운 바다:한려수도|author=Bongoso Lee|page=217|trans-title=Hallyeosudo: The sea where Yi Sun-sin fought|date=2004|language=ko}}</ref>

=== Open port ===
On 1 October 1897, Mokpo became an open port, fifteen years after the opening of the port of [[Incheon]]. For Japan, Mokpo held a geographical advantage being located midway between [[Nagasaki]], Japan, and the [[Chinese mainland]]. Japan also valued Mokpo for its proximity to the abundant crops of the [[Jeolla]] provinces. After its opening, housing for Japanese settlers was rapidly developed to establish self-government.<ref>{{cite book|script-title=ko:한국의 쓰레기 2천년사|trans-title=2000 Years of Trash in Korea|author=Son Young-bae|publisher=Jisa Moon|year=1997|language=ko}}{{page needed|date=August 2022}}</ref> The Japanese settled predominately in what is today the Yudal-dong neighborhood, close to the main port. The Japanese consulate remained there until the establishment of the Japanese [[Japan-Korea Treaty of 1905|protectorate over Korea]].

The Japanese settlers gradually bought farmland in the vicinity of Mokpo, which had previously been illegal. These agricultural fields were desirable because they were inexpensive and not heavily taxed. The resulting harvests from these fields made rice cheaper in Japan, although the price of rice in Jeolla province doubled as a result.<ref>{{cite book|script-title=ko:해방(테마로 읽는 20세기 한국사)》|trans-title=Liberation (20c Korean history based on themes)|author=KBS Documentary Liberation Production Team|translator=Hanmin|year=2000|pages=18, 20|language=ko}}</ref> After 1905, the influx of Japanese settlers increased and they expanded into Geumhwa-dong, where many cherry trees were planted along the street. Japanese called this area "Sakuramachi", which means "the downtown of cherry blossom trees."<ref>{{cite book|script-title=ko:매춘의 역사|trans-title=History of Prostitution|author=Hong Seong Chul|translator=Seo Seok-yeon|year=1992|publisher=magpie|page=101|language=ko}}</ref> With Korea's full annexation by Japan in 1910, the city was given a new name, Mokpo-bu, and saw the construction of the colonial institution, the [[Oriental Development Company]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=EnCyber|title=History of Mokpo|publisher=[[Doosan Encyclopedia]]|language=ko}}</ref>

=== Under Japanese rule ===
{{See also|Korea under Japanese rule}}
Mokpo's status as an open port made it a viable option to use the nearby county of [[Wando County|Wando]] as a link to the region's many offshore islands. In 1914, the completion of the [[Honam Line|Honam railway line]] connected the city to [[Daejeon]]. On 1 April 1914, the county of Mokpo-bu was divided into several administrative sections. Only the county's urban downtown area, Bunae-myeon, became what is today Mokpo City. Following Order Number 11 of the General Japanese Government of Korea, Muan county incorporated Jido, Palguem, and Docho, which were the other areas formerly comprising Mokpo-bu. During the Japanese colonial period, Mokpo's harbor was used to forcibly export the produce of the region.

In 1918, the colonists established ginning facilities for manufacturing large amounts of goods in both Mokpo and Iri (current [[Iksan]] in North Jeolla province).<ref>{{cite book|script-title=ko:«지방경제의 이해»|trans-title=Understanding the local economy|author1=Choi Nak Yeon (최낙연)|author2=Youngsa Park (박영사) |page=118|year=2003|url={{Google books|eVc2AQAAIAAJ|plainurl=yes}}|isbn=9788910204190|publisher=Pro-Insight International (博英社)|language=ko}}</ref> In 1932, the city incorporated parts of Muan, becoming the 6th largest city in the [[Korean peninsula]] with a population of 60,000. Indigenous products were cloth, rice, salt, and coastal foods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eng.mokpo.go.kr/home/eng/introduction/history/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054632/http://eng.mokpo.go.kr/home/eng/introduction/history/|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 September 2013|title=History of Mokpo}}{{dead link|date=August 2022}}</ref> The harbor played an important role, supplying goods to Japan, including large quantities of cotton.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dna.naver.com/viewer/index.nhn?articleId=1935060500209206001&editNo=2&printCount=1&publishDate=1935-06-05&officeId=00020&pageNo=6&printNo=5211&publishType=00020&doNotReadAnyMore=notClose|author=Kim Hyuk Phil|title=Practical profits in joint market policy in Joseon|date=5 June 1935|publisher=[[The Dong-a Ilbo]]|access-date=2011-05-10|via=News library service powered by NHN}}{{dead link|date=August 2022}}</ref>

=== After independence ===
In 1949, Mokpo-Bu was redesignated Mokpo City, after the government altered the administrative region. In 1973 and 1987, large areas were added to Mokpo city, including one of the most famous tourist spots, Samhakdo (Three Crane Island). Samhakdo was reclaimed by connecting a series of islands, a process of landfill operations which lasted from 1968 to 1973. The island is divided into three major sections, and over six years the city constructed five bridges to link those three sections. In 2000, the city initiated a plan to restore a naturalized island for tourism, which brought tremendous criticism from environmental groups. On 1 March 2007, Samhakdo was opened to the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=102&oid=001&aid=0001158582 |script-title=ko:옛 삼학도 모습|trans-title=The old three-year-old|date=2005-11-25|publisher=News Naver|access-date=2022-08-28|language=ko}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=102&oid=003&aid=0000330208 |script-title=ko:목포 삼학도 35년만에 복원...1일 개방|trans-title=Mokpo Samhakdo restored after 35 years...

In 1980, the [[Gwangju Democratization Movement]] swept the area. In Mokpo, student movements were initiated by several people marching along the boulevard from [[Mokpo Station]] to the second plaza, carrying cards displaying the word "Freedom." Mokpo Station served as a hub for many groups supporting the people of Gwangju.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://eng.518.org/eng/html/main.html?act=dtl&TM18MF=05020000&idx=417&page=1 |title=5.18 Memorial Foundation |access-date=9 April 2011 |archive-date=3 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303062453/http://eng.518.org/eng/html/main.html?act=dtl&TM18MF=05020000&idx=417&page=1 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On 1 October 1997, Mokpo celebrated its centennial as a port city, and announced the second opening of the port. Mokpo is the hometown of former President [[Kim Dae-jung]], who received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2000/index.html|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 2000|date=2000|publisher=The Nobel Prize|access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref>

Following the [[sinking of MV Sewol]] on 16 April 2014, the ship was moved to Mokpo for salvage operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170409000203|title=Sewol finally moved ashore|date=2017-04-09|author=Kim Da-sol|publisher=[[The Korea Herald]]|access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref>

== Administration ==
=== Mayor ===
Mokpo began its local government in 1994. In July 1995 it inaugurated its first mayor, Gwon I Dam, who had been the president of the Munhwa broadcasting corporation. The city's lack of supply in the past caused Gwon to focus on improving the city's water supplies. In 2000, the mayor officially provided aid for [[North Korea]] in the form of rice shipments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=102&oid=001&aid=0000125247 |script-title=ko:목포시, 밀가루 600t 북한 지원 |trans-title=Mokpo City to provide 600 tons of flour to North Korea|publisher=News Naver|date=12 January 2002|access-date=2022-08-28|language=ko}}</ref> However, Gwon came into conflict with the leaders of the [[Democratic Party (South Korea, 2005)|Democratic Party]] over fair election practices, causing him to leave the party. He filed a lawsuit against the Democratic Party, which the courts subsequently rejected.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=100&oid=047&aid=0000003308 |script-title=ko:민주당 목포시장 경선 ‘전태홍’씨 당선|trans-title=Democratic Party’s Mokpo Mayor, Jeon Tae-hong, was elected|author=Kim Yoo-seung |agency=OhMyNews |date=1 May 2002|access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref>

Another dispute arose in 2009, when non-governmental organizations based in Mokpo sued the government to disclose information about budgetary spending, which had been controlled by a city committee chosen by the mayor. The courts sided with the organizations, saying that the budget plan should be reported and monitored.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.cnbnews.com/category/read.html?bcode=65231 |script-title=ko:[전남] 법원, 목포시장 업무추진비 지출증빙자료 공개 판결|trans-title=[Jeonnam] Court decides to disclose evidence of Mokpo mayor's business promotion expenses|publisher=CNB News |date=11 January 2009 |access-date=7 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823050407/http://news.cnbnews.com/category/read.html?bcode=65231 |archive-date=23 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Disputes upon merge ===
In 2004, civil groups promoted merging the three adjacent communities: Sinan, Muan and Mokpo. On 25 September 2009, the city council of Mokpo officially submitted a plan to merge into one central government,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=100&oid=003&aid=0002949202 |script-title=ko:무안반도 통합 다섯번째 도전 '좌절'|trans-title=The fifth challenge of unification of the Muan Peninsula 'frustration'|date=2009-11-10|publisher=News Naver|access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://media.daum.net/press/view.html?cateid=1065&newsid=20090925170114630&p=yonhappr |script-title=ko:목포시, 행정안전부에 무안·신안·목포 자율통합 건의|trans-title=Mokpo City, Ministry of Public Administration and Security proposes autonomous integration of Muan, Shinan, and Mokpo|date=25 September 2009|newspaper=연합뉴스 보도자료 }}</ref> but the plan was voted down due to objections from the community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=102&oid=003&aid=0002949327 |script-title=ko:전남 무안반도.동부권 통합 무산…반대 우세|trans-title=Muan Peninsula, Jeollanam-do, and the eastern region failed to integrate… opposite dominance|date=2009-11-10|publisher=[[Newsis]]|access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref>

=== Population ===
In 2007, the population of Mokpo had increased to 90,000 households, with an average of 2.7 people per household. The population density was the 10th highest in South Korea, and it was the second fastest-growing region (after [[Gyeonggi-do|Gyeonggi province]]). In 2010, the [[Bank of Korea]] reported that the population of western South Jeolla province was declining due to several economic, social and educational issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=102&oid=003&aid=0003515633|script-title=ko:"전남 서남부지역 인구 감소 '지속'|trans-title=Decreased population in southwestern Jeollanam-do 'continues'|publisher=[[Yonhap News Agency]]|date=2 November 2010|access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref>

== Education ==
{{See also|Education in South Korea}}
One of the oldest elementary schools, Bukgyo, was established in 1897 for the aristocracy during the [[Joseon Dynasty]], following Order No. 145 of the [[Gojong of the Korean Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mokpobukkyo.es.jne.kr/user/indexSub.action?codyMenuSeq=161959&siteId=mokpobukkyo_es&menuUIType=sub|script-title=ko:학교연혁|trans-title=School history|publisher=Mokpobukkyo Elementary School|access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref> However, after its annexation by Japan, education in Mokpo was directed towards Japanese students.

Mokpo Commercial High School opened in 1920 as the first secondary-level school. Its name was later changed to Jeonnam Jeil High School. Former president Kim Dae Jung graduated from Jeil.

=== Universities ===
[[Mokpo National University]] (MNU) became a nationally supported school in 1976, after 30 years of existence. The school has become regionally famous for its shipbuilding research and other culturally related fields of study.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mokpo.ac.kr/index.9is |script-title=ko:국립목포대학교|website=www.mokpo.ac.kr|access-date=2022-08-28}}{{nonspecific|date=August 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=102&oid=003&aid=0000083168 |script-title=ko:목포대 누리사업 본격 출범|author=Seonggil Kang|trans-title=Full-scale launch of Mokpo University’s Nuri project|date=2004-09-08|publisher=[[Newsis]]|access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref> A 2007 study of national universities ranked MNU highly, equal with [[Seoul National University]] and [[Jeonnam National University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=102&oid=001&aid=0001967088 |script-title=ko:목포대 국립대 혁신 수준 평가서 '최우수'|trans-title=Mokpo National University Innovation Level Evaluation 'Best'|date=2008-02-20|publisher=News NAver|access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref> [[Mokpo National Maritime University]] is a government-funded school specializing in maritime-related studies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mmu.ac.kr/main|script-title=ko:국립목포해양대학교|website=Mopko National Maritime University}}{{nonspecific|date=August 2022}}</ref> [[Mokpo Catholic University]] was established in 1967 as Sungshin Nursing College, and later expanded its vocational training to include other fields.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcu.ac.kr/esub.php?section=intro&sub=2|title=History of Catholic University of Mokpo|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20070622163455/http://www.mcu.ac.kr/esub.php?section=intro&sub=2|archive-date=22 June 2007}}</ref>

== Economy ==
[[File: 20240225 View of Mokpo.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A view of the city (2024)]]
The harbor began operations earlier than other port cities on the Korean peninsula, allowing the city to experience growth, whereas growth in the country since its independence has concentrated on the [[Yeongnam]] area, where trade with Japan and Russia are viable due to the access of coastal routes. The addition of the [[Economy of China|Chinese economy]] into the local trade prospects increases the city's potential as a trade center via the [[Yellow Sea]].<ref>{{cite book|script-title=ko:한국, 과거를 딛고 미래를 보자|trans-title=Let's see the future over the past|author=Nam Deok-woo|publisher=[[Samsung Economic Research Institute]]|year=2007|page=369}}</ref>

=== Commerce ===
[[File:Mokpo station.JPG|left|thumb|250px|[[Mokpo station]]]]
Until late 1980s, commerce had been concentrated around the original downtown near [[Mokpo Station]]. In the late 1990s, large residential areas were built in Yeonsan dong and Hadang, resulting in a significant outflow of the population of the city. This resulted in the city council adopting a bylaw to support the old downtown area,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=001&oid=098&aid=0000102027& |script-title=ko:네이버 뉴스}}{{dead link|date=August 2022}}</ref> however, the outward flow has only worsened.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.asiae.co.kr/article/2009021814394289765|script-title=ko:원도심활성화, 또 하나의 신도시건설 |trans-title=Revitalization of the original city center, construction of another new city|website=asiae.co.kr |date=19 February 2009|access-date=2022-08-29}}</ref>

Economic power has been notably imbalanced by the opening of [[Lotte Mart]] in 2001 and [[E-Mart]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emart.shinsegae.com/branch/BRIntroduction01V.asp?JumID=E09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040630163325/http://emart.shinsegae.com/branch/BRIntroduction01V.asp?JumID=E09|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 June 2004|title=The profile of the E-mart at website}}</ref> [[Home plus]] is the solitary large-scale market in Mokpo, located in old downtown near the Munhwa broadcasting corporation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=001&aid=0001890613 |script-title=ko:삼성 홈플러스 목포점 17일 개점|trans-title=Samsung Homeplus Mokpo store opened on the 17th |agency=Newsis |date=11 January 2008|access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref>

The one exception to the declining economy of the city are the fish markets of Dongmyeong and North Harbor which have been a magnet for tourists and local people looking for octopus or other indigenous products. The economic bureau of the city has spent ₩300&nbsp;million on promoting the market since early 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=102&oid=001&aid=0002508116 |script-title=ko:목포시 재래시장상품권 인기몰이 ‘왜’?|trans-title=‘Why?’|agency=[[Yonhap]] |date=18 February 2009|access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref>

=== Companies ===
Companies with operations in Mokpo include the [[Bohae]] brewing company and Haengnam [[chinaware]]. Bohae Brewing Company produces a brand of [[soju]] from the Honam area, of which the best selling product is maple soju ({{lang|ko|잎새주}}), the first company to using maple in the brewing of soju. Bohae also entered into a joint development with [[Asahi Breweries]] in Japan to expand its soju production operations. In 2008, Bohae became the first Korean brewing company to open up wine sales in the United States, with the exportation of its [[Rugby Ball]] wine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.mk.co.kr/outside/view.php?year=2008&no=758689|script-title=ko:보해 복분자주, `럭비공 와인` 애칭으로 美서 호평|trans-title=Bohae bokbunja wine, popular in the United States with the nickname of 'rugby ball wine'|author=Bohae Brewing|date=2008-12-15|publisher=[[Maeil Business Newspaper]]|access-date=2022-08-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bohae.co.kr/theme/boh/html/history.php|script-title=ko:연혁|trans-title=History|publisher=Bohae Brewing|access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref>

Another major company is Haengnam chinaware, established in May 1942. Its headquarters is in Mokpo, with two other branches, one in Seoul for design and public relations, and another in [[Yeoju]] for production. In 1953, the company was the first in Korea to develop coffee cup sets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://haengnam.en.ec21.com/company_history.html|title=Company History|publisher=Haengnam Chinaware Inc.|access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref> In 1963, they began trade in Hong Kong, with exports to China growing to more than 2&nbsp;million dollars in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://economy.hankooki.com/lpage/industry/200810/e2008102816540347730.htm|script-title=ko:행남자기 "2009년 中수출 2배 확대"|trans-title=Haengman Ki "Doubling Exports to China in 2009"|author=Kim Heung-rok|date=2008-10-28|publisher=Hankooki|access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref> In 2011, its president signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Ministry of Environment of South Korea to develop a less pollutant-emitting process.

=== Farming and fishing ===
Mokpo is made up of sparsely populated farmland, with 1,326 households under a half hectare. The area produces high quantities of rice, barley, and beans, with greens and fruits such as tomatoes, cucumbers, and oriental melons increasing in popularity since 2001.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Ships from the harbor often travel to [[Heuksando]] to fish for skate and hairtail. Mokpo's yield of marine products reached 26,862 tons in 2006, consisting chiefly of fish, with of shellfish, mollusks, and seaweeds also contributing to the total. Mokpo is known for its harvest of small octopus, although this has declined in recent years. The number of fishermen had dropped to fewer than 3,000, but has been rising since 2007.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Industries ===
The regional economy relies heavily on the Daebul industrial complex and [[Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries]] located near [[Yeongam]]. The imports of merchandise support the local economy of Mokpo as they pass through its harbor. The Halla group was the initial owners of Heavy Industries, until they were taken over by Hyundai, which changed the company name to Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries, with Samho meaning three lakes. By 2007, corporate profits amounted to more than 460&nbsp;million, an increase of about 25% over those from 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.donga.com/3/all/20090117/8685438/1? |script-title=ko:대불단지의 中企“전봇대 뽑으면 희망있다”|trans-title=The middle story of the Daebul Complex “There is hope if you pull out the electric pole”|date=17 January 2009|author=Jo Eun-ah|website=[[The Dong-a Ilbo]]|access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Gang Seon won |trans-title=100 options for land dealers |script-title=ko: 《땅 투자자가 꼭 알아야 할 100가지》 |page=315}}</ref> South Jeolla province succeeded in attracting a series of investors for renewable energy companies like solar panels.

== Geography ==
[[File:Mokpo Marine Cable Car in South Korea 10.jpg|thumb|Cable car in [[Yudalsan]]]]
Mokpo sits at the southern end of the Muan peninsula, although the city lies within Sinan county, which mostly consists of 1004 islands. Its neighbor, Muan county, extends northeastward, separated from Mokpo by the Yeongsan river. [[Yudal mountain]] (228m) sits at the center of old downtown, and is a source of pride within the city. Its nickname is Gaegol ({{Korean|개골}}), meaning weird-shaped rocks and peaks. The side of the mountain caused roads around the downtown area to have a hilly aspect. Nojeokbong is a historic site where General Yi Soon Shin made use of its shape during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Japanese invasion]]. The city has small mountains nearby: Mt. Ibam (121m) to the east, and Yangeul (156m) and Daebak (156m) to the north.<ref>{{cite book|script-title=ko:대한민국 웬만한곳 다있다|trans-title=Everywhere in Korea|author1=Park Young|author2=Joo-Hwan Oh|publisher=Samsung Publishing House|year=2007|language=ko}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mokpo.go.kr/open_content/administrative/organization/location/ |script-title=ko:존재하지 않는 페이지 입니다.오류에 의한 페이지 자동 이동 |trans-title= Introduce the geographical features|publisher=City of Mokpo|access-date=4 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140830132213/http://www.mokpo.go.kr/ |archive-date=2014-08-30|language=ko}}</ref> The mouth of the Yeongsan River flows along the southern side of the city, containing 13 islands. The existence of a natural [[seawall]] created a natural safe harbor.

Most of the area of Mokpo consists of [[land reclamation]], including Samhakdo, North harbor ({{Korean|북항}}), and the new city of Hadang. According to the research by Mokpo National University, [[tributary|tributaries]] of the Yeongsan river crossed the central area of old downtown. This can be seen in the historic names of the Mokone Dong area: Namgyo-dong (southern side of bridge) and Bukgyo-dong (Northern side of bridge). Both names contained "gyo" ({{Korean|교|橋}}), meaning the bridge, indicating a bridge used to link the areas. Tideland reclamation projects removed large amounts of [[mud flat]]s, including Daebandong, Baekryundong and the coastal shore around Gatbawi. Additionally, the municipal boundaries include 7 [[desert island]]s.

The wall at the end of the Yeongsan river prevented damage from flooding during harsh typhoons. Meanwhile, the water quality of the river has worsened to the point where the ministry in charge of environmental protection began studying the impacts made by man-made structures. In 2010, the ministry's report recommended that the seawall should be widened and that the dirty water be pumped out of the riverbeds into the harbor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2010/05/03/0200000000AKR20100503073900054.HTML?did=1179m |script-title=ko:영산강 하구둑 개선사업 환경영향평가 '부실' |trans-title=Yeongsan River Estuary Embankment Improvement Project 'Poor' in Environmental Impact Assessment|publisher=[[Yonhap]] |date=23 May 2010 |access-date=4 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402001639/http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2010/05/03/0200000000AKR20100503073900054.HTML?did=1179m |archive-date=2 April 2012 |url-status=dead|language=ko}}</ref>

Mokpo's weather station was built along with five other sites in Korea, and began observing weather conditions on 25 March 1904.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Kim Dong Shik (김동식) |author2=Kim Jung Hyun (김정현) |publisher=Maeil Economy |year=2006 |script-title=ko:《날씨경영 하늘에서 돈이 옵니다》 |page=173}}</ref> Mokpo's climate features a short spring and autumn, and it is cold and dry in the winter and warm and humid with seasonal winds in the summer. There is also significant rain in the summer, averaging {{convert|1163|mm|in}}. Mokpo is usually windy and foggy in the spring and autumn due to its location near the ocean. Mokpo's long period (annual average of 223 days) without frost creates suitable conditions for rice farming. However, its seacoast location and the influence of the continental climate on the city often cause a great disparity between the rise and fall of daily and yearly temperatures. Mokpo, along with the rest of Sinan County, has the highest level of sunlight in Korea, enabling more efficient use of solar energy plants and related energy sources.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kbizweek.com/cp/view.asp?vol_no=601&art_no=29&sec_cd=1702 |script-title=ko:전국은 지금 ‘태양의 도시’ 열풍 |trans-title=The nation is now 'City of the Sun' craze|publisher=[[The Korea Economic Daily]] Business |date=11 June 2007|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-03-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331193936/http://magazine.hankyung.com/main.php?module=news&mode=sub_view&mkey=1&vol_no=601&art_no=29&sec_cd=1702|language=ko}}</ref> The frequency of [[yellow dust]] is quite similar to that of other cities like [[Seoul]] and [[Incheon]], occurring about 10–11 days per year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=102&oid=003&aid=0002537514 |script-title=ko:전남, 수도권비해 황사발생 적고 농도 낮다|trans-title=Jeollanam-do has fewer occurrences of yellow dust and lower concentration than the metropolitan area|author=Bae Sang-hyun |agency=[[Yonhap]] |date=21 February 2009|access-date=2022-08-28|language=ko}}</ref>

The climate of Mokpo is a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa''). Unexpected blizzards can sweep the region with strong gusts during winter, and the city experiences more than 30 days of snow, and 60 days below {{convert|0|°C|°F}}.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}} Mokpo sometimes falls within the range of passing typhoons, and may suffer peripheral damage, including heavy precipitation during the summer and early autumn. In 2004, [[2004 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Mindulle .28Igme.29|Typhoon Mindulle]] gave Mokpo a record rainfall of {{convert|64|mm|in}} per hour.

[[File:Korail Honam Line Mokpo Station.jpg|thumb|Mokpo Station]]
[[Mokpo station]] opened 15 May 1913, it is the final destination of [[Honam Line]] and accommodates over 1.2&nbsp;million annually, as well as cargo shipments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daos.net/railway/info.htm?code=180|title=Daos Railroad station|language=ko|publisher=Daos Korea|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030608233704/http://www.daos.net/railway/info.htm?code=180|archive-date=8 June 2003}}</ref>

The station is located near [[Yudalsan|Yudal Mountain]], in the southwestern part of the city. The railroad ends inside the station, although a freight-only line continued on to Samhakdo, carrying coal for the industrial factories. Because of potential danger, the city removed the rail extension in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/area/area_general/636643.html|script-title=ko:목포역~삼학도 철도 사라진다|trans-title=Mokpo Station-Samhakdo Railroad Disappears|author=Ahn Gwan-ok|publisher=Hani|date=2014-05-12|access-date=2022-08-28|language=ko}}</ref>

On 1 April 2004, [[Korea Train Express]] advertised a three-hour travel time from Seoul to Mokpo, however, the actual time was longer due to the number of stops along the Honam Line. Three-hour travel was only possible when limiting the train to four stops: [[Seodaejeon station|Seodaejeon]], [[Iksan station|Iksan]], [[Gwangju·Songjeong Station|Gwangjusongjeong]], and finally Mokpo. However, that service has not been available since 2008. Then, there were 10 trains from Yongsan station to Mokpo, with a travel time of 195 minutes.

Since 2015, there has been a high-speed [[KTX]] service linking Mokpo and [[Yongsan station|Yongsan Station]] within an average of 140 minutes. Limited services also allow passengers to travel further north to [[Seoul Station]] and [[Haengsin station]] in the city of [[Goyang]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

The [[Seohaean Expressway]] connects Mokpo to Seoul via a 4-hour car ride. The Muan-Gwangju Expressway was opened in 2008 to ease access to the Muan International Airport.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}} In 2012, the [[Namhae Expressway|Mokpo to Gwangyang Highway]] opened, connecting the eastern and western ends of [[South Jeolla]], as well as continuing on to [[Busan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mbn.mk.co.kr/pages/news/newsView.php?category=mbn00009&news_seq_no=1183147 |script-title=ko:목포~광양 간 고속도로 개통…주행시간 1시간 단축|trans-title=Expressway between Mokpo and Gwangyang opened...

[[South Korea National Route 1|National Route 1]] was planned to connect Mokpo to Sineuju in [[North Korea]]. After the [[Korean War]], however, the route was cut off at [[Imjingak]] near the truce village of [[Panmunjeom]]. It was not until 2000 when Route 1 was extended to North Korea's second largest city, [[Gaesung]].

=== Bus ===
Two companies provide most of the bus service in the local area. Since 2005, the companies and the city council agreed to expand the number of buses fueled by natural gas (NG), following a 3-year negotiation. The city agreed to assist the companies with a 21,000 US dollar per bus subsidy for each bus equipped with the NG equipment. As of 2006, 32 buses had been retrofitted with the natural gas equipment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=001&oid=098&aid=0000107329&|script-title=ko:천연가스(CNG) 시내버스 운행|date=29 January 2006|language=ko}}{{dead link|date=August 2022}}</ref> The growing suburbs around the city created a demand for additional lines, but there is conflict between the needs of the city and the profit margin of those new lines.

Riders may transfer between buses, free of charge, beginning on 1 March 2007. The lines are classified as inner circle, outer line and artery, which follows the commuting system of [[Seoul Buses]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20070302012009|script-title=ko:목포시 시내버스 무료환승 실시|trans-title=[Local] Mokpo city bus free transfer|date=2 March 2007|publisher=City of Seoul|access-date=2022-08-28|language=ko}}</ref> Buses with a low-floor level were first deployed in South Jeolla province in 2007, although they still remain in limited service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nodongilbo.com/news/articleViewAmp.html?idxno=26892|script-title=ko:목포시, 시내버스 저상버스 도입운행|trans-title=Mokpo City, city bus low-floor bus introduction operation|publisher=Rodong Ilbo|date=2007-11-02|access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref>

Since 2008, a semi-public bus system has been explored, with the intent of expanding the role of the city government in determining bus routes. The core goal is to share responsibility for operations as well as control over spending and income. However, [[Nongovernmental organization|NGOs]] have withheld support for the idea, resulting in the policy having not been implemented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailian.co.kr/news/n_view.html?id=128113&sc=naver&kind=menu_code&keys=25|script-title=ko:목포경실련, 시내버스 준공영제 “사회적 합의가 우선|trans-title=Woo Sang-ho and Lee Jae-myung go to the front...|language=ko|publisher=Dailian|date=1 October 2008|access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref>

=== Airport ===
[[Muan International Airport]] is the airport serving Mokpo. Previously, [[Mokpo Airport]] operated as the region's airport. The crash of [[Asiana Airlines Flight 733]] in 1993 increased concerns about the airport, resulting in extending the runway by 100 meters. However, the site still had fundamental drawbacks due to common foggy weather and the lack of related facilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/001/0001814230?sid=103 |title=<목포공항 38년만에 폐쇄..'역사의 뒤안길로'>|trans-title=<Mokpo Airport Closes After 38 Years..'Behind the Road of History'>|date=2007-11-09|publisher=Yonhap News|language=ko|access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref> [[Korean Air]] abolished the Gimpo-Mokpo route and [[Asiana Airlines]] started to slash services in 2004 with the removal of the Mokpo-Jeju route.

The alternative to Mokpo Airport was Muan International Airport, whose construction was delayed for many years, leading to disappointment among the local people. Eventually, however, the airport was constructed, and Mokpo Airport closed its doors in November 9, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yasinmoon.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=6293 |title=목포공항, ‘역사 뒤안길로’|trans-title=Mokpo Airport 'Now Behind History'|date=2007-11-20|publisher=Yeongam Sinmoon|language=ko|access-date=2024-10-13}}</ref>

=== Sea ===
[[File:Coastal area around Mokpo.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Frontal coast seen from Yudal Mountain]]
Mokpo has three harbors: one each for ferry service, trading and fishing. The main harbor is used to ferry customers and cargoes around nearby islands, while North harbor conducts ferry service to [[Nonghyup]]. Additionally, the newly built harbor is used for container shipping to China.

Over 80 sea-going lines have been available, notably for Heuksando, [[Hongdo]] and [[Jeju-do|Jeju]], as well as ferries linking Sinan county. In 2002, the first cruise-line to Shanghai was opened for operation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=102&oid=015&aid=0000569320|script-title=ko:목포~상하이 카페리 운항 .. 매주 2회 왕복|trans-title=Mokpo~Shanghai Car Ferry service .. 2 round trips per week|publisher=[[Korea Economy Daily]]|date=20 November 2002|access-date=2022-08-28|language=ko}}</ref> however, bankruptcy concerns forced the discontinuance of the cruise line after only five months. In July 2004, another attempt to start a cruise route to Shanghai, with a newly designed, smaller boat, failed due to Chinese objections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=001&aid=0000709862|script-title=ko:목포-상하이 뱃길 9월 재개|trans-title=Mokpo-Shanghai waterway resumes in September|language=ko|publisher=[[Yonhap News Agency]]|date=22 July 2004|access-date=2022-08-28|author=Jo Geun-young}}</ref>

The Mokpo coastal terminal was originally built during the 1980s, with the government beginning an update in 2003. The 30bn won, 4-story terminal opened in February 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=102&oid=015&aid=0000758743|script-title=ko:<지역경제시대> 올해를 빛낸 기업 : 목포여객터미널, 국제항만타운으로|trans-title=[Era of local economy] Companies that shined this year: Mokpo Passenger Terminal, International Port Town|language=ko|date=24 November 2004|publisher=News Naver|author=Choi Seong-guk|access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref> Mokpo coastal terminal is currently configured to divide coastal from international travel.

=== Festivals ===
A flower festival is held at Yudal mountain every April and May. The festival of [[Largehead Hairtail]] ({{Korean|hangul=목포사랑은빛갈치축제}}) takes place around Yeongsan Lake every October. The festival is extremely popular among fishing fans and family tourists. A fishing contest is held, wherein great numbers of people take part, which is followed by a fireworks display.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://star.moneytoday.co.kr/view/stview.php?no=2008092418594012342&type=1&outlink=1 |script-title=ko:목포바다 은빛갈치축제' 화려한 밤 수놓는다|trans-title='Mokpo Sea Silver Cutlass Festival' is embroidered on a splendid night|publisher=Starnews |date=24 September 2008|author=Kim Gun-woo|access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref>

The Nanyeong Singing Memorial celebrates the famous singer, [[Lee Nan-young]], whose song, "[[Tears of Mokpo]]" gained wide popularity. The memorial was started in 1968 by the Honam Maeil newspaper but was stopped, but was restarted by MBC Mokpo and is held every autumn.

=== City of Light ===
The city has a plan for promoting tourism in the old downtown, and South Jeolla province agreed to offer support for the city's plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=100&oid=001&aid=0000958888|script-title=ko:전남도, 구도심권 정비 본격 추진|trans-title=Provincial office agrees on backup for supporting old downtown in several areas|publisher=[[Yonhap News Agency]]|date=30 March 2005|author=Yeo Woon-chang|access-date=2022-08-28|language=ko}}</ref> This city's population decline has resulted in the closure of many shops, as well as a drastic reduction in the city's school system.

In the new downtown area, there is now a fountain, which times its waters and light show to the beat of the song. This was to be expanded, but has confronted opposition from several civil groups since 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/uhtml/read.jsp?idxno=2009022213371886336|script-title=ko:[新목포지리지]왜 평화광장 앞 바다인가?|trans-title=Why in front of the peace plaza|date=23 February 2009|publisher=Asia Economics|access-date=2022-08-28|language=ko}}</ref>

=== Islands offshore ===
Outside of the harbor, thousands of islands dot the [[Yellow Sea]], several of which are actually part of Mokpo. The government has promoted a program of constructing infrastructure on each island. With the slogan of "Lovely island, Uai-dal", [[Hanok]] residences on these islands, each with a saltwater pool, have served as accommodations for tourists during the summer.

One of the most famous islands, Goha-do, was used as a base for naval forces in the late 16th century when Japan invaded Joseon. The Japanese navy created artificial caves on this island to conceal armaments from the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] during the Second World War. Two air-raid shelters have been found. The Mokpo Bridge was publicly opened in June 2012.

=== Museums ===
Many museums in Mokpo are located near Gatbawi street, due to the city concentrating its investment to exhibition space in this area. The National Maritime museum is one of the oldest museums dedicated to the Korean naval and shipping traditions. The museum changed its name in 2009 to the Research Institute for Maritime History, due to its broadened function.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=103&oid=003&aid=0002646652 |script-title=ko:해양유물전시관, '문화재연구소'로 명칭 변경 |trans-title=Changed the name of the Marine Relics Exhibition Hall to the 'Cultural Heritage Research Center'|author=Park Sang-soo|agency=Newsis |date=28 April 2009|language=ko}}</ref> The Institute conducts surveys and research related to ancient ships, trade routes and relics, and is the only research institute for maritime relics in [[South Korea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hankyung.com/news/app/newsview.php?aid=2007012515711|script-title=ko:목포 외달도 … 남도음식ㆍ갯벌체험ㆍ삼림욕, 청량감을 먹고 마셔요|trans-title=Mokpo Oedal Island … Namdo food, tidal flat experience, forest bathing, eating and drinking refreshing persimmons|date=2007-01-29|publisher=[[The Korea Economic Daily]]|access-date=2022-08-28|language=ko}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=National Research Institute of Maritime Cultural Heritage|url=http://www.seamuse.go.kr/_publish/e-book/english/VIEW.HTM|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724185334/http://www.seamuse.go.kr/_publish/e-book/english/VIEW.HTM |archive-date=24 July 2011 |language=ko}}</ref>

The Mokpo Natural History Museum has a large collection of fossils from all over the world. It originally began as a single building, but has expanded into a second building, the Cultural Heritage Hall, which specializes in local relics dating as far back as prehistoric time. The museum has an extensive collection of samples and data regarding everything from dinosaur fossils to insects and [[cetacean]]s found in the Yellow Sea. One of the most significant displays is a nest of dinosaur eggs, found on Aphae island, which was restored and opened to the public in 2010. The eggs reach lengths greater than 40&nbsp;cm, and have been dated to approximately 80&nbsp;million years ago, during the [[Mesozoic]] period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0103_201012040856383040 |script-title=ko:8,000만 년 전 공룡알 둥지 화석 공개|trans-title=[Jeonnam] Fossils of 80 million-year-old dinosaur egg nests revealed|website=[[YTN]] |date=4 December 2010|access-date=2022-08-28|language=ko}}</ref> The [[Korea Forest Service]] chose the museum to record its samples of insects in a national database for biological resources in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=102&oid=003&aid=0002855489 |script-title=ko:목포자연사박물관 소장 곤충표본 DB 구축 |trans-title="Building a database of insect specimens in the Mokpo Natural History Museum"|author=Park Sang-soo|agency=Newsis |date=9 September 2009|access-date=2022-08-28|language=ko}}</ref>

Namnong Memorial Hall commemorates the famed [[Korean calligraphy|calligrapher]], Heo Gun. The Hall is situated within a [[Korean garden|Korean traditional garden]] and features exhibitions on different series of his works.

The Mokpo Ceramic Museum opened in 2008, was funded by the government to establish ceramics and china exhibits from notable manufacturers. Meanwhile, the Literature hall of Mokpo ({{Korean|hangul=목포문학관}}) is not far from the ceramic museum, and hosts literature classes for the general public, featuring specific writers or novels, to promote literature among the local population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=102&oid=001&aid=0003379248 |script-title=ko:목포문학관, 찾아가는 문학교실 '인기' |trans-title=Mokpo Literary Museum, Visiting Literature Class 'Popular'|author=Jo Geun-young|agency=[[Yonhap]] |date=14 July 2010|access-date=2022-08-28|language=ko}}</ref>

===Cuisine===
<!-------Mokpo is famous for strong smelling fermented fish [[Hongeo]] (in Hangul : 홍어) and many kinds of side dishes [[banchan]]. ----->
Being located close to the sea, the city's cuisine is characterized by [[seafood]] dishes. Mokpo is famous for [[hongeo-hoe]] ({{Korean|hangul = 홍어회}}), a strong smelling fermented dish featuring the [[Skate (fish)|skate]], a kind of [[ray fish]].
Other delicacies of Mokpo are: kimchi and [[pyeonyuk]] ({{Korean|hangul = 홍어삼합}}); a variant of [[yeonpo-tang]] containing [[Octopus minor|long arm octopus]]; [[Hoe (dish)|hoe]]; and seasoned ''[[Portunus trituberculatus]]''. The city started a public market for vendors selling their own delicacies, located downtown.

=== Facilities for sports and cultural entertainment ===
Yudal Stadium is located next to the 100 Year Memorial Avenue. The stadium consists of ballpark and an eight lane track. Behind the stadium, local groups are able to use public tennis courts. The ground floor of the stadium houses committees of diverse sports.

The city has attracted many athletes to train in the area during the winter, due to sunny and warm weather, and numerous accommodations. The city has been very successful in reaching agreements with 127 teams, totaling almost 6,000 athletes, who trained during the winter in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=102&oid=038&aid=0000258574 |trans-title=Come to Mokpo for winter training |author=Park Kyung-woo|language=ko|script-title=ko:스포츠 동계훈련 목포로 오세요 |date=23 November 2004 |agency=Hankook Ilbo|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-17|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120717193042/http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=102&oid=038&aid=0000258574}}</ref> Since 2005, the focus has been on track and field sports to boost the number of visiting athletes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=001&oid=098&aid=0000108469&|title=2006 National athletic contest in Mokpo|date=3 February 2006|publisher=News Naver|access-date=2022-08-28|language=ko}}{{dead link|date=August 2022}}</ref>

Recreational parks are located sparsely around Yudal mountain, while the city is in the process of constructing an additional park in the Samhakdo area.

The [[Mokpo Cultural Complex]] is located along the shore near [[Gatbawi (Mokpo)|Gatbawi]], consisting of two buildings, one for performance and the other for exhibition.
