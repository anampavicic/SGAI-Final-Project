'''Depok''' ([[Sundanese language|Sundanese]]: ᮓᮨᮕᮧᮊ᮪) is a landlocked [[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|city]] in [[West Java]] province. It is located directly south of [[Jakarta]], it is the third largest urban centre in the [[Jabodetabek|Greater Jakarta]] metropolitan area after Jakarta and [[Bekasi]] and it has an area of 199.91&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. It had a population of 1,738,600 at the 2010 census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 2,056,400 at the 2020 census;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 2,145,400 (comprising 1,080,541 males and 1,064,859 females), resulting in a density of 10,731.8 people per km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Depok Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.3276)</ref> Depok was created as a separate city on 20 April 1999, having previously been part of [[Bogor Regency]]. It constitutes the second most populous suburban city in Indonesia (after [[Bekasi]]), and the [[List of satellite cities by population|tenth most populous suburban city globally]].

== History ==
There are two possible origins of the name 'Depok'. The first is that it the region was already known as Depok when the land was bought by [[Cornelis Chastelein]], a senior official in the [[Dutch East India Company]] in 1696 and that on 18 May 1696, a former [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] officer [[Cornelis Chastelein]] bought land with an area of 12.44&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, 6.2% the area of today's Depok. Besides cultivating the area with industrial plants with the help of the locals, Chastelein was active as a missionary, preaching [[Christianity]] to the indigenous Indonesians. To this end, he established a local congregation named ''De Eerste Protestante Organisatie van Christenen (DEPOC)''. In the 1950s, the claim that this acronym led to the modern name for Depok emerged among the community of people from Depok living in the Netherlands.<ref name="The Forgotten Bule Depok">{{cite web|url=http://www.goodnewsfromindonesia.org/2014/09/22/forgotten-bule-depok/|title=The Forgotten Bule Depok – Good News from Indonesia|first=Tasa Nugraza|last=Barley|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502075127/http://www.goodnewsfromindonesia.org/2014/09/22/forgotten-bule-depok/|archive-date=2016-05-02|access-date=2016-10-18}}</ref> An alternative explanation for the name is that it comes from the Indonesian word ''padepokan'', meaning 'shrine', as the location had been used as a religious retreat before Chastelein's purchase of the land.<ref>{{cite web|author = Wahyu Adityo Prodjo| url= https://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2021/04/27/06000041/berbagai-cerita-asal-usul-nama-depok-dari-padepokan-hingga-akronim?page=all| title=Berbagai Cerita Asal-usul Nama Depok, dari Padepokan hingga Akronim Komunitas Belanda-Depok | language = id | trans-title = Stories about the Origin of the Nema Depok, from Shrine to an Acronym from the Dutch-Depok Community |date = 27 April 2021 |access-date=4 June 2023}}</ref>

Before his death on 28 June 1714, Chastelein had written a will that freed the slave families of Depok and gave them pieces of his land, converting [[slaves]] into [[landlord]]s.
In 1714, the 12 slave families became landlords (forever as given to them with entitlement deeds of the owner Chastelien in his will) and freed men, women, and children.
The freed slaves are also referred to as the [[Mardijker people|Mardijker's]] – the word Merdeka meaning freedom in Bahasa Indonesia. June 28 is designated as Depokse Daag (Depok Day) by the original Depok family, and on 28 June 2014, commemorating 300 years, they formally opened a 3-meter height monument on its own land, but it was prohibited by the Government as it referred to Dutch colonialization.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tribunnews.com/metropolitan/2014/09/06/tugu-chastelein-dilarang-berdiri-di-depok |title=Tugu Chastelein Dilarang Berdiri di Depok |first=Rachmat |last=Hidayat |date=September 6, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908064602/http://www.tribunnews.com/metropolitan/2014/09/06/tugu-chastelein-dilarang-berdiri-di-depok |archive-date=September 8, 2014 }}</ref>

The original slave families of Depok are of [[Balinese people|Balinese]], [[Ambonese]], [[Buginese people|Buginese]], [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] and [[Indos in pre-colonial history|Portuguese Indo]], i.e., Mestizo and [[Mardijker people|Mardijker]] descent. Isakh, Jacob, Jonathans, Joseph, and Samuel were family names baptized by Chastelein after the slave families converted to [[Protestant Christianity]]. The other families retained their original names and might have been (Roman Catholic) Christian already before joining Chastelein's Protestant church. Descendants of the original Depok families with the exception of the Sadokh family, still live in Indonesia, the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.depok.nl/depok/hoofdstuk/geschiedenis/|title=Depok|website=www.depok.nl|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724151712/http://www.depok.nl/depok/hoofdstuk/geschiedenis/|archive-date=2011-07-24}}</ref><ref name="Jakarta Globe article"/>

In 1871, the colonial government gave Depok a special status allowing the area to form its own government and president. The ruling no longer stood after 1952, where the Depok presidency ceded its control of Depok to the Indonesian government except for a few areas.

During the [[Bersiap]] (Indonesian civil war and war for independence from The Netherlands) period of 1945 much of Depok was destroyed and many of its inhabitants killed by 'Pemuda'.<ref>Meijer, Hans. ‘In Indie geworteld, de Geschiedenis van Indische Nederlanders, de twintigste eeuw.’ (Publisher Bert Bakker, Amsterdam, 2004) P.245 {{ISBN|90-351-2617-3}}</ref> Many of the original Depok families fled for their lives from Indonesia during the Indonesian revolution and now live in the Netherlands as part of the [[Indo people|Indo]] community there.<ref>{{in lang|nl}} [http://www.depok.nl/ Dutch Depok community Website.

In March 1982, Depok was reclassified as an administrative city within [[Bogor Regency]] and, in 1999, as a city headed by a mayor. Then on 20 April 1999, the city of Depok was unified with some neighbouring districts of Bogor Regency to form an autonomous city of Depok (independent of the Regency) with an area of 199.91&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.depok.go.id|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011225024/http://www.depok.go.id/|url-status=dead|title=depok.go.id|archivedate=October 11, 2006}}</ref> This date is commemorated as the date of the establishment of the city.

The ethnic groups characteristics in the population of Depok are diverse. Based on data from the [[2000 Indonesian census]], the majority of the Depok population's are [[Betawi people|Betawi]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], and [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]]. Significant numbers also come from the Sumatran ethnic groups, namely [[Batak peoples|Batak]] and [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]]. The diversity of ethnic groups in Depok greatly influences the differences in culture and customs of the peoples, where the Betawi people of native Depok and a small number of Sundanese people (not including other ethnic Sundanese immigrants from [[Parahyangan]] and [[Banten]]) in the eastern part of the city are recognized as the indigenous people of Depok.
