'''Concepcion''', officially the '''Municipality of Concepcion''' ({{lang-pam|Balen ning Concepcion}}; {{lang-fil|Bayan ng Concepcion}}), is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Tarlac]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 169,953 people.{{PH census|current}}

== History ==
In 1860, the towns of Concepcion and Magalang comprised a single town named San Bartolome (presently a barangay of Concepcion), which was a military ''Commandancia'' of Pampanga under the Spanish regime.

A catastrophic flood devastated the whole settlement of San Bartolome in 1863 and its residents were left with no other choice but to abandon the place. Divided as to where they were to resettle, some went north and others went south.

The first group, headed by Don Pablo Luciano, the Governadorcillo, organized a new settlement on the slopes of Mt. Arayat further south and named the settlement after him. Eventually, the place was renamed Magalang.

The second group who took refuge in the north comprised the ''Santoses'', ''Laxamanas'', ''Salvadors'',  ''Yumuls'', ''Castros'', ''Dizons'', ''Pinedas'', ''Felicianos'', ''Aquinos'', ''Corteses'', ''Bermudezes'', ''Perezes'', ''Punsalangs'' and many others, and settled in a place (now called Santo Nino) then occupied by the ''Lindos'' and ''the Amuraos (Don Esquolastiquo Amurao and Don Gaston Amurao)''.

Most of the settlers became dissatisfied with the place, as it abounded with snakes and was scarce in water. They moved further south to a place now known as Concepcion. The settlers began clearing the land and built huts and roads. After several years, they named the place Concepcion after the [[Immaculate Conception]], who was believed to possess power over the snakes that abound in the area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.concepciontarlac.com/html/history.htm |title=History of Concepcion |accessdate=2009-01-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106003305/http://www.concepciontarlac.com/html/history.htm |archivedate=2009-01-06 }}</ref>

== Geography ==
Concepcion is one of the largest municipalities of the province of [[Tarlac]]. It lies on the south-eastern tip of Tarlac, bordered in the south by [[Magalang, Pampanga]], in the east by [[San Antonio, Nueva Ecija]], in the north-east by [[La Paz, Tarlac|La Paz]], in the north-west by [[Tarlac City]], in the west by [[Capas, Tarlac|Capas]], and in the south-west by [[Bamban, Tarlac|Bamban]]. It covers an area of {{convert|245.7|km2}}.

It has two great rivers, the first being Lucong River which originates from Dingding and Namria creeks in [[Capas, Tarlac]]; it is visible from the bridge at Barangay Santiago, and merges with the Rio Chico before joining the [[Pampanga River]]. The second is Parua River, which originates from the Sacobia-Bamban river that comes from [[Mount Pinatubo]]. Parua River is heavily silted with 7 meters of sand deposits; its bridge was destroyed by [[lahar]] and is visible at Barangay San Nicolas Balas. It also merges with the Rio Chico before joining [[Pampanga River]]. Both rivers are utilized to irrigate the town's agricultural lands, consisting mainly of rice and sugar crops. Parua River, which at times appears as a bed of sand due to the scarcity of water, is also a quarry site for sand and ash used as construction material.

=== Barangays ===
Concepcion is politically subdivided into 45 [[barangay]]s. Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].
