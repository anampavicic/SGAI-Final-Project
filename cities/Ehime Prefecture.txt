{{Nihongo|'''Ehime Prefecture'''|愛媛県|Ehime-ken}} is a [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] of [[Japan]] located on the island of [[Shikoku]].<ref>Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Ehime" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 170|page=170}}.</ref> Ehime Prefecture has a population of 1,334,841<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/japan/ehime/ |title= Ehime Population}}</ref> and has a geographic area of 5,676 [[Square kilometre|km<sup>2</sup>]] (2,191 [[sq mi]]). Ehime Prefecture borders [[Kagawa Prefecture]] to the northeast, [[Tokushima Prefecture]] to the east, and [[Kōchi Prefecture]] to the southeast.

[[Matsuyama]] is the capital and largest city of Ehime Prefecture and the largest city on Shikoku, with other major cities including [[Imabari, Ehime|Imabari]], [[Niihama]], and [[Saijō, Ehime|Saijō]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Matsuyama" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 621|page=621}}.</ref>

==History==
{{See also|Historic Sites of Ehime Prefecture}}

Until the [[Meiji Restoration]], Ehime Prefecture was known as [[Iyo Province]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 780|page=780}}.</ref> Since before the [[Heian period]], the area was dominated by fishermen and sailors who played an important role in defending Japan against pirates and [[Mongols|Mongolian]] invasions.

After the [[Battle of Sekigahara]], the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] ''[[shōgun]]'' gave the area to his allies, including [[Katō Yoshiaki]] who built [[Matsuyama Castle (Iyo)|Matsuyama Castle]], forming the basis for the modern city of [[Matsuyama]].

The name Ehime comes from the ''[[kuniumi]]'' part of the ''[[Kojiki]]'' where Iyo Province is mythologically named Ehime, "lovely princess".<ref>Chamberlain, Basil Hall. 1882. ''A translation of the "Ko-ji-ki" or Records of ancient matters''. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/shi/kj/kj012.htm section V]</ref>

In 2012, a research group from the University of Tokyo and Ehime University said they had discovered rare earth deposits in Matsuyama.<ref>{{cite web|title=Japan Discovers Domestic Rare Earths Reserve|url=http://www.brightwire.com/news/207869-japan-discovers-domestic-rare-earths-reserve|publisher=BrightWire|access-date=2012-05-10|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120723024000/http://www.brightwire.com/news/207869-japan-discovers-domestic-rare-earths-reserve|archive-date=2012-07-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Geography==
Located in the northwestern part of Shikoku, Ehime faces the [[Seto Inland Sea]] to the north and is bordered by [[Kagawa prefecture|Kagawa]] and [[Tokushima prefecture|Tokushima]] in the east and [[Kōchi Prefecture|Kōchi]] in the south.

The prefecture includes both high mountains in the inland region and a long coastline, with many islands in the [[Seto Inland Sea]].  The westernmost arm of Ehime, the [[Sadamisaki Peninsula]], is the narrowest peninsula in Japan.

As of 31 March 2020, 7 percent of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as [[Prefectural Natural Park|Natural Parks]], namely the [[Ashizuri-Uwakai National Park|Ashizuri-Uwakai]] and [[Setonaikai National Park|Setonaikai]] National Parks; [[Ishizuchi Quasi-National Park]]; and [[Hijikawa Prefectural Natural Park|Hijikawa]], [[Kinshako Prefectural Natural Park|Kinshako]], [[Okudōgo Tamagawa Prefectural Natural Park|Okudōgo Tamagawa]], [[Sadamisaki Hantō-Uwakai Prefectural Natural Park|Sadamisaki Hantō-Uwakai]], [[Saragamine Renpō Prefectural Natural Park|Saragamine Renpō]], [[Sasayama Prefectural Natural Park|Sasayama]], and [[Shikoku Karst Prefectural Natural Park (Ehime)|Shikoku Karst]] Prefectural Natural Parks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.env.go.jp/park/doc/data/natural/naturalpark_4.pdf |script-title=ja:自然公園都道府県別面積総括 |trans-title=General overview of area figures for Natural Parks by prefecture |language=ja |publisher=[[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] |date=31 March 2020 |access-date=23 September 2020}}</ref>
