== Etymology ==
The name of the city is a combination of words Peter ([[Peter the Great]]) and ''zavod'' (meaning factory).

It was previously known as ''Shuysky Zavod'' (1703–1704) and ''Petrovskaya Sloboda'' (1704–1777), which was the first name of the city related to Peter the Great. It was renamed to Petrozavodsk after [[Catherine the Great]] granted the settlement the status of a city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Petrozavodsk city, Russia |url=https://russiatrek.org/petrozavodsk-city |access-date=13 September 2022 |website=RussiaTrek}}</ref>

An ancient Swedish name was ''Onegaborg'', known from a map from 1592 of the Flemish [[cartographer]] [[Abraham Ortelius]], and hence translated to Finnish as ''Äänislinna'', a name used during the [[Finnish military administration in Eastern Karelia|occupation of Eastern Karelia by Finnish forces]] during the [[Continuation War]] (1941–1944) in the context of [[World War II]].

==History==
[[File:Petrozavodskchurch.jpg|thumb|left|A church in Petrozavodsk, as photographed ca. 1912 by [[Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky]]]]
Archeological discoveries in the urban area indicate the presence of a settlement as far back as seven thousand years ago, and during the [[Middle Ages]] the site of modern city was marked by several [[Lake Onega|lakeside]] villages.  Within the city limits, the district of Solomennoje appears in surviving records dating back to the sixteenth century, and a map produced by the [[Low Countries|Flemish]] [[cartographer]] [[Abraham Ortelius]] at the end of that century places a settlement here called Onegaborg on the site of modern Petrozavodsk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enc_geo/3842/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%81%D0%BA|title=Петрозаводск - это... Что такое Петрозаводск?|website=Словари и энциклопедии на Академике|accessdate=May 18, 2021}}</ref>

On 11 September 1703, [[Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov|Prince Menshikov]] founded the settlement of Petrovskaya Sloboda ("Petrine [[Sloboda (settlement)|Sloboda]]"). He did so at the behest of Tsar [[Peter the Great]], who needed a new iron foundry to manufacture cannons and anchors for the [[Baltic Fleet]] at the time of the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721). At first the foundry used the name ''Shuysky zavod'' (literally, "[[factory]] at the [[Shuya River, Karelia|Shuya River]]"), but a decade later it became ''Petrovsky zavod'' ("Petrine factory"), after the name of the reigning monarch.<ref name="GeoEntsy"/> From this form the present name of the city derives.

By 1717, Petrovskaya Sloboda had grown into the largest settlement in [[Karelia]], with about 3,500 inhabitants, a timber fort, a [[Gostiny Dvor|covered market]], and miniature palaces of the Tsar and Menshikov. The town's best-known landmark became the wooden church of [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]], which was rebuilt in 1772 and renovated in 1789. The church retained its original [[iconostasis]] until this relic of the Tsar [[Peter the Great]]'s reign was destroyed by fire on October&nbsp;30, 1924.

After Peter's death, Petrovskaya Sloboda became depopulated and the factory declined. It closed down in 1734, although foreign industrialists maintained copper factories in the vicinity.

The industry revived in 1773 when [[Catherine the Great]] established a new iron foundry upstream the Lososinka River. Designed to provide cannons for the ongoing [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)|Russo-Turkish Wars]], the foundry was named Alexandrovsky, after [[Alexander Nevsky]], who was considered a patron saint of the region. The factory was modernized and expanded under supervision of [[Charles Gascoigne]] in 1787–96. Local pundits claim that the first [[railway]] in the world (чугунный колесопровод) was inaugurated for industrial uses of the Alexandrovsky foundry in 1788.
[[File:Petrozavodsk 06-2017 img53 Lenin Square.jpg|thumb|Round Square in central Petrozavodsk]]

During Catherine's municipal reform of 1777, Petrovskaya Sloboda was incorporated as a town, whereupon its name was changed to Petrozavodsk. A new [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] city center was then built, focused on the newly planned Round Square. In 1784 Petrozavodsk was large enough to supplant [[Olonets]] as the administrative center of the region. Although [[Emperor Paul]] abolished [[Olonets Governorate]], it was revived as a separate [[guberniya]] in 1801, with Petrozavodsk as its administrative center.

During the [[Finnish military administration in Eastern Karelia|Finnish occupation]] in the [[Continuation war ]] (1941–1944), the city was styled as ''Äänislinna'' (or ''Ääneslinna''), rather than the traditional ''Petroskoi''. This name was a literal translation of ''Onegaborg'', the name of a settlement marked on a 16th-century map by [[Abraham Ortelius]] near the present-day city, ''Ääninen'' being the Finnish toponym for Lake Onega. On 14 October 1941, occupation authorities opened the first [[East Karelian concentration camps|concentration camp]]. By the liberation of Petrozavodsk there were 11 concentration camps.<ref>Веригин С. Г.

==Landmarks==
[[File:Petrozavodsk 06-2017 img34 University.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Petrozavodsk State University]]]]
Petrozavodsk is distinguished among other towns of North Russia by its [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] architectural heritage, which includes the Round Square (1775, reconstructed in 1789 and 1839) and the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral (consecrated in 1832). Among the town's landmarks are the outdoor statues of Peter I (bronze and granite, [[Ippolit Monighetti]], 1873), [[Gavrila Derzhavin]] (a Russian poet who was the governor of Olonets in the 18th century), and [[Alexander Nevsky]] (erected outside Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in 2010).

The city has a fine frontage on the Gulf of Petrozavodsk. The modern embankment, inaugurated in 1994, displays an assortment of Karelian granites and marbles. It is lined with extravagant postmodernist sculptures presented by sister cities of Petrozavodsk from around the world. There is also a birch copse, where the first church of Petrozavodsk was built in 1703.

Petrozavodsk is home to the Karelia Philharmonic Orchestra (1933), the Karelian Musical Theater (1955, statuary by [[Sergey Konenkov]]), National Library of Karelia (1959), Finnish-speaking [[National Theatre of Karelia]] (1965), [[Petrozavodsk State University]], a [[Petrozavodsk State Glazunov Conservatoire|conservatory]], a city museum founded in 1871, and a branch of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].

One of the city's central landmarks is Lenin Square, an oval space with a large Soviet-era statue of Lenin in the center. The square is especially notable for English-speaking visitors because it is also called "round square" - an oxymoron in English, but not in Russian (''kruglaya ploshad'').

==Suburbs==
[[File:Petrozavodsk 06-2017 img26 aerial view.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Petrozavodsk]]
The village of Shoksha near Petrozavodsk contains a quarry of red and pink quartzite ([[Shoksha quartzite]]) which was used in construction of [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] and [[Lenin Mausoleum]], among many other notable structures. There are also other quarries in the region excavating road aggregates (Goloday Gora – gabbro-diabase) near Derevyanka.

The suburb of Martsialnye Vody is the oldest [[destination spa|spa]] in [[Russia]], founded by [[Peter the Great]] in 1714 and visited by the Tsar on four occasions. Its name means "The Waters of Mars" in Russian. Although Peter's palace at Martsialnye Vody has not survived, there is a museum devoted to the spa's history.

From Petrozavodsk Harbor, a [[hydrofoil]] service of "KareliaFlot" company carries people to the island of [[Kizhi]], a [[World Heritage Site]] with an outdoor museum of ancient wooden architecture.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Petrozavodsk experiences a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfb'') bordering on a [[subarctic climate]] (''Dfc'') and unlike other localities in Russia on its latitude, temperatures are relatively mild for the latitude. This is due to the influence of the milder oceanic and maritime air masses reaching the city from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Baltic Sea]], especially in winter and the moderating effect of the nearby lakes. The alternation of milder and colder air masses causes rapid changes in temperatures, especially during the cool half of the year.  Winters, though long and cold, are mild for the high latitude, while summers are short and warm. The city experiences an average of 161 frost days  per year, which is still less than places further east at the same latitude. The lake influence is stronger in summer, where Petrozavodsk has quite low [[diurnal temperature variation]] with mild nights for its latitude. Summer is moderately warm, autumn starts with clear but usually cool weather in the first half of September. Precipitation averages {{convert|611|mm|2|disp=or}} annually.
