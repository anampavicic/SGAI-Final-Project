'''California''' is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Western United States]], lying on the American [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]]. It borders [[Oregon]] to the north, [[Nevada]] and [[Arizona]] to the east, and [[Mexico–United States border|an international border]] with the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Baja California]] to the south. With nearly 39{{spaces}}million residents across an area of {{convert|163696|sqmi|km2}},<ref name="2022 World Population by Country">{{cite web | title=United States by Area | website=2022 World Population by Country | url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/states-by-area | access-date=December 17, 2022}}</ref> it is the [[List of states and territories of the United States by population|most populous]] U.S. state, the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|third-largest]] by area, and most populated [[Administrative division|subnational entity]] in [[North America]].

Prior to [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]], California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in [[pre-Columbian North America]]. European exploration in the 16th and 17th centuries led to the colonization by the [[Spanish Empire]]. The area became a part of Mexico in 1821, following its successful [[Mexican War of Independence|war for independence]], but [[Mexican Cession|was ceded to the United States]] in 1848 after the [[Mexican–American War]]. The [[California gold rush]] started in 1848 and led to social and demographic changes, including depopulation of Indigenous peoples in the [[California genocide]]. The western portion of Alta California was then organized and [[California Statehood Act|admitted as the 31st state in 1850]], as a [[Slave states and free states|free state]], following the [[Compromise of 1850]].

==Etymology==
{{Main|Etymology of California|Island of California}}
[[File:Detail of Queen Califia in the "California's Name" mural (Lucile Lloyd, 1937) (cropped).gif|thumb|left|upright|The word "California" and its namesake ruler, [[Calafia|Queen Calafia]], originate in the 1510 epic ''[[Las Sergas de Esplandián]]'', written by [[Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo]].]]

The Spaniards gave the name {{lang|es|Las Californias}} to the [[Baja California peninsula|peninsula of Baja California]] (in modern-day Mexico). As Spanish explorers and settlers moved north and inland, the region known as ''California'', or ''Las Californias'', grew. Eventually it included lands north of the peninsula, [[Alta California]], part of which became the present-day U.S. state of California.

A 2017 state legislative document states, "Numerous theories exist as to the origin and meaning of the word 'California,{{'"}} and that all anyone knows is the name was added to a map by 1541 "presumably by a Spanish navigator."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/16/us/why-is-california-called-california.html|title=Why Is California Called California?|last=Karlamangla|first= Soumya|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 16, 2024|access-date=April 17, 2024}}</ref>

The name most likely derived from the mythical island of California in the fictional story of [[Calafia|Queen Calafia]], as recorded in a 1510 work ''[[Las sergas de Esplandián|The Adventures of Esplandián]]'' by [[Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo]].<ref name="Gudde-2010">{{Cite book |last1=Gudde |first1=Erwin G. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ibMwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR9 |title=California Place Names: The Origin and Etymology of Current Geographical Names |last2=Bright |first2=William |date=2010 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26619-3 |pages=59–60 |orig-date=2004}}</ref> Queen Calafia's kingdom was said to be a remote land rich in gold and pearls, inhabited by beautiful Black women who wore gold armor and lived like [[Amazons]], as well as [[griffin]]s and other strange beasts.<ref name="Gudde-2010" /><ref>{{Cite book |last=Putnam |first=Ruth |title=California: The name |date=1917 |publisher=University of California |editor-last=Priestley |editor-first=Herbert Ingram |location=Berkeley |pages=356–361 |chapter=Appendix A: Etymology of the Word 'California': Surmises and Usage |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924008278347}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Vogeley |first=Nancy |date=April 20, 2001 |title=How Chivalry Formed the Myth of California |journal=Modern Language Quarterly |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=165–188 |doi=10.1215/00267929-62-2-165 |s2cid=163100071 |issn = 0026-7929}}</ref>

The [[Portolá expedition]] of 1769–70 was a pivotal event in the Spanish colonization of California, resulting in the establishment of numerous missions, [[presidio]]s, and [[pueblos]]. The military and civil contingent of the expedition was led by [[Gaspar de Portolá]], who traveled over land from [[Sonora]] into California, while the religious component was headed by [[Junípero Serra]], who came by sea from [[Baja California]]. In 1769, Portolá and Serra established [[Mission San Diego de Alcalá]] and the [[Presidio of San Diego]], the first religious and military settlements founded by the Spanish in California. By the end of the expedition in 1770, they would establish the [[Presidio of Monterey]] and [[Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo]] on Monterey Bay.

After the Portolà expedition, Spanish [[missionary|missionaries]] led by Father-President Serra set out to establish 21 [[Spanish missions of California]] along [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] ("The Royal Road") and along the California coast, 16 sites of which having been chosen during the Portolá expedition. Numerous major cities in California grew out of missions, including San Francisco ([[Mission San Francisco de Asís]]), San Diego ([[Mission San Diego de Alcalá]]), Ventura ([[Mission San Buenaventura]]), or Santa Barbara ([[Mission Santa Barbara]]), among others.

[[Juan Bautista de Anza]] led a similarly important expedition throughout California in 1775–76, which would extend deeper into the interior and north of California. The Anza expedition selected numerous sites for missions, presidios, and pueblos, which subsequently would be established by settlers. [[Gabriel Moraga]], a member of the expedition, would also christen many of California's prominent rivers with their names in 1775–1776, such as the [[Sacramento River]] and the [[San Joaquin River]]. After the expedition, Gabriel's son, [[José Joaquín Moraga]], would found the pueblo of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] in 1777, making it the first civilian-established city in California.

In 1821, the [[Mexican War of Independence]] gave the [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire|Mexican Empire]] (which included California) independence from Spain. For the next 25 years, Alta California remained a remote, sparsely populated, northwestern administrative district of the newly independent country of Mexico, which shortly after independence became a republic. The [[Missions of California|missions]], which controlled most of the best land in the state, were [[secularized]] by 1834 and became the property of the Mexican government.<ref name=nps/> The governor granted many square leagues of land to others with political influence. These huge ''[[Ranchos of California|ranchos]]'' or cattle ranches emerged as the dominant institutions of Mexican California. The ranchos developed under ownership by [[Californio]]s (Hispanics native of California) who traded cowhides and tallow with Boston merchants. Beef did not become a commodity until the 1849 [[California Gold Rush]].

From the 1820s, trappers and settlers from the United States and Canada began to arrive in Northern California. These new arrivals used the [[Siskiyou Trail]], [[California Trail]], [[Oregon Trail]] and [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]] to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts in and surrounding California. The early government of the newly independent Mexico was highly unstable, and in a reflection of this, from 1831 onwards, California also experienced a series of armed disputes, both internal and with the central Mexican government.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Altman |first=Linda Jacobs |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=rAgL-tgWOecC|page=117}} |title=California |date=2005 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |isbn=978-0-7614-1737-8 |page=117 |access-date=March 16, 2013}}{{break}}{{cite book |title=Testimonios: Early California Through the Eyes of Women, 1815–1848 |url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=DuvFpaRwJlgC||page=425}} |access-date=March 16, 2013 |date=2006 |publisher=Heyday |isbn=978-1-59714-033-1 |page=425}}</ref> During this tumultuous political period [[Juan Bautista Alvarado]] was able to secure the governorship during 1836–1842.<ref>{{harvnb|Starr|2007|p=17}}{{break}}{{Cite book |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=AYMPR6xAj50C||page=316}} |title=Historic Spots in California |date=2002 |publisher=Historic Spots in California |isbn=978-0-8047-7817-6 |editor-last=Hoover |editor-first=Mildred Brooke |page=316 |access-date=March 16, 2013 |editor-last2=Kyle |editor-first2=Douglas E.}}{{break}}{{cite book |last=Conway |first=J.

One of the largest ranchers in California was [[John Marsh (pioneer)|John Marsh]]. After failing to obtain justice against squatters on his land from the Mexican courts, he determined that California should become part of the United States. Marsh conducted a letter-writing campaign espousing the California climate, the soil, and other reasons to settle there, as well as the best route to follow, which became known as "Marsh's route". His letters were read, reread, passed around, and printed in newspapers throughout the country, and started the first wagon trains rolling to California.<ref>Lyman, George D.

At the [[Battle of Providencia]] near Los Angeles, he convinced each side that they had no reason to be fighting each other. As a result of Marsh's actions, they abandoned the fight, Micheltorena was defeated, and California-born [[Pio Pico]] was returned to the governorship.

Following the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] (February 2, 1848) that ended the war, the westernmost portion of the annexed Mexican territory of Alta California soon became the American state of California, and the remainder of the old territory was then subdivided into the new American Territories of Arizona, Nevada, [[Colorado]] and [[Utah]]. The even more lightly populated and arid lower region of old Baja California remained as a part of Mexico. In 1846, the total settler population of the western part of the old Alta California had been estimated to be no more than 8,000, plus about 100,000 Native Americans, down from about 300,000 before Hispanic settlement in 1769.<ref name="Osborne2012">{{Cite book |last=Osborne |first=Thomas J. |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=FvA3jL4CFCMC}} |title=Pacific Eldorado: A History of Greater California |date=November 29, 2012 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1-118-29217-4}}</ref>

In 1848, only one week before the official American annexation of the area, gold was discovered in California, this being an event which was to forever alter both the state's demographics and its finances. Soon afterward, a massive influx of immigration into the area resulted, as prospectors and miners arrived by the thousands. The population burgeoned with United States citizens, Europeans, Middle Easterns, Chinese and other immigrants during the great [[California gold rush]]. By the time of California's application for statehood in 1850, the settler population of California had multiplied to 100,000.

On September 9, 1850, as part of the [[Compromise of 1850]], California became a [[Slave states and free states|free state]] and September{{spaces}}9 a [[California Admission Day|state holiday]].

During the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), California sent gold shipments eastward to Washington [[California in the American Civil War|in support of the Union]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.civilwar.org/learn/articles/10-facts-california-during-civil-war |title=10 Facts: California during the Civil War |work=American Battlefield Trust |date=August 13, 2013 |access-date=September 9, 2017}}</ref> However, due to the existence of a large contingent of pro-South sympathizers within the state, the state was not able to muster any full military regiments to send eastwards to officially serve in the Union war effort. Still, several smaller military units within the Union army, such as the [[2nd Regiment of Cavalry, Massachusetts Volunteers|"California 100 Company"]], were unofficially associated with the state of California due to a majority of their members being from California.

At the time of California's admission into the Union, travel between California and the rest of the continental United States had been a time-consuming and dangerous feat. Nineteen years later, and seven years after it was greenlighted by President Lincoln, the [[first transcontinental railroad]] was completed in 1869. California was then reachable from the eastern States in a week's time.

Much of the state was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general. Vast expanses of wheat, other cereal crops, vegetable crops, cotton, and nut and fruit trees were grown (including oranges in Southern California), and the foundation was laid for the state's prodigious agricultural production in the Central Valley and elsewhere.

In the nineteenth century, a large number of migrants from China traveled to the state as part of the [[Gold Rush]] or to seek work.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Chinese Experience in 19th Century America |url=http://teachingresources.atlas.illinois.edu/chinese_exp/introduction04.html |website=teachingresources.atlas.illinois.edu}}</ref> Even though the Chinese proved indispensable in building the transcontinental railroad from California to Utah, perceived job competition with the Chinese led to anti-Chinese riots in the state, and eventually the US ended migration from China partially as a response to pressure from California with the 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Immigration to the United States, 1851-1900 {{!}} Rise of Industrial America, 1876-1900 {{!}} U.S. History Primary Source Timeline {{!}} Classroom Materials at the Library of Congress {{!}} Library of Congress |url=https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/united-states-history-primary-source-timeline/rise-of-industrial-america-1876-1900/immigration-to-united-states-1851-1900/ |website=Library of Congress}}</ref>

As in other American states, indigenous peoples were forcibly removed from their lands by American [[settler]]s, like miners, ranchers, and farmers.

Migration to California accelerated during the early 20th century with the completion of transcontinental highways like the [[U.S. Route 66 (California)|Route 66]]. From 1900 to 1965, the population grew from fewer than one million to the greatest in the Union. In 1940, the Census Bureau reported California's population as 6% Hispanic, 2.4% Asian, and 90% non-Hispanic white.<ref>{{Cite web |title=California—Race and Hispanic Origin: 1850 to 1990 |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224151538/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |archive-date=December 24, 2014 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}</ref>

To meet the population's needs, engineering feats like the [[California Aqueduct|California]] and [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]]s; the [[Oroville Dam|Oroville]] and [[Shasta Dam]]s; and the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay]] and [[Golden Gate Bridge|Golden Gate]] Bridges were built. The state government adopted the [[California Master Plan for Higher Education]] in 1960 to develop an efficient system of public education.

Housing prices in urban areas continued to increase; a modest home which in the 1960s cost $25,000 would cost half a million dollars or more in urban areas by 2005. More people commuted longer hours to afford a home in more rural areas while earning larger salaries in the urban areas. Speculators bought houses, expecting to make a huge profit in months, then rolling it over by buying more properties. [[Mortgage]] companies were compliant, as people assumed prices would keep rising. The [[subprime mortgage crisis|bubble burst]] in 2007–8 as prices began to crash.

In the middle of the state lies the [[California Central Valley]], bounded by the Sierra Nevada in the east, the [[Pacific Coast Ranges|coastal mountain ranges]] in the west, the [[Cascade Range]] to the north and by the [[Tehachapi Mountains]] in the south. The Central Valley is California's productive agricultural heartland.

Divided in two by the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta]], the northern portion, the [[Sacramento Valley]] serves as the watershed of the [[Sacramento River]], while the southern portion, the [[San Joaquin Valley]] is the watershed for the [[San Joaquin River]]. Both valleys derive their names from the rivers that flow through them. With dredging, the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers have remained deep enough for several inland cities to be [[seaport]]s.

[[File:1 yosemite valley tunnel view 2010.JPG|thumb|[[Yosemite]], in the [[Sierra Nevada]]]]
The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is a critical water supply hub for the state. Water is diverted from the delta and through an extensive network of [[pump (Water)|pumps]] and canals that traverse nearly the length of the state, to the Central Valley and the State Water Projects and other needs. Water from the Delta provides drinking water for nearly 23{{spaces}}million people, almost two-thirds of the state's population as well as water for farmers on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley.

[[Suisun Bay]] lies at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. The water is drained by the [[Carquinez Strait]], which flows into [[San Pablo Bay]], a northern extension of [[San Francisco Bay]], which then connects to the [[Pacific Ocean]] via the [[Golden Gate]] strait.

The [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]] are located off the [[South Coast (California)|Southern coast]], while the [[Farallon Islands]] lie west of San Francisco.

To the east of the Sierra Nevada are [[Owens Valley]] and [[Mono Lake]], an essential [[bird migration|migratory bird]] habitat. In the western part of the state is [[Clear Lake (California)|Clear Lake]], the largest freshwater lake by area entirely in California. Although Lake Tahoe is larger, it is divided by the California/Nevada border.

In the south is a large inland salt lake, the [[Salton Sea]]. The south-central desert is called the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]]; to the northeast of the Mojave lies [[Death Valley]], which contains the lowest and hottest place in North America, the [[Badwater Basin]] at {{convert|−279|ft|m}}.<ref name=NED/> The horizontal distance from the bottom of Death Valley to the top of Mount Whitney is less than {{convert|90|mi|km}}. Indeed, almost all of southeastern California is arid, hot desert, with routine extreme high temperatures during the summer. The southeastern border of California with Arizona is entirely formed by the [[Colorado River]], from which the southern part of the state gets about half of its water.

A majority of California's cities are located in either the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] or the [[Sacramento metropolitan area]] in [[Northern California]]; or the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area|Los Angeles area]], the [[Inland Empire]], or the [[San Diego metropolitan area]] in [[Southern California]]. The Los Angeles Area, the Bay Area, and the San Diego metropolitan area are among several major metropolitan areas along the California coast.

[[File:Köppen Climate Types California.png|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate]] types in California]]

Most of the state has a [[Mediterranean climate]]. The cool [[California Current]] offshore often creates summer [[fog]] near the coast. Farther inland, there are colder winters and hotter summers. The maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of Los Angeles and [[San Francisco]] being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the United States and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the North American continent. Even the [[San Diego]] shoreline bordering Mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous United States. Just a few miles inland, summer temperature extremes are significantly higher, with downtown Los Angeles being several degrees [[Climate of the Los Angeles Basin|warmer]] than at the coast. The same [[microclimate]] phenomenon is seen in the [[San Francisco Bay Area#Climate|climate of the Bay Area]], where areas sheltered from the ocean experience significantly hotter summers and colder winters in contrast with nearby areas closer to the ocean.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wrcc.dri.edu/|title=Western Regional Climate Center|website=wrcc.dri.edu}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/California-state/Climate|title=California - Climate &#124; Britannica|website=www.britannica.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.differencebetween.net/science/difference-between-coastal-and-inland-climates/|title=Difference Between Coastal and Inland Climates|date=October 26, 2020}}</ref>

Northern parts of the state have more rain than the south. California's mountain ranges also influence the climate: some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes. Coastal northwestern California has a [[temperate climate]], and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast. The high mountains, including the Sierra Nevada, have an [[alpine climate]] with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer.

California's mountains produce [[rain shadow]]s on the eastern side, creating extensive [[desert]]s. The higher elevation deserts of [[eastern California]] have hot summers and cold winters, while the low deserts east of the Southern California mountains have hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters. [[Death Valley]], a desert with large expanses below sea level, is considered the hottest location in the world; the highest temperature in the world,<ref name="newRecord">{{Cite journal |last=El Fadli |first=K.

California's large number of [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species includes [[Relict (biology)|relict]] species, which have died out elsewhere, such as the Catalina ironwood (''[[Lyonothamnus floribundus]]''). Many other endemics originated through differentiation or [[adaptive radiation]], whereby multiple species develop from a common ancestor to take advantage of diverse ecological conditions such as the California lilac (''[[Ceanothus]]'').{{citation needed|date=May 2024}} Many California endemics have become endangered, as urbanization, logging, [[overgrazing]], and the introduction of [[exotic species]] have encroached on their habitat.

California boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora: the [[giant sequoia|largest trees]], the [[coast redwood|tallest trees]], and the [[pinus longaeva|oldest trees]]. California's native grasses are [[perennial plant]]s,<ref name="Restoring Native Grasses">{{Cite journal |last=David Elstein |date=May 2004 |title=Restoring California's Native Grasses |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/may04/grass0504.htm |journal=Agricultural Research Magazine |volume=52 |issue=5 |page=17 |access-date=December 25, 2009}}</ref> and there are close to hundred succulent species native to the state.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}} After European contact, these were generally replaced by [[invasive species]] of European annual grasses; and, in modern times, California's hills turn a characteristic golden-brown in summer.<ref name="The California Invasive Species List">{{Cite web |date=April 21, 2010 |title=The California Invasive Species List |url=http://www.iscc.ca.gov/docs/CaliforniaInvasiveSpeciesList.pdf |access-date=October 5, 2010 |publisher=iscc.ca.gov (California Invasive Species Advisory Committee)}}</ref>

Because California has the greatest diversity of climate and terrain, the state has six life zones which are the lower [[Sonoran Desert]]; upper Sonoran (foothill regions and some coastal lands), transition (coastal areas and moist northeastern counties); and the Canadian, Hudsonian, and Arctic Zones, comprising the state's highest elevations.<ref name="California: flora and fauna">{{Cite web |date=2010 |title=California: flora and fauna |url=http://www.city-data.com/states/California-Flora-and-fauna.html |access-date=September 7, 2010 |publisher=city-data.com}}</ref>

Plant life in the dry climate of the lower Sonoran zone contains a diversity of native cactus, mesquite, and paloverde. The [[Yucca brevifolia|Joshua tree]] is found in the Mojave Desert. Flowering plants include the dwarf desert poppy and a variety of [[aster (genus)|asters]]. [[Fremont cottonwood]] and [[valley oak]] thrive in the Central Valley. The upper Sonoran zone includes the chaparral belt, characterized by forests of small shrubs, stunted trees, and herbaceous plants. ''[[Nemophila]]'', [[Lamiaceae|mint]], ''[[Phacelia]]'', ''[[viola (plant)|Viola]]'', and the California poppy (''[[Eschscholzia californica]]'', the state flower) also flourish in this zone, along with the lupine, more species of which occur here than anywhere else in the world.<ref name="California: flora and fauna" />

The transition zone includes most of California's forests with the redwood (''[[Sequoia sempervirens]]'') and the "big tree" or giant sequoia (''[[Sequoiadendron giganteum]]''), among the oldest living things on earth (some are said to have lived at least 4,000 years). [[Tanbark oak]], [[California laurel]], [[sugar pine]], [[Arbutus|madrona]], [[Acer macrophyllum|broad-leaved maple]], and [[Douglas-fir]] also grow here. Forest floors are covered with [[Polystichum|swordfern]], alumnroot, [[barrenwort]], and [[trillium]], and there are thickets of [[huckleberry]], [[azalea]], elder, and wild currant. Characteristic wild flowers include varieties of mariposa, [[tulip]], and [[Lilium columbianum|tiger]] and [[Lilium pardalinum|leopard]] lilies.<ref name="Sequoia sempervirens (D.

The high elevations of the Canadian zone allow the [[Jeffrey pine]], [[red fir]], and [[lodgepole pine]] to thrive. Brushy areas are abundant with dwarf [[manzanita]] and ceanothus; the unique [[Calvatia sculpta|Sierra puffball]] is also found here. Right below the timberline, in the Hudsonian zone, the whitebark, foxtail, and silver pines grow. At about {{convert|10500|ft|m}}, begins the Arctic zone, a treeless region whose flora include a number of wildflowers, including [[Primula suffrutescens|Sierra primrose]], [[Aquilegia flavescens|yellow columbine]], [[Ranunculus|alpine buttercup]], and [[Dodecatheon alpinum|alpine shooting star]].<ref name="California: flora and fauna" /><ref name="Life Zones of the Central Sierra Nevada">{{Cite web |title=Life Zones of the Central Sierra Nevada |url=http://www.sierrahistorical.org/archives/lifezones.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301063716/http://www.sierrahistorical.org/archives/lifezones.html |archive-date=March 1, 2012 |access-date=October 5, 2010 |publisher=sierrahistorical.org}}</ref>

[[Palm trees]] are a well-known feature of California, particularly in [[Southern California]] and [[Los Angeles]]; many species have been imported, though the ''Washington filifera'' (commonly known as the ''California fan palm'') is native to the state, mainly growing in the [[Colorado Desert]] oases.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.kcet.org/shows/lost-la/a-brief-history-of-palm-trees-in-southern-california |title= A Brief History of Palm Trees in Southern California |last= Masters|first= Nathan |date=December 7, 2011 |website= kcet.org |publisher= Public Media Group of Southern California/[[KCET]]/[[PBS]] |access-date= August 16, 2023}}</ref> Other common plants that have been introduced to the state include the [[eucalyptus]], [[acacia]], [[Schinus|pepper tree]], geranium, and [[Scotch broom]].

[[File:Tule Elk - Merced National Wildlife Refuge Bill Leikam 12-03-2010.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Tule Elk]] in the [[San Joaquin Valley]]]]
In the deserts of the lower Sonoran zone, the mammals include the [[jackrabbit]], [[kangaroo rat]], squirrel, and opossum. Common birds include the [[owl]], [[roadrunner]], [[cactus wren]], and various species of hawk. The area's reptilian life include the [[Crotalus cerastes|sidewinder viper]], [[desert tortoise]], and [[horned toad]]. The upper Sonoran zone boasts mammals such as the [[Pronghorn|antelope]], [[Dusky-footed woodrat|brown-footed woodrat]], and [[ring-tailed cat]].

In the transition zone, there are Colombian [[black-tailed deer]], [[American black bear|black bears]], [[gray fox]]es, [[cougar]]s, [[bobcat]]s, and [[Roosevelt elk]]. Reptiles such as the garter snakes and rattlesnakes inhabit the zone. In addition, amphibians such as the [[Proteidae|water puppy]] and [[Batrachoseps attenuatus|redwood salamander]] are common too. Birds such as the [[kingfisher]], chickadee, [[towhee]], and hummingbird thrive here as well.<ref name="California: flora and fauna" /><ref name="Black-tailed Deer of California">{{Cite web |date=2000 |title=Black-tailed Deer of California |url=http://www.westernhunter.com/Pages/Vol02Issue24/blacktail.html |access-date=October 7, 2010 |publisher=westernhunter.com}}</ref>

The Canadian zone mammals include the [[mountain weasel]], [[snowshoe hare]], and several species of chipmunks. Conspicuous birds include the [[Steller's jay|blue-fronted jay]], [[mountain chickadee]], [[hermit thrush]], [[American dipper]], and [[Townsend's solitaire]]. As one ascends into the Hudsonian zone, birds become scarcer. While the [[gray-crowned rosy finch]] is the only bird native to the high Arctic region, other bird species such as [[Anna's hummingbird]] and [[Clark's nutcracker]]. Principal mammals found in this region include the Sierra coney, [[white-tailed jackrabbit]], and the [[bighorn sheep]]. {{As of|2003|04}}, the bighorn sheep was listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The fauna found throughout several zones are the [[mule deer]], [[coyote]], [[mountain lion]], [[northern flicker]], and several species of hawk and sparrow.<ref name="California: flora and fauna" />
[[File:Methuselah Walk USA Ca.jpg|thumb|[[Methuselah (pine tree)|Methuselah]] is the [[List of oldest trees|oldest tree in the world]], found in the [[Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest]] of [[Inyo National Forest]].]]
Aquatic life in California thrives, from the state's mountain lakes and streams to the rocky Pacific coastline. Numerous trout species are found, among them [[Rainbow trout|rainbow]], [[Golden trout|golden]], and [[Cutthroat trout|cutthroat]]. Migratory species of salmon are common as well. Deep-sea life forms include [[White seabass|sea bass]], [[yellowfin tuna]], [[barracuda]], and several types of whale. Native to the cliffs of northern California are seals, sea lions, and many types of shorebirds, including migratory species.<ref name="California: flora and fauna" />

{{as of|2003|April}}, 118 California animals were on the federal endangered list; 181 plants were listed as endangered or threatened. Endangered animals include the [[Vulpes macrotis|San Joaquin kitfox]], [[Aplodontia rufa nigra|Point Arena mountain beaver]], [[Pacific pocket mouse]], [[salt marsh harvest mouse]], [[Morro Bay kangaroo rat]] (and five other species of kangaroo rat), [[California vole#Subspecies|Amargosa vole]], [[California least tern]], [[California condor]], [[loggerhead shrike]], [[Bell's sparrow|San Clemente sage sparrow]], [[San Francisco garter snake]], five species of salamander, three species of chub, and two species of pupfish.

===Rivers===
{{main|List of rivers of California}}
[[File:View of the Bay Area and the Californian Delta.jpg|thumb|left|[[San Francisco Bay]] (center left) and the [[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta|California Delta]] (top right)]]
The most prominent river system within California is formed by the Sacramento River and [[San Joaquin River]], which are fed mostly by snowmelt from the west slope of the Sierra Nevada, and respectively drain the north and south halves of the Central Valley. The two rivers join in the [[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta]], flowing into the Pacific Ocean through [[San Francisco Bay]]. Many major tributaries feed into the Sacramento–San Joaquin system, including the [[Pit River]], [[Feather River]] and [[Tuolumne River]].

The [[Klamath River|Klamath]] and [[Trinity River (California)|Trinity Rivers]] drain a large area in far northwestern California. The [[Eel River (California)|Eel River]] and [[Salinas River (California)|Salinas River]] each drain portions of the California coast, north and south of San Francisco Bay, respectively. The [[Mojave River]] is the primary watercourse in the Mojave Desert, and the [[Santa Ana River]] drains much of the [[Transverse Ranges]] as it bisects Southern California. The [[Colorado River]] forms the state's southeast border with Arizona.

Most of California's major rivers are dammed as part of two massive water projects: the [[Central Valley Project]], providing water for agriculture in the Central Valley, and the [[California State Water Project]] diverting water from Northern to Southern California. The state's coasts, rivers, and other bodies of water are regulated by the [[California Coastal Commission]].

[[File:Southern California counties in red noshade.png|thumb|right|Map showing the division between [[Northern California]] (top white) and [[Southern California]] (bottom red)]]
California is traditionally separated into [[Northern California]] and [[Southern California]], divided by a straight border which runs across the state, separating the northern 48 counties from the southern 10 counties. Despite the persistence of the northern-southern divide, California is more precisely divided into many regions, multiple of which stretch across the northern-southern divide.

California has long been a subject of interest in the public mind and has often been promoted by its boosters as a kind of paradise. In the early 20th century, fueled by the efforts of state, the building projects during the [[Great Depression]] and local boosters, many Americans saw the Golden State as an ideal resort destination, sunny and dry all year round with easy access to the ocean and mountains. In the 1960s, popular music groups such as [[the Beach Boys]] promoted the image of Californians as laid-back, tanned beach-goers.

With the passage of [[California Proposition 30 (2012)|Proposition 30 in 2012]] and [[2016 California Proposition 55|Proposition 55 in 2016]], California now levies a 13.3% maximum marginal [[income tax]] rate with ten [[tax bracket]]s, ranging from 1% at the bottom tax bracket of $0 annual individual income to 13.3% for annual individual income over $1,000,000 (though the top brackets are only temporary until Proposition 55 expires at the end of 2030). While Proposition 30 also enacted a minimum [[sales taxes in the United States#California|state sales tax]] of 7.5%, this sales tax increase was not extended by Proposition 55 and reverted to a previous minimum state sales tax rate of 7.25% in 2017. Local governments can and do levy additional sales taxes in addition to this minimum rate.<ref>{{Cite web |title=California Proposition 30, Sales and Income Tax Increase (2012) |url=http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_30,_Sales_and_Income_Tax_Increase_(2012)#cite_note-taxfoundation_states-6 |access-date=January 16, 2013 |publisher=Ballotpedia}}</ref>

All [[real property]] is taxable annually. Property tax increases are capped at 2% annually or the rate of inflation (whichever is lower), per [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13]].

Because it is the most populous state in the United States, California is one of the country's largest users of energy. The state has extensive hydro-electric energy generation facilities, however, moving water is the single largest energy use in the state. Also, due to high energy rates, conservation mandates, mild weather in the largest population centers and strong [[environmental movement]], its ''per capita'' energy use is one of the smallest of any state in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Mufson |first=Steven |date=February 17, 2007 |title=In Energy Conservation, Calif.

The [[California oil and gas industry|state's crude oil and natural gas deposits]] are located in the Central Valley and [[Offshore oil and gas in California|along the coast]], including the large [[Midway-Sunset Oil Field]]. Natural gas-fired [[List of power stations in California|power plants]] typically account for more than one-half of state electricity generation.

As a result of the state's strong environmental movement, California has some of the most aggressive [[Renewable energy in California|renewable energy]] goals in the United States. The Clean Energy, Jobs and Affordability Act of 2022 commits the state to running its operations on clean, renewable energy resources by 2035, and SB 1203 also requires the state to achieve net-zero operations for all agencies. Currently, several [[Solar power in California|solar power plants]] such as the [[Solar Energy Generating Systems]] facility are located in the [[Mojave Desert]].

====Highways====
California's vast terrain is connected by [[California Freeway and Expressway System|an extensive system]] of [[controlled-access highways]] ('freeways'), [[limited-access road]]s ('expressways'), and [[State highways in California|highways]]. California is known for its [[car culture]], giving California's cities a reputation for severe [[traffic congestion]]. Construction and maintenance of state roads and statewide transportation planning are primarily the responsibility of the [[California Department of Transportation]], nicknamed "Caltrans".

(2001). The great thirst: Californians and water. Berkeley, Calif.: University of California Press.</ref> Water use and conservation in California is a politically divisive issue, as the state experiences periodic droughts and has to balance the demands of its large agricultural and urban sectors, especially in the arid southern portion of the state. The state's widespread redistribution of water also invites the frequent scorn of environmentalists.

The [[California Water Wars]], a conflict between Los Angeles and the Owens Valley over water rights, is one of the most well-known examples of the struggle to secure adequate water supplies.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Reisner, Marc |title=Cadillac Desert: The American West and its Disappearing Water |date=1993 |publisher=Penguin}}</ref> Former California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] said: <blockquote>We've been in crisis for quite some time because we're now 38{{spaces}}million people and not anymore 18{{spaces}}million people like we were in the late 60s.

{{Main|Local government in California}}
[[File:San Francisco City Hall September 2013 panorama 3.jpg|left|thumb|[[San Francisco City Hall]] is the seat of government of the consolidated [[Government of San Francisco|City and County of San Francisco]].]]
California has an extensive system of local government that manages public functions throughout the state. Like most states, California is divided into [[County (United States)|counties]], of which there are 58 (including [[San Francisco]]) covering the entire state. Most urbanized areas are incorporated as [[city|cities]]. [[List of school districts in California|School districts]], which are independent of cities and counties, handle public education. Many other functions, such as fire protection and water supply, especially in [[unincorporated area]]s, are handled by [[Special-purpose district|special district]]s.

====Counties====
{{See also|List of counties in California}}

California is divided into [[List of counties in California|58 counties]]. Per Article 11, Section 1, of the [[Constitution of California]], they are the legal subdivisions of the state. The county government provides countywide services such as [[Law enforcement in California|law enforcement]], [[List of California county jails|jails]], elections and voter registration, vital records, property assessment and records, tax collection, public health, health care, social services, libraries, flood control, fire protection, animal control, agricultural regulations, building inspections, ambulance services, and education departments in charge of maintaining statewide standards.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Baldassare |first=Mark |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=sDs4WZV0SRsC|page=67}} |title=When Government Fails: The Orange County Bankruptcy |date=1998 |publisher=[[Public Policy Institute of California]]/[[University of California Press]] |isbn=978-0-520-21486-6 |pages=67–68 |lccn=97032806}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Janiskee |first1=Brian P. |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=23Y3Nxs0qWgC|page=105}} |title=Democracy in California: Politics and Government in the Golden State |last2=Masugi |first2=Ken |date=2011 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |isbn=978-1-4422-0338-9 |edition=3rd |page=105 |lccn=2011007585}}</ref> In addition, the county serves as the local government for all [[unincorporated area]]s.

====City and town governments====
{{see also|List of municipalities in California}}
[[File:Los Angeles City Hall 01 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Los Angeles City Hall]], seat of the [[Government of Los Angeles]]]]
Incorporated cities and towns in California are either [[Charter city|charter]] or general-law municipalities.<ref name="Cal Gov Code 34502" /> General-law municipalities owe their existence to state law and are consequently governed by it; charter municipalities are governed by their own city or town charters. Municipalities incorporated in the 19th century tend to be charter municipalities. All ten of the state's most populous cities are charter cities. Most small cities have a [[Council–manager government|council–manager]] form of government, where the elected city council appoints a city manager to supervise the operations of the city. Some larger cities have a directly elected mayor who oversees the city government. In many council-manager cities, the city council selects one of its members as a mayor, sometimes rotating through the council membership—but this type of mayoral position is primarily ceremonial. The [[Government of San Francisco]] is the only [[consolidated city-county]] in California, where both the city and county governments have been merged into one unified jurisdiction.

Most of California's special districts are ''single-purpose districts'', and provide one service.

In the [[2016 United States presidential election]], California had the third highest percentage of Democratic votes behind [[Washington, D.C.|the District of Columbia]] and [[Hawaii]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2016&off=0&elect=0&f=0|title=2016 Presidential General Election Results}}</ref> In the [[2020 United States presidential election#Results by state|2020 United States presidential election]], it had the 6th highest behind the District of Columbia, [[Vermont]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Maryland]], and Hawaii. According to the Cook Political Report, California contains five of the 15 most Democratic congressional districts in the United States.

California was the second state [[California gubernatorial recall election, 2003|to recall their state governor]], the second state to legalize abortion, and the only state to ban marriage for gay couples twice by vote (including [[California Proposition 8|Proposition{{spaces}}8]] in 2008). Voters also passed [[California Proposition 71 (2004)|Proposition 71 in 2004]] to fund [[stem cell]] research, making California the [[Stem cell laws and policy in the United States#Legalization and funding|second state to legalize stem cell research]], and [[California Proposition 14 (2010)|Proposition 14 in 2010]] to completely change the state's [[Partisan primary|primary election]] process. California has also experienced [[California Water Wars|disputes over water rights]]; and a [[tax revolt]], culminating with the passage of [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13 in 1978]], limiting state [[property tax]]es. California voters have rejected [[affirmative action]] on multiple occasions, most recently in November 2020.

The state's trend towards the [[California Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] and away from the [[California Republican Party|Republican Party]] can be seen in state elections. From 1899 to 1939, California had exclusively Republican governors. Since 1990, California has generally elected Democratic candidates to federal, state and local offices, including current Governor [[Gavin Newsom]]; however, the state has elected Republican Governors, though many of its Republican Governors, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, tend to be considered moderate Republicans and more [[Centrism|centrist]] than the national party.

Several political movements have advocated for [[Partition and secession in California|California independence]]. The [[California National Party]] and the [[California Freedom Coalition]] both advocate for California independence along the lines of [[Progressivism in the United States|progressivism]] and [[civic nationalism]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jim Miller |title=California could see new political party with independence goal |url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article54004530.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308223549/http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article54004530.html |archive-date=March 8, 2016 |access-date=March 19, 2016 |website=[[Sacramento Bee]]}}</ref> The [[Yes California]] movement attempted to organize an independence referendum via [[ballot initiative]] for 2019, which was then postponed.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tech Insider |date=November 9, 2016 |title=What is 'Calexit' and how can California secede from the US? |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/calexit-explainer-california-plans-to-secede-2016-11 |access-date=March 31, 2017 |website=Business Insider}}</ref>

The Democrats also hold a supermajority in both houses of the state legislature. There are 62 Democrats and 18 Republicans in the Assembly; and 32 Democrats and eight Republicans in the Senate.

From [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] through [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]], California was a Republican-leaning state, as the party carried the state's electoral votes in nine of ten elections, with [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]] as the sole exception. Southern California Republicans [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] were both elected twice as the 37th and 40th U.S. Presidents, respectively. However, Democrats have won all of California's electoral votes for the last eight elections,<!--8 thru 2020--> starting in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]].

In the United States House, the Democrats held a 34–19 edge in the California delegation of the [[110th United States Congress]] in 2007. As the result of [[gerrymandering]], the districts in California were usually dominated by one or the other party, and few districts were considered competitive. In 2008, Californians passed Proposition 20 to empower a 14-member independent citizen commission to redraw districts for both local politicians and Congress. After the 2012 elections, when the new system took effect, Democrats gained four seats and held a 38–15 majority in the delegation. Following the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|2018 midterm House elections]], Democrats won 46 out of 53 congressional house seats in California, leaving Republicans with seven.

In general, Democratic strength is centered in the populous [[Coastal California|coastal regions]] of the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Republican strength is still greatest in eastern parts of the state. [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] had remained largely Republican until the 2016 and 2018 elections, in which a majority of the county's votes were cast for Democratic candidates.<ref>{{Cite web |title=2016 Presidential General Election |url=http://www.ocvote.com/fileadmin/live/gen2016/results.htm |access-date=November 10, 2016 |website=Ocvote.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Thornton |first=Paul |date=November 10, 2018 |title=RIP Republican Orange County |work=Los Angeles Times |url=https://latimes.com/la-ol-opinion-newsletter-midterm-election-20181110-htmlstory.html}}</ref> One study ranked [[Berkeley California|Berkeley]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] and [[San Francisco]] in the top 20 most liberal American cities; and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], [[Orange, California|Orange]], [[Escondido, California|Escondido]], [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]], and [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]] in the top 20 most conservative cities.<ref>{{Cite web |date=August 16, 2005 |title=Study Ranks America's Most Liberal and Conservative Cities |url=http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501140306/http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html |archive-date=May 1, 2011 |access-date=February 20, 2011 |publisher=Bay Area Center for Voting Research}}</ref>
