First settled in 1786, Knoxville was the first capital of Tennessee.

Knoxville is also home to the headquarters of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]]'s courthouse for East Tennessee, and the corporate headquarters of several national and regional companies.

{{Main|History of Knoxville, Tennessee}}
{{For timeline}}

===Early history===
The first people to form substantial settlements in what is now Knoxville were indigenous people who arrived during the [[Woodland period]] ({{c.}} 1000 B.C. to 1000 A.D.).<ref name="Fletcher Jolly III 1976">Fletcher Jolly III, "40KN37: An Early Woodland Habitation Site in Knox County, Tennessee", ''Tennessee Archaeologist'' 31, nos. 1–2 (1976), 51.</ref> One of the oldest artificial structures in Knoxville is a [[University of Tennessee Agriculture Farm Mound|burial mound]] constructed during the early [[Mississippian culture]] period ({{c.}} 1000–1400 A.D.). The earthwork mound has been preserved, but the campus of the University of Tennessee developed around it.<ref>Frank H. McClung Museum, "[http://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/permanent/native/woodland.shtml Woodland Period] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412122905/http://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/permanent/native/woodland.shtml |date=April 12, 2012 }}". Retrieved: March 25, 2008.</ref>

Other prehistoric sites include an Early Woodland habitation area at the confluence of the Tennessee River and Knob Creek (near the [[Knox County, Tennessee|Knox]]–[[Blount County, Tennessee|Blount]] county line),<ref name="Fletcher Jolly III 1976"/> and [[Dallas phase]] Mississippian villages at Post Oak Island (also along the river near the Knox–Blount line),<ref>James Strange, "An Unusual Late Prehistoric Pipe from Post Oak Island (40KN23)", ''Tennessee Archaeologist'' 30, no. 1 (1974), 80.</ref> and at [[Bussell Island]] (at the mouth of the [[Little Tennessee River]] near [[Lenoir City, Tennessee|Lenoir City]]).<ref>Richard Polhemus, ''The Toqua Site—40MR6'', Vol. I (Norris, Tenn.: Tennessee Valley Authority, 1987), 1240-1246.</ref>

By the 18th century, the [[Cherokee]], an [[Iroquoian language]] people, had become the dominant tribe in the East Tennessee region; they are believed to have migrated centuries before from the [[Great Lakes region]]. They were frequently at war with the [[Muscogee|Creek]] and [[Shawnee]].<ref>Cora Tula Watters, "Shawnee". ''The Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 278–279.</ref><ref>Ima Stephens, "Creek", ''The Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 252–253.</ref> The Cherokee people called the Knoxville area ''kuwanda'talun'yi'', which means "mulberry place".<ref>[[James Mooney]], ''Myths of the Cherokee and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokee'' (Nashville: Charles Elder, 1972—reprint from 1891 and 1900), 526.</ref> Most Cherokee habitation in the area was concentrated in what the American colonists called the [[Overhill Cherokee|Overhill settlements]] along the [[Little Tennessee River]], southwest of Knoxville.

The first white traders and explorers were recorded as arriving in the [[Tennessee Valley]] in the late 17th century. There is significant evidence that Spanish explorer [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] visited Bussell Island in 1540.<ref>[[Jefferson Chapman]], ''Tellico Archaeology: 12,000 Years of Native American History'' (Norris, Tenn.: Tennessee Valley Authority, 1985), 97.</ref> The first major recorded Euro-American presence in the Knoxville area was the [[Timberlake Expedition]], which passed through the confluence of the [[Holston River|Holston]] and [[French Broad River|French Broad]] into the Tennessee River in December 1761. [[Henry Timberlake]], an Anglo-American emissary from the [[Thirteen Colonies]] to the Overhill settlements, recalled being pleased by the deep waters of the Tennessee after his party had struggled down the relatively shallow Holston for several weeks.<ref>Henry Timberlake, Samuel Williams (ed.), ''Memoirs, 1756–1765'' (Marietta, Georgia: Continental Book Co., 1948), 54.</ref>

===Settlement===
[[File:James White's Fort 20.jpg|thumb|[[James White's Fort]] in downtown Knoxville]]
The end of the [[French and Indian War]] and confusion brought about by the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]] led to a drastic increase in Euro-American settlement west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].<ref>William MacArthur, ''Knoxville, Crossroads of the New South'' (Tulsa, Okla.: Continental Heritage Press, 1982), 1-15.</ref> By the 1780s, white settlers were already established in the Holston and French Broad valleys. The U.S. Congress ordered all illegal settlers out of the valley in 1785 but with little success. As settlers continued to trickle into Cherokee lands, tensions between the settlers and the Cherokee rose steadily.<ref>Yong Kim, ''The Sevierville Hill Site: A Civil War Union Encampment on the Southern Heights of Knoxville, Tennessee'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Transportation Center, 1993), 9.</ref>

In 1786, [[James White (general)|James White]], a [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] officer, and his friend James Connor built [[James White's Fort|White's Fort]] near the mouth of First Creek, on land White had purchased three years earlier.<ref name="ReferenceA">Kim, ''The Sevierville Hill Site'', 9.</ref> In 1790, White's son-in-law, [[Charles McClung]]—who had arrived from Pennsylvania the previous year—surveyed White's holdings between First Creek and Second Creek for the establishment of a town. McClung drew up sixty-four {{convert|0.5|acre|adj=on}} lots. The waterfront was set aside for a town common. Two lots were set aside for a church and graveyard (First Presbyterian Church, founded 1792). Four lots were set aside for a school. That school was eventually chartered as Blount College and it served as the starting point for the [[University of Tennessee]], which uses Blount College's founding date of 1794 as its own.

In 1790, President [[George Washington]] appointed North Carolina surveyor [[William Blount]] governor of the newly created [[Territory South of the River Ohio]]. One of Blount's first tasks was to meet with the Cherokee and establish territorial boundaries and resolve the issue of illegal settlers.<ref>MacArthur, 17.</ref> This he accomplished almost immediately with the [[Treaty of Holston]], which was negotiated and signed at White's Fort in 1791. Blount originally wanted to place the territorial capital at the confluence of the [[Clinch River]] and Tennessee River (now [[Kingston, Tennessee|Kingston]]), but when the Cherokee refused to cede this land, Blount chose White's Fort. Blount named the new capital Knoxville after Revolutionary War General and Secretary of War [[Henry Knox]], who at the time was Blount's immediate superior.<ref>William MacArthur, Jr., ''Knoxville: Crossroads of the New South'' (Tulsa, Oklahoma: Continental Heritage Press, 1982), 17-22.</ref>

Problems immediately arose from the Holston Treaty. Blount believed that he had "purchased" much of what is now East Tennessee when the treaty was signed in 1791. However, the terms of the treaty came under dispute, culminating in ongoing violence on both sides. When the government invited Cherokee chief [[Hanging Maw]] for negotiations in 1793, Knoxville settlers attacked the Cherokee against orders, killing the chief's wife. Peace was renegotiated in 1794.<ref>G. H. Stueckrath, "[http://www.knoxcotn.org/history/debow.html Incidents in the Early Settlement of East Tennessee and Knoxville] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401050724/http://www.knoxcotn.org/history/debow.html |date=April 1, 2009 }}".

===Antebellum era===
[[File:Craighead-Jackson House 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Craighead-Jackson House]] in Knoxville, built in 1818]]

Knoxville served as capital of the Southwest Territory and as capital of Tennessee (admitted as a state in 1796) until 1817,<ref name="ReferenceA"/> when the capital was moved to [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]]. Early Knoxville has been described as an "alternately quiet and rowdy river town".<ref name="wheeler"/> Early issues of the ''[[The Knoxville Gazette|Knoxville Gazette]]''—the first newspaper published in Tennessee—are filled with accounts of murder, theft, and hostile Cherokee attacks. Abishai Thomas, a friend of William Blount, visited Knoxville in 1794 and wrote that, while he was impressed by the town's modern frame buildings, the town had "seven taverns" and no church.<ref>MacArthur, ''Knoxville: Crossroads of the New South'', 23.</ref>

Knoxville initially thrived as a way station for travelers and migrants heading west. Its location at the confluence of three major rivers in the Tennessee Valley brought [[flatboat]] and later [[steamboat]] traffic to its waterfront in the first half of the 19th century, and Knoxville quickly developed into a regional merchandising center. Local agricultural products—especially tobacco, corn, and whiskey—were traded for cotton, which was grown in the [[Deep South]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The population of Knoxville more than doubled in the 1850s with the arrival of the [[East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad]] in 1855.<ref name="wheeler"/>

Among the most prominent citizens of Knoxville during the Antebellum years was James White's son, [[Hugh Lawson White]] (1773–1840). White first served as a judge and state senator, before being nominated by the state legislature to replace [[Andrew Jackson]] in the U.S. Senate in 1825. In 1836, White ran unsuccessfully for president, representing the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].<ref>Jonathan Atkins, "[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=1497 Hugh Lawson White] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702071628/http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=1497 |date=July 2, 2017 }}".

Anti-slavery and anti-secession sentiment ran high in East Tennessee in the years leading up to the Civil War. [[Parson Brownlow|William "Parson" Brownlow]], the radical publisher of the [[Brownlow's Whig|Knoxville Whig]], was one of the region's leading anti-secessionists (although he strongly defended the practice of slavery).<ref>Forrest Conklin, "[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=150 William Gannaway "Parson" Brownlow] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210116/http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=150 |date=March 3, 2016 }}".

Business interests, however, guided largely by Knoxville's trade connections with cotton-growing centers to the south, contributed to the development of a strong pro-secession movement within the city. The city's pro-secessionists included among their ranks [[J. G. M. Ramsey]], a prominent historian whose father had built the [[Ramsey House (Knox County, Tennessee)|Ramsey House]] in 1797.

Thus, while East Tennessee and greater Knox County voted decisively against secession in 1861, the city of Knoxville favored secession by a 2–1 margin. In late May 1861, just before the secession vote, delegates of the [[East Tennessee Convention]] met at Temperance Hall in Knoxville in hopes of keeping Tennessee in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. After Tennessee voted to secede in June, the convention met in [[Greeneville, Tennessee|Greeneville]] and attempted to create a separate Union-aligned state in East Tennessee.<ref>MacArthur, ''Knoxville: Crossroads of the New South'', 42-44.</ref><ref>Eric Lacy, ''Vanquished Volunteers: East Tennessee Sectionalism from Statehood to Secession'' (Johnson City, Tenn.: East Tennessee State University Press, 1965), pp. 217–233.</ref>

[[File:Holstontreaty.JPG|thumb|Statue representing the signing of the Treaty of the Holston in downtown Knoxville]]In July 1861, after Tennessee had joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], General [[Felix Zollicoffer]] arrived in Knoxville as commander of the District of East Tennessee. While initially lenient toward the city's Union sympathizers, Zollicoffer instituted [[martial law]] in November, after pro-Union guerrillas [[East Tennessee bridge burnings|burned seven of the city's bridges]]. The command of the district passed briefly to [[George B. Crittenden|George Crittenden]] and then to [[Edmund Kirby Smith|Kirby Smith]], who launched an [[Confederate Heartland Offensive|unsuccessful invasion of Kentucky]] in August 1862. In early 1863, General [[Simon Bolivar Buckner|Simon Buckner]] took command of Confederate forces in Knoxville. Anticipating a Union invasion, Buckner fortified Fort Loudon (in West Knoxville, not to be confused with the [[Fort Loudoun (Tennessee)|colonial fort]] to the southwest) and began constructing earthworks throughout the city. However, the approach of stronger Union forces under [[Ambrose Burnside]] in the summer of 1863 forced Buckner to evacuate Knoxville before the earthworks were completed.<ref>Kim, ''The Sevierville Hill Site'', 10.</ref>

Burnside arrived in early September 1863, beginning the [[Knoxville campaign]]. Like the Confederates, he immediately began fortifying the city. The Union forces rebuilt Fort Loudon and erected 12 other forts and batteries flanked by entrenchments around the city. Burnside moved a pontoon bridge upstream from [[Loudon, Tennessee|Loudon]], allowing Union forces to cross the river and to build a series of forts along the heights of south Knoxville, including Fort Stanley and Fort Dickerson.<ref>Kim, ''The Sevierville Hill Site'', 10-12.</ref>

As Burnside was fortifying Knoxville, a Confederate army under [[Braxton Bragg]] defeated Union forces under [[William Rosecrans]] at the [[Battle of Chickamauga]] (near the Tennessee-Georgia line) and laid siege to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]]. On November 3, 1863, the Confederates sent General [[James Longstreet]] to attack Burnside at Knoxville and prevent him from reinforcing the Union at Chattanooga. Longstreet wanted to attack the city from the south, but lacking the necessary pontoon bridges he was forced to cross the river further downstream at Loudon on November 14 and march against the city's heavily fortified western section. On November 15, General [[Joseph Wheeler]] unsuccessfully attempted to dislodge Union forces in the heights of south Knoxville, and the following day Longstreet failed to cut off retreating Union forces at the [[Battle of Campbell's Station]] (now [[Farragut, Tennessee|Farragut]]).

On November 18, Union General [[William P. Sanders]] was mortally wounded while conducting delaying maneuvers west of Knoxville, and Fort Loudon was renamed Fort Sanders in his honor. On November 29, following a [[Siege of Knoxville|two-week siege]], the Confederates [[Battle of Fort Sanders|attacked Fort Sanders]] but failed after a fierce 20-minute engagement. On December 4, after word of the Confederate [[Chattanooga campaign|defeat at Chattanooga]] reached Longstreet, he broke his siege of Knoxville.<ref>Kim, ''The Sevierville Hill Site'', 15-17.</ref> The Union victories in the Knoxville campaign and at Chattanooga put much of East Tennessee under Union control for the rest of the war.

===Reconstruction and the Industrial Age===

After the war, northern investors such as brothers Joseph and David Richards helped Knoxville recover relatively quickly. The Richards brothers convinced 104 Welsh immigrant families to migrate from the [[Welsh Tract]] in [[Pennsylvania]] to work in a rolling mill. These Welsh families settled in an area now known as [[Mechanicsville, Knoxville|Mechanicsville]].<ref name=atkin>[http://caloncymreig.tnhillbillie.net/content/view/89/32/ The Old Atkin Street Church and Knoxville's Welsh Community] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130413204148/http://caloncymreig.tnhillbillie.net/content/view/89/32/ |date=April 13, 2013 }}.

In 1869, Thomas Humes, a Union sympathizer and president of East Tennessee University, secured federal post-war damage reimbursement and state-designated [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Act]] funding to expand the college, which had been occupied by both armies during the war. [[Charles William Dabney|Charles Dabney]], who became president of the university in 1887, overhauled the faculty and established a law school in an attempt to modernize the scope of the university.

The post-war manufacturing boom brought thousands of immigrants to the city. The population of Knoxville grew from around 5,000 in 1860 to 32,637 in 1900.

Knoxville hosted the Appalachian Exposition in 1910 and 1911 and the [[National Conservation Exposition]] in 1913. The latter is sometimes credited with giving rise to the movement to create a [[national park]] in the Great Smoky Mountains, some {{convert|20|mi}} south of Knoxville.<ref name="Jack Neely 2006">Jack Neely, "Knoxville, Tennessee".

Knoxville's reliance on a manufacturing economy left it particularly vulnerable to the effects of the [[Great Depression]]. The Tennessee Valley also suffered from frequent flooding, and millions of acres of farmland had been ruined by soil erosion. To control flooding and improve the economy in the Tennessee Valley, the federal government created the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) in 1933. Beginning with [[Norris Dam]], TVA constructed a series of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dams]] and other power plants throughout the valley over the next few decades, bringing flood control, jobs, and electricity to the region.<ref name=wheelertva>W.

In 1947, [[John Gunther]] dubbed Knoxville the "ugliest city" in America in his best-selling book ''[[Inside U.S.A. (book)|Inside U.S.A.]]'' Gunther's description jolted the city into enacting a series of beautification measures that helped improve the appearance of the downtown area.<ref name="Jack Neely 2006"/>

Knoxville's textile and manufacturing industries largely fell victim to foreign competition in the 1950s and 1960s, and after the establishment of the [[Interstate Highway System]] in the 1960s, the railroad—which had been largely responsible for Knoxville's industrial growth—began to decline. The rise of suburban shopping malls in the 1970s drew retail revenues away from Knoxville's downtown area. While government jobs and economic diversification prevented widespread unemployment in Knoxville, the city sought to recover the massive loss of revenue by attempting to annex neighboring communities. Knoxville annexed the communities of [[Bearden, Knoxville|Bearden]] and [[Fountain City, Knoxville|Fountain City]], which were Knoxville's largest [[suburb]]s, in 1962.<ref name="big180">{{cite web |last=Neely |first=Jack |title=THE BIG 1-8-0 |url=https://knoxvillehistoryproject.org/the-big-1-8-0/ |website=The Knoxville History Project |access-date=February 22, 2021}}</ref> Knoxville officials attempted the annexation of the neighboring [[Farragut, Tennessee|Farragut]]-[[Concord, Tennessee|Concord]] community in western Knox County, but the city failed following the [[Municipal corporation|incorporation]] of Farragut in 1980.<ref name="smith40">{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Wendy |title=Farragut at 40 |url=https://www.knoxtntoday.com/farragut-at-40/ |website=KnoxTNToday |access-date=February 22, 2021 |date=January 20, 2020}}</ref> These annexation attempts often turned combative, and several attempts to [[Consolidated city-county|consolidate]] Knoxville and Knox County into a metro government failed, while school boards and the planning commissions would merge on July 1, 1987.<ref name=wheeler/>

With further annexation attempts stalling, Knoxville initiated several projects aimed at boosting revenue in its downtown area.

During the 1980s and into the 1990s, the city would see one of its largest expansions of its city limits, with a reported 26 square miles of "[[shoestring annexation]]" under the administration of Mayor [[Victor Ashe]]. Ashe's efforts were controversial, largely consisting of annexation of interstate [[Right-of-way (property access)|right-of-ways]], highway-oriented commercial clusters, and residential subdivisions to increase tax revenue for the city.

Knoxville is situated in the [[Great Appalachian Valley]] (known locally as the Tennessee Valley), about halfway between the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] to the east and the [[Cumberland Plateau]] to the west. The Great Valley is part of a sub-range of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] known as the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]], which is characterized by long narrow ridges flanked by broad valleys. Prominent Ridge-and-Valley structures in the Knoxville area include Sharp's Ridge and Beaver Ridge in the northern part of the city, Brown Mountain in South Knoxville, parts of [[Bays Mountain]] just south of the city, and parts of McAnnally Ridge in the northeastern part of the city.

The [[Tennessee River]], which passes through the downtown area, is formed in southeastern Knoxville at the confluence of the [[Holston River]], which flows southwest from Virginia, and the [[French Broad River]], which flows west from North Carolina. The section of the Tennessee River that passes through Knoxville is part of Fort Loudoun Lake, an artificial reservoir created by TVA's [[Fort Loudoun Dam]] about {{convert|30|mi}} downstream in [[Lenoir City, Tennessee|Lenoir City]]. Notable tributaries of the Tennessee in Knoxville include First Creek and Second Creek, which flow through the downtown area, Third Creek, which flows west of U.T., and Sinking Creek, Ten Mile Creek, and Turkey Creek, which drain West Knoxville.

The downtown area contains a mixture of architectural styles from various periods, ranging from the hewn-log James White House (1786) to the modern [[Knoxville Museum of Art]] (1990). Styles represented include [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] ([[Old City Hall (Knoxville)|Old City Hall]]), [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] (Hotel St. Oliver and Sullivan's Saloon), [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] ([[Church Street Methodist Church (Knoxville, Tennessee)|Church Street Methodist Church]] and [[Ayres Hall]]), [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] (First Baptist Church), and [[Art Deco]] ([[United States Post Office and Courthouse (Knoxville, Tennessee)|Knoxville Post Office]]). Gay Street, Market Square, and Jackson Avenue contain numerous examples of late-19th and early-20th century commercial architecture.

Residential architecture tends to reflect the city's development over two centuries. [[William Blount Mansion]] (1791), in the oldest part of the city, is designed in a vernacular [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] style. "Streetcar suburbs" such as [[Fourth and Gill, Knoxville|Fourth and Gill]], [[Parkridge, Knoxville|Parkridge]], and [[Fort Sanders, Knoxville|Fort Sanders]], developed in the late 19th century with the advent of [[streetcar|trolleys]], tend to contain large concentrations of Victorian and [[bungalow]]/[[American Craftsman|Craftsman]]-style houses popular during this period. Early automobile suburbs, such as [[Lindbergh Forest]] and Sequoyah Hills, contain late-1920s and 1930s styles such as [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]], English Cottage, and [[Mission Revival architecture|Mission Revival]]. Neighborhoods developed after World War II typically consist of [[Ranch-style house]]s.

Knoxville is home to the nation's largest concentration of homes designed by noted Victorian residential architect [[George Franklin Barber]], who lived in the city.<ref>Knox Heritage, [http://www.knoxheritage.org/sites/default/files/KH%20George%20Barber%20Homes%20Tour_web.pdf George Barber Homes Trolley Tour Booklet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726233012/http://www.knoxheritage.org/sites/default/files/KH%20George%20Barber%20Homes%20Tour_web.pdf |date=July 26, 2011 }}, 2007. Retrieved: January 7, 2012.</ref> Other notable local architects include members of the [[Baumann family (architects)|Baumann family]], [[Charles I. Barber]] (son of George), [[R. F.
