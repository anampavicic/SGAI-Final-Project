==Etymology==
The name of Quảng Ninh province is the compound name of two former provinces: ''Quảng Yên'' and ''Hải Ninh'' according to the naming of President [[Ho Chi Minh]].

==Geography==
The province has the shape of an oblique rectangle inclined in a northeast-to-southwest direction. To the west, the province borders an extended forest and mountain region. To the east, it is adjacent to the [[Gulf of Tonkin|Gulf of Bắc Bộ]]. It features a meandering coastline, [[estuary|estuaries]] and tidal flats and more than 2,000 large and small islands. Exactly 1,030 of these have been named. Quảng Ninh's coordinates are longitude 106º25′ to 108º25′ east and latitude 20º40′ to 21º40′ north. Its width from east to west is 195&nbsp;km (at the widest part).<ref name=location/>
[[File:Cáp treo núi Yên Tử.jpg|thumb|left|Quảng Ninh's mountains and forestry, seen from the cable car network in the Yên Tử pagoda complex]]
The length from north to south of the province is 102&nbsp;km. The northernmost point is in a mountain range at Mo Toòng village (Hoành Mô Commune, Bình Liêu District). The southernmost point is in Hạ Mai Island (Ngọc Vừng Commune, Vân Đồn District). The westernmost point is in Vàng Chua River (Bình Dương and Nguyễn Huệ communes, Đông Triều District). The easternmost point is inland at Got Cape, northeast of Trà Cổ Commune, [[Móng Cái]] Town.<ref name=location/>

Quảng Ninh has a common international border with the People's Republic of China. Inland, north of province (Bình Liêu, Hải Hà districts) and [[Móng Cái]] borders [[Dongxing, Guangxi|Dongxing]] City and [[Fangcheng District|Fangcheng]] County in [[Guangxi]], [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] with the borderline of 170&nbsp;km. To the east, it adjuncts to Bắc Bộ Gulf. The province also borders [[Lạng Sơn Province|Lạng Sơn]], [[Bắc Giang Province|Bắc Giang]] and [[Hải Dương Province|Hải Dương]] provinces to the west, and the city of [[Hai Phong|Hải Phòng]] to the south. The coastal line is 250&nbsp;km. The total area of Quảng Ninh is 8,239.243&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, of which 5,938&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is mainland. The area of islands, bays and sea is a tremendous 2,448.853&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. The total area of the islands is 619.913&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=Geography/><ref name=location/>

===Topography===
Quảng Ninh is a mountainous and coastal province, with more than 80 per cent of its area being made up of mountains and hills. The 2,000 some islands are also considered mountains. The mountainous zone can be divided into two parts: the eastern mountainous region extending from [[Tiên Yên]] through [[Bình Liêu]], [[Hải Hà]], [[Đầm Hà]] and [[Móng Cái]]; and the western zone ranging from Tiên Yên through [[Ba Chẽ]] and [[Hoành Bồ]], north of [[Uông Bí Town]]. The former is a continuation of the [[Thâp Van Đai Son]] range in China. There are two main chains: [[Quảng Nam Châu]] 1,507 m and [[Cao Xiêm]] 1,330 m. The western zone features smooth and curved mountains called [[Đông Triều]] with [[Yên Tu Mount]] 1,068 m in [[Uông Bí]] region and [[Am Váp Mount]] 1,094 m in [[Hoành Bồ]] District.<ref name=location/><ref name=natural/>

The midland and coastal plains include a low range of hills weathered by both wind and water; forming fields and river basins. They include the zones of [[Đông Triêu]], [[Uông Bí]], northern [[Yên Hưng]], southern [[Tiên Yên]], [[Hải Hà]] and some of [[Móng Cái]]. In the estuaries, [[alluvium|alluvial]] soil is deposited, creating low tidal flats. This can be found in the areas of southern Uông Bí, southern Yên Hưng (Hà Nam Island), eastern Yên Hưng, Đông Rui (Tiên Yên), southern Đầm Hà and [[Mong Cai]], southeastern Hải Hà. The midlands and plains of the coastline are extremely favourable for agriculture and transport. It has become a densely populated area.<ref name=location/><ref name=natural/>

The sea and island zone of Quảng Ninh has a unique terrain. There are more than 2,000 islands, making up two-thirds of the country's islands. They extend along the coast for more than 250&nbsp;km and divide into numerous layers. The largest islands are Cái Bầu and Bản Sen, while the smallest are just like rocks in a garden. Vân Đồn and Cô Tô are island districts. There are thousands of islands on [[Hạ Long Bay]] and Bái Tử Long Bay, many of which contain caves. Besides areas of alluvial deposits, there are also white sand zones which have built up from tidal action. Some places have formed white sand mines producing materials for the glass industry (Van Hai), or have developed into tourism spots (Trà Cổ, Quan Lạn, Minh Châu, Ngọc Vừng).<ref name=location/><ref name=natural/>

The sea bottom terrain of Quảng Ninh isn't smooth, and has an average depth of 20 m. There are the remnants of ancient streams and underwater rocky banks. The streams from the mainland connect to deep drains along the sea-floor; creating a series of waterways, canals and harbours along the coast.<ref name=location/>

===Hydrography===
In Quảng Ninh, there are numerous rivers and springs, but most are short and small, and feature currents that differ between seasons. In winter, most rivers run dry; in summer, waterfalls pick up fast currents. The water current reaches 1.45 m<sup>3</sup>/s in dry season, but up to 1,500 m<sup>3</sup>/s in the rainy season. Quảng Ninh's sea borders upon the Gulf of Bắc Bộ. It is large and protected by the ranks of islands, so the wind is quieter and the water smoother. The gulf's current runs from north to south. It is Vietnam's coldest sea, with the temperature sometimes dipping below 13&nbsp;°C. The average tide level recorded is 2.5 m.<ref name=location/><ref name=natural/>

===Water resources===
[[File:Quan Lan Island, Vân Đồn District.jpg|thumb|left|[[Quan Lan Island]], [[Vân Đồn District]]]]

Water resources in the province of Quảng Ninh are abundant and distinct. The largest rivers are: the [[Ka Long]] (the natural national border between China and Vietnam), [[Hà Côi]], [[Đầm Hà]], [[Tiên Yên]], [[Phố Cũ]], [[Ba Chẽ]], [[Diễn Vọng]], [[Trới]], [[Míp]], [[Uông]], [[Đạm]] and [[Cầm]] rivers. The provincial border is the [[Kinh Thầy River]] which joins the Đá Bạch River and runs into Bạch Đằng. The total static capacity is estimated at 175.106 m<sup>3</sup> of water. Out of the 72 lakes and dams, there are 28 large lakes with a total of capacity of 195.53&nbsp;million m<sup>3</sup> of water. The largest is Yên Lập Lake, which blocks the Míp Estuary. Its water volume is 1.18&nbsp;million m<sup>3</sup>. Other lakes include: [[Khuất Động]], [[Trúc Bài Sơn]], [[Khe Táu]], [[Đoan Tĩnh]], [[Khe Uơn]], [[Khe Chếnh]], [[Yên Trung]], [[Bến Châu]], [[Trại Lốc]], [[Rộc Cả]] and [[An Biên]].<ref name=location/><ref name=natural/>

Underground running water is also abundant, and can even be found on some of the larger islands. According to prospective data, 13 urban and industrial areas make use of 64,388 m<sup>3</sup> water/day. In the province there are natural bottle water points in [[Quảng Hanh]] ([[Cẩm Phả]]), [[Khe Lạc]] ([[Tiên Yên]]) and [[Đồng Long]] ([[Bình Liêu]]). Mineral water is concentrated in the village of Quảng Hanh. Presently, there are 15 exploration holes, and according to preliminary results, capacity could be 1,004 m<sup>3</sup>/day. Quảng Hanh mineral water is clear and colourless, with mineral content varying from 3.5 to 5.05 g/L.<ref name=location/><ref name=natural/>

===Mineral resources===
The province has rich natural mineral resources of coal, [[limestone]], clay, [[Kaolinite|kaolin]], white sand, [[granite]] and so forth. Large reserves of [[anthracite]] coal account for 90 per cent of coal output of Vietnam. Limestone reserves are estimated at 3.1&nbsp;billion tonnes which would be the basic input for cement manufacture. Other mineral resources [[phosphorus]], titanium, [[antimony]], quartz, and oil have been found which could auger more industrial projects in the Province. Clay and glassy sand, important material inputs in the building industry for manufacture of tiles, bricks, and ceramics are in abundance.<ref name=natural/>

===Climate===
[[File:Ha Long sunset.jpg|thumb|Hạ Long at [[sunset]]]]

Quảng Ninh's climate is symbolic of the climate of North Vietnam; featuring all four seasons. In summer, it is hot, humid and rainy, while [[monsoons]] flourish. The average annual temperature recorded is 22.9&nbsp;°C. In winter, it is cold (between 1 and 3&nbsp;°C), dry, and sees little rainfall (between 150&nbsp;mm and 400&nbsp;mm). The average humidity is 82 percent. Annual average rainfall, influenced by north-eastern monsoons, varies between 1,700&nbsp;mm and 2,400&nbsp;mm (maximum recorded is 2751&nbsp;mm), with rainfall concentrated in the summer months for 90 to 170 days, particularly in July and August.<ref name=location/><ref name=natural/>

In comparison to other provinces in the north, Quảng Ninh has been more under the influences of north-eastern monsoon. The wind blows strongly and the temperature drops to between 1 and. During the north-east monsoon, high mountainous regions such as Bình Liêu and Hải Hà, Đầm Hà experiences temperatures below 0&nbsp;°C. Storms have a large influence on the province, mainly in June, July and August. The intensity can be extremely strong, especially in island and coastal regions.<ref name=location/><ref name=natural/>

Because of the terrain differences, the climates of sub-regions differ. The border area of the Móng Cái District is colder and rainy, with an average temperature of around 22&nbsp;°C and rainfall reaching 2,751&nbsp;mm. In the Yên Hưng District, the most southern area, the average temperature is 24&nbsp;°C and gets an average rainfall of 1,700&nbsp;mm. The high mountainous region of Hoành Bồ, and Ba Chẽ districts, has 20 days of frost a year, and is subject to little rainfall. In the Bình Liêu District there is heavy rain (2,400&nbsp;mm) and winter lasts for six months. The offshore island region is not the wettest area, with only 1,700 to 1,800&nbsp;mm of rainfall per year, but winter is often accompanied by thick mists.<ref name=location/><ref name=natural/>

==Fauna and flora==
Quảng Ninh features a diversified and abundant environmental system, thanks to its varied terrain, climate and soil. The province thus has a rich biodiversity of flora and fauna. Identified floral species are numbered at 1,027 of 6 phyla, while faunal species are 120.<ref name=natural/>

===Fauna===
There are the regular domestic animals: cattle, pigs, poultry, cats, dogs, and rabbits. Cattle breeding has developed well in the mountainous regions, while the Móng Cái pig is now famous for its especially lean meat. In eastern districts, swans [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridized]] with ducks, called ''cà sáy'' by locals, are also becoming popular. Numerous foreign cattle are imported as well: [[domestic buffalo|buffaloes]] from India, milk cows from the Netherlands and India and horses, sheep and goats from [[Mongolia]].

===Wild animals===
Formerly, as with the rest of Vietnam, there were once numerous wild animals. In more remote times, there were elephants, [[rhinoceros]], tigers, [[leopard]]s and bears roaming the area. Today, there are monkeys, [[deer]], [[pheasant]]s, [[eagle]]s, wild [[boar]]s, various birds and [[tortoise]]s (which unfortunately are less abundant than they once were).

===Aquatic fauna===
In Quảng Ninh aquatic fauna is very abundant, both fresh and sea water. There are large species of fish in the Gulf of Bắc Bộ. In addition, there are special species such as [[pearl mussels]], [[stockfish]], [[sea turtle]]s and [[lobster]]s, while along the coastline, [[oyster]]s and edible [[seaweed]] abound. These numerous fish resources of the sea have always been an important source of income for the residents of Quảng Ninh.<ref name=natural/>

===Flora===
Quảng Ninh's floral strong point has always been forestry. Agricultural land is narrow and unfertilized, so the production of rice, maize and [[sweet potatoes]] is poor. Making up for this is high productivity from fruit trees, lumber trees and industrial plants.<ref name=natural/>

The area for fruit trees in the Đông Triều District totals around 30&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Formerly in Quảng Ninh, there was diverse and high-quality wood available, in particular ironwood and [[teak]] trees. Presently, there are mainly pine trees. In mountainous areas, there are a variety of trees and plants, providing spices and traditional medicines.<ref name=natural/>
