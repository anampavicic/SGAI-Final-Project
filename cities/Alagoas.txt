'''Alagoas''' ({{IPA|pt-BR|alaˈɡoɐs|lang|Pt-br Alagoas.ogg}}), officially '''State of Alagoas''', is one of the 27 [[federative units of Brazil]] and is situated in the eastern part of the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Region]]. It borders: [[Pernambuco]] (N and NW); [[Sergipe]] (S); [[Bahia]] (SW); and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] (E). Its capital is the city of [[Maceió]]. It has 1.6% of the Brazilian population and produces 0.8% of the Brazilian [[GDP]]. It is made up of 102 [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipalities]] and its most populous cities are Maceió, [[Arapiraca]], [[Palmeira dos Índios]], [[Rio Largo]], [[Penedo]], [[União dos Palmares]], [[São Miguel dos Campos]], [[Santana do Ipanema]], [[Delmiro Gouveia]], [[Coruripe]], and [[Campo Alegre, Alagoas|Campo Alegre]].

It is the second smallest Brazilian state in area (larger only than Sergipe) and it is [[List of Brazilian states by population|16th in population]]. It is also one of the largest producers of [[sugarcane]], [[coconut]]s, and [[natural gas]] in the country. Alagoas also has oil exploration, mostly of onshore deposits.

Land of the ''[[Mytella charruana|sururu]]'' (or Charru Mussel), lagoon shellfish which serves as food for the coastal population, and of coconut water, Alagoas also possesses some of the country's richest [[folklore]].

Initially, the territory of Alagoas constituted the southern part of the [[Captaincy of Pernambuco]] and only gained its autonomy in 1817. Its occupation pushed the expansion of the [[Captaincy|captaincy's]] sugarcane farming, which required new areas of cultivation, southward. Thus arose [[Porto Calvo]], Alagoas (now Marechal Deodoro) and [[Penedo]], nuclei which guided the colonization, economic, and social life of the region for a long time.

The [[Dutch Brazil|Dutch invasion]] in Pernambuco was extended to Alagoas in 1631. The invaders were expelled in 1645, after intense fighting in Porto Calvo, leaving the economy in ruins.

The escape of [[Slavery in Brazil|African slaves]] during the Dutch invasion created a serious labour shortage problem on the [[Engenho|sugarcane plantations]]. Grouped in villages called [[quilombo]]s, the Africans were only completely dominated at the end of the 17th century with the destruction of the most important quilombo, [[Palmares (quilombo)|Palmares]].

During the [[Empire of Brazil|empire]], the separatist and republican [[Confederation of the Equator]] received the support of noteworthy figures from Alagoas. Throughout the 1840s, political life was marked by the conflict between the ''lisos'' (lit. "straights", not the sexual orientation connotation), [[Conservative Party (Brazil)|conservatives]], and the ''cabeludos'' (lit. "hairies"), [[Liberal Party (Brazil, 1831)|liberals]].

At the beginning of the 20th century, the region's hinterland lived through the pioneering experience of Delmiro Gouveia, an entrepreneur from Pernambuco who installed the Estrela thread factory, which came to produce 200 spools daily. Delmiro Gouveia was killed in October 1917 in circumstances still unclarified, after being pressured, according to rumor, to sell his factory to competing foreign firms. After his death, his machines would be destroyed and thrown into [[Paulo Afonso Falls]].

Nicknamed the ''Land of the Marshals'' (''Terra dos Marechais''), for being the birthplace of [[Deodoro da Fonseca]] and [[Floriano Peixoto]], the first two [[President of Brazil|presidents of Brazil]], Alagoas gave the country numerous illustrious Brazilians among whom are the anthropologist Arthur Ramos, the maestro Hekel Tavares, the philologist [[Aurélio Buarque de Holanda Ferreira|Aurélio Buarque de Holanda]], the musicians [[Djavan]] and [[Hermeto Pascoal]] the poet [[Jorge de Lima]], the jurists [[Pontes de Miranda]] and Marcos Bernardes de Mello, besides the writers [[Lêdo Ivo]] and [[Graciliano Ramos]].

==Geography==

[[Image:Maceio Alagoas Brasil.PNG|thumb|left|Summer in [[Maceió]].]]
The state's name originates with the lakes along its coast near the city of Maceió. The coast is bordered by fringing reefs and many fine beaches. Behind the beaches, sometimes only hundreds of meters and defined by steep scarps, lies a stretch of green coastal hills having enough rainfall for considerable agriculture and scarce remnants of the [[Atlantic Forest]] that now is largely limited to steep hill tops or steep valley sides and bottoms. This is the area long dominated by sugar cane.

Still farther inland lies the Sertão of the Northeast region of the nation. The Sertão is a high dry region dominated by scrub that is often thorn-filled and sometimes toxic, the [[caatinga]]. This area and its people are famed in legend and song. It is the land of the cowboy who is clad from head to toe (if he is lucky) with very thick leather to avoid the sharp vegetation.

==History==
{{Main|History of Alagoas}}
[[Image:Museu de arte sacra do convento de Santa Maria (Marechal Deodoro, AL).jpg|thumb|right|Convent of Santa Maria, [[Marechal Deodoro, Alagoas|Marechal Deodoro]].]]
During the first three centuries of its history, Alagoas was part of the captaincy of Pernambuco, only becoming an independent captaincy in 1817.  As a reprisal against the [[Pernambucan revolt|Pernambuco Revolution]], the King [[João VI|John VI]] of [[Portugal]] ordered a vast portion of the territory of Pernambuco to be taken from it, most including its southern portion, one part was given to the captaincy of [[Bahia]], the other portion was made independent, creating Alagoas as a new Brazilian captaincy.

Initially, in the first years of the 16th century, Alagoas settlement went on slowly, however helped by Africans turned into slaves whose work urged the local economy. In the period of the 16th and 17th centuries, French pirates invaded its territory attracted by the commerce of [[Paubrasilia|brazilwood]].

Some time later, [[Duarte Coelho]], owner of the captaincy of Pernambuco, gave the control of the region back to the Portuguese, running the territory as part of his captaincy. He increased the number of sugar cane plantations and built some sugar mills, as well as founding the cities of Penedo and [[Marechal Deodoro, Alagoas|Alagoas]] – this last one originally baptized by Portuguese as Santa Maria Madalena da Alagoa do Sul (Saint Mary Magdalene of the Southern Lake), currently the historic heritage town of Deodoro da Fonseca.

In 1570, a second expedition ordered by Duarte Coelho and led by [[Cristóvão Lins]], explored the north of Alagoas and founded the settlement of Porto Calvo and five sugar mills, which two of them still endure, Buenos Aires and Escurial.

In 1630, the territory was taken by the Dutch, whose interest was to manage the commerce of sugarcane in most parts of the northeastern region of Brazil. As part of one of the wealthiest Brazilian captaincies, Alagoas prospered along with the [[sugar trade]]. They built ''Fort Maurits'' in Penedo, on the river São Francisco. However, the Dutch colonizers abandoned the territory after being defeated in 1646.

Decades before Alagoas was formed in 1817, its [[sugar industry]] had 200 mills, and agriculture also involved cotton, tobacco and corn plantations. With [[Independence of Brazil|Brazilian independence]] from Portugal in 1822, Alagoas became a [[Province of Alagoas|province]]. In 1839, the capital of the province was changed definitively from [[Marechal Deodoro, Alagoas|the town of Alagoas]] to Maceió, mainly due to the increasing growth of the city because of its port.

[[File:Cana-energia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sugarcane]] seedlings in the interior of the state]]

Alagoas is one of the poorest states of Brazil. It has the second worst HDI in the country, ahead only of the state of [[Maranhão]], though its indicators have improved in recent years.<ref name="economist.com"/><ref>{{Cite web |title=Subnational HDI (v7.0) |url=https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/shdi/ |access-date=19 May 2023 |website=Global Data Lab}}</ref> The [[service sector]] is the largest component of [[GDP]] at 55.8%, followed by the [[industrial sector]] at 36.9%. [[Agriculture]] represents 7.3% of the state's [[GDP]] (2004). Alagoas exports consist of: [[sugar]] 58.8%, [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] 29.4%, [[chemicals]] 9%, [[tobacco]] 2.1% (2002).

The economy has been [[agriculture|agricultural]], dependent largely on large sugarcane plantations with some [[tobacco]] farming that is concentrated around the city of Arapiraca. Sugar cane formed the basis for an [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] industry that is in decline. Small to medium-sized tanker ships took alcohol on board in Maceio's port with considerable frequency during the peak period. Such loads still take place with less frequency. Another local industry is based on chemical products from [[brine]] pumped from deep wells on the outskirts of Maceió.

In the last twenty years the [[tourism|tourist]] industry has found the beaches and Maceió itself has changed from a rather sleepy little port with coconut palm plantations along its beaches to high-rise hotels. The northern coast, particularly around the towns Maragogi and Japaratinga is beginning to see some of this development in the form of resorts attracting people from the south and from [[Europe]]. There is considerable European investment (as of 2007) in beach property north of Maceió with walled compounds of beach homes.

== Infrastructure ==

===International Airport===
Alagoas gained a new airport complex, [[Zumbi dos Palmares International Airport]], in the Maceió Metropolitan Area, designed by homegrown architect Mário Aloísio, which combines glass, metal and granite. It includes space for art exhibitions, a panoramic deck, chapel, seven escalators, nine elevators and four boarding bridges. The whole terminal was designed to permit access by the physically disabled, with ramps and special bathroom fixtures.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

In the new terminal, [[Infraero]] also brings to Maceió "Aeroshopping" – a concept that is transforming the country's airports into centers for leisure and high-quality products and services. The entire building has a computerized air conditioning, with commercial spaces that will be occupied gradually. The parking area was more than tripled. Demand will be able to grow to 1.2 million passengers a year since the new passenger terminal has 24,000 square meters, the triple of its former size. The check-in counters were doubled and can reach higher numbers without any structural remodeling. The building is "intelligent", meaning controlled by a computerized system that regulates factors ranging from the lighting level to air temperature and even the speed of the escalators. This system also controls access to restricted areas and the fire protection system, among others.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

===Port===
The Port of Jaraguá is located in Maceió. The commercial and economic development of the Port of Jaraguá, on the margins of the Mundaú lagoon, was responsible for the emergence of an important settlement that received the name of Maceió and later became the present capital of Alagoas. The Port of Jaraguá is situated in a natural port area that facilitates the ships docking. During the colonial period, the most important products exported through the port were sugar, tobacco, coconut and spices.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

==Sports==

Maceió was one of the 18 candidates to host games of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], for which Brazil was the selected host, but it did not make the final cut.
