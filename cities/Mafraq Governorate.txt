'''Mafraq''' ({{langx|ar|محافظة المفرق}} ''Muhāfaẓat al-Mafraq'', local dialects ''Mafrag'' or ''Mafra' '') is one of the governorates of [[Jordan]], located to the north-east of [[Amman]], capital of Jordan. It has a population of 637,000 (2021 estimate)<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jordan: Governorates, Major Cities & Urban Localities - Population Statistics, Maps, Charts, Weather and Web Information |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/jordan/cities/ |access-date=2024-02-23 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dos.gov.jo/home_e.htm |title=DOS Jordan |access-date=2011-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304001541/http://www.dos.gov.jo/home_e.htm |archive-date=2011-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> making up 5.8% of Jordan's population. Its capital is [[Mafraq]], which is known for its military bases.

==History==
[[File:بلدية الخالدية.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The city hall of the town of Khalediyya]]
[[Image:Mafraq nahias.png|thumb|right|250px|Nahiyahs of Mafraq]]
Many Roman and Byzantine sites have been found throughout the governorate, most notably churches dating to the third century AD;  believed to be two of the oldest purpose built churches in Christianity: and Roman water dams in [[Jawa Dam (Jordan)|Jawa]], [[Ruwaished]], and the city of Mafraq.  The [[Jawa Dam (Jordan)|Jawa Dam]] is the oldest known dam in the world, dating back to 3000 B.C. Mafraq city also contains a Roman fort.

During the British mandate period, Mafraq housed military facilities which are still in use today. The fifth division of the [[Jordanian Army]] is stationed in Mafraq.

==Geography==
The province is located in the eastern part of the kingdom of Jordan. It is the only governorate in Jordan that has borders with three countries: [[Iraq]] to the east, [[Syria]] to the north, and [[Saudi Arabia]] to the south. It is bordered by [[Irbid Governorate|Irbid]] and [[Jerash Governorate|Jerash]] governorates to the west, and by [[Zarqa Governorate|Zarqa governorate]] to the south.

Mafraq governorate covers the second largest area in the kingdom, but yet the second smallest population density (after Ma'an). The climate is dry most of the year. The western region of the province is part of the fertile [[Houran]] plateaus, that extend through southern Syria, the Golan heights and northern Jordan. The eastern region is part of the barren [[Syrian Desert]]. At the eastern edge of the region is the 940m high {{ill-WD|Jebel 'Aneiza|ar|عنزة (جبل)}} (or 'Unayzah), at the border [[tripoint]] between Jordan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia.<ref name=wagner>{{cite book|last1=Wagner|first1=Wolfgang|title=Groundwater in the Arab Middle East|date=2011|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9783642193514|page=141|access-date=2 February 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0dFttVkr2uwC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Jebel 'Aneiza, Saudi Arabia|url=http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-4361447&fid=5593&c=saudi_arabia|website=geographic.org|access-date=2 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Philip's world atlas.|date=2003|publisher=George Philip|location=London|isbn=0540084085|pages=44|edition=New}}</ref>
