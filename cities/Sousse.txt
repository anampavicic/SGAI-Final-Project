==Toponymy==
''Sousse'' and ''Soussa'' are both French spellings of the [[Arabic]] name ''Sūsa''. The present city has also grown to include the ruins of '''[[Hadrumetum]]''', which had [[Hadrumetum#Names|many names]] in several languages during [[classical antiquity|antiquity]].<ref name=Sousse-Barrington>Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World, Gazeteer, page 511, Map 33 Theveste-Hadrumetum, Compiled by R.B.

The city featured in the [[Third Sicilian War]], the [[Second Punic War|Second]] and [[Third Punic War]]s (in the latter of which it secured additional territory and special privileges by aiding [[Roman Republic|Rome]] against what was left of the Carthaginians), and [[Caesar's Civil War]], when it was the scene of Caesar's famously deft recovery: upon tripping while coming ashore, he dealt with the poor [[omen]] this threatened to become by grabbing handfuls of dirt and proclaiming "I have you now, Africa!"

Its native sons included the jurist [[Salvius Julianus]], the emperor [[Clodius Albinus]], and numerous [[Early Christianity|Christian]] [[Christian saint|saints]]. The Roman and Byzantine [[catacombs]] beneath the city are extensive.

The [[Vandals]] sacked Hadrumetum in 434 but it remained a place of importance within [[Vandal Kingdom|their kingdom]]; [[Felix of Hadrumetum|a bishop]] and [[Victorian, Frumentius and Companions|proconsul]] were martyred there during the Vandals' periodic [[forced conversion]]s of their subjects to [[Arianism]]. The [[Byzantine Empire]] reconquered the town in 534 during the [[Vandalic War|Vandal War]] and engaged in a public works program that included new fortifications and churches. The town was sacked during the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]'s 7th-century [[Islamic conquest of the Maghreb|conquest of North Africa]]. According to a 1987 [[ICOMOS]] report, [[Uqba ibn Nafi]]'s siege and capture of the city resulted in its almost complete destruction, such that no monument of Hadrumetum "subsists in situ".<ref name=Sousse-ICOMOS/>

===Medieval Susa===
Muslim Arab armies rapidly spread [[Arab culture]] across what had been a thoroughly Romanized and Christianized landscape. Under the [[Aghlabids]], Susa was established near the ruins of Hadrumetum and served as their main port. Their [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|827 invasion of Sicily]] was mainly launched from the town's harbor. After the Byzantine city of [[Melite (ancient city)|Melite]] (modern [[Mdina]] on [[Malta]]) was [[Siege of Melite (870)|captured by the Aghlabids in 870]], [[marble]] from its churches was used to build the [[Ribat of Sousse|Ribat]].<ref name=al-himayri>{{cite web |last1=Brincat |first1=Joseph M. |title=New Light on the Darkest Age in Malta's History |url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/The%20Arabs%20in%20Malta/1995proc%20Malta%20870-1054%20by%20J.M.%20Brincat.pdf |website=melitensiawth.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304095600/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/The%20Arabs%20in%20Malta/1995proc%20Malta%20870-1054%20by%20J.M.%20Brincat.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A soaring structure that combined the purposes of a minaret and a watch tower, it remains in outstanding condition and draws visitors from around the world. [[Great Mosque of Sousse|Its mosque]] is sometimes accounted the oldest surviving in the region and the town's main mosque, also built during the 9th century, has a similarly fortress-like appearance.

Susa was briefly occupied by [[Kingdom of Sicily|Norman Sicily]] in the 12th century; it fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 16th; and it was bombarded by a [[Kingdom of France|French]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] fleet in the 18th.

Medieval Susa was known for its textile industries, producing silk and [[flax]] fabrics called ''Sūsī''. Especially renowned were its robes called {{transliteration|ar|shuqqas}}, some of which were mass-produced and sold [[ready-to-wear]] throughout the Mediterranean.<ref name="Mediterranean Society">{{cite book |last1=Goitein |first1=Shelomo Dov |last2=Sanders |first2=Paula |title=A Mediterranean Society: Daily life |date=1967 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0520048695 |pages=180, 402 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UzOvJHFTTeUC |access-date=22 June 2020}}</ref>

After the decline of [[Mahdia]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, Susa remained as the most important town in the Sahel region, with a population of about 15,000.<ref name="Jedidi 1997"/>

===Colonial Sousse===
[[File:The Tunisian Port of Sousse After Allied Bombing, 4 June 1943 TR1007.jpg|thumb|Damage to the port of Sousse after an Allied bombing raid, June 1943]]
Tunisia became a [[French Tunisia|French protectorate]] in 1881. Around the end of the 19th century, Sousse had a population of 7,000 and was the second-most-important city in Tunisia after Tunis itself.<ref name="Jedidi 1997"/> At this point, the entire population of Sousse lived in the walled ''medina''.<ref name="Jedidi 1997"/> The medina was surrounded by agricultural settlements, two of which - [[Kala Kebira]] and [[Msaken]] - were more densely populated than the city itself.<ref name="Jedidi 1997"/> The French Protectorate reinforced Sousse's role as a commercial and administrative center by establishing public buildings, enlarging the city's port, and building railways.<ref name="Jedidi 1997"/> Between 1896 and 1911, railways were built connecting Sousse with Tunis, Kairouan, Sfax, Mahdia, [[Moknin]], and [[Henshir Suwatir]].<ref name="Jedidi 1997"/> Food industries were also established in the city.<ref name="Jedidi 1997"/>

Before the [[First World War]], Sousse had about 25,000 inhabitants, including around 10,000 French and roughly 5,000 other Europeans, mostly Italians and Maltese. The port was the garrison of the 4th Tunisian Rifle Regiment.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}

The first developments outside the ''medina'' walls were begun during this period, but they were home to a relatively small number of people until after the [[Second World War]].<ref name="Jedidi 1997"/> Sousse was devastated by the war and suffered 39 bombardments between December 1942 and May 1943.<ref name="Jedidi 1997"/> In 1946, after the war was over, the authorities decided to give a high priority to reconstruction efforts in Sousse.<ref name="Jedidi 1997"/>

===Modern Sousse===
When Tunisia became independent in 1956, Sousse was made a ''wileya'' capital and it continued to expand in all directions.<ref name="Jedidi 1997"/> Over the course of the 20th century, its growth was explosive: from just 8,577 residents in 1885, it had grown to 134,835 residents in 1994.<ref name="Jedidi 1997"/> Its physical area had also increased massively, from a compact 29 [[hectare]]s in 1881 to 3,100 hectares in 1992.<ref name="Jedidi 1997"/> The [[secondary sector|secondary]] and [[tertiary sector|tertiary]] sectors of the economy also grew accordingly.<ref name="Jedidi 1997"/>

Sousse has retained the Arabian look and feel it assumed in the centuries after its initial conquest. Today it is considered one of the best examples of seaward-facing fortifications built by the Arabs. With a population of about 200,000, Sousse retains a medieval heart of narrow, twisted streets, a [[kasbah]] and [[medina quarter|medina]], its ''ribat'' fortress and long wall on the [[Mediterranean]]. Surrounding it is a modern city of long, straight roads and more widely spaced buildings.

Sousse was the site of the [[interzonal|chess interzonal]] in 1967, made famous when American [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] [[Bobby Fischer]] withdrew from the tournament even though he was in first place at the time.<ref>[https://archive.today/20121203000714/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1080581/index.htm The Further Adventures Of Terrible-tempered Bobby]</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Tunezja,panorama Sousse - panoramio.jpg|thumb|250px|Sousse industrial zone]]

Sousse's most important economic activity takes place in the [[tertiary sector]], which employs over 50% of the city's workforce and includes administration, education, healthcare, trade, communications, and banking.<ref name="Jedidi 1997"/> Not far behind is the [[secondary sector]], which employs another 45% of the city's workers and includes industries like textiles and leather, construction, chemicals, electronics, and mechanical and electrical components.<ref name="Jedidi 1997"/> The small remainder is engaged in the [[primary sector]], mainly fishing.<ref name="Jedidi 1997"/> Although smaller than the port in Sfax, Sousse has a port that serves an important commercial outlet for central Tunisia, particularly for the regions around Kairouan and Kasserine.<ref name="Jedidi 1997"/>

Sousse is the third largest city in Tunisia after [[Tunis]] and [[Sfax]]. Although it is associated with [[olive oil]] manufacture and has other industries, tourism predominates today. An [[olive]] grove covering more than {{convert|2500|km2|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} constitutes one of its main riches since [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]. The busy port near downtown adds a touch of liveliness to its activity. Sousse also had many [[oil well]]s in the area during its colonial period.

===Tourism===
Sousse is an important tourist resort. It has a [[hot semi-arid climate]], with the seaside location moderating the climate, making it an all-season resort with hot, dry summers and warm, mild, wet winters. The fine sandy beaches are backed by [[orchards]] and [[olive]] groves.

Only {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Monastir, Tunisia|Monastir]] and [[Monastir Habib Bourguiba International Airport]], hotel complexes with a capacity of 40,000 beds extend {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} from the old city ([[Medina quarter|medina]]) north along the seafront to [[Port El Kantaoui]]. Some 1,200,000 visitors come every year to enjoy its hotels and restaurants, nightclubs, casinos, beaches, and sports facilities.

Sousse is considered a popular tourist destination, especially due to its nightlife. Well-known nightclubs include Bora Bora, Living, Rediguana, Platinum, and The Saloon. The top producers and DJs in dance come to play at the various clubs. The season traditionally begins at the start of June and finishes on the first weekend of October with the closing parties.

==Transport==
[[File:Train electrique, SNCFT, Sousse 2012.JPG|thumb|left|[[Sahel Metro]] train in Sousse]]
[[File:Sousse Bab Jedid train station.JPG|thumb|right|Sousse-Bab Jedid station.]]
Sousse is well-connected with the main [[Tunisian Railways]] network, having non-electrified lines to [[Tunis]] (since 1899), [[Sfax]] (since 1911), and [[Kasserine]] (since 2004) with [[diesel multiple unit]] and [[locomotive]]-driven trains. The main [[Gare Sousse]] terminus is in the city center, while Gare [[Kalaa Seghira]] serves a bypass route.

Since 2010 the electrified [[Sahel Metro]] line goes south to [[Monastir Habib Bourguiba International Airport]], [[Monastir, Tunisia|Monastir]], and [[Mahdia]]. This line has the [[Sousse - Bab Jadid]] station as its northern terminus in Sousse's city center, and 4 additional stations in the city.

Intercity buses and red-strip microbuses (so-called ''[[louage]]s'') connect Sousse with many cities in Tunisia. Urban transit in Sousse is served by routes of articulated and conventional buses, blue-strip louages, and cheap taxis. The {{track gauge|600 mm}} [[Sousse–Kairouan Decauville railway]] operated from 1882 to 1996, before it was regauged to {{track gauge|1000 mm}} gauge.

==Sights==
=== Medina ===
{{see also|Medina of Sousse, Tunisia}}
[[File:Medina of Sousse-130327.jpg|thumb|Medina of Sousse]]
A [[medina quarter|medina]], surrounded by its city walls and fortifications, is of historical interest. The medina includes open and covered bazaars (souks). Buildings of historical interest include the ''ribat'' castle, the central mosque, and a historical museum in the [[Casbah]] with mosaics from the area's many Roman villas. The [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] [[catacombs]] can be visited.

[[UNESCO]] declared the [[Medina quarter|medina]] of Sousse a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1988, citing among various things its preservation from modern development.

=== Port Kantaoui ===
{{see also|Port El Kantaoui}}
The Kantaoui Port, is a touristic station in the form of a Port. It was built in 1979 specifically as a tourist center.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.planetware.com/sousse/port-el-kantaoui-tun-so-spek.htm | title=Port El Kantaoui, Tunisia | work = PlanetWare – Your Unlimited Travel Guide to the World | access-date=20 March 2006}}</ref>

The architecture, although modern and dazzlingly white, has been modeled on the more traditional buildings in Tunisia, complete with narrow streets and arches. The hotels that line the beachfront extend from Sousse itself along miles of sparkling clean sea to the harbor of Port El Kantaoui and to the north of the harbor.

Located at the entrance to the medina, it was erected by the Aghlabid sovereign Aboul Abbas I (841–856) in 850–851, almost thirty years after the construction of the Ribat of Sousse. This mosque is the most emblematic of a city that became a few years after the reign of Ziadet-Allah I (817–838), the second city of Ifriqiya and the Sahel. Subsequently, the building is enlarged during the reign of Ibrahim II (875–902).
