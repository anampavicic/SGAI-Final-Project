{{Contains special characters|Sundanese}}
'''Tangerang''' ([[Sundanese script|Sundanese]]: {{Sund|ᮒᮍᮨᮛᮀ}}, {{IPA|id|taˈŋəɾaŋ}}) is the [[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|city]] with the largest population in the province of [[Banten]], [[Indonesia]]. Located on the western border of [[Jakarta]], it is the sixth largest [[city proper]] in the nation (excluding Jakarta, which is classed as a province containing five [[administrative city|administrative cities]] and one [[regency]]). It has an area of {{cvt|164.55|km2|sqmi|2|abbr=off}} and an official 2010 Census population of 1,798,601,<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> which had risen to 1,895,486 at the 2020 Census<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> – making it the eighth [[List of largest suburbs by population|most populated suburb in the world]] at the latter date; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 1,912,679 - comprising 961,354 males and 951,325 females.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Tangerang Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.3671)</ref> 

It has not only functioned as a dormitory city, as there are many industrial areas such as Jatake, and several business districts, including CBD [[Alam Sutera]] in the area. Located just next to Jakarta on the west with many road access and improved infrastructure, such as new toll road, it is one of the favorite location for property seekers and investors in the [[Jabodetabek]] area.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ekonomi.bisnis.com/read/20200304/47/1208847/properti-di-kota-mandiri-bakal-laris-diburu-investor |title=Properti di Kota Mandiri Bakal Laris Diburu Investor &#124; Ekonomi |date=4 March 2020 |access-date=3 April 2021 |archive-date=25 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210125073619/https://ekonomi.bisnis.com/read/20200304/47/1208847/properti-di-kota-mandiri-bakal-laris-diburu-investor |url-status=live }}</ref>

Tangerang, along with the neighbouring [[South Tangerang]], is where many large-scale developers have created built-up areas such as [[BSD City]], [[Gading Serpong]], [[Alam Sutera]], [[Modernland]], and [[Lippo Village]], and now becoming the area's center of economy, business, commerce, and education.

Tangerang is also home for [[Soekarno–Hatta International Airport]] which serves the Jakarta metropolitan area and is Indonesia's main gateway. The city is an industrial and manufacturing hub on [[Java]] and is home to over 1,000 factories. Many international corporations have plants in the city. Tangerang tends to be hot and humid, with little in the way of trees or geographical features. Certain areas consist of swamps, including the areas near the [[Soekarno–Hatta International Airport]]. It's also home to [[Indonesia Convention Exhibition]] (ICE) BSD City, Indonesia's largest convention and exhibition center located in BSD City.

In recent years the urban expansion of Jakarta has covered Tangerang. As the result, many of its residents commute to Jakarta for work or vice versa. Many high-class and middle-class [[satellite cities]] have been developed in Tangerang, complete with their own [[shopping mall]]s, private [[school]]s and convenience centers. The government is working on expanding the [[list of toll roads in Indonesia|toll road]] system to accommodate more traffic flow to and from the area.

Tangerang is the corporations' alternative to move or build their offices from [[Jakarta]] due to the heavy traffic and crowds, such as [[Unilever Indonesia]], Kino Group, and [[Alfa Group]].

==History==
=== Origins ===
According to F. de Haan's writings taken from the VOC archives, reports that the [[Banten Sultanate]] had created a large country located west of the Untung Jawa River, and to fill the new land the Sultan of Banten had displaced 5,000 to 6,000 inhabitants.

In the Dag Register dated December 20, 1668, it was reported that the Sultan of Banten had appointed Raden Sena Pati and ''Kyai Demang'' as rulers. On suspicion of seizing the kingdom, Raden Sena Pati and Kyai Demang were sacked by the Sultan.

[[File:Nederlandse militairen van Bataljon Infanterie I KNIL in de straten van Tangera, Bestanddeelnr 6-2-2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dutch East Indies]] army in Tangerang, circa 1946]]
Prince Dipati was appointed to the region. For the dismissal, Ki Demang pitted Banten against the VOC. But he was killed in Kademangan.

The next [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] archive, the Dag Register dated March 4, 1680, explains that the ruler of Tangerang at that time was ''Kyai Dipati Soera Dielaga''. Kyai Soeradilaga and his son Subraja asked for the protection of the VOC, followed by 143 [[retinue]]s and soldiers. He and his retinue were given a place on the east side of the river, bordering the VOC. When fighting with Banten, Soeradilaga and his war experts succeeded in repelling Bantenesu troops. For his services, he was given the honorary title of Raden Aria Suryamanggala, while Prince Subraja was given the title of Kyai Dipati Soetadilaga.

Subsequently, ''Raden Aria Soetadilaga'' was appointed Regent of Tangerang I with an area covering the [[Angke River]] and [[Cisadane River]]. The title he used was Aria Soetidilaga I. Then with an agreement signed on April 17, 1684, Tangerang became part of the territory of the VOC; Banten did not have the right to intervene in regulating governance in Tangerang. One of the articles of the agreement reads: "And it must be known with certainty the extent to which the boundaries of the territory that have been understood since the past will still be determined, namely the area bounded by Tangerang from the Java Sea coast to the mountains to the South Sea. That all land along Tangerang will belong to or be occupied by the VOC".

With the agreement, the regent's territory expanded to the west of the Tangerang river. To monitor Tangerang, it was deemed necessary to add more guard posts along the Tangerang river border, because the Bantenese often attacked suddenly. According to a map made in 1692, the oldest post is located at the mouth of the [[Cisadane River]], to the north of ''Kampung Baru''. However, when a new post was established, the location shifted to the south at the mouth of the Tangerang River. According to the archives of ''Gewone Resolutie van het Casteel Batavia'', on April 3, 1705, there were plans to demolish the buildings in the post because they only had bamboo walls. Then the building was proposed to be replaced with a wall. Governor-General [[Hendrick Zwaardecroon]] strongly agreed with the proposal, and was even instructed to build a wallei fence around the buildings in the guard posts, so that the Bantenese could not attack. The new fort that would be built was planned to have a wall 20 feet thick or more. There will be placed 30 Europeans under the leadership of a Vandrig and 28 Makassarese who will live outside the fort. The basic material for the fort is bricks obtained from Tangerang Regent Aria Soetadilaga I.

After the fort was completed it was manned by 60 Europeans and 30 [[Belanda Hitam|Blacks]] as well as [[Makassar people|Makassarese]] recruited as VOC soldiers. This fort later became the base of the VOC in the face of the rebellion from Banten. Then in 1801, it was decided to repair and strengthen the post or garrison, with a new building located 60 meters to the southeast, precisely located east of Jalan Besar PAL 17. Indigenous people at that time were more familiar with this building as "Fortress". .Since then, Tangerang is known as the Citadel. This fort since 1812 has not been maintained anymore, even according to the "Superintendent of Public Building and Work" dated March 6, 1816 stated:

''"... The fort and barracks in Tangerang are now neglected, no one wants to see them anymore. Many doors and windows were broken and people even took it for their own sake."''

===Indonesian revolution===
In October 1945, {{lang|id|Laskar Hitam}}, a Muslim militia, was established in Tangerang. The goal of this movement was to establish an Islamic nation in Indonesia. This movement later became a part of DI/TII rebel group. On 31 October 1945, {{lang|id|Laskar Hitam}} kidnapped [[Oto Iskandar di Nata|Otto Iskandardinata]], the Republic of Indonesia's Minister of State. He was presumed to have been murdered at Mauk beach, Tangerang on 20 December 1945.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Socians |first=The |date=2019-12-08 |title=Oto Iskandar Dinata: The Indonesian Hero whose Sudden and Mysterious Death Shook the Country |url=https://www.thesocians.com/post/oto-iskandar-dinata-the-indonesian-hero-whose-sudden-and-mysterious-death-shook-the-country |access-date=2022-04-14 |website=Socians |language=en |archive-date=2022-05-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220518001644/https://www.thesocians.com/post/oto-iskandar-dinata-the-indonesian-hero-whose-sudden-and-mysterious-death-shook-the-country |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Recent history===
Tangerang city was formed as an autonomous city on 27 February 1993 out of the [[Tangerang Regency]]. The city was previously an administrative city within that regency.

In 2007, the city government passed an anti-prostitution law, which meant that women who are perceived to be dressed too provocatively may be arrested. Some news outlets reported that some women decided to wear the [[hijab]] to avoid being prosecuted under this law. In addition the city government began requiring municipal employees to abide by Islamic dress codes.<ref name=Warburton>{{cite web |author=Warburton, Eve |url=http://www.insideindonesia.org/no-longer-a-choice |title=No longer a choice |publisher=[[Inside Indonesia]] |date=January–March 2007 |edition=89 |access-date=2017-06-20 |archive-date=2022-03-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220309071315/https://www.insideindonesia.org/no-longer-a-choice |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Economy ==
[[File:Gudang - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|left|230px|Industrial complex in Tangerang]]
Tangerang is the center of manufacturing and industry on the island of Java and has more than 1000 factories. Many international companies have factories in this city. Tangerang has a climate that tends to be hot and humid, with little forest or other geographic areas. Certain areas consist of swamps, including the area around [[Soekarno-Hatta International Airport]].

In recent years, Jakarta's urban expansion has encompassed Tangerang, and as a result many residents commute to Jakarta for work, or vice versa. Many middle-class and upper-class satellite cities are being developed in Tangerang, complete with shopping centers, private schools and mini markets. The government is working on developing a toll road system to accommodate the increasing traffic flow to and from Tangerang. Tangerang was once part of the West Java Province whose western and northwestern cities and regencies were separated off in 2000 to become the new Banten Province.

[[File:Karawaci, Tangerang.jpg|thumb|Office and apartment towers in Karawaci, Tangerang]]
Tangerang's economy depends highly on service sectors, trading, financial service, and manufacturing. Jatake, which is Tangerang's biggest industrial area, is home to over 1,000 industrial corporations.

As the impact of Jakarta's growing economy continues, Tangerang has become an alternative location for some corporations in which to build their offices due to crowds and land prices. CBD in [[Alam Sutera]] is the notable central business district, comprising several corporations, business centers, apartments, and educational facilities. Some headquarters of big corporations are located here, such as Kino Group, Alfamart, Deltomed, Top Food, and more. It also has several business center nearby, such as [[Lippo Karawaci]] and [[Gading Serpong]], both are located in Tangerang Regency.
