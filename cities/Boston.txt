The settlement's name came from Johnson's hometown of [[Boston, Lincolnshire]], from which he, his wife (namesake of the ''[[Arbella]]'') and [[John Cotton (minister)|John Cotton]] (grandfather of [[Cotton Mather]]) had [[Puritan migration to New England (1620–1640)|emigrated]] to [[New England]]. The name of the English town ultimately derives from its patron saint, [[Botolph of Thorney|St. Botolph]], in [[St Botolph's Church, Boston|whose church]] John Cotton served as the rector until his emigration with Johnson. In early sources, Lincolnshire's Boston was known as "St. Botolph's town", later contracted to "Boston". Before this renaming, the settlement on the peninsula had been known as "Shawmut" by [[William Blaxton]] and "Tremontaine"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/us-states/boston-massachusetts|title=Boston|date=March 13, 2019|website=HISTORY}}</ref> by the Puritan settlers he had invited.<ref name="DNB1">{{DNB |wstitle= Johnson, Isaac |volume= 30 |last= Goodwin |first= Gordon |author-link= |page= 15 |short= 1}}</ref><ref name="Weston">Weston, George F.

=== European settlement===
The first European to live in what would become Boston was a [[Cambridge]]-educated [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] cleric named [[William Blaxton]]. He was the person most directly responsible for the foundation of Boston by Puritan colonists in 1630. This occurred after Blaxton invited one of their leaders, [[Isaac Johnson (colonist)|Isaac Johnson]], to cross [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] from the failing colony of [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]] and share the peninsula. The Puritans made the crossing in September 1630.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Morison |first=Samuel Eliot |title=English University Men Who Emigrated to New England Before 1646: An Advanced Printing of Appendix B to the History of Harvard College in the Seventeenth Century |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1932 |location=Cambridge, MA |pages=10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Morison |first=Samuel Eliot |title=The Founding of Harvard College |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1963 |isbn=9780674314504 |location=Cambridge, Mass}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Banks |first=Charles Edward |title=Topographical dictionary of 2885 English emigrants to New England, 1620–1650 |publisher=The Bertram press |year=1937 |pages=96}}</ref>

Puritan influence on Boston began even before the settlement was founded with the 1629 [[Cambridge Agreement]]. This document created the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and was signed by its first governor [[John Winthrop]]. Puritan ethics and their focus on education also influenced the early history of the city. America's first public school, [[Boston Latin School]], was founded in Boston in 1635.<ref name="BPS" />{{sfn|Christopher|2006|p=46}}

Boston was the largest town in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] until [[Philadelphia]] outgrew it in the mid-18th century.<ref>{{cite web |year=2006 |title="Growth" to Boston in its Heyday, 1640s to 1730s |url=http://bostonhistorycollaborative.com/pdf/Era2.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723034439/http://bostonhistorycollaborative.com/pdf/Era2.pdf |archive-date=July 23, 2013 |access-date=March 5, 2013 |publisher=Boston History & Innovation Collaborative |page=2}}</ref> Boston's [[shore|oceanfront location]] made it a lively [[port]], and the then-town primarily engaged in [[shipping]] and fishing during its colonial days.

Boston's economy stagnated in the decades prior to the Revolution. By the mid-18th century, [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]] had surpassed Boston in wealth. During this period, Boston encountered financial difficulties even as other cities in New England grew rapidly.<ref name="newamernation">{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Robert W. |title=Encyclopedia of the New American Nation |year=2005 |publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]] |isbn=978-0684313467 |edition=1st |location=Detroit, MI |pages=214–219}}</ref><ref name="empireontheedge">{{cite book |last=Bunker |first=Nick |title=An Empire on the Edge: How Britain Came to Fight America |date=2014 |publisher=Knopf |isbn=978-0307594846}}</ref>

Many crucial events of the [[American Revolution]]{{sfn|Morris|2005|p=7}} occurred in or near Boston. The then-town's mob presence, along with the colonists' growing lack of faith in either [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] or [[Parliament of Great Britain|its Parliament]], fostered a revolutionary spirit there.<ref name="newamernation" /> When the British parliament passed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] in 1765, a Boston mob ravaged the homes of [[Andrew Oliver]], the official tasked with enforcing the Act, and [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]], then the Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts.<ref name="newamernation" /><ref>{{cite journal |last=Morgan |first=Edmund S. |date=1946 |title=Thomas Hutchinson and the Stamp Act |journal=The New England Quarterly |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=459–492 |doi=10.2307/361566 |jstor=361566|issn = 0028-4866}}</ref> The British sent two regiments to Boston in 1768 in an attempt to quell the angry colonists. This did not sit well with the colonists, however. In 1770, during the [[Boston Massacre]], British troops shot into a crowd that had started to violently harass them. The colonists compelled the British to withdraw their troops. The event was widely publicized and fueled a revolutionary movement in America.<ref name="empireontheedge" />

In 1773, Parliament passed the [[Tea Act]]. Many of the colonists saw the act as an attempt to force them to accept the taxes established by the [[Townshend Acts]]. The act prompted the [[Boston Tea Party]], where a group of angered Bostonians threw an entire shipment of tea sent by the [[East India Company]] into [[Boston Harbor]]. The Boston Tea Party was a key event leading up to the revolution, as the British government responded furiously with the [[Intolerable Acts|Coercive Acts]], demanding compensation for the destroyed tea from the Bostonians.<ref name="newamernation" /> This angered the colonists further and led to the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The war began in the area surrounding Boston with the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]].<ref name="newamernation" /><ref name="frothingham">{{cite book |last=Frothingham |first=Richard Jr. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cu9BAAAAIAAJ |title=History of the Siege of Boston and of the Battles of Lexington, Concord, and Bunker Hill |publisher=Little and Brown |year=1851 |access-date=May 21, 2018 |archive-date=June 23, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623231826/https://books.google.com/books?id=Cu9BAAAAIAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Boston itself was besieged for almost a year during the [[siege of Boston]], which began on April 19, 1775. The New England militia impeded the movement of the [[British Army]]. [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe]], then the commander-in-chief of the British forces in North America, led the British army in the siege. On June 17, the British captured Charlestown (now part of Boston) during the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. The British army outnumbered the militia stationed there, but it was a [[pyrrhic victory]] for the British because their army suffered irreplaceable casualties. It was also a testament to the skill and training of the militia, as their stubborn defense made it difficult for the British to capture Charlestown without suffering further irreplaceable casualties.<ref name="allemn">{{cite book |last=French |first=Allen |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_PqZcY9z3Vn4C |title=The Siege of Boston |publisher=Macmillan |year=1911 |ref=French |author-link=Allen French}}</ref><ref name="1776book">{{cite book |last=McCullough |first=David |title=1776 |title-link=1776 (book) |date=2005 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=978-0-7432-2671-4 |location=New York, NY}}</ref>

Several weeks later, [[George Washington]] took over the militia after the [[Continental Congress]] established the [[Continental Army]] to unify the revolutionary effort. Both sides faced difficulties and supply shortages in the siege, and the fighting was limited to small-scale raids and skirmishes. The narrow Boston Neck, which at that time was only about a hundred feet wide, impeded Washington's ability to invade Boston, and a long stalemate ensued. A young officer, [[Rufus Putnam]], came up with a plan to make portable fortifications out of wood that could be erected on the frozen ground under cover of darkness. Putnam supervised this effort, which successfully installed both the fortifications and dozens of cannons on [[Dorchester Heights]] that [[Henry Knox]] had laboriously brought through the snow from [[Fort Ticonderoga]]. The astonished British awoke the next morning to see a large array of cannons bearing down on them. General Howe is believed to have said that the Americans had done more in one night than his army could have done in six months. The British Army attempted a cannon barrage for two hours, but their shot could not reach the colonists' cannons at such a height. The British gave up, boarded their ships, and sailed away. This has become known as "[[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|Evacuation Day]]", which Boston still celebrates each year on March 17. After this, Washington was so impressed that he made Rufus Putnam his chief engineer.<ref name="frothingham" /><ref name="allemn" /><ref>Hubbard, Robert Ernest.

===Post-revolution and the War of 1812===
[[File:Old State House and State Street, Boston 1801.jpg|thumb|upright=1|left|[[State Street (Boston)|State Street]] in 1801]]
After the Revolution, Boston's long [[seafaring]] tradition helped make it one of the nation's busiest ports for both domestic and international trade. Boston's harbor activity was significantly curtailed by the [[Embargo Act of 1807]] (adopted during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]) and the [[War of 1812]]. Foreign trade returned after these hostilities, but Boston's merchants had found alternatives for their capital investments in the meantime. Manufacturing became an important component of the city's economy, and the city's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance by the mid-19th century. The small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills and factories. Later, a dense network of railroads furthered the region's industry and commerce.{{sfn|Kennedy|1994|p=46}}

Boston went into decline by the early to mid-20th century, as factories became old and obsolete and businesses moved out of the region for cheaper labor elsewhere.{{sfn|Bluestone|Stevenson|2002|p=13}} Boston responded by initiating various [[urban renewal]] projects, under the direction of the [[Boston Planning and Development Agency|Boston Redevelopment Authority]] (BRA) established in 1957. In 1958, BRA initiated a project to improve the historic West End neighborhood. Extensive demolition was met with strong public opposition, and thousands of families were displaced.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Collins, Monica |date=August 7, 2005 |title=Born Again |work=The Boston Globe |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2005/08/07/born_again/ |access-date=May 8, 2007 |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165937/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2005/08/07/born_again/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The BRA continued implementing [[eminent domain]] projects, including the clearance of the vibrant [[Scollay Square]] area for construction of the modernist style [[Government Center, Boston|Government Center]]. In 1965, the Columbia Point Health Center opened in the [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] neighborhood, the first [[Community health centers in the United States|Community Health Center]] in the United States. It mostly served the massive [[Columbia Point (Boston)|Columbia Point]] public housing complex adjoining it, which was built in 1953.

By the 1970s, the city's economy had begun to recover after 30 years of economic downturn. A large number of high-rises were constructed in the [[Financial District, Boston|Financial District]] and in Boston's [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] during this period.{{sfn|Kennedy|1994|p=195}} This boom continued into the mid-1980s and resumed after a few pauses. Hospitals such as [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], and [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] lead the nation in medical innovation and patient care. Schools such as the [[Boston Architectural College]], [[Boston College]], [[Boston University]], the [[Harvard Medical School]], [[Tufts University School of Medicine]], [[Northeastern University]], [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]], [[Wentworth Institute of Technology]], [[Berklee College of Music]], the [[Boston Conservatory]], and many others attract students to the area. Nevertheless, the city experienced conflict starting in 1974 over [[desegregation busing]], which resulted in unrest and violence around public schools throughout the mid-1970s.{{sfn|Kennedy|1994|pp=194–195}} Boston has also experienced [[gentrification]] in the latter half of the 20th century,<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hampson |first=Rick |date=April 19, 2005 |title=Studies: Gentrification a boost for everyone |work=USA Today |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-04-19-gentrification_x.htm |access-date=May 2, 2009 |archive-date=June 28, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628203315/http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-04-19-gentrification_x.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> with housing prices increasing sharply since the 1990s when the city's [[rent control]] regime was struck down by statewide [[ballot proposition]].<ref name="Heudorfer">{{Cite web |last1=Heudorfer, Bonnie |last2=Bluestone, Barry |title=The Greater Boston Housing Report Card |url=http://www.tbf.org/uploadedFiles/Housing%20Report%20Card%202004.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108003526/http://www.tbf.org/uploadedFiles/Housing%20Report%20Card%202004.pdf |archive-date=November 8, 2006 |access-date=December 12, 2016 |publisher=Center for Urban and Regional Policy (CURP), Northeastern University |page=6}}</ref>

More than two-thirds of inner Boston's modern land area did not exist when the city was founded. Instead, it was created via the gradual filling in of the surrounding tidal areas over the centuries.<ref name="landfills" /> This was accomplished using earth from the leveling or lowering of Boston's three original hills (the "Trimountain", after which Tremont Street is named), as well as with gravel brought by train from Needham to fill the [[Back Bay]].{{sfn|Morris|2005|p=8}}

The geography of downtown and South Boston was particularly affected by the Central Artery/Tunnel Project (which ran from 1991 to 2007, and was known unofficially as the "[[Big Dig]]"). That project removed the elevated [[Central Artery]] and incorporated new green spaces and open areas.{{sfn|Morris|2005|pp=54, 102}}

From the 1950s to the end of the 20th century, the proportion of [[non-Hispanic Whites]] in the city declined. In 2000, non-Hispanic Whites made up 49.5% of the city's population, making the city [[majority minority]] for the first time. However, in the 21st century, the city has experienced significant [[gentrification]], during which affluent Whites have moved into formerly non-White areas. In 2006, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated non-Hispanic Whites again formed a slight majority but {{As of|2010|lc=y}}, in part due to the housing crash, as well as increased efforts to make more affordable housing more available, the non-White population has rebounded. This may also have to do with increased [[Latin America]]n and [[Asian Americans|Asian]] populations and more clarity surrounding U.S. Census statistics, which indicate a non-Hispanic White population of 47% (some reports give slightly lower figures).<ref>{{Cite web |year=2008 |title=Boston, Massachusetts |url=http://www.bestplaces.net/city/Boston_MA-PEOPLE-52507000010.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318095419/http://www.bestplaces.net/city/Boston_MA-PEOPLE-52507000010.aspx |archive-date=March 18, 2008 |access-date=April 6, 2008 |publisher=Sperling's BestPlaces}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Jonas |first=Michael |date=August 3, 2008 |title=Majority-minority no more? |work=The Boston Globe |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/08/03/majority_minority_no_more/ |access-date=November 30, 2009 |archive-date=May 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514000506/http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/08/03/majority_minority_no_more/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=March 23, 2011 |title=Boston 2010 Census: Facts & Figures |url=http://www.bostonredevelopmentauthoritynews.org/2011/03/23/boston-census-facts-figures/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118161450/http://www.bostonredevelopmentauthoritynews.org/2011/03/23/boston-census-facts-figures/ |archive-date=January 18, 2012 |access-date=February 13, 2012 |publisher=Boston Redevelopment Authority News}}</ref>

Like many major American cities, Boston has experienced a great reduction in violent crime since the early 1990s. Boston's low crime rate since the 1990s has been credited to the Boston Police Department's collaboration with neighborhood groups and church parishes to prevent youths from joining gangs, as well as involvement from the [[United States Attorney|United States Attorney and District Attorney]]'s offices. This helped lead in part to what has been touted as the "Boston Miracle". Murders in the city dropped from 152 in 1990 (for a murder rate of 26.5 per 100,000 people) to just 31—not one of them a juvenile—in 1999 (for a murder rate of 5.26 per 100,000).<ref name="End of a Miracle">{{cite web |url=http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/soc/faculty/winship/End_of_a_Miracle.pdf |title=End of a Miracle? |last=Winship |first=Christopher |date=March 2002 |publisher=Harvard University |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522063733/http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/soc/faculty/winship/End_of_a_Miracle.pdf |archive-date=May 22, 2012 |access-date=February 19, 2007}}</ref>
