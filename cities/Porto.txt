During the period of [[Roman Empire]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the city developed as an important commercial port, primarily in the trade between ''Olissipona'' (the modern [[Lisbon]]) and ''Bracara Augusta'' (the modern [[Braga]]).<ref name="Timeline"/> Porto was also important during the [[Suebian]] and [[Visigothic]] times, and a center for the expansion of Christianity during that period.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.scielo.mec.pt/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&pid=S0807-89672013000200016&lng=pt&nrm=iso&tlng=pt|title=Vestígios da presença sueva no noroeste da península ibérica: na etnologia, na arqueologia e na língua|first1=Larisa|last1=Semënova-Head|first2=Brian F.|last2=Head|journal=Revista Diacrítica|volume=27|issue=2|pages=257–277|access-date=29 December 2018|archive-date=13 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210413111802/http://www.scielo.mec.pt/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&pid=S0807-89672013000200016&lng=pt&nrm=iso&tlng=pt|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1093, [[Theresa, Countess of Portugal|Teresa of León]], illegitimate daughter of the king [[Alfonso VI of Castile]], married [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy]], bringing the [[County of Portugal]] as dowry. This ''Condado Portucalense'' became the focus of what has been called the [[Reconquista]], and later became the independent [[Kingdom of Portugal]], after eventually expanding to its current frontiers into the south as it conquered territory inhabited by the Muslim [[Moors]] for centuries, under the reign of King [[Afonso I of Portugal]] at the beginning of the 12th century.

In 1387, Porto was the site of the marriage of [[John I of Portugal]] and [[Philippa of Lancaster]], daughter of [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]]; this symbolized a long-standing [[Collective security|military alliance]] between Portugal and [[Kingdom of England|England]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/645224/Treaty-of-Windsor|title=Treaty of Windsor – British-Portugal|encyclopedia=britannica.com|access-date=10 February 2016|archive-date=26 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226105509/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/645224/Treaty-of-Windsor|url-status=live}}</ref> The Portuguese-English alliance (see the [[Treaty of Windsor (1386)|Treaty of Windsor]]) is the world's oldest recorded military alliance.<ref name="Arquivo Nacional Torre do Tombo">{{cite web |title=Tratado de paz, amizade e confederação entre D.

By the 13th century, the wine produced in the [[Douro DOC|Douro valley]] was already being transported to Porto in ''barcos rabelos'' (flat sailing vessels). In 1703, the [[Methuen Treaty]] established trade relations and a military alliance between Portugal and England.<ref>Francis, A.D. ''John Methuen and the Anglo-Portuguese Treaties of 1703''. The Historical Journal Vol. 3, No. 2, pp.&nbsp;103 – 124.</ref> In 1717, the first English trading post was established in Porto. The production of [[port wine]] then gradually passed into the hands of a few English firms. To counter this dominance, Prime Minister [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal|Marquis of Pombal]] established a monopolistic Portuguese firm to receive all the wines from the Douro valley. He demarcated the region for the production of port, to ensure the wine's quality; this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe, which was almost a century ahead of a similar exercise in Bordeaux.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023 |title=The History of Port: The Marquis of Pombal |url=https://www.taylor.pt/en/what-is-port-wine/history-of-port/the-marquis-of-pombal |access-date=30 October 2024 |website=Taylor's Port}}</ref> The small winegrowers revolted against his strict policies on [[Shrove Tuesday]], burning down the buildings of this firm. The revolt became known as the ''Revolta dos Borrachos'' (revolt of the drunkards).{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}}

Between 1732 and 1763, Italian architect [[Nicolau Nasoni]] designed a [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] church with a tower that became its architectural and visual icon: the [[Clérigos Church|Torre dos Clérigos]] (English: Clerics' Tower). During the 18th and 19th centuries, the city became an important industrial center and its size and population increased.{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}}

===19th century===
The invasion of the [[Napoleonic]] troops in Portugal under Marshal [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] brought war to the city of Porto. On 29 March 1809, as the population fled from the [[First Battle of Porto|advancing French troops]]<ref name="Smith">Smith</ref><ref name="Glover">Glover</ref> and tried to cross the river Douro over the ''Ponte das Barcas'' (a pontoon bridge), [[Porto Boat Bridge disaster|the bridge collapsed under the weight]].

The [[French Army]] was [[Second Battle of Porto|rooted out of]] Porto by [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], when his [[Anglo-Portuguese Army]] crossed the Douro River from the Mosteiro da Serra do Pilar (a former convent) in a brilliant daylight ''[[coup de main]]'', using wine barges to transport the troops, outflanking the French Army.<ref name=TPENWAR1>{{cite book|title=The Peninsular War 1807 – 1814, A Concise Military History|last=Glover|first=Michael|publisher=Penguin Books|date=1974|isbn=9780141390413|pages=96–97 description of the retreat of Soult along the Valongo and Amaranthe road}}</ref><ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle= Oporto |volume= 20 | pages = 137–139; see page 139| quote = The town is renowned in British military annals from the duke of Wellington's passage of the Douro, by which he surprised and put to flight the French army under Marshal Soult, capturing the city on the 12th of May 1809}}</ref>

Influenced by liberal revolutions occurring in Europe, the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]] started in Porto.<ref>CasaHistória website, [http://www.casahistoria.net/Brazil.htm#Independence "Independence and Empire"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706075126/http://www.casahistoria.net/Brazil.htm#Independence |date=6 July 2018 }}, retrieved 12 June 2007</ref> The revolutionaries demanded the return of [[John VI of Portugal]], who had [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|transferred the Portuguese Court]] to the Portuguese [[Colonial Brazil|colony of Brazil]] since the French invasions of Portugal, it also demanded a constitutional monarchy to be set up in Portugal. In 1822, a liberal constitution was accepted, partly through the efforts of the liberal assembly of Porto (Junta do Porto). When [[Miguel I of Portugal]] took the Portuguese throne in 1828, he rejected this constitution and reigned as an anti-liberal, absolutist monarch.<ref>{{cite book|first=António Silva Lopes|last=Rocha|publisher=R.

Known as the city of bridges, Porto built its first permanent bridge, the ''Ponte das Barcas'' (a [[pontoon bridge]]), in 1806. Three years later, it collapsed under the weight of thousands of fugitives from the French invasions during the [[Peninsular War]], causing thousands of deaths.<ref>[http://www.jn.pt/Dossies/dossie.aspx?content_id=1185176&dossier=200%20anos%20das%20invas%F5es%20francesas O desastre da ponte das barcas] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521161931/http://www.jn.pt/Dossies/dossie.aspx?content_id=1185176&dossier=200%20anos%20das%20invas%F5es%20francesas |date=21 May 2014 }} Jornal de Notícias, 29 March 2009 {{in lang|pt}}</ref> It was replaced by the [[:pt:Ponte D.

The monarchy was deposed less than a month later and no other monarchist revolution in Portugal happened again.

The historic center of Porto was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1996.

Situated at 280Km from Lisbon, in 1996, [[UNESCO]] recognized Porto's historic centre as a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name=Timeline /> Among the architectural highlights of the city, Porto [[Porto Cathedral|Cathedral]] is the oldest surviving structure, together with the small [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] [[Church of Cedofeita]], the [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] [[Igreja de São Francisco (Porto)|Igreja de São Francisco]] (Church of [[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis]]), the remnants of the [[Defensive wall|city walls]] and a few 15th-century houses. The [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] style is well represented in the city in the elaborate gilt work [[Interior design|interior decoration]] of the churches of St. Francis (''São Francisco'') and St. Claire (''Santa Clara''), the churches of Mercy (''Misericórdia'') and of the Clerics (''[[Clérigos Church|Clérigos]]''), the [[Episcopal Palace of Porto]], and others. The [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassicism]] and [[romanticism]] of the 19th and 20th centuries also added interesting monuments to the landscape of the city, like the magnificent Stock Exchange Palace (''[[Palácio da Bolsa]]''), the Hospital of [[Anthony of Padua|Saint Anthony]], the Municipality, the buildings in the [[Liberdade Square (Porto)|Liberdade Square]] and the ''Avenida dos Aliados'', the tile-adorned [[São Bento railway station]] and the gardens of the [[Crystal Palace (Porto)|Crystal Palace]] (''Palácio de Cristal''). A guided visit to the [[Palácio da Bolsa]], and in particular, the Arab Room is a major [[tourist attraction]].

Porto features a [[Mediterranean climate|warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csb''), with influences of an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb''), common in the north of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0GNLDwAAQBAJ&q=oceanic+climate+influence+cfb+portugal&pg=PA14|title=Passive Energy Strategies for Mediterranean Residential Buildings: Facing the Challenges of Climate Change and Vulnerable Populations|last1=Monge-Barrio|first1=Aurora|last2=Gutiérrez|first2=Ana Sánchez-Ostiz|date=9 February 2018|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319698830|language=en|access-date=19 October 2020|archive-date=2 October 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241002234750/https://books.google.com/books?id=0GNLDwAAQBAJ&q=oceanic+climate+influence+cfb+portugal&pg=PA14#v=snippet&q=oceanic%20climate%20influence%20cfb%20portugal&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref> As a result, its climate shares many characteristics with the warm, dry Mediterranean climates of southern Europe and the wet marine west coast climates of the North Atlantic, providing it warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. Cool and rainy days can, occasionally, interrupt the sunny weather. These occasional summer rainy periods may last a few days and are characterized by showers and cool temperatures around {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}} in the afternoon. The annual precipitation is high and concentrated in the winter months, making Porto one of the wettest major cities of Europe. However, long periods with warmer temperatures and sunny days are frequent even during the rainiest months.

Summers are typically sunny, with average temperatures between {{convert|16|and|26|°C|0|abbr=on}}, but can rise to as high as {{convert|38|°C|0|abbr=on}} during occasional heat waves. During such heatwaves, the [[humidity]] remains quite low. Nearby beaches are often windy and usually cooler than the urban areas. Summer average temperatures are a few degrees cooler than those expected in more continentally Mediterranean-influenced Portuguese cities because of the oceanic influence.

Winter temperatures typically range between {{convert|6|°C|0|abbr=on}} early in the morning and {{convert|15|°C|0|abbr=on}} in the afternoon, but rarely drop below {{convert|0|°C|0|abbr=on}} at night. The weather is often rainy for long stretches, although prolonged sunny periods do occur.

{{Further|topic=the international company that develops digital banking platforms|ebankIT}}
Porto plus the [[conurbation]] to which it belongs and has Porto municipality as its central core forming the nucleus of the conurbation, is a major industrial and financial center of both Portugal and the Iberian Peninsula. As the most important city in the heavily industrialized northwest, many of the largest Portuguese corporations from diverse [[Economy|economic sectors]], like [[Altri]], [[Ambar – Ideas on Paper S.A.|Ambar]], [[Corticeira Amorim|Amorim]], [[Bial]], [[Banco Português de Investimento|BPI]], [[Cerealis]], [[Corporação Industrial do Norte|CIN]], [[Cofina]], [[EFACEC]], [[Frulact]], [[Lactogal]], [[Banco Comercial Português|Millennium bcp]], Porto [[Porto Editora|Editora]], [[Grupo RAR|RAR]], [[Sonae]], [[Sonae Indústria]], and [[Super Bock Group]], are headquartered in the [[Greater Metropolitan Area of Porto]], most notably, in the core municipalities of [[Maia (city)|Maia]], [[Matosinhos]], Porto, and [[Vila Nova de Gaia]].

The city's former [[stock exchange]] ([[Euronext Lisbon|Bolsa do Porto]]) was transformed into the largest [[Futures exchange|derivatives exchange]] of Portugal, and merged with [[Euronext Lisbon|Lisbon Stock Exchange]] to create the [[Euronext Lisbon|Bolsa de Valores de Lisboa e Porto]], which eventually merged with [[Euronext]], together with Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris stock and [[futures exchange]]s. The building formerly hosting the stock exchange is currently one of the city's touristic attractions, with the Salão Árabe (Arab Room in English) being its major highlight. The [[Banco Português de Fomento]] (BPF), a Portuguese state-owned development bank established in 2020, is headquartered in Porto.

Porto hosts a popular Portuguese newspaper, ''[[Jornal de Notícias]]''. The building where its offices are located (which has the same name as the newspaper) was at a time one of the tallest in the city (it has been superseded by a number of modern buildings which have been built since the 1990s).{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

[[Porto Editora]], one of the biggest Portuguese publishers, is also located in Porto. Its dictionaries are among the most popular references used in the country, and the translations are very popular as well.

The economic relations between the city of Porto and the Upper [[Douro]] River have been documented since the [[Middle Ages]]. However, they were greatly deepened in the modern age. {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Indeed, [[sumac]]h, dry fruits and [[Nut (fruit)|nut]]s and the Douro [[olive oil]]s sustained prosperous exchanges between the region and Porto. From the riverside quays at the river mouth, these products were exported to other markets of the [[Old World|Old]] and [[New World]]. However, the greatest lever to interregional trade relations resulted from the commercial dynamics of the [[Port wine]] (''Vinho do Porto'') agro-industry. {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} It decidedly bolstered the complementary relationship between the large coastal urban centre, endowed with open doors to the sea, and a region with significant agricultural potential, especially in terms of the production of extremely high quality [[fortified wine]]s, known by the world-famous label ''Port''. The development of Porto was also closely connected with the left margin of River Douro in [[Vila Nova de Gaia]], where is located the amphitheater-shaped slope with the Port wine cellars.

[[File:Vila Nova de Gaia from Porto (6847153331).jpg|thumb|South side of Douro, Vila Nova de Gaia]]
The city is very much the gateway to Portugal's northern region as well as the northern and western areas of Spain. Within a two-hour drive of Porto's airport, there are four Unesco World Heritage sites and popular Spanish tourist hotspots such as Santiago de Compostela.
In a study concerning [[Competition (companies)|competitiveness]] of the 18 Portuguese district capitals, Porto was the worst-ranked.

[[File:Ribera area along the river Duoro, Porto, Portugal, 2019.jpg|thumb|The Ribeira area along the river Douro, part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site]]
Over the last few years, Porto has experienced significant tourism increases, which may be partly linked to the [[Ryanair]] hub at Francisco de Sá Carneiro Airport. Porto won the European Best Destination 2012, 2014 and 2017 awards.<ref name="test">{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanbestdestinations.org/top/europe-best-destinations-2014/|title=Europe's best destinations 2014 – Europe's Best Destinations|work=europeanbestdestinations.org|access-date=26 May 2014|archive-date=28 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528005838/http://www.europeanbestdestinations.org/top/europe-best-destinations-2014/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Transport==
===Roads and bridges===
[[File:VCI.svg|thumb|right|Internal highway]]

The road system capacity is augmented by the ''Via de Cintura Interna'' or A20, an internal highway connected to several motorways and city exits, complementing the ''Circunvalação'' 4-lane peripheric road, which borders the north of the city and connects the eastern side of the city to the Atlantic shore. The city is connected to Valença ([[Viana do Castelo]]) by highway A28, to Estarreja ([[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]]) by the A29, to [[Lisbon]] by the A1, to [[Bragança, Portugal|Bragança]] by the A4 and to [[Braga]] by the A3. There is also an outer-ring road, the A41, that connects all the main cities around Porto, linking the city to other major metropolitan highways such as the A7, A11, A42, A43 and A44. Since 2011, a new highway, the A32, connects the metropolitan area to [[São João da Madeira]] and [[Oliveira de Azeméis]].
[[File:Luís I Bridge, Porto, Portugal.jpg|thumb|Luís I Bridge, September 2019]]
The [[Dom Luís I Bridge]] (Ponte de Dom Luís I) is a double-deck metal arch bridge that spans the River Douro between Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia. Built in 1886, its 172 metres (564&nbsp;ft) span was then the longest of its type in the world. The top-level is used for the Porto Metro trains, with an option for pedestrians; the lower level carries traffic and pedestrians.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.travel-in-portugal.com/attractions/dom-luis-i-bridge.htm|title=Dom Luis I Bridge|website=Portugal Travel Guide|access-date=28 September 2019|archive-date=28 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190928010642/https://www.travel-in-portugal.com/attractions/dom-luis-i-bridge.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

During the 20th century, major bridges were built: ''[[Arrábida Bridge]]'', which at its opening had the biggest concrete supporting arch in the world, and connects the north and south shores of the Douro on the west side of the city, ''[[Ponte de São João|S. João]]'', to replace ''D. Maria Pia'' and ''[[Freixo Bridge|Freixo]]'', a highway bridge on the east side of the city. The newest bridge is [[Infante Dom Henrique Bridge]], finished in 2003. Two more bridges are said to be under designing stages and due to be built in the next 10 years, one on the Campo Alegre area, nearby the Faculty of Humanities and the Arts, and another one in the area known as the Massarelos valley. {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Porto is often referred to as ''Cidade das Pontes'' (City of the Bridges), besides its more traditional nicknames of "Cidade Invicta" (Unconquered/ Invincible City) and "Capital do Norte" (Capital of the North).

=== Cruising ===
In July 2015 a new [[Porto Leixões Cruise Terminal|cruise terminal]] was opened at the port of Leixões, which is north of the city in [[Matosinhos]].

===Airport===
[[File:Aeroporto Porto 17.jpg|thumb|right|Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport]]

Porto is served by [[Francisco de Sá Carneiro Airport]] which is located in Pedras Rubras, Moreira da Maia civil parish of the neighbouring [[Maia (city)|Municipality of Maia]], some {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=off}} to the north-west of the city centre.

====Railways====
[[File:Estación de tren São Bento, Oporto, Portugal, 2012-05-09, DD 10.JPG|thumb|right|[[São Bento railway station]]]]
[[File:Estación de tren São Bento, Oporto, Portugal, 2019-06-02, DD 06.jpg|thumb|right|[[Azulejo]]s at São Bento]]
Porto's main railway station is [[Campanhã railway station]], located in the eastern part of the city and connected to the lines of Douro (Peso da Régua/Tua/Pocinho), Minho (Barcelos/Viana do Castelo/Valença) and centre of Portugal (on the main line to [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]], [[Coimbra]] and [[Lisbon]]).

From Campanhã station, both [[Porto Metro|light rail]] and [[Regional rail|suburban rail]] services connect to the city center. The main [[central station]] is [[São Bento railway station|São Bento Station]], which is itself a notable landmark in the heart of Porto. This station was built between 1900 and 1916, based on plans by architect José Marques da Silva. The large panels of azulejo tile were designed by Jorge Colaço; the murals represent moments in the country's history and rural scenes showing the people of various regions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.do-tours.com/en/blog/|title=Les Nouveautés Do Tours &#124; Do Tours|first=Do|last=Tours|access-date=23 January 2020|archive-date=16 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200616045005/https://www.do-tours.com/en/blog/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Porto is connected with [[Lisbon]] via high-speed trains, ''[[Alfa Pendular]]'', that cover the distance in 2h 42min. The intercities take slightly more than 3 hours to cover the same distance.

====Light rail====
[[File:Puente Don Luis I, Oporto, Portugal, 2012-05-09, DD 14.JPG|thumb|[[Porto Metro]] [[light rail]]]]
Currently, the major network is the [[Porto Metro]], a [[light rail]] system. Consequently, the Infante bridge was built for urban traffic, replacing the Dom Luís I, which was dedicated to the light rail on the second and higher of the bridge's two levels. Six lines are open: lines A (blue), B (red), C (green) and E (purple) all begin at [[Estádio do Dragão]] (home to [[FC Porto]]) and terminate at Senhor de Matosinhos, [[Póvoa de Varzim]] (via [[Vila do Conde]]), [[ISMAI]] (via Maia) and Francisco Sá Carneiro airport respectively. Line D (yellow) currently runs from Hospital S. João in the north to Vila d'Este on the southern side of the Douro river. Line F (orange), from Senhora da Hora (Matosinhos) to Fânzeres (Gondomar). The lines intersect at the central [[Trindade (station)|Trindade]] station. Currently, the whole network spans {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} using 85 stations,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Metro em números |url=https://www.metrodoporto.pt/pages/307 |access-date=2024-08-18 |website=www.metrodoporto.pt |language=pt-PT |archive-date=24 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240924210650/https://www.metrodoporto.pt/pages/307 |url-status=live }}</ref> thus being the biggest [[urban rail transit]] system in the country.

===Arts===
[[File:Porto - Matosinhos - Praça da Cidade de Salvador.jpg|thumb|On the waterfront, ''[[She Changes]]'' sculpture by artist [[Janet Echelman]]]]

Porto was the birthplace in 1856 of [[Susanna Roope Dockery]], an Anglo-Portuguese watercolour painter who produced many paintings of the city and the people and landscape of the surrounding rural areas. An Englishman, [[Frederick William Flower]], moved to Oporto in 1834 at the age of 19 to work in the wine trade and subsequently became a pioneer of photography in Portugal. Like Dockery, he drew his inspiration from the city, the Douro river and the rural areas.

In 2005, the municipality funded a [[Public art|public sculpture]] to be built in the Waterfront Plaza of [[Matosinhos]]. The resulting sculpture is entitled ''[[She Changes]]''<ref>[http://www.sculpture.org/documents/scmag05/julaug_05/echelman.shtml Janet Echelman's She Changes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205161717/http://www.sculpture.org/documents/scmag05/julaug_05/echelman.shtml |date=5 February 2012 }} Sculpture Magazine July–August 2005</ref> by American artist, [[Janet Echelman]], and spans the height of 50&nbsp;×&nbsp;150&nbsp;×&nbsp;150 metres.

Henrique''). Due to the recognition, potential for employment and higher revenue, there are many students from the entire country, particularly from the [[Norte Region, Portugal|north of Portugal]], attending a college or university in Porto.

For foreigners wishing to study Portuguese in the city there are a number of options. As the most popular city in Portugal for [[Erasmus Programme|ERASMUS]] students, most universities have facilities to assist foreigners in learning the language {{fact|date=October 2024}}. There are also several private language learning institutions in the city.

==Sport==
[[File:Palaciodecristalporto.jpg|thumb|right|[[Super Bock Arena]] – Pavilhão Rosa Mota]]
Porto, in addition to football stadia since football is by far the most popular sport in Oporto and across the entire country, is home to many athletic sports arenas, most notably the city-owned [[Super Bock Arena]] (formerly Pavilhão Rosa Mota), swimming pools in the area of ''Constituição'' (between the ''Marquês'' and ''Boavista''), and other minor arenas, such as the ''Pavilhão do Académico'', as well as to other sports fields. These sports arenas, swimming pools and sports fields are used for the practice of sports, including varsity and competitive professional sports, in a diversity of sport disciplines ranging from handball, basketball, futsal and field hockey to rink hockey, volleyball, water polo and rugby.

Porto is home to northern Portugal's only [[Cricket]] club, the [[Oporto Cricket and Lawn Tennis Club]]. Annually, for more than 100 years, a match (the [[Kendall Cup]]) has been played between the Oporto Club and the Casuals Club of [[Lisbon]], in addition to regular games against touring teams (mainly from England). The club's pitch is located off the ''Rua Campo Alegre''.

It is one of the potential host cities for the [[2030 FIFA World Cup]].

Every year in October the Oporto [[Porto Marathon|Marathon]] is held through the streets of the old city of Porto.

===Football===
[[File:Estadio do Dragao 20050805.jpg|right|thumb|[[Estádio do Dragão]], home of [[FC Porto]]]]
[[File:Estadio do bessa.jpg|right|thumb|[[Estádio do Bessa]] XXI, home of [[Boavista F.C.|Boavista]]]]

As in most Portuguese cities, [[Association football|football]] is the most popular sport. There are two main teams in Porto: [[FC Porto]] in the parish of [[Campanhã]] in the eastern part of the city, and [[Boavista F.C.|Boavista]] in the area of Boavista in the parish of [[Ramalde]], in the western part of the city, close to the city centre. FC Porto is one of the "[[Big Three (Portugal)|Big Three]]" teams in the main Portuguese football league, and was European champion in 1987 and 2004, won the UEFA Cup (2003) and Europa League (2011) and the Intercontinental Toyota Cup in 1987 and 2004. Boavista have won the championship once, in the [[2000–01 Primeira Liga|2000–01 season]] and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup in 2003, where they lost 2–1 to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].

Formerly, [[S.C. Salgueiros|Salgueiros]] from [[Paranhos, Porto|Paranhos]] was a regular first division club during the 1980s and 1990s but, due to financial indebtedness, the club folded in the 2000s. The club was [[S.C. Salgueiros 08|refounded in 2008]] and began playing at the regional level. They now play at the third level of Portugal's national football pyramid.

The biggest stadiums in the city are FC Porto's [[Estádio do Dragão]] and Boavista's [[Estádio do Bessa]]. The first team in Oporto to own a stadium was [[Académico F.C.|Académico]], who played in the ''Estádio do Lima'', Académico was one of the eight teams to dispute the first division. Salgueiros, sold the grounds of [[Estádio Engenheiro Vidal Pinheiro]] field to the Oporto [[Porto Metro|Metro]] and planned on building a new field in the ''Arca d'Água'' area of Porto. Located a few hundred metres away from the old grounds, it became impossible to build on this plot of land due to a large underground water pocket, and, consequently, they moved to the [[Estádio do Mar]] (owned by [[Leixões S.C.]]) in the neighboring [[Matosinhos]] municipality. For the [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]] football competition, held in Portugal, the Estádio do Dragão was built (replacing the old [[Estádio das Antas]]) and the Estádio do Bessa was renovated.

===Basketball===
The [[FC Porto (basketball)|FC Porto's basketball team]] plays its home games at the [[Dragão Caixa]]. Its squad won the second most championships in the history of [[Liga Portuguesa de Basquetebol|Portugal's 1st Division]]. Traditionally, the club provides the [[Portuguese national basketball team]] with numerous key players.<ref>[https://archive.fiba.com/pages/eng/fa/team/p/sid/9318/tid/348/_/2015_EuroBasket/index.html Portugal|2015 EuroBasket] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191228210708/http://archive.fiba.com/pages/eng/fa/team/p/sid/9318/tid/348/_/2015_EuroBasket/index.html |date=28 December 2019 }}, archive.fiba.com.
