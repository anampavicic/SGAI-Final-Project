'''Matadi''' is the chief sea port of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and the capital of the [[Kongo Central]] province, adjacent to the [[Angola–Democratic Republic of the Congo border|border]] with [[Angola]]. It had a population of 245,862 (2004). Matadi is situated on the left bank of the [[Congo River]], {{convert|148|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the mouth and {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} below the last navigable point before the rapids that make the river impassable for a long stretch upriver.

==History==

[[File:108 Matadi. - Le marche.jpg|thumb|left|The market, 1899]]

Matadi was near the site of the state of [[Vungu]], which was first mentioned in 1535 <ref>Afonso I to the Pope Paulo III, 21 February 1535 in Antonio Brasio, ed. ''Monumenta Missionaria Africana'' (15 vols, Lisbon 1952-88) 2:  38.</ref> and was said to be destroyed in 1624.

Matadi itself was founded by [[Sir Henry Morton Stanley]] in 1879. It was strategically important because it was the last navigable port going upstream on the [[Congo River]]; it became the furthest inland port in the [[Congo Free State]]. The construction of the [[Matadi–Kinshasa Railway]] (built between 1890 and 1898) made it possible to transport goods from deeper within Congo's interior to the port of Matadi, stimulating the city to become an important trading center. Portuguese and French West-African commercial interests influenced the city's architecture and urban design, which borrowed from the neighboring colonies in [[Angola]] and the [[Congo-Brazzaville]].<ref>History of architecture: city, architecture and
colonial space in Matadi and Lubumbashi, Sofie Boonen,  {{cite web |url=http://symposium.fea.ugent.be/sites/symposium.elis.ugent.be/files/phdsymposium/paper450abstract_42.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-07-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714203329/http://symposium.fea.ugent.be/sites/symposium.elis.ugent.be/files/phdsymposium/paper450abstract_42.pdf |archive-date=2014-07-14 }}</ref>

== Culture ==
The word ''Matadi'' means [[stone]] in the local [[Kongo language|Kikongo]] language. The town is built on steep hills. A local saying is that to live in Matadi, you must know the verbs "to go up", "to go down", and "to sweat". Upstream is a series of caves known as the "rock of [[Diogo Cão]]", after [[graffiti]] carved by the Portuguese explorer in 1485 marking the limit of his travels up the Congo River.

[[Yelala Rapids]] lies near the city.

== Climate ==
Matadi has a relatively dry [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Aw'') with a lengthy [[dry season]] from June to September due to the northerly extension of the cold, foggy [[Benguela Current]].

The mouth of the Congo forms one of Africa's largest harbours. In addition to Matadi, which is the furthest upriver, three ports are located within it, the others being [[Boma, Congo|Boma]] and [[Banana, Congo|Banana]] in DR Congo and [[Soyo]] in [[Angola]]. Matadi serves as a major import and export point for the whole nation. Chief exports are coffee and timber.  The state fishing company "[[Pemarza]]" uses the port to supply fish to Kinshasa. [[Tshimpi Airport]] is nearby but is reportedly inactive because of continued warfare.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In Matadi there is the famous [[Matadi Bridge]], the only one along the entire lower and middle reaches of the huge [[Congo River]]. Therefore, the main transcontinental flow of cars from the vast northwestern part of Africa to the south of the African continent passes through Matadi.

Matadi Bridge, a suspension bridge 722 m- long with a main span of 520 m, built in 1983, crosses the river just south of Matadi, carrying the main road linking Kinshasa to the coast. After passing through Matadi and over the bridge, it continues to Boma, [[Muanda]] and Banana. Although built as a mixed rail and road bridge, no rail line is now operating over the bridge. Matadi is the port railhead for the 366&nbsp;km long [[Matadi-Kinshasa Railway]], constructed to bypass the rapids on the river upstream. A [[monument]] to the builders of the railway stands on a nearby hill.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

A power station on the [[M'pozo River]] supplies power to Matadi.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

== Port ==
[[File:Album Congo - Cover of trading cards from the Congo.jpg|thumb|Port of Matadi, on the cover of trading cards from the Congo]]
The maximum draft of the port is 8.2m.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.e-ships.net/ports/Congo%20(Democratic%20Republic)/1148.htm | title=E-ships.net }}</ref> The [[Navy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] maintains one operational command at the port.

Currently, larger ships are required to transfer cargo to smaller vessels in the Republic of Congo's [[Pointe-Noire]] port. For this reason, the development of a deep-sea port at [[Banana, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Port Banana]] was begun in 2022.<ref name="s&p">{{cite news |title=Construction of Banana Port begins in Congo |url=https://shipsandports.com.ng/construction-of-banana-port-begins-in-congo/ |publisher=Ships & Ports}}</ref>

In Belgium, a small [[Garden city movement|garden city]] in the [[Heverlee]] suburb of [[Leuven]] was named after Matadi in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Verbinnen |first1=Liam |title=Matadi Leuven: historische tuinwijk met bruisende gemeenschap – 21bis |url=https://21bis.be/2021/04/matadi-leuven-historische-tuinwijk-met-bruisende-gemeenschap/ |access-date=27 March 2023 |publisher=21bis |date=15 April 2021}}</ref>
