'''Bottrop''' ({{IPA|de|ˈbɔtʁɔp|-|De-Bottrop.ogg}}) is a city in west-central [[Germany]], on the [[Rhine–Herne Canal]], in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. Located in the [[Ruhr area|Ruhr industrial area]], Bottrop adjoins [[Essen]], [[Oberhausen]], [[Gladbeck]], and [[Dorsten]]. The city had been a coal-mining and rail center and contains factories producing coal-tar derivatives, chemicals, textiles, and machinery. Bottrop grew as a mining center beginning in the 1860s, was chartered as a city in 1921, and bombed during the [[Oil Campaign of World War II]]. In 1975, it unified with the neighbouring communities of Gladbeck and Kirchhellen, but Gladbeck left it in 1976, leading to Kirchhellen becoming a district of Bottrop as Bottrop-Kirchhellen. It is also twinned with [[Blackpool]], [[England]].

==Boroughs==
The total area of the municipal territory is about {{convert|101|km2|0|abbr=on}}. The longest north-south distance is {{convert|17|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and from west to east {{convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The highest peak within the city's territory is {{convert|78|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the lowest one being {{convert|26|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above sea level]].

Bottrop is divided into three boroughs: '''Bottrop-Mitte''' (Bottrop-Center), '''Bottrop-Süd''' (Bottrop South) and '''[[Bottrop#Kirchhellen|Bottrop-Kirchhellen]]''', each having a borough representation and a borough ruler.

These boroughs are further subdivided into city parts, partly named after their traditional names, while the newly built parts are only recently named:

*'''Bottrop-Mitte''': Eigen, Fuhlenbrock, Stadtmitte, and [[:de:Marktviertel (Bottrop)|Marktviertel]]
*'''Bottrop-Süd''': Batenbrock, Boy, Ebel, Lehmkuhle, Vonderort, Gartenstadt Welheim (Garden city Welheim), and Welheimer Mark 
*'''Bottrop-Kirchhellen''': Ekel, Feldhausen, Grafenwald, Hardinghausen, Holthausen, Im Loh, Kirchhellen, Kuhberg, and Overhagen

For statistical reasons, Bottrop is also divided into ''statistical'' boroughs. They are (with their official numbering):

{|
|
*11 [[Altstadt]]
*12 Nord-Ost (Northeast)
*13 Süd-West (Southwest)
*21 Fuhlenbrock-Heide (Fuhlenbrock-[[Heath (habitat)|Heath]])
*22 Fuhlenbrock-Wald (Fuhlenbrock-[[Forest]])
|
*31 Stadtwald ([[Urban forest|City forest]])
*32 Eigen
*41 Batenbrock-Nord (Batenbrock-North)
*42 Batenbrock-Süd (Batenbrock-South)
*51 Boy
*52 Welheim
|
*61 Ebel/Welheimer Mark (Ebel-Welheim Market)
*62 Süd (South)
*71 Kirchhellen-Mitte (Kirchhellen-Center)
*72 Kirchhellen-Süd/Grafenwald (Kirchhellen-South/Grafenwald)
*73 Kirchhellen-Süd-West (Kirchhellen-Southwest)
*74 Kirchhellen-Nord-Ost (Kirchhellen-Northeast)
|}

===Kirchhellen===
From 1919 until 1976, Kirchhellen was its own town. Following a communal reorganization reform in 1975, both Kirchhellen and Gladbeck joined the city of Bottrop. This resulted in the nickname "GlaBotKi". Gladbeck left the city in 1976, and became part of the district of Recklinghausen.

Most of Kirchhellen is Catholic (around 65%). It has three churches, including one Lutheran church.

===Mayor===
The current mayor of Bottrop is Bernd Tischler of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) since 2009. The most recent mayoral election was held on 13 September 2020, and the results were as follows:
