'''Montego Bay''' is the capital of the [[Parishes of Jamaica|parish]] of [[Saint James Parish, Jamaica|St. James]] in [[Jamaica]]. The city is the fourth-largest urban area in the country by population, after [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], [[Spanish Town]], and [[Portmore, Jamaica|Portmore]], all of which form the Greater Kingston Metropolitan Area, home to over half a million people.<ref>[http://statinja.gov.jm/pressreleases/pressreleasecensus.aspx Population and Housing Census 2011 Findings]</ref> As a result, Montego Bay is the second-largest [[anglophone]] city in the Caribbean, after Kingston.

Montego Bay is a popular tourist destination featuring [[duty-free]] shopping, a cruise line terminal and several beaches and resorts. The city is served by the [[Donald Sangster International Airport]], the busiest airport in the [[Anglophone Caribbean]], which is located within the official city limits. The city is enclosed in a watershed, drained by several rivers such as the Montego River.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/efiles/html/2000-038/section7l.html|title=Montego Bay Marine Park}}{{Dead link|date=September 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Montego Bay is referred to as "The Second City", "MoBay" or "Bay".

==Toponymy==
[[Christopher Columbus]] named the bay of Montego, ''Golfo de Buen Tiempo'' ("Fair Weather Gulf"). The name "Montego Bay" is believed to have originated as a corruption of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''manteca'' ("[[lard]]"), allegedly because during the Spanish period it was the port where lard, [[leather]] and [[beef]] were exported.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/jamaica/montego-bay|title=Montego Bay travel|website=Lonely Planet}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Hakewill, A Picturesque Tour of the Island of Jamaica, Plate 18.jpg|thumb|Montego Bay, c. 1820]]
[[File:Doctors-Cave-Beach.jpg|thumb|upright=1|[[Doctor's Cave Beach Club]]]]
[[File:JM-montego-bay-nat-mus.jpg|thumb|The Montego Bay Cultural Centre. The building was formerly a ballroom and courthouse during the height of the [[Colony of Jamaica|country's colonial period]]. It is also home to the [[National Gallery of Jamaica]] West.]]
[[File:Montego bay-1001.jpg|thumb|Cruise ship at Montego Bay]]
The Arawak tribe of South America are Jamaica's first known inhabitants and were there to greet Columbus when he ventured to the island in 1494.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soulofamerica.com/international/montego-bay/montego-bay-history/|title=Montego Bay History|website=soulofamerica.com}}</ref> Jamaica was a [[Spanish Empire|colony of Spain]] from 1511 until 1655, when [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s Caribbean expedition, the [[Western Design]], drove the Spanish from the island. After the British removed the Spanish rule, along with the majority of all buildings and infrastructure, the colonials established the Parish of St. James which directly influenced the area in becoming a huge contributor of sugar cane. In fact, during this period of British governing, Montego Bay was the largest producer of sugar cane on the island of Jamaica, giving the region more value than originally anticipated.<ref name="auto"/>

Throughout the duration of [[slavery]], from the mid-17th century until 1834, and well into the 20th century, the town of Montego Bay functioned primarily as a [[sugarcane]] port. The island's last major slave revolt, the Christmas Rebellion or [[Baptist War]] (1831–1832) took place in and around the area of Montego Bay. The rebellion set estates and plantations to flame and was the start of a broader political push toward emancipation.<ref name="auto"/> Retribution was quickly sought by British leaders and many were hanged for their attempts at revolt; the leader of the revolt, [[Samuel Sharpe]], was hanged there in 1832. Recognition was later given, and Sharpe was proclaimed a national hero of Jamaica in 1975, and the main square of the town was renamed in his honor. Eventually, Jamaica was emancipated on August 1, 1834 which granted all new children born or children under the age of six "free", but held individuals outside of that parameter to be apprentices and work forty hours a week in compensation to their previous or original owners. It was not until four years after these restrictions were put in place that all slave and apprentices were given the status of full freedom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamaica.loopnews.com/content/emancipation-day-jamaica|title=Emancipation Day in Jamaica &#124; Loop Jamaica|website=Loop News}}</ref> After the half decade emancipation process, Montego Bay and its sugar cane industry took a hit. Therefore, it branched out and took root in expanding into exporting bananas and coffee as well.<ref name="auto"/>

Montego Bay's city status prior to British rule was debated; however, it had its city status revoked during [[Colony of Jamaica|Jamaica's British colonial period]]. It was re-proclaimed a city by act of parliament in 1980, but this has not meant that it has acquired any form of autonomy, for it continues to be an integral part of the parish of St. James.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Montego-Bay---a-city-making-progress-in-some-areas--but-struggling-in-others_18945517 |title=Montego Bay — a city making progress in some areas, but struggling in others  |work=Jamaica Observer }}</ref>

Today, Montego Bay is known for [[Cornwall Regional Hospital]], port facilities, [[Vacation property|second homes]] for numerous upper-class Jamaicans from Kingston as well as North Americans and Europeans, fine restaurants, vibrant night life and shopping. The coastland near Montego Bay is occupied by numerous tourist resorts, most newly built, some occupying the grounds of old sugarcane [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]s with some of the original buildings and mill-works still standing. The most famous is the [[White Witch (of Rose Hall)|White Witch]]'s [[Rose Hall, Montego Bay|Rose Hall]] which features a world-class [[golf course]].

The infrastructure of the city is going through a series of modernizations which once completed, aims to keep Montego Bay as a top destination in the region. The Montego Bay Convention Centre, built on a large site near to the Rose Hall estate, was opened by Jamaican Prime Minister [[Bruce Golding]] on 7 January 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jtbonline.org/Lists/Industry%20News%20%20Facts/DispForm.aspx?ID%3D726 |title=Industry News & Facts - MONTEGO BAY CONVENTION CENTRE OPENS |access-date=2011-03-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726211439/http://www.jtbonline.org/Lists/Industry%20News%20%20Facts/DispForm.aspx?ID=726 |archive-date=26 July 2011 |publisher=Jamaican Tourist Board}}</ref>

==Demographics==
The majority of the city's population is of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African descent]]. The city is also home to sizeable minority ethnic groups such as the [[Indo-Jamaican|East Indians]] and Chinese, who came to the country as [[indentured servants]] in the mid-to-late 19th century. The Chinese especially occupy important roles in the city's economy especially in retail where Downtown Montego Bay is home to many shops and supermarkets owned by Chinese immigrants. The city's East Indian population also play a key role as they operate many gift and jewelry shops in the city which are mostly geared to tourists.<ref name="city-facts">{{Cite web |title=Montego Bay |url=https://www.city-facts.com/montego-bay |website=city-facts.com |access-date=2023-02-13}}</ref>

There is a minority of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]], some descending from immigrants from Germany (the city is a 90-minute drive from German settlements such as German Town in [[Westmoreland Parish|Westmoreland]]) and Great Britain (who own most of the land in the city from as far back as the days of the slave trade).

The city is home to many immigrants from Hispanic countries such as Mexico, Cuba and Spain as well as many French, Russians and Italians (who mostly own homes or beachfront properties in the area).

The city also is home to many Americans and Canadians, who work the tourism or [[business process outsourcing]] (BPO) industries.

==Religion==
There are a wide variety of [[Christianity|Christian]] churches in the city. Most are [[Protestantism|Protestant]], a legacy of British colonisation of the island. The chief denominations are [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)|Church of God]], [[Baptist]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], [[Methodist]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]]. Afro-Christian [[Syncretism|syncretic]] religions such as the [[Rastafari movement]] also have a significant following. The city also has a unit of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].

The city also has communities of [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Hindus]], and [[Muslims]].<ref name="city-facts"/>

==Economy==

[[File:Panorama Montego Bay.jpg|thumb|upright=1|View of the [[Caribbean Sea]] from the [[Iberostar|Iberostar Hotel and Resort]]]]
Montego Bay is pivotal to Jamaica's economy. The city holds most of the weight of the country's tourism sector. Most of the country's visitors arrive and depart from Montego Bay's airport or port. Many international companies have resorts in the city including [[Hyatt]], [[Hilton Hotels]], [[Holiday Inn]], [[RIU Hotels]], Royalton and [[Iberostar]]. The city is the home to the headquarters of international resort chain [[Sandals Resorts|Sandals]]. The Government of Jamaica, through the Ministry of Tourism, has begun to focus on bolstering the city's entertainment and gastronomic offerings. Though the city's airport hosts a number international chains, the city itself does not have access to these restaurants. The city has become home to Usain Bolt's Tracks and Records restaurant and became home to [[Starbucks]]' first Jamaican location, at Doctor's Cave Beach, in November 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stories.starbucks.com/press/2017/starbucks-opens-first-store-in-jamaica/|title=Starbucks|website=stories.starbucks.com}}</ref> The city also serves as the Head Office for Starbucks' operations in Jamaica.

===Rail===
The now disused [[Montego Bay railway station]] served the [[Railways of Jamaica: Kingston to Montego Bay|Kingston to Montego Bay]] main line. The railway station opened c. 1894,<ref>[http://www.jnht.com/heritage_site.php?id=208 Montego Bay Railway Station] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908182550/http://www.jnht.com/heritage_site.php?id=208 |date=8 September 2009 }}, Jamaica National Heritage Trust.</ref> and closed in October 1992 when all passenger traffic on Jamaica's railways abruptly ceased.<ref name="JTH18">[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3884/is_200303/ai_n9209497/pg_18 The rise and fall of railways in Jamaica, 1845-1975 - Pg18] Journal of Transport History - March 2003</ref>

===Air===
Montego Bay is served by Jamaica's largest airport, the [[Sangster International Airport]]. The airport has the distinction of being the busiest airport in the English-speaking Caribbean, serving 4.3 million passengers in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbjairport.com/history-facts|title=Facts & Statistics|publisher=Montego Bay Jamaica Airport}}</ref>

The airport was the hub of Jamaica's former national airline [[Air Jamaica]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.joc.com/montego-bay-be-hub-air-jamaica_19970612.html|title=MONTEGO BAY TO BE HUB FOR AIR JAMAICA|website=joc.com}}</ref> The airline also had its reservations, Western Jamaica sales & ticketing office, as well as its vacations division in the city until its purchase by [[Caribbean Airlines]] in 2011, when they moved their offices to [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. The site is now the headquarters for Island Routes, a company owned by the [[Adam Stewart (business executive)#Island Routes|Sandals-ATL Group]], which in the past was affiliated with the airline.

The airport is served by several North American and European airlines, connecting the island with the United States, the United Kingdom, [[Europe]] and [[South America]]. The southern U.S. city of [[Miami]] can be reached within 70 minutes. The southern U.S. cities of [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] and [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] can be reached by non-stop flights in less than three hours. Other locations like [[Philadelphia]], [[New York City]], [[Toronto]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Montreal]] can be reached in under four hours.

The airport has undergone major expansion since 2003, and has won awards including the coveted World Travel Award for being the Caribbean's Leading Airport, beating airports like [[Punta Cana International Airport]] and [[Grantley Adams International Airport]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldtravelawards.com/profile-2349-sangster-international-airport-jamaica|title=Sangster International Airport, Jamaica|website=World Travel Awards}}</ref>

===Port===
There is a [[free port]] and cruise line terminal on a man-made [[peninsula]] jutting into the bay.

==Communications==
===Fixed voice and broadband===
Fixed voice and broadband services in Montego Bay is provided by [[Flow (brand)|FLOW]]. FLOW uses a [[Hybrid fibre-coaxial|Hybrid Fibre and Coaxial]] network to provide IPTV, VoIP & POTS and cable broadband capable of speeds up to 100&nbsp;Mbit/s. FLOW also uses a Copper network to provide [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] and [[ADSL]] capable of speeds up to 12&nbsp;Mbit/s. This copper network is currently being upgraded to VDSL2, which may allow speeds of over 50 Mbit/s over existing copper lines as well as provide a migration path for the provider to [[FTTx|Fibre to the Home]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} FLOW also has a fibre-optic network in the neighbourhood of Rhyne Park which provides up to 100&nbsp;Mbit/s as well. There are several other small cable companies such as Cornwall Communications, that provides cable broadband and voice over its cable network; however, they are vastly incomparable in subscriber numbers to FLOW.{{original research inline|date=March 2019}}{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

===Mobile voice and broadband===
Mobile voice and broadband services in Montego Bay is dominated by both incumbents, [[Flow (brand)|FLOW]] & [[Digicel]]. Both carriers provide GSM, EDGE, 3G HSPA & HSPA+ connectivity in and around the city.

Currently,{{when|date=September 2024}} [[Flow (brand)|FLOW]] offers HSPA+ of up to 21&nbsp;Mbit/s on 850&nbsp;MHz and 1900&nbsp;MHz with speeds of up to 21&nbsp;Mbit/s. [[Flow (brand)|FLOW]] also offers [[LTE (telecommunications)|LTE]] data in Montego Bay. The company is the currently the only carrier to provide comprehensive LTE coverage within the city itself. Coverage also extends out towards to the adjoining rural areas surrounding Montego Bay such as Liliput to east and Hopewell (in the parish of [[Hanover Parish|Hanover]]) to the west. [[Flow (brand)|FLOW]]'s [[LTE (telecommunications)|LTE]] network uses LTE Band 4, commonly known as [[Advanced Wireless Services|AWS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegeography.com/products/commsupdate/articles/2016/01/18/flow-jamaica-begins-4g-deployment/|title=FLOW Jamaica begins 4G deployment|last=TeleGeography}}</ref> Users can avail themselves of speeds of up to 150 Mbit/s down and 50 Mbit/s up. In some areas in the city, FLOW subscribers are able to access [[LTE Advanced]] with speeds up to 225&nbsp;Mbit/s; making Montego Bay the only city in Jamaica to have access to such.

[[Digicel]], Jamaica's larger mobile network, also offers 21&nbsp;Mbit/s HSPA+; however, they also offer [[DC-HSDPA]] (commonly known as DC-HSPA+) allowing capable devices speeds of up to 42&nbsp;Mbit/s on paired 850&nbsp;MHz spectrum. [[Digicel]]'s LTE network is also available in Montego Bay, owing to its commitment to provide an islandwide [[LTE (telecommunications)|LTE]] network, offering [[LTE (telecommunications)|LTE]] in the city for its subscribers. The network is theoretically capable of speeds up to 75&nbsp;Mbit/s on 10&nbsp;MHz of Band 17 spectrum.

==In popular culture==
The city was the subject of a [[Montego Bay (song)|namesake song]] by [[Bobby Bloom]] in 1970, which became a [[Top 40|Top Ten hit]] in the United States for Bloom. It was covered by [[Jon Stevens]] in 1980 and by [[Amazulu (band)|Amazulu]] in 1986, becoming minor hits for both.

Several scenes from the 1973 [[Portrayal of James Bond in film|James Bond film]] ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' (in which [[Roger Moore]] appeared as Bond for the first time) were filmed around Montego Bay.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070328/locations|title=Live and Let Die (1973) |publisher=IMDb}}</ref>
