== History ==

===Early history===
[[File:迎恩门（齐齐哈尔）.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Gate of castle wall, Tsitsihar]]
Qiqihar is one of the oldest cities in the northeast of China. The region was originally settled by nomadic [[Daur people|Daur]] and [[Tungusic peoples|Tungus]] herdsmen. The city's original name was '''Bukui''' ({{zh|labels=no|c=卜奎}}), the Chinese transcription of a Dagur word meaning "auspicious".<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.hljxh.net/wszb/news_view.asp?id=609 |script-title=zh:齐齐哈尔自然环境|date=2006-08-25|access-date=2010-09-11|periodical=Xinhua News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721022646/http://www.hljxh.net/wszb/news_view.asp?id=609|archive-date=2011-07-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> The city's oldest mosque, the [[Bukui Mosque]], predates the foundation of the city by seven years.<ref>{{citation|date=2005-06-27|access-date=2010-09-11 |script-title=zh:卜奎清真寺|periodical=Qiqihar News|url=http://qiqihar.dbw.cn/system/2005/06/27/050067612.shtml}}</ref> During the [[Russian conquest of Siberia|Imperial Russian eastward advance to the Pacific]], Qiqihar became a major garrison center in 1674. In 1691, a stronghold was constructed in Qiqihar because the Qing government campaigned against the [[Mongol]]s.<ref>{{Cite book |script-title=zh:齐齐哈尔历史述略 |last1=Qi |first1=Xipeng (齐锡鹏) |year=1989 |publisher=Heilongjiang People's Press |isbn=978-7-207-01417-7}}</ref>

Around 1700 it was a center for [[Kyakhta trade|Russo-Chinese trade]]. A military depot with barracks and an arsenal was set up there, and many convicted criminals were exiled to the area. Heilongjiang Martial was domiciled in Qiqihar City in 1699.<ref name="Survey of the City"/> Qing China had initially intended to keep the far-northern [[Heilongjiang]] province as a semi-pastoral area, separate from the wider Chinese agricultural economy, so it did not allow seasonal urban migrants, such as those from [[Hebei]] and [[Shandong]] who wished to participate in the Qiqihar [[fur trade]], to own acres and transform the land.

After the [[Russian Empire]] seized [[Outer Manchuria]] according to the [[unequal treaty|unequal treaties]] of [[Treaty of Aigun]] and the [[Convention of Peking]], the Qing decided to lift the various restrictions it placed on [[Northeast China]] and on Heilongjiang residency in particular, in 1868, 1878, and 1904. It enlisted [[Han Chinese]] to help to teach the local [[Solon people]] farming techniques, providing materials and tax exemptions to convert them from hunting.<ref name="Shan">{{Cite journal|title=Ethnicity, Nationalism, and Race Relations: The Chinese Treatment of the Solon Tribes in Heilongjiang Frontier Society, 1900-1931|first=Patrick Fuliang|last=Shan|journal=Asian Ethnicity|volume=7|number=2| date=June 2006 |pages=185–187}}</ref> In 1903, The completion of the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] made Qiqihar a center for communications between China and Russia. A network of lines radiating from Qiqihar was extended into the northwestern part of Heilongjiang Province including [[Jiagedaqi]] and [[Manzhouli]] in the late 1920s.

===Second Sino-Japanese War===
[[File:Ma Zhanshan3.jpg|left|200px|thumb|General Ma Zhanshan]]
In 1931, Japan used a [[false flag]] attack, remembered as the [[September 18 Incident]], to justify moving its [[Guandong Army]] to capture major cities in Northeast China that month, starting with [[Shenyang]], [[Changchun]], then [[Jilin City]]. General [[Ma Zhanshan]] was ordered to act as Governor and Military Commander-in-chief of Heilongjiang Province on October 10, 1931. General Ma declined a Japanese ultimatum to surrender Qiqihar on November 15. However, after the loss in the [[Jiangqiao campaign]], the Japanese began their occupation of Qiqihar on November 19, 1931.<ref>Matsuzaka, The Making of Japanese Manchuria, 1904-1932</ref> [[Liaoning]] fell in December, and [[Harbin]] in February; the puppet [[Manchukuo]] government of the Japanese-occupied territory under General [[Zhang Jinghui]] established Qiqihar as its administrative center and of Longjiang province.

However, since Songjiang Province was merged into Heilongjiang Province, the provincial capital was transferred to [[Harbin]] in 1954. During the first five-year plan of China from 1951 to 1956, many factories including Beiman Special Steel Co. and China First Heavy Industries were aid-constructed by the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Fularji District]], making Qiqihar an important center of equipment manufacturing industry in Northeast China. In 1984, Qiqihar was designated to be one of the 13 Larger Municipalities in China by the [[General Office of the State Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ziliao.hzu.edu.cn/103313.html |script-title=zh:国务院关于批准唐山等市为"较大的市"的通知}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
