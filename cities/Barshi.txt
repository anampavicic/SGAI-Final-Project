==Bhagvant Temple==
[https://solapur.gov.in/en/tourist-place/barshi/ Bhagwant temple] is dedicated to Shri [[Vishnu]]. The uniqueness of this temple is that this is the only temple of Shri Vishnu all over India having Shri Vishnu’s name as [https://solapur.gov.in/en/gallery/barshi/ BHAGAVANT].{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

The temple was built in 1245 A.D. in Hemadpanthi style. There are four entries to the temple from all the four directions, but the main entry is east-facing.

There is one GARUDKHAMB in front of Garbhagraha. The idol of main deity Shri Bhagvant is in black stone having SHANKH, CHAKRA andGADA is in the hands and picture of devotee king Ambrish below the right hand. Shri Laxmi is on the back of Bhagvant idol. Shivlinga is there on the forehead and marks of Footsteps of Bhrigu Rishi on the chest of the deity.

There are old records showing the grants released by Shri Nanasaheb Peshve in the year 1760, by East India Company in 1823 and by British Government in 1784.

The temple management is looked after by a Panch Committee. Badves carry out the work of daily rituals of the temple. The daily rituals include Kakada Arti, Nitya Puja, Mahapuja in the morning, Dhuparti in the evening and Shejarti in the night.

A large number of devotees visit during the Chaitri, Maghi, Aashadi & kartiki (Hindu Months) [[Ekadashi]].

During the Aashadi & Kartiki Ekadashi a large procession is taken out covering the town with Bhagvant riding on Garuda. A CHABINA is taken out on every full moon day.

Every morning at five Lord Bhagawanta is woken up with the Kakad arati adorations to the accompaniment of the sound of the cymbals.  Several devotees, both men and women, attend these morning devotions. They bring the offerings of sugar, fruits, milk, curds and butter.  The traditional honour of the Kakad of Bhagawant Mandir is with Sri Dattatreya Krishnath Patil. The priest is particular about continuing this convention. It was Sri Bhaurao Tatya Patil who took up the onus of Bhagawant Kakad way back, a tradition that has been passed down the generations.

At the time of Kakad arati, the Lord is first adored with ghee lamps and then the priest changes the cloak and offerings of fruits and sugar are made.  The lotus feet of the Lord are washed with warm water. Incense is waved, milk offered in silver vessels and then a pancharati performed. After this Sri Ganapati and Varun are worshipped with blowing of conch. The priest puts a blob of butter in Lord’s mouth. Then He is anointed with milk, curds, ghee, sugar and honey. Lord Bhagawanta is given a bath with water showered out of His silver pail.  This water is considered equal in merit to Bhagirathi and sprinkled upon the devotees assembled. After this follows the karpur arati and hymns and praises are sung by the devotees.  After the Lord has bathed and put on new clothes, He is given an offering of khichadi. This is being taken care of by the local business community— Sri Nanasaheb Budukh and Sri Balasaheb Kokate are looking at this aspect presently.

In the afternoon, the Brahmins of town, Deshpande, Budukh, Joshi, Patil, Deshmukh,Mangire etc. provide the naivedya/repast for Lord Bhagawanta. The priests bring this from the homes of the respective families.  Many are the offerings made on occasions such as Gudi Padva, Dasera, Diwali etc.
