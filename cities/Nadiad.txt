It has a major [[Nadiad Junction railway station|railway junction]] and is a main station on the [[Ahmedabad–Mumbai main line|Ahmedabad-Mumbai route]]. It is the birthplace of [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], the first [[Deputy Prime Minister of India]]. Nadiad Municipality was Founded in 1866.

==History==
There is a belief that the old name of Nadiad was Natpur or Natdra, and this town was settled by the Nat people. The mostly lands and property owners in Nadiad are ‘Patel & Desai’. Indulal Yagnik wrote in his autobiography that in the last century, who would deny that Desai and Nagars had played a strange game of miraculous theatrics of politics on the stage of Mahagujarat? Below the Derasar idol of Rupa Parekh's Pol of Nadiad is the name Natiadra, which shows that the existence of Nadiad will be in the name of Natiadra in the period from 9 to 129 AD. Remains of this city have been found around Bhairavna temple on Dakor Road around AD 7. The author of 'Narsanda Darshan' has mentioned the name of Nadiad as 'Naginabad'. 
 
If the word Saksharbhoomi is heard in the ears of any Gujarati anywhere in the world, then he will understand the exact mention of Nadiad. There are nine literates here, which means that there are not as many writers in other cities as 5th Nadiad? Nadiad was becoming the center of literary and cultural activities in Gujarat in the late 19th century, i.e. between 150 and 1800 AD. In 1918, English domination was established in Gujarat and higher education of universities was started. In this way, through the connection with English education, English language and English culture, English Gujaratis, especially the Suratis, started the reform movement. At this time, Nadiad became the center for the preservation of Indian culture and heritage. In that era of kingdoms, four friends from here, Manasukhram Tripathi, Manibhai Jashbhai, Haridas Viharidas Desai (Bhau Saheb) and Ranchodram Udayaram's congregation were persecuted in many princely states from Mumbai to Kutch for their skill, study and diplomacy. [[Indulal Yagnik]] notes that taking advantage of Manasukhraya and Haridas, many Desais and citizens of Nadiad entered several states and became rich through Satadhari. In this way, the literate people of Nadiad, shining with the triple splendor of Lakshmi, Saraswati and Rajasthan, studied Indian and English culture in such a detailed manner that nowhere else in Gujarat. Thus, the protection of Arya Sanskrit is getting the pride of literacy even today as a result of the smoke which Kaj Nadiad smoked. In Nadiad, nine literates simultaneously spread their literary talents all over Gujarat. Gujarati literature has made a name for itself in world literature with the novel Saraswati Chandra by [[Govardhanram Tripathi]]. On this occasion, Manasukhram Tripathi, Zaverilal Umiyashankar Yagnik, Dolatram Kriparam Pandya, Balashankar Ullasram Kantharia, Manilal Nabhubhai Dwivedi, Chhaganlal Harilal Pandya, Ambalal Bulakhiram Jani, Champashankar Narmadashankar Pandya and Moolshankar Maneklal Yagnik were named as the nine literates of Nadiad. For this Nadiad with nine divisions, nine gates, nine lakes, Gujarat Urmikavi Nanalal has rightly said that Gujarat was looking for literacy in the whole of Nadiad.
 
More than 270 writers from Nadiad, whose birthplace, karma bhoomi or homeland have been living in this land. Perhaps in the middle class towns of Gujarat, such and such writers have not been found anywhere else. Is. Mogul Azam's popular song Pankit Mohe Nadhat Pe Nandlal Nadiad's Rasakavi Radhunath Brahmbhat has written. Nadiad is the hometown of the poet Vindhalbhai patel, who sang a lie in Bobby, a successful surgeon from Rajakpur. Gujarat's legendary comedian Bakul Tripathi, well-known poet-writer Pururaj Joshi and successful storyteller Evadev are also from Nadiad. Indulal Yagnik, Jashwant Thacker, Maganbhai Desai, D.B. Govindbhai Desai, Desaibhai Nathabhai patel, Prabodh Parikh, Pu.Mota, Mahesh Chanlal, Krishnashankar Shastri (Pu.Dadaji) are some of the creators who have gifted this land. Out of these two and a half hundred and fifty writers, 24 creators are found from the same path, while the fragrance of many other great creators is lingering in the alleys of Nadiad. Introduced in books like Nadiad's Akshardeh and A.Sau. Will be available from a permanent exhibition held at the Dahilakshmi Library.
 
Apart from literacy, Nadiad is also known as the village of Jai Maharaj. Because 150 years ago today, Dattatreya Swaru Yogiraj Avadhut Santram Maharaj lived here and spread the light of divine light. This Santram Maharaj has composed the best poems of Gyanbhakti under the name of Sukhsagar and many other poets of his saintly life have also given the best poems.
