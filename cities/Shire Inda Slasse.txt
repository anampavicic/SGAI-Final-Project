'''Shire''' ({{Langx|ti|ሽረ}}, {{transliteration|ti|Shuh-ruh}}; {{Langx|am|ሽሬ}}, {{transliteration|am|Shuh-ré}}), also known as '''Shire Inda Selassie''' ({{Langx|ti|ሽረ እንዳ ሥላሴ}}, meaning "House of the [[Trinity]]"), is a city and separate [[Districts of Ethiopia|woreda]] in the [[Tigray Region]] of [[Ethiopia]]. The city is the administrative center of the [[Shire Awraja, Mi erabawi Zoba and now Semien Mi'irabawi Zone]].<ref>At least in 1998, per [http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Hornet/tigray01.html EUE: Tigray Evacuees, 12/98] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114174052/http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Hornet/tigray01.html |date=2007-11-14 }}</ref> It was part of [[Tahtay Koraro]] district.

== History ==

=== Origin ===
An early mention of Shire is in one of the three surviving charters of Emperor [[Dawit I]] (r. 1382–1412).<ref>[[G.W.B. Huntingford]], ''The Historical Geography of Ethiopia from the first century AD to 1704'' (London: The British Academy, 1989), p. 82</ref><ref>Smidt W (2003) Cartography, in: Uhlig S (ed.): Encyclopaedia Aethiopica, Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, vol. 1: 688-691</ref>

=== 16th century ===
The metropolis was a tributary state of  [[Adal (historical region)|Adal]] and governed by the [[Christian]], Diganah.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chekroun |first1=Amélie |title=Le" Futuh al-Habasa" : écriture de l'histoire, guerre et société dans le Bar Sa'ad ad-din (Ethiopie, XVIe siècle). |publisher=l’Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne |page=336 |url=https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01134623/document |access-date=2022-12-31 |archive-date=2022-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220928123642/https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01134623/document |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== 20th century ===
As part of the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], Italian units under General [[Pietro Badoglio]] advanced out of [[Axum]] on 29 February 1936 to attack the Ethiopian army under ''Ras'' [[Imru Haile Selassie]] deployed around Shire in an action known as the [[Battle of Shire (1936)|Battle of Shire]]. Despite determined Ethiopian resistance, by 3 March the Italians had resumed their advance and shortly afterwards crossed the [[Tekezé River]].

After the restoration of the monarchy in 1941, Shire served as the capital of the Shire sub-region until the administrative reorganization of the nation following the adoption of the [[1995 Ethiopian Constitution]].

Shire once again became a battlefield during the [[Ethiopian Civil War]]. The first clash of the [[Tigrayan People's Liberation Front]] (TPLF) with government forces occurred on 5 August 1975, after Mehari Tekle ("Mussie"), a member of the TPLF leadership, was arrested in Addi Daero by government militiamen and taken to prison in Shire. Before he could be transported to a more secure facility in [[Mek'ele]] or [[Addis Ababa]], a squad of eleven men burst into the prison, wounding one policeman and scattering the rest, freeing their comrade and 60 other prisoners, and spiriting him away to safety.<ref>Aregawi Berhe, ''A Political history of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (1975-1991)'' (Los Angeles: Tsehai, 2009), pp. 76f. (Aregawi states in a footnote that he was a member of the eleven-man squad.)</ref>

During the latter part of the war, following the massive Ethiopian army defeat at the [[Battle of Afabet]] in March 1988, the TPLF launched a series of offensives, in which they destroyed government forces stationed at [[Rama, Ethiopia|Rama]], [[Adwa]], [[Seleh Leha]], and Shire. Only about 200 soldiers of the 17th Army Division were able to evacuate Shire and fall back to [[Gondar]]. This led to the raising of the Third Revolutionary Army, composed of the 603rd, 604th and 605th core armies. Between 19 June and 3 July 1988 the 604th was able to regain control over 12 districts, and entered Shire with no significant resistance from TPLF forces. However, due to unrest amongst the government soldiers at Addi Hageray, which permitted the TPLF to attack and occupy that town, the 604th was unable to advance again until 28 December. This led to the Second [[Battle of Shire (1989)|Battle of Shire]], which ended on 19 February 1989 as a victory for the TPLF. Although Shire had been the headquarters of the Third Revolutionary Army at the beginning of the battle, at the end the remaining units were retreating towards Enda Aba Guna.<ref>Tekeste Melake, [http://www.ethiopianreview.com/content/4596 "The Battle of Shire"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107064459/http://www.ethiopianreview.com/content/4596 |date=2009-01-07 }}, ''Ethiopian Review'', 24 September 2008 (accessed 30 July 2009)</ref> On 21 March 1989, Shire was bombed from the air by the [[Ethiopian Air Force]]: one person was killed.<ref>Human Rights Watch, 24 July 1991: [https://www.hrw.org/reports/archives/africa/ETHIOPIA907.htm ETHIOPIA - "Mengistu has Decided to Burn Us like Wood" - Bombing of Civilians and Civilian Targets by the Air Force] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220407002049/https://www.hrw.org/reports/archives/africa/ETHIOPIA907.htm |date=2022-04-07 }}</ref>
The third edition of ''[[Lonely Planet]]'' guide to Ethiopia notes that "war relics" could still be seen near Shire.<ref>Matt Philips and Jean-Bernard Carillet, ''Ethiopia and Eritrea'', third edition (n.p.: Lonely Planet, 2006), p. 131</ref>

About ten percent of the children were diagnosed (by arm measurements) as having severe acute malnutrition. The [[DX Open Network]], based in the UK and analysing satellite images, found that two warehouse-style structures in the UN [[World Food Program]] compound at Hitsats refugee camp had been "very specifically destroyed." [[Doctors Without Borders]] found that in the parts of Adigrat, Adwa and Axum that they had access to, in other parts of Tigray Region, the civilian casualties were "extremely high".<ref>{{cite news |title='Extreme urgent need': Starvation haunts Ethiopia's Tigray |url=https://apnews.com/article/ethiopia-united-nations-kenya-ef0b6b2db2994d4c3042cf19f3d92a2a |access-date=17 January 2021 |work=AP NEWS |date=17 January 2021 |archive-date=17 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210117090044/https://apnews.com/article/ethiopia-united-nations-kenya-ef0b6b2db2994d4c3042cf19f3d92a2a |url-status=live }}</ref>
