Today's Tsuruoka is the result of the fusion of several neighborhoods around the center of the city such as Atsumi, Asahi, Fujishima, Kushibiki, and Haguro in 1953.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.city.tsuruoka.lg.jp/shisei/gaiyo/soumu-gaiyouenkaku.html|script-title=ja:鶴岡市の沿革 鶴岡市|last=City|first=Tsuruoka|website=www.city.tsuruoka.lg.jp|language=ja|access-date=2017-11-13}}</ref>

==Geography==
Tsuruoka is located on the coast of Yamagata Prefecture bordering the [[Sea of Japan]] and has some locally popular beaches such as Yunohama and Sanze. All three of the [[Three Mountains of Dewa]] are at least partially within the city limits.

Two main rivers run through Tsuruoka, the Akagawa River (赤川, literally "Red River"), and the [[Mogami River]].

===Climate===
Tsuruoka has a [[Humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa'') with large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. Precipitation is significant throughout the year but is heaviest from August to October. The average annual temperature in Tsuruoka is {{cvt|12.9|C}}. The average annual rainfall is {{cvt|2191.4|mm}} with December as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around {{cvt|25.3|C}}, and lowest in January, at around {{cvt|1.7|C}}.<ref name="normals"/> The region is known for its heavy snowfalls during the winter, and people living in Sekigawa and Atsumi's neighborhoods can expect up to 2 meters of snow which after removal creates very particular snow walls standing high along the road. The first snows usually come in late November but the real peak is generally around January. The red leaves appear generally at the end of October and end in mid-November.

==History==
The area of present-day Tsuruoka was part of ancient [[Dewa Province]]. In the [[Edo period]], it served as the capital of the [[Shōnai Domain]]. It was a minor port for the ''[[kitamaebune]]'' coastal trade.
 
After the start of the [[Meiji period]], the area organized as Tsuruoka Town under [[Nishitagawa District, Yamagata|Nishitagawa District]], Yamagata Prefecture in 1878. It was elevated to city status on October 1, 1924, becoming Japan's 100th city. In 1955, the city expanded by annexing the town of Kamo and nine neighboring villages. The town of Oyama was annexed by Tsuruoka in 1963.

=== The Mountain Spirit ===
Tsuruoka is mostly known for its "[[Three Mountains of Dewa]]", which refers to [[Mount Haguro|Mt. Haguro]], the smallest mount that culminates at only 436m high; [[Mount Gassan|Mt. Gassan]], the highest mount at 1984m; and [[Mount Yudono|Mt. Yudono]], at 1500m.

==== Yamabushi and Shugendô ====

Those three mounts are considered the core of the Shugendô practice. [[Shugendō|Shugendô]] (修験道, lit. ''The way of the ascetic practice'') is often perceived as a form of syncretism of [[Shinto|Shintô]] and Buddhism. The ''[[Yamabushi]]'' (山伏, lit. "the men who sleep in the Mountain"), or men who practice ''shugendô'', believe in Buddha but also believe that a god resides in all things that exist in nature. Yamabushi wear checkered vests and blow trumpet shells to communicate with their peers and to keep the bad spirits away. They aim to protect the mountain and to live a sinless life connected to nature.<ref>{{cite web |title=修験道とは …「自然と人間」 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201221152905/http://www.tendai-jimon.jp/trainee/index.html |publisher=Tendaijimon Sect. |access-date=9 September 2024}}</ref>

The pilgrimage of all three mountains is done in that sense. The three mountains symbolically represent death and rebirth. By going down and up the 2466 stone stairs of Mt. Haguro, people can experience a symbolic "death" and "rebirth", after which they can access to the world of the dead represented by Mt. Gassan and its foggy landscapes; lastly, they can purify their body and soul in Mt. Yudono's natural hotsprings. 
[[File:Shojin ryori.png|thumb|270x270px|Shôjin ryôri at Saikan (Mt. Haguro)]]
''[[Shōjin ryōri|Shôjin ryôri]]'' (精進料理, lit. "food for spiritual elevation"), a vegan food traditionally consumed by Yamabushi, uses no animal product but ''sansai'' 山菜 ("Mountain vegetables") instead, as well as local rice, handmade ''gomadôfu'' (sesame-flavoured tôfu), bamboo sprouts, vinegared chrysanthemum flowers and mushrooms. There exists many different types of ''shôjin ryôri'' depending on the [[shukubo]] (temples that also welcome travellers for the night) that serves it, but it usually consists of many small dishes accompanied with miso soup and white rice.

==== National Treasures ====
Mt. Haguro hosts The Five-Storied Pagoda (''gojûnotô'' 五重塔), one of Japan's National Treasures. The pagoda's central pillar protects it from earthquakes, which inspired Tokyo's [[Tokyo Skytree|Skytree]]'s architecture. Also in the grounds of Mt. Haguro is the Jiji-sugi 爺杉 ("Grandpa cedar"), a 30m high cedar that exists for more than 1000 years.

===Culinary culture===
==== Heritage and creativity ====
In 2014, Tsuruoka has been registered as a UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy. Its more than 50 species of "ancestral food" (''zairai sakumotsu'' 在来作物) that exist and remain intact for several centuries now are one of the reasons why the city has received this title. Among these there are: ''minden nasu'' 民田なす (a round eggplant with a long and thin hat), {{transl|ja|karatori imo}} からとりいも (spiciness-sweetener potato), {{transl|ja|atsumi kabu}} 温海かぶ (Atsumi turnip, a red turnip that grows on sharp slopes), ''ootaki carrot'' 大滝ニンジン,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tsuruoka UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy|pages=69–70}}</ref> etc. The presence of such ancient food is not the only reason why Tsuruoka has been registered as a Creative City of Gastronomy. Its particular way to cook these ingredients was even more determinant. Tsuruoka's most known specialties are: ''kandarajiru'' 寒鱈汁 (a soup containing black cod fished during the winter – the period when it is supposed to be tastier), ''gomadôfu'' ごま豆腐 (sesame-flavoured tôfu), ''tochimochi'' とちもち (chestnut flavoured pound rice cake), ''kitsunemen'' キツネ面 (fox mask shaped black sugar biscuit), etc.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tsuruoka Creative city of Gastronomy|pages=55}}</ref>

The city is also known for its large variety of soups (it is said the harsh cold during the winter is the reason why there are so many types of hot soups in Tsuruoka),<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tsuruoka Creative city of Gastronomy|pages=59}}</ref> apart from ''kandarajiru'', there is ''takenokojiru'' タケノコ汁 (Mt Gassan bamboo soup), ''imoni'' 芋煮 (potato soup), ''nattôjiru'' 納豆汁 (nattô based soup), ''môsô jiru'' (another type of bamboo soup).

==== Peas ====
Tsuruoka is known for {{transl|ja|dadacha-mame}} (だだちゃ豆), a species of [[soybean]], which have been called "the king of [[edamame]]"; they are also used for other products such as [[nattō]] and in [[manjū]]. There are two theories as to the origin of the name: one is that it derives from {{transl|ja|dadacha}}, the Shonai dialectical word for "father" – {{transl|ja|gagacha}} is the dialectical word for "mother", while the other is that the beans came from [[Date, Fukushima]], and were originally called {{transl|ja|Date-no-chamame}}, which became {{transl|ja|Date-chamame}} and then {{transl|ja|Dadacha-mame}}.<ref>[http://www.yamagatakanko.com/english/interesting_information_series/yamagata_foods/dadacha.html Yamagata foods: Dadacha-mame]</ref>

{{transl|ja|Dadachamame}} are used in any kind of meal: sweet, salty, spicy, bitter, sour, just boiled, crushed, grilled, and in sauces.

''Dadakko'' (だだっ子), are small cakes which contain a sweet {{transl|ja|dadachamame}} paste. ''Dadappai (''だだっパイ) are small {{transl|ja|dadachamame}} pasted inside a puff pastry. There are also {{transl|ja|dadachamame}} flavored ice creams, cookies, biscuits, creams.

==== Seafood ====
Tsuruoka and the whole region of Shônai benefit from a large variety of fishes and sea food coming from the [[Sea of Japan]]. Among all the local sea foods you can find in Tsuruoka, there are: [[Cherry Salmon|Cherry salmon]], [[Japanese seabream]], [[Portunus trituberculatus|blue crab]], [[littlemouth flounder]], flatfish, [[black rockfish]], [[tonguefish]], [[Ommastrephidae|flying squid]], oyster, [[Triglidae|sea robin]], [[Arctoscopus japonicus|sandfish]], [[Cod|Japanese codfish]], and others. The huge variety of fresh local fishes and seafood in Tsuruoka had contributed to the local sushi shops' good reputation, but it has also helped constitute a very particular kind of "family gastronomy", where fishes hold a very important place.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tsuruoka UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy|page=70}}</ref>

==== Rice ====
The rice cultivated in Tsuruoka and more generally in Shonai region has been recognized for its strong [[Umami|umami taste]]. In 2010, searchers from Keiô University's Institute for Advanced Biosciences 慶應義塾大学先端生命科学研究所 have proven Tsuyahime local rice brand contained 1.5x more umami taste than the common other brands of rice thanks to the studies of [[metabolome]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iab.keio.ac.jp/news-events/2010/10181622.html|title=朝日新聞 10/19 「つや姫のうまさ、秘密は「バランス」 慶応大など研究」}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mugendai-web.jp/archives/1229|title=「メタボローム解析」が拓く未来の健診――わずかな唾液や血液、尿の検査で、すい臓がんからうつ病まで一挙に早期発見する}}</ref>

=== Arts and crafts ===
The city is literally surrounded by plains, forests and mountains. Thus, wood and grass were largely used in all kinds of crafts. As for architecture, thatch-roofed houses (''kayabukiyane'' かやぶき屋根) are one of the symbols of the city. Some of them remained in good condition through centuries now as for example ''Tasôminka'' 多層民家 (the several-layered house), a traditional farmer house from Meiji period, and the house in Chidô Museum 致道博物館.

Concerning clothing, ''shinaori'' しな織り, is a traditional weaving style from tree bark that is still performed these days. The items created with this solid and firm thread are very resistant and waterproof.
