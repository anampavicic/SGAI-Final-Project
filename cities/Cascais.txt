Its [[Cascais Marina|marina]] hosts events such as the [[America's Cup]] and the town of [[Estoril]], part of the Cascais municipality, hosts conferences such as the [[Horasis Global Meeting]].

Cascais's history as a popular seaside resort originated in the 1870s, when King [[Luís I of Portugal]] and the [[House of Braganza|Portuguese royal family]] made the seaside town their residence every September, thus also attracting members of the [[Portuguese nobility]], who established a summer community there. Cascais is known for the many members of royalty who have lived there, including King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom]], when he was the Duke of Windsor, King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]], and King [[Umberto II of Italy]]. Exiled Cuban president [[Fulgencio Batista]] was also once a resident of the municipality. The [[Casino Estoril]] inspired [[Ian Fleming]]'s first [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]] novel, [[Casino Royale (novel)|''Casino Royale'']].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/travel/europe/alternative-algarve-1.1276923|title=Alternative Algarve|date=8 January 2011|work=Irish Times|access-date=13 September 2019}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:33037-Cascais (35538412783).jpg|thumb|left|Coast view of Cascais, Portugal.]]
Human settlement of the territory today known as Cascais dates to the late [[Paleolithic]], as indicated by remnants encountered in the north of Talaíde, in Alto do Cabecinho (Tires) and south of Moinhos do Cabreiro.<ref name="CMHistoria">{{cite web |editor=Câmara Municipal |publisher=Câmara Municipal de Cascais |location=Cascais, Portugal |year=2011 |access-date=8 March 2013 |language=pt |url=http://www.cm-cascais.pt/sub-area/historia |title=História |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313073116/http://www.cm-cascais.pt/sub-area/historia |archive-date=13 March 2013 }}</ref> It was during the [[Neolithic]] that permanent settlements were established in the region, their inhabitants utilizing the natural grottoes (such as the [[Caves of Poço Velho]] in Cascais) and artificial shelters (like those in [[Artificial caves of Alapraia|Alapraia]] or São Pedro) to deposit their dead. The bodies were buried along with offerings, a practice that continued to the [[Chalcolithic]].<ref name=CMHistoria/>

Roman interventions in the area occurred with the settlement of the ''villae'' of [[Roman villa of Freiria|Freiria]] (today São Domingos de Rana) and [[Roman ruins of Casais Velhos|Casais Velhos]] (Charneca), evidence for which includes a group of ten tanks discovered along the ''Rua Marques Leal Pancada'' in Cascais, which was the location of a salting factory for fish.<ref name=CMHistoria/> Roman dominion over the territory also influenced place names in the region, as was the case with the word "Caparide" (from the Latin ''capparis'', meaning "''[[caper]]''"), as well as several inscriptions associated with funerary graves.<ref name=CMHistoria/>

The [[Visigoths]] also left their mark especially on the Visigothic Cemetery of Alcoitão,<ref>{{cite web |title=Cemitério visigótico de Alcoitão |url=http://www.patrimoniocultural.gov.pt/pt/patrimonio/patrimonio-imovel/pesquisa-do-patrimonio/classificado-ou-em-vias-de-classificacao/geral/view/73236 |website=www.patrimoniocultural.gov.pt |access-date=13 May 2021}}</ref> as well as in the late-Roman and medieval necropolis of Talaíde.<ref>{{cite book |last1=d'Encarnação |first1=José |title=História e geografia de Cascais |date=1979 |publisher=Cascais: Publigráfica |url=https://biblioteca.cascais.pt/bibliotecadigital/129022/129022_0000_Obra%20completa_t24-C-R0300.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cardoso |first1=J.L |last2=Cardoso |first2=G. |last3=Guerra |first3=M.

Similarly, Muslim settlers in the region left their mark on local place names, including "Alcoitão" and "Alcabideche", where the romantic poet Ibn Muqana al-Qabdaqi, who wrote of the region's agriculture and windmills, was born at the beginning of the 11th century.<ref name=CMHistoria/> The discovery of several corpses in 1987 at Arneiro, in [[Carcavelos]], led to the identification of fifteen burials that, due to their characteristics, made it possible to verify that the individuals buried there were of [[Berbers|Berber]] origin.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cardoso |first1=Guilherme |last2=d'Encarnação |first2=José |title=Património Arqueológico |date=2010 |publisher=Câmara Municipal de Cascais |location=Cascais |pages=61–62 |url=https://biblioteca.cascais.pt/bibliotecadigital/DG16/DG16_item1/DG16_PDF/DG16_PDF_24-C-R0150/DG16_ObraCompleta_t24-C-R0150.pdf |isbn=978-972-637-225-7 |access-date=13 May 2021}}</ref>

The development of Cascais began in earnest in the 12th century, when it was administratively subordinate to the town of [[Sintra]], located to the north. In its humble beginnings, Cascais depended on the products of the sea and land, but by the 13th century its fish production was also supplying the nearby city of [[Lisbon]]. The toponym "''Cascais''" appears to derive from this period, a plural derivation of ''cascal'' (''monte de cascas'') which signified a "mountain of shells", referring to the abundant volume of marine mollusks harvested from the coastal waters.<ref name=CMHistoria/> During the 14th century, the population spread outside the walls of its [[Citadel of Cascais|fortress castle]].

[[File:Walking around Cascais (49663277256).jpg|thumb|left|Center of Cascais ([[Peter I of Portugal|King Peter I]] statue).]]
The settlement's prosperity led to its administrative independence from Sintra in 1364. On 7 June 1364, the people of Cascais obtained from [[Peter I of Portugal|King Peter I]] the elevation of the village to the status of town, necessitating the appointment of local judges and administrators. The townspeople were consequently obligated to pay the Crown 200 pounds of gold annually, as well as bearing the expense of paying the local administrators' salaries. Owing to the regions' wealth, these obligations were easily satisfied.<ref name=CMHistoria/> The town and the surrounding lands were owned by a succession of feudal lords, the most famous of whom was [[João das Regras]] (died 1404), a lawyer and professor of the [[University of Coimbra|University of Lisbon]] who was involved in the ascension of [[John I of Portugal|King John I]] to power as the first King of the [[House of Aviz]].

The castle of Cascais was likely constructed during this period, since by 1370, King [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Ferdinand]] had donated the castle and Cascais to Gomes Lourenço de Avelar to hold as a seigneurial fiefdom.<ref name=CMHistoria/> These privileges were then passed on to his successors, among them João das Regras and the Counts of Monsanto, and later the Marquess of Cascais.<ref name=CMHistoria/> Meanwhile, despite its conquest and sack by [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] forces in 1373, and blockade of the port in 1382 and 1384, Cascais continued to grow beyond its walls.<ref name=CMHistoria/> By the end of the 14th century this resulted in the creation of the [[parish]]es of Santa Maria de Cascais, [[Alcabideche|São Vicente de Alcabideche]] and [[São Domingos de Rana]].<ref name=CMHistoria/>

[[File:Braun Cascais UBHD.jpg|thumb|left|A 1572 sketch of the coast of Cascais.]]
From the [[Middle Ages]] onward, Cascais depended on fishing, maritime commerce (it was a stop for ships sailing to Lisbon), and agriculture, producing [[wine]], [[olive oil]], cereals, and fruits. Due to its location at the mouth of the [[Tagus]] estuary, it was also seen as a strategic post in the defence of Lisbon. Around 1488, [[John II of Portugal|King John II]] built a small fortress in the town, situated by the sea. On 15 November 1514, [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] conceded a [[foral]] (''charter'') to Cascais, instituting the region's municipal authority.<ref name="CMHistoria"/> It was followed on 11 June 1551 by a license from [[John III of Portugal|King John III]] to institutionalise the ''Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Cascais''.<ref name=CMHistoria/> The [[Mother Church]] of Cascais, the [[Church of Nossa Senhora da Assunção (Cascais)|Church of Nossa Senhora da Assunção]], dates back to the early 16th century. The town's medieval fortress was inadequate to repel invasions, and in 1580 Spanish troops led by the Duque of Alba took the village during the conflict that led to the [[Struggle for the throne of Portugal|union of the Portuguese and Spanish crowns]]. The fortress was enlarged towards the end of the 16th century by [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip I]] (Philip II of Spain), turning it into a typical [[Renaissance]] [[citadel]] with the characteristic flat profile and star-shaped [[floorplan]]. Following the Portuguese restoration in 1640, a dozen bulwarks and redoubts were constructed under the direction of the [[Count of Cantanhede]], who oversaw the defences of the Tagus estuary, the gateway to the city of Lisbon.<ref name=CMHistoria/> Of these structures, the [[citadel of Cascais]], which was constructed alongside the fortress of Our Lady of Light, considerably reinforced the strategic defences of the coast.<ref name=CMHistoria/>
[[File:GuimaraesPalace.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Palácio dos Condes de Castro Guimarães]] in Cascais, Portugal.]]

In 1755, the great [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|Lisbon earthquake]] destroyed a large portion of the city. Around 1774, the [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal|Marquis of Pombal]], prime-minister of [[José I of Portugal|King José I]], took protective measures for the commercialisation of the wine of [[Carcavelos]] and established the Royal Factory of Wool in the village, which existed until the early 19th century. During the [[Invasion of Portugal (1807)|invasion of Portugal by Napoleonic troops]] in 1807, the citadel of Cascais was occupied by the [[French people|French]], with [[Andoche Junot|General Junot]] staying some time in the village.

In 1862, the [[Joaquim António Velez Barreiros|Visconde da Luz]] built a summer house in Cascais. He and a group of friends also organized the construction of a road from Cascais to [[Oeiras, Portugal|Oeiras]], effectively linking Cascais to Lisbon, and also promoted other improvements to the town. As a result of these improvement, [[Luís I of Portugal|King Luís I]] decided to make Cascais into his summer residence and, from 1870 to 1908, the Portuguese royal family from the [[House of Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] spent part of the summer in Cascais to enjoy the sea, turning the quiet fishing village into a cosmopolitan address. Thanks to King Luís, the citadel was equipped with the country's first [[electric light]]s in 1878. Cascais also benefited from the construction of a better road to Sintra, a [[bullring|bullfight ring]], a [[Sporting Club of Cascais|sports club]], and improvements to basic infrastructure for the population. Many noble families built impressive mansions in an eclectic style commonly referred to as ''[[summer architecture]]'', many of which are still to be seen in the town centre and environs. The first railway arrived in 1889. Another important step in the development of the area was made in the first half of the 20th century with the building of a casino and infrastructure in neighbouring [[Estoril]].
[[File:Cascais Conde Castro Guimaraes.jpg|thumb|left|[[Condes de Castro Guimarães Museum]]]]

In 1882 Cascais installed one of the first [[Cascais tide gauge|tide gauges]] in Europe in order to assist with navigation into the port of Lisbon. In 1896, [[Carlos I of Portugal|King Carlos I]], a lover of all maritime activities, installed in the citadel the first oceanographic laboratory in Portugal. The King himself led a total of 12 scientific expeditions to the coast; these ended in 1908 after his [[Lisbon Regicide|assassination in Lisbon]].

Due to Portugal's [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] in World War II and the town's elegance and royal past, Cascais became home to many of the exiled royal families of Europe, including those of Spain ([[House of Bourbon]]), Italy ([[House of Savoy]]), Hungary and Bulgaria. Their stories are told at the [[Exiles Memorial Centre]].

Nowadays, Cascais and its surroundings are a popular vacation spot for the Portuguese as well as for the international [[jet set]] and regular foreign tourists, all of them drawn by its fine beaches. The town hosts many international events, including sailing and surfing. In 2018 it was the [[European Youth Capital]].

Cascais is situated on the western edge of the Tagus estuary, between the Sintra mountains and the Atlantic Ocean; the territory occupied by the municipality is limited in the north by the municipality of [[Sintra Municipality|Sintra]], south and west by the ocean, and east by the municipality of [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]].<ref name=CMHistoria/>

Administratively, the municipality is divided into 4 civil parishes (''[[freguesia (Portugal)|freguesias]]''),<ref>{{cite web|title=Law nr. 11-A/2013, page 552 30|url=http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2013/01/01901/0000200147.pdf |access-date=20 July 2014|author=[[Diário da República]]|language=pt}}</ref> with municipal authority vested in the ''Câmara Municipal'' of Cascais:
* [[Alcabideche]]
* [[Carcavelos e Parede]]
* [[Cascais e Estoril]]
* [[São Domingos de Rana]]

Cascais' coastline is home to 17 beaches.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ambiente.cascais.pt/pt/espacos/praias|title=Beaches of Cascais - Cascais Municipality Website|date=2018|website=Praias {{!}} Cascais Ambiente}}</ref> These are:

[[Praia do Guincho|Guincho Beach]] and Carcavelos Beach are especially well known as good surf spots. Close to Praia do Guincho is the [[Cresmina Dune]], which is an unstable dune system due to the constant drifting of sand particles caused by strong winds.

===Climate===
Cascais has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csb'') with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Moderated by the [[Atlantic]] and the typical [[urban heat island]] of a city, temperatures in Cascais rarely get below {{convert|5|C}} or above {{convert|30|C}}.

Cascais is easily reached from Lisbon by car on the A5 Lisbon-Cascais highway, or alternatively on the scenic "marginal" road, as well as by frequent inexpensive commuter trains. Taxis are also a common and inexpensive mode of transport in the area. The city has the ruins of a [[Citadel of Cascais|castle]], an [[Casa das Histórias Paula Rego|art]] museum and an [[Museum of the Sea, Cascais|ocean museum]], as well as parks and the cobbled streets of the historic centre. The town has many hotels and tourist apartments as well as many good restaurants of varying cost. It is a fine base to use for those visiting Lisbon and its environs who prefer to stay outside of the city.

Cascais ranks 9th in population density and 6th in percentage of population employed among Portuguese municipalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cascaisinvest.pt/en/cascais/|title=Cascais|publisher=Cascais Invest: economic promotion and investment unit|access-date=2018-06-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713020547/https://www.cascaisinvest.pt/en/cascais/|archive-date=2018-07-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Cascais is surrounded by popular beaches. [[Guincho Beach]] to the northwest is primarily a [[surfing]], [[windsurfing]], and [[kitesurfing]] beach because of the prevailing winds and sea swells, while the calm waters of the beaches to the east attract sunbathers. The lush [[Sintra-Cascais Natural Park|Sintra]] mountains to the north are a further attraction. The shoreline to the west has cliffs, attracting tourists who come for the panoramic views of the sea and other natural sights such as the [[Boca do Inferno]]. It is also becoming a popular golf destination, with over 10 [[Golf|golf courses]] nearby.

A large [[Cascais Marina|marina]] with 650 berths was opened in 1999 and has since held many sailing events. It was the official host of the [[2007 ISAF Sailing World Championships]] for dinghies and racing yachts. The municipality also hosts international [[tennis]] and motorcycling events and for many years hosted the [[FIA]] F1 Portugal Grand Prix at the [[Autódromo Fernanda Pires da Silva|Estoril race track]]. The [[Casino Estoril|Estoril Casino]] is one of the largest in Europe. Near the casino is the ''"Hotel Palácio"'' (Palace Hotel), where scenes of the [[James Bond]] movie ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' were shot.

In 2017 the municipality started charging a small tourist tax, as the city had become one of the most visited destinations in Portugal. It is estimated that around 1.2 million tourists stay in the city's hotels each year (2016).<ref>{{cite web |title=Taxa turística de um euro cobrada em Cascais a partir de hoje |url=https://www.dn.pt/dinheiro/interior/taxa-turistica-de-um-euro-cobrada-em-cascais-a-partir-de-hoje-5640807.html |publisher=Diário de Notícias |access-date=1 February 2017}}</ref>

==Culture==

The [[Teatro Gil Vicente, Cascais|Gil Vicente theatre]] dates back to 1869. In its early years it was frequently attended by Portugal's royal family. The Cascais Experimental Theatre was established in 1965 and has presented more than a hundred shows since then. Over the years Cascais has developed several art galleries and museums. These are concentrated in a relatively small area of the town, mainly in parkland. Combined, they are known as The Museum Quarter.<ref>{{cite web|title=Museum Quarter|url=http://www.visitcascais.com/en/museum-quarter/list|publisher=Visit Cascais|access-date=31 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201075359/http://www.visitcascais.com/en/museum-quarter/list|archive-date=1 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Several occupy large buildings that were formerly private residences and were subsequently taken over and restored by the Municipality. Entrance is either free or for a small fee (usually not more than €4). The galleries and museums are:
