==History==
[[File:Iglesia deSanta Gertrudis-Envigado.jpg|thumb|left|{{Ill|Iglesia de Santa Gertrudis|es|Iglesia de Santa Gertrudis (Envigado)}}]]

Envigado was founded in 1775 and was declared a municipality in 1814. The founders were José Antonio Isaza y Atuesta, Lucas de Ochoa y Tirado, and Vicente Restrepo.

Some researchers suggest that its name comes from the large trees that were once found there and which were used for the rafters (''vigas'') in constructing houses.

Spaniards in search of gold arrived in the [[Aburrá Valley]] for the first time in August of the year 1541. They left only a month after to continue their quest for gold, but returned 90 years later, at the beginning of the 17th century, to stay.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.envigado.gov.co/AsiesEnvigado/Paginas/AsiesEnvigado.aspx |title=.:Envigado:. |website=www.envigado.gov.co |access-date=2016-04-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428173520/http://www.envigado.gov.co/AsiesEnvigado/Paginas/AsiesEnvigado.aspx |archive-date=2016-04-28 }}</ref>

The rural Envigado was inhabited by wealthy Spanish families, which lived in prosperous residences that produced nourishment for [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] for about 150 years.

The urban Envigado only appeared after 1775 with the creation of the Santa Gertrudis Parish, which is now in the center of Downtown Envigado known as "El Parque de Envigado."

On July 10, 2016 Envigado became part of the Metropolitan Area, which brings together the other nine municipalities of the region - Caldas, La Estrella, Sabaneta, Itagüí, Medellín, Bello, Copacabana, Girardota, Barbosa.
