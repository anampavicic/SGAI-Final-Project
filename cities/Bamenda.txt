==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Zicht op een straat en de huizen van Bamenda TMnr 20014196.jpg|thumb|left|Bamenda, 1965]]

===Colonial era===
The origins of the city are related to the settlement of the [[Tikar people]] who culturally forged and maintained relations with the [[Kingdom of Bamum]] in the 1700s.<ref>Toyin Falola, Daniel Jean-Jacques, ''Africa: An Encyclopedia of Culture and Society [3 volumes]: An Encyclopedia of Culture and Society'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2015, p. 142</ref> In 1884, the city was colonized by [[Germany]] until 1916 when it became a colony administered by [[Great Britain]] and [[France]].<ref>Emmanuel Mbah, ''Environment and Identity Politics in Colonial Africa: Fulani Migrations and Land Conflict'', Taylor & Francis, UK, 2016, p. 20</ref> In 1919, the administration of [[Northwest Region (Cameroon)|Northwest Region]] and thus the city of Bamenda became only British. In 1961, the region joined the [[Cameroon]].<ref>Emmanuel Mbah, ''Environment and Identity Politics in Colonial Africa: Fulani Migrations and Land Conflict'', Taylor & Francis, UK, 2016, p. 21</ref>

===Ambazonian aspirations===
Many of the city's inhabitants are [[English language|English-speaking]], and [[Cameroonian Pidgin English]] is the main language spoken in the shops and on the streets of Bamenda. The [[Southern Cameroons Liberation Council]] is a united front consisting of multiple groups of separatists aiming for an independent [[Ambazonia]]n state, which would include Bamenda.<ref>[https://natimesnews.com/usa-national-times-the-quest-for-the-restoration-of-the-southern-cameroons-statehood-took-another-decisive-twist-on-friday-march-29-to-sunday-march-31-2018-when-leaders-of-the-various-movement-fi/ Anglophone Struggle Takes Another Kink, Separatists, Federalists Bury Hatchet, Create Southern Cameroons Liberation Council] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190407071210/https://natimesnews.com/usa-national-times-the-quest-for-the-restoration-of-the-southern-cameroons-statehood-took-another-decisive-twist-on-friday-march-29-to-sunday-march-31-2018-when-leaders-of-the-various-movement-fi/ |date=7 April 2019 }}, The National Times, 1 Apr 2019.

==Metropolitan area==
The city is made up of 3 villages; Bamendakwe, Mankon and Nkwen classified as Bamenda I II and III sub-divisions respectively for administrative reasons. However, it is surrounded by other suburban areas and villages like Bambui, Akum, Bafut, Bali, Chombah and Mbatu. These suburban areas and villages are fast growing and sometimes considered as part of Bamenda.

==Economy==
The main industries are the processing of agricultural produce such as coffee, elementary food processing, handicraft, cottage industry, education (schools), tourism/hospitality, construction works and transport.<ref>Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/Bamenda Bamenda] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101082910/https://www.britannica.com/place/Bamenda |date=1 November 2020 }}, britannica.com, USA, accessed on 7 July 2019</ref> The local museum and shops display a wide variety of local baskets, beads, woodcarvings and [[bronze]] statues.

==Education==
{{see also|International University, Bamenda}}
[[File:Bambili, university of Bamenda.jpg|thumb|Bambili, University of Bamenda]] 
The city of Bamenda has many primary and secondary schools which offers both general technical and vocational training. It has a state-owned university, the [[University of Bamenda]], which trains students in all three cycles of education that is, Bachelor's, Master's & Doctorate (BMD) in different fields. Several University Institutes and professional institutions of learning also exist in the city of Bamenda. These institutions are mostly privately owned or owned by religious denominations. 

The [[Bamenda University of Science and Technology]] (BUST) is a brain child of The Industrial and Educational Development Company Ltd (INDECO). It was incorporated on 12 October 1995.

INDECO and the university (BUST) were founded by the Late Rt. Hon. [[John Ngu Foncha]], with the encouragement of the Cameroon Government. The university went operational in January 1998. At the request of government, BUST participated and contributed extensively to the drafting of the Law on Private Higher Education in Cameroon.

BUST is a 4-year Arts, Science and Technology University. Degrees offered include B.A., BEd, BSc, HND.,SRN., AN., Lab. Tech., and Assist. Lab. Tech. Formalities for Post Graduate Studies have been put in place, to go operational by the academic year 2010/2011.

Its main national affiliate is the University of [[Buea|Buéa]], though other partnership arrangements are under way with the University of [[Dschang]]. The Bamenda University of Science and Technology is affiliated to the [[University of Osnabrück]] (Germany) and the University of Wales at [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bamendauniversity.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=frontpage&Itemid=1 |title=Homepage of Bameda University|access-date=6 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714164227/http://www.bamendauniversity.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=frontpage&Itemid=1|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cameroonweb.com/CameroonHomePage/education/ |title=Education in Cameroon |publisher=CameroonWeb |access-date=11 September 2018 |quote=Originally The University of Buea was the only British/American style university, but with the University of Bamenda opening its doors in 2011 Cameroon now has two English Universities. |archive-date=5 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200805172012/https://www.cameroonweb.com/CameroonHomePage/education/ |url-status=live }}</ref> It trains college teachers, medical doctors etc. and graduates in Accountancy, management, marketing, and a number of other fields of study.

Another institution of higher learning is [[National Polytechnic Bamenda]], formerly [[National Polytechnic Bambui]].

==Places of worship==
Among the [[places of worship]], they are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples: [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bamenda]] ([[Catholic Church]]), [[Evangelical Church of Cameroon]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]), [[Presbyterian Church in Cameroon]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]), [[Cameroon Baptist Convention]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]]), Full Gospel Mission Cameroon ([[Assemblies of God]]), and [[Church of God Ministry of Jesus Christ International]].<ref>J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann, ‘'Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices'’, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2010, p. 484-486</ref> There are also [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques.

==Sports==
Over the years, Bamenda has had two [[Association football|football]] teams that played in the First Division Championship. In the 1970s, it was [[PWD Bamenda]] and later in the 1980s, it was [[Camark Bamenda]]. With the fall in the influence and budgeting of public works department and National Produce Marketing Board (NPMB), both teams fell from the limelight. Presently Camark Bamenda is out of existence, while PWD Bamenda are back in the top division after a slump to the third tier for almost 20 years. They won their first [[Elite One]] title in the [[2019–20 Elite One|2019-20 season]]. The other club from Bamenda in the professional league at the moment is [[Yong Sports Academy]]. They won the [[Cameroonian Cup]] in 2013.

==Politics==
Bamenda is the founding place and seat of the largest opposition political party in Cameroon, the [[Social Democratic Front (Cameroon)|Social Democratic Front]] (SDF), and the home of its leader, [[John Fru Ndi]]. There is a large military presence throughout the city. On 26 May 1990, a group of Bamenda elites launched the party in Ntarikon Bamenda, despite a heavy police presence. However, the launching did not end without casualty as six civilians were killed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Bamenda is also the birthplace of The [[Southern Cameroons National Council]] (SCNC), a group that has been asking for the restoration of the former [[Southern Cameroons]], a territory that covers the English-speaking provinces of North West and South West. The SCNC was born in Bamenda in 1994, after the All Anglophone Conference (AAC2) issued the Bamenda Declaration in which it had asked the government of President [[Paul Biya]] to respond to all anglophone grievances stated in the Buea Declaration of 1993, or face the wrath of the people of the Southern Cameroons. The Cameroon government failed to respond to the Bamenda Declaration and since then, the SCNC has categorically maintained that it now considers the restoration of the independence of the Southern Cameroons to be final and irrevocable.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bareta.news/bamenda-forgotten-city/ |title=BAMENDA: A FORGOTTEN CITY AND THE PEOPLE CRY FOR GOOD ROADS |website=www.bareta.news |date=26 July 2016 |language=en-US |access-date=2017-11-29 |archive-date=9 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191009100245/https://www.bareta.news/bamenda-forgotten-city/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
