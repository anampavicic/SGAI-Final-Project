'''Niamey''' ({{IPA|fr|njamɛ}}) is the [[Capital city|capital]] and largest city of [[Niger]]. Niamey lies on the [[Niger River]], primarily situated on the east bank. Niamey's population was counted as 1,026,848 as of the 2012 census. As of 2017, population projections show the capital district growing at a slower rate than the country as a whole, which has the world's highest [[Total fertility rate|fertility rate]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://citypopulation.de/Niger.html |title=Niger: Regions, Departments, Communes, Cities, Localities and Municipal Arrondissements - Population Statistics in Maps and Charts |website=citypopulation.de}}</ref> The city is located in a [[pearl millet]] growing region, while manufacturing industries include bricks, [[ceramic]] goods, cement, and [[weaving]].{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Niamey}}
[[Image:Mittelholzer-niamey.jpg|thumb|left|Niamey in December 1930. The large house in the centre is the French governor's residence. Air photo taken by Swiss pilot and photographer [[Walter Mittelholzer]].]]
Probably, Niamey originated in the 18th century as a cluster of small villages (Gaweye, Kalley, Maourey, Zongo and Foulani Koira).<ref name="Bradt">Geels, Jolijn, (2006) ''Bradt Travel Guide - Niger'', pgs. 93-113</ref> Niamey was of little importance until the French developed it as a colonial centre in the late 1890s. The town, then with an estimated population of some 1,800, was chosen as the capital of the newly created Military Territory of Niger in 1905, however, the capital was shifted to the more established city of [[Zinder]] in 1912.<ref name="Bradt"/> Zinder's proximity to the Nigerian border and distance from French-controlled ports prompted the French to move the capital back to Niamey in 1926, by which time the city had some 3,000 inhabitants.<ref name="Bradt"/> A series of devastating droughts prompted influx from the countryside into the city, leading to significant population growth, and by 1945 the population was about 8,000.<ref name="Bradt"/>

Prior to 1926-27 the [[French Upper Volta|Upper Volta]]-Niger [[Burkina Faso-Niger border|border]] ran along the Niger river, meaning that Niamey lay directly on the boundary.<ref name="IBS146">{{citation |url=https://fall.fsulawrc.com/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS146.pdf |title=International Boundary Study No. 146 – Burkina Faso-Niger Boundary |date=18 November 1974 |access-date=5 November 2019}}</ref>
[[File:Niger, Niamey, Place du Liptako-Gourma (2).jpg|thumb|Place du Liptako-Gourma]]
At the time of independence in 1960 the population had grown to around 30,000.<ref>Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/Niamey Niamey], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref><ref name=sahel20110701/><ref name="Bradt"/> The period from 1970 to 1988 was one in which the economy of Niger boomed, driven by revenue from the [[uranium]] mines at [[Arlit]]. As a result, the population of Niamey grew from 108,000 to 398,365 inhabitants and the city expanded from {{cvt|1367|ha|acre}} in 1970 to {{cvt|4400|ha|acre}} by 1977, in the process annexing peripheral villages such as [[Lazaret, Niger|Lazaret]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LjzZ_rVv_2MC&pg=PA30 |title=Villes et organisation de l'espace en Afrique |pages=30–31 |first1=Jérôme |last1=Aloko-N'Guessan |first2=Amadou |last2=Diallo |first3=Kokou Henri |last3=Motcho |publisher=Karthala Editions |year=2010 |isbn=978-2-8111-0339-2}}</ref> Continuing droughts also caused many rural Nigeriens to move to the growing city.<ref name="Bradt"/>

In 1992 Niamey and its immediate hinterland were split off from Niamey Region to form the much smaller Niamey Capital District, enclaved within the new [[Tillabéri Region]].<ref name="Statsoid">According to [http://www.statoids.com/une.html Statsoid] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724154849/http://www.statoids.com/une.html |date=2009-07-24 }}: "~1992: Tillabéry Region split from Niamey (whose FIPS code was NG05 before the change). Status of Niamey changed from Region to capital district."</ref>

On April 9, 1999, [[Niger]] President [[Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara]] was ambushed, shot and killed during [[1999 Nigerien coup d'état|Nigerien coup d'état]] by soldiers, reportedly members of the Presidential Guard at the [[Diori Hamani International Airport]] as he was going to board a helicopter.

By some estimates, the population had reached 700,000 in 2000.<ref name="Bradt"/> In 2011, government press estimated the total urban population at over 1.5&nbsp;million. A major cause of the increase has been in migration for work and during droughts, as well as a high birth rate.<ref name=sahel20110701 /> This last factor means that demographically a majority of the city's citizens are young people.<ref name=sahel20110701 />

On 13 April 2024, hundreds rallied in the Niamey to demand the withdrawal of the US military from the north, after the capital’s military announced to withdraw from a military agreement with the US.<ref>{{cite news|title=Niger protesters demand US troop withdrawal |date=13 April 2024 |url=https://www.dw.com/en/niger-protesters-demand-us-troop-withdrawal/a-68812727 |website=DW |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240413204833/https://www.dw.com/en/niger-protesters-demand-us-troop-withdrawal/a-68812727 |archive-date=13 April 2024 |access-date=14 April 2024}}</ref>

Since July 2023, the Niger junta has been renaming street names dating back to the colonial era to more local street names.<ref name="DW">{{citation |url=https://www.dw.com/fr/au-niger-la-junte-militaire-rebaptise-des-rues-de-niamey/a-70507221 |title=Au Niger, la junte militaire rebaptise des rues de Niamey |date=15 October 2024 |access-date=16 October 2024}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Pont de l'amitié Chine-Niger - Niamey from the Sky.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Friendship Bridge]]

The Niamey region straddles between the [[Liptako]], corresponding to the northern extremity of the East ridge of Man, and the south-western edge of the [[Iullemmeden Basin|Iullemmeden basin]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |date=2016-11-01 |title=Monitoring of Urban Growth and its Related Environmental Impacts: Niamey Case Study (Niger) |journal=Energy Procedia |language=en |volume=97 |pages=37–43 |doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2016.10.014 |issn=1876-6102|doi-access=free|last1=Perotti |first1=Luigi |last2=Dino |first2=Giovanna Antonella |last3=Lasagna |first3=Manuela |last4=Moussa |first4=Konaté |last5=Spadafora |first5=Francesco |last6=Yadji |first6=Guero |last7=Dan-Badjo |first7=Abdourahamane Tankari |last8=De Luca |first8=Domenico A. |hdl=2318/1627824 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> Covering an area of over {{cvt|250|km2}}, the metropolitan area sits atop two plateaux reaching {{cvt|218|m}} in altitude, bisected by the [[Niger River]]. At Niamey, the river, running almost straight SSE from [[Gao, Mali]], makes a series of wide bends. The city grew on the east ("left bank") of the river as it meanders from west to east flow to run almost directly south. A series of marshy islands begin at Niamey and extend south in the river.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}

The vast majority of the population and government and [[Commercial property|commercial buildings]] are located on the eastern bank of the river. The very centre of the centre contains a number of wide boulevards linking roundabouts. Two bridges connect the two sides - the [[Kennedy Bridge (Niamey)|Kennedy Bridge]] and the Friendship Bridge. The western bank area consists mainly of residential areas such as Gaweye, Saguia, Lamorde, Saga, and Karadje, as well as [[Abdou Moumouni University]].{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}

===Climate===
The climate is hot and [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] [[semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|''BSh'']]), with an expected rainfall of between {{cvt|500|mm|in}} and {{cvt|750|mm|in}} a year, mostly beginning with a few storms in May, then a transition to a rainy season, usually lasting from sometime in June to early September, when the rains taper off rather quickly. Most of the rainfall is from late June to mid-September. There is practically no rain from October to April. Niamey is remarkably hot throughout the year. In fact, it is one of the world's hottest major cities. Average monthly high temperatures reach {{cvt|38|°C}} four months out of the year and in no month do average high temperatures fall below {{cvt|32|°C}}. During the dry season, particularly from November through February, nights are generally cool. Average nighttime lows between November and February range from {{cvt|14|-|18|°C}}.

Niamey's population has grown rapidly since independence - the droughts of the early 1970s and 1980s, along with the economic crisis of the early 1980s, have propelled an exodus of rural inhabitants to Niger's largest city.<ref name="Statsoid"/> Its population increased gradually, from about 3,000 in 1930 to about 30,000 in 1960, rising to 250,000 in 1980 and, according to the official statistics, to 800,000 in 2000.<ref name=":0" /> Under the military government of General [[Seyni Kountché]], there were strict controls on residency and the government would regularly round up and "deport" those without permits back to their villages.<ref name=Rues_de_Niamey>Patrick Gilliard, and Laurent Pédenon "[http://www.politique-africaine.com/numeros/pdf/063051.pdf Rues de Niamey, espace et territoires de la mendicité]" [[Politique africaine]], Paris (October 1996) no.63 pp. 51–60.</ref> The growing freedoms of the late 1980s and 1990s, along with the [[Tuareg rebellion (1990–1995)|Tuareg Rebellion]] of the 1990s and famine in the 2000s, have reinforced this process of internal migration, with large informal settlements appearing on the outskirts of the city. Noticeable in the city's centre since the 1980s are groups of poor, young, or handicapped beggars.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Within the richer or more trafficked neighbourhoods, these beggars have in fact formed a well-regulated hierarchical system in which beggars garner ''[[Sadaqah|sadaka]]'' according to cultural and religious norms.<ref name=Rues_de_Niamey />

In the 1990s, the capital district population growth rate was lower than the torrid national rate, suggesting large rural migration ([[urbanization]]) was negligible in Niger, there is an undercount, and/or the government's forced urban to rural deportations were effective.<ref name=Rues_de_Niamey />

==Culture and architecture==
[[File:Niger, Niamey, Rue NB-26 (2).jpg|thumb|Niamey marketplace]]
[[File:Zoo du Musée national de Niamey.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Niger National Museum]]]]
A major attraction in the city is the [[Niger National Museum]], which incorporates a [[zoo]], a museum of [[vernacular architecture]], a craft centre, and exhibits including [[dinosaur]] [[skeleton]]s and the [[Tree of Ténéré]]. Other places of interest include the American, French and Nigerien [[cultural centre]]s, seven major market centres (including the large [[Niamey Grand Market]]), a traditional [[wrestling]] arena, and a horse racing track. Most of the colourful pottery sold in Niamey is hand made in the nearby village of [[Boubon]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

In December 2005, it was the host of the [[Jeux de la Francophonie]].

Niger being a predominantly Muslim country, [[mosques]] are the most common places of worship, with the [[Grand Mosque of Niamey|Grande Mosquée]] being the largest in the city. There are also various [[Christianity|Christian]] churches, most notably [[Our Lady of Perpetual Help Cathedral, Niamey|Our Lady of Perpetual Help Cathedral]], the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Niamey]], and the Cathedral de Maourey.<ref>J.

==Governance==
<!--linked section at "Communes of Niamey"-->

===Administration===
Niamey makes up a special [[Capital districts and territories|capital district]] of Niger, which is surrounded by the Region of [[Tillabéri Region|Tillabéri]].
[[File:Old Presidential Palace in Niamey - Mapillary (1zunKARfz0wkJExHFVEFng).jpg|thumb|200px|Old presidential palace]]
The city of Niamey itself is governed as an autonomous first-level administrative block, the Niamey Urban Community (Fr. Communauté Urbaine de Niamey, or CUN). It includes five [[Communes of Niger|Urban Communes]], divided into 44 "Districts" and 99 "Quartiers", including formerly independent towns. It is a co-equal first division subdivision with the seven [[Regions of Niger]]. The Niamey Urban Community includes an administration and Governor appointed by national leaders.<ref name=sahel20110701 /> Like the rest of Niger, Niamey has seen a decentralisation of governance since 2000. Government Ordinance n°2010–56 and Presidential Decree n°2010-679 of September 2010 mandated an elected City Council for the city of Niamey, subsumed under the CUN. This excludes some outlying areas of the CUN.<ref name=sahel20110701 /> Forty-five councillors are popularly elected and in turn elect the Mayor of the City of Niamey. In July 2011, the first Mayor under the new system, [[Oumarou Dogari Moumouni]], was installed by the Governor of the CUN Mrs. [[Aïchatou Boulama Kané]] and the City Council.<ref name=sahel20110701 /> The City Council and Mayor have limited roles compared to the CUN Governor. Niamey has a third layer of government in the [[Communes of Niger|Commune]] system. Each Commune elects its own council, and outside major cities, these function like independent cities. Niamey and other major cities have been, since the advent of decentralisation, developing co-ordination of Commune governments in large cities made up of multiple Communes.<ref name=sahel20110701 />

Under this devolution process<ref>Haut Commissariat à la Réforme Administrative: loi N°2002-016 bis du 11 une 2002.</ref> formalised in the 1999 [[Constitution of Niger]], the CUN contains five urban communes, which are further divided into 99 quarters ("''Quartiers''") with elected boards.

===Communes and quarters===
The CUN includes 99 quarters:<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Adamou Abdoulaye.
