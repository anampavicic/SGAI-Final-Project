==History==
The area of Miyakonojō was part of ancient [[Hyūga Province]]. In 1026, near the end of the [[Heian period]], it was site of the [[Shimazu Estate]], the largest ''[[shōen]]'' (landed estate or manor) of medieval Japan. Expanded substantially in the first half of the 12th century, it eventually covered large portions of [[Satsuma Province|Satsuma]], [[Ōsumi Province|Ōsumi]] and [[Hyūga Province]]s. In 1185, [[Shimazu Tadahisa|Koremune no Tadahisa]] was appointed as ''[[jitō]]'' of the estate, and adopted the name of the manor, thus founding the [[Shimazu clan]]. The area was ruled by the Hongō clan, a cadet branch of the Shimazu, in the [[Muromachi period]], and with a ''[[kokudaka]]'' of 40,000 ''[[koku]]'', was the largest of the autonomous territories within [[Satsuma Domain]] in the [[Edo period]]. Following the [[Meiji restoration]], the town of Miyakonojō was established on May 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. It was elevated to city status on April 1, 1924.

On January 1, 2006, the towns of [[Takajo, Miyazaki|Takajō]], [[Takazaki, Miyazaki|Takazaki]], [[Yamada, Miyazaki|Yamada]] and [[Yamanokuchi, Miyazaki|Yamanokuchi]] (all from [[Kitamorokata District, Miyazaki|Kitamorokata District]]) were merged into Miyakonojō.

==Government==
Miyakonojō has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 29 members. Miyakonojō contributes six members to the Miyazaki Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the [[Miyazaki 1st district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Many of Miyakonojō's citizens work as farmers. They produce [[Arctium lappa|''gobō'']], meat, and [[bell pepper]]s.  Miyakonojō is also home to some agriculture-related [[manufacturing]].

Miyakonojō is also famous for producing traditional Japanese [[Bow (weapon)|archery bows]] from the abundant [[bamboo]] in the area.<ref>[http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/arrange/attractions/facilities/traditional_handicrafts/83dn3a000000elvr.html Miyakonojo daikyu (archery bows)], [[Japan National Tourist Organization]].</ref>

==Education==
Miyakonojō has 35 public elementary schools and 19 public junior high schools operated by the city government. The city has six public high schools operated by the Miyazaki Prefectural Board of Education. There are also two private high schools.
