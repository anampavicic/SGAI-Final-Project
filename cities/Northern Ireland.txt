[[File:Northern Ireland - Counties.png|thumb|left|alt=Northern Ireland – Counties|The traditional counties of Northern Ireland]]

The region that is now Northern Ireland was long inhabited by native [[Gaels]] who were Irish-speaking and predominantly Catholic.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stanbridge |first1=Karen |title=Toleration and State Institutions: British Policy Toward Catholics in Eighteenth-century Ireland and Quebec |date=2003 |publisher=Lexington Books |page=43}}; {{cite book |last1=Ruane |first1=Joseph |title=The Dynamics of Conflict in Northern Ireland: Power, Conflict and Emancipation |date=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=51}}</ref> It was made up of several Gaelic kingdoms and territories and was part of the province of [[Ulster]]. In 1169, [[Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland|Ireland was invaded by a coalition]] of forces under the command of the English crown that quickly overran and occupied most of the island, beginning 800 years of foreign central authority. Attempts at resistance were swiftly crushed everywhere outside of Ulster. Unlike in the rest of the country, where Gaelic authority continued only in scattered, remote pockets, the major kingdoms of Ulster would mostly remain intact with English authority in the province contained to [[Earldom of Ulster|areas on the eastern coast]] closest to Great Britain. English power gradually eroded in the face of stubborn Irish resistance in the centuries that followed; eventually being reduced to only the city of Dublin and its suburbs. When [[Henry VIII]] launched the 16th century [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor re-conquest of Ireland]], Ulster once again resisted most effectively. In the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] (1593–1603), an alliance of Gaelic chieftains led by the two most powerful Ulster lords, [[Hugh Roe O'Donnell]] and [[Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone|Hugh O'Neill]], fought against the [[Dublin Castle administration|English government in Ireland]]. The Ulster-dominated alliance represented the first Irish united front; prior resistance had always been geographically localized. Despite being able to cement an alliance with Spain and major victories early on, defeat was virtually inevitable following England's victory at the [[siege of Kinsale]]. In 1607, the rebellion's leaders [[Flight of the Earls|fled to mainland Europe]] alongside much of Ulster's Gaelic nobility. Their lands were confiscated by [[the Crown]] and colonized with English-speaking Protestant [[settler]]s from Britain, in the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. This led to the founding of many of Ulster's towns and created a lasting [[Ulster Protestants|Ulster Protestant]] community with ties to Britain. The [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] began in Ulster. The rebels wanted an end to anti-Catholic discrimination, greater Irish self-governance, and to roll back the Plantation. It developed into an ethnic conflict between Irish Catholics and British Protestant settlers and became part of the wider [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] (1639–53), which ended with the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|English Parliamentarian conquest]]. Further Protestant victories in the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite-Jacobite War]] (1688–91) solidified [[Church of Ireland|Anglican Protestant]] rule in the [[Kingdom of Ireland]]. The Williamite victories of the [[siege of Derry]] (1689) and [[Battle of the Boyne]] (1690) are still celebrated by some Protestants in Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/government-citizens-and-rights/living-in-northern-ireland/bank-holidays.htm |title=Bank holidays |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122114013/http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/government-citizens-and-rights/living-in-northern-ireland/bank-holidays.htm |archive-date=22 November 2010}}; {{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-20565591 |title=Lundy's Day: Thousands attend 'peaceful' Londonderry parade |work=BBC News |date=December 2012 |access-date=21 June 2018 |archive-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923010159/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-20565591 |url-status=live}}</ref> Many more Scots Protestants migrated to Ulster during the [[Seven ill years|Scottish famine of the 1690s]].

Following the Williamite victory, and contrary to the [[Treaty of Limerick]] (1691), a series of [[Penal laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] were passed by the [[Protestant Ascendancy|Anglican Protestant ruling class]] in Ireland. The intention was to disadvantage Catholics and, to a lesser extent, [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]]. Some 250,000 Ulster Presbyterians emigrated to the [[British America|British North American]] colonies between 1717 and 1775.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thernstrom |first=Stephan |title=Harvard encyclopedia of American ethnic groups |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=npQ6Hd3G4kgC&pg=PA896 |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1980 |page=896 |isbn=978-0-674-37512-3 |access-date=29 October 2011 |archive-date=13 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210413214646/https://books.google.com/books?id=npQ6Hd3G4kgC&pg=PA896 |url-status=live}}</ref> It is estimated that there are more than 27&nbsp;million [[Scotch-Irish Americans]] now living in the United States,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780767916899-1 |title=Born Fighting: How the Scots-Irish Shaped America |publisher=Powells.com |date=12 August 2009 |access-date=30 April 2010 |archive-date=16 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116001733/http://powells.com/biblio/1-9780767916899-1 |url-status=live}}</ref> along with many [[Scotch-Irish Canadians]] in Canada. In the context of institutional discrimination, the 18th century saw secret, militant societies develop in Ulster and act on sectarian tensions in violent attacks. This escalated at the end of the century, especially during the County [[Armagh disturbances]], where the Protestant [[Peep o' Day Boys]] fought the [[Defenders (Ireland)|Catholic Defenders]]. This led to the founding of the Protestant [[Orange Order]]. The [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] was led by the [[Society of United Irishmen|United Irishmen]]; a cross-community [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] group founded by Belfast Presbyterians, which sought Irish independence. Following this, the government of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] pushed for the two kingdoms to be merged, in an attempt to quell violent sectarianism, remove discriminatory laws, and prevent the spread of French-style republicanism. The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] was formed in 1801 and governed from London. During the 19th century, legal reforms known as the [[Catholic emancipation]] continued to remove discrimination against Catholics, and progressive programs enabled tenant farmers to buy land from landlords.

By the late 19th century, a large and disciplined cohort of [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Irish Nationalist]] MPs at Westminster committed the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] to [[Irish Home Rule movement|"Irish Home Rule"]]—self-government for Ireland, within the United Kingdom. This was bitterly opposed by [[Unionism in Ireland|Irish Unionists]], most of whom were Protestants, who feared an Irish devolved government dominated by Irish nationalists and Catholics. The [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886]] and [[Government of Ireland Bill 1893]] were defeated. However, Home Rule became a near-certainty in 1912 after the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914]] was first introduced. The Liberal government was dependent on Nationalist support, and the [[Parliament Act 1911]] prevented the House of Lords from blocking the bill indefinitely.<ref name=Lydon326>James F.

In response, unionists vowed to prevent Irish Home Rule, from [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative and Unionist Party]] leaders such as [[Bonar Law]] and Dublin-based barrister [[Edward Carson]] to militant working class unionists in Ireland. This sparked the [[Home Rule Crisis]]. In September 1912, more than 500,000 unionists signed the [[Ulster Covenant]], pledging to oppose Home Rule by any means and to defy any Irish government.<ref>[[A. T. Q.

Unionists were in a minority in Ireland as a whole, but a majority in the province of [[Ulster]], especially the counties [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Down|Down]], [[County Armagh|Armagh]] and [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]].<ref name="StephenGwynn">{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IWnrSFoQVw0C&q=%22northern+ireland%22+partition+two+counties+nationalist+majority+tyrone+fermanagh&pg=PA525 |first=Stephen |last=Gwynn |author-link=Stephen Gwynn |chapter=The birth of the Irish Free State |title=The History of Ireland |year=2009 |orig-date=1923 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-1-113-15514-6 |access-date=19 October 2020 |archive-date=13 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210413214537/https://books.google.com/books?id=IWnrSFoQVw0C&q=%22northern+ireland%22+partition+two+counties+nationalist+majority+tyrone+fermanagh&pg=PA525 |url-status=live}}</ref> Unionists argued that if Home Rule could not be stopped then all or part of Ulster should be excluded from it.<ref>O'Day, Alan.

The UK government abandoned the Amending Bill, and instead rushed through a new bill, the [[Suspensory Act 1914]], suspending Home Rule for the duration of the war,<ref>Hennessey, Thomas: ''Dividing Ireland, World War I and Partition'', ''The passing of the Home Rule Bill'' p. 76, Routledge Press (1998) {{ISBN|0-415-17420-1}}</ref> with the exclusion of Ulster still to be decided.<ref>Jackson, Alvin: p. 164</ref>

By the end of the war (during which the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] had taken place), most Irish nationalists now wanted full independence rather than home rule. In September 1919, British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] tasked a committee with planning another home rule bill. Headed by [[Unionism in Ireland|English unionist]] politician [[Walter Long, 1st Viscount Long|Walter Long]], it was known as the 'Long Committee'. It decided that two devolved governments should be established—one for the nine counties of Ulster and one for the rest of Ireland—together with a [[Council of Ireland]] for the "encouragement of Irish unity".<ref>Jackson, pp. 227–229</ref> Most Ulster unionists wanted the territory of the Ulster government to be reduced to six counties so that it would have a larger Protestant unionist majority, which they believed would guarantee its longevity. The six counties of [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Down|Down]], [[County Armagh|Armagh]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]] and [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]] comprised the maximum area unionists believed they could dominate.<ref>Morland, Paul. ''Demographic Engineering: Population Strategies in Ethnic Conflict''. Routledge, 2016. pp.96–98</ref> The area that was to become Northern Ireland included counties Fermanagh and Tyrone, even though they had nationalist majorities in the [[1918 Irish general election]].<ref>{{cite report |title=The Irish Election of 1918 |url=https://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/h1918.htm |publisher=Northern Ireland Elections |docket= |access-date=31 August 2022 |archive-date=17 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817120216/http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/h1918.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Events overtook the government. In the 1918 Irish general election, the pro-independence [[Sinn Féin]] party won the overwhelming majority of Irish seats. Sinn Féin's elected members boycotted the British parliament and founded a separate Irish parliament ([[First Dáil|Dáil Éireann]]), [[Irish Declaration of Independence|declaring an independent Irish Republic]] covering the whole island. Many [[Irish republicans]] blamed the British establishment for the sectarian divisions in Ireland, and believed that Ulster unionism would fade once British rule was ended.{{Sfnp|Lynch|2019|pages=51–52}} The British authorities outlawed the Dáil in September 1919,<ref>Mitchell, Arthur. ''Revolutionary Government in Ireland''. Gill & MacMillan, 1995. p. 245</ref> and a guerrilla conflict developed as the [[Irish Republican Army (1919–1922)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) began attacking British forces. This became known as the [[Irish War of Independence]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Coleman |first1=Marie |title=The Irish Revolution, 1916–1923 |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1317801474 |page=67}}; Gibney, John (editor).

Meanwhile, the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] passed through the British parliament in 1920. It would divide Ireland into two self-governing UK territories: the six northeastern counties (Northern Ireland) being ruled from [[Belfast]], and the other twenty-six counties ([[Southern Ireland (1921–1922)|Southern Ireland]]) being ruled from [[Dublin]]. Both would have a shared [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], who would appoint both governments and a [[Council of Ireland]], which the UK government intended to evolve into an all-Ireland parliament.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pilkington |first=Colin |author-link= |title=Devolution in Britain Today |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=2002 |page=75 |isbn=978-0-7190-6076-2}}</ref> The Act received [[royal assent]] that December, becoming the Government of Ireland Act 1920.

Irish nationalist members refused to attend. King George V addressed the ceremonial opening of the Northern parliament on 22 June.<ref name="O'Day 299"/>

During 1920–22, in what became Northern Ireland, partition was accompanied by violence "in defence or opposition to the new settlement"{{Sfnp|Lynch|2019|pages=11, 100–101}} during [[The Troubles (1920–1922)]]. The IRA carried out attacks on British forces in the north-east but was less active than in the rest of Ireland. Protestant loyalists attacked Catholics in reprisal for IRA actions. In the summer of 1920, sectarian violence erupted in Belfast and Derry, and there were mass burnings of Catholic property in [[Lisburn]] and [[Banbridge]].{{Sfnp|Lynch|2019|pages=90–92}} Conflict continued intermittently for two years, mostly in [[Belfast]], which saw "savage and unprecedented" [[communal violence]] between Protestants and Catholics, including rioting, gun battles, and bombings. Homes, businesses, and churches were attacked and people were expelled from workplaces and mixed neighbourhoods.{{Sfnp|Lynch|2019|pages=11, 100–101}} More than 500 were killed{{Sfnp|Lynch|2019|page=99}} and more than 10,000 became refugees, most of them Catholics.{{Sfnp|Lynch|2019|pages=71–76}} The [[British Army]] was deployed and the [[Ulster Special Constabulary]] (USC) was formed to help the regular police. The USC was almost wholly Protestant. Members of the USC and regular police were involved in reprisal attacks on Catholic civilians.<ref>Farrell, Michael. ''Arming the Protestants: The Formation of the Ulster Special Constabulary and the Royal Ulster Constabulary''. Pluto Press, 1983. p.166</ref> A truce between British forces and the IRA was established on 11 July 1921, ending the fighting in most of Ireland.

The [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] was signed between representatives of the governments of the UK and the [[Irish Republic]] on 6 December 1921, laying out the process for the creation of the [[Irish Free State]]. Under the terms of the treaty, Northern Ireland would become part of the Free State unless its government opted out by presenting an address to the king, although in practice partition remained in place.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Martin |first1=Ged |editor1-last=Anderson |editor1-first=Malcolm |editor2-last=Bort |editor2-first=Eberhard |title=The Irish Border: History, Politics, Culture |date=1999 |publisher=Liverpool University Press |isbn=978-0853239512 |page=68 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=59OPsS6a4j4C&pg=PA68 |access-date=19 October 2015 |chapter=The Origins of Partition |archive-date=29 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129062001/https://books.google.com/books?id=59OPsS6a4j4C&pg=PA68 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The Irish Free State came into existence on 6 December 1922, and on the following day, the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] resolved to exercise its right to opt out of the Free State by making an address to King [[George V]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gibbons |first1=Ivan |title=The British Labour Party and the Establishment of the Irish Free State, 1918–1924 |date=2015 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1137444080 |page=107 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pO6_CQAAQBAJ&pg=PA107 |access-date=19 October 2015 |archive-date=29 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129061632/https://books.google.com/books?id=pO6_CQAAQBAJ&pg=PA107 |url-status=live}}</ref> The text of the address was: {{Blockquote|Most Gracious Sovereign, We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Senators and Commons of Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled, having learnt of the passing of the [[Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922]], being the Act of Parliament for the ratification of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, do, by this humble Address, pray your Majesty that the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=2&pageno=1145#bak-2-1149 |title=The Stormont Papers – View Volumes |access-date=28 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415143605/http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=2&pageno=1145#bak-2-1149 |archive-date=15 April 2016}}; {{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.ie/topics/anglo_irish/dfaexhib2.html |title=Anglo-Irish Treaty, sections 11, 12 |publisher=Nationalarchives.ie |date=6 December 1921 |access-date=7 August 2013 |archive-date=8 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108213900/http://www.nationalarchives.ie/topics/anglo_irish/dfaexhib2.html |url-status=live}}</ref>}} Shortly afterwards, the [[Irish Boundary Commission]] was established to decide on the border between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. Owing to the outbreak of the [[Irish Civil War]], the work of the commission was delayed until 1925. The Free State government and Irish nationalists hoped for a large transfer of territory to the Free State, as many border areas had nationalist majorities. Many believed this would leave the remaining Northern Ireland territory too small to be viable.<ref>Knirck, Jason.

Rowman & Littlefield, 2006. p.104</ref> However, the commission's final report recommended only small transfers of territory, and in both directions.

Northern Ireland's border was drawn to give it "a decisive Protestant majority". At the time of its creation, Northern Ireland's population was two-thirds Protestant and one-third Catholic.<ref name="McKittrick-McVea p5"/> Most Protestants were unionists/loyalists who sought to maintain Northern Ireland as a part of the United Kingdom, while most Catholics were Irish nationalists/republicans who sought an independent [[United Ireland]]. There was mutual self-imposed [[segregation in Northern Ireland]] between Protestants and Catholics such as in education, housing, and often employment.<ref name="Making Sense 17-19">McKittrick & McVea, pp.17–19</ref>

For its first fifty years, Northern Ireland had an unbroken series of [[Government of Northern Ireland (1921–1972)|Ulster Unionist Party governments]].<ref>McKittrick & McVea, p.6</ref> Every prime minister and almost every minister of these governments were members of the [[Orange Order]], as were all but 11 of the 149 [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) MPs elected during this time.<ref>McKittrick & McVea, p.14</ref> Almost all judges and magistrates were Protestant, many of them closely associated with the UUP. Northern Ireland's new police force was the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC), which succeeded the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] (RIC). It too was almost wholly Protestant and lacked operational independence, responding to directions from government ministers. The RUC and the reserve [[Ulster Special Constabulary]] (USC) were militarized police forces due to the perceived threat of militant republicanism. In 1936 the British advocacy group - the [[Liberty (advocacy group)|National Council for Civil Liberties]] characterised the USC as "nothing but the organised army of the Unionist party".<ref>Boyd, Andrew (1984), ''Northern Ireland: Who is to Blame?'', The Mercier Press Limited, Dublin, p. 57, {{ISBN|0853427089}}</ref> They "had at their disposal the [[Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922|Special Powers Act]], a sweeping piece of legislation which allowed arrests without warrant, internment without trial, unlimited search powers, and bans on meetings and publications".<ref>McKittrick & McVea, p. 11</ref> This 1922 Act was made permanent in 1933 and was not repealed until 1973.<ref>McGuffin, John (1973), ''Internment!'', Anvil Books Ltd, Tralee, Ireland, p. 23.</ref>

The [[Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland)|Nationalist Party]] was the main political party in opposition to the UUP governments. However, its elected members often protested by [[Abstentionism|abstaining]] from the Northern Ireland parliament, and many nationalists did not vote in parliamentary elections.<ref name="Making Sense 17-19"/> Other early nationalist groups which campaigned against partition included the [[National League of the North]] (formed in 1928), the [[Northern Council for Unity]] (formed in 1937) and the [[Irish Anti-Partition League]] (formed in 1945).<ref>Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley (editors). ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations''. A&C Black, 2000. pp.236–237</ref>

The Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) of 1922 allowed for the altering of municipal and rural boundaries. This Act led to the [[gerrymandering]] of local election boundaries in the Nationalists majority cities of Derry City, Enniskillen, Omagh, Armagh and many other towns and rural districts. That action ensured Unionist control over local councils in areas where they were a minority.<ref>Boyd, Andrew (1969), ''Holy War in Belfast'', Anvil Books Ltd, Tralee, pg 176.</ref> The UUP governments, and some UUP-dominated local authorities, discriminated against the Catholic and Irish nationalist minority; especially by the gerrymandering of local electoral boundaries, the allocation of public housing, public sector employment, and policing, showing "a consistent and irrefutable pattern of deliberate discrimination against Catholics".<ref>Whyte, John. "How much discrimination was there under the unionist regime, 1921–68?", in ''Contemporary Irish Studies''. Edited by Tom Gallagher and James O'Connell. Manchester University Press, 1983. pp.29–32</ref> Many Catholics/Nationalists saw the gerrymandered local electoral boundaries and the abolishing of [[proportional representation]] as proof of government-sponsored discrimination. Until 1969 a system was in place called [[plural voting]] which was a practice whereby one person might be able to vote multiple times in an election. Property and business owners could vote both in the constituency where their property lay and that in which they lived, if the two were different. This system often resulted in one person being able to cast multiple votes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/apni/1968/20/introduction |title=Electoral Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1968 |website=www.legislation.gov.uk |access-date=24 July 2023 |archive-date=6 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230806071119/https://www.legislation.gov.uk/apni/1968/20/introduction |url-status=live }}</ref> Decades later, UUP [[First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland|First Minister of Northern Ireland]], [[David Trimble]], said that Northern Ireland under the UUP had been a "cold house" for Catholics.<ref>{{cite web |last1=David |first1=Trimble |title=Nobel Lecture |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1998/trimble/lecture/ |website=The Nobel Prize |access-date=8 August 2020 |archive-date=15 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210815173053/https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1998/trimble/lecture/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

During [[World War II]], recruitment to the British military was noticeably lower than the high levels reached during World War I. In June 1940, to encourage the [[Irish neutrality|neutral Irish state]] to join with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] indicated to Taoiseach [[Éamon de Valera]] that the British government would encourage Irish unity, but believing that Churchill could not deliver, de Valera declined the offer.<ref>"Anglo-Irish Relations, 1939–41: A Study in Multilateral Diplomacy and Military Restraint" in ''Twentieth Century British History'' (Oxford Journals, 2005), {{ISSN|1477-4674}}</ref> The British did not inform the government of Northern Ireland that they had made the offer to the Dublin government, and de Valera's rejection was not publicised until 1970. Belfast was a key industrial city in the UK's war effort, producing ships, tanks, aircraft, and munitions. The unemployment that had been so persistent in the 1930s disappeared, and labour shortages appeared, prompting migration from the Free State. The city was thinly defended, and had only 24 anti-aircraft guns. Richard [[Dawson Bates]], the Minister for Home Affairs, had prepared too late, assuming that Belfast was far enough away to be safe. The city's fire brigade was inadequate, and as the Northern Ireland government had been reluctant to spend money on air raid shelters, it only started to build them after [[the Blitz]] in London during the autumn of 1940. There were no searchlights in the city, which made shooting down enemy bombers more difficult. In April–May 1941, the [[Belfast Blitz]] began when the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' launched a series of raids that were the most deadly seen outside London. Working-class areas in the north and east of the city were particularly hard hit, and over 1,000 people were killed and hundreds were seriously injured. Tens of thousands of people fled the city in fear of future attacks. In the final raid, ''Luftwaffe'' bombs inflicted extensive damage to the docks and the [[Harland & Wolff]] shipyard, closing it for six months. Half of the city's houses had been destroyed, highlighting the terrible slum conditions in Belfast, and about £20 million worth of damage was caused. The Northern Ireland government was criticised heavily for its lack of preparation, and Northern Ireland Prime Minister [[J. M. Andrews]] resigned. There was a major munitions strike in 1944.<ref>Boyd Black, "A Triumph of Voluntarism? Industrial Relations and Strikes in Northern Ireland in World War Two," ''Labour History Review'' (2005) 70#1 pp 5–25</ref>

The [[Ireland Act 1949]] gave the first legal guarantee that the region would not cease to be part of the United Kingdom without the consent of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]].

From 1956 to 1962, the [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) carried out a limited guerrilla campaign in border areas of Northern Ireland, called the [[Border campaign (Irish Republican Army)|Border Campaign]]. It aimed to destabilize Northern Ireland and bring about an end to partition but failed.<ref>English, Richard. ''Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA''. Pan Macmillan, 2008. pp.72–74</ref>

The Troubles, which started in the late 1960s, consisted of about 30 years of recurring acts of intense violence during which 3,254 people were killed<ref>Malcolm Sutton's book, "Bear in Mind These Dead: An Index of Deaths from the Conflict in Ireland 1969–1993.</ref> with over 50,000 casualties.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/topics/troubles_violence |title=BBC – History – The Troubles – Violence |website=BBC |access-date=24 December 2019 |archive-date=5 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605010515/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/topics/troubles_violence |url-status=live}}</ref> From 1969 to 2003 there were over 36,900 shooting incidents and over 16,200 bombings or attempted bombings associated with The Troubles.<ref name="auto2"/> The conflict was caused by escalating tensions between the [[Irish nationalist]] minority and the dominant [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist majority]]; Irish nationalists object to Northern Ireland staying within the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/cameron2.htm#chap16 |title=The Cameron Report – Disturbances in Northern Ireland (1969) |website=cain.ulst.ac.uk |access-date=29 October 2011 |archive-date=1 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180601151429/http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/cameron2.htm#chap16 |url-status=live}}</ref> From 1967 to 1972 the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] (NICRA), which modelled itself on the US civil rights movement, led a campaign of [[civil resistance]] to anti-Catholic discrimination in housing, employment, policing, and electoral procedures.

While the majority of disenfranchised electors were Protestant, Catholics were over-represented since they were poorer and had more adults still living in the family home.<ref>[http://www.gale.cengage.com/pdf/whitepapers/gdc/Sectarianism.pdf History of sectarianism in NI] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201224942/http://www.gale.cengage.com/pdf/whitepapers/gdc/Sectarianism.pdf |date= 1 February 2014 }}, gale.cengage.com; accessed 27 May 2015.</ref>

NICRA's campaign, seen by many unionists as an [[Irish republican]] front, and the violent reaction to it proved to be a precursor to a more violent period.<ref>Richard English, "The Interplay of Non-violent and Violent Action in Northern Ireland, 1967–72", in [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009; {{ISBN|978-0-19-955201-6}}, pp. 75–90.

The state security forces – the [[British Army]] and the police (the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]]) – were also involved in the violence. The UK Government's position is that its forces were neutral in the conflict, trying to uphold law and order in Northern Ireland and the right of the people of Northern Ireland to democratic self-determination. Republicans regarded the state forces as [[combatant]]s in the conflict, pointing to the [[The Troubles#Collusion between security forces and paramilitaries|collusion between the state forces and the loyalist paramilitaries]] as proof of this. The "Ballast" investigation by the [[Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland]] has confirmed that British forces, and in particular the RUC, did collude with loyalist paramilitaries, were involved in murder, and did obstruct the course of justice when such claims had been investigated,<ref name="Ballast">[http://www.policeombudsman.org//Publicationsuploads/BALLAST%20PUBLIC%20STATEMENT%2022-01-07%20FINAL%20VERSION.pdf The Ballast report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625041216/http://www.policeombudsman.org//Publicationsuploads/BALLAST%20PUBLIC%20STATEMENT%2022-01-07%20FINAL%20VERSION.pdf |date=25 June 2008 }}: "...the Police Ombudsman has concluded that this was collusion by certain police officers with identified UVF informants."</ref> although the extent to which such collusion occurred is still disputed.

As a consequence of the worsening security situation, the autonomous regional government for Northern Ireland was suspended in 1972. Alongside the violence, there was a political deadlock between the major political parties in Northern Ireland, including those who condemned the violence, over the future status of Northern Ireland and the form of government there should be within Northern Ireland. In 1973, [[1973 Northern Ireland border poll|Northern Ireland held a referendum]] to determine if it should remain in the United Kingdom, or be part of a united Ireland. The vote went heavily in favour (98.9%) of maintaining the status quo. Approximately 57.5% of the total electorate voted in support, but only 1% of Catholics voted following a boycott organised by the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/9/newsid_2516000/2516477.stm |work=BBC News |title=1973: Northern Ireland votes for union |date=9 March 1973 |access-date=20 May 2010 |archive-date=27 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227020253/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/9/newsid_2516000/2516477.stm |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Peace process===
{{Main|Northern Ireland peace process}}
[[File:Foyle Bridge Derry at Dusk Oblique.jpg|thumb|[[Peace Bridge (Foyle)|Derry Peace Bridge]], over the [[River Foyle]]]]

The Troubles were brought to an uneasy end by a peace process that included the declaration of ceasefires by most paramilitary organisations and the complete decommissioning of their weapons, the reform of the police, and the corresponding withdrawal of army troops from the streets and sensitive border areas such as South Armagh and [[Fermanagh]], as agreed by the signatories to the Belfast Agreement (commonly known as the "[[Good Friday Agreement]]"). This reiterated the long-held British position, which had never before been fully acknowledged by successive Irish governments, that Northern Ireland will remain within the United Kingdom until a majority of voters in Northern Ireland decides otherwise. The [[Constitution of Ireland]] was amended in 1999 to remove a claim of the "Irish nation" to sovereignty over the entire island (in Article 2).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/546146.stm |title=BBC News {{!}} NORTHERN IRELAND {{!}} Republic drops claim to NI |website=BBC News |access-date=23 July 2018 |archive-date=6 April 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030406224757/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/546146.stm |url-status=live}}</ref>

The new [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|Articles 2 and 3]], added to the Constitution to replace the earlier articles, implicitly acknowledge that the status of Northern Ireland, and its relationships within the rest of the United Kingdom and with the Republic of Ireland, would only be changed with the agreement of a majority of voters in each jurisdiction. This aspect was also central to the Belfast Agreement which was signed in 1998 and ratified by referendums held simultaneously in both Northern Ireland and the Republic. At the same time, the UK Government recognised for the first time, as part of the prospective, the so-called "Irish dimension": the principle that the people of the island of Ireland as a whole have the right, without any outside interference, to solve the issues between North and South by mutual consent.<ref name="Parliament">[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199394/cmhansrd/1993-12-15/Debate-1.html Parliamentary debate] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010094440/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199394/cmhansrd/1993-12-15/Debate-1.html |date=10 October 2010 }}: "The British government agree that it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively, to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, North and South, to bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish."</ref> The latter statement was key to winning support for the agreement from nationalists. It established a devolved power-sharing government, the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], located on the [[Stormont Estate]], which must consist of both unionist and nationalist parties. These institutions were suspended by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] in 2002 after [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI) allegations of spying by people working for Sinn Féin at the Assembly ([[Stormontgate]]). The resulting case against the accused Sinn Féin member collapsed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/14561 |title=Securocrat sabotage exposed &#124; An Phoblacht |website=www.anphoblacht.com |access-date=25 January 2021 |archive-date=30 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210130201326/https://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/14561 |url-status=live}}; {{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v3SFzfha7VYC&q=collapse+stormontgate+donaldson&pg=PA306 |title=Bear in Mind These Dead |isbn=978-0571252183 |last1=McKay |first1=Susan |date=2009 |publisher=Faber & Faber |access-date=19 October 2020 |archive-date=13 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210413214647/https://books.google.com/books?id=v3SFzfha7VYC&q=collapse+stormontgate+donaldson&pg=PA306 |url-status=live}}</ref>

On 28 July 2005, the Provisional IRA declared an end to its campaign and has since decommissioned what is thought to be all of its [[arsenal]]. This final act of decommissioning was performed under the watch of the [[Independent International Commission on Decommissioning]] (IICD) and two external church witnesses. Many unionists, however, remained sceptical. The IICD later confirmed that the main loyalist paramilitary groups, the [[Ulster Defence Association]], UVF, and the [[Red Hand Commando]], had decommissioned what is thought to be all of their arsenals, witnessed by former archbishop [[Robin Eames]] and a former top civil servant.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8442683.stm "UDA confirm guns decommissioned"] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912045557/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8442683.stm |date=12 September 2017 }} BBC news; retrieved 29 January 2014</ref>

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Northern Ireland}}

===Background===
[[File:Political Parties of Northern Ireland.png|thumb|upright=2|center|A flowchart illustrating all the political parties that have existed throughout the history of Northern Ireland and leading up to its formation (covering 1889 to 2020)]]The main political divide in Northern Ireland is between unionists, who wish to see Northern Ireland continue as part of the United Kingdom, and nationalists, who wish to see Northern Ireland unified with the Republic of Ireland, independent from the United Kingdom. These two opposing views are linked to deeper cultural divisions. Unionists are predominantly [[Ulster Protestant]], descendants of mainly [[Scottish people|Scottish]], English, and [[Huguenot]] settlers as well as [[Gaels]] who converted to one of the Protestant denominations. Nationalists are overwhelmingly Catholic and descend from the population predating the settlement, with a minority from the [[Scottish Highlands]] as well as some converts from Protestantism. Discrimination against nationalists under the [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Stormont]] government (1921–1972) gave rise to the [[Northern Ireland civil rights movement|civil rights movement]] in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm |title=Professor John H.

While some unionists argue that discrimination was not just due to religious or political bigotry, but also the result of more complex socio-economic, socio-political and geographical factors,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/sum.htm |title=CAIN website key issues discrimination summary |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date=5 October 1968 |access-date=16 June 2010 |archive-date=29 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729075842/http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/sum.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> its existence, and the manner in which nationalist anger at it was handled, were a major contributing factor to the Troubles. The political unrest went through its most violent phase between 1968 and 1994.<ref>Lord Scarman, "Violence and Civil Disturbances in Northern Ireland in 1969: Report of Tribunal of Inquiry" Belfast: HMSO, Cmd&nbsp;566 (known as the ''Scarman Report'').</ref>

Official voting figures, which reflect views on the "national question" along with issues of the candidate, geography, personal loyalty, and historic voting patterns, show 54% of Northern Ireland voters vote for unionist parties, 42% vote for nationalist parties, and 4% vote "other". Opinion polls consistently show that the election results are not necessarily an indication of the electorate's stance regarding the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. Most of the population of Northern Ireland is at least nominally Christian, mostly Roman Catholic and Protestant denominations. Many voters (regardless of religious affiliation) are attracted to unionism's [[National conservatism|conservative]] policies, while other voters are instead attracted to the traditionally leftist Sinn Féin and SDLP and their respective party platforms for [[democratic socialism]] and [[social democracy]].<ref name="autogenerated2009">{{cite web |url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2009/Political_Attitudes/NIRELND2.html |title=NI Life and Times Survey – 2009: NIRELND2 |publisher=Ark.ac.uk |year=2009 |access-date=13 July 2010 |archive-date=10 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010085431/http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2009/Political_Attitudes/NIRELND2.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

For the most part, Protestants feel a strong connection with Great Britain and wish for Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. Many Catholics however, generally aspire to a United Ireland or are less certain about how to solve the constitutional question. Catholics have a slight majority in Northern Ireland, according to the latest Northern Ireland census. The make-up of the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] reflects the appeals of the various parties within the population. Of the 90&nbsp;[[Member of the Legislative Assembly (Northern Ireland)|Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs)]], 37 are unionists and 35 are nationalists (the remaining 18 are classified as "other").<ref name="results maps charts">{{Cite news |date=8 May 2022 |title=NI election results 2022: The assembly poll in maps and charts |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-61363246 |access-date=9 May 2022 |archive-date=8 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220508172246/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-61363246 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Since 1998, Northern Ireland has had [[devolution|devolved]] government within the United Kingdom, presided over by the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and a cross-community government (the [[Northern Ireland Executive]]). The UK Government and UK Parliament are responsible for [[reserved and excepted matters]]. Reserved matters comprise listed policy areas (such as [[civil aviation]], [[units of measurement]], and [[human genetics]]) that Parliament may devolve to the Assembly some time in the future. Excepted matters (such as [[international relations]], taxation and elections) are never expected to be considered for devolution. On all other governmental matters, the Executive together with the 90-member Assembly may legislate for and govern Northern Ireland. Devolution in Northern Ireland is dependent upon participation by members of the Northern Ireland executive in the [[North/South Ministerial Council]], which coordinates areas of cooperation (such as agriculture, education, and health) between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Additionally, "in recognition of the Irish Government's special interest in Northern Ireland", the [[Government of Ireland]] and [[Government of the United Kingdom]] co-operate closely on non-devolved matters through the [[British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference]].

Elections to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] are by [[single transferable vote]] with five Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) elected from each of 18 [[List of parliamentary constituencies in Northern Ireland|parliamentary constituencies]]. In addition, eighteen representatives (Members of Parliament, MPs) are elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|lower house of the UK parliament]] from the same constituencies using the [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] system. However, not all of those elected take their seats. Sinn Féin MPs, currently seven, refuse to take the oath to serve the King that is required before MPs are allowed to take their seats. In addition, the upper house of the UK parliament, the [[House of Lords]], currently has some 25 appointed [[List of Northern Ireland members of the House of Lords|members from Northern Ireland]].

[[File:Belfast City Hall 2.jpg|thumb|[[Belfast City Hall]], Northern Ireland]]
The [[Northern Ireland Office]] represents the UK Government in Northern Ireland on reserved matters and represents Northern Ireland's interests within the UK Government. Additionally, the Republic's government also has the right to "put forward views and proposals" on non-devolved matters about Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Office is led by the [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], who sits in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]].

<!-- Commented out: [[File:StormontChamber.JPG|thumb|right|[[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Assembly Chamber]] at [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Stormont]].]] -->
Northern Ireland is a distinct legal [[jurisdiction]], separate from the two other jurisdictions in the United Kingdom ([[English law|England and Wales]], and [[Scots law|Scotland]]). Northern Ireland law developed from Irish law that existed before the [[partition of Ireland]] in 1921. Northern Ireland is a [[common law]] jurisdiction and its common law is similar to that in England and Wales. However, there are important differences in law and procedure between Northern Ireland and England and Wales. The body of [[Statutory law|statute law]] affecting Northern Ireland reflects the history of Northern Ireland, including Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], the former [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] and the [[Parliament of Ireland]], along with some Acts of the [[Parliament of England]] and of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] that were extended to Ireland under [[Poynings' Law (confirmation of English statutes)|Poynings' Law]] between 1494 and 1782.

Many people inside and outside Northern Ireland use other names for Northern Ireland, depending on their point of view. Disagreement on names, and the reading of political symbolism into the use or non-use of a word, also attaches itself to some urban centres. The most notable example is whether Northern Ireland's second-largest city should be called [[Derry-Londonderry name dispute|"Derry" or "Londonderry"]].

Choice of language and [[nomenclature]] in Northern Ireland often reveals the cultural, ethnic, and religious identity of the speaker. Those who do not belong to any group but lean towards one side often tend to use the language of that group. Supporters of unionism in the British media (notably ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and the ''[[Daily Express]]'') regularly call Northern Ireland "Ulster".<ref>{{cite news |last=Peterkin |first=Tom |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1509280/IRA-fuel-smuggling-drove-oil-giants-to-abandon-Ulster.html |title=Example of Daily Telegraph use of "Ulster" in text of an article, having used "Northern Ireland" in the opening paragraph |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=31 January 2006 |access-date=16 June 2010 |archive-date=1 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501041920/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1509280/IRA-fuel-smuggling-drove-oil-giants-to-abandon-Ulster.html |url-status=live}}</ref> Many media outlets in the Republic use "North of Ireland" (or simply "the North"),<ref name=Abortion-in-the-North-of-Ireland/><ref name=Calls-for-More-Supports-in_Norths-Schools/><ref name=RTE-does-not-stop-people-in-the-North/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30741054.html |title='Abortion drone' delivers pills to the North from Ireland |work=[[Irish Examiner]] |date=21 June 2016 |access-date=21 June 2016 |archive-date=13 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200913225532/https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30741054.html |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Philip |last=Ryan |url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/varadkar-considers-travel-ban-but-wont-stop-northsouth-travel-39048435.html |title=Varadkar considers travel ban but won't stop North/South travel |work=Irish Independent |date=21 June 2016 |access-date=21 June 2016 |archive-date=17 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200317171705/https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/varadkar-considers-travel-ban-but-wont-stop-northsouth-travel-39048435.html |url-status=live}}</ref> as well as the "Six Counties".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.todayfm.com/uncategorized/gaa-confirm-500-allow-allianz-league-matches-six-counties-1200507 |title=GAA confirm 500 allowed into Allianz League matches in six counties |publisher=[[Today FM]] |first=Stephen |last=Doyle |date=25 May 2021 |access-date=4 June 2021 |archive-date=4 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210604004353/https://www.todayfm.com/uncategorized/gaa-confirm-500-allow-allianz-league-matches-six-counties-1200507 |url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' has also used "the North".<ref>{{cite news |first1=Andrew |last1=Testa |first2=Megan |last2=Specia |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/world/europe/northern-ireland-brexit-border.html |title=Example of New York Times use of "the North" in text of an article (fifth paragraph), having used "Northern Ireland" earlier |work=The New York Times |date=15 October 2018 |access-date=15 October 2018 |archive-date=15 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015181509/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/world/europe/northern-ireland-brexit-border.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

Government and cultural organisations in Northern Ireland often use the word "Ulster" in their title; for example, the [[University of Ulster]], the [[Ulster Museum]], the [[Ulster Orchestra]], and [[BBC Radio Ulster]].

Although some news bulletins since the 1990s have opted to avoid all contentious terms and use the official name, Northern Ireland, the term "the North" remains commonly used by broadcast media in the Republic.<ref name=Abortion-in-the-North-of-Ireland>{{cite news |url=https://www.newstalk.com/podcasts/highlights-from-moncrieff/abortion-north-ireland |title=Abortion in the North of Ireland: Grainne Teggart campaigns manager for Amnesty International NI joins Sean to discuss the problems around abortion in the North of Ireland |publisher=[[Newstalk]] |date=3 June 2020 |access-date=3 June 2020 |archive-date=28 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200828040106/https://www.newstalk.com/podcasts/highlights-from-moncrieff/abortion-north-ireland |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=Calls-for-More-Supports-in_Norths-Schools>{{cite news |url=https://www.highlandradio.com/2020/09/10/calls-for-more-supports-in-norths-schools-after-covid-cases/ |title=Calls for more supports in North's schools after Covid cases |publisher=Highland Radio |date=10 September 2020 |access-date=10 September 2020 |archive-date=13 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200913230345/https://www.highlandradio.com/2020/09/10/calls-for-more-supports-in-norths-schools-after-covid-cases/ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=RTE-does-not-stop-people-in-the-North>{{cite news |first=John |last=Monaghan |url=http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2018/07/14/news/rte-head-of-sport-says-broadcaster-does-not-stop-people-in-the-north-watching-gaelic-games-1382277/ |title=RTÉ head of sport says broadcaster does not stop people in the north watching gaelic games |work=The Irish News |date=14 July 2018 |access-date=14 July 2018 |quote=RTÉ is a '32-county broadcaster' and 'do not stop people in the north watching gaelic games', its new head of sport has said...

====Unionist====
* '''Ulster''', strictly speaking, refers to the province of [[Ulster]], of which six of nine historical counties are in Northern Ireland. The term "Ulster" is widely used by unionists and the British press as shorthand for Northern Ireland, and is also favoured by [[Ulster nationalism|Ulster nationalists]].{{efn|Examples of usage of this term include [[Radio Ulster]], [[Ulster Orchestra]] and [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]]; political parties such as the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]'; paramilitary organisations including the [[Ulster Defence Association]] and [[Ulster Volunteer Force]]; and political campaigns such as "[[Ulster Says No]]" and "[[Save Ulster from Sodomy]]".}} In the past, calls have been made for Northern Ireland's name to be changed to Ulster. This proposal was formally considered by the Government of Northern Ireland in 1937 and by the UK Government in 1949 but no change was made.<ref>Parliamentary Reports of the Parliament of Northern Ireland, Volume 20 (1937) and ''The Times'', 6 January 1949; C.M. 1(49) – UK Cabinet meeting held on 12 January 1949. C.M. 1(49). – See also [[Alternative names for Northern Ireland]]</ref>
* '''The Province''' refers to the historic Irish province of Ulster but today is used by some as shorthand for Northern Ireland. The [[BBC]], in its editorial guidance for ''Reporting the United Kingdom'', states that "the Province" is an appropriate secondary synonym for Northern Ireland, while "Ulster" is not. It also suggests that "people of Northern Ireland" is preferred to "British" or "Irish", and the term "mainland" should be avoided in reporting about Great Britain and Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite web |title=Editorial Policy, Guidance Note |publisher=BBC |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/editorialguidelines/page/guidance-uk-full#style-and-language |access-date=20 April 2012 |date=n.d. |archive-date=3 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303233555/http://www.bbc.co.uk/editorialguidelines/page/guidance-uk-full#style-and-language |url-status=live}} "The term "province" is often used synonymously with Northern Ireland and it is normally appropriate to make secondary references to "the province"."</ref>

====Nationalist====
* '''North of Ireland''' – used to avoid using the name given by the British-enacted Government of Ireland Act 1920.
* '''The Six Counties''' ({{lang|ga|na Sé Chontae}}) – the Republic of Ireland is similarly described as the Twenty-Six Counties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sinnfein.ie/history |title=Sinn Féin usage of "Six Counties" |publisher=[[Sinn Féin]] |date=14 August 1969 |access-date=16 June 2010 |archive-date=14 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614042448/http://www.sinnfein.ie/history |url-status=live}}</ref> Some of the users of these terms contend that using the official name of the region would imply acceptance of the legitimacy of the Government of Ireland Act.

The volcanic activity which created the Antrim Plateau also formed the geometric pillars of the [[Giant's Causeway]] on the north Antrim coast. Also in north Antrim are the [[Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge]], [[Mussenden Temple]] and the [[Glens of Antrim]]. Northern Ireland was covered by an [[ice sheet]] for most of the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]] and on numerous previous occasions, the legacy of which can be seen in the extensive coverage of [[drumlin]]s in Counties Fermanagh, Armagh, Antrim and particularly Down.

The centrepiece of Northern Ireland's geography is [[Lough Neagh]], at {{convert|151|sqmi|km2|0}} the largest freshwater lake both on the island of Ireland and in the [[British Isles]]. A second extensive lake system is centred on Lower and Upper [[Lough Erne]] in Fermanagh. The largest island of Northern Ireland is [[Rathlin Island|Rathlin]], off the north Antrim coast. [[Strangford Lough]] is the largest inlet in the British Isles, covering {{cvt|150|km2|sqmi|0}}.

There are substantial uplands in the [[Sperrin Mountains]] (an extension of the [[Caledonian orogeny|Caledonian mountain belt]]) with extensive gold deposits, the [[granite]] [[Mourne Mountains]] and the [[basalt]] [[Antrim Plateau]], as well as smaller ranges in [[County Armagh|South Armagh]] and along the Fermanagh–Tyrone border. None of the hills are especially high, with [[Slieve Donard]] in the dramatic Mournes reaching {{convert|850|m|ft|0}}, Northern Ireland's highest point. Belfast's most prominent peak is [[Cavehill]].

The Lower and Upper [[River Bann]], [[River Foyle]] and [[River Blackwater (Northern Ireland)|River Blackwater]] form extensive fertile lowlands, with excellent [[arable land]] also found in North and East Down, although much of the hill country is marginal and suitable largely for animal husbandry. The valley of the [[River Lagan]] is dominated by Belfast, whose metropolitan area includes over a third of the population of Northern Ireland, with heavy urbanisation and industrialisation along the Lagan Valley and both shores of [[Belfast Lough]].

Although counties are no longer used for local governmental purposes, they remain a popular means of describing where places are. They are officially used while applying for an [[Irish passport]], which requires one to state one's county of birth. The name of that county then appears in both Irish and English on the passport's information page, as opposed to the town or city of birth on the United Kingdom passport. The [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] still uses the counties as its primary means of organisation and fields representative teams of each [[GAA county]]. The original system of [[License plates of Northern Ireland|car registration numbers]] largely based on counties remains in use. In 2000, the [[Big Number Change#Northern Ireland|telephone numbering system]] was restructured into an 8-digit scheme with (except for Belfast) the first digit approximately reflecting the county.

The county boundaries still appear on Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland Maps and the Philip's Street Atlases, among others. With their decline in official use, there is often confusion surrounding towns and cities which lie near county boundaries, such as Belfast and [[Lisburn]], which are split between counties Down and Antrim (the majorities of both cities, however, are in Antrim).

In March 2018, ''The Sunday Times'' published its list of Best Places to Live in Britain, including the following places in Northern Ireland: [[Ballyhackamore]] near Belfast (overall best for Northern Ireland), Holywood, County Down, Newcastle, County Down, Portrush, County Antrim, Strangford, County Down.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.irishpost.com/life-style/five-places-in-northern-ireland-included-in-best-places-to-live-in-britain-list-151651 |title=Five places in Northern Ireland included in Best Places to Live in Britain list – The Irish Post |first=Ryan |last=Price |access-date=5 August 2018 |archive-date=13 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210413211215/https://www.irishpost.com/life-style/five-places-in-northern-ireland-included-in-best-places-to-live-in-britain-list-151651 |url-status=live}}</ref>

A 2008 survey found that 57% of Protestants described themselves as British, while 32% identified as Northern Irish, 6% as Ulster, and 4% as Irish. Compared to a similar survey in 1998, this shows a fall in the percentage of Protestants identifying as British and Ulster and a rise in those identifying as Northern Irish. The 2008 survey found that 61% of Catholics described themselves as Irish, with 25% identifying as Northern Irish, 8% as British, and 1% as Ulster.

People born in Northern Ireland are, with some exceptions, deemed by UK law to be [[British nationality law|citizens of the United Kingdom]]. They are also, with similar exceptions, entitled to be [[Irish nationality law|citizens of Ireland]]. This entitlement was reaffirmed in the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]] between the British and Irish governments, which provides that:

<blockquote>...it is the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose, and accordingly [the two governments] confirm that their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments and would not be affected by any future change in the status of Northern Ireland.</blockquote>

[[File:Predominant passport held northern ireland.png|thumb|2011: Map of most commonly held passport]]
As a result of the Agreement, the [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution of the Republic of Ireland]] was amended. The current wording provides that people born in Northern Ireland are entitled to be Irish citizens on the same basis as people from any other part of the island.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/?docID=243 |title=Department of the Taoiseach |publisher=Taoiseach.gov.ie |access-date=16 June 2010 |archive-date=1 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701034610/http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/?docID=243 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Neither government, however, extends its citizenship to all persons born in Northern Ireland. Both governments exclude some people born in Northern Ireland, in particular persons born without one parent who is a British or Irish citizen. The Irish restriction was given effect by the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|twenty-seventh amendment to the Irish Constitution]] in 2004. The position in UK nationality law is that most of those born in Northern Ireland are UK nationals, whether or not they so choose. Renunciation of British citizenship requires the payment of a fee, currently £372.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/697987/Gov_uk_fees_revision_2018.pdf |title=Home Office Immigration & Nationality Charges 2018 |publisher=[[Home Office]] |date=6 April 2018 |access-date=12 September 2018 |archive-date=30 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530035148/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/697987/Gov_uk_fees_revision_2018.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref>

Under the [[Belfast Agreement|Good Friday Agreement]], Irish and [[Ulster Scots dialect|Ulster Scots]] (an Ulster dialect of the [[Scots language]], sometimes known as ''Ullans''), are recognised as "part of the cultural wealth of Northern Ireland".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nio.gov.uk/agreement.pdf |title=The Agreement |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003065655/http://www.nio.gov.uk/agreement.pdf |archive-date=3 October 2011}}&nbsp;{{small|(204&nbsp;KB)}}</ref> The Irish Language Act of 2022 also legislated commissioners for both Irish and Ulster Scots.<ref name=":0" />

Two all-island bodies for the promotion of these were created under the Agreement: ''[[Foras na Gaeilge]]'', which promotes the Irish language, and the [[Ulster Scots Agency]], which promotes the Ulster-Scots dialect and culture. These operate separately under the aegis of [[the North/South Language Body]], which reports to the [[North/South Ministerial Council]].

The [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] in 2001 ratified the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. Irish (in Northern Ireland) was specified under Part III of the Charter, with a range of specific undertakings about education, translation of statutes, interaction with public authorities, the use of placenames, media access, support for cultural activities, and other matters. A lower level of recognition was accorded to Ulster-Scots, under Part II of the Charter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/report/EvaluationReports/UKECRML3_en.pdf |title=Council of Europe Charter monitoring report, 2010 |access-date=7 August 2013 |archive-date=10 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010150121/https://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/report/EvaluationReports/UKECRML3_en.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref>

{{Main|Irish language in Northern Ireland|Ulster Irish}}

The Irish language ({{langx|ga|an Ghaeilge}}), or ''Gaelic'', is the second most spoken language in Northern Ireland and is a native language of Ireland.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ryan |first=James G. |title=Irish Records: Sources for Family and Local History |publisher=Flyleaf Press |year=1997 |page=[https://archive.org/details/irishrecordssour0000ryan_s8k7/page/40 40] |isbn=978-0-916489-76-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/irishrecordssour0000ryan_s8k7/page/40}}</ref> It was spoken predominantly throughout what is now Northern Ireland before the [[Ulster Plantations]] in the 17th century and most place names in Northern Ireland are [[anglicised]] versions of a Gaelic name. Today, the language is often associated with Irish nationalism (and thus with Catholics). However, in the 19th century, the language was seen as a common heritage, with Ulster Protestants playing a leading role in the [[Gaelic revival]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=28 January 2013 |title=Presbyterians and the Irish Language Roger Blaney (Ulster Historical Foundation/The Ultach Trust, £6.50) ISBN 0-901905-75-5 |url=https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/presbyterians-and-the-irish-language-roger-blaney-ulster-historical-foundationthe-ultach-trust-6-50-isbn-0-901905-75-5/ |access-date=12 June 2020 |website=History Ireland |archive-date=12 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200612171721/https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/presbyterians-and-the-irish-language-roger-blaney-ulster-historical-foundationthe-ultach-trust-6-50-isbn-0-901905-75-5/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 2021 census, 12.4% (compared with 10.7% in 2011) of the population of Northern Ireland claimed "some knowledge of Irish" and 3.9% (compared with 3.7% in 2011) reported being able to "speak, read, write and understand" Irish.<ref name="Census 2011"/><ref name="2022 Language">{{cite web |title=Main statistics for Northern Ireland Statistical bulletin – Language |url=https://www.nisra.gov.uk/system/files/statistics/census-2021-main-statistics-for-northern-ireland-phase-1-statistical-bulletin-language.pdf |website=NISRA |access-date=22 September 2022 |archive-date=22 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220922093432/https://www.nisra.gov.uk/system/files/statistics/census-2021-main-statistics-for-northern-ireland-phase-1-statistical-bulletin-language.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> In another survey, from 1999, 1% of respondents said they spoke it as their main language at home.<ref name = "Survey-NorthernIreland">Northern Ireland LIFE & TIMES Survey: [http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/1999/Community_Relations/MAINLANG.html What is the main language spoken in your own home?] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610101441/http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/1999/Community_Relations/MAINLANG.html |date=10 June 2011 }}</ref>

The dialect spoken in Northern Ireland, Ulster Irish, has two main types, East Ulster Irish and Donegal Irish (or West Ulster Irish),<ref name="pipex1">{{cite web |url=http://www.ultach.dsl.pipex.com/english/faqs.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416045904/http://www.ultach.dsl.pipex.com/english/faqs.htm |archive-date=16 April 2009 |title=Frequently-Asked Questions about the Irish Language |publisher=Ultach |access-date=7 February 2012}}</ref> is the one closest to [[Scottish Gaelic]] (which developed into a separate language from Irish Gaelic in the 17th century). Some words and phrases are shared with Scots Gaelic, and the dialects of east Ulster – those of [[Rathlin Island]] and the [[Glens of Antrim]] – were very similar to the dialect of [[Argyll]], the part of Scotland nearest to Ireland. The dialects of Armagh and Down were also very similar to the dialects of Galloway.

The use of the Irish language in Northern Ireland today is politically sensitive. The erection by some [[Local government in Northern Ireland|district councils]] of bilingual street names in both English and Irish,<ref>The Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 (No. 759 (N.I. 5))[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Primary&PageNumber=25&NavFrom=2&parentActiveTextDocId=1011237&activetextdocid=1011254] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200409203049/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1995/759/part/crossheading/street-names-and-numbering-of-buildings|date=9 April 2020}}</ref> invariably in predominantly nationalist districts, is resisted by unionists who claim that it creates a "chill factor" and thus harms community relationships. Efforts by members of the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] to legislate for some official uses of the language have failed to achieve the required cross-community support. In May 2022, the UK Government proposed a bill in the House of Lords to make Irish an official language (and support Ulster Scots) in Northern Ireland and to create an Irish Language Commissioner.<ref>{{Cite web |date=25 May 2022 |title=UK to make Irish an official language in Northern Ireland |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-moves-to-make-irish-language-official-in-northern-ireland/ |access-date=28 May 2022 |website=POLITICO |language=en-US |archive-date=27 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220527151739/https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-moves-to-make-irish-language-official-in-northern-ireland/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3168/publications]{{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220529205121/https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3168/publications|date=29 May 2022}} Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Bill [HL].

{{Main|Ulster Scots dialect}}

Ulster Scots comprises varieties of the [[Scots language]] spoken in Northern Ireland. For a native English speaker, "[Ulster Scots] is comparatively accessible, and even at its most intense can be understood fairly easily with the help of a glossary."<ref name = "Poilin-BBC">Aodan Mac Poilin, 1999, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/learning/history/stateapart/agreement/culture/support/cul2_c011.shtml "Language, Identity and Politics in Northern Ireland"] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200821033808/http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/learning/history/stateapart/agreement/culture/support/cul2_c011.shtml |date=21 August 2020 }} in Ulster Folk Life Vol. 45, 1999</ref>

Along with the Irish language, the Good Friday Agreement recognised the dialect as part of Northern Ireland's unique culture and the [[St Andrews Agreement]] recognised the need to "enhance and develop the Ulster Scots language, heritage and culture".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nio.gov.uk/st_andrews_agreement.pdf |title=St Andrews Agreement |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104144328/http://www.nio.gov.uk/st_andrews_agreement.pdf |archive-date=4 November 2006}}&nbsp;{{small|(131&nbsp;KB)}}</ref>

At the time of the 2021 census, approximately 1.1% (compared to 0.9% in 2011) of the population claimed to be able to speak, read, write and understand Ulster-Scots, while 10.4% (compared to 8.1% in 2011) professed to have "some ability".<ref name="Census 2011"/><ref name="2022 Language"/><ref name = "Survey-NorthernIreland"/>

====Sign languages====

{{Main|Northern Ireland Sign Language|Irish Sign Language|British Sign Language}}

The most common [[sign language]] in Northern Ireland is [[Northern Ireland Sign Language]] (NISL). However, because in the past Catholic families tended to send their deaf children to schools in Dublin{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} where [[Irish Sign Language]] (ISL) is commonly used, ISL is still common among many older deaf people from Catholic families.

Irish Sign Language (ISL) has some influence from the French family of sign language, which includes [[American Sign Language]] (ASL). NISL takes a large component from the British family of sign language (which also includes [[Auslan]]) with many borrowings from ASL. It is described as being related to Irish Sign Language at the [[syntactic]] level while much of the [[lexicon]] is based on [[British Sign Language]] (BSL).<ref name="Janzen">{{cite book |last=Janzen |first=Terry |title=Topics in Signed Language Interpreting: Theory And Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ylfJtF3vQUwC |access-date=22 June 2008 |year=2005 |publisher=[[John Benjamins Publishing Company]] |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-90-272-1669-4 |oclc=60742155 |pages=256 & 265 |archive-date=13 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210413214608/https://books.google.com/books?id=ylfJtF3vQUwC |url-status=live}}</ref>

Unlike most areas of the United Kingdom, in the last year of primary school, many children sit entrance examinations for [[Grammar schools in the United Kingdom|grammar schools]]. [[Integrated Education|Integrated schools]], which attempt to ensure a balance in enrolment between pupils of Protestant, Roman Catholic, and other faiths (or none), are becoming increasingly popular, although Northern Ireland still has a primarily ''de facto'' religiously segregated education system. In the primary school sector, 40 schools (8.9% of the total number) are integrated schools and 32 (7.2% of the total number) are [[Gaelscoileanna]] (Irish language-medium schools).

As with the island of Ireland as a whole, Northern Ireland has one of the youngest populations in Europe and, among the four UK nations, it has the highest proportion of children aged under 16 years (21% in mid-2019).<ref>{{cite web |title=Population estimates for the UK, England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland: mid-2019 |url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/bulletins/annualmidyearpopulationestimates/mid2019estimates#ageing |website=ons.gov.uk |publisher=Office for National Statistics |access-date=3 April 2022}}</ref>

In the most recent full academic year (2021–2022), the region's school education system comprised 1,124 schools (of all types) and around 346,000 pupils, including:
* 796 primary schools with 172,000 pupils;
* 192 post-primary schools with 152,000 pupils;
* 126 non-grammar post-primary schools with 86,000 pupils;
* 66 grammar schools with 65,000 pupils;
* 94 nursery schools with 5,800 pupils;

Northern Ireland has underdeveloped transport infrastructure, with most infrastructure concentrated around Greater Belfast, Greater Derry, and Craigavon. Northern Ireland is served by three airports—[[Belfast International Airport|Belfast International]] near [[Antrim, County Antrim|Antrim]], [[George Best Belfast City Airport|George Best Belfast City]] integrated into the railway network at [[Sydenham railway station, Northern Ireland|Sydenham]] in East Belfast, and [[City of Derry Airport|City of Derry]] in County Londonderry. There are upgrade plans to transform the railway network in Northern Ireland including new lines from Derry to Portadown and Belfast to Newry, though it will take the best part of 25 years to deliver.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-66297150 |access-date=26 July 2023 |title=All-Island Rail Review: Londonderry to Portadown line recommended |work=BBC News |date=25 July 2023 |archive-date=26 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230726083037/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-66297150 |url-status=live }}</ref> There are major seaports at [[Larne]] and [[Port of Belfast|Belfast]] which carry passengers and freight between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Passenger railways are operated by [[NI Railways]]. With [[Iarnród Éireann]] (Irish Rail), [[NI Railways]] co-operates in providing the joint [[Enterprise (train)|Enterprise]] service between [[Dublin Connolly]] and [[Belfast Grand Central station|Belfast Grand Central]]. The whole of Ireland has a mainline railway network with a [[Track gauge in Ireland|gauge of {{cvt|5|ft|3|in|mm}}]], which is unique in Europe and has resulted in distinct rolling stock designs. The only preserved line of this gauge on the island is the [[Downpatrick and County Down Railway]], which operates heritage steam and diesel locomotives. Main railway lines linking to and from [[Belfast Grand Central station|Belfast Grand Central Station]] and Lanyon Place railway station are:
* The [[Belfast–Derry railway line|Derry Line]] and the Portrush Branch.
* The [[Larne Town railway station|Larne]] Line
* The [[Bangor railway station (Northern Ireland)|Bangor]] Line
* The [[Newry railway station|Newry]]/[[Portadown railway station|Portadown]] Line

The Derry line is the busiest single-track railway line in the United Kingdom, carrying 3 million passengers per annum, the Derry-Londonderry Line has also been described by Michael Palin as "one of the most beautiful rail journeys in the world".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/michael-palins-favourite-railway-line-between-coleraine-and-derry-in-northern-ireland-set-to-re-open-following-upgrade/35227689.html |access-date=26 July 2023 |title=Michael Palin's favourite railway line - between Coleraine and Derry in Northern Ireland |newspaper=Belfasttelegraph.co.uk |date=18 November 2016 |archive-date=26 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230726073856/https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/michael-palins-favourite-railway-line-between-coleraine-and-derry-in-northern-ireland-set-to-re-open-following-upgrade/35227689.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Main motorways are:
* [[M1 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M1]] connecting Belfast to the south and west, ending in [[Dungannon]]
* [[M2 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M2]] connecting Belfast to the north. An unconnected section of the [[M2 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M2]] also by-passes [[Ballymena]]

Additional short motorway spurs include:
* [[M12 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M12]] connecting the [[M1 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M1]] to [[Portadown]]
* [[M22 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M22]] connecting the [[M2 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M2]] to near [[Randalstown]]

* [[M5 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M5]] connecting Belfast to [[Newtownabbey]]

The cross-border road connecting the ports of [[Larne]] in Northern Ireland and [[Rosslare Harbour]] in the Republic of Ireland is being upgraded as part of an EU-funded scheme. [[European route E01]] runs from Larne through the island of Ireland, Spain, and Portugal to [[Seville]].

The [[Ulster Cycle]] is a large body of prose and verse centring on the traditional heroes of the [[Ulaid]] in what is now eastern Ulster. This is one of the four major cycles of [[Irish mythology]]. The cycle centres on the reign of [[Conchobar mac Nessa]], who is said to have been the king of Ulster around the 1st century. He ruled from [[Emain Macha]] (now Navan Fort near Armagh), and had a fierce rivalry with queen [[Medb]] and king Ailill of Connacht and their ally, [[Fergus mac Róich]], former king of Ulster. The foremost hero of the cycle is Conchobar's nephew [[Cúchulainn]], who features in the [[epic poetry|epic prose/poem]] ''An [[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]'' (The Cattle Raid of Cooley, a ''[[casus belli]]'' between Ulster and [[Connaught]]).

The demise of the Parliamentary Party stands in direct parallel to the just as rapidly diminishing power of its symbols. The green flag and 'God save Ireland' began to be discredited as symbols of constitutional nationalism and, instead, the symbols of revolutionary nationalism gained popularity as the majority of the Irish people identified themselves with the political aims of the Easter revolutionaries. The use of symbols made apparent that the occurrences of 1916 initiated a new epoch in Irish history much in the same as the Union of 1801 and the Famine of 1845–8 did. Both the national flag and the national anthem of present-day Ireland drive origins directly from the Rising. At first, it still appeared as if the revolutionaries would take over the old symbols because on the roof of their headquarters, the Dublin General Post Office, a green flag with the harp was hoisted next to the republican tricolour although with the inscription 'Irish Republic'.
