According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 136,453 people.{{PH census|current}}

Carcar City is bordered to the north by the town of [[San Fernando, Cebu|San Fernando]], to the west are the towns of [[Barili]] and [[Aloguinsan]], to the east is the [[Cebu Strait]], and to the south is the town of [[Sibonga, Cebu|Sibonga]].

==History==
Carcar was known as "Kabkad" or "Sialo" before Spanish colonization.{{cn|date=July 2024}} It became a town in 1599. Carcar is considered one of the oldest towns in Cebu, with its Spanish influence lasted more than 300 years ago.

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
{{Hatnote|For further information, see [[League of Cities of the Philippines v. COMELEC]].}}

In July 2007, the municipality of Carcar was converted into a component city of the province of Cebu after ratification of Republic Act 9436.

On November 18, 2008, [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] ruled that the cityhood charters of Carcar and 15 other cities as unconstitutional as a result of a petition filed by the [[League of Cities of the Philippines]]. A year later, on December 22, Carcar and 15 other municipalities regained their status as cities again after the court reversed its November 18, 2008, ruling. On August 23, 2010, the court reinstated its ruling on November 18, 2008, causing Carcar and 15 cities to revert to municipalities. Finally on February 15, 2011, Carcar and the other 15 municipalities regained their cityhood status.

In 2013, after a six year legal battle, the [[League of Cities of the Philippines]] acknowledged and recognized the cityhood of Carcar and 15 other cities on July 19, 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=16 new cities recognized as LCP members (Archived)|url=http://archive.sunstar.com.ph/tacloban/local-news/2013/07/19/16-new-cities-recognized-lcp-members-293321|accessdate=March 6, 2018|publisher=Sun Star News|date=July 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=League finally recognizes 16 'unqualified' cities|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/34247-league-cities-philippines-recognizes-new-cities|accessdate=March 6, 2018|work=Rappler|date=July 19, 2013}}</ref>
