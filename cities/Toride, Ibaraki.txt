==History==
Toride developed in the [[Edo period]] as a [[shukuba|post-town]] on the [[Mito Kaidō]] highway connecting [[Edo]] with [[Mito, Ibaraki|Mito]] and as a nexus for water-borne traffic on the Tone River; however, the name is thought to derive from an ancient fort constructed by [[Taira no Masakado]] in the [[Heian period]]. The area was part of ancient [[Shimōsa Province]], but was transferred to the newly created Ibaraki prefecture after the [[Meiji restoration|Meiji Restoration]]. Toride town was created with the establishment of the modern municipalities' system on April 1, 1889. It was elevated to city status on October 1, 1970.<ref name="toride-hp">{{cite web |url=https://www.city.toride.ibaraki.jp/seisaku/shise/shokai/profile/ayumi/ayumi2011-2014.htmll |title= わがまち取手市のあゆみ(2011年から2019年)|location= Japan|language= ja}}</ref> On March 28, 2005, the neighboring town of [[Fujishiro, Ibaraki|Fujishiro]] (from [[Kitasōma District, Ibaraki|Kitasōma District]]) was merged into Toride, nearly doubling its size.<ref name="toride-hp"/>
