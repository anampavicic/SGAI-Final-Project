==History==
The area of Ikeda was part of ancient [[Settsu Province]]. It was known as "Kureha no Sato" since ancient times, and even today, vestiges can be seen in the place names and names of shrines and temple with ancient foundations in the site. In the latter half of the [[Heian period]], a ''[[shōen]]'' landed estate called Kurehanoshō was established, and it came to be called "Ikeda" around the end of the [[Kamakura period]]. Ikeda Castle, the residence of the Settsu [[Ikeda clan]], was built during the [[Nanboku-chō period]], but was abandoned during the [[Sengoku period]] when [[Araki Murashige]] defeated the Ikeda clan in 1574, and moved the castle to Itami. During the [[Edo Period]], the area was largely part of the holdings of [[Asada Domain]], and was famous for ''Ikeda-zumi'' (Ikeda [[charcoal]]) traded by Ikeda merchants. In [[Japanese tea ceremony|cha no yu]] Ikeda-zumi is loved because of its high quality even today. 

The village of Ikeda was established with the creation of the modern municipality system on April 1, 1889. It was raised to town status on August 10, 1935. The town was developed as a [[commuter town]] by the [[Hankyu Railway]], whose founder Kobayashi Ichizo (Itsuo) was a resident and major landowner. Ikeda was raised to city status on  April 29, 1939. 

On June 8, 2001, the [[Ikeda school massacre]] occurred in this city. A man entered an elementary school and fatally stabbed eight children in the school. Many pupils have suffered [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. To avoid flashback memories of the massacre and to improve school security, the buildings were remodeled and subsequently occupied in April 2004. On September 14, 2004, [[Mamoru Takuma]] was executed for the murders.

==Government==
Ikeda has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 22 members. Ikeda contributes one member to the [[Osaka Prefectural Assembly]]. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Osaka 9th district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]]. 

==Economy==
The southwestern part of the city is home to the headquarters and factories of [[Daihatsu]] and Toyosu, the Ikeda office of [[Ricoh]], and the Osaka Airport Factory of Daiichiya Baking. In addition, Goshun Sake Brewery, which inherited the tradition of Ikeda Sake, which was as famous as "Itami Sake" in the middle of the Edo period, is still in existence. Many [[Hankyu]] affiliated companies, including Hankyu Hanshin Holdings, have their headquarters and head offices here. There are also two regional wholesale markets, the Maruike Regional Wholesale Market and the Marukita Regional Wholesale Market, located near Osaka International Airport. The Hosokawa district of northern Ikeda is one of Japan's four major producers of garden trees, with a history of more than 400 years.
