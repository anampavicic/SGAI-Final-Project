'''Caloocan''', officially the '''City of Caloocan''' ({{langx|fil|Lungsod ng Kalookan}}; {{IPA|tl|kalɔˈʔokan|IPA}}), is a [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] in [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 1,661,584 people{{PH census|current}} making it the [[List of cities in the Philippines|fourth-most populous city in the Philippines]].

Caloocan is divided into two geographical locations with a total combined area of {{convert|5,333.40|ha|sp=us}}, a result of the 1949 expansion of [[Quezon City]], which absorbed much of its territory. It was formerly part of the [[Rizal (province)|Province of Rizal]] in southern Luzon. It comprises what is known as the [[Administrative divisions of Metro Manila#Districts|CAMANAVA]] area along with the cities of [[Malabon]], [[Navotas]] and [[Valenzuela, Metro Manila|Valenzuela]].

South Caloocan is bordered by [[Manila]], Quezon City, Malabon, Navotas and Valenzuela. The presence of commercial and industrial activities combined with residential areas make it a highly urbanized central business district and a major urban center in the Northern District of Metropolitan Manila.<ref name="Comprehensive Land Use Plan Report, City of Caloocan (1995-2020)">{{Cite web|url=https://kupdf.net/download/comprehensive-land-use-plan-report-city-of-caloocan-1995-2020_59f32907e2b6f51031a8a79c_pdf|title=Comprehensive Land Use Plan Report, City of Caloocan (1995-2020) - Free Download PDF|website=kupdf.net}}</ref> North Caloocan shares its border with Quezon City and Valenzuela, [[Marilao]], [[Meycauayan]] and [[San Jose del Monte]] in the province of [[Bulacan]], and [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Rodriguez]] in the province of Rizal. It is composed of mostly residential subdivisions and extensive resettlement areas with scattered distribution of industrial estates mostly within road transit points and intersections.<ref name="Comprehensive Land Use Plan Report, City of Caloocan (1995-2020)" />

== Etymology ==
Caloocan as a [[toponym]] comes from the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] words ''lo-ok'' that translates to "[[bay]]",<ref name="RizalProvinceDirectory1934">{{Cite book |last=Salonga |first=Isayas |url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/philamer/aar6353.0001.001 |title=Rizal Province directory |publisher=[[University of Michigan]] Digital Collections |year=1934 |volume=1 |location=[[Manila]]|accessdate=May 1, 2024}}</ref>{{rp|page=[https://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/philamer/aar6353.0001.001/61?rgn=full+text&view=image 61]}} ''sulok'' that means "corner" suggested by its location between the ends of the present-day [[Malabon]] and [[Tondo, Manila]], and ''kalook-lookan'' (or ''kaloob-looban'') meaning "innermost area".<ref name="Caloocan History" /> The city's name is colloquially spelled '''Kalookan'''. Historically, it was called '''Kaloogan''', meaning "interior territory," which evolved from the old Tagalog word "loog" (synonymous with "loob," meaning "inside"). The "g" sound could have shifted to the "k" sound in [[Tagalog phonology|Tagalog phonetics]] (e.g. baksak → bagsak), leading to the present name of the city. 

There is a mixed preference over the preferred spelling of the city's name. Variation, and the apparent confusion over the spelling, came about during the early 1970s, when a resolution was adopted by the municipal board, requiring the city departments to use the name "Kalookan." However, execution of the resolution was interrupted due to [[Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos|martial law]] imposed nationwide in September 1972. In 1988, Councilor Aurora Asistio-Henson proposed Resolution No. 006, aiming to promote Filipino nationalism by enforcing the spelling "Kalookan" in all city departments and establishments. Despite this, the change was met with opposition from residents, business owners, and officials. Former representative and mayor Virgilio Robles deemed the move illegal, asserting that the city's name is spelled as "Caloocan" according to the city charter.<ref name="ra3278">{{cite PH act|chamber=RA|number=3278|title=An Act Creating the City of Caloocan|url=https://lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1969/ra_5502_1969.html|date=June 17, 1961 |accessdate=May 6, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=RA |number=5502|title=An Act Revising Republic Act Numbered Thirty-Two Hundred and Seventy-Eight Otherwise Known as the Charter of the City of Caloocan |url=https://lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1969/ra_5502_1969.html|date=June 21, 1969 |accessdate=May 6, 2022}}</ref> Although confusion persists, the general inclination in the city is towards "Caloocan," as evidenced by the official logo and favored by many barangays, schools, and newspapers.

==History==
[[File:20th Kansas Volunteers marching through Caloocan at night.jpg|left|thumb|The ammunition train and reserves of the 20th Kansas Volunteers, Col. Frederick R. Funston, marching through Caloocan at night after the battle of February 10.]]

===Spanish colonial era===
Originally, Caloocan was the area where the old town of [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]] and [[Malabon|Tambobong]] met, located along the shores of Dagat-Dagatan, a crescent-shaped inland lagoon to the west. The settlement along the shore was called "Aromahan", or "Espina" to the Spaniards, and was separated from Manila Bay by a narrow ridge from Tondo towards an opening in [[Navotas|Kinabutasan]] leading to the sea.<ref name="The Role of Kalookan in the Nation's Quest for Freedom">{{cite web |last1=Joaquin |first1=Agapito |title=The Role of Kalookan in the Nation's Quest for Freedom |url=http://sangandaan.net/kalookan/P1A1TOC.htm |access-date=April 26, 2020}}</ref>

By the late 1700s, the fishermen of Aromahan have expanded towards a hill east of Dagat-Dagatan. This naturally stony hill was called "Kaloogan", meaning "interior territory." With Aromahan relegated to the periphery, this hilltop area was also settled by oppressed people from Tondo, becoming the new center of the community by 1802. To the east was a vast stretch of [[Imperata cylindrica|cogon-covered]] land. Eventually called "Kalaanan", meaning flat grassland in old Tagalog, this area is now generally known as Grace Park.<ref name="The Role of Kalookan in the Nation's Quest for Freedom" />

Caloocan became a municipality when it was separated from Tondo in 1815. Its original territory extended to the foothills of [[Marikina]], [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]] and [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Montalban]] to the east; [[Tinajeros, Malabon|Tinajeros]], [[Tanza, Navotas|Tanza]], and Tala rivers to the north; [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan del Monte]], [[San Francisco del Monte]], [[Sampaloc, Manila|Sampalok]], [[Santa Cruz, Manila|Santa Cruz]] and Tondo in the south; and Dagat-dagatan and Aromahan to the west.<ref name="Caloocan History">{{Cite web|url=https://caloocancity.gov.ph/about-us/history/ |title=History of Caloocan |website=City of Caloocan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yodisphere.com/2021/08/Caloocan-City-History.html |title=History of Caloocan City - El Pueblo de Caloocan Provincial de Manila {{!}} Metro Manila Philippines|date=August 2021 |accessdate=May 6, 2022|website=yodisphere.com}}</ref> The local government building was set up on the relatively well-settled portion just above Libis Espina. The old Aromahan chapel was finally abandoned and a new [[Caloocan Cathedral|church was built]] facing the municipal hall. To escape the Spanish authorities, many from the area abandoned the town proper and sought refuge in the grasslands of [[Balingasa|Balintawak]] and Pugad-Lawin, in which the people fought the landlords of Hacienda de Maysilo for terrestrial rights, which went on for almost a hundred years.<ref name="The Role of Kalookan in the Nation's Quest for Freedom" /><ref name="Caloocan History" />

====The Philippine revolution====
{{See also|Philippine Revolution}}
Caloocan is historically significant because it was the center of activities for the [[Katipunan]], the secret militant society that launched the [[Philippine Revolution]] during the Spanish occupation of the Philippines. In a house in Caloocan, secret meetings were held by [[Andrés Bonifacio]] and his men, and it was in the city's perimeters where the first armed encounter took place between the Katipunan and the Spaniards. The revolution erupted after the "[[Cry of Pugad Lawin|Cry of Balintawak]]" led by Andres Bonifacio against their oppressors on August 30, 1896.

===American invasion era===
[[File:Philippine Island - Luzon Island - NARA - 68156741.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Caloocan, circa 1930s]]

In 1899, the people of Caloocan showed resistance to coming to terms with the Americans, who were bent on extending their supremacy over the country. The men of Caloocan fought the new invaders on February 23, 1899, however victory eluded the local troops on the pretext of [[Antonio Luna]]'s rift with [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]'s loyalists.<ref name="Caloocan History" /> The city then saw heavy fighting in the [[Philippine–American War]], at the [[Battle of Caloocan]] and the [[Second Battle of Caloocan]].

In 1901, under the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American regime]], Caloocan, previously a part of the [[Manila (province)|province of Manila]], became one of the municipalities of the newly established province of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]].<ref>{{Cite PH act|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l2485 |date=June 11, 1901 |title=An Act Extending the Provisions of the Provincial Government Act to the Province of Rizal |chamber=Act |number=942|access-date=June 12, 2022}}</ref> Due to the consolidation of several municipalities in 1903, [[Novaliches]], then an independent municipality, became part of Caloocan pursuant to Act No. 942,<ref>{{cite PH act|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l89ad|chamber=Act|number=942|date=October 12, 1903|accessdate=May 12, 2022|title=An Act Reducing the Thirty-Two Municipalities of the Province of Rizal to Fifteen}}</ref> as amended by Act Nos. 984 and 1008 of the [[Philippine Commission]].

===Japanese occupation era===
In 1942, Caloocan was one of the municipalities of Rizal merged alongside Manila and Quezon City to form the [[City of Greater Manila]] as an emergency measure by President [[Manuel L. Quezon]].<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=EO|number=400, s. 1942|title=Creating the City of Greater Manila|date=January 1, 1942|accessdate=August 24, 2022|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1942/01/01/executive-order-no-400-s-1942/}}</ref><ref name="emb">{{cite web|title=Historical Background|url=http://ncr.emb.gov.ph/historicalbackground/|website=DENR - Environment Management Bureau - National Capital Region|access-date=May 28, 2022}}</ref> It regained its pre-war status as a municipality of Rizal when the City of Greater Manila was dissolved effective August 1, 1945.<ref name="eo58">{{cite PH act|chamber=EO|number=58, s. 1945|title=Reducing the Territory of the City of Greater Manila|date=July 26, 1945|accessdate=August 24, 2022|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1945/07/26/executive-order-no-58-s-1945/}}</ref>

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
[[File:Aacaloocanjf.JPG|thumb|left|The old Caloocan City Hall in Poblacion district was the seat of local government for Caloocan from 1952 to 2017.]]
In 1961, after Republic Act No. 3278 was approved by the [[Congress of the Philippines|Philippine Congress]], a plebiscite was conducted.<ref name="ra3278" /> Caloocan was officially inducted into cityhood on February 16, 1962.<ref name="Caloocan History" />

Caloocan remained a city of the province of Rizal until November 7, 1975, when it became a part of the National Capital Region or [[Metro Manila]], by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 824.<ref name="PD824">{{cite PH act|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1975/pd_824_1975.html|chamber=PD|number=824|title=Creating the Metropolitan Manila and the Metropolitan Manila Commission and for Other Purposes |date=November 7, 1975 |access-date=July 10, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312121648/http://lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1975/pd_824_1975.html|archive-date=March 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Caloocan once encompassed a much larger, contiguous area. The districts of [[Barangays of Quezon City|Balintawak]], [[Quezon City#La Loma|La Loma]] and [[Novaliches]] were once part of Caloocan. Balintawak is a historic district because it was the original site of the "Cry of Pugad Lawin" (Unang Sigaw sa Balintawak) at a location called "Kang-kong" near [[Melchora Aquino|Tandang Sora]]'s house. Novaliches was an expansive sector with some hillsides that served as meeting places and hideouts for [[Andrés Bonifacio]] and the ''Katipunan''.

During the American occupation, there was a consolidation of several municipalities. Caloocan annexed the neighboring town of Novaliches on October 12, 1903, as stated in the Act No. 942 of the [[Philippine Commission]], bringing its total area to about {{convert|1,500|ha|sp=us}}.<ref name="Caloocan History"/><ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=942|title=An Act Reducing the Thirty-two Municipalities of the Province of Rizal to Fifteen| url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l89ad| publisher=Lawyerly| date=October 12, 1903| accessdate=June 7, 2024}}</ref> When Commonwealth Act No. 502 created [[Quezon City]] in 1939, Caloocan ceded 1,500 hectares of land from the barrios or sitios of Bagubantay (Bago Bantay), Balintauac (Balintawák), [[Balingasa]], Kaingin, Kangkong (present-day Apolonio Samson), La Loma, Malamig, Matalahib (present-day Santo Domingo), Masambong, Galas, San Isidro, San José, Santol and [[Tatalon]].<ref>Philippine Commission of the Census, Census of the Philippines, 1939, vol. 1, part 4: Rizal (Manila: Bureau of Printing, 1940), p. 5</ref> Instead of opposing the transfer, Caloocan residents willingly gave the land in the belief it will benefit the country's new [[Capital of the Philippines|capital city]].<ref>{{cite PH act|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1939/10/12/commonwealth-act-no-502/|chamber=CA|number=502|title=An Act to Create Quezon City|date=October 12, 1939|access-date=April 21, 2022|archive-date=March 8, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230308195829/https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1939/10/12/commonwealth-act-no-502/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Geography==
Caloocan is divided into two non-contiguous areas with a total combined area of {{convert|53.334|sqkm|sp=us}}. South Caloocan, with an area of {{convert|13.625|sqkm|sp=us}}, is bordered on the south by [[Manila]], on the east by [[Quezon City]], on the west by [[Navotas]], on the north-northwest by [[Malabon]], and on the north by [[Valenzuela, Metro Manila|Valenzuela]]. North Caloocan, with an area of {{convert|39.709|sqkm|sp=us}}, shares its border on the south-southeast by [[Quezon City]], on the southwest by [[Valenzuela, Metro Manila|Valenzuela]], on the north by [[Marilao]], [[Meycauayan]] and [[San Jose del Monte]] in the province of [[Bulacan]], and on the northeast by [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Rodriguez]] in the province of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]].<ref name="Caloocan History" />

===Topography===
[[File:Topo Map Caloocan South.png|thumb|Elevation map of south Caloocan]]
South Caloocan, where most commercial and industrial establishments are found, lies on generally flat and highly accessible land, with slopes ranging from 0–3%. The topography gradually changes from gently to moderately sloping to rolling along the [[North Luzon Expressway]], with slopes ranging from 3–18%. The highest point at {{convert|35.00|m|sp=us}} above sea level can be found in this area, while the lowest point is in the southern part of Dagat-Dagatan at about {{convert|0.993|m|sp=us}} above mean sea level.<ref name="Caloocan 2017-2025 Local Climate Change Action Plan">{{cite web|url=http://caloocancity.gov.ph/images/pdfs/Caloocan-City-2017-2025-LCCAP.pdf|title=Climate change action plan|date=2016|website=caloocancity.gov.ph|access-date=July 11, 2020|archive-date=July 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717175130/http://caloocancity.gov.ph/images/pdfs/Caloocan-City-2017-2025-LCCAP.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

North Caloocan is characterized by gently to steeply undulating to rolling topography with slopes ranging from 3–18%, mostly seen in the northern and central portion, gradually transforming into a southward trend of flat lands down to the southwestern tip of the boundary. Being accessible to major roads, many industrial and residential subdivisions have been developed on this near-level land.<ref name="Caloocan 2017-2025 Local Climate Change Action Plan" />

===Geology===
The geologic formation of the two portions of Caloocan varies in type and characteristics. and are specifically classified as quaternary [[alluvium]], [[tuff]] and tuffaceous sediment, [[pyroclastic flow]] deposit, and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]]. The formation on the eastern half of Metropolitan Manila extending to the coastline of Manila Bay and including a greater part of South Caloocan is the quaternary [[alluvium]], which consists of unconsolidated stream-deposited sediments that include sand, silt, clay and gravel.<ref name="Caloocan 2017-2025 Local Climate Change Action Plan" />

Eastward of South Caloocan, large areas consisting of [[tuff]] and tuffaceous sediment can be traced, spreading towards the whole eastern side of Metro Manila. [[Pyroclastic flow]] deposit or [[igneous rocks]] formed by the lithification of ash flow are likewise present in some northern fringes of South Caloocan and in most parts of North Caloocan. On the northeast borders of North Caloocan, [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate rocks]] were traced, crossing Tala Estate and extending to the province of Bulacan and the [[La Mesa Dam and Reservoir|La Mesa Watershed]].<ref name="Caloocan 2017-2025 Local Climate Change Action Plan" />

Soil found in both areas of Caloocan predominantly falls under the Novaliches Series, covering 96% of the total land area of the city. The Novaliches Series is composed of reddish brown soil, friable in consistency and granular in structure. Spherical concretions are present in the subsoil and underneath is tuffaceous material of varying degrees of disintegration and weathering. This tuffaceous material is exposed by extensive erosion in some places.<ref name="Caloocan 2017-2025 Local Climate Change Action Plan" />

===Surface drainages===
Caloocan has surface waters that either have natural courses (creeks and rivers) or were constructed to serve as drainages to remove excess water from soil surfaces. South Caloocan has about {{convert|5.0|km|mi|sp=us|adj=mid|-long}} open drainage canals that serve mainly the reclamation area comprising Kaunlaran Village (Dagat-Dagatan Development Project) and nearly {{convert|11.3|km|mi|sp=us|adj=mid|-long}} natural surface water coursing through the different natural river systems. These include the [[Tullahan River|Tinajeros-Tullahan River]] along the Caloocan–Valenzuela boundary; Maligaya Creek within [[La Loma Cemetery]] and crossing [[Rizal Avenue|Rizal Avenue Extension]]; Casili Creek which terminates in Estero de Maypajo, and Cantarilla/Panaca Creek along the Caloocan–Malabon boundary. In North Caloocan, all surface waters consist of natural streams, the longest being the Meycauayan-Marilao River dividing Caloocan and Bulacan. Others include the Bagong Silang River, Tala, Camarin, Pasong Malapad, and Bagumbong Creeks crossing multiple subdivisions, for {{convert|52.7|km|sp=us}} long within the city's territorial boundaries.<ref name="Caloocan 2017-2025 Local Climate Change Action Plan" />

Currently, Caloocan has 193 [[barangay]]s divided into [[Legislative districts of Caloocan|3 legislative districts]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/nation/2021/05/28/2101288/duterte-splits-caloocan-3-districts|title = Duterte splits Caloocan into 3 districts| website=[[The Philippine STAR]] }}</ref> The 1st District is composed of 64 barangays, which include Barangays 1 to 4, 77 to 85, 132 to 164 in South Caloocan and Barangays 165 to 177 in North Caloocan. The 2nd District is composed of 118 barangays, which include Barangays 5 to 76 and 86 to 131, all in South Caloocan. 3rd District, which was created in 2021, includes 11 barangays in North Caloocan that were formerly part of the 1st District, which include Barangays 178 to 188.<ref name="ra11545" />

The city uses a hybrid system for its barangays, further dividing the cities into 16 zones. Among the cities in Metro Manila, only Manila, Pasay and Caloocan implement the so-called "Zone Systems". A zone is a group of barangays in a district. Although a zone is considered a subdivision in the local government units, the people do not elect a leader for the zone in a popular election similar to the normal barangay or local elections as the system is merely for statistical purposes. Furthermore, all barangays have corresponding numbers but only a few—mostly in Caloocan's northern part—have corresponding names. However, the names of barrios and districts do not necessarily coincide with the perimeters of barangays. The barangays in southern Caloocan are generally smaller compared to their northern counterparts.

Prior to its split in 2024, Barangay 176 or [[Bagong Silang]] was the most populous barangay in the country with a population of 261,729 people or 15.75% of the total population of Caloocan.{{PH census|2020}} This was due to the continuous influx of informal settler families through relocation programs since the 1970s. As a result, there have been calls by residents to subdivide Bagong Silang into seven distinct barangays.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bajo |first1=Ramil |last2=Galupo |first2=Rey |title=Mayor supports move to split Caloocan barangay into seven |url=https://www.philstar.com/metro/2013/09/17/1219131/mayor-supports-move-split-caloocan-barangay-seven |access-date=April 29, 2020 |work=The Philippine Star|date=September 17, 2013}}</ref> Finally, a plebiscite held on August 31, 2024, resulted in the division of Bagong Silang into six distinct barangays: 176-A, 176-B, 176-C, 176-D, 176-E, and 176-F.<ref name="bs2024" />

[[Barangay 76, Caloocan|Barangay 76]], meanwhile, is the least populous barangay in Metro Manila with a population of 2. It used to be an informal settlement and its entire {{convert|2.8|ha|adj=on}} area is now predominated by retail buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pcij.org/article/10939/the-smallest-barangay-in-ncr-has-2-registered-residents-but-with-210-voters|title=Barangay with 2 residents prepares for elections; it has 210 voters|first=Elyssa|last=Lopez|date=October 28, 2023|publisher=Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism}}</ref>

===Territorial disputes===
Caloocan has two unresolved boundary disputes. Its dispute with [[San Jose del Monte]], [[Bulacan]], docketed as G.R. No. 142601 dated October 23, 2006, particularly encompasses portions of Pangarap Village and apparently Bankers Village 2 that are once part of Tala Estate. The lack of jurisdiction of the Commission on Settlement of Land Problems (COSLAP) resulted to the nullification of its decision.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=GR|number=142601|title=National Housing Authority vs. Commission on the Settlement of Land Problems, Municipality of San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, Sps.

Moreover, the city governments of Caloocan and [[Malabon]] signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in 2014 to develop {{convert|80|ha}} of disputed land located within Caloocan's Libis Baesa area and Malabon's Barangay Potrero. The MOU preempted any court decisions on the dispute that began in 2001, when Malabon, upon its conversion to a highly urbanized city, took control over lands formerly under Caloocan's jurisdiction.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/metro/2014/06/18/1335945/caloocan-malabon-settle-land-row|title=Caloocan, Malabon settle land row|first1=Ramil|last1=Bajo|first2=Rey|last2=Galupo|date=June 18, 2014|accessdate=May 1, 2024|work=The Philippine Star}}</ref>

However, the whole Caloocan city police force was recently sacked after a series of crimes, including killings and robberies, were committed by its members. However, instead of dismissing the erring police officers, they were scheduled to be retrained by then [[Philippine National Police]] [[Chief of the Philippine National Police|Chief]] [[Ronald dela Rosa]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/09/15/1739397/ncrpo-relieves-caloocan-city-police-force?nomobile=1|title=NCRPO relieves Caloocan City police force|website=Philstar.com|date=September 15, 2017|accessdate=September 6, 2023}}</ref>
