== History ==
Gangneung was the home of the [[Yemaek|Yemaek people]] in ancient times and became the land of [[Wiman Joseon]] in 129 BC. In 128 BC, Nam Ryeo, the army officer of Yaekam, punished Wujang of Wiman Korea and became the territory of the [[Han dynasty]]. In the 14th year of [[Goguryeo]] Muchheon (313), it entered Goguryeo territory.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.gn.go.kr/eng/contents.do?key=1340 |title = Origin and history |publisher = Gangneung city office |access-date = 2018-02-09}}</ref>

In 639, Silla occupied this place and ruled it as a 'Sogyeong' ({{Korean|labels=no|소경}}). In 658, King Moo-yeong abolished the Sogyeong and made an arsenal to send the todok, because it was adjacent to Malgal. In 757, it was renamed Sungju and restored it in 776.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.gn.go.kr/www/contents.do?key=693 |script-title=ko:유래와 연혁 |publisher = Gangneung city office |access-date = 2018-02-09}}</ref>

It was renamed Myungju again during the Goryeo period, and it was under the jurisdiction the north of Chuncheon in the 14th year of Sungjong (995). It separated the Hamgyeong-do from the Gangeung and called it Gangneung-do, but it has always been the center of administration and military. At the beginning of the Joseon Dynasty, it called to Hwadangdo and Wonchundo and rename Gangneung by the name of Gangwon Province in the 5th year of King Sejong (1423).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://gangneung.grandculture.net/Contents?local=gangneung&dataType=01&contents_id=GC00302498 |script-title = ko:강릉의 역사 |publisher = Digital Gangneung Culture Encyclopedia |access-date = 2018-02-09 |archive-date = 2018-02-10 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180210002523/http://gangneung.grandculture.net/Contents?local=gangneung&dataType=01&contents_id=GC00302498 |url-status = dead }}</ref>

Some areas have been incorporated into Yangyang since 1945, and Gangneung City was established in 1995 as the areas of Gangneung and Myeongju merged.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.law.go.kr/lsInfoP.do?lsiSeq=2644&lsId=null&chrClsCd=010102#0000 |script-title=ko:경기도남양주시등33개도농복합형태의시설치등에관한법률 |publisher =  Korea Ministry of Government Legislation |date = 1994-08-23 |access-date = 2018-02-09}}</ref>

=== Festivals ===
Gangneung has numerous festivals. The biggest and most famous is the Gangneung [[Gangneung Danoje|Dano Festival]] (강릉단오제) at the [[Dano (Korean festival)|Dano]] fairground near the Namdae River. In 1967, the Gangneung Dano Festival was designated Korean National Immaterial Cultural Heritage No. 13. On November 11, 2005, it was designated by [[UNESCO]] as one of the "Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity". Nowadays, it is a combination of several commemoration rites and traditional plays. A highlight is the traditional Gwanno Mask Dance (Gwanno Gamyeongeuk), which is only performed at this festival.

In addition to well established festivals like the Dano, there are several newer festivals in Gangneung, such as the IJAF ([[International Junior Art Festival]]), which enjoys great popularity. The IJAF is a cultural festival for youth from all over the world. The festival includes both performances of the participating groups and a diversified cultural program demonstrating the essence of Korean culture. Since 2002, the IJAF has taken place at Gyeongpo Beach in the end of July. There is also the Gyeongpo Rock Festival, which was established in 2006. This festival, mostly attracting young people, offers young Korean bands from the Gangneung area a stage for their performances. The Gangneung Coffee festival, which began in 2009, is an annual coffee-tasting festival in which a variety of coffee vendors showcase coffee drinks as well as coffee machinary. In the festival are also some smaller, non-coffee vendors, as well as arts and crafts stalls. As of 2023, it is being held within the [[Gangneung Olympic Park]].

=== Museum ===
There are a number of historical remains and museums in Gangneung. The most prominent being the [[Ojukheon|Ojukheon Museum]], which is named after a special black bamboo growing in this area. It was the birthplace of the famous artist, calligrapher and poet Shin Saimdang (1504–1551) (whose image is on the 50,000 won note), and her son, the scholar Yulgok (1536–1584) (whose image is on the South Korean 5,000 won note). In 1963, the Ojukheon Museum was designated as National Cultural Heritage No. 165. It includes one of the oldest wooden buildings in Korea. The Hwanhee and Fantapia Museums, established in 2013, opened anew in November 2020<ref>{{Cite web|title=환희컵 박물관|url=http://www.cupmuseum.org/|access-date=2020-11-24|website=www.cupmuseum.org}}</ref> Housed in a new structure of contemporary architecture it is the only cup museum in Asia. The museum's collection contains 2,000 cups from 70 countries. Currently, 1,500 are on display.
