|title=The Amul trinity |last=DAMODARAN |first=HARISH  |date=13 September 2012 |website=thehindubusinessline.com |publisher= |access-date=12 January 2021 |quote=The original credit goes to Dalaya â€” something that Kurien always acknowledged, and reiterated when the former passed away on September 12, 2004. While Patel dealt with the farmers, and Dalaya took charge of the technical and internal affairs of the dairy, "my role was only in marketing, external affairs and handling politicians, bureaucrats and other establishment people," the ever-frank Kurien admitted at the time. In Anand, it was said that if Patel was the Father of Amul, Kurien was the Son, and Dalaya the Holy Ghost.}}</ref> This city hosts the Head Office of Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd (GCMMF), the [[National Dairy Development Board|NDDB]] of India,the [[Institute of Rural Management Anand|Institute of Rural Management Anand (IRMA)]], Vidya Dairy and the [[Anand Agricultural University]].
