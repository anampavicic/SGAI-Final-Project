'''Davao Region''', formerly called '''Southern Mindanao''' ({{lang-ceb|Rehiyon sa Dabaw}}; {{lang-fil|Rehiyon ng Davao}}), is an [[Regions of the Philippines|administrative region in the Philippines]], designated as '''Region XI'''.<ref>[http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/listreg.asp List of Regions]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013150956/http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/listreg.asp |date=October 13, 2008 }}, [National Statistical Coordination Board].</ref> It is situated at the southeastern portion of [[Mindanao]] and comprises five [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]]: [[Davao de Oro]], [[Davao del Norte]], [[Davao del Sur]], [[Davao Oriental]], and [[Davao Occidental]].

The region encloses [[Davao Gulf]], and its regional center and largest city is [[Davao City]]. ''Dávao'' is the [[Spanish language|Hispanicized pronunciation]] of ''daba-daba'', the Bagobo word for "fire".

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Etymology==
Many historians believe that the name ''Davao'' is the mixture of the three names that three different tribes, the earliest settlers in the region, had for the [[Davao River]]. The [[Manobo]]s, an aboriginal tribe, referred to the Davao Rivers as ''Davohoho''. Another tribe, the [[Bagobo]]s, referred to the river as ''Davohaha'', which means "fire", while another tribe, the Guiangan tribe, called the river as ''Duhwow''.

==History==
The history of the region dates back to the times when various tribes occupied the region. It is believed that the [[Lumad peoples#Manobo|Manobos]], [[Lumad peoples#Mandaya|Mandayas]], [[Kalagan people|Kalagans]], [[Lumad peoples#Mansaka|Mansakas]], and Bagobos occupied the area. These are the same tribes that created the small settlements and communities that eventually became Mindanao.

===Maguindanao era===
The Davao Region was once part of [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]] and was called "Pinagurasan" by the [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanaons]]. Early settlers of the region were [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanaons]] and the [[Tausug people|Tausugs]] under the [[Sulu Sultanate|Sultanate of Sulu]]. [[Datu Bago]] was one of the Datus in Davao Gulf who resisted the [[Spanish Empire]] colonization on the region.

===First European contact===
The [[Davao Gulf]] area was the first region in the country that was in contact with the Europeans, with such contacts taking place as early as 16th century. The Portuguese preceded the Spaniards, who were the ones to colonize the region albeit much later, in sighting and visiting the region. In 1512, Francisco Serrano was shipwrecked in the shallow waters and coral reefs of Cape of San Agustín, located in what is now the province of Davao Oriental. In 1538, Francisco de Castro, a Portuguese ship captain, was driven by strong winds to the southeastern coast of Mindanao. He baptized several chieftains in the area.

Around January 1546, [[Francis Xavier]], a [[Jesuit]] priest, left Malacca and went to [[Mollucas|Molucca Islands]], then called the Spice Islands, where the Portuguese had some settlements, and for a year and a half he preached the Gospel to the inhabitants of Amboyna, Ternate, Baranura, and other lesser islands. It is claimed by some{{who|date=March 2020}} that during this expedition he landed on the island of Mindanao, which is confirmed by some writers{{who|date=March 2020}} of the seventeenth century, and in the Bull of canonization issued in 1623. It is also said that he is the one to have preached the Gospel in Mindanao.

===Spanish administration===
For centuries the tribes lived in relative peace until the Spanish, under the adventurous [[Spanish people|Spanish]] businessman Don Jose Oyanguren, arrived in the region in 1847. At that time, the Kalagan Moro chieftain Datu Bago was in control of the area in what is now Davao City. Don Oyanguren attempted to conquer the area which Datu Bago ruled; although he failed at first, the Moro chieftain eventually evacuated his people to live in the areas near [[Mount Apo]]. This is the time the town of [[Davao City|Davao]], then called Nueva Vergara by the Spaniards, was established in the year 1848.

Don Oyanguren attempted to develop the region. Although the Spanish gained the upper hand when they finally controlled the ports of the region, the population of Davao grew very slowly until the arrival of [[Jesuits|Christian missionaries]] in the area in 1890. Unlike the major parts of [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]] and other coastal parts of [[Mindanao]], Spanish rule in Davao lasted only for 50 years, abandoning it in 1898 when the Philippines became independent from Spain, making it among the shortest-lived areas controled by Spain.

===American administration===
After the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898, [[Spanish East Indies#Colonial government|Spanish rule in the region]] ended. Americans then landed in the region and they subsequently developed the regions communications and transportation systems. During this period, private farm ownership grew in the region. [[Japanese people|Japanese]] migration in the region began as two Japanese entrepreneurs, [[Kyosaburo Ohta]] and [[Yoshizo Furukawa]], were finding better agricultural lands for building [[abaca]] and [[coconut]] plantations in the region. The [[Port of Davao]] was opened on 1900, becoming the first Philippine international port to be established in the south.

In 1903 until 1914, the region was one of the districts of the former [[Moro Province]] in Mindanao. After 1914, the province was replaced by an American colonial agency called [[Department of Mindanao and Sulu]], which spanned the entire Mindanao island except Lanao. The agency lasted from 1914 to 1920.

====Wartime Japanese occupation====
In 1942, during [[World War II]], as the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]] began, the region was one of the first among the Philippine regions to be subjected by Japanese occupation. The Japanese immigrants in Davao acted as a [[fifth column]], welcoming the Japanese invaders during World War II. These Japanese were hated by the Moro Muslims and disliked by the Chinese.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sDRlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=R4kNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2656,1332631&hl=en Curtis 1942], p. 4.</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sDRlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=R4kNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2656,1332631&hl=en CURTIS 1942], p. 4.</ref> The Moros were judged as [[Moros during World War II|"fully capable of dealing with Japanese fifth columnists and invaders alike."]]<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oJRRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LWoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2732,2587117&hl=en "80 Japanese Troop Ships Are Sighted Off Luzon" 1941], p. 7.</ref> The Moros were to fight the Japanese invaders when they landed at Davao on Mindanao.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=i1xFAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ELwMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4603,5384970&hl=en AP 1941], p. 1.</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ruEcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=h2QEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3633,7246655&hl=en "SITUATION AT DAVAO OBSCURE AS JAPS LAND" 1941], p. 2.</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2P0oAAAAIBAJ&sjid=C9UEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3421,2464690&hl=en "THE JAPS SWARM AT DAVAO BUT THE SITUATION OBSCURE" 1941], p. 3.</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GnNHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=af4MAAAAIBAJ&pg=5937,4816594&hl=en "Six Japanese Bombers In New Raid On Manila" 1941], p. 13.</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1941/12/22/archives/outrages-cause-anger-flotilla-is-sighted-off-luzons-coast.html THE NEW YORK TIMES 1941], p. 1.</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=luBRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zoQMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6067,2425479&hl=en "Large Force Is Attacking" 1941], p. 58.</ref> The Japanese went back to their ships at night to sleep since the Moros struck so much fear into them, even though the Moros were outnumbered by the Japanese.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VXgtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3JgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2500,438255&hl=en LEE 1942], p. 8.</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3O4qAAAAIBAJ&sjid=GokFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1693,3646589&hl=en LEE 1942], p. 1.</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rNZeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BFMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1233,4394025&hl=en LEE 1942], p. 7.</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JZQpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-MYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3881,736181&hl=en LEE 1942], p. 9.</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9N5eAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jlMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=6736,635472&hl=en Lee 1942], p. 2.</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4e8uAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wdsFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3415,515356&hl=en Lee 1942], p. 25.</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dDIsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6MoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5177,2963057&hl=en Lee 1942], p. 4.</ref> The longest battle of the [[Philippines Campaign (1944–45)|Allied liberation campaign]], the [[Battle of Davao]], took place in 1945. After the war, the region eventually passed to the American hands again for at least almost one year before the formal Philippine independence on July 4, 1946, most of the Japanese living in the region were now integrated in the [[Filipino people|Filipino population]].

===Philippine administration===
====Davao province====
Prior to Philippine independence in 1946, the entire region was a single province called [[Davao (former province)|Davao Province]], with [[Davao City]] serving as its capital. The province was one of the largest provinces in the Philippines during that time, spanning more than {{convert|20,000|km2}}. It lasted from 1920 until 1967, when the province was split into three provinces in May 1967: [[Davao del Norte]], [[Davao del Sur]] and [[Davao Oriental]].<ref name="ChanRobles-RA4867">{{cite web|title=Republic Act No. 4867 - An Act Creating the Provinces of Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur and Davao Oriental|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno4867.html|website=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library|access-date=March 29, 2016|date=May 8, 1967}}</ref> After the division, Davao City was officially named its regional center.

====Southern Mindanao and Davao Region====
Region XI, then known as ''Southern Mindanao'', originally covered 6 provinces ([[Compostela Valley]], [[Davao del Norte]], [[Davao del Sur]], [[Davao Oriental]], [[South Cotabato]] and [[Sarangani]]), and the cities of [[Davao City|Davao]], [[Digos]], [[Panabo]], [[Tagum]], [[Samal, Davao del Norte|Samal]], [[General Santos]] and [[Koronadal]].<ref name="NSCB-SouthernMindanao-Davao">{{cite news|title=Southern Mindanao Is Now All Davao Region|url=http://www.nscb.gov.ph/ru11/statnews/2002/sn0204.htm|access-date=March 29, 2016|work=RDC XI Bulletin|issue=Oct-Dec 2001, Volume 7|publisher=National Statistical Coordination Board|date=January 29, 2002|quote=Southern Mindanao or Region XI is now known as Davao Region and {{sic|comprises |hide=y|of}} four provinces (Compostela Valley, Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur and Davao Oriental) and five cities (Davao, Digos, Panabo, Tagum and the Island Garden City of Samal.

In September 2001, ''Executive Order No. 36'' was enacted which reorganized the regions in Mindanao. {{nowrap|Region XI}}, then known as ''Southern Mindanao'', was renamed ''Davao Region'', and the provinces of South Cotabato and Sarangani, and the cities of General Santos and Koronadal were moved to {{nowrap|[[Soccsksargen|Region XII]]}}.<ref name="NSCB-SouthernMindanao-Davao" /><ref name="GovPH-EO36">{{cite web|title=Executive Order No. 36; Providing for the Reorganization of the Administrative Regions in Mindanao and for Other Purposes|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2001/09/19/executive-order-no-36-s-2001/|website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|access-date=March 29, 2016|location=Malacañang, Manila, Philippines|date=September 19, 2001|quote=SECTION 3.

On October 12, 2022, the Regional Peace and Order Council declared the entire region "insurgency-free" after decades of being a stronghold for the [[Communist insurgency in the Philippines|communist insurgency]], barring some scattered members of the [[New People's Army]] that are left in the region.<ref>{{cite news|last=Zuasola|first=Ferdinand|title=Peace and order council declares Davao Region insurgency-free|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/mindanao/peace-council-declares-davao-region-insurgency-free/|access-date=November 7, 2022 |work=[[Rappler]]|publisher=Rappler Inc.|date=October 13, 2022|location=[[Davao Oriental]], Philippines}}</ref>

Davao Region is the most populous region in Mindanao and the 7th most populous in the country, with a total of 5,243,536 inhabitants in 2020. Davao City, its regional capital, is also the largest city in Mindanao, with an area of 2,444&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, the largest in the country and one of the largest in the world, and has 1,632,991 inhabitants in 2015, making it the third most populous city in the country and the most populous city proper in the entire [[Visayas]]-Mindanao region. [[Metro Davao|Davao Metropolitan Area]], the primary economic and urban build-up area in the region, is also the most populous in the island and the third most populous in the country, with about 2,274,913 inhabitants in that year.

Most of the region's inhabitants speak [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]. [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and [[English language|English]] are also spoken and widely used in schools, businesses, commerce, and industry. In the Davao City Metro Area, a linguistic phenomenon has developed whereby locals have either [[language shift|shifted]] to Filipino or significantly mix Filipino terms and grammar into their Cebuano speech. Minority indigenous groups of the region speak their own languages as well.

[[Chinese Filipino|Chinese]] immigrants are widespread in the region, with a considerable population based in [[Davao City]]. [[Davao Chinatown]] is one of the two defined Chinatowns in the Philippines, alongside [[Binondo]] in Manila. A considerable population of [[Japanese in the Philippines|Japanese]] are also found in the region, most of them also located in Davao City. Before World War II, Davao was and still is heavily populated by Japanese immigrants and their descendants, with Davao City being touted at one point in its history as the [[Japantown|Little Tokyo]] of the Philippines.

===Religion===
The majority of the region's population are [[Christianity|Christians]], mostly [[Roman Catholic|Catholics]] ({{percentage|3828290|5223802|2}}); and there are also [[Islam|Muslims]] (3.55%), [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] ({{percentage|1355|5223802|2}}), and [[Shinto]]ists living in the region.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Religious Affiliation in the Philippines (2020 Census of Population and Housing) {{!}} Philippine Statistics Authority {{!}} Republic of the Philippines |url=https://psa.gov.ph/content/religious-affiliation-philippines-2020-census-population-and-housing |access-date=2023-08-06 |website=psa.gov.ph}}</ref>

==Economy==
{{stack|float=left|{{PH poverty incidence}}}}
[[File:Davao Skyline.jpg|thumb|right|A view of Davao City as seen in July 2018]]

While the region's economy is predominantly agri-based, it is now developing into a center for agro-industrial business, trade and tourism. Its competitive advantage is in agri-industry as its products, papayas, mangoes, bananas, pineapples, fresh asparagus, flowers, and fish products are exported internationally. The region can be a vital link to markets in other parts of Mindanao, [[Brunei|Brunei Darussalam]] and parts of [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]. There is also a growing call center sector in the region, mostly centered in [[Davao City]].

There is a gradual shift to industrialization as shown with industry's growth rate of 8.1% in 1996. Other economic activities are mining, fishery, forestry and agriculture. Due to the region's rise as the main commercial and industrial hub of Mindanao, many of its workers are oriented to urban services such as putting small-scale businesses and working in commercial industries in thriving urban areas like [[Davao City|Davao]], [[Tagum]], and [[Digos]]. Both private and foreign investors and businessmen are putting up huge business centers in the region, fueling up its commercial growth rate.

The region is also venturing to online business like [[outsourcing]].

===Ports and airport===
The region's principal ports are the Sasa International Seaport in Sasa and Santa Ana Pier in the Chinatown District, both in Davao City; Panabo Seaport in Davao del Norte; and Mati Seaport in Davao Oriental. The former two, both of which are located in [[Port of Davao]] in Davao City, can service both interisland and international shipments. Sasa International Container Port, also located in the Port of Davao, is the busiest in Mindanao.

The international airport in Davao City, [[Francisco Bangoy International Airport]], is the largest and most developed in Mindanao, has the first longest runway in the island, and the third busiest in the country, after [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] and [[Mactan–Cebu International Airport]]. Being the only airport in the island that is currently catering for international destinations, it can handle both domestic and international flights, serving several domestic flights to [[Manila]], [[Cebu City|Cebu]], [[Bacolod]], [[Iloilo City|Iloilo]], [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]] and other major Philippine cities, and international flights to [[Doha]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Manado]], [[Quanzhou]], and [[Singapore]]. Its [[Air Traffic Control Tower|ATC Tower]] is the most advanced in the country.

The region is accessible by land, air and sea. The region has adequate communications facilities, reliable power, and an abundant water supply.

In December 2016, [[Rodrigo Duterte|President Duterte]] helped enter a contract with Chinese investors to create a new port in the region of Isla Verde in Davao.<ref>{{cite news|title=China uses island building skills to develop Duterte's backyard|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-12-20/china-uses-island-building-skills-to-develop-duterte-s-backyard|access-date=December 21, 2016|publisher=Bloomberg news|date=December 21, 2016}}</ref> This involves the creation of three [[artificial islands]] by a set of Chinese companies including CCCC Dredging Group Co.
