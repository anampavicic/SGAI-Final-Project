** {{IPA|pl|ˈradɔm|lang|Pl-Radom.ogg}}
** {{lang-yi|ראָדעם|Rodem}}}} is a city in east-central [[Poland]], located approximately {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} south of the capital, [[Warsaw]]. It is situated on the [[Mleczna River]] in the [[Masovian Voivodeship]]. Radom is the [[List of cities and towns in Poland|fifteenth-largest city in Poland]] and the second-largest in its province with a population of 196,918 (30.06.2023)<ref name="population"/>

For centuries, Radom was part of the [[Sandomierz Voivodeship|Sandomierz Province]] of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the later [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Despite being part of the Masovian Voivodeship, the city historically belongs to [[Lesser Poland]]. It was a significant center of administration, having served as seat of the Crown Council which ratified the [[Pact of Vilnius and Radom]] between Lithuania and Poland in 1401. The [[Nihil novi]] and [[Łaski's Statute]] were adopted by the [[Sejm]] at Radom's Royal Castle in 1505. In 1976, it was a center of the [[June 1976 protests]].

The city is home to the biennial [[Radom Air Show]], the largest [[air show]] in the country, held during the last weekend of August. "Radom" is also the popular unofficial name for a semiautomatic [[FB Vis]] pistol, which was produced from 1935 to 1944 by Radom's [[Łucznik Arms Factory]]. The city continues to produce military firearms for the [[Polish Armed Forces]].

The international Radom Jazz Festival and the International Gombrowicz Theater Festival are held in the city.

== History ==
{{further|Timeline of Radom}}
[[File:Saint Wenceslaus church in Radom 01.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Wenceslaus church, the city's oldest church]]
Radom's original settlement dates back to the 8th–9th century. It was an early medieval town in the valley of the Mleczna River (on the approximate site of present-day ''Old Town''). In the second half of the 10th century, it became a [[Gord (archaeology)|gord]], called ''[[Piotrówka Hill Fort|Piotrówka]]'', which was protected by a [[Defensive wall|rampart]] and a [[moat]]. Due to convenient location on the edge of a large wilderness, and its proximity to the border of [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Mazovia]], Radom quickly emerged as an important administrative center of the early [[Kingdom of Poland]]. ''Piotrówka'' was probably named after St. Peter church, which in 1222 was placed under the authority of a [[Benedictine]] [[Abbey]] in nearby [[Sieciechów, Masovian Voivodeship|Sieciechów]]. The church no longer exists; the oldest still-extant church in Radom is St. Wacław, founded in the 13th century by Prince of Sandomierz [[Leszek I the White]]. The first documented mention of Radom comes from the year 1155, in a [[papal bull|bull]] of [[Pope Adrian IV]] (''villam iuxta Rado, que vocatur Zlauno'', or ''a village near Radom, called Sławno''). By 1233, Radom was the seat of a [[castellan]]. The name of the city comes from the ancient Slavic given name ''Radomir'', and Radom means a ''gord, which belongs to Radomir''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.radom.pl/page/155,historia.html |title=Historia |access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref>
[[File:Church of Saint John the Baptist in Radom 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Saint John the Baptist church, founded by King [[Casimir III the Great]] in the 14th century]]
In the second half of the 13th century, Radom was granted a [[Środa Śląska]] town charter by Prince [[Bolesław V the Chaste]], although no documents exist to confirm the exact date of this event. The town prospered in the 14th century, when in 1350 King [[Kazimierz Wielki]] established the so-called ''New Town'', with a royal castle, a [[defensive wall]], and a town hall. There was also a market square and a [[grid plan]] of the streets, patterned after Gothic German towns. The area of ''New Town'' was 9 [[hectare]]s, and the length of the defensive wall was 1,100 meters. Radom had three gates, named after main merchant roads: ''[[Iłża]] Gate'', ''[[Piotrków Trybunalski]] Gate'', and ''[[Lublin]] Gate''. The defensive wall was further protected by 25 [[fortified tower]]s. ''New Town'' had the [[Church of St. John the Baptist, Radom|Church of John the Baptist]], and the Royal Castle was built between the church and the moat.

In 1364, Radom's obsolete Środa Śląska rights were replaced with more modern [[Magdeburg rights]], and residents gained several privileges as a result.<ref name="Historia miejscowości">{{cite news|url=https://sztetl.org.pl/pl/miejscowosci/r/601-radom/96-historia-miejscowosci/67672-historia-miejscowosci |title=Historia miejscowości |access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref> At that time, Radom was located along the so-called ''Oxen Trail'', from [[Ruthenia]]n lands to [[Silesia]]. In 1376, the city became the seat of a [[starosta]], and entered the period of its greatest prosperity.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.kazimierzwielki.pl/grody/mazowieckie/ |title=Grody mazowieckie |access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref>

===Poland's Golden Age===
King [[Władysław Jagiełło]] granted several privileges to the city. Jagiełło himself frequently travelled from [[Kraków]] to [[Vilnius]], and liked to stay at Radom Castle en route. On March 18, 1401, the [[Pact of Vilnius and Radom]] was signed, which strengthened the [[Polish–Lithuanian union]]. Immediately after the Pact, preparations for the [[Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War]] began. King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] frequently visited Radom, along with his wife, [[Elizabeth of Austria (1436–1505)|Elizabeth of Austria]]. Here, the King would host foreign envoys, from such countries as the [[Crimean Khanate]], the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], and the [[Duchy of Bavaria]]. On November 18, 1489, [[Johann von Tiefen]], the [[Grand Masters of the Teutonic Knights|Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights]], paid homage to King Jagiellon at Radom Castle. [[Mikołaj Radomski]], one of the earliest Polish composers, comes from Radom. In 1468, the complex of a Bernardine church and monastery was founded here by King Jagiellon, with support of the local [[starosta]], Dominik z Kazanowa. The complex was originally made of wood (until 1507).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://diecezja.radom.pl/radom-kosciol-rektoralny-pw-sw-katarzyny-w-radomiu-oo-bernardyni/ |title=RADOM – Kościół rektoralny pw. św.

[[Image:POL Radom castle Nihil novi.jpg|thumb|Plaque at the Radom Castle commemorating the adoption of the ''[[Nihil novi]]'' act in Radom in 1505]]

In 1481, Radom became the residence of Prince [[Saint Casimir|Kazimierz]], the son of King Jagiellon, who ruled the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. The young prince died of [[tuberculosis]], and later became patron saint of both the city of Radom (since 1983), and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Radom]] (since 1992). During the reign of [[Alexander Jagiellon]], the [[Nihil novi]] act was adopted by the Polish [[Sejm]] in a meeting at Radom Castle.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.radomdzisiaj.pl/historia-radomia |title=Historia Radomia |access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref> Furthermore, at the same meeting, the [[Łaski's Statute|first codification of law published in the Kingdom of Poland]] was accepted. Radom was a [[Royal city in Poland|royal city]], [[powiat|county]] seat and [[Castellans of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|castellany]], administratively located in the [[Sandomierz Voivodeship]] in the [[Lesser Poland Province, Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Lesser Poland Province]].<ref>{{cite book|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Województwo sandomierskie w drugiej połowie XVI wieku; Cz.1, Mapy, plany|year=1993|language=pl|location=Warszawa|publisher=[[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN|Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN]]|page=3}}</ref> It remained one of the most important urban centers of the Sandomierz Voivodeship, and was also the seat of the Treasure Tribunal in 1613–1764, which controlled taxation. Several kings visited the city, including [[Stephen Bathory]] and his wife [[Anna Jagiellon]], [[Sigismund III Vasa]], and [[Augustus III of Poland]]. In 1623 many residents died in an epidemic, and in 1628, half of Radom burned in a fire.<ref name="Historia miejscowości"/>

The period of prosperity ended during the [[Deluge (history)|Swedish invasion of Poland]]. The Swedish army captured the city without a fight in November 1655. At first the invaders behaved correctly, as King [[Charles X Gustav]] still sought alliances within the Polish-Lithuanian nobility; the situation changed, however, in early 1656, when anti-Swedish uprisings broke out in southern Lesser Poland and quickly spread across the country. Radom was looted and almost completely destroyed in August 1656. Its population shrank from some 2,000 before the war, to 395 in 1660, with only 37 houses still standing. Swedish soldiers burned the royal castle and the monastery. With the Polish population in decline, the number of Jewish settlers grew by the early 18th century. In 1682 the first [[Piarists]] arrived, and in 1737–1756, opened a college.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.retropedia.radom.pl/kolegium-pijarow/ |title=Kolegium Pijarów |access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref> The 3rd Infantry Regiment of the Polish [[Crown Army]] was stationed in Radom at various times.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gembarzewski|first=Bronisław|title=Rodowody pułków polskich i oddziałów równorzędnych od r. 1717 do r. 1831|year=1925|language=pl|publisher=Towarzystwo Wiedzy Wojskowej|location=Warszawa|pages=26–27}}</ref>

===Late modern era===
[[File:Kolegium Pijarow in Radom 1864.jpg|thumb|left|Piarist College in the 19th century]]
Radom remained within the Sandomierz Voivodeship of the [[Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown]] of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] until the [[Third Partition of Poland]] (1795). For a few years (1795–1809) it was part of the [[Habsburg monarchy|Austrian]] province of [[West Galicia]]. After the Polish victory in the [[Austro-Polish War]] of 1809, it was part of the Polish [[Duchy of Warsaw]], which named it capital of the [[Radom Department]]. From 1815 the city belonged to [[Russian Partition|Russian-controlled]] [[Congress Poland]], remaining a regional administrative center. In 1816–1837 it was the capital of the Sandomierz Voivodeship, whose capital, despite the name, was at Radom. In 1837–1844 it was the capital of the [[Sandomierz Governorate]], and from 1844 until the outbreak of [[World War I]], the capital of the [[Radom Governorate]]. The Polish 5th Line Infantry Regiment, which later fought against Russia in the [[November Uprising]], was stationed in Radom.<ref>Gembarzewski, p. 69</ref> The city was an important center of the November Uprising. Its obsolete and ruined fortifications were destroyed upon order of Mayor Józef Królikowski. In the early days of the [[January Uprising]], [[Marian Langiewicz]] visited Radom, preparing the rebellion. In the 19th century, Radom was one of the leading centers of the new art of [[photography]] in partitioned Poland, alongside major cities of Warsaw, [[Gdańsk]], Kraków and Wilno.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kuropatwa|first=Justyna|editor-last1=Kita|editor-first1=Jarosław|editor-last2=Korybut-Marciniak|editor-first2=Maria|year=2017|title=Życie prywatne Polaków w XIX wieku|volume=VI|language=pl|location=Łódź-Olsztyn|publisher=Wydawnictwo [[University of Łódź|Uniwersytetu Łódzkiego]]|page=101|chapter=Moda na fotografię w Gdańsku na tle ziem polskich (do lat sześćdziesiątych XIX wieku)|isbn=978-83-8088-801-2}}</ref> In 1867 a sewage system was built.

During World War I, the city was captured by the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] in July 1915. An Austrian garrison remained until November 1918.

[[File:Radom plany-15.jpg|thumb|City map from 1919]]

In the [[Second Polish Republic]] Radom became part of [[Kielce Voivodeship]]. In 1932 the City County of Radom was created, and the following year, its rail connection with [[Warsaw]] was completed. In the late 1930s, due to the government project known as the [[Central Industrial Area]], several new factories were built; by 1938, the population had grown to 80,000. The city was also a military garrison, serving as headquarters of the 72nd Infantry Regiment.

===World War II===
