'''Lincoln''' is the [[List of capitals in the United States|capital]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Nebraska]] and the [[county seat]] of [[Lancaster County, Nebraska|Lancaster County]]. The city covers {{convert|100.4|sqmi|sqkm|3}} and had an estimated population of 294,757 in 2023. It is the state's [[List of cities in Nebraska|second-most populous city]] and the [[List of United States cities by population|71st-largest in the United States]]. Lincoln is the economic and cultural anchor of the Lincoln Metropolitan and Lincoln-[[Beatrice, Nebraska|Beatrice]] Combined Statistical Areas, home to 361,921 people.

Lincoln was founded in 1856 as the village of Lancaster on the wild [[inland salt marsh|salt marshes]] and arroyos of what became Lancaster County. Renamed after President [[Abraham Lincoln]], it became Nebraska's state capital in 1869. The [[Bertram G. Goodhue]]–designed [[Nebraska State Capitol|state capitol building]] was completed in 1932, and is the nation's second-tallest capitol. As the city is the seat of government for the state of Nebraska, the state and the U.S. government are major employers. The [[University of Nebraska]] was founded in Lincoln in 1869. The university is Nebraska's largest, with 26,079 students enrolled, and the city's third-largest employer. Other primary employers fall into the service and manufacturing industries, including a growing [[high-tech]] sector. The region makes up a part of what is known as the [[Silicon Prairie#Midwest Silicon Prairie|Midwest Silicon Prairie]].

Designated as a "refugee-friendly" city by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] in the 1970s, the city was the 12th-largest resettlement site per capita in the country by 2000. Refugee [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], [[Karen people|Karen]] (Burmese ethnic minority), [[Sudan]]ese and [[Yazidi]] (Iraqi ethnic minority) people, as well as refugees from [[Iraq]], the Middle East and Afghanistan, have resettled in the city. During the 2018–19 school year, [[Lincoln Public Schools]] provided support for about 3,000 students from 150 countries, who spoke 125 different languages.

===Natives===
Before the expansion westward of settlers, the prairie was covered with [[Bouteloua dactyloides|buffalo grass]]. [[Native American tribes in Nebraska|Plains Indians]], descendants of indigenous peoples who occupied the area for thousands of years, lived in and hunted along Salt Creek. The [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]], which included four tribes, lived in villages along the [[Platte River]]. The [[Great Sioux Nation]], including the ''Ihanktowan-Ihanktowana'' and the [[Lakota people|Lakota]], to the north and west, used Nebraska as a hunting and skirmish ground, but did not have any long-term settlements in the state. An occasional buffalo could still be seen in the plat of Lincoln in the 1860s.<ref name="1889 chapter 11" />

===Founding===
[[File:Lincoln, Nebraska, USA (1868).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=|Lincoln, 1868]]

Lincoln was founded in 1856 as the village of Lancaster and became the county seat of the newly created Lancaster County in 1859.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neded.org/files/research/stathand/asect4.htm |title=Counties and County Seats by License Place Prefix Numbers |date=June 8, 2010 |website=Nebraska Databook |publisher=Nebraska Department of Economic Development |access-date=October 18, 2015 |archive-date=October 20, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020053612/http://www.neded.org/files/research/stathand/asect4.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> The village was sited on the east bank of [[Salt Creek (Platte River)|Salt Creek]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/county-city_building.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040702173505/http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/county-city_building.htm |url-status=usurped |archive-date=July 2, 2004 |title=County-City Building, Lincoln, Lancaster County, Nebraska |last=Lincoln Bar Association |date=May 1, 1970 |publisher=Nebraska State Historical Society |access-date=October 18, 2015}}</ref> The first settlers were attracted to the area due to the abundance of salt.

A caucus was formed and the committee, which included Donovan, selected Lancaster as the county seat. The county was named Lancaster. After the passage of the 1862 [[Homestead Acts|Homestead Act]], homesteaders began to inhabit the area.

Construction of University Hall, the first building, began the same year.{{sfn|Hays & Cox|p=234}}

===State capital===
{{See also|Nebraska State Capitol}}
[[File:Nebraska State Capitol (at night, 2016), Lincoln, Nebraska, USA.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=|Nebraska State Capitol]]

Nebraska was granted statehood on March 1, 1867. The capital of the [[Nebraska Territory]] had been [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] since the creation of the territory in 1854. Most of its population lived south of the Platte River. After much of the territory south of the Platte was considered annexation to Kansas, the territorial legislature voted to place the capital south of the river and as far west as possible.{{sfn|Hays & Cox|p=29}} Before the vote to remove the capital from Omaha, Omaha Senator [[J. N. H. Patrick]] made a last-ditch effort to derail the move by having the future capital named after recently assassinated President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Many of the people south of the Platte had been sympathetic to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] cause in the recently concluded [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. It was assumed that senators south of the river would not vote to pass the measure if the future capital was named after Lincoln. In the end, the motion to name the future capital Lincoln was ineffective in blocking the measure and the vote to move the capital south of the Platte was successful, with the passage of the Removal Act in 1867.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nebraskahistory.org/sites/kennard/stathood.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010121161100/http://nebraskahistory.org/sites/kennard/stathood.htm |url-status=usurped |archive-date=January 21, 2001 |title=More about Nebraska statehood, the location of the capital, and the story of the commissioner's home |date=March 20, 2000 |publisher=Nebraska State Historical Society |access-date=October 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/341669/Lincoln |title=Lincoln, Nebraska, United States |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |access-date=October 19, 2015}}</ref>

The Removal Act called for the formation of a Capital Commission to site the capital on state-owned land. On July 18, 1867, the Commission, composed of Governor [[David Butler (Nebraska governor)|David Butler]], Secretary of State [[Thomas Kennard]], and State Auditor [[John Gillespie (auditor)|John Gillespie]], began to tour sites for the new capital. The village of Lancaster was chosen, in part due to its salt flats and marshes.<ref name="founding">{{cite web |url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/publicat/timeline/lincolns_founding.htm |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20061115222934/http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/publicat/timeline/lincolns_founding.htm |url-status=usurped |archive-date=November 15, 2006 |title=Lincoln's Founding |date=January 11, 2006 |publisher=Nebraska State Historical Society |access-date=October 18, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Midwest/Lincoln-History.html |title=Lincoln: History |website=City-Data.com |publisher=Advameg, Inc. |access-date=October 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=McGee |first=Jim |date=February 13, 2022 |title=Jim McKee: The birth of Antelope Park in Lincoln |url=https://norfolkdailynews.com/state/nebraska/jim-mckee-the-birth-of-antelope-park-in-lincoln/article_afe09bfc-8b72-5d58-9546-49b3d7d373f8.html |newspaper=Norfolk Daily News |location=Norfolk, NE |access-date=February 13, 2022 |archive-date=February 13, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220213201033/https://norfolkdailynews.com/state/nebraska/jim-mckee-the-birth-of-antelope-park-in-lincoln/article_afe09bfc-8b72-5d58-9546-49b3d7d373f8.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Lancaster had approximately 30 residents.

Newcomers began to arrive and Lincoln's population grew. The [[Nebraska State Capitol]] was completed on December 1, 1868, a two-story building constructed with native limestone with a central cupola. The [[Thomas P.

In 1888, a new capitol building was constructed on the site of the first to replace the structurally unsound former capitol. The second building was a classical design by architect [[William H.

The worldwide economic depression of 1890 saw Lincoln's population fall from 55,000 to 40,169 by 1900 (per the 1900 census). [[Germans from Russia|Volga-German immigrants from Russia]] settled in the North Bottoms neighborhood and as Lincoln expanded with the growth in population, the city began to annex nearby towns.

As automobile travel became more common, so did the need for better roads in Nebraska and throughout the U.S. In 1911, the Omaha-Denver Trans-Continental Route Association, with support from the [[Good Roads Movement]], established the Omaha-Lincoln-Denver Highway (O-L-D) through Lincoln. The goal was to have the most efficient highway for travel throughout Nebraska, from Omaha to Denver.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ashlandhistoricalsociety.org/Documents/US%206%20-%20O%20L%20D%20pres%20-%2012%20OCT%202013%20-%2049%20pg%20rev.pdf |title=Huebinger's Map & Guide for Omaha-Denver Transcontinental Route (condensed, edited & annotated edition) |last1=Ashland Historical Society |last2=Huebinger |first2=M. |date=October 12, 2013 |publisher=Ashland Historical Society / Saline Ford Historical Preservation Society, Nebraska |access-date=October 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903235447/http://www.ashlandhistoricalsociety.org/Documents/US%206%20-%20O%20L%20D%20pres%20-%2012%20OCT%202013%20-%2049%20pg%20rev.pdf |archive-date=September 3, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 1920, the Omaha-Denver Association merged with the Detroit-Lincoln-Denver Highway Association. As a result, the O-L-D was renamed the Detroit-Lincoln-Denver Highway (D-L-D) with the goal of having a continuous highway from [[Detroit]] to [[Denver]]. The goal was eventually realized by the mid-1920s; {{convert|1,700|mi|km|abbr=on}} of constantly improved highway through six states.<ref name="idot">{{cite web |url=http://www.iowadot.gov/autotrails/dldhighway.html |title=Detroit, Lincoln and Denver (DLD) Highway |publisher=Iowa Department of Transportation |access-date=October 18, 2015}}</ref> The auto route's success in attracting tourists led entrepreneurs to build businesses and facilities in towns along the route to keep up with the demand. In 1924, the D-L-D was designated as [[U.S. Route 6 in Nebraska|Nebraska State Highway 6]]. In 1926, the highway became part of the Federal Highway System and was renumbered U.S. Route 38. In 1931, U.S. 38 was renumbered as a [[U.S. Route 6|U.S. 6]]/U.S. 38 overlap and in 1933, the U.S. 38 route designation was dropped.<ref name="nhhs">{{cite web |url=http://www.transportation.nebraska.gov/docs/NE-Hist-hwy-surv.pdf |title=Nebraska Historic Highway Survey |last1=Mead & Hunt, Inc. |last2=Heritage Research, Ltd. |date=August 2002 |editor1-last=Jacobson |editor1-first=Kent A. |website=Nebraska Department of Roads |publisher=Nebraska State Historical Society / Nebraska Department of Roads |access-date=October 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116010548/http://www.transportation.nebraska.gov/docs/NE-Hist-hwy-surv.pdf |archive-date=January 16, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us6.cfm |title=U.S. 6 – The Grand Army of the Republic Highway |last1=Weingroff |first1=Richard F. |date=November 18, 2015 |department=Highway History |website=Federal Highway Administration |publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation |access-date=August 18, 2016}}</ref>

In 1942, the Lincoln Army Airfield was established at the site. During World War II, the U.S. Army used the facility to train over 25,000 aviation mechanics and process over 40,000 troopers for combat. The Army closed the base in 1945, but the Air Force reactivated it in 1952 during the Korean War. In 1966, after the Air Force closed the base, Lincoln annexed the airfield and the base's housing units.<ref name="airpark" /> The base became the [[Lincoln Airport (Nebraska)|Lincoln Municipal Airport]], and later the Lincoln Airport, under the Lincoln Airport Authority's ownership.

===Revitalization and growth===
[[File:Nighttime skyline of downtown Lincoln, Nebraska, USA (2021, from Arnold Heights Park).jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Skyline, 2021]]

The downtown core retail district from 1959 to 1984 saw profound changes as retail shopping moved from downtown to the suburban Gateway Shopping Mall. In 1956, [[Ameritas|Bankers Life Insurance Company of Nebraska]] announced plans to build a $6 million shopping center next to their new campus on Lincoln's eastern outskirts. Gateway Shopping Center, now called [[Gateway Mall (Lincoln, Nebraska)|Gateway Mall]], opened at 60th and O streets in 1960.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=We're shopping for memories of Hovland-Swanson |url=http://journalstar.com/niche/neighborhood-extra/senior-scene/we-re-shopping-for-memories-of-hovland-swanson/article_1b93d780-c109-5b3c-b0cf-9332134a2e66.html| newspaper=Lincoln Journal Star |location=Lincoln, NE |date=April 13, 2015 |access-date=October 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Gateway Mall emerged where cornfield had existed |url=http://journalstar.com/niche/neighborhood-extra/news/gateway-mall-emerged-where-cornfield-had-existed/article_8b6483bb-1735-59a4-8232-c7346d3035b0.html |newspaper=Lincoln Journal Star |location=Lincoln, NE |date=January 6, 2012 |access-date=October 16, 2015}}</ref> By 1984, 75% of Lincoln's revenue from retail sales tax came from within a one-mile radius of the Mall. The exodus of retail and service businesses led the downtown core to decline and deteriorate.{{sfn|McKee|p=125}}

In 1969, the Nebraska legislature legislated laws for urban renewal. Soon afterward, Lincoln began a program of revitalization and beautification. Most of the urban renewal projects focused on downtown and the near South areas. Many ideas were considered and not implemented. Successes included Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery, designed by [[Philip Johnson]]; new branch libraries, new street lighting, the First National Bank Building and the National Bank of Commerce Building designed by [[I.M. Pei]].{{sfn|McKee|pp=125–128}}

In 1971, an expansion of Gateway Mall was completed. 1974 marked a new assembly facility in Lincoln, a subsidiary of [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] in Japan to produce motorcycles for the North American market.<ref name="MCN 13 Feb 74"/> Lincoln's first woman mayor, [[Helen Boosalis]], was elected in 1975. Mayor Boosalis was a strong supporter of the revitalization of Lincoln with the downtown beautification project being completed in 1978. In 1979, the square-block downtown Centrum was opened and connected to buildings with a skywalk. The Centrum was a two-level shopping mall with a garage for 1,038 cars. With the beautification and urban renewal projects, many historic buildings were razed in the city.{{sfn|McKee|pp=125–128}} In 2007 and 2009, the city of Lincoln received beautification grants for improvements on O and West O Streets, west of the Harris Overpass, commemorating the history of the D-L-D.<ref name="idot" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Lincoln West "O" Historic Highway Project|url=https://www.lincoln.ne.gov/City/plan/mpo/tech/reports/2010/100826/westo.pdf|publisher=City of Lincoln, Nebraska|access-date=May 16, 2015}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
Lincoln, Nebraska, is purportedly the setting of the animated television series ''[[Transformers: Armada]]''. However, this depiction of the city is vastly different than reality, featuring mountains, deserts, and palm trees.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tfarchive.com/comics/dreamwave/guide/?s=armada_11_18 |title="Armada #11-18" |website=TFArchive|access-date=Jan 8, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Lincoln,_Nebraska |title="Lincoln, Nebraska" |website=TFWiki.net|access-date=Jan 8, 2024}}</ref>

In April 2011, a contest held by [[DC Comics]] selected Omaha, Nebraska, as the site of a new issue. However, the Nebraska State Capitol was depicted in the issue, with the writers having confused Lincoln for Omaha.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.nebraska.gov/that-time-superman-mixed-up-omaha-and-lincoln/ |title="That time Superman mixed up Omaha and Lincoln" |website=History Nebraska |date=October 29, 2022 |publisher=State of Nebraska  |access-date=Jan 8, 2024}}</ref>

Lincoln was immortalised in song by [[John Prine]] in his 2018 song Egg & Daughter Nite, Lincoln Nebraska, 1967 (Crazy Bone).
