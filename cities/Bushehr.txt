== Etymology ==
The roots of the name "Bushehr" are uncertain. It is unlikely that it is derived from ''Abū Šahr'' ("father of the city"), a theory which remains popular. It may be an abbreviation of [[Bokht-Ardashir]] ("Ardashir has given"), though this is not backed by conclusive evidence.{{sfn|Perry|2017}}{{sfn|de Planhol|1990}} [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008730547].

== History ==
===Origins===
A number of alleged premodern references to Bushehr, including the first made by an [[Arab]] geographer in 1225, have been disputed as perhaps alluding to the modern city of [[Reishahr]], a harbor 10&nbsp;km to the south, where archaeological evidence points to the presence of a much older settlement.{{sfn|Perry|2017}} Reishahr is also most likely equivalent to the town of Mesambria, a place the [[Greeks]] knew since the campaign of [[Nearchus]] (died 300 BC), and which also has been occasionally identified with Bushehr.{{sfn|de Planhol|1990}}

=== Rise ===
In 1734, the Iranian military commander [[Nader Shah|Nader]] made Bushehr (then still a minor fishing village) the headquarters of the Persian Gulf fleet that he sought to create.{{sfn|de Planhol|1990}}{{sfn|Perry|2017}} This marked the start of Bushehr's rising importance. In order to build a massive warship, Nader even brought heavy wood from [[Mazandaran]]'s forests, which was 1,000&nbsp;km away from Bushehr. The shell of this ship drew notice from European travelers for the next 50 years. The naval aspirations of Nader ended when he was murdered in 1747, but Bushehr continued to serve as a prominent port for at least the following 150 years. Between 1737–1753, the [[Dutch East India Company]] ran a trading facility there.{{sfn|Perry|2017}}

Aside from Bushehr's strategic significance—being situated 300&nbsp;km from [[Shiraz]] and 600&nbsp;km from that of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-ruled [[Basra]]—the place offered few benefits and numerous drawbacks. The town and its surrounding area were somewhat shielded by the interior's hilly terrain and narrow gorges, but were still vulnerable to pirate intrusion. In the 19th century, European ships had to dock around four kilometers offshore and transfer freight and passengers through small boats due to the shallow path to both the shoreline and the bay. Despite the numerous [[windcatcher]]s on top of the houses, the water in the wells was salty, and the summer heat and humidity were unbearable.{{sfn|Perry|2017}}

===The main commercial port of Iran===
Bushehr soon replaced [[Bandar Abbas]] as the country's most important commercial port. This was because of Iran's political and economic centre being moved to Shiraz under the [[Zand dynasty|Zand]] ruler [[Karim Khan Zand]] ({{reign|1751|1779}}), who had established his authority in western Iran.{{sfn|Perry|2017}}{{sfn|de Planhol|1990}}

== Climate ==
Bushehr has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''BSh'') with a precipitation pattern resembling a [[Mediterranean climate]], albeit it is both too hot and dry for too long to qualify as such, by a wide margin, due to the threshold for hot climates being much higher in terms of required rainfall.

==Nuclear development==
{{main|Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant}}

Bushehr is twelve kilometres from the site of the [[Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant]] being built in cooperation with [[Russia]].  The work was begun by the [[Bonn]] firm {{ill|Kraftwerk Union|de}} A.G., a unit of [[Siemens AG]], which contracted to build two nuclear reactors based on a contract worth $4 to $6 billion, signed in 1975.

Work stopped in January 1979, and Kraftwerk Union fully withdrew from the project in July 1979, with one reactor 50% complete, and the other reactor 85% complete. They said they based their action on Iran's non-payment of $450 million in overdue payments.  The company had received $2.5 billion of the total contract. Their cancellation came following the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]]. Iran subsequently requested that Siemens finish construction, but Siemens declined.  Shortly afterward [[Iraq]] invaded Iran and the nuclear programme was stopped until the end of the war. The reactors were damaged by multiple Iraqi airstrikes between March 1984 and 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/bushehr-intro.htm|title=Bushehr - Iran Nuclear Reactor|first=John|last=Pike|website=www.globalsecurity.org}}</ref>

In 1995, Russia signed a contract to supply a [[light water reactor]] for the plant (the contract is believed to be valued between $700 [[million]] and $1.2 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] USD). The agreement calls for the spent [[fuel rod]]s to be sent back to Russia for reprocessing. The plant started adding electricity to the national grid on 3 September 2011,<ref name=guardian-20110904>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/04/iran-nuclear-power-bushehr-plant |title=Iranian nuclear power station 'begins generating electricity' |agency=Reuters |work=The Guardian |date=4 September 2011 |access-date=4 September 2011 |location=London}}</ref> and was officially opened in a ceremony on 12 September 2011.{{cn|date=March 2023}}
