'''Aktau''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑː|k|ˈ|t|aʊ}}; {{lang-kk|Aqtau / Ақтау}} {{IPA|kk|ɑqˈtɑw|}} {{Pronunciation|Kk-aktau.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}) is a city in south-west [[Kazakhstan]], located on the eastern shore of the [[Caspian Sea]]. Its  name means 'white mountain' in the [[Kazakh language]], which may be due to its cliffs that overlook the Caspian. From 1964 to 1991, the city was known as '''Shevchenko''', which was given due to the [[Taras Shevchenko|eponymous Ukrainian poet's]] period of exile in the area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aboutkazakhstan.com/aktau-city |publisher=About Kazakhstan |access-date=2015-12-29 |title=Aktau city, Kazakhstan facts, history, attractions, photos}}</ref> It is located on the [[Mangyshlak Peninsula]] and is the capital of the [[Mangystau Region]].

Aktau is known for its unique [[city block|block]] [[house numbering|address system]]. Almost no streets in Aktau have names; instead, addresses generally consist of three numbers: the district number (also known as micro-region/micro-district/block), the building number, and the apartment number. This is because Aktau was originally planned as a camp for the workers of the oil industry.<ref name="Aktau: Years, people, memories">{{cite web |url=http://ogni.kz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5063&Itemid=2 |title=Aktau: Years, people, memories |date=October 13, 2011 |publisher=Ogni |access-date=July 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618230250/http://ogni.kz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5063&Itemid=2 |archive-date=June 18, 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>{{not in citation|date=September 2024}}

==History==
The territory of what is now Aktau was once inhabited by ancient tribes of [[Scythians]]. Archeological finds in the area include old settlements and utensils. The current territory of [[Mangystau Region]] hosted a spur route of the northern silk road, which resulted in the founding of several Sufi shrines in Aktau's vicinity. However, the area had very little population prior to Soviet times and no cities of any relevancy, almost certainly due to the scarcity of fresh water.

=== Soviet period ===
In 1958, [[uranium]] prospectors settled the site of modern Aktau, naming the settlement '''Melovoye''' after the bay on which it stood.<ref name="Pioneers">{{cite web |url=http://www.np.kz/old/2003/08/issled5.html|script-title=ru:Пионеры Запада |language=ru |publisher=Np.kz |date=February 28, 2003 |access-date=January 23, 2015 |archive-date=March 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324153840/http://www.np.kz/old/2003/08/issled5.html |url-status=dead}}</ref> After the development of the uranium deposits was started, the settlement was [[closed city|closed]] and renamed '''Guryev-20'''.<ref name="Pioneers" /> In 1963, its closed status was lifted, town status was granted,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} and the name was changed to Aktau.<ref name="Pospelov">Pospelov, p.&nbsp;25</ref> However, in 1964 it was given yet another name, '''Shevchenko''', to honor the Ukrainian poet [[Taras Shevchenko]] who spent 1850–1857 in political exile in [[Fort-Shevchenko|Novopetrovskoye]], about {{cvt|100|km|sp=us}} to the northwest.<ref name="Pospelov" /> This Ukrainian name for the city may have been granted due to the large number of Ukrainian workers who settled in the city. Their descendants are often easily identifiable to this day with many having surnames ending in '-enko'.

=== Post-independence period ===
After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and Kazakhstan gaining independence, the name Aktau was restored in 1991, but the city's airport still retains SCO as its IATA code.<ref name="Pospelov" />

==== Aktau city project ====
[[File:Horses in Mangystau Province, Kazakhstan.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the city]]

On September 11, 2007, President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] started the ''Aktau city'' project in order to develop tourism and attract investment.<ref name="Aktau City project">{{cite web |title=Ambitious Aktau-City project scrapped |url=https://m.azh.kz/en/news/view/1760 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801182245/https://m.azh.kz/en/news/view/1760 |archive-date=August 1, 2020 |access-date=14 November 2018 |website=Ақ Жайық |language=ru-RU}}</ref> A totally new city was to have been built to the north-west of the current city with 4 million square meters of new residential and business buildings. The architecture style would have been derived from [[UAE]]'s construction experience under the patronage of [[Sheikh Abdullah ibn Zaid Al Nahayan]]. In August 2013, the project was called off.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lada.KZ |title=Айдарбаев: Актау-сити не будет |url=http://www.lada.kz/aktau_news/society/10772-aydarbaev-aktau-siti-ne-budet.html |access-date=April 19, 2018 |website=lada.kz}}</ref>

==== 2017 time capsule opening ====
In 1967, the people of Aktau erected a [[time capsule]] to send a message to future generations of the [[Mangyshlak Peninsula]], including names of people who helped to build the town in the desert. The letter was put in a metallic cylinder in a triangular marble urn. It was opened in November 2017.<ref name="Aktau: Years, people, memories" /> The capsule is located in District 2, opposite the 'Kazakhstan Trade Center.'

A ceremony to open the capsule was arranged and people traveled from far and wide to attend. This was subsequently postponed and then cancelled when it became known that capsule was, in fact, missing. Previously the capsule had been buried in another part of the town but building works in that location caused it to be relocated to the District 2 location. The capsule did not make the move. An official from the time of the creation of the capsule who had been involved in the drafting of a message to be included within the capsule was able to remember word for word the message that was written which by all accounts contained a theme of hope for the future.

The text is now shown in Mangystau regional museum.

=== Industry ===
Major industry of the city remains hydrocarbon production as one of the biggest producing regions of the country. 
In addition to its strategic location as the main seaport, Aktau attracted the biggest players of the oil service industry:

*[[Arcelor Mittal]] pipelines manufacturing

==== Former nuclear power plant ====
Aktau was once the site of a nuclear power station. The [[BN-350 reactor|BN-350]] [[Fast-neutron reactor|fast reactor]] went online in 1973, and was shut down in 1999. The long-term plans of the Government of Kazakhstan include the construction of a new nuclear power station to be built near the site. In addition to producing [[plutonium]], BN-350 was used to provide power and for [[desalination]] to supply fresh water to the city. The current station is not considered powerful enough to supply the fresh water and energy needed at this time, and blackouts are a common occurrence.<ref name="Securing the Bomb">{{cite web |date=8 March 2008 |title=Securing the Bomb: Securing Nuclear Warheads and Materials: BN-350 Spent Fuel Security |url=http://www.nti.org/e_research/cnwm/securing/bn.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308052441/http://www.nti.org/e_research/cnwm/securing/bn.asp |archive-date=8 March 2008 |access-date=14 November 2018}}</ref>
