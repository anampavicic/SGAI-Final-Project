==Geography==
The name Dörtyol means "crossroads" (literally "four roads") in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and the town indeed sits on a crossing of highways, especially the O-53 from [[Anatolia]] south into [[Hatay Province|Hatay]] and on to [[Syria]]. The road is channelled along the narrow coastal strip with the [[Nur Mountains]] (the ancient [[Amanos]]) behind. Dörtyol is at the edge of the [[Çukurova|Çukurova Plain]] and being near the coast, it is humid, and the countryside is fairly green and fertile. Therefore, alongside oil handling, the economic activities of the district include [[forestry]], [[cotton]], and the cultivation of [[citrus fruit]]s, especially a local variety of [[tangerine|tangerines]].

===Climate===
Dörtyol has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa''),<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Table 1 Overview of the Köppen-Geiger climate classes including the defining criteria. |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02549-6/tables/1 |journal=Nature: Scientific Data |language=en}}</ref> with very hot, humid, and somewhat dry summers, and mild, wet winters.

==History==
This crossroads has seen the passage of numerous armies and some of the biggest military campaigns in history, including the [[Battle of Issus]] between [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Darius III|Darius]] in 333 BC.

Approximately 8000 [[Armenians]] lived in Dörtyol in 1908 and 12300 on the eve of the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Հայաստանի եւ հարակից շրջանների տեղանունների բառարան, Թ.Խ.

In 1909, during the [[Adana Massacre]], the Armenians of Dörtyol  resisted the massacres again, but many of them were killed. From 1919 to 1921, the Armenians again resisted the [[Armenian genocide]], but were almost completely exterminated. After the end of [[World War I]] the French and the Turks agreed on the Syrian-Turkish border following the [[Franco-Turkish War]], thus Dörtyol fell on the Turkish side, and the surviving Armenians fled to [[Iskenderun|Alexandretta]], [[Aleppo]], and [[Amman]].

Dörtyol is remembered in [[Turkey]] as the scene of the first fighting in the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. The fighting with the French occupying forces was ignited in [https://web.archive.org/web/20071009061637/http://www.karakese.bel.tr/karakese.asp Karakese], which is located on the edge of the mountainous village of Nur. In 1918, Dörtyol was occupied by French troops. Turks in the area retreated to the hills and began their resistance under the leadership of [[Abaza Hasan Pasha|Kara Hasan Pasha]]. Thus, Dörtyol ultimately never became part of the [[Republic of Hatay]], but instead functioned as a Turkish district added to Hatay when the province was brought into the [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]] in 1939.

Dörtyol was heavily damaged by [[2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake|powerful earthquakes]] in February 2023 and subsequent aftershocks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iskenderun.org/hatayda-agir-yikimin-bilancosu|title=Hatay’da ağır yıkımın bilançosu...|trans-title=The result of the heavy destruction in Hatay...|publisher=Iskenderun.org|date=2023-04-08|language=tr}}</ref>
