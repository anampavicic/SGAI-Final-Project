==History==
The city of Chinandega has been nicknamed "the City of Oranges" (''Ciudad de las Naranjas'') and "the Hot City" (''Ciudad Cálida''). Its name is of [[Nahuatl]] origin; although its exact meaning is disputed, it may come from the words ''Chinamitl-tacalt'', "place surrounded by reeds."<ref name="manfut.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.manfut.org/chinandega/chinandega.html |title=Museo Chorotega Chinandega Nicaragua manfut |publisher=[[YouTube]] }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitcentroamerica.com/visitar/chinandega/|title= Chinandega}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://secretcentralamerica.com/trip-ideas/experience/chinandega/|title= Chinandega}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://embajadadenicaragua.org/pages/organizacion-territorial-de-nicaragua/departamentos-de-nicaragua/chinandega.php|title= Chinandega}}</ref>

Chinandega was a small city during the [[Spanish Empire|colonial era]], but its location among fertile flatlands and its position as a commercial center led to its eventual rise in importance. The Spanish chronicler Friar [[Antonio Vázquez Espinoza]] in his compendium and description of the [[West Indies]] described his 1613 visit to Chinandega:<ref name="manfut.org"/>

{{Quote|text="The town of Chinandega is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} many Indians, plentiful corn, and all of the fruits of the earth, and appears to be a piece of paradise."|sign=|source=}}

Officially a settlement (''poblado'') from 1796, the city was planned by engineer Antonio Rojas. On March 30, 1835, a law was instituted that established a fair on December 8 of every year.

On March 15, 1836, during the government of [[José Núñez (President of Nicaragua)|José Núñez]], it received the title of town (''villa''), and on September 2, 1839, it received the title of city.

On November 1, 1998, Chinandega was hit by massive flooding caused by [[Hurricane Mitch]]. The flooding resulted in many thousands of people losing their homes, as well as damages to infrastructure which had not been repaired as of 2009.

==Churches==

===Our Lady Santa Ana Parish===
In accordance with its colonial past and colonial-era urban planning, the city is centered around a central park with the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque]]-style Our Lady Santa Ana Colonial Church. It has withstood over a century of violent storms, earthquakes, and wars. The church was severely affected by an earthquake in 1885, and was later rebuilt into its current state. This is not the location of the original building in the seventeenth century, however. According to documents from Bishop Morel of Santa Cruz dated June 1751, "This church owns three naves on the river, with its sacristy and choir close by, two small bells, limestone walls, and tiled floors". Two ancient doors in Antigueño style open on the north and south flanks of the church; these survived the earthquakes, including the 1925 earthquake that damaged the façade and towers.
[[Image:Altar mayor de Parroquia Santa Ana.JPG|thumb|left|240px|Our Lady Santa Ana Colonial Church]]
The [[feast day]] of [[Saint Anne]] is celebrated on July 26 of every year.

The church has been restored to its former colonial splendor, and awaits the announcement that will make it the seat of a new diocese, with the church itself becoming elevated to the status of cathedral.

===El Calvario Parish===
El Calvario ("[[Calvary]]") Parish is located in the neighborhood of the same name, and was built in 1874 by Bishop Monsignor [[Manuel Ulloa y Calvo]]. The first structure here was of adobe, but on October 11, 1885, this was destroyed by an earthquake and later rebuilt. Its patron is the [[Holy Name of Jesus]], celebrated on the last Sunday of January every year. On May 17, the feast day of [[Saint Pascal Baylon]] is also celebrated in the parish. The church was recently restored by the COEN Foundation.

===Sanctuary of Our Lady of Guadalupe===
Of recent construction, its origins lie in a structure built in 1855 but destroyed in an earthquake in 1885. It was originally built as an offering to [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] during an outbreak of [[cholera]].  After the outbreak, an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe was first displayed in the church on December 25, 1856, and [[Pope Pius IX]] elevated the church to the rank of sanctuary, the first church in [[Central America]] to earn this title. It was restored by the COEN Foundation and its principal feast day is celebrated on December 12, with processions during [[Holy Week]] being celebrated here as well.

===Saint Anthony Church (Iglesia San Antonio)===
This church also suffered from severe damage during the 1885 earthquake, after which it was enlarged. The church was unofficially associated with the city's aristocracy; elaborate weddings between members of the aristocracy were celebrated within its walls. In 1923, with the arrival of the [[Franciscans]] at the church, it was completely rebuilt. Its principal feast day falls on June 13 every year. There is also a procession that is held on January 1 of every year.

==Colonial buildings==
Chinandega has many colonial-era buildings, though not to the extent of the Nicaraguan cities of [[León, Nicaragua|León]] and [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]], since many of them were damaged during a 1928 [[bombardment]] by the Liberal forces, who had revolted against Conservative [[Adolfo Díaz]]. Most of the city was destroyed, and only the churches remained unharmed. The city does not have a code that protects colonial architecture as León and Granada do.

==Culture==
[[Image:Piezas Arqueologicas.JPG|thumb|240px|Artifacts in the Museo Municipal de Chinandega]]
Chinandega's cultural and historical riches date from before the Spanish conquest, when this region was inhabited by various [[Mesoamerican]] peoples, who had perhaps originated from the north, possibly from present-day [[Mexico]].  There is a museum in the city, "Enrique Mantica Deshon", which contains 1,200 [[archaeological]] artifacts of [[Pre-Columbian]] origin. There is also a municipal theater called "Rodrigo Callejas" which can seat 400 people.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

==Sports==
Chinandega is home to two [[association football|football]] clubs who have both played in the country's top tier in recent years: [[Chinandega FC]] and [[VCP Chinandega]]. They share the Estadio Efraín Tijerino Mazariego in the northwest of town near the [[Chinandega Airport|airport]]. [[Tigres de Chinandega]] also call the city home as a member of the [[Nicaragua Professional Baseball League]]. Several [[Major League Baseball]] players have been a member of Los Tigres, including [[Mark Minicozzi]].
