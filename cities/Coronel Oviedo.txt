'''Coronel Oviedo''' ({{IPA|es|koɾoˈnel oˈβjeðo}}), locally simply known as '''Oviedo''', is a city in east-central [[Paraguay]]. It is the capital of the [[Caaguazú Department]], about 150 kilometers east of [[Asunción]], and was founded in 1758.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/138335/Coronel-Oviedo|title=Coronel Oviedo &#124; Paraguay}}</ref>

The city has a population of about 52,400 (2006 Estimate) and is the hometown of former president [[Nicanor Duarte Frutos]].  Coronel Oviedo is an important transit point, as it lies halfway between Asunción and [[Ciudad del Este]].  In addition, it sits at the intersection of highways [[Ruta 2 (Paraguay)|Ruta 2]], [[Route 7 (Paraguay)|Ruta 7]] and [[Route 8 (Paraguay)|Ruta 8]].

The moniker for the city is the "Capital of Work" or ''capital de trabajo'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

The original name of the city at the time of its founding was "Nuestra Señora del Rosario de Ajos" or "Our Lady of the Rosary of Garlic", as the cultivation of [[garlic]] was a prominent local cash crop and formed a significant base for trade in the city. In 1931 the government of Paraguay changed the name of the city to Coronel Oviedo in memory of Cnel Florentin Oviedo, hero of the [[War of the Triple Alliance]].<ref>Decreto Num. 39296 del 5 de Febrero, firmado por el presidente José P. Guggiari y convertido en Ley de la Nación por Ley 1219 del 12 de Agosto de 1931</ref> After the war Oviedo settled in Ajos live there until his dead in 1935. 

The city is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Coronel Oviedo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/coro3.htm|title=Diocese of Coronel Oviedo, Paraguay}}</ref>
