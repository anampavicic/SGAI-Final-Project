'''Corrientes''' ({{IPA|es|koˈrjentes|-|ES-pe - Corrientes.ogg}}; [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]]: Taragui, literally: "Currents") is the capital city of the [[Provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]], [[Argentina]], located on the eastern shore of the [[Paraná River]], about {{convert|1000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from [[Buenos Aires]] and {{convert|300|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from [[Posadas, Misiones|Posadas]], on [[National Route 12 (Argentina)|National Route 12]]. It has a population of 346,334 according to the [[INDEC|2010 Census]]. It lies opposite its twin city, [[Resistencia, Chaco|Resistencia]], [[Chaco Province|Chaco]].

Corrientes has a mix of colonial and modern architecture, several churches and a number of [[lapacho]], [[Erythrina crista-galli|ceibo]], [[jacaranda]] and orange trees. It is also home to one of the biggest [[carnival]] and [[chamamé]] celebrations in the country.

The annual average temperature is {{convert|21.3|°C|°F}}. The annual rainfall is around {{convert|1500|mm|in}}.

== Transportation ==

[[File:BelgranoBridge Corrientes Argentina.jpg|thumb|center|Belgrano Bridge during sunset, Corrientes, Argentina.]]
Located in the [[Argentine Littoral]], near the [[Argentina–Paraguay border]], the [[General Belgrano Bridge]] crosses the [[Paraná River]] which serves as the natural border with the neighbouring [[Chaco Province]]. On the other side of the bridge is [[Resistencia, Chaco|Resistencia]], capital of Chaco. To the west and up the Paraná, between [[Paraguay]] and Argentina, lies the [[Yaciretá dam]], one of the largest [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power generators in the world.

The [[Doctor Fernando Piragine Niveyro International Airport]] {{Airport codes|CNQ|SARC}} at coordinates {{coord|27|26|20|S|58|46|03|W|}}, {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} away from the city, serves the city.

The [[Ferrocarril Económico Correntino]] narrow gauge railway line to [[Mburucuyá, Corrientes|Mburucuyá]] operated from 1912 until 1927.

[[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]] established in 1527 the ''Sancti Spiritu'' fort upstream of the [[Paraná River]], and in 1536 [[Pedro de Mendoza]] reached further north into the basin of the river, searching for the ''Sierras of Silver''.

'''Juan Torres de Vera y Aragón''' founded the city on April 3, 1588, and named it as ''San Juan de Vera de las Siete Corrientes'' ("Saint John of Vera of the Seven Currents"), which was later shortened to ''Corrientes''. The "seven currents" refer to the seven [[peninsula]]s on the shore of the river at this place, that produced wild currents that made difficult the navigation of the river through this part.

Nevertheless, its position between [[Asunción]] - in present [[Paraguay]] - and [[Buenos Aires]] made it an important middle point, especially because of its 55-metre-high lands that prevent flooding when the water level rises.

In 1615 [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] settled near the [[Uruguay River]]. In 1807 the city resisted the [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata|British invasions]]. During the [[Argentine War of Independence]] it was in permanent conflict with the centralist government of [[Buenos Aires]], but the [[Paraguayan War]] united them after the city was attacked by [[Paraguay]]an forces in 1865.
