==Overview==
Nagano City, located in the former [[Shinano Province]], developed in the [[Nara period]] (AD 710 to 794) as a temple town (''monzen machi''). The city of Nagano is home to [[Zenkō-ji]], a 7th-century [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple that is listed as a [[National Treasure (Japan)|Japanese National Treasure]]. Zenkō-ji was established at its current location in 642 AD. The location of Zenkō-ji is approximately two kilometers from the present-day central [[Nagano Station]]. Between 1553 and 1564, during the [[Sengoku Period]], the Age of Warring States, Nagano was the site of a series of conflicts known as the Battles of Kawanakajima. During the [[Edo period]] (1603 and 1868), as the city developed, Nagano became an important [[Shukuba|post station (shukuba)]] on the [[Hokkoku Kaidō|Hokkoku Kaidō highway]] which connected [[Edo]] (present day Tokyo) with coast of the [[Sea of Japan]]. Following the [[Meiji restoration]], Nagano became the first established modern town in Nagano prefecture, on April 1, 1897.

The city of Nagano and several surrounding communities hosted the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] and the [[1998 Winter Paralympics]]. Nagano City is an important historical location and an industrial center, as well as a travel destination and a hub for accessing surrounding sightseeing spots, including Japan's ''[[onsen]]''-bathing, the [[Japanese macaque|snow monkeys]] in [[Yamanouchi, Nagano|Yamanouchi]], and the world-class ski resorts of [[Hakuba, Nagano|Hakuba]], [[Shiga Highlands|Shiga Kogen]] and [[Nozawaonsen, Nagano|Nozawaonsen]].

===1998 Winter Olympics and Paralympics===
{{main|1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Winter Paralympics}}

Nagano, along with the neighboring communities of [[Hakuba, Nagano|Hakuba]] village, [[Nozawaonsen, Nagano|Nozawaonsen]], [[Yamanouchi, Nagano|Yamanouchi]], [[Iizuna, Nagano|Iizuna]], and [[Karuizawa]] hosted the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] from February 7 to February 22 and the [[1998 Winter Paralympics|Paralympics]] from March 5 to March 14. This was the third [[Olympic Games]] and second [[Winter Olympic Games]] to be held in Japan, after the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]], and the [[1972 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sapporo]] (the first Winter Games ever held in Asia). As of 2019, Nagano was the southernmost host of the Winter Olympic Games. The [[Nagano Olympic Commemorative Marathon]] is held annually to commemorate the occasion.

One important legacy of the Games was an improved transportation network. In order to facilitate access to Nagano in advance of the Games, the city was linked to the high-speed ''[[shinkansen]]'' train network. The Nagano Shinkansen (now the [[Hokuriku Shinkansen]]) was inaugurated five months before the start of the Games and carried 655,000 passengers during the Winter Olympics.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hanazawa |first1=Nahomi |title=Official Report of the 1998 Winter Olympic Games, Vol. 2: Sixteen Days of Glory |date=1999 |publisher=NAOC |location=Nagano |isbn=4784098267 |page=309 |url=https://library.olympic.org/Default/doc/SYRACUSE/66018/the-xviii-olympic-winter-games-official-report-nagano-1998-the-organizing-committee-for-the-xviii-ol?_lg=en-GB#_ga=2.180058080.593715491.1556337607-881899984.1556337607 |access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref> In addition, both [[Nagano Station]] and [[Shinonoi Station]] were expanded, and [[Imai Station]], in the Kawanakajima area, was built to give access the Athletes village.

==Geography==
Nagano is located in north-central Nagano Prefecture, in the Nagano Basin (''Zenkoji Daira''), surrounding by mountains, near the [[confluence]] of the [[Chikuma River]] and the Sai River. The Sai River in Nagano should not be confused with the [[Sai River (Gifu)]] even though both rivers have the same ''[[kanji]]'' and reading, 犀川 (Saigawa). Other important rivers include the Susobana River, which originates in the Togakushi highland area, and the Torii River, which also originates in the Togakushi highlands. The Chikuma River is 367.0&nbsp;km long, 29.5&nbsp;km of which are within the Nagano city limits. The Sai River is 157.7&nbsp;km long, with 44.2&nbsp;km in Nagano. All 40.1&nbsp;km of the Susobana River are in Nagano City, and 10.4&nbsp;km of the 34.8&nbsp;km-long Torii River are in Nagano<ref>{{cite web |title=長野市統計書 |url=https://www.city.nagano.nagano.jp/site/kikaku-toukei/40502.html |website=Nagano City Official Website |publisher=Nagano City |access-date=10 May 2019}}</ref> [[Myōkō-Togakushi Renzan National Park]], [[Jōshin'etsu-kōgen National Park]] and [[Chūbu-Sangaku National Park]] are each partially located within Nagano City.

The present-day [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] of Nagano includes the districts and former towns of Nagano, Shinonoi, Matsushiro, Wakaho, Kawanakajima, Kohoku, Naniai, Shinkomachi, Toyono, Togakushi, Kinasa, Ooka, Shinshushincho, Nakajo.

===Climate===
Nagano has a [[hot-summer humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa'') that borders on a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''). Its location in a sheltered inland valley means it receives less precipitation than any part of Japan except [[Hokkaidō]]. The city receives heavy winter snow totaling {{convert|2.57|m|in|0}} from December to March, but it is less gloomy during these cold months than the coast from [[Hagi, Yamaguchi|Hagi]] to [[Wakkanai, Hokkaidō|Wakkanai]].

==History==
===Ancient ages===
Nagano is located in former [[Shinano Province]] and developed from the [[Nara period]] as a temple town at the gate of the famous [[Zenkō-ji]], a 7th-century [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple which was relocated to this location in 642 AD.

In the southern section of Nagano City are a series of over 500 [[kofun|burial mounds]] at [[Ōmuro Kofun group|Ōmuro Kofun]] - a [[Monuments of Japan|National historic site]] - dating from the 5th-8th centuries.

===Middle ages===
During the [[Sengoku period]] (c. 1467 – c. 1600), the area was hotly contested between the forces of the [[Uesugi clan]] based in [[Echigo Province]] and the [[Takeda clan]] based in [[Kai Province]]. The several [[Battles of Kawanakajima]] between [[Uesugi Kenshin]] and [[Takeda Shingen]] were fought near here.

===Early modern ages===
During the [[Edo period]] (1603 and 1868), much of the area came under the control of the [[Sanada clan]] based at [[Matsushiro Domain]]. 
The area suffered from flooding in 1742, and from a destructive earthquake in 1847.
[[shukuba|Post station]] on the [[Hokkoku Kaidō]] highway connecting [[Edo]] with the [[Sea of Japan]] coast.

===Late modern ages===
Following the [[Meiji restoration]] and the creation of the municipalities system on April 1, 1889, the modern town of Nagano was established. Nagano was elevated to city status on April 1, 1897.
During [[World War II]], construction of the [[Matsushiro Underground Imperial Headquarters]] as the last redoubt for the Japanese government following the projected [[Operation Downfall|American invasion of Japan]] was started in 1944, but was aborted in 1945 due to the end of war.

It was the first city founded in Nagano Prefecture and the 43rd city in Japan. Nagano hosted the [[1998 Winter Olympics]], [[1998 Winter Paralympics]], and the [[2005 Special Olympics World Winter Games]].

===Contemporary ages===
;Growth of the city
The city borders expanded on July 1, 1923, with the annexation of the neighbouring town of Yoshida and villages of Sarita, Miwa and Komaki.

The city again expanded on April 1, 1954, by annexing neighbouring villages of Asahi, Furusato, Yanagihara, Wakatsuki, Asakawa, Naganuma, Amori, Odagiri, Imoi and Mamejima. 
In 1959, due to the flooding of Chikuma River, 71 people died or were missing and 20,000 homes were flooded. 
On October 16, 1966, the city again expanded by annexing the neighbouring towns of Kawanakajima, [[Matsushiro, Nagano|Matsushiro]] and Wakaho, and villages of Shinonoi, Kohoku, Shinko, and Naniai. 
During the 1985 Matsushiro earthquake, 27 people died and 60 homes were destroyed or badly damaged due to landslides. In 1999, Nagano was designated as a {{Nihongo|[[Core cities of Japan|core city]]|中核市|Chūkakushi}}, a category of [[cities of Japan|Japanese city]]. 
Nagano continued to expand on January 1, 2005,  by absorbing the municipalities of [[Toyono, Nagano|Toyono]], and the village of [[Togakushi, Nagano|Togakushi]], and [[Kinasa, Nagano|Kinasa]] (from [[Kamiminochi District, Nagano|Kamiminochi District]]), and the village of [[Ōoka, Nagano|Ōoka]] (from [[Sarashina District, Nagano|Sarashina District]]).
