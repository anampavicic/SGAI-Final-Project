'''Linköping''' ({{IPA|sv|ˈlɪ̂nːˌɕøːpɪŋ|lang|sv-Linköping.ogg}}) is a city in southern Sweden, with around 167,000 inhabitants as of 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Befolkningsförändringarna i Linköpings kommun |url=https://www.linkoping.se/kommun-och-politik/fakta-om-linkoping/statistik/linkoping-i-siffror/befolkning/senaste-kvartalet/ |access-date=2024-08-20 |website=www.linkoping.se/ |language=sv}}</ref> It is the seat of [[Linköping Municipality]] and the capital of [[Östergötland County]]. Linköping is also the [[episcopal see]] of the [[Diocese of Linköping]] ([[Church of Sweden]]) and is well known for its cathedral. Linköping is the center of an old [[cultural region]] and celebrated its 700th anniversary in 1987. Dominating the city's skyline from afar is the steeple of [[Linköping Cathedral|the cathedral]] ({{lang|sv|Domkyrkan}}).

Nowadays, Linköping is known for its [[Linköping University|university]] and its [[High tech|high-technology]] industry. Linköping wants to create a sustainable development of the city and therefore plans to become a [[Carbon neutrality|carbon-neutral]] community by 2025. Located on the Östergötland Plain, Linköping is closely linked to [[Norrköping]], roughly {{convert|40|km|mi}} to the east, near the sea.

==History==
[[File:Lkpgdomkyrka-ne.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Linköping Cathedral]] seen from the east.]]
[[File:Suecia 3-004 ; Linköping.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Linköping seen from West, in the ''[[Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna]]''.]]
[[File:Hunnebergsgatan i Linköping.JPG|thumb|240px|right|Hunnebergsgatan: an old street with preserved older buildings.]]

The city is possibly named after the ''[[Lionga thing|Lionga ting]]'' assembly which according to [[Medieval Scandinavian laws]]  was the most important [[Thing (assembly)|thing]] in [[Östergötland]]. Exact location of the Lionga ting is not known, but it was along the [[Eriksgata]]. The term "[[Köping|-köping]]" means there was a market there.

Historically, Linköping is famed for being an early [[diocese]], {{circa}} 1082,<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Linköping |volume=16 |page=730}}</ref> second in Sweden (within its pre-1658 boundaries) only to [[Diocese of Skara|Skara]]. The diocese is first mentioned in 1104 in the so-called "[[List of Florence]]" (''Lionga. Kaupinga''). The monastery of [[Vreta Abbey|Vreta Kloster]] near Roxen north of Linköping was established in 1128, and the oldest parts of the cathedral are also from the 12th century (although it has been changed many times since then, the eye-catching tower with copper roofing being a 19th-century product). On several occasions attempts to achieve a separate Swedish archdiocese were based in Linköping, although, when they finally were successful in 1164, [[Uppsala]] was chosen instead.

The coronation of [[Valdemar, King of Sweden|Valdemar Birgersson]] took place in the cathedral in 1251.<ref name=EB1911/> In the reign of [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustavus Vasa]] several important [[Diet (assembly)|diets]] were held in the town.<ref name=EB1911/>

Religious centers tend to become educational centers, and Linköping was no exception. A [[cathedral school]] can be traced from 1266. In 1627 the current [[Katedralskolan, Linköping|Linköping cathedral school]] was established, making it the third oldest [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in Sweden.

Also, Linköping was the site for the final settlement of the dispute between king [[Sigismund III Vasa]] and his uncle [[Charles IX of Sweden|Duke Charles]], the latter prevailing in the [[battle of Stångebro]] (the main bridge in Linköping) on 25 September 1598. This ultimately led to the rise to the throne of Charles (''de facto'' at the 1600 [[Riksdag of the Estates]] meeting in Linköping and formally four years later) and the end of the short-lived [[Swedish-Polish personal union]], as well as the [[Linköping Bloodbath|execution]] of five of Charles's political opponents on the main square of Linköping on 20 March 1600.

Linköping was a small town until 1937, when the [[Saab Group|Saab]] aircraft industry was formed, starting a period of rapid expansion. [[Linköping University]] was established in the 1960s. Today the city is a center of high-technology and software industry.

== Climate ==
Linköping has a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfb''), though with maritime influences, retaining the large differences between seasons but being comparatively mild when measured against other areas of the world on similar latitudes. Linköping tends to be slightly cooler in summer than nearby areas in the Mälar valley, but still was the weather station in Sweden among the officially listed for monthly statistics, that until 2018 had come the closest to a subtropical month, with July 1914 having a mean temperature of {{convert|21.8|C|F}}, with the subtropical border being at {{convert|22|C|F}} for the warmest month.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smhi.se/pd/klimat/pdf_stats/month/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jul18.pdf|title=July 2018 Air Temperature & Wind (all-time stats)|language=sv|publisher=[[SMHI]]|accessdate=4 February 2023}}</ref> Normally summer highs average in the low 20s and winter temperatures commonly hover just above the freezing point during the day, then falls below it at night.

Linköping offers a wealth of leisure activities to people of all ages. Residents and visitors are able to enjoy art, theatre, history, concerts, markets, festivals and sporting events.

Special sights of interests are:  the locks of Berg on the [[Göta Canal]], the locks of the Kinda Canal, ''Gamla'' Linköping, Valla ''skogen'' and Valla ''fritidsområde'' (Old Linköping, [[Valla Wood]], and the Valla recreational area), ''Flygvapen'' museum (the Air Force Museum), Linköping's ''domkyrka'' (the cathedral), ''Slotts- och domkyrkomuseet'' (the Castle and Cathedral Museum) and ''Östergötlands Länsmuseum'' (the Östergötland County Museum).  ''Konsthallen Passagen'' is an art gallery located in the main square.

Tornby, to the north of the city centre, is a shopping area with retail outlets.

The city and its environs offer all sorts of green landscapes to see and experience.  Two examples are a park named after the group responsible for it, ''Trädgårdsföreningen'' (The Garden Society), and the Tinnerö area with its oak woodland.  Local bodies of water include the lakes Roxen, Rängen and Järnlunden, the River Stångån/Kinda Canal and the Göta Canal with the Berg locks. These areas can be accessed by foot, bicycle, or boat.

Linköping is the home of the Linköping Symphony Orchestra. The city is one of the sites of the ''Östergötland Music Days'' each summer, and the host of the ''Student Orchestra Festival'' in May every other year. One of the most notable choirs in Linköping is the [[Linköping University Male Voice Choir]].

Linköping is also the home of theatrical heavy metal band [[Ghost (Swedish band)|Ghost]] and rock band the Pusjkins ([[:sv:The Pusjkins|sv]]).

The area around the main square was re-planned in the 1960s, and many old houses were destroyed. Some, however, were moved to ''[[Gamla Linköping]]'' (Old Linköping), in the city's western part, neighbouring the university's main campus. It is a living museum environment and a popular site with both residents and tourists.

[[NärCon]], the largest anime and gaming convention in the [[Nordic countries]], is held in Linköping.

==Sport==
Teams from Linköping are prominent in [[floorball]], [[volleyball]] ([[Linköpings VC]]) and [[ice hockey]] ([[Linköpings HC]]; see above, or "Cluben" as some fans refer to it). The hockey team allied itself with Linköping's women's football team and created [[Linköpings FC]], which plays in the highest division. The team won the Swedish Cup in 2006 and 2014. The world's largest floorball club Linköping Innebandy resides in the indoor sports arena in the city centre. The city continues to lack a first-class men's team in football with several teams competing in the lower leagues.
