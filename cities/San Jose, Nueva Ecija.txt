'''San Jose''', officially the '''City of San Jose''' ({{langx|fil|Lungsod ng San Jose}}; {{langx|ilo|Siudad ti San Jose}}), is a 2nd class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Nueva Ecija]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 150,917 people.{{PH census|current}}

==Etymology==
The town got its name after [[Saint Joseph]], the patron saint of the place. <!--NOTE: The name San Jose was adopted on March 19, 1894, during that time, San Jose was not yet a city, hence, a town.-->

Before the city was founded by the Spanish colonizers, it is known as ''Kabaritan'', named for the plant commonly seen in the area.

==History==
San Jose, years before it became a town was a wilderness, a veritable hunting ground for wild animals by the inhabitants of its neighboring towns. The earliest inhabitants were known as [[Negritos]] (Baluga) headed by Kapitan Danding, a Negrito convert residing in Pinagcuartelan. These early inhabitants depended mostly on hunting and fishing for their livelihood. Some hunters from the neighboring towns considered San Jose to be a good place for settlers due to its wide and uncleared agricultural land. The first group of settlers made some clearings (kaingin) in the outskirts of the present town.<ref name="San Jose City">{{cite web|title=San Jose City|url=http://www.1stphilippines.com/pc-9eb02c3d2f515ed3243641eee5ed59df.html|publisher=1stPhilippines.com|access-date=May 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525113332/http://www.1stphilippines.com/pc-9eb02c3d2f515ed3243641eee5ed59df.html|archive-date=May 25, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Originally, San Jose was a part of the town of Puncan, but later on, because of its nearness to [[Lupao]], it was made a [[barrio]] of the latter. The early history of this town was coupled with the early history of Puncan and Lupao. Formerly, San Jose was known as the barrio of “Kabaritan” derived from ''barit'', an [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] word for a plant that belongs to the rattan family. “Kabaritan” means the place where “barit” grows in abundance.<ref name="San Jose City"/><ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite book |title=Central Luzon Yearbook |date=1974 |publisher=s.n. |page=206 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sk5XAAAAMAAJ |access-date=September 12, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

===Spanish colonial era===
On March 19, 1894, San Jose became a full-fledged town, with an [[interim government]] headed by a Capitan Municipal. “Kabaritan” (now known as San Jose) was made an independent town from [[Lupao]] and was named after [[Saint Joseph]], the patron saint of the place.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

During the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Regime]], the barrio of Kabaritan was a municipal district of Lupao, headed by a ''Teniente Absoluto''. Later, when Kabaritan was declared a town in 1894, the head was changed to a ''Capitan Municipal''. The first appointed Capitan Municipal was Canuto Ramos, who served from 1894 to 1898. One of his remarkable achievements was the construction of an irrigation system which was later taken over and enlarged by the government (now the Talavera River Irrigation System) which irrigates vast ricefields as far as the towns of Muñoz and [[Talavera, Nueva Ecija|Talavera]].

Several years before the [[Philippine Revolution]], the [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]]s from [[Ilocos]] Region and some parts of [[Nueva Ecija]], especially the towns of [[Santo Domingo, Nueva Ecija|Santo Domingo]], [[Muñoz, Nueva Ecija|Muñoz]] and [[Lupao]], as well as [[Pangasinan people|Pangasinenses]] of [[Pangasinan]] and northern [[Tarlac]], Tagalogs (including Batangueños) and Kapampangans, settled into the forest of Kabaritan, and cleared its wilderness.<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref>[https://tourismnuevaecija.weebly.com/uploads/5/2/4/1/52413881/history_of_nueva_ecija.doc History of Nueva Ecija]</ref> It was from this time then that the growth of the town really started.

=== American era ===
When the revolution broke out and upon the surrender of the Spaniards in 1898, a revolutionary government was set up in San Jose. The town remained as such until the establishment of a civil government under the Americans in 1901.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

San Jose, under the American Regime,<ref name="American Period">{{cite web|url=http://www.philippinecountry.com/philippine_history/american_period.html|title=Philippine History-American Period|publisher=philippinecountry.com}}</ref> became a progressive town. Its inhabitants enjoyed more rights and privileges- political, economic, intellectual and religious than before. This was due to the establishment of various schools, churches, public buildings and the construction of roads and bridges, which made possible the fast progress of the town.

From 1898 to 1900, a military government under the American Regime<ref name="American Period"/> was established. Jose Cardenas was appointed Capitan Municipal. During his term, the appointment of town officials, town planning, and the opening of new settlements were among his achievements.

The second appointed Capitan Municipal during the military government (1900–1901) was Celestino Javalde who continued the opening of new settlements and the construction of roads in the poblacion.

When the civil government under the American Regime was established, Cornelio Ramos was appointed Capitan Municipal. He continued the construction of roads in the ''[[poblacion]]'' and he also took a hand in the construction of irrigation canals leading to the different barrios of San Jose.

In 1904, the [[Filipinos]] were given more rights and freedom in choosing the right man to take the reins of the government. An election was held. The first elected Municipal President was Crisanto Sanchez (1904–1906). Among his achievements were the construction of roads, the naming of the streets in the poblacion and the appointments of municipal officials.

Again, (1906–1908) Celestino Javalde was elected Municipal President.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book |title=Central Luzon Yearbook |date=1974 |publisher=s.n. |page=207 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sk5XAAAAMAAJ |access-date=September 12, 2019 |language=en}}</ref> With the help of his vice-president and other municipal officials, he stressed land reforms, which paved the way for equal distribution of lands.

The President-elect of 1908–1910, Valerio Escobar concentrated on the construction of roads from Sibut to San Agustin. He also founded the barrios of Santa Barbara and Kapisungan (now Bagong Sikat).

Desiderio De Guzman was elected in 1910 and served up to 1912.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> He had many achievements but among all these, he paid more attention to the improvements of records in the Poblacion.

During the [[Incumbent|incumbency]] of Municipal President Agapito Kurameng, (1912–1916), he initiated the construction of a concrete elementary school building (Gabaldon building) which now comprised one of the central school buildings of the San Jose West Elementary School. The improvement of roads, and expropriation of lots for the Municipal Hall and the Public Market were among his other achievements.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

The construction of the Municipal building and the construction of more roads leading to the barrios were launched by Gregorio Cadhit (1916–1919). He was re-elected to office from 1919 to 1922. During his second term, he initiated the construction of one of the buildings of the public market.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

As years went by, the town developed such that there was a need for more public improvements and building constructions for the welfare of the populace. To meet these demands, the newly elected President Rafael Rueda and Vice-president Estanislao Arquero with the help of other municipal officials put up a Puericulture Center and a Municipal Nursery from 1922 to 1925. A second building for the public market was also constructed. Telephone lines connecting the poblacion with all the barrios were installed. A road to Kalbarito (now Palestina) was constructed and more improvement of roads was done.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

Raymundo Eugenio was elected Municipal President of San Jose for the period from 1925 to 1928. A third building for the public market was constructed and more construction of roads, especially those leading to Andres Bonifacio, were put underway.

In 1928–1931, Apolonio Pascual and Vice-president Victorino Villar were instrumental in putting up the fourth building for the public market and the municipal dispensary. More improvement of roads leading to the barrios was also done.

Raymundo Eugenio was re-elected to the office. He served from 1931 to 1934 with Vice-president Ladislao Bunag. Eugenio was called the road-building President of San Jose because of his efforts in the construction of many roads especially leading to the barrios of Bagong Bayan, Porais, Tondod, and Andres Bonifacio.

Apolonio Pascual was re-elected for the 1934–1937 term. Dimas Tomas was his vice president. Changes in the set-up in 1935 upon the establishment of the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] marked the transition of the heads of the municipal government to be known as the Alcalde and Vice-Alcalde. Aside from the construction of more roads, the barrios of Patacla (now San Francisco) and A. Pascual were founded. The waterworks that provide the people of San Jose with drinking water was constructed and installed. The home economics building of San Jose Central School was also constructed.

Alcalde Pedro Del Pilar and Vice-Alcalde Severino Bautista, under the Commonwealth government, established NARIC (National Rice and Corn) buying stations in the town. This was during their term of office from 1937 to 1940. They were re-elected for the 1940–1942 term. As a continuation of their policies, the improvement of roads was continued.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

===Japanese occupation===
Upon the outbreak of [[World War II]] on December 8, 1941, San Jose became an evacuation center for refugees from neighboring provinces especially those from Manila and its suburbs. The town was bombed by two Japanese planes on December 23, 1941. The terror-stricken populace, who suffered heavy casualties, fled to the remotest barrios of San Jose. An emergency government was established in the barrio of Porais with Basilio Duran as Mayor, appointed by the military forces of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth Government]]. The emergency government existed for a short time, due to the arrival of the [[Military history of Japan|Japanese Imperial Forces]] on January 26, 1942.

An emergency government, under the control of the Japanese Imperial Forces, was likewise established in Porais with Matias Bautista as Mayor. Due to the non-cooperation of Bautista, the Japanese army replaced him with Anastacio Bascos. Engr. Casimiro Panajon succeeded him, but was later murdered by the Japanese for his non-collaboration with them and his guerilla activities.

During the liberation, Anselmo Patacsil, Pedro Del Pilar and Basilio Duran were appointed in succession as Mayors  by the PCAU (Philippine Civil Affairs Unit).<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Each served for a short period in 1945–1946. They once more strived for the re-organization of the municipal government in cooperation with officials to coordinate the work of the PCAU. These persons helped in the establishment of emergency hospitals, the [[Constancio Padilla National High School|North Provincial High School]] and the re-opening of elementary schools.

===Philippine independence===
After Philippine independence in 1946, Alfonso Villamar was elected Mayor with Paulino Margarejo as his Vice Mayor, (1947–1951).<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Among their achievements were the maintenance of evacuees, pacification campaign, rehabilitation of devastated government building, the establishment of a fire department and a municipal library and the improvement of roads.

==== Creation of Llanera ====
In 1954, the barrios of Bagumbayan (townsite), Andres Bonifacio, Caridad, San Mauricio (portion), Parang Manga (portion), Santa Barbara, Floridablanca, Gomez, San Francisco, and Victoria were separated to form the town of [[Llanera, Nueva Ecija|Llanera]] along with some territory from [[Talavera, Nueva Ecija|Talavera]] and [[Rizal, Nueva Ecija|Rizal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1221-creating-the-municipality-of-llanera,-nueva-ecija.html|title=An Act to Create the Municipality of Llanera in the Province of Nueva Ecija|publisher=LawPH.com|access-date=April 11, 2011}}</ref>

===Religion===
[[File:San Jose Cathedral facade in San Jose, Nueva Ecija.jpg|thumb|[[San Jose Cathedral (Nueva Ecija)|Cathedral of Saint Joseph the Worker]]]]
On February 16, 1984, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Jose (Nueva Ecija)|Diocese of San Jose]] was created by [[Pope John Paul II]]. The creation of the new [[diocese]] bisected the province horizontally into the [[Diocese of Cabanatuan]] in the south, and the Diocese of San Jose in the north, both the [[suffragan]]s of the [[Archdiocese of Lingayen-Dagupan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbcponline.net/jurisdictions/sj_necija.html|title=Diocese of San Jose, Nueva Ecija|publisher=Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines|access-date=June 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516161043/http://www.cbcponline.net/jurisdictions/sj_necija.html|archive-date=May 16, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> 80% of the city residents are [[Catholic]]s and the patron saint is [[Saint Joseph]]. The feast is celebrated every March 19 annually. The diocese now has 17 [[parish]]es administered by 22 priests working under one [[bishop]]. Among its Catholic institutions are 9 high schools, 4 elementary schools, 6 kindergarten schools, 1 diocesan [[Catholic catechesis|catechetical center]], and the Don Bosco Training Center. {{clear left}}

== Economy ==
{{stack|float=left|{{PH poverty incidence}}}}
Agriculture is the prime revenue of San Jose City since it is a part of the rice granary of the Philippines. However other agri-based produce are vegetables, fruits and onions. The city is now a leading producer of onions in the country.<ref name="sanjosecity-ne">{{cite web|url=http://www.sanjosecity-ne.gov.ph/about.php|title=San Jose City at a Glance|publisher=sanjosecity-ne.gov.ph|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609024925/http://www.sanjosecity-ne.gov.ph/about.php|archive-date=June 9, 2012}}</ref>

The city's local crops range from rice, corn, and onion; thus the city is also referred to as the "City of the Golden Harvests" and “Rice Bowl of the Philippines.” Other crops are mango, banana, eggplant, and garlic.<ref name="sanjosecity-ne" />

=== Industries ===
San Jose City is home to various renewable energy firms including the 24-megawatt San Jose City iPower Corporation. Considered the first of its kind in the country, the San Jose biomass project is using 100% rice husk. The biomass facility was put up by 21 rice millers of the city in a joint venture with the Union Energy Corp. owned by businessman Lucio Co, to set up a P1.2-billion rice husk-powered system that is now generating 12 megawatts of electricity, 10.8 MW of which feed the Luzon grid. Another 12 MW expansion was commissioned in 2017.

In 2017, the Board of Investments (BOI) has approved the P777-million biomass power plant project of VS Gripal Power Corp. which involved the development, construction and operation of another 6 MW biomass power plant. Similarly, the plant generates power using rice husk as feedstock. Commercial operations started in December 2019.

Meanwhile, several other solar energy projects was put up in the city including the 10 MW SJC SolarPower Corporation project and another 10 MW solar power project by V-Mars Solar Energy Corporation which was recently acquired by Yuchengco group's PetroGreen Energy Corp.

=== Shopping centers ===
San Jose City serves as another shopping hub, besides Cabanatuan, in the province and other nearby localities and provinces like Pangasinan and Nueva Viscaya. Malls like Waltermart and Magic Mall have already established their presence in the city.

In terms of future developments, the Philippines' major mall chains [[SM Supermalls|SM]], [[Robinsons Malls|Robinsons]], and [[CityMall (Philippines)|CityMall]] all have expressed plans to build branches in the city. <ref>{{Cite web |last=SM Prime |title=SM PRIME HOLDINGS, INC. : OFFER SUPPLEMENT |url=https://www.smprime.com/sites/default/files/investor_relations/Offer%20Supplement.pdf |url-status=dead |website=SM Prime |access-date=June 24, 2022 |archive-date=January 30, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220130121244/https://www.smprime.com/sites/default/files/investor_relations/Offer%20Supplement.pdf }}</ref>

===Festivals===
[[File:Tanduyong Festival San Jose City Nueva Ecijajf.jpg|thumb|[[Tanduyong Festival]] in 2013]]

* [[Tanduyong Festival]]: San Jose City prides itself as the "Onion Capital of the Philippines" and is a leading producer of onion, garlic, rice and vegetables. Tanduyong is a variety of onion grown in the area. Every year, on the fourth Sunday of April, the people of San Jose celebrate the Tanduyong Festival.<ref name="sanjosecity-ne" /> On festival day, the streets are filled with contingents of dancers outfitted in striking, multi-hued native costumes. Special activities included are a beauty contest, tourism, and trade fair, awarding ceremony and cultural shows.
* [[Pagibang Damara]]: Hundreds of years ago in [[Central Luzon]], landlords in the haciendas made the farmers build the “''damara''”, just before planting time of palay. A “''damara''” is a makeshift shelter made from kawayan (bamboo) and nipa, built at the center of ricefields as a protection from the sun's heat or from rain. Over the years, it has been a tradition that after all the harvests were safely brought home, the “damaras” are demolished (“ginigiba”). People then start celebrating together for the bountiful harvest.

In 2008, with rice as its primary produce, San Jose City conducted its First Rice Festival, adopting the century – old festive tradition. However, unlike in older days, wherein people celebrate separately in their barangays, San Jose City now celebrates together. The after-harvest celebration has become a multi-sectoral effort, collectively prepared, funded out of contributions (from the public and private sector), and participated in by all sections of the city.

Since 2015, Pagibang Damara festival features the best Pancit Kanin contest. Pansit Kanin is one of the most common menus among carinderias in San Jose City.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/video/lifestyle/05/03/15/recipe-nueva-ecijas-pancit-kanin|title=Recipe: Nueva Ecija's Pancit-Kanin|work=ABS-CBN News|access-date=June 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609185448/http://news.abs-cbn.com/video/lifestyle/05/03/15/recipe-nueva-ecijas-pancit-kanin/|archive-date=June 9, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Former PNR Station in San Jose ===
[[File:Old PNR Station in San Jose City, Nueva Ecija 01.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the old PNR station in San Jose City]]
The [[Philippine National Railways]] (then Manila Railroad Company) used to have a branch line northwards from [[Tutuban station]] in [[Manila]] and branches out from the mainline in [[Tarlac City]] going to San Jose City. The Tarlac-San Jose line, which served the towns of [[Guimba]], [[Muñoz, Nueva Ecija|Muñoz]] and San Jose, was initially constructed in the 1920's and was completed in 1939. However, in 1988, the North Main Line was closed (see [[Philippine National Railways]]) and subsequently dismantled. The concrete ruins of the old MRR station of San Jose are located along San Roque Street in Barangay Abar 1st.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Colonial Iron Horse: Railroads and Regional Development in the Philippines, 1875-1935|last = Corpuz|first = Arturo G.|publisher = University of the Philippines Press|year = 1999|isbn = 9789715422208|location = Quezon City}}</ref>

=== Expressways and Bypass Roads ===
San Jose City shall also be serviced by a future expressway, which is the partially completed [[Central Luzon Link Expressway]] ([[Subic–Clark–Tarlac Expressway|SCTEX]]-[[Tarlac–Pangasinan–La Union Expressway|TPLEX]] to San Jose City), when finished. The expressway will shorten the usual travel time between the neighboring provinces and San Jose City also stimulating the economy of the towns that the carriageway will pass through as a direct consequence.<ref>{{Cite web |last=News |first=TED CORDERO, GMA |title=DPWH: Central Luzon Link Expressway now 96% complete |url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/regions/839081/dpwh-central-luzon-link-expressway-now-96-complete/story/ |access-date=July 24, 2022 |website=GMA News Online |language=en}}</ref> 

To decongest the Pan-Philippine Highway, San Jose City Bypass Road was constructed. It passes through barangays Caanawan, Abar 2nd, Sto. Niño 1st and 2nd, Malasin, Manicla and Kita-kita; and ends at San Jose-Lupao Road, serving as an easier access going to [[Tarlac]] and [[Umingan]], [[Pangasinan]].
