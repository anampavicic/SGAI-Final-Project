== History ==
{{Further|Timeline of Lubumbashi}}

===Élisabethville under Belgian rule===
The Belgian government established the modern-day government in the city of ''Élisabethville'' (sometimes Elizabethville, both in French, or Elisabethstad in Dutch) in 1910, named in honour of [[Elisabeth of Bavaria (1876–1965)|Queen Elisabeth]], consort to [[King Albert I of the Belgians]].<ref>Britannica,
[https://www.britannica.com/place/Lubumbashi Lubumbashi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211108032140/https://www.britannica.com/place/Lubumbashi |date=8 November 2021 }}, britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref> By that time, the government had taken over the colony from King Leopold II, and renamed it as the [[Belgian Congo]]. This site was chosen by Vice-Governor-General Emile Wangermée because of its proximity to the copper mine of ''[[Etoile du Congo Mine|Etoile du Congo]]'' and the copper ore smelting oven installed by [[Union Minière du Haut Katanga]] on the nearby Lubumbashi River.

The ''[[Comité Spécial du Katanga]]'' (CSK), a semi-private concessionary company set up in 1900, had its headquarters in Élisabethville throughout the colonial era. It enjoyed major privileges, mainly in terms of land and mining concessions, in the Katanga province.

The city prospered with the development of a regional copper mining industry.<ref>Brion, R. and J.-L. Moreau (2006), ''De la mine à Mars, La genèse d'Umicore'', Tielt : Lannoo.</ref> Huge investments in the 1920s, both in the mining industry and in transport infrastructure (railline Elisabethville-Port Francqui and Elisabethville-Dilolo), developed the Katanga province into one of the world's major copper ore producers. The population of the city grew apace from approx. 30,000 in 1930, to 50,000 in 1943 and 180,000 in 1957. It was the second city of the [[Belgian Congo]], after Léopoldville.
[[File:Belgian Neighborhood, Lubumbashi, DRC.jpg|thumb|The Belgian Quarter in Lubumbashi]]

As was customary with European colonies, the city centre of Élisabethville was reserved for the minority white (European) population. This consisted mainly of Belgian nationals, but the city also attracted important British and Italian communities, as well as [[History of the Jews in Greece|Jewish Greeks]]. Congolese were allowed in the white city only during the day, except for the house servants ("boys") who often lived in shanty dwellings ("boyeries") located in the backyards of the European city houses.

Many men in the black population were labour immigrants from neighbouring regions in the Belgian Congo (Northern Katanga, Maniema, Kasaï), from [[Ruanda-Urundi|Belgian Rwanda and Burundi]], and from British [[Northern Rhodesia]] (present-day [[Zambia]]).<ref>Fetter, Bruce (1976), ''The Creation of Elisabethville, 1910–1940'', Stanford: Hoover Institution Press.</ref> The black population lived initially in a so-called ''cité indigène'' called ''Quartier Albert'' (now Kamalondo), south of the city centre and separated from the white city by a 700-metres-wide neutral zone. With population growth, new indigenous quarters were created. These still form the main suburbs of present-day Lubumbashi: Kenia, Katuba, and Ruashi. The work and businesses related to the mines made Élisabethville the most prosperous region of the Congo during the last decade of Belgian rule. In 1954, there were 8,000 black homeowners in the city while thousands more were skilled workers. It was estimated that black Africans living in Élisabethville had a higher standard of living than anywhere else on the continent at that time.<ref>John Gunther,''Inside Africa,'' Hamish Hamilton Ltd. London, 1955, page 640</ref>
[[File:Lubumbashi Palais de Justice 2.jpg|thumb|right|Lubumbashi Palace of Justice, c. 1920s]]

Miners in Élisabethville conducted a strike in December 1941 to protest the increasingly severe [[Forced labor|forced-labour]] regime that the Belgians imposed on the population because of the "war efforts".<ref>Dibwe dia Mwembu, Donatien (2001), ''Histoire des conditions de vie des travailleurs de l'Union Minière du Haut-Katanga et Gécamines, 1910–1999'', Lubumbashi : Presses Universitaires de Lubumbashi.</ref> A rally in the Union Minière football stadium got out of hand. Police opened fire and numerous protesters were killed. In early 1944, the city was again in the grip of severe tensions and fear of violent protests, following a mutiny of the [[Force Publique]] (army) in Luluabourg.<ref>Rubens, Antoine (1945), ''Dettes de guerre'', Lubumbashi: L'essor du Congo.</ref>

Starting in 1933, the Belgian colonial authorities experimented with a limited form of self-governance by establishing the cité indigène of Élisabethville as a so-called ''centre extra-coutumier'' (a centre not subject to customary law). It was administered by an indigenous council and presided over by an indigenous chief. But due to constant interference from the Belgian authorities, the experiment soon proved a failure.<ref>Grévisse, F. (1951), ''Le Centre Extra-Coutumier d’Elisabethville'', Elisabethville-Bruxelles: CEPSI-Institut Royal Colonial Belge.</ref> The first indigenous chief – Albert Kabongo – appointed in 1937, was dismissed in 1943 and not replaced.

In 1957, Élisabethville was established as a fully autonomous city; it held the first free municipal elections in which the Congolese could vote. The people of Élisabethville gave a vast majority to the nationalist [[Alliance des Bakongo]], which demanded immediate independence from Belgium.

Élisabethville functioned as the administrative capital of the Katanga province. It was also an important commercial and industrial centre, and a centre of education and health services. The [[Benedictine Order]] and missionary [[Order of Salesians]] offered a wide range of educational facilities to Europeans and Congolese alike, including vocational training (Kafubu). The Belgians established the University of Élisabethville in 1954–1955 (now the [[University of Lubumbashi]]).
[[File:Lubumbashi cathedral S Pierre et Paul.jpg|thumb|[[Sts. Peter and Paul Cathedral, Lubumbashi|Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral]]]]

=== Lubumbashi from 1960 ===
Élisabethville served as the capital and centre of the secessionist independent state of [[State of Katanga#Secession|Katanga]] during the 1960–1963 Congolese civil war. [[Moise Tshombe]] proclaimed Katangan independence in July 1960. Congolese leaders arrested him and charged him with treason in April 1961; however, he agreed to dismiss his foreign advisers and military forces in exchange for his release. Tshombe returned to Élisabethville but repudiated these assurances and began to fight anew. United Nations troops opposed Katangan forces and took control of the city in December 1961 under a strong mandate. [[Roger Trinquier]], well known for his published works on counter-insurgency warfare, served as a French military advisor to President Tshombe until international pressure, led by Belgium, caused his recall to France.

[[Mobutu Sese Seko]] ultimately assumed power of the Congo, which he renamed Zaïre. He renamed Élisabethville as "Lubumbashi" in 1966 and in 1972 renamed Katanga as "Shaba."

In May 1990, the university campus of Lubumbashi was the scene of a brutal killing of students by Mobutu's security forces. In 1991–92 ethnic tensions between the Luba from Katanga and the Luba from Kasaï, resident in the city, led to violent confrontations and the forced removal from the city of the latter.

Congo entered another genocidal civil war in the late 1990s. The [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo]] rebels [[Capture of Lubumbashi|captured Lubumbashi]] in April 1997. Rebel leader [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]] spoke from Lubumbashi to declare himself president of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] on 17 May 1997 after Mobutu Sese Seko fled Kinshasa.

When Laurent-Désiré Kabila decided to appoint a transitional parliament, in 1999, he decided to install the Parliament in Lubumbashi, in order to consolidate the fragile unity of the country. The parliament was installed in the building of the National Assembly of secessionist Katanga (the former city theatre), which had its capital in this city as well, in the 1960s. Lubumbashi was therefore the Legislative capital of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] from 1999 to 2003, when all the country's central institutions were brought back to Kinshasa.

On 7 September 2010 a large prison break happened in Lubumbashi after gunmen attacked a prison on the outskirts of the city. 960 prisoners managed to escape, including the [[Mai-Mai]] leader [[Gédéon Kyungu Mutanga]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39478&Cr=democratic&Cr1=congo |date=7 September 2011 |access-date=8 September 2011 |title=UN voices concern after mass prison outbreak in DR Congo |publisher=UN News Center |archive-date=22 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422101353/http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39478&Cr=democratic&Cr1=congo |url-status=live }}</ref> On 23 March 2013 a militia group of 100 fighters attacked Lubumbashi and seized a United Nations compound, which was surrounded by Congolese soldiers and members of the president's Republican Guard.<ref name=BloombergKavanagh />

== Geography ==
{{further ill|List of communes of Lubumbashi|fr|Liste des communes de Lubumbashi}}
Lubumbashi lies at around {{Convert|1208|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The high altitude serves to cool the climate, which would otherwise be very hot. The [[Kafue River]] rises along the Zambian border near the city and meanders through north-central [[Zambia]] to the [[Zambezi River]], cutting a long, deep panhandle into the country.

===Climate===
Lubumbashi has a dry-winter [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cwa'', according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]), with warm rainy summers and pleasant, dry winters, with most rainfall occurring during summer and early autumn. Annual average rainfall is 1,238&nbsp;mm (48.75 inches).

Other parks (or farms) include Mikembo and Futuka (once a reserve, now closed) on Kasenga Road in the city's outskirts.

===Zoo===
The zoo of Lubumbashi is one of the most visited tourist attractions. It was created during the colonial period, and is considered the most attractive zoo in the country. During the years of war, it deteriorated but it has been rehabilitated by AZLU, a non-profit organization. By 2007, great animals had been acquired for the zoo. AZLU is keeping the zoo "for education purposes, and the protection of the natural heritage of the country," as it can be read on signs. Today, it has almost been restocked with lions, tigers, monkeys, apes, pelicans, wart hogs, crocodiles, snakes, turtles, monitor lizards, eagles, parrots, ostriches, gazelles, etc. Apart from animals, the zoo features a restaurant, a veterinary center, and a termite museum.

All of these different periods coalescing in one city is something I wanted to address.'<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ocula.com/magazine/conversations/sandrine-colard/ |title=Sandrine Colard on the 6th Lubumbashi Biennale |last=Balogun |first=Emmanuel |date=13 Dec 2019 |website=Ocula Magazine |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191216210942/https://ocula.com/magazine/conversations/sandrine-colard/ |archive-date=16 December 2019 |access-date=1 Feb 2020}}</ref>

===Art===
[[Bogumil Jewsiewicki|Bogumił Jewsiewicki]] says that contemporary Lubumbashi art making is weak, especially when compared to the Kinshasan. He writes,
<blockquote>"No Lubumbashi popular painter has had an international career like that of the Kinshasa artist Chéri Samba, and there are in fact a number of artists and musicians in Kinshasa whom the whirlwind of international success has whisked farther from local audiences than any artist in Lubumbashi, and not only in Lubumbashi but in the surrounding province of Katanga."<ref>[[Jacques Brassinne|Brassinne, J.]] and [[Jean Kestergat|Kestergat, J.]] (1991). ''Qui a tué Patrice Lumumba?'' Paris : Duculot. P 141. {{ISBN|2-8011-0979-7}}.</ref></blockquote>He names painters like Pilipili, Mwenze, Angali, Nkulu wa Nkulu, Maka, Tshimbumba, Dekab, and others.

===Cinema===
Ciné Bétamax, formerly "Ciné Palace" and "Ciné Eden",<ref>Jewsiewicki, B. (1999). ''A Congo Chronicle: Patrice Lumumba in Urban Art''. New York: The Museum for African Art. P 13. {{ISBN|0-945802-25-0}}</ref> are the only modern movie theaters in the city which generally show popular recent [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] productions as well as NC-17 films. However, they also show movies about Congolese and African recent history like ''[[Mister Bob]],'' ''[[Sniper: Reloaded]],'' ''[[SEAL Team 8: Behind Enemy Lines]],'' and ''[[Tears of the Sun]].'' Before films, they both showed Congolese and international music videos, and US wrestling. The communication department of the University of Lubumbashi has collaborated with the movie theater to show students’ films.

Ciné Bétamax in particular also screens great football matches, and local singers’ concerts and Christian meetings are regularly held here. 

Nigeria's [[Nollywood]] films are also, as in many other parts of the DRC and Africa, popular among the residents. These films are often sold on VCD and DVD platforms.

===Music===
The popular music from Kinshasa is much appreciated and played in Lubumbashi. [[Jean-Bosco Mwenda]] is likely the most famous Katangese musician. Many of his songs have become classical, and are endlessly remixed by new young artists. Modern Lubumbashi singers fall into two groups: those who play Soukous, such as Jo Kizi and Képi Prince, and those who play international urban music, such as Ced Koncept, Tshumani, M-Joe, [[RJ Kanierra]], Oxygène, Agresivo, Nelson Tshi, and Da Costa on the other. Most artists are influenced by successful Dj Spilulu's productions, Kinshasa singers [[Fally Ipupa]], [[Ferré Gola]] and [[World music|World Music]].

Lubumbashi music is characterized by the use of many languages (Swahili, Lingala, Tshiluba, French and some English) in the lyrics. It is rare to hear songs composed in only one language. This code switching and mixing expresses the cosmopolitan character of the city, but some critics think it weakens the lyrics, which seem to be particularly made for teenagers anyway. Serge Manseba and Karibyona are humorist-singers featured by G'Sparks.

===French cultural influence===
The "Institut Français" (formally known as "Centre Culturel Français"), located in the heart of the city, contributes a great deal to the cultural and artistic life of Lubumbashi. Students and researchers spend time in its library; it shows European and other French-language films; produces plays and other shows in its theater; and features local singers’ records for sale on display at the entrance.

===Radio Okapi's cultural participation===
[[Radio Okapi]]'s Lubumbashi presenters participate each Saturday evening in ''"métissage,"'' the cultural program of the radio. The whole country is informed of the cultural activities in the city.

== Media ==
===National channel (RTNC/Katanga)===
RTNC (Congolese National Radio and Television) has a provincial station located in Lubumbashi district at the junction of Lubilanshi and Sandoa. It has been very influential from the 1960s to the mid-1990s, at the end of the one-party system, and before the information technology revolution.

===Independent channels===
Zenith Radio, the first independent radio station in the city, started broadcasting in 1996; since then numerous radio and television stations have been established. They can be classified in three groups: religious channels (Zenith, RTIV, Canal de Vie, RNS, etc.), commercial channels (RTA, Mwangaza, [[Nyota Radio Television|Nyota]], RTLJ, Malaïka, Kyondo, etc.), and mixed ones like Wantanshi Radio and Television.

== Sports ==
===Football===
Football is the most popular sport in Lubumbashi. The city is home to [[association football|football]] clubs of the top national level such as [[FC Saint Eloi Lupopo]], [[CS Don Bosco]] and [[TP Mazembe]]. TP Mazembe is the most successful club in national competitions and the most successful Congolese club in international football achieving 5 [[CAF Champions League|Africa's Champions League]] and reaching a [[FIFA Club World Cup]] final. The Chairman of Mazembe is the former governor of the province of Katanga [[Moïse Katumbi Chapwe]].

Until 1960, Congolese football was segregated between whites-only and blacks-only leagues and competitions. In 1911 the whites-only Ligue de Football du Katanga was founded in Elisabethville, organising in 1925 the first official local championship called the B. Smith Cup.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rsssf.org/tablesk/katanga.html |title=DR Congo (Zaire) - Katanga Champions |website=[[RSSSF]] |access-date=2018-05-24 |archive-date=1 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180901114448/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesk/katanga.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] tournament was won by teams from Lubumbashi every recorded season except 2005. Simultaneously three blacks-only regional tournaments were played in the country. In 1950, the 'black' Elisabethville Football Association (FASI, Fédérations et Associations Sportives Indigènes) had over 30 affiliated clubs competing in four leagues divided over 3 divisions.

Both black and white tournaments in Lubumbashi and the country were played simultaneously until 1960, when they were unified. Since then the traditionally black clubs have dominated both local and national football.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=https://www.rsssf.org/tablesz/zaire-regchamp.html |title=Congo-Kinshasa (DR Congo; formerly Zaire) - Regional Champions |website=[[RSSSF]] |access-date=2018-05-24 |archive-date=6 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506103501/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesz/zaire-regchamp.html#kat |url-status=live }}</ref>

The 'black' Ligue de Football du Elisabethville, now renamed the Ligue de Football du Lubumbashi, is the city's football tournament, organized since 1960 by the city's federation EFLU. FC Saint-Eloi Lupopo won the EFLU league 25 times in all up to 2003 being the most successful club in the seasons for which records are known (some are not known).
