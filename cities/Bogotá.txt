Bogotá was founded as the capital of the [[New Kingdom of Granada]] on 6 August 1538 by Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] after a harsh [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|expedition into the Andes]] conquering the [[Muisca people|Muisca]], the indigenous inhabitants of the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense|Altiplano]]. Santafé (its name after 1540) became the seat of the government of the Spanish Royal [[Audiencia Real|Audiencia]] of the [[New Kingdom of Granada]] (created in 1550), and then after 1717 it was the capital of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]]. After the [[Battle of Boyacá]] on 7 August 1819, Bogotá became the capital of the [[Colombian Declaration of Independence|independent]] nation of [[Gran Colombia]]. It was [[Simón Bolívar]] who rebaptized the city with the name of Bogotá, as a way of honoring the Muisca people and as an emancipation act towards the Spanish crown.<ref name=":1" /> Hence, since the Viceroyalty of New Granada's independence from the [[Spanish Empire]] and during the formation of present-day Colombia, Bogotá has remained the capital of this territory.

<!--geography and climate-->
The city is located in the center of Colombia, on a high plateau known as the [[Bogotá savanna]], part of the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] located in the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Cordillera]] of the [[Andes]]. Its altitude averages {{convert|2640|m|ft|sp=us}} above sea level. Subdivided into 20 localities, Bogotá has an area of {{convert|1587|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off|sp=us}} and a cool climate that is constant through the year.

<!--law and economy-->
The city is home to central offices of the executive branch ([[President of the Republic|Office of the President]]), the legislative branch ([[Congress of Colombia]]) and the judicial branch ([[Supreme Court of Justice of Colombia|Supreme Court of Justice]], [[Constitutional Court of Colombia|Constitutional Court]], [[Council of State (Colombia)|Council of State]] and the [[Superior Council of Judicature]]) of the Colombian government. Bogotá stands out for its economic strength and associated financial maturity, its attractiveness to global companies and the quality of [[human capital]]. It is the financial and commercial heart of Colombia, with the most business activity of any city in the country.<ref name="Hotspots">{{Cite web |url=http://www.citigroup.com/citi/citiforcities/pdfs/eiu_hotspots_2012.pdf |title=Hot spots: Benchmarking global city competitiveness |publisher=The Economist Intelligence Unit |access-date=5 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516142055/http://www.citigroup.com/citi/citiforcities/pdfs/eiu_hotspots_2012.pdf |archive-date=16 May 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name = "TheTalentIssue"/> The capital hosts the main financial market in Colombia and the [[Andean natural region]], and is the leading destination for new foreign direct investment projects coming into [[Latin America]] and Colombia.<ref name="investmentIBM">{{Cite web |url=http://es.investinbogota.org/noticias/ibm-destaca-bogota-como-la-ciudad-con-mayor-numero-de-proyectos-de-inversion-extranjera-en |title=IBM destaca a Bogotá como la ciudad con mayor número de proyectos de inversión extranjera en Latinoamérica |publisher=IBM-Plant Location International (IBM-PLI) |access-date=5 January 2016 |language=es |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105131049/http://es.investinbogota.org/noticias/ibm-destaca-bogota-como-la-ciudad-con-mayor-numero-de-proyectos-de-inversion-extranjera-en |archive-date=5 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> It has the highest nominal [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] in the country, responsible for almost a quarter of the nation's total (24.7%).

The name of Bogotá corresponds to the Spanish pronunciation of the [[Chibcha language|Chibcha]] ''[[Bacatá]]'' (or Muyquytá) which was the name of a neighboring settlement located between the modern towns of Funza and Cota. There are different opinions about the meaning of the word Muyquytá, the most accepted being that it means "walling of the farmland" in the Chibcha language.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://archivobogota.secretariageneral.gov.co/content/historia-bogota|title=Historia de Bogotá {{!}} Archivo de Bogotá|website=archivobogota.secretariageneral.gov.co|access-date=10 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190731231517/http://archivobogota.secretariageneral.gov.co/content/historia-bogota|archive-date=31 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ngenespanol.com/travel/cual-es-el-origen-del-nombre-de-bogota-colombia/|title=¿Cuál es el origen del nombre de "Bogotá"?|date=13 August 2018|website=National Geographic en Español|language=es-MX|access-date=10 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190320151235/https://www.ngenespanol.com/travel/cual-es-el-origen-del-nombre-de-bogota-colombia/|archive-date=20 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Another popular translation argues that it means "The Lady of the [[Andes]]".<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcnradio.com/bogota/ni-santa-fe-no-bacata-estos-fueron-los-primeros-nombres-de-bogota|title=Ni Santa Fe ni Bacatá: estos fueron los primeros nombres de Bogotá|date=6 August 2018|website=RCN Radio|language=es|access-date=10 September 2019|archive-date=4 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804231326/https://www.rcnradio.com/bogota/ni-santa-fe-no-bacata-estos-fueron-los-primeros-nombres-de-bogota|url-status=live}}</ref> Others suggest that Bacatá was the name of the Muisca [[cacique]] who governed the land before the Spaniards arrived.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Blanco Barros|first=Jose Agustin|title=Historia de Bogotá|url=https://www.sogeocol.edu.co/documentos/fund_bogota.pdf|journal=Sociedad Geográfica de Colombia Academia de Ciencias Geográficas|access-date=10 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309065432/https://www.sogeocol.edu.co/documentos/fund_bogota.pdf|archive-date=9 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada|Jiménez de Quesada]] gave the settlement the name of "Our Lady of Hope" but the Spanish crown gave it the name of Santafé (Holy Faith) in 1540 when it was appointed as a city.<ref name=":0" /> The [[Muisca people|Muisca]], the indigenous inhabitants of the region, called the place on which the city was founded "Thybzaca" or "Old Town".

{{main|History of Bogotá}}
{{For timeline|Timeline of Bogotá history}}
The area of modern Bogotá was first populated by groups of indigenous people who migrated south based on the relation with the other [[Chibchan languages|Chibcha languages]]; the Bogotá savanna was the southernmost Chibcha-speaking group that exists from Nicaragua to the Andes in Colombia. The civilization built by the [[Muisca people|Muisca]], who settled in the valleys and fertile highlands of and surrounding the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] (modern-day [[Departments of Colombia|departments]] of [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] and [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]] and small parts of [[Santander Department|Santander]]), was one of the great civilizations in the Americas. The name [[Muisca Confederation]] has been given to a loose egalitarian society of various chiefs (''caciques'') who lived in small settlements of maximum 100 ''[[Muisca architecture|bohíos]]''. The [[Muisca agriculture|agriculture]] and [[Muisca economy#Salt|salt-based]] society of the people was rich in goldworking, [[Muisca economy#Trade|trade]] and [[Muisca mummification|mummification]]. The [[Muisca religion|religion]] of the Muisca consisted of various gods, mostly related to natural phenomena as the Sun ([[Sué]]) and his wife, the Moon; [[Chía (goddess)|Chía]], rain [[Chibchacum]], rainbow [[Cuchavira]] and with building and feasting ([[Nencatacoa]]) and wisdom ([[Bochica]]). Their complex [[Muisca calendar|luni-solar calendar]], deciphered by [[Manuel Arturo Izquierdo Peña|Manuel Izquierdo]] based on work by [[José Domingo Duquesne|Duquesne]], followed three different sets of years, where the [[sidereal year|sidereal]] and [[Synodic period|synodic]] months were represented. Their [[Muisca astronomy|astronomical knowledge]] is represented in one of the few extant landmarks of the [[Muisca architecture|architecture]] of the Muisca in ''[[El Infiernito]]'' outside [[Villa de Leyva]] to the north of Bogotá.

The first populations inhabiting the present-day [[Metropolitan Area of Bogotá]] were [[hunter-gatherer]]s in the late [[Pleistocene]]. Dating to around 12,500 [[Before Present|BP]], the oldest evidence of human activity was discovered in ''[[El Abra]],'' north of [[Zipaquirá]]. Other excavations in a rock shelter southwest of the city in [[Soacha]] provided ages of ~11,000 BP; [[Tequendama]]. Since roughly 0 AD, the local Muisca people domesticated [[guinea pig]]s as a source of dietary meat.<ref>Correal Urrego, 1990, p.13</ref> The people inhabiting the [[Bogotá savanna]] in the late 15th century were the [[Muisca people|Muisca]], speaking ''[[Chibcha language|Muysccubun]]'', a member of the [[Chibcha language#Comparison to other Chibchan languages|Chibcha]] language family.<ref name="ElCarnero">{{Cite book|title=El Carnero|author=Rodríguez, J.F.|publisher=Bedout|year=1982|location=Medellín, Colombia|language=es|trans-title=The Ramp|orig-year=1859}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2020}} Muisca means "people" or "person", making "Muisca people", how they are called, a [[tautology (grammar)|tautology]]. At the arrival of the [[Conquistador|Spanish conquistadores]], the Muisca population was estimated to be half a million indigenous people on the Bogotá savanna, and up to two million in the [[Muisca Confederation]]. They occupied the highland and mild climate flanks between the [[Sumapaz Paramo|Sumapaz Mountains]] to the southwest and [[Sierra Nevada del Cocuy|Cocuy]]'s snowy peak to the northeast, covering an approximate area of {{convert|25000|km²|0|abbr=on}}, comprising Bogotá's high plain, a large portion of the modern-day department of [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá department]] portion and a small area in the [[Santander Department|Santander]] region.

Trade was the most important activity of the Muisca with other Chibcha-speaking neighbours,<ref>Francis, 1993, p.36</ref> such as the [[Guane people|Guane]], [[Lache people|Lache]] and [[U'wa people|U'wa]] and with [[Cariban languages|Cariban-speaking]] groups such as the [[Muzo people|Muzo]] or "Emerald People". Their knowledge of salt production from brines, a task devoted exclusively to [[Women in Muisca society|Muisca women]], gave them the name of "Salt People".<ref name=Daza_2728>Daza, 2013, pp.27–28</ref> Tropical fruits that did not grow on the cool highlands, as well as [[coca]], [[cotton]] and [[gold]] were all traded at markets that took place every Muisca week; every four days. At these frequent markets, the Muisca obtained various luxury goods that appear worthless in a modern sense, as well as precious metals and gemstones that seem valuable to us and which became abundant and were used for various purposes.<ref>Daza, 2013, pp.23</ref> The [[Muisca warfare|Muisca warrior elite]] were allowed to wear feathered crowns, from parrots and macaws whose habitat was to the east of the Andes; the [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]]-speaking [[Guayupe people|Guayupe]], [[Tegua people|Tegua]] and [[Achagua people|Achagua]].

The [[Muisca cuisine]] consisted of a stable and varied diet of [[tubers]], [[potato]]es and fruits. [[Maize]] was the main ingredient of the Muisca, cultivated on [[Muisca agriculture|elevated and irrigated terraces]]. Many words exist in Muysccubun for ''maize'', ''corn'' and [[Muisca cuisine|the various types and forms of it]].<ref name=Daza_2728/> The product was also the base for [[Chicha#Colombia|chicha]]; the alcoholic beverage of the people, still sold in central Bogotá today. It was the beverage used to celebrate the construction of houses, harvests and sowing, ritual practices around the various sacred sites of the Altiplano, [[Muisca music|music and dances]], trade at special fairs with farther away trading indigenous groups of Colombia and to inaugurate the new highest regarded member of the community; ''zipas'', ''zaques'', ''caciques'' and the religious ruler ''[[iraca]]'' from [[Sun Temple (Sogamoso)|Sacred City of the Sun]] [[Sogamoso|Sugamuxi]].<ref>Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.1, p.18</ref>

=== Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada expedition and Spanish conquest ===
{{main|Spanish conquest of the Muisca}}
From 1533, a belief persisted that the Río Grande de la [[Magdalena River|Magdalena]] was the trail to the [[Pacific Ocean|South Sea]], to [[Perú]], legendary ''[[El Dorado]]''. Such was the target of [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]], the Granadanian [[List of conquistadors in Colombia|conquistador]] who left [[Santa Marta]] on 6 April 1536 with 800 soldiers, heading towards the interior of current [[Colombia]]. The expedition divided into two groups, one under Quesada's command to move on land, and the other commanded by Diego de Urbino would go upriver in four brigantine ships to eventually meet Quesada's troops at the site named Tora de las Barrancas Bermejas. When they arrived, they heard news about Indians inhabiting the south and making large salt cakes used to trade for wild cotton and fish. Jiménez de Quesada decided to abandon the route to [[Peru]] and cross the mountain in search of salt villages. They saw crops, trails, white salt cakes and then huts where they found corn, yucca and beans. From Tora, the expedition went up the Opón River and found indigenous people wearing very finely painted cotton mantles. When they arrived in Muisca territories in the Andean Plateau, on 9 March 1537, of the expedition leaving [[Santa Marta]], only 162 men were left.<ref name=BancoList>{{in lang|es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/historia/gennrgun/gennrgun9x.htm List of conquistadors led by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309181315/http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/historia/gennrgun/gennrgun9x.htm |date=9 March 2016 }} – [[Banco de la República]]</ref>

The ''zipa'' at the moment of [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|Spanish conquest]] was [[Tisquesusa]]. His main ''bohío'' was in a small village called ''Bacatá'' with others in [[Funza]] and [[Cajicá]], giving name to the present day capital of Colombia. ''Bacatá'' was actually located near to the modern location of the city of [[Funza]]. A prophecy in his life came true; ''he would be dying, bathing in his own blood''. Defending Funza with a reduced army of [[Muisca warfare|guecha warriors]] against the heavily exhausted but heavily armed strangers, his reign fell in the hands of Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada and his younger brother [[Hernán Pérez de Quesada|Hernán Pérez]] on 20 April 1537. Upon his death, his brother [[Sagipa]] became the last ''zipa'', against the [[Women in Muisca society|inheritance tradition of the Muisca]]. Sagipa used to be a main captain for Tisquesusa but quickly submitted to the Spanish rulers. The first [[encomienda|encomenderos]] asked high prices in valuable products and agricultural production from the indigenous people. On top of that epidemics of European viruses razed through the population, of which in current [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]] 65–85 % of the Muisca were killed within 100 years.<ref>Francis, 2002</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2020}}

Jiménez de Quesada decided to establish a military campament in the area in 1538, in the site today known as the [[Chorro de Quevedo]] square. The foundation was performed by the construction of 12 houses of reed, referring to the [[Twelve Apostles]], and the construction of a preliminary church, also of reed. With the celebration of the first [[Mass in the Catholic Church|mass]] in the campament, celebrated by [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar [[Domingo de las Casas]] the city was founded with the name of Nuestra Señora de la Esperanza (Our Lady of Hope) on 6 August 1538.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" /> Quesada placed his right foot on the bare earth and said simply, "I take possession of this land in the name of the most sovereign emperor, Charles V."

[[File:CatedralPrimadaBogota2004-7.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|[[Bolívar Square]] and the [[Primatial Cathedral of Bogotá|cathedral]]]]
This founding, however, was irregular as no town council was formed nor were town officials appointed, as well as lacking some other juridical requirements for an official founding. As a consequence, the official founding only occurred about eight months later, on 27 April 1539, in a site close to one of the recreational lands of the ''zipa'', called Theusa or Theusaquillo.<ref name=":0" /> This official founding involved an official ceremony appointing a council and officials, and the demarcation of streets and lands, and in it fellow conquistadores [[Sebastián de Belalcázar]] and [[Nikolaus Federmann]] were present. While this was the official date of founding, traditionally it is the 6 August 1538 that is considered the date of the actual foundation.

The village obtained the title of City by way of a decree from [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] on 27 July 1540, which changed the name of the city from Our Lady of Hope to Santa Fe (Holy Faith), after the name of a town nearby [[Granada]] where Jiménez de Quesada grew up.<ref name=":2" /> Jiménez de Quesada and conquerors [[Sebastián de Belalcázar|De Belalcázar]] and [[Nikolaus Federmann|Federmann]] left for Spain in April 1539, founding [[Guataquí]] together on 6 April 1539. The rule over the newly created [[New Kingdom of Granada]] was left to Jiménez de Quesada's brother, [[Hernán Pérez de Quesada]]. The first mayors of the city were captains [[Pedro de Arevalo]] y [[Jeronimo de Inzar]]. The city obtained the Title of Muy Noble y Muy Leal (Very Noble and Loyal) on 17 August 1575 by a decree from [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip II]]. Bogotá, then called Santa Fe, later became the capital of the later [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]].<ref name="ElCarnero" />{{page needed|date=August 2020}} Following the independence from Spain, Bogotá became capital of [[Gran Colombia]] and later the capital of the [[Republic of Colombia]].

The city mayor and the chapter formed by two councilmen, assisted by the constable and the police chief, governed the city. For better administration of these domains, in April 1550, the [[Real Audiencia|Audiencia]] of Santafé was organized<!--, for Hearers to act-->. Santa Fe (or Santafé) became the seat of the government of the [[New Kingdom of Granada]] . Fourteen years later in 1564, the Spanish Crown designated the first Royal Audiencia chairman, [[Andrés Díaz Venero de Leiva|Andrés Díaz Venero de Leyva]]. The Chapter and the Royal Audience were located on the other side of what is today the [[Bolívar Square|Plaza de Bolívar]] (then called, Plaza Mayor or Major Square). The street connecting the Major Square and the Square of Herbs— now Santander Park— was named ''Calle Real'' (Royal Street), now ''Carrera Séptima'' (or "Seventh Street"; counted from the mountains to the east of the city). After 1717 Santafé became the capital of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]].

Formed by Europeans, [[mestizo]]s, indigenous people, and slaves, from the second half of the 16th century, the population began to grow rapidly. The 1789 census recorded 18,161 inhabitants, and by 1819 the city population reached 30,000 inhabitants distributed in 195 blocks. Importance grew when the [[diocese]] was established.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Political unease over the Spanish monarchy and the rights of citizens born in the Americas had been felt throughout the Spanish colonies in America, and it was expressed in New Granada in many different ways, accelerating the movement to independence. One of the most transcendent was the [[:es:Rebelión de los comuneros|Insurrection of the Comuneros]], a riot by the locals that started in [[Socorro, Santander|Villa del Socorro]] —current Department of [[Santander Department|Santander]]—in March 1781.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Comunero-Rebellion|title=Comunero Rebellion {{!}} Colombian history|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=10 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422213846/https://www.britannica.com/event/Comunero-Rebellion|archive-date=22 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Spanish authorities suppressed the riot, and [[José Antonio Galán]], the leader, was executed. He left an imprint, though. One of the soldiers witnessing his execution was an intellectually curious, noble teenager named [[Antonio Nariño]], who was deeply impressed by both the insurrection and the execution. Nariño went on to become a politician in Santafé, and he became acquainted with the liberal ideas in vogue in Europe. He started organizing clandestine meetings with other intellectuals and politicians to discuss and promote the independence of the American colonies from the Spanish crown. In 1794, Nariño clandestinely translated and published in Santa Fe the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|Declaration of the Rights of Men and of the Citizen]], and copies of his translation were distributed all over the continent and started creating a stirring in the political mentalities of the time. The Spanish government had banned the distribution of the pamphlet and soon discovered the material and burned any copy that they could find. Nariño was arrested on 29 August 1794, and sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and to have all of his properties confiscated, and was sent to exile the year after. Those suspected of being part of Nariño's intellectual circle were also persecuted, but his ideas had become widespread.<ref>{{Citation|last=McFarlane|first=Anthony|pages=400|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511529122|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511529122.019|chapter=Cambridge Latin American Studies|title=Colombia before Independence|year=1993}}</ref>

In 1807, following the [[Peninsular War|French invasion of Spain]] and the subsequent [[Abdications of Bayonne|abdication]] of the [[House of Bourbon]] in Spain, pressed by [[Napoleon]] to give the crown to his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]], resulting in the destruction of the Spanish administration, many in Spain and in the American colonies created local resistance governments called [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Juntas]]. The dissolution of the [[Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom|Supreme Central Junta]], following a series of military defeats in the Spanish troops promoted the [[Junta (Spanish American Independence)|creation of local juntas]] all throughout Latin America, which very soon consolidated the independentist ideas already in vogue. After the establishment of a junta in [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena de Indias]] on 22 May 1810, and in many other cities throughout the Viceroyalty, the '''Junta de Santa Fe''' was established on 20 July 1810, in what is often called the [[Colombian Declaration of Independence]]. The Junta adopted the name of "Supreme Junta of the New Kingdom of Granada", and first swore allegiance to Viceroy [[Antonio José Amar y Borbón]], and appointed him as president, but then he was deposed and arrested five days later. After declaring independence from Spain the different juntas attempted to establish a congress of provinces, but they were unable to do so and military conflicts soon emerged.

The period between 1810 and 1816 was marked by intense conflict between federalist and centralist factions over the nature of the new government of the recently emancipated juntas, a period that has become known as ''[[Foolish Fatherland|la Patria Boba]]''. The Province of Santafé became the [[Free and Independent State of Cundinamarca]], which soon became embroiled in a civil war against other of the local juntas which banded together to form the [[United Provinces of New Granada]] and advocated for a federalist government system. Following a failed military campaign against Quito, General [[Simón Bolívar]] of the United Provinces led a campaign that led to the surrender of the Cundinamarca province in December 1814.

In Spain, the war had ended and the [[Spanish monarchy]] was restored on 11 December 1813. King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]] declared the uprisings in the colonies illegal and sent a large army to quell the rebellions and reconquer the lost colonies, for which he appointed General [[Pablo Morillo]]. Morillo led a [[Spanish reconquest of New Granada|successful military campaign]] that culminated in the capture of Santafé on 6 May 1816.

In 1819, [[Simón Bolívar|Bolívar]] initiated his [[Bolívar's campaign to liberate New Granada|campaign to liberate New Granada]]. Following a series of battles, the last of which was the [[Battle of Boyacá]], the republican army led by Bolívar cleared its way to Santafé, where he arrived victorious on 10 August 1819. It was [[Simón Bolívar]] who rebaptized the city with the name of Bogotá, to honor the Muisca people and to emphasize the emancipation from Spain. Bogotá then became the capital of the [[Gran Colombia]].

Between 1819 and 1849, there were no fundamental structural changes from the colonial period. By the mid-19th century, a series of fundamental reforms were enacted, some of the most important being slavery abolition and religious, teaching, print and speech industry and trade freedom, among others. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} During the decade of the 70s, radicalism accelerated reforms and state and social institutions were substantially modified. However, during the second half of the century, the country faced permanent pronouncements, declarations of rebellions between states, and factions which resulted in civil wars: the last and bloodiest was the [[Thousand Days' War]] from 1899 to 1902. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In 1823, a few years after the formation of Gran Colombia, the Public Library, now the National Library, was enlarged and modernized with new volumes and better facilities. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} The National Museum was founded. Those institutions were of great importance to the new republic's cultural development. <!--From half century education secularization and expansion widened formation possibilities.--> The Central University was the first State school, precursor of the current [[National University of Colombia|National University]], founded in 1867 and domiciled in Bogotá.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

=== Regeneration ===
President Rafael Núñez declared the end of Federalism, and in 1886 the country became a centralist republic ruled by the constitution in force – save some amendments – up to 1991. In the middle of political and administration avatars, Bogotá continued as the capital and principal political center of the country.

From a base of only 20,000 people in 1793, the city grew to approximately 117,000 people in 1912. Population growth was rapid after 1870, largely because of emigration from the eastern highlands.<ref>David Sowell, "[http://juh.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/38/4/720?etoc Population Growth in Late-Nineteenth-Century Bogota: Insights on a Demographic Dilemma] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230704161218/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0096144211434990?etoc= |date=4 July 2023 }}", ''Journal of Urban History'' (2012) 38:720–730, {{doi|10.1177/0096144211434990}}. {{Cite journal |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0096144211434990?etoc= |title=Population Growth in Late-Nineteenth-Century Bogotá |doi=10.1177/0096144211434990 |access-date=4 July 2023 |archive-date=4 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230704161218/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0096144211434990?etoc= |url-status=bot: unknown |date=2012 |last1=Sowell |first1=David |journal=Journal of Urban History |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=720–730 }}.</ref>

The city began the 21st century with important changes in its urban space and public transport, looking to plan demographic and economic growth, that would position it as a strategic hub for international business in Latin America. Some of the main interventions initiated looked to develop projects contained in the Plan of Territorial Ordering (POT), which aims to guide the development of the city for the next two centuries.

One of the most important interventions in the city was in its transportation system. In 1967, there were 2,679 urban buses in Bogotá that transported, on average, 1,630,000 passengers per day. The city had about 1 million inhabitants and 80&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of area, the service was relatively reasonable. But as the city grew and reached more than five million and an area greater than 300&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, not only did the car fleet increase substantially to more than 20,000 vehicles, but traffic complexity increased, as well as pollution and the inefficiency of the only existing transportation system.

By the end of the 20th century, the situation was difficult. There was no real urban public transport system that would serve as an alternative to the private vehicle – which further incentivized its use – and the city had low levels of competitiveness in Latin America, as well as an unsatisfactory quality of life for the vast majority of its inhabitants. The administrations of mayors [[Andrés Pastrana]] (1988–90) and Jaime Castro (1992–94), in addition to the first of [[Antanas Mockus]] (1995–97), formulated proposals to solve the problem of public transport, with limited results. It was during the mayoralty of the latter when there was talk about the possibility of establishing a mass transportation system that would help remedy the problem of mobility.

Under the second administration of [[Antanas Mockus]], Bogotá opened a 'zone of tolerancia' which legalized prostitution in a large swath of the center of the city in the Santa Fe neighborhood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/colombia/bogota-zona.htm|title=Primera zona de tolerancia en Bogotá|website=Latin American Studies |access-date=17 October 2019|archive-date=10 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190910233958/http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/colombia/bogota-zona.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

Mayor [[Enrique Peñalosa]] (whose first term was 1998–2000) included in his program as a priority a solution to public transport. Consequently, in the execution of the development plan "For the Bogotá we Want" in terms of mobility and in a mass transportation system project, the construction of special infrastructure exclusively for its operation was determined. This system would include specialized bus corridors, equipped with single-use lanes, stations, bridges, bike paths and special pedestrian access platforms, designed to facilitate the user's experience in the system. However, Peñalosa became infamous for his campaign against the poor, saying he would rather see robbers on the streets, than people selling candies. Peñalosa served a second term (2016–19).

After getting elected in 2011, [[Gustavo Petro]], clashed with the conservative political establishment after remunicipalization of the city's garbage collection system. The inspector general, Alejandro Ordoñez deposed Petro for alleged constitutional overreach when he tried to replace the city's private trash collectors. Petro was reinstated weeks later after a Bogotá court ruled that Ordoñez had overstepped his authority.

Although the proposal for biarticulated diesel buses called "Transmilenio" was in its early stages a success, due in part to the small numbers of passengers it transported, in the long term it became an inefficient and contaminating system, saturated for a metro population of almost ten million, guilty of environmental deterioration and air pollution.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.transmilenio.gov.co/publicaciones/146028/historia-de-transmilenio/|title=Historia de TransMilenio|website=TransMilenio |date=21 August 2013 |access-date=20 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420012617/https://www.transmilenio.gov.co/publicaciones/146028/historia-de-transmilenio/|archive-date=20 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

For its part, the cultural equipment plan of Bogotá has yielded significant results, including the construction of three large public libraries in different sectors. These libraries have not only expanded access to existing library resources but also serve as some of the 150 hubs for [[BibloRed|BibloRed - Bogotá's Public Libraries Network]], including the Bogota Digital Library<ref name="pub113">{{Cite web |title=Biblored, Colombia's Innovative Library Network |url=https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub113/ |access-date=2024-01-16 |website=CLIR |language=en-US |archive-date=16 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240116155420/https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub113/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=BibloRed: innovadora Red De Bibliotecas · Colecciones digitales - Repositorio de BibloRed |url=https://coleccionesdigitales.biblored.gov.co/items/show/886 |access-date=2024-01-16 |website=coleccionesdigitales.biblored.gov.co |archive-date=16 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240116155418/https://coleccionesdigitales.biblored.gov.co/items/show/886 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Biblioteca Digital de Bogotá"/> The new libraries were located in sectors that allow a wide coverage, have easy access by public transport and bike paths; and their projects were commissioned to distinguished architects of the city.

As for 2019, the city's distribution is composed of nine main business centers (Av. El Dorado Business Corridor, Centro Internacional, Parque de la 93, El Lago, North Point, Calle 100, Santa Barbara Business Center, Zona Industrial Montevideo & Parque Industrial Zona Franca). Grittier sides sit south and southwest, where working-class barrios continue to battle their reputations for drugs and crime.

[[File:Hail in Bogota.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hail]]storm in Bogotá]]
[[File:Cerros a la altura de la calle Setenta.JPG|thumb|left|[[Eastern Hills (Bogotá)|Eastern Hills]]]]

Bogotá is located in the southeastern part of the [[Bogotá savanna]] (''Sabana de Bogotá'') at an average altitude of {{convert|2640|m|ft|sp=us}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]].<ref name=Alcaldia/> The Bogotá savanna is popularly called "[[savannah]]" (''sabana''), but constitutes actually a high [[plateau]] in the Andes mountains, part of an extended region known as the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]], which literally means "high plateau of Cundinamarca and Boyacá". Bogotá is the largest city in the world at its elevation; there is no urban area that is both higher and more populous than Bogotá.

In the extreme south of Bogotá's District, the world's largest continuous [[Páramo|paramo]] ecosystem can be found; [[Sumapaz Páramo]] in the locality [[Sumapaz]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.samuelalcalde.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2180%3Aacueducto&Itemid=29 |title=Moors in Latin America |publisher=Samual Calde.com |access-date=1 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225095001/http://www.samuelalcalde.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2180%3Aacueducto&Itemid=29 |archive-date=25 December 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[Bogotá River]] running NE-SW crosses the ''sabana'', forming [[Tequendama Falls]] (''Salto del Tequendama'') to the south. Tributary rivers form valleys with villages, whose economy is based on agriculture, livestock raising and artisanal production.

The ''sabana'' is bordered to the east by the [[Cordillera Oriental, Colombia|Eastern Cordillera]] of the [[Andes]] mountain range. The [[Eastern Hills (Bogotá)|Eastern Hills]], which limit city growth, run from south to north, forming east of the downtown the Guadalupe and [[Monserrate]] mountains. The western city limit is [[Bogotá River]]. The [[Sumapaz Paramo]] ([[moorland]]) borders the south and to the north Bogotá extends over the plateau up to the towns of [[Chía, Cundinamarca|Chía]] and [[Sopó]].

Most of the wetlands in the Bogotá region have disappeared. They covered nearly 50,000 hectares in the 1960s, compared to only 727 in 2019, for a disappearance rate of 98%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sostenibilidad.semana.com/actualidad/articulo/humedales-de-colombia-continuan-en-cuidados-intensivos/42827|title=Humedales de Colombia continúan en 'cuidados intensivos'|access-date=21 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617154609/https://sostenibilidad.semana.com/actualidad/articulo/humedales-de-colombia-continuan-en-cuidados-intensivos/42827|archive-date=17 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Urban layout and nomenclature ===
[[File:How-Bogota-Streets-are-Numbered-and-Named.png|thumb|Street arrangement of Bogotá based on the Cartesian coordinate system: North is to the right. (Typical maps for the city place the north on the left.)]]
[[File:Bogota as seen from Montserrat.jpg|thumb|View of Bogotá from the mountain [[Monserrate]]]]

The colonial city, from 1539 to 1810, barely changed its urban layout and culture. Santafe was slowly leaving behind the colonialism after the independence revolution from 1810 to 1819. Entering the 19th century, the city of Bogotá was still the political and demographic core of Nueva Granada but remained a small city as compared with similar cities, such as Lima and Buenos Aires.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last=Martinez ruiz|first=Enrique|title=Los judíos y la conformación del espacio urbano de Bogotá|publisher=[[Editorial Pontificia Universidad Javeriana]]|year=2018|location=Bogota}}</ref> At the year of 1801, the city had 173 blocks and 21,394 inhabitants marking a slow population growth during the 18th century.<ref name=":3" /> In the beginning of the 19th century, city life was marked by the lack of cultural activity and public services as well as by the excessive Catholic religiosity in its inhabitants, which almost controlled the whole life of people, as a journalist traveler wrote in 1822 (Biblioteca Luis Angel Arango, 1990,2 ).

The city's urban shape remained the same in the 19th century as the 1557 urban landscape as a checkerboard with the Plaza as its core. In other words, the city grew in area adding new square blocks but kept the same urban fabric.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|last=Mejia P|first=German|title=Los años del cambio: historia urbana de Bogotá|publisher=[[Editorial Pontificia Universidad Javeriana]]|year=1999|location=Bogota}}</ref> Buildings were low rise, as a traveler wrote in 1830 (Bibliotheca Luis Angel Arango, 1990,2), where most city buildings had one floor, and a few had no more than two. One special characteristic of those houses with two floors, which were the houses of the wealthiest families of Bogotá, were their balconies. The building facades of Bogotá were very simplistic without ornaments, meaning no more than a wall with windows and the entry door. However, due to the poor street conditions because of the potholes and waste, in addition to the lack of cultural and social activity at night, the ornaments were reserved to indoors where Bogotanos spent most of their time.<ref name=":4" /> One of the few outdoor activities of the people of Bogotá during the first half of the 19th century was going to the Plaza or the "altozano" as the locals called it. The Plaza was the social core of the city, where fresh fruits were sold and where inhabitants from all socioeconomic backgrounds converged (Bibliotheca Luis Angel Arango, 1990,2).

The landscape of Bogotá was very similar from the 16th century to 19th century. Nonetheless, after the milestone fact of the independence from the Spanish, which was a process that lasted at least ten years from 1810 to 1819, some changes started to happen.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mejia P|first=German|title=Los años del cambio: historia urbana de Bogotá, 1820–1910. 1. ed. Santa Fé de Bogotá|publisher=[[Editorial Pontificia Universidad Javeriana]]|year=1999|location=Bogota}}</ref> Those changes were happening slowly while the new republican order was getting power. Trying to make a difference from the colonial ages, the new Republic began changing the name of the plazas, streets and even the name of the city, from Santafe to Bogotá. The names of colonial streets were changed to numbers and the name of plazas were changed to the founding fathers of Colombia.<ref name=":4" /> Thereafter, the empty plazas of the colonial ages turned into ornamented plazas with plenty of trees and civic statues. For instance, the first civil statue placed in a plaza in Colombia was the figure of Bolivar, the main founding father of Colombia. The statue of Bolivar was unveiled on July 20, 1846, which is the Independence Day of Colombia, trying to strengthen the patriotism of the new republic in people of Bogotá and Colombia.<ref name=":4" />

The last quarter of the 19th century, from 1870 to 1900, more clearly marked a new urban landscape of Bogotá. The constant rural migration to Bogotá had been one of the most important factors that allowed the city to maintain its influential power in the region both during the colonial ages and during the republic.<ref name=":3" /> In 1847, the city governor and the council tried to expand the urban area of Bogotá beyond the colonial limits, whereas, only until the 1860s was that expansion encouraged by the president of Colombia Tomas Cipriano de Mosquera.<ref name=":3" /> The Mosquera plan included lotting the western part of Bogotá, building bridges and wider roads and plazas, but that plan was only partially implemented.<ref name=":3" /> In the following decade, other urban initiatives emerged but this time from the private sector. A group of businessmen, tired of the city's slow growth and development, proposed the construction of sewars, theaters, electric systems and new roads in order to hasten the development of Bogotá. Because of the 1876 civil war, the plan could not be implemented, but from that initiative, the council adopted the first urban code of Bogotá in 1875.<ref name=":3" /> These initiatives tried to update the undeveloped city to the new technologies of the 1800s; however, the pace remained slow, and only after 1882, when the train and the trolley came to Bogotá, some urban development projects progressed more quickly.<ref name=":3" />

Today Bogotá has 20 localities, or districts, forming an extensive network of neighborhoods. Areas of higher economic status tend to be located in the north, close to the Eastern Hills in the districts of [[Chapinero]], [[Usaquén]] and the east of [[Suba, Bogotá|Suba]]. The lower middle class inhabit the central, western and northwestern parts of the city.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}. The working-class neighborhoods are located in the south, some of them [[Shanty towns|squatter areas]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}
{{Further|Restrepo, Bogotá}}

The urban layout in the center of the city is based on the focal point of a square or plaza, typical of Spanish-founded settlements, but the layout gradually becomes more modern in outlying neighborhoods. The types of roads are classified as ''Calles'' (streets), which run from west to east horizontally, with street numbers increasing towards the north, and also towards the south (with the suffix "Sur") from Calle 0 down south. ''Carreras'' (roads) run from north to south vertically, with numbering increasing from east to west. (with the suffix "Este" for roads east of Carrera 0). At the southeast of the city, the addresses are logically ''sur-este''. Other types of roads more common in newer parts of the city may be termed ''Eje'' (Axis), ''Diagonal'' or ''Transversal''.
The numbering system for street addresses recently changed, and numbers are assigned according to street rank from main avenues to smaller avenues and local streets. Some of Bogotá's main roads, which also go by a proper name in addition to a number, are:
* Norte-Quito-Sur or NQS (North Quito South Avenue, from 9th Rd at north following railway to 30th Rd, or Quito City Avenue, and Southern Highway)
* [[Autopista Norte]]-Avenida Caracas (Northern Highway, or 45th Rd, joined to Caracas Avenue, or 14th Rd)
* Avenida Circunvalar (or 1st Rd)
* Avenida Suba (60th transversal from 100th St the Suba Hills; 145th St from Suba Hills westward)
* Avenida El Dorado (El Dorado Avenue, or 26th St)
* Avenida de las Américas (Avenue of the Americas, from 34th street at east to 6th street at west)
* Avenida Primero de Mayo (May First Avenue, or 22nd St South)
* Avenida Ciudad de Cali (Cali City Avenue, or 86th Rd)
* Avenida Boyacá (Boyacá Avenue, or 72nd Rd)
* Autopista Sur (Southern Highway)

In Bogotá, as in the rest of the country, urbanization has accelerated due to industrialization as well as complex political and social reasons such as poverty and violence, which led to migration from rural to urban areas throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} A dramatic example of this is the number of displaced people who have arrived in Bogotá due to the internal armed conflict.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Some estimates show that Bogotá's [[floating population]] may be as high as 4 million people, most of them being migrant workers from other departments and displaced people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dane.gov.co/|title=Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística (DANE)|work=dane.gov.co|access-date=10 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227230340/http://www.dane.gov.co/|archive-date=27 February 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> The majority of the displaced population lives in the [[Ciudad Bolívar (Bogotá)|Ciudad Bolívar]], [[Kennedy (Bogotá)|Kennedy]], [[Usme]], and [[Bosa (Bogotá)|Bosa]] sections.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In Bogotá, the accelerated urbanization process is not exclusively due to industrialization, since there are complex political and social reasons such as poverty and violence, which have motivated migration from the countryside to the city throughout the 20th century, determining an exponential growth of the population in Bogotá and the establishment of misery belts in its surroundings. According to the Consultancy for Human Rights, Codhes, in the period 1999–2005 more than 260,000 displaced people arrived in Bogotá, approximately 3.8% of the total population of Bogotá. The locations where the majority of the displaced population is concentrated are Ciudad Bolivar, Kennedy, Bosa and Usme.

In addition to this, the Metropolis currently has over 650 kilometers of urban bicycle paths divided among its 20 boroughs, making it the city with the largest bicycle lane system on the planet. Bogotá massive urban growth during the 20th and 21st centuries due to immigration and rapid urbanization of neighboring cities has placed a strain on the city's downtown avenues and highways, but since the creation of the Bogota Metropolitan area in 1990 significant efforts to upgrade the city's infrastructure have been undertaken, including the construction of several new avenues and boulevards, as well as the construction of the first two lines of the Bogota Metro. In recent years, the capital district has embarked on several city building projects including the expansion of the Avenida Boyaca and Autopista Norte, as well as the construction of the brand new Avenida Guayacanes, a 13-kilometer 8-lane avenue currently being constructed from scratch in the boroughs of Bosa and Kennedy, as well as the excavations for the city's second metro line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2015/08/13/better-transport-water-and-sanitation-for-the-urban-poor-in-bogota|title=Better Transport, Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor in Bogotá|website=Worldbank.org|access-date=19 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518025854/http://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2015/08/13/better-transport-water-and-sanitation-for-the-urban-poor-in-bogota|archive-date=18 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Private car ownership forms a major part of the congestion, in addition to taxis, buses, and commercial vehicles. Buses remain the main means of mass transit. There are two bus systems: the traditional system and the [[TransMilenio]] BRT system. The city's administration is currently in the process of replacing and updating the entire fleet for the [[TransMilenio]] BRT system, adopting Euro VI-standard CNG-powered buses as well as electric buses. Once completed, Bogotá will have the largest electric bus fleet in the world outside China.

The traditional system runs a variety of bus types, operated by several companies on normal streets and avenues: ''Bus'' (large buses), ''Buseta'' (medium size buses) and ''Colectivo'' (vans or minivans). The bigger buses were divided into two categories: ''Ejecutivo'', which was originally to be a deluxe service and was not to carry standing passengers, and ''corriente'' or normal service. Since May 2008, all buses run as ''corriente'' services. Bogotá is a [[Transportation hub|hub]] for domestic and international bus routes. The Bogotá terminal serves routes to most cities and towns in Colombia<ref>{{cite web |year= 2008 |url= http://www.bogota-dc.com/trans/terminal.htm |title= Bogotá Transportation Terminal & Train Station |publisher= Bogotá-dc.com |access-date= 29 December 2008 |language= es |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081224032444/http://www.bogota-dc.com/trans/terminal.htm |archive-date= 24 December 2008 |url-status= live }}</ref> and is the largest in the country. There is international service to Ecuador, Perú and Venezuela.

The [[TransMilenio]] system was created during [[Enrique Peñalosa]]'s mayoral term,<ref>{{cite web |year= 2008 |url= http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/bogota/articulo-millonaria-condena-al-distrito-fallas-transmilenio |title= Millonaria condena al Distrito por fallas en Transmilenio |publisher= El Espectador |access-date= 29 December 2008 |language= es |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110216163714/http://elespectador.com/noticias/bogota/articulo-millonaria-condena-al-distrito-fallas-transmilenio |archive-date= 16 February 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> and is a form of [[bus rapid transit]] that has been deployed as a measure to compensate for the lack of a subway or rail system. TransMilenio combines articulated buses that operate on dedicated bus roads (busways) and smaller buses (feeders) that operate in residential areas, bringing passengers to the main grid. TransMilenio's main routes are: Caracas Avenue, Northern Highway (''[[Autopista Norte]]''), 80th Street, Americas Avenue, Jiménez Avenue, and 30th Avenue (also referred to as ''Norte Quito Sur'' or ''N.Q.S.'' for short). Routes for Suba Avenue and Southern Highway (''Autopista Sur''), the southern leg of the 30th Avenue, were opened in April 2006. The third phase of the system will cover 7th Avenue, 10th Avenue, and 26th Street (or ''Avenida El Dorado''). The system is planned to cover the entire city by 2030. Although the Transmilenio carries commuters to numerous corners of the city, it is more expensive (US$0.80 or 2300 COP) than any public transport, except taxis.

In addition to TransMilenio, the Peñalosa administration and voter-approved referendums helped to establish travel restrictions on cars with certain license plate numbers during peak hours called [[Pico y placa]] (peak, as in hour, and plate, as in license plate); {{convert|121|km|0|abbr=off|sp=us}} of [[Ciclovía]] on Sundays and major holidays; a massive system ({{convert|376|km|0|abbr=on}} {{As of|2013|lc=y}}) of bicycle paths and segregated lanes called ''[[Bogotá's Bike Paths Network|ciclorrutas]]''; and the removal of thousands of parking spots in an attempt to make roads more pedestrian-friendly and discourage car use. ''Ciclorrutas'' is one of the most extensive dedicated bike path networks of any city in the world, with a total extension of {{convert|376|km|0|abbr=off|sp=us}}. It extends from the north of the city, 170th Street, to the south, 27th Street, and from [[Monserrate]] on the east to the [[Bogotá River]] on the west. The ''ciclorruta'' was started by the 1995–1998 [[Antanas Mockus]] administration with a few kilometers, and considerably extended afterwards with the development of a Bicycle Master Plan and the addition of paths hundreds of kilometers in extent.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cambio.com.co/paiscambio/762/ARTICULO-WEB-NOTA_INTERIOR_CAMBIO-3948271.html |title= Bogotanos olvidaron para qué fue creado el Día sin carro |publisher= Cambio |access-date= 29 December 2008 |date= 2 November 2008 |language= es |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080820102143/http://www.cambio.com.co/paiscambio/762/ARTICULO-WEB-NOTA_INTERIOR_CAMBIO-3948271.html |archive-date= 20 August 2008 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> Since the construction of the ''ciclorruta'' bicycle use in the city has increased, and a car free week was introduced in 2014.<ref name=greenblog>{{cite news |last1=King |first1=Danny |title=Bogota citizens give up automobiles in first ever Car Free Week |url=http://green.autoblog.com/2014/02/26/bogota-citizens-give-up-automobiles-first-ever-car-free-week/ |access-date=28 August 2014 |agency=autobloggreen |publisher=green.autoblog.com |date=26 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819223148/http://green.autoblog.com/2014/02/26/bogota-citizens-give-up-automobiles-first-ever-car-free-week/ |archive-date=19 August 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Airports ===
[[File:Aeropuerto Bogotá.JPG|thumb|[[El Dorado International Airport]]]]
Bogotá's main airport is [[El Dorado International Airport]], with an approximate area of {{cvt|6.9|km2}} located west of the city's downtown in the [[Fontibón]] Locality. It is the second most important airport in Latin America after [[Mexico City International Airport]] and it is the most important airport in Colombia. Construction of the airport was ordered by [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla]] (19th President of Colombia) in 1955 to replace the [[:es:Aeropuerto de Techo|Aeropuerto de Techo]]. Due to its central location in Colombia and in Latin America, it is a hub for Colombia's Flagship Carrier [[Avianca]], [[Copa Airlines Colombia]] and [[LATAM Colombia]]. It is also serviced by a number of international airlines including American, Delta, United, Air France, KLM, Turkish Airlines, JetBlue, Lufthansa, Emirates, Iberia and Air Canada. The national airport has begun to take more responsibility due to the congestion at the international airport. In response to the high demand of approximately 27 Million passengers per year,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifly.com/bogota-eldorado-airport|title=Bogota El Nuevo Dorado BOG Airport – Bogota, Colombia|work=ifly.com|access-date=2 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521172031/http://www.ifly.com/bogota-eldorado-airport|archive-date=21 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

A secondary airport, [[Military Transport Air Command (Colombian Air Force)|CATAM]], serves as a base for Military and Police Aviation. This airport, which uses the runways of El Dorado will eventually move to Madrid, a nearby town in the region of Cundinamarca, leaving further space to expand El Dorado.<ref>{{cite web |year=2013 |url=http://colombiareports.co/colombia-to-move-air-force-base-expand-bogota-airport/ |title=Colombia to move military airbase to expand El Dorado airport |publisher=Colombia Reports |access-date=9 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109135011/http://colombiareports.co/colombia-to-move-air-force-base-expand-bogota-airport/ |archive-date=9 January 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Guaymaral Airport]] is another small airport located in the northern boundaries of Bogotá. It is used mainly for private aviation activities.

=== Urban and suburban railways ===
{{Main|Bogotá Metro|Tramways of Bogotá}}
{{See also|Bogotá's Savannah Railway|RegioTram}}
Bogotá has little railway transit infrastructure, following the collapse of the tram network, although a number of plans hope to change that. The [[Bogotá Metro]] has been pushed forward by two successive governments, and construction began in 2020 with opening planned for 2028.<ref>{{cite web |title=Construction of the First Line of the Bogotá Metro begins! |url=https://bogota.gov.co/en/international/construction-first-line-bogotas-metro-begins |website=bogota.gov.co |access-date=10 February 2021 |archive-date=25 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210725163307/https://bogota.gov.co/en/international/construction-first-line-bogotas-metro-begins |url-status=live }}</ref> Plans to construct railways in and out of the city, replacing defunct routes, have been delayed due to the pressing need for transport within the city.<ref>[http://www.elespectador.com/impreso/articuloimpreso90115-se-mueve-el-tren-de-cercanias Se mueve el tren de cercanías] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924070634/http://www.elespectador.com/impreso/articuloimpreso90115-se-mueve-el-tren-de-cercanias |date=24 September 2015 }}, [[El Espectador]], 12 November 2008</ref> A [[tram train]] line using right-of-way from the defunct Bogotá Savannah Railway, known as [[RegioTram]], will be opening in 2023.

=== Bicycle infrastructure ===
{{Main|Bogotá's Bike Paths Network}}
Bogotá has most extensive and comprehensive network of bike paths in Colombia. Bogotá's bike paths network or Ciclorrutas de Bogotá in Spanish, designed and built during the administration of Mayors [[Antanas Mockus]] and [[Enrique Peñalosa]], is also one of the most extensive in the world and the most extensive in Latin America.<ref>{{cite book |title=Colombia |last=Woods |first=Sarah |page=123 |year=2012 |publisher=[[Bradt Travel Guides]] |isbn=9781841623641 }}</ref> The network is integrated with the [[TransMilenio]] bus system which has bicycle parking facilities, therefore rendering it feasible to cross the entire metropolitan area while riding a bike.

Bogotá implemented a healthy lifestyle program called "Ciclovía", through which principal highways are closed from 7:00&nbsp;a.m. until 2:00 pm on Sundays and public holidays. Thanks to the "Ciclovía", the general population rides its bikes enjoying the city as well as exercising. In addition, cars do not circulate as heavily, so there is less pollution. Along the same lines, just during the month of December, the same activity is carried out at night; there are some special amenities and activities, such as fireworks, street theater performances, and street food vendors.

Since 4 April 2016 the [[carrera 11]] has been reduced from four to three car lanes and a new bike lane (''ciclorruta'') has been inaugurated.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/bogota/carrera-11-bogota-volvera-ser-un-solo-sentido-articulo-611894 Carrera 11 de 4 a 3 carriles con un carril doble sentido para bicicletas] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403185808/http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/bogota/carrera-11-bogota-volvera-ser-un-solo-sentido-articulo-611894 |date=3 April 2016 }} – [[Caracol Radio]] – Retrieved 25 April 2016</ref>

=== Tramway ===
On 25 December 1884, the first tramway pulled by mules was inaugurated and covered the route from [[Bolívar Square|Plaza de Bolívar]] to Chapinero,<ref name="PorupRaub2009">{{cite book |author1=Porup, Jens |author2=Raub, Kevin |author3=Reid, Robert |title=Colombia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kw78V-p1aY4C&pg=PA63 |access-date=10 March 2013 |date=6 June 2009 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=978-1-74220-326-3 |pages=63– |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620222901/http://books.google.com/books?id=Kw78V-p1aY4C&pg=PA63 |archive-date=20 June 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> and in 1892, the line connecting Plaza de Bolívar and La Sabana Station started operating. The tramway ran over wooden rails and was easily derailed, so steel rails imported from Britain were eventually installed. In 1894, a tramway car ran the Bogotá–Chapinero line every 20 minutes. {{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} The tram system eventually grew to cover most of the city and its surrounding suburbs. But during the [[Bogotazo]] riots of 1948, the system suffered heavy damage and was forced to close. The economic effects of the [[La Violencia|subsequent civil war]] that followed prevented the damage from being repaired. Parts of the system continued to operate in a reduced state until 1951, when they were replaced by buses. Most of the streetcar tracks were eventually paved over, but exposed tracks can still be seen on many of the older roads of the city, especially downtown and in the [[La Candelaria, Bogotá|La Candelaria]] area, although it has been about 70 years{{When|date=October 2017}} since any vehicles have run on them.

===Bogotá public transportation statistics===
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bogotá, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 97 min. 32% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 20 min, while 40% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 8&nbsp;km, while 16% travel for over 12&nbsp;km in a single direction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bogota Public Transportation Statistics|publisher=Global Public Transit Index by Moovit|url=https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_Colombia_Bogota-762|access-date=19 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901030329/https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_Colombia_Bogota-762|archive-date=1 September 2017|url-status=live}} [[File:CC BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016050101/https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ |date=16 October 2017 }}.</ref>

Due to the constant migration of people into the nation's capital, the availability of quotas for access to education offered by the State free of charge is often insufficient. The city also has a diverse system of colleges and private schools.

There are a number of universities, both public and private. In 2002, there were a total of 113 higher education institutions; in Bogotá there are several universities, most partially or fully accredited by the NAC (National Accreditation Council): [[National University of Colombia]], [[University of the Andes, Colombia]], [[District University of Bogotá]], [[La Salle University, Colombia]], [[University of La Sabana]], [[Pontifical Xavierian University]], [[Our Lady of the Rosary University]], [[Universidad Externado de Colombia]], [[Military University Nueva Granada]], [[Central University (Colombia)|Central University, Colombia]], [[El Bosque University]], University of America, [[Sergio Arboleda University]], [[Jorge Tadeo Lozano University]], [[Pilot University of Colombia]], [[Catholic University of Colombia]], [[Saint Thomas Aquinas University]] and [[National Pedagogic University (Colombia)|Universidad Pedagógica Nacional]].

The city has a University City at the National University of Colombia campus located in the traditional sector Teusaquillo. It is the largest campus in Colombia and one of the largest in Latin America.

=== Cultural history ===
Bogotá gave the Spanish-speaking world [[José Asunción Silva]] (1865–1896), [[Modernism]] pioneer. His poetic work in the novel ''De sobremesa'' has a place in outstanding American literature. [[Rafael Pombo]] (1833–1912) was an [[American romanticism]] poet who left a collection of fables essential part of children imagination and Colombian tradition.

=== Architecture ===
{{Main|List of buildings in Bogotá}}
[[File:Construcción del BD Bacatá.JPG|thumb|upright|[[BD Bacatá]], under construction, will be the city's tallest building.]]

The urban morphology and typology of colonial buildings in Bogotá have been maintained since the late nineteenth century, long after the independence of Colombia (1810). {{citation needed|date=February 2015}} This persistence of the colonial setting is still visible, particularly in La Candelaria, the historical center of Bogotá. Also kept up are the colonial houses of two stories, with courtyards, gabled roofs, ceramic tiles and balconies. In some cases, these balconies were enclosed with glass windows during the Republican period, a distinguishing feature of the architecture of the sector (for example, the House of Rafael Pombo).{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

"Republican Architecture" was the style that prevailed between 1830 and 1930.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Although there were attempts to consolidate a modern architectural language, the only examples seen are University City and White City at the National University of Colombia (constructed 1936–39). This work was developed by German architect [[Leopold Rother]], although architects of rationalist trends participated in the design of campus buildings. There are also architecture trends such as art deco, expressionism and organic architecture. This last trend was typified by Bogotan architects in the second half of the twentieth century such as [[Rogelio Salmona]].

In 2015 [[BD Bacatá]] was inaugurated, surpassing the [[Torre Colpatria|Colpatria Tower]] to become the tallest building of the city and of Colombia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bdbacata.com/|title=BD Bacatá – Sitio Oficial|work=bdbacata.com|access-date=31 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328103033/http://bdbacata.com/|archive-date=28 March 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The building its expected to be the beginning of the city's downtown renovation.

It stood out in programs, the library network and the presence of organizations that, in a coordinated manner, are working to promote books and reading in the city. Several specific initiatives for the World Book Capital program have been undertaken with the commitment of groups, both public and private, engaged in the book sector.

The city is home to the [[Biblored]], a network which administers 146 small and four large public libraries (Biblioteca Virgilio Barco, Biblioteca El Tintal, Biblioteca El Tunal and Biblioteca Julio Mario Santodomingo).<ref name="pub113"/> It also has six branches of the Library Network of the Family Compensation Fund Colsubsidio and libraries and documentation centers attached to institutions like the Museo Nacional de Colombia (specializing in old books, catalogs and art), [[Bogotá Museum of Modern Art]], the Alliance Française, and the Centro Colombo Americano.

Another set of libraries are the new collaborative initiatives between the state, city and international agencies. Examples are the Cultural Center Gabriel García Marquez, custom designed by the Fondo de Cultura Economica in Mexico, and the Spanish Cultural Center, which will begin construction with public funds and of the Spanish government in downtown Bogotá. {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The [[National Library of Colombia]] (1777), a dependence of the Ministry of Culture and the Biblioteca Luis Angel Arango (1958), a dependence of the Bank of the Republic are the two largest public libraries in the city. The first is the repository of more than two million volumes, with an important collection of ancient books. The latter has almost two million volumes, and with {{convert|45000|m2|sqft|lk=out|abbr=on}} in size, it hosts 10,000 visitors a day; the Library Alfonso Palacio Rudas is also a dependence of the Bank of the Republic, and is located at the north of the city, with about 50,000 volumes. Other large public libraries are the Library of Congress in Colombia (with 100,000 volumes), of the Instituto Caro y Cuervo (with nearly 200,000 volumes, the largest Latin American library in Philology and Linguistics), the Library of the Academy of History The Library of the Academy of Language, the Library of the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History ICANH, and many university libraries.

Bogotá is home to historical records housed in the General National Archive, a collection of about 60 million documents, one of the largest repositories of primary historical sources in Latin America. Bogotá is also home to the Musical Archive of the Cathedral of Bogotá (with thousands of books and choral song-colonial period), the Archdiocesan Archive, the Archive of the Conciliar Seminary of Bogotá, the Archive History National University of Colombia and the Archive of the Mint in Bogotá, under the Bank of the Republic.

== Symbols ==
The flag originated with the insurgency movement against the colonial authorities which began on 20 July 1810, during which the rebels wore armbands with yellow and red bands, as these colors were those of the [[Flag of Spain|Spanish flag]] used as the flag for the New Kingdom of Granada. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

On 9 October 1952, exactly 142 years after these events, decree 555 of 1952 officially adopted the patriotic armband as the flag of Bogotá.<ref>{{cite web|year=2007 |url=http://www.bogotaturismo.gov.co/ciudad/simbolos/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110707052924/http://www.bogotaturismo.gov.co/ciudad/simbolos/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 July 2011 |title=Simbolos de Bogotá |publisher=Alcaldía Mayor de Bogotá |access-date=29 December 2008 |language=es }}</ref> The flag of Cundinamarca follows the same pattern, plus a light blue tile which represents the Virgin Mary's cape.

The flag itself is a yellow band above a red one. The yellow denotes the gold from the earth, as well as the virtues of justice, clemency, benevolence, the so-called "mundane qualities" (defined as nobility, excellence, richness, generosity, splendor, health, steadfastness, joy and prosperity), long life, eternity, power and constancy. The red denotes the virtue of charity, as well as the qualities of bravery, nobility, values, audacity, victory, honor and furor, Colombians call it the blood of their people. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The coat of arms of the city was granted by emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V (Charles I of Spain)]] to the [[New Kingdom of Granada]], by royal decree given in [[Valladolid]], Spain on 3 December 1548. It contains a black eagle in the center, which symbolizes steadfastness. The eagle is also a symbol of the Habsburgs, which was the ruling family of the Spanish empire at the time. The eagle is crowned with gold and holds a red pomegranate inside a golden background. The border contains olive branches with nine golden pomegranates on a blue background. The two red pomegranates symbolize audacity, and the nine golden ones represent the nine states which constituted the New Kingdom of Granada at the time. In 1932 the coat of arms was officially recognized and adopted as the symbol of Bogotá. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Bogotá's anthem lyrics were written by Pedro Medina Avendaño; the melody was composed by Roberto Pineda Duque. The song was officially declared the anthem by decree 1000 31 July 1974, by then Mayor of Bogotá, Aníbal Fernandez de Soto.
