Madurai is closely associated with the [[Tamil language]]. The third [[Tamil Sangam]], a major congregation of Tamil scholars, is said to have been held in the city.

Signs of human settlements and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] trade links dating back to 300 BCE are evident from excavations by [[Archeological Survey of India]] in Manalur.<ref name="auto"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/A-site-of-human-settlements-turned-into-a-coconut-grove/articleshow/47401066.cms|title=A site of human settlements turned into a coconut grove|work=The Times of India|access-date=12 October 2015|archive-date=7 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607014336/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/A-site-of-human-settlements-turned-into-a-coconut-grove/articleshow/47401066.cms|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/archaeological-excavation-in-sivaganga-uncovers-pandyaroman-trade-links/article7328683.ece|title=Archealogical excavation uncovers Roman Pandyan trade links|work=The Hindu|access-date=12 October 2015|archive-date=27 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127172506/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/archaeological-excavation-in-sivaganga-uncovers-pandyaroman-trade-links/article7328683.ece|url-status=live}}</ref> The city is believed to be of significant antiquity and has been ruled, at different times, by the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandyan Kingdom]], [[Chola Empire]], [[Madurai Sultanate]], [[Vijayanagar Empire]], [[Madurai Nayaks]], [[Nawab of the Carnatic|Carnatic kingdom]], and the [[British East India Company|British East India Company's]] [[British Raj]].

==Etymology==
According to [[Iravatham Mahadevan]], a 2nd-century BCE [[Tamil-Brahmi]] inscription refers to the city as ''matiray'', an Old Tamil word meaning a "walled city".<ref>{{cite book |last=Mahadevan|first=Iravatham |date=3 October 2003|title=Early Tamil Epigraphy from the Earliest Times to the Sixth Century A.D. |publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674012275}}</ref>

Madurai is one of the many temple towns known for Arshad in the state which is named after the groves, clusters or forests dominated by a particular variety of a tree or shrub and the same variety of tree or shrub sheltering the presiding deity. The region is believed to have been covered with Kadamba forest and hence called Kadambavanam.<ref>{{cite book|title=Alayam - The Hindu temple - An epitome of Hindu Culture|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|year=2013|location=Mylapore, Chennai|last=Reddy|first=G.Venkatramana|isbn=978-81-7823-542-4|page=10}}</ref> The city is referred by various names including "Madurai", "Koodal",  "Malligai Maanagar", "Naanmadakoodal" and "Thirualavai". It is believed that ''Madurai'' is the derivative of the word ''Marutham'', which refers to the type of landscape of the [[Sangam Age|Sangam age]]. A town in the neighbouring [[Dindigul district]] is called Vada Madurai (''North Madurai'') and another in [[Sivagangai district]] is called [[Manamadurai]].

''Koodal'' means an assembly or congregation of scholarly people, referring to the three Tamil Sangams held at Madurai. Naanmadakoodal, meaning the junction of four towers, refers to the four major temples for which Madurai was known for.<ref name=Harman/> The sangam literature mentions the [[Koodal Azhagar temple]] at the centre of the city. Historians are of the opinion that [[Koodal Azhagar temple]] finds mention in [[Sangam literature]] (3rd century BCE–3rd century CE) in works like ''Madurai Kanchi'' by Mangudi Marudan, ''[[Paripāṭal]]'', ''[[Kaliththokai]]'' and ''[[Silappatikaram]]''. ''Madurai Kanchi'' details the Thiruvonam festival celebrated in the temple. [[Koodal Azhagar temple]] is revered in ''[[Nalayira Divya Prabhandam]]'', the 5th–9th century Vaishnava canon, by [[Periazhwar|Periyalvar]], [[Thirumalisai Alvar]] and [[Thirumangai Azhwar|Thirumangai Alvar]]. The temple is classified as a ''[[Divyadesam|Divya Desams]]'', one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book.<ref>M., Rajagopalan (1993). 15 Vaishnava Temples of Tamil Nadu.

The Buddhist text [[Mahāvaṃsa|Mahavamsa]] mentions Madurai in the context of [[Prince Vijaya]]'s (543–505 BCE) arrival in Sri Lanka with his 700 followers. According to the Mahavamsa, emissaries laden with precious gifts, jewels and pearls, were sent from Sri Lanka to Madurai of ancient [[Tamilakam]]. Their mission was to secure a bride for Prince Vijaya. The Pandyan King of Madurai agreed to the proposal. He not only sent his own daughter to marry Prince Vijaya but also requested other families to offer their daughters to marry the prince's ministers and retainers. So, along with the Princess and hundreds of maidens, craftsmen and a thousand families from the eighteen [[guild]]s were also sent to Sri Lanka.<ref name="Geiger 1912 59"/>

==Architecture==
[[File:Madurai Map OSM002.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Madurai showing core centre of the city and some important landmarks|alt=map of city showing main streets in the centre of a city]]
Madurai is built around the [[Koodal Azhagar temple]] and [[Meenakshi Temple]], which acted as the geographic and ritual centre of the ancient city of Madurai. The city is divided into a number of concentric quadrangular streets around the temple.<ref name=King72>[[#King|King 2005]], p. 72</ref> [[Viswanatha Nayak]] (1529–64 CE), the first Madurai Nayak king, redesigned the city in accordance with the principles laid out by ''[[Shilpa Shastras]]'' (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|śilpa śāstra}}'', also anglicised as ''silpa sastra'' meaning rules of architecture) related to urban planning. These squares retain their traditional names of Aadi, Chittirai, Avani-moola and Masi streets, corresponding to the Tamil month names and also to the festivals associated.<ref name=King72/>

The temple ''[[prakaram]]s'' (outer precincts of a temple) and streets accommodate an elaborate festival calendar in which dramatic processions circumambulate the shrines at varying distances from the centre. The temple chariots used in processions are progressively larger in size based on the size of the concentric streets.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Selby |first1=Martha Ann |first2=Indira Viswanathan|last2= Peterson |title=Tamil geographies: cultural constructions of space and place in South India |year=2008 |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7914-7245-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B0_lLAechPcC|page=149}}</ref> Ancient Tamil classics record the temple as the centre of the city and the surrounding streets appearing liken a lotus and its petals.<ref name="Bard12" /> The city's axes were aligned with the four-quarters of the compass, and the four gateways of the temple provided access to it. The wealthy and higher echelons of the society were placed in streets close to the temple, while the poorest were placed in the fringe streets. With the advent of British rule during the 19th century, Madurai became the headquarters of a large colonial political complex and an industrial town; with urbanisation, the social hierarchical classes became unified.<ref name="King72" />

As is typical for Tamil Nadu, Madurai has a [[semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid climate]] (''BSh''), although it borders closely upon a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Aw/As'').

Madurai is hot and dry for eight months of the year. Cold winds are experienced during February and March as in the neighbouring [[Dindigul]]. The hottest months are from March to July.
