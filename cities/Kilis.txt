Its population is 112,187 (2022).<ref name=tuik>{{Cite web |title=Address-based population registration system (ADNKS) results dated 31 December 2022, Favorite Reports|url=https://biruni.tuik.gov.tr/medas/?kn=95&locale=en |access-date=19 September 2023|publisher=[[TÜİK]]|language=en|format=XLS}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Exterior_of_16th-Century_Tekke_Mosque_-_Kilis_-_Turkey_(5772594464).jpg|thumb| Exterior of 16th-Century Tekke Mosque]]
[[File:Interior_of_Tekke_Mosque_-_Kilis_-_Turkey_-_02_(5772044823).jpg|thumb| Interior of Tekke Mosque]]

Although there aren't any definite information related to its foundation, today's Kilis mainly developed and became urbanized during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period. However, traces of important cities found in the near surroundings of Kilis and the historical documents prove that important centres were always present here in every period. In the tablets belonging to the [[Assyria]]n period, the name 'Ki-li-zi' is written in cuneiform and a city named as "Ciliza Sive Urnagiganti" during the [[Roman Empire]] period is mentioned.

In addition to centers such as Kirus antique city, Oylum Höyük, [[Ravendel|Ravanda Castle]], Ilezi and Tarzime Han, many other residential areas starting from the Neolithic period have also been discovered in the surrounding of Kilis as a result of archaeological surface explorations. Hittite, Greek, Persian, Roman, Byzantine, Crusader, Mamluk and Ottoman periods were experienced in the region respectively.

As a result of the researchers, it has been determined that the 2 oldest structures (Ulu Mosque, 1388 and Katrancı Mosque, 1460) in the city center of Kilis belong to the [[Mameluk|Mamluk]] Period. Besides these two mosques approximately 135 monumental structures have being constructed since 1516 during the Ottoman Period.

The population of Kilis was 20.000 and it was a city in which production, commerce and cultural functions were developed at the end of the 19th century and it was also a center in which agricultural products (such as grapes, cereals etc.) cultivated in nearly 500 villages around it was processed and industrial products were produced and marketed.

As in the whole Ottoman geography, members of the three major religions are living here together and culture and art are highly developed. 37 [[mosque]]s, 14 small mosques, 4 Dervish Lodges, 8 [[madrasah]]s, 4 [[church (building)|churches]], 1 [[synagogue]], 31 fountains, 5 [[Turkish bath]]s, 40 coffee houses, 5 pharmacies and 5 drinking houses that were present in the city at the end of the 19th century give information about the social and cultural structure here. [[Poetry]], [[music]] and [[handicraft]]s and especially architecture was developed. 

Kilis was part of the [[Aleppo Vilayet]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] until the [[First World War]], after which it passed to the Republic of [[Turkey]]. There was also an Armenian and Jewish community.<ref> [https://books.google.com/books?id=77RtAAAAMAAJ&q=Information+comes+from+the+Jewish+communities+of+Antakya+Bodrum+Bursa+Canakkale+Corlu+Edirne+Finike+Gelibolu+Iskendorun+Istanbul+Izmir+Kilis+Kirklarelli+Manisa+and+Tire+plus+a+few+scattered+stones+from+other+Gazi-Antep p. 40.]</ref> 

Being a [[border town]], Kilis has long had a reputation for smuggling and drug trafficking. Although this has apparently been reduced, even today cigarettes, spirits and cheap electrical items can be bought for cash at low prices. During the [[Syrian Civil War]], the city became a target of continuous [[ISIL rocket attacks on Turkey (2016)|rocket attacks by ISIL]]. in April 2016, the town was struck by rockets fired by the [[Islamic State]] killing 21 people and injuring others.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-19/four-dead-as-rockets-hit-teachers'-dormitory-in-turkish-town/7336574  ABC News Australia: "Four dead as rockets hit teachers' dormitory in Turkish town of Kilis near Syria border"] 18 Apr 2016</ref><ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-turkey-border-idUSKCN0Y71JG Reuters: "Anger, fear sweeps Turkish border town under attack from Islamic State" BY HUMEYRA PAMUK]  May 16, 2016</ref> [[Öncüpınar Accommodation Facility]] is near the town.

==Geography==
Kilis is surrounded by three important cities, [[Gaziantep]], [[Antakya]], and [[Aleppo]], and located at the crossroads of Anatolia and Syria. As a result of its proximity to the Mediterranean Sea, it is located in a region where the climate transitions from a [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] to a continental character. It is also located on the [[Fertile Crescent]], which has been home to settlements since the very beginning of history. 

The [[Öncüpınar]] [[Syria]]n border crossing is {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the south and the large city of [[Gaziantep]] is {{convert|60|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the north. Indeed, until 1996 Kilis was a district of [[Gaziantep Province]], being made into a province by [[Tansu Çiller]] following an open vote-winning gambit in the 1995 general election.

The municipality consists of 76 neighbourhoods, including [[Öncüpınar, Kilis|Öncüpınar]] and [[Oylum, Kilis|Oylum]].<ref>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx Mahalle], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 1 March 2023.</ref>
