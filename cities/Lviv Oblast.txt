==History==
===Name===
The region is named after the city of [[Lviv]] which was founded by [[Daniel of Galicia]], the [[King of Galicia]], in the 13th century, where it became the capital of [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia|Galicia-Volhynia]]. Daniel named the city after his son, [[Leo I of Halych|Leo]]. During this time, the general region around Lviv was known as [[Galicia-Volhynia]]- one of the strongest and most stable kingdoms in Eastern Europe of that time.

===Early history===
[[File:JABLONSKI(1847) p286 - BEŁZ.jpg|thumb|left|19th-century view of [[Belz]], one of the oldest towns in the region]]
The oblast strategic position at the heart of central Europe and as the gateway to the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] has caused it to change hands many times over the centuries. In the [[Early Middle Ages]], the territory was inhabited by the [[Lendians]], an old [[Polish tribes|Polish tribe]]. It was ruled variously by [[Great Moravia]], [[Duchy of Poland|Poland]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Buko|first= Andrzej|title=The Archeology of Early Medieval Poland|year=2008|location=Leiden|page=307|isbn=978-90-04-16230-3}}</ref> [[Kievan Rus']], the [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]] (circa 1200 to 1340; from 1246 under the suzerainty of the [[Golden Horde]]), and then ruled by the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] and [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (1340 to 1772). Apart from the Polish and Ruthenian population, there were sizeable [[Scots in Poland|Scottish]] and [[Armenians in Poland|Armenian]] communities in [[Lviv]] and [[Brody]] during Polish rule.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wijaczka|first=Jacek|editor-last1=Kopczyński|editor-first1=Michał|editor-last2=Tygielski|editor-first2=Wojciech|year=2010|title=Pod wspólnym niebem.

The region's historically dominant Ukrainian population declared the area to be a part of an independent [[West Ukrainian National Republic]] in November 1918 — June 1919, but this endured only briefly. Local autonomy was provided in international treaties but later on those were not honoured by the Polish government and the area experienced much ethnic tension between the [[Polish people|Polish]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] population.

===Establishment===
The oblast was created as part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] on 4 December 1939 following the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet invasion of eastern Poland]] and [[Soviet annexation of Eastern Galicia and Volhynia|annexation of Eastern Galicia and Volhynia]]. Several [[NKVD prisoner massacres]] were committed in the area in 1941, including at [[NKVD prisoner massacres in Lviv|Lviv]], [[NKVD prisoner massacre in Sambir|Sambir]] and [[Dobromyl]].

It was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] from 1941 to 1944 following the start of [[Operation Barbarossa]], where most of the [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|local Jewish population]] were killed. The Germans also established several [[German prisoner-of-war camps in World War II|prisoner-of-war camps]] with multuple [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] subcamps in the region for [[German atrocities committed against Soviet prisoners of war|Soviet]], [[French prisoners of war in World War II|French]] and Belgian POWs, who were subjected to beatings, hunger, epidemics and executions, resulting in a high death rate.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Megargee|first1=Geoffrey P.|last2=Overmans|first2=Rüdiger|last3=Vogt|first3=Wolfgang|year=2022|title=The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos 1933–1945. Volume IV|publisher=Indiana University Press, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|pages=313, 315–317, 324, 331|isbn=978-0-253-06089-1}}</ref> Following the end of [[World War II]], the region remained in Soviet hands as was arranged in the [[Tehran Conference|Tehran]] and [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]] conferences. Most [[Polish population transfers (1944–46)#Transfers from Ukraine|local Poles were expelled]] and [[Expulsion of Ukrainians from Poland to the Soviet Union|Ukrainians expelled from Poland]] arrived.

As a result of the [[1951 Polish–Soviet territorial exchange]] the area of [[Belz]] passed from Poland to the Lviv Oblast, whereas the area of [[Ustrzyki Dolne]] passed from the [[Drohobych Oblast]] to Poland. In 1959, Drohobych Oblast was incorporated into Lviv Oblast.

===Present day===
Given its historical development, Lviv Oblast is one of the least [[Russification of Ukraine|Russified]] and [[Sovietization|Sovietized]] parts of Ukraine, with much of its Polish and [[Austria-Hungary#Territorial legacy|Habsburg]] heritage still visible today.

In Ukraine today, there are three provinces ([[Oblasts of Ukraine|oblasts]]) that formed the eastern part of the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]. Two of these, Lviv Oblast and [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast]] were entirely contained in the kingdom; the third oblast of [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopil]] was mainly in the kingdom apart from four of its most northerly counties (raions). The counties of the Kingdom of Galicia remained largely unchanged when they were incorporated into successor states; with minor changes as detailed below, the current counties are almost co-extensive with those of the Kingdom.

During the 2014 [[Euromaidan]] protests, the region is also notable for having declared independence from the central government led by [[Viktor Yanukovych]] who started to use active military force against protestors.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ukraine-facing-civil-war-lviv-declares-independence-yanukovich-rule-1437092 |title=Ukraine Facing Civil War: Lviv Declares Independence from Yanukovich Rule}}</ref> During Ukraine's [[decommunization in Ukraine|decommunization]] process that accelerated after 2014, Lviv Oblast became the first region of Ukraine to remove all its Soviet-era monuments by January 2024.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Peleschuk |first=Dan |date=30 January 2024 |title=Ukraine's Lviv becomes first region to remove all Soviet-era monuments |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-lviv-becomes-first-region-remove-all-soviet-era-monuments-2024-01-30/ |work=Reuters}}</ref>

==Geography==
The terrain of Lviv Oblast is highly varied. The southern part is occupied by the low [[Beskids]] mountain chains running parallel to each other from northwest to southeast and covered with secondary [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] forests as part of the Eastern [[Carpathians]]; the highest point is [[Pikui]] (1408 m). North from there are the wide upper [[Dniester]] river valley and much smaller upper [[San River]] valley. These rivers have flat bottoms covered with alluvial deposits, and are susceptible to [[flood]]s. Between these valleys and Beskyd lies the Precarpathian upland covered with deciduous forests, with well-known [[mineral spa]] resorts (see [[Truskavets]], [[Morshyn]]). It's also the area of one of the earliest industrial [[Extraction of petroleum|petroleum]] and gas extraction. These deposits are all but depleted by now.

In the central part of the region lie [[Roztocze|Roztochchia]], [[Opillia]], and part of the [[Podolia]] uplands. Rich [[sulphur]] deposits were mined here during the Soviet era. Roztocze is densely forested, while Opillia and Podolia (being covered with [[loess]] on which fertile soils develop) are densely populated and mostly covered by arable land. In the central-north part of the region lies the Small Polesia lowland, geographically isolated from the rest of [[Polesia]] but with similar terrain and landscapes (flat plains with sandy [[fluvioglacial deposits]] and [[pine]] forests). The far North of the region lies on the [[Volhynia]] upland, which is also covered with [[loess]]; coal is [[coal mining|mined]] in this area.

==Climate==
The climate of Lviv Oblast is moderately cool and humid. The average January temperatures range from {{convert|-7|°C|0|abbr=on|lk=out}} in the [[Carpathians]] to {{convert|-3|C|F|abbr=on}} in the [[Dniester]] and [[San River]] valleys while in July the average temperatures are from {{convert|14|-|15|C|F|abbr=on|lk=out}} in the Carpathians to {{convert|16|-|17|C|F|abbr=on}} in [[Roztocze|Roztochchia]] and {{convert|19|°C|0|abbr=on}} in the lower part of the [[Dniester]] valley.<ref>[http://www.worldclimate.com/cgi-bin/data.pl?ref=N49E024+1202+0004133G2 WorldClimate.com (Data for L'viv)]</ref> The average annual precipitation is {{convert|600|-|650|mm|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} in the lowlands, {{convert|650|–|750|mm|2|abbr=on}} in the highlands and up to {{convert|1000|mm|2|abbr=on}} in the Carpathians, with the majority of precipitation occurring in summer. Prolonged [[drought]]s are uncommon, while strong rainfalls can cause [[flood]]s in river valleys. Severe winds during storms can also cause damage, especially in the highlands. The climate is favourable for the cultivation of [[sugar beet]]s, [[winter wheat]], [[flax]], [[rye]], [[cabbage]], [[apple]]s, and for [[dairy farming]]. It is still too cold to successfully cultivate [[maize]], [[sunflower]], [[grape]]s, [[melon]], [[watermelon]] or [[peach]]es in Lviv Oblast. In the [[Carpathians]] conditions are favourable for [[Alpine skiing]] 3–4 months a year.

Until the big district reform on July 18, 2020, Lviv Oblast was administratively subdivided into 20 [[raions]] ([[district]]s), as well as 9 city ([[municipality|municipalities]]) which are directly subordinate to the oblast government: [[Boryslav]], [[Sheptytsky|Chervonohrad]], [[Drohobych]], [[Morshyn]], [[Novyi Rozdil]], [[Sambir]], [[Stryi]], [[Truskavets]], and the administrative center of the oblast, [[Lviv]].

==Historical and cultural sites==
The city of Lviv contains a well-preserved main square (Rynok) and numerous historical churches. Other sites of interest are the historic [[Lychakiv Cemetery]], the local museum of folklore, and the ruins of the famous [[Lviv High Castle|Vysokyi Zamok]]. The name of the castle is closely tied to the name of the city. There is also a museum of military artifacts, the "[[Lviv Arsenal|Arsenal]]".

Well-preserved local wooden churches, castles, and monasteries can be found throughout the Oblast. One of them is the [[Olesko Castle]] which is first recorded in 1327. Another castle that was built at the end of the 15th century is [[Svirzh Castle]] in the village of Svirzh. One more and no less famous castle is the [[Pidhirtsi Castle]]. Its architectural complex consists of the three-story palace, Kostel, and small park. In Roztochia is also located the Krekhivsky monastery in the beech-pine grove at the foot of the Pobiina mount. The whole complex consists of the Saint Nicholas Church, the bell tower, numerous service structures, and defensive walls with towers. Another site worth of mentioning is the Tustan city-fortress which is built in the rock. The site was nominated as the historical and as the natural wonder of Ukraine. There also a nature complex in the valley of the Kamianka river in Stryi Raion. Another natural wonder of the region is the Kamin-Veleten (''Rock-Giant in English'') which is located near city of [[Pidkamin]] in [[Zolochiv Raion, Lviv Oblast|Zolochiv Raion]]. The name of the local city means ''Under the Rock''. A local museum of Ukrainian art and an institution of higher learning (Ivan Franko State University) are also present.
