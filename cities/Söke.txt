==Etymology==

Modern Söke is identified with the ancient Greek city of [[Annaea]] ({{langx|grc|Ἄνναια, Ἄναια, Ἀναία}}) (also referred to as Anea, Anaea, Anaia or Annaia), which was named after the [[Amazons|Amazon]] Anaea (Ἀναία).<ref name=dgrg/> Later, it was also called ''Sokia'' ({{langx|el|Σώκια}}). As of 1920, the [[British people|British]] were calling it '''Sokia'''.<ref name=Prothero101>{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Anatolia|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|page=101|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11766/view/1/101/}}</ref> Anaia is also the name of a [[titular see]] ([[Anaea (Asia)#Titular see|Anaea]]) of the Catholic and Orthodox churches. From 1833 to 1922, it was the seat of the Diocese of Anea of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. After that date, the demographics of the population changed and Orthodox Christians declined in number in the area.

== History ==
Settled for centuries before the [[Common Era]], the region was called ''Aneon'' ({{langx|el|Ανέων}}) and was inhabited by Greeks. 
[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], quoting [[Ephorus]], mention that the tomb of the amazon Anaea was at the city.<ref>{{cite book| last = Mary Bennett| first = Florence | title = Religious Cults Associated With the Amazons| url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm| publisher = Forgotten Books |date= December 2007 | isbn = 978-1605063867}}</ref>
During the [[Peloponnesian War]], some [[Samos|Samian]] exiles migrated there. In addition, [[Thucydides]] mentioned that there was a naval station, and it was near enough to annoy [[Samos]].<ref name=dgrg>{{cite DGRG|title=Annaea or Anaea|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:entry=annaea-geo}}</ref>

In 1426 the city was captured by the [[Ottoman Empire]] under [[Murad II]] as the remaining capital of the [[Sanjak]] of Menteşe. From 1867 until 1922, Söke was part of the [[Aidin Vilayet]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. After the [[First Balkan War]], many Muslim refugees from the [[Balkans]] settled around this area.

According to the [[1914 population statistics for the Ottoman Empire|1914 Ottoman population statistics]], the district of Karaburun had a total population of 36.976, consisting of 20.028 Muslims, 16.720 [[Ottoman Greeks|Greeks]], 133 [[Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|Armenians]], and 95 [[History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire|Jews]].<ref>[[Kemal Karpat]] (1985), [https://kupdf.net/downloadFile/59e4a7b908bbc56144e653d7 ''Ottoman Population, 1830-1914, Demographic and Social Characteristics''], [[The University of Wisconsin Press]], pp. 174-175</ref>

In 18 May 1919, Italian troops landed at Söke. The [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] were afraid that the Italian landing might provoke trouble with the Greek troops, who were near [[Smyrna]]. Although Italy and Greece were allies during [[WWI]], their relations were not good.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article62190230 |title=Greeks Displeased. |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)]] |volume=LXXXIV |issue=22,640 |location=South Australia |date=2 June 1919 |access-date=5 July 2018 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

After the end of [[World War I]], fighting continued in a power struggle after the break-up of the Ottoman Empire. In 1920, large [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and [[Arab]] forces were fighting against the occupying Italian forces.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article128692475 |title=Nine Wars On: Vast Sums for Armament |newspaper=[[The World's News]] |issue=989 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=27 November 1920 |access-date=5 July 2018 |page=12 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> 

In April 1922 Italian troops were withdrawn and Greek troops entered the area.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article223950654 |title=SOKIA OCCUPIED |newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |issue=3581 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=24 April 1922 |access-date=5 July 2018 |page=8 (FINAL EXTRA) |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> After the defeat of the Greek army in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)]], Greek troops was withdrawn, and Turkish troops entered in September 1922. Greek inhabitants of the area evacuated to Greece together with the Greek army or they were killed by the advancing Turkish troops.<ref>{{cite book| last = Kiminas| first = Demetrius | title = The Ecumenical Patriarchate: A History of Its Metropolitans with Annotated Hierarch Catalogs| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QLWqXrW2X-8C| publisher = Wildside Press|date= March 2009| page = 83| isbn = 978-1434458766}}</ref>  
The Turkish resistance in the area was led by one Cafer [[Efe (zeibek)|Efe]] (''Djafer Efe''); a statue was erected later here to commemorate him. 

During the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] in the 1920s, the Greek Christian population migrated to the Greek island of Crete and the [[Cretan Muslims]] moved here.

== Geography ==
The district lies between the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coast and the edge of the fertile [[alluvial plain]] of the [[Büyük Menderes River]]. [[Lake Bafa]] is to the south of the district. The plain contains much rich agricultural land; it is one of Turkey's largest cotton-growing areas and is also important for the commodities of wheat and flour. Other income comes from handicrafts, forestry, and fishing. Söke is Turkey's only exporter of culinary snails.

Söke is a large town in the centre of the Aegean region, and the market town is at the heart of an agricultural district. Although secondary to the nearby centres of tourism on the coast, [[Kuşadası]], [[Didim]] and [[Bodrum]], Söke does catch passing trade from the tourist visitors to the area, including visitors to the nearby historical site of [[Priene]]. There are a number of amenities on the highway for tourists passing through from [[İzmir]] airport to the coast, including restaurants, service stations, and outlet stores. The local cuisine includes ''[[List of kebabs#Turkish kebabs|çöp şiş]]'' (a [[shish kebab]] of small pieces of lamb) and [[Flatbread|pide]] (a flat bread pizza).
