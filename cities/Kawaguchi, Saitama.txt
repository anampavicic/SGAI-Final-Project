{{Nihongo|'''Kawaguchi'''|川口市|Kawaguchi-shi}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] located in [[Saitama Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. {{As of|2021|01|01}}, the city had an estimated [[population]] of 607,373 in 293,582 households and a [[population density]] of 9800 persons per km².<ref name="Kawaguchi-hp">{{cite web |url=https://www.city.kawaguchi.lg.jp/material/files/group/7/z02sng.pdf |title= Kawaguchi city official statistics|location= Japan|language= ja}}</ref> The total area of the city is {{convert|61.95|sqkm|sqmi}}. It is the [[Greater Tokyo Area]]'s 8th most populated city (after passing [[Hachioji]]), and second largest in Saitama Prefecture, after eponymous [[Saitama (city)|Saitama]].

==Geography==
Kawaguchi is located near the center of the [[Kantō Plain]] in southern Saitama Prefecture, and is bordered by the Tokyo wards of [[Kita-ku, Tokyo|Kita-ku]] and [[Adachi-ku, Tokyo|Adachi-ku]] to the south. The city area is mostly flat and mainly residential except for the Omiya tableland, which occupies part of the north and east area. The [[Arakawa River (Kanto)|Arakawa River]] runs across the border with Kita-ku to the south.

==Demographics ==
As of May 1, 2010, registered population was 516,409, including 20,808 alien residents, continuing a trend of population growth in the city since 1933 when the city was founded. There has been a gradual increase in the number of non-Japanese residents living in the city because of the convenient location to Tokyo and relatively low rent. Now, the number of people from China is the largest, followed by Korea and Philippines.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.moj.go.jp/nyuukokukanri/kouhou/press_090710-1_090710-1.html| title = Press release June 2009| author = Ministry of Justice}}</ref>

Kawaguchi is a typical suburb city in the [[Greater Tokyo Area|Tokyo metropolitan area]], where population greatly changes between daytime and nighttime due to commute to big cities, especially to Tokyo. Its population growth rate declined in the mid-1990s, but recent apartment construction boom in the city has helped to increase the population growth rate again. The number of children continues to decrease in accordance with the declining number of births; in 2009 4,735 live births were recorded in the city, a marked decrease from the 1971 peak of 7,932 births. By contrast, the rate of people over the age of 65 is increasing, and stood at approximately 18.5% as of January 1, 2010, although this is still below the national average.<ref name="statistics 2010"/>

In June 2023, 41,471 people in Kawaguchi were not Japanese citizens; 23,637 people of them held Chinese citizenship.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/policies/statistics/toukei_ichiran_touroku.html | title=【在留外国人統計（旧登録外国人統計）統計表】 &#124; 出入国在留管理庁 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.e-stat.go.jp/stat-search/files?page=1&layout=datalist&toukei=00250012&tstat=000001018034&cycle=1&year=20230&month=12040606&tclass1=000001060399 | title=在留外国人統計（旧登録外国人統計） 在留外国人統計 月次 2023年6月 &#124; ファイル &#124; 統計データを探す }}</ref>

==History ==
[[File:100 views edo 020.jpg|thumb|An [[ukiyo-e]] [[woodblock print]] from the [[One Hundred Famous Views of Edo]] series by [[Utagawa Hiroshige]], depicting the crossing of the [[Arakawa River (Kantō)|Arakawa River]] at Zenkō-ji Temple (1857).]]
[[File:Honmachi,Kawaguchi.JPG|thumb|Honchō, Kawaguchi]]
After the last [[ice age]], during early and middle [[Jōmon period]], most of the area which is now Kawaguchi was under sea level except for the area which is now Omiya Tableland. Ancient peoples living in this area left several [[shell midden]]s, in which shells, [[Jōmon pottery]], and [[Pit-house|pit houses]] have been discovered by archaeologists. Many [[Kofun period]]  [[Tumulus|barrow]]s were also found in Kawaguchi, however many have also been destroyed by urban development. From the [[Heian period]] onwards, Kawaguchi was part of [[Musashi Province]]. The name "Kawaguchi" appears in the [[Kamakura period]] chronicle ''[[Gikeiki]]'', but it is not proven that this name designated current area of Kawaguchi.

During the [[Edo period]], Kawaguchi-juku developed as a [[shukuba|post station]] on the [[Nikkō Onari Kaidō]], a highway used by the Tokugawa shōgun and daimyō to visit [[Nikkō Tōshō-gū]]. Towards the [[Bakumatsu period]] and into the [[Meiji period]], the demand for metal products increased. Because of proximity to Tokyo and convenient water transportation using [[Arakawa River (Kanto)|Arakawa River]], Kawaguchi became the center of [[metal casting]] industry, for which it has remained famous until modern times.

The town of Kawaguchi was established within [[Kitaadachi District, Saitama]] on April 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. Kawaguchi was elevated to city status on April 1, 1933 by the merger of Kawaguchi with the neighboring villages of Aoki, Minami-Hirayanagi and Yokozone. The city expanded by annexing the town of [[Hatogaya, Saitama|Hatogaya]] and villages of Shiba, Kamine and Shingō in 1940. However, Hatogaya separated from Kawaguchi in 1948 in accordance with the results of a referendum.

Kawaguchi has experienced many disasters, including flood, earthquake and war. The Arakawa River has inundated Kawaguchi countless times and ruined agriculture, which resulted in famines. Also, the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]] damaged buildings in Kawaguchi, killing 99 people.

Currently, the population of Kawaguchi continues to increase, and many tall apartment buildings are being built around train stations. This is because many casting foundries moved to suburban [[industrial park]]s and the former sites were turned into residential areas.<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = Kawaguchi City Office | year = 1996 |trans-title = The short history of Kawaguchi |script-title=ja:川口市史縮小版}}</ref>

On April 1, 2001, Kawaguchi was designated a [[Special cities of Japan|special city]], with increased local autonomy.

On October 11, 2011, Kawaguchi re-absorbed the city of Hatogaya.

On August 16, 2018, the city of Kawaguchi and the City of [[Findlay, Ohio]] signed a "Friendship City Agreement".<ref>https://www.findlayohio.gov/community/about-findlay/friendship-city#ad-image-0 {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2024}}</ref> The city of Findlay houses seven Japanese businesses such as [[Bridgestone]], [[Hitachi |Hitachi Astemo]], [[Nissin Kogyo|Nissin Brake]], and more.

==Government==
Kawaguchi has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 42 members. Kawaguchi contributes seven members to the Saitama Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between [[Saitama 2nd district]] and  [[Saitama 15th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].
