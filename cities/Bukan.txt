==Etymology==
The origins of the name Bukan is controversial. While some believe it derives from the [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] word ''<nowiki/>'brides''', there is no evidence supporting this claim. In [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] the city's name is spelled "Bokan", and not Bukan.  Therefore, it doesn't match the [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] word for bride which is "Bûk". Bukan is only the Farsi variation of city's name and not the way the local Kurds spell or pronounce it. However, [[Rashid al-Din Hamadani]] wrote that the name was eponymous to a [[Merkit]] prince.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Minorsky|first=Vladimir|title=The Turks, Iran and the Caucasus in the Middle Ages|publisher=Variorum Reprints|year=1978|isbn=9780860780281|pages=68}}</ref> Only during the [[Qajar Iran|Qajar]] era is the name documented.<ref name=":0" />

== History ==
===Pre–Islamic era===
There have been several artefacts discovered in Bukan dating back to between 4100 BC and 4400 BC. These artefacts confirm that Bukan was home to one of the first human settlements on the [[Iranian Plateau]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.irancities.ir/showcity.aspx?code=65&code2=11|title=بوكان|date=September 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916061058/http://www.irancities.ir/showcity.aspx?code=65&code2=11|archive-date=2015-09-16}}</ref>

===Islamic era===
The city was part of the [[Mukriyan]] principality from the late 14th century to the 19th century. As the principality declined, aristocratic ([[Agha (title)|agha]]) Dehbokri Kurds, who controlled many surrounding villages, took control over the city. The Dehbokri were staunchly against the Mukriyan principality. Despite its small size, Bukan played a major role in the region culturally and politically. In the mid-1940s, the city was incorporated into the short-lived [[Republic of Mahabad]] and acquired a printing press and Kurdish books and magazines were published. Later, the town experienced a peasant revolt wherein the peasants succeeded in forcing the aristocrats out. The revolt was ultimately put down ruthlessly by the army.<ref name=":0" />

Up until the 1950s, Bukan was considered a large village but has seen a rapid growth since then.<ref name=":0" /> Its population increased from 5,307 in 1956, to 20,579 in 1976<ref name=":0" /> and 149,340 in 2006.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{IranCensus2006|04}}</ref>

The people of Bukan took part in the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979 and in the subsequent Kurdish movement for autonomy.<ref name=":0" /> It fell under the control of Kurdish opposition groups, but was recaptured by the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Army Ground Forces|Iranian Army]] on 1 January 1984. According to the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]], Bukan was the last Kurdish city in Iran to be captured.<ref>{{Cite web|date=September 16, 2015|title=Fars News Agency : بازسازی تمام عملیات‌‌های دفاع مقدس‌/ نقش خراسانی‌ها ‌در آزادسازی بوکان‌|url=http://www.farsnews.com/printable.php?nn=13910701001266|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916062004/http://www.farsnews.com/printable.php?nn=13910701001266|archive-date=2015-09-16}}</ref> On 15 April 1988, Bukan was bombarded by the [[Iraqi Air Force]], in which 19 people died and 160 were wounded.<ref>{{Cite web|date=April 10, 2016|title=برگزاری جلسه هماهنگی به منظور یادواره شهدای بمباران شهدای بوکان|url=http://ziryan.ir/NewsDetail.aspx?itemid=13653|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410021425/http://ziryan.ir/NewsDetail.aspx?itemid=13653|archive-date=2016-04-10}}</ref>

In 1247 Persian Date, Sardar [[Aziz Khan Mokri]] from the [[Sardasht County|Sardasht region]] built a castle near the great reservoir of Bukan that is presently named after its founder as Sardaar Aziz Khaan Castle. The castle was built on top of a hill 50 by 60 meters in diameter and 13 meters tall, and its main building material is 20 by 20&nbsp;cm bricks with clay mortar and timbers. The castle measures 25 by 30 meters and has 6 daises which rest upon 9-storey columns 2 meters tall and 1 meter in diameter.
