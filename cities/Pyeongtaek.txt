'''Pyeongtaek''' ({{Korean|hangul=평택}}; {{IPA|ko|ˈpʰjʌŋ.tʰɛk}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] in [[Gyeonggi]] Province, [[South Korea]]. Located in the southwestern part of the province, Pyeongtaek was founded as a union of two districts in 1940, during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty. It was elevated to city status in 1986 and is home to a South Korean naval base and a large concentration of [[United States]] troops. The South Korean government plans to transform Pyeongtaek city to an international economic hub to coincide with the move of the [[United States Forces Korea]] (USFK) to Pyeongtaek. During the [[Korean War]], it was the site of an early battle between U.S. and North Korean forces, the [[Battle of Pyongtaek]]. It is the location of [[Pyeongtaek University]].

==Military base==
The South Korean and United States governments came to an agreement{{when|date=October 2017}} to enlarge [[Camp Humphreys]]—a U.S. Army installation outside [[Anjeong-ri]], a community in Pyeongtaek—and move the majority of US forces stationed in and north of Seoul to the Camp Humphreys area. Invoking [[eminent domain]], the government obtained the surrounding land for the base expansion. This would result in the community's third displacement from their own land since the Japanese occupation during World War II.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6389553.stm|title=Eviction village: A farmer's tale|date=27 February 2007|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

The move originally included the headquarters of the [[ROK/US Combined Forces Command]], which has operational control of South Korean, U.S., and U.N. combined forces during wartime. In March 2007, ROK Minister of Defense Kim Jang-soo and [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert Gates]] agreed to dissolve the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command on April 17, 2012.<ref>[http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200703/200703070029.html Changes to Wartime OPCON: Challenges for the ROK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011203148/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200703/200703070029.html |date=2007-10-11 }}, Chosun</ref> This would allow ROK forces to have wartime control of its military during a military confrontation with the North. The ROK/US agreement allows USFK to move to one centralized location away from the congestion of Seoul and its surrounding areas. This relocation agreement results in returning two-thirds of the land currently used by the United States Military back to the South Korean government. By 2008, the U.S. military was to have consolidated 41 installations down to 10 due to the relocation agreement. USFK's only jail facility in South Korea is at Camp Humphreys.
 
[[Osan Air Base]] is in [[Songtan]], a district in Pyeongtaek City.
