The Tula Oblast area has been inhabited since the [[Stone Age]], as shown by the discoveries of burial mounds ([[kurgan]]s) and old settlements.<ref>For example, at the Satinskoye settlement site. {{Cite book|last=Yushkova |first=Maria A. |year=2012 |chapter=Northwestern Russia at the periphery of the north European and Volga-Uralic Bronze Age |editor1=Anfinset, Nils |editor2=Wrigglesworth, Melanie |title=Local Societies in Bronze Age Northern Europe |location=London  |publisher=Equinox ([[Acumen Publishing|Acumen]]) |pages=129–147 |isbn=978-1-84553-742-5}}</ref> By the eighth century, these lands were occupied by the [[Vyatichi]], an [[East Slavic people|East Slavic]] tribe who cultivated the land, traded, and worked at crafts, confirmed by records in property registers which mention an "ancient settlement" located at the [[confluence]] of the [[Upa River]] and Tulitsa River. The first mention of the city of [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] in 1146 is found in the [[Nikon Chronicle]], in reference to the campaign of Prince [[Svyatoslav Olgovich]] of [[Chernigov]]. At the time the lands belonged to the [[Ryazan Principality]], and Prince Sviatoslav passed through a number of settlements, including Tula, while heading for [[Ryazan]].<ref name="TulaRegion">{{Cite web|title=Tula Region |date=8 March 2004 |publisher= Kommersant Moscow |url=http://www.kommersant.com/p-73/r_417/Tula_Region/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930193332/http://www.kommersant.com/p-73/r_417/Tula_Region/ |archive-date=30 September 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>

==Politics==
[[Image:Cityhouse-tula.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Oblast administration building]]
During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Tula CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of Tula Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Tula Oblast Duma is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The Oblast Duma exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].

===Local government===
Representative bodies of urban and rural settlements and urban districts consist of deputies elected in municipal elections. The representative body of the municipal district consists of the heads of settlements that are part of the municipal district, and of deputies of the representative bodies of these settlements, elected by the representative bodies of the settlements from among their members in accordance with the same norm of representation, regardless of the population of the settlement. The term of office of representative bodies of cities, rural settlements, city districts, and municipal districts is 5 years, with some exceptions when the term is 3 years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Закон Тульской области от 10 июля 2014 года №2168-ЗТО О регулировании отдельных правоотношений, связанных с организацией и деятельностью органов местного самоуправления на территории Тульской области |trans-title=Law of the Tula Region of 10 July 2014 No. 2168-ZTO On the regulation of certain legal relations related to the organization and activities of local government bodies in the territory of the Tula Oblast |lang=ru |url=https://docs.cntd.ru/document/412381650 |website=Electronic fund of legal, regulatory and technical documents |access-date=2023-01-11 |archive-date=2023-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230116131624/https://docs.cntd.ru/document/412381650 |url-status=live}}</ref> Local government bodies in the Tula Oblast are headed by 103 heads of municipalities and 84 heads of municipal administrations.<ref name="Report">{{cite web |title=Отчет министерства внутренней политики и развития местного самоуправления в Тульской области по итогам работы за 2022 год |trans-title=Report of the Ministry of Internal Policy and Development of Local Self-Government in the Tula Region on the results of work for 2022 |url=https://mvp.tularegion.ru/activities/performance-reporting/ |website=Ministry of Internal Policy and Development of Local Self-Government in the Tula Oblast |date=2023-01-30}}</ref>
