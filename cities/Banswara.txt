{{More citations needed section|date=February 2021}}
{{Main|Banswara State}}
Banswara ("the bamboo city") was a [[Rajput]] [[princely state|feudatory state]] in [[Rajputana]] in [[British India]]. It borders [[Gujarat]] and was bounded on the north by the princely states of [[Dungarpur]] and [[Udaipur]] or [[Mewar]]; on the northeast and east by [[Pratapgarh district, Rajasthan|Partapgarh]]; on the south by the dominions of [[Indore State|Holkar]] and the state of [[Jhabua State|Jabua]] and on the west by the state of [[Rewa Kantha]].

Banswara state was about {{cvt|45|mi|km}} in length from north to south and {{cvt|33|mi|km}} in breadth from east to west and had an area of {{cvt|1606|mi2|km2}}.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Banswara|volume=3|page=355}}</ref> The population in 1941 was 258,760.<ref>{{cite web|title=Princely History of Banswara|url=http://princelystatesofindia.com/Princely/banswara.html|access-date=3 May 2012}}</ref>

Banswara district forms the eastern part of the region known as [[Vagad]] or Vagwar. The district was formerly a state ruled by the Maharavals, named for the [[bamboo]] found in abundance in its forests.

On 17 November 1913, [[Banswara district]] was witness to a little-known [[Mangarh Massacre|massacre]] of around 1500 tribals by the British, echoing the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]] in which 329 people were killed in the firing. British forces opened fire on tribals who had gathered in the Mangarh hills situated of the [[Aravalli Range|Aravali]] mountains on the Rajasthan-Gujarat border. The tribals were led by their leader [[Govindgiri|Govind Guru Banjara]] who inspired them to throw off the yoke of British rule. {{cn|date=March 2022}}

Govind Guru Banjara, influenced by social reformers like [[Dayananda Saraswati]], launched the "Bhagat" movement among the [[Bhil people|Bhils]], asking them to adhere to vegetarianism and abstain from all types of intoxicants. The movement slowly took on a political hue, and then turned into a movement against the oppressive policies of the British.{{cn|date=March 2022}}

The Bhils began opposing taxes imposed by the British and forced labour imposed by the princely states of Banswara, [[Santrampur]], [[Dungarpur]] and [[Kushalgarh]]. Worried by the tribal revolt, the British decided to crush the uprising. From October 1913, Govindguru Banjara asked his followers to gather at Mangarh hill from which they would conduct their operations. {{cn|date=March 2022}}

The British asked them to vacate Mangarh hill by 15 November but they refused. On 17 November, the tribals were gathering for a meeting when the British forces under Major S Bailey and Captain E Stiley opened fire on the crowd with cannons and guns. Though there are no official estimates, locals say about 2500 people were killed in cold blood.{{cn|date=March 2022}}

Govind guru Banjara was captured and exiled from the area. He was imprisoned in [[Hyderabad]] jail and released in 1919, on grounds of good behaviour. As he was exiled from his homeland, he settled in [[Limdi]] in [[Gujarat]], where he died in 1931. The site of the massacre is today known as [[Mangarh Dham]] and the locals are demanding that a national memorial be built there in memory of the martyrs.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rajputsamajbanswara.org/history-of-banswara|title=History of Banswara|date=22 September 2015}}</ref>
