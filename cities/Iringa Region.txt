==Geography==
The [[elevation]] of Iringa varies from 900 to 2,300 meters above sea level. A significant scarp that can reach 800 meters in height and is the eastern portion of the [[Great Rift Valley]] surrounds the area on all sides. Iringa is hence situated in Tanzania's southern highlands, bordering Mbeya, Njombe, Morogoro, Dodoma, and Singida areas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fsdt.or.tz/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Finscope_Iringa.pdf|title=Iringa's capital| year=2022| access-date=10 July 2022}}</ref>

The region is drained by the Little Ruaha and the [[Great Ruaha River|Great Ruaha]] rivers. The lake created by the [[Mtera Dam]] is the other significant water body here.<ref name=SEP>{{cite web|title=Iringa Region socio-economic profile, 2013|url=http://www.nbs.go.tz/nbs/takwimu/SocialEconomicProfiles/IringaRegionalProfile%202013.zip|date=2013|access-date=October 17, 2016|publisher=National Bureau of Statistics and Iringa Regional Secretariat|archive-date=October 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019211507/http://www.nbs.go.tz/nbs/takwimu/SocialEconomicProfiles/IringaRegionalProfile%202013.zip|url-status=live}}</ref>

The region can be divided into three zones - highland, midland and lowland. The highland zone is towards the east of the region. This area experiences a rainy season between November and May with annual precipitation ranging from {{convert|500|-|1500|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The period between June and September is cold and dry. The midland zone, in the central part of the region, lies at a height of {{convert|1200|-|1600|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level and faces between {{convert|600|-|1000|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain every year. Finally, the lowland zone, at a height of {{convert|900|-|1200|m|ft|abbr=on}} gets between {{convert|500|-|600|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain per annum.<ref name=SEP/>
