==History==

The [[Roman Republic|Romans]] built a military camp, which they called {{lang|la|[[Lousanna]]}}, at the site of a [[Celt]]ic settlement, near the lake where [[Vidy]] and [[Ouchy]] are situated; on the hill above was a fort called {{lang|la|Lausodunon}} or {{lang|la|Lousodunon}} (The "-y" suffix is common to many place names of Roman origin in the region (e.g.) [[Prilly]], [[Pully]], [[Lutry]], etc.).<ref name=HDS/> By the 2nd century AD, it was known as {{lang|la|vikanor[um] Lousonnensium}} and in 280 as {{lang|la|lacu Lausonio}}. By 400, it was {{lang|la|civitas Lausanna}}, and in 990 it was mentioned as {{lang|la|Losanna}}.<ref name=HDS/>

[[File:Saint François IMG 4837.jpg|thumb|{{lang|fr|Saint-François|italic=no}} Square, {{circa|1840}}]]
After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], insecurity forced the residents of Lausanne to move to its current centre, a hilly site that was easier to defend. The city which emerged from the camp was ruled by the [[County of Savoy|Counts of Savoy]] and the [[Bishop of Lausanne]].

From 888 to 1032, the initially relatively small town belonged to the kingdom of [[Upper Burgundy]]. During the 11th century, Lausanne developed into a political, economic and religious center. The city became the center of the secular rule of the bishops. In the period that followed, especially in the 12th and 13th centuries, Lausanne flourished. Finally, in 1275, the [[Lausanne Cathedral]] was consecrated in the presence of Pope Gregory X and [[Rudolf I of Germany|King Rudolf I of Germany]].

It was invaded by forces from the canton of [[Bern]] and remained under their domination from 1536 to 1798. The iconoclastic Bernese stripped the Lausanne cathedral of its Roman Catholic trappings, and a number of its cultural treasures, including the hanging tapestries in the cathedral, were permanently removed.<ref>They are preserved in the [[Bern Historical Museum]].</ref> Lausanne has made repeated requests to recover them, but they never were returned.

After the [[edict of Fontainebleau|revocation]] of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1685, Lausanne became (along with Geneva) a place of refuge for French [[Huguenot]]s. In 1729, a seminary was opened by [[Antoine Court]] and [[Benjamin Duplan]]. By 1750, 90 pastors had been sent back to France to work clandestinely; this number would rise to 400. Official persecution ended in 1787; a faculty of Protestant theology was established at [[Montauban]] in 1808, and the Lausanne seminary was finally closed on 18 April 1812.<ref>{{cite book |title=Le séminaire de Lausanne, 1726–1812 : instrument de la restauration du protestantisme français : étude historique fondée principalement sur les documents inédits |last=Lasserre |first=Claude |date=1997 |series=Bibliothèque historique vaudoise, no 112 |publisher=Bibliothèque historique vaudoise |location=Lausanne |isbn=978-2-88454-112-1 |oclc=39222660 |language=fr}} Also {{OCLC|39228676}}</ref> During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the city's status changed. In 1803, it became the capital of a newly formed Swiss [[canton of Vaud]] under which it joined the [[Swiss Federation]].<ref name=HDS/>

===Modern history and heritage===
In 1923, the city was the venue for the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne, which established the modern Turkish Republic.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Marabello |first1=Thomas Quinn |title=The Centennial of the Treaty of Lausanne: Turkey, Switzerland, the Great Powers and a Soviet Diplomat's Assassination |url=https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1949&context=sahs_review |website=Swiss American Historical Society |publisher=Swiss American Historical Society Review}}</ref> In 1964, the city played host to the Swiss National Exhibition,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.expo-archive.ch/eng/index.html?siteSect=1000 |title=Lausanne 1964: Two ideas, one Expo |work=Swiss National Exhibitions – Expo-Archive |publisher=[[swissinfo]]/[[SRG SSR idée suisse#SRI – Swissinfo / Swiss Radio International|Swiss Radio International (SRI)]] |access-date=27 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408100611/http://www.expo-archive.ch/eng/index.html?siteSect=1000 |archive-date=8 April 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> displaying its newly found confidence to play host to major international events.

From the 1950s to 1970s, a large number of Italians, [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] immigrated to Lausanne, settling mostly in the industrial suburb of [[Renens]].

The city has served as a refuge for European artists. While under the care of a psychiatrist at Lausanne, [[T. S. Eliot]] composed most of his 1922 poem ''[[The Waste Land]]'' ("by the waters of Leman I sat down and wept").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/The_Waste_Land#Words_at_Liberty |title=The Waste Land – Modernism Lab Essays |website=Modernism.research.yale.edu |date=24 March 2009 |access-date=18 January 2016}}</ref> [[Ernest Hemingway]] also visited from Paris with his wife during the 1920s, to holiday. In fact, many creative people – such as historian [[Edward Gibbon]] and Romantic era poets [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] and [[Lord Byron|Byron]] – have sojourned, lived, and worked in Lausanne or nearby.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unil.ch/files/live//sites/angl/files/shared/pdf/Hemingway/Hemingway.pdf |title=The Fourteenth International Hemingway Society Conference : Hemingway's Extreme Geographies |website=Unil.ch |access-date=18 January 2016}}</ref>

The city has been traditionally quiet, but in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a series of demonstrations took place that exposed tensions between young people and the police. In the early 1980s, the Lôzane Bouge protests demanded the city "open an autonomous centre, lower cinema ticket prices, liberalise cannabis and end the process of keeping records on homosexuals, all accompanied by leaflets, chants, and songs in the street".<ref>"Tired of being bored", ''The Lausanner'' 3 (English, Summer/Autumn 2019), 17. https://static.mycity.travel/manage/uploads/6/30/102741/1/the-lausanner-summer-autumn-2019-n0-3.pdf</ref> Protests occurred in 2003, against the [[G8]] meetings.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Anti-G8 protests turn violent in Switzerland |url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20030602/local/anti-g8-protests-turn-violent-in-switzerland.148814 |newspaper=Times of Malta |date=2 June 2003 |editor=[[Reuters]] |access-date=18 January 2016}}</ref>

In June 2022, Lausanne launched Plateforme 10, an art district comprising three museums. The trio of museums included Cantonal Museum of Fine Arts (MCBA), Photo Elysée, and the Museum of Contemporary Design and Applied Arts (MUDAC).<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-06-20 |title=A landmark arts venture launches in Lausanne, Switzerland |url=https://thespaces.com/plateform-10-lausanne-switzerland-art-gallery/ |access-date=2022-06-27 |website=The Spaces}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=One Swiss City Is Giving Its Art Scene a Major Boost |url=https://www.insidehook.com/daily_brief/art/lausanne-swiss-city-art-scene |access-date=2022-06-27 |website=InsideHook}}</ref>

==Geography==

===Topography===
[[File:Lausanne depuis le Mont Tendre.JPG|thumb|The agglomeration of Lausanne, [[Lake Geneva]] and the [[Alps]]]]The most important geographical feature of the area surrounding Lausanne is Lake Geneva (''Le Léman'' in French). Lausanne is built on the southern slope of the [[Swiss plateau]], with a difference in elevation of about {{convert|500|m|ft|0}} between the lakeshore at Ouchy and its northern edge bordering [[Le Mont-sur-Lausanne]] and [[Épalinges]]. Lausanne boasts a dramatic panorama over the lake and the Swiss and Savoyan [[Swiss Alps|Alps]].

In addition to its generally southward-sloping layout, the centre of the city is the site of an ancient river, the [[Le Flon (Lausanne)|Flon]], which has been covered since the 19th century. The former river forms a gorge running through the middle of the city south of the old city centre, generally following the course of the present ''Rue Centrale'', with several bridges crossing the depression to connect the adjacent neighbourhoods. Due to the considerable differences in elevation, tourists should make a note as to which plane of elevation they are on and where they want to go, otherwise they will find themselves tens of metres below or above the street in which they are trying to go. The name ''[[Lausanne-Flon station|Flon]]'' is also used for the [[Lausanne Metro|metro]] station located in the gorge.

The municipality includes the villages of [[Vidy]], Cour, [[Ouchy]], Mornex, Chailly, La Sallaz, Vennes, Montblesson, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Montheron and Chalet-à-Gobet ({{convert|871|m|ft|abbr=on}}) as well as the [[exclave]] of Vernand.

Lausanne is located at the limit between the extensive wine-growing regions of [[Lavaux]] (to the east) and [[la Côte]] (to the west).

Lausanne has an area, {{as of|2012-2014|lc=on}}, of {{convert|41.38|-|41.37|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} (depending on calculation method). Of this area, {{convert|6.22|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} or 15.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while {{convert|16.06|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} or 38.8% is forested. Of the rest of the land, {{convert|19.00|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} or 45.9% is settled (buildings or roads), {{convert|0.08|km2|acre|abbr=on}} or 0.2% is either rivers or lakes and {{convert|0.01|km2|acre|abbr=on}} or 0.0% is unproductive land.<ref name=BFS_land>[https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/raum-umwelt/bodennutzung-bedeckung/gesamtspektrum-regionalen-stufen/gemeinden.assetdetail.11007176.html Swiss Federal Statistical Office-Land Use Statistics] 2018 data {{in lang|de}} accessed 26 July 2020</ref>

Of the built-up area, industrial buildings made up 1.6% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 22.8% and transportation infrastructure made up 12.4%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 1.6% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 7.4%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 9.4% is used for growing crops and 4.9% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is in lakes and streams.<ref name=BFS_land/>

The municipality was part of the old [[Lausanne District]] until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and it became the capital of the new district of Lausanne.<ref name=Mutation>[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/infothek/nomenklaturen/blank/blank/gem_liste/02.html Nomenklaturen – Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151113231755/http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/infothek/nomenklaturen/blank/blank/gem_liste/02.html |date=13 November 2015 }}. {{in lang|de}} Retrieved 4 April 2011.</ref>

Lausanne has an average of 119.7 days of rain or snow per year and on average receives {{convert|1153|mm|in|abbr=on}} of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. The wettest month is May during which time Lausanne receives an average of {{convert|117|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of rain. During this month there is precipitation for an average of 12.1 days.

Lausanne is served by an extensive network of local, national and international public transport. National and international passenger trains of the [[Swiss Federal Railways]] depart from [[Lausanne railway station]], which is also the hub of the [[RER Vaud]] [[commuter rail]] system, and a stop on the city's [[Rapid transit|metro]]. The [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]] and local buses are operated by [[Transports publics de la région lausannoise]] (TL), with many routes run using [[trolleybus]]es. Additional commuter trains are run by the [[Lausanne–Echallens–Bercher railway]] (LEB) from [[Lausanne-Flon station]]. Ships across Lake Geneva are provided by the {{lang|fr|[[Compagnie Générale de Navigation sur le lac Léman]]}} (CGN).

Lausanne became the first city in Switzerland to have a [[rubber-tyred metro]] system, with the m2 Line which opened in October 2008. The rolling stock is a shorter version of the one used on [[Paris Métro Line 14]].<ref name="Bradt258">{{Cite book |title=Switzerland without a Car |publisher=[[Bradt Travel Guides]] |first=Anthony |last=Lambert |page=258 |isbn=978-1841624471 |date=2013 |edition=5}}</ref> Further expansion of the system is planned, as is the re-introduction of trams.<ref name="Axes forts">{{cite web |url=http://www.lausanne.ch/lausanne-en-bref/lausanne-demain/mobilite/axes-forts |title=Les Axes forts – Site officiel de la Ville de Lausanne |publisher=City of Lausanne |access-date=18 August 2014}}</ref>
