The modern name of the city can be traced back to the [[Roman Empire|Roman period]], when it was named ''Flavia Neapolis'' by Roman emperor [[Vespasian]] in 72 CE. During the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]], conflict between the city's [[Samaritans|Samaritan]] and newer [[Christians|Christian]] inhabitants peaked in the [[Samaritan revolts]] that were eventually suppressed by the Byzantines by 573, which greatly dwindled the Samaritan population of the city. Following the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant]] in the 7th century, the city was given its present-day Arabic name of ''Nablus''. After the [[First Crusade]], the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] drafted the laws of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] in the [[Council of Nablus]], and its Christian, Samaritan, and [[Muslims|Muslim]] inhabitants prospered. The city then came under the control of the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubids]] and the [[Mamluk Sultanate]]. Under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turk]]s, who [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–1517)|conquered the city in 1517]], Nablus served as the administrative and commercial centre for the surrounding area corresponding to the modern-day northern West Bank.

After the city was captured by [[British Empire|British]] forces during [[World War I]], Nablus was incorporated into [[Mandatory Palestine]] in 1922. The [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] saw the entire West Bank, including Nablus, [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|occupied and annexed]] by [[Jordan|Transjordan]]. Since the [[Six-Day War|1967 Arab–Israeli War]], the West Bank [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|has been occupied]] by [[Israel]]; since 1995, it has been governed by the PNA as part of [[Palestinian enclaves|Area A of the West Bank]]. Today, the population is predominantly Muslim, with small Christian and Samaritan minorities.

===Classical antiquity===
{{further|Samaritan Revolts|Samaria}}
[[File:Volusian Neapolis.jpg|thumb|right|Coin minted in Nablus (Neapolis), in the name of Emperor [[Volusian]], 251-253 CE]]
Flavia Neapolis ("new city of the emperor [[Flavius]]") was named in 72 CE by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] emperor [[Vespasian]] and applied to an older [[Samaritan]] village, variously called ''Mabartha'' ("the passage")<ref name=Negevp175>Negev and Gibson, 2005, p. 175.</ref> or ''Mamorpha''.<ref>(a) ὅθεν διὰ τῆς Σαμαρείτιδος καὶ παρὰ τὴν Νέαν πόλιν καλουμένην, Μαβαρθὰ δ᾽ ὑπὸ τῶν ἐπιχωρίων, καταβὰς εἰς Κορέαν, [[Josephus]], ''[[Bellum Judaicum]]'', 4:449 intus autem Samaria; oppida Neapolis, quod antea Mamortha dicebatur ‘the town are Naplous, formerly called Mamorpha.[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], [[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia Naturalis]], 5.69.</ref> Located between [[Mount Ebal]] and [[Mount Gerizim]], the new city lay {{convert|2|km|mi|sp=us}} west of the [[Bible|Biblical]] city of [[Shechem]] which was destroyed by the Romans that same year during the [[First Jewish–Roman War]].<ref name="STF">{{cite web |url=http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/discussion/035discuss.html |title=Neapolis – (Nablus) |access-date=2008-04-19 |date=19 December 2000 |publisher=Studium Biblicum Franciscanum – Jerusalem |archive-date=22 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122101623/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/discussion/035discuss.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="DNTA">{{cite web |url=http://www.dundee-nablus.org.uk/nablushistory.html |title=History of Nablus |access-date=2008-04-24 |publisher=Dundee–Nablus Twinning Association}}</ref> Holy places at the site of the city's founding include [[Joseph's Tomb]] and [[Jacob's Well]]. Because of the city's strategic geographic position and the abundance of water from nearby springs, Neapolis prospered, accumulating extensive territory, including the former [[Judea]]n [[toparchy]] of [[Aqraba, Nablus|Acraba]].<ref name="STF" />

Insofar as the hilly topography of the site would allow, the city was built on a Roman [[grid plan]] and settled with veterans who fought in the victorious legions and other foreign colonists.<ref name=Negevp175 /> In the 2nd century CE, Emperor [[Hadrian]] built a grand [[Roman theatre (structure)|theater]] in Neapolis that could seat up to 7,000 people.<ref name="Semplici" /> Coins found in Nablus dating to this period depict Roman military emblems and gods and goddesses of the Greek pantheon such as [[Zeus]], [[Artemis]], [[Serapis]], and [[Asklepios]].<ref name=Negevp175 /> Neapolis was entirely [[Paganism|pagan]] at this time.<ref name=Negevp175 /> [[Justin Martyr]] who was born in the city c. 100 CE, came into contact with [[Platonism]], but not with Christians there.<ref name=Negevp175 /> The city flourished until the civil war between [[Septimius Severus]] and [[Pescennius Niger]] in 198–9 CE. Having sided with Niger, who was defeated, the city was temporarily stripped of its legal privileges by Severus, who designated these to [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]] instead.<ref name=Negevp175 />

In 244 CE, [[Philip the Arab]] transformed Flavius Neapolis into a Roman colony named ''Julia Neapolis''. It retained this status until the rule of [[Trebonianus Gallus]] in 251 CE. The ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' speculates that Christianity was dominant in the 2nd or 3rd century, with some sources positing a later date of 480 CE.<ref name="OCHA" /> It is known for certain that a bishop from Nablus participated in the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] in 325 CE.<ref name=Negevp176>Negev and Gibson, 2005, p. 176.</ref> The presence of Samaritans in the city is attested to in literary and epigraphic evidence dating to the 4th century CE.<ref name=Negevp176 /> As yet, there is no evidence attesting to a Jewish presence in ancient Neapolis.<ref name=Negevp176 />

Si'on suggested that Neapolis was about 900 acres in size during the Byzantine period, making it three times larger than it was when it was first established as a Roman colony.<ref name="Si2001">שיאון, ע' (2001).

[[File:Ancient ruins in a Nablus neighborhood.JPG|thumb|right|Ruins from antiquity (foreground) in a residential area in Nablus, 2008]]

Conflict among the Christian population of Neapolis emerged in 451. By this time, Neapolis was within the [[Palaestina Prima]] province under the rule of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The tension was a result of [[Monophysitism|Monophysite]] Christian attempts to prevent the return of the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Juvenal of Jerusalem|Juvenal]], to his [[episcopal see]].<ref name="STF" /> However, the conflict did not grow into civil strife.

As tensions among the Christians of Neapolis decreased, tensions between the Christian community and the [[Samaritans]] grew dramatically. In 484, the city became the site of a deadly encounter between the two groups, provoked by rumors that the Christians intended to transfer the remains of [[Aaron]]'s sons and grandsons [[Eleazar]], [[Ithamar]] and [[Phinehas]]. Samaritans reacted by entering the cathedral of Neapolis, killing the Christians inside and severing the fingers of the bishop Terebinthus. Terebinthus then fled to [[Constantinople]], requesting an army garrison to prevent further attacks. As a result of the revolt, the Byzantine emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] erected a church dedicated to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] on Mount Gerizim. He also forbade the Samaritans to travel to the mountain to celebrate their religious ceremonies, and expropriated their synagogue there. These actions by the emperor fueled Samaritan anger towards the Christians further.<ref name="STF" />

Thus, the Samaritans rebelled again under the rule of emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]], reoccupying Mount Gerizim, which was subsequently reconquered by the Byzantine governor of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], Procopius. A third Samaritan revolt which took place under the leadership of [[Julianus ben Sabar]] in 529 was perhaps the most violent. Neapolis' bishop [[Ammonas]] was murdered and the city's priests were hacked into pieces and then burned together with the relics of [[saint]]s. The forces of Emperor [[Justinian I]] were sent in to quell the revolt, which ended with the slaughter of the majority of the Samaritan population in the city.<ref name="STF" />

Neapolis, along with most of Palestine, [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|was conquered by the Muslims]] under [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], a general of the [[Rashidun army]] of [[Umar|Umar ibn al-Khattab]], in 636 after the [[Battle of Yarmouk]].<ref name="STF"/><ref name="DNTA"/> The city's name was retained in its [[Arabic language|Arabicize]]d form, ''Nabulus''.

Under Muslim rule, Nablus contained a diverse population of Arabs and [[Persian people|Persian]]s, Muslims, Samaritans, Christians and [[Jew]]s.<ref name="STF" /> In the 9th century CE, [[Ya'qubi|Al-Yaqubi]] reported that Nablus had a mixed population of Arabs, [[Ajam]] (Non-Arabs), and Samaritans.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Levy-Rubin |first=Milka |date=2000 |title=New Evidence Relating to the Process of Islamization in Palestine in the Early Muslim Period: The Case of Samaria |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3632444 |journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=257–276 |doi=10.1163/156852000511303 |jstor=3632444 |issn=0022-4995}}</ref> In the 10th century, the Arab geographer [[al-Muqaddasi]], described it as abundant of olive trees, with a large marketplace, a finely paved [[Great Mosque of Nablus|Great Mosque]], houses built of stone, a stream running through the center of the city, and notable mills.<ref name="Muqaddasip55">Muqaddasi, [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028534265#page/n83/mode/2up/search/neapolis p. 55].</ref> He also noted that it was nicknamed "Little [[Damascus]]."<ref name="Semplici">Semplici, Andrea and Boccia, Mario.

===Ayyubid and Mamluk rule===
[[File:Interior view of Nasr Mosque.JPG|thumb|right|Interior view of the [[An-Nasr Mosque]], converted from a [[Crusades|Crusader]] church to a mosque in the 13th century]]
Crusader rule came to an end in 1187, when the [[Ayyubid]]s led by [[Saladin]] captured the city. According to a liturgical manuscript in [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Latin Christians]] fled Nablus, but the original [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christian inhabitants remained.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} Syrian geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] (1179–1229), wrote that Ayyubid Nablus was a "celebrated city in Filastin (Palestine)... having wide lands and a fine district." He also mentions the large Samaritan population in the city.<ref name="le Strange">Le Strange, 1890, pp. [https://archive.org/details/palestineundermo00lestuoft/page/511/mode/1up 511]–515</ref> After its recapture by the Muslims, the [[Great Mosque of Nablus]], which had become a church under Crusader rule, was restored as a mosque by the Ayyubids, who also built a [[mausoleum]] in the old city.<ref name="OCHA"/>

{{anchor|Battle of Nablus (1242)}}
In October 1242, Nablus was raided by the [[Knights Templar]]. This was the conclusion of the 1242 campaign season in which the Templars had joined forces with the Ayyubid emir of Kerak, [[An-Nasir Dawud]], against the Mamluks. The Templars raided Nablus in revenge for a previous massacre of Christians by their erstwhile ally An-Nasir Dawud. The attack is reported as a particularly bloody affair lasting for three days, during which the Mosque was burned and many residents of the city, Christians alongside Muslims, were killed or sold in the slave markets of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]].
The successful raid was widely publicized by the Templars in Europe; it is thought to be depicted in a late 13th-century fresco in the Templar church of [[San Bevignate]], [[Perugia]].<ref>{{cite book|page=169|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xifq5OE7174C&pg=PA169|title=Crusader Art in the Holy Land, From the Third Crusade to the Fall of Acre|first1=Jaroslav|last1=Folda|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn = 9780521835831}}.

In 1244, the Samaritan synagogue, built in 362 by the high priest Akbon and converted into a church by the Crusaders, was converted into [[al-Khadra Mosque]]. Two other Crusader churches became the [[An-Nasr Mosque]] and al-Masakim Mosque during that century.<ref name="STF"/><ref name="Andersonp72"/>

The [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk dynasty]] gained control of Nablus in 1260 and during their reign, they built numerous mosques and schools.<ref name="DNTA"/> Under Mamluk rule, Nablus possessed running water, many [[Turkish bath]]s and exported olive oil and [[Nabulsi soap|soap]] to [[Egypt]], Syria, the [[Hejaz]], several [[Mediterranean]] islands, and the [[Arabian Desert]]. The city's olive oil was also used in the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in Damascus. [[Ibn Battuta]], the Arab explorer, visited Nablus in 1355, and described it as a city "full of trees and streams and full of olives." He noted that the city grew and exported [[carob]] jam to [[Cairo]] and Damascus.<ref name="le Strange"/>

===Ottoman era===

Nablus came under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1517, along with the whole of Palestine. The Ottomans divided Palestine into six ''[[sanjak|sanjaqs]]'' ("districts"): [[Safad]], [[Jenin]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Gaza City|Gaza]], [[Ajlun]] and [[District of Nablus|Nablus]], all of which were part of [[Ottoman Syria]]. These five ''sanjaqs'' were subdistricts of the [[Vilayet of Damascus]]. Sanjaq Nablus was further subdivided into five ''[[nahiya]]'' (subdistricts), in addition to the city itself. The Ottomans did not attempt to restructure the political configuration of the region on the local level such that the borders of the ''nahiya'' were drawn to coincide with the historic strongholds of certain families. Nablus was only one among a number of local centers of power within Jabal Nablus, and its relations with the surrounding villages, such as [[Beita, Nablus|Beita]] and [[Aqraba, Nablus|Aqraba]], were partially mediated by the rural-based chiefs of the ''nahiya''.<ref name="Doumani3">Doumani, 1995, Chapter: "The 1657 Campaign."</ref> During the 16th century, the population was predominantly Muslim, with Jewish, Samaritan and Christian minorities.<ref name="STF" /><ref>B. Lewis, Studies in the Ottoman Archives—I, ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', University of London, Vol. 16, No. 3 (1954), 469–501.</ref><ref name="Hutteroth" />

After decades of upheavals and rebellions mounted by Arab tribes in the Middle East, the Ottomans attempted to reassert centralized control over the Arab ''vilayets''. In 1657, they sent an expeditionary force led mostly by Arab ''[[sipahi]]'' officers from central [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]] to reassert Ottoman authority in Nablus and its hinterland, as part of a broader attempt to established centralized rule throughout the empire at that time. In return for their services, the officers were granted agricultural lands around the villages of Jabal Nablus. The Ottomans, fearing that the new Arab land holders would establish independent bases of power, dispersed the land plots to separate and distant locations within Jabal Nablus to avoid creating contiguous territory controlled by individual clans. Contrary to its centralization purpose, the 1657 campaign allowed the Arab ''sipahi'' officers to establish their own increasingly autonomous foothold in Nablus. The officers raised their families there and intermarried with the local notables of the area, namely the [[ulama]] and merchant families. Without abandoning their nominal military service, they acquired diverse properties to consolidate their presence and income such as soap and pottery factories, [[Turkish bath|bathhouses]], agricultural lands, grain mills and, olive and sesame oil presses.<ref name="Doumani3" />

The most influential military family were the Nimrs, who were originally local governors of [[Homs]] and [[Hama]]'s rural subdistricts. Other officer families included the Akhrami, Asqalan, Bayram, Jawhari, Khammash, Mir'i, Shafi, Sultan and Tamimi families, some of which remained in active service, while some left service for other pursuits. In the years following the 1657 campaign, two other families migrated to Nablus: the Jarrars from [[Balqa (region)|Balqa]] and the [[Tuqan family|Tuqans]] from northern Syria or Transjordan. The Jarrars came to dominate the hinterland of Nablus, while the Tuqans and Nimrs competed for influence in the town. The former held the post of ''[[mutasallim]]'' (tax collector, strongman) of Nablus longer, though non-consecutively than any other family. The three families maintained their power until the mid-19th century.<ref name="Doumani3" />

In the mid-18th century, [[Zahir al-Umar]], the autonomous Arab ruler of the [[Galilee]] became a dominant figure in Palestine. To build up his army, he strove to gain a monopoly over the [[cotton]] and olive oil trade of the [[southern Levant]], including Jabal Nablus, which was a major producer of both crops. In 1771, during the [[Ali Bey al-Kabir|Egyptian Mamluk]] invasion of Syria, Zahir aligned himself with the Mamluks and besieged Nablus, but did not succeed in taking the city. In 1773, he tried again without success. Nevertheless, from a political perspective, the sieges led to a decline in the importance of the city in favor of Acre. Zahir's successor, [[Jezzar Pasha]], maintained Acre's dominance over Nablus. After his reign ended in 1804, Nablus regained its autonomy, and the Tuqans, who represented a principal opposing force, rose to power.<ref name="Doumani4" />

===Egyptian rule and Ottoman revival===
[[File:Nablus 1898.jpg|thumb|right|Nablus in 1898]]

In 1831–32 [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty|Khedivate Egypt]], then led by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], conquered Palestine from the Ottomans. A policy of [[conscription]] and new [[taxation]] was instituted which led to a [[Peasants' Revolt of 1834 (Palestine)|revolt]] organized by the ''[[Palestinian nationalism#Notables|a'ayan]]'' (notables) of Nablus, [[Hebron]] and the Jerusalem-Jaffa area. In May 1834, [[Qasim al-Ahmad]]—the chief of the [[Jamma'in]] ''nahiya''—rallied the rural sheikhs and ''[[fellahin]]'' (peasants) of Jabal Nablus and launched a revolt against Governor [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], in protest at conscription orders, among other new policies. The leaders of Nablus and its hinterland sent thousands of rebels to attack Jerusalem, the center of government authority in Palestine, aided by the [[Abu Ghosh]] clan, and they conquered the city on 31 May. However, they were later defeated by Ibrahim Pasha's forces the next month. Ibrahim then forced the heads of the Jabal Nablus clans to leave for nearby villages. By the end of August, the countrywide revolt had been suppressed and Qasim was executed.<ref name="Doumani4">Doumani, 1995, Chapter: "Egyptian rule, 1831–1840."</ref>

Egyptian rule in Palestine resulted in the destruction of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and thus, the political importance of Nablus was further elevated. The Ottomans wrested back control of Palestine from [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]] in 1840–41. However, the [[Arraba, Jenin|Arraba]]-based Abd al-Hadi clan which rose to prominence under Egyptian rule for supporting Ibrahim Pasha, continued its political dominance in Jabal Nablus.<ref name="Doumani4" />

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Nablus was the principal trade and manufacturing center in Ottoman Syria. Its economic activity and regional leadership position surpassed that of Jerusalem and the coastal cities of [[Jaffa]] and Acre. [[Olive oil]] was the primary product of Nablus and aided other related industries such as [[Nabulsi soap|soap-making]] and basket weaving.<ref name="Doumani" /> It was also the largest producer of cotton in the Levant, topping the production of northern cities such as Damascus.<ref name="Doumani5" /> Jabal Nablus enjoyed a greater degree of [[autonomy]] than other ''sanjaqs'' under Ottoman control, probably because the city was the capital of a hilly region, in which there were no "foreigners" who held any military or bureaucratic posts. Thus, Nablus remained outside the direct "supervision" of the Ottoman government, according to historian [[Beshara Doumani]].<ref name="Doumani">Doumani, 1995, Chapter: "Introduction."</ref>

===World War I and British Mandate===
[[File:Nablus 1918.jpg|thumb|right|Nablus in 1918]]
Between 19 September and 25 September 1918, in the last months of the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] of the First World War the Battle of Nablus took place, together with the [[Battle of Sharon]] during the set piece [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]]. Fighting took place in the [[Judean Hills]] where the [[British Empire]]'s [[XX Corps (United Kingdom)|XX Corps]] and [[Royal Flying Corps]] attacked the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Yildirim Army Group]]'s [[Seventh Army (Ottoman Empire)|Seventh Army]] which held a defensive position in front of Nablus, and which the [[Eighth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Eighth Army]] had attempted to retreat to, in vain.<ref>Richard P.

The [[1927 Jericho earthquake]] destroyed many of the Nablus' historic buildings, including the An-Nasr Mosque.<ref>Damage Caused By Landslides During the Earthquakes of 1837 and 1927 in the Galilee Region, By D.

===Jordanian period===
During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], Nablus came under [[Jordan]]ian control. Thousands of [[Palestinian refugees]] fleeing from areas captured by [[Israel]]i forces arrived in Nablus, settling in refugee camps in and around the city. Its population doubled, and the influx of refugees put a heavy strain on the city's resources. Three such camps still located within the city limits today are [[Ein Beit al-Ma']], [[Balata Camp|Balata]] and [[Askar (camp)|Askar]]. During the Jordanian period, the adjacent villages of [[Rafidia]], [[Balata al-Balad]], al-Juneid and Askar were annexed to the Nablus municipality.<ref>Abujidi, 2014, p. 96.</ref> Nablus was [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|annexed by Jordan]] in 1950.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cavendish |first=Richard |url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/jordan-formally-annexes-west-bank  |title=Jordan Formally Annexes the West Bank |work=History Today |date=4 April 2000 |access-date=7 June 2020 <!-- alternate url (paywalled): https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61692149.html --> }}</ref>

===Israeli period===
[[File:2018 OCHA OpT map Nablus.jpg|thumb|2018 [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|United Nations]] map of the area, showing the [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|Israeli occupation]] arrangements.]]
The 1967 [[Six-Day War]] ended in the [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|Israeli occupation]] of Nablus. Many [[Israeli settlement]]s were built around Nablus during the 1980s and early 1990s. The restrictions placed on Nablus during the First Intifada were met by a back-to-the-land movement to secure self-sufficiency, and had a notable outcome in boosting local agricultural production.<ref name="Robinson"/>

In 1976, [[Bassam Shakaa]] was elected mayor. On 2 June 1980, he survived an assassination attempt by the [[Jewish Underground]], considered a terrorist group by Israel, which resulted in Shakaa losing both his legs. In the spring of 1982, the Israeli administration removed him from office and installed an army officer who ran the city for the following three and a half years.<ref name="Publishers p. 6">Middle East International No 270, 7 March 1986, Publishers [[Christopher Mayhew|Lord Mayhew]], [[Dennis Walters]]. [[Daoud Kuttab]] p. 6</ref>

On 29 July 1985, the Israeli army imposed a 5-day curfew on the city. At the time this was the longest curfew ever imposed on a Palestinian community in the [[West Bank]]. It was lifted 2 hours each day to allow residents to find food. The curfew was in response to the murder of two teachers on 21 July near [[Jenin]] and the killing of an Israeli para-military on 30 July. [[an-Najah University|Najah University]] was closed for 2 months after posters with pictures of [[PLO]] leader were found.<ref>Middle East International No 256, 9 August 1985,Publishers [[Christopher Mayhew|Lord Mayhew]], [[Dennis Walters|Dennis Walters MP]]; [[Daoud Kuttab]] pp. 4,5</ref>

In January 1986, the Israeli administration ended with the appointment of [[Zafer al-Masri]] as mayor. A popular leader of the Nablus Chamber of Commerce al-Masri began a program of improvements in the town. Despite maintaining that he would have nothing to do with Israeli autonomy plans he was assassinated on 2 March 1986.<ref name="Publishers p. 6"/> The assassination was widely believed to be the work of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]].

On 18 June 1989 Salah el Bah'sh, aged 17, was shot dead by an [[Israeli army|Israeli soldier]] whilst walking through the Nablus [[Nablus#Old City|Casbah]]. Witnesses told [[B'Tselem]], the Israeli Human Rights group, that he was shot in the chest at close range after not responding to a soldier shouting "Ta'amod" (Halt!). The army indicated that an investigation was being carried out. B'Tselem understood that the victim was killed by a [[rubber bullet]].<ref>B'Tselem information sheet July 1989. p.9.

===Palestinian control===

From the start of the [[Second Intifada]], which began in September 2000, Nablus became a flash-point of clashes between the IDF and Palestinians.

===Old City===
{{main|Old City of Nablus}}
{{See also|Levantine archaeology#Nablus}}In the center of Nablus lies the old city, composed of six major quarters: Yasmina, Gharb, Qaryun, Aqaba, Qaysariyya, and Habala. Habala is the largest quarter and its population growth led to the development of two smaller neighborhoods: al-Arda and Tal al-Kreim. The old city is densely populated and prominent families include the Nimrs, Tuqans, and Abd al-Hadis. The large fortress-like compound of the [[Abd al-Hadi Palace]] built in the 19th century is located in Qaryun. The [[Al-Nimr Palace|Nimr Hall]] and the [[Tuqan Palace]] are located in the center of the old city. There are several [[mosque]]s in the Old City: the [[Great Mosque of Nablus]], An-Nasr Mosque, al-Tina Mosque, [[al-Khadra Mosque]], [[Hanbali Mosque]], al-Anbia Mosque, Ajaj Mosque and others.<ref name="Semplici-a">Semplici, Andrea and Boccia, Mario.

===Religion===
In 891 CE, during the early centuries of [[Islam]]ic rule, Nablus had a religiously diverse population of Samaritans, [[Muslim]]s and Christians. Arab geographer [[Shams al-Din al-Ansari al-Dimashqi|Al-Dimashqi]], recorded that under the rule of the Mamluk Dynasty (Muslim Dynasty based in Egypt), local Muslims, Samaritans, Orthodox Christians, Catholics and Jews populated the city.<ref name="le Strange"/> At the [[1931 census of Palestine|1931 census]], the population was counted as 16,483 Muslims, 533 Christians, 6 Jews, 7 Druses and 160 Samaritans.<ref name="Census1931"/>  However, this census was taken after the [[1929 Palestine riots]] which drove the Jews out of many majority-Arab cities.<ref>Great Britain, 1930: Report of the Commission on the disturbances of August 1929, Command paper 3530 (Shaw Commission report), p. 65.</ref>

The majority of the inhabitants today are Muslim, but there are small [[Palestinian Christian|Christian]] and [[Samaritan]] communities as well. Much of the local [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] Muslim population of Nablus is believed to be descended from Samaritans who converted to Islam. Certain Nabulsi family names are associated with Samaritan ancestry – Muslimani, Yaish, and Shakshir among others.<ref>[http://www.zajel.org/article_view.asp?newsID=4425&cat=18 The Political History of the Samaritans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119035811/http://www.zajel.org/article_view.asp?newsID=4425&cat=18 |date=2012-01-19 }}</ref> According to the historian Fayyad Altif, large numbers of Samaritans converted because of persecution and because the monotheistic nature of Islam made it easy for them to accept it.<ref name=Ireton>{{cite web|title=The Samaritans – A Jewish Sect in Israel: Strategies for Survival of an Ethno-religious Minority in the Twenty First Century|author=Sean Ireton|publisher=Anthrobase|year=2003|access-date=2007-11-29|url=http://www.anthrobase.com/Txt/I/Ireton_S_01.htm}}</ref>

In 1967, there were about 3,500 Christians of various denominations in Nablus, but that figure dwindled to about 650 in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrmea.com/archives/Jan_Feb_2008/0801050.html |title="We Need Justice", Says Father Yousef Sa'adah, a Melkite Priest in Nablus |access-date=2008-04-24 |last=Corillet |first=Joel |date=February 2008 |work=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs}}</ref> Of the Christian populace, there are seventy [[Orthodoxy#Christianity|Orthodox Christian]] families, about thirty Catholic (Roman Catholic and Eastern Melkite Catholic) families and thirty [[Anglican]] families.

There are seventeen Islamic monuments and eleven mosques in the Old City.<ref name="OCHA"/><ref name=NW/> Nine of the mosques were established before the 15th century.<ref name="OCHA"/> In addition to Muslim houses of worship, Nablus contains an Orthodox church dedicated to Saint Justin Martyr,<ref name="Semplici"/> built in 1898, and the ancient Samaritan synagogue, which is still in use.<ref name=NW>[http://www.nablus.org/nablus/maps.htm Places in Nablus]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Nablus Website.</ref>

==Economy==

Beginning in the early 16th century, trade networks connecting Nablus to [[Damascus]] and [[Cairo]] were supplemented by the establishment of trading posts in the [[Hejaz]] and [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf]] regions to the south and east, as well as in the [[Anatolian Peninsula]] and the [[Mediterranean]] islands of [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]]. Nablus also developed trade relations with [[Aleppo]], [[Mosul]], and [[Baghdad]].<ref name="Doumani2">Doumani, 1995, Chapter: "The City of Nablus."</ref> The Ottoman government ensured adequate safety and funding for the annual [[hajj|pilgrimage]] caravan (''qafilat al-hajj'') from [[Damascus]] to the Islamic holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. This policy benefited Nablus economically. Pilgrimage caravans became the key factor in the fiscal and political relationship between Nablus and the central government. For a brief period in the early 17th century, the governor of Nablus, [[Farrukh Pasha]], was appointed leader of the pilgrimage caravan (''[[amir al-hajj]]''), and he constructed a large commercial compound in Nablus for that purpose.<ref name="Doumani2" />

In 1882, there were 32 soap factories and 400 [[loom]]s exporting their products throughout the Middle East.<ref name="Semplici" /><ref name="IO">{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/english/In_Depth/PalestineInFocus/Thepeople/former/1967/WestBank/04.shtml |title="Little Damascus": Nablus City, West Bank |access-date=2008-04-24 |publisher=Islam Online |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413023559/http://www.islamonline.net/English/In_Depth/PalestineInFocus/Thepeople/former/1967/WestBank/04.shtml <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archive-date=2008-04-13}}</ref> Nablus exported three-fourths of its soap — the city's most important commodity—to Cairo by caravan through [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and the [[Sinai Peninsula]], and by sea through the ports of [[Jaffa]] and Gaza. From Egypt, and particularly from Cairo and [[Damietta]], Nablus merchants imported mainly rice, [[sugar]], and spices, as well as linen, cotton, and wool textiles. Cotton, soap, olive oil, and textiles were exported by Nablus merchants to Damascus, whence silks, high-quality textiles, copper, and a number luxury items, such as jewellery were imported.<ref name="Doumani2" /> With regard to the local economy, agriculture was the major component. Outside of the city limits, there were extensive fields of [[olive]] groves, [[ficus|fig]] and [[pomegranate]] orchards and [[grape]] vineyards that covered the area's slopes. Crops, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, melons and ''[[mulukhiyya]]'' were grown in the fields, vegetable gardens, and grain mills scattered across central [[Samaria]].<ref name="Doumani2" /> Nablus was also the largest producer of [[cotton]] in the Levant, producing over {{convert|225000|kg|0|abbr=on}} of the product by 1837.<ref name="Doumani5">Doumani, 1995, Chapter: "Cotton Production in Jabal Nablus."</ref>[[File:Placa dels màrtirs Nablus.jpg|thumb|Downtown Nablus, Martyrs Square|left]]

[[File:سوق في نابلس.jpg|thumb|One of the old markets in Nablus]]
The Al-Arz ice-cream company is the largest of six ice-cream manufacturers in the Palestinian territories. The Nablus business developed from an ice-factory set up by Mohammad Anabtawi in the town centre in 1950. It produces 50 tons a day, and exports to Jordan and Iraq.

Before 2000, 13.4% of Nablus' residents worked in Israel, with the figure dropping to 4.7% in 2004. The city's manufacturing sector made up 15.7% of the economy in 2004, a drop from 21% in 2000. Since 2000, most of the workforce has been employed in agriculture and local trade.<ref name="OCHA"/> In the wake of the Intifada, unemployment rates rose from 14.2% in 1997 to 60% in 2004. According to an [[OCHA]] report in 2008, one of the reasons for the high unemployment was a ring of checkpoints around the city,<ref name="ocha1">{{cite web |url=http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/opt/OCHA_Body-ASP_Files/Coordination_Sec/OCHA-oPt_FCU_BIOs_PDFs/OCHA-oPt_Nablus-FCU_Bio_Data-22Nov04.pdf |title=Bio Data – Nablus |access-date=2008-04-24 |publisher=United Nation Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409050228/http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/opt/OCHA_Body-ASP_Files/Coordination_Sec/OCHA-oPt_FCU_BIOs_PDFs/OCHA-oPt_Nablus-FCU_Bio_Data-22Nov04.pdf |archive-date=2008-04-09 }}</ref> leading to the relocation of many businesses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/Commercial%20Crossings%20V5.pdf |title=Increasing Need, Decreasing Access: Tightening Control On Economic Movement |access-date=2014-05-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314071422/http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/commercial%20crossings%20v5.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-14 }}</ref>

''Nabulsi'', meaning "from Nablus", is used to describe items such as [[Palestinian handicrafts|handicrafts]] (e.g. [[Nabulsi soap]]) and food products (e.g. [[Nabulsi cheese]]) that are made in Nablus or in the traditional Nablus style.

===Traditional costume===
{{Main|Palestinian costumes}}
Nablus costume was of a distinctive style that employed colorful combinations of various fabrics. Because of its position as important trade center with a flourishing ''[[souk]]'' ("market"), in the late 19th century, there was a large choice of fabrics available in the city, from [[Damascus]] and [[Aleppo]] [[silk]] to [[Manchester]] [[cotton]]s and [[Calico (fabric)|calico]]s. Similar in construction to the garments worn in the [[Galilee]], both long and short [[Turkish culture|Turkish style]] jackets were worn over the {{transl|ar|thob}} ("robe"). For daily wear, {{transl|ar|thobs}} were often made of white cotton or [[linen]], with a preference for winged sleeves. In the summer, costumes often incorporated interwoven striped bands of red, green and yellow on the front and back, with appliqué and braidwork popularly decorating the ''qabbeh'' ("square chest piece").<ref name=PCA2>{{cite web |title=Palestine costume before 1948: by region |publisher=Palestine Costume Archive |access-date=2008-08-01 |url=http://www.palestinecostumearchive.org/regional.htm|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020913101705/http%3A//www%2Epalestinecostumearchive%2Eorg/regional%2Ehtm |archive-date= September 13, 2002 }}</ref>

===Cuisine===
[[File:Kinafa.jpg|right|thumb|A ''siniyyeh'' of [[Kanafeh]] ]]
Nablus is one of the Palestinian cities that sustained elite classes, fostering the development of a culture of "high cuisine", such as that of [[Damascus]] or [[Baghdad]]. The city is home to a number of food products well known throughout the Levant, the [[Arab world]] and the former [[provinces of the Ottoman Empire]].

''[[Kanafeh]]'' (or Kunafa) is the best known ''Nabulsi'' sweet.<ref name="NS" /> It is made of several fine shreds of pastry noodles with honey-sweetened cheese in the center. The top layer of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Now made throughout the Middle East, ''kanafeh Nabulsi'' uses a white-brine cheese called ''[[Nabulsi cheese|jibneh Nabulsi]]''. Boiled sugar is used as a syrup for ''kanafeh''.

Other sweets made in Nablus include ''[[baklawa]]'', "Tamriya", ''mabrumeh'' and ''ghuraybeh'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atlastours.net/holyland/nablus.html |title=Nablus, Holy Land |access-date=2008-04-24 |publisher=Atlas Travel and Tourist Agency}}</ref> a plain pastry made of butter, flour and sugar in an "S"-shape, or shaped as fingers or bracelets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nablusculture.ps/nablus,sweets.htm |title=Nabulsi Sweets |access-date=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus the Culture |archive-date=4 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070245/http://nablusculture.ps/nablus,sweets.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Prior to the 1860s, in the summertime, the barilla would be placed in towering stacks, burned, and then the ashes and coals would be gathered into sacks, and transported to Nablus from the area of modern-day [[Jordan]] in large [[Camel train|caravans]]. In the city, the ashes and coals were pounded into a fine natural [[alkaline]] soda powder called {{transl|ar|qilw}}.<ref name=SEMP/> Today, {{transl|ar|qilw}} is still used in combination with lime.

==Local government==
The city of Nablus is the ''muhfaza'' (seat) of the [[Nablus Governorate]], and is governed by a municipal council made up of fifteen elected members, including the mayor.<ref name="NMMC">{{cite web|url=http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/aboutus/municipal_council.htm |title=Nablus Municipal Council |access-date=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

The two primary political parties in the municipal council are [[Hamas]] and [[Fatah]]. In the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections, the Reform and Change list representing the Hamas faction won 73.4% of the vote, gaining the majority of the municipal seats (13). Palestine Tomorrow, representing Fatah, gained the remaining two seats with 13.0% of the vote. Other political parties, such as the [[Palestinian People's Party]] and the [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] failed to gain any seats in the council, though they each received over 1,000 votes.<ref name="Results">{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.ps/admin/pdf/Municipal_Elections_Results_EN_(4).pdf |title=2005 Palestinian Local Elections, round 4 |access-date=2010-08-21 |publisher=Higher Commission for Local Elections }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Yaish's four-year term legally expired in December 2009. While elections in the West Bank were scheduled for 17 July 2010, they were canceled because of Fatah's lack of agreement on list of candidates. Nablus was one of the most important municipalities where Fatah failed to resolve internal conflicts that resulted in two competing Fatah lists: one headed by former mayor [[Ghassan Shakaa]] and one headed by Amin Makboul.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&categ_id=5&article_id=117616#axzz0xEaOeWPj |title=A Palestinian election is aborted, again |publisher=Daily Star |access-date=2010-08-21 }}</ref>

In the October 2012 municipal elections, Hamas boycotted the polls, protesting the holding of elections while reconciliation efforts with Fatah were at a standstill. Former mayor Ghassan Shakaa, a former local Fatah leader, won the vote as an independent against Fatah member Amin Makboul and another independent candidate.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Lynfield |title=Hamas election boycott leaves West Bank Palestinians with only one choice |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2012/1006/Hamas-election-boycott-leaves-West-Bank-Palestinians-with-only-one-choice |publisher=The Christian Science Monitor |date=2012-10-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Danny |last=Whatmough |url=http://nablus.dannywhatmough.com/2012/10/21/west-bank-elections-demonstrate-extent-of-political-divide/ |title=West Bank elections demonstrate extent of political divide |date=2012-10-21 |access-date=25 March 2014 |archive-date=25 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325052749/http://nablus.dannywhatmough.com/2012/10/21/west-bank-elections-demonstrate-extent-of-political-divide/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1997, 99.7% of Nablus' 18,003 households were connected to electricity through a public network. Prior to its establishment in 1957, electricity came from private generators. Today, the majority of the inhabitants of 18 nearby towns, in addition to the city's inhabitants, are connected to the Nablus network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nablus.org/en/content.php?id_itemcontent=245 |title=Electricity Department Statistics |access-date=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725051139/http://www.nablus.org/en/content.php?id_itemcontent=245 |archive-date=2009-07-25 }}</ref>

===Fire department===
Nablus is one of the few cities in the West Bank to have a fire department, which was founded in 1958. At that time, the "fire brigade" (as it was called) was composed of five members and one extinguishing vehicle. In 2007, the department had seventy members and over twenty vehicles. Until 1986, it was responsible for all of the northern West Bank, but today it only covers the Nablus and [[Tubas Governorate]]s. From 1997 to 2006, Nablus' fire department extinguished 15,346 fires.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nablus.org/en/content.php?id_itemcontent=256&id_csub=279 |title=Fire Brigade |access-date=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728173315/http://www.nablus.org/en/content.php?id_itemcontent=256&id_csub=279 |archive-date=2009-07-28 }}</ref>

==Transportation==
In the early 20th century, Nablus was the southernmost station of a spur from the [[Jezreel Valley railway]]'s [[Afula]] station, itself a spur from the [[Hejaz railway]]. The extension of the railway to Nablus was built in 1911–12.<ref>[http://nabataea.net/hejazbk3.html The Hejaz Railroad] Nabataea.</ref> During the beginning of the British Mandate, one weekly train was operated from Haifa to Nablus via Afula and [[Jenin]]. The railway was destroyed during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], and the route of the line was bisected by the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]].

The main [[Highway 60 (Israel–Palestine)|Beersheba–Nazareth road]] running through the middle of the West Bank ends in Nablus, although the thoroughfare of local Arabs is severely restricted. The city was connected to [[Tulkarm]], [[Qalqilya]] and [[Jenin]] by roads which are now blocked by the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]]. From 2000 until 2011, Israel maintained [[Israel Defense Forces checkpoint|checkpoint]]s such as [[Huwwara checkpoint]] which effectively cut off the city, severely curtailing social and economic travel.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4027584,00.html |title=Palestinians: More barriers to be removed |newspaper=Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=1995-06-20 |access-date=2014-05-12|last1=Altman |first1=Yair }}</ref> From January 2002, buses, taxis, trucks and private citizens required a permit from the Israeli military authorities to leave and enter Nablus.<ref name="OCHA"/> Since 2011, there has been a relaxation of travel restrictions and the dismantlement of some checkpoints.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/idf-to-remove-major-west-bank-checkpoint-to-enable-palestinian-movement-1.342612 IDF to remove major West Bank checkpoint to enable Palestinian movement].

The nearest airport is the [[Ben Gurion International Airport]] in [[Lod]], [[Israel]], but because of restrictions governing the entry of [[Palestinians]] to Israel, and their lack of access to foreign Embassies to get travel visas, many residents must travel to [[Amman]], [[Jordan]] to use the [[Queen Alia International Airport]], which requires passage through a number of checkpoints and the Jordanian border. Taxis are the main form of public transportation within Nablus and the city contains 28 taxi offices and garages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/guide/Taxi.htm |title=Taxi offices |access-date=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080217044118/http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/guide/Taxi.htm |archive-date = February 17, 2008}}</ref>
