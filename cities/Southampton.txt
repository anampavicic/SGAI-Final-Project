Southampton was heavily bombed during the [[Second World War]] during what was known as the [[Southampton Blitz]]. It was one of the major embarkation points for [[D-Day]]. In the [[Middle Ages]] Southampton was where troops left England for the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. It was itself raided by French pirates, leading to the construction of the fortified [[Southampton town walls|town walls]], many of which still stand today. [[Jane Austen]] also lived in Southampton for a number of years. In 1964, the town of Southampton acquired [[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]], becoming the City of Southampton.<ref name=Rance/>

==History==
{{Main|History of Southampton|Timeline of Southampton}}

===Pre-Norman===
Archaeological finds suggest that the area has been inhabited since the [[Stone Age]].<ref name=MusArch>Southampton Museum of Archeology. God's House Tower, Southampton.</ref> Following the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman invasion]] of Britain in AD&nbsp;43 and the conquering of the local Britons in AD&nbsp;70 the fortress settlement of ''[[Clausentum]]'' was established. It was an important trading port and defensive outpost of [[Winchester]], at the site of modern [[Bitterne Manor]]. ''Clausentum'' was defended by a wall and two ditches and is thought to have contained a bath house.<ref>Southampton Through the Ages: A Short History by Elsie M. Sandell (revised 1980)</ref> ''Clausentum'' was not [[End of Roman rule in Britain|abandoned]] until around 410.<ref name=MusArch/>

The [[Anglo-Saxons]] formed a new, larger, settlement across the [[River Itchen, Hampshire|Itchen]] centred on what is now the [[St Mary's, Southampton|St Mary's]] area of the city. The settlement was known as ''Hamwic'',<ref name=MusArch/> which evolved into ''Hamtun'' and then ''Hampton''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba66/feat3.shtml |access-date=19 October 2009 |date=August 2002 |author=British Archaeology Magazine |title=Great Sites: Hamwic |quote=Hamwic, which is described as a commercial port (mercimonium).

===11th–13th centuries===
Following the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066, Southampton became the major port of transit between the then capital of England, Winchester, and [[Normandy]]. [[Southampton Castle]] was built in the 12th century<ref name="Rance"/> and surviving remains of 12th-century merchants' houses such as ''King John's House'' and ''Canute's Palace'' are evidence of the wealth that existed in the town at this time.<ref name="RancePP34">{{cite book |last=Rance |first=Adrian |title=Southampton.

The [[Franciscan friary in Southampton]] was founded circa 1233.<ref name="Ruddock">Alwyn A. Ruddock, The Greyfriars in Southampton, Papers & Proceedings of the Hampshire Field Club & Archaeological Society, 16:2 (1946), pp. 137–47</ref> The friars constructed a water supply system in 1290, which carried water from Conduit Head (remnants of which survive near Hill Lane, [[Shirley, Southampton|Shirley]]) some {{cvt|1.7|km|1|order=flip}} to the site of the friary inside the town walls.<ref name="Davies">Rev.

The friars granted use of the water to the town in 1310.<ref name="Davies"/>

===14th century===
Between 1327 and 1330, the King and Council received a petition from the people of Southampton. The community of Southampton claimed that Robert Batail of Winchelsea and other men of the [[Cinque Ports]] came to Southampton under the pretence that they were a part of [[Thomas of Lancaster]]'s rebellion against [[Edward II]]. The community thought that they were in conspiracy with [[Hugh le Despenser the Younger]]. The petition states that, the supposed rebels in the [[Despenser War]] 'came to Southampton harbour, and burnt their ships, and their goods, chattels and merchandise which was in them, and carried off other goods, chattels and merchandise of theirs found there, and took some of the ships with them, to a loss to them of £8000 and more.'<ref>The National Archives, SC 8/17/833, Petitioners: People of Southampton. Addressees: King and council.</ref> For their petition to the King somewhere after 1321 and before 1327 earned some of the people of Southampton a prison sentence at [[Portchester Castle]], possibly for insinuating the king's advisor Hugh le Despenser the Younger acted in conspiracy with the Cinque Port men to damage Southampton, a flourishing port in the fourteenth century. When King [[Edward III]] came to the throne, this petition was given to the king and his mother, [[Isabella of France|Queen Isabella]], who was in charge of the town, and the country at this stage likely organised the [[writ of trespass]] that took any guilt away from the community at Southampton.

In his 1854 book ''The Cruise of the Steam Yacht North Star'' John Choules described Southampton thus: "I hardly know a town that can show a more beautiful Main Street than Southampton, except it be Oxford. The High Street opens from the quay, and under various names it winds in a gently sweeping line for one mile and a half, and is of very handsome width. The variety of style and color of material in the buildings affords an exhibition of outline, light and colour, that I think is seldom equalled. The shops are very elegant, and the streets are kept exceedingly clean."

[[File:Southampton-CivicCentre-West.jpg|thumb|left|[[Southampton Civic Centre]]]]

After the establishment of Hampshire County Council, following the passage of the [[Local Government Act|1888 Local Government Act]], Southampton became a [[county borough]] within the [[counties of England|county]] of Hampshire, which meant that the Corporation in Southampton had the combined powers of a lower-tier (borough) and an upper-tier (county) council within the city boundaries, while the new county council was responsible for upper-tier functions outside the city of Southampton. The ancient shire county, along with its associated assizes, was known as the ''County of Southampton''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/entry_page.jsp;jsessionid=831E0EE166940B068F901D2E5F5D2B33?text_id=929180&word=NULL |title=Map of the County of Southampton |author=Greenwood & Co |year=1826 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224152528/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/entry_page.jsp;jsessionid=831E0EE166940B068F901D2E5F5D2B33?text_id=929180&word=NULL |archive-date=24 February 2015 |access-date=21 September 2007}}</ref> or ''Southamptonshire''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.luckners.com/auction.aspx?Selection=ByCategory&AuctionID=20802&Value=7-0 |access-date=21 September 2007 |year=1870 |author=John Marius Wilson |title=Southamptonshire |publisher=[[Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022200259/http://luckners.com/auction.aspx?Selection=ByCategory&AuctionID=20802&Value=7-0 |archive-date=22 October 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> This was officially changed to ''Hampshire'' in 1959, although the county had been commonly known as Hampshire (and previously Hantescire – the origin of the abbreviation "Hants.") for centuries. In the [[Local Government Act 1972|reorganisation of English and Welsh local government that took effect on 1 April 1974]], Southampton lost its county borough when it became a [[non-metropolitan district]] (i.e. with lower-tier local government functions only) within a modified [[non-metropolitan county]] of Hampshire (Bournemouth and Christchurch were transferred to the neighbouring non-metropolitan county of [[Dorset]]). From this date, Hampshire County Council became responsible for all upper-tier functions within its boundaries, including Southampton, until local government was once again reorganised in the late 1990s.

Southampton as a port and city has had a long history of administrative independence of the surrounding County; as far back as the reign of King John the town and its port were removed from the writ of the King's Sheriff in Hampshire and the rights of custom and toll were granted by the King to the burgesses of Southampton over the port of Southampton and the Port of Portsmouth;<ref name="Edwin Welch">Welch E, (1976), "Southampton City Charters", City of Southampton, additional text.</ref> this tax farm was granted for an annual fee of £200 in the charter dated at Orival on 29 June 1199. The definition of the port of Southampton was apparently broader than today and embraced all of the area between [[Lymington]] and Langstone. The corporation had resident representatives in Newport, Lymington and Portsmouth.<ref name="British History Online">{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42036 |title=The borough of Southampton: General historical account |editor=William Page |year=1908 |publisher=British History Online |access-date=17 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104100057/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42836 |archive-date=4 November 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> By a charter of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], granted on 9 March 1446/7 (25+26 Hen. VI, m. 52), the mayor, bailiffs and burgesses of the towns and ports of Southampton and Portsmouth became a County incorporate and separate from Hampshire. The status of the town was changed by a later charter of Charles I by at once the formal separation from Portsmouth and the recognition of Southampton as a county. The formal title of the town became "The Town and County of the Town of Southampton".{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} These charters and Royal Grants, of which there were many, also set out the governance and regulation of the town and port which remained the "constitution" of the town until the local government organisation of the later Victorian period when the Local Government Act 1888 set up County Councils and County Borough Councils across England and Wales, including Southampton County Borough Council. Under this regime, "The Town and County of the Town of Southampton" became a county borough with responsibility for all aspects of local government. On 24 February 1964 Elizabeth II, by Letters Patent, granted the County Borough of Southampton the title of "City", so creating "The City and County of the City of Southampton".<ref name="Soton,County">{{London Gazette|issue=43258|date=28 February 1964|page=1856}}</ref> This did not, however, affect its composition or powers.

The city has undergone many changes to its governance over the centuries and once again became administratively independent from Hampshire County as it was made into a [[unitary authority]] in a local government reorganisation on 1 April 1997, a result of the [[Local Government Act 1992|1992 Local Government Act]]. The district remains part of the Hampshire [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]].

[[Southampton City Council]] consists of 51&nbsp;councillors, 3 for each of the 17 wards. [[Southampton local elections|Council elections]] are held in early May for one third of the seats (one councillor for each ward), elected for a four-year term, so there are elections three years out of four.

Southampton is one of 16 cities and towns in England and Wales to have a ceremonial sheriff who acts as a deputy for the mayor. Traditionally the sheriff serves for one year after, which they will become the mayor of Southampton.

Southampton's submission of an application for Lord Mayor status, as part of [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Platinum Jubilee Civic Honours]] Competition 2022, was successful.<ref>{{cite web |date=19 May 2022 |title=Platinum Jubilee: Eight new cities created in Queen's honour |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61505857 |access-date=20 May 2022 |website=BBC News}}</ref> Once the Letters Patent were published, the current Mayor (Councillor Jaqui Rayment) became the first Lord Mayor of Southampton.

==Geography==
The geography of Southampton is influenced by the sea and rivers. The city lies at the northern tip of the [[Southampton Water]], a deep water estuary, which is a [[ria]] formed at the end of the last Ice Age and which opens into [[The Solent]]. At the head of Southampton Water the rivers Test and Itchen converge.<ref name="southampton260">''The Port of Southampton''L. E. Tavener Economic Geography, Vol. 26, No. 4 (October 1950), pp. 260–73</ref> The Test — which has a salt marsh that makes it ideal for salmon fishing<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/commondata/acrobat/river_test__627604pdf |access-date=28 July 2007 |author=Environment Agency |title=The River Test |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311192939/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/commondata/acrobat/river_test__627604pdf |archive-date=11 March 2007}}</ref> — runs along the western edge of the city, while the Itchen splits Southampton in two—east and west. The city centre is located between the two rivers.

Town Quay is the original public quay, and dates from the 13th century. Today's Eastern Docks were created in the 1830s by land reclamation of the mud flats between the Itchen and Test estuaries. The Western Docks date from the 1930s when the Southern Railway Company commissioned a major land reclamation and dredging programme.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.solentforum.hants.org.uk/othercoast/western_solent_smp.htm#test6 |access-date=28 July 2007 |author=The Solent Forum |title=Western Solent and Southampton Water Shoreline Management Plan |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922004912/http://www.solentforum.hants.org.uk/othercoast/western_solent_smp.htm#test6 |archive-date=22 September 2007 }}</ref> Most of the material used for reclamation came from dredging of Southampton Water,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.egovmonitor.com/node/1811 |date=8 July 2005 |access-date=28 July 2007 |author=eGovernment Monitor |title=Web Maps Out The Past |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607191222/http://www.egovmonitor.com/node/1811 |archive-date=7 June 2007 }}</ref> to ensure that the port can continue to handle large ships.

Southampton Water has the benefit of a double high tide, with two high tide peaks,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pol.ac.uk/home/insight/tidefaq.html |access-date=28 July 2007 |author=Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory |title=Tides |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810230813/http://www.pol.ac.uk/home/insight/tidefaq.html |archive-date=10 August 2007 }}</ref> making the movement of large ships easier.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southamptonvts.co.uk/ |access-date=28 July 2007 |author=Associated British Ports |title=Southampton VTS–ABP Southampton |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705005757/http://www.southamptonvts.co.uk/ |archive-date=5 July 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> This is not caused as popularly supposed by the presence of the Isle of Wight, but is a function of the shape and depth of the [[English Channel]]. In this area the general water flow is distorted by more local conditions reaching across to France.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bristolnomads.org.uk/stuff/double_tides.htm |access-date=13 July 2009 |author=Captain M J Ridge, FRICS MCIT |title=English Channel double tides |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822144340/http://www.bristolnomads.org.uk/stuff/double_tides.htm |archive-date=22 August 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The city lies in the [[Hampshire Basin]], which sits atop chalk beds.<ref name="southampton260"/>

The [[River Test]] runs along the western border of the city, separating it from the [[New Forest]]. There are bridges over the Test from Southampton, including the road and rail bridges at [[Redbridge, Hampshire|Redbridge]] in the south and the [[M27 motorway]] to the north. The [[River Itchen, Hampshire|River Itchen]] runs through the middle of the city and is bridged in several places. The northernmost bridge, and the first to be built,<ref>{{cite book |last=Holt |first=John |author2=Anne Cole |title=A bend in the River |publisher=Bitterne Local History Society |date=February 1992 |location=Southampton}}</ref> is at [[Mansbridge]], where the [[A27 road]] crosses the Itchen. The original bridge is closed to road traffic, but is still standing and open to pedestrians and cyclists. The river is bridged again at [[Swaythling]], where Woodmill Bridge separates the tidal and non tidal sections of the river. Further south is [[Cobden Bridge]] which is notable as it was opened as a free bridge (it was originally named the Cobden Free Bridge), and was never a [[toll bridge]]. Downstream of the Cobden Bridge is the Northam Railway Bridge, then the [[Northam Bridge|Northam Road Bridge]], which was the first major pre-stressed concrete bridge to be constructed in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbdg.org.uk/bridge_history.html |access-date=11 March 2008 |publisher=www.cbdg.org.uk |title=History of Concrete Bridges |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007075419/http://www.cbdg.org.uk/bridge_history.html |archive-date=7 October 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> The southernmost, and newest, bridge on the Itchen is the [[Itchen Bridge]], which is a toll bridge.

===Areas and suburbs===
{{Southampton suburbs map}}
{{See also|Category:Areas of Southampton}}

Southampton is divided into council wards, suburbs, constituencies, ecclesiastical parishes, and other less formal areas. It has a number of parks and green spaces, the largest being the 148-hectare [[Southampton Common]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southampton.gov.uk/Images/Southampton%20Common%20Green%20Flag%20Mgt%20Plan%20pages%201-22_tcm46-178081.pdf |access-date=26 August 2007 |author=Southampton City Council |title=Southampton Common Green Flag Management Plan |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925221533/http://www.southampton.gov.uk/Images/Southampton%20Common%20Green%20Flag%20Mgt%20Plan%20pages%201-22_tcm46-178081.pdf |archive-date=25 September 2007 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> parts of which are used to host the annual summer festivals, circuses and fun fairs. The Common includes Hawthorns Urban Wildlife Centre<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southampton.gov.uk/leisure/southamptonparks/thehawthorns/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028074247/http://www.southampton.gov.uk/leisure/southamptonparks/thehawthorns/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 October 2007 |access-date=9 October 2008 |author=Southampton City Council |title=The Hawthorns Urban Wildlife Centre }}</ref> on the former site of Southampton Zoo, a paddling pool and several lakes and ponds. The common also hosts the [[Parkrun]] event every Saturday.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.parkrun.org.uk/southampton/course/ | title=Course &#124; Southampton parkrun }}</ref>

Council estates are in the [[Weston, Southampton|Weston]], [[Thornhill, Hampshire|Thornhill]] and [[Townhill Park]] districts. The city is ranked 96th most deprived out of all 354 Local Authorities in England.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southampton.gov.uk/thecouncil/thecity/research/default.asp#0 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820102708/http://www.southampton.gov.uk/thecouncil/thecity/research/default.asp#0 |url-status=dead |archive-date=20 August 2007 |access-date=24 July 2007 |author=Southampton City Council |title=Research, Information and Statistics}}</ref>

In 2006–2007, 1,267 residential dwellings were built in the city — the highest number for 15 years. Over 94 per cent of these were flats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southampton.gov.uk/Images/Southampton%20City%20Statistics%20and%20Research%20July%202007_tcm46-182704.pdf |access-date=24 July 2007 |author=Southampton City Council |title=Southampton Statistics, July 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809221253/http://www.southampton.gov.uk/Images/Southampton%20City%20Statistics%20and%20Research%20July%202007_tcm46-182704.pdf |archive-date=9 August 2007 }}</ref>

There are 16 [[Wards of the United Kingdom|Electoral Wards]] in Southampton, each consisting of longer-established neighbourhoods (see below).

Settlements outside the city are sometimes considered suburbs of Southampton, including [[Chartwell Green]], [[Chilworth, Hampshire|Chilworth]], [[Nursling]], [[Rownhams]], [[Totton]], [[Eastleigh]] and [[West End, Hampshire|West End]]. The villages of [[Marchwood]], [[Ashurst, Hampshire|Ashurst]] and [[Hedge End]] may be considered [[exurb]]s of Southampton.

===Climate===
As with the rest of the UK, Southampton experiences an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''). Its southerly, low-lying and sheltered location ensures it is among the warmer, sunnier cities in the UK. It has held the record for the highest temperature in the UK for June at {{cvt|35.6|C|F}} since 1976.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.torro.org.uk/site/maxtemps.php |title=June 1976 maximum |access-date=21 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117053706/http://www.torro.org.uk/site/maxtemps.php |archive-date=17 January 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Extremes |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/c/f/Fact_sheet_No._9.pdf |work=Fact Sheets |publisher=Met Office |access-date=11 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028123740/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/c/f/Fact_sheet_No._9.pdf |archive-date=28 October 2012}}</ref>

===Energy===
[[File:Geothermal plant.jpg|thumb|Southampton's geothermal power station]]
The centre of Southampton is located above a large hot water [[aquifer]] that provides [[Geothermal energy|geothermal]] power to some of the city's buildings. This energy is processed at a plant in the West Quay region in Southampton city centre, the only [[Geothermal power in the United Kingdom|geothermal power station]] in the UK. The plant provides electricity for the [[Port of Southampton]] and hot water to the [[Southampton District Energy Scheme]] used by many buildings including the [[Westquay]] shopping centre. In a 2006 survey of carbon emissions in major UK cities conducted by British Gas, Southampton was ranked as being one of the lowest [[carbon emissions|carbon-emitting]] cities in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishgasnews.co.uk/index.asp?PageID=16&Year=2006&NewsID=686 |date=22 May 2006 |author=British Gas News |title=Reading named as the UK's highest CO2 hot spot |access-date=8 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713092351/http://www.britishgasnews.co.uk/index.asp?PageID=16&Year=2006&NewsID=686 |archive-date=13 July 2007 }}</ref>

In 2016–17, 169,700 residents of Southampton aged 16–64 were in employment, representing a rate of 71.4% – lower than the national rate of 74.4%. 6,600 were unemployed, representing 5% of the economically active population.<ref name="Southampton Strategic Assessment 2017">{{cite web |url=http://www.publichealth.southampton.gov.uk/images/6-labour-market-sea-sep-2017-final.pdf |access-date=18 May 2020 |author=Southampton City Council |title="Southampton Strategic Assessment 2017 |archive-date=7 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200807074141/http://www.publichealth.southampton.gov.uk/images/6-labour-market-sea-sep-2017-final.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2016–17, 24.8% of the city's resident population aged 16–64 were classed as economically inactive, higher than the national rate of 21.8%, although for over 40% of this group the reason was that they were students.<ref name="Southampton Strategic Assessment 2017"/>

Southampton has always been a port, and the docks have long been a major employer in the city. In particular, it is a port for [[cruise ships]]; its heyday was the first half of the 20th century, and in particular the inter-war years, when it handled almost half the passenger traffic of the UK. Today it remains home to luxury cruise ships, as well as being the largest freight port on the Channel coast and fourth-largest UK port by tonnage,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/maritime/ports/provportstats2007 |title=(DfT) Provisional Port Statistics 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122054646/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/maritime/ports/provportstats2007 |archive-date=22 November 2008}}</ref> with several [[container (cargo)|container]] terminals. Unlike some other ports, such as [[Liverpool]], London, and [[Bristol]], where industry and docks have largely moved out of the city centres leaving room for redevelopment, Southampton retains much of its inner-city industry. Despite the still-active and expanding docklands to the west of the city centre, further enhanced with the opening of a fourth cruise terminal in 2009, parts of the eastern docks have been redeveloped; the [[Ocean Village, Southampton|Ocean Village]] development, which included a local [[marina]] and small entertainment complex, is a good example. Southampton is home to the headquarters of both the [[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]] and the [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]] of the Department for Transport in addition to cruise operator [[Carnival UK]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.travelweekly.co.uk/Articles/2007/12/12/26148/carnival-uk-signs-for-new-southampton-cruise-terminal.html |title=Carnival UK signs for new Southampton cruise terminal |publisher=TravelWeekly |date=12 December 2007 |access-date=5 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721203022/http://www.travelweekly.co.uk/Articles/2007/12/12/26148/carnival-uk-signs-for-new-southampton-cruise-terminal.html |archive-date=21 July 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businesssouthampton.com/content/default.asp?PageId=255 |title=Carnival UK |publisher=businesssouthampton.com |access-date=5 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214052257/http://www.businesssouthampton.com/content/default.asp?PageId=255 |archive-date=14 December 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>

During the 20th century, a more diverse range of industry also came to the city, including aircraft and car manufacturing, cables, electrical engineering products, and petrochemicals.

Southampton currently has three major city centre regeneration schemes under way. Construction on the £132m Bargate Quarter scheme, which is being built on the site of the former Bargate Centre, started in February 2022 and will provide over 500 new homes, new retail and hospitality venues and a new linear park running alongside the medieval town walls which is hoped to be completed by late 2024. A £200m redevelopment scheme opposite [[Southampton Central railway station|Southampton Central Railway Station]] is also planned and will replace the former Toys R Us store which is situated off Western Esplanade. The {{cvt|4.8|acre|adj=on}} Maritime Gateway scheme will have a new pedestrian-led public area with 600 new homes and new commercial space. Located close to the waterfront, Leisure World is Southampton's largest redevelopment project covering {{cvt|13|acres}} and replacing the original Leisure World development which first opened in 1997. The £280m scheme will deliver 650 new homes, two hotels, a cinema, casino and catering outlets, with the first phase expected to complete by 2024/25.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

This was particularly evident on 11 November 2008, when the Cunard liner ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'' departed the city for the final time amid a spectacular fireworks display, after a full day of celebrations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chriscunard.com/qe2/qe2-history/ |title=QE2 Retirement – Southampton |website=Chris' Cunard Page |date=4 February 2015 |access-date=12 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190712040811/http://www.chriscunard.com/qe2/qe2-history/ |archive-date=12 July 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Cunard ships are regularly christened in the city, for example {{MS|Queen Victoria|3=2}} was named by [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|The Duchess of Cornwall]] in December 2007, and [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] named [[MS Queen Elizabeth|''Queen Elizabeth'']] in the city during October 2011. The [[Duchess of Cambridge]] performed the naming ceremony of ''[[Royal Princess (2012)|Royal Princess]]'' on 13 June 2013.

At certain times of the year, the ''Queen Mary 2'', ''Queen Elizabeth'', and ''Queen Victoria'' may all visit Southampton at the same time, in an event commonly called 'Arrival of the Three Queens'. The [[Cunard Line]] maintains a regular transatlantic service to [[New York City]] for most of the year, with its [[ocean liner]] [[Queen Mary 2|RMS Queen Mary 2]].

The importance of Southampton to the cruise industry was indicated by [[P&O Cruises]]' 175th-anniversary celebrations, which included all seven of the company's liners visiting Southampton in a single day. ''[[Azamara Pursuit|Adonia]]'', {{MV|Arcadia|2004|2}}, ''Aurora'', ''Azura'', ''Oceana'', ''Oriana'', and ''Ventura'' all left the city in a procession on 3 July 2012.<ref>{{Citation |title=Magnificent seven ships to make up 'The Grand Event' at Southampton |newspaper=Southern Daily Echo |date=18 April 2012 |url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/9655678.Magnificent_seven_ships_to_make_up__The_Grand_Event__at_Southampton/ |access-date=18 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615220035/http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/9655678.Magnificent_seven_ships_to_make_up__The_Grand_Event__at_Southampton/ |archive-date=15 June 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Ferry===
While Southampton is no longer the base for any cross-channel ferries, it is the terminus for three internal ferry services, all of which operate from terminals at [[Town Quay]]. Two of these, a [[RORO|car ferry]] service and a fast [[catamaran]] passenger ferry service, provide links to [[Cowes|East Cowes]] and [[Cowes]], respectively, on the [[Isle of Wight]] and are operated by [[Red Funnel]]. The third ferry is the [[Hythe Pier, Railway and Ferry|Hythe Ferry]], providing a passenger service to [[Hythe, Hampshire|Hythe]] on the other side of [[Southampton Water]].

Southampton used to be home to a number of ferry services to the continent, with destinations such as [[San Sebastián|San Sebastian]], [[Lisbon]], [[Tangier]], and [[Casablanca]]. A ferry port was built during the 1960s.<ref>{{usurped|1=[https://web.archive.org/web/20080416223023/http://www.plimsoll.org/Southampton/TheDocks/EasternDocks/OuterDock3.asp The result appeared to be very successful]}} Retrieved 2 January 2008</ref> However, a number of these relocated to Portsmouth and by 1996, there were no longer any cross-channel car ferries operating from Southampton with the exception of services to the [[Isle of Wight]]. The land used for Southampton Ferry Port was sold off and a retail and housing development was built on the site. The Princess Alexandra Dock was converted into a marina. Reception areas for new cars now fill the Eastern Docks where passengers, dry docks and trains used to be.[[File:New buses for Bluestar.jpg|thumb|Bluestar buses outside the Guildhall]]
