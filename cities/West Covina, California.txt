The first permanent settlers arrived in West Covina in 1905. Most famous among them were William Payne, Bob Dancer, Bender, Robinson and Larsen. They cleared the land of sagebrush and cactus. They also planted the first walnut trees in the area.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQ1VAwAAQBAJ&dq=west+covina+++P%C3%ADo+Pico&pg=PT268 | title=Fundamentally Crazy | isbn=9781257905300 | last1=Cheldin | first1=Ted | date=August 2011 | publisher=Lulu.com }}</ref>

West Covina was incorporated as an independent city in 1923 to prevent the city of [[Covina, California|Covina]] from building a sewage farm in the area.<ref name=historical>{{Cite web |title=Historical West Covina {{!}} City of West Covina |url=https://www.westcovina.org/about-the-city/history |access-date=October 6, 2022 |website=www.westcovina.org |language=en}}</ref> Benjamin Franklin Maxson Jr. (1897–1928) initiated the incorporation process and was the first mayor.
