[[File:Bih cantons en.png|thumb|250px|right|Cantons of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].]]
The '''Sarajevo Canton''', officially the '''Canton of Sarajevo'''<ref name="Constitution" /> ({{langx|bs|Kanton Sarajevo}};<ref name="Constitution" /> {{langx|hr|Sarajevska županija}}; {{Langx|sr|Сарајевски кантон|translit=Sarajevski kanton}}), is one of the ten [[cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Its cantonal seat is the city of [[Sarajevo]], also the capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The Canton represents the [[Sarajevo metropolitan area|metro area]] of Sarajevo. It contains 97% of the city's population, but a much smaller percentage of the official land area. The majority of the population is [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] (83.8%).<ref name="lexglobal.org">{{Cite web |url=http://lexglobal.org/files/Sanja%20Kutnjak%20Ivkovich-ICTY-VICTIMS-ASSOCIATION.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 May 2012 |archive-date=21 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421064607/http://lexglobal.org/files/Sanja%20Kutnjak%20Ivkovich-ICTY-VICTIMS-ASSOCIATION.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==History==
{{See also|History of Sarajevo}}
The history of Sarajevo dates back to Neolithic times, when the [[Butmir culture]] made its mountains and hills their home. In ancient times, the Sarajevo area (Canton) was occupied by the [[Illyrians]]. The local tribe, the Daesitates, controlled most of the area. They were a warlike bunch and the last Illyrian tribe to resist Roman rule, which finally came in [[Anno Domini|AD]]&nbsp;9. Under Roman rule, many roads were constructed in the region, as well as a city on top of modern-day [[Ilidža]]. During the Middle Ages, the area of Sarajevo Canton was a key part of the Bosnian Kingdom. The toponym [[Vrhbosna]] existed somewhere in the region and was one of the notable settlements at the time.

True development of the region came after the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest when local [[Muslim]] noble [[Isa-Beg Isakovic|Isa-Beg Isaković]] established the roots of the modern city of [[Sarajevo]], between 1461 and 1463. The region grew along with the city, which quickly, after Istanbul, became the most important in the Balkans. Later rule by [[Austria-Hungary]] modernized and westernized the region. Under [[Yugoslavia]], there was major development of the area, which more than tripled in size. Because of its ideal geographical location in between mountains, Sarajevo was chosen to host the [[1984 Winter Olympics]]. Much of this progress was offset however by the [[Yugoslav Wars]] in the early 1990s.

The Sarajevo Canton was a result of this warfare, created by the Washington Accords in 1994, and its boundaries defined by the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]] in 1995.

==Government==
Like all [[Cantons of Bosnia|Cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the head of the Sarajevo Canton is called the [[List of heads of the Sarajevo Canton|Prime Minister]]. The current Prime Minister is Nihad Uk (since 24 March 2023).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vlada.ks.gov.ba/vlada/premijer|title=Premijer &#124; Vlada Kantona Sarajevo|website=vlada.ks.gov.ba}} {{dead link|date=July 2023}}</ref> Like many other heads of executive branches of government in the world, the Prime Minister has a cabinet which helps him go about his duties. The Sarajevo Canton also has ministries, services, and agencies to help in the running of the region.

The Canton is split into 9 municipalities. They are all based on the major settlements in their region, except for Sarajevo, whose size and status as capital city gives it four separate municipalities and its own separate city government. Major cities are in municipalities of the same name in Bosnia and Herzegovina (i.e. Ilidža is part of Ilidža Municipality) whose governments are the de facto city government as their jurisdiction covers the city and all major suburbs.

==Geography==
The Sarajevo Canton has a typical Bosnian geography. It is located close to the geometric center of the country, and contains numerous mountains, including [[Bjelašnica]], [[Igman]], Jahorina, [[Trebević]], and [[Treskavica]]. The cities of the Canton are built predominantly on the hills at the foot of these mountains, and the fields in between them. The most significant of these is the Sarajevo field, a small depression upon which the bulk of the city is built upon. The [[Miljacka]] river passes through the Canton. [[Vrelo Bosne]], the source of the [[Bosna (river)|Bosna River]], is found in Sarajevo Canton and is the source of water for most residents of Sarajevo.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Economy==

The employment rate in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is 45.5% officially; however, grey economy may reduce actual unemployment to between 25 and 30%, while in Sarajevo the official unemployment rate is around 15% of the labour force.

Major industries in the region include tourism, food processing, manufacturing and IT. Several major Bosnian companies are based in the Canton such as [[Bosnalijek]] and [[Bosna Bank International]]. The area also holds the country footholds of numerous foreign corporations, such as [[Coca-Cola]], [[Raiffeisen Bank International]], [[Ziraat Bank]], [[Al Jazeera Media Network|Al Jazeera]], [[Volkswagen]], among many others.

==Demographics==
