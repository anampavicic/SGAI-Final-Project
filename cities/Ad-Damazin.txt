'''Ad-Damazin''' ({{langx|ar|الدمازين|Ad-Damāzīn}}) is the capital city of [[Blue Nile (state)|Blue Nile]], [[Sudan]]. It is the location of the [[Roseires Dam]] and power generation plant.

Ad-Damazin is served by a terminal station of a branch line of the national railway network. However, the train service to Ad-Damazin has been discontinued many years ago. Instead the town can be reached from [[Khartoum]] via a decent tarmac road and by plane. However, [[Damazin Airport]] is mainly served by [[UNMIS]] or government flights. Ad-Damazin is a city filled with many dialects, but the majority of the population speaks Sudanese Arabic, which is an accent of the original Arabic language. The city lies west of the Nile river and northwest of the Roseires reservoir.

[[Blue Nile University]] (Jameat Al Neel Alazraq) is a public university located in Ad-Damazin, established in 1995.<ref>{{cite web
