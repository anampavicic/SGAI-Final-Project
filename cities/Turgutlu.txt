'''Turgutlu''', also known as '''Kasaba''' (''Cassaba'' or ''Casaba'') is a municipality and [[Districts of Turkey|district]] of [[Manisa Province]], [[Turkey]].<ref>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx Büyükşehir İlçe Belediyesi], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 12 July 2023.</ref> Its area is 549&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.harita.gov.tr/uploads/files-folder/il_ilce_alanlari.xlsx|title=İl ve İlçe Yüz ölçümleri|publisher=General Directorate of Mapping|access-date=12 July 2023}}</ref> and its population is 175,401 (2022).<ref name=tuik>{{Cite web |title=Address-based population registration system (ADNKS) results dated 31 December 2022, Favorite Reports|url=https://biruni.tuik.gov.tr/medas/?kn=95&locale=en |access-date=12 July 2023|publisher=[[TÜİK]]|language=en|format=XLS}}</ref> Its elevation is {{cvt|68|m|ft|0}}.

The name derives from the name of the [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] [[clan]] of "[[Turghudlu]]" (''also cited as "Turgut" or "Turgutoğlu"''), recorded as having provided the main support to the [[Bey]]lik of [[Karamanids|Karaman]] during their time of existence <ref>{{cite book|title = The Ottoman Empire, 1300-1481|page=190|isbn=978-975-428-015-9|author = Colin Imber | publisher = Isis Press, [[Istanbul]] |year= 1990}}</ref> and mentioned in historical records as an important political entity as late as the 18th century [[Iran]]. Their settlement in Turgutlu region is thought to have taken place some time in the 15th century at the same time as the Ottoman unification of [[Anatolia]] which resulted in the demise of Karamanids. That nearby Manisa was the center where Ottoman [[Şehzade|shahzade]]s ([[crown prince]]s) received their education must have placed the clan once again in a non-negligible position in their relations this time with the Ottoman dynasty.

The term [[Casaba]] for melons derived from the name of the city, an echo of its 18th-19th century past when it was an important regional trade center and hub, located in the middle of a fertile alluvial plain and with access to outside markets through nearby İzmir.

==General features==
Turgutlu center is at a distance of 31&nbsp;km to Manisa, to which it depends administratively, and at a distance of 50&nbsp;km to the international portuary center of İzmir. Its closeness to these two metropolitan centers both of which have a deep and rooted history marked Turgutlu's destiny since its foundation in the 15th century. Today, the intense industrial activities in the even nearer İzmir district of Kemalpaşa also find considerable repercussions in Turgutlu, which itself has a reputation of being one of the prominent centers of soil industry in Turkey.

There are 44 primary schools and 14 schools providing intermediate education in Turgutlu district, bringing together 1,189 teachers and 28,767 students. There is also a higher professional school, a department of [[Celal Bayar University]], at the district center. The state hospital at Turgutlu center has a bed capacity of 250, and there are also eleven health centers, all corresponding to a health professionals corpus of 370, 135 of whom are doctors.

At fifty-six per cent, Turgutlu district has the highest proportion of agricultural lands across Manisa Province districts in its territory, while the forest lands covering a total area close to twenty thousand hectares, are also of considerable extent.

==Composition==
There are 61 [[mahalle|neighbourhoods]] in Turgutlu District:<ref>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx Mahalle], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 19 September 2023.</ref>

==Industry==
Reconstructed from scratch as of the 1920s, modern Turgutlu is, in addition to a productive agricultural sector, also an important industrial base structured under a Chamber of Industry founded in 1926. It is home to the production installations of [[Tukaş]], one of the most prominent producers of canned [[food]] (principally vegetables and fruits) in Turkey, as well as to [[BMC (Turkey)]], the Turkish branch of the motor vehicle giant [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]], active principally in [[commercial vehicles]], [[truck]]s and [[bus]]es. The town's industrial sector as a whole displays as high a degree of dynamism as its agricultural production, with many small- and medium-sized enterprises active in various fields. Also [[Seramiksan]], one of the leading tile manufacturers of Turkey specialized in the production of ceramic wall and floor tiles, glazed and technical porcelain tiles, has their production installations in Turgutlu.

Experimental mining of [[nickel]] laterites by using a heap leach process in [[Mount Çal]] near Turgutlu started in 2005 by a Turkish subsidiary of [[European Nickel PLC]]. The reserves are estimated to be 33 million tons of ore at 1.13% Nickel and 0.08% cobalt content. The planned development of a nickel mine and processing plant could deeply influence the district's economy with a potential to become one of the most important investments in Turkey's Aegean Region.

==History==

===İzmir-Kasaba Railway===
{{main|Smyrna Cassaba Railway}}
The town was an important regional trade center and hub already since the 18th century. It acquired further importance once it became the first terminus of the 93&nbsp;km. [[Smyrna Cassaba Railway]] whose construction was started from [[İzmir]] in 1863 and which arrived in Kasaba in 1866. This railway was the third started within the territory of the [[Ottoman Empire]] at the time and the first finished within the present-day territory of Turkey.<ref>A short line built in [[Dobruja]] (now in [[Romania]]) was started and finished earlier, and İzmir-[[Aydın]] railway was started earlier in 1856 but finished a year after Smyrna Cassaba Railway in 1867.</ref>

Instead of being laid along the direct route eastwards from İzmir to Turgutlu, about fifty kilometers in length, the line built drew a wide arc advancing first to the north-west from İzmir, through its [[Karşıyaka]] suburb to whose foundation it contributed greatly, and curves eastwards only from [[Menemen]] on, crossing the former [[sanjak]] and the present-day province center of [[Manisa]] to join Turgutlu from the north. [[Belkahve Pass]] between [[Mount Nif]] and [[Mount Sipylus]] on the direct road from İzmir and Turgutlu must have been judged too difficult for a track at the time. This railway was later extended further eastwards reaching a total length exceeding seven hundred kilometers but the operating company preserved the name Smyrna Cassaba. The first concession under the name was granted to a locally based [[English people|English]] entrepreneur named [[Edward Price (entrepreneur)|Edward Price]], who founded the company and built the line, and sold it in 1893 to the [[France|Franco]]-[[Belgium|Belgian]] group [[Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits]], which extended it.<ref>{{cite book|title = Across the Borders: Financing the World's Railways in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries |isbn=978-0-7546-6029-3|editor1-first= Ralf |editor1-last=Roth |editor2-first=Günter |editor2-last=Dinhobl | publisher = [[Ashgate Publishing]]|year= 2008}}</ref> The line was [[nationalization|nationalized]] in 1934 by the young Republic of Turkey in the frame of a general move started in the 1920s regarding Turkey's railways.

From 1867 until 1922, Turgutlu was part of the [[Aydin Vilayet]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The town was made into a [[qadaa|kaza]] (''district center'') in 1868. During the final years of the Ottoman Empire, Kasaba was already a large town whose population well exceeded ten thousand people. During the 1910s, Kasaba was recorded by sources such as G. Sotiriadis (1918) and S. Anagiostopoulou (1997) as having a Greek population averaging at around one sixth of the total, between 3500 and 6000, in a subdistrict aggregate of thirty-five thousand and a center town population of around fourteen thousand.<ref>The relayer of the demographic data according to Greek sources, the researcher [[Georgios Nakratzas]] adds as a personal note that his own maternal family who were from Kasaba's Hamzabeyli village were at the origin [[economic migrants]] who had immigrated to Anatolia in the 1770s from [[Mani Peninsula]] in mainland [[Greece]].</ref>

===Turgutlu during the Turkish War of Independence===
Turgutlu remained under [[Greek people|Greek]] occupation between 29 May 1919 and 7 September 1922. The most bitter blow suffered by the town has been the fire started by the retreating Greek army on 5 September 1922, and which has lasted for two whole days, destroying 6127 buildings in a total of 6328, the historic Pasha Mosque, and the 20000 manuscript books preserved in the town library, as well as at the very least a thousand human lives (based on the corpses that could be counted). The survival of another historical monument, the [[Hacı Zeynel Mosque]] and of the surrounding small agglomeration is locally still interpreted as divine intervention.<ref>James Loder Park, the U.S. Vice-Consul in [[Istanbul]] at the time, who toured much of the devastated area immediately after the Greek evacuation, described the situation in the western Anatolian cities and towns he has seen, as follows: "[[Manisa]]...almost completely wiped out by fire (...). Cassaba (present day Turgutlu) was a town of 40,000 souls, 3,000 of whom were non-Moslems. Of these 37,000 Turks only 6,000 could be accounted for among the living, while 1,000 Turks were known to have been shot or burned to death. Of the 2,000 buildings that constituted the city, only 200 remained standing. Ample testimony was available to the effect that the city was systematically destroyed (...). [[Kerosene]] and [[gasoline]] were freely used to make the destruction more certain, rapid and complete. (...) The percentages of buildings destroyed in (...) Manisa [was] 90 percent, [in] Cassaba (Turgutlu) 90 percent, [in] [[Alaşehir]] 70 percent, [in] [[Salihli]] 65 percent. The burning of these cities was not desultory, nor intermittent, nor accidental, but well planned and thoroughly organized. (...) Without complete figures, (...) it may safely be surmised that 'atrocities' [consisting of murder, torture and rape] committed by retiring Greeks numbered well into thousands in the four cities under consideration."</ref> According to a number of sources, the retreating Greek army carried out a scorched-earth policy while fleeing from Anatolia during the final phase of the war.<ref name="Sydney Nettleton Fisher 1969, p. 386">[[Sydney Nettleton Fisher]], ''The Middle East: a history'', New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1969, p. 386</ref> According to a report of the Consul Park 90% of the buildings of the town were destroyed, as result of organized operations accompanied by several atrocities.<ref name="U.S. Vice-Consul James Loder Park 1923">U.S. Vice-Consul James Loder Park ''to [[Secretary of State]], [[Smyrna]], 11 April 1923.''
