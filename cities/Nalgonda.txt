'''Nalgonda''' is a city<ref>{{cite web|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/paper2/data_files/India2/Table_2_PR_Cities_1Lakh_and_Above.pdf|title=Cities having population 1 lakh and above, Census 2011}}</ref> and [[municipality]] in the [[India]]n [[States and union territories of India|state]] of [[Telangana]]. It is the headquarters of the [[Nalgonda district]], as well as the headquarters of the Nalgonda [[Tehsil|mandal]] in the Nalgonda [[revenue division]].<ref name=census>{{cite web|title=District Census Handbook – Nalgonda|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/2808_PART_B_DCHB_NALGONDA.pdf |website=Census of India|access-date=22 September 2015|pages=13–14, 40, 52}}</ref> It is located about {{convert|90|km|mi|0}} from the state capital [[Hyderabad]].

== Etymology ==
In the past, Nalgonda was referred to as ''Nilagiri''. During the medieval [[Bahamani Sultanate|Bahamani kingdom]], it was renamed Nalgunda.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924088964154/page/n6|title=Caste, Tribes|date=1920|work=The castes and tribes of H.E.H. the Nizam's dominions by Siraj-ul-Hassan, Syed|publisher=Bombay : The Times Press}}</ref>  The name was changed to "Nalgonda" for official uses during the rule of the later [[Nizam]] kings.

== History ==
{{Main|Telangana Rebellion}}

=== Paleolithic Age ===
There is archaeological evidence that [[Paleolithic Age|Paleolithic]] people lived in the area that is now Nalgonda, fashioning tools and weapons out of stone.  Some of these implements have been found in the Nalgonda area, similar to those discovered at the [[Sloan archaeological site]] in [[Arkansas]].

=== Neolithic Age ===
Traces of [[Neolithic Age|Neolithic]] culture were found at Chota Yelupu, where sling stones and other contemporary objects were excavated.  Evidence of [[Megalithic]] culture was also found via the discovery of innumerable burials at various places around Nalgonda.

=== The Mauryas and Satavahanas (230 BC – 218 BC) ===
The political history of the Nalgonda district commences with the [[Mauryas]].  During the reign of [[Ashoka]] the Great, the Mauryas maintained control over the Nalgonda region.  Later, the [[Satavahanas]], who ruled between 230 BC and 218 BC, took control of the area.

During this period, the region established trade contacts with the [[Roman Empire]].

=== Ikshvakus (227 AD – 306 AD) ===
In 227 AD, the [[Ikshvaku dynasty]] took control of the region.  During this period, members of various [[Saka]] tribes migrated to the area. [[Buddhism]] flourished during this time.

=== Invasion of Samudragupta ===
After the Ikshvakus, the [[Pallava]]s and [[Yadavas of Devagiri|Yadavas]] fought for supremacy over the region.  However, after [[Samudragupta]] (c. 335 AD – c. 375 AD) invaded and conquered most of India, the area fell under the control of his [[Gupta Empire]].  The Empire fell in the 6th century.

=== The Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas ===
Starting in the 6th century, the [[Chalukya dynasty]] ruled the modern-day Nalgonda region, as well as much of southern and central India.  A major portion of the Nalgonda area appears to have passed from the Chalukyas of [[Badami]] to the [[Rashtrakuta]]s.  However, the Rashtrakutas fell in 973, and power shifted to the Chalukyas of [[Basavakalyan|Kalyani]].  The Chalukyas continued to rule the area until the end of the 12th century.

=== Medieval period ===
During the medieval era, the [[Kakatiya dynasty]] took control of the region from the western Chalukyas.  During the reign of [[Prataparudra II]], in 1323, the kingdom was [[annexation|annexed]] to the [[Tughluq]] Empire.

When [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] ruled (around 1324–1351), [[Musunuri]] chief [[Kapayanayaka]] ceded a part of Nalgonda to [[Ala-ud-din Hasan Bahman Shah]] of the Bahmani Sultanate.  He annexed the region to the Bahmani Kingdom.

In 1455, [[Jalal Khan (Bahmani rebel)|Jalal Khan]] he declared himself king at Nalgonda, but this was short-lived.  He was quickly defeated and the region brought back to the Bahmani Kingdom.

During the time of the Bahmani Sultan Shihabud-din Mahmun, Sultan [[Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah|Quli]] was appointed as [[tarafdar]] of the [[Telangana]] region (now the state of Telangana).  Quli's son, Jamshid, took control of the region from his father.  Later, [[Qutub Shahi]]s took control of the region, and maintained it until 1687.

=== Modern period: Mughals and Asaf Jahis ===
[[Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asaf Jah I|Nizam-ul-Mulk]] ([[Asaf Jah I]]) defeated Mubasiz Khan at Shaker Khere in [[Berar Subah|Berar]] and ruled the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] autonomously.  This district, like the other districts of Telangana, was controlled by [[Asaf Jahi]]s, and remained under their rule for nearly two hundred and twenty-five years.

== Geography ==
Nalgonda is located at {{Coord|17.050|N|79.2667|E|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/02/Nalgonda.html|title=Nalgonda|publisher=Fallingrain|work=fallingrain.com|access-date=2014-07-30}}</ref> It has an average elevation of {{convert|420|m}}.
