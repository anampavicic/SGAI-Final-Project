'''Burbank''' is a city in the southeastern end of the [[San Fernando Valley]] in [[Los Angeles County, California]], United States. Located {{convert|7|mi|km}} northwest of [[downtown Los Angeles]], Burbank has a population of 107,337.<ref name="Census 2020">{{cite web| url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/burbankcitycalifornia| title=Quick Facts: Burbank city, California| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| access-date=January 7, 2022}}</ref> The city was named after [[David Burbank]], who established a sheep ranch there in 1867. Burbank consists of two distinct areas: a downtown/foothill section, in the foothills of the [[Verdugo Mountains]], and the flatland section.

Numerous media and entertainment companies are headquartered or have significant production facilities in Burbank—often called the "Media Capital of the World"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.usacitydirectories.com/travelamerica/index.php?entry=entry070420-130359 | title = Burbank, Ca. – Media Capital of the World | work = Travel America | date = April 20, 2007 | access-date = December 21, 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150910002324/http://www.usacitydirectories.com/travelamerica/index.php?entry=entry070420-130359 | archive-date = September 10, 2015 | url-status = dead }}</ref> and only a few miles northeast of [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]]—including [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros.

Universal plays a key role in attractions and entertainment in Burbank, with its theme park [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] and the NBCUniversal building. The broadcast network [[The CW]] is also headquartered in Burbank. "Beautiful Downtown Burbank" was stated often as a joke on ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', as both shows were taped at [[The Burbank Studios|NBC's former studios]]. The [[Hollywood Burbank Airport]] was the location of Lockheed's [[Skunk Works]], which produced some of the most secret and technologically advanced airplanes, including the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2 spy planes]]. The city contains the largest [[IKEA]] in the U.S.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 5, 2019 |title=The Largest IKEA in North America |url=https://visitburbank.com/blog/2019/04/largest-ikea-in-north-america/ |access-date=December 27, 2021 |website=Visit Burbank |language=en-US}}</ref>

==History==
=== Indigenous peoples and Spanish era ===
The history of the Burbank area can be traced back to the [[Tongva]] people, the indigenous people of the area, who lived in the region for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ogilvie |first=Jessica | url = https://laist.com/news/la-history/why-a-property-worth-millions-was-returned-to-tongva-tribe | title = Why A Property Worth Millions Was Returned To The Tongva Tribe | newspaper = laist.com work | date = October 10, 2022 | access-date = January 16, 2023 }}</ref><ref>{{cite map |author = larivermasterplan.org |title = Indigenous Villages |trans-title = Fernandeño Tataviam Villages Gabrielino Tongva Villages |map = Indigenous Villages |map-url = https://larivermasterplan.org/wp-content/uploads/24x36_Masterplan_IndigenousVillages.pdf|date = |year = 2019 |url = https://larivermasterplan.org/wp-content/uploads/24x36_Masterplan_IndigenousVillages.pdf |scale = 24x36 |series =

The city of Burbank occupies land that was previously part of two Spanish and Mexican-era colonial land grants: the {{convert|36400|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho San Rafael]], granted to [[Jose Maria Verdugo]] by the Spanish [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] government in 1784, and the {{convert|4063|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho Providencia]] created in 1821. This area was the scene of a military skirmish which resulted in the unseating of the Spanish Governor of California, and his replacement by the Mexican leader [[Pio Pico]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.militarymuseum.org/LaProvidencia.html | publisher = The California State Military Museum | title = Battle of La Providencia: Second Battle of Cahuenga Pass | access-date = January 4, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081026082407/http://www.militarymuseum.org/LaProvidencia.html | archive-date = October 26, 2008 | url-status = live }}</ref>

=== Mexican rancho era and early American era ===
New Spain achieved its independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821, and from 1824, [[Rancho San Rafael]] existed within the new Mexican Republic.

[[File:Dr David S Burbank portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[David Burbank]]]]
[[David Burbank]] purchased over {{convert|4600|acre|km2}} of the former Verdugo holding and another {{convert|4600|acre|km2}} of the Rancho Providencia in 1867. Burbank built a ranch house and began to raise sheep and grow wheat on the ranch.<ref name="Ref-1"/> By 1876, the [[San Fernando Valley]] became the largest wheat-raising area in [[Los Angeles County]]. But the droughts of the 1860s and 1870s underlined the need for steady water supplies.

[[File:Scott Tract Burbank.png|thumb|right|The Jonathan R. Scott tract, forming eastern Burbank along San Fernando Boulevard, called here the "Camino Real".]]
A professionally trained dentist, Burbank began his career in [[Waterville, Maine]]. He joined the great migration westward in the early 1850s and, by 1853 was living in [[San Francisco]]. At the time the [[American Civil War]] broke out, he was again well established in his profession as a dentist in [[Pueblo de Los Angeles]]. In 1867, he purchased Rancho La Providencia from [[David W. Alexander]] and [[Francis Mellus]], and he purchased the western portion of the Rancho San Rafael (4,603&nbsp;acres) from Jonathan R. Scott. Burbank's property reached nearly {{convert|9200|acre|km2}} at a cost of $9,000.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-then3jun03-story.html | title = What's in a name?

He eventually became known as one of the largest and most successful sheep raisers in southern California, and as a result, he closed his dentistry practice and invested heavily in real estate in Los Angeles.{{r|Ref-1}}

[[File:Burbank-1889.jpg|thumb|left|Olive Avenue in Burbank, 1889]]
When the area that became Burbank was settled in the 1870s and 1880s, the streets were aligned along what is now Olive Avenue, the road to the [[Cahuenga Pass]] and downtown Los Angeles. These were largely the roads the Native Americans traveled and the early settlers took their produce down to Los Angeles to sell and to buy supplies along these routes.

=== Railroad drives growth (1876–1888) ===
The arrival of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] in 1876, linking [[San Francisco]] and Los Angeles, marked a turning point for the [[San Fernando Valley]], including what would become Burbank. A shrewd businessman, Dr. Burbank sold a {{convert|100|foot||adj=mid|-wide}}, nearly {{convert|3|mile||adj=mid|-long|spell =in}} right-of-way to the railroad.<ref>{{ cite web |title=Burbank history timeline: Burbank in Focus |website=Burbank in Focus |access-date=2024-10-26 |url=https://burbankinfocus.org/node/22 }}</ref> This decision helped shape Burbank’s future, positioning it as a vital transportation and commerce hub within the Valley.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.americassuburb.com/timeline.html | title = Timeline of Valley history | work = The Valley Observed | first = Kevin | last = Roderick | date = November 24, 2005 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111121163451/http://www.americassuburb.com/timeline.html | archive-date = November 21, 2011 }}</ref> The first train passed through Burbank on April 5, 1874. A boom created by a rate war between the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]] and [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] brought people streaming into [[California]]. The first train passed through Burbank on April 5, 1874, and the influx of people soon followed, fueled by a rate war between the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific that drew newcomers into California. By 1886, a group of speculators had purchased much of Burbank's land holdings for $250,000, possibly due to a severe drought that had made it challenging to sustain his livestock, killing approximately 1,000 sheep due to the lack of water and grass that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wesclark.com/burbank/american_period.html |title=Chapter 2 – The American Period |access-date=January 15, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028072046/http://wesclark.com/burbank/american_period.html |archive-date=October 28, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wesclark.com/burbank/american_period.html |title=Chapter 2 – The American Period |access-date=January 15, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028072046/http://wesclark.com/burbank/american_period.html |archive-date=October 28, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> 

[[File:Providencialandwaterdevelopment.jpg|thumb|right|Burbank as envisioned by Providencia Land, Water & Development Co.]]

The group of speculators who bought the acreage formed the Providencia Land, Water, and Development Company and began developing the land, calling the new town Burbank after its founder, and began offering farm lots on May 1, 1887. The townsite had Burbank Boulevard/Walnut Avenue as the northern boundary, Grandview Avenue as the southern boundary, the edge of the Verdugo Mountains as the eastern boundary, and Clybourn Avenue as the western border.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.laconservancy.org/sites/default/files/community_documents/City%20of%20Burbank%20Citywide%20Historic%20Context%20Report,%202009.pdf |title=City of Burbank: Citywide Historic Context Report |date=September 2009 |access-date=October 4, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412182157/https://www.laconservancy.org/sites/default/files/community_documents/City%20of%20Burbank%20Citywide%20Historic%20Context%20Report,%202009.pdf |archive-date=April 12, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The establishment of a water system in 1887 allowed farmers to irrigate their orchards and provided a stronger base for agricultural development.<ref name="Ref-3">{{cite web | url = http://www.ci.burbank.ca.us/citymanager/history.htm | title = History of Burbank, California | publisher = City of Burbank | access-date = January 4, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090114115910/http://www.ci.burbank.ca.us/citymanager/history.htm | archive-date = January 14, 2009 | url-status = unfit }}</ref> The original plot of the new townsite of Burbank extended from what is now [[Burbank Boulevard]] on the north, to Grandview Avenue in [[Glendale, California]] on the south, and from the top of the Verdugo Hills on the east to what is now known as Clybourn Avenue on the west.{{r|Ref-1}}

At the same time, the arrival of the railroad provided immediate access for the farmers to bring crops to market. Packing houses and warehouses were built along the railroad corridors. The railroads also provided access to the county for tourists and immigrants alike. A Southern Pacific Railroad depot in Burbank was completed in 1887.

The boom lifting real estate values in the Los Angeles area proved to be a speculative frenzy that collapsed abruptly in 1889. Much of the newly created wealthy went broke. Many of the lots in Burbank ended up getting sold for taxes.{{r|Ref-1}} Vast numbers of people would leave the region before it all ended.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://file.lacounty.gov/lac/cms1_146766.pdf | title = The County of Los Angeles Annual Report, 2009–2010 | year = 2009 | access-date = August 1, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100527225405/http://file.lacounty.gov/lac/cms1_146766.pdf | archive-date = May 27, 2010 | url-status = live }}</ref> The effects of the downturn were felt for several years, as the economy struggled to recover and many businesses closed.

In August 1900, Burbank established its first telephone exchange, making it the first in the [[San Fernando Valley]]. Within five years, several other telephone exchanges were established in the Valley, and a company known as the San Fernando Valley Home Telephone Company was formed, based in Glendale.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://web.gc.cuny.edu/dept/arthi/part/part11/articles/bills.html | title = The Telephone Shapes Los Angeles, 1880–1950 | first = Emily | last = Bills | journal = PART | issue = 11 | year = 2004 | access-date = January 4, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090113190624/http://web.gc.cuny.edu/dept/arthi/part/part11/articles/bills.html | archive-date = January 13, 2009 | url-status = dead }}</ref> This company provided telephone service to the entire Valley, connecting communities and facilitating growth. Home Telephone competed with Tropico, and in 1918 both were taken over by Pacific Telephone Company. At this time, there were an estimated 300 hand-cranked telephones in Burbank. The telephone network helped to connect the sprawling metropolis of Los Angeles and its surrounding areas such as Burbank, making it easier for people to move around and do business.

By 1904, Burbank gained worldwide recognition when the renowned heavyweight boxing champion [[James J. Jeffries]] became a significant landowner in the town. Jeffries acquired  {{convert|107|acres|km2}} of land along Victory Boulevard to establish his ranch. He ventured into cattle farming and exported his livestock to Mexico and South America, becoming one of the pioneering residents to participate in foreign trade. Eventually, he constructed a sizable ranch house and barn near the present-day intersection of [[Victory Boulevard (Los Angeles)|Victory Boulevard]] and Buena Vista Street. Subsequently, the barn was relocated and reconstructed at [[Knott's Berry Farm]] in [[Buena Park, California]].{{r|Ref-1}}

The town's first bank was formed in 1908 when Burbank State Bank opened its doors near the corner of Olive Avenue and San Fernando Blvd. On the first day, the bank collected $30,000 worth of deposits, and at the time the town had a population of 300 residents.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ira Brown Cross|title=Financing an Empire: History of Banking in California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2XBEAAAAIAAJ|year=1927|publisher=S.

In 1911, wealthy farmer Joseph Fawkes grew apricots and owned a house on West Olive Avenue. He was also fascinated with machinery, and soon began developing what became known as the "Fawkes Folly" aerial trolley.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/tf8779p41q/ | title = Aerial Trolley Car Co., Inc.

Joseph Fawkes called the trolley his Aerial Swallow, a cigar-shaped, suspended monorail driven by a propeller that he promised would carry passengers from Burbank to downtown Los Angeles in 10&nbsp;minutes. The first open car accommodated about 20 passengers and was suspended from an overhead track and supported by wooden beams. In 1911, the monorail car made its first and only run through his Burbank ranch, with a line between Lake and Flower Streets. The monorail was considered a failure after gliding just a foot or so and falling to pieces. Nobody was injured but Joseph Fawkes' pride was badly hurt as Aerial Swallow became known as "Fawkes' Folly." City officials viewed his test run as a failure and focused on getting a Pacific Electric Streetcar line into Burbank.<ref name="coscia">{{cite book| author=Coscia, David| title=Pacific Electric and the Growth of the San Fernando Valley |year= 2011|publisher=Shade Tree Books |location=Bellflower, CA| isbn =978-1-57864-735-4}}</ref>

Laid out and surveyed with a modern business district surrounded by residential lots, wide boulevards were carved out as the "Los Angeles Express" printed:
<blockquote>
Burbank, the town, being built in the midst of the new farming community, has been laid out in such a manner as to make it by and by an unusually pretty town. The streets and avenues are wide and, all have been handsomely graded. All improvements being made would do credit to a city&nbsp;... Everything done at Burbank has been done right.
</blockquote>

The citizens of Burbank had to put up a $48,000 subsidy to get the reluctant Pacific Electric Streetcar officials to agree to extend the line from Glendale to Burbank.<ref name="Ref-3" /> The first Red Car rolled into Burbank on September 6, 1911, with a tremendous celebration. That was about two months after the town became a city. The "Burbank Review" newspaper ran a special edition that day<ref name="Ref-4"/> advising all local residents that:
<blockquote>
On Wednesday, the first electric car running on a regular passenger-carrying schedule left the Pacific Electric station at Sixth and Main streets, Los Angeles, for Burbank at 6:30&nbsp;a.m. and the first car from Burbank to Los Angeles left at 6:20&nbsp;a.m. the same day. Upon arrival of this car on its maiden trip, many citizens gave evidence of their great joy by ringing bells and discharging firearms. A big crowd of both men and women boarded the first car and rode to Glendale and there changed to a second car coming from Los Angeles and rode home again. Every face was an expression of happiness and satisfaction.
</blockquote>

The Burbank Line was completed through to Cypress Avenue in Burbank, and by mid-1925 this line was extended about a mile further along Glenoaks Boulevard to Eton Drive. A small wooden station was erected in Burbank in 1911 at Orange Grove Avenue with a small storage yard in its rear. This depot was destroyed by fire in 1942 and in 1947 a small passenger shelter was constructed.

On May 26, 1942, the California State Railroad Commission proposed an extension of the Burbank Line to the Lockheed plant.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.erha.org/pewgb.htm | publisher = The Electric Railway Historical Association of Southern California | title = Pacific Electric Glendale-Burbank Line | access-date = January 4, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090114163234/http://www.erha.org/pewgb.htm | archive-date = January 14, 2009 | url-status = live }}</ref> The proposal called for a double-track line from Arden Junction along Glenoaks to San Fernando Boulevard and Empire Way, just northeast of Lockheed's main facility. But this extension never materialized and the commission moved on to other projects in the San Fernando Valley. The Red Car line in Burbank was abandoned and the tracks removed in 1956.

In 1923, Burbank transitioned from a marshal’s office to a police department. The early department consisted of only a handful of officers who were responsible for maintaining law and order in a rapidly growing community. The first police chief was George Cole, who later became a U.S. Treasury prohibition officer. Through the decades, the department has grown and evolved, adapting to the changing needs of the city. Today, the Burbank Police Department is a well-respected agency, known for its professionalism and commitment to serving the community. The department has a diverse range of specialized units, including a SWAT team, K-9 unit, air support, and a detective bureau.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.burbankpd.org/inside-bpd/history-of-burbank-police-department/#:~:text=Law%20enforcement%20presence%20in%20Burbank,change%20in%20the%20city%20charter. | publisher = Burbank Police Department | title = History of Burbank Police Department | access-date = January 16, 2023 }}</ref>

In 1928, Burbank was one of the first 13 cities to join the [[Metropolitan Water District of Southern California]], one of the largest suppliers of water in the world. This contrasted with other [[San Fernando Valley]] communities that obtained water through political annexation to Los Angeles. By 1937, the first power from [[Hoover Dam]] was distributed over Burbank's own electricity lines.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.burbankwaterandpower.net/the-history-of-burbank-water-and-power | title = The History of Burbank Water and Power | work = Burbank Water and Power | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110723033518/http://www.burbankwaterandpower.net/the-history-of-burbank-water-and-power | archive-date = July 23, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The city purchases about 55% of its water from the MWD.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cadelago |first1=Christopher |title=Service fees may rise soon |url=http://burbankleader.com/articles/2009/05/20/politics/blr-utilities16.txt |access-date=June 14, 2020 |work=[[Burbank Leader]] |date=May 18, 2009 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120718060144/http://articles.burbankleader.com/2009-05-18/news/blr-utilities16_1_electric-rates-rate-increase-rationing-plan |archive-date=July 18, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>{{cbignore|bot=InternetArchiveBot}}

===City of Burbank===
[[File:Burbank-1922.jpg|thumb|right|Burbank, 1922]]
[[File:CA 4 I5 NARA 1960 66.jpg|thumb|right|Golden State Freeway/Interstate 5 under construction through Burbank, 1959]]
The town grew steadily, weathering the [[drought]] and [[Depression (economics)|depression]] that hit [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in the 1890s and in 20 years, the community had a [[bank]], newspaper, [[High school (North America)|high school]] and a thriving business district with a hardware store, livery stable, [[dry goods]] store, general store, and bicycle repair shop. The city's first newspaper, ''Burbank Review'', was established in 1906.

The populace petitioned the [[California State Legislature|State Legislature]] to [[Municipal corporation|incorporate as a city]] on July 8, 1911, with businessman Thomas Story as the [[mayor]]. Voters approved incorporation by a vote of 81 to 51. At the time, the Board of Trustees governed the community which numbered 500 residents. With the action of the Legislature, Burbank thus became the first independent city in the San Fernando Valley.

The establishment of Burbank as a city was a crucial milestone in the area's progress, triggering a fresh phase of growth and advancement. This cityhood meant that Burbank gained the ability to govern itself, making decisions independently regarding its development and expansion. It also granted the city greater authority over its valuable resources, such as land, water, and other assets. With this newfound control, Burbank could shape its own future and manage its local affairs more effectively.

The first city seal adopted by Burbank featured a [[cantaloupe]], which was a crop that helped save the town's life when the land boom collapsed.<ref name="Ref-4" /> In 1931, the original city seal was replaced and in 1978 the modern seal was adopted. The new seal shows City Hall beneath a banner. An airplane symbolizes the city's aircraft industry, the strip of film and stage light represent motion picture production. The bottom portion depicts the sun rising over the Verdugo Mountains.

In 1915, major sections of the Valley were annexed, helping [[Los Angeles]] to more than double its size that year. But Burbank was among a handful of towns with their own water wells and remained independent. By 1916, Burbank had 1,500 residents. In 1922, the Burbank Chamber of Commerce was organized. In 1923, the [[United States Postal Service]] reclassified the city from the rural ''village mail delivery'' to ''city postal delivery service''.<ref name="Ref-4" /> Burbank's population had grown significantly, from less than 500 people in 1908 to over 3,000 citizens. The city's business district grew on the west side of San Fernando Blvd. and stretched from Verdugo to Cypress avenues, and on the east side to Palm Avenue. In 1927, five miles (8&nbsp;km) of paved streets had increased to {{convert|125|mi|km}}.

The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] set off a period of hardship for Burbank where business and residential growth paused. The effects of the Depression also caused tight credit conditions and halted home building throughout the area, including the city's Magnolia Park development. Around this time, major employers began to cut payrolls and some plants closed their doors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digital-library.csun.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/SFVH&CISOPTR=1713&DMSCALE=100&DMWIDTH=600&DMHEIGHT=600&DMX=782&DMY=134&DMMODE=viewer&DMTEXT=%20Burbank&REC=19&DMTHUMB=1&DMROTATE=0 |title=CONTENTdm Collection: Item Viewer |publisher=Digital-library.csun.edu |access-date=December 19, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929213805/http://digital-library.csun.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=%2FSFVH&CISOPTR=1713&DMSCALE=100&DMWIDTH=600&DMHEIGHT=600&DMX=782&DMY=134&DMMODE=viewer&DMTEXT=%20Burbank&REC=19&DMTHUMB=1&DMROTATE=0 |archive-date=September 29, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

The Burbank City Council responded by slashing 10% of the wages of city workers. Money was put into an Employee Relief Department to help the unemployed. Local civic and religious groups sprang into action and contributed with food as homeless camps began to form along the city's Southern Pacific railroad tracks. Hundreds began to participate in self-help cooperatives, trading skills such as barbering, tailoring, plumbing or carpentry, for food and other services.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digital-library.csun.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=%2FSFVH&CISOPTR=1704&DMSCALE=100&DMWIDTH=600&DMHEIGHT=600&DMMODE=viewer&DMFULL=1&DMX=170&DMY=0&DMTEXT=%2520Burbank&DMTHUMB=1&REC=20&DMROTATE=0&x=74&y=503 |title=CONTENTdm Collection: Item Viewer |publisher=Digital-library.csun.edu |access-date=December 19, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929213810/http://digital-library.csun.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=%2FSFVH&CISOPTR=1704&DMSCALE=100&DMWIDTH=600&DMHEIGHT=600&DMMODE=viewer&DMFULL=1&DMX=170&DMY=0&DMTEXT=%20Burbank&DMTHUMB=1&REC=20&DMROTATE=0&x=74&y=503 |archive-date=September 29, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

By 1930, as [[First National Pictures|First National Studios]], [[Andrew Jergens Company]], The [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed Company]], [[Libby's|McNeill and Libby Canning Company]], the Moreland Company, and [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop Aircraft Corporation]] opened facilities in Burbank and the population jumped to 16,662.

In the 1930s, Burbank and [[Glendale, California|Glendale]] prevented the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] from stationing African American workers in a local park, citing [[sundown town]] ordinances that both cities had adopted.<ref>{{cite book|first=James W.|last=Loewen|author-link=James W.

Following a San Fernando Valley land bust during the Depression, real estate began to bounce back in the mid-1930s. In Burbank, a 100-home construction project began in 1934. By 1936, property values in the city exceeded pre-Depression levels. By 1950, the population had reached 78,577.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.laalmanac.com/population/po26.htm | title = General Population By City: Los Angeles County, 1910–1950 | work = Los Angeles Almanac | access-date = January 4, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080922162229/http://www.laalmanac.com/population/po26.htm | archive-date = September 22, 2008 | url-status = live }}</ref> From 1967 to 1989, a six-block stretch of San Fernando Blvd. was pedestrianized as the "[[Golden Mall]]".

===Early manufacturing===
In 1887, the Burbank Furniture Manufacturing Company was the town's first factory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digital-library.csun.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/SFVH&CISOPTR=4183 |title=Burbank Furniture Manufacturing Company, 1887 |work=Oviatt Library Digital Collections |access-date=February 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225125934/http://digital-library.csun.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=%2FSFVH&CISOPTR=4183 |archive-date=February 25, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1917, the arrival of the [[Moreland Motor Truck Company]] changed the town and resulted in growing a manufacturing and industrial workforce. Within a few years, Moreland trucks were seen bearing the label, "Made in Burbank."<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.ci.burbank.ca.us/citymanager/PDF/Section%20G.pdf |title=City of Burbank Strategic Plan 2001–2010 |chapter=Fiscally Responsible City Governance}}</ref> Watt Moreland, its owner, had relocated his plant to Burbank from Los Angeles. He selected {{convert|25|acre|m2}} at San Fernando Blvd. and Alameda Avenue. Moreland invested $1 million in the factory and machinery and employed 500 people. It was the largest truck maker west of the Mississippi.{{Citation needed|date=December 2021}}

[[File:morelandtruck.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Moreland Motor Truck Company]] in Burbank]]
Within the next several decades, factories would dot the area landscape. What had mainly been an agricultural and ranching area would get replaced with a variety of manufacturing industries. Moreland operated from 1917 to 1937. Aerospace supplier Menasco Manufacturing Company would later purchase the property. Menasco's Burbank landing gear factory closed in 1994 due to slow commercial and military orders, affecting 310 people. Within months of Moreland's arrival, Community Manufacturing Company, a $3 million tractor company, arrived in Burbank.{{Citation needed|date=December 2021}}

In 1920, the Andrew Jergens Company factory opened at Verdugo Avenue near the railroad tracks in Burbank. Andrew Jergens Jr.—aided by his father, Cincinnati businessman Andrew Jergens Sr. and business partners Frank Adams and Morris Spazier—had purchased the site and built a single-story building. They began with a single product, coconut oil soap, but would later make face creams, lotions, liquid soaps, and deodorants. In 1931, despite the Depression, the Jergens company expanded, building new offices and shipping department facilities. In 1939, the Burbank corporation merged with the Cincinnati company of Andrew Jergens Sr. becoming known as the Andrew Jergens Company of Ohio. The Burbank plant closed in 1992, affecting nearly 90 employees.{{Citation needed|date=December 2021}}

The establishment of the aircraft industry and a major airport in Burbank during the 1930s set the stage for major growth and development, which was to continue at an accelerated pace into [[World War II]] and well into the postwar era. Brothers [[Allan Loughead]] and [[Malcolm Loughead]], founders of the [[Lockheed Aircraft Company]], opened a Burbank manufacturing plant in 1928 and, a year later, aviation designer [[Jack Northrop]] built his Flying Wing airplane in his own plant nearby.<ref>Parker, Dana T.

[[File:WWII Woman aircraft inspector checking electrical assemblies, Vega Aircraft Corporation, Burbank, California in June 1942.jpg|thumb|Woman aircraft inspector checking electrical assemblies, Vega Aircraft Corporation, Burbank (June 1942)]]
Dedicated on [[Memorial Day]] Weekend (May 30 – June 1), 1930, the [[Bob Hope Airport|United Airport]] was the largest commercial airport in the Los Angeles area until it was eclipsed in 1946 by the [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles Municipal Airport]] (now [[Los Angeles International Airport]]) in [[Westchester, Los Angeles, California|Westchester]] when that facility (the former ''Mines Field'') commenced commercial operations. [[Amelia Earhart]], [[Wiley Post]] and [[Howard Hughes]] were among the notable [[aviation pioneers]] to pilot aircraft in and out of the original Union Air Terminal. By 1935, Union Air Terminal in Burbank ranked as the third-largest air terminal in the nation, with 46 airliners flying out of it daily. The airport served 9,895 passengers in 1931 and 98,485 passengers in 1936.

In 1931, Lockheed was then part of Detroit Aircraft Corp., which went into bankruptcy with its Lockheed unit. A year later, a group of investors acquired assets of the Lockheed company. The new owners staked their limited funds to develop an all-metal, twin-engine transport, the Model 10 Electra. It first flew in 1934 and quickly gained worldwide notice.<ref>Parker, Dana T. ''Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II,'' p. 59, Cypress, CA, 2013. {{ISBN|978-0-9897906-0-4}}.</ref>

A brochure celebrating Burbank's 50th anniversary as a city touted Lockheed payroll having "nearly 1,200" by the end of 1936. The aircraft company's hiring contributed to what was a favorable employment environment at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digital-library.csun.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=%2FSFVH&CISOPTR=1713&DMSCALE=100&DMWIDTH=600&DMHEIGHT=600&DMMODE=viewer&DMFULL=1&DMX=235&DMY=40&DMTEXT=%2520Burbank&DMTHUMB=1&REC=19&x=16&y=101&DMROTATE=0 |title=CONTENTdm Collection: Item Viewer |publisher=Digital-library.csun.edu |access-date=December 19, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929213756/http://digital-library.csun.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=%2FSFVH&CISOPTR=1713&DMSCALE=100&DMWIDTH=600&DMHEIGHT=600&DMMODE=viewer&DMFULL=1&DMX=235&DMY=40&DMTEXT=%20Burbank&DMTHUMB=1&REC=19&x=16&y=101&DMROTATE=0 |archive-date=September 29, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

Moreland's truck plant was later used by Lockheed's Vega Aircraft Corporation, which made what was widely known as "the explorer's aircraft." [[Amelia Earhart]] flew one across the Atlantic Ocean. In 1936, Lockheed officially took over Vega Aircraft in Burbank.<ref>Herman, Arthur.

The growth of companies such as Lockheed, and the burgeoning entertainment industry drew more people to the area, and Burbank's population doubled between 1930 and 1940 to 34,337. Burbank saw its greatest growth during [[World War II]] due to [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed's]] presence, employing some 80,800 men and women producing aircraft such as the [[Lockheed Hudson]], [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]], [[Lockheed Ventura|Lockheed PV-1 Ventura]], [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]], and America's first [[Jet engine|jet]] fighter, the [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star]].<ref>Herman, Arthur.

Dozens of hamburger stands, restaurants and shops appeared around Lockheed to accommodate the employees. Some of the restaurants operated 24 hours a day. At one time, Lockheed paid utility rates representing 25% of the city's total utilities revenue, making Lockheed the city's cash cow. When Lockheed left, the economic loss was huge. At its height during [[World War II]], the Lockheed facility employed up to 98,000 people.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.burbankchamber.org/html/demographics.asp | title = Demographics | publisher = The Burbank Chamber of Commerce | access-date = January 4, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090110184240/http://www.burbankchamber.org/html/demographics.asp | archive-date = January 10, 2009 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Between the Lockheed and Vega plants, some {{convert|7700000|sqft|m2}} of manufacturing space was located in Burbank at the peak in 1943.

Real estate values soared as housing tracts appeared in the Magnolia Park area of Burbank between 1945 and 1950. More than 62% of the city's housing stock was built before 1970.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|title=Profile of the City of Burbank|url=http://www.scag.ca.gov/Documents/Burbank.pdf|page=16|access-date=January 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122202328/http://www.scag.ca.gov/Documents/Burbank.pdf|archive-date=January 22, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Following [[World War II]], homeless veterans lived in tent camps in Burbank, in Big Tujunga Canyon and at a decommissioned National Guard base in [[Griffith Park]]. The government also set up trailer camps at Hollywood Way and Winona Avenue in Burbank and in nearby [[Sun Valley, California|Sun Valley]]. But new homes were built, the economy improved, and the military presence in Burbank continued to expand. Lockheed employees numbered 66,500 and expanded from aircraft to include spacecraft, missiles, electronics and shipbuilding.

Burbank was also where the prototypes for the JetStar corporate transport and [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] cargo carrier first took flight, and where the concepts for the [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]] jetliner and [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk]] stealth fighter were developed.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://digital-collections.csun.edu/digital/collection/SFVH/id/4095/rec/53 | title = A Lockheed Farewell to Burbank | work = The Lockheed Star | first = Sol | last = London | date = October 30, 2024 | access-date = October 30, 2024 | publisher = CSUN Digital Collection }}</ref>

Lockheed's presence in Burbank attracted dozens of firms making aircraft parts. One of them was [[Weber Aircraft LLC|Weber Aircraft Corporation]], an aircraft interior manufacturer situated adjacent to Lockheed at the edge of the airport. Throughout the 1950s and into the late 1960s, Weber Aircraft became a leading supplier of seats for a variety of aircraft, including the [[Boeing 707]], the [[Douglas DC-8]], and the [[Lockheed L-1011]]. In 1988, Weber closed its Burbank manufacturing plant, which then employed 1,000 people. Weber produced seats, galleys, lavatories and other equipment for commercial and military aircraft. Weber had been in Burbank for 36 years.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-09-15-fi-8025-story.html | title = Airport's fares are 3rd-lowest Wage Cut or Doors Shut: Burbank's Weber Aircraft Factory Issues an Ultimatum to Hundreds of Union Workers| work = Los Angeles Times | first = James | last = Peltz | date = September 15, 1987 | access-date = January 16, 2023 }}</ref>

In 1987, Burbank's airport became the first to require flight carriers to fly quieter "Stage 3" jets. By 2010, Burbank's [[Bob Hope Airport]] had 4.5 million passengers annually. The airport also was a major facility for [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], with 96.2 million pounds of cargo that year.<ref>[http://www.burbankairport.com/airportauthority/about-airport/airport-facts.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403072220/http://www.burbankairport.com/airportauthority/about-airport/airport-facts.html|date=April 3, 2012}}</ref>

===Entertainment industry===
[[File:Warner Music Group (1).jpg|thumb|right|[[Warner Music Group]] offices in Burbank]]

The [[Cinema of the United States|motion picture business]] arrived in Burbank in the 1920s. In 1926, [[First National Pictures]] bought a {{convert|78|acre|m2|adj=on}} site on Olive Avenue near Dark Canyon. The property included a {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} hog ranch and the original David Burbank house, both owned by rancher Stephen A. Martin.

In 1928, First National was taken over by a company founded by the four [[Warner Brothers]]. Notably, First National had produced and released many of the early "talkie" films of the late 1920s. By 1929, Warner Bros.-First National Pictures was dissolved and the First National name was retired. However, Warner Bros. continued to operate on the site as a standalone studio.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Birth of the Talkies - From Edison to Jolson | publisher= Indiana University Press | location=Bloomington, Indiana | last=Geduld |first=Harry |author-link1=Harry M.

[[Columbia Pictures]] purchased property in Burbank as a ranch facility, used primarily for outdoor shooting. [[Walt Disney]]'s company, which had outgrown its Hollywood quarters after success of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)]]'', bought {{convert|51|acre|m2}} in Burbank. [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Disney's million-dollar studio]], designed by [[Kem Weber]], was completed in 1939 on Buena Vista Street. Disney originally wanted to build "Mickey Mouse Park," as he first called it, next to the Burbank studio. But his aides finally convinced him that the space was too small, and there was opposition from the Burbank City Council. One council member told Disney: "We don't want the carny atmosphere in Burbank." Disney later built his successful [[Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim]].

====Wartime effort====
During World War II, many of the movie studios in Burbank were used for war-related production, including civil defense-related films, and the city experienced a population boom as a result of the increased job opportunities. From Disney Studios alone, more than 70 hours of film was produced during the wartime effort. This included films that were used to boost morale on the home front and others that were used to educate and inform the public about the war.<ref>{{cite web |title=Military History Museum |date=May 9, 2021 |publisher=the-past.com |url=https://the-past.com/review/museum/disney-goes-to-war/ |access-date=January 15, 2023 }}</ref> Burbank, which was previously known primarily as a center of the entertainment industry, became a major player in the war effort and a thriving community as a result. As the war came to an end, the movie studios in Burbank returned to their primary function of producing entertainment films, but the city had permanently changed as a result of its wartime experience.

====Labor strife====
Burbank saw its first real civil strife as the culmination of a six-month [[Strike action|labor dispute]] between the [[set decorator]]'s union and the [[movie studio|studios]] resulted in the [[Battle of Burbank]] on October 5, 1945, a confrontation that led to the [[Strike wave of 1945–46|largest wave of strikes in American history]]. For six months, the union had been negotiating for better pay and working conditions, but the studios refused to budge. Frustrated and desperate, the set decorators decided to take action. The studios responded by hiring non-union workers to replace the striking decorators, but the union was not about to back down. They organized picket lines and rallies, drawing support from other unions in the area.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-09-10/the-last-time-it-involved-the-mob-and-warner-bros-could-iatse-strike-again |title=The War for Warner Brothers |work=iatse728.com |date=September 10, 2021 |access-date=January 16, 2023 }}</ref> The studios, in turn, called in police and private security to break up the protests. Streets were filled with striking workers, non-union replacements, and security personnel, all engaged in a violent confrontation. Cars were overturned, windows were smashed, and tear gas was used to disperse the crowds. In the end, studios forced to negotiate with the union, and the decorators eventually won their demands for better pay and working conditions.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-09-10/the-last-time-it-involved-the-mob-and-warner-bros-could-iatse-strike-again |title=The last time it was 'Hollywood's Bloody Friday.'

====Hub of Hollywood====
By the 1960s and 1970s, more of the Hollywood entertainment industry was relocating to Burbank. [[NBC]] moved its west coast headquarters to a new location at Olive and Alameda avenues. The Burbank studio was purchased in 1951, and NBC arrived in 1952 from its former location at Sunset and Vine in Hollywood. Although NBC promoted its Hollywood image for most of its West Coast telecasts (such as [[Ed McMahon]]'s introduction to ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'': "from Hollywood"), comedians [[Dan Rowan]] and [[Dick Martin (comedian)|Dick Martin]] began mentioning "beautiful downtown Burbank" on ''[[Laugh-in]]'' in the 1960s. By 1962, NBC's [[The Burbank Studios|multimillion-dollar, state-of-the-art complex]] was completed.

One of the biggest productions to come out of the Burbank studios during this time was the hit television series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]''. The show, which aired from 1966 to 1968, was filmed entirely on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank and was a huge success, both critically and commercially. It was instrumental in launching other superhero shows and movies, and its popularity helped to establish the studio as a major player in the television industry. As the 1970s came to a close, the Burbank studios had firmly established themselves as a major player in the industry.

====Studio Corridor====
Warner Bros., NBC, Disney and Columbia TriStar Home Video (now [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]) all ended up located very close to each other along the southern edge of Burbank (and not far from Universal City to the southwest), an area now known as the Media District,<ref name="MediaDistrict">{{cite web|last=City of Burbank Community Development Department|title=The Burbank Media District Specific Plan|url=http://www.burbankca.gov/home/showdocument?id=2625|access-date=April 16, 2014|date=January 8, 1991|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416210919/http://www.burbankca.gov/home/showdocument?id=2625|archive-date=April 16, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Media Center District or simply Media Center.<ref>{{cite web | title = Burbank Media Center | publisher = Burbank.com | url = http://www.burbank.com/story/Burbank-Media-Center/78189 | access-date = March 10, 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140310072423/http://www.burbank.com/story/Burbank-Media-Center/78189 | archive-date = March 10, 2014 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref> In the early 1990s, Burbank imposed growth restrictions in the Media District.<ref name="MediaDistrict" /> Since then, to house its growing workforce, Disney has focused on developing the site of the former [[Grand Central Airport (United States)|Grand Central Airport]] in the nearby city of Glendale. Only Disney's most senior executives and some film, television, and animation operations are still based at the main Disney studio lot in Burbank.

Rumors surfaced of NBC leaving Burbank after its parent company [[General Electric Corporation]] acquired [[Universal Studios]] and renamed the merged division [[NBCUniversal|NBC Universal]]. Since the deal, NBC has been relocating key operations to the Universal property located in [[Universal City, Los Angeles, California|Universal City]]. In 2007, NBC Universal management informed employees that the company planned to sell much of the Burbank complex. NBC Universal would relocate its television and cable operations to the Universal City complex.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.dailynews.com/search/ci_13463331 | title = Universal Studios to get $3 billion NBC makeover | work = [[Los Angeles Daily News]] | first = Dana | last = Bartholomew | date = October 7, 2009 | access-date = October 9, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110621233019/http://www.dailynews.com/search/ci_13463331 | archive-date = June 21, 2011 | url-status = live }}</ref> When [[Conan O'Brien]] took over hosting ''The Tonight Show'' from Carson's successor [[Jay Leno]] in 2009, he hosted the show from Universal City.

The relocation plans changed following [[Comcast]] Corp.'s $30 billion acquisition of NBC Universal in January 2011. NBC Universal announced in January 2012 it would relocate the NBC Network, [[Telemundo]]'s L.A. Bureau, as well as local stations [[KNBC]] and [[KVEA]] to the former Technicolor building located on the lower lot of Universal Studios in Universal City.<ref>{{cite news |author=Jacquelyn Ryan |url=http://www.labusinessjournal.com/news/2012/jan/04/nbcs-big-metrostudios-project-killed/ |title=NBC's Big MetroStudios Project Killed, Smaller Facility Planned |newspaper=Los Angeles Business Journal |date=January 4, 2012 |access-date=August 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524070914/http://www.labusinessjournal.com/news/2012/jan/04/nbcs-big-metrostudios-project-killed/ |archive-date=May 24, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The former NBC Studios were renamed [[The Burbank Studios]].

In 2019, the Conan O'Brien moved his [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] talk show, ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'', to Stage 15 on the Warner Bros. studios lot in Burbank, where it continued to tape until 2021 when the show ended.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100520023832/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/05/16/conan-obrien-to-shoot-new-talk-show-on-warner-bros-tv-lot/ Conan O'Brien to shoot TBS talk show on Warner Bros.

In the early 1990s, Burbank tried unsuccessfully to lure [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]], the Columbia and [[TriStar Pictures|TriStar]] studios owner based in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]], and [[20th Century Fox]], which had threatened to move from its West Los Angeles lot unless the city granted permission to upgrade its facility. Fox stayed after getting Los Angeles city approval on its $200 million expansion plan. In 1999, the city managed to gain [[Cartoon Network Studios]] which took up residence in an old commercial bakery building located on North 3rd St. when it separated its production operations from [[Warner Bros. Animation]] in [[Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles|Sherman Oaks]].

===Cinema history===
Hundreds of major feature films have been filmed in the studios in Burbank including ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942), starring [[Humphrey Bogart]].<ref name="Ref-5">{{cite web | url = http://movies.toptenreviews.com/list-california-burbank.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090113183708/http://movies.toptenreviews.com/list-california-burbank.htm | url-status = dead | archive-date = January 13, 2009 | title = Top Movies Filmed in Burbank, California | work = [[TopTenReviews.com]] }}</ref> The movie began production a few months after the Japanese bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]]. Due to World War II, location shooting was restricted and filming near airports was banned. As a result, ''Casablanca'' shot most of its major scenes on Stage 1 at the Warner Bros. Burbank Studios, including the film's airport scene. It featured a foggy Moroccan runway created on the stage where Bogart's character does not fly away with [[Ingrid Bergman]]. ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' (1967) was also filmed at the Warner Bros. Burbank Studios.

The [[Gary Cooper]] film ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952) was shot on a western street at the [[Movie ranch#Warner Brothers "Ranch"|Warner Brothers "Ranch"]], then known as the Columbia Ranch.<ref name="Ref-5" /> The ranch facility is situated less than a mile north of Warner's main lot in Burbank. ''[[3:10 to Yuma (1957 film)|3:10 to Yuma]]'' (1957) was also filmed on the old Columbia Ranch, and much of the outdoor filming for the [[Three Stooges]] took place at Columbia Ranch, including most of the chase scenes. In 1993, Warner Bros. bulldozed the Burbank-based sets used to film ''[[High Noon]]'' and Lee Marvin's Oscar-winning Western comedy ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' (1965), as well as several other features and television shows. A $500-million redevelopment of the Warner Bros. Ranch Lot is currently underway,  which will add new offices and soundstages to the historic production facility.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sharp |first1=Steven|website=Los Angeles Times |url = https://la.urbanize.city/post/500m-development-transform-historic-warner-bros-ranch-burbank | title = $500M development to transform historic Warner Bros.

While filming ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'' (1995) and ''[[Coach Carter]]'' (2005), the producers shot scenes at Burbank's Safari Inn Motel. ''[[True Romance]]'' (1993) also filmed on location at the motel. ''[[Back to the Future]]'' (1985) shot extensively on the Universal Studios backlot but also filmed band audition scenes at the Burbank Community Center. San Fernando Blvd. doubled for [[San Diego]] in ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'' (1997) while much of [[Christopher Nolan]]'s ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' was shot in and around Burbank with scenes on Burbank Blvd., at the Blue Room (a local bar also featured in the 1994 [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]] feature ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]''), the tattoo parlor, as well as the character Natalie's home.

The city's indoor shopping mall, [[Burbank Town Center]], is often used as a backdrop for shooting films, television series and commercials. Over the years, it was the site for scenes in ''[[Bad News Bears]]'' (2005) to location shooting for ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]],'' ''[[Gilmore Girls]],'' ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' and ''[[Desperate Housewives]].''<ref>{{cite web | url = http://retailtrafficmag.com/mag/retail_mall_coming_theater/ | title = The Mall Coming To A Theater Near You | date = May 1, 2007 | first = Mike | last = Janssen | work = Retail Traffic | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202233515/http://retailtrafficmag.com/mag/retail_mall_coming_theater/ | archive-date = December 2, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The ABC show ''Desperate Housewives'' also frequently used the Magnolia Park area for show scenes, along with the city's retail district along Riverside and adjacent to [[Toluca Lake, California]].

The Burbank Airport is also an important part of the city's cinematic history. In the early days of Hollywood, many stars and filmmakers used the airport to travel to and from Los Angeles. The airport has also been featured in a number of films and television shows over the years, including ''[[The Hindenburg (film)]]'', ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)]]'', and ''[[Perry Mason (1957 TV series)]]''.

In 2012, an international filmmaking and acting academy opened its doors in Burbank. The school, the International Academy of Film and Television, traces its roots to the Philippines. The first class will include students from 30 countries.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kellam |first=Mark |url=http://www.burbankleader.com/entertainment/tn-blr-0505-show-biz-school-opens-in-burbank,0,5245396.story |title=Filmmaking and acting school opens in Burbank, California |publisher=Burbank Leader |date=May 5, 2012 |access-date=August 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617203542/http://www.burbankleader.com/entertainment/tn-blr-0505-show-biz-school-opens-in-burbank,0,5245396.story |archive-date=June 17, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Burbank, like other cities in California, has been facing many economic, political and social challenges in recent years. One of the main issues is the lack of affordable housing in the city. The cost of single-family homes in Burbank topped $1 million by early 2021.<ref>{{cite web |last=Leonard|first=Christian |url=https://burbankleader.outlooknewspapers.com/2021/12/04/home-prices-keep-climbing/ |title=Home Prices Keep Climbing |publisher=Burbank Leader |date=December 4, 2021 |access-date=January 16, 2023 }}</ref> According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the average rent price in Burbank is around $1,800 and 29% of Burbank residents spend over half of their income on rent.<ref>{{cite web |last=Quentin |first=Gavin |url=https://burbankleader.outlooknewspapers.com/2022/08/30/governor-signs-portantino-bill-creating-regional-affordable-housing-trust/ |title=Governor Signs Portantino Bill Creating Regional Affordable Housing Trust |publisher=Burbank Leader |date=August 30, 2022 |access-date=January 16, 2023 }}</ref> These high housing costs are putting a strain on many residents, and as a result, a rent-control ordinance known as Measure RC was put on the ballot in 2021 to cap rent increases at 7% annually on at least 24,000 residential units; the measure failed to pass 36 to 64%.<ref>{{cite web |title=November 3, 2020 Measure RC - Summary |url=https://www.burbankca.gov/web/city-clerks-office/measure-rc |website=City of Burbank - City Clerk's Office |access-date=January 16, 2023}}</ref> California law bars communities in the state from putting rent control on complexes built after February 1995.

Since 2007, Burbank has prohibited smoking at all city-owned properties, downtown Burbank, the Chandler Bikeway, and sidewalk and pedestrian areas.<ref>{{cite web |last=Meier |first=Gretchen |url=http://www.burbankleader.com/news/tn-blr-smoking-20101002,0,7283614.story |title=Smoking law gets tougher again |publisher=Burbank Leader |date=October 2, 2010 |access-date=December 19, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124214147/http://www.burbankleader.com/news/tn-blr-smoking-20101002,0,7283614.story |archive-date=November 24, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The murder of Burbank police officer Matthew Pavelka in 2003 by a local gang known as the Vineland Boys sparked an intensive investigation in conjunction with several other cities and resulted in the arrest of a number of gang members and other citizens in and around Burbank. Among those arrested was Burbank councilwoman Stacey Murphy, implicated in trading guns in exchange for drugs.<ref>{{cite news | last = Lee | first = Wendy | title = Burbank Official Arrested in Gang Probe | work =[[Los Angeles Times]] | location = Los Angeles, Calif. | date = July 15, 2005 | page = B.1 | url = https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-jul-15-me-burbank15-story.html | access-date = August 12, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121024112107/http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jul/15/local/me-burbank15 | archive-date = October 24, 2012 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-jan-10-me-drugtest10-story.html | title = Council Revisits Drug Testing | work =[[Los Angeles Times]] | first = Michelle | last = Keller | date = January 10, 2006 | access-date = June 26, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121024115559/http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jan/10/local/me-drugtest10 | archive-date = October 24, 2012 | url-status = live }}</ref> Pavelka was the first Burbank police officer to be fatally shot in the line of duty in the department's history, according to the California Police Association officials.

The city's namesake street, [[Burbank Boulevard]], started getting a makeover in 2007. The city spent upwards of $10 million to plant palm trees and colorful flowers, a median, new lights, benches and bike racks. Additionally, various utility boxes throughout the city were painted in 2020 with original art inspired by the theme of "A World of Entertainment." Artists were selected through a committee consisting of City of Burbank representatives and members of art communities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Calling all Artists for Burbank Arts Beautification Program |url=https://www.burbankca.gov/newsroom/-/newsdetail/20124/calling-all-artists-for-burbank-arts-beautification-program |website=City of Burbank |access-date=January 16, 2023}}</ref>

Today, an estimated 100,000 people work in Burbank. The physical imprints of the city's aviation industry remain. In late 2001, the Burbank Empire Center opened with aviation as the theme. The center, built at a cost of $250 million by Zelman Development Company, sits on Empire Avenue, the former site of Lockheed's top-secret "Skunk Works", and other Lockheed properties.

==Geography==
[[File:Snow-capped mountains Burbank, CA.jpg|thumb|Snow-capped mountains above Burbank]]

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Burbank has a total area of {{convert|17.4|sqmi|km2}}. {{convert|17.4|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.04|sqmi|km2}} of it (0.12%) is water. It is bordered by [[Glendale, California|Glendale]] to the east, [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles|North Hollywood]] and [[Toluca Lake, Los Angeles|Toluca Lake]] on the west, and [[Griffith Park]] to the south. The [[Verdugo Mountains]] form the northern border.

Elevations in the city range from {{convert|500|ft|m}} in the lower valley areas to about {{convert|800|ft|m}} near the Verdugo Mountains. Most of Burbank features a water table more than {{convert|100|ft|m}} deep, more than the measures found in the 1940s when the water table was within {{convert|50|ft|m}} of the ground surface in some areas of Burbank.

===Geology===
The geology of the Burbank area is primarily composed of sedimentary rocks, including sandstone, siltstone, and shale. These rocks were formed by sediment deposited by ancient rivers and seas, and have been uplifted and folded due to tectonic activity. Burbank is located within a seismically active area. At least eight major faults are mapped within {{convert|13.5|mi}} of Burbank's civic center. The San Fernando Fault, located {{convert|6|mi|0}} northwest of Burbank's downtown, caused the 6.6 magnitude [[1971 San Fernando earthquake]].

The Verdugo Fault, which can reach a maximum estimated 6.5 magnitude earthquake on the [[Richter Scale]], is about {{convert|1.5|mi}} from the city of Burbank's civic center. This fault extends throughout the city and is located in the alluvium just south of the Verdugo Mountains. The fault is mapped on the surface in northeastern Glendale, and at various locations in Burbank. Other nearby faults include the Northridge Hills Fault ({{convert|10|mi|0}} northwest of Burbank), the [[Newport–Inglewood Fault]] ({{convert|12.5|mi}}), Whittier Fault ({{convert|21|mi}}), and lastly the [[San Andreas Fault]] ({{convert|28|mi}}) with its 8.25 magnitude potential on the Richter Scale.<ref>{{cite book | chapter-url = http://www.burbankca.org/planning/pdf/genplan/draft2006/eir/section5-5.pdf | chapter = Geology and Soils | title = Land Use and Mobility Elements Update: City of Burbank Draft Program EIR | date = April 2006 | access-date = August 19, 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=June 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The [[1971 San Fernando earthquake]], with a magnitude of 6.6, caused some damage in Burbank. Poorly reinforced and unreinforced masonry fences were damaged as well as masonry chimneys. Pacific Manor care facility on Glenoaks, which was later razed and replaced with a new care facility, was badly damaged and had to be evacuated. Some factories, including Lockheed, had spills of hazardous materials. There were also small fires from electrical or fuel gas-related sources. Lastly, there were cases of flooding in buildings due to broken pipes and risers used for fire sprinklers.<ref name=mybur_Feb10>{{cite news|title=A Look Back At The Big Quake That Shook Burbank 40 Years Ago|url=https://myburbank.com/a-look-back-at-the-big-quake-that-shook-burbank-40-years-ago/|first=Craig|last=Sherwood|date=February 10, 2011|newspaper=MyBurbank.com}}</ref>

Burbank suffered $66.1 million in damage from the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]], according to the city's finance department. There was $58 million in damage to privately owned facilities in commercial, industrial, manufacturing and entertainment businesses. Another $8.1 million in losses included damaged public buildings, roadways and a power station in Sylmar that is partly owned by Burbank. The Burbank Fire Department responded to 292 calls for damage inspections and reports of natural gas leaks. The damage caused was more extensive than the 1971 San Fernando earthquake but still relatively moderate in nature.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.burbankfire.us/home/showpublisheddocument/88/634977218427430000#:~:text=There%20was%20one%20significant%20fire,in%20damages%20to%20private%20facilities|title=Regional All-Hazard Burbank CH-6_Earthquake |date=March 14, 2011 | first=Kenneth | last=Goettel | access-date=January 21, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://burbank.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=6&clip_id=2519&meta_id=108398|title=City of Burbank All-Hazard Mitigation Plan |date=April 2011 | first=Kenneth | last=Goettel | access-date=January 21, 2023}}</ref>

Magnolia Park, established on Burbank's western edge in the early 1920s, had 3,500 houses within six years after its creation. When the city refused to pay for a street connecting the subdivision with the Cahuenga Pass, real estate developer and daily farmer Earl L. White did it himself and called it Hollywood Way. White was the owner of KELW, the San Fernando Valley's first commercial radio station, which went on the air on February 13, 1927. KELW, a 1,000-watt station, could be heard by listeners up and down the Pacific Coast. Some reports suggest it also could be heard as far away as New Zealand.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.radioheritage.net/story36.asp | title = Early Tejano Music heard in New Zealand

Independent merchants and slow-growth groups have fought off new construction and [[big-box store]]s. The neighborhood remains quiet despite being beneath the airport flight path and bordered by arterial streets.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

One of the centerpieces of the area's comeback has been [[Rosa Porto|Porto's Bakery]] at the old Albin's drug store site located at 3606 and 3614 West Magnolia Boulevard. As part of the project, Burbank loaned Porto's funds for building upgrades. Under the agreement, a portion of the loan will be forgiven over a 10-year period. East of Porto's is Antique Row, a hub for shopping in the city.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.dailynews.com | title=Porto's gets city loan for expansion | first=Alex | last=Dobuzinskis | work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] | date=November 25, 2004 | access-date=January 15, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116004407/https://www.dailynews.com/ | archive-date=January 16, 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>

Other enhancements include converting the disused railroad right-of-way along Chandler Boulevard into a landscaped bikeway and pedestrian path. This project was part of [[G Line Bikeway|a larger bike route]] linking Burbank's [[Downtown Burbank station|downtown Metrolink station]] with the [[B Line (Los Angeles Metro)|B Line]] subway in North Hollywood.

====Rancho Equestrian area====
Perhaps the most famous collection of neighborhoods in Burbank is the Rancho Equestrian District, flanked roughly by Griffith Park to the south, Victory Boulevard to the east, Olive Avenue to the west and Alameda Avenue to the north. Part of the Rancho community extends into neighboring Glendale.

The neighborhood zoning allows residents to keep horses on their property. Single-family homes far outnumber multifamily units in the Rancho, and many of the homes have stables and horse stalls. There are about 785 single-family homes, 180 condos and townhomes, and 250 horses.

The Rancho has traditionally been represented by the Burbank Rancho Homeowners, which was formed in 1963 by Floran Frank and other equestrian enthusiasts and is the oldest neighborhood group in the city.

Rancho real estate sells at a premium due to its equestrian zoning, numerous parks, connection to riding trails in Griffith Park and its adjacency to Warner Bros. and Disney Studios. Riverside Drive, its main thoroughfare, is lined with [[sycamore]] and [[oak]] trees, some more than 70 years old. It is quite common to see people on [[horseback riding]] along Riverside Drive's designated horse lanes. Of historical note, the Rancho was the home to TV star Mister Ed, the talking horse of [[Mister Ed|the show of the same name]]. Other notable former Rancho residents included [[Ava Gardner]] and [[Tab Hunter]], as well as [[Bette Davis]] in the adjoining Glendale Rancho area.

The rancho is especially known for its parks and open space. This includes centrally located Mountain View Park, Johnny Carson Park, Los Angeles' Griffith Park and Equestrian Center, Bette Davis Park (in the adjoining Glendale Rancho) and the neighborhood's beloved Polliwog, extending along Disney's animation building and used by local residents to exercise their horses.

In the 1960s, [[General Motors Corporation]] opened training facilities on Riverside Drive in the Rancho area, but in 1999 decided to contract out dealer-technician training to [[Raytheon Company]] and dismissed a dozen employees. In 2006, GM confiscated [[EV1]] electric-powered cars from drivers who had leased them and moved them to the GM facility in Burbank. When environmentalists determined the location of the cars, they began a month-long vigil at the facility.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.motortrend.com/auto_news/112_news050218_ev1vigil/index.html | title = EV1 Vigil At GM Burbank Facility Enters Day Three | date = February 18, 2005 | work = [[Motor Trend]] | access-date = January 4, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090108031931/http://www.motortrend.com/auto_news/112_news050218_ev1vigil/index.html | archive-date = January 8, 2009 | url-status = live }}</ref> To challenge the company's line that they were unwanted, they found buyers for all of them, offering a total of $1.9 million.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://evworld.com/news.cfm?newsid=7766 | title = EV1 Vigilers Pledge to Pay GM $1.9 Million for 'Incarcerated' Electric Cars | first = Bill | last = Moore | date = February 27, 2005 | work = EV World | access-date = January 4, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110710211358/http://evworld.com/news.cfm?newsid=7766 | archive-date = July 10, 2011 | url-status = dead }}</ref> The vehicles were loaded on trucks and removed, and several activists who tried to intervene were arrested.

'''Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank''' is a major [[filmmaking]] facility owned and run by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.]] in Burbank, [[California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://studiofacilities.warnerbros.com/|title=Warner Bros.

The First National studio, as it was then known, became the official home of Warner Bros.–First National Pictures with four [[sound stages]].<ref name=guide>{{cite book|title=Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood Official Guide|page=22|year=2015|publisher=Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.}}</ref> By 1937, Warner Bros. had all but closed the Sunset studio, making the Burbank lot its main headquarters—which it remains to this day. Eventually, Warner dissolved the First National company and the site has often been referred to as simply '''Warner Bros. Studios''' since. The studio runs public backlot tours that offer visitors the chance to glimpse behind the scenes of one of the oldest film studios in the world ([[Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood]]).

In 1999, [[Cartoon Network Studios]], a division of [[Warner Bros.]] took up residence in an old commercial bakery building located on North 3rd Street when it separated its production operations from [[Warner Bros. Animation]] in [[Sherman Oaks]]. On April 15, 2019, it was announced that [[Warner Bros.]] will sell [[Warner Bros. Ranch]], another one of its facilities to Worthe Real Estate Group and Stockbridge Real Estate Fund as part of a larger real estate deal to be completed in 2023 which will see the studio get ownership of [[The Burbank Studios]] in time to mark its 100th anniversary.<ref>{{Cite web|date=April 15, 2019|title=Warner Bros. plans to buy Burbank Studios and occupy new Frank Gehry 'iceberg' towers|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-warner-bros-burbank-studios-gehry-design-ranch-sale-20190415-story.html|access-date=April 20, 2021|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref>

====Walt Disney Studios====
{{Main|Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)}}

[[File:Walt_Disney_Studios_Alameda_Entrance.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]], the headquarters of [[The Walt Disney Company]]]]

The Walt Disney Studios in Burbank serve as the international headquarters for media conglomerate [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Disney staff began the move from the old Disney studio at Hyperion Avenue in [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake]] on December 24, 1939. Designed primarily by [[Kem Weber]] under the supervision of [[Walt Disney]] and his brother [[Roy O. Disney|Roy]], the Burbank Disney Studio buildings are the only studios to survive from the Golden Age of film. Disney is the only remaining [[Major film studio|major studio]] company to remain independent from a larger conglomerate and whose parent entity is still located in the Los Angeles area. Disney is also the only major film studio that does not run public backlot tours.

====Providencia Ranch====
Filmmaking began in the [[Providencia Ranch]] area (marked in yellow on the Providencia Land, Water & Development Co. map in [[#Early history|this section]]). Nestor Studios began using the ranch location in 1911. The Providencia Ranch became part of the Universal Film Manufacturing operations on the Pacific/West Coast in 1912. From 1912 to 1914 Universal's ranch studio was also referred to as the Oak Crest Ranch. Carl Laemmle called the ranch "Universal City" as recorded in issues of ''[[The Moving Picture World]]'' Volume: 16 (April – June 1913). Universal City existed on the Providencia Land and Water property from 1912 to 1914. In 1914, the Oak Crest studio ranch and Hollywood studio operation would move to the new Universal City located on the Lankershim Land and Water property. The official public opening occurred on March 15, 1915, on the Lankershim Property. The new Universal City (three tracts of land) was much larger than the old Universal (Oak/Providencia) Ranch. The Universal Ranch tract of land became smaller after the 1914 move to the Taylor Ranch. The leased land surrounding the Universal ranch would soon become the Lasky Ranch. The Providencia property was used as a filming location by other motion picture companies, most notably for battle scenes in the silent classic about the American Civil War, ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915).

====Olive Memorial Park====
From 1949 to 1952, the [[St. Louis Browns]], a [[Major League Baseball]] team, selected Burbank as their destination for spring training to escape the harsh winters of the Midwest. As the players donned their uniforms and stepped onto the field at Olive Memorial Park, they not only honed their baseball skills but also forged a special bond with Burbank and its Hollywood luminaries. Workers in Burbank came by during their lunch hour to watch the game.<ref>{{Cite web|date=February 25, 2015|title=SPRING TRAINING SPECIAL: Re-Live the History of the St. Louis Browns in Burbank|url=https://myburbank.com/spring-training-in-burbank-re-live-the-history-of-the-st-louis-browns/|access-date=December 10, 2023|website=myburbank.com|language=en-US}}</ref> Additionally, well-known entertainment figures such as [[Bing Crosby]], [[Bob Hope]], and [[Nat King Cole]] would gather to witness the action. [[Marilyn Monroe]] herself even joined the Browns for promotional photos. Over time, the St. Louis Browns would evolve into the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. The [[Los Angeles Rams]] also used the stadium from 1958 to 1962 as a practice field.<ref>{{Cite web|date=April 17, 1986|title=The St. Louis Browns Came West 34 Years Ago for Spring Training and Took Up Residence in a Park That Was Only a Long Home Run From Downtown Burbank: The Stadium That Time Forgot|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-04-17-sp-45-story.html |access-date=December 10, 2023|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref> While the stadium, originally dedicated in 1947 to commemorate the soldiers lost in [[World War II]], saw its stands razed in 1995, the fields themselves endure as an integral part of the Olive Recreation Center. In 1984, the park underwent a name change and became known as George Izay Park.<ref>{{Cite web|date=October 2, 1994|title=Burbank's Big Leagues: At Olive Memorial Stadium, Hapless St. Louis Browns Got Some Respect|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-10-02-me-45584-story.html|access-date=December 10, 2023|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref>

Criminal offenses are charged and locally prosecuted in the Burbank Courthouse. The Los Angeles District Attorney handles all of the felony violations which occur within Burbank city limits. The Burbank City Attorney, through its Prosecution Division, handles the remaining violations, which include all misdemeanors and municipal code violations, as well as traffic offenses. The Burbank Superior Court is a high-volume courthouse, which is part of the [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]] system. The City Prosecutor files approximately 5,500 cases yearly, and the Burbank Police Department directly files approximately 12,000 to 15,000 traffic citations per year. Burbank Court, Division Two, handles all of the misdemeanor arraignments for Burbank offenses. A typical arraignment calendar is between 100 and 120 cases each day, including 15 to 25 defendants who are brought to court in custody. Many cases are initiated by arrests at the Hollywood Burbank Airport. Common arrests include possession of drugs such as marijuana, weapons, prohibited items, as well as false identification charges.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Nearby [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] is a symbol of the entertainment industry and much of the production occurs in Burbank. Many companies have headquarters or facilities in Burbank, including [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros.

Burbank's economy felt stress as a result of the recession. From 2007 to 2016, the city had more than 1,200 home foreclosures, with about three-fourths of them happening from 2007 to 2011.<ref name="auto"/> City officials prepared for cutbacks going into 2009. Burbank's City Manager, Mike Flad, estimated the city's 2009–10 fiscal budget would suffer a 5% shortfall. In fact, the city's budget woes continued well into 2017. At the beginning of the budget development process for fiscal 2016–17, the city's staff was projecting a recurring budget deficit of $1.3 million for the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burbankca.gov/home/showdocument?id=36772|publisher=Burbank, CA|title=City Manager's Budget Message|access-date=January 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301085644/http://burbankca.gov/home/showdocument?id=36772|archive-date=March 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> That followed several years of across-the-board budget cuts by various city departments, according to budget documents. Even so, the city still managed to add some new positions and increase fire staffing. One of the increased costs Burbank and many other California cities are coping with is unfunded pension liability.

The city manager's budget message in 2016-17 identified Burbank's aging infrastructure as one of the top priorities of city officials but also one of its biggest financial challenges. The city's 2017 budget documents indicated Burbank should be spending at least $5 million more annually to address the backlog of maintenance on infrastructure and update Burbank's facilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burbankca.gov/home/showdocument?id=36765|publisher=Burbank, CA|access-date=January 7, 2017|title=Adopted Annual Budget 2016-2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301083930/http://burbankca.gov/home/showdocument?id=36765|archive-date=March 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Regardless, the city forecasts it will post a deficit for at least the next five years, projecting about $9.4 million in red ink in fiscal year 2017-18 and a deficit of about $27.4 million by 2022–23.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.latimes.com/socal/burbank-leader/news/tn-blr-me-looking-ahead-20180102-story.html | title = Looking ahead at stories affecting the Media City: Systemic city budget shortfall still looming | first = Burbank Leader | last = staff | date = January 2, 2018 | work = [[Burbank Leader]] | access-date = January 8, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180108054132/http://www.latimes.com/socal/burbank-leader/news/tn-blr-me-looking-ahead-20180102-story.html | archive-date = January 8, 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref>

===Shopping===
The revitalized downtown Burbank provides an urban mix of shopping, dining, and entertainment. The San Fernando Strip is an exclusive mall designed to be a modern urban village, with apartments above the mall. An upscale shopping district is located in the state-of-the-art Empire Center neighborhood. The [[Burbank Town Center]] is a retail complex adjacent to the downtown core that was built in two phases between 1991 and 1992.

In 1979, the Burbank Redevelopment Agency entered into an agreement with San Diego–based Ernest Hahn Company to build a regional mall known as Media City Center. It would later get renamed [[Burbank Town Center]] and undergo a $130 million facelift starting in 2004, including a new exterior streetscape façade. The agency, helped out with its powers of eminent domain, spent $52 million to buy up the {{convert|41|acre|m2|adj=on}} land in the area bounded by the [[Golden State Freeway]], [[Burbank Boulevard]], Third Street and [[Magnolia Boulevard]].

Original plans were for Media City Center included four anchor tenants, including a J.W. Robinson's. But May Co. Department Stores later bought the parent company of Robinson's and dropped out of the deal. The other stores then dropped out as well and Hahn and the agency dropped the project in March 1987. Within months, Burbank entered into negotiations with the [[Walt Disney Company]] for a shopping mall and office complex to be called the "Disney MGM Backlot."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/todd_james_pierce/archive/2008/05/28/looking-back-on-the-disney-mgm-studio-backlot-project-part-i.aspx | title = Looking back on the Disney-MGM Studio Backlot project – Part I | first = Todd James | last = Pierce | work = Jim Hill Media | date = May 28, 2008 | access-date = January 4, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090201163106/http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/todd_james_pierce/archive/2008/05/28/looking-back-on-the-disney-mgm-studio-backlot-project-part-i.aspx | archive-date = February 1, 2009 | url-status = live }}</ref> Disney had estimated that it could spend $150 million to $300 million on a complex of shops, restaurants, theaters, clubs and hotel, and had offered to move its animation department and [[Disney Channel]] cable network operation to the property as well. These plans ended in failure in February 1988 when Disney executives determined that the costs were too high.

In January 1989, Burbank began Media City Center project negotiations with two developers, the Alexander Haagen Co. of Manhattan Beach and Price Kornwasser Associates of San Diego. Eight months later, Haagen won the contract and commenced construction, leading to the $250 million mall's opening in August 1991. Under terms of the agreement with Haagen, the city funded an $18 million parking garage and made between $8 and $12 million in improvements to the surrounding area. Plans by [[Sheraton Corporation]] to build a 300-room hotel at the mall were shelved because of the weak economy.

The new mall helped take the strain off Burbank's troubled economy, which had been hard hit by the departure of several large industrial employers, including Lockheed Corp. The center was partially financed with $50 million in city redevelopment funds. Construction had been in doubt for many years by economic woes and political turmoil since it was first proposed in the late 1970s. In 2003, Irvine-based Crown Realty & Development purchased the {{convert|1200000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Burbank Town Center from [[Pan Pacific Retail Properties]] for $111 million. Crown then hired [[General Growth Properties Inc.]], a Chicago-based real estate investment trust, for property management and leasing duties. At the time, the Burbank mall ranked as the No. 6 retail center in [[Los Angeles County]] in terms of leasable square footage, with estimated combined tenant volumes in excess of $240 million.

In 1994, Lockheed selected Chicago-based [[Homart Development Company]] as the developer of a retail center on a former [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]] production facility near the Burbank Airport that was subject to a major toxic clean-up project. A year later, Lockheed merged with [[Martin Marietta]] to become [[Lockheed Martin Corp.]] Lockheed was ordered to clean up the toxics as part of a federal [[Superfund]] site.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-mar-08-me-lockheed8-story.html | title = EPA Slashes Fine for Burbank Lockheed Plant | first = Caitlin | last = Liu | date = March 8, 2003 | work =[[Los Angeles Times]] | access-date = January 4, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121024115647/http://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/08/local/me-lockheed8 | archive-date = October 24, 2012 | url-status = live }}</ref> The northern Burbank area also became identified as the San Fernando Valley's hottest toxic spot in 1989 by the [[South Coast Air Quality Management District]], with Lockheed identified among major contributors.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://chipjacobs.com/articles/environmental/lockheed-resolves-toxic-claims/ | title = Lockheed Resolves Toxic Claims | first1 = Beth | last1 = Barrett | first2 = Lee | last2 = Condon | first3 = Chip | last3 = Jacobs | date = August 4, 1996 | work = [[Los Angeles Daily News|Daily News]] | access-date = January 4, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110813133520/http://chipjacobs.com/articles/environmental/lockheed-resolves-toxic-claims/ | archive-date = August 13, 2011 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Lockheed always maintained the site was never a health risk to the community.

[[File:planet p38a.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]] production line in Burbank. The site is now the location of Burbank Empire Center.]]
The Lockheed toxic clean-up site, just east of the Golden State Freeway, later became home to the [[Empire Center (Burbank)|Empire Center]]. Four developers competed to be selected to build the $300 million outdoor mall on the site. In 1999, Lockheed picked Los Angeles-based [[Zelman Cos.]] from among other contenders to create the retail-office complex on a {{convert|103|acre|km2|adj=on}} site.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-jan-18-me-55033-story.html | title = Huge 'Power Center Mall' Awaits Burbank's Blessing | first = D.B. | last = Young | date = January 18, 2000 | work =[[Los Angeles Times]] | access-date = January 4, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121024115815/http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jan/18/local/me-55033 | archive-date = October 24, 2012 | url-status = live }}</ref> Zelman purchased the land in 2000 for around $70 million. As part of the sales agreement, Lockheed carried out extensive soil vapor removal on the site. Lockheed had manufactured planes on the site from 1928 to 1991. Together with $42 million for demolition and $12 million for site investigation, Lockheed would eventually spend $115 million on the project.

[[Warner Bros.]] proposed building a sports arena there for the Kings and the Clippers on the former B-1 bomber plant site. Price Club wanted it for a new store. Disney considered moving some operations there too.

In late 2012, IKEA announced plans to relocate to a new site in Burbank. Its original location was situated north of the Burbank Town Center mall. The new location was approved by the city in 2014 and is just north of Alameda Avenue and east of the Golden State Freeway. The new 456,000-square-foot store was completed in February 2017, and when it opened was the largest IKEA in the United States.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-burbank-ikea-20140312-story.html | title = urban approves construction of largest Ikea store in U.S. | first1 = Alene | last1 = Tchekmedyian | date = March 12, 2014 | work = [[Burbank Leader]] | access-date = September 9, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151016164217/http://articles.latimes.com/2014/mar/12/local/la-me-ln-burbank-ikea-20140312 | archive-date = October 16, 2015 | url-status = live }}</ref>

==Government==
[[File:BurbankPostOffice.jpg|thumb|[[Downtown Burbank Post Office]], built in a [[Mission Revival]] style 1937–38.]]

Burbank is a [[charter city]] which operates under a [[Council–manager government|council–manager]] form of government.<ref name=cc /> In 1927, voters approved the council–manager form of government. The five-member City Council is elected for four-year overlapping terms, with the Mayor appointed annually from among the council. The City Clerk and the City Treasurer are also elected officials.

Burbank is a full-service, independent city, with offices of the City Manager and City Attorney, and departments of Community Development, Financial Services, Fire, Information Technology, Library Services, Management Services, Police, Parks-Recreation & Community Services, Public Works, and Burbank Water and Power (BWP).

Burbank opened its first library in 1913 as a contracted branch of the Los Angeles County Library. In 1938, the Burbank Public Library began operation separately from the county as a city department. Today, there are three public library locations in Burbank. The newest location is the Buena Vista Branch Library, which opened in 2022. In March 2020, the [[COVID-19]] pandemic caused normal life to come to a standstill. The staff at Burbank Public Library adapted and transitioned services to meet the new circumstances. They implemented curbside pickup and virtual programming to connect the community and provide access to resources. They also provided homework help for students and ensured that all students had access to online resources.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://burbanklibrary.org/about/about-library/our-history-through-decades |title=Our History Through the Decades |publisher=Burbank Public Library Department |access-date=January 22, 2023 }}</ref>

In October 2023, Burbank received a grant of $9.95 million from the California State Library. This funding is set to breathe life into the vision of a new Central Library. This planned state-of-the-art library is an integral component of the ambitious Burbank Civic Center Project, a project including the development of affordable and workforce housing, new open space, parking, and city office space in downtown Burbank. The upcoming library will serve as a replacement for the existing facility, a 60-year-old building that faces limitations due to its age and condition. This new library is designed to better cater to the educational, workforce development, technology training, and information and culture access needs of the Burbank community.<ref>{{cite web |title=City of Burbank Awarded $9.95 Million Grant to Build a Modern Central Library |publisher=City of Burbank |date=October 16, 2023 |url=http://www.scppa.org/Downloads/Press%20Releases/may16mppnewsrelease.pdf |access-date=December 9, 2023 |archive-date=July 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728005803/http://www.scppa.org/Downloads/Press%20Releases/may16mppnewsrelease.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The first power was distributed within the city limits of Burbank in 1913, supplied then by [[Southern California Edison Company]]. Today, the city-owned BWP serves 45,000 households and 6,000 businesses in Burbank with water and electricity. Additionally, the $382-million annual revenue utility offers fiber optic services. Burbank's city garbage pickup service began in 1920; outhouses were banned in 1922.

Most of Burbank's current power comes from the Magnolia Power Project, a 310-megawatt natural gas-fired combined cycle generating plant located on [[Magnolia Boulevard]] near the [[Interstate 5]] freeway. The municipal power plant, jointly owned by six Southern California cities (Burbank, Glendale, Anaheim. Pasadena, Colton, and Cerritos), began generating electricity in 2005. It replaced a 1941 facility that had served the customers of Burbank for almost 60 years.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.scppa.org/Downloads/Press%20Releases/may16mppnewsrelease.pdf |title=6 Southern California Cities to Celebrate Dedication of Magnolia Power Project in Burbank on June 2 |publisher=Magnolia power project |date=May 16, 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728005803/http://www.scppa.org/Downloads/Press%20Releases/may16mppnewsrelease.pdf |archive-date=July 28, 2011 }}</ref>

At the height of [[California electricity crisis|California's 2001 energy crisis]], BWP unveiled a mini-power plant at its landfill. It marked the world's first commercial landfill power plant using Capstone microturbine technology. Ten microturbines run on [[landfill gas]], producing 300 kilowatts of renewable energy for Burbank. That is enough energy to serve the daily needs of about 250 homes. The landfill is located in the Verdugo Mountains in the northeastern portion of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.burbankwaterandpower.com/news/landfill-gas-microturbine-generators |title=City of Burbank Expands Landfill Gas Installation |work=Burbank Water & Power |access-date=January 7, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222043430/http://burbankwaterandpower.com/news/landfill-gas-microturbine-generators |archive-date=December 22, 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> In 2015, Burbank reached its 2007 goal of providing 33% renewable energy to the city five years ahead of schedule. As of 2017, the city was getting 35% of its power from renewables.

Like other cities in [[California]], Burbank has a long history of facing drought conditions and water cutbacks mandated by the state. In September 2021, as the drought worsened, Burbank proactively moved to Stage II in an effort to comply with the governor's challenge to reduce water use by 15% from 2020 levels. Despite these efforts, the drought continued to worsen, and by June 2022, Burbank was forced to adopt Stage III of their Sustainable Water Use Ordinance. With heavy rains in January 2023, the drought conditions eased, even though Burbank remains 100% dependent on imported water purchased from the [[Metropolitan Water District of Southern California]].<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.burbankca.gov/newsroom/-/newsdetail/20124/press-release-burbank-remains-on-stage-iii-of-the-sustainable-water-use-ordinance |title=Burbank Remains on Stage III of the Sustainable Water Use Ordinance |work=City of Burbank|date=January 12, 2023 }}</ref> The Sustainable Water Use Ordinance sets specific targets for water conservation and requires businesses and residents to comply with certain water-saving measures.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.burbankwaterandpower.com/component/bwpforms/?task=waterwaste |format=PDF |title=Burbank Power & Water |publisher=Burbank Power & Water |date=May 4, 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728005803/http://www.scppa.org/Downloads/Press%20Releases/may16mppnewsrelease.pdf |archive-date=July 28, 2011}}</ref>

According to Burbank Water and Power, over the last 10 to 15 years, Burbank residents have successfully decreased their water consumption by 22%, from 170 gallons per person to 132 gallons per person.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://spectrumnews1.com/ca/la-west/environment/2021/10/27/burbank-restrictions-on-landscape-water-use |title=Burbank places restrictions on landscape water use as drought worsens |last=Aziza |first=Shuler |publisher=Spectrum News One |date=October 27, 2021 |access-date=January 16, 2023 }}</ref> Previously, the 2015 drought in Burbank lasted for several years and led to a reduced water supply for the city and its residents, causing a focus on water conservation and the long-term sustainability of the area's water resources.

The state threatened stiff fines for non-compliance.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.marinij.com/2015/06/05/california-drought-jerry-brown-says-10000-a-day-state-fines-for-water-wasting-cities-are-not-bluster/ |title=California drought: Jerry Brown says $10,000-a-day state fines for water-wasting cities are not bluster |last=Rogers |first=Paul |newspaper=Marin Independent Journal |date=June 15, 2015 |access-date=January 16, 2023 }}</ref>

The Burbank City Council lost a court case in 2000 involving the right to begin meetings with a sectarian prayer.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=16933 |title=City Council can't begin meetings with sectarian prayer |work=[[Freedom Forum]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=September 10, 2002 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081129065609/http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=16933 |archive-date=November 29, 2008 }}</ref> A [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]] judge ruled that prayers referencing specific religions violated the principle of separation of church and state in the First Amendment. While invocations were still allowed, Burbank officials were required to advise all clerics that sectarian prayer as part of Council meetings was not permitted under the Constitution.

In 1977, Californians passed [[Proposition 13]], a property tax initiative, and Burbank and other cities in the state soon experienced constrained revenues. Burbank dealt with the ramifications of maintaining service levels expected by the community but still with impacts on city finances. As a result, Burbank officials opted to cut some services and implement user fees for specialized services and residents in special zoned areas. One fee was an equine license fee for owners of horse property, even if they no longer owned a horse just to keep from losing their rural zoning.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-01-01-we-1696-story.html |title=Bounty Hunt : Los Angeles Targets Horse Owners Who Haven't Paid Fee |author=Martha L.

===City Hall===
[[File:Burbank City Hall (DSCF0794-DSCF0798).jpg|thumb|right|Burbank City Hall]]

In 1916, the original Burbank City Hall was constructed after bonds were issued to finance the project and pay for fire apparatus. Burbank's current City Hall was constructed from 1941 to 1942 in a neo-federalist Moderne style popular in the late Depression era. The structure was built at a total cost of $409,000, with funding from the [[Federal Works Agency]] and [[Works Project Administration]] programs. City Hall was designed by architects [[William H. Allen (architect)|William Allen]] and W. George Lutzi and completed in 1943.

Originally, the City Hall building housed all city services, including the police and fire departments, an emergency medical ward, a courthouse and a jail. One of the most distinctive features of the cream-colored concrete building is its {{convert|77|ft|m|adj=on}} tower, which serves as the main lobby. The lobby interior features more than 20 types of marble, which can be found in the city seal on the floor, the trim, walls and in the treads and risers of the grand stairway. Artist Hugo Ballin created a "Four Freedoms" mural in Burbank's City Council chambers during World War II, although it was covered up for decades until art aficionados convinced the city to have the mural fully revealed. Ballin's work illustrates the "Four Freedoms" outlined in President [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s 1941 speech at the signing of the [[Atlantic Charter]].

In 1996, the City Hall was added to the [[U.S. National Register of Historic Places]], becoming the second building in Burbank to be listed on the register. The first was Burbank's main post office just blocks away from City Hall on Olive Avenue. In 1998, Burbank's state-of-the-art Police/Fire facility opened.

==Education==
[[File:Providencia School.jpg|thumb|Providencia School]]
Burbank is within the [[Burbank Unified School District]]. The district was formed on June 3, 1879, following a petition filed by residents S.W. White and nine other citizens.{{r|Ref-1}} First named the Providencia School District, Burbank's district started with one schoolhouse built for $400 on a site donated by Dr. Burbank, the area's single largest landholder. The first schoolhouse, a single redwood-sided building serving nine families, is on what is now [[Burbank Boulevard]] near Mariposa Street. In 1887, a new schoolhouse was constructed at [[San Fernando Boulevard]] and [[Magnolia Boulevard]], which was in Burbank's center of commerce.

In 1908, citizens passed a bond measure to raise money to build a high school. At the time, Burbank-area high school students were attending schools in Glendale. When it opened on September 14, 1908, the original [[Burbank High School (Burbank, California)|Burbank High School]] had 42 students and two instructors.{{r|Ref-1}}

The largest university in Burbank is [[Woodbury University]]. Woodbury has a number of undergraduate and graduate programs, including business, architecture, and several design programs. A number of smaller colleges are also located in Burbank, including several makeup and beauty trade schools serving the entertainment industry.

During the early 1920s, Burbank was a contender to become the location for the southern branch of the [[University of California]]. Planners were considering locating the university in the Ben Mar Hills area near Amherst Drive and San Fernando Boulevard. The seaside community of [[Rancho Palos Verdes]] was also considered for the campus.

The [[Hollywood Burbank Airport]], until late 2017 known as Bob Hope Airport, serves over 4 million travelers per year with six major carriers and over 70 flights daily. The airport, located in the northwestern corner of the city, is the source of most street traffic in the city. Noise from the airport has been a source of concern for nearly decades. There was even a report in 2018 that a new satellite air-traffic control system may be responsible for some of the noise by putting jets on a path that includes certain neighborhoods.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.latimes.com/socal/burbank-leader/news/tn-blr-me-faa-letter-20170113-story.html | title = Burbank seeks to write joint letter with airport authority regarding NextGen | first = Anthony | last = Clark Carpio | date = January 12, 2018 | work =[[Los Angeles Times]] | access-date = January 15, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180116020441/http://www.latimes.com/socal/burbank-leader/news/tn-blr-me-faa-letter-20170113-story.html | archive-date = January 16, 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref> A bill introduced in May 2013 by two California congressmen would put into law an overnight curfew on flights from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. The U.S. [[Federal Aviation Administration]] had rejected the airports' applications for a curfew.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20130522/congressmen-try-again-for-nighttime-curfews-at-van-nuys-burbank-airports|title=Congressmen try again for nighttime curfews at Van Nuys, Burbank airports|website=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|date=May 22, 2013|access-date=February 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223033427/http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20130522/congressmen-try-again-for-nighttime-curfews-at-van-nuys-burbank-airports|archive-date=February 23, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> However, the airport still suggests a volunteer curfew of 10 p.m. to 7 a.m., where airlines are strongly encouraged not to schedule any arrivals or departures, to respect the surrounding neighborhoods.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hollywoodburbankairport.com/noise-issues/noise-rules-summary/|title=Noise Rules Summary|date=October 20, 2015|website=Hollywood Burbank Airport|access-date=February 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228012648/http://hollywoodburbankairport.com/noise-issues/noise-rules-summary/|archive-date=February 28, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In December 2008, a slowdown in passenger traffic led the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority to curtail spending plans, including deferring multimillion-dollar construction projects. The weak economy continued to affect the airport in 2010, with figures showing a 6% decline in passengers for the fiscal year ending June 30. The slowdown is one reason the airport authority scrapped plans to spend $4 million to erect barriers at the west end of the runway.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kisliuk |first=Bill |url=http://www.burbankleader.com/news/tn-blr-airport-20101020,0,7742375.story |title=Bright news for Bob Hope Airport |publisher=Burbank Leader |date=October 20, 2010 |access-date=December 19, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124211208/http://www.burbankleader.com/news/tn-blr-airport-20101020,0,7742375.story |archive-date=November 24, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2000, a [[Southwest Airlines]] [[Boeing 737]] flight with 142 persons aboard overshot the runway and went through the east fence, coming to a stop on Hollywood Way near a Chevron gas station.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2002/AAB0204.pdf |title=Southwest Airlines flight 1455, Burbank, California, March 5, 2000 |access-date=December 19, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228112244/https://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2002/AAB0204.pdf |archive-date=December 28, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Roads and highways====
[[File:SR 134 Ventura Freeway looking west from N Pass Ave.jpg|thumb|right|SR 134 Ventura Freeway at Pass Avenue in Burbank]]
The construction of major freeways through and around the city of Burbank starting in the 1950s both divided the city from itself and linked it to the rapidly growing Los Angeles region. Burbank is easily accessible by and can easily access the [[Southern California freeways]] via the [[Golden State Freeway]] ([[Interstate 5 in California|I-5]]), which bisects the city from northwest to southeast, and the [[Ventura Freeway]] which connects Burbank to [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]] on the south and the nearby [[Interstate 210 (California)|Foothill Freeway]] to the east. The Ventura Freeway was completed in 1960.

In May 2012, the state Transportation Commission approved $224.1 million in funding for the improvements to the [[Golden State Freeway]] ([[Interstate 5 in California|I-5]]) in the Burbank area along with safety improvements to the railroad tracks at Buena Vista Street.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kellam |first=Mark |url=http://www.glendalenewspress.com/news/tn-gnp-0529-interstate-5-project-gets-major-piece-of-funding,0,3819683.story |title=Interstate 5 project through Burbank gets major piece of funding |publisher=Glendale News Press |date=May 29, 2012 |access-date=August 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017213332/http://www.glendalenewspress.com/news/tn-gnp-0529-interstate-5-project-gets-major-piece-of-funding,0,3819683.story |archive-date=October 17, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The allocation will fund most of the effort to build a new interchange at Empire Avenue, giving greater access to the nearby Empire Center shopping center as it prepares to get a Walmart store.

Burbank contains about {{convert|227.5|mi|km}} of streets, nearly {{convert|50|mi|km}} of paved alleys, {{convert|365.3|mi|km}} of sidewalks, 181 signalized intersections and 10 intersections with flashing signals, according to city figures. Many of the current signals date back to the late 1960s, when voters passed a major capital improvement program for street beautification and street lighting. The funding also helped upgrade dated park and library facilities.<ref>{{cite book| chapter-url = http://www.ci.burbank.ca.us/finance/2008-09%20Adopted%20budget/appendix.0809.pdf | chapter = Burbank – A community profile and historical timeline | title = Adopted budget FY 2008–09 | url = http://www.ci.burbank.ca.us/finance/2008-09%20Adopted%20budget/Adopted_budget_fy_2008.htm| publisher = City of Burbank | date = June 17, 2008}}</ref> The [[Burbank Chandler Bike Path]] is popular with cyclist and pedestrians alike.

====Transit====
[[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|Metro]] operates [[public transport]] throughout [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], including Burbank. Commuters can use [[Metrolink (California)|Metrolink]] and [[Amtrak]] for service south into [[Downtown Los Angeles|Downtown]], west to [[Ventura County|Ventura]] and north to [[Palmdale, California|Palmdale]] and beyond. Burbank has three rail stations:  [[Burbank Airport–North station]], served by the [[Antelope Valley Line]], [[Burbank Airport–South station]], served by the [[Ventura County Line]], and the Amtrak [[Pacific Surfliner]], and [[Downtown Burbank station]], served by both Metrolink lines but not Amtrak. Burbank has its own public transportation system known as the [[Burbank Bus]]. In 2006, Burbank opened its first hydrogen fueling station for automobiles.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Hydrogen Fueling Stations|url=http://www.fuelcells.org/uploads/h2fuelingstations-US4.pdf|website=Fuel Cells 2000|access-date=April 15, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415220939/http://www.fuelcells.org/uploads/h2fuelingstations-US4.pdf|archive-date=April 15, 2015}}</ref>

The projected [[California High-Speed Rail]] route will pass through the city and include [[Burbank Airport station (California High-Speed Rail)|a stop near Burbank]].

===Public safety===
====Fire department====
At the time of cityhood, Burbank had a volunteer fire department. Fire protection depended upon the bucket brigade and finding a hydrant. It wasn't until 1913 that the city created its own fire department. By 1916, the city was installing an additional 40 new fire hydrants but still relying on volunteers for fire fighting. In 1927, the city switched from a volunteer fire department to a professional one.

The department consists of six strategically located fire stations, consisting of 6 fire engines (type 1); 2 aerial ladder trucks (tractor-drawn) and 3 paramedic ambulances.

[[File:Glendale Fire Department truck in Burbank 2015-01-19.jpg|thumb|Glendale Fire Department responding to a call in Burbank]]

In the late 1970s, Burbank became part of the Verdugo Fire Communications Center under a joint agreement with Glendale and [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]].<ref>{{cite news

}}</ref> All three cities were experiencing issues with fire dispatching at the time. Like a lot of cities, dispatching was done by law enforcement due to cost-effectiveness. A "tri-city" joint dispatching center was created to solve the issue and fill the void. Under the contract, Burbank provided a Hazardous Materials team, Glendale provided an Air-Light unit as well as the dispatch center, and Pasadena provided an Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) Type Heavy team. Today, both Glendale and Pasadena offer USAR Type 1 Heavy teams. The three city fire departments are all dispatched from the Verdugo Fire Communications Center, located in Glendale. Each of the three cities shares the cost of operating and maintaining this dispatch facility. Today, Verdugo is a regional dispatch center, providing communications for all 13 fire departments in California's OES "Area C" mutual aid area and the 14th agency which is the Burbank Airport Fire Department.

===Hospitals===
In 1907, Burbank's first major hospital opened under the name "Burbank Community Hospital". The 16-bed facility served the community during a deadly [[smallpox]] epidemic in 1913 and helped it brace for possible air raids at the start of [[World War II]]. The two-story hospital was located at Olive Avenue and Fifth Street. By 1925, the hospital was expanded to 50 beds and in the mid-1980s operated with 103 beds and a staff of over 175 physicians. For years, it also was the only hospital in Burbank where women could receive abortions, tubal ligations and other procedures not offered at what is now [[Providence St. Joseph Medical Center]]. A physicians group acquired the hospital for $2 million in 1990 and renamed it Thompson Memorial Medical Center, in honor of the hospital's founder, Dr. Elmer H. Thompson. He was a general practitioner who made house calls by bicycle and horseback. In 2001, Burbank Community Hospital was razed to make way for a Belmont Village Senior Living community. Proceeds from that sale went to the Burbank Health Care Foundation, which assists community organizations that cater to health-related needs.

[[File:Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center Burbank 1.jpg|thumb|Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank.]]

In 1943, the Sisters of Providence Health System, a Catholic non-profit group, founded Providence St. Joseph Medical Center. Construction of the hospital proved difficult due to World War II restrictions on construction materials, and in particular the lack of structural steel. But the challenges were met and the one-story hospital was erected to deal with wartime restrictions. During the baby boom of the 1950s, the hospital expanded from the original 100 beds to 212. By 2012, the hospital featured 431 licensed beds and ranked as the second-largest hospital serving the San Fernando and Santa Clarita Valleys. The hospital employs about 2,500 employees and 600-plus physicians.

In the mid-1990s, Seattle-based Sisters of Providence Health System, which owns St. Joseph in Burbank, renamed the hospital Providence St. Joseph Medical Center. The medical center has several centers on campus with specialized disciplines. Cancer, cardiology, mammogram, hospice and children's services are some of the specialty centers. The newest addition to the medical center's offerings is the Roy and Patricia Disney Family Cancer Center, which opened in February 2010. The cancer center features four stories of the latest in high-tech equipment to treat cancer patients and provide wellness services. The center, estimated to cost in excess of $36 million, was built with money from the family of Roy E. Disney, the nephew of Walt Disney. [[Roy E. Disney]] died in December 2009 of stomach cancer.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.dailynews.com/ci_14281861 | title = Disney Family Cancer Center set to open February 8 | work = [[Los Angeles Daily News]] | first = Susan | last = Abram | date = January 27, 2010 | access-date = January 31, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100131100712/http://www.dailynews.com/ci_14281861 | archive-date = January 31, 2010 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref>
