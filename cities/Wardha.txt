'''Wardha'''{{Efn|[[ISO 15919|ISO]]: ''Vardhā''}} is a [[city]] and a [[municipal council]] in [[Wardha district]] in the Indian [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Maharashtra]]. The administrative headquarter of Wardha district is situated here. Wardha gets its name from the [[Wardha River]] which flows on the northern, western and southern boundaries of the district. Founded in 1866, the town is now an important centre for [[cotton]] trade. Wardha was an important part of the Gandhian era.

== History ==
Wardha was included in the empire of the [[Maurya]]s, [[Shunga Empire|Shungas]], [[Satavahana]]s and [[Vakataka]]s. Pravarapura, modern Pavnar, was once the capital of the [[Vakataka dynasty]]. Vakatakas were contemporaries of the Imperial Guptas. [[Prabhavatigupta]], the daughter of [[Chandragupta II]] (Vikramaditya), was married to the Vakataka ruler [[Rudrasena I (Vakataka king)|Rudrasena]]. The period of the Vakatakas was from the 2nd to the 5th century [[Common Era|CE]]. The empire stretched from the Arabian Sea in the west to the Bay of Bengal in the east, and from the [[Narmada River]] in the north to the Krishna-Godavari delta in the south.

Later on, Wardha was ruled by the [[Chalukya]]s, [[Rashtrakuta]]s, [[Yadava dynasty|Yadavas]], the [[Delhi Sultanate]], the [[Bahamani Sultanate]], the Muslim ruler of Berar, Gonds and [[Maratha]]s. Raja [[Bakht Buland Shah]] of Gond Dynasty, Raghuji of Bhonsale were the prominent rulers in the Medieval period.

During the 1850s Wardha district, (then a part of [[Nagpur district]]) fell into the hands of the British who included Wardha in the Central Province. In 1862, it was separated for convenient administrative purposes, and Kawatha near [[Pulgaon]] became the district headquarters. In 1866, the district headquarters was moved to Palakwadi village. The huts in the village were destroyed and a new city was constructed by English town-planner Sir Bachelor and Sir [[Reginald Craddock]]. This new city was named Wardha after the river Wardha which flows through the district.

Wardha has an adjacent city, [[Sevagram]], and both were major centers for the [[Indian Independence Movement]], especially as the location for an annual meeting of the [[Indian National Congress]] in 1934, and [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s Ashram.

Wardha was one of the pre-planned cities of British India. The town-planners were Sir Reginald Craddock and Sir Bachelor. In Craddock's memory, his name was given to the district's biggest school and an important road was named after Sir Bachelor in the British period. The Craddock School was renamed Mahatma Gandhi School. The District Hospital was named King George Hospital, but was renamed later on. The stone in which the old name was carved was at the main gate for more than a century. It was hidden by a new name board reading District Hospital. There are many buildings from the British period in the city, including the Z.P. old building, the Central Jail, the Church at Bajajwadi, and the Christian cemetery.
The owners of Powale group and Dhandre group come from Wardha.

== Transport ==
[[File:Railway map of Wardha.jpg|thumb|This map shows railway stations in Wardha and its outskirts.]]

Wardha city is well-connected by roads to the other cities of Maharashtra. National Highway No.361 (Nagpur-Wardha-Yavatmal-Nanded-Latur-Tuljapur) passes through the city. Nagpur-Aurangabad-Mumbai Express Highway also passes through it. Former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis' dream project Samruddhi Mahamarg or Nagpur-Mumbai Communication Super Expressway will also pass from the outskirts of the city.

Wardha city is well-connected to most of the parts of India by railways. [[Wardha railway station]] is an important [[rail junction]] on the [[Howrah-Nagpur-Mumbai line]]. The town is also connected to the southern part of the country through [[Sevagram railway station]]. Traffic on the Mumbai-Kolkata route is mainly dealt with at Wardha Station, and traffic on the Delhi-Chennai route is dealt with at [[Sewagram Junction railway station|Sewagram Station]] (formerly Wardha East station).{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} A new [[Wardha–Nanded line]] via [[Yavatmal]], [[Pusad]], and [[Deoli, Maharashtra|Deoli]] is being constructed.

== Economy ==
Cotton farming and soybean cultivation in Kharif is quite common. The government has provided canals to irrigate during [[Rabi crop|Rabi season]] when [[bengal gram]] (chickpea) becomes a popular choice to sow.

Many institutions are encouraging farmers to go natural or organic, but the lack of support systems either with the availability of techniques or the marketability of this produce is preventing the spread of this movement.

Wardha is becoming the second industrial hub of the [[Vidarbha]] area.[http://dcmsme.gov.in/old/dips/wardha%20dips%2012-13.pdf] This is due to its geographical location and good rail and road connectivity. In the last few decades, many companies and industrial plants were established there. Some of the major industrial plants include steel and powerplant factories.

After spending two years in jail, he travelled around India and, at the invitation of the Gandhian industrialist [[Jamnalal Bajaj]], stayed for some time in Wardha City at Jamnalal's bungalow.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Desai|first1=Mahadev|title=Day-to-day with Gandhi: Secretary's Diary|date=1968|publisher=Mahadev Haribhai Desai|doi=10.1177/097492846902500124|s2cid=151164862}}</ref> In 1936, at the age of 67, Gandhiji moved to a village (which he subsequently called Sewagram - Hindi for village of service) at the outskirts of Wardha and started to live here in a group of huts with his wife [[Kasturba]] and other disciples. This slowly grew into an ashram, where Gandhi lived with his followers for the next twelve years, until his death. The premises are very calming. Many personal items used by Gandhi and his contemporaries are preserved here including his spectacles, telephone, notebook, tables, mats, etc...<ref>{{cite web|title=The history of Sewagram|url=http://www.gandhiashramsevagram.org/|website=gandhiashramsevagram.org/|publisher=The Gandhi Ashram, Sevagram (Official website)|access-date=17 June 2014}}</ref>

He started the [[Bhoodan Movement]]. It was also the starting point of ''[[Quit India Movement|Bharat Chhodo Andolan]]''. Pawnar is an ancient city dating back to Mahabharata. During the [[Nagpur kingdom|Bhonsle]] reign Pawnar was the [[Vidarbha Kingdom]]'s most important military station. During excavation for the construction of the ashram, many sculptures and idols were found which are kept at the ashram which is open to visitors.

The Kelzar Ganpati Mandir is about {{convert|26|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Wardha on the Nagpur Road. This temple is on a hill and is surrounded by forests and hills near the Bor National Tiger Reserve and Bird Sanctuary. It is a historical place and its history goes back to Vashishtha Purana.

The place is also mentioned in ''[[Mahabharata]]'' as Ekchakranagari. According to myth, Pandavas lived here during {{transl|hi|agyatvas}}. Bhima killed Bakasura at this place and threw him down this hill. An ancient cave where Bakasura lived is at foot of the hill and his famous well is also nearby. This well has sculptured stones on its inner wall and stairs. Remains of an old fort are also seen here. Finding sculptures during digging for any purpose is common. Sculptures relating to Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism have been found,  the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is not paying attention to this. Many sculptures have been ruined due to lack of proper care. Some sculptures can be seen in this temple, on a nearby hillock, the [[gram panchayat]] office, the Buddha Vihar.
