{{History of Afghanistan}}
{{Further|History of Afghanistan}}

===Ancient and medieval===
Known at the time by names such as [[Nagara (ancient city)|Nagarhara]] and Adinapur, Jalalabad was a major center of [[Greco-Buddhist art|Greco-Buddhist]] culture during the late [[1st millennium BCE]], focused on sites such as [[Ahin Posh]].

The first surviving references to the city are in early 1st millennium CE accounts by visiting [[Chinese people|Chinese]] Buddhist monks. In or about 400 CE, [[Faxian]] visited "Nagarhara" and worshiped at sacred Buddhist sites, such as the "Cave of the Buddha's Shadow” (佛影窟).<ref>{{cite book |chapter=The Hephthalites in Tokharistan and Northwest India |first=Shoshin |last=Kuwayama |title=India and Central Asia |editor-first=Xinru |editor-last=Liu |publisher=Permanent Black |page=240 |isbn=978-8178243474|year=2012 }}</ref> In 630 CE, [[Xuanzang|Xuan Zang]], visited "Adinapur" and other locations nearby.

The Buddhist era began to end after the region was [[Muslim conquests of Afghanistan|conquered by Muslim forces]] during the late 1st Millennium. However, conversions to Islam evidently  did not occur quickly. In ''[[Hudud ul-'alam|Hudud-al-Alam]]'', written in 982 CE, there is reference to a village near Jalalabad where the local king had Muslim, Buddhist and [[Hindu]] wives.<ref>{{cite book |first=Willem |last=Vogelsang |title=The Afghans |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2002 |page=18 |isbn=978-0-631-19841-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9kfJ6MlMsJQC&pg=RA1-PA18}}</ref>

The region became part of the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid Empire]] in the 10th century. [[Sabuktigin]] annexed the land all the way west of the [[Neelum River]] in Kashmir. "The Afghans and Khiljies who resided among the mountains having taken the oath of allegiance to Sabuktigin, many of them were enlisted in his army, after which he returned in triumph to [[Ghazni]]."<ref name=Farishta-2>{{cite web |work=[[Ferishta]], History of the Rise of Mohammedan Power in India, Volume 1: Section 15 |url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=06901021&ct=13 |title=AMEER NASIR-OOD-DEEN SUBOOKTUGEEN |publisher=Packard Humanities Institute |access-date=2012-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514092123/http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=06901021&ct=13 |archive-date=2013-05-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[Ghurids]] succeeded the Ghaznavids and expanded the Islamic empire further into Hindustan. The region around Jalalabad later became part of the [[Khalji dynasty|Khalji]] territory, followed by that of the [[Timurids]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hewitt |first1=Cooper |title=Afghanistan {{!}} Countries {{!}} Collection of Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum |url=https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/countries/23424739/ |website=collection.cooperhewitt.org |access-date=26 January 2021 |archive-date=20 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210420015105/https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/countries/23424739/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Modern===
It is said that the original name of Jalalabad was '''Adinapur or Nagar(a)hara'''.<ref>Gazetteer of the Peshawar District 1897–98 Page 55</ref> Jalalabad was named in the last decade of the sixteenth century in honour of Mughal ruler [[Jalal-uddin Mohammad Akbar]], the grandson of the founder of the [[Mughal Empire]]: [[Babur]]. Babur had chosen the site for this city which was built by his grandson in 1560.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Adamec|first1=Ludwig W.|title=Historical Dictionaries of Asia, Oceania, and the Middle East : Historical Dictionary of Afghanistan|date=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810878150|page=264}}</ref>

It remained part of the Mughal Empire until around 1738 when [[Nader Shah]] and his [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid forces]] defeated the Mughals. Nader Shah's forces were accompanied by the young [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] and his 4,000-strong Afghan army from southern Afghanistan. In 1747, he founded the [[Durrani Empire]] (Afghan Empire) after re-conquering the area. The Afghan army has long used the city while going back and forth during their military campaigns into the [[South Asia|Indian-subcontinent]].

In 1834, [[Dost Mohammad Khan]] subjugated Jalalabad in his [[Dost Mohammad's Campaign to Jalalabad (1834)|campaign to Jalalabad]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Noelle |first=Christine |title=State and Tribe in Nineteenth Century Afghanistan The Reign of Amir Dost Muhammad Khan (1826-1863)|publisher=Psychology Press |year=1997 |isbn=9781138982871 |pages=15 |language=English}}</ref>

The British-Indian forces invaded Jalalabad in 1838, during the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]]. In the 1842 [[Battle of Jellalabad]], [[Wazir Akbar Khan|Akbar Khan]] besieged the [[British troops]] on their way to Jalalabad. In 1878, during the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]], the British again invaded and set up camps in Jalalabad but withdrew two years later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Jalalabad|title=Jalālābād {{!}} Afghanistan|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-02-18|archive-date=2019-03-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323001158/https://www.britannica.com/place/Jalalabad|url-status=live}}</ref>

Jalalabad is considered one of the most important cities of the [[Pashtun culture]]. Seraj-ul-Emarat, the residence of Amir [[Habibullah Khan|Habibullah]] and King [[Amanullah Khan|Amanullah]] was destroyed in 1929 when [[Habibullah Kalakani]] rose to power; the other sanctuaries however, retain vestiges of the past. The [[mausoleum]] of both rulers is enclosed by a garden facing Seraj-ul-Emart. The [[Sulemankhils]], a Pashtun family famous for their [[scientific research]], is from Jalalabad. Other celebrated Pashtun families originate from the villages near Jalalabad too.

In the 1960s and 1970s, construction started on a new [[planned city]] called Reg-e Shamshad Khan.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://medium.com/@sultanghani/afghanistan-through-a-lifetime-with-hashmat-ghani-part-2-7e0d72b4f278|title = Afghanistan, through a lifetime with Hashmat Ghani: Part 2|date = 6 July 2020|access-date = 2 September 2021|archive-date = 2 September 2021|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210902162912/https://medium.com/@sultanghani/afghanistan-through-a-lifetime-with-hashmat-ghani-part-2-7e0d72b4f278|url-status = live}}</ref>

From 1978 to early 1990s, the city served as a strategic location for the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-backed [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]]. In March 1989, two [[Afghan mujahideen|Mujahideen]] rebel factions backed by Pakistan and the U.S. assaulted the city during the [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1989–1992)|Battle of Jalalabad]]. However [[Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|government forces]] managed to drive them out within two months, which was a major setback to the resistance fighters and the ISI.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1989/07/08/afghanistan-rebels-lose-key-battle/074ff765-327d-4a60-b8ab-ed118a87ba50/|title=AFGHANISTAN REBELS LOSE KEY BATTLE|first=James|last=Rupert|date=8 July 1989|access-date=28 January 2018|via=www.WashingtonPost.com|archive-date=8 October 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231008154605/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1989/07/08/afghanistan-rebels-lose-key-battle/074ff765-327d-4a60-b8ab-ed118a87ba50/|url-status=live}}</ref> The city was heavily bombarded and hundreds of [[civilian]]s were killed.

[[File:Aerial view of Jalalabad in 2012.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Jalalabad in 2012]]
After the resignation of [[List of Presidents of Afghanistan|President]] [[Mohammad Najibullah|Najibullah]], Jalalabad quickly fell to mujahideen rebels of [[Yunus Khalis]] on April 19, 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/04/19/Afghan-rebels-capture-Jalalabad/1540703656000/|title=Afghan rebels capture Jalalabad|website=UPI.com|access-date=28 January 2018|archive-date=28 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128021110/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/04/19/Afghan-rebels-capture-Jalalabad/1540703656000/|url-status=live}}</ref> On September 12, 1996, the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (1996–2001)|Taliban]] took control of the city until they were toppled by the US-backed Afghan forces in late 2001.

The [[economy of Afghanistan|economy]] of Jalalabad gradually increased in the last decade. Many of the city's population began joining the [[Afghan National Security Forces]]. Construction has also increased. The [[Jalalabad Airport]] has long served as a [[military base]] for the [[Resolute Support Mission|NATO forces]].

==Flora and fauna==
Jalalabad is home to a large number of fruits. Various types of citrus fruits like [[orange (fruit)|orange]], [[tangerine]], [[grapefruit]], [[lemon]], [[lime (fruit)|lime]] grow in gardens as well as in orchards.<ref name="Michel"/> The orange trees yield a crop only once in three years. The ''narindj'' variety of orange is the most common one which has yellow skin and its taste is a combination of orange and grapefruit. The grapefruits grown here have a diameter of eight or nine inches. Per year 1800 tonnes of pomegranates, 334 tonnes of grapes, and 7750 tonnes of mulberries are produced in Jalalabad.<ref>Michel, p.32</ref> The fruits are either sold in local markets or transported to [[Kabul]] markets from where they are exported. The second most common crop is local ''vatani'' variety of sugarcane. It contains 15% sugar by weight.<ref>Michel, p.33</ref> Jalalabad also has the largest [[date palm|date farm]] in Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://pajhwok.com/2021/09/09/nangarhar-to-produce-15-tonnes-of-dates-this-year/ |title=Nangarhar to produce 15 tonnes of dates this year |work=Pajhwok Afghan News |date=September 9, 2021 |access-date=2022-08-26 |archive-date=2021-09-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910194539/https://pajhwok.com/2021/09/09/nangarhar-to-produce-15-tonnes-of-dates-this-year/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Jalalabad is connected by main roads with the Afghan capital of Kabul, the city of Peshawar in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], Pakistan, and several nearby Afghan cities and towns. All trade between Afghanistan and Pakistan passes through this city. The highway between Jalalabad and Kabul was resurfaced in 2006, reducing the transit time between these two important cities. This highway is considered to be one of the most dangerous in the world because of the large number of accidents.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/08/world/asia/08road.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220103/https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/08/world/asia/08road.html |archive-date=2022-01-03 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=A Highway in Afghanistan Presents Scenes of Beauty and Death|first=Dexter|last=Filkins|newspaper=The New York Times|date=7 February 2010|access-date=28 January 2018}}{{cbignore}}</ref> An improvement in the road networks between Jalalabad and Peshawar has also been proposed,{{by whom|date=August 2014}} with the intention of widening the existing road and improving security to attract more tourists and allow for safer passage of goods between to the two countries.

The province is represented in domestic cricket competitions by the Nangarhar province cricket team. National team member Hamid Hasan was born in the province and he currently represents Afghanistan in international cricket. The [[Ghazi Amanullah International Cricket Stadium]] is the first international standard cricket stadium in Afghanistan. It is located in the [[Ghazi Amanullah Town]], a modern suburb on the southeastern fringe of Jalalabad in Nangarhar Province. Construction on the stadium began in March 2010 when the foundation stone was laid by Minister of Finance and president of the [[Afghanistan Cricket Board]], Omar Zakhilwal. The project, which was developed on 30 acres of land donated by the developer constructing the Ghazi Amanullah Town, cost up the first phase of construction $1.8 million. The first phase, which took one year to complete, included the completion of the stadium itself. The remainder of the phases will see the construction of a pavilion, accommodation for players and administrative buildings. The stadium, which has a capacity of 14,000, was completed before the national team and under-19 team left for Canada and the Under-19 Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Ireland respectively. The two sides inaugurated the stadium in a [[Twenty20]] match. It is hoped that the stadium will be able to attract international teams to play Afghanistan, who currently have One Day International status until at least 2013.
