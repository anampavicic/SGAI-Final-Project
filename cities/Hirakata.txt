Eriko Aoki, author of "Korean children, textbooks, and educational practices in Japanese primary schools," stated that the city's location in proximity to both [[Osaka City]] and [[Kyoto]] contributed to its population growth of ten times its previous size<!--"tenfold"--> from around 1973 to 2013<!--40 years-->.<ref name=AokiKoreansp169170>Aoki, Eriko.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=OXBHAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA171 171].</ref>  Many Koreans in Hirakata operate their own businesses. Hirakata has the "mother's society" or "Omoni no Kai", a voluntary association of ethnic Korean mothers. It also has branches of the [[Chongryon]] and [[Mindan]], Japan's two major Korean associations. Hirakata has no particular Korean neighborhoods.<ref name=AokiKoreansp170/> There were about 3,000 ethnic Koreans in Hirakata in the pre-[[World War II]] period. In the 1930s Hirakata Koreans, fearful of keeping their own jobs, had negative attitudes towards Osaka-based Koreans who were looking for employment after having lost their jobs. Military construction was the most common job sector of that era's Korean population.<ref name=AokiKoreansp170/> Eriko Aoki stated that in 2013 there was still a sense of difference between the Koreans in Hirakata and the Koreans in Osaka.<ref name=AokiKoreansp170/>

==History==
The area of the modern city of Hirakata was within ancient [[Kawachi Province]]. The place name of "Hirakata" is very old, appearing in the ''[[Kojiki]]'', ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' and other ancient texts. During the [[Asuka period]], the early Buddhist temple of [[Kudara-dera]] indicates the settlement of many immigrants from [[Baekje]] in the [[Korean Peninsula]] from an early time. During the [[Heian period]], the hills from Katano to part of Hirakata were called "Katano ga Hara" and were a hunting ground for the imperial family and were famous for cherry blossoms. The Osaka Kaidō, an extension of the [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]] highway passed through the area, and in the [[Edo Period]] [[Hirakata-juku]] developed as a [[shukuba|post station]] on the highway and a river port on the [[Yodo River]].

The Hirakata Town was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889.  Hirakata was elevated to city status on August 1, 1947. On April 1, 2001, Hirakata was designated as a [[Special cities of Japan|special city of Japan]]. On April 1, 2014, Hirakata became a Core city with increased local autonomy.

==Government==
Hirakata has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 32 members. Hirakata, together with neighboring Katano, contributes four members to the [[Osaka Prefectural Assembly]]. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Osaka 11th district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Hirakata's modern industry began with the munitions industry supplying to the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and numerous civilian textile and clothing manufacturers. In early March 1939, a site associated with the arms industry blew up, killing 500 people.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hugh |first1=Byas |title=Village Wiped Out in Japanese Blast |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1939/03/02/91552963.pdf?pdf_redirect=true&ip=0 |access-date=1 October 2023 |work=New York Times |date=2 March 1939}}</ref> In the post-war era, the former munitions plants were transformed into [[industrial park]]s, or public housing complexes to support Hirakata's growth as a [[commuter town]] for Osaka and Kyoto. Textile and clothing production remain major industries in Hirakata.
