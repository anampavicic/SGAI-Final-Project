===Migrants===
Jute mills drew in a large labour force from the neighbouring states of Bihar and Orissa, as well as eastern Uttar Pradesh, quite often forming an overwhelming majority of the population in the area, living in [[shanty town]]s and bustees dotting the mill area. The proportion of migrants in the population was 80% in Bhadreswar.<ref>Goswami, Onkar, ''Calcuttaâ€™s Economy 1918-1970 The fall from Grace'' in ''Calcutta, the Living City'', Vol II, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, p. 90, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-563697-X}}</ref>

According to a study carried out by Vidyasagar University, "Most of these industrial units were located in riverine towns. A few of these were old towns inhabited previously by middle class Bengali 'babus' while others were new towns grown out of agricultural lands... Agriculture in Bengal was more remunerative than work in the jute mills but what the jute mills paid was enough to attract labour from Bihar, Orissa, U.P. first and then from C.P. or even Madras...The industrial 'mohallas' remained as '[[ghetto]]s'. There was little or no interconnection or social and cultural contact between local Bengali population and the mill hands. Both lived in their own worlds."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://inet.vidyasagar.ac.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/1245/2/2.pdf  | title = Industrialisation and Emergence of Labour Force in Bengal during The Colonial Period: Its Socio-Economic Impact | first = Nirban |last= Basu  | publisher = Vidyasagar University Journal of History, Vol 1, 2012-13  | access-date =  16 July 2018}}</ref>
