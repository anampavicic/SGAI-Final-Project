'''Ede''' ({{IPA|nl|ˈeːdə|-|Nl-Ede.ogg}}) is a [[town]] and [[Municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] in the [[Netherlands]], in the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[Gelderland]]. {{As of|2021|07|01|post=,}} Ede had 119,186 inhabitants.

== Population centres ==
[[File:Ede-plaats-OpenTopo.jpg|255px|thumb|Dutch topographic map of Ede (town), March 2014]]

'''Community''': 
* Ede (town)
* [[Bennekom]]
* [[De Klomp]]
* [[Deelen]]
* [[Ederveen]]
* [[Harskamp]]
* [[Hoenderloo]]
* [[Lunteren]]
* [[Otterlo]] ([[Kröller-Müller Museum]])

== Location ==
[[File:2007-02-03 11.14 Ede, kerk in het centrum foto1.JPG|thumbnail|right|Ede, 'Oude Kerk']]
[[File:Walderveense molen sneeuw (2).jpg|thumbnail|right|Walderveen Windmill]]
The town itself is situated halfway between the larger cities of [[Arnhem]] and [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], with direct rail and road connections to both cities. There are no connections to any water nearby; however, there also is a direct road connection to the city of [[Wageningen]] which hosts a small industrial port on the river [[Rijn]] and a direct road and rail connection to the city of Arnhem, which features a larger port at a greater distance. The environment is clean and green due to the fact that Ede is partly built in a forest and partly on the central Dutch plains in the national park called [[Nationaal Park De Hoge Veluwe|Nationaal Park "De Hoge Veluwe"]].

== Economy ==
Economically, the town of Ede is doing fairly well thanks to the proximity of major highways and railways which offer fast connections to the [[port of Rotterdam]], [[Schiphol]] airport and the [[Ruhr Area]] in [[Germany]]. The main sources of employment used to be a factory belonging to the Dutch Enka company and the three military bases situated in the east of the town. The factory, however, has been closed and the military bases are largely underused since [[conscription]] was abolished. The town's economy is lately becoming more focused on national tourism from the more densely populated western cities like [[Amsterdam]] and [[The Hague]], and on education such as local colleges and the large [[Wageningen University]] in the city of [[Wageningen]].

Some of the more notable or larger companies and other employers in and around Ede are:

* [[Fruit juice]] and drinks-factory [[:nl:Riedel (drankenfabrikant)|Riedel (juices and fruit drinks)]].

=== Social life ===
Each year, in the last week of August, there is a municipality-wide celebration called [[Heideweek]] (''Week of the heather''). It largely involves traditional Dutch festivities, along with local customs. During the week, a ''Queen of the heather'' and a ''Princess of the heather'' are elected from several candidates and will be the representative for the municipality of Ede on various other festivities, until next year when a new queen and princess are elected.
