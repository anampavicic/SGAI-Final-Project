==History==

=== 19th century ===
When the missionary [[Johann Ludwig Krapf]] passed through Weldiya in April 1842, it was the headquarters of [[Dejazmach]] [[Faris Aligas]] and his brother [[Birru Aligas|Birru]]. They were absent at the time of Krapf's visit, raiding the territories of Imam Liban of the Were Himano.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/journalsofrevmes00isen/journalsofrevmes00isen_djvu.txt ''Journals of the Rev. Messrs. Isenberg and Krapf, Missionaries of the Church Missionary Society, Detailing their proceedings in the kingdom of Shoa, and journeys in other parts of Abyssinia, in the years 1839, 1840, 1841 and 1842''], (London, 1843), p. 443</ref>

As early as 1890, Weldiya was the administrative center of [[Yejju Province]]. Its Tuesday market was well known for its mules.<ref name="NAI-web">[http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/vw/ORTWEL.pdf "Local History in Ethiopia"]) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 19 November 2007)</ref>

=== 20th century ===
Weldiya was attacked in 1948 by farmers who were disgruntled after their appeals over their loss of land were ignored. They seized the prison in Weldiya and freed the prisoners. Despite this success, the revolt was eventually put down.<ref>{{cite book |last= Bahru Zewde|title= A History of Modern Ethiopia|url= https://archive.org/details/historyofmoderne00bahr|url-access= registration|year= 2001|edition=second|publisher= James Currey|location= Oxford|isbn=0-85255-786-8|page = [https://archive.org/details/historyofmoderne00bahr/page/218 218]}}</ref> On 16–17 November 1988 Weldiya was subjected to an aerial attack by the [[Derg]], but no deaths were reported.<ref>Africa Watch Report, [https://www.hrw.org/reports/pdfs/e/ethiopia/ethiopia907.pdf ''Ethiopia: "Mengistu has Decided to Burn Us like Wood": Bombing of Civilians and Civilian Targets by the Air Force''], 24 July 1990</ref>
