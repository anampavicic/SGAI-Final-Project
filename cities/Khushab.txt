The city of Khushab is the location of the [[Khushab Nuclear Complex]],<ref>[http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/pakistan/facility/khushab.htm Special Weapons Program of Pakistan], Federation of American Scientists website</ref> a critical part of Pakistan's Special Weapons Programme.<ref>Shahzeb Jillani, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/south_asia/5212718.stm "South Asia arms race - is it paranoia?"], ''BBC News'', 25 July 2006</ref>

==Demographics==
The population, according to the 1901 census, was 11,403. Now it is 50,000.<ref>[https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V15_304.gif Khushāb Town] in ''Imperial Gazetteer of India'', v. 15, p. 298.</ref>

==Etymology==
"Khushab" is a combination of two [[Persian language|Persian]] words: ''khush'' ({{langx|fa|{{Nastaliq|خُوش}}}}), meaning "sweet or tasty", and ''aab'' ({{langx|fa|{{Nastaliq|آب}}}}), meaning "water". A common belief is that the [[Persian people|Persians]] from the west first used the word ''khush-aab'' in admiration of the sweet and tasty water found in the historical city situated on the bank of [[Jhelum River]]. In time the city became known as Khushab.<ref name="etym">{{cite web |url=http://khushab.dc.lhc.gov.pk/?page_id=1335 |title= District Courts Khushab|access-date= 24 December 2013}}</ref>
== Ecosystem ==

=== Olive cultivation ===
According to local farmers in Pakistan, there is untapped potential in olive cultivation and oil production, which could reduce the country's reliance on imported edible oil. The Pothohar region in Punjab is most suitable for olive cultivation, with wild olives found abundantly in several areas. However, for good yields, modern irrigation systems, proper drainage, and adequate fertilizers are required.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-11-07 |title=The untapped potential of olive cultivation |url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/2385050/the-untapped-potential-of-olive-cultivation |access-date=2023-03-16 |website=The Express Tribune |language=en}}</ref> Additionally, specific varieties of the plant such as Ottobratica, Coratina, Frantoio, Leccino, and Mirailo, best for olive oil extraction and commercial production, should be planted.  

=== Plantation drive ===
The Capital Development Authority planned to plant 5,000 saplings in Islamabad on Independence Day in accordance with the Clean and Green Pakistan campaign. Various areas were allocated a different number of saplings to plant, and citizens, students, and organizations participated in the plantation drive. The Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad also planted 1,000 saplings across the city. This initiative aimed to increase Pakistan's forest cover and mitigate the effects of climate change.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-08-14 |title=5,000 saplings to be planted on Independence Day |url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/2371083/5000-saplings-to-be-planted-on-independence-day |access-date=2023-03-16 |website=The Express Tribune |language=en}}</ref>

== Development projects ==
In October 2022, Pakistani government approved over Rs10 billion for the execution of various uplift projects in the country's different districts, including water supply schemes, the construction of small dams, the rehabilitation of schools and other development projects. The funds were allocated during the National Economic Council meeting, which was chaired by the Prime Minister. The government aims to complete these projects on a priority basis to ensure the socio-economic development of the country.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-10-18 |title=Govt approves over Rs10b for uplift schemes |url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/2382156/govt-approves-over-rs10b-for-uplift-schemes |access-date=2023-03-16 |website=The Express Tribune |language=en}}</ref>

=== Jalalpur Canal ===
In the beginning of 2023, the Punjab Irrigation Department aimed to complete the repair and extension work of Jalalpur Canal, a water source for domestic and irrigation purposes in Jhelum, within six months. The canal's extension would provide more than 4,000 acres of land to farmers for irrigation purposes. To speed up the work, the government approved the allocation of Rs. 200 million to the department.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Reporter |first=The Newspaper's Staff |date=2023-01-05 |title=Jalalpur canal to be operational in six months |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1729921 |access-date=2023-03-16 |website=DAWN.COM |language=en}}</ref>

=== Bauxite reserves ===
The government of Pakistan approved a plan to extract bauxite reserves and utilize them to bolster the country's industrial sector and foreign reserves. A memorandum of understanding had been signed between the government and a Chinese company for the mining and processing of bauxite reserves in the country's southern region. This move is expected to create job opportunities and promote industrial development, helping to stabilize Pakistan's economy.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-01-27 |title=Bauxite extraction to shore up industry, foreign reserves |url=https://www.nation.com.pk/27-Jan-2023/bauxite-extraction-to-shore-up-industry-foreign-reserves |access-date=2023-03-16 |website=The Nation |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Bauxet reserves |url=https://www.cgs.gov.cn/upload/201510/20151019/20151019161650443.pdf}}</ref>
