{{Cleanup section |reason=too much detail |date=July 2023 }}
The Jönköping municipality has its headquarters in a place called {{lang|sv|rådhuset}}. {{lang|sv|Rådhuset}} is an important component of the function of the municipality as it works as a state office for different departments of and in Jönköping. {{lang|sv|Rådhuset}} is dependent on the municipality but is its own entity, the head of the {{lang|sv|rådhuset}} has political power but is not the head of the Jönköping state. The head of the Jönköping state is called the {{lang|sv|kommunfullmäktige}} which has all the municipal power but sometimes doesn't make the decisions; these are handed down to other departments or the {{lang|sv|kommunstyrelsen}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.jonkoping.se/kommunpolitik/kommunensorganisation/forvaltningar/stadskontoret.4.74fef9ab15548f0b800fc1.html |title=Stadskontoret |trans-title=The City Administration |access-date=31 October 2022 |archive-date=31 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221031192837/https://www.jonkoping.se/kommunpolitik/kommunensorganisation/forvaltningar/stadskontoret.4.74fef9ab15548f0b800fc1.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Sofiakyrkan, Jönköping.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sofia Church, Jönköping|Sofia Church]] in Jönköping, [[Neo-Gothic]] style, 1888]]
Jönköping is an old trading centre (''[[Köping]]'') situated at a natural crossroads for routes following the rivers [[Nissan (river)|Nissan]] and [[Lagan River (Sweden)|Lagan]], and the road connecting the provinces of [[Östergötland]] and [[Västergötland]], a result of the town's geographical position at the southern end of lake Vättern, which divides the two provinces.

On 18 May 1284 Jönköping became the first [[City in Sweden]] to be granted its rights by king [[Magnus Ladulås]], who ruled mostly from Vättern's largest island [[Visingsö]].{{clarify|date=June 2021}} The first part of the city's name, "Jön", is derived from a creek, "Junebäcken", in Talavid, in what is now the western part of the city. The second part of the name "köping", is, as mentioned above, an old word for a trading centre or market place.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Svenskt ortnamnslexikon |url=http://www.sprakochfolkminnen.se/download/18.5850f85e15732ead0b325e/1474034387007/Svenskt+ortnamslexikon.pdf |page=158 |editor-last=Wahlberg |editor-first=Mats |edition=1st |date=2003 |location=Uppsala |publisher=[[Swedish Institute for Dialectology, Onomastics and Folklore Research]] |language=sv |isbn=91-7229-020-X |access-date=2017-01-22 }}</ref>

The geographical position of the city also left it vulnerable to attack via the river routes that led south, mainly from [[Denmark|Danes]]. At that time the provinces of what is today southern Sweden – [[Skåne|Scania]], [[Halland]] and [[Blekinge]] – belonged to Denmark. The city was plundered and burned several times until it was fortified during the 16th and 17th centuries.

Jönköping was known for its [[match]]stick industry between 1845 and 1970.<ref>{{cite book | last =Ohlsen | first =Becky | last2 =Kaminski | first2 =Anna | last3 =Lundgren  | first3 =K | title =Lonely Planet Sweden | publisher =Lonely Planet | edition = 5th | date =1 June 2012 | isbn =978-1741797268}}</ref> The phosphorus match was invented in 1831, and these matches became very popular because one could strike it against any surface to ignite it. However, the problem was that they ignited too easily, caused a lot of accidents and were toxic. In 1844, Swedish professor [[Gustaf Erik Pasch | Gustav Erik Pasch]] patented a new invention, "Safety matches – Strike against the box only".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wisniak|first=Jaime|date=May 2005|title=Matches-The manufacture of fire|url=http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/8636|journal=CSIR|volume=12|issue=3|pages=369–380|via=NISCAIR}}</ref> To prevent the matches from igniting so easily, Gustav Erik Pasch separated the chemicals in the match head and placed the phosphorus on a separate surface on the outside of the box for striking ignition. Johan Edvard and Carl Frans Lundström took Pasch's patent and improved it. Later, they manufactured their new Safety matches in their factory in Jönköping.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.swedishmatchindustries.com/Products/Swedish-matches/History-of-matches/|title=History of matches|website=Swedish Match|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref> Today, the [[Match Museum]] is located in Jönköping's first match factory.

==Present==
The urban area of Jönköping today includes the eastern industrial town of [[Huskvarna]], with which it has grown together.<ref>{{cite web | title=Ortshistoria Huskvarna | website=ortshistoria.se | date=2008-01-14 | url=http://ortshistoria.se/stad/huskvarna/historia | language=sv | access-date=2023-12-14}}</ref>

[[Elmia]], a major trade fair and exhibition centre, is situated in Jönköping. [[Elmia Wood]] is the world's largest forestry fair,<ref>{{cite web | title=Elmia Wood | website=JKPG.com | url=https://jkpg.com/en/ovriga-omraden/elmia-wood/#:~:text=Elmia%20Wood%20is%20the%20world's,swedish%20forest%20south%20of%20J%C3%B6nk%C3%B6ping. | access-date=2023-12-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Elmia Wood back on in person for 2022 | website=Wood Business | date=2022-02-07 | url=https://www.woodbusiness.ca/elmia-wood-back-on-in-person-for-2022/ | access-date=2023-12-14}}</ref> and fairs for subcontractors, trucks, caravans and railways are the biggest of their kind in Europe. Since 2001, Elmia has been the site of the world's largest [[LAN party]], [[DreamHack]], with two events every year, Dreamhack Summer and Dreamhack Winter.

The city is an important Nordic logistical center, with many companies' central warehouses (such as [[Elkjøp]], [[IKEA]], [[Electrolux]] and [[Husqvarna AB|Husqvarna]]) situated there.<ref>{{cite web | title=Jönköping växer som logistikläge | website=Intelligent Logistik | date=2017-09-15 | url=https://intelligentlogistik.com/nyhetsflode/fastigheter/jonkoping-vaxer-som-logistiklage/ | language=sv | access-date=2023-12-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Radio | first=Sveriges | title=P4 Jönköping | website=Sveriges Radio | date=2009-06-23 | url=https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/2923324 | language=sv | access-date=2023-12-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Artell | first=Text Johanna | author2=Dela artikeln | title=Smålands bästa logistikcentrum | website=Fastighetstidningen | date=2023-12-14 | url=https://fastighetstidningen.se/smalands-basta-logistikcentrum/ | language=sv | access-date=2023-12-14}}</ref>

==Climate==
Jönköping's climate was [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb'') with long, cold winters and short, warm summers during the 1961–1990 period. However, the window between subarctic and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] is very small in this marine-influenced climate type, and in recent years the climate has more resembled very cold oceanic. However, figures are slightly skewed due to the weather station being located at the airport which is at an elevation of {{convert|228|m|ft}}, whereas the city centre is at {{convert|100|m|ft}}. This likely renders up to between half a degree to a full degree milder temperatures in the urban centre.
