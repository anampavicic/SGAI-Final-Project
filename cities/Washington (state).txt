==Etymology==

Washington was named after [[President of the United States|President]] [[George Washington]] by an act of the [[United States Congress]] during the creation of [[Washington Territory]] in 1853; the territory was to be named "Columbia", for the [[Columbia River]] and the [[Columbia District]], but Kentucky representative [[Richard H. Stanton]] found the name too similar to the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] (the national capital, itself containing the city of Washington), and proposed naming the new territory after President Washington.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brier|first=Warren J.|year=1960|title=How Washington Territory Got Its Name|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40487423|journal=The Pacific Northwest Quarterly|volume=51|issue=1|pages=13–15|jstor=40487423|issn=0030-8803|access-date=September 2, 2021|archive-date=September 2, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210902180939/https://www.jstor.org/stable/40487423|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Longview History">{{Cite web |title=History |url=http://www.mylongview.com/index.aspx?page=52 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306084157/http://www.mylongview.com/index.aspx?page=52 |archive-date=March 6, 2014 |access-date=April 17, 2014 |publisher=City of Longview, WA}}</ref><ref name="Cowlitz Timeline" /> Washington is the only U.S. state named after a president.<ref>{{Cite web |date=February 15, 2016 |title=House Resolution No. 2016–4662 |url=http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/House%20Resolutions/4662-Presidents%27%20Day.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215064731/http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bills/House%20Resolutions/4662-Presidents'%20Day.pdf |archive-date=February 15, 2017 |access-date=April 4, 2017 |publisher=Washington State Legislature}}</ref>

Washington is the northwesternmost state of the [[contiguous United States]]. It borders [[Idaho]] to the east, bounded mostly by the meridian running north from the confluence of the [[Snake River]] and [[Clearwater River (Idaho)|Clearwater River]] (about 117°02'23" west), except for the southernmost section where the border follows the Snake River. Oregon is to the south, with the Columbia River forming the western part and the 46th parallel forming the eastern part of the Oregon–Washington border. During Washington's partition from Oregon, the original plan for the border followed the Columbia River east until the confluence with the Snake, and then would have followed the Snake River east; this was changed to keep [[Walla Walla County, Washington|Walla Walla]]'s fertile farmland in Washington.

To the west of Washington lies the Pacific Ocean.<ref name="Constitution">{{Cite web |title=Washington State Constitution—Article XXIV—Boundaries |url=http://www.leg.wa.gov/lawsandagencyrules/pages/constitution.aspx |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724003631/http://leg.wa.gov/LawsAndAgencyRules/Pages/constitution.aspx |archive-date=July 24, 2019 |access-date=April 17, 2014 |publisher=[[Washington State Legislature]]}}</ref> Its northern border lies mostly along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], and then via marine boundaries through the [[Strait of Georgia]], [[Haro Strait]], and [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], with the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]] to the north.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Britain and the United States agree on the 49th parallel as the main Pacific Northwest boundary in the Treaty of Oregon on June 15, 1846—HistoryLink.org |url=http://www.historylink.org/File/5247 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913182911/http://www.historylink.org/File/5247 |archive-date=September 13, 2017 |access-date=September 4, 2017 |website=Historylink.org}}</ref>

Washington is part of a region known as the [[Pacific Northwest]], a term which always refers to at least Washington and Oregon, and may or may not include some or all the following, depending on the user's intent: Idaho, western [[Montana]], [[northern California]], British Columbia, and [[Alaska]].

The high mountains of the [[Cascade Range]] run north-south, bisecting the state. In addition to [[Western Washington]] and [[Eastern Washington]], residents call the two parts of the state the "Westside" and the "Eastside", "Wet side" and "Dry side", or "Timberland" and "Wheatland", the latter pair more commonly in the names of region-specific businesses and institutions. These terms reflect the geography, climate, and industry of the land on both sides of the Cascades.

From the [[Cascade Range|Cascade Mountains]] westward, [[Western Washington]] has a mostly [[Mediterranean climate]], with mild temperatures and wet winters, autumns and springs, and relatively dry summers. The Cascade Range has several [[Cascade Volcanoes|volcanoes]], which reach altitudes significantly higher than the rest of the mountains. From north to south, these major volcanoes are [[Mount Baker]], [[Glacier Peak]], [[Mount Rainier]], [[Mount St. Helens]], and [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]]. All are active volcanoes.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Volcano Hazards including Lahars – Emergency Management|url=https://www.seattle.gov/emergency-management/hazards/volcano-hazards-including-lahars|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210902210824/https://www.seattle.gov/emergency-management/hazards/volcano-hazards-including-lahars|archive-date=September 2, 2021|access-date=September 2, 2021|website=City of Seattle, Washington Government}}</ref>

===Eastern Washington===

[[File:South Eastern Washington State.tif|thumb|Southeastern Washington]]

[[Eastern Washington]]—the part of the state east of the Cascades—has a relatively dry climate, in distinct contrast to the west side. It includes large areas of semiarid [[steppe]] and a few truly arid [[desert]]s in the [[rain shadow]] of the Cascades; the Hanford reservation receives an average annual precipitation of {{convert|6|to|7|in}}. Despite the limited amount of rainfall, [[agriculture]] is an extremely important business throughout much of Eastern Washington, as the soil is highly productive and [[irrigation]], aided by dams along the Columbia River, is fairly widespread.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Washington State Department of Agriculture|url=https://www.nasda.org/organizations/washington-state-department-of-agriculture|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210902211306/https://www.nasda.org/organizations/washington-state-department-of-agriculture|archive-date=September 2, 2021|access-date=September 2, 2021|website=National Association of State Departments of Agriculture|language=en-US}}</ref> The spread of population in Eastern Washington is dominated by access to water, especially rivers. The main cities are all located alongside rivers or lakes; most of them are named after the river or lake they adjoin.

Farther east, the climate becomes less arid, with annual rainfall increasing as one goes east to {{convert|21.2|in}} in Pullman, near the Washington–Idaho border.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pullman 2 NW, Washington Period of Record Climate summary |url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?wapull |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113111136/http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?wapull |archive-date=January 13, 2012 |access-date=September 22, 2011 |publisher=Western Regional Climate Center}}</ref> The [[Okanagan Highland|Okanogan Highlands]] and the rugged [[Kettle River Range]] and [[Selkirk Mountains]] cover much of the state's northeastern quadrant.

The state of Washington has a temperate climate. The eastern half of Washington has a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] to [[warm-summer mediterranean climate]], while the western side of Washington as well as the coastal areas of the state have a cool [[oceanic climate]] or warm-summer mediterranean climate. Major factors determining Washington's climate include the large semi-permanent [[Low-pressure area|low pressure]] and [[High-pressure area|high pressure]] systems of the north Pacific Ocean, the continental air masses of North America, and the Olympic and Cascade mountains. In the spring and summer, a high-pressure [[anticyclone]] system dominates the north Pacific Ocean, causing air to spiral out in a clockwise fashion. For Washington, this means [[prevailing winds]] from the northwest bring relatively cool air and a predictably [[dry season]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gibbens|first=Sarah|date=June 29, 2021|title=What is a heat dome?

In the autumn and winter, a low-pressure [[cyclone]] system takes over in the north Pacific Ocean. The air spiraling inward in a counter-clockwise fashion causes Washington's prevailing winds to come from the southwest, and bring cool and overcast weather and a predictably [[wet season]]. The term "[[Pineapple Express]]" is used colloquially to describe [[atmospheric river]] events, where repeated storm systems are directed by this persistent cyclone from the tropical Pacific regions a great distance into the Pacific Northwest. Western Washington is very cloudy during much of fall, winter, and early spring. [[Seattle]] averages the least sunshine hours of any major city in the United States.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kruckeberg |first=Arthur R. |title=The Natural History of Puget Sound Country |publisher=University of Washington Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-295-97477-4 |pages=42–43}}</ref>

The Southern Oscillation greatly influences weather during the cold season. During the El Niño phase, the jet stream enters the U.S. farther south through California, therefore late fall and winter are drier than normal with less snowpack. The La Niña phase reinforces the jet stream through the Pacific Northwest, causing Washington to have more rain and snow than average.<ref>{{Cite web|date=September 10, 2020|title=Washington could see La Niña winter with wetter, colder weather than normal|url=https://www.king5.com/article/weather/weather-blog/la-nina-winter-washington-pacific-northwest/281-3cb9d745-668b-46ac-bde5-cbecefbae7d7|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210902213245/https://www.king5.com/article/weather/weather-blog/la-nina-winter-washington-pacific-northwest/281-3cb9d745-668b-46ac-bde5-cbecefbae7d7|archive-date=September 2, 2021|access-date=September 2, 2021|website=KING5|language=en-US}}</ref>

====Rain shadow effects====

{{main|Rain shadow}}

[[File:Wa rain map.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Washington experiences extensive variation in rainfall.]]
Rainfall in Washington varies dramatically going from east to west. The Olympic Peninsula's western side receives as much as {{convert|160|in}} of precipitation annually, making it the wettest area of the 48 conterminous states and a [[temperate rainforest]]. Weeks may pass without a clear day. The western slopes of the Cascade Range receive some of the heaviest annual snowfall (in some places more than {{convert|200|in|disp=or|sp=us}} water equivalent) in the country. In the rain shadow area east of the Cascades, the annual precipitation is only {{convert|6|in}}. Precipitation then increases again eastward toward the Rocky Mountains (about {{Convert|120|mi|km}} east of the Idaho border).

The Olympic mountains and Cascades compound this climatic pattern by causing [[orographic lift]] of the air masses blown inland from the Pacific Ocean, resulting in the windward side of the mountains receiving high levels of precipitation and the leeward side receiving low levels. This occurs most dramatically around the Olympic Mountains and the Cascade Range. In both cases, the windward slopes facing southwest receive high precipitation and mild, cool temperatures. While the Puget Sound lowlands are known for clouds and rain in the winter, the western slopes of the Cascades receive larger amounts of precipitation, often falling as snow at higher elevations.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Climate of Washington|url=https://wrcc.dri.edu/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210902221514/https://wrcc.dri.edu/Climate/narrative_wa.php|archive-date=September 2, 2021|access-date=September 2, 2021|website=Western Regional Climate Center}}</ref> [[Mount Baker]], near the state's northern border, is one of the snowiest places in the world.

East of the Cascades, a large region experiences strong rain shadow effects. Semi-arid conditions occur in much of Eastern Washington with the strongest rain shadow effects at the relatively low elevations of the central [[Columbia Plateau]]—especially the region just east of the Columbia River from about the Snake River to the [[Okanagan Highland]]. Thus, instead of rain forests, much of Eastern Washington is covered with dry [[grassland]], [[shrub-steppe]], and [[dune]]s.

====Temperatures====

The average annual temperature ranges from {{convert|51|F}} on the Pacific coast to {{convert|40|F}} in the northeast. The lowest temperature recorded in the state was {{convert|-48|F}} in [[Winthrop, Washington|Winthrop]] and [[Mazama, Washington|Mazama]].

Forests cover about half the state's land area, mostly west of the northern Cascades. Approximately two-thirds of Washington's forested area is publicly owned, including 64 percent of federal land.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Diversity of Washington's Forests—Washington Forestland Ownership |url=http://www.wfpa.org/forest-policy/washington-forests/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140418102656/http://www.wfpa.org/forest-policy/washington-forests/ |archive-date=April 18, 2014 |access-date=July 14, 2013 |publisher=Washington Forest Protection Association}}</ref> Common trees and plants in the region are [[camassia]], Douglas fir, hemlock, [[penstemon]], ponderosa pine, [[western red cedar]], and many species of ferns.<ref>{{Cite web|year=2010|title=Washington Flora Checklist|url=http://biology.burke.washington.edu/herbarium/waflora/checklist.php|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820132700/http://biology.burke.washington.edu/herbarium/waflora/checklist.php|archive-date=August 20, 2013|access-date=July 15, 2013|website=University of Washington|publisher=University of Washington Herbarium}}</ref> The state's various areas of wilderness offer sanctuary, with substantially large populations of shorebirds and marine mammals. The Pacific shore surrounding the [[San Juan Islands]] is heavily inhabited by [[Killer whale|killer]], gray, and humpback whales.<ref name="encyclopedia" />

In Eastern Washington, the flora is vastly different. [[Tumbleweed]]s and [[sagebrush]] dominate the landscape throughout large parts of the countryside. [[Elaeagnus angustifolia|Russian olives]] and other trees are common alongside riverbanks; however, apart from the riversides, large swaths of Eastern Washington have no naturally existing trees at all (though many trees have been planted and are irrigated by people, of course). A wider variety of flora can be found in both the [[Blue Mountains (Oregon)|Blue Mountains]] and the eastern sides of the Cascades.

Mammals native to the state include the [[bat]], [[American black bear|black bear]], [[bobcat]], [[cougar]], [[coyote]], [[deer]], [[elk]], [[gray wolf]], [[hare]], [[moose]], [[mountain beaver]], [[muskrat]], [[opossum]], [[pocket gopher]], [[rabbit]], [[raccoon]], [[North American river otter|river otter]], [[skunk]], and [[tree squirrel]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Species Fact Sheets—Mammals |url=http://wdfw.wa.gov/living/mammals.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708165055/http://wdfw.wa.gov/living/mammals.html |archive-date=July 8, 2013 |access-date=July 14, 2013 |publisher=Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife}}</ref> Because of the wide range of geography, the state of Washington is home to several different ecoregions, which allow for a varied range of bird species.

They moved west in the second wave of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], leaving a high influence on West Coast [[rock music]] and [[R&B]] and [[soul music|soul]] in the 1960s, including Seattle native [[Jimi Hendrix]], a pioneer in hard rock, who was of African American and alleged [[Cherokee]] descent.

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] lived on Indian reservations or jurisdiction lands such as the [[Colville Indian Reservation]], [[Makah Reservation|Makah]], [[Muckleshoot|Muckleshoot Indian Reservation]], [[Quinault people|Quinault]], [[Salish peoples|Salish people]], [[Spokane Indian Reservation]], and [[Yakama Indian Reservation]]. The westernmost and Pacific coasts have primarily American Indian communities, such as the [[Chinook people|Chinook]], [[Lummi people|Lummi]], and [[Salish people|Salish]]. [[Urban Indian]] communities formed by the U.S. [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] relocation programs in Seattle since the end of World War II brought a variety of Native American peoples to this diverse metropolis. The city was named for [[Chief Seattle]] in the very early 1850s when European Americans settled the sound.

===Taxes===

[[File:Starbucks Headquarters Seattle.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Starbucks]] headquarters, Seattle]]

The state of Washington is one of seven states that do not levy a personal [[income tax]]. The state does not collect a [[corporate income tax]] or [[franchise tax]] either. Washington businesses are responsible for various other state levies, including the [[business and occupation tax]] (B & O), a [[gross receipts tax]] which charges varying rates for different types of businesses.

Washington's state base [[sales tax]] is 6.5%, which is combined with a local sales tax that varies by locality. The combined state and local retail sales tax rates increase the taxes paid by consumers, depending on the variable local sales tax rates, generally between 7.5% and 10%.<ref name="DORSalesTaxRates">{{Cite web |title=Local Sales and Use Tax Rates by City/County |url=https://dor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/Docs/forms/ExcsTx/LocSalUseTx/LocalSlsUseFlyer_18_Q1_alpha.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231104032/https://dor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/Docs/forms/ExcsTx/LocSalUseTx/LocalSlsUseFlyer_18_Q1_alpha.pdf |archive-date=December 31, 2017 |access-date=December 30, 2017 |publisher=Washington State Department of Revenue}}</ref> {{as of|2024}}, the combined sales tax rate in Seattle was 10.25%.

An [[excise tax]] applies to certain products such as gasoline, cigarettes, and alcoholic beverages. [[Property tax]] was the first tax levied in the state of Washington, and its collection accounts for about 30% of Washington's total state and local revenue. It continues to be the most important revenue source for [[Public school (government-funded)|public schools]], fire protection, [[Library|libraries]], parks and recreation, and other special-purpose districts.

All [[real property]] and [[personal property]] are subject to tax unless specifically exempted by law. Most personal property owned by individuals is exempt from tax. [[Personal property tax]] applies to personal property used when conducting business, or to other personal property not exempt by law. All property taxes are paid to the county treasurer's office where the property is located. Neither does the state assess any tax on retirement income earned and received from another state. Washington does not collect [[inheritance tax]]es. However, the [[estate tax]] is de-coupled from the federal estate tax laws, and therefore, the state imposes its estate tax.

In 2007, Washington became the first state in the nation to target all forms of highly toxic [[Bromine|brominated]] [[flame retardant]]s known as [[PBDE]]s for elimination from the many common household products in which they are being used. A 2004 study of 40 mothers from Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Montana found PBDEs in the breast milk of every woman tested.

Three recent studies by the [[Washington State Department of Ecology]] showed toxic chemicals banned decades ago linger in the environment and concentrate in the food chain. In one of the studies, state government scientists found unacceptable levels of toxic substances in 93 samples of freshwater fish from 45 sites. The toxic substances included [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]], [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]], two chlorinated pesticides, [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]], [[dieldrin]] and PBDEs. As a result of the study, the department will investigate the sources of PCBs in the Wenatchee River, where unhealthy levels of PCBs were found in mountain whitefish. Based on the 2007 information and a previous 2004 Ecology study, the [[Washington State Department of Health]] advises the public not to eat [[mountain whitefish]] from the [[Wenatchee River]] from [[Leavenworth, Washington|Leavenworth]] downstream to where the river joins the Columbia, due to unhealthy levels of PCBs. Study results also showed high levels of contaminants in fish tissue that scientists collected from Lake Washington and the Spokane River, where fish consumption advisories are already in effect.<ref>{{Cite web |date=June 25, 2007 |title=Toxics Persist in Washington Rivers, Lakes and Fish |url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jun2007/2007-06-25-01.asp |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604005919/http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jun2007/2007-06-25-01.asp |archive-date=June 4, 2011 |access-date=July 31, 2010 |website=Ens-newswire.com}}</ref>

[[File:United States presidential election in Washington, 2016.svg|thumb|[[Treemap]] of the popular vote by county, 2016 presidential election]]

The state is typically thought of as politically divided by the Cascade Mountains, with Western Washington being [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] (particularly the {{nowrap|[[Interstate 5 in Washington|I-5]] Corridor}}) and Eastern Washington being [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]].

Although the eastern half of the state votes heavily [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], the overwhelming [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] dominance in the [[Seattle metropolitan area]] has turned Washington into a reliably [[Red states and blue states|blue state]]. It is considered part of the [[Blue wall (U.S. politics)|Blue wall]] of states that have voted Democratic in every presidential election since [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]]. This voting streak began with Democrat [[Michael Dukakis]] narrowly capturing Washington in [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]]. The state has since turned much more solidly blue, beginning with Obama's landslide victory in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], and Democrats winning the state by double digits in every subsequent presidential election.

Washington was considered a key swing state in 1968, and it was the only western state to give its electoral votes to Democratic nominee [[Hubert Humphrey]] over his Republican opponent [[Richard Nixon]]. Washington was considered a part of the 1994 [[Republican Revolution]], and had the biggest pick-up in the house for Republicans, who picked up seven of Washington's nine House seats.<ref>{{Cite web |title=November 1994 General |url=http://www.secstate.wa.gov/elections/results_report.aspx?e=15&c=&c2=&t=&t2=1&p=&p2=&y= |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127124243/http://www.secstate.wa.gov/elections/results_report.aspx?e=15&c=&c2=&t=&t2=1&p=&p2=&y= |archive-date=November 27, 2008 |access-date=July 31, 2010 |publisher=[[Secretary of State of Washington|Washington Secretary of State]]—Elections Division}}</ref> However, this dominance did not last for long, as Democrats picked up one seat in the 1996 election,<ref>{{Cite web |title=November 1996 General |url=http://www.secstate.wa.gov/elections/results_report.aspx?e=17&c=&c2=&t=&t2=1&p=&p2=&y= |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127124212/http://www.secstate.wa.gov/elections/results_report.aspx?e=17&c=&c2=&t=&t2=1&p=&p2=&y= |archive-date=November 27, 2008 |access-date=July 31, 2010 |publisher=[[Secretary of State of Washington|Washington Secretary of State]]—Elections Division}}</ref> and two more in 1998, giving the Democrats a 5–4 majority.<ref>{{Cite web |title=November 1998 General |url=http://www.secstate.wa.gov/elections/results_report.aspx?e=10&c=&c2=&t=&t2=1&p=&p2=&y= |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127124229/http://www.secstate.wa.gov/elections/results_report.aspx?e=10&c=&c2=&t=&t2=1&p=&p2=&y= |archive-date=November 27, 2008 |access-date=July 31, 2010 |publisher=[[Secretary of State of Washington|Washington Secretary of State]]—Elections Division}}</ref>

The [[List of governors of Washington|governorship]] is held by Democrat [[Jay Inslee]], who was elected to his first term in the [[Washington gubernatorial election, 2012|2012 gubernatorial election]] and, after the 2020 election, became the first incumbent in more than 40 years to be elected for a third term. In 2013 and 2014, both houses of the [[Washington State Legislature]] (the [[Washington State Senate|Washington Senate]] and the [[Washington House of Representatives]]) were controlled by Democrats. The state senate was under Republican control, due to two Democrats' joining Republicans to form the [[Majority Coalition Caucus]]. After the 2014 elections, the Democrats retained control of the House, while Republicans took a majority in the Senate without the need for a coalition. In November 2017, a special election gave Democrats a one-seat majority in the Senate and complete control over state government. Since then, in the 2018 election, the Democrats have only expanded their majorities.

No state has gone longer without a Republican governor than [[List of Washington Governors|Washington]]. Democrats have controlled the [[Washington Governor's Mansion]] for {{Age|1985|01|16}} years; the last Republican governor was [[John Spellman]], who left office in 1985. Washington has not voted for a Republican senator, governor, or presidential candidate since 1994, tying with Delaware for the longest streak in the country.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Cohn |first=Nate |date=June 19, 2017 |title=The 15 Best-Educated Districts in the U.S., and Why It Matters in the Georgia Race |language=en-US |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/upshot/this-list-of-well-educated-districts-explains-why-georgias-election-is-close.html |url-status=live |access-date=June 19, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619131743/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/upshot/this-list-of-well-educated-districts-explains-why-georgias-election-is-close.html |archive-date=June 19, 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

[[File:Trove cannabis and coffee in Bellingham.jpg|thumb|upright|Cannabis café in [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]]. Since [[Washington Initiative 502|Initiative 502]] in 2012, it is legal to sell or possess cannabis for recreational or medical use.]]
Washington is one of the ten states to have legalized [[assisted suicide]]. In 2008, the [[Washington Death with Dignity Act]] ballot initiative passed and became law.

In November 2009, Washington voters approved full domestic partnerships via [[Referendum 71]], marking the first time voters in any state expanded recognition of same-sex relationships at the ballot box. Three years later, in November 2012, [[Same-sex marriage in Washington (state)|same-sex marriage]] was affirmed via [[Referendum 74]], making Washington one of only three states to have approved same-sex marriage by popular vote.

Also in November 2012, Washington was one of the first two states to approve the legal sale and possession of [[cannabis]] for both recreational and medical use with [[Washington Initiative 502|Initiative 502]]. Although marijuana is still illegal under U.S. federal law, persons 21 and older in Washington state can possess up to one ounce of marijuana, 16 ounces of marijuana-infused product in solid form, 72 ounces of marijuana-infused product in liquid form, or any combination of all three, and can legally consume marijuana and marijuana-infused products.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Bly |first=Laura |date=November 7, 2012 |title=Colorado, Washington OK Recreational Marijuana Use |work=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/dispatches/2012/11/07/colorado-washington-legalize-recreational-marijuana-tourism/1689269/ |url-status=live |access-date=November 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108004909/http://www.usatoday.com/story/dispatches/2012/11/07/colorado-washington-legalize-recreational-marijuana-tourism/1689269// |archive-date=November 8, 2012}}</ref>
