'''Mathura''' ({{IPA|hi|mɐ.t̪ʰʊ.ɾäː}},{{audio|Mathura.ogg|}}) is a city and the administrative headquarters of [[Mathura district]] in the [[states and union territories of India|Indian state]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. It is located {{convert|57.6|km}} north of [[Agra]], and {{convert|146|km}} south-east of [[Delhi]]; about {{convert|14.5|km}} from the town of [[Vrindavan]], and {{convert|22|km}} from [[Govardhan]]. In ancient times, Mathura was an [[economic]] hub, located at the junction of important [[caravan (travellers)|caravan]] routes. The [[2011 Census of India]] estimated the population of Mathura at 441,894.

In [[Hinduism]], the birthplace of [[Krishna]], one of the main deities in that religion, is believed to be located in Mathura at the [[Krishna Janmasthan Temple Complex]].<ref name=Prasad>{{cite book|last=Prasad|first=Dev|author-link=Dev Prasad|title=Krishna: A Journey through the Lands & Legends of Krishna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o0_5caqiUH0C&pg=PT22|year=2015|publisher=Jaico Publishing House|isbn=978-81-8495-170-7|page=22}}</ref> It is one of the [[Sapta Puri]], the seven cities considered holy by [[Hindus]], also is called Mokshyadayni Tirth. The [[Kesava Deo Temple]] was built in ancient times on the site of Krishna's birthplace (an underground [[prison]]). Mathura was the capital of the kingdom of [[Surasena]], ruled by [[Kamsa]], the maternal uncle of Krishna. Mathura is part of the [[Krishna]] circuit (Mathura, Vrindavan, [[Barsana]], [[Govardhan]], [[48 kos parikrama of Kurukshetra|Kurukshetra]], [[Dwarka]] and [[Bhalka]]). [[Krishna Janmashtami]] is grandly celebrated in Mathura every year.

Mathura has been chosen as one of the heritage cities for the [[Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana]] scheme of Government of India.<ref name=holycity/>

==History==
Traditionally it is believed that it was founded by [[Shatrughna]] after killing [[Yadava]] [[Lavana]] at the site of Madhuvana. According to [[Ramayana]] it was founded by [[Madhu]] (a man of the [[Yadu|Yadu tribe]]). Later on Madhu's son [[Lavanasura]] was defeated by Satrughana.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Prasad |first=Prakash Charan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RSW8az3Q_dEC |title=Foreign Trade and Commerce in Ancient India |date=1977 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |isbn=978-81-7017-053-2 |language=en}}</ref> Madhu says all the territory of Mathura belongs to [[Abhiras]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Institute |first=Bhandarkar Oriental Research |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-ksAQAAMAAJ |title=Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona |date=1917 |publisher=The Institute |language=en}}</ref>{{see also|Mathura art}}

===Ancient history===
Archaeological excavations at Mathura show the gradual growth of a village into an important city during the [[Vedic age]]. The earliest period belonged to the [[Painted Grey Ware culture]] (1100–500 BCE), followed by the [[Northern Black Polished Ware]] culture (700–200 BCE). Mathura derived its importance as a center of trade due to its location where the [[Grand Trunk Road|northern trade route]] of the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] met with the routes to [[Malwa]] (central India) and the [[Western India|west coast]].<ref name="Singh2008">{{cite book|author=Upinder Singh|title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&pg=PA281|year=2008|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=978-81-317-1120-0|pages=281, 336}}</ref> Archaeologists have discovered a fragment of Mathura red sandstone from [[Rakhigarhi]] - a site of [[Indus Valley civilisation]] dated to third millennium BCE - which was used as a grindstone; red sandstone was also a popular material for [[Art of Mathura|historic period sculptures]].<ref>{{Cite journal |journal=Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies in Archaeology |last1=S.gautam|first1=Mantabya|last2=Law|first2=Randall|last3=Garge|first3=Tejas|title=Initial Geologic Provenience Studies of Stone and Metal Artefacts from Rakhigarhi|url=https://www.academia.edu/10827842|language=en}}</ref>

By the sixth century BCE Mathura became the capital of the [[Surasena|Surasena Kingdom]].<ref name=ImpGazetteer /> The city was later ruled by the [[Maurya]] empire (fourth to second centuries BCE). [[Megasthenes]], writing in the early third century BCE, mentions Mathura as a great city under the name Μέθορα (''Méthora'').<ref>Megasthenes, fragment 23 "The Surasenians, an Indian tribe, with two great cities, Methora and Clisobora; the navigable river [[Iomanes]] flows through their territory" quoted in [[Arrian]] Indica 8.5. Also "The river Jomanes ([[Yamuna]]) flows through the Palibothri into the Ganges between the towns Methora and Carisobora." in [http://www.mssu.edu/projectsouthasia/history/primarydocs/Foreign_Views/GreekRoman/Megasthenes-Indika.htm FRAGM.

The [[Indo-Greeks]] may have taken control, direct or indirect, of Mathura some time between 180 BCE and 100 BCE, and remained so as late as 70 BCE according to the [[Yavanarajya inscription]],<ref name="Rhie">History of Early Stone Sculpture at Mathura: Ca. 150 BCE – 100 CE, Sonya Rhie Quintanilla, BRILL, 2007, p.8-10 [https://books.google.com/books?id=X7Cb8IkZVSMC&pg=PA8]</ref> which was found in [[Maghera]], a town {{convert|17|km}} from Mathura.<ref name=BotAI /> The opening of the 3 line text of this inscription in [[Brahmi script]] translates as: "In the 116th year of the [[Yavana]] kingdom..."<ref>{{cite book|title=Kushāṇa studies: new perspectives|author=B.

====Indo-Scythians====
After a period of local rule, Mathura was conquered by the [[Indo-Scythians]] during the first century BCE. The Indo-Scythian satraps of Mathura are sometimes called the "[[Northern Satraps]]", as opposed to the "[[Western Satraps]]" ruling in [[Gujarat]] and [[Malwa]]. However, Indo-Scythian control proved to be short lived, following the reign of the Indo-Scythian ''Mahakshatrapa'' ("Great Satrap") [[Rajuvula]], {{Circa|10}}–25 CE. The Mora Well inscription of Mahakshatrapa [[Rajuvula]], of the early decades of the first century CE, found in a village seven miles from Mathura, stated that images ''pratima(h)'' of the blessed (''bhagavatam'') five [[Vrishni heroes]], were installed in a stone shrine of a person called Tosa.<ref name="auto2">{{cite book |author=Meenakshi Jain |date=2019 |title=Flight of Deities and Rebirth of Temples: Episodes from Indian History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lAQNxQEACAAJ |publisher=Aryan Books International |page=64 |isbn=978-8173056192}}</ref> The heroes were identified from a passage in the [[Vayu Purana]] as Samkarsana, [[Vasudeva|Vasudev]], Pradyumna, Samba, and Aniruddha.<ref>{{cite book |author=Jitendra Nath Banerjea |date=1968 |title=Religion in Art and Archaeology: Vaishnavism and Saivism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVKGvgAACAAJ |publisher=University of Lucknow |pages=12–13}}</ref> The English translation of the inscription read:-

The Mathura inscription of the time of Mahakshatrapa [[Rajuvula]]'s son, Mahakshatrapa [[Sodasa]] recorded erection of a ''torana'' (gateway), ''vedika'' (terrace) and ''chatuhsala'' (quadrangle) at the ''Mahasthana'' (great place) of Bhagavat Vasudeva.<ref>{{cite book |author=Harihar Panda |date=2007 |title=Prof. H.C.

====Kushan Empire====
During the rule of the great [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]]as, art and culture flourished in the region and reached new heights and is now famously known as the [[Art of Mathura|Mathura School of Art]]. The Kushans took control of Mathura some time after Mahakshatrapa [[Sodasa]], although several of his successors ruled as Kushans vassals, such as the Indo-Scythian "Great Satrap" [[Kharapallana]] and the "Satrap" [[Vanaspara]], both of whom paid allegiance to the Kushans in an inscription at [[Sarnath]], dating to the third year of the reign of the Kushan emperor [[Kanishka|Kanishka the Great]] {{Circa|130}} CE.<ref>''A Catalogue of the Indian Coins in the British Museum.

Chinese Buddhist Monk [[Faxian]] mentions the city as a centre of Buddhism about 400 CE. He found the people were very well off, there were no taxes other than for those on farmers who tilled the royal land. He found that people did not kill animals, no one consumed wine, and did not eat onion or garlic.  He found that engraved title deeds were issued to land owners. Visiting priests were provided with accommodation, beds, mats, food, drinks and clothes to perform scholarly works.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beal|first=Samuel|title=Si-Yu-Ki: Buddhist Records of the Western World (translated from chinese)|publisher=Truebner & Co|year=1884|location=London}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=March 2020}}

====High Middle Ages====
The city was sacked and many of its temples destroyed by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] in 1018 CE.<ref name=EB1911/> The capture of Mathura by [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Maḥmūd Ibn Sebüktegīn]] is described by the historian al-Utbi (Abu Nasr Muhammad ibn Muhammad al Jabbaru-l 'Utbi) in his work [[Tarikh Yamini]] as follows:

{{Blockquote|The wall of the city was constructed of hard stone, and two gates opened upon the river flowing under the city, which were erected upon strong and lofty foundations, to protect them against the floods of the river and rains. On both sides of the city there were a thousand houses, to which idol temples were attached, all strengthened from top to bottom by rivets of iron, and all made of masonry work; and opposite to them were other buildings, supported on broad wooden pillars, to give them strength.}}

{{Blockquote|In the middle of the city there was a temple larger and firmer than the rest, which can neither be described nor painted. The Sultan thus wrote respecting it :— " If any should wish to construct a building equal to this, he would not be able to do it without expending an hundred thousand thousand red dinars, and it would occupy two hundred years, even though the most experienced and able workmen were employed." Among the idols there were five made of red gold, each five yards high, fixed in the air without support. In the eyes of one of these idols there were two rubies, of such value, that if any one were to sell such as are like them, he would obtain fifty thousand dinars. On another, there was a sapphire purer than water, and more sparkling than crystal; the weight was four hundred and fifty miskals. The two feet of another idol weighed four thousand four hundred miskals, and the entire quantity of gold yielded by the bodies of these idols, was ninety-eight thousand three hundred miskals. The idols of silver amounted to two hundred, but they could not be weighed without breaking them to pieces and putting them into scales. The Sultan gave orders that all the temples should be burnt with naphtha and fire, and levelled with the ground.<ref>{{cite book |author= Sir Henry Miers Elliot & John Dowson |date= 1867|title=The History of India, as told by its own Historians Volume 2 |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofindiaas02elli/page/n61/mode/2up |pages=44–45}}</ref>}}

The temple at Katra was sacked by [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Maḥmūd Ibn Sebüktegīn]]. A temple was built to replace it in 1150 CE. The Mathura ''prasasti'' (Eulogistic Inscription) dated [[Vikram Samvat|Samvat (V.S.)]] 1207 (1150 CE), said to have been found in 1889 CE at the Keshava mound by [[Alois Anton Führer|Anton Fuhrer]], German Indologist who worked with the Archaeological Survey of India, recorded the foundations of a temple dedicated to [[Vishnu]] at the Katra site:

{{Blockquote|He was so zealous a Musulman that he utterly destroyed divers places of worship of the infidels, and left not a vestige remaining of them.

"The rebellion in Mathurá district seems to have gained ground. 'On the 14th Rajab, 1080, [28 November 1669], his Majesty left Dihlí for Akbarábád, and almost daily enjoyed the pleasures of the chase. On the 21st Rajab, whilst hunting, he received the report of a rebellion having broken out at Mauza' Rewarah, Chandarkah, and Surkhrú. Hasan 'Ali Khán was ordered to attack the rebels at night, which he did, and the firing lasted till 12 o'clock the next day. The rebels, unable longer to withstand, thinking of the honour of their families, now fought with short arms, and many imperial soldiers and companions of Hasan ’Alí were killed. Three hundred rebels were sent to perdition, and two hundred and fifty, men and women, caught. Hasan ’Alí, in the afternoon, reported personally the result of the fight, and was ordered to leave the prisoners and the cattle in charge of Sayyid Zain ul-'Abidin, the jágirdár of the place. Çaf Shikan Khán also (who after ’Abdunnabí's death had been appointed Faujdár of Mathura) waited on the emperor, and was ordered to tell off two hundred troopers to guard the fields attached to the villages, and prevent soldiers from plundering and kidnapping children. Námdár Khán, Faujdár of Murádábád, also came to pay his respects. Çafshikan Khán was removed from his office, and Hasan 'Ali Khán was appointed Faujdár of Mathura, with a command of Three Thousand and Five Hundred, 2000 troopers, and received a dress of honour, a sword, and a horse. * * * On the 18th Sha'bán [1st January, 1670), his Majesty entered Agrah. Kokilá Ját, the wicked ringleader of the rebels of District*......, who had been the cause of ’Abdunnabí's death and who had plundered Parganah Sa'dábád, was at last caught by Hasan ’Alí Khán and his zealous peshkár, Shaikh Razíuddin, and he was now sent with the Shaikh to Agrah, where by order of his Majesty he was executed. Kokila's son and daughter were given to Jawahir Khán Nazir [a eunuch]. The girl was later married to Shah Quli, the well-known Chelah; and his son, who was called Fázil, became in time so excellent a Hafiz [one who knows the Qorán by heart], that his Majesty preferred him to all others and even chaunted passages to him. Shaikh Razíuddin, who had captured Kokila, belonged to a respectable family in Bhagalpur, Bihár, and was an excellent soldier, administrator, and companion; he was at the same time so learned, that he was ordered to assist in the compilation of the Fatáwá i 'Alamgiri [the great code of Muhammadan laws]. He received a daily allowance of three rupees.'+ (Haásir i ’Alamgiri, pp. 92 to 91.)

====Pilgrimage by the Family of Peshwa of Maratha Empire====

During the period of the expansion of [[Maratha Confederacy|Maratha Empire]], pilgrimage to the holy places in the north became quite frequent.

That is how the practice arose of ladies accompanying military expeditions. The mother of [[Peshwa]] [[Balaji Baji Rao]], [[Kashibai|Kashitai]] performed her famous pilgrimage for four years in the north, visiting Mathura, [[Prayagraj|Prayag]], [[Ayodhya]], [[Varanasi|Banaras]], and other holy places.<ref>{{cite book |author=Govind Sakharam Sardesai |date=1946 |title=New History of the Marathas, Vol. 2 |url=https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.1545/page/n265/mode/2up |publisher=Phoenix Publication |page=243}}</ref>
