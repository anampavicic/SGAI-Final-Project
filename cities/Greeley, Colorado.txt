===Union Colony===
{{Main|Union Colony of Colorado}}

Greeley began as the [[Union Colony of Colorado]], which was founded in 1869 by [[Nathan C. Meeker]], an agricultural reporter for the ''[[New York Tribune]]'', as an experimental utopian farming community "based on temperance, religion, agriculture, education and family values," with the backing of the ''Tribune''{{'}}s editor [[Horace Greeley]], who had visited Colorado in the 1859 [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush]] and had popularized the phrase "[[Go West, young man]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greeleyhistory.org/index.html |title=Greeley, Colorado History for Kids |publisher=Greeleyhistory.org |date=July 21, 2013 |access-date=September 13, 2013}}</ref><ref name=rivers>[[Donald Worster|Worster, Donald]] (1985) ''Rivers of Empire: Water, Aridity, and the Growth of the American West''.

By May, 500 people had arrived to take up residence in the new colony.

===Latham===
Greeley is located just west of the area previously occupied by the [[Overland Trail]] station of Latham, originally called the Cherokee City Station. The Latham station, which was also known as Fort Latham, was built in 1862 and named in honor of [[Milton Latham|Milton S. Latham]], one of California's early senators. The stagecoach station was at the confluence of the [[South Platte River]] and the [[Cache la Poudre River]]. It is believed that the birth of the [[first white child]] born in Colorado, a girl, occurred there.{{cn|date=October 2024}} Fort Latham was the headquarters of the government troops during the Indian conflicts of 1860–1864 and the county seat; the post office was called Latham.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.courts.state.co.us/Courts/District/Custom.cfm?District_ID=19&Page_ID=319|title=Colorado Judicial Branch|publisher=courts.state.co.us}}</ref>{{bsn|date=October 2024}}

In June of 2012, Greeley became the first city in the state of Colorado to implement SB11-273, known as the ''Law of Common Consumption'',<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hamling |first1=Alison |title=DDA Dr. of Experience |url=https://leg.colorado.gov/agencies/office-legislative-legal-services/session-laws-2011 |website=Colorado General Assembly |access-date=January 9, 2020}}</ref> allowing for patrons of the Downtown Greeley Entertainment District to buy drinks in "Go-Cups" from participating downtown establishments.

On 28 May 2024, a severe hailstorm impacted the eastern side of the city, covering some areas in over one foot of hail (~30.5 cm) and causing one fatality.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Thomas |first=Dillon |date=2024-06-01 |title=Fatal hailstorm in Greeley results in disaster declaration - CBS Colorado |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/fatal-hailstorm-greeley-results-disaster-declaration/ |access-date=2024-06-01 |website=www.cbsnews.com |language=en-US}}</ref> Mayor John Gates signed a local disaster declaration due to major flooding and hail.

==Geography==
Greeley is located in the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] of northern Colorado about {{convert|25|mi|abbr=on}} east of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and north of [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]].

Greeley is bordered on the south by the towns of [[Evans, Colorado|Evans]] and [[Garden City, Colorado|Garden City]]. The Greeley/Evans area is bounded on the south by the [[South Platte River]], and the [[Cache la Poudre River]] flows through north Greeley. The city is served by [[U.S. Highway 85 (Colorado)|US Route 85]] and [[U.S. Highway 34 (Colorado)|US Route 34]].<ref>''Colorado Atlas & Gazetteer,'' DeLorme, 12th ed. 2015, p. 31 {{ISBN|0899332889}}</ref>

At the [[2020 United States Census]], the city had a total area of {{convert|127.148|km2|acre|order=flip}} including {{convert|0.413|km2|acre|order=flip}} of water.<ref name=2020_Census/>

The nearest city with a population of over 100,000 is [[Fort Collins, CO|Fort Collins]], in neighboring [[Larimer County, CO|Larimer County]].

===Climate===
[[File:Greeley, CO, September 19, 2013 (12441526333).jpg|thumb|Flooding in Greeley in 2013]]
Greeley experiences a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSk''). High temperatures are generally around 90–95&nbsp;°F (32&nbsp;°C) in the summer and 40-45&nbsp;°F (4&nbsp;°C) in the winter, although significant variation occurs. The hottest days generally occur around the third week of July and the coldest in January. Nighttime lows are near 60&nbsp;°F (16&nbsp;°C) in the summer and around 15–20&nbsp;°F (−9&nbsp;°C) in the winter. Record high temperatures of 112&nbsp;°F (44.4&nbsp;°C) have been recorded, as have record low temperatures of –25&nbsp;°F (–32&nbsp;°C). The first freeze typically occurs around October 4 and the last around May 4. [[Extratropical cyclone]]s which disrupt the weather for the eastern two-thirds of the US often originate in or near Colorado, which means Greeley does not experience many fully developed storm systems. Warm fronts, sleet, and freezing rain are practically nonexistent here. In addition, the city's proximity to the [[Rocky Mountains]] and lower elevation, compared to the mountains west of the city, result in less precipitation and fewer [[thunderstorm]]s. This is paradoxical, because adjacent areas (mostly farmland) experience between 7 and 9 [[hail]] days per year.<ref>[http://www.ucar.edu/communications/factsheets/Hail.html UCAR: Hail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015141754/http://www.ucar.edu/communications/factsheets/Hail.html |date=October 15, 2009 }}.</ref>

The climate in Greeley, as well as all of Colorado, is extremely dry. The [[Chinook wind]]s coming off the mountains often raise temperatures to near 70&nbsp;°F (21&nbsp;°C) in January and February, and sometimes to near 90&nbsp;°F (32&nbsp;°C) in April. Greeley's elevation and low year-round humidity means that nighttime low temperatures are practically never above 68&nbsp;°F (20&nbsp;°C), even in the hottest part of the summer. The diurnal temperature range is usually rather wide, with a 50-degree (Fahrenheit) difference between daytime highs and nighttime lows not uncommon, especially in the spring and fall. Rapid day-to-day and [[diurnal temperature variation|diurnal]] fluctuation in temperature is also common.
