'''Kota Kinabalu''' ({{IPA|zsm|ˈkota kinaˈbalu|lang}}; formerly known as '''Jesselton'''), colloquially referred to as '''KK''', is the state capital of [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]]. It is also the capital of the [[Kota Kinabalu District]] as well as the [[West Coast Division]] of Sabah. The city is located on the northwest coast of [[Borneo]] facing the [[South China Sea]]. The [[Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park]]<ref name=bk1/> lies to its west and [[Mount Kinabalu]], which gave the city its name, is located to its east. Kota Kinabalu has a population of 452,058 according to the 2010 census;<ref name="st1">{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/population/03ringkasan_kawasan_PBT_Jadual1.pdf|title=Population Distribution by Local Authority Areas and Mukims, 2010 (page 1 & 8)|publisher=Department of Statistics, Malaysia|access-date=10 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205090002/http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/population/03ringkasan_kawasan_PBT_Jadual1.pdf|archive-date=5 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> when the adjacent [[Penampang District|Penampang]] and [[Tuaran District|Tuaran]] districts are included, the metro area has a combined population of 628,725.<ref name=st1/> The 2020 Census revealed an increase in the municipal population to 500,421, while the wider area including the Penampang and Putatan districts had a population of 731,406.<ref>Dept. of Statistics Malaysia (web).</ref>

In the 15th century, the area of Kota Kinabalu was under the influence of [[Bruneian Empire]]. Historically, the Kadazandusuns called the area by the name of Dondoung.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://incubator.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wp/dtp/Sabah|title=Kadazandusun Wikimedia Incubator Article (in Kadazandusun)|access-date=11 January 2024}}</ref> In the 19th century, the [[British North Borneo Company]] (BNBC) first set up a settlement near the [[Gaya Island]]. However, it was destroyed by fire in 1897 by a local leader named [[Mat Salleh Rebellion|Mat Salleh]]. In July 1899, the place located opposite to the Gaya Island was identified as a suitable place for settlements. Development in the area was started soon after that; and the place was named "Api-api" before it was renamed after [[Sir Charles Jessel]], the vice-chairman of BNBC, as "Jesselton". Jesselton became a major trading port in the area, and was connected to the [[Sabah State Railway|North Borneo Railway]]. Jesselton was largely destroyed during [[World War II]]. The Japanese occupation of Jesselton provoked several local uprisings notably the [[Jesselton Revolt]] but they were eventually defeated by the Japanese. After the war, BNBC was unable to finance the high cost of reconstructions and the place was ceded to the [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|British Crown Colony]]. The British Crown declared Jesselton as the new capital of [[North Borneo]] in 1946 and started to rebuild the town. After the formation of Malaysia, North Borneo was renamed as Sabah. In 1967, Jesselton was renamed as Kota Kinabalu, Kota being the Malay word for City and Kinabalu after the nearby [[Mount Kinabalu]]. Kota Kinabalu was granted city status in 2000.

Kota Kinabalu is often known as '''KK''' both in [[Malaysia]] and internationally. It is a major tourist destination and a gateway for travellers visiting Sabah and Borneo.<ref name="kk1">{{cite news|url=http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2010&dt=0225&pub=Utusan_Malaysia&sec=Sabah_%26_Sarawak&pg=wb_01.htm |title=Dari Jesselton ke Kota Kinabalu |trans-title=From Jesselton to Kota Kinabalu |author=Junaidi Ladjana |language=ms |newspaper=[[Utusan Malaysia]] |date=25 February 2010 |access-date=19 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055157/http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2010&dt=0225&pub=Utusan_Malaysia&sec=Sabah_%26_Sarawak&pg=wb_01.htm |archive-date=21 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="tourism">{{cite news|url=http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/6/11/business/17978745&sec=business |title=Tourism hub set to lift Sabah real estate |work=The Star |date=11 June 2007 |access-date=15 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030103229/http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/6/11/business/17978745&sec=business |archive-date=30 October 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Kinabalu Park]] is located about 90&nbsp;kilometres from the city and there are many other tourist attractions in and around the city.

==Etymology==
[[File:Kina Balu from Pinokok Valley.png|left|thumb|200px|"Kina Balu from Pinokok Valley" – lithograph published in 1862.]]
Kota Kinabalu is named after [[Mount Kinabalu]], which is situated about 50&nbsp;kilometres east-northeast of the city. ''Kinabalu'' is derived from the name ''Aki Nabalu'' meaning the "revered place of the dead." ''Aki'' means "ancestors" or "grandfather", and ''Nabalu'' is a name for the mountain in the [[Dusun language]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Tamara Thiessen|title=Borneo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g9sj_FMSMu8C&pg=PA155|year=2008|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-252-1|pages=155–}}</ref> There is also a source claiming that the term originated from ''Ki Nabalu'', ''Ki'' meaning "have" or "exist", and ''Nabalu'' meaning "spirit of the dead".<ref name="multiple">{{cite web|author=Sorudim, Lesaya|url=http://www.kdca.org.my/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=101&Itemid=112|title=KINABALU: Kina Balu, Aki Nabalu, or Ki Nabalu?|publisher=KDCA Publications|date=2 May 2005|access-date=15 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928104158/http://www.kdca.org.my/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=101&Itemid=112|archive-date=28 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The word ''kota'' comes from [[Malay language|Malay]] word ''kota'' which in turn comes from the [[Sanskrit]] word कोट्ट (kota) which means fort, fortress, castle, fortified house, fortification, works, city, town, or place encircled by walls.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Southeast Asia over Three Generations: Essays Presented to Benedict R. O'G. Anderson|last=Siegel|first=James T.|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2018|isbn=9781501718946|location=New York|pages=94}}</ref> It is also used formally in a few other Malaysian towns and cities, for example, [[Kota Bharu]], [[Kota Tinggi]], and [[Kota Kemuning]]. It can also be used informally to refer to any towns or cities. Hence, a direct translation of the name ''Kota Kinabalu'' into English would be "City of Kinabalu" or "Kinabalu City".

===Original names===

Besides Jesselton, there are also other older names for Kota Kinabalu. The most popular is ''Api-Api'', or simply ''Api'', which is a Malay word meaning 'Fire'.<ref name=bk1/> [[Wendy Law Suart]] wrote in her book on [[North Borneo]], ''The Lingering Eye'', "there is in the [[Sabah Museum|Sabah State Museum]] a Dutch map of Borneo and the [[Celebes Islands|Celebes]] dated 1657 in which the settlement where Jesselton was to stand is clearly labelled Api Api. It may have some connection with the seaside tree with breathing roots that bears the same name".<ref>Wendy Law Suart (1993) ''The Lingering Eye'' page 55, footnote</ref> There are claims, however, that Kota Kinabalu was actually named after a nearby river called ''Sungai Api-Api''.  In Chinese, the city is still known as 'Api', which is the [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] pronunciation for 亚庇 ([[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified Chinese]]; [[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional Chinese]]: 亞庇; [[Pinyin]]: ''yà bì'').

Another suggested historical name is ''Deasoka'', which roughly means "below the coconut tree" in the Bajau language.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dbkk.sabah.gov.my/bm/content/static/view/339 |title=NAMA ASAL |language=ms |publisher=DBKK Official Website |access-date=19 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708135211/http://www.dbkk.sabah.gov.my/bm/content/static/view/339 |archive-date=8 July 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The Bajau locals purportedly used this name to refer to a village in the southern part of the city which was filled with coconut trees. Yet another name was ''Singgah Mata'' which literally means "transit eye", but can be loosely translated as "pleasing to the eye". It is a name said to have been given by fishermen from Gaya Island referring to the strip of land that is today's downtown Kota Kinabalu.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sawatan, Jackson|url=http://www.mykmu.net/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=2698|title=Adakah Gaya Sekadar 'Singgah mata' Untuk Pembangkang?|publisher=BERNAMA|access-date=8 March 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929043515/http://www.mykmu.net/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=2698|archive-date=29 September 2007}}</ref> Today, all these names have been immortalised as names of streets or buildings around the city. Some examples are Lintasan Deasoka, Api-Api Centre and Singgah Mata Street.

Being the capital city of Sabah, Kota Kinabalu plays an important role in the political and economic welfare of the population of the entire state. It is the seat of the state government where almost all of their [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]] and [[Government agency|agencies]] are based. Most of the [[Politics of Malaysia|Malaysian federal government]] agencies and departments are also located in Kota Kinabalu. The Sabah State Legislative Assembly is located at the nearby Likas Bay. There are four members of parliament (MPs) representing the four [[List of Malaysian electoral districts|parliamentary constituencies]] in the city: Sepanggar (''P.171''), Kota Kinabalu (''P.172''), Putatan (''P.173''), Tuaran ("P.176") and Penampang (''P.174''). The city also elects 9 representatives to the state legislature from the state assembly districts of Karambunai, Inanam, Likas, Api-Api, Luyang, Tanjung Aru, Petagas, Kepayan, Segama, Menggatal, Tuaran, Lido, and Moyog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pmr.penerangan.gov.my/index.php/politik/1637-senarai-bahagian-bahagian-pilihan-raya-parlimen-dan-dun-setiap-negeri-negeri.html|title=List of Parliamentary Elections Parts and State Legislative Assemblies on Every States|publisher=Ministry of Information Malaysia|access-date=19 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518200007/http://pmr.penerangan.gov.my/index.php/politik/1637-senarai-bahagian-bahagian-pilihan-raya-parlimen-dan-dun-setiap-negeri-negeri.html|archive-date=18 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The city is defined within the borders of what is the [[Districts of Malaysia|district]], formerly the municipality, of Kota Kinabalu. With an area of 351 square kilometres, it is the smallest but the most populous district in Sabah.<ref name="statbulletin"/> It encompasses [[Tanjung Aru]] and [[Kepayan]] in the south, up to [[Telipok]] and [[Sepanggar]] in the north.

On one end of the scale, Kota Kinabalu may sometimes only refer to, especially by local inhabitants, the city centre or central business district near the sea facing Gaya Island. On the other end of the scale, it may also refer to the [[metropolitan area]] which includes urban Kota Kinabalu (Greater Kota Kinabalu), and the surrounding towns of [[Papar, Sabah|Papar]] and [[Kinarut]] in the south, and [[Tuaran]] and [[Tamparuli]] in the north, being within its zone of influence.

Kota Kinabalu is located on the west coast of Sabah. The city lies on a narrow flatland between the [[Crocker Range]] to the east and the [[South China Sea]] to the west. There are six islands off the coast of the city. The largest is [[Gaya Island]], the site of the first British settlement. Approximately 8,000 people live there.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/8/5/nation/15060803&sec=nation |title=Cops storm Pulau Gaya, clash leaves one dead, four injured |work=The Star |date=5 August 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030103237/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/8/5/nation/15060803&sec=nation |archive-date=30 October 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The smaller islands, mainly uninhabited, are named Sapi Island, [[Manukan Island]], Sulug Island, Mamutik Island and Sepanggar Island to the north.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=kota+Kinabalu&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=38.554089,67.851563&ie=UTF8&ll=5.997167,116.06884&spn=0.189501,0.265045&z=12|title=Google Maps}}</ref> Sepanggar island is located north of the National Park opposite [[Sepanggar Bay]].

Flat land is at a premium in the city centre, and there is a strict limit to the height of buildings: the airport is {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=on}} away, and the city is directly in the flight path.

There is a small population of [[Indian Malaysian|Indians]], [[Pakistanis in Malaysia|Pakistanis]] and Eurasians scattered around the city. More recently, the number of expatriates living in the city, whether temporarily or permanently, have also increased. Most of them come from China, South Korea, Japan, Australia, Taiwan and Europe.

Among the Chinese, the most commonly spoken [[varieties of Chinese|varieties]] are [[Huizhou|Huiyang]] [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] (Simplified Chinese: 惠阳客家话; Traditional Chinese: 惠陽客家話) and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. Additionally, most Chinese can speak [[Cantonese]], although with widely varying levels of fluency. Almost all residents are also able to speak English, especially the younger generation. However, some find it difficult to speak fluently due to a limited vocabulary and the general lack of usage of the English language as a conversational lingua franca among Sabahans as a whole.

The number of [[Coastal Kadazan language|Kadazan-Dusun]] speakers is thought to have dropped significantly throughout Sabah, especially in larger towns or cities like Kota Kinabalu. However, some effort has been taken by some to revive the usage of the language. Kadazan has been considered an [[endangered language]], along with the culture of ethnic Kadazans.<ref>{{cite web|author=Reid, Anthony|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&se=gglsc&d=5000484947&er=deny|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130201065105/http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&se=gglsc&d=5000484947&er=deny|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 February 2013|title=Endangered Identity: Kadazan or Dusun in Sabah|publisher=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies, Vol. 28|year=1997|access-date=15 January 2008}}</ref>
