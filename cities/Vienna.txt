Vienna is the [[Culture of Austria|cultural]], [[Economy of Austria|economic]], and [[Politics of Austria|political]] center of the country, the [[List of cities in the European Union by population within city limits|fifth-largest city by population]] in the [[European Union]], and the most-populous of the [[List of cities and towns on Danube river|cities on the Danube river]].

The city lies on the eastern edge of the [[Vienna Woods]] (''Wienerwald''), the northeasternmost foothills of the [[Alps]], that separate Vienna from the more western parts of Austria, at the transition to the [[Pannonian Basin]]. It sits on the [[Danube]], and is traversed by the highly regulated [[Wienfluss]] (''Vienna River''). Vienna is completely surrounded by [[Lower Austria]], and lies around 50&nbsp;km (31&nbsp;mi) west of [[Slovakia]] and its capital [[Bratislava]], 60&nbsp;km (37&nbsp;mi) northwest of [[Hungary]], and 60&nbsp;km (37&nbsp;mi) south of [[Moravia]] ([[Czech Republic]]).

The once [[Celts|Celtic]] settlement of ''Vedunia'' was converted by the [[Roman people|Romans]] into the [[castrum]] and [[canaba]] ''[[Vindobona]]'' (province of [[Pannonia]]) in the 1st century, and was elevated to a [[municipium]] with Roman city rights in 212. This was followed by a time in the sphere of influence of the [[Lombards]] and later the [[Pannonian Avars]], when [[Slavs]] formed the majority of the region's population.{{efn|some Viennese boroughs have Slavic-derived names: [[Döbling]], [[Hietzing|Lainz]], [[Liesing]], [[Währing]]}} From the 8th century on, the region was settled by the [[Baiuvarii]]. In 1155, Vienna was established as the seat of the [[Babenberg]]s, the lords of Austria from 976 to 1278, and, in 1221, Vienna was granted city rights. In the 16th century, the subsequent lords of Austria, the [[Habsburg]]s, established Vienna as the seat of the emperors of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], with a short exception, until its dissolution in 1806. With the formation of the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1804, Vienna became the capital of it and all its successor states.

Throughout the [[modern era]] Vienna has been among the largest German-speaking cities in the world, being the largest in the 18th and 19th century, peaking at two million inhabitants before it was overtaken by [[Berlin]] at the beginning of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/12/29/98276500.pdf |title=Vienna after the war |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215021436/https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/12/29/98276500.pdf |archive-date=15 February 2020 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=29 December 1918 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ots.at/touch/presseaussendung/OTS_20130720_OTS0012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130720222437/http://www.ots.at/touch/presseaussendung/OTS_20130720_OTS0012 |title=Wien nun zweitgrößte deutschsprachige Stadt |website=touch.ots.at |access-date=21 July 2013 |archive-date=20 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://ergebnisse.zensus2011.de/ |title=Ergebnisse Zensus 2011 |publisher=Statistische Ämter des Bundes und der Länder |date=31 May 2013 |access-date=31 May 2013 |language=de |archive-date=5 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605031517/https://ergebnisse.zensus2011.de/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Vienna is host to many major [[international organization]]s, including the United Nations, [[OPEC]] and the [[OSCE]].

== Etymology==
{{See also|Names of European cities in different languages: U–Z#V|Vindobona}}
The place is mentioned as ''Οϋι[νδ]όβονα (Oui[nd]obona)'' in the 2nd century AD (Ptolemy, ''Geography'', II, 14, 3); ''Vindobona'' in the 3rd century (''Itinerarium Antonini Augusti'' 233, 8); ''Vindobona'' in the 4th century ({{lang|la|[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]}}, V, 1); ''Vindomana'' ab. 400 ({{lang|la|[[Notitia Dignitatum]]}}, 145, 16); ''Vindomina, Vendomina'' in the 6th century ([[Jordanes]], ''[[De origine actibusque Getarum]]'', 50, 264).

The English name ''Vienna'' is borrowed from the homonymous Italian name. The German name {{lang|de|Wien}} comes from the name of the river ''Wien'', mentioned ''ad UUeniam'' in 881 (''Wenia-'' in modern writing).<ref>{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Csendes |contribution=Das Werden Wiens – Die siedlungsgeschichtlichen Grundlagen |language=de |editor1-last=Csendes |editor1-first=Peter |editor2-first=F. |editor2-last=Oppl |title=Wien&nbsp;– Geschichte einer Stadt von den Anfängen zur Ersten Türkenbelagerung |publisher=Böhlau |location=Vienna |year=2001 |pages=55–94, here p. 57 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Pleyel |title=Das römische Österreich |publisher=Pichler |location=Vienna |year=2002 |isbn=3-85431-270-9 |page=83 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor-first1=Martin |editor-last1=Mosser |editor-first2=Karin |editor-last2=Fischer-Ausserer |title=Judenplatz.

=== Roman period===
{{Main|Vindobona}}
In the 1st century, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] set up the [[Castra|military camp]] of [[Vindobona]] in [[Pannonia]] on the site of today's Vienna city center near the Danube with an adjoining civilian town to secure the [[borders of the Roman Empire]]. Construction of the legionary camp began around 97 AD. At its peak, Vindobona had a population of around 15,000 people. It was a part of a trade and communications network across the Empire. Roman emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] may have died here in 180 AD during a campaign against the [[Marcomanni]].

After a Germanic invasion in the second century the city was rebuilt. It served as a seat of the Roman government until the fifth century, when the population fled due to the [[Huns]] invasion of Pannonia. The city was abandoned for several centuries.

Evidence of the Romans in the city is plentiful. Remains of the military camp have been found under the city, as well as fragments of the [[List of Roman canals|canal system]] and figurines.

=== Middle Ages ===
Close ties with other Celtic peoples continued through the ages. The Irish monk [[Coloman of Stockerau|Saint Colman]] (or Koloman, Irish ''Colmán'', derived from ''colm'' "dove") is buried in Melk Abbey and [[Saint Fergil]] (Virgil the Geometer) served as Bishop of Salzburg for forty years. Irish Benedictines founded twelfth-century monastic settlements; evidence of these ties persists in the form of Vienna's great [[Schottenstift]] monastery (Scots Abbey), once home to many Irish monks.
In 976, [[Leopold I, Margrave of Austria|Leopold I of Babenberg]] became count of the [[Bavarian Ostmark|Eastern March]], a district centered on the Danube on the eastern frontier of [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. This initial district grew into the [[List of rulers of Austria|duchy of Austria]]. Each succeeding Babenberg ruler expanded the march east along the Danube, eventually encompassing Vienna and the lands immediately east. In 1155, [[Henry II, Duke of Austria]] moved the Babenberg family residence with the founding of the [[Schottenstift]] from [[Klosterneuburg]] in Lower Austria to Vienna.<ref name="y233">{{cite book |last1=Loinig |first1=Elisabeth |last2=Eminger |first2=Stefan |last3=Weigl |first3=Andreas |title=Wien und Niederösterreich - eine untrennbare Beziehung? |publisher=Verlag NÖ Institut für Landeskunde |publication-place=St. Pölten |date=2017 |isbn=978-3-903127-07-4 |language=de |page= }}</ref> From that time, Vienna remained the center of the Babenberg dynasty.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lingelbach |first=William E. |title=The History of Nations: Austria-Hungary |publisher=P.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, Christian forces twice stopped [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] armies outside Vienna, in the 1529 [[Siege of Vienna (1529)|siege of Vienna]] and the 1683 [[Battle of Vienna]]. The [[Great Plague of Vienna]] ravaged the city in 1679, killing nearly a third of its population.<ref>{{cite book |last=Spielman |first=John Philip |title=The city & the crown: Vienna and the imperial court, 1600–1740 |publisher=Purdue University Press |location=West Lafayette, Indiana |year=1993 |isbn=1-55753-021-1 |page=141 }}</ref>

=== Austrian Empire and early 20th century===
{{Further|Austrian Empire}}
In 1804, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Vienna became the capital of the newly formed [[Austrian Empire]]. The city continued to play a major role in European and world politics, including hosting the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1814–15. The city also saw major uprisings against Habsburg rule in [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|1848]], which were suppressed. After the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], Vienna remained the capital of what became the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. The city functioned as a center of classical music, for which the title of the [[First Viennese School]] (Haydn/Mozart/Beethoven) is sometimes applied.[[File:Rudolf von Alt-Opera Crossroads in Vienna.jpg|thumb|Vienna's {{lang|de|Ringstraße}} and the State Opera in around 1870|left]]During the latter half of the 19th century, Vienna developed what had previously been the [[bastion]]s and [[glacis]] into the {{lang|de|[[Ringstraße]]}}, a new [[boulevard]] surrounding the historical town and a major prestige project. Former suburbs were incorporated, and the city of Vienna grew dramatically. In 1918, after [[World War I]], Vienna became capital of the [[Republic of German-Austria]], and then in 1919 of the [[First Republic of Austria]].

From the late-19th century to 1938, the city remained a center of high culture and of [[modernism]]. A world capital of music, Vienna played host to composers such as [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Gustav Mahler]], and [[Richard Strauss]].
The city's cultural contributions in the first half of the 20th century included, among many, the [[Vienna Secession]] movement in art, the [[Second Viennese School]], the architecture of [[Adolf Loos]], the philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and the [[Vienna Circle]].
===Red Vienna===
[[Image:Döbling (Wien) - Karl-Marx-Hof.JPG|thumb|[[Karl-Marx-Hof]], a symbol of [[Red Vienna]]]]
{{Main|Red Vienna}}
The city of Vienna became the center of [[socialist]] politics from 1919 to 1934, a period referred to as [[Red Vienna]] (''Das rote Wien''). After a new breed of socialist politicians won the local elections they engaged in a brief but ambitious municipal experiment.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Richard Cockett |title=Vienna: How the City of Ideas Created the Modern World |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2023 |page=71 |isbn=9780300266535 }}</ref> Social democrats had won an absolute majority in the May 1919 municipal election and commanded the city council with 100 of the 165 seats.

Red Vienna is perhaps most well known for its ''[[Gemeindebau|Gemeindebauten]]'', public housing buildings. Between 1925 and 1934, over 60,000 new apartments were built in the Gemeindebauten. Apartments were assigned on the basis of a point system favoring families and less affluent citizens.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Wiener Wohnen - Gemeindewohnungen |url=https://www.wienerwohnen.at/wiener-gemeindebau/geschichte.html |access-date=12 September 2024 |website=wiener-wohnen.at |language=de |archive-date=12 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240912115136/https://www.wienerwohnen.at/wiener-gemeindebau/geschichte.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== July Revolt and Civil War ===
[[File:Gerlach justizpalastbrand 2.jpg|left|thumb|The Palace of Justice burning, 1934]]
In [[July Revolt of 1927|July 1927]], after three nationalist far-right paramilitary members were acquitted of the killing of two social democratic ''[[Republikanischer Schutzbund]]'' members, a riot broke out in the city. The protestors, enraged by the decision, set the [[Palace of Justice, Vienna|Palace of Justice]] ablaze. The police attempted to end the revolt with force and killed at least 84 protestors, with 5 policemen also dying.<ref>{{Cite web |title=30 January 1927 - prologue of a fateful day |url=https://www.wien.gv.at/english/history/commemoration/justice-palace.html |access-date=12 September 2024 |website=www.wien.gv.at |language=en |archive-date=18 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240718062420/https://www.wien.gv.at/english/history/commemoration/justice-palace.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1933, right-wing Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] [[Self-elimination of the Austrian Parliament|dissolved the parliament]], essentially letting him run the country as a [[Federal State of Austria|dictatorship]], banned the [[Communist Party of Austria|Communist Party]] and severely limited the influence of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]]. This led to a [[Austrian Civil War|civil war]] between the right-wing government and socialist forces the following year, which started in [[Linz]] and quickly spread to Vienna. Socialist members of the ''[[Republikanischer Schutzbund]]'' barricaded themselves inside the housing estates and exchanged fire with the police and paramilitary groups. The fighting in Vienna ended after the [[Austrian Armed Forces]] shelled the [[Karl Marx-Hof]], a civilian housing estate, and the ''Schutzbund'' surrendered.<ref>{{Cite web |title=February 1934 - Austrians take up Arms |website=www.wien.gv.at |url=https://www.wien.gv.at/english/history/commemoration/february-1934.html |access-date=12 September 2024 |language=en |archive-date=30 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240930055620/https://www.wien.gv.at/english/history/commemoration/february-1934.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Anschluss and World War II===

{{Main|Anschluss}}
On 15 March 1938, three days after German troops had first entered Austria, [[Adolf Hitler]] arrived in Vienna. 200,000 Austrians greeted him at the [[Heldenplatz]], where he held a speech from a balcony in the Neue Burg, in which he announced that Austria would be absorbed into [[Nazi Germany]]. The persecution of [[History of the Jews in Austria|Jews]] started almost immediately, Viennese Jews were harassed and hounded, their homes and businesses plundered. Some were forced to scrub pro-independence slogans off the streets. This culminated in the [[Kristallnacht]], a nationwide [[pogrom]] against the Jews carried out by the [[Schutzstaffel]] and the [[Sturmabteilung]], with support of the [[Hitler Youth]] and German civilians. All [[Synagogue|synagogues]] and prayer houses in the city were destroyed, bar the [[Stadttempel]], due to its proximity to residential buildings.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Erlanger |first1=Steven |title=Vienna Skewered as a Nazi-Era Pillager of Its Jews |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/07/world/vienna-skewered-as-a-nazi-era-pillager-of-its-jews.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=11 May 2017 |date=7 March 2002 |url-status=live |archive-date=2 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220702054818/https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/07/world/vienna-skewered-as-a-nazi-era-pillager-of-its-jews.html }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Expulsion, Deportation to concentration camps and mass murder – History of the Jews in Vienna From racist mania to genocide |url=https://www.wien.gv.at/english/culture/jewishvienna/history/nationalsocialism.html |access-date=11 May 2017 |work=wien.gv.at |quote=The entry of Hitler's army into Austria in March 1938 triggered unprecedented suffering and hardship for Vienna's Jews.

The few [[Austrian resistance|resistors]] in the city were arrested.

[[Adolf Eichmann]] held office in the expropriated Palais Rothschild and organized the expropriation and persecution of the Jews. Of the almost 200,000 Jews in Vienna, around 120,000 were driven to emigrate and around 65,000 were killed. After the end of the war, the Jewish population of Vienna was only about 5,000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.doew.at/erkennen/ausstellung/1938/die-verfolgung-der-oesterreichischen-juden |title=DÖW – Erkennen – Ausstellung – 1938 – Die Verfolgung der österreichischen Juden |website=www.doew.at |access-date=3 February 2021 |archive-date=6 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220706103854/https://www.doew.at/erkennen/ausstellung/1938/die-verfolgung-der-oesterreichischen-juden |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.xn--jdische-gemeinden-22b.de/index.php/gemeinden/u-z/2087-wien-oesterreich |title=Jüdische Gemeinde – Wien (Österreich) |website=www.xn—jdische-gemeinden-22b.de |access-date=3 February 2021 |archive-date=10 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220610035119/https://www.xn--jdische-gemeinden-22b.de/index.php/gemeinden/u-z/2087-wien-oesterreich |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wien.gv.at/english/culture/jewishvienna/ |title=Jewish Vienna |website=www.wien.gv.at |access-date=11 May 2017 |archive-date=19 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220619120020/https://www.wien.gv.at/english/culture/jewishvienna/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.zeit.de/2018/11/nationalsozialismus-oesterreich-anschluss-antisemitismus-adolf-eichmann/komplettansicht |title=Hitlers willige Vasallen |newspaper=Die Zeit |date=12 March 2018 |access-date=3 February 2021 |archive-date=5 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220505105703/https://www.zeit.de/2018/11/nationalsozialismus-oesterreich-anschluss-antisemitismus-adolf-eichmann/komplettansicht |url-status=live |last1=Riedl |first1=Joachim }}</ref>
[[File:Rachel whitereadwien holocaust mahnmal wien judenplatz.jpg|thumb|The [[Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial]].|left]]
In 1942 the city suffered its first [[Bombing of Vienna in World War II|air raid]], carried out by the [[Soviet Air Forces|Soviet air force]]. Only after the [[Allied invasion of Italy|Allies had taken Italy]] did the next raids commence. From 17 March 1944, 51 air raids were carried out in Vienna. Targets of the bombings were primarily the city's [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]]. However, around a third of the city center was destroyed, and culturally important buildings such as the State Opera and the Burgtheater were burned, and the Albertina was heavily damaged. These air raids lasted until March 1945, just before the Soviet troops started the [[Vienna offensive]].

The [[Red Army]], who had previously [[Budapest offensive|marched through Hungary]], first entered Vienna on 6 April. They first attacked the eastern and southern suburbs, before moving on to the western suburbs. By the 8th they had the center of the city surrounded. The following day the Soviets started with the infiltration of the city center. Fighting continued for a few more days until the [[Soviet Navy]]’s [[Danube Flotilla (Soviet Union)|Danube Flotilla]] naval force arrived with reinforcements. The remaining defending soldiers surrendered that same day.

=== Four-power Vienna===
[[File:Wien Besatzungszonen.png|thumb|[[Allied-occupied Austria|Allied-occupied]] zones in Vienna between 1945 and 1955 following [[World War II]]|left]]
{{further|Allied-occupied Austria}}
After the war, Vienna was part of [[Allied-occupied Austria|Soviet-occupied Eastern Austria]] until September 1945. That month, Vienna was divided into sectors by the four powers: the US, the UK, France, and the [[Soviet Union]] and supervised by an [[Allied Commission]]. The four-power occupation of Vienna differed in one key respect from that of Berlin: the central area of the city, known as the first district, constituted an ''international zone'' in which the four powers alternated control on a monthly basis. The city was policed by the four powers on a day-to-day basis, the "four soldiers in a jeep" method, which had one soldier from each power sitting together, was relied upon. The four powers all had separate headquarters, the Soviets in [[Palais Epstein]] next to the Parliament, the French in Hotel Kummer on Mariahilferstraße, the Americans in the [[Oesterreichische Nationalbank|National Bank]], and the British in [[Schönbrunn Palace|Schönnbrunn Palace]]. The division of the city was not comparable to that of [[Berlin Wall|Berlin]]. Although the borders between the sectors were marked, travel between them was freely possible. 

During the 10 years of the four-power occupation, Vienna was a hotbed for international espionage between the [[Western Bloc|Western]] and [[Eastern bloc]]s, who distrusted one another deeply. The city, just like the rest of the country and Western Europe, had an economic upturn due to the Marshall Plan.

The atmosphere of four-power Vienna is the background for [[Graham Greene]]'s screenplay for the film ''[[The Third Man]]'' (1949). The film's [[theme music]] was composed and performed by Viennese musician [[Anton Karas]] using a [[zither]]. Later he adapted the screenplay as a novel and published it. Occupied Vienna is also depicted in the 1991 [[Philip Kerr]] novel, ''[[A German Requiem (novel)|A German Requiem]]''.

=== Austrian State Treaty and subsequent sovereignty ===
[[File:Graben, szemben a Pestisoszlop. Fortepan 58901.jpg|thumb|The [[Graben, Vienna|Graben]] square in 1966]]
{{Main|Austrian State Treaty}}
The four-power control of Vienna lasted until the [[Austrian State Treaty]] was signed in May 1955 and came into force on 27 July 1955. By October, all soldiers had left the country. That year, after years of reconstruction and restoration, the [[Vienna State Opera|State Opera]] and the [[Burgtheater]], both on the {{lang|de|Ringstraße|italic=no}}, reopened to the public. 

In the Autumn of 1956, Vienna accepted many Hungarian [[Refugee|refugees]], who had fled Hungary after an [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|attempted revolution]]. The city experienced another wave of refugees after the [[Prague Spring]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1968, as well as after the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|collapse of Yugoslavia]] in 1991. 

In 1972 the construction of the ''[[Donauinsel]] and'' the excavation of the [[New Danube]] began. In the same decade, [[Chancellor of Austria|Austrian Chancellor]] [[Bruno Kreisky]] inaugurated the [[Vienna International Center|Vienna International Centre]], a new area of the city created to host international institutions. Vienna has regained much of its former international stature by hosting international organisations, such as the United Nations.

Elevation ranges from {{cvt|151|to|542|m|ft|0}}. The city has a total area of 414.65 square kilometers (160.1 sq mi), making it the largest city in Austria by area.

=== Climate ===
Vienna has a borderline [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb'') and [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfb''), with some parts of the urban core being warm enough for a [[humid subtropical]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa'') classification.

The city has warm, showery summers, with average high temperatures ranging between {{cvt|25|to|27|C|F}} and a record maximum exceeding {{cvt|38|°C|0}}.

Vienna is composed of 23 districts (''Bezirke''). Administrative district offices in Vienna, called Magistratische Bezirksämter, serve functions similar to those in the other Austrian states (called Bezirkshauptmannschaften), the officers being subject to the mayor of Vienna; with the notable exception of the police, which is under federal supervision.

District residents in Vienna (Austrians as well as EU citizens with permanent residence here) elect a District Assembly (Bezirksvertretung). City hall has delegated maintenance budgets, e.g., for schools and parks, so that the districts are able to set priorities autonomously. Any decision of a district can be overridden by the city assembly (Gemeinderat) or the responsible city councilor (amtsführender Stadtrat).

[[File:Wien 01 Burgring b.jpg|thumb|The Ringstraße with the Natural History Museum to the left.]]
The heart and historical city of Vienna, a large part of today's [[Innere Stadt]], was a fortress surrounded by fields to defend itself from potential attackers. In 1850, Vienna with the consent of the emperor annexed 34 surrounding villages,<ref>[[Felix Czeike]]: ''Historisches Lexikon Wien'', volume 5, Kremayr & Scheriau, Vienna 1997, {{ISBN|3-218-00547-7}}, p. 289</ref> called Vorstädte, into the city limits (districts no. 2 to 8, after 1861 with the separation of Margareten from Wieden no. 2 to 9). Consequently, the walls were razed after 1857,<ref>Decision of Emperor Franz Joseph I, published in the official newspaper ''Wiener Zeitung'' on 25 December 1857, p. 1</ref> making it possible for the city center to expand.

In their place, a broad boulevard called the {{lang|de|[[Vienna Ring Road|Ringstraße]]|italic=no}} was built, along which imposing public and private buildings, monuments, and parks were created by the start of the 20th century. These buildings include the [[Vienna City Hall|Rathaus]] (town hall), the [[Burgtheater]], the [[University of Vienna|University]], the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Parliament]], the twin museums of [[Natural History Museum, Vienna|natural history]] and [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|fine art]], and the [[Vienna State Opera|Staatsoper]]. It is also the location of the New Wing of the [[Hofburg]], the former imperial palace, and the Imperial and Royal War Ministry finished in 1913. The mainly [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|Stephansdom]] is located at the center of the city, on [[Stephansplatz, Vienna|Stephansplatz]]. The Imperial-Royal Government set up the Vienna City Renovation Fund (Wiener Stadterneuerungsfonds) and sold many building lots to private investors, thereby partly financing public construction works.

From 1850 to 1890, city limits in the West and the South mainly followed another wall called ''[[Linienwall]]'' at which a [[Road toll (historical)|road toll]] called the ''[[Liniengeld]]'' was charged. Outside this wall from 1873 onwards a [[ring road]] called [[Gürtel, Vienna|''The Gürtel'']] was built. In 1890 it was decided to integrate 33 suburbs (called Vororte) beyond that wall into Vienna by 1 January 1892<ref name="Czeike">Czeike, volume 5, p. 290</ref> and transform them into districts no. 11 to 19 (district no. 10 had been constituted in 1874); hence the Linienwall was torn down beginning in 1894.<ref>Czeike, volume 4, Vienna 1995, {{ISBN|3-218-00546-9}}, p. 69</ref> In 1900, district no. 20, Brigittenau, was created by separating the area from the 2nd district.

From 1850 to 1904, Vienna had expanded only on the eastern bank of the Danube, following the main branch before the regulation of 1868–1875, i.e., the Old Danube of today. In 1904, the 21st district was created by integrating Floridsdorf, Kagran, Stadlau, Hirschstetten, Aspern and other villages on the left bank of the Danube into Vienna, and in 1910 Strebersdorf followed. On 15 October 1938, the Nazis created Great Vienna with 26 districts by merging 97 towns and villages into Vienna, 80 of which were returned to surrounding [[Lower Austria]] in 1954.<ref name="Czeike" /> Since then Vienna has had 23 districts.

Industries are located mostly in the southern and eastern districts. The [[Innere Stadt]] is situated away from the main flow of the [[Danube]], but is bounded by the ''[[Donaukanal]]'' ("Danube canal"). Vienna's second and twentieth districts are located between the Donaukanal and the Danube. Across the Danube, where the Vienna International Centre is located (districts 21–22), and in the southern areas (district 23) are the newest parts of the city.

===Political history===
{{Further|First Austrian Republic|Red Vienna}}
[[File:Wien Rathaus hochauflösend.jpg|thumb|The [[Vienna City Hall|Rathaus]] (''City Hall''), the seat of the local government.]]
In the provinces represented in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]], men had had universal [[suffrage]] at the national level since 1907. Mayor [[Karl Lueger]] of the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] prevented the adoption of this right to vote in municipal council elections, which excluded many working-class people. The first elections in which [[Universal suffrage|all adult men and women]] were entitled to vote took place in 1919 after the end of the monarchy. Since 1919, the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SPÖ) has provided the mayor in all free elections and the Vienna City Council (the city parliament) has had a Social Democratic majority.

On 10 November 1920, the day on which the [[Constitution of Austria|Federal Constitution of Austria]] came into force, which defined Vienna as a separate [[Federal states of Austria|federal state]] and made its separation from [[Lower Austria]] possible. Since then, the [[List of mayors of Vienna|mayor of Vienna]] has also been the governor of the state, the city senate the state government and the municipal council the state parliament. Vienna was used as the seat of the Lower Austrian government until 1997 when they moved to [[Sankt Pölten|St. Pölten]]. 

From 1934 to 1945, during the period of [[Federal State of Austria|Austrofascist]] and [[Austria within Nazi Germany|Nazi]], no democratic elections were held and the city was run as a dictatorship. During this time the SPÖ was banned and many of its members were imprisoned. Vienna's city constitution was reinstated in 1945. 

The city has enacted many social democratic policies. The ''[[Gemeindebau]]ten'' are social housing assets that are well integrated into the city architecture outside the inner district. The low rents enable comfortable accommodation and good access to the city amenities. Many of the projects were built after [[World War II]] on vacant lots that were destroyed by bombing during the war. The city took particular pride in building them to a high standard. The social housing in Vienna provides living for more than 500,000 people.<ref>{{cite web |title=Social Housing in Vienna |url=https://www.wienerwohnen.at/wiener-gemeindebau/municipal-housing-in-vienna.html |website=www.wienerwohnen.at |publisher=City of Vienna |access-date=10 August 2023 |archive-date=10 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230810230349/https://www.wienerwohnen.at/wiener-gemeindebau/municipal-housing-in-vienna.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the 1996 City Council election, the SPÖ lost its overall majority in the 100-seat chamber, winning 43 seats and 39.15% of the vote. The SPÖ had held an outright majority at every free municipal election since 1919. In 1996, the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FPÖ), which won 29 seats (up from 21 in 1991), beat the ÖVP into third place for the second time running. From 1996 to 2001, the SPÖ governed Vienna in a coalition with the ÖVP. In 2001 the SPÖ regained the overall majority with 52 seats and 46.91% of the vote; in October 2005, this majority was increased further to 55 seats (49.09%). In the 2010 city council elections the SPÖ lost their overall majority again and consequently forged a coalition with the [[The Greens – The Green Alternative|Green Party]] – the first SPÖ/Green coalition in Austria.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pakt unterzeichnet: Rot-Grün in Wien nun offiziell |website=news.ORF.at |date=15 November 2010 |url=http://orf.at/stories/2025548/ |access-date=3 January 2011 |archive-date=18 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118193210/http://www.orf.at/stories/2025548 |url-status=live }}</ref> This coalition was maintained following the 2015 election. Following the 2020 election, the SPÖ forged a coalition with [[NEOS – The New Austria and Liberal Forum]]. The [[Next Viennese state election|next elections]] will take place in 2025.

==== Current government ====

The latest elections were held on 11 October 2020. It resulted in an SPÖ-NEOS coalition and [[Michael Ludwig]] was re-elected as mayor.

A variety of architectural styles have been preserved in Vienna, including [[Romanesque architecture]] and [[Baroque architecture]]. [[Art Nouveau]] has left many architectural traces in Vienna. The [[Secession Building, Vienna|Secession building]], [[Karlsplatz Stadtbahn Station]], and the [[Kirche am Steinhof]] by [[Otto Wagner]] rank among the best-known examples of Art Nouveau in the world.

The [[Wiener Moderne]] shunned the use of extraneous adornment. Architect [[Adolf Loos]] is responsible for the [[Looshaus]] (1909), the Kärntner Bar (1908), and the [[Steiner House]] (1910).

In the 1990s, a number of quarters were adapted and extensive building projects were implemented in the areas around [[Donaustadt]] and [[Wienerberg]].

== Danube ==
Vienna is the [[List of cities and towns on the Danube river|largest city]] on the [[Danube]], which runs from the north, through the city, and out the south-east. In Vienna, the river is split into 4 parts:

* The main Danube is the widest of these and is used primarily for shipping.
* The [[New Danube|Neue Donau]] (New Danube) is a side channel on the east of the river. It was built in 1972 for flood protection measures and is separated from the Danube by the man-made [[Donauinsel]]. It runs for about 21 kilometers. The river flows slower than the main Danube and can be used for watersports such as swimming, [[rowing]] or sailing. Motorboats are forbidden on this part of the river. 
* The Alte Donau (Old Danube) is a lake to the east of the New Danube, which cuts off Kaisermühlen from the rest of the city. The lake is the hub for swimmers in Vienna, with freely available piers and beaches. [[Motorboat]]s and [[pedalo]]s are permitted on the lake and can be rented from nearby vendors.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Entspannen an der Wiener Donau |url=https://www.wien.info/de/lebenswertes-wien/wasser-in-wien/entspannen-an-der-wiener-donau-345184 |access-date=6 April 2024 |website=wien.info |language=de |archive-date=6 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240406175154/https://www.wien.info/de/lebenswertes-wien/wasser-in-wien/entspannen-an-der-wiener-donau-345184 |url-status=live }}</ref>
* The [[Donaukanal]] splits off and rejoins the Danube close to the southern and northern edges of the city. Unlike the main river, it flows through the city center. The waterway itself is used mostly by boats, while the paths on both sides of the Donaukanal are regularly used by pedestrians, [[Jogging|joggers]] and cyclists.<ref>{{Cite web |date=30 December 2012 |title=Donaukanal |url=http://aeiou.iicm.tugraz.at/aeiou.encyclop.d/d687058.htm%3Binternal%26action%3D_setlanguage.action?LANGUAGE=en |access-date=15 April 2024 |archive-date=30 December 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121230080933/http://aeiou.iicm.tugraz.at/aeiou.encyclop.d/d687058.htm;internal&action=_setlanguage.action?LANGUAGE=en }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Der Donaukanal |url=https://www.wien.gv.at/umwelt/gewaesser/donaukanal/ |access-date=6 April 2024 |website=www.wien.gv.at |language=de |archive-date=6 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240406175151/https://www.wien.gv.at/umwelt/gewaesser/donaukanal/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Culinary specialities==
=== Food ===
[[File:Wiener-Schnitzel02.jpg|alt=A Wiener schnitzel at a restaurant|thumb|A Wiener schnitzel]]
Vienna is well known for [[Wiener schnitzel]], a cutlet of [[veal]] ''(Kalbsschnitzel)'' (sometimes also made with pork (''Schweinsschnitzel'') or chicken (''Hühnerschnitzel'')) that is pounded flat, coated in flour, egg and breadcrumbs, and fried in [[clarified butter]]. It is available in almost every restaurant that serves [[Viennese cuisine]] and can be eaten hot or cold. The traditional 'Wiener Schnitzel' though is a cutlet of veal. Other examples of Viennese cuisine include ''[[Tafelspitz]]'' (very lean boiled beef), which is traditionally served with ''Geröstete Erdäpfel'' (boiled potatoes mashed with a fork and subsequently fried) and horseradish sauce, ''Apfelkren'' (a mixture of horseradish, cream and apple) and ''Schnittlauchsauce'' (a chives sauce made with mayonnaise and stale bread).

Vienna has a long tradition of producing cakes and desserts. These include ''[[Apple strudel|Apfelstrudel]]'' (hot apple strudel), ''[[Milk-cream strudel|Milchrahmstrudel]]'' (milk-cream strudel), ''[[Palatschinke]]n'' (sweet pancakes), and ''[[Knödel]]'' (dumplings) often filled with fruit such as apricots (''[[Marillenknödel]]''). [[Sachertorte]], a delicately moist chocolate cake with apricot jam created by the [[Hotel Sacher|Sacher Hotel]], is world-famous.
[[File:Sachertorte DSC03027.JPG|thumb|right|Sachertorte]]
In winter, small street stands sell traditional ''[[Chestnut|Maroni]]'' (hot chestnuts) and [[Potato cake|potato fritters]].

Sausages are popular and available from street vendors (''[[Würstelstand]]'') throughout the day and into the night. The sausage known as ''[[Frankfurter Würstchen|Wiener]]'' (German for Viennese) in the U.S. and in Germany, is called a ''Frankfurter'' in Vienna. Other popular sausages are ''Burenwurst'' (a coarse beef and pork sausage, generally boiled), ''[[Käsekrainer]]'' (spicy pork with small chunks of cheese), and ''[[Bratwurst]]'' (a white pork sausage). Most can be ordered "mit Brot" (with bread) or as a "hot dog" (stuffed inside a long roll). Mustard is the traditional condiment and usually offered in two varieties: "süß" (sweet) or "scharf" (spicy).

=== Drinks ===
[[File:Ottakringer Helles in a hotel room.jpg|alt=A yellow can of Ottakringer Helles|thumb|A can of Ottakringer Helles]]
Vienna, along with [[Barcelona]], [[Bratislava]], [[Canberra]], [[Cape Town]], Paris, Prague, [[Santiago]] and [[Warsaw]], is one of the few remaining world capital cities with its own vineyards.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.austria.info/uk/things-to-do/food-and-drink/wine/vienna-the-wine-capital |title=Vienna: The Wine Capital |website=www.austria.info |access-date=20 May 2019 |archive-date=30 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191230111323/https://www.austria.info/uk/things-to-do/food-and-drink/wine/vienna-the-wine-capital |url-status=live }}</ref> The wine is served in small Viennese pubs known as [[Heuriger]]. The wine is often drunk as a Spritzer ("G'spritzter") with sparkling water. The [[Grüner Veltliner]], a dry white wine, is the most widely cultivated wine in Austria.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/grape-209-gruner-veltliner |title=Gruner Veltliner Wine |publisher=Wine-Searcher |access-date=2 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301165955/http://www.wine-searcher.com/grape-209-gruner-veltliner |archive-date=1 March 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Another wine very typical for the region is "Gemischter Satz", which is typically a blend of different types of wines harvested from the same vineyard.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Vienna wine: Gemischter Satz |url=https://www.wien.info/en/shopping-wining-dining/wine/gemischter-satz-awarded-346738 |website=Wien.info |access-date=4 June 2021 |archive-date=4 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210604153753/https://www.wien.info/en/shopping-wining-dining/wine/gemischter-satz-awarded-346738 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Beer is next in importance to wine. Vienna has a single large brewery, [[Ottakringer]], and more than ten [[Vienna microbreweries|microbreweries]]. Ottakringers' most popular drink is the ''Ottakringer Helles'', a beer with an [[Alcohol by volume|alcohol content]] of 5.2%. A "''Beisl''" is a typical small Austrian pub, of which Vienna has many.

Local soft drinks such as [[Almdudler]] are popular around the country as an alternative to alcoholic beverages, placing them on the top spots alongside American counterparts such as [[Coca-Cola]] in terms of market share. Other popular drinks are the [[Spezi]], a mix between cola and orange lemonade, and [[Frucade]], a German carbonated orange drink.

=== Viennese cafés ===
[[File:Palais Lieben-Auspitz Vienna.jpg|thumb|Cafe Landtmann]]

=== Heuriger ===
[[File:Wien Heurigen-Lokal 2014 1.jpg|alt=A Heuriger in Grinzing|thumb|Typical Heuriger in Grinzing]]
Vienna is one of the few major cities with its own [[wine-growing region]]. This wine is sold in taverns, so-called ''[[Heuriger]]'', by the local winemakers during the growing season. The wine is often served as a [[Schorle]], a mix of wine and [[carbonated water]]. The meals are simple and homemade, usually consisting of fresh bread, typically [[Kaiser roll|semmels]], with local [[coldcuts]] and cheese, or [[Liptauer|Liptauer spread]]. The Heurigers are especially numerous in the areas of [[Döbling]] ([[Grinzing]], [[Neustift am Walde]], [[Nussdorf, Vienna|Nußdorf]], [[Salmannsdorf]], [[Sievering]]), [[Floridsdorf]] (Stammersdorf, Strebersdorf), [[Liesing]] ([[Mauer, Vienna|Mauer]]) and [[Favoriten]] (Oberlaa).<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Best Heuriger Vienna: An epic guide to the wine taverns of Vienna |url=https://austrianadaptation.com/blog/the-best-heuriger-vienna-an-epic-guide-to-the-wine-taverns-of-vienna |access-date=19 March 2024 |website=Austrian Adaptation |language=en-US |archive-date=19 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240319224907/https://austrianadaptation.com/blog/the-best-heuriger-vienna-an-epic-guide-to-the-wine-taverns-of-vienna |url-status=live }}</ref>
