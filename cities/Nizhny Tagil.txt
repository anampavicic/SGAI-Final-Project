'''Nizhny Tagil''' ({{lang-rus|Нижний Тагил|p=ˈnʲiʐnʲɪj tɐˈgʲil}}) is a [[classification of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] in [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]], [[Russia]], located {{convert|25|km|sp=us}} east of the [[Boundaries between the continents#Asia and Europe|boundary between Asia and Europe]]. Population: {{ru-census|p2021=338,966|p2010=361,811|p2002=390,498|p1989=439,521}}{{Historical populations|1897|30000|1926|39000|1939|160000|1959|338501|1970|378410|1979|398146|1989|439521|2002|390498|2010|361811|2021|338966|type=|footnote=Source: Census data}}

==History==
The history of Nizhny Tagil dates back to the mid-16th century, when the [[Stroganovs]] received the right to possess land by the [[Kama (river)|Kama]] and [[Chusovaya]] basins. In 1579 they founded the first settlement, the Utkin [[sloboda (settlement)|sloboda]], by the river Utka, the mouth of Chusoya. Fateyevo, the first Russian village in the Tagil region, was founded in 1665.<ref name=History>[http://historyntagil.ru/books/11_8_16.htm Нижний Тагил. 1964. Из летописи Нижнего Тагила]</ref>

In 1696, by the order of Tsar [[Peter the Great]], the Vysokogorsky iron ore quarry was opened. [[Voevode]] Dmitry Protasyev was elected to search for iron and magnetic ores.<ref name=History/> The deposits were particularly rich, and included lodes of pure magnetic iron. The surrounding landscape provided everything needed for a successful and productive mining and smelting operation&nbsp;— rivers for transport, forests for fuel, and suitable climate. Several years later, the Tsar introduced in Russia a special administration on mining.<ref name=History/>

Over the following decades, the city developed as one of the early centers of Russian industrialization, and it has been a major producer of [[cast iron]] and [[steel]]. The town of Nizhny Tagil, home of the factory [[Uralvagonzavod]], is also known for its production of Soviet tanks, including the famous [[T-34]]; nearly every other T-34 was manufactured in Nizhny Tagil.<ref>[https://turizmnt.ru/gorod/legenda/1097/ Каждый третий танк Т-34 сделан в Нижнем Тагиле]</ref>

[[Cherepanov steam locomotive|The first Russian steam locomotive]] was constructed there in 1833, and the father-and-son engineers who developed it, [[Cherepanovs|Yefim and Miron Cherepanov (Черепанов)]], were in 1956 commemorated by an {{convert|8|m|adj=on|sp=us}} bronze statue (executed by sculptor A. S. Kondratyev and architect A. V. Sotnikov) which stands in the center of the Theatrical Square in the heart of downtown.

According to some sources, the copper for the skin of the [[Statue of Liberty]] was mined and refined in Nizhny Tagil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russianamericanbusiness.org/EN/web_CONTENT/articles/2005.01.20/group_05/2_articl/articl.shtml|title=Statue of Liberty Made of Russian Copper?}}</ref> However, research by Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, USA, suggests that the Visnes mine in Norway is the most likely source.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corrosion-doctors.org/Landmarks/statue-copper.htm|title=Statue of Liberty Copper}}</ref>

==Geography==

Neighboring cities include [[Yekaterinburg]] {{convert|130|km|sp=us}} to the south, [[Serov (town)|Serov]] and Priobye in the north, [[Perm, Russia|Perm]] in the west, and [[Alapayevsk]] and [[Verkhnyaya Salda]] in the east.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
