Maluko also happens to be the name of one of the municipality's barangay.<ref>{{Cite PH act|url=https://lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1957/ra_1720_1957.html|number=1720|date=June 21, 1957|title=An Act Changing the Name of the Municipality of Maluko, Province of Bukidnon, to Municipality of Manolo Fortich}}</ref>

==History==
Before the coming of the [[Spanish people|Spaniards]], the term ''"Bukidnon"'' referred to as the semi-sedentary Indigenous inhabitants of the high plateaus and rugged mountain ranges of central Mindanao. The more prominent of these peoples were the [[Manobo people]] who were the earliest settlers of this region. Located on the northern part of Bukidnon, is the Municipality of Manolo Fortich.

[[File:MacArthur Monument in Bukidnon.JPG|thumb|left|The MacArthur Monument in Barangay Diclum, the site of the World War II [[Del Monte Airfield]] from which [[Douglas MacArthur]] was evacuated to Australia from the Philippines after the fall of Corregidor and Bataan]]
[[File:Forest Camp, Dahilayan, Malaybalay Bukidnon.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Forest Camp'' in barangay Dahilayan]]
The great pre-historic Asiatic migration was believed to have brought the early settlers of Bukidnon. It was theorized that they came from places of what is now known as Indonesia. Traveling by the sea, these migrants reached the gulf of Davao where some ventured further to areas of what is now known as Bukidnon and Misamis Oriental. The Asiatic beginnings of these people can be seen from their oral tradition and folktales, like the ''"Kalikat Hu Mga Elaw Dini Ta Mindanao"'' (Origin of the People of Mindanao). This folktale revolved on the story of two brothers from Asia "who crossed the seas" in their long journey "towards the east" which refers to the islands of the Philippines. The brothers reportedly landed in the island of Mindanao. With the region experiencing a drought, one of the brothers was forced to venture Northward in order to survive. He did this by following a dried up river to its almost dried up source, a lake. He settled and inter-married with the local inhabitants in the upstream of what is now known as Pulangi River. He and his family were considered as the ancestors of the present ''Bukidnons''.

During the pre-historic era, the ''Bukidnons'', also called ''Monteses'' or [[mountain-people]], had settled in the area of what is now the Province of Bukidnon. These people have remained traditional till 1860 preserving most of their customs and traditions. Furthermore, these people had not been significantly influenced by the Spanish colonizers because of their isolation. The rugged mountain ranges and high plateaus which serve as home to these people presented an overwhelming obstacle to these colonizers. The ''Bukidnons'' undoubtedly have links to the culture predominant in the Southeast Asian region as evidenced by the similar customs and traditions. Their presence here can be traced to the early migration of these Asians throughout the region. Today, the surviving tribes inhabiting the mountains of Bukidnon still bear the culture they have inherited from their ancestors.

Manolo Fortich is named after Don Manuel "Manolo" González Fortich, a provincial resident of Barrio Damilag who became the first governor (1907-1914) of the Sub-province of Bukidnon. Don Manuel Fortich was born on November 27, 1879, in San Nicolas (now Barangay Basak San Nicolas), [[Cebu City]]. A Philippine Constabulary officer, he served as a guide to [[Dean C. Worcester]] while on expedition to Bukidnon. Upon retirement from government service in 1920, he established ranches in Maluko and Maramag, and acquired 3,000 cows. He died on January 15, 1943, at the age of 64.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sagisag Kultura: Fortich, Manolo| url=https://philippineculturaleducation.com.ph/fortich-manolo/?fbclid=IwAR3nzXR4SsMkNFc8W3MepzNPGmpvcJqiBqxVtvGtM7C3B94dRWS7zTh7aCI |accessdate=February 23, 2023}}</ref>

The original name of the town was Maluko, and was headed by Santiago Mambinonsad who was appointed as Alcalde de Barrio from 1922 to 1924. It was during the term of Ciriaco Asilan as Presidente del Barrio from 1926 to 1928, that the seat of municipal government was permanently transferred to Tangkulan. Mateo Gumaling was the first appointed municipal mayor of Maluko and in 1940 Margarito Cabang became the first elected Mayor.

=== World War II ===
Manolo Fortich was captured by Japanese forces of the Kawamura Detachment of the [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 5th Division]] attacking from Cagayan on May 6, 1942. They advance further eastward two days later.

=== Post-war ===
Maluko was then renamed to ''Manolo Fortich'' by virtue of ''Republic Act No. 1720'' on June 21, 1957.<ref>{{Cite web|title=An Act Changing the Name of the Municipality of Maluko, Province of Bukidnon, to Municipality of Manolo Fortich|url=https://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno1720.html|access-date=February 23, 2023|website=ChanRobles Virtual Law Library}}</ref>&nbsp;<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sagisag Kultura: Fortich, Manolo| url=https://philippineculturaleducation.com.ph/fortich-manolo/?fbclid=IwAR3nzXR4SsMkNFc8W3MepzNPGmpvcJqiBqxVtvGtM7C3B94dRWS7zTh7aCI |accessdate=February 23, 2023}}</ref>
