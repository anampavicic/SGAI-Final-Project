==History==
The area of modern Niiza has been settled since prehistoric times. It was part for Shinra County within [[Musashi Province]] in the [[Nara period]]. Shinra County (新羅郡) was originally written with the same ''[[kanji]]'' as the ancient Korean kingdom of [[Silla]], and the area was settled by immigrants from [[Silla]]  in 758 AD. The name was changed to Niikura County (新座郡) in the [[Heian period]].<ref name="Niiza-hp2">{{cite web |url=https://www.city.niiza.lg.jp/site/bunkazai/bunkazai-niizanoyurai.html |title= Niiza city official history|location= Japan|language= ja}}</ref>

The town of Owada was created within Niikura District, Saitama with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Niikura District was abolished in 1896, becoming part of [[Kitaadachi District, Saitama|Kitaasachi District]].  On March 1, 1955, Owada annexed the neighboring village of Katayama becoming Niiza Town, which was raised to city status on November 1, 1970.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.city.niiza.saitama.jp/language/lang_index.php |title=Niiza City Living Guide |access-date=2006-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914140157/http://www.city.niiza.saitama.jp/language/lang_index.php |archive-date=2009-09-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
