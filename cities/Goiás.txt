'''Goiás''' ({{IPA|pt-BR|ɡo(j)ˈjas|lang|Pt-br Goiás.ogg}}) is a Brazilian [[States of Brazil|state]] located in the [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Midwest]] region. Goiás borders the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]] and the states of (from north clockwise) [[Tocantins]], [[Bahia]], [[Minas Gerais]], [[Mato Grosso do Sul]] and [[Mato Grosso]]. The state capital is [[Goiânia]]. With 7.2 million inhabitants, Goiás is the most populous state in the Midwest and the [[List of Brazilian states by population|11th most populous in the country]]. It has the [[List of Brazilian federative units by gross regional product|ninth largest economy]] among Brazilian federative units. In Brazil's geoeconomic division, Goiás belongs to the [[Centro-Sul]] (Center-South), being the northernmost state of the southern portion of Brazil. The state has 3.3% of the Brazilian population and is responsible for 2.7% of the Brazilian [[GDP]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.jornalopcao.com.br/ultimas-noticias/estudo-revela-que-o-pib-de-goias-atingiu-quase-o-dobro-em-relacao-as-riquezas-nacionais-no-primeiro-ano-de-gestao-de-caiado-363281/ |title=Estudo revela que o PIB de Goiás atingiu quase o dobro em relação as riquezas nacionais |access-date=2 March 2022 |archive-date=2 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220302000114/https://www.jornalopcao.com.br/ultimas-noticias/estudo-revela-que-o-pib-de-goias-atingiu-quase-o-dobro-em-relacao-as-riquezas-nacionais-no-primeiro-ano-de-gestao-de-caiado-363281/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The history of Goiás dates back to the beginning of the 18th century, with the arrival of pioneers from São Paulo. The [[Rio Vermelho]] region was the first to be occupied, where [[Vila Boa, Goiás|Vila Boa]] (later renamed [[Goiás, Goiás|Goiás]]) was founded. The development and settlement of the state took place, in a more intensified way, starting in the 1930s with the founding of the new capital, Goiânia, and especially with the construction of [[Brasília]] in the 1950s.<ref name="Introduction to historia de Goiás">{{Cite web |url = http://www.achetudoeregiao.com.br/go/historia_goias.htm |title = História de Goiás |publisher = Find Everything and Region |date = 11 June 2010 |access-date = February 14, 2016 |archive-date = 8 December 2021 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211208172426/http://www.achetudoeregiao.com.br/go/historia_goias.htm |url-status = live }}</ref>

Goiás is characterized by a landscape of ''[[chapada|chapadões]]'' (plateaus).<!-- Seems to be a good English translation. --> In the height of the drought season, from June to September, the lack of rain makes the level of the [[Araguaia River]] go down and exposes almost {{convert|2|km|mi}} of beaches. At the [[Emas National Park]] in the municipality of [[Mineiros]], it is possible to observe the typical fauna and flora from the region. At the [[Chapada dos Veadeiros]] the main attractions are the canyons, valleys, rapids and waterfalls. Other attractions include the historical [[Goiás, Goiás|city of Goiás]] and the hot springs of [[Caldas Novas]].

==Geography==
[[File:EO_1831-Editar.jpg|thumb|left|Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park]]
[[File:Morro_cabeludo_-_Parque_dos_Pireneus_-_Pirenópolis_-_Goiás_01.jpg|thumb|left|Serra dos Pirineus in Goiás]]

Goiás occupies a large plateau, the vast almost level surface of which stands between 750 and 900 m above sea level and forms the divide between three of Brazil's largest river systems: to the south, Goiás is drained by the [[Paranaíba river]], a tributary of the [[Paraná River]]; to the east it is drained by tributaries of the [[São Francisco River]]; and northward the state is drained by the [[Araguaia River]] and the [[Tocantins River]] and their tributaries. Other major rivers in the state are the [[Meia Ponte River|Meia Ponte]], Aporé, São Marcos, [[Corumbá|Corumbá River]], Claro, [[Maranhão River|Maranhão]], [[Paranã River|Paranã]] and [[Preto River (Paracatu River)|Preto]]. None of these rivers is navigable except for short distances by small craft.

The state's highest point is Pouso Alto, at {{Convert|1676|m|ft}} above sea level, in the Chapada dos Veadeiros.

Goiás is covered with a woodland savanna known in Brazil as campo [[cerrado]], although there are still tropical forests along the rivers. The climate of the plateau is tropical. Average monthly temperatures vary from {{Convert|26|C|F}} in the warmest month to {{Convert|22|C|F}} in the coldest. The year is divided into a rainy season (October–March) and a dry season (April–September). Average annual rainfall is about {{Convert|1700|mm|in}}, but this varies due to elevation and microclimate.
Some parts of the state, however, have small remnants of tropical [[Atlantic forest]], that mostly appears around rivers and valleys.

The Great Midwest Region, consisting of the states of Goiás, [[Mato Grosso]], Mato Grosso do Sul, and the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]], is among the fastest-growing regions of Brazil. The population of Goiás state tripled in size in the period from 1950 to 1980 and is still growing very quickly. However, outside the Federal District and the Goiânia metropolitan region (with a population of over a million) most of Goiás is very thinly populated. The chief concentration of settlement is in the southeast, in the area of [[Goiânia]] (Goiânia and [[Aparecida de Goiânia]]), across the border from [[Minas Gerais]] ([[Catalão]], [[Rio Verde, Goiás|Rio Verde]], [[Jataí]], and [[Caldas Novas]]), and around the Federal District ([[Formosa, Goiás|Formosa]], [[Planaltina de Goiás]], and [[Luziânia]]).

The first European exploration of this interior part of Brazil was carried out by expeditions from [[São Paulo]] in the 17th century. Gold was discovered in the gravel of a tributary of the Araguaia River by the bandeirante [[Bartolomeu Bueno da Silva]] (the Anhanguera) in 1682. The settlement he founded there, called Santa Anna, became the colonial town of [[Goiás Velho]], the former state capital. In 1744 the large inland area, much of it still unexplored by Europeans, was made a [[Captaincy General]], and in 1822 it became a province of the [[empire of Brazil]]. It became a state in 1889. The Brazilian constitution of 1891 specified that the nation's capital should be moved to the Brazilian Highlands ([[Planalto Central]]), and in 1956 Goiás was selected as the site for the federal district and capital national, [[Brasília]]. The seat of the federal government was officially moved to Brasília in 1960.

[[Goiânia]], the largest city and capital was planned in 1933 to replace the old, inaccessible former state capital of Goiás, {{Convert|110|km|mi}} northwest. In 1937 the state government moved there, and in 1942 the official inauguration was held. Goiânia is now one of the fastest-growing cities in Brazil and one of the most livable cities in the country.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} It stands out as both an industrial center (along with the neighboring towns of [[Anápolis]] and [[Aparecida de Goiânia]]) and as a cultural center for country culture and music, known as [[Música sertaneja|Sertanejo]].

Due to the relatively large territory of the state, which was over {{Convert|600000|km2|mi2}}, communications were obviously very difficult. The northern part of the state began to feel abandoned by the southern government and began a movement for separation. Local political leaders also encouraged the movement. In 1988 the northern half of Goiás became a separate state called [[Tocantins (state)|Tocantins]].

==Flag==
The green bars in the flag symbolize the spring and the yellow bars gold. The blue rectangle in the topleft corner symbolizes the sky, with the five stars forming the [[constellation]] of the [[Crux|Southern Cross]]. The flag was adopted on 30 July 1919. It is a toned down version of the original Republican [[flag of Brazil]], in itself not original.
