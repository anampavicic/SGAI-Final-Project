It has two [[niaba]]s: [[Sinaw]] and [[Samad Ash Shan]]. Suq Sinaw is one of the most popular suqs in Oman. Dresses, [[khanjar]]s and jewelry are sold there. It includes villages like Al Sudairah, Barzman, and Al Zahib.

On 25 November 2019, 45 well-preserved tombs covering a 50-80 square metre area and a settlement, dating back to beginning of the [[Iron Age]], has been discovered in Al-Mudhaibi, specifically in Al Saleeli mountain by archaeologists from [[Oman]] and [[Heidelberg University]]. Archaeologists believed that the site belonged to the miners who were working in copper mining.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofoman.com/article/2281861/Oman/New-archeological-site-discovered-in-Oman|title=New archeological site discovered in Oman|website=Times of Oman|date=25 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Heyman |first=Taylor |date=26 November 2019 |title=Iron Age archaeological site discovered in Oman |work=The National |url=https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/gcc/iron-age-archaeological-site-discovered-in-oman-1.943021 |access-date=31 January 2023}}</ref>
