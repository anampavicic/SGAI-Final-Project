==Etymology==
The original name of the city was Duzzap (Persian: ''Duzdab'', meaning "Water Stolen"), which it had received due to the abrupt floods into the valley. The name was later changed to Zahedan (Persian for "hermits") during [[Reza Shah]]'s visit in 1929.{{sfn|Dudoignon|2017|p=119}}

== History ==
[[File:Makki Mosque in Zahedan.jpg|thumb|[[Makki Mosque]]]]
[[File:Ali Ibn Abi Talib (AS) Mosque.jpg|thumb|Ali Ibn Abi Talib Mosque]]
Mention of Zahedan first appears in sources in August 1849. However, the city first truly started to grow during the early 20th-century.{{sfn|Dudoignon|2017|pp=118–119}} During [[World War I]] it became the westernmost terminal of the [[Zahedan railway station]], which reached as far as [[Quetta]] in the northern part of what was then [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioner's Province)|British Baluchistan]].{{sfn|Bosworth|2002|p=387}}

===Population===
While the surrounding area boasts numerous ancient sites, Zahedan itself primarily developed in the 20th century.

After 1980, large numbers of refugees fleeing the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] helped triple the population of Zahedan to more than 281,000 by 1986, a number which has since doubled again.{{cn|date=June 2024}}
