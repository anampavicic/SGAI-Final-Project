'''Norzagaray''', officially the '''Municipality of Norzagaray''' ({{lang-tgl|Bayan ng Norzagaray}}),  is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Bulacan]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 136,064 people.{{PH census|current}}

It is the location of [[Angat Dam]] which sits on the lower realms of the Sierra Madre Mountain range, the Dam is notable for being a major water and power supply for the [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]].

==History==
[[File:Teniente coronel Fernando Norzagaray.png|thumb|left|175px|[[Fernándo Norzagaray y Escudero]]]]
The nucleus of what today is the town of Norzagaray traces from the old barrio ''Casay'' and barrio ''Matictic'' which was ecclesiastically and politically administered by the Augustinians from the town of [[Angat, Bulacan|Angat]] as its visitas as shown in the document "''Mapa del Teritorio de Bulacan''" by Fray Emmanuel Blanco, [[Order of Saint Augustine|O.S.A.]] in 1832 which appeared in another document "''Administracion Espiritual de los Padres Agustinos calzados de la Provincia del Dulce Nombre de Jesus de las Islas Filipinas''" of Fray Francisco Villacorta in 1833.

The people of Barrio Casay worked for reforms politically, socially and economically, in order to be separated from Angat. They succeeded in their separation bid through [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Fernándo Norzagaray y Escudero]], who issued a Real Cedula declaring barrio Casay together with barrio Matictic to be constituted as a new independent town from Angat. Political boundaries of Angat and ''Pueblo de Casay y Matictic'' were demarcated and the newly created town was renamed as "Norzagaray" in honor of the Governor-General.

During the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American occupation of the Philippines]], Norzagaray was returned to Angat by virtue of Act No. 932 beginning in 1903.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=932|date=October 8, 1903|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%20932|title=An Act Reducing the Twenty-five Municipalities of the Province of Bulacan to Thirteen|accessdate=July 3, 2023|publisher=Senate of the Philippines Legislative Digital Resources}}</ref>

==Geography==
The town of Norzagaray is bordered by [[San Jose del Monte]], [[Bulacan]] and [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Rodriguez]], [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]] to the south; by [[General Nakar]], [[Quezon (province)|Quezon]] to the east; [[Santa Maria, Bulacan|Santa Maria]] to the west; [[Angat, Bulacan]] to the north-west; and [[Doña Remedios Trinidad, Bulacan]] to the north. Norzagaray is {{convert|48|km}} from [[Malolos]], {{convert|47|km}} from [[Manila]], and {{convert|17|km}} from [[San Jose del Monte]].

Norzagaray was previously part of the 3rd district of Bulacan from 1987 to 2022, when it was moved to the newly created 6th district along with Angat and Santa Maria.

===Barangays===
Norzagaray is politically subdivided into 13 [[barangay]]s. Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].

Friendship Village Resources (FVR) was created as a barangay out of barangay Tigbe under ''Sangguniang Panlalawigan Kapasiyahan Bilang 179-T 2002'' and ''Sangguniang Panlalawigan Kautusan Bilang 003'' on April 18, 2002; it was ratified on October 12, 2002.

Their language is currently endangered and is in dire need of local government intervention. The majority of residents in the town are native speakers of the [[Tagalog language]].

==Tourism==
[[File:JfPBuhangin7065StaMariaPYantokAngatBulacanfvf 11.JPG|thumb|Welcome Arch]]
Today, the town of Norzagaray is quickly rising in terms of commercial and economic status with tourist potentials.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} "Bakas" which is on a portion of the [[Angat River]] is recognized as one of the busiest places in the locality, particularly during summertime.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} People from distant towns often visit the place for relaxation.

Another potential spot for tourism is the [[Angat Watershed Forest Reserve]] where the Angat River Hydroelectric Plant or [[Angat Dam]] is located.{{speculation inline|date=May 2023}} The dam is the biggest [[hydroelectric plant]] the [[National Power Corporation]] (NPC) has ever constructed in terms of power capacity within the entire Philippines. Because of Angat Dam's size, its reservoir sinks to critical levels during the dry season necessitating the need for [[cloud seeding]] in some years.  The {{convert|37|km|adj=on|sp=us}} [[reservoir]] of this hydroelectric plant is covered with forests producing a cool climate.

Another is the Pinagrealan Cave located in Barangay Bigte. This cave is a subterranean network of caverns extending more than a kilometer deep. The Katipunero Revolutionaries during the war against Spain used it as a camp in 1896 and again during the Filipino-American War in 1898 as hideout of General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] (the First President of the Philippines). It was also used as a sanctuary by the Japanese Imperial Army when the Philippines was liberated by joint Filipino and American Forces.

There are still other sites with tourism potential in the locality. However, some of these places are located in remote areas of the town, which are inaccessible to motor vehicles, therefore in need of immediate attention.

=== Historical and Cultural Heritage ===
The natives are religious and hear Mass or pray at places of worship, especially Catholic and Iglesia Ni Cristo churches. The town also remembers the 31 heroes of the Revolution.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[Ayala Corporation|Ayala]]-owned [[Manila Water]] Co. Inc. will implement the project.

Just as the national government, the municipal government is divided into three branches: executive, legislative and judiciary. The judicial branch is administered solely by the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]. The LGUs have control of the executive and legislative branch.

The executive branch is composed of the governor for the provinces, mayor for the cities and municipalities, and the barangay captain for the barangays.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090326164110/http://www.dilg.gov.ph/pdf/LGC%20Book%203.pdf Local Government Code of the Philippines, Book III] [[Department of the Interior and Local Government]] official website</ref> The legislative branch is composed of the [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan]] (provincial assembly) for the provinces, Sangguniang Panlungsod (city assembly) for the cities, Sangguniang Bayan (town assembly) for the municipalities, Sangguniang Barangay (barangay council), and the [[Sangguniang Kabataan]] for the youth sector.

The seat of government is vested upon the Mayor and other elected officers who hold office at the municipal hall. The Sangguniang Bayan is the center of legislation of the municipality.
