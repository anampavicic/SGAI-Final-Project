{{nihongo|'''Toyota'''|豊田市|Toyota-shi|{{IPA|ja|toꜜjota ɕi|pron}}}}, formerly known as '''Koromo''', is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] in [[Aichi Prefecture]], Japan. {{As of|2019|10|01}}, the city had an estimated population of 426,162 and a population density of 464 people per km<sup>2</sup>. The total area was {{convert|918.32|sqkm|sqmi}}. It is located about 50 minutes from [[Nagoya]] by way of the [[Meitetsu Toyota Line]].

Several of [[Toyota|Toyota Motor Corporation]]'s manufacturing plants, including the Tsutsumi plant, are located there. The longstanding ties between the Toyota Motor Corporation and the town of Toyota, formerly known as {{Nihongo|Koromo|挙母市|Koromo-shi}}, gave the town its current name. The city's flag (and seal), is a [[unicursal hexagram]].

==Geography==
Toyota is located in north-central Aichi Prefecture, and is the largest city in the prefecture in terms of area. The city area is mountainous to the north, with peaks averaging around 1000 feet (328 m) in height along its northern border with Nagano and Gifu Prefectures. Much of the mountainous northern portion of the city is within the [[Aichi Kōgen Quasi-National Park]].

Toyota is within a two-hour drive of [[Nagoya]].<ref name=Jacob>Jacob, Vinod.

== History ==
{{More citations needed section|date=April 2017}}

===Origins===
The area of present-day Toyota City has been inhabited since prehistoric times, and archaeologists have found a continuous record of artifacts from the [[Japanese paleolithic]] period onwards.
In early proto-historic times, the area was under the control of the [[Mononobe clan]], who built numerous ''[[kofun]]'' burial mounds. The local place name "'''Koromo'''" is mentioned in the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and other early Japanese documents.

=== Edo period ===
During the [[Edo period]], parts of the area of the current city were under the control of [[Koromo Domain]], a [[Han system|feudal ''han'']] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]; however, most of the area of the current city was ''[[tenryō]]'' territory controlled directly by the government in [[Edo]] and administered through ''[[hatamoto]]'' class appointed administrators. The village of "Matsudaira", from which [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] took his clan name, was located within what is now the city of Toyota.

===Meiji period===
After the [[Meiji restoration]], the area was organized into the towns of Asuke and Koromo and numerous villages under [[Higashikamo District, Aichi|Higashikamo District]] and [[Nishikamo District, Aichi|Nishikamo District]] with the establishment of the modern municipalities system.

The area was a major producer of [[silk]] and prospered from the [[Meiji period]] through the [[Taishō period]]s. As the demand for raw silk declined in Japan and abroad, Koromo entered a period of gradual decline after 1930.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/jp-23-.html|title=Municipalities of Aichi (Japan)|access-date=22 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021050911/http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/jp-23-.html|archive-date=21 October 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The decline encouraged [[Kiichiro Toyoda]], cousin of [[Eiji Toyoda]], to look for alternatives to the family's automatic [[loom]] manufacturing business. The search led to the founding of what became the [[Toyota|Toyota Motor Corporation]]. Toyota built the first manufacturing facility, known as [[Toyota Honsha plant]] in November 1938, breaking ground in December 1935.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/data/automotive_business/production/production/japan/general_status/honsha.html |title=Toyota Honsha Plant history |access-date=2015-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306074306/http://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/data/automotive_business/production/production/japan/general_status/honsha.html |archive-date=2015-03-06 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Modern history===
On March 1, 1951, Koromo gained city status, and absorbed the village of Takahashi from Nishikamo District on September 30, 1956. Due to the fame and economic importance of its major employer, the city of {{nihongo|Koromo|挙母市|}} changed its name to Toyota on January 1, 1959.

Toyota became a sister city with [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Michigan]], [[United States]] in 1960. It continued to expand by annexing the towns of Kamigo (Hekikai District) on March 1, 1964, and Takaoka (Hekikai District) on September 1, 1965, and Sanage (Nishikamo District) on April 1, 1967, as well as the village of Matsudaira (Higashikamo District) on April 1, 1970.

In 1979 the [[Nagoya Railroad]] (Meitetsu) opened the Toyota New Line (now [[Meitetsu Toyota Line|Toyota Line]]), and in 1988: The [[Aichi Loop Line]] was opened, thus considerably improving access to the city via rail transport.
