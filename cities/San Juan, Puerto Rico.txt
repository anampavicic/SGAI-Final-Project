The [[Taíno]] people were the original inhabitants of the area before the arrival of the [[European colonization of the Americas|Europeans]] to the island of [[Puerto Rico]] in 1493.

In 1508, [[Juan Ponce de León]] founded the original settlement which he called [[Caparra Archaeological Site|'''Caparra''']]. It was named after a [[Cáparra|former Roman city]] in the province of [[Caceres (province)|Cáceres]] in Spain,<ref>Río-Miranda Alcón, J.

A year later, the settlement was moved to a site then called '''Puerto Rico''', Spanish for "rich port" or "good port", after its similar geographical features to the town of [[Puerto Rico de Gran Canaria]] in the [[Canary Islands]].<ref name="Caparra">{{cite web|publisher=National Park Service|title=Historic places in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nR/travel/prvi/pr27.htm|access-date=2007-05-02|archive-date=May 13, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513201507/http://www.cr.nps.gov/nR/travel/prvi/pr27.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Juan de Puerto Rico|local Catholic diocese]], the second oldest in the Americas and the oldest in the United States, was founded in the newly built settlement on August 8 of 1511.<ref>{{Cite web|title=American Latino Theme Study: Religion (U.S. National Park Service)|url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/latinothemereligion.htm|access-date=2021-11-15|website=www.nps.gov|language=en}}</ref> In 1521, the newer settlement was given its formal name: '''''Ciudad de Puerto Rico de San Juan Bautista'''''. Many of the oldest European-founded institutions in the Western Hemisphere, such as the [[Galería Nacional|Santo Tomás de Aquino Convent]] and the Nuestra Señora de la Concepción Hospital, were established during this time in San Juan.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Marley|first=David|title=Historic Cities of the Americas|year=2005|isbn=1576070271|location=Santa Barbara, CA|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|pages=185+|language=English}}</ref>

The ambiguous use of ''San Juan Bautista'' and ''Puerto Rico'' for both the city and the island in time led to a reversal in practical use by most inhabitants: by 1746 the name for the city (Puerto Rico) had become that of the entire island, leading to the city being identified as ''Puerto Rico de Puerto Rico'' on maps of the era.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.nypl.org/mss/2272|work=New York Public Library|title=Nueva España documents and transcripts, ca. 1700-ca. 1799|access-date=November 21, 2015|archive-date=January 2, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102071102/http://archives.nypl.org/mss/2272|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="HistoryS.J.">{{cite web|title=Historia de San Juan de Puerto Rico |language=es |publisher=Vive San Juan |year=2006 |url=http://www.vivesanjuan.com/historia.htm |access-date=2007-05-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501112503/http://www.vivesanjuan.com/historia.htm |archive-date=May 1, 2007 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.yale.edu/gsp/colonial/puerto-rico/index.html Puerto Rico].

=== Spanish Colonial era ===
{{See also|Captaincy General of Puerto Rico}}
San Juan, as a settlement of the [[Spanish Empire]], was used by merchant and military ships traveling from Spain as the first stopover in the [[Americas]]. Because of its prominence in the Caribbean, a network of fortifications was built to protect the transports of gold and silver from the [[New World]] to Europe. Because of the rich cargoes, San Juan became a target of the foreign powers of the time.<ref>{{cite web|title=San Juan National Historic Site|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/saju/faq.html#3|publisher=National Park Service|year=2000|access-date=2007-05-29|archive-date=March 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313142618/http://www.nps.gov/pwr/404.htm#3|url-status=live}}</ref>

San Juan underwent attacks from the English led by [[Sir Francis Drake]] in 1595 (in what is known as the [[Battle of Puerto Rico]]) and by [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland|George Clifford, Earl of Cumberland]], in 1598. Artillery from San Juan's fort, [[Fort San Felipe del Morro|El Morro]], repelled Drake; however, Clifford managed to land troops and lay siege to the city.<ref name="history">{{cite web|title=History of Puerto Rico|publisher=Sol Boricua|year=2000|url=http://www.solboricua.com/history.htm|author=William Figueroa|language=es|access-date=2007-05-02|archive-date=March 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306100715/http://www.solboricua.com/history.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> After a few months of English occupation, Clifford was forced to abandon the siege when his troops began to suffer from exhaustion and sickness. In 1625 the city was sacked by Dutch forces led by Captain [[Boudewijn Hendricksz|Balduino Enrico]] (also known as Boudewijn Hendricksz/Bowdoin Henrick), but El Morro withstood the assault and was not taken. The Dutch were counterattacked by Captain [[Juan de Amézqueta]] and 50 members of the civilian militia on land and by the cannons of the Spanish troops in El Morro castle.

The Dutch ships at sea were boarded by Puerto Ricans who defeated those aboard. After a long battle, the Spanish soldiers and volunteers of the city's militia were able to defend the city from the attack and save the island from an invasion. On October 21, Enrico set [[La Fortaleza]] and the city ablaze. Captains Amézqueta and Andrés Botello decided to put a stop to the destruction and led 200 men in an attack against the enemy's front and rear guard. They drove Enrico and his men from their trenches and into the ocean in their haste to reach their ships.<ref name="PRH">[http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/1/2/2/7/12272/12272.htm The History of Puerto Rico From the Spanish Discovery to the American Occupation / Middeldyk, R.A.

The British [[Battle of San Juan (1797)|attack]] in 1797, during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], led by [[Ralph Abercromby|Sir Ralph Abercromby]] (who had just conquered [[Trinidad]]). His army laid siege to the city but was forced to withdraw in defeat as the Puerto Rican defenses proved more resilient than those of Trinidad. Various events and circumstances, including liberalized commerce with Spain, the opening of the island to immigrants as a direct result of the [[Royal Decree of Graces of 1815]], and the colonial revolutions, led to an expansion of San Juan and other Puerto Rican settlements in the late 18th and early 19th century.

The architecture of San Juan is very diverse, due to its size and all the cultural influences received during its existence. The oldest part of the city, known as [[Old San Juan]], mostly features the influence of [[Spanish architecture]]. This part of the city is comprised by a network of [[Sett (paving)|"setted" roads]] usually surrounded by colonial, two-storied houses built on [[masonry]]. Some colonial structures have been restored and serve either as government offices or museums.<ref name="Grupo Editorial EPRL">{{cite web|url=http://www.enciclopediapr.org/pr_new/viejo_sanjuan.php |title=Viejo San Juan |work=Enciclopedia Puerto Rico |author=Grupo Editorial EPRL |access-date=November 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723220237/http://www.enciclopediapr.org/pr_new/viejo_sanjuan.php |archive-date=July 23, 2013 }}</ref> Some examples are the [[Ballajá Barracks]], which now serve as museum and headquarters of several cultural organizations; [[La Fortaleza]], which has served as the residence of the [[Governor of Puerto Rico]] since the 16th Century; and the Ancient Welfare Asylum, which now houses the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture, among others. Old San Juan also features several public squares, like the [[Plaza de Armas, San Juan|Plaza de Armas]], located in front of San Juan City Hall; and cathedrals, like the [[Catedral Metropolitana Basílica de San Juan Bautista (San Juan, Puerto Rico)|Cathedral of San Juan Bautista]].<ref name="Grupo Editorial EPRL" /> Old San Juan is also notable for being partly enclosed by [[City Wall of San Juan|massive walls]] and fortifications built by the [[Spanish government]]. The colonial Walls of the city of San Juan had five gates. The main was the Puerta de San Juan, today preserved, built in 1635. It also had the Puerta de San José, the Puerta de Santa Rosa, the Puerta de San Justo and the Puerta de Santiago, the latter built between 1635 and 1641 by Spanish Captain General Íñigo de la Mota Sarmiento.

The architecture is more varied in other districts of the city, and the different [[Spanish architecture|Spanish]], [[Architecture of the United States|American]] and [[List of Puerto Rican architects|Puerto Rican]] construction styles that reflect the historic architecture trends are most evident in the districts of [[Puerta de Tierra, San Juan|Puerta de Tierra]], [[Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico|Santurce]], [[Hato Rey]] and [[Pueblo, San Juan, Puerto Rico|downtown Río Piedras]], with [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], [[Art Deco]], and [[Mid-century modern|Mid-Century Modern]] being the most popular styles.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-12-13 |title=San Juan, Puerto Rico Is a Supremely Underrated Historic Architectural Goldmine |url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/san-juan-architecture-tour |access-date=2022-12-23 |website=Architectural Digest |language=en-US}}</ref> Many of the buildings that best exemplify these architectural trends in San Juan are also inscribed in the [[United States National Register of Historic Places listings|United States National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP), such as the [[Nuestra Señora de Lourdes Chapel]] ([[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]], 1907),<ref>{{cite news |author=González Bolívar, Janet |date=March 26, 2009 |title=La histórica Capilla Nuestra Señora de Lourdes ofrece concierto |newspaper=[[Primera Hora (Puerto Rico)|Primera Hora]] |url=http://www.primerahora.com/lahistoricacapillanuestrasenoradelourdesofrececoncierto-285896.html |access-date=December 24, 2022 |archive-date=May 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508044942/http://www.primerahora.com/lahistoricacapillanuestrasenoradelourdesofrececoncierto-285896.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> the [[Antiguo Casino de Puerto Rico]] ([[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]], 1917),<ref name="nrhpdoc">{{cite web |author=A.

[[File:San Juan and Rio Piedras municipalities (cropped).jpg|thumb|San Juan and Rio Piedras as separate municipalities on a 1915 map]]

As with the other Puerto Rican municipalities, San Juan is administratively divided into ''[[Barrios of Puerto Rico|barrios]].'' What is now known as [[Old San Juan]] occupied the western end of a rocky islet, the [[Isleta de San Juan]], at the mouth of San Juan Bay. During the 20th century, the main population centers surged well beyond the walls of the old city and onto Puerto Rico's main island and merged with the existing settlements east and south of Old San Juan. Together with [[Puerta de Tierra, San Juan|Puerta de Tierra]], Old San Juan comprises the barrio of [[San Juan Antiguo]].

With the annexation of [[Río Piedras, Puerto Rico|Río Piedras]] in 1951, the municipality of San Juan grew to four times its previous size. As a result, the municipality also went from 2 to 18 barrios (barrios),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://welcome.topuertorico.org/maps/sanjuan.pdf |title=San Juan map: Municipo de San Juan |publisher=Welcome.topuertorico.org |access-date=2012-11-25 |archive-date=October 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201003180207/https://welcome.topuertorico.org/maps/sanjuan.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> 16 of which fall within the former municipality of [[Río Piedras]]. Eight of the 18 barrios are further subdivided into subbarrios, including the two barrios ([[San Juan Antiguo]] and [[Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico|Santurce]]) that belonged to the original municipality of San Juan.

The 18 barrios are:

[[File:San Juan 3.jpg|thumb|right|Some streets in Old San Juan are still paved with blue [[cobblestones]] from the Spanish colonial era]]

During the Spanish colonial times most of the urban population resided in what is today known as [[Old San Juan]]. This sector is located on the western half of a small island called the [[Isleta de San Juan]], which is connected to the mainland by two bridges and a [[causeway]]. The small island, which comprises an area of {{convert|47|sqmi}}, also hosts the working-class neighborhood of [[Puerta de Tierra]] and most of Puerto Rico's [[Executive Departments of the Government of Puerto Rico|central government]] buildings, including the [[Puerto Rico Capitol|Commonwealth's Capitol]]. This is also the largest and most populated ''subbarrio'' of San Juan Antiguo.<ref name="2010 Census">{{cite book |url=https://permanent.access.gpo.gov/gpo35934/cph-2-53.pdf |title=Puerto Rico: 2010 Population and housing unit counts |publisher=U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration, U.S. Census Bureau |year=2010 |page=76 |access-date=2019-04-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220183043/https://permanent.access.gpo.gov/gpo35934/cph-2-53.pdf |archive-date=2017-02-20 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The main central part of the old city is characterized by narrow streets made of blue [[cobblestone]] and picturesque colonial buildings, some of which date back to the 16th and 17th century. Sections of the old city are surrounded by massive walls and several defensive structures and notable forts. These include the 16th-century [[Fort San Felipe del Morro]] and the 17th-century [[Castillo San Cristóbal (San Juan)|Fort San Cristóbal]], both part of [[San Juan National Historic Site]], and the 16th-century [[La Fortaleza|El Palacio de Santa Catalina]], also known as [[La Fortaleza]], which serves as the governor's mansion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/60sjspanish/60sanjuan.htm|title=Los Castillos del Viejo San Juan|language=es|publisher=National Park Service|access-date=2007-05-06|archive-date=April 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412063451/http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/60sjspanish/60sanjuan.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

Santurce is the largest and most populated barrio in the municipality of San Juan, and one of the most densely populated areas of the island (13,257.4 persons per square mile).<ref>{{cite web |title=Link to Puerto Rico – San Juan |url=http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/Link%20P.R/www.linktopr.com/sanjuan.html |access-date=November 29, 2012 |work=Proyecto Salón Hogar |language=es}}</ref> Santurce, originally named ''San Mateo de Cangrejos'' (Saint Matthew of the Crabs), was a settlement for [[Freedman|freed African slaves]] during the early days of the city. After Pablo Ubarri Capetillo, a Spanish railroad developer and ''Count of San José de Santurce'' under the Spanish colonial period, sought permission to link San Juan with Río Piedras proper via steam tramway in 1878, the time it took to travel between both points were shortened and thereby stimulated the colonization and growth of the district. At the beginning of the twentieth century an electric trolley was installed, the township was split into three parts, and its main settlement, merged with the city, was renamed using the Spanish spelling of [[Santurtzi]] (''[[Saint George]]'' in Basque), Ubarri's birthplace in [[Biscay|Vizcaya]], Spain. The "Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico" ([[Puerto Rico Museum of Art]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mapr.org/|title=Official site of the Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico|language=es|publisher=Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico|year=2006|access-date=2007-05-06|archive-date=March 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306085246/http://www.mapr.org/|url-status=live}}</ref> and other important cultural venues are located in Santurce.

This barrio is further divided into subbarrios such as the tourist-oriented neighborhood of [[Condado (Santurce)|Condado]], which occupies land that used to be owned by Ubarri Capetillo. Beaches such as nearby [[Ocean Park (Santurce)|Ocean Park]], popular with swimmers, [[surfers]] and [[kitesurfers]], are found all along the district's Atlantic coastline which is also the locus of numerous hotels.<ref>{{cite web |year=2007 |title=Puerto Rico Cheap Hotels: Condado, Old San Juan, Isla Verde and Ocean Park budget hotels |url=http://www.puertoricocheaphotels.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419025520/http://puertoricocheaphotels.com/ |archive-date=April 19, 2018 |access-date=2007-05-06 |publisher=Hola San Juan}}</ref> [[Miramar (Santurce)|Miramar]] is mainly a residential area rising south of the Condado Lagoon. It comprises the former ''[[barrio]]'' of Miraflores, as well as drained marshland and landfill over which was built San Juan's first airport, the Isla Grande airport, which was renamed [[Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport]] in honor of Major [[Fernando Luis Ribas-Dominicci]] (USAF). Miramar now hosts the [[Puerto Rico Convention Center]] as well as some of San Juan Harbor's cruise ship piers. In 2005 Miramar was designated an historical district of Puerto Rico.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miramarpr.com/|title=Informese: Miramar designated a historical district|publisher=MiramarPR|year=2007|access-date=2007-05-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014192026/http://miramarpr.com/|archive-date=October 14, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

South of Santurce is [[Hato Rey]], part of the former municipality of Río Piedras. Hato Rey was grazing ground for cattle owned by the royal government (hence its name, the ''King's Herd'' in Spanish) as early as the 16th century,<ref name="mini-wall-street" /> and is now considered the financial center of the island. A section of this district is often referred to as ''[[Milla de Oro]]'' (actually {{convert|0.47|mi|km|2|disp=or|sp=us}} long) due in part to the many banks and businesses located there.<ref name="mini-wall-street">{{cite web|url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2004/vol8n47/PRSST0847-en.shtml|title=Eatin' Where The Cows Used To Roam: Hato Rey Dining At Its Best|author=Brenda A.

In the southern part of the city is the socially diversified community of [[Río Piedras]]. Founded in the mid-1850s, Río Piedras was a separate town which hosted sugar cane plantations and the estates of some of San Juan's wealthiest inhabitants (as well as their working-class staff). The Spanish colonial governors also had their summer home there on land which eventually gave way to the main campus of the [[University of Puerto Rico]]. In 1951 the municipalities of San Juan and Río Piedras were merged to redefine San Juan's current city limits. Today Río Piedras comprises the largest area of the municipality of San Juan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Official site of the University of Puerto Rico|url=http://www.uprrp.edu/|language=es|publisher=Universidad de Puerto Rico|year=2007|access-date=2007-05-06|archive-date=March 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306033946/http://www.uprrp.edu/|url-status=live}}</ref> and is home to the "Plaza del Mercado" (Río Piedras [[Marketplace]]), the main campus and the Medical Sciences campus of the [[University of Puerto Rico]] and the [[San Juan Botanical Garden]].

For this reason, population data and land area for the period make reference only to the Antiguo San Juan and Santurce ''barrios'', or subdivisions, of San Juan. The old municipality of Río Piedras constituted the third most populated city of Puerto Rico at the time of its annexation in 1951. Its strategic location south of the capital served as a junction for all the principal ways of transportation of the island and as a geographical entry to San Juan, which are factors that prompted Río Piedras's dramatic urban development in the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Río Piedras: Centro de transportación |url=https://enciclopediapr.org/content/rio-piedras-centro-de-transportacion/ |access-date=2022-12-23 |website=EnciclopediaPR |date=December 29, 2009 |language=en-US}}</ref>

On March 8, 1948, the city government of San Juan officially adopted as the city's first flag an orange field, in the center of which is the coat of arms of the city. The orange color was based and taken from Father [[Diego de Torres Vargas]]' text and it reads:

"''Escudo de armas dado a Puerto Rico por los Reyes Católicos en el año de 1511, siendo Procurador un vecino llamado Pedro Moreno. Son : un cordero blanco con su banderilla colorada, sobre un libro, y todo sobre una isla verde, que es la de Puerto Rico, y por los lados una F y una I, que quiere decir Fernando e Isabel, los Reyes Católicos que se las dieron, y hoy se conservan en el estandarte real, que es de damasco anaranjado, con que se ganó la ciudad''".<ref name="LexJuris (Leyes y Jurisprudencia) de Puerto Rico 2020">{{cite web|date=19 February 2020|title=San Juan|url=http://www.lexjuris.com/pueblos/pueblos_files/SANJUAN.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200219000511/http://www.lexjuris.com/pueblos/pueblos_files/SANJUAN.html|archive-date=19 February 2020|access-date=17 September 2020|website=LexJuris (Leyes y Jurisprudencia) de Puerto Rico|language=es}}</ref>

The [[San Juan–Caguas–Guaynabo metropolitan area|San Juan Metropolitan Area]] is served by two airports:

The '''[[Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport]]''' (SJU), San Juan's primary commercial airport, is located eight miles ({{convert|8|mi|abbr=out|1|disp=output only}}) from [[Old San Juan]] in the neighboring municipality of [[Carolina, Puerto Rico|Carolina]]. The airport accommodates more than 30 domestic and international airlines and is the busiest airport in the [[Caribbean]]. It is often referred to as ''The Gateway to the Caribbean'' because it serves as the main connection to the island and the rest of the Caribbean for the United States and vice versa.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Caribbean International Airports|url=https://www.caribbeanislands.com/airports/|access-date=2022-02-12|website=www.caribbeanislands.com|archive-date=February 12, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220212074427/https://www.caribbeanislands.com/airports/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The area's secondary airport is the '''[[Fernando Ribas Dominicci Airport]]''' (SIG), located directly across the [[San Antonio Channel]] (''Caño San Antonio'') from Old San Juan in the [[Isla Grande (Santurce)|Isla Grande]] district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prpa.gobierno.pr/APMain.aspx |title=Autoridad de puertos de Puerto Rico official website |language=es |publisher=Autoridad de Puertos de Puerto Rico |access-date=2007-05-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007181239/http://www.prpa.gobierno.pr/apmain.aspx |archive-date=October 7, 2009 }}</ref> Dominicci Airport is used mainly by general aviation aircraft, charter flights and some domestic commercial flights. It used to be the city's and also the island of Puerto Rico's main international gateway until the opening of Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport. It is now also widely used by the Isla Grande Flight School and Caribbean Flight Center, the only flight school on the island.

[[File:SanJuan-Condado-IslaVerde.gif|thumb|The T5, 21 and 53 buses pass between Old San Juan, Condado and Isla Verde.]]

In an attempt to decrease vehicle dependency and road congestion, the city built a [[rapid transit|metro]] system dubbed "[[Tren Urbano]]" ("Urban Train"). The {{convert|10.7|mi|adj=on}} line connects to 16&nbsp;stations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alternativa de Transporte Integrado homepage|publisher=Departamento de Trasportación Publica|year=2006|url=http://www.ati.gobierno.pr/|language=es|access-date=2007-05-08|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505011816/http://www.ati.gobierno.pr/|archive-date=May 5, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The project, which opened in late 2004, cost $2.25&nbsp;billion and was more than $1&nbsp;billion over budget and four years late. The Tren Urbano has received less ridership than was originally projected and has not significantly reduced the city's automobile traffic, despite a reported 7.5% ridership increase in 2006 over 2005. There is a planned project to build an "interurban light rail system" connecting the cities of [[San Juan-Caguas Rail|San Juan and Caguas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2004/vol8n15/CBCaguasSanJuan.html |title=Caguas To San Juan In 15 Minutes |publisher=Puerto Rico Herald |year=2007 |access-date=2007-05-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203704/http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2004/vol8n15/CBCaguasSanJuan.html |archive-date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref>

Increased investment in public transportation, however, has not changed the fact that San Juan is an [[Automobile dependency|automobile-reliant]] city and its fast growth has sparked [[urban sprawl]]. As of mid-2010, the government has approved plans for a redesign of this Puerto Rican city, featuring a new [[mass transit]] system, new roads and intersections, and more beach-access points. [[Road space rationing|No cars]] will be allowed inside the oldest part of city (Old San Juan). The plans hope to remedy previous poor urban planning in the oldest section of the city, the Isleta, while curbing reliance on motor vehicles. The plans for redevelopment also hope to make the city more appealing in order to attract new residents, as San Juan has suffered from a shrinking population over the past 60 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/sanjuannews/docs/finalreportsummary_walkablecity_july3-final|title=Walkable City San Juan|publisher=Issuu|year=2010|access-date=2010-08-10|archive-date=October 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201003180221/https://issuu.com/sanjuannews/docs/finalreportsummary_walkablecity_july3-final|url-status=live}}</ref>
