In 58 BC a battle took place west of Mulhouse and opposed the Roman army of [[Julius Caesar]] by a coalition of Germanic people led by [[Ariovistus]]. The first written records of the town date from the twelfth century. It was part of the southern Alsatian county of [[Sundgau]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. From 1354 to 1515, Mulhouse was part of the [[Zehnstädtebund]], an association of ten [[Free Imperial Cities]] in Alsace. The city joined the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederation]] as an associate in 1515 and was therefore not annexed by France in the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648 like the rest of the Sundgau. An enclave in Alsace, it was a free and independent [[Calvinist]] republic, known as ''Stadtrepublik Mülhausen'', associated with the Swiss Confederation until, after a vote by its citizens on 4 January 1798, it became a part of France in the [[Treaty of Mulhouse]] signed on 28 January 1798, during the [[French Directory|Directory]] period of the [[French Revolution]].

Starting in the middle of the eighteenth century, the [[Koechlin family]] pioneered cotton cloth manufacturing; Mulhouse became one of France's leading textile centers in the nineteenth century. André Koechlin (1789–1875) built machinery and started making railroad equipment in 1842. The firm in 1839 already employed 1,800 people. It was one of the six large French locomotive constructors until the merger with [[Elsässische Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Grafenstaden]] in 1872, when the company became [[Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques]].<ref>Michael Stephen Smith, ''The emergence of modern business enterprise in France, 1800–1930'' (2006) p. 575.</ref>

After the Prussian victory in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–1871), Mulhouse was annexed to the [[German Empire]] as part of the territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] (1871–1918). The city was briefly occupied by French troops on 8 August 1914 at the start of [[World War I]], but they were forced to withdraw two days later in the [[Battle of Mulhouse]]. French forces then reoccupied the city again on 19 August, before retreating again on 28 August having suffered heavy casualties. Alsatians who celebrated the appearance of the French army were left to face German reprisals, with several citizens sentenced to death. After World War I ended in 1918, French troops entered Alsace, and Germany ceded the region to France under the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. After the [[Battle of France]] in 1940, it was occupied by German forces until its return to French control at the end of [[World War II]] in May 1945.

The town's development was stimulated first by the expansion of the [[textile industry]] and [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]], and subsequently by [[chemical industry|chemical]] and Engineering industries from the mid 18th century. Mulhouse was for a long time called the French [[Manchester]]. Consequently, the town has enduring links with [[Louisiana]], from which it imported cotton, and also with the [[Levant]]. The town's history also explains why its centre is relatively small.

==Geography==
Two rivers run through Mulhouse, the [[Doller (river)|Doller]] and the [[Ill (France)|Ill]], both tributaries of the [[Rhine]]. Mulhouse is approximately {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} from [[Strasbourg]] and [[Zürich]]; it is {{convert|350|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Milan]] and about {{convert|340|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Frankfurt]]. It is close to [[Basel, Switzerland]] and [[Freiburg]], Germany. It shares the [[EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg|EuroAirport]] international airport with these two cities.<ref name="Mulhouse Geography">{{cite web|title=Mulhouse|url=http://www.tourisme-mulhouse.com/en/mulhouse.html|publisher=Tourist Office****and Conventional Bureau of Mulhouse and its Region|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904181740/http://www.tourisme-mulhouse.com/en/mulhouse.html|archive-date=4 September 2013}}</ref>

===Districts===
Medieval Mulhouse consists essentially of a lower and an upper town.
*The lower town was formerly the inner city district of merchants and craftsmen. It developed around the Place de la Réunion (which commemorates its reunion with France). Nowadays this area is pedestrianised.
*The upper town developed from the eighteenth century on. Previously, several [[monastic order]]s were established there, notably the [[Franciscan]]s, [[Augustinians]], [[Poor Clares]] and [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]].
*The ''Nouveau Quartier'' (New District) is the best example of [[urban planning]] in Mulhouse, and was developed from 1826 on, after the [[town wall]]s had been torn down (as they were in many towns in France). It is focused around the ''Place de la République''. Its network of streets and its triangular shape are a good demonstration of the town's desire for a planned layout. The planning was undertaken by the architects [[G. Stolz]] and [[Félix Fries]]. This inner city district was occupied by rich families and the owners of local industries, who tended to be liberal and republican in their opinions.
*The Rebberg district consists of grand houses inspired by the colonnaded residences of Louisiana cotton planters. Originally, this was the town's [[vineyard]] (the word ''Rebe'' meaning ''[[vine]]'' in German). The houses here were built as [[Terraced house|terrace]]s in the English style, a result of the town's close relationship with [[Manchester]], where the sons of industrialists were often sent to study.

===Climate===
Mulhouse's climate is [[temperate climate|temperate]] [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: Cfb), but its location further away from the ocean gives the city colder winters with some snow, and often hot and humid summers, in comparison with the rest of France.
