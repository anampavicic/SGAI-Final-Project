==History==
{{Main|Sahiwal District}}
Following the [[Umayyad dynasty|Ummayad Arab]] conquest of the Punjab cities of Uch and Multan, led by Muhammad bin Qasim, Arabs of the Emirate of Multan ruled the region of Sahiwal for a few centuries. Then Sahiwal remained part of the Multan province of the Mamluk dynasty. Sahiwal also remained associated with the historic city of Depalpur.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Firishtah |first1=Muḥammad Qāsim Hindū Shāh Astarābādī |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_G1AAAAIAAJ&q=history+of+hindustan+by+firishta |title=The History of Hindostan: Translated from the Persian ... |last2=Dow |first2=Alexander |date=1812 |publisher=J. Walker |language=en}}</ref>

The modern-day city of Sahiwal was founded in 1865 when a train station was built at the site of a small village on the [[Punjab Railway|Karachi-Lahore railway line]]. The site was named Montgomery for [[Sir Robert Montgomery]], then lieutenant governor of the Punjab and it replaced [[Gogera]] as the capital of the recently created Montgomery district.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V17_416.gif |title=Montgomery District, Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 17, p. 410., 1860–1922 |publisher=Dsal.uchicago.edu |access-date=2013-02-18}}</ref> Two years later in 1867, it was constituted a municipality.<ref name="Sahiwal">{{cite web |title=Sahiwal |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Sahiwal |website=www.britannica.com |access-date=17 January 2021}}</ref>

In 1914 construction began of the [[Lower Bari Doab Canal]] which now irrigates both the city and the wider region.<ref name="Sahiwal"/>

During the [[Partition of India]] in 1947 the city, being part of Montgomery district, was allocated to Pakistan by the [[Radcliffe Line|Punjab Boundary Commission]]. This was on the basis of being a Muslim-majority area, despite claims from the [[Indian National Congress]] and Sikh groups on the basis of greater property ownership and revenues paid to the state.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ranjan |first1=Amit |title=Partition of India Postcolonial Legacies |date=20 November 2018 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=9780429750526}}</ref>
