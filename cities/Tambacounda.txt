==History==
Tambacounda was founded by [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] settlers of the Jatta (Diatta) family who had been driven out of the valley of the [[Faleme river]] by an expanding [[Bundu (state)|Bundu]] in the 18th century. When they arrived at the future side of Tambacounda they found a single hut, inhabited by a slave named Tamba, who welcomed them, and named the community after him.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Galloway |first=Winifred |date=1975 |title=A History of Wuli from the Thirteenth to the Nineteenth Century |url= |type=History PhD |chapter= |publisher=University of Indiana |docket= |oclc= |access-date=|page=112}}</ref><ref name=Gomez>{{cite book |last1=Gomez |first1=Michael |title=Pragmatism in the Age of Jihad: The Precolonial State of Bundu |date=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=UK |isbn=9780521528474 |edition=2nd}}</ref>{{rp|142}} The town, a center of the [[peanut]] trade with the English, was attacked by Bundu in 1863.<ref name=Gomez/>{{rp|140}}

The [[Kingdom of Wuli]] became a French protectorate in 1888.{{sfn|Traore|2021|pp=307}} The [[Dakar–Niger Railway|Dakar–Bamako railway]] reached Tambacounda in 1913.{{sfn|Traore|2021|pp=311}} In 1919, it became the administrative capital of a new eponymous ''cercle''.{{sfn|Traore|2021|pp=309}} With access to the railroad, in the 1920s came more intensive cultivation of grains, peanuts and cotton.  French colonial authorities made the town a major [[transport hub]], and a number of buildings, including the rail station retain the colonial flavor.

The train ran until 2018, when it was forced out of service due to a lack of maintenance of the rails. As of January 2024, however, major upgrades are being done, with plans to relaunch passenger and freight service between Tambacounda and [[Dakar]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Tambacounda : Relance du chemin de fer/ Un train a enfin sifflé à la gare ferroviaire |url=https://echoriental.com/tambacounda-relance-du-chemin-de-fer-un-train-a-enfin-siffle-a-la-gare-ferroviaire/ |access-date=1 March 2024 |work=Echo Oriental}}</ref>

==Population and culture==

Between the censuses of 1988 and 2002, Tambacounda grew from 41,885 to 67,543 inhabitants. In 2007, according to official estimates, the population reached 78,800 persons.

Settled first by [[Mandinka people]], on the regular [[transhumance]] routes of [[Fula people|Fula]] [[Fulani herdsmen|cattle herders]], and settled again by [[Wolof people|Wolof]] farmers in the early 20th century, Tambacounda has a mix of most of the [[Languages of Senegal|ethnic groups in Senegal]].

The Tambacounda region is famous for its rich [[djembe]] and dance culture and heritage with some of the greatest djembe masters from [[Segu, Mali]] coming to Tambacounda in the mid 1900s, and brought with them their history, knowledge, and secrets of the djembe. Among the famous musicians from Tambacounda was drummer [[Abdoulaye Diakité]].

==Religion==
As with most of Senegal, the population is overwhelmingly [[Islam in Senegal|Muslim]], with much of the Wolof population in the region tracing their roots to [[Mouride]] [[sufi]] adherents who were given wild grassland by [[Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal|the brotherhood]] to clear and settle at the beginning of the 20th century.  There is a [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tambacounda]], but only 1.8% of the population of the region is [[Roman Catholic]].

==Transport==
[[File:Train station, 2009.jpg|thumb|Train station, 2009]]
Besides the [[Dakar–Niger Railway|Dakar–Bamako railway]], historically the city's major engine of growth, Tambacounda lies on the [[N1 road (Senegal)|N1]] and [[N7 road (Senegal)|N7 road]]s. As a part of the [[Trans-Sahelian Highway]] system, these are critical for traffic going between the [[Kayes Region]] of [[Mali]] and the coastal regions of [[Sénégal]] ([[Dakar]], [[Thiès]], [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]]), the most densely populated parts of both these nations. This east–west travel intersects with Senegal's most important route from [[Dakar]] to the [[Casamance]] region, which is cut off by [[Gambia]]. The road through Tambacounda is the only internal route between the two parts of the country that does not cross the Gambian border.

The town also has an airport, [[Tambacounda Airport]], serviced by national and international flights.
[[Image:TambacoundaCows.jpg|thumb|left|240px|A farm near Tambacounda.]]

==Agriculture==
Tambacounda is also a center for agricultural processing, with millet, sorgum, maize and cotton grown in the dry plains of the region. Sodefitex operates a large cotton processing plant in the town.

==Administration==
Tambacounda is the capital of [[Tambacounda Department]] (which includes three administrative regions) and the large [[Tambacounda Region]].

==Sites of interest==
[[File:River gambia Niokolokoba National Park.gif|thumb|[[Niokolo-Koba National Park]]]]
The [[Niokolo-Koba National Park]] lies just to the south of the town, and is famed for its wildlife.

In 2003, the iron-framed rail station, the ''Hôtel de la Gare,'' and the colonial Préfecture building were placed on Senegal's list of ''Monuments historiques''.<ref>[http://www.culture.gouv.sn/article.php3?id_article=137 Arrêté du 27 mars 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207094223/http://www.culture.gouv.sn/article.php3?id_article=137 |date=2012-02-07 }}</ref>
