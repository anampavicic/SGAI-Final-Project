==History==
[[File:Ufo-ji Temple and Junkai-machi street.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Nishio Castle]] [[Jōkamachi]] (Junkaimachi Town)]]

===Origin===
The Mikawa area has been inhabited since prehistoric times, as attested by finds of pottery shards from the [[Jōmon period]] and the megalithic [[Kofun]] tomb in Kira, the oldest in the [[Mikawa Province]].

===Ancient history===
The fertile plains along the [[Yahagi River]] have been used for rice-farming as well as the production of tea and cotton since ancient times.
[[Midden|Shell mounds]] dating to the late [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period which have been found in what is today the town center also point to fish and seafood as important early local produce.

In Hazu, a shrine from the [[Nara period]] is evidence of an early cultural connection to the Japanese capital at the time.
The soil around Nishio is rich in [[mica]] deposits, which was already mined in the Nara period.

===Early modern period===
During the 15th century [[Sengoku period]], Nishio was the home territory for the [[Sakai clan]], based at [[Nishio Castle]].
The area eventually came under the control of the [[Tokugawa clan]], and during the [[Edo period]], most of the area was ruled as the [[Nishio Domain]], a minor ''[[fudai]]'' [[han (administrative division)|feudal domain]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].
The area prospered as a fishing port, and due to its location on the [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]] highway connecting [[Edo]] with [[Kyoto]], although the town itself suffered heavy damage due to a [[tsunami]] in the [[1707 Hōei earthquake]].

===Late modern period===
Early in the [[Meiji period]], with the establishment of the modern municipalities system, Nishio was proclaimed a village in [[Hazu District, Aichi|Hazu District]] in 1871.
Following the [[1891 Mino–Owari earthquake]], a tsunami killed over 60 people. Nishio was elevated to town status on May 1, 1906.
The town suffered damage in the [[1944 Tōnankai earthquake]], which killed 32 people, and the [[1945 Mikawa earthquake]], which killed 765.

===Contemporary history===
After the end of World War II, Nishio attracted many workers from the rural south of Japan and its population increased. In 1953, Nishio became a city with the annexation of neighboring Heisaka and Terazu towns and Fukuchi and Muroba villages; followed by Miwa and Meiji villages in 1955. In 1959, [[Typhoon Vera]] caused considerable damage to the area, with 20 people killed.

On April 1, 2011, the towns of [[Hazu, Aichi|Hazu]], [[Isshiki, Aichi|Isshiki]] and [[Kira, Aichi|Kira]] (all from [[Hazu District, Aichi|Hazu District]]) were merged into Nishio. Hazu District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

==Government==
[[File:Nishio-City-Office-1-.jpg|thumb|200px|Nishio city Hall]]
Nishio has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 30 members. The city contributes two members to the Aichi Prefectural Assembly.  In terms of national politics, the city is part of Aichi District 12 of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Public services==
===Administration===
Nishio's City Hall is located in Chodacho, about half a mile to the south-east of Nishio Station. Its foreign residents section offers assistance in Chinese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and English.

===Garbage disposal===
The Clean Center recycling plant in Kenjoda accepts all kinds of garbage, including bulky items and hazardous waste.

===Health care===
Nishio's main hospital is the Nishio Municipal Hospital in central Nishio, near Yatsuomote-yama.

==Local attractions==
Nishio's sightseeing highlight is Ushitora Yagura Castle Keep in the downtown Yamashita-cho area. It features a full reconstruction of the wooden central tower, gates and central compound of [[Nishio Castle]], built by the [[Matsudaira clan]] in 1221 and used until 1601.

[[Yatsuomote ware]] is a type of [[Japanese pottery]] started around 1825 by Katō Hachiemon (加藤八右衛門) when he opened his [[kiln]] at the southern foot of Mount Yatsuomote (八ツ面山). The soil around Nishio is rich in [[mica]] deposits, which was already mined in the [[Nara period]]. After an incident at Mount Yatsuomote a small bell was offered to soothe the ''[[kami]]''. Katō Kumazō started a local tradition where small ceramic [[zodiac]] [[bell]]s (きらら鈴) were made out of local mica kneaded into the [[clay]], and after burning in the kiln the bell would make a pleasing sound when rung.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pref.aichi.jp/sangyoshinko/densan/416.html|title=きらら鈴 &#124; 愛知県|website=Pref.aichi.jp|access-date=December 1, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotobank.jp/word/%E3%81%8D%E3%82%89%E3%82%89%E9%88%B4-2101932|title=きらら鈴とは|website=Kotobank.jp|access-date=December 1, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nishio.mypl.net/article/neta-fresh_nishio/32014|title=「きらら鈴」を受け継ごうとする"お母さん"たちがいます &#124; 旬な地元ネタ!!&#124; まいぷれ[西尾・碧南・高浜]|website=Nishio.mypl.net|access-date=December 1, 2021}}</ref>
