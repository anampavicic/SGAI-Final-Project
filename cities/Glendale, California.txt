Glendale lies in the Verdugo Mountains, and is a [[suburb]] in the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]]. The city is bordered to the northwest by the [[Shadow Hills, Los Angeles|Shadow Hills]] and [[Tujunga, Los Angeles, California|Tujunga]] neighborhoods of Los Angeles; to the northeast by [[La Cañada Flintridge, California|La Cañada Flintridge]] and the unincorporated area of [[La Crescenta, California|La Crescenta]]; to the west by [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] and [[Griffith Park]]; to the east by [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles|Eagle Rock]] and [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]; to the south by the [[Atwater Village, Los Angeles|Atwater Village]] neighborhood of Los Angeles; and to the southeast by [[Glassell Park, Los Angeles|Glassell Park]] neighborhood of Los Angeles. The [[Interstate 5 in California|Golden State]], [[Ventura Freeway|Ventura]], [[Glendale Freeway|Glendale]], and [[Foothill Freeway|Foothill]] freeways run through the city.

==History==
===Spanish rule===
In 1798, [[Jose Maria Verdugo|José María Verdugo]], a [[corporal]] in the Spanish army from [[Baja California Peninsula|Baja California]], received the [[Rancho San Rafael]] from Governor [[Diego de Borica]], formalizing his possession and use of land on which he had been grazing livestock and farming since 1784. Rancho San Rafael was a Spanish concession, of which 25 were made in California. Unlike the later Mexican land grants, the concessions were similar to grazing permits, with the title remaining with the Spanish crown.<ref>Beck, Warren A., Haase, Ynez D. (1974). ''Historical Atlas of California''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press.</ref>
[[File:Catalina Verdugo Adobe.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Catalina Verdugo Adobe]] is the city's oldest building. It was built on [[Rancho San Rafael]], granted to [[José María Verdugo]] in 1784, which included all of modern-day Glendale.]]

===Mexican rule===
[[New Spain]] achieved its independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821, and from 1824, Rancho San Rafael existed within the new [[First Mexican Republic|Mexican Republic]].

===1847 to present===
Mexican rule ended during the Mexican–American War: Americans took control from the [[Californios]] after a series of battles, culminating with the signing of the [[Treaty of Cahuenga]] on January 13, 1847.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Guinn |first=James Miller |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KyFPAAAAYAAJ |title=Historical and biographical record of southern California: containing a history of southern California from its earliest settlement to the opening year of the twentieth century |publisher=Chapman pub. co. |year=1902 |page=50 |access-date=September 30, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230318040525/https://books.google.com/books?id=KyFPAAAAYAAJ |archive-date=March 18, 2023 |url-status=live}}</ref> With the [[Mexican Cession|cession]] of California to the United States following the [[Mexican–American War]], the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] provided that the land grants would be honored.

In 1860, José María Verdugo's grandson [[Jose Maria Verdugo#Julio Verdugo|Teodoro Verdugo]] built the [[Catalina Verdugo Adobe]], which is the oldest building in Glendale. The property is the location of the Oak of Peace, where early [[Californio]] leaders including [[Pio Pico]] met in 1847 and decided to surrender to [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[John C. Frémont]].
[[File:Glendale-1870s.jpg|thumb|left|View of Glendale in the 1870s]]
Verdugo's descendants sold the ranch in various parcels, some of which are included in present-day [[Atwater Village, Los Angeles, California|Atwater Village]], [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, California|Eagle Rock]], and [[Highland Park, Los Angeles, California|Highland Park]] neighborhoods of Los Angeles.

In 1883, soon after [[Atwater Village]] was settled, the [[Atwater Tract Office]] brought train service to the area.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Creason |first=Glen |date=June 18, 2021 |title=The Secret, Sordid History Of Threemile House, A Den Of Iniquity On The Edge Of 1890s LA |url=https://laist.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/the-secret-sordid-history-of-threemile-house-a-den-of-iniquity-on-the-edge-of-1890s-la |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221025185638/https://laist.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/the-secret-sordid-history-of-threemile-house-a-den-of-iniquity-on-the-edge-of-1890s-la |archive-date=October 25, 2022 |access-date=December 9, 2021 |agency=LAist}}</ref> In 1884, residents gathered to form a townsite and chose the name "Glendale".

[[File:Glendale-Brand-1915.jpg|thumb|left|Brand Street in Glendale – a [[Glendale–Burbank Line]] streetcar stops to pick up and drop off passengers in 1915.]]

An important civic [[wikt:booster|booster]] of the era was [[Leslie Coombs Brand]] (1859–1925), who built an estate in 1904 called El Miradero, featuring an eye-catching mansion, the architecture of which combined characteristics of Spanish, Moorish, and Indian styles, copied from the East Indian Pavilion at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] held in Chicago, which he visited.

Brand partnered with [[Henry E. Huntington]] to bring the [[Pacific Electric]] Railway, or the "Red Cars", to the area. The [[Glendale–Burbank Line]], which was operational from 1904 to 1955, ran from [[Downtown Los Angeles]] to [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] via Glendale. The dual-track streetcars entered the Glendale city limit by crossing San Fernando Road, and the line continued northerly in the pavement of Brand Boulevard, crossing Los Feliz Boulevard, Chevy Chase Boulevard, Colorado Boulevard, Broadway and Lexington Drive. The main line continued north to Verdugo Wash where the line became a single track. At Arden Junction at Glenoaks Boulevard, the line branched. The old main line continued north in the pavement of Brand Boulevard to a terminus in North Glendale at Mountain Avenue. The Burbank Line diverged westerly as a single-track line on private way in the center of Glenoaks Boulevard, then continued westerly past Central, Pacific, Highland, Western, and Alameda Avenues to a terminus in Burbank at Cypress Avenue.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Glendale-Burbank Line |url=http://www.erha.org/pewgb.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114163234/http://www.erha.org/pewgb.htm |archive-date=January 14, 2009 |access-date=October 25, 2022}}</ref>

Brand loved to fly, and built a private airstrip in 1919 and hosted "fly-in" parties, providing a direct link to the soon-to-be-built nearby [[Grand Central Airport (United States)|Grand Central Airport]]. The grounds of El Miradero are now city-owned Brand Park and the mansion is the Brand Library, according to the terms of his will.<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 28, 2010 |title=The Brand legacy, Mansion and Library |url=http://www.brandlibrary.org/brand_history.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206190412/http://brandlibrary.org/brand_history.asp |archive-date=December 6, 2010 |access-date=January 29, 2011 |publisher=Brandlibrary.org}}</ref>

The Forest Lawn Cemetery opened in 1906 and was renamed [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial-Park]]<ref>Kath, Laura. Forest Lawn: The first 100 years, Tropico Press, 2006</ref> in 1917. Pioneering [[endocrinology|endocrinologist]] and entrepreneur [[Henry Harrower|Henry R. Harrower]] opened his clinic in Glendale in 1920, which for many years was the largest business in the city.

In 1922, the Atwater Tract Office was demolished, and construction began on the [[Glendale Transportation Center]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Glendale, CA (GDL) |url=https://www.greatamericanstations.com/stations/glendale-ca-gdl/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221025185639/https://www.greatamericanstations.com/stations/glendale-ca-gdl/ |archive-date=October 25, 2022 |access-date=October 25, 2022}}</ref>

[[File:Old Flag of Glendale, California.gif|thumb|Old flag of Glendale]]

The city flag was adopted by Glendale on September 18, 1924, and was designed by Hugh A. Maron, who also won $100 for designing it. The flag was then changed to the current one (seen above) in 2001.

The American Green Cross, an early [[Conservation ethic|conservation]] and tree preservation society, was formed in 1926 (it disbanded three years later and the current organization of that name is unrelated).
[[File:GlendaleHotel2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|The historic [[Hotel Glendale]] was built in the 1920s.]]
[[Grand Central Airport (California)|Grand Central Airport]] was the departure point for the first commercial west-to-east transcontinental flight flown by [[Charles Lindbergh]].

===Sundown town status===
Until as late as the 1960s, Glendale was a [[sundown town]].

===Geology===
Several known earthquake faults criss-cross the Glendale area and adjacent mountains, as in much of Southern California. Among the more recognized faults are the Sierra Madre and Hollywood faults, situated in the city's northern and southwestern portions, respectively. Additionally, the Verdugo and Raymond faults intersect through the city's central and southeastern areas. The San Gabriel fault, meanwhile, is located northeast of the city. Roughly {{convert|75|mi|km}} northeast of Glendale is a major portion of the [[San Andreas Fault]] known as the "Big Bend", where quake-recurrence tracking shows major activity roughly every 140–160 years. The closest portion of the San Andreas is actually {{convert|29|mi|km}} from Glendale. The last major quake along the southern San Andreas was recorded in 1857.
[[File:Forest Lawn and Verdugo Mountains.jpg|thumb|right|[[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] and the [[Verdugo Mountains]]]]
In the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake]], which took place along the western edge of the Sierra Madre Fault, surface ruptures were nearly {{convert|12|mi|km}} long, including one portion a few miles northwest of Glendale. Most of the damage was in the northern San Fernando Valley, though 31 structures in Glendale suffered major damage and had to be demolished, plus numerous chimneys collapsed. The [[1994 Northridge earthquake]] had an epicenter about {{convert|18|mi|km}} from Glendale. The city suffered severe damage to a public parking structure and sections of the [[Glendale Galleria]] parking structures and exterior columns incurred damages.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110717013745/http://www.ci.glendale.ca.us/pdf/HMP/HMP_Sec-6_Earthquakes.pdf Ci.glendale.ca] City of Glendale report</ref>

===Climate===
Glendale has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Csa''), with hot summers and mild winters with occasional rainfall. The highest recorded temperature in Glendale was {{convert|115|°F|°C}} on September 6, 2020. The lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|17|°F|°C}} on February 15, 1990. The warmest month is August and the coolest month is January.

The annual average precipitation is just over {{convert|21|in|mm}}, mostly falling between November and April. Rainfall totals are highly variable from year to year, with the wettest years (sometimes over {{convert|30|in|mm}} of rainfall) usually associated with warm [[El Niño]] conditions, and the drier years (sometimes under {{convert|10|in|mm}} of rainfall) with cool [[La Niña]] episodes in the Pacific.

The hills and mountains of northern Glendale very rarely have snow, owing to its warmer temperatures during the winter. It may only occur about every five to ten years. The last time it snowed was February 26, 2011, in which snow accumulation of approximately {{convert|3|in|cm}} occurred and sleet was present. Frost sometimes occurs at night from late November to early March. Heavy rains and thunderstorms are also common during the winter. The spring brings temperate weather, with little rain. The summer is usually fairly warm, with highs from {{convert|85|°F|°C}}, to the low 100s (40&nbsp;°C). Summer is usually very dry, but thunderstorms can come from Arizona, bringing high humidity into the area. These rare days cause heat indices over {{convert|120|°F|°C}}. Fall often brings clear and dry weather, but can be gusty due to the Santa Ana winds, blowing in once or twice a year from October to December. Santa Ana winds can reach up to {{convert|70|mph|km/h}}, with gusts up to {{convert|100|mph|km/h}} in mountain passes and canyons. Thunderstorms occur very rarely and they are accompanied by gusty winds and hail.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Forecasts |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/91205 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181128210904/https://weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/91205 |archive-date=November 28, 2018 |access-date=December 1, 2018}}</ref>

Armenian families have lived in the city since the 1920s, but the surge in immigration escalated in the 1970s. Armenian Americans are well integrated into the city, with many businesses, several Armenian schools, and ethnic/cultural organizations serving this ethnic group.

[[Grand Central Airport (California)|Grand Central Airport]] was a municipal airport developed from 1923 which became the largest employer in Glendale for many years, and contributed to the development of aviation in the United States in many important ways. The main terminal building still stands and includes both Art Deco and Spanish-style architectural elements. The facility was the first official terminal for the Los Angeles area, as well as the departure point for the first commercial west-to-east transcontinental flight flown by [[Charles Lindbergh]]. During [[World War II]], the Grand Central Air Terminal building was camouflaged to protect it from enemy targeting. It was closed down in 1959, and made way for the Grand Central Business Centre, an [[industrial park]].

Forest Lawn Memorial Park started in Tropico (later annexed to Glendale) in 1906 and is famous for its art collection and the burial of many celebrities, as well as for the 1933 opening of the first funeral home on cemetery grounds anywhere in the United States.<ref>Kath, Laura, Forest Lawn: The first 100 years, Tropico Press, 2006</ref> The [[Bob's Big Boy]] chain of [[hamburger]] restaurants started in Glendale on East Colorado in August 1936, and the [[Baskin-Robbins]] "31 Flavors" chain of [[ice cream]] parlors started in Adams Square in 1945.

The city experienced significant development in the 1970s, with the completion of the [[Glendale Freeway|Glendale Freeway (Highway 2)]] and the [[Ventura Freeway|Ventura Freeway (Highway 134)]]. This included redevelopment of Brand Boulevard, renovation of the 1925 [[Alex Theatre]], and construction of the [[Glendale Galleria]] shopping mall which opened in 1976, and was further expanded in 1982.

Several large companies have offices in Glendale including the U.S. headquarters of [[IHOP (restaurant)|International House of Pancakes]]. The Los Angeles regional office of California's [[State Compensation Insurance Fund]] is in Glendale. Americas United Bank was founded in Glendale in 2006 and is still headquartered there. In August 2013, [[Avery Dennison]] Corp., a label maker for major brands, announced plans to move its headquarters from [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] to Glendale.<ref>{{Cite web |date=August 3, 2013 |title=Avery Dennison moving its headquarters from Pasadena to Glendale |url=http://www.dailynews.com/breakingnews/ci_23779793/avery-dennison-moving-its-headquarters-from-pasadena-glendale |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130802045328/http://www.dailynews.com/breakingnews/ci_23779793/avery-dennison-moving-its-headquarters-from-pasadena-glendale |archive-date=August 2, 2013 |website=Los Angeles Daily News}}</ref> Avery employs about 26,000 people.

Caruso had previously designed and built [[the Grove at Farmers Market]].
