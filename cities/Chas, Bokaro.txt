'''Chas (literally চাষ - खेती - Cultivation)''' is a [[Municipal Corporation]] in the [[Chas subdivision]] of the [[Bokaro district]] in the state of [[Jharkhand]], India. It is often referred to as a suburb of [[Bokaro Steel City]], though it predates the steel plant.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bokaro|first=District Administration|date=2020|title=Chas Municipal Corporation|url=https://bokaro.nic.in/chas-municipal-corporation/}}</ref> Chas is one of the fastest-growing urban regions in Jharkhand and was ranked as the cleanest locality of Eastern India and the 19th cleanest locality of India in 2018, according to [[Swachh Survekshan]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Chas retains its swachh glory|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/chas-retains-its-swachh-glory/cid/1372143|access-date=2020-11-06|website=www.telegraphindia.com}}</ref>

==History==
Once a small grain trading hub of the region, Chas became notable during the [[World War II|Second World War]] when the British government used it as a base to supply soldiers fighting in the [[Burma Campaign|eastern front]] against the Japanese. In the 1960s, the Government of India decided to establish the [[Bokaro Steel Plant]] nearby, which enhanced the economic activity of the region.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bokaro|first=District Administration|date=2020|title=District Bokaro > History|url=https://bokaro.nic.in/history/}}</ref>
