'''Acre''' ({{IPA|pt|ˈakɾi|lang|Pt-br_Acre.ogg}}) is a state located in the west of the [[North Region, Brazil|North Region]] of [[Brazil]] and the [[Amazonia Legal]]. Located in the westernmost part of the country, at a two-hour [[Time in Brazil|time difference]] from [[Brasília]], Acre is bordered clockwise by the Brazilian states of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]] and [[Rondônia]] to the north and east, along with an [[Brazil–Peru border|international border]] with the [[Bolivia]]n [[Departments of Bolivia|department]] of [[Pando Department|Pando]] to the southeast, and the [[Peru]]vian [[Regions of Peru|regions]] of [[Madre de Dios Region|Madre de Dios]], [[Ucayali Region|Ucayali]] and [[Loreto Region|Loreto]] to the south and west. Its capital and largest city is [[Rio Branco, Acre|Rio Branco]]. Other important places include [[Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre|Cruzeiro do Sul]], [[Sena Madureira]], [[Tarauacá]] and [[Feijó, Acre|Feijó]]. The state, which has 0.42% of the Brazilian population, generates 0.2% of the Brazilian [[GDP]].<ref>[https://g1.globo.com/ac/acre/noticia/2020/11/18/pib-do-acre-teve-segunda-pior-variacao-do-pais-em-2018-diz-ibge.ghtml PIB do Acre teve segunda pior variação do país em 2018, diz IBGE]</ref>

Intense extractive activity in the rubber industry, which reached its height in the early 20th century, attracted Brazilians from many regions to the state. From the mixture of [[South Region, Brazil|sulista]], [[Southeast Region, Brazil|southeastern Brazil]], [[Northeast Region, Brazil|nordestino]], and [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] traditions arose a diverse cuisine. It combines sun-dried meat ([[carne-de-sol]]) with [[Arapaima|pirarucu]], a typical fish of the region. Such dishes are seasoned with [[tucupi]], a sauce made from [[manioc]].

[[Maritime transport|Fluvial transport]], concentrated on the [[Juruá River|Juruá]] and [[Moa River (Brazil)|Moa]] rivers, in the western part of the state, and the [[Tarauacá River|Tarauacá]] and [[Envira River|Envira]] rivers in the northwest, is the principal form of transportation, especially between November and June. Heavy seasonal rains frequently make the [[BR-364]] impassable in those months; it usually connects Rio Branco to Cruzeiro do Sul.

==Etymology==
The name, which was given to the territory in 1904, and to the state in 1962, is derived from one of the local rivers, perhaps originates from the [[Tupian languages|Tupi]] word ''a'kir ü'' "green river", or from the form ''a'kir'', of the Tupi word ''ker'', "to sleep, to rest". It is believed more likely to be derived from ''Aquiri'', a transliteration by European explorers of the term ''Umákürü'', or ''Uakiry'', from the Ipurinã dialect. Another hypothesis is that Acquiri derives from ''Yasi'ri'', or ''Ysi'ri'', meaning "flowing or swift water".

According to one account, agriculturist João Gabriel de Carvalho Melo wrote during an 1878 trip on the [[Purús River]] to merchant Viscount of Santo Elias (from Pará), asking him for goods to be sent to the "mouth of the Aquiri River". In [[Belém]], the local merchant or his employees either misinterpreted Gabriel's handwriting, or he spelled the name wrong: the goods and invoice which Gabriel received were marked as having been sent to the [[Acre River]].

Acre possesses some nicknames: the End of Brazil, The Rubber Tree State, the Latex State (from when it was a center of rubber production) and the Western End.

The native inhabitants of Acre are called ''acr'''i'''ano'''s''''', in the singular ''acr'''i'''an'''o'''''. Until the entry according to the [[Orthographic Agreement of 1990]], the correct spelling was ''acr'''e'''an'''o''''' in the [[grammatical number|singular]] and in the plural ''acr'''e'''ano'''s'''''. In 2009, with the new orthographic agreement, the change generated controversy between the Academy of Letters of Acre (Academia Acreana de Letras) and the Brazilian Academy of Letters ([[Academia Brasileira de Letras]]). The latter said that the change would mean the denial of the state's historical and cultural roots, by changing the last letter of the toponym from "[[E]]" to "[[I]]".

==Geography==

[[File:Acre Köppen.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Climate types of Acre]]

The state of Acre occupies an area of {{cvt|152,581|km2}} (58,911&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup>) in the extreme west of Brazil. It is located at [[70th meridian west|70º west]] [[longitude]] and at [[9th parallel south|9º south]] [[latitude]]. In Brazil, the state is part of the [[Northern Region, Brazil|North Region]], forming borders with the states of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]] and [[Rondônia]], and with two countries: [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]].

Practically all of the [[terrain]] of the state of Acre is part of the low [[sandstone]] [[plateau]], or [[terra firme]], [[geomorphology|morphological]] unit which dominates most of the Brazilian [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]]. These [[terranes]] rise, in Acre, from the [[Ordinal direction#Additional points|southeast]] to the [[Ordinal direction#Additional points|northeast]], with very tabular [[topography]] in general. In the extreme west is found the [[Serra da Contamana]] or Serra do Divisor, along the western [[border]], with the highest altitudes in the state ({{convert|609|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=semicolon}}). About 63% of the [[States of Brazil|state]]'s [[Surface area|surface]] lies between {{convert|200|and|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height; 16% between 300 and 609 (984 and 1,998&nbsp;ft); and 21% between 200 and 135 (656 and 443&nbsp;ft).

The [[climate]] is [[Temperature|hot]] and very [[humid]], of the ''Am'' type in the [[Köppen climate classification]] system, and the monthly average [[temperatures]] vary between {{convert|24|and|27|C|F}}, being the lowest average of the North Region. The rainfall reaches an annual total of {{convert|2,100|mm|in|abbr=on}}, with a clear [[dry season]] in the months of June, July, and August.

The [[Amazon Rainforest]] covers all of the state territory. Very rich in [[rubber trees]] of the most valuable species (''Hevea brasiliensis'') and Brazil nut trees (''Bertholletia excelsa''), the forest guarantees that Acre is the greatest national producer of [[rubber]] and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]]. Acre's principal rivers, mostly navigable during the wet season (the [[Juruá]], [[Tarauacá River|Tarauacá]], [[Envira River|Envira]], [[Purús River|Purús]], [[Iaco River|Iaco]], and [[Acre River|Acre]]), cross the state with almost parallel courses which converge only outside of its territory.

The largest recorded [[Black Caiman]], measured at {{convert|7.7|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} and weighing {{convert|1310|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, was shot in Acre in 1965.

The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining [[rainforest]]s and comprises the largest and most species-rich tract of [[tropical rainforest]] in the world. Wet tropical forests are the most species-rich [[biome]], and tropical forests in the Americas are consistently more species-rich than the wet forests in Africa and Asia.<ref name="Turner 2001">Turner, I.M. 2001.

More than 1/3 of all species in the world live in the Amazon Rainforest.<ref>[http://www.worldwildlife.org/wildplaces/amazon/index.cfm Amazon Rainforest, Amazon Plants, Amazon River Animals]</ref>

==Statistical and legal subdivisions==
Acre is divided into twenty-two municipalities, five immediate regions and two intermediate regions:

The region of present-day Acre is thought to have been inhabited by [[Pre-Columbian]] civilizations since at least 2,100 years ago. Evidence includes complex [[geoglyph]]s of this age found in the area. The natives who crafted them are believed to have had a relatively advanced knowledge of this technology. Since at least the early 15th century, the region has been inhabited by peoples who spoke [[Panoan languages]]; their territory was geographically close to that of the [[Inca]].

In the mid-18th century, the region was [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonized by the Spanish]] and became part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. Following the [[Peruvian War of Independence|Peruvian]] and [[Bolivian War of Independence|Bolivian]] wars of independence, which ended in 1826, the region and large portions around it became part of both Peru and Bolivia respectively, but independent of Spain and both states disputed the territory. It was a territory of the short-lived [[Peru–Bolivian Confederation]] (1836–1839), until the two countries separated and most of the region returned to Bolivian control.

The discovery of [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber tree]] groves in the region in the mid-19th century attracted numerous immigrants, especially from Brazil and Europe, seeking to build on the rubber boom. Despite the increased numbers of Brazilians, the [[Treaty of Ayacucho]] (1867) determined that the region belonged to Bolivia. By 1877, Acre's population was composed almost entirely of Brazilians coming from the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]].

In 1899, Brazilian settlers from Acre created an independent state in the region called the [[Republic of Acre]]. Bolivians tried to gain control of the area, but Brazilians revolted and there were border confrontations. This resulted in what was known as the [[Acre War]]. On November 17, 1903, with the signing over and sale in the [[Treaty of Petrópolis]], Brazil received final possession of the region. Acre was integrated into Brazil as a territory divided into three departments. The territory was acquired by Brazil for two million pounds sterling. The land was taken from [[Mato Grosso]] in accordance with terms for the construction of the Madeira-Mamoré railway.

Once the Acre War was over, Peru did not recognize the annexation of Acre until 1909, with the Velarde-Río Branco Treaty, where the borders between Peru and Brazil were defined. It was signed in [[Rio de Janeiro]], on September 8, 1909, by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Brazil, [[José Paranhos, Baron of Rio Branco|Baron of Rio Branco]], and the plenipotentiary minister of Peru in Brazil, Hernán Velarde, by President [[Augusto B. Leguía]] (first government) then ruled in Peru, and in Brazil by the president [[Nilo Pecanha]], in order to solve the border problems between Peru and Brazil.

[[Image:Brazil map 1892.gif|left|thumb|300px|Map of Brazil during ''[[República Velha]]'', 1892. Note the differences from current western borders in the areas of [[Pantanal]] and the [[Amazon basin]] — including the lack of Acre's territory, then still part of [[Bolivia]]]]

Acre was united in 1920. On June 15, 1962, it was elevated to the category of state, and was the first to be governed by a woman, [[Iolanda Fleming]], a teacher.

During the early twentieth century, rubber seedlings were taken to Southeast Asia, where competitive plantations were established, reducing the importance of the Amazon in production. But during the [[Second World War]], Japanese forces took over the rubber tree groves of [[British Malaya|Malaya]].

Acre was called on to produce rubber for the Allied war effort. The [[Rubber Soldiers]], natives mostly of the Ceará plantation, increased production and provided critical supplies to the Allies.

Acre's decisive contribution to the Allied victory may have helped Brazil attract North American investment to form the National Steel Company (Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional) in the postwar era. This company aided in the industrialization of the Central-south, which did not yet possess basic heavy industries.

On April 4, 2008, Acre won a judicial debate with the state of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]] in relation to the dispute surrounding the Cunha Gomes Line. It annexed part of the municipalities of [[Envira]], [[Guajará]], [[Boca do Acre]], [[Pauini]], [[Eirunepé]] and [[Ipixuna]]. The territorial redefinition consolidated the incorporation of 1.2 million hectares of the Liberdade, Gregório, and Mogno forest complex to the territory of Acre, which corresponds to {{cvt|11,583.87|km2}}.

During the 17th century, Portuguese expeditions reached many of the far ends of present-day Brazil. The expansion of the exploration to the west followed, and they reached lands under control by the Spanish colonies. The two nations negotiated to establish their territories, under the Treaties of [[Treaty of Madrid (13 January 1750)|Madrid]] (1750) and [[First Treaty of San Ildefonso|San Ildefonso]] (1777).<ref>Treaty of Madrid [https://historiaaberta.com.sapo.pt/lib/doc016.htm "Tratado de Madri"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411000503/http://historiaaberta.com.sapo.pt/lib/doc016.htm |date=April 11, 2015 }}</ref> Both of the treaties were based on the explorations of Portuguese ''bandeirante'' [[Manoel Félix de Lima]] of the [[Guaporé River|Guaporé]] and [[Madeira River|Madeira]] river basins. The treaties established the riverbeds of the [[Mamoré]] and Guaporé to their maximum western limits on the left bank of the [[Javari]] as the border between the Spanish and Portuguese territories.

The Portuguese created the new royal [[captaincy of Mato Grosso]] (1751), stimulating settlement toward the frontier. New centers developed: [[Vila Bela]] (1752)<ref>FERREIRA, João Carlos Vicente.

Accessed October 5, 2010.</ref> Until the mid-19th century, there was little effort to settle the area systematically. At that time, the great virgin source of rubber attracted commercial interest, and development followed.

The empire was directed towards agricultural exports, based on [[coffee]] as the most important commodity. The territories of the extreme west were unknown and usually overlooked. For example, although [[Cândido Mendes de Almeida]]'s ''Atlas of the Empire of Brazil'' (1868), was considered a model of its time, geographers knew nothing of the Acre River and its principal tributaries, which did not appear at all in the atlas.

Exploitative activities, the industrial importance of the rubber reserves, and the penetration of Brazilian colonists in the region raised the attention of [[Bolivia]], which solicited a better fixation of boundaries. After much failed negotiation, in 1867 the [[Treaty of Ayacucho]] was signed, which recognized the colonial ''[[uti possidetis]]'', or use of that territory by Brazil.<ref>[http://www.grupoescolar.com/materia/o_tratado_de_madrid_e_o_tratado_de_ayacucho.html "O Tratado de Madrid e o Tratado de Ayacucho"] GrupoEscolar.com Page visited on October 6, 2010</ref> A border was established parallel to the confluence of the [[Beni River|Beni]] and [[Mamoré]] rivers, running eastward to the headwaters of the [[Javari River]], even though the source of this river was not yet known.

In the year 1873–1874, in the [[drainage basin]] of the Purús, the population rose from around one thousand to four thousand inhabitants. The Brazilian imperial government, already sensitive to the resulting offerings of [[rubber]], considered the entire valley of the Purús to be Brazilian.

In the second half of the 19th century, disturbances were registered in the demographic and geo-economic balance of the empire. The coffee boom in the south attracted financial resources and workers, to detriment of the northeast.<ref name="FURTADO">FURTADO, Celso.

Distant from the diplomatic process, the rubber workers judged their interests to have been cheated, and initiated insurrection movements. Some of this was in response to brutal treatment and abuse by forces managed by the major rubber companies. In the same year that Bolivia established administration in [[Puerto Alonso]] (1899), two serious uprisings occurred.<ref name="PORTOACRE" />

In April, a [[Ceará|Cearense]] lawyer, José Carvalho, led an armed movement, which culminated in the expulsion of the Bolivian authorities.<ref name="GURGEL" /> Shortly thereafter, Bolivia began negotiations with an Anglo-American trust, the ''Bolivian Syndicate'', in order to promote, with exceptional force (exacting of taxes, armed force), the political and economic incorporation of Acre into its territory.<ref name="GURGEL" /> The governor of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]], [[Ramalho Júnior]], informed of the agreement by a functionary of the Bolivian consulate in [[Belém]], [[Luis Gálvez Rodríguez de Arias]], sent military contingents forward to occupy [[Puerto Alonso]].<ref name="GURGEL" /> Gálvez proclaimed the independence of Acre, in the form of a republic. He became its president with the acquiescence of the rubber gatherers. Under protests from Bolivia, President [[Campos Sales]] abolished the ephemeral republic (March 1900).<ref name="GURGEL" />

At the same time, Brazilians organized a large armed assault on the disputed area.<ref name="GURGEL" /> The operations were led by a former student of the [[Military School of Rio Grande do Sul]] ([[Escola Militar do Rio Grande do Sul]]), [[José Plácido de Castro]]. The rubber gatherers occupied the village of [[Xapuri]] in Alto Acre (August 1902), and took Bolivian officials into custody.<ref name="GURGEL" /> Finally, Plácido de Castro's forces besieged Puerto Alonso, proclaiming the Independent State of Acre, after the capitulation of Bolivian troops (February 1903).<ref name="GURGEL" />

From 1946 on, the federal government undertook actions to revive the economy of the [[Amazon Basin]], and to include it in [[regional development]] projects.

Attending to the judicial arrangements of the [[Treaty of Petrópolis]], President [[Rodrigues Alves]] sanctioned the law which created the Territory of Acre (1904),<ref>[http://www.ac.gov.br/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1712&Itemid=51 "Governador Binho Marques fará revista às tropas da PMAC"].

During the [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]] (New State) political ideas involving the valorization of the interior took hold, with the intention of promoting the articulation of more isolated areas. Thereafter, the vote of 1946 commended the channeling of budgetary resources from the Union to the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]], determining that the [[Territory (administrative division)|Territory]] of Acre would be elevated to the condition of [[States of Brazil|state]] as soon as its revenue reached the equivalent of the lowest state tax exaction.<ref>VIANA, Fernando de Mello (September 18, 1946).
