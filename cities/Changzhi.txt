'''Changzhi''' ({{zh|s=长治}}) is a [[prefecture-level city]] in the southeast of [[Shanxi]] Province, China, bordering the provinces of [[Hebei]] and [[Henan]] to the northeast and east, respectively. Historically, the city was one of the 36 administrative areas (see [[History of the administrative divisions of China before 1912#Provinces under the Qin dynasty|Administrative Divisions of Qin Dynasty]]) extant under the reign of the first emperor of a unified China (see [[Qin Shi Huang]]).

Nowadays, Changzhi is a transportation centre in Shanxi. Transportations is facilitated by: four [[controlled-access highway]]s, ([[Taiyuan]]-Changzhi, Changzhi-[[Jincheng]], Changzhi-[[Linfen]], and Changzhi-[[Handan]]); two railways, ([[Taiyuan–Jiaozuo Railway]] and [[Handan–Changzhi Railway]] ); three [[China National Highways|national highways]], [[China National Highway 207]], [[China National Highway 208|208]] and [[China National Highway 309|309]]; and [[Changzhi Wangcun Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association airport code|ITAT Code]]: CIH, [[International Civil Aviation Organization airport code|ICAO Code]]: ZBCZ). Internal transportation also includes a bus and taxi network.

The city is a rising commercial and industrial centre in the southeastern area of Shanxi. In 2011, its [[GDP]] ranked 1st out of 11 prefecture-level cities in the province.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130407155614/http://czstats.gov.cn/readnewsgb0611.asp?NewsID=2988&BigClassName=%CD%B3%BC%C6%B7%D6%CE%F6&SmallClassName=%BD%F8%B6%C8%B7%D6%CE%F6&SpecialID=0 Statistics Report of Changzhi Economy in 2011 (In Chinese)]</ref> According to the latest census, in 2020 the city was home to 3,180,884 residents whom 1,214,940 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of Luzhou and Shangdang Districts. The other 2 urban districts Tunliu and Lucheng are not conurbated yet.

==History==
In ancient times the area around Changzhi (Including [[Jincheng]]) was known as [[Shangdang]].<ref name=lew2009>Lew, Christopher R. ''The Third Chinese Revolutionary War, 1945-1949: An Analysis of Communist Strategy and Leadership''. The USA and Canada: Routelage. 2009, p.22–23. {{ISBN|0-415-77730-5}}</ref> Changzhi was the site of the 1945 [[Shangdang Campaign]], the first battle between the [[Kuomintang]] and the [[People's Liberation Army]] after the end of [[World War II]]. The campaign began in August 1945 and lasted until October. It began when the local Shanxi warlord, [[Yan Xishan]], attempted to retake the region from Communist forces. Yan's forces were eventually defeated by an army led by [[Liu Bocheng]], who was later named one of China's [[Yuan Shuai#People's Republic of China|Ten Great Marshals]].  Liu's political commissar was [[Deng Xiaoping]], who later became China's "[[paramount leader]]". The campaign ended with the complete destruction of Yan's army ([[Shanxi clique|Jingsui army]], 晋绥军), most of which joined the Communists after surrendering. Following the Shangdang Campaign, the Communists remained in control of the region until they won the [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] in 1949.<ref name=lew2009 />

The area under the control of People's Government of Changzhi City is divided into 12 [[County-level division|county-level administration zone]]. They are 4 districts [[Luzhou District, Changzhi|Luzhou]], [[Lucheng District, Changzhi|Lucheng]], [[Shangdang District|Shangdang]], and [[Tunliu District|Tunliu]]; and 8 counties [[Xiangyuan County]], [[Pingshun County]], [[Licheng County]], [[Huguan County]], [[Zhangzi County]], [[Wuxiang County]], [[Qin County]], and [[Qinyuan County]].
