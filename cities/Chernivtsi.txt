Formerly the capital of the historic region of [[Bukovina]], which is now divided between [[Romania]] and Ukraine, Chernivtsi serves as the administrative center for the [[Chernivtsi Raion]], the [[Chernivtsi urban hromada]],<ref name= reform2020>{{Cite web |script-title=ru:Черновицкая громада |url=https://gromada.info/ru/obschina/chernivci/ |publisher=Портал об'єднаних громад України |language=ru}}</ref> and the [[Chernivtsi Oblast|oblast itself]].

The first document that refers to this city dates back to 1408,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Chernivtsi |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Chernivtsi-Ukraine |access-date=2022-10-18 |website=Encyclopædia Britannica Online}}</ref> when Chernivtsi was a town in the region of [[Moldavia]], formerly as a defensive fortification, and became the center of Bukovina in 1488. In 1538, Chernivtsi was under the control of the [[Principality of Moldavia]] under [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Polish]] suzerainty, later under [[Ottoman Empire]] suzerainty, and the Moldavian control lasted for two centuries until 1774, when [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]] took control of Bukovina in the aftermath of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)|Russo-Turkish War]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Zhukovskyi |first=Arkadii |date=2010 |title=Chernivtsi |url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CC%5CH%5CChernivtsi.htm |access-date=2022-10-18 |website=Encyclopedia of Ukraine}}</ref> Chernivtsi (known at that time as {{lang|de|Czernowitz}}) became the center of the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]]'s [[Bukovina District]] until 1848, later becoming the [[Duchy of Bukovina]] until 1918. In the aftermath of [[World War I]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] united with Bukovina in 1918, which led to the city regaining its Romanian name of {{lang|ro|Cernăuți}}; this lasted until the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|occupied]] Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. Chernivtsi was under the control of the [[Soviet Union]] from 1940 to 1941, after which Romania recovered the city, and then again from 1944 until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], after which it became part of [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|independent Ukraine]].

Chernivtsi is viewed as one of Western Ukraine's main cultural centers. The city is also considered one of Ukraine's important educational and architectural sites.

== Names ==
Aside from its Ukrainian name of Chernivtsi, the city is also known by several different names in various languages, which still are used by the respective population groups much as they used to be throughout the city's history, either in connection with the rule by one country or another or independently from it: {{langx|ro|Cernăuți}} ({{IPA|ro|tʃernəˈutsʲ||Ro-Cernăuți.ogg}}); {{langx|de|Czernowitz}} ({{IPA|de|ˈtʃɛɐ̯novɪts||De-Czernowitz.ogg}}); {{langx|pl|Czerniowce}}; {{langx|hu|Csernovic}}, {{langx|yi|טשערנאָוויץ|Tshernovits}}, {{langx|ru|Черновцы́|Chernovtsy}}, (In {{langx|ru|label=Russian until 1944|Чернови́цы|Chernovitsy}}).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0:Sbornik_zakonov_1938-1956.djvu/87|title=Страница:Sbornik zakonov 1938-1956.djvu/87 — Викитека|website=ru.wikisource.org}}</ref>

In the times of [[Halych-Volyn Principality]] (1199-1253), the city's name was ''Chern''.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

In "Documents of Western Russia" ({{langx|ru|Акты Западной России}}) published in Saint Petersburg in 1846 (Volume 1, page 32, document #21), the city is mentioned as Chernov'tsi ({{langx|ru|Черновьци}}).

=== Prehistory ===
Archaeological evidence discovered in the area surrounding Chernivtsi indicates that a population inhabited it since the [[Neolithic]] era. Later settlements included those of the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20043/34|title=Trypillya&nbsp;– a culture that was contemporaneous with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia|access-date=27 September 2007|work=Welcome to Ukraine}}</ref> the [[Corded Ware culture]]; artifacts from the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s were also found in the city. In the Middle Ages there lived East Slavic tribes [[White Croats]] and [[Tivertsi]].<ref>{{cite book|chapter=ЧЕРНІВЕЦЬКА ОБЛАСТЬ|trans-chapter=Chernivtsi Region|chapter-url=http://www.history.org.ua/?termin=Chernivetska_oblast|author=Верменич Я.

=== Under Principality of Halych ===
A fortified settlement located on the left (north-eastern) shore of the Prut dates back to the time of the [[Galicia-Volhynia|Principality of Halych]] and is thought to have been built by [[Knyaz|Grand Prince]] [[Yaroslav Osmomysl]].<ref name="hist">{{cite web|url=http://www.komkon.org/~sher/chern/hist.html |title=City of Chernivtsi&nbsp;– History |access-date=25 September 2007 |work=The Komkon Site |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927041104/http://www.komkon.org/~sher/chern/hist.html |archive-date=27 September 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> Legendary accounts refer to this fortress-city as ''Chern''', or ''Black city''; it is said to owe its name to the black color of the city walls, built from dark [[oak]] layered with [[chernozem|local black-colored soil]].<ref name="city.cv.ua">{{cite web|url=http://www.city.cv.ua/English/History/|title=History|access-date=25 September 2007|work=Chernivtsi City Official Site}}</ref> This early stronghold was destroyed during the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] by [[Boroldai]] in 1259. However, the remaining ramparts of the fortress were still used for defense purposes; in the 17th century they were augmented with several bastions, one of which is still extant.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

[[File:Greater austria ethnic.svg|thumb|right|250px|Map of the ''[[United States of Greater Austria]]'', proposed in 1906, shows the city at the border of the areas inhabited by Romanians and Ukrainians.]]

Following the destruction of the fortress, later settlements in the area centered on the right (south-western) shore of the Prut River, at a more strategically advantageous, elevated location. In 1325, when the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]] seized control of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], and came into contact with the early [[Vlachs|Vlach]] ([[Romanians|Romanian]]) feudal formations, a fort was mentioned under the name ''Țețina''; it was defending the ford and crossing point on the [[Prut River]]. It was part of a group of three fortifications; the other two being the fortress of [[Khotyn|Hotin]] on the Dniester to the east, and a fort on the [[Kolachin River]], an upriver tributary of Prut.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

=== Under the Principality of Moldavia ===
{{See also|Battle of Cernăuți}}
Between 1359 and 1775, the city and its surroundings were part of the [[Moldavia|Principality of Moldavia]], one of the historic provinces of [[Romania]]; the city being the administrative center of the [[Cernăuți County|homonymous ''ținut'' (county)]].<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Pahomi |first=Mircea |date=1998 |title=Cetatea Ţeţina – Cernăuţi |url=http://astra.iasi.roedu.net/texte/pahomi.html |magazine=Astra |language=ro |issue=3 #13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009104301/http://astra.iasi.roedu.net/texte/pahomi.html |archive-date=9 October 2011}}</ref> The name Cernăuți is first attested in a document by [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexandru cel Bun (Alexander the Good)]] on 8 October 1408.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Ghenghea |first=Mircea-Cristian |date=2008 |title=Cernăuţi-600 de ani de atestare documentară internă |url=http://astra.iasi.roedu.net/revistaromana/ |magazine=Astra |language=ro |issue=4 #54 |page=3 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009104345/http://astra.iasi.roedu.net/revistaromana/ |archive-date=9 October 2011}}</ref> In [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sources, the city was mentioned as "Çernovi".{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

=== Under Austro-Hungarian rule ===
In 1775, the northwestern part of the territory of Moldavia was annexed by the [[Habsburg monarchy|Habsburg Empire]]; this region became known as [[Bukovina]]. The city became the region's capital, organized as the [[Bukovina District]] part of the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]], which in 1849 was raised in status and became known as the [[Duchy of Bukovina]], a [[Cisleithania#Crown lands|crownland]] of the [[Austrian Empire]]. The city received [[Magdeburg rights]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://heraldry.com.ua/index.php3?lang=E&context=info&id=1155 |title=Chernivtsi|access-date=25 September 2007|work=Ukrainian heraldry}}</ref> The city began to flourish in 1778 when Knight [[Karl von Enzenberg]] was appointed the chief of the Military Administration. He invited many merchants, craftsmen and entrepreneurs to help develop trade and other businesses. [[Saint Peter]]'s Fairs (1–15 July) had given a new vibrant impulse to the market development from 1786. In the late 19th century the German language—due to the Habsburg and the very important Jewish influence—became the lingua franca and more and more newspapers were edited in German, also a remarkable literary production in German began in this period, featuring most prominently [[Karl Emil Franzos]].<ref>Ion Lihaciu, Czernowitz 1848–1948. Das kulturelle Leben einer Provinzmetropole, Parthenon Verlag, Kaiserslautern und Mehlingen 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-942994-00-2}}</ref>

During the 19th and early 20th century, Chernivtsi became a center of both Romanian and Ukrainian national movements. In 1908, it was the site of the first [[Yiddish language]] conference, the [[Czernowitz Conference]], coordinated by [[Nathan Birnbaum]]. When [[Austria-Hungary]] dissolved in 1918, followed by two years of political uncertainty in Europe due to the aftermath of [[World War I]], the city and its surrounding area [[Union of Bukovina with Romania|became part]] of the [[Kingdom of Romania]], which gained worldwide diplomatic recognition by the end of 1920.<ref name="eb">{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9017989/Bukovina |title=Bukovina|access-date=26 September 2007|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}</ref> During those two years, even most city residents did not know of which country they were citizens, with most assuming Czernowitz still belonged to Austria-Hungary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gr-czernowitz.livejournal.com/2727944.html|title = Карта "Еврейские Черновцы" на немецком языке}}</ref> German remained the [[lingua franca]] of the city and its suburbs for another decade. In 1930, the city reached a population of 112,400: 26.8% [[Jews]], 23.2% [[Romanians]], 20.8% [[Bukovina Germans|Germans]], 18.6% [[Ukrainians]], the remainder [[Polish people|Poles]] and others. It was one of the five university centers of interwar Romania.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

=== Soviet occupation and rule ===
[[File:Вступ частин Червоної Армії до Чернівців 1940 р.jpg|thumb|Soviet occupation troops entering Chernivtsi in 1940]]
In 1940, the [[Red Army]] [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|occupied the area]]; the area around the city became known as [[Chernivtsi Oblast]], and was allotted to the [[Ukrainian SSR]] by the Soviet Union.<ref name="eb" /> The city's large Romanian intelligentsia found refuge in Romania; while the Bukovina Germans were "repatriated" according to a Soviet-Nazi agreement. Under the regime of military dictator [[Ion Antonescu]], Romania had switched from an ally of France and Britain to one of Nazi Germany; subsequently, in July 1941, the Romanian Army retook the city as part of the [[Operation Barbarossa|Axis attack on the Soviet Union]] during World War II. Chernivtsi would become the capital of the Romanian [[Bukovina Governorate]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.rtsa.ro/rtsa/index.php/rtsa/article/view/166|title=Administrarea teritoriului României în timpul celui de-al doilea Război Mondial|first=Viorel|last=Stănică|journal=Transylvanian Review of Administrative Sciences|volume=9|issue=19|year=2007|pages=107–116|language=ro}}</ref> In August 1941, Antonescu ordered the creation of a [[ghetto]] in the lowland part of the city, where 50,000 [[Bukovina Jews]] were crammed, two-thirds of whom would be deported in October 1941 and early 1942 to [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]], where the majority died. The Romanian mayor of the city [[Traian Popovici]] managed to persuade Antonescu to raise the number of Jews exempted from deportation from 200 to 20,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dt.ua/SOCIETY/bukovinskiy_shindler.html|title=Bukovinian Schindler|website=DT.ua|access-date=2019-12-28|archive-date=28 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191228145543/https://dt.ua/SOCIETY/bukovinskiy_shindler.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://versii.cv.ua/news/bukovynskyj-shyndler-kolyshnij-mer-chernivtsiv/14230.html|title=Bukovinian Schindler – former mayor of Chernivtsi|date=2011-09-15|website=Чернівці, Чернівецька область – новини в газеті Версії|language=uk|access-date=2019-12-28}}</ref>

In 1944, when [[Axis forces]] were driven out by the Red Army, the city was reincorporated into the Ukrainian SSR. Over the following years, most of the Jews emigrated to Israel; the city was an important node in the [[Berihah]] network. Bukovina Poles were expelled by the Soviets after World War II. The city became a predominantly Ukrainian one.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

=== Independence ===
Since 1991, Chernivtsi has been a part of an independent Ukraine. In May 1999, Romania opened a [[consulate general]] in the city.

Until 18 July 2020, Chernivtsi was designated as a [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]] and did not belong to any raion. As part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Chernivtsi Oblast to three, the city was merged into Chernivtsi Raion.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Про утворення та ліквідацію районів.

The medal "To the glory of Chernivtsi" is an honorary distinction of the [[Chernivtsi City Council]], introduced to the 600th Anniversary of Chernivtsi (2008) in order to reward individuals who actively contributed to the prosperity of the city and its promotion in Ukraine and the world. The award is made of [[silver-gilt]], it has a circle shape with a diameter of 28&nbsp;mm (1"). The medal's strip is white with red stripes, which corresponds to the colours of the Chernivtsi flag. At the bottom of the strip, there is a beech branch. The obverse depicts the emblem of Chernivtsi and the inscription – "To the glory of Chernivtsi". On the reverse – the official Chernivtsi logo, designed and approved for the anniversary. The medal is awarded, according to the decision of the executive committee of the City Council, annually during the celebration of the city day.

The official motto of modern Chernivtsi, "Спільними зусиллями!", is a Ukrainian-language version of the Latin ''Viribus Unitis'' ("With United Forces"), the personal motto of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]], who personally bestowed the right to use it on Chernivtsi. This indicates a special attitude of the emperor to the city. Along with the capital of Bukovina, only the first naval ship of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ([[SMS Viribus Unitis|SMS ''Viribus Unitis'']]) was honoured with such honour.

=== Logotype of Chernivtsi ===
The official <nowiki>''Chernivtsi 600'' logo was developed and approved by the anniversary of the city in 2008. It was recognized so successful that it continues to be used. The main idea of components for emblem is based on the antiquity of the city, its exceptional architectural heritage and the hard work of its inhabitants. The symbol is made in the form of a blacksmith'</nowiki>s work of art, which testifies to the soundness, prosperity, and success. The color scheme of the logo, represented by dark blue and yellow, has a higher degree of comfortable contrast and coincides with the colors of the [[Flag of Ukraine|State Flag of Ukraine]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brandbook.kiev.ua/2010/09/600.html|title=The logo of the 600th anniversary of Chernivtsi was presented|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927235108/http://www.brandbook.kiev.ua/2010/09/600.html|archive-date=2013-09-27}}</ref>

In the early 2010s, a new city logo was developed and approved, and at the same time the official slogan was affixed: "Chernivtsi is unique in diversity". Old and new symbols of Chernivtsi were chosen for its creation. To the left, in the foreground, there is a trumpet player who wins the trumpet tune "Marichka". In the middle of the background, there is the town hall. The former [[Residence of Bukovinian and Dalmatian Metropolitans|Metropolitan Residence of Bukovina and Dalmatia]] which is recognized as the architectural pearl of the city is pictured to the right in the background.

The colour scheme of the logo represented in orange, blue and red, the name is purple. Such a combination is characteristic of tourism, which uses the notion of happiness, well-being, the joy of relaxation, visualizing positive symbols and images in a colourful, warm and vibrant colour scheme. The new logo uses old symbols from the "Chernivtsi 600" logo.

=== Landscape ===
The total area of Chernivtsi within the administrative boundaries of 2013 is about {{cvt|153|km2}}. According to the functional purpose the lands of the city are divided as follows: land of residential and public buildings (64%), lands of agricultural purpose (17%), lands of industry (9%), lands of recreational and environmental purpose (5%), lands of general use (3%), commercial land (2%).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chernivtsy.eu/strategy/news/shanovni-chernivchany/176|title=Discussion of the Strategic Plan for the Development of the City of Chernivtsi for 2012 – 2016}}</ref>

The main water source of Chernivtsi is the [[Prut river|Prut River]] in its upper reaches, which divides the city in half. Besides, there are six small streams and nine lakes within the city.

The relief is characterized by significant relief dip – from 150 metres (492') above sea level in the Prut valleys to 537 metres (1762') in the western outskirts (Mount [[Tsetzino]]), which is caused by the location on the [[Chernivtsi Upland]].

Chernivtsi is considered to be a "green city": the large territory is occupied by parks, squares, gardens, alleys and flower gardens. Nine objects are recognized as monuments of landscape art. The city has a botanical garden at the Yuriy Fedkovych National University with a unique orangery. Among the relict plants growing in the botanical garden, a special place is occupied by a giant [[Sequoiadendron]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pogliad.ua/news/chernivtsi/rekonstruyovana-oranzhereya-botsadu-bude-vischoyu-za-koleso-oglyadu-261002|title=Реконструйована оранжерея ботсаду буде вищою за колесо огляду|website=Погляд – новини Чернівці та Чернівецької області|access-date=20 January 2020|archive-date=31 May 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230531170445/https://pogliad.ua/news/chernivtsi/rekonstruyovana-oranzhereya-botsadu-bude-vischoyu-za-koleso-oglyadu-261002|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Chernivtsi is located in the center of [[Chernivtsi Regional Park]], which borders zakaznik "Thetzino" in the west and [[Mount Berda]] in the north.

=== State of the environment ===
At the end of the twentieth century, the main pollutants of the Chernivtsi environment were industrial enterprises, including the MIC. In the 1990s much of them ceased to exist or significantly reduced production capacity and thus reduced industrial emissions. Despite this, 58 enterprises (38.4% of the total amount in the region) are the main pollutants of the environment. Approximately 1.2 tonnes of pollutants are released into the air annually (34.9% of the total area emissions). Non-methane [[volatile organic compound]]s, carbon dioxide and substances in the form of solid suspended solids predominate in the structure of the emitted pollutants. In addition, carbon dioxide, which has a [[greenhouse effect]], is periodically released into the atmosphere of the city. Emissions from stationary sources were 7.9 tonnes per {{cvt|1|km2}} of Chernivtsi territory. Each inhabitant of the regional center accounts for an average of {{cvt|4.8|kg}} of harmful emissions per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://golovne.net/suspilstvo/stan-dovkillia-m-chernivtciv-u-2009-rotci.html|title=State of environment of the Chernivtsi in 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928031913/http://golovne.net/suspilstvo/stan-dovkillia-m-chernivtciv-u-2009-rotci.html|archive-date=2013-09-28}}</ref>

In 2008, Chernivtsi established an Environmental Monitoring System (EMS), an information structure that integrates environmental monitoring organizations and industrial enterprises that pollute the environment or which may adversely affect the environment or its components.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://versii.cv.ua/news/monitorymo-dovkillya/354.html|title=Моніторимо довкілля|date=2008-06-06|website=Чернівці, Чернівецька область – новини в газеті Версії|language=uk|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref>

Since the late 1990s, transport is a significant factor in the negative impact on the environment. To some extent, the situation was improved with the construction of the first (2004) and the second (2010) queues of the [[Bypass (road)|bypass road]], which connected the directions "Kyiv-Chernivtsi" and "Chernivtsi-Suceava". The problem of transit transport in the city will be finally resolved after the construction of the third branch of the bypass road, which will connect the directions "Suceava-Chernivtsi" and "Chernivtsi-Lviv".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://versii.cv.ua/ekonomichni/ob-yizdnih-dorig-stane-bil-she/96.html|title=Об'їздна дорога в Чернівцях|date=2008-04-01|website=Чернівці, Чернівецька область – новини в газеті Версії|language=uk|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref>

The Romanian population in Chernivtsi started decreasing rapidly after 1950. Many Romanians fled to Romania or were deported to [[Siberia]] (where most of them died), and the remaining Romanian population quickly became a minority and assimilated with the majority.{{cn|date=June 2024}} According to minority organizations, the Romanian minority in Chernivtsi is still decreasing nowadays as a result of [[cultural assimilation]] and emigration to Romania.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.mediafax.ro/social/romanii-din-ucraina-suntem-intre-asimilarea-promovata-de-ucraina-si-ofensiva-facuta-de-rusia-ne-ingrijoreaza-ca-din-toamna-armata-va-recruta-baieti-de-18-ani-13073207 | title=Românii din Ucraina: Suntem între asimilarea promovată de Ucraina şi ofensiva făcută de Rusia.

Chernivtsi once had a Jewish community of over 50,000, less than a third of whom survived World War II. Romanian lawyer and reserve officer {{ill|Theodor Criveanu|he|תיאודור קריביאנו|ro|Theodor Criveanu}}, as well as the then city mayor [[Traian Popovici]], supported by General [[Vasile Ionescu]] saved 19,689 Jewish people.

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the majority of the remaining Jewish population emigrated to Israel and the United States. A famous member of this latter emigration is the actress [[Mila Kunis]].<ref>[http://gazeta.ua/index.php?id=303824 Міла Куніс зіграє у трилері "Чорний лебідь"], Gazeta.ua (13 August 2009) {{in lang|uk}}</ref>

Chernivtsi was inhabited by Ukrainians, Romanians, Poles, [[Ruthenians]], Jews, [[Romani people|Roma]], and [[Germans]]. During its affiliation with the [[Austro-Hungarian]] monarchy, Chernivtsi enjoyed prosperity and culture as the capital of the [[Bukovina]] [[crown land#Austria|crown land]]. Until 1918, the main language of the city was German, which, in addition to the Germans, was also spoken by Jews (together they made up half the population of the city) and even partly by Ukrainians, Romanians and Poles. After [[World War II]], the [[Shoah]] and [[Porajmos]], and the resettlement and expulsion of the whole ethnic groups, including Germans and Romanians, this status was diminished. Today, the Ukrainians are the dominant population group.

Chernivtsi's change in demographic diversity is demonstrated by the following population statistics. Once, Romanians and Ukrainians formed the majority of the population. However, after 1870, [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]-speaking or [[German language|German]]-speaking Jews surpassed the Romanians as the largest population group of the town. After 1880, the Ukrainians surpassed the Romanians as the second-largest population group.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}
