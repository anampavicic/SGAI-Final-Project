==History==
The area of the modern city of Daitō was within ancient [[Kawachi Province]]. During the [[Jōmon period]], the area was under [[Kawachi Bay]], and inlet of [[Osaka Bay]]. By the [[Yayoi period]], Kawachi Bay had become a lake, and many settlements arose on its shores. During the [[Kofun period]], many [[kofun|burial mounds]] were built around the foot of Mount Iimori. Lake Kawachi continued to shrink in the [[Nara period]] and [[Heian period]], and the area developed along the Higashikoya highway, which connected [[Mount Koya]] with [[Kyoto]] and with the coast. During the [[Sengoku period]], the [[Miyoshi clan]] dominated Kawachi Province from their stronghold at [[Iimoriyama Castle]]. During the [[Edo Period]], the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] diverted the course of the [[Yamato River]] as part of a massive flood control project, which also resulted in the creation of a large amount of new farmland. In addition to rice, the production of cotton and rapeseed created local prosperity.

The villages of Suminodo, Nango and Shijo were established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889.
