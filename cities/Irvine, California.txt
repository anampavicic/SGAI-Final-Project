'''Irvine''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɜr|v|aɪ|n}}) is a [[Planned community|master-planned city]] in central [[Orange County, California]], United States, in the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]]. The [[Irvine Company]] started developing the area in the 1960s and the city was formally incorporated on December 28, 1971.

As of 2023, it is the second most populous city in Orange County, fifth most in the Greater Los Angeles region, and [[List of United States cities by population|63rd most in the United States]].

A number of corporations, particularly in the technology and semiconductor sectors, have their national or international headquarters in Irvine. Irvine is also home to several higher-education institutions including the [[University of California, Irvine]] (UCI), [[Concordia University Irvine|Concordia University]], [[Irvine Valley College]], and campuses of [[California State University, Fullerton]] (CSUF), [[University of La Verne]], and [[Pepperdine University]].

==History==
The [[Gabrieleño]] indigenous group inhabited Irvine about 2,000 years ago. [[Gaspar de Portolà]], a Spanish explorer, came to the area in 1769, which led to the establishment of forts, [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] and cattle herds. The [[King of Spain]] parceled out land for missions and private use.

After Mexico's independence from [[History of Spain (1808–1874)|Spain]] in 1821, the [[Mexican Congress]] passed the [[Mexican secularization act of 1833]] which secularized the missions and resulted in the Mexican government assuming control of the lands of said missions. It began distributing the land to Mexican citizens who applied for grants. Three large [[Ranchos of California|Spanish/Mexican land grants]], also known as ranchos, made up the land that later became the Irvine Ranch: [[Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana]], [[Rancho San Joaquin]] and [[Rancho Lomas de Santiago]].
[[File:Andrés Sepúlveda.png|thumb|left|upright|Much of Irvine was originally part of [[Rancho San Joaquín]], granted in 1842 to [[Sepúlveda family of California|José Andrés Sepúlveda]], a famed [[Californio]] vaquero.]]
[[File:Camp Bonita.jpg|thumb|right|Camp Bonita at Irvine Ranch in 1937]]
In 1864, [[Francisco Xavier Sepulveda|Jose Andres Sepulveda]], owner of Rancho San Joaquin, sold {{convert|50000|acre|km2|-1}} to Benjamin and Thomas Flint, Llewellyn Bixby and [[James Irvine (landowner)|James Irvine]] for $18,000 to resolve debts due to the Great Drought. In 1866, Irvine, Flint and Bixby acquired {{convert|47000|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} Rancho Lomas de Santiago for $7,000. After the [[Mexican-American War]] the land of Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana fell prey to tangled titles. In 1868, the ranch was divided among three claimants as part of a lawsuit: Flint, Bixby and Irvine. The ranches were devoted to sheep grazing. However, in 1870, [[tenant farming]] was permitted.

In 1878, [[James Irvine (landowner)|James Irvine]] acquired his partners' interests for $150,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|150000|1878}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). His {{convert|110000|acre|km2|-1}} stretched {{convert|23|mi|km|0}} from the Pacific Ocean to the [[Santa Ana River]]. James Irvine died in 1886. The ranch was inherited by his son, [[James Irvine (landowner)#James Irvine II|James Irvine II]], who incorporated it into the [[Irvine Company]]. James Irvine II shifted the ranch operations to field crops, olive and citrus crops.

In 1888, the [[Santa Fe Railroad]] extended its line to Fallbrook Junction, north of [[San Diego]], and named a station along the way after James Irvine. The town that formed around this station was named Myford, after Irvine's son, because a post office in [[Calaveras County]] already bore the family name. The town was renamed Irvine in 1914.<ref name="California Place Names">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kqwt5RlMVBoC&q=kathryn+irvine&pg=PA179 |title=California Place Names: The Origin |publisher=University of California Press | date = 2004 | author = Erwin Gustav Gudde, William Bright | isbn = 9780520242173 | access-date=January 28, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:IMAG0063.jpg|thumb|right|The developing urban core in the city of Irvine in 2010]]

By 1918, {{convert|60000|acre|km2|-1}} of [[lima beans]] were grown on the Irvine Ranch. Two [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] facilities, [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro|MCAS El Toro]] and [[Marine Corps Air Station Tustin|MCAS Tustin]], were built during World War II on ranch land sold to the government.

James Irvine II died in 1947 at the age of 80. His son, Myford, assumed the presidency of the Irvine Company. He began opening small sections of the Irvine Ranch to urban development.

The Irvine Ranch played host to the [[Boy Scouts of America]]'s [[1953 National Scout Jamboree]]. [[Jamboree Road]], a major street which now stretches from Newport Beach to the city of Orange, was named in honor of this event. [[David Sills (judge)|David Sills]], then a young Boy Scout from [[Peoria, Illinois]], was among the attendees at the 1953 Jamboree. Sills came back to Irvine as an adult and went on to serve four terms as the city's mayor.

Myford Irvine died in 1959. The same year, the [[University of California]] asked the Irvine Company for {{convert|1000|acre|km2|0}} for a new university campus. The Irvine Company [[nominal consideration|sold the requested land for $1]] and later [[Government of California|the state]] purchased an additional {{convert|500|acre|km2}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.uci.edu/ucihistory/index.php?page=early_years&function=selection |title=Anteater Chronicles |publisher=Lib.uci.edu |access-date=April 30, 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20071029025430/http://www.lib.uci.edu/ucihistory/index.php?page=early_years&function=selection |archive-date=October 29, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[William Pereira]], the university's consulting architect, and the Irvine Company planners drew up master plans for a city of 50,000 people surrounding the new university. The plan called for industrial, residential and recreational areas, commercial centers and greenbelts. The new community was to be named Irvine; the old agricultural town of Irvine, where the railroad station and post office were located, was renamed [[East Irvine]].<ref name="California Place Names"/> The first phases of the villages of Turtle Rock, University Park, Westpark (then called Culverdale), El Camino Real, and Walnut were completed by 1970.

On December 28, 1971, the residents of these communities voted to incorporate a substantially larger city than the one envisioned by the Pereira plan. By January 1999, Irvine had a population of 134,000 and a total area of {{convert|43|sqmi|km2|0}}.<ref name="ci.irvine"/>

In late 2003, after a ten-year-long legal battle, Irvine annexed the former [[El Toro Marine Corps Air Station]]. This added {{convert|7.3|mi2|km2}} of land to the city and blocked an initiative championed by [[Newport Beach]] residents to replace [[John Wayne Airport]] with a new airport at El Toro.<ref>{{citation|title=Irvine Wins Bid to Annex El Toro Site: The decision virtually ensures that the former Marine base will end up with development and open space instead of an airport|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 13, 2003|first=Daniel|last=Yi|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-nov-13-me-eltoro13-story.html}}</ref>  The [[Orange County Great Park]] was developed there.

==Geography==
Irvine borders [[Tustin]] to the north, [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]] to the northwest, [[Lake Forest, California|Lake Forest]] to the east and southeast, [[Laguna Hills]] and [[Laguna Woods]] to the south, [[Costa Mesa]] to the west, and [[Newport Beach]] to the southwest. Irvine also shares a small border with [[Orange, California|Orange]] to the north on open lands by the [[SR 261]].

[[San Diego Creek]], which flows northwest into [[Upper Newport Bay]], is the primary watercourse draining the city. Its largest tributary is [[Peters Canyon Wash]]. Most of Irvine is in a broad, flat valley between [[Loma Ridge]] in the north and [[San Joaquin Hills]] in the south. In the extreme northern and southern areas, however, are several hills, plateaus and canyons.

===Planned city===
[[File:Getting on the 405 at Jamboree.JPG|thumb|A view of the [[Irvine Business Complex]] and the 405 Freeway]]

Los Angeles architect [[William Pereira]] and Irvine Company employee [[Raymond Watson]] designed Irvine's layout beginning in the late 1950s, which is nominally divided into townships called "villages", separated by six-lane [[arterial road]]s. Each township contains houses of similar design, along with commercial centers, religious institutions, and schools. Commercial districts are checker-boarded in a periphery around the central townships. Only automobile transportation was planned for, with other forms of transportation ignored, resulting in Irvine becoming extremely [[Car dependency|car dependent]] today.

Pereira originally envisioned the university campus at the northern end of the Irvine Ranch. When the Irvine Company refused to relinquish valuable farmland in the flat central region of the ranch for this plan, the university site was moved to the base of the [[San Joaquin Hills|southern coastal hills]]. The city layout was based on the shape of a necklace (with the villages strung along two parallel main streets, which terminate at [[University of California, Irvine]] (UCI), the "pendant").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ucisca.wordpress.com/tag/william-pereira/|title=How Aldrich Park might have been|work=Odds and Ends from Special Collections and Archives|publisher=UC Irvine Libraries|date=April 19, 2010}}.</ref> Residential areas are now bordered by two commercial districts, the [[Irvine Business Complex]] to the west (part of the [[South Coast Plaza–John Wayne Airport edge city]]) and [[Irvine Spectrum]] to the east.

[[File:Map of planning areas Irvine CA.svg|thumb|250px|The planning areas of Irvine]]

All streets have [[landscaping]] allowances. Rights-of-way for powerlines also serve as bicycle corridors, parks, and greenbelts to tie together ecological preserves. The city irrigates the greenery with reclaimed water.
The [[Homeowners association|homeowners' associations]] which govern some village neighborhoods exercise varying degrees of control on the appearances of homes. In more restrictive areas, houses' roofing, paint colors, and landscaping are regulated. Older parts of the Village of Northwood that were developed beginning in the early 1970s independently of the Irvine Company and does not have homeowners' associations.The more tightly regulated villages generally offer more amenities, such as members-only swimming pools, tennis courts and parks.

Homeowners in villages developed in the 1980s and later may be levied a [[Mello-Roos]] special tax, which came about in the post-[[Proposition 13]] era.

===Climate===
Late spring and early summer in Irvine is subject to the [[June Gloom]] phenomenon widespread in southern California, with overcast mornings and occasional drizzle.
Late summer and autumn are warm and mostly dry, with occasional bouts of humid weather extending from [[Pacific hurricane]]s off the west coast of Mexico.
Winters are mild, with most winters having no frost, and can be hot and dry when the [[Santa Ana winds]] blow. Irvine has a [[Mediterranean climate]] wherein [[precipitation]] occurs predominantly during the winter months. Because Irvine is close to the coast, different parts of Irvine have different [[microclimate]]s; for instance, the June Gloom effect is stronger in the southern parts of Irvine, closer to the Pacific Ocean.

It can occasionally snow in the [[Santa Ana Mountains]] to the northeast of Irvine.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/county-646778-orange-snow.html|title=Southern California gets a rare treat: A snow day|date=December 31, 2014|newspaper=[[Orange County Register]]|access-date=October 17, 2016|archive-date=October 18, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018231212/http://www.ocregister.com/articles/county-646778-orange-snow.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Snow within the lower-lying parts of Irvine is very rare, but the area received three inches of snow in January 1949.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.coastmagazine.com/articles/orange-730-snow-county.html|title=A Snowcapped New Year in OC|date=December 22, 2008|magazine=Coast Magazine|first=Orien|last=Tippens}}</ref> A [[tornado]] touched down in Irvine in 1991, an event that happens in Orange County more generally approximately once every five years.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-03-01-mn-2155-story.html|title=Irvine Tornado One of a Rare Breed in O.C.|date=March 1, 1991|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>

====Mass transit and freight services====
[[File:Irvine Station (2013) 01.JPG|thumb|right|The Irvine Transportation Center, also known as the Irvine Station]]

=====Bus and shuttle services=====
Local bus routes are operated by the [[Orange County Transportation Authority]].

The city of Irvine has operated its own bus service called the iShuttle since 2008. Four weekday commuter shuttles serve major employers, residential areas, shopping centers, and transportation facilities. Two lines, Route A and Route B, connect the [[Tustin station|Tustin Metrolink Station]] to the Irvine Business Complex area. Route A provides service between the Tustin Metrolink Station and [[John Wayne Airport]] with stops along Von Karman Avenue. Route B heads along Jamboree Road before continuing through Main Street and Michelson Drive. The remaining two lines, Route C and Route D, offer connections between the Irvine Station and the Irvine Spectrum Area, which includes major employers, the [[Irvine Spectrum Center]], and residential communities The Park and The Village. Route C follows Irvine Center Drive and ends at the [[Capital Group Companies|Capital Group]] campus, while Route D serves the [[Irvine Spectrum Center]], [[Kaiser Permanente|Kaiser Permanente – Irvine Medical Center]], and [[Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian|Hoag Hospital Irvine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irvineshuttle.net/|title=Irvine Shuttle|date=August 9, 2016|access-date=May 26, 2017|archive-date=November 28, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128080903/http://irvineshuttle.net/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=====Passenger rail=====
Irvine is served by commuter rail to Los Angeles, San Diego, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties at both the [[Irvine Transportation Center|Irvine]] and [[Tustin station]]s of [[Metrolink (California)|Metrolink]]'s [[Orange County Line]] and [[Inland Empire–Orange County Line]], with Tustin Station being located adjacent to Irvine's western boundary. Currently, trains are infrequent for a city the size of Irvine, with Metrolink trains approximately every 30 minutes only during peak weekday commuting hours and no Metrolink service in off-peak directions or times. Amtrak trains run approximately every 60 to 180 minutes all days of the week along the [[Pacific Surfliner]] route between [[Santa Fe Depot (San Diego)|San Diego]] and [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Los Angeles]]. Amtrak trains stop only at the Irvine station, unlike Metrolink, which stops at both the Irvine and Tustin stations. All Amtrak service heading north stops at 10:49 PM, while southerly service stops at 11:12 PM, while Metrolink never operates trains after 7:39 PM. Rail2Rail monthly passes allow commuters to use both Metrolink and Amtrak services, standard tickets are specific to a single operator. The Irvine station features a four-story parking structure.

=====Freight rail=====
A major contributing factor to the growth of Irvine was by freight rail provided by [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|ATSF]] (now [[BNSF]]) Transportation. The Venta Spur was Irvine's first [[Spur line|spur]]. Built in the 1920s, it moved citrus from three processing plants in what is now Northwood to the rest of the country. The processing plants were essentially Irvine's first and biggest employers of the time.

The plants started to go out of business in the 1970s and the spur was abandoned in 1985. In 1999, following its donation to the city of Irvine, it was turned into the Venta Spur bike trail.

The Irvine Industrial Spur is the second railroad spur in Irvine. It serves various industries in Irvine's Business Complex.
