'''Nabadwip''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|æ|b|ə|ˈ|d|w|i:|p}}), also spelt '''Navadwip''', anciently '''Nadia''' or '''Nudiya''', is a heritage city in [[Nadia district]] in the Indian state of [[West Bengal]]. It is regarded as a holy place by Hindus, and is the birthplace of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]. Famous for Rass festival where city is illuminated with lights, deities of God and goddesses are made on each corner of Nabadwip town. Hundreds of people gather to this small town on the occasion of raas utsab. Located on the western bank of the [[Hooghly River]], it is considered to have been founded in 1063 CE, and served as the old capital of the [[Sena dynasty]]. A center of learning and philosophy in medieval India, the city is still noted for its traditional Sanskrit schools.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/406781/Navadwip |title=Navadwip |website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref> The [[Navya Nyaya]] school of [[logic]] reached its peak with the efforts of some well known contemporary philosophers of Nabadwip. The great [[Vaishnava]] saint, social reformer and an important figure of the [[Bhakti movement]], [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] (1486–1534) was born here. It was after Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's birth that Nabadwip became an important center of pilgrimage for the Vaishnavas worldwide as well as for Hindus in general. Many who follow [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] visit Nabadwip to celebrate the auspicious birthday day of Shri Mahaprabhu, which, as per lunar calculations, occurs on Phalguni Purnima (i.e. on the Full moon day of February–March). This day is commonly known as [[Gaura-purnima]].<ref name=Ro>{{cite journal

 | title = The Evolution And Organization Of Pilgrimage To Jagannstha At Purt
}}</ref> Aside from this, Nabadwip is visited for various other festivals like Dol Jatra and Rash purnima.

The [[Hoogly river|Bhagirathi river]] originally flowed down the west of Nabadwip in the past, forming a natural boundary between the districts of [[Purba Bardhaman district|Purba Bardhaman]] and [[Nadia district|Nadia]]. With time it has shifted its course to where it is at present, cutting the city off from the rest of the Nadia district.

==Etymology==
The name of the city is derived from the conjunction of the Bengali words '''/naba/ (new) and /dwipa/ (island)''' meaning New-island. In the down stream of the river [[Ganges]], the alluvial deposits carried over during its course that starts at the Himalayas, were gradually deposited, forming a new island which is present day's Nabadwip. The name Nabadwip and Nadia has the same connotation of the same geographical location flanked at west and north by the [[Ganges]] at earlier times.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mandal|first=Mrityunjoy|title=Nabadwiper Itibritta|publisher=Nabadwip Sahityo Somaj|year=2013|location=Nabadwip|pages=59}}</ref> Kabi Karnapur used ''Nabadwip'' as ''Nabīna dbīpaṁ'' (Bengali: ''নবীন দ্বীপং''), mean ''New Island'' in his book ''Chaitanya Charitamritam''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mandal|first=Mrityunjoy|title=Nabadwiper Itibritta|publisher=Nabadwip Sahityo Somaj|year=2013|location=Nabadwip|pages=58}}</ref><ref>Kabi Karnapur, Sri Chaitanya Charitam, 6|23</ref>

The claim that the name Nabadwip refers to an area comprising nine islets has no ground. There are many historical references in this respect. The misconception around the nomenclature of the name "Nabadwip" arose due to the publication of the book "Bhakti Ratnakar" of Narahari Chakraborty. Hence "Nabadwip" i.e. nine islands, namely Antardwip, Simantadwip, Rudradwip, Madhyadwip, Godrumdwip, Ritudwip, Jahnudwip, Modadrumdwip, and Koladwip. However again, it is to mention that  all these islands are loosely scattered over a vast geographical area that the Historians do not approve of the idea as being "Nabadwip".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mandal|first=Mrityunjoy|title=Nabadwiper Itibritta|publisher=Nabadwip Sahityo Somaj|year=2013|location=Nabadwip|pages=62}}</ref>

==History==
Although significant examples of the history of Nabadwip have been found since the [[Sena dynasty|Sen dynasty]], various historians have been referring to Nabadwip in the [[Pala Empire|Pala period]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Smith|first=vincent A.|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.100000|title=The Oxford History Of India,ed.2|date=1923|pages=184–185}}</ref> English historian [[John Clark Marshman]] mentioned Nabadwip as the capital of Adishur.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Marshman|first=John Clark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jwt0HAAACAAJ&q=Marshman's+History|title=Marshman's History of Bengal, in Bengali|date=1853|language=en}}</ref>

===Sena era===
It is known from the Deopara stone slab of [[Rajshahi District|Rajshahi district]] that Raja Samanta Sena, a resident of [[Karnataka]], lived in the Ganges-Pulin in his last years when he was defeated by his [[Leasehold estate|tenants]] and [[zamindar]]s. According to the eminent historian [[Hara Prasad Shastri|Harprasad Shastri]], Samanta Sen lived on the shores of [[Bhagirathi River|Bhagirathi]], probably in Nabadwip in his last years.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sastri Haraprasad|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.60489|title=A School History Of India|date=1896|pages=34}}</ref> Prior to [[Gauḍa (city)|Gour]], Nabadwip was the capital of [[Sena dynasty]] during the reigns of [[Ballala Sena|Ballal Sen]] and [[Lakshmana Sena|Lakshman Sen]]. They ruled Bengal from here in the period from 1159 to 1206. The Ballal Dhipi in the Bamanpukur area adjacent to Nabadwip, which is associated with the history of [[Sena dynasty|Sen dynasty]], has been protected by the [[Archaeological Survey of India]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rāṛhī|first=Kānticandra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3NtPAQAAIAAJ|title=Nabadvīpa-mahimā|date=2004|publisher=Nabadvīpa Purātattva Parishada|pages=55|language=bn}}</ref> During the reign of [[Lakshmana Sena|Lakshman Sen]], in 1202 AD, [[Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji|Bakhtiyar Khalji]] invaded and plundered Nabadwip and defeated [[Lakshmana Sena|Lakshman Sen]], a victory that led to Muslim rule in Bengal. At that time the prosperity of Nabadwip was particularly damaged. During the Muslim rule, various temples, golden monasteries and idols of Bengal and Nabadwip were destroyed.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jūzjānī|first=Minhāj Sirāj|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u_ixTEEz8ssC&pg=556|title=Tabaḳāt-i-Nāṣirī: A General History of the Muhammadan Dynasties of Asia, Including Hindūstān, from A.H. 194 [810 A.D.], to A.H. 658 [1260 A.D.], and the Irruption of the Infidel Mug̲h̲als Into Islam|date=1881|publisher=Asiatic Society of Bengal|pages=559|language=en}}</ref>

===Chaitanya era===
The birth of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] is an important chapter of the fifteenth century. With the advent of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]], [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava culture]] was well established in Nabadwip. However, even before the birth of Mahaprabhu, during the reign of [[Jalaluddin Fateh Shah]] (1481–87), royal fear appeared in Nabadwip. The ruling society and the [[Brahmin]] society obstructed the spread of [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] culture in Nabadwip at that time.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Jaẏānanda|title=Jayānandaʼs Caitanya-maṅgala = Jaẏānanda biracita Caitanyamaṅgala|last2=Majumdar|first2=Bimanbehari|last3=Mukhopadhyay|first3=Sukhamay|date=1971|publisher=The Asiatic Society|location=Calcutta|oclc=499557268}}</ref> Many [[Brahmin]] scholars and common people had to leave Nabadwip at that time due to the oppression of the king. However, when Chand Kazi, the then ruler of Nabadwip, issued an order to the [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava community]] to stop chanting, [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Mahaprabhu]] went to Kazi's house with his companions and convinced the Kazi to allow the chanting, which is the first instance of civil disobedience movement in the history of India.<ref>{{Cite web|title=ধর্মের বেড়াজাল ভেঙে সাম্যের ধারণার প্রতিষ্ঠা|url=https://www.anandabazar.com/editorial/incarnation-of-chaitanya-mahaprabhu-is-a-path-breaking-chapter-in-the-history-of-bengal-1.968387|access-date=2020-06-18|website=anandabazar.com|language=bn}}</ref> During Chaitanya and later, various [[Pandit]]s-Sadhaks-Vidyalankars and Sanskrit Pandits were born in Nabadwip. During the period of Chaitanya, [[Vasudeva Sarvabhauma|Basudev Sarvabhauma]], [[Raghunatha Siromani|Raghunath Shiromani]], [[Raghunandana|Raghunandan]] etc. and later [[Krishnananda Agamavagisha]], [[Buno Ramnath]] etc., Nabadwip became the main center of Sanskrit practice and learning.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mookerji|first=Radhakumud|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjFfqpq7HhkC|title=Ancient Indian Education: Brahmanical and Buddhist|date=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-0423-4|language=en}}</ref> At the time of Raja Rudra Roy, there were four thousand students and six hundred professors teaching in Nabadwip, leading to its nickname as the "Oxford of Bengal".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cotton|first=Sir Evan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a3scAAAAMAAJ|title=Calcutta, Old and New: A Historical and Descriptive Handbook to the City|date=1980|publisher=General Printers & Publishers|pages=1|language=en}}</ref>

===Next centuries===
Buno Ramnath, Shankara Tarkabagish and other scholars and logicians made the name of Nabadwip famous in the eighteenth century. [[Shakti]] worship spread in Nabadwip during the time of [[Krishnachandra Roy|Raja Krishnachandra]] of Nadia royal family. During the reign of Raja Krishnachandra Roy and later Raja Girish Chandra, the popularity, glory and pomp of [[Shakta Rash]] increased. Various temples and idols were established in that time.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Roy|first=Alok Ed|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.265018|title=Sekaler Darogar Kahini Ed. 2nd|date=1958}}</ref>
