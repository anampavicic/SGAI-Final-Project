[[File:National Highway 58 (India).png|thumb|alt= NH-58 passing through Muzaffarnagar|NH-58 passing through M.Nagar]]
The National Highway - 58 (NH-58) passes through Muzaffarnagar city. This highway provides connections towards Delhi on the southern direction and upper reaches of the Himalayas in the [[Uttarakhand]] state in the northern direction. The highway is the backbone of road transportation for the Muzaffarnagar city as well as the [[Garhwal division|Garhwal region]] of Uttarakhand. Cities and areas of Hardwar, Rishikesh, Dehradun as well as [[Badrinath]] and [[Kedarnath]] are served by this highway.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

City transportation mostly consists of tricycles and 3-wheeled vehicles, rickshaws.

===Environmental concerns===
Muzaffarnagar lies approximately halfway on the road from Delhi to Uttarakhand [[Rishikesh]] (the [[National highways in India|NH]]-58). As a result, many roadside resorts and eateries have sprung up on the highway near the city. Especially, the town of [[Khatauli]] is famed for its canal side forest park named "Cheetal". Once visited for the sight of [[deer]] and [[rabbits]] and other wild animals, the Cheetal is now encroached by privately owned [[dhaba]]s and resorts thus sidelining the animals.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}
