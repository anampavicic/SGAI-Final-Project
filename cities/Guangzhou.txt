The [[Chinese character|character]] {{linktext|lang=zh-Hant|廣}} or {{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|广}} means 'broad' or 'expansive'.

Before acquiring its current name, the town was known as Panyu (Punyü; {{linktext|lang=zh-Hant|番禺}}), a name still borne by [[Panyu District|one of Guangzhou's districts]] not far from the main city.

The [[Chinese abbreviation]] for Guangzhou is {{linktext|lang=zh|穗}}, pronounced {{transl|yue|Seoi<sup>6</sup>}} in Cantonese and {{transl|zh|Suì}} in Mandarin—although the abbreviation on car license plates, as with the rest of the province, is {{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|粤}}), after its nickname "City of Rice" ({{linktext|lang=zh|穗城}}. The city has long borne the nickname {{nowrap|City of Rams}} ({{linktext|lang=zh|羊城}}) or {{nowrap|City of the Five Rams}} ({{linktext|lang=zh|五羊城}}) from the five stones at the old [[Temple of the Five Immortals (Guangzhou)|Temple of the Five Immortals]] said to have been the sheep or goats ridden by the [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[culture hero]]es credited with introducing [[rice cultivation]] to the area around the time of the city's foundation.<ref>{{cite book |year=1834 |title=The Chinese Repository |volume=II |edition=2nd |publisher=Kraus }}</ref> The former name "City of the [[Taoist Immortal|Immortals]]" ({{linktext|lang=zh|仙城}}/{{lang|zh|五仙城}}) came from the same story. The more recent {{nowrap|City of Flowers}} ({{linktext|lang=zh|花城}}) is usually taken as a simple reference to the area's fine greenery.

The English name "Canton" derived from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{lang|pt|Cidade de Cantão}},<ref>{{cite book |title=Santa Barbara Portuguese Studies |volume=I–II |year=1994 |page=256 |publisher=Jorge de Sena Center for Portuguese Studies}}</ref> a blend of [[dialects of Chinese|dialectal]] pronunciations of "Guangdong"<ref>{{cite book |title=T'ien Hsia Monthly |volume=VII |page=426 |year=1939 |publisher=Sun Yat-sen Institute}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |edition=11th  |publisher=Merriam-Webster |isbn=9780877798095 |year=2004 }}</ref> (e.g., [[Cantonese]] ''Gwong2-dung1''). Although it originally and chiefly applied to the walled city, it was occasionally conflated with Guangdong by some authors. It was adopted as the [[Postal Map Romanization]] of Guangzhou, and remained the official name until its [[pinyin|name change]] to "Guangzhou". As an adjective, it is still used in describing the [[Cantonese people|people]], [[Cantonese language|language]], [[Cantonese cuisine|cuisine]] and [[Cantonese culture|culture]] of Guangzhou and the surrounding Liangguang region. The 19th-century name was "{{nowrap|Kwang-chow foo}}".{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=37}}

Incorporated into the [[Western Han dynasty|Han dynasty]], Panyu became a provincial capital. In AD 226, it became the seat of Guang [[zhou (country subdivision)|Prefecture]], which gave it its modern name.

Amid the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] that followed the collapse of the [[Tang dynasty]], the [[Later Liang (Five Dynasties)|Later Liang]] governor [[Liu Yan (emperor)|Liu Yan]] used his base at Panyu to establish a "Great Yue" or "[[Southern Han]]" empire, which lasted from 917 to 971.

Shortly after the [[Hongwu Emperor]]'s declaration of the [[Ming dynasty]], he reversed his earlier support of [[foreign trade]] and imposed the first of a series of [[haijin|sea bans]] ({{zh|t=|labels=no|s=海禁}}).{{sfnp|Von Glahn|1996|p=90}} These banned private foreign trade upon penalty of death for the merchant and exile for his family and neighbors.{{sfnp|Li|2010|p=3}} Previous maritime intendancies of Guangzhou, [[Quanzhou]], and [[Ningbo]] were closed in 1384{{sfnp|Von Glahn|1996|p= 116}} and legal trade became limited to the [[imperial Chinese tributary system|tribute delegations]] sent to or by official representatives of foreign governments.{{sfnp|Von Glahn|1996|p= 91}}

In the 19th century, most of the city's buildings were still only one or two stories. However, there were notable exceptions such as the [[Flower Pagoda]] of the [[Temple of the Six Banyan Trees]], and the guard tower known as the [[Zhenhai Tower (Guangzhou)|Five-Story Pagoda]]. The subsequently urbanized northern hills were bare and covered with traditional graves. The brick city walls were about {{cvt|6|mi|0}} in circumference, {{cvt|25|ft|0}} high, and {{cvt|20|ft|0}} wide. Its eight main gates and two water gates all held guards during the day and were closed at night. The wall rose to incorporate a hill on its northern side and was surrounded on the other three by a moat which, along with the canals, functioned as the city's sewer, emptied daily by the river's tides. A partition wall with four gates divided the northern "old town" from the southern "new town" closer to the river; the suburb of [[Xiguan]] (Saikwan; "West Gate") stretched beyond and the boats of fishers, traders, and [[Tanka people|Tanka]] ("boat people") almost entirely concealed the riverbank for about {{cvt|4|mi|0}}. It was common for homes to have a storefront facing the street and to treat their [[Chinese courtyard house|courtyards]] as a kind of warehouse.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=37}} The city was part of a network of signal towers so effective that messages could be relayed to [[Beijing]]—about {{cvt|1200|mi|sp=us|0}} away—in less than 24 hours.{{sfnp|Kjellberg|1975|p=95}}

Following a series of battles in the [[Pearl River Delta]], the British [[Battle of Canton (March 1841)|captured Canton]] on March 18, 1841.{{sfnp|''Bulletins &c.''|1841|p=357}} The [[Battle of Canton (May 1841)|Second Battle of Canton]] was fought two months later.{{sfnp|MacPherson|1842|pp=312 & 315}} Following the Qing's 1842 [[Treaty of Nanking|treaty]] with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], Guangzhou lost its privileged trade status as more and more [[treaty port]]s were opened to more and more countries, usually including extraterritorial enclaves. Amid the decline of Qing prestige and the chaos of the [[Red Turban Rebellion (1854–1856)]], the [[Punti]] and [[Hakka]] waged [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars|a series of clan wars]] from 1855 to 1867 in which one million people died. The foreign trade facilities were destroyed by local Chinese in the [[Second Opium War|Arrow War]] (1856–1858). The international community relocated to the outskirts and most international trade moved through [[Shanghai]].<ref>John King Fairbank, ''Trade and Diplomacy on the China Coast: The Opening of the treaty ports, 1842–1854'' (Harvard U.

The concession for the [[Guangzhou–Hankou railway|Guangdong–Hankou Railway]] was awarded to the [[American China Development Company|American China Development Co.]] in 1898. It completed [[Guangzhou–Sanshui Railway|its branch line]] west to [[Foshan]] and [[Sanshui]] before being engulfed in a diplomatic crisis after a Belgian consortium bought a controlling interest and the Qing subsequently canceled its concession.

Morgan]] was awarded millions in damages<ref>{{citation |last=Lee |first=En-han |year=1977 |title=China's Quest for Railway Autonomy, 1904–1911: A Study of the Chinese Railway-Rights Recovery Movement |publisher=Singapore University Press }}</ref> and the line to [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] was not completed until 1936<ref>{{citation |title=Canton–Hankow Railway |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=9 June 1936}}</ref> and the completion of a unified [[Beijing–Guangzhou Railway]] waited until the completion of [[Wuhan]]'s [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|Yangtze River Bridge]] in 1957.

=== Modern China===
==== Revolutions====
During the late Qing dynasty, Guangzhou was the site of revolutionary attempts such as the [[First Guangzhou Uprising|Uprisings of 1895]] and [[Second Guangzhou Uprising|1911]] that were the predecessors of the successful [[Xinhai Revolution]], which overthrew the Qing dynasty. The 72 revolutionaries whose bodies were found after the latter uprising are honored as the city's 72 [[martyrdom in Chinese culture|Martyrs]] at the Huanghuagang ("Yellow Flower Mound") Mausoleum.

==== Republic of China====
After the assassination of [[Song Jiaoren]] and [[Yuan Shikai]]'s attempts to remove the [[Nationalist Party of China]] from power, the leader of Guangdong [[Hu Hanmin]] joined the 1913 [[Second Revolution (China)|Second Revolution]] against him<ref>{{citation |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EisnZHAMbqkC&pg=PA298 |page=298 |contribution=Second Revolution |last=Lu |first=Fang-shang |author-mask=Lu Fang-shang |title=Modern China |editor=Wang Ke-wen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EisnZHAMbqkC |publisher=Garland Publishing |location=New York |date=1998 |access-date=August 31, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611222408/http://books.google.com/books?id=EisnZHAMbqkC&printsec=frontcover |archive-date=June 11, 2014 |url-status=live |isbn=9780419221609}}</ref> but was forced to flee to [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] with [[Sun Yat-sen]] after its failure. The city came under national spotlight again in 1917, when Prime Minister [[Duan Qirui]]'s abrogation of the constitution triggered the [[Constitutional Protection Movement]]. [[Sun Yat-sen]] came to head the [[Constitutional Protection Junta|Guangzhou Military Government]] supported by the members of the dissolved parliament and the Southwestern warlords. The Guangzhou government fell apart as the warlords withdrew their support. Sun fled to [[Shanghai International Settlement|Shanghai]] in November 1918 until the Guangdong warlord [[Chen Jiongming]] restored him in October 1920 during the [[Yuegui Wars]].{{sfnp|Beck|2007}} On June 16, 1922, Sun was ousted in a coup and fled on the warship ''[[SS Zhongshan|Yongfeng]]'' after Chen sided with the [[Zhili Clique]]'s [[Beiyang government|Beijing government]]. In the following months Sun mounted a counterattack into Guangdong by rallying supporters from Yunnan and Guangxi, and in January established [[Government of the Republic of China in Guangzhou|a government]] in the city for the third time.

From 1923 to 1926, Sun Yat-sen and the Kuomintang (KMT) [[Army and Navy Marshal stronghold of the Republic of China|used the city as a base]] to prosecute a renewed revolution in China by conquering the warlords in the north. Although Sun was previously dependent on opportunistic warlords who hosted him in the city, with the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, the KMT developed its own military power to serve its ambition. The Canton years saw the evolution of the KMT into a revolutionary movement with a strong military focus and ideological commitment, setting the tone of the KMT rule of China beyond 1927.

In 1924, the KMT made the momentous decision to ally with the Communist Party and the USSR. With Soviet help, KMT reorganized itself along the Leninist line and adopted a pro-labor and pro-peasant stance. The [[First United Front|Kuomintang-CCP cooperation]] was confirmed in the [[1st National Congress of Kuomintang|First Congress of the KMT]] and the communists were instructed to join the KMT. The allied government set up the [[Peasant Movement Training Institute]] in the city, of which Mao Zedong was a director for one term. Sun and his military commander Chiang used [[USSR|Soviet]] funds and weapons to build an armed force staffed by communist commissars, training its cadres in the [[Whampoa Military Academy]].{{sfnp|Beck|2007}} In August, the fledgling army suppressed the [[Canton Merchants' Corps Uprising]]. The next year the anti-imperialist [[May Thirtieth Movement]] swept the country, and the KMT government called for strikes in Canton and Hong Kong. The tensions of the massive strikes and protests led to the [[Shakee Massacre]].

After the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925 the mood was changing in the party toward the communists. In August the left-wing KMT leader [[Liao Zhongkai]] was assassinated and the right-wing leader [[Hu Hanmin]], the suspected mastermind, was exiled to the Soviet Union, leaving the pro-communist [[Wang Jingwei]] in charge. Opposing communist encroachment, the right-wing [[Western Hills Group]] vowed to expel the communists from the KMT. The "[[Canton Coup]]" on March 20, 1926, saw Chiang solidify his control over the [[KMT|Nationalists]] and [[National Revolutionary Army|their army]] against [[Wang Jingwei]], the party's left wing, its [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist]] allies, and its [[USSR|Soviet]] advisors.<ref>{{citation |last=Van de Ven |first=Hans |date=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC |title=War and Nationalism in China: 1925–1945 |series=Studies in the Modern History of Asia |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-14571-8 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC&pg=PA101 101 ff] |access-date=August 31, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225071802/https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC |archive-date=February 25, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=AhXiang1998>{{citation |author=Ah Xiang |contribution-url=http://www.republicanchina.org/Zhongshan-Warship-Incident.pdf |contribution=The ''Zhongshan'' Warship Incident |title=Tragedy of Chinese Revolution |date=1998 |access-date=July 13, 2016 |archive-date=April 15, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415103136/http://www.republicanchina.org/Zhongshan-Warship-Incident.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref> By May, he had ended civilian control of the military<ref name=AhXiang1998/> and begun his [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]] against the [[Warlord Era|warlords]] of the north. Its success led to the split of the KMT between Wuhan and Nanking and the purge of the communists in the [[April 12 Incident]]. Immediately afterwards Canton joined the purge under the auspice of [[Li Jishen]], resulting in the arrest of communists and the suspension of left wing KMT apparatuses and labor groups. Later in 1927 when [[Zhang Fakui]], a general supportive of the Wuhan faction, seized Canton and installed [[Wang Jingwei]]'s faction in the city, the communists saw an opening and launched the [[Guangzhou Uprising]]. Prominent communist military leaders [[Ye Ting]] and [[Ye Jianying]] led the failed defense of the city. Soon, control of the city reverted to [[Li Jishen]].

Li Jishen was deposed during a war between Chiang and the [[New Guangxi Clique]]. By 1929, [[Chen Jitang]] had established himself as the powerholder of Guangdong. In 1931 he threw his weight behind the anti-Chiang schism by hosting a separate Nationalist government in Guangzhou.<ref>李洁之，陈济棠主粤始末，《广州文史》第三十七辑。</ref> The opposition to Chiang included KMT leaders like [[Wang Jingwei]], [[Sun Fo]] and others from diverse factions. The peace negotiations amid the armed standoff led to the [[4th National Congress of Kuomintang]] being held separately by three factions in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Canton. Resigning all his posts, Chiang pulled off a political compromise that reunited all factions. While the intraparty division was resolved, Chen kept his power until he was defeated by Chiang in 1936. During the [[WW2]], the "[[Canton Operation]]" subjected the city to [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] occupation by the end of December 1938.

==== People's Republic of China====
Amid the closing months before total Communist victory, Guangzhou briefly served as the capital of the Republican government. Guangzhou was captured on October 14, 1949. Amid a massive exodus to [[Hong Kong]] and [[Colonial Macau|Macau]], defeated Nationalist forces blew up the [[Haizhu Bridge]] across the Pearl River in retreat. The Cultural Revolution had a large effect on the city, with many of its temples, churches and other monuments destroyed during this chaotic period.

The [[China|People's Republic of China]] initiated building projects including new housing on the banks of the Pearl River to adjust the city's [[Tanka people|boat people]] to life on land. Since the 1980s, the city's close proximity to [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shenzhen]] and its ties to [[overseas Chinese]] made it one of the first beneficiaries of China's [[opening up policy|opening up]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]]. Beneficial tax reforms in the 1990s also helped the city's industrialization and economic development.

The municipality was expanded in the year 2000, with [[Huadu District|Huadu]] and [[Panyu District|Panyu]] joining the city as [[district (China)|urban districts]] and [[Conghua]] and [[Zengcheng]] as more rural [[county (China)|counties]]. The former districts of [[Dongshan District, Guangzhou|Dongshan]] and [[Fangcun District|Fangcun]] were abolished in 2005, merged into [[Yuexiu District|Yuexiu]] and [[Liwan District|Liwan]] respectively. The city acquired [[Nansha, Guangzhou|Nansha]] and [[Luogang District|Luogang]]. The former was carved out of [[Panyu District|Panyu]], the latter from parts of [[Baiyun District, Guangzhou|Baiyun]], [[Tianhe District|Tianhe]], [[Zengcheng]], and an exclave within [[Huangpu District, Guangzhou|Huangpu]]. The [[National People's Congress]] approved a development plan for the [[Pearl River Delta]] in January 2009; on March 19 of the same year, the Guangzhou and [[Foshan]] municipal governments agreed to establish a framework to merge the two cities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2009-03/19/content_11037051.htm |title=Guangzhou and Foshan signed "City Merge Cooperation Framework" |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |access-date=May 6, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705135320/http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2009-03/19/content_11037051.htm |archive-date=July 5, 2009}}</ref> In 2014, [[Luogang District|Luogang]] merged into [[Huangpu District, Guangzhou|Huangpu]] and both [[Conghua District|Conghua]] and [[Zengcheng District|Zengcheng]] counties were upgraded to districts.

On 16 June 2022 an [[Tornadoes of 2022#June 16 (China)|EF2 tornado struck the city]], causing major power outages and knocking out power to the city's subway lines.<ref>{{cite web |title=Awesome photo shows the nighttime monster heading for Guangzhou Metropolitan. |url=https://twitter.com/ericwang1101/status/1537426124547891200 |website=Twitter |access-date=June 19, 2022 |language=en |archive-date=June 19, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220619005557/https://twitter.com/ericwang1101/status/1537426124547891200 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Damage survey suggests that the Guangzhou tornado had EF2 peak strength and traveled 1.5 km during its 5-minute lifetime. |url=https://twitter.com/cyanidecn_/status/1537801700093792256 |website=Twitter |access-date=June 19, 2022 |language=en |archive-date=June 19, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220619005635/https://twitter.com/cyanidecn_/status/1537801700093792256 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://watchers.news/2022/06/16/major-damage-after-large-tornado-hits-guangzhou-megalopolis-guangdong-china/ |title=Major damage after large tornado hits Guangzhou megalopolis – Guangdong, China |date=June 16, 2022 |website=watchers.news |publisher=The Watchers |access-date=June 20, 2022 |archive-date=April 9, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230409132943/https://watchers.news/2022/06/16/major-damage-after-large-tornado-hits-guangzhou-megalopolis-guangdong-china/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Natural resources===
There are 47 different types of minerals and also 820 ore fields in Guangzhou, including 18 large and medium-sized oil deposits. The major minerals are granite, cement limestone, ceramic clay, potassium, albite, salt mine, mirabilite, nepheline, syenite, fluorite, marble, mineral water, and geothermal mineral water. Since Guangzhou is located in the water-rich area of southern China, it has a wide water area with many rivers and water systems, accounting for 10% of the total land area. The rivers and streams improve the landscape and keep the ecological environment of the city stable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.gz.gov.cn/gzgoven/s3616/201008/789511.shtml |title=Guangzhou International |website=english.gz.gov.cn |access-date=November 8, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109085733/http://english.gz.gov.cn/gzgoven/s3616/201008/789511.shtml |archive-date=November 9, 2016}}</ref>

==== Water resources====
The main characteristics of Guangzhou's water resources are that there are relatively few local water resources and relatively abundant transit water resources. The city's water area is 74,400 hectares, accounting for 10.05% of the city's land area. The main rivers include Beijiang, Dongjiang North Mainstream, Zengjiang, Liuxi River, Baini River, Pearl River Guangzhou Reach, Shiqiao Waterway, and Shawan Waterway. Beijiang, The Dongjiang River flows through Guangzhou City and merges with the Pearl River to flow into the sea. The local average total water resources is 7.979 billion cubic meters, including 7.881 billion cubic meters of surface water and 1.487 billion cubic meters of groundwater. Calculated based on the amount of local water resources and the permanent population counted in the sixth census in 2010, there are 1.0601 million cubic meters of water resources per square kilometer, with an average of 628 cubic meters per capita, which is one-half of the country's per capita water resources. The amount of water resources for transit passengers is 186.024 billion cubic meters, which is 23 times the total local water resources. The passenger water resources are mainly concentrated in the southern Wanghe District and Zengcheng District. The passenger water resources diverted from the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers into Guangzhou City are 159.15 billion cubic meters, and the passenger water resources diverted from the Dongjiang River into the north mainstream of the Dongjiang River are 14.203 billion cubic meters. meters and the water inflow from the upper reaches of the Zengjiang River is 2.828 billion cubic meters. The southern river network area is in the tidal influence area, with large runoff and a strong tidal effect. The three major entrances of the Pearl River, Humen, Jiaomen, and Hongqili, enter the Lingding Ocean and exit the South China Sea in the south of Guangzhou City. The annual high tide volume is 271 billion cubic meters and the annual ebb tide volume is 408.8 billion cubic meters. The annual runoff of the three major entrances is 137.7 billion cubic meters. Compared with meters, the annual tide can bring a large amount of water, part of which is freshwater resources that can be utilized.<ref>The website of The People’s Government of Guangzhou Municipality. https://www.gz.gov.cn/m_index.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240907222736/https://www.gz.gov.cn/m_index.html |date=September 7, 2024 }}</ref>

====Biological Resources====
Cultivated crops in Guangzhou have the distinctive characteristics of the transition from the tropics to the subtropics, and it is one of the richest regions in China in terms of fruit tree resources, including three major categories of tropical, subtropical, and temperate zones, 41 families, 82 genera and 174 species, totaling more than 500 varieties (among which there are 55 major varieties of lychee). It is the center of origin and variety of lychee, longan, yellow skin, black (white) olive, and so on. Vegetables are known for their high quality and variety, with 15 major categories, 127 species, and more than 370 varieties. Flowers include fresh cut flowers (fresh cut flowers, fresh cut leaves, fresh cut branches), potted plants (potted flowers, bonsai, flower bed plants), ornamental seedlings, edible and medicinal flowers, industrial and other uses of flowers, lawns, seedlings, etc. More than 3,000 traditional varieties and in recent years the introduction of new varieties, development, and utilization. Grain, cash crops, livestock, poultry, aquatic products, wild animals, and a wide variety of famous and excellent varieties, including Zengcheng Simiao rice is the first protected variety in Guangzhou City to obtain geographical indications.<ref name="gov.cn">The website of The Central People's Government of the P.R.China. https://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2022-07/11/content_5700427.htm#allContent {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240327022825/https://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2022-07/11/content_5700427.htm#allContent |date=March 27, 2024 }}</ref>

====Mineral Resources====
The geological structure of Guangzhou City is quite complex, with good conditions for mineralization. Forty-seven kinds of minerals (including subspecies) have been discovered, with 820 mineral sites and 25 large and medium-sized mining areas. The main minerals are granite for construction, limestone for cement, ceramic clay, potassium, sodium feldspar, salt mines, manganese, nepheline orthoclase, fluorite, marble, mineral water, and thermal mineral water. Energy minerals and non-ferrous minerals in the area are in short supply, sporadically distributed, small in scale, and unstable in grade.<ref name="gov.cn"/>

The [[Canton Fair]], formally the "China Import and Export Fair", is held every year in April and October by the [[Ministry of Trade (China)|Ministry of Trade]]. Inaugurated in the spring of 1957, the fair is a major event for the city. It is the [[trade fair]] with the longest history, highest level, and largest scale in China.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cantonfair.org.cn/en/about/index.shtml |title=Canton Fair Online |date=January 19, 2016 |access-date=January 19, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123155215/http://www.cantonfair.org.cn/en/about/index.shtml |archive-date=January 23, 2016}}</ref> From the 104th session onwards, the fair moved to the new [[Guangzhou International Convention and Exhibition Center]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|广州|国际|会展|中心}}}}) in [[Pazhou]], from the older complex in Liuhua. The GICEC is served by two stations on [[Line 8 (Guangzhou Metro)|Line 8]] and three stations on [[Haizhu Tram|Tram Line THZ1]]. Since the 104th session, the Canton Fair has been arranged in three phases instead of two phases.

He Huifeng stated that factors included local authorities discouraging the use of Cantonese in schools and the rise in prestige of Mandarin-speaking Shenzhen.<ref>{{cite news |author=He, Huifeng |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2136237/why-has-cantonese-fallen-out-favour-guangzhou-youngsters |title=Why has Cantonese fallen out of favour with Guangzhou youngsters? |newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]] |date=March 12, 2018 |access-date=July 7, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707062441/https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2136237/why-has-cantonese-fallen-out-favour-guangzhou-youngsters |archive-date=July 7, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>  Jinan University released a survey result of the Guangzhou youths born in the year 2000 or after that were part of this educational study showed that 69% could still speak and understand Cantonese, 20% can understand Cantonese, but unable to speak it, and 11% completely had no knowledge of Cantonese. Jinan University's study of these Guangzhou youths also indicated when it came to the daily recreational use of Cantonese, roughly 40%-50% of them participated in these recreational functions with the usage of Cantonese with 51.4% of them in mobile games, 47% in Social Platforms, 44.1% in TV shows, and 39.8% in Books and Newspapers. Despite some decline in the use of Cantonese, it is faring better in survival, popularity, and prestige than other Chinese languages due to the historical pride in the language and culture, as well as the wide popularity and availability of mainstream Cantonese entertainment, which encourages locals to retain the Cantonese language.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://vincehkblog.wordpress.com/2018/05/13/is-cantonese-dying-in-canton-2/ |title=Is Cantonese dying in Canton? – Vince's News Corner |date=May 12, 2018 |access-date=July 29, 2021 |archive-date=July 29, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210729120128/https://vincehkblog.wordpress.com/2018/05/13/is-cantonese-dying-in-canton-2/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mironline.ca/the-slow-death-of-chinas-dialects/ |title=The Slow Death of China's Dialects – MIR |date=February 21, 2019 |access-date=July 29, 2021 |archive-date=August 12, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210812204137/https://www.mironline.ca/the-slow-death-of-chinas-dialects/ |url-status=live }}</ref> As of the 2020s, additional renewed efforts were introduced to preserve the local Cantonese language and culture with some limited Cantonese language classes now being taught in some schools as well as hosting Cantonese appreciation cultural events along with hosting activities that cater to the local Cantonese culture and language as well as many local Cantonese speaking families are now placing much stronger emphasis on their children to speak Cantonese to preserve the culture and language. In a 2018 report study by Shan Yunming and Li Sheng, the report showed that 90% of people living in Guangzhou are bilingual in both Cantonese and Mandarin, though fluency will vary depending on if they are locally born to the city and the surrounding Guangdong province or migrants from other provinces, which shows how much importance the Cantonese language still has in the city despite the strict policy rules from the government to be using Mandarin as the country's official language.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008922/cantons-unease-as-mandarin-spreads%2C-locals-face-identity-crisis | title=Canton's Unease: As Mandarin Spreads, Locals Face Identity Crisis | date=November 10, 2021 | access-date=April 20, 2022 | archive-date=May 15, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220515121649/https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008922/cantons-unease-as-mandarin-spreads%2C-locals-face-identity-crisis | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1177/1868102620983939 | title=Today in Guangzhou, Tomorrow in Hong Kong?

Recent years have seen a huge influx of migrants, with up to 30 million additional migrants living in the Guangzhou area for at least six months out of every year with the majority being female migrants and many becoming local Guangzhou people. This huge influx of people from other areas, called the floating population, is due to the city's fast-growing economy and high labor demands. Guangzhou Mayor Wan Qingliang told an urban planning seminar that Guangzhou is facing a very serious population problem stating that, while the city had 10.33 million registered residents at the time with targets and scales of land use based on this number, the city actually had a population with migrants of nearly 15 million. According to the Guangzhou Academy of Social Sciences researcher Peng Peng, the city is almost at its maximum capacity of just 15 million, which means the city is facing a great strain, mostly due to a high population of unregistered people.<ref name="worldpopulationreview1"/>

According to the 2000 National Census, marriage is one of the top two reasons for permanent migration and is particularly important for women as 29.3% of the permanent female migrants migrate for marriage [Liang et al.,2004]. Many of the female economic migrants marry men from Guangzhou in hopes of a better life.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ouyang |first1=Jun |last2=Zhong |first2=Wei |last3=Xiao |first3=Ling |last4=Zhang |first4=Yuaner |last5=Chen |first5=Chaolong |last6=chen |first6=Chun |last7=Xia |first7=Lili |last8=Zhou |first8=Xiaofang |title=Residents' Intermarriage behavior in Guangzhou, China in Last 60 Years: Social Geographic Report |journal=Espace populations sociétés |date=December 2009 |issue=2009/3 |pages=485–495 |doi=10.4000/eps.3803 |doi-access=free }}</ref> but like elsewhere in the [[People's Republic of China]], the [[hukou system|household registration system]] (''hukou'') limits migrants' access to residences, educational institutions and other public benefits.

Historically, the Cantonese people have made up a sizable part of the 19th- and 20th-century [[Chinese diaspora]]; in fact, many [[overseas Chinese]] have ties to Guangzhou.

Demographically, the only significant immigration into China has been by [[overseas Chinese]], but Guangzhou sees many foreign tourists, workers, and residents from the [[Demographics of China#People from other immigration jurisdictions|usual locations]] such as the [[Americans in China|United States]].

*[[Cantonese opera]], usually divided into martial and literary performances.
*[[Xiguan]] (Saikwan), the area west of the former walled city.

The [[Guangzhou Opera House]] & [[Guangzhou Symphony Orchestra|Symphony Orchestra]] also perform classical Western music and Chinese compositions in their style. [[Guangdong music (genre)|Cantonese music]] is a traditional style of Chinese instrumental music, while [[Cantopop]] is the local form of [[pop music]] and [[rock-and-roll]] which developed from neighboring [[Hong Kong]].

It is worth noting that [[Cantonese language]], [[Cantonese cuisine]] and [[Cantonese opera]] are the shared culture of the whole [[Guangdong]] region, not just the important cultural components of Guangzhou city. With a population of diverse background, the culture of Guangzhou also includes other categories, such as [[Hakka]] culture and language.

In the [[Hakka people]] inhabited areas of Guangzhou, Hakka culture has been well developed and preserved, and in the long history, the integration of Canton culture and Hakka culture has derived new cultural characteristics. [[Zengcheng, Guangzhou]] is a district with a history of more than 1800 years, with the harmonious coexistence of Canton culture and Hakka culture, the derived food culture has not only the non-heritage food such as Zhengguo Wonton, Lanxi Rice Noodle, and Goose Soup, but also the special food such as Yuecun Dace Fish Skin, Paitan Roasted Chicken, and Shitan Whole Cattle Banquet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://new.qq.com/rain/a/20230331A0A7B000 |title=Foodies!

==== Taoism====
[[Taoism]] and [[Chinese folk religion]] are still represented at a few of the city's temples. Among the most important is the [[Temple of the Five Immortals (Guangzhou)|Temple of the Five Immortals]], dedicated to the  [[Xian (Taoism)|Five Immortals]] credited with introducing rice cultivation at the foundation of the city. The five rams they rode were supposed to have turned into stones upon their departure and gave the city several of its nicknames.<ref>{{citation |last=Glancey |first=Jonathan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_leHhzKlI7kC |title=Architecture |series=Eyewitness Companions |location=Attleborough |publisher=CobaltId for Dorling Kindersley |editor=Paula Regan |editor2=Debra Wolter |editor3=Louise Dick |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-7566-1732-5 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_leHhzKlI7kC&pg=PA177 177] |access-date=June 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308230138/https://books.google.com/books?id=_leHhzKlI7kC&printsec=frontcover |archive-date=March 8, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> However, the temple has not been restored as a Taoist temple status yet. Other famous temples include the [[List of City God Temples in China|City God Temple of Guangzhou]] and [[Sanyuan Palace]]. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], all Taoist temples and shrines were practically destroyed or damaged by the red guards. Only a handful of them like Sanyuan Palace were restored during the 1980s. Guangzhou, like most of southern China, is also notably observant and continues the practice of [[Chinese ancestral veneration|Chinese ancestral worship]] during major festive occasions like the [[Tomb Sweeping Festival|Qing Ming Festival]] and [[Zhong Yuan Festival]].

==== Buddhism====

The [[Buddhist missionary|Buddhist missionary monk]], [[Bodhidharma]] is traditionally said to have visited Panyu during the [[Liu Song dynasty|Liu Song]] or [[Liang dynasty]] (5th or 6th century). Around AD&nbsp;520, [[Emperor Wu of Liang|Emperor Wu]] of the [[Liang dynasty|Liang]] ordered the construction of the Baozhuangyan Temple and the Xilai Monastery to store the relics of [[Cambodia]]n [[Arahant|Buddhist saints]] which had been brought to the city and to house the monks beginning to assemble there. The Baozhuangyan is now known as the [[Temple of the Six Banyan Trees]], after a famous poem composed by [[Su Shi]] after a visit during the [[Northern Song dynasty|Northern Song]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The Xilai Monastery was renamed as the [[Hualin Temple (Guangzhou)|Hualin Temple]] ("Flowery Forest Temple") after its reconstruction during the [[Qing dynasty]].

The temples were badly damaged by both the [[Republic of China|Republican]] campaign to "Promote Education with Temple Property" ({{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|廟|產|興|學}}}}) and the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]]'s Cultural Revolution but have been renovated since the [[opening up policy|opening up]] that began in the 1980s. The Ocean Banner Temple on [[Henan Island]], once famous in the west as the only tourist spot in Guangzhou accessible to foreigners, has been reopened as the [[Hoi Tong Monastery]].

Guangzhou has two local radio stations: the provincial [[Radio Guangdong]] and the municipal Radio Guangzhou. Together they broadcast in more than a dozen channels. The primary language of both stations is [[Cantonese]]. Traditionally only one channel of Radio Guangdong is dedicated to [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]]. However, in recent years there has been an increase in Mandarin programs on most Cantonese channels. Radio stations from cities around Guangzhou mainly broadcast in Cantonese and can be received in different parts of the city, depending on the radio stations' locations and transmission power. The Beijing-based [[China National Radio]] also broadcasts Mandarin programs in the city. Radio Guangdong has a 30-minute weekly English programs, ''Guangdong Today'', which is broadcast globally through the [[WRN Broadcast|World Radio Network]]. Daily English news programs are also broadcast by Radio Guangdong.

Guangzhou has some of the most notable Chinese-language newspapers and magazines in [[mainland China]], most of which are published by three major newspaper groups in the city, the [[Guangzhou Daily]] Press Group, [[Southern Daily|Nanfang Press Corporation]], and the [[Yangcheng Evening News]] Group. The two leading newspapers of the city are ''[[Guangzhou Daily]]'' and ''[[Southern Metropolis Daily]]''. The former, with a circulation of 1.8 million, has been China's most successful newspaper for 14 years in terms of advertising revenue, while ''Southern Metropolis Daily'' is considered one of the most liberal newspapers in mainland China. In addition to Guangzhou's Chinese-language publications, there are a few English magazines and newspapers. The most successful is ''That's Guangzhou'', which started more than a decade ago and has since blossomed into ''[[That's PRD]]'', producing expatriate magazines in Beijing and Shanghai as well. It also produces ''In the Red''.
