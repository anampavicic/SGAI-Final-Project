The '''Canton of Geneva''', officially the '''Republic and Canton of Geneva''',<ref>{{Cite web |title=Page d'accueil |url=https://www.ge.ch/node/28170 |access-date=2023-11-30 |website=ge.ch |language=fr}}</ref><ref>({{langx|fr|link=no|République et canton de Genève}}; {{langx|frp|Rèpublica et canton de Geneva}}; {{langx|de|Republik und Kanton Genf}}; {{langx|it|Repubblica e Cantone di Ginevra}}; {{langx|rm|Republica e chantun Genevra}})</ref> is one of the [[Cantons of Switzerland|26 cantons]] of the [[Switzerland|Swiss Confederation]]. It is composed of forty-five [[Municipality|municipalities]], and the seat of the government and parliament is in the [[Geneva|city of Geneva]].

Geneva is the French-speaking westernmost canton of [[Switzerland]]. It lies at the western end of [[Lake Geneva]] and on both sides of the [[Rhone]], its main river. Within the country, the canton borders [[Vaud]] to the east, the only adjacent canton. However, most of Geneva's border is with France, specifically the region of [[Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes]]. As is the case in several other Swiss cantons ([[Ticino]], [[canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]], and [[canton of Jura|Jura]]), Geneva is referred to as a republic within the Swiss Confederation.

One of the most populated cantons, Geneva is considered one of the most cosmopolitan regions of the country. As a center of the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the city of Geneva has had a great influence on the canton, which essentially consists of the city and its suburbs. Notable institutions of international importance based in the canton are the [[United Nations Office at Geneva|United Nations]], the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and [[CERN]].

== History ==
{{further|History of Geneva}}
The Canton of Geneva, whose official name is the Republic and Canton of Geneva, is the successor of the Republic of Geneva.<ref>[http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F7398.php Genève (canton)], in the [[Historical Dictionary of Switzerland]]</ref>

This article focuses on the history of the canton, which begins in 1815, and some of the context leading to modern borders and events after that date. For more detail on the history of Geneva prior to that year, refer to the [[History of Geneva|history of the city of Geneva]].

=== Context ===
Compared to other urban cantons of Switzerland (Zürich, Bern, Basel before it split, Fribourg, Lucerne), Geneva's geographical size is relatively small. This article explains the political context that led to the present-day borders.

=== Early history ===
Geneva was controlled by the [[Allobroges]], a rich and powerful Celtic tribe until 121 BC, when they were defeated by the [[Roman Empire]]. The city was then annexed to the Roman Empire in 121 BC and attached to [[Gallia Narbonensis]] province. Its political importance in the region was low, but it soon developed an important economy owing to the city's port that facilitated trade over [[Lake Geneva]] from the routes joining from [[Seyssel, Haute-Savoie|Seyssel]] and [[Annecy]] towards the Roman colonies of [[Nyon]] and [[Avenches]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Caesar |first=Mathieu |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/934903870 |title=Histoire de Genève |date=2014 |publisher=Éditions Alphil-Presses |isbn=978-2-940489-93-0 |edition=2nd |location=Neuchâtel, Suisse |language=French |oclc=934903870}}</ref> The city remained part of the Empire until 443 when, welcomed by the Romans, the [[Burgundians]] settled in an ill-defined region named [[Sapaudia]] and Geneva was chosen as the capital of the newly formed kingdom for its first 20 years due to the city's economic importance as well as the prestige of its [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Geneva|Bishop]]. As the kingdom began expanding towards [[Lyon]] and [[Grenoble]], Geneva lost its central geographical location of the kingdom and for a time became a secondary capital until the kingdom was divided between [[Godegisel]] and [[Gundobad]], sons of [[Gondioc]]. Godegisel settled in Geneva from which he controlled the northern bishoprics. The nature of the political relationship between both brothers is not well known, but in the year 500 the kingdoms went to war, during which Godegisel was defeated and Geneva pillaged and destroyed.

In 532, the [[Burgundians]] were conquered by the [[Frankish Empire|Francs]], who administratively divide the area in three parts: one centred on the city of [[Besançon]], one around [[Dijon]], and the last one, the Pagus Ultraioranus ("Transjurane") includes the cities of Geneva, Nyon, Sion, and Avenches. Given the peripheral location of Geneva within this region, it lost its status of capital, although it kept a certain religious prestige.<ref name=":0" /> In 864, [[Conrad II, Duke of Transjurane Burgundy|Conrad II]] acquired the title of Duke of Transjurane and in 888 his son [[Rudolph I of Burgundy|Rudolph I]] becomes king of the second kingdom of Burgundy after seizing the opportunity of death of [[Charles the Fat]]. At its maximum extent around the year 1000, the new kingdom extends from [[Provence]] to [[Basel]] and controls the main alpine passes of the region. In this context, Geneva regains its importance as the city was located in the intersection between several important roads connecting Italy to Northern Europe via the western Alps mountain passes of [[Mont Cenis]] and [[Great St Bernard Pass]].

=== Counts of Geneva (11th–15th centuries) ===
However, by the end of the 10th century the kingdom was engulfed in several conflicts between the king's power and the aristocracy. Notably for Geneva, some of the most important nobles began to offer some lands to the Church, such as in 912 when Eldegarde (probably a Countess in an area near Nyon) gave up her lands in the area of [[Satigny]] which eventually became the Mandement, or in 962 when Queen Berthe offered lands in Saint-Genis.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Barbier |first=Claude |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/981126584 |title=Atlas historique du Pays de Genève : des Celtes au Grand Genève |date=2014 |publisher=La Salévienne |others=Pierre-François Schwarz |isbn=978-2-905922-35-9 |location=Saint-Julien-en-Genevois |oclc=981126584}}</ref> The income of the Kingdom suffered from these transfers of lands and, in an attempt to stop the process, in 995 [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|King Rudolph III]] tried to withdraw the hereditary rights away from some of his nobles. However, the King was defeated in this power struggle, and this led to a weakening of the central power. As the King weakened, some of his local officers such as the Counts rejected his authority and even opposed him. Several independent fiefdoms emerge from this time, including the [[County of Geneva]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Malgouverné Alexandre|first=Mélo Alain|author-link= |date=1986|title=Histoire du Pays de Gex, des origines à 1601|url= |location= |publisher=Gex, Intersections|isbn=}}</ref>

In 1032, [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] died without an heir. The Kingdom of Burgundy then reverted to [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|HRE Conrad II]], who tried to re-assert control of the lands by rallying the nobles who opposed Rodolph III. In exchange for his loyalty, Gerold, count of Geneva, obtained full powers over his County, becoming a direct vassal of the Emperor and so his lands became part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Malgouverné Alexandre|first=Mélo Alain|author-link= |date=1986|title=Histoire du Pays de Gex, des origines à 1601|url= |location= |publisher=Gex, Intersections|page=50|isbn=}}</ref>

However, it is not clear how the power over the city proper was shared between the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Geneva|Prince-Bishopric of Geneva]] and the counts.<ref name=":0" /> Thus, a power struggle between both ensued in which the counts received the support from the canons of the chapter, a large majority of whom were members of vassal families of the count. The apex of the count's power took place from 1078 to 1129, when Count Aymon I managed to get his brother Guy de Faucigny appointed as bishop of Geneva. Aymon took advantage of this situation by transferring the administration of some of the lands away from the Diocese of Geneva to the priory of Saint-Victor of which he became protector at the request of the Bishop, and siphoned the resources of the priory to himself.<ref name=":1" />

[[File:Map Kingdom Arelat EN.png|thumb|The County of Geneva and surrounding territories in around 1200.|295x295px]]

The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Geneva|successor]] of Guy de Faucigny, Bishop Humbert de Grammont, was outraged by this situation, and requested the restitution of the churches transferred to the administration of the Count. The outcome of the [[Gregorian Reform]] materialised in the council of Vienne of 1124 which legislated on securing the ecclesiastical rights and possessions of the church.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Vienne, Councils of (Concilium Apud Viennam Alobrogum, or Viennense) from the McClintock and Strong Biblical Cyclopedia. |url=https://www.biblicalcyclopedia.com/V/vienne-councils-of-(concilium-apud-viennam-alobrogum-or-viennense).html |access-date=2023-03-17 |website=McClintock and Strong Biblical Cyclopedia Online |language=en}}</ref> Pope [[Callixtus II]] then pressured Aymon to return the Church's estates, going as far as excommunicating him. The Count repented, and greeted the Bishop on the border of his County in Seyssel<ref>There was at this time only one Seyssel, on both banks of the [[Rhône]]. It was split in two municipalities at the [[Treaty of Turin (1760)]], the [[Seyssel, Haute-Savoie|east bank]] becoming part of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], while the [[Seyssel, Ain|west bank]] remained under French rule.</ref> as the Bishop was on his way back to Geneva from [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]], whose Bishop had been tasked by the Pope to mediate in the conflict.<ref>{{cite book |last=Duparc |first=Pierre |author-link= |date=1978 |title=Le compté de Genève, IXe–XVe siècle |url= |location= |publisher=Société d’histoire et d’archeologie|isbn=}}</ref> There, they concluded a treaty (the {{ill|Traité de Seyssel|fr|vertical-align=sup}}), whereby the Count restored to the Bishop of Geneva some of the churches whose rights and revenues he had acquired.

Although this treaty did not fully solve the conflict, which only got fully resolved by the treaty of Saint-Sigismond in 1156 which confirmed all the provisions, it marked an important step for Geneva as the count also gave up his temporal rights over the City of Geneva to the Bishop, except for the right to execute criminal sentences. The following bishops, Arducius de Faucigny (1135-1185) and Nantelme (1185-1205) kept eroding the counts' power. The touchstone of this erosion of power was the acquisition of the [[Imperial immediacy]] by the Prince-Bishopric in 1154, which designated the Bishop of Geneva as a Prince of the Empire and, by right, the only lord of the city after the Emperor,<ref name=":0" /> a status employed several times by the Bishops in the defence of their independence from local rulers. As a result, some time around 1219 the Counts of Geneva completely quit the city and moved their capital to [[Annecy]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Regat |first=Christian|author-link= |date=1999|title= Châteaux de Haute-Savoie |url= |location= |publisher= Cabèdita|isbn=}}</ref> which marked an important step for the future evolution of the canton of Geneva, as for the first time there was a complete separation of the ruling of the city of Geneva, by the Bishops, from the ruling of its hinterlands, the Counts.

At the same time, the county was in a continuous power struggle with the [[House of Savoy]], which by the middle of the 12th century governed a vast principality centred on the control of the main mountain passes of the western Alps. By the beginning of the 13th century, the Counts of Geneva were facing an alliance of the Maison de Faucigny, de Gex, as well as the counts of Savoy. After several decades of wars of the ''gebenno-faucigneran'' conflict of 1205–1250, the counts of Geneva lost all their main lands and fortresses. In the [[Treaty of Paris (1355)]], Savoy was awarded the Faucigny and Gex, leaving the counts of Geneva as secondary regional actors. After the death of antipope [[Clement VII (antipope)|count Robert]] in 1394, the county passed to the house of Thoire-Villars, who were related to the house of Geneva. However, some of the local nobility was displeased with the outcome and, profiting from the situation, the County of Geneva finally disappeared when it was sold to [[Amadeus VIII of Savoy]] for 45,000 gold francs on 5 August 1401.<ref>{{cite book |last=Demotz|first=Bernard|author-link= |date=2000|title= Le comté de Savoie du XI au XV |url= |location= |publisher= Slatkine|isbn=}}</ref>

=== House of Savoy (15th century – 1534) ===
The economic rise of cities and international commerce from the 11th century onwards also affected Geneva. Medieval fairs appeared in Northern Europe, often driven by a political will to promote a city. In contrast, the origins of the trade fairs in the city, active from at least by the middle of the 13th century, remain unknown. However, these expanded greatly during the 14th century and their apogee took place in the middle of the 15th century, when the city counted seven yearly trade fairs, four of which had large international significance: the Epiphany, Easter, August, and October/November.<ref name=":0" /> Geneva benefited from several external factors at this time to explain this economic expansion: the crisis of trade fairs in [[Chalon-sur-Saône]], and the [[Hundred Years' War]], partially removed France from international routes linking Northern Europe to Mediterranean ports such as [[Montpellier]] and [[Marseille]], which shifted eastwards, crossing Geneva and the Rhone valley; the city reaped the benefits from the ''pax sabauda'', a long-period of peace during which it was spared from the effects of wars; and in addition, the House of Savoy spent long periods of time in the city, adding to the demand for luxury goods. The trade fairs required credit to function through [[Letter of credit|letters of credit]], the development of which adds to the economic expansion of the city.<ref name="Kuntz 2019">{{Cite book |last=Kuntz |first=Joëlle |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1127276603 |title=Genève, une place financière : histoire d'un défi (XIXe-XXIe siècle) |date=2019 |isbn=978-2-8321-0941-0 |location=Genève |oclc=1127276603}}</ref> The fairs were also the spark that began the approachment of Geneva with the cities of [[Fribourg]] and [[Bern]], both of which partly depended upon the fairs for their extensive textiles manufacturing.<ref name=":0" />

This economic development and the centuries-long peace enjoyed by the city is reflected on its demographic expansion. The city grew from about 2,000 inhabitants by the end of the [[Black Death]], to 11,000 by the middle of the 15th century, making it the largest city in the region as [[Chambéry]] and [[Lausanne]] counted 5,000 inhabitants at the time and in modern Switzerland only Basel with its 8,000-to- 10,000 came close to Geneva's size.<ref name=":0" />

This explains the interest that the Dukes of Savoy took again to gain control of the city over the Bishops of Geneva upon their acquisition of the title of Counts of Geneva. On two occasions, in 1407 and again in 1420, [[Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy|Amadeus VIII]], attempted to gain control of the city from the Bishops by pleading to the Pope. However, both times his requests were rejected.<ref name=":1" /> Possibly from the lack of interest by the local population who saw no benefit in replacing the Bishop's control with the Duke, since the Bishop shared his ruling of the city with local civilian authorities.<ref name=":0" /> In 1434, however, the Duke abdicated and retreated to a chapel. This added to his prestige as a wise ruler, and he managed to get elected as antipope [[Felix V]] in 1439. When Bishop François de Metz died in 1444, Amadeus, now anti-pope, became the administrator of the bishopric and became ''de facto'', but not ''de jure'', ruler of the city.<ref name=":1" /> When he finally renounced his position as Pope, he kept a degree of control over the city, and succeeded in agreeing with [[Pope Nicholas V]] that the future Bishops of Geneva must be designated by the house of Savoy, but without gaining full control over the city.<ref name=":0" />

Nevertheless, larger events began to catch up with the city. In 1462, [[Louis XI]], king of France, decided to forbid Frenchmen and foreigners in his kingdom from attending Geneva's trade fairs, and promoted its most direct competition in [[Lyon]], whose trade fairs began in 1420. This led to an economic decline of the city, which received support from its trade partners, Bern and Fribourg, in view of defending the city's interests in the French court.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Biolzi |first=Roberto |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/495193841 |title="Avec le fer et la flamme": la guerre entre la Savoie et Fribourg (1447-1448) |date=2009 |isbn=978-2-940110-62-9 |location=Lausanne |oclc=495193841}}</ref> Trade with the central cities of the Swiss confederation sparked an economy recovery from 1480 to 1520, but it also showed the decline of Savoy as the protector of Geneva.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Van Berchem |first=Victor |date=1920 |title=Genève et les Suisses au XVe siècle.

Geneva was on the losing side since its Bishop, Jean-Louis de Savoie, had sided with Burgundy following directions from [[Yolande of Valois]], regent of Savoy. Immediately, the confederate troops invaded [[Vaud]], and Bernese troops threatened to conquer Geneva, which, owing to its status as a protected enclave within Savoy, had no standing army of its own. The treaty of Morges in 1477 put a stop to the troops advance in exchange for a ransom of 28,000 [[écu]]s of Savoy.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Berchem |first=Victor vam |title=Genève et les Suisses au XVe siècle.

The Duchy recovered most of its possessions lost to Bern in exchange for payments, but this period marked the beginning of the end of its hegemony over the Genevan region and the start of an unstable time for the city. The right to appoint the Bishop of Geneva granted to Amadeus III was eroded and it became a political and diplomatic negotiation, between Savoy, the Swiss, the chapel of the cathedral, and the civil authorities of the city.<ref name=":0" /> The decline of the Duchy was exacerbated by the internal rebellions and the series of weak and physically ill Dukes. Sensing this weakness, the Duchy's neighbours made it into a prey, incapable as well of defending Geneva's economic interests against French interference as well as incapable of physically protecting the city against foreign invasions. With this loss of reputation, new factions emerge in the city seeking to distance the city from the Duchy.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bonivard |first=François |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48267998 |title=Chroniques de Genève |date=2001–2014 |publisher=Droz |others=Micheline Tripet |isbn=978-2-600-00619-4 |location=Genève |oclc=48267998}}</ref>[[File:Karte Stadtstaat Bern Wachstum.png|thumb|Territories acquired by Bern from Savoie, 1339-1798]]The degradation of the political relations between Savoy and the civil authorities of Geneva rose to prominence in 1513, when upon the death of Bishop Charles de Seyssel, [[Charles III, Duke of Savoy|Charles III]] maneuvred to get Jean de Savoie appointed by the Pope. Several Genevan citizens who disapproved the influence of the Duke, led by [[Besançon Hugues]] and [[Philibert Berthelier (Geneva patriot)|Philibert Berthelier]], form the faction of the ''Eidguenots'' (named after the German ''Eidgenossen'', "confederates"), and sought the rapprochement of the city with the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss confederation]].<ref name=":0" /> However, part of the Genevan political elite maintained their preference for the precarious political equilibrium with the House of Savoy, partly to stay in good terms with the rulers of all of Geneva's surroundings. As a sign of contempt, the ''Eidguenots'' named this faction the ''Mammelus'', after the [[Mamluk]]s, the slave-soldiers of the sultan in Cairo.<ref name=":0" />

In 1519, the ''Eidguenots'' attempted to conclude a treaty of alliance (''combourgeoisie'') with the Swiss confederation, but this was rejected by all the cantons except for Fribourg.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last=Naef |first=Henri |title=Fribourg au secours de Genève: 1525-1526 |publisher=Fragnière |year=1927 |location=Fribourg}}</ref> Bern in particular was an ally of Savoy at this time, and central Swiss cantons viewed with suspicion an eventual expansion to the west. Upon their return to Geneva, Charles II, supported by the Bishop, attempts to destroy this faction and executed several ''Eidguenots'', including [[Philibert Berthelier (Geneva patriot)|Philibert Berthelier]] in 1519 and Amé Lévrier in 1524, accused of plotting against the Bishop.

The ''Eidguenots'' took refuge in Fribourg after the death of Amé Lévrier and, in 1525, successfully negotiated an alliance with the confederates that this time included Bern in addition to Fribourg.<ref name=":2" /> The changing attitude of Bern was explained by the decision of the successor of Charles II, [[Charles III, Duke of Savoy|Charles III]], to side with HRE [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in his conflict with [[Francis I of France]], with whom the Swiss had allied themselves and signed the [[Perpetual Peace (1516)|Perpetual Peace]] after the [[Battle of Marignano]].<ref name=":0" /> Upon the return to Geneva of the ''Eidguenots'', the government ratified the treaty of alliance on 25 February 1526, despite the protestations of the ''Mammelus'' and Bishop Pierre de la Baume. When the ''Eidguenots'' took over the control of the city, they executed the leaders of the opposing faction in retaliation for the previous ruthless behaviour of the Duke. In an attempt to regain his influence, Bishop Pierre de la Baume requested to join the alliance with Bern and Fribourg, which refused.<ref name=":0" /> Afraid for his safety, he quit the city on 1 August 1527 and he would only go back for two weeks before permanently leaving Geneva in 1533.

Despite its newly regained independence from the influence of Savoy, Geneva had no real army of its own and remained a city largely dependent on the diplomatic circumstances of the large European powers.

However, the supporters of [[Charles III, Duke of Savoy|Charles III]] did not give up in their quest to seize Geneva. They withdrew to the [[Vaud|Pays de Vaud]] from where they plotted against Geneva under the banner of "''Gentilshommes de la Cuiller''". Discreetly supported by the Duke, they harassed the city by confiscating food products in its borders, attacking men and ravaging the countryside. After an attempt to assault the city in March 1529 and again in October 1530, Geneva requested the aid of its allies from [[Canton of Bern|Bern]] and [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]]. Several thousand soldiers, accompanied by negotiators from eight Swiss cantons, entered the city on the 10th of October and stayed for ten days within its walls until the signature of a treaty with Savoy, whereby the Duke abandoned his attacks on the city and re-established the right to trade. Apart from the financial consequences on Geneva, which had to pay for the Swiss soldiers, this intervention left deep marks in the city with consequences for its future.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |last=Walker |first=Corinne |title=Histoire de Genève, de la cité de Calvin à la ville Française (1530-1813) |publisher=Alphil-Presses |year=2002 |location=Neuchâtel |language=French}}</ref>

At the time of the alliance with the confederates in 1525, few Protestants were in Geneva. [[Canton of Bern|Bern]], however, had converted to [[Protestantism in Switzerland|Protestantism]] two years before its intervention in 1530. Bernese troops displayed a brutal conviction in their new faith by destroying images, statues, and other objects of worship. The troops quickly spread Protestant ideas, and in 1532, supported by Bern, [[Guillaume Farel]] arrived at the city to preach the new faith.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Naef |first=Henri |title=Les origines de la Réforme à Genève, 2 vol |publisher=Jullien |year=1936 |location=Genève}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the authorities had been reforming the governing bodies of the city. In 1526, they set up a [[Council of Two Hundred]], emulating the Swiss model. In 1528, the right to appoint the 4 mayors ("''syndics''") was granted to the Council of Two Hundred, which also received, from 1530, the task to appoint the members of the Little Council (between 12 and 20 magistrates led by the 4 mayors), which itself appoints the members of the Council of Two Hundred. This circular election system characterised the government system of Geneva until 1792. So it is that when in 1533 the Bishop Pierre de la Baume arrived to Geneva to exercise his right of justice on the murder of a canon, he expressed his opposition to the new Councils by leaving the city forever.<ref name=":3" /> He then sides with [[Charles III, Duke of Savoy|Charles III]], and in August 1534, he excommunicates the city. In response, the city authorities declare in October of the same year the vacancy of the Bishopric and attribute for themselves all seigniorial rights (to make laws, to declare war and peace, to mint coin etc.). This act of independence marks the birth of the Republic of Geneva,<ref>{{cite book |last=Guichonnet |first=Paul |url= |title=Histoire de Genève |date=1974 |publisher=Privat, Payot |isbn= |location= |author-link=}}</ref> then still mostly confined to the city and the few medieval territories gifted to the Bishops, the largest of which were [[Satigny]], Peney, and an area around modern-day [[Jussy, Switzerland|Jussy]].

In addition, owing to the increased rate of conversions to Protestantism, on the 21{{nbsp}}May 1536, the General Council of Geneva fully adopted the reformation and confiscated all the assets of the Catholic Church. With this decision, the commune of Geneva, the civil authority of the city, merged with new institutions, including the territories that depended on the Bishop, the ''mandements''. As a response, the catholic canton of Fribourg breaks its alliance with the city.

[[Charles III, Duke of Savoy|Charles III]] took advantage of the tumultuous situation in Geneva to attempt to conquer the city in 1535–36,<ref name="Paas67">John Roger Paas, ''The German Political Broadsheet, 1600–1700: 1600–1615'', (Otto Harrassowitz, 1985), 67.</ref> but coming to the aid of Geneva, a new army of Bernese in alliance with France defeated Savoy. It occupied the lands of Savoy in the Genevan basin (including all the [[Pays de Gex]]),<ref>{{cite book |last=Guichonnet |first=Paul |url= |title=Histoire de la Savoie |date=1974 |publisher=Privat |isbn= |location= |author-link=}}</ref> marking the end of the [[Duchy of Savoy|Duchy]] as a threat to Geneva and the recognition of Geneva's sovereignty. This was not without risk to Geneva, given how Bernese troops conquered [[Lausanne]] despite the cities' alliance.

In 1536, [[John Calvin]], a then 26-year old French [[theologist]], spent some time in summer in Geneva and was convinced by [[William Farel]] to stay and establish together a new Church. In January 1537 they presented their project to the mayors. They were initially reluctant to adopt Farel and Calvin's ideas of a Church that would take again control over the city, and were also displeased by both men's refusal to adopt some of the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] liturgy. In April 1538, as the government is torn between supporters of a state religion following the Bernese model and supporters of French reformation, the authorities ask both men to leave the city. However, soon after in September 1541, Calvin is asked by Geneva to return. Upon his arrival he begins to leave his mark on Church with the [[Ordinance (canon law)|Ecclesiastical Ordinances]]<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Calvin |first1=Jean (1509-1564) Auteur du texte |url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5478956v |title=Les ordonnances ecclésiastiques de l'église de Genève .

These two texts, revised over time, would govern the Republic until the end of the 18th century.

If the political Edicts brought only minor changes to prior dispositions adopted over the previous decades, the Ecclesiastical Ordinances would revolutionise the organisation of religious institutions. Thus, the creation of the Consistory launches the period that some historians call the "regime of moral terror"<ref name=":3" /> with numerous prohibitions that were severely applied, such as in the sentencing to the pyre of theologian and doctor [[Michael Servetus]] in 1553 for heresy, or the marginalisation of ancient, pro-Bernese and anti-French bourgeois families in 1555. The removal of this last opposition, marked the end of Geneva's distinctive identity founded on the memory of the fights for independence and conviviality practices that Calvin could not tolerate.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/471028004 |title=Calvin et le calvinisme : cinq siècles d'influences sur l'Église et la société |date=2008 |publisher=Labor et fides |others=Martin Ernst, ...

Internationally, thanks to Calvin's religious reforms, Geneva becomes a beacon for the reformation, attracting thousands of Protestant refugees from all over Europe, but especially from France and to a lesser extent Italy and Spain. With the influx of refugees, the population grew from 10,000 residents in 1550 to 25,000 in 1560. However, many of the new arrivals did not want or could not relocate permanently, and the population stabilised around 14,000 by 1572.<ref name=":3" /> Like in other cities in the Swiss landscape, the rights to live in the city was highly organised as follows:<ref>{{Cite book |last=Walter |first=François |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/718075339 |title=Histoire de la Suisse |date=2009–2010 |publisher=Editions Alphil - Presses universitaires suisses |isbn=978-2-940235-49-0 |location=Neuchâtel |oclc=718075339}}</ref>

* ''Habitant'' (resident): those with the right to live in the Geneva, to acquire goods and to practice all trades except [[liberal profession]]s;
* The children of habitants were ''natifs'' (natives), with limited economic and political rights;
* Bourgeois, the sole status that conferred the political rights to participate in the ''conseil général'', and be eligible for the Council of Two-Hundred. The right to become bourgeois had to be granted by the council, in addition to having to buy the letter of Bourgeoisie, which would fetch for 50 to 100 florins in the second half of the 16th century and jump to over 8,000 florins by the mid-18th century;<ref name=":3" />
* ''Citoyens'' (citizens), the children of bourgeois if they were born in the city.

In an effort to attract talent, from 1537 the Republic granted the status of bourgeois cheaply to teachers, doctors, musicians, to the stonemasons who contributed to the construction of the new fortifications, and even for free to jurists, priests, professors, and schoolmasters. The main impacts on the city from the refugees that were therefore attracted would be cultural with the influence of the [[French language|French]] language that would gradually replace the local [[Franco-Provençal]] language, and economic. Initially this opening to foreigners would attract professions that served the local economy such as stonemasons, tailors, shoemakers, or carpenters. But from the 1550s, thanks to the skills brought for the refugees the economy developed export industries such as fabrics and printing.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rihs |first=Guillaume |date=2010 |title=Les nouveaux bourgeois de Genève au temps du Premier refuge (1536-1584) |url=https://www.shag-geneve.ch/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/OUTILS1_bshag_no40_120504.pdf |journal=Bulletin de la SHAG |issue=40}}</ref> Printing in particular grew very fast, with the arrival of famous printers such as [[Jean Crespin]] or [[Robert Estienne]], employing over 200 workers during Calvin's time before many of the printers moved to Lyon when that city also became for a time Protestant.<ref name=":3" /> In the second half of the century, other industries develop, notably gilding and watchmaking.

After the defeat of [[Charles III, Duke of Savoy|Charles III]] by French and Bernese forces, Savoy had temporarily given up on its efforts to take Geneva. However, in the second half of the 16th century the Dukedom allies with Spain and regains some of its power. The son of Charles III, [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy|Emmanuel Philibert]], defeated the army of French king [[Henri II of France|Henri II]] in the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|battle of Saint-Quentin]] in 1557 and recovered the lands conquered by the French in 1535. In 1559, in the [[Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis (1559)|Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis]], France restores an independent Savoy. However, Bern did not participate in the initial negotiations, and only in the [[Savoy#Duchy of Savoy|Treaty of Lausanne of 1564]] did Savoy recover the lands around Geneva, while losing forever the [[Pays de Vaud]] to Bern. Until his death, Emmanuel-Philibert practiced tolerance with his non-Catholic subjects and largely respected the "{{lang|la|cujus regio, ejus religio}}" principle for Geneva. However, the Genevan authorities were highly suspicious and worked towards obtaining the support of catholic [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]] and France, who agree to protect the city against potential attacks from Savoy.

In effect, the threats to the city materialise with Emmanuel-Philibert's son, [[Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy|Charles Emmanuel I]], who dreams of conquering the city and he begins plotting against Protestants, employing mercenaries to intimidate those converted by Bernese preachers. Intensifying its diplomatic efforts, Geneva obtains the alliance with [[Canton of Zürich|Zürich]] in 1584.

Between 1586 and 1587 large outbreaks of the plague affects Geneva and Savoy, which came coupled with bad harvests and famines affecting the continent. In these conditions, it was difficult to supply with food the 15,000 inhabitants of the city, despite diplomatic efforts to seek help from its allies. The Council forbids the production of white bread and pastries and bans some residents from the city. The catastrophe affected Savoy equally, and in response Charles Emmanuel I forbids the export of grains from his lands, which in essence means blockading Geneva from any supplies since the city was surrounded by the Duchy except for what goods could be imported by the lake.<ref name=":3" />

In response, Geneva, supported by France and a contingent of 12,000 Swiss soldiers, intermittently occupied the Pays de Gex from 1589, but the city was finally forced to abandon it when France defeated Savoy and annexed the Pays de Gex for itself in the [[Treaty of Lyon (1601)|Treaty of Lyon of 1601]]. This marked the point where most of Geneva's hinterland was divided between two different strong states along the Rhone banks: the Kingdom of France on the right, and the Duchy of Savoy on the left.

[[File:Escalade-battle-2.jpg|thumb|{{lang|fr|[[L'Escalade]]}}, the last attempt by Savoy to take Geneva by force, 1602]]

This event and the prior domination of the area by Savoy and the Counts of Geneva, largely explains why, unlike other Swiss urban cantons, Geneva was unable to expand geographically, as its borders were dominated by those two powerful states.

Unwilling to give up on the city, Savoy launched one last attempt to conquer the city during the events of the [[L'Escalade|Escalade]] in 1602. This incursion against the “Protestant Rome” would paradoxically lead to the recognition of the city's independence.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nicollier-de Weck |first=Béatrice |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/401666499 |title=Comprendre l'Escalade : essai de géopolitique genevoise |date=2002 |publisher=Labor et Fides |others=Olivier Fatio |isbn=2-8309-1065-6 |location=Genève |oclc=401666499}}</ref> The negotiations between Savoy and Geneva from spring 1603 were successfully completed in July the same year with the treaty of Saint-Julien.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2002-12-12 |title=1603, an de paix plus précieux que 1602 |language=fr |work=Le Temps |url=https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/1603-an-paix-plus-precieux-1602 |access-date=2023-04-26 |issn=1423-3967}}</ref> Thanks to the arbitration provided by several Swiss cantons as well as France, the Republic obtained a very advantageous deal that politically placed the city in equal terms with Savoy. In addition, it obtained economic (free commerce and exemption from taxes on real estate located in Savoy owned by Genevan residents) and military rights (prohibition from building any military facilities and from keeping any garrison on a 15-km radius around the city), that would guarantee the city's independence and prosperity. In addition, Geneva also obtained an annual subsidy from France, and a permanent garrison funded by the Kingdom.<ref name=":3" />

[[File:Genève - btv1b53152762r (1 of 2).jpg|thumb|Geneva's fortifications by mid-17th century]]

Since then, both Savoy and France largely respected Geneva's independence, protected by its strong fortresses, and guaranteed by its alliance with the Protestant cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy of [[Zürich]] and [[Bern]]. Nevertheless, the threats to the Republic's existence did not disappear, particularly as France switched its European alliances and the Kings became less tolerant of Protestants. Threatened by these changing winds and traumatised by the events of the Escalade, Geneva enlarged and professionalised its permanent garrison (from 300 soldiers in 1603 to over 700 a century later) and fortified itself behind mighty walls that become increasingly claustrophobic as the lands in [[Chablais]] and the [[Pays de Gex]] were progressively converted back to Catholicism by the future Bishop [[Francis de Sales|St François de Sales]] from 1594, who even entered the city de incognito in an attempt to convince [[Theodore de Beze]] to hold a public debate on religion.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book |last=Brandli |first=Fabrice |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1235822786 |title=Nain et le Géant La République de Genève et la France au XVIIIe siècle.

Playing now on the defensive, the Republic multiplied the number of population surveys to track poor Catholics and beggars, while it was forced to accept in 1679 by king [[Louis XIV]] the presence of a permanent representative who demanded to be allowed to celebrate the Catholic mass in his home for his workers and neighbours, dealing a blow to the city's religious purity,<ref name=":3" /> particularly because the first representative, Laurent de Chavingy was very provocative.

In 1681, as France annexed [[Strassbourg|Strasbourg]], Geneva fears for the worst and the councils must skilfully navigate the diplomatic situation to safeguard the Republic's independence. The major advantages that the councillors had for this task were on the one hand the strategic position of the city, as France was interested in keeping the status quo with Savoy as well as in respecting Geneva's alliance with the Swiss cantons in order to maintain the supply of Swiss mercenaries,<ref name=":4" /> and on the other hand economic interests given that the city was centrally located in the trade routes linking north and south, and that it provided a significant amount of capital to finance France's debt.<ref name="Kuntz 2019"/> Tensions were highest during the [[Huguenots|1685 second wave of Huguenot refugees]] forced into exile after the [[Edict of Fontainebleau|revocation of the Nantes edict]] since Geneva was a favored passage for the refugees heading to Switzerland and historians estimate that between 100,000 and 120,000 huguenots transited through the city.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Jérôme Sautier, Louise Martin, Olivier Fatio, Liliane Mottu-Weber, Michel Grandjean, Cécile Holtz |date=1985 |title=Genève au temps de la Révocation de l'Édit de Nantes, 1680-1705 |journal=Société d'Histoire et d'Archéologie de Genève |volume=50}}</ref> Buoyed by the economic prosperity and relative peace between 1654 and 1688, when France went to [[Nine Years' War|war against the league of Augsburg]] and blockaded its enemies, Geneva provided much aid to the refugees, some of whom permanently moved to the city and helped to develop new industries such as indiennes and contributed to the watchmaking industry, displeasing France in the process.[[File:Old Confederacy 18th centur.png|thumb|The cantons and allies of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] in the 18th century. Geneva is a group of small territories in the southwest.]] No major changes occurred in Geneva's borders until 1749. In an effort to rationalise the borders marked by the medieval territories gifted to the Bishops in the Middle Ages, the Republic and France exchanged territories in that year: Geneva swapped its rights over [[Challex]], [[Thoiry, Ain|Thoiry]], Fenières, and some enclaves it possed in the Pays de Gex, for [[Chancy]], [[Avully]], and [[Russin]]. In a similar treaty with Savoy in 1754, Geneva received from Savoy [[Cartigny, Geneva|Cartigny]], [[Jussy, Switzerland|Jussy]], [[Vandoeuvres]], [[Gy, Switzerland|Gy]], and some other smaller territories, in exchange for its rights on [[Carouge]], [[Veyrier]], [[Onex, Switzerland|Onex]], [[Lancy]], [[Bossey]], [[Presinge]], and others. During the baroque and classical periods, Europe saw the emergence of several planned towns. Save for the reconstruction of towns destroyed by fires (such as Schwyz in 1642, Sion in 1788, or La Chaux-de-Fonds in 1794), Switzerland did not jump on this trend mostly circumscribed to the large monarchies and princely states. However, the desire to possess or weaken Geneva by France and Savoy provides two good examples of this urban planning, both of which are now Genevan towns. In the 18th century under [[Louis XV]], France intended to build a large port city in [[Versoix]] to deviate the traffic en route to Lake Geneva and from there to the Swiss confederation. The city, intended for around 30,000 inhabitants, would have been bigger than Geneva (by then the largest Swiss city) and included large squares and ports. [[Voltaire]], who had settled in [[Ferney]], was particularly rejoiced about the idea of ruining Geneva. However, opposition from Bern to a new fortified town in its border in Pays de Gex, and budgetary problems in France, finally stopped the project of which few items finally were built and survive. A more lasting project was launched by Savoy in 1777, which transformed [[Carouge]] into the gateway to the northern provinces and conferred the village the status of city in 1786. The planned city was particularly innovative in the way that streets were symmetrically laid and by the total absence of fortifications.<ref>{{cite book |last=Walter |first=François |url= |title=Histoire de la Suisse, Le temps des révolutions (1750–1830) |date=2010 |publisher=Éditions Alphil |isbn= |location= |author-link=}}</ref>

[[File:Geneva civitas Bastions.jpg|thumb|Detail of the Parc des Bastions in 1752, in a map ordered by [[Pierre Mouchon]]]]

After the aura of a highly fortified "Protestant Rome",<ref>{{Cite web |title=Geneva {{!}} History, Culture, Institutions, & Points of Interest {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Geneva-Switzerland |access-date=2023-05-05 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> came an image during the 18th century of a very wealthy, elegant city behind its walls. Except for the periods of crises from the [[Great Plague of Marseille]] and the crash of the [[John Law (economist)|John Law]] monetary system in France, the century was prosperous until 1785, driven by the production and exports of luxury goods, most notably watches. Between 1760 and 1790, the watchmaking industry employs around 4,000 workers, a third of the men residents. During the century, the government also invests in public parks, most notably the Bastions park in 1720,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Promenade des Bastions |url=https://www.geneve.ch/fr/promenade-bastions |access-date=2023-05-05 |website=www.geneve.ch |language=fr}}</ref> one of the earliest examples of a public park in Europe created from the start for the public and by the public authorities; in beautifying the city, improving the public lighting amongst others. In a latter in 1775 the writer and philosopher Georges Sulzer wrote "''Mr Bonnet was kind enough to accompany me to Geneva. It is well known that this city is, in proportion to its size, one of the richest in Europe. Its avenues already announce its opulence; everything indicates a people who live in the midst of abundance. Nowhere have I seen so many country houses as in the territory of this little Republic: the banks of the lake are entirely covered with them. These buildings all have a pleasant exterior which announces, if not magnificence, at least the last degree of cleanliness. Each house has its own well-tended gardens, often even vineyards, meadows and ploughed land. The main road was swarming with pedestrians, horses and carriages, and the surroundings were as busy as they are elsewhere on days of great solemnity''".<ref name=":3" />

At the same time, political troubles were brewing. In 1526 as the Republic institutions were created, most of the power was given to the [[Council of Two Hundred]]. However, the Little Council had little by little nibbled its power, the Republic having effectively surrendered the power to the small number of bourgeois who controlled the Little Council. In 1707 the lawyer and member of the Council of Two Hundred [[Pierre Fatio]] was executed for his attempt to cut back on the powers of the Little Council, by leading a new faction called the ''representatives'' that called for a greater share of powers between the two councils''.'' In addition, owing to increased demographic growth and an increase in the price of ''bourgeoisie'', the proportion of eligible men eligible to the governing councils fell from 28% in 1730 to 18% in 1772, as the majority of the population were then ''natives'' and ''residents,'' many of whom were educated traders or craftsmen who increasingly rejected being excluded from politics. Increased realisation of their weight, and supported by [[Voltaire]], the natives joined forces with the faction of ''representatives'' to overthrow the councils in April 1782 and start a revolution that would facilitate the acquisition of bourgeois rights by the natives. However, only three months later, Bernese, French, and Savoy troops entered the city to re-appoint the ancient government and undo the reforms.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Candaux |first=Jean-Daniel |title=La révolution genevoise de 1782: un état de la question |publisher=Bruxelles : Université, Groupe d'étude du XVIIIe siècle |year=1980 |location=Bruxelles |language=French}}</ref>

In 1785, economic crisis hits Geneva, driven first by the protectionist policies and financial crisis of France and Germany, which reduce the demand for the luxurious Genevan timepieces. After a difficult winter in 1788–89, riots over the increasing price of bread break in Saint-Gervais and spread to the rest of the city. Concerned by an escalation of the revolts, the government implemented several reforms to appease the population, including the grant of citizenship to ''natives'' and residents of the countryside villages.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Golay |first=Éric |date=2001 |title=Quand le peuple devint roi.

However, in 1792 the [[French Revolution]] reached Geneva when the revolutionaries take over Savoy in September of that year. The Genevan government received military support from its Swiss allies, but they quickly withdrew from the city in exchange for an assurance of the respect of their neutrality by France. On the 19 November 1792 the [[National Convention]] declared the Edict of Fraternity which called on European peoples to rise against their rulers, both secular and spiritual, and overthrow them; in response, the Genevan government decided to grant on the day of the Escalade, the 12th of December, full rights to all the inhabitants of the city and its towns.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22387321 |title=Révolutions genevoises : 1782-1798. |date=1989 |publisher=Maison Tavel |others=Maison Tavel |isbn=2-8306-0062-2 |location=Genève |oclc=22387321}}</ref> However, this was too late and on the 28th of the same month, a new revolt spreads in the city and the old patrician government falls, replaced by a new regime that on the day after adopts the motto of "''Liberté, Égalité, Indépendence''" French for "Liberty, Equality, Independence", stressing the fact that despite its revolutionary principles, the citizens of Geneva opposed any measure that would surrender the city's independence in a period when the threat of France was not subsiding.<ref name=":3" /> A period of political and economic crisis and instability followed, with a new constitution adopted in 1794 and several government changes that adopt increasingly radical and controversial ideas such as vastly higher wealth tax rates for citizens of opposing factions, and death and imprisonment sentences for hundreds of adversaries.

Meanwhile, in France, [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] fell 27 July 1794 and with him the [[Reign of Terror]]. Slowly, stability regains Geneva and in September 1795 with the 'act of forgetfulness' all the trials in the revolutionary courts were annulled. Old symbols of the Republic of Geneva make a comeback, and in October 1796 a new, more conservative constitution, is adopted.<ref name=":5" />

Things would quickly evolve when France officially annexes Savoy in the spring 1796 and Geneva is increasingly denounced by Paris as a "''den of contrabandists, aristocrats, and emigrants''". In January 1798, the French army invades the Swiss confederation and begins a trade embargo on Geneva, but the Directory wishes to annex the city on demand by its citizens and not by force. The wish would be granted on 15 April 1798 when the Genevan government is coerced by economic and political pressure to request the annexation by France.<ref name=":3" /> The treaty was relatively favourable to Geneva, whose citizens preserved the assets of the Republic, are left alone in regards to education and the economy, and granted a 5-year exemption from conscription.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mottu-Weber |first=Liliane |title=Dans Genève annexée au département du Léman (1798-1813) |publisher=Cahiers de la Faculté de Lettres |year=1997 |location=Genève |language=French}}</ref> The city's fortifications are also kept intact and preserved, and the Protestant religion is largely tolerated, although with strict conditions such as the demotion of its status to a simple association.

[[File:Karte-Departement-Léman-1798.png|thumb|Map of the French département of Léman established in 1798]]

After long debates in Paris, Geneva is then made capital of a new {{lang|fr|[[Léman (department)|département du Léman]]}}, which resembled the old catholic diocese of Geneva prior to the Protestant reformation.

The Napoleonic army left Geneva on 30 December 1813, and on the next day the return of the Republic ({{lang|fr|Restauration de la République}}) was proclaimed.

=== Modern history ===
Geographically, the city and canton had been advantaged in the Middle Ages by its position as a crossroads between France, Savoy and Italy with Northern Europe, via the mountain passes and Lake Geneva (see previous section). However, this advantage evaporated with the construction of the railways. The first railway to link the city, built by the [[Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée|Paris-Lyon-Méditerranée]] (PLM) linked [[Lyon–Geneva railway|Geneva to Lyon]] in 1858, followed soon after during the same year by the [[Lausanne-Geneva railway|Geneva to Lausanne]] railway line operated by the [[West Switzerland Company]]. This provided a basic link between France ([[Lyon]]) and Switzerland ([[Lausanne]]), but in order to complete the role of a crossroad the network required a north-south connection, linking [[Annecy]] to [[Genève-Cornavin railway station|Geneva]].

The [[Victor Emmanuel Railway]] showed interest in this link. [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Camillo Benso]], prime minister of the Sardinian government, claimed that if the railways did not penetrate the [[Faucigny]] and [[Chablais]], those territories "''will be more detached from the rest of Savoy than Sardinia is from the rest of the continental provinces [of Italy].

The original citation read: "''elegant Geneva and the Savoyard maid examine in the shrouded horizon the railway connection between Geneva and Savoy... Geneva... Anne!... Anne... sister Anne!... do you see anything coming?''"]]

Another missed opportunity for Geneva to keep its central position came with the [[Simplon Tunnel|Simplon tunnel]]. Geneva had entertained the idea to build a tunnel through the [[Col de la Faucille]] in [[Arrondissement of Gex|Gex]], linking the canton to [[Saint-Jean-de-Losne]] in [[Burgundy]] on the Paris-Lyon axis, avoiding Lyon. In 1874 Geneva's government submitted a proposal for this project, complemented in 1886 by the project to link the canton to Gex and [[Morez]] and [[Saint-Julien-en-Genevois]] and Annecy, which would have transformed the city into a real railway hub.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rouiller |first=Jean-Frédéric |title=Un problème centenaire: La construction des chemins de fer de la région genevoise et leur raccordement. |publisher=Genève, Editions Feuillets Universitaires |year=1947 |location=Geneva |language=French}}</ref> The start of the construction of the Simplon tunnel in 1896 encouraged Geneva to push for this project, and suggested again the construction of a tunnel under the Col de la Faucille to provide a shorter connection between France and Italy than the existing links via the [[Fréjus Rail Tunnel|Fréjus tunnel]] and the [[Gotthard Tunnel|Gotthard tunnel]]. Both France and other western cantons showed great interest in the idea. Alas, the [[Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée|PLM]] chose instead a route via the tunnel of [[Vallorbe railway station|Mont d'Or]] to link France to the Simplon tunnel via Lausanne and the Rhône valley in Valais, inaugurated in 1915.<ref name=":7" /> The hopes for a railway tunnel under Mont Blanc, which would have led to an increase in rail traffic through Geneva, were also stopped by the commencement of [[World War I]], and by the time that this tunnel was finally completed after the second world war, it had turned into a [[Mont Blanc Tunnel|road tunnel]] instead.<ref name=":7" />

A small stretch of railway was built between [[Annemasse]] and [[Genève-Eaux-Vives railway station|Eaux-Vives]], but this station would be left unconnected to the rest of the Swiss network despite the agreement by the Swiss confederation to complete [[CEVA rail|the missing link]] between that station and Geneva's central station in Cornavin in 1912.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Vuilleumier |first=Christophe |title=Du CEVA au Léman Express |publisher=Slatkine |year=2020 |isbn=978-2-8321-0977-9 |location=Geneva |language=French}}</ref> Although the link between Cornavin and Eaux-Vives was finally completed in 2019, leading to the creation of the [[Léman Express]] suburban rail network, it is not intended for freight transport. Additionally, the south line between Annemasse and Valais that provided a shorter path to the Simplon tunnel from Geneva (the ‘[[Saint-Gingolph–Saint-Maurice railway|Tonkin line]]’), was eventually closed between Evian-les-Bains and Saint-Gingolph to passenger traffic in 1937 and to all traffic in 1988.

As a consequence of all these decisions, although freight traffic exists towards the industrial areas of La Praille, Vernier, and Meyrin, the main marshalling yard serving the city, [[:fr:Gare de Lausanne-Triage|Lausanne-Triage]] is located near Morges, 50&nbsp;km away from Geneva and the city never redeveloped its importance as a traffic gateway to central Europe from the Mediterranean.

Financially, the city bankers had long developed their connections and networks across Europe. In the advent of the industrial revolution the main industry of the city was watchmaking, and it had long prided itself on the craftmanship of its workers. The surplus of the abundant capital was therefore channeled by the local bankers to investments in other cities.<ref name=":9" /> Some industries managed to develop on the back of the highly skilled workforce, for example the Société Genevoise d’Instruments de Physique (SIP) established in 1860, which produced electrical equipment, and would eventually merge in 1891 with Cuenod Sautter & Cie in 1891 to form [[Société Anonyme des Ateliers de Sécheron|Ateliers Sécheron]], which produced electrical equipment and train locomotives. It was acquired by Brown Boveri Company in 1919, and today, as Sécheron Hasler, it still produces complex electrical transformers and other electrical equipment in its factory in [[Satigny]]. Chemical companies, namely [[Firmenich]] and [[Givaudan]] were established in 1895 and 1898.

Despite all these examples, due to the relative isolation of the canton, surrounded by France from 1860 and linked with a small railway network to the rest of the continent, the canton did not manage to industrially develop as quickly as better connected cities such as Zürich, which overtook Geneva as the largest city in Switzerland by population in the late 1860s.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Stadt |url=https://hls-dhs-dss.ch/articles/007875/2018-02-01/ |access-date=2023-09-17 |website=hls-dhs-dss.ch |language=de}}</ref>
 
[[File:Palace of Nations Geneva 20102014 02.jpg|thumb|269x269px|Main building of the Palace of Nations]]

The canton's fortunes would improve from 1919 when Geneva was chosen as the headquarters of the [[League of Nations]]. This led to large construction works to host the organization, including the [[Palace of Nations]] completed in 1938. After the dissolution of the organization, the new [[United Nations]] headquarters could not be located in Geneva since the new organization was to be designed with a security council capable of leading military operations, which was incompatible with the principle of Swiss neutrality.<ref name=":7" /> Instead, in 1946 an agreement was reached to locate [[United Nations Office at Geneva|the second headquarters of the organization in Geneva]], including the headquarters for its largest organisations such as the [[International Labour Organization]] (established in Geneva in 1919), the [[World Health Organization]], the [[International Telecommunication Union]], and the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (precursor to the [[World Trade Organization]]) (1948), or the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (1955) and the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (1967). The decision was aided by the good condition of the infrastructure left by the League of Nations, and [[Geneva Airport|Geneva's airport]] paved and intact runway (the only one in Switzerland at the time) in a European continent ravaged by the second world war.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Simon Bradley |first=Helen James |date=2020-05-16 |title=How Geneva Airport helped the international city take off |url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/centenary-celebration_how-geneva-airport-helped-the-international-city-take-off/45733762 |access-date=2023-09-17 |website=SWI swissinfo.ch |language=en}}</ref>

Cross border cooperation began only a century after the creation of the canton. In 1913, an agreement was sealed between Switzerland and France to build the Chancy-Pougny electric dam. Completed in 1925 to supply energy to the steel mills in Creusot, it began to supply electricity to the [[Services Industriels de Genève]] by 1958.

Cross-border working movements had existed in Geneva since the Middle Ages and the city was traditionally more open to immigration than others. Around the year 1700, Swiss cities and their allies such as Geneva, had two types of residents: the bourgeois, who held political rights (and a minority of whom formed the patrician class), and the inhabitants, who had no say in the ruling of the city. Amongst the latter, there were the 'established', who had full residence permits, and the 'tolerated' with time-limited permits. The proportion of bourgeois over the total residents in Basle was 70% in 1795; 61% in Zürich in 1780, and 26% in Geneva in 1781. The proportion of 'inhabitants' in Zürich in 1795 was of 8%, whereas in Geneva, a more liberal city, it was 46% in 1764.<ref>{{cite book |last=Walter|first=François|author-link= |date=2015|title=Histoire de la Suisse (l'âge classique)|url= |location= |publisher=Éditions Alphil|page=106|isbn=}}</ref> Note that the remaining residents were 'foreigners', people from other villages and cities.

Building on the liberal roots, in 1882 a convention allowed French citizens a certain degree of freedom to work in Switzerland and vice versa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/6/395_362_395/fr|title= Traité sur l'établissement des Français en Suisse et des Suisses en France|website=admin.ch}}</ref> However, the 1950s and 1960s were years of very high economic growth in Geneva. This led to an increasing need to employ workers from across the border, from [[Pays de Gex]] and the [[Haute-Savoie]] - from 6,750 workers in 1966 to 22,500 in 1972.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chevalier|first=Henri|author-link= |date=2004 |title=L'affaire des fonds frontaliers|url= |location= |publisher=La Salévienne|isbn=}}</ref> Since Geneva refused to participate in the Franco-Swiss agreements for the distribution of income taxes levied on cross border workers of 1935 and 1966 that covered all the other cantons, the municipalities from the neighbouring French regions were increasingly suffocated by the need to finance public equipment for a population that did not financially contribute to the budgets. This situation led to a first grouping of municipalities to defend their interests, the “Association de Communes Frontalières”. Acknowledging the problem, Geneva agreed in 1973 to transfer 3.5% of the gross income of those workers directly to the French municipalities, equivalent to around CHF330 million/year nowadays.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tdg.ch/geneve-reverse-326-millions-de-francs-a-la-france-212463559530|title=Genève reverse 326 millions de francs à la France |website=tdg.ch|date=16 June 2021 }}</ref>

Cooperation increased following the 1980 Madrid accords on the [[Outline Convention on Transfrontier Co-operation]]. However, it was the 2002 agreement on the free movement of people between the European Union and Switzerland<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sem.admin.ch/sem/fr/home/themen/fza_schweiz-eu-efta.html|title=Libre circulation des personnes Suisse – UE/AELE |website=sem.admin.ch}}</ref> that had a bigger impact on Geneva's economy and society. The number of cross-border workers increased from 35,000 in 2002 to 92,000 in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ge.ch/statistique/domaines/03/03_05/tableaux.asp#2|title= Frontaliers étrangers actifs|website=ge.ch}}</ref> This vastly increased the need for cooperation, notably in transportation. It led to the creation of the “Agglomeration Franco-Valdo-Genevoise”, later renamed “[[Grand Genève]]“ in 2012, which roughly corresponds in geographical extension to the 1-million inhabitants metropolitan area of Geneva extending beyond the cantonal borders across [[Vaud]], [[Ain]], and [[Haute-Savoie]]. Its major achievements include the push towards the construction and operation of the [[Léman Express]] rail network and the projected extensions of the [[trams in Geneva|tpg tram network]] to [[Annemasse]], [[St-Julien-en-Genevois]], and [[Ferney-Voltaire]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grand-geneve.org/concretement/realisations|title=Realisations du Grand Genève|website=grand-geneve.org|access-date=27 July 2021|archive-date=27 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210727150927/https://www.grand-geneve.org/concretement/realisations|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Coat of arms ==
[[File:Armoiries cantonales GE avec devise.svg|thumb|311x311px|left]]

The elements of its coat of arms are:
*Shield: showing the Imperial Eagle and a Key of St. Peter (symbolizing the status of Geneva as Reichsstadt and as episcopal seat, respectively), in use since the 15th century
*Crest in the form of half a sun inscribed with ΙΗΣ (for Jesus Hominum Salvator)
*The motto: Post Tenebras Lux

The current coat of arms, adopted from the city of Geneva, represent the union of the semi-eagle originating from the two-headed eagle from the [[Holy Roman Empire]], in which Geneva formed part in the Middle Ages, and the gold key from the coat of arms of the bishopric of Geneva, symbolising the Key of St. Peter, patron saint of the cathedral. The bishop was a direct vassal of the emperor and he exercised in his name the temporal power over the city. Symbolising the union of spiritual and mortal powers, the coat of arms were adopted by the citizens of Geneva in 1387. The old colours of Geneva were grey and black and changed to black and purple in the 17th century. Gold and red began to be used from the 18th century.

The crest with the sun and the [[Christogram#IHS|ΙΗΣ]] inscription, denoting the first three letters of the Greek name of Jesus, exists since the 15th century but was used on the coat of arms until the 16th century.

The motto of Geneva, [[Post Tenebras Lux]], stands in Latin for "light after darkness", appears in the Vulgate version of Job 17:12. The phrase was adopted as the Calvinist motto later by the entire Protestant Reformation and by Geneva.

== Geography ==

=== Political geography: definition of today's cantonal borders ===
[[File:Charles pictet de rochemont.jpg|thumb|left|Charles Pictet de Rochemont, the Geneva envoy to the Congress of Vienna who negotiated the canton's borders]]

Following the events that transformed Switzerland under the [[Helvetic Republic]], Geneva joined the [[Restoration and Regeneration in Switzerland|Swiss Confederation]] in 1815 as the 22nd canton. The territory of the present canton of Geneva was largely established as a result of the [[Congress of Vienna]], in order to provide contiguity between the city of Geneva and its satellite territories established during the previous negotiations with France and Savoy, such as the Mandement, and to physically join the canton to the rest of Switzerland.

During the negotiations, the authorities were split between those who sought to maximise the gain in territory for the new canton at the expense of France and Sardinia, and the conservatives who wanted to minimise the gain in territory to avoid including a large number of Catholics in the new canton. The former were led by [[Charles Pictet de Rochemont]], a Genevan statesmen and diplomat. The conservatives, formed largely of old Genevan aristocracy, were led by Joseph des Arts who in addition preferred to keep Geneva's independence. However, in the end neither side got what they wanted as larger events dominated the situation.

[[File:Karte-Kanton-Genf-1814-Erster-Friede-von-Paris.png|thumb|Map of the canton of Geneva after the first peace of Paris May 1814]]
[[File:Karte-Kanton-Genf-1815-Pariser-Vertrag.png|thumb|Map of the canton of Geneva after the treaty of Paris 1815]]

Charles Pictet de Rochemont was tasked with the negotiations with the powers in Paris and later Vienna. In his initial plans presented to the Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], he suggested a new canton extending from the summits of the Jura surrounding the city ([[Crêt de la Neige]]), all the way to mount [[Salève]] and les Voirons. This, therefore, included the Pays de Gex and all the lands in the Genevan basin. In part of these negotiations, it was even suggested to transfer the area of [[Porrentruy]] to France in exchange for the Pays de Gex. However, [[Louis XVIII]] was adamantly opposed to transferring catholic subjects to the "Protestant Rome", so France did not have to cede any territory to Geneva in the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Peace of Paris]] in May 1814. Only after the return of Napoleon and the second [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]] Geneva could achieve limited territorial gains to link to the canton to Vaud and break the isolation of the enclaves in the Mandement. One town in particular, [[Ferney]], continues to act today as a bottleneck in the connection to the rest of the country, as France was emotionally attached to the chosen home of [[Voltaire]] and refused to cede it. The negotiations with France were concluded by the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris of 1815]], whereby the canton added the current municipalities of Versoix (which provided the geographical link with neighbouring Vaud), Collex-Bossy, Pregny-Chambésy, Vernier, Meyrin and Grand-Saconnex.<ref>{{cite book |last=Barbier Claude|first= Schwarz Pierre-François|author-link= |date=2016 |title=Atlas Historique de Genève vol I|url= |location= |publisher=La Salévienne|page=92|isbn=}}</ref>

In similar negotiations with the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], Charles Pictet de Rochemont pursued the acquisition of the lands adjoining Geneva and included the slopes of mount Salève. However, Turin opposed this demand as the area contained the important road linking [[Thonon-les-Bains]] and the [[Faucigny]] with [[Annecy]]. In the end, the diplomat managed to swap this demand, as well as a demand for a longer portion of the coastline of the lake, for a large gain in territory from [[Chancy]] to [[Geneva]] (what is now the Campagne), as well as lands around the mandement of Jussy. These negotiations were concluded by the [[Treaty of Turin (1816)|Treaty of Turin of 1816]] with Sardinia, from which the new canton gained the present municipalities of Laconnex, Soral, Perly-Certoux, Plan-les-Ouates, Bernex, Aire-la-Ville, Onex, Confignon, Lancy, Bardonnex, Troinex, Veyrier, Chêne-Thônex, Puplinge, Presinge, Choulex, Meinier, Collonge-Bellerive, Corsier, Hermance, Anières, and Carouge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ge.ch/archives/12-traites-de-paris-de-turin|title=12. Traités de Paris et de Turin &#124; Archives - République et canton de Genève (Suisse) - ge.ch|first=Etat de|last=Genève|website=ge.ch}}</ref>

In total, the canton added 159 square kilometres of territory, settled with over 16,000 inhabitants, mostly catholic and rural. At the time, the city and its possessions had 29,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite book |last=Herrmann |first= Irène|author-link= |date=2003 |title=Genève entre république et Canton|url= |location= |publisher=Éditions passé présent|page= |isbn=}}</ref>

[[File:Karte-Kanton-Genf-1816-Turiner-Vertrag.png|thumb|Map of the canton of Geneva after the treaty of Turin 1816]]

Initially, many of the new villages were grouped together by the Genevan government. For example, the hamlets of Avusy, Soral, and Laconnex formed one single municipality. The same occurred to Bernex, Onex, and Confignon, or to Plan-les-Ouates, Bardonnex, Perly, and Certoux (the four villages formed '[[Compèsieres]]'). However, the Paris and Turin treaties did not deal with the issue of common land in those villages (nor with the issue of common land that was now separated by international borders). This resulted into tensions as villagers did not want to share their local common land with villagers from the same municipality as the distribution of land and the resulting revenue was highly uneven. A cantonal law from 5 February 1849 required municipal acts be voted by counsellors, and to identify in the minutes the position of each counsellor and the reason for their vote. This increased transparency but it led to tensions related to the placement of schools, townhalls and other public buildings and services in addition to the issue on communal lands. Eventually, these tensions led to the separation of those villages in the second half of the 19th century, which led to the present-day municipal borders for those newly acquired lands.<ref>{{cite book |last=Barbier Claude|first= Schwarz Pierre-François|author-link= |date=2017 |title=Atlas Historique de Genève vol II|url= |location= |publisher=La Salévienne|page=116|isbn=}}</ref>[[File:GenèveCommunes-1815-1816-clr.jpg|thumb|Borders after the Congress of Vienna: in yellow, the previous lands of Geneva; in blue, lands ceded by France; in pink, lands ceded by Savoy.]]

The last municipal border change occurred in 1931. As a result of a push towards the rationalisation of resources following the 1920s economic crisis, the municipalities that formed the ancient urban part of the Republic of Geneva (Eaux-Vives, le Petit-Saconnex, Plainpalais, and Geneva) merged to form the modern city of Geneva.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archives.geneve.ch/archive/eac/commune_des_eaux_vivesISAAR|title=Archives de Genève- Histoire de la commune des Eaux-Vives |website=archives.geneve.ch}}</ref>

In 1956, as a result of the planned expansion of [[Geneva Airport]], both countries agreed to exchange a piece of territory to fit in the new runway, affecting the French municipality of [[Ferney-Voltaire]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1958/129_135_141/fr|title=Convention entre la Suisse et la France concernant l'aménagement de l'aéroport de Genève-Cointrin et la création de bureaux à contrôles nationaux juxtaposés à Ferney‑Voltaire et à Genève‑Cointrin|website=admin.ch}}</ref>

The last change of the canton's borders occurred in 2003, when the construction of the border crossing in the new section of highway linking the Swiss [[A1 motorway (Switzerland)|A1]] to the French [[A41 motorway (France)|A41]] required an exchange of territories. Land was transferred from the municipality of [[Bardonnex]], to [[St-Julien-en-Genevois]]. To compensate for the loss of Genevan soil, the municipality of [[Soral]] gained territory from [[Viry (Haute-Savoie)|Viry]] and St-Julien.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.senat.fr/leg/pjl02-221.html|title=Convention entre la République française et la Confédération suisse portant rectifications de la frontière entre les départements de l'Ain et de la Haute-Savoie et le canton de Genève, faite à Berne le 18 janvier 2002|website=Senat.fr|date=7 April 2023 }}</ref>

===Physical geography===
Geneva is the [[List of Swiss cantons by elevation|canton with the smallest difference between its lowest and highest points]], being of only 184 metres. However, it is surrounded across its borders by the numerous mountains of the [[Jura Mountains|Jura]] and [[Alps|Alpine foothills]], notably the [[Crêt de la Neige]] and its neighbour [[Le Reculet]] (the highest, and second-highest peaks of the Jura, respectively), the [[Salève]], the [[Voirons]], and [[La Dôle]] (in Vaud territory). The area of the canton of Geneva is {{convert|282|km2|sqmi|1|sp=us}}.

The canton of located in the extreme west of Switzerland. Excluding the exclave of the municipality of [[Céligny]], the canton shares 95% of its border with France: 103&nbsp;km out a total of 107.5&nbsp;km, the remaining 4.5&nbsp;km are shared with Vaud.

Geneva is surrounded by the French departments of the [[Ain]] to its west, and that of the [[Haute Savoie]] to the East and South, and the canton of Vaud to the north.

[[File:Genevan basin from Reculet.jpg|800px|thumb|center|View from Reculet mountain towards Geneva. The canton occupies most of the Geneva basin, the valley between the Reculet (France) and Mount Salève (France). The Alps are visible in the background, covered by clouds]]

The canton is located in the Genevan basin. The region is bordered by the Lake Geneva and traversed by the major rivers of the [[Rhone]] flowing out of the lake and the [[Arve]], whose source is located in the Mont-Blanc region. It is encircled by the Jura on its north-west; by the [[Vuache]] to its west, split from the Jura by the Rhone valley and protected by the [[Fort l'Écluse]]; by the Mont-de-Sion to the South; by the Salève to the south-east, a mountain locals refer to as the "mountain of Genevans" despite being located in France due to its easy access and proximity; and to the east are the Alps, whose highest peak, the Mont-Blanc, is often visible from many parts of the canton.

To the north-east of Salève, in [[Monniaz]] (municipality of Jussy), is located the highest point of the canton at 516 metres above sea level. The lowest point of the canton is along the [[Rhône]] south of [[Chancy]] at 332 metres.

[[File:Cheneviers et Verbois.jpg|thumb|278x278px|The SIG-owned incinerator of Cheneviers, Verbois dam, and the solar farm, bordering the river Rhône. In the background, the Mandement area and the Jura mountains.]]

The canton contains both the urban landscape of the city of Geneva and its surrounding towns, and a well-preserved rural landscape. The Mandement, in the north-west of the canton, is a partial valley dug by the river [[Allondon]], a tributary of the Rhone, and regrouping the major wine-making towns of Satigny, Russin, and Dardagny. The Verbois dam built over the Rhone in that area supplies around 15% of the electricity needs of the canton and it links the Mandement to Champagne, on the opposite side of the river, between the towns of Russin and Aire-la-Ville.

[[Chancy]], the westernmost municipality of Switzerland, is located in Champagne. The slope raises gently from the Rhone towards the main town of the region, [[Bernex, Switzerland|Bernex]], culminating in the Signal at 509.9 metres, the second-highest point of the canton. This region contains several historical villages such as Sézegnin, Athenaz, Avusy, Laconnex, Soral, Cartigny, and Avully, transferred to Geneva from the Duchy of Savoy in 1815.

At its narrowest point, the canton measures 2.1&nbsp;km between the lake in Vegneron and the French border in Ferney-Voltaire. As this is the only territory connecting the canton towards the rest of Switzerland, this small piece of land is crossed by the main railway towards Lausanne and Neuchâtel; the A1 highway and its interchange; several roads; the international airport; two high-voltage electric lines; a gas pipeline; an oil pipeline; and a bicycle path.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ge.ch/sitg/|title = SITG &#124; le territoire genevois à la carte}}</ref>

===Federal elections===
{{Update section|date=December 2019}}

====National Council====
In 2019 the Republic and Canton of Geneva gained a seat and sent a total of 12 representatives to the [[National Council (Switzerland)|National Council]]. The [[2019 Swiss federal election|federal election]] held on 20 October 2019 did result in an electoral breakthrough for the [[Green Party of Switzerland|Green Party (PES/GPS)]] which for the first time was the most popular party with a vote share of 24.6%. [[FDP.The Liberals|The Liberals (PLR/FDP)]] were relegated to the second place, losing 2.6% of their vote share and a seat in the National Council. Two mandates were also allotted to the [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democratic Party (PS/SP)]] and the [[Swiss People's Party|UDC/SVP]] receiving 14.7% or 13.7% respectively. The [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|Christian Democratic People's Party (PDC/CVP)]] managed to hold their seat with 7.7% while the {{ill|Ensemble à gauche|fr|lt=EAG|vertical-align=sup}} coalition gained 7.4% of the votes and a seat. The election also resulted in the [[Geneva Citizens' Movement|Geneva Citizens' Movement (MCG)]] losing their only seat with a decreased vote share of 5.4% compared to 7.9% in [[2015 Swiss federal election|2015]]. Voter turnout decreased to 38.2%, the lowest recorded among all cantons in 2019.<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=29 November 2019 |title=Nationalratswahlen 2019 - Analyse der Parteistärken und der Mandate seit 1971 |url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/kataloge-datenbanken/publikationen.assetdetail.10907687.html |language=fr, de, it  |location=Neuchâtel, Switzerland |publisher=Swiss Federal Statistical Office |page= |isbn=978-3-303-17037-3}}</ref>

====Council of States====
The last elections to the [[Council of States (Switzerland)]] were held in two rounds taking place on 20 October 2019 and 10 November 2019 within the federal elections. The election resulted in two new members being seated after the second round of voting. Councillor [[Lisa Mazzone]] of the [[Green Party of Switzerland|Green Party (PES/GPS)]] was elected with 45,998 votes and councillor [[Carlo Sommaruga]], member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democratic Party (PS/SP)]] was elected with 41,839 votes. Outgoing councillors were [[Liliane Maury Pasquier]] of the Social Democratic Party and [[Robert Cramer (Swiss politician)|Robert Cramer]] of the Green Party which were both first elected in [[2007 Swiss federal election|2007]]. Both parties therefore maintained their representation in the council.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/politik/wahlen/eidg-wahlen-2019/resultate-genf.assetdetail.8287095.html |title=Ständerat Ergebnisse der Kandidierenden: Kanton Genf |publisher=Bundesamt für Statistik |language=fr, de, it   |date=20 October 2019 |access-date=2022-09-11}}</ref>

As home of [[John Calvin]]'s [[Swiss Reformation|Reformation]], the canton of Geneva has traditionally been a [[Protestant]] Christian stronghold. However, during the 19th and 20th centuries, the [[Roman Catholic]] population of the canton increased dramatically, largely due to the expansion of the border in 1815 towards Catholic areas and to immigration from Catholic European countries; their community numbered 220,139 people or 44.5% {{as of|2017|lc=on}}. Roman Catholics now outnumber members of the [[Swiss Reformed Church]] (65,629 people or 13.3% {{as of|2017|lc=on}}) in the canton by far.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://kirchenstatistik.spi-sg.ch/entwicklung-der-kirchenmitgliedschaft/#close|title=Kirchenmitgliedschaft in der römisch-katholischen und evangelisch-reformierten Kirche nach Kantonen (2017)|type=Table 1.4 on the lower part of the page|publisher=SPI St. Gallen|date=2018|access-date=2019-03-21|language=de}}</ref> The surrounding regions of France are mostly Roman Catholic.

In 2012, 5.4% of the Genevan population (aged 15 years and older) belonged to other Christian groups, 5.5% were [[Muslims]], and 5.9% belonged to other religious groups.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ge.ch/statistique/domaines/apercu.asp?dom=01_05 |title=Statistiques cantonales – Les 21 domaines: 01.

The canton consistently ranks as one of the strongest global financial centres.<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 2020 |title=The Global Financial Centres Index 27 |url=https://www.longfinance.net/media/documents/GFCI_27_Full_Report_2020.03.26_v1.1_.pdf |website=Long Finance}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.longfinance.net/documents/2902/GFCI_31_Report_2022.03.24_v1.0.pdf |title=The global financial centres index 31|access-date=26 June 2022}}</ref> Three main sectors dominate the financial sector: commodity trading; trade finance, and wealth management.

Around a third of the world's free traded oil, sugar, grains and oil seeds is traded in Geneva. Approximately 22% of the world's cotton is traded in the Lake Geneva region. Other major commodities traded in the canton include steel, electricity, or coffee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stsa.swiss/know/commodity-trading-companies|title=STSA|website=www.stsa.swiss}}</ref> Large trading companies have their regional or global headquarters in the canton, such as [[Trafigura]], [[Cargill]], [[Vitol]], [[Gunvor]], [[BNP Paribas]], or [[Mercuria Energy Group]], in addition to being home to the world's largest shipping company, [[Mediterranean Shipping Company]]. Commodity trading is supported by a strong trade finance sector, with large banks such as [[Banque cantonale de Genève|BCGE]], Banque de Commerce et de Placements, [[Banque cantonale vaudoise|BCV]], [[Crédit Agricole]], [[ING]], [[Société Générale]], [[BRED Banque populaire|BIC-BRED]], [[Bank of China]], and [[UBS]], all having their headquarters in the region for this business.

Wealth management is dominated by non-publicly listed banks, particularly [[The Pictet Group|Pictet]], [[Lombard Odier]], [[Union Bancaire Privée]], [[Edmond de Rothschild Group]], [[Mirabaud Group]], [[Dukascopy Bank]], [[Bordier & Cie]], [[Banque SYZ]], or [[REYL & Cie]]. In addition, the canton is home to the largest concentration of foreign-owned banks in Switzerland, such as [[HSBC|HSBC Private Bank]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[Bank of China]], [[Barclays]], or [[Arab Bank]].

Behind the financial sector, the next largest major economic sector is watchmaking, dominated by luxury firms [[Rolex]], [[Richemont]], [[Patek Philippe]], and others, whose factories are mostly concentrated in the municipalities of [[Plan-les-Ouates]] and [[Meyrin]].

Trade finance, wealth management, and watchmaking, approximately contribute two-thirds of the corporate tax paid in the canton.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ge.ch/statistique/graphiques/affichage.asp?filtreGraph=06_02&dom=1|title=Statistiques cantonales - République et canton de Genève|website=www.ge.ch}}</ref>

Other large multinationals are also headquartered in the canton, such as [[Firmenich]] (in Satigny), and [[Givaudan]] (in Vernier), the world's two largest manufacturers of flavours, fragrances and active cosmetic ingredients; [[SGS S.A.|SGS]], the world's largest inspection, verification, testing and certification services company; [[Alcon]] (in Vernier), a company specialising in eye-care products; [[Temenos AG|Temenos]], a large banking software provider; or the local headquarters for [[Procter & Gamble]], [[Japan Tobacco International]], or [[L'Oréal]].

Although they do not directly contribute to the local economy, the canton of Geneva is also host to the world's largest concentration of international organisations and UN agencies, such as the [[Red Cross]], the [[World Health Organization]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[International Telecommunication Union]], the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], the [[World Meteorological Organization]], and the [[International Labour Organization]], as well as the European headquarters of the [[United Nations Office at Geneva|United Nations]].

Its international mindedness, well-connected [[Geneva Airport|airport]], and centrality in the continent, also make Geneva a good destination for congresses and trade fairs, of which the largest two are the [[Geneva Motor Show]] and [[Watches & Wonders]], both held in [[Palexpo]].

[[File:Vignobles de Satigny.jpg|thumb|500px|upright=1.8|center|Geneva has the densest vineyards of Switzerland. Here, the largest wine-making municipality of Switzerland, Satigny.]]

Agriculture is commonplace in the hinterlands of Geneva, particularly wheat and wine. Despite its relatively small size, the canton produces around 10% of the Swiss wine and has the highest vineyard density in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://swisswine.ch/fr/region/geneve|title=Genève|date=4 April 2016|website=Swiss Wine|access-date=21 September 2020|archive-date=3 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210303024337/https://swisswine.ch/fr/region/geneve|url-status=dead}}</ref> The largest strains grown in Geneva are gamay, chasselas, pinot noir, gamaret, and chardonnay.

== Transport ==
[[File:Leman Express map.svg|300px|thumb|right|The Léman Express network]]

Geneva is linked to the rest of Switzerland with trains operated by the [[Swiss Federal Railways]], with main lines towards [[Brig-Glis|Brig]] in the canton of [[Valais]] via [[Lausanne]], to [[St. Gallen]] via [[Lausanne]], [[Fribourg]], [[Bern]] and [[Zürich]] or alternatively via [[Neuchâtel]] on the [[Jura Foot Railway]], and to [[Lucerne]].

Since 1984 the French high-speed trains (TGV) serve Geneva, with services connecting to [[Paris]] and as far as [[Marseille]], operated by [[TGV Lyria]], a joint company owned by the [[SNCF]] and the Swiss Federal Railways. The SNCF also operates regional train services to [[Lyon]].

The public transport of Geneva is operated by [[Transports Publics Genevois]], which on average carry a total of 200 million passengers per year on its extensive network of trams, trolleybuses, buses, and boats,<ref>https://www.tpg.ch/sites/default/files/2020-06/TPG-RAG2019.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref> and by Lemanis, which operates the suburban rail network, the [[Léman Express]]. All the operators of the region operate under [[Unireso]], so any ticket is valid in all the network within the canton as well as in France.

[[File:Tram and rail network geneva.png|thumb|302x302px|Tram and rail coverage of Geneva's urban area]]

After the inauguration of the missing rail link between Geneva and the border French city of [[Annemasse]] and the creation of the Léman Express in 2019, many secondary bus routes were re-designed as feeders to the new train stations. Soon after the opening of the rail network and prior to the COVID-19 crisis in 2020, it had met all its expectations in terms of passenger numbers with 25,000 daily users.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lematin.ch/story/leman-express-25-000-passagers-par-jour-216497541131|title=Léman Express: 25'000 passagers par jour|newspaper=Le Matin|date=20 January 2020|via=www.lematin.ch}}</ref> Several municipalities of the canton, especially those in the Mandement ([[Satigny]], [[Russin]], [[Dardagny]]), and those on the right-bank of the lake (from [[Chambésy]] to [[Versoix]]) rely heavily on the rail for their commuting.

The tram network is also an important element of cohesion of the canton, linking the city of Geneva to its dense urban surroundings formed by large municipalities such as [[Lancy]], [[Meyrin]], [[Vernier, Switzerland|Vernier]], [[Onex, switzerland|Onex]] or [[Bernex, Switzerland|Bernex]]. Several extensions of the network are planned for the near future, including an extension towards the French city of [[Saint-Julien-en-Genevois]] via [[Plan-les-Ouates]], and towards [[Grand Saconnex]] near the airport.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ge.ch/dossier/organiser-avenir-transports/developpement-du-reseau-tramway |title=Développement du réseau de tramway &#124; GE.CH – République et canton de Genève |access-date=22 September 2020 |archive-date=1 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201001184926/https://www.ge.ch/dossier/organiser-avenir-transports/developpement-du-reseau-tramway |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1964, the first Swiss motorway, the [[A1 motorway (Switzerland)|A1]], was built between Geneva and Lausanne as part of the investments carried out for the [[Expo 64|Swiss national exposition of 1964]], and later it was extended all the way to the border with Austria. The canton is also linked to the French motorway system with the [[A40 autoroute]], offering a speedy access to the [[Mont Blanc tunnel]].

== Education ==
The main educational institution is the [[University of Geneva]], founded in 1559 by [[John Calvin]]. It was originally called ''Schola Genevensis''. The original buildings are no longer used by the university, and are now used by [[Collège Calvin]].

The public system starts from the age of 4 in one of the 165 primary schools of the canton. This is followed in one of the 19 cycle d'orientation from the ages of 12 to 15. Students then choose to follow an academic route in one of the 11 collèges, or an apprenticeship/general studies in one of the 14 specialised schools.

In addition, the canton's private schools have a good reputation for academic excellence. Many of these schools, such as the [[International School of Geneva]], and [[Institut Florimont]], also offer the [[International Baccalaureate]]. This programme was founded in Geneva in the 1960s and it is still headquartered in the canton.

==Culture==
The ''[[Jeûne genevois]]'' is a public holiday specific to Geneva, celebrated on the Thursday following the first Sunday of September.

''[[L'Escalade]]'', or Fête de l'Escalade (from escalade, the act of scaling defensive walls), is an annual festival held in December in Geneva, Switzerland, celebrating the defeat of the surprise attack by troops sent by Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy during the night of 11–12 December 1602 ([[Old style]]). The celebrations and other commemorative activities are usually held on 12 December or the closest weekend.
