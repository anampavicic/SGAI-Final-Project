'''West Java''' ({{langx|id|Jawa Barat}}, {{langx|su|{{Sund|ᮏᮝ ᮊᮥᮜᮧᮔ᮪}}|Jawa Kulon}}) is an Indonesian [[Provinces of Indonesia|province]] on the western part of the island of [[Java]], with its provincial capital in [[Bandung]]. West Java is bordered by the province of [[Banten]] and the country's capital region of [[Jakarta]] to the west, the [[Java Sea]] to the north, the province of [[Central Java]] to the east and the [[Indian Ocean]] to the south. With [[Banten]], this province is the native homeland of the [[Sundanese people]], the [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|second-largest ethnic group in Indonesia]].

West Java was one of the first eight provinces of Indonesia formed following the [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|country's independence proclamation]] and was later legally re-established on 14 July 1950. In 1966, the city of [[Jakarta]] was split off from West Java as a 'special capital region' ({{lang|id|Daerah Khusus Ibukota}}), with a status equivalent to that of a province,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Jakarta|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106450/Jakarta#13148.toc|access-date=17 September 2007|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|archive-date=11 November 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111193732/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106450/Jakarta#13148.toc|url-status=live}}</ref> while in 2000 the western parts of the province were in turn split away to form a separate [[Banten]] province.

Even following these split-offs, West Java is by far the most populous province of Indonesia with a population of 48,274,162 as of the 2020 Census,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> which grew to 49,860,330 at mid 2023 according to the official estimates;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Provinsi Jawa Barat Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.32)</ref> the population continues to grew and surpassed the 50 millions milestone during late 2023. The province's largest cities, [[Bekasi]] (a [[satellite city]] within the [[Jakarta metropolitan area]]), [[Bandung]] and [[Depok]] (the latter also within the Jakarta metropolitan area), are the third, fourth and sixth [[List of Indonesian cities by population|most populous cities in Indonesia]] respectively. Bandung is also one of the [[List of cities proper by population density|most densely populated cities proper in the world]].<ref name="depkes.go.id">{{cite web|access-date=20 February 2014|url=http://www.depkes.go.id/downloads/Penduduk%20Kab%20Kota%20Umur%20Tunggal%202014.pdf|title=Estimasi Penduduk Menurut Umur Tunggal Dan Jenis Kelamin 2014 Kementerian Kesehatan|archive-date=8 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208021950/http://depkes.go.id/downloads/Penduduk%20Kab%20Kota%20Umur%20Tunggal%202014.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De weg van Buitenzorg naar de Preanger Regentschappen TMnr 3728-429c.jpg|thumb|left|[[Parahyangan]] highland near [[Buitenzorg]] ([[Bogor]]), c. 1865–1872]]

The oldest human inhabitant archaeological findings in the region were unearthed in [[Anyer]] on the western coast of Java with evidence of bronze and iron metallurgical culture dating to the first millennium AD.<ref name="Zahorka-2007">{{cite book|last=Zahorka|first=Herwig|publisher=Yayasan cipta Loka Caraka|title=The Sunda Kingdoms of West Java, From Tarumanagara to Pakuan Pajajaran with Royal Center of Bogor, Over 1000 Years of Propsperity and Glory|year=2007}}</ref> The prehistoric [[Buni culture]], near present-day [[Bekasi]], developed clay pottery with evidence found in Anyer to [[Cirebon]]. Artefacts dated 400&nbsp;BC — AD 100, such as food and drink containers, were found mostly as burial gifts.<ref name="Zahorka-2007" /> There is archaeological evidence in [[Batujaya Archaeological Site]] dating from the 2nd century{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} and, according to Dr Tony Djubiantono, the head of Bandung Archaeology Agency, Jiwa Temple in [[Batujaya]], [[Karawang]], was also built around this time.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

One of the earliest known{{clarify|date=July 2012}} recorded histories in Indonesia is from the former [[Tarumanagara]] kingdom, where seven, fourth-century stones are inscribed in Wengi letters (used in the [[Pallava]] period) and in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] describing the kings of the kingdom of Tarumanagara.<ref name="Zahorka-2007" /> Records of Tarumanegara lasted until the sixth century, which coincides with the attack of [[Srivijaya]], as stated in the [[Kota Kapur inscription]] (AD 686).

The [[Sunda Kingdom]] subsequently became the ruling power of the region, as recorded on the Kebon Kopi II inscription (AD 932).<ref name="Zahorka-2007" />

An Ulama, [[Sunan Gunung Jati]], settled in [[Cirebon]], intending to spread Islam in the town. Meanwhile, the [[Sultanate of Demak]] in Central Java grew to become a threat to the Sunda kingdom. To defend against the threat, Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkosa signed the [[Luso-Sundanese Treaty]] with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] in 1512. In return, the Portuguese were granted access to build fortresses and warehouses in the area, as well as forming trading agreements with the kingdom. This first international treaty of Sunda Kingdom with the Europeans was commemorated by the placement of the Padrao stone monument at the bank of the [[Ciliwung River]] in 1522.

Although the treaty with the Portuguese had been established, it could not come to realisation. [[Sunda Kalapa]] harbour fell under the alliance of the Sultanates of Demak and [[Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon]] (former [[vassal state]] of Sunda kingdom) in 1524 after forces under Paletehan alias Fadillah Khan had conquered the city. In 1524–1525, troops under [[Sunan Gunung Jati]] also seized the port of [[Banten (town)|Banten]] and established the [[Sultanate of Banten]] which was affiliated to the Demak Sultanate. The war between the Sunda kingdom and the Demak and Cirebon sultanates continued for five years until a peace treaty was made in 1531 between King Surawisesa and [[Sunan Gunungjati|Sunan Gunung Jati]]. From 1567 to 1579, under the last king Raja Mulya, alias Prabu Surya Kencana, the Sunda kingdom declined, under pressure from Sultanate of Banten. After 1576, the kingdom could not maintain control over its capital at [[Pakuan Pajajaran]] (present-day [[Bogor]]), and gradually the Sultanate of Banten took over the former Sunda kingdom's territory. The [[Mataram Sultanate]] from Central Java also seized the [[Priangan]] region, the southeastern part of the kingdom.

In the 16th century, [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]] and [[East India Company|British]] trading companies established trading ships in western Java after the fall of the Sultanate of Banten. For the next three hundred years, western Java fell under the [[Dutch East Indies]]' administration. West Java was officially declared as a province of Indonesia in 1950, referring to a statement from Staatblad number 378. On 17 October 2000, as part of nationwide political decentralisation, [[Banten]] was separated from West Java and made into a new province. There have been recent proposals to rename the province '''[[Pasundan]]''' ("Land of the [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]]") after the historical name for West Java.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nasrullah |first=Annas |date=2009-10-29 |title=Tokoh Jabar Siapkan Deklarasi Provinsi Pasundan : Okezone News |url=https://news.okezone.com/read/2009/10/28/340/270205/tokoh-jabar-siapkan-deklarasi-provinsi-pasundan |access-date=2023-02-19 |website=okezone |language=id-ID |archive-date=3 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184342/http://news.okezone.com/read/2009/10/28/340/270205/tokoh-jabar-siapkan-deklarasi-provinsi-pasundan |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Government and administrative division==
[[File:Gedung Sate Bandung Jawa Barat.jpg|thumb|[[Gedung Sate]] is a governor office of West Java]]
[[File:West Java Province.png|thumb|2nd-level Administrative map of West Java Province]]
Since the creation of West Java Province,<ref name=govwj /> the province of West Java was subdivided into four [[Cities of Indonesia|cities]] ({{lang|id|Kota}}) and sixteen [[Regencies of Indonesia|regencies]] ({{lang|id|Kabupaten}}), excluding the four regencies which were separated off in 2000 to form the new Banten Province. Subsequently five new independent cities were created between 1996 and 2002 by separation from their surrounding regencies - '''Bekasi''' on 16 December 1996, '''Depok''' on 27 April 1999, '''Cimahi''' and '''Tasikmalaya''' on 21 June 2001, and '''Banjar''' on 11 December 2002. A 17th regency was formed on 2 January 2007 – [[West Bandung Regency]] – from the western half of Bandung Regency, and an 18th regency was formed in October 2012 – [[Pangandaran Regency]] – from the southern half of Ciamis Regency. On 25 October 2013, the [[People's Representative Council]] (DPR) began reviewing draft laws on the establishment of 57 prospective new regencies (and eight new provinces),<ref>''Jakarta Post'', 14 November 2013</ref> including a further three regencies in West Java – South Garut (Garut Selatan), North Sukabumi (Sukabumi Utara) and West Bogor (Bogor Barat) – but no action has followed in view of the moratorium adopted since 2013 by the Indonesian government on the creation of new provinces, regencies and cities, so none of these three prospective regencies are shown separately on the map below, nor in the following table. 

These 9 cities and 18 regencies are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census <ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 2020 Census, <ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> together with official estimates as at mid 2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Provinsi Jawa Barat Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.32)</ref> They are divided into 627 [[Districts of West Java|districts]] ({{lang|id|Kecamatan}}) as at 2023, which comprise 663 urban [[Administrative village|villages]] ({{lang|id|Kelurahan}}) and 5,294 rural villages ({{lang|id|Desa}}).<ref name="govwj">{{cite book|title=Governance of West Java|year=2008|publisher=West Java Government|page=17}}</ref> The table also includes the average population density as at mid 2023 for each regency or city.<ref>Proyeksi Penduduk Kabupaten/Kpta Provinsi Jawa Barat 2020-2035 | Hasil Sunsus Penduduk 2020.</ref>).

West Java borders Jakarta and [[Banten]] province to the west and [[Central Java]] to the east. To the north is the [[Java Sea]]. To the south is the [[Indian Ocean]]. Unlike most other provinces in Indonesia which have their capitals in coastal areas, the provincial capital, Bandung, is located in the mountainous area in the centre of the province. [[Banten]] Province was formerly part of West Java but was created a separate province in 2000. West Java, in the densely populated western third of Java and covering a land area of 37,040.04 km<sup>2</sup> (larger than [[Guinea-Bissau]]), is home to almost one out of every five Indonesians.

West Java and Banten provinces, as a part of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], have more mountains and volcanoes than any of the other provinces in Indonesia. The vast volcanic mountainous region of inland West Java is traditionally known as [[Parahyangan]] (also known as [[Priangan]] or [[Preanger]]) which means "The abode of [[hyang]]s (gods)". It is considered as the heartland of the Sundanese people. The highest point of West Java is the [[stratovolcano]] [[Mount Cereme]] (3,078 metres) bordering [[Kuningan]] and [[Majalengka]] Regencies. West Java has rich and fertile volcanic soil. Agriculture, mostly traditional dry rice cultivation (known as ''ladang'' or ''huma''), has become the primary way of life of traditional Sundanese people. Since the era of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), West Java has been known as a productive plantation area for coffee, tea, quinine, and many other cash crops. The mountainous region of West Java is also a major producer of vegetables and decorative flowering plants. The landscape of the province is one of volcanic mountains, rugged terrain, forest, mountains, rivers, fertile agricultural land, and natural sea harbours.<ref>Taylor (2003), p. 123.</ref>

Flowing through the [[Bandung Basin]] to the northeast is the [[Citarum River|Tarum River]] (or ''Ci-tarum''), the longest and most important river in the province. This 300-km long river is the site of three dams, namely [[Cirata Dam]], [[Saguling Dam]], and [[Jatiluhur Dam]].

Initially, the economy of the [[Sundanese people]] in West Java relied heavily on [[rice]] cultivation. Ancient kingdoms established in the province such as the [[Tarumanagara]] and [[Sunda Kingdom]] are known to have relied on rice taxes and agriculture revenues. The cycle of life of the ancient Sundanese people revolved around the rice crop cycle. Traditional rice harvest festivals such as the [[Seren Taun]] were important. The ancient goddess of rice, [[Dewi Sri|Nyai Pohaci Sanghyang Asri]], is revered in Sundanese culture. Traditionally, Sundanese people often used dry rice cultivation (''ladang''). After the [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] expanded to the Priangan area in the early 17th century following the [[Sultan Agung]] campaign against Dutch Batavia, ''sawah'' (wet rice cultivation) began to be adopted in the northern lowlands of West Java. Regencies such as [[Indramayu]], [[Cirebon]], [[Subang Regency|Subang]], [[Karawang]] and [[Bekasi]] are now well known as vital rice-producing areas. The mountainous region of West Java supplies vegetables, flower and much horticultural produce to Jakarta and Bandung, while animal farms in West Java produce dairy products and meats.

=== Colonial period ===
During the entire Dutch colonial era, West Java fell under Dutch administration centred in [[Jakarta|Batavia]]. The Dutch colonial government introduced [[cash crops]] such as [[tea]], [[coffee]], and [[quinine]]. Since the 18th century, West Java (known as "De Preanger") was known as a productive plantation area and became integrated with global trade and economy. Services such as transportation and banking were provided to cater for wealthy Dutch plantation owners. West Java is known as one of the earliest developed regions in the Indonesian archipelago. In the early 20th century, the Dutch colonial government developed infrastructures for economic purposes, especially to support Dutch plantations in the region. Roads and railways were constructed to connect inland plantations area with urban centres such as Bandung and the port of Batavia.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

=== Post independence ===
After Indonesian independence in 1945, West Java became a supporting region for [[Jakarta]], the capital of Indonesia. Jakarta remained as the business and political centre of Indonesia. Several regencies and cities in West Java such as [[Bogor]], [[Bekasi]] and [[Depok]] were developed as supporting areas for Jakarta and came to form the [[Greater Jakarta]] area or ''Jabodetabek'' ('''Ja'''karta, '''Bo'''gor, '''De'''pok, '''Ta'''ngerang and '''Bek'''asi). The northern area of West Java has become a major industrial area, with areas such as Bekasi, [[Cikarang]] and [[Karawang]] sprawling with factories and industries. The area in and around [[Bandung]] has also developed as an industrial area.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

=== Natural resources ===
[[File:Puncak - Bogor - West Java.jpg|thumb|[[Tea Garden]] at [[Puncak]], Bogor Regency]]
Based on the data from Indonesia State Secretary, the total area of rice fields in West Java Province in 2006 was 9,488,623&nbsp;km which produced 9,418,882&nbsp;tons of paddy in 2006, consisting of 9,103,800&nbsp;tons rice field paddy and 315,082&nbsp;tons farmland paddy. Palawija (non-rice food) production, reached 2,044,674&nbsp;tons with productivity 179.28 quintal per ha. Nevertheless, the widest plant's width is for corn commodity which reaches 148,505&nbsp;ha. West Java also produces horticulture consists of 2,938,624&nbsp;tons vegetables, 3,193,744&nbsp;tons fruits, and 159,871&nbsp;tons medicines plants/ bio pharmacology.

Forest in West Java covers 764,387.59 ha or 20.62% from the total size of the province. It consists of productive forest 362,980.40 ha (9.79%), protected forest 228,727.11 ha (6.17%), and conservation forest 172,680&nbsp;ha (4.63%). Mangrove forest reaches 40,129.89 ha, and spread in 10 regencies where coasts are available. Besides, there is also another protected forest of about 32,313.59 ha organised by Perum Perhutani Unit III West Java and Banten.

From the productive forest, in 2006 West Java harvested crop of about 200,675&nbsp;m³ wood, although the need for wood in this province every year is about 4&nbsp;million&nbsp;m³. Until 2006, populace forest's width 214,892&nbsp;ha with wood production is about 893,851.75&nbsp;m³. West Java also produces non-forest's crop which is potential enough to be developed as forestry work, such as silk, mushroom, pine, dammar, maleleuca, rattan, bamboo, and swallow bird's nest.

In the fishery sector, commodities include goldfish, nila fish, milkfish, freshwater catfish, windu shrimp, green mussel, gouramy, patin, seaweed and vaname shrimp. In 2006, this province harvested 560,000&nbsp;tons of fish from fishery cultivation crop and brackish or 63.63% from fishery production total in West Java.

In the poultry field, dairy cow, domestic poultry, and ducks are common commodities in West Java. 2006 data stated that there are 96,796 dairy cows (25% of the national population), 4,249,670 sheep, 28,652,493 domestic poultries, and 5,596,882 ducks (16% of the national population). Now there are only 245,994 beef cattle in West Java (3% national population), whereas the need every year is about 300,000 beef cattle.

This province has many plantation crops, such as tea, cloves, coconut, rubber, cacao, tobacco, coffee, sugar, palm and akar wangi ([[Chrysopogon zizanioides]]). From all those commodities, cloves, coconut, rubber, cocoa, tobacco, and coffee are common in West Java.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} From area side, the best productivity, that is plan area's width equals with the plant's width that produces tobacco and sugar palm commodities. From the production side, the highest productivity is oil palm (6.5&nbsp;tons per ha) and sugar palm (5.5&nbsp;tons per ha).

West Java also has several mining operations. In 2006, it contributed 5,284&nbsp;tons zeolite, 47,978&nbsp;tons bentonite, iron sand, pozzolan cement, feldspar, and jewel barn/ gemstone. Precious stone mining potential generally is found in Garut, Tasikmalaya, Kuningan, and Sukabumi Regency areas.

As consequences of having many volcanoes, West Java has the potential of [[geothermal energy]]. There are eleven points of geothermal energy, and three, i.e. [[Papandayan]], [[Mount Cereme|Ceremai]], and [[Gede Pangrango]] have conducted pre-exploration.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/69958/w-java-to-explore-eleven-geothermal-spots |title=W Java to explore eleven geothermal spots – ANTARA News<!-- Bot generated title --> |date=5 April 2011 |access-date=15 December 2013 |archive-date=17 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817103302/http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/69958/w-java-to-explore-eleven-geothermal-spots |url-status=live }}</ref>

Raw natural resources include [[chalk]], several offshore oilfields in the [[Java Sea]], and lumber. Most of the province is very fertile, with a mix of small farms and larger plantations. There are several [[hydropower]] dams, including [[Jatiluhur Dam|Jatiluhur]], [[Saguling Dam|Saguling]], [[Cirata Dam|Cirata]], and [[Jatigede Dam|Jatigede]].

=== Tourism ===

West Java is the native homeland of [[Sundanese people]] which forms the largest ethnic group in West Java. Since Jakarta and the surrounding area, including West Java, is the business and political centre of Indonesia, the province has attracted various people from other parts of Indonesia. The biggest minority is [[Javanese people|Javanese]] who migrated to the province centuries ago. Other [[Native Indonesian]] ethnic groups such as [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]], [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]], [[Madurese people|Madurese]], [[Balinese people|Balinese]], [[Ambonese]] and many other Indonesians who migrated to and settled in West Java cities can also be easily found. The urban areas also have a significant population of [[Chinese Indonesian]]s.

In addition to [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], the official national language, the other widely spoken language in the province is [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]]. In some areas near the southern borders with [[Central Java]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]] is also spoken. The main language spoken in [[Cirebon]] and nearby areas ([[Majalengka]], [[Indramayu]], [[Sumber, Cirebon|Sumber]]) is [[Cirebonese]], a dialect of Javanese with Sundanese influence.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Matthew Isaac|title=The Arts of Cirebon|journal=Seleh Notes|volume=12 #2|page=6|date=March 2005}}</ref>

[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is widely spoken as a second language.

== Cultures ==
{{See also|Sundanese people}}
The Sundanese share the Java island with the Javanese and primarily live in West Java. Although the Sundanese live on the same island as the Javanese, their culture is distinct and likewise consider themselves to live in a separate cultural area called ''Pasundan'' or ''Tatar Sunda''. Someone moving from West Java to Central or East Java is literally said to be moving from Sunda to Java worlds. Bandung is considered as the cultural heartland of [[Sundanese people]], and many indigenous Sundanese artforms were developed in this city. The nearby province of [[Banten]] is similar in this regard and is also considered to be part of ''Pasundan'' as well.

=== Music ===
[[File:Gamelandegung.jpg|thumb|[[Gamelan Degung]] Orchestra]]
The musical arts of Sunda, which is an expression of the emotions of Sundanese culture, express politeness and grace of Sundanese. [[Degung]] orchestra consists of Sundanese [[gamelan]]. In addition to the Sundanese forms of Gamelan in [[Parahyangan]], the region of Cirebon retains its own distinct musical traditions. Amongst Cirebons' varying Gamelan ensembles the two most frequently heard are Gamelan Pelog (a non-equidistant heptatonic tuning system) and Gamelan Prawa (a semi-equidistant pentatonic tuning system). Gamelan Pelog is traditionally reserved for Tayuban, Wayang Cepak, and listening and dance music of the Kratons in Cirebon, while Gamelan Prawa is traditionally reserved for Wayang Purwa.

[[Cirebon]] also retains specialised Gamelan ensembles including Sekaten, which is played in the Kratons to mark important times in the Islamic calendar, Denggung, also a Kraton ensemble, which is believed to have some "supernatural powers", and Renteng, an ensemble found in both Cirebon and Parahyangan known for its loud and energetic playing style.
[[File:SambaSunda Quintett in Cologne (0233).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Tembang Sunda]] performance in Cologne 2010]]
[[Tembang Sunda]] is a genre of Sundanese vocal music accompanied by a core ensemble of two [[Kacapi]] (zither) and a [[Suling]] (bamboo flute). The music and poetry of tembang Sunda are closely associated with the Parahyangan, the highland plateau that transverses the central and southern parts of Sunda. The natural environment of Priangan, an agricultural region surrounded by mountains and volcanoes, is reflected in some songs of the tembang Sunda.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zanten|first=Wim van|publisher=KITLV Press|title=Sundanese Music in the Cianjuran Style|year=1989}}</ref>

[[Kacapi suling]] is tembang Sunda minus vocal. [[Tarawangsa]] is a genuine popular art is performed on ensemble consists of tarawangsa (a violin with an end pin) and the jentreng (a kind of seven-stringed zither). It is accompanied by a secret dance called Jentreng. The dance is a part of a ritual celebrating the goddess of paddy Dewi Sri. Its ceremonial significance is associated with a ritual of thanksgiving associated with the rice harvest. Tarawangsa can also be played for healing or even purely for entertainment.

[[File:Angklung-arumba.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Angklung]] is one of the most famous musical instruments in West Java]]
The three main types of Sundanese bamboo ensembles are [[angklung]], [[calung]], [[karinding]] and arumba. The exact features of each ensemble vary according to context, related instruments, and relative popularity. Angklung is a generic term for sets of tuned, shaken bamboo rattles. Angklung consists of a frame upon which hang several different lengths of hollow bamboo. Angklungs are played like handbells, with each instrument played to a different note. Angklung rattles are played in interlocking patterns, usually with only one or two instruments played per person. The ensemble is used in Sundanese processions, sometimes with trance or acrobatics. 

Performed at life-cycle rituals and feasts (hajat), angklung is believed to maintain balance and harmony in the village. In its most modern incarnation, angklung is performed in schools as an aid to learning music. The Angklung received international attention when Daeng Soetigna, from Bandung, expanded the angklung notations not only to play traditional pélog or sléndro scales but also diatonic scale in 1938. Since then, angklung is often played together with other Western musical instruments in an orchestra. One of the first well-known performances of angklung in an orchestra was during the [[Bandung Conference]] in 1955. Like those in angklung, the instruments of the calung ensemble are of bamboo, but each consists of several differently tuned tubes fixed onto a piece of bamboo; the player holds the instrument in his left hand and strikes it with a beater held in his right. 

The highest-pitched calung has the highest number of tubes and the densest musical activity; the lowest-pitched, with two tubes, has the least. Calung is nearly always associated with earthy humour, and is played by men. Arumba refers to a set of diatonically tuned bamboo xylophones, often played by women. It is frequently joined by modern instruments, including a drum set, electric guitar, bass, and keyboards.

=== Theatre ===
[[File:Dalang.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wayang Golek]], a traditional Sundanese puppetry.]]
''Wayang golek'' is a traditional form of puppetry from Sunda. Unlike the better-known leather shadow puppets (''[[wayang kulit]]'') found in the rest of Java and Bali, ''wayang golek'' puppets are made from wood and are three-dimensional, rather than two. They use a banana palm in which the puppets stand, behind which one puppeteer (''dalang'') is accompanied by his ''gamelan'' orchestra with up to 20 musicians. The ''gamelan'' uses a five-note scale as opposed to the seven-note western scale. The musicians are guided by the drummer, who in turn is guided by signals from the puppet master dalang gives to change the mood or pace required. ''Wayang golek'' are used by the Sundanese to tell the epic play "Mahabarata", and various other morality-type plays. [[Sandiwara|Sandiwara Sunda]] is a type folk teather performed in [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] and presenting [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] themes, folklores and stories.

=== Dance ===
[[File:Jaipongan Bunga Tanjung 01.jpg |thumb|right|Jaipongan dance performance accompanied by Sundanese degung mixed with modern instruments.]]
{{Main|Sundanese dance}}
Sundanese dance shows the influence of the many groups that have traded and settled in the area over the centuries, and includes variations from graceful to dynamic syncopated drumming patterns, quick wrist flicks, sensual hip movements, and fast shoulder and torso isolations.
''[[Jaipongan]]'' is probably the most popular traditional social dance of Sundanese people. It can be performed in solo, grups, or pair.
The ''Tari Merak'' ([[Peacock dance|Peafowl Dance]]) is a female dance inspired by the movements of a peafowl and its feathers blended with the classical movements of the Sundanese dance.

==Cuisine==
{{main|Sundanese cuisine}}
[[File:Sundanese Food 02.JPG|thumb|left|A typical modest Sundanese meal consists of steamed rice, fried salted fish, ''[[sayur asem]]'' (vegetable with tamarind based soup), ''[[lalab]] [[sambal]]'' (raw vegetables salad with chili paste) and ''[[karedok]]'' (vegetable salad with peanuts paste).]]
[[Sundanese cuisine]] is one of the most famous traditional food in Indonesia, and it is also easily found in most Indonesian cities. The Sundanese food is characterised by its freshness; the famous ''[[lalab]]'' (raw vegetables salad) eaten with ''[[sambal]]'' (chili paste), and also ''[[karedok]]'' (peanuts paste) demonstrate the Sundanese fondness for fresh raw vegetables. Similar to other ethnic groups in Indonesia, Sundanese people eat [[rice]] for almost every meal. The Sundanese like to say, "If you have not eaten rice, then you have not eaten at all." Rice is prepared in hundreds of different ways. However, it is simple steamed rice that serves as the centrepiece of all meals.

Next to [[steamed rice]], the side dishes of [[vegetables]], [[fish]], or [[meat]] are added to provide a variety of tastes as well as for protein, mineral and nutrient intake. These side dishes are grilled, fried, steamed or boiled and spiced with any combination of garlic, [[galangal]] (a plant of the ginger family), turmeric, coriander, ginger, and lemongrass. The herb-rich food wrapped and cooked inside banana leaf called ''[[pepes]]'' (Sundanese: ''pais'') is popular among Sundanese people. ''Pepes'' are available in many varieties according to their ingredients; carp fish, anchovies, minced meat with eggs, mushroom, tofu or oncom. ''[[Oncom]]'' is a fermented peanut-based ingredient that is prevalent within Sundanese cuisine, just like its counterpart, Tempe, which is popular among Javanese people. Usually, the food itself is not too spicy, but it is served with a boiling sauce made by grinding chilli peppers and garlic together. On the coast, saltwater fish are common; in the mountains, fish tend to be either pond-raised carp or goldfish. A well-known Sundanese dish is ''lalapan'', which consists only of raw vegetables, such as [[papaya]] leaves, [[cucumber]], [[eggplant]], and [[bitter melon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.kasundaan.org/id/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&layout=blog&id=14&Itemid=94|title = Kuliner|access-date = 24 October 2011|author = KAsep|publisher = Kasundaan.org|language = id|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726214553/http://www.kasundaan.org/id/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&layout=blog&id=14&Itemid=94|archive-date = 26 July 2011}}</ref>
