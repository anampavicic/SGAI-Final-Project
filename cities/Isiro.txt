'''Isiro''' (pronounced {{IPA-xx|iˈsiro|}}) is the capital of [[Haut-Uele Province]] in the northeastern part of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. It lies between the [[Tropical rainforest|equatorial forest]] and the [[savannah]] and its main resource is coffee. Isiro's population is estimated at approximately 182,000.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-03-04 |title=Updates (Maps / Infographics) {{!}} ReliefWeb |url=https://reliefweb.int/updates?list=Updates%20%28Maps%20/%20Infographics%29&view=maps |access-date=2024-03-05 |website=reliefweb.int |language=en |archive-date=2024-01-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240124173040/https://reliefweb.int/updates?list=Updates%20%28Maps%20/%20Infographics%29&view=maps |url-status=live }}</ref> Most people speak, Pa-Zande ([[Zande language]]), [[Lingala]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and which is somehow uncommon.

==History==
Isiro was named ''Paulis'' after colonel, later diplomat, [[Albert Paulis]] when it was part of the [[Belgian Congo]]. The city was developed in 1934 and reached its peak in 1957.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2007-09-28 |title=Informations générales |url=http://www.uniuele.net/reperes_geo.htm |access-date=2024-03-05 |archive-date=2007-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928040119/http://www.uniuele.net/reperes_geo.htm |url-status=bot: unknown }}</ref> In the troubled days of Congo's independence and its aftermath, operation ''Black Dragoon'' brought fighting between Belgian paratroopers and local [[Simba Rebellion|Simba]] militias.

In 1998, Isiro became the home of a newly created [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]-operated university called ''[[University of Uélé|Université de l'Uélé]]''. It is the third city in Orientale province (after Kisangani and Bunia) to welcome a university.

IN 2015 Isiro became the capital of the Province of Haut-Uele, as governor [[ Lola KIsanga]] 2015-2019.

IN 2023 Isiro' population knew their first social media [[ Isiro Cultures]] that has more than 90k in Facebook,..

IN 2024 ISIRO HAS MORE THAN 400.000 POPULATION.

==Transport==
Isiro is served by [[Matari Airport]], a national airport with flights to Kinshasa, the capital. The isolated [[narrow-gauge railway|narrow gauge]] [[Vicicongo line]] to the river port of [[Bumba, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Bumba]] on the Congo River is not currently operational. The dirt roads to and from Isiro allow commercial trade with [[Uganda]] and [[South Sudan]], in principle, but may be impassable in the wet season.
