A major port on the [[Illinois River]], Peoria is a trading and shipping center for a large agricultural area that produces corn, soybeans, and livestock. Although the economy is well diversified, the city's traditional manufacturing industries remain important and produce earthmoving equipment, metal products, lawn-care equipment, labels, steel towers, farm equipment, building materials, steel, wire, and chemicals.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Peoria-Illinois |title=Peoria {{!}} Illinois, United States |website=Encyclopaedia Britannica |language=en |access-date=June 20, 2019 |archive-date=June 20, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190620094425/https://www.britannica.com/place/Peoria-Illinois |url-status=live }}</ref> Until 2018, Peoria was the global and national headquarters for [[heavy equipment]] and [[engine]] manufacturer [[Caterpillar Inc.]], one of the 30 companies composing the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]], and listed on the Fortune 100; the company relocated its headquarters to [[Deerfield, Illinois]] in 2018, and then [[Irving, Texas]], in 2022.<ref name="WSJMove">{{cite news |title=Caterpillar to Move Headquarters to Chicago Suburb of Deerfield, Ill. |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/caterpillar-to-move-headquarters-to-chicago-suburb-of-deerfield-ill-1492640649 |access-date=July 5, 2017 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |archive-date=June 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170601183924/https://www.wsj.com/articles/caterpillar-to-move-headquarters-to-chicago-suburb-of-deerfield-ill-1492640649 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="SJRMove">{{cite news |title=Caterpillar's move to Deerfield made official in SEC filing |url=http://www.sj-r.com/news/20180109/caterpillars-move-to-deerfield-made-official-in-sec-filing |access-date=August 5, 2018 |newspaper=[[The State Journal-Register]] |archive-date=August 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180806054845/http://www.sj-r.com/news/20180109/caterpillars-move-to-deerfield-made-official-in-sec-filing |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city is associated with the phrase "[[Will it play in Peoria?]]", which may have originated from the [[vaudeville]] era and is often spuriously attributed to [[Groucho Marx]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Peoria, Illinois}}
Peoria is the oldest European settlement in Illinois, as explorers first ventured up the Illinois River from the Mississippi. The lands that eventually would become Peoria were first settled by Europeans in 1680, when French explorers [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] and [[Henri de Tonti]] constructed [[Fort Crevecoeur]].<ref name="phs-fr"/> This fort would later burn to the ground, and in 1813, Fort Clark, Illinois was built. When the [[Peoria County|County of Peoria]] was organized in 1825, Fort Clark was officially named Peoria.<ref>[https://www.peoria.com/community/history.php Peoria Illinois History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719114929/https://www.peoria.com/community/history.php |date=July 19, 2018 }}. peoria.com.

Peoria was named after the [[Peoria tribe]], a member of the [[Illinois Confederation]]. The original meaning of the word is uncertain.<ref>Scheetz, George H. "Peoria."

The city did not have a mayor, though they had a village president, Rudolphus Rouse, who served from 1835 to 1836. The first Chief of Police, John B Lishk, was appointed in 1837. The city was incorporated on April 21, 1845. This was the end of a village president and the start of the mayoral system, with the first mayor being William Hale.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rice |first=James Montgomery |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmcUAAAAYAAJ&dq=peoria+il+first+mayor+%22william+hale%22&pg=PA339 |title=Peoria City and County, Illinois: A Record of Settlement, Organization, Progress and Achievement |date=1912 |publisher=S.

===Township of the City of Peoria===
[[File:Map highlighting Peoria City Township, Peoria County, Illinois.svg|thumb|upright|Outline of the Township of the City of Peoria in Peoria County]]

The Township of the City of Peoria (also City of Peoria Township) is a separate government from the City of Peoria, and performs the functions of [[civil township]] government in most of the city. The township was created by the Peoria County Board to match the boundaries of the City of Peoria, which until then had overlapped portions of Peoria Township (now [[West Peoria Township, Peoria County, Illinois|West Peoria Township]]) and [[Richwoods Township, Peoria County, Illinois|Richwoods Township]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EPpCAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Town%20of%20the%20City%20of%20Peoria%22&pg=PA457 |title=Biennial Report of the Attorney General of the State of Illinois |page=457 |author=[[Illinois Attorney General|Illinois Attorney General's Office]] |date=December 1908 |publisher=Illinois State Journal Co. |location=Springfield, Illinois |access-date=July 28, 2019 |archive-date=December 13, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231213072059/https://books.google.com/books?id=EPpCAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Town%20of%20the%20City%20of%20Peoria%22&pg=PA457#v=snippet&q=%22Town%20of%20the%20City%20of%20Peoria%22&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref> The border of the township grew with the Peoria city limits until 1990, when it was frozen at its current boundaries, containing about {{cvt|53|sqmi|sp=us}};<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.peoriatownship.com/boundary |title=Peoria Township Boundary |publisher=City of Peoria Township |location=Peoria, Illinois |access-date=July 28, 2019 |archive-date=July 29, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190729044029/https://www.peoriatownship.com/boundary |url-status=live }}</ref> the City of Peoria itself has continued expanding outside the City of Peoria Township borders into [[Kickapoo Township, Peoria County, Illinois|Kickapoo]], [[Limestone Township, Peoria County, Illinois|Limestone]], [[Medina Township, Peoria County, Illinois|Medina]], and [[Radnor Township, Peoria County, Illinois|Radnor]] township.

[[File:McClugage Bridge Peoria-820.JPG|thumb|The twin steel truss bridges known as McClugage Bridge, spanning the Illinois River at Peoria]]

====Interstate and U.S. routes====
The Peoria area is served by three [[Interstate highway]]s: [[Interstate 74]], which runs from northwest to southeast through the downtown area, [[Interstate 474]], a southern bypass of I-74 through portions of Peoria and the suburbs of [[Bartonville, Illinois|Bartonville]] and [[Creve Coeur, Illinois|Creve Coeur]], and [[Interstate 155 (Illinois)|Interstate 155]], which runs south from I-74 in Morton to [[Interstate 55]] in Lincoln which connects to Springfield and St. Louis. I-74 crosses over the Illinois River via the [[Murray Baker Bridge]], while I-474 crosses via the [[Shade-Lohmann Bridge]]. The nearest metropolitan centers accessible on I-74 are the [[Quad Cities]] to the west, and [[Bloomington-Normal, Illinois|Bloomington-Normal]] to the east.

From 2004 to 2006, Interstate 74 between Interstate 474 on the west and [[Illinois Route 8]] on the east was reconstructed as part of the [[Interstate 74 in Illinois#History|Upgrade 74]] project.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Illinois Department of Transportation]] |title=Upgrade 74 |url=http://www.upgrade74.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116030630/http://www.upgrade74.com/ |archive-date=November 16, 2006 |url-status=dead |access-date=March 14, 2022 |date=January 4, 2007}}</ref> In addition, [[U.S. Route 150]] serves as the main arterial for the northern portion of the Peoria area, becoming War Memorial Drive before heading west towards Kickapoo. It enters from the [[McClugage Bridge]]; east of the bridge, then runs southeast to [[Morton, Illinois|Morton]]. [[U.S. Route 24 in Illinois#Quincy to East Peoria|U.S. Route 24]] runs concurrently with Interstate 474 in the southwest portion of the city.

====State routes====
The following state routes run through Peoria:

* [[Illinois Route 6]] runs along the northwestern portion of the city as an extension of I-474. It is a four-lane freeway that runs from the I-74/474 intersection northeast to Illinois Route 29 south of [[Chillicothe, Illinois|Chillicothe]]. It is marked as a north–south road.
* [[Illinois Route 8]] roughly parallels I-74 to the south. It enters Peoria from [[Elmwood, Illinois|Elmwood]] and runs southeast through the city, passing just southwest of the downtown area. Illinois 8 crosses into East Peoria via the [[Cedar Street Bridge]] with 116. Illinois 8 is marked as an east–west road.
* [[Illinois Route 29]] runs through Peoria along the Illinois River from Chillicothe through downtown Peoria. It then joins Interstate 74 across the Murray Baker Bridge. Illinois 29 is marked as a north–south road, and is called Galena Road north of U.S. 150.
* [[Illinois Route 40]] (formerly 88) enters Peoria from the north as Knoxville Avenue. It runs south through the center of the city and exits southeast over the [[Bob Michel Bridge]]. Illinois 40 is marked as a north–south road.
* [[Illinois Route 91]] briefly enters Peoria at the intersection with U.S. 150 in the far northwestern portion of the city. Traffic on Illinois 91 mainly accesses [[The Shoppes at Grand Prairie]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shoppesatgrandprairie.com/directions |title=Directions |website=Shoppesatgrandprairie.com |access-date=September 16, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407075217/http://www.shoppesatgrandprairie.com/directions |archive-date=April 7, 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> or continues to Dunlap.
* [[Illinois Route 116]] enters from the west at [[Bellevue, Illinois|Bellevue]]. It runs directly east and crosses into East Peoria over the Cedar Street Bridge.

The planned [[Illinois Route 336]] project will also connect Illinois 336 with I-474 between Illinois 8 and Illinois 116. Construction on the segment nearest Peoria has not started, nor has funding been allocated.

====Rail transportation====
Peoria remains a major freight hub but its minor passenger service has been waning since the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYUqu60dm_c&t=1s|title=Classic Trains in the Land of Lincoln: Dick Neumiller's Central Illinois Photography|publisher=[[Center for Railroad Photography & Art]]|access-date=April 24, 2024}}</ref>

Metro Peoria is served by ten [[common carrier]] [[railroad]]s. Four are [[Class I railroad]]s: [[BNSF]], [[Canadian National]], [[Norfolk Southern]] and [[Union Pacific]]. The latter has a north–south oriented line which skirts the west edge of the city but a line branches off of it to enter Peoria. One [[Class II railroad|Class II/Regional]], [[Iowa Interstate Railroad|Iowa Interstate]], serves the city, coming out of [[Bureau Junction]], Illinois. Five [[Class III railroad|Class III/Shortline]] railroads: [[Central Illinois Railroad]], which operates a portion of the city-owned Peoria, Peoria Heights and Western Railroad; three [[Genesee & Wyoming]]-owned operations: [[Toledo, Peoria & Western Railway]], which runs next to US 24 east to [[Logansport, Indiana]] (formally owned by [[Rail America]]), [[Illinois & Midland Railroad]] (the former Chicago & Illinois Midland, comes up from Springfield and Havana) and [[Tazewell & Peoria Railroad]] (leases the [[Peoria & Pekin Union Railway]] from its owners Canadian National, Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific); Pioneer Railcorp's [[Keokuk Junction Railway]] (which now owns the Toledo, Peoria and Western's West End from Lomax and La Harpe in Western Illinois, plus the branch from Keokuk).<ref>{{cite web |title=Toledo, Peoria & Western Railway TPW #769 |url=https://www.up.com/customers/shortline/profiles_t-z/tpw/index.htm |publisher=[[Union Pacific]] |access-date=March 14, 2022 |archive-date=October 6, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221006083205/https://www.up.com/customers/shortline/profiles_t-z/tpw/index.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Several Midwestern railroads served [[Peoria Union Station]] until 1955. The [[Rock Island Railroad]] operated trains into its [[Peoria station (Rock Island Line)|Rock Island Depot]] until 1978, when they discontinued the ''Peoria Rocket''. [[East Peoria, Illinois|East Peoria]] was served by Amtrak's ''[[Prairie Marksman]]'' (Chicago–East Peoria) until 1981. Peoria is currently the second largest city in Illinois without passenger rail service; the closest passenger stations are [[Galesburg station (Amtrak)|Galesburg]] (served by [[Amtrak]]'s Chicago–Los Angeles ''[[Southwest Chief]]'') and [[Uptown Station|Bloomington]] (served by Amtrak's Chicago-St. Louis ''[[Lincoln Service]]''). A study of East Peoria–Bloomington passenger rail service was published in 2011. Plans for the proposed service, which would have connected with Amtrak's [[Lincoln Service]] at Bloomington, were abandoned due to financial considerations.<ref name="pjs-amtrak-peoria-chicago">{{Cite web |last=Dalton |first=Alex |date=July 21, 2022 |title=The stars have aligned: New plan revealed for passenger rail from Peoria to Chicago |url=https://www.pjstar.com/story/news/local/2022/07/21/chicago-to-peoria-blueprint-for-new-amtrak-service-in-illinois/65379235007/ |access-date=August 3, 2022 |website=Peoria Journal Star |language=en-US |archive-date=August 7, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220807182727/https://www.pjstar.com/story/news/local/2022/07/21/chicago-to-peoria-blueprint-for-new-amtrak-service-in-illinois/65379235007/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

A study of Peoria–Chicago passenger rail service was published in July 2022. The study, conducted by [[Illinois Department of Transportation|IDOT]] at the request of a Passenger Rail Committee established in August 2021, estimated that startup costs for the proposed service would be $2.54 billion. The service would be operated by Amtrak and would have intermediate stops at LaSalle-Peru, [[North Utica, Illinois|Utica]], [[Ottawa, Illinois|Ottawa]], [[Morris, Illinois|Morris]], and [[Joliet, Illinois|Joliet]]. The trip between Peoria and Chicago would take about {{frac|2|1|2}} hours. Committee members, who met with federal transportation officials and Amtrak's CEO, were hopeful about securing funding.<ref name="pjs-amtrak-peoria-chicago" />

====Public transportation====
Public bus service is provided by the [[Greater Peoria Mass Transit District]], which operates 17 bus routes under the name CityLink that serve the city, [[Illinois Central College]], and much of [[East Peoria, Illinois|East Peoria]], [[Peoria Heights, Illinois|Peoria Heights]], [[West Peoria, Illinois|West Peoria]] in addition to points between Peoria and [[Pekin, Illinois|Pekin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ridecitylink.org/maps.htm |title=CityLink maps |date=May 16, 2007 |access-date=June 19, 2007 |publisher=Greater Peoria Mass Transit District (CityLink) |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709031019/http://www.ridecitylink.org/maps.htm |archive-date=July 9, 2007}}</ref>

==Peoria in popular culture==
The theme of Peoria as the archetypal example of [[Middle America (United States)|middle American]] culture runs throughout American culture, appearing in movies and books, on television and radio, and in countless advertisements as either a filler place name or the representative of mainstream taste, hence the phrase "[[Will it play in Peoria?]]"<ref>{{cite web |title=Will it Play in Peoria? |url=http://storycorps.org/will-it-play-in-peoria/ |publisher=[[StoryCorps]] |access-date=September 17, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713070134/http://storycorps.org/will-it-play-in-peoria/ |archive-date=July 13, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Peoria, IL |url=https://www.forbes.com/places/il/peoria/ |access-date=September 17, 2014 |work=[[Forbes]] |archive-date=September 1, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140901145024/http://www.forbes.com/places/il/peoria/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Borcover |first1=Alfred |title=Play in Peoria |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/2010/04/09/play-in-peoria/ |access-date=September 17, 2014 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=April 9, 2010 |archive-date=May 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504022740/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-04-09/news/ct-trav-0411-peoria-20100409_1_illinois-river-warehouse-upscale-condos |url-status=live }}</ref>
