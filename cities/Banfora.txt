'''Banfora''' is a city in southwestern [[Burkina Faso]], with a population of 117,452 (2019 census)<ref name=pop/> making it the sixth most populous city in Burkina Faso. It is the capital of the [[Comoé Province|Comoe]] province. The city lies {{convert|85|km}} south-west of [[Bobo-Dioulasso]], on the [[Rail transport in Burkina Faso|Abidjan – Ouagadougou Railway]]. The [[Cascades de Karfiguéla]] are a series of waterfalls close to Banfora.

==History==
[[File:Les.Colonies.françaises.Helio.Sadag.1931.Flammarion.Haute-Volta. Régio de Banfora. Le battage du riz (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|A village scene from the area around Banfora, 1931]]
[[File:Maarten van der Bent Banfora.jpg|thumb|right|Street in Banfora]]
The first settlers were the Karaboro who with the Gouin and Turkas constitute the city's main ethnic groups. They are all from the south of Burkina Faso.

In 1903 the French colonialist forces created a military post at Banfora and one year later created an administrative position there. In 1905 a road was built linking Banfora to [[Bobo-Dioulasso]] and in 1931 a railway was built to the town.

==Economy==
The economy has grown around the [[sugar cane]] industry. The city is also an important market town and there are hotels which support a small tourism industry linked to the [[Cascades de Karfiguéla]].

==Transportation==
[[File:Https- www.flickr.com photos maartenvdbent 12567779015, Banfora Gare.jpg|thumb|left|Banfora train station]]
The city has a railroad station along the [[Rail transport in Burkina Faso|Abidjan – Ouagadougou Railway]]. As of June 2014 ''Sitarail'' operated a passenger train along the line three times a week in each direction.<ref>European Rail Timetable, Summer 2014 Edition, (journey time is 43 to 48 hours)</ref> It is a way station for transport to and from Côte d'Ivoire as it is the last city in Burkina Faso before the border. The paved road from Bobo-Dioulasso continues to the border and cargo will often stop at [[Niangoloko]] before reaching customs.

==Education==
Banfora has 19 primary schools, two high schools, four private colleges and the College of Sainte Thérèse.

==Healthcare==
The city has a regional hospital (CHR), a maternal and infant protection unit and three pharmacies. Traditional medicine is also practiced and there is a center for traditional therapies. 
==Demographics==
The main ethnic groups are the [[Gouin people|Gouin]], the [[Karaboro]] and the [[Turka people|Turka]]. The most commonly used languages for communication between people of different ethnicities living in Banfora are [[Dyula language|Dioula]] and [[French language|French]].

== Climate ==
[[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies its climate as [[tropical wet and dry climate|tropical wet and dry]] (Aw).
