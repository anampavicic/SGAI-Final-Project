==Geography==
Lipetsk Oblast borders with [[Ryazan Oblast]] (NE), [[Tambov Oblast]] (E), [[Voronezh Oblast]] (S), [[Kursk Oblast]] (SW), [[Oryol Oblast]] (W), and [[Tula Oblast]] (NW).

==History==
According to archaeologists and historians, the territory of the modern Lipetsk Oblast has been inhabited since ancient times. Even before the arrival of the Mongol-Tatar troops, the area had the following settlements:  Yelets, Dobrinsk (presumed to be the village of Dobroye) Dubok (presumed to be the village Dubki) ([[Dankovsky District]]), Staroye Gorodische (presumably Bogorodskoye of the Dankovsky district) Vorgol (destroyed), Onuza (destroyed), Voronozh (destroyed), Lipets (destroyed) and others. During the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']], many fortified cities were destroyed.

At the beginning of the period belonged to the disintegration of the [[Principality of Chernigov]]. After 1202, after the fall of Chernigov, Prince [[Igor Svyatoslavich]] [[Yelets]] arose, Lipetsk and Vorgolskoe fiefdoms. Taking advantage of the weakness of the Principality of Chernigov, Ryazan princes seized all the lands of the upper Don, Voronezh River and annexed them. The newly acquired territories in the south of the Ryazan principality subsequently used the name "Ryazan Ukraine."

The revival of the territory began after the expulsion of the nomads. In a relatively short period of time (end of the 16th and early 17th centuries) were built fortified city: Duncan Talitskii jail, Eletskaya fortress Lebedian. In 1635, construction began on a strong fortified line - Belgorod defense line, which in the Lipetsk region within a modern fortress stood out: Good, Sokolsk and Usman.
