== Geography ==
The area is found in the Mid-Eastern portion of mainland Tanzania and is situated between latitudes 5° 58' and 10' south of the [[equator]] and between longitudes 35° 25' and 38° 30' east greenwich. 4,623,005 acres, or 4.9% of the area of Tanzania's Mainland, is the size of the Morogoro region (94,278,400 ha). The majority of the total land area, 1,772,597 ha (38.3%), is made up of [[arable land]] used for crop cultivation. This is followed by [[Pasture|pasture land]], which took up 371,537 ha (8.0%), and forest land, which made up 330,277 ha (7.1%) of the region's total area. Water bodies cover the remaining 2,140,625 ha (46.3 percent of the total land), which is also where settlements are located. Seven additional Regions encircle it. The regions of Morogoro and Tanga and Manyara share a border to the north. It borders the Ruvuma and Lindi regions to the east and southeast, respectively. It borders the Dodoma, Njombe and Iringa regions to the west and southwest, respectively.<ref name="auto2">{{cite report |title=Morogoro Region Socio-economic Profile 2020 |url=https://morogoro.go.tz/storage/app/uploads/public/621/cc0/3de/621cc03deb0c6900103117.pdf|year=2020 |type=Regional Guide |publisher= Morogoro Government, Tanzania|access-date=13 October 2022 |location=Morogoro Region |language=en }}</ref>

The Morogoro region has a total size of 73,039 square kilometers, which is split between land (70,967 square kilometers, or 97.2 percent of the total area), and water (2,073&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> or 2.8 percent). As of 2012, [[Ulanga District]] is the largest district,[[Malinyi District|Malinyi]] DC comes in second with 17.0 percent of the region's total land area, followed by [[Morogoro Rural District|Morogoro]] DC with 16.1 percent. [[Kilosa District]] comes in first with 18.6 percent. [[Morogoro Urban District|Morogoro Municipal]] was the district with the smallest land size (531&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> or 10.7%), followed by [[Gairo District|Gairo]] DC with (1,851&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> or 2.5 percent). Different scenarios exist in Kilosa DC, Malinyi DC, [[Ifakara]] TC, Ulanga DC, Morogoro MC, and Gairo DC, with all of their respective territories being completely covered by land. While [[Mvomero District|Mvomero]] DC (1,882&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) has the most water area in the area. At Mlimba DC, there is the smallest water area (70&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). According to topographical and ecological zones, the region's soils differ.<ref name=":0">{{cite report |title=Morogoro Region Socio-economic Profile 2020 |url=https://morogoro.go.tz/storage/app/uploads/public/621/cc0/3de/621cc03deb0c6900103117.pdf|year=2020 |type=Regional Guide |publisher= Morogoro Government, Tanzania|access-date=13 October 2022  |location=Morogoro Region|language=en }}</ref>

The predominant type of soils in mountainous and hilly places are [[oxisol]]s, which are often poor in nitrogen and phosphorus. [[Alluvium|Alluvial]] soils, which are naturally fertile, are typically what define valleys and lowlands. Woodlands and grasslands frequently have sandy and clay soils. Numerous crops, including [[maize]], [[Paddy field|paddy]], beans, several [[cassava]] species, sweet and round potatoes, amaranths, vegetables, sugarcane, simsim, cocoa, cotton, cashew nuts, etc., are produced in the area due to the soil conditions.<ref name="auto">{{cite report |url=https://morogoro.go.tz/storage/app/uploads/public/621/cc0/3de/621cc03deb0c6900103117.pdf |title=Morogoro Region Socio-economic Profile 2020 |publisher=Morogoro Government, Tanzania |location=Morogoro Region |language=en |access-date=13 October 2022 |year=2020 |type=Regional Guide}}</ref>

There are 143 rivers inside and traversing the region. The Morogoro region is traversed by a number of rivers and tributaries that come from the mountains. Many rivers that flow from hills to lowlands in the valleys make up the region's drainage system. [[Kilombero River|Kilombero]], [[Great Ruaha River|Great Ruaha]], [[Wami River|Wami]], Luwegu, Ruvu, [[Ngerengere River|Ngerengere]], Mkata, Mkondoa, and Mkindo are a few of the important rivers.<ref name="auto"/>

===Climate===
The Morogoro Region has a [[Tropical savanna climate|tropical savannah]] climate with regular rainfall. In lowlands, the annual average temperature ranges from 18&nbsp;°C to 30&nbsp;°C. Nearly the entire year, the Region receives moderate temperatures of about 25&nbsp;°C. Typically, the cooler season lasts from July to September. The Region typically experiences a bi-modal rainfall pattern, with long rains from March to May and short rains from November to January. The yearly rainfall ranges from 600 to 1800 millimeters.<ref name="auto"/>

While the leeward sides of the [[Uluguru Mountains]] often remain dry with yearly rainfall of less than 600mm, the eastern parts of the mountains receive extremely high rainfall of up to 2,850mm. The Gairo and Mamboya divisions in the North of Kilosa District and the Ngerengere division in the Morogoro District are those that receive the least rainfall. The Mahenge and [[Udzungwa Mountains|Udzungwa mountain]] ranges, which are high in elevation and include substantial forest reserves, also have a significant impact on the region's climate, particularly in the southern Ulanga and Kilombero Districts.<ref name="auto2"/>

==Economy==
Agriculture and related industries make up the bulk of the region's economy. The main pursuits are small-scale agriculture (production of food and cash crops for [[Subsistence agriculture|sustenance]]), cattle raising (mostly with [[Zebu|indigenous livestock]]), and plantations and estates ([[sisal]], [[sugar]]). The modest, capital-intensive urban sector is expanding, though, and its primary activities include manufacturing and providing services like offices, hotels, petty trade, and traditional fishing, which is done along the Kilombero and Wami rivers as well as the Mindu Dam.

Lukande Village in the Ulanga District and Matombo in the Morogoro Rural District both have some mining activity. Three different mineral categories, including gemstones, building materials (such as sand, gravel, and stones), and industrial minerals (such as [[limestone]], [[mica]], and [[graphite]]) are found and mined within the region .The region's main economic sector is agriculture, employing about 80% - 90% of the workforce.

The sisal estates, vast [[rice]] farms, and sugar estates in Dakawa in Morogoro Rural District, Mngeta in [[Mlimba|Mlimba District]], and Kilangali in Kilosa District are examples of large industrial and commercial [[plantation]] farms. The two main crops for staple foods are maize and paddy. [[Sorghum]], [[sweet potato]]es, beans, cassava, [[millet]], groundnuts, tomatoes, fruits, and vegetables are some of the other food crops grown in the area. Cotton, coffee, sisal, onions, oil seeds (such simsim and sunflower), and some cocoa along the mountain slopes are the main economic crops in the region.<ref name="auto"/>

===Agriculture===
The Region's main economic sector is [[agriculture]] with about 80–90% of the labor force getting employment from this. Farmers of different sizes participate in agriculture. Morogoro Region is also Tanzanian's [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] capital, with 20% of the farmers there growing cocoa. Over 70,000 thousand tons of cocoa beans are produced in Tanzania with the majority coming from Morogoro Region and a vast majority of it grown organically.<ref>{{cite report |title= From Morogoro with Cocoa Love|url=https://tanzaniatimes.net/from-morogoro-with-cocoa-love/|year=2020 |type=News article |publisher= Tanzania Times|access-date=13 October 2022 |language=en }}</ref>

The sisal estates, vast paddy farms, and sugar estates in Dakawa, Morogoro Rural District, Mngeta, Mlimba District, and Kilangali, Kilosa District are examples of large farms. The two main crops for staple foods are maize and paddy. Sorghum, sweet potatoes, beans, cassava, millet, groundnuts, tomatoes, fruits, and vegetables are some of the other food crops grown in the area. Cotton, coffee, sisal, onions, oil seeds (such simsim and sunflower), and some cocoa along the mountain slopes are the main economic crops in the region.<ref name="auto"/>

Statistics on employment by industry show how important various economic activities are in terms of employment. More than half (76 percent) of all jobs in the Morogoro Region will be in the education sector between 2016 and 2020. Agriculture and livestock are second with 4.7 percent of employment, followed by the health sector with 13.2 percent.

===Industry===
More than 19 medium-scale companies and well over 100 small-scale industries operated in the Morogoro region between 1988 and 1990. In total, these businesses employed almost 15,000 people. Due to cash flow issues, bad management, and a lack of markets for finished goods, several of these sectors have shut down or are on the verge of doing so since the early 1990s.

As a result, 12,000 workers are thought to have lost their jobs. These industries include weaving, the processing of fibers, metal fabrication, ceramics, the processing of oils, milling, the manufacture of carts, the processing of fruits and vegetables, and many more. Some major industrial companies were, The Morogoro 81 Tobacco Factory, Morogoro Tanneries Ltd., Morogoro Shoes, and MOPROCO.
