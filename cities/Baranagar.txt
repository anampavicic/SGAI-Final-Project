Baranagar is a major industrial centre for the manufacture of agricultural and industrial machinery, chemicals, [[castor oil]], and matches; Baranagar is also home to numerous cotton-processing companies, offset & digital printing companies and book publishers.

==Etymology==
The word ''Baranagar'' derives from the Bengali term ''Barahanagore'' ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]: বরাহনগর), meaning "City of the Hogs". (বরাহ: hog, নগর: city) 
[[Streynsham Master]] who visited the area in 1676 spoke of the hog factory where about 3,000 hogs a year were slaughtered and salted for export.<ref name=Cotton/>

There are several explanations for the etymology of this name:

* [[File:De Barros Map of Bengal.jpg|thumb|317x317px|Map of Bengal by De Barros in 1550 showing "Bernagar" which refers to Baranagar]]''Baranagar'' or ''Barahanagar'', meaning the "big" (Bara) and "town or land" (nagar) of the "pig" (baraha).<ref name="Baranagar Demographics"/>
* ''Baranagar'' might be named after [[Varaha]] avatar of [[Vishnu]].

The earliest reference of Baranagar can be found in Sri Sri Chaitanya Bhagabat written by Sri Brindaban Das where it was said that [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] came to Baranagar in 1512. He writes:
<poem><blockquote><span lang="bn" dir="ltr">হেন মতে পাণিহাটী গ্রাম ধন্য করি।</span> 
<span lang="bn" dir="ltr">আছিলেন কথোদিন শ্রীগৌরাঙ্গ হরি ॥</span> 
<span lang="bn" dir="ltr">তবে প্রভু আইলেন বরাহনগরে।</span> 
<span lang="bn" dir="ltr">মহাভাগ্যবন্ত এক ব্রাহ্মণের ঘরে ॥</span>

<span lang="bn" dir="ltr">ইহা বিনে আর কোন না করিহ কার্য।</span></blockquote></poem>
References to Baranagar can be found in many literary texts dating to 17th and 18th centuries. Even maps made by Dutch and Portuguese had references to Baranagar as "Bernagar" or "Barrenger".

Portuguese colonist first established their business camp here, which was in existence till 1862. Dutch settlers established their ‘Kuthi’ or office for business. Dutch supremacy ended with the arisen of British power in Bengal. M/s. Colvin Cow II Co. was the pioneer of industrial Baranagar. They founded a Sugar Mill near Alambazar. Later George Henderson founded Borneo Jute Factory at that site.<ref>“Industrial Railways and Locomotives of India and South Asia” compiled by Simon Darvill.

Reference: Entry WB125 page ....</ref> In 1859, the factory was renamed Baranagar Jute Factory and is still in existence. The Baranagar Jute Factory was the
first mechanical Jute Factory in India. During the two World Wars, many engineering factories were set up in Baranagar, and the town became famous as Industrial City. To provide civic amenities, North Suburban Municipality was formed in 1869 consisting of Chitpur and Cossipore (presently under Kolkata M.C.), all mouzas of present Baranagar Municipal Area along with Kamarhati, Ariadaha and Dakshineswar mouzas of present Kamarhati Municipality. In 1881 North Suburban Municipality was divided into two parts, 1) Cossipore- Chitpur Municipality (later amalgamated with Kolkata Municipal area) and 2) Baranagar Municipality. On 1 August 1899, Kamarhati Municipality was formed, parting Kamarhati and Ariadaha Mouzas from Baranagar. In 1949 Dakshineswar Mouza was parted from Baranagar and merged with Kamarhati Municipality.<ref name="Baranagar Demographics">{{cite web |url=http://oaji.net/articles/2016/491-1465043063.pdf |title=''DEMOGRAPHICAL VIEW OF BARANAGAR MUNICIPALITY FROM 1991-2001'' |last1=Guha |first1=Subhanil |last2=Dey |first2=Anindita |date=4 April 2016 |access-date=19 November 2019 |publisher=oaji.net}}</ref>

Baranagar was one or majorly affected cities during the [[Naxalbari uprising|Naxalbari Uprising]]. In the early 1970s, a massacre took place in the city as the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] led Indian state retaliated against the political movement. The joint operation of the police and criminals attacked alleged Naxalites as well as their family members. The family of a congressman wasn't spared either [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/documentary-reopens-old-wounds/articleshow/39199408.cms] Grotesque killings took place as more than 100-1000 people were torched, gunned down or hacked to death. The police never bothered to give any official number. There has been call for an judicial enquiry but none took place even after 50 years have passed.[https://bengali.hindusthansamachar.in/Encyc/2021/8/13/50-years-of-Kashipur-Baranagar-genocide.php][https://nagorik.net/opinion/kashipur-baranagar-genocide/] The culprits were never brought to books. There are allegations by political activists that those policemen who were involved in the killings were later promoted to higher ranks.

In Kuthighat (Baranagar), there was an old house/lodge of Dutch merchants.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://siddharthabiswas.com/tag/baranagar/ |title=Baranagar - Peregrine's Progress |last=Biswas |first=Siddhartha |date=21 March 2020 |access-date=26 March 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.outlookindia.com/outlooktraveller/explore/story/70718/have-you-been-to-the-dutch-colony-in-baranagar |title=A heritage walk in this little-known gem made me aware of its links to Subhas Chandra Bose |last=Deb |first=Soham |date=28 July 2020 |access-date=26 March 2022}}</ref>
