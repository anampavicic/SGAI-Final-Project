{{nihongo|'''Shizuoka'''|静岡市|Shizuoka-shi|extra={{IPAc-ja|si|zu|'|o|ka}}}} is the capital city of [[Shizuoka Prefecture]], [[Japan]], and the prefecture's second-largest city in both population and area. It has been populated since prehistoric times. {{As of|2023|09|01|post=,}} the city had an estimated [[population]] of 677,867 in 106,087 households,<ref name="Shizuoka City">{{cite web | url=http://www.city.shizuoka.jp/000_001588_00001.html | title=Tsukibetsu jinkō dēta（Shizuoka shi no jinkō setaisū | script-title=ja:月別人口データ（静岡市の人口・世帯数 | trans-title=Monthly population data (population and number of households in Shizuoka City) | date=2020-10-10 | language=ja | website=City of Shizuoka | agency=Shizuoka City Planning Bureau, Planning Division, Statistics Section | access-date=2020-10-30 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201030040324/https://www.city.shizuoka.lg.jp/000_001588_00001.html | archive-date=2020-10-30 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all}}</ref> and a [[population density]] of {{convert|480|PD/km2}}.

==Overview==
The city's name is made up of two ''[[kanji]]'', {{lang|ja|静}} ''shizu'', meaning "still" or "calm"; and {{lang|ja|岡}} ''oka'', meaning "hill(s)".<ref name="PlacenamesOfTheWorld" /> In 1869, Shizuoka Domain was first created out of the older [[Sunpu Domain]], and that name was retained when the city was incorporated in 1885. In 2003, Shizuoka absorbed neighboring Shimizu City (now [[Shimizu-ku, Shizuoka|Shimizu Ward]]) to create the new and expanded city of Shizuoka, briefly becoming the largest city by land area in Japan. In 2005, it became one of Japan's "[[Cities designated by government ordinance of Japan|designated cities]]".

==Geography==
Shizuoka City lies in central [[Shizuoka Prefecture]], about halfway between [[Tokyo]] and [[Nagoya]] along the [[Taiheiyō Belt|Tōkaidō Corridor]], between [[Suruga Bay]] to the south and the [[Akaishi Mountains|Minami Alps]] in the north. Shizuoka had the largest area of any municipality in Japan after merging with Shimizu City in April 2003, until February 2005, when [[Takayama, Gifu|Takayama]] in [[Gifu Prefecture]] superseded it by merging with nine surrounding municipalities.

The total area of the city is {{convert|1411.90|km2|sqmi|2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=2015stats>{{Cite web |url=http://www.city.shizuoka.jp/000163754.pdf |title=Shizuoka statistics |access-date=5 January 2016 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304131531/http://www.city.shizuoka.jp/000163754.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> Shizuoka is the 5th largest city in Japan in terms of geographic area after Takayama, [[Hamamatsu]], [[Nikkō, Tochigi|Nikkō]], and [[Kitami, Hokkaido|Kitami]]. It is also the 2nd largest city in Shizuoka Prefecture in terms of both geographic area and population after [[Hamamatsu]], but ranks higher as an [[Urban Employment Area]],<ref name="2015_UEA_Data">{{Cite web | first1=Yoshitsugu | last1=Kanemoto | title=Urban Employment Area Population Data, Metropolitan Employment Area (MEA) (2015 Standards) | url=http://www.csis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/UEA/MEA2015P.csv | website=Center for Spatial Information Science | language=ja,en |publisher=[[University of Tokyo]] | format=CSV | access-date=2010-10-30 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322072115/http://www.csis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/UEA/MEA2015P.csv | archive-date=2019-03-22 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all}}</ref> and leads as a [[metropolitan area]] and business region.

The fan-like shape of the Shizuoka Plain and Miho Peninsula were formed over the ages by the fast-flowing [[Abe River]], carrying along collapsed sand and earth. These areas form the foundations of the city today.<ref name="APWS242" />{{rp|page=242}} The isolated [[Mount Kunō]] separates the Suruga coastline from the Shimizu coastline.

===Climate===
On the south-central Pacific coast Shizuoka has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''), which is hot and humid in the summer, and rarely snows in the winter.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/view/monthly_s3_en.php?block_no=47656&view=14 | title=Monthly total of snowfall depth (cm) | date=2020 | website=[[Japan Meteorological Agency]] | access-date=2020-10-30 | df=dmy-all | archive-date=4 March 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304055814/http://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/view/monthly_s3_en.php?block_no=47656&view=14 | url-status=live }}</ref> It is close to the warm [[Kuroshio Current]] and is wet even by Japanese standards with only slightly less precipitation than [[Kanazawa]] on the opposite side of Honshū, but it is paradoxically the sunniest of Japan's major cities owing to the absence of summer fog and its sheltered location from the northwesterly winds off the [[Sea of Japan]]. Further north, the mountainous [[Ikawa, Shizuoka|Ikawa]] area is part of the Japanese [[Snow country (Japan)|snow country]], where there are ski areas.

[[File:Sunpu castle tatsumiyagura.jpg|thumb|200px|Reconstructed Tatsumi [[Yagura (tower)|yagura]] of [[Sunpu Castle]] ]]

===Ancient history===
The area that is now the city of Shizuoka has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Numerous [[kofun]] have been found within the city limits, and the [[Toro (archaeological site)|Toro]] [[archaeological site]] indicates that a major [[Yayoi period]] (circa 400 BC–300 AD) settlement existed in what is now part of the central city area.

[[Suruga province|Suruga]] was established as a province of Japan in the early [[Nara period]]. At some point between the year 701 and 710, the provincial capital was relocated from what is now [[Numazu, Shizuoka|Numazu]], to a more central location on the banks of the [[Abe River]] at a location named {{nihongo|Sunpu|駿府}} (a contraction of {{nihongo|"Suruga no Kokufu"|駿河の国府}}) or alternatively {{nihongo|"Fuchū"|府中}}.

=== Pre-modern Shizuoka ===
During the [[Muromachi period]], Sunpu was the capital of the [[Imagawa clan]]. The Imagawa were defeated at the [[Battle of Okehazama]], and Sunpu was subsequently ruled by [[Takeda Shingen]], followed by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]. However, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] relocated Ieyasu, and installed Nakamura Kazutada to rule Sunpu. After the Toyotomi were defeated in the [[Battle of Sekigahara]], Ieyasu recovered Sunpu, reassigning it to his own retainer, [[Naitō Nobunari]] in 1601. This marked the start of [[Sunpu Domain]].

In April 1606, Ieyasu officially retired from the post of ''[[shōgun]]'', and retired to Sunpu, where he established a secondary court, from which he could influence ''Shōgun'' [[Tokugawa Hidetada]] from behind the scenes. Subsequently, aside for brief periods, Sunpu was ''[[Tokugawa shogunate|tenryō]]'' (territory under direct administration by the Shogunate), ruled by the {{nihongo|''[[Sunpu jōdai]]''|駿府城代}}, an appointed official based in Sunpu.

===From the Meiji period to World War II===
In 1869, after the fall of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], the former shogunal line, headed by [[Tokugawa Iesato]] was sent to Sunpu and assigned the short-lived [[Sunpu Domain]]. The same year, Sunpu was renamed "Shizuoka". Shizuoka Domain became [[Shizuoka Prefecture]] with the [[abolition of the han system]] in 1871, which was expanded in 1876 through merger with the former Hamamatsu Prefecture and western portions of [[Ashigaru Prefecture]] in 1876. [[Shizuoka Station]] on the [[Tōkaidō Main Line]] was opened on 1 February 1889. The same day, a fire burned down most of downtown Shizuoka.

The modern city was founded on 1 April 1889. At the time, the population was 37,681, and Shizuoka was one of the first 31 cities established in Japan.

An electric [[tram]] service began in 1911. In 1914, due to heavy rains caused by a [[typhoon]], the [[Abe River]] flooded, inundating the downtown area.<ref>{{cite journal | trans-title=The landslide dam and outburst floods at Warabino area of the Abe River in 1914 | script-title=ja:安倍川中流・蕨野地区の西側山腹崩壊で生じた河道閉塞と１９１４年の水害 | last1=Inoue | first1=Kimio | first2=Junichi | last2=Kanbara | first3=Kazushi | last3= Motohashi | first4=Yasuhiro | last4=Watanabe | journal=Journal of the Japan Society of Erosion Control Engineering | volume=61 | issue=2 | pages=30{{hyphen}}35 | date=2008-07-15 | language=ja,en | publisher=[[Japan Society of Civil Engineers|Japan Society of Erosion Control Engineering]] | doi=10.11475/sabo.61.2_30 | df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the national census of 1920, the population of Shizuoka was 74,093. The area of the city continued to expand through the 1920s and 1930s through merger with outlying towns and villages. In 1935, the city was struck by a 6.4 magnitude [[earthquake]], resulting in much damage. Although soon rebuilt, a large fire in 1940 again destroyed much of the center of the city.

During [[World War II]], Shizuoka lacked targets of major military significance, and was initially only lightly bombed during several [[Japan campaign|American air raids]]. However, in a major [[firebombing]] [[Bombing of Shizuoka in World War II|raid of 19 June 1945]], the city suffered an extreme amount of damage with high civilian casualties.

===Post-war Shizuoka===
The area of the city continued to expand through the 1950s and 1960s through merger with outlying towns and villages. On 1 October 1964, the [[Tōkaidō Shinkansen]] began services to Shizuoka, and on 25 April 1969 the city was connected to the [[Tōmei Expressway]]. On 7 July 1974, the Abe River flooded, and landslides occurred during heavy rains, killing 23 people.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}
On 16 August 1980, a major gas leak in an underground shopping center near Shizuoka Station resulted in an explosion, killing 15 people and seriously injuring 233 others. The Shizuoka City Hall moved to new premises in 1986. On 1 April 1992, Shizuoka was designated a [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] by the central government, giving it increased autonomy.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130629153438/http://www.soumu.go.jp/main_content/000215647.pdf List of Core Cities, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications</ref>

The 1 April 2003 [[Municipal mergers and dissolutions in Japan|merger]] with Shimizu City (current [[Shimizu-ku, Shizuoka|Shimizu Ward]]) greatly expanded the area and population of Shizuoka,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.city.shizuoka.jp.e.qv.hp.transer.com/556_000097.html |title=Shizuoka city home page, Shimizu merger documents |access-date=5 January 2016 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072542/http://www.city.shizuoka.jp.e.qv.hp.transer.com/556_000097.html |url-status=live }}</ref> which then became a [[Cities designated by government ordinance of Japan|designated city]] on 1 April 2005,<ref name="DecodingBoundaries148" /> and was divided into three wards. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Despite being somewhat geographically isolated from the rest of the city, the town of [[Kanbara, Shizuoka|Kanbara]] (from [[Ihara District, Shizuoka|Ihara District]]) was merged into Shizuoka on 31 March 2006,<ref>[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20060411f1.html City mergers seen tailing off as the initial excitement fades | The Japan Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> becoming part of Shimizu-ku. On 1 November 2008, the town of [[Yui, Shizuoka|Yui]] (also from [[Ihara District, Shizuoka|Ihara District]]) was also merged into Shimizu-ku, resulting in the dissolution of Ihara District.<ref>http://www.city.shizuoka.jp.e.qv.hp.transer.com/000_001670.html Shizuoka city home page, Yui merger documents</ref>

Shizuoka has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 48 members. The city contributes 13 members to the Shizuoka Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between [[Shizuoka 1st district]] and Shizuoka 4th district in the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|lower house]] of the [[Japanese Diet]].

''Abekawa Mochi'' is a type of rice cake (or ''[[mochi]]'') made with ''[[kinako]]'' soy flour that is a specialty of Shizuoka.

Shizuoka has a long history of being involved in the craft industries going back over 400 years ago, using trees, including {{lang|ja|[[Chamaecyparis obtusa|hinoki]]}} cypress. The model industry goes back to the late 1920s when wood was used to produce model toys, using [[sashimono]] woodworking joinery techniques, purely for educational purposes. Craftsmen later moved on to lighter woods including [[Ochroma pyramidale|balsa]], but following the war, with the importation of US built scale models, many companies either turned to plastic models to compete or went under.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/product-description/4770028512 |title=Amazon.co.uk: Master Modeler: Creating the Tamiya Style: Shunsaku Tamiya, Giles Murray: Books<!-- Bot generated title --> |website=Amazon UK |access-date=11 September 2017 |archive-date=4 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240904052004/https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/4770028512?ie=UTF8&*entries*=0&viewID=&*Version*=1 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=T7RXfpXNORMC&dq=master+modeler+creating+the+tamiya+style&pg=PA21 田宮模型の仕事: Creating the Tamiya Style By Shunsaku Tamiya]</ref>

===Seaways===
====Sea port====
The Port of Shimizu-ku, in Shimizu City (now [[Shimizu Ward]]), is a long established mid-size sea port, catering to container ships, dry bulk ships and cruise ships.<ref name="PortOfShimizu">{{cite web | url=https://www.portofshimizu-intl.com/ | title=Port of Shimizu | website=Shimizu Port Authority | access-date=2020-10-30 | language=en | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201024050004/https://www.portofshimizu-intl.com/ | archive-date=2020-10-24 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all}}</ref>

It is well located, being in between the two major port areas of Japan, i.e. the [[Tokyo Bay]] ports of Tokyo, Kawasaki and Yokohama ([[Keihin region|Keihin]] ports) and the [[Osaka Bay]] ports of Osaka and Kobe ([[Hanshin Industrial Region|Hanshin]] ports). The Port of Shimizu has a water depth of about {{convert|12|m|ft}}; its attractiveness has been enhanced over the past years by the construction of new road and rail links which contribute to expanding its commercial hinterland.

In tonnage, imports (about {{convert|6.5|e6t}}) are close to twice export volumes, but in trade value exports are twice as valuable as imports.

The Port of Shimizu container traffic is about balanced, with over 250,000 [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEU]] in each direction, with auto parts and chemicals amongst the main cargo types. Major international container lines provide weekly services on major trade routes, including North America, Europe and Asia, with about 110 calls per months on 28 trade routes.

The port of Shimizu also includes a terminal to receive [[LNG]] tankers and store imported Liquefied natural gas; it is operated by Shimizu LNG, a subsidiary of Shizuoka Gas (Japan is the world's largest importer of [[LNG]]).

The Port of Shimizu is also connected to other Japan ports. In particular, it is served by a Roll-on/roll-off service serving the port of [[Ōita Prefecture|Ōita]], on the north-east coast of the southern island of [[Kyushu]]. This service, which sails three times a week and has a transit time of 20 hours, has enabled a modal shift of freight trucks from road to sea, thereby contributing to decreasing congestion and pollution on roads.

===Shizuoka Performing Arts Center ===
<!---redirects target this section--->
The Shizuoka Performing Arts Center (SPAC) was founded in 1995 by the Shizuoka Prefecture.<ref name=aboutspac>{{cite web | title=What's SPAC | website=SPAC | date=5 March 2019 | url=https://spac.or.jp/en/about | access-date=14 December 2021}}</ref> The building was designed by architect [[Arata Isozaki]]<ref name=miyagi>{{cite interview | title=Artist Interview: Satoshi Miyagi (Artistic Director of Shizuoka Performing Arts Center)|first=Satoshi| last=Miyagi| interviewer-first= Hiroko | interviewer-last=Yamaguchi  | website=Performing Arts Network Japan | date=29 October 2012 | url=https://performingarts.jp/E/art_interview/1907/1.html | access-date=14 December 2021}}</ref> and was opened in 1999 for the second [[Theatre Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web | title=A Triumphant 'Olympics' in Japan | website=[[The New York Times]]|first=Gilles |last=Kennedy | date=16 June 1999 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/16/style/IHT-a-triumphant-olympics-in-japan.html | access-date=14 December 2021}}</ref>

The [[arts center]] is the first publicly funded cultural organization in Japan to have its own [[acting troupe|troupe of actors]] and other staff to manage its own venues and facilities for artistic purposes. Suzuki Tadashi was the first [[Artistic Director]], appointed in 1997 and staying in the position until March 2007, after which Miyagi Satoshi took up the appointment.<ref name=aboutspac/> SPAC has organised the World Theatre Festival Shizuoka each year since 2011,<ref name=aboutfest>{{cite web | title=World Theatre Festival Shizuoka | website=SPAC | date=19 March 2019 | url=https://spac.or.jp/en/project/festival | language=la | access-date=14 December 2021}}</ref> as well as creating its own theatre productions (some of which tour abroad), having students to learn at the center, and other theatrical activities.<ref name=aboutspac/>

The World Theatre Festival Shizuoka was formerly called the Shizuoka Spring Festival (2000-2010<ref name=aboutfest/>), being changed to "World Theater Festival Shizuoka under Mt. Fuji" in 2012 by the artistic director of the centre, Miyagi Satoshi. His intention was "to connect Shizuoka to the world through theater", to have performances from every corner of the world, for "people to see that the world isn't a set and finished quantity and there is still plenty of room for change. I wanted to communicate that theater is a window to the world".<ref name=miyagi/> The festival includes stage plays, puppetry, film, dance and other performance arts.<ref name=aboutfest/>

In 2020, due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], it was announced on 3 April that the festival, scheduled to begin from 25 April to 6 May, would be cancelled. Instead, Miyagi staged an online version of the festival.<ref>{{cite web | last=Tanaka | first=Nobuko | title=World Theatre Festival Shizuoka heads online in desperate times | website=[[The Japan Times]] | date=5 June 2020 | url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2020/06/05/stage/world-theatre-festival-shizuoka-online/ | access-date=14 December 2021}}</ref>

===Sport===
With the Shimizu merger, [[Shimizu S-Pulse]] became the major [[football (soccer)|football]] club in the city. Recently, however, a new rival club, [[Fujieda MYFC]] (from nearby [[Fujieda, Shizuoka|Fujieda]]), has been rising in the regional league ranks as a contender for a place in the [[Japan Football League]].
The city hosted the official [[Asian Basketball Championship for Women]] in [[1995 Asian Basketball Championship for Women|1995]] and [[1999 Asian Basketball Championship for Women|1999]].
