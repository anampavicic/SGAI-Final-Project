[[Image:La Laguna BW 5.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|Plaza del Adelantado. La Laguna]]
'''San Cristóbal de La Laguna''' (commonly known as '''La Laguna''', {{IPA|es|saŋ kɾisˈtoβal de la laˈɣuna}}) is a city and municipality in the northern part of the island of [[Tenerife]] in the [[Province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]], on the [[Canary Islands]], [[Spain]]. The former capital of the Canary Islands, the city is the third-most populous city of the archipelago and the second-most populous city of the island. 

In 1999 the historical center of La Laguna was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]], after being nominated by Spain. La Laguna is situated alongside the city of [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]]; thus, the two cities and municipalities form a single large urban center. Its economy is business-oriented while agriculture dominates the northeastern portion of the city. The urban area dominates the central and the southern parts.

La Laguna is considered to be the cultural capital of the Canary Islands. It holds the [[Incorruptibility|incorrupt]] body of [[Mary of Jesus de León y Delgado|Sor María de Jesús]], and the Christ of La Laguna ([[Cristo de La Laguna]]). 

A landmark of the city is the [[Cathedral of La Laguna]], which is the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] cathedral of Tenerife and its diocese ([[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Cristóbal de La Laguna|Diocese of Tenerife]]). Important historical figures of the city include [[Amaro Rodríguez Felipe|Amaro Pargo]], one of the famous corsairs of the [[Golden Age of Piracy]], and [[José de Anchieta]], Catholic saint, missionary, and founder of the cities of [[São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]] in [[Brazil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://revistadehistoria.es/jose-de-anchieta-el-espanol-que-fundo-sao-paulo-y-rio-de-janeiro/| title=José de Anchieta, el español que fundó Sao Paulo y Río de Janeiro |work=Revista de Historia |date=29 March 2021 |access-date=16 September 2024}}</ref> The 16th- century young woman, [[Catalina Lercaro]], was said to have committed suicide rather than accept an arranged marriage she opposed. Her spectre or ghost is said to haunt her former family mansion, now used as a museum of history of Tenerife. 

==Etymology==
[[Alonso Fernández de Lugo]] named the city as ''"Villa de San Cristóbal de La Gran Laguna"'' upon its founding, believed to be related to a nearby pond or lake (''laguna''). The name was later shortened to "San Cristóbal de La Laguna".

==Coat of arms==
Queen [[Joanna of Castile]] granted the coat of arms on 23 March 1510, designated for the island of [[Tenerife]]. Officials of the town of La Laguna, designated as the capital after the conquest, adopted this emblem as their own. 

It features an island with a volcano spitting fire, on waves, between a castle and a lion. Above is the archangel [[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael]], holding a spear in one hand and a shield in the other. In the border, the inscription ''Michael Arcangele Veni in Adjutorium Populo Dei Thenerife Me Fecit''. These elements symbolize the incorporation of the island of Tenerife to the [[Crown of Castile]] and its [[evangelization]] under the patronage of Saint Michael.

==Climate==
Because it captures moisture from the prevailing northeasterly winds, San Cristóbal de La Laguna has a [[Mediterranean climate#Warm-summer mediterranean climate|Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csb'') that contrasts with the [[arid climate]] of other cities on the Canary Islands. It receives three to five times more rainfall than falls on the southern slopes, around ten percent less sunshine, and about ten percent higher humidity throughout the year. In spite of its elevation, the maritime and subtropical influences keep the temperature above frost at all times.

==History==
[[Image:Urville-Laguna.jpg|thumb|San Cristóbal de La Laguna in 1880]]
[[File:Escultura Padre Anchieta 05.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[José de Anchieta|Saint José de Anchieta]], saint and evangelizing missionary of Brazil.]]
The land upon which the city now stands belonged to the [[Menceyato de Anaga]], which was one of nine aboriginal [[Guanches|Guanche]] kingdoms on the island until its conquest by the [[Kingdom of Castile]]. The valley of Aguere (where the city lies) and especially the large lake that was in this place, was a place of pilgrimage for the aborigines of the island.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.elmundo.es/motor/2000/MV137/MV137laguna.html |title=La Laguna. La ciudad de los sentidos |last=Martín |first=Sabas |date=22 January 2000 |access-date=10 July 2018 |newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |language=es |archive-date=26 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126065352/http://www.elmundo.es/motor/2000/MV137/MV137laguna.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Battle of Aguere]] was fought in the city in 1494. The city was founded between 1496 and 1497 by [[Alonso Fernández de Lugo]] and became the capital of the island of Tenerife after the conclusion of the conquest of the islands. Later the city became the capital of all of the Canary Islands. In 1582, the city suffered an [[Black Death|epidemic of plague]] that resulted in between 5,000 and 9,000 deaths.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.museosdetenerife.org/assets/downloads/publication-f11acf7d04.pdf |title=La Peste.

The layout of the city resembles that of many Spanish colonial cities in the Americas. Since the urban plan of the city of La Laguna was the model for these [[Latin American]] cities.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.elnuevoherald.com/2012/06/02/1216983/la-laguna-ciudad-colonial-en-tenerife.html |title=La Laguna: ciudad colonial en Tenerife |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130409050959/http://www.elnuevoherald.com/2012/06/02/1216983/la-laguna-ciudad-colonial-en-tenerife.html |archive-date=9 April 2013 |newspaper=[[El Nuevo Herald]] |last=Rupérez |first=Beatriz |language=es |pages=1–2 |access-date=10 July 2018}}</ref> The [[University of La Laguna]] was founded in 1701.

A declining population and economy in the 18th century resulted in the transfer of the capital to [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] in 1723. Santa Cruz has since been the capital of the island of Tenerife and the sole capital of the Canary Islands until 1927, since which time the capital of the Canary Islands has been shared with the city of [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]].

The [[Tenerife North Airport]] at Los Rodeos was opened in the 1930s and is today expanding.

[[File:La Laguna 2022 - main facade.jpg|thumb|left|Cathedral of Our Lady of the Remedies, seat of the local Catholic diocese]]
The historic center of the city was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] on 2 December 1999. Several streets of historical significance have been closed off to automobile traffic. La Laguna has often been called the «[[Florence]] of the Canary Islands», due to its many churches and convents, as well as its old town and historic buildings.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/cultura/actividades/hacultartcan/hacultartcan2/hacultartcan6.pdf |title=Arquitectura para la ciudad burguesa: Canarias, siglo XIX |last=Hernández Gutiérrez |first=A.

Several tunnels, passages and underground vaults dating from the immediate aftermath of the founding of the city have recently been found. These tunnels are located beneath some iconic buildings such as the [[Iglesia de la Concepción (San Cristóbal de La Laguna)|Iglesia de la Concepción]], the [[Cathedral of La Laguna|Cathedral of our Lady of the Remedies]] and the former Convent of San Agustín.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.es/20090626/canarias-canarias/pasadizos-bajo-laguna-20090626.html |title=Pasadizos bajo La Laguna |author=R.C. |date=26 June 2009 |access-date=10 July 2018 |newspaper=[[ABC (Spain)|ABC]] |language=es |archive-date=11 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711024513/https://www.abc.es/20090626/canarias-canarias/pasadizos-bajo-laguna-20090626.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Researchers believe that the present city of La Laguna has been raised, because now it does not have the same ground level as at the time of its founding. In some places it is more than one meter higher and buries what is underneath.
