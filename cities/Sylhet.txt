== Geography and climate ==
Sylhet is located in the northeastern region of Bangladesh within the Sylhet Division, the Sylhet District, and Sylhet Sadar Upazila. Sylhet has a typical Bangladeshi [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Am'') bordering on a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cwa'') at higher elevations. The rainy season runs from April to October, and is generally hot and humid with heavy showers and thunderstorms almost every day. The shorter dry season runs from November to February, with very warm and fairly clear weather. Nearly 80% of the annual average rainfall of {{convert|4200|mm|in|-1}} occurs between May and September.<ref>[http://weather.msn.com/monthly_averages.aspx?wealocations=wc:BGXX0010&q=Sylhet%2c+BGD+forecast:averagesm Monthly Averages for Sylhet, BGD] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701141245/https://www.msn.com/en-us/weather/ |date=1 July 2019 }} MSN Weather. Retrieved 25 May 2009.</ref>

The city is located within a topographically distinctive region of Bangladesh characterized by dramatic hills and basins. The [[physiography]] of Sylhet consists mainly of hill soils and encompasses a few large depressions known locally as "[[beel]]s," which are frequently [[oxbow lake]]s caused by tectonic subsidence during [[1762 Arakan earthquake|the earthquake of 1762]].

Geologically, the region is complex and diverse; higher-elevation regions date partly to the Plio-[[Miocene]] age. Available limestone deposits in different parts of the region suggest that the whole area was under the ocean in the Oligo-Miocene. In the last 150 years, three major earthquakes have hit the city with magnitude of at least 7.5 on the [[Richter Scale]], most recently in 1918.<ref name="ds10Feb2006">{{cite news |last=Siddiquee |first=Iqbal |date=10 February 2006 |title=Sylhet growing as a modern urban centre |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/suppliments/2006/15thanniv/ourcities/ourcities24.htm |work=Our Cities: 15th Anniversary Special |publisher=The Daily Star |access-date=25 May 2009 |archive-date=21 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721161221/http://archive.thedailystar.net/suppliments/2006/15thanniv/ourcities/ourcities24.htm |url-status=dead}}</ref>

As of 2009, Sylhet has friendly relations with:
* {{flagicon|UK}} [[St Albans City and District|St Albans]], United Kingdom<ref name=stalbans>{{cite web |title=Councillors, mayoralty and town twinning |url=https://www.stalbans.gov.uk/councillors-mayoralty-and-town-twinning |website=stalbans.gov.uk |publisher=St Albans City & District Council |access-date=2021-08-18}}</ref>
* {{flagicon|UK}} [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale|Rochdale]], United Kingdom<ref>{{cite web |url=http://democracy.rochdale.gov.uk/CeListDocuments.aspx?CommitteeId=118&MeetingId=666&DF=08%2F07%2F2009&Ver=2.pdf |title=Rochdale Township Committee |publisher=[[Rochdale Borough Council]] |date=4 July 2019}}</ref>

The friendship link with St Albans was established in 1988, when the St Albans' [[Districts of England|district council]] supported a housing project in Sylhet as part of the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless. Sylhet was chosen because it is the home region for a large ethnic minority population in St Albans.<ref name=stalbans/>

In March 2009 the Mayor of Sylhet, Badar Uddin Ahmed Kamran, signed a Memorandum of Understanding to form another friendship link between Sylhet and Rochdale, home to around 10,000 people with Sylheti heritage. The Mayor of Sylhet signed it alongside the Mayor of Rochdale, Cllr Keith Swift, at the [[Sylhet City Corporation]].{{cn|date=August 2021}}
