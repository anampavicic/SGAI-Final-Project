'''Luhansk''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|l|uː|ˈ|h|æ|n|s|k}}, {{IPAc-en|us|-|ˈ|h|ɑː|n|-}}; {{langx|uk|Луганськ}}, {{IPA|uk|lʊˈɦɑnʲsʲk|IPA|uk-Луганськ.ogg}}), also known as '''Lugansk''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|-|ˈ|ɡ|æ|n|-}}, {{IPAc-en|us|-|ˈ|ɡ|ɑː|n|-}}; {{langx|ru|Луганск}}, {{IPA|ru|lʊˈɡansk|IPA}}), is a city in the [[Donbas]] region, eastern [[Ukraine]]. As of 2022, the population was estimated to be {{Ua-pop-est2022|397,677|,}} making Luhansk the [[Cities in Ukraine|12th-largest city in Ukraine]].

Luhansk served as the administrative center of [[Luhansk Oblast]], before pro-Russian separatists seized control of the city in 2014 and made it the capital of the self-proclaimed [[Luhansk People's Republic]]. The Ukrainian administration was located in [[Sievierodonetsk]] from 2014 to 2022 during the [[War in Donbas (2014–2022)|war in Donbas]], due to Ukraine not being in control of Luhansk. Sievierodonetsk was [[Battle of Sievierodonetsk (2022)|captured]] by Russia in 2022 and the Luhansk Oblast was later [[Russian annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts|annexed by Russia]] in late 2022.

==History==
===Founding and early history===
{{stack|[[File:Gaskoin Karl. Lugansk.jpg|thumb|The bust of [[Charles Gascoigne]] in Luhansk]]}}
The city traces its history to 1797 when the British industrialist [[Charles Gascoigne]], commissioned by the [[Imperial Russian]] government in 1795, founded an ammunition and cannon factory for the [[Black Sea Fleet]].<ref name=IEU/> Gascoigne had emigrated to [[Saint Petersburg]] years earlier, and founded factories and mines across the Russian Empire during his time there. There is a prominent bust of him in Luhansk commemorating his role in the city's founding.<ref>{{cite news |date=2014-05-09|title=The surprising British origins of eastern Ukraine|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/05/09/the-surprising-british-origins-of-eastern-ukraine/ |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |access-date=2023-04-21}}</ref>

The factory was built in the [[Donets Basin]] (or Donbas) the confluence of the [[Luhan (river)|Luhan]] and {{ill|Vilkhivka (river)|lt=Vilkhivka|uk|Вільхівка (річка)}} rivers. The Russian craftsmen settled upstream, at the settlement of Kamianyi Brid.<ref name=IEU>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CL%5CU%5CLuhansk.htm|encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine|title=Luhansk|access-date=16 September 2023}}</ref> The name "Luhansk" comes from the [[Luhan (river)|Luhan]] River, which flows through the city. According to [[folk etymology]], the name is also derived to the word "Luh" (Ukrainian: Луг), which means "meadow", referring to the floodplains around the river.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

The factory was greatly expanded during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and again during the [[Crimean War]]. By 1880, the factory was a large industrial node, linked by rail to other major cities and to the [[Azov Sea]]. In 1882, the Luhansk Factory was merged with Kamianyi Brid into a new settlement named Luhansk, which received city status. In 1897, Luhansk had a population of 20,400, 68.2% of whom were [[Russians]].<ref name=IEU/>

In summer 1896, German industrialist {{ill|Gustav Hartmann|de|Gustav Hartmann (Unternehmer)}} founded a [[locomotive]]-building company in Luhansk, which is now [[Luhanskteplovoz]]. It became operational in 1900, and soon produced a large proportion of all locomotives in the Russian Empire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ukrssr.com.ua/lugan/viniknennya-i-rozvitok-mista-lugansk|title=ВИНИКНЕННЯ І РОЗВИТОК МІСТА ЛУГАНСЬК|access-date=16 September 2023}}</ref>

===In the Soviet Union===

{{stack|[[File:Mk V tank in summer in Lugansk.jpg|thumb|One of the [[Mark V tank|Mk V]] tanks used by the [[Don Army]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]]]}}
Luhansk was economically devastated by the [[Russian Civil War]].<ref name=restoration/> In April 1918, Luhansk was occupied by the [[Central Powers]] during their [[1918 Central Powers invasion of Ukraine|invasion of Ukraine]]. Then, it was taken by [[Anton Denikin]]'s anti-communist [[Volunteer Army]] in May 1919, before changing hands several times. It was finally taken by the [[Red Army]] in January 1920.<ref name=IEU/>

After the end of the war, the victorious [[Bolsheviks]] created the [[Soviet Union]] on the territory of the former Russian Empire, and began restoring the city.<ref name=restoration>{{cite web|url=https://ukrssr.com.ua/lugan/vidnovlennya-luganska-pislya-gromadyanskoyi-viyni|title=Відновлення луганська після громадянської війни|access-date=16 September 2023}}</ref> The city grew rapidly during the [[interwar period]].<ref name=IEU/> On 5 November 1935, the city was renamed '''Voroshilovgrad''' ({{langx|ru|Ворошиловград|Voroshilovgrad}}; {{langx|uk|Ворошиловград|Voroshylovhrad}}) in honour of Soviet military commander and politician [[Kliment Voroshilov]].<ref name=ThirtyFive/> In 1938, [[Voroshilovgrad Oblast]] was established, with the city as its center.<ref name=IEU/>

The economic recovery and development of the city was also accompanied by significant demographic change. The population grew from 72,000 to 212,000 between 1926 and 1939, and there was an influx of [[Ukrainians]] from the countryside into the city. The proportion of Ukrainians grew from 19.1% to 58.7% between 1897 and 1939, many of whom were refugees fleeing the [[Holodomor]], a manmade famine across [[Soviet Ukraine]]. The Russian proportion of the population shrank to 34.5%.<ref name=IEU/>

Voroshilovgrad became a frontline city in [[World War II]] after the failure of [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Operation Barbarossa]] to capture major Soviet cities.<ref name=GPW>{{cite web|url=https://ukrssr.com.ua/lugan/lugansk-u-roki-velikoyi-vitchiznyanoyi-viyni|access-date=16 September 2023|title=ЛУГАНСЬК У РОКИ ВЕЛИКОЇ ВІТЧИЗНЯНОЇ ВІЙНИ}}</ref> In March 1942, a grand concert featuring the work of [[Taras Shevchenko]] was held in the city to inspire Ukrainians to fight off the invading Nazis.<ref name=IEU/> In July 1942, Germany concentrated its forces in the area and forced the Soviets to retreat to the Volga and the North Caucasus. On 14 July 1942, German troops captured Voroshilovgrad. Locals waged [[partisan warfare]] against the occupation. The city was eventually liberated by the [[Red Army]] on 14 February 1943.<ref name=GPW/>

In the postwar period, the city was rebuilt. The population recovered and grew, again alongside demographic change. More Russians were brought in to rebuild and help with [[industrialization]], again reducing the share of Ukrainians to a minority of 48.3% by 1959 and raising the share of Russians to 47.1%.<ref name=IEU/>
On 5 March 1958, after Khrushchev's call to not name cities after living people, the old name of Luhansk was reinstated.<ref name=ThirtyFive>{{cite web|url=http://shusek.livejournal.com/32065.html |title=Записки из Якирова Посада – Луганск-Ворошиловград-Луганск |publisher=Shusek.livejournal.com |date=2 November 2009 |access-date=16 September 2011}}</ref> Kliment Voroshilov himself opposed the restoration of the old name in 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://militera.lib.ru/bio/hruschev_sn/01.html|script-title=ru:'Военная Литература' – Биографии – С.Н. Хрущёв|trans-title='Military Literature' – Biographies – S. N. Khrushchev|language=ru|publisher=Militera.lib.ru|access-date=30 October 2017}}</ref> In January 1970, after the death of Kliment Voroshilov on 2 December 1969, the city's name was changed again to Voroshilovgrad.<ref name=ThirtyFive/>

Demographic shifts continued during the late Soviet period; by 1989, Ukrainians made up 41.8% of the population and Russians had a majority of 52.4%.<ref name=IEU/> On 4 May 1990, a decree of the [[Ukrainian parliament|Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR]] gave the city back its original name.<ref name=ThirtyFive/>

===Ukrainian independence===

Ukraine gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. In 1994, a consultative referendum took place in [[Donetsk Oblast]] and [[Luhansk Oblast]], with around 90% supporting the Russian language gaining status of an official language alongside [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], and for the Russian language to be an official language on a regional level.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Flynn |first1=M. K. |title=Political mobilization in eastern Ukraine: The referendum of 1994 in the Donetsk oblast |journal=The European Legacy |date=1996 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=342–349 |doi=10.1080/10848779608579417 | issn = 1084-8770 }}</ref>

The previous demographic trends reversed in independent Ukraine; by 2001, Ukrainians - who [[Russian language in Ukraine|increasingly spoke Russian]] - were 50% of the population and Russians made up 47%. The population as a whole began to decline as the economy stagnated, dropping from 505,000 in 1992 to 424,000 in 2014.<ref name=IEU/>
