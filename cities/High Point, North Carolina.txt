==History==
[[Image:EckerHouseHighPoint.jpg|right|thumb|Queen Anne Ecker House of 1908 in High Point]]

High Point was at the highest point of the 1856 [[North Carolina Railroad]] between [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] and [[Goldsboro, North Carolina|Goldsboro]], where it intersected the [[1852 Great Western Plank Road]]. Its central location and transportation allowed for the delivery of raw materials like cotton and lumber as well as import and export of processed goods, contributing to its early growth. High Point was settled by Europeans, including English [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and [[Germany|German]] immigrants, before 1750, but was not [[Municipal incorporation|incorporated]] until 1859. Before it became a major manufacturing center, the most important industries were tobacco, woodworking and textiles. The High Point furniture factory opened in 1889.<ref>[http://www.highpointchamber.org/hppc/hphistory.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928143322/http://www.highpointchamber.org/hppc/hphistory.html|date=September 28, 2007}}</ref> [[High Point University|High Point College]] was founded in 1924 as a private Methodist-affiliated institution.

==Geography==
{{maplink|frame=yes|zoom=10|id=Q631194|type=shape-inverse|text=Interactive map of High Point}}
High Point is the only city in North Carolina that exists within four counties: [[Davidson County, North Carolina|Davidson]], [[Forsyth County, North Carolina|Forsyth]], [[Guilford County, North Carolina|Guilford]] and [[Randolph County, North Carolina|Randolph]].<ref>{{cite web|title=County Maps|url=http://gisweb10.highpointnc.gov/JS/thePoint/|website=City of High Point, North Carolina|access-date=1 February 2017}}</ref> It also stands within two major watersheds: the [[Yadkin River|Yadkin]]–[[Pee Dee River|Pee Dee]] to the west and the [[Cape Fear River|Cape Fear]] to the east. Parts of the city rise above {{convert|1000|ft|m|-2}}, making it among the highest cities in North Carolina's [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]].

High Point is  bordered by [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] to the north, [[Jamestown, North Carolina|Jamestown]] to the northeast, and [[Archdale, North Carolina|Archdale]] to the southeast. The city limits of [[Trinity, North Carolina|Trinity]] and [[Thomasville, North Carolina|Thomasville]] come within half a mile of High Point's city limits to the south and southwest, respectively.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|58.43|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|56.91|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|1.52|sqmi}} (2.60%) is water.<ref name="TigerWebMapServer"/>

===Climate===
High Point experiences a [[humid subtropical climate]]. Summers are hot and humid, and the dew points will often climb to near or even above {{convert|70|F}} by late June through much of August. Nights usually remain warm above 70 degrees. Most summers the hottest day will record a maximum between {{convert|96|and|98|F}}. About once every 5 to 10 years the city will climb to or above {{convert|100|F}}. Winters are cool to cold. Nights average near {{convert|30|F}}, with the coldest averages in the upper 20s from late December through early February. Most winters the coldest temperature will dip to between {{convert|10|and|15|F}}. About once every 10 years the minimum will dip below {{convert|5|F}} and to near or below {{convert|0|F}} approximately once every 20 years. Daytime highs average near {{convert|50|F}} in the winter, with the coldest stretch between late December through early February with highs averaging in the upper 40s. Most winters there will be 2 to 4 days that remain below freezing. The hottest temperature on record for the area was {{convert|103|F}} on August 18, 1988 (in nearby Greensboro the high reached {{convert|104|F}} in 1914), and the coldest was {{convert|-8|F}} on January 21, 1985.

Rainfall patterns are generally spread evenly throughout the year, with between seven and eleven wet days per month. The city averages around {{convert|43|in}} of rain per year. Snowfall varies from year to year, with most years totaling less than {{convert|5|in|cm}}. However, there are some years that exceed {{convert|20|in|cm}}, and this brings the overall average to more than {{convert|8|in|cm}} per year. In the winter of 1959/60 the city had just over {{convert|30|in|cm}} of snowfall, which stands as the most dating back to the start of snowfall record-keeping in 1928. In addition to snowfall, some years the city can be impacted by significant ice storms. Cold air wedging up on the east side of the mountains can lock this part of the state into cold air while warmer moist air moves in aloft. This proximity to the mountains creates what is known as the Appalachian Wedge and can produce crippling ice storms.

High Point was one of several communities affected by a [[March 2010 Carolinas tornado outbreak|2010 tornado outbreak]]. The twister reached its most powerful EF3 classification as it crossed the northern suburbs of the city.

In 1989, High Point sustained minor wind damage from [[Hurricane Hugo]] as it raced through the western Piedmont region of North Carolina after making landfall 5 hours away in [[Charleston, South Carolina]].

==Economy==
===Diversification===
Though historically focused on production of furniture, hosiery, and [[Hatteras Yachts]], High Point diversified its economy by becoming a center for distribution and logistics, customer service, banking, manufacturing, photography and pharmaceuticals. The High Point Market remains important to High Point's economy and the city's furniture industry. Its bi-annual trade show is the largest furniture and furnishings industry event in the world. It is held in April and October of each year. Approximately {{convert|12000000|sqft|m2}} of showroom space is used by 2,300 exhibitors, in 188 separate buildings. Over 100 countries are represented through both vendors and visitors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highpointmarket.org/about/market-facts |title=High Point Market |publisher=High Point Market |access-date=2015-12-24}}</ref>

===Evolution of furniture industry===
High Point was an early center for the development of the furniture industry in the South.<ref name="Zach">Carolina Publications Inc., [http://www.northcarolinafurnitureguide.com/history.htm "North Carolina Furniture Guide: History of North Carolina Furniture"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113154655/http://www.northcarolinafurnitureguide.com/history.htm |date=2016-01-13 }}. Retrieved 3/6/2013</ref> Functional furniture had been produced on a small scale since the 17th century by artisans of English ancestry who had settled in North Carolina.<ref name="Jeff">[http://www.soc.duke.edu/NC_GlobalEconmy/furniture/overview.shtml "North Carolina in the Global Economy"], retrieved 3/6/2013</ref> As the farming landscape of the South began to change with the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and slavery, cheap labor became available during the [[Reconstruction Era]]. The North Carolina furniture industry gained momentum in the late 19th century, and developers were attracted to High Point for its location, transportation, and cheap labor. The city was in the center of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region with access to vast hardwood forests in the central and western parts of the state.<ref name="Zach" /> High Point, at the junction of the railroad and a main state road, provided a centralized shipping point for the southern market. An agricultural depression of the 1890s drove farm workers to developing towns like High Point looking for industrial jobs.<ref name="Alex">Patricia Phillips Marshall, [http://www.ncpedia.org/furniture/industrial-age "Furniture Industry – Part III: Furniture Production in the Industrial Age"] (2006).

Factories were needed to produce affordable wooden household furniture for the southern market. The first furniture company, the High Point Furniture Manufacturing Company, was formed in 1889. Subsequently, from 1890 to 1900, 38 new furniture factories opened in the state, with 13 of those in High Point.<ref name="Alex" /> The [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railway]] line was formed in 1894, and High Point was shipping eight fully loaded freight cars of furniture each day by 1898. By the turn of the century, High Point had become the leading furniture center in the South, with over 40 furniture companies in the city and the surrounding area.<ref name="Jake">Richard B. McCaslin, [http://www.ncpedia.org/high-point "High Point"] (2006). Retrieved 3/6/2013</ref> Meanwhile, other manufacturers set up local factories to provide related products like veneers, plate glass, mirrors, paint, and locks to furniture companies.

Profits in the North Carolina furniture industry declined with the increasing number of factories. In addition to the increased competition for market shares, by 1910 the salary for competent experienced workers and rising shipping costs had cut further into the profit. [[Bankruptcies]] resulted from inexperienced managers who tried to sell products below the cost of production and companies that tried to expand too quickly. An innovative High Point company, Tomlinson Chair Co., devised incentives to give its workforce an opportunity to receive part of the profits. The company was one of the first to manufacture period reproduction dining and living room furniture on a large scale. Employees who exceeded monthly quotas received a percentage bonus.<ref name="Alex" /> All workers received a [[life insurance]] policy as well.

Marketing became important to growth of the furniture industry in North Carolina in the twentieth century.<ref name="Paul">Patricia Phillips Marshall, [http://ncpedia.org/print/3822 "Furniture Industry-Part IV: Birth and Development of the Modern Furniture Industry"] (2006). Retrieved 3/22/2013</ref> Store owners had to visit the factory to select their orders due to the large size and weight of the furniture. This situation improved at the turn of the century with the mass marketing and sales of North Carolina furniture from the catalogues of [[Sears Roebuck and Co.]]<ref name="Alex" /> At the same time, competitors in large cities like [[New York City|New York]] and [[Chicago]] held a national exposition twice a year to display the manufacturers' products and to take orders from furniture dealers and buyers.<ref>[http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/furniture-making-in-america-hi-152371 "Furniture Making in America: History of High Point"], retrieved 3/6/2013</ref> Recognizing the need for a more convenient southern location, High Point furniture manufacturers began planning for an exposition to display and sell their product to the public. The first North Carolina furniture exposition was held in High Point in 1905.<ref name="Jeff" /> In 1921, a brand new Southern Furniture Exhibition Building was built with ten stories and {{convert|249000|sqft}} at a cost of $2 million. The event that became known as the [[High Point Furniture Market]] was attended by 700 buyers and generated $2.25 million in sales.<ref name="Alex" /> High Point overtook Chicago as the site of the nation's most important semi-annual furniture show.<ref name="Jeff" /> Gradually the High Point Furniture Market, held in April and October, grew into an internationally renowned furniture trade fair for home furnishings.<ref>[http://www.furniturelibrary.com/ Bienenstock Furniture Library], retrieved 3/22/2013.</ref> High Point continues to be the prime U.S. location to purchase brand-name furniture at a substantial discount.<ref name="Zach" />

The furniture industry and developing textile manufacturing set the pace for two 20th century growth booms in High Point.<ref name="Jeff" /> Over the decade of the 1920s, the population grew from 14,302 to 36,745 as $20 million of building permits were issued and $26 million was spent on city improvements. The [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] did not seem to affect the southern furniture market, which focused on trendy and affordable furniture, while those in the North focused on traditional, luxurious products. By 1935, North Carolina was second only to New York in US furniture production. Meanwhile, the High Point Market continued to set furniture trends and to be a national economic indicator; the $5 billion in sales in 1947 after [[World War II]] forecast a postwar boom.<ref name="Alex" /> The 1950s' growth of the furniture market mirrored that of High Point's second population boom from 39,973 in 1950 to 62,063 in 1960.<ref name="Jeff" /> By 1959, North Carolina had surpassed New York to become the state employing the most people in the furniture industry. In 1961, [[Our State|''The State'']] magazine declared, "High Point, in Guilford County, is the world's leading manufacturing center of wood furniture. It is also the location of one of the nation's principal furniture markets."<ref name="First in Nation">{{cite journal| last1=Houser| first1=John A.| title=First in Nation| journal=The State| date=July 7, 1961| volume=29| issue=3| page=13| url=http://digital.ncdcr.gov/cdm/ref/collection/p16062coll18/id/8538}}</ref> Four international furniture shows were being hosted by High Point at that time, including the [[High Point Market]] (still known then as the Southern Furniture Exposition), which ''The State'' reported was drawing crowds of five to six thousand buyers.<ref name="First in Nation"/> Throughout the end of the 20th century, North Carolina continued to lead the nation in the production of both upholstered and wooden household furniture. The furniture was slightly styled and inexpensive, but lost its regional characteristics. Some local artisans still maintained a unique and high quality wooden product. High Point became known as the "Furniture Capital of the World" in the 1980s during the golden era of North Carolina furniture manufacturing.<ref name="Paul" />

The [[globalization]] of the 1990s opened free trade and competition from foreign furniture manufacturers.<ref>North Carolina Digital History, [www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-recent/6256 "Key Industries: Furniture"], Retrieved 3/6/2013</ref> US companies, unable to compete, began outsourcing to [[Latin America]] and [[Asia]]. China became the leading manufacturer by producing furniture of equal quality at a lower price.<ref name="Paul" /> The majority of furniture companies in North Carolina have continued to close since the 1990s. The furniture makers who have maintained a high quality product made from solid wood continue to maintain a unique niche and are sold in both the United States and Asia.

==Education==
[[Image:High Point University.jpg|right|thumb|upright|High Point University, Roberts Hall]]
Private schools for children were established in and around High Point as early as the early nineteenth century by [[Quakers]]. The New York Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends, a network of Quakers from that state, started a school in [[Asheboro, North Carolina|Asheboro]] in the 1880s for [[African American]] students. The school relocated to High Point in 1891 on land east of town on Washington Street. The institution was named the High Point Normal and Industrial School (later William Penn High School), and was administered by the Quakers until 1897.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.greensboro.com/life/community_news/penn-griffin-remembers-legacy-of-former-segregated-william-penn-high/article_29467ea3-1d77-5afc-b5bd-e56e152c3ec1.html|title=Penn-Griffin remembers legacy of former segregated William Penn High School|publisher=News & Record|date=February 23, 2018|access-date=February 1, 2020}}</ref> In that year, black educator Alfred J.

The High Point public school system was founded in 1897 with the approval of a $10,000 bond, in part to finance the purchase of J. Elwood Cox's family home on South Main Street for use as the first school building. Twelve school commissioners were appointed to administer the 350-student system of five grades. Growth of the city's institutions reflected improved primary educational facilities. A school building campaign coupled with additional grades and improved classes resulted in four additional schools for white students: Elm Street School (1905), Park Street School (1910), Fairview School (1910), and Grimes Street School (1911). Many other schools were born in the 1920s during a period of rapid growth.

This building spree culminated in 1927 with the opening of High Point High School. Among the many high styled school complexes in the state, few surpass High Point's grand 1927 high school. The campus joined the talents of two designers, [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] architect Harry Barton and [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] landscape architect Earl S. Draper. The building was matched in 1931 with the addition of Ferndale Middle School just to the east, designed to incorporate details from the high school so that it maintained a campus theme. Both shared athletic facilities on a large tract of land between downtown and Emerywood. In 1962, High Point High School's name was modified to [[High Point Central High School]] when an additional high school, [[T. Wingate Andrews High School]], was established in the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gcsnc.com/domain/13151|title=History of Andrews High School|work=Guilford County Schools|access-date=February 1, 2020}}</ref>

Several private and independent schools are found in High Point, including [[High Point Christian Academy]] ([[Baptist]]), [[High Point Friends School]] ([[Quaker]]), [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]] ([[Catholic school|Catholic]]), [[Wesleyan Christian Academy]] ([[Wesleyan]]),  and [[Westchester Country Day School]] (nonsectarian), and [[Phoenix Academy (North Carolina)|Phoenix Academy]], a [[charter school]].

In 1921, the [[Chamber of Commerce]] made the establishment of a college in High Point a high priority and initiated a High Point College campaign. The campaign solicited funds in order to attract the attention of the North Carolina Methodist Protestants, who had desired for decades to found a college.

High Point succeeded in attracting the college over rivals Greensboro and [[Burlington, North Carolina|Burlington]] with a gift of {{convert|60|acre|ha}} and $100,000 in pledges from leading citizens. High Point College opened in 1924 (changed to [[High Point University]] in 1991) with three buildings at various stages of development. Many of the numerous civic organizations founded in the 1920s pledged funds, including the [[Rotary International|Rotary]], [[Kiwanis]], [[Civitan]], and the [[American Business Club]]. The architectural design of the High Point College campus was in keeping with traditional and historical architectural initiatives found at many private colleges and universities across the state in the 1920s. The administration building (Roberts Hall), male and female dormitories (McCulloch Hall and Women's Hall, respectively), and a central heating plant were all erected between 1922 and 1924 according to designs by [[Washington, D.C.]] architect R. E. Mitchell with assistance by High Point architect Herbert Hunter. Today, High Point University is a four-year, coeducational, liberal arts university related to the [[United Methodist Church]]. It offers 50 majors in a traditional day format. It also offers non-traditional evening programs, and the graduate studies program offers 10 master's degrees and one doctorate degree.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.highpoint.edu/visitorinformation/history-of-the-university/|title=History – High Point University|work=www.highpoint.edu|access-date=August 29, 2019}}</ref>
