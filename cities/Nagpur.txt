==Etymology==
[[File:Nag River reflecting urban pollution.jpg|thumb|left|Nag River]]
Nagpur is named after the Great [[Nag River|river Nag]] which flows through the city. The old Nagpur city (today called 'Mahal') is situated on north banks of the river Nag. ''Pur'' means "city" in many Indian languages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/most/p2vidal.htm |title=Management of Social Transformations (MOST) Programme – United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |access-date=25 November 2016}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Nagpur}}
{{see also|Nagpur state}}
One of the earlier names of Nagpur was "Fanindrapura". It derives its origin from the [[Marathi Language|Marathi]] word ''phaṇa'' ({{Translation|hood of a [[cobra]]}}). Nagpur's first newspaper was named ''Fanindramani'', which means a jewel that is believed to be suspended over a cobra's hood. It is this jewel that lights up the darkness, hence the name of the newspaper.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/Andhare-shines-a-light-on-Nagpurs-history/articleshow/46401555.cms |title=Andhare shines a light on Nagpur's history |work=The Times of India |date=28 February 2015 |access-date=27 July 2015}}</ref> [[B.

The Municipal Council for Nagpur was established in 1864. At that time, the area under the jurisdiction of the Nagpur Municipal Council was 15.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and the population was 82,000. The duties entrusted to the Nagpur Municipal Council were to maintain cleanliness and arrange for street lights and water supply with government assistance. The Municipal Corporation came into existence in March 1951. Nagpur is administered by the [[Nagpur Municipal Corporation]] (NMC), which is a democratically elected civic governing body. The Corporation elects a Mayor who along with a Deputy Mayor heads the organisation. The mayor carries out the activities through various committees such as the Standing Committee, health and sanitation committee, education committee, water works, public works, public health and market committee. Since January 2021, the mayor of Nagpur is Dayashankar Tiwari,<ref name="TOI23Nov2019">{{cite news |last1=Chakraborty |first1=Proshun |title=Dayashankar Tiwari elected 54th mayor of Nagpur |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/dayashankar-tiwari-elected-54th-mayor-of-nagpur/articleshow/80122378.cms |access-date=16 January 2021 |work=The Times of India |date=6 January 2021 |language=en}}</ref> The administrative head of the corporation is the Municipal Commissioner, an [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS) officer appointed by the state government.
