==Etymology==
From an inversion of the [[Ibanag language|Ibanag]] word ''nagali'' reversed to ''ilagan'' which means ''move'' or ''transfer'' in the [[Philippine English|English language]], due to the relocation of the site of the capital from Naguilian Baculod to its present site in barangay San Vicente. The move was due to the economy and security of the town. Another etymology, according to Fr. Julian Malumbres, Ilagan derived its name from the word ''laga'', an [[Ibanag language|Ibanag]] word for ''smallpox'' during the town's founding in 1686 when the disease was widespread.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History|url=https://cityofilagan.gov.ph/history/|access-date=September 2, 2021|website=Official Website {{!}} City of Ilagan {{!}} The Corn Capital of the Philippines}}</ref>

===Early history===
The town was then called by its native [[Gaddang people|Gaddang]] settlers as ''Bolo'' during the pre-Spanish conquest era. It was one of the populous settlements during that period and the site of the vast [[tobacco]] plantation in the region making it one of the most important economic areas in northern Luzon.

===Spanish colonial era===
In 1581, Governor-General [[Gonzalo Ronquillo de Peñalosa]] sent Capt. Juan Pablo Carreon to explore [[Cagayan Valley]] as well as to establish missions. Among the Spanish missionaries who penetrated deeply into the region was Pedro Jimenez, who founded Ilagan.

The town of Bolo was founded by the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] in 1619 in honor of [[Saint Ferdinand of Castile]]. The old Bolo was situated on the western side of [[Cagayan River]] in what is known today as barangay ''Naguilian-Baculod''. The cultural shock brought by the dominating social and economic regulations introduced by the Spanish authorities propelled the natives to dissent in the [[Mallig Plains|Mallig]] and the Ilagan-[[Tumauini, Isabela|Tumauini]] territories in what was known as the ''Gaddang Revolution''. The natives abandoned their settlement after burning their church and houses until 1622 when the Spanish government pardoned and exempted them from paying tribute within three years. After the Gaddang revolt, the natives re-established their settlement upon the efforts of Fr. Pedro Jimenez in 1678 on the east side of the river thereby giving the legendary name for Ilagan which is the reverse of the word ''nagali'' meaning ''move'' or ''transfer''. The Dominicans accepted the settlement as an ecclesiastical mission given the name ''San Fernando de Ilagan'' in honor of its patron, Saint Ferdinand of Castile.

====Foundation====
{{main|Municipalities of the Philippines}}
On May 4, 1686, Ilagan was founded and missionaries converted the natives to [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Catholicism]]. Ilagan was made the capital town of [[Cagayan Valley]] when Brig. Manuel Sanchez Mira was then the governor of the whole territory.

In 1763, Ilagan was the scene of the revolt led by Dabo and Juan Marayag<ref>{{Cite web|title=PARISH OF SAINT PAUL THE APOSTLE|url=http://saintpaul-cabagan.weebly.com/|access-date=October 25, 2021|website=St Paul The Apostle Parish}}</ref> against the collection of tribute, the enforcement of tobacco monopoly committed by the friars during the [[History of the Philippines (1565–1898)|Spanish colonization]].

On May 1, 1856, Ilagan became the capital town when ''[[Isabela (province)|Isabela de Luzon]]'' was founded.

===American colonial era===
Present-day Ilagan is an area that was detached from the old province of [[Nueva Vizcaya]]. The first municipal president of the town, Rafael Maramag, added luster to the history of his hometown by becoming the first governor of the province of [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]] after its reorganization by the [[Americans]] in 1901.

On August 4, 1901, the American occupation under the [[United States]]-[[Philippine Commission]] enacted the ''Provincial Government Act 210'' that re-established [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]] and other provinces in the Philippines. Rafael Maramag, a former municipal president (mayor) of Ilagan was appointed as the first governor. The act then re-established Ilagan as the provincial capital.

On November 13, 1925, Gaffud approved a resolution filed by all ''Municipal Presidents of the Isabela'' (the counterpart of the present-day [[League of Municipalities of the Philippines|Mayor's League]]) following a four-day convention. The resolution called for the erection of a monument in honor of the country's National Hero [[José Rizal]] in Ilagan public plaza located in barangay Bagumbayan.

===Japanese occupation===
The fortunes of [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]] as a province and Ilagan as a town followed a similar path to the rest of the country's history as a commonwealth nation and as a free republic in 1942, the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation]], liberation, political and military independence to this day.

On June 19, 1945, Ilagan was liberated from the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]] as part of the liberation campaign with the combined forces of 14th Infantry, [[United States Army Forces in the Philippines – Northern Luzon]] (USAFIP-NL), under the command of Lt Col. Romulo A. Manriquez, and the 37th Division of the U.S. Sixth Army against the Japanese.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Liberation of Ilagan, Isabela|url=https://pvao.gov.ph/story-of-battles-pvao/liberation-of-ilagan-isabela/|access-date=October 17, 2021|website=PVAO - The official website of the Philippine Veterans Affairs Office}}</ref>

During this era, a man-made [[Ilagan Japanese Tunnel|tunnel]] was constructed from the sweat and blood of detained Ilagueños and it is now a tourist destination in the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ilagan Japanese War Tunnel |url=https://cityofilagan.gov.ph/directions-going-to-ilagan-japanese-tunnel/ |access-date=January 14, 2023 |website=City of Ilagan}}</ref> The tunnels are believed to have served as headquarters of the Japanese soldiers.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Villano |first=Alexa |date=February 18, 2018 |title=Travel diaries: Discovering Isabela's rich history |work=Rappler.com |url=https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/195784-isabela-ilagan-sanctuary-japanese-tunnel/ |access-date=January 14, 2023}}</ref>

===The Postwar era===
By the turn of the 1950s, the new Poblacion was located uphill from the old Saint Ferdinand Parish Church, formerly known as Saint Ferdinand Cathedral in barangay Bagumbayan to barangay San Vicente, which is the site of the current City Hall.<ref>{{cite web| title = Ilagan: Death of a Town, Rise of a City| url = http://raymundwanderings.blogspot.com/2011/04/ilagan-death-of-town-rise-of-city.html#comment-form| publisher =Raymund Catindig| date= April 18, 2011| access-date=March 11, 2012}}</ref>

===The Martial Law era===
{{see also|Bishop Miguel Purugganan}}
When Ferdinand Marcos' September 1972 declaration of [[Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos|Martial law]] began 14 years of authoritarian rule, the province of [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]], including the municipality of Ilagan became a center of both conflict and protest when [[Marcos crony|Marcos cronies]] [[Danding Cojuangco]] and Antonio Carag managed to block a Spanish-era grant which was supposed to see the return of Hacienda San Antonio and Hacienda Santa Isabel in Ilagan to local farmers. Cojuangco and Carag purchased the two haciendas themselves, displacing tens of thousands of farmers who were supposed to get those lands back a hundred years after the Spanish acquired them.<ref name="BantayogPadillaSabino">{{Cite news |date=November 29, 2017 |title=PADILLA, Sabino "Abe" Garcia Jr. |language=en-US |url=http://www.bantayog.org/padilla-sabino-garcia-jr/ |access-date=September 9, 2020}}</ref>

In its desire to serve its parishioners, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ilagan]] hosted a Social Action Center which would help the farmers. In the Social Action Center's newsletter, the "Courier," researcher Sabino Padilla Jr. documented and exposed the ways by which Cojuangco, Carag, the provincial government, and the military harassed the farmers who were supposed to get the land. This all led to a protest march in joined by 12,000 protesters from all over [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]], and eventually, for 4,000 farmers to finally get the titles to their land. But it also earned the ire of the administration.<ref name="BantayogPadillaSabino"/><ref name="PuruggananProfile"/>

In 1982, Padilla and 12 others were arrested by the regime and jailed under poor conditions at the [[Bayombong]], [[Nueva Vizcaya]] Stockade of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] until almost the end of the Marcos regime.<ref name="BantayogPadillaSabino"/>

In 1983, soldiers went as far as to raid the residence of the Bishop of Ilagan, [[Miguel Purugganan]], in search of alleged rebels and firearms. They found none but continued to keep Bishop Puruggananan and the church workers under him under military surveillance.<ref name="PuruggananProfile">{{Cite web |date=October 9, 2015 |title=PURUGGANAN, Miguel Gatan |url=http://www.bantayog.org/purugganan-miguel-gatan/ |access-date=September 4, 2020 |website=Bantayog ng mga Bayani |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Demographics==

===Ethnicity===
Ilagueños today reflect a combination of indigenous, [[Chinese people|Chinese]], and [[Hispanic]] descent. The core community was composed of tribes notably the Agta, [[Ibanag people|Ibanag]], [[Gaddang people|Gaddang]], Yogad, and [[Kalinga people|Kalinga]] which mirrors the habitation of the Philippines believed to have started 26,000 years ago with various strains of [[Aeta people|Aetas]], then [[Indonesians]] coming 5,000 years ago and the [[Malayan race|Malays]] in droves starting 200 years B.C. up to 1500 A.D. Trade and cultural relations with [[Chinese people|Chinese]] preceded the 16th-century incursion of the [[Spaniards]]. [[Ilocano people|Ilocanos]] who already developed their own distinct traits were recorded to have migrated massively in the 19th century owing to the accessibility of the land and vast opportunities in the area straddling the present-day provinces of [[Cagayan (province)|Cagayan]] and [[Nueva Vizcaya]]. It was proclaimed a province by a Royal Decree and named ''[[Isabela (province)|Isabela de Luzon]]'' on the first day of May in 1856.

===Languages===
There are three native languages in Ilagan: [[Ibanag language|Ibanag]], [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]], and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], which make it a multilingual city. [[Philippine English|English]] is used primarily in communication for government publications, local newsprints, road signs, and commercial signs, and in doing official business transactions in the city.

===Population===
As of the 2020 census, Imelda Bliss Village is the most populous barangay with 7,951 people while Carikkikan Sur is the least populous barangay with just 208 people.<ref>{{Cite web |title=City of Ilagan |url=https://psa.gov.ph/classification/psgc/barangays/0203114000 |access-date=January 22, 2024 |website=Philipine Statistics Authority}}</ref>

===Tobacco industry===
Ilagan became one of the largest producers of tobacco during the [[History of the Philippines (1565–1898)|Spanish time]]. The [[tobacco]] monopoly caused the valley to languish in poverty from 1785 to 1797. The lifting of the monopoly was caused by the heavy loss incurred by the government. A royal decree was released in 1882 which aimed to abolish the monopoly and attracted foreign capitalists to invest in the country.

In Ilagan, the [[Compañía General de Tabacos de Filipinas]] also known as ''La Tabacalera'' was established in 1881 and produced the famous ''La Flor de la Isabela''<ref>{{Cite news|title=OUR HISTORY|url=https://tabacalera.com.ph/pages/our-history|access-date=October 24, 2021}}</ref> which was the largest company of its kind in the world at that time. The [[Compañía General de Tabacos de Filipinas|Tabacalera]] acquired two haciendas in Ilagan which were Hacienda San Antonio and Hacienda Santa Isabel. The majority of the western barangays of the municipality are planting tobacco other than rice, corn, and high-value crops.<ref>{{cite web|title=600 tobacco farmers receive livelihood assistance|url= https://pia.gov.ph/news/2022/07/20/600-tobacco-farmers-receive-livelihood-assistance |work=PIA|publisher=pia.gov.ph|access-date=July 20, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A season of contented tobacco farmers|url= https://www.philstar.com/business/agriculture/2005/09/11/296143/season-contented-tobacco-farmers/amp/ |work=Philstar Global|date= September 11, 2005 |publisher=philstar.com|access-date=September 11, 2005}}</ref> The [[Tobacco production in the Philippines|National Tobacco Administration]] is the attached agency under the [[Department of Agriculture (Philippines)|Department of Agriculture]] that is mandated to conduct series of efficacy trials, scientific experiments and tests on new agricultural products, inputs, systems, and processes being introduced.

==Government==

===Local government===
{{main|Mayor of Ilagan|Sangguniang Panlungsod|List of barangays in Ilagan#Barangay officials}}
As a [[Cities of the Philippines|component city]] and the [[Capital city|capital]] of the Province of [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]], government officials at the provincial level are voted by the electorates of the city. The provincial government has political jurisdiction over the local transactions of the city government.

The city of Ilagan is governed by a city mayor designated as its local chief executive and by a city council as its legislative body per the [[Philippine legal codes|Local Government Code]]. The mayor, vice mayor, and councilors are elected directly by the people through an election that is held every three years.

Barangays are also headed by elected officials: [[Barangay Captain]], [[Sangguniang Barangay|Barangay Council]], whose members are called [[Barangay Kagawad|Barangay Councilors]]. The [[barangay]]s have an [[Sangguniang Kabataan|SK federation]] which represents the barangay, headed by the SK chairperson and whose members are called SK councilors. All officials are also elected every three years.

===City Symbols===

====Seal====
[[File:Ph seal Ilagan.png|thumb|120px|City Seal of Ilagan]]
The city seal has an inscription of the city name "City of Ilagan" and the name of the province "Isabela" with the year 1686 as the foundation of the town and 2012 as the year of its cityhood declaration on a dark blue ring.

Within the ring, located at the upper-left portion, is a mountain representing the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre mountain ranges]], the longest mountain ranges in the Philippines. Nearby are two rivers representing the [[Cagayan River]] and [[Ilagan River]], showing that the Ilagan River flows westward from the Sierra Madre, joining the Cagayan River. The people near the center, colored yellow, represent the city's citizens, with the overlapping buildings and red gear representing city urbanization, and the municipal logo placed inside the gear as an homage to the city's past.

Near the upper-right are various agricultural symbols: a [[carabao]] horn (representing the prevalence of carabaos in the local farming industry), a [[sweet potato|''kamote'' or sweet potato]] (a major local root crop), [[corn]] (a major local crop representing the city's title as the Corn Capital of the Philippines), and a stalk of [[rice|''palay'' or unharvested rice]] (another major crop in the city, representing the city as a part of Asia given its nature as a staple food in the continent).

Another inscription is written at the bottom of the seal's inner portion: the Latin phrase ''Vox populi, Vox Dei'', meaning "the Voice of the People, the Voice of God."

The city's barangays also have their own seals which represent themselves.

====Flag====
[[File:Flag_of_Ilagan,_Isabela.png|thumb|240px|City Flag of Ilagan]]
The city flag, like many LGU flags in the Philippines, is a "seal on a bedsheet" (a derogatory term in [[Vexillology]] that refers to flags that use a solid color background with the seal of what the flag represents placed on top). More specifically, the flag has a background of [[light blue]] or [[Azure (color)|azure]] (the ''de facto'' city color of Ilagan) with the city seal on top.

The city flag has no official aspect ratio, although it is commonly reproduced with either a 1:2 ratio (like that of the Philippine national flag) or a 2:3 (like most other flags).

====Anthem/Hymn====
The current city anthem or hymn is the '''City of Ilagan Hymn''', composed by Ato Del Rosario and lyrics by Nilo Agustin.<ref name="current-anthem">{{cite web|title= City of Ilagan Hymn|url= https://www.facebook.com/share/v/E7sK65cj3NepCbdr/?mibextid=WC7FNe |work= Official Facebook Page of MyCity Ilagan | publisher=facebook.com/cityofilagan.gov.ph|access-date=October 9, 2023}}</ref> According to the city's [[Facebook]] page, the new hymn was inspired by the incumbent city mayor, Hon. Josemarie L. Diaz.<ref name="current-anthem"/> Although well-received, it does not yet seem to have widespread adoption for flag ceremonies in public schools like the former anthem did. <!-- please correct if false or outdated -->

The former city anthem was the '''Martsa ng Ilagan''' ({{translation|Ilagan March}}), composed by Rev. Fr. Ingeno Rapadas.<ref name="former-anthem">{{cite web|title= Sulong Ilagan March by Rev. Fr. Ingeno Rapadas|url= https://blogs.gerryyabes.com/2015/01/sulong-ilagan-march.html?m=1 |work=Gerry Yabes Blogs|publisher=blogs.gerryyabes.com|access-date=January 27, 2015}}</ref>

====Others====
The city, being called the ''Corn Capital of the Philippines'' is often symbolized by [[corn]], making it Ilagan's ''de facto'' city crop.

As mentioned previously, light blue or azure is a ''de facto'' city color. [[Golden yellow]] or [[Maize (color)|maize yellow]] is also a ''de facto'' city color, with both colors often being used by the city government across the city (especially on the sidewalks and poles along the [[Pan-Philippine Highway|national highway]]).

===Water and sewerage system===

'''City of Ilagan Water District (CIWD)'''. It is a government-owned and controlled corporation that is mandated to supply all the water needs of its concessionaires. It has managed to put up several pumping stations throughout the city to cater to the increasing demand of Ilagan's growing population and economy. Some residents and privately owned business entities have their own electric water pumps and some can up their own traditional deep wells for their own water needs and irrigation systems especially those residents from far-flung barangays who are not able to avail the service provided by the water district. Its main office is located in barangay Osmeña. Several water refilling stations have opened to serve as an alternative for the residents for their water needs. Also, the city government is continuously implementing solutions in line with the water and sewerage problems of the city such as the construction of deep wells in every barangay and the construction of drainages and canals in those areas affected by floods during the rainy and stormy season.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Historical Background|url=http://www.cityofilaganwaterdistrict.gov.ph/about-us.html|access-date=October 8, 2021|website=Welcome to Ilagan City Water District}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= DENR, STAKEHOLDERS TAKE ACTION TO TACKLE WATER-RELATED ISSUES|url= https://r2.denr.gov.ph/index.php/news-events/provincial-releases/1549-denr-stakeholders-take-action-to-tackle-water-related-issues |work=DENR|publisher=r2.denr.gov.ph|access-date=March 22, 2022}}</ref>

'''Pasa Small Reservoir Irrigation Project (PSRIP)'''. The irrigation project is a $21.7 million government project in barangay Pasa, a joint undertaking between the South Korean government, through the Korea International Cooperation Agency (Koica), and the Philippines, through the [[National Irrigation Administration]] and the local government of Isabela. The project entailed the construction of a 34-meter high earth-filled dam across the Pasa River, a reservoir with an active storage of 3.90 million cubic meters, with 5.93 kilometers of a main canal and 16.20 kilometers of lateral canals. According to authorities and government officials, the project is said to be under South Korea's five-year program under the East Asia Climate Change Partnership to [[climate change mitigation|address climate change]] and to bolster Green Growth in Asia. It was built to help mitigate floods with its small water impounding or catchment basin features aside from irrigating more farmlands in the province, the project is also aimed at reducing the [[effects of climate change|impact of climate change]] and promoting water management in rural areas. The dam is expected to irrigate eight hundred (800) hectares of farmlands, covering the barangays of Pasa, Santa Victoria, Fuyo, Morado, and Minabang, all within Ilagan City, and should benefit seven hundred forty-seven (747) families in the province of Isabela. Also, the authorities added that the Pasa Dam project would further fortify Isabela as the country's leading agriculture province, which has kept the title as a top corn producer and second in rice production.<ref>{{cite news|title=$21.7M Korea-funded dam to reduce Isabela flooding|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/21-7m-korea-funded-dam-to-reduce-isabela-flooding/236489/|work=The Manila Times|access-date=December 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=P1-B Pasa Dam activated in Isabela|url= https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1007481/p1-b-pasa-dam-activated-in-isabela/amp |work=Inquirer|publisher=newsinfo.inquirer.net|access-date=July 5, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Korea-funded Pasa Dam breaks ground in Isabela|url= https://www.manilatimes.net/2013/07/06/news/regions/korea-funded-pasa-dam-breaks-ground-in-isabela/16390/amp |work=The Manila Times|date= July 6, 2013 |publisher=manilatimes.net|access-date=July 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= NIA SWITCHES ON P1.029-BILLION PASA SRIP |url= https://www.nia.gov.ph/?q=monthly-archives/201807 |work= Official Website of the National Irrigation Administration PH | publisher=nia.gov.ph|access-date=July 11, 2018}}</ref>
