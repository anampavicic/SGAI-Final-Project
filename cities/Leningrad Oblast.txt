'''Leningrad Oblast''' ({{langx|ru|Ленинградская область|Leningradskaya oblast’}}, {{IPA|ru|lʲɪnʲɪnˈgratskəjə ˈobləsʲtʲ|IPA}}; {{Langx|vep|Leningradan agj}}; {{Langx|fi|Leningradin alue}}) is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (an [[oblast]]). The oblast has an area of {{convert|84500|km2}} and a population of 2,000,997 ([[2021 Russian census|2021 Census]]);<ref name="2010Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}</ref> up from 1,716,868 recorded in the [[2010 Russian census|2010 Census]].<ref name="2002Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2002Census}}</ref> Leningrad Oblast is highly industrialized.

The oblast was established on 1 August 1927, although it was not until 1946 that the oblast's borders had been mostly settled in their present position. The oblast was named after the city of [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]. In 1991, the city restored its original name, [[Saint Petersburg]], but the oblast retains the name of Leningrad. It overlaps the historical region of [[Ingria]], and is bordered by [[Finland]] ([[Kymenlaakso]] and [[South Karelia]]) in the northwest and [[Estonia]] ([[Ida-Viru County]]) in the west, as well as five federal subjects of Russia: the [[Republic of Karelia]] in the northeast, [[Vologda Oblast]] in the east, [[Novgorod Oblast]] in the south, [[Pskov Oblast]] in the southwest, and the federal city of [[Saint Petersburg]] in the west.

The first governor of Leningrad Oblast was [[Vadim Gustov]] (in 1996–1998). The current governor, since 2012, is [[Aleksandr Drozdenko]].

==Geography==
[[File:Monrepos 0550.jpg|right|thumb|Monrepos Park in [[Vyborg]]]]
[[File:Приозерск - Вуокса - парк.jpg|right|thumb|The Vuoksi in [[Priozersk]]]]
[[File:Oredezh river.jpg|thumb|The [[Oredezh River]] near [[Siversky]]]]
Leningrad Oblast is located around the [[Gulf of Finland]] and south of two great freshwater lakes, [[Lake Ladoga]] and [[Lake Onega]]. The oblast includes the [[Karelian Isthmus]] and some islands, including [[Gogland]] in the Gulf of Finland and [[Konevets]] in Lake Ladoga.

Much of the area of the oblast belongs to the [[drainage basin]] of the [[Neva River|Neva]], which is the only outflow of Lake Ladoga. The Neva, which flows to the Gulf of Finland (the city of Saint Petersburg is located in its [[river delta]]) is relatively short, but its drainage basin is very large, including Lake Onega and [[Lake Ilmen]]. The [[Svir River|Svir]] and the [[Volkhov River|Volkhov]] flow from Lake Onega and Lake Ilmen, respectively, to Lake Ladoga. Other major tributaries of Lake Ladoga include the [[Vuoksi River|Vuoksi]] and the [[Syas River|Syas]]. Rivers in the western part of the oblast flow to the Gulf of Finland; the two biggest rivers there are the [[Luga River|Luga]] and the [[Narva River|Narva]], which forms the border of Russia and Estonia. Small areas in the east of the oblast lie within the river basin of the [[Chagodoshcha River|Chagodoshcha]], a tributary of the [[Mologa River|Mologa]], and of the [[Suda River|Suda]], both within the [[Volga River|Volga]] basin. A [[ridgeline]] in [[Tikhvinsky District]] in the eastern oblast forms part of the divide between the Baltic Sea and Caspian Sea basins.

The terrain of Leningrad Oblast is relatively flat and mostly covered with forest and swamps. An exception is the rocky [[Karelian Isthmus]], which contains a lake district, as well as the [[Vepsian Upland]] in the east. The biggest lakes on the isthmus are [[Vuoksi River|Lake Vuoksa]], [[Lake Sukhodolskoye]], and [[Lake Otradnoye]].

Leningrad Oblast contains two federally protected natural areas, the [[Nizhnesvirsky Nature Reserve]] and [[Mshinskoye Boloto Zakaznik]], both created to protect the forest and swamp landscapes of northwestern Russia.

===Flora===
The most taxonomically diverse vascular plant families are [[Asteraceae]], [[Cyperaceae]], [[Poaceae]] and [[Rosaceae]]. By far the most diverse genus is ''[[Carex]]'' (68 species). The diversity in genera ''[[Hieracium]]'' (with ''Pilosella''), ''[[Ranunculus]]'' (with ''Batrachium''), ''[[Alchemilla]]'', ''[[Galium]]'', ''[[Potamogeton]]'', ''[[Salix]]'', ''[[Veronica (plant)|Veronica]]'', ''[[Viola (plant)|Viola]]'', ''[[Juncus]]'', ''[[Artemisia (plant)|Artemisia]]'', ''[[Potentilla]]'', ''[[Rumex]]'', ''[[Festuca]]'', ''[[Epilobium]]'', ''[[Poa]]'', ''[[Trifolium]]'', ''[[Campanula]]'', ''[[Vicia]]'', ''[[Lathyrus]]'', ''[[Geranium]]'' is also considerable. The territory has no endemic plant taxa. Vascular plant species of Leningrad Oblast listed in the red data book of Russia are ''[[Botrychium simplex]]'', ''[[Cephalanthera rubra]]'', ''[[Cypripedium calceolus]]'', ''[[Epipogium aphyllum]]'', ''[[Lobelia dortmanna]]'', ''[[Myrica gale]]'', ''[[Ophrys insectifera]]'', ''[[Orchis militaris]]'', ''[[Pulsatilla pratensis]]'', ''[[Pulsatilla vernalis]]''.

[[File:Вид на крепость и пришвартованная ладья.JPG|thumb|The fortress in [[Staraya Ladoga]]]]
[[File:Ivangorod fortress as seen from top of Hermann Castle.jpg|right|thumb|Ivangorod fortress]]
The territory of present-day Leningrad Oblast was populated shortly after the end of the [[Weichselian glaciation]] and now hosts numerous archaeological remnants.<ref name="Lapshin1">Лапшин В. А. "Археологическая карта Ленинградской области. Часть 1: Западные районы". Leningrad, 1990.</ref><ref name="Lapshin2">Лапшин В. А. "Археологическая карта Ленинградской области.

Leningrad: Лениздат, 1977.
</ref> The [[Volga trade route]] and [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]] crossed the territory. [[Staraya Ladoga]], the first capital of legendary [[Rurik]], founded in the 8th-9th century, is situated in the east of the oblast, on the [[Volkhov River]].

In the 12th-15th centuries, the territory was divided between the [[Kingdom of Sweden]] and [[Novgorod Republic]] (see [[Swedish-Novgorodian Wars]]) and populated mostly by various [[Baltic Finns]] people such as [[Karelians]] (northwest), [[Izhorians]] and [[Votians|Votes]] (west), [[Vepsians]] (east), as well as [[Ilmen Slavs]] of Novgorod (south). During the [[Russo-Swedish Wars]] of the 15th-17th centuries, the border moved back and forth over the land.

The central part of the territory is known as the historical region of [[Ingria]] (or the land of Izhora) and in the 17th century, after most of the present-day territory of Leningrad Oblast was captured by Sweden with the [[Treaty of Stolbovo]] of 1617, became subject to substantial Finnish Lutheran population influx from [[Finnish Karelia]] (which included [[Karelian Isthmus]], the northwestern part of present-day Leningrad Oblast) and [[Savonia (historical province)|Savonia]]. Having faced religious pressure from Lutheran pastors and Swedish authorities, the local Orthodox population of Russian and Finnic ancestry massively fled from Ingria to neighbour Russian provinces, so [[Ingrian Finns]] soon became the dominant ethnic group.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NzR0cmnP3J8C&pg=PA495|title=The Cambridge History of Russia: Volume 2, Imperial Russia, 1689-1917|last=Lieven|first=Dominic|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=0521815290|pages=495}}</ref>

During the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721) the territory of what is now Leningrad Oblast was conquered from Sweden by Russia under [[Peter the Great]], who founded [[Saint Petersburg]] amidst the land in 1703, which soon became the capital of the [[Russian Empire]].  In 1708, most of the territory was organized into [[Saint Petersburg Governorate|Ingermanland Governorate]] under Governor General [[Alexander Danilovich Menshikov|Alexander Menshikov]]. It was renamed Saint Petersburg Governorate in 1710 (the borders of that governorate, however, differed very significantly from those of the present-day oblast and included much of the areas of current Novgorod, Pskov, and Vologda Oblasts). In 1721, the territorial concessions of Sweden were confirmed with the [[Treaty of Nystad]].

The life of the countryside was greatly influenced by the vicinity of the imperial capital, which became a growing market for its agricultural production as well as the main consumer of its mineral and forest resources. In 1719–1810, [[Ladoga Canal]] was dug between the [[Svir River]] and the [[Neva River]] as part of the Volga-Baltic waterway to bypass stormy waters of [[Lake Ladoga]]. Since the advent of rail transport in the late 19th century, the areas in the vicinity of Saint Petersburg had been popular summer resort destinations ([[dacha]]s) for its residents. However, while Saint Petersburg itself was populated mostly by Russians from the very beginning, it was not until the 20th century that its surrounding population was Russified.

In 1914, with the beginning of [[World War I]], Saint Petersburg was renamed Petrograd and the governorate was accordingly renamed Petrograd Governorate. After the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], in 1918, the capital was transferred from Petrograd to [[Moscow]], farther from the borders of the country. In 1919, during the [[Russian Civil War]], the Northwestern [[White Army]] advancing from Estonia and led by [[Nikolai Yudenich]] tried to capture Petrograd and even managed to reach its southern outskirts, but the attack against the Red Army under [[Leon Trotsky]] ultimately failed, and Yudenich retreated. The border with Estonia was established in the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Russian-Estonian Treaty of Tartu]] of 1920. [[Heimosodat|Finland-backed]] Ingrian Finns of [[North Ingria]] attempted to secede in 1918–1920, but were incorporated back with the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Finnish)|Russian-Finnish Treaty of Tartu]], which settled the border between Finland and Soviet Russia. In 1924, Petrograd was renamed Leningrad, and Petrograd Governorate was again renamed accordingly (Leningrad Governorate).

===Leningrad Oblast===
Leningrad Oblast was established on 1 August 1927, by the resolutions of the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] "On the Establishment of Leningrad Oblast" and "On the Borders and Composition of the Okrugs of Leningrad Oblast"<ref name="ATSBookMurm">''Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast'', pp.&nbsp;33–34</ref> by merging [[Cherepovets Governorate|Cherepovets]], Leningrad, [[Murmansk Governorate|Murmansk]], [[Novgorod Governorate|Novgorod]], and [[Pskov Governorate]]s. The territory of the oblast corresponded to the modern territories of the present-day Leningrad Oblast (with the exception of the [[Karelian Isthmus]] and the territories along the border with Estonia), [[Novgorod Oblast]], [[Pskov Oblast]], parts of [[Vologda Oblast]], most of [[Murmansk Oblast]], and the federal city of Saint Petersburg. The total area of the oblast was {{convert|360400|km2|sqmi}};<ref name="ATSBookLengr">''Administrative-Territorial Division of Leningrad Oblast'', p.&nbsp;10</ref> more than four times larger than the modern entity. Administratively, the oblast was divided into nine [[okrug]]s ([[Borovichi Okrug|Borovichi]], [[Cherepovets Okrug|Cherepovets]], [[Leningrad Okrug|Leningrad]], [[Lodeynoye Pole Okrug|Lodeynoye Pole]], [[Luga Okrug|Luga]], [[Murmansk Okrug|Murmansk]], [[Novgorod Okrug|Novgorod]], [[Pskov Okrug|Pskov]], and [[Velikiye Luki Okrug|Velikiye Luki]]), each of which was in turn subdivided into [[raion|district]]s.<ref name="ATSBookLengr" />

In 1929, [[Velikiye Luki Okrug]] was transferred to newly formed [[Western Oblast]]. Leningrad was administratively separated from Leningrad Oblast in December 1931. In 1935 five southernmost districts were made part of [[Kalinin Oblast]]. In 1936 some parts of the territory of [[Leningrad Suburban District]] of Leningrad was returned to Leningrad Oblast and divided into [[Vsevolozhsky District]], [[Krasnoselsky District, Saint Petersburg|Krasnoselsky District]], [[Pargolovsky District]] and [[Slutsky District]] (renamed Pavlovsky District in 1944). [[Vologda Oblast]], which has included the easternmost districts of Leningrad Oblast (former Cherepovets Governorate), was created in 1937. [[Murmansk Oblast]] was split from Leningrad Oblast in 1938.

In the autumn of 1934, the [[Border Security Zone of Russia|Forbidden Border Zone]] along the western border of the Soviet Union was established, where nobody could appear without special permission issued by the [[NKVD]]. It was officially only 7.5&nbsp;km deep initially, but along the Estonian border it extended to as much as 90&nbsp;km. The zone was to be cleansed of Finnic and other peoples who were considered "politically unreliable" by the regime.<ref name="matley">{{cite journal

  }}</ref> Starting from the 1929, the Soviet authorities carried out [[Deportations of the Ingrian Finns|mass deportations]] of the [[Ingrian Finn]]ish population of the oblast, which constituted the majority in many rural localities as late as in the beginning of the 20th century, to the east, replacing them with people from other parts of the Soviet Union.

On 30 November 1939, the Soviet Union waged the [[Winter War]] against neighbouring Finland and with the [[Moscow Peace Treaty]] in 1940 gained some territories, including the [[Karelian Isthmus]]. Their Karelian population was [[evacuation of Finnish Karelia|hastily evacuated]] to inner Finland and later replaced with people from other parts of the Soviet Union. A small part of the territory (the municipalities of [[Pobeda, Leningrad Oblast|Kanneljärvi]], [[Primorsk, Leningrad Oblast|Koivisto]] and [[Sosnovo, Priozersky District, Leningrad Oblast|Rautu]]) was incorporated into Leningrad Oblast, the rest being included within the [[Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic]].

In 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in [[Operation Barbarossa]], and shortly thereafter the territory became the site of the [[Battle of Leningrad]]. The Wehrmacht captured the southwestern part of the oblast and reached [[Tikhvin]] in the east, while Finnish troops [[Finnish reconquest of the Karelian Isthmus (1941)|quickly recaptured the ceded territories]] in the [[Continuation War]], encircling Leningrad from the land. In 1944 Soviet offensives managed to expel the Wehrmacht and [[fourth strategic offensive|put military pressure]] on Finland, which ceded the [[Karelian Isthmus]] again in the [[Moscow Armistice]] of September 19, 1944. This time the newly acquired territories on the isthmus were incorporated into the Leningrad Oblast ([[Vyborgsky District, Leningrad Oblast|Vyborgsky]] and [[Priozersky District]]s). In 1947 the territorial gains were confirmed with the [[Paris Peace Treaty]]. [[Novgorod Oblast|Novgorod]] and [[Pskov Oblast]]s were formed out of the southern parts of Leningrad Oblast in 1944. In January 1945 a small part of the [[Estonian SSR]] to the east of the [[River Narva]] with the town of [[Jaanilinn]] (now Ivangorod) was transferred to the [[Russian SFSR]] and incorporated into Leningrad Oblast. Since then, the territory of Leningrad Oblast has not changed significantly, although some suburbs of Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) have been excluded from the oblast and incorporated into the city.<ref>[http://lenobltrans.narod.ru/adm1.html Ленинградская область в целом: Административно-территориальное деление Ленинградской области] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608000817/http://lenobltrans.narod.ru/adm1.html |date=June 8, 2009 }}</ref> In October 1946 Leningrad gained from the oblast some former Finnish territories along the northern coast of the [[Gulf of Finland]] divided into [[Sestroretsky District]] and [[Kurortny District]], including the town of [[Terijoki]].

In 1953, [[Pavlovsky District, Leningrad Oblast|Pavlovsky District]] of the oblast was abolished, and parts of its territory including Pavlovsk were made subordinate to Leningrad. In 1954 the settlements [[Levashovo, Saint Petersburg|Levashovo]], [[Pargolovo]] and [[Pesochny, Russia|Pesochny]] were also transferred to Leningrad. In 1956 [[Boksitogorsky District]] of Leningrad Oblast gained a small territory of [[Novgorod Oblast]]. [[Uritsk]] was transferred from the oblast to the city of Leningrad in 1963, [[Krasnoye Selo]] and several settlements nearby—in 1973, [[Lomonosov, Russia|Lomonosov]]—in 1978.

After a referendum in 1991, the city of Leningrad was renamed back to Saint Petersburg, but Leningrad Oblast retained its name.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://og47.ru/2018/03/14/Chto-i-pochemu-pereimenovyvali-v-Leningradskoi-oblasti--2381|script-title=ru:Что и почему переименовывали в Ленинградской области|work=Общая газета Ленинградской области|access-date=2018-03-20|language=ru}}</ref> On 13 June 1996, Leningrad Oblast, alongside [[Tver Oblast]] and [[Saint Petersburg]], signed a power-sharing agreement with the federal government, granting it autonomy.<ref name= "newsline">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1141193.html|title=Newsline - June 14, 1996 Yeltsin Signs More Power-Sharing Agreements|date=1996-06-14|website=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|language=en|access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref> This agreement would be abolished on 18 April 2002.<ref name= "demokratiztsiya">{{Cite journal|last=Chuman|first=Mizuki|title=The Rise and Fall of Power-Sharing Treaties Between Center and Regions in Post-Soviet Russia|url=http://demokratizatsiya.pub/archives/19_2_L7H017206G216817.pdf|journal=Demokratizatsiya|pages=146}}</ref>

While the district is a part of Leningrad Oblast, Lomonosov is located within the [[federal cities of Russia|federal city]] of [[Saint Petersburg]].

==Economy==

===Industry===
The oblast, particularly the areas adjacent to Saint Petersburg, is heavily industrialized. The major enterprises include the [[Kinef|oil refinery]] in Kirishi, the Ford car assembly plant, Hyundai Russia assembly plant and the Rexam PLC Beverage Can Europe and Asia packaging plant in Vsevolozhsk, the paper mill in Syssstroy, and the paper mill and the plant producing oil platforms in Vyborg, and the [[Tikhvin industrial site]] in Tikhvin.

===Agriculture===
The main agricultural specializations of the oblast are cattle breeding with meat and milk production and poultry production. The main agricultural lands are in the east and in the southwest of the oblast.

===Transportation===
[[File:ДТ1-008, станция Веймарн.jpg|right|thumb|[[DT1 multiple unit]] [[Diesel locomotive|Diesel train]] in Veymarn]]
Saint-Petersburg is a major railway hub, and all railways running to it cross also Leningrad Oblast. They connect Saint-Petersburg with Moscow ([[Saint Petersburg – Moscow Railway]]), [[Helsinki]] via [[Vyborg]], [[Murmansk]] via [[Petrozavodsk]], [[Sortavala]] via [[Priozersk]], [[Tallinn]] via [[Kingisepp]], [[Riga]] via [[Pskov]], [[Vitebsk]] via [[Dno]], and [[Veliky Novgorod]]. There is a network of railways at the [[Karelian Isthmus]], in particular, connecting Vyborg and Priozersk, as well as south of Saint-Petersburg. There also railway lines connecting [[Veymarn]] with [[Slantsy, Leningrad Oblast|Slantsy]], Veymarn with [[Petergof]] via [[Sosnovy Bor]], [[Mga]] with [[Sonkovo]] via [[Kirishi]], [[Volkhov]] with [[Vologda]] via [[Tikhvin]] and [[Cherepovets]], Volkhov with [[Chudovo, Chudovsky District, Novgorod Oblast|Chudovo]], and [[Lodeynoye Pole]] with Sortavala via [[Olonets]]. Most of them support intensive passenger and cargo traffic.

Paved roads well cover the western and the central parts of Leningrad Oblast. The [[M10 highway (Russia)|M10 highway]] connects Saint Petersburg with Moscow via Veliky Novgorod in the south and with the Finnish border, continuing across the border to Helsinki, in the north. It is split between European routes [[European route E18|E18]] (Saint Petersburg to Finland) and [[European route E105|E105]] (Saint Petersburg to Moscow), and much of it within the oblast is built as a dual carriageway. [[R21 highway (Russia)|R21 highway]] (also part of E105) runs from Saint Petersburg to Murmansk via Petrozavodsk, and [[A180 highway (Russia)|A180]] (part of [[European route E20|E20]]) connects Saint Petersburg with [[Ivangorod]] and continues across the Estonian border to Tallinn. [[R23 highway (Russia)|R23]] connects Saint Petersburg with Pskov; it is a part of the [[European route E95|E95]]. [[A114 highway (Russia)|A114]] runs to Vologda via Cherepovets. A [[Moscow–Saint Petersburg motorway|paid motorway between Saint Petersburg and Moscow]] and the new A121 from Saint-Petersburg to [[Sortavala]], around the Western coast of Ladoga<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rudorogi.ru/roads/highway/a121.html|script-title=ru:Трасса А121 "Сортавала" (бывш. А129) на карте|website=www.rudorogi.ru|language=ru|access-date=2018-03-20}}</ref> are under construction. Roads are well served by bus traffic.

The [[Luga River|Luga]], the [[Svir River|Svir]], the [[Volkhov River|Volkhov]], and the [[Neva River|Neva]] are all navigable and heavily user for cargo transport, however, there is no scheduled passenger navigation within the oblast, except for seasonal leisure river cruises from Saint-Petersburg. The [[Onega Canal]], shared with Vologda Oblast, serves as a bypass of [[Lake Onega]] from the south. Similarly, the [[Ladoga Canal]] bypasses [[Lake Ladoga]] from the east, from the Svir to the Neva. It is a part of the [[Volga–Baltic Waterway]]. In contrast, the [[Tikhvinskaya water system]], connecting the [[Syas River|Syas]] and the [[Mologa River|Mologa]], which provided access from the Ladoga to the river basin of the Volga, is disused. The trans-border [[Saimaa Canal]] connects [[Saimaa|Lake Saimaa]] in Finland with the Gulf of Finland, has special status, and is occasionally used for passenger navigation.

[[Ust-Luga]], [[Vyborg]], [[Vysotsk]], and [[Primorsk, Leningrad Oblast|Primorsk]] are the major sea terminals on the Gulf of Finland.

There is a number of [[Aerodrome|airfields]] in Leningrad oblast that are now used only by the [[general aviation]]. Scheduled and international flights are available exclusively from [[Pulkovo Airport|Pulkovo airport]] in Saint-Petersburg.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://tass.ru/ekonomika/4448949|script-title=ru:Соколов: аэропорт Сиверский в Ленобласти может работать как порт малой авиации|work=ТАСС|access-date=2018-03-20|language=ru}}</ref>

[[File:Верхнесвирская ГЭС (8).JPG|right|thumb|Lock at the [[Upper Svir Hydroelectric Station]].]]
The [[Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant]] is located in the city of [[Sosnovy Bor, Leningrad Oblast|Sosnovy Bor]]. There are four major hydroelectric plants in the oblast. The [[Volkhov Hydroelectric Station]], on the Volkhov River, was constructed in 1921 and became the first major hydropower station in the Soviet Union. The others are the [[Upper Svir Hydroelectric Station]] and the [[Lower Svir Hydroelectric Station]], both on the Svir River, and the [[Narva Hydroelectric Station]] on the Narva River.

===Science and technology===
There are many science and high-tech institutions around Saint Petersburg, some of which are located in the oblast. For example, Gatchina is the site of the {{ill|Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute|ru|Петербургский институт ядерной физики имени Б. П. Константинова}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pnpi.nw.ru/|title=Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute. National Research Centre "Kurchatov Institute"|work=pnpi.spb.ru|access-date=November 6, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104214118/http://www.pnpi.spb.ru/index.html.en|archive-date=November 4, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and Sosnovy Bor hosts the Research Institute of Optical and Electronic Devices.

===Architecture===
[[File:Vyborg June2012 View from Olaf Tower 06.jpg|right|thumb|The historical center of Vyborg]]
[[File:Гиморецкий погост.jpg|right|thumb|The Gimreka Ensemble]]
Since prehistory, the Volkhov and the Neva Rivers were constituents of major trade routes, and archaeological sites dot their banks. [[Staraya Ladoga]] has many pre-1700 sites, including two of about a couple of dozens standing [[List of buildings of pre-Mongol Rus|pre-Mongol churches]] in Russia. Both of them were built in the 1160s. The [[Oreshek Fortress]] in [[Shlisselburg]] and the [[Koporye|Koporye Fortress]], both built in the 14th century, and the [[Ivangorod Fortress]], originally built in 1492, are excellent examples of Russian fortification art. Podporozhsky District contains the best samples of wooden ecclesiastical architecture in Leningrad Oblast, some of which are collectively referred to as ''Podporozhye Ring'': The Resurrection Church in the settlement of [[Vazhiny]], the Saint Nicholas Church in the village of [[Soginitsy]], the Sts Peter and Paul Chapel in the village of [[Zaozerye, Podporozhsky District, Leningrad Oblast|Zaozerye]], and the Saint Athanasy chapel in the village of [[Posad, Leningrad Oblast|Posad]]. The two other notable wooden churches are located in the villages of [[Gimreka]] and [[Shcheleyki]] close to the Onega Lakeshore. The center of [[Vyborg]] preserves many examples of medieval Swedish architecture, unique for Russia.

After Saint Petersburg was founded in 1703, many estates and residences were founded around the city. Some of them still stand and are listed as World Heritage sites, aggregated into the site of [[Historic Centre of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments]]. includes, among others, estates in [[Gostilitsy]], [[Ropsha]], and [[Taytsy]].

Localities in the Karelian Isthmus preserve some fine inter-war Finnish architecture. The best-known example is the [[Vyborg Library|Viipuri Municipal Library]] by [[Alvar Aalto]].
