Administratively the commune of Parakou makes up one of Benin's 77 communes. Since 2015, its mayor is Souradjou Adamou Karimou.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

== History ==
The city was founded in the 16th century by traders.<ref>Mathurin C. Houngnikpo, Samuel Decalo, ''Historical Dictionary of Benin'', Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2013, p. 281</ref> Among traders there is a first occupant of the Old City, a  hunter named sina kpebiegi.<ref>{{Cite web |title=La royauté de parakou |url=https://www.voyage-benin.com |website=www.voyage-benin.com}}</ref> This hunter was  from baatonou community. Even the traditional leaders are living from slaves trade the population are living from fishing and agriculture.

==Economy==
Parakou lies on the main north-south highway [[RNIE 2]] and at the end of a railway to [[Cotonou]].

=== Markets ===
This has made it an important [[market town]], with major industries including cotton and textiles, peanut oil manufacture and brewing. The town grew initially from revenue generated from passing merchants that took goods from the region across the [[Sahara]] and the [[Mediterranean]] to Europe.<ref name="Bradt">Butler, Stuart (2019) ''Bradt Travel Guide - Benin'', pgs. 177-180</ref> Parakou later became well known in the [[History of slavery|slave trade]].<ref name="Bradt"/> Later traders concentrated on cotton and Parakou remains the hub of the Beninese cotton trade to this day, with considerable interest from Europe.<ref name="Bradt"/>
[[File:Parakouinternationalmarket.jpg|thumb|left|The Grand Marché Arzeke international market]]
There are several markets trading, notably the largest, Grand Marché Arzeke which one of the largest in Benin, an international market spanning over a block.<ref>{{Harvnb|Butler|2006|p=192}}.</ref> This market has a large covered hall overlapping onto the streets with stalls, with 500 and 1000 vendors. The market sells an enormous range of goods from items of [[pottery]] including vases and bowls, to cotton textiles, cassettes and CD's of local and international artists, local spices, fruits, gasaru/wagasi (cow's milk cheese) and kitchen utensils.<ref name="Tourism">{{cite web|url=http://www.benintourism.com/en/interne.php?idrub=2&id=12|title=Parakou|publisher=Benintourism.com|access-date=January 10, 2009}}</ref> Another market, located several blocks north, is called the "Marché Kobo Kobo", which lies across the street from the French Cultural Centre.<ref name="Bradt"/> Marché Kobo Kobo is known for its clothing retailing, primarily second hand goods, and in another section livestock.<ref name="Bradt"/> The Marché Depot is located near Parakou Railway Station around numerous hotels and sells mostly food but also calabashes and baskets. There is also the Marché Guema, located next to Guema Church on the northern road to [[Malanville]] in the Albarika quarter of the city. The market was founded by the [[Somba (ethnic group)|Somba]] people of the [[Atacora]], and takes place every Sunday at 10&nbsp;am. The market consists of a collection of grass huts, and specialises in beef and pork and local millet beer known as [[choukachou]] or simply "chouk".<ref name="Tourism"/>

Parakou is the site of a proposed [[inland port]].<ref>[https://epinedorsale.com/EN/ Inland Port]</ref>

The dry port is a multi-modal platform located 3&nbsp;km from the centre of Parakou, close to the railway.  It gives the [[Backbone Project]] a strategic position for imports and exports to neighbouring countries, notably Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Nigeria and Togo.

==Demographics==
[[File:Parakouroundabout.jpg|thumb|left|A roundabout in Parakou]]
The name, Parakou, is derived from a Dendi word meaning "the city of everyone", named for the city's diversity of ethnicities.<ref name="Tourism"/> As a market town attracting many people as a trading and stop-off point, Parakou has a large mix of African ethnicities, including [[Fula people|Fula]], [[Dendi people|Dendi]], [[Somba (ethnic group)|Somba]], [[Fon people|Fon]], [[Gen language|Mina]], [[Bariba people|Bariba]], [[Zarma people|Djerma]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] (of the Nago tribe), [[Hausa people|Hausa]], [[Kabrais]], [[Warma people|Warma]],<ref>In {{langx|ff|Fulɓe}}; in {{langx|fr|link=no|Peul}} or {{lang|fr|Peulh}}.</ref> and [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]].<ref name="Tourism"/>

In 1979 the city was reported as having 60,915 people and according to the official census of 1992, Parakou had a population of 103,577.
