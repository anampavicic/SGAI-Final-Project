'''Secunderabad''' is a [[twin cities|twin city]] of [[Hyderabad]] and one of the six zones of the [[Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation]] (GHMC) in the [[States and union territories of India|Indian state]] of [[Telangana]]. It is the headquarters of the [[South Central Railway zone]]. Named after the [[Mir Akbar Ali Khan Sikander Jah, Asaf Jah III]], [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizam]] of the [[Asaf Jahi dynasty]], Secunderabad was established in 1806 as a British [[cantonment]]. Although both the cities are together referred to as the [[twin cities]], [[Hyderabad]] and Secunderabad have different histories and cultures, with Secunderabad having developed directly under [[British Raj|British rule]] until 1948, and Hyderabad as the capital of the [[Nizam]]s' [[Hyderabad State|princely state of Hyderabad]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hyderabad-secunderabad.com/history.htm |title=Hyderabad-Secunderabad India – History -hyderabad-secunderabad.com<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=13 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224040023/http://www.hyderabad-secunderabad.com/history.htm |archive-date=24 February 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> Since 1956, the city has housed the [[Rashtrapati Nilayam]], the winter office of the [[president of India]]. It is also the headquarter of the [[54th Infantry Division (India)|54th Infantry Division]] of the [[Indian Army]].

Geographically divided from Hyderabad by the [[Hussain Sagar]] lake, Secunderabad is no longer a separate municipal unit and has become part of Hyderabad's Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. Both cities are collectively known as Hyderabad and together form the [[List of metropolitan areas in India|sixth-largest metropolis in India]]. Being one of the largest cantonments in India, Secunderabad has a large presence of [[Indian Army|army]] and [[Indian Air Force|air force]] personnel.<ref>[http://www.indiastudychannel.com/experts/13416-Whats-difference-between-Cantonment-Municipality.aspx it has one of the largest railway stations which serves for both the cities as Hyderabad does not have any railway stationIndiastudychannel.com]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://scb.aponline.gov.in/SCBPortal/SCBHomePage.aspx |title=SCB.aponline.gov.in |access-date=2 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913012924/http://scb.aponline.gov.in/SCBPortal/SCBHomePage.aspx |archive-date=13 September 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Secunderabad also has a large number of lakes, with the northern part of the [[Hussain Sagar|Hussain Sagar Lake]] being a part of the city and [[Fox Sagar Lake]] being the largest lake in Secunderabad. The city also houses the famous [[Ramoji Film City]].

In 1310, the area of present-day Hyderabad and Secunderabad came under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] after the [[Siege of Warangal (1310)|capture of Warangal]], the [[Kakatiya]] capital. The modern city of Hyderabad was built and founded in 1592 by the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty|Golconda Sultanate]] under [[Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah]]. The modern Secunderabad is also the site where the then [[Mughal emperor]] [[Ahmad Shah Bahadur]] was defeated in the year 1754 by the [[Maratha Empire]]; the emperor arrived after the death of [[Nawab]] [[Anwaruddin Khan]] nearby at the [[Battle of Ambur]] in 1749. [[Anwaruddin Khan]] was the [[Nawab of Arcot]].

The drinking water needs of the British army in the cantonment and civilians in cantonment area (areas now under Marredpally, Bowenpally and Tirumalgherry) was taken from ''Picket Lake'' (also known as Picket tank), and from a few other water bodies. Picket Lake was located at the entrance of the cantonment.  Picket lake was connected to [[Hussain Sagar|Hussainsagar]] through a channel. Gradually over the years the channel turned into a municipal drain. The lake was gradually encroached upon and later a [[Jubilee Bus Station|bus station]] was built in its location.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/picket-lake-consigned-to-history-now-jubilee-bus-station-stands-in-its-place/articleshow/72045220.cms|title=Picket lake consigned to history: Now, Jubilee bus station stands in its place|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|first=Syed|last=Akbar|date=2019-11-14|access-date=2024-10-14}}</ref>

The twin cities are separated by the man-made [[Hussain Sagar]] lake, which was built during the reign of the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]] in the 16th century. Unlike [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], the official language of Secunderabad was English.<ref name="Bridging two cultures"/> Secunderabad was exempted from customs duty on imported goods, thus making trade very profitable. Various new markets such as Regimental Bazaar and General Bazaar were created.

Post-Independence, the [[Secunderabad Cantonment Board]] came under the jurisdiction of the Indian Armed forces. Consequently, large military units were established. The popular neighbourhoods in Secunderabad are [[Tarnaka]], Paradise Circle, [[Trimulgherry]], Jawaharnagar colony, [[Marredpally]], Jeera, General Bazar, [[Sitaphalmandi]], [[Karkhana, Secunderabad|Kharkhana]], [[Rani Gunj|Ranigunj]], Yapral, Kowkur and New Bhoiguda.{{according to whom|date=October 2018|comment=Seems promotional of certain neighbourhoods over others, is this historically relevant?}} [[Begumpet Airport]] is close to Secunderabad and served the twin city until early 2008.

The camp transformed into an English town, and then into a truly cosmopolitan city where the Anglo-Indians, who had a colony popularly called “Little England”, rubbed shoulders with the Mudaliars of Tamil Nadu, the Rajasthani trading community, the Parsis, and the Sikhs, as the historian Narendra Luther book Laskar vividly captures the flavour in the chapter, “Colours of the rainbow”.
