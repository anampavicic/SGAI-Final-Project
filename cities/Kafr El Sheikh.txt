'''Kafr El Sheikh''' ({{langx|arz|كَفرُ الشَّيْخ}} {{IPA|arz|kɑfɾ eʃˈʃeːx|pron}}) is an Egyptian city and the capital of [[Kafr El Sheikh Governorate]], [[Egypt]], about 134&nbsp;km north of [[Cairo]], in the [[Nile Delta]] of lower Egypt. As of November 2006, the town had a population of around 500,000.<ref>[http://www.capmas.gov.eg/ ''Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics'', Egypten]. Accessed 11 November 2006.</ref>

Kafr El Sheikh was earlier known as '''Duminqun''' ({{Langx|ar|دُمِيْنقُون}}), but was officially named '''Fuadiyah''' or '''Fouadiyah''' ({{langx|ar|فُؤادِيَّة}}) in honour of [[King of Egypt|King]] [[Fuad I of Egypt]]. After the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|1952 Revolution]] and the subsequent abolition of the monarchy, the governorate took the name of its capital city Kafr El Sheikh. This name, adopted in 1955, means "the village of the chief".<ref>{{cite book |last=Room |first=Adrian |title=Placenames of the World: Origins and Meanings of the Names for 6,600 Countries, Cities, Territories, Natural Features, and Historic Sites |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&pg=PA185 |accessdate=2010-08-07 |edition=2nd |year=2006 |publisher=McFarland |location=Jefferson, NC |isbn=978-0-7864-2248-7 |page=185}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=الأسعد بن مماتي|title=قوانين الدواوين}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Carsten Peust|title=Die Toponyme vorarabischen Ursprungs im modernen Ägypten|year=2010|pages=56}}</ref> In 2006 the University of Kafr El Sheikh was established.

== Etymology ==
The modern name of the city means "village of the sheikh", and refers to sheikh Talhha at-Tilmisānī, who died here in 1234.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Die Toponyme vorarabischen Ursprungs im modernen Ägypten |publisher= |year=2010 |isbn= |location= |pages=56}}</ref> The older name of the city, '''Dumaynaqun''' ({{Langx|ar|دُمِيْنقُون}}), is reconstructed from [[Coptic language|Coptic]] by Engsheden as {{coptic|ⲑⲙⲟⲩⲓ}} ("''island''") + a personal name. This pattern is widely represented in Egyptian toponymy, so the name is expected to be Egyptian, but he proposes Nikon ({{Langx|grc|Νίκων}}), which is unattested in Coptic sources, unable to find a suitable Egyptian name.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Engsheden |first=Âke |title=Ancient Place-Names in the Governorate of Kafr el-Sheikh |publisher=Peeters |isbn=9789042941755 |pages=147}}</ref> In fact, a personal name ''Akon'' ({{Langx|cop|ⲁⲕⲱⲛ}}) is contained in place names like ''Pmounakon'' ({{Langx|cop|ⲡⲙⲟⲩⲛⲁⲕⲟⲛ|lit=the well of Akon}}) in the Hermopolite nome and ''Tmounakon'' ({{Langx|cop|ⲧⲙⲟⲩⲛⲁⲕⲱⲛ|lit=the island of Akon}}) near [[Oxyrhynchus]], the latter of which could share its etymology with Dumaynaqun.<ref>{{Cite web |title=TM Places |url=https://www.trismegistos.org/place/9619 |access-date=25 May 2023 |website=trismegistos.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Clackson |first=S.J. |title=Coptic documents relating to the monasteries of Apa Apollo at Bawit and Titkooh in the Hermopolite nome |publisher=University of London |page=68}}</ref>
