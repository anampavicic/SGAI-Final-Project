With a population of 161,265 as of 1 January 2014, Miskolc is the [[List of cities and towns in Hungary#Largest cities in Hungary|fourth largest city]] in Hungary (behind [[Budapest]], [[Debrecen]], and [[Szeged]]). It is also the county capital of [[Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén]] and the [[Regions of Hungary|regional]] centre of [[Northern Hungary]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén vármegye hivatalos honlapja |url=https://baz.hu/error.html |access-date=2024-03-12 |website=baz.hu}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name derives from ''Miško'', [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] form of [[Michael (given name)|Michael]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Tihányiová |last=Monika |title=Niekoľko poznámok k šľachtickému rodu Miškovcov |journal=Verbum Historiae |publisher=Univerzita Komenského |page=20 |year=2013 |issue=2| language=sk| issn=1339-4053 |url=https://www.fedu.uniba.sk/fileadmin/pdf/Sucasti/Katedry/KH/Verbum_Historiae/Verbum_Historiae_2-2013.pdf}}</ref><ref name="varsik">{{cite book |last=Varsik |first=Branislav |title=Osídlenie košickej kotliny III|location=Bratislava|page=415|publisher=Slovenská akadémia vied |year=1977 |language=sk}}</ref>  ''Miškovec'' → ''Miskolc''  with the same development as ''Lipovec'' → ''Lipólc'', ''Lipóc''. The name is associated with the [[Miskolc (genus)|Miskolc clan]] (also Miskóc or Myscouch, [[Slovak language|Slovak]] Miškovec, plural Miškovci) named after the settlement or vice versa. Earliest mentions are ''que nunc vocatur Miscoucy'' (around 1200), ''de Myschouch'' (1225), ''Ponyt de genere Myscouch'' (1230), ''in Miscovcy'' (1245).<ref name="varsik"/>

== Geography ==
[[File:Miskolc city hall square.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|250x250px|Miskolc City Hall Square]]
The city lies at the meeting point of different geographical regions – east of the [[Bükk]] mountains, in the valley of the river [[Sajó]] and the streams [[Hejő]] and [[Szinva]]. According to the [[2001 Census of Hungary|2001 Census]] the city has a total area of {{convert|236.68|km²|abbr=on}}. The ground level slopes gradually; the difference between the highest and lowest area is about {{convert|800|m|abbr=on}}.

The lowest areas are the banks of the river Sajó, with an altitude of {{convert|110|-|120|m|abbr=on}}. The area belongs to the [[Great Alföld|Great Plain]] region and is made up of sedimentary rocks. Between the [[Avas]] hill and [[Diósgyőr]] lies the hilly area of the ''Lower Bükk'' ({{convert|250|–|300|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}) consisting of sandstone, marl, clay, layers of coal, from the [[tertiary period]], and volcanic rocks from the [[Miocene]].

The ''Central Bükk'', a gently sloping mountainous area with an altitude between {{convert|400|and|600|m|abbr=on}}, is situated between Diósgyőr and [[Lillafüred]]; the area is made up of [[limestone]], [[slate]], [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] and other rocks from the [[Triassic]] period. The surface was formed mostly by karstic erosions.

The highest area, the {{convert|600|-|900|m|abbr=on}} high ''Higher Bükk''  bore ''Bükk Highlands'' begin at Lillafüred. This mostly consists of sea sediments (limestone, slate, dolomite) from the [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]], and volcanic rocks like [[diabase]] and [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]]. Several caves can be found in the area. The city is also known for the lowest temperature ever recorded in Hungary at{{convert|-35|°C|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="tempextremitiesinhungary">{{cite web| url = http://owww.met.hu/eghajlat/Magyarorszag/rekordok/homerseklet/| title = Eghajlat PAGE| access-date = 2013-05-11| publisher = Hungarian Meteorological Service |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130125131633/http://owww.met.hu/eghajlat/Magyarorszag/rekordok/homerseklet/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2013-01-25}}</ref>

===Climate===
Summers are fresh but sometimes warm and humid in Miskolc. Daytime temperatures of {{convert|20|-|30|C|F|0}}  or higher are commonplace. Snow and ice are dominant during the winter season. Miskolc receives about 120 centimetres of snowfall annually. Days below freezing and nights below {{convert|-20|°C|0}} both occur in the winter.

== History ==
[[File:Miskolc old picture.jpg|250px|thumb|Historical picture of the city. View from the [[Avas]] hill with the [[Gothic Protestant Church of Avas|Gothic church]] in the foreground. The church with two towers is the [[Minorite Church (Miskolc)|Minorite Church]] on today's [[Downtown (Miskolc)#Heroes' Square|Heroes' Square]].]]

The area has been inhabited since ancient times – archaeological findings date back to the [[Paleolithic]], proving human presence for over 70,000&nbsp;years {{Citation needed|reason=Need specific archaeological evidence to 'prove' the date of human presence.|date=January 2018}}. Its first known dwellers were the [[Cotini]], one of the [[Celt]] tribes. The area has been occupied by Hungarians since the "Conquest" in the late 9th&nbsp;century. It was first mentioned by this name around 1210 AD. The Miskóc clan lost their power when King [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles I]] centralized his power by curbing the power of the oligarchs.

Miskolc was elevated to the rank of [[oppidum]] (market town) in 1365 by King [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]]. He also had the [[Castle of Diósgyőr|castle]] of the nearby town [[Diósgyőr]] (now a district of Miskolc) transformed into a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[fortress]]. The city developed in a dynamic way, but during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation of most of Hungary the development of Miskolc was brought to a standstill. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] under [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] took Miskolc in 1544 and the city prospered further until 1687. It was also ruled by Ottomans after [[Battle of Mezőkeresztes]] in 1596 as part of [[Eyalet of Egir]] until 1687. It was during these years that Miskolc became an important centre of wine-growing. By the end of the 17th&nbsp;century the population of the city was as large as that of [[Košice|Kassa/Košice]], and 13&nbsp;guilds had been founded.

During the war of independence against [[Habsburg]] rule in the early 18th century, Prince [[Francis II Rákóczi]], the leader of the Hungarians put his headquarters in Miskolc. The imperial forces sacked and burnt the city in 1707. Four years later half of the population fell victim of a [[cholera]] epidemic. Miskolc recovered quickly, and another age of prosperity began again. In 1724, Miskolc was chosen to be the city where the county hall of [[Borsod]] county would be built. Many other significant buildings were built in the 18th and 19th&nbsp;centuries, including the [[city hall]], schools such as [[Lévay József Református Gimnázium és Diákotthon]], [[Church (building)|churches]], the [[Synagogue of Miskolc|synagogue]], and the [[National Theatre of Miskolc|theatre]]. The theatre is commonly regarded as the first stone-built theatre of Hungary, although the first one was actually built in Kolozsvár (then a part of Hungary, now [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Romania]]). According to the first nationally held census (1786) the city had a population of 14,719, and 2,414&nbsp;houses.
[[File:Miskolc Erzsébet Spa.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Elizabeth Square]]

These years brought prosperity, but the cholera epidemic of 1873 and the [[Flood in Miskolc, 1878|flood of 1878]] took many lives. Several buildings were destroyed by the flood, but bigger and grander buildings were built in their places. [[World War I]] did not affect the city directly, but many people died, either from warfare or from the cholera epidemic. It was occupied by [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] troops between 1918 and 1919 after the [[First World War]].

After the [[Treaty of Trianon]], Hungary lost [[Košice|Kassa]] (today Košice, Slovakia) and Miskolc became the sole regional center of northern Hungary. This was one of the reasons for the enormous growth of the city during the 1930s and 1940s.

Early in World War II Hungary became an ally of Nazi Germany. Unhappy with the Hungarian government, German troops occupied Hungary on March 19, 1944 and put the anti-semitic [[Arrow Cross Party]] in charge of the government. Jews in Miskolc and elsewhere were ordered to wear yellow stars on their clothing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/miskolc/holocaust.html|title=Holocaust|last=Kenvin|first=Helene|website=kehilalinks.jewishgen.org|access-date=2016-10-20}}</ref> Under the supervision of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-''[[Obersturmbannführer]]'' [[Adolf Eichmann]]'','' "deportations" from Miskolc began on June 11 or 12th, 1944. Over 14,000 Jewish adults and children were sent by cattle car to Auschwitz, where most were gassed on arrival. After the war Jews who survived the holocaust returned to Miskolc hoping to reclaim their land and possessions.  Over 130 were rounded up by members of the local Arrow Cross Party and summarily murdered. The Jewish cemetery on a hill overlooking Miskolc<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iajgsjewishcemeteryproject.org/hungary/miskolc.html|title=MISKOLC: BAZ {{!}} Hungary – International Jewish Cemetery Project|website=www.iajgsjewishcemeteryproject.org|access-date=2016-10-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003191135/http://www.iajgsjewishcemeteryproject.org/hungary/miskolc.html|archive-date=2018-10-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>  has a memorial for them.  It includes the 10 commandments, carved in stone, all written in Hebrew except ''Thou shall not kill,'' which is written in Hungarian.

The preparation for [[World War II]] established Miskolc as the national centre of heavy industry, a position the city maintained until the 1990s. Although Miskolc suffered a lot during the last year of the war, it recovered quickly, and by absorbing the surrounding villages, it became the second-largest city of Hungary with more than 200,000 inhabitants.

On July 30 and August 1, 1946, the [[Miskolc pogrom]] led to death of one accused [[Jewish]] [[black market]]eer, the wounding of another, and subsequently the death of a Jewish policeman. Economic hardship and [[anti-Semitism]] motivated the riots.

In 1949, the [[University of Miskolc]] was founded (as a successor of the ''Academy of Mining'', formerly in Selmecbánya, which is now [[Banská Štiavnica]], Slovakia).
[[File:BorsodCountyHall-2.jpg|thumb|180px|County hall of Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén on City Hall square]]

During its long history Miskolc survived fires, floods, plagues and foreign invasions, but maintained its position as the centre of northeastern Hungary. The 1990s brought a crisis in the iron industry with a decline in the population.

Miskolc is now trying to become known as a cultural – instead of merely an industrial – city. Among the various cultural events, one of the most important festivities is the [[Miskolc Opera Festival|International Opera Festival]], held every summer.

Tourist destinations in Miskolc include [[Miskolctapolca|Tapolca]], [[Lillafüred]] and Felsőhámor. Tapolca has a park with a boating pond and the unique [[Cave Bath]]. Lillafüred and Felsőhámor are pretty villages in a valley surrounded by mountains and forests; their sights include the Hotel Palace on the shore of the Lake Hámori, the Szinva waterfall (the highest waterfall of the country), the Anna Cave and the István Cave.

Miskolc is generally thought of as an industrial city, and the largest boost to its economy was indeed provided by the industrialization during the Socialist era; in fact industry (including metallurgy) has a long history in the city.

Miskolc was already an important market town in the Middle Ages, mostly due to its proximity to the main trade routes of the region. In regards of the economy, real development started only after the Ottoman occupation. In the 18th&nbsp;century, the town already had a lumber mill, a paper manufacture, a brewery, a gunpowder factory and fifteen mills on the Szinva stream. The [[glassblowing|glass works]] manufactures and [[iron furnaces]] appeared in the late 18th and early 19th&nbsp;centuries. The first iron furnace, built by [[Henrik Fazola]] around 1770, did not survive, but the second one, built in 1813, can still be visited. Several new settlements were formed in the Bükk mountains to provide dwellings for the workers of glass works manufactures and furnaces. Many of them – including Alsóhámor, Felsőhámor, Ómassa and [[Bükkszentlászló]] – are now parts of Miskolc.

Development quickened from the second half of the 19th&nbsp;century, partly because of the political situation (after the [[Ausgleich]]) and partly because of the newly constructed railway line. A large furnace (second largest in the country) was built in Diósgyőr, and several other factories were built. The mining industry became more and more important, too. Within forty years the population doubled. The industrialization led to the forming of ''Greater Miskolc'' with the unification of Miskolc and Diósgyőr (1945) and several nearby towns and villages (between 1950 and 1981). The unification was only the first step in Miskolc being developed into an industrial centre. Development reached its highest point in the 1980s, when the metal factory had more than 18,000 workers and production was over one million tons per year. The population hit all-time record (over 200,000 inhabitants), ⅔ of the working people worked in heavy industry.

The economic recession after the end of the Socialist era hit the industrial cities of Northern Hungary the hardest. The [[unemployment]] rate rose until it became one of the highest in the country, the population of Miskolc dramatically decreased (not only because of unemployment though, but also due to [[suburbanization]] which became prevalent nationwide). The economic situation of the city went through a change, smaller enterprises appeared in place of the large state-owned companies.

By the early 2000s the decade of changes was over, and the city went through the recession successfully. International companies and [[supermarket]]s appeared in the area. The local government is trying to strengthen the city's role in culture and tourism. By the end of 2004, the [[highway]] M3 had reached the city.

== Sports ==
The most popular sport in Miskolc is [[association football|football]]. The leading club of the city is [[Diósgyőri VTK]]<ref>[http://www.dvtk.eu Diósgyőri VTK website]</ref> (short name: DVTK). They have won the [[Hungarian Cup]] several times and represented Hungary many times in Europe. The capacity of the stadium, [[DVTK Stadion]], is 14 655 and the stadium has under-soil heating and fully covered stands.

The other team, [[Miskolci VSC]], plays in the county division. Miskolc has got other former first division representatives, namely [[Miskolci AK|Miskolci Attila]] (seven seasons at the highest level), and [[Perecesi TK]] (one).

=== Football teams ===
*[[Diósgyőri VTK]]
*[[Miskolci VSC]]
*[[Miskolci AK]]

The women's volleyball team of [[MVSC (volleyball)|MVSC]] also plays at the highest Hungarian level.

Former motorcycle speedway team [[Speedway Miskolc]] (8 times champions of Hungary) joined the [[Team Speedway Polish Championship]] from 2006 to 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyspeedway.nstrefa.pl/druzynowemp.php |title=Historical results 1948-2013 |website=Speedway History |access-date=30 December 2022}}</ref> They won the [[2007 European Speedway Club Champions' Cup]] with world champion [[Jason Crump]].

== City parts of Miskolc ==

=== Avas ===
[[File:Avasi Belltower.jpg|thumb|180px|Belfry of the [[Gothic Protestant Church of Avas|Gothic church]]]]
[[File:Diosgyor castle and king louis.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Castle of Diósgyőr|Diósgyőr Castle]] ruins]]
[[File:Deszkatemplom Miskolc.jpg|thumb|180px|Wooden Church]]
The [[Avas]] is a hill ({{convert|234|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}) in the heart of Miskolc. On the hilltop stands the Avas lookout tower, the symbol of the city. On the northern part of the hill, close to downtown Erzsébet Square, is the [[Gothic Protestant Church of Avas]], one of the two oldest buildings of Miskolc (the other is the [[Castle of Diósgyőr]].) The limestone caves of Avas are used as wine cellars; the narrow, winding streets give a Mediterranean atmosphere to this part of Avas Hill. The southern part of Avas, also called Avas-South, is where the largest housing estate of the city stands, with 10-story Socialist-style concrete buildings providing homes for about one-third of the city's population.

=== Belváros (City centre) ===
Miskolc's city centre is not as rich in monuments as that of other cities; only the Main Street (Széchenyi St.), ''Városház tér'' (City Hall Square) and ''Erzsébet tér'' (Elizabeth Square) have preserved the 19th-century style of the town. There are not only historical buildings but also modern shopping malls and offices in the city centre.

=== Diósgyőr ===
[[Diósgyőr|The other town]] forming today's Greater Miskolc is mostly famous for its medieval [[Castle of Diósgyőr|castle]]. Miskolc's football team also got its name from Diósgyőr, since their stadium stands there. Historical Diósgyőr is connected to Historical Miskolc by a district called ''Új(diós)győr'' (Újgyőr); its main square is an important traffic hub. Also in Új(diós)győr ''(Diósgyőr-Vasgyár)'' stands the steel factory that made Miskolc the most important heavy industrial city of Hungary (and earned it the nickname "Steel City"). [[Diósgyőri Gimnázium]] also stands in this district.

=== Egyetemváros (University Town) ===
The [[University of Miskolc]] is among the newer ones. It was founded in the 1950s, so its buildings are not old, historical ones. [[University Town (Miskolc)|University Town]] is one of the newer parts of the city and can be found between Miskolc and the holiday resort Miskolctapolca. The university, the campus, and the sport facilities are surrounded by a large park.

=== Hejőcsaba and Görömböly ===
Two former villages that were annexed to the city in 1945 and 1950. [[Görömböly]] still looks like a small town of its own.

=== Lillafüred ===
Another holiday resort, [[Lillafüred|Miskolc-Lillafüred]], is a village surrounded by the Bükk mountains. Its most notable building is the Palace Hotel (Palotaszálló).

=== Martin-Kertváros ===
[[Martin-Kertváros]] (in Slovak: Martinská osada) is a suburban area.

=== Miskolctapolca ===
One of the most well-known holiday resorts in the country, Tapolca (officially [[Miskolctapolca]] or Miskolc-Tapolca to avoid confusion with the Transdanubian town of the same name) is the home of the unique [[Cave Bath of Miskolc|Cave Bath]], a natural cave with thermal water. Tapolca is quite far from the city centre and counts as one of the posh areas of Miskolc. It is a popular tourist attraction.

=== Alsóhámor, Bükkszentlászló, Felsőhámor, Ómassa, Szirma ===
These former villages were annexed to the city in 1950 ([[Bükkszentlászló]] in 1981) and are still separated villages, connected to the city only by its [[MVK Rt.|public transport system]].
