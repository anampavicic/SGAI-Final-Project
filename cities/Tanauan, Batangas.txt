'''Tanauan''', officially the '''City of Tanauan''' ({{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Tanauan}}), is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Batangas]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 193,936 people.{{PH census|current}}

It is incorporated as a city under [[Republic Act]] No. 9005, signed on February 2, 2001, and ratified on March 10, 2001.

The city is part of [[Mega Manila]] resulting from the continuous expansion of [[Metro Manila]]. It shares its borders with [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], to the north, [[Tagaytay|Tagaytay City]], [[Cavite]], to the northwest, [[Talisay, Batangas|Talisay]] to the west, [[Santo Tomas, Batangas|Santo Tomas City]] to the east, and the towns of [[Balete, Batangas|Balete]] and [[Malvar, Batangas|Malvar]] to the south. It borders on [[Taal Lake]] to the west. The town is known for the [[Old Tanauan Church Ruins]], the most important archaeological site in the municipality where human remains from the colonial era have been unearthed.

Among those born in Tanauan are revolutionary former Prime Minister [[Apolinario Mabini]] and former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[José P. Laurel]].

== Etymology ==
The name "Tanauan" may have come from:
* the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word ''tanaw'', which means "to look through [the window]," as it was the site of a lookout tower that provides a view of the [[Pansipit River]] on the other side of [[Taal Lake]] and of the surrounding lands; or
* ''tanawa'', a shrub that flourished in the area and on the shoreline of Taal Lake, according to the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]].<ref name=hist />
Like most Batangueños,Tanauan residents also pronounce the city's name as '''Tan-awan''', in [[Batangas Tagalog]] dialect, despite the spelling. It is also spelled as '''Tanawan'''. 

== History ==
[[File:Philippine Island - Luzon Island - NARA - 68157097.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Tanauan, 1941]]
Tanauan was founded by the [[Augustinians]] in 1584 on the northwestern bay of Taal Lake (formerly Bombon Lake), called Tanauan Bay. Lookout towers were associated with 16th and 17th century churches to forewarn of [[Moro people|Moro]] raids. "Old Tanauan" ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''Lumang Tanauan'') included such lookout tower and associated ''sapao'' (built-up structures in the water). The 1754 eruption of [[Taal Volcano]] forced the town inhabitants to initially move to Sala. Subsequently, both towns moved again later that year to Tanauan's current location, in which Sala is now a [[barrio]].<ref name="Thomas">{{cite book |last1=Hargrove |first1=Thomas |title=The Mysteries of Taal: A Philippine volcano and lake, her sea life and lost towns |date=1991 |publisher=Bookmark Publishing |location=Manila |isbn=9715690467 |pages=13, 33–55}}</ref>

Tanaueños have displayed characteristics of personal independence and nationalism since early history. The town is called the cradle of noble heroes due to its contribution to the revolutionary movement of its sons Apolinario Mabini, the brains of Katipunan, and later by the statesman José P. Laurel. Also, three Tanaueños served as governors of Batangas, namely: José P. Laurel V, Modesto Castillo and Nicolas Gonzales.<ref name=hist>{{cite web|url=https://tanauancity.gov.ph/history|title=A Brief History of our City|website=Tanauan City Government|access-date=July 5, 2023}}</ref>

From 1903 to 1906, during the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American occupation]], it was consolidated with the municipality of [[Talisay, Batangas|Talisay]] and became the seat of the municipal government.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=708|date=March 28, 1903|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%20708|title=An Act Reducing Thirteen of the Municipalities in the Province of Batangas to Five|accessdate=July 5, 2023|publisher=Senate of the Philippines Legislative Digital Resources}}</ref><ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=1514|date=July 23, 1906|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%201514|title=An Act Increasing the Number of Municipalities in the Province of Batangas From Fifteen to Sixteen, by Separating From Tanauan the Former Municipality of Talisay, Reconstituting the Latter as a Municipality, and Giving to Each the Territory Which It Comprised Prior to the Passage of Act Numbered Seven Hundred and Eight|accessdate=July 5, 2023|publisher=Senate of the Philippines Legislative Digital Resources}}</ref> In 1904, the barrios of Balaquilong (Balakilong), Bayuyungan, Binirayan (Berinayan), Bugaan, and San Gabriel were ceded to [[Taal, Batangas|Taal]] by virtue of Act No. 1244;<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=1244|date=October 7, 1904|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%201244|title=An Act Annexing the Barrios of Bayuyungan, Bugaan, Balaquilong, San Gabriel, and Binirayan, Now a Part of the Municipality of Tanauan, Province of Batangas, to the Municipality of Taal, in the Same Province|accessdate=July 5, 2023|publisher=Senate of the Philippines Legislative Digital Resources}}</ref> these barrios would eventually be returned to Talisay and later form the present-day [[Laurel, Batangas|Laurel]].<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=RA|number=5689|title=An Act Creating the Municipality of Laurel in the Province of Batangas|url=https://thecorpusjuris.com/legislative/republic-acts/ra-no-5689.php|date=June 21, 1969|accessdate=July 3, 2023|publisher=The Corpus Juris}}</ref>

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
The [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] approved Batangas 3rd District Representative Jose Macario Laurel IV's bill and a Senate counterpart measure to convert the municipality of Tanauan into a city on December 19, 2000. Republic Act No. 9005, known as "The Charter of the City of Tanauan," was signed into law on February 2, 2001 by President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]].

On March 10, 2001, a Saturday, the charter was approved by a referendum in Tanauan that drew 8,890 or 16% of the 55,453 registered voters. Two ballots were either spoiled or blank. The "yes" had it over the "no" by a landslide, 7,026 to 1,961.

According to cityhood advocates, quoted in reports reaching Batangas on Sunday, the turnout, despite being two times better than previous conversion-to-city exercises, was still only 16%.<ref name=geo>{{cite web |title=Batangan: Tanauan backs into cityhood; House panel okays "jueteng" bill; Laurel drops plan for Santo Tomas cityhood |url=http://www.geocities.ws/batangan2002/nation/congress/cario.htm |website=www.geocities.ws |access-date=July 2, 2018}}</ref>
