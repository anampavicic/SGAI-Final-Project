It is located on the [[Acushnet River]] in what is known as the [[South Coast (Massachusetts)|South Coast]] region. It is the largest city in the region and second largest city in the Providence Metropolitan Region. Up through the 17th century, the area was the territory of the [[Wampanoag]] Indians. English colonists bought the land on which New Bedford would later be built from the Wampanoag in 1652, and the original colonial settlement that would later become the city was founded by English [[Quakers]] in the late 17th century. The town of New Bedford itself was officially incorporated in 1787.

During the first half of the 19th century, New Bedford was one of the world's most important [[whaling]] ports.<ref name=BBC18>{{cite news |last1=MacEacheran |first1=Mike |title=The city that lit the world |url=https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20180719-the-city-that-lit-the-world |access-date=September 22, 2021 |work=BBC Travel |date=July 20, 2018 |archive-date=September 22, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210922124821/https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20180719-the-city-that-lit-the-world |url-status=live }}</ref> At its economic height during this period, New Bedford was the wealthiest city in North America per capita.

Before the 17th century, the lands along the [[Acushnet River]] were inhabited by the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] Native Americans, who had settlements throughout southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island, including [[Martha's Vineyard]] and [[Nantucket, Massachusetts|Nantucket]]. Their population is believed to have been about 12,000.

At first, the Old Dartmouth territory was devoid of major town centers, and instead had isolated farms and small, decentralized villages, such as [[Russells Mills Village Historic District|Russells' Mills]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Old Dartmouth Purchase|url=https://www.whalingmuseum.org/explore/exhibitions/harboring-hope-in-old-dartmouth/old-dartmouth-purchase|access-date=February 3, 2020|website=New Bedford Whaling Museum|language=en|archive-date=February 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203160505/https://www.whalingmuseum.org/explore/exhibitions/harboring-hope-in-old-dartmouth/old-dartmouth-purchase|url-status=dead}}</ref> One reason for this is that the inhabitants enjoyed their independence from the Plymouth Colony and they did not want the Plymouth court to appoint them a minister.<ref name=":6" />

At this time, the economy primarily ran on agriculture and fishing. The availability of land attracted many Quakers and [[Baptists]] from [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] and [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]] in [[Rhode Island]], as well as more waves of Puritan migration.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

==== King Philip's War ====

=== New Bedford ===
A section of Old Dartmouth near the west bank of the Acushnet River, originally called Bedford Village, was officially incorporated as the [[New England town|town]] of New Bedford on February 23, 1787, after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The name was suggested by the Russell family, who were prominent citizens of the community. The [[Dukes of Bedford]], a leading English aristocratic house, also bore the surname Russell. ([[Bedford, Massachusetts]], had been incorporated in 1729; hence "New" Bedford.)

The late 18th century was a time of growth for the town. A small whale fishery developed, as well as modest international trade. In the 1760s, between the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[American Revolution]], shipwrights, carpenters, mechanics, and blacksmiths, settled around New Bedford harbor, creating a skilled and comprehensive maritime community.

New Bedford's first newspaper, ''The Medley'' (also known as the ''New Bedford Marine Journal''), was founded in 1792.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83020640/|title=The Medley, or, Newbedford marine journal|via=chroniclingamerica.loc.gov|access-date=March 4, 2013|archive-date=July 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713045121/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83020640/|url-status=live}}</ref> On June 12, 1792, the town set up its first post office. William Tobey was its first postmaster. The construction of a bridge (originally a toll bridge) between New Bedford and present-day Fairhaven in 1796 also spurred growth. (Fairhaven separated from New Bedford in 1812, forming an independent town that included both present-day Fairhaven and present-day Acushnet.)

=== Whaling City ===
Nantucket had been the dominant whaling port, though the industry was controlled by a cartel of merchants in Boston, Newport, and Providence. In the 1760s, Nantucket's most prominent whaling families moved to New Bedford, refining their own oil and making their own premium candles.

The [[American Revolutionary War]] completely paralyzed the whaling industry. [[List of British units in the American Revolutionary War|British forces]] blockaded American ports and captured or destroyed American commercial ships; they even [[Grey's raid|marched down King's Street]] in New Bedford (defiantly renamed Union Street after the Revolution) and set businesses on fire. 
[[File:Lowering Boats 01.jpg|thumb|''Lowering Boats'' by [[Clifford Warren Ashley]], held at the [[New Bedford Whaling Museum]].]]
[[Nantucket during the American Revolutionary War era|Nantucket]] was even more exposed, and the physical destruction, frozen economy, and import taxes imposed after the war obliterated previous fortunes. New Bedford also had a deeper harbor and was located on the mainland. As a result, New Bedford supplanted Nantucket as the nation's preeminent [[whaling]] port, and so began the Golden Age of Whaling. [[Nantucket during the American Revolutionary War era|William Rotch]] (owner of the ''Dartmouth'' of the [[Boston Tea Party]]) and Samuel Rodman were important Quaker businessmen in the whaling industry.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Crabtree|first=Sarah|title=Before the Rockefellers, there were the Rotches, Part 1 of 13|url=https://nha.org/research/nantucket-history/history-topics/before-the-rockefellers-there-were-the-rotches/|access-date=August 23, 2021|website=Nantucket Historical Association|language=en-US|archive-date=August 23, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210823160316/https://nha.org/research/nantucket-history/history-topics/before-the-rockefellers-there-were-the-rotches/|url-status=live}}</ref>

After the [[War of 1812]]'s embargo was lifted, New Bedford started amassing a number of colossal, sturdy, square-rigged whaling ships, many of them built at the shipyard of [[Mattapoisett, Massachusetts|Mattapoisett]]. The invention of on-board [[trywork]]s, a system of massive iron pots over a brick furnace, allowed the whalers to render high quality oil from the blubber.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/nebe/learn/historyculture/whalehunt.htm|title=Whale Hunt - New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)|last1=Bedford|first1=Mailing Address: 33 William Street New|last2=Us|first2=MA 02740 Phone: 508-996-4095 Contact|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|access-date=February 3, 2020|archive-date=February 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203165258/https://www.nps.gov/nebe/learn/historyculture/whalehunt.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> This allowed the whaling ships to go out to sea for as long as four years, processing their catch while at sea.<ref name=":0" /> Ships from New Bedford came back to port with [[Whale oil|barrels of oil]], [[spermaceti]], and occasionally [[ambergris]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/nebe/learn/historyculture/whaleproducts.htm|title=Whale Products {{!}} Whaling - New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)|last1=Bedford|first1=Mailing Address: 33 William Street New|last2=Us|first2=MA 02740 Phone: 508-996-4095 Contact|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|access-date=February 3, 2020|archive-date=February 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203165259/https://www.nps.gov/nebe/learn/historyculture/whaleproducts.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

Whaling dominated New Bedford's economy for much of the century, and many families of the city were involved with it as crew and officers of ships. The Quakers remained prominent and influential in New Bedford throughout the whaling era. They brought religious values into their business models, promoting stability as well as prosperity, investing in infrastructure projects such as rail, and employing [[Equal opportunity|without discrimination]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whalingmuseum.org/learn/research-topics/cultural-communities|title=Cultural Communities and Identities|website=New Bedford Whaling Museum|language=en|access-date=February 3, 2020|archive-date=February 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203163809/https://www.whalingmuseum.org/learn/research-topics/cultural-communities|url-status=dead}}</ref> They established solid social and economic relationships with [[Boston]], [[New York City|New York]], and [[Philadelphia]], integrating New Bedford into the [[Northeast megalopolis|urban northeastern economy]].

Ten thousand men worked in the whaling industry. During this period, New Bedford's population increased from approximately 4,000 in 1820 to about 24,000 in 1860.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=DeWitt|first=John|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-Ml4U5EkxsC&pg=PA66|title=Early Globalization and the Economic Development of the United States and Brazil|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-97199-1|language=en|access-date=June 26, 2020|archive-date=February 15, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230215201352/https://books.google.com/books?id=3-Ml4U5EkxsC&pg=PA66|url-status=live}}</ref> At the height of the whaling industry in 1857, the harbor hosted 329 vessels worth over $12&nbsp;million, and New Bedford became the [[Per capita income|richest city per capita]] in North America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180719-the-city-that-lit-the-world|title=The city that lit the world|last=MacEacheran|first=Mike|website=www.bbc.com|language=en|access-date=February 3, 2020|archive-date=February 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221013926/http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180719-the-city-that-lit-the-world|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Whaling decline ===
The whaling industry went into decline after the [[Pennsylvania oil rush|1859 discovery of petroleum]] in Pennsylvania. Each decade thenceforth saw a gradual decrease in whaling work, activity, and revenue. During the Civil War, the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] engaged in [[commerce raiding]] with ships such as the [[CSS Alabama|''Alabama'']], the [[CSS Florida (cruiser)|''Florida'']], and the [[CSS Shenandoah|''Shenandoah'']], trying to attack the [[Whaling in the United States|Yankee whaling industry]] and sabotage the US economy.<ref name="Yankee Whaling">{{Cite web|url=https://www.whalingmuseum.org/learn/research-topics/overview-of-north-american-whaling/american-whaling|title=Yankee Whaling|website=New Bedford Whaling Museum|language=en|access-date=February 15, 2020|archive-date=February 15, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215013609/https://www.whalingmuseum.org/learn/research-topics/overview-of-north-american-whaling/american-whaling|url-status=live}}</ref> Additionally, the US federal government bought several inactive [[whaler]]s, filled them with stones, sand, and dirt, and towed them to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], South Carolina, where the [[Union Navy]] sank what became known as the [[Stone Fleet]] in an unsuccessful attempt to blockade the Confederate bay.<ref name="Yankee Whaling"/> Along with the poor business and low whale populations, this dealt a potent blow to a failing industry.

=== Textile industry ===

[[File:Massachusetts - New Bedford - NARA - 23941315 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|New Bedford Cotton Mill in 1923]]
In the midst of this decline, greater New Bedford's economy became more dependent on the [[textile industry]], which began to eclipse the whaling industry in the late 19th century. The mills grew and expanded constantly, eventually comprising multiple sites along the [[Acushnet River]]. In 1875 alone, the [[Wamsutta Mills]] processed 19,000 bales of cotton into 20&nbsp;million yards of cloth, which had a wholesale value comparable to that of the entire whaling catch, and continued to produce over 20&nbsp;million yards of cloth yearly after 1883.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hough|first=Henry Beetle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzcEAAAAMAAJ&q=19,000+wamsutta+mills|title=Wamsutta of New Bedford, 1846-1946: A Story of New England Enterprise|date=1946|publisher=Wamsutta Mills|language=en|access-date=June 26, 2020|archive-date=February 15, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230215201421/https://books.google.com/books?id=BzcEAAAAMAAJ&q=19,000+wamsutta+mills|url-status=live}}</ref> The Wamsutta Mills remained the world's largest weaving plant until 1892.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.historic-structures.com/ma/new_bedford/wamsutta_mill.php|title=Wamsutta Mill, New Bedford Massachusetts|work=Historic Structures|access-date=February 15, 2020|archive-date=January 10, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200110050538/http://www.historic-structures.com/ma/new_bedford/wamsutta_mill.php|url-status=live}}</ref>

The textile mills redefined wealth in New Bedford, and gave birth to a prosperity greater than that of the whaling industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whalingmuseum.org/programs/migration-and-mill-work-2017/|title=Migration and Mill Work|website=New Bedford Whaling Museum|language=en|access-date=February 15, 2020|archive-date=February 15, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215014748/https://www.whalingmuseum.org/programs/migration-and-mill-work-2017/|url-status=dead}}</ref> New Bedford, funded by industrial fortunes, developed a thriving art scene. The [[Pairpoint Glass|Mount Washington Glass Company]] (which later became [[Pairpoint Glass|Pairpoint]]) crafted works of glass and silver for the newly affluent class, and examples of these works can be seen today on the second floor of the [[New Bedford Whaling Museum]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

In the 1920s, local employers came under competitive pressure from new textile factories in the low-wage South.<ref name="Foner10-165">Foner, Philip S. (1994) ''History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Volume 10,'' New York, International Publishers pp. 164-165.</ref> In April 1928 their demand for a 10 percent across the board [[1928 New Bedford textile strike|cut in wages was met with strike action]]. After considerable controversy control of the large-scale work stoppage passed from the [[Communist Party USA|Communist-led]] Textile Mill Committee (TMC) to sundry [[craft union]]s affiliated with the [[American Federation of Labor]] who, agreeing to a five percent wage cut, ended the strike in October.<ref name="Foner10-165" /> Wage reductions were not enough to arrest the long-term competitive decline of the local textile industry.

===Immigration===
Until 1800, New Bedford and its surrounding communities were, by and large, populated by Protestants of English, Scottish, Welsh, and Dutch origin. During the first half of the 19th century many Irish people came to Massachusetts. In 1818, Irish immigrants established the Catholic mission that built St. Mary's Church. Later in that century, immigrants from [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] and its colonial possessions in the Atlantic—[[Cape Verde]], the [[Azores]], and [[Madeira]]—began arriving in New Bedford and the surrounding area, attracted by jobs in the whaling industry; many had family members who had worked on whaling ships. As the [[Luso-American|Portuguese community]] began to increase in population, it established the first Portuguese parish in the city, [[St. John the Baptist Church (New Bedford, Massachusetts)|St. John the Baptist]] (1871). French Canadians also secured a foothold in New Bedford at about the same time, and they built the Church of the Sacred Heart in 1877.

[[File:PurchaseStreetNewBedfordMA.jpg|thumb|North Congregational Church, Purchase Street, 1906]]Similarly, [[Polish Americans|Polish immigrants]] began arriving in the late 19th century and established the parish of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in 1903. A number of [[History of the Jews in the United States|Jewish]] families, arriving in the late 19th century, were active in the whaling industry, selling provisions and outfitting ships. During the years leading up to the [[World War I|First World War]], a sizable eastern-European Jewish community joined them in New Bedford. Some became prominent merchants and businessmen, mainly in textiles and manufacturing.

===Modern history===

[[File:New Bedford, Massachusetts-view of harbor.jpeg|thumb|View of boats docked at New Bedford]]
Fishing and manufacturing continue to be two of the largest businesses in the area, and healthcare has become a major employer. The three largest single employers based in New Bedford are [[Southcoast Hospitals Group]], one of the top ten employers in Massachusetts (healthcare), [[Titleist]] (golf clubs, balls, apparel, manufacturing), and Riverside Manufacturing (apparel manufacturing).

According to a 2001 study by the [[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth]] Center for Policy Analysis, the three largest employment sectors in the Greater New Bedford area (the area includes New Bedford and Acushnet, Dartmouth, Fairhaven, Freetown, Lakeville, Marion, Mattapoisett, Rochester, and Wareham) were as follows: services (26% of total employment); wholesale trade (22%); manufacturing (19%). The largest industries by employment in the area were as follows: health services, eating and drinking places, wholesale trade, food stores, and social services.

In 2002, the city received $61,194,358 in taxation revenue, $44,536,201 in local receipts, and $12,044,152 classified as ''other available''.

In 2005 the unemployment rate was 7.3%, having dropped throughout the 1990s from 12.5% to 5.3% in 2000, and then having risen to 10.4% in 2003.  By 2009, in the midst of the economic crisis of the era, the unemployment rate got as high as 12.4%.

In 2005, the city received $104,925,772 for education, and $22,755,439 for general government from the [[Massachusetts|State of Massachusetts]].

In 2016, the city hopes its proximity to Massachusetts' southern coastline will allow it to become a center for the growing [[Wind power|wind energy]] market. Three companies, OffshoreMW, [[Deepwater Wind]], and [[DONG Energy]], have leased portions of New Bedford's Marine Commerce Terminal for the staging of turbines and platforms.<ref>{{cite news|last=Associated|first=Press|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/business/business_markets/2016/09/offshore_wind_firms_agree_to_use_new_bedford_terminal|title=Offshore wind firms agree to use New Bedford terminal|date=September 6, 2016|work=[[Boston Herald]]|access-date=September 7, 2016|archive-date=September 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160907141805/http://www.bostonherald.com/business/business_markets/2016/09/offshore_wind_firms_agree_to_use_new_bedford_terminal|url-status=live}}</ref>

From New Bedford's northern border with Freetown to the Buzzards Bay coast at Clark's Point the distance is approximately {{convert|14|mi}}.  Across New Bedford east to west is a distance of about {{convert|2|mi}}. The highest point in the city is an unnamed hill crossed by [[Interstate 195 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 195]] and Hathaway Road west of downtown, with an elevation greater than {{convert|180|ft}} above sea level.<ref>U.S. Geological Survey ''New Bedford North, MA'' 7.5-minute quadrangle, 1979.</ref>

The [[Port of New Bedford]], also known as New Bedford Harbor, a body of water shared with Fairhaven, is actually the estuary of the [[Acushnet River]] where it empties into Buzzards Bay.  The river empties into the bay beyond Clark's Point, the southernmost point of the city.  To the west of Clark's Point is Clark's Cove, which extends landward approximately one and one-half miles from the bay.  Just south of Palmer's Island, beginning near Fort Phoenix in Fairhaven, lies a two-mile-long hurricane barrier, constructed in the 1960s to protect the inner harbor where the fishing fleet anchors.  Along with Palmer's Island, the city also lays claim to [[Fish Island, Massachusetts|Fish Island]] and [[Pope's Island]].  Between these two islands lies one of the three sections, the central section, of the New Bedford-Fairhaven Bridge.  The central span, a swing bridge, connects the two islands as well as allowing boats and ships passage to the upper harbor.  Two conventional bridges connect each of the islands to the nearest mainland, Fish Island to New Bedford and Pope's Island to Fairhaven.  In addition to the harbor, there are several small brooks and ponds within the city limits.

==Economy==

===Early history===
[[File:New Bedford, Massachusetts-old harbor.jpeg|thumb|View of historic New Bedford harbor]]
[[File:Temple type toggle harpoon, c. 1840s to 1920s, iron, hemp rope twine lanyard - San Francisco Maritime Museum - San Francisco, CA - DSC04089.jpg | thumb | The Temple toggle harpoon]]

The economy of the Pilgrim settlement in the New Bedford area was initially based around a few farming and fishing villages. The early Bedford Village quickly became a commercial zone and from there became a major [[whaling]] and foreign trade port. In the early 18th century, the Russell family purchased this area and developed it into a larger village (Joseph Russell III having made the most significant contributions). Age of Sail ships built in New Bedford include the schooner ''[[Caroline (schooner)|Caroline]]'' and whaleship ''[[Charles W. Morgan (ship)|Charles W. Morgan]]''. By the 18th century, entrepreneurs in the area, such as whaling merchants from Nantucket, were attracted to the village and helped make it into one of the top whaling cities in the country. The most significant of these merchants was [[Joseph Rotch]], who bought ten acres (four hectares) of land in 1765 from Joseph Russell III on which he and his sons ran the family business. Rotch moved his business to New Bedford since it would be better for refining whale oil and manufacturing candles made from whales. As these parts of the whaling industry had been monopolized by a merchant cartel in Boston, [[Newport, Rhode Island]], and Providence, Rhode Island, Rotch felt that it would be better for business to handle these himself by moving to the mainland.

The relationship between New Bedford and Nantucket allowed the two cities to dominate the whaling industry. In 1848 New Bedford resident [[Lewis Temple]] invented the [[toggling harpoon]], an invention that revolutionized the whaling industry and helped make New Bedford its preeminent American city. Another factor was the increased draft of whaling ships, in part the result of greater use of steel in their construction, which made them too deep for Nantucket harbor. [[Syren (clipper)|''Syren'']], the longest lived of the clipper ships, spent over a decade transporting [[whale oil]] and whaling products to New Bedford, principally from [[Honolulu]], and was owned for several years by William H. Besse of New Bedford. As a result of its control over whaling products that were used widely throughout the world (most importantly whale oil), New Bedford became one of the richest per capita cities in the world.

Many whalers quit their jobs in 1849, though, as the [[Gold Rush]] attracted many of them to leave New Bedford for California. During this time [[Herman Melville]], who worked in New Bedford as a whaler, wrote the novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' and published it in 1851. The city is the initial setting of the book, including a scene set in the [[Seaman's Bethel]], which still stands. Despite the power it gave to New Bedford, the whaling industry began to decline starting in 1859 when [[petroleum]], which replaced [[whale oil]], was discovered. Another blow came with the [[whaling disaster of 1871]], in which 22 New Bedford whalers were lost in the ice off the coast of Alaska.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whalingmuseum.org/library/amwhale/am_arctic.html |title=Overview of American Whaling: Arctic Whaling |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110090142/http://www.whalingmuseum.org/library/amwhale/am_arctic.html |archive-date=November 10, 2011 }}</ref> The New Bedford firm [[J. & W.

In the mid-1840s, New Bedford was the site of the first petroleum fuel refinery in the United States, as newly discovered Pennsylvania crude oil was shipped to New Bedford to be refined for lamp oil and other oil. Standard Oil later bought this refinery, located on Fish Island.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=69dGAQAAIAAJ&q=Standard+Oil+Fish+Island&pg=PA198|title=Congressional Edition|date=June 17, 2017|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|via=Google Books|access-date=November 18, 2020|archive-date=February 15, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230215201354/https://books.google.com/books?id=69dGAQAAIAAJ&q=Standard+Oil+Fish+Island&pg=PA198|url-status=live}}</ref> Fish Island was also the site of an early experiment in coal gasification, leading to the explosion of a building.

New Bedford was able to remain wealthy because of its [[textile industry]]. Starting in 1881, the textile industry grew large enough to sustain the city's economy. At its height, over 30,000 people were employed by the 32 cotton-manufacturing companies that owned the textile factories of New Bedford (which were worth $100&nbsp;million in total). The creation of the [[New Bedford Institute of Technology|New Bedford Textile School]] in 1895–1899 ushered in an era of textile prosperity that began to decline in the great depression and ended with the end of the textile period in the 1940s. The industry garnered national headlines in 1928 when it was hit with a [[1928 New Bedford textile strike|strike of 30,000 workers]].<ref>See, for example: Daniel Georgianna with Roberta Hazen Aaronson, ''The Strike of '28.'' New Bedford, MA: Spinner Publications, 1993.</ref> The walkout of mostly immigrant workers was given critical support by the [[Communist Party, USA|Workers (Communist) Party]] and was the precursor of a more tumultuous [[Loray Mill strike|textile strike in North Carolina]] held the following year.

Tool and die operations also left the area steadily, starting in the 1970s.

=== Tourism ===
While accurate figures are hard to come by, [[tourism]] appears to be a growing industry. New Bedford tourism centers on fairs and festivals including the Whaling City Festival, Fourth of July, Jazzfest, Working Waterfront Festival, Polish Fest, New Bedford Day of Portugal, Senhor Da Pedra feast, Holy Ghost of Pico feast, and the Portuguese [[Feast of the Blessed Sacrament]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://portuguesefeast.com/|title=FEAST OF THE BLESSED SACRAMENT|website=portuguesefeast.com|language=en|access-date=March 27, 2017|archive-date=March 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328110119/http://portuguesefeast.com/|url-status=live}}</ref> (the largest Portuguese cultural celebration in the nation). Tourism also focuses on the historic whaling industry, and the [[New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park]] is the only national park unit that focuses on the whaling industry's impact on the history of the United States. The [[Buttonwood Park Zoo]] features various species, including two [[Asian elephant|Asian Elephants]], Emily and Ruth, the only ones in New England.

Driven in part by increased tourism, a [[Fairfield Inn by Marriott|Fairfield Inn and Suites]] hotel opened in New Bedford in late May 2010, on the edge of the city's harbor. This became the first hotel in the city to open in over 40 years, though it is well-supplied with bed and breakfast establishments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20121221%2FSCBULLETIN%2F301010312|title=Fairfield Inn earns 'Small Business of Year' award|access-date=May 10, 2013|archive-date=December 21, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221235414/http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20121221%2FSCBULLETIN%2F301010312|url-status=live}}</ref> A secondary hotel, New Bedford Harbor Hotel, opened during the summer of 2018.

===Fishing===
Despite the historical decline of fishing and whaling in New England, the [[Port of New Bedford]] continues to be a leading fishing port. From 1999 to 2019, New Bedford has been the most valuable commercial fishing port in the United States.<ref name=WPRI21 /> In 2019 the port's catch was worth a total of $451 million.<ref name=WPRI21 /> Although New Bedford only brought in the 14th largest total volume of fish among American ports in 2019, its catch was still the highest-grossing because scallops accounted for 84% of the port's annual fishing revenue.<ref name=WPRI21 /> [[Dutch Harbor, Alaska]], has the highest volume, at 763 million pounds, worth $182 million.<ref name="fotus">{{cite web |access-date=October 20, 2020 |url=https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/sustainable-fisheries/fisheries-united-states |title=Fisheries of the United States |archive-date=October 23, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201023013707/https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/sustainable-fisheries/fisheries-united-states |url-status=live }}</ref>
