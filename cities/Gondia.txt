==History==
The region is named after the [[Gondi people]], an [[Adivasi]] group in central India.  During British Rule , Proprietor of Gondia was Ponwar Rajpoot.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://gazetteers.maharashtra.gov.in/cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Bhandara%20District/appendix_g.html#.|title= Central Province District Gazetteers - Bhandara District|work=Gazetteer Department of Maharashtra|access-date=15 October 2023}}</ref>

During [[British rule in India]], the [[Great Famine of 1876–78]] provided an opportunity for the construction of a {{convert|150|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} metre-gauge rail link called the [[Nagpur Chhattisgarh Railway]], connecting Nagpur with Rajnandgaon. Gondia railway station was created when this line began operation in December 1888. [[Bengal Nagpur Railway]] (BNR) was formed in 1887 to upgrade and extend this line, and in 1902 BNR was contracted to provide a railway line from Gondia to Jabalpur with branches from Nainpur to Mandla as well as Nainpur to Seoni and Chhindwara. With these links and the commerce they brought, Gondia grew and prospered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secr.indianrailways.gov.in/uploads/files/The_Roaring_Journey.pdf|title=The Roaring Journey|work=secr.indianrailways.gov.in}}</ref>{{pages needed|date=May 2023}} In the year 1877 Near Darekasa cave Swami Vivekananda occurred his "First Trance" reference book "Journey of Swami Vivekananda to Raipur and His First Trance"(23)
