[[Ōtsu]] is the capital and largest city of Shiga Prefecture, with other major cities including [[Kusatsu, Shiga|Kusatsu]], [[Nagahama, Shiga|Nagahama]], and [[Higashiōmi]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Ōtsu" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 765|page=765}}.</ref> Shiga Prefecture encircles [[Lake Biwa]], the largest [[freshwater lake]] in Japan, and 37% of the total land area is designated as [[List of national parks of Japan|Natural Parks]], the highest of any prefecture.

Shiga Prefecture is home to [[Ōmi beef]], the [[Eight Views of Ōmi]], and [[Hikone Castle]], one of four [[List of National Treasures of Japan (castles)|national treasure castles]] in Japan.

== History ==
{{See also|Historic Sites of Shiga Prefecture}}
Shiga was known as '''[[Ōmi Province]]''' or '''Gōshū''' before the prefectural system was established.<ref>Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 780|page=780}}.</ref>  Omi was a neighbor of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] and [[Kyoto]], at the junction of western and eastern Japan. During the period 667 to 672, [[Emperor Tenji]] founded a palace in Otsu. In 742, [[Emperor Shōmu]] founded a palace in [[Shigaraki, Shiga|Shigaraki]]. In the early [[Heian period]], [[Saichō]] was born in the north of Otsu and founded [[Enryaku-ji]], the center of [[Tendai]] and a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] [[Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto (Kyoto, Uji and Otsu Cities)|and monument of Ancient Kyoto]] now.

During the [[Heian period]], the [[Sasaki clan]] ruled Omi, and afterward, the [[Rokkaku clan]], [[Kyōgoku clan]], and [[Azai clan]]s ruled Omi. While during the [[Azuchi–Momoyama period|Azuchi-Momoyama period]], [[Oda Nobunaga]] subjugated Omi and built [[Azuchi Castle]] on the eastern shores of [[Lake Biwa]] in 1579. [[Tōdō Takatora]], [[Gamō Ujisato]], [[Oichi]], [[Yodo-dono]], [[Ohatsu]], and [[Oeyo]] were Omi notables during this period.

In 1600, [[Ishida Mitsunari]], born in the east of Nagahama and based in [[Sawayama Castle]], made war against [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] in [[Sekigahara, Gifu]]. After the battle, Ieyasu made [[Ii Naomasa]] a new lord of Sawayama. Naomasa established the [[Hikone Domain]], later famous for [[Ii Naosuke]]. Ii Naosuke became the Tokugawa shogunate's [[Tairō]] and concluded commercial treaties with the Western powers and thus ended Japan's isolation from the world in the 19th century. Besides the Hikone Domain, many domains ruled Omi such as [[Zeze Domain|Zeze]].
[[File:Complete map of Shiga Prefecture, 1880.jpg|thumb|Map of Shiga Prefecture, 1880]]
With the [[abolition of the han system]], eight prefectures were formed in Omi. They were unified into Shiga Prefecture in September 1872. "Shiga Prefecture" was named after "[[Shiga District, Shiga|Shiga District]]" because Otsu belonged to the district until 1898. From August 1876 to February 1881, southern Fukui Prefecture had been incorporated into Shiga Prefecture.

In 2015, Shiga Governor [[Taizō Mikazuki]] conducted a survey asking citizens whether they felt it necessary to change the name of the prefecture, partly to raise its profile as a destination for domestic tourism.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/04/28/national/shiga-prefecture-mulls-name-change-draw-visitors/#.VmV_xct961s | title = Shiga Prefecture mulls name change to draw more visitors | newspaper = [[The Japan Times]]}}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:Lake biwa.jpg|thumb|Lake Biwa in Shiga Prefecture viewed from space]]

Shiga borders [[Fukui Prefecture]] in the north, [[Gifu Prefecture]] in the east, [[Mie Prefecture]] in the southeast, and [[Kyoto Prefecture]] in the west.

Lake Biwa, Japan's largest, is located at the center of this prefecture. It occupies one-sixth of its area. The [[Seta River]] flows from Lake Biwa to [[Osaka Bay]] through [[Kyoto]]. This is the only natural river that flows out from the lake. Most other natural rivers flow into the lake. There were many lagoons around Lake Biwa, but most of them were reclaimed in 1940s. One of the preserved lagoons is the {{nihongo|wetland|水郷|suigō}} in Omihachiman, and it was selected as the first [[Cultural Landscapes of Japan|Important Cultural Landscapes]] in 2006.

The lake divides the prefecture into four different areas: ''Kohoku'' (湖北, north of lake) centered Nagahama, ''Kosei'' (湖西, west of lake) centered [[Imazu, Shiga|Imazu]], ''Kotō'' (湖東, east of lake) centered Hikone and ''Konan'' (湖南, south of lake) centered Otsu.

Plains stretch to the eastern shore of Lake Biwa. The prefecture is enclosed by mountain ranges with the [[Hira Mountains]] and [[Mount Hiei]] in the west, the [[Ibuki Mountains]] in the northeast, and the [[Suzuka Mountains]] in the southeast. [[Mount Ibuki]] is the highest mountain in Shiga. In [[Yogo, Shiga|Yogo]], a small lake is famous for the legend of {{nihongo|the heavenly robe of an angel|天女の羽衣|[[tennin|tennyo]] no hagoromo}}, which is similar to a western [[Swan maiden]].<ref>{{cite web | author = Shiga Prefecture | script-title=ja:余呉湖・天女の衣掛柳 | trans-title = Lake Yogo - a willow hung a celestial robe | url = http://www.pref.shiga.lg.jp/minwa/41/41-movie.html | access-date = 2011-05-13 | language = ja}}</ref>

Shiga's climate sharply varies between north and south. Southern Shiga is usually warm, but northern Shiga is typically cold with high snowfall and hosts many skiing grounds. In Nakanokawachi, the northernmost village of Shiga, snow reached a depth of {{convert|5.6|m}} in 1936.<ref>Encyclopedia Shiga. p436.</ref>

As of 1 April 2014, 37% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as [[List of national parks of Japan#History|Natural Parks]] (the highest total of any prefecture), namely the [[Biwako Quasi-National Park|Biwako]] and [[Suzuka Quasi-National Park|Suzuka]] Quasi-National Parks; and [[Kotō Prefectural Natural Park|Kotō]], [[Kutsuki-Katsuragawa Prefectural Natural Park|Kutsuki-Katsuragawa]], and [[Mikami-Tanakami-Shigaraki Prefectural Natural Park|Mikami-Tanakami-Shigaraki]] Prefectural Natural Parks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/nps/park/doc/files/np_6.pdf |title=General overview of area figures for Natural Parks by prefecture |publisher=[[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] |date=1 April 2014 |access-date=3 July 2015}}</ref>

The current governor of Shiga is [[Taizō Mikazuki]], a former member of the House of Representatives from Shiga ([[Democratic Party of Japan|DPJ]], 3rd district), who was narrowly [[2014 Shiga gubernatorial election|elected in July 2014]] with center-left support against ex-METI-bureaucrat [[Takashi Koyari]] (supported by the center-right national-level ruling parties) to succeed governor [[Yukiko Kada]]. In June 2018, he was [[2018 Shiga gubernatorial election|overwhelmingly reelected to a second term]] against only one, Communist challenger.<ref>Shiga prefectural government: [https://www.pref.shiga.lg.jp/kensei/chizi/ Governor's office] (Japanese, English machine translation available by clicking "Foreign Language")</ref><ref>[[The Japan Times]], July 14, 2014: [https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/07/14/national/politics-diplomacy/ldp-candidate-flounders-shiga-gubernatorial-elections/ LDP candidate flounders in Shiga governor race], retrieved August 1, 2019.</ref><ref>[[NHK]] Senkyo Web, June 24, 2018: [https://www.nhk.or.jp/senkyo/database/local/2018/shiga-chiji.html 2018滋賀県知事選], retrieved August 1, 2019.</ref>

The [[Shiga Prefectural Assembly|prefectural assembly]] has 44 members from 16 electoral districts, and is still elected in unified local elections (last round: [[2019 Japanese unified local elections|2019]]). As of July 2019, the assembly was composed by caucus as follows: [[Liberal Democratic Party of Japan|LDP]] 20 members, Team Shiga ([[Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan|CDP]], [[Democratic Party for the People|DPP]], former Kada supporters etc.) 14, [[Japanese Communist Party|JCP]] 4, Sazanami Club (of independents) 3, [[Kōmeitō]] 2, "independent"/non-attached 1.<ref>Prefectural assembly: [http://www.shigaken-gikai.jp/g07_Kaiha.asp Members by caucus] {{in lang|ja}}, retrieved August 1, 2019.</ref>

In the [[National Diet]], Shiga is represented by four directly elected members of the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] and two (one per ordinary election) of the [[House of Councillors]]. For the proportional representation segment of the lower house, the prefecture forms part of the [[Kinki proportional representation block|Kinki block]]. After the national elections of [[2016 Japanese House of Councillors election|2016]], [[2017 Japanese House of Representatives election|2017]] and [[2019 Japanese House of Councillors election|2019]], the directly elected delegation to the Diet from Shiga consists of (as of August 1, 2019):

[[File:Omihachiman shimmatidori01s3200.jpg|thumb|Merchant mansions in Omihachiman]]

Cultivated areas occupy nearly one-sixth of the prefecture. Rice is the principal crop: over 90 percent of the farmlands are rice fields. Most farms are small, producing only a slight income. Most farmers depend on income from other sources. Eastern Shiga is famous for [[cattle breeding]] and southeastern Shiga is famous for [[green tea]]. On Lake Biwa, some people are engaged in fishery and [[freshwater pearl]] farming.

Since the Medieval Period, especially in [[Edo period]], many Shiga people were active in [[commerce]] and were called {{nihongo|Ōmi merchants|近江商人|Ōmi shōnin, Ōmi akindo}}, sometimes {{nihongo|Ōmi thieves|近江泥棒|Ōmi dorobō}} by other envious merchants. For example, [[Nippon Life]], [[Itochu]], [[Marubeni]], [[Takashimaya]], [[Wacoal]] and [[Yanmar]] were founded by people from Shiga. In their home towns such as Omihachiman, Hino, [[Gokashō, Shiga|Gokashō]] and Toyosato, their mansions were preserved as tourist attractions.

Beginning in the 1960s, Shiga developed industry, supporting major factories owned by companies such as [[IBM Japan]], [[Canon (company)|Canon]], [[Yanmar Diesel]], [[Mitsubishi]], and [[Toray]]. According to [[Cabinet Office (Japan)|Cabinet Office]]'s statistics in 2014, the [[Manufacturing]] sector accounted for 35.4% of Gross Shiga Product, the highest proportion in Japan.<ref name="best scores">{{cite web | author = Shiga Prefecture | script-title=ja:滋賀県の紹介（滋賀県なんでも一番） | trans-title = Introduction of Shiga prefecture; Best scores of Shiga | url = http://www.pref.shiga.lg.jp/profile/seikatsu/index.html | access-date = 2011-05-08 | language = ja}}</ref> Traditional industries include textiles, [[Shigaraki ware]], [[Butsudan]] in Hikone and Nagahama, medicines in Koka, and fan ribs in [[Adogawa, Shiga|Adogawa]].

The population is concentrated along the southern shore of Lake Biwa in Otsu city (adjacent to Kyoto) and along the lake's eastern shore in cities such as Kusatsu and Moriyama, which are [[Greater Kyoto|within commuting distance to Kyoto]]. The lake's western and northern shores are more rural and resort-oriented with white sand beaches. In recent years, many Brazilians settled in Shiga to work in nearby factories. 25,040 foreigners live in Shiga and 30% of foreigners were Brazilians as of December 2016.<ref>{{cite web | author = Shiga Prefecture | script-title=ja:滋賀県内の外国人人口 | trans-title = The number of foreigners in Shiga Prefecture | url = http://www.pref.shiga.lg.jp/b/kokusai/tabunka/population.html | access-date = 2017-11-07 | language = ja}}</ref>

=== Cuisine ===
Since ancient times, Shigans have eaten fish from Lake Biwa. The most famous lake-food is {{nihongo|[[narezushi|fermented sushi]] of [[crucian carp]]|鮒寿司|funa-zushi}}. It retains the ancient style of sushi and has a pungent odor. Shiga is also famous for high quality [[wagyū]], [[Ōmi beef]]. The Hikone Domain presented beef as medicinal food to shōguns.<ref>{{cite web | author = The promoting council of production and distribution of Ōmi beef | script-title=ja:近江牛の歴史 | trans-title = The history of Ōmi beef | url = http://www.oumiushi.com/history.html | access-date = 2011-05-14 | language = ja}}</ref> In addition, ''[[tsukemono]]'' of root crops, {{nihongo|[[mallard]] [[nabemono|nabe]] or mallard [[sukiyaki]]|[[:ja:鴨鍋|鴨鍋]] or 鴨すき|kamo-nabe or kamo-suki}} in northern Shiga, {{nihongo|red colored [[konjac]]|赤こんにゃく|aka konnyaku}} in Omihachiman, {{Nihongo|[[sōmen]] with grilled [[mackerel]]|[[:ja:焼鯖素麺|焼鯖素麺]]|yaki-saba sōmen}} in Nagahama, and lightly seasoned [[champon]] in Hikone are examples of specific cuisine in Shiga.

Shiga has many [[tourism]] resources, but Shiga is overshadowed by its much more famous neighbor Kyoto. Over four million foreign tourists visited Japan in 2000, but only sixty-five thousand visited Shiga.<ref>{{cite web | author = Shiga Prefecture | script-title=ja:湖国観光交流ビジョン 第２章 滋賀県観光の現状と課題 | trans-title = The vision for tourism and exchange of the Lake Country.

The main gateways to Shiga are the [[Maibara Station]] in northern Shiga and the city of [[Ōtsu]] in the south. The Maibara Station is about 2 hours and 20 minutes away from the [[Tokyo Station]] by the Tokaido Shinkansen. It is easy to go to Ōtsu from Kyoto and Osaka by high-speed trains.

Shiga's most prominent feature is Lake Biwa. The northern shore is especially scenic, such as the cherry blossoms of Kaizu Osaki in spring and the sacred island [[Chikubu Island|Chikubu-shima]]. The western shore has white sand beaches, popular among Kyotoites during the summer. The scenery of the southern shore, particularly around Otsu, was selected as ''Ōmi Hakkei'' or [[Eight Views of Ōmi]], popularized by [[Hiroshige]]'s [[ukiyo-e]]. Most of the original eight views are now almost gone or changed from centuries ago. One remaining view is the Ukimidō "floating temple" building at [[Mangetsu-ji]] temple in Katata, northern Ōtsu. It was reconstructed with concrete in 1937, but a small temple still stands on the lake near the shore, accessible by a short bridge. Another scene features [[Ishiyama-dera]] temple in southern Otsu, which is also renowned for having a room where [[Murasaki Shikibu]] thought up the plan for some chapters of ''[[Tale of Genji]]''.

The mountains around the lake offer extensive views. Mount Hira is a picnic spot. Mountain roads like the Oku-Biwako Parkway road up north and the Hiei-zan Driveway and Oku-Hiei Driveway overlooking the southwestern shore. In Ōtsu, the Ōtsu Prince Hotel's Top of Otsu restaurant provides views of the lake and city. The ''Michigan'' paddlewheel boat offers lake cruises.

Besides the natural environment, historical buildings and festivals persons rank among those of national importance.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} Shiga has 807 [[National Treasures of Japan|National Treasures]] and [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Properties]], that ranks the fourth large number in Japan.<ref name="best scores"/> Shiga's most famous historical building is [[Hikone Castle]], one of four [[List of National Treasures of Japan (castles)|national treasure castles]] in the country. The castle tower is well preserved and has many cherry trees. The neighboring city of [[Nagahama, Shiga|Nagahama]] has [[Nagahama, Shiga#Sightseeing|tourism]] in addition to its hikiyama festival. Nearby shrines include [[Hiyoshi Taisha]] in Otsu and [[Taga-taisha]] in Taga, which respectively head the seventh and twentieth largest [[Shinto shrine#Shrine networks|shrine network]]s in Japan, at about 4,000 shrines and 260 shrines, respectively.

Festivals include the hikiyama festival (floats parade festival), held in ten areas such as [[Nagahama, Shiga|Nagahama]], Otsu, Maibara, Hino and Minakuchi. The Nagahama hikiyama festival held each April is one of the three major hikiyama festivals in Japan and was designated an Important Intangible Cultural Property in 1979. During this festival ornate floats are mounted with miniature stages on which boys (playing both male and female roles) act in [[kabuki]] plays.<ref>{{cite web | author = Biwako Visitors Bureau | script-title=ja:滋賀県観光情報：長浜曳山まつり | trans-title = Shiga tourism information: Nagahama hikiyama festival | url = http://www.biwako-visitors.jp/search/event_182.html | access-date = 2011-05-20 | language = ja}}</ref> Higashiomi (formerly [[Yōkaichi, Shiga|Yōkaichi]]) city holds a Giant Kite Festival every May along the riverbank. Ordinary people are invited to pull the rope that sends the kites aloft.
