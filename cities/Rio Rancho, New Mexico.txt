'''Rio Rancho''' ({{langx|es|Río Rancho}}) is the largest and most populous city in [[Sandoval County, New Mexico|Sandoval County]], part of the expansive [[Albuquerque metropolitan area]], in the U.S. state of [[New Mexico]]. A small portion of the city extends into northern [[Bernalillo County, New Mexico|Bernalillo County]].

It is the [[List of municipalities in New Mexico|third-largest city in New Mexico]], and one of the most rapidly growing. As of the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]], Rio Rancho had a population of 104,046.<ref>https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/rioranchocitynewmexico {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2024}}</ref> The name ''Rio Rancho'' derives from [[Los Ranchos de Albuquerque|''Los Ranchos'']], the Spanish colonial ranches established along the [[Rio Grande]] in the [[Albuquerque Basin]], and throughout historic [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México|Nuevo México]]. There were large ranches also in neighboring [[Corrales, New Mexico|Corrales]]. Since the late 20th century, it has developed as a suburb of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]].

== History ==
{{unsourced|section|date=June 2024}}
[[File:RIO RANCHO ESTATES SUBDIVISION - NARA - 545347.jpg|thumb|left|Rio Rancho Estates in 1970, with the [[Sandia Mountains]] in the background]]

The great majority of the territory of Rio Rancho was originally part of the Town of Alameda Grant, which was founded by Spanish colonial settlers in 1710. It was acquired by the United States in 1848, after it defeated Mexico in the Mexican-American War. (Mexico had been independent of Spain since 1821.) The ranches were used for cattle and sheep.

By the early 20th century, much of the land grant had been divided and sold to land investment companies. Its proximity to the city of Albuquerque made it a prime area for suburban development in the post-World War II period. In 1961 [[Amrep Corporation]] purchased {{convert|55000|acre}} and created a housing development called "[[Rio Rancho Estates]]". The first families moved into this development in the early 1960s.

Amrep contracted with [[Ezio Valentini]], one of the original developers of [[Cape Coral, Florida]], to design and implement a marketing plan to encourage land sales. He organized dinner-parties for prospective customers in northern states through offices in 14 states. Migrants were attracted to this area, and the population grew ten-fold between 1970 and 1980. The City of Rio Rancho was incorporated in 1981. The opening of a large [[Intel Corporation]] plant in 1981 generated numerous jobs and had positive economic effects for the city.

Since the 1990s, Rio Rancho has taken steps to become more independent from neighboring Albuquerque. It established a separate public unified school district and library system. It is seeking to attract more businesses to the area, so that residents might live and work here.

In the early 21st century, the city worked to create a center: the Downtown City Centre development included a new [[city hall]], a new [[University of New Mexico]] West and [[Central New Mexico Community College]] campus, and the [[Santa Ana Star Center]]. The sports and live event arena opened in October 2006. City Hall opened in September 2007.

The Intel Corporation is by far the largest employer in Rio Rancho. The services, retail, and government sectors are also major components of the local economy.

Rio Rancho is the site of Intel's [[Fab 11X|Intel Fab 11X]], one of the largest [[semiconductor fabrication plant]]s in the world. The fully automated, $2&nbsp;billion facility opened in 2002 and was the first Intel plant to manufacture 300&nbsp;mm [[silicon]] wafers, which can hold almost twice as many chips as the standard 200&nbsp;mm wafers. Fab 7, Intel's original Rio Rancho plant which opened in 1980, closed in 2002, but was converted into a test facility in 2005.

In 2005, Rio Rancho became the first U.S. city to offer citywide voice-over-[[WiFi]] (VoWiFi) service. Many residents complained that the service did not live up to their expectations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Several call centers are located in Rio Rancho. [[Walmart]] opened in early summer of 2006 in Rio Rancho, and was a catalyst for related commercial retailers to locate nearby.

An Albuquerque-based incubator and co-working space "FatPipe" opened a satellite office in Rio Rancho.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fatpipeabq.com/rio-rancho-coworking/|title=FatPipe - Rio Rancho|access-date=October 29, 2019}}</ref> It is intended to spur business innovation and startups within the city.

=== Taxation ===

In 2010 the City Council passed an automatic annual increase in water rate, equivalent to 25% over a five-year period.<ref>[http://riorancho.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=537 Utilities Commission – May 18th, 2010].

=== Housing and development ===
[[File:Rio Rancho Sprawl.jpeg|thumb|Aerial view of suburban Rio Rancho]]
In the aftermath of the collapse of the 2008 housing bubble, [[foreclosure]] activity increased in the city. The economies of Sandoval, Bernalillo, and Valencia counties suffered markedly in the [[late 2000s recession]].<ref name="NPRmap">[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111494514&sc=nl&cc=bh-20090807 Interactive Map: The Economy Where You Live], from NPR.</ref>

As of the late 2010s, housing had entirely recovered. A number of new housing developments were restarted. Real estate sales were robust in 2020 in many areas of Rio Rancho, driven by low interest rates and relatively low housing prices ($250,000 - $350,000 for most new construction).<ref>[https://www.abqjournal.com/1493476/naiop-speakers-residential-growth-exploding-in-rr.html][[Commercial Real Estate Development Association|NAIOP]]<span>) speakers: Residential growth exploding in RR</span>, ''RR Observer''</ref>

=== Tourism ===
In 2017, Rio Rancho hosted the [[National Speleological Society]]'s annual convention.

The city constructed A Park Above, a structure in the south of the city for youth recreation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rrnm.gov/2710/A-Park-Above|title=A Park Above {{!}} The Official Site of Rio Rancho, NM|website=rrnm.gov|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=2017 NSS Convention|url=http://nss2017.caves.org/|website=2017 NSS Convention|access-date=23 December 2016}}</ref>

== Media ==
Rio Rancho is home to the Albuquerque metro area's only oldies-format radio station, [[KDSK (AM)]]. It moved into this market in March 2015 and licensed its newest FM signal, 92.9&nbsp;FM, to Rio Rancho in April 2016. The station is named "Rio Rancho Radio". The station features Rio Rancho area events and airs a weekly talk/discussion show on Sunday mornings with the Mayor of Rio Rancho (now Greg Hull).  The station signal, broadcast on three frequencies (92.7&nbsp;FM, 93.7&nbsp;FM, and 1240&nbsp;AM), serves the entire Albuquerque metro area, and six counties in central and western New Mexico. Residents also have access to television and radio broadcasts from Albuquerque.

The weekly ''Rio Rancho Observer'' is the local newspaper. Residents may also subscribe to the daily newspaper ''[[Albuquerque Journal]]'', which has a localized weekly version called ''[[Rio West]]''.

Rio Rancho is served by a [[government-access television]] channel available only through the city's only cable television provider [[Cable One|Cable ONE]]. This channel shows all of the government meetings multiple times.

== Transportation ==
Albuquerque's transit department, [[ABQ RIDE]], operates a bus route (251 Albuquerque-Rio Rancho Rail Runner Connection) connecting Rio Rancho with the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express]] station at [[Los Ranchos/Journal Center (Rail Runner station)|Journal Center]].

In late January 2011, ABQ RIDE extended two additional routes (96 Crosstown Commuter and 155 Coors Blvd), and introduced an additional route (551 Jefferson/Paseo Del Norte Express) into Rio Rancho. The northern terminus of these routes is at Southern Blvd and Unser Blvd. 
<!-- discredited below Other than these few extensions from the Albuquerque Transit system, no public transportation is available in Rio Rancho. Also, the city is so poorly planned that there are miles of empty space between major destinations in the city. -->

The Rio Metro Regional Transportation District operates Rio Transit, a door-to-door paratransit service for senior citizens 55 years of age and older, and disabled adults 18 years of age and older, for residents of Rio Rancho. The service is operated from the Meadowlark Senior Center, and provides service Monday-Friday from 7:30&nbsp;am to 3:00&nbsp;pm. Riders must register with the service prior to using it and reserve time slots well in advance.

Rio Metro RTD also operates a commuter bus route serving the Enchanted Hills neighborhood in Rio Rancho. This service connects residents of Enchanted Hills to the US&nbsp;550 New Mexico Rail Runner station and provides service during the morning and evening commutes. Rio Metro Bus connections are available at the US&nbsp;550 Rail Runner station for Zia Pueblo, San Ysidro, Canon, and Jemez Springs. A Rio Metro commuter bus route provides service to and from the Cuba NM area, with a Park and Ride designated at Home Depot, which is located near the corner of NM&nbsp;528, NM&nbsp;550.
