==Geography==
Nanyang is located in southwestern Henan, bordering Hubei ([[Xiangyang]], [[Shiyan]], and [[Suizhou]]) to the south, Shaanxi ([[Shangluo]]) to the west and the following prefecture-level cities in Henan:

* Zhumadian (E)
* Xinyang (SE)
* Sanmenxia (NW)
* Luoyang (N)
* Pingdingshan (NE)

The latitude of the entire prefecture ranges from 32° 17' to 33° 48' N, while the longitude ranges from 110° 58' to 113° 49' E, and the prefecture spans {{convert|26600|km2}}. The city lies within the [[Nanyang Basin]], which is part of a region in Central China that lies in the gap between the eastern end of the [[Qin Mountains]] and the source of the [[Huai River]]. Thus, using those two geographic features as the standard dividing line, it is difficult to classify the city into [[Northern and southern China|northern or southern China]].

To the north of Nanyang city proper, there is a mountain called [[Mount Du]], which is famous for the [[Chinese jade|Dushan jade]], one of the four famous jades of China, now a rarity. To the southwest is [[Neixiang County]] with the newly developing Baotianman Biosphere Reserve&mdash;an area of high biodiversity, with 65 rare and endangered species.

The official language of Nanyang is [[Mandarin Chinese]], but most locals speak the [[Central Plains Mandarin|Henan dialect]], with its easily identifiable stereotypical features; this local dialect is known as Nanyang Hua ({{lang|zh-hans|南阳话}}), and is spoken by about 15 million people in the area.

There are mainly Chu culture series, Han culture series, Three Kingdoms culture series, and various ancient architectural development and utilization series. The rare treasures unearthed from the Spring and Autumn tombs in Danyang, the capital of Chu, are well-known and the Chu Great Wall site, known as the "father of the Great Wall of China," has attracted attention. The Han cultural relics in Nanyang, represented by the "Three Wonders of Nanyang Han Culture" such as portrait stones, portrait bricks, and pottery dogs, rank first in the country in terms of quantity, scale, content, research, and tourism value discovered; There are also the largest ancient iron smelting workshop in the country - the Wafangzhuang site, the sizable Han Wancheng site, the medical saint temple where the famous Han Dynasty great medical expert Zhang Zhongjing's ancestral tomb is located, and the famous tomb of the Eastern Han Dynasty scientist and writer Zhang Heng at home and abroad. The historical influence of the Three Kingdoms period is profound, and the remaining relics mainly include the Wuhou Temple, Weigong Bridge, Fengchu Terrace, as well as the ancient battlefield of Huoshao Bowang in Fangcheng and the council stage in Xinye.
