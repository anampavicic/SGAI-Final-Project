'''Seville''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|v|ɪ|l}} {{respell|sə|VIL}}; {{langx|es|Sevilla}}, {{IPA|es|seˈβiʎa|pron|Pronunciation of Seville in Spanish.ogg}}) is the capital and largest city of the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Andalusia]] and the [[province of Seville]]. It is situated on the lower reaches of the [[Guadalquivir|River Guadalquivir]], in the southwest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

Seville has a municipal population of about 701,000  {{As of|2022|lc=y}}, and a [[List of metropolitan areas in Spain|metropolitan]] population of about 1.5&nbsp;million, making it the largest city in Andalusia, the [[List of metropolitan areas in Spain|fourth-largest city in Spain]] and the [[Largest cities of the European Union by population within city limits|25th most populous municipality]] in the [[European Union]]. Its [[old town]], with an area of {{convert|4|km²|0|abbr=out}}, contains a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] comprising three buildings: the [[Alcázar of Seville|Alcázar palace complex]], the [[Seville Cathedral|Cathedral]] and the [[General Archive of the Indies]]. The Seville harbour, located about {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=off}} from the Atlantic Ocean, is the only river port in Spain.<ref name="ESA2020">{{cite web |author1=Staff |title=Seville, Spain |url=https://earth.esa.int/web/earth-watching/change-detection/content/-/article/seville-spain |website=earth.esa.int |publisher=ESA Earth Online 2000 - 2020 |access-date=21 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200321230944/https://earth.esa.int/web/earth-watching/change-detection/content/-/article/seville-spain |archive-date=21 March 2020 |date=2020}}</ref> The capital of Andalusia features hot temperatures in the summer, with daily maximums routinely above {{convert|35|°C}} in July and August.

Seville was founded as the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city of {{lang|la|Hispalis}}. Known as ''Ishbiliyah'' after the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Islamic conquest]] in 711, Seville became the centre of the independent [[Taifa of Seville]] following the collapse of the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]] in the early 11th century; later it was ruled by [[Almoravids]] and [[Almohad dynasty|Almohads]] until being incorporated to the [[Crown of Castile]] in 1248.<ref name="Christian-Muslim Relations.

Following a deterioration in drought conditions in the Guadalquivir, the American trade gradually moved away from the city of Seville, in favour initially of downstream-dependent berths and eventually of the [[Bay of Cádiz]] &ndash; to which were eventually transferred control of both the [[Spanish treasure fleet|fleets of the Indies]] (1680) and the [[Casa de Contratación]] (1717).<ref>{{Cite journal|title=La organización portuaria del golfo de Cádiz en los siglos XVI y XVII: el Arenal de Sevilla y sus antepuertos|pages=430–431|first=Marcos|url=https://revistaseug.ugr.es/index.php/cnova/article/view/7672/21399/|last=Pachecho Morales-Padrón|year=2021|doi=10.30827/cnova.v0i47.7672|journal=Chronica Nova|volume=47|location=Granada|publisher=[[University of Granada|Editorial Universidad de Granada]]|issn=0210-9611}}</ref>

The 20th century in Seville saw the tribulations of the [[Spanish Civil War]], decisive cultural milestones such as the [[Ibero-American Exposition of 1929]] and [[Seville Expo '92|Expo '92]], and the city's election as the capital of the [[Andalusian Autonomous Government|Autonomous Community of Andalusia]].

==Name==
===Etymology and derivatives ===
According to Manuel Pellicer Catalán, the ancient name was ''Spal'', and it meant "lowland" in the [[Phoenician language]] ([[cognate]] to the Hebrew ''[[Shfela]]'' and the Arabic ''Asfal'' {{lang|ar|أسفل|link=no}}).<ref name="SPAL: Revista de prehistoria y arqueología de la Universidad de Sevilla">{{cite book|title=SPAL: Revista de prehistoria y arqueología de la Universidad de Sevilla|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rFhpAAAAMAAJ|access-date=8 February 2013|year=1998|publisher=Secretariado de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Sevilla|page=93|quote=La presencia de fenicios en la antigua Sevilla parece constatada por el topónimo Spal que en diversas lenguas semíticas significa "zona baja", "llanura verde" o "valle profundo"}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/fichero_articulo?codigo=634185&orden=0|title= La Emergencia de Sevilla|publisher= Universidad de Sevilla |access-date=11 May 2011}}</ref> It is ultimately from Phoenician ''sefela'', meaning "plain, valley."<ref>{{OEtymD|Seville|accessdate=2024-09-21}}</ref> ''Hisbaal'' is another old name for Seville. It appears to have originated during the [[Phoenicia]]n colonisation of the [[Tartessos|Tartessian]] culture in south-western Iberia, and according to a new proposal, it refers to the god [[Baal]].<ref>{{cite book |url= http://rodin.uca.es/xmlui/handle/10498/15101 |title= De Coripe a Sevilla por Utrera: formación y deformación de topónimos en el habla |publisher= Diputación de Sevilla |access-date= 11 September 2018 |isbn= 978-84-940980-0-0 |date=2013 |archive-date= 24 February 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210224081740/https://rodin.uca.es/xmlui/handle/10498/15101 }}</ref> 

During [[Hispania|Roman rule]], the name was Latinised as {{lang|la|Hispal}} and later as {{lang|la|Hispalis}}. After the [[Umayyad]] invasion, this name remained in use among the [[Mozarabs]],<ref name="Mena 1992"/> being adapted into Arabic as ''Išbīliya'' ({{lang|ar|إشبيلية}}): since the /p/ [[phoneme]] does not exist in Arabic, it was replaced by /b/; the Latin place-name suffix ''-is'' was Arabized as ''-iya'', and ''a'' {{IPA|/æ/}} turned into ''ī'' {{IPA|/iː/}} due to the phonetic phenomenon called ''[[imāla]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biografías mudéjares, o, La experiencia de ser minoría: biografías islámicas en la España cristiana|year=2008|page=394|isbn=978-84-00-08744-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hxgsAQAAIAAJ|last1=Echevarria|first1=Ana|publisher=Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas }}</ref>

In the meantime, the city's official name had been changed to ''Ḥimṣ al-Andalus'' ({{lang|ar|حمص الأندلس}}), in reference to the city of [[Homs]] in modern Syria, [[Jund Hims|the jund of which]] Seville had been assigned to upon the Umayyad conquest;<ref>{{cite book|last=Gerber|first=Jane S.|year=1992|title=The Jews of Spain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ry5XyRIl6V4C|page=31|publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-1-4391-0783-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=José María de Mena Plaza & Janés|year=1985|title=Historia de Sevilla|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_kqAQAAMAAJ|page=47|publisher=Plaza & Janés |isbn=978-84-01-37200-1}}</ref><ref name="Mena 1992">{{cite book|title=Art and History of Seville|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p8SwKYtmy94C|page=6|author=José María de Mena|year=1992| publisher=Casa Editrice Bonechi |isbn = 978-88-7009-851-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Calvert|title=Southern Spain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCdwDwAAQBAJ|year=2018|page=17|publisher=BoD – Books on Demand |isbn=978-3-7340-3692-7}}</ref> "Ḥimṣ al-Andalus" remained a customary and affectionate name for the city during the whole period throughout the Muslim Arab world,<ref name="Mena 1992"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Vinieron los Sarracenos...: el universo mental de la conquista de América|last=Manrique|first=Nelson|year=1993|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ig1pAAAAMAAJ|page=178|publisher=DESCO |isbn=978-84-89312-04-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Islamic And Christian Spain in the Early Middle Ages|first=Thomas F.|last=Glick|year=2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cWqmebvcjj0C|page=48|publisher=BRILL |isbn=90-04-14771-3}}</ref> being referred to for example in the encyclopedia of [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Islamic and Christian Spain in the Early Middle Ages|page=323|first=Thomas F.|last=Glick|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wAoWAQAAMAAJ|year=1979|publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-7837-0098-4}}</ref> or in [[Abu al-Baqa ar-Rundi]]'s ''[[Ritha' al-Andalus]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Jalel|last=El Gharbi|title=Thrène de Séville|journal=Cahiers de la Méditerranée|issue=79|year=2009|pages=26–30|doi=10.4000/cdlm.4901|url=https://journals.openedition.org/cdlm/4901|language=fr|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The city is sometimes referred to as the "Pearl of Andalusia".

The inhabitants of the city are known as {{lang|es|sevillanos}} (feminine form: {{lang|es|sevillanas}}) or {{lang|es|hispalenses}}, after the Roman name of the city.

===Motto===
''NO8DO'' is the official motto of Seville, popularly believed to be a [[rebus]] signifying the Spanish {{lang|es|No me ha dejado}}, meaning "She [Seville] has not abandoned me". The phrase, pronounced with [[synalepha]] as {{IPA|es|no ma ðeˈxaðo|}} no-madeja-do, is written with an eight in the middle representing the word {{lang|es|madeja}} {{IPA|es|maˈðexa|}} "skein [of wool]". Legend states that the title was given by King [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X]], who was resident in the city's [[Alcázar of Seville|Alcázar]] and supported by the citizens when his son, later [[Sancho IV of Castile]], tried to usurp the throne from him.

The emblem is present on Seville's municipal flag, and features on city property such as manhole covers, and [[Christopher Columbus]]'s tomb in the cathedral.

==History==
{{Main|History of Seville|Timeline of Seville}}
Seville is approximately 2,200 years old. The passage of the various civilizations instrumental in its growth has left the city with a distinct personality, and a large and well-preserved historical centre.

The city was known from [[Hispania|Roman times]] as ''Hispal'' and later as ''Hispalis''.

Existing Roman features in Seville itself include the remains exposed ''in situ'' in the underground Antiquarium of the [[Metropol Parasol]] building, the remnants of an [[Caños de Carmona|aqueduct]], three pillars of a [[Roman temple|temple]] in ''Mármoles'' Street, the columns of [[La Alameda, Seville|La Alameda de Hércules]] and the remains in the Patio de Banderas square near the [[Seville Cathedral]]. The walls surrounding the city were originally built during the rule of [[Julius Caesar]], but their current course and design were the result of Moorish reconstructions.<ref name="degelo.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.degelo.com/sevilla/sev3.htm |title=Antiguas Murallas y Puertas de Sevilla |website=Degelo.com |access-date=12 March 2012}}</ref>

Following Roman rule, there were successive conquests of the Roman province of ''[[Hispania Baetica]]'' by the Germanic [[Vandals]], [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]] during the 5th and 6th centuries.

===Middle Ages===
In the wake of the [[Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula]], Seville (''Spalis'') was seemingly taken by [[Musa ibn Nusayr]] in the late summer of 712, while he was on his way to [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]].<ref name=gathane /> Yet it had to be retaken in July 713 by troops led by his son [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa]], as the Visigothic population who had fled to [[Beja, Portugal|Beja]] had returned to Seville once Musa left for Mérida.<ref name=gathane /> The seat of the [[Wali (administrative title)|Wali]] of [[Al-Andalus]] (administrative division of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]) was thus established in the city until 716,<ref name=gathane>{{Cite book|chapter=La influencia del río Guadalquivir en la imagen de la ciudad de Sevilla a lo largo de los siglos|first=José|last=González Athané|title=Paisajes modelados por el agua: entre el arte y la ingeniería |chapter-url=https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/4521997.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/4521997.pdf |archive-date=9 October 2022 |url-status=live|year=2012|isbn=978-84-9852-345-4<!--|pages=97-109-->|page=102}}</ref> when the capital of Al-Andalus was relocated to [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]].<ref>{{Cite journal|page=167|url=https://al-qantara.revistas.csic.es/index.php/al-qantara/article/view/34/28|location=Madrid|publisher=[[Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas|Ediciones CSIC]]|last=Calvo Capilla|first=Susana|year=2007|title=Las primeras mezquitas de al-Andalus a través de las fuentes árabes (92/711 – 170/785)|journal=Al-Qanṭara|volume=28|issue=1<!--|pages=143–179-->|doi=10.3989/alqantara.2007.v28.i1.34|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The city's development continued after the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] conquest in 1248. Public buildings were constructed including churches—many of which were built in the [[Mudéjar]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] styles—such as the Seville Cathedral, built during the 15th century with [[Gothic architecture]].<ref name="Norwich2001">{{cite book|author=John Julius Norwich|title=Great Architecture of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oo2BjGYRIT0C|access-date=15 May 2013|date=1 April 2001|publisher=Da Capo Press, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-306-81042-8|page=271}}</ref> Other Moorish buildings were converted into Catholic edifices, as was customary of the Catholic Church during the ''[[Reconquista]]''. The Moors' Palace became the Castilian royal residence, and during [[Peter of Castile|Pedro I]]'s rule it was replaced by the Alcázar (the upper levels are still used by the [[Spanish royal family]] as the official Seville residence).

{{wide image|Seville panorama.jpg|700px|[[Seville Cathedral|Cathedral of Saint Mary]] from Constitución Avenue}}

In the [[Massacre of 1391|1391 pogrom]] against the Jews, believed to having been instigated by the Archdeacon [[Ferrant Martínez]], all the synagogues in Seville were converted to churches (renamed Santa María la Blanca, San Bartolomé, Santa Cruz, and Convento Madre de Dios). The Jewish quarter's land and shops (which were located in modern-day [[Santa Cruz, Seville|Santa Cruz neighbourhood]]) were appropriated by the church and many Jewish homes were burned down. 4000 Jews were killed during the pogrom and many others were [[B'nei Anusim|forced to convert]].

The first tribunal of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] was instituted in Seville in 1478. Its primary charge was to ensure that all nominal Christians were really behaving like Christians, and not practicing what Judaism they could in secret. At first, the activity of the Inquisition was limited to the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seville|Seville]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Córdoba|Córdoba]], where the Dominican friar, Alonso de Ojeda, had detected [[converso]] activity.<ref name = "ojeda">{{cite web | url = http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/longhurst2/06.html | title= The Age of Torquemada, Chapter 6, pg. 79 | last = Longhurst | first = john Edward | publisher = Coronado Press | date = 1 January 1964 | access-date = 22 August 2021}} Description of Dominican friar who agitated for the Spanish Inquisition.</ref> The first [[Auto-da-fé|Auto de Fé]] took place in Seville on 6 February 1481, when six people were burned alive.

===Early modern period===
Following the [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Columbian exploration]] of the [[New World]], Seville was chosen as headquarters of the [[Casa de Contratación]] in 1503, which was the decisive development for Seville becoming the port and gateway to the Indies.{{Sfn|Pérez-Mallaína|1997|p=15}} Unlike other harbors, reaching the port of Seville required sailing about {{convert|80|km}} up the River Guadalquivir. The choice of Seville was made in spite of the difficulties for navigation in the Guadalquivir stemming from the increasing [[tonnage]] of ships as a result of the relentless drive to make maritime transport cheaper during the late Middle Ages.{{Sfn|Pérez-Mallaína|1997|p=16}} Nevertheless, technical suitability issues notwithstanding, the choice was still reasonable in the sense that Seville had become the largest demographic, economic and financial centre of Christian Andalusia in the late Middle Ages.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/carav_1147-6753_1997_num_69_1_2753|title=Auge y decadencia del puerto de Sevilla como cabecera de las rutas indianas|year=1997|last=Pérez-Mallaína|first=Pablo E.|pages=15–16|journal=Caravelle.

A 'golden age of development' commenced in Seville, due to its being the only port awarded the royal monopoly for trade with [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish Americas]] and the influx of riches from them. Since only [[Winds in the Age of Sail|sailing ships]] leaving from and returning to the inland port of Seville could engage in trade with the Spanish Americas, merchants from Europe and other trade centers needed to be in Seville to acquire New World trade goods. The city's population grew to more than a hundred thousand people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://personal.us.es/alporu/histsevilla/poblacion.htm |title=Demografía de Sevilla en el siglo XVI|publisher=Seville University |access-date=23 July 2012}}</ref>

In the early 17th c., Seville's monopoly on overseas trade was broken, with the port of [[Cádiz]] now the monopoly port of trade as [[Siltation|silting]] of the Guadalquivir river in the 1620s made Seville's harbors harder to use.<ref name="Nash-2005">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vVA1reAI7w0C&q=history+of+seville&pg=PA1|title=Seville, Cordoba, and Granada: A Cultural History|last=Nash|first=Elizabeth|date=13 October 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518204-0|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://libro.uca.edu/payne1/payne15.htm|title=Chapter 15: A History of Spain and Portugal|website=libro.uca.edu|access-date=27 April 2019}}</ref> The [[Great Plague of Seville]] in 1649, exacerbated by excessive flooding of the Guadalquivir, reduced the population by almost half, and it did not recover until the early 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1999/6/99.06.01.x.html |title=99.06.01: Human-Environment Relations: A Case Study of Donana National Park, Andalucia, Spain and the Los Frailes Mine Toxic Spill of 1998 |website=Yale.edu |access-date=10 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nEuFAgAAQBAJ&q=seville+plague+1649&pg=PA38|title=Early Modern Spain: A Social History|last=Casey|first=James|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=978-1-134-62380-8|pages=37–38}}</ref> By the 18th century, Seville's international importance was in steep decline, after the monopoly port for the trade to the Americas was relocated to Cádiz. Cádiz had gifted the Bourbon claimant to the throne in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] funding that helped it pursue the war. The reward to Cádiz was the rights of the monopoly port. The [[Casa de Contratación|House of Trade]] (which registered ships, cargoes, and persons travelling to the New World), and the large scale overseas commercial enterprises of the [[Consulado de mercaders|merchant guild]] relocated to Cádiz. The House of Trade had been housed in rented quarters, but the purpose-built headquarters of the merchant guild was left vacant.<ref>Byron Ellsworth Hamann, ''The Invention of the Colonial Americas: Data, Architecture, and the Archive of the Indies, 1781-1844''. Los Angeles: Getty Publications 2022</ref>

During the monarchy of [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]], the [[Archive of the Indies]] was established in Seville in the old headquarters of the merchant guild. Documents pertaining to Spain's overseas empire were moved there from existing archival repositories, including [[Simancas]] and the House of Trade, were consolidated in a single repository. One scholar argues that the establishment of the Archive of the Indies marks a decisive moment in Spain's history, with the 18th c. Bourbon monarchy conceiving of its overseas territories as colonies of the metropole rather than entities under the jurisdiction of the crown on an equal basis as the kingdoms in the Iberian peninsula.<ref>Hamann, ''The Invention of the Colonial Americas: Data, Architecture, and the Archive of the Indies, 1781-1844'', 1</ref>

During the 18th century Charles III promoted Seville's industries. Construction of the [[Royal Tobacco Factory|''Real Fábrica de Tabacos'' (Royal Tobacco Factory)]] began in 1728.

More operas have been set in Seville than in any other city of Europe. In 2012, a study of experts concluded the total number of operas set in Seville is 153. Among the composers who fell in love with the city are [[Beethoven]] (''[[Fidelio]]''), [[Mozart]] (''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' and ''[[Don Giovanni]]''), [[Rossini]] (''[[The Barber of Seville]]''), [[Donizetti]] (''[[La favorite]]''), and [[Bizet]] (''[[Carmen]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.terratraditionsconsulting.com/the-explorador/traditions-culture/seville-and-the-opera/|title= Seville and the Opera, a true love affair|author= Mounielou, Jean Francois|publisher= Terra Traditions|date= 21 February 2017|access-date= 20 May 2018|archive-date= 22 May 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180522112814/https://www.terratraditionsconsulting.com/the-explorador/traditions-culture/seville-and-the-opera/}}</ref>

In the years that Queen [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabel II]] ruled directly, about 1843–1868, the Sevillian bourgeoisie invested in a construction boom unmatched in the city's history. The [[Puente de Isabel II|Isabel II bridge]], better known as the Triana bridge, dates from this period; street lighting was expanded in the municipality and most of the streets were paved during this time as well.<ref name=A>Diego A.

By the second half of the 19th century, Seville had begun an expansion supported by railway construction and the demolition of part of its ancient walls, allowing the urban space of the city to grow eastward and southward. The ''Sevillana de Electricidad'' Company was created in 1894 to provide electric power throughout the municipality,<ref>Fernández Paradas, Mercedes; ''[http://www.adurcal.com/enlaces/mancomunidad/historia/electri/electri.htm La implantación del alumbrado público de electricidad en la Andalucía del primer del tercio del S.

In 1929 the city hosted the [[Ibero-American Exposition of 1929|Ibero-American Exposition]], which accelerated the southern expansion of the city and created new public spaces such as the ''[[Parque de María Luisa]]'' (Maria Luisa Park) and the adjoining [[Plaza de España, Seville|''Plaza de España'']].

On 3 April 1979 Spain held its first democratic municipal elections after the end of Franco's dictatorship; councillors representing four different political parties were elected in Seville. On 5 November 1982, [[Pope John Paul II]] arrived in Seville to officiate at a Mass before more than half a million people at the fairgrounds.

In 1992, coinciding with the fifth centenary of the [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Discovery of the Americas]], the [[Seville Expo '92|Universal Exposition]] was held for six months in Seville, on the occasion of which the local communications network and urban infrastructure was greatly improved under a 1987 [[PGOU]] plan launched by Mayor [[Manuel del Valle]]:<ref name=abc>{{cite news |title=Muere Manuel del Valle, el exalcalde de Sevilla que rediseñó la ciudad |url=https://sevilla.abc.es/sevilla/sevi-muere-manuel-valle-exalcalde-sevilla-rediseno-ciudad-202003262158_noticia.html |work=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]] |date=27 March 2020 |access-date=14 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200414030349/https://sevilla.abc.es/sevilla/sevi-muere-manuel-valle-exalcalde-sevilla-rediseno-ciudad-202003262158_noticia.html |archive-date=14 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> the SE-30 ring road around the city was completed and new highways were constructed; the new [[Seville-Santa Justa railway station]] had opened in 1991, while the Spanish High-Speed Rail system, the ''[[Alta Velocidad Española]]'' (AVE), began to operate between Madrid-Seville. The [[Seville Airport]] was expanded with a new terminal building designed by the architect [[Rafael Moneo]], and various other improvements were made. The [[Puente del Alamillo|Alamillo Bridge]] and the [[Centenario Bridge]], both crossing over the Guadalquivir, also were built for the occasion. Some of the installations remaining at the site after the exposition were converted into the Scientific and Technological Park [[Cartuja 93]].

In 2004 the Metropol Parasol project, commonly known as ''Las Setas'' ('The Mushrooms'), due to the appearance of the structure, was launched to revitalise the ''Plaza de la Encarnación'', for years used as a car park and seen as a dead spot between more popular tourist destinations in the city.

==Geography==
===Location===
[[File:(Sevilla) Seville, Spain (49104522676) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Satellite imagery of Seville ([[Sentinel-2]], [[Copernicus Programme]], [[European Space Agency]])]]
[[File:MTN50-0984-2006-cns-Sevilla.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Seville sheet of MTN50 (Spain's National Topographic Map at 1:50,000 scale), at its first digital edition (year 2006).]]
Seville has an area of {{convert|141|km2|0|abbr=on}}, according to the National Topographic Map ''(Mapa Topográfico Nacional)'' series from the ''Instituto Geográfico Nacional&nbsp;– Centro Nacional de Información Geográfica'', the country's civilian survey organisation (pages 984, 985 and 1002). The city is situated in the fertile valley of the River Guadalquivir. The average height [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] is {{convert|7|m|0|abbr=off}}. Most of the city is on the east side of the river, while [[Triana, Seville|Triana]], [[La Cartuja, Seville|La Cartuja]] and [[Los Remedios, Seville|Los Remedios]] are on the west side. The [[Albaida del Aljarafe|Aljarafe]] region lies further west, and is considered part of the metropolitan area. The city has boundaries on the north with [[La Rinconada, Andalusia|La Rinconada]], [[La Algaba]] and [[Santiponce]]; on the east with [[Alcalá de Guadaira]]; on the south with [[Dos Hermanas]] and [[Gelves]] and on the west with [[San Juan de Aznalfarache]], [[Tomares]] and [[Camas, Seville|Camas]].

Seville is on the same [[37th parallel north|parallel]] as United States west coast city [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] in central California. [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]], the main island of the [[Azores]] archipelago, lies on the same latitude. Further east from Seville in the [[Mediterranean Basin]], it is on the same latitude as [[Catania]] in Sicily, Italy and just south of [[Athens]], the capital of [[Greece]]. Beyond that, it is located on the same parallel as South Korean capital, [[Seoul]]. Seville is located inland, not very far from the Andalusian coast, but still sees a much more continental climate than the nearest port cities, [[Cádiz]] and [[Huelva]]. Its distance from the sea makes summers in Sevilla much hotter than along the coastline.

==Main sights==
{{Main|Sights and landmarks of Seville}}
Seville is a big tourist centre in Spain. In 2018, there were over 2.5&nbsp;million travellers and tourists who stayed at a tourist accommodation, placing it third in Spain after Madrid and Barcelona. The city has an overall low level of seasonality, so there are tourists year-round.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Guaita Martínez |first1=José Manuel |last2=Martín Martín |first2=José María |last3=Salinas Fernández |first3=Jose Antonio |last4=Mogorrón-Guerrero |first4=Helena |title=An analysis of the stability of rural tourism as a desired condition for sustainable tourism |journal=Journal of Business Research |date=July 2019 |volume=100 |pages=165–174 |doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.03.033 |s2cid=159374518 |hdl=10481/87452 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> There are many landmarks, museums, parks, gardens and other kinds of tourist spots around the city so there is something for everyone. The Alcázar, the cathedral, and the [[General Archive of the Indies]] are UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s.

Many of the city's most important sights and monuments are located in the historic centre (Casco Antiguo). To the north of the centre is the Macarena neighbourhood, which contains some important monuments and religious buildings, such as the Museum and Catholic Church of ''La Macarena'' or the ''[[Hospital de las Cinco Llagas]]''. Across the river, on the west bank of the Guadalquivir, the neighbourhood of Triana had an important role in the history of the city.

=== Palaces and mansions ===
[[File:Salón de Embajadores, Real Alcázar de Sevilla.jpg|left|thumb|The ''Salón de Embajadores'' in the [[Alcázar of Seville]]]]
To the south of the cathedral, the Alcázar is a sprawling palace and garden complex which served as the city's center of power.

Some limited parts of the palace still date from its 12th-century expansion under Almohad rule, but most of the site was redeveloped after the Christian conquest of the city in the 13th century. A major construction campaign took place in the 1360s under Pedro I, who constructed a new palace in Mudéjar style, aided in part by craftsmen from Granada. Richly-decorated chambers and courtyards date from this period, such as the ''Patio de las Doncellas'' and the ''Salón de Embajadores''.<ref name="Bloom-2009" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ruggles |first=D.

The ''[[Torre del Oro]]'' is an Almohad defensive tower dating to 1220–1221.

It lines both Guadalquivir shores around the ''San Jerónimo'' [[meander]]. The 32-metres-high bronze sculpture, ''[[Birth of a New Man|The Birth of a New Man]]'' (popularly known as Columbus's Egg, ''el Huevo de Colón''), by the Georgian sculptor [[Zurab Tsereteli]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1994/09/08/056.html |title=ABC Hemeroteca |website=ABC|location=Spain |access-date=12 March 2012}}</ref> is located in its northwestern sector.
* The American Garden, also completed for Expo '92, is in [[La Cartuja]]. It is a public botanical garden, with a representative collection of American plants donated by different countries on the occasion of the world exposition. Despite its extraordinary botanical value, it remains a mostly abandoned place.

==Culture==
===Theatres===
[[File:Sevilla Casino de la Exposición.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lope de Vega Theatre (Seville)|Teatro Lope de Vega]]]]
The [[Lope de Vega Theatre (Seville)|Teatro Lope de Vega]] is located on Avenida de María Luisa avenue (next to ''Parque de María Luisa''). It was built in 1929, being its architect [[Vicente Traver y Tomás]]. It was the auditorium of the pavilion of the city in the Ibero-American Exhibition. This pavilion had a large room that became the Casino of the Exhibition. The theatre occupied an area of 4600 m<sup>2</sup> and could accommodate 1100 viewers. Its architecture is [[Spanish Baroque architecture|Spanish Baroque Revival]], being the building faithful to this style both in the set and in its ornamentation.

It has hosted varied performances, including theater, dance, opera, [[jazz]], and [[flamenco]] and nowadays the most outstanding of the panorama is its programming national and international, becoming one of the most important theatres in Spain.<ref>{{citation

Other important theatres are [[Teatro de la Maestranza]], Auditorio Rocío Jurado and Teatro Central.

Seville also has a [[corral de comedias]] theatre, which is the [[Corral del Coliseo]], now used as a residential building.

=== Festivals ===
There are many entertainment options around the city of Seville and one of its biggest attractions is the numerous festivals that happen around the year. Some of the festivals concentrate on religion and culture, others focus on the folklore of the area, traditions, and entertainment.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=12 July 2016|title=Seville, Spain|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A457876488/ITOF?sid=ITOF&xid=81c4569d|journal=Express Travel World|via=GaleGroup}}</ref>

[[File:17401532982 c1e3546763 o feria de abril 2012.jpg|thumb|right|''Casetas'' in the 2012 [[Seville Fair|Feria de Abril]]]]
The April Fair (''Feria de Abril'') is a huge celebration that takes place in Seville about two weeks after the Holy Week. It was previously associated with celebrating livestock; however, nowadays its purpose is to create a fun cheerful environment tied to the appreciation of the Spanish folklore.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Castillo-Manzano |first1=José I. |last2=López-Valpuesta |first2=Lourdes |last3=Marchena-Gómez |first3=Manuel |title=Seville: A city with two souls |journal=Cities |date=February 2015 |volume=42 |pages=142–151 |doi=10.1016/j.cities.2014.10.005 |hdl=11441/148837 |hdl-access=free }}</ref>

During the Feria, families, businesses, and organisations set up ''casetas'' ([[Tent#Marquees and larger tents|marquees]]) in which they spend the week dancing, drinking, and socialising. Traditionally, women wear elaborate flamenco dresses and men dress in their best suits. The marquees are set up on a permanent fairground in the district of Los Remedios,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploreseville.com/events/feriadeabril.htm |title=Feria de Abril, Seville |website=Exploreseville.com |access-date=12 March 2013}}</ref> in which each street is named after a famous bullfighter.

==== Salón Náutico Internacional de Sevilla ====
The International Boat Show of Seville is an annual event that takes place in the only inland maritime port of the country, which is one of the most important in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|title=The first Seville Boat Show arrives in June |url=https://www.barcheamotore.com/seville-boat-show-arrives-in-june/?lang=en|website=barcheamotore.com|date = 8 April 2019}}</ref>

Seville had a vibrant rock music scene in the 1970s and 1980s<ref>{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0015/001592/159293E.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0015/001592/159293E.pdf |archive-date=9 October 2022 |url-status=live |title=Seville: UNESCO City of Music |publisher=UNESCO |date=2007 |access-date=13 February 2018}}</ref> with bands like [[Triana (band)|Triana]], [[Alameda (band)|Alameda]] and [[Smash (British band)|Smash]], who fused Andalusia's traditional flamenco music with British-style progressive rock. The punk rock group [[Reincidentes]] and indie band [[Sr Chinarro]], as well as singer [[Kiko Veneno]], rose to prominence in the early 1990s. The city's music scene now features rap acts such as [[SFDK (band)|SFDK]], [[Mala Rodríguez]], [[Dareysteel]], [[Tote King]], [[Dogma Crew]], [[Bisley DeMarra]], [[:es:Haze (MC)|Haze]] and [[Jesuly]]. Seville's diverse music scene is reflected in the variety of its club-centred nightlife.

The city is also home to many theatres and performance spaces where classical music is performed, including [[Teatro Lope de Vega, Seville|Teatro Lope de Vega]], [[Teatro La Maestranza]], Teatro Central, the [[Real Alcazar Gardens]] and the Sala Joaquín Turina.

Despite its name, the [[sevillana]] dance, commonly presented as flamenco, is not thought to be of Sevillan origin. However, the folksongs called ''[[sevillanas]]'' are authentically Sevillan, as is the four-part dance performed with them.

On 19 November 2023, Seville hosted the [[24th Annual Latin Grammy Awards]] at the [[FIBES Conference and Exhibition Centre]], making Seville the first city outside of the [[United States]] to host the [[Latin Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://apnews.com/article/seville-spain-cf8138523aa769cc6bbde83acdd80ee4 |title=Latin Grammys to be held in Spain, leaving US for 1st time|work=Associated Press News |date=22 February 2023 |access-date=11 May 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/news/2023-latin-grammys-sevilla-spain-24th-awards |title=2023 Latin Grammys To Host First-Ever International Telecast In Sevilla, Spain, On Nov. 16; Nominations To Be Announced Sept. 19 |publisher=Recording Academy Grammy Awards |last=Ochoa |first=John |date=4 May 2023 |access-date=11 May 2023}}</ref>

{{Main|Flamenco}}
[[File:8714202852_f852db384b_o_feria_de_abril.jpg|thumb|upright|Flamenco costume during [[Seville Fair]]]]
The [[Triana, Seville|Triana]] district in Seville is considered a birthplace of flamenco, where it found its beginning as an expression of the poor and marginalized. Seville's Gypsy population, known as Flamencos, were instrumental in the development of the art form. While it began as and remains a representation of Andalusian culture, it has also become a national heritage symbol of Spain.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ruiz|first1=Ana|title=Vibrant Andalusia: The spice of life in southern Spain|date=2007|publisher=Algora Publ|location=New York|isbn=978-0-87586-539-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Joshua|title=Flamenco capital: Tradition, revolution and renewal in Seville, Spain|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3010g01h|publisher=UC Riverside|access-date=28 February 2018|year=2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Washabaugh|first1=William|title=Flamenco music and national identity in Spain|date=2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd|location=Farnham|isbn=978-1-4094-3485-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Manuel|first1=Peter|s2cid=191384305|title=Andalusian, Gypsy, and class identity in the contemporary flamenco complex|journal=Ethnomusicology|volume=33|issue=1|pages=47–65|doi=10.2307/852169|jstor=852169|year=1989|url=https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1535&context=jj_pubs }}</ref> There are more flamenco artists in Seville than anywhere else in the country, supporting an entire industry surrounding it and drawing in a significant amount of tourism for the city.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Aoyama|first1=Yuko|s2cid=144812906|title=Artists, tourists, and the state: Cultural tourism and the flamenco industry in Andalusia, Spain|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|date=March 2009|volume=33|issue=1|pages=80–104|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2009.00846.x}}</ref>

===Gastronomy===
[[File:Gazpacho Cazuela Barro.jpg|thumb|left|Andalusian [[Gazpacho]]]]
The ''[[tapas]]'' scene is one of the main cultural attractions of the city: people go from one bar to another, enjoying small dishes called tapas (literally "lids" or "covers" in Spanish, referring to their probable origin as snacks served on small plates used to cover drinks). Local specialities include fried and grilled seafood (including [[squid]], ''choco'' ([[cuttlefish]]), [[swordfish]], marinated [[Squalidae|dogfish]], and ''[[Snakelocks anemone#Gastronomy|ortiguillas]]''), grilled and stewed meat, [[spinach]] with [[chickpea]]s, ''[[Jamón ibérico]]'', lamb kidneys in sherry sauce, [[Land snail#Snails as human food|snails]], ''[[puchero|caldo de puchero]]'', and ''[[gazpacho]]''. A sandwich known as a ''[[serranito]]'' is the typical and popular version of fast food.

Typical desserts from Seville include ''pestiños'', a honey-coated sweet fritter; ''torrijas'', fried slices of bread with honey; ''roscos fritos'', deep-fried sugar-coated ring doughnuts; ''magdalenas'' or fairy cakes; ''yemas de San Leandro'', {{citation needed|date=February 2013}} which provide the city's [[convent]]s with a source of revenue; and ''[[tortas de aceite]]'', a thin sugar-coated cake made with olive oil. ''Polvorones'' and ''mantecados'' are traditional Christmas products, whereas ''pestiños'' and ''torrijas'' are typically consumed during the [[Holy Week in Seville|Holy Week]].

Bitter [[Seville orange]]s grow on trees lining the city streets. Large quantities are collected and exported to Britain to be used in [[marmalade]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Wright|first=Fraser|date=22 January 2016|title=A history of Seville Orange Marmalade, including a recipe for making your own|url=https://foodanddrink.scotsman.com/food/a-history-of-seville-orange-marmalade-including-a-recipe-for-making-your-own/|access-date=17 June 2020|website=Scotsman Food and Drink|language=en-US}}</ref> Locally, the fruit is used predominantly in aromatherapy, herbal medicine, and dietary diet products, rather than as a foodstuff.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Padilla|first=Brenda|date=3 May 2013|title=Gastronomy - Seville Oranges|url=https://www.andalucia.com/gastronomy/oranges/seville.htm|access-date=17 June 2020|website=Andalucia.com|language=en}}</ref> According to legend, the Arabs brought the bitter orange to Seville from East Asia via Iraq around the 10th century to beautify and perfume their patios and gardens, as well as to provide shade.<ref name="Nash200514">{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Nash|title=Seville, Cordoba, and Granada:A Cultural History: A Cultural History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vVA1reAI7w0C&pg=PA14|access-date=8 February 2013|date=2005|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-518204-0|page=14}}</ref> The flowers of the tree are a source of [[neroli oil]], commonly used in [[perfumery]] and in skin lotions for massage.

In 2021, the municipal water company, Emasesa, began a pilot scheme to use the methane produced as the fruit ferments to generate clean electricity. The company plans to use 35 tonnes of fruit to generate clean energy to power one of the city's water purification plants.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Burgen|first=Stephen|date=23 February 2021|title='A role model': how Seville is turning leftover oranges into electricity|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/23/how-seville-is-turning-leftover-oranges-into-electricity|access-date=24 February 2021|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Avenida de la Constitucion Sevilla.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Avenida de la Constitución]]
Seville is the most populated city in southern Spain, and has the largest GDP (gross domestic product) of any in Andalusia,<ref name="ABC de Sevilla">{{cite web|url= http://www.abcdesevilla.es/hemeroteca/historico-20-02-2005/sevilla/Andalucia/sevilla-aporta-la-cuarta-parte-del-pib-y-es-la-capital-economica-de-andalucia_20734816682.html|archive-url= https://archive.today/20130213034945/http://www.abcdesevilla.es/hemeroteca/historico-20-02-2005/sevilla/Andalucia/sevilla-aporta-la-cuarta-parte-del-pib-y-es-la-capital-economica-de-andalucia_20734816682.html|archive-date= 13 February 2013|title= Sevilla aporta la cuarta parte del PIB y es la capital económica de Andalucía|publisher= ABC de Sevilla|date= 20 February 2005}}</ref> accounting for one-quarter of its total GDP.<ref name="ABC de Sevilla"/> All municipalities in the metropolitan area depend directly or indirectly on Seville's economy, while agriculture dominates the economy of the smaller villages, with some industrial activity localised in industrial parks. The ''Diputación de Sevilla'' (Deputation of Seville), with provincial headquarters in the Antiguo Cuartel de Caballería (Old Cavalry Barracks) on Avenida Menendez Pelayo, provides public services to distant villages that they can not provide themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dipusevilla.es/actualidad/noticias/noticia_0553.html|title=Rodríguez Villalobos afirma que los pequeños municipios necesitan una figura supramunicipal para poder prestar servicios públicos|publisher=Diputación de Sevilla|access-date=24 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706221108/http://www.dipusevilla.es/actualidad/noticias/noticia_0553.html|archive-date=6 July 2012}}</ref>

The economic activity of Seville cannot be detached from the geographical and urban context of the city; the capital of Andalusia is the centre of a growing metropolitan area. Aside from traditional neighbourhoods such as Santa Cruz, Triana and others, those further away from the centre, such as [[Nervión, Seville|Nervión]], Sevilla Este, and El Porvenir have seen recent economic growth. Until the economic crisis of 2007, this urban area saw significant population growth and the development of new industrial and commercial parks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Atlas de la provincia de Sevilla|url=http://3web.dipusevilla.es/atlasnuevo/inicio2.htm|work=Map:Innovación tecnológica|publisher=Diputación de Sevilla, Junta de Andalucía|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623070103/http://3web.dipusevilla.es/atlasnuevo/inicio2.htm|archive-date=23 June 2013}}</ref>

During this period, availability of infrastructure in the city contributed to the growth of an economy dominated by the service sector,<ref>{{cite web|title=Atlas de la provincia de Sevilla|url=http://3web.dipusevilla.es/atlasnuevo/inicio2.htm|work=Map:Empleo en el sector terciario|publisher=Diputación de Sevilla, Junta de Andalucía|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623070103/http://3web.dipusevilla.es/atlasnuevo/inicio2.htm|archive-date=23 June 2013}}</ref> but in which industry still holds a considerable place.<ref>{{cite web|title=Atlas de la provincia de Sevilla|url=http://3web.dipusevilla.es/atlasnuevo/5_industria/industrial/imagenes/25actividad_industrial_400000.pdf|work=Map:Industrial actividad|publisher=Diputación de Sevilla, Junta de Andalucía|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704120550/http://3web.dipusevilla.es/atlasnuevo/5_industria/industrial/imagenes/25actividad_industrial_400000.pdf|archive-date=4 July 2012}}</ref>

===Infrastructure===
[[File:Centro Comercial Torre Sevilla (3).jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Cajasol Tower|Sevilla Tower]] on the Isla de La Cartuja, designed by the architect [[César Pelli]]]]
The 1990s saw massive growth in investment in infrastructure in Seville, largely due to its hosting of the [[Seville Expo '92|Universal Exposition of Seville]] in 1992. This economic development of the city and its urban area is supported by good transportation links to other Spanish cities, including a high-speed [[AVE]] railway connection to Madrid, and a new international [[San Pablo Airport|airport]].

Seville has the only inland port in Spain, located {{convert|80|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the mouth of the River Guadalquivir. This harbour complex offers access to the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and allows trade in goods between the south of Spain (Andalusia, [[Extremadura]]) and Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. The port has undergone reorganisation. Annual [[tonnage]] rose to 5.3&nbsp;million tonnes of goods in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.apsevilla.com/wps/portal/estadistica |title=Autoridad Portuaria de Sevilla |language=es |website=Portal.apsevilla.com |date=1 January 1980 |access-date=24 November 2016 |archive-date=25 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125110156/http://portal.apsevilla.com/wps/portal/estadistica }}</ref>

[[Cartuja 93]] is a research and development park,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartuja93.es |title=PCTCartuja – Inicio |website=Cartuja93.es |access-date=24 November 2016}}</ref> employing 15,000 persons.

Outside of Seville are nine [[PS20 solar power towers]] which use the city's sunny weather to provide most of it with clean and renewable energy.

The [[Sevilla Tower]] skyscraper was started in March 2008 and was completed in 2015. With a height of {{convert|180.5|m|abbr=off}} and 40 [[Storey|floors]], it is the tallest building in [[Andalusia]].

Seville has conference facilities, including the [[FIBES Conference and Exhibition Centre|Conference and Convention Centre]].

===Research and development===
The ''Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas en Sevilla'' (CSIC) is based in the former [[Peruvian pavilion, Seville|Pavilion of Peru]] in the [[Maria Luisa Park]].

The output of the research centres in Sevillan universities working in tandem with city government, and the numerous local technology companies, have made Seville a leader among Spanish cities in technological [[research and development]]. The ''Parque Científico Tecnológico Cartuja 93'' is a nexus of private and public investment in various fields of research.<ref name="MonclúsFraga2006">{{cite book|author1=Francisco Javier Monclús|author2=Francisco Javier Monclús Fraga|title=Exposiciones internacionales y urbanismo: El proyecto Expo Zaragoza 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2d6KJ2VnfAkC|access-date=6 February 2013|year=2006|publisher=Univ.

==Transport==

===Bus===
Seville is served by the TUSSAM [http://www.tussam.es/ (Transportes Urbanos de Sevilla)] [[transit bus|bus]] network which runs buses throughout the city. The Consorcio de Transportes de Sevilla communicates by bus with all the satellite towns of Seville.

Two bus stations serve transportation between surrounding areas and other cities: ''Plaza de Armas'' Station, with destinations north and west, and ''Prado de San Sebastián'' Station, covering routes to the south and east. ''Plaza de Armas'' station has direct bus lines to many Spanish cities as well as [[Lisbon]], Portugal.

===Metro===
The [[Seville Metro]] ("Metro de Sevilla" in Spanish) is a light metro network serving the city of Seville and its [[metropolitan area]]. The system is totally independent of any other rail or street traffic. All stations were built with [[platform screen doors]].

It was the sixth Metro system to be built in Spain, after those in [[Madrid Metro|Madrid]], [[Barcelona Metro|Barcelona]], [[Valencia Metro (Spain)|Valencia]], [[Metro Bilbao|Bilbao]] and [[Palma de Mallorca Metro|Palma de Mallorca]]. Currently, it is the fifth-biggest Metro company in Spain by the number of passengers carried (more than 12,000,000 in 2009).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jesse|first=Russell|title=List of Seville Metro Stations|publisher=Book on Demand Pod}}</ref>

The metro of Sevilla has 1 line with 22 stations and is currently expanding, with 3 more different lines projected.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

===Tram===
[[File:Sevilla-3-16_(48040473632).jpg|thumb|[[MetroCentro (Seville)|MetroCentro]]]]
[[MetroCentro (Seville)|MetroCentro]] is a surface tramway serving the centre of the city. It began operating in October 2007.

The service has just five stops: Plaza Nueva, Archivo de Indias, Puerta de Jerez, Prado de San Sebastián and San Bernardo, all as part of ''Phase I'' of the project. It is expected to be extended to Santa Justa [[Alta Velocidad Española|AVE]] station, including four new stops: San Francisco Javier, Eduardo Dato, Luis de Morales, and Santa Justa. This extension was postponed although the City Council had made expanding the metro lines a priority.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Train===
The [[Seville-Santa Justa railway station]] is served by the [[AVE]] [[high-speed rail]] system, operated by the Spanish state-owned rail company [[Renfe]]. A five-line commuter rail service (''[[Cercanías Sevilla|Cercanías]]'') joins the city with the Metropolitan area. Seville is on the Red Ciudades AVE, a net created with Seville connected to 17 major cities of Spain with [[high-speed rail]].

Although Seville is close to the Portuguese city of [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]], it is not possible to cross the border by train.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/from-seville-to-faro#train |title=Is there any train from Seville to Faro, Portugal? |website=Travelinho.com |access-date=25 September 2018 |archive-date=25 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925215841/https://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/from-seville-to-faro#train |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Bicycle===
[[File:Sevici.jpg|thumb|[[Sevici]] Bicycle station]]
The Sevici [[community bicycle program]] has integrated bicycles into the public transport network. Bicycles are available for hire around the city at low cost, and green curb-raised bicycle lanes can be seen on most major streets. The number of people using bicycles as a means of transport in Seville has increased substantially in recent years, multiplying tenfold from 2006 to 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Seville goes Dutch|url=http://lcc.org.uk/pages/seville-goes-dutch|publisher=London Cycling Campaign|access-date=22 May 2014|archive-date=22 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522221305/http://lcc.org.uk/pages/seville-goes-dutch}}</ref> {{As of|2015}}, an estimated 9 percent of all mechanized trips in the city (and 5.6 percent of all trips including those on foot) are made by bicycle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Research on the use of bicycles in the city of Seville, 2013|url=http://bicicletas.us.es/?page_id=1341|publisher=SIBUS|access-date=22 May 2014|archive-date=22 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522220650/http://bicicletas.us.es/?page_id=1341|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The city council signed a contract with the multinational corporation [[JCDecaux]], an outdoor advertising company. The public bicycle rental system is financed by a local advertising operator in return for the city signing over a 10-year licence to exploit citywide billboards. The overall scheme is called Cyclocity<ref>{{cite web|title=The self-service bicycle sheme by JCDecaux|url=http://en.cyclocity.com/Cities/Cyclocity-in-the-world/Cyclocity-cities|publisher=JCDecaux|access-date=9 February 2013|date=20 December 2012}}</ref> by [[JCDecaux]], but each city's system is branded under an individual name.

As of 2022, some companies in the [[e-bike]] [[community bicycle program]] industry such as [[Lime (transportation company)]] and [[Ridemovi]] started working in the city,<ref>{{cite web|title=Sevilla estrena un servicio de alquiler de 2.000 bicicletas eléctricas por toda la ciudad|date=2 February 2022 |url=https://www.diariodesevilla.es/sevilla/bicicletas-electricas-Sevilla-servicio-alquiler-Ayuntamiento-Lime-Ridemovi_0_1653135072.html|publisher=Diario de Sevilla}}</ref> thanks to the new parking spots made by the [[City Council of Seville]]
