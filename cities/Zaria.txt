==History==
[[File:Zaria 130085145 08d4889953.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Guard at the palace of the emir]]
Zaria, initially known as [[Zazzau]], was the capital of the [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa kingdom]] of Zazzau.<ref name="britannica" />  Zazzau is thought to have been founded in or about 1536 and in the late 16th century it was renamed after Queen [[Amina (Queen of Zazzau)|Amina]]'s sister, Zaria.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Zaria-Nigeria|title=Zaria {{!}} Nigeria|newspaper=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-11-05}}</ref> Human settlement predates the rise of Zazzau, as the region, like some of its neighbors, had a history of sedentary Hausa settlement, with institutional market exchange and farming.

Zaria was the most southern of the Hausa city-states. It was a trading destination for Saharan caravans as well as a prominent city in the Hausa slave trade. In the late 1450s, Islam arrived in Zaria by the way of its sister Habe cities, [[Kano (city)|Kano]] and [[Katsina]].  Along with [[Islam]], trade flourished between the cities as traders brought camel caravans filled with salt in exchange for slaves and grain. The city-state's power peaked under Queen [[Amina (Queen of Zazzau)|Amina]] whose military campaigns established a tributary region including the kingdoms of [[Sultanate of Kano|Kano]] and [[Katsina]]. At the end of the 16th century, after Queen Amina's death, Zaria fell under the influence of the [[Jukun people (West Africa)|Jukun]] Kingdom and eventually became a tributary state itself.<ref name="britannica" /> Between the fifteenth and sixteenth century the kingdom became a tributary state of the [[Songhai Empire]]. In 1805 it was captured by the [[Fula people|Fulani]] during the [[Fulani Jihad]]. British forces led by [[Frederick Lugard]] took the city in 1901.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Zaria Town in Kaduna Nigeria Guide |url=https://www.nigeriagalleria.com/Nigeria/States_Nigeria/Kaduna/History-of-Zaria-in-Kaduna-State.html |access-date=2023-05-15 |website=www.nigeriagalleria.com}}</ref>[[File:Ambassador Ahmed Nuhu Bamalli.jpg|thumb|Emir of Zazzau                                                                   AMB.

Because Zaria is north of the rail junction at [[Kaduna]], it has equal rail access to the seaports at [[Lagos]] and [[Port Harcourt]]. However, only the railway between Lagos and Kano is functional, as the eastern line of [[Rail transport in Nigeria|Nigeria's rail network]] is not operational. This means that Zaria currently has rail access to Lagos and [[Kano (city)|Kano]] to the north but not Port Harcourt.<ref name=":7">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21364541|title=Can Nigeria's renovated railway unite north and south?|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=13 February 2013|access-date=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21571481-renovated-railway-line-welcome-more-are-still-sorely-needed-slow|title=Trains in Nigeria: A slow but steady new chug |publisher=The Economist|date=9 February 2013|access-date=4 March 2014}}</ref>
