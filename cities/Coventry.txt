Coventry became an important and wealthy city of national importance during the [[Middle Ages]]. Later it became an important industrial centre, becoming home to a large [[bicycle]] industry in the 19th century. In the 20th century, it became a major centre of the [[British motor industry]]; this made it a target for German [[The Blitz|air raid]]s during the [[Second World War]], and in November 1940, much of the historic city centre was destroyed by a [[Coventry Blitz|large air raid]].

The city was rebuilt after the war, and the motor industry thrived until the mid-1970s. However, by the late-1970s/early-1980s, Coventry was in an economic crisis, with one of the country's highest levels of unemployment due to major plant closures and the collapse of the respective local supply-chain. In recent years, it has seen regeneration and an increase in population. The city also has three universities: [[Coventry University]] in the city centre, the [[University of Warwick]] on the southern outskirts and the smaller [[Private university|private]] [[Arden University]] with its headquarters close to [[Coventry Airport]]. In addition, Coventry was awarded [[UK City of Culture]] for 2021.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-42272675|title=UK City of Culture 2021: Coventry wins|date=7 December 2017|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|access-date=7 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207193837/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-42272675|archive-date=7 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=LLoyd|first=Matt|date=27 July 2020|title=Inspirational film launches new City of Culture brand|url=https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/inspirational-film-charting-coventrys-history-18664093|access-date=18 August 2020|website=CoventryLive|archive-date=30 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200730053136/https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/inspirational-film-charting-coventrys-history-18664093|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Uncommon's modular Coventry City of Culture identity references the city's brutalist history|url=https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/uncommon-coventry-city-of-culture-identity-graphic-design-280720|access-date=18 August 2020|website=itsnicethat.com|archive-date=6 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806222740/https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/uncommon-coventry-city-of-culture-identity-graphic-design-280720|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
<!-- NOTE: this is intended to be a summary of Coventry's history. Please put detailed history in the main History of Coventry article -->
{{Main|History of Coventry}}

===Origins and toponymy===
The [[Roman Britain|Romans]] founded a large [[fort]] on the outskirts of what is now Coventry at [[Baginton]], next to the [[River Sowe]], it has been excavated and partially reconstructed in modern times and is known as the [[Lunt Fort]]. The fort was probably constructed around AD 60 in connection with the [[Boudican revolt]], and then inhabited sporadically until around 280 AD.<ref name="Lunt UoW">{{cite web |title=The Development and History of Lunt Fort |url=https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/classics/warwickclassicsnetwork/romancoventry/resources/lunt/development/ |publisher=University of Warwick |access-date=4 September 2022}}</ref>

The origins of the present settlement are obscure, but Coventry probably began as an [[Anglo-Saxon]] settlement. Although there are various theories of the origin of the name, the most widely accepted is that it was derived from ''Cofa's tree''; derived from a Saxon landowner called ''Cofa'', and a tree which might have marked either the centre or the boundary of the settlement.{{sfn|Walters|2019|pp=11–14}}

===Medieval===

Around {{circa| AD&nbsp;700}} a Saxon nunnery was founded here by [[St Osburg's Church, Coventry|St Osburga]],<ref>[http://www.historiccoventry.co.uk/history/history.php#arden Coventry's beginnings in the Forest of Arden] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101003627/http://www.historiccoventry.co.uk/history/history.php#arden |date=1 January 2012 }} Retrieved 29 September 2008</ref> which was later left in ruins by [[Canute the Great|King Canute's]] invading [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish]] army in 1016.{{sfn|Walters|2019|pp=11–14}} [[Leofric, Earl of Mercia]] and his wife [[Lady Godiva]] built on the remains of the nunnery and founded a [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[monastery]] in 1043 dedicated to St Mary.<ref>{{harvnb|Fox|1957|p=3}}</ref><ref>[http://www.coventrycathedral.org.uk/History.html The history of Coventry Cathedral on the cathedral's website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014182646/http://www.coventrycathedral.org.uk/History.html |date=14 October 2008 }} Retrieved on 28 September 2008</ref> It was during this time that the [[Lady Godiva#Legend|legend]] of Lady Godiva riding naked on horseback through the streets of Coventry, to protest against unjust taxes levied on the citizens of Coventry by her husband, was alleged to have occurred. Although this story is regarded as a myth by modern historians, it has become an enduring part of Coventry's identity.{{sfn|Walters|2019|pp=16–20}}

A market was established at the abbey gates and the settlement expanded. At the time of the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066, Coventry was probably a modest sized town of around 1,200 inhabitants, and its own [[Minster (church)|minster]] church.{{sfn|Walters|2019|pp=11–14}}

[[Coventry Castle]] was a [[motte and bailey castle]] in the city. It was built in the early 12th&nbsp;century by [[Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester]]. Its first known use was during [[The Anarchy]] when [[Robert Marmion (died 1144)|Robert Marmion]], a supporter of [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]], expelled the monks from the adjacent [[St Mary's Priory and Cathedral|priory of Saint Mary]] in 1144, and converted it into a fortress from which he waged a battle against the castle which was held by the Earl. Marmion perished in the battle.<ref>Davis, R. H. C., and Robert Bearman. "An Unknown Coventry Charter." The English Historical Review, vol. 86, no. 340, 1971, pp. 535.

The Bishops of [[Anglican Bishopric of Lichfield|Lichfield]] were often referred to as the Bishops of Coventry and Lichfield, or Lichfield and Coventry (from 1102 to 1541), and in the medieval period Coventry was a major centre of pilgrimage of religion.<ref>{{cite web |last=Berry |first=Karen |title=Coventry's history |url=https://www.coventry.gov.uk/local-history-heritage/coventrys-history |access-date=7 June 2024 |website=Coventry City Council }}</ref> The [[Benedictines]], [[Carthusians]], [[Carmelites]] and [[Franciscans]] all had religious houses in the city of Coventry.

Coventry claimed the [[city status in the United Kingdom|status of a city]] by [[time immemorial|ancient prescriptive usage]], and was granted a [[royal charter|charter of incorporation]] and [[coat of arms]] by [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]] in 1345.

===Tudor period===
[[File:Fords Hospital Almshouse - Coventry.jpg|thumb|Ford's Hospital Almshouse.]]
In 1506 the draper Thomas Bond founded [[Bond's Hospital]], an [[almshouse]] in Hill Street, to provide for 10 poor men and women.<ref>{{cite web |title=History {{!}} Bond's and Ford's Hospital |url=https://bondshospital.org/history/ |access-date=7 September 2024 |website=bondshospital.org}}</ref><ref>[https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/warks/vol2/pp109-112#h3-0004 "Hospitals: Coventry Pages 109–112 A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 2".] ''British History Online''.

Throughout the Middle Ages Coventry had been home several [[monastery|monastic]] orders and the city was badly hit by [[Henry VIII]]'s [[dissolution of the monasteries]]. Between 1539 and 1542, monasteries, priories and other properties belonging to the [[Whitefriars, Coventry|Carmelites]], [[Greyfriars, Coventry|Greyfriars]], [[Benedictine]]s and [[Carthusian]]s, were either sold off or dismantled. The greatest loss to the city was of Coventry's first Cathedral, [[St Mary's Priory and Cathedral]] which was mostly demolished, leaving only ruins, making it the only English Cathedral to be destroyed during the dissolution. Coventry would not have another Cathedral until 1918, when the parish [[Coventry Cathedral|church of St Michael]] was elevated to Cathedral status, and it was itself destroyed by enemy bombing in 1940. Coventry therefore has had the misfortune of losing its Cathedral twice in its history.{{sfn|Walters|2019|pp=82–85, 160}}

[[William Shakespeare]], from nearby [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], may have witnessed plays in Coventry during his boyhood or 'teens', and these may have influenced how his plays, such as ''Hamlet'', came about.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Nicoll|editor-first1=Allardyce|title=Shakespeare in his own age|date=1976|publisher=Cambridge university press|location=Cambridge [etc.]|isbn=9780521291293|edition=Repr.|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/shakespeareinhis0000unse}}</ref>

===Civil War and aftermath===
[[File:Swanswell Gate.jpg|thumb|Swanswell Gate, one of the remaining fragments of Coventry's city walls.]]
During the [[English Civil War]] Coventry became a bastion of the [[Roundheads|Parliamentarians]]: In August 1642, a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] force led by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] attacked Coventry. After a two-day battle, however, the attackers were unable to breach the city walls, and the city's garrison and townspeople successfully repelled the attack, forcing the King's forces to withdraw. During the [[Second English Civil War|Second Civil War]] many Scottish Royalist prisoners were held in Coventry; it is thought likely that the idiom "[[sent to Coventry]]", meaning to [[ostracise]] someone, derived from this period, owing to the often hostile attitude displayed towards the prisoners by the city folk.{{sfn|Walters|2019|pp=103–106}}

Following the [[Stuart Restoration|restoration of the monarchy]], as punishment for the support given to the Parliamentarians, [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] ordered that the city's walls be [[Slighting|slighted]] (damaged and made useless as defences) which was carried out in 1662.{{sfn|Walters|2019|pp=110–111}}

===Industrial age===
[[File:Daimler_Grafton_Phaeton_1897.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Daimler Company|Daimler]] Grafton Phaeton; one of the earliest cars to be built in Coventry in 1897.]]In the 18th and early 19th centuries, silk [[ribbon]] [[weaving]] and [[watch]] and [[clock]] making became Coventry's staple industries. In the 1780s, the silk ribbon weaving industry was estimated to employ around 10,000 weavers in Coventry, and its surrounding towns like [[Bedworth]] and [[Nuneaton]]. Coventry's growth was aided by the opening of the [[Coventry Canal]] in 1769, which gave the city a connection to the growing national canal network. Nevertheless, during the 18th century, Coventry lost its status as the Midlands' most important city to nearby [[Birmingham]], which overtook Coventry in size.{{sfn|Walters|2019|pp=119–121}} During the same period, Coventry became one of the three main British centres of [[watch]] and [[clock]] manufacture and ranked alongside [[Prescot]], in [[Lancashire]] and [[Clerkenwell]] in London.<ref name="cwm">{{cite web |url=http://www.coventrywatchmuseum.co.uk |title=Coventry Watch Museum Project |publisher=Coventry Watch Museum |access-date=14 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401015139/https://www.coventrywatchmuseum.co.uk/ |archive-date=1 April 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coventrykid.com/My%20Suddens%20Branches.htm|title=John Suddens, watchmaker|access-date=25 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211214110/http://coventrykid.com/My%20Suddens%20Branches.htm|archive-date=11 February 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> By the 1850s, Coventry had overshadowed its rivals to become the main centre of British watch and clock manufacture, which by that time employed around 2,000 people. The watch and clock industry produced a pool of highly skilled craftsmen, who specialised in producing precision components.{{sfn|Walters|2019|pp=128–129, 143}}

The ribbon weaving and clock industries however both rapidly collapsed after 1860, due to cheap imports following the [[Cobden–Chevalier Treaty|Cobden–Chevalier free trade treaty]], which flooded the market with cheaper [[France|French]] silks, and [[Swiss Made]] clocks and watches. For a while, this caused a devastating slump in Coventry's economy.{{sfn|Walters|2019|pp=143–144}}

A second wave of industrialisation, however, began soon after. Coventry's pool of highly skilled workers attracted [[James Starley]], who set up a company producing [[sewing machines]] in Coventry in 1861. Within a decade, he became interested in [[bicycles]], and developed the [[penny-farthing]] design in 1870. His company soon began producing these bicycles, and Coventry soon became the centre of the British bicycle industry. Further innovation came from Starley's nephew, [[John Kemp Starley]], who developed the [[Rover Company|Rover]] [[safety bicycle]], the first true modern bicycle with two equal-sized wheels and a chain drive in 1885.{{sfn|Walters|2019|pp=145–150}} By the 1890s Coventry had the largest bicycle industry in the world, with numerous manufacturers, however bicycle manufacture went into steady decline from then on, and ended entirely in 1959, when the last bicycle manufacturer in the city relocated.<ref name="CTbicycle">{{cite web |last1=Mullen |first1=Enda |title=When Coventry was the world's 'bicycle city' |date=9 December 2018 |url=https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/coventy-bicycle-industry-history-15526405 |publisher=Coventry Telegraph |access-date=4 January 2023}}</ref>

By the late-1890s, bicycle manufacture began to evolve into [[automobile|motor]] manufacture. The first [[motor car]] was made in Coventry in 1897, by the [[Daimler Company]]. Before long Coventry became established as one of the major centres of the [[British motor industry]].{{sfn|Walters|2019|pp=145–150}} In the early-to-mid 20th century, a number of famous names in the British motor industry became established in Coventry, including [[Alvis Car and Engineering Company|Alvis]], [[Armstrong Siddeley]], [[Daimler Company|Daimler]], [[Humber Limited|Humber]], [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]], [[Riley Motor|Riley]], [[Rootes Group|Rootes]], [[Rover Company|Rover]], [[Singer Motors|Singer]], [[Standard Motor Company|Standard]], [[Swift Motor Company|Swift]] and [[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph]].<ref name="BHOLcraftsandindustry">{{cite web |title=The City of Coventry: Crafts and industries, Modern industry and trade |url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/warks/vol8/pp162-189#h3-0011 |publisher=British History Online |access-date=12 November 2022}}</ref>  For most of the early-20th century, Coventry's economy boomed; in the 1930s, a decade otherwise known for its [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|economic slump]], Coventry was noted for its affluence. In 1937 Coventry topped a national purchasing power index, designed to calculate the purchasing power of the public.{{sfn|Walters|2019|pp=161–162}}

=== Great War (1914–1918) ===
[[File:Monument in War Memorial Park in Coventry 14g06.jpg|thumb|Cenotaph at the War Memorial Park.]]

===Urban expansion and development===
[[File:Coventry_Broadgate_1917.jpg|thumb|left|Broadgate, Coventry, in 1917]]

With many of the city's older properties becoming increasingly unfit for habitation, the first [[Council housing|council houses]] were let to their tenants in 1917. With Coventry's industrial base continuing to soar after the end of the [[World War I|Great War]] in 1918, numerous private and council housing developments took place across the city in the 1920s and 1930s to provide housing for the large influx of workers who came to work in the city's booming factories. The areas which were expanded or created in this development included [[Radford, Coventry|Radford]], [[Coundon, Coventry|Coundon]], [[Canley]], [[Cheylesmore]] and [[Stoke Heath, Coventry|Stoke Heath]].{{sfn|Walters|2019|pp=153–169}} [[File:Coventry being redeveloped in 1936.jpg|thumb|Coventry city centre being redeveloped in 1936 during modernisation]]

As the population grew, the city boundaries underwent several expansions, in 1890, 1928, 1931 and 1965,<ref name="BHOLintro">{{cite web |title=The City of Coventry: Introduction |url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/warks/vol8/pp1-23#h3-0002 |publisher=British History Online |access-date=30 March 2023}}</ref> and between 1931 and 1940 the city grew by 36%.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hunt |first=Cathy |title=A History of Women's Lives in Coventry. |date=2018 |publisher=[[Pen & Sword]] |isbn=9781526708526 }}</ref>

The development of a southern by-pass around the city, starting in the 1930s and being completed in 1940, helped deliver more urban areas to the city on previously rural land. In the 1910s plans were created to redevelop Coventry's narrow streets and by the 1930s the plans were put into action with Coventry's medieval street of Butcher Row being demolished.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-24934919 | title=How medieval Coventry was lost, say historians | work=BBC News | date=14 November 2013 | access-date=9 June 2022}}</ref> even before the war, the plans had been put in place to destroy the medieval character of Coventry.<ref>{{cite news |date=14 November 2013 |title=How medieval Coventry was lost, say historians |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-24934919 |access-date=14 April 2024 |work=BBC News }}</ref>

The [[London Road Cemetery]] was designed by [[Joseph Paxton]] on the site of a former quarry to meet the needs of the city.

===German bombing of Coventry===
{{main|Coventry Blitz}}
[[File:Coventry bomb damage H5600.jpg|thumb|Coventry city centre after the massive air raid of 14/15 November 1940]]

Coventry suffered severe bomb damage during the [[Second World War]]. The most severe was a massive [[Luftwaffe]] [[Strategic bombing|air raid]] that the Germans called Operation Moonlight Sonata. The raid, which involved more than 500 aircraft, started at 7pm on 14 November 1940 and carried on for 11 hours into the morning of 15 November. The raid led to severe damage to large areas of the city centre and to [[Coventry Cathedral|Coventry's historic cathedral]], leaving only a shell and the spire. More than 4,000 houses were damaged or destroyed, along with around three quarters of the city's industrial plants. Between 380 and 554 people were killed, with thousands injured and homeless.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/15/newsid_3522000/3522785.stm|title=BBC ON THIS DAY / 15 / 1940: Germans bomb Coventry to destruction|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=15 November 1940|access-date=2 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118111802/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/15/newsid_3522000/3522785.stm|archive-date=18 November 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

Aside from London, [[Hull Blitz|Hull]] and [[Plymouth Blitz|Plymouth]], Coventry suffered more damage than any other British city during the Luftwaffe attacks, with huge firestorms devastating most of the city centre. The city was probably targeted owing to its high concentration of armaments, munitions, aircraft and aero-engine plants which contributed greatly to the British war effort, although there have been claims that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] launched the attack as revenge for the bombing of [[Munich]] by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] six days before the Coventry Blitz and chose the Midlands city because its medieval heart was regarded as one of the finest in Britain.<ref>{{cite news |last=Morris |first=Steven |date=9 October 2009 |title=Coventry blitz: was destruction of medieval centre Hitler's revenge? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/09/coventry-blitz-hitler-revenge |access-date=28 June 2024 |work=The Guardian |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Following the raids, the majority of Coventry's historic buildings were demolished by a council who saw no need of them in a modern city, although some of them could have been repaired and some of those demolished were unaffected by the bombing.

===Post-Second World War===
[[File:Belvedere over Coventry.png|thumb|A helicopter placing the [[Flèche (architecture)|Flèche]] (spire) on top of the new Coventry Cathedral in 1962.]]

====Redevelopment====
In the post-war years Coventry was largely rebuilt under the general direction of the [[Donald Gibson (architect)|Gibson Plan]], gaining a new pedestrianised shopping precinct (the first of its kind in Europe on such a scale) and in 1962 Sir [[Basil Spence]]'s much-celebrated new [[Coventry Cathedral|St Michael's Cathedral]] (incorporating one of the world's largest tapestries) was consecrated. Its prefabricated steel spire (flèche) was lowered into place by helicopter.{{sfn|Walters|2019|pp=170–186}}

Further housing developments in the private and public sector took place after the Second World War, partly to accommodate the growing population of the city and also to replace condemned and bomb damaged properties. Several new suburbs were constructed in the post-war period, including [[Tile Hill]], [[Wood End, Coventry|Wood End]], and [[Stoke Aldermoor]].{{sfn|Walters|2019|pp=170–186}}

====Boom and bust====

Coventry's motor industry boomed during the 1950s and 1960s and Coventry enjoyed a 'golden age'. In 1960 over 81,000 people were employed in the production of motor vehicles, tractors and aircraft in Coventry.<ref name="BHOLcraftsandindustry"/> During this period the disposable income of Coventrians was amongst the highest in the country and both the sports and the arts benefited. A new sports centre, with one of the few Olympic standard swimming pools in the UK, was constructed and [[Coventry City Football Club]] reached the First Division of English Football. The [[Belgrade Theatre]] was also constructed along with the [[Herbert Art Gallery]]. Coventry's pedestrianised Precinct shopping area came into its own and was considered one of the finest retail experiences outside London. In 1965 the new [[University of Warwick]] campus was opened to students, and rapidly became one of the country's leading higher-education institutions.{{sfn|Walters|2019|pp=170–186}}

Coventry's large industrial base made it attractive to the wave of [[South Asians in the United Kingdom|Asian]] and [[Caribbean]] immigrants who arrived from [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] colonies after 1948. In 1950, one of Britain's first [[mosque]]s—and the very first in Coventry—was opened on Eagle Street to serve the city's growing Pakistani community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/coventry.html|title=A brief history of Coventry|work=localhistories.org|first=Tim|last=Lambert|access-date=21 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810131029/http://www.localhistories.org/coventry.html|archive-date=10 August 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The 1970s, however, saw a decline in the British motor industry and Coventry suffered particularly badly, especially towards the end of that decade. By the 1970s, most of Coventry's motor companies had been absorbed and rationalised into larger companies, such as [[British Leyland]] and [[Chrysler Europe|Chrysler]] which subsequently collapsed. The [[early 1980s recession]] dealt Coventry a particularly severe blow: By 1981, Coventry was in an economic crisis, with one in six of its residents unemployed. By 1982, the number of British Leyland employees in the city had fallen from 27,000 at its height, to just 8,000. Other Coventry industrial giants such as the tool manufacturer [[Alfred Herbert (company)|Alfred Herbert]] also collapsed during this time.{{sfn|Walters|2019|pp=170–186}}

In the late-1970s and early-1980s, Coventry also became the centre of the [[Two-tone (music genre)|Two-tone]] musical phenomena. The two-tone style was multi-racial, derived from the traditional [[Jamaican music]] genres of [[ska]], [[reggae]] and [[rocksteady]] combined with elements of [[punk rock]] and [[New wave music|new wave]]. Bands considered part of the genre include [[the Specials]], [[the Selecter]], [[Madness (band)|Madness]], [[The Beat (British band)|the Beat]], [[Bad Manners]], [[The Bodysnatchers (band)|the Bodysnatchers]] and [[Akrylykz]]. Most famously the Specials 1981 UK no.1 hit '[[Ghost Town (The Specials song)|Ghost Town]]' reflected the unemployment and desolation of Coventry at the time.<ref>{{cite web |title=Coventry, from 2 Tone Ghost Town to City of Culture |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/may/28/coventry-2-tone-ghost-town-uk-city-of-culture |work=The Guardian |access-date=2 April 2023 |date=28 May 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=This article is more than 2 years old The Guardian view on two-tone nostalgia: the pride of Coventry |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/11/the-guardian-view-on-two-tone-nostalgia-the-pride-of-coventry |work=The Guardian |date=11 February 2021 |access-date=2 April 2023}}</ref>

===21st century===
Some motor manufacturing continued into the early 21st century: The research and design headquarters of [[Jaguar Cars]] is in the city at their [[Whitley plant]] and although vehicle assembly ceased at the [[Browns Lane plant]] in 2004, Jaguar's head office returned to the city in 2011, and is also sited in Whitley. Jaguar is owned by the Indian company, [[Tata Motors]]. The closure of the [[Peugeot]] factory at [[Ryton-on-Dunsmore]] in 2006, ended volume car manufacture in Coventry.{{sfn|Walters|2019|pp=170–186}} By 2008, only one motor manufacturing plant was operational, that of LTI Ltd, producing the popular [[TX4]] taxi cabs. On 17 March 2010 LTI announced they would no longer be producing bodies and chassis in Coventry, instead producing them in [[People's Republic of China|China]] and shipping them in for final assembly in Coventry.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/transport/article7066364.ece|title=Manganese Bronze: Black cabs on the road to China|last=Lea|first=Robert|date=18 March 2010|work=The Times|location=London|access-date=3 April 2010|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708065701/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/transport/article7066364.ece|archive-date=8 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Since the 1980s, Coventry has recovered, with its economy diversifying into services, with engineering ceasing to be a mass employer, what remains of manufacturing in the city is driven by smaller more specialist firms. By the 2010s the biggest drivers of Coventry's economy had become its two large universities; the [[University of Warwick]] and [[Coventry University]], which between them, had 60,000 students, and a combined annual budget of around £1 billion.{{sfn|Walters|2019|pp=170–186}}

In 2021 Coventry became the [[UK City of Culture]]. A range of artistic and local history events and projects took place over the next year, including "Coventrypedia" and the creation of the [https://coventryatlas.org/ Coventry Atlas] local history map.

===City boundaries===
Coventry forms the largest part of the [[Coventry and Bedworth Urban Area]]. The city proper covers an area of almost {{convert|100|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

The protected [[West Midlands Green Belt]], which surrounds the city on all sides, has prevented the expansion of the city into both the administrative county of [[Warwickshire]] and the metropolitan borough of [[Solihull]] (the [[Meriden Gap]]), and has helped to prevent the coalescence of the city with surrounding towns such as [[Kenilworth]], [[Nuneaton]], [[Leamington Spa]], [[Warwick]] and [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] as well as the large village of [[Balsall Common]].

===Places of interest===
====Cathedral====
The spire of the ruined cathedral forms one of the ''"three spires"'' which have dominated the city skyline since the 14th&nbsp;century, the others being those of [[Greyfriars, Coventry|Christ Church]] (of which only the spire survives) and [[Holy Trinity Church, Coventry|Holy Trinity Church]] (which is still in use).
[[File:Coventry Cathedral Ruins with Rainbow edit.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of the old cathedral]]
[[Coventry Cathedral|St Michael's Cathedral]] is Coventry's best-known landmark and visitor attraction. The 14th&nbsp;century church was largely destroyed by German bombing during the [[Second World War]], leaving only the outer walls and spire. At {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=off}} high, the spire of St Michael's is claimed to be the third tallest cathedral spire in England, after [[Salisbury Cathedral|Salisbury]] and [[Norwich Cathedral|Norwich]].<ref>Arthur Mee, The King's England – Warwickshire; Hodder & Stoughton, 1936</ref> Due to the architectural design (in 1940 the tower had no internal wooden floors and a stone vault below the belfry) it survived the destruction of the rest of the cathedral. 
[[File: St Michael's Coventry Cathedral - the nave.jpg |upright|thumb|left| The new nave with ''[[Christ in Glory in the Tetramorph]]'' tapestry]]
The new Coventry Cathedral was opened in 1962 next to the ruins of the old. It was designed by Sir [[Basil Spence]]. The cathedral contains the tapestry ''[[Christ in Glory in the Tetramorph]]'' by [[Graham Sutherland]]. The bronze statue ''[[St Michael's Victory over the Devil]]'' by [[Jacob Epstein]] is mounted on the exterior of the new cathedral near the entrance. [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[War Requiem]]'', regarded by some as his masterpiece, was written for the opening of the new cathedral.<ref>[http://www.brittenpears.org/?page=britten/works/requiem.html Britten-Pears Foundation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923194647/http://www.brittenpears.org/?page=britten%2Fworks%2Frequiem.html |date=23 September 2015 }} Retrieved 24 September 2009</ref> The cathedral was featured in the 2009 film ''[[Nativity!]]''.<ref name="nativity">{{cite news|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/2009/10/23/nativity-movie-could-make-coventry-a-big-star-this-christmas-92746-24995014/|title=Nativity movie could make Coventry a big star this Christmas|newspaper=[[Coventry Telegraph]]|first=Marion|last=McMullen|date=23 October 2009|access-date=2 August 2012}}</ref>

Coventry Cathedral is also notable for being one of the newest [[cathedral]]s in the world, having been built following the Second World War bombing of the ancient cathedral by the Luftwaffe. Coventry has since developed an international reputation as one of Europe's major cities of peace and reconciliation,<ref name="Cov reconcil">{{cite web |url=http://www.coventry.gov.uk/ccm/content/chief-executives-directorate/corporate-policy/international-team/coventry-peace-month/coventry-city-of-peace-and-reconciliation.en |title=Peace and reconciliation |publisher=Coventry City Council |access-date=16 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315182225/http://www.coventry.gov.uk/ccm/content/chief-executives-directorate/corporate-policy/international-team/coventry-peace-month/coventry-city-of-peace-and-reconciliation.en |archive-date=15 March 2007}}</ref> centred on its cathedral, and holds an annual Peace Month.<ref name="Cov peace month">{{cite web |url=http://www.coventry.gov.uk/ccm/navigation/community-and-living/international-links/coventry-peace-month/ |title=Coventry Peace Month |publisher=Coventry City Council |access-date=16 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316002020/http://www.coventry.gov.uk/ccm/navigation/community-and-living/international-links/coventry-peace-month/ |archive-date=16 March 2007}}</ref> John Lennon and Yoko Ono planted two acorns outside the cathedral in June 1968 to thank the city for making friends with others.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/content/articles/2008/05/28/john_yoko_feature.shtml |title=Fifty acorns tied in a sack... |work=bbc.co.uk |access-date=18 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325195421/http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/content/articles/2008/05/28/john_yoko_feature.shtml |archive-date=25 March 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Coventry also has a Baptist church named [[Queens Road Baptist Church, Coventry|Queens Road Baptist Church]], which was first established in 1723 and moved to its current building in 1884.

====Cultural institutions====
[[File:Herbert Art Gallery ^ Museum extension, Coventry - geograph.org.uk - 4870561.jpg|thumb|Herbert Art Gallery.]]
The [[Herbert Art Gallery and Museum]] is one of the largest cultural institutions in Coventry. Another visitor attraction in the city centre is [[Coventry Transport Museum]], which has the largest public collection of British-made road vehicles in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transport-museum.com|title=Coventry Transport Museum|website=www.transport-museum.com|access-date=14 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906063348/http://www.transport-museum.com/|archive-date=6 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The most notable exhibits are the world speed record-breaking cars, [[Thrust2]] and [[ThrustSSC]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transport-museum.com/visiting/biffa_award_land_speed_record_exhibition.aspx|title=Biffa Award Land Speed Record Exhibition – Coventry Transport Museum|website=www.transport-museum.com|access-date=14 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910075722/http://www.transport-museum.com/visiting/biffa_award_land_speed_record_exhibition.aspx|archive-date=10 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The museum received a refurbishment in 2004 which included the creation of a new entrance as part of the city's Phoenix Initiative project. It was a finalist for the 2005 [[Gulbenkian Prize]].  
[[File:Coventry Transport Museum (1).jpg|thumb|Coventry Transport Museum.]]
Historic Coventry Trust (previously known as The Charterhouse Coventry Preservation Trust) was founded in 2011. The Trust is a social enterprise aiming to regenerate Coventry's historic buildings and landscapes. Their sites across Coventry include the [[The Charterhouse, Coventry|Charterhouse]], the two surviving City Gates, [[Drapers' Hall, Coventry|Drapers' Hall]], [[London Road Cemetery]]: [[Joseph Paxton|Paxton's]] Arboretum and Priory Row.<ref>{{cite web |title=Visit |url=https://www.historiccoventrytrust.org.uk/visit/ |access-date=7 June 2024 |website=Historic Coventry Trust }}</ref>

The £5 million [[Fargo Village]] creative quarter shopping precinct was open in 2014 on Far Gosford Street with a mixture of retail units.

About {{convert|4|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} from the city centre and just outside Coventry in [[Baginton]] is the [[Lunt Fort]], a reconstructed [[Roman Empire|Roman]] fort on its original site. The [[Midland Air Museum]] is situated just within the perimeter of Coventry on land adjacent to [[Coventry Airport]] and near [[Baginton]].

Coventry was one of the main centres of watchmaking during the 18th and 19th&nbsp;centuries and as the industry declined, the skilled workers were key to setting up the cycle trade. A group of local enthusiasts founded the Coventry Watch Museum in [[Spon Street]].<ref name=cwm/>

[[File:West Midlands Police - Coventry Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Exhibits in Coventry Police Museum]]

The city's main [[police station]] in Little Park Street also hosts a museum of Coventry's police force. The museum, based underground, is split into two sections—one representing the history of the city's police force, and the other compiling some of the more unusual, interesting and grisly cases from the force's history. The museum is funded from charity donations—viewings can be made by appointment.

[[Hillfields#Coventry City Farm|Coventry City Farm]] was a small farm in an urban setting. It was mainly to educate city children who might not get out to the countryside very often. The farm closed in 2008 due to funding problems.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/coventry_warwickshire/7291402.stm |title=City farm shuts after cash crisis |date=12 March 2008 |access-date=28 March 2008 |work=BBC News Online |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321045232/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/coventry_warwickshire/7291402.stm |archive-date=21 March 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Coventry Council House coat of arms over entrance.jpg|thumb|Coat of Arms of Coventry above the Council House.]]
Traditionally a part of [[Warwickshire]] (although it was [[County of the City of Coventry|a county in its own right]] for 400 years), Coventry became an independent [[county borough]] in 1889. It later became a [[metropolitan district]] of the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands county]] under the [[Local Government Act 1974]], even though it was entirely separate to the Birmingham conurbation area (this is why Coventry appears to unnaturally "jut out" into Warwickshire on political maps of the UK). In 1986, the [[West Midlands County Council]] was abolished and Coventry became administered as an effective [[unitary authority]] in its own right.

Coventry is administered by [[Coventry City Council]], controlled since 2010 by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and led since May 2016 by George Duggins.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/coventry-city-council-leader-ann-11297241|title=Coventry City Council leader Ann Lucas ousted in Labour Party coup|date=6 May 2016|work=Coventry Telegraph|access-date=10 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509013848/http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/coventry-city-council-leader-ann-11297241|archive-date=9 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The city is divided up into 18 [[ward (politics)|Wards]] each with three [[councillor]]s. The chairman of the [[Coventry City Council|council]] is the [[Lord Mayor of Coventry|Lord Mayor]], who has a casting vote.

Certain local services are provided by West Midlands wide agencies including the [[West Midlands Police]], the [[West Midlands Fire Service]] and [[Transport for West Midlands]] (Centro) which is responsible for [[public transport]].

In 2006, Coventry and Warwickshire Ambulance Service was merged with the [[West Midlands Ambulance Service]]. The Warwickshire and Northamptonshire [[Air Ambulance]] service is based at [[Coventry Airport]] in Baginton.

Coventry is represented in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] by three [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Members of Parliament]] (MPs). They are:
* [[Mary Creagh]] – ([[Coventry East (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry East]])
* [[Zarah Sultana]] – ([[Coventry South (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry South]])
* [[Taiwo Owatemi]] – ([[Coventry North West (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry North West]])

Up until 1997, Coventry was represented by four Members of Parliament, whereupon the Coventry South West and Coventry South East constituencies were merged to form Coventry South.

On Tuesday, 10 September 2024, Zarah Sultana, the Member of Parliament for Coventry South, was suspended from the Labour Party for voting in favour of a [[Scottish National Party]] amendment to end the [[Benefit cap|two child benefit cap]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-09-11 |title=Coventry MP warns winter fuel cuts could have fatal consequences |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y51zzpd6po |access-date=2024-10-24 |website=BBC News |language=en-GB}}</ref>

===Literature and drama===
* The African American actor [[Ira Aldridge]] managed Coventry Theatre after impressing the people of the city with his acting during a tour in 1828. He was born in New York in 1807, but moved to England when he was18, and is considered the UK's first black Shakespearean performer.<ref>{{cite news |date=3 August 2017 |title=First black Shakespearean actor Ira Aldridge honoured |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-40802072 |access-date=6 June 2024 |work=BBC News }}</ref> 
* The poet [[Philip Larkin]] was born and brought up in Coventry,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/content/articles/2009/06/02/philip_larkin_feature.shtml|title=Larkin around Coventry|work=bbc.co.uk|access-date=18 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924203228/http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/content/articles/2009/06/02/philip_larkin_feature.shtml|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> where his father was the City Treasurer.
* During the early 19th&nbsp;century, Coventry was well known due to author [[George Eliot]] who was born near [[Nuneaton]], Warwickshire. The city was the model for her famous novel ''[[Middlemarch]]'' (1871).
* The [[Coventry Carol]] is named after the city of Coventry. It was a carol performed in the play ''The Pageant of the Shearman and Tailors'', written in the 15th&nbsp;century as one of the [[Coventry Mystery Plays|Coventry Cycle Mystery Plays]]. These plays depicted the nativity story, the lyrics of the Coventry Carol referring to the [[Annunciation]] to the [[Massacre of the Innocents]], which was the basis of the Pageant of the Shearmen and Tailors. These plays were traditionally performed on the steps of the (old) cathedral. The [[Belgrade Theatre]] brought back the Coventry Mystery Plays in 2000 to mark the city's millennium celebrations: the theatre now produces the Mystery Plays every three years.
* The [[Belgrade Theatre]] was Britain's first purpose-built civic theatre, opened in 1958. In 1965 the world's first ''Theatre-in-Education'' (TiE) company was formed to develop theatre as a way of inspiring learning in schools. The TiE movement spread worldwide, the theatre still offers a number of programmes for young people across Coventry and has been widely recognised as a leader in the field. It was reopened in 2007 following a period of refurbishment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belgrade.co.uk/about-us/history/|title=History|work=Belgrade Theatre|access-date=18 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129170901/http://www.belgrade.co.uk/about-us/history/|archive-date=29 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>
* Novelist [[Graham Joyce]], winner of the [[O. Henry Award]] is from [[Keresley]]. His [[World Fantasy Award]]-winning novel "[[The Facts of Life (Joyce novel)|The Facts of Life]]" is set in Coventry during the blitz and in the post-war rebuilding period.
* The playwright Alan Pollock<ref>{{cite web |title= Alan Pollock Interview|url=https://www.whatsonlive.co.uk/shropshire/interviews/alan-pollock-interview/15327|access-date=4 May 2022}}</ref> was brought up in Coventry. Other playwrights associated with the city include Nick Walker and Chris O'Connell – founder of the city's Theatre Absolute.
* Brian Saunders lived in Coventry and was featured, along with his partner Andrew Stuart Sutton and Pete and Les Cardy, in the series A Place In Greece in 2004 and 2005.

[[File:Coventry city flag.svg|thumb|Coventry flag]]
The Coventry Flag,<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|url=https://www.flaginstitute.org/wp/flags/coventry-flag/|title=Coventry Flag |publisher= UK Flag Registry|access-date=8 June 2023}}</ref> designed by Simon Wyatt,<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/coventry-flag-city-of-culture-15516206|title=Look: One of these six designs is Coventry's new flag|first=Elis|last=Sandford|date=7 December 2018|website=CoventryLive|access-date=8 June 2023}}</ref> was adopted through a popular vote on 7 December 2018. The Coventry Flag represents the unique identity of the Warwickshire city and its residents. It emerged as the winner in a competition organised by [[BBC CWR|BBC Coventry & Warwickshire]]<ref name="auto"/> and proudly flew during Coventry's tenure as the UK City of Culture in 2021. The design features [[Lady Godiva]], a local heroine, depicted in black on a white pale, symbolising Coventry's history, principles, and its reputation as a city of peace. Sky blue panels on either side of Lady Godiva represent "Coventry Blue," reminiscent of the historic local textile industry and Coventry City Football Club, known as the "Sky Blues."

On the sporting scene, [[Coventry R.F.C.|Coventry Rugby Football Club]] was consistently among the nation's leading rugby football sides from the early 20th&nbsp;century, peaking in the 1970s and 1980s.

===Football===
[[File:Ricoh Arena, Coventry (stand and pitch) 14s07.jpg|thumb|Ricoh Arena.]]
There are two professional [[association football|football]] teams representing the city: [[Coventry City F.C.]] of the [[EFL Championship]] in men's football and [[Coventry United L.F.C.|Coventry United]] L.F.C. of the [[FA Women's Championship]] in women's football.

[[Coventry City F.C.]], formed in 1883 as "Singers F.C.". Nicknamed the ''Sky Blues'', the club competes in the [[EFL Championship]] (second tier of English football), but spent 34 years from 1967 to 2001 in the top tier of English football, winning the [[FA Cup]] in 1987. They were founder members of the [[Premier League]] in 1992. In 2005, Coventry City moved to the 32,600 capacity [[Ricoh Arena]] which opened in the Rowleys Green district of the city. The 2013–14 season saw the football club begin a ground share with [[Northampton Town F.C.]] at [[Sixfields Stadium]], [[Northampton]], which lasted until their return to the Ricoh Arena in September 2014. The 2019–20 season saw the Sky Blues once again playing their home fixtures out of Coventry, at [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City's]] [[St Andrew's (stadium)|St Andrew's Stadium]]. This arrangement continued until August 2021, when Coventry moved back to the newly renamed Coventry Building Society Arena.

Coventry United L.F.C. play at the Butts Park Arena and were originally Coventry City Ladies before the Sky Blues discontinued their women's team, at which point they affiliated with Coventry United, and rose through the divisions to their current position in the second-tier of the women's game.

Aside from these clubs, there are several other clubs in the city playing non-league football. [[Coventry Sphinx]], [[Coventry Alvis F.C.|Coventry Alvis]], [[Coventry Copsewood]] and [[Coventry United]] all play in the [[Midland Football League (2014)|Midland Football League]].

Both [[Coventry University]] and the [[University of Warwick]] compete in the [[British Universities and Colleges Sport]] (BUCS) football competitions. For the 2014–15 season, the Coventry University men's 1st team compete in BUCS Midlands 1a, while the University of Warwick men's 1st team competes in BUCS Midlands 2a. Both institutions' women's 1st teams both play in BUCS Midlands 2a.

===Rugby Union===
At the beginning of the 2014–15 season, there were 14 clubs based in Coventry, playing at various levels of the [[English rugby union system]]. However, on 21 December 2014, this rose to 15, when [[English Premiership (rugby union)|Aviva Premiership]] club [[Wasps RFC]] played their first home game at the [[Ricoh Arena]], completing their relocation to the city. This followed Wasps' purchase of Arena Coventry Limited (the company which runs the [[Ricoh Arena]]). The club announced that they will build a new 'state of the art' training complex in the area by 2016.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/29631938 |title = Wasps confirm opening Ricoh Arena fixture |date = 15 October 2014 |work = BBC Sport |publisher = BBC |access-date = 15 December 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141213011113/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/29631938 |archive-date = 13 December 2014 |url-status = live }}</ref>

Wasps' stay in the City ended in 2022 after the club collapsed into administration and were forced to relinquish their ownership of the arena.<ref>{{cite news |date=17 October 2022 |title=Wasps: 167 job losses as Premiership club follow Worcester Warriors into administration |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/63244504 |access-date=11 June 2024 |work=BBC Sport }}</ref> As it stands, Wasps currently have no plans to play in Coventry again.

[[Coventry R.F.C.|Coventry Rugby Football Club]] play in the [[RFU Championship]], the second tier of the English [[rugby union]] system. The club enjoyed national success during the 1950s, the 1960s and 1970s, with many of its players playing for their countries, notable players include [[Ivor Preece]], [[Peter Jackson (rugby union)|Peter Jackson]], [[David Duckham]], [[Fran Cotton]] and [[Danny Grewcock]]. From 1921 to 2004, the club played at Coundon Road Stadium. Their current home ground is the [[Butts Park Arena]], which was opened in 2004.

[[Broadstreet Rugby Club|Broadstreet R.F.C]] are the only other club to play in a 'National league' currently playing in [[National Division 2 North]].

There are a further 12 clubs playing in the [[Rugby Football Union Midland Division|Midland divisions]] of the [[Rugby Football Union|English Rugby Union]] system. In 2015, they included Barkers Butts RFC, Dunlop RFC, Earlsdon RFC, Pinley, Old Coventrians, Coventrians, Coventry Welsh, Stoke Old Boys RFC, Copsewood RFC, Keresley RFC, [[Old Wheatleyans RFC]] and Trinity Guild RFC.

Both [[Coventry University]] and the [[University of Warwick]] compete in the British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS) Rugby competitions.

===Rugby League===
[[Midlands Hurricanes]] are the major [[rugby league]] team in the city. Originally known as Coventry Bears, the Hurricanes compete in the [[RFL League 1|Betfred League 1]], as a semi-professional team in the third tier of the game. They play their home matches at the [[Butts Park Arena]].

In 2002, the club won the [[Rugby League Conference]], and took the step up to the national leagues. In 2004, they won the National Division 3 title and have appeared in the [[Challenge Cup]]. In 2015 the Bears entered their reserve team into the [[Conference League South]] league, a level below the first team under the name [[Coventry Bears Reserves]] playing home games at the Xcel Leisure Centre.

Both [[Coventry University]] and the [[University of Warwick]] compete in the British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS) Midlands 1a competition.

===Speedway===
Coventry Speedway was based at [[Brandon Stadium]] (also known as [[Coventry Stadium]]). The stadium is located just outside the city in the village of [[Brandon, Warwickshire|Brandon]], [[Warwickshire]] ({{convert|6|mi|abbr=off}} to the east of the city). The stadium operated both sides of the Second World War. Before the Second World War [[Motorcycle speedway|speedway]] also operated for a short time at [[Lythalls Lane Stadium|Foleshill Stadium]], off Lythalls Lane in the city. Between 1998 and 2000, Coventry Stadium hosted the [[Speedway Grand Prix of Great Britain]].

The [[Coventry Bees]] started in 1948 and have operated continuously until the end of the 2018 season. They started out in the National League Division Three before moving up to the Second Division and, later to the top flight. The Bees were crowned League Champions on nine occasions (1953, 1968, 1978, 1979, 1987, 1988, 2005, 2007 and 2010).

Amongst the top speedway riders who represented Coventry teams were [[Tom Farndon]], [[Jack Parker (speedway rider)|Jack Parker]], [[Arthur Forrest (speedway rider)|Arthur Forrest]], [[Nigel Boocock]], [[Kelvin Tatum]], [[Chris Harris (speedway rider)|Chris Harris]], [[Scott Nicholls]], [[Emil Sayfutdinov]] and [[Speedway World Championship|World Champions]] [[Ole Olsen (speedway rider)|Ole Olsen]], [[Hans Nielsen (speedway rider)|Hans Nielsen]], [[Greg Hancock]], [[Billy Hamill]], [[Ronnie Moore (speedway rider)|Ronnie Moore]] and [[Jack Young (speedway rider)|Jack Young]].

In 2007, the Bees won the domestic speedway treble of Elite League, Knock-out Cup and Craven Shield, while Chris Harris won both the [[Speedway Grand Prix of Great Britain]] and the British Championship. The Bees retained the Craven Shield in 2008, and Chris Harris added further British Championship victories in both 2009 and 2010. The Elite League Championship Trophy returned to Brandon in 2010 when the Bees convincingly beat [[Poole Pirates]] in the play-off finals.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/motorbikes/speedway/9062265.stm |title = Coventry Bees crowned Elite League champions |date=5 October 2010 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |access-date=5 October 2010}}</ref>

The [[Coventry Storm]], an offshoot of the senior team, competed in the [[National League (Speedway)|National League]].

In 2017, the stadium became unavailable for motorsports, with new owners Brandon Estates pursuing planning permission for housing – thus, neither Coventry team was able to compete in the leagues, although a number of challenge matches were undertaken on opposition teams' tracks.

For 2018, Coventry Bees were entered into the National League, the third tier of British Speedway, riding their home meetings at the Paul Chapman and Sons Arena, Beaumont Park, Leicester – the home of Leicester Lions. The team has not operated since then.

===Ice hockey===

==Economy==
[[File:Coventry Skyline.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Coventry's skyline (view from the footbridge over the railway by Central 6 shopping centre). The three spires are: [[Holy Trinity Church, Coventry|Holy Trinity]] (left), remaining spire of the ruined (bombed) [[Coventry Cathedral|cathedral]] and the remaining spire of the ruined Christ Church (right).]]

Historically, Coventry was the most important seat of ribbon-making in the UK. In this industry it competed locally with [[Norwich]] and [[Leicester]] and internationally with [[Saint-Étienne]] in France.

Coventry has been a centre of motor and cycle manufacturing. Starting with [[The Coventry Motor Company|Coventry Motette]], [[The Great Horseless Carriage Company]], [[Swift Motor Company]], [[Humber Limited|Humber]], [[Hillman]], [[Riley (automobile)|Riley]], [[Francis-Barnett]] and [[Daimler Company|Daimler]] and the [[Triumph Motorcycles Ltd|Triumph motorcycle]] having its origins in 1902 in a Coventry factory. The [[Massey Ferguson]] tractor factory was situated on [[Banner Lane]], [[Tile Hill]], until it closed in the late 1990s.

Although the motor industry has declined almost to the point of extinction, the [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]]
company has retained its corporate headquarters in the city (at Whitley) and an Advanced R&D team at the University of Warwick, while [[Peugeot]] still have a large parts centre in Humber Road despite the closure of its [[Ryton plant|Ryton factory]] (formerly owned by the [[Rootes Group]]) just outside the city in December 2006 with the loss of more than 2,000 jobs – denting the economy of Coventry shortly before the onset of a [[Late 2000s recession|recession]] which sparked further economic decline and high unemployment.

[[File:1972 Hillman Avenger 1.5.jpg|thumb|A 1972 [[Hillman Avenger]], produced in Coventry by Chrysler Competitions Department]]

The [[Standard Motor Company]] opened a car factory at [[Canley]] in the south of the city in 1918, occupying a former munitions factory. This site was later expanded and produced Triumph cars after the Standard brand was phased out by [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]] during the 1960s. In August 1980, however, it was closed down as part of [[British Leyland|British Leyland's]] rationalisation process, although the Triumph brand survived for another four years on cars produced at other British Leyland factories. The closure of the Triumph car factory was perhaps the largest blow to Coventry's economy during the early 1980s economic decline.

The famous London [[Hackney carriage|black cab taxis]] are produced by Coventry-based [[London Electric Vehicle Company|LEVC]] (formerly [[London Taxis International|LTI]]); until its 2017 relocation from the historic Holyhead Road factory to a new plant at [[Ansty, Warwickshire|Ansty Park]] a few miles outside the city, these were the only remaining motor vehicles wholly built in Coventry.

The manufacture of [[machine tools]] was once a major industry in Coventry. [[Alfred Herbert (company)|Alfred Herbert Ltd]] became one of the largest machine tool companies in the world. In later years the company faced competition from foreign machine tool builders and ceased trading in 1983. Other Coventry machine tool manufacturers included A.C. Wickman, and Webster & Bennett. The last Coventry machine tool manufacturer was [[Arms-to-Iraq|Matrix Churchill]] which was forced to close in the wake of the [[Project Babylon|Iraqi Supergun (Project Babylon)]] scandal.

Coventry's main industries include: cars, electronic equipment, machine tools, agricultural machinery, man-made fibres, aerospace components and telecommunications equipment. In recent years, the city has moved away from manufacturing industries towards business services, finance, research, design and development and creative industries.

Major improvements continue to regenerate the city centre. The Phoenix Initiative, which was designed by [[MJP Architects]], reached the final shortlist for the 2004 [[Stirling Prize|RIBA Stirling Prize]] and has now won a total of 16 separate awards.

In October 2006, Coventry City Council signed the [[Nottingham Declaration]], joining 130 other UK councils in committing to reduce the [[greenhouse gas emissions]] of the council and to help the local community do the same.

==Transport==
===Roads===
Coventry is near the [[M1 motorway|M1]], [[M6 motorway|M6]], [[M40 motorway|M40]], [[M45 motorway|M45]] and [[M69 motorway]]s. The M45, which is situated a few miles to the south-east of the city, was opened in 1959 as a spur to the original section of the [[M1 motorway]], which linked [[London]] with the Midlands. This was, in effect, the first motorway to serve Coventry, as the section of the M6 north of the city did not open until 1971 and the M69 between Coventry and [[Leicester]] opened five years later. The M40, which is connected to the city via the [[A46 road|A46]], is {{convert|12|mi|abbr=off}} south of the city centre, south of [[Warwick]] and gives the city's residents an alternative dual carriageway and motorway route to London.

It is served by the [[A45 road|A45]] and [[A46 road|A46]] dual carriageways. The A45 originally passed through the centre of the city, but was re-routed in the 1930s on the completion of the Coventry Southern Bypass, with westbound traffic heading in the direction of [[Birmingham]] and eastbound traffic in the direction of [[Northampton]]. The A46 was re-routed to the east of the city in 1989 on completion of the Coventry Eastern Bypass, which directly leads to the M6/M69 interchange. To the south, it gives a direct link to the M40, making use of the existing Warwick and [[Kenilworth]] bypasses.

=== Coventry and Birmingham accents ===
Phonetically the accent of Coventry, like the perhaps better known accent of Birmingham, is similar to Northern English with respect to its system of short vowels. For example, it lacks the BATH/TRAP (Cov. /baθ/, Southern /bɑːθ/) and FOOT/STRUT (Cov. /strʊt/, Southern /strʌt/) splits.<ref name="Trugill"/> Yet the longer vowels in the accent also contain traces of [[Estuary English]] such as a partial implementation of the London [[diphthong]] shift, increasingly so amongst the young since 1950. We also see other [[Estuary English]] features, such as a /l/-vocalisation whereby words such as 'milk' come to be pronounced as /mɪʊk/.<ref name="Trugill"/> However, the distinction between Coventry and Birmingham accents is often overlooked. Certain features of the Birmingham accent (e.g. occasional tapping of prevocalic /r/ in words such as 'crack') stop starkly as one moves beyond Solihull in the general direction of Coventry, a possible approximation of the 'Arden Forest' divide perhaps. In any case, Coventry sits right at a dialectal crossroads, very close to isoglosses that generally delineate 'Northern' and 'Southern' dialects, exhibiting features from both sides of the divide.<ref name="Trugill"/>

The [[Woodlands Academy, Coventry|Woodlands Academy]] and Tile Hill Wood School were the last remaining single sex schools in the city, serving boys and girls respectively. These schools merged onto the Tile Hill Wood site in 2016 before officially being rebranded as [[West Coventry Academy]] in 2017. Both Woodlands and Tile Hill shared a joint sixth form along with The Westwood Academy called West Coventry Sixth Form, but in 2018 Westwood left the sixth form and it now operates under the name West Coventry Academy Sixth Form.

The Westwood Academy, which is a Technology College, is close to the [[University of Warwick]]. It is the only school in Coventry that is a [[Cisco Networking Academy|CISCO Academy]] and has links with other educational establishments, industry and the local community.
