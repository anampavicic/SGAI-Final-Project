'''Plymouth''' <!-- Please do not add a Cornish translation. It is not and never has been an official language used outside Cornwall. Plymouth is not in Cornwall. "Plymouth" is derived from Anglo-Saxon. -->({{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-Plymouth.ogg|ˈ|p|l|ɪ|m|ə|θ}} {{Respell|PLIH|məth}}) is a [[port]] [[city status in the United Kingdom|city]] and [[unitary authority]] in [[Devon]], [[South West England]]. It is located on Devon's south coast between the rivers [[River Plym|Plym]] and [[River Tamar|Tamar]], about {{convert|36|mi|km}} southwest of [[Exeter]] and {{convert|193|mi|km}} southwest of London. It is the most populous city in Devon.

Plymouth's history extends back to the [[Bronze Age]], evolving from a trading post at [[Mount Batten]] into the thriving [[market town]] of Sutton, which was formally re-named as Plymouth in 1439 when it was made a [[borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]]. The settlement has played a significant role in English history, notably in 1588 when an English fleet based here defeated the [[Spanish Armada]], and in 1620 as the departure point for the [[Pilgrim Fathers]] to the [[New World]]. During the [[English Civil War]], the town was held by the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] and was besieged between 1642 and 1646. In 1690 a [[dockyard]] was established on the River Tamar for the [[Royal Navy]] and Plymouth grew as a commercial shipping port throughout the [[Industrial Revolution]].

After absorbing nearby settlements in 1914, the borough was awarded city status in 1928. During [[World War II]], Plymouth suffered extensive damage in the [[Plymouth Blitz]], leading to post-war rebuilding that significantly shaped its modern appearance. A further expansion of its boundaries in 1967 contributed to its current status as the [[List of urban areas in the United Kingdom|30th-most populous built-up area]] in the UK and the second-largest city in the South West after [[Bristol]], with a population in {{United Kingdom statistics year}} of {{English district population|GSS=E06000026}}.

Plymouth's economy, historically rooted in shipbuilding and seafaring, has transitioned towards a service-based economy since the 1990s. It maintains strong maritime connections, hosting [[HMNB Devonport]], the largest operational naval base in Western Europe, and offering ferry links to Brittany and Spain. The city is also home to the [[University of Plymouth]], reflecting its educational and cultural significance. Today, the city is governed locally by [[Plymouth City Council]] and is represented nationally by three<ref>{{Cite web |title=MPs {{!}} PLYMOUTH.GOV.UK |url=https://www.plymouth.gov.uk/mps |access-date=2024-08-22 |website=Plymouth City Council |language=en}}</ref> [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Members of Parliament]].

The settlement of [[Plympton]], further up the [[River Plym]] than the current Plymouth, was also an early trading port. (See [[Plympton]] for the derivation of the name ''Plym''.) As the river silted up in the early 11th century, mariners and merchants were forced to settle downriver, at the current day [[Barbican, Plymouth|Barbican]] near the river mouth.<ref name="early history">{{cite web |title=The early history of Plymouth |url=http://www.plymouth.gov.uk/localhistory |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609032535/http://www.plymouth.gov.uk/localhistory |archive-date=9 June 2008 |access-date=19 July 2008 |publisher=Plymouth City Council}}</ref> At the time this village was called Sutton, meaning ''south town'' in [[Old English]].<ref name="early history" /> The name ''Plym Mouth'', meaning "mouth of the River Plym" was first mentioned in a [[Pipe Rolls|Pipe Roll]] of 1211.<ref>{{cite book

In the late fifteenth century, [[Plymouth Castle]], a "castle quadrate", was constructed close to the area now known as The Barbican; it included four round towers, one at each corner, as featured on the city coat of arms.<ref>{{cite web |title=Plymouth City Council: coat of arms |url=http://www.plymouth.gov.uk/homepage/councilanddemocracy/aboutus/lordmayoralty/coatofarms.htm |access-date=20 February 2015 |archive-date=16 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316011429/http://www.plymouth.gov.uk/homepage/councilanddemocracy/aboutus/lordmayoralty/coatofarms.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>
[[File:Plymouth 1540.png|left|thumb|Charter map of Sutton harbour and Plymouth in 1540]]
The castle served to protect [[Sutton Harbour|Sutton Pool]], which is where the fleet was based in Plymouth prior to the establishment of [[HMNB Devonport|Plymouth Dockyard]]. In 1512, an Act of Parliament was passed to further fortify Plymouth. The work included defensive walls at the entrance to Sutton Pool (across which a chain was extended in times of danger).<ref>{{cite web |title=Magna Britannia: Volume 6, Devonshire – Parishes: Pancras Week – Plymouth : British History Online |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/magna-britannia/vol6/pp381-408#h3-0011 |access-date=20 February 2015 |archive-date=20 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220214203/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/magna-britannia/vol6/pp381-408#h3-0011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Defences on [[St Nicholas Island]] also date from this time, and a string of six artillery [[blockhouse]]s were built, including one on Fishers Nose at the south-eastern corner of the Hoe.<ref>See [http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/unvbrit/a/zoomify82820.html 1591 Spry Map of Plimmouth and surrounding areas, British Library] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519121154/http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/unvbrit/a/zoomify82820.html |date=19 May 2017 }}</ref> This location was further strengthened by the building of a fort (later known as Drake's Fort) in 1596; it was the site of the [[Royal Citadel, Plymouth|Citadel]], established in the 1660s (see below).<ref>{{cite web |title=Drake's Fort and the Royal Citadel |url=http://www.castlesfortsbattles.co.uk/royal_citadel.html |access-date=6 November 2019 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041732/http://www.castlesfortsbattles.co.uk/royal_citadel.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Throughout the 17th century, Plymouth had gradually lost its pre-eminence as a trading port. By the mid-17th century, commodities manufactured elsewhere in England cost too much to transport to Plymouth, and the city had no means of processing sugar or tobacco imports, major products from the colonies. Local sailors turning to piracy such as [[Henry Every]] became infamous, celebrated in the London play [[The Successful Pyrate]]. It played a part in the [[Atlantic slave trade]] during the early 18th century, although it was relatively small.<ref name="slaves" />

In the nearby parish of [[Stoke Damerel]] the first dockyard, [[HMNB Devonport]], opened in 1690 on the eastern bank of the [[River Tamar]].

The ''Plan for Plymouth'' was, on the one hand, a template for the rapid reassembly of a destroyed city centre, but Abercrombie also took the opportunity to lay out a whole hierarchy of settlements across the city of communities, neighbourhoods and districts. Central to this was a revision of transport infrastructure that prioritised the position of the railway as a gateway to the city centre and provided in the long-term for a dual carriageway road by-pass that only finally came into being in the 1980s (forty years after being planned). The plan is the subject of [[Jill Craigie]]'s documentary ''The Way We Live'' (1946).

Plymouth was reformed to become a [[municipal borough]] in 1836, governed by a corporate body officially called the "mayor, aldermen and burgesses of the borough of Plymouth", but generally known as the corporation or town council.<ref>[[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]</ref> When elected county councils were established in 1889, both Plymouth and neighbouring Devonport were considered large enough to provide their own county-level services and so they were made [[county borough]]s, independent from [[Devon County Council]].<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=act|act=Local Government Act 1888|year=1888|chapter=41|access-date=13 August 2023}}</ref> In 1914 the county boroughs of Plymouth and Devonport and the adjoining [[Urban district (England and Wales)|urban district]] of [[East Stonehouse]] were merged to form a single county borough of Plymouth.<ref>{{cite web |title=Local Government Board's Provisional Order Confirmation (No. 18) Act 1914 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Geo5/4-5/183/pdfs/ukla_19140183_en.pdf |website=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives |access-date=30 December 2023}}</ref><ref name="early history" /> Collectively they were referred to as "[[Three Towns|The Three Towns]]".<ref>{{Cite news |date=9 February 1914 |title=Three Towns Amalgamation |work=The Times |location=UK}}</ref>

The 1971 [[Local Government Act 1972|Local Government White Paper]] proposed abolishing county boroughs, which would have left Plymouth, a town of 250,000 people, being administered from a council based at the smaller [[Exeter]], on the other side of the county.

===Constituencies===
In the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], Plymouth is represented by the three [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|constituencies]] of [[Plymouth Moor View (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Moor View]], [[Plymouth Sutton and Devonport (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Sutton and Devonport]] and [[Devon South West (UK Parliament constituency)|South West Devon]].

In 1919, [[Nancy Astor]] was elected the first-ever female member of parliament to take office in the British Houses of Parliament for the constituency of [[Plymouth Sutton]]. She was elected to the seat vacated by her husband [[Waldorf Astor]] on his elevation to the peerage. Lady Astor was a vibrantly active campaigner for her resident constituents.

In 1945, Plymouth-born [[Michael Foot]] was elected Labour MP for the constituency of [[Plymouth Devonport (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Devonport]] which had been heavily damaged in the [[Plymouth Blitz]]. He represented the seat until 1955. After serving as Secretary of State for Education and being responsible for the 1974 [[Health and Safety at Work Act]], he went on to become the leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] (1980–1983).

On 27 April 1944 [[Patrick Abercrombie|Sir Patrick Abercrombie's]] ''Plan for Plymouth'' to rebuild the bomb-damaged city was published; it called for demolition of the few remaining pre-War buildings in the city centre to make way for their replacement with wide, parallel, modern [[boulevard]]s aligned east–west linked by a north–south [[Avenue (landscape)|avenue]] (Armada Way) linking the railway station with the vista of Plymouth Hoe.<ref name="jeremy" />

A peripheral road system connecting the historic Barbican on the east and Union Street to the west determines the principal form of the city centre, even following pedestrianisation of the shopping centre in the late 1980s, and continues to inform the present 'Vision for Plymouth' developed by a team led by Barcelona-based architect [[David Mackay (architect)|David MacKay]] in 2003 which calls for revivification of the city centre with mixed-use and residential.<ref name="vision" />

In suburban areas, post-War [[Prefabricated home|prefabs]] had already begun to appear by 1946, and over 1,000 permanent [[council house]]s were built each year from 1951 to 1957 according to the [[Urban planning#Modern urban planning|Modernist]] [[zoning|zoned]] low-density [[garden city movement|garden city]] model advocated by Abercrombie.<ref name="gillredev" /> By 1964 over 20,000 new homes had been built, more than 13,500 of them permanent council homes and 853 built by the [[British Admiralty|Admiralty]].<ref name="gillredev" />

=== Climate ===
Plymouth has a moderated temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb'') which is wetter and milder than the rest of England. This means a wide range of exotic plants, palm trees, and yuccas can be cultivated. The annual mean high temperature is approximately {{convert|14|°C|°F|0}}.

South West England has a favoured location when the [[Azores High]] pressure area extends north-eastwards towards the UK, particularly in summer. Coastal areas have average annual sunshine totals over 1,600 hours.<ref name="weather" />

Owing to its geographic location, rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic [[Low pressure area|depressions]] or with convection and is more frequent and heavier than in London and southeast England. The Atlantic depressions are more vigorous in autumn and winter and most of the rain which falls in those seasons in the south-west is from this source. Average annual rainfall is around {{convert|980|mm|in|0}}. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest winds.

Smaller stations in the suburban area west of the city centre are served by trains on the [[Tamar Valley Line]] to Gunnislake and local services on the [[Cornish Main Line]], which crosses the Tamar on the [[Royal Albert Bridge]]. This was designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel]] and opened in 1859. The parallel road bridge was completed in 1961.

====History====
The station opened on its present site in 1877 and was previously named ''Plymouth North Road'', when there were other main line stations in the city at [[Plymouth Millbay railway station|Millbay]] and [[Plymouth Friary railway station|Friary]]; these have since closed.

====Future====
There have been proposals to reopen the [[Exeter to Plymouth railway of the LSWR]] which would connect [[Cornwall]] and Plymouth to Exeter using the former [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] main line from Plymouth to Exeter via {{rws|Okehampton}}, because the main line through South Devon is vulnerable to damage from rough seas at {{rws|Dawlish}}, where some of the cliffs are also fragile. There are related proposals to reopen part of the old main line from Bere Alston on the [[Plymouth-Gunnislake line]] as far as Tavistock to serve a new housing development but, although the idea has been discussed since 2008, progress has been slow.

===Roads===
The [[A38 road|A38 dual-carriageway]] runs from east to west across the north of the city; within the city, it is known as 'The [[Parkway]]' and represents the boundary between the older parts of the city and more recently developed suburban areas. Heading east, it connects Plymouth to the [[M5 motorway]], about {{convert|40|mi|km|round=5}} away near [[Exeter]]; heading west, it connects Devon with Cornwall via the [[Tamar Bridge]].

===Buses===
Bus services are provided mainly by [[Plymouth Citybus]] and [[Stagecoach South West]], but a few routes are served by smaller local operators. Long distance inter-city bus services terminate at [[Plymouth coach station]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Plymouth Bus Services |work=Bus Times |date=2023 |access-date=3 October 2023 |url= https://bustimes.org/localities/plymouth |quote=}}</ref>

There are three [[Park and Ride]] services at [[Milehouse]], Coypool ([[Plympton]]) and George Junction ([[Plymouth City Airport]]), which are operated by [[Stagecoach South West]] except Milehouse park and ride. This is served by [[Plymouth Citybus]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Park and ride |url=http://www.plymouth.gov.uk/homepage/transportandstreets/publictransport/parkandride.htm |access-date=16 November 2008 |publisher=Plymouth City Council |archive-date=1 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201191654/http://www.plymouth.gov.uk/homepage/transportandstreets/publictransport/parkandride.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>
