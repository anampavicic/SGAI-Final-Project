It lies on the northern tip of [[Lake Annecy]], {{convert|35|km}} south of [[Geneva]], Switzerland. 

Nicknamed the "Pearl of the French Alps" in [[Raoul Blanchard]]'s monograph describing its location between lake and mountains, the town  controls the northern entrance to the lake gorge. Due to a lack of available building land between the lake and the protected [[Semnoz]] mountain, its population has remained stable, around 50,000 inhabitants, since 1950. However, the 2017 merger with several ex-communes extended the population of the city to 128,199 inhabitants and that of the [[Urban unit|urban area]] to 177,622,<ref>[https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/1405599?geo=UU2020-74601+COM-74010 Unité urbaine 2020 d'Annecy (74601), Commune d'Annecy (74010)], INSEE</ref> placing Annecy seventh in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region.

Switching from the [[County of Geneva|counts of Geneva]]'s dwelling in the 13th century, to the [[County of Savoy|counts of Savoy]]'s in the 14th century, the city became [[Savoy]]'s capital in 1434 during the Genevois-Nemours prerogative until 1659.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}} Its role increased in 1536, during the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Reformation]] in Geneva, while the bishop took refuge in Annecy. Saint [[Francis de Sales]] gave Annecy its advanced Catholic citadel role known as [[Counter-Reformation]]. The [[Treaty of Turin (1860)|annexation of Savoy]] merged the city to France in 1860. 

Sometimes called "Venice of the Alps",{{citation needed|date=October 2022}} this idyllic and touristic representation comes from the three canals and the [[Thiou]] river, which passes through the old city. The city experienced an industrial development in the 19th century with silk manufacturing.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}} Some of its industrial legacy remains today with the headquarters of NTN-SNR bearings, [[Salomon Group|Salomon]], [[Entremont, Haute-Savoie|Entremont]] and [[Dassault Aviation]].

From the end of the 19th century, Annecy developed tourism around its lake summer facilities, winter resorts proximity and cultural attraction with its castle renovation and fine art museum opening in 1956 and the [[Annecy International Animation Film Festival|Animated Film Festival]] since 1963, hosted in Bonlieu's cultural centre. The municipal environmental policy managed to keep 40.3% of green spaces,{{citation needed|date=October 2022}} and the city was awarded the "Golden Flower" in 2015, given to the nine most-flowered French cities.

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Annecy Town Hall.jpg|thumb|left|Annecy City Hall]]
[[File:Annecy.jpg|thumb|left|1914 map, French edition]]

Le vieil Annecy ("Old Annecy"; not to be confused with [[Annecy-le-Vieux]], formerly a neighboring town but now merged into Annecy), was a settlement from the time of the [[Roman Gaul|Romans]].{{sfnp|EB|1878}} Annecy was the court of the [[counts of Geneva]]{{sfnp|EB|1878}} or [[Genevois (province)|Genevois]] from the 10th century.{{sfnp|EB|1911}} It passed to the [[House of Savoy|counts of Savoy]] in 1401.{{sfnp|EB|1911}} In 1444, it became the regional capital of the provinces of [[Genevois (province)|Genevois]], [[Faucigny]] and [[Beaufortain]].

===Counter-Reformation===
With the advance of [[Calvinism]], Annecy became a centre for the [[Counter-Reformation]], the old [[Bishopric of Geneva]] being transferred to it in 1535.{{sfnp|EB|1911}} [[Francis of Sales]] was born in Sales, France in 1567 and served as bishop of [[Bishopric of Annecy|Annecy]] from 1602 to 1622;{{sfnp|EB|1911}} his relics are preserved in the cathedral.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} During the [[French Revolution]], the Savoy region was conquered by France. Annecy became attached to the [[department (France)|department]] of [[Mont-Blanc (département)|Mont Blanc]], whose capital was [[Chambéry]].<ref name=Gallica>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k204214z/f433.image Almanach Impérial an bissextil MDCCCXII], p. 437-438, accessed in [[Gallica]] 23 May 2017 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> The Catholic diocese was suppressed in 1801.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===1815–present===
After the [[Bourbon Restoration in France|Bourbon Restoration]] in 1815, Annecy was returned to the [[King of Sardinia]] and the Catholic diocese restored in 1822.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} When Savoy was annexed to France in 1860 with the [[Treaty of Turin (1860)|Treaty of Turin]], it became the capital of the new department of [[Haute-Savoie]]. Annecy was the site of the second round of [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) talks in 1949. In 2012, a [[Annecy shootings|multiple murder]] occurred in the Annecy area.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19506853 | title=France shootings: Three victims shot in head | publisher=BBC | work=BBC News Online | access-date=6 September 2012 | date=6 September 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Annecy Panorama.jpg|thumb|left|A panoramic image from the southern bank of the [[Thiou]] in the city centre as of July 2018]]

The new municipality was established on 1 January 2017 by merger with the former communes of [[Annecy-le-Vieux]], [[Cran-Gevrier]], [[Meythet]], [[Pringy, Haute-Savoie|Pringy]] and [[Seynod]].<ref>{{cite web

==Geography==
[[File:Annecy_Street_scene_2019.jpg|thumb|left|Annecy city centre, 2019]]

===Climate===
Annecy has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: Cfb) despite its relatively far inland position.

Winters see occasional freezing temperatures, but temperatures most often stay in the single-digits during the daytime with frequent cold rain. [[Air frost]]s are normal during the night and snowfall is not uncommon.
