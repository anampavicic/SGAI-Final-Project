Yogyakarta is the capital of the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]] and served as the Indonesian capital from 1946 to 1948 during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], with [[Gedung Agung]] as the president's office. One of the districts in southeastern Yogyakarta, [[Kotagede]], was the capital of the [[Mataram Sultanate]] between 1587 and 1613.

The city's population was 388,627 at the 2010 Census,<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 373,589 at the 2020 Census;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as of mid-2023 was 375,699, composed of 182,840 males and 192,859 females.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Yogyakarta Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.3471)</ref> Its metropolitan area was home to 4,010,436 inhabitants in 2010, which includes the city of [[Magelang]] and 65 districts across [[Sleman Regency|Sleman]], [[Klaten Regency|Klaten]], [[Bantul Regency|Bantul]], [[Kulon Progo Regency|Kulon Progo]] and [[Magelang Regency|Magelang]] regencies. Yogyakarta has one of the highest [[Human Development Index|HDI]] (Human Development Index) in Indonesia.<ref>[http://bappenas.go.id/download.php?id=8975 Indeks-Pembangunan-Manusia-2014]</ref>

==Etymology and orthography==
Yogyakarta is named after the Indian city of [[Ayodhya (Ramayana)|Ayodhya]], the birthplace of the eponymous hero [[Rama]] from the ''[[Ramayana]]'' epic. ''Yogya'' means "suitable; fit; proper", and ''karta'' means "prosperous; flourishing". Thus, ''Yogyakarta'' means "[a city that is] fit to prosper".<ref>{{cite book |last=Pospelov |first=E. M. |date=2002 |script-title=ru:Географические названия мира. Топонимический словарь. (Geograficheskie nazvaniya mira. Toponimicheskiy slovar)|trans-title=Geographical names of the world. Toponymic dictionary. |language=ru |publisher=Russkie slovari, Astrel, AST |page=138 |isbn=5-17-001389-2 }}</ref>

In colonial era correspondence, the city is often written in the [[Javanese script]] as {{jav|ꦔꦪꦺꦴꦒꦾꦏꦂꦠ}},<ref>{{cite letter |recipient=Sir Thomas Stamford Bingley Raffles |subject=Complimentary addresses from the people of Java to Raffles on his retirement as Lieutenant-Governor in 1816, Raffles Papers f.26v, in the collection of The British Library|date=1816 |url=http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=add_ms_45273_f026v |access-date=2 October 2018 }}</ref> read as {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ŋ|ɑː|j|ɒ|ɡ|j|ə|ˈ|k|ɑr|t|ə|}} with the added prefix ''nga''-. 

In the [[Van Ophuijsen Spelling System|orthography of the time]], the proper name was spelt with the [[Latin alphabet]] as "Jogjakarta". As the orthography of the [[Indonesian language]] changed, the consonant {{IPAc-en|j|}} came to be written with {{angbr|y}}, and the consonant {{IPAc-en|dʒ|}} with {{angbr|j}}. Personal and geographical names however, were allowed to maintain their original spelling according to [[Enhanced Indonesian Spelling System|contemporary Indonesian orthography]]. Thus, the city can be written as "Yogyakarta", which is true to its original pronunciation and the Javanese script spelling, or "Jogjakarta", which is true to the old Dutch spelling and reflects popular pronunciation today, but differs from the original Ayodhya etymology. One may encounter either "Yogyakarta" or "Jogjakarta" in contemporary documents.

==History==
{{moresources|section|date=August 2022}}
===Mataram Kingdom (8th–10th century CE)===
According to the [[Canggal inscription]] dated 732 CE, the area traditionally known as "Mataram" became the capital of the [[Medang Kingdom]], identified as ''Mdang i Bhumi Mataram'' established by [[Sanjaya of Mataram|King Sanjaya of Mataram]]. The inscription was found in a Hindu temple in Central Java, 40&nbsp;km away from Yogyakarta and 20&nbsp;km away from the giant [[Borobudur|Borobudur temple complex]]. This Hindu temple itself was on the border between the area of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Sanjaya dynasty|Sañjaya dynasty]] and the area of the [[Buddhist]] [[Shailendra dynasty]]. 

Mataram became the centre of a refined and sophisticated Javanese Hindu-Buddhist culture for about three centuries in the heartland of the [[Kedu Plain|Progo River valley]], on the southern slopes of [[Mount Merapi]] volcano. This time period witnessed the construction of numerous ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'', including [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]].

Around the year 929 CE, the last ruler of the [[Sanjaya dynasty|Sañjaya dynasty]], [[Mpu Sindok|King Mpu Sindok of Mataram]], moved the seat of power of the Mataram Kingdom from [[Central Java]] to [[East Java]] and thus established the [[Isyana dynasty]]. The exact cause of the move is still uncertain; however, a severe eruption from Mount Merapi or a power struggle with the [[Sumatra]]-based [[Srivijaya|Srivijaya kingdom]] probably caused the move.<ref>{{cite book |last=Spuler |first=Bertold |author2=F.R.C Bagley |date=1981 |title=The Muslim World: A Historical Survey, Part IV |location=Leiden, The Netherlands |publisher=Brill Archive |page=252 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VNgUAAAAIAAJ |isbn= 978-90-04-06196-5 }}</ref> 

Historians suggest that some time during the reign of [[Wawa of Mataram|King Wawa of Mataram]] (924–929 CE), Merapi erupted and devastated the kingdom's capital in Mataram.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Kusumayudha |first1=Sari Bahagiarti |last2=Murwanto |first2=Helmy |last3=Sutarto |last4=Choiriyah |first4=Siti Umiyatun |chapter=Volcanic Disaster and the Decline of Mataram Kingdom in the Central Java, Indonesia |series=Sustainable Civil Infrastructures |date=2019 |editor-last=Wasowski |editor-first=Janusz |editor2-last=Dijkstra |editor2-first=Tom |title=Recent Research on Engineering Geology and Geological Engineering |chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-02032-3_8 |location=Cham |publisher=Springer International Publishing |pages=84 |doi=10.1007/978-3-030-02032-3_8 |isbn=978-3-030-02032-3}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Adelayanti |first=Natasa |date=2020-11-30 |title=Mount Merapi Getting Near to Eruption |url=https://ugm.ac.id/en/news/20436-mount-merapi-getting-near-to-eruption/ |access-date=2024-03-23 |website=ugm.ac.id}}</ref>

===Majapahit Empire (1293–1527)===
During the [[Majapahit]] era, the area surrounding modern Yogyakarta was identified again as "Mataram" and recognised as one of the twelve Majapahit provinces in Java ruled by [[Wikramawardhana|Bhre Mataram]]. During the reign of the fourth king of the Majapahit Empire, the Hindu [[Hayam Wuruk|King Hayam Wuruk]] (1350–1389) of the [[Rajasa dynasty]], the title of Bhre Mataram was held by the king's nephew and son-in-law [[Wikramawardhana]], later the fifth king of Majapahit.<ref>{{cite book |last= Cœdès |first=George |author-link= Georges Coedès |translator-last=Brown Cowing |translator-first=Sue |editor-last=Vella |editor-first=Walter F. |title= The Indianized States of Southeast Asia |location=Honolulu |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |date= 1968 |page=241 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iDyJBFTdiwoC |isbn= 978-0-8248-0368-1 }}</ref>

===Mataram Sultanate (1587–1755)===
[[File:Kota Gede Jogjakarta.jpg|thumb|left|Kotagede, former capital of the Mataram Sultanate.]]
[[Kotagede]], now a district in southeastern Yogyakarta, was established as the capital of the [[Mataram Sultanate]] from 1587 to 1613. 

During the reign of [[Sultan Agung of Mataram|Sultan Agung Hanyokrokusumo]] (1613–1645), the Mataram Sultanate reached its zenith as the greatest kingdom in Java, and expanded its influence to Central Java, East Java, and half of West Java. After two changes of capital—to Karta and then to Plered, both located in present-day [[Bantul Regency]]—the capital of the Mataram Sultanate finally moved to [[Kartasura]].{{cn|date=August 2022}}

===Yogyakarta secedes and European invasions (1745–1830)===
[[File:Jogja.kraton.jpg|thumb|upright|The pavilion of the Museum of Sultan Hamengkubuwana IX, located in the main side of [[Yogyakarta Sultanate|Yogyakarta Royal Palace]]]]
[[File:Eastern face of west gate, Taman Sari, Yogyakarta, 2014-04-24 (from 19 images).jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Taman Sari (Yogyakarta)|Taman Sari]] Water Castle, the former royal garden of the Sultan of Yogyakarta]]
A civil war in the Mataram Sultanate broke out between [[Pakubuwono II]] (1745–1749), the last ruler of [[Kartasura]], and his younger brother and heir apparent to the throne, [[Prince Mangkubumi]] (later known as Hamengkubuwono I, the first [[Hamengkubuwono|Sultan of Yogyakarta]], and the founder of the current ruling royal house). Pakubuwono II had agreed to cooperate with the [[Dutch East India Company]], and ceded some Mataram territory to the Dutch. Prince Mangkubumi, stood against the agreement, citing concerns that the people would become slaves under Dutch rule. During the war, Prince Mangkubumi defeated Pakubuwono II's forces and declared sovereignty in the Sultanate of Yogyakarta, occupying the southern parts of the former Mataram Sultanate.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

With Pakubowono II dead from illness, the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]] was established as a result of the [[Treaty of Giyanti]] (''Perjanjian Gianti''), signed and ratified on 13 February 1755 among Prince Mangkubumi, the Dutch East India Company, and his nephew [[Pakubuwono III]] and his allies. Ascending to the newly created Yogyakarta throne with the name Sultan Hamengkubuwono I, Mangkubumi thus established the royal [[Hamengkubuwono|House of Hamengkubuwono]], still the ruling house of Yogyakarta today. Sultan Hamengkubuwono I and his family officially moved into the [[Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat|Palace of Yogyakarta]], still the seat of the [[Hamengkubuwono X|reigning sultan]], on 7 October 1756. These events consequently marked the end of the Mataram Sultanate, resulting in the births of the rival [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]] and the [[Surakarta Sunanate]].{{cn|date=August 2022}}

During the brief period of [[Invasion of Java (1811)|British rule over Java]] in 1811, rumours of plans by the Yogyakarta court to launch an attack against the British led to uneasiness among the Britons stationed in Java. On 20 June 1812, [[Stamford Raffles|Sir Stamford Raffles]] led a 1,200-strong British force to capture the Yogyakarta kraton. The Yogyakarta forces, surprised by the attack, were easily defeated; the kraton fell in one day, and was subsequently sacked and burnt.<ref name="When Raffles ran Java">Tim Hanningan,
[http://www.historytoday.com/tim-hannigan/when-raffles-ran-java "When Raffles ran Java"],  historytoday.com.</ref> 

The attack on the kraton was the first of its kind in [[History of Indonesia|Indonesian history]], leaving the Yogyakarta court humiliated. The sultanate found itself involved in conflict again during the [[Java War]].<ref name="When Raffles ran Java"/>

===Republic of Indonesia era (1945–present)===
In 1942, the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]] invaded the [[Dutch East Indies]] and ruled Java until they were defeated in 1945. [[Sukarno]] proclaimed the independence of the [[Indonesian National Revolution#Formation of the Republican government|Indonesian Republic]] on 17 August 1945; Sultan [[Hamengkubuwono IX]] promptly sent a letter to Sukarno, expressing his support for the newly born nation of Indonesia and acknowledging the Yogyakarta Sultanate as part of the Indonesian Republic. 

The Sultanate of Surakarta did the same, and both of the Javanese kingdoms were accordingly awarded privileged statuses as "Special Regions" within the Indonesian Republic. However, because of a leftist anti-royalist uprising in Surakarta, the Sunanate of Surakarta lost its special administrative status in 1946 and was absorbed into [[Central Java]] Province.

Yogyakarta's support was essential in the Indonesian struggle for independence during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] (1945–1949). The city of Yogyakarta became the capital of the Indonesian Republic from 1946 to 1948, after the fall of Jakarta to the Dutch. Later [[Operation Kraai|the Dutch also invaded Yogyakarta]], causing the Republic's capital to be transferred once again, to [[Bukittinggi]] in [[West Sumatra]] on 19 December 1948. The [[General Offensive of 1 March 1949]] resulted in an Indonesian political and strategic victory against the Dutch and the withdrawal of Dutch forces from Yogyakarta. On 29 June 1949 Yogyakarta was completely cleared of Dutch forces, under pressure from the [[United Nations]].

For its significant contribution to the survival of the Indonesian Republic, Yogyakarta was given autonomy as a "special district",<ref>{{Cite book |last =Friend| first =Theodore| title =Indonesian Destinies|page=420| publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press| year =2003| isbn =0-674-01834-6}}</ref> making it the only region headed by a recognised monarchy in [[Indonesia]].

==Geography==
{{Unsourced|section|date=August 2022}}
The area of the city of Yogyakarta is {{convert|32.82|km2|1|abbr=off}}. While the city spreads in all directions from the ''[[Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat|Kraton]]'', the Sultan's palace, the core of the modern city is to the north, centred around [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial-era]] buildings and the commercial district. [[Jalan Malioboro]], with rows of pavement vendors and nearby markets and malls, is the primary shopping street for tourists in the city, while Jalan Solo, further north and east, is the shopping district more frequented by locals. The large local market of [[Beringharjo]] ([[:id:Pasar Beringharjo|id]]) and the restored Dutch fort of [[Fort Vredeburg|Vredeburg]] are on the eastern part of the southern end of Malioboro.

Surrounding the ''Kraton'' is a densely populated residential neighbourhood that occupies land that was formerly the Sultan's sole domain. Evidence of this former use remains in the form of old walls, scattered throughout the city, and the ruins of the [[Taman Sari (Yogyakarta)|Taman Sari]] water castle, built in 1758 as a pleasure garden. No longer in use by the Sultan, the garden was largely abandoned before being used for housing by palace employees and descendants. Reconstruction efforts began in 2004, and the site is now a popular tourist attraction.

Nearby to the city of Yogyakarta is [[Mount Merapi]], with the northern outskirts of the city running up to the southern slopes of the mountain in [[Sleman Regency]]. Mount Merapi (literally "mountain of fire" in both Indonesian and Javanese), is an active [[stratovolcano]] located on the border between Central Java and Yogyakarta. It is the most active volcano in Indonesia and has erupted regularly since 1548, with the last eruption occurring in May 2018.

==Climate==
Yogyakarta features a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Am'') as the precipitation in the driest months between June and September are below {{convert|100|mm|abbr=off}}. The wettest month in Yogyakarta is January with precipitation totalling {{convert|392|mm|abbr=off}}. The climate is influenced by the monsoon. The annual temperature is roughly about 26 to 27 Celsius. The hottest month is April with average temperature 27.1 Celsius.
