It is located in southwestern Iceland, on the southern shore of [[Faxaflói]] bay. With a latitude of 64°08′ N, the city is the [[List of northernmost items|world's northernmost capital]] of a sovereign state.{{efn|[[Nuuk]] is farther north, but [[Greenland]] is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.}} Reykjavík has a population of around 140,000 as of 2023 (up from 121,822 in 2015). The [[Capital Region (Iceland)|Capital Region]] has a population of around 248,000.<ref>[https://www.skra.is/um-okkur/frettir/frett/2022/09/02/Ibuafjoldi-eftir-sveitarfelogum-september-2022/ Íbúafjöldi eftir sveitarfélögum september 2022] Skra.is, september 8th 2022</ref>

Reykjavík is believed to be the location of the first permanent settlement in Iceland, which, according to {{lang|is|[[Landnámabók]]}}, was established by [[Ingólfr Arnarson|Ingólfur Arnarson]] in 874 [[Anno Domini|AD]]. Until the 18th century, there was no urban development in the city location. The city was officially founded in 1786 as a trading town and grew steadily over the following decades, as it transformed into a regional and later [[Country|national]] centre of [[commerce]], population, and governmental activities.

Reykjavík is the centre of Iceland's [[Culture of Iceland|cultural]], [[Economy of Iceland|economic]], and [[Government of Iceland|governmental]] activity, and is a popular tourist destination among foreigners. It is among the cleanest, greenest, and safest cities in the world.<ref>{{cite news |last=Yunlong |first=Sun |title=Reykjavík rated cleanest city in Nordic and Baltic countries |date=23 December 2007 |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-12/23/content_7299747.htm |url-status=dead |publisher=Xinhua News Agency |access-date=29 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040328/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-12/23/content_7299747.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=15 Green Cities |url=http://grist.org/article/cities3/ |url-status=live |work=Grist |date=20 July 2007 |access-date=29 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923035957/http://grist.org/article/cities3/ |archive-date=23 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Iceland among Top 10 safest countries and Reykjavík is the winner of Tripadvisor Awards |date=20 May 2010 |url=http://www.travelio.net/iceland-among-top-10-safest-countries-and-reykjavik-is-the-winner-of-tripadvisor-awards.html |work=TRAVELIO.net |access-date=29 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221205959/http://www.travelio.net/iceland-among-top-10-safest-countries-and-reykjavik-is-the-winner-of-tripadvisor-awards.html |archive-date=21 February 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==

[[File:Reykjavik 1860s.jpg|thumb|right|Reykjavík in the 1860s]]
According to legend, the first permanent [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlement in Iceland was established at Reykjavík by [[Ingólfr Arnarson]] circa AD 870, as described in the [[Landnámabók|Book of Settlement]]. Ingólfr is said to have decided the location of his settlement using a traditional Norse method: when land was in sight, he cast his [[öndvegissúlur|high seat pillars]] overboard and promised to settle where the gods decided to bring them ashore. Two of his slaves then searched the coasts for three years before finding the pillars in the bay which eventually became the site of Reykjavík.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jon Gunnar Jørgensen |title=Ingólfr Arnarson Bjǫrnólfsson Ingolv Ørnss |url=https://nbl.snl.no/Ing%C3%B3lfr_Arnarson_Bj%C7%ABrn%C3%B3lfsson_Ingolv_%C3%98rnsson |publisher=Norsk biografisk leksikon |language=no |access-date=20 April 2022}}</ref>

===Etymology===
The name is of [[Old Norse]] origin, derived from the roots {{wikt-lang|non|reykr}} ('smoke') and {{wikt-lang|non|vík}} ('bay'). The name is said to be inspired by steam rising from [[hot spring]]s in the region. The original name was ''Reykja'''r'''-vík'',<ref name="Vísindavefurinn_örnefni">{{cite web|url=http://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=2252|title=Er eitthvert örnefni á höfuðborgarsvæðinu eða vík eða vogur, sem heitir Reykjavík?|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107112309/https://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=2252 |archive-date=7 November 2017|work=Vísindavefurinn|language=is|url-status=live}}</ref> with an "r" [[suffix]] for the [[genitive case|genitive]] [[grammatical number|singular]] of ''reykr''; the modern version ''reykja-'' uses the genitive plural. The name's meaning is still transparent in modern Icelandic, and in modern Norwegian (''røyk'' + ''vik''). The name originally referred to both the bay on the northern shore of the modern city centre, between {{ill|Örfirisey|is}} and [[Laugarnes]], as well as the estate and farm of Ingólfr Arnarson. This form of the name fell out of use shortly after settlement, and the estate was referred to as ''Vík á Seltjarnarnesi'' until the name Reykjavík was revived when urban development began centuries later.<ref name="Vísindavefurinn_örnefni" /> The name has been translated as ''Bay of Smoke'' in English-language travel guides.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Reykjavik |title=Reykjavík |encyclopedia=Britannica}}</ref>

===Urban development===
The site of the modern city centre was farmland until the 18th century. In 1752, [[Frederick V of Denmark|King Frederik V of Denmark]] donated the estate of Reykjavík to the {{ill|Innréttingar|is|Innréttingarnar}} corporation. The leader of this movement was {{Interlanguage link|Skúli Magnússon|is}}. In the 1750s, several houses were built to house the [[wool]] industry, which was Reykjavík's most important employer for a few decades and the original reason for its existence. Other industries were undertaken by the Innréttingar, such as [[fishing|fisheries]], [[sulfur|sulphur mining]], agriculture, and shipbuilding.<ref>[http://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=1752 Hvaðan kemur nafnið "Innréttingarnar" á fyrirtækinu sem starfaði hér á á 18. öld?] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910092150/http://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=1752 |date=10 September 2016}}. Vísindavefur. (in Icelandic)</ref>

The Danish Crown abolished monopoly trading in 1786 and granted six communities around the country an exclusive trading charter. Reykjavík was one of them and the only one to hold on to the charter permanently. 1786 is thus regarded as the date of the city's founding. Trading rights were limited to subjects of the Danish Crown, and Danish traders continued to dominate trade in Iceland. Over the following decades, their business in Iceland expanded. After 1880, [[free trade]] was expanded to all nationalities, and the influence of Icelandic merchants started to grow.

===Rise of nationalism===
[[File:Pg107 Main street of Reykjavik and Governors house.jpg|thumb|Reykjavík in 1881]]
[[File:The meeting – house „Góðtemplarahúsið“ on Templarasund,1923-1935.jpg|thumb|Reykjavík in the 1920s]]
[[Icelandic nationalism|Icelandic nationalist]] sentiment gained influence in the 19th century, and the idea of Icelandic independence became widespread. Reykjavík, as Iceland's only city, was central to such ideas. Advocates of an independent Iceland realized that a strong Reykjavík was fundamental to that objective. All the important events in the history of the independence struggle were important to Reykjavík as well. In 1845 the {{lang|is|[[Althing|Alþingi]]|italic=no}}, the general assembly formed in 930 AD, was re-established in Reykjavík; it had been suspended a few decades earlier when it was located at [[Þingvellir]]. At the time it functioned only as an advisory assembly, advising the king about Icelandic affairs. The location of Alþingi in Reykjavík effectively established the city as the capital of Iceland.

In 1874, Iceland was given a [[constitution]]; with it, Alþingi gained some limited legislative powers and in essence became the institution that it is today. The next step was to move most of the executive power to Iceland: [[Home rule|Home Rule]] was granted in 1904 when the office of [[Prime Minister of Iceland|Minister for Iceland]] was established in Reykjavík. On 1 December 1918, Iceland became a sovereign country, the [[Kingdom of Iceland]], in [[personal union]] with the [[List of Danish monarchs|Crown of Denmark]].

By the 1920s and 1930s, most of the growing Icelandic fishing trawler fleet sailed from Reykjavík; [[cod]] production was its main industry, but the [[Great Depression]] hit Reykjavík hard with [[unemployment]], and labour union struggles sometimes became violent.

===World War II===
On the morning of 10 May 1940, following the German occupation of [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] on 9 April 1940, four British warships approached Reykjavík and anchored in the harbour. In a few hours, the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Invasion of Iceland|occupation of Reykjavík]] was complete. There was no armed resistance, and taxi and truck drivers even assisted the invasion force, which initially had no motor vehicles. The Icelandic government had received many requests from the British government to consent to the occupation, but it always declined on the basis of its [[Neutral country|policy of neutrality]]. For the remaining years of [[World War II]], British and later American soldiers occupied camps in Reykjavík, and the number of foreign soldiers in Reykjavík became about the same as the local population of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.marines.mil/Portals/1/Publications/The%20United%20States%20Marines%20in%20Iceland,%201941-1942%20%20PCN%2019000412300.pdf |title=The United States Marines in Iceland, 1941–1942 |publisher=Historical Division Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps |editor-last=Clifford |editor-first=Kenneth J. |location=Washington, DC |date=1970}}</ref> [[The Royal Regiment of Canada]] formed part of the garrison in Iceland during the early part of the war.

The economic effects of the occupation were positive for Reykjavík: the unemployment of the Depression years vanished, and construction work began. The British built [[Reykjavík Airport]], which remains in service today, mostly for short-haul flights (to domestic destinations and Greenland). The Americans, meanwhile, built [[Keflavík International Airport|Keflavík Airport]], situated {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Reykjavík, which became Iceland's primary international airport.<ref>{{cite web |title=About KEF airport |url=https://www.isavia.is/en/keflavik-airport/about-kef |access-date=30 November 2023 |website=www.isavia.is}}</ref> In 1944, the Republic of Iceland was founded and a [[List of Presidents of Iceland|president]], elected by the people, replaced the king; the office of the president was placed in Reykjavík.

===Post-war development===
In the [[post-war]] years, the growth of Reykjavík accelerated. An exodus from the rural countryside began, largely because improved technology in agriculture reduced the need for manpower, and because of a population boom resulting from better living conditions in the country. A once-primitive village was rapidly transformed into a modern city. Private cars became common, and modern apartment complexes rose in the expanding suburbs.

In 1972, Reykjavík hosted the famous [[World Chess Championship 1972|World Chess Championship]] between [[Bobby Fischer]] and [[Boris Spassky]]. The 1986 [[Reykjavík Summit]] between [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] underlined Reykjavík's international status. [[Deregulation]] in the financial sector and the computer revolution of the 1990s again transformed Reykjavík. The financial and IT sectors are now significant employers in the city.

The city has fostered some world-famous musicians and artists in recent years, including musicians [[Björk]]; [[Múm]] and [[Sigur Rós]]; writer [[Sjón]]; and visual artist [[Ragnar Kjartansson (sculptor)|Ragnar Kjartansson]].

==Geography==
[[File:Reykjavik view.jpg|thumb|Reykjavik view during sunrise]]
[[File:Reykjavikfromabove.jpg|thumb|Reykjavík seen from above]]
[[File:Reykjavik Esja.jpg|thumb|[[Esjan|Esja]], the mountain range to the north of Reykjavík]]
Reykjavík is located in the southwest of [[Iceland]]. The Reykjavík area [[coastline]] is characterized by [[Peninsula|peninsulas]], coves, straits, and islands.

During the [[Quaternary glaciation|Ice Age]] (up to 10,000 years ago) a large glacier covered parts of the city area, reaching as far out as [[Álftanes]]. Other parts of the city area were covered by sea water. In the warm periods and at the end of the Ice Age, some hills like Öskjuhlíð were islands. The former sea level is indicated by sediments (with clams) reaching (at Öskjuhlíð, for example) as far as {{convert|43|m|0|abbr=on}} above the current sea level. The hills of Öskjuhlíð and Skólavörðuholt appear to be the remains of former [[shield volcanoes]] which were active during the warm periods of the Ice Age. After the Ice Age, the land rose as the heavy load of the glaciers fell away, and began to look as it does today.

The capital city area continued to be shaped by [[earthquake]]s and [[Volcano|volcanic eruptions]], such as the one 4,500 years ago in the mountain range [[Bláfjöll]], when the lava coming down the Elliðaá valley reached the sea at the bay of Elliðavogur.

The largest river to run through Reykjavík is the [[Elliðaár|Elliðaá]] River, which is non-navigable. It offers [[salmon]] fishing within the city limits.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.frommers.com/destinations/reykjavik/active-pursuits/fishing |title=Fishing in Reykjavik |work=Frommer's |access-date=23 June 2021}}</ref> Mount [[Esja]], at {{convert|914|m|0|abbr=on}}, is the highest mountain in the vicinity of Reykjavík.

The city of Reykjavík is mostly located on the Seltjarnarnes peninsula, but the suburbs reach far out to the south and east. Reykjavík is a spread-out city: most of its urban area consists of low-density suburbs, and houses are usually widely spaced. The outer residential neighbourhoods are also widely spaced from each other; in between them are the main traffic arteries and a lot of empty space. The city's latitude is 64°08' N, making it the [[List of northernmost items|world's northernmost capital]] of a sovereign state ([[Nuuk]], the capital of [[Greenland]], is slightly further north at 64°10' (about 4&nbsp;km) but Greenland is a [[Denmark#Danish Realm|constituent country]], not an independent state).

===Climate===

Reykjavík has a [[Oceanic climate#Subpolar variety (Cfc, Cwc)|subpolar oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfc'', [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Eolk'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=3040&cityname=Reykjavik,+Capital+Region,+Iceland&units=|title=Reykjavik, Iceland Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=8 November 2018}}</ref> closely bordering on a [[subarctic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfc'') in the 0°C isotherm. The city has had its present climate classification since the beginning of the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?useExisting=1&layers=7a53584fa55643df969f93cec83788e1|title=Köppen Climate Classification of 1900–2100|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108224555/https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?useExisting=1&layers=7a53584fa55643df969f93cec83788e1|archive-date=8 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/shifts.htm|title=Shifts climate|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130211037/http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/shifts.htm|archive-date=30 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

At 64° north, Reykjavík is characterized by extremes of day and night length over the course of the year. From 20 May to 24 July, daylight is essentially permanent as the sun never gets more than 5° below the horizon. Day length drops to less than five hours between 2 December and 10 January. The sun climbs just 3° above the horizon during this time. However, day length begins increasing rapidly during January and by month's end there are seven hours of daylight.

Despite its northern latitude, temperatures very rarely drop below {{convert|-15|C|0}} in the winter. The proximity to the [[Arctic Circle]] and the strong moderation of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the [[Iceland]]ic coast (influence of [[North Atlantic Current]], an extension of the [[Gulf Stream]]) shape a relatively mild winter and cool summer. The city's coastal location does make it prone to wind, however, and [[gale]]s are common in winter (influence of the [[Icelandic Low]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Icelandic low |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Icelandic-low |publisher=[[Britannica]] |access-date=17 February 2021}}</ref>&nbsp;Summers are cool, with temperatures fluctuating between {{convert|10|and|15|C}}, rarely exceeding {{convert|20|C|0}}. This is a result of exposure to the maritime winds in its exposed west coast location that causes it to be much cooler in summer than similar latitudes in mainland [[Scandinavia]]. Contrasting this, winter days are milder than anywhere in far southern [[Sweden]] and the vast majority of [[Denmark]]. In fact, winter temperatures are comparable to those of [[New York City]], which is more than 20 degrees further south.

In the summer of 2007, no rain was measured for one month. July and August are the warmest months of the year on average and January and February the coldest.

Summer tends to be the sunniest season, although May averages the most sunshine of any individual month.

==City administration==
The [[Reykjavík City Council]] governs the city of Reykjavík<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.althingi.is/lagas/128b/1998045.html |title=1998 nr. 45 3. júní/ Sveitarstjórnarlög |publisher=Althingi.is |access-date=8 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021235217/http://www.althingi.is/lagas/128b/1998045.html |archive-date=21 October 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> and is directly elected by those aged over 18 domiciled in the city. The council has 23 members who are elected using the [[open list]] method for four-year terms.

The council selects members of boards, and each board controls a different field under the city council's authority. The most important board is the City Board that wields the executive rights along with the City Mayor. The City Mayor is the senior public official and also the director of city operations. Other public officials control city institutions under the mayor's authority. Thus, the administration consists of two different parts:
* The political power of City Council cascading down to other boards
* Public officials under the authority of the city mayor who administer and manage implementation of policy.

===Political control===
The [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] was historically the city's ruling party; it had an overall majority from its establishment in 1929 until 1978, when it narrowly lost. From 1978 until 1982, there was a three-party coalition composed of the [[People's Alliance (Iceland)|People's Alliance]], the [[Social Democratic Party (Iceland)|Social Democratic Party]], and the [[Progressive Party (Iceland)|Progressive Party]]. In 1982, the Independence Party regained an overall majority, which it held for three consecutive terms. The 1994 election was won by [[Reykjavíkurlistinn]] (the R-list), an alliance of Icelandic socialist parties, led by [[Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir]]. This alliance won a majority in three consecutive elections, but was dissolved for the 2006 election when five different parties were on the ballot. The Independence Party won seven seats, and together with the one Progressive Party it were able to form a new majority in the council which took over in June 2006.

In October 2007 a new majority was formed on the council, consisting of members of the Progressive Party, the [[Social Democratic Alliance]], the [[Left-Green Movement|Left-Greens]] and the F-list (liberals and independents), after controversy regarding REI, a subsidiary of OR, the city's energy company. However, three months later the F-list formed a new majority together with the Independence Party. [[Ólafur Friðrik Magnússon|Ólafur F. Magnússon]], the leader of the F-list, was elected mayor on 24 January 2008, and in March 2009 the Independence Party was due to appoint a new mayor. This changed once again on 14 August 2008 when the fourth coalition of the term was formed, by the Independence Party and the Social Democratic Alliance, with [[Hanna Birna Kristjánsdóttir]] becoming mayor.

The [[2010 Icelandic municipal elections|City Council election in May 2010]] saw a new political party, [[Besti flokkurinn|The Best Party]], win six of 15 seats, and it formed a coalition with the Social Democratic Alliance; comedian [[Jón Gnarr]] became mayor.<ref name=best>{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/10194757.stm | title = Best Party wins polls in Iceland's Reykjavík | access-date = 30 May 2010 | date = 30 May 2010 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> At the 2014 election, the Social Democratic Alliance had its best showing yet, gaining five seats in the council, while [[Bright Future (Iceland)|Bright Future]] (successor to the Best Party) received two seats and the two parties formed a coalition with the [[Left-Green movement]] and the [[Pirate Party (Iceland)|Pirate Party]], which won one seat each. The Independence Party had its worst election ever, with only four seats.

===Mayor===
{{main|Mayor of Reykjavík}}
The mayor is appointed by the city council; usually one of the council members is chosen, but they may also appoint a mayor who is not a member of the council.

The post was created in 1907 and advertised in 1908. Two applications were received, from [[Páll Einarsson]], sheriff and town mayor of [[Hafnarfjörður]] and from [[Knud Zimsen]], town councillor in Reykjavík. Páll was appointed on 7 May and was mayor for six years. At that time the city mayor received a salary of 4,500 ISK per year and 1,500 ISK for office expenses. The current mayor is {{ill|Einar Þorsteinsson|is|Einar Þorsteinsson (f. 1978)}}.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2024/01/16/einar_tekur_vid_af_degi/|title=Einar tekur við af Degi|trans-title=|language=is|publisher=[[Morgunblaðið]]|date=16 January 2024 |access-date=20 January 2024}}</ref>

[[Borgartún]] is the financial centre of Reykjavík, hosting a large number of companies and three investment banks.

There are 14 embassies in Reykjavik, in addition to ambassadorial residences, and representative offices for Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the European Union.<ref name=embassy>{{cite web | url=https://www.government.is/library/01-Ministries/Ministry-for-Foreign-Affairs/PDF-skjol/Diplomatic-List/Diplomatic%20List.pdf | title=Diplomatic List | publisher=Government of Iceland Ministry for Foreign Affairs | date=May 2023 | access-date=September 25, 2023}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==

===Roads===
Per capita [[Automobile|car]] ownership in Iceland is among the highest in the world at roughly 522 vehicles per 1,000 residents,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/tra_mot_veh-transportation-motor-vehicles| publisher=nationmaster.com| work=United Nations World Statistics Pocketbook| title=Motor vehicles (most recent) by country| access-date=29 March 2010| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327112758/http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/tra_mot_veh-transportation-motor-vehicles| archive-date=27 March 2010| url-status=live}}</ref> though Reykjavík is not severely affected by [[Traffic congestion|congestion]]. Several multi-lane highways (mainly [[dual carriageway]]s) run between the most heavily populated areas and most frequently driven routes. Parking spaces are also plentiful in most areas. Public transportation consists of a bus system called [[Strætó bs]]. [[Route 1 (Iceland)|Route 1]] (the Ring Road) runs through the city outskirts and connects the city to the rest of Iceland.

[[File:Reykjavík Old Harbor.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Old harbour]]

===Airports and seaports===
[[Reykjavík Airport]] is positioned inside the city, just south of the city centre. It is used for domestic flights, general aviation and medical flights. [[Keflavík International Airport]], located around 40km southwest of the city, serves international flights and is the main gateway to the country. Since 1962, there has been some controversy regarding the location of the airport, since it takes up a lot of valuable space in central Reykjavík.

Reykjavík has two [[seaport]]s: the old harbour near the city centre, which is mainly used by [[Fisheries|fishermen]] and [[cruise ship]]s, and ''Sundahöfn'' in the east city, which is the largest [[cargo]] port in the country and serves larger [[cruise ship]]s.

[[File:RHR-Minor.JPG|thumb|right|Two steam locomotives were used to build the harbour [[Rail transport in Iceland|Reykjavík Docks railway]]; both are now on display in Reykjavík.|185x185px]]

===Railways===
There are no public railways in Iceland, because of its sparse population, but the locomotives used to build the docks are on display. Proposals have been made for a high-speed rail link between the city and [[Keflavík]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.icelandreview.com/ask-ir/is-there-any-news-on-borgarlina-or-the-airport-train/ |title=Is there any news on Borgarlína or the airport train? |website=Iceland Review |date=29 June 2022 |access-date=29 May 2023}}</ref>

===District heating===
{{see also|Geothermal power in Iceland}}
[[File:"Under-floor heating" in the street.jpg|thumb|Geothermally powered snow-melting system being installed on Skólavörðustígur, Reykjavík.]]
Volcanic activity provides all of Reykjavík and surrounding areas with [[Geothermal energy|geothermal]] [[district heating]] systems for both residential and industrial districts. In heavily trafficked areas, mostly in the city centre, pavements and streets use geothermal [[snow-melting system]]s. Many driveways of private residences are also fitted with geothermal snow-melting systems. Geothermal hot water is also used to heat the city's numerous public pools and hot tubs. Natural hot water is used to heat roughly 90% of all buildings in Iceland.<ref>{{cite web |title=Geothermal Energy – Orkustofnun |url=https://orkustofnun.is/natural_resources/geothermal_energy |access-date=19 January 2024 |website=Geothermal Energy – Orkustofnun}}</ref> Of total annual use of geothermal energy of 39 [[Joule|PJ]], space heating accounted for 48%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nea.is/geothermal/direct-utilization/ |title=NEA.is |publisher=NEA.is |access-date=25 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724215329/http://www.nea.is/geothermal/direct-utilization |archive-date=24 July 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The total thermal capacity of Reykjavíks hot water production is around 830MW, and the city has an average heating demand of 473 MW.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gretar Ívarsson |date=April 2019 |title=Hitaveita í Reykjavík – Vatnsvinnsla 2018 |url=https://eu-assets.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt5bf0023ca96cf071/bltbf89141dc99c4d9e/63a45186de61af37ca1576a9/hitaveita_i_reykjavik_-_vatnsvinnsla_2018.pdf}}</ref> Hot water for Reyjavík's [[district heating]] comes from two [[combined heat and power]] (CHP) [[geothermal power]] plants as well as lower temperature geothermal fields:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mannvit.com/GeothermalEnergy/DistrictHeating/DistrictHeatinginIceland/ |title=Mannvit |publisher=Mannvit |access-date=25 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007194242/http://www.mannvit.com/GeothermalEnergy/DistrictHeating/DistrictHeatinginIceland/ |archive-date=7 October 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Cultural heritage==
[[File:Landsbokasafn.JPG|thumb|[[Safnahúsið]]]]
[[Safnahúsið]] (the Culture House) was opened in 1909 and has a number of important exhibits. Originally built to house the National Library and National Archives and also previously the location of the National Museum and Natural History Museum, in 2000 it was re-modeled to promote the Icelandic national heritage. Many of Iceland's national treasures are on display, such as the [[Poetic Edda]], and the [[Saga]]s in their original manuscripts. There are also changing exhibitions of various topics.<ref>Guide leaflet to the Culture House 2008, published by the National Centre for Cultural Heritage.</ref>

==Literary heritage==
Reykjavík is the capital, and in fact Iceland's only city, and as such, it plays a vital role in all cultural life in the country. The city is home to Iceland's main cultural institutions, boasts a flourishing arts scene and is renowned as a creative city with a diverse range of cultural happenings and dynamic grassroots activities. Most of the country's writers live in the city, and it also provides the setting for the majority of contemporary Icelandic literature – a development that has gone hand in hand with the rapid expansion of the city in the past 100 years or so.

Reykjavík is home to Icelandic medieval literature, including the [[Sagas of Icelanders|Sagas of the Icelanders]] and the [[Poetic Edda]], landmarks of world literature still widely read and translated today. This literary heritage is the core of the nation's identity and narrative art is the single most important part of its cultural history. The [[Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies]] in Reykjavík is the centre of this heritage. It preserves manuscripts, conducts research on them and publishes texts for the public, in addition to offering research facilities and tutoring to foreign scholars and students. The [[Arnamagnæan Manuscript Collection]] was added to the [[UNESCO]] Memory of the World Register on 31 July 2009. Reykjavík city was designated as a [[UNESCO City of Literature]] in 2011 and joined then the [https://en.unesco.org/creative-cities/home UNESCO Creatives Cities network.]

Iceland is one of the smallest linguistic areas in the world, with only around 330,000 inhabitants and very few speakers outside the country. The language has not changed much since the time of settlement in the 9th century and modern Icelanders can still read the original medieval texts with relative ease. Literature plays a vital role in cherishing and cultivating the language, both original Icelandic literature and translations. Language undergoes constant renewal and development in fiction, and translation of foreign work has also been instrumental in conserving this thousand-year-old literary language.

'''Award-winning authors'''
Several Reykjavík writers have received international and Nordic awards. [[Halldór Laxness]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1955 for "vivid epic power which has renewed the great narrative art of Iceland". The House of Halldór Laxness, [[Gljúfrasteinn]], in the capital area can be visited year-round. A number of writers have won the [[Nordic Council Literature Prize|Nordic Council's Literature Prize]], among them are [[Thor Vilhjálmsson]], [[Einar Már Guðmundsson]] and [[Sjón]], and authors such as [[Guðrún Helgadóttir]], [[Kristín Steinsdóttir]] and [[Ragnheiður Gestsdóttir]] are winners of The [[Nordic Children's Book Prize|Nordic Children's Literature Prize]]. Crime writer [[Arnaldur Indriðason]] has won prizes abroad, including The Golden Dagger Award. Among other prizes awarded to writers from Reykjavík are the Kairos Preis ([[Andri Snær Magnason|Andri Snaer Magnason]]), the Swedish Academy's Nordic Literature Prize ([[Guðbergur Bergsson]]) and the Prix de Page ([[Auður Ava Ólafsdóttir]]). Contemporary Icelandic writers are published in an increased number in translations throughout the world.

===New Year's Eve===
The arrival of the new year is a particular cause for celebration to the people of Reykjavík. Icelandic law states that anyone may purchase and use fireworks between 28th December and 6th January. As a result, every New Year's Eve the city is lit up with [[fireworks]] displays.<ref>{{cite web |date=2021-01-01 |title=Icelanders take New Year's fireworks to dizzying heights |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/icelanders-take-new-years-fireworks-to-dizzying-heights |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240607205935/https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/icelanders-take-new-years-fireworks-to-dizzying-heights |archive-date=2024-06-07 |access-date=2024-06-07 |website=Straits Times}}</ref>
