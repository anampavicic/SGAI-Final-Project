==History==
The area of present-day Sakata was the location of the [[kokufu|provincial capital]] of ancient [[Dewa Province]], although the precise location has yet to be discovered by archaeologists. A port at the mouth of the Mogami River is known to have existed since the [[Kamakura period]]. Although silting rendered it less important in the [[Muromachi period]], the area developed as a major center for the {{Transl|ja|[[kitamaebune]]}} coastal trade during the [[Edo period]]. By the early [[Meiji (era)|Meiji period]], the Honma clan, a local merchant clan, dominated trade and emerged as the largest landholder in Japan.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Traces of their powerful influence on Sakata City can still be seen across the city. This includes the Honma Museum and The Honma Gardens located in the downtown area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehiddenjapan.com/sakata|title = Sakata City Yamagata Japan| date=2 June 2022 }}</ref>
 
With the establishment of the modern municipalities system after the start of the Meiji period, the area was organized as Sakata Town under [[Akumi District, Yamagata|Akumi District]], Yamagata Prefecture in 1878. Approximately 80% of the town was destroyed by the [[1894 Shōnai earthquake]] and subsequent fires. The modern city of Sakata was founded on April 1, 1933.

===World War II===
The city largely escaped damage during [[World War II]], save for a lone [[Air raids on Japan|air raid]] on its port district on August 10, 1945, which left 30 people dead or missing.

On September 20, 1944, over 200 British prisoners of war transfer to the newly created POW camp, known officially as Sakata Branch Camp (Sendai 9-B). The British would later be joined by American, Dutch and Australian POW's. The camp was liberated in September 1945.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mansell.com/pow_resources/camplists/sendai/sendai_09_sakata/sen_09_sakata_main.html|title=Sendai POW Camp #9-B Sakata}}</ref> The camp was originally established as Tokyo 22B, jurisdictional transferred to [[Sendai]] on April 14, 1945. The camp roster included:

* 15 Americans, no deaths
* 248 British, 13 deceased
* 5 Dutch, no deaths
* 26 Australians, 5 deceased

Most of the POW's were transferred from camps in the [[Osaka]] and [[Tokyo]] area and many had survived the sinking of the steamships {{Transl|ja|Kachidoki Maru}} and {{Transl|ja|Rakuyo Maru}}. The men were used as forced labor at the Port of Sakata and some worked for Nittsu, also known as [[Nippon Express]], still operating in Japan today.

===After World War II===
On October 29, 1976, Sakata suffered from a major fire which gutted 22.5 hectares of its city center, destroying 1,774 buildings and injuring 964 people (and one fatality).

On November 1, 2005, the towns of [[Hirata, Yamagata|Hirata]], [[Matsuyama, Yamagata|Matsuyama]], and [[Yawata, Yamagata|Yawata]] (all from [[Akumi District, Yamagata|Akumi District]]) were merged into Sakata.

==Government==
[[File:酒田市役所庁舎.jpg|thumb|Sakata City Hall]]
Higashine has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 28 members. The city contributes five members to the Yamagata Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Yamagata District 3 of the lower house of the [[National Diet|Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
The economy of Sakata is based on light manufacturing, [[agriculture]], and [[commercial fishing]]. The [[Sakata Kyodo Thermal Power Station]] is a fossil-fueled power station operated by a joint venture of [[Tohoku Electric Power|Tohoku Electric]] and Sumitomo Aluminum in the city.

==Culture==

=== Festivals ===
The [[:ja:酒田まつり|Sakata Festival]] is a major historical festival held every year between May 19 and May 21. The first festival was held in 1609, during the Edo period, and was called the {{Nihongo3|{{lit |Sannō Festival}}|山王祭|Sannō Matsuri}}. However, after a large fire damaged much of Sakata in 1976, the festival became a memorial event and was renamed {{Nihongo3|{{lit |Sakata Festival}}|酒田祭|Sakata Matsuri}}. There is a large parade in the central streets of the city, which features festival floats and dancers from schools, local companies, and community organizations. Huge {{Nihongo3|{{lit |lion heads}}|獅子頭|shishi gashira}} are symbols of the festival. It is said that children chewed by the {{Transl|ja|shishi gashira}} will become smart and healthy. About 350 stalls line the side of the main street selling snacks, drinks, and crafts.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sakata-kankou.com/event/80 |title=酒田まつり｜イベント｜酒田さんぽ |access-date=2015-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428083100/http://www.sakata-kankou.com/event/80 |archive-date=2018-04-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
