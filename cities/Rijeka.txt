It is located in [[Primorje-Gorski Kotar County]] on [[Kvarner Bay]], an inlet of the [[Adriatic Sea]] and in 2021 had a population of 108,622 inhabitants.<ref name="dzs-ri-2011">{{Croatian Census 2011|S|08|3735}}</ref> Historically, because of its strategic position and [[Port of Rijeka|its excellent deep-water port]], the city was fiercely contested, especially between the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Italy and Croatia, changing rulers and demographics many times over centuries. According to the [[Demographics of Croatia|2011 census data]], the majority of its citizens are [[Croats]], along with small numbers of [[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs]], [[Bosniaks of Croatia|Bosniaks]] and [[Italians of Croatia|Italians]].

Rijeka is the main city and [[county seat]] of the Primorje-Gorski Kotar County. The city's economy largely depends on shipbuilding ([[shipyard]]s "[[3. Maj]]" and "[[Viktor Lenac Shipyard]]") and maritime transport. Rijeka hosts the [[Croatian National Theatre Ivan pl. Zajc in Rijeka|Croatian National Theatre Ivan pl. Zajc]], first built in 1765, as well as the [[University of Rijeka]], founded in 1973 but with roots dating back to 1632 and the local [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] School of Theology.<ref>{{cite web|title=From The Beginning...|url=http://www.uniri.hr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1123&Itemid=218&lang=en|work=University of Rijeka|access-date=11 September 2015|archive-date=19 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119141303/http://www.uniri.hr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1123&Itemid=218&lang=en|url-status=live}}</ref>

Apart from [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and Italian, linguistically the city is home to its own unique dialect of the [[Venetian language]], [[Fiuman dialect|Fiuman]], with an estimated 20,000 speakers among the local Italians, Croats and other minorities. Historically Fiuman served as the main ''[[lingua franca]]'' among the many ethnicities inhabiting the multi-ethnic port city. In certain suburbs of the modern extended municipality the autochthonous population still speaks [[Chakavian]], a dialect of Croatian.

In 2016, Rijeka was selected as the [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2020, alongside [[Galway]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Croatian city Rijeka wins European Capital of Culture in 2020|url=http://www.shanghaidaily.com/article/article_xinhua.aspx?id=324961|work=[[Shanghai Daily]]|access-date=25 March 2016|archive-date=8 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408041018/http://www.shanghaidaily.com/article/article_xinhua.aspx?id=324961|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Name==
Historically, Rijeka was called '''Tharsatica''', '''Vitopolis''' ({{lit|City of [Saint] [[Saint Vitus|Vitus]]}}), or '''Flumen''' ({{lit|River}}) in [[Latin]]. The city is called {{lang|hr|Rijeka}} in [[Croatian language|Croatian]], {{lang|sl|Reka}} in [[Slovene language|Slovene]], and {{lang|ckm|Reka}} or {{lang|ckm|Rika}} in the local dialects of the [[Chakavian]] language. It is called {{lang|it|Fiume}} in [[Italian language|Italian]] and in [[Fiuman dialect|Fiuman Venetian]]. All these names mean 'river' in their respective languages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dubrovnik-online.net/english/dictionary.php |title=Dubrovnik and Croatia Dictionary and pronunciation of Croatian language |publisher=Dubrovnik-online.net |access-date=7 April 2012 |archive-date=8 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408042530/http://www.dubrovnik-online.net/english/dictionary.php |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="word reference fiume">{{cite web|title=English Translations of Italian word "fiume"|url=http://www.wordreference.com/iten/fiume|publisher=Word Reference online dictionaries|access-date=5 January 2013|archive-date=5 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905200734/http://www.wordreference.com/iten/fiume|url-status=live}}</ref> Meanwhile, in [[German language|German]] the city has been called {{lang|de|Sankt Veit am Flaum}}/{{lang|de|Pflaum}} ({{lit|St. Vitus on the Flaum/Pflaum}}, with the name of [[Rječina|the river]] being derived from Latin {{lang|la|flumen}}).

==Geography==
[[File:Rijekaopatijax.jpg|thumb|left|Rijeka Bay]]
Rijeka is located in western [[Croatia]], {{convert|131|km|abbr=off}} south-west of the capital, [[Zagreb]], on the coast of [[Kvarner Gulf]], in the northern part of the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Geographically, Rijeka is roughly equidistant from [[Milan]] ({{cvt|485|km|disp=sqbr}}), [[Budapest]] ({{cvt|502|km|disp=sqbr}}), [[Munich]] ({{cvt|516|km|disp=sqbr}}), [[Vienna]] ({{cvt|516|km|disp=sqbr}}) and [[Belgrade]] ({{cvt|550|km|disp=sqbr}}). Other major regional centers such as [[Trieste]] ({{cvt|76|km|disp=sqbr}}), [[Venice]] ({{cvt|240|km|disp=sqbr}}) and [[Ljubljana]] ({{cvt|115|km|disp=sqbr}}) are all relatively close and easily accessible. The Bay of Rijeka, which is bordered by Vela Vrata (between [[Istria]] and the island of [[Cres]]), Srednja Vrata (between Cres and [[Krk]] Island) and Mala Vrata (between Krk and the mainland) is connected to the Kvarner Gulf and is deep enough (about {{convert|50|m|disp=or|spell=in}}) to accommodate large commercial ships. The City of Rijeka lies at the mouth of the river [[Rječina]] and in the [[Vinodol, Croatia|Vinodol]] micro-region of the Croatian coast. From three sides Rijeka is surrounded by mountains. To the west, the {{convert|1396|adj=on|m}} [[Učka]] range is prominent. To the north/north-east there are the [[Snežnik (plateau)|Snežnik]] plateau and the {{cvt|1528|m|adj=on}} [[Risnjak]] massif with the [[Risnjak National Park|national park]]. To the east/south-east there is the {{Convert|1533|m|adj=on}} [[Velika Kapela]] range. This type of terrain configuration prevented Rijeka from developing further inland (to the north) and the city mostly lies on a long and relatively narrow strip along the coast. Two important inland transport routes start in Rijeka. The first route runs north-east to the [[Pannonian Basin]]. This route takes advantage of Rijeka's location close to the point where the [[Dinaric Alps]] are the narrowest (about {{convert|50|km|disp=or|spell=in}}) and easiest to traverse, making it the optimal route from the [[Great Hungarian Plain|Hungarian plain]] to the sea. It also makes Rijeka the natural harbour for the Pannonian Basin (especially [[Hungary]]). The other route runs north-west across the [[Postojna Gate]] connecting Rijeka with [[Slovenia]] and further through the [[Ljubljana Gap]] with [[Austria]] and beyond. A third more coastal route runs east-west connecting Rijeka (and—by extension—the [[Adriatic]] coastal cities to the south) with Trieste and northern [[Italy]].

===Ancient and Medieval times===

[[File:Rijeka, Croatia - panoramio (9).jpg|200px|thumb|upright|left|[[Trsat Castle]] lies at the exact spot of an ancient Illyrian and Roman fortress.]] 
Though traces of [[Neolithic]] settlements can be found in the region, the earliest modern settlements on the site were [[Celt]]ic '''Tharsatica''' (modern [[Trsat]], now part of Rijeka) on the hill, and the tribe of mariners, the [[Liburni]], in the natural harbour below. The city long retained its dual character. Rijeka was first mentioned in the 1st century AD by [[Pliny the Elder]] as Tarsatica in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (iii.140).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/3*.html|title=Pliny the Elder: the Natural History, Liber III|publisher=University of Chicago|access-date=12 July 2019|archive-date=23 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230923024415/https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/3%2A.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Rijeka (Tarsatica) is again mentioned around AD 150 by the Greek geographer and astronomer [[Ptolemy]] in his [[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]] when describing the "Location of Illyria or Liburnia, and of Dalmatia" (Fifth Map of Europe).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/2/15*.html |title=The Geography of Claudius Ptolemy, Book II, Chapter 15 |publisher=University of Chicago |access-date=15 February 2020 |archive-date=23 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230923024416/https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/2/15%2A.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In the time of [[Augustus]], the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] rebuilt Tarsatica as a ''[[municipium]]'' '''Flumen''' (MacMullen 2000), situated on the right bank of the small river Rječina (whose name means "the big river"). It became a city within the Roman Province of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] until the 6th century. In this period the city is part of the [[Liburnia]] limes (system of walls and fortifications against raiding Barbarians). Remains of these walls are still visible in some places today.

After the 4th century Rijeka was rededicated to [[St. Vitus]], the city's [[patron saint]], as ''Terra Fluminis sancti Sancti Viti'' or in German ''Sankt Veit am Pflaum''. From the 5th century onwards, the town was ruled successively by the [[Ostrogoths]], the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], the [[Lombards]], and the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]]. The city was burned down in 452 by the troops of [[Attila]] the Hun as part of their [[Sack of Aquileia|Aquileia]] campaign.<ref name="Matica Hrvatska">{{cite web |url=https://www.matica.hr/vijenac/175/Rije%C4%8Dki%20ljetopis/ |title=Riječki Ljetopis (Rijeka Chronicle) - in Croatian |publisher=Matica Hrvatska |access-date=15 February 2020 |archive-date=17 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200117005132/http://www.matica.hr/vijenac/175/Rije%C4%8Dki%20ljetopis/ |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Croats]] settled the city starting in the 7th century giving it the Croatian name, ''Rika svetoga Vida'' ("the river of Saint Vitus"). At the time, Rijeka was a feudal stronghold surrounded by a wall. At the center of the city, its highest point, was a fortress.

In 799 Rijeka was attacked by the [[Franks|Frankish]] troops of [[Charlemagne]]. Their [[Siege of Trsat]] was at first repulsed, during which the Frankish commander Duke [[Eric of Friuli]] was killed. However, the Frankish forces finally occupied and devastated the castle, while the [[Duchy of Croatia]] passed under the overlordship of the [[Carolingian Empire]]. From about 925, the town was part of the [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Kingdom of Croatia]], from 1102 [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|in personal union with Hungary]]. Trsat Castle and the town was rebuilt under the rule of the [[House of Frankopan]]. In 1288 the Rijeka citizens signed the [[Law codex of Vinodol]], one of the oldest codes of law in Europe.

In the period from about 1300 to 1466 Rijeka was ruled by a number of noble families, the most prominent of which was the German [[Walsee family]]. Rijeka even rivalled [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] when in it was sold by Rambert II Walsee to the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]], [[Archduchy of Austria|Archduke of Austria]] in 1466. It would remain under Austrian Habsburg rule for over 450 years (except for a brief period of French rule between 1809 and 1813) until the end of [[World War I]] in 1918 when it was occupied by Croatian and subsequently by Italian irregulars.<ref name="Matica Hrvatska"/>

===Under Habsburg rule===
[[File:Valvasor - Reka.jpg|thumb|left|Rijeka and Trsat]]
[[File:RijekaRiver0.jpg|thumb|right|River [[Rječina]] in city center]]
Austrian presence on the Adriatic Sea was seen as a threat by the [[Republic of Venice]] and during the [[War of the League of Cambrai]] the Venetians raided and devastated the city with great loss of life in 1508 and again in 1509. The city did however recover and remain under Austrian rule. For its fierce resistance to the Venetians it received the title of the "most loyal city" ("fidelissimum oppidium") as well as commercial privileges from the Austrian emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in 1515.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://issuu.com/vedranaspadonitefanic/docs/klen |title=Danilo Klen: Stoljeće I Pol Prilika I Neprilika U Rijeci.

From the 16th century onwards, Rijeka's present [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style started to take shape. Emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] declared the [[Port of Rijeka]] a [[free port]] (together with the [[Port of Trieste]]) in 1719 and had the trade route to Vienna expanded in 1725.

On November 28, 1750 Rijeka was hit by a large earthquake. The devastation was so widespread that the city had to be almost completely rebuilt. In 1753, the Austrian Empress [[Maria Theresa]] approved the funding for rebuilding Rijeka as a "new city" ("Civitas nova"). The rebuilt Rijeka was significantly different - it was transformed from a small medieval walled town into a larger commercial and maritime city centered around its port.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fluminensia.org/potres-1750-promijenio-lice-rijeke |title=Goran Moravček: Potres 1750. promijenio lice Rijeke - Croatian |date=28 November 2012 |publisher=fluminensia.org |access-date=12 February 2021 |archive-date=22 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210122211356/http://fluminensia.org/potres-1750-promijenio-lice-rijeke |url-status=live }}</ref>

By order of Maria Theresa in 1779, the city was annexed to the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] and governed as [[corpus separatum (Fiume)|''corpus separatum'']] directly from Budapest by an appointed governor, as Hungary's only international port. From 1804, Rijeka was part of the [[Austrian Empire]] ([[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] after the [[Compromise of 1867]]), in the Croatia-Slavonia province.<ref>Handbook of Austria and Lombardy-Venetia Cancellations on the Postage Stamp Issues 1850–1864, by Edwin Mueller, 1961.</ref>

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Rijeka was briefly captured by the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and included in the [[Illyrian Provinces]]. During the French rule, between 1809 and 1813, the critically important [[Louisiana road (Croatia)|Louisiana road]] was completed (named after [[Napoleon|Napoleon's]] wife [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie Louise]]). The road was the shortest route from Rijeka to the interior ([[Karlovac]]) and gave a strong impulse to the development of Rijeka's port. In 1813 the French rule came to an end when Rijeka was first bombarded by the [[Royal Navy]] and later re-captured by the Austrians under the command of the Irish general [[Laval Nugent von Westmeath]].<ref>Antoljak, Stjepan. "Prekosavska Hrvatska i pitanje njene reinkorporacije (1813 - 1822)", in Stjepan Antoljak, Stjepan. 1994. ''Hrvati u povijesti'', Split, Književni krug, 1992. (in Croatian)</ref> The British bombardment has an interesting side story. The city was apparently saved from annihilation by a young lady named Karolina Belinić who - amid the chaos and destruction of the bombardment - went to the English fleet commander and convinced him that further bombardment of the city was unnecessary (the small French garrison was quickly defeated and left the city). The legend of Karolina is warmly remembered by the population even today. She became a folk hero Karolina Riječka (Caroline of Rijeka) and has been celebrated in plays, movies and even in a rock opera.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://croatia.hr/en-GB/experiences/culture-and-heritage/legends/caroline-the-woman-who-saved-rijeka |title=Caroline, the Woman Who Saved Rijeka |publisher=croatia.hr |access-date=12 February 2021 |archive-date=29 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201029105051/https://croatia.hr/en-GB/experiences/culture-and-heritage/legends/caroline-the-woman-who-saved-rijeka |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the early 19th century, the most prominent economical and cultural leader of the city was [[Andrija Ljudevit Adamić]]. Fiume also had a significant naval base, and in the mid-19th century it became the site of the Austro-Hungarian Naval Academy (K.u.K. Marine-Akademie), where the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] trained its officers.

===Hungarian Crown===
During the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian revolution of 1848]], when Hungary tried to gain independence from Austria, Rijeka was captured by the Croatian troops (loyal to Austria) commanded by [[Ban of Croatia|Ban]] [[Josip Jelačić]]. The city was then annexed directly to Croatia, although it did keep a degree of autonomy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://povijest.hr/nadanasnjidan/ban-josip-jelacic-postao-guvernerom-rijeke-1848/|title=Ban Josip Jelačić postao guvernerom Rijeke (1848.)|date=December 2021|access-date=12 February 2021|archive-date=24 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210124182054/https://povijest.hr/nadanasnjidan/ban-josip-jelacic-postao-guvernerom-rijeke-1848/|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Giovanni de Ciotta]] (mayor from 1872 to 1896) proved to be an authoritative local political leader. Under his leadership, an impressive phase of expansion of the city started, marked by major port development, fuelled by the general expansion of international trade and the city's connection (1873) to the Austro-Hungarian railway network. Modern industrial and commercial enterprises such as the Royal Hungarian Sea Navigation Company "[[Adria, Rijeka|Adria]]", a rival shipping company the Ungaro-Croata (established in 1891) and the Smith and Meynier paper mill (which operated the first steam engine in south-east Europe), situated in the Rječina canyon, producing cigarette paper sold around the world.

The second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century (up to World War I) was a period of great prosperity, rapid economic growth and technological dynamism for Rijeka. Many authors and witnesses describe Rijeka of this time as a rich, tolerant, well-to-do town which offered a good standard of living, with endless possibilities for making one's fortune. The Pontifical Delegate Celso Costantini noted in his diary "the religious indifference and apathy of the town". The further industrial development of the city included the first industrial scale oil refinery in Europe in 1882<ref>{{cite web |url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/122737 |title=Rafinerija nafte Rijeka – europski pionir u preradi crnog zlata |page=116 |website=[[Hrčak]] |access-date=12 February 2021 |archive-date=31 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210731123540/https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/122737 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the first [[torpedo]] factory in the world in 1866, after [[Robert Whitehead]], manager of the "[[Stabilimento Tecnico Fiumano]]" (an Austrian engineering company engaged in providing engines for the Austro-Hungarian Navy), designed and successfully tested the world's first torpedo. In addition to the Whitehead torpedo factory, which opened in 1874, the oil refinery (1882) and the paper mill, many other industrial and commercial enterprises were established or expanded in these years. These include a rice husking and starch factory (one of the largest in the world), a wood and furniture company, a wheat elevator and mill, the Ganz-Danubius shipbuilding industries, a cocoa and chocolate factory, a brick factory, a tobacco factory (the largest in the Monarchy), a cognac distillery, a pasta factory, the Ossoinack barrel and chest factory, a large tannery, five foundries and many others.<ref name=fried2020>{{cite journal |last=Fried |first=Fiona |year=2020 |title='Out to Sea, Hungarians!'

Rijeka's Austro-Hungarian Marine Academy became a pioneering centre for [[high-speed photography]]. The Austrian physicist Peter Salcher working in the Academy took the first photograph of a bullet flying at supersonic speed in 1886, devising a technique that was later used by [[Ernst Mach]] in his studies of supersonic motion.<ref>Peter Salcher und Ernst Mach, [http://www.univie.ac.at/pluslucis/PlusLucis/031/s22.pdf Schlierenfotografie von Überschall-Projektilen] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106054333/http://www.univie.ac.at/pluslucis/PlusLucis/031/s22.pdf |date=6 January 2012 }}, W.

Rijeka's port underwent tremendous development fuelled by generous Hungarian investments, becoming the main maritime outlet for Hungary and the eastern part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. By 1913–14, the port of Fiume became the tenth-busiest port in Europe.<ref name=fried2020/> The population grew rapidly from only 21,000 in 1880 to 50,000 in 1910. Major civic buildings constructed at this time include the Governor's Palace, designed by the Hungarian architect [[Alajos Hauszmann]]. There was an ongoing competition between Rijeka and Trieste, the main maritime outlet for Austria—reflecting the rivalry between the two components of the Dual Monarchy. The Austro-Hungarian Navy sought to keep the balance by ordering new warships from the shipyards of both cities.

By religion, the census of 1910 indicates that - from the total of 49,806 inhabitants - there were 45,130 [[Catholics]], 1,696 [[Jewish]], 1,123 [[Calvinist]], 995 [[Eastern orthodox|Orthodox]] and 311 [[Lutheran]]. The Jewish population expanded rapidly, particularly in the 1870s-1880s, and built a [[Rijeka Synagogue|large synagogue]] in 1907 (which would be destroyed in 1944, during the German occupation, concurrent with the murder of most of the city's Jewish residents). On the eve of WWI, there were 165 inns, 10 hotels with restaurants, 17 cafés, 17 jewellers, 37 barbers and 265 tailor shops in Rijeka.<ref name=fried2020/>

=== World War I ===
[[File:Torpedo production in Rijeka.jpg|thumb|right|Torpedo production in Rijeka, c. 1914]]
World War I put an end to Rijeka's "golden era" of peace, stability and rapid economic growth. The city would never quite recover to the same level of prosperity. Initially there was a semblance of normalcy (the city was far from the frontlines), however - a growing part of the male population started to be mobilized by the army and the navy. The city's war-related industries continued to work full steam and contributed significantly to the Austro-Hungarian war effort, especially to the navy. The shipyard [[Ganz Works|Ganz-Danubius]] produced a number of warships and submarines like the [[U-27-class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|U-27-class submarines]], the [[Novara-class cruiser]]s, the large battleship [[SMS Szent István]] and others. In total, between the early 1900s and 1918 the city's shipyards produced 1 battleship, 2 cruisers, 20 destroyers, 32 torpedo boats and 15 submarines for the navy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vecernji.hr/premium/usponi-i-padovi-3-maja-nekad-16-na-svijetu-s-prihodom-od-110-milijuna-dolara-1352081 |title=Usponi i padovi 3. maja: Nekad je bio 16. na svijetu, s prihodom od 110 milijuna dolara - Croatian |publisher=vecernji.hr |access-date=28 May 2021 |archive-date=2 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210602212407/https://www.vecernji.hr/premium/usponi-i-padovi-3-maja-nekad-16-na-svijetu-s-prihodom-od-110-milijuna-dolara-1352081 |url-status=live }}</ref> Rijeka was also the main center for the production of torpedoes. However, a lot changed with the war becoming a protracted conflict and especially with the [[Italian entry into World War I|Italian declaration of war on Austria-Hungary]] in May 1915. This opened a [[Italian front (World War I)|frontline]] only 90&nbsp;km from the city and caused a pervasive sense of anxiety among the large Italian population. Several hundred Italians, considered disloyal (enemy non-combatants) by the authorities, were deported to camps in Hungary ([[Sülysáp|Tápiósüly]] and [[Kiskunhalas]]), where many died of malnutrition and diseases. The torpedo factory was attacked by the Italian [[Rigid airship|airship]] "Citta` di Novara" in 1915 (later shot down by Austrian hydroplanes) and suffered damages. As a consequence - most of the torpedo production was moved to [[Sankt Pölten]] in Austria, further away from the frontlines. The city was again attacked by Italian airplanes in 1916 and suffered minor damage. The Naval Academy ceased its activities and was converted to a war hospital (the ex-naval academy buildings are still housing the city hospital to this day). On 10 February 1918 the Italian navy [[Bakar mockery|raided the nearby bay of Bakar]] causing little material damage but achieving a significant propaganda effect. As the war dragged on, the city's economy and the living standard of the population deteriorated rapidly. Due to a [[Otranto Barrage|maritime blockade]], the port traffic suffered a collapse - from 2,892.538 tons in 1913 (before the war) to only 330.313 tons in 1918. Many factories - lacking manpower and/or raw materials - reduced the production or simply closed. Shortages of food and other basic necessities became widespread. Even public safety became a problem with an increase in the number of thefts, violent incidents and war profiteering.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/147658 |title=Markus Leideck:Crna kronika" (Kriminalfalle) in der Tageszeitung "Riečki novi list" Jahrgang 1914/1915 - German, Croatian |website=[[Hrčak]] |access-date=16 February 2021 |archive-date=31 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210731115141/https://hrcak.srce.hr/147658 |url-status=live }}</ref> The crisis escalated on October 23, 1918, when the Croatian troops stationed in Rijeka (79th regiment) mutinied and temporarily took control of the city.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/49977 |title=Daniel Patafta:Economical Situation in Rijeka From 1918 to 1924 - Croatian |journal=Ekonomska i Ekohistorija: Časopis za Gospodarsku Povijest i Povijest Okoliša |date=25 July 2005 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=115–137 |via=[[Hrčak]] |access-date=12 February 2021 |last1=Patafta |first1=Daniel |archive-date=31 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210731125119/https://hrcak.srce.hr/49977 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=fried2020/><ref>Manfried Rauchensteiner:Prvi Svjetski Rat i Kraj Habsburške Monarhije 1914-1918 - in Croatian, Matica Hrvatska, Zagreb 2019, {{ISBN|978-953-341-102-6}}, page 903-904</ref> Amid growing chaos, the [[Dissolution of Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian empire dissolved]] a few weeks later, on November 12, 1918, starting a long period of instability and uncertainty for the city.

=== The "Fiume Question" and the Italian-Yugoslav dispute ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Porco Rosso]] -->

[[File:Fiume cheering D'Annunzio.jpg|thumb|left|Residents of [[Fiume]] cheering the arrival of [[Impresa di Fiume|Gabriele D'Annunzio and his ''Legionari'']] in September 1919, when Fiume had 22,488 (62% of the population) Italians in a total population of 35,839 inhabitants.]]
[[File:Kaštel Trsat, južne zidine s ulazom.jpg|thumb|left|Trsat castle, south]]

Habsburg-ruled Austria-Hungary's disintegration in October 1918 during the closing weeks of World War I led to the establishment of rival Croatian-Serbian and Italian administrations in the city; both Italy and the founders of the new [[Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) claimed sovereignty based on their "[[irredentist]]" ("unredeemed") ethnic populations.

After a brief military occupation by the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, followed by the unilateral annexation of the former Corpus Separatum by Belgrade, an international force of British, Italian, French and American troops entered the city in November 1918. Its future became a major [[Adriatic Question|barrier to agreement]] during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919. The US president Wilson even proposed to make Rijeka a free city and the headquarters of the newly formed [[League of Nations]].<ref>Stanislav Krakov, Dolazak srpske vojske na Rijeku i severni Jadran, Beograd: ''Jadranska Straza'',1928/29; The Arrival of the Serbian Army in Fiume and the Northern Adriatic</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Gerthrude Slaughter: The Significance of Fiume |journal=The North American Review |volume=210 |issue=768 |date=November 1919 |pages=614–621 |jstor=25120377}}</ref>

[[File:JadranskiTrgRijeka2.png|thumb|Adriatic Square and Adria Palace]]
The main problem arose from the fact that Rijeka was not assigned either to Italy or to Croatia (now Yugoslavia) in the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] which defined the post-war borders in the area. It remained assigned to Austria-Hungary because - until the very end of WWI - it was assumed that the Austro-Hungarian empire would survive WWI in some form and Rijeka was to become its only seaport (Trieste was to be annexed by Italy). However, once the empire disintegrated, the status of the city became disputed. Italy based its claim on the fact that Italians comprised the largest single nationality within the city (46.9% of the total population). Croats made up most of the remainder and were a majority in the surrounding area.<ref name="A.J.P. Taylor 1918">[[A. J. P. Taylor]]: The Habsburg Monarchy, 1809–1918, University of Chicago Press, Paperback edition, 1976, {{ISBN|0-226-79145-9}}, page 269</ref> [[Andrea Ossoinack]], who had been the last delegate from Fiume to the Hungarian Parliament, was admitted to the conference as a representative of Fiume, and essentially supported the Italian claims. Nevertheless, at this point the city had had for years a strong and very active Autonomist Party seeking for Rijeka a special independent status among nations as a multicultural Adriatic city. This movement even had its delegate at the Paris peace conference - Ruggero Gotthardi.

===The Regency of Carnaro===
{{Main|Italian Regency of Carnaro}}
On 10 September 1919, the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain]] was signed, declaring the Austro-Hungarian monarchy dissolved. Negotiations over the future of the city were interrupted two days later when a force of Italian nationalist irregulars led by the poet [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] captured the city.<ref>Ledeen, Michael A. 1977. The First Duce. D'Annunzio at Fiume, Baltimore and London: The Johns Hopkins University Press.</ref> Because the Italian government, wishing to respect its international obligations, did not want to annex Fiume, D'Annunzio and the intellectuals at his side eventually established an independent state, the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]], a unique social experiment for the age and a revolutionary cultural experience in which various international intellectuals of diverse walks of life took part (like [[Osbert Sitwell]], [[Arturo Toscanini]], [[Henry Furst]], [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], [[Harukichi Shimoi]], [[Guglielmo Marconi]], [[Alceste De Ambris]], [[Whitney Warren]] and Léon Kochnitzky).<ref>Ferdinando Gerra, L'impresa di Fiume, Longanesi, Milano, 1974</ref>

Among the many political experiments that took place during this experience, D'Annunzio and his men undertook a first attempt to establish a movement of non-aligned nations in the so-called [[League of Fiume]], an organisation antithetic to the Wilsonian League of Nations, which it saw as a means of perpetuating a corrupt and imperialist ''status quo''. The organisation was aiming primarily at helping all oppressed nationalities in their struggle for political dignity and recognition, establishing links with many movements on various continents, but it never found the necessary external support and its main legacy remains today the Regency of Carnaro's recognition of [[Soviet Russia]], the first state in the world to have done so.<ref>Claudia Salaris, Alla festa della rivoluzione.

Interpretazione del dannunzianesimo", Milano, 1994</ref>
[[File:Granica između Rijeke i Sušaka 1937.JPG|thumb|left|Fiume (Rijeka) in 1937]]

The [[Liberal Union (Italy)|Liberal]] [[Giovanni Giolitti]] became Premier of Italy again in June 1920; this signalled a hardening of official attitudes to D'Annunzio's ''coup''. On 12 November, Italy and Yugoslavia concluded the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]], which envisaged Fiume becoming an independent state, the [[Free State of Fiume]], under a government acceptable to both powers.<ref>Federzoni, Luigi. ''Il Trattato di Rapallo'', Bologna, Zanichelli, 1921.</ref> D'Annunzio's response was characteristically flamboyant and of doubtful judgment: his declaration of war against Italy invited the bombardment by Italian royal forces which led to his surrender of the city at the end of the year, after five days' resistance (known as [[Bloody Christmas (1920)|Bloody Christmas]]). Italian troops freed the city from D'Annunzio's militias in the last days of December 1920. After a world war and additional two years of economic paralysis the city economy was nearing collapse and the population was exhausted.

===The Free State of Fiume===
{{Main|Free State of Fiume}}
In a subsequent democratic election the Fiuman electorate on 24 April 1921 approved the idea of a free state of Fiume-Rijeka with a Fiuman-Italo-Yugoslav consortium ownership structure for the port, giving an overwhelming victory to the independentist candidates of the Autonomist Party. Fiume became consequently a full-fledged member of the League of Nations and the ensuing election of Rijeka's first president, [[Riccardo Zanella]], was met with official recognition and greetings from all major powers and countries worldwide. Despite many positive developments leading to the establishment of the new state's structures, the subsequent formation of a [[constituent assembly]] for the state did not put an end to strife within the city. A brief Italian nationalist seizure of power ended with the intervention of an Italian royal commissioner, and another short-lived peace was interrupted by a local Fascist putsch in March 1922 which ended with a third Italian intervention to restore the previous order. Seven months later the [[Kingdom of Italy]] itself fell under Fascist rule and Fiume's fate was therefore sealed, the [[National Fascist Party|Italian Fascist Party]] being among the strongest proponents of the annexation of Fiume to Italy. The Free State of Fiume thus was to officially become the first country victim of fascist expansionism.

[[File:Capuchin church palace Ploche Rijeka Croatia.jpg|thumb|right|Capuchin Church of Our Lady of Lourdes]]

=== The territory of Fiume part of the Kingdom of Italy ===
The period of diplomatic acrimony was closed by the bilateral [[Treaty of Rome (1924)|Treaty of Rome]] (27 January 1924), signed by Italy and Yugoslavia. With it the two neighbouring countries agreed to partition the territory of the small state. Most of the old Corpus Separatum territory became part of Italy, while a few Croatian/Slovenian-speaking villages to the north of the city were annexed by Yugoslavia.<ref name="Benedetti">Benedetti, Giulio. ''La pace di Fiume'', Bologna, Zanichelli, 1924.</ref> The annexation happened de facto on 16 March 1924, and it inaugurated about twenty years of Italian government for the city proper, to the detriment of the Croatian minority, which fell victim of discrimination and targeted assimilation policies.

The city became the seat of the newly formed [[Province of Fiume]]. In this period Fiume lost its commercial hinterland and thus part of its economic potential as it became a border town with little strategic importance for the Kingdom of Italy. However, since it retained the Free Port status and its iconic image in the nation-building myth, it gained many economic concessions and subsidies from the government in Rome. These included a separate tax treatment from the rest of Italy and a continuous inflow of investments from the Italian state (although not as generous as previous Hungarian ones). The city regained a good level of economic prosperity and was much richer than the surrounding Yugoslav lands, but the economic and demographic growth slowed down if compared to the previous Austro-Hungarian period.<gallery widths="220">

===World War II and the German Operational Zone===

At the beginning of World War II Rijeka immediately found itself in an awkward position. The city's largest demographic was Italian followed by Croatian constituting most of the remainder, but its immediate surroundings and the city of Sušak, just across the Rječina river (today a part of Rijeka proper) were inhabited almost exclusively by Croatians and part of a potentially hostile power—[[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. Once the [[Axis powers]] [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, the Croatian areas surrounding the city were occupied by the Italian military, setting the stage for an intense and bloody insurgency which would last until the end of the war. [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] activity included guerrilla-style attacks on isolated positions or supply columns, sabotage and killings of civilians believed to be connected to the Italian and (later) German authorities. This, in turn, was met by stiff reprisals from the Italian and German military. On 14 July 1942, in reprisal for the killing of four civilians of Italian origin by Partisans, the Italian military killed 100 men from the suburban village of Podhum, resettling the remaining 800 people to concentration camps.<ref>Jozo Tomasevich: War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, Stanford University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8047-3615-4}}, page 134</ref>

After the [[Armistice of Cassibile|surrender of Italy to the Allies]] in September 1943, Rijeka and the surrounding territories were occupied and annexed by Germany, becoming part of the [[Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral|Adriatic Littoral Zone]]. Partisan activity continued and intensified. On 30 April 1944, in the nearby village of Lipa, German troops killed 263 civilians in reprisal for the killing of several soldiers during a Partisan attack.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jutarnji.hr/naslovnica/tajna-rupe-kako-je-nestalo-11.000-vojnika-4021386 |title=Tajna Rupe: Kako je nestalo 11.000 vojnika|date=30 April 2006|language=hr|access-date=28 July 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201205203/http://www.jutarnji.hr/tajna-rupe--kako-je-nestalo-11-000-vojnika/147211 |archive-date=1 February 2010 }}</ref>

The German and Italian occupiers and their local collaborators deported some 80 percent of the city's roughly 500 Jews to [[Auschwitz]]. A larger proportion of Rijeka's Jewish population was murdered in the Holocaust than that of any other city in Italian territory.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/arts/an-italian-saint-in-the-making-or-a-collaborator-with-nazis.html |title=Italian Praised for Saving Jews Is Now Seen as Nazi Collaborator |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 June 2013 |access-date=31 October 2021 |archive-date=31 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211031191036/https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/arts/an-italian-saint-in-the-making-or-a-collaborator-with-nazis.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2013/08/05/203292938/world-war-ii-researchers-say-italian-schindler-was-a-myth |title=World War II Researchers Say 'Italian Schindler' Was A Myth |publisher=National Public Radio |date=5 August 2013 |access-date=31 October 2021 |archive-date=31 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211031191454/https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2013/08/05/203292938/world-war-ii-researchers-say-italian-schindler-was-a-myth |url-status=live }}</ref>

Because of its industries (oil refinery, torpedo factory, shipyards) and its port facilities, the city was also a target of more than 30 Anglo-American air attacks,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edit.hr/lavoce/2010/100430/cultura.htm |title=Fiume 1945, piovono i ricordi – Le conseguenze dei trenta bombardamenti e la difficile ricostruzione |work=[[La Voce del Popolo]] |date=30 April 2010 |author=Gianfranco Miksa |access-date=21 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721154032/http://www.edit.hr/lavoce/2010/100430/cultura.htm |archive-date=21 July 2011 }}</ref> which caused widespread destruction and hundreds of civilian deaths.

The area of Rijeka was [[Alpine Wall|heavily fortified even before World War II]] (the remains of these fortifications can be seen today on the outskirts of the city). This was the fortified border between Italy and Yugoslavia which, at that time, cut across the city area and its surroundings. As Yugoslav troops approached the city in April 1945, one of the fiercest and largest battles in this area of Europe ensued. The 27,000 German and additional Italian [[Italian Social Republic|RSI]] troops fought tenaciously from behind these fortifications (renamed "Ingridstellung"—Ingrid Line—by the Germans). Under the command of the German general [[Ludwig Kübler]] they inflicted thousands of casualties on the attacking Partisans, which were forced by their superiors to charge uphill against well-fortified positions to the north and east of the city. The Yugoslav commanders did not spare casualties to speed up the capture of the city, fearing a possible English landing in area which would prevent their advance towards Trieste before the war was over. After an extremely bloody battle and heavy losses on the attackers side, the Germans were forced to retreat. Before leaving the city the German troops destroyed much of the harbour area and other important infrastructure with explosive charges. However, the German attempt to break out of the encirclement north-west of the city was unsuccessful. Of the approximately 27,000 German and other troops retreating from the city, 11,000 were killed or executed after surrendering{{fact|date=September 2024}}<!--Applies especially to 'executed after surrendering', but also to the number of the retreating soldiers and of the casualties.

The city's fate was once again solved by a combination of force and diplomacy. Despite insistent requests from the Fiuman government in exile collaboration with the partisans and calls to respect the city-state's internationally recognized sovereignty, and despite generous initial promises  given by the Yugoslav authorities of full independence and later of extensive autonomy for the city-state (the locals were promised various degrees of autonomy at different moments during the war, most notably the possibility to be a state of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), the city was annexed by Yugoslavia and incorporated as part of the federal state of Croatia. All the many voices of dissent within the population were silenced in the 12 months following the end of the war. The situation created by the Yugoslav forces on the ground was eventually formalized by the 1947  [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris peace treaty]] between Italy and the Allies on 10 February 1947, despite both the complaints by the last democratically elected government and its president-in-exile Riccardo Zanella and the attempts of the experienced Italian foreign minister [[Carlo Sforza]] to uphold the previous Wilsonian plans for a multicultural Free State solution, with a local headquarters for the newly created [[United Nations]]. Once the change to Yugoslav sovereignty was formalized, and in particular in the years leading to the [[Trieste Crisis]] of 1954, 58,000 of the city's  66,000 inhabitants were gradually pushed  either to emigrate (they became known in Italian as [[Istrian–Dalmatian exodus|''esuli'' or the ''exiled ones'']] from Istria, [[Fiume]] and [[Dalmatia]]) or to endure harsh oppression by the new Yugoslav Communist regime. The [[Yugoslav communist party]] opted for a markedly [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] approach to solving the local ethnic question, in particular after the Autonomist sympathisers gained massive support in the first local elections held on the city's territory between 1945 and 1946.

The discrimination and persecution that many inhabitants experienced at the hands of Yugoslav officials, in the last days of World War II and the first years of peace, still remain painful memories for the locals and the ''esuli,'' and are somewhat of a taboo topic for Rijeka's political milieu, which is still largely denying the events.<ref name="Article">{{Cite web|url=https://www.novilist.hr/rijeka-regija/rijeka/doric-tito-je-bio-celnik-totalitarnog-rezima-i-ne-zasluzuje-rijecki-trg/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029204206/http://www.novilist.hr/Vijesti/Rijeka/Doric-Tito-je-bio-celnik-totalitarnog-rezima-i-ne-zasluzuje-rijecki-trg|url-status=dead|title=Dorić: Tito je bio čelnik totalitarnog režima i ne zaslužuje riječki trg|date=30 August 2013|archivedate=29 October 2013|website=Novi list}}</ref> [[Summary execution]]s of alleged Fascists (often well-known anti-fascists or openly apolitical), aimed at hitting the local intellectual class, the Autonomists, the commercial classes, the former Italian public servants, the military officials and often also ordinary civilians (at least 650 executions of Italians took place after the end of the war<ref name="Study">[http://www.archivi.beniculturali.it/DGA-free/Sussidi/Sussidi_12.pdf Società di Studi Fiumani – Roma – Hrvatski Institut za Povijest – Zagreb,''Le vittime di nazionalita italiana a Fiume e dintorni (1943–1947)'',''Žrtve talijanske nacionalnosti u Rijeci i okolici (1939.-1947 .)'', Rome 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031131611/http://www.archivi.beniculturali.it/DGA-free/Sussidi/Sussidi_12.pdf |date=31 October 2008 }} {{ISBN|88-7125-239-X}}.

The most notable victims of the political and ethnic repression of locals in this period was the [[Fiume Autonomists purge]] hitting all the autonomist figures still living in the city, and now associated in the [[Liburnian Autonomist Movement]]. The Autonomists actively helped the Yugoslav partisans in liberating the region from Fascist and Nazi occupation, and, despite receiving various promises of large political autonomy for the city, they were eventually all assassinated by the Yugoslav secret police [[OZNA]] in the days leading up to the Yugoslav army's victorious march into city and its aftermath.

In subsequent years, the Yugoslav authorities joined the municipalities of Fiume and Sušak and, after 1954, less than one third of the original population of the now united municipalities (mostly what was previously the Croat minority in Fiume and the majority in Sušak) remained in the city, because the old municipality of Fiume lost in these years more than 85% of the original population. The Yugoslav plans for a more obedient demographic situation in RIjeka culminated in 1954 during the Trieste crisis, when the Yugoslav Communist Party rallied many local members to ruin or destroy the most notable vestiges of the Italian/Venetian language and all bilingual inscriptions in the city (which had been legally granted a fully bilingual status after the occupation in 1945), eventually also 'de facto' (but not 'de jure') deleting bilinguilism, except in a handful of selected bilingual schools and inside the Italian Community's own building. After the war the local ethnic Italians of Rijeka left Yugoslavia for Italy ([[Istrian-Dalmatian exodus]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comune.modena.it/istitutostorico/fdownload.php?file=MTIucGRm|title=L'esodo degli italiani dall'Istria e l'insediamento dei profughi nella provincia di Modena|access-date=29 June 2021|archive-date=29 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210629171129/https://www.comune.modena.it/istitutostorico/fdownload.php?file=MTIucGRm|url-status=live}}</ref>

The city was then resettled by immigrants from various parts of Yugoslavia, once more changing heavily the city's demographics and its linguistic composition. These years coincided also with a period of general reconstruction and new program of industrialization after the destruction of the war. During the period of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] Communist administration between the 1950s and the 1980s, the city became the main port of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Federal Republic]] and started to grow once again, both demographically and economically, taking advantage of the newly re-established hinterland that had been lacking during the Italian period, as well as the rebuilding  after the war of its traditional manufacturing industries, its maritime economy and its port potential. This, paired with its rich commercial history, allowed the city to soon become the second richest (GDP per capita) district within [[Yugoslavia]]. However, many of these industries and companies, being based on a socialist planned economic model were not able to survive the move to a market-oriented economy in the early 1990s.

As Yugoslavia broke up in 1991, the former [[Federal State of Croatia]] became independent and, in the [[Croatian War of Independence]] that ensued, Rijeka became part of the newly independent [[Croatia]]. Since then, the city has stagnated economically and its demography has plunged. Some of its largest industries and employers have gone out of business, the most prominent among them being the Jugolinija shipping company, the torpedo factory, the paper mill and many other small or medium manufacturing and commercial companies. Other companies have struggled to remain economically viable (like the city's landmark [[3. Maj]] shipyard). The number of people working in manufacturing dropped from more than 80,000 in 1990 to only 5,000 two decades later{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}}. Privatization scandals and the large scale corruption which marked Croatia's transition from socialism to capitalism as well as several years of [[Yugoslav wars|war economy]] played a significant role in the collapse of the city's economy during the 1990s and early 2000s. A difficult and uncertain transition of the city's economy away from manufacturing and towards an economy based on services and tourism is still in progress.

In 2018, it was announced that, 65 years after the abolition of Italian as the official language of the city, new Croatian-Italian bilingual signs will be placed back in the Fiume part of the modern united municipality.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/cronache/fiume-torna-italiana-arriva-segnaletica-bilingue-rijeka-1581493.html|title=Fiume "torna" italiana: arriva la segnaletica bilingue per Rijeka|work=ilGiornale.it|access-date=2018-10-09|language=it|archive-date=10 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010012502/http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/cronache/fiume-torna-italiana-arriva-segnaletica-bilingue-rijeka-1581493.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Rijeka's International Carnival ==
{{main|Rijeka Carnival}}
The Rijeka Carnival (Croatian: ''Riječki karneval'') is held each year before Lent (between late January and early March) in Rijeka, Croatia. Established in 1982, it has become the biggest carnival in Croatia. Every year there are numerous events preceding the carnival itself. First the mayor of Rijeka gives the symbolic key of the city to Meštar Toni, who is "the maestro" of the carnival, and he becomes the mayor of the city during the carnival, although this is only figuratively. Same day, there is an election of the carnival queen. As all the cities around Rijeka have their own events during the carnival time, Queen and Meštar Toni are attending most of them.
[[File:RijekaCarnival18x.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rijeka Carnival]]]]
Also, every year the Carnival charity ball is held in the Governor's palace in Rijeka. It is attended by politicians, people from sport and media life, as well as a number of ambassadors.

The weekend before the main event there are two other events held. One is Rally Paris–Bakar (after the [[Dakar Rally]]). The start is a part of Rijeka called Paris after the restaurant located there, and the end is in city of Bakar, located about {{convert|20|km|abbr=off}} south-east. All of the participants of the rally wear masks, and the cars are mostly modified old cars. The other event is the children's carnival, held, like the main one, on Rijeka's main walkway Korzo. The groups that participate are mostly from kindergartens and elementary schools, including groups from other parts of Croatia and neighboring countries. In 1982 there were only three masked groups on Rijeka's main walkway Korzo. In recent years, the international carnival has attracted around 15,000 participants from all over the world organized in over 200 carnival groups, with crowds of over 100,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rijecki-karneval.hr/|title=Riječki karneval - Maškare i mesopust u Rijeci|first=Multilink|last=d.o.o.|website=www.rijecki-karneval.hr|access-date=10 August 2018|archive-date=8 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808161509/http://www.rijecki-karneval.hr/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Boundaries of Rijeka are sometimes extended into the adjoining areas. The former municipality of Rijeka (20th century) consists of other towns and municipalities outside Rijeka city proper, which used to be part of an official union of adjacent settlements that was disbanded in 1995. It includes towns and municipalities of [[Kastav]], [[Viškovo]], [[Klana]], [[Kostrena]], [[Čavle]], [[Jelenje]], [[Bakar, Croatia|Bakar]] and [[Kraljevica]].

The [[urban agglomeration]] of Rijeka includes the former municipality along with the towns and municipalities of [[Opatija]], [[Lovran]], [[Mošćenička Draga]] and [[Matulji]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Urbana aglomeracija - Grad Rijeka|url=https://www.rijeka.hr/urbana-aglomeracija/|publisher=Grad Rijeka|language=hr}}</ref>

The artistic process is inspired by the theme of [[Professor Balthazar]], the world-famous and award-winning animated series, in which the scenographer used Rijeka as the primary inspiration in the creation of Balthazartown.

==Climate==
[[File:Sablicevorijeka.jpg|thumb|left|Sablićevo Beach]]
[[File:Platak snowboarding 0110 2.jpg|thumb|[[Platak]] ski resort, north of Rijeka|left]]
Rijeka has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (Cfa by the [[Köppen climate classification]]) with warm summers and relatively mild and rainy winters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.climate-data.org/europe/croatia/kvarner-10028/https://en.climate-data.org/europe/croatia/kvarner-10028/|title=Kvarner Climate|work=climate-data.org|language=en|access-date=17 January 2020}}{{Dead link|date=February 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The terrain configuration, with mountains rising steeply just a few kilometres inland from the shores of the Adriatic, provides for some striking climatic and landscape contrasts within a small geographic area. Beaches can be enjoyed throughout summer in a typically [[Mediterranean]] setting along the coastal areas of the city to the east (Pećine, [[Kostrena]]) and west (Kantrida, Preluk). At the same time, the ski resort of [[Platak]], located only about {{convert|10|km}} from the city, offers [[alpine skiing]] and abundant snow during winter months (at times until early May). The [[Kvarner Bay]] and its islands are visible from the ski slopes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://platak.hr/|title=platak.hr|language=hr|access-date=11 February 2021|archive-date=17 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210117100812/https://platak.hr/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kvarner.hr/turizam/otkrijte_kvarner/primorje/Rijeka_i_rijecki_prsten/Aktivnosti|title=Aktivnosti|work=kvarner.hr|language=hr|access-date=14 November 2014|archive-date=29 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129023629/http://www.kvarner.hr/turizam/otkrijte_kvarner/primorje/Rijeka_i_rijecki_prsten/Aktivnosti|url-status=live}}</ref>

There are 20 days a year with a maximum of {{cvt|30|C}} or higher, while on one day a year the temperature does not exceed {{cvt|0|C}}.<ref name=normals/> Fog appears in about four days per year, mainly in winter.<ref name=normals/> The climate is also characterized by frequent rainfall. Cold ([[bora (wind)|bora]]) winds are common in wintertime.

The Port of Rijeka is the largest port in Croatia, with a cargo throughput in 2017 of 12.6&nbsp;million tonnes, mostly crude oil and refined petroleum products, general cargo and [[bulk cargo]], and 260,337 [[twenty-foot equivalent unit]]s (TEUs).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.portauthority.hr/en/documents/Statistika+za+web+stranicu+-+ENG.pdf |title=Portauthority.hr |access-date=2 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104005504/http://www.portauthority.hr/en/documents/Statistika+za+web+stranicu+-+ENG.pdf |archive-date=4 November 2016 }}</ref> The port is managed by the Port of Rijeka Authority. The first record of a port in Rijeka date back to 1281, and in 1719, the Port of Rijeka was granted a charter as a free port. There are ferry connections between Rijeka and the surrounding islands and cities, but no direct international passenger ship connections. There are coastal lines to [[Split, Croatia|Split]] and onward to [[Dubrovnik]], which operate twice weekly and have international connections.

The city is difficult to get to by air outside of the tourist season. The city's own international airport, [[Rijeka Airport]] is located on the nearby island of Krk across the [[Krk Bridge]]. Buses, with a journey time of approximately 45 minutes, operate from Rijeka city center and nearby [[Opatija]], with a schedule based on the planned arrival and departure times of flights. Handling 200,841 passengers in 2019, the facility is more of a charter airport than a serious [[transport hub]], although various scheduled airlines have begun to service it with a comparatively large number of flights coming from airports in [[Germany]]. Most of these flights only operate during the tourist season between approximately May and October. Alternative nearby airports include [[Pula Airport|Pula]] (around 90 minutes drive from Rijeka), [[Trieste Airport|Trieste]] (around 90 minutes), [[Ljubljana Jože Pučnik Airport|Ljubljana]] (around 2 hours), [[Zagreb Airport|Zagreb]] (around 2 hours) and [[Venice Marco Polo Airport|Venice]] (around 3 hours).

Rijeka has efficient road connections to other parts of Croatia and neighbouring countries. The [[A6 (Croatia)|A6 motorway]] connects Rijeka to Zagreb via the [[A1 (Croatia)|A1]], while the [[A7 (Croatia)|A7 motorway]], completed in 2004, links Rijeka with Ljubljana, Slovenia, via [[Ilirska Bistrica]] and with Trieste, Italy. The A7 acts as the Rijeka bypass motorway and facilitates access to the [[A8 (Croatia)|A8 motorway]] of the [[Istrian Y]] network starting with the [[Učka Tunnel]], and linking Rijeka with Istria. As of August 2011, the bypass is being extended eastwards to the Krk Bridge area and new feeder roads are under construction.

Rijeka is integrated into the [[Croatian Railways|Croatian railway]] network and international rail lines. A fully electrified railway connects Rijeka to Zagreb and beyond towards [[Koprivnica]] and the Hungarian border as part of [[Pan-European corridors|Pan-European corridor Vb]]. Rijeka is also connected to Trieste and Ljubljana by a separate electrified line that extends northwards from the city. Rijeka has direct connections by daily/night trains to Prague, München, Salzburg, Ljubljana, Bratislava and Brno. Construction of a new high performance railway between Rijeka and Zagreb, extending to Budapest is planned, as well as rail links connecting Rijeka to the island of Krk and between Rijeka and [[Pula]].

=== Bus connections ===
Rijeka Bus Station is connected by regular bus lines with all major Croatian cities such as Zagreb, Osijek, Slavonski Brod, Đakovo, Nova Gradiška, Požega, Vukovar, Gospić, Karlovac, Zadar, Šibenik, Split, Makarska and Dubrovnik. Departures are frequent in the direction of Istria, the islands of Cres, Lošinj, Krk, Rab and Pag and the towns around Crikvenica, Novi Vinodolski and Senj. From international lines, there are regular departures in the direction of Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Autobusni Kolodvor Rijeka, kontakt, vozni red i radno vrijeme {{!}} Arriva Hrvatska |url=https://www.arriva.com.hr/hr-hr/kvarner/rijeka |access-date=2022-06-10 |website=www.arriva.com.hr |archive-date=2 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220702194733/https://www.arriva.com.hr/hr-hr/kvarner/rijeka |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Sports==
The history of Rijeka's organised sports started between 1885 and 1888 with the foundation of the Club Alpino Fiumano in 1885, the Young American Cycle Club in 1887 (the first club of this American league to be founded in a foreign land), and the Nautico Sport Club Quarnero in 1888 by the Hungarian minority of the city. Even earlier, in 1873, following the initiative by Robert Whitehead, the first [[association football|football]] match to be disputed in today's Republic of Croatia territory was played in Rijeka: the Hungarian Railways team and the English engineers-led team of the Stabilimento Tecnico di Fiume (later Torpedo Factory of Fiume). The first football club in Fiume was founded under the name of Fiumei Atletikai Club.

Today, [[HNK Rijeka]] is the city's main football team, which competes in the [[Croatian Football League]]. They were the champions of Croatia in [[2016–17 Croatian First Football League|2016–17]]. Until July 2015, HNK Rijeka was based at the iconic [[Stadion Kantrida]]. With Kantrida awaiting reconstruction, they are based at the newly built [[Stadion Rujevica]], their temporary home in the club's new training camp. Additionally, [[HNK Orijent]] is based in [[Sušak, Rijeka|Sušak]] and plays in the [[First Football League (Croatia)|First Football League]] (second tier).

Rijeka's other notable sports clubs include [[RK Zamet]] and [[ŽRK Zamet]] ([[handball]]), [[Primorje EB|VK Primorje EB]] ([[water polo]]), [[KK Kvarner 2010|KK Kvarner]] ([[basketball]]) and [[ŽOK Rijeka]] (women's [[volleyball]]).

Between 1969 and 1990, Rijeka hosted the [[Yugoslav motorcycle Grand Prix]] that was part of the [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing]]. Rijeka also hosted the [[European Short Course Swimming Championships 2008|2008 European Short Course Swimming Championships]]. In over 80 years, LEN had never seen so many records as the number set at ''Bazeni Kantrida'' (Kantrida Swimming Complex). A total of 14 European records were set, of which 10 were world records, and even 7 were world-best times. This championship also presented a record in the number of participating countries. There were more than 600 top athletes from some 50 European countries. Swimmers from 21 nations won medals, and 40 of the 51 national member Federations of LEN were present in Rijeka.
