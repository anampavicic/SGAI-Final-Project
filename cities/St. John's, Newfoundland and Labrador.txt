In the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], it is a common belief the name of St. John's was given by Basque fishermen because the bay of St. John's is very similar to the Bay of [[Pasaia]] in the Basque Country, where one of the fishing towns is called St. John (in Spanish, San Juan, and in [[Basque language|Basque]], Donibane).<ref name="kiosk"/>

The earliest record of the location appears as ''São João'' on a Portuguese map by [[Pedro Reinel]] in 1519. When the English mariner [[John Rut]] visited St. John's [[Rut's voyage|in 1527]], he found [[Normans|Norman]], [[Brittany|Breton]] and Portuguese ships in the harbour. On 3 August 1527, Rut wrote a letter to King Henry on the findings of his voyage to North America; this was the first known letter sent from North America. St. Jehan is shown on Nicolas Desliens's world map of 1541, and San Joham is found in João Freire's Atlas of 1546.<ref name="The Early Settlement of St. John's">{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/stjohns.html |title=The Early Settlement of St. John's |publisher=Heritage.nf.ca |access-date=2 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106145218/http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/stjohns.html |archive-date=6 January 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On 5 August 1583, an English [[Elizabethan Sea Dogs|Sea Dog]], Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]], claimed the area as England's first overseas colony under [[Royal Charter]] of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].<ref name="Gilbert">{{cite DCB |title=Gilbert, Sir Humphrey |first=David B. |last=Quinn |volume=1 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/gilbert_humphrey_1E.html }}</ref> There was no permanent population, however, and Gilbert was lost at sea during his return voyage, thereby ending any immediate plans for settlement.<ref name="kiosk"/>

[[Newfoundland expedition (1585)|Bernard Drake's Newfoundland Expedition in 1585]] landed at Saint John's, re-establishing England's claim on the area. St. John's became a base for his operations, where his ships gathered supplies and fresh water. This expedition virtually wiped out the Spanish and Portuguese fishing-industries in the area, and so set the stage for subsequent English and French influence in the region.

By 1620, the fishermen of England's [[West Country]] controlled most of Newfoundland's east coast.<ref name="Brief History">{{cite web |url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/newfoundland.htm |title=Newfoundland: Brief History |author=Stephen Luscombe |work=The British Empire |access-date=16 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120015623/http://britishempire.co.uk/maproom/newfoundland.htm |archive-date=20 November 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1627, William Payne, called St. John's "the principal prime and chief lot in all the whole country".<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Early Settlement of St. John's |url=https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/exploration/st-johns-early-settlement.php |url-status=live |access-date=28 June 2021 |website=heritage.nf.ca |archive-date=29 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210629001405/https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/exploration/st-johns-early-settlement.php }}</ref>

Sometime after 1630, the town of St. John's was established as a permanent community. Before this, English fishermen were expressly forbidden by the English government, at the urging of the West Country fishing industry, to establish permanent settlements along the English-controlled coast.<ref name="Higgins">{{cite web |last=Higgins |first=Jenny |title=Migratory Fishery and Settlement Patterns |url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/settlement_patterns.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112065711/http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/settlement_patterns.html |archive-date=12 November 2013 |access-date=20 September 2013 |work=Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage |publisher=N&L Heritage Website }}</ref>

The population grew slowly in the 17th century: St. John's was Newfoundland's largest settlement when English naval officers began to take censuses around 1675.<ref name="The Early Settlement of St. John's"/> The population grew in the summers with the arrival of migratory fishermen.<ref name="kiosk"/> In 1680, fishing ships (mostly from South [[Devon]]) set up fishing rooms at St. John's, bringing hundreds of Irish men into the port to operate inshore fishing boats.<ref name="The Early Settlement of St. John's"/>

The town's first significant defences were likely erected due to commercial interests, following the [[Raid on Newfoundland (1665)|temporary seizure of St. John's]] by the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] admiral [[Michiel de Ruyter]] in June 1665.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

The inhabitants fended off a second Dutch attack in 1673, when it was defended by Christopher Martin, an English merchant captain. Martin landed six cannons from his vessel, the ''Elias Andrews'', and constructed an earthen breastwork and battery near Chain Rock commanding the Narrows leading into the harbour. With only 23 men, the valiant Martin beat off an attack by three Dutch warships. The English government planned to expand these fortifications ([[Fort William, Newfoundland|Fort William]]) in around 1689, but construction did not begin until after the French admiral [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] captured and destroyed the town in the [[Avalon Peninsula Campaign]] (1696).

====The oldest European settlement in Anglophone North America controversy====
There has been some controversy regarding which European settlement is the oldest in Anglophone North America. As mentioned above, while English fishermen had set up seasonal camps in St. John's in the 16th century, they were expressly forbidden by the English government, at the urging of the West Country fishing industry, to establish permanent settlements along the English-controlled coast. As a result, the town of St. John's was not established as a permanent community until after the 1630s.<ref name="Higgins"/> With respect to the oldest surviving permanent [[Colonial empire of the Kingdom of England|English settlements]] in North America, it was preceded by [[Jamestown, Virginia]] (1607),<ref>{{cite web |title=Jamestown, A Place of Many Beginnings |url=http://www.nps.gov/jame/index.htm |publisher=US National Park Service website |access-date=20 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830092626/http://www.nps.gov/jame/index.htm |archive-date=30 August 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> the [[Cuper's Cove, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cuper's Cove]] colony at [[Cupids, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cupids]] in Newfoundland (1610), [[St. George's, Bermuda]] (1612),<ref>{{cite web |title=Historic Town of St George and Related Fortifications, Bermuda |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/983 |publisher=UNESCO |access-date=20 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055045/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/983 |archive-date=21 September 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the [[Subdivision 1I, Newfoundland and Labrador#Bristol's Hope|Bristol's Hope]] colony at [[Harbour Grace]] in Newfoundland (1618).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=2223 |title=The 400th Anniversary of Cupids, NL&nbsp;– the Oldest English Colony in Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |date=14 September 2008 |access-date=10 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513200226/http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=2223 |archive-date=13 May 2011 }}</ref> Each of these English settlements were far later than other European settlements in North America, such as [[St. Augustine, Florida]] established by Spain in 1565.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2015/02/28/389682893/not-so-fast-jamestown-st-augustine-was-here-first |title=Not So Fast, Jamestown: St. Augustine Was Here First |website=NPR |access-date=5 November 2019 |archive-date=5 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105232732/https://www.npr.org/2015/02/28/389682893/not-so-fast-jamestown-st-augustine-was-here-first |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Modern history (1800–present)===
On 24 April 1800, the [[United Irish Uprising in Newfoundland|"United Irish Uprising"]] occurred when 19 Irish soldiers who were part of the British garrison stationed in Newfoundland [[mutinied]]. The mutineers, who were suspected to be members of the [[Society of United Irishmen]], fled to the countryside after the mutiny failed, and were apprehended in a matter of weeks and [[court-martial]]led. Of the 17 mutineers captured, 8 were executed, 4 were let go while 5 were sentenced to [[penal transportation]].<ref name="UIU">{{Cite web |url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/society/united-irish-uprising.php |title=The United Irish Uprising in Newfoundland, 1800 |access-date=28 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227061849/http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/society/united-irish-uprising.php |archive-date=27 December 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The 18th century saw major changes in Newfoundland: population growth, beginnings of government, establishment of churches, reinforcement of commercial ties with North America and development of the seal, salmon and [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland|Grand Banks]] fisheries. St. John's population grew slowly. Although it was primarily a fishing station, it was also a [[garrison]], a centre of government and a commercial hub. St. John's served as a naval base during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the [[War of 1812]].<ref name="The Early Settlement of St. John's"/>

====Fires====
St. John's was destroyed by major fires in 1816, 1817, 1819, 1846 and 1892, when each time a large part of the city was destroyed. The most famous was the [[Great Fire of 1892]].<ref name="City of Fire">{{cite book |author=Paul Butler |title=St. John's: City of Fire |date=22 August 2007 |publisher=Flanker Press |isbn=978-1-897317-11-2 }}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2020}}

On 12 February 1816:
<blockquote>...about eight o'clock, a fire broke out in a house in a part of the town in St. John's in Newfoundland known by the name of the King's Beach, and speedily communicated to the houses adjoining, and burnt with so much fury, that one hundred and twenty houses, the homes of about a thousand men, women, and children, were consumed before the conflagration was stayed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pedley |first=Charles |title=The History of Newfoundland |publisher=Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts, and Green |year=1863 |url=https://archive.org/details/historynewfound01pedlgoog |page=[https://archive.org/details/historynewfound01pedlgoog/page/n323 299] }}</ref></blockquote>

There were two citywide fires in 1817 "known jointly as 'The Great Fire of 1817'.<ref>Butler, p.7.</ref> Then in 1819 fire "destroyed 120 houses".<ref>Butler, 13.</ref>

There was [[Great Fire of 1846|a further major fire in 1846]], which started at the shop of a cabinetmaker named Hamlin, located on George Street off Queen Street, when a glue pot boiled over. The fire spread along Water and Duckworth Streets destroying all of the buildings in its path aided by the large quantities of seal oil that were stored in the merchants' premises. The fire was also aided by an attempt to blow up a house on Water Street which scattered burning embers across the city.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/politics/st-johns-fire-1846.php |title="The Great Fire of 1846", Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage. |access-date=24 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191024232003/https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/politics/st-johns-fire-1846.php |archive-date=24 October 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The final major conflagration of the nineteenth century began on the afternoon of 8 July 1892 atop Carter's Hill on Freshwater Road. Initially, the fire did not cause any widespread panic; however, a series of catastrophic coincidences caused the fire to spread and devour virtually all of the east end of the city, including much of its major commercial area, before being extinguished.<ref>[https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/politics/st-johns-fire-1892.php "The St. John's Fire of 1892", Heritage Newfoundland and Labrador] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191024232002/https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/politics/st-johns-fire-1892.php |date=24 October 2019 }}.</ref>

This winter precipitation maximum is unusual for humid continental climates, which typically have a late spring or early summer precipitation maximum (for example, most of the [[Midwestern United States]]). Most heavy precipitation events in St. John's are the product of intense mid-latitude storms from the Northeastern United States and [[New England]] states, and these are most common and intense from October to March, bringing heavy precipitation (commonly {{cvt|40|to|80|mm}} of rainfall equivalent in a single storm), and strong winds.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Snowfall is heavy, averaging approximately {{cvt|363.4|cm}} per winter season. However, winter storms can bring changing precipitation types. Heavy snow can turn into heavy rain, melting the snow cover, and possibly back to snow or ice (perhaps briefly) all in the same storm, resulting in little or no net snow accumulation.

St. John's architecture has a distinct style different from the rest of Canada, and its major buildings are remnants of its history as one of the first British colonial capitals. Buildings took a variety of styles according to the means available to build them.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Starting as a fishing outpost for European fishermen, St. John's consisted mostly of the homes of fishermen, sheds, storage shacks, and wharves constructed out of wood. Like many other cities of the time, as the Industrial Revolution took hold and new methods and materials for construction were introduced, the landscape changed as the city grew. [[The Great Fire of 1892]] destroyed most of the downtown core, and most residential and other wood-frame buildings date from this period.<ref name="City of Fire"/>{{page needed|date=August 2020}}

To meet the need for more office space downtown without compromising the city's heritage, the city council amended heritage regulations, which originally restricted height to {{cvt|15|m}} in the area of land on Water Street between Bishop's Cove and Steer's Cove, to create the "Commercial Central Retail – West Zone". The new zone will allow for buildings of greater height. A {{cvt|47|m}}, 12-storey office building, which includes retail space and a parking garage, was the first building to be approved in this area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stjohns.ca/pdfs/1832-01%20LUAR%20FINAL_351%20Water%20St.%202010%20May%2028.pdf |author=PHB Group, Inc. |title=Land Use Assessment Report: Proposed Office and Parking Building – 351 Water Street |date=May 2010 |page=16 |access-date=2 January 2011}} {{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

[[CJON-DT]], known on air as "NTV", is an [[independent station]]. The station sublicenses entertainment programming from [[Global Television Network|Global]] and news programming from [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and Global, rather than purchasing primary broadcast rights. [[Rogers Cable]] has its provincial headquarters in St. John's, and their community channel [[Rogers TV]] airs local shows such as ''Out of the Fog'' and ''One Chef One Critic''. [[CBC Television]] (CBC) has its Newfoundland and Labrador headquarters in the city and their television station [[CBNT-DT]] broadcasts from University Avenue.

The city is home to 15 AM and FM radio stations, two of which are [[French-language]] stations. The [[ITU prefix]] ''VO'' was assigned to the Dominion of Newfoundland before the province joined [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1949, and three [[AM broadcasting|AM]] stations kept their existing call letters. However, other commercial radio stations in St. John's that went to air after 1949 use the same range of prefixes (''CF''–''CK'') currently in use elsewhere in Canada, with the exception of [[VOCM-FM]], which was permitted to adopt the VOCM callsign because of its corporate association with the AM station that bore that callsign. VO remains in use in [[amateur radio]].

''allNewfoundlandLabrador'' is the city's daily [[online newspaper]], which focuses on business news from across the province.<ref name=brad>{{cite news |last1=Bradshaw |first1=James |title=Subscription news site AllNovaScotia expands to Newfoundland |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/subscription-news-site-allnovascotia-expands-to-newfoundland/article28830527/ |website=Globe and Mail |date=22 February 2016 |agency=Thomson Reuters |access-date=13 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022021135/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/subscription-news-site-allnovascotia-expands-to-newfoundland/article28830527/ |archive-date=22 October 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>
