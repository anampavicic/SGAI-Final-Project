'''Maturín''' ({{IPA|es|matuˈɾin}}) is a city in Venezuela, the capital of the [[Venezuela]]n [[States of Venezuela|state]] of [[Monagas]] and a centre for instrumental exploration and development of the petroleum industry in Venezuela. The metropolitan area of Maturín has a population of 401,384 inhabitants. Maturín is also a busy regional transportation hub, connecting routes from the northeastern coast to the [[Orinoco Delta]] and the [[Gran Sabana]].

== History ==
=== Founding ===
December 7, 1760, is the official date of the founding of Maturín (according to the [[National Academy of History|Venezuelan Academy of History]]) by the Franciscan missionary Lucas de Zaragoza. However, the Jesuit priest Pablo Ojer found a document in the [[General Archive of the Indies]] which proves an earlier founding date for the city in 1722.<ref name=autogenerated1>González Oropeza, Hermann (1985): Historia del Estado Monagas. Ediciones Amon C.A., Caracas. (Biblioteca de Temas y Autores Monaguenses; Colección Guanipa; ensayos e investigación).</ref> This primitive town was called {{Lang|es|San Juan de la Tornera de Maturín}} and its founder was the Spanish governor Juan de la Tornera y Sota.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> San Juan de la Tornera de Maturín was a city for Spaniards, but it did not survive very long because of the lack of population and few economic resources. Initially, {{Lang|es|San Judas Tadeo de Maturín}} (Lucas de Zaragoza gave this name to Maturín) was a Spanish mission created for the conversion of the nearby [[Indigenous peoples of South America|native]] {{Ill|Chaima people|lt=Chaima|es|Chaima}} and [[Warao people|Warao]] people. The Spaniards decided to move to Maturín and in the 19th century it received the category of city and the name of {{Lang|es|San Fernando de Maturín}}.

=== Origin of the name Maturín ===
[[File:Martin_Tovar_y_Tovar_28.JPG|thumb|180px|Portrait of [[José Tadeo Monagas]].]]
Maturín was named after an indigenous chief ([[cacique]]) who lived with his tribe next to the bank of [[Guarapiche River]]. He was murdered by a supposed Spanish captain named Arrioja during a battle between tribal members and Spaniards on the site of the town in 1718. Since then the area has been known as {{Lang|es|el Sitio de Maturín}} ('the place of Maturín').

Some historians{{Who?|date=October 2022}} have concluded that the name Maturín is instead of French origin. They base their theory on the legend of a supposed French missionary who explored the area at the end of the 17th century. The legend says that the missionary (whose surname might have been Mathurin) baptized a young indigenous boy and gave him the name Mathurin,<ref name=autogenerated1 /> the boy later becoming {{Lang|es|el indio Maturín}}. There is also the possibility that the boy may have been named after a 4th-century French saint, [[Maturinus|Saint Mathurin]]. However, the legend of this supposed French missionary has not been proved yet. Other historians disagree with the theory, arguing that there is a plant with the same name and indigenous place names very similar to the name ''Maturín''.

=== Independence war ===
{{main|Battle of Maturín (disambiguation){{!}}Battles of Maturín}}
Maturín (as a part of the [[Province of Cumaná]]) was on the republican side during the [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence]] on July 5, 1811. Five battles took place in Maturín from 1813 to 1814, including the famous [[Battle of Alto de los Godos]]. In this battle the Venezuelan patriots, led by [[Manuel Piar]], obtained a great victory against the Spanish general [[Juan Domingo de Monteverde]]. [[Antonio José de Sucre]], [[José Francisco Bermúdez]], [[José Tadeo Monagas]], [[José Gregorio Monagas]] and [[José Félix Ribas]] were others who fought in the five battles. 

The last battle of Maturín (December 1814), however, was a defeat. During the [[1814 Caracas Exodus]], many soldiers and civilians who had escaped from Caracas during the military campaign of [[José Tomás Boves]] against the Republic, came to Maturín to shelter from the Spanish troops. After the battle of Urica (where Boves died) Tomás José Morales, a Spanish general, decided to take the town. The Republicans defended the town, but they were beaten and many of them were murdered by Morales. The town was destroyed. Some survivors of the last battle rebuilt Maturín two years later.

===19th and 20th centuries ===
Maturín grew slowly during the 19th century due to civil wars (which destroyed the region's flourishing farming and livestock-raising industries and killed many people) and fatal diseases, such as malaria and yellow fever, transmitted by mosquitoes. In 1909 Maturín became capital of the new [[Monagas (state)|Monagas state]]. Before that the town was the capital of the Province Maturín from 1856 to 1859. In the 20th century Maturín grew rapidly due to the discovery of petroleum fields near the town and a health campaign carried out by doctors to eliminate mosquitoes. Maturín has been the headquarters of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Maturín]] since 1958.

== Geography ==
Maturin is located at 67&nbsp;meters of altitude and 520&nbsp;kilometres from the country's capital, [[Caracas]]. It is right next to the Guarapiche River and is a crossroad for roads towards the center, the Caribbean coast and the [[Orinoco River]]

===Climate===
Maturín features a [[tropical savannah climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: '''Aw''').
