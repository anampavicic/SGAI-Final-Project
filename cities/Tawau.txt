'''Tawau''' ({{IPA|zsm|ˈta wau|lang}}), formerly known as '''Tawao''', is the capital of the [[Tawau District]] in [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]]. It is the third-largest city (or town)<ref group="note">While Tawau have a population of more than 100,000 of which is considered city elsewhere in the world it is officially referred as "bandar" (town) in Malay language due to Malaysian law have multiple criteria for a town to be considered a city including a population of more than 500,000 (such as [[George Town, Penang]]), administrative centre of a state (such as [[Kuching]], a state capital of [[Sarawak]] despite it's smaller 300,000 population) and income of RM100 million.</ref> in Sabah, after [[Kota Kinabalu]] and [[Sandakan]]. It is located on the [[Semporna Peninsula]] in the southeast coast of the state in the administrative centre of [[Tawau Division]], which is bordered by the [[Sulu Sea]] to the east, the [[Celebes Sea]] to the south at [[Cowie Bay]]<ref group="note">Cowie Bay in the early 19th century was known as Kalabakong Bay. It is also known as Sibuco Bay.</ref> and shares a border with [[North Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]]. The town had an estimated population {{As of|2010|lc=y}}, of 113,809,<ref name="pop">{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/population/04Jadual_PBT_negeri/PBT_Sabah.pdf|title=Total population by ethnic group, Local Authority area and state, Malaysia, 2010|publisher=Department of Statistics Malaysia|access-date=14 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114184319/http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/population/04Jadual_PBT_negeri/PBT_Sabah.pdf|archive-date=14 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> while the whole municipality area had a population of 397,673 (including 47,466 in Kalabakan, subsequently split off to form a separate district).<ref name="pop"/><ref name="census" group="note">Above the official figures of the 2010 Census, there are a large number of illegal immigrants from Indonesia and the Philippines.(Goodlet, page 248 and page 299)</ref> The municipal area had a population of 372,615 at the 2020 Census.<ref>Dept. of Statistics Malaysia (web).</ref>

Before the founding of Tawau, the region around it was the subject of dispute between the British and Dutch spheres of influence. In 1893, the first British merchant vessel sailed into Tawau, marking the opening of the town's seaport. In 1898, the British set up a settlement in Tawau. The [[North Borneo Chartered Company]] (BNBC) accelerated growth of the settlement's population by encouraging the immigration of Chinese. Consequent to the [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|Japanese occupation of North Borneo]], the Allied forces bombed the town in mid-1944, razing it to the ground. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, 2,900 Japanese soldiers in Tawau became prisoners of war and were transferred to [[Jesselton]]. Tawau was rebuilt after the war, and by the end of 1947, the economy was restored to its pre-war status. Tawau was also the main point of conflict during the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation]] from 1963 to 1966. During that period, it was garrisoned by the British [[Special Boat Service|Special Boat Section]], and guarded by Australian Destroyers and combat aircraft. In December 1963, Tawau was bombed twice by Indonesia and shootings occurred across the Tawau-[[Sebatik Island]] international border. Indonesians were found trying to poison the town's water supply. In January 1965, a curfew was imposed to prevent Indonesian attackers from making contact with Indonesians living in the town. While in June 1965, another attempted invasion by the Indonesian forces was repelled by bombardment by an Australian destroyer. Military conflict finally ended in December 1966.

Among the tourist attractions in Tawau are: the Tawau International Cultural Festival, [[Tawau Bell Tower]], [[Tawau Japanese War Memorial|Japanese War Cemetery]], Confrontation Memorial, Teck Guan Cocoa Museum, [[Tawau Hills National Park]], Bukit Gemok, and Tawau Tanjung Markets. The main economic activities of the town are: timber, cocoa, oil palm plantations, and prawn farming.

On 16 December 1941, during World War II, the [[Battle of Borneo (1941–42)|Japanese invasion of Borneo]] began. After the first landing in [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]], the Japanese moved along the coastline of Borneo from the oil fields of [[Kuching]] and towards [[Kota Kinabalu|Jesselton]]. Life in Tawau continued as usual until 24 January 1942 when the Japanese were sighted off Batu Tinagat. The district officer Cole Adams and his assistant were expecting an attack at the shipyard but were instead arrested by the Japanese.<ref group="note">Cole Adams spent 44 months in Japanese POW camps – first on the [[Berhala Island, Sabah|Berhala Island]] in Sandakan, later in [[Batu Lintang camp]] near Kuching – and died on the day of his liberation by the [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Division of the Australian armed forces]] in September 1945.</ref> The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] began counterattacking the Japanese in mid-1944 with the bombing of Tawau.

At the end of the war, the town had been largely destroyed by bombing and fire; the Bell tower was the only intact pre-war structure. Tawau quickly recovered. Though almost all the shops were destroyed, a report by ''The British North Borneo Annual Report in 1947'' wrote that "the pre-war economy was largely made towards the end of 1947". In the first six months post-war, the British rebuilt 170 shops and commercial buildings. By 1 July 1947, subsidies for the purchase of rice and flour were introduced.<ref>Goodlet, Page 129</ref>

==Demography==
[[File:Songkok Recca.jpg|thumb|Traditional [[Bugis]]-headgear (Songkok Recca) in Tawau. The Bugis in Sabah predominantly concentrated in the eastern corridor of the state, with its main population center located in Tawau<ref name="Asmiati Amat"/>]]
The demographic landscape of Tawau, as highlighted in the Malaysian Census 2010 Report, portrays a rich tapestry of cultures and ethnicities. Initially boasting a population of 397,673, with a subsequent adjustment excluding 57,466 individuals in the [[Kalabakan District]], the municipality is a bustling port town situated in Malaysian Borneo.<ref>Dept. of Statistics Malaysia (web).</ref><ref name="pop"/><ref name="census" group="note"/> Its proximity to [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]] has significantly influenced its demographic makeup, setting it apart from other areas in Sabah.

The population of Tawau is notably diverse, resembling major urban centers in the eastern coast of [[Kalimantan]], such as [[Tarakan]], [[Samarinda]], and [[Balikpapan]]. The census reveals a melting pot of races and ethnicities, characterised by [[Exogamy|intermarriages]] among various [[ethnic group|groups]] and [[nationalities]].

===Nationality===
Non-Malaysian citizens constitute a majority in the town, numbering at 164,729 individuals. The non-Malaysian populace predominantly hails from Indonesia and the Philippines, originating from [[Sulawesi]], [[Kalimantan]], the [[Sulu Archipelago]], [[Mindanao]], and the [[Visayas]]. Additionally, a small Pakistani community, primarily engaged in business ventures, contributes to the multicultural fabric of Tawau. Many non-citizen residents work and reside in plantations, with some having obtained Malaysian citizenship through [[naturalisation]]. However, a significant portion continues to live without proper documentation, residing in [[Informal housing|illegal settlements]] within the town.<ref name="Sadiq2008">{{cite book|author=Kamal Sadiq|title=Paper Citizens: How Illegal Immigrants Acquire Citizenship in Developing Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDa6LrF1yCIC&pg=PA48|date=2 December 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-970780-5|pages=48–}}</ref><ref name="HorstmannWadley2006"/>

===Ethnicities===
Among Malaysian citizens, Bumiputras represent a significant portion, including [[Bugis]], [[Sama-Bajau|Bajau]], [[Banjar people|Banjar]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Tausūg people|Suluk]], [[Tidung people|Tidung]], Bulungan, alongside smaller communities of [[Kadazan-Dusun]], [[Murut people|Murut]], [[Lun Bawang]]/Lundayeh, [[Bruneian Malays]], [[Cocos Malays]], [[Peninsular Malaysia|Peninsula Malays]], [[Kedayan]], [[Iban people|Iban]] and other smaller Bumiputera groups. The Bugis community formed as the largest ethnolinguistic group in Tawau.<ref name="Asmiati Amat">{{cite book|editor=Asmiati Amat|title=Bugis Sabah|url=https://www.itbm.com.my/buku/siri-etnik-sabah-itbm-ums-bugis-sabah|date=2013|publisher=ITBM|isbn=9789830688589|pages=37–38}}</ref>

In Tawau, the [[Malaysian Chinese]] community shares a historical narrative akin to their counterparts in other regions of Sabah. These are predominantly [[Hakka people|Hakkas]], and their migration traces back to the British colonial era. Settling originally in agricultural zones around Apas Road, they have since become a prominent fixture in the town's fabric. Notably, intermarriages between Chinese and Kadazan-Dusun Muruts have fostered a distinctive [[Sino-Native]] community. Additionally, marriages between Chinese individuals and [[Toraja people|Toraja]]ns from Indonesia, as well as Filipinos, are prevalent. Beyond the Sabahan Chinese, Tawau also attracts Chinese immigrants from Peninsula Malaysia, Sarawak, [[Chinese Indonesians|Indonesia]] and the [[Chinese Filipino|Philippines]] into its fold, contributing to its vibrant multicultural landscape.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/arch_0044-8613_1999_num_58_3_3538|title=Chinese Migration to Sabah Before the Second World War|author=Danny Wong Tze-Ken|journal=Archipel|year=1999|volume=58|issue=3|pages=143|doi=10.3406/arch.1999.3538|access-date=9 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Handbook of the State of British North Borneo: With a Supplement of Statistical and Other Useful Information|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1JweAAAAMAAJ|year=1934|publisher=British North Borneo (Chartered) Company}}</ref>

===Religion===
Religiously, most Bumiputera populations in Tawau are [[Islam in Malaysia|Muslims]], with exceptions among the Kadazan-Dusuns, Lundayeh, and Muruts who mainly practice Christianity. Malaysian Chinese are predominantly Buddhists, with some practicing Taoism or Christianity. Other religious groups, including Hindus, Sikhs, Animists, and secularists, also coexist within the town.

The majority of non-citizen inhabitants in Tawau adhere to Islam, with a significant minority belonging to the Christian faith. Among the Christian community, a sizable proportion originates from Indonesia, mainly comprising ethnic [[Torajan people|Toraja]], [[Flores|Florenese]], [[Timor|Timorese]], Chinese Indonesians, [[Dayak people|Dayaks]] Indonesian, and Filipinos of Visayan and Zamboangueño descent.<ref name="HorstmannWadley2006">{{cite book|author1=Alexander Horstmann|author2=Reed L.

===Languages===
The residents of Tawau primarily communicate in [[Malay language|Malay]], often with a distinct [[Malay-based creole languages#Sabah Malay|Sabahan]] [[Creole language|creole]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Stephen Adolphe Wurm|author2=Peter Mühlhäusler|author3=Darrell T. Tyron|title=Atlas of Languages of Intercultural Communication in the Pacific, Asia, and the Americas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=glU0vte5gSkC&pg=PA1615|year=1996|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-013417-9|pages=1615–}}</ref><ref name="Sadiq2008"/> The Tawau version of Sabahan creole shares many similarities with the East Coast Sabahan Dialect and [[Indonesian language|Bahasa Indonesia]] spoken in North Kalimantan across the border. Among the younger generation, there's a noticeable [[language shift]] towards speaking Sabahan Malay over their ancestral language.

The [[Buginese language|Bugis language]] is also prevalent in Tawau due to a considerable population with Bugis ancestry. The main Bugis dialect spoken in the town is Bone, followed closely by Enrekang-Duri and other Bugis dialects.

Given that a significant portion of Tawau's Chinese population is Hakka Chinese, [[Hakka Chinese]] is commonly spoken. Additionally, Tawau Chinese also utilize other Chinese dialects such as [[Cantonese]], [[Hokkien]], [[Teochew Min|Teochew]], [[Hainanese|Hainan]] and other minority dialects.

The language of the east coast Bajau community bears resemblance to the [[Sama–Bajaw languages|Sama language]] in the Philippines and Kalimantan, with borrowed words from the [[Tausug language|Suluk language]]. Notably, the Bajau language on the east coast differs from the west coast Bajau, which has been influenced by [[Malayic languages]] from [[Brunei Malay]].<ref>{{Cite thesis |last=Miller |first=Mark Turner |title=A Grammar of West Coast Bajau |date=2007 |degree=Ph.D. |publisher=University of Texas at Arlington |hdl=10106/577 |hdl-access=free |pages=5–}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Julie K.

===Air===
[[Tawau Airport]] (TA) (ICAO Code: WBKW) is the second largest airport in the state of Sabah, Malaysia, following Kota Kinabalu International Airport. It connects the town to various [[domestic airport|domestic]] destinations, including [[Senai International Airport|Johor Bahru]], [[Kota Kinabalu International Airport|Kota Kinabalu]], [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport|Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Sandakan Airport|Sandakan]], with flights operated by [[AirAsia]], [[Batik Air Malaysia]], [[Malaysia Airlines]] and [[MASwings|MASWings]]. Before the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the airport also offered international regional flights several times per week, including routes to [[Juwata Airport|Tarakan]], [[Indonesia]], operated by MASWings, and to [[Brunei International Airport|Bandar Seri Begawan]], [[Brunei]], via [[RB Link]]. In 2024, international flights resumed, adding various new overseas destinations, including [[Chengdu Tianfu International Airport|Chengdu–Tianfu]], [[Nanjing Lukou International Airport|Nanjing]], [[Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport|Guangzhou]], and [[Macau International Airport|Macau]] operated by Firefly and Batik Air.

Before 2001, Tawau was served by an older airport located on North Street (Jalan Utara). The airport's first flight took place in September 1953. During the 1960s, it handled small aircraft such as the [[Fokker F27 Friendship|Fokker 27]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiaairports.com.my/index.php/latest-news2/16|title=Tawau Airport|publisher=Malaysia Airports|access-date=23 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422172813/http://www.malaysiaairports.com.my/index.php/latest-news2/16|archive-date=22 April 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In the 1980s, the runway was widened to accommodate [[Boeing 737]]s. In the early 1970s, the airport began receiving scheduled international flights operated by [[Bouraq Indonesia Airlines]] to Tarakan and Balikpapan, Indonesia. By the mid-1990s, international destinations expanded to include [[Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport|Makassar]] served by [[Merpati Nusantara Airlines]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/bo2/bo7307/bo7307-3.jpg|title=Bouraq Indonesia Airlines |publisher=Timetable Images |date=2011|website=Timetable Images |access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref> 

The old airport experienced a fatal accident in 1995 when [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 2133]], a [[Fokker 50]], crashed due to pilot error during landing, resulting in 34 fatalities. Additionally, a [[Cessna 208 Caravan]] crashed on takeoff in 1995, and a MAS Boeing 737-400 skidded off the runway in 2001, though neither of these incidents caused fatalities. The old airport was closed when the new Tawau Airport opened.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etawau.com/Transportation/Old_Tawau_Airport.htm|title=Old Tawau Airport|publisher=e-tawau|access-date=23 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422172951/http://www.etawau.com/Transportation/Old_Tawau_Airport.htm|archive-date=22 April 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
