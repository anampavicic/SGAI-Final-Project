==Etymology==
Apparently, the city's name is derived from the Russian translation of "Chrysostom", literally "golden-mouthed" in the original Greek, for the eloquent Saint [[John Chrysostom]],<ref>{{cite web|title=St. John Chrysostom|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08452b.htm|website=The Catholic Encyclopedia|publisher=New Advent|access-date=November 19, 2017}}</ref> because the city was founded near a church dedicated to that saint. In other languages the city is sometimes called ''Ызлататыс ''(Izlataltıs)<ref>{{Cite web |date=2016-03-07 |title=Татарский язык изучающим |url=http://www.tugantelem.narod.ru/dialekt/yusupov.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307100111/http://www.tugantelem.narod.ru/dialekt/yusupov.html |archive-date=2016-03-07  |access-date=2022-07-16 }}</ref> or ''Зылатаус''<ref>{{Cite web |title=Яндекс |url=https://yandex.ru/showcaptcha?cc=1&retpath=aHR0cHM6Ly95YW5kZXgucnUvc2VhcmNoP2NsaWQ9MjM1MzgzNSZ0ZXh0PSVEMCVCNyVEMSU4QiVEMCVCQiVEMCVCMCVEMSU4MiVEMCVCMCVEMSU4MyVEMSU4MSZscj00MyZub3JlYXNrPTE%2C_556260721cf8555b569e7b72ce00d6a8&t=2/1658000038/f0bdb297bd2b33dd4591acf4727122c7&u=d3a4de0-bad12d4b-d5bcc056-c2dadef6&s=188b247f720f57885e9aa3c993ab2e1b |access-date=2022-07-16 |website=yandex.ru}}</ref> (Zılataus) in [[Tatar language|Tatar]] and ''Залатауыс''<ref>{{Cite web |title=Book Viewer |url=http://ebook.bashnl.ru/reader/bookView.html?params=UmVzb3VyY2UtMTEwNQ/0JMu0JTQsNCy0LvQtdGC0YjQuNC9&q=1928 |access-date=2022-07-16 |website=ebook.bashnl.ru}}</ref> in [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]].

Zlatoust was founded in 1754 due to the construction of the [[ironworks]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/5300/|title=Weapons Cabinet in the Arsenal Museum of the Zlatoust Plant|date=1910|website=www.wdl.org|language=en|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> In 1774–76, the workers of the plant took part in the [[insurrection]] led by [[Yemelyan Pugachev]]. In the early 19th century, Pavel Anosov made the first Russian [[bulat steel]] blades in Zlatoust. It was granted town status in 1865. From 1865 to 1919 Zlatoust was part of [[Ufa Governorate]]. The town is also known for the first [[cannon]]s made of Russian [[steel]]. In 1903, the Tsarist authorities brutally suppressed a [[strike action|strike]], organized by the workers of Zlatoust.

In 1815, an arms factory was built here, which began to produce [[sabre]]s and [[sword]]s.<ref name="HISTORY">{{Cite web|url=https://pegasus-leaders.com/history/|title=HISTORY|website=Pegasus Leaders|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> To establish production, more than a hundred experts were invited from renowned arms centers in Europe, including [[Solingen]] and [[Klingenthal]] ([[Germany]]).  In summer 1816, the first batch of Zlatoust blades was sent to [[Saint Petersburg|Saint-Petersburg]], both combat weapons and decorated samples.<ref name="HISTORY"/> Famous artists Ivan Bushuyev and Ivan Boyarshinov authored unique patterns of cold-steel decorated with [[engraving]]s. Bushuyev's and Boyarshinov's swords are very rare; under 2 dozen are believed to exist today, all in Russian state museums and wealthy Russians' collections ([https://www.antique-swords.com/ae59-ivan-boyarshinov-zlatoust-russian-m1827-officers.html rare published example]). The flying winged horse was a favorite element of many of Bushuyev's engravings, so he was given a nickname Ivan the Wingy (Ivanko Krylatko). Since then, a [[pegasus]] has been an emblem of the town. In the 1840s the engraving was shifted onto decorative metal plates. This idea was suggested by Zlatoust factory's director - [[Pavel Petrovich Anosov]], who was taking care of factory's profit and decided to expand the product range. Since then Zlatoust engraving on household items and tableware became popular.<ref>{{usurped|1=[https://web.archive.org/web/20201127144236/https://bestwonderstore.com/2020/11/11/zlatoust-engraving-on-knives-watches-and-tableware/ Zlatoust engraving on knives, watches and tableware.]}}</ref> The [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] gained control over Zlatoust in March 1918. The town was occupied by the [[White movement|Whites]] between June 1918 and July 1919. On 13 July 1919, Zlatoust was seized by the [[Red Army]].

During the Soviet period, Zlatoust became an industrial city, which specialized in [[metallurgy]], [[mechanical engineering]], tool-making, food production, and other industries. Zlatoust is one of the centers of artistic [[engraving]] on metal in Russia. Traditionally, such engravings were done on weapons, such as [[knife|knives]], swords and tableware. Zlatoust engraving on metal received an impulse to a new development, when in the 1960s young graduates of art Zlatoust schools started to work at the factory and reveal their talents.
