'''Montana''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Montana.ogg|m|ɒ|n|ˈ|t|æ|n|ə}} {{respell|mon|TAN|ə}})<ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Montana|access-date=2024-03-08}}</ref> is a landlocked [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Mountain states|Mountain West]] subregion of the [[Western United States|Western]] [[United States]]. It borders [[Idaho]] to the west, [[North Dakota]] to the east, [[South Dakota]] to the southeast, [[Wyoming]] to the south, and the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] of [[Alberta]], [[British Columbia]], and [[Saskatchewan]] to the north. It is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|fourth-largest state by area]], but the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|eighth-least populous state]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population density|third-least densely populated state]]. Its [[List of capitals in the United States|capital]] is [[Helena, Montana|Helena]], while the [[List of municipalities in Montana|most populous city]] is [[Billings, Montana|Billings]]. The western half of the state contains numerous mountain ranges, while the eastern half is characterized by western [[prairie]] terrain and [[badlands]], with smaller mountain ranges found throughout the state.

Most of Montana first came under American [[sovereignty]] with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] from France in 1803 and was explored by the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] shortly thereafter.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=Gold Gives Birth to Western Montana |url=https://www.umt.edu/this-is-montana/columns/stories/gold-western-montana.php |first1=Rick |last1=Graetz |first2=Susie |last2=Graetz |access-date=2024-01-05 |website=This is Montana |publisher=University of Montana |language=en |archive-date=January 5, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240105224839/https://www.umt.edu/this-is-montana/columns/stories/gold-western-montana.php |url-status=live }}</ref> Fur trappers followed and were the main economic activity in the area until gold was discovered in 1852.

Mining, particularly around [[Butte, Montana|Butte]] and [[Helena, Montana|Helena]], would remain the state's main economic engine through the mid-20th century.

Montana has no official [[List of U.S. state and territory nicknames|nickname]] but several unofficial ones, most notably "Big Sky Country", "The Treasure State", "Land of the Shining Mountains", and "[[The Last Best Place]]".{{sfn|Robbins, J.|2008}} Its economy is primarily based on [[agriculture]], including [[ranch]]ing and [[cereal grain]] farming. Other significant economic resources include [[oil]], [[gas]], [[coal]], [[mining]], and [[lumber]]. The health care, service, defense, and government sectors are also significant to the state's economy. Montana's fastest-growing sector is tourism, with 12.6 million tourists (as of 2019) visiting the state each year.<ref>{{Cite web |date=August 18, 2020 |title=UM Travel Institute: 2020 Tests Montana Tourism |url=https://www.umt.edu/news/2020/08/081820itrr.php |access-date=October 25, 2022 |website=[[University of Montana]] |archive-date=October 25, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221025180240/https://www.umt.edu/news/2020/08/081820itrr.php |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name Montana comes from the Spanish word {{Lang|es|montaña}}, which in turn comes from the Latin word {{Lang|la|montanea}}, meaning "mountain" or more broadly "mountainous country".<ref name="Society1910">{{cite book|author=Montana Historical Society|title=Contributions to the Historical Society of Montana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yS9EAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA47|year=1910|publisher=Rocky Mountain Publishing Company|page=47}}</ref>{{sfn|Malone|Roeder|Lang|1991|pp=95–96}} {{Lang|es|Montaña del Norte}} ('Northern Mountain') was the name given by early Spanish explorers to the entire mountainous region of the west.{{sfn|Malone|Roeder|Lang|1991|pp=95–96}} The name Montana was added in 1863 to a bill by the [[United States House Committee on Territories]] (chaired at the time by [[James Mitchell Ashley|James Ashley]] of [[Ohio]]) for the territory that would become [[Idaho Territory]].{{sfn|Sanders|1910|pp=15–60}}

The name was changed by representatives [[Henry Wilson]] (Massachusetts) and [[Benjamin F. Harding]] (Oregon), who complained that Montana had "no meaning".{{sfn|Sanders|1910|pp=15–60}} When Ashley presented a bill to establish a temporary government in 1864 for a new territory to be carved out of Idaho, he again chose [[Montana Territory]].{{sfn|Library of Congress|1864}} This time, representative [[Samuel S. Cox|Samuel Cox]], also of Ohio, objected to the name.{{sfn|Library of Congress|1864}} Cox complained that the name was a [[misnomer]] given that most of the territory was not mountainous, and thought a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] name would be more appropriate than a Spanish one.{{sfn|Library of Congress|1864}} Other names, such as [[Shoshone]], were suggested, but the Committee on Territories decided that they had discretion to choose the name, so the original name of Montana was adopted.{{sfn|Library of Congress|1864}}

==History==
{{Main|History of Montana}}
[[File:Early Indian treaty territories in Montana.png|thumb|[[Early Indian treaty territories in Montana]]]]
[[File:Assinniboine2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]] family, Montana, 1890–91]]For thousands of years, various [[indigenous peoples]] have inhabited the land that is now Montana. Historic tribes encountered by Europeans and settlers from the United States included the [[Crow people|Crow]] in the south-central area, the [[Cheyenne]] and [[Lakota people|Lakota]] in the southeast, the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfeet]], [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]], and [[Gros Ventres]] in the central and north-central area, and the [[Ktunaxa|Kootenai]] and [[Bitterroot Salish|Salish]] the ([https://www.thesalishinstitute.com/our-culture/salish-kalispel-pend-doreille-history Séliš or “Flathead”]) in the west. The ([https://kalispeltribe.com/ Ql̓ispé]  or [[Pend d'Oreilles]]) and [[Kalispel Indian Community of the Kalispel Reservation|Kalispel]] tribes lived near [[Flathead Lake]] and the western mountains, respectively. A part of southeastern Montana was used as a corridor between the Crows and the related [[Hidatsa]]s in North Dakota.{{sfn|Wood|Thiessen|1987|pp=156-220}}

As part of the [[Missouri River]] watershed, all of the land in Montana east of the [[Continental Divide]] was part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, except for a tiny portion in the northeast that is part of the [[Hudson Bay drainage basin|Hudson Bay drainage]]. Subsequent to and particularly in the decades following the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], European, Canadian and American traders operated a [[Fur trade in Montana|fur trade]], trading with indigenous peoples in both western and eastern portions of the area. Though the increased interaction between fur traders and indigenous peoples frequently proved to be a profitable partnership, conflicts broke out when indigenous interests were threatened, such as the conflict between American trappers and the [[Blackfeet Nation|Blackfeet]]. Indigenous peoples in the region were also decimated by diseases introduced by fur traders to which they had no immunity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Binnema|first1=Ted|last2=Dobak|first2=William A.|title="Like the greedy wolf" : the Blackfeet, the St. Louis fur trade, and war fever, 1807–1831|journal=Journal of the Early Republic|date=Fall 2009|volume=29|issue=3|pages=411–440|doi=10.1353/jer.0.0089|jstor=40541856|s2cid=143630848|issn=0275-1275}}</ref>{{sfn|Holmes|2009|loc=[https://web.archive.org/web/20240117154332/https://mhs.mt.gov/education/Textbook/Chapter5/chapter5.pdf Ch. 5] |pp=92-93}} The trading post [[Fort Raymond]] (1807–1811) was constructed in Crow Indian country in 1807.{{sfn|Hoxie1995|p=54}} Until the [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846, land west of the continental divide was disputed between the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British]] and [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. governments]] and was known as the [[Oregon Country]]. The first permanent settlement by Euro-Americans in what today is Montana was [[St. Mary's Mission (Montana)|St. Mary's]], established in 1841 near present-day [[Stevensville, Montana|Stevensville]].{{sfn|Montana Catholic|2010}} In 1847, [[Fort Benton, Montana|Fort Benton]] was built as the uppermost fur-trading post on the Missouri River.{{sfn|National Historic Landmark Program|2013}} In the 1850s, settlers began moving into the [[Beaverhead River|Beaverhead]] and [[Big Hole River|Big Hole]] valleys from the [[Oregon Trail]] and into the Clark's Fork valley.{{sfn|Kittredge|Krauzer|1986|pp=14–23}}

The first gold discovered in Montana was at [[Gold Creek, Montana|Gold Creek]] near present-day [[Garrison, Montana|Garrison]] in 1852. The Gold rush in the region commenced in earnest starting in 1862. A series of major mineral discoveries in the western part of the state found gold, silver, copper, lead, and coal (and later oil) which attracted tens of thousands of miners to the area. The richest of all gold placer diggings was discovered at Alder Gulch, where the town of [[Virginia City, Montana|Virginia City]] was established. Other rich placer deposits were found at Last Chance Gulch, where the city of Helena now stands, [[Confederate Gulch and Diamond City|Confederate Gulch]], Silver Bow, Emigrant Gulch, and [[Cooke City, Montana|Cooke City]]. Gold output between 1862 and 1876 reached $144&nbsp;million, after which silver became even more important. The largest mining operations were at Butte, with important silver deposits and expansive copper deposits.

===Montana territory===

Before the creation of Montana Territory (1864–1889), areas within present-day Montana were part of the [[Oregon Territory]] (1848–1859), [[Washington Territory]] (1853–1863), Idaho Territory (1863–1864), and [[Dakota Territory]] (1861–1864). Montana Territory became a [[territories of the United States|territory of the United States]] on May{{Nbsp}}26, 1864. The first territorial capital was located at [[Bannack, Montana|Bannack]]. [[Sidney Edgerton]] served as the first territorial governor. The capital moved to Virginia City in 1865 and to [[Helena, Montana|Helena]] in 1875. In 1870, the non-Indian population of the Montana Territory was 20,595.{{sfn|Malone|Roeder|Lang|1976|pp=92–113}} The [[Montana Historical Society]], founded on February{{Nbsp}}2, 1865, in Virginia City, is the oldest such institution west of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] (excluding Louisiana).{{sfn|Montana's Museum|2007}} In 1869 and 1870 respectively, the [[Cook–Folsom–Peterson Expedition|Cook–Folsom–Peterson]] and the [[Washburn–Langford–Doane Expedition]]s were launched from Helena into the Upper Yellowstone region. The extraordinary discoveries and reports from these expeditions led to the creation of [[Yellowstone National Park]] in 1872.

===Conflicts===
{{see also|List of military installations in Montana}}

As settlers began populating Montana from the 1850s through the 1870s, disputes with Native Americans ensued, primarily over land ownership and control. In 1855, Washington Territorial Governor [[Isaac Stevens]] negotiated the [[Hellgate Treaty]] between the United States government and the Salish, Pend d'Oreille, and Kootenai people of western Montana, which established boundaries for the tribal nations. The treaty was ratified in 1859.{{sfn|Hellgate Treaty|1855}} While the treaty established what later became the [[Flathead Indian Reservation]], trouble with interpreters and confusion over the terms of the treaty led Whites to believe the [[Bitterroot Valley]] was opened to settlement, but the tribal nations disputed those provisions.{{sfn|Montana Office of Public Instruction|2010}} The Salish remained in the Bitterroot Valley until 1891.{{sfn|Holmes|2009|loc=[https://web.archive.org/web/20240117154347/https://mhs.mt.gov/education/Textbook/Chapter7/chapter7.pdf Ch. 7] |pp=123–146}}

The first U.S. Army post established in Montana was [[Camp Cooke (Montana)|Camp Cooke]] in 1866, on the Missouri River, to protect steamboat traffic to Fort Benton. More than a dozen additional military outposts were established in the state. Pressure over land ownership and control increased due to discoveries of gold in various parts of Montana and surrounding states. Major battles occurred in Montana during [[Red Cloud's War]], the [[Great Sioux War of 1876]], and the [[Nez Perce War]] and in conflicts with [[Piegan Blackfeet]].<!--these may need further breakout later--> The most notable were the [[Marias Massacre]] (1870), [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]] (1876), [[Battle of the Big Hole]] (1877), and [[Battle of Bear Paw]] (1877). The last recorded conflict in Montana between the U.S. Army and Native Americans occurred in 1887 during the [[Crow War#Battle of Crow Agency|Battle of Crow Agency]] in the Big Horn country. Native survivors who had signed treaties were generally required to move onto [[Indian reservation|reservations]].{{sfn|Malone|Roeder|Lang|1976|pp=114–144}}
[[File:Chief Joseph and Col. John Gibbon.jpg|thumb|Chief Joseph and Col. John Gibbon met again on the Big Hole Battlefield site in 1889.]]

Simultaneously with these conflicts, [[American bison|bison]], a [[keystone species]] and the primary protein source that Native people had survived on for many centuries, were being destroyed. Experts estimate that around 13&nbsp;million bison roamed Montana in 1870.{{sfn|Malone|Roeder|Lang|1976|pp=145–171}} In 1875, General [[Philip Sheridan]] pleaded to a joint session of [[United States Congress|Congress]] to authorize the slaughtering of bison herds to deprive Native people of their source of food.{{sfn|Bergman|2004}} By 1884, commercial hunting had brought bison to the verge of extinction; only about 325 bison remained in the entire United States.{{sfn|Fish and Wildlife Service—Bison|2013}}

===Cattle ranching===
Cattle ranching has been central to Montana's history and economy since [[Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site|Johnny Grant]] began wintering cattle in the Deer Lodge Valley in the 1850s and traded cattle fattened in fertile Montana valleys with emigrants on the Oregon Trail.{{sfn|National Park Service-Grant-Kohrs|2013}} [[Nelson Story]] brought the first [[Texas longhorn (cattle)|Texas Longhorn cattle]] into the territory in 1866.{{sfn|Schontzler|2011}}{{sfn|Ultimate Montana|2010}} [[Granville Stuart]], [[Samuel Hauser]], and Andrew J. Davis started a major [[open range|open-range]] cattle operation in Fergus County in 1879.{{sfn|Montana Historical Society|2013}}{{sfn|Milner II|O'Connor|2009|pp=161–184}} The [[Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site]] in [[Deer Lodge, Montana|Deer Lodge]] is maintained today as a link to the ranching style of the late 19th century. Operated by the [[National Park Service]], it is a {{convert|1900|acre|km2|adj=on}} working ranch.{{sfn|Grant-Kohrs Ranch|2013}}

===Railroads===
[[File:Buffalo soldiers1.jpg|thumb|[[Buffalo Soldier]]s, Ft. Keogh, Montana, 1890. The nickname was given to the "Black Cavalry" by the Native American tribes they fought.]]

Tracks of the [[Northern Pacific Railroad]] (NPR) reached Montana from the west in 1882 and from the east in 1883. However, the railroad played a major role in sparking tensions with Native American tribes in the 1870s. [[Jay Cooke]], the NPR president, launched major surveys into the Yellowstone valley in 1871, 1872, and 1873, which were challenged forcefully by the [[Sioux]] under chief [[Sitting Bull]]. These clashes, in part, contributed to the [[Panic of 1873]], a financial crisis that delayed the construction of the railroad into Montana.{{sfn|Lubetkin|2006|pp=xv–xviii}} Surveys in 1874, 1875, and 1876 helped spark the [[Great Sioux War of 1876]]. The transcontinental NPR was completed on September 8, 1883, at [[Gold Creek, Montana|Gold Creek]].

In 1881, the [[Utah and Northern Railway]], a branch line of the [[Union Pacific]], completed a [[narrow-gauge]] line from northern [[Utah]] to Butte.{{sfn|Union Pacific Railroad|2013}} A number of smaller spur lines operated in Montana from 1881 into the 20th century, including the [[Oregon Short Line Railroad|Oregon Short Line]], [[Montana Railroad]], and [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]].

Tracks of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railroad]] (GNR) reached eastern Montana in 1887 and when they reached the northern Rocky Mountains in 1890, the GNR became a significant promoter of tourism to Glacier National Park region. The transcontinental GNR was completed on January 6, 1893, at [[Scenic, Washington]]{{sfn|Great Northern Railway|2013}} and is known as the [[Hi Line Subdivision|Hi Line]], being the northernmost transcontinental rail line in the United States.

Under Territorial Governor [[Thomas Francis Meagher|Thomas Meagher]], Montanans held a constitutional convention in 1866 in a failed bid for statehood. A second [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] held in Helena in 1884 produced a constitution ratified 3:1 by Montana citizens in November 1884. For political reasons, Congress did not approve Montana statehood until February 1889 and President [[Grover Cleveland]] signed an [[omnibus bill]] granting statehood to Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Washington once the appropriate state constitutions were crafted. In July 1889, Montanans convened their third constitutional convention and produced a constitution accepted by the people and the federal government. On November 8, 1889, President [[Benjamin Harrison]] proclaimed Montana the union's 41st state. The first state governor was [[Joseph Toole|Joseph K. Toole]].{{sfn|Malone|Roeder|Lang|1976|pp=172–200}} In the 1880s, Helena (the state capital) had more millionaires per capita than any other United States city.{{sfn|Fanselow|2007|pp=170–171}}

===Homesteading===
The [[Homestead Acts#Homestead Act of 1862|Homestead Act of 1862]] provided free land to settlers who could claim and "prove-up" {{convert|160|acre|km2}} of federal land in the Midwest and western United States. Montana did not see a large influx of immigrants from this act because 160 acres were usually insufficient to support a family in the arid territory.{{sfn|Holmes|2009|loc=[https://web.archive.org/web/20240117154307/https://mhs.mt.gov/education/Textbook/Chapter13/chapter13.pdf Ch.13] |p=253}} The first homestead claim under the act in Montana was made by David Carpenter near Helena in 1868. The first claim by a woman was made near Warm Springs Creek by Gwenllian Evans, the daughter of Deer Lodge Montana pioneer, Morgan Evans.{{sfn|Lux|1964|pp=333–348}} By 1880, farms were in the more verdant valleys of central and western Montana, but few were on the eastern plains.{{sfn|Holmes|2009|loc=[https://web.archive.org/web/20240117154307/https://mhs.mt.gov/education/Textbook/Chapter13/chapter13.pdf Ch. 13] |p=253}}

The [[Desert Land Act|Desert Land Act of 1877]] was passed to allow settlement of arid lands in the west and allotted {{convert|640|acre|km2}} to settlers for a fee of $.25 per acre and a promise to irrigate the land. After three years, a fee of one dollar per acre would be paid and the settler would own the land. This act brought mostly cattle and sheep ranchers into Montana, many of whom grazed their herds on the Montana prairie for three years, did little to irrigate the land and then abandoned it without paying the final fees.{{sfn|Lux|1964|pp=333–348}} Some farmers came with the arrival of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railroads throughout the 1880s and 1890s, though in relatively small numbers.{{sfn|Toole1|1959|p=228}}

In the early 1900s, [[James J. Hill]] of the Great Northern began to promote settlement in the Montana prairie to fill his trains with settlers and goods. Other railroads followed suit.{{sfn|Toole1|1959|pp=223–224}} In 1902, the [[Reclamation Act]] was passed, allowing irrigation projects to be built in Montana's eastern river valleys. In 1909, Congress passed the [[Enlarged Homestead Act]] that expanded the amount of free land from {{convert|160|to|320|acre|km2|1}} per family and in 1912 reduced the time to "prove up" on a claim to three years.{{sfn|Holmes|2009|loc=[https://web.archive.org/web/20240117154307/https://mhs.mt.gov/education/Textbook/Chapter13/chapter13.pdf Ch. 13] |p=254}} In 1916, the [[Stock-Raising Homestead Act]] allowed homesteads of 640 acres in areas unsuitable for irrigation.{{sfn|Holmes|2009|loc=[https://web.archive.org/web/20240117154307/https://mhs.mt.gov/education/Textbook/Chapter13/chapter13.pdf Ch. 13] |p=255}} This combination of advertising and changes in the Homestead Act drew tens of thousands of homesteaders, lured by free land, with World War I bringing particularly high wheat prices. In addition, Montana was going through a temporary period of higher-than-average precipitation.{{sfn|Holmes|2009|loc=[https://web.archive.org/web/20240117154307/https://mhs.mt.gov/education/Textbook/Chapter13/chapter13.pdf Ch. 13] |pp=256–258}} Homesteaders arriving in this period were known as "honyockers", or "scissorbills".{{sfn|Toole1|1959|p=228}} The word ''honyocker'' possibly derived from the ethnic slur ''hunyak{{sfn|Howard|1959|p=181}}'' and was applied in a derisive manner at homesteaders, who were perceived as being "greenhorns", "new at his business", or "unprepared".{{sfn|Stuart|1913|pp=133–137}} However, most of these new settlers had farming experience, though many did not.{{sfn|Toole1|1959|p=229}}

{{blockquote|Honyocker, scissorbill, nester ...

However, farmers faced a number of problems.

By 1910, homesteaders filed claims on over five million acres, and by 1923, over 93&nbsp;million acres were farmed.{{sfn|Toole1|1959|p=230}} In 1910, the Great Falls land office alone had more than a thousand homestead filings per month,{{sfn|Holmes|2009|loc=[https://web.archive.org/web/20240117154307/https://mhs.mt.gov/education/Textbook/Chapter13/chapter13.pdf Ch. 13] |p=259}} and at the peak of 1917–1918 it had 14,000 new homesteads each year.{{sfn|Holmes|2009|loc=[https://web.archive.org/web/20240117154307/https://mhs.mt.gov/education/Textbook/Chapter13/chapter13.pdf Ch. 13] |p=261}} Significant drops occurred following the drought in 1919.{{sfn|Libecap|Hansen|2002|pp=86–120}}

===Montana and World War I===
As [[World War I]] broke out, [[Jeannette Rankin]], representative of Montana and the first woman in the United States to be a member of Congress, voted against the United States' declaration of war. Her actions were widely criticized in Montana, where support for the war and [[patriotism]] was strong.{{sfn|Montana Historical Society—WWI|2013}} In 1917–1918, due to a miscalculation of Montana's population, about 40,000 Montanans, 10% of the state's population,{{sfn|Montana Historical Society—WWI|2013}} volunteered or were [[Conscription|drafted]] into the armed forces. This represented a manpower contribution to the war that was 25% higher than any other state on a [[per capita]] basis. Around 1,500 Montanans died as a result of the war<!--this number includes KIA and later deaths in and out of the war zone, verified here: http://montanahistorywiki.pbworks.com/w/page/21639730/Montana%20War%20Casualties#WorldWarI19171918--> and 2,437 were wounded, also higher than any other state on a per capita basis.{{sfn|Howard|1959|pp=202–203}} Montana's [[United States Army Remount Service|Remount station]] in [[Miles City, Montana|Miles City]] provided 10,000 [[Horses in World War I|cavalry horses]] for the war, more than any other Army post in the country. The war created a boom for Montana mining, lumber, and farming interests, as demand for war materials and food increased.{{sfn|Montana Historical Society—WWI|2013}}

In June 1917, the U.S. Congress passed the [[Espionage Act of 1917]], which was extended by the [[Sedition Act of 1918]].{{sfn|History Channel|2013}} In February 1918, the Montana legislature had passed the Montana Sedition Act, which was a model for the federal version.{{sfn|University of Montana|2005}} In combination, these laws criminalized criticism of the U.S. government, military, or symbols through speech or other means. The Montana Act led to the arrest of more than 200 individuals and the conviction of 78, mostly of German or Austrian descent. More than 40 spent time in prison.<!--sources vary: 42 to 47--> In May 2006, then-Governor [[Brian Schweitzer]] posthumously issued full pardons for all those convicted of violating the Montana Sedition Act.{{sfn|Montana Sedition Project|2013}}

The Montanans who opposed U.S. entry into the war included immigrant groups of German and Irish heritage, as well as pacifist [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] people such as the [[Hutterites]] and [[Mennonites]], many of whom were also of Germanic heritage. In turn, pro-War groups formed, such as the Montana Council of Defense, created by Governor [[Samuel V. Stewart]] and local "loyalty committees".{{sfn|Montana Historical Society—WWI|2013}}

War sentiment was complicated by labor issues. The [[Anaconda Copper Company]], which was at its historic peak of copper production,{{sfn|Butte-Anaconda Historic District|2006|p=18}} was an extremely powerful force in Montana, but it also faced criticism and opposition from [[Socialism|socialist]] newspapers and unions struggling to make gains for their members.{{sfn|Murphy|1980}} In Butte, a multiethnic community with a significant European immigrant population, labor unions, particularly the newly formed Metal Mine Workers' Union, opposed the war on grounds it mostly profited large lumber and mining interests.{{sfn|Montana Historical Society—WWI|2013}} In the wake of ramped-up mine production and the [[Speculator Mine disaster]] in June 1917,{{sfn|Montana Historical Society—WWI|2013}} [[Industrial Workers of the World]] organizer [[Frank Little (unionist)|Frank Little]] arrived in Butte to organize miners. He gave some speeches with inflammatory antiwar rhetoric. On August 1, 1917, he was dragged from his boarding house by masked [[Vigilantism|vigilantes]], and hanged from a railroad trestle, considered a [[lynching]].{{sfn|New York Times|1917}} Little's murder and the strikes that followed resulted in the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] being sent to Butte to restore order.{{sfn|Montana Historical Society—WWI|2013}} Overall, anti-German and antilabor sentiment increased and created a movement that led to the passage of the Montana Sedition Act the following February.{{sfn|Foner|1987|p=289}}<!--"The immediate effect of the lynching of Frank Little was the spread of the miners' strike. The union claimed it had proof that the Anaconda Copper Company had perpetrated the crime, and the workers' anger enabled the MMWU to close most mines, and because of the lack of ore, major smelters closed all over the state. But on August 10, Federal troops were ordered to Butte to patrol the streets leading to the mines. And as the strike spread, Senator Myers of Montana introduced into the U.S. Senate an anti-sedition bill that could have been used to guarantee the strike's defeat. When this failed to pass, a special session of the Montana legislature passed what have been called "incredible laws curbing the freedom of speech". One such law was the Montana Sedition Act which provided that{{nbsp}}... [text of source]"--><!--keep, useful--> In addition, the Council of Defense was made a state agency with the power to prosecute and punish individuals deemed in violation of the Act. The council also passed rules limiting public gatherings and prohibiting the speaking of German in public.{{sfn|Montana Historical Society—WWI|2013}}

In the wake of the legislative action in 1918, emotions rose. U.S. Attorney [[Burton K. Wheeler]] and several district court judges who hesitated to prosecute or convict people brought up on charges were strongly criticized. Wheeler was brought before the Council of Defense, though he avoided formal proceedings, and a district court judge from [[Forsyth, Montana|Forsyth]] was [[Impeachment in the United States|impeached]]. Burnings of German-language books and several near-hangings occurred. The prohibition on speaking German remained in effect into the early 1920s. Complicating the wartime struggles, the [[Spanish flu|1918 influenza epidemic]] claimed the lives of more than 5,000 Montanans.{{sfn|Montana Historical Society—WWI|2013}} The suppression of [[civil liberties]] that occurred led some historians to dub this period "Montana's Agony".{{sfn|Murphy|1980}}

===Depression era===
An economic depression began in Montana after World War I and lasted through the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] until the beginning of [[World War II]]. This caused great hardship for farmers, ranchers, and miners. {{sfn|Brief History of Montana|2013}}{{sfn|McDean|1986|pp=117–126}}

By the time the U.S. entered World War II on December 8, 1941, many Montanans had enlisted in the military to escape the poor national economy of the previous decade. Another 40,000-plus Montanans entered the armed forces in the first year following the declaration of war, and more than 57,000 joined up before the war ended. These numbers constituted about ten percent of the state's population, and Montana again contributed one of the highest numbers of soldiers per capita of any state. Many Native Americans were among those who served, including soldiers from the Crow Nation who became [[Code Talkers]]. At least 1,500 Montanans died in the war.{{sfn|Montana Historical Society-WWII|2013}} Montana also was the training ground for the [[First Special Service Force]] or "Devil's Brigade", a joint U.S.-Canadian commando-style force that trained at [[Fort William Henry Harrison]] for experience in mountainous and winter conditions before deployment.{{sfn|Montana Historical Society-WWII|2013}}{{sfn|Werner|Welply|2006|pp=5, 10, 66}} Air bases were built in Great Falls, Lewistown, Cut Bank, and [[Glasgow, Montana|Glasgow]], some of which were used as staging areas to prepare planes to be sent to allied forces in the [[Soviet Union]]. During the war, about 30 Japanese [[Fu-Go balloon bomb]]s were documented to have landed in Montana, though no casualties nor major forest fires were attributed to them.{{sfn|Montana Historical Society-WWII|2013}}

In 1940, [[Jeannette Rankin]] was again elected to Congress. In 1941, as she had in 1917, she voted against the United States' declaration of war after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Hers was the only vote against the war, and in the wake of public outcry over her vote, Rankin required police protection for a time. Other pacifists tended to be those from "peace churches" who generally opposed war. Many individuals claiming [[conscientious objector]] status from throughout the U.S. were sent to Montana during the war as [[smokejumper]]s and for other forest fire-fighting duties.{{sfn|Montana Historical Society-WWII|2013}}

In 1942, the U.S. Army established [[Rimini, Montana|Camp Rimini]] near Helena for the purpose of training sled dogs in winter weather.

===Other military===
During World War II, the planned [[battleship]] [[USS Montana|USS ''Montana'']] was named in honor of the state but it was never completed. Montana is the only one of the first 48 states lacking a completed battleship being named for it. [[Alaska]] and Hawaii have both had nuclear submarines named after them. Montana is the only state in the union without a modern naval ship named in its honor. However, in August 2007, Senator [[Jon Tester]] asked that a [[submarine]] be christened USS ''Montana''.{{sfn|Tester|2007}} Secretary of the Navy [[Ray Mabus]] announced on September 3, 2015, that ''Virginia'' Class attack submarine [[USS Montana (SSN-794)|SSN-794]] will become the second commissioned warship to bear the name.<ref>{{Cite web|title = U.S. Navy submarine will be named U.S.S.

===Cold War Montana===
In the post-World War II [[Cold War]] era, Montana became host to [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[Military Air Transport Service]] (1947) for airlift training in [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster|C-54 Skymasters]] and eventually, in 1953 [[Strategic Air Command]] air and missile forces were based at [[Malmstrom Air Force Base]] in Great Falls. The base also hosted the [[29th Training Systems Squadron#Air Defense Command|29th Fighter Interceptor Squadron]], [[Aerospace Defense Command|Air Defense Command]] from 1953 to 1968. In December 1959, Malmstrom AFB was selected as the home of the new [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman I]] [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]. The first operational missiles were in place and ready in early 1962. In late 1962, missiles assigned to the [[341st Missile Wing|341st Strategic Missile Wing]] played a major role in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. When the Soviets removed their missiles from Cuba, President [[John F. Kennedy]] said the Soviets backed down because they knew he had an "ace in the hole", referring directly to the Minuteman missiles in Montana. Montana eventually became home to the largest ICBM field in the U.S. covering {{convert|23500|sqmi|km2}}.{{sfn|Malmstrom|2013}}

Montana is one of the eight [[Mountain States]], located in the north of the region known as the [[Western United States]]. It borders [[North Dakota]] and [[South Dakota]] to the east. [[Wyoming]] is to the south, [[Idaho]] is to the west and southwest, and the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] of [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], and [[Saskatchewan]] are to the north, making it the only state to border three Canadian provinces.

With an area of {{convert|147040|sqmi|km2}},<ref name=census/> Montana is slightly larger than [[Japan]]. It is the fourth-largest state in the United States after [[Alaska]], [[Texas]], and [[California]],{{sfn|Anderson|2012|p=4}} and the largest landlocked state.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Montana {{!}} Capital, Population, Climate, Map, & Facts|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Montana-state|access-date=February 17, 2021|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|archive-date=March 16, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210316111018/https://www.britannica.com/place/Montana-state|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Topography===
[[File:Montana Relief 1.jpg|thumb|left|Relief map of Montana]]

The state's [[topography]] is roughly defined by the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]], which splits much of the state into distinct eastern and western regions.{{sfn|Malone|Roeder|Lang|1991|p=6}} Most of Montana's hundred or more named mountain ranges are in the state's western half, most of which is geologically and geographically part of the northern [[Rocky Mountains]].{{sfn|Malone|Roeder|Lang|1991|p=6}}{{sfn|Madej|Jones|2007}} The [[Absaroka Mountains|Absaroka]] and [[Beartooth Mountains|Beartooth]] ranges in the state's south-central part are technically part of the Central Rocky Mountains.{{sfn|Elias|2002|p=55}} The [[Rocky Mountain Front]] is a significant feature in the state's north-central portion,{{sfn|Graetz|Clemenz|1984|p=59}} and isolated [[island range]]s that interrupt the [[prairie]] landscape common in the central and eastern parts of the state.{{sfn|Aarstad|Arguimbau|Baumler|Porsild|2009|p=58}} About 60 percent of the state is prairie, part of the northern [[Great Plains]].{{sfn|Malone|Roeder|Lang|1991|pp=6–7}}

The [[Bitterroot Mountains]]—one of the longest continuous ranges in the Rocky Mountain chain from Alaska to [[Mexico]]{{sfn|Cooper|2009|p=11}}—along with smaller ranges, including the [[Coeur d'Alene Mountains]] and the [[Cabinet Mountains]], divide the state from Idaho. The southern third of the Bitterroot range blends into the Continental Divide.{{sfn|Cooper|2009|p=45}} Other major mountain ranges west of the divide include the [[Cabinet Mountains]], the [[Anaconda Range]], the [[Mission Range|Missions]], the [[Garnet Range]], the [[Sapphire Mountains]], and the [[Flint Creek Range]].{{sfn|Merrill-Maker|2006|pp=57–63}}

The divide's northern section, where the mountains rapidly give way to prairie, is part of the [[Rocky Mountain Front]].{{sfn|Kudray|Cooper|2006|p=1}} The front is most pronounced in the [[Lewis Range]], located primarily in [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]].{{sfn|Ross|1959|p=10}} Due to the configuration of mountain ranges in Glacier National Park, the [[Northern Divide]] (which begins in Alaska's [[Seward Peninsula]]){{sfn|Enright|2010|p=xxiii}} crosses this region and turns east in Montana at [[Triple Divide Peak (Montana)|Triple Divide Peak]].{{sfn|Temple|2008|p=493}} It causes the [[Waterton River]], [[Belly River|Belly]], and [[St. Mary River (Montana-Alberta)|Saint Mary]] rivers to flow north into [[Alberta]], Canada.{{sfn|Ross|1959|p=8}} There they join the [[Saskatchewan River]], which ultimately empties into [[Hudson Bay]].{{sfn|Canadian Council for Geographic Education|2013}}

East of the divide, several roughly parallel ranges cover the state's southern part, including the [[Gravelly Range]], [[Madison Range]], [[Gallatin Range]], [[Absaroka Mountains]], and [[Beartooth Mountains]].{{sfn|Burger|2004|pp=10–11}} The Beartooth Plateau is the largest continuous land mass over {{convert|10000|ft|m}} high in the continental United States.{{sfn|Cunningham|1990|p=77}} It contains the state's highest point, [[Granite Peak (Montana)|Granite Peak]], {{convert|12799|ft|m}} high.{{sfn|Cunningham|1990|p=77}} North of these ranges are the [[Big Belt Mountains]], [[Bridger Mountains (Montana)|Bridger Mountains]], [[Tobacco Root Mountains|Tobacco Roots]], and several island ranges, including the [[Crazy Mountains]] and [[Little Belt Mountains]].{{sfn|Montana State Library|2013}}

[[File:St Mary Lake.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Saint Mary Lake]] in Glacier National Park]]

Between many mountain ranges are several rich river valleys. The [[Big Hole River|Big Hole]],{{sfn|Florence|Nystrom|Gierlich|2001|pp=506–507}} [[Bitterroot Valley|Bitterroot]],{{sfn|Florence|Nystrom|Gierlich|2001|pp=501–502}} [[Gallatin County, Montana|Gallatin]],{{sfn|Florence|Nystrom|Gierlich|2001|pp=575–577}} [[Flathead Valley|Flathead]],{{sfn|Malone|Roeder|Lang|1991|p=357}}{{sfn|Peterson|2012|p=24}} and [[Paradise Valley (Montana)|Paradise Valleys]]{{sfn|Florence|Nystrom|Gierlich|2001|pp=579–580}} have extensive agricultural resources and multiple opportunities for tourism and recreation.

East and north of this transition zone are the expansive and sparsely populated [[Great Plains|Northern Plains]], with [[Plateaus|tableland]] prairies, smaller island mountain ranges, and [[badlands]].{{sfn|Merrill-Maker|2006|p=50}} The isolated island ranges east of the Divide include the Bear Paw Mountains,{{sfn|Fletcher|Bradshaw|Axline|Shope|2008|p=93}} [[Bull Mountains]],{{sfn|Vasapolli|2003|p=16}} [[Castle Mountains (Montana)|Castle Mountains]],{{sfn|United States Forest Service|2007|p=207}} [[Crazy Mountains]],{{sfn|Merrill-Maker|2006|p=58}} [[Highwood Mountains]],{{sfn|Mining and Scientific Press|1899|p=408}} [[Judith Mountains]],{{sfn|Mining and Scientific Press|1899|p=408}} [[Little Belt Mountains]],{{sfn|United States Forest Service|2007|p=207}} [[Little Rocky Mountains]],{{sfn|Mining and Scientific Press|1899|p=408}} the [[Pryor Mountains]],{{sfn|Merrill-Maker|2006|p=58}} [[Little Snowy Mountains]], [[Big Snowy Mountains]],{{sfn|Vasapolli|2003|p=16}} [[Sweet Grass Hills]],{{sfn|Vasapolli|2003|p=16}} and—in the state's southeastern corner near [[Ekalaka]]—the [[Long Pines]].{{sfn|Madej|Jones|2007}} Many of these isolated eastern ranges were created about 120 to 66&nbsp;million years ago when [[magma]] welling up from the interior cracked and bowed the earth's surface here.{{sfn|Jewell|McRae|2012|p=439}}

The area east of the divide in the state's north-central portion is known for the [[Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument|Missouri Breaks]] and other significant [[rock formation]]s.{{sfn|Ballard|2008|pp=92–94}} Three [[butte]]s south of [[Great Falls, Montana|Great Falls]] are major landmarks: Cascade, Crown, Square, Shaw, and Buttes.{{sfn|Merrill-Maker|2006|p=49}} Known as [[laccolith]]s, they formed when [[igneous rock]] protruded through cracks in the sedimentary rock.{{sfn|Merrill-Maker|2006|p=49}} The underlying surface consists of [[sandstone]] and [[shale]].{{sfn|Fisher|1908|pp=23–24}} Surface soils in the area are highly diverse, and greatly affected by the local geology, whether glaciated plain, intermountain basin, mountain foothills, or tableland.{{sfn|Soil Conservation Service|1953|p=4}} Foothill regions are often covered in weathered stone or broken [[slate]], or consist of uncovered bare rock (usually igneous, [[quartzite]], sandstone, or shale).{{sfn|Soil Conservation Service|1953|pp=7–8}} The soil of intermountain basins usually consists of [[clay]], [[gravel]], [[sand]], [[silt]], and [[volcanic ash]], much of it laid down by lakes which covered the region during the [[Oligocene]] 33 to 23&nbsp;million years ago.{{sfn|Soil Conservation Service|1953|p=8}} Tablelands are often topped with [[argillite]] gravel and weathered quartzite, occasionally underlain by shale.{{sfn|Soil Conservation Service|1953|pp=10–11}} The glaciated plains are generally covered in clay, gravel, sand, and silt left by the [[proglacial lake|proglacial]] [[Lake Great Falls]] or by [[moraine]]s or gravel-covered former lake basins left by the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] 85,000 to 11,000 years ago.{{sfn|Soil Conservation Service|1953|p=11}} Farther east, areas such as [[Makoshika State Park]] near [[Glendive]] and [[Medicine Rocks State Park]] near Ekalaka contain some of the most scenic [[badlands]] regions in the state.{{sfn|Montana Outdoors|2002}}

The [[Hell Creek Formation]] in Northeast Montana is a major source of [[dinosaur]] [[fossil]]s.{{sfn|Archibald|1997|p=223}} [[Paleontologist]] [[Jack Horner (paleontologist)|Jack Horner]] of the [[Museum of the Rockies]] in [[Bozeman, Montana|Bozeman]] brought this formation to the world's attention with several major finds.{{sfn|Newsmakers-Jack Horner|2013}}

{{See also|List of rivers of Montana|List of lakes in Montana}}

Montana has thousands of named rivers and creeks,{{sfn|Geological Survey—search|2013}} {{convert|450|mi|km}} of which are known for [[Blue Ribbon fishery|"blue-ribbon"]] [[trout]] fishing.{{sfn|Therriault|2010|p=93}}{{sfn|Fischer|Fischer|2008|p=2}} Montana's water resources provide for recreation, [[hydropower]], crop and forage irrigation, mining, and water for human consumption.

Montana is one of few geographic areas in the world whose rivers form parts of three major [[Drainage basin|watersheds]] (i.e. where two [[continental divide]]s intersect). Its rivers feed the Pacific Ocean, the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and [[Hudson Bay]].

[[File:Köppen Climate Types Montana.png|left|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] of Montana, using 1991-2020 [[Climatological normal|climate normals]]]]
Montana is a large state with considerable variation in geography, topography and elevation, and the climate is equally varied. The state spans from below the [[45th parallel north|45th parallel]] (the line equidistant between the equator and [[North Pole]]) to the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], and elevations range from under {{convert|2000|ft|m}} to nearly {{convert|13000|ft|m}} above sea level. The western half is mountainous, interrupted by numerous large valleys. [[Eastern Montana]] comprises plains and badlands, broken by hills and isolated mountain ranges, and has a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]], [[Continentality|continental]] climate ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''[[Cold steppe|BSk]]''). The [[Continental Divide]] has a considerable effect on the climate, as it restricts the flow of warmer air from the Pacific from moving east, and drier continental air from moving west. The area west of the divide has a modified northern Pacific Coast climate, with milder winters, cooler summers, less wind, and a longer growing season.{{sfn|Western Regional Climate Center|2013}} Low clouds and fog often form in the valleys west of the divide in winter, but this is rarely seen in the east.{{sfn|Animal Range and Sciences|2013}}

Average daytime temperatures vary from {{convert|28|°F|°C|1|disp=or}} in January to {{convert|84.5|°F|°C|disp=or}} in July.{{sfn|Montana Office of Tourism—FAQ|2013}}{{verify source|date=June 2014}} The variation in geography leads to great variation in temperature. The highest observed summer temperature was {{convert|117|°F|°C|1|disp=or}} at [[Glendive]] on July 20, 1893, and Medicine Lake on July 5, 1937. Throughout the state, summer nights are generally cool and pleasant. Extreme hot weather is less common above {{convert|4000|ft|m|disp=or|sp=us}}.{{sfn|Western Regional Climate Center|2013}} Snowfall has been recorded in all months of the year in the more mountainous areas of central and western Montana, though it is rare in July and August.{{sfn|Western Regional Climate Center|2013}}

The coldest temperature on record for Montana is also the coldest temperature for the contiguous United States. On January 20, 1954, {{convert|-70|°F|°C|1|disp=or}} was recorded at a gold mining camp near [[Rogers Pass (Montana)#Record cold temperature|Rogers Pass]]. Temperatures vary greatly on cold nights, and [[Helena, Montana|Helena]], {{convert|40|mi|km}} to the southeast had a low of only {{convert|-36|°F|°C|1|disp=or}} on the same date, and an all-time record low of {{convert|-42|F|C|1|disp=or}}.{{sfn|Western Regional Climate Center|2013}} Winter cold spells are usually the result of [[cold front|cold continental air]] coming south from Canada. The front is often well defined, causing a large temperature drop in a 24-hour period. Conversely, air flow from the southwest results in "[[chinook wind|chinooks]]". These steady {{convert|25|–|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} (or more) winds can suddenly warm parts of Montana, especially areas just to the east of the mountains, where temperatures sometimes rise up to {{convert|50|–|60|F|C|1}} for 10 days or longer.{{sfn|Western Regional Climate Center|2013}}{{sfn|Climate Information|2007}}

[[Loma, Montana|Loma]] is the site of the most extreme recorded temperature change in a 24-hour period in the United States. On January 15, 1972, a [[chinook wind]] blew in and the temperature rose from {{convert|-54|to|49|°F|°C|1}}; a 103&nbsp;°F (49.4&nbsp;°C) degree difference.{{sfn|Horvitz|Stephens|Helfert|Goodge|2002}}

[[File:Fall Clark Fork.jpg|thumb|left|Clark Fork River, Missoula, in autumn]]

Average annual precipitation is {{convert|15|in|mm}}, but great variations are seen. The mountain ranges block the moist Pacific air, holding moisture in the western valleys, and creating [[rain shadow]]s to the east. [[Heron, Montana|Heron]], in the west, receives the most [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], {{convert|34.70|in|mm}}. On the eastern (leeward) side of a mountain range, the valleys are much drier; [[Lonepine, Montana|Lonepine]] averages {{convert|11.45|in|mm}}, and [[Deer Lodge, Montana|Deer Lodge]] {{convert|11.00|in|mm}} of precipitation. The mountains can receive over {{convert|100|in|mm}}, <!--sounds like snow, not rain, need to check--> for example the [[Grinnell Glacier]] in [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] gets {{convert|105|in|mm}}.{{sfn|Animal Range and Sciences|2013}} An area southwest of Belfry averaged only {{convert|6.59|in|mm}} over a 16-year period. Most of the larger cities get {{convert|30|to|50|in|m|2|disp=or|sp=us}} of snow each year. Mountain ranges can accumulate {{convert|300|in|m|2|disp=or|sp=us}} of snow during a winter. Heavy [[snowstorm]]s may occur from September through May, though most snow falls from November to March.{{sfn|Western Regional Climate Center|2013}}

The climate has become warmer in Montana, with the average temperature rising almost 2.5&nbsp;°F (1.3&nbsp;°C) since 1900 at a rate higher than the continental U.S. average, and continues to do so.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Frankson |first1=Rebekah |last2=Kunkel |first2=Kenneth E. |last3=Champion |first3=Sarah M. |last4=Easterling |first4=David R. |last5=Jencso |first5=Kelsey |date=2022 |title=State Climate Summaries for the United States 2022.

Montana has a larger Native American population, both numerically and as a percentage, than most U.S. states. Ranked 45th in population (by the 2010 census) it is 19th in native people,{{sfn|Census Bureau-Annual Estimates of Race|2012}} who are 6.5% of the state's population—the sixth-highest percentage of all fifty states.{{sfn|Census Bureau-Annual Estimates of Race|2012}} Of Montana's 56 counties, Native Americans constitute a majority in three: [[Big Horn County, Montana|Big Horn]], [[Glacier County, Montana|Glacier]], and [[Roosevelt County, Montana|Roosevelt]].{{sfn|Rural Policy Research Institute|2006|p=4}} Other counties with large Native American populations include [[Blaine County, Montana|Blaine]], [[Cascade County, Montana|Cascade]], [[Hill County, Montana|Hill]], [[Missoula County, Montana|Missoula]], and [[Yellowstone County, Montana|Yellowstone Counties]].{{sfn|Montana Office of Public Instruction|2009|p=64}} The state's Native American population grew by 27.9% between 1980 and 1990 (at a time when Montana's entire population rose 1.6%),{{sfn|Montana Office of Public Instruction|2009|p=64}} and by 18.5 percent between 2000 and 2010.{{sfn|Norris|Vines|Hoeffel|2012}}

As of 2009, almost two-thirds of Native Americans in the state live in urban areas.{{sfn|Montana Office of Public Instruction|2009|p=64}} Of Montana's 20 largest cities, Polson (15.7%), Havre (13.0%), Great Falls (5.0%), Billings (4.4%), and Anaconda (3.1%) had the greatest percentages of Native American residents in 2010.{{sfn|Redistricting Data Summary|2011}} Billings (4,619), Great Falls (2,942), Missoula (1,838), Havre (1,210), and Polson (706) have the most Native Americans living there.{{sfn|Redistricting Data Summary|2011}} The state's seven reservations include more than 12 distinct Native American [[ethnolinguistic]] groups.{{sfn|Census Bureau|2010a}}

While the largest European American population in Montana is German (which may also include Austrian and Swiss, among other groups), pockets of significant [[Scandinavia]]n ancestry are prevalent in some of the farming-dominated northern and eastern prairie regions, parallel to nearby regions of North Dakota and Minnesota. Farmers of Irish, Scots, and English roots also settled in Montana. The historically mining-oriented communities of western Montana such as Butte have a wider range of European American ethnicity; [[Finns]], [[Eastern Europe]]ans and especially Irish settlers left an indelible mark on the area, as well as people originally from British mining regions such as [[Cornwall]], [[Devon]], and [[Wales]]. The nearby city of Helena, also founded as a mining camp, had a similar mix in addition to a small Chinatown.{{sfn|Census Bureau|2010a}} Many of Montana's historic logging communities originally attracted people of Scottish, Scandinavian, [[Slavs|Slavic]], [[English Americans|English]], and [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]] descent.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The [[Hutterites]], an [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] sect originally from Switzerland, settled in Montana, and today is second only to [[South Dakota]] in U.S. Hutterite population, with several colonies across the state. Beginning in the mid-1990s, the state also had an influx of [[Amish]], who moved to Montana from increasingly urbanized areas of Ohio and Pennsylvania.{{sfn|Tode|2004}}

Montana's [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] population is concentrated in the Billings area in south-central Montana, where many of Montana's Mexican Americans have been in the state for generations. Great Falls has the highest percentage of African Americans in its population, although Billings has more African American residents than Great Falls.{{sfn|Redistricting Data Summary|2011}}

The Chinese in Montana, while a low percentage today, have been a historically important presence. About 2,000–3,000 Chinese miners were in the mining areas of Montana by 1870, and 2,500 in 1890. However, public opinion grew increasingly negative towards them in the 1890s, and nearly half of the state's Asian population left by 1900.{{sfn|Morris|1997|pp=113–124}} Today, the Missoula area has a large [[Hmong Americans|Hmong]] population{{sfn|Montana Arts Council|2013}} and the nearly 3,000 Montanans who claim [[Filipino Americans|Filipino]] ancestry are the largest Asian American group in the state.{{sfn|Census Bureau|2010a}}

In the 2015 United States census estimates, Montana had the second-highest percentage of U.S. military veterans living there. Only the state of [[Alaska]] had a higher percentage, with roughly 14 percent of Alaska's population over 18 being veterans, with Montana having roughly 12 percent of its population over 18 being veterans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2015/comm/percent-veterans.html|title=Percent Veterans By State|website=The United States Census Bureau|access-date=January 17, 2021|archive-date=January 22, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210122015611/https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2015/comm/percent-veterans.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Montana is a relative hub of beer [[microbrewery|microbrewing]], ranking third in the nation in number of craft breweries per capita in 2011.{{sfn|Brewers Association|2013}} Significant industries exist for [[lumber]] and mineral [[mining|extraction]]; the state's resources include gold, coal, silver, [[talc]], and [[vermiculite]]. [[Ecotax]]es on resource extraction are numerous. A 1974 state [[severance tax]] on coal (which varied from 20 to 30%) was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana]]'', 453 U.S. 609 (1981).<ref>{{ussc|453|609|1981}}</ref>

Tourism is also important to the economy, with more than ten million visitors a year to Glacier National Park, Flathead Lake, the Missouri River headwaters, the site of the [[Battle of Little Bighorn]], and three of the five entrances to Yellowstone National Park.{{sfn|Tourism in Montana|2007}}

Montana's personal [[income tax]] contains seven brackets, with rates ranging from 1.0 to 6.9 percent. Montana has no [[sales tax]], and household goods are exempt from [[property tax]]es. However, property taxes are assessed on livestock, farm machinery, heavy equipment, automobiles, trucks, and business equipment. The amount of property tax owed is not determined solely by the property's value. The property's value is multiplied by a tax rate, set by the Montana Legislature, to determine its taxable value. The taxable value is then multiplied by the [[mill levy]] established by various taxing jurisdictions—city and county government, school districts, and others.{{sfn|Department of Revenue|2012}}

In the 1980s the absence of a sales tax became economically deleterious to communities bound to the state's tourism industry, as the revenue from income and property taxes provided by residents was grossly insignificant in regards to paying for the impact of non-residential travel—especially road repair. In 1985, the Montana Legislature passed a law allowing towns with fewer than 5,500 residents and unincorporated communities with fewer than 2,500 to levy a resort tax if more than half the community's income came from tourism. The resort tax is a sales tax that applies to hotels, motels and other lodging and camping facilities; restaurants, fast-food stores, and other food service establishments; taverns, bars, night clubs, lounges, or other public establishments that serve alcohol; as well as destination ski resorts or other destination recreational facilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mtrevenue.gov/taxes/miscellaneous-taxes-and-fees/local-resort-tax/|title=Local Resort Tax|website=Montana Department of Revenue|access-date=December 8, 2019|archive-date=October 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191020205624/https://mtrevenue.gov/taxes/miscellaneous-taxes-and-fees/local-resort-tax/|url-status=live}}</ref>

It also applies to "luxuries"- defined by law as any item normally sold to the public or to transient visitors or tourists that does not include food purchased unprepared or unserved, medicine, medical supplies and services, appliances, hardware supplies and tools, or any necessities of life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/title_0070/chapter_0060/part_0150/section_0010/0070-0060-0150-0010.html|title=7-6-1501.

This extremely disproportionate ratio of residents paying taxes vs. non-residents using state-funded services and infrastructure makes Montana's resort tax crucial in order to safely maintain heavily used roads and highways, as well as protect and preserve state parks.

{{As of|2021|August}}, the state's unemployment rate is 3.5%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Local Area Unemployment Statistics|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|date=October 20, 2020|url=https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/lauhsthl.htm|access-date=October 24, 2020|archive-date=March 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190318233433/https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/lauhsthl.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

Many well-known artists, photographers and authors have documented the land, culture and people of Montana in the last 130 years. Painter and sculptor [[Charles Marion Russell]], known as "the cowboy artist", created more than 2,000 paintings of [[cowboy]]s, Native Americans, and landscapes set in the [[American West|Western United States]] and in [[Alberta]], Canada.{{sfn|University of Toronto|2000}} The [[C. M. Russell Museum Complex]] in [[Great Falls, Montana]], houses more than 2,000 Russell artworks, personal objects, and artifacts.<!--note the Montana Historical Society also has a CM Russell Gallery and assorted works-->

Pioneering feminist author, film-maker, and media personality [[Mary MacLane]] attained international fame in 1902 with her memoir of three months in her life in [[Butte, Montana|Butte]], ''The Story of Mary MacLane''. She referred to Butte throughout the rest of her career and remains a controversial figure there for her mixture of criticism and love for Butte and its people.

[[Evelyn Cameron]], a naturalist and photographer from [[Terry, Montana|Terry]] documented early 20th-century life on the Montana prairie, taking startlingly clear pictures of everything around her: cowboys, sheepherders, weddings, river crossings, freight wagons, people working, badlands, eagles, coyotes and wolves.{{sfn|Montana Travel|2010}}<!--add Schlechten bros, F Jay Haynes to photogs-->

===Major cultural events===
[[File:Crowdance.jpg|thumb|Dancers at Crow Fair in 1941]]

Montana hosts numerous arts and cultural festivals and events every year. Major events include:
* [[Bozeman, Montana|Bozeman]] was once known as the "Sweet Pea capital of the nation" referencing the prolific edible pea crop. To promote the area and celebrate its prosperity, local business owners began a "Sweet Pea Carnival" that included a parade and queen contest. The annual event lasted from 1906 to 1916. Promoters used the inedible but fragrant and colorful [[sweet pea]] flower as an emblem of the celebration. In 1977 the "Sweet Pea" concept was revived as an arts festival rather than a harvest celebration, growing into a three-day event that is one of the largest festivals in Montana.{{sfn|Hurlbut|Davis|2009|pp=179–181}}

====Professional sports====
There are no [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major league]] sports franchises in Montana due to the state's relatively small and dispersed population, but a number of [[minor league]] teams play in the state. [[Baseball]] is the minor-league sport with the longest heritage in the state and Montana is home to four [[Independent baseball league|independent]] teams, all members of the [[Pioneer League (baseball)|Pioneer League]]: the [[Billings Mustangs]], [[Great Falls Voyagers]], [[Missoula PaddleHeads]] and the [[Glacier Range Riders]].

====College sports====
All of Montana's four-year colleges and universities field intercollegiate sports teams. The two largest schools, the [[University of Montana-Missoula|University of Montana]] and [[Montana State University - Bozeman|Montana State University]], are members of the [[Big Sky Conference]] and have enjoyed a strong athletic rivalry since the early twentieth century. Six of Montana's smaller four-year schools are members of the [[Frontier Conference]].{{sfn|Frotier Conference|2013}} One is a member of the [[Great Northwest Athletic Conference]].{{sfn|Great Northwest Athletic Conference|2013}}

===Outdoor recreation===
Montana provides year-round outdoor recreation opportunities for residents and visitors. Hiking, fishing, hunting, watercraft recreation, camping, golf, cycling, horseback riding, and skiing are popular activities.{{sfn|Montana Outdoor Recreation|2013}}

====Fishing and hunting====
Montana has been a destination for its world-class trout fisheries since the 1930s.{{sfn|Schullery|2006a|pp=31–50}} [[Fly fishing]] for several species of native and introduced [[trout]] in rivers and lakes is popular for both residents and tourists throughout the state. Montana is the home of the [[Federation of Fly Fishers]] and hosts many of the organization's annual conclaves. The state has robust recreational [[lake trout]] and [[kokanee salmon]] fisheries in the west, [[walleye]] can be found in many parts of the state, while [[northern pike]], [[smallmouth bass|smallmouth]] and [[largemouth bass]] fisheries as well as [[catfish]] and [[paddlefish]] can be found in the waters of eastern Montana.{{sfn|Fisheries Management Plan|2013}} [[Robert Redford]]'s [[A River Runs Through It (film)|1992 film]] of [[Norman Mclean]]'s novel, ''[[A River Runs Through It (novel)|A River Runs Through It]]'', was filmed in Montana and brought national attention to fly fishing and the state.{{sfn|Schullery|2006b|pp=167–186}} Fishing makes up a sizeable component of Montana's total tourism economic output: in 2017, nonresidents generated $4.7 billion in economic output, of which, $1.3 billion was generated by visitor groups participating in guided fishing experiences.<ref>{{Cite web|title=2017 Economic Contribution and Industry-Client Analysis.|url=https://guide-x.io/blog/what-is-fly-fishing|access-date=May 13, 2021|website=guide-x.io|archive-date=May 13, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210513215136/https://guide-x.io/blog/what-is-fly-fishing|url-status=live}}</ref> <!--http://fwp.mt.gov/fishing/ will have most of what is needed-->

There are fall bow and general hunting seasons for [[elk]], [[Pronghorn|pronghorn antelope]], [[whitetail deer]] and [[mule deer]]. A random draw grants a limited number of permits for [[moose]], [[mountain goat]]s and [[bighorn sheep]]. There is a spring hunting season for [[American black bear|black bear]] and limited hunting of [[Yellowstone Park bison herd|bison that leave Yellowstone National Park]] has been allowed. Current law allows both hunters and trappers specified numbers ("limits") of [[wolf|wolves]] and [[mountain lion]]s. Trapping of assorted fur-bearing animals is allowed in certain seasons and many opportunities exist for migratory waterfowl and upland bird hunting.{{sfn|Montana Hunting Regulations|2012}}{{sfn|Montana Trapping|2013}} The [[Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation]], which protects wildlife habitat and promotes hunting heritage, was founded in Montana.

[[File:West Yellowstone MT - aerial edit.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Yellowstone Airport]], [[West Yellowstone, Montana]]]]

Railroads have been an important method of transportation in Montana since the 1880s. Historically, the state was traversed by the main lines of three east–west transcontinental routes: the [[Milwaukee Road]], the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern]], and the [[Northern Pacific Railway|Northern Pacific]]. Today, the [[BNSF Railway]] is the state's largest railroad, its main transcontinental route incorporating the former Great Northern main line across the state. [[Montana RailLink]], a privately held [[Class II railroad]], operated former Northern Pacific trackage in western Montana before being bought out by BNSF.<!--MRL coverage area needs to be specified more precisely, maybe mention significance of Washington Corporation-->

In addition, [[Amtrak]]'s ''[[Empire Builder]]'' train runs through the north of the state, stopping in [[Libby, Montana|Libby]], [[Whitefish, Montana|Whitefish]], [[West Glacier, Montana|West Glacier]], [[Essex, Montana|Essex]], [[East Glacier Park Village, Montana|East Glacier Park]], [[Browning, Montana|Browning]], [[Cut Bank, Montana|Cut Bank]], [[Shelby, Montana|Shelby]], [[Havre, Montana|Havre]], [[Malta, Montana|Malta]], [[Glasgow, Montana|Glasgow]], and [[Wolf Point, Montana|Wolf Point]].

Intercity bus service in Montana is provided by [[Jefferson Lines]] and Express Arrow.

[[Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport]] is the busiest airport in the state of Montana, surpassing [[Billings Logan International Airport]] in the spring of 2013.{{sfn|Bacaj|2013}}{{sfn|KTVQ|2013}} Montana's other major airports include [[Missoula International Airport]], [[Great Falls International Airport]], [[Glacier Park International Airport]], [[Helena Regional Airport]], [[Bert Mooney Airport]], and [[Yellowstone Airport]].<!--rank in order of how busy/big they are--> Eight smaller communities have airports designated for commercial service under the [[Essential Air Service]] program.{{sfn|Department of Transportation|2012}}

Historically, [[U.S. Route 10]] was the primary east–west highway route across Montana, connecting the major cities in the southern half of the state. Still, the state's most important east–west travel corridor, the route is today served by [[Interstate 90]] and [[Interstate 94]] which roughly follow the same route as the Northern Pacific. [[U.S. Route 2|U.S. Routes 2]] and [[U.S. Route 12|12]] and [[Montana Highway 200]] also traverse the entire state from east to west.

Montana's only north–south [[Interstate Highway]] is [[Interstate 15 in Montana|Interstate 15]]. Other major north–south highways include [[U.S. Route 87|U.S. Routes 87]], [[U.S. Route 89|89]], [[U.S. Route 93|93]], and [[U.S. Route 191|191]].

Montana and [[South Dakota]] are the only states to share a land border that is not traversed by a paved road. Highway 212, the primary paved route between the two, passes through the northeast corner of Wyoming between Montana and South Dakota.{{sfn|Sites|2012}}{{sfn|Montana Transportation|2013}}

==Law and government==
{{Main|Montana State Government}}

===Constitution===
Montana is governed by a constitution. The first constitution was drafted by a constitutional convention in 1889, in preparation for statehood. Ninety percent of its language came from an 1884 constitution which was never acted upon by Congress for national political reasons. The 1889 constitution mimicked the structure of the [[United States Constitution]], as well as outlining almost the same civil and political rights for citizens. However, the 1889 Montana constitution significantly restricted the power of state government, the legislature was much more powerful than the executive branch, and the jurisdiction of the [[Montana District Courts|District Courts]] very specifically described.{{sfn|Elison|Snyder|2001|pp=3–4, 144}} Montana voters amended the 1889 constitution 37 times between 1889 and 1972.<ref>{{cite report|author=Montana Constitutional Convention|title=Proposed 1972 Constitution for the State of Montana: Official Text With Explanation|location=Helena, Mont.|year=1972|access-date=February 24, 2017|page=3|url=https://archive.org/details/proposed1972cons00montrich}}</ref> In 1914, Montana [[women's suffrage|granted women the vote]]. In 1916, Montana became the first state to elect a woman, [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive Republican]] [[Jeannette Rankin]], to Congress.{{sfn|Women's National History|2013}}{{sfn|Jeannette Rankin|2011}}

In 1971, Montana voters approved the call for a state constitutional convention. A new constitution was drafted, which made the legislative and executive branches much more equal in power and which was much less prescriptive in outlining powers, duties, and jurisdictions.{{sfn|Elison|Snyder|2001|p=144}} The draft included an expanded, more [[Progressivism|progressive]] list of civil and political rights, extended these rights to children for the first time, transferred administration of property taxes to the counties from the state, implemented new [[water rights]], eliminated [[sovereign immunity]], and gave the legislature greater power to spend tax revenues. The constitution was narrowly approved, 116,415 to 113,883, and declared ratified on June 20, 1972. Three issues that the constitutional convention was unable to resolve were submitted to voters simultaneously with the proposed constitution. Voters approved the legalization of gambling, a bicameral legislature, and retention of the death penalty.{{sfn|Elison|Snyder|2001|pp=16–18}}

The 1972 constitution has been amended 31 times as of 2015.<ref name="sos1972current">{{cite report|author=Montana Secretary of State|title=1972–Current Historical Constitutional Initiatives and Constitutional Amendments|location=Helena, Mont.|date=June 8, 2015|page=7|access-date=February 24, 2017|url=http://sos.mt.gov/Portals/142/Elections/Documents/Constitutional-Ballot-Issues-1972-Current.pdf|archive-date=March 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328230107/http://sos.mt.gov/Portals/142/Elections/Documents/Constitutional-Ballot-Issues-1972-Current.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> Major amendments include establishment of a [[Land reclamation|reclamation trust]] (funded by taxes on natural resource extraction) to restore mined land (1974); restoration of sovereign immunity, when such immunity has been approved by a two-thirds vote in each house (1974); establishment of a 90-day biennial (rather than annual) legislative session (1974); establishment of a coal tax trust fund, funded by a tax on coal extraction (1976); conversion of the mandatory decennial review of county government into a voluntary one, to be approved or disallowed by residents in each county (1978); conversion of the provision of public assistance from a mandatory civil right to a non-fundamental legislative prerogative (1988);{{sfn|Elison|Snyder|2001|pp=19–20}} a new constitutional right to hunt and fish (2004); a prohibition on [[gay marriage]] (2004); and a prohibition on new taxes on the sale or transfer of real property (2010).<ref name="sos1972current" /> In 1992, voters approved a constitutional amendment implementing [[term limits]] for certain statewide elected executive branch offices (governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, state auditor, attorney general, superintendent of public instruction) and for members of the [[Montana Legislature]]. Extensive new constitutional rights for victims of crime were approved in 2016.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lin|first=Frances|title='Marsy's Law' ballot measure certified|work=KXLH.com|date=December 6, 2016|access-date=February 25, 2017|url=http://www.kxlh.com/story/33943749/marsys-law-ballot-measure-certified|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226132454/http://www.kxlh.com/story/33943749/marsys-law-ballot-measure-certified|archive-date=February 26, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The 1972 constitution requires that voters determine every 20 years whether to hold a new constitutional convention. Voters turned down a new convention in 1990 (84 percent no){{sfn|Elison|Snyder|2001|p=19}} and again in 2010 (58.6 percent no).<ref>{{cite news|title=Election 2010: Montana|work=The New York Times|date=November 2010|access-date=February 25, 2017|url=https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2010/results/montana.html|archive-date=February 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207155659/http://www.nytimes.com/elections/2010/results/montana.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

There are also nine other statewide elected offices in the executive branch: Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, State Auditor (who also serves as Commissioner of Securities and Insurance), and Superintendent of Public Instruction. There are five public service commissioners, who are elected on a regional basis. (The Public Service Commission's jurisdiction is statewide.)

There are 18 departments and offices which make up the executive branch: Administration; Agriculture; Auditor (securities and insurance); Commerce; Corrections; Environmental Quality; Fish, Wildlife & Parks; Justice; Labor and Industry; Livestock; Military Affairs; Natural Resources and Conservation; Public Health and Human Services; Revenue; State; and Transportation. Elementary and secondary education are overseen by the Office of Public Instruction (led by the elected superintendent of public instruction), in cooperation with the governor-appointed Board of Public Education. Higher education is overseen by a governor-appointed Board of Regents, which in turn appoints a commissioner of higher education. The Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education acts in an executive capacity on behalf of the regents and oversees the state-run [[Montana University System]].

Independent state agencies not within a department or office include the Montana Arts Council, Montana Board of Crime Control, Montana Historical Society, Montana Public Employees Retirement Administration, Commissioner of Political Practices, the Montana Lottery, Office of the State Public Defender, Public Service Commission, the Montana School for the Deaf and Blind, the Montana State Fund (which operates the state's unemployment insurance, worker compensation, and self-insurance operations), the Montana State Library, and the Montana Teachers Retirement System.

Montana is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abc.utah.gov/about/control_states.html|title=Utah Dept of Alcoholic Beverage Control|website=abc.utah.gov|access-date=September 24, 2017|archive-date=January 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131032427/https://abc.utah.gov/about/control_states.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> It is an [[Division of property|equitable distribution]] and [[no-fault divorce]] state.

===Legislative===
The [[Montana Legislature]] is bicameral and consists of the 50-member [[Montana Senate]] and the 100-member [[Montana House of Representatives]]. The legislature meets in the [[Montana State Capitol]] in Helena in odd-numbered years for 90 days, beginning the first weekday of the year. The deadline for a legislator to introduce a general bill is the 40th legislative day. The deadline for a legislator to introduce an appropriations, revenue, or referendum bill is the 62nd legislative day. Senators serve four-year terms, while Representatives serve two-year terms. All members are limited to serving no more than eight years in a single 16-year period.

===Judicial===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2023}}
The [[Courts of Montana]] are established by the Constitution of Montana. The constitution requires the establishment of a [[Montana Supreme Court]] and [[Montana District Courts]], and permits the legislature to establish [[Montana inferior courts|Justice Courts]], [[Montana inferior courts|City Courts]], [[Montana inferior courts|Municipal Courts]], and other inferior courts such as the legislature sees fit to establish.

The Montana Supreme Court is the court of last resort in the Montana court system. The constitution of 1889 provided for the election of no fewer than three Supreme Court justices, and one chief justice. Each court member served a six-year term. The legislature increased the number of justices to five in 1919. The 1972 constitution lengthened the term of office to eight years and established the minimum number of justices at five. It allowed the legislature to increase the number of justices by two, which the legislature did in 1979. The Montana Supreme Court has the authority to declare acts of the legislature and executive unconstitutional under either the Montana or U.S. constitutions. Its decisions may be appealed directly to the U.S. Supreme Court. The [[Clerk of the Montana Supreme Court]] is also an elected position and serves a six-year term. Neither justices nor the clerk is term-limited.

[[Montana District Courts]] are the courts of general jurisdiction in Montana. There are no intermediate appellate courts. District Courts have jurisdiction primarily over most civil cases, cases involving a monetary claim against the state, felony criminal cases, probate, and cases at law and in equity. When so authorized by the legislature, actions of executive branch agencies may be appealed directly to a District Court. The District Courts also have ''de novo'' appellate jurisdiction from inferior courts ([[Montana inferior courts|city courts, justice courts, and municipal courts]]), and oversee naturalization proceedings. District Court judges are elected and serve six-year terms. They are not term-limited. There are 22 judicial districts in Montana, served by 56 District Courts and 46 District Court judges. The District Courts suffer from excessive workload, and the legislature has struggled to find a solution to the problem.

[[Montana Youth Courts]] were established by the Montana Youth Court Act of 1974. They are overseen by District Court judges. They consist of a chief probation officer, one or more juvenile probation officers, and support staff. Youth Courts have jurisdiction over misdemeanor and felony acts committed by those charged as a juvenile under the law. There is a Youth Court in every judicial district, and decisions of the Youth Court are appealable directly to the Montana Supreme Court.

The Montana Worker's Compensation Court was established by the Montana Workers' Compensation Act in 1975. There is a single Workers' Compensation Court. It has a single judge, appointed by the governor. The Worker's Compensation Court has statewide jurisdiction and holds trials in Billings, Great Falls, Helena, Kalispell, and Missoula. The court hears cases arising under the Montana Workers' Compensation Act and is the court of original jurisdiction for reviews of orders and regulations issued by the Montana Department of Labor and Industry. Decisions of the court are appealable directly to the Montana Supreme Court.

The [[Montana Water Court]] was established by the Montana Water Court Act of 1979. The Water Court consists of a chief water judge and four district water judges (Lower Missouri River Basin, Upper Missouri River Basin, Yellowstone River Basin, and Clark Fork River Basin). The court employs 12 permanent special masters. The Montana Judicial Nomination Commission develops short lists of nominees for all five Water Judges, who are then appointed by the Chief justice of the Montana Supreme Court (subject to confirmation by the Montana Senate). The Water Court adjudicates water rights claims under the Montana Water Use Act of 1973 and has statewide jurisdiction. District Courts have the authority to enforce decisions of the Water Court, but only the Montana Supreme Court has the authority to review decisions of the Water Court.

From 1889 to 1909, elections for judicial office in Montana were partisan. Beginning in 1909, these elections became nonpartisan. The Montana Supreme Court struck down the nonpartisan law in 1911 on technical grounds, but a new law was enacted in 1935 which barred political parties from endorsing, making contributions to, or making expenditures on behalf of or against judicial candidates. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Montana's judicial nonpartisan election law in {{cite court|litigants=American Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Bullock|vol=567|reporter=U.S.|opinion=____|court=Sup.Ct.|date=2012}}Although candidates must remain nonpartisan, spending by partisan entities is now permitted. Spending on state supreme court races exponentially increased to $1.6&nbsp;million in 2014, and to more than $1.6&nbsp;million in 2016 (both new records).

===Federal offices and courts===
The U.S. Constitution provides each state with two senators. Montana's two U.S. senators are [[Jon Tester]] (Democrat), who was reelected in 2018, and [[Steve Daines]] (Republican), first elected in 2014 and later reelected in 2020. The U.S. Constitution provides each state with a single representative, with additional representatives apportioned based on population. From statehood in 1889 until 1913, Montana was represented in the [[United States House of Representatives]] by a single representative, elected at-large. Montana received a second representative in 1913, following the 1910 census and reapportionment. Both members, however, were still elected at-large. Beginning in 1919, Montana moved to district, rather than at-large, elections for its two House members. This created [[Montana's 1st congressional district]] in the west and [[Montana's 2nd congressional district]] in the east. In the reapportionment following the 1990 census, Montana lost one of its House seats. The remaining seat was again elected at-large.

In the reapportionment following the 2020 census, Montana regained a House seat, increasing the state's number of representatives in the House to two after a thirty-year break, starting from 2023.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://apnews.com/article/montana-census-2020-747de9091fc5108e47dd5b97e06642a6|title=Rapid population growth gives Montana 2nd US House seat|last=Samuels|first=Iris|work=[[Associated Press]]|access-date=September 30, 2021|date=April 27, 2021|archive-date=September 14, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210914094106/https://apnews.com/article/montana-census-2020-747de9091fc5108e47dd5b97e06642a6|url-status=live}}</ref> Republicans [[Matt Rosendale]] and [[Ryan Zinke]] are the current officeholders.

Montana's Senate district is the fourth largest by area, behind Alaska, Texas, and California. The most notorious of Montana's early senators was [[William A. Clark]], a "[[Copper Kings|Copper King]]" and one of the 50 richest Americans ever. He is well known for having bribed his way into the U.S. Senate. Among Montana's most historically prominent senators are [[Thomas J. Walsh]] (serving from 1913 to 1933), who was President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt's choice for attorney general when he died; [[Burton K. Wheeler]] (serving from 1923 to 1947), an oft-mentioned presidential candidate and strong supporter of isolationism; [[Mike Mansfield]], the longest-serving [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate majority leader]] in U.S. history; [[Max Baucus]] (served 1978 to 2014), longest-serving U.S. senator in Montana history, and the senator who shepherded the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] through the Senate in 2010; and [[Lee Metcalf]] (served 1961 to 1978), a pioneer of the environmental movement.

Montana's House district is the largest congressional district in the United States by population, with just over 1,023,000 constituents. It is the second-largest House district by area, after Alaska's at-large congressional district. Of Montana's House delegates, [[Jeannette Rankin]] was the first woman to hold national office in the United States when she was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1916.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.house.gov/People/Listing/R/RANKIN,-Jeannette-(R000055)/|title=RANKIN, Jeannette {{!}} US House of Representatives: History, Art & Archives|website=history.house.gov|access-date=January 28, 2019|archive-date=January 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129064053/https://history.house.gov/People/Listing/R/RANKIN,-Jeannette-(R000055)/|url-status=live}}</ref> Also notable is Representative (later Senator) [[Thomas H.

Federal courts in Montana include the [[United States District Court for the District of Montana]] and the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Montana. Three former Montana politicians have been named judges on the U.S. District Court: [[Charles Nelson Pray]] (who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1907 to 1913), [[James F. Battin]] (who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1961 to 1969), and [[Paul G. Hatfield]] (who served as an appointed U.S. Senator in 1978). [[Brian Morris (judge)|Brian Morris]], who served as an associate justice of the Montana Supreme Court from 2005 to 2013, currently serves as a judge on the court.

[[File:United States presidential election in Montana, 2016.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Treemap]] of the popular vote by county, 2016 presidential election. Areas are in proportion to the number of votes cast in each county.]]

Elections in the state have been historically competitive, particularly for state-level offices. The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s strength in the state is gained from support among unionized miners and railroad workers, while farmers generally vote Republican.<!--need to merge and consolidate with material below-->

Montana has a history of voters [[Split-ticket voting|splitting their tickets]] and filling elected offices with individuals from both parties. Through the mid-20th century, the state had a tradition of "sending the liberals to Washington and the conservatives to Helena". Between 1988 and 2006, the pattern flipped, with voters more likely to elect conservatives to federal offices. There have also been long-term shifts in party control. From 1968 through 1988, the state was dominated by the Democratic Party, with Democratic governors for a 20-year period, and a Democratic majority of both the national congressional delegation and during many sessions of the state legislature. This pattern shifted, beginning with the 1988 election when Montana elected a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] governor for the first time since 1964 and sent a Republican to the U.S. Senate for the first time since 1948. This shift continued with the [[reapportionment]] of the state's legislative districts that took effect in 1994, when the Republican Party took control of both chambers of the state legislature, consolidating a Republican party dominance that lasted until the 2004 reapportionment produced more swing districts and a brief period of Democratic legislative majorities in the mid-2000s.{{sfn|Montana Legislature|2012}}

Montana has voted for the Republican nominee in all but two presidential elections since 1952.{{sfn|Montana 2012 Election|2013}} The state last supported a Democrat for president in 1992, when [[Bill Clinton]] won a plurality victory. However, since 1889 the state has voted for Democratic governors 60 percent of the time, and Republican governors 40 percent of the time. In the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]], Montana was considered a [[swing state]] and was ultimately won by Republican [[John McCain]] by a narrow margin of two percent.{{sfn|2008 Election|2008}}

At the state level, the pattern of split-ticket voting and divided government holds. Democrats hold one of the state's two U.S. Senate seats with [[Jon Tester]]. The state's congressional seats (now two districts, but until 2023, one [[Montana's at-large congressional district|at-large district]]) have been Republican since 1996, and its Class 2 Senate seat has been held by Republican [[Steve Daines]] since 2014. The two chambers of the state's legislature had split party control from 2004 to 2010, when that year's mid-term elections decisively returned both branches to Republican control. The [[Montana Senate]] is, as of 2021, controlled by Republicans 31 to 19, and the [[Montana House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] is currently 67 to 33. Historically, Republicans are strongest in the east, while Democrats are strongest in the west.

Montana had [[At-large|only one representative]] in the U.S. House after having lost its second district in the 1990 census reapportionment. However, it regained its second district due to reapportionment following the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]]. Before the 2020 reapportionment, Montana's at-large congressional district held the largest population of any district in the country, which means its one member in the House of Representatives represented more people than any other member of the U.S. House (see [[List of U.S. states by population]]).<ref>[https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-08.pdf "Congressional Apportionment: 2010 Census Briefs"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119155913/http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-08.pdf |date=November 19, 2011 }} (PDF).
