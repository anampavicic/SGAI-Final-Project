'''Norfolk''' ({{IPAc-en|local|audio=Pronounce Norfolk Virginia.ogg|ˈ|n|ɔːr|f|ʊ|k}} {{respell|NOR|fuuk}}) is an [[independent city (United States)|independent city]] in [[Virginia]], United States. As of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], Norfolk had a population of 238,005, making it the [[List of cities in Virginia|third-most populous city in Virginia]] after neighboring [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]] and [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]], and the [[List of United States cities by population|96th-most populous city in the nation]].<ref name="QF2020">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/norfolkcityvirginia/POP010220 |title=QuickFacts: Norfolk city, Virginia |website=census.gov |access-date=2021-10-06}}</ref> Norfolk holds a strategic position as the historical, urban, financial, and cultural center of the [[Hampton Roads]] region (sometimes called "[[Tidewater (region)|Tidewater]]"), which has more than 1.8 million inhabitants and is the [[Metropolitan statistical area|37th-largest metropolitan area]] in the U.S., with ten cities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Where is "Tidewater" in Virginia? Hampton Roads? |url=http://www.virginiaplaces.org/chesbay/11chesa.html |website=Virginia Places}}</ref>

Norfolk was incorporated in 1705.{{citation needed|date=October 2024}} Bordered to the west by the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]] and to the north by the [[Chesapeake Bay]], the city shares land borders with the independent cities of Chesapeake to its south and Virginia Beach to its east. With coastline along multiple bodies of water, Norfolk has many miles of riverfront and bayfront property, including beaches on the Chesapeake Bay. The coastal zones are important for the economy. The largest naval base in the world, [[Naval Station Norfolk]], is located in Norfolk along with one of [[NATO]]'s two [[Allied Command Transformation|Strategic Command headquarters]]. Additionally, Norfolk is an important contributor to the [[Port of Virginia]]. It is home to [[A. P. Moller-Maersk Group#Maersk Line, Limited|Maersk Line, Limited]], which manages the world's largest fleet of [[Flag State|US-flag vessels]]. This low-lying coastal infrastructure is very vulnerable to [[sea level rise]], with water levels expected to rise by more than {{Convert|5.5|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} by the end of the 21st century.

The city has a long history as a strategic military and transportation point, where many railroad lines started. It is linked to its neighbors by an extensive network of [[Interstate Highway System|interstate highways]], [[bridge]]s, [[tunnel]]s, and three [[bridge-tunnel]] complexes.

{{more citations needed section|date=October 2024}}

===Before 1607===
In the late sixteenth century, the area that is now Norfolk was inhabited by the Chesepian people, who referred to the land as "K'che-sepi-ack." According to historical accounts from William Strachy, the Chesepian settlements were destroyed by the Powhatan shortly before the establishment of Jamestown in 1607.{{Citation needed|date=September 2024}}

===Colonial era===
Norfolk's lands were some of the first to draw settlers from the [[Virginia Colony]], although Norfolk would not be incorporated as a town until the 1700s. When the establishment of the [[House of Burgesses]] introduced representative government to the colony in 1619, governor [[George Yeardley|Sir George Yeardley]] divided the developed portion the colony into four incorporated jurisdictions, termed ''citties.'' The land on which Norfolk now sits fell under [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]] incorporation.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

In 1634 [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] reorganized the colony into a system of [[shires of Virginia|shires]], and [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]] became [[Elizabeth City Shire]]. After persuading 105 people to settle in the colony, [[Adam Thoroughgood]] (who had immigrated to Virginia in 1622 from [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]], [[England]]) was granted a large land holding, through the head rights system, along the [[Lynnhaven River]] in 1636.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

When the [[South Hampton Roads]] portion of the shire was separated, Thoroughgood suggested the name of his birthplace for the newly formed [[New Norfolk County, Virginia|New Norfolk County]]. One year later, it was divided into two counties, [[Upper Norfolk County|Upper Norfolk]] and [[Lower Norfolk County, Virginia|Lower Norfolk]] (the latter now incorporated into the City of Norfolk), chiefly on Thoroughgood's recommendation.<ref name="Norfolk History Chapter 4">{{cite web |url=http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/04.html |title=The Origins of Norfolk's Name |access-date=October 9, 2007 |publisher=Norfolk Historical Society |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910230143/http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/04.html |archive-date=September 10, 2007}}</ref> This area of Virginia became known as the place of entrepreneurs, including men of the [[London Company|Virginia Company of London]].{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

Norfolk developed in the late-seventeenth century as a "Half Moone" fort was constructed and {{cvt|50|acre|m2}} were acquired from local natives of the [[Powhatan Confederacy]] in exchange for 10,000 pounds of tobacco.

Norfolk was incorporated in 1705. In 1730, a tobacco inspection site was located here. According to the [[Tobacco Inspection Act]], the inspection was ''"At Norfolk Town, upon the fort land, in the County of Norfolk; and [[Kempsville, Virginia|Kemp's Landing]], in Princess Anne, under one inspection."'' In 1736 [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] granted it a royal charter as a borough.<ref name="Norfolk History Chapter 9">{{cite web |url=http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/09.html |title=Norfolk Becomes a Borough |access-date=October 9, 2007 |publisher=Norfolk Historical Society |archive-date=March 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313153644/http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/09.html |url-status=dead}}</ref> It was an important port for exporting goods to the British Isles and beyond.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

Mercantile ties with the [[British Empire]] bolstered Norfolk's base of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] support during the early part of the [[American Revolution]] but were insufficient to allow the Royal Governor of Virginia [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore]] to make Norfolk his new capital after fleeing Williamsburg in 1775. On New Year's Day, 1776, Lord Dunmore's fleet of three ships shelled the city of Norfolk for more than eight hours. The gunfire, combined with fires started by the British and spread by the Patriots, destroyed more than 800 buildings, constituting nearly two-thirds of the city. Patriot forces destroyed the remaining buildings for strategic reasons the following month. Ultimately, [[William Woodford|Colonel Woodford]] drove Dunmore into exile, ending more than 168 years of British rule in Virginia.<ref name="History from Colonial Williamsburg">{{cite web |url=http://www.history.org/Almanack/resources/dateline/polcron.cfm#seeds |title=Cultural & Political Chronology (1750–1783) |access-date=September 30, 2007 |publisher=Colonial Williamsburg}}</ref><ref>Guy, Louis L. jr.[http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/insights/2001_spring/nightmare.html "Norfolk's Worst Nightmare"] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629224630/http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/insights/2001_spring/nightmare.html|date=June 29, 2018 }}, Norfolk Historical Society ''Courier'' (Spring 2001), accessed January 3, 2008</ref> Only the walls of [[Saint Paul's Episcopal Church (Norfolk, Virginia)|Saint Paul's Episcopal Church]] survived the bombardment and subsequent fires.

Following recovery from the Revolutionary War's burning, Norfolk and its citizens struggled to rebuild. In 1804, another serious fire along the city's waterfront destroyed some 300 buildings and the city suffered a serious economic setback. In the [[War of 1812]] between America and Great Britain, Norfolk saw action between American militia led by Richard Lawson and the British navy. On July 13, 1813. A British landing party of 8 marines and 16 sailors landed at the beaches of Norfolk to construct a well and gather water. Richard Lawson concealed his company of militia behind a benign looking sandhill. Richard Lawson and his militia sprang their ambush by opening fire from their concealment behind the Sandhills. The British landing party who suffered 3 marines killed surrendered. Richard Lawson who suffered none killed had his militia destroy the British boat, take all provisions, and take the brass cannon. The American militia under Lawson returned to town with their prisoners.<ref name="Durant">{{cite book |last=Hannings |first=Bud |date=2012 |title=The War of 1812: A Complete Chronology with Biographies of 63 General Officers |location=Jefferson,NC  |publisher=McFarland; Illustrated edition |pages=138 |isbn=978-0786463855 }}</ref> During the 1820s, agrarian communities across the [[Southern United States|American South]] suffered a prolonged recession, which caused many families to migrate to other areas. Many moved west into the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]], or further into [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]]. This migration also followed the exhaustion of soil due to [[tobacco]] cultivation in the Tidewater, where it had been the primary commodity crop for generations.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

Virginia made some attempts to phase out [[slavery]] and [[manumission]]s increased in the two decades following the war. [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]] gained passage of an 1832 resolution for gradual abolition in the state. However, by that time the increased demand from the settlement of the lower South states had created a large internal market for slavery. The invention of the [[cotton gin]] in the late-eighteenth century had made profitable the cultivation of short-staple cotton in the uplands, which was widely practiced.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

[[File:Joseph Jenkins Roberts.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph Jenkins Roberts]], born and raised in Norfolk, became the first [[President of Liberia]]]]

The [[American Colonization Society]] proposed to "[[Back-to-Africa movement|repatriate]]" free blacks and freed slaves to Africa by establishing the new colony of Liberia and paying for transportation. But most African Americans wanted to stay in their birthplace of the United States and achieve freedom and rights there. For a period, many emigrants to Liberia from Virginia and [[North Carolina]] embarked from the port of Norfolk. [[Joseph Jenkins Roberts]], a [[free person of color]] native to Norfolk, emigrated via the American Colonization Society and later was elected as the first president of [[Liberia]], establishing a powerful family.<ref name="Roberts">{{cite web |url=http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/754/Joseph_Roberts_Liberias_first_President |title=Joseph Roberts, Liberia's first President! |access-date=February 19, 2008 |publisher=The African-American Registry |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123023225/http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/754/Joseph_Roberts_Liberias_first_President <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=November 23, 2007}}</ref>

The ship had just sailed from the [[West Indies]], where there had been an outbreak of [[yellow fever]]. The port health officer ordered the ship quarantined. After eleven days, a second inspection found no issues, so it was allowed to dock. A few days later, the first cases of yellow fever were discovered in Norfolk, and a machinist died from the disease on July 8. By August, several people were dying per day, and a third of the city's population had fled in the hopes of escaping the epidemic. No one understood how the disease was transmitted. With both Norfolk and Portsmouth being infected, New York banned all traffic from those sites. Neighboring cities also banned residents from Norfolk. The epidemic spread through the city via mosquitoes and poor sanitation, affecting every family and causing widespread panic. The number of infected reached 5,000 in September, and by the second week, 1,500 had died in Norfolk and Portsmouth.<ref>Donna, Bluemink YELLOW FEVER IN NORFOLK AND PORTSMOUTH, VIRGINIA, 1855,as reported in the DAILY DISPATCH of Richmond, Virginia 2005 accessed 29 September 2019.

1907 brought both the [[Virginian Railway]] and the [[Jamestown Exposition]] to [[Sewell's Point]]. The large [[Naval Review]] at the Exposition demonstrated the peninsula's favorable location and laid the groundwork for the world's largest naval base.

The establishment of the [[Interstate Highway System]] following World War II brought new highways to the region. A series of bridges and tunnels, constructed during fifteen years, linked Norfolk with [[Virginia Peninsula|the Peninsula]], [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]], and [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]]. In 1952, the [[Downtown Tunnel]] opened to connect Norfolk with the city of Portsmouth. The highways also stimulated the development of new housing suburbs, leading to the population spreading out. Additional bridges and tunnels included the [[Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel]] in 1957,<ref name="Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel">{{cite web |url=http://www.roadstothefuture.com/I64_VA_HRBT.html |title=Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel |access-date=October 2, 2007 |publisher=Roads to the Future}}</ref> the [[Midtown Tunnel (Virginia)|Midtown Tunnel]] in 1962,<ref name="Midtown Tunnel">{{cite web |url=http://www.roadstothefuture.com/Mid_Tunn_Port_Norf_MLK.html |title=Midtown Tunnel Parallel Tube Project |access-date=October 2, 2007 |publisher=Roads to the Future}}</ref> and the [[Virginia Beach-Norfolk Expressway]] ([[Interstate 264 (Virginia)|Interstate 264]] and [[State Route 44 (Virginia 1980s)|State Route 44]]) in 1967.<ref name="Interstate 264">{{cite web |url=http://www.roadstothefuture.com/I264_VA_Desc.html |title=Interstate 264 in Virginia |access-date=October 2, 2007 |publisher=Roads to the Future}}</ref> In 1991, the new [[Downtown Tunnel]]/[[Berkley Bridge (Virginia)|Berkley Bridge]] complex opened a new system of multiple lanes of highway and interchanges connecting Downtown Norfolk and [[Interstate 464]] with the Downtown Tunnel tubes.<ref name="Downtown Tunnel">{{cite web |url=http://www.roadstothefuture.com/HR_Interstates_Freeways.html |title=Hampton Roads Area Interstates and Freeways |access-date=October 2, 2007 |publisher=Roads to the Future}}</ref>

In 1954 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that [[Racial segregation|segregated]] public schools were [[unconstitutional]], as the public system was supported by all taxpayers. It ordered [[racial integration|integration]], but Virginia pursued a policy of "[[massive resistance]]". (At this time, most black citizens were still [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] under the state's turn-of-the-century constitution and discriminatory practices related to voter registration and elections.) The [[Virginia General Assembly]] prohibited state funding for integrated public schools.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

In 1958, [[United States district court]]s in Virginia ordered schools to open for the first time on a racially integrated basis. In response, [[Governor of Virginia|Governor]] [[J. Lindsay Almond]] ordered the schools closed. The [[Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals]] declared the [[State law (United States)|state law]] to be in conflict with the [[Constitution of Virginia|state constitution]] and ordered all public schools to be funded, whether integrated or not. About ten days later, Almond capitulated and asked the General Assembly to rescind several "massive resistance" laws.<ref name="Massive Resistance">{{cite web |url=http://www.vahistorical.org/civilrights/massiveresistance.htm |title=Massive Resistance – The Civil Rights Movement in Virginia |access-date=August 9, 2007 |publisher=Virginia Historical Society |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915113935/http://www.vahistorical.org/civilrights/massiveresistance.htm |archive-date=September 15, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In February 1959, seventeen black children entered six previously segregated Norfolk public schools.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bly |first1=Antonio T. |title=The Thunder during the Storm-School Desegregation in Norfolk, Virginia, 1957–1959: A Local History |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2668221 |journal=The Journal of Negro Education |access-date=September 4, 2023 |pages=106–114 |doi=10.2307/2668221 |date=1998|volume=67 |issue=2 |jstor=2668221 }}</ref> ''[[The Virginian-Pilot|Virginian-Pilot]]'' editor [[Lenoir Chambers]] editorialized against massive resistance and earned the [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing]].<ref name="Lenoir Chambers">{{cite web |url=http://www.landmarkcom.com/about/history.php |title=Landmark Communications Company History |access-date=October 11, 2007 |publisher=Landmark Communications |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009234858/http://www.landmarkcom.com/about/history.php |archive-date=October 9, 2007}}</ref>

With new [[suburb]]an developments beckoning, many white middle-class residents [[White flight|moved out of the city]] along new highway routes, and Norfolk's population declined, a pattern repeated in numerous cities during the postwar era independently of segregation issues. In the late-1960s and early-1970s, the advent of newer suburban shopping destinations along with freeways spelled demise for the fortunes of downtown's [[Granby Street]] commercial corridor, located just a few blocks inland from the waterfront. The opening of malls and large shopping centers drew off retail business from Granby Street.<ref name="JANAF History">{{cite web |url=http://www.janafshopping.com/aboutjanaf.php |title=History of JANAF Shopping Center |access-date=August 9, 2007 |publisher=JANAF Shopping Center |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930065349/http://www.janafshopping.com/aboutjanaf.php |archive-date=September 30, 2007}}</ref>

Norfolk's city leaders began a long push to [[Urban renewal|revive its urban core]]. While Granby Street underwent decline, Norfolk city leaders focused on the waterfront and its collection of decaying piers and warehouses. Many obsolete shipping and warehousing facilities were demolished. In their place, planners created a new boulevard, Waterside Drive, along which many of the high-rise buildings in Norfolk's [[skyline]] have been erected. In 1983, the city and [[The Rouse Company]] developed the [[Waterside (Norfolk, Virginia)|Waterside]] festival marketplace to attract people back to the waterfront and catalyze further downtown redevelopment.<ref name="Waterside">{{cite web |url=http://www.watersidemarketplace.com/ |title=Waterside Marketplace |access-date=February 21, 2008 |publisher=Waterside |archive-date=March 5, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305190902/http://www.watersidemarketplace.com/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Waterside was redeveloped in 2017. Additionally, the waterfront area hosts the [[Nauticus|Nauticus maritime museum and science center]], [[Hampton Roads Naval Museum]], [[Nauticus#Half Moone Cruise and Celebration Center|Half-Moone Cruise and Celebration Center]], and the [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|USS ''Wisconsin'']]. Other facilities opened in the ensuing years, including the [[Harbor Park]] baseball stadium, home of the [[Norfolk Tides]] Triple-A [[minor league baseball]] team.

Norfolk is located in the upper-right quadrant; east is at the top.]]

The city is located at the southeastern corner of [[Virginia]] at the junction of the Elizabeth River and the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The Hampton Roads [[United States metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (officially known as the [[Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC MSA]]) is the [[Table of United States Metropolitan Statistical Areas|37th largest]] in the United States, with an estimated population of 1,716,624 in 2014.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}} The area includes the Virginia cities of Norfolk, [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]], [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]], [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], [[Poquoson, Virginia|Poquoson]], [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]], [[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]], [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], and the counties of [[Gloucester County, Virginia|Gloucester]], [[Isle of Wight County, Virginia|Isle of Wight]], [[James City County, Virginia|James City]], [[Mathews County, Virginia|Mathews]], and [[York County, Virginia|York]], as well as the [[North Carolina]] counties of [[Currituck County, North Carolina|Currituck]] and [[Gates County, North Carolina|Gates]]. The city of Norfolk is recognized as the central business district, while the Virginia Beach oceanside resort district and [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] are primarily centers of tourism. Virginia Beach is the most populated city within the MSA though it functions more as a suburb. Additionally, Norfolk is part of the Virginia Beach-Norfolk, VA-NC [[Combined Statistical Area]], which includes the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC MSA, the [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina Micropolitan Statistical Area]], and the [[Kill Devil Hills, NC]] Micropolitan Statistical Area. The CSA is the 32nd largest in the nation with an estimated population in 2013 of 1,810,266.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

In addition to extensive riverfront property, Norfolk has miles of bayfront resort property and beaches in the [[Willoughby Spit]] and [[Ocean View, Virginia|Ocean View]] communities.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

[[File:Downtown Norfolk during the day.jpg|thumb|Downtown Norfolk]]
When Norfolk was first settled, homes were made of wood and [[Framing (construction)|frame]] construction, similar to most medieval English-style homes. These homes had wide [[chimney]]s and [[Thatching|thatch roofs]]. Some decades after the town was first laid out in 1682, the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian architectural style]], which was popular in the [[Southern United States|South]] at the time, was used. [[Brick]] was considered more substantial construction; patterns were made by brick laid and [[Flemish bond]]. This style evolved to include projecting center pavilions, [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] windows, [[Baluster|balustraded]] roof decks, and two-story [[portico]]es. By 1740, homes, warehouses, stores, workshops, and taverns began to dot Norfolk's streets.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

Norfolk was burned down during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. After the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], Norfolk was rebuilt in the [[Federal architecture|Federal]] style, based on Roman ideals. Federal-style homes kept Georgian symmetry, though they had more refined decorations to look like [[New World]] homes. Federal homes had features such as narrow sidelights with an embracing [[fanlight]] around the doorway, giant porticoes, gable or flat roofs, and projecting bays on exterior walls. Rooms were oval, elliptical or octagonal. Few of these federal [[rowhouse]]s remain standing today. A majority of buildings were made of wood and had a simple construction.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

In the early nineteenth century, [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] architectural elements began to appear in the federal style row homes, such as [[Ionic order|ionic]] [[Classical order|columns]] in the porticoes and classic motifs over doorways and windows. Many [[Federal architecture|Federal-style]] row houses were modernized by placing a Greek-style porch at the front. Greek and Roman elements were integrated into public buildings such as the old City Hall, the old Norfolk Academy, and the Customs House.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

Greek-style homes gave way to [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] in the 1830s, which emphasized [[pointed arch]]es, steep [[gable]] roofs, towers and tracer-lead windows. The Freemason Baptist Church and St. Mary's Catholic Church are examples of Gothic Revival. [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] elements emerged in the 1840s including [[cupola]]s, [[veranda]]s, ornamental [[brickwork]], or [[Quoin (architecture)|corner quoins]]. Norfolk still had simple wooden structures among its more ornate buildings.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

[[High-rise]] buildings were first built in the late nineteenth century when structures such as the current Commodore Maury Hotel and the Royster Building were constructed to form the initial Norfolk skyline. Past styles were revived during the early years of the twentieth century. [[Bungalow]]s and apartment buildings became popular for those living in the city.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

As the [[Great Depression]] wore on, [[Art Deco]] emerged as a popular building style, as evidenced by the Post Office building downtown. Art Deco consisted of streamlined [[concrete]] faced appearance with smooth [[rock (geology)|stone]] or metal, with [[terracotta]], and trimming consisting of [[glass]] and colored [[tile]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

Norfolk has a variety of historic neighborhoods, notably Freemason and West Freemason. Some neighborhoods, such as [[Berkley, Virginia|Berkley]], were formerly cities and towns. Others, including [[Willoughby Spit]] and [[Ocean View, Virginia|Ocean View]], have a long history tied to the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The city's revitalization in recent decades has transformed neighborhoods such as [[Downtown Norfolk, Virginia|Downtown]], [[Ghent district|Ghent]] and [[Fairmount Park Neighborhood|Fairmount Park]]. Popular residential neighborhoods include Ghent, Colonial Place, Larchmont, North Shore, Edgewater, and Lafayette Shores.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pros & Cons of Living in Norfolk, Virginia |url=https://lifeinhamptonroadsva.com/living-in-norfolk-virginia-top-pros-and-cons/ |website=Life in Hampton Roads Virginia}}</ref>

===Climate===
Narrative below is based on climate data from the 1991–2020 period. Norfolk has a [[humid subtropical climate]] and its USDA Hardiness Zone is 8a. Spring arrives in March with mild days and cool nights, and by late May, the temperature has warmed up considerably to herald warm summer days. Summers are consistently warm and humid, but the nearby Atlantic Ocean often exercises a slight cooling effect on daytime high temperatures, but a slight warming effect on nighttime low temperatures (compared to areas farther inland). As such, temperatures reach {{cvt|90|°F}} or higher on an average 35&nbsp;days annually,<ref name="NWS Wakefield, VA (AKQ)"/> and {{cvt|100|°F|1}} are uncommon, occurring in fewer than one-third of all years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xmacis.rcc-acis.org/ |title=xmACIS2 |publisher=[[NOAA]] Regional Climate Centers |quote=1) "Single-Station → Seasonal time series"; 2) Annual max temp "maximum" or "number of days" ≥ 100; 3) "ORFthr" in the Station selection ID.}}</ref> On average, July is the warmest month, with a normal mean temperature of {{cvt|81.1|°F|1}}.<ref name="NWS Wakefield, VA (AKQ)"/> On average, July and August are the wettest months, due to frequent summer thunderstorm activity. In August and September, rainfall remains high, due to rising frequency of tropical activity (hurricanes and tropical storms), which can bring high winds and heavy rains. These usually brush Norfolk and only occasionally make landfalls in the area; the highest-risk period is mid-August to the end of September. [[Autumn|Fall]] is marked by mild to warm days and cooler nights. Winter is usually mild in Norfolk, with average winter days featuring lows near or slightly above freezing and highs in the upper-40s to mid-50s (8 to 13&nbsp;°C). On average, the coldest month of the year is January, with a normal mean temperature of {{cvt|42.2|°F|1}},<ref name="NWS Wakefield, VA (AKQ)"/> Snow occurs sporadically, with an average winter accumulation of {{cvt|6.2|in|cm|1}}.<ref name="NWS Wakefield, VA (AKQ)"/> Norfolk's record high was {{cvt|105|°F|0}} on August 7, 1918, and July 24 and 25, 2010, and the record low was {{cvt|−3|°F|0}} recorded on [[January 1985 Arctic outbreak|January 21, 1985]].<ref name="NWS Wakefield, VA (AKQ)"/>

For every 100 females, there were 104.6 males. For every 100 females aged 18 and over, there were 104.8 males.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Norfolk, Virginia}}
[[File:1888 Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co Advert for Norfolk.jpg|thumb|left|1888 advertisement for the Market Square [[A&P]]]]
Since Norfolk serves as the commercial and cultural center for the unusual geographical region of Hampton Roads (and in its political structure of independent cities), it can be difficult to separate the economic characteristics of Norfolk from that of the region as a whole.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

The waterways which almost completely surround the Hampton Roads region play an important part in the local economy. As a strategic location at the mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]], its protected deep-water channels serve as a major trade artery for the [[import]] and [[export]] of goods from across the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]], [[Midwestern United States|Mid-West]], and internationally.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}
[[File:Wisconsin museum.JPG|thumb|Nauticus and [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|USS ''Wisconsin'']]]]
In addition to commercial activities, Hampton Roads is a major military center, particularly for the [[United States Navy]], and Norfolk serves as the home for [[Naval Station Norfolk]], the world's largest naval installation. Located on [[Sewell's Point|Sewell's Point Peninsula]], in the northwest corner of the city, the station is the headquarters of the [[United States Fleet Forces Command]] (formerly known as the Atlantic Fleet), which compromises over 62,000 active-duty personnel, 75 ships, and 132 aircraft. The base also serves as the headquarters to [[NATO]]'s [[Allied Command Transformation]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-05-11 |title=The biggest naval bases in the US |url=https://www.naval-technology.com/features/featurethe-biggest-naval-bases-in-the-us-4144545/ |access-date=2020-05-20 |website=Naval Technology |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  |url=http://www.act.nato.int/contact-us |title=Contacts and Visits |publisher=Act.nato.int |date=2014-11-02 |access-date=2016-06-21}}</ref>

The region also plays an important role in defense contracting, with particular emphasis in the shipbuilding and ship repair businesses for the city of Norfolk. Major private shipyards located in Norfolk or the [[Hampton Roads]] area include: [[Huntington Ingalls Industries]] (formerly Northrop Grumman Newport News) in Newport News, [[BAE Systems Ship Repair|BAE Systems Norfolk Ship Repair]], [[General Dynamics]] [[National Steel and Shipbuilding Company|NASSCO]] Norfolk, and Colonna's Shipyard Inc., while the US Navy's [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]] is just across the [[Downtown Tunnel]] in [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]]. Most contracts fulfilled by these shipyards are issued by the Navy, though some private commercial repair also takes place. Over 35% of Gross Regional Product (which includes the entire Norfolk-Newport News-Virginia Beach MSA), is attributable to defense spending, and that 75% of all regional growth since 2001 is attributable to increases in defense spending.<ref name="Hampton Roads Statistics">{{cite web |url=http://bpa.odu.edu/forecasting/sor/sor2004.shtml |title=State of the Region 2004 |access-date=February 21, 2008 |publisher=Old Dominion University |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120224242/http://bpa.odu.edu/forecasting/sor/sor2004.shtml |archive-date=January 20, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

After the military, the second largest and most important industry for Hampton Roads and Norfolk based on economic impact are the region's cargo ports. Headquartered in Norfolk, the [[Virginia Port Authority]] (VPA) is a [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]] owned entity that, in turn, owns and operates three major port facilities in Hampton Roads for break-bulk and container type cargo. In Norfolk, [[Norfolk International Terminals]] (NIT) represents one of those three facilities and is home to the world's largest and fastest container cranes.<ref name="NIT Facilities">{{cite web |url=http://www.vaports.com/Facilities/FAC-term-nit.htm |title=Norfolk International Terminals |access-date=August 6, 2007 |publisher=Virginia Port Authority |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803150402/http://www.vaports.com/Facilities/FAC-term-nit.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=August 3, 2007}}</ref> Together, the three terminals of the VPA handled a total of over 2 million [[containerization|TEUs]] and 475,000 tons of breakbulk cargo in 2006, making it the second busiest port on the east coast of North America by total cargo volume after the Port of New York and New Jersey.<ref name="Hampton Roads Ports">{{cite web |url=http://hreda.com/publicImages/downloadFiles/The%20Port%20of%20Hampton%20Roads.pdf |title=The Port of Hampton Roads |access-date=August 6, 2007 |publisher=Hampton Roads Economic Development Authority |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808212304/http://hreda.com/publicImages/downloadFiles/The%20Port%20of%20Hampton%20Roads.pdf |archive-date=August 8, 2007}}</ref>

In addition to NIT, Norfolk is home to the Lambert's Point docks, the largest coal trans-shipment point in the Northern Hemisphere,{{citation needed|date=January 2023}} with an annual capacity of approximately 48,000,000 tons.<ref name="v335">{{cite web |last=Gaffney |first=Augustyn| title=Coal Dust Is Blowin’ in the Wind | website=sierraclub.org | url=https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/coal-dust-blowin-wind | access-date=2024-06-06}}</ref> [[Bituminous coal]] is primarily sourced from the Appalachian mountains in western Virginia, [[West Virginia]], and [[Kentucky]]. The coal is loaded onto trains and sent to the port where it is unloaded onto large breakbulk cargo ships and destined for New England, Europe, and Asia.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

Between 1925 and 2007, [[Ford Motor Company]] operated [[Norfolk Assembly]], a manufacturing plant located on the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]] that had produced the Model-T, sedans and station wagons before building F-150 pick-up trucks.<ref name="vp1">{{cite web |title=Despite Ford's troubles, Norfolk plant is likely to keep on truckin' |publisher=Jeremiah McWilliams, The Virginian-Pilot November 11, 2005 |url=http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story=95163&ran=106860 |access-date=April 11, 2008 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070811045236/http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story=95163&ran=106860 |archive-date=August 11, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Before it closed, the plant employed more than 2,600 people at the {{cvt|2800000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility.<ref name="vp1"/>

Most major shipping lines have a permanent presence in the region with some combination of sales, distribution, and/or logistical offices, many of which are located in Norfolk. In addition, many of the largest international shipping companies have chosen Norfolk as their North American headquarters. These companies are either located at the [[Norfolk World Trade Center]] building or have constructed buildings in the Lake Wright Executive Center [[office park]]. The French firm [[CMA CGM]], the Israeli firm [[Zim Integrated Shipping Services]], and [[Maersk Line|Maersk Line Limited]], a subsidiary of the world's largest shipping line, [[A. P.

Though [[Virginia Beach]] and [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] have traditionally been the centers of tourism for the region, the rebirth of downtown Norfolk and the construction of a cruise ship pier at the foot of [[Nauticus]] in downtown has driven tourism to become an increasingly important part of the city's economy. The number of cruise ship passengers who visited Norfolk increased from 50,000 in 2003, to 107,000 in 2004 and 2005. Also in April 2007, the city completed construction on a $36 million state-of-the-art cruise ship terminal alongside the pier.<ref name="Half Moone Terminal">{{cite news |last=Richards |first=Gregory |title=Sleek new cruise terminal set to welcome travelers |url=http://hamptonroads.com/node/247981 |access-date=September 29, 2010 |newspaper=Virginian Pilot |date=April 7, 2007 |archive-date=January 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120102141/http://hamptonroads.com/node/247981 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Partly due to this construction, passenger counts dropped to 70,000 in 2006, but is expected to rebound to 90,000 in 2007, and higher in later years.

Norfolk is the cultural heart of the Hampton Roads region. In addition to its museums, Norfolk is the principal home for several major performing arts organizations. The city hosts numerous annual festivals and parades, many in [[Town Point Park]] or elsewhere in downtown.

=== Museums and galleries ===
The nationally acclaimed [[Chrysler Museum of Art]], the area's most comprehensive art museum, has its campus at the intersection of the [[Ghent district]], the Freemason neighborhood, and the NEON district.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chrysler Museum of Art |url=https://artsandculture.google.com/partner/chrysler-museum-of-art |website=Google Arts & Culture}}</ref> Since opening in 1933, the museum's main building has been expanded six times to allow for larger glass galleries, generous space for [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] and [[Baroque Art|Baroque]] works, and more.

The Chrysler Museum of Art also administers the 1792 Moses Myers House Museum in the Freemason District, next to MacArthur Mall. This museum interprets Norfolk's history and the lives and legacy of Norfolk's first Jewish family. Seventy percent of the objects in the home are original to the Myers in the early nineteenth century.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Moses Myers House {{!}} Historic House, Jewish History |url=https://chrysler.org/historic-houses/the-moses-myers-house/ |access-date=2023-01-20 |website=Chrysler Museum of Art |language=en}}</ref> The museum offers weekend tours and special monthly programming. In October 2022, the council of City of Norfolk, which owns the property, voted to proceed with the possibility of selling it, conjecturing the entirety of the property—the main house, the attached dwelling of the Myers’ enslaved servants, and the historic garden—could be sold as part of a package to developers, perhaps to operate as a bed and breakfast.<ref>{{Citation |title=Work Session – Norfolk City Council; October 11, 2022 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gd5mP3RMd7Q |language=en |access-date=2023-01-20}}</ref> Multiple entities, including the Norfolk Historical Society, have expressed distress and outrage.

Norfolk receives its electricity from [[Dominion Virginia Power]] which has local sources including the Chesapeake Energy Center (a gas power plant), coal-fired plants in [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]] and [[Southampton County, Virginia|Southampton County]], and the Surry Nuclear Power Plant. Norfolk-headquartered [[AGL Resources#Virginia Natural Gas|Virginia Natural Gas]], a subsidiary of [[AGL Resources]], distributes [[natural gas]] to the city from storage plants in [[James City County, Virginia|James City County]] and [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]].{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

Norfolk's water quality has been recognized one of the cleanest water systems in the United States and ranked as the fourth best in the United States by ''[[Men's Health (magazine)|Men's Health]]''.<ref name="Norfolk Utilities"/> The city of Norfolk has a tremendous capacity for clean fresh water. The city owns nine reservoirs: Lake Whitehurst, Little Creek Reservoir, Lake Lawson, Lake Smith, Lake Wright, Lake Burnt Mills, Western Branch Reservoir, Lake Prince and Lake Taylor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.norfolk.gov/Utilities/resources/default.asp |title=Utilities Water Resources, City of Norfolk |publisher=Norfolk.gov |access-date=May 14, 2012 |archive-date=May 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505113401/http://www.norfolk.gov/utilities/resources/default.asp |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Virginia tidewater area has grown faster than the local freshwater supply. The river water has always been salty, and the fresh groundwater is no longer available in most areas. Currently, water for the cities of Chesapeake and Virginia Beach is pumped from [[Lake Gaston]] (which straddles the Virginia-North Carolina border) into the City of Norfolk's reservoir system and then diverted to the City of Chesapeake for treatment by the City of Chesapeake. Virginia Beach's portion of water is treated by the City of Norfolk at Moores Bridges water treatment plant and then piped into Virginia Beach. The pipeline is {{cvt|76|mi|km}} long and {{cvt|60|in|mm}} in diameter.
