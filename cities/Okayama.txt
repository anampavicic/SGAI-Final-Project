==History==
===Sengoku period to Bakumatsu period ===
{{unreferencedsect|date=September 2024}}
[[File:Okayama Castle, IMG 5839-5841 AutoAdaptive.jpg|thumb|[[Okayama Castle]]]]

Before the [[Muromachi period]], Okayama was one corner of a farm region and included a small castle built by the Kanemitsu. In the [[Sengoku period]], [[Ukita Naoie]] attacked Okayama and attacked the castle for the transportation resources and extensive farmland in the region. Naoie remodeled the castle, built the old Sanyo road to the central part of the castle town, and called in craftsmen both from inside and outside of [[Bizen Province]]. Okayama became the political and economical capital of Bizen Province.

In 1600, [[Ukita Hideie]], who was the son of Naoie and the lord of Okayama, lost at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]]. The next year, [[Kobayakawa Hideaki]] came to Okayama and became the feudal lord of [[Okayama Domain]]. Hideaki died in 1602, however, ending the Kobayakawa line. Ikeda Tadatugu, who was the feudal lord of [[Himeji Domain]], became the next lord of Okayama. After this time, Okayama was ruled by the Ikedas until the latter part of the 19th century. Continuing its economic development, Okayama became one of the ten best large castle towns in Japan in the 18th century. The Korakuen Garden was developed by the fourth feudal lord, [[Ikeda Tsunamasa]].

===Meiji Restoration to World War II===
[[File:Okayama after the 1945 air raid.jpg|thumb|Okayama after World War II]]
{{Unreferencedsect|date=September 2024}}
On August 29, 1871, the new [[Meiji government]] of the [[Empire of Japan]] replaced the traditional [[Han (administrative division)|feudal domain system]] with centralized government authority. Okayama became the capital of Okayama Prefecture. In 1889, Okayama City was founded with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. In the [[Meiji period]], a [[San'yo Main Line]] railroad and other local lines greatly enhanced the development of the city. The {{nihongo|Sixth Higher Middle School|第六高等学校|Dairoku Kōtōgakkō}} and {{nihongo|Okayama Medical College|岡山医科大学|Okayama Ika-daigaku}} were established in Okayama City. Okayama became a center in western Japan for transportation and education. When [[World War II]] began, Okayama city was a garrison city for the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. On June 29, 1945, the city was attacked by the [[US Army Air Forces]] with [[incendiary bombs]].  Almost all the city was burned, and more than 1700 people were killed. Okayama suffered terrible damage in the war, losing more than 12,000 households.

===Since World War II===
During Japan's economic boom of the 1960s, Okayama developed rapidly as one of the most important cities in the Chūgoku and [[Shikoku]] regions. In 1972, the [[San'yō Shinkansen]] began service between {{STN|Shin-Ōsaka}} and {{STN|Okayama}} stations. Two years later, Shinkansen service was extended to {{STN|Hakata}}. In 1988, the [[Seto-Ōhashi Bridge]] was opened, and connected Okayama with Shikoku directly by rail and road.

The city became a [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] in 1996 and a [[designated city]] on April 1, 2009 with increased local autonomy.<ref>[http://www.kokudo.or.jp/marge/c_okayama.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807051713/http://www.kokudo.or.jp/marge/c_okayama.html|date=August 7, 2009}}</ref>

On March 22, 2005  the town of [[Mitsu, Okayama|Mitsu]] (from [[Mitsu District, Okayama|Mitsu District]]), and the town of [[Nadasaki, Okayama|Nadasaki]] (from [[Kojima District, Okayama|Kojima District]]) were merged into Okayama. This was followed on January 22, 2007 when the town of [[Takebe, Okayama|Takebe]] (from Mitsu District), and the town of [[Seto, Okayama|Seto]] (from [[Akaiwa District, Okayama|Akaiwa District]]) were merged into Okayama. Kojima, Mitsu, and Akaiwa Districts have all since been dissolved as a result of these mergers.


==Geography==
The city of Okayama is located in the southern part of Okayama Prefecture, which is located in western part of the island of [[Honshū]]. The northern part of the city forms a corner of Kibi Plateau, which is a series of gentle hills, and includes the Asahikawa Dam, Okayama Airport, and a suburban residential area. The central urban area is located on the Okayama Plain in the south, which was formed by the transportation and sedimentation of two first-class rivers, the [[Asahi River]] and [[Yoshii River]], which flow into the [[Seto Inland Sea]]. To the south of the main urban area is Kojima Bay, which forms the scenic Kojima Peninsula overlooking the Seto Inland Sea.

===Climate===
Okayama has a mild climate in comparison to most of Japan. It has the most rain-free days (less than 1mm of precipitation) of any city in Japan. It is ranked as the second driest and the fourth sunniest city in the Chūgoku region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pref.okayama.jp/kikaku/kokusai/momo/e/gaiyou/gaiyou.html |title=Outline of Okayama |publisher=Pref.okayama.jp |access-date=2013-10-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102235712/http://www.pref.okayama.jp/kikaku/kokusai/momo/e/gaiyou/gaiyou.html |archive-date=2013-01-02 }}</ref> The climate is classified under the [[Köppen climate classification]] as [[humid subtropical]] (''Cfa'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/ |title=World Maps of Köppen-Geiger climate classification |publisher=Koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at |access-date=2013-10-04}}</ref>

The local climate is warm enough throughout the year to support [[olive]] trees. Okayama is often called "Land of Sunshine" because of its low number of rainy days per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pref.okayama.jp/soshiki/detail.html?lif_id=2143 |script-title=ja:大好き「晴れの国おかやま」 １ 岡山県のアウトライン（県の概況、シンボルなど） - 岡山県ホームページ|publisher=Pref.okayama.jp|access-date=2013-10-04|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720014319/http://www.pref.okayama.jp/soshiki/detail.html?lif_id=2143|archive-date=2011-07-20}}</ref>
