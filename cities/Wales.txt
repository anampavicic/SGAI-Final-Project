It is bordered by the [[Irish Sea]] to the north and west, [[England]] to the [[England–Wales border|east]], the [[Bristol Channel]] to the south, and the [[Celtic Sea]] to the south-west. {{As of|2021}}, it had a population of 3.2 million.<ref name="2021 Nomis"/> It has a total area of {{convert|21218|km2|sqmi}} and over {{convert|1680|mi|order=flip}} of [[coastline]].<ref name="ONS Standard Area Measurement"/> It is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including [[Snowdon]] ({{lang|cy|Yr Wyddfa}}), its highest summit.<ref name="ONS Geography Guide">{{cite web |url=https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/a-beginners-guide-to-uk-geography-2023/about |title=A Beginners Guide to UK Geography (2023) |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=24 August 2023 |website=Open Geography Portal |publisher=Office for National Statistics |access-date=9 December 2023}}</ref> The country lies within the [[Temperate climate|north temperate zone]] and has a changeable, [[Oceanic climate|maritime climate]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Cardiff]].

A distinct [[Culture of Wales|Welsh culture]] emerged among the [[Celtic Britons]] after the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman withdrawal from Britain]] in the 5th century, and Wales was briefly united under [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]] in 1055. After over 200 years of war, the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|conquest of Wales]] by King [[Edward I of England]] was completed by 1283, though [[Owain Glyndŵr]] led the [[Welsh Revolt]] against [[Wales in the Late Middle Ages|English rule]] in the early 15th century, and briefly re-established an independent Welsh state with its own national parliament ({{Langx|cy|senedd}}). In the 16th century the whole of Wales was [[Annexation|annexed]] by England and incorporated within the [[English law|English legal system]] under the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]]. Distinctive [[Politics of Wales|Welsh politics]] developed in the 19th century. [[Welsh Liberal Party|Welsh Liberalism]], exemplified in the early 20th century by [[David Lloyd George]], was displaced by the growth of [[socialism]] and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Welsh national feeling grew over the century: a [[Nationalism|nationalist]] party, {{lang|cy|[[Plaid Cymru]]|italic=no}}, was formed in 1925, and the [[Welsh Language Society]] in 1962. A governing system of [[Welsh devolution]] is employed in Wales, of which the most major step was the formation of the {{lang|cy|[[Senedd]]|italic=no}} (Welsh Parliament, formerly the National Assembly for Wales) in 1998, responsible for a range of [[Welsh law|devolved policy matters]].

At the dawn of the [[Industrial Revolution in Wales|Industrial Revolution]], development of the [[Mining in Wales|mining]] and [[Metallurgy|metallurgical]] industries transformed the country from an [[Agrarian society|agricultural society]] into an [[Industrial society|industrial]] one; the [[South Wales Coalfield]]'s exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales's population. Two-thirds of the population live in [[South Wales]], including Cardiff, [[Swansea]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], and the [[South Wales Valleys|nearby valleys]]. The [[North East Wales|eastern region]] of [[North Wales]] has about a sixth of the overall population, with [[Wrexham]] being the largest northern city. The remaining parts of Wales are [[Population density|sparsely populated]]. Since decline of the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries, the [[public sector]], light and service industries, and [[Tourism in Wales|tourism]] play major roles in its [[Economy of Wales|economy]]. [[Agriculture in Wales]] is largely livestock-based, making Wales a net exporter of animal produce, contributing towards national [[Autarky|agricultural self-sufficiency]].

Both [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and English are [[official language]]s. A majority of the population of Wales speaks English. Welsh is the dominant language in parts of the [[North Wales|north]] and [[West Wales|west]], with a total of 538,300 [[Welsh language#Status|Welsh speakers]] across the entire country. Wales has [[List of World Heritage Sites in Wales|four UNESCO world heritage sites]], of which three are in the north.

==Etymology==
{{main|Etymology of Wales|Cymru}}
The English words "Wales" and "Welsh" derive from the same [[Old English]] root (singular {{lang|ang|[[*Walhaz|Wealh]]}}, plural {{lang|ang|Wēalas}}), a descendant of [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|[[*Walhaz|Walhaz]]}}, which was itself derived from the name of the [[Gauls]] known to the Romans as [[Volcae]]. This term was later used to refer indiscriminately to inhabitants of the [[Western Roman Empire]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Miller |first=Katherine L. |date=2014 |title=The Semantic Field of Slavery in Old English: Wealh, Esne, Þræl |url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/8031/1/Katherine%20Miller%20Semantic%20Field%20of%20Slavery%20in%20Old%20English%20v%203.pdf |access-date=8 August 2019 |publisher=University of Leeds |type=Doctoral dissertation}}</ref> [[Anglo-Saxons]] came to use the term to refer to the [[Celtic Britons|Britons]] in particular; the plural form {{lang|ang|Wēalas}} evolved into the name for their territory, Wales.<ref name="Wales Hist 71">Davies (1994) p. 71</ref><ref name="Tolkien 1">{{Cite book |last=Tolkien |first=J.

The 400-year period following the collapse of Roman rule is the most difficult to interpret in the history of Wales.<ref name="Davies915"/> After the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure]] in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various [[Germanic peoples]], commonly known as Anglo-Saxons.

By AD 500 the land that would become Wales had divided into a number of kingdoms free from Anglo-Saxon rule.<ref name="Davies915"/> The kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]], [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]], [[Kingdom of Dyfed|Dyfed]], [[Kingdom of Ceredigion|Caredigion]], [[Glywysing|Morgannwg]], the [[Ystrad Tywi]], and [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]] emerged as independent Welsh [[Succession of states|successor states]].<ref name="Davies915"/> Archaeological evidence, in the Low Countries and what was to become England, shows early Anglo-Saxon migration to Great Britain reversed between 500 and 550, which concurs with Frankish chronicles.<ref name="Davies56">Davies (1994) pp. 56</ref> John Davies notes this as consistent with a victory for the [[Celtic Britons]] at [[Battle of Badon|Badon Hill]] against the Saxons, which was attributed to [[King Arthur|Arthur]] by [[Nennius]].<ref name="Davies56"/>

Having lost much of what is now the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] to [[Mercia]] in the 6th and early 7th centuries, a resurgent late-7th-century Powys checked Mercian advances. [[Æthelbald of Mercia]], looking to defend recently acquired lands, had built [[Wat's Dyke]]. According to Davies, this had been with the agreement of king [[Elisedd ap Gwylog]] of Powys, as this boundary, extending north from the valley of the [[River Severn]] to the Dee estuary, gave him [[Oswestry]].<ref name="Hist Wales 65-66">Davies (1994) pp. 65–66</ref> Another theory, after carbon dating placed the dyke's existence 300 years earlier, is that it was built by the post-Roman rulers of [[Wroxeter]].<ref>Davies (2008) p. 926</ref> King [[Offa of Mercia]] seems to have continued this initiative when he created a larger earthwork, now known as [[Offa's Dyke]] ({{lang|cy|Clawdd Offa}}). Davies wrote of [[Cyril Fox]]'s study of Offa's Dyke: "In the planning of it, there was a degree of consultation with the kings of Powys and Gwent. On the Long Mountain near [[Trelystan]], the dyke veers to the east, leaving the fertile slopes in the hands of the Welsh; near [[Ruabon|Rhiwabon]], it was designed to ensure that Cadell ap Brochwel retained possession of the Fortress of Penygadden." And, for Gwent, Offa had the dyke built "on the eastern crest of the gorge, clearly with the intention of recognizing<!--'recognizing' is the spelling used in John Davies' original text, and should be preserved uncorrected {{sic}}, per [[WP:MOSQUOTE]]. --> that the [[River Wye]] and its traffic belonged to the kingdom of Gwent."<ref name="Hist Wales 65-66"/> However, Fox's interpretations of both the length and purpose of the Dyke have been questioned by more recent research.<ref>David Hill and Margaret Worthington, ''Offa's Dyke: history and guide'', Tempus, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-7524-1958-9}}</ref>

The southern and eastern parts of Great Britain lost to English settlement became known in Welsh as {{lang|wlm|[[Lloegyr]]}} (Modern Welsh {{lang|cy|Lloegr}}), which may have referred to the kingdom of Mercia originally and which came to refer to England as a whole.{{Efn|The earliest instance of {{lang|wlm|Lloegyr}} occurs in the early 10th-century prophetic poem {{lang|cy|[[Armes Prydein]]}}. It seems comparatively late as a place name, the nominative plural {{lang|cy|[[Lloegyr|Lloegrwys]]}}, "men of {{lang|cy|Lloegr}}", being earlier and more common. The English were sometimes referred to as an entity in early poetry ({{lang|cy|Saeson}}, as today) but just as often as {{lang|cy|Eingl}} (Angles), {{lang|cy|Iwys}} (Wessex-men), etc. {{lang|cy|Lloegr}} and {{lang|cy|Sacson}} became the norm later when England emerged as a kingdom. As for its origins, some scholars have suggested that it originally referred only to [[Mercia]] – at that time a powerful kingdom and for centuries the main foe of the Welsh. It was then applied to the new kingdom of England as a whole (see for instance [[Rachel Bromwich]] (ed.), {{lang|cy|[[Welsh Triads|Trioedd Ynys Prydein]]}}, University of Wales Press, 1987). "The lost land" and other fanciful meanings, such as [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s monarch Locrinus, have no etymological basis. (See also Discussion in Reference 40)}} The Germanic tribes who now dominated these lands were invariably called {{lang|cy|Saeson}}, meaning "[[Saxons]]". The Anglo-Saxons called the Romano-British {{lang|gem-x-proto|[[*Walhaz|Walha]]}}, meaning 'Romanised foreigner' or 'stranger'.<ref name="Wales Hist 2">Davies (1994) p. 2</ref> The Welsh continued to call themselves {{lang|cy|Brythoniaid}} (Brythons or Britons) well into the [[Middle Ages]], though the first written evidence of the use of {{lang|cy|Cymru}} and {{lang|cy|y Cymry}} is found in a praise poem to {{lang|cy|[[Cadwallon ap Cadfan]]|italic=no}} ({{lang|cy|Moliant Cadwallon}}, by {{lang|cy|Afan Ferddig|italic=no}}) {{circa|633}}.<ref name="Wales Hist 71"/> In {{lang|cy|[[Armes Prydein]]}}, believed to be written around 930–942, the words {{lang|cy|Cymry}} and {{lang|cy|Cymro}} are used as often as 15 times.<ref>Davies (2008) p. 714</ref> However, from the Anglo-Saxon settlement onwards, the people gradually begin to adopt the name {{lang|cy|Cymry}} over {{lang|cy|Brythoniad}}.<ref name="Davies186">Davies (2008) p. 186</ref>

With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that connected it with Cornwall's copper mines in the south and the large copper deposits at [[Parys Mountain]] on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world's major centre for non-ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century.<ref name="Davies392" /> The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron smelting, and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both the north and the south of the country.<ref name="Davies393">Davies (2008) p. 393</ref> In the north, [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]]'s Ironworks at [[Bersham]] was a major centre, while in the south, at [[Merthyr Tydfil]], the ironworks of [[Dowlais Ironworks|Dowlais]], [[Cyfarthfa Ironworks|Cyfarthfa]], Plymouth and [[Penydarren Ironworks|Penydarren]] became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales.<ref name="Davies393" /> By the 1820s, south Wales produced 40 per cent of all Britain's [[pig iron]].<ref name="Davies393" />

By the 18th century, lawyers, doctors, estate agents and government officials formed a [[bourgeoisie]] with sizeable houses.<ref name=":2" /> In the late 18th century, [[Slate industry in Wales|slate quarrying]] began to expand rapidly, most notably in North Wales. The [[Penrhyn quarry]], opened in 1770 by [[Richard Pennant, 1st Baron Penrhyn]], was employing 15,000 men by the late 19th century,<ref name="Davies818">Davies (2008) p. 818</ref> and along with [[Dinorwic quarry]], it dominated the Welsh slate trade. Although slate quarrying has been described as "the most Welsh of Welsh industries",<ref name="Davies819">Attributed to historian [[A. H. Dodd]]: Davies (2008) p. 819</ref> it is coal mining which became the industry synonymous with Wales and its people. Initially, coal seams were exploited to provide energy for local metal industries but, with the opening of canal systems and later the railways, Welsh coal mining saw an explosion in demand. As the [[South Wales Coalfield]] was exploited, Cardiff, Swansea, [[Penarth]] and [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]] grew as world exporters of coal. By its height in 1913, Wales was producing almost 61 million tons of coal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/1912/|title=Wales – the first industrial nation of the World|publisher=[[Amgueddfa Cymru – Museum Wales]]|date=5 October 2008|access-date=9 September 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003192341/http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/1912/|archive-date=3 October 2011}}</ref>

[[File:MametzWood Christopher Williams.jpg|thumb|right|''Battle at [[Mametz Wood Memorial|Mametz Wood]]'' by [[Christopher Williams (Welsh artist)|Christopher Williams]] (1918)]]
Historian [[Kenneth O. Morgan|Kenneth Morgan]] described Wales on the eve of the [[First World War]] as a "relatively placid, self-confident and successful nation". The output from the coalfields continued to increase, with the Rhondda Valley recording a peak of 9.6&nbsp;million tons of coal extracted in 1913.<ref>{{Cite book |last=John |first=Arthur H. |title=Glamorgan County History, Volume V, Industrial Glamorgan from 1700 to 1970 |publisher=University of Wales Press |year=1980 |location=Cardiff |page=183}}</ref> The First World War (1914–1918) saw a total of 272,924 Welshmen under arms, representing 21.5 per cent of the male population. Of these, roughly 35,000 were killed,<ref name="Davies284">Davies (2008) p. 284</ref> with particularly heavy losses of [[38th (Welsh) Infantry Division|Welsh forces]] at [[Mametz Wood Memorial|Mametz Wood]] on the Somme and the [[Battle of Passchendaele]].<ref>Davies (2008) p. 285</ref>

The first quarter of the 20th century also saw a shift in the political landscape of Wales. Since 1865, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] had held a parliamentary majority in Wales and, following the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1906]], only one non-Liberal Member of Parliament, [[Keir Hardie]] of [[Merthyr Tydfil (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil]], represented a Welsh constituency at Westminster. Yet by 1906, industrial dissension and political militancy had begun to undermine Liberal consensus in the southern coalfields.<ref name="Davies461">Davies (2008) p. 461</ref> In 1916, [[David Lloyd George]] became the first Welshman to become Prime Minister of Britain.<ref>{{Cite web |title=David Lloyd George (1863–1945) |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/figures/lloyd_george.shtml |access-date=26 September 2010 |website=[[BBC Cymru Wales]] website |publisher=[[BBC Cymru Wales]]}}</ref> In December 1918, Lloyd George was re-elected as the head of a Conservative-dominated coalition government, and his poor handling of the 1919 coal miners' strike was a key factor in destroying support for the Liberal party in south Wales.<ref name="Davies515">Davies (2008) p. 515</ref> The industrial workers of Wales began shifting towards the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. When in 1908 the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|Miners' Federation of Great Britain]] became affiliated to the Labour Party, the four Labour candidates sponsored by miners were all elected as MPs. By 1922, half the Welsh seats at Westminster were held by Labour politicians—the start of a Labour dominance of Welsh politics that continued into the 21st century.<ref name="Davies439">Davies (2008) p. 439</ref>

After economic growth in the first two decades of the 20th century, Wales's staple industries endured a prolonged slump from the early 1920s to the late 1930s, leading to widespread unemployment and poverty.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Morgan |first=Kenneth O. |url=https://archive.org/details/wales18801980reb0000morg/page/208 |title=Rebirth of a Nation: Wales 1880–1980 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-19-821760-2 |location=Oxford |pages=[https://archive.org/details/wales18801980reb0000morg/page/208 208–210]}}</ref> For the first time in centuries, the population of Wales went into decline; unemployment reduced only with the production demands of the [[Second World War]].<ref>Davies (2008) p. 918</ref> The war saw Welsh servicemen and women fight in all major theatres, with some 15,000 of them killed. Bombing raids brought high loss of life as the [[Luftwaffe|German Air Force]] targeted the docks at [[Swansea Blitz|Swansea]], [[Cardiff Blitz|Cardiff]] and [[Pembroke Dock|Pembroke]]. After 1943, 10 per cent of Welsh conscripts aged 18 were sent to work in the coal mines, where there were labour shortages; they became known as [[Bevin Boys]]. [[Pacifism|Pacifist]] numbers during both World Wars were fairly low, especially in the Second World War, which was seen as a fight against [[fascism]].<ref name="Davies807">Davies (2008) p. 807</ref>

By the end of the 1960s, the policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy.<ref name="Davies236">Davies (2008) p. 236</ref> This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of [[industrial estates]] and improvements in transport communications,<ref name="Davies236" /> most notably the [[M4 motorway]] linking south Wales directly to London.

The [[Welsh Language Act 1967]] repealed a section of the [[Wales and Berwick Act 1746|Wales and Berwick Act]] and thus "Wales" was no longer part of the legal definition of England. This essentially defined Wales as a separate entity legally (but within the UK), for the first time since before the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]] which defined Wales as a part of the Kingdom of England. The [[Welsh Language Act 1967]] also expanded areas where use of Welsh was permitted, including in some legal situations.<ref>{{cite web|date=July 2011|title=The Constitution Series: 1 – Wales in the United Kingdom|url=http://www.assembly.wales/Research%20Documents/The%20Constitution%20Wales%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20-%20Quick%20guide-22072011-217207/qg07-0001-English.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420062743/http://www.assembly.wales/Research%20Documents/The%20Constitution%20Wales%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20-%20Quick%20guide-22072011-217207/qg07-0001-English.pdf|archive-date=20 April 2016|access-date=6 April 2016|publisher=National Assembly for Wales}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=History of devolution|url=https://senedd.wales/how-we-work/history-of-devolution/|access-date=31 January 2022|website=senedd.wales}}; {{cite web|date=26 July 2012|title=The Welsh language Act of 1967|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/entries/fe99df6b-bf61-3cb0-a695-fa76c013fc98|access-date=31 January 2022|website=BBC}}</ref>

In a [[1979 Welsh devolution referendum|referendum in 1979]], Wales voted against the creation of a Welsh assembly with an 80 per cent majority. In 1997, a [[1997 Welsh devolution referendum|second referendum]] on the same issue secured a very narrow majority (50.3 per cent).<ref name="Long Walk" /> The [[National Assembly for Wales]] (''Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru'') was set up in 1999 (under the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]]) with the power to determine how Wales's central government budget is spent and administered, although the UK Parliament reserved the right to set limits on its powers.<ref name="Long Walk">{{cite news |first= Betsan |last= Powys |title= The long Welsh walk to devolution |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/wales_politics/7813837.stm |access-date= 26 September 2010 |publisher= BBC |date= 12 January 2010 |work= [[BBC News]] website}}</ref>

The '[[Cyfraith Hywel|law of Hywel Dda]]' ({{langx|cy|Cyfraith Hywel}}), as it became known, codified the previously existing [[Celtic Law|folk laws and legal customs]] that had evolved in Wales over centuries.

English law has been the legal system of [[England and Wales]] since 1536.<ref name="Wales Hist 263">Davies (1994) p. 263</ref>

English law is regarded as a [[common law]] system, with no major [[Codification (law)|codification]] of the law and legal [[precedent]]s are binding as opposed to persuasive. The court system is headed by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] which is the highest court of appeal in the land for criminal and civil cases. The [[Senior Courts of England and Wales]] is the highest [[Trial court|court of first instance]] as well as an [[appellate court]]. The three divisions are the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court of Justice]], and the [[Crown Court]]. Minor cases are heard by [[magistrates' court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]]s or the [[County Court]]. In 2007 the Wales and Cheshire Region (known as the Wales and Cheshire Circuit before 2005) came to an end when Cheshire was attached to the North-Western England Region. From that point, Wales became a legal unit in its own right, although it remains part of the single [[jurisdiction]] of [[England and Wales]].<ref>Davies (2008) p. 453</ref>

The [[Senedd]] has the authority to draft and approve laws outside of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliamentary]] system to meet the specific needs of Wales. Under powers approved by a [[2011 Welsh devolution referendum|referendum]] held in March 2011, it is empowered to pass primary legislation, at the time referred to as an Act of the National Assembly for Wales but now known as an [[Act of Senedd Cymru]] in relation to twenty subjects listed in the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]] such as health and education. Through this primary legislation, the [[Welsh Government]] can then also enact more specific [[secondary legislation|subordinate legislation]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Subordinate legislation |url=https://law.gov.wales/constitution-government/how-welsh-laws-made/subordinate-legislation/?lang=en#/constitution-government/how-welsh-laws-made/subordinate-legislation |website=law.gov.wales |publisher=Welsh Government |access-date=16 July 2020 |date=13 February 2015 |archive-date=19 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200619065644/https://law.gov.wales/constitution-government/how-welsh-laws-made/subordinate-legislation/?lang=en#/constitution-government/how-welsh-laws-made/subordinate-legislation |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Flora and fauna===
{{Main|Biodiversity of Wales}}

Wales's wildlife is typical of Britain with several distinctions. Because of its long coastline, Wales hosts a variety of seabirds. The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of [[northern gannet|gannet]]s, [[Manx shearwater]], [[Atlantic puffin|puffin]]s, [[black-legged kittiwake|kittiwakes]], [[European shag|shags]] and [[razorbill]]s. In comparison, with 60 per cent of Wales above the 150m contour, the country also supports a variety of upland-habitat birds, including [[common raven|raven]] and [[ring ouzel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecologymatters.co.uk/pdf/Wales_Ring_Ouzel_paper.pdf |title=Wales Ring Ouzel Survey 2006 |publisher=Ecology Matters Ltd. |last=Green |first=Mick |year=2007 |access-date=6 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311210912/http://www.ecologymatters.co.uk/pdf/Wales_Ring_Ouzel_paper.pdf |archive-date=11 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/4644626.stm |title=Black ravens return to the roost |publisher=BBC |date=24 January 2006 |access-date=6 September 2010}}</ref> [[Birds of prey]] include the [[merlin (bird)|merlin]], [[hen harrier]] and the [[red kite]], a national symbol of Welsh wildlife.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/news/details.asp?view=print&id=tcm:9-176206 |title=Red kite voted Wales' Favourite Bird |publisher=[[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] |date=11 October 2007 |access-date=6 September 2010 |archive-date=23 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823014457/http://www.rspb.org.uk/news/details.asp?view=print&id=tcm:9-176206 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In total, more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the [[RSPB]] reserve at [[Conwy]], including seasonal visitors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves/guide/c/conwy/about.aspx |title=About Conwy |publisher=RSPB.org.uk |date=16 April 2010 |access-date=6 September 2010}}</ref> Larger mammals, including brown bears, wolves and wildcats, died out during the Norman period.

The waters of south-west Wales of Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals, including [[basking sharks]], Atlantic [[grey seal]]s, leatherback turtles, dolphins, [[porpoises]], jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, in particular, are recognised as an area of international importance for [[bottlenose dolphin]]s, and [[New Quay]] has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins in the whole of the UK. River fish of note include [[Salvelinus|char]], eel, [[salmon]], [[shad]], [[sparling]] and [[Arctic char]], while the [[gwyniad]] is unique to Wales, found only in [[Bala Lake]].

The population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts, especially [[Glamorganshire]], which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911.<ref>Brian R. Mitchell and Phyllis Deane,  ''Abstract of British Historical Statistics'' (Cambridge, 1962) pp 20, 22</ref> Part of this increase can be attributed to the [[demographic transition]] seen in most industrialising countries during the [[Industrial Revolution in Wales|Industrial Revolution]], as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady. However, there was also large-scale migration into Wales during the Industrial Revolution.

Wales has one of the oldest unbroken literary traditions in Europe<ref name="Davies464">Davies (2008) p. 464</ref> going back to the sixth century and including [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] and [[Gerald of Wales]], regarded as among the finest Latin authors of the Middle Ages.<ref name="Davies464" /> The earliest body of Welsh verse, by poets [[Taliesin]] and [[Aneirin]], survive not in their original form, but in much-changed, medieval versions.<ref name="Davies464" /> Welsh poetry and native lore and learning survived through the era of the [[Medieval Welsh literature#Poets of the Princes (c. 1100 – c. 1300)|Poets of the Princes]] ({{circa|1100}}–1280) and then the [[Medieval Welsh literature#Poets of the Nobility, or Cywyddwyr (c. 1300 – c. 1600)|Poets of the Gentry]] ({{circa|1350}}–1650). The former were professional poets who composed eulogies and elegies to their patrons while the latter favoured the [[cywydd]] metre.<ref name="Davies688-9">Davies (2008) pp. 688–689</ref> The period produced one of Wales's greatest poets, [[Dafydd ap Gwilym]].<ref>Davies (2008) p. 191</ref> After the Anglicisation of the gentry the tradition declined.<ref name="Davies688-9" />

Despite the extinction of the professional poet, the integration of the native elite into a wider cultural world did bring other literary benefits.<ref name="Davies465">Davies (2008) p. 465</ref> Renaissance scholars such as [[William Salesbury]] and [[John Davies (Mallwyd)|John Davies]] brought [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] ideals from English universities.<ref name="Davies465" /> In 1588 [[William Morgan (Bible translator)|William Morgan]] became the first person to translate the [[Welsh Bible|Bible into Welsh]].<ref name="Davies465" /> From the 16th century the proliferation of the 'free-metre' verse became the most important development in Welsh poetry, but from the middle of the 17th century a host of imported accentual metres from England became very popular.<ref name="Davies465" /> By the 19th century the creation of a Welsh epic, fuelled by the eisteddfod, became an obsession with Welsh-language writers.<ref name="Davies466">Davies (2008) p. 466</ref> The output of this period was prolific in quantity but unequal in quality.<ref name="Williams121">{{Cite book |last=Williams |first=David |title=A Short History of Modern Wales |publisher=John Murray |year=1961 |location=London |page=121}}</ref> Initially excluded, religious denominations came to dominate the competitions, with bardic themes becoming scriptural and didactic.<ref name="Williams121" />

Developments in 19th-century Welsh literature include [[Lady Charlotte Guest]]'s translation into English of the Mabinogion, one of the most important medieval Welsh prose works of Celtic mythology. 1885 saw the publication of ''[[Rhys Lewis (novel)|Rhys Lewis]]'' by [[Daniel Owen]], credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century saw a move from the verbose Victorian Welsh style, with works such as [[Thomas Gwynn Jones]]'s ''[[Ymadawiad Arthur]]''.<ref name="Davies466" /> The First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style championed by [[T. H. Parry-Williams]] and [[R. Williams Parry]].<ref name="Davies466" /> The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of [[Rhydwen Williams]] who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. The inter-war period is dominated by [[Saunders Lewis]], for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism.<ref name="Davies466" />

The careers of some 1930s writers continued after World War Two, including those of [[Gwyn Thomas (novelist)|Gwyn Thomas]], [[Vernon Watkins]], and [[Dylan Thomas]], whose most famous work ''[[Under Milk Wood]]'' was first broadcast in 1954. Thomas was one of the most notable and popular Welsh writers of the 20th century and one of the most innovative poets of his time.<ref>Davies (2008) p. 861</ref> The attitude of the post-war generation of Welsh writers in English towards Wales differs from the previous generation, with greater sympathy for Welsh nationalism and the Welsh language. The change is linked to the nationalism of [[Saunders Lewis]] and the burning of the Bombing School on the [[Llŷn Peninsula]] in 1936.<ref>''The Pocket Guide'', p. 122.</ref> In poetry [[R. S. Thomas]] (1913–2000) was the most important figure throughout the second half of the 20th century. He "did not learn the Welsh language until he was 30 and wrote all his poems in English".<ref>''Los Angeles Times'', "Obituary", 27 September 2000</ref> Major writers in the second half of the 20th century include [[Emyr Humphreys]] (1919–2020), who during his long writing career published over twenty novels,<ref>''Emyr Humphreys: Conversations and Reflections'', ed.

Some Welsh artists of the 16th–18th centuries tended to leave the country to work, moving to London or Italy. [[Richard Wilson (painter)|Richard Wilson]] (1714–1782) is arguably the first major British landscapist; although more notable for his Italian scenes, he painted several Welsh scenes on visits from London. By the late 18th century, the popularity of [[landscape art]] grew and clients were found in the larger Welsh towns, allowing more Welsh artists to stay in their homeland. Artists from outside Wales were also drawn to paint Welsh scenery, at first because of the [[Celtic Revival]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=NMOW, Art in 18th Century Britain |url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/2249/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125090402/http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/2249/ |archive-date=25 January 2010 |access-date=22 June 2010 |publisher=[[National Museum Wales|Amgueddfa Cymru – Museum Wales]]}}; {{Cite web |title=NMOW, Welsh Artists of the 18th Century |url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/2261/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125090429/http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/2261/ |archive-date=25 January 2010 |access-date=19 June 2010 |publisher=[[National Museum Wales|Amgueddfa Cymru – Museum Wales]]}}</ref>

Welsh painters gravitated towards the art capitals of Europe. [[Augustus John]] and his sister [[Gwen John]] lived mostly in London and Paris. However, the landscapists Sir [[Kyffin Williams]] and [[Peter Prendergast (artist)|Peter Prendergast]] lived in Wales for most of their lives, while remaining in touch with the wider art world.
