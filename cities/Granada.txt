The identification of present-day Granada with the Roman-era ''Iliberis'' and the historical continuity between the two settlements has long been debated by scholars.<ref name=":0522">{{Cite book|last=García-Arenal|first=Mercedes|title=Encyclopaedia of Islam, Three|publisher=Brill|year=2014|editor-last=Fleet|editor-first=Kate|location=|pages=|chapter=|issn=1873-9830|quote=During the Roman period, there was a township named Iliberris on the slopes of the Sierra de Elvira, where archaeological remains of Roman, Visigothic, and Arab origin have been found. The existence of a Roman settlement in the same place as Granada—or rather, the identification of Granada with Iliberis—has been a bone of contention among historians of Granada since the 10th century. In the era of the so-called Christian "reconquest" of southern Spain, the notion of such continuity allowed the conquerors to speak of a “restoration” of Christianity in Granada. Some experts argue strongly for continuity between the Roman city and Granada, as against the possibility (supported by the Arabic sources) that Granada was, in fact, a Muslim foundation: archaeological evidence has not been decisive either way.|editor-last2=Krämer|editor-first2=Gudrun|editor-last3=Matringe|editor-first3=Denis|editor-last4=Nawas|editor-first4=John|editor-last5=Rowson|editor-first5=Everett}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=Carvajal López|first=José C.|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MureDwAAQBAJ&dq=%22Medina+Elvira%22&pg=PT526|title=The Routledge Handbook of Muslim Iberia|publisher=Routledge|year=2020|isbn=978-1-317-23354-1|editor-last=Fierro|editor-first=Maribel|pages=490, 505 (see note 18)|language=en|chapter=Material culture|quote=The location of the town of Ilbīra was a burning issue in Granada since the 16th century. The Catholic propaganda after 1492 pushed the identification of Ilbīra with Granada, and also with the Roman municipium Illiberis, where the first Church Council of Iberia took place in the early 4th century. If Granada was indeed Illiberis, the town was associated with one important early Christian centre and the right of the kings of Spain to take it over was providentially justified. However, there were enough mentions in the written sources, not only in Arabic, and even material evidence that suggested that Ilbīra, the first Islamic capital, was located near the village of Atarfe, about 15 kilometres north-west of Granada. The similarity in names suggested that Illiberis had been in Ilbīra and that Granada was a town founded by Muslims, ideas which implicitly supported the notion that Islam was an integral part of Spain rather than merely an enemy against which the nation had been built. After a debate four centuries long, M. Gómez Moreno compiled cases of the material evidence collected around the area of Atarfe by spoilers and even undertook an excavation in 1872 in which he found the mosque of the town, finally proving without any doubt that Ilbīra was located there. [p. 490] (...) See Gómez Moreno, Medina Elvira for the description of the debate and of the different interventions. It is interesting to note that this solves the question of the location of Ilbīra, but not of Illiberis, at least in the time of the Council. Excavations in Granada have uncovered strong evidence that suggests that the Iberian and Roman towns of the same name were located there (e.g. Sotomayor Muro, “¿Donde estuvo Iliberri?”). It seems that at some point in late Antiquity, possibly before the Islamic conquest, the town of Illiberis was moved to the location where it later became Madīna Ilbīrah (e.g. Adroher et al., “Discusión”, pp. 202–206). To a certain extent, the debate still continues.

It may have taken place in the former Roman town or it may have taken place somewhere in the surrounding region, which was known as Elvira.{{Sfn|Rodgers|Cavendish|2021|pp=6–10}}

===Founding and early history===
The [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]], starting in 711{{nbsp}}AD, brought large parts of the Iberian Peninsula under Moorish control and established [[al-Andalus]]. The earliest Arabic historical sources mention that a town named ''Qashtīliya'', later known as ''Madīnat Ilbīra'' (Elvira), was located on the southern slopes of the Sierra de Elvira mountains (near present-day [[Atarfe]]) and became the most important settlement in the area.<ref name=":2" />{{Sfn|Rodgers|Cavendish|2021|pp=6–10}} A smaller settlement and fortress (''ḥiṣn'') named ''Ġarnāṭa'' (also transliterated as ''Gharnāṭa)'' existed on the south side of the Darro River or on the site of the current Albaicín neighbourhood. The latter had a mainly [[Jews|Jewish]] population and thus was also known as ''Gharnāṭat al-Yahūd'' ("''Gharnāṭa'' of the Jews").<ref name=":05222" />{{Sfn|Rodgers|Cavendish|2021|pp=6–10}} The district around the city was known as ''[[Kura (al-Andalus)#Kūra of Elvira|Kūrat Ilbīra]]'' (roughly "Province of Elvira"). After 743 the town of ''Ilbīra'' was settled by soldiers from the region of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] who played a role in supporting [[Abd al-Rahman I]], the founder of the [[Emirate of Córdoba]] and a new [[Umayyad dynasty|Umayyad]] dynasty.<ref name=":05222" /> In the late 9th century, during the reign of [[Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi|Abdallah]] (r. 844–912), the city and its surrounding district were the site of conflict between ''[[muwallad]]''s (Muslim converts) who were loyal to the central government and Arabs, led by Sawwār ibn Ḥamdūn, who resented them.<ref name=":05222" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marín Guzmán|first=Roberto|date=1993|title=Social and Ethnic Tensions in al-Andalus: Cases of Ishbīliyah (Sevilla) 276/889–302/914 and Ilbīrah (Elvira) 276/889–284/897: The Role of 'Umar Ibn Ḥafṣūn|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20840132|journal=Islamic Studies|volume=32|issue=3|pages=279–318|jstor=20840132}}</ref>

At the beginning of the 11th century, the area became dominated by the Zirids, a [[Sanhaja]] [[Berbers|Berber]] group and offshoot of the [[Zirid dynasty|Zirids]] who ruled parts of [[North Africa]]. This group became an important contingent in the army of [[Abd al-Malik al-Muzaffar|ʿAbd al-Malik al-Muẓaffar]], the prime minister of Caliph [[Hisham II]] (r. 976–1009) and successor to [[Almanzor|Ibn Abi ʿAmir al-Mansur]] (Almanzor) as ''de facto'' ruler of the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]]. For their service, the Zirids were granted control of the province of Elvira.<ref name=":05222" /> When the Caliphate collapsed after 1009 and the [[Fitna of al-Andalus|Fitna (civil war)]] began, the Zirid leader [[Zawi ben Ziri]] established an independent kingdom for himself, the [[Taifa of Granada]]. Arab sources such as [[Muhammad al-Idrisi|al-Idrisi]] consider him to be the founder of the city of Granada.<ref name=":05222" /> His surviving memoirs – the only ones for the Spanish "Middle Ages" – provide considerable detail for this brief period.<ref name=":3">{{cite book

[[File:PuertaMonaita.JPG|thumb|Puerta Monaita, one of the 11th-century Zirid gates in the [[Albaicín|Albaicin]]]]
The Zirids built their citadel and palace, known as the ''al-Qaṣaba al-Qadīma'' ("Old Citadel"), on the hill now occupied by the Albaicín neighborhood.<ref name=":05222" /><ref name=":24" /> It was connected to two smaller fortresses on the Sabika hill (site of the future Alhambra) and Mauror hill to the south.<ref name=":24" /> The city around it grew during the 11th century to include the Albaicín, the Sabika, the Mauror, and a part of the surrounding plains.

Under the Zirid kings [[Habbus al-Muzaffar|Habbus ibn Maksan]] and [[Badis ibn Habus|Badis]], the most powerful figure was the Jewish administrator known as [[Samuel ibn Naghrillah|Samuel ha-Nagid]] (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]) or Isma'il ibn Nagrilla (in Arabic). Samuel was a highly educated member of the former elites of Cordoba, who fled that city after the outbreak of the Fitna. He eventually found his way to Granada, where Habbus ibn Maksan appointed him his secretary in 1020 and entrusted him with many important responsibilities, including tax collection. Under Badis, he even took charge of the army.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|last=Catlos|first=Brian A.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xKBfDwAAQBAJ&dq=kingdoms+of+faith&pg=PP1|title=Kingdoms of Faith: A New History of Islamic Spain|publisher=Basic Books|year=2018|isbn=978-0465055876|location=New York|pages=216–220}}</ref> During this period, the Muslim king was looked upon as a mainly symbolic figurehead. Granada was the center of Jewish Sephardi culture and scholarship. According to Daniel Eisenberg:

{{blockquote|Granada was in the eleventh century the center of Sephardic civilization at its peak, and from 1027 until 1066 Granada was a powerful Jewish state. Jews did not hold the foreigner ([[dhimmi]]) status typical of Islamic rule. Samuel ibn Nagrilla, recognized by Sephardic Jews everywhere as the quasi-political ha-Nagid ('The Prince'), was king in all but name. As vizier he made policy and—much more unusual—led the army. [...] It is said that Samuel's strengthening and fortification of Granada was what permitted it, later, to survive as the last Islamic state in the Iberian peninsula. All of the greatest figures of eleventh-century Hispano-Jewish culture are associated with Granada. [[Moses Ibn Ezra]] was from Granada; on his invitation [[Judah ha-Levi]] spent several years there as his guest. [[Ibn Gabirol]]’s patrons and hosts were the Jewish [[vizier]]s of Granada, Samuel ha-Nagid and his son Joseph.<ref>{{cite book

From the late 11th century to the early 13th century, Al-Andalus was dominated by two successive North African Berber empires. The [[Almoravids]] ruled Granada from 1090 and the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohads]] from 1166.{{sfn|Hourihane|2012}} Granada also served as an administrative capital of Almoravid rule in al-Andalus.{{Sfn|Kennedy|1996|p=172}} Evidence from the artistic and archeological remains of this period suggest that the city thrived under the Almoravids but declined under the Almohads.<ref name=":24" /> Remnants of the Almohad period in the city include the [[Alcázar Genil]], built in 1218–1219 (but later redecorated under the Nasrids),{{Sfn|Arnold|2017|p=240–241}} and possibly the former minaret attached to the present-day Church of San Juan de los Reyes in the Albaicin.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Orihuela|first1=Antonio|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qsOwCQAAQBAJ&dq=San+Juan+de+los+Reyes+Granada+almohad&pg=PA189|title=Revisiting al-Andalus: Perspectives on the Material Culture of Islamic Iberia and Beyond|last2=Rosser-Owen|first2=Mariam|publisher=Brill|year=2007|isbn=978-90-474-2206-8|editor-last=Anderson|editor-first=Glaire D.|pages=189|language=en|chapter=The Andalusi House in Granada: Thirteenth to Sixteenth Centuries|editor-last2=Rosser-Owen|editor-first2=Mariam}}</ref>{{Efn|This minaret is attributed to the 13th century by most sources,<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last1=Barrucand|first1=Marianne|title=Moorish architecture in Andalusia|last2=Bednorz|first2=Achim|publisher=Taschen|year=1992|isbn=3822876348|pages=112}}</ref><ref name=":24" /> but at least some sources, such as the ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture'', attribute it to the Nasrid period of this century.<ref name=":24" />}}

===Nasrid Emirate of Granada===
{{Main|Emirate of Granada}}
[[File:CoA Nasrid kings Alhambra Granada Spain.jpg|thumb|Sigil of the [[Nasrid dynasty]] located in the Palacio de Comares]]
In 1228 [[Idris al-Ma'mun]], the last effective [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] ruler in al-Andalus, left the Iberian Peninsula. As Almohad rule collapsed local leaders and factions emerged across the region. With the ''[[Reconquista]]'' in full swing, the Christian kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] – under kings [[Ferdinand III of Castile|Ferdinand III]] and [[James I of Aragon|James I]], respectively – made major conquests across al-Andalus. Castile captured [[Siege of Córdoba (1236)|Cordoba in 1236]] and [[Siege of Seville|Seville in 1248]]. Meanwhile, the ambitious [[Muhammad I of Granada|Ibn al-Ahmar]] (Muhammad I) established what became the last and longest reigning [[Muslim]] dynasty in the Iberian peninsula, the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrids]], who ruled the [[Emirate of Granada]]. On multiple occasions Ibn al-Ahmar aligned himself with Ferdinand III, eventually agreeing to become his vassal in 1246.{{Sfn|Kennedy|1996|p=276}} Granada thereafter became a [[tributary state]] to the Kingdom of Castile, although this was often interrupted by wars between the two states.{{Sfn|Kennedy|1996}}<ref name=":05222" /> The political history of the emirate was turbulent and intertwined with that of its neighbours. The Nasrids sometimes provided refuge or military aid to Castilian kings and noblemen, even against other Muslim states, while in turn the Castilians provided refuge and aid to some Nasrid emirs against other Nasrid rivals. On other occasions the Nasrids attempted to leverage the aid of the North African [[Marinid Sultanate|Marinids]] to ward off Castile, although Marinid interventions in the Peninsula ended after [[Battle of Río Salado|Battle of Rio Salado]] (1340).{{Sfn|Kennedy|1996}}<ref name=":8">{{cite book|last=Bosworth|first=Clifford Edmund|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKpz_2CkoWEC&q=new+islamic+dynasties|title=The New Islamic Dynasties: A Chronological and Genealogical Manual|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0748696482|location=|pages=|chapter=The Nasrids or Banu 'l-Ahmar}}</ref><ref name=":05222" />

=== End of Muslim rule and 16th-century changes ===
[[File:La Rendición de Granada - Pradilla.jpg|thumb|''[[The Surrender of Granada]]'' by F. Padilla: [[Muhammad XII of Granada|Muhammad{{nbsp}}XII]] before [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella I]] (circa 1882)]]
On 2 January 1492, the last Muslim ruler in Iberia, Emir [[Muhammad XII of Granada|Muhammad XII]], known as "Boabdil" to the Spanish, surrendered complete control of the [[Emirate of Granada]] to the [[Catholic Monarchs]] ([[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]]), after the last episode of the [[Granada War]].

The 1492 capitulation of the Kingdom of Granada to the Catholic Monarchs is one of the most significant events in Granada's history. It brought the demise of the last Muslim-controlled polity in the Iberian Peninsula. The terms of the surrender, outlined in the [[Treaty of Granada (1491)|Treaty of Granada]] at the end of 1491, explicitly allowed the Muslim inhabitants, known as ''[[mudéjar]]es'', to continue unmolested in the practice of their faith and customs. This had been a traditional practice during Castilian (and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]]) conquests of Muslim cities since the takeover of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in the 11th century.{{Sfn|Coleman|2013|p=36}} The terms of the surrender pressured Jewish inhabitants to convert or leave within three years,{{Sfn|Harvey|1990|p=321}} but this provision was quickly superseded by the [[Alhambra Decree]], issued only a few months later on March 31, which instead forced all Jews in Spain to convert or be expelled within four months.{{Sfn|Coleman|2013|p=38}}<ref>{{Cite book|last=O'Callaghan|first=Joseph F.|title=The Last Crusade in the West: Castile and the Conquest of Granada|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0812245875|pages=244}}</ref> Those who converted became known as ''[[converso]]s'' (converts). This move, along with the progressive erosion of other guarantees provided by the surrender treaty, raised tensions and fears within the remaining Muslim community during the 1490s.{{Sfn|Coleman|2013|pp=37–38}} Many of the city's affluent Muslims and its traditional ruling classes emigrated to North Africa in the early years after the conquest, but these early emigrants numbered only a few thousand, with the rest of the population unable to afford leaving.{{Sfn|Coleman|2013|p=38}}{{efn|Boabdil, for example, exiled from [[Adra, Spain|Adra]] to [[Cazaza]] to establish in [[Fes]].}}

By 1499, Cardinal [[Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros]] grew frustrated with the slow pace of the efforts of the first [[Archbishopric of Granada|archbishop of Granada]], [[Hernando de Talavera]], to convert non-Christians and undertook a program of forced [[baptism]]s, creating the ''converso'' class for Muslims and Jews. Cisneros's new strategy, which was a direct violation of the terms of the treaty, provoked the [[Rebellion of the Alpujarras (1499–1501)|Rebellion of the Alpujarras]] (1499–1501) centered in the rural [[Alpujarras]] region southeast of the city. The rebellion lasted until 1500 in Granada and continued until 1501 in the Alpujarras.{{Sfn|Coleman|2013|p=43}} Responding to the rebellion of 1501, the [[Crown of Castile]] rescinded the Treaty of Granada,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Henry Charles |title=The Moriscos of Spain; their conversion and expulsion |date=1901 |publisher=Lea Brothers and Company |location=Philadelphia |page=35 |url=https://archive.org/details/moriscosspainth01leagoog/page/n54/mode/2up}}</ref> and mandated that Granada's Muslims convert or emigrate. Many of the remaining Muslim elites subsequently emigrated to North Africa. The majority of the Granada's ''mudéjares'' converted (becoming the so-called ''[[morisco]]s'' or Moorish) so that they could stay. Both populations of converts were subject to persecution, execution, or exile, and each had cells that practiced their original religion in secrecy (the so-called ''[[marranos]]'' in the case of the ''conversos'' accused of the charge of [[crypto-Judaism]]).

[[File:Braun Granada HAAB.jpg|thumb|right|16th-century view of the city, as depicted in [[Georg Braun]]'s ''Civitates orbis terrarum'']]
Over the course of the 16th century, Granada took on an ever more Catholic and Castilian character, as immigrants arrived from other regions of Castile, lured by the promise of economic opportunities in the newly conquered city.{{Sfn|Coleman|2013|p=15}} At the time of the city's surrender in 1492 it had a population of 50,000 which included only a handful of Christians (mostly captives), but by 1561 (the year of the first royal [[census]] of the city) the population was composed of over 30,000 Christian immigrants and approximately 15,000 ''moriscos''.{{Sfn|Coleman|2013|p=15}} After 1492 the city's first churches had been installed in some converted mosques.{{Efn|One early example is the conversion of the "Almoravid Mosque" (''Masjid al-Murabitun'') into the Church of San José in 1494, with the mosque's former minaret preserved today as the church's bell tower.<ref name=":6" />}} The vast majority of the city's remaining mosques were subsequently converted into churches during and after the mass conversions of 1500.{{Sfn|Coleman|2013|p=96-97}} In 1531, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] founded the [[University of Granada]] on the site of the former madrasa built by Yusuf I.<ref name=":5" />

Granada's Town Council did not fully establish until almost nine years after the Castilian conquest,{{Sfn|Peinado Santaella|2013|p=213}} upon the concession of the so-called 'Constitutive Charter' of the Ayuntamiento of Granada on 23 September 1500.{{Sfn|Peinado Santaella|2013|p=221}} From then on, the municipal institution became a crucible for the "[[Old Christian]]" and the converted ''morisco'' elites, resulting in strong factionalism, particularly after 1508.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=La oligarquía municipal de Granada en los albores del dominio castellano|first=Rafael Gerardo|last=Peinado Santaella|journal=Edad Media: Revista de Historia|issn=1138-9621|issue=14|year=2013|pages=213–214|url=https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/4203903.pdf}}</ref> The new period also saw the creation of a number of other new institutions such as the Cathedral Cabildo, the {{ill|Captaincy–General of Granada|es|Capitanía General de Granada|lt=Captaincy–General}}, the Royal Chapel and the [[Royal Chancellery of Granada|Royal Chancellery]].{{Sfn|Peinado Santaella|2013|p=214}} For the rest of the 16th century the Granadan ruling oligarchy featured roughly a 40% of (Jewish) ''conversos'' and about a 31% of ''[[Hidalgo (nobility)|hidalgo]]s''.{{Sfn|Peinado Santaella|2013|p=215}} From the 1520s onward, the mosque structures themselves began to be replaced with new church buildings, a process which continued for most of the century.{{Sfn|Coleman|2013|pp=96–97}} In December 1568, during a period of renewed persecution against ''moriscos'', the [[Rebellion of the Alpujarras (1568–1571)|Second Morisco Rebellion]] broke out in the Alpujarras.{{Sfn|Coleman|2013|p=7-8}} Although the city's ''morisco'' population played little role in the rebellion, King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] ordered the expulsion of the vast majority of the ''morisco'' population from the [[Kingdom of Granada (Crown of Castile)|Kingdom of Granada]], with the exception of those artisans and professionals judged essential to the economy. The expelled population was redistributed to other cities throughout the Crown of Castile. The [[Expulsion of the Moriscos|final expulsion]] of all ''moriscos'' from Castile and Aragon was carried out between 1609 and 1614.{{Sfn|Coleman|2013|pp=7–8}}

In the 1930s the tensions that eventually divided Spain were evident in Granada, with frequent riots and friction between landowners and peasants.

The city of Granada sits on the [[Vega de Granada]], one of the depressions or plains located within the [[Baetic System|Baetic mountain ranges]], continued to the west by those of Archidona and [[Hoya of Antequera|Antequera]] and to the East by those of [[Hoya of Guadix|Guadix]], [[Hoya of Baza|Baza]] and Huéscar.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Menor Toribio|title=Transformaciones recientes en la organización territorial de la Vega de Granada: del espacio agrario tradicional a la aglomeración urbana actual|journal=Estudios Regionales|issue=48|year=1997|issn=0213-7585|pages=190–191}}</ref>

The fertile soil of the Vega, apt for agriculture, is irrigated by the water streams originated in [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]], as well as minor secondary ranges, all drained by the catchment basin of the [[Genil River]],{{Sfn|Menor Toribio|1997|p=192}} that cuts across the city centre following an east to west direction. The [[Monachil (river)|Monachil]], a left-bank tributary of the former, also passes through the city, discharging into the Genil to the west of the city centre.

===Climate===
Granada has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa'') close to a cold [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSk''). Summers are hot and dry with daily temperatures averaging {{cvt|34|°C}} in the hottest month (July); however, temperatures reaching over {{cvt|40|°C}} are not uncommon in the summer months. Winters are cool and damp, with most of the rainfall concentrated from November through to January. The coldest month is January with daytime temperatures hovering at {{cvt|13|°C|0}} and dropping to around {{cvt|1|°C}} during the night. Frost is common as temperatures usually reach below-freezing in the early morning. Snow is rare and occurs once every few years. Spring and autumn are unpredictable, with temperatures ranging from mild to warm. Early summer in 2017 confronted the city with two massive heat waves that broke long-standing record temperatures starting on June 13, 2017, with a new maximum high for the month at 40.6&nbsp;°C (old record 40.0), which was topped three times within the span of four days at 40.9&nbsp;°C on June 14, 41.3 (June 15) and, eventually, 41.5 (June 17). The second extreme surge in temperatures followed roughly a month later when readings soared to 45.7 and 45.3&nbsp;°C on July 12 and 13, respectively, surpassing the old July record by almost 3 degrees.

== Politics and administration ==
{{More citations needed|section|date=February 2022}}

=== Metropolitan area of Granada ===
Granada's metropolitan area consists of about fifty municipalities and the capital. Although it is not formally constituted as a political and administrative body, there are several public services that are combined. The arrival of many inhabitants of the capital and other towns in the province, influences a large [[population growth]]. Despite the fact that the capital loses inhabitants, who move to neighboring towns. The main causes of the exodus towards the towns of the metropolitan area are, mainly, the difficulty of accessing a home in the capital because of the high prices it has and labor reasons, because in the towns of the periphery the majority are being located of industrial estates.

=== Capital of Granada Province ===
The city of Granada is the capital of the province of the same name, thus all administrative entities of provincial scope dependent on the regional government and the state are located there. There is a provincial delegation from each of the governmental departments to the [[Regional Government of Andalusia|Junta de Andalucía]], coordinated by a government delegate under the Ministry of the Interior. [[Government of Spain|The national government of Spain]] has a [[Government Delegation (Spain)|sub-delegation]] in Granada, subordinate to the government delegate in the autonomous community.

=== Judicial administration ===
The headquarters of the Superior Court of Justice of Andalusia, [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] is in Granada, located in Plaza Nueva, in the building of the historic [[High Court of Justice of Andalusia|Royal Chancery]], as well as the Superior Prosecutor's Office of Andalusia, located in the building of the Bank of Spain. It has a Provincial Court, located in Corteza del Carmen Street, and is also head of the Judicial Party No. 3 of the province, whose demarcation includes the city and 49 towns, some of them very populated, in the metropolitan area region.

Most of the courts are located in two administrative buildings, in Plaza Nueva and Avenida del Sur. The set of judicial bodies is as follows:

* Superior Court of Justice: President. Civil-Criminal Chamber. Contentious-Administrative Room. Social room.
* Provincial Court: President. Criminal: 2; Civil: 3.
* Courts

===Realejo===
Realejo was the Jewish district in the time of the Nasrid Granada.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} (The centuries since the Jewish population were so important that Granada was known in Al-Andalus under the name of "Granada of the Jews", {{langx|ar|غرناطة اليهود}} ''Gharnāṭah al-Yahūd''.) It is today a district made up of many Granadinian villas, with gardens opening onto the streets, called ''Los Cármenes''.

===Cartuja===
This district contains the Carthusian monastery of the same name: Cartuja. This is an old monastery started in a late Gothic style with Baroque exuberant interior decorations. In this district also, many buildings were created with the extension of the [[University of Granada]].

===Bib-Rambla===
The toponym derives from a gate (Bab al-Ramla, or the [[Gate of the Ears]]) that was built when Granada was controlled by the [[Nasrid dynasty]]. Nowadays, Bib-Rambla is a high point for gastronomy, especially in its terraces of restaurants, open on beautiful days. The Arab [[bazaar]], the ''[[Alcaicería of Granada|Alcaicería]]'', is made up of several narrow streets, which start from this place and continue as far as the cathedral.

===Sacromonte===
{{Main|Sacromonte}}
The Sacromonte neighborhood is located on the extension of the hill of Albaicín, along the Darro River. This area, which became famous by the nineteenth century for its predominantly [[Gitanos|Gitano]] inhabitants, is characterized by cave houses, which are dug into the hillside. The area has a reputation as a major center of flamenco song and dance, including the [[Zambra|''Zambra Gitana'']], an Andalusian dance originating in the Middle East. The zone is a protected cultural environment under the auspices of the ''Centro de Interpretación del Sacromonte'', a cultural center dedicated to the preservation of Gitano cultural forms.

===Zaidín===
{{Main|Zaidín (Granada)}}
This formerly blue collar but now upmarket neighborhood houses 100,000 residents of Granada, making it the largest neighborhood or 'barrio'. Traditionally populated by [[Gitanos|Romani]] people, now many residents are from North and West Africa, China, and many South American countries. Every Saturday morning it hosts a large outdoor market or "mercadillo", where many people come and sell their wares of fruits and vegetables, clothes and shoes, and other bits and bobs.

The Alhambra is a fortified palace complex located on the Sabika hill, an outcrop of the Sierra Nevada which overlooks the city of Granada.

After the conclusion of the ''Reconquista'' in 1492, the site became the Royal Court of Ferdinand and Isabella (where [[Christopher Columbus]] received royal endorsement for his expedition), and the palaces were partially altered. In 1526, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] commissioned a new Renaissance-style palace, now known as the [[Palace of Charles V]], in direct juxtaposition with the Nasrid palaces, but it was left uncompleted in the early 17th century.{{Sfn|López|2011|pp=65–70}} Other notable Renaissance additions from the reign of Charles{{nbsp}}V include the Emperor's Chambers and the ''Peinador de la Reina'' ('Queen's Robing Room'), which are connected to the former Nasrid Palaces.{{Sfn|López|2011|p=149-159}}

{{Main|Generalife}}
[[File:Patio de la Acequia (Generalife) - DSC07863 (slightly cropped and sharpened).jpg|alt=|thumb|294x294px|The Generalife Palace]]
The [[Generalife]] is a Nasrid-era country estate or summer palace located just east of the Alhambra, on a sloping site above it. It was first built by [[Muhammad II of Granada|Muhammad II]] and [[Muhammad III of Granada|Muhammad III]] in the late 13th and early 14th centuries.{{Sfn|Ruggles|2000|pp=155–156}}{{Sfn|Arnold|2017|p=257}} This palace features several rectangular garden courtyards with decorated pavilions at either end and it was originally linked to the Alhambra by a walled corridor that crosses the valley between the two.

The Generalife also underwent major alterations by Christian Spanish builders in the 16th century, which imparted Renaissance elements on the palace.{{Sfn|López|2011|pp=219–237}} In the 20th century a large area of modern landscaped gardens, known as the ''Jardines Nuevos'' ('New Gardens'), were added to the south of the Nasrid palace and form the main approach to it today.

====Cathedral====
{{Main|Cathedral of Granada}}
[[File:Spain Andalusia Granada BW 2015-10-25 13-20-43.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Cathedral of Granada]], south portal]]
The [[cathedral]] of Granada is built over the Nasrid Great [[Mosque]] of Granada, in the centre of the city. Its construction began during the [[Spanish Renaissance]] in the early 16th century, shortly after the [[Granada War|conquest of Granada]] by the [[Catholic Monarchs]], who commissioned the works to [[Juan Gil de Hontañón]] and Enrique Egas. Numerous grand buildings were built in the reign of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], so that the cathedral is contemporary to the [[Palace of Charles V|Christian palace of the Alhambra]], the [[University of Granada|University]] and the Real Chancillería (Supreme Court).

The church was conceived on the model of the [[Cathedral of Toledo]], for what initially was a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] architectural project, as was customary in Spain in the early decades of the 16th century. However, Egas was relieved by the Catholic hierarchy in 1529, and the continuation of the work was assigned to [[Diego Siloe]], who built upon the example of his predecessor, but changed the approach towards a fully Renaissance aesthetic.<ref>Jerez Mir, Carlos: ''Architecture guide of Granada'', Ministry of Culture of Andalusia, pág. 59, {{ISBN|84-921824-0-7}}</ref>

The architect drew new Renaissance lines for the whole building over the gothic foundations, with an ambulatory and five naves instead of the usual three. Over time, the bishopric continued to commission new architectural projects of importance, such as the redesign of the main façade, undertaken in 1664 by [[Alonso Cano]] (1601–1667) to introduce Baroque elements. In 1706 Francisco de Hurtado Izquierdo and later his collaborator José Bada built the current tabernacle of the cathedral.

Highlights of the church's components include the main [[chapel]], where may be found the praying statues of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], which consists of a series of [[Corinthian order|Corinthian columns]] with the [[entablature]] resting on their [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], and the [[vault (architecture)|vault]] over all. The spaces of the walls between the columns are perforated by a series of windows. The design of the [[Church tabernacle|tabernacle]] of 1706 preserves the classic proportions of the church, with its multiple columns crossing the forms of Diego de Siloé.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moebius.es/ggranada/monu/catedral.htm |title=Guide of Monuments of Granada: Cathedral |publisher=Moebius.es |access-date=2011-03-11}}</ref>

====Royal Chapel====
{{Main|Royal Chapel of Granada}}
[[File:Granada Cathedral rear (8169710093).jpg|thumb|[[Isabelline (architectural style)|Isabelline-Gothic]] [[Royal Chapel of Granada]]]]

The [[Catholic Monarchs]] chose the city of Granada as their burial site by a royal decree dated September 13, 1504. The Royal Chapel of Granada, built over the former terrace of the Great Mosque, ranks with other important Granadan buildings such as the Lonja and the Catedral e Iglesia del Sagrario. In it are buried the [[Catholic Monarchs]], their daughter [[Joanna of Castile]] (''Juana la Loca'') and her husband [[Philip I of Castile|Felipe I]] (''Felipe el Hermoso''). Construction of the Chapel started in 1505, directed by its designer, Enrique Egas. Built in several stages, the continuing evolution of its design joined [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] construction and decoration with Renaissance ideals, as seen in the tombs and the 17th and 18th century Granadan art in the Chapel of Santa Cruz. Over the years the church acquired a treasury of works of art, liturgical objects and [[relic]]s.

The Royal Chapel was declared a [[Bien de Interés Cultural|Historic Artistic Monument]] on May 19, 1884, taking consideration of BIC ([[Bien de Interés Cultural]]) status in the current legislation of Spanish Historical Heritage (Law 16/1985 of 25 June). The most important parts of the chapel are its main [[retable]], grid and [[Vault (architecture)|vault]]. In the Sacristy-Museum is the legacy of the Catholic Monarchs. Its art gallery is highlighted by works of the Flemish, Italian and Spanish schools.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.capillarealgranada.com/es/historia.html |title=Royal Chapel of Granada.

====Sacromonte====
{{Main|Sacromonte}}
The Sacromonte neighbourhood is located on the Valparaíso hill, one of several hills that make up Granada. This neighborhood is known as the old neighbourhood of the [[Romani people|Romani]], who settled in Granada after the conquest of the city. It is one of the most picturesque neighborhoods, full of whitewashed caves cut into the rock and used as residences. The sound of strumming guitars may still be heard there in the performance of flamenco ''[[Flamenco#Cante (song)|cantes]]'' and ''quejíos'', so that over time it has become one of the most popular tourist attractions in Granada.

At the top of this hill is the Abbey of Sacromonte and the College of Sacromonte, founded in the 17th century by the then Archbishop of Granada [[Pedro de Castro, 1st Duke of la Conquista|Pedro de Castro]]. The Abbey of Sacromonte was built to monitor and guard the alleged relics of the evangelists of Baetica. Those are of questionable authenticity, but since their finding the area has been a religious pilgrimage destination.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guiasdegranada.com/index.php/Barrio-Sacromonte/54/0/ |title=History of the Sacromonte |publisher=Guiasdegranada.com |access-date=2011-03-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711132944/http://www.guiasdegranada.com/index.php/Barrio-Sacromonte/54/0/ |archive-date=2011-07-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The abbey complex consists of the catacombs, the abbey (17th–18th centuries), the Colegio Viejo de San Dionisio Areopagita (17th century) and the Colegio Nuevo (19th century). The interior of the church is simple and small but has numerous excellent works of art, which accentuate the size and rich carving of the ''Crucificado de Risueño'', an object of devotion for the Romani people, who sing and dance in the procession of Holy Week. The facilities also include a museum, which houses the works acquired by the Foundation.<ref>Hierro Calleja, Rafael – Granada y La Alhambra (The Sacromonte. Page 113) {{ISBN|84-7169-084-5}}</ref>

====Charterhouse====
{{Main|Granada Charterhouse}}
[[File:Cartuja de Granada Cupula del Sagrario.jpg|thumb|Tabernacle Dome, [[Granada Charterhouse]]]]
The Charterhouse of Granada is a monastery of cloistered monks, located in what was a farm or Muslim almunia called ''Aynadamar'' ("fountain of tears") that had an abundance of water and fruit trees. The initiative to build the monastery in that place was begun by [[Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba]], known as [[Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba|El Gran Capitán]]. The charterhouse was founded in 1506; construction started ten years later, and continued for the following 300 years.

The Monastery suffered heavy damage during the [[Peninsular War]] and lost considerable property in 1837 as a result of the [[Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendizábal|confiscations of Mendizábal]]. Currently, the monastery belongs to the [[Carthusian Order|Carthusians]], reporting directly to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Granada|Archdiocese of Granada]].<ref>Hierro Calleja, Rafael – Granada y la Alhambra (Charterhouse. Page 178) – Ediciones Miguel Sánchez {{ISBN|84-7169-084-5}}</ref>

The street entrance to the complex is an ornate arch of [[Plateresque]] style. Through it one reaches a large courtyard, at the end which is a wide staircase leading to the entrance of the church. The church, of early 16th century style and plan, has three entrances, one for the faithful and the other two for monks and clergy. Its plan has a single [[nave]] divided into four sections, highlighting the [[retable]]s of [[Juan Sánchez Cotán]] and the [[chancel]]'s glass doors, adorned with [[mother-of-pearl]], [[silver]], rare woods, and [[ivory]]. The [[Presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]] is covered by [[Ellipse|elliptical]] [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]]. The main altar, between the chancel arch and the [[church tabernacle]], is gilded wood.

The church's [[tabernacle]] and sancta sanctorum are considered a masterpiece of [[Baroque]] Spanish art in its blend of architecture, painting and sculpture. The dome that covers this area is decorated with frescoes by the Córdoba artist [[Antonio Palomino]] (18th century) representing the triumph of the Church Militant, faith, and religious life.

The courtyard, with galleries of arches on [[Doric order]] columns opening on it, is centered by a fountain. The Chapter House of Legos is the oldest building of the monastery (1517). It is rectangular and covered with groin vaulting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legadoandalusi.es/legado/contenido/rutas/museos/956.htm |title=History of the Charterhouse of Granada |publisher=Legadoandalusi.es |access-date=2011-03-11 |archive-date=2008-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924101253/http://www.legadoandalusi.es/legado/contenido/rutas/museos/956.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

'''<big>Mosque of Granada</big>'''

The Mosque of Granada was inaugurated in 2003 on the summit of the neighborhood of Albayzin. The mosque was built near the Church of San Salvador and the Church of San Nicolás. The Church of San Salvador was built on the site of the Great Mosque of Albayzin. The Society for the Return of Islam in Spain purchased the site in 1981, but it took many years for the plans to be approved. The mosque's initial funding was supplied by [[Shaykh Abdalqadir as-sufi al-Murabit|Shaykh 'Abdalqadir as-Sufi al-Murabit]] who envisioned providing Granada's new Spanish Muslim community with a mosque. Additional funding came from Malaysia, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. In 1991 the CIE (Comunidad Islámica en España) hired the architect Renato Ramirez Sanchez to design the mosque. In the 1990s, there was a heated debate pertaining to the design of the minaret. Construction eventually began in 2001. The mosque now serves about 500 people.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bush|first=Olga|date=2015|title=Entangled Gazes: The Polysemy of the New Great Mosque of Granada|journal=Muqarnas|volume=32|pages=97–134|doi=10.1163/22118993-00321P07}}</ref>

====Palace of the Marqués de Salar====
The '''Palace of the Marqués de Salar''' was built in one of the most emblematic streets of Granada, the '''Carrera del Darro''', at number 5. This place is an architectural example of the classical Granada during the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] transformation of the [[16th century|XVI<sup>th</sup> century]]. It was built by the Marqués de Salar, great-grandson of both Hernán Pérez del Pulgar (known by the name of ''El de la Hazañas'' [The One of the Valiant Deeds]) and [[Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba]] (''El Gran Capitán'' [The Great Captain]), Captain-General of the Castilian-Aragonese forces that concluded the Reconquest of the peninsula. The palace is now the museum of perfumes El Patio de los Perfumes, with {{convert|1500|sqm}} of floor space on two floors and {{convert|130|sqm}} of patio to relax surrounded by flowers and perfumes.

===Gastronomy===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2022}}
The [[gastronomy]] of Granada is part of the Arabic-Andalusian cuisine tradition, with a strong Arab and Jewish heritage, which is reflected in its condiments and spices, such as [[cumin]], [[coriander]], [[nutmeg]], cinnamon, raisins, almonds or honey. The writer Miguel Alcobendas, author of the ''traditional cuisine of Granada'', says that it has its origin in living together, from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century (when Granada surrendered to the [[Catholic Monarchs]]), of Muslims, Jews and Christians in the [[Nasrid Kingdom of Granada|Nasrid Kingdom]] from Granada. Subsequently, there was a miscegenation with the kitchen of the Christians, in which the pork acquired an importance in the kitchen of Granada more than in the rest of Spain, since its consumption allowed its eaters to demonstrate a certain distance from the persecuted religions, since [[Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork|both Muslims and Jews have it banned]].

The climatic differences of the different regions of the province, from the coast to the peaks of the [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] propitiates a great variety of raw materials: vegetables, meats and sausages, and fish that are combined in a multitude of dishes and recipes for soups and stews.

The famous and reputed Trevélez ham comes from the Sierra of Granada, to which other pork derivatives are added, sausages such as [[chorizo]], [[black pudding]] and pork tenderloin.

Ham and beans, two products of the land, are combined in one of its most typical dishes, beans with ham; Other known dishes are the Sacromonte tortilla, which among other ingredients must have cooked brains and veal crustaillas, chopped and sauteed before mixing with the egg. It is also worth mentioning "papas a lo pobre", potatoes which are usually served with egg and fried peppers, as well as with pieces of pork or ham.

Among the stews and potajes, the pot of San Antón stands out, which is eaten mainly towards the second half of January; cabbage stew, which combines vegetables and legumes; the stew of green beans and fennel; The thistle and pumpkin casserole, with noodles and aromatic herbs, or gypsy pottery are other dishes of the land.

[[Confectionery]] is well represented in the gastronomy of Granada, for sweets prepared by the nuns can be purchased in the numerous convents of the city: the ''pestiños'' of Vélez or those of the ''Encarnación'', the [[puff pastry|puff pastries]] of San Jerónimo, the ovos moles of San Antón, the Zafra biscuit, sweet potato rolls, ''cocas'', ''roscos'' from Santo Tomas and ''mantecados''. Aljojábanas, honey and cheese dumplings and some of the fritters called {{lang|es|almohados}}, as well as fig bread, Moorish ''roscos'' and an almond cake called ''soyá'' are all of Arabic heritage.

Unlike in other provinces of Andalusia, in Granada ''[[tapas]]'' (appetizers or snacks) are usually free in bars and restaurants. "Bar hopping" (''Ir de tapas'') and eating tapas in the time between finishing work and having dinner is a deeply rooted traditional activity among the people of Granada. There are different tapas routes around the city.

===Leisure and entertainment===

These flamenco shows, usually linked to restaurants, are one of the city's cultural attractions.
* Festivals. Granada has a very complete range of events: International Music and Dance Festival, International Jazz Festival, Granada Festival South Cinemas and International Tango Festival, among others.
