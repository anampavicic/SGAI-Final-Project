'''La Plata''' ({{IPA|es|la ˈplata}}) is the capital city of [[Buenos Aires Province]], [[Argentina]]. According to the 2022 [[Argentina census|census]], the [[La Plata Partido|Partido]] has a population of 772,618 and its [[metropolitan area]], the [[Greater La Plata]], has 938,287 inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Censo 2022: los habitantes de la provincia de Buenos Aires, ciudad por ciudad |url=https://infocielo.com/censo/censo-2022-los-habitantes-la-provincia-buenos-aires-ciudad-ciudad-n755475 |access-date=2023-02-01 |website=www.infocielo.com |language=es-AR}}</ref> It is located 9 kilometers (6 miles) inland from the southern shore of the {{Lang|es|[[Río de la Plata]]|italic=no}} estuary.

La Plata was [[Planned city|planned]] and developed to serve as the provincial capital after the city of [[Buenos Aires]] was [[Federalization of Buenos Aires|federalized]] in 1880. It was officially founded by Governor [[Dardo Rocha]] on 19 November 1882. Its construction is fully documented in photographs by Tomás Bradley Sutton.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.laplatamagica.com.ar/curi1882tercepar.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430123737/http://www.laplatamagica.com.ar/curi1882tercepar.htm|url-status=dead|title=Thomas Bradley: The photographer of Dardo Rocha (in Spanish)|archive-date=30 April 2009|access-date=25 August 2020}}</ref> La Plata was briefly known as ''Ciudad Eva Perón'' ([[Eva Perón]] City) between 1952 and 1955.

==History and description==
[[File:DardoRocha.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Governor [[Dardo Rocha]] (1838–1921), founder of La Plata.]]

[[File:Crop of ISS067-E-176677 La Plata, Argentina and vicinity.jpg|thumb|The city and vicinity at 8:19 PM locally on July 4, 2022, taken from the International Space Station.]]
After La Plata was designated the provincial capital, Rocha was placed in charge of creating the city. He hired urban planner [[Pedro Benoit]], who designed a city layout based on a [[rationalism|rationalist]] [[urban planning|conception of urban centers]]. The city has the shape of a square with a central park and two main diagonal avenues, north to south and east to west. In addition, there are numerous other shorter diagonal streets. This design is copied in a [[fractals|self-similar manner]] in small blocks of six by six blocks in length. For every six blocks, there is a small park or square. Other than the diagonal streets, all streets are on a rectangular grid and are numbered consecutively. Thus, La Plata is nicknamed "la ciudad de las diagonales" (city of diagonals). It is also called "la ciudad de los tilos" (city of [[linden tree]]s), because of the large number of linden trees lining the many streets and squares. The linden tree is one of a number of deciduous Northern Hemisphere tree species which dominate La Plata's parks and streets; [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[Aesculus hippocastanum|horsechestnut]], [[Platanus|plane]], [[Liquidambar styraciflua|sweetgum]] and [[Liriodendron tulipifera|tulip tree]] are among the other examples. [[Palm (plant)|Palms]] and subtropical broadleaf evergreen trees thrive but are comparatively infrequent.

The city design and its buildings are noted to possess strong [[Freemason]] symbolism as a consequence of both Rocha and Benoit being Freemasons.<ref name = TMT>{{cite web |url= http://www.themasonictrowel.com/articulos/files/la_masoneria_en_la_ciudad_de_la_plata.htm |language = es |title = The Masonic Trowel |publisher = Freemasons = 22 March 2014}}</ref>

The designs for the government buildings were chosen in an international architectural competition. Thus, the Governor Palace was designed by Italians, the City Hall by Germans, etc. Electric street lighting was installed in 1884 and was the first of its kind in Latin America.

=== Important landmarks ===
[[File:Buenos Aires - La Plata1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Cathedral of La Plata]]]]
The neo-Gothic [[cathedral of La Plata]] is the largest church in Argentina. It is located on the central park, Plaza Moreno, and is the 58th tallest church in the world.

The [[Teatro Argentino de La Plata]] is one of the most important [[opera house]]s in Argentina, second to the [[Teatro Colón]] in Buenos Aires. The construction was funded by the first inhabitants of La Plata, but as maintenance was very expensive it was later donated to the Province of Buenos Aires. On 18 October 1977, the building was almost completely destroyed by a fire. This has been noted as one of the largest losses to La Plata's historical heritage. It was later replaced by a new building, which houses the theatre's orchestra, choir and ballet, boasting several halls.

[[File:PA280461.JPG|thumb|Panoramic view of La Plata.]]
The [[Curutchet House]] is one of the two buildings by [[Le Corbusier]] built in the Americas.

The [[University of La Plata]] was founded in 1897 and nationalized in 1905. It is well known for its [[La Plata Astronomical Observatory|observatory]] and [[La Plata Museum|natural history museum]]. [[Ernesto Sabato]] graduated in Physics at this university; he went on to teach at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] before becoming a famed novelist. Doctor [[René Favaloro]] was another famous alumnus. During its early years, the university attracted a number of renowned intellectuals from the Spanish-speaking world, such as Dominican [[Pedro Henríquez Ureña]].

{{ill|San Ponciano church|es|Basílica de San Ponciano (La Plata)}} is on the corner of 48th and 5th Streets. It was the first chapel in La Plata and Pedro Benoit himself drew up the plans for the church. It was inaugurated on 19 November 1883, the first anniversary of the foundation of the city. Its [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic style]] has been well kept, and the inner paintings are now being restored. Then-governor Rocha was the one to name it "San Ponciano". This was both in memory of his son Ponciano and in honor of [[Pope Pontian]]. Inside the church is the "Virgen de Luján" niche, which was moved here in 1904.

=== La Plata in the 20th century ===
Under [[Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear|Alvear]]'s administration (1922–1928), [[Enrique Mosconi]], the president of the state oil company ''[[Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales]]'', created the La Plata [[distillery]], at the time the tenth largest in the world.<ref name=Pigna153>[[Felipe Pigna]], ''Los Mitos de la historia argentina, 3'', ed. Planeta Historia y Sociedad 2006, p. 153.</ref>
[[File:La Plata - Estación del Ferrocarril Roca.jpg|thumb|Railway station, La Plata.]]

On 10 December 1945, in the Parish church of St. Francis of Assisi in this city, [[Juan Domingo Perón]] and [[Eva Duarte]] were married.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lucesole|first=María José|title=Por Iglesia y en secreto|publisher=[[La Nación]]|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=210477|date=30 December 2001|access-date=15 September 2010|archive-date=31 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331140019/http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=210477|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1952, the city was renamed [[Ciudad Eva Perón]]; its original name was restored in 1955.

In March 1976, the Argentine military seized power following a [[coup d'état]], which involved the disappearance of a number of students from La Plata. The military junta had implemented what was called the [[National Reorganization Process]] which was a set of policies used by the regime to destroy left-wing guerrilla forces and oppress resistance to its rule. The process included kidnappings, torture and murder. Meanwhile, the [[Montoneros]], a leftist guerilla group, responded violently to the junta and its actions as they enlisted other Argentines to join their campaign against the regime. Those enlisted included young, left-wing, politically active students from the organization named the ''Unión de Estudiantes Secundarios'' (Union of High School Students) of La Plata. The UES was committed to achieving school reforms and other political reforms through demonstrations and protests that irked the ruling regime. Many of these students were kidnapped and killed (many remain as '[[Enforced disappearance|desaparecidos]]') as part of the [[State terrorism|state's terrorism]] during the [[Dirty War|dictatorship]].

In October 1998, [[UNESCO]] approved the city's bid to gain recognition as a [[World Heritage]] site. The approval is still pending due to various objections to the criterion of maintaining architectural and landscape features during recent decades, which in the opinion of other specialists, has caused severe damage to the original design and contextual aesthetics.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosa|first=José María|title=La fundación de La Plata|url=http://ar.geocities.com/paginajosemariarosa/tema09.htm|access-date=11 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725035553/http://ar.geocities.com/paginajosemariarosa/tema09.htm|archive-date=25 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Especiales – La Plata Histórica|publisher=[[El Día (Argentina)|El Día]]|url=http://www.eldia.com.ar/especiales/historicas/index.htm|access-date=11 January 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201034359/http://www.eldia.com.ar/especiales/historicas/index.htm|archive-date=1 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Historia de La Plata|publisher=La Plata Mágica|url=http://www.laplatamagica.com.ar/Historia.htm|access-date=11 January 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222120239/http://www.laplatamagica.com.ar/Historia.htm|archive-date=22 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Historia de La Plata en "El álbum de La Plata"|url=http://historiadelaplata.blogspot.com/|access-date=11 January 2009}}</ref>

=== Sports and stadiums ===
The city is home to two important [[Primera División Argentina|first division]] [[Association football|football]] teams: [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] and [[Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata|Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata]].

Estudiantes de La Plata is the most successful club in the city, having won seven national tournaments, four [[Copa Libertadores]] and the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] against the [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in 1968. It is the origin of several symbols of Argentine football such as [[Osvaldo Zubeldía]], [[Carlos Bilardo]], [[Alejandro Sabella]], [[Juan Ramón Verón|Juan Ramón]] and [[Juan Sebastián Verón]]. Estudiantes has had a great influence on the [[Argentina national football team|Argentine National Team]], mainly through Bilardo in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]]. Its successes and its style of play, normally called [[Carlos Bilardo|bilardismo]], have placed it in the position of exponent of a football style deeply rooted in the country.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Destape |first=El |date=2022-09-22 |title=Qué es el bilardismo, una de las escuelas más importantes del fútbol argentino |url=https://www.eldestapeweb.com/deportes/futbol-argentino/que-es-el-bilardismo-una-de-las-escuelas-mas-importantes-del-futbol-argentino-202292212490 |access-date=2023-02-01 |website=www.eldestapeweb.com |language=es}}</ref>

For its part, Gimnasia de La Plata, founded in [[1887]], has not obtained titles in the professional era, but it is a traditional First Division club.

The [[Estadio Ciudad de La Plata]], also known as the "Estadio Único", opened on 7 June 2003, as one of the most modern football stadiums in Latin America. Various other construction and renovation projects have continued, including the addition of a roof structure. [[Estudiantes de La Plata|Estudiantes]] played in the new stadium from 2006 to 2019 while their [[Estadio Jorge Luis Hirschi|own stadium]] was being modernized; Estudiantes returned to its traditional home ground of [[Jorge Luis Hirschi Stadium]] in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Página/12 |date=2019-11-04 |title=Estudiantes vuelve a 1 y 57 tras catorce años {{!}} El nuevo estadio será reinaugurado el próximo 9 de noviembre |url=https://www.pagina12.com.ar/229181-estudiantes-vuelve-a-1-y-57-tras-catorce-anos |access-date=2023-02-01 |website=PAGINA12 |language=es}}</ref> [[Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata|Gimnasia La Plata]] has only played occasional home games in the Estadio Único. In 2011, the Estadio Ciudad de La Plata was one of the host sites for the [[2011 Copa America]] including an opening-round match between [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]], a semifinal game, and the third-place final. Now, the stadium is additionally used for concerts and [[Argentina national rugby union team|Puma]] matches.

[[Jorge Luis Hirschi Stadium]], the home ground of Estudiantes, is located on 1st Avenue in La Plata. [[Estadio Juan Carmelo Zerillo]], the home ground of Gimnasia La Plata, is located in a park known as El Bosque.

During 2009, following a series of agreements between the city municipality, the governor of the province and the nation's presidency, progress was made in the final transfer of the land of the Paseo del Bosque to [[Estudiantes de La Plata|Estudiantes]] and [[Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata|Gimnasia La Plata]] clubs. On 24 June 2009, the Deliberative Council adopted the convention and the ordinance for which Gimnasia and Estudiantes clubs received "grants" for the lands on which their home grounds are currently located within El Bosque (The Forest).

=== Elections and civic advances ===
On 28 October 2007, [[Pablo Bruera]] was elected mayor with 26% of the votes, replacing [[Julio Alak]], who had been mayor since 1991.

On 25 February 2009, La Plata debuted a parking system that uses text messaging (SMS), thus becoming the first city in Argentina to control parking using technology applications.

The Pasaje Rodrigo, a traditional "galería" (the older version of shopping malls in Argentina), reopened its doors in April 2009 as Pasaje Rodrigo shopping mall, after having been closed to the public for 10 years. It had originally been opened in 1929 by Spanish immigrant Basilio Rodrigo.

On 25 October 2015, Julio Garro was elected mayor with 41,35% of the votes, replacing [[Pablo Bruera]], who had been mayor since 2007. Garro was reelected for a second term in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |last=www.eldia.com |first=Diario El Dia de La Plata |title=Diario El Dia de La Plata www.eldia.com |url=https://www.eldia.com/nota/2019-10-28-5-31-50-por-una-amplia-diferencia-garro-fue-reelecto-como-intendente-de-la-plata-politica-y-economia |access-date=2023-02-01 |website=www.eldia.com |language=es}}</ref> In the [[2023 Buenos Aires provincial election|2023 local elections]], former mayor Alak defeated Garro in an historically close election.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ambito.com/politica/la-justicia-ratifico-el-triunfo-alak-la-plata-y-rechazo-abrir-mas-urnas-n5863593|work=[[Ámbito Financiero]]|title=La Justicia ratificó el triunfo de Alak en La Plata y rechazó abrir más urnas|date=3 November 2023|access-date=9 December 2023|language=es}}</ref>

<!-- machine translation?
As a planned city built before, with thoughts of rationalizing tax in a style similar to that of the [[French Revolution]], it was built in the midst of consolidation of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the consecration of the [[Positivism|positivist]] science and the birth of the utopia of a socially and ecologically harmonious city. -->
La Plata is a [[New town|planned city]], characterized by a strict grid of square blocks, with diagonal avenues running across. The two major diagonals, 73 and 74, go across the city from east to west and from north to south, respectively, and converge right in the city's center at Plaza Moreno. This square houses the so-called "foundation stone" and is the main square of the city. To its sides are located the [[La Plata City Hall|City Hall]] and the [[cathedral of La Plata]]. Highlights of the city are the Museum of Natural Sciences, the building of the Interior, the Provincial Legislature, the new theater and the hippodrome. Many of these buildings were built at the time of the founding of the city, following an international call for proposals.

Another work is the parent company of ''Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Aires'', located between the streets 6, 7, 46 and 47. This building was designed by architects Juan A. Buschiazzo and Luis Viglione. It opened on 19 April 1886, being amended in 1913 and in the 1970s.<!-- machine translation?
In the "city of the lime trees and the diagonals" six streets is one avenue, and at each intersection of avenues you receive one of its 23 parks and squares (including the Paseo del Bosque), in turn interconnected by diagonals. Populated by some tree species that characterize them, especially lime-tree representing the city, as well as for bananas, the most abundant species in the path-jacarandas American maples, oranges, sticks drunk and havens, among others, city streets are presented as the most forested country between the cities and are the most friendly, fresh and invigorating to take a walk under the shade of leafy trees, and the extent to which a few blocks away center to receive the lively song of the myriad of starlings, woodpeckers, thrushes blackened, hummingbirds, oxpeckers, bakers, parrots and thrushes that has taken by assault the city. -->

It is a very green city, with its largest park being the "''Paseo del Bosque''" (or simply 'the forest'). Twenty-two other parks and squares contain much of the city's trees and greenery. Other landmarks include the lake, the Martin Fierro amphitheater, the Parque Pereyra Iraola, the Zoo and Botanical Garden, the Victorian astronomical observatory, and the Natural History Museum. One notable attraction is the Children's Republic, which is said to have inspired [[Walt Disney]] to build [[Disneyland]] after he visited it during a trip to Argentina.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1977 the city lost one of its most valuable monuments to a fire: the [[Teatro Argentino de La Plata]], predominantly built in a neoclassic style. After the fire, a new [[brutalist style]] theater was built in its place. The [[Estadio Ciudad de La Plata]], a stadium influenced by modern high-tech architecture, is located in the city. It was planned and built after a national competition during the 1970s. The stadium received repairs and amendments in a subsequent project in order to expand its capacity, and also to rebuild the roof in sectors that had been destroyed by storms.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |title=VIDEO: Así se ve el increíble trabajo para arreglar el techo del Estadio Único a casi 100 metros de altura |trans-title=VIDEO: This is how it looks to work fixing the roof of the Estadio Único 100 meters above the ground |url=https://www.0221.com.ar/nota/2018-9-24-14-3-0-video-asi-se-ve-el-increible-trabajo-para-arreglar-el-techo-del-estadio-unico-a-casi-100-metros-de-altura |access-date=2023-07-11 |website=www.0221.com.ar |language=es}}</ref> The construction of a semitransparent deck of [[Kevlar]] and plastic resins was finished in January 2011.{{clarify|date=July 2015}}

===Awards received by the city===
The city was awarded at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris in 1889, an event in which the new city was given the two gold medals awarded in the categories "City of the Future" and "Better performance built." At that event, Jules Verne gave the award to Dardo Rocha <ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=1999-10-11 |title=La Plata, exhibida en París |url=https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/plata-exhibida-paris_0_S13e3Y3eRFe.html?srsltid=AfmBOooy5hBdcAzbpsYg3ISPY6sHbvCGX9kRoOyeBcl_tCUkzkRCp_r9 |access-date=2024-09-08 |website=Clarín |language=es}}</ref>

===La Plata Cemetery===
[[File:Jacaranda (1).jpg|thumb|[[Jacaranda]] foliage and blossom]]
The municipal [[cemetery of La Plata]] was established in 1886 for the new capital of the province of Buenos Aires. It was designed by [[Pedro Benoit]]. It lies on the intersection of Avenue 31, 72 and diagonal 74 in the southern tip. It has some remarkable architectural features, both in its main entrance and in many of the family vaults, including [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]], [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]], [[Modern architecture|Art Nouveau]] (in its variant of [[Modernisme|Catalan Art Nouveau]]), [[Art Deco]] and [[Egyptian Revival architecture|Egyptian revival]] styles. The main entrance is an impressive neo-classical portico with [[Doric order|Doric columns]]. The Catholic chapel, in Romanesque revival style, was finished in 1950.  Diagonal 74 begins at the Río de la Plata and ends at the cemetery, causing some to remark that the layout may have been intentional symbolism of the cycle of life and death by Benoit.<ref>{{Cite web |last=www.eldia.com |first=Diario El Dia de La Plata |title=Diario El Dia de La Plata www.eldia.com |url=https://www.eldia.com/nota/2022-8-21-3-5-4-la-ciudad-de-los-muertos-una-noche-en-el-cementerio-de-la-plata-el-oriente-eterno-de-los-masones-informacion-general |access-date=2023-02-01 |website=www.eldia.com |language=es}}</ref>

After midnight, all the figures are burnt, igniting the firework-filling in the process, resulting in a fiery spectacle. For safety reasons, most figures are built in the same spot where they are planned to be burnt, which usually involves a large clearing in a plaza, wide [[median strip]]s, or abandoned lots. After the celebration, residents vote for the best figure in terms of design, size, etc., and the most voted gets a prize from a panel of established figure builders, as well as cash money reward.
