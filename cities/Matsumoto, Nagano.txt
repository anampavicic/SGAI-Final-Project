The total area of the city is {{convert|978.47|sqkm|sqmi}}.

==History==
Matsumoto is located in the former [[Shinano Province]] and was the [[kokufu|provincial capital]] from the [[Heian period]] onwards. The area developed as the [[castle town]] of [[Matsumoto Domain]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] of the [[Edo period]]. Modern Matsumoto Town was established with the creation of the municipalities system on April 1, 1889. It was raised to city status on May 1, 1907.

On February 1, 1925, Matsumoto absorbed the village of Matsumoto (from [[Higashichikuma District, Nagano|Higashichikuma District]]).

The city expanded further by annexing  the Kanda hamlet of the village of Nakayama from [[Higashichikuma District, Nagano|Higashichikuma District]] on April 1, 1943, the villages of Nakayama, Shimadachi and Shimauchi (all from [[Higashichikuma District, Nagano|Higashichikuma District]]) on April 1, 1954, the villages of Wada, Niimura, Kanbayashi, Sasaga, Yoshikawa, Kotobuki, Okada, Iriyamabe, Satoyamabe and Imai (all from [[Higashichikuma District, Nagano|Higashichikuma District]]) on August 1, 1954. Kitauchida and Gakenoyu hamlets were annexed from the Minamiuchida ward of the village of Kataoka in the city of [[Shiojiri, Nagano|Shiojiri]] on April 1, 1960 and April 1, 1961. The village of Hongo (from Higashichikuma District) on May 1, 1974 and parts of Seba hamlet (the hamlet of Kukohigashi) were annexed from Shiojiri on April 1, 1982.
 
Between the days of June 27 and June 28, 1994, the [[Matsumoto incident|Matsumoto Incident]] [[sarin]] gas attack occurred.

Matsumoto was proclaimed a [[Special cities of Japan|special city]] with increased local autonomy on November 1, 2000. Matsumoto annexed the villages of [[Azumi, Nagano|Azumi]], [[Azusagawa, Nagano|Azusagawa]] and [[Nagawa, Nagano (village)|Nagawa]] (all from [[Minamiazumi District, Nagano|Minamiazumi District]]), and the village of [[Shiga, Nagano|Shiga]] (from [[Higashichikuma District, Nagano|Higashichikuma District]]) on April 1, 2005. This was followed by the town of [[Hata, Nagano|Hata]] (from Higashichikuma District,) on March 31, 2010. Matsumoto was proclaimed a [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] with increased local autonomy on April 1, 2021.
