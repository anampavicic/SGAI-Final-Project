[[File:Wiesbaden 2022 logo.svg|thumb|Logo of the city of Wiesbaden]]

'''Wiesbaden''' ({{IPA|de|ˈviːsˌbaːdn̩|-|Wiesbaden.ogg}}; {{lit|meadow baths}}) is the capital of the German state of [[Hesse]], and the second-largest Hessian city after [[Frankfurt am Main]]. With around 283,000 inhabitants, it is [[List of cities in Germany by population|Germany's 24th-largest city]]. Wiesbaden forms a conurbation with a population of around 500,000 with the neighbouring city of [[Mainz]]. This conurbation is in turn embedded in the [[Rhine-Main|Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region]]—Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after [[Rhine-Ruhr]]—which also includes the nearby cities of [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Offenbach am Main]], and [[Hanau]], and has a combined population exceeding 5.8 million.

The city is located on the [[Rhine]] ([[Upper Rhine]]), at the foothills of the [[Taunus]], opposite the [[Rhineland-Palatine]] capital of [[Mainz]], and the city centre is located in the wide valley of the small [[Salzbach (Wiesbaden)|Salzbach]] stream. Wiesbaden lies in the [[Rheingau (wine region)|Rheingau wine-growing region]], one of Germany's [[List of German wine regions|13 wine regions]]. Three of Wiesbaden's boroughs were part of the city of [[Mainz]] until 1945, and still bear the designation "Mainz" in their names—the so-called AKK-boroughs of [[Mainz-Amöneburg]], [[Mainz-Kastel]], and [[Mainz-Kostheim]]. This so-called AKK-Konflikt ([[:de:AKK-Konflikt]]) is the main cause for the rivalry between Mainz and Wiesbaden. [[Wiesbaden Hauptbahnhof|Wiesbaden Main Station]] is connected to [[Frankfurt am Main]] by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn]] rapid transit system.

Historically, Wiesbaden was a [[Nassau (region)|Nassauian]] city. From 1170 to 1629, it lay in the [[County of Nassau]], and from 1629 to 1721, it was in the county and later principality of Nassau-Idstein, all of which were territories within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] ruled by branches of the [[House of Nassau]]. In 1728, the city found itself in the principality of [[Nassau-Usingen]], and in 1744, [[Biebrich Palace]] became the main residence of the House of Nassau-Usingen. In 1806, the city became the capital of the [[Duchy of Nassau]]. Since 1841, the newly built [[Wiesbaden City Palace]] was the principal Nassauian residence. From 1868 to 1944, the city lay in the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[Province of Hesse-Nassau]], and from 1944 to 1945, it was the capital of the [[Province of Nassau]]. In 1945, it became the capital of [[Greater Hesse]] and subsequently, in 1946, of [[Hesse]].

Wiesbaden is one of the oldest [[spa town]]s in Europe. Its name translates to "meadow baths", and there are 15 [[mineral springs]]—14 of which are [[hot springs]]—in the city centre.<ref>''Wiesbadener Tagblatt''. 18 September 2008</ref> With a yield of around 2 million liters daily, Wiesbaden is the second-most productive German spa after [[Aachen]]. Its location in a mountain basin at the southern foot of the [[Taunus]], protected by the mountains in the north and west, gives Wiesbaden a mild climate. It has been called the "[[Nice]] of the North" because of its climate and architecture.<ref>{{cite book |title= Wiesbaden: For Old Friends and New|last= Heinrich-Verlag GmBH|year= 2011|publisher= Heinrich-Verlag GmBH|isbn= 978-3-89889-167-7|page= 4}}</ref> The city of Wiesbaden is one of the wealthiest cities in Germany and one of those with above-average purchasing power.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ihk-wiesbaden.de/blob/wiihk24/standort/downloads/3673134/a84f4bcc1fe3be9ec5f85c8a5dfa7b96/Kaufkraft-2016-IHK-Wiesbaden-data.pdf |title=Kaufkraft 2017 |website=IHK Wiesbaden |access-date=24 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825021228/https://www.ihk-wiesbaden.de/blob/wiihk24/standort/downloads/3673134/a84f4bcc1fe3be9ec5f85c8a5dfa7b96/Kaufkraft-2016-IHK-Wiesbaden-data.pdf |archive-date=25 August 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[United States Army Europe and Africa]] headquarters are located in [[Wiesbaden-Erbenheim]].

==Geography==

Wiesbaden is situated on the right (northern) bank of the [[Rhine]], above the confluence of the [[Main (river)|Main]], where the Rhine's main direction changes from north to west. The city is across the Rhine from Mainz, the capital of the state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. Frankfurt am Main is located about {{convert|38|km|mi|1}} east. To the north of the city are the [[Taunus]] Mountains, which trend in a northeasterly direction.

The city center, the ''Stadtmitte'', is located in the north-easternmost part of the [[Upper Rhine Valley]] at the spurs of the Taunus mountains, about {{convert|5|km|mi|1}} from the Rhine. The landscape is formed by a wide lowland between the Taunus heights in the north, the Bierstadter Höhe and the Hainerberg in the east, the Mosbacher Mountain in the south, and the Schiersteiner Mountain in the west, an offshoot of the Taunus range.

The downtown is drained only by the narrow valley of the Salzbach, a tributary of the Rhine, on the eastern flanks of the Mosbacher Mountain. The city's main railway line and the Mainz road (''Mainzer Straße'') follow this valley. Several other streams drain into the Salzbach within the city center: the Wellritzbach, the Kesselbach, the Schwarzbach, the Dambach, and the Tennelbach, as well as the outflow of many thermal and mineral springs in the ''Kurhaus'' (spa) district. Above the city center, the Salzbach is better known as the Rambach.

The highest point of the Wiesbaden municipality is located northwest of the city center near the summit of the Hohe Wurzel, with an elevation of {{convert|608|m|ft|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The lowest point is the harbour entrance of Schierstein at {{convert|83|m|ft|0}} above sea level. The central square (the ''Schlossplatz'', or palace square) is at an elevation of {{convert|115|m|ft|0}}.

Wiesbaden covers an area of {{convert|204|km2|0|abbr=on}}. It is {{convert|17.6|km|mi|1}} from north to south and {{convert|19.7|km|mi|1}} from west to east. In the north are vast forest areas, which cover 27.4% of the urban area. In the west and east are [[vineyards]] and agricultural land, which cover 31.1% of the area. Of the municipality's {{convert|79|km|mi|1}}-long border, the Rhine makes up {{convert|10.3|km|mi|1}}.

===Climate===
Wiesbaden has a [[temperate climate|temperate]]-[[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''; [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Dobk'') with relatively cold winters and warm summers. Its average annual temperature is {{convert|9.8|°C|1}}, with monthly mean temperatures ranging from {{convert|1.2|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|18.9|°C|1}} in July.

The Wiesbaden weather station has recorded the following extreme values:<ref name=sklima/>
* Highest Temperature {{convert|38.9|C|F}} on [[2019_European_heatwaves#Germany|25 July 2019]].
* Lowest Temperature {{convert|-18.7|C|F}} on 19 December 2009.
* Wettest Year {{convert|1067.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} in 1965.
* Driest Year {{convert|473.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} in 1976.
* Highest Daily Precipitation: {{convert|71.0|mm|in|abbr=on}} on 7 October 1982.
* Earliest Snowfall: 5 November 1966.
* Latest Snowfall: 15 April 2001.

==History==

===Classical antiquity===
While evidence of settlement at present-day Wiesbaden dates back to the [[Neolithic]] era, historical records document continuous occupancy after the erection of a [[Roman empire|Roman]] fort in 6&nbsp;AD which housed an auxiliary cavalry unit. The [[hot spring|thermal springs]] of Wiesbaden are first mentioned in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''. They were famous for their recreation pools for Roman army horses and possibly as the source of a mineral used for red hair dye (which was very fashionable around the turn of BC/AD among women in Rome).<ref>Csysz, Walter: Wiesbaden in der Römerzeit. Aalen: Theiss editors, 2000; mentioned by Roman poet [[Martial]]: Epigrammata 14, 27.</ref>

The Roman settlement is first mentioned using the name ''Aquae Mattiacorum'' ([[Latin]] for "Waters of the Mattiaci") in 121. The [[Mattiaci]] were a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]], possibly a branch of the neighboring [[Chatti]], who lived in the vicinity at that time. The town also appears as Mattiacum in [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Geographia]] (2.10). The Roman Empire built the [[Limes Germanicus]], which was a line of Roman frontier fortifications in the [[Taunus]]. Wiesbaden is just south of the Taunus.

The capital of the province of [[Germania Superior]], [[Mogontiacum]] (present-day [[Mainz]]), base of 2 (at times 3) Roman legions, was just over the Rhine and connected by a bridge at the present-day borough of [[Mainz-Kastel]] (Roman "''castellum''"), a strongly fortified bridgehead.

The [[Alamanni]], a coalition of Germanic tribes from beyond the ''Limes'', captured the fort around 260. Later, in the 370s, when the Romans and Alamanni were allied, the Alemanni gained control of the Wiesbaden area and were in charge of its defense against other Germanic tribes.

===Middle Ages===
After the [[Franks]] under [[Clovis I]] defeated the Alamanni in the [[Battle of Tolbiac]] in 496, the Franks eventually displaced the Alamanni in the Wiesbaden area over the course of the 6th century. In the 8th century, Wiesbaden became the site of a royal [[palace]] of the Frankish kingdom. The first documented use of the name Wiesbaden is by [[Einhard]], the biographer of [[Charlemagne]], whose writings mention "Wisabada" sometime between 828 and 830.

When the Frankish [[Carolingian Empire]] broke up in 888, Wiesbaden was in the eastern half, called [[East Francia]] (which would evolve into the [[Holy Roman Empire]]). The town was part of [[Franconia]], the heartland of East Francia. In the 1170s, the [[Count]] of [[Nassau (state)|Nassau]], Walram I, received the area around Wiesbaden as a [[fiefdom]]. When Franconia fragmented in the early 13th century, Nassau emerged as an independent state as part of the Holy Roman Empire.

In 1232 Wiesbaden became a [[Reichsstadt]], an imperial city, of the Holy Roman Empire. However, in 1242, during the war of Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] against the Pope, the [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Archbishop of Mainz]], [[Siegfried III (Archbishop of Mainz)|Siegfried III]], ordered the city's destruction.

Wiesbaden returned to the control of the [[House of Nassau]] in 1270 under Count [[Walram II, Count of Nassau]]. However, Wiesbaden and the castle at [[Wiesbaden-Sonnenberg|Sonnenberg]] were again destroyed in 1283 in conflict with [[Eppstein]].

Walram's son and successor [[Adolf, King of the Romans|Adolf]] would later become king of [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] from 1292 until 1298. In 1329, under Adolf's son [[Gerlach I of Nassau-Wiesbaden|Gerlach I of Nassau-Weilburg]] the House of Nassau and thereby, Wiesbaden, received the right of [[currency|coinage]] from Holy Roman Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis the Bavarian]].

In 1355, the County of Nassau-Weilburg was divided among the sons of Gerlach. The County of Nassau's holdings would be subdivided many times among heirs, with the parts being brought together again whenever a line died out. Wiesbaden became the seat of the County of Nassau-Wiesbaden under Count Adolf I (1307–1370), eldest son of Gerlach. It would eventually fall back to Nassau-Weilburg in 1605.

===Modern era===
[[File:Wiesbaden De Merian Hassiae.jpg|thumb|A view of Wiesbaden from the ''Topographia Hassiae'' by [[Matthäus Merian]] in 1655|295px]]
Due to its participation in the uprisings of the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, Wiesbaden lost all its privileges for over 40 years. During this time, Wiesbaden became [[Protestant]] with the nomination of Wolf Denthener as first [[Lutheran]] pastor on 1 January 1543. The same day, the first Latin school was opened, preparing pupils for the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Idstein]]. In 1566, the privileges of the city were restored.

The oldest remaining building of Wiesbaden, the old city hall, was built in 1609 and 1610. No older buildings are preserved due to two fires in 1547 and 1561. In 1648, at the end of the devastating [[Thirty Years' War]], chronicles tell that Wiesbaden had barely 40 residents left. In 1659, the County of Nassau-Weilburg was divided again. Wiesbaden became part of the County of Nassau-Usingen. In 1744, the seat of Nassau-Usingen was moved to [[Biebrich (Wiesbaden)|Biebrich]]. In 1771, the Count of Nassau-Usingen granted a concession for gambling in Wiesbaden. In 1810, the Wiesbaden Casino (German: ''Spielbank'') was opened in the old Kurhaus. Gambling was later outlawed by [[Prussia]]n authorities in 1872.

As a result of [[Napoleon]]'s victory over Austria in the [[Battle of Austerlitz]], the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1805. On 12 July 1806, 16 states in present-day Germany, including the remaining counties of Nassau-Usingen and Nassau-Weilburg, formally left the Holy Roman Empire and joined in the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. Napoleon was its "protector". Under pressure from Napoleon, both counties merged to form the [[Duchy of Nassau]] on 30 August 1806.

[[File:Wiesbaden Waterloo Memorian.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial for [[Duchy of Nassau|Nassauers]] fallen at the [[Battle of Waterloo]]]]At the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]], the Duchy of Nassau joined the [[German Confederation]]. The capital of Nassau was moved from Weilburg to Wiesbaden, and the city became the ducal residence. Building activity started to give the city a magnificent appearance. Most of the historical center of Wiesbaden dates back to this time.

[[File:Wiesbaden Innenstadt.jpg|thumb|The [[Marktkirche, Wiesbaden|Marktkirche]], designed by [[Carl Boos]]: Its neo-Gothic steeple dominates the [[Pentagon (Wiesbaden)|Historical Pentagon]].]]
In the [[Revolutions of 1848]], 30,000 citizens of Nassau assembled in Wiesbaden on 4 March. They demanded a constitution from the Duke, which they received.

In the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, Nassau took Austria's side. This decision led to the end of the duchy. After the Austrian defeat, Nassau was annexed by [[Prussia]] and became part of the Prussian [[province of Hesse-Nassau]]. The deposed duke [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Adolph of Nassau]] in 1890 became the [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]] (see [[House of Nassau]]). This turned out to be a fortunate change for the city, as it then became an international spa town. A rise in construction commenced after the aristocracy followed the lead of the Hohenzollern emperors, who began annual trips to Wiesbaden.<ref>{{cite book |title= Wiesbaden: For Old Friends and New|last= Heinrich-Verlag GmBH|year= 2011|publisher= Heinrich-Verlag GmBH|isbn= 978-3-89889-167-7|pages= 11}}</ref>

The period around the turn of the 20th century is regarded as the heyday of the city. [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] visited the city regularly in summer, such that it became an unofficial "summer residence". The city was also popular among the Russian nobility. In the wake of the imperial court, numerous nobles, artists, and wealthy businessmen increasingly settled in the city. Many wealthy persons chose Wiesbaden as their retirement seat, as it offered leisure and medical treatment alike. In the latter part of the 19th century, Wiesbaden became the German city with the most millionaires.<ref>{{cite book |title= Wiesbaden: For Old Friends and New|last= Heinrich-Verlag GmBH|year= 2011|publisher= Heinrich-Verlag GmBH|isbn= 978-3-89889-167-7|pages= 12}}</ref>

In 1894, the present Hessian State Theater, designed by the Vienna architects Fellner and Helmer, was built on behalf of Kaiser Wilhelm II.

===Weimar Republic and Third Reich (1919 to 1945)===
After World War I, Wiesbaden fell under the Allied occupation of the Rhineland and was occupied by the French army in 1918. In 1921, the Wiesbaden Agreement on German reparations to France was signed in the city. In 1925, Wiesbaden became the headquarters of the [[British Army of the Rhine]] until the withdrawal of occupying forces from the Rhineland in 1930.

In 1929, an airport was constructed in Erbenheim on the site of a horse-racing track. In 1936, [[Jagdgeschwader 53|Fighter Squadron 53]] of the [[Luftwaffe]] was stationed here.

In the [[Kristallnacht]] pogrom on 10 November 1938, Wiesbaden's large synagogue on Michelsberg was destroyed. The synagogue had been designed by Phillip Hoffmann and built in 1869. Another synagogue in [[Wiesbaden-Bierstadt]] was also destroyed. When the Nazis came to power in Germany, there were 2,700 Jews living in Wiesbaden. By June 1942 nearly all of them had been deported to the [[extermination camps]] in [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|German-occupied Poland]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Wiesbaden &#124; The Valley of the Communities|url=https://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/valley/wiesbaden/index.asp?WT.mc_id=wiki|access-date=8 January 2023|website=www.yadvashem.org|archive-date=30 January 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230130114528/https://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/valley/wiesbaden/index.asp?WT.mc_id=wiki|url-status=live}}</ref>

General [[Ludwig Beck]] from Wiesbaden was one of the planners of the [[20 July plot|20 July 1944 assassination attempt]] of [[Adolf Hitler]]. Beck was designated by his fellow conspirators to be future Head of State (Regent) after elimination of Hitler. The plot failed, however, and Beck was forced to commit suicide. Today, the city annually awards the Ludwig Beck prize for civil courage in his honor.

Lutheran pastor and theologian [[Martin Niemöller]], founder of the [[Confessing Church]] resistance movement against the Nazis, is an Honorary Citizen of Wiesbaden. He presented his last sermon before his arrest in Wiesbaden's Market Church.

===World War II===
In World War II, Wiesbaden was the headquarters for Germany's [[Wehrkreis XII]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tessin |first=Georg |title=Verzeichnis der Friedensgarnisonen 1932–1939 und Stationierungen im Kriege 1939–1945.

After the [[Battle of France]], this ''Wehrkreis'' was extended to include [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]], including [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], and the Grand Duchy of [[Luxembourg]]. The commander was ''General der Infanterie'' [[Walther Schroth]].

''Wehrkreis'' XII was made up of three subordinate regions: ''Bereich Hauptsitze'' [[Koblenz]], [[Mannheim]] and [[Metz]].

*''Bereich Hauptsitz'' Koblenz was the headquarters for 12 ''Unterregion-Hauptsitze'', namely [[Trier]] I, Trier II, [[Koblenz]], [[Neuwied]], [[Kreuznach]], Wiesbaden, [[Limburg an der Lahn]], [[Lahn]], [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Darmstadt]], and [[Luxembourg]].
*''Bereich Hauptsitz'' Mannheim was the headquarters for 10 ''Unterregion-Hauptsitze'', namely [[Saarlautern]], [[Saarbrücken]], [[St. Wendel]], [[Zweibrücken]], [[Kaiserslautern]], [[Neustadt an der Weinstraße]], [[Ludwigshafen]] (Rhein), [[Mannheim]] I, Mannheim II, and [[Heidelberg]].
*''Bereich Hauptsitz'' Metz was the headquarters for ''Unterregion-Hauptsitze'' [[Metz]], [[Diedenhofen]] (Thionville), and [[Saint-Avold]].

During the war, Wiesbaden was, between August 1940 and the end of 1942, bombed by the [[Royal Air Force]] and from 1943 through to March 1945, was attacked by both RAF and United States Air Force bombers on 66 days. In the attacks, about 18% of the city's homes were destroyed. During the war, more than 25% of the city's buildings were damaged or worse and 1,700 people were killed.<ref name="Heinrich-Verlag GmBH-2011">{{cite book |title= Wiesbaden: For Old Friends and New|last= Heinrich-Verlag GmBH|year= 2011|publisher= Heinrich-Verlag GmBH|isbn= 978-3-89889-167-7|pages= 80}}</ref>

Wiesbaden was the location of a camp for [[Sinti]] and [[Romani people]] (see ''[[Romani Holocaust]]''),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=100001028|title=Lager für Sinti und Roma Wiesbaden|website=Bundesarchiv.de|access-date=9 January 2024|language=de}}</ref> and two subcamps of the [[Hinzert concentration camp]], mostly for Luxembourgish prisoners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Megargee|first=Geoffrey P.|year=2009|title=The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos 1933–1945.

Wiesbaden was captured by U.S. Army forces on 28 March 1945. The U.S. 317th Infantry Regiment attacked in assault boats across the Rhine from Mainz while the 319th Infantry attacked across the river Main near [[Hochheim am Main]]. The attack started at 01:00 and by early afternoon the two forces of the [[80th Division (United States)|80th U.S. Infantry Division]] had linked up with the loss of only three dead and three missing. The Americans captured 900 German soldiers and a warehouse full of 4,000 cases of champagne.<ref>The Last Offensive by Charles B. MacDonald, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 71-183070</ref>

After the war's end, American rock artist [[Elvis Presley]] was stationed in Friedberg and often visited Wiesbaden.<ref name="Heinrich-Verlag GmBH-2011"/>

===Cold War and contemporary history===
After World War II, the state of Hesse was established (see [[Greater Hesse]]), and Wiesbaden became its capital, though nearby [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]] is much larger and works as Hesse's economic and financial centre. Wiesbaden however suffered much less than Frankfurt from air bombing. There is a persistent rumour that the U.S. Army Air Force spared the town with the intention of turning it into a postwar HQ, but USAAF sources claim this to be a myth, arguing that Wiesbaden's economic and strategic importance simply did not justify more bombing.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Wiesbaden was host to the Headquarters, U.S. Air Forces, Europe based at the former [[Europaviertel (Wiesbaden)|Lindsey Air Station]] from 1953 to 1973.

[[American armed forces]] have been present in Wiesbaden since World War II. The [[U.S. 1st Armored Division]] was headquartered at the [[Wiesbaden Army Airfield]], just off the [[autobahn]] toward Frankfurt, until the Division completed relocation to Fort Bliss, Texas, in 2011. Wiesbaden is now home to the [[U.S. Army Europe]] Headquarters and the General [[John Shalikashvili]] Mission Command Center.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eur.army.mil/news/2012/06112014_Wiesbaden_ceremonies.html |title=Wiesbaden ceremonies mark key milestones in U.S. Army Europe transition |publisher=Eur.army.mil |date=14 June 2012 |access-date=13 August 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317120017/http://www.eur.army.mil/news/2012/06112014_Wiesbaden_ceremonies.html |archive-date=17 March 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

In 1962, the American artists [[George Maciunas]], [[Dick Higgins]] and [[Alison Knowles]] traveled to Europe to promote a planned "[[Fluxus]]" publication with concerts of antique musical instruments, the “Fluxus Internationale Festspiele Neuester Music” (Fluxus International Festival of Newest Music) at the Museum Wiesbaden. Fourteen concerts were performed on four weekends between 1 and 23 September which marked the beginning of the Fluxus movement. Work by musicians such as [[John Cage]], [[György Ligeti]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Brion Gysin]] and others were performed alongside new performance pieces written by Higgins, Knowles, [[George Brecht]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Ben Patterson]], [[Robert Filliou]], [[Emmett Williams]], and others. One performance in particular, "Piano Activities" by [[Philip Corner]], became notorious by challenging the important status of the piano in post-war German homes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.schirn.de/en/magazine/context/2019/big_orchestra/fluxus_in_wiesbaden_big_orchestra/ |title="Fluxus is a big ship on which to take a great excursion" |author=Elke Gruhn |publisher=Schirn Mag |date=9 June 2019 |access-date=29 September 2024 }}</ref>

==Bathing and gambling==
Wiesbaden has long been famous for its thermal springs and spa. Use of the thermal springs was first documented by the Romans. The business of spring bathing became important for Wiesbaden near the end of the [[Middle Ages]]. By 1370, 16 bath houses were in operation. By 1800, the city had 2,239 inhabitants and 23 bath houses.

By 1900, Wiesbaden, with a population of 86,100, hosted 126,000 visitors annually. Famous visitors to the springs included [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], [[Richard Wagner]], [[Johannes Brahms]], and [[Henrik Pontoppidan]]. In those years, more millionaires were living in Wiesbaden than in any other city in Germany.

Gambling followed bathing ''en suite'', and in the 19th century, Wiesbaden was famous for both. Its casino (''Spielbank'') rivalled those of [[Bad Homburg]], [[Baden-Baden]], and [[Monaco]]. In 1872, the Prussian-dominated imperial government closed down all German gambling houses. The Wiesbaden casino was reopened in 1949.

==Main sights==
{{Wide image|MK 36878-82 Wiesbaden vom Neroberg.jpg|1280px|A panorama of Wiesbaden from the [[Neroberg]]}}

===The Palace Square===
[[File:Stadtschloss Wiesbaden.jpg|thumb|right|The former Ducal Palace|225px]]The ''[[Schloßplatz (Wiesbaden)|Schloßplatz]]'' ("palace square") is situated in the center of the city, surrounded by several outstanding buildings. The [[Stadtschloss, Wiesbaden|ducal palace]] was begun under [[William, Duke of Nassau]]. Its foundations were laid in 1837 and it was completed in November 1841 (two years after William's death). For the twenty-six remaining years of ducal authority it was the residence of the ruling family. It later served as a secondary residence for the King of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] 1866 to 1918. It was later used as a headquarters for French and British occupying forces after World War I, then as a museum.

Since 1945, the building has served as [[Hessian Landtag|Landtag]] (parliamentary building) for the state of Hesse. The site of the palace had been that of a castle, probably from the early Middle Ages, around which the city had developed. While nothing is known of the former castle, remains of it were uncovered during excavations after World War II.
[[File:Altes Rathaus - Wiesbaden, 1893.tif|thumb|New Town Hall, picture taken 1893]]
[[File:MK10960 Marktstraße 16 Altes Rathaus.jpg|thumb|Old Town Hall]]
The new town hall was built in 1887.  A tile mosaic in front of the town hall shows the [[heraldic beast|heraldic eagle]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (of which Wiesbaden was a part at the time), the [[coat of arms]] of the Prussian [[Province of Hesse-Nassau]], and the [[fleur-de-lis]] of Wiesbaden. The old town hall, built in 1610, is the oldest preserved building in the city center and now is used as a civil registry office.

The [[Protestant]] ''[[Marktkirche, Wiesbaden|Marktkirche]]'' ("market church") was built from 1852 to 1862 in a [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic]] style. Its western steeple is {{convert|92|m|abbr=off}} in height, making the church the highest building in the city.

===Kurhaus and Theater===
[[File:Kurhaus Wiesbaden blaue Stunde 290-L4.jpg|thumb|Kurhaus with Fountain on the Bowling Green]]
{{Main|Kurhaus, Wiesbaden|Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden|Bowling Green, Wiesbaden}}
The monumental [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-Classical]] ''[[Kurhaus, Wiesbaden|Kurhaus]]'' ("spa house") was built at the request of Kaiser [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]] between 1904 and 1907. Its famous ''Spielbank'' (casino) is again in operation.

In front of the Kurhaus is a lawn known as the Bowling Green. To one side of the Bowling Green is the Kurhaus Kolonnade. Built in 1827, the 129 meter structure is the longest hall in Europe supported by pillars. To the other side is the Theater Kolonnade, built in 1839. It is adjacent to the [[Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden]], built between 1892 and 1894.

===St. Bonifatius===
{{Main|St. Bonifatius, Wiesbaden}}
[[St. Bonifatius, Wiesbaden|St. Bonifatius]], the first church for the Catholic community after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], was built from 1845 until 1849 by Philipp Hoffmann in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival style]] and dedicated to [[Saint Boniface]].

===St. Elizabeth's Church===
The Russian Orthodox [[St. Elizabeth's Church, Wiesbaden|Church of Saint Elizabeth]], called ''Griechische Kapelle'' (Greek chapel) locally, was built on the [[Neroberg]] from 1847 to 1855 by Duke Adolf of Nassau on the occasion of the early death of his wife [[Elizabeth Mikhailovna]], who died in childbirth. The architect was again Philipp Hoffmann.

===Other sights===
Another building from the regency of Duke Wilhelm is the Luisenplatz, a square named for the Duke's first wife. It is surrounded by [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassicist]] buildings, and in the middle of the square is the [[Waterloo Battle|Waterloo]] [[Obelisk]], commemorating the 683 Nassauers who died on 18 June 1815 near [[Hougoumont]] Farm in the respective battle against [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]].<ref>The Duchy of Nassau participated with two regiments of total 6180 men infantry, about half came under fire and mainly 2nd rgt. 1st battalion in the defense of the fortified [[Hougoumont Farm]]. The duke issued a medal to all surviving participants in 1816. https://www.nmm.nl/zoeken-in-de-collectie/detail/231159/{{Dead link|date=March 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Apart from the palace in the center, the ducal family had a large palace on the banks of the Rhine, known as [[Schloss Biebrich]]. This [[baroque architecture|baroque building]] was erected in the first half of the 18th century.

North of the city is the [[Neroberg]]. From the top of this hill it is possible to view a panorama of the city. The [[Nerobergbahn]] [[funicular|funicular railway]] connects the city with the hill. South of it, the [[Nerotalanlagen]] are a park along a creek, created in 1897/98 as an [[English landscape garden]].

One of the three Hessian state museums, [[Museum Wiesbaden]] is located in Wiesbaden.

Other churches are the [[Bergkirche, Wiesbaden|Bergkirche]], completed in 1879 in Gothic Revival style, and the [[Lutherkirche, Wiesbaden|Lutherkirche]], finished in 1910 in [[Jugendstil]]. The church [[Mariä Heimsuchung, Wiesbaden|Mariä Heimsuchung]] is a tall concrete landmark in the Kohlheck suburb.

Oriental Christianity is also represented with the St. Isaiah [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] on the Willi-Juppe-Straße in Dotzheim, built in 2016 by Suryoye-[[Assyrian people|Assyrians]].

The Warmer Damm park is a 4.5-hectare park on the east side of Wilhelmstrasse and south of the State theater and Kurhaus which features a lake, a fountain, various statues, and large grassy areas. The park was created in 1859–1860 and is named after the medieval fortifications around a pond into which the warm waters of the town's 26 warm springs flowed.<ref>{{cite book |title= Wiesbaden: For Old Friends and New|last= Heinrich-Verlag GmBH|year= 2011|publisher= Heinrich-Verlag GmBH|isbn= 978-3-89889-167-7|pages= 14–15}}</ref>

==Boroughs of Wiesbaden==
The city of Wiesbaden is divided into 26 boroughs: five in the central city and 21 suburban districts. The 21 suburban districts were incorporated in four phases from 1926 to 1977. The former Mainz suburbs on the right bank of river Rhine viz. Amöneburg, Kastel and Kostheim have belonged to Wiesbaden since 1945.

Wiesbaden has a population of about 280,000. In 1946, when Wiesbaden became the capital of [[Hesse]] state, it had a population of about 188,000. At that time, Wiesbaden was a part of [[American-occupied zone of Germany|American occupied zone]] and parts of the city of [[Mainz]], which was the right side on the [[Rhine]] river, became a part of Wiesbaden. In 1950s many Americans came to Wiesbaden due to its jobs by military bases. Many people who work in [[Frankfurt]] live in Wiesbaden due to its high rent of the city. Wiesbaden is one of the most international cities in Germany with people from over 180 countries.
