'''Avadi''' ({{IPA-ta|aːʋaɖi|lang}}) is a western suburb of [[Chennai]], and the headquarters of [[Avadi taluk]] located within the [[Thiruvallur district]] of [[Tamil Nadu]], India. Situated at about {{convert|22|km||abbr=}} from [[Chennai Central|Chennai Central Railway Station]], it is one of the four [[municipal corporation]]s in the [[Chennai Metropolitan Area]] and is governed by the [[Avadi Municipal Corporation]]. It is surrounded by major defence establishments and is home to various universities and engineering colleges. The neighborhood is served by [[Avadi Railway Station]] of the [[Chennai Suburban Railway]] and just 7 km from the upcoming Karayanchavadi Metro of [[Chennai Metro Rail]] . As of 2011, Avadi had a population of 345,996, which is 10th most populous place in Tamil Nadu. It is home to the [[Heavy Vehicles Factory]] (HVF), [[Ordnance Factory Board]] (ODF) which houses Engine Factory and [[Combat Vehicles Research and Development Establishment]] (CVRDE). The lake in Avadi was known as Paaleripattu, which is now found only in very old land documents.

==Etymology==
The exact origin of the name 'Avadi' is not known. One version has it that it is the combination of "Aa" (meaning cow) and "Adi or gudi (kudi)" (meaning place in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]), indicating that the place had many cows.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} One of the more popular theories about the origin of the name is that it is an acronym for "Armoured Vehicles and Ammunition Depot of India". However, this is most likely a [[backronym]] invented more recently. The entity "Armoured Vehicles and Ammunition Depot of India" does not appear in any British records.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-01-31 |title=The etymology of some Chennai place names - Madras Heritage and Carnatic Music |url=https://sriramv.com/2015/01/31/the-etymology-of-some-chennai-place-names/ |access-date=2024-05-13 |website=sriramv.com |language=en-US}}</ref> This acronym is further disputed by the existence of a railway station going by the name of "Avadi" in the locality since 1873 before the establishment of defence industries.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sriram |first=V. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1306192983 |title=Chennai : a biography |date=2021 |isbn=978-93-90652-98-3 |location=New Delhi |oclc=1306192983}}</ref>

Several British documents from the 19th century refer to the place as "Avady", which doesn't match the widely circulated acronym theory.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Madras Journal of Literature and Science |date=1866 |volume=17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HshKAAAAcAAJ&q=Madras+%22Avady%22&pg=PA34|title=The Madras journal of literature and science: 1866 }}</ref> The name Avadi (Avady) was already in use by 1856, when the first public railway was opened in the Madras Presidency. This predates the transfer of the Madras Presidency's arsenal from [[Fort St. George, India]] in the city of Madras, to Avadi, which was done sometime after 1870, which contradicts the popular acronym theory.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

==History==
The suburb is part of the "auto belt" that developed when the automobile industry developed in Madras, primarily in the city's industrial north and west regions, in the early post-[[World War II]] years.<ref>{{cite book | last = Muthiah| first = S. | author-link = S. Muthiah | title = Madras Rediscovered| publisher = EastWest | date = 2014 | location = Chennai | pages = 144 | isbn = 978-93-84030-28-5}}</ref>

The famous session of the [[Indian National Congress]] was held at Avadi on 10 January 1955.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/01/10/stories/2005011000950901.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050113002010/http://www.hindu.com/2005/01/10/stories/2005011000950901.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2005-01-13|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=2005-01-10|title=Miscellaneous / This Day That Age : dated January 10, 1955: Avadi session of Congress}}</ref> This historical meet emphasised the importance of socialism and its impact on social development. [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] with [[Morarji Desai]] and other Congress leaders at the AICC session declared that a socialistic pattern of society was the goal of the Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2919/stories/20121005291902500.htm|title=Long way from Avadi|work=frontline.in}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://madrasmusings.com/Vol%2021%20No%207/when-the-congress-met-in-madras.html|title=Madras Musings - We care for Madras that is Chennai|work=madrasmusings.com}}</ref>

==Geography==
Avadi is located at {{Coord|13.12|N|80.1|E|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/25/Avadi.html |title=Maps, Weather, Videos, and Airports for Avadi, India |publisher=Fallingrain.com |access-date=28 April 2012}}</ref> It covers an area of {{convert|65|km2}} and has an average elevation of {{convert|17|m}}.

=== Lake ===
[[Image:Avadi lake.jpeg|thumb|250px|A view of the Avadi lake before renovation]]

Avadi has a lake called [[Paruthipattu Lake]]. Spread over 200 acres and {{convert|2.64|km}} in length,<ref name=outskirts/> the lake is located behind the Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB) and [[Thirumullaivoyal]]. It was once a source of water for farmland irrigation. The body of water attracts many birds throughout the year. However, in the recent decades it has lost most of its area to indiscriminate building and encroachment. The Paruthippattu Lake area was renovated with a budget of 32 crores and converted into an eco-park that officially opened on 19 June 2019. The renovation added recreational facilities, a 3-km-long walking track, a central plaza and various greenery, while addressing the issues of encroachment and sewage pollution that had affected the once-neglected lake.<ref name=outskirts>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/paruthipattu-lake-on-city-outskirts-to-get-eco-park-on-lines-of-chetpet/article25440136.ece|title = Paruthipattu lake on city outskirts to get eco-park on lines of Chetpet|newspaper = The Hindu|date = 8 November 2018|last1 = Lakshmi|first1 = K.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2019/jun/19/avadi-becomes-tns-15th-municipal-corporation-1992128.html|title = Avadi becomes TN's 15th municipal corporation}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/eco-park-at-paruthipattu-lake-to-be-ready-by-month-end/article26525987.ece|title = Eco-park at Paruthipattu lake to be ready by month-end|newspaper = The Hindu|date = 14 March 2019|last1 = Lakshmi|first1 = K.}}</ref>

The neighborhood generates about 150 metric tonnes of garbage daily. Together with [[Thiruninravur]] and [[Poonamallee]], Avadi generates about 210 metric tonnes of solid waste from around 120,000 households, which is dumped on a 17.78-acre site in Sekkadu, owned by the Avadi Municipal Corporation. In 2017, the municipal corporation planned to construct 33 decentralized compost processing plants at a cost of {{INR}} 109.6 million, each with a capacity to convert 4 tonnes of [[biodegradable waste]] into manure. Of these, 17 plants were operational as of February 2018.<ref>{{cite news
