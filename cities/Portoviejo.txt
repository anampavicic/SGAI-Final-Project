'''Portoviejo''' ({{IPA|es|poɾtoˈβjexo}}), also known as '''San Gregorio de Portoviejo''', is a city in [[Ecuador]], and the capital of the [[Provinces of Ecuador|Province]] of [[Manabí Province|Manabí]] {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} from the [[Pacific]] coast. It is still known as the city of the "Royal [[Tamarind]] Trees" due to former Tamarind plantations in the area.

It serves as the main political and economical centre of the [[Portoviejo River]] valley, which also includes the cantons of [[Santa Ana Canton, Ecuador|Santa Ana]] and [[Rocafuerte Canton|Rocafuerte]], where about {{convert|110|km2|sqmi|abbr=in}} are cultivated every year.

The city, which was affected by economic crisis in the eighties and nineties, is now recovering but severe budget limitations and a huge unemployment rate present difficulties for local authorities.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Portoviejo guide, travel destinations & best time to visit {{!}} Ecuador |url=https://www.ecuador.com/regions/costa-coastline/portoviejo/ |access-date=2022-09-29 |website=Ecuador.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

Founded on March 12, 1535, it is one of the oldest cities in Ecuador and is the eighth largest of the country.

Portoviejo is important for the cultivation of [[coffee]], cattle and fishing and has a thriving agricultural-processing industry, with good road connections to [[Quito]] and [[Guayaquil]].

==History==
Founded March 12, 1535, near the coast, by the Spanish captain Francisco Pacheco as "Villa Nueva de San Gregorio de Portoviejo", it was moved inland to its present site in 1628 due to Indian attacks.

On April 16 and 17, 2016, a large [[2016 Ecuador earthquake|earthquake]] with a moment magnitude of 7.8 struck the region. Portoviejo sustained over 300 fatalities and building damage.<ref>{{cite news | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/world/americas/ecuador-earthquake-deaths.html | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | date = April 17, 2016 | access-date = April 17, 2016 | title =Ecuador Earthquake Kills Hundreds in Huge Wave of Collapses | last1 = Ayala | first1 = Maggie | last2 = Casey | first2 = Nicholas }}</ref>

==Gastronomy==
The city has a rich agricultural and maritime industry, employing over 50% of the population, as well as a flourishing gastronomic sector. The gastronomic sector is now regarded as the main post-disaster, referring to the 2016 earthquake, cultural industry, providing employment opportunities and reducing poverty for local inhabitants.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Portoviejo {{!}} Creative Cities Network |url=https://en.unesco.org/creative-cities/portoviejo |access-date=2022-09-29 |website=en.unesco.org}}</ref>

In 2018, Portoviejo's gastronomy was declared as intangible heritage of Ecuador, a certificate granted by the Ministry of Culture and Cultural Heritage on October 18, 2018, to commemorate the 198 years of independence of Portoviejo.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sandoval |first=Carla |date=22 October 2018 |title=Cocina tradicional manabita declarada Patrimonio Cultural Inmaterial |url=https://www.elcomercio.com/actualidad/cultura/cocina-manabita-patrimonio-cultural-inmaterial.html |access-date=2022-09-29 |website=El Comercio |language=es-EC}}</ref>

In October 2019, the flavor of the Manabi capital was recognized as part of the Creative Cities Network, by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Portoviejo received this recognition when World Cities Day was commemorated, as reported by the Municipal Autonomous Decentralized Government of Portoviejo. The inhabitants of Manabi recover their culture, through gastronomy and the conservation of ancestral recipes; points considered to be part of the Creative Cities, in the Gastronomy category. Portoviejo is the first city in Ecuador to obtain this recognition.<ref name=":0" />

Among the main ingredients used in portovejense food are peanuts, bananas, cheese, corn, and yucca.

A typical meal might consist of Biche de Pescado, Shrimp, Corviche, [[Tacacho|Bolón de verde]], [[Encebollado]], Cebiche de Pollo, Aguado de gallina, or Cangrejada among others.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Portoviejo has a [[semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSh'') with consistently very warm to hot conditions all year round. The advance and retreat of the cold [[Humboldt Current]] means there are two seasons: a lengthy [[dry season]] from May to December and a short [[wet season]] from January to April. The wet season is quite erratic owing to the [[El Niño Southern Oscillation]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dewar|first1=Robert E|last2=Wallis|first2=James R|title=Geographical patterning of interannual rainfall variability in the tropics and near tropics: An L-moments approach|journal=[[Journal of Climate]]|volume=12|issue=12|pages=3457–3466|bibcode=1999JCli...12.3457D|year=1999|doi=10.1175/1520-0442(1999)012<3457:GPOIRV>2.0.CO;2|s2cid=55652367 |doi-access=free}}</ref> in [[El Niño]] years rainfall may be several times the long-term mean.
