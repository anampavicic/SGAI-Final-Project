'''Tuaran''' ({{langx|ms|Pekan Tuaran}}) is the capital of the [[Tuaran District]] in the [[West Coast Division]] of [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]]. Its population was estimated to be around 128,200 in 2019<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/population/04Jadual_PBT_negeri/PBT_Sabah.pdf|title=Population by ethnic group, Local Authority area and state, Malaysia|publisher=Department of Statistics, Malaysia|year=2010|access-date=5 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227090315/http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/population/04Jadual_PBT_negeri/PBT_Sabah.pdf|archive-date=27 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> with half the population consists of ethnic [[Dusun people|Dusuns]], most of the [[Lotud]] ethnic subgroup as well of [[Bajau people|Bajau]] descent. The remainder is mostly of the [[Malaysian Chinese]] community, particularly from the [[Hakka people|Hakka]] subgroup and Malay. The town is bordered on three sides by the [[Tuaran River]]. It is located {{convert|34|km}} north of the state capital [[Kota Kinabalu]], and is strategically situated along the main highway linking Kota Kinabalu with the north of Sabah.

== Etymology ==
The existence of Tuaran in colonial records can be traced as far back as 1813, in official letters written by [[Stamford Raffles|Sir Stamford Raffles]], the then British Governor of Java, seeking permission to accept the Sultan of Brunei's invitation to deal with piracy issues at 'Jawaran' in the north of Borneo.

'Jawaran' is a corruption of the [[Malay language|Malay]] word ''tawaran''. ''Tawaran'' has two meanings; the first meaning is 'fresh water', referring to the importance of the Tuaran area as a source of freshwater for the locality. The second meaning is 'to bargain', which refers to the trading activities which had been taking place in the Tuaran area even before British colonisation commenced in 1884.<ref>"Colonial Townships in Sabah: West Coast, 2012: Sabah", ''PAM Sabah Chapter, City Top Enterprise Sdn Bhd & Colourcoil Industries Sdn Bhd''.</ref>

Another consideration is Tuaran came from word 'taaran' which mean river by [[Dusun people|Dusun]] ethnic.

The [[Dusun]] [[Lotud]] people of Tuaran produce a traditional liquor called ''bahar'' ([[Palm wine|toddy]]) made from coconut sap mixed with a kind of tree bark known locally as ''rosok'' which colours the sap red.

[[File:Mi Tuaran.jpg|thumb|right|Tuaran mee.]]
''Tuaran mee'' ([[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional Chinese]]: 鬥亞蘭面; [[Hakka language|Hakka]]: ''Diu ah lan men''), which literally translates as 'Tuaran noodles', is a noodle dish created by the Hakka Chinese community of Tuaran. The noodles are made from a batter consisting of egg yolk and flour. They are fried for five to ten minutes in high heat, causing the bottom part of the noodles to become crunchy. Local vegetables are added during frying. Before ''Tuaran mee'' is served, it is usually garnished with slices of sweetened Chinese roast pork (Traditional Chinese: 叉燒; Hakka: ''cha sau'') and fried egg rolls (Traditional Chinese: 春捲; Hakka: ''chun kien'').
