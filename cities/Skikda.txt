'''Skikda''' ({{langx|ar|ÿ≥ŸÉŸäŸÉÿØÿ©}}; formerly '''Philippeville'''<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Philippeville |volume=21 |page=390}}</ref> from 1838 to 1962 and '''Rusicade'''<ref name=EB1911/> in ancient times) is a city in northeastern [[Algeria]] and a port on the [[Mediterranean]]. It is the capital of [[Skikda Province]] and [[Skikda District]].

==History==
[[File:Philippeville - Statue - Mieusement 02.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Statue from Skikda's museum]]
{{further|Maghreb placename etymology}}
The [[Phoenicians]] and [[Carthaginians]] established a trading post and fort named {{sc|r≈°kd}} ({{lang|xpu|ê§ìê§îê§ä‚Ä¨ê§É‚Ä¨}}, "[[Jug]] [[Headland|Cape]]") after Skikda's nearby cape.{{sfnp|Huss|2006}} Falling under [[Roman Republic|Roman]] hegemony after the [[Punic Wars]], the name was [[latinization of names|Latinized]] as '''Rusicade'''<ref name="BoardmanEdwards1992">{{cite book|author1=John Boardman|author2=I.

In [[late antiquity]], the port was destroyed during the [[Vandals]]' invasion of 530. The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] [[Vandalic War|reconquered the region]] in 533 and 534, but left large areas under Berber control. The town [[Islamic conquest of the Maghreb|was overrun]] by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] at the end of the 7th century.

Present-day Skikda was founded by French governor [[Sylvain Charles Val√©e]] in 1838 under the name '''Philippeville''',<ref name=EB1911/> honoring [[Louis Philippe I|the French king]] at the time. The [[July Monarchy|French]] were in the process of [[French Algeria|annexing Algeria]] and developed Philippeville as a port for [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]],<ref name=EB1911/> Algeria's third-largest city. The two cities were [[Algiers-Skikda line|connected by rail]]. The harbour works, with every vessel in port, was destroyed by a storm in 1878; a larger harbour was then built.<ref name=EB1911/> On 10 October 1883, there was an earthquake in Philippeville.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9801E5DF103BE033A25753C1A9669D94629FD7CF|title=Earthquake Shock in Algeria |work=[[New York Times]]|date=10 October 1883}}</ref>

Towards the end of [[World War II]], a [[UNRRA]] refugee camp name ''{{lang|fr|Camp [[Jeanne d'Arc]]}}'' was established near the city. On 25 January 1945, 200 Jews holding citizenship from countries in North and [[South America]] were sent from the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] to Switzerland as part of a prisoner exchange group. They were later sent to the UNRRA camp in Skikda.<ref>[http://www.jewishgen.org/databases/Holocaust/0138_Bergen-Belsen_to_Algeria.html source] Page at Holocaust database</ref>

===Battle of Philippeville===
{{main|Battle of Philippeville}}
An attack by the FLN in 1955 during the war of Independence left around 123 civilians dead, mainly French and those suspected of collaboration.<ref>Ben Abro, ''Assassination! July 14'', University of Nebraska Press (2001), p251</ref> Angered over the massacre of civilians, including women, seniors, and babies, the French escalated their offensive against the FLN. Reprisals by French forces may have killed between 1,200 (according to French sources,) and 12,000 civilians (according to the FLN.)

===1989 shipping disaster===
The city has a commercial harbour with a gas and oil terminal. On 15 February 1989 the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] tanker the [[Maassluis (ship)|MV ''Maassluis'']] was anchored just outside the port, waiting to dock the next day at the terminal, when [[extreme weather]] broke out. The ship's anchors did not hold and the ship smashed on the pier-head of the port. The disaster killed 27 of the 29 people on board.<ref>Website Nieuwsdossier on [http://www.nieuwsdossier.nl/dossier/1989-02-15/Tanker+Maassluis+gezonken+nabij+Skikda Sinking of Maassluis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503024203/http://www.nieuwsdossier.nl/dossier/1989-02-15/Tanker+Maassluis+gezonken+nabij+Skikda |date=3 May 2011 }}, retrieved 3 August 2010</ref>

==Modern Skikda==
The city has a population of 250,000. [[Natural gas]], [[oil refining]], and [[petrochemical]] industries were developed in the 1970s and pipelines have been built for their transportation. The city hall (a neo-moorish style palace) and the railroad station were designed by [[Le Corbusier]].

The official city flag colours are blue and white, the colours of the Mediterranean. The current postal code is 21000. Skikda has the third largest commercial port in Algeria after [[Algiers]] and [[Oran]]. It has also a petrochemical terminal port and a smaller fishing port in [[Stora]], and there are many beaches along the natural [[Mediterranean]] coastline. There is also a closed airport near the petrochemical complex.

==Geography==
[[File:Atlantis seen over the Mediterranean Sea, near the Algerian coast.jpeg|thumb|left|Skikda under [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'']], November 2009]]
Skikda lies on the coast of the [[Gulf of Stora]], part of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The landscape is hilly and forested, with high ridges on both the western and eastern sides of the city.

===Climate===
Skikda has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K√∂ppen climate classification]] ''Csa''), with cool, wet winters and very warm, dry summers.

==Economy==

Historically, Skikda is known for its seaport. It was described, in 1911, by [[Baedeker]] as having "the youngest Algerian [[seaport]]."<ref name="WDL">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8816/ |title = Philippeville, Algeria |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1899 |access-date = 26 September 2013 }}</ref><br>
On 19 January 2004, a fire and explosion at the Skikda LNG facility killed 29 people and caused $940,000,000 worth of damage.  The accident incapacitated three LNG trains and impacted approximately 2% of the world's liquefaction capacity. The explosion was preceded by the ingestion of a sizable leak of cold hydrocarbon into the boiler of the westernmost LNG line. This caused the boiler to explode. According to the 2014 Marsh report into the world's largest industrial disaster, the Skikda explosion is ranked No. 3 in the hydrocarbon industry.

==Transportation==
[[File:Skikda Station.jpg|right|thumb|Skikda Railway Station]]
The main road from Skikda is the N3 to [[El Arrouch]], [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]], [[Batna, Algeria|Batna]], [[Biskra]] and [[Touggourt]]. Smaller local roads lead to the towns of [[Stora, Algeria|Stora]] (to the northwest along the coast), [[Beni Bechir]] (to the south), [[Bissy, Algeria|Bissy]] and [[Azzaba, Algeria|Azzaba]] (to the southeast), and [[El Mersa]] and [[Chetaibi]] (to the east).

Skikda is the terminus of the [[Algiers-Skikda line]] ‚Äì one of the [[SNTF]] mainline railroads, although most passenger and cargo services branch off in nearby [[Ramdane Djamel]] (towards the [[Ramdane Djamel-Annaba line|Ramdane Djamel-Annaba]] or [[Ramdane Djamel-Jijel line]]s before reaching Skikda). The city is served by  [[Skikda Airport]], although this airport is currently unused.
