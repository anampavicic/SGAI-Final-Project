'''Ryazan''' ({{langx|ru|Рязань}}, {{IPA|ru|rʲɪˈzanʲ|IPA|ru-Ryazan.ogg}}; also Riazan) is the largest [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] and [[administrative center]] of [[Ryazan Oblast]], [[Russia]]. The city is located on the banks of the [[Oka River]] in [[Central Russia]], {{cvt|196|km|sp=us}} southeast of [[Moscow]]. As of the 2010 Census, Ryazan had a population of 524,927, making it the [[List of cities and towns in Russia by population|33rd most populated city in Russia]], and the fourth most populated in [[Central Federal District|Central Russia]] after Moscow, [[Voronezh]], and [[Yaroslavl]].{{Historical populations|1897|46122|1926|48989|1939|95357|1959|214130|1970|350151|1979|453267|1989|514638|2002|521560|2010|524927|2021|528599|type=|footnote=Source: Census data}}An older city, now known as Old Ryazan ({{Langx|ru|Старая Рязань|Staraya Ryazan}}), was located {{convert|50|km}} east of modern-day Ryazan during the late [[Middle Ages]], and served as capital of the [[Principality of Ryazan]] up until the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'|Mongol invasion]] in 1237. During the [[Siege of Ryazan]], it became one of the first cities in Russia to be besieged and completely razed to the ground. The capital was subsequently moved to Pereyaslavl-Ryazansky ({{Langx|ru|Переяславль-Рязанский}}), and later renamed to Ryazan by order of [[Catherine the Great]] in 1778.<ref>{{Cite web |title=5.

The city is known for the [[Ryazan Kremlin]], a historic museum; the [[Pozhalostin Museum]], one of the oldest art museums in Russia; the Memorial Museum-Estate of Academician [[Ivan Pavlov|I.P. Pavlov]]; and the [[Ryazan Museum of Long-Range Aviation]].

In 2022, the Ministry of Construction published an updated rating of the new urban digitalization index. Ryazan entered the top three cities with a population of 250 thousand to a million people.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Назаров Александр Юрьевич рассказал об инновационных разработках Ростеха в рамках концепции «Умный город» |url=https://vladtime.ru/computers/750487 |access-date=2023-03-24 |website=ВладТайм - самые независимые новости}}</ref>

==History==
=== Principality of Ryazan ===
{{See also|Principality of Ryazan}}
[[File:Old map of Ryazan.jpg|thumb|left|Old map of Ryazan (1909)]]

The first written mention of the city, under the name of '''Pereslavl''', dates to 1095. The city became part of the independent [[Principality of Ryazan]], which had existed since 1129, centered on the old city of Ryazan. The first ruler of Ryazan was supposedly [[Yaroslav Sviatoslavich]], Prince of [[Ryazan and Murom]] (cities of [[Kievan Rus']]).{{Cn|date=July 2024}}

==== Invasion by Mongols ====
{{further|Mongol invasion of Europe}}
In the 12th century, the lands of Ryazan – being located on the border between woodlands and the [[steppe]] – suffered numerous invasions from the southern and northern parts of European Russia. Southern invasions were usually carried out by the [[Cuman]]s; on the northern side Ryazan was in conflict with [[Vladimir-Suzdal]], who by the end of the 12th century had burnt the capital of Ryazan several times.

In the 13th century, Ryazan was the [[Siege of Ryazan|first Russian city to face Mongolian invasion]] by the hordes of [[Batu Khan]]. On December&nbsp;21, 1237, after a short siege, it was [[The Tale of the Destruction of Ryazan|completely destroyed]] and never recovered. As a result of the takeover, the seat of the principality was moved about {{cvt|55|km|sp=us}} to the town of Pereslavl-Ryazansky, which subsequently took the name of the destroyed capital. The site of the old capital now carries the name of '''Staraya Ryazan''' (''Old Ryazan''), close to [[Spassk-Ryazansky]]. Maps of the 16th-18th centuries show Ryazan (Old Ryazan) and Pereslavl-Ryazan together.<ref>{{cite book |last=Zatta |first=Antonio |title=Governi di Moscovia e Woronez colle loro Provincie Nella Russia Europea Di nuova Projezione. |date=1782}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Jaillot |first=Alexis-Hubert |title=LA RUSSIE BLANCHE ou MOSCOVIE : Diviseé Suivant l'Estendue DES ROYAUMES, DUCHES, PRINCIPAUTES PROVINCES et PEUPLES, qui sont Presentement soubs la Domination DU CZAR DE LA RUSSIE, Cogneu soubs le Nom de GRAND DUC DE MOSCOVIE |date=1674 |isbn=978-9949-644-00-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Яковлев |first=Алексей Иванович |title=Засечная черта Московского государства в XVII веке : очерк из истории обороны южной окраины Московского государства |date=1916 |publisher=книжное издание |location=М. |pages=313, 321 |url=http://elib.shpl.ru/ru/nodes/24454-yakovlev-a-i-zasechnaya-cherta-moskovskogo-gosudarstva-v-xvii-veke-ocherk-iz-istorii-oborony-yuzhnoy-okrainy-moskovskogo-gosudarstva-m-1916}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Martin |first=Kromer |title=Magni Ducatus Lithuaniae, Livoniae et Moscoviae Descriptio : cum privilegio |date=1589 |isbn=978-9949-564-35-4 |url=https://www.digar.ee/arhiiv/nlib-digar:964}}</ref>{{Vague|date={{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}}}

==== Golden Horde ====
[[File:Staraya Ryazan-2.jpg|thumb|Old Ryazan remnants: Cathedral of St. [[Boris and Gleb]].]]
[[File:A-Ryazan Kremlin.jpg|thumb|[[Ryazan Kremlin]]]]

In 1380, during the [[Battle of Kulikovo]], the Grand Prince of Ryazan Oleg and his men came under a coalition of [[Mamai]], a strongman of the Tatar [[Golden Horde]], and the Grand Duke of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], against the armies under the command of the Grand Prince of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], [[Dmitry Donskoy]].

Late in the 13th century, the Princes of Ryazan moved their capital to Pereyaslavl' ({{Langx|ru|Переяславль}}), which is known as Ryazan from the 16th century (officially renamed in 1778).

The principality was finally dissolved and incorporated into the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] in 1521. The principality's last duke, [[Ivan V of Ryazan]], was imprisoned for a short time for being suspected in a treasonous attempt to seal a treaty with [[Crimean Khanate]] in order to outweigh Moscow's influence. The duke fled to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania where he died no later than 1534.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Присоединение к Москве Рязани и Северской земли |trans-title=Annexation of Ryazan and Northern lands to Moscow |url=http://rushist.com/index.php/russia-children/770-prisoedinenie-k-moskve-ryazani-i-severskoj-zemli |access-date=2021-11-02 |website=rushist.com |publisher=Russian Historical Library}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=ИВАН ИВАНОВИЧ (РЯЗАНСКИЙ КНЯЗЬ ) |trans-title=Ivan Ivanovich, Duke of Ryazan |url=https://w.histrf.ru/articles/article/show/ivan_ivanovich |access-date=2021-11-02 |website=w.histrf.ru}}</ref> 

Being the southernmost border of Rus' lands at the time, Ryazan continued to suffer from invasions of [[Crimean Tatars]] and their allies.

==== Time of Troubles ====
{{Main|Time of Troubles}}{{See also|Polish–Muscovite War (1605–1618)}}
In June of 1605 Ryazan became a seat for [[Greek Cypriot]]-born [[Ignatius of Moscow|Patriarch Ignatius]], a [[clergyman]] who was sent by [[Russian Orthodox Church]] to serve as an [[archbishop]] of Ryazan.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Русские патриархи - Андрей Петрович Богданов |url=http://krotov.info/history/17/1/bogdanov_02.htm |access-date=2021-11-07 |website=krotov.info}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2013-06-06 |title=Патриарх Игнатий (1605-1606 гг.) - Учреждение Патриаршества - Патриарший Период (1586-1700) - Очерки по истории Русской Церкви.

Around that time Ryazan ex-duchy became a home for various noble families, most notable of which are Lyapunovs, whose brothers [[Prokopy Petrovich Lyapunov|Prokopy]] and [[Zakhary Lyapunov|Zakhary Lyapunovs]] played a significant roles in shaping Russian history during Times of Troubles.

During [[World War II]], Ryazan was repeatedly bombed by German [[Luftwaffe]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=В 30 километрах от линии фронта: чем жила Рязань в годы войны |trans-title=Within 30 Kilometers of Frontline: How Ryazan Lived Through War |url=https://progorod62.ru/news/15853 |access-date=2022-01-12 |website=progorod62.ru |language=ru}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Война: Рязанская область 1941 – 1945 гг |trans-title=War: Ryazan Oblast during 1941–1945 |url=https://regnum.ru/news/2940635.html |access-date=2022-01-12 |website=ИА REGNUM |language=ru}}</ref> Immediately after the war, rapid development of the city began, and it became a major industrial, scientific, and military center of the European part of Russia.<ref name=":0"/><ref name=":2">{{Cite web |date=2013 |title=Атлас Регионов: Рязанская область |trans-title=Atlas of Regions: Ryazan Oblast |url=http://www.ecoross.ru/files/atlas/ryazan.shtml |access-date=2022-01-13 |website=www.ecoross.ru |publisher=[[Moscow State University]]}}</ref> On October 19, 1960 a [[Oil refinery|petroleum refinery]] produced its first gasoline.<ref>{{Cite web |date=January 2022 |title=АО «Рязанская нефтеперерабатывающая компания» |url=https://rnpk.rosneft.ru/about/Glance/OperationalStructure/Pererabotka/rnpk/}}</ref>

Ryazan housed the USSR's only producer of potato-harvesting equipment at the time. Ryazselmash factory ({{Langx|ru|Рязсельмаш|lit=Ryazan Countryside Machines}}), an accounting machines plant, and a heavy forging equipment plant, among others, were also built.<ref name=":2" />

Because of the city's industrialization, Ryazan Oblast's share of workers employed in the agrarian sector shifted into the industrial sector.<ref name=":2" />

Ryazan was developed as a military center, and became the main training center of the [[Soviet Airborne Forces]]. Several positioned [[man-portable air-defense system]]s protect the urban sky. Besides the Airborne School (at the time named after [[Kliment Voroshilov]]<ref name=":0"/>), Ryazan has the Automobile School and Institute of Communications, a regiment of [[Russian Railway Troops|railway troops]], airbase strategic bombers, and a training center in Diaghilev.

Ryazan developed particularly rapidly while Nadezhda Nikolaevna Chumakova served as Chair of the Council of People's Deputies of Ryazan and Ryazan mayor. Under Chumakova, the city's population increased from 72,000 to 520,000. Chumakova oversaw the construction of social and cultural amenities, more than 20 urban areas, and hundreds of kilometers of trolleybus, tram and bus routes. Landscaping became a fundamental strategy for the development of the city at that time. A "green" ring of forests, parks, and garden associations surrounded Ryazan, with large parks located in each area of the city, and compositions of flowers and vertical gardening became customary, not only for the main streets, but also for industrial zones and factory buildings. Ryazan repeatedly won recognition among the cities of the Soviet Union for its landscaping. During her 26 years in office, Chumakova often accepted awards of the [[Red Banner]] of the USSR on behalf of Ryazan.

{{Update|section|date=October 2024}}

By the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, more than half of the city's GDP was being exported into its [[satellite state]]s. In the 1990s, Ryazan experienced significant economic troubles as part of the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]], with many ex-Soviet and newly established companies going bankrupt by the end of the decade.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Рязанская кинофабрика: триллер продолжается |url=https://mediaryazan.ru/articles/detail/164658.html |access-date=2022-01-12 |website=mediaryazan.ru |language=ru}}</ref> In September 1999, Ryazan suffered a series of attempted [[Russian apartment bombings|apartment bombings]] (see [[#Ryazan Incident|Ryazan Incident]] below).

Ryazan, like many cities in Russia after the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]], saw a rise in crime during the 1990s. {{Interlanguage link|Слоновская ОПГ|lt=Slonovskaya organized criminal group|ru}} ({{langx|ru|Слоновская ОПГ}}) (Slony for short), one of the [[Russian mafia|largest gangs]] in Russia, managed to [[monopolize]] the [[downtown]] area and the [[criminal underworld]] of Ryazan. The name is literally translated as "Elephants", after one of its leaders' height and power: Vyacheslav Ermolov Evgenievich (born 1962) nicknamed "Elephant". Before his criminal career started he was a taxi driver. The other leader was a personal driver of the vice prosecutor of the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ermolov, Vyacheslav Evgenievich (Elephant): photo, biography |url=https://garynevillegasm.com/zakon/101435-ermolov-vyacheslav-evgenevich-slon-foto-biografiya.html |access-date=2022-01-10 |website=garynevillegasm.com}}</ref>

In 1991, the gang became heavily involved in the [[racketeering]] of newly-[[privatized]] industries, motor vehicle sales, [[real estate]], [[contract killings]] in other regions, participated in [[gang violence]], [[kidnapping]]s, and committed at least one armed attack on rivals which left eight or ten dead in November of 1993.<ref>{{Cite web |title=#Rodina RP {{!}} [RP Bio] Vyacheslav_Ermolov {{!}} [NEW] |url=https://forum.rodina-rp.com/threads/84212/ |access-date=2021-08-07|website=Форум – Rodina RolePlay|language=ru-RU}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Вспоминая «лихие 90-е»: расстрел в баре «Сельмаша» |url=https://mediaryazan.ru/articles/detail/61267.html |access-date=2022-01-10 |website=mediaryazan.ru |language=ru}}</ref>

This situation continued up until 1996 when local law enforcement managed to apprehend some suspects linked to the gang. By 2000 the gang was almost completely eliminated. Some members were either sentenced to jail or were on the run.<ref>{{cite web |date=January 18, 2004 |title=ЗАПЛЕЧНЫХ ДЕЛ ОПЕРА.

Provotorova held powerful positions in the city for eight years, and, according to local authorities, was associated with the activities of the Slony gang.

Besides Slony, there were two other powerful criminal groups which rivaled Slony and were active in 1996-2001: {{Ill|Осокинская организованная преступная группировка|lt=Osokyn's gang|ru}} and {{Interlanguage link|Айрапетовская организованная преступная группировка|lt=Airapetov's gang|ru}}.
