Fujian is bordered by [[Zhejiang]] to the north, [[Jiangxi]] to the west, [[Guangdong]] to the south, and the [[Taiwan Strait]] to the east. Its capital is [[Fuzhou]] and its largest prefecture city by population is [[Quanzhou]], other notable cities include the port city of [[Xiamen]] and [[Zhangzhou]]. Fujian is located on the west coast of the [[Taiwan Strait]] as the closest geographically and culturally to [[Taiwan]]. Certain islands such as [[Kinmen]] are only approximately 10&nbsp;km (6.2&nbsp;mi) east of [[Xiamen]] in Fujian.

While the population predominantly identifies as [[Han Chinese|Han]], it is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse provinces in China. The dialects of the language group [[Min Chinese]] were most commonly spoken within the province, including the [[Fuzhou dialect]] and [[Eastern Min]] of Northeastern Fujian province and various [[Southern Min]] and [[Hokkien]] dialects of southeastern Fujian. The capital city of [[Fuzhou]] and Fu'an of [[Ningde]] prefecture along with [[Cangnan County|Cangnan]] county-level city of [[Wenzhou]] prefecture in [[Zhejiang]] province make up the Min Dong linguistic and cultural region of Northeastern Fujian. [[Hakka Chinese]] is also spoken, by the [[Hakka people]] in Fujian. Min dialects, Hakka and [[Standard Chinese]] are mutually unintelligible. Due to emigration, a sizable amount of the ethnic Chinese populations of Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines speak [[Southern Min]] (or Hokkien).

With a population of 41.5 million, Fujian ranks [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by population|15th in population]] among Chinese provinces. In 2022, Fujian's GDP reached CN¥5.31 trillion (US$790 billion by nominal GDP), ranking 4th in [[East China]] region and [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP|8th]] nationwide in GDP.<ref name="data2022"/> Fujian's GDP per capita is above the national average, at {{CNY|126,829}} ({{US$|18,856}} in nominal), the second highest [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|GDP per capita of all Chinese provinces]] after [[Jiangsu]].<ref name="data2022"/> It has benefited from its geographical proximity with Taiwan. As a result of the [[Chinese Civil War]], a small proportion of [[#History|Historical Fujian]] is now within the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (ROC, Taiwan). The [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian province of the ROC]] consists of three offshore archipelagos, namely the [[Kinmen|Kinmen Islands]], the [[Matsu Islands]], and the [[Wuqiu, Kinmen|Wuqiu Islands]].

Fujian is considered one of China's leading provinces in education and research. As of 2023, two major cities in the province ranked in the top 45 cities in the world (Xiamen 38th and Fuzhou 45th) by scientific research output, as tracked by the [[Nature Index]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Leading 200 science cities {{!}} Nature Index 2023 Science Cities {{!}} Supplements {{!}} Nature Index |url=https://www.nature.com/nature-index/supplements/nature-index-2023-science-cities/tables/overall |access-date=2023-11-22 |website=www.nature.com |language=en}}</ref>

== Name ==
The name ''Fujian'' ({{lang|zh-CN|福建}}) originated from the combination of the city names of Fuzhou ({{lang|zh-CN|福州}}) and nearby [[Jianzhou (Fujian)|Jianzhou]] ({{lang|zh-CN|建州}}, or present-day [[Nanping]] ({{lang|zh-CN|南平}})).

==History==
{{More citations needed|section|date=February 2024}}

===Prehistoric Fujian===
Recent archaeological discoveries in 2011 demonstrate that Fujian had entered the [[Neolithic Age]] by the middle of the 6th millennium BC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rolett, Barry V.; Zheng, Zhuo; Yue, Yuanfu|date=April 2011|title=Holocene sea-level change and the emergence of Neolithic seafaring in the Fuzhou Basin (Fujian, China)|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=30|issue=7|pages=788–797|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2011.01.015|bibcode=2011QSRv...30..788R}}</ref> From the Keqiutou site (7450–5590 BP), an early Neolithic site in [[Pingtan Island]] located about {{convert|70|km}} southeast of Fuzhou, numerous tools made of stones, [[Exoskeleton|shell]]s, [[bone]]s, [[jade]]s, and [[ceramic]]s (including wheel-made ceramics) have been unearthed, together with [[spinning wheel]]s, which is definitive evidence of [[weaving]].

The Tanshishan ({{lang|zh-hant|曇石山}}) site (5500–4000 BP) in suburban Fuzhou spans the Neolithic and [[Chalcolithic]] Age where semi-underground circular buildings were found in the lower level. The Huangtulun ({{lang|zh-hant|黃土崙}}) site ({{Circa|1325 BC}}), also in suburban Fuzhou, was of the [[Bronze Age]] in character.

Tianlong Jiao (2013)<ref name="Jiao2013">Jiao, Tianlong. 2013. "The Neolithic Archaeology of Southeast China." In Underhill, Anne P., et al. ''A Companion to Chinese Archaeology'', 599-611. Wiley-Blackwell.</ref> notes that the [[Neolithic]] appeared on the coast of Fujian around 6,000 B.P. During the Neolithic, the coast of Fujian had a low population density, with the population depending on mostly on fishing and hunting, along with limited agriculture.

There were four major Neolithic cultures in coastal Fujian, with the earliest Neolithic cultures originating from the north in coastal [[Zhejiang]].<ref name="Jiao2013"/>
*Keqiutou culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=壳丘头文化}}; {{Circa|6000|5500 BP}}, or {{Circa|4050|3550 BC}})
*Tanshishan culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=昙石山文化}}; {{Circa|5000|4300 BP}}, or {{Circa|3050|2350 BC}})
*Damaoshan culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=大帽山文化}}; {{Circa|5000|4300 BP}})
*Huangguashan culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=黄瓜山文化}}; {{Circa|4300|3500 BP}}, or {{Circa|2350|1550 BC}})

There were two major Neolithic cultures in inland Fujian, which were highly distinct from the coastal Fujian Neolithic cultures.<ref name="Jiao2013"/> These are the Niubishan culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=牛鼻山文化}}) from 5000 to 4000 years ago, and the Hulushan culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=葫芦山文化}}) from 2050 to 1550 BC.

===Minyue kingdom===
{{Main|Minyue}}
[[File:Map of Minyue.png|thumb|left|Map of [[Minyue]]]]
Fujian was also where the kingdom of [[Minyue]] was located. The word "Mǐnyuè" was derived by combining "Mǐn" ({{zh|t=閩 |s=闽 |poj=bân}}), which is perhaps an ethnic name ({{zh|t=蠻 |s=蛮 |p=mán |poj=bân |links=no}}), and "[[Baiyue|Yuè]]", after the [[State of Yue]], a [[Spring and Autumn period]] kingdom in [[Zhejiang]] to the north. This is because the royal family of Yuè fled to Fujian after its kingdom was annexed by the [[State of Chu]] in 306 BC. Mǐn is also the name of the [[Min River (Fujian)|main river]] in this area, but the ethnonym is probably older.

===Qin dynasty===
The Qin deposed the King of Minyue, establishing instead a paramilitary province there called Minzhong Commandery. Minyue was a ''de facto'' kingdom until one of the emperors of the [[Qin dynasty]], the first unified imperial Chinese state, abolished its status.<ref name="Britannica">Britannica</ref>

===Han dynasty===
{{see also|Han campaigns against Minyue}}
In the aftermath of the Qin dynasty's fall, [[Chu–Han Contention|civil war]] broke out between two warlords, [[Xiang Yu]] and [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]]. The Minyue king Wuzhu sent his troops to fight with Liu and his gamble paid off. Liu was victorious and founded the [[Han dynasty]]. In 202 BC, he restored Minyue's status as a [[tributary state|tributary]] independent kingdom. Thus Wuzhu was allowed to construct his fortified city in Fuzhou as well as a few locations in the [[Wuyi Mountains]], which have been excavated in recent years. His kingdom extended beyond the borders of contemporary Fujian into eastern Guangdong, eastern [[Jiangxi]], and southern [[Zhejiang]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200222123322/https://global.britannica.com/place/Fujian#ref591270 Fuijan]. Britannica.com.</ref>

After Wuzhu's death, Minyue maintained its militant tradition and launched several expeditions against its neighboring kingdoms in [[Guangdong]], [[Jiangxi]], and [[Zhejiang]], primarily in the 2nd century BC. This was stopped by the [[Han dynasty]] as it [[Southward expansion of the Han dynasty|expanded southward]]. The Han emperor eventually decided to get rid of the potential threat by launching a [[Han campaigns against Minyue|military campaign]] against Minyue. Large forces approached Minyue simultaneously from four directions via land and sea in 111 BC. The rulers in Fuzhou surrendered to avoid a futile fight and destruction and the first kingdom in Fujian history came to an abrupt end.

Fujian was part of the much larger [[Yang Province]] (Yangzhou), whose provincial capital was designated in Liyang (歷陽; present-day [[He County, Anhui]]).

The [[Han dynasty]] collapsed at the end of the 2nd century AD, paving the way for the [[Three Kingdoms]] era. [[Sun Quan]], the founder of the [[Eastern Wu|Kingdom of Wu]], spent nearly 20 years subduing the Shan Yue people, the branch of the Yue living in mountains.

===Jin era===
The first wave of [[Migration of the eight clans|immigration]] of the noble class arrived in the province in the early 4th century when the [[Western Jin dynasty]] collapsed and the north was torn apart by [[War of the Eight Princes|civil wars]] and [[Upheaval of the Five Barbarians|rebellions by tribal peoples]] from the north and west. These immigrants were primarily from eight families in [[central China]]: {{citation needed span|[[Chen (surname)|Chen]] ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|陈}}), [[Lin (surname)|Lin]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|林}}), [[Huang (surname)|Huang]] ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|黄}}), [[Zheng (surname)|Zheng]] ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|郑}}), [[Zhan (surname)|Zhan]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|詹}}), [[Qiū (surname)|Qiu]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|邱}}), [[He (surname)|He]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|何}}), and [[Hu (surname)|Hu]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|胡}}). To this day, the first four remain the most popular surnames in Fujian.|date=April 2020|reason=}}

Nevertheless, isolation from nearby areas owing to rugged terrain contributed to Fujian's relatively undeveloped economy and level of development, despite major population boosts from northern China during the "barbarian" rebellions. The population density in Fujian remained low compared to the rest of China. Only two [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]] and sixteen counties were established by the Western Jin dynasty. Like other southern provinces such as [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Guizhou]], and [[Yunnan]], Fujian often served as a destination for exiled prisoners and dissidents at that time.

During the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] era, the [[Southern Dynasties]] ([[Liu Song dynasty|Liu Song]], [[Southern Qi]], [[Liang dynasty|Liang]] ([[Western Liang (555–587)|Western Liang]]), and [[Chen dynasty|Chen]]) reigned south of the [[Yangtze River]], including Fujian.

===Sui and Tang dynasties===
{{see also|Early western influence in Fujian}}
During the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] eras a large influx of migrants settled in Fujian.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AIKTj-KgN40C&pg=PA41 | title=The Pan-Pearl River Delta: An Emerging Regional Economy in a Globalizing China | page=41 | isbn=9789629963767 | last1=Yeung | first1=Yue-man | last2=Shen | first2=Jianfa | year=2008 | publisher=Chinese University Press | access-date=October 18, 2020 | archive-date=April 18, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220418015422/https://books.google.com/books?id=AIKTj-KgN40C&pg=PA41 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Britannica"/>

During the Sui dynasty, Fujian was again part of [[Yang Province]].

During the Tang, Fujian was part of the larger [[Jiangnan East Circuit]], whose capital was at [[Suzhou]]. Modern-day Fujian was composed of around 5 prefectures and 25 counties.

The Tang dynasty (618–907) oversaw the next golden age of China, which contributed to a boom in Fujian's culture and economy. Fuzhou's economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang dynasty saw several political upheavals in the Chinese heartland, prompting even larger waves of northerners to immigrate to the northern part of Fujian.

===Five Dynasties Ten Kingdoms===
[[File:Map of Fujian, 957 Eng.png|thumb|Situation of Fujian in 957]]
As the Tang dynasty ended, China was torn apart in the period of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]]. During this time, a second major wave of immigration arrived in the safe haven of Fujian, led by Wang Brothers ([[Wang Chao (Tang dynasty)|Wang Chao]], {{ill|Wang Shengui|zh|王审邽}} and [[Wang Shenzhi]]), who set up an independent [[Min (Ten Kingdoms)|Kingdom of Min]] with its capital in Fuzhou. After the death of the founding king, however, the kingdom suffered from internal strife, and was soon absorbed by [[Southern Tang]], another southern kingdom.<ref>Fukien. (2008). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved December 20, 2008, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/221639/Fujian {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221122424/https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/221639/Fujian |date=February 21, 2009 }}</ref>

Parts of northern Fujian were conquered by the [[Wuyue]] Kingdom to the north as well, including the Min capital Fuzhou.

[[Quanzhou]] city was blooming into a seaport under the reign of the [[Min (Ten Kingdoms)|Min Kingdom]]{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}.{{when|date=January 2015}}<ref name="《伊本・白图泰游记》">{{lang|zh-hans|伊本・白图泰（著）、马金鹏（译），《伊本・白图泰游记》，宁夏人民出版社，2005年}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|script-title=zh:中国网事:千年古港福建"泉州港"被整合改名引网民争议|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2012-04/11/c_111763389.htm|publisher=[[Xinhua News]]|access-date=2014-08-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009074711/http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2012-04/11/c_111763389.htm|archive-date=October 9, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

''[[Qingyuan Jiedushi]]'' was a military/governance office created in 949 by [[Southern Tang]]'s second emperor [[Li Jing (Southern Tang)|Li Jing]] for the warlord [[Liu Congxiao]], who nominally submitted to him but controlled Quan ({{lang|zh|泉州}}, in modern [[Quanzhou]], Fujian) and Zhang ({{lang|zh|漳州}}, in modern [[Zhangzhou]], Fujian) Prefectures in ''de facto'' independence from the Southern Tang state.<ref name=ZZTJ288>''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷288|vol. 288]].</ref> (Zhang Prefecture was, at times during the circuit's existence, also known as Nan Prefecture ({{lang|zh|南州}}).)<ref name=HS483>''[[History of Song (Yuan dynasty)|History of Song]]'', [[:zh:s:宋史/卷483|vol. 483]].</ref> Starting in 960, in addition to being nominally submissive to Southern Tang, Qingyuan Circuit was also nominally submissive to [[Song dynasty|Song]], which had itself become Southern Tang's nominal overlord.<ref name=XZZTJ1>''[[Xu Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:續資治通鑑/卷001|vol. 1]].</ref>

After Liu's death, the circuit was briefly ruled by his biological nephew/adoptive son [[Liu Shaozi]], who was then overthrown by the officers [[Zhang Hansi]] and [[Chen Hongjin]]. Zhang then ruled the circuit briefly, before Chen deposed him and took over.<ref name=HS483/> In 978, with Song's determination to unify Chinese lands in full order, Chen decided that he could not stay ''de facto'' independent, and offered the control of the circuit to Song's [[Emperor Taizong of Song|Emperor Taizong]], ending Qingyuan Circuit as a ''de facto'' independent entity.<ref name=XZZTJ9>''Xu Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:續資治通鑑/卷009|vol. 9]].</ref>

===Yuan dynasty===
After the establishment of the [[Yuan dynasty]], Fujian became part of [[Jiangzhe province]], whose capital was at [[Hangzhou]]. From 1357 to 1366 Muslims in [[Quanzhou]] participated in the [[Ispah Rebellion]], advancing northward and even capturing Putian and Fuzhou before the rebellion was crushed by the Yuan. Afterward, Quanzhou city lost foreign interest in trading and its formerly welcoming international image as the foreigners were all massacred or deported.

Yuan dynasty General [[Chen Youding]], who had put down the Ispah Rebellion, continued to rule over the Fujian area even after the outbreak of the [[Red Turban Rebellion]]. Forces loyal to the eventual Ming dynasty founder [[Zhu Yuanzhang]] (Hongwu Emperor) defeated Chen in 1367.<ref>{{Cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h58hszAft5wC&q=Chen+Youding+red+turban&pg=PR35| title=The Great Ming Code / Da Ming lu| date=September 2012| publisher=University of Washington Press| isbn=9780295804002| access-date=October 18, 2020| archive-date=April 18, 2022| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220418031152/https://books.google.com/books?id=h58hszAft5wC&q=Chen+Youding+red+turban&pg=PR35| url-status=live}}</ref>

===Ming dynasty===
After the establishment of the [[Ming dynasty]], Fujian became a province, with its capital at Fuzhou. In the early Ming era, Fuzhou Changle was the staging area and supply depot of [[Zheng He]]'s [[Treasure voyages|naval expeditions]]. Further development was severely hampered by the [[Hai jin|sea trade ban]], and the area was superseded by nearby ports of [[Guangzhou]], [[Hangzhou]], [[Ningbo]] and [[Shanghai]] despite the lifting of the ban in 1550.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Large-scale piracy by [[Wokou]] was eventually wiped out by the Chinese military.

===Qing dynasty===
The late Ming and early [[Qing dynasty]] symbolized an era of a large influx of refugees and another 20 years of sea trade ban under the [[Kangxi Emperor]], a measure intended to counter the [[Kingdom of Tungning|refuge Ming government]] of [[Koxinga]] in the [[island of Taiwan]].

The sea ban implemented by the Qing forced many people to evacuate the coast to deprive Koxinga's Ming loyalists of resources. This has led to the myth that it was because Manchus were "afraid of water".

Incoming refugees did not translate into a major labor force, owing to their re-migration into prosperous regions of [[Guangdong]]. In 1683, the Qing dynasty conquered Taiwan in the [[Battle of Penghu]] and annexed it into Fujian province, as [[Taiwan Prefecture]]. Many more [[Han Chinese]] then settled in Taiwan. Today, most Taiwanese are descendants of [[Hokkien people]] from Southern Fujian. Fujian and Taiwan were originally treated as one province ([[Fujian-Taiwan-Province]]), but starting in 1885, they split into two separate provinces.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Skinner|first1=George William|last2=Baker|first2=Hugh D.

In the 1890s, the Qing ceded Taiwan to Japan via the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] after the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]. In 1905–1907 Japan made overtures to enlarge its sphere of influence to include Fujian. Japan was trying to obtain French loans and also avoid the [[Open Door Policy]]. Paris provided loans on condition that Japan respects the Open Door principles and does not violate China's territorial integrity.<ref>Seung-young Kim,  "Open Door or Sphere of Influence?: The Diplomacy of the Japanese–French Entente and Fukien Question, 1905–1907."

===Republic of China===
[[File:闽南护法区.png|thumb|Map of the [[Constitution Protection Region of Southern Fujian]]]]
{{see also|Constitution Protection Region of Southern Fujian|Fujian People's Government|Fuchien Province, Republic of China}}
The [[Xinhai revolution]] overthrew the Qing dynasty and brought the province into the rule of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]].

The [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Constitution Protection Region of Southern Fujian]] was established by [[Chen Jiongming]] from 1918 to 1920.

Fujian briefly established the independent [[Fujian People's Government]] in 1933. It was re-controlled by the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in 1934.

Fujian came under a Japanese sea blockade during [[World War II]].

===People's Republic of China===
After the [[Chinese Civil War]], the [[People's Republic of China]] unified the country and took over most of Fujian, excluding the [[Kinmen|Quemoy]] and [[Matsu Island]]s.

In its early days, Fujian's development was relatively slow in comparison to other coastal provinces due to potential conflicts with Kuomintang-controlled Taiwan. Today, the province has the highest forest coverage rate while enjoying a high growth rate in the economy. The GDP per capita in Fujian is ranked 4-6th place among provinces of China in recent years.

Development has been accompanied by a large influx of population from the overpopulated areas to Fujian's north and west, and much of the farmland and forest, as well as cultural heritage sites such as the temples of king Wuzhu, have given way to ubiquitous high-rise buildings. Fujian faces challenges to sustain development{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} while at the same time preserving Fujian's natural and cultural heritage.

==Geography==
[[File:Peak Yunu.jpg|thumb|[[Wuyi Mountains]]]]
[[File:Min River in Nanping.JPG|thumb|[[Min River (Fujian)|Min River]] in [[Nanping]]]]
The province is mostly mountainous and is traditionally said to be "eight parts mountain, one part water, and one part farmland" ({{zh|labels=no|s=八山一水一分田}}). The northwest is higher in altitude, with the [[Wuyi Mountains]] forming the border between Fujian and [[Jiangxi]]. It is the most forested provincial-level administrative region in China, with a 62.96% forest coverage rate in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.forestry.gov.cn/web/article.do?action=readnew&id=201001211031538926 |title=Forestry in Fujian Province |publisher=English.forestry.gov.cn |date=January 21, 2010 |access-date=May 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503195809/http://english.forestry.gov.cn/web/article.do?action=readnew&id=201001211031538926 |archive-date=May 3, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Fujian's highest point is [[Mount Huanggang]] in the Wuyi Mountains, with an altitude of {{convert|2157|m|mi}}.

Fujian faces [[East China Sea]] to the east, [[South China Sea]] to the south, and the [[Taiwan Strait]] to the southeast. The coastline is rugged and has many bays and islands. Major islands include [[Quemoy]] (also known as Kinmen, controlled by the Republic of China), [[Haitan Island]], and [[Nanri Island]]. [[Meizhou Island]] occupies a central place in the cult of the goddess [[Mazu (goddess)|Matsu]], the patron deity of Chinese sailors.

The [[Min River (Fujian)|Min River]] and its tributaries cut through much of northern and central Fujian. Other rivers include the [[Jin River (Fujian)|Jin]] and the [[Jiulong River|Jiulong]]. Due to its uneven topography, Fujian has many cliffs and rapids.

Fujian is separated from Taiwan by the {{convert|180|km|mi}}-wide Taiwan Strait. Some of the small islands in the Taiwan Strait are also part of the province. The islands of [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] are under the administration of the Republic of China.

Fujian contains several [[Fault (geology)|faults]], the result of a collision between the [[Eurasian Plate|Asiatic Plate]] and the [[Philippine Sea Plate]]. The Changle-Naoao and Longan-Jinjiang fault zones in this area have annual displacement rates of 3–5&nbsp;mm. They could cause major earthquakes in the future.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Guo|first1=Jianming|last2=Xu|first2=Shiyang|last3=Fan|first3=Hailong|date=2017-05-05|title=Neotectonic interpretations and PS-InSAR monitoring of crustal deformations in the Fujian area of China|journal=Open Geosciences|volume=9|issue=1|pages=126–132|doi=10.1515/geo-2017-0010|bibcode=2017OGeo....9...10G|issn=2391-5447|doi-access=free}}</ref>

===Railways===
[[File:Fuzhou Train.JPG|thumb|Fuzhou train station]]
Due to Fujian's mountainous terrain and traditional reliance on maritime transportation, railways came to the province comparatively late. The first rail links to neighboring [[Jiangxi]], [[Guangdong]], and [[Zhejiang]] Province, opened respectively, in 1959, 2000, and 2009. As of October 2013, Fujian has four rail links with Jiangxi to the northwest: the [[Yingtan–Xiamen Railway]] (opened 1957), the [[Hengfeng–Nanping Railway]] (1998), [[Ganzhou–Longyan Railway]] (2005) and the high-speed [[Xiangtang–Putian Railway]] (2013). Fujian's lone rail link to Guangdong to the west, the [[Zhangping–Longchuan Railway]] (2000), will be joined with the high-speed [[Xiamen–Shenzhen Railway|Xiamen–Shenzhen Railway (Xiashen Line)]] in late 2013. The Xiashen Line forms the southernmost section of China's [[Southeast Coast High-Speed Rail Corridor]]. The [[Wenzhou–Fuzhou Railway|Wenzhou–Fuzhou]] and [[Fuzhou–Xiamen Railway|Fuzhou–Xiamen]] sections of this corridor entered operation in 2009 and link Fujian with Zhejiang with trains running at speeds of up to {{convert|250|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.

Within Fujian, coastal and interior cities are linked by the [[Nanping–Fuzhou Railway|Nanping–Fuzhou]] (1959), [[Zhangping–Quanzhou–Xiaocuo Railway|Zhangping–Quanzhou–Xiaocuo]] (2007) and [[Longyan–Xiamen Railway]]s, (2012). To attract Taiwanese investment, the province intends to increase its rail length by 50 percent to {{convert|2500|km|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="China Expat City Guide: Dandong">{{cite web|title=China Expat city Guide Dalian|url=http://www.chinaexpat.com/list/88|publisher=China Expat|year=2008|access-date=February 8, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217165854/http://chinaexpat.com/list/88|archive-date=February 17, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Air===
The major airports are [[Fuzhou Changle International Airport]], [[Xiamen Gaoqi International Airport]], [[Quanzhou Jinjiang International Airport]], [[Nanping Wuyishan Airport]], [[Longyan Guanzhishan Airport]] and [[Sanming Shaxian Airport]]. Xiamen is capable of handling 15.75 million passengers as of 2011. Fuzhou is capable of handling 6.5 million passengers annually with a cargo capacity of more than 200,000 tons. The airport offers direct links to 45 destinations including international routes to Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and Hong Kong.<ref name="China Expat City Guide: Dandong"/>

All of the prefecture-level cities except Nanping, Sanming, and Longyan are found along the coast.

These nine prefecture-level cities are subdivided into 84 [[county-level division]]s (31 [[District of China|district]]s, 11 [[county-level cities]], and 42 [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]]). Those are in turn divided into 1,102 [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#Township level|township-level divisions]] (653 [[town of China|town]]s, 233 [[Townships of the People's Republic of China|township]]s, 19 [[ethnic township]]s, and 195 [[Subdistricts of China|subdistrict]]s).

The [[People's Republic of China]] claims five of the six townships of [[Kinmen|Kinmen County]], [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) as a county of the prefecture-level city of [[Quanzhou]].<ref name="statqz">{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/tjbz/tjyqhdmhcxhfdm/2018/35/3505.html|script-title=zh:2018年统计用区划代码和城乡划分代码：泉州市 |language=zh-hans |publisher=[[National Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China]] |date=2018 |access-date=10 August 2019 |quote={{lang|zh-hans|统计用区划代码 名称{...}350527000000 金门县{...} }} }}</ref><ref name="govqz">{{cite web|url=http://www.quanzhou.gov.cn/zfb/zjqz/jzyg/|publisher=Quanzhou People's Government |language=zh-hans|access-date=10 August 2019|script-title=zh:建治沿革|quote={{lang|zh-hans|民国3年7月，金门自思明县析出置县，隶属厦门道。{...}民国22年(1933){...}12月13日，四省分别更名为闽海、延建、兴泉、龙汀。兴泉省辖莆田、仙游、晋江、南安、安溪、惠安、同安、金门、永春、德化、大田、思明十二县 ，治设晋江(今泉州市区)。{...}民国23年7月，全省设立十个行政督察区，永春、德化、惠安属第四行政督察区(专署驻仙游)，晋江、南安、安溪、金门属第五行政督察区(专署驻同安)。民国24年(1935)10月，全省改为7个行政督察区、l市。惠安、晋江、南安、金门、安溪、永春、德化属第四区(专署驻同安)。民国26年4月，南安县治徙溪美。10月，日本侵略军攻陷金门岛及烈屿，金门县政府迁到大嶝乡。{...}民国27年(1938){...}8月，金门县政务由南安县兼摄。{...}民国32年(1943)9月，全省调整为8个行政督察区、2个市。第四区专署仍驻永春，下辖永春、安溪、金门、南安、晋江、惠安等九县。德化改属第六区(专署驻龙岩)。 {...}1949年8月24日，福建省人民政府(省会福州)成立。8、9月间，南安、永春、惠安、晋江、安溪相继解放。9月， 全省划为八个行政督察区。9月9日，第五行政督察专员公署成立，辖晋江、南安、同安、惠安、安溪、永春、仙游、莆田、金门(待统一)等九县。公署设晋江县城(今泉州市区)。10月9日，金门县大嶝岛、小嶝岛及角屿解放。11月24日，德化解放，归入第七行政督察区(专署驻永安县)。  　1950年{...}10月17日，政务院批准德化县划归晋江区专员公署管辖；1951年1月正式接管。至此， 晋江区辖有晋江、南安、同安、安溪、永春、德化、莆田、仙游、惠安、金门(待统一)十县。{...}1955年3月12日，奉省人民委员会令，晋江区专员公署改称晋江专员公署，4月1日正式实行。同年5月，省人民政府宣布成立金门县政府。{...}1970年{...}6月18日，福建省革命委员会决定实行。于是,全区辖有泉州市及晋江、惠安、南安、同安、安溪、永春、德化、金门(待统一)八县。同年12月25日，划金门县大嶝公社归同安县管辖。{...}1992年3月6日，国务院批准，晋江撤县设市，领原晋江县行政区域，由泉州代管。1992年5月1日。晋江市人民政府成立，至此，泉州市计辖l区、2市、6县：鲤城区、石狮市、晋江市、惠安县、南安县、安溪县、永春县、德化县、金门县，(待统一)。}}}}</ref><ref name="xzqhqz">{{cite web |url=http://www.xzqh.org/html/show/fj/9622.html |script-title=zh:泉州市历史沿革 |publisher=XZQH.org |date=14 July 2015 |language=zh-hans |access-date=10 August 2019 |quote={{lang|zh-hans|1949年8月至11月除金门县外各县相继解放，{...}自1949年9月起除续领原辖晋江、惠安、南安、安溪、永泰、德化、莆田、仙游、金门、同安10县外，1951年从晋江县析出城区和近郊建县级泉州市。{...}2003年末，全市总户数1715866户，总人口6626204人，其中非农业人口1696232人（均不包括金门县在内）；}} }}</ref>

In terms of agricultural land, Fujian is hilly and farmland is sparse. [[Rice]] is the main crop, supplemented by [[sweet potato]]es and [[wheat]] and [[barley]].<ref>ukien. (2008).

Fujian leads the provinces of China in [[longan]] production, and is also a major producer of [[lychee]]s and [[tea]]. Seafood is another important product, with [[shellfish]] production especially prominent.

Because of its geographic location with Taiwan, Fujian has been considered the battlefield frontline in a potential war between mainland China and Taiwan. Hence, it received much less investment from the Chinese central government and developed much slower than the rest of China before 1978. Since 1978, when China opened to the world, Fujian has received significant investment from overseas Fujianese around the world, Taiwanese and foreign investment.

[[Minnan Golden Triangle]], which includes [[Xiamen]], [[Quanzhou]], and [[Zhangzhou]], accounts for 40 percent of the GDP of Fujian province.

Fujian province will be the major economic beneficiary of the opening up of [[Three Links|direct transport]] with Taiwan, which commenced on December 15, 2008. This includes direct flights from Taiwan to major Fujian cities such as Xiamen and Fuzhou. In addition, ports in Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Fuzhou will upgrade their port infrastructure for increased economic trade with Taiwan.<ref name="economist.com">{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12818200 | newspaper=The Economist | title=Ever cuddlier | date=December 18, 2008 | access-date=December 20, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113062544/http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12818200 | archive-date=January 13, 2009 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aFZOzHvMdnjY&refer=home | work=Bloomberg | title=China Pledges Loans to Taiwan Firms to Boost Ties (Update2) | date=December 21, 2008 | access-date=March 7, 2017 }}</ref>

Because of its mountainous nature and waves of migration from central China and assimilation of numerous foreign ethnic groups such as maritime traders in the course of history, Fujian is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse places in China. Local dialects can become unintelligible within {{convert|10|km}}, and the regional cultures and ethnic composition can be completely different from each other as well. This is reflected in the expression that "if you drive five miles in Fujian the culture changes, and if you drive ten miles, the language does".<ref name="NYTDialects">French, Howard W.

The seventh subdivision of Min, [[Qiong Wen]], is not spoken in Fujian. [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], another subdivision of spoken Chinese, is spoken around [[Longyan]] by the [[Hakka people]] who live there.

As is true of other provinces, the official language in Fujian is [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], which is used for communication between people of different localities,<ref name="NYTDialects"/> although native Fujian peoples still converse in their native languages and dialects respectively.

Several regions of Fujian have their own form of [[Chinese opera]]. [[Min opera]] is popular around [[Fuzhou]]; [[Gaojiaxi]] around [[Jinjiang City|Jinjiang]] and [[Quanzhou]]; [[Xiangju (Fujian)|Xiangju]] around [[Zhangzhou]]; [[Fujian Nanqu]] throughout the south, and [[Puxianxi]] around [[Putian]] and [[Xianyou County]].

[[Fujian cuisine]], with an emphasis on [[seafood]], is one of the eight great traditions of [[Chinese cuisine]]. It is composed of traditions from various regions, including [[Fuzhou cuisine]] and [[Min Nan cuisine]]. The most prestigious dish is Fotiaoqiang (literally "[[Buddha jumps over the wall]]"), a complex dish making use of many ingredients, including [[shark]] [[fin]], [[sea cucumber (food)|sea cucumber]], [[abalone]] and [[Shaoxing wine]] (a type of [[Chinese alcoholic beverage]]).

Many well-known [[tea]]s originate from Fujian, including [[oolong]], [[Wuyi Yancha]], [[Lapsang souchong]] and [[Fuzhou jasmine tea]]. Indeed, the [[tea processing]] techniques for three major classes of tea, namely, oolong, [[white tea]], and [[black tea]] were all developed in the province. [[Fujian tea ceremony]] is an elaborate way of preparing and serving tea. The English word "tea" is borrowed from Hokkien. [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]] pronounce the word ''chá''.

Nanyin is a popular form of [[music of Fujian]].

[[Fuzhou bodiless lacquer ware]], a noted type of [[lacquer ware]], is noted for using a body of [[clay]] and/or [[plaster]] to form its shape; the body later removed. [[Fuzhou]] is also known for [[Shoushan stone carvings]].

Fujian is home to several tourist attractions, including four UNESCO World Heritage Sites, one of the highest in China.

=== Cultural features ===
The [[Fujian Tulou]] are Chinese rural dwellings unique to the Hakka in southwest Fujian. These 46 buildings<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fujian - My Tours Company |url=https://mytours.company/en/fujian/ |access-date=2023-10-07 |language=en-US}}</ref> were listed by the [[UNESCO]] as one of the [[World Heritage Site]]s in 2008.

[[Gulangyu Island]], [[Xiamen]], is notable for its beaches, winding lanes, and rich architecture. The island is on China's list of National Scenic Spots and is classified as a [[Tourist Attraction Rating Categories of China|5A tourist attraction]] by the [[China National Tourism Administration]] (CNTA). It was listed by the [[UNESCO]] as one of the [[World Heritage Site]] in 2017. Also in Xiamen is the [[South Putuo Temple]].

The [[Guanghua Temple (Putian)|Guanghua Temple]] is a Buddhist temple in [[Putian]]. It was built in the penultimate year of the [[Chen dynasty|Southern Chen dynasty]]. Located in the northern half of the mouth of Meizhou Bay, it is about 1.8 nautical miles from the mainland and faces the Strait of Taiwan to the southeast. Covering an area of six square miles, the island is swathed in luxuriant green foliage. The coastline is indented with over 12 miles of the beach area. Another Buddhist temple, [[Nanshan Temple (Zhangzhou)|Nanshan Temple]] is located in [[Zhangzhou]].

The [[Kaiyuan Temple (Quanzhou)|Kaiyuan Temple]] is a [[Buddhist temple]] in West Street, [[Quanzhou]], the largest in Fujian province, with an area of {{convert|78000|m2|abbr=off}}.<ref>"Kaiyuan Temple".

=== Natural features ===
[[Mount Taimu]] is a mountain and a scenic resort in [[Fuding]]. It offers a grand view of mountains and sea and is famous for its natural scenery including granite caves, odd-shaped stones, cliffs, clear streams, cascading waterfalls, and cultural attractions such as ancient temples and cliff Inscriptions.

The [[Danxia landform]] in [[Taining County|Taining]] was listed by the [[UNESCO]] as one of the [[World Heritage Site]]s in 2010. It is a unique type of [[Petrography|petrographic]] [[geomorphology]] found in [[China]]. Danxia [[landform]] is formed from red-coloured [[sandstone]]s and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]] of largely [[Cretaceous]] age. The landforms look very much like [[karst]] topography that forms in areas underlain by [[limestone]]s, but since the rocks that form danxia are sandstones and conglomerates, they have been called "pseudo-karst" landforms. They were formed by endogenous forces (including [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]]) and exogenous forces (including [[weathering]] and [[erosion]]).

The [[Wuyi Mountains]] was the first location in Fujian to be listed by [[UNESCO]] as one of the [[World Heritage Site]]s in 1999. They are a mountain range in the prefecture of [[Nanping]] and contain the highest peak in Fujian, [[Mount Huanggang]]. It is famous as a natural landscape garden and a summer resort in China.<ref>{{Cite web |last=陈子琰 |title=High-speed railway revives ancient tea road |url=https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202010/13/WS5f85655ea31024ad0ba7e68c.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211206070639/https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202010/13/WS5f85655ea31024ad0ba7e68c.html |archive-date=December 6, 2021 |access-date=2021-12-05 |website=global.chinadaily.com.cn}}</ref>
