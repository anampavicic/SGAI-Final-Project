'''Puebla''' ({{IPA|es|ˈpweβla|-|Puebla123.ogg}} {{langx|en|colony, settlement}}), officially '''Free and Sovereign State of Puebla''' ({{langx|es|Estado Libre y Soberano de Puebla}}), is one of the 31 states that, along with [[Mexico City]], comprise the [[Political divisions of Mexico|Federal Entities]] of [[Mexico]]. It is divided into [[Municipalities of Puebla|217 municipalities]] and its capital is [[Puebla (city)|Puebla City]].

It is located in east-central Mexico and is bordered by the states of [[Veracruz]] to the north and east, [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], [[State of Mexico|México]], [[Tlaxcala]] and [[Morelos]] to the west, and [[Guerrero]] and [[Oaxaca]] to the south. The origins of the state lie in the city of Puebla, which was founded by the Spanish in this valley in 1531 to secure the trade route between [[Mexico City]] and the [[Veracruz, Veracruz|port of Veracruz]]. By the end of the 18th century, the area had become a colonial province with its own governor, which would become the State of Puebla, after the [[Mexican War of Independence]] in the early 19th century. Since that time the area, especially around the capital city, has continued to grow economically, mostly through industry, despite being the scene of a number of battles, the most notable of which being the [[Battle of Puebla]]. Today, the state is one of the most industrialized in the country, but since most of its development is concentrated in Puebla and other cities, many of its rural areas are undeveloped.

Culturally, the state is home to the ''[[china poblana]]'', [[mole poblano]], active literary and arts scenes, and festivals such as [[Cinco de Mayo]], Ritual of Quetzalcoatl, [[Day of the Dead]] celebrations (especially in [[Huaquechula]]) and [[Carnival]] (especially in [[Carnival of Huejotzingo|Huejotzingo]]). It is home to five major indigenous groups: [[Nahuas]], the [[Totonac]]s, the [[Mixtec]]s, the [[Popoloca]]s and the [[Otomi people|Otomi]], which can mostly be found in the far north and the far south of the state.

==Geography==
[[File:NECAXA.JPG|thumb|Lake and mountains in Necaxa]]
The state is in the central highlands of Mexico between the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt|Sierra Nevada]] and the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]]. It has a triangular shape with its narrow part to the north. It borders the states of Veracruz, Oaxaca, Guerrero, Morelos, State of Mexico, Tlaxcala and Hidalgo. The state occupies 33,919&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, ranking 20th of 31 states in size, and has 
4,930 named communities.<ref name="mediofisico">{{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/puebla/regi.htm |title= Medio Fisico |year= 2009 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Puebla |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location= Mexico |language= es |trans-title= Physical Medium |access-date= October 10, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110616191924/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/puebla/regi.htm |archive-date= June 16, 2011 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

===Mountains===
Most of the mountains of Puebla belong to the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. The first is locally called the Sierra Norte del Puebla, entering the state from the northwest and then breaks up into the smaller chains of Sierra de Zacapoaxtla, Sierra de Huauchinango, Sierra de Teziutlán, Sierra de Tetela de Ocampo, Sierra de Chignahuapan and Sierra de Zacatlán, although these names may vary among localities. Some of the highest elevations include Apulco, Chichat, Chignahuapan, Soltepec and Tlatlaquitepec. The highest elevations are the volcanoes [[Pico de Orizaba]] or Citlaltepetl (5,747masl), [[Popocatépetl]] (5,452masl), [[Iztaccíhuatl]] (5,286masl) and [[Matlalcueitl (volcano)|Malinche]] (4,461masl) which are found on the state's borders with Veracruz, Mexico State and Tlaxcala respectively. In the south of the state, the major elevations are the Sierra de Atenahuacán, Zapotitlán, Lomerio al Suroeste and the Sierra de Tehuacán. Dividing much of the state from Veracruz is a small chain of mountains called the Sierra Madre del Golfo.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

The natural geography of the state subdivides into the Huasteco Plateau, Llanuras y Lomeríos zone, Lagos y Volcanes del Anáhuac, Chiconquiaco, Llanuras y Sierras de Querétaro e Hidalgo, Cordillera Costera del Sur, Mixteca Alta, Sierras y Valles Guerrenses, Sierras Centrales de Oaxaca, Sierras Orientales and Sur de Puebla. The Huasteco Plateau and the Llanuras y Lomeríos zone are located in the north and northeast, with the Lagos y Volcanes del Anáhuc in the center and north. Together, they account for over 50% of the state. The east and northeast are occupies by the Chiconquiaco and Llanudras y Sierras de Querétaro e Hidalgo areas and account for about three percent of the state. The Cordillera del Sur and Mixteca Alta are located in the west and southwest covering less than 2.5% of the state. The Sur de Puebla is in the southwest and accounts for 26% of the state. Other southern subregions include the Sierras y Valles Guerrerenses, the Sierras Centrales de Oaxaca and the Sierras Orientales. Together, they account for about 15% of the state.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

===Hydrology===
[[File:Río Petlapa.jpg|thumb|Petlapa River]]
The hydrology of Puebla is formed by three major river systems. One is based on the [[Balsas River]], also known as the Atoyac, which originates with the melting runoff of the Halos, Telapón and Papagayo mountains along with those from the Iztaccihuatl volcano and waters from the Zahuapan River, which enters from Tlaxcala. This river receives further water from tributaries such as the Acateno, Atila, Amacuzac, Molinos and Cohetzala. The river has one major dam called Valsequllo or Manuel Avila Camacho. This river eventually flows west to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The next system empties into the Gulf of Mexico and consists of the [[Pantepec River|Pantepec]], [[Cazones River|Cazones]], [[Necaxa River|Necaxa]], Laxaxalpan, San Pedro/Zun, Zempoala, Apulco, Cedro Viejo, Salteros, Martínez de la Torre and other rivers on the east side of the state. This system has two major dams called the Necaxa and Mazatepec. The third is the closed [[Oriental Basin]], with a large number of small lakes fresh water springs as well as some volcanically heated springs. The best known of these include Chignahuapan, Agua Azúl, Amalucan, Cisnaqullas, Garcicrespo, Almoloya and Rancho Colorado. Lakes include Chapulco, San Bernardino, Lagunas Epatlán, Ayutla, Almoloyan, Alchichica, Pahuatlán, Las Minas, Aljojuca and Tecuitlapa.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

===Climate===
[[File:PiedrasEncimadas90.JPG|thumb|left|Fog in the mountains near Zacatlán]]
Puebla has many different climates owing to its range of altitudes. It has an average temperature of {{convert|16|C|0|abbr=on}} but this varies greatly locally. There is a rainy season from May until October with an overall precipitation of {{convert|801|mm|2|abbr=on}}. The state has eleven different climate zones, but five predominate. The centre and south of the state has a temperate and semi-moist climate, with an average temperature of {{convert|15|C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|858|mm|2|abbr=on}} of rainfall. The southwest has a warm to hot and semi-moist climate with {{convert|830|mm|2|abbr=on}} of precipitation and {{convert|22|C|0|abbr=on}} average temperature. The north is also warm and hot, and additionally very wet; it has a {{convert|22|C|0|abbr=on}} average temperature but with an average rainfall of {{convert|2250|mm|2|abbr=on}}. The southeast is semi-dry with warm and temperate temperatures, having an average temperature of {{convert|22|C|0|abbr=on}} and precipitation of {{convert|550|mm|2|abbr=on}}. The high volcano peaks have a cold climate.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

===Ecosystems===
[[File:Barranca Zacatlán CRC.jpg|thumb|Ravines at Zacatlán]]
The state has three main ecosystems, tropical rainforests, forests in temperate and cold areas, and arid and semi-arid zones.

Tropical forests are divided into moist, semi-moist and dry forests. These can be found in the Huasteca Plateau, Chiconguiaco, Lagos y Volcánes de Anahuac, Sur de Puebla, Cordillera Costera del Sur, Sierras y Valles Guerrerenses, Sierras Orientales, Sierras Centrales de Oaxaca and Mixteca Alta. The most common species include ''[[Ceiba parviflora]], [[Bursera simaruba]], [[Cedrela odorata]], [[Swietenia macrophylla]], [[Spondias mombin]], [[Brosimum alicastrum]], [[Coccoloba barbadensis]], [[Pithecellobium arboreum]], [[Lysiloma divaricatum]], [[Phoebe tampicensis]], [[Acacia coulteri]]'' and ''[[Ficus|Ficus spp.]]'' These forests are also exploited for wood and other products, including traditional handcrafts. Low growing plants are used to feed livestock. Little is known about the ecosystems of these forests, but it is known that these areas are important to the regulation of water in area rivers. Human activity has severely damaged over 32,000 hectares.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

Tropical forests are divided by altitude. Upper forests are characterized by dense vegetation in fairly humid climates. The tree canopy reaches an average height of 15 meters. Not all species are evergreen, with a number losing leaves during the dry season. During the same season, a number of species also flower. For this reason, these forests never completely lose their color. Common species include ''[[Cedrela|Cedrela sp.]], [[Brosimum alicastrum]], [[Heliocarpus|Heliocarpus spp.]], [[Calophyllum brasiliense]], [[Zuelania guidonia]]'' and ''[[Ficus|Ficus spp.]]'' Most forests of this type are located near the borders with Veracruz and Hidalgo. Tropical forests at lower altitudes are found in areas with median temperatures of over 20 C, and annual rainfall of between 800 and {{convert|1200|mm|2|abbr=on}}. These areas often have a dry season of seven or eight months, and many of these forests will lose most or all of their leaves during this time. Common species include ''[[Bursera simaruba]], Lysiloma divaricatum, [[Phoebe tampicensis]], [[Acacia coulteri]], [[Beaucarnea recurvata]], [[Lysiloma acapulcensis]]'' and ''[[Zuelania guidonia]]''.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

Colder [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine–oak forests|pine–oak forests]] can be found in the Huasteca Plateau, [[Sierra de Chiconquiaco]], Lagos de Volcanos de Anáhuac, Sierras Orientales and Sierras Centrales de Oaxaca. These forests mostly consist of pines, [[oak]]s, [[oyamel]] fir and other conifers (''[[Abies religiosa]], [[Pinus pseudostrobus]], [[Pinus attenuata]], [[Pinus ayacahuite]], [[Pinus leiophylla]], [[Pinus patula]], [[Pinus teocote]], [[Quercus|Quercus spp]], [[Quercus rugosa]], [[Alder|Alnus spp]], [[Arbutus|Arbutus spp]], [[Cupressus|Cupressus spp]]'' and ''[[Juniperus|Juniperus spp.]]''). Much of these areas have been extensively logged and some areas are used to farm trees. These trees are used for wood, paper and other wood-derived products. Due to human activity over 107,000 hectares are considered to be severely damaged.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

[[File:ValleyNaupan05.JPG|thumb|left|Pine forest near [[Huauchinango]] in the Sierra Norte]]

Temperate and cold area forests cover just under 22% of the surface of the state with various species of pine accounting for more than 80% of the trees. These are mostly found in the higher elevations of the mountains where the average temperature is around 15C and at heights of between 2,500 and 2,750masl. Above 3,000m ''[[Pinus hartwegii]]'' is dominant. Pine species which are the most economically valuable and include ''[[Pinus montezumae]], [[Pinus pseudostrobus]], [[Pinus ayacahuite]], [[Pinus greggii]], Pinus hartwegii, [[Pinus lawsonii]], [[Pinus leiophylla]], [[Pinus michoacana]], [[Pinus oocarpa]], [[Pinus patula]]'' and ''[[Pinus teocote]]''. The second most common kind of forest is dominated by oyamel fir, often intermingling with pines and oaks. These forests are found at altitudes of between 2,500 and 3,600masl and with an average temperature of between 7 and 15C and annual precipitation of {{convert|1000|mm|2|abbr=on}}. Forests with trees such as ''Juniperus'' spp., ''[[Pseudotsuga|Pseudotsuga spp.]], [[Pseudotsuga menziesii]]'', and ''[[Cupressus lindleyi]]'' can also be found.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

The arid and semi arid area can be found in the Lagos y Volcanes de Anáhuac, Sur de Puebla, Cordillera Costera del Sur, Sierras y Valles Guerrerenses, Sierras Orientales and Sierras Centrales de Oaxaca. Types of vegetation often found includes mesquite, huizachal and agave, with species such as ''Agave'' spp, ''Yuca'' spp, ''[[Opuntia]]'' spp, ''Aristida'' spp., and ''Stipa'' spp. There is no forestry here but a number of plants are used for fibers, waxes, resins, handcrafts, medicine and a number are edible to both humans and livestock. Many of these arid areas subdivide into microclimates depending on minor variations in temperature and precipitation. Some areas, especially dry grasslands, have suffered overgrazing and soil erosion.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

In the south, near Puebla's borders with Oaxaca and Guerrero are dry mountainous areas, some of which are completely devoid of vegetation, similar to African deserts. Other are populated only by the occasional cactus, with those belonging to the ''[[Fouquieria]]'' genus standing out on the landscape. Where there are arroyos, the vegetation changes drastically to include a wide variety of plants packed along a narrow strip. Other areas in this part of the state are semi-arid, home to a variety of plant and bird species.<ref name="mexdesdesierto">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/desierto-bosque-y-selva-puebla.html |title= Desierto, bosque y selva (Puebla)  |work=Mexico Desconocido |location=Mexico City |language=es |trans-title=Desert, forest and rainforest (Puebla) |access-date=October 10, 2010|date= 2010-07-08 }}</ref>

===Natural attractions===
[[File:Paco en el Pico de Orizaba 2.jpg|thumb|View from the summit of Pico de Orizaba]]
Natural attractions in the state include the Bosque Mesófilos de la Sierra Madre Oriental in the north of the state, [[Piedras Encimadas Valley]], [[Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park]], [[La Malinche National Park]], and the [[Pico de Orizaba National Park]].<ref name="rincones5253">Gonzalez, pp. 52–53</ref> The best known wilderness area is the Izta-Popo National park, which the state shares with neighboring [[State of Mexico]]. It is located only {{convert|55|km|0|abbr=on}} west of the state capital and the two often snow covered volcanoes are easily visible from this area, and important to the state culturally. The park is an area protected by the federal government because of its biological diversity and considered to be the "lungs" of the area due to its forests. Access to the park, especially to the volcanoes themselves is more restricted than in the past due to past ecological damage. Even further restrictions are put into place when the Popocatepetl volcano is active. However, the park has numerous hiking and horse paths in the forests that cover the lower elevations. On the slopes, there are many small caves, which in pre-Hispanic times were often used for ceremonies.<ref name="rincones56">Gonzalez, p. 56</ref>

The Sierra Madre Oriental, locally called the Sierra Norte, is a series of rugged mountains covered in abundant vegetation, which has had an isolating effect on the people here over the centuries.<ref name="rincones59">Gonzalez, p. 59</ref> The Valle de Piedras Encimadas (Valley of the Stacked Stones) is located near the town of [[Zacatlán (municipality)|Zacatlán]]. It is really a series of small valleys covering 400 hectares filled with conifer forest. The attraction here are the stone formations which resemble stones stacked one over the other which take on numerous forms. Some have been said to resemble objects such as dogs, elephants, human heads and monsters. Most of the area is only accessible by foot or horseback.<ref name="rincones66">Gonzalez, p. 66</ref>

In the center of the state, just before the land rises to the north to form the Sierra Norte, there is an area called the [[Oriental Basin]] filled with lakes, both with water and dry. The dry lakebeds contain water only during the rainy season, which runs from summer through fall. The two largest are Salado and Totocingo Lakes. The first is seven km long and two km wide and the second is larger. The largest "wet" lakes are Laguna Preciosa, Laguna Quechulac, Laguna de Atexcac and Laguna de Aijojuca.<ref name="rincones8182">Gonzalez, pp. 81–82</ref>

==History==
[[File:Las Bocas Olmec baby-face figurine (Bookgrrrl).jpg|thumb|175px|[[Olmec figurine]] of [[Las Bocas]]]]

===Pre-Hispanic period===
The territory of the state was one of the first in modern Mexico to be inhabited by humans. Most of the earliest settlements have been found in the valley of Tehuacán, with the oldest near the Agujereado Mountain, which dates back to 10,000 BCE. At this site the oldest sample of corn ever found in the world has been found, which dates back to 1500 BCE.<ref name="rincones32">Gonzalez, p. 32</ref> Along with Agujereado Mountain, there are more than 450 prehistoric sites in the Tehuacan Valley alone. Stone tools date to between 6500 and 4900 BCE, and evidence of agriculture to 3500 and 2000 BCE in areas such as [[Aljojuca (municipality)|Aljojuca]], [[Totimiuacan]], [[Cholula, Puebla|Cholula]] and [[Izúcar de Matamoros|Izucar]]. By 900 BCE, there is ample evidence of the cultivation of corn, beans, squash, [[chili pepper]]s and cotton. The rise of city states was established by 700 BCE.<ref name="enchistoria">{{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/puebla/regi.htm |title= Historia |year= 2009 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Puebla |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location= Mexico |language= es |trans-title= History |access-date= October 10, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110616191924/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/puebla/regi.htm |archive-date= June 16, 2011 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

By the [[Mesoamerica]]n period, the area was inhabited by a number of ethnicities. The regions of [[Acatlán de Osorio, Puebla|Acatlán]] and part of [[Chiautla (municipality)|Chiautla]] were dominated by the [[Mixtec]]s. [[Tepexi de Rodríguez (municipality)|Tepexi]] was dominated by the Popolocas. The central part of the state was dominated by the [[Olmec-Xicalancas]] and [[Nahuas]], with strong cultural links to the [[Toltec]]-based culture at Cholula. The north was populated by the [[Totonac]]s, the [[Mazatec people|Mazatec]]s and the [[Otomi peoples|Otomi]], whose cultural center was in [[El Tajín]]. In the 14th century, [[Nonoalca]] ruler Xelhua, came to dominate almost all of the territory of Puebla. In the 15th century, [[Aztec Empire|Aztec domination]] took over the same area and more. Initially, the center and south areas were under the control of [[Tenochtitlan]] with [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]] dominant in the north. Aztec domination continued until the Spanish Conquest.<ref name="enchistoria"/>

The origins of the modern state lie in the founding of the city of Puebla in the Cuetlaxcoapan Valley in 1531 by [[Toribio de Benavente]] and [[Juan de Salmerón]].<ref name="angelopolis">{{cite web |url=http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=4&Itemid=7 |title=Angelópolis |author=Luz Cortés Padilla |publisher=Government of Puebla |location=Puebla, Mexico |date=May 21, 2009 |language=es |trans-title=Angelopolis |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-date=December 19, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219191212/http://puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=4&Itemid=7 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The city was laid out by Hernando de Elgueta, marking out residential areas, commercial areas etc. The city received its royal seal in 1532 but flooding forced the settlement to move across the San Francisco River and start over that same year. The city's (and now state's) seal was granted in 1538.<ref name="sucesos"/> The city of Puebla was created to secure the route between Mexico City and the port of Veracruz, and was initially populated by soldiers and those who made a living by providing shelter and supplies to travelers between the two cities. However, it soon became the economic and cultural center of the valley areas between the [[Valley of Mexico]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf Coast]], as it provided a starting point for Spanish settlement. The area's economy expanded rapidly as many Europeans and indigenous decided to settle permanently, with the settlement of Puebla reaching city status in 1532 with the name of Ciudad de los Angeles.<ref name="rincones33">Gonzalez, p. 33</ref>

[[File:Cuetzalan ig.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Cuetzalan del Progreso]]]]

The [[Franciscans]] were in charge of the evangelization process in the state, starting from 1524, when they founded the monastery of [[Huejotzingo (municipality)|Huejotzingo]]. Between 1540 and 1560, they founded others such as those in [[Tecamachalco (municipality)|Tecamachalco]], [[Quecholac (municipality)|Quecholac]], [[Tecali de Herrera (municipality)|Tecali]], [[Calpan (municipality)|Calpan]], [[Cuautinchán]], [[Zacatlán (municipality)|Zacatlán]], [[Cholula, Puebla|Cholula]], Huaquechula, Tepeaca, [[Tehuacán Municipality|Tehuacán]], [[Xalpa]] and [[Coatepec, Puebla|Coatepec]]. The [[Augustinians]] arrived next, constructing monasteries in [[Chiautla (municipality)|Chiautla]], [[Chietla (municipality)|Chietla]], [[Huatlatlauca (municipality)|Huatlatlauca]], [[Tlapa]], [[Xicotepec (municipality)|Xicotepec]] and [[Papaloticpac]]. The last of the evangelists were the Dominicans, who built monasteries at [[Izúcar de Matamoros]], [[Tepapayeca]], [[Huehuatlán]] and [[Tepexi de Rodríguez (municipality)|Tepexi]]. The bishopric was established in 1526. Initially, the seat was in the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]], but it was eventually moved to [[Tlaxcala]], then to Puebla by 1550. Eventually, its extension included the current states of Tlaxcala and Puebla during much of the colonial period.<ref name="enchistoria"/>

In 1783, the royal government in Spain divided New Spain into "intendencias" or provinces, one of which was centered on the city of Puebla.<ref name="enchistoria"/> The first governor of Puebla was Manuel de Flon, Count of La Cadena.<ref name="sucesos"/> Initially, this intendencia included Tlaxcala, but it was separated out in 1793. Other parts were eventually separated out into other provinces/states such as Mexico, Guerrero and Veracruz.<ref name="enchistoria"/>

===Post-independence===
During the [[Mexican War of Independence]], the city of Puebla remained loyal to the [[viceroy]] in Mexico City, sending troops to defend it at the [[Battle of Monte de las Cruces]] against [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]]. Ecclesiastical authorities in the Cathedral excommunicated insurgent priests and battles took place in Izúcar and Chiautla. Most of the south of the state, especially Izucar and the Sierra Mixteca were firmly in insurgent hands. Control then bypassed the capital and reached the more northern settlements of Tehuacan and [[Atlixco]].<ref name="enchistoria"/><ref name="rincones34">Gonzalez, p. 34</ref> After Independence, the first governor of the state was Carlos García Arriaga in 1821. The first state congress was seated in 1824, with the first state constitution adopted the same year. The new state was divided initially into 21 parts. The Spanish were expelled from the state in 1827. In 1849, the state was reorganized into eight departments and 162 municipalities and again in 1895 with 21 districts and 180 municipalities.<ref name="enchistoria"/>

During the rest of the 19th century, the state developed economically through industry. The first mechanized textile mill was established in 1831, soon followed by 17 others in the city of Puebla. Progress was interrupted by [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna's]] siege of the city in 1845 and two years later when the Americans under [[Winfield Scott|General Winfield Scott]] took the city on their way to Mexico City. The Americans left three years later at the end of the war.<ref name="enchistoria"/>

[[File:BattleofPuebla2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mexican cavalry charge at the Battle of Puebla]]
Much of the rest of the century was occupied with civil strife such as the insurrection of Francisco Ortega against the federal government, the [[Reform War]] and the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French Intervention]]. The last provoked the [[Battle of Puebla]] on 5 May 1862, when 6,000 French troops attacked the forts named Loreto and Guadalupe outside of the city of Puebla, but they were repelled by forces under [[Ignacio Zaragoza]]. Zaragoza died some months after this battle, and he would be later honored by having his name added to that of the city. However, less than a year later, the city would be taken and shortly after, [[Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico]] would be installed. However, his rule would be brief and the French, along with their conservative Mexican allies, were expelled from the state in 1867.<ref name="enchistoria"/><ref name="sucesos"/>

From this time to the Mexican Revolution, a number of important infrastructure projects were undertaken. One was the Puebla-Veracruz rail line in 1873 and the Escuela Normal para Profesores (Teachers’ College) in 1879. In 1907, a hydroelectric plant was built in Necaxa. However, the economic policies of this area caused widespread unrest, beginning with workers’ strikes. Directly against the regime of [[Porfirio Díaz]] was the Club Antireeleccionista (Anti-reelection Club) headed by [[Aquiles Serdán]] in 1909. In November 1910, after long government surveillance, troops attacked the Serdán house in Puebla killing Aquiles and his brother Máximo. For this reason, the state claims one of the first battles of the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref name="enchistoria"/>

===Following the Mexican Revolution===
In 1912, the [[Liberation Army of the South]] or Zapatistas took over a number of communities in the state. In 1914, they were challenged by forces loyal to [[Venustiano Carranza]], which occupied the capital briefly. However, the Zapatistas would hold power for the rest of the war.<ref name="enchistoria"/> Under the [[1917 Constitution of Mexico|1917 Constitution]], the state was reestablished with 222 municipalities.<ref name="sucesos"/> One of the last skirmishes of the war occurred in [[Aljibes, Puebla]] in May 1920 when forces of [[Álvaro Obregón]] attacked those of Carranza as he was headed to Veracruz. Carranza was assassinated in [[Tlaxcalantongo]] in the Sierra Norte de Puebla soon thereafter.<ref name="enchistoria"/>

The 1920s immediately after the war was marked by instability. The governorship changed hands frequently with resistance to whoever was in power from other parts of the state. Despite this, the [[Universidad Autónoma de Puebla|Universidad de Puebla]] was established by [[Maximino Ávila Camacho]] during this decade. True political stability would not come until the governorship of [[Gustavo Díaz Ordaz]] in 1942.<ref name="enchistoria"/>

===Modern times===
Since the Mexican Revolution, the city of Puebla and its suburbs are one of the most industrialized areas in Mexico, with the metropolitan area ranked fourth in size. Its position near both Mexico City and the Gulf coast continues to be an advantage. However, modern development of the city area has been restricted to outside the city center, in order to preserve its traditional look. This historic center was named a World Heritage Site in 1987, with the [[Biblioteca Palafoxiana]] named as part of the [[Memory of the World Programme]] in 2005.<ref name="rincones3536">Gonzalez, pp. 35–36</ref> Today, Puebla's economic development is centered on its capital. This capital is part of the [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]] centered on Mexico City.<ref name="enchistoria"/>

In 1977, the center of the city of Puebla was named a "Zone of Historic Monuments". The same area was later named a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1987. In 1979, Puebla was the scene of one of [[Pope John Paul II]]'s early papal visits outside Italy to Mexico for that year's [[CELAM]] conference over three months after his election and [[papal inauguration]].<ref name="sucesos"/>

In 1998, the state was declared in a state of emergency due to 122 forest fires with affected 2,998 hectares of land over two weeks. Many of the fires were started by fires on agricultural lands and the extremely dry conditions made the fires out of control.<ref name="emergencia">{{cite news |title= Declaran en Puebla estado de emergencia  |author= Clara Ramirez  |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=March 3, 1998 |page=13 |language=es |trans-title=Puebla declared a state of emergency}}</ref>

The 1999 Tehuacán earthquake did major damage to much of state, especially many of its colonial era churches,<ref name="prayer">{{cite news |title= Mexicans See a Call to Prayer In Quake Damage to Churches |author=Julia Preston |newspaper=New York Times |location=New York |date=June 17, 1999 |page=A14}}</ref> and the colonial buildings of the historic center of the city of Puebla.

In the 2000s, organizations such as [[Reporters Sans Frontieres]] (RSF) have accused state governmental officials of restricting and suppressing the press. Some of the threats against reporters have included false arrests and death threats.<ref name="monitoring">{{cite news |title= Mexican government urged to stop press freedom violations by local politicians |newspaper=BBC Monitoring Americas |location=London |date=July 15, 2007 |page=1}}</ref>

More than two years after the [[2017 Puebla earthquake]] when 621 buildings—mostly 16th to 19th-century churches—were damaged in the state, 46 have been restored, 88 are in process, and 380 have not been restored at all.<ref>[https://www.proceso.com.mx/613664/inah-entrampado-reconstruccion-patrimonio-puebla El INAH, entrampado en la reconstrucción del patrimonio en Puebla] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200111190103/https://www.proceso.com.mx/613664/inah-entrampado-reconstruccion-patrimonio-puebla |date=2020-01-11 }} By Gabriela Hernandez, Proceso, Jan 11, 2020</ref>

In 1921, Puebla had the second largest population, after [[Oaxaca]], of purely indigenous people according to the national census. Since then, the official census has eliminated categories for race, counting only those who speak an indigenous language.

This count ranked Puebla as fifth with a total population of 957,650.<ref name="indcensus">{{cite web |url= http://www.houstonculture.org/hispanic/census.html |title=Indigenous Identity in the Mexican Census |author= John P.

The state has five major indigenous ethnic groups: the [[Nahuas]], the [[Totonac]]s, the [[Mixtec]]s, the [[Popoloca]]s and the [[Otomi people|Otomi]].<ref name="perfilsoc"/> The state has two well-defined areas in which indigenous peoples still maintain many ancient traditions, rites, and customs. These two regions are called the Sierra Norte in the north and the Sierra Negra in the south. In these areas, these traditions, and the agriculture they are dependent on, have survived because industrialization has not penetrated the rugged landscape.<ref name="rincones23">Gonzalez, p. 23</ref>

The Sierra Norte, especially the municipalities of [[Cuetzalan]], [[Pahuatlán (municipality)|Pahuatlán]], [[Huehuetlán el Grande]] and [[Teziutlán (municipality)|Teziutlán]], are dominated by the Nahuas, Totonacas and Otomi.

The state was a diverse economic base supporting industries such as textiles, tourism, agribusiness, storage, medical services, furniture making and logistics services in clusters.(promotedor) In 2010, [[Standard & Poor's]] reconfirmed the state's ‘mxA+’ rating with a stable outlook due to the state's finances. The state's economy grew at a rate of 4.5% from 2003 to 2007, above the national average of 3.9%. Since then, economic growth has slowed but less than in other parts of Mexico.

Puebla is a state where migrant workers both head to and leave from.<ref name="gruposetnicos"/><ref name="septimo"/> Most incoming workers are indigenous from the states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, according to a study done by the [[National Indigenous Institute]] and the United Nations. Most of these emigrants are Mixtecs from the south of the state, which head to areas such as Mexico City and the north of the country either seasonally or permanently.<ref name="gruposetnicos"/> Many also head to the United States to work illegally. The migration situation has caused the population to drop in a number of areas in the state. The UN states that the main reason for emigration is the lack of local economic development especially in rural and indigenous areas.<ref name="septimo"/>

===Agriculture and forestry===

===Handicrafts===
[[File:FacadeUriartePuebla.JPG|thumb|[[Uriarte Talavera]] pottery workshop in Puebla, Mexico]]
[[Talavera (pottery)|Talavera pottery]] is the state's best known craft. This pottery is a type of [[maiolica]], which was introduced into Spain by the [[Arab]]s, and into Mexico by the Spanish. Talavera is considered to be the finest of Mexico's pottery traditions, which is still made with the same techniques as in the colonial period.<ref name="artesaniasgob">{{cite web  |url= http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=35&Itemid=59  |title= Artesanias  |author= Luis Alberto Martínez Álvarez  |publisher= Government of Puebla  |location= Puebla, Mexico  |date= May 28, 2010  |language= es  |trans-title= Handcrafts  |access-date= October 10, 2010  |archive-date= November 27, 2010  |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101127143906/http://puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=35&Itemid=59  |url-status= dead  }}</ref> Talavera pottery began in the city of Puebla when the Spaniards brought over from Europe the techniques of making maiolica pottery, itself brought from China via the Arabs. The techniques and designs were based on the pottery made in [[Talavera la Real|Talavera, Spain]]. The high-quality clay and the formation of [[guild]]s to ensure quality soon made pottery made in Puebla a near-luxury item. The craft waned after [[Mexican War of Independence|Independence]], but made a comeback in the latter 20th century. Today certified Talavera pottery in made only in a handful of workshops in the capital and other nearby communities. To be certified as genuine the same methods as used in the 16th century must be applied. True Talavera pottery is expensive and considered to be collectors’ items.<ref name="rincones44">Gonzalez, p. 44</ref>

Other types of pottery in the state exist. One is the black clay figures made in [[Acatlán de Osorio, Puebla|Acatlán de Osorio]]. Most of these figures are animals and are almost always painted with white designs. Black clay is also used to make cups, plates and other utilitarian items in other communities. Another important clay craft are the [[Tree of Life (craft)|Trees of Life]], mostly made in the community of [[Izúcar de Matamoros]] and Acatlán de Osorio. Traditionally, these are sculptures depicting [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] in the [[Garden of Eden]], but the craft has evolved to include other themes as well.<ref name="rincones45">Gonzalez, p. 45</ref>

The making of textiles and embroidery dates back to pre-Hispanic times. Traditional clothing such as [[rebozo]]s, [[sarape]]s, shirts and pants are still made in various parts of the state and reflect the different indigenous communities which are found here. [[Hueyapan (municipality)|Hueyapan]] is one of the better known artisanal textile producers, with clothing items and others richly and colorfully embroidered. Both the thread used to weave the cloth and embroider it are [[dyeing|dyed]] with [[natural dye]]s such as those obtained from the [[cochineal]] insect. Another area known for its textiles is [[Zacapoaxtla (municipality)|Zacapoaxtla]] in the north of the state.<ref name="rincones46">Gonzalez, p. 46</ref>

The town of [[Amozoc (municipality)|Amozoc]] is known for its silverwork. This tradition began when a number of metalworkers of various types settled here after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]] in the 16th century. These smiths made a variety of objects from the everyday such as knives, swords, stirrups and more, eventually branching into finer metals such as silver and gold, mother-of-pearl, ivory and more. However, it is silver smithing which has best survived to the present day.<ref name="artesaniasgob"/>

There are two widely practice paper crafts in Puebla. The making of bark paper or [[amatl|amate]] was known in pre-Hispanic times when such was reserved for special ceremonies and the recording of important information. It had an almost magical quality to it and was used for spells, clothing of idols and other ceremonial purposes. Today, the paper is still made as an art form and often painted with elaborate designs.<ref name="rincones48">Gonzalez, p. 48</ref> In Puebla, the paper is still made by hand and often it is hand-painted with pre-Hispanic designs.<ref name="artesaniasgob"/> One area noted for this craft is [[San Salvador Huixcolotla (municipality)|San Salvador Huixcolotla]].<ref name="rincones48"/> Another is [[Pahuatlán (municipality)|San Pablito Pahuatlán]] in the Sierra Norte.<ref name="artesaniasgob"/> One notable amate paper artist is [[curandero]] Alfonso García Téllez, who narrates stories and ceremonies in his works.<ref name="artesaniasgob"/> Another paper craft is [[papel picado]], or "chopped paper." This craft began with the introduction of [[crepe paper]] from Asia. This paper is elaborately cut to form figures and scenes which are then hung for decorative purposes for holidays such as [[Day of the Dead]]. This most traditional of these are laborious cut by hand, but most are done today by machine. Those native to Puebla feature a large figure with a detailed background and are considered to be part of the state's cultural heritage (Patrimonio Cultural del Estado de Puebla).<ref name="rincones48"/>

A relatively recent craft is the making of blown glass Christmas ornaments in [[Chignahuapan (municipality)|Chignahuapan]]. This municipality has about 200 workshops which employ about 1,500 workers, which makes the spherical ornaments individually and many are shipped internationally to the United States and Latin America. This craft is still growing and represents one of the more stable small scale manufacturing endeavors in Puebla.<ref name="rincones47">Gonzalez, p. 47</ref>

For many rural communities, the making of handcrafted furniture, both fine and rustic, is an important economic activity. One such community is [[Chalchicomula de Sesma (municipality)|Ciudad Serdán]], which makes wooden utensils, decorative figures and banister work in addition to furniture. It has a strong reputation along with Chignahuapan. Areas outside of Ciudad Serdán are known for specializing in reproductions of [[Louis XV style|Louis XV]] and [[Louis XVI style|Louis XVI]] furniture. The community of [[Trinidad Alonso Báez]] is known as the only place in Latin American where pianos are made purely by hand. They are also known for the repairing of musical instrument with many of the state's antique church organs fixed by craftsmen from here.<ref name="rincones47"/>

Onyx is a plentiful stone in the state and it is worked into figures and other items in various parts of the state. The most important deposit of the stone is in [[Tecali de Herrera (municipality)|Tecali]] and many workshops fill the streets of this town. Most of the pieces made are decorative in nature but small utilitarian items such as plates and ashtrays are also made.<ref name="rincones48"/>

Amozoc has been known for silver smithing since colonial times, when European techniques were brought over by the Spanish. As back then, they still make items such as jewelry, silverware, and items for church rituals. These smiths’ work is considered to be quality, with the finest pieces encrusted with precious and semi-precious gems, gold, and ivory.<ref name="rincones4849">Gonzalez, pp. 48–49</ref>

The first glass workshop in [[New Spain]] was established in Puebla by Spaniard Rodrigo Espinoza in 1542. It remained the only one in Spain's colonies for decades, exporting glass items to places such as [[Peru]] and [[Guatemala]]. In the 18th century, Pedro Antonio revitalized the craft with a new factory. This factory was the main producer until the establishment of the Compañia Empresarial para la Fabricacion del Vidrio Plano y Cristal in 1838. This company introduced French designs and techniques to Mexico. The next major glassmaker was Victor Martinez Filoteo, who established the Fabrica La Luz in 1935. This company is still the major producer of glass items in the state. Small workshops are prevalent in [[Huaquechula (municipality)|Huaquechula]], where they specialize items made with black and smoke-colored glass.<ref name="rincones49">Gonzalez, p. 49</ref>

Puebla is working with neighboring Veracruz to promote the area's tourist attractions and develop them in an ecologically sustainable way. Both state governments are working with organizations of tour operators, hotels and restaurants to pool a fund for activities such as advertising campaigns, especially to Mexico City and the [[State of Mexico]], which account for 80% of all the state's visitors. Another is the reimbursement of tolls for those who travel to certain attractions such as the Africam Safari park and two-for-one specials. Efforts have succeeded in raising hotel occupancy rates from 40% to 56% in a number of areas.<ref name="reactivar">{{cite news |title= Estados de Puebla y Veracruz inician campanas para reactivar turismo |author= Humberto Nino de Haro|newspaper=Noticias Financieras |location=Miami |date=June 8, 2009  |language=es |trans-title=States of Puebla and Veracruz begin campaigns to reactivate tourism}}</ref>

==Archeological sites==
[[File:Mexico.Pue.Cholula.Pyramid.01.jpg|thumb|[[Great Pyramid of Cholula]]]]
[[File:Cantona12.jpg|thumb|Cantona]]
[[Cantona (Mesoamerican site)|Cantona]] is a {{convert|12|km2|0|abbr=out}} archeological site, located in the north of the state between the municipalities of [[Tepehualco]] and [[Coyoaco]]. It is divided into three units, with work only done on the south unit, which is the best preserved. Here is found the "Acropolis," an area with temples, palaces and other seats of authority. The site was occupied between the 7th and 11th centuries CE and reached its height at the time many other Classic era urban centers were falling. It is thought that this city interrupted the flow of goods from the coast of Veracruz to [[Teotihuacan]], one of the many causes of that city's downfall. The site is filled with a large number of patios which measure 50 x 40 meters or larger. Total number of patios found is 620, and 997 mounds have been found as well. In some areas, remains of obsidian and sandstone workshops have been found.<ref name="cantonagob">{{cite web |url=http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=152:zonas-arqueologicas-cantona&catid=31:arqueologia&Itemid=55 |title=Cantona |author=Luis Alberto Martínez Álvarez |publisher=Government of Puebla |location=Puebla, Mexico |date=January 8, 2007 |language=es |trans-title=Cantona |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-date=December 19, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219185912/http://puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=152:zonas-arqueologicas-cantona&catid=31:arqueologia&Itemid=55 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Cholula was once a major Mesoamerican city with a multicultural population that was bound by a common religion based on the worship of [[Quetzalcoatl]]. The city was a pilgrimage site for the worship of this deity. Its architecture was complex and shows various foreign influences. Its height was reached during the Classic period between 100 and 900 CE along with [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]] and Teotihuacan. It was regionally influential for much of the Mesoamerican period, and its polychromic pottery has been found in a large number of sites, indicating trade. By the time the Spanish arrived, it was still a very large city, second only to Tenochtitlan, to which it was subject. Today, the site is known for its Great Pyramid.<ref name="cholulagob">{{cite web |url=http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=151:zona-arquelogica-cholula&catid=31:arqueologia&Itemid=55 |title=Cholula |author=Luis Alberto Martínez Álvarez |publisher=Government of Puebla |location=Puebla, Mexico |date=May 28, 2010 |language=es |trans-title=Cholula |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-date=December 19, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219185700/http://puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=151:zona-arquelogica-cholula&catid=31:arqueologia&Itemid=55 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
[[File:TepejiViejo.jpg|thumb|Tepexi el Viejo]]
[[Tepexi el Viejo]] is located southeast of the city of Puebla. It was founded as the seat of one of the most important [[Popoloca]] dominions and control much of what is now the south of the state from 1200 to 1500 CE. This area's light orange colored pottery has been found as far away as Teotihuacan. The site is naturally protected by mountains and canyons and is divided into five areas. Each has platforms, pyramidal mounds, residential areas and tombs. The most important pyramidal mound is located in the center of the site and other, smaller one is located to the extreme west. Residences are located in the northwest, many of which are L-shaped. There is only one natural opening to the area, which is in the south about {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} outside the city's walls.<ref name="tepexigob">{{cite web |url=http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=149:tepexi&catid=31:arqueologia&Itemid=55 |title=Tepexi el Viejo |author=Luis Alberto Martínez Álvarez |publisher=Government of Puebla |location=Puebla, Mexico |date=May 28, 2010 |language=es |trans-title=Tepexi el Viejo |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-date=December 19, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219185938/http://puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=149:tepexi&catid=31:arqueologia&Itemid=55 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Unlike other sites in the state, [[Yohualichan]] was dominated by coastal groups, which eventually abandoned it in the face of incursions from peoples from the central highlands. The site was a ceremonial center which was probably dominant over other similar sites. Containing niched pyramids as well, it is related to the [[El Tajín]] site in Veracruz. There is also a residential area, but it has not been studied.<ref name="yohualichangob">{{cite web |url= http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=150:yohualichan&catid=31:arqueologia&Itemid=55 |title= Yohualichan |author= Luis Alberto Martínez Álvarez |publisher= Government of Puebla |location= Puebla, Mexico |date= May 28, 2010 |language= es |trans-title= Yohualichan |access-date= October 10, 2010 |archive-date= December 19, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101219190359/http://puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=150:yohualichan&catid=31:arqueologia&Itemid=55 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

[[Tepatlaxco (Mesoamerican site)|Tepatlaxco]] is located on the south side of the Totlqueme mountain. It is centered on a ceremonial center which has more than eight structures, surrounded by numerous smaller mounds. Much of the site was constructed into the mountain itself, causing it to blend in. In addition to the mountain, there are two large ravines to give the site added protection. The most important structure is named Mound A, which also shows the longest occupation. It measures nine meters high and 36 meters at its base.<ref name="tepatlaxcogob">{{cite web |url= http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=148:tepatlaxco&catid=31:arqueologia&Itemid=55 |title= Tepatlaxco |author= Luis Alberto Martínez Álvarez |publisher= Government of Puebla |location= Puebla, Mexico |date= May 28, 2010 |language= es |trans-title= Tepatlaxco |access-date= October 10, 2010 |archive-date= December 19, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101219190330/http://puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=148:tepatlaxco&catid=31:arqueologia&Itemid=55 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

==Food==
[[File:CemitaSandwich2.JPG|thumb|Cemita sandwich]]
Other foods common to the state include [[atole]] with [[chili pepper]] ([[chileatole]]), spicy [[mole (sauce)|mole verde]], [[barbacoa]], chilate with chopped onion, cemitas, [[cecina (meat)|cecina]], guacamole with lime, and mole de caderas or mole espinazo. Many of these are found in the Sierra Mixteca region.<ref name="smixteca"/> However, the state is best known for [[cemita]]s, [[mole poblano]], [[chiles en nogada]] and [[chalupa]]s.

The cemita is a kind of sandwich on a roll, related to the [[torta]], particularly popular in Mexico City and the [[pambazo]], which is of French origin and popular in several areas in central Mexico. The sandwich has its origin with two kinds of bread which were brought over from Spain during the colonial period: one called "bizcocho de sal", which was long and hard and a kind of hollow cracker. Both breads were developed for long storage and eventually were made in Puebla with grain from the Atlixco area. These two breads eventually fused into a unique type that became softer by the mid 19th century.<ref name="cemitasgob">{{cite web |url= http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=173:cemitas-poblanas&catid=38:Gastronom%C3%ADa&Itemid=62 |title= Cemitas Poblanas |author= Luis Alberto Martínez Álvarez |publisher= Government of Puebla |location= Puebla, Mexico |date= May 28, 2010 |language= es |trans-title= Cemitas of Puebla |access-date= October 10, 2010 |archive-date= September 27, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110927160734/http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=173:cemitas-poblanas&catid=38:Gastronom%C3%ADa&Itemid=62 |url-status= dead }}</ref> The name is derived from a Jewish unleavened bread called "semita", which was brought over by [[Sephardi Jews]] to [[New Spain]]. These were also produced in Puebla state. The cemitas were prepared at home and filled with potatoes, beans and nopal cactus and eaten by the lower classes. Later, an establishment in the Mercado Victoria market began to sell them to the public filled with meat from bull's feet with a [[vinaigrette]], herbs, onions and chili peppers. This new filling was a hit and eventually this and other variations became a staple in many markets and popular eateries. Today, a large number varieties exist but all are prepared using the same type of bread.<ref name="cemitasgob"/>

[[File:Mole Poblano.jpg|thumb|Mole poblano]]
The best-known mole is named after the city of Puebla, [[mole poblano]]. The origin of this sauce is disputed and there are two versions of the legend that are most often cited. The first states that 16th century nuns from the Convent of Santa Rosa were worried because they had just found out that the archbishop was going to visit them and they had nothing to prepare for him except for an old turkey in the yard. Supposedly due to divine inspiration, they began to mix together many of the spices and flavorings they had on hand in the kitchen, including different types of chili peppers, other spices, day-old bread, chocolate and approximately twenty other ingredients. They let the sauce simmer for hours and poured it over the turkey meat. Fortunately, the archbishop was very pleased with the meal and the nuns were able to save face.<ref name="national">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mexonline.com/molepoblano.htm |title= Mole Poblano: Mexico's National Food Dish  |publisher=Mexonline |access-date=2009-10-21}}</ref>

The other story states that the sauce is of pre-Hispanic times and this was served to [[Hernán Cortés]] and the other conquistadors by [[Moctezuma II]].<ref name="national"/> The Aztecs did have a preparation called "chilmulli", which in [[Nahuatl]] means "chili pepper sauce".<ref name="92percent">{{cite news |first=Josefina |last=Quintero M. |title=92% de la población se dedica a la preparación y venta del mole |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2007/09/23/index.php?section=capital&article=035n1cap |publisher=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=2007-09-23 |access-date=May 30, 2009 |language=es}}</ref> However, there is no evidence that chocolate was ever used to flavor prepared foods or used in chilmulli.<ref name="national"/> What has happened is that the sauce gained ingredients as it was reinterpreted over the colonial period.<ref name="92percent"/>

[[File:Chile en nogada.jpg|thumb|Chile en nogada]]
According to the legend of chiles en nogada, there were three sisters from the city of Puebla who were in Mexico City. When the [[Army of the Three Guarantees]] entered the capital at the end of the [[Mexican War of Independence]], they were feted by many. At one of these parties, the three sisters fell in love with three of the army's officers. Soon after, [[Agustín de Iturbide]] himself was set to visit the city of Puebla. Remembering the sisters, the soon-to-be emperor wanted to visit them. Wanting to impress Iturbide but not knowing how to cook, the sisters turned to the nuns of the Santa Monica convent who were famous for their food. The nuns decided to invent a dish for the sisters, which would represent the three colors of the [[Flag of Mexico|new Mexican flag]]. On the appointed day, the banquet was prepared with the dish now called chiles en nogada, which pleased Iturbide.<ref name="chilesnogada">{{cite web |url= http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=171:chiles-en-nogada&catid=37:Leyendas&Itemid=61 |title= Chiles en Nogada |author= Luis Alberto Martínez Álvarez |publisher= Government of Puebla |location= Puebla, Mexico |date= May 28, 2010 |language= es |trans-title= Chiles en Nogada |access-date= October 10, 2010 |archive-date= September 27, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110927155705/http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=171:chiles-en-nogada&catid=37:Leyendas&Itemid=61 |url-status= dead }}</ref> The dish contains poblano chile, walnuts, cream and pomegranate seeds, and offered seasonally (August–September) in local restaurants.

Chalupas are thick corn tortillas fried in lard then covered in red or green chili pepper sauce and topped with shredded meat and other things. According to legend, they were named after the barges that the [[Aztec]]s used to travel in areas such as [[Tenochtitlan]] (today Mexico City). Chalupas are popular in other areas of central Mexico but are considered a specialty of Puebla, where they are served from humble street carts to upscale restaurants.<ref name="chalupasgob">{{cite web  |url= http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=174:chalupas&catid=38:Gastronom%C3%ADa&Itemid=62  |title= Chalupas  |author= Luis Alberto Martínez Álvarez  |publisher= Government of Puebla  |location= Puebla, Mexico  |date= May 28, 2010  |language= es  |trans-title= Chalupas  |access-date= October 10, 2010  |archive-date= September 27, 2011  |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110927160755/http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=174:chalupas&catid=38:Gastronom%C3%ADa&Itemid=62  |url-status= dead  }}</ref>

==Myths and legends==
[[File:Fundacion Puebla.jpg|thumb|upright|Mural of the founding of Puebla by Roberto Cueva Del Río]]
The legend of the founding of the city of Puebla attributes to the act of the vision of a friar [[Julián Garcés]], who became the first bishop of Puebla. The legend states that while praying, the friar fell asleep, when he dreamed of a festival in honor the [[Archangel Michael]] happening in a place with leafy trees and a crystal clear river, flowing from springs. As they contemplated the scenery, angels descended from heaven and traced the outlines of the city to be built. When he awoke, he drew what he had seen, deciding he had had a divine vision. He communicated the dream to other [[Franciscans]] and found the place he saw five days later.<ref name="fundacion">{{cite web |url= http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=37&Itemid=61 |title= Leyendas |author= Luis Alberto Martínez Álvarez |publisher= Government of Puebla |location= Puebla, Mexico |date= May 28, 2010 |language= es |trans-title= Legends |access-date= October 10, 2010 |archive-date= November 27, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101127143950/http://puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=37&Itemid=61 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

The story of the [[Catarina de San Juan|China Poblana]] is one of the most popular in the state. The girl was taken on the [[Manila Galleon]], but she was sold to Puebla resident Miguel de Sosa for a price ten times what the [[viceroy]] offered. She was taken to the city and baptized with the name of Catarina de San Juan in 1620. She maintained her oriental dress which made her conspicuous and it became a fad to imitate some aspects of this dress.<ref name="rincones37">Gonzalez, p. 37</ref>

When de Sosa and his wife died, Catherine entered a convent and began to see visions of the Virgin Mary and the [[Child Jesus]]. Some say that a number of miracles occurred while Catherine lived at the convent and this provoked a kind of veneration of her. When the China Poblana died in 1882, veneration of her as a saint began in earnest, but the practice was put to an end by the [[Mexican Inquisition]]. Today her remains are in a crypt in the Temple de La Compañia in the city of Puebla.<ref name="rincones38">Gonzalez, p. 38</ref>

The Aztec myth of [[Popocatépetl]] and [[Iztaccíhuatl]], a [[Romeo and Juliet]] type story, has equal significance in this state as it does in the [[Valley of Mexico]] as the two are equally visible from the city of Puebla, but only in reverse (with Popocatépetl on the left).<ref name="rincones39">Gonzalez, p. 39</ref>

There is a popular saying "todo terminó como el Rosario de Amozoc, a golpes y farolazos" (it all ended like the Amozoc Rosary, with blows and drinks). The saying is derived from a legend from the community of [[Amozoc (municipality)|Amozoc de Mota]] in the state. A silversmith apprentice by the name of Alberto was in love with a beautiful girl named Catalina, nicknamed La Culata. However, another apprentice from another shop named Enrique, was also in love with her. Alberto was accepted by la Culata and this made Enrique jealous. Festivities for the beginning of the year were supposed to be organized by the different silver workshops together but the rivalry caused a split in which ecclesiastical authorities needed to intervene. On the first day of the event, at Mass, Enrique saw Alberto and Catherine kiss briefly, which enraged him. During the rosary, while the choir sang "Mater Inmaculata," Enrique heard "mata a la Culata" (kill La Culata), took a knife from his clothing and attacked the couple, killing Catarina. Alberto took a machete from his belt and killed Enrique. A fight ensued which left many dead and wounded. It is said that one can still hear the cries of Catalina as she died.<ref name="rincones3940">Gonzalez, pp. 39–40</ref>

The house at Avenida 3 Ote 201 in the city of Puebla belonged to Pedro de Carvajal, who was a wealthy and respected man. However, he lost his young wife as she gave birth to their second child, a boy. When his daughter turned 15, there were many interested suitors but she was not interested in them. One day a monster appeared at a party in the city provoking terror. The monster went to the Carvajal house and ate the younger son, who was playing out front of the house. Pedro offered a large reward for the capture of the beast. One young man, who wanted the hand of Pedro's daughter, appeared at another festival, bearing the head of the beast. It is said that this young man gained noble title and the hand of the daughter as a reward.<ref name="matoanimal">{{cite web |url= http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=170:casa-del-que-mato-al-animal&catid=37:Leyendas&Itemid=61 |title= Casa del que mato al Animal |author= Luis Alberto Martínez Álvarez |publisher= Government of Puebla |location= Puebla, Mexico |date= May 28, 2010 |language= es |trans-title= House of He who killed the animal |access-date= October 10, 2010 |archive-date= September 27, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110927160945/http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=170:casa-del-que-mato-al-animal&catid=37:Leyendas&Itemid=61 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

===The two volcanos===
The state of Puebla is located on the east side of the volcanoes of Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl, opposite of the Valley of Mexico and Mexico City. The two volcanoes have as much significance here as they do on the west side, with many communities nearby maintaining ritual specific to honoring the two. These arose as fertility rituals but today are called "birthdays" with 12 March reserved for Popocatepetl and 30 August for Iztaccíhuatl. On these events, special foods and gifts are prepared as offerings and left in certain places. These traditions have survived despite the evangelization efforts of the colonial period.<ref name="rincones24">Gonzalez, p. 24</ref>

===Festivals and holiday===
The state is home to a number of festivals and traditions, from those with a purely pre-Hispanic background, to the far more numerous saints’ days to modern fairs located to regional economies.<ref name="fiestastrad">{{cite web |url=http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=13&Itemid=20 |title=Fiestas y tradiciones Álvarez |publisher=Government of Puebla |location=Puebla, Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Festivals and traditions |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-date=November 27, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127081803/http://puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=13&Itemid=20 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="rincones2529">Gonzalez, pp. 25–29</ref> The largest important events include the [[Day of the Dead]] in Huaquechula, the Carnival of Huijotzingo, [[spring equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|Spring Equinox]] in Cantona, Fiesta de Santo Entierro y Feria de las Flores, the Fería del Café y el Huipil, the Huey Atlixcáyotl Festival, the Quetzalcoatl Ritual and [[Cinco de Mayo]], celebrated in the entire state.<ref name="fiestastrad"/><ref name="cincoschmal">{{cite web |url= http://www.houstonculture.org/mexico/cincodemayoesp.html |title= El cinco de mayo: una lucha por la libertad. |author= John P.

Cinco de Mayo—or the fifth of May—is a holiday that celebrates the date of the Mexican army's 1862 victory over France at the Battle of Puebla during the Franco-Mexican War (1861-1867). A relatively minor holiday in Mexico, in the United States Cinco de Mayo has evolved into a commemoration of Mexican culture and heritage, particularly in areas with large Mexican-American populations.<ref name="auto1">Steph2017</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/holidays/cinco-de-mayo|title=Cinco de Mayo: History, Facts & Meaning - HISTORY|website=HISTORY.com|date=3 May 2024 }}</ref>
Many Americans mistakenly believe that Cinco de Mayo ("May 5th") is the Mexican equivalent of the United States’ Fourth of July holiday — a date marking the official casting off of colonial rule via the announcement of a new independent country. However, the Mexican version of Independence Day is celebrated on September 16, for it was on that date in 1810 that the commencement of the war for Mexican independence from Spanish rule was pronounced in the small town of Dolores by Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla (an event now referred to as the "Grito de Dolores" — "Cry of Dolores" — or "El Grito de la Independencia").<ref name="auto1"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cinco-de-mayo/|title=What Is Cinco de Mayo?|website=Snopes.com|date=5 May 2015 }}</ref>

Cinco de Mayo is an important celebration in a number of places the United States, but it is a minor holiday or even unknown in much of Mexico proper. The only place where the holiday, which commemorates the [[Battle of Puebla]] during the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French Intervention in Mexico]], is important is in the state of Puebla. The French army invaded the country in 1862 and marched from Veracruz towards the city of Puebla. Just outside the city, inexperienced Mexican troops attacked the French who were camped. This resulted in victory, but the French were ultimately able to move on and take Mexico City, dominating the country until 1867. The annual celebration of the battle began in the state in areas of the country not occupied by the French as a symbol of Mexican pride.<ref name="cincoschmal"/> Today it is the most important state political commemoration. The most important observances take place at the Loreto and Guadalupe forts in the city of Puebla, where the battle occurred in 1862. The highlight is a reenactment of the event at the site.<ref name="rincones2529"/>

Like the rest of Mexico, Day of the Dead is celebrated in the state. Two aspects which feature prominently on altars in this state are [[mole (sauce)|mole]] with turkey and large wax candles. Other items can include black [[candelabra]]s, incense burners, candy skulls, decorative paper cutouts, oranges and other fruits in season. Leading to these altars often are a line of small candles to guide the returning spirits. One municipality which is particularly known for its events is [[Huaquechula (municipality)|Huaquechula]]. Here, altars constructed in homes can be of multiple levels and are usually covered in white paper. On the first level, food and drink are usually placed, with religious objects and objects related to the deceased on the second level.<ref name="huaquechula">{{cite web |url= http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=227:dia-de-muertos-y-altares-de-huaquechula&catid=43:principales-ferias-y-tradiciones&Itemid=67 |author= Luz Cortés Padilla |title= Día de muertos y altares de Huaquechula |publisher= Government of Puebla |location= Puebla, Mexico |date= July 27, 2009 |language= es |trans-title= Day of the Dead and altars of Huaquechula |access-date= October 10, 2010 |archive-date= November 27, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101127212233/http://puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=227:dia-de-muertos-y-altares-de-huaquechula&catid=43:principales-ferias-y-tradiciones&Itemid=67 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

In a number of communities in the state, Carnival is celebrated. The best known of these carnivals takes place in [[Huejotzingo (municipality)|Huejotzingo]], as it began as a synthesis of a celebration honoring [[Tlaloc]] and the Catholic tradition related to the days before [[Ash Wednesday]]. Today, this carnival includes many traditional activities such as music, masks and parades, but this one also includes a reenactment of the Battle of Puebla and local legends such as the kidnapping of a governor's daughter and<ref name="rincones2529"/> the legend of Agustìn Lorenzo (called the Robin Hood of the 18th century).<ref name="huejotzingocarn">{{cite web |url=http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=228:carnaval-de-huejotzingo&catid=43:principales-ferias-y-tradiciones&Itemid=67 |author=Luz Cortés Padilla |title=Carnaval de Huejotzingo |publisher=Government of Puebla |location=Puebla, Mexico |date=May 22, 2009 |language=es |trans-title=Carnival of Huejotzingo |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-date=November 27, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127212046/http://puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=228:carnaval-de-huejotzingo&catid=43:principales-ferias-y-tradiciones&Itemid=67 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Locals attend in colorful costumes and masks representing the [[Conquistador]]s, demons or animals, adorned with palm fronds or feathers.<ref name="huejotzingocarn"/> The capital of Puebla also celebrates Carnival with its signature tradition of the Las Marias, where men disguise themselves as women and mischievous devils.<ref name="rincones2529"/>

Another major time for religious observance is [[Holy Week]] or Semana Santa. In Puebla, there is the Procession del Silencio or Procession of Silence which occurs on [[Maundy Thursday]], when the city observes a period of silence to mark the death of Jesus.<ref name="rincones2529"/>

The spring equinox is the setting for rituals at some of Puebla's archeological sites such as Cantona and Cholula. Cantona is an archeological site located near the city of Puebla and was one of the largest cities in early Mesoamerica. Today, the site is popular gathering place on the spring equinox ([[Spring equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|much like Teotihuacan]]), where people sing, dance and greet the sunrise on this date.<ref name="equinoxcan">{{cite web |url=http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=230:equinoccio-en-cantona&catid=43:principales-ferias-y-tradiciones&Itemid=67 |author=Luz Cortés Padilla |title=Equinoccio en Cantona |publisher=Government of Puebla |location=Puebla, Mexico |date=July 22, 2009 |language=es |trans-title=Equinox in Cantona |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-date=November 27, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127211658/http://puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=230:equinoccio-en-cantona&catid=43:principales-ferias-y-tradiciones&Itemid=67 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Another site where similar observances are held is the Great Pyramid of Cholula.

In July, the [[Pueblo Mágico]] of [[Cuetzalan]] has the cultural festival of Festival Tradicional, which features traditional dancers who come from various parts of the state. [[Tetela de Ocampo]] celebrates its Peach Festival in August. On the last day of August, the Procession de los Faroles (Procession of the Lanterns) takes place in [[Cholula, Puebla|Cholula]].<ref name="rincones2529"/>

Puebla has a number of annual fairs meant to highlights the various regions’ products.

===China Poblana===
[[File:China poblana.jpg|thumb|upright|Woman in ''china poblana'' dress]]
The China Poblana was a real person who lived during the colonial period. Her real name was Mirra. She was an [[Indians in the Philippines|Indian]] who was brought over from [[Manila]] in the 1620s on the [[Manila Galleon]] as a child to work as a slave for the [[viceroy]] Marques de Gélves. She was soon sold to ship captain Miguel de Sosa who lived in Puebla. According to legend, Mirra was originally a princess in her home country but her family was displaced by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and she was kidnapped by pirates who sold her. Mirra was considered to be beautiful and exotic. She had been converted to the Catholic faith. Later in her life, she began to have visions of the child Jesus and angels. Her fame grew and she was eventually considered to be something of a prophet. When she died in 1688, people began to venerate her as a saint and many women copied her Asian/Mexican inspired dress.<ref name="chinpob">{{cite web |url=http://redescolar.ilce.edu.mx/redescolar/act_permanentes/historia/histdeltiempo/mexicana/colonia/c_chinap.htm |title=Historia y leyenda de la china poblana De la Colonia |work=Red Escolar |publisher=Instituto Latinoamericano de la Comunicacion Educativa |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=History and legend of the "China Poblana" of the colonial period |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-date=August 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809084701/http://redescolar.ilce.edu.mx/redescolar/act_permanentes/historia/histdeltiempo/mexicana/colonia/c_chinap.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

This fashion led to the now-traditional ''china poblana'' dress. It consists of a red skirt heavily decorated with colored sequins that in one part form the image of the eagle found on the Mexican flag and a blouse embroidered with colored thread and beads around the bust area. It is often worn with a [[charro]]-type hat. The outfit is the amalgam of several cultures such as Spanish, especially in the skirt; Chinese, with its use of sequins and beads; and indigenous, with colorful embroidery.<ref name="rincones23"/>

===Dance===
Folk dance of both indigenous and mixed European and indigenous origin are most often seen at religious and cultural events in many parts of the state. Some of the most popular dances include "Moors and Christians," Dance of the Santiagos" and "Danza de los Arcos." The last is usually performed only by men who dress in white and with a scarf-like garment across the chest, dance in pairs which carry large arch portals covered in flowers and paper decorations. The dance has a number of variations which can include leaps into the air and complicated twirls.<ref name="rincones23"/>

The Dances of the Quetzales is most popular in the Sierra Norte, especially in Cuetzalan. It is a highly symbolic dance and usually performed in conjunction with rituals that relate to good harvests. The dancers form crosses, which signify the four cardinal directions and move in circles, which symbolize the rotation of time. The dancers wear large circular headdresses of quetzal feathers, which give the dance its name, and red suits. The [[Danza de los Voladores de Papantla|Dance of the Voladores]], which more common in [[Papantla, Veracruz]], is also performed in a number of communities in the north of Puebla. This consists of five men who climb a tall pole and then four fall and spin from the pole while attached by ropes. The fifth dancer stays on top and plays music and dances as the other men fall. Another important dance in Puebla is the Doce pares de Francia, which recalls the events of the Battle of Puebla.<ref name="rincones24"/>

The colonial architecture of the state is defined by its heavy use of ornamental tiles called [[Talavera (pottery)|Talavera]]. This is particularly true in the capital. This makes these buildings more colorful than most of their contemporaries in other parts of Mexico and was one of the reasons that the historic center of the capital was selected as a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name="rincones13">Gonzalez, p. 13</ref>

A number of churches and other buildings in rural parts of the state are noted for their "folk baroque" architecture and decoration, especially in Atlixco and the southwest. Folk baroque consists of the use of tile and painted raised stucco based on more traditional [[Baroque architecture|Baroque designs]], which was most popular in the 18th century. One well known church of this type is the church of [[Jolapan]], which is modeled after the [[Tepalcingo]] Sanctuary in neighboring [[Morelos]]. The church of Jolalpan contains richly decorated [[pilaster]]s, [[Solomonic column]]s and other elements in a design very similar to that of Tepalcingo. Between these there are a number of small churches which also show folk baroque influence such as those in [[Tlancualpican]] and [[Tzicatlán]]. The church in Tlancualpican is painted in bright blues, greens and red, with an ornate [[façade]] with sculpted leaves, tendrils and niches divided by spiral half-columns all done in stucco. Even more ornate is the church in Tzicatlán, which is a small rural farming village, with the entire surface of the main façade decorated with brightly colored images and sculptures.<ref name="folkbaroque">{{cite web |url= http://www.colonial-mexico.com/Central%20Mexico/tepalcingo.html |title= The Folk Baroque churches of southern Morelos and Puebla |work= Exploring Colonial Mexico |publisher= Espadaña Press |access-date= October 10, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100930182719/http://www.colonial-mexico.com/Central%20Mexico/tepalcingo.html |archive-date= September 30, 2010 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

In the modern era, architectural styles have evolved into new and sometimes eclectic forms. Skyscrapers, almost all of which are in the city of Puebla, include Edificio Vacas at 42 meters high, Torre Géminis at 50 meters high, Torre Nora at 69 meters high to the tallest, Torre Ejecutiva JVI and Torre Ejecutiva JVI at 100 meters high each. These last two have a triangular shape and are covered in blue tinged glass.<ref name="rincones13"/>

===Literature===
Literature is one of the better-developed arts in the state and includes works such as novels, essays, poetry and theatrical plays. One prominent name from the colonial period is that of José Mariano Beristáin de Souza who was a priest and writers in the 18th century. He is also known for amassing a large library of writings in Spanish over twenty years of his life, which resulted in the Biblioteca Hispanoamericana Septentrional.<ref name="rincones13"/> However, literature would not be a major cultural force in the state until the 20th century. One early prominent writer was poet [[Gregorio de Gante]]. In his early career, he was a professor but after the [[Mexican Revolution]] broke out the joined revolutionary forces under Antonio Medina. After the war, he began his career as a poet, eventually writing regularly for a newspaper called "El Nacional" and become one of Mexico's most popular writers by the 1930s.<ref name="rincones14">Gonzalez, p. 14</ref>

Much of the historical painting in the state is found in its colonial churches and reflect the artistic styles of the 16 to 19th centuries. These consist of murals, portraits and biblical scenes done on canvas, wood and other mediums. José Joaquín Magón was born in Puebla in the 18th century is known for his portrait paintings but his other works have mostly religious and mythological themes.

Much of Puebla's art scene had disappeared before the 20th century but in the 1920s, a group of young artists from the Escuela de Bellas Artes de Puebla (School of Fine Arts of Puebla) began to band together for mutual support. These artists eventually caught the attention and patronage of artists such as [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Dr. Atl]] and received visitors such as [[David Alfaro Siquieros]], [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Francisco Cornejo]] and [[Alfredo Guati Rojo]]. This effort would become the Barrio del Artista.<ref name="artefluye">{{cite news |title= Encuentros con Mexico / El arte fluye en las calles; [1] |author= Ricardo Diazmunoz |author2=Maryell Ortiz de Zarate |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=April 24, 2005  |language=es |trans-title=Encounters with Mexico/Art flows in the streets}}</ref>
