'''KwaZulu-Natal''' ({{IPAc-en|k|w|ɑː|ˌ|z|uː|l|uː|_|n|ə|ˈ|t|ɑː|l}}, also referred to as '''KZN'''; nicknamed "the garden province")<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.southafrica.info/about/geography/kwazulu-natal.htm |title=KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa |access-date=10 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724082744/http://www.southafrica.info/about/geography/kwazulu-natal.htm#.U0ZMuuaSz58 |archive-date=24 July 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> is a [[Provinces of South Africa|province of South Africa]] that was created in 1994 when the government merged the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] [[bantustan]] of [[KwaZulu]] ("Place of the Zulu" in [[Zulu language|Zulu]]) and [[Natal Province]].

It is located in the southeast of the country, with a long shoreline on the [[Indian Ocean]]. It shares borders with three other provinces and the countries of [[Mozambique]], [[Eswatini]] and [[Lesotho]]. Its capital is [[Pietermaritzburg]], and its largest city is [[Durban]], which is also the [[Port of Durban|largest port city]] in sub-saharan Africa. It is the second-most populous province in South Africa, after [[Gauteng]].

Two areas in KwaZulu-Natal have been declared [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s: the [[iSimangaliso Wetland Park]] and the [[uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park]]. These areas are extremely scenic as well as important to the surrounding ecosystems.

During the 1830s and early 1840s, the northern part of what is now KwaZulu-Natal was established as the [[Zulu Kingdom]]. The southern part was, briefly, the [[Boer]] [[Natalia Republic]] before the British took over control in 1843, renaming it as the [[Colony of Natal]] in 1843. The Zulu Kingdom remained independent until 1879.

KwaZulu-Natal is the birthplace of many notable figures in South Africa's history, such as [[Albert Luthuli]], the first non-white and the first person from outside Europe and the Americas to be awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] (1960); [[Pixley ka Isaka Seme]], the founder of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) and South Africa's first black lawyer; [[John Langalibalele Dube]], the ANC's founding president; [[Harry Gwala]], ANC member and anti-apartheid activist; [[Mac Maharaj]], Grammy award-winning group [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]], Grammy award-winning DJ [[Black Coffee (DJ)|Black Coffee]], ANC member, anti-apartheid activist and [[little Rivonia Trial|Little Rivonia Trial defendant]]; [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi]], the founder of the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]] (IFP); [[Anton Lembede]], the founding president of the [[ANC Youth League]]; [[Jacob Zuma]], the former [[President of South Africa]]; [[Bhambatha]], a 19th-century Zulu chief who became an [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|anti-apartheid]] icon; and [[Shaka Zulu]].

== Geography ==
[[File:Howick falls3.jpg|thumb|The [[Mngeni River]] valley near [[Howick Falls]]]]

At around {{cvt|92,100|km2}} in area, KwaZulu-Natal is roughly the size of Portugal. It has three different geographic areas and is the eastern most province in the country. The [[lowland]] region along the Indian Ocean coast is extremely narrow in the south, widening in the northern part of the province, while the central [[KwaZulu-Natal Midlands|Natal Midlands]] consists of an undulating hilly [[plateau]] rising toward the west. Two mountainous areas, the western [[Drakensberg|Drakensberg Mountains]] and northern [[Lebombo Mountains]] form, respectively, a solid [[basalt]] wall rising over {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} beside Lesotho border and low parallel ranges of ancient [[granite]] running southward from Eswatini. The area's largest river, the [[Tugela River|Tugela]], flows west to east across the center of the province.

The coastal regions typically have [[subtropical]] thickets and deeper ravines; steep slopes host some [[Knysna-Amatole montane forests|Afromontane Forest]]. The midlands have moist grasslands and isolated pockets of Afromontane Forest. The north has a primarily moist [[savanna]] habitat, whilst the Drakensberg region hosts mostly [[Alpine climate|alpine]] [[grassland]].

The province contains rich areas of biodiversity of a range of flora and fauna. The [[iSimangaliso Wetland Park]] and the [[uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park]] have been declared [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s. The iSimangaliso Wetland Park, along with uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park and Ndumo, are [[wetlands]] of international importance for [[bird migration|migratory]] species and are designated as [[Ramsar sites]]. South Africa signed the 1971 [[Ramsar Convention]] to try to conserve and protect important wetlands because of their importance to habitats and numerous species.

The former [[Eastern Cape]] [[enclave]] of the town of [[Umzimkulu]] and its hinterland have been incorporated into KwaZulu-Natal following the 12th amendment of the [[Constitution of South Africa]]. The amendment also made other changes to the southern border of the province.

The northwesterly line of equal latitude and longitude traverses the province from the coast at [[Hibberdene]] ({{coord|30|34|35|S|30|34|35|E}}) to northeast [[Lesotho]].

The province became the first to include a portion of road that is made of partial plastic, the equivalent of nearly 40,000 recycled milk cartons.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Plastic bottles repaving South Africa's roads|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/30/business/plastic-roads-in-south-africa-intl/index.html|last=Reynolds|first=Emma|website=CNN|date=30 October 2019|access-date=2020-05-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://averda.co.za/news/south-africas-first-plastic-based-road-has-been-built/&grqid=sgCQUjd6&s=1&hl=en-ZA|title=South Africas first plastic based road has been built|publisher=averda.co.za|date=2019-09-28|access-date=2020-05-20}}{{Dead link|date=May 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Climate===
[[File:Upland South Africa Savanna.jpg|thumb|Upland savannah near Pietermaritzburg|237x237px]]
[[File:Coastal mangrove forest near Durban's Umgeni River.jpg|alt=Mangrove forest at the Umgeni River estuary in Durban|thumb|236x236px|Mangrove forest at the Umgeni River estuary in Durban]]
KwaZulu-Natal has a varied yet verdant climate thanks to diverse, complex topography. Generally, the coast is [[subtropical]] with inland regions becoming progressively colder. [[Durban]] on the south coast has an annual rainfall of 1009&nbsp;mm, with daytime maxima peaking from January to March at {{convert|28|°C|°F|abbr=on}} with a minimum of {{convert|21|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, dropping to daytime highs from June to August of {{convert|23|°C|°F|abbr=on}} with a minimum of {{convert|11|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.

The temperature drops towards the hinterland, with [[Pietermaritzburg]] being similar in the summer, but much cooler in the winter. [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]] in the Tugela River Valley reaches {{convert|30|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in the summer but may drop below freezing point on winter evenings. The Drakensberg can experience heavy winter snow, with light snow occasionally experienced on the highest peaks in summer. The Zululand north coast has the warmest climate and highest humidity, supporting many [[sugar cane]] farms around Pongola.

===Borders===
KwaZulu-Natal borders the following areas of Mozambique, Eswatini and Lesotho:
*[[Maputo Province|Maputo Province, Mozambique]]        (far northeast)
*[[Lubombo District|Lubombo District, Eswatini]]       (northeast, east of Shiselweni)

{{see also|Parks of KwaZulu-Natal|List of cities and towns in KwaZulu-Natal|List of municipalities in KwaZulu-Natal}}

The KwaZulu-Natal Province is divided into one [[metropolitan municipality (South Africa)|metropolitan municipality]] and ten [[district municipality (South Africa)|district municipalities]]. The district municipalities are in turn divided into 44 [[local municipality (South Africa)|local municipalities]]. The local seat of each district municipality is given in parentheses:

In 2012, the [[Ingonyama Trust]] owns 32% of the land in KwaZulu-Natal, in many municipalities. This amounts to about three million hectares, occupied by over 4 million people. The Zulu king is the chairman of the Trust.

===Coastline===
[[File:Kznbeach.jpg|thumb|A beach on the North Coast]]
The coastline is dotted with small towns, many of which serve as seasonal recreational hubs. The climate of the coastal areas is humid and subtropical, comparable to southern Florida in the United States, but not quite as hot and rainy in the summer. As one moves further north up the coast towards the border of Mozambique, the climate becomes almost purely tropical. North of Durban is locally referred to as "[[KwaZulu-Natal North Coast|The North Coast]]", while south is "[[KwaZulu-Natal South Coast|The South Coast]]". The [https://archive.today/20030826015313/http://www.zulu.org.za/kzn Kwazulu-Natal Tourist board] includes towns such as [[Margate, South Africa|Margate]], [[Port Shepstone]], [[Scottburgh]] and [[Port Edward, KwaZulu-Natal|Port Edward]] in its definition of the South Coast, while [[Ballito]], [[UMhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal|uMhlanga]], [[Zimbali Coastal Forest|Zimbali]] and [[Salt Rock]] are North Coast resort towns.

[[File:San Lameer.jpg|thumb|San Lameer Resort]]

Beaches of world-class quality are to be found along virtually every part of South Africa's eastern seaboard, with some of the least-developed gems found in the far southern and far northern ends of the province. [[Marina Beach, KwaZulu-Natal|Marina Beach]] (and its adjoining resort San Lameer) was recognised in 2002 as a [[Blue Flag beach]].

Some visitors come for the annual late autumn or early winter phenomenon on the KwaZulu-Natal coast of the "[[sardine run]]". Referred to as "the greatest shoal on earth", the sardine run occurs when millions of [[sardine]]s migrate from their [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] grounds south of the southern tip of Africa northward along the [[Eastern Cape]] coastline toward KwaZulu-Natal. They follow a route close inshore, often resulting in many fish washing up on beaches. The huge shoal of tiny fish can stretch for many kilometres; it is preyed upon by thousands of predators, including [[game fish]], [[shark]]s, dolphins and [[seabird]]s. Usually, the shoals break up and the fish disappear into deeper water around Durban. Scientists have been unable to answer many questions surrounding this exceptional seasonal event.

===Interior===
The interior of the province consists largely of rolling hills from the [[Valley of a Thousand Hills]] to the [[KwaZulu-Natal Midlands|Midlands]]. Their beauty has inspired literature. [[Alan Paton]], in the novel ''[[Cry, the Beloved Country]]'', wrote:
{{blockquote
| There is a lovely road that runs from [[Ixopo]] into the hills. These hills are grass-covered and rolling, and they are lovely beyond any singing of it. The road climbs {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} into them, to Carisbrooke; and from there, if there is no mist, you look down on one of the fairest valleys of Africa. About you there is grass and bracken and you may hear the forlorn crying of the [[black-winged lapwing|titihoya]], one of the birds of the veld. Below you is the valley of the [[Umzimkulu River|Umzimkulu]], on its journey from the Drakensberg to the sea; and beyond and behind the river, great hill after great hill; and beyond and behind them, the mountains of Ingeli and [[Griqualand East]].

On [[Christmas]] Day 1497, Portuguese explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] saw the coast of Natal and named the site after the Portuguese word for Christmas, ''[[:wikt:Natal#Portuguese|Natal]]''. The [[Nguni people|Nguni]] branch of the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] occupied this area from the early 1300s<ref>{{cite web |title=Vasco da Gama's Voyage of 'Discovery' 1497 |url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/vasco-da-gamas-voyage-discovery-1497 |website=South African History Online |access-date=4 August 2020}}</ref>

The first European settlers, mostly British, established [[Port Natal]], a trading post. They made almost no attempt to develop the interior, whose inhabitants had been [[Mfecane|decimated]] by the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] king, [[Shaka]]. The [[Afrikaner]] [[Voortrekkers]] entered the area via the [[Drakensberg]] passes in 1837. These Afrikaners defeated the Zulus at the [[Battle of Blood River]] in 1838 and thereafter established the Republic of Natal. Thus, the territory was once part of a [[Natalia Republic|short-lived Boer republic]] between 1839 and 1843 until its annexation by Britain. Many Afrikaner inhabitants left for the interior after the annexation and were replaced by immigrants, mainly from Britain.

From 1860 onwards, increasing numbers of Indians, mainly [[Tamils]],<ref name="Watson1960">{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Robert George Theodor |title=Tongaati: an African experiment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8D01AQAAIAAJ|year=1960|publisher=Hutchinson|page=83}}</ref> were brought in by the British mainly to work in the sugar plantations on the coast. The colony acquired Zululand (the area north of the Tugela River) after the Zulu War of 1879. The lands north of the Buffalo River were added in 1902. [[Boer]] forces entered the area during the South African War (1899 to 1902){{spaced ndash}}also known as the second [[Boer War]]{{spaced ndash}}and laid siege to [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]]. They failed to build on their initial advantage and for three months the line between the opposing forces followed the course of the [[Tugela River]]. In 1910, the colony became a province of the Union of South Africa and in 1961 of the Republic of South Africa.

When the [[Homeland (South Africa)|homeland]] of KwaZulu, which means "Place of the Zulu" was re-incorporated into the Natal province after the end of [[apartheid]] in 1994, the province of Natal, which had existed between 1910 and 1994, was renamed KwaZulu-Natal. The province is home to the Zulu monarchy; the majority population speak [[Zulu language|Zulu]]. It is the only province in South Africa that has the name of its dominant ethnic group as part of its name. As with [[Eastern Cape]], most [[White South Africans]] in KwaZulu-Natal are of [[British diaspora in Africa|British descent]] and less than a quarter of whites in the province are of Boer/Afrikaner descent.<ref>South Africa as a Multi-Ethnic Society By Godfrey Mwakikagile pg. 136</ref><ref>South Africa and Its People By Godfrey Mwakikagile pg. 152</ref><ref>{{cite EB1922 |wstitle= Natal |volume=31 | pages = 1058&ndash;1059 |first=Frank Richardson |last=Cana |short=1}}</ref>

== Provincial coat of arms ==

The lion and [[wildebeest]] [[supporter]]s are symbols of, respectively, KwaZulu and Natal, the regions joined to create KwaZulu-Natal. Besides its importance as a symbol of the Zulu monarchy, the lion is also featured in the state emblems of the India and the United Kingdom which together represent the three largest people groups in KwaZulu-Natal and also represents the unity between them. The zig-zag stripe represents the [[Drakensberg]], which is green in summer, but snowcapped in winter.<ref name="sabooklet"/>

The star represents the [[Star of Bethlehem]], due to [[Vasco da Gama]] naming the region "Natalia", a reference to the birth of Christ, on Christmas Day in 1497. The [[strelitzia]] flower on the shield symbolizes the province's beauty. The [[assegai]] and [[knobkierrie]] behind the shield represent protection and peace. The base of the [[Crown (heraldry)|crown element]] is a type of headdress traditionally worn by Zulu elders, that represents wisdom and maturity. The element itself is a Zulu-style grass hut. The motto is ''Masisukume Sakhe'', Zulu for "Let us stand up and build".<ref name="sabooklet">''My country South Africa{{spaced ndash}}celebrating our national symbols and heritage'', Department of Education (South Africa), {{ISBN|1-77018-108-3}}.</ref>

== Law and government ==
[[File:KwaZulu-Natal Parliament building, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.jpg|thumb|The KwaZulu-Natal parliament building, located in [[Pietermaritzburg]]]]

===Provincial government===
KwaZulu-Natal's provincial government sits in [[Pietermaritzburg]]. The foundation stone of the new legislative building was laid on 21 June 1887, to commemorate [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria|Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee]]. The building was completed two years later. On 25 April 1889, the Governor of Natal, Sir [[Arthur Havelock]], opened the first Legislative Council session in the new building.

This was the former site of St Mary's Church, built in the 1860s. The congregation built a new church in 1884 at the corner of Burger Street and Commercial Road. The old building was demolished in 1887 to provide space for the legislative complex.

When governance was granted to Natal in 1893, the new Legislative Assembly took over the chamber used by the Legislative Council since 1889. Further extensions to the parliamentary building were made. The building was unoccupied until 1902, when it was used without being officially opened, due to the country's being engulfed in the [[Second Boer War|Anglo-Boer war]]. The war forced the Legislative Assembly to move the venue of its sittings, as its chamber was used as a military hospital.

The Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council buildings have both been protected as [[Provincial heritage site (South Africa)|provincial landmarks]]. They formed a colonial Parliament of two houses: a Council of 11 nominated members and an Assembly of 37 elected members. The Natal Parliament was disbanded in 1910 when the Union of South Africa was formed, and the Assembly became the meeting place of the Natal Provincial Council. The council was disbanded in 1986.

The [[KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Legislature|Provincial Legislature]] consists of 80 members.

===Current composition===
{{See also|2024 KwaZulu-Natal provincial election}}
The [[2024 KwaZulu-Natal provincial election|2024 election]] saw a major upheaval in KwaZulu-Natal's political landscape. The [[African National Congress]] (ANC), which had won a majority in the province in every election since [[2004 South African general election|2004]], saw its vote collapse by nearly two-thirds, down to 17% and in third place.  In contrast, [[UMkhonto we Sizwe (political party)|uMkhonto we Sizwe]], a new party led by former President [[Jacob Zuma]], became the province's largest party, winning 45% of the vote, primarily among the province's ethnic [[Zulu people|Zulu]] majority.  After the election, the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]] (IFP), which previously had been the province's official opposition party, formed a coalition government with the ANC, the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] (DA), and the [[National Freedom Party]].  As part of the coalition agreement, the IFP's [[Thami Ntuli]] became [[Premier of KwaZulu-Natal|premier]], making him the first IFP member to hold the position in twenty years.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/kzn-premier/|title=IFP's Thami Ntuli elected as new KZN Premier|first=Minoahni|last=Pilay|publisher=SABC|date=14 June 2024|accessdate=14 June 2024}}</ref>{{Election results|image=[[File:South_Africa_KwaZulu-Natal_Parliament_2024.svg]]|party1=[[uMkhonto we Sizwe (political party)|uMkhonto we Sizwe]]|votes1=1590813|sw1=New|seats1=37|sc1=New|party2=[[Inkatha Freedom Party]]|votes2=633771|sw2={{increase}} 2.73|seats2=15|sc2={{increase}} 2|party3=[[African National Congress]]|votes3=595958|sw3={{decrease}} 27.23|seats3=14|sc3={{decrease}} 30|party4=[[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]]|votes4=468515|sw4={{decrease}} 0.54|seats4=11|sc4={{steady}} 0|party5=[[Economic Freedom Fighters]]|votes5=79211|sw5={{decrease}} 7.65|seats5=2|sc5={{decrease}} 6|party6=[[National Freedom Party]]|party7=Moodley Thanasagren Rubbanathan|votes6=19548|votes7=12323|sw6={{decrease}} 1.01|sw7=New|seats7=0|seats6=1|sc6={{steady}} 0|sc7=New|party8=[[African Christian Democratic Party]]|party9=[[ActionSA]]|party10=[[Allied Movement for Change]]|party11=[[Patriotic Alliance]]|votes8=11366|votes9=9569|votes10=8007|votes11=7843|sw8={{decrease}} 0.16|sw9=New|sw10=New|sw11=New|seats8=0|seats9=0|seats10=0|seats11=0|sc8={{decrease}} 1|sc9=New|sc10=New|sc11=New|seats12=0|seats13=0|seats14=0|seats15=0|seats16=0|party12=[[African Transformation Movement]]|party13=[[Democratic Liberal Congress]]|party14=[[Al Jama-ah]]|party15=[[Freedom Front Plus]]|party16=[[Build One South Africa]]|votes12=6477|votes13=6126|votes14=6012|votes15=5638|votes16=4648|sw12={{decrease}} 0.31|sw13={{decrease}} 0.21|sw14={{decrease}} 0.11|sw15={{decrease}} 0.15|sw16=New|sc12={{decrease}} 1|sc13={{steady}} 0|sc14={{steady}} 0|sc15={{steady}} 0|sc16=New|party17=[[African People's Movement]]|party18=[[Rise Mzansi]]|party19=[[Pan Africanist Congress of Azania]]|party20=Justice and Employment Party|votes17=4117|votes18=3898|votes19=3817|votes20=3626|sw17=New|sw18=New|sw19={{increase}} 0.04|sw20={{decrease}} 0.13|seats17=0|seats18=0|seats19=0|seats20=0|sc17=New|sc18=New|sc19={{steady}} 0|sc20={{steady}} 0|party21=[[Congress of the People (South African political party)|Congress of the People]]|party22=[[Abantu Batho Congress]]|party23=People's Freedom Party|party24=[[Sizwe Ummah Nation]]|party25=[[United Democratic Movement]]|votes21=3615|votes23=3162|votes24=2731|votes25=2565|sw21={{decrease}} 0.04|sw22=New|sw23=New|sw24=New|sw25={{decrease}} 0.03|seats21=0|seats22=0|seats23=0|seats24=0|seats25=0|sc21={{steady}} 0|sc22=New|sc23=New|sc24=New|sc25={{steady}} 0|votes22=3214|party26=[[African Independent Congress]]|party27=African Movement Congress|party28=[[Good (political party)|Good]]|party29=Arise SA|party30=African People First|party31=Economic Liberators Forum South Africa|party32=All Citizens Party|party33=[[Africa Restoration Alliance]]|votes26=2527|votes27=2049|votes28=2005|votes29=1958|votes30=1007|votes31=679|votes32=631|votes33=629|sw26={{decrease}} 0.19|sw27=New|sw28={{decrease}} 0.05|sw29=New|sw30=New|sw31=New|sw32=New|sw33=New|seats26=0|seats27=0|seats28=0|seats29=0|seats30=0|seats31=0|seats32=0|seats33=0|sc26={{steady}} 0|sc27=New|sc28={{steady}} 0|sc29=New|sc30=New|sc31=New|sc32=New|sc33=New|electorate=5738249|invalid=39761|source=[https://results.elections.org.za/home/NPEPublicReports/1335/Results%20Report/KN/KN.pdf Electoral Commission of South Africa]}}

===Zulu monarchy===
KwaZulu-Natal is the home to the [[List of Zulu kings|Zulu monarch]], currently King [[Misuzulu Zulu]] kaZwelithini. {{As of|2015}}, the [[King of the Zulu Nation]] is provided a stipend of 54 million [[South African rand]]s by the provincial government.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/11647084/How-South-African-Zulu-kings-spending-drove-his-purse-holder-to-madness.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/11647084/How-South-African-Zulu-kings-spending-drove-his-purse-holder-to-madness.html |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=How South African Zulu king's spending drove his purse-holder to madness|last=Laing|first=Aislinn|date=2 June 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|access-date=16 September 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref> He is also the chairman of the [[Ingonyama Trust]], which controls 32% of the area of the province.

== Economy ==
[[File:Sugar Cane in Midlands South.jpg|thumb|Sugar cane in Midlands South.]]
KwaZulu-Natal has the second largest regional economy in the country after [[Gauteng]]. [[Durban]] is a rapidly growing urban area and is by most measures the busiest port in Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.5stardurban.co.za/durban-africas-eastern-gem/|title=Durban, Africa's Eastern Gem - 5 Star Durban - Showcasing Beautiful KwaZulu-Natal|date=9 January 2015|website=5stardurban.co.za}}</ref> A good railway network links the city to other areas of Southern Africa.

Sugar refining is Durban's main industry. Sheep, cattle, dairy, [[citrus]] fruits, [[maize|corn]], [[sorghum]], cotton, bananas, and [[pineapple]]s are also raised. There is an embryonic KwaZulu-Natal wine industry. Other industries, located mainly in and around Durban, include textile, clothing, [[chemicals]], rubber, [[fertiliser]], paper, vehicle assembly and food-processing plants, tanneries, and [[Petroleum|oil]] refineries.

To the north, [[Newcastle, KwaZulu-Natal|Newcastle]] is the province's industrial powerhouse, with [[Mittal Steel South Africa]] (previously ISPAT/ISCOR) and the Karbochem [[synthetic rubber]] plant dominating the economy. In 2002, Newcastle became the largest producer of chrome chemicals in Africa with the completion of a chrome-chemical plant, a joint-venture project between Karbochem and German manufacturing giant Bayer.

Other large operations include a diamond-cutting works, various heavy engineering concerns, the Natal Portland Cement (NPC) slagment cement factory, and the Newcastle Cogeneration Plant (old Ingagane Power Station). This was recommissioned as Africa's first gas-fired power station by Independent Power Southern Africa (IPSA), and it supplies the Karbochem Plant with electricity. The textile industry is a major employer in the Newcastle area, with over 100 factories belonging to ethnic Taiwanese and Chinese industrialists. Maize, livestock and dairy farmers operate on the outskirts of the city. Coal is mined in the Newcastle area.

Offshore mining of [[Heavy mineral sands ore deposits|heavy mineral sands]] including minerals with a concentration of significant economic importance at several locations, such as [[rutile]], [[ilmenite]] and [[zircon]] are threatening the marine ecology of KwaZulu-Natal's coast, including the Tugela Banks. The fishing economy of the prawn and nurse fisheries are also threatened.<ref>[http://www.rbm.co.za/about/rbm_history.php Richards Bay Minerals: ''History'', www.rbm.co.za] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531083929/http://rbm.co.za/about/rbm_history.php |date=31 May 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sacoast.ioisa.org.za/education/sacoast/regional/zululand.asp |title=South African Coastal Information Centre: ''The Zululand coastal region...''. www.sacoast.ioisa.org.za |access-date=8 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508224705/http://sacoast.ioisa.org.za/education/sacoast/regional/zululand.asp |archive-date=8 May 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Ecology tourism is increasingly important to the economy of KwaZulu-Natal. The area's rich biodiversity and efforts at conservation have been recognised. Tourists have come to see the [[iSimangaliso Wetland Park]] and the [[uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park]], declared [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]]. These two major parks and that of Ndumo have [[wetlands]] of international importance listed as [[Ramsar sites]] for conservation.

There are various game reserves found in the province; one notable example is [[Hluhluwe–Imfolozi Park]], where the [[southern white rhinoceros]] was saved from extinction.

In many of these larger reserves, large animals ranging from several [[antelope]] species to [[African bush elephant|elephant]], [[African buffalo|Cape buffalo]] and [[hippopotamus]] can be found. Predators include [[Panthera leo melanochaita|lion]]s, [[African leopard|leopard]]s, and [[Cape wild dog]]s.

The [[scaly yellowfish]] (''Labeobarbus natalensis'') is a fish found in the [[Tugela River]] system as well as in the [[Umzimkulu River|Umzimkulu]], [[Umfolozi River|Umfolozi]] and the [[Mgeni River|Mgeni]].
