Leipzig is located about {{cvt|150|km|-1}} southwest of Berlin, in the southernmost part of the [[North German Plain]] (the [[Leipzig Bay]]), at the confluence of the [[White Elster]] and its tributaries [[Pleiße]] and [[Parthe]], that form an extensive inland delta in the city known as ''{{ill|Leipziger Gewässerknoten|de}}'', along which [[Leipzig Riverside Forest]], Europe's largest intra-city [[riparian forest]] has developed. Leipzig is at the centre of [[Neuseenland]] (''new lake district''), consisting of several artificial lakes created from former lignite [[Open-pit_mining|open-pit mines]].

Events in Leipzig in 1989 played a significant role in precipitating the [[fall of communism]] in [[Central Europe|Central]] and Eastern Europe, mainly through [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|demonstrations]] starting from [[St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig|St. Nicholas Church]]. The immediate effects of the [[reunification of Germany]] included the collapse of the local economy (which had come to depend on highly polluting [[heavy industry]]), severe unemployment, and urban blight. By the early [[2000s]] the trend had reversed, and since then Leipzig has undergone some significant changes, including urban and economic rejuvenation, and modernisation of the transport infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.leipzig.de/de/business/invest/infrastrukt/ |title=Infrastruktur |work=leipzig.de |access-date=13 October 2023 |archive-date=20 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320183356/http://www.leipzig.de/de/business/invest/infrastrukt/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Power-2016" />

Leipzig is home to one of the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest universities]] in Europe ([[Leipzig University]]).

Leipzig has long been a major centre for music, including classical and modern [[dark wave]]. The [[Thomanerchor]] (English: St. Thomas Choir of Leipzig), a boys' choir, was founded in 1212. The [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]], established in 1743, is one of the oldest symphony orchestras in the world. Several well-known composers lived and worked in Leipzig, including [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1723 to 1750) and [[Felix Mendelssohn]] (1835 to 1847). The [[University of Music and Theatre Leipzig|University of Music and Theatre "Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy"]] was founded in 1843. The [[Leipzig Opera|Oper Leipzig]], one of the most prominent opera houses in Germany, was founded in 1693. During a stay in [[Gohlis]], which is now part of the city, [[Friedrich Schiller]] wrote his poem "[[Ode to Joy]]".

==Names==

An older spelling of Leipzig in English is '''{{lang|ang|Leipsic}}'''. The [[Latin]] name '''{{lang|la|Lipsia}}''' was also used.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mmh.cz/lingua/lamj_la |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120714185917/http://mmh.cz/lingua/lamj_la |url-status=dead |title=Lexicum nominum geographicorum latinorum |date=14 July 2012 |archive-date=14 July 2012}}</ref>

===Etymology===
The name ''Leipzig'' is commonly held to derive from ''lipa'', the common [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] designation for [[Tilia|linden trees]], making the city's name etymologically related to [[Lipetsk|Lipetsk, Russia]] and [[Liepāja|Liepaja, Latvia]]. Based on medieval attestations like ''Lipzk'' (c. 1190), the original Slavic name of the city has been reconstructed as ''*Lipьsko'', which is also reflected in similar forms in neighbouring modern Slavic languages (Sorbian/Polish ''Lipsk'', Czech ''Lipsko''). This has, however, been questioned by more recent [[Onomastics|onomastic]] research based on the very oldest forms like ''Libzi'' (c. 1015).<ref>The very oldest written evidence (11th/12th c.) consistently shows forms like ''Libzi'' (first mention of Leipzig, 1015) whose ''-b-'' is difficult to reconcile with ''lipa''. Also, the ending ''-zi'' points to a plural personal name (roughly, "at the [X] people's place"), not the suffix ''-sko''. Karlheinz Hengst offered a Slavic root ''lib-'' as a possible source, which can mean "to waver, to sway, to wobble" (as in swampy ground?) or "thin, skinny, weak" (as in a thin piece of dry land?). Both roots, however, lack almost any attestation in other Slavic toponyms. Ultimately, it might be a pre-Slavic root (perhaps related to [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''*leiH-'' "to pour, to flow, to drip", referring to the many streams around the city centre) that was enlarged with a Slavic suffix (''-ьcy'', ''-ica'' or the like). Even later, during early German colonization, the name seems to have been reinterpreted with the much more common ''lipa'' "linden tree", in accordance with the etymology commonly held today. Cf. Hengst, Karlheinz (2010). "Der Name Leipzig". In Eichler, Ernst; Walther, Hans (eds.). ''Alt-Leipzig und das Leipziger Land. Ein historisch-geographisches Namenbuch zur Frühzeit im Elster-Pleißen-Land im Rahmen der Sprach- und Siedlungsgeschichte. Leipzig: Universitätsverlag''. pp. 134–140; Walther, Hans (2010). "Leipzigs Name im Lichte seiner Frühüberlieferung". Ibid. pp. 129–133.</ref>

===Epithets===
Due to the etymology mentioned above, ''Lindenstadt'' or ''Stadt der Linden'' (City of Linden Trees) are common poetic epithets for the city.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hartinger |first1=Anselm |title=Zwischen Lindenstadt und Hypezig |url=https://www.stadtgeschichtliches-museum-leipzig.de/blog/2021/06/17/zwischen-lindenstadt-und-hypezig/ |website=Stadtgeschichtliches Museum Leipzig |access-date=2 July 2024 |date=17 June 2021}}</ref>

Another, somewhat old-fashioned epithet is ''Pleiß-Athen'' ([[History of Athens|Athens]] on the [[Pleiße|Pleiße River]]), hinting at Leipzig's long academic and literary tradition, as the seat of one of the oldest German universities and a centre of the book trade.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Löffler |editor1-first=Katrin |title=Als Studiosus in Pleiß-Athen. Erinnerungen von Leipziger Studenten des 18. Jahrhunderts |date=2009 |publisher=Lehmstedt |location=Leipzig}}</ref>

It is also referred to as "Little Paris" (''Klein-Paris'') after [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Johann Wolfgang Goethe]]'s ''[[Faust, Part One|Faust I]]'', which is partly set in the famous Leipzig restaurant ''[[Auerbachs Keller]]''.

In 1937 the [[Nazis|Nazi]] government officially renamed the city ''{{lang|de|Reichsmessestadt Leipzig}}'' (Reich Trade Fair City Leipzig).<ref name="Rolf Jehke">{{cite web |url=http://territorial.de/sachsen/leipzig/stadtkrs.htm |title=Stadtkreis Leipzig |author=Rolf Jehke |work=territorial.de |access-date=15 December 2013 |archive-date=18 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418182000/http://territorial.de/sachsen/leipzig/stadtkrs.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1989 Leipzig was dubbed a [[Hero City (Soviet Union)|Hero City]] (''Heldenstadt''), alluding to the honorary title awarded in the former Soviet Union to certain cities that played a key role in the victory of the Allies during the Second World War, in recognition of the role that the [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|Monday demonstrations]] there played in the fall of the East German regime.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wissenschaft.de/magazin/weitere-themen/heldenstadt-leipzig/ |title=Heldenstadt Leipzig |date=18 September 2019 |publisher=wissenschaft.de |access-date=13 October 2023 |archive-date=16 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231016001031/https://www.wissenschaft.de/magazin/weitere-themen/heldenstadt-leipzig/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

More recently, the city has sometimes been nicknamed ''Hypezig'', the "Boomtown of eastern Germany", or "The better Berlin" (''Das bessere Berlin'') and is celebrated by the media as a hip urban centre for its vibrant lifestyle and creative scene with many [[startup company|startups]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.zeit.de/lebensart/2013-10/leipzig-hypezig-gentrifizierung-wohnkonzepte-stadtentwicklung |title=Kann Leipzig Hypezig überleben? |trans-title=Can Leipzig live up to the Hypezig? |work=[[Die Zeit]] |date=1 October 2013 |language=de |access-date=20 November 2013 |archive-date=22 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722041259/https://www.zeit.de/lebensart/2013-10/leipzig-hypezig-gentrifizierung-wohnkonzepte-stadtentwicklung |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Handelsblatt-2013">{{cite news |url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/panorama/lifestyle/hypezig-leipzig-mutiert-zur-szenemetropole/8880718.html |title=Hypezig – Leipzig mutiert zur Szenemetropole |trans-title=Hypezig – Leipzig mutates into a fashionable metropolis |work=[[Handelsblatt]] |date=3 October 2013 |language=de |access-date=8 March 2017 |archive-date=20 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141120135712/http://www.handelsblatt.com/panorama/lifestyle/hypezig-leipzig-mutiert-zur-szenemetropole/8880718.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Wiemann-2014">{{cite web |last=Wiemann |first=Mareike |title=Mehr Geburten als Sterbefälle: Leipzig boomt entgegen dem Deutschlandtrend |trans-title=More births than deaths: Leipzig is booming against the German trend |url=http://www.mdr.de/mdr-info/geburten-in-leipzig100.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222171333/http://www.mdr.de/mdr-info/geburten-in-leipzig100.html |date=5 January 2014 |publisher=[[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk]] |archive-date=22 December 2014 |access-date= 23 September 2016 |language=de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/leipzig-vs--berlin--natuerlich-ist-leipzig-das-bessere-berlin-,10809148,22704586.html |title=Leipzig vs Berlin: "Natürlich ist Leipzig das bessere Berlin" |trans-title=Leipzig vs Berlin: Naturally Leipzig is the better Berlin |author=Marcel Burkhardt |work=[[Berliner Zeitung]] |date=4 February 2020 |access-date=7 September 2014 |archive-date=2 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102065221/http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/leipzig-vs--berlin--natuerlich-ist-leipzig-das-bessere-berlin-,10809148,22704586.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Location===
Leipzig is located in the [[Leipzig Bay]], the southernmost part of the [[North German Plain]], which is the part of the [[North European Plain]] in Germany. The city sits on the [[White Elster]], a river that rises in the [[Czech Republic]] and flows into the [[Saale]] south of Halle. The [[Pleiße]] and the [[Parthe]] join the White Elster in Leipzig, and the large inland delta-like landscape the three rivers form is called ''Leipziger Gewässerknoten''. The site is characterized by swampy areas such as the [[Leipzig Riverside Forest|Leipzig Riparian Forest]] (''Leipziger Auenwald''), though there are also some limestone areas to the north of the city. The landscape is mostly flat, though there is also some evidence of [[moraine]] and [[drumlin]]s.

Although there are some forest parks within the city limits, the area surrounding Leipzig is relatively unforested. During the 20th century, there were several open-pit mines in the region, many of which have been converted to lakes.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Untersuchung zum Landschaftswandel im Südraum Leipzig |journal=Standort |date=1 December 2002 |issn=0174-3635 |pages=159–165 |volume=26 |issue=4 |doi=10.1007/s00548-002-0103-3 |language=de |first1=Dagmar |last1=Haase |first2=Matthias |last2=Rosenberg |first3=Robert |last3=Mikutta |s2cid=68472430}}</ref> Also see: [[Neuseenland]]

Leipzig is also situated at the intersection of the [[ancient road]]s known as the [[Via Regia]] (King's highway), which traversed Germany in an east–west direction, and the [[Via Imperii]] (Imperial highway), a north–south road.

Leipzig was a walled city in the Middle Ages and [[Inner City Ring Road (Leipzig)|the current "ring" road around the historic centre]] of the city follows the line of the old city walls.

===Subdivision===
{{See also|Boroughs and localities of Leipzig}}
Since 1992 Leipzig has been divided administratively into ten ''Stadtbezirke'' (boroughs), which in turn contain a total of 63 ''Ortsteile'' (localities). Some of these correspond to outlying villages which have been annexed by Leipzig.

===Climate===
Like many cities in Eastern Germany, Leipzig has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''), with significant [[continental climate|continental]] influences due to its inland location. Winters are cold, with an average temperature of around {{cvt|1|°C|°F|sigfig=2}}. Summers are generally warm, averaging at {{cvt|19|°C|°F|sigfig=2}} with daytime temperatures of {{cvt|24|°C|°F|sigfig=2}}. Precipitation in winter is about half that of the summer. The amount of sunshine differs significantly between winter and summer, with an average of around 51 hours of sunshine in December (1.7 hours per day) compared with 229 hours of sunshine in July (7.4 hours per day).<ref>{{cite web |title=Climatological maps of Germany |url=https://www.dwd.de/EN/ourservices/klimakartendeutschland/klimakartendeutschland.html?nn=519080 |website=DWD: Deutscher Wetterdienst |publisher=Deutscher Wetterdienst (German Weather Service) |access-date=25 February 2019 |archive-date=22 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210522015856/https://www.dwd.de/EN/ourservices/klimakartendeutschland/klimakartendeutschland.html?nn=519080 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Leipzig 1632.jpg|thumb|Leipzig in the 17th century]]
Leipzig was first documented in 1015 in the chronicles of Bishop [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] as ''{{lang|la|urbs Libzi}}'' ({{lang|la|Chronicon}}, VII, 25) and endowed with city and market privileges in 1165 by [[Otto II, Margrave of Meissen|Otto the Rich]]. [[Leipzig Trade Fair]], started in the [[Middle Ages]], has become an event of international importance and is the oldest surviving trade fair in the world. This encouraged the grewing of the [[Leipzig merchant bourgeoisie]].

There are records of commercial fishing operations on the river [[Pleiße]] that, most likely, refer to Leipzig dating back to 1305, when the [[Margrave]] Dietrich the Younger granted the fishing rights to the church and convent of St Thomas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neue-ufer.de/leipzig/pleisse_geschichte_fischerei.asp |title=Pleißemühlgraben: Geschichte der Fischerei |publisher=Neue-ufer.de |access-date=26 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402161141/http://www.neue-ufer.de/leipzig/pleisse_geschichte_fischerei.asp |archive-date=2 April 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

There were a number of [[monastery|monasteries]] in and around the city, including a [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] monastery after which the [[Barfußgäßchen]] (Barefoot Alley) is named and a monastery of Irish monks ({{lang|de|Jacobskirche}}, destroyed in 1544) near the present day {{lang|de|Ranstädter Steinweg}} (the old ''{{lang|la|[[Via Regia]]}}'').

The [[University of Leipzig]] was founded in 1409 and Leipzig developed into an important centre of German law and of the publishing industry in Germany, resulting, in the 19th and 20th centuries, with the [[Reichsgericht]] (Imperial Court of Justice) and the [[German National Library]] being located here.

During the [[Thirty Years' War]], two battles took place in {{lang|de|[[Breitenfeld, Leipzig|Breitenfeld]]}}, about {{cvt|8|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} outside Leipzig city walls. The [[Battle of Breitenfeld (1631)|first Battle of Breitenfeld]] took place in 1631 and [[Battle of Breitenfeld (1642)|the second]] in 1642. Both battles resulted in victories for the Swedish-led side.

On 24 December 1701, when [[Franz Conrad Romanus]] was mayor, an oil-fueled [[street light]]ing system was introduced. The city employed light guards who had to follow a specific schedule to ensure the punctual lighting of the 700 lanterns.

===19th century===
[[File:Battle of Leipzig by Zauerweid.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Leipzig]], 1813]]
The Leipzig region was the arena of the 1813 [[Battle of Leipzig]] between [[Napoleonic France]] and an allied coalition of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], Austria and Sweden. It was the largest battle in Europe before the [[First World War]] and the coalition victory ended [[Napoleon]]'s presence in Germany and would ultimately lead to his first exile on [[Elba]]. The [[Monument to the Battle of the Nations]] celebrating the centenary of this event was completed in 1913. In addition to stimulating German nationalism, the war had a major impact in mobilizing a civic spirit in numerous volunteer activities. Many volunteer militias and civic associations were formed, and collaborated with churches and the press to support local and state militias, patriotic wartime mobilization, humanitarian relief and postwar commemorative practices and rituals.<ref>Katherine Aaslestad, "Cities and War: Modern Military Urbanism in Hamburg and Leipzig during the Napoleonic Era." ''German History'' 35.3 (2017): 381–402.</ref>

When it was made a terminus of the first German long-distance railway to [[Dresden]] (the capital of Saxony) in 1839, Leipzig became a hub of Central European railway traffic, with [[Leipzig Hauptbahnhof]] the largest [[terminal station]] by area in Europe. The railway station has two grand entrance halls, the eastern one for the [[Royal Saxon State Railways]] and the western one for the [[Prussian state railways]].

In the 19th century, Leipzig was a centre of the German and Saxon liberal movements.<ref>{{cite EB9 |wstitle = Leipsic |volume= XIV |last1= Muirhead |first1= James Fullarton |author1-link= James Fullarton Muirhead | pages = 429–431 |short=1}}</ref> The first German [[List of Labour Parties|labor party]], the [[General German Workers' Association]] (''Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein'', ADAV) was founded in Leipzig on 23 May 1863 by [[Ferdinand Lassalle]]; about 600 workers from across Germany travelled to the foundation on the new railway. Leipzig expanded rapidly to more than 700,000 inhabitants. Huge {{Lang|de|[[Gründerzeit]]}} areas were built, which mostly survived both war and post-war demolition.

With the opening of a fifth production hall in 1907, the [[Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei]] became the largest [[cotton mill]] company on the continent, housing over 240,000 spindles. Yearly production surpassed 5&nbsp;million kilograms of yarn.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spinnerei.de/the-heady-early-days.html |title=The heady early days |website=spinnerei.de |language=de |last=Müller-Stahl |first=Karoline |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190612012317/http://www.spinnerei.de/the-heady-early-days.html |archive-date=12 June 2019}}</ref>

During [[World War I]], in 1917, the American Consulate was closed, and its building became a temporary place of stay for Americans and [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] refugees from [[Serbia]], [[Romania]] and [[Japan]].<ref name=usem>{{cite web|url=https://de.usembassy.gov/leipzig-history/|title=Brief history|website=U.S. Embassy & Consulates in Germany|date=18 April 2018|access-date=7 November 2022|archive-date=6 October 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221006175121/https://de.usembassy.gov/leipzig-history/|url-status=live}}</ref>

During the 1930s and 1940s, music was prominent throughout Leipzig. Many students attended [[University of Music and Theatre Leipzig|Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy College of Music and Theatre]] (then named Landeskonservatorium.) However, in 1944, it was closed due to [[World War II]]. It re-opened soon after the war ended in 1945.

On 22 May 1930, [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler]] was elected mayor of Leipzig. He later became an opponent of the [[Nazi Regime|Nazi regime]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gdw-berlin.de/en/recess/biographies/index_of_persons/biographie/view-bio/carl-friedrich-goerdeler/?no_cache=1 |title=German Resistance Memorial Center – Biographie |last=Center |first=German Resistance Memorial |website=www.gdw-berlin.de |language=en |access-date=3 May 2018 |archive-date=26 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210126032830/https://www.gdw-berlin.de/en/recess/biographies/index_of_persons/biographie/view-bio/carl-friedrich-goerdeler/?no_cache=1 |url-status=live }}</ref> He resigned in 1937 when, in his absence, his Nazi deputy ordered the destruction of the city's statue of [[Felix Mendelssohn]]. On [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, the 1855 [[Moorish Revival]] [[Leipzig synagogue]], one of the city's most architecturally significant buildings, was deliberately destroyed. [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler|Goerdeler]] was later executed by the Nazis on 2 February 1945.

Several thousand forced labourers were stationed in Leipzig during the Second World War.

Beginning in 1933, many Jewish citizens of Leipzig were members of the [[Gemeinde (Germany)|Gemeinde]], a large Jewish religious community spread throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In October 1935, the Gemeinde helped found the Lehrhaus (English: a house of study) in Leipzig to provide different forms of studies to Jewish students who were prohibited from attending any institutions in Germany. Jewish studies were emphasized and much of the Jewish community of Leipzig became involved.<ref name="Willingham">Willingham, Robert, and Crew, David F. ''Jews in Leipzig: Nationality and Community in the 20th Century'', 2005, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. Pgs. 1–148</ref>

Like all other cities claimed by the Nazis, Leipzig was subject to [[Aryanization (Nazism)|aryanisation]]. Beginning in 1933 and increasing in 1939, Jewish business owners were forced to give up their possessions and stores. This eventually intensified to the point where Nazi officials were strong enough to evict the Jews from their own homes. They also had the power to force many of the Jews living in the city to sell their houses. Many people who sold their homes emigrated elsewhere, outside of Leipzig. Others moved to Judenhäuser, which were smaller houses that acted as ghettos, housing large groups of people.<ref name="Willingham"/>

The Jews of Leipzig were greatly affected by the [[Nuremberg Laws]]. However, due to the [[Leipzig Trade Fair]] and the international attention it garnered, Leipzig was especially cautious about its public image. Despite this, the Leipzig authorities were not afraid to strictly apply and enforce anti-semitic measures.<ref name="Willingham" />

On 20 December 1937, after the Nazis took control of the city, they renamed it Reichsmessestadt Leipzig, meaning the "Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig".<ref name="Rolf Jehke"/> In early 1938, Leipzig saw an increase in [[Zionism]] through Jewish citizens.

In 1933, a census recorded that over 11,000 Jews were living in Leipzig. In the 1939 census, the number had fallen to roughly 4,500, and by January 1942 only 2,000 remained. In that month, these 2,000 Jews began to be deported.<ref name="Willingham"/> On 13 July 1942, 170 Jews were deported from Leipzig to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. On 19 September 1942, 440 Jews were deported from Leipzig to [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]]. On 18 June 1943, the remaining 18 Jews still in Leipzig were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz. According to records of the two waves of deportations to Auschwitz there were no survivors.

During World War II, Leipzig was [[Bombing of Leipzig in World War II|repeatedly struck]] by [[Strategic bombing during World War II|Allied bombing raids]], beginning in 1943 and lasting until 1945. The first raid occurred on the morning of 4 December 1943, when 442 bombers of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) dropped a total amount of almost 1,400 tons of explosives and incendiaries on the city, destroying large parts of the city centre.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://english.leipzig.de/services-and-administration/history/ |title=History |website=english.leipzig.de |language=en |access-date=2 May 2018 |archive-date=10 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191010155546/https://english.leipzig.de/services-and-administration/history/ |url-status=live }}</ref> This bombing was the largest up to that time. Due to the close proximity of many of the buildings hit, a firestorm occurred. This prompted firefighters to rush to the city; however, they were unable to control the fires. Unlike the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|firebombing of the neighbouring city of Dresden]], this was a largely conventional bombing with high explosives rather than incendiaries. The resultant pattern of loss was a patchwork, rather than wholesale loss of its centre, but was nevertheless extensive.

The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Leipzig in late April 1945. The U.S. [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] and U.S. [[69th Infantry Division (United States)|69th Infantry Division]] fought their way into the city on 18 April and completed its capture after fierce urban action, in which fighting was often house-to-house and block-to-block, on 19 April 1945.<ref>Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939–1946'' (Revised Edition, 2006), Stackpole Books, p. 78, 139.</ref> In April 1945, the Mayor of Leipzig, SS-''[[Gruppenführer]]'' [[Alfred Freyberg]], his wife and daughter, together with Deputy Mayor and City Treasurer Ernest Kurt Lisso, his wife, daughter and ''[[Volkssturm]]'' Major and former Mayor Walter Dönicke, all committed suicide in Leipzig City Hall.

The United States turned the city over to the [[Red Army]] as it pulled back from the [[line of contact]] with Soviet forces in July 1945 to the designated occupation zone boundaries. Leipzig became one of the major cities of the German Democratic Republic ([[East Germany]]).

Following the [[End of World War II in Europe|end of World War II]] in 1945, Leipzig saw a slow return of Jews to the city.<ref name="Willingham"/><ref>Ausschuß der Deutschen Statisker, P 136-142.

In the mid-20th century, the city's trade fair assumed renewed importance as a point of contact with the [[Comecon]] Eastern Europe economic bloc, of which [[East Germany]] was a member. At this time, trade fairs were held at a site in the south of the city, near the [[Monument to the Battle of the Nations]].

The planned economy of the German Democratic Republic, however, was not kind to Leipzig. Before the Second World War, Leipzig had developed a mixture of industry, creative business (notably publishing), and services (including legal services). During the period of the German Democratic Republic, services became the concern of the state, concentrated in [[East Berlin]]; creative business moved to [[West Germany]]; and Leipzig was left only with heavy industry. To make matters worse, this industry was extremely polluting, making Leipzig an even less attractive city to live in.<ref name="TheProtoCity.com-2014">{{Cite web |url=http://theprotocity.com/leipzig-back-growth-everyone/ |title=Leipzig: Back to Growth, but Not for Everyone |date=25 August 2014 |website=TheProtoCity.com |language=en-US |access-date=26 October 2019 |archive-date=29 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201029074413/http://theprotocity.com/leipzig-back-growth-everyone/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Between 1950 and the end of the German Democratic Republic, the population of Leipzig fell from 600,000 to 500,000.<ref name="Power-2016">{{Cite web |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/67845/1/casereport107.pdf |title=Leipzig City Story |last=Power |first=Anne and Elineen Herden |date=May 2016 |website=LSE Housing and Communities |access-date=26 October 2019 |archive-date=21 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210121160900/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/67845/1/casereport107.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

The centrally planned heavy industry that had become the city's specialty was, in terms of the advanced economy of reunited Germany, almost completely unviable, and closed. Within only six years, 90% of jobs in industry had vanished.<ref name="Power-2016" /> As unemployment rocketed, the population fell dramatically; some 100,000 people left Leipzig in the ten years after reunification, and vacant and derelict housing became an urgent problem.<ref name="Power-2016" />

Starting in 2000, an ambitious urban-renewal plan first stopped Leipzig's population decline and then reversed it. The plan focused on saving and improving the city's attractive historic downtown area and particularly its early 20th century building stock, and attracting new industries, partly through infrastructure improvement. However, the renewal has led to [[gentrification]] of parts of the city and has not arrested the decline of Leipzig-East.<ref name="TheProtoCity.com-2014" /><ref name="Power-2016" />

==Politics==
===Mayor===
[[File:2020 Leipzig mayoral election (2nd round).svg|thumb|350px|Results of the second round of the 2020 mayoral election]]
The first freely elected mayor after German reunification was [[Hinrich Lehmann-Grube]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD), who served from 1990 to 1998. The mayor was originally chosen by the city council, but since 1994 has been directly elected. [[Wolfgang Tiefensee]], also of the SDP, served from 1998 until his resignation in 2005 to become federal Minister of Transport. He was succeeded by fellow SPD politician [[Burkhard Jung]], who was elected in January 2006 and re-elected in 2013 and 2020. The most recent mayoral election was held on 2 February 2020, with a runoff held on 1 March, and the results were as follows:

It decreased steadily from 1950 to about 530,000 in 1989. In the 1990s, the population decreased rather rapidly to 437,000 in 1998. This reduction was mostly due to outward migration and suburbanisation.

In the years following German reunification, many people of working age took the opportunity to move to the states of the former West Germany to seek employment opportunities. This was a contributory factor to falling birth rates.

==Culture, sights and cityscape==
In the 2010s, Leipzig was often referred to as ''Hypezig'', as overblown comparisons were made to 1990s and early 2000s Berlin. The affordability, diversity and openness of the city have attracted many young people from across Europe, leading to a trendsetting alternative atmosphere, resulting in an innovative music, dance and art scene.<ref name="Warum Leipzig der beste Ort für kreative Experimente ist-2019">{{Cite web |url=https://i-d.vice.com/de/article/j5yx87/leipzig-kreative-balance-club-culture |title=Warum Leipzig der beste Ort für kreative Experimente ist |date=13 August 2019 |access-date=20 June 2021 |archive-date=28 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210628005657/https://i-d.vice.com/de/article/j5yx87/leipzig-kreative-balance-club-culture |url-status=live }}</ref>

The historic central area of Leipzig features a [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance-style]] ensemble of buildings from the sixteenth century, including the old city hall in the marketplace. There are also several [[Baroque architecture|baroque period]] trading houses and former residences of rich merchants. As Leipzig grew considerably during the economic boom of the late-nineteenth century, the town has many buildings in the [[Historicism (art)|historicist style]] representative of the {{Lang|de|[[Gründerzeit]]}} era. Approximately 35% of Leipzig's flats are in buildings of this type. The [[New Town Hall (Leipzig)|new city hall]], completed in 1905, is built in the same style.

Some 90,000 apartments in Leipzig were built in {{Lang|de|[[Plattenbau]]}} buildings during Communist rule in East Germany.<ref>* {{cite book | last=Tesch | first=Joachim | title=Bauen in Leipzig | publication-place=Leipzig | date=2003 | isbn=3-89819-159-1 | language=de}}</ref> and although some of these have been demolished and the numbers living in this type of accommodation have declined in recent years, a significant minority of people are still living in Plattenbau accommodation; Grünau, for example, had about 43,600 people living in this sort of accommodation in 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leipzig.de/gruenau/ |title=Leipzig-Grünau |work=city of Leipzig |language=de |access-date=27 May 2013 |archive-date=19 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419012621/http://www.leipzig.de/gruenau/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Paulinerkirche, Leipzig|St. Paul's Church]] was destroyed by the Communist government in 1968 to make room for a new main building for the university. After some debate, the city decided to establish a new, mainly secular building at the same location, called [[Paulinum (University of Leipzig)|Paulinum]], which was completed in 2012. Its architecture alludes to the look of the former church and it includes space for religious use by the faculty of theology, including the original altar from the old church and two newly built organs.

Many commercial buildings were built in the 1990s as a result of tax breaks after German reunification.

===Tallest buildings and structures===

The composer [[Richard Wagner]] was born in Leipzig in 1813, in the [[Brühl (Leipzig)|Brühl]]. [[Robert Schumann]] was also active in Leipzig music, having been invited by [[Felix Mendelssohn]] when the latter established Germany's first musical [[conservatoire]] in the city in 1843. [[Gustav Mahler]] was second conductor (working under [[Artur Nikisch]]) at the [[Oper Leipzig|Leipzig Opera]] from June 1886 until May 1888, and achieved his first significant recognition while there by completing and publishing [[Carl Maria von Weber]]'s opera [[Die Drei Pintos]]. Mahler also completed his own [[Symphony No. 1 (Mahler)|1st Symphony]] while living in Leipzig.

==Transport==

Founded at the crossing of [[Via Regia]] and [[Via Imperii]], Leipzig has been a major interchange of inter-European traffic and commerce since medieval times. After the [[Reunification of Germany]], immense efforts to restore and expand the traffic network have been undertaken and left the city area with an excellent infrastructure.

===Railways===

[[File:Bahnhof Leipzig von Panorama Tower 2013.jpg|thumb|right|Leipzig Hauptbahnhof is the main hub of the tram and railway network and the world's largest railway station by floor area.]]
[[File:Leipziger Bahnhof (228148125).jpeg|thumb|right|Inside Leipzig Hauptbahnhof]]
Opened in 1915, [[Leipzig Hauptbahnhof]] (lit. ''main station'') is the largest overhead railway station in Europe in terms of its built-up area. At the same time, it is an important supra-regional junction in the [[Intercity-Express]] (ICE) and [[Intercity (Deutsche Bahn)|Intercity]] network of the {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Bahn]]|italic=no}} as well as a connection point for [[S-Bahn]] and regional traffic in the Halle/Leipzig area.

In Leipzig the Intercity Express routes (Hamburg–)Berlin–Leipzig–Nuremberg–Munich and Dresden–Leipzig–Erfurt–Frankfurt am Main–(Wiesbaden/Saarbrücken) intersect. Leipzig is also the starting point for the intercity lines Leipzig-Halle (Saale)–Magdeburg–Hannover–Dortmund–Köln and –Bremen–Oldenburg(–Norddeich Mole). Both lines complement each other at hourly intervals and also stop at Leipzig/Halle Airport. The only international connection is the daily EuroCity Leipzig-Prague.

Most major and medium-sized towns in Saxony and southern Saxony-Anhalt can be reached without changing trains. There are also direct connections via regional express lines to Falkenberg/Elster-Cottbus, Hoyerswerda and Dessau-Magdeburg as well as Chemnitz. Neighbouring Halle (Saale) can be reached via three S-Bahn lines, two of which run via Leipzig/Halle Airport. The surrounding area of Leipzig is served by numerous regional and S-Bahn lines.

The city's railway connections are currently being greatly improved by major construction projects, particularly within the framework of the German Unity transport projects. The line to Berlin has been extended and has been passable at {{Convert|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} since 2006. On 13 December 2015, the high-speed line from Leipzig to Erfurt, designed for {{Convert|300|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, was put into operation. Its continuation to Nuremberg followed in December 2017. This integration into the high-speed network considerably reduced the journey times of the ICE from Leipzig to Nuremberg, Munich and Frankfurt am Main. The Leipzig-Dresden railway line, which was the first German long-distance railway to go into operation in 1839, is also undergoing expansion for 200&nbsp;km/h. The most important construction project in regional transport was the four-kilometer-long [[City-Tunnel (Leipzig)|city tunnel]], which went into operation in December 2013 as the main line of the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]].

There are freight stations in the districts of Wahren and Engelsdorf. In addition, a freight traffic centre has been set up near the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction for goods handling between road and rail, as well as a freight station on the site of the DHL hub at Leipzig/Halle Airport.

[[File:S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland. Talent 2,008,Station Leipzig Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz.jpg|thumb|right|A new train of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland at [[Leipzig Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz station]], August 2016]]
Leipzig is the core of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland line network. Together with the tram, six of the ten lines form the backbone of local public transport and an important link to the region and the neighbouring Halle. The main line of the S-Bahn consists of the underground S-Bahn stations Hauptbahnhof, Markt, Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz and [[Bayerischer Bahnhof]] leading through the City Tunnel as well as the above-ground station Leipzig MDR. There are a total of 30 S-Bahn stations in the Leipzig city area. Endpoints of the S-Bahn lines include Wurzen, Zwickau, Dessau, and Lutherstadt Wittenberg. Two lines run to Halle, one of them via Leipzig/Halle Airport.

With the timetable change in December 2004, the networks of Leipzig and Halle were combined to form the Leipzig-Halle S-Bahn. However, this network only served as a transitional solution and was replaced by the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland on 15 December 2013. At the same time, the main line tunnel, marketed as the Leipzig City Tunnel, went into operation. The tunnel, which is almost four kilometres long, crosses the entire city centre from the main railway station to the Bavarian railway station. The S-Bahn stations are up to 22 metres underground. This construction was the first to create a continuous north–south axis, which had not existed until now due to the north-facing terminus station. The connection to the south of the city and the federal state will thus be greatly improved.

===Tramway and buses===

{{see also|Trams in Leipzig}}
[[File:J39 342 Listplatz, ET 1002.jpg|thumb|right|Tram at Friedrich-List-Platz]]
The [[Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe]], existing since 1 January 1917, operate a total of 15 tram lines and 47 bus lines in the city.

The total length of the tram network is {{cvt|146|km}}, making it the largest in Saxony ahead of [[Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe|Dresden]] ({{cvt|134.4|km}}) and the second largest in Germany after [[Trams in Berlin|Berlin]] ({{cvt|196|km}}).

The longest line in the Leipzig network is line 11, which connects Schkeuditz with Markkleeberg over 22 kilometres and is the only tram line in Leipzig to run in three tariff zones of the Central German Transport Association.

Night bus lines N1 to N9 and the night tram N17 operate in the night traffic. On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays the tram line N10 and the bus line N60 also operate. The central transfer point between the bus and tram lines as well as to the S-Bahn is Leipzig Central Station.

===Bicycle===

Like most German cities, Leipzig has a traffic layout designed to be [[bicycle-friendly]]. There is an extensive cycle network. In most of the one-way central streets, cyclists are explicitly allowed to cycle both ways. A few cycle paths have been built or declared since 1990. According to the data from the 2021/22 [[traffic count]], [[the Saxons' Bridge]] has the highest traffic occupancy with over 15,000 cyclists per day in cycling in Leipzig.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Am Willy-Brandt-Platz und auf der Sachsenbrücke ist am meisten los |journal=[[Leipziger Volkszeitung]] |last=Puppe |first=Matthias |language=de |issue=257 |volume=130 |pages=18 |date=2023-11-04 |url=https://www.lvz.de/lokales/leipzig/strassenverkehr-in-leipzig-in-diesen-strassen-gibt-es-die-meisten-pkw-lkw-und-fahrraeder-ABPZZKUEXBG3PFSURQFQR7PJ5U.html |access-date=6 November 2023 |archive-date=5 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231105153731/https://www.lvz.de/lokales/leipzig/strassenverkehr-in-leipzig-in-diesen-strassen-gibt-es-die-meisten-pkw-lkw-und-fahrraeder-ABPZZKUEXBG3PFSURQFQR7PJ5U.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Since 2004 there is a [[bicycle-sharing system]]. Bikes can be borrowed and returned via smartphone app or by telephone. Since 2018, the system has enabled flexible borrowing and returning of bicycles in the inner city; in this zone, bicycles can be handed in and borrowed from almost any street corner. Outside these zones, there are stations where the bikes are waiting. The current locations of the bikes can be seen via the app. There are cooperation offers with the Leipzig public transport companies and car sharing in order to offer as complete a mobility chain as possible.

===Road===

[[File:Karte Mitteldeutsche Schleife.png|thumb|Leipzig's road network]]

Several federal motorways pass by Leipzig: the [[Bundesautobahn 14|A 14]] in the north, the [[Bundesautobahn 9|A 9]] in the west, and the [[Bundesautobahn 38|A 38]] in the south. The three motorways form a triangular partial ring of the double ring Mitteldeutsche Schleife around Halle and Leipzig. To the south towards Chemnitz, the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A 72]] is also partly under construction.

The [[Bundesstraße|federal roads]] [[Bundesstraße 2|B 2]], [[Bundesstraße 6|B 6]], [[Bundesstraße 87|B 87]], [[Bundesstraße 181|B 181]], and [[Bundesstraße 184|B 184]] lead through the city area.

The ring road (Innenstadtring), which corresponds to the course of the old city fortification, surrounds the city centre of Leipzig, which today is largely traffic-calmed.

Leipzig has a dense network of [[carsharing]] stations. Additionally, since 2018 there is also a stationless car sharing system in Leipzig. Here the cars can be parked and booked anywhere in the inner city without having to define a specific car or period in advance. Finding and booking is done via a smartphone app.

Leipzig is one of the few cities in Germany with [[vehicle for hire]] services that can be booked via a [[mobile app]]. In contrast to taxicab services, the start and destination must be defined beforehand and other passengers can be taken along at the same time if they share a route.

===Long-distance buses===

Since March 2018 there has been a central bus station directly east of Leipzig Central Station.

In addition to a large number of national lines, several international lines also serve Leipzig. The cities of Bregenz, Budapest, Milan, Prague, Sofia and Zurich, among others, can be reached without having to change trains. Around 30,000 journeys and 1.5&nbsp;million passengers a year are expected at the new bus station.

Some lines also use Leipzig/Halle Airport, located at the A 9/A 14 motorway junction, and [[Leipziger Messe]] for a stop. Passengers can take the S-Bahn from there to the city centre.

===Air===
[[File:Leipzig-Halle Airport Check-in.jpg|thumb|Leipzig/Halle Airport, hub of DHL]]

[[Leipzig/Halle Airport]] is the international commercial airport of the region. It is located at the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction northwest of Leipzig, halfway between the two major cities. The easternmost section of the new Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle line under construction gave the airport a long-distance railway station, which was also integrated into the ICE network when the railway line was completed in 2015.

Passenger flights are operated to and from the major German hub airports, European metropolises and holiday destinations, especially to the Mediterranean region and North Africa. The airport is of international importance in the cargo sector. In Germany, it ranks second behind Frankfurt am Main, fifth in Europe and 26th worldwide (as of 2011). [[DHL]] uses the airport as its central European hub. It is also the home base of the freight airlines [[Aerologic]] and [[European Air Transport Leipzig]].

The former military airport near [[Altenburg]], Thuringia, called [[Leipzig–Altenburg Airport|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], about a half-hour drive from Leipzig, was served by [[Ryanair]] until 2010.

===Water===

[[File:Leipzig - Elsterflutbett + Palmengartenwehr 01 ies.jpg|thumb|Boats at the [[White Elster|Elsterflutbett]]]]
In the first half of the 20th century, the construction of the [[Elster-Saale canal]], [[White Elster]], and [[Saale]] was started in Leipzig in order to connect to the network of waterways. The outbreak of the Second World War stopped most of the work, though some may have continued through the use of [[forced labor]]. The [[Lindenauer port]] was almost completed but not yet connected to the Elster-Saale and [[Karl Heine Canal]] respectively. The Leipzig rivers (White Elster, [[Neue Luppe|New Luppe]], [[Pleiße]], and [[Parthe]]) in the city have largely artificial river beds and are supplemented by some channels. These waterways are suitable only for small leisure boat traffic.

Through the renovation and reconstruction of existing [[mill race]]s and watercourses in the south of the city and flooded disused [[open cast mines]], the city's navigable water network is being expanded. A link between Karl Heine Canal and the disused Lindenauer port was opened in 2015. Still more work was scheduled to complete the Elster-Saale canal. Such a move would allow small boats to reach the [[Elbe]] from Leipzig. The intended completion date has been postponed because of an unacceptable cost-benefit ratio.
