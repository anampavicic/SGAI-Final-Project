'''Cao Lãnh''' ({{IPA|vi|kaːw˧ lajŋ̟˧˨˧|lang|Cao Lanh.ogg}}; [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] for "high leader") is the capital city of [[Đồng Tháp Province]], [[Vietnam]]. It is located at around {{coord|10|28|2|N|105|37|49|E |region:VN_type:city}}.<ref>Philip Taylor - ''Modernity and Re-Enchantment: Religion in Post-Revolutionary Vietnam'' 2007 Page 180 "The following year, under Master Minh Trí's leadership, she and a group of about one hundred families moved to Mỹ Phước, an area in Cao Lãnh district of the Đồng Tháp province, where new canals had not long been dug."</ref>

==History==
During the French colonial period Cao Lãnh found some supporters for the nationalist appeal of [[Trần Huy Liệu]]'s ''[[Đông Pháp Thời Báo]]'' (''Indochina Times'') founded in May 1923.<ref>Philippe M. F. Peycam  ''The Birth of Vietnamese Political Journalism: Saigon, 1916-1930'' 2012 Page 146 "A correspondent named Nguyễn Hỏang from the southern city of Cao Lãnh had taken up the political appeal initiated by Liệu. The time had passed for “arrangements.” The Vietnamese wished to enjoy the same rights as other free people, ..."</ref> Later, in the initial resistance to the French in 1945, the [[Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng]] and others in the South merged to form the Third Division of the popular army. Cao Lãnh was where the troops were reorganized into 23 units each of 500-600 men.<ref>Van Dao Hoang ''Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang: A Contemporary History'' 2008 Page 262 "The Third Division's forces increased to 15000 men when it arrived at Cao Lãnh. They were then reorganized into 23 troops (Bộ Đội), each with 500-600 men."</ref>

Prior to 1975, Cao Lãnh was the capital of Kiến Phong province, in the [[Mekong Delta]] region of [[South Vietnam]]. In February 1976, Kiến Phong was merged with [[Sa Đéc Province]] to become Đồng Tháp Province. [[Sa Đéc]] became the capital city of the new province. Cao Lãnh replaced Sa Đéc as the capital on April&nbsp;24, 1994, and became a city in October 2007.
