'''Jetpur''' is a city and a [[municipality]] in [[Rajkot district]] in the western [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Gujarat]].

==History==
[[File:Jetpur State Ruling Talukdars Family Tree 1884.png|thumb|Family Tree of ruling Talukdars of Jetpur State (1884) during British India]]
During the British period, the talukdars of Jetpur were Kathis of the Vala tribe. The taluka was a large and wealthy one consisting of 143 villages, and if under one chief would be a second class or even a first class state, as the revenue is not less than eight lakhs of rupees (Rs. 8,00,000).<ref name="GBP1884"/>

The Vala Kathis entered the province several centuries back, and one of their earliest seats was at [[Devalia Mota]] whence they conquered [[Chital]]. From Chital, they acquired Jetpur and subsequently [[Mendarda]] and [[Bilkha]]. There are two different accounts given of the acquisition of Jetpur, viz. (1) that of the ''Tarikh-i-Sorath'', which says that the first Nawab of [[Junagadh]], Bahadur Khan I, granted Jetpur to Vala Vim; (2) tradition, which says that Vala Viro Najo of Chital aided the Valas of [[Bagasra]] in their feud with Vaijo Khasia of Mitiala, and that Vala Samat of Bagasra was slain in the battle. In consideration of Vira's aid the Valas of Bagasra gave him Jetpur. These Bagasra Valas acquired their share in Jetpur from the Khadia Baloch who received it from the local Muslim governors of former times.<ref name="GBP1884"/>

Jetpur is said originally to have been a holding of the former Valas, and to have been conquered from Vala Champraj by Shamskhan at the same time as the Vala town of Kileshvar in the Bardas was sacked. It is said that Vala Champraj had a beautiful daughter whom he refused to give to Shamskhan in marriage on which that noble sacked Kileshvar and took Jetpur, Vala Champraj and eighteen hundred Kathi horse being left dead on the field. But Vala Champraj is said to have killed his daughter, hence Shamskhan failed to obtain her. The great-grandfather of this Vala Champraj was Jetji who founded and named Jetpur (as said in the ''Tarikh-i-Sorath''). Jetpur was held by sixteen talukdars descended from the common ancestor Vala Naja Desa in 1880s.<ref name="GBP1884"/>

A bridge has been constructed across the Bhadar about a mile north of Jetpur on the Rajkot- Jundgadh highway.<ref name="GBP1884">{{cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c70MAAAAIAAJ|year=1884|publisher=Government Central Press|pages=457–458}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>
