The name '''Kokshetau''' ({{langx|kk|Kökşetau}}; {{IPA-kk|køkɕetɑw|pron}}) is of [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] origin literally meaning a ({{lit|smoky-blue mountain}}), ''kokshe'' / "{{linktext|көкше}}", meaning ({{lit|blueish}}) and ''tau'' / "{{linktext|тау}}", meaning ({{lit|mountain}}) — the name of always turning blue, as if in a deep haze of mountains, thus "Blueish Mountain/Smoky-Blue Mountain" in [[English language|English]].

===Early history===
Kokshetau past incorporates all the main stages and turning points of the [[history of Kazakhstan]]. For many centuries, nomadic [[Kazakh tribes]] lived on the territory of the former Kokshetau Region. The territory of Kokshetau was part of the [[Middle Horde]], the clans of the tribal union of the [[Argyn]]s that occupied vast regions of Northern and Central Kazakhstan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ishvetsov.ru/en/chislennost-naseleniya-kokshetau-kazahstan-gorod-kokshetau-naselenie/|title=The population of Kokshetau. Kazakhstan, the city of Kokshetau: population|access-date=21 December 2020}}</ref> In the 18th – 19th centuries, the headquarters of famous [[List of Kazakh khans|khans]], such as [[Abylai Khan]], [[Kasym Khan]], [[Kazakh Khanate#Kenesary Khan (1841–1847)|Kenesary Khan]], were located on the land of Kokshetau Region.

===Foundation of Kokshetau (1824–1917)===
As Russia's hand [[Russian conquest of Central Asia|stretched southwards]], Kokshetau was initially founded on 29 April 1824 as an [[Stanitsa|administrative outpost]] at the foot of the southern side of [[Mount Kokshe]] on the shores of [[Lake Ulken Shabakty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://astanatimes.com/2018/05/kokshetau-a-beautiful-blue-mountain/|title=Kokshetau: a beautiful 'Blue Mountain'|date=14 May 2018 |access-date=12 September 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://assembly.kz/en/news/day-of-unity-of-the-people-of-kazakhstan-was-celebrated-in-kokshetau/?sphrase_id=24040395|title=Day of unity of the people of Kazakhstan was celebrated in Kokshetau|date=1 May 2017 |access-date=28 May 2023}}</ref> The Middle Horde signed treaties of protection with Russia. The local population strongly opposed the fact that the new settlement was placed in the chosen place. In the summer of 1827, the district order was transferred to the new place where the city of Kokshetau is now located. The settlement began to be called Kokchetav. The construction of the settlement began at the foot of [[Bukpa Hill]], on the southern shores of [[Lake Kopa]], and a picket was set up to protect the district order.<ref name="History">[http://etomesto.com/map-kazakhstan_akmolinskaya-oblast_1868-sibir-kirgizy/?x=69.277380&y=53.291717 Map of Kazakhstan Akmolinskaya Oblast 1868 Sibir Kirgizy]</ref>

By the middle of 19th-century, the population of the settlement was significantly increasing due to the migration of the [[peasants]] from Russia ([[Volga region|Povolzhye]]) and Ukraine who were driven to migrate by starvation and poverty to farm the steppe. In 1868, when the [[Akmolinsk Oblast (Russian Empire)|Akmolinsk Oblast]] was formed, Kokshetau became a district city in this region, which further developed as a center of agricultural and animal husbandry and as a [[resort town]]. In 1876, the city lost its military significance. The line and fortress were abolished. In 1895, Kokshetau was granted [[city status]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kazakhstan-tourist.isd.kz/page.php?page_id=526&lang=2|title=History of the town|access-date=21 December 2020}}</ref> By that time the population in the town was above 5 thousand people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://astanatimes.com/2017/02/kokshetau-the-area-of-blue-lakes/|title=Kokshetau: the area of blue lakes|date=23 February 2017 |access-date=21 December 2020}}</ref>

=== Soviet era (1918–1991) ===
In 1928, Kokshetau District was divided into several boroughs and until 1944 Kokshetau's territory was part of [[Karaganda Region]] and later part of [[North Kazakhstan Region]]. On 16 March 1944, according to the Decree of the [[Presidium of Supreme Soviet]] of [[Kazakh SSR]], Kokshetau became the administrative center of the newly created [[Kokchetav Oblast]]. Relatively rapid growth and development of Kokshetau took place during the years of development of [[Virgin Lands Campaign|virgin lands]], especially in the second half of the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://old.qazaqtv.com/en/programms/viewArchive?id=22888|title=Akmola region|access-date=21 December 2020}}</ref>

=== Fall of the Soviet Union and modern history (1991–present) ===
On 3 May 1997, [[Kokchetav Oblast|Kokshetau Oblast]] was abolished, the city was deprived of the status of a regional center.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://e-history.kz/en/news/show/7033|title=How did the 14 regions become?|access-date=26 May 2023}}</ref> On 8 April 1999, after Akmola and [[North Kazakhstan Region|North Kazakhstan]] regions were reorganized, Kokshetau became the center of [[Akmola Region]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wildticketasia.com/268-kokshetau-city-akmola-region-kazakhstan.html|title=Kokshetau city (Kokchetav) in Akmola Region, Kazakhstan.|access-date=21 December 2020}}</ref>

Kokshetau has traditionally been an important commercial center in northern Kazakhstan, but after the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] most of the old manufacturing lines, whose markets included the entire Soviet Union, either stopped working or had to greatly reduce their operations. The collapse of the Soviet Union also meant the collapse of Kazakhstan's industrial base.

Nevertheless, the city continues to be an important regional center for the [[Akmola Region]], acting as a commercial hub for the surrounding areas in the region. In recent years, the city has started attracting more investment from various corporations. [[Kokshetau Oblast]] had really started developing as the machine factories and other industries grew, and the numerous rest homes, sanatoria, and holiday spots were set up.

From [[Ekibastuz]] to Kokshetau runs an [[overhead power line]] designed for a transmission voltage of 1,150&nbsp;kV, the [[powerline Ekibastuz-Kokshetau|Ekibastuz-Kokshetau powerline]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kt.kz/eng/society/kazakhstan_restores_domestic_flights_with_seven_cities_1377898408.html|title=Kazakhstan restores domestic flights with seven cities|access-date=25 October 2022}}</ref> Kokshetau's retail business is growing with several newly built malls and shopping centres.

===Squares===
* The city centres on a large and bare [[Ablai Khan|Abylai Khan]] Square, at the intersection of [[Abai Qunanbaiuly]] and [[Kanysh Satbayev]] streets.
* Independence Square. It is the center of Kokshetau.

===Old Town===
West of the centre many attractive single-storey log-built houses survive, usually featuring painted wooden shutters. A couple of particularly fine examples, both enjoying official recognition as historical monuments, are the whitewashed wooden cottage at 22 Kenesary Khan Kasymuly Street, at the corner of [[Abai Qunanbaiuly]] Street, with intricate carving at the base of the roof, and the cottage at 33 [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]] Street. The latter sits opposite a small Kokshetau City History Museum (32 Kanay-bi Street), itself housed in a single-storey wooden building.

===Landmarks===
The city is full of numerous buildings and monuments that reflect its rich and diverse history. The architecture of Kokshetau has been shaped through its history by the progression of historical eras. Many buildings of Kokshetau are ranged from a different number of architectural styles.

==== Historical architecture ====
The architecture of the city dates back to 19th century, the city had numerous wooden buildings with elaborate decor. Kokshetau is the home of a unique architectural tradition and community with number of historical buildings in city. There are a number of two-story wooden houses in the city built mostly in the middle of the 20th century as temporary habitations. Among other notable buildings are the mansions of the merchant Andrei Vasilievich Sokolov (late of the 19th century - beginning of the 20th century), the [[Akmola Regional Museum of History and Local Lore]] (beginning of the 20th century).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://e-history.kz/en/news/show/8137|title=The old-timer building. The house of merchant Sokolov|access-date=23 May 2023}}</ref>

==== Soviet-era architecture ====
Industrialization in Kokshetau started in the late 1920s. The city's 3,000-worker Soviet construction trust built some of the large, gray, faceless apartment buildings that were so typical of Soviet society and still stand, often in disrepair, today. The apartments housed the trust's own construction workers, among others, in units of one to three rooms. The city's apartment houses are called “[[Khrushchyovka]]” and “[[Stalinist architecture|Stalinka]]” due to the peculiarities of architectural approaches in their construction.

==== Contemporary architecture ====
When the [[Iron Curtain]] was falling, but the Soviet Union still was intact, five citizens from the city paid a visit to [[Waukesha, Wisconsin|Waukesha]]. Among them was then mayor of the city, Askar Khassen, who took the idea of building more single homes in Kokshetau, as comfortable as the homes in the US. On the hilly outskirts of Kokshetau, someone may find the fingerprint of [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha County]]. There are big, expensive, single-family homes. They're inching up the hills. In Kokshetau, the locals have a name for this high-priced neighborhood of single-family homes, "Small America" or "Khassen's Cottages". Prominently located at the opening of this housing development are tall brick pillars, a sign outlining location of lots, and a decorative brick wall, all reminiscent of the gated entries seen in some Waukesha County subdivisions.

When the Soviet Union crumbled and Kazakhstan became an independent country in 1991, the city's construction trust-turned-business began to put a face on their buildings.
