== Etymology ==
The precise origin of the name is unknown, however there are numerous and speculative theories for the origin of the name ''Riga'':

* It is an adapted word, borrowing from the [[Livonian language|Livonian]] {{Lang|liv|ringa}} meaning loop, which refers to the ancient natural harbor formed by the tributary loop of the [[Daugava|Daugava River]].<ref name="CEROI">{{cite web|url=http://www.ceroi.net/reports/riga/latviski/pamatlietas/teritorija.htm|title=Teritorija un administratīvās robežas vēsturiskā skatījumā|publisher=Cities Environmental Reports on the Internet|language=lv|access-date=2 August 2007|archive-date=13 August 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813035658/http://ceroi.net/reports/riga/latviski/pamatlietas/teritorija.htm}}</ref><ref name="BCelts">{{cite web|url= http://www.liis.lv/latval/Valoda/Teksts/1nodalja/Citati/10.htm|title= Endzelīns, Did Celts Inhabit the Baltics (1911 Dzimtene's Vēstnesis (''Homeland Messenger'') No. 227)|publisher= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209024956/http://www.liis.lv/latval/Valoda/Teksts/1nodalja/Citati/10.htm |archive-date=9 December 2008|access-date= 24 July 2009}}</ref>
* It could be derived from Riege, the German name for the River Rīdzene, a former tributary of the Daugava.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.riga.lv/EN/Channels/About_Riga/History_of_Riga/Stories/Udeni/Ridzina.htm |title=Riga municipality portal |website=riga.lv |access-date=10 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223130131/http://www.riga.lv/EN/Channels/About_Riga/History_of_Riga/Stories/Udeni/Ridzina.htm |archive-date=23 February 2012}}</ref>
* [[Albert of Riga|Bishop Albert]] claimed credit from his campaign to conquer and convert the local populace, as coming from the Latin {{Lang|la|rigata}} ("irrigated"), symbolising an "irrigation of dry pagan souls by Christianity".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.riga.lv/EN/Channels/About_Riga/History_of_Riga/Stories/Udeni/Ridzina.htm |title=Coat of arms of Riga|website=riga.lv |access-date=26 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711114153/http://www.ngw.nl/int/lat/riga.htm|archive-date=11 July 2007}}</ref>

However, the most reliably documented explanation is the affirmation by German historian Dionysius Fabricius (1610) that Riga's name comes from its already established role in trade:<ref>Vauchez et al. ''Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages''. Routledge, 2001</ref> "Riga obtained its name from the buildings or warehouses found in great number along the banks of the Duna, which the Livs in their own language are accustomed to call Riae".<ref>Fabrius, D. Livonicae Historiae Compendiosa Series, 1610</ref>{{Efn|Latin original: "{{lang|la|Riga nomen sortita est suum ab aedificiis vel horreis quorum a litus Dunae magna fuit copia, quas livones sua lingua Rias vocare soliti|italic=no}}".}} The "j" in Latvian {{Lang|lv|rīja}} hardened to a "g" in German. English geographer [[Richard Hakluyt]] (1589) corroborates this account, calling Riga as ''Rie'', as pronounced in Old Latvian.<ref>Bilmanis, A. ''Latvia as an Independent State''. Latvian Legation. 1947.</ref> This is further supported by the fact that Riga is called ''Riia'' in Estonian (a language closely related to [[Livonian language|Livonian]]).

=== Founding ===
The river [[Daugava]] has been a [[trade route]] since antiquity, part of the [[Varangians|Vikings']] [[Route from the Varangians to the Greeks|Dvina–Dnieper navigation route]] to Byzantium.<ref name="BilmanisLIS">Bilmanis, A. Latvia as an Independent State. Latvian Legation. 1947.</ref> A sheltered [[natural harbour|natural harbor]] {{cvt|15|km}} upriver from the mouth of the Daugava—the site of today's Riga—has been recorded, as ''Duna Urbs'', as early as the 2nd century.<ref name="BilmanisLIS"/> It was settled by the [[Livonians|Livs]], a [[Baltic Finnic peoples|Finnic]] tribe.<!-- Requires new citation. -->
[[File:Plaza del Ayuntamiento, Riga, Letonia, 2012-08-07, DD 10.JPG|thumb|The [[House of the Blackheads (Riga)|building of the Brotherhood of Blackheads]] is one of the most iconic buildings of Old Riga ([[Vecrīga]]).]]
Riga began to develop as a centre of [[Viking Age|Viking trade during the early Middle Ages]].<ref name="BilmanisLIS"/>
Riga's inhabitants engaged mainly in fishing, [[animal husbandry]], and trading, later developing crafts, including bone, wood, amber, and iron.<ref name="BilmanisLIS"/>

The ''[[Livonian Chronicle of Henry]]'' testifies to Riga having long been a trading centre by the 12th century, referring to it as {{lang|la|portus antiquus}} (ancient port), and describes dwellings and warehouses used to store mostly flax, and hides.<ref name="BilmanisLIS"/> German traders began visiting Riga, establishing a nearby outpost in 1158.

Along with German traders the monk [[Saint Meinhard|Meinhard of Segeberg]]<ref name="EMA">Vauchez et al. Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages. Routledge, 2001</ref> arrived to convert the Livonian pagans to Christianity. [[Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] had already arrived in Latvia more than a century earlier, and many Latvians had been baptized.<ref name="BilmanisLIS"/><ref name="EMA"/> Meinhard settled among the Livs, building a castle and church at Uexküll (now known as [[Ikšķile]]), upstream from Riga, and established his bishopric there.<ref name="EMA"/> The Livs, however, continued to practice [[paganism]] and Meinhard died in Uexküll in 1196, having failed in his mission.<ref name="Saga">Germanis, U. The Latvian Saga. 10th ed. 1998. Memento, Stockholm.</ref> In 1198, the [[Berthold of Hanover|Bishop Berthold]] arrived with a contingent of [[crusaders]]<ref name="Saga"/> and commenced a campaign of forced [[Christianisation|Christianization]].<ref name="BilmanisLIS"/><ref name="EMA"/> Berthold died soon afterwards and his forces were defeated.<ref name="Saga"/>

The Church mobilized to avenge this defeat. [[Pope Innocent III]] issued a bull declaring a crusade against the [[Livonians]].<ref name="Saga"/> [[Albert of Riga|Bishop Albert]] was proclaimed [[Bishop of Livonia]] by his uncle [[Hartwig of Uthlede]], [[Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen|Prince-Archbishop of Bremen and Hamburg]] in 1199. Albert landed in Riga in 1200<ref name="BilmanisLIS"/><ref name="Saga"/> with 23 ships<ref name="CathE">Laffort, R.

=== Under Bishop Albert ===
The year 1201 also marked the first arrival of German merchants in Novgorod, via the Dvina.<ref name="PDIntBus">Dollinger, P.

Lorenzo Pigni. 1999.</ref> and trade, Albert established the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Order of Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] in 1202, which was open to nobles and merchants.<ref name=PDIntBus/>

The Christianisation of the Livs continued. In 1207, Albert started to fortify the town.<ref name=PDIntBus/><ref name="ORZarina">Zarina, D.

Albert had ensured Riga's commercial future by obtaining papal bulls which decreed that all German merchants had to carry on their Baltic trade through Riga.<ref name=ACQRxlvi/> In 1211, Riga minted its first coinage,<ref name=BilmanisLIS/> and Albert laid the cornerstone for the [[Riga Cathedral|Riga Dom]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.doms.lv/info/?mnu_id=50|title= Doma vēsture (history)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705161605/http://www.doms.lv/info/?mnu_id=50 |archive-date=5 July 2010|access-date= 29 July 2009}}</ref> Riga was not yet secure as an alliance of tribes failed to take Riga.<ref name=ACQRxlvi/> In 1212, Albert led a campaign to compel [[Polotsk]] to grant German merchants free river passage.<ref name=PDIntBus/> Polotsk conceded Kukenois ([[Koknese]]) and [[Principality of Jersika|Jersika]] to Albert, also ending the Livs' tribute to Polotsk.<ref name="MedChronV">Kooper, E.

Riga's merchant citizenry chafed and sought greater autonomy from the Church. In 1221, they acquired the right to independently self-administer Riga<ref name=RRiga/> and adopted a city constitution.<ref name="CTHW">Wright, C.T.H. ''The Edinburgh Review'', ''The Letts'', 1917</ref>

That same year Albert was compelled to recognise Danish rule over lands they had conquered in Estonia and Livonia.<ref name="CCBF">Murray, A., ''Crusade and Conversion on the Baltic Frontier, 1150–1500''.

=== Hanseatic League ===
In 1282, Riga became a member of the [[Hanseatic League]]. The Hansa was instrumental in giving Riga economic and political stability, thus providing the city with a strong foundation which endured the political conflagrations that were to come, down to modern times.

As the influence of the Hanseatic League waned, Riga became the object of foreign military, political, religious and economic aspirations. Riga accepted the [[Reformation]] in 1522, ending the power of the archbishops. In 1524, [[iconoclast]]s targeted a statue of the [[Virgin Mary]] in the cathedral to make a statement against religious icons. It was accused of being a witch, and given a [[Trial by ordeal|trial by water]] in the [[Daugava]] river. The statue floated, so it was denounced as a witch and burnt at Kubsberg.<ref name="fn_1">{{cite book|last=MacCulloch|first=Diarmaid|author-link=Diarmaid MacCulloch|title=The Reformation: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rE7uAAAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Penguin|page = 150|isbn=978-0-670-03296-9|access-date=10 February 2016}}</ref> With the demise of the [[Livonian Order]] (1561) during the [[Livonian War]], Riga for twenty years had the status of a [[free imperial city]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] before it came under the influence of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] by the [[Treaty of Drohiczyn]], which ended the war for Riga in 1581. In 1621, during the [[Polish–Swedish War (1621–1625)]], Riga and the outlying fortress of [[Daugavgrīva]] came under the rule of [[Gustavus Adolphus]], [[King of Sweden]], who intervened in the [[Thirty Years' War]] not only for political and economic gain but also in favour of German [[Lutheran]] [[Protestantism]]. During the [[Russo-Swedish War (1656–1658)]], Riga withstood a siege by Russian forces.

Riga remained one of the largest cities under the Swedish crown until 1710,<ref>The Dynamics of Economic Culture in the North Sea and Baltic Region. Uitgeverij Verloren, 2007. {{ISBN|9789065508829}}.

In July 1701, during the opening phase of the [[Great Northern War]], the ''[[Crossing of the Düna]]'' took place nearby, resulting in a victory for king [[Charles XII of Sweden]]. Between November 1709 and June 1710, however, the Russians under [[Tsar]] [[Peter the Great]] [[Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia|besieged and captured Riga]], which was at the time [[The plague during the Great Northern War#Lithuania, Livonia, Estonia|struck by a plague]]. Along with the other Livonian towns and gentry, [[Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia|Riga capitulated to Russia]], but largely retained their privileges. Riga was made the capital of the [[Governorate of Livonia|Governorate of Riga (later, Livonia)]]. [[Swedish Empire|Sweden's northern dominance]] had ended, and Russia's [[Russian Empire|emergence as the strongest Northern power]] was formalised through the [[Treaty of Nystad]] in 1721.

More and more Latvians started moving to the city during the mid-19th century. The rise of a Latvian [[bourgeoisie]] made Riga a centre of the [[Latvian National Awakening]] with the founding of the Riga Latvian Association in 1868 and the organisation of the first national song festival in 1873. The nationalist movement of the [[Young Latvians|Neo-Latvians]] was followed by the socialist [[New Current]] during the city's rapid industrialisation, culminating in the [[1905 Russian Revolution|1905 Revolution]] led by the [[Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party]].

The 20th century brought [[World War I]] and the impact of the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 to Riga. As a result of the [[battle of Jugla]], the [[Imperial German Army|German army]] marched into Riga on 3 September 1917.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greatwardifferent.com/Great_War/Russian_Battery/Retirement_01.htm |title=Russian Retreat 1917 |publisher=Greatwardifferent.com |access-date=16 September 2011 |archive-date=18 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618041140/http://www.greatwardifferent.com/Great_War/Russian_Battery/Retirement_01.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> On 3 March 1918, the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] was signed, giving the [[Baltic countries]] to Germany. Because of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice with Germany]] of 11 November 1918, Germany had to renounce that treaty, as did Russia, leaving Latvia and the other Baltic States in a position to claim independence. Latvia, with Riga as its capital city, thus declared its independence on 18 November 1918.
Between World War I and World War II (1918–1940), Riga and Latvia shifted their focus from Russia to the countries of Western Europe. The United Kingdom and Germany replaced Russia as Latvia's major trade partners. The majority of the Baltic Germans [[Nazi–Soviet population transfers|were resettled in late 1939]], prior to the occupation of Estonia and Latvia by the Soviet Union in June 1940.

During [[World War II]], Latvia was occupied by the [[Soviet Union]] in June 1940 and then was occupied by [[German occupation of Latvia during World War II|Nazi Germany in 1941–1944]]. On 17 June 1940, the Soviet forces invaded Latvia occupying bridges, post/telephone, telegraph, and broadcasting offices. Three days later, Latvian president [[Kārlis Ulmanis]] was forced to approve a pro-Soviet government which had taken office. On 14–15 July, rigged elections were held in Latvia and the other Baltic states, The ballots held the following instructions: "Only the list of the [[Latvian Working People's Bloc]] must be deposited in the ballot box. The ballot must be deposited without any changes." The alleged voter activity index was 97.6%. Most notably, the complete election results were published in Moscow 12 hours before the election closed. Soviet electoral documents found later substantiated that the results were completely fabricated. The Soviet authorities, having regained control over Riga and Latvia imposed a regime of terror, opening the headquarters of the [[KGB]], massive deportations started. Hundreds of men were arrested, including leaders of the former Latvian government. The most notorious deportation, the [[June deportation]] took place on 13 and 14 June 1941, estimated at 15,600 men, women, and children, and including 20% of Latvia's last legal government. Similar deportations were repeated after the end of World War II. The building of the KGB located at 61 [[Brīvības iela]], known as 'the corner house', is now a museum. Stalin's deportations also included thousands of Latvian Jews. The mass deportation totalled 131,500 across the Baltics.

During the Nazi occupation, the [[History of the Jews in Latvia|Jewish community]] was forced into the [[Riga Ghetto]] and a [[Nazi concentration camp]] was constructed in [[Kaiserwald concentration camp|Kaiserwald]]. On 25 October 1941, the Nazis relocated all Jews from Riga and the vicinity to the ghetto. Most of Latvia's Jews (about 24,000) were killed on 30 November and 8 December 1941 in the [[Rumbula massacre]].<ref>Ezergailis, ''The Holocaust in Latvia'', p. 348</ref> By the end of the war, the remaining [[Baltic Germans]] were [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–1950)#Soviet Union|expelled to Germany]].

The Soviet Red Army reconquered Riga on 13 October 1944. In the following years the massive influx of labourers, administrators, military personnel, and their dependents from Russia and other Soviet republics started. [[Microdistrict]]s of the large multi-storied housing blocks were built to house immigrant workers.

By the end of World War II, [[Vecrīga|Riga's historical centre]] was heavily damaged from constant bombing. After the war, huge efforts were made to reconstruct and renovate most of the famous buildings that had been part of the skyline of the city before the war. Such buildings were, amongst others, [[St. Peter's Church, Riga|St. Peter's Church]] which lost its wooden tower after a fire caused by the [[Wehrmacht]] (renovated in 1954). Another example is the [[House of the Blackheads (Riga)|House of the Blackheads]], completely destroyed, its ruins subsequently demolished; a [[facsimile]] was constructed in 1995.

In 1989, the percentage of Latvians in Riga had fallen to 36.5%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csb.gov.lv/en/statistikas-temas/population-database-30625.html|title=Population – Database|work=csb.gov.lv|access-date=10 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221072849/http://www.csb.gov.lv/en/statistikas-temas/population-database-30625.html|archive-date=21 February 2012}}</ref>

== Government ==
{{Main|Riga City Council}}
[[File:Riga - City Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Riga City Council]]]]

The head of the city government in Riga is the mayor, or officially the Chairman of the Riga City Council. The mayor is elected by the city council. He or she is assisted by one or more Vice Mayors (deputy mayors). The current mayor is [[Vilnis Ķirsis]], who was elected on 17 August 2023 from [[New Unity]], with support from "Coalition for Cooperation", consisting of [[New Unity]], [[National Alliance (Latvia)|National Alliance/Latvian Regional Alliance (NA/LRA)]], Code for Riga, [[Honor to serve Riga|Honor to server Riga]] and [[For Latvia's Development]] factions.

The city council is a democratically elected institution and is the final decision-making authority in the city. The Council consists of 60 members or deputies who are elected every four years. The Presidium of the Riga City Council consists of the Chairman of the Riga City Council and the representatives delegated by the political parties or party blocks elected to the City Council. From February to October 2020, the offices of the Mayor and Vice Mayors were suspended and the council itself had been dissolved and replaced by an interim administration of representatives from three [[Government of Latvia|governmental]] ministries until snap [[2020 Riga City Council election|elections]] were held in 2020.

Notable causes include emigration and [[Ageing of Europe|low birth rates]]. According to the 2022 data, ethnic Latvians made up 47.4% of the population of Riga. [[Russians in Latvia|Russians]] formed 35.7%, [[Belarusians]] 3.6%, [[Ukrainians]] 3.5%, [[Polish people|Poles]] 1.7%, other ethnicities consisted 8.2%. By comparison, 63.0% of Latvia's total population was ethnically Latvian, 24.2% Russian, 3.1% Belarusian, 2.2% Ukrainian, 1.9% Polish, 1.1% are Lithuanian and the rest of other origins.

Upon the [[History of Latvia#Restoration of independence|restoration of Latvia's independence in 1991]], [[Soviet-era]] immigrants (and any of their offspring born before 1991) were not automatically granted Latvian citizenship because they had migrated to the territory of Latvia during the years of [[Soviet occupation of Baltic states|Soviet occupation]]. The proportion of ethnic Latvians in Riga increased from 36.5% in 1989 to 47.4% in 2022. In contrast, the percentage of Russians fell from 47.3% to 35.7% in the same time period. In 2022 citizens of Latvia made up 79.0%, [[non-citizens (Latvia)|non-citizens]] 15.3% and citizens of other countries 5.6% of the population of Riga.

== Economy ==
Riga is one of the key economic and financial centres of the [[Baltic states]]. Roughly half of all the jobs in Latvia are in Riga and the city generates more than 50% of Latvia's GDP as well as around half of Latvia's exports. The biggest exporters are in wood products, IT, food and beverage manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, transport and metallurgy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bizness.lv/prognozes-rezultati/id/10476/nosaukti-desmit-lielakie-eksportejosie-uznemumi-riga-un-rigas-regiona |title=/ Uzņēmējdarbība / Nosaukti desmit lielākie eksportējošie uzņēmumi Rīgā un Rīgas reģionā |publisher=Bizness.lv |access-date=12 March 2013 |archive-date=29 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629235358/http://www.bizness.lv/prognozes-rezultati/id/10476/nosaukti-desmit-lielakie-eksportejosie-uznemumi-riga-un-rigas-regiona |url-status=live }}</ref> Riga Port is one of the largest in the Baltics.

The former international airport of Riga, [[Spilve Airport]], located {{cvt|5|km|0}} from Riga city centre, is used for small aircraft, pilot training and recreational aviation. Riga was also home to a military air base during the [[Cold War]]—[[Rumbula Air Base]].

Public transport in the city is provided by [[Rīgas Satiksme]] which operates a large number of trams, buses and [[trolleybus]]es on an extensive network of routes across the city. In addition, up until 2012 many private owners operated [[minibus]] services, after which the City Council established the unified transport company ''Rīgas mikroautobusu satiksme'', establishing a monopoly over the service.

[[Riga International Coach Terminal]] provides domestic and international connections by [[Coach (bus)|coach]].

As the population of Riga city started to approach 1&nbsp;million people in the 1980s, the city became eligible (under the Soviet standards of the time) for the construction of a subway system [[Riga Metro]], which would have been paid for by the Soviet government. However, the population decline and shortage of funding following Latvian independence put an end to this plan.

Riga is connected to the rest of Latvia by [[Latvian Railways#Domestic routes|domestic trains]] operated by the national carrier [[Pasažieru vilciens|Passenger Train]], whose headquarters are in Riga. The main railway station is the [[Riga Central Station]]. It has stops for public transport along the streets Satekles iela, 13. janvāra iela Marijas iela, and Merķeļa iela.
