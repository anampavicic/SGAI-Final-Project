'''Pemba''' {{IPA|pt|ˈpẽbɐ|}} is a [[port]] city and district in [[Mozambique]]. It is the capital and largest city of the [[Cabo Delgado Province|Cabo Delgado]] province and lies on a [[peninsula]] in [[Pemba Bay]], the third largest in [[Africa]]. It is located northeast of [[Maputo]], Mozambique's capital.

Pemba is known as a prime destination for [[water sport]] and [[Underwater diving|diving]] enthusiasts due to the bay and coral reef that surrounds the city. [[Whale|Whales]], [[Ocean sunfish|sunfish]], [[Sea turtle|sea turtles]], and other various oceanic wildlife are known to frequent Pemba's coast.

== History ==
There is no record of the town's existence or settlement before the 20th century, mainly serving as fishing ground for visiting [[Malagasy peoples|Malagasy]] and [[Swahili people|Swahili]] fishermen. The first attempt at settlement was made by the Portuguese with a temporary fort that was dismantled after a few years in the late 1800s.

The town was founded by the land-controlling and recently formed [[Niassa Company]] in 1898 as a small trading port. It was shortly renamed as '''Porto Amélia''', after the last Queen of Portugal, [[Amélie of Orléans]].

After the end of the Niassa Company in 1929, Pemba was transferred to direct Portuguese control and became the capital of the newly created district of Cabo Delgado. It took the place of the nearby village of [[Ibo (Mozambique)|Ibo]], in part due to Pemba's access to large ships. It was renamed Pemba at the end of Portuguese rule, in 1975. 

The city's inhabitants are primarily [[Swahili people|Swahili]], [[Makonde people|Makondes]], [[Macuas]] and [[Mwani language|Mwanis]].  Local languages that are spoken are [[Kimwani]] and [[Makhuwa language|Makhuwa]], although [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is widespread.

Pemba is taking refugees in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Palma]], but has not yet been directly involved in the ongoing [[Insurgency in Cabo Delgado]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-03-29|title=Isis claims deadly attack in northern Mozambique|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/29/isis-claims-deadly-attack-in-northern-mozambique|access-date=2021-03-30|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref>
