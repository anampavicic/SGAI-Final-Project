'''Tétouan''' ({{langx|ar|تطوان|tiṭwān}}, {{IPA|ar|titwaːn|}}) is a city in northern [[Morocco]]. It lies along the [[Martil Valley]] and is one of the two major ports of Morocco on the [[Mediterranean Sea]], a few miles south of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], and about {{convert|60|km|mi}} E.S.E. of [[Tangier]]. In the [[2014 Moroccan census]], the city recorded a population of 380,787 inhabitants.<ref name=census2014/> It is part of the administrative division [[Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima]].

The city has witnessed many development cycles spanning over more than 2,000 years. The first settlements, discovered a few miles outside of the modern city limits, belonged to the ancient [[Mauretania|Mauretanians]] and date back to the 3rd century BC. A century later, [[Phoenicians]] traded there and after them the site—known now as the ancient town of [[Tamuda]]—became a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] colony under Emperor [[Augustus]].<ref name="M. Tarradell, 1957, p. 272">M. Tarradell, ''El poblamiento antiguo del Rio Martin'', Tamuda, IV, 1957, p. 272</ref><ref name="Azifi 1990">M. R.

In the late 13th century, the [[Marinid dynasty|Marinids]] started by building a [[Kasbah|casbah]] and mosque in what is now the old city. Soon after in 1305, the scale of the settlement was expanded by sultan [[Abu Thabit Amir]], who fortified the place.<ref name="Zar' 1326">Ali ibn-abi-Zar' (1326) - Rawd Al-Kirtas (Histoire des souverains du Maghreb et annales de la ville de Fès. Traduction française Auguste Beaumier. Editions La Porte, Rabat, 1999, p. 325)</ref> Around the early 15th century, the [[Crown of Castile|Castilians]] destroyed the settlement in retaliation for piracy.

The modern history of the city starts around the late 15th century. It was re-built and fortified by [[Ali al-Mandri]], who emigrated from the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]] city of [[Granada]] in the decade before it fell in the hands of the [[Catholic Monarchs]] [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]] as the [[War of Granada]] was completed in 1492.

In 1913, Tétouan became the capital of the [[Spanish protectorate of Morocco]], which was governed by the [[Khalifa (Morocco)|Khalifa]] (Moroccan prince serving as [[Viceroy]] for the [[Sultan]]), and the Spanish "[[High Commissioner|Alto Comisario]]" accredited to him. It remained the capital until 1956, when Morocco regained its full independence.

== Etymology ==
According to [[Leo Africanus]], the name comes after the [[Goths]] bestowed the government of the town upon a woman with one eye and that the inhabitants called it ''Tetteguin'', meaning "eye" in their language.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The history and description of Africa and of the notable things therein contained|pages=511|last=Leo|first=Africanus|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Brown, Robert, 1842-1895.|isbn=9781108012881|location=Cambridge|oclc=717137503}}</ref> 

The current name is first mentioned in 9th-century Arabic chronicles, after the death of [[Idris II]].<ref>''Tetouan'', Halima Ferhat, '''The Encyclopaedia of Islam''', Vol. X, 549.</ref>

'''{{Main|History of Tétouan}}'''

=== Phoenician and Roman presence ===
{{Main|Tamuda|Mauretania Tingitana}}
A few miles outside of the city limits lies the ancient town of [[Tamuda]]. Early settlements at the outskirts of the actual city by ancient [[Mauretania|Mauretanians]] date back to the 3rd century BC. Artifacts from both the [[Phoenicians|Phoenician]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] era have been found at the site of [[Tamuda]].<ref name="M. Tarradell, 1957, p. 272"/><ref name="Azifi 1990"/> It became a Roman colony under Emperor [[Augustus]].

=== Rebuilding the city-state ===

In 1286, the [[Marinid dynasty|Marinids]] built a casbah and mosque there. The first large-scale building project took place in 1305 when the settlement was expanded by the [[Marinid]] sultan [[Abu Thabit Amir]].<ref name="Zar' 1326"/> He fortified the place and had it serve as a base for attacks on [[Ceuta]], which had recently come under the rule of a rebellious member of the Marinid dynasty. In 1399, [[Sack of Tétouan (1399)|it was destroyed]] by the [[Crown of Castile|Castilians]], because pirates used it for their attacks. The Portuguese were already occupying the neighboring [[Ceuta]] and in 1436, its commander [[Pedro de Menezes, 1st Count of Vila Real]] dispatched a detachment of his garrison under his son [[Duarte de Menezes, 3rd Count of Viana|Duarte de Menezes]] to raid Tétouan - which was recovering from the Castillian destruction - in order to prevent it from becoming a threat to future Portuguese operations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Histoire de l'Afrique du Nord: Tunisie, Algérie, Maroc.|author=Julien, Charles André|pages=195|date=1972|publisher=Payot|oclc=848005}}</ref>

By the end of the 15th century, it was rebuilt by refugees from the [[Reconquista]] (reconquest of Spain, completed by the fall of [[Granada]] in 1492), when the [[Moors#Moors of Iberia|Andalusian Moors]], led by [[Ali al-Mandri]], a captain of the troops loyal to [[Muhammad XII of Granada|Boabdil]], the last king of the [[Emirate of Granada|Nasrid Kingdom of Granada]], took refuge in the ruined city. They first raised the walls and then filled the enclosure with houses. These Andalusians came into conflict with the Beni Hozmar tribe settling in [[Jebala people|Jebala]] lands, after which they asked the [[Wattasid]] sultan for protection. In response, he sent 80 soldiers (according to one chronicle, 40 natives of Fez and 40 Riffians). In turn, the Andalusians paid a large amount of [[mithqal]], thus insuring their autonomy. Instantly, the Andalusians, assisted by tribes from the surrounding mountains, started harassing the Spanish possessions on the Moroccan coast. These attacks led to the destruction of the city's harbor by the Spanish in 1565. During this time, the city was governed by the Andalusian Abu Hassan al-Mandri and the city remained autonomous from the Saadi sultans, with the Saadis constantly trying to assert their power.

=== Piracy and ''Mazmorras'' ===
[[File:Naval flag of Tetuan - Bowles%27s chart of 1783.png|thumb|right|Naval flag of Tétouan (1783)|200x200px]]
As early as the 1530s and 1540s, at the time when Spain and the [[Ottoman Empire]] were disputing control over the western part of the Mediterranean, piracy was spreading and soon Tétouan became one of the main centers of piracy in the region.<ref>{{Cite thesis|first=Adriana|last=Valencia|title=Migration and the City: Urban Effects of the Morisco Expulsion|pages=49|date=2011|publisher=UC Berkeley|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2k14r6vm|language=en}}</ref> Corsairs considered it as a form of retaliation against the [[Reconquista|Spanish Reconquista]] that led to the loss of their homes back in [[al-Andalus]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mediterranean island hopping : the Spanish islands : a handbook for the independent traveller|first1=Dana|last1=Facaros|date=1981|publisher=Hippocrene Books|last2=Pauls|first2=Michael|pages=223|isbn=978-0882545882|location=New York, N.Y.|oclc=8035048}}</ref> especially that the timing coincided with the first [[Morisco]] influx to Tétouan due to the forced conversions they faced in Spain between 1501 and 1526.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Frontiers of heresy : the Spanish Inquisition from the Basque lands to Sicily|pages=126|last=Monter|first=William|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521522595|location=Cambridge|oclc=49594009}}</ref> Their collaborators included [[Anglo-Turkish piracy|English and Dutch renegades]]<ref>{{Cite thesis|title=Early modern Spain and the creation of the Mediterranean captivity, commerce, and knowledge|pages=11|type=Doctorant|last=Herhsenzon|first=Daniel Bernardo|oclc=949200820}}</ref> who were mostly [[Protestantism|Protestants]], although a few had converted to [[Islam]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Orientalism in early modern France : Eurasian trade, exoticism, and the Ancien Régime|first=Ina|last=Baghdiantz McCabe|pages=86–87|date=2008|publisher=Berg|isbn=9781847884633|location=Oxford|oclc=423067636}}</ref>

While the harbor served as a port from where piracy missions were launched, captives were taken to [[dungeon]]s. There were underground prison complexes with a series of connected excavated caves called ''Mazmorras''. The captives were faced with being sold to the [[Barbary slave trade|slavery market]] if ransoms were not paid.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cervantes' epic novel : empire, religion, and the dream life of heroes in Persiles|last=Armstrong-Roche|first=Michael|pages=52|date=2010|publisher=University of Toronto Press|others=Gibson Library Connections|isbn=9781442687578|location=Toronto [Ont.]|oclc=635459383}}</ref> These subterranean installations were rediscovered in the early 20th century.

[[Miguel de Cervantes|Miguel De Cervantes]], himself a captive in [[Algiers, Algeria]] between 1575 and 1580, refers to ''Mazmorras'' in ''[[:es:El juez de los divorcios|El juez de los divorcios]]'' (The Divorce Judge), where the protagonist compares his marriage to "captivity in Tetouan's caves."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.larazon.es/cultura/marruecos-una-inspiracion-para-cervantes-FI9486214|title=Marruecos, una inspiración para Cervantes|work=La Razón|access-date=2018-10-05|language=es-ES}}</ref> He also mentions it in ''[[Don Quixote]]'', in addition to talking about Tétouan in ''[[:es:El trato de Argel|El trato de Argel]]'', ''[[:es:La gran sultana|La gran sultana]]'' and ''[[La ilustre fregona]]''.

The underground prison was explored in 1922 by Cesar Luis de Montalban, based on a report by archaeologist [[Manuel Gómez-Moreno Martínez]].<ref>{{Cite interview |last=Benaboud |first=Mhamamd |interviewer=Julio Liberto Corrales |title=Las mazmorras de Tetuán |url=https://circulodiwan.wordpress.com/2015/06/26/las-mazmorras-de-tetuan/ |access-date=2018-10-05 |work=Circulo Diwan |date=2015-06-26 |trans-title=The Dungeons of Tetuan |language=es-ES}}</ref> The Spanish protectorate administration then commissioned architect Carlos Ovilo to study the site but they found out that no excavation could be possible without taking the risk of damaging the housing above the site.

=== Late military history ===
In the 17th century, the city was governed by the wealthy al-Naksis family. At the end of the century, the city was taken by the [[Alaouite]] sultan [[Moulay Ismail]], who encountered fierce resistance. Tétouan remained fragile, until it was taken by the Alaouite governor of Tangier and leader of a moroccan army that had occupied [[Tangier]] after the English had evacuated [[English Tangier|the possession]]. The Alaouite governor ushered in a period of stability in Tétouan, building many of the city's landmarks such as the Meshwar palace and the Pasha mosque, the oldest standing mosque in Tétouan. After his death, the city again rebelled and was only nominally controlled by the central government.

Tétouan received a number of Algerian immigrants following the [[Invasion of Algiers in 1830|French invasion of Algiers]] in 1830. According to Bouhlila, they introduced [[baklava]], [[coffee]], and the [[Filo|''warqa'']] pastry now used in [[pastilla]].<ref name="Anny Gaul">{{Cite web|last=Gaul|first=Anny|date=2019-11-27|title=Bastila and the Archives of Unwritten Things|url=https://themaydan.com/2019/11/bastila-and-the-archives-of-unwritten-things/|access-date=2019-12-13|website=Maydan|language=en-US|quote="I was especially interested in Tetouani baqlawa, a pastry typically associated with the eastern Mediterranean, not the west. The baqlawa we sampled was shaped in a spiral, unlike the diamond-shaped version I was more familiar with from Levantine food. But its texture and flavors––thin buttered layers of crisp papery pastry that crunch around sweet fillings with honeyed nuts––were unmistakable. Instead of the pistachios common in eastern baqlawa, El Mofaddal’s version was topped with toasted slivered almonds. Was baqlawa the vehicle that had introduced phyllo dough to Morocco?<br /><br />There is a strong argument for the Turkic origin of phyllo pastry, and the technique of shaping buttered layers of it around sweet and nut-based fillings was likely developed in the imperial kitchens of Istanbul.[4] So my next step was to find a likely trajectory that phyllo dough might have taken from Ottoman lands to the kitchens of northern Morocco.<br /><br />It so happened that one of Dr. Bejjit’s colleagues, historian Idriss Bouhlila, had recently published a book about the migration of Algerians to Tetouan in the nineteenth/thirteenth century. His work explains how waves of Algerians migrated to Tetouan fleeing the violence of the 1830 French invasion. It includes a chapter that traces the influences of Ottoman Algerians on the city’s cultural and social life. Turkish language and culture infused northern Morocco with new words, sartorial items, and consumption habits––including the custom of drinking coffee and a number of foods, especially sweets like baqlawa. While Bouhlila acknowledges that most Tetouanis consider bastila to be Andalusi, he suggests that the word itself is of Turkish origin and arrived with the Algerians."<br />...<br />"Bouhlila’s study corroborated the theory that the paper-thin ouarka used to make bastila, as well as the name of the dish itself, were introduced to Morocco by way of Tetouani cuisine sometime after 1830."}}</ref><ref name="Bouhlila-2012">{{cite book|author=Idriss Bouhlila|url=https://archive.org/details/Al-djazairiyun.Fi.Ttouan/page/n127/mode/2up|title=الجزائريون في تطوان خلال القرن 13هـ/19م|pages=128–129}}</ref> For Gil Marks, it was rather the Sephardic Jews who introduced the Ottoman warqa, which the Moroccans substituted for the Spanish pastry.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Marks |first=Gil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gFK_yx7Ps7cC |title=Encyclopedia of Jewish Food |date=2010-11-17 |publisher=HMH |isbn=978-0-544-18631-6 |language=en}}</ref>

{{Main|Hispano-Moroccan War (1859–60)|Battle of Tétouan|Spanish protectorate in Morocco}}
In 1844, Morocco lost a [[Franco-Moroccan War|war against the French]] and in 1856, it signed the ''Anglo-Moroccan treaties of Friendship'' with the British. The Spaniards saw the Moroccan defeat in 1844 and the treaties signed in 1865 as a sign of their weakness. Spurred by a national passion for African conquest, Spain declared war on Morocco in 1859 after a conflict over the borders of Ceuta.

After a few months, Tétouan was [[Spanish-Moroccan War (1859)|taken]] on 4 February 1860 under the command of [[Leopoldo O'Donnell, 1st Duke of Tetuan|General Leopoldo O'Donnell]], who was a descendant of an old Irish royal family, the [[O'Donnells of Tyrconnell]]. He was made hereditary [[Duke of Tetuán]], and later served as [[Prime Minister of Spain]]. However, two years later the Spanish evacuated in May 1862.

In 1913, it became the capital of the [[Spanish protectorate of Morocco]], which was governed by the [[Khalifa (Morocco)|Khalifa]] (Moroccan prince, serving as Viceroy for the Sultan), and the Spanish "[[High Commissioner|Alto Comisario]]" accredited to him, and it remained its capital until 1956.

=== The nationalist movement ===

=== Jewish presence ===
Tétouan has been home to a significant [[Sephardi]] Jewish community which immigrated from Spain after the [[Reconquista]] and the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. This Jewish Sephardi community spoke a form of [[Judaeo-Spanish]] known as [[Haketia]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Paloma|first=Vanessa|title=Judeo-Spanish in Morocco : Language, identity, separation or integration?|date=2012-09-28|url=http://books.openedition.org/cjb/217|work=La bienvenue et l'adieu {{!}} 1 : Migrants juifs et musulmans au Maghreb (XVe-XXe&nbsp;siècle)|pages=103–112|editor-last=Abécassis|editor-first=Frédéric|series=Description du Maghreb|publisher=Centre Jacques-Berque|isbn=9791092046083|editor2-last=Aouad|editor2-first=Rita|editor3-last=Dirèche|editor3-first=Karima}}</ref> According to the [[World Jewish Congress]] there were only 100 [[Moroccan Jews]] remaining in Tétouan by 2015.<ref>[https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/about/communities/MA Jewish in Morocco]</ref>

In 1790, a [[pogrom]] occurred, started by [[Sultan]] [[Yazid of Morocco|Yazid]]. The [[mellah]], where the Jews lived, was pillaged and many women raped.<ref>Norman A. Stilman (1979) ''The Jews of Arab Lands. A History and Source Book.'', 309;"''On Saturday, the second of the above-mentioned month of Sha'ban, our Master al-Yazid--may God grant him victory--ordered the pillaging of the Mellah of Tétouan. They fell upon the Jews' women and took their virginity, and they did not leave a single one of them.''"</ref> At this point there was an emigration of Tetouani Jews to [[Gibraltar]], where the large Jewish population maintains links with the community in Tetouan.

In 1807, Sultan [[Slimane of Morocco|Slimane]] relocated the mellah south of the medina to build a large mosque at its previous location inside the medina.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bcmediterranea.org/tanger-tetouan/fr/th%C3%A9matiques/villes/le-nouveau-mellah-de-t%C3%A9touan-et-la-synagogue-bengualid|title=BCmed|website=www.bcmediterranea.org|access-date=2019-10-16|archive-date=2019-10-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191016052508/http://www.bcmediterranea.org/tanger-tetouan/fr/th%C3%A9matiques/villes/le-nouveau-mellah-de-t%C3%A9touan-et-la-synagogue-bengualid|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Following the [[Migration of Moroccan Jews to Israel|exodus of Jews from Morocco after 1948]], there were very few [[Jew]]s left in Tétouan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://en.qantara.de/content/interview-with-mhammad-bennaboud-the-muslims-and-jews-of-tetouan|title=Interview with M'Hammad Bennaboud: The Muslims and Jews of Tétouan - Qantara.de|work=Qantara.de - Dialogue with the Islamic World|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en}}</ref> By 1967, only 12 remained (López Álvarez, 2003). During that period, many emigrated to [[South America]] and much later to [[Israel]], [[Spain]], [[France]], and [[Canada]]. Today, the only synagogue remaining is the [[Isaac Ben Walid Synagogue|Rabbi Isaac Bengualid Synagogue]], which serves as a museum.

===Modern history===
Tétouan was further expanded when it became the capital of the [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco]] between 1913 and 1956. The Spanish administration built several new neighborhoods outside the walled medina. The city underwent an intense urban transformation for which its new neighborhoods and buildings, called "[[:es:Ensanche de Tetuán|Ensanche]]" (meaning extension), acquired an image very similar to those of other Spanish cities of the time. Its structure was organized around a large circular [[plaza]], now called 'Plaza Mulay el Mehdi' (formerly Plaza [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]]).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sierra Ochoa |first=Alfonso de |title=El plano de la ciudad de Tetuán. |date=1960 |pages=20, 21, 25 |oclc=163789170}}</ref> The influence of the protectorate has remained important even after the independence of the country in 1956.

In January 1984, and in the midst of the [[Years of Lead (Morocco)|Years of Lead]] under the reign of [[Hassan II of Morocco|King Hassan II]] (died 1999), a revolt spread into several cities for a number of days due to price hikes for basic goods following the implementation of the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF's]] and the [[World Bank]]'s [[structural adjustment]] programme. The revolt was thwarted by a military intervention.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kamm |first=Henry |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/23/world/rioting-fomented-moroccan-asserts.html |title=Rioting Fomented, Moroccan Asserts |date=January 23, 1984 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-10-03 |page=Section A, Page 3 |language=en}}</ref> Twenty people were killed in Tétouan and many others were arrested and received heavy sentences.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kamm |first=Henry |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/24/world/envoys-estimate-60-have-died-in-moroccan-riots.html |title=Envoys Estimate 60 Have Died In Moroccan Riots |date=January 24, 1984 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-10-03 |pages=Section A, Page 2 |language=en}}</ref>

Many people in the city still speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. On road signs, names are often written both in Spanish and in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], though many signs are in Arabic and [[French language|French]], the second language of modern Morocco.

=== Architecture ===
The streets are fairly wide and straight, and many of the houses belonging to aristocratic families, descendants of those expelled from [[Al-Andalus]] by the Spanish Reconquista, possess marble fountains and have groves planted with orange trees. Within the houses and [[Moroccan riad|riads]] the ceilings are often exquisitely carved and painted in [[Hispano-Moresque]] designs, such as are found in the [[Alhambra]] of [[Granada]], and the tilework for which Tétouan is known may be seen on floors, pillars, and [[dado (architecture)|dados]].{{sfn|Meakin|1911}} The city has seven gates which were closed at night up until the early 20th century. Many [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Zawiya (institution)|Zawiyas]] are scattered inside the walled old city.

=== Food ===
Tétouan has rich culinary traditions unique within [[Moroccan cuisine]],<ref name=":3">{{Citation|title=Anny Gaul: "The cuisine of the city of Tetouan"|url=https://soundcloud.com/user-714421097/anny-gaul|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> and the influence of, [[Arab cuisine|Arab]], [[Amazigh]],<ref name=":3" /> [[Andalusian cuisine|Andalusi]], [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]] and [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]]<ref name=":3" /> cuisines is noted in the variety of dishes and pastries.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Authentic Recipes from Morocco.|last=Fatema.|first=Hal|date=2012|publisher=Tuttle Pub|others=Hamon, Jean., Barbey, Bruno.|isbn=9781462905409|location=New York|oclc=792688555}}</ref>

Amazigh and Arab cuisine are present in staples of Moroccan cuisine such as [[Couscous|cuscus]] and [[Rfissa|''rafissa'']] or ''[[Tharid|thrid]]'', respectively.<ref name=":3" />

As in other Moroccan cities like Salé and Fes, Tétouan inherited Andalusi culinary traditions through the waves of migration terminating with the arrival of the [[Expulsion of the Moriscos|expelled Moriscos]] 1609–1614.<ref name=":3" /> This manifests itself in classic dishes such as ''[[pastilla]]''. However, the pastilla traditionally made in Tetouan is more savory than sweet, with more [[preserved lemon]] and no sugar or almonds.<ref name=":3" />

Tétouan has been also influenced by Algerian and Ottoman cuisine, and this is due to the wave of migrants from [[Algeria]] following the [[French conquest of Algeria]].<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://presstetouan.com/news21064.html|title=الهجرات الجزائرية العثمانية الى تطوان|date=1970-01-01|website=بريس تطوان - أخبار تطوان|language=ar|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> This influence manifests itself prominently in the sweets of Tetouan, which include ''[[qatayef]]'' and [[baklava]].<ref name=":3" />

=== Crafts ===
Traditional craftsmanship is concentrated in the old medina where every industry has its own quarter with the same name where workshops and shops are found. Among them are [[Zellige]] (tilework), [[pottery]], [[Plasterwork|plaster engravings]], [[embroidery]], [[inlaying]] with silver wire, the manufacture of thick-soled yellow slippers, much-esteemed flintlocks, and artistic towels used as capes and skirts by [[Jebala people|Jebala women]] in rural areas.{{sfn|Meakin|1911}}

Traditional [[Andalusian classical music]] is the most popular and folk singers such as [[Abdessadeq Cheqara]] are widely known in Morocco. Other popular local genres like Taktoka Jabaliya also exist and are usually played at weddings.

Tétouan hosts many international festivals such as the International Mediterranean Film Festival, and the International Oud and Women's Voice (أصوات نسائية) Festival.

== Geography ==
[[File:A view of mount ghorghiz in Tetouan. .jpg|thumb|A view of the Rif mountains in Tétouan]]
The city is situated about 60&nbsp;km east of the city of [[Tangier]] and 40&nbsp;km south of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. To the south and west of the city, there are mountains. Tétouan is situated in the middle of a belt of [[orchard]]s that grow [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[almonds]], [[pomegranates]], and [[Mediterranean cypress|cypress]] trees. The [[Rif Mountains]] are nearby, as the city is located in the [[Martil Valley]]. It is picturesquely situated on the northern slope of a fertile valley down which flows the Martil river, with the harbour of Tétouan, [[Martil]], at its mouth. Behind rise rugged masses of rock, the southern wall of the Anjera country, once practically closed to Europeans; across the valley are the hills which form the northern limit of the still more impenetrable [[Rif]].{{sfn|Meakin|1911}}

===Climate===
Tétouan features a [[Mediterranean climate]] with [[Köppen climate classification]] of ''Csa''. Located along the Mediterranean Sea, the weather in Tétouan is mild, cold, and rainy during the winter, hot and dry in the summer months.

==Education==

===Education and the national movement===
During the 1920s, activists belonging to the national movement in northern Morocco, especially in Tétouan under [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco|Spanish protectorate]], made science and education a supreme goal of their struggle to combat colonialism. In 1924, and after considerable effort and determination, they established a primary school and named it the "Al Madrasa al-Ahliyah" ([[Arabic]]: المدرسة الأهلية meaning National School). Among them were historian [[Mohammed Daoud]], Abdel Salam Bennouna, and Mustafa Afilal. To this end, members of the National Movement carried out a popular campaign under the leadership of the Special Education Committee established in 1934. In the summer of 1935, a group of activists met at the house of Mustafa Afilal, and after a long debate about educational dimensions, material resources, and other things, the group concluded by approving the establishment of a special secondary educational institution. The name of the institution remained suspended until the end of the year. After additional meetings, nationalist leader and Professor [[Abdelkhalek Torres]], being impressed with the role played by the "free men" in the era of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], said to his colleagues: ''most of the men of science, thought and liberation in Spain, graduated from Madrid's ''Instituto Libre''. Therefore, I hope and suggest that you call our institute the Free Institute ([[Arabic]]: المعهد الحر)''. After this was approved, the Free Institute was established on November 5, 1935.<ref name="presstetouan.com">{{Cite news|url=http://presstetouan.com/news3501.html|title=معلومات جد هامة حول المعلمة التاريخية|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref>

The students of the Institute were among the first to demonstrate and protest against the Spanish administration. The year 1948, in which bloody events took place between the citizens demanding independence and the Spanish colonialism, in which a student of the institute was killed by colonial agents, was a milestone in its history. The Spanish administration began to take over the institute. All the staff were arrested and imprisoned in [[Ceuta]]. However, weeks later, historian [[Tuhami al-Wazzani]], who was then the director of the elementary school, joined the institute and asked the college students to help teach the younger ones so that the institute would not stop teaching altogether. Since then, secondary education has ceased and has been limited to primary education up to this day.<ref name="presstetouan.com"/> Many graduates continued their higher education in Spain, [[Cairo]], and [[Baghdad]].

===Other schools and institutions of higher education===
Tétouan is home to ''l'Institut National des Beaux-Arts'' (National Institute of Fine Arts), the only national arts institution of higher education in [[Morocco]]. It was founded in 1945.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://universes.art/en/nafas/articles/2013/inba-tetouan/|title=Institut National des Beaux-Arts Tétouan - When spontaneity and experimentation become forms|last=Saliou|first=Bérénice}}</ref> Its promoter and first director was the Spanish [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] painter {{Illm|Mariano Bertuchi|es}}.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Atlas of world art|date=2004|pages=291|publisher=Laurence King Pub|others=Onians, John, 1942-|isbn=978-1856693776|location=London|oclc=56535119}}</ref> The city also hosts the ''Ecole Nationale d'Architecture'', a public architecture school.

Tétouan's public [[Abdelmalek Essaâdi University]] was founded in 1993. The 16th-century Moroccan sultan [[Abu Marwan Abd al-Malik I Saadi]] is the university's namesake. The university has a student body of 86,000, one of the largest in Morocco. The Faculty of Theology ([[Arabic]] : كلية أصول الدين) was established in 1963 and was an affiliate of the prestigious [[University of Al Quaraouiyine|Al Quaraouiyine University]] in [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] until 2015, when it was annexed to Abdelmalek Essaâdi University.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fod.ac.ma/ar/%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%B0%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9|title=نبذة عن الكلية {{!}} كلية أصول الدين بتطوان|website=www.fod.ac.ma|language=ar|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref>

===Foreign cultural centers===
Several foreign cultural centers are located in Tétouan :
* Spanish [[Instituto Cervantes]]
* French [[Institut Français]]
* American Language Center

== Economy and infrastructure ==
[[Image:Coche unificado de 3º Clase del Ferrocarril Ceuta-Tetuán.JPG|thumb|right|300x300px|3rd-class carriage of the Ceuta-Tetuán Railway, circa 1930|alt=]]
The economy of the city is based mainly on tourism and commerce. Other sectors of income include fishing and agriculture. Tétouan's civil airport [[Sania Ramel Airport]], which became an international airport that operates flights to western Europe, is operated by the [[Moroccan Airports Authority]] and is located 6&nbsp;km (4&nbsp;mi) to the east.

[[Image:M%27diq_from_above.jpg|thumb|right|300x300px|[[M'diq]] harbour - Fishing and leisure port at Tamuda Bay |alt=]]
The [[Ceuta-Tetuán railway line]] ([[:es:Línea de ferrocarril Ceuta-Tetuán|es]]) was the first Spanish international railway line that would unite the cities of Ceuta and Tétouan. It was inaugurated on March 17, 1918, by [[Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|Carlos de Borbón]] and [[Khalifa (Morocco)|Khalifa]] {{ill|Mohammed Mehedi Uld Ben Ismael|es}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spanishrailway.com/2012/03/23/ferrocarril-de-ceuta-a-tetuan-protectorado-occidental-de-marruecos/|title=Spanish Railway » Blog Archive » Ferrocarril de Ceuta a Tetuán Protectorado Occidental de Marruecos|website=www.spanishrailway.com|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-10-04}}</ref> The line is no longer in use. Tétouan is linked to [[Tangier]], [[Ksar el-Kebir|Ksar el Kebir]], [[Larache]], [[Chefchaouen]], Bab Sebta (border with Ceuta), and [[Oued Laou]] via modern national motorways. The 28&nbsp;km [[Tetouan–Fnideq expressway]] was completed in 2005.

[[File:Road linking Tetouan to M'diq.jpg|thumb|left|Road linking Tetouan to M'diq]]
The coastal area is a major tourist destination during the summer period. It stretches from [[Fnideq]], a small city near [[Ceuta]], to the beaches of the small village of [[El Jebha]] on the route to [[Al Hoceima]]. Several [[marina]]s and beach resorts are spread between different villages along the coast. The [[M'diq]] port is the main fishing port serving the city. M'diq has another port dedicated to leisure. Both have been expanded recently in order to improve tourist offerings and to increase the harbour's capacity. Boats up to 50 metres long with a depth of nearly five metres can be moored.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.argolis-yacht.ru/School/Western_Mediterranean-2008/5.htm|title=Contents|last=Синицын|first=Александр|website=www.argolis-yacht.ru|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref>

Cultural tourism has also been developed during recent years. Many historical sites and monuments are found within and outside the old city (medina).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The medina : restoration & conservation of historic Islamic cities|author=Balbo, Marcello|date=2012|publisher=I.B. Tauris|isbn=9781848857131|oclc=855045724}}</ref>

During the 20th century, Tétouan had a few flourishing industries such as [[Paper mill|paper manufacturing]], which was led by the ''Papelera de Tetuán'' company.<ref>{{Citation |title=Latin American export and import volumes and prices|pages=208|doi = 10.1787/888932906331}}</ref> The company was later merged with its competitor ''Cellulose du Maroc'', having its operations stopped in Tétouan and its headquarters transferred to [[Casablanca]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Morocco, 2011.|date=2010|publisher=Oxford Business Group|isbn=978-1907065309|location=[Place of publication not identified]|pages=68|oclc=943709613}}</ref>

=== ''Skoundo'' water distribution system ===
The historic center is equipped with a subterranean piping system for water distribution through its streets. In fact, until the early 1970s, drinking water supply in the old medina was mainly provided through this traditional network called "Skoundo" (El Abdellaoui, 1986).<ref>{{Cite book|title=La Médina de Tétouan et son évolution récente étude de géographie urbaine|last=Mohamed.|first=El Abdellaoui|date=1986|publisher=[s.n.]|oclc=490592558}}</ref> It was developed around the 16th century in parallel with the construction of the first houses during its renewal by Andalusian refugees. It penetrates the ancient city from the far north to the far south. It starts at the top of Mount Dersa and extends underground under channels and pipes made of clay. Although it is not the only ancient water system in Morocco, others having been located in [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] and [[Chefchaouen]], it remains the only one still operating. However, the bad state of the clay pipes combined with neglect and other technical issues makes the water undrinkable, although some restorations are underway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medcities.org/documents/10180/384471/Round+Table+3_Tetouan.pdf/fe06700d-7a01-4cb7-b4cc-e0fca2c1093e|title=Programme de mise à niveau de ville de Tétouan}}</ref> Skoundo had a clear impact on various socio-economic charts of the city. The system did not only serve houses but also mosques, public toilets, hammams, tanneries, and public mural fountains found in each neighborhood in the old medina.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vqronline.org/essay/blind-plumber-tetouan|title=The Blind Plumber of Tetouan {{!}} VQR Online|website=www.vqronline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref>

=== Contraband controversies ===
Since a few decades, and because of the proximity of the city to the Spanish enclave of [[Ceuta]], many people have been relying on [[contraband]] activities. Residents of Tétouan do not need a visa to enter Ceuta. Before the 1990s, no passport was needed and a Moroccan ID card was sufficient. In recent years, the border has known many incidents such as stampedes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.efe.com/efe/english/portada/stampede-on-the-border-between-spain-s-ceuta-morocco-kills-2-women/50000260-3492294|title=Stampede on the border between Spain's Ceuta, Morocco kills 2 women|work=www.efe.com|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}</ref> Human rights groups have often criticized the situation in which women carry heavy loads of goods - giving rise to the epithet "Mule women"-<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.defenddemocracy.press/mule-women-morocco/|title=The 'Mule Women' of Morocco {{!}} Defend Democracy Press|last=Press|first=Defend Democracy|website=www.defenddemocracy.press|date=23 March 2016 |language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref> before cases of investigation were opened.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E-2016-009698+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=en|title=Written question - Illegal trade and human rights violations on the Ceuta border - E-009698/2016|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2018/07/250497/morocco-investigation-human-mules-ceuta/|title=Morocco Opens Investigation into Situation of 'Human Mules' at Ceuta Crossing Points|date=2018-07-13|work=Morocco World News|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-us}}</ref> In 2018 Morocco suspended commercial customs with the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla in to crack down on the smuggling of illegal products into Morocco from the two cities affecting the country’s economic growth.

{{Main|Moghreb Tétouan}}
In 1917, [[Tetouan]] saw the appearance of its first [[association football|football]] clubs, "Sporting of Tetuán" and "el Hispano-Marroquí" ("The Spanish-Moroccan"). One year later, these two clubs, and a third one called "el Radio", merged and that gave the birth to the "Athletic Club Tetuán". The new club was established in 1922 by Basque [[Atlético Madrid]] fans who lived in Tétouan. In the early days, it was known as Athletic Club Tetuan—based on the Spanish spelling of the city. After the [[Spanish Civil War]] and according to [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]]'s demands (banning non-Spanish names), it became known as Club Atlético Tetuan. This is why the team has always played in red and white stripes and blue shorts, just like their counterparts from Madrid they were supposed to emulate. Under the [[Spanish Morocco|Spanish protectorate of Northern Morocco]], Tetuán was a part of the [[La Liga|Spanish Liga]] for 33 years until independence was achieved in 1956. The highlights of that era were their surprising win of the [[Segunda División|Spanish Segunda División]] (the southern group) in the 1950–51 season<ref>[https://www.rsssf.org/tabless/span2champ.html Spain&nbsp;– List of Second Division Champions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and their promotion to the Primera Division of [[La Liga 1951-52|1951–52]]. The club remains, to this day, the only African team ever to play in a top division in Europe.

Today, the city has one professional football club, [[Moghreb Athletic Tétouan]], which competes in the [[Botola]], the top-tier of Moroccan football. The team plays their home games at the [[Saniat Rmel]] stadium, the oldest football stadium in Africa. As of the 2018–19 season, the team will play at the new Tétouan Stadium, which will have a seating capacity of more than 41,000. [[Moghreb Athletic Tétouan]] won its first league title in the 2011–12 [[Botola]] League season, becoming the first Chamali club to ever win the league title. Today, MAT is considered one of the five biggest football clubs in Morocco along with Raja Casablanca, Wydad Casablanca, FAR Rabat, and Maghreb Fès. A new football stadium in the Mediterranean city of Tétouan is currently being built across 36 hectares north of the residential areas, along the new A6 highway. It will occupy former farmlands and become the central sports arena of the agglomeration, replacing the severely dated Stade Saniat Rmel. The stadium is meant to seat 60,000 spectators; original plans called for a capacity of 40,000 but this was increased to 60,000 in order to meet latest FIFA regulations. Construction on the Grand Stade De Tétouan, which was designed by Moroccan architect [[Nawfal Bakhat]], began in 2015 and was initially scheduled for completion in 2018. The project has stalled a number of times, been mired in controversy regarding the authorship of its design plans,<ref>{{cite web|title=Rififi autour du Grand Stade de Tétouan |url=https://www.leconomiste.com/article/1038837-rififi-autour-du-grand-stade-de-tetouan |website=leconomiste.com |date=3 January 2019 |access-date=29 January 2020 |language=fr |trans-title=Turmoil around the Grand Stade de Tétouan}}</ref> and the completion date has been postponed as well. As of January 2020, it is still not finished. The Kingdom of Morocco has submitted a bid to FIFA to host the [[2026 FIFA World Cup|2026 World Cup]], which will be held in three different countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Cup 2026: Hosts, teams & TV info for the expanded tournament |url=https://www.goal.com/en-in/news/world-cup-2026-hosts-teams-tv-info-for-the-expanded/rssyceav8d2w1vwyuu7czi0pn |website=goal.com |date=25 July 2019 |access-date=29 January 2020}}</ref>
