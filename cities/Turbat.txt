'''Turbat''' ([[Urdu]] and {{langx|bal|{{nq|تربت}}}}) is a city in southern [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], [[Pakistan]]. It is the administrative centre of [[Kech District]]. Situated on the bank of the [[Kech River]] ({{langx|bal|کیچ کئور}}), Turbat was the historical capital of the [[Makran (princely state)|State of Makran]]. Turbat is [[List of cities in Balochistan, Pakistan by population|the second-largest city]] in Balochistan after [[Quetta]] and the [[List of most populous cities in Pakistan|38th largest city of Pakistan]]. It is the largest city in the southern part of the province. The [[Gwadar Port]] lies {{convert|180|km|mi|round=5}} southwest of Turbat.

==History==
In the 12th century, Turbat and its surrounding areas along with Iranian Makkuran were ruled by Prince Punnu(Mir Dosthein) and his father and his uncle Prince Aali khan and Prince Khosag Khan.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Nasir|first=Zeeshan|date=2019-03-11|title=Crumbling History: Punnu Fort In Balochistan In Deplorable State|url=https://nayadaur.tv/2019/03/crumbling-history-punnu-fort-in-balochistan-in-deplorable-state/|access-date=2020-07-22|website=Naya Daur|language=en-US}}</ref> Later, Turbat was ruled by the [[Gichki]] Tribes of [[Makran]] and as well ruled by the [[Buledi]] tribe about 400 years ago.
It was then the headquarters of the [[Makran (princely state)|Makran State]] and the Nawab of Makran resided in Shahi Tump near Turbat. When Makran State was dissolved, Turbat city remained the Division Headquarters. Turbat means "place or land of lovers". It has different historical places and associated stories.

==Overview==
The town is located in southern [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] province in [[Pakistan]]. It is situated on the left bank of the [[Kech River]] ({{langx|bal|کیچ کئور}}) which is a tributary to the [[Dasht River]] ({{langx|bal|دشت کئور}}). The [[Makran]] Range ({{langx|bal| مکُران بند}}) to the north and east descends to the coastal plains in the south. The town is a marketplace for dates grown in the surrounding region and has a date-processing factory. Jowar (sorghum), barley, wheat, and rice are also grown, and livestock are raised.

[[Koh-e-Murad]] ({{langx|bal|كوه مراد}}) is a shrine located in Turbat. This is a sacred place for [[Zikris]]. They believe that [[Mahdi]] the 12th imam had travelled to this place, and offered prayers for a long time. The followers of [[Zikri]] sect gather here annually on the night of 27th Ramadan for a [[ziyarat|ritual visit]] ({{langx|ar|زيارة}}, {{langx|bal|زيارت}}) to this shrine and Turbat also has multilingual singers.

The town has a special place in [[Baloch people|Baloch]] folklore and literature as it is the home of Punnu, hero of the romance of ''[[Sassi Punnun]]''. The remains of Punnu's fort can still be seen in Turbat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/weekly/herald/herald113.htm|title=District Profile: Southern Balochistan - Kech - Dawn}}</ref>

Atta Shad, who is considered one of the greatest poets of [[Balochi literature]] was also born in Singanisar, a town in Turbat city. He was not only versatile in Balochi poetry, but he was also greatly appreciated for his contribution in [[Urdu poetry]]. He was unique in his diction and style. He is credited to have written four books that include two Balochi books, Rochgir and Shap sahar indem, and two Urdu books, Singaab and Barfag. He died on 13 February 1998 in [[Quetta]], the capital of Balochistan province.<ref>Article by Ilyas Shad in 2013</ref>

Turbat is the birthplace of Qadir Bukhsh Rind Baloch alias [[Kadu Makrani]] was a 19th-century archetypal figure who was born and brought up in Makran, Balochistan. He rose as an insurgent in Kathiawar, Gujarat, martyred and buried in Karachi, Sindh in 1887. His final resting place in [[Mewa Shah Graveyard]] (Lyari) which has become the center of inspiration today. He is also remembered as ''the eastern Robin Hood''.

Koh-e-Imam lake is a Holy Place, its mountainous range stretches more than 15–25&nbsp;km from main Kech (Turbat) City. Where you find many picnic points as there are many natural water reservoirs, during rainy seasons.
In koh-e-imam there are also centuries old tombs we call them DAMD in Balochi Language. They are mysterious in a sense that people still don't find facts about the tombs aside of the river which is almost more than 100&nbsp;km.

Besides, Turbat is considered to be one of the main hubs of separatist insurgent groups active against [[Pakistan Armed Forces|Pakistani armed forces]] and the development projects running under the [[China-Pakistan Economic Corridor]]. The city has also witnessed violence against non-local men who have either come for business or serving government officials from other parts of Pakistan mostly from the [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] province. The city has come under discussion on media because of the attacks on non-local men or labourers of companies working on development projects. The city holds many military check points at the surroundings because of the security situation affected by the separatist insurgency. The security situation is now much improved.

The city is one of the most significant cities of Balochistan as the important Gwadar port is 180&nbsp;km away from the town. Gwadaris linked by the highway recently developed and improved under CPEC project. Turbat has an international airport that has many flights to the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf states]] of [[Oman]], the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] and [[Qatar]]. Although the city is not coastal but still has a newly built [[Pakistan Navy]] base camp which is being expanded to become a major air base in the future supporting Karachi. Turbat on its extreme South links with another coastal city of [[Pasni (city)|Pasni]] that comes administratively under [[Gwadar District|district Gwadar]]. In the Northwest it shares a border with [[Iran]] 120&nbsp;km away. The town members have a visa-free entry to Iran as many members have relatives at the Iranian side of the border. Diesel smuggling from the Iranian border remains one of the major source of income in the town that is smuggled to Karachi. The power line that feeds Turbat comes from Iran and the market is heavily filled by Iranian products.

==Transport==
Turbat has an [[Turbat International Airport|international airport]] which offers direct flights to [[Gwadar]], [[Karachi]], and [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]], UAE. The road network links Turbat with [[Kalat (Pakistan)|Kalat]] and [[Quetta]] to the northeast, Gwadar and [[Pasni City|Pasni]] to the south, [[Chabahar]] and [[Iranshahr, Iran|Iranshahr]] to the west, and [[Karachi]] to the east.

As part of the [[China-Pakistan Economic Corridor]] (CPEC) the [[M-8 motorway (Pakistan)|M-8 motorway]] is under construction but so far now links Turbat to [[Gwadar]], a major port city, and Hoshab.<ref>{{cite web |title=CPEC - Gwadar Turbat Hoshab |url=https://cpec.gov.pk/project-details/89}}</ref> In the future Turbat will be linked to northern [[Sindh]] by highway, which will allow economic development in the region by increased connectivity with the national transportation system. In November 2023, the [[Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority]] (CAA) upgraded the [[Turbat International Airport]] into a hub airport authorized to allow [[Airbus A320]] and [[Boeing 737]] transport. Before the upgrade, only small aircraft and the [[ATR 72]] were allowed to land. This is a big step in the infrastructure of Turbat, as this will allow direct flights by carriers from Turbat to cities across Pakistan and around the world. International sources speculate that flight operation from carriers would begin shortly after this upgrade.<ref>{{cite web |title=CAA upgrades Turbat International Airport |date=19 November 2023 |url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2023/11/19/caa-upgrades-turbat-international-airport/}}</ref>
