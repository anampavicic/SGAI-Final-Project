==History==
Ueda is located in former [[Shinano Province]] and during the [[Nara period]] was the [[kokufu|provincial capital]]. The ruins of the [[Shinano Kokubunji]] ([[provincial temple]]) are also located within Ueda. However, the provincial capital was shifted to Matsumoto during the early [[Heian period]]. During the [[Sengoku period]], the area was the centre of the powerful [[Sanada clan]]. During the [[Edo period]], Ueda was a [[jōkamachi|castle town]] and headquarters of [[Ueda Domain]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. During the post-[[Meiji restoration]] cadastral reform of April 1, 1889, the modern town of Ueda was established. Ueda was elevated to city status on May 1, 1919. On March 6, 2006, Ueda absorbed the neighbouring towns of [[Maruko, Nagano|Maruko]] and [[Sanada, Nagano|Sanada]], and the village of [[Takeshi, Nagano|Takeshi]] (all from [[Chiisagata District, Nagano|Chiisagata District]]).
