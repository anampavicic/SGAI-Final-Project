The first people to live in the area, the [[Spokane people|Spokane tribe]] (their name meaning "children of the sun" in [[Montana Salish language|Salishan]]), lived off plentiful game. [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] explored the area with the westward expansion and establishment of the [[North West Company]]'s [[Spokane House]] in 1810. This trading post was the first long-term European settlement in Washington. Completion of the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] in 1881 brought many settlers from America to the Spokane area. The same year it was officially incorporated as a city under the name of ''Spokane Falls'' (it was re-incorporated under its current name ten years later).<ref>{{historylink|title=Spokane Falls (later renamed Spokane) is incorporated as a first-class city on November 29, 1881.|article=9176|author=Laura Arksey|date=October 3, 2009|quote=The original Act of Incorporation spelled the city's name correctly, but the territorial printing office incorrectly spelled it Spokan Falls, a phonetic spelling that was used elsewhere during the period, including on the 1880 census. This spelling was also used for Spokane's first newspaper, the Spokan Times.|access-date=November 16, 2017}}</ref> In the late 19th century, gold and silver were discovered in the Inland Northwest. The local economy depended on mining, timber, and agriculture until the 1980s. Spokane hosted the first environmentally themed [[World's fair]] at [[Expo '74]].

Many of the downtown area's older [[Romanesque Revival]]-style buildings were designed by architect [[Kirtland Cutter|Kirtland Kelsey Cutter]] after the [[Great Spokane Fire|Great Fire of 1889]]. The city is also home to the [[Riverfront Park (Spokane, Washington)|Riverfront]] and [[Manito Park and Botanical Gardens|Manito]] parks, the Smithsonian-affiliated [[Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture]], the [[Davenport Hotel (Spokane)|Davenport Hotel]], and the [[Fox Theater (Spokane, Washington)|Fox]] and [[Bing Crosby Theater|Bing Crosby]] theaters.

The [[Cathedral of Our Lady of Lourdes (Spokane, Washington)|Cathedral of Our Lady of Lourdes]] is the [[cathedra|seat]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Spokane]], and the [[Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist (Spokane, Washington)|Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist]] serves as that of the [[Episcopal Diocese of Spokane]]. The [[Spokane Washington Temple]] in the east of the county serves [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. [[Gonzaga University]] was established in 1887 by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], and the private [[Presbyterian Church|Presbyterian]] [[Whitworth University]] was founded three years later and moved to north Spokane in 1914.

In sports, the region's professional and semi-professional sports teams include the [[Spokane Indians]] in [[Minor League Baseball]]. The [[Spokane Chiefs]] in the [[Western Hockey League]]. The [[Spokane Velocity]] in [[USL League One]] with a women's first division team [[Spokane Zephyr FC]] in [[USL Super League]]. The [[Gonzaga Bulldogs]] collegiate basketball team competes at the [[Division I (NCAA)|Division&nbsp;I]] level. As of 2010, Spokane's major daily newspaper, ''[[The Spokesman-Review]]'', had a daily circulation of over 76,000.

===American settlement===
[[File:SpokaneMap1890GiesAndCompanyofBuffaloNew York.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Spokane Falls in 1890|Spokane Falls, 1890]]
Joint American–British occupation of [[Oregon Country]], in effect since the [[Treaty of 1818]], eventually led to the [[Oregon Boundary Dispute]] after a large influx of American settlers along the [[Oregon Trail]]. Great Britain ceded its claims to lands in [[Puget Sound]] and the central and lower Columbia Basin by the [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846. The Hudson's Bay Company wound up its operations in the area over the next few years.

In what is now Spokane, the first American settlers were J.J. Downing and S.R.

Spokane's neighborhoods range from the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]-style South Hill and Browne's Addition, to the Davenport District of Downtown, to the more contemporary neighborhoods of north Spokane. Spokane's neighborhoods are gaining attention for their history, as illustrated by the city being home to 18 recognized [[National Register of Historic Places|National Register Historical Districts]].<ref name="CC" /><ref>{{cite web |date=September 13, 2012 |title=Thousands of Preservationists Will Gather in Spokane, Washington to Discuss the Power of Preservation to Create Jobs, Enrich Communities and Drive Social Change |url=http://www.preservationnation.org/who-we-are/press-center/press-releases/2012/thousands-of-preservationists.html#.U1yN4KIqfFw |access-date=December 7, 2014 |publisher=National Trust for Historic Preservation}}</ref><ref>{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>

Some of Spokane's best-known neighborhoods are [[Neighborhoods in Spokane, Washington#Riverside|Riverside]], [[Neighborhoods in Spokane, Washington#Browne.27s Addition|Browne's Addition]], and [[Hillyard, Spokane|Hillyard]]. The Riverside neighborhood consists primarily of downtown Spokane and is the central business district of Spokane. The neighborhoods south of downtown Spokane are collectively known as the South Hill. Downtown Spokane contains many of the city's public facilities, including City Hall, Riverfront Park (site of Expo '74), and the Spokane Convention Center, First Interstate Center for the Arts and Spokane Arena. The Spokane County Courthouse and public safety campus is adjacent to downtown in the historic [[Neighborhoods in Spokane, Washington#West Central|West Central]] neighborhood. To the east of downtown is [[Neighborhoods in Spokane, Washington#East Central|East Central]] and the adjacent [[University District (Spokane, Washington)|University District]] and budding "International District". To the west of downtown is one of Spokane's oldest and densest neighborhoods, Browne's Addition.

A National Historic District west of Downtown, Browne's Addition was Spokane's first prestigious address, notable for its array of old mansions built by Spokane's early elite in the [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne]] and early [[American Craftsman]] styles.<ref name="BA">Stratton (2005), pp. 168–169</ref> The area houses the Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture. In northeast Spokane, the Hillyard neighborhood began in 1892 as the chosen site for James J. Hill's Great Northern Railway yard, placed outside Spokane city limits to avoid "burdensome taxes".<ref name="Hillyard" /> The downtown Hillyard Business District, located on Market Street, was the first Spokane neighborhood listed in the National Register of Historic Places.<ref name="Hillyard" /> Many of the former town's houses were built to house railroad workers, mainly immigrant laborers working in the local yard, who gave Hillyard an independent, blue-collar character.<ref name="Hillyard" /> Hillyard has become a home for much of Spokane's growing [[Russians|Russian]], [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], and [[Southeast Asia]]n communities.<ref name="Hillyard" /><ref name="TheTimes" /><ref name="TheSpokesman" />

The principal architect of many buildings of this period was [[Kirtland Cutter|Kirtland Kelsey Cutter]].<ref name="Thumbnail" /> Self-taught, he came to Spokane in 1886, and began by designing "Chalet Hohenstein" for himself and other residences for his family, while also working as a bank teller.<ref>{{cite web |last=Arksey |first=Laura |date=March 23, 2009 |title=Cutter, Kirtland Kelsey (1860–1939), Architect |url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=115 |access-date=November 2, 2014 |work=Essay 115 |publisher=HistoryLink}}</ref> Other structures designed by Cutter include the Spokane Club, Washington Water Power Substation, [[Monroe Street Bridge (Spokane River)|Monroe Street Bridge]] (featured in the city seal), the [[Central Steam Heat Plant|Steam Plant]], and the [[Davenport Hotel (Spokane)|Davenport Hotel]]. Built in renaissance and Spanish Revival style, the Davenport Hotel cost two million dollars to complete and included new technologies at the time of its opening in September 1914, such as chilled water, elevators, and air cooling.<ref name="Davenport" />

In contemporary times, one of the city's foremost and influential architects has been Warren C.

As an early affluent Spokane neighborhood, the Browne's Addition neighborhood and residences contain the largest variety of residential architecture in the city.<ref name="BA" /> These residences are lavish and personalized, featuring many architectural styles that were popular and trendy in the Pacific Northwest from the late 19th century to 1930, such as the Victorian and Queen Anne styles.<ref>{{cite web |title=Historic Districts of Spokane: Browne's Addition Historic District |url=http://properties.historicspokane.org/district/?DistrictID=18 |access-date=November 3, 2014 |publisher=City – County of Spokane Historic Preservation Office}}</ref> In high demand following his firms' design of the [[Idaho Building (Chicago World's Fair)|Idaho Building]] at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]] in 1893, Cutter found work constructing many mansions for mining and railroad tycoons such as [[Patsy Clark Mansion|Patrick "Patsy" Clark]] and Daniel C. Corbin and son Austin.<ref>Stratton (2005), pp. 167–173</ref>

The older neighborhoods of the early 20th century, such as West Central, East Central, [[Logan, Spokane|Logan]], Hillyard, and much of the lower South Hill, feature a large concentration of American Craftsman style [[bungalow]]s. In Hillyard, the most architecturally intact neighborhood in Spokane, 85 percent of these buildings are historic.<ref>{{cite news |date=September 20, 2001 |title=Historic Hillyard |url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/news-story.asp?date=092001&ID=s1026394 |access-date=November 2, 2014 |newspaper=The Spokesman-Review}}</ref> As the city expanded mainly to the north in the middle of the 20th century, the bungalows in the "minimal traditional" style commonplace from the 1930s to the 1950s tend to predominate in the Northwest, North Hill, and [[Bemiss, Spokane|Bemiss]] neighborhoods. This architectural style occupies the neighborhoods where the integrity of Spokane's street grid pattern is largely intact (especially the areas north of downtown and south of Francis Ave.), and the houses have backyard [[alley]]s for carports, deliveries, and refuse collection. Contemporary suburbs and architecture are prevalent at the north and south edges of Spokane as well as in the new Kendall Yards neighborhood north of downtown.<ref>{{cite news |last=McLean |first=Mike |date=January 14, 2010 |title=Greenstone to jump-start urban project |url=http://www.spokanejournal.com/local-news/greenstone-to-jump-start-urban-project |access-date=November 24, 2014 |publisher=Spokane Journal of Business}}</ref>

Major east–west thoroughfares in the city include Francis, Wellesley, Mission, Sprague, and 29th Avenues. Major north–south thoroughfares include Maple–Ash, Monroe, Division, Hamilton, Greene–Market (north of I-90), and Ray–Freya (south of I-90) Streets.

====Mass transportation====
{{See also|Spokane Transit Authority}}
Before the influx of automobiles, Spokane's electric [[Spokane and Inland Empire Railroad|streetcar and interurban lines]] played a dominant role in moving people and goods around Spokane. Streetcars were installed as early as 1888, when they were pulled by horses.<ref>Creighton (2013), p.64</ref> Many older side streets in Spokane still have visible streetcar rails embedded in them. Streetcar service was reduced due to declining ridership beginning in 1922, and by August 1936, all lines had been abandoned or converted to motor buses.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kershner |first=Jim |title=Spokane's Streetcars |work=Essay 8080 |publisher=HistoryLink |date=January 25, 2007 |url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=8080| access-date = December 7, 2014}}</ref>

==Notes==
{{Refbegin|30em}}
{{note|Spukcane|[a]}}The name is said to derive from ''Spukcane'', the vocalization of a sound made by a snake which the Chief of the Spokanes came to call "power from the brain" after pondering it made his head vibrate. It is unknown when the present meaning of the word, "Sun People" replaced this earlier meaning.<ref name="Spukcane"/><br />
{{note|Glover|[b]}}Unbeknownst to them, the Spokane Valley was the only area within 200 miles that could provide passage to the Inland Empire through the Rockies at a reasonable grade.<ref name="p. 19" /><br />
{{note|incorp|[c]}}The present name, set forth by an 1891 charter reincorporated the city under the name "Spokane Falls", stating: ''"The corporate name of the city is Spokane Falls, and by that name shall have perpetual succession" (Charter, Article I).'' However, a later article in that same charter which was voted on concurrently changed the name to "Spokane".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Spokane, Washington |title=Charter of the city of Spokane, Washington: approved by the people at an election held March 24, 1891, attested and went into effect April 4, 1891 (including amendments). |publisher=W.D.

Reavis tells of Spokane's significance to the Inland Northwest region as an [[wikt:entrepôt|entrepôt]] distributing center (largely the city's [[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]]) in his 1891 Annual Report, writing: "By reason of her geographical position and railroad connections Spokane is fitted as no other city is, or ever can be, to be the distributing center of all that country within a radius of 150 miles, and in some instances territory much farther away. There is no point 150 miles from Spokane that is not at least 225 miles from any other city of 10,000 population. We have about us a territory of 60,000 square miles in extent, to every point of which we are nearer than any other city, to every point of which we have better railroad connections and easier grades than any other city ... We have eight lines of railroad that radiate out in all directions through it, so that shipments made here in the morning can reach any point within its borders by nightfall. We have a telephone system connecting us with almost every shipping town and shipping station within its borders. Goods may be ordered, shipped and received, in most instances, within one day. Never was a city more intimately knit to its surrounding territory than Spokane, and never was one more free from a legitimate rival in trade ..."<ref>{{cite report |last=Reavis |first=John R. |date=1892 |title=''First Annual Report of the Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce of Spokane for the Year 1891'' |url=http://www.washington.edu/uwired/outreach/cspn/Website/Classroom%20Materials/Curriculum%20Packets/Building%20Nature/Documents/2.html |publisher=W.D.

{{note|investment|[e]}}The financing for rebuilding the downtown core came in large part from the infusion of investment from Dutch bankers; this investment was so deep that by 1896, one prominent Dutch mortgage company, the ''Northwestern and Pacific Hypotheekbank'' owned a quarter of the city.<ref>Stratton (2005), p. 33, p. 200</ref><br />
{{note|Hepburn|[f]}}In 1892, the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] agreed with the city after it filed a complaint about these practices, but that decision was struck down by a federal court.
