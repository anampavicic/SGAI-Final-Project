Haikou was originally a port city, serving as the port for [[Qiongshan District|Qiongshan]]. During the [[Chinese Civil War]], Haikou was one of the last [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Nationalist]] strongholds to be taken by the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] — with the [[Battle of Hainan Island]] in 1950. Currently, more than half of the island's total trade still goes through Haikou's ports. The [[Temple of the Five Lords]] is located to the southeast of the city.

The city is home to [[Hainan University]], a comprehensive [[research university]] under the [[Project 211]] and the [[Double First Class University Plan]] in certain disciplines,<ref name="Chinese Department of Education">{{Cite web|script-title=zh:教育部 财政部 国家发展改革委 关于公布世界一流大学和一流学科建设高校及建设 学科名单的通知|trans-title=Notice from the Ministry of Education and other national governmental departments announcing the list of double first class universities and disciplines|url=http://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A22/moe_843/201709/t20170921_314942.html|publisher=[[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China]]|language=zh}}</ref> which has its main campus on [[Haidian Island]].

==History==
The [[Chinese characters|hanzi]] characters comprising the city's name, {{lang|zh|{{linktext|海口}}}}, mean ''ocean''/''sea'' and ''mouth''/''port'', respectively.  Thus, the name "Haikou" is also a word for "seaport" – similar to [[Portsmouth]] in Britain.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}} Haikou originally served as the port for [[Qiongshan]], the ancient administrative capital of Hainan island, located some {{Convert|5|km|abbr=on}} inland to the south east. During its early history Haikou was a part of [[Guangdong]] province. In the 13th century it was fortified and became a military post under the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644). The port is located west of the mouth of the [[Nandu River]], Hainan's principal river. When Qiongshan was opened to foreign trade under the [[Treaty of Tianjin]] in 1858, Haikou started to rival the old administrative city. It was formerly known internationally as 'Hoihow', based on the Cantonese pronunciation by the [[British Raj]] officers. In 1926, Haikou overtook Qiongshan in population and it was declared a separate administrative city.

The city and island of Hainan stayed under the control of the Nationalists until April 1950, when it fell to the Communists during the [[Battle of Hainan Island|Landing Operation on Hainan Island]].

Since 1949, Haikou has maintained its position as Hainan's main port, handling more than half of the island's total trade. It has replaced Qiongshan as the island's administrative capital. In 1988, Haikou was made a [[prefecture-level city]] as well as the capital of the newly created Hainan Province.

Haikou old town contains a small portion of the oldest buildings in Haikou city that returnees from overseas built. The houses are a mixture of styles including [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[France|French]], and Southeast Asian. The streets used to be divided into different areas selling Chinese and western medicine, for [[silk]] and [[bespoke]] clothes, one for fresh fish and meat, and others for the sale of incense, candles, paper, ink, and other goods.

Various projects are currently under discussion to decide the best way to restore and preserve these historical buildings.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

==Geography==
[[File:Haikou city map - 01.png|thumb|right|Haikou city map]]
Haikou is situated on the north coast of Hainan Island, by [[Haikou Bay]], facing the [[Leizhou Peninsula]] across the [[Qiongzhou Strait]] that stretches west from [[Beibu Bay]] near [[Vietnam]] to the [[James Shoal]] bordering the [[South China Sea]] to the west. Most of the city is almost completely flat and only a few metres above sea level. It has an area of {{Convert|2,304.84|km2|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haikou.gov.cn/zlhk/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=33602|title=Geography of Haikou|publisher=Official website of Haikou government|date=2008-04-01|access-date=2008-06-11|language=zh|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206225318/http://www.haikou.gov.cn/zlhk/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=33602|archive-date=2009-02-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[Meishe River]] winds through the east side of the city flowing northward to the [[Haidian River]].

The northern part of Haikou City, the district of [[Haidian Island]], is separated from the main part of Haikou by the Haidian River, a tributary of the [[Nandu River]]. The district is accessed by one of four bridges, the largest being [[Haikou Century Bridge]], which connects the Guomao district with Haidian Island at the estuary of the Haidian River. From east to west the remaining three road connections are provided by the Renmin, Heping and Xinbu Bridges.

Directly to the northeast of Haikou and to the east of Haidian Island is [[Xinbu Island]].

==Climate==
{{Further|Hainan#Annual fog}}
Haikou is on the northern [[tropical zone]], and is part of the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]]. April to October is the active period for tropical storms and typhoons, most of which occur between August and September. May to October is the rainy season with the heaviest rainfall occurring in September. The city has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Aw''). Extremes since 1951 have ranged from {{convert|2.8|°C|0}} on 12 January 1955 to {{convert|41.3|°C|0}} on 30 April 2024.

===Environment===
{{asof|2018}}, Haikou has the second best air quality among major cities nationally, preceded only by [[Lhasa]], [[Tibet]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ecns.cn/news/society/2018-08-19/detail-ifyxccrz0968110.shtml |title = China reports better air quality in July}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last2=Thai|first2=Michael|last1=Hong|first1=Lin|title=Fuzhou ranks third in air quality across the nation
|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/fuzhou/e/2013-01/31/content_16191595.htm|website=chinadaily.com.cn|publisher=ChinaDaily
|access-date=2014-06-18}}</ref>  However, since approximately 2009, due to an increase in the number of automobiles, there has been somewhat worsening air pollution.

According to the 2005 statistical book issued by the National Bureau of Statistics, Haikou scored the highest among China's main cities in [[air quality]], with 366 days (2004) of ambient air quality equal to or above grade II, with only 0.033 milligrams/m<sup>2</sup> of [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] (the least of all main cities), 0.003 milligrams/m<sup>2</sup> of [[sulphur dioxide]] (only [[Lhasa]] had less), and 0.013 milligrams/m<sup>2</sup> of [[nitrogen dioxide]] (the least of all main cities).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allcountries.org/china_statistics/12_7_ambient_air_quality_in_main.html |title=Ambient Air Quality in Main Cities (2004) in China Statistics 2005 |access-date=2010-06-27}}</ref>

In 1995, the Haikou city government began an initiative to improve the quality of life for its residents. With the approval of the [[World Health Organization]], and [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Health]], a ten-point plan was undertaken to address such issues as:

*Community [[health care]]
*[[Vaccinations]] for children
*[[Waste recycling]]
*[[Green belt]]s and urban trees
*[[Environmentally friendly]] construction
*Public toilets (These are available throughout the city, are staffed, and well maintained.)
*[[Sewage treatment]]
*[[Communications]]
*[[Noise pollution]]

The [[groundwater]] is of [[international standard]]{{clarify|date=February 2012}}, and is classified as [[mineral water]].

By 2004, the city had established 43 new community health service centers reaching 85 percent of the population. The initiative has increased the size of Haikou's green spaces to 2,000 [[hectare]]s, with trees lining 40 percent of its roads. [[Noise pollution]] has dropped from 61.1[[decibel|db]] to 58.2db and 300 public toilets have been built. All industrial effluents, [[industrial waste]] water and solid waste, and all live [[sewage]], is now processed through [[waste treatment|centralized treatment]] centers, and is disposed of without [[Environmental degradation|environmental impact]]. These improvements and others have increased [[life expectancy]] in Haikou to 78.26 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/China/105308.htm |title=Haikou's Healthy New Environment |publisher=China.org.cn |date=2004-08-27 |access-date=2010-10-18}}</ref>

Haikou city has also built 163 model [[ecological]] villages. Now, over 200,000 villagers in 933 villages have tap water in their homes.

====Comprehensive city-improvement campaign====
During 2015 and 2016, large-scale city improvements have taken place as part of a province-wide initiative called "double create" ({{lang|zh-hans|双创}}). It is described by government sources as a campaign to create a cleaner city and create a more civilized city. It is focused on traffic and commerce, but has also improved the overall appearance of the city, tackling air pollution from industry emissions, aiming to ensure the safety of drinking water sources, improving public security in such places as hospitals, schools, malls, and visitor attractions.<ref>{{cite web |language=zh-hans |url=http://www.hainan.gov.cn/data/news/2015/08/174510/|script-title=zh:-- 海南省人民政府网|website=www.hainan.gov.cn}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://news.0898.net/GB/368630/372289/372613/index.html |title=海口市"双创"工作动员大会--人民网海南视窗--人民网 |access-date=2015-09-29 |archive-date=2015-09-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930024145/http://news.0898.net/GB/368630/372289/372613/index.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |language=zh-hans |url=http://www.hinews.cn/news/system/2015/08/07/017747091.shtml|script-title=zh:为海口“双创”从啃硬骨头下手点赞__海南新闻网_南海网|last=冉苗俊|website=www.hinews.cn}}</ref> Details of these improvements include:

*Traffic: Many new street crossings with traffic lights were installed around the city to improve two-wheel vehicles (consisting mainly of electric motorbikes) and pedestrian travel. Throughout the city, teams of police have been stationed at major intersections to ensure that two-wheel vehicles obey the law. Although there are many side lanes for these bikes, the actual pedestrian sidewalks serve as legal, one-way routes. Police at intersections stop vehicles either going the wrong way, or running red lights and the offenders may be forced to wear a red sash, stop other offenders, and lecture them.
*Commerce: Around August 2015, teams of officers physically removed nearly all illegal structures used for business in the city (a province-wide campaign) which were commonly made of corrugated metal or cinderblocks and were shop extensions or simply unused space that had been built upon. Street vendors were banned (most of whom sold vegetables or fruit), as was the night operation of roadside BBQ sites and the placement of tables onto the sidewalks by restaurants. These night time food operations were once common throughout the city.
*Roads and sidewalks: Many small roads have been repaved including narrow lanes in old neighbourhoods. Also, many sidewalks have been upgraded with new brick. Bricks are used as sidewalk material in Haikou because of the large amount of ficus trees, the roots of which deform the surrounding sidewalk.
*Demolition and reconstruction: A number of entire neighbourhoods within the city have been, and are being, entirely demolished with new buildings and roads being built.
*Starting around the beginning of 2018, the city government funded painting and [[Cladding (construction)|cladding]] of a number of buildings in the city centre.

===Water and sewage treatment===
The treatment of Haikou's wastewater, and the supply of tap water is operated by the French company [[Veolia Water]]. The partial privatization agreement gives 49 percent ownership to Veolia Water in a 30-year joint venture with Haikou Water Group (2012–2042).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://haikouvw.com/en/info_en.html |script-title=zh:海口威立雅水务 |publisher=Haikouvw.com |access-date=2011-12-27 |archive-date=2012-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426072834/http://haikouvw.com/en/info_en.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwaterintel.com/archive/8/6/general/veolias-big-bid-for-haikou-water.html |title=Veolia's big bid for Haikou Water &#124; Global Water Intelligence – Archive: Global Water Intelligence|publisher=Globalwaterintel.com |access-date=2011-12-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ppi.worldbank.org/explore/PPIReport.aspx?ProjectID=4500|title=Haikou City No. 1 Water Affairs Company Limited – Individual Project Information – Private Infrastructure Projects – The World Bank & PPIAF|publisher=Ppi.worldbank.org |access-date=2011-12-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hkcopinfo.com/detial/cps.asp?key=1087894-6c5d2516 |script-title=zh:威立雅水務(海口)投資有限公司注册信息&#124;Veolia Water (Haikou) Investment Co.

===Urban===
Haikou has an extensive urban bus service. Standard fare is 1 yuan, with no bus pass, ticket, or transfer system in place. Urban minibuses operated prior to 2009, but have since been phased-out. Taxi automobiles and electric motorbikes operate throughout the city. During 2009–2010, petrol-fueled motorbike taxis were banned and seized by police at numerous checkpoints within the city.

Haikou has experienced a substantial increase in cars since the early 2000s. Traffic on main streets, once light, is now similar to other major cities, with rush hour problems that have prompted the city to expand several main roads and build a new elevated road from the west end of Guoxing Avenue to new developments west of Holiday Beach.

Many main roads in the city have a side lane, separated by a median, for two-wheeled vehicles.

Physical barriers were installed on many of the main two-way streets throughout the city in order to separate opposing lanes. These were installed for safety reasons to prevent pedestrians from crossing the streets at locations other than intersections.

Roundabouts are not prevalent in Haikou, being used mainly on Hai Xiu road, and a few other locations.

Traffic cameras are used at many main intersections in the city, with tickets being issued by post for traffic light infractions.

There is one tunnel in the city, the [[Qiaozhong Road Tunnel]].

====Shared bicycles====
[[File:Haikou public bike rental 01.jpg|thumb|A Haikou Public Bicycle System station.]]

By April, there were about 40,000 of these types of bikes available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecns.cn/cns-wire/2017/04-24/254707.shtml|title=Hainan to record unruly shared bike usage in personal credit system|website=www.ecns.cn}}</ref> [[Ofo (bike sharing)|Ofo]], [[Mobike#Classic Mobike|Mobike]], and "Quick to" all cost 2 RMB per hour. Ofo and "Quick to" bikes have tires with tubes, meaning many are left around the city with flat tires. The Haikou Public Bicycle System has installed a number of new, more modern bikes with tires that cannot be punctured. Part of Mobike's fleet also uses these types of tires.
