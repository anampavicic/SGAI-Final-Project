Escobedo was known as "Topo de los Ayala" and was under Monterrey's jurisdiction in 1830, it was until 1867 that it was separated from the San Nicolas de los Garza municipality under governor Jerónimo Treviño and was thus decreed on February 24, 1868 becoming the "Villa de Gral. Escobedo".

==History==
The land was originally known as "Los Llanos del Topo" (Hills of the Topo). The first owner of these lands was Captain [[José de Treviño]], who was granted the territory on April 25, 1604 by Gov. [[Diego de Montemayor]]. Although Treviño was the original owner, the city itself was established by his son [[José de Ayala]] with the "Hacienda del Topo de San Nicolas Tolentino" by the time known as "Topo de los Ayala" or "Topo Grande", not to be confused with "Topo de los Gonzalez" or "Topo Chico".

In recent years Escobedo has undergone major growth, with many urban projects like [[shopping mall]]s and the expansion of the "Escobedo [[Industrial park|Industrial Park]].The town was the location of [[Blue Diamond Truck]]s, a joint venture between [[Navistar]] and [[Ford Motor Company]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.internationaldelivers.com/Site_Layout/Escobedo/Escobedo_HomePage.asp |title=Escobedo Home Page |access-date=2009-02-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222194754/http://internationaldelivers.com/site_layout/Escobedo/escobedo_homepage.asp |archive-date=2009-02-22 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fleetowner.com/mag/fleet_blue_diamond_formed/|title=Blue Diamond formed|date=1 September 2001}}</ref> until that company was dissolved in 2009.
