Queensland was explored in subsequent decades, and the [[Moreton Bay Penal Settlement]] was established at Brisbane in 1824 by [[John Oxley]]. During the [[Australian frontier wars]] of the 19th century, colonists killed tens of thousands of Aboriginal people in Queensland while consolidating their control over the territory.

On 6 June 1859 (now commemorated as [[Queensland Day]]), [[Queen Victoria]] signed the letters patent to establish the colony of Queensland, [[separation of Queensland|separating it from New South Wales]] and thereby establishing Queensland as a [[Self-governing colony|self-governing]] [[Crown colony]] with [[responsible government]]. A large part of colonial Queensland's economy relied on [[Blackbirding|blackbirded]] South Sea Islander slavery.{{Citation needed|date=August 2024}}

Queensland was among the six colonies which became the founding states of Australia with [[federation of Australia|Federation]] on 1 January 1901. Since the [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen|Bjelke-Petersen]] era of the late 20th century, Queensland has received a high level of internal migration from the other states and territories of Australia and remains a popular destination for interstate migration.

Queensland has the [[list of Australian states and territories by gross state product|third-largest economy]] among Australian states, with strengths in mining, agriculture, transportation, [[international student|international education]], insurance, and banking. Nicknamed the ''Sunshine State'' for its tropical and sub-tropical climates, [[Great Barrier Reef]], and numerous beaches, tourism is also important to the state's economy.

{{Main|History of Indigenous Australians}}

Queensland was one of the largest regions of pre-colonial Aboriginal population in Australia.{{Sfnp|Ørsted-Jensen|2011|pp=10–11}} The Aboriginal occupation of Queensland is thought to predate 50,000&nbsp;BC, and early migrants are believed to have arrived via boat or land bridge across [[Torres Strait]]. Through time, their descendants developed into more than 90 different language and cultural groups.

During the last [[ice age]], Queensland's landscape became more arid and largely desolate, making food and other supplies scarce. The people developed the world's first seed-grinding technology.<ref>{{cite journal|title=65,000-years of continuous grinding stone use at Madjedbebe, Northern Australia {{!}} Abstract|journal=Scientific Reports|publisher=Nature|date=11 July 2022|volume=12 |issue=1 |page=11747 |doi=10.1038/s41598-022-15174-x |last1=Hayes |first1=Elspeth H. |last2=Fullagar |first2=Richard |last3=Field |first3=Judith H. |last4=Coster |first4=Adelle C.

The [[Torres Strait Islands]] is home to the [[Torres Strait Islanders|Torres Strait Islander peoples]]. Torres Strait Islanders are ethnically and culturally distinct from mainland Aboriginal peoples. They have a long history of interaction with both Aboriginal peoples of what is now Australia and the peoples of [[New Guinea]].

In February 1606, Dutch navigator [[Willem Janszoon]] landed near the site of what is now [[Weipa, Queensland|Weipa]], on the western shore of [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]]. This was the first recorded landing of a European in [[Australia]], and it also marked the first reported contact between Europeans and the [[Aboriginal people of Australia]].<ref name="r-evans-hoq"/> The region was also explored by French and Spanish explorers (commanded by [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] and [[Luís Vaez de Torres]], respectively) before the arrival of Lieutenant [[James Cook]] in 1770. Cook claimed the east coast under instruction from [[King George III]] of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] on 22 August 1770 at [[Possession Island (Queensland)|Possession Island]], naming eastern Australia, including Queensland, ''New South Wales''.<ref>{{cite web|website=culture.gov.au |url=https://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/australianhistory/ |title=European discovery and the colonisation of Australia |access-date=24 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216230554/https://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/australianhistory/ |archive-date=16 February 2011}}</ref>

The Aboriginal population declined significantly after a [[History of smallpox#Australasian epidemics|smallpox epidemic]] during the late 18th century and massacres by the European settlers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cumpston|first=JHL|title=The History of Small-Pox in Australia 1788–1908|year=1914|publisher=Australian Government Printer|location=Melbourne}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=January 2024}}

In 1823, [[John Oxley]], a British explorer, sailed north from what is now [[Sydney]] to scout possible penal colony sites in [[Gladstone, Queensland|Gladstone]] (then [[Port Curtis]]) and [[Moreton Bay]]. At Moreton Bay, he found the [[Brisbane River]]. He returned in 1824 and established a penal settlement at what is now [[Redcliffe Peninsula|Redcliffe]]. The settlement, initially known as [[Edenglassie]], was then transferred to the current location of the [[Brisbane central business district|Brisbane city centre]]. [[Edmund Lockyer]] discovered outcrops of coal along the banks of the upper Brisbane River in 1825.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newhopegroup.com.au|title=New Hope Group|access-date=25 February 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227032917/https://www.newhopegroup.com.au/|archive-date=27 February 2014}}</ref> In 1839 transportation of convicts was ceased, culminating in the closure of the Brisbane penal settlement. In 1842 free settlement, which had already commenced, was officially permitted. In 1847, the [[Port of Maryborough]] was opened as a wool port. While most early immigrants came from New South Wales, the first free immigrant ship to arrive in Moreton Bay from Europe was the [[Artemisia (ship)|''Artemisia'']], in 1848.

Earlier than this immigrant ship was the arrival of the Irish famine orphan girls to Queensland. Devised by the then British Secretary of State for the Colonies, The Earl Grey Scheme established a special emigration scheme which was designed to resettle destitute girls from the workhouses of Ireland during the Great Famine. The first ship, the "Earl Grey", departed Ireland for a 124-day sail to Sydney. After controversy developed upon their arrival in Australia, a small group of 37 young orphans, sometimes referred to as The Belfast Girls or the Feisty Colleens, never set foot on Sydney soil, and instead sailed up to Brisbane (then Moreton Bay) on 21 October 1848 on board the ''Ann Mary''. This scheme continued until 1852.<ref>{{Citation|author1=Harrison|first=Jennifer|title=The Forty-Niners: Brisbane : schemes and dreams nineteenth century arrivals|date=4 July 2014|pages=47|publication-date=2014|publisher=Brisbane History Group; Salisbury Qld. : Boolarong Press|isbn=978-1-925046-99-1}}</ref>

The wars featured the most frequent massacres of First Nations people, the three deadliest massacres on white settlers, the most disreputable frontier police force, and the highest number of white victims to frontier violence on record in any Australian colony.{{Sfnp|Ørsted-Jensen|2011}} Across at least 644 collisions at least 66,680 were killed — with Aboriginal fatalities alone comprising no less than 65,180.<ref name="ReferenceA">Evans, Raymond & Ørsted–Jensen, Robert: 'I Cannot Say the Numbers that Were Killed': Assessing Violent Mortality on the Queensland Frontier" (paper at AHA 9 July 2014 at University of Queensland) publisher Social Science Research Network</ref> Of these deaths, around 24,000 Aboriginal men, women and children were killed by the Native Police between 1859 and 1897.<ref>R Evans, quoted in T Bottoms (2013) ''Conspiracy of Silence: Queensland's Frontier Killing Times'', Allen & Unwin, p.181</ref>

The military force of the Queensland Government in this war was the [[Australian native police|Native Police]], who operated from 1849 to the 1920s. The Native Police was a body of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander troopers that operated under the command of white officers. The Native Police were often recruited forcefully from far-away communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/frontier/stories/ep3.htm |title=Episode Three |work=Frontier |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=4 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718191740/https://www.abc.net.au/frontier/stories/ep3.htm |archive-date=18 July 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=29 May 2023 |title=Frontier wars |url=https://www.qld.gov.au/recreation/arts/heritage/archives/collection/war/frontier-wars |access-date=2023-08-27 |website=Queensland Government |language=en |archive-date=27 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230827144736/https://www.qld.gov.au/recreation/arts/heritage/archives/collection/war/frontier-wars |url-status=live }}</ref> 
[[File:Wills_Tragedy_1861.jpg|thumb|Aftermath of the 1861 [[Cullin-La-Ringo massacre]] in which 19 settlers were killed by Aboriginal people, the deadliest attack on settlers in the frontier wars]]
Conflict spread quickly with free settlement in 1838, with settlement rapidly expanding in a great rush to take up the surrounding land in the [[Darling Downs]], Logan and Brisbane Valley and South Burnett onwards from 1840, in many cases leading to widespread fighting and heavy loss of life. The conflict later spread north to the [[Wide Bay–Burnett|Wide Bay]] and [[Burnett River]] and [[Hervey Bay]] region, and at one stage the settlement of [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]] was virtually under siege.{{Sfnp|Broome|1988|p=102}}

The largest reasonably well-documented massacres in southeast Queensland were the [[Kilcoy, Queensland|Kilcoy]] and [[Whiteside, Queensland|Whiteside]] poisonings, each of which was said to have taken up to 70 Aboriginal lives by use of a gift of flour laced with [[strychnine]].

=== Slavery ===
{{Further information|Blackbirding#Queensland}}
Tens of thousands of [[South Sea Islanders]] were kidnapped from islands nearby to Australia and sold as slaves to work on the colony's agricultural plantations through a process known as [[blackbirding]].

This trade in what were then known as [[Kanaka (Pacific Island worker)|Kanakas]] was in operation from 1863 to 1908, a period of 45 years. Some 55,000 to 62,500 were brought to Australia,<ref name="AHRC">Tracey Flanagan, Meredith Wilkie, and Susanna Iuliano.

In 1865, the first rail line in the state opened between [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] and [[Grandchester]]. Queensland's economy expanded rapidly in 1867 after James Nash discovered gold on the [[Mary River (Queensland)|Mary River]] near the town of [[Gympie]], sparking a gold rush and saving the State of Queensland from near economic collapse. While still significant, they were on a much smaller scale than the gold rushes of Victoria and New South Wales.

Immigration to Australia and Queensland, in particular, began in the 1850s to support the state economy. During the period from the 1860s until the early 20th century, many labourers, known at the time as [[Kanakas]], were brought to Queensland from neighbouring Pacific Island nations to work in the state's sugar cane fields. Some of these people had been kidnapped under a process known as [[blackbirding]] or press-ganging, and their employment conditions constituted an allegedly exploitative form of indentured labour. [[Italian Australians|Italian immigrants]] entered the sugar cane industry from the 1890s.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Rickard|title=Australia: A Cultural History|year=2017|pages=173|publisher=Monash University |isbn=978-1-921867-60-6}}</ref>

During the 1890s, the six Australian colonies, including Queensland, held a series of referendums which culminated in the [[Federation of Australia]] on 1 January 1901. During this time, Queensland had a population of half a million people. Since then, Queensland has remained a [[federated state]] within Australia, and its population has significantly grown.

Australia's first major airline, [[Qantas]] (originally standing for "Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services"), was founded in [[Winton, Queensland|Winton]] in 1920 to serve outback Queensland.

In 1922 Queensland abolished the [[Queensland Legislative Council]], becoming the only Australian state with a [[unicameral legislature|unicameral]] [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|parliament]].

In 1935 [[Cane toads in Australia|cane toad]]s were deliberately introduced to Queensland from Hawaii in an unsuccessful attempt to reduce the number of French's cane and greyback [[cane beetle]]s that were destroying the roots of sugar cane plants, which are integral to Queensland's economy. The toads have remained an environmental pest since that time. In 1962, the first commercial production of oil in Queensland and Australia began at [[Moonie, Queensland|Moonie]].

During [[World War II]] Brisbane became central to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] campaign when the AMP Building (now called [[MacArthur Central]]) was used as the [[South West Pacific Area (command)#Command|South West Pacific headquarters]] for [[Douglas MacArthur|General Douglas MacArthur]], chief of the Allied Pacific forces, until his headquarters were moved to [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] in August 1944.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://home.st.net.au/~dunn/ausarmy/hiringsno1lofc.htm|title=Hirings Section|publisher=Australia @ War|author=Peter Dunn|date=2 March 2005|access-date=7 January 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012165321/https://home.st.net.au/~dunn/ausarmy/hiringsno1lofc.htm|archive-date=12 October 2007}}</ref> In 1942, during the war, Brisbane was the site of a violent clash between visiting US military personnel and Australian servicemen and civilians, which resulted in one death and hundreds of injuries.

The end of World War II saw a [[Post-war immigration to Australia|wave of immigration]] from across Europe, with many more immigrants coming from [[Southern Europe|southern]] and [[Eastern Europe|eastern]] Europe than in previous decades.

In the later decades of the 20th century, the [[subtropical climate|humid subtropical climate]]—regulated by the availability of air conditioning—saw Queensland become a popular destination for migrants from interstate.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bigger Or Better?: Australia's Population Debate|last=Lowe|first=Ian|year=2012|publisher=[[University of Queensland]] Press|isbn= 9780702248078}}</ref> Since that time, Queensland has continuously seen high levels of migration from the other states and territories of Australia.

With a total area of 1,729,742 square kilometres (715,309 square miles), Queensland is an expansive state with a highly diverse range of climates and geographical features. If Queensland were an independent nation, it would be the world's 16th largest.

Queensland's eastern coastline borders the [[Coral Sea]], an arm of the Pacific Ocean. The state is bordered by the [[Torres Strait]] to the north, with [[Boigu Island (Queensland)|Boigu Island]] off the coast of [[New Guinea]] representing the northern extreme of its territory. The triangular [[Cape York Peninsula]], which points toward New Guinea, is the northernmost part of the state's mainland. West of the peninsula's tip, northern Queensland is bordered by the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. To the west, Queensland is bordered by the [[Northern Territory]], at the [[138th meridian east]], and to the southwest by northeastern [[South Australia]]. The state's southern border with New South Wales is constituted in the east by the [[drainage divide|watershed]] from [[Point Danger (Tweed Heads)|Point Danger]] to the [[Dumaresq River]], and the Dumaresq, [[Macintyre River|Macintyre]] and [[Barwon River (New South Wales)|Barwon]] rivers. The west of the southern border is defined by the [[29th parallel south]] (including some minor [[Queensland and New South Wales boundary encroachments|historical encroachments]]) until it reaches South Australia.

Like much of eastern Australia, the [[Great Dividing Range]] runs roughly parallel with, and inland from, the coast, and areas west of the range are more arid than the humid coastal regions. The [[Great Barrier Reef]], which is the world's largest [[coral reef]] system, runs parallel to the state's [[Coral Sea]] coast between the [[Torres Strait]] and [[K'gari (Fraser Island)]]. Queensland's coastline includes the world's three largest sand islands: [[K'gari (Fraser Island)]], [[Moreton Island|Moreton]], and [[North Stradbroke Island|North Stradbroke]].

The state contains six [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]]-listed preservation areas: the Great Barrier Reef along the Coral Sea coast, K'gari (Fraser Island) on the [[Wide Bay–Burnett]] region's coastline, the [[Wet Tropics of Queensland|wet tropics]] in [[Far North Queensland]] including the [[Daintree Rainforest]], [[Lamington National Park]] in [[South East Queensland]], the [[Australian Fossil Mammal Sites (Riversleigh)|Riversleigh fossil sites]] in [[Gulf Country|North West Queensland]], and the [[Gondwana Rainforests]] in South East Queensland.

The state is divided into several [[Regions of Queensland|unofficial regions]] which are commonly used to refer to large areas of the state's vast geography. These include:
* '''[[South East Queensland]]''' in the state's coastal extreme south-eastern corner, an urban region which includes the state's three largest cities: capital city Brisbane and popular coastal tourist destinations the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] and [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]]. In some definitions, it also includes the city of [[Toowoomba, Queensland|Toowoomba]]. South East Queensland accounts for more than 70% of the state's population.
* The '''[[Darling Downs]]''' in the state's inland southeast, which consists of fertile agricultural (particularly cattle grazing) land and in some definitions includes the city of Toowoomba. The region also includes the mountainous [[Granite Belt]], the state's coldest region which occasionally experiences snow.
* '''[[Wide Bay–Burnett]]''' in the state's coastal southeast, to the north of the South East Queensland region. It is rich in [[sugar cane]] farms and includes the cities of [[Bundaberg]], [[Hervey Bay]] as well as [[K'gari (Fraser Island)]], the world's largest sand island.
* '''[[Central Queensland]]''' on the state's central coastline, which is dominated by cattle farmland and coal mining. It contains the [[Capricorn Coast]] and [[Whitsunday Islands]] tourist regions, as well as the cities of [[Rockhampton]] and [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]].
* '''[[North Queensland]]''' on the state's northern coastline, which is dominated by cattle farmland and mining and which includes the city of [[Townsville]].
* '''[[Far North Queensland]]''' on the state's extreme northern coastline along the [[Cape York Peninsula]], which includes [[tropical rainforest]], the state's highest mountain, [[Mount Bartle Frere]], the [[Atherton Tablelands]] pastoral region (dominated by [[sugar cane]] and [[tropical fruit]]s), the most visited section of the [[Great Barrier Reef]], as well as the city of [[Cairns, Queensland|Cairns]].
* '''[[South West Queensland]]''' in the state's inland south-west, which is a primarily agricultural region dominated by cattle farmland, and which includes the [[Channel Country]] region of [[braided river|intertwining rivulets]].
* '''[[Central West Queensland]]''' in the state's inland central-west, dominated by cattle farmland and which includes the city of [[Longreach, Queensland|Longreach]].
* The '''[[Gulf Country]]''' (also known as North West Queensland), in the state's inland north-west along the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], which is dominated by [[savanna]] and mining and includes the [[city of Mount Isa]].

===Climate===
[[File:Queensland Köppen.svg|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] in Queensland]]

Because of its size, there is significant variation in climate across the state. There is ample rainfall along the coastline, with a [[monsoon]]al wet season in the [[Tropical climate|tropical]] north, and [[Humid subtropical climate|humid sub-tropical]] conditions along the southern coastline. Low rainfall and hot humid summers are typical for the inland and west. Elevated areas in the south-eastern inland can experience temperatures well below freezing in mid-winter providing [[frost]] and, rarely, [[snowfall]]. The climate of the coastal regions is influenced by warm ocean waters, keeping the region free from extremes of temperature and providing moisture for rainfall.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Climate Centre|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/ausclim/ausclimqld.htm|title= Climate of Queensland|publisher=Bureau of Meteorology|access-date=4 August 2010|archive-url=https://webarchive.nla.gov.au/awa/20090317054300/https://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/ausclim/ausclimqld.html|archive-date=17 March 2009}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

In December 2021, Queensland had an estimated population of 5,265,043.<ref name=ABSPop /> Approximately half of the state's population lives in Brisbane, and over 70% live in [[South East Queensland]]. Nonetheless, Queensland is the second most decentralised state in Australia after [[Tasmania]]. Since the 1980s, Queensland has consistently been the fastest-growing state in Australia, as it receives high levels of both international immigration and migration from interstate. There have however been short periods where [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]] have grown faster.

One of the six founding [[States and territories of Australia|states of Australia]], Queensland has been a [[federated state]] subject to the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] since 1 January 1901. It may legislate on all matters not [[Section 51 of the Constitution of Australia|ceded in the Australian Constitution to the federal government]]. It is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[constitutional monarchy]]. The [[Constitution of Queensland]] sets out the operation of the state's government. The state's constitution contains several [[entrenched clause|entrenched provisions]] which cannot be changed in the absence of a [[referendum]]. There is also a [[Statutory law|statutory]] [[charter of rights]], the ''Queensland Human Rights Act 2019''. Queensland's system of government is influenced by the [[Westminster system]] and [[Politics of Australia|Australia's federal system of government]].

The government power [[Separation of powers in Australia|can be divided]] into three groups:
* Legislature: the [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Parliament of Queensland]], comprising the [[Legislative Assembly of Queensland|Legislative Assembly]] and the [[Monarchy of Australia|Monarch]] (represented by the [[Governor of Queensland|Governor]]);
* Executive: the [[Queensland Government]], which consists of the [[Executive Council of Queensland]], which formalises decisions of the [[Cabinet of Queensland]], which is composed of the [[Premier of Queensland|Premier]] and other ministers of state appointed by the Governor on the advice of the premier;
* Judiciary: the [[Supreme Court of Queensland|Supreme Court]] and other state courts, whose judges are appointed by the Governor on the advice of Parliament.

[[Executive (government)|Executive authority]] is nominally vested in the [[Governor of Queensland]] (currently [[Jeannette Young]]) who represents and is appointed by the [[Monarchy of Australia|Monarch]] (currently [[Charles III]]) on the advice of the [[Premier of Queensland]]. The Premier, who is the state's [[Head of government]], along with the [[Cabinet of Queensland]] (whose decisions are formalised by the [[Executive Council of Queensland|Executive Council]]), exercise executive authority in practice. The Premier is appointed by the Governor and [[Responsible government|must have support]] of the [[Legislative Assembly of Queensland]]. The Premier is in practice a leading member of the Legislative Assembly and parliamentary leader of his or her political party, or coalition of parties, and members of the Cabinet will be drawn from the same party or coalition. The current Premier and [[Deputy Premier of Queensland|Deputy Premier]] are [[David Crisafulli]] and [[Jarrod Bleijie]] of the [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National Party]] respectively. [[Government House, Brisbane|Government House]] at [[Paddington, Queensland|Paddington]] in Brisbane is the seat of the Governor, having replaced [[Old Government House, Queensland|Old Government House]] at [[Gardens Point, Brisbane|Gardens Point]] in Brisbane's [[Brisbane central business district|CBD]] in the early 20th century. The executive branch is simply referred to as the [[Queensland Government]].

[[Legislature|Legislative authority]] is exercised by the [[Parliament of Queensland|Queensland Parliament]] which uniquely for Australian states is [[unicameralism|unicameral]], containing only one house, the Legislative Assembly. The Parliament was [[bicameral legislature|bicameral]] until 1922 when the [[Queensland Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] was abolished by the Labor "suicide squad", so called because they were appointed for the purpose of voting to abolish their own offices.<ref name="apg">{{cite book |title=Australian Politics and Government: The Commonwealth, the States, and Territories |last=Wanna |first=John |editor-last=Moon |editor2-first=Jeremy |editor2-last=Sharman |editor-first=Campbell |chapter=Queensland |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |isbn=978-0-521-82507-8 |page=47 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37Sel9HEYgUC |access-date=15 November 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102073504/https://books.google.com/books?id=37Sel9HEYgUC |archive-date=2 January 2016}}</ref> [[Bill (law)|Bills]] receive [[royal assent]] from the [[Governor of Queensland|Governor]] before being passed into law. The Parliament's seat is at [[Parliament House, Brisbane|Parliament House]] at [[Gardens Point, Brisbane|Gardens Point]] in Brisbane's CBD. Members of the Legislative Assembly represent [[Electoral districts of Queensland|93 electoral districts]]. Elections in Queensland are held at the end of each fixed four-year parliamentary term and are determined by [[instant-runoff voting]].

The state's [[judiciary]] consists of the [[Supreme Court of Queensland]] and the [[District Court of Queensland]], established by the Queensland Constitution, as well as the [[Magistrates Court of Queensland]] and other courts and tribunals established by legislation. Cases may be appealed to the [[High Court of Australia]]. As with all Australian states and territories, Queensland has a [[common law]] legal system. The Supreme and District courts are headquartered at the [[Queen Elizabeth II Courts of Law, Brisbane|Queen Elizabeth II Courts of Law]] in Brisbane's CBD.

This tendency was exemplified by the government of the state's longest-serving Premier [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]].
