Located in Kagawa's capital city, Takamatsu, the mountain of [[Yashima, Kagawa|Yashima]] was the [[Battle of Yashima|battlefield]] for one of the best-known struggles between the [[Heike clan|Heike]] and [[Genji clan|Genji]] clans.

===Mergers===
{{Main|List of mergers in Kagawa Prefecture}}

== Economy ==

Kagawa has a nominal GDP of approximately 3,802 billion yen.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kagawa Regional Information - Investing In...|url=https://www.jetro.go.jp/en/invest/region/data/kagawa.html|access-date=September 21, 2021|website=Japan External Trade Organization}}</ref> Kagawa's major export industries, in order of export value, include transportation equipment, electrical equipment, chemical products, general machinery, mineral fuels, manufactured goods, raw materials, and foodstuff.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=日 本 貿 易 振 興 機 構 （ J E T R O ）|last2=香 川 貿 易 情 報 セ ン タ ー|date=March 2020|title=香川県貿易実態調査 2020 年（令和 2 年）3 月|url=https://www.jetro.go.jp/ext_images/jetro/japan/kagawa/data/survey2018.pdf|journal=香川県貿易実態調査|pages=155}}</ref>

== Foods ==
[[File:Sanukiudon-gyouretsu 01.JPG|thumb|right|People queuing for udon in Kagawa|202x202px]]

[[Sanuki udon]] (a type of udon noodle) is the most famous local food of Kagawa Prefecture. In 2008, there were over 700 udon restaurants in this prefecture alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zipan-go.jp/shikoku/kagawa|title=Kagawa 香川|date=2017|website=Zipango|access-date=October 24, 2019|archive-date=October 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191024235944/https://www.zipan-go.jp/shikoku/kagawa|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Aside from udon, Kagawa is also famous for "''hone-tsuki-dori''", seasoned chicken thigh cooked on the bone. Originating from [[Marugame, Kagawa|Marugame City]], the dish has now become a popular dish in ''izakaya'' restaurants across the country.

Olives and olive-related products have also come to be recognized as Kagawa foods. As the first place in Japan to successfully cultivate olives, Kagawa has been producing olive-related products since 1908. As well as winning both domestic and international awards for the quality of its olive oil, Kagawa has also created two offshoot food brands from its olive industry - "olive beef" and "olive yellowtail". Waste organic matter from olive pressing is used as feed for cattle and the [[Yellowtail amberjack|Yellowtail Amberjack]]. Due to the high amount of polyphenols in the olive waste, the flesh of the respective meats does not oxidize or lose color easily.

Other local specialties include ''[[wasanbon]]'' sugar sweets, ''[[sōmen]]'' noodles and ''shōyu'' soy sauce.
[[Rare sugar]] researches are thriving and have discovered mass production culture enzymes. [[:jp:D-タガトース 3-エピメラーゼ|D-tagatose 3-epimerase]] is an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible epimerization reaction of the 3rd carbon of ketose.

== Demographics ==
[[File:Kagawa prefecture population pyramid 2020.svg|thumb|Kagawa prefecture population pyramid 2020]]
