Appleton and Company}}</ref> is the seat of government and the capital city of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and of the [[provinces of Spain|province]] of [[Álava]] in northern [[Spain]]. It holds the autonomous community's [[Basque Parliament|House of Parliament]], the headquarters of the Government, and the [[Lehendakari|Lehendakari's (Prime Minister's)]] official residency. The municipality—which comprises not only the city but also the mainly agricultural lands of 63 villages around—is the largest in the Basque Country, with a total area of {{Convert|276.81|km2|sqmi}}, and it has a population of 253,093 (January 2021). The dwellers of Vitoria-Gasteiz are called ''vitorianos'' or ''gasteiztarrak'', while traditionally they are dubbed ''babazorros'' ([[Basque language|Basque]] for 'bean sacks').

Vitoria-Gasteiz is a dynamic city with strengths in [[healthcare]], [[aeronautics]], the [[automotive industry]], and [[viticulture]]. It is consistently ranked as one of the 5 best places to live in Spain, ranking highly in [[quality of life]] and [[employment|business opportunities]], it is the first Spanish municipality to be awarded the title of [[European Green Capital Award|European Green Capital]] (in 2012) and it has been also recognized by the UN with the Global Green City Award (in 2019). The old town has some of the best preserved medieval streets and plazas in the region and it is one of very few cities with two cathedrals. The city also holds well known festivals such as the [[Azkena rock festival]], [[FesTVal]], [[Vitoria-Gasteiz jazz festival]], and the [[Virgen Blanca Festivities]].

Vitoria-Gasteiz's vicinity is home to acclaimed wineries such as Ysios, designed by world-renowned architect [[Santiago Calatrava]], and [[Marqués de Riscal Hotel|Marqués de Riscal]], by [[Frank Gehry]]. Relevant heritage sites including the Neolithic remains of [[:eu:Aizkomendiko trikuharria|Aizkomendi]], [[Salvatierra/Agurain|Sorginetxe]] and [[La chabola de la Hechicera]]; Iron Age remains such as the settlements of Lastra and Buradón; antique remains such as the settlement of [[La Hoya, Alava|La Hoya]] and the salt valley of [[Añana]]; and several medieval fortresses including the [[Tower of Mendoza]] and the [[Tower of Villañañe|Tower of Varona]].

[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] dedicated his Opus 91, often called the "[[Battle of Vitoria]]" or "[[Wellington's Victory]]", to one of the most famous events of the Napoleonic Wars: the [[Battle of Vitoria]], in which a Spanish, Portuguese and British army under the command of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|General the Duke of Wellington]] broke the French army and nearly captured the puppet king [[Joseph Bonaparte]]. It was a pivotal point in the [[Peninsular War]], and a precursor to the expulsion of the French army from Spain. A memorial statue can be seen today in [[Virgen Blanca Square]].

== Name ==
The official name of Vitoria-Gasteiz is a compound name of its traditional names in {{llink|es}} and {{llink|eu}}, respectively. By inhabitants, it is still generally referred to as either ''Vitoria'' or ''Gasteiz'', depending on the language spoken. More rarely, it may be referred to by Basque speakers as ''Vitorixe'', a Basque form of the Spanish name.

== History ==
[[File:GasteizXVII.jpg|thumb|left|Vitoria-Gasteiz in the 17th century]]
In 581 AD, the [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] king [[Liuvigild]] founded the city of Victoriacum, trying to emulate the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] foundations, as a celebration of the victory against the [[Vascones]] near what is assumed to be the hill occupied by the primitive village of Gasteiz. This however is not sufficiently proven, and some historians and experts believe that Victoriacum was located not on the site of present-day Vitoria-Gasteiz but nearby. Several possible locations have been proposed, the foremost of which is the late Roman military camp of [[Iruña-Veleia]] (cf. J. M. Lacarra). Veleia is located some 11&nbsp;km north of modern Vitoria, on the banks of the same river. However, modern archeological studies of the site suggest that Veleia was last inhabited {{Circa|5th century AD}}, and archeologists are still to find a 6th-century Visigothic resettlement in the site.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u-X4dkALGsAC&q=Victoriacum|title=Leovigildo: unidad y diversidad de un reinado|first1=Luis A. García|last1=Moreno|first2=Luis Suárez|last2=Fernández|date=10 March 2018|publisher=Real Academia de la Historia|isbn=9788496849402|via=Google Books}}</ref> Another theory has suggested that Victoriacum was located at the foot of Mount [[Gorbea]] where there is a village called [[Vitoriano]]. The town of [[Armentia]], nowadays in the outskirts of Vitoria, has also been proposed as a possible location of Victoriacum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/98647|title = Nova Victoria - Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia}}</ref> In either case, Victoriacum vanishes from history shortly after its foundation.<ref name="books.google.co.uk">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u-X4dkALGsAC&q=Victoriaco&pg=PA148|title=Leovigildo: unidad y diversidad de un reinado|first1=Luis A.

In 1181, Sancho the Wise, [[King of Navarre]] founded the town of ''Nova Victoria'' as a defensive outpost on top of a hill at the site of the previous settlement of Gasteiz. The existence of ''Gastehiz'', apparently inhabited by Vasconic people,<ref>S. Villimer: ''Vitoria, historia de una ciudad'', p. 160 (Vitoria 1977).</ref> can be traced back to the Middle Ages; it is certain that by the 11th century, prior to the foundation of ''Nova Victoria'', the settlement was already walled. It is assumed that Sancho the Wise gave the new city its name in memory of the old settlement of Victoriacum, which must had long since been abandoned.<ref name="books.google.co.uk"/> In 1199, the town was besieged for nine months and eventually captured by the troops of [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]], who annexed the town to the [[Kingdom of Castile]]. The town was progressively enlarged and in 1431 it was granted a city [[Municipal charter|charter]] by [[John II of Castile|King Juan II]] of Castile. In 1463, it was one of the five founding ''villas'' of the Brotherhood of Álava alongside [[List of municipalities in La Rioja|Sajazarra]], [[Miranda de Ebro]], [[Pancorbo]] and [[Salvatierra/Agurain]].

[[File:George Jones (1786-1869) - The Battle of Vittoria - RCIN 407186 - Royal Collection.jpg|thumb|''[[The Battle of Vittoria (painting)|The Battle of Vittoria]]'' by [[George Jones (painter)|George Jones]] depicting the 1813 battle.]]
The [[Battle of Vitoria]] of the [[Peninsular War]] occurred near Vitoria-Gasteiz along the river [[Zadorra]] on 21 June 1813. An allied British, Portuguese, and Spanish army under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|General the Marquess of Wellington]] broke the French army under [[Joseph Bonaparte]] and Marshal [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]]. The victory assured the eventual end of French control in Spain. There is a monument commemorating this battle in the main square of the city known as the Monument to Independence.

When news came to Vienna in late July of that year, [[Johann Nepomuk Mälzel]] commissioned [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] to compose a symphony, the op. 91 [[Wellington's Victory|Wellingtons Sieg oder die Schlacht bei Vittoria]] (Wellington's Victory, or the Battle of Vitoria) or ''Siegessymphonie''.

Work began on the Institute for Middle Education in 1843, with classes beginning during the 1853–54 academic year. It is now current headquarters of the [[Basque Parliament]] and formerly the convent of Santa Clara. The Free University opened in the wake of the revolution of 1868. The university operated from 1869, to just prior to the 1873–1874 term, largely because of the [[Third Carlist War|second Carlist War]]. Some of its most notable academics were Ricardo Becerro de Bengoa, Julián Apraiz and [[Federico Baraibar]]. The latter was also among the first teachers of Basque in Vitoria-Gasteiz as an off-[[syllabus]] subject.

===Spanish Civil War===
At the start of the [[Spanish Civil War]] Álava and Vitoria were easily captured by the rebel [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] led by General Angel García Benítez, assisted by Colonel [[Camilo Alonso Vega]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Hugh |title=The Spanish Civil War |date=2012 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-141-01161-5 |page=226 |edition=50th Anniversary}}</ref> Vitoria was captured on 19 July 1936.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Beevor |first1=Antony |title=The Battle for Spain |date=2006 |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |location=London |isbn=978-0-7538-2165-7 |page=72}}</ref> In November 1936 an attempt by [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]] to retake Vitoria was thwarted after being spotted by Nationalist reconnaissance aircraft.<ref>Beevor (2006) p.251</ref> The 1937 Nationalist campaign in [[Biscay|Vizcaya]] was supported by 80 German aircraft based at Vitoria,<ref>Thomas (2012) p.596</ref> where the [[Condor Legion]] fighter wing was concentrated.<ref>Beevor (2006) p.253</ref>

===Transition to democracy===
During the [[Spanish transition to democracy]], the Church of St. Francis of Assisi was the scene of a [[Massacre of 3rd of March in Vitoria|police shooting on March 3, 1976]] during a peaceful labour assembly. Under the orders of Interior Minister [[Manuel Fraga]], the police shot tear-gas into the church where 5,000 demonstrators and others had met, firing on them as they struggled their way out of the building. It resulted in five dead and over one hundred wounded by gunshot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://catalogo.artium.org/dossieres/4/fotoperiodismo-la-realidad-captada-por-el-objetivo/fotografias-con-historia/masacre-del- |title=Masacre del 3 de marzo en Vitoria-Gasteiz (1976) |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2010 |website=Artium |access-date=2016-07-14 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Malaina|first=Guillermo|date=2008-02-13|title=Los fantasmas de Fraga|url=http://www.publico.es/espana/fantasmas-fraga.html|newspaper=Público|access-date=2016-07-15}}</ref>

On 20 May 1980, by decision of the Basque Parliament, Vitoria-Gasteiz became the place of the common institutions of the [[Basque Autonomous Community]].

===Judizmendi===
[[File:Convivencia by Yael Artsi .jpg|thumb|"Coexistence" by Yael Artsi.]]
Historically, there once was a [[Jewish]] community living in Vitoria, before the [[Expulsion of the Jews from Spain|expulsion of the Jews]]. In 1492, the year of the expulsion, the town council agreed to maintain and respect the Jewish cemetery, which became known as Judimendi, or "mountain of the Jews" in [[Basque language|Basque]]. Over time, linguistically, "Judimendi" became "Judizmendi." Unique to anywhere else in Spain, the town maintained this agreement from 1492-1952, when the town undertook plans to convert Judizmendi to a public garden. The Jewish community in [[Bayonne]] heard about these plans, and convinced the city government of Vitoria-Gasteiz to commemorate the memory of the cemetery.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vitoria |url=https://jguideeurope.org/en/region/spain/basque-country/vitoria/ |website=JGuide Europe |access-date=25 June 2024}}</ref> In 2004, Israeli artist Yaël Artsi created the monument "Coexistence" to be displayed at Judizmendi.

In 2017, the monument was vandalized with anti-semitic graffiti twice: once in April, and once in May.<ref>{{citation |journal=Observatorio Antisemitismo |title=INFORME SOBRE EL ANTISEMITISMO EN ESPAÑA 2017-2018 |issue=2017–2018 |page=11 |url=https://archive.jpr.org.uk/download?id=8788 |access-date=25 June 2024}}</ref>

In 2019, the Basque Jewish community held a ceremony to pay tribute to the city for honoring its promise to the Jews.<ref>{{cite web |title=La comunidad judía de Euskadi homenajeará a Vitoria-Gasteiz por cumplir su promesa hace 526 años de cuidar su antiguo cementerio |url=https://blogs.vitoria-gasteiz.org/medios/2019/01/30/la-comunidad-judia-de-euskadi-homenajeara-a-vitoria-gasteiz-por-cumplir-su-promesa-hace-526-anos-de-cuidar-su-antiguo-cementerio/ |website=Vitoria-Gasteiz.org |access-date=25 June 2024}}</ref>

== Climate ==
Vitoria-Gasteiz has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Cfb''). Winters are much cooler than in lowland coastal areas, whilst summers are similar in terms of high temperatures, with cool nights due to the elevation. Summers show a significant influence of [[mediterranean climate|mediterranean]] precipitation patterns, but enough precipitation usually occurs to remain marine in nature. Sunshine levels are low by Spanish standards and the climate is humid year-round.

From an urban point of view, Vitoria-Gasteiz is a mid-sized city, the line of which is adapted to the traditions of each historical moment. The medieval town is set in almond-shape around the hill foundation, which by its privileged position as the only elevation in the plain of Álava, became a defensive stronghold coveted by the kingdoms of Navarre and Castilla during the 11th and 12th centuries. The walled enclosure was built prior to the war between Castile and Navarre in the 11th century to defend the village. The defensive walls of old Gasteiz were built between the years 1050 and 1100. Because of that first defensive role, its narrow streets surrounding the oval resulted in compact rows of houses parallel both to each other and the medieval walls (of which only some sections and gates are preserved). Between the years 1854 and 1856, an epidemic of cholera served as the excuse for tearing down the gates, fortresses which provided access to the streets Run (fort of Nanclares), Shoe (fort of Soto) and Blacksmith (fort of Abendaño) and which served to protect every neighbourhood association. The entrance of the current ''Plaza de la Virgen Blanca'' was the site of Santa Clara, which was joined by the wall at the Convent of San Antonio. In the 19th century, in recognition that the city was small, an expansion was planned in the neoclassical style, and little by little planning for the city has given Vitoria-Gasteiz its current form.

The Old Quarter (''Alde Zaharra''/''Casco Viejo''), has many architectural jewels such as Bendaña Palace, the Fournier Museum of cards (erected in 1525 by Juan Lopez de Arrieta, on the site occupied before by the defensive tower built by Maeztu). The Ezkoriatza-Eskibel Palace, built by Claudio de Arciniega in the 15th century. The Villa Suso, where Martin Salinas, ambassador of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] dwelt (16th century). And the greatest historical treasure of Vitoria-Gasteiz: the Cathedral of Santa Maria (Old Cathedral).

The history of the Cathedral of Santa María (commonly known as ''Old Cathedral''), is itself a synthesis of the history of Vitoria-Gasteiz. Built on the cemetery of the primitive village of Gasteiz (which today can be accessed through the excavations), the church of Santa María collapsed with the fire of 1202 and [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] (who had conquered the city just 2 years earlier), ordered that it be rebuilt on the site of a former church. It was now to serve two very different purposes: regular religious services and weapon storage. Thus was born the Cathedral of Santa Maria, a fortress-like church that served as the entrance to the city. The project changed with the centuries, so that each modification was made without taking into account the previous. This was the case in the 15th century (when the church became collegiate), and finally in the 1960s, when it was decided to reverse the previous works of strengthening of the external walls and widen the windows, made purely for aesthetic reasons, which had severely damaged the stability of the building. Today, the cathedral is open again, and offers visitors guided trips exposing the recent archaeological findings. It has become one of the main attractions of Vitoria-Gasteiz. Ken Follett, author of "The Pillars of the Earth", said after his stay in the city that Santa Maria was one of the three most interesting cathedrals of the world.{{citation needed|date=November 2008}}

From the Middle Ages to the 18th century, the population of Vitoria-Gasteiz and the layout of its streets remained almost unchanged. And it was not until the late 18th century, when growth required the expansion of the city outside. To solve the problem of the difference in height between the original kernel on the hill, and the plain below, the arches were erected and the Plaza De España or Plaza Nueva was built, which soften the transition from the old city to the 19th century neoclassical expansion of wide streets and gardens, the greatest examples of which are seen in the [[La Florida (park)|''La Florida'' Park]], and the ''Andre Maria Zuriaren Enparantza/Plaza de la Virgen Blanca'', with its façade pulled viewpoints.

Finally, the new quarters of Vitoria-Gasteiz were built, in accordance with a development plan favouring parks, recreation areas and quality of life. While aiming to maintain the identity of the city, and drawing on the district of San Martín, the need to accommodate the growing population has led the city to concentrate its growth in the new neighbourhoods of Lakua, Salburua and Zabalgan. The city of Vitoria-Gasteiz has received several international awards for its urban development. Also worth mentioning is the green ring, a network of parks and green spaces around the city, destined to be the lung of the future Vitoria-Gasteiz, and link the city with the countryside. This ring is formed of the parks Salburua, Zabalgana, Armentia, Alegria river, Gamarra, [[Abetxuko]] and Atxa-Landaberde.
