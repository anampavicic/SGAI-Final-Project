'''Mangalore''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|ŋ|ɡ|ə|l|ɔːr|,_|ˌ|m|æ|ŋ|ɡ|ə|ˈ|l|ɔː|r}} {{respell|MANG|gə|lor|,_-|LOR}}), officially known as '''Mangaluru'''<!-- ({{lang-tcy|ಕುಡ್ಲ|Kudla}}; {{lang-kn|ಮಂಗಳೂರು|Mangalūru}}; {{lang-ml|മംഗലാപുരം|Mangalapuram}}; {{lang-kok|ಕೊಡಿಯಾಲ್|Kodial}}; [[Beary bashe|Beary]]: {{script|Knda|ಮೈಕಾಲ}}, <small>romanized:</small> ''Maikala'')--> ({{IPA|kn|mɐŋɡɐɭuːru|lang}}), is a major industrial port city in the [[States and union territories of India|Indian state]] of [[Karnataka]] and on the west coast of [[India]]. It is located between the [[Laccadive Sea]] and the [[Western Ghats]] about {{cvt|352|km|mi|0}} west of [[Bangalore]], the [[Capital city|state capital]], 14&nbsp;km north of [[Karnataka]]–[[Kerala]] border and 297&nbsp;km south of [[Goa]]. Mangalore is the state's only city to have all four modes of transport—air, road, rail and sea. The population of the [[urban agglomeration]] was 619,664&nbsp;{{As of|alt=according to the 2011|2011}}&nbsp;national census of India. It is known for being one of the locations of the [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve (India)|Indian strategic petroleum reserves]].

The city developed as a port in the Laccadive Sea during ancient times, and after Independence a new [[New Mangalore Port|port]] was constructed in 1968 and has since become a major [[Ports in India|port of India]] that handles 75&nbsp;percent of India's coffee and cashew exports. It is also the country's seventh largest [[container port]]. Mangalore has been ruled by several major powers, including the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan empire]], [[Kadamba dynasty|Kadambas]], [[Alupas]], [[Vijayanagar Empire]], and [[Nayakas of Keladi|Keladi Nayaks]]. The city was a source of contention between the [[British Raj|British]] and the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] rulers [[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]], and was eventually annexed by the British in 1799. Mangalore remained part of the [[Madras Presidency]] until [[Partition of India|India's independence]] in 1947 and was unified with [[Mysore State]] (now called Karnataka) in 1956.

Mangalore is one of the fastest developing cities in [[India]]. The [[Dakshina Kannada]] district with its administrative headquarters at Mangalore has the highest Per Capita Income and Gross State Domestic Product in Karnataka, after Bangalore. Mangalore is a commercial, industrial, business, educational, healthcare, and startup hub. [[Mangalore City Corporation]] is responsible for the civic administration which manages the 60&nbsp;wards of the city. Its landscape is characterised by rolling hills, coconut palms, rivers, and hard laterite soil.

Mangalore is included as one of the cities in the [[Smart Cities Mission]] list and is among the 100&nbsp;smart cities to be developed in India. It has an average elevation of {{cvt|22|m|foot|0}} above [[mean sea level]]. It has a tropical monsoon climate and is under the influence of the southwest monsoon. It has its own [[Mangalore International Airport|International Airport]] which is around 15&nbsp;km from the city centre.
