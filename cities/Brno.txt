==Names==
The [[etymology]] of the name ''Brno'' is disputed. It might be derived from the [[History of the Czech language|Old Czech]] ''{{lang|cs|brnie}}'' 'muddy, swampy.'<ref>E.M. Pospelov, ''Geograficheskie nazvaniya mira'' (Moscow, 1998), p. 82.</ref> Alternative derivations are a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] verb ''brniti'' (to armour or to fortify) or a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]] spoken in the area before it was inhabited by [[Germanic peoples]] and later [[Slavic peoples]]. The latter theory would make it [[cognate]] with other Celtic words for hill, such as the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] word ''{{lang|cy|bryn}}''.

Throughout its history, Brno's locals also referred to the town in other languages, including ''{{lang|de|Brünn}}'' in German, ברין (''{{lang|yi-Latn|Brin}}'') in [[Yiddish]], and ''{{lang|la|Bruna}}'' in [[Latin]]. The city was also referred to as Brunn ({{IPAc-en|b|r|ʌ|n}})<ref>{{cite web |title =What does Brunn mean? |url= http://www.audioenglish.org/dictionary/brunn.htm |publisher =AudioEnglish.org |access-date= 26 October 2015 }}</ref> in English, but that usage is not common today.<ref>{{cite web |title= WordNet Search |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?o2=&o0=1&o8=1&o1=1&o7=&o5=&o9=&o6=&o3=&o4=&s=Brno |publisher= WordNet |access-date= 26 October 2015}}</ref>

The asteroid [[2889 Brno]] was named after the city, as was the [[Bren light machine gun]] (from ''Brno'' and ''[[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]]''), which was widely used in [[World War II]].

In the early 11th century Brno was established as a castle of a non-ruling prince from the [[House of Přemyslid]],<ref name="brnohist"/> and Brno became one of the centres of Moravia along with [[Olomouc]] and [[Znojmo]]. Brno was first mentioned in Cosmas' ''[[Chronica Boemorum]]'' dated to the year 1091, when Bohemian king [[Vratislaus II of Bohemia|Vratislaus II]] besieged his brother [[Conrad I, Duke of Bohemia|Conrad]] at Brno castle.<ref>{{cite book|last=Čapka|first=František|title=Morava|series=Stručná historie států|year=2003|publisher=Libri|location=Praha|language=cs|isbn=80-7277-186-8|page=30|chapter=Ota Olomoucký a Konrád Brněnský}}</ref>

[[File:Znak Moravského markrabství.png|thumb|left|upright|120px|Coat of arms of the margraviate]]
In the mid 11th century, Moravia was divided into three separate territories; each had its own ruler, coming from the [[Přemyslids]] dynasty, but independent of the other two, and subordinate only to the [[Bohemia]]n ruler in [[Prague]]. The seats of these rulers and thus the "capitals" of these territories were the castles and towns of Brno, [[Olomouc]], and [[Znojmo]]. In the late 12th century, Moravia began to reunify, forming the [[Margraviate of Moravia]]. From then until the mid of the 17th century, it was not clear which town should be the capital of Moravia. Political power was divided between Brno and Olomouc, but Znojmo also played an important role. The Moravian Diet, the Moravian Land Tables, and the Moravian Land Court were all seated in both cities at once.{{clarify|date=May 2019}} However, Brno was the official seat of the Moravian Margraves (rulers of Moravia),<ref name="spilberkhist"/> and later its geographical position closer to [[Vienna]] also became important. Otherwise, until 1642 Olomouc had a larger population than Brno, and was the seat of the only [[Roman Catholic]] [[diocese]] in Moravia.

[[File:Veduta z obléhání Brna Švédy v roce 1645.jpg|thumb|Unsuccessful Swedish siege in 1645]]

In 1243 the small settlement gouped together to form a fortified place  and Brno was granted city royal privileges{{clarify|date=December 2013}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brno history of the city |url=https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/-/media/files/schools/aad-lsa/00_brno-panels-all.pdf}}</ref> by the King, and was thus recognized as a royal city. As throughout Eastern Central Europe, the granting of city privileges was connected with [[Ostsiedlung|immigration from German-speaking lands]]. In 1324 Queen [[Elisabeth Richeza of Poland]] founded the [[Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady, Brno|Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady]], which now houses her grave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opatbrno.cz/opat_hist_en.htm|title=Opatství svatého Tomáše na Starém Brně|access-date=3 October 2011}}</ref> In the 14th century, Brno became one of the centres for the Moravian regional assemblies, whose meetings alternated between Brno and Olomouc.<ref name="brnohist"/> These assemblies made political, legal, and financial decisions. Brno and Olomouc were also the seats of the Land Court and the [[Moravian Land Tables]], thus they were the two most important cities in Moravia. From the mid 14th century to the early 15th century, Špilberk Castle had served as the permanent seat of the Margraves of Moravia; one of them was elected the [[King of the Romans]]. Brno was besieged in 1428 and again in 1430 by the [[Hussite]]s during the [[Hussite Wars]]. Both attempts to conquer the city failed.

===17th century===
[[File:Veduta Brna se znakem Markrabství moravského, rok 1670.jpg|thumb|upright|Coat of arms of the Margraviate of Moravia in ''Book of the state of lords'' with the picture of Brno (1670)]]
In 1641, during the [[Thirty Years' War]], the Holy Roman Emperor and Margrave of Moravia [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] ordered the permanent relocation of the diet, court, and the land tables from Olomouc to Brno, as Olomouc's [[Collegium Nordicum]] made it one of the primary targets of Swedish armies.<ref name="Garstein">{{cite book |title=Rome and the Counter-Reformation in Scandinavia: The age of Gustavus Adolphus and Queen Christina of Sweden, 1622–1656| first=Oskar|last=Garstein| publisher=BRILL|year=1992}}</ref> In 1642 Olomouc surrendered to the [[Swedish Army]], which occupied it for eight years.{{refn|This led to decline in population of Olomouc from over 30,000 people to mere 1,675 and total devastation of the city.|group="note"}} Meanwhile, Brno, as the only Moravian city which, under the leadership of [[Jean-Louis Raduit de Souches]], succeeded in defending itself from the Swedes under General [[Lennart Torstenson]] during the [[siege of Brno]] in 1645, served as the sole capital of the Margraviate of Moravia. After the end of the Thirty Years' War in 1648, Brno retained its status as the sole capital. This was later confirmed by the Holy Roman Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in 1782, and again in 1849 by the Moravian constitution.{{refn|However, Olomouc also had legal status of capital city, although this title was purely an honorary matter rather than a real role, sometimes it was referred to as "the Secondary Capital"<!-- CZ: "druhé hlavní město" -->.|group="note"}} Today, the Moravian Land Tables are stored in the [[Moravian Regional Archive]], and are included among the national cultural sights of the Czech Republic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/moravske-desky-zemske.aspx|title=Moravské desky zemské|publisher=Ministerstvo vnitra České republiky|access-date=3 October 2011|language=cs|archive-date=4 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004221923/http://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/moravske-desky-zemske.aspx|url-status=dead}}</ref>

During the 17th century [[Špilberk Castle]] was rebuilt as a huge baroque [[citadel]].<ref name="spilberkhist"/> Brno was besieged by the [[Prussian Army]] in 1742 under the leadership of [[Frederick the Great]], but the siege was ultimately unsuccessful. In 1777 the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Brno|bishopric of Brno]] was established by the [[Catholic Church]]; [[Mathias Franz Graf von Chorinsky Freiherr von Ledske]] was the first Bishop.<ref name="brnohist"/>{{refn|The cathedral of the bishopric of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Brno]], the [[Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul, Brno|Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul]], is depicted on the 10[[CZK]] coin.|group="note"}}

===19th century===
In December 1805 the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] was fought near the city; the battle is also known as the "Battle of the Three Emperors". Brno itself was not involved with the battle, but the French Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] spent several nights here at that time, and again in 1809.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brno.cz/turista-volny-cas/historie-mesta/historie-v-datech/|title=Brno – Historie v datech|access-date=28 September 2011|language=cs}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMBC6H_Napoleon_I_in_Moravias_capital_in_1809_Brno_Czech_Republic|title=Napoleon I. in Moravia's capital in 1809, Brno, Czech Republic - La Famille Bonaparte on Waymarking.com|access-date=28 September 2011}}</ref>

In 1839 the first train arrived in Brno from Vienna; this was the beginning of [[Rail transport in the Czech Republic|rail transport in what is now the Czech Republic]].<ref name="thefirsttrain"/> In the years 1859–1864 the city fortifications were almost completely removed. In 1869 a [[horsecar]] service started to operate in Brno, the first [[Tram|tram service]] in what would later become the Czech Republic.<ref name="dpmbhistory"/>

[[Gregor Mendel]] conducted his groundbreaking experiments in [[genetics]] while he was a monk at [[St. Thomas's Abbey, Brno|St. Thomas's Abbey]] in Brno in the 1850s.

Around 1900 Brno, which consisted in administrative terms only of the central city area until 1918, had a predominantly [[Moravian Germans|German-speaking population]] (63%), as opposed to the suburbs, which were predominantly Czech-speaking.<ref name="Bruna">{{cite web|url=http://www.bruenn.eu/de/de_u_cr1.html|title=Die Stadt Brünn – offizielle Webseiten der BRUNA über die Stadt Brünn|website=bruenn.eu}}</ref> Life in the city was therefore bilingual, and what was called in German "Brünnerisch" was a mixed idiom containing elements from both languages.<ref name="Bruna"/>

In 1919, after [[World War I]], two neighbouring towns, Královo Pole and Husovice, and 21 other municipalities were annexed to Brno, creating Greater Brno ({{langx|cs|Velké Brno}}). This was done to dilute the German-speaking majority of close to 55,000<ref name="Hahn"/> by the addition of the Czech communities of the city's neighborhood.

In 1921–1928, Brno was the capital of the administrative region of Land of Moravia (Czech: ''Země Moravská''). In 1928–1948, Brno was the capital of the Land of Moravia-Silesia (Czech: ''Země Moravskoslezská'').

In 1930, 200,000 inhabitants declared themselves to be of Czech, and some 52,000 of German nationality, in both cases including the respective Jewish citizens.<ref name="Hahn"/>

In 1960s and 1970s, large panel [[housing estate]]s were built in border districts, such as Bohunice, Líšeň, Bystrc and Vinohrady. During the communist era, most of the workforce was employed in industry, mainly machinery.

After 1989, part of the workforce switched from industry to services, and Brno became the IT centre of the Czech Republic. Nevertheless, new industrial zones were built at the edge of the city, such as Černovická terasa in the east of the city.

The city districts of Brno vary widely in their size by both population and area. The most populated city district of Brno is [[Brno-Centre]], which has over 91,000 residents, and the least populated are [[Brno-Ořešín]] and [[Brno-Útěchov]], with about 500 residents. By area, the largest district is [[Brno-Bystrc]] ({{convert|27.24|km²}}) and the smallest is [[Brno-Nový Lískovec]] ({{convert|1.66|km²}}).

==Economy==
Since 1990, many companies created or spun off as part of privatization from former national enterprises have disappeared.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ježek |first=Tomáš |date=1997 |title=The Czechoslovak Experience with Privatization |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24357627 |journal=Journal of International Affairs |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=477–488 |issn=0022-197X}}</ref> Before 1990, engineering companies were very important in Brno; since then, the city's economy has largely reoriented itself towards light industry, logistics, and services. The city later gained importance in other fields of [[engineering]], especially in [[software development]]. After 2000, foreign technology companies began establishing their branches in Brno, and many Czech companies with local or global reach were also founded here.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Slonkova |first=Eva |date=2022-11-24 |title=Brno Innovation Hub: Czech Republic’s Silicon Valley |url=https://therecursive.com/brno-innovation-hub/ |access-date=2024-11-01 |website=TheRecursive.com |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=admin |date=2021-10-07 |title=RICAIP {{!}} The Brno Technology Park - the Moravian Silicon Valley |url=https://ricaip.eu/robots-and-prince-charles-the-brno-technology-park-laid-the-foundations-of-the-moravian-silicon-valley/ |access-date=2024-11-01 |website=RICAIP |language=en-US}}</ref>

There are several legends connected with the City of Brno. One of the best known is the Legend of the Brno Dragon.<ref name="brnoinfo"/> According to this legend, a terrible creature was terrorizing the citizens of Brno. The people had never seen this animal before, so they called it a dragon. They lived in fear of the dragon until one citizen managed to kill the monster by tricking it into eating a carcass filled with lime. In reality the "dragon" was a crocodile, the preserved body of which is now displayed at the entrance of the [[Old Town Hall (Brno)|Old Town Hall]]. Crocodile and dragon motifs are common in Brno. A crocodile ({{langx|cs|krokodýl}}) is the local stuffed baguette, and the city radio station is known as Radio Krokodýl. One of the local [[baseball]] teams is named [[Draci Brno]] ({{langx|en|Brno Dragons}}) and the local rugby club is named [[RC Dragon Brno]]. There is also a local [[American football]] team called the [[Brno Alligators]]. An [[Inter-city rail|Intercity]] train connecting Brno and Prague is called ''Brněnský drak'' ({{langx|en|Brno dragon}}).

Next to the dragon at the Old Town Hall is the town's second well-known emblem, a wagon wheel made from a tree found and cut down 50 miles from the city. According to the legend, a local man made a wager that he could fell the tree, make a wheel out of it, and roll the wheel to the City of Brno, all within a single day. Since the achievement was deemed to be impossible by normal human means, the man was believed to have called on the devil for assistance, and died in poverty as a result.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.brno.cz/en/tourist-leisure/history/brno-tales/the-wheel-bet/ |title=Brno – the Wheel Bet |access-date=29 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802001559/http://www.brno.cz/en/tourist-leisure/history/brno-tales/the-wheel-bet |archive-date=2 August 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Another local legend relates to the siege of the city by Swedish forces in 1645. The locals and the Swedish army were in a stalemate, and the Swedish general declared that he would withdraw if his army had not won by noon. The bell ringer at Petrov Cathedral tricked him by ringing the bell an hour early, and keeping his word, the general and his army left.{{sfn|Henig|2000|p=93}} As a historic tribute to the event, the bell at Petrov Cathedral still rings for noon an hour earlier, at 11&nbsp;o'clock. At this hour every day, the Brno astronomical clock also releases a glass ball as a souvenir.
