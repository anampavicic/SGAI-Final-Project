'''Madaba''' ({{langx|ar|مادبا}}; [[Biblical Hebrew]]: {{Script/Hebrew|מֵידְבָא}} ''Mēḏəḇāʾ''; {{langx|grc|Μήδαβα}}<ref>Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica, § M449.6</ref><ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0526.tlg001.perseus-grc1:13.15.4 Flavius Josephus, Antiquitates Judaicae, § 13.15.4]</ref><ref>[https://topostext.org/work/241#G203.15 Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica, § G203.15]</ref>) is the capital city of [[Madaba Governorate]] in central [[Jordan]], with a population of about 60,000. It is best known for its [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Umayyad]] [[mosaics]], especially a large Byzantine-era mosaic map of the Holy Land. Madaba is located {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=off}} south-west of the capital [[Amman]].

==History==
Madaba dates from the Middle [[Bronze Age]].

The town of Madaba was once a [[Moab]]ite border city, mentioned in the [[Bible]] in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 21:30 and [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 13:9.<ref>{{cite web |title=Madaba history |url=https://madabamosaic.com/madaba-history/ |website=MadabaMosaics.com |access-date=January 19, 2023}}</ref> Control over the city changed back and forth between [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Moab]], as mentioned in the [[Mesha Stele]].

During its rule by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] empires from the 2nd to the 7th centuries, the city formed part of the [[Arabia Petraea|Provincia Arabia]] set up by the Roman Emperor [[Trajan]] to replace the [[Nabataean]] kingdom of [[Petra]].

The first evidence for a [[Christians|Christian]] community in the city, with its own [[bishop]], is found in the Acts of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, where Constantine, Metropolitan Archbishop of [[Bostra]] (the provincial capital) signed on behalf of Gaiano, "Bishop of the Medabeni." It was conquered by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] in 629 after the [[Battle of Mut'ah]].

During the rule of the [[Islamic]] [[Umayyad Caliphate]], it was part of the southern district of [[Jund Filastin]] within the [[Bilad al-Sham]] province.

===Modern settlement===
[[File:Madaba08(js).jpg|thumb|left|Greek Orthodox Basilica of Saint George, Madaba]]
In 1880, 90 [[Arab Christian]] families from [[Al Karak]] resettled the ruins of Madaba, led by two [[Italy|Italian]] priests from the Latin Patriarchate of [[Jerusalem]].<ref>[[PEF Survey of Palestine]], [https://archive.org/details/surveyofeasternp00conduoft Survey of Eastern Palestine] (1889), page 291: "In the midst of these tribes a colony of native Christians is established at Madeba. They were converted at Kerak in 1880 by Jesuit missionaries from Jerusalem, and established themselves early in 1881 at the ruined town of Madeba."</ref> This period saw the start of [[archaeology|archaeological]] research. This in turn substantially supplemented the scant documentation available.

The [[Catholic Church]]'s list of [[titular see]]s uses the spelling "Medaba", in reference to the ancient bishopric located in this city, while referring to the modern city as "Madaba".<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 926</ref>

Today, the city is the seat of Madaba Governorate and is the 9th-biggest city in Jordan, with a population of 122,008 as of 2021.

==Archaeological finds==

===In Madaba city===

[[File:Hippolytus Hall.jpg|thumb|Hippolytus Hall in the Archaeological Park of Madaba]]
The first mosaics were discovered during the building of new houses using [[ashlar|bricks]] from [[spolia|older buildings]]. The new inhabitants of Madaba, made conscious of the importance of the mosaics by their priests, made sure that they took care of and preserved all the mosaics that came to light.

The northern part of the city turned out to be the area containing the greatest concentration of mosaics. During the Byzantine-Umayyad period, this northern area, crossed by a colonnaded [[Roman road]], saw the building of the Church of the Map, the Hippolytus Mansion, the Church of the Virgin Mary, the Church of Prophet Elijah with its crypt, the Church of the Holy Martyrs (Al-Khadir), the Burnt Palace, the Church of the Sunna' family, and the church of the salaita family.

[[File:Madaba Jerusalem Mosaic.jpg|thumb|left|A 6th-century mosaic map of Jerusalem in the [[Madaba Map]]]]
The [[Map of Madaba]] mosaic was discovered in 1896 and the findings were published a year later. This discovery drew the attention of scholars worldwide. It also positively influenced the inhabitants, who shared the contagious passion of [[F. Giuseppe Manfredi]], to whom the rediscovery of most of the city's mosaics are owed. Madaba became known as the "City of Mosaics" in Jordan.

The Madaba Mosaic Map is a map of the region dating from the 6th century and preserved in the floor of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] [[Basilica]] of [[Saint George]], sometimes called the "Church of the Map". With two million pieces of coloured stone, the map depicts hills and valleys, villages and towns in Palestine and the Nile Delta. The mosaic contains the earliest extant representation of Byzantine [[Jerusalem]], labeled the "Holy City." The map provides important details about its 6th-century landmarks, with the [[cardo]], or central colonnaded street, and the church of the [[Holy Sepulchre]] clearly visible. This map is one key in developing scholarly knowledge about the physical layout of Jerusalem after its destruction and rebuilding in 70 AD.

Other mosaic masterpieces found in the Church of the Virgin and the Apostles and the Archaeological Museum, depict a profusion of flowers and plants, birds and fish, animals and exotic beasts, as well as scenes from mythology and everyday pursuits of hunting, fishing and farming. Hundreds of other mosaics from the 5th through the 7th centuries are scattered throughout Madaba.

The [[University of Toronto]] has been excavating in Madaba from 1996 until the present. Their efforts have focused primarily on the west acropolis where an open field has allowed access to uncover the entire sequence of occupation at Madaba from the modern period down to the Early Bronze Age levels. The most visible feature of this area is a {{convert|7.5|m|ft|adj=mid|-wide|sp=us}} fortification wall built sometime in the 9th century BC, with subsequent rebuilds throughout its history.  There is also the remains of a well-preserved Byzantine-era house at the base of the fortification wall.<ref>[https://www.utoronto.ca/tmap The Tell Madaba Archaeological Project (TMAP)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527202854/http://www.utoronto.ca/tmap |date=May 27, 2008 }}</ref>

In 2010, a 3,000-year-old Iron Age temple containing several figurines of ancient deities and circular clay vessels used in [[Moab]]ite religious rituals was discovered at Khirbat 'Ataroz near Mabada.<ref>{{cite web

===In Khirbat Ataruz===
[[Khirbat Ataruz]], also known as [[Ataroth]], is mentioned prominently in the [[Mesha stele]] and its ruins are located in Madaba Governorate, outside of Madaba city. It was conquered by Israelite King [[Omri]], as discussed in the [[Mesha stele]], Book of Numbers 32, and 2nd [[Books of Kings]] 3:4–27. The oldest inscription in the [[Moabite language]] script, dated to the late 9th or early 8th century BC, was found at Khirbat Ataruz.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bean |first1=Adam |last2=Rollston |first2=Christopher |title=Moabite language |journal=Levant -- the Journal of the Council for British Research in the Levant |date=2018 |volume=50 |issue=2 |page=2011}}</ref>

===Madaba Institute for Mosaic Art and Restoration===
The Institute of Mosaic Art and Restoration was founded in 1992 as the Madaba Mosaic School, and funded by the Italian government. It was a high school which offered the Tawjihi, the Jordanian equivalent of a high school diploma. In 2007, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, under the Department of Antiquities, partnered with USAID's [[Jordan Tourism Development Project (Siyaha)|Siyaha]] tourism development project, and the Italian government to launch the institute as a two-year, post-secondary educational program. The institute offers diplomas in Mosaic Art Production and Restoration. The institute is located between the Madaba Visitors Center and the Madaba Archaeological Park.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the Institute |url=http://www.mimarjordan.org/?url=en/History-of-the-Institute |website=MIMAR |access-date=January 19, 2023}}</ref>

==Points of interest==
[[File:20100924 madaba34.JPG|thumb|The Madaba visitors center]]

* Madaba's main attraction is its Byzantine mosaics, drawing many visitors, especially since the creation of an archaeological park. They cover the floors of houses and churches dating from the site's earliest period of habitation.
* Southwest of Madaba is Hammamat Ma'in ([[Ma'in Hot Springs]]), thermal mineral springs that for centuries have attracted people for its purported therapeutic properties.
* The nearby site of [[Umm ar-Rasas]], south-east of Madaba on the edge of the semi-arid steppe, started as a Roman military camp and grew to become a town from the 5th century. It also has very large and well-preserved mosaics.
* At the southern entrance to Madaba, near the King's Highway, is the Church of the Apostles. The ruins of this Byzantine church date to 578 CE, and are currently being restored. It includes a mosaic known as the "Personification of the Sea", depicting a woman emerging from the sea, surrounded by mythical aquatic creatures and a hodgepodge of rams, bulls, parrots and exotic vegetation. The mosaic was signed by a mosaicist named Salamanios.

[[File:Bani Hamida Weavings.jpg|thumb|Bani Hamida Weavings]] 
* A weaving project started by twelve women of the [[Bani Hamida]] tribe in 1985 produces woven items in traditionally bright colors. Traditional ground looms, assembled using stones and sticks, are used for the weaving, and the products can be found at numerous outlets in Jordan and abroad. Visitors can stop by the weaving rooms, located in the village of Mukawir, to see how the rugs are made. The women also make decorative candles.
* The [[American University of Madaba]] opened in 2011, and is located on a 100-acre campus outside the city.
