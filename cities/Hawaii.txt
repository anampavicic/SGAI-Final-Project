The State of Hawaii derives its name from the name of its largest island, {{lang|haw|[[Hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i]]|italic=no}}.

{{Main Hawaiian Islands}}

There are eight main Hawaiian islands. Seven are inhabited, but only six are open to tourists and locals. Ni{{okina}}ihau is privately managed by brothers Bruce and [[Keith Robinson (environmentalist)|Keith Robinson]]; access is restricted to those who have their permission. This island is also home to native Hawaiians. Access to uninhabited [[Kahoʻolawe]] island is also restricted and anyone who enters without permission will be arrested. This island may also be dangerous since it was a military base during the world wars and could still have unexploded ordnance.

Like Alaska, Hawaii borders no other U.S. state. It is the only U.S. state not in North America, and the only one completely surrounded by water and entirely an archipelago.

In addition to the eight main islands, the state has many smaller islands and islets. [[Kaʻula|Ka{{okina}}ula]] is a small island near Ni{{okina}}ihau. The [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]] is a group of nine small, older islands northwest of Kaua{{okina}}i that extends from [[Nihoa]] to [[Kure Atoll]]; these are remnants of once much larger volcanic mountains. Across the archipelago are around 130 small rocks and islets, such as [[Molokini]], which are made up of either volcanic or marine sedimentary rock.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rubin |first=Ken |title=General Information about Hawaiian Shield Volcanoes |url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/HCV/haw_volc.html |url-status=live |access-date=December 1, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229054039/http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/HCV/haw_volc.html |archive-date=December 29, 2010}}</ref>

===Geology===
{{see also|Hawaii hotspot}}
[[File:Pāhoehoe lava meets Pacific.jpg|thumb|left|{{lang|haw|Pāhoehoe}} (smooth lava) spills into the ocean, forming new rock]]
The Hawaiian islands were formed by volcanic activity initiated at an undersea [[magma]] source called the [[Hawaii hotspot|Hawai{{okina}}i hotspot]]. The process is continuing to build islands; the [[tectonic plate]] beneath much of the Pacific Ocean continually moves northwest and the hotspot remains stationary, slowly creating new volcanoes. Because of the hotspot's location, all active land volcanoes are on the southern half of Hawai{{okina}}i Island. The newest volcano, [[Kamaʻehuakanaloa Seamount|Kamaʻehuakanaloa]] (formerly Lō{{okina}}ihi), is south of the coast of Hawai{{okina}}i Island.

The last volcanic eruption outside Hawai{{okina}}i Island occurred at {{lang|haw|[[Haleakalā]]|italic=no}} on Maui before the late 18th{{spaces}}century, possibly hundreds of years earlier.<ref>{{cite web |title=Youngest lava flows on East Maui probably older than A.D. 1790 |url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/1999/99_09_09.html |url-status=live |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |date=September 9, 1999 |access-date=May 5, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010222184841/http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/1999/99_09_09.html |archive-date=February 22, 2001}}</ref> In 1790, [[1790 Footprints|Kīlauea exploded]]; it is the deadliest eruption known to have occurred in the modern era in what is now the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs074-97/ |title=Living on Active Volcanoes—The Island of Hawaii, U.S. Geological Survey Fact Sheet 074-97 |publisher=[[U.S. Geological Survey]] |access-date=November 5, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025021343/http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs074-97/ |archive-date=October 25, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> Up to 5,405 warriors and their families marching on [[Kīlauea]] were killed by the eruption.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Swanson |first1=D.A. |last2=Rausch |first2=J. |title=Human Footprints in Relation to the 1790 Eruption of Kīlauea |journal=American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting |volume=11 |pages=V11B–2022 |year=2008 |bibcode=2008AGUFM.V11B2022S}}</ref> Volcanic activity and subsequent erosion have created impressive geological features.

===Terrestrial ecology===

The archipelago's extant main islands have been above the surface of the ocean for less than 10{{spaces}}million years, a fraction of the time [[biological colonization]] and evolution have occurred there. The islands are well known for the [[biodiversity|environmental diversity]] that occurs on high mountains within a trade winds field. Native Hawaiians developed complex horticultural practices to utilize the surrounding ecosystem for agriculture. Cultural practices developed to enshrine values of environmental stewardship and reciprocity with the natural world, resulting in widespread biodiversity and intricate social and environmental relationships that persist to this day.<ref name="LaDuke 1999">{{Cite book |last=LaDuke |first=Winona |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41572567 |title=All our relations : native struggles for land and life |date=1999 |publisher=South End Press |isbn=0-89608-600-3 |location=Cambridge, MA |oclc=41572567}}</ref> On a single island, the climate around the coasts can range from dry tropical (less than {{convert|20|in|mm|disp=or|sp=us}} annual rainfall) to wet tropical; on the slopes, environments range from [[tropical rainforest]] (more than {{convert|200|in|mm|disp=or|sp=us}} per year), through a [[temperate climate]], to [[Mountain|alpine]] conditions with a cold, dry climate.

===First human settlement – Ancient Hawai{{okina}}i (1000–1778)===

{{Main|Ancient Hawaii}}

The 1778 arrival of British explorer Captain [[James Cook]] marked the first documented contact by a European explorer with Hawai{{okina}}i; early British influence can be seen in the design of the [[Flag of Hawaii|flag of Hawai{{okina}}i]], which bears the [[Union Jack]] in the top-left corner. Cook named the archipelago "the Sandwich Islands" in honor of his sponsor [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich]], publishing the islands' location and rendering the native name as ''Owyhee''. The form "[[Owyhee (disambiguation)|Owyhee" or "Owhyhee"]] is preserved in the names of certain locations in the American part of the Pacific Northwest, among them [[Owyhee County, Idaho|Owyhee County]] and [[Owyhee Mountains]] in [[Idaho]], named after three native Hawaiian members of a trapping party who went missing in the area.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Name Owyhee|url=http://www.history.idaho.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/reference-series/0036.pdf|publisher=Idaho State Historical Society|access-date=January 1, 2015|date=August 1964|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816231420/http://history.idaho.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/reference-series/0036.pdf|archive-date=August 16, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Conquistador|Spanish explorers]] may have arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in the 16th century, 200 years before Cook's first documented visit in 1778. [[Ruy López de Villalobos]] commanded a fleet of six ships that left [[Acapulco]] in 1542 bound for the Philippines, with a Spanish sailor named Juan Gaetano aboard as pilot.

Despite such contested claims, Cook is generally considered the first European to land at Hawai{{okina}}i, having visited the Hawaiian Islands twice. As he prepared for departure after his second visit in 1779, a quarrel ensued as he took temple idols and fencing as "firewood",<ref>Stanley D.

After Cook's visit and the publication of several books relating his voyages, the Hawaiian Islands attracted many European and American explorers, traders, and whalers, who found the islands to be a convenient harbor and source of supplies.

====House of Kamehameha====

[[File:Kamehameha Statue and flag.jpg|thumb|Kamehameha I conquered the Hawaiian Islands and established a unified monarchy across the archipelago.]]

During the 1780s, and 1790s, chiefs often fought for power. After a series of battles that ended in 1795, all inhabited islands were subjugated under a single ruler, who became known as [[Kamehameha I|King Kamehameha the Great]]. He established the [[House of Kamehameha]], a dynasty that ruled the kingdom until 1872.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fry|first1=Kathie|title=Kamehameha Dynasty|url=http://www.hawaiiforvisitors.com/monarchy/kamehameha-dynasty.htm|website=Hawaii for Visitors|access-date=November 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107221138/http://www.hawaiiforvisitors.com/monarchy/kamehameha-dynasty.htm|archive-date=November 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

After [[Kamehameha II]] inherited the throne in 1819, American Protestant missionaries to Hawai{{okina}}i converted many Hawaiians to Christianity.

====1887 Constitution and overthrow preparations====
In 1887, Kalākaua was forced to sign the [[1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii|1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]]. Drafted by white businessmen and lawyers, the document stripped the king of much of his authority. It established a property qualification for voting that effectively disenfranchised most Hawaiians and immigrant laborers and favored the wealthier, white elite. Resident whites were allowed to vote but resident Asians were not. As the 1887 Constitution was signed under threat of violence, it is known as the Bayonet Constitution. King Kalākaua, reduced to a figurehead, reigned until his death in 1891. His sister, Queen [[Liliuokalani|Lili{{okina}}uokalani]], succeeded him; she was the last monarch of Hawai{{okina}}i.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?e=d-0kingdom3-000Sec--11en-50-20-frameset-book--1-010escapewin&a=d&d=D0.21&toc=0|title=Ulukau: The Hawaiian kingdom, vol. 3, 1874–1893, The Kalakaua dynasty|website=www.ulukau.org|access-date=February 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120043915/http://www.ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?e=d-0kingdom3-000Sec--11en-50-20-frameset-book--1-010escapewin&a=d&d=D0.21&toc=0|archive-date=January 20, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1893, Lili{{okina}}uokalani announced plans for a new constitution to proclaim herself an absolute monarch. On January 14, 1893, a group of mostly Euro-American business leaders and residents formed the [[Committee of Safety (Hawaii)|Committee of Safety]] to stage a [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|coup d'état]] against the kingdom and seek annexation by the United States. U.S. Government Minister [[John L. Stevens]], responding to a request from the Committee of Safety, summoned a company of U.S. Marines. The queen's soldiers did not resist.

On January 17, 1893, a small group of sugar and pineapple-growing businessmen, aided by the American minister to Hawaii and backed by heavily armed U.S. soldiers and marines, deposed Queen Lili{{Okina}}uokalani and installed a provisional government composed of members of the Committee of Safety.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web |title=Digital History |url=https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=3&amp;psid=1283 |access-date=2022-06-10 |website=www.digitalhistory.uh.edu}}</ref> According to scholar Lydia Kualapai and Hawaii State Representative Roy Takumi, this committee was formed against the will of Indigenous Hawaiian voters, who constituted the majority of voters at the time, and consisted of "thirteen white men" according to scholar J Kehaulani Kauanui.<ref name="KUALAPAI 2005 32–62">{{Cite journal |last=Kualapai |first=Lydia |date=2005 |title=The Queen Writes Back: Lili'uokalani's Hawaii's Story by Hawaii's Queen |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20737264 |journal=Studies in American Indian Literatures |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=32–62 |doi=10.1353/ail.2005.0053 |jstor=20737264 |s2cid=161123895 |issn=0730-3238}}</ref><ref name="Takumi 1994 8–9"/><ref name="Kauanui 2004 145–150"/> The United States Minister to the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] ([[John L.

Controversy ensued in the following years as the queen tried to regain her throne. Scholar Lydia Kualapai writes that Lili{{okina}}uokalani had "yielded under protest not to the counterfeit Provisional Government of Hawaii but to the superior force of the United States of America" and wrote letters of protest to the president requesting a recognizance of allyship and a reinstatement of her sovereignty against the recent actions of the Provisional Government of Hawaii.<ref name="KUALAPAI 2005 32–62"/> Following the January 1893 coup that deposed Lili{{Okina}}uokalani, many royalists were preparing to overthrow the white-led Republic of Hawai{{okina}}i oligarchy. Hundreds of rifles were covertly shipped to Hawaii and hidden in caves nearby. As armed troops came and went, a Republic of Hawai{{okina}}i patrol discovered the rebel group. On January 6, 1895, gunfire began on both sides and later the rebels were surrounded and captured. Over the next 10 days several skirmishes occurred, until the last armed opposition surrendered or were captured. The Republic of Hawai{{okina}}i took 123 troops into custody as prisoners of war. The mass arrest of nearly 300 more men and women, including Queen Lili{{Okina}}uokalani, as political prisoners was intended to incapacitate the political resistance against the ruling oligarchy. In March 1895, a military tribunal convicted 170 prisoners of treason and sentenced six troops to be "hung by the neck" until dead, according to historian Ronald Williams Jr. The other prisoners were variously sentenced to from five to thirty-five years' imprisonment at hard labor, while those convicted of lesser charges received sentences from six months' to six years' imprisonment at hard labor.<ref name=":3">{{cite journal |last=Williams |first=Ronald Jr. |date=2021 |title=Incarcerating a Nation: The Arrest and Imprisonment of Political Prisoners by the Republic of Hawai'i, 1895 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/840143 |journal=Hawaiian Journal of History |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=167–176 |doi=10.1353/hjh.2021.0005 |s2cid=244913179 |issn=2169-7639}}</ref> The queen was sentenced to five years in prison, but spent eight months under house arrest until she was released on parole.<ref>{{cite book |last=Menton |first=Linda K. |title=A History of Hawaii, Student Book |publisher=Curriculum Research & Development Group |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-937049-94-5 |edition=2nd |location=Honolulu, HI}}</ref> The total number of arrests related to the 1895 Kaua Kūloko was 406 people on a summary list of statistics, published by the government of the Republic of Hawai{{okina}}i.<ref name=":3" />

The administration of President [[Grover Cleveland]] commissioned the [[Blount Report]], which concluded that the removal of Lili{{okina}}uokalani had been illegal.

In 1900, Hawai{{okina}}i was granted self-governance and retained [[Iolani Palace|{{okina}}Iolani Palace]] as the territorial capitol building. Despite several attempts to become a state, Hawaii remained a territory for 60 years. Plantation owners and capitalists, who maintained control through financial institutions such as the [[Big Five (Hawaii)|Big Five]], found territorial status convenient because they remained able to import cheap, foreign labor.

In the 1950s, the plantation owners' power was broken by the descendants of immigrant laborers, who were born in Hawai{{okina}}i and were U.S. citizens. They voted against the [[Hawaii Republican Party|Hawai{{okina}}i Republican Party]], strongly supported by plantation owners. The new majority voted for the [[Democratic Party of Hawaii|Democratic Party of Hawai{{okina}}i]], which dominated territorial and state politics for more than 40 years. Eager to gain full representation in Congress and the Electoral College, residents actively campaigned for statehood. In Washington, there was talk that Hawai{{okina}}i would be a Republican Party stronghold. As a result, the admission of Hawaii was matched with the admission of Alaska, which was seen as a Democratic Party stronghold. These predictions proved inaccurate; as of 2017, Hawai{{okina}}i generally votes Democratic, while Alaska typically votes Republican.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/188969/red-states-outnumber-blue-first-time-gallup-tracking.aspx|title=Red States Outnumber Blue for First Time in Gallup Tracking|website=gallup.com|access-date=January 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104092539/http://www.gallup.com/poll/188969/red-states-outnumber-blue-first-time-gallup-tracking.aspx|archive-date=January 4, 2017|url-status=live|date=February 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>[ 2016 election result—Politico]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.boundless.com/political-science/textbooks/boundless-political-science-textbook/interest-groups-7/modern-political-parties-59/red-states-vs-blue-states-337-4262/|title=Red States vs. Blue States|last=Boundless|date=August 8, 2016|website=Boundless.com|access-date=January 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112151613/https://www.boundless.com/political-science/textbooks/boundless-political-science-textbook/interest-groups-7/modern-political-parties-59/red-states-vs-blue-states-337-4262/|archive-date=November 12, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://elections.nbcnews.com/ns/politics/2012/all/president/|title=2012 Presidential Race—Election Results by State—NBC News|date=December 2, 2011|website=nbcnews.com|access-date=January 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106174223/http://elections.nbcnews.com/ns/politics/2012/all/president/|archive-date=January 6, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

After Europeans and [[Mainland United States|mainland Americans]] first arrived during the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] period, the overall population of Hawaii—which until that time composed solely of Indigenous Hawaiians—fell dramatically. Many people of the Indigenous Hawaiian population died to foreign diseases, declining from 300,000 in the 1770s, to 60,000 in the 1850s, to 24,000 in 1920. Other estimates for the pre-contact population range from 150,000 to 1.5 million.<ref name="OHA"/> The population of Hawaii began to finally increase after an influx of primarily Asian settlers that arrived as migrant laborers at the end of the 19th{{spaces}}century.<ref name="Hawaiian Encyclopedia">{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiianencyclopedia.com/population-and-visitor-statist.asp |title=Hawaiian Encyclopedia : Population and Visitor Statistics |publisher=Hawaiianencyclopedia.com |date=July 1, 2002 |access-date=January 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214051108/http://www.hawaiianencyclopedia.com/population-and-visitor-statist.asp |archive-date=December 14, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1923, 42% of the population was of Japanese descent, 9% was of Chinese descent, and 16% was native descent.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The States|url=https://time.com/vault/issue/1923-03-03/page/8/ |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |page=8 |date=March 3, 1923 |access-date=March 1, 2021}}</ref>

The unmixed indigenous Hawaiian population has still not restored itself to its 300,000 pre-contact level. {{as of|2010}}, only 156,000 persons declared themselves to be of Native Hawaiian-only ancestry, just over half the pre-contact level Native Hawaiian population, although an additional 371,000 persons declared themselves to possess Native Hawaiian ancestry in combination with one or more other races (including other Polynesian groups, but mostly [[Asian people|Asian]] or [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]]).

{{As of|2018}}, the [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates the population of Hawaii at 1,420,491, a decrease of 7,047 from the previous year and an increase of 60,190 (4.42%) since 2010. This includes a natural increase of 48,111 (96,028 births minus 47,917 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 16,956 people into the state.

Before the arrival of Captain James Cook, the Hawaiian language had no written form. That form was developed mainly by American Protestant missionaries between 1820 and 1826 who assigned to the Hawaiian phonemes letters from the Latin alphabet. Interest in Hawaiian increased significantly in the late 20th century. With the help of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, specially designated immersion schools in which all subjects would be taught in Hawaiian were established. The [[University of Hawaiʻi]] developed a Hawaiian-language graduate studies program. Municipal codes were altered to favor Hawaiian place and street names for new civic developments.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.honolulumagazine.com/how-honolulu-gets-its-street-names-and-neighborhood-themes/ |title=How Honolulu Gets Its Street Names and Neighborhood Themes |magazine=[[Honolulu (magazine)|Honolulu]] |date=4 September 2018 |access-date=26 June 2022}}</ref>

Hawaiian distinguishes between [[Vowel length|long and short vowel sounds]]. In modern practice, vowel length is indicated with a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] (''[[Hawaiian language#Orthography|kahakō]]''). Hawaiian-language newspapers (''nūpepa'') published from 1834 to 1948 and traditional native speakers of Hawaiian generally omit the marks in their own writing. The ʻokina and kahakō are intended to capture the proper pronunciation of Hawaiian words.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.hawaii.edu/~strauch/tips/HawaiianOrthography.html |title=Using Correct Hawaiian Orthography |date=15 August 2012 |access-date=26 June 2022}}</ref> The Hawaiian language uses the [[glottal stop]] (''[[ʻOkina]]'') as a consonant.

====Hawaiian Pidgin====
{{main|Hawaiian Pidgin}}
{{more citations needed section|date=June 2021}}
[[File:Hermann A. Widemann and family, ca. 1850s.jpg|thumb|Mixed Hawaiian/European-American family in Honolulu, 1850s]]
Some residents of '''Hawaii''' speak [[Hawaiian Pidgin|Hawaiʻi Creole English]] (HCE), endonymically called ''pidgin'' or ''pidgin English''. The lexicon of HCE derives mainly from English but also uses words that have derived from Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Ilocano and Tagalog. During the 19th century, the increase in immigration—mainly from China, Japan, Portugal—especially from the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]], and Spain—catalyzed the development of a hybrid variant of English known to its speakers as ''pidgin''. By the early 20th century, pidgin speakers had children who acquired it as their first language. HCE speakers use some Hawaiian words without those words being considered archaic.{{clarify|date=March 2015|reason=https://www.hawaii.edu/satocenter/langnet/definitions/hce.html}} Most place names are retained from Hawaiian, as are some names for plants and animals. For example, tuna fish is often called by its Hawaiian name, ''ahi''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hawai'i Creole English|url=https://www.hawaii.edu/satocenter/langnet/definitions/hce.html|access-date=May 19, 2021|website=www.hawaii.edu}}</ref>

HCE speakers have modified the meanings of some English words. For example, "aunty" and "uncle" may either refer to any adult who is a friend or be used to show respect to an elder. [[Syntax]] and [[grammar]] follow distinctive rules different from those of General American English. For example, instead of "it is hot today, isn't it?", an HCE speaker would say simply "stay hot, eh?"{{efn|English "to be" is often omitted in Pidgin. In contexts where "to be" is used in [[General American]], "to stay" is preferred. "To stay" may have arisen due to an English calque of the Portuguese ''[[wikt:ser#Portuguese|ser]]'', ''[[wikt:estar#Portuguese|estar]]'', or ''[[wikt:ficar#Portuguese|ficar]]''. ''Eh?'' ({{IPA-all|æ̃ː˧˦}}) is a [[tag question]] which may have roots in Japanese, which uses ね (ne?) to emphasize a point that may be agreed upon by all parties, or may come from Portuguese [[wikt:né#Portuguese|né?]] (shortened from "[[wikt:não é#Portuguese|não é?]]"), cf. French [[wikt:n'est-ce pas#French|n'est-ce pas ?]]. ''Eh?'' may also have come from English ''yeah''.}} The term ''[[da kine]]'' is used as a [[Filler (linguistics)|filler]]; a substitute for virtually any word or phrase. During the [[surfing]] boom in Hawaii, HCE was influenced by surfer slang. Some HCE expressions, such as ''brah'' and ''da kine'', have found their ways elsewhere through surfing communities.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sood |first=Suemedha |url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20120418-travelwise-surfer-lingo-explained |title=Surfer lingo, explained |publisher=BBC |date=April 20, 2012 |access-date=December 9, 2020}}</ref>

====Hawaiʻi Sign Language====
[[Hawaiʻi Sign Language]], a [[sign language]] for the Deaf based on the Hawaiian language, has been in use in the islands since the early 1800s. It is dwindling in numbers due to [[American Sign Language]] supplanting HSL through schooling and various other domains.<ref>{{cite web |last=Chin |first=Corinne |title=The fight to save Hawaii Sign Language from extinction |url=https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/08/americas/hawaii-sign-language-extinction-as-equals-intl-cmd/index.html |publisher=CNN |access-date=April 23, 2022}}</ref>

Cook's second lieutenant and co-astronomer [[James King (Royal Navy officer)|James King]] observed that "all the chiefs had them", and recounts that Cook was actually asked by one chief to leave King behind, considering the role a great honor.

Hawaiian scholar [[Lilikalā Kameʻeleihiwa]] notes that ''aikāne'' served a practical purpose of building mutual trust and cohesion; "If you didn't sleep with a man, how could you trust him when you went into battle? How would you know if he was going to be the warrior that would protect you at all costs, if he wasn't your lover?"<ref name="mahu">{{cite AV media |people= Xian, Kathryn and Brent Anbe (Directors)|year= 2001|title= ''Ke Kūlana He Māhū'': Remembering a Sense of Place|medium= DVD}}</ref>

As Western colonial influences intensified in the late 19th and early 20th century, the word ''aikāne'' was [[Expurgation|expurgated]] of its original sexual meaning, and in print simply meant "friend". Nonetheless, in Hawaiian language publications its metaphorical meaning can still mean either "friend" or "lover" without stigmatization.<ref>{{cite book|author=Noenoe K.

Hawaii's very high [[cost of living]] is the result of several interwoven factors of the global economy in addition to domestic U.S. government trade policy. Like other regions with desirable weather year-round, such as California, [[Arizona]] and Florida, Hawaii's residents can be considered to be subject to a "[[sunshine tax]]". This situation is further exacerbated by the natural factors of geography and world distribution that lead to higher prices for goods due to increased shipping costs, a problem which many [[island country|island states and territories]] suffer from as well.

The higher costs to ship goods across an ocean may be further increased by the requirements of the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920|Jones Act]], which generally requires that goods be transported between places within the U.S., including between the mainland U.S. west coast and Hawaii, using only U.S.-owned, built, and crewed ships. Jones Act-compliant vessels are often more expensive to build and operate than foreign equivalents, which can drive up shipping costs. While the Jones Act does not affect transportation of goods to Hawaii directly from Asia, this type of trade is nonetheless not common; this is a result of other primarily economic reasons including additional costs associated with stopping over in Hawaii (e.g. pilot and port fees), the market size of Hawaii, and the economics of using ever-larger ships that cannot be handled in Hawaii for transoceanic voyages. Therefore, Hawaii relies on receiving most inbound goods on Jones Act-qualified vessels originating from the U.S. west coast, which may contribute to the increased cost of some consumer goods and therefore the overall cost of living.<ref name="Keeping up with the Jones Act">{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/Hawaii-Business/August-2012/The-pros-and-cons-of-the-Jones-Act/ |title=Keeping up with the Jones Act |date=August 2012 |website=[[Hawaii Business]] |publisher=PacificBasin Communications |location=Honolulu, HI |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823083544/http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/Hawaii-Business/August-2012/The-pros-and-cons-of-the-Jones-Act/ |archive-date=August 23, 2012 |url-status=live|access-date=March 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name="U.S. Law Restricting Foreign Ships Leads to Higher Gas Prices">{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/ID/10736/Jones-Act-Does-Not-Bar-International-Trade-From-Hawaii.aspx|title=Jones Act Does Not Bar International Trade From Hawaii|last=Hansen|first=Michael|date=October 3, 2013|publisher=Hawaiʻi Free Press|location=Honolulu, HI |access-date=July 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728040004/http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/ID/10736/Jones-Act-Does-Not-Bar-International-Trade-From-Hawaii.aspx|archive-date=July 28, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Critics of the Jones Act contend that Hawaii consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods imposed by the Jones Act.<ref name="Star-Bulletin on Jones Act">{{cite news |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/97/04/08/business/story3.html |title=U.S.-only shipping rule praised, blasted; Backers and foes of the Jones Act make their case before the Legislature |first=Russ |last=Lynch |newspaper=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |date=April 4, 1997 |location=Honolulu, HI |publisher=[[Black Press|Black Press Group Ltd]] |issn=0439-5271 |id={{OCLC|9188300|433678262|232117605|2268098}} |access-date=May 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013185712/http://archives.starbulletin.com/97/04/08/business/story3.html |archive-date=October 13, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of the Native Hawaiians}}

The aboriginal culture of Hawaii is Polynesian. Hawaii represents the northernmost extension of the vast [[Polynesian Triangle]] of the south and central Pacific Ocean. While traditional Hawaiian culture remains as vestiges in modern Hawaiian society, there are re-enactments of the ceremonies and traditions throughout the islands. Some of these cultural influences, including the popularity (in greatly modified form) of ''[[luau|lū{{okina}}au]]'' and ''[[hula]]'', are strong enough to affect the wider United States.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Cuisine of Hawaii}}
[[File:Man with a Yoke Carrying Taro by Joseph Strong, oil on canvas board, 1880, Honolulu Museum of Art, accession 12692.1.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A painting of a man carrying taro by a yoke.|[[Taro]], or in Hawaiian ''kalo'', was one of the primary staples in Ancient Hawaii and remains a central ingredient in Hawaiian gastronomy today.]]

The [[cuisine of Hawaii]] is a fusion of many foods brought by immigrants to the Hawaiian Islands, including the earliest Polynesians and [[Native Hawaiian cuisine]], and [[Cuisine of the United States|American]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Philippine cuisine|Filipino]], [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]], [[Korean cuisine|Korean]], [[Polynesian cuisine|Polynesian]], [[Puerto Rican cuisine|Puerto Rican]], and [[Portuguese cuisine|Portuguese]] origins. Plant and animal food sources are imported from around the world for agricultural use in Hawaii. ''[[Poi (food)|Poi]]'', a starch made by pounding [[taro]], is one of the traditional foods of the islands. Many local restaurants serve the ubiquitous [[plate lunch]], which features two scoops of rice, a simplified version of American [[macaroni salad]] and a variety of toppings including [[hamburger]] patties, a fried egg, and [[gravy]] of a ''[[loco moco]]'', Japanese style ''[[tonkatsu]]'' or the traditional lū{{okina}}au favorites, including ''[[kalua|kālua]]'' pork and ''[[laulau]]''. ''[[Spam musubi]]'' is an example of the fusion of ethnic cuisine that developed on the islands among the mix of immigrant groups and military personnel. In the 1990s, a group of chefs developed [[Hawaii regional cuisine]] as a contemporary fusion cuisine.

===Customs and etiquette===
{{Main|Customs and etiquette in Hawaii}}

Some key customs and etiquette in Hawaii are as follows: when visiting a home, it is considered good manners to bring a small gift for one's host (for example, a dessert). Thus, parties are usually in the form of potlucks. Most locals take their shoes off before entering a home. It is customary for Hawaiian families, regardless of ethnicity, to hold a luau to celebrate a child's first birthday. It is also customary at Hawaiian weddings, especially at Filipino weddings, for the bride and groom to do a money dance (also called the [[pandanggo]]). Print media and local residents recommend that one refer to non-Hawaiians as "locals of Hawaii" or "people of Hawaii".

===Hawaiian mythology===
{{Main|Hawaiian mythology}}
[[File:Ethnologisches Museum Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 009.jpg|thumb|upright|A stone carving of a Hawaiian deity, housed at a [[Culture of Germany|German]] museum]]

Hawaiian mythology includes the legends, historical tales, and sayings of the ancient Hawaiian people. It is considered a variant of a more general [[Polynesian mythology]] that developed a unique character for several centuries before {{circa|1800}}. It is associated with the [[Hawaiian religion]], which was officially suppressed in the 19th century but was kept alive by some practitioners to the modern day.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.civilbeat.org/2021/06/peter-apo-how-a-violent-battle-in-1819-still-impacts-hawaii-today/ |title=Peter Apo: How A Violent Battle In 1819 Still Impacts Hawaii Today |publisher=Honolulu Civil Beat |date=27 June 2021 |access-date=26 June 2022}}</ref> Prominent figures and terms include [[Aumakua]], the spirit of an ancestor or family god and [[Kāne]], the highest of the four major Hawaiian deities.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[File:Tahiti-Oro.jpg|thumb|upright|A sacred god figure wrapping for the war god [['Oro]], made of woven dried coconut fibre ([[sennit]]), made to protect a Polynesian god effigy (''to'o''), carved from wood]]

Polynesian mythology is the [[oral tradition]]s of the people of Polynesia, a grouping of Central and South Pacific Ocean island [[archipelago]]s in the [[Polynesian triangle]] together with the scattered cultures known as the [[Polynesian outliers]]. Polynesians speak languages that descend from a language reconstructed as [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]] that was probably spoken in the area around [[Tonga]] and [[Samoa]] in around 1000 BC.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kirch |first=Patrick Vinton |url=https://archive.org/details/hawaikiancestral0000kirc/page/99/mode/2up |title=Hawaiki, Ancestral Polynesia: An Essay in Historical Anthropology |author2=Roger Green |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-521-78309-5 |pages=99–119 |url-access=registration}}</ref>

Prior to the 15th century, [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian people]] migrated east to the [[Cook Islands]], and from there to other island groups such as Tahiti and the [[Marquesas]]. Their descendants later discovered the islands [[Tahiti]], [[Rapa Nui]], and later the Hawaiian Islands and [[New Zealand]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wilmshurst|first=Janet|author-link=Janet Wilmshurst|date=December 27, 2010|title=High-precision radiocarbon dating shows recent and rapid initial human colonization of East Polynesia|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|publisher=US National Library of Medicine|volume=108|issue=5|pages=1815–1820|doi=10.1073/pnas.1015876108|pmc=3033267|pmid=21187404|bibcode=2011PNAS..108.1815W |doi-access=free}}</ref>

The Polynesian languages are part of the [[Austronesian language family]]. Many are close enough in terms of vocabulary and grammar to be [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]]. There are also substantial cultural similarities between the various groups, especially in terms of social organization, childrearing, horticulture, building and textile technologies. Their mythologies in particular demonstrate local reworkings of commonly shared tales. The Polynesian cultures each have distinct but related oral traditions; legends or myths are traditionally considered to recount ancient history (the time of "pō") and the adventures of gods ("[[atua]]") and deified ancestors.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The music of Hawaii includes traditional and popular styles, ranging from native Hawaiian folk music to modern rock and [[hip hop music|hip hop]].

Styles such as [[slack-key guitar]] are well known worldwide, while Hawaiian-tinged music is a frequent part of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] soundtracks. Hawaii also made a major contribution to [[country music]] with the introduction of the [[steel guitar]].<ref name="Unterberger">{{cite book|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|title=Music USA|isbn=978-1-85828-421-7|location=London|publisher=Rough Guides|year=1999|pages=[https://archive.org/details/musicusaroughgui0000unte/page/465 465–473]|url=https://archive.org/details/musicusaroughgui0000unte/page/465}}</ref>

Traditional Hawaiian folk music is a major part of the state's musical heritage. The Hawaiian people have inhabited the islands for centuries and have retained much of their traditional musical knowledge. Their music is largely religious in nature, and includes chanting and dance music.

Hawaiian music has had an enormous impact on the [[Polynesian music|music of other Polynesian islands]]; according to Peter Manuel, the influence of Hawaiian music is a "unifying factor in the development of modern Pacific musics".<ref name="Manuel">{{cite book|last=Manuel|first=Peter|title=Popular Musics of the Non-Western World|url=https://archive.org/details/popularmusicsofn0000manu|url-access=registration|isbn=978-0-19-506334-9|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1988|pages=[https://archive.org/details/popularmusicsofn0000manu/page/236 236–241]}}</ref> Native Hawaiian musician and Hawaiian sovereignty activist [[Israel Kamakawiwoʻole]], famous for his medley of "[[Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World]]", was named "The Voice of Hawaii" by [[NPR]] in 2010 in its 50 great voices series.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kamakawiwo|first=Israel|publisher=NPR|url=https://www.npr.org/2010/12/06/131812500/israel-kamakawiwo-ole-the-voice-of-hawaii|title=Israel Kamakawiwo'ole: The Voice Of Hawaii|newspaper=NPR.org|date=December 6, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416062754/http://www.npr.org/2010/12/06/131812500/israel-kamakawiwo-ole-the-voice-of-hawaii|archive-date=April 16, 2017|url-status=live|access-date=April 16, 2017}}</ref>

===Sports===
Due to its distance from the continental United States, team sports in Hawaii are characterised by youth, collegial and amateur teams over professional teams, although some professional teams sports teams have at one time played in the state. Notable professional teams include [[The Hawaiians (WFL)|The Hawaiians]], which played at the [[World Football League]] in 1974 and 1975; the [[Hawaii Islanders]], a Triple-A minor league baseball team that played at the [[Pacific Coast League]] from 1961 to 1987; and [[Team Hawaii]], a [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] team that played in 1977.

Notable college sports events in Hawaii include the [[Maui Invitational Tournament]], [[Diamond Head Classic]] (basketball) and [[Hawaii Bowl]] (football). The only [[NCAA Division I]] team in Hawaii is the [[Hawaii Rainbow Warriors and Rainbow Wahine]], which competes at the [[Big West Conference]] (major sports), [[Mountain West Conference]] (football) and [[Mountain Pacific Sports Federation]] (minor sports). There are three teams in NCAA Division II: [[Chaminade Silverswords]], [[Hawaii Pacific Sharks]] and Hawaii-Hilo Vulcans, all of which compete at the [[Pacific West Conference]].

[[File:Surfing contest - oahu hawaii - north shore - oct 2015.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=6|right|Surfing at [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]] of [[Oahu]]]]

[[Surfing]] has been a central part of [[Polynesian culture]] for centuries. Since the late 19th century, Hawaii has become a major site for surfists from around the world. Notable competitions include the [[Triple Crown of Surfing]] and [[The Eddie]]. Likewise, Hawaii has produced elite-level swimmers, including five-time Olympic medalist [[Duke Kahanamoku]] and [[Buster Crabbe]], who set 16 swimming
world records.

Hawaii has hosted the [[Sony Open in Hawaii]] golf tournament since 1965, the [[Tournament of Champions (golf)|Tournament of Champions]] golf tournament since 1999, the [[Lotte Championship]] golf tournament since 2012, the [[Honolulu Marathon]] since 1973, the [[Ironman World Championship]] triathlon race since 1978, the [[Ultraman (endurance challenge)|Ultraman]] triathlon since 1983, the [[National Football League]]'s [[Pro Bowl]] from 1980 to 2016, the [[2000 FINA World Open Water Swimming Championships]], and the [[2008 Pan-Pacific Championship]] and [[2012 Hawaiian Islands Invitational]] soccer tournaments.

Hawaii has produced a number of notable [[Mixed Martial Arts]] fighters, such as former [[UFC Lightweight Champion]] and [[UFC Welterweight Champion]] [[B.J. Penn]], and former [[UFC Featherweight Champion]] [[Max Holloway]]. Other notable Hawaiian Martial Artists include [[Travis Browne]], [[K. J. Noons]], [[Brad Tavares]] and [[Wesley Correira]].

Hawaiians have found success in the world of [[sumo wrestling]]. [[Takamiyama Daigorō]] was the first foreigner to ever win a sumo title in Japan, while his protege [[Akebono Tarō]] became a top-level sumo wrestler in Japan during the 1990s before transitioning into a successful [[professional wrestling]] career in the 2000s. Akebono was the first foreign-born Sumo to reach [[Yokozuna]] in history and helped fuel a boom in interest in Sumo during his career.

Tourism is an important part of the Hawaiian economy as it represents ¼ of the economy. According to the Hawaii Tourism: 2019 Annual Visitor Research Report, a total of 10,386,673 visitors arrived in 2019 which increased 5% from the previous year, with expenditures of almost $18 billion.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Hawai{{okina}}i Tourism Authority |title=2019 Annual Visitor Research Report |url=https://files.hawaii.gov/dbedt/visitor/visitor-research/2019-annual-visitor.pdf}}</ref> In 2019, tourism provided over 216,000 jobs statewide and contributed more than $2 billion in tax revenue.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Hawai{{okina}}i Tourism Authority |title=Fact Sheet: Benefits of Hawai'i's Tourism Economy |url=https://www.hawaiitourismauthority.org/media/4167/hta-tourism-econ-impact-fact-sheet-december-2019.pdf}}</ref> Due to mild year-round weather, tourist travel is popular throughout the year. Tourists across the globe visited Hawaii in 2019 with over 1 million tourists from the U.S. East, almost 2 million Japanese tourists, and almost 500,000 Canadian tourists.

It was with statehood in 1959 that the Hawaii tourism industry began to grow.<ref name=":6">{{cite journal |last=Miller-Davenport |first=Sarah |date=February 13, 2017 |title=A 'Montage of Minorities': Hawai'i Tourism and the Commodification of Racial Tolerance, 1959–1978* |journal=The Historical Journal |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=817–842 |doi=10.1017/S0018246X16000364 |s2cid=152041916 |issn=0018-246X|doi-access=free }}</ref>

According to Hawaiian scholar [[Haunani-Kay Trask]], tourism in Hawaii has led to the commodification and exploitation of Hawaiian culture resulting in insidious forms of "cultural prostitution". Hawaii has been used to fuel ideas of escapism yet tourism in Hawaii ignores the harm Kanaka and locals experience.<ref name=TraskBL>{{cite journal |last=Trask |first=Haunani-Kay |title=Lovely Hula Lands: Corporate Tourism and the Prostitution of Hawaiian Culture |url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/bl/article/view/24958 |journal=Border/Lines |year=1991 |issue=23}}</ref> Cultural traditions such as the hula have been made "ornamental&nbsp;... a form of exotica" for tourists as a way for large corporations and land owners to gain profit over the exploitation of Hawaiian people and culture.<ref name=TraskBL/>

Tourism in Hawai{{okina}}i has been considered as an escape from reality resulting in the dismissal of violence faced by Native Hawaiians and locals living on the land. According to scholar [[Winona LaDuke]], native Hawaiians have been forced to gather "shrimp and fish from ponds sitting on resort property".<ref>{{cite book |last=LaDuke |first=Winona |chapter=Hawai'i: The Birth of the Land and Its Preservation by the Hands of the People |title=All Our Relations: Native Struggles for Land and Life |publisher=South End Press}}</ref> Tourism has also had damaging effects on the environment such as water shortages, overcrowding, sea level rising, elevated sea surface temperatures and micro plastics on beaches.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cooper |first1=Hannah |last2=Chen |first2=Qi |last3=Fletcher |first3=Charles |last4=Barbee |first4=Matthew |title=Assessing Vulnerability Due to Sea-level Rise in Maui, Hawai'i Using LiDAR Remote Sensing and GIS |journal=Climatic Change |volume=116 |issue=3–4 |pages=547–563 |date=2013 |bibcode=2013ClCh..116..547C |s2cid=545364 |doi=10.1007/s10584-012-0510-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rodgers |first1=Ku'ulei |last2=Bahr |first2=Keisha |last3=Jokiel |first3=Paul |last4=Richards Donà |first4=Angela |title=Patterns of Bleaching and Mortality following Widespread Warming Events in 2014 and 2015 at the Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve, Hawai'i |journal=PeerJ |volume=5 |pages=e3355 |date=2017 |pmid=28584703 |pmc=5452947 |doi=10.7717/peerj.3355 |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rey |first1=Savannah |last2=Franklin |first2=Janet |last3=Rey |first3=Sergio |title=Microplastic Pollution on Island Beaches, Oahu, Hawai'i |journal=PLOS ONE |year=2021 |volume=16|issue=2 |pages=e0247224 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0247224 |pmid=33600448 |pmc=7891709 |bibcode=2021PLoSO..1647224R |doi-access=free}}</ref>

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, tourism in Hawai{{okina}}i came to a halt, which allowed the land, water, and animals to began to heal. Fish like the baby akule and big ulua have returned after years of not being around the bay. The coral reefs, fish, water growth, and [[Limu (algae)|limu]] (algae) growth was able to flourish without the heavy toll of tourism.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Morimoto |first1=Tianna |title=A Time For Healing: Hawai'i's Coral Reefs Rebound During COVID-19 |url=https://hitchcockproject.org/hawaii-coral-reefs-healing/ |website=The Hitchcock Project for Visualizing Science|date=September 2020 }}</ref>

There has been pushback against tourism by Native Hawaiians, urging people not to visit the islands. A survey by the Hawaii Tourism Authority indicated over ⅔ of Hawaiians did not want tourists to return to Hawaii. Tourism had "become extractive and hurtful, with tourists coming here and taking, taking, taking, taking, without any reciprocation with locals".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mzezwa |first1=Tariro |title=In Hawaii, Reimagining Tourism for a Post-Pandemic World |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/07/travel/hawaii-covid-tourism.html |work=The New York Times|date=March 7, 2021 }}</ref>

==Health==
{{Main|Hawaii Prepaid Health Care Act}}

{{As of|2009}}, Hawaii's health care system insures 92% of residents. Under the state's plan, businesses are required to provide insurance to employees who work more than twenty hours per week. Heavy regulation of insurance companies helps reduce the cost to employers. Due in part to heavy emphasis on preventive care, Hawaiians require hospital treatment less frequently than the rest of the United States, while total health care expenses measured as a percentage of state GDP are substantially lower.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Proponents of [[universal health care]] elsewhere in the U.S. sometimes use Hawaii as a model for proposed federal and state health care plans.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Education==
===Public schools===

Hawaii has the only school system within the U.S. that is unified statewide. Policy decisions are made by the fourteen-member state [[Hawaii Board of Education|Board of Education]], which sets policy and hires the superintendent of schools, who oversees the [[Hawaii Department of Education]]. The Department of Education is divided into seven districts; four on O{{okina}}ahu and one for each of the other three counties.

Public elementary, middle and high school test scores in Hawaii are below national averages on tests mandated under the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]. The Hawaii Board of Education requires all eligible students to take these tests and report all student test scores. This may have unbalanced the results that reported in August 2005 that of 282 schools across the state, 185 failed to reach federal minimum performance standards in mathematics and reading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehawaiichannel.com/education/4870699/detail.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318182117/http://www.thehawaiichannel.com/education/4870699/detail.html |archive-date=March 18, 2007 |title=Two-Thirds of Hawaii Schools Do Not Meet Requirements—Education News Story—KITV Honolulu |publisher=Thehawaiichannel.com |date=August 18, 2005 |access-date=May 15, 2010}}</ref> The [[ACT (examination)|ACT college placement tests]] show that in 2005, seniors scored slightly above the national average (21.9 compared with 20.9),<ref>Honolulu Advertiser, August 17, 2005, p.

Independent schools can select their students, while most public schools of HIDOE are open to all students in their attendance zones. The Kamehameha Schools are the only schools in the U.S. that openly grant admission to students based on ancestry; collectively, they are one of the wealthiest schools in the United States, if not the world, having over eleven billion US dollars in estate assets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ksbe.edu/assets/annual_reports/KS_Annual_Report_2014.pdf |title=Kamehameha Schools 2013–2014 Annual Report |access-date=September 28, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603160954/http://www.ksbe.edu/assets/annual_reports/KS_Annual_Report_2014.pdf |archive-date=June 3, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2005, Kamehameha enrolled 5,398 students, 8.4% of the Native Hawaiian children in the state.<ref>

A [[List of Hawaii state highways|system of state highways]] encircles each main island. Only O{{okina}}ahu has federal highways, and is the only area outside the contiguous 48 states to have signed [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate highways]]. Narrow, winding roads and congestion in populated places can slow traffic. Each major island has a public bus system.

[[Honolulu International Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA]]:{{spaces}}HNL), which shares runways with the adjacent [[Hickam Field]] (IATA:{{spaces}}HIK), is the major commercial aviation hub of Hawaii. The commercial aviation airport offers intercontinental service to North America, Asia, Australia and Oceania. [[Hawaiian Airlines]] and [[Mokulele Airlines]] use jets to provide services between the large airports in Honolulu, Līhu{{okina}}e, Kahului, Kona and Hilo. These airlines also provide air freight services between the islands. On May 30, 2017, the airport was officially renamed as the [[Daniel K. Inouye International Airport]] (HNL), after U.S. Senator [[Daniel Inouye|Daniel K.

===Rail===
At one time Hawaii had a network of railroads on each of the larger islands that transported farm commodities and passengers. Most were {{RailGauge|3ft}} [[narrow gauge]] systems but there were some {{RailGauge|2ft6in}} gauge on some of the smaller islands. The standard gauge in the U.S. is {{RailGauge|4ft8.5in}}. By far the largest railroad was the [[Oahu Railway and Land Company]] (OR&L) that ran lines from Honolulu across the western and northern part of Oahu.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book |title=Hawaiian Railway Album—WW II Photographs Vol 2 |author1=Norton Jr., Victor |author2=Treiber, Gale E. |year=2005 |publisher=Railroad Press |location=Hanover, PA}}</ref>

The OR&L was important for moving troops and goods during World War II. Traffic on this line was busy enough for signals to be used to facilitate movement of trains and to require [[wigwag (railroad)|wigwag]] signals at some railroad crossings for the protection of motorists. The main line was officially abandoned in 1947, although part of it was bought by the U.S. Navy and operated until 1970. {{convert|13|mi|km|spell=In}} of track remain; preservationists occasionally run trains over a portion of this line.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

[[Skyline (Honolulu)|Skyline]] is an elevated passenger rail line on Oahu which was built to relieve highway congestion.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/docs/HI_Honolulu_HCT_Profile_FY17_0.pdf |title=High Capacity Transit Corridor Project: Honolulu, Hawaii |publisher= |date=December 2015 |access-date=26 June 2022}}</ref> It opened for service in 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Aquino |first1=Jamm |last2=Russell |first2=Cindy Ellen |date=2023-06-30 |title=Ridership commences on Honolulu's rail system |url=https://www.staradvertiser.com/2023/06/30/photo-gallery/ridership-commences-on-honolulus-rail-system/ |access-date=2023-07-02 |website=[[Honolulu Star-Advertiser]]}}</ref>

The movement of the Hawaiian royal family from Hawai{{okina}}i Island to Maui, and subsequently to O{{okina}}ahu, explains the modern-day distribution of population centers. [[Kamehameha III]] chose the largest city, Honolulu, as his capital because of its natural harbor—the present-day [[Honolulu Harbor]]. Now the state capital, Honolulu is located along the southeast coast of O{{okina}}ahu. The previous capital was [[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lahaina]], Maui, and before that [[Kailua-Kona]], Hawai{{okina}}i. Some major towns are [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]]; [[Kaneohe, Hawaii|Kaneohe]]; [[Kailua, Honolulu County, Hawaii|Kailua]]; [[Pearl City, Hawaii|Pearl City]]; [[Waipahu, Hawaii|Waipahu]]; [[Kahului, Hawaii|Kahului]]; [[Kailua, Hawaii County, Hawaii|Kailua-Kona]].

===State government===
{{Further|Category:State agencies of Hawaii}}
[[File:Hawaii State Capitol, Honolulu.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hawaii State Capitol]] building]]

The state government of Hawaii is modeled after the federal government with adaptations originating from the kingdom era of Hawaiian history. As codified in the [[Constitution of Hawaii]], there are three [[branches of government]]: executive, legislative and judicial. The executive branch is led by the [[Governor of Hawaii]], who is assisted by the [[Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii]], both of whom are elected on the same ticket. The governor is the only state public official elected statewide; all others are appointed by the governor. The lieutenant governor acts as the [[Secretary of State of Hawaii|Secretary of State]]. The governor and lieutenant governor oversee twenty agencies and departments from offices in the [[Hawaii State Capitol|State Capitol]]. The official residence of the governor is [[Washington Place]].

The legislative branch consists of the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Hawaii State Legislature]], which is composed of the 51-member [[Hawaii House of Representatives]] led by the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]], and the 25-member [[Hawaii Senate]] led by the [[President of the Senate]]. The Legislature meets at the State Capitol. The unified judicial branch of Hawaii is the [[Hawaii State Judiciary]]. The [[State supreme court|state's highest court]] is the [[Supreme Court of Hawaii]], which uses [[Aliiolani Hale|Ali{{okina}}iōlani Hale]] as its chambers.

[[Brian Schatz]] is the senior United States senator from Hawaii. He was appointed to the office on December 26, 2012, by Governor [[Neil Abercrombie]], following the death of former senator [[Daniel Inouye]]. Schatz then won the 2014 special election, and the 2016 and 2022 regular elections in Hawaii as Senator.

The state's junior senator is [[Mazie Hirono]], the former representative from the second congressional district. She won in the 2012 and 2018 elections for Senator in Hawaii, following the retirement of [[Daniel Akaka]]. Hirono is the first female Asian American senator and the first Buddhist senator. 

Hawaii incurred the biggest [[Seniority in the United States Senate|seniority]] shift between the [[112th United States Congress|112th]] and [[113th United States Congress|113th]] Congresses. The state went from a delegation consisting of senators who were first and twenty-first in seniority{{efn|Senator Inouye, who ranked first in seniority, died in December 2012.

Federal officials in Hawaii are based at the [[Prince Kuhio Federal Building|Prince Kūhiō Federal Building]] near the [[Aloha Tower]] and Honolulu Harbor. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[Internal Revenue Service]] and the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] maintain their offices there; the building is also the site of the [[United States federal courts|federal]] [[United States District Court for the District of Hawaii|District Court for the District of Hawaii]] and the [[United States Attorney for the District of Hawaii]].

Since gaining statehood and participating in its first election in [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]], Hawaii has supported Democrats in all but two presidential elections: [[1972 United States presidential election in Hawaii|1972]] and [[1984 United States presidential election in Hawaii|1984]], both of which were landslide reelection victories for Republicans [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] respectively. In Hawaii's statehood tenure, only Minnesota has supported Republican candidates fewer times in presidential elections.

In [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]], [[John Kerry]] won the state's four electoral votes by a margin of nine percentage points with 54% of the vote. Every county supported the Democratic candidate. In 1964, [[favorite son]] candidate senator Hiram Fong of Hawaii sought the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential nomination, while [[Patsy Mink]] ran in the Oregon primary in 1972.

===Law enforcement===
Hawaii has a statewide sheriff department under its [[Hawaii Department of Public Safety|Department of Public Safety]] that provides law enforcement protection to government buildings and [[Daniel K. Inouye International Airport]] as well as correction services to all correctional facilities owned by the state.

Counties have their own respective police departments with their own jurisdictions:

*[[Kauai County Police Department]] for the island of Kauai
*[[Honolulu Police Department]] for Oahu
*[[Maui County Police Department]] for Molokai, Maui and Lanai
*[[Hawaii County Police Department]] for the Big Island

Forensic services for all agencies in the state are provided by the [[Honolulu Police Department]].<ref name="Kidd2012">{{cite book|author=R Spencer Kidd|title=UNIFORMS OF THE U.S. STATE POLICE & HIGHWAY PATROLS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TLDoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA33|date=November 23, 2012|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-4717-7729-5|pages=33–|access-date=April 30, 2020|archive-date=September 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200921094016/https://books.google.com/books?id=TLDoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA33&hl=en|url-status=live}}</ref>

Political organizations seeking some form of sovereignty for Hawaii have been active since the late 19th century. Generally, their focus is on [[self-determination]] and [[self-governance]], either for Hawaii as an independent nation (in many proposals, for "Hawaiian nationals" descended from subjects of the Hawaiian Kingdom or declaring themselves as such by choice), or for people of whole or part [[native Hawaiian]] ancestry in an indigenous "''nation to nation''" relationship akin to [[tribal sovereignty]] with [[US federal recognition of Native Hawaiians]]. The pro-federal recognition [[Akaka Bill]] drew substantial opposition among Hawaiian residents in the 2000s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/11/us/11hawaii.html|title=Hawaiians Weigh Options as Native-Status Bill Stalls|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 11, 2006|access-date=July 3, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703191002/https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/11/us/11hawaii.html|archive-date=July 3, 2018}}</ref><ref name="HIunpo">{{cite web|url=http://www.unpo.org/article/2089|title=Ka Lahui Hawaiʻi: Akaka Bill Has Plenty of Vocal Opposition|date=March 8, 2005|access-date=July 3, 2018|archive-date=September 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200921094016/https://www.unpo.org/article/2089|url-status=live}}</ref> Opponents to the tribal approach argue it is not a legitimate path to Hawaiian nationhood; they also argue that the U.S. government should not be involved in re-establishing Hawaiian sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web|author=Imani Altemus-Williams|date=December 7, 2015|url=https://intercontinentalcry.org/towards-hawaiian-independence|work=IC|publisher=Center for World Indigenous Studies|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703190909/https://intercontinentalcry.org/towards-hawaiian-independence|archive-date=July 3, 2018|title=Towards Hawaiian Independence: Native Americans warn Native Hawaiians of the dangers of Federal Recognition|access-date=July 3, 2018}}</ref><ref name="Perkins">{{cite magazine|author=ʻUmi Perkins|date=January 16, 2015|title=Is Hawaiʻi an Occupied State?|website=The Nation|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/hawaii-occupied-state/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180708074420/https://www.thenation.com/article/hawaii-occupied-state/|archive-date=July 8, 2018|access-date=July 7, 2018}}</ref>
