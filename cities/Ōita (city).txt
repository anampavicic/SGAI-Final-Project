==History==
The area of Ōita city was part of ancient [[Bungo Province]], and the location of the [[Bungo Kokubun-ji]] and presumably the Bungo ''[[kokufu]]'' were located in this area.  According to the [[Fudoki|''Bungo no Kuni Fudoki'']], the name ''Ōita'' was given by [[Emperor Keiko]] when he visited this area in the late [[Kofun period]]; however, the main urban center was the port of {{nihongo|Funai|府内}} on the coast. During the [[Kamakura period]], the [[Ōtomo clan]] was appointed ''[[shugo]]'' of the province, and made Funai their ''[[jōkamachi]]''. By the [[Sengoku period]], the Ōtomo has conquered most of Kyushu and had embraced [[Nanban trade|Nanban culture]], with Funai becoming a stronghold of the [[Kirishitan]] religion and western technology. However, the Ōtomo were destroyed by the [[Shimazu clan]] and after the establishment of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], their territories were divided, with Funai becoming the center of [[Funai Domain]] ruled by the [[Matsudaira clan|Ogyū-Matsudaira clan]]. 

The town of Ōita  was established on May 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system, and was raised to city status in 1911. On April 1, 1997, it was designated as a [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] with greater local autonomy.

On January 1, 2005, the town of [[Notsuharu, Ōita|Notsuharu]] (from [[Ōita District, Ōita|Ōita District]]) and the town of [[Saganoseki, Ōita|Saganoseki]] (from [[Kitaamabe District, Ōita|Kitaamabe District]]) were merged into Ōita.

==Government==
Ōita has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 44 members. Ōita contributes 13 members to the Ōita Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between the [[Ōita 1st district]] and [[Ōita 2nd district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

== Economy ==
{{Unreferencedsect|date=December 2023}}
During the 1960s and 1970s, an [[industrial region]] was formed along the Beppu Gulf coast. Among the plants in the region were flagship plants of [[Nippon Steel]] and [[Showa Denko]].

In the 1970s, [[Toshiba]] and [[Canon (company)|Canon]] built and expanded their plants in inland area. By then, the city emerged as a major production center of electronics products such as [[Integrated circuit#SSI, MSI, LSI|LSIs]] and [[digital camera]]s.

The downtown and shopping districts are located to the north of [[Oita Station]]. However, the area has been gradually declining because the main commercial areas have been dispersed due to the construction of big [[shopping mall]]s in the suburbs.
