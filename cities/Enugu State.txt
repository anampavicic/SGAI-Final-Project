'''Enugu State''' ({{lang-ig|Ȯra Enugu}}) verbally pronounced as "Enụgwụ" by the igbo indigenes is a [[States of Nigeria|state]] in the [[South East (Nigeria)|South-East geopolitical zone]] of [[Nigeria]], bordered to the north by the states of [[Benue State|Benue]] and [[Kogi State|Kogi]], [[Ebonyi State]] to the east and southeast, [[Abia State]] to the south, and [[Anambra State]] to the west. The state takes its name from its capital and largest city, [[Enugu]]. The city acquired township status in 1917 and was called Enugwu-Ngwo. Due to the rapid expansion towards areas owned by other indigenous communities, it was renamed Enugu in 1928.

Of the [[States of Nigeria|36 states]], Enugu is the [[List of Nigerian states by area|29th largest in area]] and [[List of Nigerian states by population|22nd most populous]] with an estimated population of over 4.4 million as of 2016.<ref>{{Cite web |last=State |first=Enugu |date=18 August 2015 |title=About Enugu state |url=https://www.enugustate.gov.ng/index.php/elements-devices/ |access-date=25 February 2022 |language=en-US |archive-date=20 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191020211110/https://www.enugustate.gov.ng/index.php/elements-devices/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Population 2006-2016 |url=https://nigerianstat.gov.ng/elibrary/read/474 |website=[[National Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria|National Bureau of Statistics]] |access-date=22 December 2021}}</ref> Geographically, the state is divided between the [[Niger Delta swamp forests]] in the far south and the drier [[Guinean forest–savanna mosaic]] with some savanna in the rest of the state. Other important geographical features are the [[Udi-Nsukka Plateau]] and [[Ekulu River]], which flows through the city of [[Enugu]].

Modern-day Enugu State has been inhabited for years by various ethnic groups, primarily the [[Igbo people]] with minorities of [[Idoma people|Idoma]] and [[Igala people|Igala]] peoples in Etteh Uno a community in Igbo Eze North Local Government Area. In the pre-colonial period, what is now Enugu State was a part of the medieval [[Kingdom of Nri]] and the [[Arochukwu]]-based [[Aro Confederacy]] before the latter was defeated in the early 1900s by British troops in the [[Anglo-Aro War]]. After the war, the British incorporated the area into the [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate]], which was later merged into [[British Nigeria]] in 1914; after the merger, Enugu became a symbol of anti-colonial resistance after the 1949 [[Iva Valley|massacre of striking coal miners]]<ref>{{Cite news |last=Onyeakagbu |first=Adaobi |date=12 April 2022 |title=Ever heard about the massacred souls that haunt Iva Valley in Enugu? |work=Pulse ng. |url=https://www.pulse.ng/lifestyle/food-travel/iva-valley-ever-heard-about-the-massacred-souls-that-haunt-enugu/vwkr4rr |access-date=26 June 2022}}</ref> in the [[Iva Valley]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Agunbiade |first1=Tayo |title=Remembering Margaret Ekpo and the Enugu strike massacre |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2020/12/12/remembering-margaret-ekpo-and-enugu-strike-massacre |website=[[Al Jazeera English|Al Jazeera]] |access-date=23 December 2021}}</ref>

After independence in 1960, the area of what is now Enugu was a part of the post-independence [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Region]] until May 1967 when the region was split and the area became part of the [[East Central State]]. Less than two months afterwards, the former Eastern Region attempted to secede in the three-year long [[Nigerian Civil War]] with what is now Enugu State as a part of the secessionist state of [[Biafra]]. The city of [[Enugu]] was named the Biafran capital until October 1967 when it was [[Fall of Enugu|captured]] by federal forces; the rest of the state was hard-fought over but much of it fell by June 1968. At the war's end and the reunification of Nigeria, the [[East Central State]] was reformed until 1976 when [[Anambra State]] (including what is now Enugu) was formed by the [[Murtala Muhammed]] regime. Fifteen years afterwards, Anambra State was divided with the eastern part being broken off to form the new Enugu State; in 1996, part of Enugu State's east was removed to form a part of the new [[Ebonyi State]].<ref>{{cite web |title=This is how the 36 states were created |url=https://www.pulse.ng/news/local/nigerian-states-this-is-how-the-36-states-were-created/mdtnq3e |website=Pulse.ng |date=24 October 2017 |access-date=15 December 2021}}</ref> 

Economically, Enugu State is based around [[trading]], [[manufacturing ]] mainly plastic manufacturing (but recently, China opened a factory called Dongfeng) and services along with agriculture, mainly of [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[rice]], [[cocoyam]], [[oil palm]], and [[cassava]]. A key minor industry was mining, especially of [[coal]] in the [[Udi Hills]] around the city of [[Enugu]]. Enugu State has the [[List of Nigerian states by Human Development Index#2019|tenth highest]] [[Human Development Index]] in the country and is considered the heart of [[Igboland]], the cultural region of ethnically [[Igbo people|Igbo]] areas.<ref>{{cite web |title=Human Development Indices |url=https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/shdi/ |website=Global Data Lab |access-date=15 December 2021}}</ref>

== Geography ==
Enugu State is one of the states in the eastern part of Nigeria located at the foot of the Udi Plateau. The state shares borders with [[Abia State]] for about 25 km to the south, [[Ebonyi State]] to the east, [[Benue State]] to the northeast for 84 km, [[Kogi State]] to the northwest for 112 km (70 miles) and [[Anambra State]] to the west for 139 km (86 miles).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Enugu {{!}} state, Nigeria {{!}} Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Enugu-state-Nigeria|access-date=16 February 2022|website=www.britannica.com|language=en}}</ref>

[[Enugu]], the capital city of Enugu State, is on the railroad from Port Harcourt, 150 miles (240&nbsp;km) south-southwest, and at the intersection of roads from Aba, Onitsha, and Abakaliki. It is approximately 4 hours drive away from [[Port Harcourt]], where coal shipments exited Nigeria. Enugu is also located within an hour's drive from [[Onitsha]], one of the biggest commercial cities in Africa and two hours' drive from [[Aba, Nigeria|Aba]], another very large commercial city, both of which are trading centres in Nigeria. The average temperature in this city is cooler to mild ~17°C (60°F) in its cooler months and gets warmer to hot in its warmer months ~28°C (upper 80°F).

Enugu has good soil-land and climatic conditions all year round, sitting at about {{convert|223|m|ft}} above sea level, and the soil is well drained during its rainy seasons. The mean temperature in Enugu State in the hottest month of February is about {{convert|87.16|F}}, while the lowest temperatures occur in the month of November, reaching {{convert|60.54|F}}. The lowest rainfall of about {{convert|0.16|cc|cuin|lk=on|}} is normal in February, while the highest is about {{convert|35.7|cc|cuin}} in July.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Enugu {{!}} state, Nigeria|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Enugu-state-Nigeria|access-date=15 June 2021|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
Enugu state has a Tropical wet and dry or savanna climate. The city's yearly temperature is 28.27°C (82.89°F) and it is -1.19% lower than Nigeria's averages. Enugu typically receives about 158.57 millimeters (6.24 inches) of precipitation and has 192.73 rainy days (52.8% of the time) annually.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Enugu, NG Climate Zone, Monthly Weather Averages and Historical Data |url=https://tcktcktck.org/nigeria/enugu |access-date=30 June 2023 |website=tcktcktck.org}}</ref>

== History ==
The name of the state was derived from its capital city, Enugu. The word "Enugu" (from ''Enu Ugwu'') means "the top of the hill". The first European settlers arrived in the area in 1909, led by a British mining engineer named [[Albert Ernest Kitson|Albert Kitson]]. In his quest for silver, he discovered coal in the Udi Ridge which is why the state is regarded as coal city state. The Colonial Governor of Nigeria [[Frederick Lugard]] took a keen interest in the discovery, and by 1914 the first shipment of coal was made to Britain. As mining activities increased in the area, a permanent cosmopolitan settlement emerged, supported by a railway system. Enugu acquired township status in 1917 and became strategic to British interests. Foreign businesses began to move into Enugu, the most notable of which were John Holt, Kingsway Stores, the British Bank of West Africa and the [[United Africa Company]].

From Enugu, the British administration was able to spread its influence over the Southern Province of Nigeria. The colonial past of Enugu is today evidenced by the Georgian building types and meandering narrow roads within the residential area originally reserved for the whites, an area which is today called the Government Reserved Area (GRA).

From being the capital of the Southern Provinces, Enugu became the capital of the Eastern Region (now divided into nine States), the capital of the now defunct Federal Republic of [[Biafra]], thereafter, the capital of East Central State, Anambra State, (old) Enugu State, and now the capital of the present Enugu State through a process of state creation and diffusion of administrative authority.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Enugu State |first=Government |date=2019 |title=About Enugu State.

== Politics ==
The State Government and the [[Local Government Areas of Nigeria|Local Government]] are the two levels of government in Enugu State and in all other [[states of Nigeria]]. [[Peter Mbah]] is the current executive governor of Enugu State. He was elected by the people in April 2023 and was sworn in on 29 May 2023<ref>{{Cite web |date=11 September 2021 |title=UN commends Ugwuanyi's investment in peace, security |url=https://guardian.ng/news/un-commends-ugwuanyis-investment-in-peace-security/|access-date=24 February 2022 |website=The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News |language=en-US}}</ref> [[Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi]] is the immediate past governor succeeding [[Sullivan Chime]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=29 May 2021 |title=Enugu: 22 years of unbroken democracy and Ugwuanyi's giant strides |url=https://guardian.ng/saturday-magazine/enugu-22-years-of-unbroken-democracy-and-ugwuanyis-giant-strides/ |access-date=28 February 2022 |website=The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News |language=en-US}}</ref> Chime was elected by the people of Enugu State in April 2007<ref>{{cite news |title=AC's argument on substitution of Enugu deputy governorship candidate |first=Uderi |last=Nwokwor |date=14 December 2007 |newspaper=The Daily Sun |publisher=Sun News}}</ref> and was sworn into office on 29 May 2007.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chime Avoids Workers Again |first=Emmanuel |last=Nzomiwu |date=4 May 2010 |newspaper=Daily Independent |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201005050238.html |access-date=3 September 2010}}</ref> The governor is above a group of commissioners who he has placed as heads of ministries that oversee various portfolios such as Health and Housing; both the governor and the commissioners form the Executive Council of Enugu State. Government House, Enugu is where the government of the state is based.

==Electoral system==

The electoral system of each state is selected using a modified two-round system. To be elected in the first round, a candidate must receive the plurality of the vote and over 25% of the vote in at least two -third of the State local government Areas. If no candidate passes threshold, a second round will be held between the top candidate and the next candidate to have received a plurality of votes in the highest number of local government areas.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://leadership.ng/2023-next-president-govs-must-get-two-thirds-spread-says-inec/ |title=Next President, Govs must get two thirds spread says INEC |newspaper=[[Leadership (newspaper)|Leadership]] |first1=Tunde |last1=Oguntola |date=27 September 2022}}</ref>

==Economy==
Economically, the state is predominantly rural and agrarian, with a substantial proportion of its working population engaged in farming, although trading (18.8%) and services (12.9%) are also important.<ref>{{Cite web |publisher=Enugu Coalition of Business Professional Association |date=2022 |title=About – Enugu Coalition Of Business and Professional Association |url=https://ecobpa.org/about/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Obodoechina |first=Okechukwu E. |date=February 2015 |title=Effectiveness of Direct Resource Delivery Policy to Crop Farmers: A Case of Fadama III Project in Enugu State, Nigeria |url=https://www.academia.edu/11229728 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20220627035325/https://www.academia.edu/11229728/Effectiveness_of_Direct_Resource_Delivery_Policy_to_Crop_Farmers_A_Case_of_Fadama_III_Project_in_Enugu_State_Nigeria |archive-date=27 June 2022 |url-status=live |journal=Global Advanced Research Journal of Management and Business Studies |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=49–60}}</ref> In the urban areas trading is the dominant occupation, followed by services. A small proportion of the population is also engaged in manufacturing activities, with the most pronounced among them located in Enugu, Oji, Ohebedim and Nsukka. The state boasts of a number of markets especially at each of the divisional headquarters, prominent of which is the Ogbete Main market in the State capital, Enugu. There is also one of the largest grains market East of the Niger, the Orie Orba Market which plays host to most farmers from the North Central States of Benue, Kogi, Nassarawa and Plateau who use the market to dispose their produce for consumers in South-East and South-Southern Nigeria. Every four days, grains and other farm produce are found in large quantities and at highly competitive prices.<ref>{{Cite web |last=South East Region Economic Development Company |date=2017 |title=Enugu State |url=https://southeast.ng/the-region/enugu-state/ |access-date=26 June 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Enugu State |url=http://southeast.ng/sendef/the-region/enugu-state/|access-date=25 February 2022 |website=SENDEF|date=16 March 2017 }}</ref>
==Natural resources==
The following Natural Resources are found in Enugu State:
* [[Coal]]<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018 |title=Nigerian Coal Corporation |url=https://www.bpe.gov.ng/nigerian-coal-corporation/ |url-status=}}</ref>

===Energy===
Electricity supply is relatively stable in Enugu and its environs. The Oji River Power Station (which used to supply electricity to all of Eastern Nigeria) is located in Enugu State. With the deregulation of electricity generation in Nigeria and the privatisation of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN), it is hoped the State Government would assist private investors to negotiate the take over and reactivation of the Oji Power Station. This is more so with the proximity of the Enugu coal mines to the power station, a driving distance of about 20 minutes. There are also traces of crude oil in Ugwuoba, in the same [[Oji-River]] Local Government area of the state. The state will also negotiate with investors interested in investing in the coal mining in Enugu.  The coal industry used to be one of the biggest employers of labour in the state and the state is looking to attract investors in the industry.

===Education===
Every community in Enugu State has at least one Primary/Elementary school and one Secondary school, funded and run by State Government. There are also large numbers of private nursery, primary and secondary schools in Enugu State.
