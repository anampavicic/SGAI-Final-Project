==History==

Fernando de la Mora used to be part of the district of [[San Lorenzo, Paraguay|San Lorenzo del Campo Grande]] and its population dedicated mostly to the farming activity. By then, it was called Zavala Cué and there were plantations of vegetables and fruit trees, as well as breeding of farm animals. This activity was oriented to satisfy the necessities of Asunción.

It was called Zavala Cué because in the area was settled an important state belonging a family of last name Zavala. This establishment was part of a group of 10 great states in the area.

The population of Zavala Cué kept growing and the authorities of San Lorenzo did not manifest interest in supporting the development of the city, which made the population very unhappy, so they decided to transform it into a competitive and progressive city.

Then, thanks to the neighbors' organization an independent municipality was created. The request was granted in 1939 by the government of [[Félix Paiva]], on February 28.
Since 1950, Fernando de la Mora is an independent district of the [[Central Department]], which now has 18 districts. This city is today called "The city of the new millennia".
