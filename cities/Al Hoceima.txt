'''Al Hoceima''' ({{langx|ar|الحسيمة}})<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.alhoceima.com/entreprise/histoire.html |title=Historique d'Al Hoceima (History of Alhoceima) |access-date=2018-04-17 |archive-date=2018-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226093219/http://www.alhoceima.com/entreprise/histoire.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> is a city in the north of [[Morocco]], on the northern edge of the [[Rif Mountains]] and on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean coast]]. It is the capital city of the [[Al Hoceima Province]]. The city is a known tourist destination despite its small size. It has a population of about 56,716, according to the [[2014 Moroccan census|2014 census]].<ref name=census2014/>

Al Hoceima is distinguished by its pristine sandy beaches such as [[Cala Iris Islet|Cala Iris]], [[Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera|Bades]], [[Quemado (Morocco)|Quemado]], and Tala Youssef, as well as its mountainous rocky terrain.

==Name==
Al Hoceima is an Arabised version of a Spanish word (Alhucemas – meaning 'Lavenders'), derived from the Andalusi Arabic term 'Al Khazama'."After independence, the Moroccan government established an Arabised name for Alhucemas coming up with Al Hoceima, following the standard French spelling.

==History==
===Early and colonial history===
The Ait Ouriaghel Berber tribe (also 'Beni Urriaguel') dominated the area around Al Hoceima. Abd el-Krim, whose father was a qadi of the Aith Yusuf clan, organized a guerilla force against the Spanish during the Rif War, establishing the Republic of the Rif in 1921. In September 1925, Spanish General José Sanjurjo landed at Al Hoceima and claimed the territory for Spain.
The Spanish developed the town and named it Villa Sanjurjo after General Sanjurjo. The first mayor was Florian Gómez Aroca.
----

===Since Moroccan independence===
[[File:ⵃⵓⵛⵉⵎⴰ ⴳⵉ ⴷⵊⵉⵔⵝ.jpg |thumb|300px|demonstration at Al Hoceima, 2017.]]
After Morocco gained its independence in 1955, Al Hoceima developed quickly, and the Moroccan government changed its name from the Spanish ''Villa Alhucemas'' to ''Al Hoceima''.

The years from 1956 to 1959 were marked by challenges for the Rif region. Morocco's [[Hassan II of Morocco|Hassan II]], then crown prince, assumed the role of military commander, and during this period, a significant number of people lost their lives in the [[Rif]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} In October 1958, the [[Beni Urriaguel]] community rebelled against the central administration, prompting the deployment of two-thirds of Morocco's army, led by Hassan, to Al Hoceima.<ref name=ellingham>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1mhFb_pA_w8C&pg=PA139 |pages=138–39, 150–53 |title=The Rough Guide to Morocco |first=Mark |last=Ellingham |publisher=Rough Guides |year=2001 |isbn=9781858286013}}</ref>

In the early 1950s and 1960s, during a period of economic hardship when many of the city's inhabitants were of modest means, the small houses in the city were predominantly painted white and blue. These colors, symbolizing the sea and sky, were commonly regarded as the city's official colors. As economic conditions improved over time, residents began to paint their houses in a wider range of colors.

The city and surrounding villages were hit by two large [[earthquake]]s within ten years. The first ({{M|w|link=y}} 6.0 event occurred on May 26, 1994,{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} and the second event ({{M|w}} 6.4) occurred on February 24, 2004,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YBw4eGjML48C&pg=PA51 |page=51 |title=Assessing and Managing Earthquake Risk: Geo-scientific and Engineering Knowledge for Earthquake Risk Mitigation: developments, tools, techniques |volume=2 |series=Geotechnical, Geological and Earthquake Engineering |editor1-first=Carlos Sousa |editor1-last=Oliveira |editor2-first=Antoni |editor2-last=Roca |editor3-first=Xavier |editor3-last=Goula |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |year=2007 |isbn=9781402036088}}</ref> killing more than 560 people (see [[2004 Al Hoceima earthquake]]). In 2007, Al Hoceima's mayor stated that all new houses would be painted white and blue in an effort to restore the city's traditional appearance.

Al Hoceima is now a moderate-size city with a population of 56,716 recorded in the [[2014 Moroccan census]].<ref name=census2014/> It has the second-largest port of the [[Rif]] region ([[Nador]] being the largest). The first schools built by the Spanish colonials, (a [[college]] and an [[elementary school]]) and a Spanish [[catholic]] church, still exist today.

Playa Quemado, where General Sanjurjo and his troops landed in 1925, is one of Al Hoceima's well-known beaches. Situated beneath the Mohammed V hotel, the beach is frequented by visitors. The hotel offers amenities such as a tennis court, restaurant, cocktail bar, and nightclub.

Al Hoceima has been the centre of repression by and political protest against the Moroccan government in the 21st century. Five young protesters were murdered, and their burned bodies found in Al Hoceima, in 2011.<ref name=nation/> On October 28, 2016, a fish-seller, Mouhcine Fikri, was crushed to death in a rubbish truck while trying to retrieve fish confiscated by the authorities,<ref name="eco" >{{cite news|title=Morocco's unrest is worsening|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21724804-cairotrouble-neglected-region-threatens-whole-country-moroccos-unrest|access-date=8 July 2017|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|date=6 July 2017}}</ref> which led to large anti-government protests in November 2016 known as [[Hirak Rif]].<ref name="bbcnewsmoroccoarrests">{{cite news|title=Morocco arrests 11 over fish-seller's death in Al-Hoceima|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-37835684|access-date=November 3, 2016|work=BBC|date=November 1, 2016}}</ref> Protests in Al Hoceima continued after the start of Ramadan, 26 May, and culminated on 26 June with "bloody clashes",<ref name=nation>{{cite news |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/is-morocco-headed-toward-insurrection/ |newspaper=[[The Nation]] |access-date=17 October 2020 |title=Is Morocco Headed Toward Insurrection? |first=Hisham |last=Aidi |date=13 July 2017}}</ref> then spreading to other parts of northern Morocco and the country.<ref name="eco" /> On 7 January 2023, A 5.3 Magnitude Earthquake hit Al Hoceima Province, [[Nekkour]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sahnouni |first=Mariya |title=5.3 Magnitude Earthquake Hits Morocco's Al Hoceima Province |url=https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2023/01/353417/5-3-magnitude-earthquake-hits-morocco-s-al-hoceima-province |access-date=2023-01-27 |website=moroccoworldnews |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=5.3 Magnitude Earthquake Hits Morocco's Al Hoceima Province |url=https://www.qna.org.qa/en/News-Area/News/2023-01/07/0013-53-magnitude-earthquake-hits-morocco%27s-al-hoceima-province |access-date=2023-01-27 |website=www.qna.org.qa |language=en}}</ref> On 12 February 2023, National Institute of Geophysics announced two earthquakes that occurred in the Al Hoceima region, in the north of the country, measuring 3.8 and 4.3 degrees.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The National Institute of Geophysics in Morocco: two earthquakes in the Al Hoceima region, in the north of the country, measuring 3.8 and 4.3 degrees |url=https://dearborn.org/preview/the-national-institute-of-geophysics-in-morocco-two-earthquakes-in-the-al-hoceima-region-in-the-north-of-the-country-measuring-38-and-43-degrees-23065 |access-date=2023-02-12 |website=dearborn.org |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-02-12 |title=Earthquake of 4.3 hits Al Hoceima province this morning |url=https://en.hespress.com/58541-earthquake-of-4-3-hits-al-hoceima-province-this-morning.html |access-date=2023-02-12 |website=HESPRESS English - Morocco News |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Aamari |first=Oussama |title=4.3 Magnitude Earthquake Hits Morocco's Al Hoceima Province |url=https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2023/02/353996/4-3-magnitude-earthquake-hits-moroccos-al-hoceima-province |access-date=2023-02-12 |website=moroccoworldnews |language=en}}</ref>
