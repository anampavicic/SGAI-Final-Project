'''Arica''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|r|i:|k|ə}} {{respell|ə|REE|kə}}; {{IPA|es|aˈɾika|lang}}) is a [[Communes of Chile|commune]] and a port city with a population of 222,619 in the [[Arica Province]] of northern [[Chile]]'s [[Arica y Parinacota Region]]. It is Chile's northernmost city, being located only {{convert|18|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the border with [[Peru]]. The city is the [[capital (political)|capital]] of both the Arica Province and the Arica and Parinacota Region. Arica is located at the [[orocline|bend]] of South America's western coast known as the Arica Bend or Arica Elbow. At the location of the city are two valleys that dissect the [[Atacama Desert]] converge: [[Azapa Valley|Azapa]] and [[Lluta River|Lluta]]. These valleys provide citrus and olives for export.<ref name="eb">{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Arica-Chile | title= Arica Chile|date=5 July 2018 |website= Britannica |access-date= 1 September 2022}}</ref>

Arica is an important port for a large inland region of South America. The city serves a [[free port]] for Bolivia and manages a substantial part of that country's trade.<ref name="eb" /> In addition it is the end station of the Bolivian [[oil pipeline]] beginning in [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]].<ref name="eb" /> The city's strategic position is enhanced by being next to the [[Chile Route 5|Pan-American Highway]], being connected to both [[Tacna]] in Peru and [[La Paz]] in Bolivia by railroad and being served by [[Chacalluta International Airport|an international airport]].

Arica has an [[Arica#Climate|extremely dry climate]], with almost no rainfall. Even so, the frequent maritime winds from the [[Humboldt Current|cold waters]] nearby renders a moderate desert climate. Its mild weather has made Arica known as the "city of the eternal spring" in Chile{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}} while its beaches are frequented by Bolivian society.<ref name="eb" /> The city was an important port already during [[Colonial Chile|Spanish colonial rule]]. Chile [[Battle of Arica|seized the city from Peru]] in 1880 during the [[War of the Pacific]], being recognized as Chilean by Peru [[Treaty of Lima (1929)|in 1929]]. A substantial part of [[African Chilean]]s live in or trace their origins to Arica.

==History==
Archaeological findings indicate that Arica was inhabited by different native groups dating back 10,000 years. These people are the first known culture to mummify their dead, predating the Egyptians by 2,000 years, and their mummies have been discovered as recently as 2004 and buried as shallow as <1 meter beneath the city's surface.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20220519-chiles-desert-town-built-on-mummies | title=The ancient mummies older than Egypt's |author=Riumalló, Juan Francisco |date=20 May 2020 |website= BBC |access-date= 1 September 2022}}</ref>

===Colonial period===
[[Spanish people|Spaniards]] settled the land under captain Lucas Martinez de Begazo in 1541, and in 1570, the area was grandly retitled as "La Muy Ilustre y Real Ciudad San Marcos de Arica" (the very illustrious and royal city of San Marcos of Arica). By 1545, Arica was the main export entrepot for Bolivian [[silver]] coming down from [[Potosí]], which then possessed the world's largest [[silver mine]]. Arica thus held a crucial role as one of the leading ports of the [[Spanish Empire]]. These enviable riches made Arica the target for [[pirate]]s, [[buccaneer]]s, and [[privateer]]s, among whom [[Francis Drake]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Drake|first1=Francis|title=The World Encompassed by Sir Francis Drake: being His Next Voyage to that to Nombre de Dios|pages=107–108}}</ref> [[Thomas Cavendish]], [[Richard Hawkins]], [[Joris van Spilbergen]], [[John Watling]], [[Baltazar de Cordes]], [[Bartholomew Sharp]], [[William Dampier]], and [[John Clipperton]] all took part in looting the city.

===Peruvian period (1821–1880)===
Following the collapse of Spanish rule, in 1821, Arica was part of the recently independent Peruvian Republic. The Peruvian Constitution of 1823 regards it as a province of the Department of [[Arequipa]]. In 1855, Peru inaugurated the Arica-[[Tacna]] railroad (53&nbsp;km long), one of the first in Latin America. The rail line still functions today.

[[File:Arica after the earthquake (1868).JPG|left|thumb|The 1868 earthquake devastated the city, leaving it in ruins under the [[Morro de Arica]].]]

The [[1868 Arica earthquake|earthquake of August 13, 1868]] struck near the city with an estimated magnitude of 8.0 to 9.0 Estimates on the death toll vary greatly, some estimates have the number at 25,000 to 70,000 people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/tsunamis/peru/ptsu_1868.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525062840/http://www.usc.edu/dept/tsunamis/peru/ptsu_1868.html|url-status=dead|title=The 1868 Arica Tsunami |archive-date=25 May 2011|accessdate=18 December 2022}}</ref> Others estimate that the population of Arica was less than 3,000 people and the death toll was around 300.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} It triggered a [[tsunami]], measurable across the Pacific in [[Hawaii]], Japan and New Zealand. As Arica lies very close to the [[subduction]] zone known as the [[Peru–Chile Trench]] where the [[Nazca Plate]] dives beneath the [[South American Plate]], the city is subject to [[megathrust earthquake]]s.

===Chilenization period (1880–1929)===
{{see also|Chilenization of Tacna, Arica and Tarapacá}}
[[File:Batalla de Arica.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of the [[Battle of Arica]], 7 June 1880]]
Chilean forces occupied the region following the [[War of the Pacific]]. The [[Treaty of Ancón]] in 1883 formally acceded the region to Chilean control. The 1929 Tacna-Arica compromise in the [[Treaty of Lima (1929)|Treaty of Lima]] subsequently restored [[Tacna]] to Peru but Arica remained part of Chile.

===Modern Arica (1929–present)===
In 1958, the Chilean Government established the "Junta de Adelanto de Arica" (Board of Development for Arica), which promulgated many tax incentives for the establishment of industries, such as vehicle assembly plants, a tax-free zone, and a casino, among others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=27344|title = Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional &#124; Ley Chile}}</ref>
Many car manufacturers opened plants in Arica, such as [[Citroën]], [[Peugeot]], [[Volvo]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors]], which produced the Chevrolet LUV pickup until 2008.

In 1975, together with Chile's new open economy policies, the "Junta de Adelanto de Arica" was abolished.

The Arica and Parinacota Region was created on October 8, 2007, under Law 20.175, promulgated on March 23, 2007, by President [[Michelle Bachelet]] in the city of Arica.

===Promel toxic waste dumpsite===
In 1984-1985, the Swedish metal company [[Boliden AB|Boliden Mineral AB]] paid a local mineral extracting company, Promel Ldta., 10 million SEK ($1.2 million, $3.15 million in 2021 dollars) to receive, treat and confine around 20,000 tonnes of smeltery sludge from Rönnskärsverken in Skellefteå, containing among other things high levels of lead, arsenic, cadmium, mercury and iron and smaller amounts of gold and silver. To earn additional income, Promel planned to extract various substances from the waste at its processing plant at Sitio F in the outskirts of Arica. The end products were mainly raw arsenic and iron-silver-gold oxides. The first shipment arrived in Arica in August 1984 and the processing of 500&nbsp;kg test batches in October 1984 gave positive results with oversight from an official from the Chilean Health Authority in [[Santiago]]. After the sludge processing had begun at large scale and the third and last shipment of sludge arrived to Promel's plant in Arica in July 1985, contact between Boliden and Promel ceased.

In the late 1980s, Promel ceased all activities at Sitio F for unknown reasons and abandoned the remaining 10,000 tons of the highly toxic smelting sludge out in the open exposed to the elements. The area surrounding the plant was later used by the local authorities to build state-sponsored social housing aimed at low-income families. No physical barrier between the former plant and the residential area existed at the time. Residents of the new neighborhood had no knowledge about the contents of the sludge at the site, which became used as a playground by children.

In the 1990s, many residents around the former plant began to show symptoms of lead and arsenic poisoning. In 1998, the Chilean authorities ordered Promel to move the toxic waste. Promel moved the sludge to a walled area on the other side of a nearby hill and covered the material with a plastic mat. It was supposed to be a temporary storage site, yet the material remains there to this day. Cleanup of the remaining parts of Sitio F finished as late as 2010. Even after the removal of the sludge, the health effects on the local population continue to be devastating. Almost 8,000 residents were tested for toxic substances in 2010. Of the 6600 people that got results back from the Chilean Health Authority, 12.9% showed arsenic in their urine samples. Studies have found very high rates of arsenic related lung cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer and skin cancer in the local population. Other health effects include non-cancerous heart and lung diseases and fertility problems such as low birth weights and spontaneous miscarriages.

In 2013, 796 Arica residents, including human rights defenders, started legal action in Sweden against Boliden. The Court of Appeal for Northern Norrland held that the claims of the victims were time limited, and the Swedish Supreme Court declined to hear the case.<ref>[https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=27147&LangID=E "Chile: Nearly 40 years on, still no remedy for victims of Swedish toxic waste – UN experts", 2021].

==Demography==
[[File:Morroarica2011.JPG|thumb|The [[morro de Arica]] is one of the major attractions in the city]]
According to the 2017 census by the [[National Statistics Institute (Chile)|National Statistics Institute]], Arica spans an area of {{convert|4799.4|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} and has 222,619 inhabitants (110,115 men and 112,504 women). The population grew by 20% (37,351 people) between the 2002 and 2017 censuses. Arica is home to 97.7% of the total population of the region.<ref name= "INE"/>

The population of Arica is made up of various long-established groups in the region, and other more recent arrivals settled at differing times. Among the long-established groups, the oldest consists of indigenous [[Indigenous peoples in Chile|Amerindians]], such as the [[Aymara people|Aymara]], whose presence in the region is of several millennia. These are followed by the second oldest, the local colonial-era groups, which includes local mestizos (of mixed Spanish-Amerindian origin), local criollos (whites of colonial Spanish origin), and local [[Afro-Chilean|afrodescendants]] of colonial-era slaves. The third oldest group consists of early post-colonial [[Chinese Chilean]]s who first arrived as miners and rail workers in the 1890s.

These long-established groups of Ariqueños have been augmented by various later settlers, mostly other criollos and mestizo Chileans from elsewhere around Chile, but also numerous Europeans, who arrived in the 1900s, including more Spaniards arriving from Spain, as well as Italians, Greeks, British, and French. These arrived at different times during the last century.

Some Ariqueños, primarily the indigenous Amerindians, but also the afro-descendants, share cultural affinities to counterpart populations in neighbouring border areas of Peru, and more distantly, Bolivia.

The urban area of Arica has 175,441 inhabitants in an area of 41.89&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Arica in 2007 had more than 185,000 inhabitants (not counting the inhabitants of the valleys and Lluta Azapa, with that reach almost to the 194.000 inhabitants). The growing city of Arica spreads outward into the desert and the Peru-Chile border. The Azapa Valley has developed a year-round agricultural economy due to improvements in irrigation and transportation of its products.

The villages that make up the commune are Villa Frontera and San Miguel de Azapa. Some hamlets are Poconchile, Molinas, Sora, Las Maitas and Caleta Vitor.

Arica was made famous in 1970 by the spiritual master [[Oscar Ichazo]] when he held a 10-month training there for 50 North Americans from the [[Esalen Institute]] in California.  The [[Arica School]], based in the United States of America, has influenced thousands of people all over the world.

The commune of Arica is composed of 19 census districts.

== Economics ==
Arica is the economical powerhouse of its region. It is an enormous trade and shipping point and vital for the maritimal access of [[Bolivia]].

==Features==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
{{see also|Morro de Arica|Arica–La Paz railway}}
The ''[[Morro de Arica]]'' is a tall, nearly-vertical rock formation and hill located in the city, situated approximately 139 meters above sea level. It was the last bulwark of defense for the Peruvian troops who garrisoned the city. It was [[Battle of Arica|attacked and captured]] on 7 June 1880 by Chilean troops, as the final effort of their ''Campaña del Desierto'' ([[Desert Campaign]]) during the [[War of the Pacific]].

Near to the city center is the [[Azapa Valley]], an [[oasis]] where vegetables and, famously, Azapa [[olives]] are grown. Economically, it is also an important port for Chilean [[ore]]. The [[semi-tropical]] latitude, combined with the low humidity and the city's beaches, have made Arica a popular tourist destination. It is also a center of Chilean [[rail transport|rail]] networks with [[Bolivia]]. For air travel, the region is serviced by [[Chacalluta International Airport]].

Arica has strong ties with the city of [[Tacna]], [[Perú]]. Many people cross the border daily as they travel between the two cities, partially due to the many services (for example, dentists, doctors, etc.) that are cheaper in Perú. Arica is connected to both Tacna and [[Arica–La Paz railway|to La Paz]] via separate railroad lines.

==Climate==

According to the [[Köppen Climate Classification]] system, Arica has a hot [[desert climate]], abbreviated "BWh" on climate maps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=60458&cityname=Arica,+Arica+And+Parinacota,+Chile&units=|title=Arica, Chile Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|accessdate=18 December 2022}}</ref> Unlike many other cities with arid climates, Arica seldom sees extreme temperatures throughout the course of the year and it is also relatively overcast.

[[File:Arica port (Jan. 2008).jpg|thumb|The port of Arica.]]
Passenger train services on the [[Arica–La Paz railway]] ceased in 1996, but as of 2017 there were proposals to restart services from Arica as a tourist attraction (and for freight).<ref>Newman, Ian Thomson (March 1, 2017). "[https://www.railjournal.com/in_depth/south-american-railway-reopens-with-goal-of-attracting-tourists-and-freight South American railway reopens with goal of attracting tourists and freight]". ''Rail Journal''.</ref>

In 2011, Chile announced plans to privatise the [[Port of Arica]]. These were opposed by Bolivia, as Arica is its main sea port.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.railpage.com.au/f-t11329691-s45.htm|title = Railpage}}</ref>
