'''Subic''', officially the '''Municipality of Subic''' ({{langx|ilo|Ili ti Subic}}; {{langx|tl|Bayan ng Subic}}, [[kapampangan language|Kapampangan]]: ''Balen ning Subic''), is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Zambales]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 111,912 people.{{PH census|current}}

It is located along the northern coast of [[Subic Bay]]. Portions of the town also form part of the [[Subic Special Economic and Freeport Zone]].

Subic is {{convert|66|km}} from [[Iba, Zambales|Iba]], {{convert|12|km}} from [[Olongapo]], and {{convert|138|km}} from [[Manila]].

==Etymology==
The native [[Zambales]] inhabitants called the area ''Hubek'', which means "head of a [[plough]]"; Spanish missionary priests mispronounced the name as ''Subiq''.<ref name="Now"/> By the time of the [[American Colonial Period (Philippines)|American occupation]], "Subiq" was mispronounced as ''Subig''. Eventually, the name reverted to "Subiq", but the letter 'q' was replaced with 'c'.

==History==
===Spanish colonial era===
In 1572, [[Juan de Salcedo]], the Mexico-born Spanish conquistador and grandson of [[Miguel Lopez de Legazpi]], founded Zambales during his exploration of northern Luzon.<ref name="Now">{{usurped|1=[https://web.archive.org/web/20111212194639/http://www.zambalesnow.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=75&Itemid=4&limitstart=4 "Municipalities"]}}. Zambales Now, Official Website of Zambales. Retrieved on 2012-05.24.<br>** The year of 1542 in the founding of Subic is a misprint and should be the year 1572 like in Botolan, for Salcedo was born in 1549.</ref> Subic was founded in late 1607 by Augustinian friars headed by Rev. Fr. Rodrigo de San Miguel, and the natives in Subic were Christianized under Spanish rule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://subic.gov.ph/?page_id=672|title=Official Website of Municipality of Subic, Province of Zambales » History of Subic|website=subic.gov.ph|access-date=November 8, 2016}}</ref>

In 1884 that declared Subic as "a naval port and the property appertaining there to set aside for naval purposes." Construction of an arsenal and ship repair yard ensued March 8 the following year, as ordered by the new settlers' Naval Commission. During the Philippine Revolution, a fleet led by the Cuban-Filipino Admiral [[Vicente Catalan]] seized the naval base at Subic from the Spanish for the [[First Philippine Republic]]. Subic Bay's potential as naval station was realized by the Americans. Commodore [[George Dewey]] and his men engaged in a battle that destroyed the Spanish Army in 1898, and the Americans took over Subic Bay on December 10, 1899.

===British invasion era===
In September 1762, the British invaded the Philippines and took over the Spanish main naval base in [[Manila Bay]].  This prompted the Spanish military to scout for the next promising naval station. The expedition returned with the good news for the naval command - a natural bounty and deep waters at Subic Bay. [[Alfonso XII of Spain|King Alfonso XII]] issued a decree<ref>an official order issued by a legal authority.</ref>

===American invasion era===
The Americans designated the Subic Bay area as a repair and supply naval base site in 1901. Two years later, US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] declared {{convert|283.27|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land in Subic as a military reservation area; or more than half of Subic's land area at the time.

===Japanese occupation era===
Subic, along with the Olongapo area suffered significant damage during the World War II and was repurposed by the Imperial Japanese Army as their own base during the Japanese occupation.<ref name=history>{{cite web |title=History of Subic |url=https://www.subic.gov.ph/about-subic/history-of-subic/ |publisher=Subic Municipal Government |access-date=June 3, 2021}}</ref>

===Philippine independence===
After World War II, [[Olongapo]], a barrio of Subic that forms part of the US Military Reservations in the Subic area, was turned over to the Philippine government. Olongapo was converted to a municipality independent from Subic town through Executive Order No. 366 issued by President [[Carlos P. Garcia]] on December 7, 1959.<ref name=history/>

==Geography==
=== Barangays ===
Subic is politically subdivided into 16 [[barangay]]s.{{PSGC detail|area}} Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].

The primary road that connects Subic to the other parts of the town is the Olongapo-Bugallon Road. Most of the names of Subic's streets are based on the surnames of prominent residents or names of plants. Most of the roads in Subic are made of concrete and asphalt while others are still made of dirt.

Bypass roads such as the Govic Highway are also commonly used by motorists to travel from Barangay Matain to Barangay Manggahan. The roads are meant to reduce traffic in the town proper and are used by trucks going north of Castillejos and vice versa.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

Another main road is the Philseco Road that ends from Barangay Asinan proper down to [[Keppel Shipyard|Seatrium Subic Shipyard]] (formerly Keppel Subic Shipyard and Philippine Shipyard and Engineering Corporation).{{citation needed|date=August 2022}} The Govic Highway Extension runs from Castillejos down to [[HHIC Phil|Hanjin Shipyard]] and is exclusively used by its workers.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}
