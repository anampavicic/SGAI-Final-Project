'''Fresno''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|r|ɛ|z|n|oʊ|audio=En-us-fresno.ogg}}; {{Langnf|es||[[Fraxinus|Ash]]}}) is a major city in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] of [[California]], United States. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Fresno County, California|Fresno County]] and the largest city in the greater [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] region. It covers about {{convert|115|sqmi|km2}} and had a population of 542,107 as of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], making it the [[List of largest California cities by population|fifth-most populous city in California]], the most populous inland city in California, and the [[List of United States cities by population|34th-most populous city]] in the nation.<ref name="QuickFacts"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab19.txt |title=Population of the 100 Largest Cities and Other Urban Places in the United States: 1790 TO 1990 |access-date=July 2, 2010 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725010358/https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab19.txt |archive-date=July 25, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="US-Gazetteer">{{Cite US Gazetteer|2010|places|CA}}</ref>

Named for the abundant ash trees lining the [[San Joaquin River]], Fresno was founded in 1872 as a railway station of the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] before it was [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1885. It has since become an economic hub of Fresno County and the San Joaquin Valley, with much of the surrounding areas in the [[Metropolitan Fresno]] region predominantly tied to large-scale agricultural production. Fresno is near the geographic center of California, approximately {{convert|220|mi|-1}} north of [[Los Angeles]], {{convert|170|mi|-1}} south of the state capital, [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], and {{convert|185|mi|-1}} southeast of [[San Francisco]]. [[Yosemite National Park]] is about {{convert|60|mi|km|-1}} to the north, [[Kings Canyon National Park]] {{convert|60|mi|km|-1}} to the east, and [[Sequoia National Park]] {{convert|75|mi|km|-1}} to the southeast.

==History==
{{For timeline}}
The original inhabitants of the [[San Joaquin Valley]] region were the [[Yokuts people]] and [[Miwok people]], who engaged in trading with other Californian tribes of Native Americans including coastal peoples such as the [[Chumash people|Chumash]] of the Central California coast, with whom they are thought to have traded plant and animal products.
[[File:Fresno County Courthouse (1885).jpg|thumb|left|The old [[Fresno County Courthouse]], built in 1875 and demolished in 1966]]
The first European to enter the San Joaquin Valley was [[Pedro Fages]] in 1772.<ref>Capace, Nancy (1999). ''Encyclopedia of California''. North American Book Dist LLC. Page 410. {{ISBN|9780403093182}}.</ref> The county of Fresno was formed in 1856 after the [[California Gold Rush]] and was named for the abundant ash trees (Spanish: fresno) lining the [[San Joaquin River]].

The San Joaquin River flooded on December 24, 1867, inundating [[Millerton, Madera County, California|Millerton]]. Some residents rebuilt, others moved. Flooding also destroyed the town of Scottsburg on the nearby [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]] that winter. Rebuilt on higher ground, Scottsburg was renamed Centerville.<ref name="CGN14">{{California's Geographic Names|1014-1015}}</ref>

In 1867, Anthony Easterby purchased land bounded by the present Chestnut, Belmont, Clovis and California avenues, that today is called the [[Sunnyside, Fresno County, California|Sunnyside district]]. Unable to grow wheat for lack of water, he hired sheep man Moses Church in 1870 to create an irrigation system.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fresno Irrigation District {{!}} Full History |url=https://www.fresnoirrigation.com/history-old |access-date=March 27, 2023 |website=Fresno Irrigation |language=en}}</ref> Building new canals and purchasing existing ditches, Church then formed the Fresno Canal and Irrigation Company, a predecessor of the Fresno Irrigation District.

In 1872, the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] established a station near Easterby's—by now a hugely productive wheat farm—for its new [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] line. Soon there was a store near the station and the store grew into the town of Fresno Station, later called Fresno. At that time, Mariposa street was the main artery, a rough dusty or muddy depression.<ref>{{cite book |last=Vandor |first=Paul E. |date=1919 |title=History of Fresno County, California, with biographical sketches of the leading men and women of the county who have been identified with its growth and development from the early days to the present. | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBk1AQAAMAAJ |location=Los Angeles, CA |publisher=Historic Record Company |quote=Mariposa Street, the main artery, was a rough depression}}</ref> Many Millerton residents, drawn by the convenience of the railroad and worried about flooding, moved to the new community. Fresno became an incorporated city in 1885. In 1903, the faltering San Joaquin Power Company was renamed the San Joaquin Light and Power Corporation and included the Fresno City Water Company and the Fresno City Railway.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Huntington Boulevard Historic District (Fresno, California) |url=http://historicfresno.org/districts/huntington/index.htm |access-date=March 5, 2023 |website=A Guide to Historic Architecture in Fresno, California |publisher=historicfresno.org}}</ref> By 1931 the railway, now known as the [[Fresno Traction Company]], operated 47 [[streetcar]]s over {{convert|49| miles}} of track.<ref name="hwd">{{cite book | author=Demoro, Harre W.| title=California's Electric Railways| publisher=[[Interurban Press]]|location=Glendale, California| year=1986| page=201| isbn=978-0-916374-74-7}}</ref>
[[File:Old Fresno High School (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Fresno High School]] in 1896]]

Two years after the station was established, county residents voted to move the county seat from Millerton to Fresno. When the [[Friant Dam]] was completed in 1944, the site of Millerton became inundated by the waters of [[Millerton Lake]]. In extreme droughts, when the reservoir shrinks, ruins of the original county seat can still be observed.

In the nineteenth century, with so much wooden construction and in the absence of sophisticated firefighting resources, fires often ravaged American frontier towns. The greatest of Fresno's early-day fires, in 1882, destroyed an entire block of the city. Another devastating blaze struck in 1883.

In 1909, Fresno's first and oldest [[synagogue]], [[Temple Beth Israel (Fresno, California)|Temple Beth Israel]], was founded.

As a result of its remoteness from the great universities of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and [[Greater Los Angeles]], Fresno became a statewide leader in educational innovation.  In 1910, [[Fresno High School]] was the first California high school to take advantage of the Upward Extension Act of 1907 to offer lower-division college-level coursework to local high school graduates who wanted to attend college but were reluctant to move hundreds of miles away to do so.<ref name="Boggs_Page_5">{{cite book |last1=Boggs |first1=George R. |editor1-last=Boggs |editor1-first=George R. |editor2-last=Galizio |editor2-first=Lawrence A. |title=A College for All Californians: A History of the California Community Colleges |date=2021 |publisher=Teachers College Press |location=New York |isbn=9780807779873 |pages=1–15 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4j5IEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA5 |chapter=Chapter 1: Beginnings}} (At p. 5.)</ref> The high school's Collegiate Department evolved into [[Fresno City College]], the oldest community college in California and the second oldest in the United States.<ref name="Boggs_Page_5" />  In the 1920s and 1930s, Fresno State Teachers College was at the forefront of the evolution of the state teachers colleges into state colleges offering a broad [[liberal arts education]].<ref name="Gerth7">{{cite book|last1=Gerth|first1=Donald R.|title=The People's University: A History of the California State University|date=2010|publisher=Berkeley Public Policy Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-87772-435-3|pages=23–24, 33–35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v4J-QwAACAAJ&q=liberal%20arts%20mclane}}</ref>  The state colleges later became the [[California State University]] and Fresno State became [[California State University, Fresno]].

Fresno entered the ranks of the 100 most populous cities in the United States in 1960 with a population of 134,000.

The [[Fresno Sanitary Landfill|Fresno Municipal Sanitary Landfill]] was the first modern [[landfill]] in the United States, and incorporated several important innovations to waste disposal, including trenching, compacting, and the daily covering of trash with dirt. It was opened in 1937 and closed in 1987.

Before World War II, Fresno had many ethnic neighborhoods, including Little Armenia, German Town, Little Italy, and [[History of Chinese Americans in Fresno#Fresno Chinatown|Chinatown]]. In 1940, the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] reported Fresno's population as 94.0% white, 3.3% black and 2.7% Asian.<ref name="census"/> Chinatown was primarily a Japanese neighborhood and today few Japanese-American businesses remain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wpr.org/derailed/high-speed-rail-debate-persists-california|title=The High-Speed Rail Debate Persists In California|last1=Bowden|first1=Bridgit|last2=Johnson|first2=Shawn|date=September 18, 2019|work=Wisconsin Public Radio|language=en|url-status=live|access-date=November 14, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105083718/https://www.wpr.org/derailed/high-speed-rail-debate-persists-california|archive-date=November 5, 2019}}</ref> During 1942, [[Pinedale, California|Pinedale]], in what is now North Fresno, was the site of the [[Pinedale, California|Pinedale Assembly Center]], an interim facility for the relocation of Fresno area [[Japanese Americans]] to [[Japanese American internment|internment camps]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/anthropology74/ce16e.htm | title=Pinedale Assembly Center, California | publisher=U.S. National Park Service | access-date=April 23, 2007 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407163302/http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/anthropology74/ce16e.htm | archive-date=April 7, 2007}}</ref> The [[Fresno Fairgrounds]] were also utilized as an assembly center.

Row crops and orchards gave way to urban development particularly in the period after World War II; this transition was particularly vividly demonstrated in locations such as the [[Blackstone Avenue]] corridor.

Fresno's geographical remoteness also made it an early pioneer in the field now known as [[fintech]], long before the term was invented.  In September 1958, [[Bank of America]] launched a new product called [[Visa Inc.#History|BankAmericard]] in Fresno. The city was specifically selected in part for its remoteness, to limit damage to the bank's image in case the project failed.<ref name="Nocera_Page_25">{{cite book |last1=Nocera |first1=Joseph |title=A Piece of the Action: How the Middle Class Joined the Money Class |date=1994 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=9781476744896 |page=25 |edition=2013 paperback |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mZ5FAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA25 |access-date=March 20, 2023 |archive-date=March 28, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230328155223/https://books.google.com/books?id=mZ5FAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA25 |url-status=live }}</ref>  After a troubled gestation during which its creator resigned, BankAmericard went on to become the world's first successful [[credit card]].

In 1970, BankAmericard was spun off into a separate company, and in 1976, that company became [[Visa Inc.]]

In the 1960s, Fresno suffered numerous demolitions of historic buildings, including the old [[Fresno County Courthouse]] and the original buildings of [[Edison High School (Fresno, California)|Edison High School]]. This was the result of car-centric urban planning focused on making more room for cars and parking lots, a commonplace approach in the United States at that time.

In 1995, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s [[Operation Rezone]] sting resulted in several prominent Fresno and [[Clovis, California|Clovis]] politicians being charged in connection with taking bribes in return for [[zoning|rezoning]] farmland for housing developments. Before the sting brought a halt to it, housing developers could buy farmland cheaply, pay off council members to have it rezoned, and make a large profit building and selling inexpensive housing. Sixteen people were eventually convicted as a result of the sting.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.fresnobee.com/columnists/boren/story/5599730p-6576567c.html | title=Lessons learned from Rezone can't be forgotten | newspaper=The Fresno Bee | author=Jim Boren | date=December 12, 2002 | access-date=April 23, 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20021228095048/http://fresnobee.com/columnists/boren/story/5599730p-6576567c.html |archive-date = December 28, 2002|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the early 2000s, Fresno's two major venues were built, [[Chukchansi Park]] (2002) and [[Save Mart Center]] (2003). The [[2017 Fresno shootings]] resulted in the death of 4 people.

==Geography==
[[File:Downtown Fresno, California (21385604348).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Aerial view of Fresno]]
Fresno has a total area of {{convert|116|sqmi|km2}} with 98.96% land covering {{convert|114.79|sqmi|km2}}, and 1.04% water, {{convert|1.21|sqmi|km2}}.

Fresno's location, very near the geographical center of California, places the city a comfortable distance from many of the major recreation areas and urban centers in the state. Just {{convert|60|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Yosemite National Park]], it is the nearest major city to the park. Likewise, [[Sierra National Forest]] is {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}}, [[Kings Canyon National Park]] is {{convert|60|mi|km|abbr=on}} and [[Sequoia National Park]] is {{convert|75|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The city is located near several [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] lakes including [[Bass Lake, California|Bass Lake]], [[Shaver Lake]], and [[Huntington Lake]]. Fresno is also only two and a half hours from [[Monterey]], [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel]], [[Big Sur]] and the central coast.

Because Fresno sits at the junction of Highways [[California State Route 41|41]] and [[California State Route 99|99]] (SR 41 is Yosemite National Park's southern access road, and SR 99 bypasses [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] to serve the urban centers of the San Joaquin Valley), the city is a major gateway for Yosemite visitors coming from [[Los Angeles]]. The city also serves as an entrance into Sierra National Forest via Highway [[California State Route 168|168]], and Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks via Highway [[California State Route 180|180]].

Fresno has three large public parks, two in the city limits and one in county land to the southwest. [[Woodward Park (Fresno)|Woodward Park]], which features the [[Shinzen Young|Shinzen]] [[Japanese Garden]]s, boasts numerous picnic areas and several miles of trails. It is in North Fresno and is adjacent to the [[San Joaquin River Parkway]]. [[Roeding Park]], near Downtown Fresno, is home to the [[Fresno Chaffee Zoo]], and Rotary Storyland and [[Playland (Fresno)|Playland]]. [[Kearney Park (Fresno)|Kearney Park]] is the largest of the Fresno region's park system and is home to historic Kearney Mansion and plays host to the annual Civil War Revisited, the largest reenactment of the Civil War in the west coast of the U.S.<ref>{{cite news

====Tower District====
[[File:Tower Theater (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The historic [[Tower Theatre (Fresno, California)|Tower Theatre for the Performing Arts]], built in 1939]]
The historic [[Tower Theatre (Fresno, California)|Tower Theatre]], which is included on the National Register of Historic Places,<ref>{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref> is the center of the Tower District. The theater was built in 1939 at the corner of Olive and Wishon Avenues. The Tower District neighborhood is just north of downtown Fresno proper, and one-half mile south of Fresno City College.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tower2000.com/history/index.html |title=Fresno's Historic Tower Theatre |website=Tower2000.com |access-date=July 2, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528112034/http://www.tower2000.com/history/index.html |archive-date=May 28, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> Although the neighborhood was known as a residential area, the early commercial establishments of the Tower District began with small shops and services that flocked to the area shortly after World War II. The character of small local businesses largely remains today. To some extent, the businesses of the Tower District were developed due to the proximity of the original Fresno Normal School (later renamed [[California State University, Fresno|California State University at Fresno]]). In 1916, the college moved to what is now the site of [[Fresno City College]] one-half mile north<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oabalegacyrenewed.com/history.html |title=The Old Administration Building at Fresno City College: A Legacy Renewed |website=Oabalegacyrenewed.com |access-date=July 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820021132/http://www.oabalegacyrenewed.com/history.html |archive-date=August 20, 2008}}</ref> of the Tower District.

After decades of neglect and suburban flight, the neighborhood revival followed the re-opening of the Tower Theatre in the late 1970s, which at that time showed second- and third-run movies, along with classic films. Roger Rocka's Dinner Theater & [[Good Company Players]] also opened nearby in 1978,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerrockas.com/good-company-players/|title=Roger Rocka's Dinner Theater|access-date=August 8, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808070522/http://rogerrockas.com/good-company-players/|archive-date=August 8, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> at Olive and Wishon Avenues. Fresno native [[Audra McDonald]] performed in the leading roles of Evita and The Wiz at the theater while she was a high school student. McDonald subsequently became a leading performer on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in New York City and a [[Tony Award|Tony award]]-winning actress. Also in the Tower District is Good Company Players' 2nd Space Theatre.
[[File:FresnoCC-Library (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|The main library at [[Fresno City College|City College]] was built in 1933.]]
The Tower District is a hub for community events such as Jamaica My Weekend, Mardi Gras in February, [[Pride parade|Gay Pride Parade]], car shows, A Taste of The Tower, Halloween in the Tower, the [[Farmers' market]] opened on the northwest corner of Olive and Van Ness and LitHop, an annual literary festival, featuring mostly local writers.

The neighborhood features restaurants, live theater and nightclubs, as well as several independent shops and bookstores on or near Olive Avenue. Since renewal, the Tower District has become an attractive area for restaurant and other local businesses. The Tower District is known as the center of Fresno's [[LGBT]] and [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] communities.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://collegian.csufresno.edu/2007/04/24/remembering-the-life-of-a-corporate-sellout/ |title=The Collegian » Remembering the life of a 'corporate sellout'<!-- Bot generated title --> |date=April 25, 2007 |access-date=January 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325140750/http://collegian.csufresno.edu/2007/04/24/remembering-the-life-of-a-corporate-sellout/ |archive-date=March 25, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The area is also known for its early twentieth century homes, many of which have been restored in recent decades. The area includes many [[California Bungalow]] and [[American Craftsman]] style homes, [[Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture]], [[Mediterranean Revival Style architecture]], [[Mission Revival Style architecture]], and many [[Storybook house]]s designed by Fresno architects, Hilliard, Taylor & Wheeler.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}} The residential architecture of the Tower District contrasts with the newer areas of tract homes [[urban sprawl]] in north and east areas of Fresno.

In the northeastern part of Fresno, [[Woodward Park (Fresno)|Woodward Park]] was founded by the late Ralph Woodward, a long-time Fresno resident. He bequeathed a major portion of his estate in 1968 to provide a regional park and [[bird sanctuary]] in Northeast Fresno. The park lies on the southern bank of the San Joaquin River between Highway 41 and Friant Road.

The park has a multi-use [[amphitheatre]] that seats up to 2,500 people, an authentic Japanese Garden, fenced dog park, bike park, two playgrounds, two-mile (3&nbsp;km) equestrian trail, exercise par course, three children's playgrounds, a lake, three small ponds, seven picnic areas, and five miles (8&nbsp;km) of multipurpose trails that are part of the San Joaquin River Parkway's Lewis S. Eaton Trail. When complete, the Lewis S. Eaton trail system will cover {{convert|22|mi|km}} between Highway 99 and Friant Dam. The park's amphitheatre was renovated in 2010, and has hosted performances by acts such as [[Deftones]], [[Tech N9ne]], and [[Sevendust]] as well as numerous others.

====Fig Garden====
Located in the western portion of Fresno, [[Old Fig Garden]] is an unincorporated community that, over time, has been completely encircled by the city of Fresno. Fig Garden was created in 1947, as the then-known Fig Garden Men's club achieved nonprofit corporate status, allowing itself to have much more governance.<ref name="Fig garden mission">{{cite web |title=Fig garden mission |url=https://www.oldfig.org/info |website=Oldfig.org}}</ref>

In 1979, the name was changed to Fig Garden Home Owners Association.<ref name="Fig garden mission"/> Fig Garden is unique to the rest of Fresno, as it features largely no sidewalks and is lined with various large trees. The homes are well-maintained and landscaped due to strict regulations from the homeowners association. Due to a tax Fig Garden residences voted for, there is nearly round-the-clock sheriff service within the district.<ref name="Fig garden mission"/> The district hosts the Fig Garden Christmas Tree Lane, which is a nationally recognized event.<ref>{{cite web |title=Christmas Tree Lane |url=https://www.christmastreelane.com/?v=f24485ae434a |website=Christmas Tree Lane |access-date=May 19, 2022}}</ref> There is also an upscale swim and racquet club located in northwestern Fig garden, which has multiple amenities including a heated lap pool, massage therapy, daycare, etc.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fig Garden Swim Club |url=https://www.fig-garden.com/ |website=Fig Garden Swim and Racquet club |access-date=May 19, 2022}}</ref> Towards the northern boundary there is a shopping center called Fig Garden Village which hosts a plethora of upscale shopping opportunities.<ref>{{cite web |title=fig Garden Village |url=https://www.shopfiggardenvillage.com/en.html |website=Fig Garden Village |access-date=May 19, 2022}}</ref>

==Government==
[[File:Fresno City Hall Nima1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Fresno City Hall]], designed by architect [[Arthur Erickson]] and completed in 1991]]
{{see also|Government of Fresno County, California}}
Fresno has a [[strong-mayor]] form of government. The mayor (executive branch) is directly elected and the seven city council members (legislative branch) are elected by district with no "at-large" seats. The mayor and council members are elected for no more than two 4-year terms. The mayor's office and council positions are officially nonpartisan and not affiliated with any political party. The current mayor is [[Jerry Dyer]], who is a [[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republican]].

===City Council===
{{div col}}

*District 2 - Mike Karbassi (Council Vice President)
*District 3 - Miguel Arias
*District 4 - Tyler Maxwell
*District 5 - Luis Chavez
*District 6 - Garry Bredefeld
*District 7 - Nelson Esparza
{{div col end}}
Prior to 1901, Fresno's government was under a [[Ward (electoral subdivision)|ward]] system which allowed for a board of trustees. From the trustees elected by the city wards, a president of the board of trustees would act as [[ex officio member|ex-officio]] mayor however did not hold the title of mayor. Because of this, the President of the board of trustees is not recognized as mayors of the City of Fresno.

Fresno is the county seat of Fresno County. It maintains the main county courthouse on Van Ness in the Fresno County Plaza for criminal and some civil court cases.

The [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of California|United States District Court, Eastern District of California]], has one of its six divisions based in the [[Robert E. Coyle]] Courthouse. The new courthouse replaced the [[B.F. Sisk]] Federal Building in 2006 because it did not have enough space for the growing Fresno Division. After extensive renovation, the building reopened in November 2010 as the B.F. Sisk Courthouse serving the [[California superior courts|Fresno County Superior Court]].

Fresno is also the seat of the [[California Courts of Appeal|Court of Appeal for the Fifth Appellate District]], for which a new courthouse was built in 2007 in the old Armenian Town section of downtown Fresno across from the Fresno Convention Center. The Fifth District Court of Appeal's courthouse was formally dedicated as the George N. Zenovich Building, after former [[state senator]] and [[associate justice]] of the Fifth District, [[George N. Zenovich]].
