==City emblem==
Hirosaki uses a Buddhist ''manji'' as its official emblem. This came from the flag emblem of [[Tsugaru clan]], the ''[[daimyō]]'' of [[Hirosaki Domain]] during the [[Edo period]].

==History==
Many human-shaped clay figures have been unearthed around the region which date as far back as 12,000 years. More of these figures date from the [[Jōmon period|Jomon]] and [[Yayoi period|Yayoi]] period.<ref>{{Cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul|location=Chicago|pages=345|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert}}</ref>

The area around Hirosaki formed part of the domains of the [[Northern Fujiwara]] in the [[Heian period]]; [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] awarded it to the [[Nanbu clan]] in the early [[Kamakura period]] after the defeat of the Northern Fujiwara (1189). During the [[Sengoku period]] a local retainer of the Nambu, [[Tsugaru Tamenobu|Ōura Tamenobu]], declared his independence (1571) and seized local castles. He pledged fealty to [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] at the [[Siege of Odawara (1590)|Battle of Odawara]] in 1590, and was confirmed in his holdings with revenues of 45,000 ''koku''. He also changed his name to "Tsugaru". After siding with [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]], he was re-confirmed in his holdings with a nominal ''[[kokudaka]]'' of 47,000 ''[[koku]]'' and he began construction of a castle in Takaoka (present-day Hirosaki). This marked the start of [[Hirosaki Domain]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. His successor, [[Tsugaru Nobuhira]], completed the castle in 1611, but its massive 5-story ''[[tenshu]]'' was lost to lightning in 1627. The domain's ''kokudaka'' increased to 100,000 ''koku'' in 1628.

The Tsugaru clan sided with the [[Satchō Alliance]] in the [[Boshin War]] of the [[Meiji Restoration]], and was rewarded by the new [[Meiji government]] with an additional 10,000 ''koku''. However, with the [[abolition of the han system]] on August 29, 1871, Hirosaki Domain was abolished, and replaced by Hirosaki Prefecture. The prefecture was renamed Aomori Prefecture in October of the same year, and the prefectural capital was relocated to the more centrally located [[Aomori, Aomori|Aomori]].

Chōyō Elementary School was established on October 1, 1873. Apple [[horticulture]] was introduced to Hirosaki from 1877 and the 59th National Bank, the predecessor of [[Aomori Bank]] opened in March 1878. Hirosaki was proclaimed a city on April 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system and was thus one of the first 30 cities in Japan. It was also the third largest city in the [[Tōhoku region]] after [[Sendai]] and [[Morioka]] at the time. The [[Ōu Main Line]] connected Hirosaki with Aomori on December 1, 1894.

Hirosaki became the home garrison town for the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]'s [[IJA 8th Division]] from October, 1898. The division was prominently active in the [[Russo-Japanese War]].

Hirosaki City Hospital was established in 1901, and Hirosaki City Library in 1906. The first telephone service in the city stated from 1909. The first Cherry Blossom Festival was held in 1918. In 1927, the [[Kōnan Railway]] connected Hirosaki with [[Tsugaru-Onoe Station|Onoe]]. [[Hirosaki University]] was established in 1949.

On March 1, 1955, Hirosaki expanded through annexation of neighboring villages of Shimizu, Wattoku, Toyoda, Horikoshi, Chitose, Fujishiro, Niina, Funazawa, Takasugi, Susono and Higashimeya. [[Nishimeya, Aomori|Nishimeya]] became an [[Enclave and exclave#True enclaves|enclave]]. The city further expanded on September 1, 1957, through annexation of neighboring Ishikawa Village.

In 1979, the city was connected to the [[Tōhoku Expressway]] by a spur road named "Apple Road".

On February 27, 2006, old Hirosaki city, the town of [[Iwaki, Aomori|Iwaki]], and the village of [[Sōma, Aomori|Sōma]] were merged into an expanded city of Hirosaki.<ref>{{Cite web |title=総務省｜令和2年版　地方財政白書｜資料編　〔附属資料〕　昭和60年度以降の市町村合併の実績 |trans-title=Record of Municipal Mergers Since Showa 60 |url=https://www.soumu.go.jp/menu_seisaku/hakusyo/chihou/32data/2020data/r02czs05-03.html |access-date=2024-02-28 |website=総務省 |language=ja}}</ref>

In 2012, the city began partnering with the French commune of [[Beuvron-en-Auge]] in the [[Pays d'Auge]] region of Normandy, which has been granted ''[[Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée|appellation contrôlée]]'' status for its [[cider]] and [[calvados (spirit)|calvados]] brandy made from cider. The partnership aims to promote economic and touristic development by creating opportunities related to apples.<ref>{{cite web|URL=https://www.ouest-france.fr/normandie/beuvron-en-auge-14430/cidre-beuvron-le-japon-sinspire-du-pays-dauge-3749620 |language=FR |title=Le Japon s’inspire du pays d’Auge |trans-title=Japan inspired by the Pays d'Auge |date=8 October 2015 |access-date=13 July 2023 |publisher=Ouest France}}</ref>

==Government==
Hirosaki has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 28 members. The city, together with the neighbouring village of Nishimeya, contributes six members to the Aomori Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Aomori 3rd district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Hirosaki is the regional commercial center for southwest Aomori Prefecture. The main agricultural crops include apples and rice, with Hirosaki accounting for 20% of the total production of apples in Japan.{{cn|date=June 2024}}
