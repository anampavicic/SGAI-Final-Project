Balikpapan was originally a fishing village built by [[Buginese people]] in the 19th century. The first oil drilling began in Balikpapan on 10 February 1897, which was later set as the anniversary of the city. In 1899, the [[Dutch East Indies]] colonial administration granted a township status to Balikpapan. In 1907, ''[[Bataafse Petroleum Maatschappij|Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij]]'' (BPM) made the city as its headquarters and imported skilled laborers, engineers, and managers from overseas. Subsequently, numerous multi-national companies came to Balikpapan to invest in the oil industry. This resulted in the economic boom of Balikpapan and attracted many migrants and expatriates.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f9T74ges6DIC|title=East Kalimantan: The Decline of a Commercial Aristocracy|last=Magenda|first=Burhan Djabier|date=2010|publisher=Equinox Publishing|isbn=9786028397216|access-date=18 August 2019|archive-date=26 February 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220226032922/https://books.google.com/books?id=f9T74ges6DIC|url-status=live}}</ref>

During [[World War II]], the [[Empire of Japan]] occupied the city in 1942, as part of the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|occupation of the Dutch East Indies]], and it was bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in [[Battle of Balikpapan (1942)|first Balikpapan Battle in 1942]] and [[Battle of Balikpapan (1945)|second battle in 1945]]. The battles impacted critical infrastructure, including the oil refinery stations and seaport which were completely burned to the ground. Upon Indonesia's independence, BPM extended its activities in Balikpapan until 1965 when [[Pertamina]], the Indonesian state-owned oil company, took control over the ownership of BPM and its oil exploration activities.<ref name=":0" />

==Etymology and nicknames==
There are several popular stories and legends explaining the origin of Balikpapan:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_Hd5Ki6NrwC&pg=PA8|title=Cerita rakyat dari Kalimantan Timur|last=Maula|first=Amiruddin|date=1994|publisher=Grasindo|isbn=9789795533962|language=id|access-date=26 February 2022|archive-date=26 February 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220226032921/https://books.google.com/books?id=1_Hd5Ki6NrwC&pg=PA8|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://ceritarakyatnusantara.com/id/folklore/306-Asal-Mula-Nama-Kota-Balikpapan-#|title=Etymology of Balikpapan|website=ceritarakyatnusantara.com|language=id|access-date=2019-01-25|archive-date=26 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190126060829/http://ceritarakyatnusantara.com/id/folklore/306-Asal-Mula-Nama-Kota-Balikpapan-|url-status=live}}</ref>

* The 10 pieces of board returned to Jenebora from the 1,000 pieces requested by the Sultan of Kutai as donations of building materials for the construction of the New Kutai Palace. The ten boards that were returned were referred to by the people of Kutai as Balikpapan Tu. So that the area along Balikpapan Bay, precisely in Jenebora is called Balikpapan.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=caXaPOWIHZ4C|title=Kumpulan Kisah Nyata Hantu di 13 Kota|last=Wikanjati|first=Argo|date=2010|publisher=Penerbit Narasi|isbn=9789791682145|language=id|access-date=18 August 2019|archive-date=26 February 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220226032923/https://books.google.com/books?id=caXaPOWIHZ4C|url-status=live}}</ref>
* Tribe of Pasir Balik (native people of Balikpapan) is a descendant of grandfather and grandmother named Kayun Kuleng and Papan Ayun. So that the area along Balikpapan Bay by its descendants is called ''Kuleng-Papan'' or means Balikpapan (in Paser, ''Kuleng'' means ''Balik'').<ref name=":1" />
* In other legends it is also mentioned the origin of Balikpapan, namely from a daughter who was released by her father a king who did not want his daughter to fall into the hands of the enemy. The daughter who was still a toddler was tied up on several pieces of board in a state of lying. Because it was carried away and hit by waves, the board was reversed. When the board was stranded on the shore found by a fisherman and so it turned out that there was a daughter who was still bound. It is said that the princess was named Putri Petung who came from the Kingdom of Sand. So that the area where it was found was called Balikpapan.<ref name=":1" />

The city has had several nicknames throughout its history such as the Oil City, City of Believers (''Kota Beriman''), which uniquely "BERIMAN" word is acronym from: ''BERsih'' (clean), ''Indah'' (magnificent), dan ''nyaMAN'' (comfortable).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://balikpapan.go.id/read/47/moto-dan-lambang-daerah|title=Balikpapan motto and seal|website=balikpapan.go.id|language=id|access-date=2019-01-25|archive-date=26 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190126001108/http://balikpapan.go.id/read/47/moto-dan-lambang-daerah|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Gezicht over de Baai van Balikpapan met olietanks en steigers van de Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij (BPM) TMnr 60018714.jpg|left|thumb|[[Bataafse Petroleum Maatschappij|Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij]] oil refinery, 1910s]]
{{unreferencedsect|date=September 2024}}
Before the oil boom of the early 1900s, Balikpapan was an isolated [[Bugis]] fishing village. Balikpapan's [[Toponymy|toponym]] (''balik'' = "behind" and ''papan'' = "plank") is from a folk story in which a local king threw his newborn daughter into the sea to protect her from his enemies. The baby was tied beneath some planks that were discovered by a fisherman. An alternative story is that, at the time of the Kutai sultanate, Sultan Muhammad Idris sent 1000 planks to aid the Paser Kingdom to build a new palace. The planks were shipped from Kutai to Paser along the Borneo shoreline by roping all the planks together. 10 out of the 1000 planks that were originally shipped resurfaced in a place currently called Balikpapan.

[[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) intelligence determined that half of all lubricating oils used by the Japanese military and 60 percent of all their aviation fuel came from refineries in Balikpapan, and it was therefore an extremely important target.{{cn|date=September 2024}} The American 380th Bombardment Group under the command of the RAAF, including the famous [[B-24 Liberator]] [[Shady Lady (aircraft)|''Shady Lady'']], attacked the oil refineries in August 1943 from [[Darwin, Australia]].

In September and October 1944, the [[Fifth Air Force|5th]] and [[Thirteenth Air Force|13th]] Air Forces under the command of General [[George Kenney]] launched a series of five raids from [[Morotai]] and  [[Noemfoor]] Islands.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bunnell |first1=John G. |title=Knockout Blow?

The [[Battle of Balikpapan (1945)|1945 Battle of Balikpapan]] concluded the [[Borneo Campaign (1945)|Borneo campaign]] and Allied forces took control of Borneo island. Extensive wartime damage curtailed almost all oil production in the area until [[Royal Dutch Shell]] completed major repairs in 1950.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

===CIA air raid===
In 1958, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] attacked Balikpapan and stopped oil exports. The US was running a CIA [[covert mission]] to undermine President [[Sukarno]]'s government by supporting right-wing rebels in Indonesia. The CIA, Taiwan and the Philippines had provided the [[Permesta]] rebels in [[North Sulawesi]] with an insurgent air force, the ''Angkatan Udara Revolusioner'' (AUREV). On 28 April 1958, a CIA pilot, [[William H. Beale]], flying a [[Douglas A-26 Invader|B-26 Invader]] bomber aircraft that was painted black and showing no markings,{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=88}} dropped {{convert|500|lb|kg|sp=us|abbr=off}} of four bombs on Balikpapan. The first damaged the runway at [[Sultan Aji Muhammad Sulaiman Airport]], the second set the British oil tanker {{SS|San Flaviano}} on fire and sank her<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?108400 |title=SS San Flaviano [+1958] |last=Lettens |first=Jan |date=6 January 2011 |work=The Wreck Site |access-date=2011-11-20 |archive-date=22 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220522155033/http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?108400 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=Hansard>{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1958/jun/11/indonesia-british-vessels#S5CV0589P0_19580611_HOC_160 |house=Commons |date=11 June 1958 |column_start=202 |column_end=203 |speaker= [[David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech|David Ormsby-Gore]] |position=Minister of State for Foreign Affairs|title=INDONESIA (BRITISH VESSELS) |access-date=2011-11-21}}</ref><ref name=Time>{{cite news |title=INDONESIA: The Mystery Pilots |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://search.time.com/results.html?N=55&Nty=1&Ns=p_date_range%7C1&Ntt=San+Flaviano&from_month=03&from_day=01&from_year=1958&to_month=06&to_day=01&to_year=1958&x=45&y=14 |date=12 May 1958 |access-date=2011-11-21 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121209043505/http://search.time.com/results.html?N=55&Nty=1&Ns=p_date_range%7C1&Ntt=San+Flaviano&from_month=03&from_day=01&from_year=1958&to_month=06&to_day=01&to_year=1958&x=45&y=14 |archive-date=9 December 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and the third bounced off the British tanker {{MV|Daronia}} without exploding.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=116}} Beale's fourth bomb set on fire and sank the [[Indonesian Navy]] {{sclass|Bathurst|corvette|1}} [[HMAS Ipswich (J186)|KRI ''Hang Tuah'']], killing 18 crew and wounding 28.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=116}} Before attacking ''Hang Tuah'', Beale also machine-gunned the oil pipes to Shell's wharf.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=116}}

The CIA had orders to attack unarmed foreign merchant ships in order to drive foreign trade away from Indonesia and weaken its economy, with the intention of undermining Sukarno's government.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=116}} The day before attacking Balikpapan, Beale had also damaged a Shell complex at [[Ambon, Maluku]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=115}} His Balikpapan raid succeeded in persuading Shell to suspend tanker services from Balikpapan and withdraw shore-based wives and families to [[Singapore]].<ref name=Hansard/> However, on 18 May Indonesian naval and air forces off [[Ambon Island]] shot down an AUREV B-26 and captured its CIA pilot, [[Allen Lawrence Pope|Allen Pope]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|pp=138, 139, 141}}{{sfn|Kahin|Kahin|1997|p=179}} The US immediately withdrew support for Permesta, whose rebellion rapidly diminished thereafter.

===Subsequent history===
Shell continued operating in the area until Indonesian state-owned [[Pertamina]] took it over in 1965.<ref name=Wood/> Lacking technology, skilled manpower, and capital to explore the petroleum region, Pertamina sublet petroleum concession contracts to multinational companies in the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

With the only oil refinery site in the region, Balikpapan emerged as a revitalized center of petroleum production. Pertamina opened its East Borneo headquarters in the city, followed by branch offices established by other international oil companies. Hundreds of laborers from Indonesia, along with skilled expatriates who served as managers and engineers, flocked into the city.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Geography==

===Topography===
[[Topography]] of Balikpapan is generally hilly (85%), with only small areas of flat land (15%), mostly along the coast and surrounding the hilly areas.{{cn|date=September 2024}} The hills are less than {{convert|100|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=off}} higher than the adjacent valleys. The altitude of Balikpapan ranges from 0 to {{convert|80|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=off}} above sea level.{{cn|date=September 2024}} The city proper itself is located on eastern side of [[Balikpapan Bay|Bay of Balikpapan]].

Most of the soil in Balikpapan contains yellow-reddish podsolic soil and [[alluvial]] and [[quartz]] sand, making it extremely prone to erosion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://balikpapan.go.id/read/98/selayang-pandang|title=Pemerintah Kota Balikpapan {{!}} Pemerintah Kota Balikpapan|website=balikpapan.go.id|access-date=2018-10-04|archive-date=4 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004230134/http://balikpapan.go.id/read/98/selayang-pandang|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Climate===
Balikpapan features a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Af'') as there is no real dry season in Balikpapan. The city sees an average of {{convert|2400|mm|in|sp=us|abbr=off}} of rain per year. Balikpapan generally shows little variation in weather throughout the course of the year. The city does not have significantly wetter and drier periods of the year and average temperatures are nearly identical throughout the course of the year, averaging about {{convert|26|to(-)|27|C|F|sp=us|abbr=off}} throughout the year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.balikpapan.climatemps.com/sunlight.php|title=Daylight Hours in Balikpapan, Borneo, Indonesia Daylength|website=balikpapan.climatemps.com|access-date=2019-01-23|archive-date=3 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191203094631/http://www.balikpapan.climatemps.com/sunlight.php|url-status=live}}</ref>
