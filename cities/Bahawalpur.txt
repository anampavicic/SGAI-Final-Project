=== Early history ===

Bahawalpur State was home to various ancient societies. The Bahawalpur region was part of Multan province of [[Mughal Empire]] in recent history.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Dasti |first=Humaira Faiz |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kH3jAAAAMAAJ |title=Multan, a Province of the Mughal Empire, 1525-1751 |date=1998 |publisher=Royal Book |isbn=978-969-407-226-5 |language=en}}</ref> It contains ruins from the [[Indus Valley civilisation]], as well as ancient Buddhist sites such as the nearby [[Patan minara]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_g0NAAAAIAAJ&q=bahawalpur|title=Ancient Bahawalpur|last=Auj|first=Nūruzzamān|date=1987|publisher=Caravan Book Centre|language=en}}</ref> British archaeologist Sir [[Alexander Cunningham]] identified the Bahawalpur region as home of the [[Yaudheya Kingdom|Yaudheya]] kingdoms of the ''[[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LzHpZ5N5MhcC&pg=PA63|title=Geography from Ancient Indian Coins & Seals|last=Gupta|first=Parmanand|date=1989|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=9788170222484|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=North Indian Inscriptions volume III: Inscriptions of the Early Gupta Kings | page=23 | url=http://whatisindia.com/inscriptions/earlyguptakings/politicalhistory23.html }}</ref> Prior to the establishment of Bahawalpur, Cholistan region's major city was [[Uch|Uch Sharif]] – a regional metropolitan centre between the 12th and 17th centuries that is renowned for its collection of historic shrines dedicated to [[Sufi|Muslim mystics]] from the 12–15th centuries built in the region's vernacular style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unescobkk.org/culture/wh/asia-pacific-heritage-awards/previous-heritage-awards-2000-2013/2006/award-winners/2006dt2/|title=UNESCO Office in Bangkok: Uch Monument|website=unescobkk.org|language=en-us|access-date=26 January 2018|archive-date=23 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123131625/http://www.unescobkk.org/culture/wh/asia-pacific-heritage-awards/previous-heritage-awards-2000-2013/2006/award-winners/2006dt2/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==== Establishment ====
Bahawalpur was established in 1748 by Nawab Bahawal Khan I,<ref name="Asian Educational Services">{{cite book|editor1-last=Wright|editor1-first=Arnold|title=Indian States: A Biographical, Historical, and Administrative Survey|date=1922|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=9788120619654|page=145|language=en}}</ref> after he migrated to the region around [[Uch]] from [[Shikarpur, Sindh|Shikarpur]], [[Sindh]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5AglDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA22|title=Blood and Water: The Indus River Basin in Modern History|last=Gilmartin|first=David|date=5 June 2015|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=9780520285293|page=22|language=en}}</ref> Bahawalpur replaced Derawar as the clan's capital city.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lolDAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA204|title=Imperial Gazetteer of India ...|last1=Cotton|first1=James Sutherland|last2=Burn|first2=Sir Richard|last3=Meyer|first3=Sir William Stevenson|date=1908|publisher=Clarendon Press|language=en}}</ref> The city initially flourished as a trading post on trade routes between Afghanistan and central India.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjk9AQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA1|title=The Asiatic Journal and Monthly Register for British India and Its Dependencies|date=1838|publisher=Black, Parbury, & Allen|language=en}}</ref>

==== Durrani Attacks ====
In 1785, the [[Durrani Empire|Durrani]] commander Sirdar Khan attacked Bahawalpur city and destroyed many of its buildings on behalf of Mian Abdul Nabi [[Kalhora dynasty|Kalhora]] of Sindh.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-AteAAAAcAAJ|title=The History of Bahawalpur: With Notices of the Adjacent Countries of Sindh, Afghanistan, Multan, and the West of India|last=Álī|first=Shahāmat|date=1848|publisher=James Madden|language=en}}</ref> Bahawalpur's ruling family, along with nobles from nearby [[Uch]], were forced to take refuge in the [[Derawar Fort]], where they successfully repulsed further attacks.<ref name=":1" /> The attacking Durrani force accepted 60,000 rupees as ''nazrana'' or tribute, though Bahawal Khan later had to seek refuge in the [[Rajput]] states as the Afghan Durranis occupied Derawar Fort.<ref name=":1" /> Bahawal Khan returned to conquer the fort by way of Uch, and re-established control of Bahawalpur.<ref name=":1" />

==== Princely state ====
[[File:Sadeq_Mohammad_Khan.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Sadeq Mohammad Khan V]] served as the last Nawab of Bahawalpur.]]
[[File:Darawar Fort.jpg|thumb|The ruling Abbasi family regarded the nearby [[Derawar Fort]] as a traditional bastion of their power.]]
[[File:Interior of Central Library, Bahawalpur.jpg|thumb|[[Bahawalpur Central Library|Bahawalpur's central library]] dates from the princely state period.]]

The [[princely state]] of Bahawalpur was founded in 1802 by Nawab Mohammad Bahawal Khan II after the break-up of the [[Durrani Empire]], and was based in the city.

==== Sikh Attacks and treaties with the British ====
In 1807, [[Ranjit Singh]] of the [[Sikh Empire]] laid siege to the fort in [[Multan]], prompting refugees to seek safety in Bahawalpur in the wake of his marauding forces that began to attack the countryside around Multan.<ref name=":1" /> Ranjit Singh eventually withdrew the siege, and gave the Nawab of Bahawalpur some gifts as the Sikh forces retreated.<ref name=":1" />
[[File:Chock Fawara.jpg|thumb|Fawara Chowk roundabout]]
Bahalwapur offered an outpost of stability in the wake of crumbling Mughal rule and the declining power of [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan's]] monarchy.<ref name=":1" /> The city became a refuge for prominent families from affected regions and also saw an influx of religious scholars escaping the consolidation of Sikh power in Punjab.<ref name=":1" />

Fearing an invasion from the Sikh Empire,<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rk-sBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA98|title=Historical Dictionary of Pakistan|last=Burki|first=Shahid Javed|date=19 March 2015|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9781442241480|language=en}}</ref> Nawab Mohammad Bahawal Khan III signed a treaty with the [[British India|British]] on 22 February 1833, guaranteeing the independence of the ''Nawab'' and the autonomy of Bahawalpur as a princely state. The treaty guaranteed the British a friendly southern frontier during their invasion of the Sikh Empire.<ref name=":4" />

==== Trade Routes ====
Trade routes had shifted away from Bahawalpur by the 1830s, and British visitors to the city noted several empty shops in the city's bazaar.<ref name=":0" /> The population at this time was estimated to be 20,000,<ref name=":0" /> and was noted to be made up primarily of Hindus.<ref name=":0" /> Also in 1833, the [[Sutlej]] and [[Indus River]]s were opened to navigation, allowing goods to reach Bahawalpur.<ref name=":1" /> By 1845, newly opened trade routes to [[Delhi]] re-established Bahawalpur as a commercial centre.<ref name=":1" /> The city was known in the late 19th century as a centre for the production of [[silk]] goods, ''lungis'', and [[cotton]] goods.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzBAAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA341|title=History of the Panjáb from the Remotest Antiquity to the Present Time|last=bahādur.)|first=Muḥammad Laṭīf (Saiyid, khān|date=1891|publisher=Calcutta Central Press Company, limited|language=en}}</ref> The city's silk was noted to be of higher quality than silk works from [[Benares]] or [[Amritsar]].<ref name=":0" />

==== Increased British Influence ====
An 1866 crisis over succession to the Bahawalpur throne markedly increased British influence in the princely state.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=|title=Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific: An Encyclopedia|last=Minahan|first=James|date=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598846591|language=en}}</ref> Bahawalpur was constituted as a municipality in 1874.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Bahawalpur|title=Bahawalpur {{!}} Pakistan|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=26 January 2018|language=en}}</ref> Bahalwapur's Nawab celebrated the [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria|Golden Jubillee]] of [[Queen Victoria]] in 1887 in a state function at the Noor Mahal palace.<ref name=":2" /> In 1901, the population of the city was 18,546.<ref name=":3" />

===== The Second World War =====
At the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, Bahawalpur's Nawab was the first ruler of a princely state to offer his full support and resources of the state towards the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|crown's]] war efforts.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2QluAAAAMAAJ|title=Politics of Bahawalpur: From State to Region, 1947–2000|last=Javaid|first=Umbreen|date=2004|publisher=Classic|language=en}}</ref>

=== Joining Pakistan ===

British Princely states were given the option to join either Pakistan or [[Dominion of India|India]] upon [[Indian Independence Act 1947|British withdrawal from the Sub-Continent]] in August 1947. The city and the princely state of Bahawalpur acceded to Pakistan on 7 October 1947, under Nawab [[Sadeq Mohammad Khan V|Sadiq Muhammad Khan Abbasi V Bahadur]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Our History {{!}} Bahawalpur|url=https://bahawalpur.punjab.gov.pk/our-history|access-date=2021-11-17|website=bahawalpur.punjab.gov.pk}}</ref> Following independence, the city's minority [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]] communities [[Human migration|migrated]] to India ''en masse'', while [[Muslim]] refugees from India settled in the city and the surrounding region.
