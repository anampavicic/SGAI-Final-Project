'''Changhua County''' ([[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]] [[Hànyǔ Pīnyīn|Pinyin]]: ''Zhānghuà Xiàn''; [[Wade-Giles]]: ''Chang¹-hua⁴ Hsien⁴''<!--DO NOT REMOVE This information helps the reader understand the title of the article.-->; [[Hokkien]] [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī|POJ]]: ''Chiang-hòa-koān'' or ''Chiong-hòa-koān'') is the smallest [[County (Taiwan)|county]] on the main [[island of Taiwan]] by area, and the fourth smallest in the country. With a total population of 1.24 million, Changhua County is the most populous county in the Republic of China. Its capital is [[Changhua|Changhua City]] and it is part of the [[Taichung–Changhua metropolitan area]].

==History==
===Early history===
There are 32 prehistoric burial sites in Changhua that date back 5000 years. The original name of the area was ''Poasoa'' ({{zh|c=[[:zh:半線|半線]]|poj=Pòaⁿ-sòaⁿ|l=half line}}), so-named by the local [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples|indigenous]] tribes. Poasoa used to be inhabited primarily by the [[Babuza people]], who have since been mostly assimilated by the [[Han Taiwanese|Han people]].

===Qing dynasty===
[[Taiwan under Qing rule|Qing rule in Taiwan]] began in 1683, and in 1684, [[Taiwan Prefecture]] was established to administer Taiwan under [[Fujian Province]]. The prefecture consisted of three counties: {{Interlanguage link multi|Taiwan County|zh|3=臺灣縣 (1684年-1887年)}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Fongshan District (Formosa)|zh|3=鳳山縣 (清治時期)}} and [[Zhuluo County|Zhuluo]]. Poasoa and modern-day Changhua County were under the jurisdiction of Zhuluo, but the Changhua area was spread over three counties.

In 1723, after the [[Zhu Yigui]] rebellion, an inspector official in Taiwan requested to the Qing Emperor to designate Changhua to another county magistrate and legal warden because of the increasing population in the northern part of Zhuluo County.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Davidson |first1=James W. |author-link=James W.

Changhua County Hall was built in the middle of the district and is regarded as the beginning of the Changhua County establishment.<ref name="CHCG-Hist">{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.chcg.gov.tw/eng/01us/01history.asp |date=23 Nov 2010 |publisher=Changhua County Government |access-date=25 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110211010/http://www.chcg.gov.tw/eng/01us/01history.asp |archive-date=10 November 2014 }}</ref>

The name of Changhua, meaning "manifestation of a royal civilization", is formally worded "manifestation of the majestic Emperor's civilization spread over the seas".<ref name=CHCG-Hist />

===Japanese rule===
During early [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], the island was subdivided into three {{nihongo||県|ken}}: Taihoku, Taiwan, and Tainan. Changhua was ruled under Taiwan Ken. In 1920, after several administrative changes, [[Taichū Prefecture]] was established, covering modern-day Changhua County, [[Nantou County]] and [[Taichung City]]. By 1930, the population in Changhua already exceeded one million.

===After World War II===
After the [[History of Taiwan since 1945|after World War II of Taiwan]] on 25 December 1945, the area of the current Changhua County was established under the jurisdiction of [[Taichung County]]. On 16 August 1950 after its separation from Taichung County, '''Changhua County''' was established with [[Changhua City]] as its [[county seat]] on 1 December 1951.<ref>{{cite news|date=1 February 2011|url=https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&post=6187|title=Rezoning Taiwan|publisher=Taiwan Today|access-date=9 December 2020}}</ref>

==Geography==
Changhua county is located on the west coast of Taiwan, bordering [[Taichung City]] on the north separated by [[Dadu River (Taiwan)|Dadu River]], so Changhua County and Taichung City are often referred to as the [[Taichung–Changhua metropolitan area]]. Changhua County is bordered by [[Yunlin County]] to the south by the [[Zhuoshui River]]. To the east, Changhua County is separated from [[Nantou County]] and southern Taichung City by [[Bagua Plateau]]. To the west, Changhua County faces the [[Taiwan Strait]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chcg.gov.tw/eng/01us/02location.asp|title=Geographic Location-CHANGHUA COUNTYGOVERNMENT|work=chcg.gov.tw|access-date=2014-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826113852/http://www.chcg.gov.tw/eng/01us/02location.asp|archive-date=2014-08-26}}</ref>

The county's total area is {{convert|1074|km2|abbr=on}}, being Taiwan's smallest county. It owns a {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} of coastline. The landscape of Changhua can be roughly divided into two parts, one being the western flat land, and the other being the [[Changhua Plain]]. This two combines measures up to 88% of Changhua county's total area. The highest elevation in Changhua is "Hen Shan", at {{convert|443|m|abbr=on}}.
