'''Wenling''' ([[Taizhou Wu|Wenling dialect]]: Ueng-ling Zy {{IPA-wuu|ʔuəŋ ʔliŋ zɿ|}}; {{zh|s=温岭市|t=溫嶺市|p=Wēnlǐng Shì}}) is a coastal [[county-level city]] in the municipal region of [[Taizhou, Zhejiang|Taizhou]], in southeastern [[Zhejiang]] [[province of China|province]], China. It borders [[Luqiao District|Luqiao]] and [[Huangyan District|Huangyan]] to the north, [[Yuhuan County|Yuhuan]] to the south, [[Yueqing]] to the west, looks out to the [[East China Sea]] to the east. Wenling locates on 28°22'N, 121°21'E, approximately {{convert|300|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Shanghai]].

[[Jiangxia Tidal Power Station]] is located there as well as a number of [[e-waste recycling]] centers which have contributed to [[soil contamination]] in the region.<ref>http://www.mendeley.com/research/heavy-metal-persistent-organic-compound-contamination-soil-wenling-emerging-ewaste-recycling-city-taizhou-area-china/ {{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref>

Because of its geographical location, Wenling has long suffered from typhoons. On August 12, 2004, [[Typhoon Rananim]], the sixth strongest typhoon in PRC history, landed in Shitang Town, Wenling. On 10 August 2019, [[Typhoon Lekima]], the third strongest in PRC history, came ashore at Chengnan Town, Wenling.

==History==
During the [[Xia dynasty|Xia]], [[Shang dynasty|Shang]], and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] [[Dynasties of China|dynasties]], Wenling was not part of the [[ancient China|Chinese state]] but rather part of the separate culture of [[Dong'ou Kingdom|Dong'ou]]. Following the third-century&nbsp;BC conquests of the [[Qin Empire]], it was incorporated into the [[Minzhong Prefecture]] before being moved to [[Kuaiji Prefecture|Kuaiji]] under the [[Han dynasty|Han]]. From the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] to the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], Wenling was divided between [[Taizhou, Zhejiang|Taizhou]]'s [[Huangyan District]] and [[Wenzhou]]'s [[Yueqing]] District.

In 1469, [[Taiping County]] was formed in the area from Fangyan, Taiping, and Fanchang, three villages formerly incorporated into [[Huangyan District|Huangyan]]. [[Yueqing|Yueqing County]]'s Shanmen and Yuhuan villages were ceded in 1476.
In 1513, the county seat built {{convert|2.5|km|sp=us}} of city wall, roughly squared, giving it the name of "Square Castle".
In 1914, the county was renamed Wenling to distinguish it from counties with same name in [[Shanxi Province|Shanxi]], [[Sichuan Province|Sichuan]], and [[Anhui]]. Wenling ("warm mountain") was once another name of [[Wenqiao Town]].

Wenling was conquered by [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist]] forces on May 28, 1949, and the county government was created. In March 1994, Wenling was made a county-level "city".
