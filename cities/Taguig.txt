'''Taguig''' ({{IPA|tl|audio=LL-Q33298 (fil)-Sy.Paul-Taguig.wav|taˈɡiɡ|lang}}), officially the '''City of Taguig''' ({{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Taguig}}), is a coastal city located in eastern shores of [[Metro Manila]]. It is the [[List of cities in the Philippines|fifth-most populous city]] in the Philippines with a population of 1.2 million people.{{PH census|current}} The city is one of the Philippines' cultural, financial, high-tech, entertainment and media centers with significant influence on commerce, health care, research, technology, education, politics, [[Tourism in Metro Manila|tourism]], dining, art, fashion, and sports. Taguig is also an important center for the country's [[Diplomacy|international diplomacy]], hosting several embassies. The city also home to the headquarters of several major multinational corporations. Taguig has the [[List of tallest structures in the Philippines#Cities with the most high-rises and skyscrapers|fourth largest skyline]] in the Philippines, with 289 high-rises, 80 of which exceed {{cvt|100|m|0}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Philippines |url=https://www.emporis.com/country/100131/philippines |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407003531/http://www.emporis.com/country/100131/philippines |url-status=usurped |archive-date=April 7, 2015 |website=Emporis |access-date=13 July 2022}}</ref>

The city is located alongside the northwestern shores of [[Laguna de Bay]] in [[Metro Manila]], Philippines. The city is widely known for [[Bonifacio Global City]], one of the leading financial centers of the Philippines. Originally a fishing village during the Spanish and American colonial periods, it experienced rapid growth when former military reservations were converted by the [[Bases Conversion and Development Authority]] (BCDA) into financial centers and mixed-use planned communities. Taguig became a [[Cities of the Philippines#Independent cities|highly urbanized city]] with the passage of Republic Act No. 8487 in 2004, which was ratified by a plebiscite.

The city covers about {{convert|47.28|sqkm|sp=us}}.<ref name="Taguig Demographics" /> It is located in the southeastern portion of [[Metro Manila]] and bordered by [[Pasig]] and [[Pateros]] to the north, [[Makati]] and [[Mandaluyong]] to the northwest, [[Pasay]] and [[Parañaque]] to the west, [[Taytay, Rizal]] to the northeast and [[Muntinlupa]] to the south.

==Etymology==
The original farmer-fishermen of the area, about 800 in number, were good at threshing rice after harvest. Hence, they were referred to as "''mga taga-giik''" ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for "rice thresher") and the settlement as "''pook ng mga taga-giik''" ({{translation|place of the rice threshers|literal=yes}}). Spanish friar Fray Alonso de Alvarado, together with conquistador [[Ruy López de Villalobos]] who crossed the [[Pasig River]] to reach the city's present site in 1571, found "taga-giik" difficult to pronounce. "Tagui-ig" was later shortened to its current form "Taguig".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.taguig.gov.ph/our-city/history/|title=History|website=Official Website of The City of Taguig|language=en-US|access-date=April 18, 2016}}</ref> It is also spelled as "Tagig" or "Tagui".

== History ==

=== Early history ===
[[File:Tondo and Pasig 1450.png|thumb|left|Map of the Union of [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]] and Pasig, circa 1450, with Tagig on the southeast]]
Before the [[Spaniards]] came, Taguig was a stablished [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] settlement with [[Moro people|Moro]] and [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] present in the area as revealed by the recent archaeological diggings of various artifacts like cups, plates and other utensils, which bear Chinese characters. This was believed to have originated from China's [[Ming dynasty]].<ref>Ang Tagig at ang Kanyang Kasaysayan. by Jose Pagtakhan circa 1963.</ref> [[Duck]] culture was practiced by the Tagalogs, particularly in the areas where the city and the [[Pateros|Municipality of Pateros]] stands today.

===Spanish rule (1571-1898)===
[[File:Simborio, Taguig Cemetery (2020).jpg|thumb|left|Simborio at Taguig Cemetery]]
Taguig was one of the earliest known territories of the [[Tondo (historical polity)|Provincia de Tondo]], that became the [[Manila (province)|Provincia de Maynila]] to have been Christianized when the Spaniards succeeded in subjugating mainland Luzon through the [[Miguel López de Legazpi|Legazpi]] expedition in 1571. Between the years 1573 and 1587, Taguig was an encomienda under Captain Cervantes y Vergara with 3,200 inhabitants paying 1,879 and 1/2 tax.<ref name="Tomas L">{{Citation |author=Tomas L. |title=Magat Salamat |url=http://geocities.com/sinupan/magatsalamat.htm |access-date=July 14, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027123420/http://geocities.com/sinupan/magatsalamat.htm |archive-date=October 27, 2009 |url-status=unfit}}</ref><ref>Relacion de las Yslas Filipinas.

Quadricentennial (1587-1987) St. Anne Parish Tagig, Metro Manila; commemorative book page 36, circa 1987.</ref> Taguig was established as a separate "[[pueblo]]" (town) on April 4, 1587, "Tomamos de nuevo la casa de Tagui", when the Augustinian Order reaccepted the vote of the convent of Taguig during a meeting of the Augustinian Chapter in Intramuros according to Friar Gaspar de San Agustin.<ref>Augustinian Archives, Valladolid, Spain, Libro de Gobierno de la Provincia.

Juan Basi,<ref>Labor Evangelica Ministerios Apostolic De los Obreros De la Campania De Iesus. page 454</ref> a nephew of [[Lakan Dula]] and son-in-law of the [[Sultan of Brunei]], was the [[Lakan]] of Taguig from 1587 to 1588 who participated in the [[Tondo Conspiracy]] of 1587, an attempt to overthrow the Spanish government which failed. Basi was exiled for two years as punishment. According to records, Taguig had nine barrios then, namely: [[Bagumbayan, Taguig|Bagumbayan]], [[Bambang, Taguig|Bambang]], [[Hagonoy, Taguig|Hagonoy]] (Hagunoy), Palingon (Palingong), [[Santa Ana, Taguig|Santa Ana]], Tipas, Tuktukan (Toctocan), [[Ususan]], and Wawa (Uaua). Santa Ana was then the municipal center (''[[poblacion]]'') of Taguig.<ref name="urbanroamer">{{cite web|url=https://www.theurbanroamer.com/santa-ana-taguig-probinsyudad/|title=Taguig's Santa Ana and the "probinsyudad" feels|date=February 5, 2021|accessdate=June 16, 2023|website=The Urban Roamer}}</ref><ref name="Quadricentennial 1987 page 36"/>

There was an attempt to transfers Tipas from Taguig to Pasig because the residents of that barrio dislike the [[Curate|Cura]] or Parish Priest stationed at Taguig during that time. They raised it to the [[Gobernadorcillo]] (Leader and Judge) at that time, he said for the issue to be resolve the bells from Taguig and Pasig will be ring simultaneously. Which of these bells should be heard in Tipas will be town where it belongs to. The Bells of Taguig prevailed, that's why Tipas remained to be within the Jurisdiction of Taguig.<ref>Ang Taguig at Ang Kanyang Kasaysayan, page 4, Jose Pagtakhan circa 1965.</ref> Records also shows that Tipas had several attempts petitioning to become an independent town but was denied during the Spanish and American governments.<ref>A gift of faith, 400 years. Quadricentennial (1587-1987) St. Anne Parish Tagig, Metro Manila; commemorative book page 56, circa 1987.</ref>

During that time, Taguig was accessible via the [[Pasig River]], which was connected to two large bodies of water, [[Manila Bay]] and [[Laguna de Bay]]. The town produced more than enough rice for consumption but had less sugar cane to mill. The men lived through fishing while women wove cotton cloth and "sawali" from bamboo strips. The people of Taguig were known to have resisted both Spanish and American colonial rule. When the [[Katipunan]] was on its early years, many from Taguig became followers and later joined the uprising. The people of Taguig also joined the revolutionary government of General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] on August 6, 1898.

Santiago Bonifacio, the father of revolutionary [[Andres Bonifacio]], hailed from Ligid Tipas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Santiago-Bonifacio/6000000014661156461|title=Santiago Rosales Bonifacio|website=Geni.com|date=April 28, 2022 |accessdate=January 8, 2024}}</ref> Barrio Tipas, specifically the [[Napindan Lighthouse]] in Barrio [[Napindan]] became a meeting place and staging point of some revolutionary attacks against Spanish forces by the [[Katipunan]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.ijert.org/research/napindan-lighthouse-a-historic-insight-towards-recognition-and-preservation-IJERTV5IS050268.pdf|title=Napindan Lighthouse: A Historic Insight Towards Recognition and Preservation|date=May 2016|journal=International Journal of Engineering Research & Technology|volume=5|issue=5|first1=Vannessa|last1=Umali|first2=Orlando|last2=Ramos|first3=Andres|last3=Delos Santos}}</ref>

====Attempted transfer of town center====
In the 1880 up to 1919, flood water submerged almost all the lower portion of Taguig from Napindan to Bagumbayan during the months of August up to October. The Hacenderos of Maysapan and Taguig proposed to transfer the Town center and church to a higher place now part of [[Fort Bonifacio]]. The parish priest also supported the move and ordered to ready a parcel of land to be ready to build a new church to house the convent. However, since the local population of Taguig, during that time, are farmers and fishermen, the decision to move the town center and church was not that popular to them. They didn't want to move out away from their farmland and to the river leading them to the bay. The remnant of the church is still visible until the 1970s. The place was called "Bahay Pari" (Priest House).<ref>Ang Taguig at Ang Kanyang Kasaysayan, page 5 and 6, Jose Pagtakhan circa 1965.</ref>

===American rule (1898-1946)===
During the [[United States|American]] occupation, Taguig natives fought against the forces of General Wheaton under the command of General Pio del Pilar. It was recorded that on February 6, 1899, Filipino forces including Taguig "revolutionarios" dislodged an American position in the hills of Taguig, now a portion of [[Pateros]] and [[Fort Bonifacio]]. They were defeated eventually by the Americans with superiority in the armaments and training. Taguig finally fell to the contingent of the First Washington Volunteer Infantry led by Col. Wholly.

The defeat of the Filipinos after two years of struggle against the American forces subsequently subjected the Philippines to another system of governance. On August 14, 1898, United States occupied the islands and established a military government with General [[Wesley Merritt]] as the First Military Governor. He exercised legislative powers until September 1, 1900. At the start of American occupation, Taguig was proclaimed as an independent municipality with the promulgation of General Order No. 4 on March 29, 1900. The town was subsequently incorporated to the newly created province of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]] when the Philippine Commission promulgated Act No. 137 on June 11, 1901.<ref>{{Cite PH act|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l2485 |date=June 11, 1901 |title=An Act Extending the Provisions of the Provincial Government Act to the Province of Rizal |chamber=Act |number=137|access-date=June 16, 2023}}</ref>

On October 12, 1903, Taguig, [[Muntinlupa]] and [[Pateros]] were merged by the virtue of Act. No. 942 to be known as the Municipality of Pateros, with Pateros hosting the seat of the municipal government.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=942|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l89ad|date=October 12, 1903|accessdate=June 16, 2023|title=An Act Reducing the Thirty-Two Municipalities of the Province of Rizal to Fifteen}}</ref> The merger did not last long as a month later Muntinlupa was separated from it and made part of [[Biñan]], [[Laguna (province)|La Laguna]] when Act.

Muntinlupa was later reintegrated to the Municipality of Pateros on March 22, 1905, with the promulgation Act No. 1308. The Act also renamed the Municipality of Pateros into the Municipality of Taguig, and the seat of government was transferred from Pateros to Taguig.<ref>{{cite PH act|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l43ec|chamber=Act|number=1308|date=March 22, 1905|accessdate=June 16, 2023|title=An Act providing for the return of the former municipality of Muntinlupa from the Province of La Laguna to the Province of Rizal, repealing paragraph (e) of section one and sections two and three of Act Numbered One thousand and eight, and changing the name of the municipality of Pateros, of the Province of Rizal, to Taguig}}</ref> Eventually, Pateros separated from Taguig by January 1, 1909 and Muntinlupa was granted an independent municipality status on December 17, 1917.<ref name="history_munti">{{cite news|url=https://muntinlupacity.gov.ph/history/|title=History|website=City Government of Muntinlupa|accessdate=June 16, 2023}}</ref>

It was also during the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American Colonial Period]] that the United States government acquired a {{cvt|25.78|km2}} property of Taguig for military purposes. This large piece of land, which had a TCT dated 1902, was turned into a camp that became known as Fort William McKinley, named after the [[William McKinley|25th president of the U.S.]] who was responsible for the American colonization of the Philippines.

When the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupied the Philippines]] in 1942, Fort McKinley was taken over by the [[Japanese Imperial Army]]. Fort McKinley was renamed as ''Sakura Heiei'' (Cherry Blossom Barracks) and became one of their most important installation and expanded its [[Fort Bonifacio Tunnel|network of tunnels]] which served as shelter of the high military officials. They occupied the military camp until the end of [[World War II]] in 1945.

===20th century (1945-1986)===
[[File:Philippine Island - Luzon Island - NARA - 68156821 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Fort Bonifacio|Fort William McKinley]], now Fort Bonifacio, was surrendered by the United States to the Philippines in 1946]]
After the Philippines gained its political independence from the United States on July 4, 1946, the US relinquished to the Republic of the Philippines all right of possession, jurisdiction, supervision and control over the Philippine territory except the use of the military bases. On May 14, 1949, [[Fort William McKinley]] was turned over to the Philippine government by virtue of the US Embassy Note No. 0570. Fort McKinley was made the permanent headquarters of the Philippine Army in 1957 and was subsequently renamed [[Fort Bonifacio]] after the Father of the Philippine Revolution against Spain, [[Andres Bonifacio]].

====Martial law era (1972-1986)====
When President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] placed the Philippines under [[Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos|martial law]] in 1972, Taguig, which contained [[Fort Bonifacio]], became the host of two detention centers full of political prisoners - the Maximum Security Unit (where Senators [[Jose W.

A recent petition to the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] sought a recount of the plebiscite and on February 19, 2004, the Supreme Court ordered the Commission on Elections to conduct a recount. The recount showed that the majority of residents did want the municipality of Taguig to become a city, with 21,105 "yes" and 19,460 "no".

In 2011, during 424th foundation day, Mayor Lani Cayetano took pride in calling the city a "Probinsyudad" (a [[portmanteau]] of [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] words of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] origin ''probinsya'' and ''syudad'') because it is the only remaining city in Metro Manila which has the amenities of a highly urbanized city and of a province, what with its more than {{convert|10|km|sp=us}} of lakeshore, with farmers, fishermen, old churches, a historic lighthouse, and with people whose virtue of ''pagtutulungan'' ({{translation|cooperation}}) is still very much alive.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/other-sections/starweek-magazine/2011/04/24/678469/ncrs-probinsyudad-holds-424th-anniversary|title=NCR's 'ProbinSyudad' holds 424th Anniversary|website=Philstar.com|date=April 24, 2011|accessdate=June 16, 2023}}</ref> The word "Probinsyudad" was registered as the city's trademark with the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL) in March 2024.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://mb.com.ph/2024/3/11/taguig-lgu-officially-trademarks-probinsyudad-with-ipophl |title=NCR's 'ProbinSyudad' holds 424th Anniversary |publisher=ManilaBulletin |last1=Hicap |first1=Jonathan |website=mb.com.ph |date=March 12, 2024 |accessdate=April 6, 2024 }}</ref>

By the turn of the 21st century, former military reservations in the Fort Bonifacio area were developed by the [[Bases Conversion and Development Authority]] (BCDA) into central business districts and mixed-use townships. These give rise to one of the Philippines' leading financial centers, the [[Bonifacio Global City]] (BGC). The BCDA also developed other townships in Fort Bonifacio area such as the [[Bonifacio Capital District]] and the McKinley Hill. Other mixed-developments within the city include the Acacia Estate and Scala Estate by Vista Land in the central part of the city, and [[Arca South]] by [[Ayala Land]] in Western Bicutan. In February 2018, the [[Philippine Stock Exchange]] moved its corporate office from Makati to BGC.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://corporate.pse.com.ph/about-pse/corporate-profile/history/ |title=Corporate Profile - History |publisher=Philippine Stock Exchange |website=corporate.pse.com.ph |accessdate=April 6, 2024 }}</ref>

==Geography==
Taguig is located on the northwestern shores of [[Laguna de Bay]], the largest lake in the Philippines. The [[Pasig River]] and its tributary, the Taguig River, run through the northern half of the city, while the Napindan River, another tributary of Pasig, forms the natural border between Taguig in Pasig. A relatively small area of the city called Ibayo Napindan is located north of the river, adjoining the disputed territories between Pasig, Taguig, and [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]] in [[Rizal (province)|Rizal Province]]. The city bordered by [[Pasig]] and [[Pateros]] to the north, [[Makati]] and [[Mandaluyong]] to the northwest, [[Pasay]] and [[Parañaque]] to the west, Taytay to the northeast, and [[Muntinlupa]] to the south.

The West Valley fault of the [[Marikina Valley Fault System]] traverses barangays Comembo, East Rembo, Pembo, Post Proper Southside, Rizal, Pinagsama, South Signal Village, North Signal Village, South Daang Hari, Central Bicutan, Ususan, Upper Bicutan, Central Signal Village, Maharlika Village, Lower Bicutan, Bagumbayan and Bagong Tanyag.

According to the cadastral map of Taguig, the boundary and jurisdiction limit of Taguig is the Rio del Pueblo now called Tapayan River, a tributary of the [[Pasig River]] from Barangay Pinagbuhatan, Pasig to Barangay Santa Ana, Taytay, Rizal.<ref>https://bonifacioridge.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/cv-98377-municipality-of-taguig-vs-municipality-of-makati.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=August 2024}}</ref> The city has a total area of {{convert|47.28|sqkm|sp=us}},<ref name="Taguig Demographics" /> including the [[Embo, Taguig|Embo]] barangays previously under Makati.

===Cityscape===
The city is divided into many districts. These districts and neighborhoods were developed piecemeal, especially the 10 Embo barangays which were mostly developed by [[Makati]] prior to their transfer to the jurisdiction of Taguig.

Taguig had nine ''Nayon'' or [[barrio]]s until September 21, 1974, when the Presidential Decree No. 557 was enacted.<ref name="pd557" /> The number of [[barangay]]s was increased to 18 by virtue of a 1971 municipal council resolution during the term of Mayor Monico Tanyag by subdividing the Nayon of Tipas into four barrios, namely: Calzada Tipas, Palingon Tipas, Ligid Tipas, and Ibayo Tipas. The Nayon of Bicutan, which is part of the former U.S. military base [[Fort Bonifacio|Fort William McKinley]], was divided into Lower Bicutan, Upper Bicutan, Western Bicutan, and the Enlisted Men's Barrios like Signal Village. After the conversion of Taguig from a Municipality to a City in 2004, the Taguig City Council in 2008 added 10 more barangays that was later approved in a plebiscite.<ref name="mo292">{{cite PH act|chamber=MO|number=292, s. 2008|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2008/12/12/memorandum-order-no-292-s-2008/|title=Expressing Concurrence and Ratification in the Deputation of Law Enforcement Agencies and Other Concerned Agencies in Connection With the December 18, 2008 Plebiscite to Ratify the Creation of Barangay San Miguel, Barangay Tanyag, Barangay South Daang Hari, Barangay North Daang Hari, Barangay Central Bicutan, Barangay North Signal Village, Barangay Katuparan, Barangay South Signal Village, Barangay Central Signal Village, Barangay Pinagsama, Barangay Fort Bonifacio and New Lower Bicutan, All of Taguig City|date=December 12, 2008|publisher=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines]]}}</ref> Bagong Tanyag was separated from Bagumbayan, in honor of the longest-serving mayor of Taguig.

===Territorial disputes===
{{further|Makati–Taguig boundary dispute}}
[[File:Bonifacio Global City contested between Taguig and Makati.svg|thumb|right|Contested territories between Makati, Pateros and Taguig.]]

Taguig was involved in a territorial dispute with [[Makati]] and [[Pateros]]. In 1993, Taguig filed a complaint against Makati over the entirety of [[Fort Bonifacio]] and the [[Embo, Taguig|Enlisted Men's Barangays (EMBOs)]], claiming these areas were within its territory. The complaint also alleged that Presidential Proclamation Nos. 2475, s. 1986, and 518, s. 1990, were unconstitutional for altering Taguig's boundaries without a plebiscite. In 2011, the Pasig Regional Trial Court upheld Taguig's claim over the Fort Bonifacio Military Reservation, including the EMBO barangays, and ordered Makati to stop exercising jurisdiction over these areas. The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] affirmed this ruling with finality on April 27, 2022, declaring that [[Bonifacio Global City]] and the surrounding EMBO barangays were under Taguig's jurisdiction.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Panaligan |first=Rey |date=April 27, 2022 |title=SC affirms RTC ruling for Taguig City in territorial dispute with Makati City |work=[[Manila Bulletin]] |url=https://mb.com.ph/2022/04/27/sc-affirms-rtc-ruling-for-taguig-city-in-territorial-dispute-with-makati-city/ |access-date=April 27, 2022}}</ref>

Moreover, in around 2001, Taguig and [[Parañaque]] resolved a territorial dispute, agreeing that the Bicutan Market and the Bicutan Interchange, which involves the [[South Luzon Expressway]], would be part of Parañaque.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Aravilla|first=Jose |date=November 12, 2001 |title=Parañaque, Taguig to meet on Bicutan market jurisdiction |url=https://www.philstar.com/metro/2001/11/12/139813/parantildeaque-taguig-meet-bicutan-market-jurisdiction |access-date=June 8, 2024|publisher=[[The Philippine Star]]}}</ref>

Under the [[Köppen climate classification]] system, Manila has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Am''), closely bordering on a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Aw''). The climate of Taguig is characterized by two types of season: dry season from November to April, and wet season from May to October. Rainfall is less evenly distributed. Together with the rest of the Philippines, Taguig lies entirely within the tropics.

[[Tropical cyclone]]s are relatively common, which resulted in flashfloods in low-lying areas of the city, especially those near major rivers and the [[Laguna de Bay]]. In 2009, [[Typhoon Ketsana]] hit Metro Manila, and the City of Taguig is one of the worst hit areas in the capital region when flood water inundate almost the whole city.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://reliefweb.int/report/philippines/situation-report-philippines-typhoon-ondoy |title=Situation report Philippines - Typhoon Ondoy |publisher=[[ReliefWeb]] |date=September 29, 2009 |access-date=April 24, 2024 }}</ref>
