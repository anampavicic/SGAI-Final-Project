The greater area of Heraklion has been continuously inhabited since at least 7000 BCE, making it one of the oldest inhabited regions in Europe. It is also home to the ancient [[Knossos]] Palace, a major center of the [[Minoan civilization]] dating back to approximately 2000-1350 BCE, often considered Europe's oldest city. The palace is one of the most significant archaeological sites in Greece, second only to the [[Parthenon]] in terms of visitor numbers.

==Etymology==

The name Herakleion (Ηράκλειον) was revived in the 19th century and was in use by locals as early as 1867.<ref>{{cite book |first=Samuel Gridley |last=Howe |title=The Cretan refugees and their American helpers |date=1868 |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_TXcKAAAAIAAJ/page/n33 |publisher=Lee and Shepard |location=Boston |page=33 |via=archive.org}}</ref> It originates from the ancient city and port of Herakleion (Ἡράκλειον),<ref name=Barrington>{{Cite Barrington|60}}</ref><ref>{{Cite DARE|25167}}</ref> named after the hero [[Heracles]] (Hercules).<ref>{{Cite Stephanus|''s.v.''}}</ref> In antiquity, Herakleion served as the port of [[Knossos]], located about 20 stadia (roughly 3.7 kilometers) away.<ref name=Stadiasmus>''[[Stadiasmus Maris Magni]]'' §§ 348-349.</ref> [[Strabo]] also confirms this relationship between Herakleion and Knossos.<ref>{{Cite Strabo|x. pp. 476, 484}}</ref>

The location of the ancient city falls within the modern city of Heraklion, near the current port area. Although ecclesiastical records do not list Herakleion as a bishopric, a bishop named Theodoros of Heracleopolis is mentioned at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]].<ref>Cornel. ''Creta Sacr.'' vol. i. p. 254.</ref>

==Other Names==

1. ''In antiquity'': The area that would later become the city of Heraklion served as the port for the ancient city of [[Knossos]], one of the centers of the Minoan civilization. This strategic location facilitated trade and communication across the Mediterranean. Over time, as Knossos declined, the port area grew in significance, eventually becoming a prominent urban center.

2. ''Rabḍ al-ḫandaq'' (ربض الخندق): In 824 CE, Arab exiles from [[al-Andalus]] (Iberia) who conquered Crete and founded the [[Emirate of Crete]] moved the island's capital from [[Gortyna]] to a new castle they called ''rabḍ al-ḫandaq'' ("Castle of the Moat").<ref>''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', ''s.v.'' Iķrīṭish</ref>

3. ''Chándax'' (Χάνδαξ) / ''Chándakas'' (Χάνδακας): The Arabic name ''rabḍ al-ḫandaq'' was Hellenized to Χάνδαξ (''Chándax'') or Χάνδακας (''Chándakas'').

4. ''Candia'': This name, derived from ''Chándax,'' was Latinized as ''Candia'' and taken into other European languages: in [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Latin language|Latin]] as ''Candia'', in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as '' Candía'', in French as ''Candie'', and in English as ''Candy''. These names could refer to the island of Crete as a whole as well as to the city alone; the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] name for the city was ''Kandiye''.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

5. ''Megalo Kastro'' (Μεγάλο Κάστρο): After the [[Byzantine reconquest of Crete]], the city was locally known as ''Megalo Kastro'' ({{lang|el|Μεγάλο Κάστρο}},{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} 'Big Castle' in [[Greek language|Greek]]) and its inhabitants were called ''Kastrinoi'' (Καστρινοί, "castle-dwellers").

===Minoan era===

Heraklion is home to the ruins of the palace of [[Knossos]], located in the southern periphery of the city and part of the Heraklion municipality. In [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] times, Knossos was the largest centre of population on [[Crete]] and is considered by many to be the oldest city in Europe.<ref>Whitelaw, Todd (2000). "Beyond the palace: A century of investigation at Europe's oldest city". Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies: 223, 226.</ref>

Knossos itself had a port at the site of Heraklion (in the modern area of Poros-Katsambas<ref>{{Cite book |chapter=The Earlier Prepalatial Settlement of Poros-Katsambas: craft production and exchange at the harbour town of Knossos |first1=N. |last1=Dimopoulou |first2=D.E. |last2=Wilson |first3=P.M. |last3=Day |editor-first1=P.M. |editor-last1=Day |editor-first2=R. |editor-last2=Doonan |title=Metallurgy in the Early Bronze Age Aegean |series=Sheffield Studies in Aegean Archaeology |date=2007 |pages=84–97 |url=https://www.academia.edu/30665853 |publisher=Oxbow Books |access-date=2019-01-31 |archive-date=2023-04-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230420182756/https://www.academia.edu/30665853 |url-status=live }}</ref> neighborhood) from the beginning of the [[Early Minoan]] period (3500 to 2100 BC).

===Antiquity===
{{main|Heracleium}}
After the fall of the Minoans, Heraklion, as well as the rest of Crete in general, fared poorly, with very little development in the area. Only with the arrival of the Romans did some construction in the area begin, yet especially early into [[Byzantine]] times the area abounded with pirates and bandits.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Heraklion in Crete island - Greeka.com |url=https://www.greeka.com/crete/heraklion/heraklion-history.htm |website=Greeka |access-date=11 February 2019 |archive-date=12 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190212011544/https://www.greeka.com/crete/heraklion/heraklion-history.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Emirate of Crete===

Heraklion was chosen as capital in 824, with fortifications starting being built the following year, by the [[Arabs]] under [[Abu Hafs Umar al-Iqritishi|Abu Hafs Umar]] who had been expelled from [[Al-Andalus]] by Emir [[Al-Hakam I]] and had taken over the island from the Eastern Roman Empire.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} They built a [[moat]] around the city for protection, and named the city ''rabḍ al-ḫandaq'' (ربض الخندق, "Castle of the Moat", hellenized as Χάνδαξ, ''Chandax''). It became the capital of the [[Emirate of Crete]] ({{Circa|827}}–961). The Saracens allowed the port to be used as a safe haven for pirates who operated against Imperial (Byzantine) shipping and raided Imperial territory around the Aegean.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

===Byzantine era===
{{Further|Byzantine Crete}}

In 960, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] forces under the command of [[Nikephoros II|Nikephoros Phokas]], later to become Emperor, landed in Crete and attacked the city. After a [[Siege of Chandax|prolonged siege]], the city fell in March 961. The Saracen inhabitants were slaughtered, the city looted and burned to the ground.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} Soon rebuilt, the town remained under [[Byzantine]] control for the next 243 years.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

===Venetian era===
[[File:Città di Candia - Francesco Basilicata - 1618.jpg|thumb|Representation of the city of Candia and the surrounding area by [[Francesco Basilicata]], 1618|251x251px]]
{{Further|Kingdom of Candia}} {{Further|Siege of Candia}}
In 1204, the city was bought by the [[Republic of Venice]] as part of a complicated political deal which involved, among other things, the Crusaders of the [[Fourth Crusade]] restoring the deposed Eastern Roman Emperor [[Isaac II Angelus]] to his throne. The Venetians improved on the ditch of the city by building enormous fortifications, most of which are still in place, including a giant wall, in places up to {{convert|40|m}} thick, with seven bastions, and a fortress in the harbour. Chandax was renamed ''Candia'' and became the seat of the [[Duke of Candia]], and the Venetian administrative district of Crete became known as "Regno di Candia" ([[Kingdom of Candia]]). The city retained the name of Candia for centuries and the same name was often used to refer to the whole [[List of islands of Greece|island]] of Crete as well. To secure their rule, the Venetians began in 1212 to settle families from [[Venice]] on Crete. The coexistence of two different cultures and the stimulus of the [[Italian Renaissance]] led to a flourishing of letters and the arts in Candia and Crete in general, that is today known as the ''[[Cretan Renaissance]]''.

===Ottoman era===

{{Further|Cretan War (1645–1669)}}

During the [[Cretan War (1645–1669)]], the Ottomans [[Siege of Candia|besieged the city]] for 21 years, from 1648 to 1669, the longest siege in history up until that time. In its final phase, which lasted for 22 months, 70,000 Turks, 38,000 Cretans and slaves and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders perished.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.msc.gr/veniva/uk/main/p2.htm |title=The War for Candia |access-date=2006-08-05 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035205/http://www.msc.gr/veniva/uk/main/p2.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> The Ottoman army under an [[Albanians|Albanian]] [[grand vizier]], [[Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed Pasha]] conquered the city in 1669.

Under the Ottomans, ''Kandiye'' ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] قنديه) was the capital of Crete (''Girit Eyâleti'') until 1849, when [[Chania]] (''Hanya'') became the capital, and Kandiye became a [[Sanjak|sancak]].<ref name="sezen">Tahir Sezen, ''Osmanlı Yer Adları'', Ankara 2017, T.C.

During the Ottoman period, the [[harbour]] silted up, so most shipping shifted to [[Chania]] in the west of the island.

===Modern era===
[[File:Κούλες 14.jpg|thumb|270px| Panoramic view of the port of Heraklion from [[Koules Fortress]]]]
An [[1856 Heraklion earthquake|earthquake]] located off the northern coast of Crete on October 12, 1856, destroyed most of the over 3,600 homes in the city. Only 18 homes were left intact. The disaster claimed 538 victims in Heraklion.<ref name=NGDC>{{citation|title=Significant Earthquake Database|url=https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazel/view/hazards/earthquake/event-more-info/2005|author=National Geophysical Data Center / World Data Service (NGDC/WDS)|publisher=[[National Geophysical Data Center]], [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]|doi=10.7289/V5TD9V7K|year=1972|type=Data Set|access-date=2022-06-05|archive-date=2023-02-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230227002538/https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazel/view/hazards/earthquake/event-more-info/2005|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1898, the autonomous [[Cretan State]] was created, under Ottoman [[suzerainty]], with Prince George of Greece as its High Commissioner and under international supervision. During the period of direct occupation of the island by the Great Powers (1898–1908), Candia was part of the [[United Kingdom|British]] zone. At this time the ancient name of "Heraklion" was revived.

In 1913, with the rest of [[Crete]], Heraklion was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]]. Heraklion became again capital of Crete in 1971, replacing Chania.<ref>{{cite web

==Architecture, urban sculpture and fortifications==
{{Further|Fortifications of Heraklion}}

The oldest monument of architecture is the palace in [[Knossos]] on the outskirts of the city.

Two largest medieval churches in the city were the Dominican church of St. Peter (built between 1248 and 1253) and the San Salvatore, belonging to the [[Augustinian Friars]]. The latter one stood in Kornaros Square, but was demolished in 1970.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ilko |first1=Krisztina |title=Recovering the Augustinian Convent of San Salvatore in Venetian Candia |journal=Journal of Ecclesiastical History |date=2021 |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=259–263 |doi=10.1017/S0022046920000755 |s2cid=228866606 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/recovering-the-augustinian-convent-of-san-salvatore-in-venetian-candia/B19D763642F3DEA569F25FAF35813EE0#article |access-date=7 April 2021 |archive-date=21 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201121073124/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/recovering-the-augustinian-convent-of-san-salvatore-in-venetian-candia/B19D763642F3DEA569F25FAF35813EE0#article |url-status=live }}</ref>

Other monuments of architecture from Venetian times include the [[Saint Mark's Basilica, Heraklion|Saint Mark's Basilica]] and the Renaissance loggia next to [[Lions Square]] (1626–28).

Around the historic city center of Heraklion there are also a series of [[Fortifications of Heraklion|defensive walls, bastions and other fortifications]] which were built earlier in the Middle Ages, but were completely rebuilt by the [[Republic of Venice]]. The fortifications managed to withstand [[Siege of Candia|the longest siege in history]] for 21 years, before the city fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1669. The [[Koules Fortress]] (''Castello a Mare''), [[Fortifications of Heraklion|the ramparts]] and the arsenal dominate the port area.

Many fountains of the Venetian era are preserved, such as the ''Bembo'' fountain, the ''Priuli'' fountain, ''Palmeti'' fountain, ''Sagredo'' fountain and ''Morosini'' fountain in [[Lions Square]] (1628).

Architecture from the 19th century is represented by the [[St Titus Cathedral]], built in 1869 as the Yeni Cami ("New Mosque"), and the [[Agios Minas Cathedral]] (1862–95).

An example of modern architecture in Heraklion is the [[Heraklion Archaeological Museum]] built between 1937 and 1940 by architect Patroklos Karantinos.

Several sculptures, statues and busts commemorating significant events and figures of the city's and island's history, like [[El Greco]], [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]], [[Nikos Kazantzakis]] and [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] can be found around the city.

==Transportation==

===Port===

Heraklion is an important shipping port and ferry dock. Travellers can take ferries and boats from Heraklion to destinations including [[Santorini]], [[Ios Island]], [[Paros]], [[Mykonos]], and [[Rhodes]]. There are direct ferries to [[Naxos]], [[Karpathos]], [[Kasos]], [[Sitia]], [[Anafi]], [[Chalki]] and [[Diafani]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.directferries.co.uk/heraklion_ferry.htm|title=Heraklion ferry, compare prices, times and book tickets|access-date=2017-09-25|archive-date=2017-09-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925181402/https://www.directferries.co.uk/heraklion_ferry.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> There are also several daily ferries to [[Piraeus]], the port of [[Athens]] in mainland Greece. The port of Heraklion was built by [[Sir Robert McAlpine]] and completed in 1928.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Robert_McAlpine|title=Sir Robert McAlpine|publisher=Grace's Guide|access-date=16 December 2019|archive-date=16 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191216222535/https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Robert_McAlpine|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Airport===
[[File:Nea Alikarnassos, Greece - panoramio.jpg|thumb|260px| [[Heraklion International Airport]]]]

[[Heraklion International Airport]], or Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is located about {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=off}} east of the city. The airport is named after Heraklion native [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], a writer and a philosopher. It is the second busiest airport of Greece after [[Athens International Airport]], first in charter flights and the 59th busiest in Europe, because of Crete being a major holiday destination with 8,066,000 passengers in 2022 ([[List of the busiest airports in Europe]]).

The airfield is shared with the 126th Combat Group of the [[Hellenic Air Force]].

===Highway network===
[[European route E75]] runs through the city and connects Heraklion with the three other major cities of Crete: [[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Agios Nikolaos]], [[Chania]], and [[Rethymno]].

===Public transit===
[[File:Αστικό λεωφορείο Ηρακλείου 9277.jpg|thumb|250px|Urban bus in Heraklion]]
Urban buses serve the city, with 39 different routes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.astiko-irakleiou.gr/ |title=Iraklio urban buses |access-date=2015-02-23 |archive-date=2015-02-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224063554/http://astiko-irakleiou.gr/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Intercity buses connect Heraklion to many major destinations in Crete.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ktelherlas.gr/en|title=ΚΤΕΛ Ηρακλείου - Λασιθίου Κρήτης &#124; Online Κράτηση εισιτηρίων για λεωφορεία - Δρομολόγια Λεωφορεία Κρήτης|access-date=2017-08-27|archive-date=2017-08-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828104241/https://www.ktelherlas.gr/en/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Railway===
From 1922 to 1937, a working industrial railway connected the Koules in Heraklion to Xiropotamos for the construction of the harbor.<ref>Tzikas, Polykarpos; Konstantinos, Mamalakis; Tertipis, Dimitrios; Charitopoulos, Evangelos. «Μέσα σταθερής τροχιάς στην Κρήτη: Δίκτυα βιομηχανικών σιδηροδρόμων κατά το πρώτο μισό του 20ου αιώνα». Proceedings of the 12th International Congress of Cretan Studies.</ref>

In the summer of 2007, at the Congress of Cretan emigrants, held in Heraklion, two qualified engineers, George Nathenas (from Gonies, Malevizi Province) and Vassilis Economopoulos, recommended the development of a railway line in Crete, linking Chania, Rethymno and Heraklion, with a total journey time of 50 minutes (30 minutes between Heraklion and Rethymno, 20 minutes from Chania to Rethymno) and with provision for extensions to Kissamos, Kastelli Pediados (for the planned new airport), and Agios Nikolaos. No plans exist for implementing this idea.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

==Climate==
Heraklion has a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]). Summers are warm to hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by seasonal breezes. Winters are mild with moderate rain. Because Heraklion is further south than [[Athens]], it has a warmer climate during winter but cooler during summer because of the [[Aegean Sea]]. The maximum temperature during the summer period is usually not more than 28 - 30&nbsp;°C (Athens normal maximum temperature is about 5&nbsp;°C higher). The minimum temperature record is -0.8&nbsp;°C in the airport while in the port it has never dropped below 0&nbsp;°C. Snowfalls are rare with the last significant snowfall with a measurable amount on the ground occurring in February 2004.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ΠΑΤΡΙΣ - ΑΡΧΕΙΟ ΗΛΕΚΤΡΟΝΙΚΗΣ ΕΚΔΟΣΗΣ |url=https://archive.patris.gr/articles/27712/6337 |access-date=2023-05-25 |website=archive.patris.gr |archive-date=2023-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230525103949/https://archive.patris.gr/articles/27712/6337 |url-status=live }}</ref> Heraklion falls in 11a [[hardiness zone]].<ref name="meteo.gr">{{cite web | url=https://www.meteo.gr/Monthly_Bulletins.cfm | title=Meteo.gr - Προγνώσεις καιρού για όλη την Ελλάδα | access-date=2024-01-15 | archive-date=2023-02-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230202121511/https://meteo.gr/Monthly_Bulletins.cfm | url-status=live }}</ref>
