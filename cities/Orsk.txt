'''Orsk''' ({{langx|ru|Орск}}) is the second largest [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] in [[Orenburg Oblast]], Russia, located on the steppe about {{convert|100|km|sp=us}} southeast of the southern tip of the [[Ural Mountains]]. The city straddles the [[Ural River]]. Population: {{ru-census|p2010=239,800|p2002=250,963|p1989=270,711}} It lies adjacent to the [[Kazakhstan–Russia border]].{{Historical populations|1897|14000|1926|14000|1939|66000|1959|176214|1970|225314|1979|246667|1989|270711|2002|250963|2010|239800|2021|189195|type=|footnote=Source: Census data}}

==Geography==
The city is located where the Ural River turns from south to west and where the [[Or River]] comes in from the southeast (hence the name). It was part of the [[Orenburg Line]] of forts.

==History==
Orsk was founded (as [[Orenburg]]) in 1735 in the process of the [[Bashkirs#1735 Bashkir War|Russian colonization of Bashkiria and the Southern Ural region]].<ref>С.М.Стрельников. Географические названия Оренбургской области. — Изд. 2-е, доп. и испр. — Кувандык, 2002. — 176 с.</ref> The first settlement was founded by an expedition headed by [[Ivan Kirilov]] as a military fortification at the [[Mount Preobrazhenskaya]] on the left bank of the Yaik River (presently Ural River). Originally called Orenburg, its name was changed to Orsk in 1739. In 1743, the name of [[Orenburg]] was transferred to the town which is now known under this name; it is located {{convert|250|km|sp=us}} west of Orsk. At its foundation it marked a southeastern projection of European Russia toward the steppes of Central Asia. It housed an exchange post and Russian customs that dealt with traders from [[Kazakhstan]] and Asia.{{fact|date=October 2024}}

From 22 June 1847 to 11 May 1848, the fortress of Orsk was home of the exiled [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] poet and painter [[Taras Shevchenko]]. In 1861, the fortress was decommissioned and became a station of the Orenburg [[Cossacks|Cossack]] army. In 1865, Orsk was granted the city status and became the uyezd center in [[Orenburg Governorate]].{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The city grew dramatically starting from the 1870s. The population was mainly occupied with trade in cattle and grain, reprocessing of agricultural products, and various arts and crafts. Many women were involved in the business of weaving famous [[Orenburg shawl]]s. By 1913, the population of Orsk was over 21,000, and by 1917 there were eleven churches and minarets, and sixteen educational facilities of various types and levels. During the [[Russian Civil War]], from 1918 to 1919, Orsk withstood a three-month-long blockade and then four times changed hands between warring sides.{{fact|date=October 2024}}

In the 1930s, the construction of large industrial enterprises, which drew their resources from the mineral rich soils of the region, started. One of the most notable stones excavated within the Orsk city line in the [[Mount Polkovnik]] is [[jasper]]. Orsk jasper is revered for its variety of natural designs and colors. All colors except for blue are represented in this stone.{{fact|date=October 2024}}

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is, together with eight [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|rural localities]], incorporated as the '''[[City of federal subject significance|City]] of Orsk'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Orenburg Oblast|districts]].<ref name="Ref124">Law #1370/276-IV-OZ</ref> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the City of Orsk is incorporated as '''Orsk Urban Okrug'''.<ref name="Ref265">Law #2367/495-IV-OZ</ref>

==Economy==
Orsk is the most important industrial center of Orenburg Oblast. The main industries are [[metallurgy]], [[machine building]], [[Petrochemical|petroleum chemistry]], food and light industries. The most important enterprises are ''Yuzhuralnikel'', ''Orsknefteorgsintez'', and ''Yuzhuralmashzavod''. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], chronic under-investment, sanctions and lack of reforms led to the loss of 50,000 jobs and 30 plants, Forbes.com reported.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

===Transportation===
[[File:St.Orsk.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Orsk railway station]]
The city is served by [[Orsk Airport]] and there is an [[Orsk (air base)|eponymously named]] former [[Russian Air Force]] base located northeast of the city.

==Education and culture==
A branch of [[Orenburg State Institute of Management (OSIM)]] operates in the city. Other than that, there is one major institute in Orsk: Orsk' humanitary-technological institute. There are also a number of different schools and colleges, State Drama Theater, Museum of Local History, Laboratory of Archeological Studies, Children's Art Gallery, Children's Folk Theater "Blue Bird" and a municipal brass band.

Some of the landmarks of industrial Orsk are 40 archeological monuments including ancient settlements, mass and single grave sites. Those that have been excavated became famous in the scientific world. For instance, grave sites in [[Kumak]], that date back to the [[Bronze Age]] provide convincing evidence to the hypothesis of Eastern European roots of Indo-European peoples.

In the grave sites that date back to the early [[Iron Age]] (7th–6th centuries BCE) left by "[[Sarmatians|savromatian]]" or "[[Sarmatians|sormatian]]" tribes scientists found many ancient items including a clay vessel bearing the name of the Persian ruler [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes&nbsp;I]], the sixth such vessel found in the world.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
