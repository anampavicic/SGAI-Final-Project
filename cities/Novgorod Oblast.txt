'''Novgorod Oblast''' ({{langx|ru|Новгоро́дская о́бласть|Novgorodskaya oblast'}}) is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (an [[oblast]]). Its [[administrative center]] is the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Veliky Novgorod]]. Some of the oldest Russian cities, including Veliky Novgorod and [[Staraya Russa]], are located in the oblast. The [[Historic Monuments of Novgorod and Surroundings|historic monuments of Veliky Novgorod and surroundings]] have been declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Population: 583,387 ([[Russian Census (2021)|2021 Census]]).<ref name="2021Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2021Census}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:LakePeretno01.JPG|thumb|{{ill|Lake Peretno|ru|Перетно (озеро)}} in [[Okulovsky District]].|left]]
Novgorod Oblast borders with [[Leningrad Oblast]] in the north and in the northwest, [[Vologda Oblast]] in the east, [[Tver Oblast]] in the southeast and in the south, and [[Pskov Oblast]] in the southwest.

The western part is a lowland around [[Lake Ilmen]], while the eastern part is a highland (northern spurs of the [[Valdai Hills]]).<ref name="Darby">{{cite book

The major tributaries of Lake Ilmen are the [[Msta River|Msta]], which originates in the east of the Valdai Hills and collects the rivers in the east of the oblast, the [[Lovat River|Lovat]], the [[Pola River|Pola]], and the [[Polist River|Polist]], which all flow to the lake from the south, and the [[Shelon River|Shelon]], flowing from the southwest. The only outflow of the lake is the [[Volkhov River|Volkhov]], a major tributary of [[Lake Ladoga]]. Almost all of the oblast belongs to the river basin of the Volkhov. The exceptions are the northwest, which belongs to the river basin of the [[Luga River|Luga]], a tributary of the [[Baltic Sea]], the north, belonging to the basin of the [[Syas River|Syas]], another tributary of Lake Ladoga, the east, which belongs to the basin of the [[Mologa River|Mologa]], a tributary of the [[Volga River|Volga]], and the south, belonging to basins of various tributaries of the upper Volga River. Sorted by the discharge, the biggest rivers of the oblast are the Volkhov, the Mologa, the Msta, the Lovat, the Syas, and the Shelon.

The south and the southeast of the oblast contain one of the largest lake districts in European Russia. The biggest lake in the area, [[Lake Seliger]], is divided between Novgorod and Tver Oblasts. Other big lakes in the area include [[Lake Valdayskoye]], {{ill|Lake Shlino|ru|Шлино}}, {{ill|Lake Velyo|ru|Вельё}}, {{ill|Lake Piros|ru|Пирос}}, and {{ill|Lake Meglino|ru|Меглино (озеро)}}.

Two areas in Novgorod Oblast have been designated as protected natural areas of federal significance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oopt.info/index.php?page=53|script-title=ru:ООПТ Северо-Западного округа|publisher=Особо охраняемые природные территории России|language=ru|access-date=1 March 2011}}</ref> These are [[Valdaysky National Park]] in the southeast of the oblast, protecting the lake district and related ecosystems and cultural landscapes, and [[Rdeysky Nature Reserve]] in the southwest of the oblast, which protects the [[Polist-Lovat Swamp System]] and is adjacent to [[Polistovsky Nature Reserve]] in [[Pskov Oblast]].

==History==
[[File:Usobica.JPG|thumb|left|Battle between Novgorod and Suzdal in 1170, the icon from 1460]]

Novgorod is one of the oldest centers of Russian civilization. It lay on the historical [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]], which followed the Volkhov upstream to Lake Ilmen and then followed the course of the Lovat before eventually reaching the [[Dnieper River]]. Novgorod is indicated in the chronicles as the site where [[Rurik]] settled and founded the [[Rurik Dynasty]] in 862.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ketola |first1=Kari |last2=Vihavainen| first2=Timo |title=Changing Russia? : history, culture and business |date=2014 |publisher=Finemor |location=Helsinki |isbn=978-9527124017 |pages=1 |edition=1.}}</ref> Subsequently, Rurik's successor, [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]], moved the capital to [[Kiev]], but Novgorod continued to play an important role until the 15th century. In 1136, Novgorod evicted the prince and became the center of the [[Novgorod Republic]], which included the major part of what is currently northwestern Russia. It was an example of a medieval republic, in which decisions were taken by [[veche]]—a meeting of the city population—and the prince was elected. (The only other Russian city with a similar organization was [[Pskov]].) Novgorod linked the river routes of Baltic, Byzantium, Central Asian regions, and all parts of European Russia and flourished as one of the most important trading centres of eastern and northern Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://waytorussia.net/CentralRussia/Novgorod/History.html|title=Brief History of Novgorod in Dates|date=2018-08-27|website=Way to Russia Guide|language=en|access-date=2019-03-20}}</ref>  It was part of the [[Hanseatic League]] which connected it to Central and Northern Europe. Novgorod was one of the few areas of Rus not affected by the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasions]]. It was also an important cultural center, and the majority of monuments preserved in Russia from the 11th through the 14th century are those standing in Veliky Novgorod.

[[File:Jewellery Novgorod Slovenes GIM.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Jewellery decorations of Novgorod slovenes, 11–13 century.]]

Towards the end of the 15th century Novgorod was defeated by the army of [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]], the prince of Moscow, and was included into the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]]. In 1560, [[Ivan the Terrible]], fearing treason, sent his army to sack the city. This event, known as the [[Massacre of Novgorod]], had catastrophic consequences for the city, which lost the majority of its population and never recovered.  Additionally, in the beginning of the 17th century, during the [[Time of Troubles]], Novgorod was plundered by the Swedish army.

In 1727, a separate [[Novgorod Governorate]] was established. It was subdivided into five provinces, and the current area of Novgorod Oblast was split between two of them—[[Novgorod Province, Novgorod Governorate|Novgorod]] and [[Velikiye Luki Province]]s. In 1772, Velikiye Luki Province was transferred to newly established [[Pskov Governorate]]. In 1775, Novgorod Governorate was transformed to [[Novgorod Viceroyalty]], and in 1777, Pskov Governorate was transformed to [[Pskov Viceroyalty]]. In 1796, both governorates were re-established. By the 1920s, most of the area of current Novgorod Oblast belonged to Novgorod Governorate.

Before the 19th century, the areas around Novgorod were considerably better developed than the areas which are currently located in the center and the east of the oblast. In 1851, [[Moscow – Saint Petersburg Railway]], the first long-distance railway in Russia, opened. It bypassed Novgorod as it was built on a straight line between Moscow and Saint Petersburg. The railway construction lead to the development of the adjacent areas and eventually to creation of new towns such as [[Malaya Vishera]], [[Okulovka (town), Novgorod Oblast|Okulovka]], and [[Chudovo, Chudovsky District, Novgorod Oblast|Chudovo]]. Later on, the railroads between [[Sonkovo]] and Saint Petersburg, as well as between [[Bologoye, Tver Oblast|Bologoye]] and [[Pskov]], and a number of connecting lines, were constructed.

On August&nbsp;1, 1927 the governorates were abolished, and merged into newly established [[Leningrad Oblast]].<ref name="novobl">{{cite book|last1= Снытко|first1=О.В.|editor=С.Д.

Novgorod Oblast was an area of long and fierce battles, such as, for example, the [[Demyansk Pocket]], or the [[Leningrad–Novgorod Offensive]] in 1944, when the Soviet troops crossed the Volkhov River. After the liberation, on July&nbsp;5, 1944, Novgorod Oblast with the center in the city of Novgorod was established.

In 1999, the city of Novgorod was renamed Veliky Novgorod.

==Politics==
[[File:Novgorod - Oblast Duma and Administration.jpg|thumb|Oblast government seat in Sophia Square, completed in 1959]]

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Novgorod CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of Novgorod Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Novgorod Oblast is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].

===First secretaries of the Novgorod Oblast CPSU Committee===

==Economy==
===Industry===
As of 2014, industry was responsible for about 40% of the GNP of the oblast. The main industrial enterprises in the oblast are four chemical plants, all located in Veliky Novgorod and specializing mostly in production of fertilizers, a metallurgical plant, also in Veliky Novgorod, producing copper, and a plant in Borovichi producing refractory materials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metaprom.ru/regions/novgorodskaya_obl.html|script-title=ru:Новгородская область - промышленость и предприятия Новгородской области|publisher=«Индустриальный портал»|language=ru|access-date=18 August 2014}}</ref>

===Agriculture===
The main specialization of agriculture in the oblast is cattle breeding with meat and milk production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apk.nov.ru/giv.html|script-title=ru:Животноводство|publisher=Администрация Новгородской области|language=ru|access-date=11 May 2012|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707200540/http://apk.nov.ru/giv.html|archive-date=July 7, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2011, approximately 90% of the farms held cattle, and 79% of all agricultural production in the oblast were meat, milk, and eggs. A number of large-scale farms are keeping pigs and poultry. Bee-keeping, as well as cultivating of crops and potatoes, are also present.

===Transportation===
[[File:Kotovitsy bridge.jpg|thumb|Bridge on the [[M10 highway (Russia)|M10 Highway]] over the Volkhov River]]

Novgorod appeared as a site on one of the most important Middle-Age trade routes. The importance of waterways has considerably diminished since those days, but [[Lake Ilmen]], the [[Volkhov River]], and lower courses of main tributaries of lake Ilmen—the Lovat, the Msta, the Polist, and the Shelon, as well as [[Lake Seliger]], remain navigable.

The [[Saint Petersburg – Moscow Railway]] crosses the oblast from southeast to northwest. The major [[train station]]s are [[Okulovka (town), Novgorod Oblast|Okulovka]], [[Malaya Vishera]], and [[Chudovo, Chudovsky District, Novgorod Oblast|Chudovo]]. In Chudovo, one railroad branches off south to Veliky Novgorod, and another one north to [[Volkhov]]stroy and eventually to [[Murmansk]]. Another railway line, connecting [[Sonkovo]] and [[Mga]], runs parallel to the first one north of it. A line between Okulovka and [[Nebolchi]] makes a connection between the two. Additionally, Veliky Novgorod is connected by [[railway]] to Saint Petersburg and [[Luga, Leningrad Oblast|Luga]]. A railway crosses the south of the oblast as well, connecting [[Bologoye, Tver Oblast|Bologoye]] and [[Pskov]] via [[Parfino]] and [[Staraya Russa]].

The [[Kushaverskoye peat narrow gauge railway]] for hauling [[peat]] operates in the [[Khvoyninsky District]], and [[Tyosovo peat narrow gauge railway]] for hauling [[peat]] operates in the [[Novgorodsky District]].

The road network is well developed within the oblast, though only a small number of roads cross borders with Tver Oblast west of [[Valday, Novgorod Oblast|Valday]] and Leningrad Oblast east of Lyubytino. One highway of federal significance, [[M10 highway (Russia)|M10]], which connects Moscow and Saint Petersburg, crosses the oblast, running through Valday, [[Kresttsy, Krestetsky District, Novgorod Oblast|Kresttsy]], and Veliky Novgorod (there is a bypass of Veliky Novgorod). Highways connect Veliky Novgorod with Pskov and with Velikiye Luki, among other destinations.

[[Novgorod Airport]] and [[Krechevitsy Airport]] are both located around Veliky Novgorod, however, there are no regular passenger flights. Novgorod Airport is basically abandoned.

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Novgorod Oblast}}

The oblast is administratively divided into three [[city of federal subject significance|cities and towns under the oblast's jurisdiction]] ([[Veliky Novgorod]], [[Borovichi]], and [[Staraya Russa]]) and twenty-one districts. Another seven towns ([[Chudovo, Chudovsky District, Novgorod Oblast|Chudovo]], [[Kholm, Kholmsky District, Novgorod Oblast|Kholm]], [[Malaya Vishera]], [[Okulovka (town), Novgorod Oblast|Okulovka]], [[Pestovo, Pestovsky District, Novgorod Oblast|Pestovo]], [[Soltsy]], and [[Valday, Novgorod Oblast|Valday]]) have the status of the towns of district significance.<ref name="OKATO">{{OKATOReference|49}}</ref>

Novgorod Oblast has the lowest population for any oblast in the European part of Russia. One of the reasons for the relatively low population density, particularly the male population, is that the area suffered heavily during [[World War II]]. The population is 70.6% urban.<ref name="2010Census" />

''Ethnic groups'': Novgorod Oblast is relatively homogenous, with only three recognized ethnic groups of more than two thousand persons each at the time of the 2021 Census. In the 2021 Census, the following ethnicities were most numerous: 481,858 [[Russians]] (95.4%); 2,931 [[Ukrainians]] (0.6%); 2,498 [[Romani people|Romani]] (0.5%); 1,943 [[Tajiks]] (0.4%); 1,409 [[Belarusians]] (0.3%); 14,308 others.<ref name="census2021">{{cite web |title=Национальный состав населения |url=https://69.rosstat.gov.ru/storage/mediabank/%D0%92%D0%9F%D0%9D-2020_05.01.xlsx |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230810230407/https://69.rosstat.gov.ru/storage/mediabank/%D0%92%D0%9F%D0%9D-2020_05.01.xlsx |archive-date=August 10, 2023 |access-date=10 August 2023 |publisher=[[Federal State Statistics Service (Russia)|Federal State Statistics Service]]}}</ref> Additionally, 78,440 people were registered from administrative databases, and could not declare an ethnicity. It is estimated that the proportion of ethnic groups in this group is the same as that of the declared group.

==Culture and recreation==
Novgorod is one of the oldest Russian cities and was an important part of the [[Kievan Rus'|Old Rus]]. Like many Russian cities Novgorod preserved its own local characteristics of traditional [[Russian culture]]. Despite great damages, in particular, during World War II, a large amount of medieval monuments of art, archeology, and architecture survive. Many of those are included into the World Heritage site [[Historic Monuments of Novgorod and Surroundings]]. The majority of them are operated by the [[Novgorod Museum Reserve]]. The [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]] is the oldest Christian church in Russia with the exception of the [[Caucasus]] area. Since Novgorod was not affected by the Mongol invasions, it keeps a fair share of [[List of buildings of Pre-Mongol Rus|pre-Mongol buildings]], most of which are concentrated in the city of Veliky Novgorod and its immediate surroundings. The only pre-Mongol building in Novgorod Oblast outside the Veliky Novgorod agglomeration is the Katholikon of the [[Transfiguration Monastery, Staraya Russa|Transfiguration Cathedral]] in Staraya Russa, built in the end of the 12th century. Novgorod has, furthermore, a large number of architectural monuments constructed in the 13th–14th centuries, of which the [[Church of the Transfiguration on Ilyina Street]] is a representative example.

Novgorod developed a distinct school of [[Russian icons|icon painting]], which considerably affected not only the nearby Pskov and the Northern Russia which was dependent on Novgorod, but also in general the old Russian painting. The oldest survived Novgorod icons are dated by the 12th century. [[Theophanes the Greek]], one of the most notable old Russian artists, spent a part of his life in Novgorod, creating, in particular, frescoes in the Church of the Transfiguration on Ilyina Street. The [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] instrument [[Gusli]] was first recorded in the north Russian regions around the era of [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorodian Rus']].<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of music in Russia from antiquity to 1800. Volume 1, From antiquity to the beginning of the eighteenth century|author=Findeizen, Nikolai|others=Velimirovič, Miloš M., Jensen, Claudia R., Brown, Malcolm Hamrick., Waugh, Daniel C. (Daniel Clarke)|isbn=9780253026378|location=Bloomington|oclc=953789690|date = February 7, 2008}}</ref> The oldest [[Onion dome]]s which became a popular feature of [[Russian culture]] and [[Russian architecture|architecture]] originated among other regions also in [[Veliky Novgorod]].

The archaeological excavations in Novgorod and Staraya Russa unearthed over a thousand of [[birch bark manuscript]]s, used mostly to document various business issues. Currently, these manuscripts serve as the main source on the everyday life in the ancient Russia. Many medieval [[chronicle]]s originate from Novgorod, the first one being the [[Novgorod First Chronicle]], which covers the period between 1016 and 1471. In 14th century the Slavic-Nordic pirates [[Ushkuiniks]] spread in the Russian north and later in many other regions of ancient Russia.

After Novgorod was subordinated to Moscow in the end of the 15th century, its cultural significance gradually diminished. However, [[Valday Iversky Monastery]], founded in the 17th century, served as a major cultural center, and in the 18th–19th centuries many important figures of Russian history owned estates in Novgorod Governorate. For example, generalissimo [[Alexander Suvorov]], a Russian military commander notable for military operations against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and against the army of [[Napoleon]] in the late 18th century, owned the estate of [[Konchansko-Suvorovskoye]], currently in [[Borovichsky District]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.ru/M669|script-title=ru:Музей-усадьба А.В.Суворова в с. Кончанско-Суворовское|publisher=Российская сеть культурного наследия|language=ru|access-date=May 23, 2012}}</ref> and authors [[Gleb Uspensky]] and [[Nikolay Nekrasov]] owned summer houses in and near [[Chudovo, Chudovsky District, Novgorod Oblast|Chudovo]]. In 1862, the [[Millennium of Russia]] monument was erected in Novgorod to commemorate the thousand years of [[Rurik]] arrival to Novgorod.
