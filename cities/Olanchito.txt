==History==
The conquest of Honduras began with the arrival of several expeditions sent by [[Hernán Cortés]] to extend the domain of Spain in Central America. In 1525, he seized the town of [[Trujillo, Honduras|Trujillo]], which would later become an important Atlantic port and the first [[Capital city|capital]] of Honduras. Trujillo served as an outpost for the colonization of the hostile territory of Olancho Valley. [[Hernando Arias de Saavedra|Hernando de Saavedra]], Governor of Honduras, had a dispute with his counterpart in [[Nicaragua]] [[Pedro Arias Dávila]] over the rich gold deposits and rivers of Olancho. After several battles between rival Spanish groups for control of the area, the town of San Jorge de Olancho was established. The Olancho natives were mistreated, and unexpectedly rebelled and attacked the Spaniards; and Captain [[Juan de Grijalva]], one of the conquerors of the Aztec empire, was killed in the rebellion. In 1526, the survivors scattered; some went to the town of Caceres,{{clarify|date=February 2022}} and others to the [[Bajo Aguan|Valley of Aguan]].

With the death of [[Diego de Salcedo]], Governor of Honduras, in 1530, the province was in chaos, and the issue of extending the settlement and continuing the conquest of unsubjugated people continued. Accounts differ as to who founded the Olanchito settlement but according to the statistical yearbook of Antonio Vallejo, the town was founded by Captain Diego de Alvarado in 1530, with the name of San Jorge de Olancho.<ref>José Milla and Vidaurre. ''History of Central America'' continued by Gomez Carrillo, Chapter XI, p, 228, Vol I, 1879–1905 Guatemala</ref> According to Guatemalan historian José Mata Gavidia: "With these and other graces came to Guatemala D. [[Pedro de Alvarado]], for the year April 30. bringing people of Mexico, and some that found here in Nicaragua, Diego de Alvarado sent brother Jorge to find the city, called Olanchito, in the province of Honduras".<ref>Jose Mata Gavidia (1969) p, 136. Guatemala No. 189 C: A:</ref>

The town of San Jorge de Olanchito was founded in 1530 on the right bank of the Aguán river. Its first inhabitants were the few survivors of San Jorge de Olancho and others sent by Pedro de Alvarado, and it became a stage on ''El Camino Real'' (The Royal Road), which led from Truxillo to Olancho. In 1540, Governor [[Francisco de Montejo]] was ordered to continue the colonization of Olancho. He sent his officer [[Alonso de Cáceres|Alonzo Caceres]], who established a settlement named San Jorge de Olancho (Viejo). [[Alonso de Reinoso]] then founded the village of Nuevo Salamanca, which was rapidly depopulated due to continuing native attacks. Olancho was flourishing as a mining town, and produced huge amounts of gold and silver that were shipped from the ports of Truxillo and [[Puerto Cortés|Puerto Caballos]].

San Jorge de Olancho later became known as El Boqueron, and was completely destroyed in 1611. Historians attribute its destruction to a volcanic eruption or an earthquake; and some legends attribute it to divine causes, akin to the Biblical [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]. The survivors of this catastrophe migrated in several directions as their ancestors had done a century earlier. Some founded the city of [[Juticalpa]], and others went to San Jorge de Olanchito and Truxillo.

Over time, people moved to the left bank of the [[Rio Aguán|Aguán river]] and established a place they called San Jorge de Olancho (Nuevo) on the route leading to the native village of Agalteca. Because all of the town's residents moved to the new settlement, it was named San Jorge de Olanchito and the old site became known as the old city, or San Juan El Sevillano.

The exact date the present city of Olanchito was founded is unknown, though it may have been sometime between 1613 and 1620. As settlers colonized the upper valley and the road leading to [[Yoro]], the following sites were established: Santa Barbara in 1657 by Captain Pedro de Aliendo, and Subiñas and Santa Cruz in 1682 by Don José de la Cruz.<ref>"New Lands File Index" National Printing 2nd edition 1901. Tegucigalpa. p. 182 to 218</ref>

A report presented to the King of Spain by engineer {{ill|Luis Diez Navarro|es|Luis Diez Navarro y Albuquerque}} (1742–1745) said: "The capital is that city of [[Comayagua]], and has four cities named [[Gracias a Dios Department Gracias a Dios]], that is the West, [[San Pedro Sula]] at northeast, San Jorge Olanchito at Levante [east]&nbsp;... Forward the Partido of San Jorge Olanchito is [[Sonaguera]], and the Port of Truxillo twenty leagues distant"<ref>Manuel Sanchez Rubio. ''History of the Port of Truxillo'' Vol II p. 251 (1975) B: C: H: Printing shops Lopez y Cia</ref>

According to another document concerning the invasion of the English: "In 1747, the British themselves with [[Miskito people Miskito natives]] came to Sonaguera village, where they committed great crimes and would have done more damage but for the energetic attitude of Governor Tablada. So says the latter and adds that those foreigners who spared no means to intimidate Olanchito and Olancho El Viejo."<ref>''University Magazine'' No 1, p. 55, Volume VII Tegucigalpa 15 January 1915</ref>

In 1797, there was still a war between Spain and England with the following being reported: "In part this [[Captaincy General]] directed by the Lord Mayor Governor of the Province of Comayagua, Ramon Anguiano, from Olanchito early this month have reported the following: On April 26, before five in the afternoon, the British placed, two warships and a brigantine at Truxillo Port given these and other provisions they went to the place known as La Ofrecedora, which contributed effectively to the back the Governor Intendant, as expressed through a cordon of Olanchito troops who had settled in around Sona Guera".<ref>''Guatemala Gazette'', Wednesday 17 May 1797, Folio 113</ref>

Due to this situation, in the late 18th century, the archive and treasury of Real Hacienda de Truxillo were moved to the town of Olanchito, where it is still located to this date.
