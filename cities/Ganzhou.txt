=== Sui dynasty ===
In 589 CE, during the [[Sui dynasty]], the {{Interlanguage link|Nankang Commandery|zh|南康郡}} was abolished, and the area was reorganized as [[Qianzhou (modern Jiangxi)|Qianzhou]].<ref name=":0" /> During the [[Song dynasty|Song]], immigration from the north bolstered the local population and drove local aboriginal tribes into admixing with the northerners.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}} After the fall of the capital to the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] in 1126 in the [[Jingkang Incident]], immigration increased dramatically.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}

=== Song dynasty ===
In 1153, under the [[Southern Song]], Qianzhou was abolished, and re-organized as Ganzhou, the same name as the present-day city.<ref name=":0" />

=== Yuan dynasty ===
In 1277, under the [[Yuan dynasty]], the area was reorganized as {{Interlanguage link|Ganzhou Circuit|zh|赣州路}}.<ref name=":0" /> Near the end of the Yuan dynasty, in 1365, Ganzhou Circuit was reorganized again as {{Interlanguage link|Ganzhou Fu (ancient)|lt=Ganzhou Fu|zh|赣州府}}, which it remained until 1912.<ref name=":0" />

=== Qing dynasty ===
During the late 1800s Ganzhou was opened as one of the southern [[treaty ports]] and became a minor base for foreign companies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}

=== Republic of China ===
In 1912, the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] abolished the area's dynasty-era subdivisions, replacing them all with [[Counties of China|counties]] administered by the provincial government of [[Jiangxi]].<ref name=":0" /> In 1914, the province of Jiangxi was divided into four [[Circuit (administrative division)|circuits]] ({{Lang-zh|c=道|p=Dào}}), one of which being {{Interlanguage link|Gannan Circuit|zh|赣南道}}, which ruled the area of present-day Ganzhou.<ref name=":0" /> In 1926, Gannan Circuit was abolished, and its counties were again directly administered by the Jiangxi provincial government.<ref name=":0" /> In 1932, the province established {{Interlanguage link|Administrative Inspectorate|lt=Administrative Inspectorates|zh|行政督察区}}, and the area of present-day Ganzhou was split between the 9th, 11th, 12th, and 13th Administrative Inspectorates.<ref name=":0" /> In subsequent years, the area would be reorganized to be divided between various Administrative Inspectorates.<ref name=":0" />

==== Chinese Soviet Republic ====
Beginning in 1928, the [[Chinese Communist Party]] began operating in the area, and by June 1930, a local [[Soviet (council)|soviet]] had formed and began governing a number of counties in the region.<ref name=":0" /> In November 1931, the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]] was proclaimed in {{Interlanguage link|Yeping, Ruijin|lt=Yeping|zh|叶坪镇 (瑞金市)}}, in the then-[[Counties of China|county]] of [[Ruijin]].<ref name=":0" /> During the subsequent years, Ganzhou was governed by the [[Jiangxi–Fujian Soviet]].<ref name=":0" /> Beginning in February 1934, Communist Party forces in the area began to lose territory to [[Kuomintang]] forces ([[Fifth encirclement campaign against the Jiangxi Soviet|Fifth encirclement]]).<ref name=":0" /> From then until March 1935, the Soviet gradually lost territory with only five northeastern counties left in Ganzhou as of early October 1934 until it collapsed.<ref name=":0" />

==== Gannan New Deal ====
[[File:Chiang Ching-kuo in Gannan 10.jpg|thumb|left|Chiang Ching-kuo in Ganzhou]]{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2021}}
Between 1939 and 1945, [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], son of [[Chiang Kai-shek]], was appointed by the [[Government of the Republic of China]] as commissioner of Ganzhou Prefecture (mountain South), then the name of the surrounding regions of Ganzhou. There he banned [[History of opium in China|opium smoking]], gambling and prostitution, studied governmental management, allowed for economic expansion and a change in social outlook. His efforts were hailed as a miracle in the political war in China, then coined as the "Gannan New Deal" ({{Lang-zh|t=|c=贛南新政}}). During his time in Gannan, from 1940 he implemented a "public information desk" where ordinary people could visit him if they had problems, and according to records, Chiang Ching-kuo received a total of 1,023 people during such sessions in 1942. In regards to the ban on prostitution and closing of brothels, Chiang implemented a policy where former prostitutes became employed in factories. Due to the large number of refugees in Ganzhou as a result from the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|ongoing war]], thousands of orphans lived on the street; in June 1942, Chiang Ching-kuo formally established the Chinese Children's Village ({{Lang-zh|c=中華兒童新村}}) in the outskirts of Ganzhou, with facilities such as a nursery, kindergarten, primary school, hospital and gymnasium.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Diocese of Ganzhou |url=https://www.ucanews.com/directory/dioceses/china-ganzhou/615 |access-date=2023-05-13 |website=www.ucanews.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Chiang Ching-kuo and the Regional Planning of Gannan under the Influence of Soviet Experience (1941-1945) |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/268414945.pdf |access-date=2023-05-13}}</ref>

=== People's Republic of China ===
On August 14, 1949, the [[People's Liberation Army]] established control of Gan County.<ref name=":0" /> In June 1951, Ganzhou Prefecture ({{Lang-zh|s=赣州专区|t=贛州專區}}) was established.<ref name=":0" />

In February 1999, Ganzhou was changed from a prefecture to a [[prefecture-level city]].<ref name=":0" />
