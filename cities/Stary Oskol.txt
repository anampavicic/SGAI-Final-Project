==History==
Oskol was first mentioned in the Ipatiev Chronicle of 1185 as a gathering point for the troops of princes Igor and Svyatoslav in their campaign against the Polovtsians. Then Oskol as a city was mentioned in the list of cities of Svidrigailo in 1432. Then there are mentions of this city in 1497, 1506. There is information that in the 1430s the city was renamed Yagoldai-sarai in honor of the Tatar murza Yagoldai. The city is the capital of the Tatar principality. At the beginning of the 16th century the city was destroyed during a raid by the Crimean Tatars and was rebuilt on the site of the destroyed Yagoldai settlement by the Russian government of Tsar Feodor Ioannovich in 1593 under the ancient name Oskol.
It was near the [[Muravsky Trail]] used by [[Crimean-Nogai Raids|Crimeans and Nogais]] to raid Muscovy. In 1571 a fort was built nearby. It was abandoned after 15 years, but the area was still patrolled. In 1593<ref name="StarooskolskyCharter">Charter of Starooskolsky Urban Okrug</ref> Oskol was refounded as a fortress. In 1617 it was burned by the Poles. The surrounding area was frequently raided by the Tatars. In 1655 it was renamed Stary Oskol to distinguish it from the new fort at [[Novy Oskol]]. Later it was affected by the [[Russian Civil War]] in 1919, as well as by [[World War II]], when it was captured by [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungarian]] troops. After World War&nbsp;II, industry developed in the city and its population started to grow.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name Oskol remains unclear. According to historian Anatoly Pavlovich Nikulov, ''Oskol'' is of [[Turkic language| Turkic]] origin, since the lands of modern Stary Oskol in the early [[Middle Ages]] were part of the [[Khazar]] [[Kaganate]].{{cn|date=July 2024}}{{clarify|reason=What would the word have meant in Turkic?|date=July 2024}} Another hypothesis{{whose|date=July 2024}} likewise holds that ''Oskol'' is of Turkic origin and can be divided into two components: ''Os'' "Ros, [[Rus' people|Rus]], [[Russians]]" and ''kol'' "pond, lake, river." In Turkic languages, the sound of "r" is replaced by a softening of the next sound,{{clarify|date=July 2024}} so ''Ros'' would have been pronounced as ''Os''.{{cn|date=July 2024}} Another source{{who|date=July 2024}} assumes that ''oskol'' is of [[Slavic language | Slavic]] origin and means "splitting, crushing," a reference to the grinding of [[iron ore]] prior to [[smelting]]. The ancient city of Oskol was located in close proximity to a large iron deposit.[https://huji-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/att40d/972HUJI_ALMA21273296650003701]
