Gaia along with Porto and 12 other municipalities make up the commonly designated [[Porto Metropolitan Area]].

==History==

[[File:Camara Gaia 2.JPG|thumb|right|Municipal Council of Vila Nova de Gaia]]

Vila Nova de Gaia already existed under the [[Roman Empire]] as the city of [[Portus Cale|Cale]]. It developed most likely from a preexistent [[Celt]]ic [[Castro (village)|Castro]], or Neolithic settlement. The origin of the name Cale<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.faclair.com/?txtSearch=Cala |title = Am Faclair Beag - Scottish Gaelic Dictionary}}</ref> (or Gale, since in Classical [[Latin]] there was not always a clear distinction between the letters "g" and "c") is likely [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], from the root "Gall-" with which Celts referred to themselves, similarly to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Gaul]] or [[Galway]]. The river itself has a Celtic name, [[Douro]] (Latinised Durus) after Celtic "dwr", deep water, water or river.<ref>^ Matasović, Ranko (2009), "*dubro-", in Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic (Leiden Indo-European Etymological Dictionary Series; 9), Leiden: Brill, {{ISBN|978-90-04-17336-1}}, pages 107-108</ref><ref>^ Wodtko, Dagmar S.; Irslinger, Britta; Schneider, Carolin (2008), "*dʰeu̯b-", in Nomina im indogermanischen Lexikon [Nouns in the Indo-European Lexicon] (in German), Heidelberg: Universitätsverlag Winter, pages 122-124</ref> In Roman times the bulk of the population probably lived south of the river Douro, and on the north side, there was a smaller settlement around the deep water port which now is the [[Ribeira Square|Ribeira]] neighbourhood of [[Porto]]. The name of Porto, in high medieval times [[Portus Cale]], thus stood for the harbour ("portus" in Latin) of the city of Cale. With the important trade of the river Douro, which is easily navigable up to the [[Régua]] deep inland, the Porto part of the city came to overgrow Cale, and became the most important part of town, where the Bishopric and the merchants were established.

With the Moorish invasions in the eighth century, the ''de facto'' frontier between the Islamic state and the Christian one came to rest for a considerable period of time on the river Douro. With the constant raids and counter-raids, the town of Cale, or Gaia, was deserted and most of its inhabitants took refuge in Porto in the North side of the river. It is in this period, the tenth century, that the late medieval ''[[Lenda de Gaia]]'' (Legend of Gaia) is set.

After the conquest and pacification of the southern side of the Douro river after 1035, with the exodus or expulsion of the Muslim populations, leaving behind semi-abandoned fertile lands, colonists from the north settled in exchange for better [[feudal]] contracts with the newly appointed lords. These migrants refounded the old city of Cale or Gaia under the name of Vila Nova de Gaia (new town of Gaia) around the old [[castle]] and ruins of "old Gaia".

The name of the double city of Porto and Gaia was frequently referred to in contemporary documents as "villa de [[Portus Cale|Portucale]]", and the county of the [[Kingdom of León]] which was centered on it was named [[Condado Portucalense]]. This county was eventually expanded and after gaining its independence, became the [[Portugal|Kingdom of Portugal]].

==Parishes==

Administratively, the municipality is divided into 15 civil parishes (''[[freguesia (Portugal)|freguesias]]''):<ref>{{cite web|title=Law nr. 11-A/2013, pages 552 134-135|url=http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2013/01/01901/0000200147.pdf |access-date=4 August 2014|author=Diário da República|language=pt|author-link=Diário da República }}</ref>

==Coat of arms and flag==
The [[coat of arms]] consists of a grey crest with two golden-yellow bunches of grapes on the bottom with a black [[castle]] over the water, and with a person blowing the horn. The grapes intend to represent the city's connection with the [[Portuguese wine|wine industry]], mainly [[Port wine]], whose cellars are in the lower part of the city.

The flag features the coat of arms on a field of eight wedges ([[gyronny]]) of alternating dark yellow and black, beginning with the north-northeast octant.
