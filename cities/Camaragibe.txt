'''Camaragibe''' is a city in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern]] region of Brazil, in the state of [[Pernambuco]]. It lies within the [[Greater Recife]] — Brazil's 5th-largest [[metropolitan area]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-06-28 |title=Censo do IBGE: população do Recife encolhe 3,17% desde 2010 |url=https://g1.globo.com/pe/pernambuco/noticia/2023/06/28/censo-do-ibge-populacao-do-recife-encolhe-317percent-desde-2010.ghtml |access-date=2024-09-04 |website=G1 |language=pt-br}}</ref> 

Currently, Camaragibe is run by Nadegi Queiroz (from the political party [[Republicans (Brazil)|Republicanos]]) and Délio Junior (The Vice-mayor).

The lands now belonging to the city were used as a reserve of [[wood]], and then for sugar planting. It was populated by natives, until the arrival of Portuguese with [[Duarte Coelho|Duarte Coelho Pereira]], around 1500. After the Portuguese arrival, however, the natives were not completely driven from the area.

In the 16th century, the city (then just an [[engenho]]) was considered one of the richest in the region until the [[Dutch invasions of Brazil|Dutch invasion in 1645]]. At that time, the farm was burned to the ground by the natives. 

On 13 May 1982, Camaragibe, which was then part of the bigger city [[São Lourenço da Mata]], was elevated to the category of city.

The small city is considered among the most densely populated urban areas in the world because of the very accelerated growth that the city experienced from the emancipation until now.
