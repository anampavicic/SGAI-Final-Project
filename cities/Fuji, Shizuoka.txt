== History ==
In the [[Edo period]], the [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]] passed through the area that is now Fuji, with a [[shukuba|post station]] at [[Yoshiwara-juku]]. During the [[Edo period]], the area was mostly ''[[tenryō]]'' territory under direct control of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. With the establishment of the modern municipalities system of the early [[Meiji period]] in 1889, the area was reorganized into the town of Yoshiwara (吉原町) and the villages of Shimada (島田村) Denbō (伝法村), Imaizumi (今泉村), Motoyoshiwara (元吉原村), Sudo (須津村), Yoshinaga (吉永村), Harada (原田村), Ōbuchi (大淵村), Kajima (加島村), Tagoura (田子浦村), Iwamatsu (岩松村), and Takaoka (鷹岡村) within [[Fuji District, Shizuoka|Fuji District]].

Kajima became the town of Fuji on August 1, 1929. Neighboring Takaoka was elevated to town status on January 1, 1933. Shimada merged into Yoshiwara in 1940, Denbō in 1941, and Imaizumi in 1942. [[Yoshiwara, Shizuoka|Yoshiwara]] was elevated to city status on April 1, 1948, the city expanded through annexation of Motoyoshiwara, Sudo, Yoshinaga, and Harada villages in 1955 and Ōbuchi in 1956.

Tagoura and Iwamatsu [[Merger and dissolution of municipalities of Japan|merged]] with Fuji to form the city of Fuji on March 31, 1954. The city expanded through annexation of neighboring Ukijima and San area from Hara, [[Suntō District, Shizuoka|Suntō District]] in 1956.

On November 1, 1966, Fuji and Yoshiwara merged with Takaoka to form the new city of Fuji, which attained the status of a [[Special cities of Japan|Special City]] on April 1, 2001 with greater autonomy from the central government.

On November 1, 2008, the town of [[Fujikawa, Shizuoka|Fujikawa]] (from [[Ihara District, Shizuoka|Ihara District]]) was merged with Fuji.

==Government==
Fuji has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 32 members. The city contributes five members to the Shizuoka Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between Shizuoka 3rd District and Shizuoka 4th District in the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|lower house]] of the [[Japanese Diet]].

==Economy==
Fuji is one of the major industrial centers of Shizuoka Prefecture, and the city has hosted numerous [[paper industry|paper factories]] including [[Nippon Paper Industries]] (former Daishowa Paper Industries) and [[Oji Paper Company]] since the [[Meiji period]]. Other industries include food processing, metals and transportation equipment. [[Automobile parts]] manufacturer [[Jatco]] is headquartered in Fuji. Agriculture in the area is concentrated on [[green tea]] production and horticulture.

==Education==
Fuji has 27 public elementary schools and 16 public Junior high school operated by the city government. The city has four public high schools operated by the Shizuoka Prefectural Board of Education and one public high school operated by the city government. The city has one private high school and one private combined middle/high school. In addition, the prefecture operates one special education school for the disabled.
