== Etymology ==
There are various theories linked to the origin of the name Nellore. According to a mythological story from the Sthala Purana, the name is connected to a sacred lingam in the form of a stone found beneath a Phyllanthus emblica tree, also known as the nelli tree ({{transl|ta|nelli}}, meaning 'emblica tree' in Proto-Dravidian). The presence of the nelli tree in this story is believed to be one of the etymological roots of the region's name.

The more widely accepted theory is that the name "Nellore" is derived from the Tamil word "nellu", which means "paddy" or "rice." The region is renowned for its vast rice cultivation, and the name reflects its agricultural heritage and the importance of rice production in the area. Over time, the original Tamil name "Nelluru" evolved into the modern form "Nellore," used in both Telugu and Tamil-speaking regions.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Burrow | first=T. | author2=Emeneau, M. B. | title=A Dravidian Etymological Dictionary | publisher=Clarendon Press | year=1984 }}</ref>

Historically, the area was known as Vikrama Simhapuri during the reign of the Chola dynasty. The abundance of paddy fields eventually led to the name being changed to Nellore. The region has long been associated with agriculture, particularly rice cultivation, which continues to play a significant role in its economy today.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Sastri | first=Nilakanta | title=The Colas | publisher=University of Madras | year=1935 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Ramaswamy | first=Vijaya | title=Historical Dictionary of the Tamils | publisher=Scarecrow Press | year=2007 }}</ref>
