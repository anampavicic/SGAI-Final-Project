==History==
It was founded on October&nbsp;16, 1967, after an oil field had been discovered on a small forest clearing in the middle of the [[taiga]] marshland in 1961.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} The main and the only big enterprise in the city, ''Yuganskneftegaz'', was founded in February 1966. The name 'Yugansk' comes from the indigenous [[Khanty language|Khanty]] name of a small river near the city, ''neft''' means oil in Russian, and ''gaz'' is [[natural gas]]. The economy of the city remains [[petroleum]]-based, and was a major center for the Russian oil enterprise ''[[YUKOS]]'', which owned ''Yuganskneftegaz''. In fact, the "Yu" in "YUKOS" comes from the "yu" in "Nefteyugansk" and therefore from "[[Yuganskneftegaz]]". The other three letters come from the oil-refining factory "Kuibyshev-Org-Sintez", situated in [[Samara, Russia|Samara]].

On June 26, 1998, city mayor [[Vladimir Petukhov]] was shot dead on the way to his office. Before his murder, Petukhov had been on a [[hunger strike]] demanding that the chairmen of municipal and district tax offices be dismissed from their positions and a criminal case against Yukos be filed on counts of [[tax evasion]]. Petukhov's widow later on called for an investigation into [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]]'s role in events. Back then Khodorkovsky was head of Yukos.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} On September&nbsp;20, 2005 Dmitry Yegortsev, acting mayor of Nefteyugansk, was assaulted and wounded with a knife. After the stabbing of Yegortsev, [[Igor Gribanov]] took over City Hall as acting mayor. Just a few months later, he died of carbon monoxide poisoning at his home on January 6, 2006.{{ref|fire}}
