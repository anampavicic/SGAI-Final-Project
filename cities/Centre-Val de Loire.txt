'''Centre-Val de Loire''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|v|æ|l|_|d|ə|_|ˈ|l|w|ɑː|ɹ|,_|ˌ|v|ɑː|l|-}}; {{IPA|fr|sɑ̃tʁə val də lwaʁ}},<ref group="Notes">In isolation, ''Centre'' is pronounced {{IPA|fr|sɑ̃tʁ|}}.</ref> {{literally|Centre-Loire Valley}}) or '''Centre Region''' ({{langx|fr|région Centre|link=no}}, {{IPA|fr|ʁeʒjɔ̃ sɑ̃tʁ|}}), as it was known until 2015, is one of the eighteen [[Regions of France|administrative regions]] of [[France]]. It straddles the middle [[Loire Valley]] in the interior of the country, with a population of 2,572,853 as of 2018. Its [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] is [[Orléans]], and its largest city is [[Tours]].

==Naming and etymology==
[[File:Logo-Centre.svg|thumb|left|140px|Logo used until 2015]]
Like many current regions of France, the region of Centre-Val de Loire was created from parts of [[Province of France|historical provinces]]: {{lang|fr|[[Touraine]]|italic=no}}, {{lang|fr|[[Orléanais]]|italic=no}} and {{lang|fr|[[Berry, France|Berry]]|italic=no}}. First, the name {{lang|fr|Centre}} [[Placename etymology|was chosen]] by the government purely on the basis of geography, in reference to its location in [[Geography of France|northwest-central France]] (the central part of the [[Langues d'oïl|original French language area]]).

However, the Centre region is not situated in the geographical centre of France (except the [[Cher (department)|Cher]] department). The name was criticised as being too dull and nondescript.{{Citation needed| date=October 2012}} Proposed names for the region included {{lang|fr|Val de Loire}} after the [[Loire Valley]] (the main feature of the region) or {{lang|fr|Cœur de Loire}} (Heart of Loire).{{Citation needed| date=October 2012}} On 17 January 2015, as part of the reorganisation of French regions, the region's official name was changed to {{lang|fr|Centre-Val de Loire}}.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-01-17 |title=''Journal officiel'' of 17 January 2015 |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&dateJO=20150117&numTexte=1&pageDebut=00777&pageFin=00783 |access-date=2015-03-10 |website=Légifrance |language=French}}</ref> {{lang|fr|Val de Loire}} is associated with positive images of the Loire Valley, such as the {{lang|fr|[[châteaux of the Loire Valley|châteaux]]}}, the gentle and refined lifestyle, wine, as well as the mild and temperate climate, all of which attract many tourists to the region. A new logo was also created.

==Geography==

The [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 72.4 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 3.1% of French economic output.

The GDP per employee was 99% of the EU average.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018 |url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58 |url-status=live |website=Eurostat|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200417095003/https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58 |archive-date=2020-04-17 }}</ref>

An economic development agency, called ''Centréco'', was created in 1994 by the Regional Council of Centre to promote the inflow of investments and the establishment of new businesses by French and foreign companies in the Centre region. This contributes to a mission of economic promotion, international support to regional companies, and the promotion of regional agrofood products via a regional signature, ''du Centre''.
