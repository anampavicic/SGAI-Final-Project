==History==

{{See also|Timeline of Irving, Texas}}Irving was founded in 1903 by J.O. "Otto" Schulze and Otis Brown. It is believed literary author [[Washington Irving]] was a favorite of Netta Barcus Brown, and consequently the name of the town site, Irving, was chosen. Irving began in 1889 as an area called Gorbit, and in 1894 the name changed to Kit.<ref name="City of Irving - Irving Archives">{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofirving.org/1993/Between-the-Forks |title=Between the Forks |website=City of Irving – Irving Archives}}</ref> Irving was incorporated April 14, 1914, with Otis Brown as the first mayor.

By the late nineteenth century the Irving area was the site of [[church (building)|churches]], two [[cotton gin]]s, a [[blacksmith]] shop and a general store. The Irving district [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] system dates to the 1909 establishment of Kit and Lively schools. Population growth was slow and sometimes halting, with only 357 residents in 1925, but a significant increase began in the 1930s.

By the early 1960s the city had a population of approximately 45,000. A number of [[manufacturing]] plants operated in Irving, along with [[transportation]], [[retail]] and [[financial]] businesses. The [[University of Dallas]] in Irving opened in 1956, and [[Texas Stadium]] was completed in 1971 as the home field of the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. The [[Chateau Theater]] opened in 1964 as part of a chain of premium, dollar, and drive-in theaters that stretched across North Texas and Oklahoma.

[[Delta Air Lines Flight 191]] crashed in Irving on August 2, 1985.<ref name="FW Star Telegram - Delta Flight 191">{{cite web |url=http://www.star-telegram.com/living/family/moms/article3825884.html |title=After 25 years, D/FW Airport unveils memorial to Delta Flight 191 |website=Fort Worth Star Telegram}}</ref>

Irving's population reached 155,037 in 1990 and the United States Census Bureau estimated 236,607 residents in 2016, a 3.5 percent population increase over 2013 census estimates.<ref name="quickfacts.census.gov"/>

Prior to the November 2008 elections, Irving banned the sale of alcoholic beverages in stores, making it the largest in population dry suburb in North Texas. In 2004 the pro-alcohol measure failed with 63% of voters opposing the measure. In 2006, 52% voted against the measure. On the third attempt, with heavy monetary backing by retailers, voters narrowly voted in favor of the measure in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/politics/local/stories/DN-alcoholwrap05met.ART.State.Edition2.4a2bd44.html |title=Irving goes wet - narrowly &#124; News for Dallas, Texas &#124; Dallas Morning News &#124; Dallas-Fort Worth Politics &#124; the Dallas Morning News |access-date=November 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523132029/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/politics/local/stories/DN-alcoholwrap05met.ART.State.Edition2.4a2bd44.html |archive-date=May 23, 2009 }}</ref> People in favor of changing Irving's liquor laws saw the interest in the [[2008 United States Presidential Election]] as a catalyst for changing the laws in their favor.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122565413973491213 |work=The Wall Street Journal |first=David |last=Kesmodel |date=3 November 2008 |title=Irving, Texas, Alcohol Ban Faces Nov. 4 Challenge}}</ref>

In 2009 Irving had a city council that was entirely at-large. While Irving has a large population of racial minorities, the entire city council and the mayor's office, was entirely non-Hispanic White. Manny Benavidez, a resident of Irving, filed a lawsuit against the city in federal court in November 2007, saying that the voting system was not in compliance with the [[1965 Voting Rights Act]]. On July 15, 2009, a federal judge ruled that Irving is required to create a new electoral system so that racial minority representatives may be voted into office.<ref name="MannWhiteBurd">{{cite web |url=http://www.texasobserver.org/features/white-mans-burden |title=White Man's Burden – The Texas Observer |work=The Texas Observer|date=2009-08-19 }}</ref> In 2010 elections, which included one at-large seat and two district-seats, three new council members were elected, replacing two incumbents and adding a newly created seat.
