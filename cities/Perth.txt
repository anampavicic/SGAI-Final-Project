'''Perth''' ({{lang-nys|Boorloo}}) is the [[list of Australian capital cities|capital city]] of [[Western Australia]]. It is the [[list of cities in Australia by population|fourth most populous city]] in [[Australia]], with a population of over 2.3 million within [[Greater Perth]] {{as of|2023|lc=y}}. It is part of the [[South West Land Division]] of Western Australia, with most of [[Perth metropolitan region|Perth's metropolitan area]] on the [[Swan Coastal Plain]] between the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Darling Scarp]]. The city has expanded outward from the original British settlements on the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]], upon which its [[#Central business district|central business district]] and port of [[Fremantle]] are situated.

Perth was founded by [[James Stirling (Royal Navy officer)|Captain James Stirling]] in 1829 as the administrative centre of the [[Swan River Colony]]. The city is situated on the traditional lands of the [[Whadjuk]] [[Noongar]] people, where [[Aboriginal Australian]]s have lived for at least 45,000 years. Perth was named after the city of [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] in [[Scotland]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Founding of Perth |url=https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/founding-of-perth#:~:text=Perth%20was%20founded%20by%20Captain,roads%20and%20other%20public%20infrastructure. |access-date=18 October 2024 |website=National Museum Australia}}</ref> Perth was proclaimed as a city by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1856,<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of the Council |url=https://perth.wa.gov.au/council/about-council/history-of-the-council |access-date=2024-10-18 |website=perth.wa.gov.au |language=en}}</ref> although the [[City of Perth]] currently governs only a small area around the central business district. Substantial population growth occurred during the late 19th-century [[Western Australian gold rushes]], and the city has continued to expand, particularly after [[World War II]] due to a high [[net migration rate]]. [[Post-war immigration to Australia|Post-war immigrants]] were predominantly from the British Isles and Southern Europe, while more recent arrivals see a growing population of Asian descent. During the late 20th and early 21st centuries, a series of mining booms in various regions of Western Australia propelled Perth into the role of the regional headquarters for significant [[mining in Western Australia|mining operations]].

Ranked as one of the world's [[most liveable cities]], Perth was classified by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]] as a Beta [[global city]] in 2020. {{As of|2021|post=,}} Perth is divided into [[Perth metropolitan region#Subregions and local government areas|30 local government areas]], comprising over [[list of Perth suburbs|350 suburbs]]. The metropolitan contours span {{convert|115|km}} from [[Two Rocks]] in the north to [[Singleton, Western Australia|Singleton]] in the south,{{contradictory inline |section=Metropolitan area |reason=It can’t be both 115 and 125 km. Note that the cited source for one number is over a decade old, and its quantification of the population is demonstrably out of date. |date=June 2024}} and {{convert|45|km}} from the west coast to [[Sawyers Valley, Western Australia|Sawyers Valley]] in the east. Beyond the central business district, predominant urban centres within the metropolitan area include [[Armadale, Western Australia|Armadale]], [[Fremantle]], [[Joondalup]], [[Midland, Western Australia|Midland]], and [[Rockingham, Western Australia|Rockingham]]. Most of those were originally established as separate settlements and retained a distinct identity after being subsumed into the wider metropolitan area. [[Mandurah]], Western Australia's second-largest city, forms a [[conurbation]] with Perth along the coastline. Despite this, it is generally regarded as an independent city.

Perth features several important public buildings, as well as cultural and [[list of heritage buildings in Perth, Western Australia|heritage sites]]. The city has various notable government buildings, including the [[Parliament House, Perth|Parliament House]], [[Government House, Perth|Government House]], the [[Supreme Court of Western Australia|Supreme Court Buildings]] and the [[Perth Mint]]. The city is served by [[Fremantle Harbour]] and [[Perth Airport]]. It was a [[Naval Base Perth|naval base for the Allies]] during World War II and today, the [[Royal Australian Navy]]'s [[Fleet Base West]] is located on [[Garden Island (Western Australia)|Garden Island]]. All five of Western Australia's universities are based in Perth.

== Toponymy ==
The name of the city is taken from [[Perth, Scotland]] in honour of the [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]], and Member for [[Perthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Perthshire]] in the [[British House of Commons]], [[George Murray (British Army officer)|Sir George Murray]].{{Sfn|ps=none|Kimberly|1897|pp=44}}{{Sfn|ps=none|Crowley|1960|p=7}} Murray's association with the city was included in Stirling's proclamation of the colony, read in Fremantle on 18 June 1829, which concluded with the statement, "Given under my hand and Seal at Perth this 18th Day of June 1829. James Stirling Lieutenant Governor".<ref name="Stirling 1829">{{Cite wikisource|Lieutenant-Governor Stirling's Proclamation of the Colony 18 June 1829|date=18 June 1829|first=James|last=Stirling}}</ref> The only contemporary information on the source of the name comes from [[Charles Fremantle]]'s diary entry for 12 August 1829, which records that they "named the town Perth according to the wishes of Sir George Murray".{{Sfn|ps=none|Uren|1948|pp=88}}{{Sfn|ps=none|Statham|1981|pp=297–325}}

The current central business district location is within the traditional territory of the [[Mooro]], a Noongar clan, led by [[Yellagonga]] at the time of the British settlement. The Mooro was one of several Noongar clans based around the Swan River, known collectively as the [[Whadjuk]]. The Whadjuk themselves were one of a larger group of fourteen tribes that formed the south-west socio-linguistic block known as the Noongar (meaning 'the people' in [[Noongar language|their language]]), also sometimes called the Bibbulmun.{{Sfn|ps=none|Heritage Council of Western Australia|1998|p=3}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/15517921|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240101160600/https://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/15517921|access-date=2 January 2024|archive-date=1 January 2024|website=[[AustLit]]|title=First Nations of the South-West Region}}</ref>{{Sfn|ps=none|Government House|2020|p=2}}

{{Main|Swan River Colony}}
Despite the [[Colony of New South Wales]] establishing a convict-supported settlement at [[King George's Sound]] (later [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]) on the south coast of [[Western Australia]] in 1826, responding to rumours of potential [[Kingdom of France (1814-1830)|French]] annexation, Perth marked the first comprehensive European settlement in the western third of the continent of Australia in 1829. Officially designated as "Western Australia" in 1832, the colony retained the informal moniker "Swan River Colony" for many years, after the area's major watercourse.<ref name=srnsw>{{cite web |url=http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/2517 |title=King George's Sound Settlement |work=State Records |publisher=[[State Records Authority of New South Wales]] |access-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140624194804/http://search.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/2517 |archive-date=24 June 2014 }}</ref>

The strained relations between the Noongar people and the Europeans arose due to these events. Agricultural development on the land restricted the traditional [[hunter-gatherer]] practices of the native Whadjuk Noongar, compelling them to camp in designated areas, including swamps and lakes north of the European settlement. [[Hyde Park (Western Australia)|Third Swamp]], known to them as ''Boodjamooling'', remained a primary campsite for the remaining Noongar people in the Perth region, also accommodating travellers, itinerants, and homeless individuals. During the gold rush in the 1890s, miners on their way to the goldfields joined this community.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vincent.wa.gov.au/2/145/1/history.pm |title = Town of Vincent&nbsp;– History |work= Adapted from 'History of the Town of Vincent', from Town of Vincent 2001 Annual Report, p.52 (possibly based on J.

Perth entered the post-war period with a population of approximately 280,000 and an economy that had not experienced sustained growth since the 1920s. Successive state governments, beginning with the [[John Willcock|Willcock]] Labor Government (1936–1945), determined to change this. Planning for post-war economic development was initially driven by [[Russell Dumas]], who as Director of Public Works (1941–1953) drew up plans for Western Australia's major post-war public-works projects, including the raising of the [[Mundaring Weir|Mundaring]] and [[Wellington Dam Hydro Power Station|Wellington]] dams, the development of the new Perth Airport, and the development of a new industrial zone centred on Kwinana. The advent of the [[McLarty–Watts Ministry|McLarty]] Liberal Government (1947–1953) saw the emergence of something of a consensus on the need for continuing economic development. Economic growth was fuelled by large-scale public works, the post-war immigration program, and the success that various state governments had in attracting substantial foreign investment into the state, beginning with the construction of the [[Kwinana Oil Refinery|Anglo-Iranian Oil Refinery]] at Kwinana in 1951–52.<ref>{{Cite news |date=4 March 1952 |title=Agreement On Oil |work=West Australian |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49018574 |access-date=20 April 2022}}</ref>
[[File:Narrows_Bridge_EWD_c1959-100.jpg|thumb|Construction of the [[Narrows Bridge (Perth)|Narrows Bridge]] nearing completion in 1959]]
The result of this economic activity was the rapid growth of the population of Perth and a marked change in its urban design. Commencing in the 1950s, Perth began to expand along an extensive highway network laid out in the [[Plan for the Metropolitan Region, Perth and Fremantle|Stephenson-Hepburn Report]], which noted that Perth was beginning to resemble a pattern of development less in line with the British experience and more in line with North America.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Stephenson |first1=Gordon |url=https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-745050840/view?partId=nla.obj-745051291 |title=Plan for the Metropolitan Region, Perth and Fremantle |last2=Hepburn |first2=J. A. |publisher=Government of Western Australia |year=1955 |location=Western Australia}}</ref> This was encouraged by the opening of the [[Narrows Bridge (Perth)|Narrows Bridge]] and the gradual closure of the [[Trams in Perth|Perth-Fremantle Tramways]]. The mining-pastoral boom of the 1960s only accelerated the pace of urban growth in Perth.

The largest river flowing through Perth is the Swan River, named for the native [[black swan]]s by [[Willem de Vlamingh]], captain of a Dutch expedition and namer of WA's [[Rottnest Island]], who discovered the birds while exploring the area in 1697.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccentre.wa.gov.au/index.cfm?event=heritageIconsJanuary |title = 175th Anniversary of Western Australia&nbsp;– Heritage Icons: January&nbsp;– The Swan River|access-date =13 November 2008 |date = 31 December 2004 |publisher=Department of the Premier and Cabinet|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206041947/http://www.ccentre.wa.gov.au/index.cfm?event=heritageIconsJanuary |archive-date=6 December 2008}}</ref> This water body is also known as ''Derbarl Yerrigan''.<ref name="det-derbarlyerrigan">{{cite web | url=http://www.det.wa.edu.au/aboriginaleducation/apac/detcms/aboriginal-education/apac/regions/beechboro/history-of-the-swan-district.en?oid=MultiPartArticle-id-9430685 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224105521/http://www.det.wa.edu.au/aboriginaleducation/apac/detcms/aboriginal-education/apac/regions/beechboro/history-of-the-swan-district.en?oid=MultiPartArticle-id-9430685 | url-status=dead | archive-date=24 December 2013 | title=History of the North Metro Region | publisher=Government of Western Australia | work=Department of Education | access-date=27 August 2013}}</ref> The city centre and most of the suburbs are on the sandy and relatively flat [[Swan Coastal Plain]], which lies between the [[Darling Scarp]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. The soils of this area are quite infertile.

Much of colonial Perth was built on the [[Perth Wetlands]], a series of freshwater wetlands running from [[Herdsman Lake]] in the west through to [[Claisebrook Cove]] in the east.<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://edit.epa.wa.gov.au/EPADocLib/EPA-bulletin_372.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213083252/http://edit.epa.wa.gov.au/EPADocLib/EPA-bulletin_372.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 December 2013 |title=The Value of Wetlands |first=Norm |last=Godfrey |date=July 1989 |conference=Planning and Management for Wetland Conservation Conference, 15 June 1988 |volume=372 |publisher=Environmental Protection Authority |location=Perth, Western Australia |pages=4–11 |isbn=0-7309-1911-0 |access-date=11 October 2013 }}</ref>

To the east, the city is bordered by a low escarpment called the Darling Scarp. Perth is on generally flat, rolling land, largely due to the high amount of sandy soils and deep [[bedrock]]. The Perth metropolitan area has two major river systems, one made up of the Swan and [[Canning River (Western Australia)|Canning]] Rivers, and one of the [[Serpentine River (Western Australia)|Serpentine]] and [[Murray River (Western Australia)|Murray]] Rivers, which discharge into the [[Peel Inlet]] at [[Mandurah]]. The [[Perth-Gingin Shrublands and Woodlands]] and [[Banksia Woodlands of the Swan Coastal Plain]] straddle the metropolitan area.

Perth's population is notable for the high proportion of British- and Irish-born residents. At the 2021 Census, 169,938 England-born Perth residents were counted,<ref name="auto1"/> ahead of even Sydney (151,614),<ref>{{Cite web |title=2016 Census Community Profiles: Greater Sydney |url=https://quickstats.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/communityprofile/1GSYD?opendocument |access-date=25 February 2021 |website=Australian Bureau of Statistics |archive-date=8 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308055413/https://quickstats.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/communityprofile/1GSYD?opendocument |url-status=dead }}</ref> despite the latter having well over twice the population.

The ethnic make-up of Perth changed in the second part of the 20th century when significant numbers of continental European immigrants arrived in the city. Prior to this, Perth's population had been almost completely [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|Anglo-Celtic]] in ethnic origin. As [[Fremantle]] was the first landfall in Australia for many migrant ships coming from Europe in the 1950s and 1960s, Perth started to experience a diverse influx of people, including [[Italian Australians|Italians]], [[Greek people|Greeks]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[German people|Germans]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Croatian people|Croats]], and [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]]. The Italian influence in the Perth and Fremantle area has been substantial, evident in places like the "Cappuccino strip" in Fremantle featuring many Italian eateries and shops. In Fremantle, the traditional Italian [[blessing of the fleet]] festival is held every year at the start of the fishing season. In Northbridge every December is the San Nicola (Saint Nicholas) Festival, which involves a pageant followed by a concert, predominantly in Italian. Suburbs surrounding the Fremantle area, such as [[Spearwood, Western Australia|Spearwood]] and [[Hamilton Hill, Western Australia|Hamilton Hill]], also contain high concentrations of Italians, Croatians, and Portuguese. Perth has also been home to a small [[Jewish]] community since 1829<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Perth |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/perth |website=Beit Hatfutsot Open Databases Project |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot |access-date=22 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722155424/https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/perth |archive-date=22 July 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> &nbsp;– numbering 5,082 in 2006 – who have emigrated primarily from Eastern Europe and more recently from South Africa.

Perth's economy has been changing in favour of the service industries since the 1950s. Although one of the major sets of services it provides is related to the resources industry and, to a lesser extent, agriculture, most people in Perth are not connected to either; they have jobs that provide services to other people in Perth.<ref name="Structure2005">{{cite web|url=http://www.dtf.wa.gov.au/cms/uploadedFiles/structure_wa_economy_2005.pdf|title=Structure of the WA Economy|publisher=WA Department of Treasury and Finance|date=24 January 2006|access-date=10 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001203306/http://www.dtf.wa.gov.au/cms/uploadedFiles/structure_wa_economy_2005.pdf|archive-date=1 October 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

As a result of Perth's relative geographical isolation, it has never had the necessary conditions to develop significant manufacturing industries other than those serving the immediate needs of its residents, mining, agriculture and some specialised areas, such as, in recent times, niche shipbuilding and maintenance. It was simply cheaper to import all the needed manufactured goods from either the [[Eastern states of Australia|eastern states]] or overseas.

Industrial employment influenced the economic geography of Perth. After WWII, Perth experienced suburban expansion aided by high levels of car ownership. Workforce decentralisation and transport improvements made it possible for the establishment of small-scale manufacturing in the suburbs. Many firms took advantage of relatively cheap land to build spacious, single-storey plants in suburban locations with plentiful parking, easy access and minimal traffic congestion. "The former close ties of manufacturing with near-central and/or rail-side locations were loosened."<ref name="GreaterPerth"/>
[[File:Henderson Cliffs and Alcoa Kwinana Refinery, June 2022 05.jpg|thumb|[[Alumina]] refinery in [[Kwinana Beach, Western Australia|Kwinana]]]]
Industrial estates such as [[Kwinana Beach|Kwinana]], [[Welshpool, Western Australia|Welshpool]] and [[Kewdale]] were post-war additions contributing to the growth of manufacturing south of the river. The establishment of the Kwinana industrial area was supported by standardisation of the east–west rail gauge linking Perth with eastern Australia. Since the 1950s the area has been dominated by heavy industry, including an oil refinery, steel-rolling mill with a blast furnace, alumina refinery, power station, and a nickel refinery. Another development, also linked with rail standardisation, was in 1968 when the [[Kewdale Freight Terminal]] was developed adjacent to the Welshpool industrial area, replacing the former Perth railway yards.<ref name="GreaterPerth"/>

Increasingly it was these services sectors, concentrated around the Perth metropolitan area, that provided jobs.<ref name="GreaterPerth"/>

Perth has also become a hub of technology-focused startups since the early 2000s that provide a pool of highly skilled jobs to the Perth community. Companies such as Appbot, Agworld, Touchgram, and Healthengine all hail from Perth and have made headlines internationally. Programs like StartupWA and [[Business incubator|incubators]] such as Spacecubed and Vocus Upstart are all focused on creating a thriving startup culture in Perth and growing the next generation of Perth-based employers.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Startup WA |url=https://www.startupwa.org/ |access-date=2024-06-18 |website=Startup WA |language=en-US}}</ref>

[[File:UWAWinthropHallSunsetcurves gobeirne.jpg|thumb|left|The [[University of Western Australia]], located in [[Crawley, Western Australia|Crawley]]]]
Perth is home to four public universities: the [[University of Western Australia]], [[Curtin University]], [[Murdoch University]], and [[Edith Cowan University]]. There are also two private universities, the [[University of Notre Dame Australia]], and a local campus of the [[University of Divinity]].

[[The University of Western Australia]], which was founded in 1911,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uwa.edu.au/visitors/about/history |title=Visitors&nbsp;– History of the University |access-date=14 April 2007 |publisher=[[University of Western Australia]] |quote=The University of Western Australia has helped to shape the careers of more than 75,000 graduates since it was established in 1911. |archive-date=8 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208202255/http://www.uwa.edu.au/visitors/about/history |url-status=dead }}</ref> is renowned as one of Australia's leading research institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australianuniversities.com.au/rankings/|title=Rankings of Australian Universities 2016–2017 n|website=Australianuniversities.com.au|access-date=17 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408030955/http://www.australianuniversities.com.au/rankings/|archive-date=8 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The university's monumental neo-classical architecture, most of which is carved from white limestone, is a notable tourist destination in the city. It is the only university in the state to be a member of the [[Group of Eight (Australian universities)|Group of Eight]], as well as the [[Sandstone universities]]. It is also the state's only university to have produced a [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Laureate]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/australias-nobel-laureates|title=Australia's Nobel Laureates and the Nobel Prize |website=Australia.gov.au|language=en|access-date=17 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819205739/http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/australias-nobel-laureates|archive-date=19 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Barry Marshall]], who graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery in 1975 and was awarded a joint Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 2005 with [[Robin Warren]].

[[Curtin University]], previously known as Western Australian Institute of Technology (1966–1986) and Curtin University of Technology (1986–2010), is Western Australia's largest university by student population.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Curtin University on The Conversation |url=https://theconversation.com/institutions/curtin-university-873 |access-date=2023-07-16 |website=theconversation.com}}</ref>

[[Murdoch University]] was founded in 1973 and incorporates Western Australia's only veterinary school and, until its controversial closure in 2020, Australia's only [[theology]] program to be completely integrated into a secular university.

[[Edith Cowan University]] was established in 1991 from the existing [[College of Advanced Education|Western Australian College of Advanced Education]] which itself was formed on 11 December 1981 from the existing Teachers Colleges at Claremont, Nedlands, Churchlands, and Mount Lawley after Graylands had merged into Claremont, Churchlands and Mount Lawley in 1979. It incorporates the [[Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts]].

The [[University of Notre Dame Australia]] was established in 1990. Notre Dame was established as a [[Catholic university]] with its lead campus in [[Fremantle]] and a large campus in Sydney,  and a campus in Broome. Its lead campus is in the west end of Fremantle, using historic port buildings built in the 1890s, giving Notre Dame a distinct European university atmosphere.

The Melbourne-based [[University of Divinity]] established a campus in Perth in 2022 through its admission of [[Wollaston College]], the theological college of the [[Anglican Diocese of Perth]], as a collegiate college of the University.

Colleges of TAFE provide trade and vocational training, including certificate- and diploma-level courses. TAFE began as a system of technical colleges and schools under the Education Department, from which they were separated in the 1980s and ultimately formed into regional colleges. Two are in the Perth metropolitan area: [[North Metropolitan TAFE]] (formerly [[Central Institute of Technology]] and [[West Coast Institute of Training]]); and [[South Metropolitan TAFE]] (formerly [[Polytechnic West]] and [[Challenger Institute of Technology]]).

[[Alinta Energy]], which was previously a government owned company, had a monopoly in the domestic gas market since the 1990s. However, in 2013 [[Wesfarmers#Wesfarmers Chemicals, Energy & Fertilisers|Kleenheat Gas]] began operating in the market, allowing consumers to choose their gas retailer.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kleenheat Gas gives West Australians a choice of gas supplier|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/kleenheat-gas-gives-west-australians-a-choice-of-gas-supplier/story-e6frg13u-1226604439348|access-date=17 September 2013|newspaper=Perth Now|date=24 March 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528053138/http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/kleenheat-gas-gives-west-australians-a-choice-of-gas-supplier/story-e6frg13u-1226604439348|archive-date=28 May 2013}}</ref>

The [[Water Corporation]] is the dominant supplier of water, as well as wastewater and drainage services, in Perth and throughout [[Western Australia]]. It is also owned by the state government.<ref>{{cite web|title=The way we work|url=http://www.watercorporation.com.au/about-us/the-way-we-work|publisher=Water Corporation|access-date=17 September 2013}}</ref>

Perth's water supply has traditionally relied on both groundwater and rain-fed dams. Reduced rainfall in the region over recent decades had greatly lowered inflow to reservoirs and affected groundwater levels. Coupled with the city's relatively high growth rate, this led to concerns that Perth could run out of water in the near future.<ref name="RunOutOfWater">{{cite news | first = Eloise | last = Dortch | title = Plan for a second desalination plant | work=[[The West Australian]] | publisher=West Australian Newspapers Ltd | page = 1 | date = 7 May 2005 | quote = A document dated 12 January obtained by The West Australian under Freedom of Information laws shows that the Water Corporation fears Perth will begin running out of water by late 2008 without one of the two developments.
