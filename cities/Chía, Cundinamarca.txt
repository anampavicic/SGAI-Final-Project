'''Chía''' is a city and municipality in the department of [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] in [[Colombia]], located 10&nbsp;km north of [[Bogotá]] on the main road to [[Zipaquira]]. Due to its proximity to Bogotá, Chía has effectively become a [[suburb]] of the capital.

Its history dates back to the [[pre-Columbian era]]. Chia is also known for its gastronomy and its variety of restaurants.

It's also home of the [[University of La Sabana|Universidad de la Sabana]] one of the most prestigious in the country.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Portafolio |title=Las universidades privadas colombianas más destacadas en Latinoamérica |url=https://www.portafolio.co/tendencias/las-cinco-universidades-privadas-colombianas-mas-destacadas-en-latinoamerica-585374 |access-date=2023-09-25 |website=Portafolio.co |language=spanish}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The place name "Chía" in [[Chibcha language]] or [[Muisca language]] refers to the Moon as a star and as a goddess of the Muisca mythology, in whose honour there was a temple built in the [[Pre-Columbian]] town.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [http://www.colombia.com/turismo/sitio/chia/ Etymology Chía]</ref>

== History ==
Chía was inhabited first by indigenous groups during the [[Herrera Period]] and later by the [[Muisca people|Muisca]], as an important settlement in the pre-Columbian era. It was a ceremonial center of worship to the Moon goddess [[Chía (goddess)|Chía]]. On March 24, 1537, the Spanish, under the command of [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]], [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|took possession of the town]].

In 1781, during the [[Revolt of the Comuneros (New Granada)|Revolt of the Comuneros]], the march of the insurgents towards Bogotá stopped near Chía in order to cross the [[Bogotá River]], in what is now known as the Bridge of the Commoners  ({{langx|es|Puente del Común}}). At that site, the viceroy signed a series of concessions to the rebels. However, once the rebel group had dispersed, the viceroy declared the concessions invalid for having been signed "under pressure". It's widely believed that eventually [[Bogota]] will merge with Chia if the city continues to expand (as it happened with [[Bosa]] and [[Soacha]]).
