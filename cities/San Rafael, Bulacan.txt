'''San Rafael''', officially the '''Municipality of San Rafael''' ({{lang-tgl|Bayan ng San Rafael}}, [[kapampangan language|Kapampangan]]: ''Balen ning San Rafael''),  is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Bulacan]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 103,097 people.{{PH census|current}}

With the continuous expansion of [[Metro Manila]], San Rafael is part of [[Greater Manila Area|Manila's built-up area]] which reaches [[San Ildefonso, Bulacan]] at its northernmost part.

San Rafael is {{convert|37|km|sp=us}} from [[Malolos]], the provincial capital, and {{convert|60|km|sp=us}} from [[Manila]], the country's capital.

==Etymology==
According to a legend, the origin of town's present name San Rafael traces to a local fisherman. A few days after he had dreamed that he could heal, he successfully treated an ill neighbor using a fish's liver. Because of this, the news spread that he was indeed able to heal. When the Spanish missionaries arrived, they visited his house that was flocked by many people. Because of this, they named the place after [[Raphael (archangel)|Saint Raphael the Archangel]], the patron saint of healing whose name is in turn derived from a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word meaning "God has healed."<ref name="glimpse">{{cite web|url=https://sanrafael.gov.ph/aboutus/history|title=Historical Glimpse|website=Municipality of San Rafael, Bulacan, Philippines|accessdate=June 3, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bulakenyo.ph/etymology-of-bulacan-and-its-24-towns-and-cities/|title=Interesting Trivia for Today: Etymology of Bulacan and its 24 Towns and Cities|date=October 29, 2020|website=Bulakenyo|accessdate=June 3, 2023|lang=tl}}</ref>

==History==
===Spanish era===
San Rafael was established as a pueblo in 1750.<ref name="glimpse" /> The [[San Juan de Dios Church]] still stands as the silent witness of the bloody battles that the Filipino insurgents fought during the [[Philippine Revolution]] of 1896. This church was used as military barracks for almost three days, after the insurgents had destroyed all papers and documents they found in the convents.  When the Spanish Cazadores learned of these rebellious activities, they entered the church and fought the insurgents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spanamwar.com/spoobphil.htm|title=Spanish Order of Battle - Philippines|work=spanamwar.com}}</ref>  The combatants fought heavily inside the church to a point that blood was spilled all over the church floor.  The patio in front of the church was littered by dead bodies of Filipino insurgents. The gobernadorcillo ordered people to dig a common grave near the church for the bodies of the insurgents.

===American influence===
The Americans succeeded the Spaniards with their policy of benevolent assimilation.  Schools were established as a potent factor for pacification.  In 1903, schools were opened in San Rafael.  The municipal building was used as a school house.  Since then, with the supervision of the American administrators, San Rafael has enjoyed the education and the progress which was denied to them during the three–century rule of the Spaniards.

In 1899, the Americans incorporated the town to [[Baliuag]] when the latter was intended to be the new provincial capital of Bulacan. However, due to a number of petitions of the people of San Rafael, especially when the plan to make Baliuag the capital of Bulacan did not materialize, the Americans where convinced to separate San Rafael as an independent town from Baliwag. Julian V. Valte was appointed to be the first Presidente Municipal of San Rafael, and Emilio Reyes was the last. However, its incorporation to Baliuag pushed through, alongside [[Bustos, Bulacan|Bustos]], on October 8, 1903, by virtue of Act No. 932.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=932|date=October 8, 1903|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%20932|title=An Act Reducing the Twenty-five Municipalities of the Province of Bulacan to Thirteen|accessdate=July 3, 2023|website=Senate of the Philippines Legislative Digital Resources}}</ref> It was separated from Baliuag to become an independent town once again on March 21, 1907.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=1619|date=March 21, 1907|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%20932|title=Full Title an Act Increasing the Number of Municipalities in the Province of Bulacan From Fourteen to Fifteen, by Separating From Baliuag the Former Municipality of San Rafael, Giving the Latter the Territory Which It Comprised Prior to the Passage of Act Numbered Nine Hundred and Thirty-two, and Providing for the Distribution of Funds in the Municipal Treasury of Baliuag Resulting From the Separation From Baliuag of the Former Municipality of San Rafael|accessdate=July 3, 2023|website=Senate of the Philippines Legislative Digital Resources}}</ref>

In the year 1924 and 1927, with the help of some influential men, the Spaniards were able to get the signatures of the land owners of San Rafael and [[San Ildefonso, Bulacan|San Ildefonso]] to an agreement purporting to show their willingness to donate their lands to the Hospital of San Juan de Dios.

Thus the town of San Rafael and San Ildefonso became properties of the hospital and started to be called Hacienda de Buenavista until 1944, when it got back its original name.

===Japanese occupation===
The Commonwealth of the Philippines was invaded by the Empire of Japan in December 1941 shortly after Japan's declaration of war upon the United States of America, which controlled the Philippines at the time and possessed important military bases there. The combined American-Filipino army was defeated by April 1942.

In May, 1942, the Japanese government opened schools and introduced the teaching of [[Japanese language|Nippon-go]].  As part of its war drive, Japanese propaganda included phrases like "Asia for the Asians!" and talked about the perceived need to liberate Asian countries from imperialist powers.  Similarly, the Philippines were propagandized about "American exploitation," "American Imperialism," and "American tyranny," and blame was laid on the United States for starting the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psywarrior.com/JapanPSYOPWW2.html|title=Japanese PSYOP During WWII|work=psywarrior.com}}</ref> They were assured that the American forces would not return and that they were not Japan's enemies.  The effect of this was considerably undermined by the actions of the Japanese Army, and the Filipinos soon waited for the return of the Americans to free them from the Japanese. Japanese education condemned anything American, tried to infuse Japanese culture and to teach Filipinos the concept of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] under the Japanese influence.

Socio–economic, educational and religious programs were largely non-existent. The people were deprived of property, food, supplies and shelter. They were forced or resorted to eat [[camote]], wore [[jute]] sacks and tattered clothes.  The people of San Rafael evacuated to Upig, Licheria, Coral na Bato and Camachile.  Schools were closed and the church was ordered to stop performing its religious duties.

Guerrilla resistance against the Japanese continued throughout the war. Uncaptured Filipino army units, a communist insurgency and supporting American agents all played a role in the resistance. The people of San Rafael refused to be subjected to Japanese authority and they organized and joined small guerrilla bands and harassed the units of the Japanese army stationed in the town whenever there was a chance to do so.  These small, organized guerrillas in San Rafael later became members of BMA (Bulacan Military Area).

===The liberation of San Rafael===
When the American forces landed in [[Leyte]] in October 1944, the Japanese became more brutal. Hundreds met their death in the hands of the enemy.  One cruel incident occurred at Barrio Pulo. Men and women who were assembled where tied together, dynamites were strapped to many of them and these were later detonated by the Japanese captors. A lone survivor, Marcelo Mangahas, told the world of the gory incident.  Other atrocities followed.  However, the unity of the people of San Rafael and the heroism of the Filipino soldiers and guerrillas prevented further casualties and destruction.  When the Americans arrived, they found San Rafael liberated by the courageous guerrillas with the Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army 32nd, 35th and 36th Infantry Division and the Philippine Constabulary 3rd Constabulary Regiment that were mostly from San Rafael.

Local Filipino troops of the 32nd, 35th and 36th Infantry Division of the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] Army and 3rd Constabulary Regiment of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] liberated the town in San Rafael, Bulacan and aided the guerrillas of the Bulacan Military Area (BMA) and defeated Japanese soldiers and aftermath in World War II.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sanrafael.gov.ph/about/history.asp | title = Official Website of San Rafael, Bulacan | accessdate = 2011-09-08}}</ref>

==Geography==
===Barangays===
San Rafael is politically subdivided into 34 [[barangay]]s. Each barangay consist of 7 [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].

There are 5 urban and 29 rural barangays.
