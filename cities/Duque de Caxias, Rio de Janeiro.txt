[[Estádio De Los Larios]], located in the district of [[Xerém]], has a maximum capacity of 11,000 people and it is the home ground of [[Esporte Clube Tigres do Brasil]].

==History==
===Monarchy===
The settlement of the region dates back to the 16th century, to the establishment of the [[Captaincy of São Vicente]]. In 1568, Brás Cubas, provider of the captaincies of São Vicente and Santo Amaro, received, in donation of [[sesmaria]], 3,000 fathoms of tested land to the sea and 9,000 fathoms of bottom lands to the [[Meriti River]], cutting the paving stone of the village of Jacutinga. Another of the recipients was Cristóvão Monteiro, who gained lands on the banks of the [[Iguaçu River]]. The economic activity that gave rise to the occupation of the place was the cultivation of sugarcane. Corn, beans and rice have also become important ancillary products during this period.

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the administrative division of Iguaçu followed ecclesiastical criteria, that is, the church assumed religious and legal administration over the parishes. Thus, Pilar, Meriti, Estrela and Jacutinga, areas that currently occupy part of the territory of Duque de Caxias, belonged to Iguaçu. The region became an important point of passage for riches from the interior: the gold of [[Minas Gerais]], discovered at the time of crisis of the sugar plantation and the coffee of the [[Paraíba Valley]], which represented about 70% of the entire Brazilian economy at the time.

Since the roads on the mainland were few, precarious and dangerous, transportation was mostly done by river. The rivers were not lacking in the region and, due to its location at the Bay of Guanabara, many paths up the mountains towards the interior went through today's Duque de Caxias. The Port of Estrela was the most important landmark of this period. Around it grew a camp that, in the 19th century, was transformed into the municipality of Vila da Estrela.

After the decay of mining, the region remained a rest stop, supplying troopers, transshipment and transit of goods. Until the 19th century, local progress was remarkable. However, the relentless [[deforestation]] caused the obstruction and overflowing of the rivers, which favored the formation of marshland. The still and polluted waters led to the spread of disease-carrying mosquitoes.

The location was rendered practically uninhabitable, and little remained of the population. The previously fertile lands were covered with [[mangrove]] vegetation. In 1850, epidemics arose, forcing {{lang|pt|senhores de engenho}} to flee to safer places. Many properties were abandoned, and Duque de Caxias would remain in shambles for some decades.

With the introduction of rail transport, the situation has deteriorated considerably. The [[Central do Brasil|D. Pedro II Railway]] linked the capital of the [[Brazilian Empire]] to the current municipality of [[Queimados]]. The production of the Paraíba Valley began to be disposed of by this route, rivers and land transportation were gradually abandoned and the river ports lost their importance. The region of Equatorial Guinea fell into sharp decline.

With the [[Golden Law|abolition of slavery]] in 1888, several changes occurred in the economic and social life of the [[Baixada Fluminense]]. The sanitation works were abandoned, there was a delay in the conditions conducive to health and several diseases arose. Among them, [[Malaria]] and [[Chagas disease]].

===Republic===
Under the government of [[Nilo Peçanha]], Meriti had a timid improvement in the area of basic sanitation, counting, even, with the arrival of the piped water, in 1916, in the present land of the ''Pacificador''. But only in the government of [[Getúlio Vargas]], who created the Sanitation Commission of the Baixada Fluminense, the region has advanced. By 1945, more than 6,000 kilometers of rivers were cleared, taking 45,000,000 cubic meters of land from their beds. With this work, the rivers ceased to be mosquito breeding sites, greatly reducing the number of diseases in the region.

When the railroad hit the Meriti Valley, the region began to suffer the effects of [[urban sprawl]] in the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. With the inauguration of Rio de Janeiro North Railway, on 23 April 1886, the region was definitively linked to the former Federal District. With the inauguration of new stations in 1911 by the Leopoldina Railway, the number of passengers and the number of passengers in Gramacho, São Bento, Actura (Campos Elísios), Primavera and Saracuruna neighbourhoods were multiplied.

However, despite this recovery that the railroad had brought, the lowlands continued to suffer from a lack of sanitation, a factor that stagnated their progress. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the lowlands served to alleviate the demographic pressures of the city of Rio de Janeiro. Statistical data show that in 1910, the population was eight hundred people in Meriti, moving in 1920 to 2920. The rapid population growth caused the fractionation and the subdivision of the former rural properties, at that moment, unproductive. Only in 1924, the first electricity grid was installed in the municipality. With the opening of the Rio-Petrópolis Highway in 1928, Meriti once again prospered. Numerous companies bought land and settled in the region because of the proximity to Rio de Janeiro.

The process of emancipation of the city was related to the formation of a group that organized the Popular Caxiense Union (UPC): journalists, doctors and local politicians. In 1940, the pro-emancipation commission was created: Sylvio Goulart, Rufino Gomes, Amadeu Lanzeloti, Joaquim Linhares, José Basílio, Carlos Fraga and Antônio Moreira. The reaction of the government was immediate and the demonstrators were arrested.

In the 1940s, the federal government promoted the cleaning of more than 6,000 kilometers of rivers and built more than two hundred bridges in the Baixada Fluminense.

The great growth through which Meriti passed, led Federal Representative Manuel Reis to propose the creation of the District of Caxias. On 14 March 1931, through the act of the interventor Plínio de Castro Casado, the District of Caxias was created by State Decree No. 2,559, with headquarters in the former Meriti Station, belonging to the then municipality of Nova Iguaçu. On December 31, 1943, through Decree-Law 1055, it was renamed the Municipality, receiving the name Duque de Caxias. The Duque de Caxias region was created by Decree-Law No. 0556, on the same day, month and year. With the emancipation, the municipality received great incentive in its economy. Several people, mainly from the Northeast Region of Brazil, arrived in Rio de Janeiro in search of work and settled in Duque de Caxias. The executive power was officially installed on 1 January 1944.

After the military dictatorship, a great deal of political, business, trade union, and community leadership, the municipality gained its autonomy in 1985.

==Geography==
[[File:Represa do Garrão, Xerém, Duque de Caxias.jpg|thumb|Garrao dam in xerém. The fourth district of the city is situated on the ascent of the Serra Fluminense.]]
