==Etymology==
{{see also|Lombardy (historical region)}}
[[File:Map of Historical Lombardy.png|thumb|Map of [[Lombardy (historical region)|Historical Lombardy]]]]

The [[Lombardy (historical region)|name ''Lombardy'']] comes from ''Lombard'', which is derived from [[Late Latin]] ''{{lang|la|Longobardus, Langobardus}}'' ("a Lombard"), which derived from the [[Proto-Germanic]] elements {{lang|mis|*langaz}} + {{lang|mis|*bardaz}}; equivalent to ''long beard''. According to some scholars, the second element derives from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*bardǭ'', ''*barduz'' ("axe"), related to German ''{{lang|de|Barte}}''.<ref name="Partridge 2009">{{cite book|last=Partridge|first=Eric|title=Origins: an etymological dictionary of modern English|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415474337|edition=[Paperback ed.]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Online Etymology Dictionary |title=Lombard |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/Lombardy |website=etymonline.com |access-date=12 July 2024 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Istituto della Enciclopedia Italianafondata da Giovanni Treccani |title=Lombardia |url=https://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/lombardia/ |website=treccani.it |publisher=Istituto della Enciclopedia Italianafondata da Giovanni Treccani |access-date=12 July 2024 |language=it}}</ref>

The name of the region derives from the name of the people of the [[Lombards]] who arrived in Italy in 568 and made [[Pavia]] their capital. During the [[Early Middle Ages]], "Lombardy" referred to the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] ({{langx|la|Regnum Langobardorum}}), which was ruled by the Germanic Lombard raiders who had controlled most of early Christian Italy since [[Lombard invasion of Italy|their invasion]] of [[Praetorian prefecture of Italy|Byzantine Italy]] in CE 568 until the fall of Pavia on the river [[Ticino (river)|Ticino]], in CE 774 by the Frankish [[Charlemagne]] on the Pope's behalf. As such, "Lombardy" and "Italy" were almost interchangeable; by the mid-8th century, the Lombards ruled everywhere except the [[Papal States|Papal possessions around Rome]]—roughly modern [[Lazio]] and northern [[Umbria]]—[[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and some [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] possessions in the south—southern [[Apulia]] and [[Calabria]]; some coastal settlements including [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]], [[Duchy of Gaeta|Gaeta]], [[Duchy of Naples|Naples]] and [[Duchy of Sorrento|Sorrento]]; [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]]; their culture is foundational to [[Italy in the Middle Ages]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mondimedievali.net/Barbar/longobardi02.htm|title=I Longobardi: i 'barbari' che fondarono il Medioevo italiano, II: Una civiltà da riscoprire, di Lawrence M.F. Sudbury, BarBar|website=Mondimedievali.net}}</ref> The term was also used until around 965 in the form {{lang|el|Λογγοβαρδία}} (''{{transliteration|el|Longobardia}}'') as the name for [[Longobardia|the territory]] roughly covering modern Apulia, which the Byzantines had recovered from the Lombard [[rump state]] [[Duchy of Benevento]].

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Lombardy}}
Lombardy has a surface area of {{cvt|23861|km2|0}}, and is the fourth-largest [[Regions of Italy|region of Italy]] after [[Sicily]], [[Piedmont]] and [[Sardinia]].<ref name="tuttitalia">{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttitalia.it/regioni/superficie/|title=Regioni d'Italia in ordine di superficie.|archive-date=15 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215125411/https://www.tuttitalia.it/regioni/superficie/|language=it|access-date=8 February 2024}}</ref> It is bordered by [[Canton Ticino]] and [[Grisons|Canton Grisons]] of [[Switzerland]] to the north, and by the Italian regions of [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]] and [[Veneto]] to the east, [[Emilia-Romagna]] to the south and [[Piedmont]] to the west. 

Lombardy's northern border is between the [[Valtellina]] and the valleys of the [[Rhine]] and the [[Inn (river)|Inn]]. To the east, [[Lake Garda]] and the [[Mincio]] separate Lombardy from the other Italian regions, as does the Po river in the south with the exception of the [[province of Mantua]] and [[Oltrepò Pavese]]. The western boundary is formed by the [[Lake Maggiore]] and the [[Ticino (river)|Ticino]] river, except [[Lomellina]]. Lombardy has three natural zones; mountains, hills and plains—the last being divided into ''Alta'' (high plains) and ''Bassa'' (low plains).

===Soils===
[[File:Passo Manina e Coca.JPG|thumbnail|[[Pizzo Coca]] is the highest peak in the [[Bergamasque Alps|Orobic Alps]] ({{cvt|3050|m|ft}}).]]

The surface area of Lombardy is divided almost equally between the plains (which represent approximately 47% of the territory) and the mountainous areas (which represent 41%). The remaining 12% of the region is hilly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalgeografia.com/italia/lombardia.htm|title=Globalgeografia|access-date=1 August 2012|language=it}}</ref>

The [[orography]] of Lombardy is characterised by three distinct belts; a northern mountainous belt constituted by the Alpine relief, a central piedmont area of mostly alluvial pebbly soils, and the Lombard section of the [[Padan Plain]] in the south of the region. The main valleys are [[Val Camonica]], [[Val Trompia]], [[Valle Sabbia]], [[Valtellina]], [[Val Seriana]], [[Val Brembana]], [[Valsassina]], and [[Valassina]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.regione.lombardia.it/wps/portal/istituzionale/HP/DettaglioRedazionale/scopri-la-lombardia/territorio-e-popolazione/territorio+e+popolazione|title=Territorio e popolazione|access-date=4 November 2020|language=it}}</ref>

The most important mountainous area is the [[Alps|Alpine]] zone, which includes the [[Lepontine Alps|Lepontine]] and [[Rhaetian Alps]] ({{cvt|4020|m|ft}}), which derive their name, respectively, from the [[Rhaetian people|Raeti]], a population of [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] origin who took refuge in the Central Alps during the Celtic invasion of the Italian peninsula, and from the [[Ligures|Ligurian]] population of the [[Lepontii]] settled in this area and then subjugated by the Roman emperor [[Augustus]],<ref name=".montagnadilombardia">{{cite web|url=http://www.montagnadilombardia.com/alpi.html|title=Origine del nome delle Alpi lombarde|access-date=30 March 2013|language=it}}</ref> the [[Bergamasque Alps|Orobic Alps]] ({{cvt|3050|m|ft}}) which derive their name from the [[Orobii]], population of Ligurian or perhaps Celtic origin,<ref name=".montagnadilombardia"/> the [[Ortler Alps]] and the [[Adamello]] massif. It is followed by the Alpine foothills zone [[Prealps]], which are followed by hills that smooth the transition from the mountain to the [[Po Valley]], the main peaks of which are the [[Grigna]] Group ({{cvt|2410|m|ft}}), [[Resegone]] {{cvt|1875|m|ft}}, and [[Presolana]] ({{cvt|2521|m|ft}}).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lombardy Mountains |url=https://peakvisor.com/adm/lombardy.html |access-date=19 June 2022|website=PeakVisor}}</ref>

The plains of Lombardy, which are formed by alluvial deposits, can be divided into the ''Alta''—an upper, permeable ground zone in the north—and the ''Bassa'', a lower zone dotted by the line of ''fontanili'', spring waters rising from impermeable ground. Inconsistent with the three distinctions above is the small sub-region of [[Oltrepò Pavese]], which is formed by the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennine]] foothills beyond the [[Po (river)|Po]], <ref name="oltresentieri">{{Cite web |title=Oltrepò Pavese, Geologia |url=http://www.oltresentieri.com/Cultura/DaVedere/OltrepoPaveseGeologia.html |access-date=31 January 2024|language=it}}</ref> and [[Lomellina]], area particularly renowned for its [[rice paddies]].

[[File:Sentiero del Viandante DSC 6340 (14020554463).jpg|thumb|Panoramic view of [[Lake Como]] with the [[Alps]] and [[Bellagio, Lombardy|Bellagio]]]]

The Po marks the southern border of the region for about {{cvt|210|km|0}}; its major tributaries are the [[Ticino (river)|Ticino]], which rises in the Val Bedretto in [[Switzerland]] and joins the Po near Pavia,<ref>{{cite book|author1=Rodolfo Soncini-Sessa|author2=Enrico Weber|author3=Francesca Cellina|author4=Francesca Pianosi|title=Integrated and Participatory Water Resources Management - Practice|publisher=Elsevier Science|year=2007|isbn=9780080551425|page=40}}</ref> the [[Olona]], the [[Lambro]], the [[Adda (river)|Adda]], the [[Oglio]] and the [[Mincio]].

The numerous lakes of Lombardy are all of glacial origin and are located in the northern highlands. From west to east, these are: [[Lake Maggiore]], [[Lake Lugano]] (both shared with Switzerland), [[Lake Como]], [[Lake Iseo]], [[Lake Idro]], and [[Lake Garda]] (the largest lake in Italy).<ref>[[Gabriel Faure (writer)|Gabriel Faure]] (1923). ''The Italian Lakes: Maggiore, Como, Orta, Varese, Lugano, Iseo, Garda''</ref> South of the Alps are a succession of low hills of [[Moraine|morainic]] origin that were formed during the [[Last Glacial Period]] and small, barely fertile plateaux with typical heaths and conifer woods. A minor mountainous area the [[Oltrepò Pavese]] lies in the [[Apennines]] range south of the Po.<ref name="oltresentieri"/>

The [[navigli]] are a system of interconnected [[canal]]s in and around [[Milan]] dating back as far as the Middle Ages.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Florensa |first=Lídia |title=Navigli: guía para visitar los canales de Milán |url=https://www.viajarmilan.com/visitar-los-canales-navigli.php |access-date=7 February 2023|website=Viajar Milán |language=es}}</ref> The system consists of five canals: [[Naviglio Grande]], [[Naviglio Pavese]], [[Naviglio Martesana]], [[Naviglio di Paderno]], [[Naviglio di Bereguardo]]. The first three were connected through Milan via the ''Fossa Interna'', also known as the Inner Ring. The urban section of the [[Naviglio Martesana]] was covered over at the beginning of the 1930s, together with the entire Inner Ring, thus sounding the death knell for the north-eastern canals.

===Alpine passes===
[[File:Splügenpass Nordseite.jpg|thumb|The northern side of the [[Splügen Pass]]]]

The Lombard Alpine valleys are wider than those found, again in the [[Alps]], in [[Piedmont]] and [[Aosta Valley]]. Most of them are crossed by streams that descend towards the [[Po Valley]], forming rivers which then flow into the Po on the hydrographic left. Thanks to the width of their valleys, the Lombard Alpine passes, although they are at a high altitude, are easily accessible.

The most important international passes found in the Lombard Alps and which connect the region with [[Switzerland]] are the [[Splügen Pass]] ({{cvt|2118|m|ft}}), the [[Maloja Pass]] ({{cvt|1,815|m|ft}}) and the [[Bernina Pass]] ({{cvt|2323|m|ft}}), with the latter two which are located in Swiss territory. The most important national passes are the [[Stelvio Pass]] ({{cvt|2759|m|ft}}) and the [[Tonale Pass]] ({{cvt|1,883|m|ft}}), which connect Lombardy with [[Trentino-Alto Adige]]. These Alpine passes are also of great importance from a historical point of view, given that they have always allowed easy communication between Lombardy and its bordering territories. It then resulted in constant commercial traffic, which contributed to the development of the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lebellezzeditalia.it/lombardia/lombardia_it/lombardia.htm|title=Lombardia|access-date=27 November 2017|language=it}}</ref>

===Flora and fauna===
[[File:Aree protette della Lombardia.svg|thumb|The protected areas of Lombardy]]

The plains have been intensively cultivated for centuries, and little of the original environment remains. The most common trees are [[elm]], [[alder]], [[sycamore]], [[Populus|poplar]], [[willow]] and [[hornbeam]]. In the area of the foothills lakes, however, [[olive]], [[cypress]]es and [[larch]]es grow, as do varieties of subtropical flora such as [[magnolia]], [[azalea]] and [[acacia]]s. Numerous species of endemic flora in the Prealpine area include some species of [[saxifrage]], [[Allium insubricum|Lombardy garlic]],<ref name = RHSPF>{{cite web | url= https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/Search-Results?form-mode=false&query=allium%20insubricum
| title = RHS Plantfinder - ''Allium insubricum''
| publisher=Royal Horticultural Society | date=1993 | access-date=5 January 2018}}</ref> [[groundsel]] and [[campanula isophylla|bellflowers]].

The highlands are characterised by the typical vegetation of the [[Italian Alps]]. At and below about {{cvt|1100|m|ft}}, oaks or broadleaf trees grow; on the mountain slopes between {{cvt|2000|and|2100|m|ft}}, beech trees grow at the lowest limits with conifer woods higher up. Shrubs such as [[rhododendron]], dwarf pine and [[juniper]] are native to the summit zone beyond {{cvt|2200|m|ft}}.

Lombardy includes many protected areas. The most important is [[Stelvio National Park]], established in 1935<ref>Law no. 740 on the Constitution of the Stelvio National Park, published in ''Gazzetta Ufficiale del Regno d'Italia'' on June 3, [[1935]]. For the history of this institution see F.

Lombardy has a wide array of climates due to variance in elevation, proximity to inland water basins, and large metropolitan areas. The climate is mainly [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] Cfa), especially in the plains, though with significant variations to the Köppen model, especially in the normally long, damp, and cold winters. There is high seasonal temperature variation; in Milan, the average temperature is {{cvt|2.5|°C}} in January and {{cvt|24|°C}} in July. The plains are often subject to fog during the coldest months.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Climate and average monthly weather in Lombardy, Italy |url=https://weather-and-climate.com:80/average-monthly-Rainfall-Temperature-Sunshine-region-lombardy-it,Italy |access-date=19 June 2022|website=World Weather & Climate Information}}</ref>

In the Alpine foothills with [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] Cfb), numerous lakes have a mitigating influence, allowing typically Mediterranean crops (olive, [[citrus fruit]]) to grow. In the hills and mountains, the climate is [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] Dfb). In the valleys, it is relatively mild while it can be severely cold with copious snowfalls above {{cvt|1500|m|ft}}.

Precipitation is more intense in the [[Prealpi Orobiche|Prealpine]] zone, up to {{cvt|1500|to|2000|mm|1}} annually, but is also abundant in the plains and alpine zones, with an average of {{cvt|600|to|850|mm|1}} annually.

===Geology===
[[File:Val Brembana - Laghi Gemelli.jpg|thumb|[[Val Brembana]]]]
[[File:Origgio, campi e boschi.JPG|thumb|[[Po Valley]] in [[Origgio]], in the [[Alto Milanese]]. In the background [[Mount Rosa]]]]

The geological structure of Lombardy derives from the [[orogeny]] of the [[Alps]] due to the collision between the [[African Plate|African]] and [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] plates which generated the Alpine chain from the [[Upper Cretaceous]] to the [[Miocene]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Cesare|last=Perotti|chapter=Assetto tettonico ed evoluzione strutturale delle Prealpi bresciane dalla fine dell'orogenesi varisica ad oggi|title=Atti del "Convegno Una nuova geologia per la Lombardia|location=Milan|year=2008|publisher=LED|isbn=978-8879164528|language=it}}</ref>

The [[Po Valley]], on the other hand, is of more recent origin; formed by the deposit of detrital material on the continental shelf, coming from the erosion caused by surface waters, which accompanied the lifting of the Alpine chain, which rose to the west and north of the plain, and of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennine]] chain to the south, which filled the marine gulf existing in the [[Pliocene]] created by the uplift of the two mountain chains.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michele|last=Adorni|title=Raccontare la terra. 14 itinerari geologici in Emilia-Romagna|publisher=Pendragon|year=2006|isbn=978-8883424984|language=it}}</ref>

===Pollution===
Lombardy is one of the most-air-polluted areas of Europe.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Air pollution exposure, cause-specific deaths and hospitalizations in a highly polluted Italian region|year=2016|doi=10.1016/j.envres.2016.03.003|last1=Carugno|first1=Michele|last2=Consonni|first2=Dario|last3=Randi|first3=Giorgia|last4=Catelan|first4=Dolores|last5=Grisotto|first5=Laura|last6=Bertazzi|first6=Pier Alberto|last7=Biggeri|first7=Annibale|last8=Baccini|first8=Michela|journal=Environmental Research|volume=147|pages=415–424|pmid=26969808|bibcode=2016ER....147..415C|s2cid=22664973 |doi-access=free|hdl=2434/504866|hdl-access=free}}</ref> Because of high levels of industrialisation and the lack of wind due to the region being enclosed between mountain ranges, air pollution remains a severe problem in Lombardy and northern Italy.

In March 2019, the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2019/05/Nitrogen_dioxide_over_northern_Italy|title=Nitrogen dioxide over northern Italy|access-date=28 January 2021}}</ref> published images taken from its satellites that show a large stain composed of [[nitrogen dioxide]] and fine particles above the Po Valley area. Lombardy is the geographic and economic centre of this area, with more than 10 million residents and the highest GRP per inhabitant of the country. Most of its major cities are located in the Po river  basin, which crosses the region. The stain analysed by ESA is the main reason Po Valley air pollution levels are so high. Milan also has high levels of [[ozone]] and [[nitrogen oxides]], which are mainly produced by cars diesel and petrol engines.

According to [[Chicago Energy Policy Institute]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aqli.epic.uchicago.edu/news/air-pollution-hotspots-in-europe/|title=Air pollution hotspots in Europe|access-date=29 January 2021}}</ref> which has recently developed the [[Air Quality Life Index]] (AQLI), Po Valley air pollution reduces life expectancy by about six months. Air pollution in the Po Valley is connected to livestock and factories. The use of [[NPK fertilizer]]s, made of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, along with manure emissions from intensive breeding and high levels of nitrogen dioxide released by diesel and petrol engines are all causes of pollution in the north of Italy. Lombardy also produces vast amounts of animal waste, a big contributor to pollution. Lombardy produces more than 40% of Italy's milk and over half of the Italian pig production is located in the Po Valley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2019-02-italy-polluted-po-valley-gasps.html|title=Italy's polluted Po Valley gasps for fresh air|access-date=31 January 2021}}</ref>

According to research published in [[The Lancet Planetary Health]],<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Premature mortality due to air pollution in European cities: a health impact assessment|year=2021 |pmid=33482109 |last1=Khomenko |first1=S. |last2=Cirach |first2=M. |last3=Pereira-Barboza |first3=E. |last4=Mueller |first4=N. |last5=Barrera-Gómez |first5=J. |last6=Rojas-Rueda |first6=D. |last7=De Hoogh |first7=K. |last8=Hoek |first8=G. |last9=Nieuwenhuijsen |first9=M. |journal=The Lancet.

The data show many cities in Lombardy and the Po Valley suffer the most serious impact of poor air quality in Europe, primarily the metropolitan area of Milan, which is 13th in terms of fine particulate impact, with an annual premature death rate of 3,967 – approximately 9% of the total.

From archaeological findings of ceramics, arrows, axes, and carved stones, the area of current-day Lombardy has been settled at least since the second millennium BC. Well-preserved [[Rock Drawings in Valcamonica|rock drawings]] left by ancient [[Camuni]] in the [[Valcamonica]] depicting animals, people, and symbols were made over 8,000 years before the [[Iron Age]],<ref name="adorno">{{cite book|last= Adorno|first= Piero|title=L'arte italiana|year= 1992|publisher= D'Anna|location= Firenze|volume=1|chapter=Mesolitico e Neolitico|page=16|language=it}} {{No ISBN}}</ref> based on about 300,000 records.<ref name=archeointro>{{cite web|url=http://www.archeocamuni.it/arte_rupestre.html|title=Introduzione all'arte rupestre della Valcamonica |website=Archeocamuni.it|access-date=11 May 2009|language=it}}</ref>

The many artefacts found in a [[necropolis]] near [[Lake Maggiore]] and the [[Ticino (river)|Ticino]] demonstrate the presence of the [[Golasecca]] [[Bronze Age]] culture that prospered in western Lombardy between the ninth and the 4th centuries BC. In the following centuries, Lombardy was inhabited by different peoples; the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] founded the city of [[Mantua]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Fagles|first=Robert|title=The Aeneid|year=2006|publisher=Penguin Group|isbn=0-670-03803-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Lucchini|first=Daniele|title=Rise and fall of a capital. The history of Mantua in the words of who wrote about it|year=2013|publisher=Finisterrae|isbn=978-1-291-78388-9}}</ref> and spread the use of writing. It was seat of the Celtic [[Canegrate culture]] starting from the 13th century BC, and later of the Celtic [[Golasecca culture]]. From the 5th century BC, the area was invaded by more [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Gauls|Gallic]] tribes coming from north of the Alps. These people settled in several cities including Milan and extended their rule to the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Celtic development was halted by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] expansion in the Po Valley from the 3d century BC. After centuries of struggle, at the end of the 2nd century B.C.,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.capiate.org/SitoEN/comata.htm|title=The Gallia Comata |access-date=31 January 2024|language=it}}</ref> the entirety of modern-day Lombardy became a Roman province called [[Gallia Cisalpina]]—"[[Gaul]] on the inner side (with respect to Rome) of the [[Alps]]".

The Roman culture and language overwhelmed the former civilisation in the following years, and Lombardy became one of the most-developed and richest areas of Italy with the construction of roads and the development of agriculture and trade. Important figures were born here, such as Pliny the Elder (in [[Como]]) and Virgil (in Mantua). In [[late antiquity]] the strategic role of Lombardy was emphasised by the move of the capital of the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]] to [[Mediolanum]] (Milan). Here, in 313 AD, Roman Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] issued the famous ''[[Edict of Milan]]'' that gave freedom of confession to all religions within the Roman Empire.

===Kingdom of the Lombards===
{{Further|Lombards|Kingdom of the Lombards}}

[[File:Iron Crown.JPG|thumbnail|For centuries, the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] was used in the [[Coronation]] of the [[King of Italy]].]]

During and after the fall of the Western Empire, Lombardy heavily suffered from destruction brought about by a series of invasions by tribal peoples. After 540, [[Pavia]] became the permanent capital of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]], the fixed site of the court and the royal treasury.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.monasteriimperialipavia.it/pavia-citta-regia/?lang=en|title=Pavia Royal town|work=Monasteri Imperiali Pavia|access-date=29 July 2022|language=it}}</ref> The last and most effective invasion was that of the Germanic [[Lombards]] or Longobards, whose nation migrated to the region from the [[Carpathian basin]] in fear of the conquering [[Pannonian Avars]] in 568. The Lombards' long-lasting reign, with its capital in [[Pavia]], gave the current name to the region. There was a close relationship between the [[Franks|Frankish]], [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavarian]] and Lombard nobility for many centuries.

After the initial struggles, relationships between the Lombard people and the [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman peoples]]<ref>[[#Pellegrini|Pellegrini]]: "L'Italia settentrionale nei secoli del tardo impero ed in quelli successivi sino al 1000 (forse anche dopo) risulta strettamente collegata con la Gallia sul piano politico e linguistico; si può parlare senza tema di errore di un'ampia 'Galloromania' che include non soltanto la Rezia ma anche la Cisalpina con buona parte del Veneto." [Northern Italy in the centuries of the Late Empire and in the following ones up to 1000 (maybe even later) is closely connected with Gaul on a political and linguistic level; one can speak without fear of error of a broad 'Galloromania' which includes not only Rhaetia but also the Cisalpine with a good part of Veneto.]</ref> improved. The Lombard language and culture was integrated with the Latin culture, leaving evidence in many names, the legal code and laws. The Lombards became intermixed with the [[Roman people|Roman population]] owing to their relatively smaller number.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eupedia.com/genetics/italian_dna.shtml |title=Genetic History of the Italians |work=Eupedia |author =Maciamo Hay|date=July 2013 |access-date=22 January 2019}}</ref> The end of Lombard rule came in 774, when the Frankish king [[Charlemagne]] [[Siege of Pavia (773–774)|conquered Pavia]], deposed [[Desiderius]] the last Lombard king, and annexed the [[The Kingdom of the Lombards|Kingdom of Italy]]—mostly northern and central present-day Italy—to his newly established [[Holy Roman Empire]]. [[Charlemagne]] was crowned by the Pope on 25 December 800. The former Lombard dukes and nobles were replaced by other German vassals, prince-bishops and marquises. The entire northern part of the Italian peninsula continued to be called "Lombardy" and its population "Lombards" throughout the following centuries.

===Communes and the Empire===
[[File:San michele maggiore.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[San Michele Maggiore, Pavia]], where almost all the [[King of Italy|kings of Italy]] were crowned up to [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]]]]

In the 10th century, Lombardy, although formally under the rule of the Holy Roman Empire, was included in the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|kingdom of Italy]], of which [[Pavia]] remained the capital until 1024.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/regno-italico_(Enciclopedia-Italiana)|title=ITALICO, REGNO in "Enciclopedia Italiana"|language=it|access-date=14 February 2023}}</ref> Starting gradually in the late-11th century, Lombardy became divided into many small, autonomous city-states, the [[medieval communes]]. Also in the 11th century, the region's economy underwent a significant boom due to improved trading, sartorial manufacturing of silk and wool, and agricultural conditions; arms manufacturing for the purpose of defensive army development, by the German imperial divisions of ''Guelphs'' (''Welfen'') defending the Pope and ''Ghibellins'' (''Wibellingen'') defending the Emperor, became a significant factor. As in other areas of Italy, this led to a growing self-acknowledgement of the cities, whose increasing wealth made them able to defy the traditional feudal supreme power that was represented by the German emperors and their local legates. 
[[File:Member Cities of the Lombard Leagues.png|thumbnail|Member cities of the first and second [[Lombard League]]]]

This process peaked in the 12th and 13th centuries, when [[Lombard League]]s formed by allied cities of Lombardy, usually led by Milan, defeated the [[Hohenstaufen]] Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa|Frederick I]], at [[Battle of Legnano|Legnano]] but not his grandson [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] at [[Battle of Cortenuova]]. Although having the military purpose as preponderant, the Lombard League also had its own stable government, considered one of the first examples of [[confederation]] in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/lega-lombarda_(Federiciana)/|title=Lega Lombarda|publisher=[[Treccani]]|access-date=31 August 2023|language=it}}</ref> Subsequently, among the local city-states, a process of consolidation took place, and by the end of the 14th century, two ''[[signoria]]'' emerged as rival [[hegemon]]s in Lombardy; [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]] and [[Duchy of Mantua|Mantua]].

===Renaissance duchies of Milan and Mantua===
{{Further|Duchy of Milan|Duchy of Mantua}}
[[File:Visconti XIV century.svg|thumb|The [[Visconti of Milan|Viscontis']] dominions in the 14th century, before the foundation of the [[Duchy of Milan]]]]

In the 15th century, the [[Duchy of Milan]] was one of the wealthiest states during the [[Renaissance]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Milan – History|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Milan-Italy|access-date=17 December 2020|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> Milan and Mantua became centres of the [[Renaissance]], whose culture with people such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Andrea Mantegna]], and works of art such as da Vinci's ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' were highly regarded. The enterprising class of the communes extended its trade and banking activities well into northern Europe; the metonym "Lombard" designated a merchant or banker from northern Italy, for example [[Lombard Street, London]]. 

The name "Lombardy" came to denote the whole of northern Italy until the 15th century and sometimes later.<ref>{{cite book|first=Leandro|last=Alberti|title=Descrittione di tutta Italia di F. Leandro Alberti bolognese, nella quale si contiene il sito di essa, l'origine & le signorie delle città & de i castelli...|publisher=Giouan Maria Bonelli|location=Venice|year=1553|language=it}} {{No ISBN}}</ref> From the 14th century onward, the instability created by the internal and external struggles ended in the creation of noble ''seigniories'', the most significant of whom were the [[Visconti of Milan|Viscontis]] (later [[House of Sforza|Sforzas]]) in Milan and of the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzagas]] in Mantua. This wealth, however, attracted the now-more-organised armies of national powers such as France and Austria, which waged a lengthy battle for Lombardy in the late 15th to early 16th centuries.

===Late-Middle Ages, Renaissance and Enlightenment===

After the [[Battle of Pavia]], the Duchy of Milan became a possession of the [[Habsburgs]] of Spain; the new rulers did little to improve the economy of Lombardy, instead imposing a growing series of taxes to support their lengthy series of European wars. The eastern part of modern-day Lombardy, including the cities [[Bergamo]] and [[Brescia]], was controlled by the [[Republic of Venice]], which had begun to extend its influence in the area from the 14th century onwards. Between the mid-15th century and the [[battle of Marignano]] in 1515, the northern part of east Lombardy from [[Airolo]] to [[Chiasso]] (modern [[Ticino]]), and the [[Valtellina]] valley came under possession of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]].

[[1629–1631 Italian plague|Pestilence]]s like that of 1628–1630,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.storiadimilano.it/Personaggi/Milanesi%20illustri/mora.htm|title=Storia di Milano - Gian Giacomo Mora|website=Storiadimilano.it|access-date=6 February 2024|language=it}}</ref> which [[Alessandro Manzoni]] described in his ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|I Promessi Sposi]]'', and the general decline of Italy's economy in the 17th and 18th centuries halted further development of Lombardy. In 1706 the [[Austrian Empire]] came to power, and introduced some economic and social measures that allowed a degree of recovery to occur.

Austrian rule was interrupted in the late-18th century by the French; under [[Napoleon]], Lombardy became the centre of the [[Cisalpine Republic]] and of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], both of which were [[puppet state]]s of France's [[First French Empire|First Empire]], with Milan as capital and Napoleon as head of state. During this period, Lombardy regained Valtellina from Switzerland.

===Modern era===
{{Further|Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia|Unification of Italy}}
[[File:5giornatemilano.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Five Days of Milan]], 1848]]

The restoration of Austrian rule in 1815 as the [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia]] was characterised by a struggle with the new ideals introduced by the Napoleonic era. Lombardy was then an important centre of the ''[[Risorgimento]]'', with the [[Five Days of Milan]] in March 1848, the [[Ten Days of Brescia]] in 1849, the [[Belfiore martyrs]] in Mantua in the years between 1851 and 1853. The annexation of Lombardy to the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] occurred following the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] in 1859, a war during which Lombardy was the main theatre of battle (battles of [[Battle of Montebello (1859)|Montebello]], [[Battle of Palestro|Palestro]], [[Battle of Magenta|Magenta]], [[Battle of Solferino|Solferino]] and [[Battle of San Fermo|San Fermo]]). 

In 1861, with the [[proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy]], Lombardy became part of the modern Italian state, except for the central-eastern part of the [[province of Mantua]] which was [[Plebiscite of Veneto of 1866|annexed in 1866]] after the [[Third Italian War of Independence]].<ref>Royal Decree 4 November 1866 no. 3300 and Law 18 July 1867 no. 3841</ref> Regarding the battle of Solferino, it was during this conflict that [[Henry Dunant]] took the initiative to create the [[Red Cross]]. After the annexation of Mantua, Lombardy achieved its present-day territorial shape by adding the [[Oltrepò Pavese]], formerly the southern part of the [[Province of Novara]], to the [[Province of Pavia]].

===Contemporary era===

The Alpine front of [[World War I]] crossed the eastern Lombardy Alpine side, and in the post-war period Milan was the centre of the [[Fasci Italiani di Combattimento|Italian Fasces of Combat]]. Milan then became the [[Gold Medal of Military Valor]] for the [[Italian resistance movement]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fondazionefeltrinelli.it/scopri/una-medaglia-una-lapide-e-quattro-atti-di-eroismo-per-la-memoria-pubblica-di-milano/|title=Una medaglia, una lapide e quattro atti di eroismo per la memoria pubblica di Milano|access-date=1 February 2024|language=it}}</ref> during the [[Italian Civil War]] after its liberation from fascism during the [[World War II]], while the partisan resistance spread across the valleys and provinces.

Following the historical borders, in 1948 the administrative region of Lombardy was prefigured as part of the newly formed [[Italian Republic]]. In the years of the [[Italian economic miracle]], Milan was one of the poles of the "industrial triangle" of northern Italy formed by the cities of [[Turin]]-[[Milan]]-[[Genoa]]. The [[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of Lead]] had wide relevance in Lombardy, with the [[Piazza Fontana bombing]] in Milan in 1969 and the [[Piazza della Loggia bombing]] in [[Brescia]] in 1974.

The region can be broadly divided into three economic areas: Milan, where the services sector comprises 65.3% of employment; the provinces of [[Varese]], Como, [[Lecco]], [[Province of Monza and Brianza|Monza and Brianza]], Bergamo and Brescia, the latter having the highest value added in industry in Europe,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brescia, the Capital of the European Industry|url=https://www.fierabie.com/brescia-the-capital-of-the-european-industry/|access-date=6 February 2024}}</ref> where there is a highly industrialised economy and a rich agricultural sector; and the provinces of [[Province of Sondrio|Sondrio]], [[Province of Pavia|Pavia]], [[Province of Cremona|Cremona]], [[Province of Mantua|Mantova]] and [[Province of Lodi|Lodi]], where there is consistent agricultural activity and an above-average development of the services sector.

In the tertiary sector, the weight of trade and finance is significant.

[[File:Colline moreniche del Lago Garda.JPG|thumbnail|Cultivated fields in [[Upper Mantua]]]]

The productivity of agriculture is enhanced by the use of fertilisers and the traditional abundance of water, which has been boosted since the Middle Ages by the construction of irrigation systems that were partly designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Lower plains are used for fodder crops, cereals (rice, wheat and maize) and sugar beet. Lombardy is one of the main European regions for rice production and together with Piedmont, produces 93% of Italian rice. Cultivation is concentrated in the provinces of Pavia ({{cvt|84000|ha|acre}}, Milan ({{cvt|14000|ha|acre}}), Lodi {{cvt|2000|ha|acre}} and Mantua ({{cvt|1200|ha|acre}}).<ref name="Riso italiano, dove si coltiva">{{cite web |url=https://www.ricetteracconti.com/2020/11/14/riso-italiano-dove-si-coltiva/|title=Riso italiano, dove si coltiva|work=Ricette e racconti di riso|date=14 November 2020 |access-date=17 August 2022|language=it}}</ref> Produce of the higher plains includes cereals, vegetables, fruit trees and mulberries. Fruits and wine are produced in upland areas such as the [[Prealpi Orobiche|Prealps]] and [[Alps]] sectors in the north.

One-sixth of the Italian population, about 10 million people, live in Lombardy (16.2% of the national population; 2% of the [[European Union]] population). Lombardy is the second most populous [[Region (Europe)|region in the European Union]] (EU).<ref name="pop"/>

The population is highly concentrated in the Milan metropolitan area (2,029 inh./km<sup>2</sup>) and the Alpine foothills that compose the southern section of the provinces [[Province of Varese|Varese]], [[Province of Como|Como]], [[Province of Lecco|Lecco]], [[Province of Monza and Brianza|Monza and Brianza]] and [[Province of Bergamo|Bergamo]], (1,200 inh./km<sup>2</sup>). A lower average population density (250 inh./km<sup>2</sup>) is found in the [[Padan Plain|Po Valley]] and the lower Brescia valleys; much lower densities (fewer than 60 inh./km<sup>2</sup>) inhabit the northern mountain areas and the southern [[Oltrepò Pavese]] subregion.<ref name="Regional Statistical Yearbook 2014">{{cite web|title=Regional Statistical Yearbook 2014|url=http://www.asr-lombardia.it/ASR/pubblicazioni-scaricabili/p10_Volume_ASR_2014.pdf|publisher=Regione Lombardia|access-date=21 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923175443/http://www.asr-lombardia.it/ASR/pubblicazioni-scaricabili/p10_Volume_ASR_2014.pdf|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The growth of the regional population was particularly sustained during the 1950s–1960s, due to a prolonged economic boom, high birth rates and strong migration inflows—especially from southern Italy. Since the 1980s, Lombardy has become the destination of a large number of international migrants. {{As of|2021}}, the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) estimated that 1,190,889 foreign-born people live in Lombardy, equal to 11.9% of the total population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tuttitalia.it/lombardia/statistiche/cittadini-stranieri-2021/|title=Cittadini stranieri 2021 - Lombardia|access-date=1 February 2024|language=it}}</ref>

The primary religion is [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. Over the centuries, the Catholic [[diocese]]s of Lombardy have given birth to ten [[pope]]s: [[Pope John XIV]], [[Pope Alexander II]], [[Pope Urban III]], [[Pope Celestine IV]], [[Pope Pius IV]], [[Pope Gregory XIV]], [[Pope Innocent XI]], [[Pope Pius XI]], [[Pope John XXIII]] and [[Pope Paul VI]]. 

The structure of the Lombard Catholic dioceses is historical. Of the ten dioceses, eight date back to the [[Roman Empire]], only [[Crema, Lombardy|Crema]] and [[Vigevano]] were created in the 16th century to reflect political needs,{{efn|[[Crema, Lombardy|Crema]] belonged to the part of the territory of [[Cremona]] conquered for more than a century by the [[Republic of Venice]], whereas [[Vigevano]] reunified an area formerly from [[Novara]] which over the centuries had been fragmented due to the powerful influence of nearby [[Pavia]].}} and it does not appear that any diocesan seat was ever suppressed. The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lugano|diocese of Lugano]] was created in the 19th century to separate the Swiss parishes which since ancient times had been dependent on the dioceses of [[Como]] and [[Milan]].

In Lombardy there are two main Catholic liturgical rites: the [[Ambrosian Rite]] (used in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|Milanese archdiocese]], but also used in the parishes of [[Val Taleggio]] in the [[province of Bergamo]]) and the [[Roman Rite]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chiesadimilano.it/chisiamo/la-scheda/2.675/rito-ambrosiano-la-centralit%C3%A0-dell-opera-br-di-sant-ambrogio-per-la-chiesa-di-milano-1.589|title=Rito ambrosiano in Lombardia|access-date=1 August 2012|language=it}}</ref> The Milanese diocese, comprising approximately half of the faithful of the region, is the [[Ecclesiastical province|metropolitan see]], while the others are its [[Suffragan diocese|suffragans]].

Significant religious minorities in Lombardy include [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]], [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox Christians]], as well as [[Jews]], [[Buddhist]]s, [[Sikh]]s and [[Islam|Muslims]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lastatalenews.unimi.it/immigrazione-pluralismo-religioso|title=Immigrazione e pluralismo religioso|date=October 2023 |access-date=1 February 2024|language=it}}</ref>

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Lombardy}}

===Government===
[[File:Piazza Gae Aulenti with Palazzo Lombardia cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Palazzo Lombardia]] in [[Milan]], headquarters of the regional government of Lombardy]]

Lombardy has a system of [[representative democracy]] in which the President of the Region (''{{lang|it|Presidente della Regione}}'') is the [[head of government]] and of a pluriform [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is vested in the regional government (''{{lang|it|Giunta Regionale}}'') and [[legislative power]] is vested in the [[Regional Council of Lombardy|Regional Council]] (''{{lang|it|Consiglio Regionale}}'').

Like the other regions of Italy with ordinary statutes, the region has been provided for since 1948 by articles 114 and 115 of the [[Constitution of Italy]], but only with law no. 281 of 16 May 1970 having as its object "Financial measures for the implementation of the Regions with ordinary statute", with which the process of administrative decentralization envisaged by article 5 and article 118 of the Constitution was started, implemented its functions.

The Council is elected for a five-year term, but, if the President suffers a vote of no confidence, resigns or dies, under the ''simul stabunt, simul cadent'' clause introduced in 1999 (literally ''they will stand together or they will fall together''), also the Council is dissolved and a snap election is called.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.consiglio.regione.lombardia.it/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=PRI.1046.1&p_p_id=20&p_p_action=1&p_p_state=exclusive&p_p_col_id=null&p_p_col_pos=2&p_p_col_count=3&_20_struts_action=%2Fdocument_library%2Fget_file&_20_folderId=69&_20_name=l+cost+199_PDF.pdf |title=Regional Council of Lombardy – 1999 Constitutional Law |access-date=6 March 2009|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090306051303/http://www.consiglio.regione.lombardia.it/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=PRI.1046.1&p_p_id=20&p_p_action=1&p_p_state=exclusive&p_p_col_id=null&p_p_col_pos=2&p_p_col_count=3&_20_struts_action=/document_library/get_file&_20_folderId=69&_20_name=l+cost+199_PDF.pdf |archive-date=6 March 2009|url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.consiglio.regione.lombardia.it/web/crl/AttivitaConsiliari/LavoriCommissioni/CommissioneStatuto/documenti |title=Concisglio regionale della Lombardia – Stututo dell'autonomia |access-date=9 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726092050/http://www.consiglio.regione.lombardia.it/web/crl/AttivitaConsiliari/LavoriCommissioni/CommissioneStatuto/documenti |archive-date=26 July 2011 |url-status=dead|language=it}}</ref> The Regional Cabinet (''Giunta Regionale'') is presided by the President of the Region (''Presidente della Regione''), who is elected for a five-year term, and is currently composed by 17 members: the President and 16 regional [[Assessor (Italy)|Assessors]], including a Vice President (''Vice Presidente''), while 4 under-secretaries (''Sottosegretari'') help the President but have no voting rights in the cabinet meetings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regione.lombardia.it/wps/portal/_s.155/606/.cmd/ad/.ar/sa.link/.c/502/.ce/628/.p/408?PC_408_linkQuery=pagename=PortaleLombardia%2FGenDoc%2FPL_GenDoc_light,c=GenDoc,cid=1043797879469,dir_gen=off,fronte=off,ottica=off#628|title=Lombardy Region – Regional Cabinet|access-date=6 February 2024}}</ref>

===Politics===
[[File:Piazza Lombardia della Regione Lombardia 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Internal view of Palazzo Lombardia]]

From 1945 to the early 1990s, the moderate [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]] maintained a large majority of the popular support and control of the most important cities and provinces from the end of the Second World War. The opposition [[Italian Communist Party]] was a considerable presence only in southern Lombardy and in the working-class districts of Milan; their base, however, was increasingly eroded by the rival centrist [[Italian Socialist Party]] until the ''[[Mani Pulite]]'' corruption scandal, which spread from Milan to the whole of Italy, almost completely erased the old political class.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ilpost.it/2022/02/18/tangentopoli-cause-conseguenze/|title=Tangentopoli trent'anni dopo|date=18 February 2022 |access-date=1 February 2024|language=it}}</ref>

This, together with general disaffection for the central government, led to the sudden growth of the secessionist [[Lega Nord|Northern League]]. Since 2002, Lombardy has remained strongly conservative in six general elections. The regional capital Milan elected progressive [[Giuliano Pisapia]] at the 2011 municipal elections and the 2013 regional elections saw a narrow victory for the centre-right coalition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.consiglio.regione.lombardia.it/wps/wcm/connect/4e4f04c2-cfe9-4ecf-87ce-039887cbb399/dossier_elezioni_regionali_2013_Lombardia.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE-4e4f04c2-cfe9-4ecf-87ce-039887cbb399-mwJYt2I|title=Elezioni regionali del 24 e 25 febbraio 2013|page=5|access-date=1 February 2024|language=it}}</ref>

On 22 October 2017, a non-binding [[Lombard autonomy referendum, 2017|autonomy referendum]] took place in Lombardy. The turnout was 38.3%, of which 95.3% voted in favour.

===Administrative divisions===
Lombardy is divided into 1,502 ''[[comuni]]'' (the region with the largest number of ''comuni'' in the entire national territory<ref name="comuni"/>), distributed in twelve administrative subdivisions (eleven [[Provinces of Italy|provinces]] plus the [[Metropolitan City of Milan]]). The largest province is that of [[Province of Brescia|Brescia]], the smallest that of [[Province of Monza and Brianza|Monza and Brianza]]. The [[exclave]] of [[Campione d'Italia]] also belongs to the region, a ''comune'' entirely surrounded by [[Switzerland|Swiss territory]] and part of the [[province of Como]].

===Symbols===
[[File:Flag of Lombardy.svg|thumb|The [[flag of Lombardy]]]]
[[File:Rosa camuna R24 - Foppe - Nadro (Foto Luca Giarelli).jpg|thumb|One of the [[Camunian rose]]s depicted in the [[Rock Drawings in Valcamonica]], in the [[province of Brescia]]]]

The symbols of Lombardy are, pursuant to the region's statute of autonomy, the flag, the coat of arms, the banner and the celebration of 29 May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://normelombardia.consiglio.regione.lombardia.it/normelombardia/Accessibile/main.aspx?iddoc=lrst2008051400001&view=showdoc|title=Legge Regionale Statutaria nº1 del 30 agosto 2008 - Statuto d'autonomia della Lombardia|access-date=27 November 2017|language=it}}</ref>

The official coat of arms of Lombardy consists of a [[Camunian rose]], an ancient solar symbol common to some proto-[[Celt]]ic peoples, present in 94 of the approximately 140,000 [[Rock Drawings in Valcamonica]], in the [[province of Brescia]]. These engravings were made from the [[Mesolithic]] (approximately 8th-6th millennium BC) to the [[Iron Age]] (1st millennium BC) by various ancient peoples, including the [[Camunni]].

[[Lombard cuisine]] is the style of cooking in the [[Northern Italy|Northern Italian]] region of Lombardy. The historical events of its provinces and the diversity of its territories resulted in a varied culinary tradition. First courses in Lombard cuisine range from [[risotto]]s to [[soup]]s and [[Filled pasta|stuffed pasta]] (in [[broth]] or not), and a large choice of second-course meat or fish dishes, due to the many lakes and rivers of Lombardy.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Daniela Guaiti|title=Lombardia|series=La grande cucina regionale italiana|publisher=Gribaudo|year=2010|location=Verona|page=10|language=it|isbn=978-8879068383}}</ref>

The cuisine of the various Lombardy provinces can be united by the following traits: prevalence of [[rice]] and stuffed pasta over dry pasta, both [[butter]] and [[olive oil]] for cooking, dishes cooked for a long time, as well as the widespread use of [[pork]], [[milk]] and [[Dairy product|dairy products]], and [[egg]]-based preparations; to which is added the consumption of [[polenta]], common to the whole [[Northern Italy]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Per un codice della cucina lombarda|url=http://www.buonalombardia.regione.lombardia.it/shared/ccurl/433/68/Nuovo%20Codice%20Cucina%20Lombarda.pdf|publisher=Regione Lombardia|page=1|language=it|access-date=6 February 2024|archive-date=5 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201005143956/https://www.buonalombardia.regione.lombardia.it/shared/ccurl/433/68/Nuovo%20Codice%20Cucina%20Lombarda.pdf/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Rice is popular in Lombardy; the region is the largest in Europe for rice production and in particular the province of Pavia, where over {{Cvt|84000|ha}} are cultivated.<ref name="Riso italiano, dove si coltiva"/> Rice is often used in soups and ''[[Risotto|risotti]]'', such as "risotto alla milanese", with [[saffron]]. In Monza, a popular recipe adds pieces of sausages to the risotto, while in Pavia they eat Carthusian risotto, according to the legend created by the monks of the [[Certosa di Pavia|Certosa]], which is based on crayfish, carrots and onions. They also eat risotto with eye beans, a version with sausage and [[Bonarda Piemontese|bonarda]], and risotto with [[Humulus lupulus|common hops]] (ürtis in Pavese dialect). [[Polenta]] is common throughout the region.

Regional cheeses include ''[[Robiola]]'', ''[[Crescenza]]'', ''[[Taleggio (cheese)|Taleggio]]'', ''[[Gorgonzola (cheese)|Gorgonzola]]'' and ''[[Grana Padano]]''. Butter and cream are used. Single-pot dishes, which take little work to prepare, are popular. Common types of pasta include [[Casoncelli]] in Brescia and Bergamo and [[Pizzoccheri]] in Valtellina. In Mantua, festivals feature ''tortelli di zucca'' ([[ravioli]] with pumpkin filling) accompanied by melted butter and followed by [[turkey meat|turkey]] stuffed with chicken or other stewed meats.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Claudia|last1=Piras|first2=Eugenio|last2=Medagliani| title=Culinaria Italy| publisher=Könemann Verlagsgesellschaft mbh| year=2000|isbn=3-8290-2901-2|page=87}}</ref> Among typical regional desserts is [[Canzo#Cuisine|Nocciolini di Canzo]]—dry biscuits. Common in the whole [[Insubria]] area are ''[[bruscitti]]'', originating from [[Alto Milanese|Altomilanese]], which consist of a braised meat dish cut very thin and cooked in wine and [[Fennel|fennel seeds]], historically obtained by stripping leftover meat.

It is spoken in the Italian region of Lombardy, in the Novara province of Piedmont, and in Switzerland. Mutual intelligibility between speakers of Lombard and monolingual Italian speakers has been reported as very low (Tamburelli 2014). Although some Lombard varieties, Milanese in particular, enjoy a rather long and prestigious literary tradition, Lombard is now mostly used in informal domains.  According to Ethnologue, Piedmontese and Lombard are spoken by between 1,600,000 and 2,000,000 speakers and around 3,500,000 speakers, respectively.

The Celtic [[linguistic substratum]] of modern Lombard and the neighbouring languages of Northern Italy is self-evident and so the Lombard language is classified as a [[Gallo-Italic languages|Gallo-Italic language]] (from the ancient Roman name for the Celts, [[Gauls]]).<ref name="auto2">{{cite book |last=Agnoletto |first=Attilio |title=San Giorgio su Legnano - storia, società, ambiente |year=1992 |id=[[Servizio bibliotecario nazionale|SBN]]&nbsp;[http://opac.sbn.it/bid/CFI0249761 IT\ICCU\CFI\0249761]|page=120|language=it}}</ref> [[Roman Empire|Roman domination]] shaped the dialects spoken in the area, which was called [[Cisalpine Gaul]] by the Romans, and much of the [[lexicon]] and [[grammar]] of the Lombard language have their origin in [[Latin]].<ref>{{cite book |last=D'Ilario |first=Giorgio |title=Dizionario legnanese |publisher=Artigianservice |year=2003 |id=[[Servizio bibliotecario nazionale|SBN]]&nbsp;[http://opac.sbn.it/bid/MIL0625963 IT\ICCU\MIL\0625963]|page=29|language=it}}</ref> However, that influence was not homogeneous<ref name="auto2"/> since idioms of different areas were influenced by previous linguistic substrata, and each area was marked by a stronger or weaker Latinisation or the preservation of ancient Celtic characteristics.<ref name="auto2"/>

The main varieties of the Lombard language are [[Western Lombard]] (spoken in the provinces of [[Province of Varese|Varese]], [[Province of Como|Como]], [[Province of Lecco|Lecco]], [[Province of Sondrio|Sondrio]], [[Province of Monza and Brianza|Monza and Brianza]], [[Metropolitan City of Milan|Milan]], [[Province of Lodi|Lodi]] and [[Province of Pavia|Pavia]]), [[Eastern Lombard]] (in the provinces of [[Province of Bergamo|Bergamo]] and [[Province of Brescia|Brescia]], in [[Crema, Italy|Cremasco]], in [[Upper Mantua]] and in the [[Province of Lecco|Lecco]] municipalities of Val San Martino), the Alpine Lombard (in [[Ticino]] and in [[Italian Grisons]], in the north of Lombardy and [[Piedmont]] and in some areas of [[Trentino]]) and the Southern Lombard, in transition with the [[Emilian language]] (in the provinces of [[Province of Cremona|Cremona]] and [[Province of Mantua|Mantua]]); in the southern part of the [[province of Mantua]] and in Casalasco (south-eastern area of the [[province of Cremona]]) Emilian language is spoken.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archive.org/stream/saggiosuidialet02biongoog#page/n8/mode/1up|title=Saggi sui dialetti Gallo-Italici|access-date=1 July 2012|language=it}}</ref>

The Lombard language should not be confused with that of the [[Lombards]] – [[Lombardic language]], a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]] extinct since the Middle Ages. Lombard is considered a [[minority language]] that is structurally separate from [[Italian language|Italian]] by both [[Ethnologue]] and the [[UNESCO]] ''Red Book on Endangered Languages''. However, [[Italy]] and [[Switzerland]] do not recognize Lombard speakers as a linguistic minority. Traditionally, the Lombard dialects have been classified into the Eastern, Western, Alpine and Southern Lombard dialects.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lingualombarda.it/index.php/lingua-lombarda-lato.html |title=Lingua lombarda |trans-title=Lombard language |publisher=Circolo Filologico Milanese |website=Lingua Lombarda|language=it|access-date=6 February 2024}}</ref>

==Culture==
===Art and architecture===
====From prehistory to the classical era====
[[File:4193 - Milano - Ruderi dell'Arena romana - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto 14-July.2007.jpg|thumb|The remains of the [[Milan amphitheatre]], which can be found inside the archaeological park of the Antiquarium in Milan]]
The first artistic evidence in Lombardy dates back to the [[Mesolithic]] period when, at the end of the [[Würm glaciation]], the historical cycle of the [[Rock Drawings in Valcamonica]] began, which continued and subsequently expanded in the [[Neolithic]] and the [[Copper Age]] to end only in Roman and medieval times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archeocamuni.it/ciclo_camuno.html|title=Il ciclo istoriativo camuno: una tradizione millenaria|access-date=1 August 2012|language=it}}</ref> The Camunian cycle is considered one of the most important testimonies of prehistory worldwide<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/94|title=Rock Drawings in Valcamonica|access-date=1 August 2012|language=it}}</ref> and is therefore included in the list of [[World Heritage Site]].

Furthermore, further finds have been found of the presence of prehistoric populations in the Lombardy territory, also included in the world heritage of humanity with the serial site of the "[[Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps]]", with several locations located in Lombardy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/fr/list/1363|title=Sites palafittiques préhistoriques autour des Alpes|access-date=1 August 2012|language=fr}}</ref>

The [[Celts]] left evidence scattered throughout the archaeological museums of the region, while the [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] presence is attested in the [[Mantua]] area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parcoarcheologicoforcello.it|title=Parco Archeologico Forcello|access-date=1 August 2012|language=it}}</ref> Following the [[Roman expansion in Italy|Roman conquest]], the artistic evolution of the region veered towards the styles of the conquerors from the late republican period to the Roman imperial era: monumental remains of this historical era can be seen in [[Brescia]] ({{langx|la|Brixia}}) and [[Milan]] ({{langx|la|[[Mediolanum]]}}).

====From late antiquity to the modern era====
[[File:Sacello di san vittore in ciel d'oro, mosaici del 450-500 dc ca. 01.jpg|thumb|left|Early Christian chapel located inside the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan]]

In the late ancient period, the Lombardy territory acquired importance, with Milan being the capital of the [[Western Roman Empire]], and consequently, the artistic production also increased, of which evidence remains especially in sacred architecture with the construction of [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] churches, [[Early Christian churches in Milan|particularly in Milan]].

The subsequent early medieval period, coeval with and following the [[Migration Period]], will be of capital importance for the development of regional art: the stylistic features of barbarian art introduced by the new populations in fact brought a decisive contribution, merging with late ancient models (which are maintained with continuity) as well as thanks to [[Byzantine art|Byzantine influences]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Marco|last=Rossi|title=Disegno storico dell'arte lombarda|publisher=Vita e Pensiero|isbn=978-88-343-1212-4|year=2005|pages=11–12|language=it}}</ref> for the creation of a truly Lombard art. In fact, upon leaving the early medieval period, we began to talk about artistic styles specific to Lombardy such as the [[First Romanesque|Lombard Romanesque]].
[[File:Lombardia Como1 tango7174.jpg|thumb|[[Basilica of Sant'Abbondio]] in [[Como]]]]

Noteworthy examples of the Lombard Romanesque style are the work of the [[Comacine masters]], in particular in the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] and [[San Michele Maggiore, Pavia|Basilica of San Michele Maggiore]] and in the [[Basilica of Sant'Abbondio]], in the Como area. The most important contribution between the 6th and 8th centuries came from the [[Lombards]] who, occupying a large part of Italy, established their capital in [[Pavia]] and made Lombardy the fulcrum of their kingdom bringing their art with them, of which there remain both significant testimonies (in particular in [[Brescia]], [[Monza]], Pavia and [[Castelseprio, Lombardy|Castelseprio]]) and a substantial influence on subsequent artistic developments.

In the Lombard area, the [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] period saw substantial artistic continuity with the previous Lombard period. The lower production of monumental buildings typical of these centuries is counterbalanced by numerous minor artefacts of great value, such as the {{ill|Cross of Agilulf|it|Croce di Agilulfo}}, the [[Cross of Desiderius]] and the {{ill|Gospel Book of Theodelinda|it|Evangeliario di Teodolinda}}. Also in Lombardy are some of the greatest expressions of Lombard sculpture, such as the slab with peacock in the Museum of Santa Giulia in [[Brescia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.santagiulia.info/museo_di_santa_giulia/periodo_longobardo/index.htm|title=Il periodo longobardo al Museo di Santa Giulia|access-date=31 March 2013|language=it}}</ref> or the [[Plutei of Theodota]] in the [[Pavia Civic Museums]]. The following centuries, as already mentioned, were characterized by artistic styles typical of Lombardy such as the Lombard Romanesque, the [[Italian Gothic architecture|Lombard Gothic]], the [[Renaissance in Lombardy|Lombard Renaissance]] and the Lombard [[Seicento]]. Finally, we must not forget, especially during the Renaissance, the contributions and stimuli left in local art by some great Renaissance masters who worked in Milan at the [[House of Sforza|Sforza]] court, such as [[Filarete]], [[Donato Bramante]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and in Mantua at the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] court, like [[Andrea Mantegna]] and [[Giulio Romano (painter)|Giulio Romano]].

====Contemporary age====
[[File:Umberto Boccioni Forme uniche nella continuità dello spazio 1913.jpg|thumb|[[Umberto Boccioni]], ''[[Unique Forms of Continuity in Space]]'', example from 1949 exhibited at the [[Museo del Novecento]] in Milan|216x216px]]

In February 1910 the painters [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Giacomo Balla]], [[Gino Severini]] and [[Luigi Russolo]] signed the ''Manifesto dei pittori futuristi'' in Milan and in April of the same year the ''Manifesto tecnico della pittura futurista,'',<ref>{{cite book|first1=Maria|last1=Drudi Gambillo|first2=Teresa|last2=Fiori|title=Archivi del futurismo|publisher= Edizioni De Luca|year=1958|page=63|language=it}} {{No ISBN}}</ref> which they contributed, together with others posters signed in other Italian cities, to found the artistic movement of [[Futurism]]. Upon the death of Umberto Boccioni in 1916, Carrà and Severini found themselves in a phase of evolution towards [[Cubism|cubist]] painting, consequently, the Milanese group disbanded, moving the headquarters of the movement from Milan to Rome, with the consequent birth of the "second Futurism".

Lombardy was the birthplace of another important artistic movement of the 20th century, the [[Novecento Italiano|Novecento]], which was born in Milan at the end of 1922. It was started by a group of artists composed of [[Mario Sironi]], [[Achille Funi]], [[Leonardo Dudreville]], [[Anselmo Bucci]], [[Emilio Malerba]], [[Pietro Marussig]] and [[Ubaldo Oppi]] who, at the Pesaro Gallery in Milan, joined together in the new movement baptized Novecento by Bucci.<ref>{{Treccani|novecento_res-109c24a0-8bb2-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_(Enciclopedia-Italiana)/|NOVECENTO}}</ref> These artists, who felt they were translators of the spirit of the 20th century, came from different experiences and artistic currents, but linked by a common sense of "return to order" in art after the avant-garde experiments especially of Futurism: in this sense this artistic movement also adopted the name of [[Monumentalism|simplified Neoclassicism]]. The Novecento movement also manifested itself in literature with [[Massimo Bontempelli]] and above all in architecture with the famous architects [[Giovanni Muzio]], [[Giò Ponti]], {{ill|Paolo Mezzanotte|it}} and others. Some of the works of the major Lombard artists of the 20th century are exhibited at the [[Museo del Novecento]] in Milan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museodelnovecento.org/it/collezione|title=In Collezione|access-date=28 November 2017|language=it}}</ref>

===Literature===
{{main|Western Lombard literature}}
[[File:Maggi Carlo Maria.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|[[Carlo Maria Maggi]]]]

The first texts written in the vernacular [[Lombard language]] date back to the 13th century. These are mainly works of a didactic-religious nature; an example is the ''Sermon Divin'' by {{ill|Pietro da Barsegapè|it}}, which narrates the [[Passion of Jesus]]. Very important is the contribution to Lombard literature of [[Bonvesin de la Riva]], who wrote, among other works, the ''[[Liber di Tre Scricciur]]'', the ''De magnalibus urbis Mediolani'' ("The Wonders of Milan"), and an [[etiquette]], the ''De quinquaginta curialitatibus ad mensam'' ("Fifty table courtesies").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicitaliani.it/index139.htm|title=Opere di Bonvesin de la Riva|access-date=21 September 2017|language=it|archive-date=6 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206012104/http://www.classicitaliani.it/index139.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>

From the 15th century, the prestige of literary [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]] began to supplant the use of northern vernaculars which had been used, although influenced by the Florentine vernacular, also in chancellor and administrative contexts.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Josh|title=Testimonianze Di Una Precoce Toscanizzazione Nelle Lettere Commerciali del Mercante Milanese Francesco Tanso (?-1398)|publisher=Archivio Datini|location=Prato|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-437059133.html|access-date=8 February 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180818052204/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-437059133.html|archive-date=18 August 2018|language=it}}</ref> Despite this, starting from this century, there began to be the first signs of a true Lombard literature, with literary compositions in the Lombard language both in the western part of the region and in the eastern one.<ref>{{cite book|last=Haller|first=Hermann|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_F4C4AXtLFIC&dq=Giovanni+Bressani+Galeazzo+dagli+Orzi&pg=PA106|title=The Other Italy: The Literary Canon in Dialect|date=January 1999 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=978-0-8020-4424-2 |access-date=21 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Treccani|giovanni-paolo-lomazzo_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|LOMAZZO, Giovanni Paolo}}</ref>
[[File:Carlo_Porta.png|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Carlo Porta]]]]

The 17th century also saw the emergence of the figure of the playwright [[Carlo Maria Maggi]], who created, among other things, the Milanese mask of [[Meneghino]].<ref>{{cite book|author=[[AA.VV.]]|title=Maschere italiane|publisher=Edizioni Demetra|year=2002|page=116|isbn=978-8844026066|language=it}}</ref> Also in the 17th century, the first ''[[Bosinada|bosinade]]'' were born, occasional popular poems written on loose sheets of paper and posted in squares or read (or even sung) in public; they had great success and widespread diffusion until the first decades of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sapere.it/enciclopedia/bosinada.html|title=Bosinada|date=4 June 2020 |language=it|access-date=6 February 2024}}</ref> Milanese literature had a strong development in the 18th century: some important names emerged, including the famous poet [[Giuseppe Parini]], who wrote some compositions in the Lombard language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anticacredenzasantambrogiomilano.org/linguastoria/7001.html|title=Letteratura milanese - Il '700|access-date=21 September 2017|language=it}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://opac.unicatt.it/search~S13*ita?/cFONDO+Silvio+Cipriani-E-75/cfondo+silvio+cipriani+e+++++++75/-3,-1,,E/browse|title=Sistema bibliotecario e documentale|access-date=21 September 2017|language=it}}</ref>

The beginning of the 19th century was dominated by the figure of [[Carlo Porta]], recognized by many as the most important author of Lombard literature, and also included among the greatest poets of Italian national literature. With him, some of the highest peaks of literary expressiveness in the Lombard language were reached, which clearly emerged in works such as ''La Ninetta del Verzee'', ''Desgrazzi de Giovannin Bongee'', ''La guerra di pret'' e ''Lament del Marchionn de gamb avert''.<ref>{{Treccani|carlo-porta/|Pòrta, Carlo}}</ref> Milanese poetic production took on such important dimensions that in 1815 the scholar [[Francesco Cherubini]] published a four-volume [[anthology]] of Lombard literature, which included texts written from the 17th century to his day.<ref>{{Treccani|francesco-cherubini/|Cherubini, Francesco}}</ref>

Each of Lombardy's 12 provinces has its own musical traditions. Bergamo is famous for being the birthplace of [[Gaetano Donizetti]] and home of the Teatro Donizetti; Brescia hosts the 1709 Teatro Grande; Cremona is regarded as the origin of the violin and is home to several of the most prestigious [[luthier]]s;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.itinerarieluoghi.it/museo-del-violino-cremona/|title=Cremona e la tradizione liutaia: visita al museo del violino|date=25 October 2023 |access-date=1 February 2024|language=it}}</ref> and Mantua was one of the founding and most important cities in 16th- and 17th-century opera and classical music.

Other cities such as Lecco, Lodi, Varese and Pavia ([[Teatro Fraschini]]) also have rich musical traditions, but Milan is the centre of the Lombard musical scene. It was the workplace of [[Giuseppe Verdi]], one of the most famous and influential 19th-century opera composers. The province has acclaimed theatres, such as the [[Piccolo Teatro (Milan)|Piccolo Teatro]] and the Teatro Arcimboldi; however, the most famous is the 1778 [[Teatro alla Scala]] (popularly La Scala), the world's most famous opera house.<ref name="Griffin"/>

There are ten [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage sites]] wholly or partially located in Lombardy.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/|title = World Heritage List|access-date = 16 May 2015|website = UNESCO World Heritage Centre|publisher = UNESCO}}</ref> Some of these comprise several individual objects in different locations. One of the entries has been listed as natural heritage and the others are cultural heritage sites.

At [[Monte San Giorgio]] on the border with Swiss canton Ticino just south of [[Lake Lugano]], a wide range of marine [[Triassic]] fossils have been found. During the Triassic period, 245-230 million years ago, the area was a shallow tropical lagoon. Fossils include reptiles, fish, [[crustacean]]s and insects.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1090|title = Monte San Giorgio|access-date = 11 August 2023|website = UNESCO World Heritage Centre|publisher = UNESCO}}</ref>

The [[Rock Drawings in Valcamonica]] date to between 8000{{nbsp}}BC and 1000{{nbsp}}BC, covering prehistoric periods from the [[Epipaleolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] to the [[Iron Age]],  and constitute the largest collections of prehistoric [[petroglyph]]s in the world.<ref name="unesco2">{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/94|title=Rock Drawings in Valcamonica - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|access-date=29 June 2010}}</ref> The collection was recognized by [[UNESCO]] in 1979 and was Italy's first recognized World Heritage Site.

[[Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps]] are a series of prehistoric pile dwelling (or [[stilt house]]) settlements in and around the [[Alps]] built from about 5000 to 500 BC on the edges of lakes, rivers or wetlands. In 2011, 111 sites located variously in [[Switzerland]] (56), [[Italy]] (19), [[Germany]] (18), [[France]] (11), [[Austria]] (5) and [[Slovenia]] (2) were added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] list.<ref name=UNESCO3>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1363/|title=Prehistoric Pile Dwellings around the Alps|website=Whc.unesco.org}}</ref> In Slovenia, these were the first World Heritage Sites to be listed for their cultural value.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.washington.embassy.si/fileadmin/user_upload/dkp_51_vwa/newsletter/october_2011/Embassy_s_Newsletter__2011_-_14_-_10_finale.pdf |title=Pile-dwellings in the Ljubljansko Barje on UNESCO List |journal=Embassy Newsletter |publisher=Embassy of Slovenia in Washington |date=14 October 2011 |editor=Maša Štiftar de Arzu|access-date=6 February 2024}}</ref> Excavations conducted at some of the sites have yielded evidence regarding prehistoric life and the way communities interacted with their environment during the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]]s in Alpine Europe. These settlements are a unique group of exceptionally well-preserved and culturally rich archaeological sites, which constitute one of the most important sources for the study of early agrarian societies in the region.<ref name=UNESCO3/>

Another multi-centred site, [[Longobards in Italy, Places of Power (568–774 A.D.)]] consists of seven locations across mainland Italy which illustrate the history of the Lombard period. Two of the sites are in modern-day Lombardy: the fortifications (the ''castrum'' and the [[Torba Tower]]), and the church of Santa Maria ''foris portas'' ("outside the gates") has Byzantinesque frescoes at [[Castelseprio (archaeological park)|Castelseprio]], and the [[San Salvatore, Brescia|monastic complex of San Salvatore-Santa Giulia]] at Brescia.

The Church and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Convent of [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Santa Maria delle Grazie]] in Milan with "[[The Last Supper]]" by Leonardo da Vinci represent architectural and painting styles of the 15th-century Renaissance period.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/93|title = Church and Dominican Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie with "The Last Supper" by Leonardo da Vinci|access-date = 11 August 2023|website = UNESCO World Heritage Centre|publisher = UNESCO}}</ref> The towns Mantua and [[Sabbioneta]] are also listed as a combined World Heritage site relating to this period, here focussing more on town-planning aspects of the time than on architectural detail. While Mantua was rebuilt in the 15th and 16th centuries, according to Renaissance principles, Sabbioneta was planned as a new town in the 16th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1287|title = Mantua and Sabbioneta|access-date = 11 August 2023|website = UNESCO World Heritage Centre|publisher = UNESCO}}</ref>

The [[Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy]] are a group of nine sites in northwest Italy, two of which are in Lombardy. The concept of holy mountains can be found elsewhere in Europe. These sites were created as centres of pilgrimage by placing chapels in the natural landscape and were loosely modelled on the topography of Jerusalem. In Lombardy, Sacro Monte del Rosario di Varese and Sacro Monte della Beata Vergine del Soccorso, which were built in the early-to mid-17th century, mark the architectural transition from the late Renaissance to the Baroque style.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1068|title = Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy|access-date = 11 August 2023|website = UNESCO World Heritage Centre|publisher = UNESCO}}</ref>

[[Crespi d'Adda]] is a historic settlement and an outstanding example of the 19th and early 20th-century [[model village|"company towns"]] built in Europe and North America by enlightened industrialists to meet the workers' needs. The site is still intact and is partly used for industrial purposes, although changing economic and social conditions now threaten its survival.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/archive/periodicreporting/EUR/cycle01/section2/730-summary.pdf |title=UNESCO Reference 730|access-date=6 February 2024}}</ref> Since 1995 it has been on [[UNESCO]]'s list of [[World Heritage Sites]].

[[Mantua]] and [[Sabbioneta]] represent two approaches of [[Renaissance]] period town planning. Mantua (pictured), originating in Roman times and preserving structures from the 11th century, was renovated in the 15th and 16th centuries. On the other hand, Sabbioneta was founded in the second half of the 16th century by [[Vespasiano I Gonzaga]] and built with a [[grid plan]], according to the period's vision of an ideal city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1287|title=Mantua and Sabbioneta|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|access-date=26 June 2010|archive-date=28 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028083518/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1287/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Bernina Railway|Rhaetian Railway in the Albula/Bernina Landscapes]] is mostly located in the Swiss canton [[Grisons]], but extends over the border into [[Tirano]]. The site is listed because of the complex railway engineering (tunnels, viaducts and avalanche galleries) necessary to take the narrow-gauge railway across the main chain of the Alps.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rhaetian Railway in the Albula &#x2f; Bernina Landscapes |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1276/ |access-date=26 January 2024 |website=Whc.unesco.org}}</ref> The two railway lines were opened in several stages between 1904 and 1910.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rail routes |url=https://www.rhb.ch/en/unesco-world-heritage/rail-routes?ref=057sxl&cHash=5ce8bcb5f1772b123510314dc449c698 |access-date=16 January 2024 |website=Rhätische Bahn}}</ref>

The [[Venetian Works of Defence between the 16th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra – western Stato da Mar]] is a transnational system of fortifications that were built by the [[Republic of Venice]] on its [[Domini di Terraferma|mainland domains]] (''Stato da Terra'') and its territories stretching along the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast (''[[Stato da Mar]]'').

Milan, along with [[Manchester]], is one of only two cities in Europe that is home to two [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup/Champions League]] winning teams: [[Serie A]] football clubs [[AC Milan]] and [[Inter Milan|Inter]]. They are two of the most successful clubs in the world of football in terms of international trophies.

[[File:Carnevale di Bagolino 1.JPG|thumb|left|Typical masks of the {{ill|Bagolino Carnival|it|Carnevale di Bagolino}}, in the [[province of Brescia]]]]

There are numerous traditional festivals and meetings in Lombardy: cities and towns offer calendars full of events, some of which have ancient origins.

The [[Oh bej! Oh bej!]] is held in Milan on 7 and 8 December each year and commemorates the appointment of Saint [[Ambrose]] as bishop of the city.

The {{ill|Ambrosian Carnival|it|Carnevale Ambrosiano}} ({{langx|it|Carnevale Ambrosiano}}) is celebrated in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan]] and in the territories of some of the neighbouring [[diocese]]s. It lasts until the first Saturday of Lent.<ref name="AA.VV">{{cite book|title=Per conoscere la Lombardia (storia, geografia, usi e costumi)|author=[[AA.VV.]]|page=23|publisher=Ericart|year=2002|isbn=978-88-512-0111-1|language=it}}</ref>

[[File:Corsa ippica - Palio di Legnano 2014.JPG|thumb|The horse race of the [[Palio di Legnano]] 2014]]

The [[Palio di Legnano]] is held in [[Legnano|the city of the same name]] and in the [[Metropolitan City of Milan]], on the last Sunday of May. It is the historical re-enactment which celebrates the victory of the [[Lombard League]] over the emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]] in the [[battle of Legnano]] on 29 May 1176. The event includes a [[medieval pageant]] through the streets of the city and finally a [[horse race]] between the [[Contrade of Legnano|eight contrade]] in which Legnano is divided.

The historical re-enactment of the [[oath of Pontida]] is held in [[Pontida]], in the [[province of Bergamo]], on 7 March and commemorates the legendary oath of the Lombard League which should have been the prelude to the victorious war of the Lombard municipalities against Barbarossa.<ref name="AA.VV" />
