Damanhur is a historic city, which history can be dated back to the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]].<ref name=":02">{{Cite web |last=Peust |first=Carsten |title=Die Toponyme vorarabischen Ursprungs im modernen Ägypten |url=http://www.peust.de/ortsnamen_original.pdf |page=33}}</ref> The modern city has also absorbed the ancient villages ''Shubra al-Jadida'' ({{Langx|ar|شبرا الجديدة}}, {{Langx|cop|ϫⲉⲃⲣⲟ ⲙⲃⲉⲣⲓ}}), ''Tāmus'' ({{Langx|ar|طاموس‌}}), ''Askanida'' ({{Langx|ar|اسكنيدة}}) and ''Chortaso'' ({{Langx|ar|قرطسا}}, {{Langx|grc|Χορτασω}}).<ref>{{Cite web |date=1818 |title=Carte geographique de l'Egypte et des pays environnans by Pierre Jacotin |url=https://atlas.paths-erc.eu/map/saved/all_ms_places |website=PAThs – Archaeological Atlas of Coptic Literature }}{{Dead link|date=January 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Stefan |first=Timm |title=Das christlich-koptische Agypten in arabischer Zeit |year=1988 |pages=884–885}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=TM Places |url=https://www.trismegistos.org/place/8064 |access-date=2023-04-03 |website=www.trismegistos.org}}</ref>

The city's modern Arabic name comes from Coptic '''p-Timinhor''' ({{langx|cop|ⲡϯⲙⲓⲛ̀ϩⲱⲣ}}, {{IPA-cop|ptəmənhoːr|pronounced}}), which in turn is derived from {{Langx|egy|pꜣ-dmỉ-n-Ḥr.w|lit=the settlement of [[Horus]]}}, also attested in Aramaic ({{Langx|arc|תמנחור|translit=Temenkhūr}}).<ref name=":02" />

The Greeks called the city '''Hermopolis Mikra''' ({{langx|grc|Ἑρμοῦ πόλις μικρά}}).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bernand |first=A. |date=2021-12-13 |others=R. Talbert, Johan Åhlfeldt, Jeffrey Becker, W. Röllig, Tom Elliott, H. Kopp, DARMC, Sean Gillies, B.

The name of the city suggests that Horus, whom Greeks equated with [[Apollo]], was worshipped as the chief deity. However, the Greek name for the town, Hermopolis Mikra, suggests that [[Hermes]]/[[Thoth]] was the local god. This discrepancy is possibly due to a misinterpretation that persisted even after the Greeks had gained a better understanding of Egypt.<ref name="EB1911">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Damanhūr|volume=7|page=783|short=x}}</ref>

== History ==
In [[ancient Egypt]], the city was the capital of [[Lower Egypt]]'s 7th [[Nome (Egypt)|Nome]] of '''A-ment'''. It stood on the banks of a canal which connected the lake [[Mareotis]] with the [[Canopic]] or most westerly arm of the [[Nile]].<ref>[[Champollion]], ''L'Egypte'', vol. ii. p.&nbsp;249</ref> 

The city attracted the notice of numerous ancient geographers, including [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] ''s. v.'', [[Strabo]] (xvii. p.&nbsp;802), [[Ptolemy]] (iv. 5. § 46), and the author of the [[Antonine Itinerary]] (p.&nbsp;154). It is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[titular see]].

It was first made a provincial capital under [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] rule in [[11th century]], and in the [[Middle Ages]] it prospered as a caravan town on the post road from Cairo to Alexandria. It was severely damaged in 1302 by an earthquake, but in the late 14th century the [[Mamluk Sultanate|Mamluk]] caliph [[Barquq]] restored its fortifications to protect the city from Bedouins.

In 1799, the city [[List of massacres in Egypt|revolted]] against the French, who cruelly crushed the rebels, killing 1,500.

In 1986, the population of Damanhur was 188,939. The richly cultivated Beheira province gives rise to mainly agricultural industries which include cotton ginning, potato processing, and date picking. It also has a market for cotton and rice.

On the 10th of February 2023 six people, including three boys, were killed and at least 20 injured when an apartment building collapsed.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hendawi |first=Hamza |date=2023-02-10 |title=Three boys among six killed in building collapse north of Cairo |url=https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/2023/02/10/boy-of-10-among-four-killed-in-building-collapse-north-of-cairo/ |access-date=2023-02-15 |website=The National |language=en}}</ref>

The city gets average [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] during [[winter]], and rare [[rain]] during other [[season]]s. [[Hail]] and [[frost]] are not unknown specifically during winter.
