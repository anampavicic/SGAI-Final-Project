==History==
===Origins===
The area around present-day Okazaki has been inhabited for many thousands of years. Archaeologists have found remains from the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period.
Numerous remains from the [[Jōmon period]], and especially from the [[Yayoi period|Yayoi]] and [[Kofun period]]s, have been found, including many ''[[kofun]]'' burial mounds.

===Sengoku period===
During the [[Sengoku period]], the area was controlled by the [[Matsudaira clan]], a branch of which later rose to prominence as the [[Tokugawa clan]], who ruled Japan during the [[Edo period]].

===Edo period===
During this time, [[Okazaki Domain]], a feudal [[han (administrative division)|''han'']] was established to rule the immediate area around Okazaki and was entrusted to a ''[[fudai daimyō]]''.
Several smaller domains were in the present-day city limits, including Fukozu (later Mikawa-Nakajima), [[Okudono Domain]] and [[Nishi-Ohira Domain]]. The town prospered as a [[hatago|post station]] on the [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]] connecting [[Edo]] with [[Kyoto]].

===Meiji period===
Following the [[Meiji Restoration]], the modern town of Okazaki was established on October 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system in [[Nukata District, Aichi|Nukata District]] of [[Aichi Prefecture]]. On October 1, 1914, Okazaki annexed neighboring Hirohata Town. Okazaki was proclaimed a city on July 1, 1916.

The city suffered damage in both the [[1944 Tōnankai earthquake]] (which killed 9 people) and the [[1945 Mikawa earthquake]] (which killed 29 people). During [[World War II]], the July 19, 1945 [[Bombing of Okazaki in World War II|Bombing of Okazaki]] killed over 200 people and destroyed most of the city center. Although Okazaki was the location of an [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] airfield, military installations were not damaged in the attack.

===Modern Okazaki===
In 1955, through a series of mergers and consolidations, the area of Okazaki expanded considerably. The former towns of Iwazu, Fukuoka, and Yahagi, and the villages of Motojuku, Yamanaka, Kawai, Fujikawa, and Ryugai were all merged into Okazaki. The 1959 [[Typhoon Vera|Isewan Typhoon]] caused considerable damage, and killed 27 residents. On October 15, 1962, Okazaki annexed the neighboring town of Mutsumi.

Okazaki was proclaimed a [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] on April 1, 2003, with increased autonomy from the prefectural government. On January 1, 2006, the town of [[Nukata, Aichi|Nukata]] (from [[Nukata District, Aichi|Nukata District]]) was merged into Okazaki.

==Government==
[[File:Okazaki City Hall (2013.04.28) 02.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Okazaki City Hall]]

===Mayor-council===

===Prefectural Assembly===
The city contributes five members to the [[Aichi Prefectural Assembly]].

== Local attractions ==
=== Okazaki Castle ===
[[Okazaki Castle]] was originally built in 1455. Captured by the [[Matsudaira clan]] in 1524 (and probably relocated from the other side of the river), the castle remains associated with [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], even though the latter transferred to [[Edo]] in 1590. During the [[Edo period]] it served as the seat of the [[Okazaki Domain]] and dominated the city until the [[Meiji Restoration]].

=== Fireworks ===
Okazaki is famous for its [[fireworks]]. The Tokugawa shogunate restricted production of [[gunpowder]] outside of the immediate region of Okazaki (with few exceptions). Even today, more than 70% of Japan's fireworks are designed and manufactured here. A large fireworks festival, which people from all over Japan come to see, is held annually on the first Saturday in August in the area surrounding Okazaki Castle.

=== ''Hatchō miso'' ===
[[File:Hatcho-Miso-Kakukyu-9.jpg|thumb|''Hatchō [[miso]]'' fermenting in barrels in Okazaki]]
''Hatchō miso'' (八丁味噌) is a dark ''[[miso]]'' paste made using a process of steaming soybeans (instead of boiling) followed by maturation in cedar barrels under the weight of 3 tons of carefully stacked river stones for at least 2 years. Located 8 ''chō'' (''hatchō'', or approximately 900m) west of Okazaki Castle near the Yahagi river, there are two 8-cho miso companies — Maruya from 1337<ref>http://www.8miso.co.jp/english.html Maruya</ref> and Kakukyu.<ref>http://www.kakukyu.jp/global/english.asp Kakukyu</ref>

The old tiled buildings are heritage listed and Kaku has been a family business for 18 generations. It is one of the most famous ''miso'' producers in Japan, supplying the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] by appointment, and popular as a health food. 2006 [[Asadora|NHK morning drama serial]], ''Junjo Kirari'' (Sparkling Innocence) was largely filmed in and around the Hatchō miso grounds. Tours are available every 30 minutes and free samples are provided. Hatchō miso's health properties are considered so great that it was donated to [[Chernobyl]]'s citizens following the disaster, to help prevent and treat [[radiation sickness]].

=== Takisan ===
The Buddhist temple of Takisan-ji (7th century) includes several [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan]]. The main hall is from the [[Kamakura period]] and is the location of a fire festival held each February on the closest Saturday to the lunar calendar New Year. The distinctive ''[[Sanmon]]'' gate and the main image are designated as important cultural properties. Adjoining the temple is [[Takisan Tōshō-gū]], a [[Shinto Shrine]] built in 1646 by [[Tokugawa Iemitsu]].

==Culture==
=== Language ===
While the local [[Mikawa dialect]] is considered to be generally indistinguishable from what is considered modern standard [[Dialects of Japanese language|Japanese]], there are subtle and distinctive differences. Mikawa dialect has, on the other hand, substantial differences when compared to the dialect of [[Nagoya]] and western areas of Aichi, where the [[Nagoya dialect]] (also known as ''Owari-ben'', Owari being the traditional name for the Nagoya region) is the traditional dialect. Cognitively Mikawa-ben and modern contemporary Japanese are extremely close, in part due to the influence of the Tokugawa shogunate and accidents of history. In recent decades a large number of people moving into Okazaki and the surrounding cities (particularly to work in the motor vehicle industry) and mass media have influenced the local dialect, with the result that in day-to-day life more people are using only standard Japanese.
