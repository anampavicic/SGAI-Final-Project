'''Long An''' is a [[Provinces of Vietnam|province]] in the [[Mekong Delta]] region of southern [[Vietnam]]. The provincial capital is [[Tân An]] city, and other major districts and town include [[Kiến Tường]], [[Bến Lức]], [[Cần Giuộc District|Cần Giuộc]] and [[Đức Hòa]]. There are 15 districts within the province (included 1 provincial capital city and 1 district-level town).<ref>[http://www.longan.gov.vn/Pages/default.aspx Long An Government]</ref>

The region is between [[Ho Chi Minh City]] and [[Southeast (Vietnam)|Southeast]] region in the north and the [[Mekong Delta]]. Because of its low lying geography, it is susceptible to sea level rise caused by climate change.

== Geography ==
Long An is situated in an advantageous position in the [[Southern Key Economic Region of Vietnam]]. It serves as a bridge between [[Ho Chi Minh City]] in the north and 12 provinces in the [[Mekong Delta]] in the south. The province also has Cambodia to its west and the East Sea ([[South China Sea]]) to its east.

Long An is a low-lying coastal region, and therefore some areas of it are subject to flooding during the rainy season, which lasts from the beginning of August until November.

The province has numerous rivers. Two of the main ones are the [[Vàm Cỏ Đông River|Vàm Cỏ Đông]] and [[Vàm Cỏ Tay]], which connect with the [[Tiền River|Tiền]] to form a larger river system.  Another important river in the region is the [[Soài Rạp]].

== History ==
Archaeological sites show that, since [[ancient times]], Long An has been an important territory of the [[Funan]]-[[Zhenla|Zhenla kingdom]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Điều kiện tự nhiên, lịch sử |url=https://www.longan.gov.vn/dieu-kien-tu-nhien-lich-su |access-date=2024-11-05 |website=www.longan.gov.vn}}</ref> When [[Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh]] came to explore the South, Long An belonged to Gia Định prefecture. During the reign of [[Minh Mạng]], Long An belonged to Gia Định province and partly to Định Tường province. In the early days of French colonization, [[Nam Kỳ]] was divided into 21 provinces, and Long An was located within the two provinces of [[Tân An]] and [[Chợ Lớn]].<ref name=":0" />

== Administrative divisions ==
Long An is subdivided into 15 district-level sub-divisions:

* 13 districts:
** [[Bến Lức District|Bến Lức]]
** [[Cần Đước District|Cần Đước]]
** [[Cần Giuộc District|Cần Giuộc]]
** [[Châu Thành District, Long An|Châu Thành]]
** [[Đức Hòa District|Đức Hòa]]
** [[Đức Huệ District|Đức Huệ]]
** [[Mộc Hóa District|Mộc Hóa]]
** [[Tân Hưng District|Tân Hưng]]
** [[Tân Thạnh District, Long An|Tân Thạnh]]
** [[Tân Trụ District|Tân Trụ]]
** [[Thạnh Hóa District|Thạnh Hóa]]
** [[Thủ Thừa District|Thủ Thừa]]
** [[Vĩnh Hưng District|Vĩnh Hưng]]
* 1 district-level town:
** [[Kiến Tường]]
* 1 provincial city:
** [[Tân An, Long An|Tân An]] (capital)

They are further subdivided into 14 commune-level towns (or townlets), 166 communes, and 12 wards.

== Climate change concerns ==

Being a low-lying coastal region, Long An is particularly susceptible to floods resulting from [[Sea level rise|rises in sea level]] due to [[climate change]]. The [[Climate Change Research Institute]] at [[Can Tho University]] (''{{lang|vi|Trường Đại học Cần Thơ}}''), in studying the possible [[effects of climate change|consequences of climate change]], has predicted that 49% of Long An province is expected to be flooded if sea levels rise by one meter.<ref name="vnnnet-sealevel">[http://english.vietnamnet.vn/tech/2009/03/836977/ Mekong Delta: more flood and drought] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505180724/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/tech/2009/03/836977/ |date=2010-05-05 }}.
