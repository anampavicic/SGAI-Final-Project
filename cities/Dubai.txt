==Etymology==
Many theories have been proposed as to the origin of the word "Dubai". One theory suggests the word used to be the ''[[souq]]'' in Ba.<ref name=jundi>{{cite journal|last=Alyazya |date=July 2011 |script-title=ar:مسميات مناطق دبي قديماً |trans-title=Old names areas of Dubai |language=ar |journal=Al Jundi |volume=444|page=76}}</ref> An Arabic proverb says "''Daba Dubai''" ({{langx|ar|دبا دبي}}), meaning "They came with a lot of money."<ref name=MBR>{{cite web|url=http://www.sheikhmohammed.ae/vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=13d94c8631cb4110VgnVCM100000b0140a0aRCRD |title=Old Dubai |access-date=24 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203194320/http://www.sheikhmohammed.ae/vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=13d94c8631cb4110VgnVCM100000b0140a0aRCRD |archive-date=3 February 2014}}</ref>

According to Fedel Handhal, a scholar on the UAE's history and culture, the word Dubai may have come from the word ''dabba'' ({{langx|ar|[[wikt:دب|دب]]}}) (a past tense derivative of ''yadub'' ({{langx|ar|[[wikt:يدب|يدب]]}}), which means "to creep"), referring to the slow flow of [[Dubai Creek]] inland.

The poet and scholar Ahmad Mohammad Obaid traces it to the same word, but to its alternative meaning of "baby [[locust]]" ({{langx|ar|[[wikt:جراد|جراد]]}}) due to the abundance of locusts in the area before settlement.<ref name="UAEI">{{cite web |url = http://www.uaeinteract.com/news/rss-news.asp?ID=24335 |title = How Did Dubai, Abu Dhabi and other Cities Get Their Names?

In 1833, following tribal feuding, members of the [[House of Al Falasi|Al Bu Falasah]] tribe seceded from Abu Dhabi and established themselves in Dubai. The exodus from Abu Dhabi was led by [[Obeid bin Said bin Rashid|Obeid bin Saeed]] and [[Maktoum bin Butti bin Suhail|Maktoum bin Butti]], who became joint leaders of Dubai until Ubaid died in 1836, leaving Maktoum to establish the [[Al Maktoum|Maktoum dynasty]].<ref name=":0" />

Dubai signed the [[General Maritime Treaty of 1820]] with the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] along with other [[Trucial States]], following the [[Persian Gulf campaign of 1819|British campaign in 1819]] against the [[Ras Al Khaimah]]. This led to the 1853 [[Perpetual Maritime Truce]]. Dubai also – like its neighbours on the [[Trucial States|Trucial Coast]] – entered into an exclusivity agreement in which the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] took responsibility for the emirate's security [[Trucial States–United Kingdom Treaty of 1892|in 1892]].

In 1901, [[Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum]] established Dubai as a free port with no taxation on imports or exports and also gave merchants parcels of land and guarantees of protection and tolerance. These policies saw a movement of merchants not only directly from Lingeh,<ref name=":12">{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|page=2236}}</ref> but also those who had settled in [[Ras Al Khaimah]] and [[Sharjah]] (which had historical links with Lingeh through the [[Al-Qasimi|Al Qawasim]] tribe) to Dubai. An indicator of the growing importance of the port of Dubai can be gained from the movements of the steamer of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, which from 1899 to 1901 paid five visits annually to Dubai. In 1902 the company's vessels made 21 visits to Dubai and from 1904 on,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|page=743}}</ref> the steamers called fortnightly – in 1906, trading 70,000 tones of cargo.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Father of Dubai|last=Wilson|first=Graeme|publisher=Media Prima|year=1999|page=34}}</ref> The frequency of these vessels only helped to accelerate Dubai's role as an emerging port and trading hub of preference. Lorimer notes the transfer from Lingeh "bids fair to become complete and permanent",<ref name=":12" /> and also that the town had by 1906 supplanted Lingeh as the chief entrepôt of the Trucial States.<ref name="Lorimer 1915 454">{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf Vol II|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|page=454}}</ref>

The "great storm" of 1908 struck the pearling boats of Dubai and the coastal emirates towards the end of the pearling season that year, resulting in the loss of a dozen boats and over 100 men. The disaster was a major setback for Dubai, with many families losing their breadwinners and merchants facing financial ruin. These losses came at a time when the tribes of the interior were also experiencing poverty. In a letter to the Sultan of [[Muscat]] in 1911, Butti laments, "Misery and poverty are raging among them, with the result that they are struggling, looting and killing among themselves."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Father of Dubai|last=Wilson|first=Graeme|publisher=Media Prima|year=1999|page=39}}</ref>

In 1910, in the [[The Hyacinth incident|Hyacinth incident]] the town was bombarded by [[HMS Hyacinth (1898)|HMS ''Hyacinth'']], with 37 people killed.

===Pre-oil Dubai===
Dubai's geographical proximity to [[Iran]] made it an important trade location. The town of Dubai was an important port of call for foreign tradesmen, chiefly those from Iran, many of whom eventually settled in the town. By the beginning of the 20th century, it was an important port.<ref name="britannica" /> At that time, Dubai consisted of the town of Dubai and the nearby village of [[Jumeirah]], a collection of some 45 ''areesh'' (palm leaf) huts.<ref name="Lorimer 1915 454" /> By the 1920s, many Iranians settled in Dubai permanently, moving across the Persian Gulf. By then, amenities in the town grew and a modern quarter was established, [[Al Bastakiya]].<ref name=":03"/>{{Rp|page=|pages=21–23}}

Dubai was known for its [[pearl]] exports until the 1930s; the pearl trade was damaged irreparably by the 1929 [[Great Depression]] and the innovation of [[cultured pearls]]. With the collapse of the pearling industry, Dubai fell into a deep depression and many residents lived in poverty or migrated to other parts of the Persian Gulf.<ref name="hist_trad" />

In 1937 an oil exploration contract was signed which guaranteed [[Royalty payment|royalty]] rights for Dubai and concessionary payments to Sheikh [[Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum|Saeed bin Maktoum]]. However, due to [[World War II]], oil would not be struck until 1966.<ref name=":03"/>{{Rp|page=|pages=36–37}}

In the early days since its inception, Dubai was constantly at odds with [[Abu Dhabi]]. In 1947, a border dispute between Dubai and Abu Dhabi on the northern sector of their mutual border escalated into war.<ref name=dxbadconflict>{{cite web |url=http://www.archiveeditions.co.uk/titledetails.asp?tid=120 |title=The UAE: Internal Boundaries And The Boundary With Oman.

Despite a lack of oil, Dubai's ruler from 1958, Sheikh [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], used revenue from trading activities to build infrastructure. Private companies were established to build and operate infrastructure, including electricity, telephone services and both the ports and airport operators.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|publisher=Longman|year=1996|isbn=978-0-582-27728-1|location=London|page=260}}</ref> An airport of sorts (a runway built on salt flats) was established in Dubai in the 1950s and, in 1959, the emirate's first hotel, the Airlines Hotel, was constructed.

Sheikh Rashid commissioned [[John Harris (architect)|John Harris]] from British architectural construction firm [[Halcrow Group|Halcrow]], to create the city's first master plan in 1959. Harris imagined a Dubai that would rise from the historic centre on Dubai Creek, with an extensive road system, organised zones, and a town centre, all of which could feasibly be built with the limited financial resources at the time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Elshestawy |first1=Yasser |title=Planning Middle Eastern Cities: An Urban Kaleidoscope |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1-134-41010-7}}</ref>

1959 saw the establishment of Dubai's first telephone company, 51% owned by IAL (International Aeradio Ltd) and 49% by Sheikh Rashid and local businessmen and in 1961 both the electricity company and telephone company had rolled out operational networks.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|title=The Trucial States|last=Donald.|first=Hawley|date=1970|publisher=Allen & Unwin|isbn=978-0-04-953005-8|location=London|page=245|oclc=152680}}</ref> The water company (Sheikh Rashid was chairman and majority shareholder) constructed a pipeline from wells at Awir and a series of storage tanks and, by 1968, Dubai had a reliable supply of piped water.<ref name=":5" />

On 7 April 1961, the Dubai-based MV ''[[MV Dara|Dara]]'', a five thousand ton British flagged vessel that plied the route between [[Basra]] (Iraq), [[Kuwait]] and [[Bombay]] (India), was caught in unusually high winds off Dubai. Early the next morning in heavy seas off Umm al-Quwain, an explosion tore out the second class cabins and started fires. The captain gave the order to abandon ship but two lifeboats capsized and a second explosion occurred. A flotilla of small boats from Dubai, [[Sharjah]], [[Ajman]] and [[Umm al-Quwain]] picked up survivors, but 238 of the 819 persons on board were lost in the disaster.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/general/fifty-years-on-the-tragedy-of-vessel-mv-dara-lingers-1.789262|title=Fifty years on, the tragedy of vessel MV Dara lingers|last=Reporter|first=Mariam M.

The construction of Dubai's first airport was started on the northern edge of the town in 1959 and the terminal building opened for business in September 1960. The airport was initially serviced by [[Gulf Aviation]] (flying [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Dakotas]], Herons and [[Vickers Viscount|Viscounts]]) but [[Iran Air]] commenced services to [[Shiraz]] in 1961.<ref name=":5" />

In 1962 the British [[Political officer (British Empire)|Political Agent]] noted that "Many new houses and blocks of offices and flats are being built... the Ruler is determined, against advice [from the British authorities] to press on with the construction of a jet airport... More and more European and Arab firms are opening up and the future looks bright."<ref name=":2" />

In 1962, with expenditure on infrastructure projects already approaching levels some thought imprudent, [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Sheikh Rashid]] approached his brother-in-law, [[Ahmad bin Ali Al Thani|the Ruler of Qatar]], for a loan to build the first bridge crossing [[Dubai Creek]]. This crossing was finished in May 1963 and was paid for by a toll levied on the crossing from the Dubai side of the creek to the [[Deira]] side.<ref name=":4" />

BOAC was originally reluctant to start regular flights between [[Mumbai|Bombay]] and Dubai, fearing a lack of demand for seats. However, by the time the asphalt runway of [[Dubai Airport]] was constructed in 1965, opening Dubai to both regional and long haul traffic, a number of foreign airlines were competing for landing rights.<ref name=":4" /> In 1970 a new airport terminal building was constructed which included Dubai's first [[duty-free shop]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Fly Buy Dubai|last = Wilson|first = Graeme|publisher = Media Prima|year = 2008|isbn = 9789948859437|location = UAE|page = 58}}</ref>

Throughout the 1960s Dubai was the centre of a lively [[gold]] trade, with 1968 imports of gold at some £56 million. This gold was, in the vast majority, re-exported – mainly to customers who took delivery in international waters off [[India]]. The [[Coinage of India|import of gold to India]] had been banned and so the trade was characterized as smuggling, although Dubai's merchants were quick to point out that they were making legal deliveries of gold and that it was up to the customer where they took it.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Gold smuggling boosts Dubai economy|last=Thomas|first=Anthony|date=3 March 1969|work=The Times}}</ref>

In 1966, more gold was shipped from [[London]] to Dubai than almost anywhere else in the world (only [[France]] and [[Switzerland]] took more), at 4 million ounces. Dubai also took delivery of over $15 million worth of watches and over 5 million ounces of silver. The 1967 price of gold was $35 an ounce but its market price in India was $68 an ounce – a healthy markup. Estimates at the time put the volume of gold imports from Dubai to India at around 75% of the total market.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Trucial States|first=Donald|last=Hawley|date=1970|publisher=Allen & Unwin|location=London|page=204|oclc=152680|isbn=<!--978-0049530058-->0049530054}}</ref>

===Oil era===
[[File:Dubai Water Canal Business Bay.jpg|thumb|View of [[Business Bay]]]]
After years of exploration following large finds in neighbouring [[Abu Dhabi]], oil was eventually discovered in territorial waters off Dubai in 1966, albeit in far smaller quantities. The first field was named "Fateh" or "good fortune". This led to an acceleration of Sheikh Rashid's infrastructure development plans and a construction boom that brought a massive influx of foreign workers, mainly Asians and Middle Easterners. Between 1968 and 1975 the city's population grew by over 300%.<ref name="pop7">{{cite web |url=http://www.ite.org/traffic/documents/AB00H5001.pdf |title=Historic population statistics |access-date=31 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326030537/http://www.ite.org/traffic/documents/AB00H5001.pdf |archive-date=26 March 2009}}</ref>

As part of the infrastructure for pumping and transporting oil from the Fateh field, located offshore of the Jebel Ali area of Dubai, two 500,000-gallon storage tanks were built, known locally as "Kazzans",<ref>{{cite web|url = http://dubaiasitusedtobe.com/pagesnew/ChicagoBeachDubai.shtm|title = How Chicago Beach got its name...then lost it!|access-date = 20 August 2016|website = Dubai As It Used To Be|last = Chapman|first = Len|url-status=live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160709050015/http://www.dubaiasitusedtobe.com/pagesnew/ChicagoBeachDubai.shtm|archive-date = 9 July 2016|df = dmy-all}}</ref> by welding them together on the beach and then digging them out and floating them to drop onto the seabed at the Fateh field. These were constructed by the [[Chicago Bridge & Iron Company]], which gave the beach its local name (Chicago Beach), which was transferred to the Chicago Beach Hotel, which was demolished and replaced by the [[Jumeirah Beach Hotel]] in the late 1990s. The Kazzans were an innovative oil storage solution which meant supertankers could moor offshore even in bad weather and avoided the need to pipe oil onshore from Fateh, which is some 60 miles out to sea.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Trucial States|last=Donald.|first=Hawley|date=1970|publisher=Allen & Unwin|isbn=978-0-04-953005-8|location=London|page=222|oclc=152680}}</ref>

Dubai had already embarked on a period of infrastructural development and expansion. Oil revenue flowing from 1969 onwards supported a period of growth with Sheikh Rashid embarking on a policy of building infrastructure and a diversified trading economy before the emirate's limited reserves were depleted. Oil accounted for 24% of GDP in 1990 but had fallen to 7% of GDP by 2004.<ref name=":1" />

Critically, one of the first major projects Sheikh Rashid embarked upon when oil revenue started to flow was the construction of [[Port Rashid]], a deep-water free port constructed by British company Halcrow. Originally intended to be a four-berth port, it was extended to sixteen berths as construction was ongoing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2024}} The project was an outstanding success, with shipping queuing to access the new facilities. The port was inaugurated on 5 October 1972, although its berths were each pressed into use as soon as they had been built. Port Rashid was to be further expanded in 1975 to add a further 35 berths before the larger port of Jebel Ali were constructed.<ref name=":1" />

Port Rashid was the first of a swath of projects designed to create a modern trading infrastructure, including roads, bridges, schools and hospitals.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Father of Dubai|last = Wilson|first = Graeme|publisher = Media Prima|year = 1999|isbn = 9789948856450|location = UAE|page = 151}}</ref>

===Reaching the UAE's Act of Union===
[[File:Adi with the three rulers of Dubai.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adi Bitar]] in a meeting with Sheiks [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Rashid Al Maktoum]], [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Mohammad Al Maktoum]] and [[Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Maktoum Al Maktoum]] in Dubai, 1968]]
Dubai and the other "[[Trucial States]]" had long been a [[British protectorate]] where the British government took care of foreign policy and defence, as well as arbitrating between the rulers of the Eastern Gulf, the result of a treaty signed in 1892 named the "Exclusive Agreement". This was to change with PM [[Harold Wilson]]'s announcement, on 16 January 1968, that all British troops were to be withdrawn from "East of Aden". The decision was to pitch the coastal emirates, together with [[Qatar]] and [[Bahrain]], into fevered negotiations to fill the political vacuum that the British withdrawal would leave behind.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Spirit of the Union|last = Al Maktoum|first = Mohammed bin Rashid|publisher = Motivate|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1-86063-330-0|location = UAE|pages = 27–39}}</ref>

The principle of union was first agreed upon between the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], and Sheikh Rashid of Dubai on 18 February 1968 meeting in an encampment at Argoub Al Sedirah, near Al Semeih, a desert stop between the two emirates.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Spirit of the Union|last = Maktoum|first = Mohammed bin Rashid|publisher = Motivate|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1-86063-330-0|location = UAE|page = 30}}</ref> The two agreed to work towards bringing the other emirates, including Qatar and Bahrain, into the union. Over the next two years, negotiations and meetings of the rulers followed—often stormy—as a form of union was thrashed out. The nine-state union was never to recover from the October 1969 meeting where British intervention against aggressive activities by two of the Emirates resulted in a walk-out by Bahrain and Qatar. They dropped out of talks, leaving six of the seven "trucial" emirates to agree on union on 18 July 1971.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Abed|first1=Ibrahim|url=https://archive.org/details/unitedarabemirat00vine|title=United Arab Emirates: a new perspective|last2=Hellyer|first2=Peter|publisher=Trident Press|year=2001|isbn=978-1-900724-47-0|location=London|pages=129–133|url-access=limited}}</ref>

On 2 December 1971, Dubai, together with Abu Dhabi, [[Sharjah]], [[Ajman]], [[Umm al-Quwain]] and [[Fujairah]] joined in the Act of Union to form the [[United Arab Emirates]]. The seventh emirate, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the UAE on 10 February 1972, following [[Iran]]'s annexation of the RAK-claimed [[Tunbs]] islands.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Islands and International Politics in the Persian Gulf: The Abu Musa and Tunbs in Strategic Context|url=https://archive.org/details/islandsinternati00ahma|url-access=limited|last=Ahmadi|first=Kourosh|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/islandsinternati00ahma/page/n106 96]}}</ref>

In 1973, Dubai joined the other emirates to adopt a uniform currency: the [[United Arab Emirates dirham|UAE dirham]].<ref name="britannica" /> In that same year, the prior [[monetary union]] with Qatar was dissolved and the UAE dirham was introduced throughout the Emirates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centralbank.ae/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=148&Itemid=106|title=Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates|access-date=11 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203063733/http://www.centralbank.ae/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=148&Itemid=106|archive-date=3 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Modern Dubai===

Throughout the 1970s, Dubai experienced continued growth fueled by revenues generated from oil and trade, even as the city witnessed an influx of immigrants fleeing the [[Lebanese civil war]].<ref name="nyt2">"Beirut Showing Signs of Recovery From Wounds of War".

The [[Gulf War]] in early 1991 had a negative financial impact on the city, with depositors and traders withdrawing money and trade. However, Dubai rebounded in a changing political climate and prospered. In the late 1990s, various foreign trading communities—initially from [[Kuwait]], during the Gulf War, and later from [[Bahrain]], amidst the [[Shia]] unrest—relocated their businesses to Dubai.<ref name="asianaffairs">Davidson, Christopher, ''The Emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai: Contrasting Roles in the International System''.

In the early 2000s, construction of artificial islands on the coast of Dubai, known as the [[Palm Islands]] and the [[The World (archipelago)|The World Islands]], has begun. The [[Burj Khalifa]] was opened in Dubai in 2010, surpassing the [[Taipei 101]] and officially gaining its title as the tallest skyscraper in the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

Dubai is situated on the Persian Gulf coast of the United Arab Emirates and is roughly at sea level ({{convert|16|m|abbr=on|disp=or}} above). The emirate of Dubai shares borders with Abu Dhabi in the south, [[Emirate of Sharjah|Sharjah]] in the northeast, and the [[Sultanate of Oman]] in the southeast. [[Hatta, United Arab Emirates|Hatta]], a minor [[exclave]] of the emirate, is surrounded on three sides by Oman and by the emirates of Ajman (in the west) and Ras Al Khaimah (in the north). The Persian Gulf borders the western coast of the emirate. Dubai is positioned at {{Coord|25.2697|N|55.3095|E}} and covers an area of {{convert|1588|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, which represents a significant expansion beyond its initial {{convert|1500|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} designation due to [[Land reclamation#Land amounts added|land reclamation from the sea]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Dubai lies directly within the [[Arabian Desert]]. However, the topography of Dubai is significantly different from that of the southern portion of the UAE in that much of Dubai's landscape is highlighted by sandy desert patterns, while gravel deserts dominate much of the southern region of the country.<ref name=geo1>[http://uaeinteract.com/uaeint_misc/pdf/perspectives/14.pdf Environmental Development and Protection in the UAE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172707/http://www.uaeinteract.com/uaeint_misc/pdf/perspectives/14.pdf |date=3 March 2016}}. Aspinall, Simon</ref> The sand consists mostly of crushed shell and coral and is fine, clean and white. East of the city, the salt-crusted coastal plains, known as ''[[sabkha]]'', give way to a north–south running line of dunes. Farther east, the dunes grow larger and are tinged red with [[iron oxide]].<ref name=pop7 />

The flat sandy desert gives way to the Western [[Hajar Mountains]], which run alongside Dubai's border with Oman at Hatta. The Western Hajar chain has an arid, jagged and shattered landscape, whose mountains rise to about {{convert|1300|m|0|abbr=off}} in some places. Dubai has no natural river bodies or oases; however, Dubai does have a natural inlet, [[Dubai Creek]], which has been dredged to make it deep enough for large vessels to pass through. Dubai also has multiple gorges and waterholes, which dot the base of the Western Al Hajar mountains. A vast sea of sand dunes covers much of southern Dubai and eventually leads into the desert known as [[The Empty Quarter]]. [[Seismic]]ally, Dubai is in a very stable zone—the nearest seismic fault line, the Zagros Fault, is {{convert|200|km|0|abbr=off}} from the UAE and is unlikely to have any seismic impact on Dubai.<ref name=seismic>[http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/science/a-straight-line-to-disaster Far enough from the fault lines.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727103103/http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/science/a-straight-line-to-disaster |date=27 July 2012}} ''The National'', 23 April 2008.</ref> Experts also predict that the possibility of a [[tsunami]] in the region is minimal because the Persian Gulf waters are not deep enough to trigger a tsunami.<ref name=seismic />

The sandy desert surrounding the city supports wild grasses and occasional date palms. Desert hyacinths grow in the ''sabkha'' plains east of the city, while acacia and [[prosopis cineraria|ghaf]] trees grow in the flat plains within the proximity of the Western Al Hajar mountains. Several indigenous trees such as the date palm and [[neem]] as well as imported trees such as the [[eucalyptus]] grow in Dubai's natural parks. The [[MacQueen's bustard]], [[striped hyena]], [[caracal]], [[fennec fox|desert fox]], falcon and [[Arabian oryx]] are common in Dubai's desert. Dubai is on the migration path between Europe, Asia and Africa, and more than 320 migratory bird species pass through the emirate in spring and autumn. The waters of Dubai are home to more than 300 species of fish, including the [[hammour]]. The typical marine life off the Dubai coast includes tropical fish, jellyfish, coral, [[dugong]], dolphins, whales and sharks. Various types of turtles can also be found in the area including the [[hawksbill]] turtle and [[green turtle]], which are listed as endangered species.<ref>[http://www.gowealthy.com/gowealthy/wcms/en/home/articles/entertainment/events-and-festivals/Flora-fauna-of-Dubai-B0odU6b3Lu.html Flora and fauna of Dubai] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702064554/http://www.gowealthy.com/gowealthy/wcms/en/home/articles/entertainment/events-and-festivals/Flora-fauna-of-Dubai-B0odU6b3Lu.html |date=2 July 2009}} gowealthy.com</ref><ref>[http://www.uaeinteract.com/nature/default.asp Natural UAE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126010401/http://www.uaeinteract.com/nature/default.asp |date=26 January 2010}} UAE Interact.

Dubai has been ruled by the [[Al Maktoum]] family since 1833; the emirate is an [[absolute monarchy]]. Dubai citizens participate in the electoral college to vote representatives to the [[Federal National Council]] of the 'UAE'. The ruler, His Highness Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]], is also the vice-president and [[Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates]] and member of the Supreme Council of the Union (SCU). Dubai appoints 8 members in two-term periods to the [[Federal National Council]] (FNC) of the UAE, the supreme federal legislative body.<ref name=uaegovt>US Library of Congress – Legislative Branches</ref>

The [[Dubai Municipality]] (DM) was established by the then ruler of Dubai, [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], in 1954 for purposes of city planning, citizen services and upkeep of local facilities.<ref name=dmhistory>Organizational Chart.

This state of affairs has been enabled by a complex range of factors: the lack of extradition treaties with many countries, banking secrecy, liberal visa policies, low taxes, a large expatriate community in which shady figures are easily absorbed and welcomed, a non-transparent real estate market that readily enables money laundering, and not least, the monarchical dictatorship of the Maktoum family which facilitates it through deliberately lax legislation and policy.<ref>Dubai's Golden Sands, Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), 12 June 2018; [https://www.occrp.org/en/goldensands/]</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">Christian Baghai, 'How Dubai Became a Safe Haven for Europe's Most Wanted Criminals', Medium, 28 December 2023</ref>

A victim of domestic violence, Tori Towey faced abuse since getting married in March 2024. She was lived in Dubai and was working as a flight attendant for the Emirates Airlines. When she attempted to seek help for the first time in Dubai, Towey was mocked by an Emirati police officer. The authorities charged her of attempt to suicide and illegal consumption of alcohol, along with banning her from leaving Dubai. Towey was assisted by Radha Sterling, who questioned Ireland's travel advice, claiming it is "insufficient" to assist visitors, particularly women, in understanding how to attend to officials in the UAE. Sterling said it is difficult to explain to foreign travellers about how they can stay safe in the Emirates.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dubai is 'very unsafe' for women going through marital breakdown, says human rights advocate |date=12 July 2024 |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2024/07/12/dubai-is-very-unsafe-for-women-going-through-marital-breakdown-says-human-rights-advocate/ |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20240722054248/https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2024/07/12/dubai-is-very-unsafe-for-women-going-through-marital-breakdown-says-human-rights-advocate/ |archive-date= 22 July 2024 |access-date=28 August 2024}}</ref>

The government's decision to diversify from a trade-based, oil-reliant economy to one that is service- and tourism-oriented made [[real estate|property]] more valuable, resulting in property appreciation from 2004 to 2006. A longer-term assessment of Dubai's property market, however, showed depreciation; some properties lost as much as 64% of their value from 2001 to November 2008.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Dubai's Palm Jumeirah sees prices fall as crunch moves in |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/constructionandproperty/3489393/Dubais-Palm-Jumeirah-sees-prices-fall-as-crunch-moves-in.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=20 November 2008 |access-date=20 November 2008 |first=Louise |last=Armitstead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201011113/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/constructionandproperty/3489393/Dubais-Palm-Jumeirah-sees-prices-fall-as-crunch-moves-in.html |archive-date=1 December 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> The large-scale real estate development projects have led to the construction of some of the tallest skyscrapers and largest projects in the world such as the [[Emirates Towers]], the [[Burj Khalifa]], the [[Palm Islands]] and the most expensive hotel, the [[Burj Al Arab]].<ref name=burjalarab>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/545499.stm |title=World's Tallest Hotel Opens Its Doors |work=BBC News |date=1 December 1999 |access-date=31 July 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619185856/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/545499.stm |archive-date=19 June 2009}}</ref> Dubai's property market experienced a major downturn in 2008<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|date=17 March 2012|title=Dubai: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly|url=http://drshem.com/2011/09/25/dubai-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418063228/http://drshem.com/2011/09/25/dubai-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/|archive-date=18 April 2012|access-date=17 March 2012|website=}}</ref> and 2009 as a result of the slowing economic climate.<ref name="Propertywire.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.propertywire.com/news/middle-east/job-losses-property-decline-dubai-200812032193.html |title=Job losses hasten property decline in Dubai but medium-long term outlook upbeat |publisher=Propertywire.com |date=3 December 2008 |access-date=14 July 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119123812/http://www.propertywire.com/news/middle-east/job-losses-property-decline-dubai-200812032193.html |archive-date=19 January 2009 }}</ref> By early 2009, the situation had worsened with the [[Great Recession]] taking a heavy toll on property values, construction and employment.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/world/middleeast/12dubai.html "Laid-Off Foreigners Flee as Dubai Spirals Down"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170111092442/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/world/middleeast/12dubai.html |date=11 January 2017}} article by Robert F.

In Dubai, many of the property owners are residents or genuine investors. However, the 2020 Data from the [[Center for Advanced Defense Studies|Centre for Advanced Defense Studies]] (C4ADS) exposed that a number of real estate owners in the city were either facing international sanctions or were involved in criminal activities. Some others were public officials, with a minimal possibility of purchasing it with their known incomes. The report "Dubai Uncovered" mentioned names of 100 [[Russian oligarchs]], public officials and Europeans involved in [[money laundering]]. Benefiting from Dubai's lack of proper real estate regulations, a number of corrupt people owned a house away from home, laundered their illicit money, and invested to store their wealth. Names of some of such questionable figures included [[Daniel Kinahan]], [[Alexander Borodai]], Roman Lyabikhov, Tibor Bokor, [[Ruslan Baisarov]], Miroslav Výboh and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/dubai-uncovered-data-leak-exposes-how-criminals-officials-and-sanctioned-politicians-poured-money-into-dubai-real-estate|title=Dubai Uncovered: Data Leak Exposes How Criminals, Officials, and Sanctioned Politicians Poured Money Into Dubai Real Estate|access-date=3 May 2022|website=OCCRP}}</ref>

For years, Dubai has been labeled as a major hub for laundering illicit cash, primarily through its real estate market. Due to the UAE's lack of proper regulations and extradition treaties with many countries, fugitives found it to be a perfect hideout. The "Dubai Unlocked" investigation by journalists from 75 media outlets, in coordination with OCCRP and E24, revealed how Dubai's real estate market became a haven for criminals, money launderers, drug lords, fugitives, political figures accused of corruption, and sanctioned individuals to hide their money in Dubai. The investigation was based on 2020 and 2022 data leaks, primarily from the Dubai Land Department and publicly owned utility companies. The EU Tax Observatory and Norway's Centre for Tax Research evaluated that in 2022, the foreign ownership in Dubai's real estate market was worth approximately $160 billion. Until 2022, there was no obligation on real estate agents, brokers, and lawyers in Dubai to report large cash or cryptocurrency transactions to authorities.<ref>{{cite news|title=What Is 'Dubai Unlocked'?

In September 2024, Dubai has tightened its crypto regulation by implementing stricter rules for companies promoting digital assets in the region. These regulations require firms to provide a disclaimer and disclose the risks involved in trading crypto in their promotional materials.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Martha |first=Chimamanda |date=September 26, 2024 |title=Dubai Steps Up Crypto Regulation with New Marketing Guidelines |url=https://www.coinspeaker.com/dubai-steps-up-crypto-regulation-marketing/}}</ref>

Following February 2022, the property prices in Dubai increased significantly, as wealthy Russians started investing in the UAE's real estate after the Ukraine invasion. Since 2020, property prices in Dubai increased by 124%. Meanwhile, the EU Tax Observatory and Norway's Centre for Tax Research revealed that Russians invested around $6.3 billion in Dubai's existing and in-developed properties, since 2022. The increase in property prices pushed out the British expatriates, and forced them to look for property outside Dubai in cities like Ras Al Khaimah.<ref>{{cite news|last=Swan|first=Melanie|title=Russian cash threatens to price British expats out of Dubai|date=8 September 2024 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/09/08/russia-property-cash-ukraine-uae-dubai-brits/ |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20240909035031/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/09/08/russia-property-cash-ukraine-uae-dubai-brits/ |archive-date=9 September 2024 |access-date=2 November 2024}}</ref>

Dubai has a wide range of parks like Safa Park, Mushrif Park, and Hamriya Park. Each park is uniquely distinct from the others. Mushrif Park showcases different houses from around the world. A visitor can check out the architectural features of the outside as well as the inside of each house.

Some of the most popular beaches in Dubai are Umm Suqeim Beach, Al Mamzar Beach Park, JBR Open Beach, Kite Beach, Black Palace Beach and Royal Island Beach Club. [[Mastercard]]'s Global Destination Cities Index 2019 found that tourists spend more in Dubai than in any other country.

In October 2019, Dubai loosened its liquor laws for the first time, under which it allowed tourists to purchase alcohol from state-controlled stores. Previously, alcohol was accessible only for locals with special licences. The crucial policy shift came as the [[United Arab Emirates]] witnessed a severe economic crisis that led to a drop in alcohol sales by volume.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hotworldreport.com/world-news/dubai-loosens-liquor-laws-as-uae-alcohol-sales-slump/|title=Dubai loosens liquor laws as UAE alcohol sales slump|access-date=24 October 2019|website=Hot World Report|archive-date=30 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191030085950/https://hotworldreport.com/world-news/dubai-loosens-liquor-laws-as-uae-alcohol-sales-slump/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Dubai has a rich collection of buildings and structures of various [[architectural styles]]. Many modern interpretations of [[Islamic architecture]] can be found here, due to a boom in construction and architectural innovation in the Arab World in general, and in Dubai in particular, supported not only by top Arab or international architectural and engineering design firms such as [[Al Hashemi]] and [[Aedas]], but also by top firms of New York and Chicago.<ref name="hist_karim"/> As a result of this boom, modern Islamic – and world – architecture has literally been taken to new levels in skyscraper building design and technology.

Dubai is increasingly activating its logistics and ports in order to participate in trade between Europe and China or Africa in addition to oil transport. For this purpose, ports such as Port of Jebel Ali or Mina Rashid are rapidly expanded and investments are made in their technology. The country is historically and currently, part of the Maritime [[Silk Road]] that runs from the Chinese coast to the south via the southern tip of [[India]] to [[Mombasa]], from there through the Red Sea via the [[Suez Canal]] to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region to the northern Italian hub of [[Trieste]] with its rail connections to [[Central Europe]], Eastern Europe and the [[North Sea]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.seatrade-maritime.com/asia/china-invest-34bn-dubai-warehousing-and-trading |title=China to invest $3.4bn in Dubai warehousing and trading |date=29 April 2019 |access-date=18 March 2021 |archive-date=29 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210129214931/https://www.seatrade-maritime.com/asia/china-invest-34bn-dubai-warehousing-and-trading |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.porttechnology.org/news/what-are-the-top-ports-in-the-middle-east/ |title=What are the top ports in the Middle East? |access-date=18 March 2021 |archive-date=1 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210201132128/https://www.porttechnology.org/news/what-are-the-top-ports-in-the-middle-east/ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.business.hsbc.ae/en-gb/ae/article/chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-beacons-new-trade-in-menat |title=China's Belt and Road Initiative beacons new trade-in MENAT |access-date=18 March 2021 |archive-date=14 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414000706/https://www.business.hsbc.ae/en-gb/ae/article/chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-beacons-new-trade-in-menat |url-status=live}}</ref>

The UAE's culture mainly reflects traditional Arab culture. The influence of Arab and Islamic culture on its architecture, music, attire, cuisine, and lifestyle is very prominent as well. Five times every day, Muslims are called to prayer from the [[minaret]]s of mosques that are scattered around the country. Major holidays in Dubai include [[Eid al-Fitr]], which marks the end of [[Ramadan]], and [[National Day]] (2 December), which marks the formation of the United Arab Emirates.<ref>{{cite web |date=25 November 2015 |title=Gulf News Community |url=http://gulfnews.com/guides/life/community/how-the-uae-was-born-1.1610731 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220102503/http://gulfnews.com/guides/life/community/how-the-uae-was-born-1.1610731 |archive-date=20 December 2016 |access-date=11 December 2016 |website=gulfnews.com}}</ref>

The UAE traditional [[ghutrah]] is white and is held in place by an accessory called "[[Agal (accessory)|egal]]", which resembles a black cord.

Healthcare in Dubai can be divided into two different sectors: public and private. Each Emirate is able to dictate healthcare standards according to their internal laws, although the standards and regulations rarely have extreme differences. Public hospitals in Dubai were first built in the late 1950s and continued to grow with public health initiatives. There are now 28 hospitals in Dubai, 6 public and 22 private, with 3 more major hospitals scheduled to be built by 2025.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.emirates247.com/news/emirates/uae-expo-2020-bid-in-good-health-dubai-gets-new-hospitals-2013-08-19-1.518053 |title=UAE Expo 2020 bid in good health: Dubai gets new hospitals |date=19 August 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623003659/http://www.emirates247.com/news/emirates/uae-expo-2020-bid-in-good-health-dubai-gets-new-hospitals-2013-08-19-1.518053 |archive-date=23 June 2015}}</ref>
