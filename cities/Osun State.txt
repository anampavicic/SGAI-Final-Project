'''Osun State''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|ʃ|uː|n}}; {{lang-yo|Ìpínlẹ̀ Ọ̀ṣun}}), occasionally known as the '''State of Osun''' by the state government, is a [[States of Nigeria|state]] in [[South West (Nigeria)|southwestern]] [[Nigeria]]; bounded to the east by [[Ekiti State|Ekiti]] and [[Ondo State|Ondo]] states for 84&nbsp;km and for 78&nbsp;km respectively, to the north by [[Kwara State]] for 73&nbsp;km, to the south by [[Ogun State]] for 84&nbsp;km and to the west by [[Oyo State]], mostly across the River Osun. Named for the [[River Osun]]—a vital river which flows through the state—the state was formed from the southeast of Oyo State on 27 August 1991 and has its capital as the city of [[Osogbo]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Onyeakagbu |first1=Adaobi |title=See how all the 36 Nigerian states got their names |url=https://www.pulse.ng/lifestyle/food-travel/see-how-all-the-36-nigerian-states-got-their-names/g8bkn2c |website=Pulse.ng |access-date=25 December 2021}}</ref><ref name="Creation">{{cite web |title=This is how the 36 states were created |url=https://www.pulse.ng/news/local/nigerian-states-this-is-how-the-36-states-were-created/mdtnq3e |website=Pulse.ng |date=24 October 2017 |access-date=22 December 2021}}</ref>

Of the 36 [[states of Nigeria]], Osun is the [[List of Nigerian states by area|ninth smallest in area]] and [[List of Nigerian states by population|25th most populous state]] with an estimated population of about 4.7 million as of 2016.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Osun - Nigeria {{!}} Data and Statistics |url=https://knoema.com/atlas/Nigeria/Osun?mode=amp |access-date=20 July 2022 |website=knoema.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Population 2006-2016 |url=https://nigerianstat.gov.ng/elibrary/read/474 |website=[[National Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria|National Bureau of Statistics]] |access-date=21 December 2021}}</ref> Geographically, the state is divided between the [[Nigerian lowland forests]] in most of the state and the drier [[Guinean forest–savanna mosaic]] in the north. The major geographical features are rivers including the state's namesake, the River Osun which bisects the state's interior before forming much of the state's southwestern border with [[Oyo State]] and flowing south. Other important rivers are the [[Erinle River|Erinle]] and [[Oba River|Oba]] rivers, both Osun [[Tributary|tributaries]] which flow from the north before meeting the Osun along the [[Points of the compass|southwestern]] border. Among the state's fauna are [[mona monkey]], [[common kestrel]], [[purple heron]], and [[royal antelope]], along with some of Nigeria's last remaining [[Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee]] and [[African forest elephant]] which inhabit the heavily threatened forests along the southern borders with [[Ondo State|Ondo]] and [[Ogun State|Ogun]] states.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Okekedunu |first1=J.O. |last2=Ogunjemite |first2=Babafemi |last3=Adeyemo |first3=I.A. |last4=Olaniyi |first4=Oluwatobi |title=Daily activity budget of the Mona monkey was studied in Ibodi Monkey Forest, Osun State, Nigeria |journal=FUTA Journal of Research in Sciences |date=January 2014 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301498867 |access-date=18 January 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Owolabi |first1=Bibitayo Ayobami |last2=Adewumi |first2=Adebayo |last3=Odewumi |first3=Oluyinka Sunday |last4=Okosodo |first4=Ehi Francis |last5=Orimaye |first5=Jacob Oluwafemi |title=Survey of Avifauna Species of a Degraded Environment: Case Study of Osun State University, College of Agriculture, Ejigbo, Nigeria |journal=Merit Research Journal of Environmental Science and Toxicology |date=March 2018 |volume=6 |issue=2 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335950843 |access-date=18 January 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Uwaegbulam |first1=Chinedum |title=Conservationists discover chimpanzees in South West |url=https://guardian.ng/property/conservationists-discover-chimpanzees-in-south-west/ |website=[[The Guardian (Nigeria)|The Guardian]] |date=14 November 2016 |access-date=18 January 2022}}</ref>

Osun State is primarily inhabited by the [[Yoruba people]], mainly of the Ibolo, [[Ifẹ]], [[Igbomina]], [[Ijesha]], and Oyo subgroups.

In the pre-colonial period, the area that is now Osun State was split up between various Western Yoruba states with some states being town-based as others were part of larger empires like the [[Oyo Empire]]. From 1877 to 1893, Western Yoruba states fought the [[Kiriji War]] alongside other Eastern Yoruba groups against Eastern Yoruba groups; the [[war]] ended in a British-brokered stalemate before the area was colonized and incorporated into the British [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate]] which later merged into [[British Nigeria]] in 1914. After independence in 1960, the area of now-Osun was a part of the post-independence [[Western Region, Nigeria|Western Region]] until 1967 when the region was split and the area became part of the [[Western State (Nigeria)|Western State]]. In 1976, the Western State was split and the state's west became [[Oyo State]]. Fifteen years later, [[Oyo State|Oyo]] State's east was broken off to form Osun State.

Economically, Osun State is largely based around agriculture, mainly of [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[cassava]], [[millet]], [[maize]], [[potato]] and [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]] crops. Other key industries are services, especially in urban areas, along with [[artisanal mining]] and livestock herding. Osun is home to several of Nigeria's most famous landmarks, including the campus of [[Obafemi Awolowo University]], one of Nigeria's pre-eminent institutions of higher learning. The university is located in the ancient town of [[Ile-Ife|Ile-Ifẹ]], an important early center of political and religious development for Yoruba culture. Other important cities and towns include the ancient kingdom-capitals of [[Ila, Nigeria|Ila Orangun]], [[Iragbiji]], [[Ada, Osun|Ada]], [[Ikirun]], [[Oke-Ila]] Orangun, [[Ipetu-Ijesha]], [[Ijebu-Jesa]], Erin Oke, [[Ipetumodu]], [[Ede, Nigeria|Ede]], [[Iwo, Nigeria|Iwo]], [[Ejigbo]], [[Ibokun]], [[Odeomu|Ode-Omu]], [[Otan Ayegbaju]], Ifetedo, [[Esa-Oke]], [[Ilesa]], [[Okuku, Osun State|Okuku]], Otan-Ile and [[Igbajo]]. Osun State is additionally noted for having the second highest literacy rate in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Action Plan - Nigeria|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/ED/pdf/Nigeria.pdf}}</ref>

== History ==
The modern State of Osun was created on 27 August 1991 from part of the old [[Oyo State]].
