'''Rosario''', officially the '''Municipality of Rosario''' ({{lang-tgl|Bayan ng Rosario}}),  is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Cavite]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 110,807 people.{{PH census|current}}

Formerly known as  '''''Salinas''''', Rosario has an area of {{convert|5.6|sqkm|sp=us}}, making it the most densely populated city/municipality in Cavite at 16,473 per km<sup>2</sup>. With the continuous expansion of Metro Manila, the municipality is now included in Manila [[conurbation]] which reaches [[Lipa, Batangas]] in its southernmost part. It is accessible by land and water transportation.<ref name="rosario">[http://www.cavite.gov.ph/cavite%20home/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=208 Province of Cavite Website] - Rosario</ref>

==Etymology==
There are three religious versions for naming the town "Rosario." These are:

The first version says, the image of the Madonna and the Child was found one day floating on the water by a group of kids playing along the seashore. They played with the image, using it as a toy and afterwards hid it in the bushes near the sea. Every time they came back, however, they would see the image already floating leisurely on the water, as if waiting for them. They thought it strange, but could not explain how the image got back to the water.

Not long after their elders learned about the image and took it to an empty nipa shack. Thus began a public veneration of the [[Madonna and Child]]. The hut was transformed into a place of worship. News of miraculous happenings attributed to the image spread around. The religious fervor was so great and the people were moved by the image that they decided to adopt it as the patroness of the town and changed the name ''Salinas Marcella'' to ''Rosario''.

The different names given to the town are remembered. Marcella exists as one of the national roads of the town. Salinas is associated with the finest and famous smoked fish (Tinapang Salinas) produced by the townspeople.

Rosario was formerly called Tejero, which may have originated from the word ''tejer'' (Spanish to weave) because weaving fish nets was then the main occupation of the women. Rosario was also called Salinas derived from the word ''sal'' (Spanish salt) during the Philippine Revolution because salt-making was a prime industry of the town.  The place was likewise called Marcella or Marcelles due to its proximity to the sea (“mar” in Spanish). Rosario was, finally, named in honor of their patroness [[Nuestra Señora Virgen del Santissimo Rosario, Reina de Caracol]] or (''[[Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary]]'').<ref name="rosario" />

== History ==
On October 22, 1845, Spanish Governor General Narciso Claveria promulgated a Decree for the establishment of a new town comprising Salinas-Leiton and Tierra Alta of San Francisco de Malabon, what is now the city of General Trias. On October 27, Don Juan Arlegui, Vicar-General of the Archdiocese of Manila informed the Politico-Military Governor of Cavite Don Miguel Roca, that he was designated by the Governor-General to look for a person of unquestionable integrity who will be entrusted with the money for the construction of the church building.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=About Rosario|url=https://rosariocavite.com.ph/about-rosario|access-date=2021-10-15|website=rosariocavite.com.ph|language=en}}</ref>

On November 3, 1845, presbyter Don Mamerto Mariano Ner, who was at that time one of the priests of the Curia of Manila, was appointed as the first parish priest and served until December 1866.<ref name=":0" />

The municipality of Rosario was originally a part of San Francisco de Malabon (now [[General Trias]]) which itself was part of Silang.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sembrano |first=Edgar Allan |date=2022-10-04 |title=Silang seeks to save cultural treasure church |url=https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/428801/silang-seeks-to-save-cultural-treasure-church/ |access-date=2023-11-27 |website=Lifestyle.INQ |language=en-US}}</ref> It became an independent municipality in 1846, one year after the founding of the Santissimo Rosario Parish. The second smallest town in Cavite Province, Rosario has now emerged into the " biggest, not in terms of its land area nor its per capita income but because of the great transitions that occurred with the town's political, social, cultural and economic developments since 1845.<ref name=":0" />

On October 15, 1903, Rosario and Cavite El Viejo (now [[Kawit]]) were merged with [[Noveleta]] by virtue of Act No. 947 enacted by the [[Taft Commission|Philippine Commission]].<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=947|title=An Act Reducing the Twenty-Three Municipalities of the Province of Cavite to Eleven|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%20947|date=October 15, 1903|accessdate=June 17, 2023}}</ref> In 1911, Rosario regained its independent status as a municipality of Cavite by virtue of Executive Order No. 92.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=EO|number=92|title=Separating the former municipality of Rosario from that of Neleta, Cavite|date=January 11, 1911}}</ref>  <!-- http://youseemore.com/san_carlos/uploads/OFFICIAL%20GAZETTE%20INDEX%20%201902%20-1912.pdf ; exact date of the effectivity of independent status is not available online, so keep it undated in 1911 -->

== Geography ==

It is flanked by Noveleta on the east, [[Manila Bay]] on the north, General Trias on the southeast and Tanza on the south-west.<ref name="rosario" />

=== Land area ===

[[File:Sardine fish being dried under the Sun from Rosario, Cavite, Philippines.jpg|thumb|left|Tinapa being dried up under the Sun in Barangay Wawa Dos]]

Fishing is a major economic activity due to the abundant fishing grounds particularly in Barangays Wawa, Sapa Muzon and Ligtong. The Rosario Fish Port in Barangay Sapa is a major fishing port. Predominant cottage industries related to fishing include smoked fish (''tinapa'') processing, fish drying (''daing''), fish paste (''[[bagoong]]'') making, fish sauce (''[[Bagoong#Patis|patis]]'') making and canning.  Marine species caught within municipal fishing grounds include squid, mackerel, slipmouth, herring, goatfish, tuna, mullet, porgy, shrimp, barracuda, cavalla, snapper, catfish and roundscad.
Salinas is also the birthplace of the well-known Marina’s bibingka and the local Cavite version of pasit luglog, also known as pasit palabok, which was introduced by Aling Ely’s carinderia.  Both uses the local ingredients of tinapa flakes and kesong puti otherwise known as casillo. 

The Fil-Oil Development and Management Corporation (FMDC) has begun developing {{convert|134|ha|sp=us}} of the Philippine National Oil Corporation property into a special economic zone, the [[Cavite Economic Zone]], that will include an industrial estate, low-cost housing, and a new port facility. A proposed reclamation will increase the land area of Barangay Sapa II and III by {{convert|200|ha|sp=us}}.

On November 20, 2009, [[SM Prime Holdings]], the largest mall-operator in the country, opened [[SM City Rosario]], its 36th mall.{{clear-left}}
