'''Bến Tre''' is a province of [[Vietnam]]. It is one of the country's southern provinces, and is situated in the [[Mekong Delta]]. It is also famous for its coconuts and the [[Coconut Religion]] nationwide.

==Etymology==
The origin of the province’s name is still unclear as it was first inhabited by the [[Khmer people]], though some speculated it may have been called ''Kompong Russei''. Its original name was then later altered by incoming waves of immigration and settlement by ethnic [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] into ''Bến Tre.''<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kiernan |first=Ben |title=Việt Nam: A history from earliest times to the present |date=2017 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |pages=10 |language=English}}</ref> In [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], “Bến Tre” literally means “bamboo port”, which is quite inaccurate considering it is regionally famous for its [[Coconut|Coconuts]].

==History==
In what has been called "the start of the Vietnam War", in January and February 1960, the Việt Cộng attacked and took temporary control of several districts in Bến Tre, then known as Kiến Hòa.<ref>Pringle, James, "Meanwhile: The quiet town where the Vietnam War began", ''The New York Times'', 223 March 2004</ref> The Việt Cộng set up "people's committees", and confiscated land from landlords and redistributed it to poor farmers. One of the leaders of the uprising was Madame [[Nguyễn Thị Định]], who led the all-female "Long Hair Army".

Although the South Vietnamese army (ARVN) recaptured the villages, uprisings spread to many other areas of South Vietnam. The uprisings were spontaneous rather than planned.<ref>Asselin, Pierre (2013). ''Hanoi's Road to the Vietnam War, 1954–1965''. Berkeley: University of California Press. p. 73.</ref>

==Administration==
Bến Tre is subdivided into 9 district-level subdivisions.
The eight districts are
[[Ba Tri District|Ba Tri]],
[[Bình Đại District|Bình Đại]],
[[Châu Thành District, Bến Tre|Châu Thành]],
[[Chợ Lách District|Chợ Lách]],
[[Giồng Trôm District|Giồng Trôm]],
[[Mỏ Cày Bắc District|Mỏ Cày Bắc]],
[[Mỏ Cày Nam District|Mỏ Cày Nam]], and
[[Thạnh Phú District|Thạnh Phú]].
There is also one provincial city of [[Bến Tre]] (capital).
They are further subdivided into 7 commune-level towns (or townlets), 147 communes, and 10 wards. See also [[List of communes in Bến Tre province]].

==Geography==
Geographically, Bến Tre is wedged between the two main branches of the Tiền Giang River, which is itself one of the two main branches of the [[Mekong]]. The province's northern boundary is formed by the [[Tiền River|Tiền Giang]]'s main course, while the province's southern boundary is formed by the Tiền Giang's largest branch (which breaks away from the Tiền Giang just upriver from Bến Tre province). Between the Tiền Giang and its main branch are two smaller branches, passing through the middle of Bến Tre.

The entire province is criss-crossed with a network of smaller rivers and canals. The extensive irrigation that this provides makes Bến Tre a major producer of [[rice]], but also means that the area is prone to flooding. The Climate Change Research Institute at [[Can Tho University|Cần Thơ University]], in studying the possible [[effects of climate change|consequences of climate change]], has predicted that 51% of Bến Tre province can be expected to be flooded if sea levels rise by 1 meter.<ref name="vnnnet-sealevel">[http://english.vietnamnet.vn/tech/2009/03/836977 "Mekong Delta: more flood and drought"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505180724/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/tech/2009/03/836977 |date=May 5, 2010 }}. VietnamNet Bridge. 19 March 2009.</ref> Bến Tre province is, on average, only {{Convert|1.25|m|sp=us}} above sea level.

==Transportation==
Construction on the [[Rạch Miễu Bridge]], which links Bến Tre to neighboring [[Tiền Giang province]] to its north, was started in 2002. The bridge was finished and opened for traffic on 19 January 2009. Before that time, Bến Tre was only accessible to automobiles via ferry.
