==History==
{{Main|History of Georgia (U.S. state)}}

Before settlement by [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]], Georgia was inhabited by the [[Mound Builders|mound building]] cultures. The Province of Georgia was founded by British General [[James Oglethorpe]] at Savannah on February 12, 1733, a year after its creation as a new British colony.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://georgia.gov/georgia-facts-and-symbols|title=Georgia Facts and Symbols |website=Georgia.gov|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524123552/http://georgia.gov/georgia-facts-and-symbols|archive-date=May 24, 2014}}</ref> It was administered by the [[Trustees for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in America]] under a charter issued by (and named for) [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]. The Trustees implemented an elaborate plan for the colony's settlement, known as the [[Oglethorpe Plan]], which envisioned an agrarian society of [[Yeoman|yeoman farmers]] and prohibited slavery. The colony was [[Invasion of Georgia (1742)|invaded by the Spanish]] in 1742, during the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]]. In 1752, after the government failed to renew subsidies that had helped support the colony, the Trustees turned over control to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|crown]]. Georgia became a [[Crown colony#History|crown colony]], with a governor appointed by the king of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-816 |title=Trustee Georgia, 1732–1752 |publisher=New Georgia Encyclopedia |first1=Edward J. |last1=Cashin |date=July 27, 2009 |access-date=October 24, 2010 |archive-date=August 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831065402/http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-816 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The [[Province of Georgia]] was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that revolted against [[British Empire|British rule]] in the [[American Revolution]] by signing the 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. The State of Georgia's first constitution was ratified in February 1777.

After the [[Creek War|Creek War (1813–1814)]], General [[Andrew Jackson]] forced the [[Muscogee Nation|Muscogee (Creek) tribes]] to surrender land to the state of Georgia, including in the [[Treaty of Fort Jackson|Treaty of Fort Jackson (1814)]], surrendering 21 million acres in what is now southern Georgia and central Alabama, and the [[Treaty of Indian Springs (1825)]].<ref name="Remini">{{cite book|last=Remini|first=Robert|title=Andrew Jackson: The Course of American Empire, 1767–1821.

The resulting influx of [[American pioneer|American settlers]] put pressure on the [[Federal government of the United States|federal U.S. government]] to take land from the [[Cherokee Nation (1794–1907)|Cherokee Nation]]. In 1830, President [[Andrew Jackson]] signed into law the [[Indian Removal Act]], sending many eastern Indian nations to [[Indian reservation|reservations]] in present-day Oklahoma, including all of Georgia's tribes. Despite the Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'' (1832) that U.S. states were not permitted to redraw Indian boundaries, President Jackson and the state of Georgia ignored the ruling. In 1838, his successor, [[Martin Van Buren]], dispatched federal troops to gather the tribes and deport them west of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]. This forced relocation, known as the [[Trail of Tears]], led to the death of more than four thousand Cherokees.

The bomb was thought by the Department of Energy to lie buried in silt at the bottom of [[Wassaw Sound]].<ref>{{cite news |title=For 50 Years, Nuclear Bomb Lost in Watery Grave |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18587608&t=1566568815867 |work=NPR |date=February 3, 2008 |access-date=August 23, 2019 |archive-date=May 10, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210510145909/https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18587608&t=1566568815867 |url-status=live }}</ref>

By the 1960s, the proportion of African Americans in Georgia had declined to 28% of the state's population, after waves of migration to the North and some immigration by whites.<ref name="pop/perc" /> With their voting power diminished, it took some years for African Americans to win a state-wide office. [[Julian Bond]], a noted civil rights leader, was elected to the state House in 1965, and served multiple terms there and in the state senate.

Atlanta Mayor [[Ivan Allen Jr.]] testified before Congress in support of the Civil Rights Act, and Governor [[Carl Sanders]] worked with the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration to ensure the state's compliance. [[Ralph McGill]], editor and syndicated columnist at the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]'', earned admiration by writing in support of the Civil Rights Movement. In 1970, newly elected Governor [[Jimmy Carter]] declared in his inaugural address that the era of racial segregation had ended. In 1972, Georgians elected [[Andrew Young]] to Congress as the first African American Congressman since the [[Reconstruction era]].

In 1980, construction was completed on an expansion of what is now named [[Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] (ATL). The busiest and most efficient airport in the world, it accommodates more than a hundred million passengers annually.<ref name=HJAA>{{cite web |title=Atlanta's Hartsfield–Jackson International: Facts About The World's Busiest Airport |url=http://amaconferencecentersspeak.com/atlantas-hartsfield-jackson-international-facts-about-the-worlds-busiest-airport/ |website=amaconferencecentersspeak.com |publisher=American Management Association |access-date=January 27, 2019 |date=March 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128044530/http://amaconferencecentersspeak.com/atlantas-hartsfield-jackson-international-facts-about-the-worlds-busiest-airport/ |archive-date=January 28, 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Employing more than 60,000 people, the airport became a major engine for economic growth.<ref name=HJAA/> With the advantages of cheap real estate, low taxes, [[right-to-work law]]s and a regulatory environment limiting government interference, the Atlanta metropolitan area became a national center of finance, insurance, technology, manufacturing, real estate, logistics, and transportation companies, as well as the film, convention, and trade show businesses. As a testament to the city's growing international profile, in 1990 the [[International Olympic Committee]] selected [[Atlanta]] as the site of the [[1996 Summer Olympics]]. Taking advantage of Atlanta's status as a transportation hub, in 1991 [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] established its headquarters in the suburb of [[Sandy Springs]]. In 1992, construction finished on [[Bank of America Plaza (Atlanta)|Bank of America Plaza]], the tallest building in the U.S. outside of New York or Chicago. On February 19th, 2003, Georgia adopted its current [[Flag of Georgia (U.S. state)|state flag]], resembling the state's first official flag. In 2024, it was announced that Atlanta would host multiple games during the [[2026 FIFA World Cup]], which further substantiated the economic investment and growth in the city and state.

===Boundaries===
Beginning from the Atlantic Ocean, the state's eastern border with South Carolina runs up the [[Savannah River]], northwest to its origin at the [[confluence]] of the [[Tugaloo River|Tugaloo]] and [[Seneca River (South Carolina)|Seneca Rivers]]. It then continues up the Tugaloo (originally Tugalo) and into the [[Chattooga River]], its most significant [[tributary]]. These bounds were decided in the 1797 [[Treaty of Beaufort]], and tested in the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in the two ''[[Georgia v. South Carolina]]'' cases in 1923 and 1989.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The border then takes a sharp turn around the tip of [[Rabun County, Georgia|Rabun County]], at [[35th parallel north|latitude 35°N]], though from this point it diverges slightly south (due to inaccuracies in the original survey, conducted in 1818).<ref name=saporta/> This northern border was originally the Georgia and North Carolina border all the way to the [[Mississippi River]], until [[Tennessee]] was divided from [[North Carolina]], and the Yazoo companies induced the legislature of Georgia to pass an act, approved by the governor in 1795, to sell the greater part of Georgia's territory presently comprising [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcoybLve0aQC&pg=PA30|author=Ulrich Bonnell Phillips|title=Georgia and state rights: a study of the political history of Georgia from the Revolution to the Civil War|publisher=Annual Report of American Historical Association for the 57th US Congress, 1901|page=30|access-date=October 23, 2012|year=1902|archive-date=February 6, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230206005320/https://books.google.com/books?id=fcoybLve0aQC&pg=PA30|url-status=live}}</ref>

The state's western border runs in a straight line south-southeastward from a point southwest of [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], to meet the [[Chattahoochee River]] near [[West Point, Georgia|West Point]]. It continues downriver to the point where it joins the [[Flint River (Georgia)|Flint River]] (the confluence of the two forming Florida's [[Apalachicola River]]); the southern border goes almost due east and very slightly south, in a straight line to the [[St. Marys River (Florida/Georgia)|St. Mary's River]], which then forms the remainder of the boundary back to the ocean.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The water boundaries are still set to be the original [[thalweg]] of the rivers. Since then, several have been inundated by lakes created by dams, including the [[ACF River Basin|Apalachicola/Chattahoochee/Flint]] point now under [[Lake Seminole]].{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

===Geology and terrain===

[[File:Map of Georgia elevations.png|thumb|USGS map of Georgia elevations]]

Georgia consists of five principal [[physiographic regions of the United States|physiographic regions]]: The [[Cumberland Plateau]], [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]], [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]], and the [[Atlantic coastal plain]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Georgia Overview |url=https://narsal.uga.edu/gap/georgia/ |website=uga.edu |publisher=Natural Resources Spatial Analysis Lab, University of Georgia |access-date=August 15, 2021 |location=Athens, Georgia |archive-date=August 15, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210815190551/https://narsal.uga.edu/gap/georgia/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Each region has its own distinctive characteristics. For instance, the region, which lies in the northwest corner of the state, includes limestone, sandstone, shale, and other sedimentary rocks, which have yielded construction-grade limestone, barite, ocher, and small amounts of coal.

===Ecology===
{{Main|Ecology of Georgia (U.S. state){{!}}Ecology of Georgia}}

The state of Georgia has approximately 250 tree species and 58 protected plants. Georgia's native trees include [[Juniperus virginiana|red cedar]], a variety of pines, oaks, hollies, [[Taxodium|cypress]], [[Liquidambar styraciflua|sweetgum]], scaly-bark and white [[hickory|hickories]], and [[sabal palmetto]]. East Georgia is in the subtropical coniferous forest biome and conifer species as other broadleaf evergreen flora make up the majority of the southern and coastal regions. [[Gelsemium sempervirens|Yellow jasmine]] and [[Kalmia latifolia|mountain laurel]] make up just a few of the flowering shrubs in the state.

[[White-tailed deer]] are found in nearly all counties of Georgia. The [[northern mockingbird]] and [[brown thrasher]] are among the 160 bird species that live in the state.

Reptiles include the [[eastern diamondback]], [[Agkistrodon contortrix|copperhead]], and [[Agkistrodon piscivorus|cottonmouth]] snakes as well as alligators; amphibians include [[salamander]]s, frogs and [[toad]]s. There are about 79 species of reptile and 63 amphibians known to live in Georgia. The Argentine black and white tegu is currently an invasive species in Georgia. It poses a problem to local wildlife by chasing down and killing many native species and dominating habitats.<ref>Tegus – Georgia Invasive Species Task Force {{Full citation needed|date=December 2021}}</ref>

The most popular freshwater game fish<!-- not sure "gamefish" should be here per se. More under tourism perhaps. --> are [[trout]], [[bream]], [[bass (fish)|bass]], and [[catfish]], all but the last of which are produced in state hatcheries for restocking. Popular saltwater game fish include [[red drum]], [[spotted seatrout]], [[flounder]], and [[tarpon]]. [[Porpoise]]s, whales, [[shrimp]], [[oyster]]s, and [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crabs]] are found inshore and offshore of the Georgia coast.

The colonial settlement of large numbers of [[Scottish American]], [[English American]] and [[Scotch-Irish American]]s in the mountains and Piedmont, and coastal settlement by some [[English American]]s and African Americans, have strongly influenced the state's culture in food, language and music. The concentration of African slaves repeatedly "imported" to coastal areas in the 18th century from rice-growing regions of West Africa led to the development of [[Gullah]]-Geechee language and culture in the Low Country among African Americans. They share a unique heritage in which many African traditions of food, religion and culture were retained.

Until 1964, Georgia's state government had the longest unbroken record of single-party dominance, by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], of any state in the Union. This record was established largely due to the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement of most blacks]] and many poor whites by the state in its constitution and laws in the early 20th century. Some elements, such as requiring payment of poll taxes and passing literacy tests, prevented blacks from registering to vote; their exclusion from the political system lasted into the 1960s and reduced the Republican Party to a non-competitive status in the early 20th century.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://umich.edu/~lawrace/votetour6.htm | work=Race, Voting Rights, and Segregation | publisher=University of Michigan |title=On the eve of complete Black disenfranchisement, 1900 | access-date=October 15, 2016 | archive-date=October 18, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018043625/http://umich.edu/~lawrace/votetour6.htm | url-status=live }}</ref>

The whites dealt with this problem of potential political power by the 1908 amendment, which in practice disenfranchised blacks and poor whites, nearly half of the state population. It required that any male at least 21 years of age wanting to register to vote must also be of good character and able to pass a test on citizenship, be able to read and write provisions of the U.S. and Georgia constitutions, or own at least forty acres of land or $500 in property. Any Georgian who had fought in any war from the [[American Revolution]] through the [[Spanish–American War]] was exempted from these additional qualifications. More importantly, any Georgian descended from a veteran of any of these wars also was exempted. Because, by 1908, many white Georgia males were grandsons of veterans or owned the required property, the exemption and the property requirement basically allowed only well-to-do whites to vote. The qualifications of good character, citizenship knowledge, literacy (all determined subjectively by white registrars), and property ownership were used to disqualify most blacks and poor whites, preventing them from registering to vote. The voter rolls dropped dramatically.<ref name="auto1"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Georgia's 1908 Disfranchisement Constitutional Amendment|url=https://raycityhistory.wordpress.com/tag/georgias-1908-disfranchisement-constitutional-amendment/|website=Ray City History|publisher=Ray City Community Library|access-date=May 18, 2016|archive-date=October 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012171952/https://raycityhistory.wordpress.com/tag/georgias-1908-disfranchisement-constitutional-amendment/|url-status=live}}</ref> In the early 20th century, [[Progressivism|Progressives]] promoted electoral reform and reducing the power of ward bosses to clean up politics.

Legal segregation was ended by passage of federal legislation in the 1960s. According to the 1960 census, the proportion of Georgia's population that was African American was 28%; hundreds of thousands of blacks had left the state in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to the North and Midwest. New white residents arrived through migration and immigration. Following support from the national Democratic Party for the civil rights movement and especially civil rights legislation of 1964 and 1965, most African-American voters, as well as other minority voters, have largely supported the Democratic Party in Georgia.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ajc.com/news/white-voters-solidly-for-gop-georgia/3tKH7yW7hZloI8QwqY5ocJ/ |title=White voters solidly in for GOP in Georgia (October 16, 2012) |publisher=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=October 16, 2012 |access-date=June 4, 2021 |archive-date=June 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210604192313/https://www.ajc.com/news/white-voters-solidly-for-gop-georgia/3tKH7yW7hZloI8QwqY5ocJ/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2002, incumbent moderate Democratic Governor [[Roy Barnes]] was defeated by Republican [[Sonny Perdue]], a state legislator and former Democrat. While Democrats retained control of the State House, they lost their majority in the Senate when four Democrats switched parties. They lost the House in the 2004 election. Republicans then controlled all three partisan elements of the state government.

Even before 2002, the state had become increasingly supportive of Republicans in Presidential elections. It has supported a Democrat for president only four times since 1960. In 1976 and 1980, native son [[Jimmy Carter]] carried the state; in 1992, the former Arkansas governor [[Bill Clinton]] narrowly won the state; and in 2020, [[Joe Biden]] narrowly carried the state. Generally, Republicans were strongest in the predominantly white suburban (especially the Atlanta suburbs) and rural portions of the state.<ref name="CNN.com: Election 2004">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004//pages/results/states/GA/P/00/epolls.0.html |title=Election 2004 |publisher=CNN |access-date=October 24, 2010 |archive-date=October 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024041646/http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004//pages/results/states/GA/P/00/epolls.0.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Many of these areas were represented by conservative Democrats in the state legislature well into the 21st century. One of the most conservative of these was U.S. Congressman [[Larry McDonald]], former head of the [[John Birch Society]], who died when the [[Soviet Union]] shot down [[KAL 007]] near [[Sakhalin Island]]. Democratic candidates have tended to win a higher percentage of the vote in the areas where black voters are most numerous,<ref name="CNN.com: Election 2004"/> as well as in the cities among liberal urban populations (especially Atlanta and Athens), and the central and southwestern portion of the state.

The ascendancy of the Republican Party in Georgia and in the South in general resulted in Georgia [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] member [[Newt Gingrich]] being elected as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] following the election of a Republican majority in the House in 1994. Gingrich served as Speaker until 1999, when he resigned in the aftermath of the loss of House seats held by members of the GOP. Gingrich mounted an unsuccessful bid for president in the 2012 election, but withdrew after winning only the South Carolina and Georgia primaries.

In 2008, Democrat [[Jim Martin (Georgia politician)|Jim Martin]] ran against incumbent Republican Senator [[Saxby Chambliss]]. Chambliss failed to acquire the necessary 50 percent of votes due to a Libertarian Party candidate receiving the remainder of votes. In the [[runoff election]] held on December 2, 2008, Chambliss became the second Georgia Republican to be reelected to the U.S. Senate.

In the 2018 elections, the [[List of Governors of Georgia|governorship]] remained under control by a Republican (by 54,723 votes against a Democrat, [[Stacey Abrams]]), Republicans lost eight seats in the [[Georgia House of Representatives]] (winning 106), while Democrats gained ten (winning 74), Republicans lost two seats in the [[Georgia State Senate|Georgia Senate]] (winning 35 seats), while Democrats gained two seats (winning 21), and five Democrat [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] were elected with Republicans winning nine seats (one winning with just 419 votes over the Democratic challenger, and one seat being lost).<ref>{{cite news |title=Georgia Election Results |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/election-results/georgia/ |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=January 27, 2019 |archive-date=February 8, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190208205411/https://www.washingtonpost.com/election-results/georgia/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Georgia House of Representatives elections, 2018 |url=https://ballotpedia.org/Georgia_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2018 |website=ballotpedia.org |publisher=Ballotpedia |access-date=January 27, 2019 |archive-date=November 7, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107081615/https://ballotpedia.org/Georgia_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Georgia State Senate elections, 2018 |url=https://ballotpedia.org/Georgia_State_Senate_elections,_2018 |website=ballotpedia.org |publisher=Ballotpedia |access-date=January 27, 2019 |archive-date=November 7, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107080248/https://ballotpedia.org/Georgia_State_Senate_elections,_2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the three presidential elections up to and including 2016, the Republican candidate has won Georgia by approximately five to eight points over the Democratic nominee, at least once for each election being narrower than margins recorded in some states that have flipped within that timeframe, such as [[United States presidential elections in Michigan|Michigan]], [[United States presidential elections in Ohio|Ohio]] and [[United States presidential elections in Wisconsin|Wisconsin]]. This trend led to the state narrowly electing Democrat [[Joe Biden]] for president in 2020, and it coming to be regarded as a [[swing state]].<ref name=biden1>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/19/joe-biden-president-georgia-recount|title=Joe Biden confirmed as Georgia winner after recount|work=The Guardian|access-date=January 7, 2021|date=November 20, 2020|archive-date=October 6, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211006180247/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/19/joe-biden-president-georgia-recount|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=swing>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2020/11/08/georgia-swing-state-democrats/?arc404=true|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|title=How Georgia became a swing state for the first time in decades|access-date=January 7, 2021|date=November 8, 2020|archive-date=March 13, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210313054614/https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2020/11/08/georgia-swing-state-democrats/?arc404=true|url-status=live}}</ref>

{{Main|Politics of Georgia (U.S. state)}}

During the 1960s and 1970s, Georgia made significant changes in civil rights and governance. As in many other states, its legislature had not reapportioned congressional districts according to population from 1931 to after the 1960 census. Problems of malapportionment in the state legislature, where rural districts had outsize power in relation to urban districts, such as Atlanta's, were corrected after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Wesberry v. Sanders]]'' (1964). The court ruled that congressional districts had to be reapportioned to have essentially equal populations.

A related case, ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), required state legislatures to end their use of geographical districts or counties in favor of "one man, one vote"; that is, districts based upon approximately equal populations, to be reviewed and changed as necessary after each census. These changes resulted in residents of Atlanta and other urban areas gaining political power in Georgia in proportion to their populations.<ref name="epstein">[https://books.google.com/books?id=CmPKNI2z5-AC&q=Was+Georgia+dominated+by+rural+districts%3F+Apportionment%3F&pg=PA753 Lee Epstein, Thomas G.

Economic growth through this period was dominated by Atlanta and its region. It was a bedrock of the emerging "[[New South]]". From the late 20th century, Atlanta attracted headquarters and relocated workers of national companies, becoming more diverse, liberal and cosmopolitan than many areas of the state.

In the 21st century, many conservative Democrats, including former U.S. Senator and governor [[Zell Miller]], decided to support Republicans. The state's then-socially conservative bent resulted in wide support for measures such as restrictions on abortion. In 2004, a state constitutional amendment banning [[same-sex marriage]]s was approved by 76% of voters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Georgia_Constitutional_Amendment_1_%282004%29 |title=Georgia Marriage Amendment, Question 1 (2004) |publisher=Ballotpedia |access-date=May 22, 2010 |archive-date=September 30, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930081048/http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Georgia_Constitutional_Amendment_1_(2004) |url-status=live }}</ref> However, after the United States Supreme Court issued its ruling in ''[[Obergefell v.

In [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]], Georgia voted solely Democratic in every election from [[1900 United States presidential election|1900]] to [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]]. In [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]], it was one of only a handful of states to vote for Republican [[Barry Goldwater]] over Democrat [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. In [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]], it did not vote for either of the two parties, but rather the [[American Independent Party]] and its nominee, [[Alabama]] Governor [[George Wallace]]. In [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]], the state returned to Republicans as part of a landslide victory for [[Richard Nixon]]. In [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]] and [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]], it voted for Democrat and former Georgia governor [[Jimmy Carter]]. The state returned to Republicans in [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]] and [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]], before going Democratic once again in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]]. For every election between that year and [[2020 United States presidential election|2020]], Georgia voted heavily Republican, in line with many of its neighbors in the [[Deep South]]. In [[2020 United States presidential election|2020]], it voted Democratic for the first time in 28 years, aiding [[Joe Biden]] in his defeat of incumbent Republican [[Donald Trump]].

Prior to 2020, Republicans in state, federal and congressional races had seen decreasing margins of victory, and many election forecasts had ranked Georgia as a "toss-up" state, or with Biden as a very narrow favorite.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/georgia-demographic-shift-vote-democrat-republican-1.5794314|title=Georgia was reliably red.
