It is located in the northeastern part of the province, sitting at the head of [[Hangzhou Bay]], which separates [[Shanghai]] and [[Ningbo]].

As of 2022, the Hangzhou metropolitan area was estimated to produce a [[gross metropolitan product]] ([[GDP (nominal)|nominal]]) of 4 trillion yuan (US$590 billion), [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|making it larger than the economy]] of Sweden. As of the [[2020 Chinese census]], it had a total population of 11,936,010 inhabitants. However, its metropolitan area, populated by 13.035 million people over an area of {{convert|8107.9|km2|abbr=on}}, consists of all urban districts in Hangzhou and 3 urban districts of the city of [[Shaoxing]].

Hangzhou is the eighth largest GDP among cities in [[mainland China]] with a GDP of around 1.8 trillion [[Renminbi|RMB]] ($280 billion). Home to the headquarters of large global tech companies such as [[Alibaba Group]], [[Ant Group]], and [[NetEase]], Hangzhou is known for attracting professionals and entrepreneurs who work in [[information technology]]. {{as of|2023|08}}, Hangzhou has the tenth-most [[Fortune Global 500]] headquarters of any city in the world and the fourth-most in China{{snd}}after [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]] and [[Shenzhen]]{{snd}}within its city limits.  According to the 2020 Hurun Global Rich List, Hangzhou ranks 11th in the world and 6th in China (after Beijing, Shanghai, [[Hong Kong]], Shenzhen and [[Guangzhou]]) in the number of resident billionaires.

Hangzhou ranks [[List of cities by scientific output|16th]] globally by scientific outputs. It hosts [[List of universities and colleges in Zhejiang|several notable universities]], including [[Zhejiang University|Zhejiang]], [[Zhejiang University of Technology]], [[Hangzhou Normal University|Hangzhou Normal]], [[Hangzhou Dianzi University|Hangzhou Dianzi]], [[Zhejiang A & F University|Zhejiang A&F]], [[Zhejiang Sci-Tech University|Zhejiang Sci-Tech]], [[Zhejiang Chinese Medical University|Zhejiang Chinese Medical]], [[Westlake University|Westlake]], [[China Jiliang University|China Jiliang]] and [[Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics]].

Hangzhou was made the seat of the [[zhou (Chinese province)|prefecture]] of Hang in {{nowrap|AD 589}}, entitling it to a [[Chinese city wall|city wall]] which was constructed two years later. By a longstanding convention also seen in other cities like [[Guangzhou]] and [[Fuzhou]], the city took on the name of the area it administered and became known as Hangzhou. Hangzhou was at the southern end of China's [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] which extends to Beijing. The canal evolved over centuries but reached its full length by 609.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 114">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 114: "[...] the Grand Canal, dug between 605 and 609 by means of enormous levies of conscripted labour."</ref>

=== Tang dynasty ===
In the [[Tang dynasty]], [[Bai Juyi]], a renowned poet, was appointed governor of Hangzhou.<ref name="Waley 1941, 131">Waley (1941), 131</ref> He noticed that the farmland nearby depended on the water of [[West Lake]], but due to negligence the old [[dike (construction)|dyke]] had collapsed, and the lake so dried out that the local farmers were suffering from severe [[drought]]. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dyke, with a [[dam]] to control the flow of water, mitigating the drought problem. The livelihood of local people of Hangzhou improved over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the West Lake, visiting it almost daily. He then had willows and other trees planted along the dyke, making it a landmark.

Once the prospect of retaking northern China had diminished, buildings in Hangzhou were extended and renovated to become a permanent imperial capital.

From 1132 until the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasion of 1276, Hangzhou remained the capital of the Southern Song dynasty and was known as '''Lin'an''' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|臨安}}}}). It served as the seat of the imperial government, a center of trade and entertainment, and the nexus of the main branches of the [[civil service]]. During that time the city was a gravitational center of Chinese civilization as what used to be considered "central China" in the north was taken by the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]], an ethnic minority dynasty ruled by [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]].

Numerous philosophers, politicians, and men of literature, including some of the most celebrated poets in Chinese history such as [[Su Shi]], [[Lu You]], and [[Xin Qiji]] came here to live and die. Hangzhou is also the birthplace and final resting place of the scientist [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095 AD), his tomb being located in the [[Yuhang]] district.<ref name="Yuhang">Yuhang Cultural Network (October 2003).

During the Southern Song dynasty, commercial expansion, an influx of refugees from the conquered north, and the growth of the official and military establishments, led to a corresponding population increase and the city developed well outside its 9th-century ramparts. According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', Hangzhou had a population of over 2 million at that time, while historian [[Jacques Gernet]] has estimated that the population of Hangzhou numbered well over one million by 1276. (Official Chinese census figures from the year 1270 listed some 186,330 families in residence and probably failed to count non-residents and soldiers.) It is believed that Hangzhou was the largest city in the world from 1180 to 1315 and from 1348 to 1358.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm|title=Largest Cities Through History|website=Geography.about.com|date=2011-03-02|access-date=2011-03-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010218202126/http://geography.about.com/science/geography/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm|archive-date=February 18, 2001|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>Janet L.

Because of the large population and densely crowded (often multi-story) wooden buildings, Hangzhou was particularly vulnerable to fires. Major conflagrations destroyed large sections of the city in 1208, 1229, 1237, and 1275. The 1237 fire alone destroyed 30,000 dwellings. However, the worst was the 1208 fire which burned for 4 days in a 3-mile diameter and burnt 58,097 houses as well as killing 59 people. To combat this threat, the city constructed storage buildings that were rented out to merchants where watchmen patrolled by night and was enclosed by water on all sides.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Gernet |first=Jacques |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k5xpXOYxxEEC |title=Daily life in China, on the eve of the Mongol invasion, 1250-1276 |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=1959 |isbn=9780804707206 |location=Stanford, California |pages=26, 37}}</ref> Besides this, the government established an elaborate system for fighting fires, erected watchtowers, devised a system of lantern and flag signals to identify the source of the flames and direct the response, and charged more than 3,000 soldiers with the task of putting out fire.

Hangzhou was besieged and captured by the advancing [[Mongol]] armies of [[Kublai Khan]] in 1276, three years before the final collapse of the Southern Song.<ref name="gernet 15">Gernet, 15.</ref> Historian [[Patricia Buckley Ebrey]] noted that the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] killed the Jurchen Wanyan royal family by the hundreds in the [[Mongol siege of Kaifeng]], while sparing the city of Hangzhou including the Chinese Zhao royal family of the [[Song dynasty|Southern Song]].

===Modern history===
[[File:Hangzhou CBD (Cropped).jpg|thumb|Hangzhou CBD]]

The city remained an important port until the middle of the [[Ming dynasty]] era, when its harbor slowly [[silt]]ed up. Under the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], it was the site of an [[Qing Army|imperial army]] garrison.<ref>{{citation |last=Cassel |first=Pär |contribution=Excavating Extraterritoriality: The "Judicial Sub-Prefect" as a Prototype for the Mixed Court in Shanghai |title=Late Imperial China |volume=24 |date=2003 |issue=2 |pages=156–182 }}.</ref>

In 1856 and 1860, the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] occupied Hangzhou. The city was heavily damaged during its conquest, occupation, and eventual reconquest by the Qing army.

Hangzhou was ruled by the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] government under the [[Kuomintang]] from 1927 to 1937. From 1937 to 1945, the city was occupied by [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japan]]. The Kuomintang returned in 1945, and governed until 1949. On May 3, 1949, the [[People's Liberation Army]] entered Hangzhou and the city came under [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) control. After [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s reformist policies began in the end of 1978, Hangzhou took advantage of being situated in the [[Yangtze Delta]] to bolster its development. It is now one of China's most prosperous major cities.

During the [[Cultural Revolution]], Hangzhou was stage to a series of labor unrest and factional fighting known as the [[Hangzhou incident (1975)|Hangzhou incident]].

Hangzhou was the third city in China to host the [[2022 Asian Games|Asian Games]] after [[1990 Asian Games|Beijing 1990]] and [[2010 Asian Games|Guangzhou 2010]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-09/16/c_134629438.htm|title=Hangzhou of China selected to host 2022 Asian Games|date=2015-09-16|publisher=Xinhua|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125223857/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-09/16/c_134629438.htm|archive-date=November 25, 2015|access-date=2015-09-16|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It also hosted the [[2016 G20 Hangzhou summit|eleventh G20 summit]] in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/world/2015-11/17/content_37080816.htm|title=China to host 2016 G20 summit in Hangzhou|year=2015|publisher=PRC Central Government Official Website|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118181746/http://www.china.org.cn/world/2015-11/17/content_37080816.htm|archive-date=November 18, 2015|access-date=2015-12-20|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Hangzhou is located in northwestern Zhejiang province, at the southern end of the [[Grand Canal of China]], which runs to [[Beijing]], in the south-central portion of the [[Yangtze River Delta]]. Its administrative area (sub-provincial city) extends west to the mountainous parts of [[Anhui]] province, and east to the coastal plain near [[Hangzhou Bay]].<ref name=":04" />{{Rp|page=86}} The city center is built around the eastern and northern sides of the West Lake, just north of the [[Qiantang River]].<ref name=":04" />{{Rp|page=86}}

The [[Qiantang River]] is the largest river in Zhejiang Province, China. Every year during August 15 to August 18 of the lunar month in China, the Qiantang Tide occurs. It is called "the Biggest Tide in the World". The world's largest [[tidal bore]] races up the Qiantang River through Hangzhou reaching up to {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height.

===Cycle hire===
[[Bicycle]]s and [[Motorized bicycle|electric scooters]] are very popular, and major streets have dedicated bike lanes throughout the city. Hangzhou has an extensive  [[Bicycle sharing system|public bike rental system]] called the [[Hangzhou Public Bicycle]] system. There is a dock-and-station system like those of Paris or London and users can hire bicycles with IC card or mobile phone application. Journeys within 60 minutes are free of charge.

===Railways===

Hangzhou sits on the intersecting point of some of the busiest rail corridors in China. The city's main station is [[Hangzhou East railway station|Hangzhou East station]] (colloquially "East Station" {{lang|zh-hans|东站}}). It is one of the biggest rail traffic hubs in China, consisting of 15 platforms that house the High Speed services to Shanghai, Nanjing, Changsha, Ningbo, and beyond. The metro station beneath the rail complex building is a stop along the Hangzhou Metro Line 1 and Line 4. There are frequent departures for [[Shanghai]] with approximately 20-minute headways from 6:00 to 21:00. Non-stop CRH high-speed service between Hangzhou and Shanghai takes 50 minutes and leaves every hour (excluding a few early morning/late night departures) from both directions. Other [[China Railway High-speed|CRH]] high-speed trains that stop at one or more stations along the route complete the trip in 59 to 75 minutes. Most other major cities in China can also be reached by direct train service from Hangzhou. The [[Hangzhou railway station]] (colloquially the "City Station" {{zh|c=城站|links=no}}) was closed for renovation in mid 2013 but has recently opened again.

A second high-speed rail channel through Hangzhou is operational along with another major station, [[Hangzhou West railway station|Hangzhou West]], opened on September 22, 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |title=杭州西站开通运营-新华网 |url=http://m.news.cn/2022-09/22/c_1129022727.htm |access-date=2022-09-22 |website=m.news.cn}}</ref>

Direct trains link Hangzhou with more than 50 main cities, including 12 daily services to [[Beijing]] and more than 100 daily services to [[Shanghai]]; they reach as far as [[Ürümqi]]. The [[China Railway High-Speed]] service inaugurated on October 26, 2010. The service is operated by the CRH 380A(L), CRH 380B(L) and CRH380CL train sets which travel at a maximum speed of {{convert|350|km/h|abbr=on}}, shortening the duration of the {{convert|202|km|abbr=on}} trip to only 45 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-10/26/c_13575584.htm|author=[[xinhuanet]]|title=China unveils Shanghai-Hangzhou high-speed railway; eyes network extension|date=2010-10-26|access-date=2010-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029002208/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-10/26/c_13575584.htm|archive-date=October 29, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

== Ancient proverbs about Hangzhou ==
An ancient Chinese proverb about Hangzhou and Suzhou is:

<blockquote>There is Heaven above, and Suzhou and Hangzhou below. ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|上有天堂，下有苏杭}})</blockquote>

This phrase has a similar meaning to the English phrases "Heaven on Earth". [[Marco Polo]] in his accounts described Suzhou as "the city of the earth" while Hangzhou is "the city of heaven".<ref>{{citation|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/marcopolo00polouoft#page/288/mode/2up|author=J.M. Dent|title=The travels of Marco Polo the Venetian|chapter=Chapter LXVIII: On the Noble and Magnificent City of Kin-Sai|year=1908|page=289|access-date=October 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402140626/http://archive.org/stream/marcopolo00polouoft#page/288/mode/2up|archive-date=April 2, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>  The city presented itself as "Paradise on Earth" during the [[2016 G20 Hangzhou summit|G20 summit]] held in the city in 2016.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://time.com/4477547/g20-summit-china-hangzhou-environment/ |title= China's Hanghzou Clears Out Pests—and People—as It Prepares to Host the G20 Summit |author= Hannah Beech |date= September 2, 2016 |access-date= October 16, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161017005023/http://time.com/4477547/g20-summit-china-hangzhou-environment/ |archive-date= October 17, 2016 |url-status= live |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

Another saying about Hangzhou is:

<blockquote>Be born in [[Suzhou]], live in Hangzhou, eat in [[Guangzhou]], die in [[Liuzhou]]. ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|生在苏州，活在杭州，吃在广州，死在柳州}})</blockquote>

The meaning here lies in the fact that Suzhou was renowned for its beautiful and highly civilized and educated citizens, Hangzhou for its scenery, Guangzhou for its food, and Liuzhou (of [[Guangxi]]) for its wooden coffins which supposedly halted the decay of the body (likely made from the [[Cinnamomum camphora|camphor tree]]).
