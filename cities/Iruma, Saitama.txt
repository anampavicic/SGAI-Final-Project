==History==
The area around Iruma was part of ancient [[Musashi Province]] and was noted for kilns producing [[Sue ware]] pottery in the [[Nara period]] and [[Heian period]]. During the [[Edo period]], the area developed as a series of three [[shukuba|post town]]s on the [[Nikkō Wakiōkan]] highway during the [[Edo period]]. The town of Toyooka and villages of Kaneko, Miyadera, Fujisawa and Higashikaneko were created within [[Iruma District, Saitama]] with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. The [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Academy]] established an airfield in the area in 1938, which later developed into [[Iruma Air Base]].  On April 1, 1954, Higashikaneko became Seibu Town. On September 30, 1956, Toyooka, Kaneko, Miyadera, Fujisawa and Seibu merged to form the town of Musashi. Musashi was elevated to city status on November 1, 1966, becoming the city of Iruma. Discussions to merge with the neighboring city of Sayama in 2005 failed to pass a referendum. In 2017 Japan became the first country ever to elect an openly [[transgender man]] to any public office when [[Tomoya Hosoda]] was elected as a councillor for the city of Iruma.<ref>{{cite web|author=Chloe Farand |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/japan-first-world-transgender-man-public-office-councillor-iruma-saitama-kanto-a7636641.html |title=Japan becomes first country in the world to elect a transgender man to a public office |publisher=The Independent |access-date=2017-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/03/17/japan-just-elected-its-first-trans-man-into-public-office/ |title=Japan just elected its first trans man into public office · PinkNews |publisher=Pinknews.co.uk |access-date=2017-03-18}}</ref>
