'''Carapicuíba''' ({{IPA|pt|kaɾapikuˈibɐ}}) is a [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] in Brazil. It is part of the [[Metropolitan Region of São Paulo]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://governo-sp.jusbrasil.com.br/legislacao/1028148/lei-complementar-1139-11 |title=Lei Complementar nº 1.139, de 16 de junho de 2011 |access-date=September 30, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001191247/http://governo-sp.jusbrasil.com.br/legislacao/1028148/lei-complementar-1139-11 |archive-date=October 1, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The population is 403,183 (2020 est.) in an area of {{convert|34.55|km2}}.<ref name=ibge>[https://archive.today/20150909083744/http://cod.ibge.gov.br/232I2 Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística]</ref> It is one of the most densely populated municipalities in the state of São Paulo.

== History ==
Before the first white man arrived, the region which today is Carapicuíba was inhabited by indigenous people. The hamlet was founded by [[José de Anchieta]]. [[Afonso Sardinha]] settled there with his farm with the will to [[Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|use the indigenous people as a workforce]]. He then built a chapel. The indigenous people soon reacted to the European occupation, and rushed into the jungle. By the 17th century, it was part of the recently created municipality of [[Santana do Parnaíba]]. Nothing much has changed in the hamlet during this century and most of the 18th century.

From 1770 on, however, the city and its surroundings started to change noticeably, as new villages were settled, like [[Embu das Artes|Embu]] and [[Cotia]]. Houses were built around the main chapel, in which several "entrepreneur" (actually, people who arranged the parties with [[Brazilian mythology|folklore]]-related themes) lived.

Until the [[Sorocabana Railway]] was implemented, in 1870, little was developed in the village. However, when a station was opened near the section of the tracks that run through the city, many people started to live in the city. During the first half of the 20th century, agriculture started to play a role in the economy of the village, because of the climate and quality of the land. A bus line starting in [[Barueri]], running through Carapicuíba, [[Osasco]] and ending in [[Pinheiros (district of São Paulo)|Pinheiros]] was created to take people to São Paulo in alternate itineraries.

In 1948, Carapicuíba became a district of [[Cotia]], when it became independent from [[São Paulo]]. A year later, it became part of [[Barueri]], also as a district.

In 1952 the Parish Nossa Senhora Aparecida was built, and is now known as "Igreja Amarela" (''Yellow Church''), and the city population kept on increasing. The post-war times saw the vertiginous decrease of the [[prospecting]] in Minas Gerais, which led a large number of people to go to São Paulo state, a number of them settling in the city.

In the early 1960s, a movement in favor of the independence of Carapicuíba was led by the mayor of Barueri, Carlos Capriotti, and the district earned its city status in March 1965

In 2007-2008, the city gained national attention due to the [[Paturis Park murders]].

=== Origin of the name ===
According to Professor [[Eduardo de Almeida Navarro]], titular professor at the [[Faculdade de Filosofia, Letras e Ciências Humanas]] of [[University of São Paulo]], the name has a controversial origin and may come from the [[Tupi language|Tupi]] or the [[Paulista General Language]] and may have different significations:
* "[[peziza]] (a fungus that is) inappropriate (to be eaten)" (''karapuku'', peziza + ''aíb'', inappropriate + ''a'', [[suffix]])<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Dicionário Tupi Antigo - a Língua Índigena Clássica do Brasil|last=NAVARRO|first=Eduardo de Almeida|author-link=Eduardo de Almeida Navarro|publisher=Global Editora|year=2013|isbn=978-8526019331|location=São Paulo|pages=555|language=pt}}</ref>
* "[[Eucinostomus gula|carapicus]] (a fish) rotten (inappropriate to be eaten)" (''akará'', [[acará]] + ''puku'', long + ''aíb'', rotten + ''a'', suffix)<ref name=":0" />
* "[[Urena sinuata|carapicu]] tree (a kind of [[shrub]])" (''carapicu'', carapicu + ' ''yba'', tree)<ref name=":0" />
Some people say that it may also come from ''Quar-I-Picui-Bae'', name given by Indians to a small river delimiting a border between the city with [[Osasco]] and [[Cotia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encontracarapicuiba.com.br/carapicuiba/historia-de-carapicuiba.shtml|title=História de Carapicuíba, História da cidade de Carapicuíba, Cidade Carapicuíba - São Paulo|website=www.encontracarapicuiba.com.br|language=pt|access-date=2016-10-23}}</ref>

== Geography ==
The border with Barueri is a large plain formed by the side of the [[Rio Tietê]]. The exploration of [[sand]] in the area was so intensive that a large crater was formed. However, during the 1960s, the government of São Paulo state started a series of works to alter the route of the river, and the destruction of the wall between the river and the crater led to the flooding of it. Now, the place has become an artificial lake called "Lagoa de Carapicuíba" (''Carapicuíba Lake''). 8 thousand litres of sewage from the central, western and southern portions of the city of São Paulo pass through the lake towards Barueri. The average altitude is 717 meters and the climate is in general a [[humid subtropical climate]].

== Economy ==
{{Expand section|date=January 2009}}
As of 2005, the city has a GDP of [[Brazilian real|R$]]1,915,285,000.00 and a GDP per capita of R$5,004<ref>[http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/economia/pibmunicipios/2005/tab01.pdf IBGE – GDP and GDP per capita of the municipalities (2002–2005)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002024524/http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/economia/pibmunicipios/2005/tab01.pdf |date=October 2, 2008 }}</ref>

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by [[:pt:Companhia_Telefônica_Brasileira|Companhia Telefônica Brasileira]] until 1973, when it began to be served by [[:pt:Telecomunicações_de_São_Paulo|Telecomunicações de São Paulo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imprensaoficial.com.br/DO/BuscaDO2001Documento_11_4.aspx?link=/1973/ineditoriais/abril/24/p1/pag_0054_DUI6O3SN7V5CNe7E7ANSRTTG04F.pdf&pagina=54&data=24/04/1973&caderno=Ineditoriais&paginaordenacao=100054|title=Creation of Telesp - April 12, 1973|access-date=2024-05-26|website=www.imprensaoficial.com.br|language=Portuguese}}</ref> In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the [[Vivo (telecommunications company)|Vivo]] brand in 2012.<ref name=":vivo" />

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).<ref name=":vivo">{{Cite web|url=https://ri.telefonica.com.br/en/the-company/our-history/|title=Our History - Telefônica RI|access-date=2024-05-26|website=Telefônica}}</ref>

== Transportation ==
[[File:Obras do Terminal Rodoviário de Carapicuíba (44355792074).jpg|thumb|right|Carapicuíba Bus Terminal under construction as of October 2018.]]
The city is served by the [[Line 8 (CPTM)|Line 8]] of [[CPTM|São Paulo commuter rail]], having two stations within the area of the municipality and a third one just after the border with Osasco. Three Bus services serve the city: [[ETT Carapicuíba]] and [[Del Rey Transportes]], with municipal and inter municipal lines, and [[Viação Osasco]], with intermunicipal lines only.

=== Highways ===
There are no highways crossing Carapicuíba, though the [[Rodoanel Mário Covas]] marks most of the border with Osasco and provides some accesses to the city, as well as serving as the main connection to the other highways and the city of São Paulo itself. The [[Rodovia Castelo Branco]] passes just north of the city, in Barueri. It is also possible to access Carapicuíba from the [[Rodovia Raposo Tavares]], which runs just south of it in the city of [[Cotia]], and from [[Osasco]] via the Avenida dos Autonomistas.
