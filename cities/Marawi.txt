On May 23, 2017, the city suffered extensive damage during the [[Siege of Marawi]] as militants affiliated with the [[Islamic State]] invaded the city and engaged in a five-month [[urban warfare]],<ref>{{Cite web |date=November 17, 2017 |title=Philippines: 'Battle of Marawi' Leaves Trail of Death and Destruction |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2017/11/philippines-battle-of-marawi-leaves-trail-of-death-and-destruction/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210930095340/https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2017/11/philippines-battle-of-marawi-leaves-trail-of-death-and-destruction/ |archive-date=September 30, 2021 |access-date=September 30, 2021 |website=Amnesty International |language=en}}</ref> until when Defense Secretary [[Delfin Lorenzana]] announced the ending of the battle in October.

==Etymology==
''Dansalan'' (Marawi's prior name) derived from the [[Mëranaw]] word "dansal", which means rendezvous; literally, it also means arrival<ref name="ICoMsG" /> (in other source,<ref name="ANC19" /> "where the waves come to shore"). Being known as the destination point for arriving boats,<ref name="ANC19" /> the place refers to a port,<ref name="tMT0319" /> hence, the "Place of Destination and Purpose."<ref name="tPS&CoA" />

Meanwhile, ''Marawi'' is derived from the word "rawi", which means reclining, in reference to [[Agus River]].<ref name="ICoMsG" /> On the other hand, this present name is in honor of the city's martyred hero in Kuta Maraghui (Fortress of Marawi) in 1895.<ref name="ANC19" />

'''Dansalan''' began as a port.<ref name="ANC19" /> A sovereign of Marawi before 1639 was "Datu Buadi Sa Kayo" who imposed taxation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2021}}

Around the original Meranaw fortification, Spanish captain Francisco Atienza founded a settlement called ''Dansalan'' in October 1639. His forces had come from [[Iligan]] and were attempting to conquer the entire Lake Lanao area. However, it was abandoned later the same year when thousands of Meranaw soldiers [[investment (military)|invested]] the then-fortifying settlement, pressing the Spaniards hard and thus they returned to Iligan, having failed in their quest.<ref name="tMT0319">{{Cite web |last=Custodio |first=Arlo |date=March 25, 2019 |title=Marawi City as an Exponent of Maranao Culture |url=https://www.manilatimes.net/2019/03/25/supplements/marawi-city-as-an-exponent-of-maranao-culture/530567 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210930093850/https://www.manilatimes.net/2019/03/25/supplements/marawi-city-as-an-exponent-of-maranao-culture/530567 |archive-date=September 30, 2021 |access-date=September 30, 2021 |website=The Manila Times |language=en}}</ref>

===Topography===
Mountains, rolling hills, valleys, and a large placid lake dominate the city's landscape. Angoyao Hills ([[Barangay]] Sogod) served as natural viewpoint over the water of the Lake Lanao. Signal Hill (Barangay Matampay), Arumpac Hill (Barangay Saduc), and Mt. Mupo (Barangay Guimba) are considered beautiful but mysterious. Mt. Mupo, located within the [[Sacred Mountain National Park]], is known for its untouched trees and beautiful, perfect cone.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}
