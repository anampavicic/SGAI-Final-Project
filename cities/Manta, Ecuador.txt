'''Manta''', also known as '''San Pablo de Manta''', is a city in [[Ecuador]], cantonal head of the Manta Canton, as well as the largest and most populated city in the [[Manabí Province]].

Located on the Pacific coast, Manta has the largest seaport in Ecuador.

From Manta, Condamine started his trip inland towards [[Quito]].

Manta has an international airport, [[Eloy Alfaro International Airport]], with passenger airline service, and an important military base (known as [[Manta Air Base]] or Eloy Alfaro Air Base). Between 1999-2009 Manta Air Base was used by U.S. air forces to support anti-narcotics military operations and surveillance flights against Colombian drug trafficking cartels. The lease was not renewed by the Ecuadorian government.

Manta is recognized for its international film festival, featuring groups from different places in the world. The Ecuadorian actor [[Carlos Valencia (actor)|Carlos Valencia]] was invited to [[Cannes Film Festival]] for his performance in ''Ratas Ratones y Rateros'' (1999), directed by [[Sebastián Cordero]].
