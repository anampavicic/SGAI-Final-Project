==History==
The ancient town of [[Heraclea Cybistra]] (Ηράκλεια Κυβίστρα in [[Ancient Greek]]) was located here, and gave its name ([[Heracles]]) to the modern town. The town had some importance in [[Hellenistic]] times owing to its position near the point where the road to the [[Gülek Pass]] (Cilician Gates) enters the hills. It lay in the way of armies and was more than once sacked by the [[Arab]] invaders of [[Asia Minor]] (AD 805 and 832). During the [[Crusade of 1101]] it was the scene of a failed battle of 15,000 men led by [[William II, Count of Nevers]] against the [[Seljuks]], which left the [[Crusaders]] weak en route to [[Antioch]].<ref>{{cite book

Ereğli is also known for being the first capital of the [[Beylik of Karaman|Karaman Beylik]] founded by Nur Sufi Bey.  The Karaman state was renowned for being a consistent nuisance to [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman dominance]] in Anatolia, being one of the few [[Anatolian beyliks]] to retain sovereignty well past [[Mehmed the Conqueror]]'s [[Fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]].  It was also the first political entity and beylik in [[Anatolia]] to proclaim [[Old Anatolian Turkish|Turkish]] as an official language alongside [[Arabic]] and [[Farsi|Persian]]. In 1553, upon return from a campaign in Persia, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] had his son, [[Şehzade Mustafa]], killed in the Ereğli valley where the [[Ottoman Army]] was stationed. Modern Ereğli had grown from a large village to a town since the railway reached it from [[Konya]] and [[Karaman]] in 1904; and it has now hotels and thriving businesses.

== Archaeology ==

Three hours’ ride south is the famous "[[Hittites|Hittite]]" [[rock relief]] of a [[lynx]], representing a king (probably of neighbouring [[Tyana]]) adoring a god. This was the first "Hittite" monument discovered in modern times (early 18th century, by the Swede Otter, an emissary of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]).

Ereğli may be the location of the Hittite town of Hupisna ([[Cybistra|Ḫupišna]]), where the goddess [[Ḫuwaššanna]] was worshipped. She was linked with [[Gazbaba]], a [[Mesopotamian goddess|Mesopotamian love goddess]] also connected with [[Inanna]].

In the early [[Iron Age]], Hupisna also was a neo-Hittite polity in the land of [[Tabal (state)|Tabal]]. Two kings of Hupisna are known from the Assyrian sources: Puḫamme (c. 837 BC) and Urimme (c. 738 BC).<ref>Trevor Bryce: ''The World of the Neo-Hittite Kingdoms; A Political and Military History.''
