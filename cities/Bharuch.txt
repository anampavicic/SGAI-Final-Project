'''Bharuch''' ({{audio|Bharuch.ogg|listen}}), formerly known as '''Bharutkutccha''',{{efn|The name is also sometimes given as '''Parocco'''.<ref>{{citation |last=Neill |first=Stephen |author-mask=Neill |title=A History of Christianity in India |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RH4VPgB__GQC&pg=PA73 73]}}</ref>}} is a city at the mouth of the river [[Narmada]] in [[Gujarat]] in western India. Bharuch is the administrative headquarters of [[Bharuch District]].

The city of Bharuch and surroundings have been settled since times of antiquity. It was a ship building centre and [[sea port]] in the [[compass|pre-compass]] coastal trading routes for trading with the Occident and the East, perhaps as far back as the days of earliest trade connections. The route made use of the regular and predictable [[monsoon]] winds or [[galley]]s. Many goods from the Far East and Far West (the famed [[Spice trade|Spices]] and [[Silk Road|Silk]] trade) were shipped there during the annual monsoon winds, making it a terminus for several key land-sea [[trade routes]]. Bharuch was known to the Greeks, the [[Parthian Empire]], in the [[Roman Empire]], the Chinese, and in other Western and Eastern centres of civilisation through the end of the European [[Middle Ages]] and other the middle ages of the world.<ref name="Periplus of the Erythraean Sea">[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]</ref><ref name="depts.washington.edu">[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/periplus/map/periplus_map.html Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]. Depts.washington.edu. Retrieved on 28 July 2013.</ref>

Bharuch has been the home to the Gujarati Bhargava Brahmana community for ages. The community traces its lineage to [[Bhrigu]] and [[Parashurama]], who is the sixth avatara of [[Vishnu]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Munśī|first=Dhanaprasād Candālāl|title=Bhārgava brāhmaṇo-no itihās (History of the Bhargava Brahmins)|publisher=Navlakhī Printing Press, Kālbādevī|year=1929|isbn=|location=Mumbai|pages=}}</ref> The Bharava community still administers a large number of public trusts in the city. However the present day Bhargava Brahmanas have migrated to [[Mumbai]], [[Surat]], [[Vadodara]], [[Ahmedabad]] and other countries such as France, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.

Being close to one of the biggest industrial areas including [[Ankleshwar|Ankleshvara]] GIDC, it is at times referred to as the chemical capital of India. The city has chemical plants, textile mills, long staple cotton, dairy products and much more. Gujarat's biggest liquid cargo terminal is situated 50&nbsp;km to the west of Bharuch, in Dahej.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Dahej Port, Gujarat|url=https://www.adaniports.com/Ports-and-Terminals/Dahej-Port|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190729114954/https://www.adaniports.com/Ports-and-Terminals/Dahej-Port |archive-date=29 July 2019 |access-date=5 January 2021|website=Dahej Port, Gujarat}}</ref> It also houses many multinational companies, such as [[Videocon]], [[BASF]], [[ONGC Petro-Additions]], [[Reliance Industries]], [[Adani Ports & SEZ]], [[Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilisers & Chemicals]], [[MRF (company)|MRF]] Tires, [[Yokohama Off-Highway Tires]], [[Jubilant FoodWorks|Jubilant]], Aditya Birla [[Hindalco Industries]], [[Gujarat Fluorochemicals Limited]], [[ISGEC]] Hitachi, [[UPL (company)]], [[Gujarat Alkalies and Chemicals Limited]], [[Deepak Nitrite]], [[Torrent Pharmaceuticals]], [[Petronet LNG]], [[Godrej & Boyce]], [[Piramal Group]], [[Pidilite Industries]], [[SRF Limited]], Safari Equipments<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.safariequipments.co.in/ |title=Home |website=safariequipments.co.in}}</ref> and [[Welspun Maxsteel Ltd]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The industrial estate of Vilayata houses the companies of Aditya Birla [[Grasim]], [[Kansai Nerolac Paints]] etc., Jhagadia houses DCM Sriram Chemicals,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dcmshriram.com/about-us |title=About Us |website=dcmshriram.com/ |access-date=10 February 2023}}</ref> [[Saint-Gobain]] India Ltd., [[PepsiCo]] India Holdings Ltd. among others. Because of the distinctive colour of its soil (which is also ideal for cotton cultivation), Bharuch is sometimes referred to as 'Kanam Pradesham' (black-soil land).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Bharuch is also nicknamed as 'Peanut City' for its salty peanuts, locally known as 'Khari Singh'.<ref name='"Peanut City", "Khari Sing"'>{{cite web |title=Bharuch Special Peanuts |url=http://www.kheteshwar.com/product/bharuch-special-peanuts/ |website=kheteshwar.com |publisher=SHREE KHETESHWAR SWEETS |access-date=7 January 2022}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Bharuch was known as {{transliteration|sa|Bharutkatccha }} in ancient times.<ref>{{cite book |last=Majumdar |first=M.

It was known as 'Bharuch' under Muslim times, 'Bharutkatchha' under Maratha times, and as 'Bharucha' under European times.

==Mythology==

===Hindu mythology===
[[File:Maharishi Bhrighuji.jpg|thumb|[[Bhrigu]]'s ashrama is located on the [[Narmada river|Narmada]] river's banks.]]
According to the [[Skanda Purana]], when Bhrigu Rishi came here, Bharuch was the residence of the Goddess [[Lakshmi]].

Bharuch derives its name from the great sage [[Bhrigu]]. The original name of Bharuch is 'Bhrigukachchha'. Bhrigu was one of the many children of [[Brahma]] and [[Saraswati|Sarasvati]]. There is also a story which indicates that Bhrigu along with his kin asked for temporary access to Bharuch which then belonged to [[Lakshmi]] since Bharuch is located on the banks of river [[Narmada River|Narmada]] also known as Rudra Deha. Chandramaulishvara Shiva is the [[Kuladevata]] of [[Bhargava|Bhargavas]] of Bharuch. Bhrigu never left the place and the [[Ashram|Ashrama]] of Brighu Rishi is located on the banks of Narmada.

Bharuch was considered to be sacred among [[Wise Old Man|sage]]s, and they would come to Bharuch to pray. The priests of Bharuch were famous for their learning in the other regions too. As per the mythological stories, Agnihotri and Samvedi&nbsp;– the learned priests of Bharuch&nbsp;– were famous up to [[Varanasi|Kashi]] in the northern Indian Subcontinent and the whole Indian Subcontinent.

Sages like [[Shukra]], [[Chyavana]], [[Markendeya]] and [[Jamadagni]] were from the lineage of Bhrigu. [[Parshurama]] (sixth incarnation of Lord Vishnu) was born in the seventh generation of Bhrigu.

According to the ''[[Skanda Purana]]'', there are 55 [[Tirtha (Hinduism)|tirtha]]s located in Bharuch. Many great sages, such as [[Kashyapa]], [[Kapila]], [[Mandavya]], [[Adi Sankaracharya]], have performed penances in Bharuch.

Bharuch finds its mention in major Hindu scriptures, such as ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', ''[[Shiva Purana]]'', ''[[Skanda Purana]]'', ''[[Kurma Purana]]'', ''[[Matsya Purana]]'', [[Ramayana]], ''[[Mahabharata]]'', and ''[[Kathasaritsagara]]'' and many more other Hindu Scriptures.

The [[Narmada]] is one of the Seven Holy Rivers of Hindu Indian Subcontinent; the other six being the [[Ganges|Ganga]], [[Yamuna]], [[Sarasvati River|Sarasvati]], [[Indus River|Sindhu]], [[Godavari River|Godavari]] and [[Kaveri]] and many more other rivers. It is known and said that a dip in any of these seven rivers and other rivers washes away one's sins. According to a legend, the river Ganga is polluted by millions of people bathing in it. To cleanse herself, Ganga acquires the form of a black cow and comes to the Narmada to bath in its holy waters. Legends also mention that the Narmada River is older than the river Ganga.

===Mahanubhava Pantha===

Bharuch is the Birthplace (Incarnation) of [[Chakradhar Swami|Sarvadnya Sri Chakradhara Svami]] who is, for some Hindus, the Mortal Incarnation of Vishnu. He established [[Mahanubhava|Mahanubhava Pantha]] (also known as Jai Sri Krishnyi Pantha) in Maharashtra in 1267. Bhagavan Sri Chakradhara Svami propagated a religious movement, as well as social movement, in which all members were accepted irrespective of their castes, and the traditional ritualistic religions was rejected.

===Jain mythology===

Bharuch is also a sacred [[Tirtha (Jainism)|tirtha]] for [[Jainism|Jains]].

This tirtha is situated in the Bharuch city on the rail and road path, in the Shrimali Pole. Here we see the idol of [[Munisuvrata|Munisuvrata Svami]]; black in complexion and in Padmasana posture. In the history of the Jains, this ancient city is important from many points of view. Guru Gautama Svami eulogised Muni Suvrata Svami, who is installed in Bharuch, in his "Jagachintamani Stotra" composed on the eight tirthas, Bhagavan Muni Suvrata Svami gave sermons to a horse here.

Further, many prominent Acharyas built temples and composed works in this tirtha. In Bharuch, we are shown the Ashvavabodha tirtha of the times of Muni Suvrata Svami, Shakunika Vihara of Princess Sudarshana of [[Sri Lanka]] and also the Vihara which was ceremoniously raised by Acharya Hemchandra in which Kumarapala has waved Arati; is now converted into a mosque.

In the opinion of [[Hindutvadi]] archaeologists, the Jama Masjid of the present Bharuch is "probably" this ancient temple. Some "believe" that in times of such invasions, the idol of Sri Prabhu was kept at a safe spot, and, as time passed, new temples were constructed and the old idols were installed. Today the idol is found in the new temple. There are here eleven other temples besides this.

===Buddhist mythology===

Bharuch is mentioned in various Buddhist [[Jatakas]]. It was an important [[Buddhist]] centre in the 7th century and is considered to be sacred among sages.

==History==

Bharuch is the oldest city of Gujarat. It is also the second-oldest city of India, having displayed evidence of continuous habitation, the first being Kashi ([[Varanasi]]). [[Chandragupta II|Chandragupta Vikramaditya]] and other kings and queens of the Gupta dynasty ruled this city up to the 5th century CE; it was then ruled over by the kings of [[Gurjar|the Gurjara tribe]] until the 7th century CE. The time period of 8th century CE to 13th century CE was said to be an important and very well-known part under the rule of Rajput Emperors and Empresses. Solanki dynasty's great emperor [[Jayasimha Siddharaja|Siddharaja]] Jaisingha had built up Kota (fortification) and Darvaja (doors) around the whole of Bharuch. The fort has a number of gates, which were later named 'Malbari Darvaja', 'Katopor Darvaja' and 'Zadeshvari Darvaja'. In the first half of the 16th century, Bharuch was ruled over by Changez Khan. Then, the Mughal king [[Humayun]] conquered and took over Bharuch as Mughal territory in 1534 CE.

===BCE era===
[[File:Periplous_of_the_Erythraean_Sea.svg|thumb|250px|right| A map showing the ancient western trade routes serviced by this ancient and historical port. The gateway city of Bharutkutccha is named on the map as Barigaza on the [[Gulf of Khambhat]]. The inhospitable mountains and deserts to the north of the [[Arabian Sea|Erythraean Sea]] suggests its importance in trade with ancient [[Axum]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|Arabia]] and the sea-land trade routes via the [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian]] plains with [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]].]]
By the 6th century&nbsp;BCE, the city was readily accessible to outside trade via land-sea routes reaching the [[Levant]] to the [[Arab]] and [[Ethiopia]]n traders feeding goods westwards to the [[Egypt]]ians, [[Greeks]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], [[Roman Republic|Western Roman]]s, [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]]s, and eventually, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]s, and the [[Republic of Venice]]. It is likely even the [[Phoenicia]]ns knew of it; it has acted since antiquity as a link port to the luxury goods trade from the Far East and the interior of the Indian sub-continent to the civilisations of South-west Asia, the [[Middle-East]], the Mediterranean basin including Northern Africa and Europe.

During the Prarga–Maurya period in Gujarat, King Pradyota Mahavira of the [[Pradyota dynasty]] of Ujjain ruled over Bharutkutchha in 550 BCE. He was a contemporary of [[Gautama Buddha]]. The ''[[Theragatha]]'', part of the ''[[Pali Canon]]'' written down in Sri Lanka in the 1st century BCE, mentions Vaddha Thera and Malitavamba Thera of Bharukaccha, as contemporaries of the [[Buddha]], while the [[Therigatha]] of the same canon mentions Vaddhamta Theri of Bharukaccha. The ancient [[Sri Lanka]]n chronicle, the ''[[Dipavamsa]]'', mentions that the legendary king [[Vijaya of Sri Lanka|Vijaya]] stopped at Bharutkutchha for three months in 500 BCE.<ref>Herman Odenberg, ''The Dipavamsa'', New Delhi: Asian Educational Services, 2001. (first printed Berlin 1879)</ref>

Excavations near the banks of the river [[Narmada River|Narmada]] in Bharuch have revealed many archaeological and architectural wonders, mostly temples. Later Bharuch was part of the [[Maurya]]n Empire (322 BCE–185 BCE), the [[Western Satraps]], the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]]s and the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]]s.<ref name="Malabari 1998 2">{{cite book

The Maurya period was between 322 BCE and 185 BCE. The post-Maurya period is mentioned between 185 BCE and 23 CE. The Princess of Sri Lanka, Sudarshana had built the Shakunika Vihara in the Bharuch during the rule of Samprati (229 BCE–220 BCE), and a Bharuch trader became responsible for the memories of the princess. This depicts trade relations between Lata (South Gujarat) and Sri Lanka.

It was known to the Greeks and Romans as ''Barygaza'', and had a settlement of Greek and Roman traders. As one southern terminus of the [[Kamboja-Dvaravati Route]], it is mentioned extensively as a major trading partner of the Roman and Greek worlds, in the 1st century [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]. One of the [[Periplus|Periploi]] describes numerous Greek buildings and fortifications in the area, although mistakenly attributing them to early [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] who never reached this far south in the Indian Subcontinent as they ruled only lands to the west of the Indian Subcontinent before the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|Indo-Greeks]] ruled the western and northern Indian Subcontinent along with the Indian Subcontinental countries, as well as the circulation of Indo-Greek coinage in the region:
:"The metropolis of this country is [[Minnagara]], from which much cotton cloth is brought down to Barygaza. In these places there remain even to the present time signs of the visit of Greeks, such as ancient shrines, walls of forts and great wells." Periplus, Chapter. 41
:"To the present day ancient Drachmae are current in Barygaza, coming from this country, bearing inscriptions in [[Greek language|Greek]] letters, and the devices of those who reigned after [[Alexander the Great|Alexander III of Macedonia]], [[Apollodotus I]] and [[Menander I]]." Periplus Chapter. 47<ref>{{Cite web |title=Internet History Sourcebooks |url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/ancient/periplus.asp |access-date=2022-10-17 |website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu}}</ref>

===Kshatrapa era (23 CE–400 CE)===
In the 1st century AD, kings of Shaka community established their rule in Gujarat. [[Nahapana]], the king of Bharutakutchha was very prosperous. During the Kshatrapa era, Bharuch port was very prosperous. It was a gateway of trading through land and waters both routes. Like other ancient ports, trading of all commodities also took place at the Bharuch port.

During the decade of 70 CE–80 CE, coins of Greek writing were used in Bharuch. The activity region of Jain priest Arya Khapoota (1st century AD) was in the Aatapata region of Bharuch. He had released the Ashvabodha pilgrims in Bharuch out of the control of the Buddhists.

[[Image:Silver coin of Nahapana British Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Nahapana|King Nahapana]] (119 CE – 124 CE) of [[Kshatrapa]] era's silver coin.]]

Seven caves have been discovered from Kadiyadungar near Jajhapura, near Ankleshvara, of the Bharuch district. These caves are known as the Buddhist Viharas. It is believed that they were sculpted in the 1st century CE and 2nd century CE.

===Gupta era (415 CE–470 CE)===
During this time kings and queens of Trekutaka dynasty ruled the north of the Konkan and south of the Lata. Trekutaka ruled over the Surat district but the border of their state could not be decided. In the lines of Daspur of the weavers of Lata (South Gujarat) it has been mentioned that the Surya and Sanjana Temple was built in 437 CE at Bharuch.

=== Maitraka era (470 CE–788 CE) and Rashtrakuta era (788 CE–942 CE) ===
According to historical accounts, the Pratihara Empire with the capital at [[Bhinmal]] (or Srimal) was established by the [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty|Prathiharas]]. The kingdom of Bharuch was created by this Empire.<ref name="Malabari 1998 2"/>

It is known that in 540 CE which dynasty ruled over the Bharuch state in 540 CE, a Mahasamanta named Sangramasingha ruled over Bharuch, But nothing is known about the king. Chinese traveller [[Xuanzang]] crossed [[Narmada river]] in 640 CE and recorded that Bharutakutchha (Po Lu Ka Che Po) had around 10 Buddhist monasteries with around 300 monks.<ref name="The Times of India">{{cite web|title=Hiuen Tsang's Gujarat travel: 'Valabhi was at par with Nalanda' - TOI Mobile|website=The Times of India Mobile Site|date=14 September 2014|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Hiuen-Tsangs-Gujarat-travel-Valabhi-was-at-par-with-Nalanda/articleshow/42471893.cms|access-date=15 September 2014}}</ref> After this period, in 648 CE, the Rashuddin Caliph [[Uthman]] had tried to attack Bharuch but the Maitraka forces killed all the Arab forces and won over them. In 648 AD, King Dhanasena –the fourth king of [[Vallabhi]] had put his winning camp in Bharuch with his forces after killing off all Arab forces and defeating them with fully ruling the Maitraka nation. A Muslim traveller Al–Biladuri had written in his notes about this in 713 CE – 714 CE.

The Arab Muslim ruler of [[Sindh|Sindhu]], Husam bin Amru came to Gandhara port by boat with his forces, trying to attack Bharuch. He and his forces tried to destroy the Hindu deities's idols and the Hindu Temples and to build [[Mosque]]s in place of them in the time of 760 CE, but the Maitraka forces killed Hussain Bin Amru and all his forces and won over them and the Hindu Temples with their Hindu deities' idols were present without any mosques. In the post Maitraka era, during 788 CE – 942 CE Rashtrakuta kings and queens of south Lata ruled over Bharuch. Their reign was attempted to be stopped by [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] incursions and raids, but the Rashtrakutas repelled all the Umayyad incursions and raids and they fully ruled Bharuch and the Prathiharas conquered Sindhu, Baluchistan, Punjab, Kangra, and Gandhara, Kamboja all from the Indian Subcontinental nations and the Umayyad Caliphate, all happening with the collaboration of the Rashtrakutas and other Indian subcontinental nations and near Bharuch itself.

===Chalukya era (942 CE–1304 CE)===
In 942, [[Mularaja]] established the rule of [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chaulukya]] (Solanki) dynasty in Anahilvada [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]]. Till this time the importance of Bharuch as the trade centre was continued. It was the capital of [[Lata (region)|Lata]] region at the start of the 11th century CE. It was the centre for the ships coming from China and Sindhu and other regions of the world and the Indian Subcontinent in the 12th century and the Chalukya minister [[Vastupala]] had established a library in Bharuch. It was also during the time around from 1008 CE-1030 CE that [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] and his forces had made several attempted raids into [[Gujarat]] to raid the land and the Indian Subcontinental rulers of Gujarat and other lands with their forces defeated them all and all the forces of Mahmud of Ghazni were killed and defeated by them, and the surviving forces of Mahmud of Ghazni and Mahmud of Ghazni himself fled back to Central Asia each time they tried to sack the [[Somnath temple|Somnath Temple]] and Gujarat. Later Mahmud of Ghazni himself was killed by [[Bhoja]] and Ghazni's forces were killed by the Paramaras and their allies as known in historical sources. The destruction and killing of the [[Ghaznavid]] incursions by the Indian Subcontinent occurred in the [[Gujarat]] countryside including the area of Bharuch and outside it too.

[[Chakradhar Swami|Chakradhara Svami]] of Bharuch was during the era of the Chalukya Emperor Bhimadeva II. He established the [[Mahanubhava]] community which was spread in Maharashtra. In the 1100 CEs the region was subject to more attempted raids and their destruction by the Indian Subcontinental rulers and their forces by the [[Ghurids]] under [[Muhammad of Ghor]] and his forces and the Ghurid invasions of Muhammad of Ghor and his forces had all their forces killed by the Indian Subcontinental rulers and their forces and Muhammad of Ghor was killed by [[Prithviraj Chauhan]] and Ghori's forces were killed by the Indian Subcontinent rulers and their forces too as said in historical sources.

===Middle Ages era (1293 CE–1872 CE)===
[[File:Brotsch int ryck vanden Grooten Mogol en Indien - Peeters Jacob - 1690.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|"Bharuch", by Peeters Jacob, 1690 CE]]
The middle era history of Bharuch district can be divided into three main parts, out of which, we can say that [[Delhi Sultanate]] era (1297 CE–1407 CE), [[Gujarat Sultanate]] era (1407 CE–1573 CE) and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] era (1573 CE–1736 CE). Bharuch was the centre of a prosperous merchant community and was one of the chief ports of Gujarat from ancient times to the first half of the 16th century.

=== Portuguese Attacks ===
Until the beginning of the 16th century, the Portuguese [[Catholic]] [[Christians]] had little contact with the city, only in 1536 CE and 1547 CE, when there were attacks on operations from Daman and Diu against the governors of Gujarat for not paying for the Posters (Cartaz) system. After the attacks when [[Jorge de Menezes]] plundered Bharuch in 1547 CE, the city fell into insignificance.

In the 17th century CE, the Dutch and British made it a centre of their cotton purchases in Gujarat,<ref>D. Barbosa, "The Book"</ref> and commercial warehouses were established in 1616 CE and 1618 CE by the British and Dutch respectively and others later. After that, in 1675 CE and 1686 CE, it was sacked by the Marathas. During this period, Bharuch was handed over to Kutubuddin. Mughal [[Emperor]] Aurangzeb demolished the fortification and the fort in 1660 CE by attacking. Later on, he built it again in 1686 CE. In 1772 CE, the British again attacked Bharuch, defeating Nawab Mu'azzaz Khan, allegedly with the help of his treacherous minister, Diwan Lallubhai. The British handed over Bharuch to the Marathas who ruled between 1783 CE and 1802 CE. From 1802 CE, Bharuch was returned to the East India Company under the terms of the [[Treaty of Salbai]].

Bharuch was ruled by [[Delhi Sultanate]] for 94 years, The independent [[Gujarat Sultanate]] for 181 years, [[Mughal Empire]] for 164 years, Independent [[Nawab]]s for 36 years and Maratha rule for 19 years. During these times, revenue was collected from Bharuch and hundreds of people, especially the rich people, were killed. Same way in the cities on the banks of river Kavi in Jambusar Taluka there were many big and rich Hindu and Muslim communities. They were mainly formed by foreign and native traders.

As part of the [[Sultanate of Gujarat]], it was subsequently annexed by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], and finally by the British. It is also situated near a small City called Halderva where two Islamic priests were found performing miracles.

On taking a bird's eye view of the financial structure of the whole era of Gujarat's sultanate, it can be seen that the area was cheaper and prosperous also when Akbar had won over the Bharuch during the Mughal era it had 12 Paraganas. The annual growth of all 559 Cities of Bharuch, [[Hansot]], Olpad, Mandvi, Galaa, Jambusar, Dahej, Koral, Ankleshvara and Tadakeshwar Parganas was Rs. 7.5&nbsp;million. As given in the [[Tabaqat-i-Akbari|Tabaqat-i Akbari]], there is a description of severe drought and the spread of a contentious epidemic in Gujarat, which was later fertilized and cured to the end.

===Mughal era (1605 CE–1627 CE)===
On understanding the importance of the Bharuch district as the trade centre, the British had taken permission from [[Jahangir]] to establish the office during this era. Jahangir also permitted trade to the British. A big office building built by the Dutch in the 18th century can be seen in the Kansarvad in Bharuch. This building has a fort around it.

===Attacks and sackings by the Marathas (1664 CE to 1685 CE)===
[[Marathas]] had plundered Bharuch twice while it was under Mughal rule. Six droughts between 1681 CE and 1696 CE ended the ports' prosperity. By the end of the 17th century CE, their place was taken over due to the development of Mumbai port. In 1772 CE, after the control of Bharuch was taken by the British, the Dutch also left their trade centre in Bharuch.

=== Independent Nawabs of Bharuch (1736 CE to 1772 CE) ===

[[File:Letterhead of Mirza Moazziz Khan Ex Nawab Of Bharuch.jpg|thumb|This is the letterhead and logo that Mirza Moaziz Khan Ex Nawab of Bharuch Used that time ]]
When the Mughal [[subahdar]] Nizam-ul-Mulk was given the independent control of Bharuch as his fief, the Nizam soon threw off the suzerainty of the [[Mughals]] and started acting independent of Mughal rule. He appointed a loyal commander named Abdullah as the administrator of Bharuch with the title 'Nek Alam Khan'. Nek Alam Khan became independent of the Nizam's control in 1736 CE and assumed independent control of Bharuch. This is the start of a short-lived dynasty of the Nawabs of Bharuch. Nek Alam Khan died in 1738 CE and was succeeded by his son Mirza Beg who also assumed the title of Nek Alam Khan. During this period, independent Nawabs ruled over Bharuch. Mirza Baig, Ahmed Baig, Hakim Mirza, Mirza Mohabbat Khan Those who were given poison, due to which they died and their son who was Mirza Moazziz Khan, he took the title of Nawab of Bharuch And then a treaty was signed with the [[East India Company]] and the pension was implemented, hence this pension will be given to the future generations of Nawab of Bharuch. He did not get along with the [[East India Company]] So he left Bharuch and then started living with his Royal Family in the [[Jaora State]] in the Indian State of [[Madhya Pradesh]] They all were originally from Bharuch but they shifted their residence to [[Jaora State]] in Madhya Pradesh in the 18th century CE and it is their current residence, far away from their ancestral residence, which is [[Bharuch]], Gujarat. After they immigrated to Jaora State in Madhya Pradesh, India, Bharuch was ruled by the many royal states of the Indian Subcontinent in [[Gujarat]] under many [[Indian subcontinent]] rulers and Europeans from many nations in Europe together for many centuries together.

=== Pre-independence era and Post-independence era ===

The Dandi Kuch arrived in Kareli City on 20 and 22 March 1930 CE and became a memorial day in Jambusar, proving the history of the freedom struggle.

==Geography and climate==
Bharuch is located at {{Coord|21.7|N|72.97|E|}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/09/Bharuch.html|title=Bharuch|website=fallingrain.com|access-date=7 March 2023}}</ref> It has an average elevation of 15&nbsp;metres (49&nbsp;feet). Bharuch is a port city situated on the banks of the [[Narmada River]]. The damming of the Narmada caused the original port facilities to close, the nearest port is now in [[Dahej]]. The Bharuch district is surrounded by Vadodara (North), Narmada (East) and Surat (South) districts. To the west is the [[Gulf of Khambhat]].

Bharuch has a [[tropical savanna climate]] (under [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen's Climate classification]]), moderated strongly by the Arabian Sea. The summer begins in early March and lasts until June. April and May are the hottest months, the average maximum temperature being {{convert|40|C|F}}. [[Monsoon]] begins in late June and the Village receives about {{convert|800|mm|in}} of rain by the end of September, with the average maximum being {{convert|32|C|F}} during those months. October and November see the retreat of the monsoon and a return of high temperatures until late November. Winter starts in December and ends in late February, with average temperatures of around {{convert|23|C|F}}.

Very often heavy monsoon rain brings floods in the Narmada basin area. The Village had witnessed major floods in the past, but now the floods have been controlled after the damming of the Narmada.

==Economy, commerce and industry==
[[Image:peanutjar.jpg|thumb|right|[[Peanut|Salty peanuts]]]]
[[File:CottonPlant.JPG|thumb|right|[[Cotton]]]]
[[File:Bandhej.JPG|thumb|[[Bandhani|Bandhni]]]]
Bharuch has always been prosperous because of its location on the Narmada River. Although water tends to be scarce in Gujarat, one never finds difficulty in getting water in Bharuch. As a result of this, agriculture and other linked commercial activities have flourished in Bharuch. Bharuch is also a central stopping point for many villages spread around its boundaries. People from these small villages come to Bharuch when they want to shop for new clothes or make a major purchase. Lately, a lot of retiring expatriates have been returning to Bharuch and building new houses giving the economy a boost.

Traditionally, Bharuch has been the centre of the peanut processing and marketing industry with a well-established brand name around the country. Almost none of the peanuts are grown in Bharuch itself but the best of the crops from neighbouring regions are brought here for processing. Bharuch is also the home of the [[Bandhani|Bandhni]] method of clothing design and is well known for this traditional art form.

At present, this heavily industrialised area is renowned for its textile mills, chemical plants, long-staple cotton, dairy products, and much more. Gujarat's biggest liquid cargo terminal is situated here. It also houses many reputed multinational companies like Videocon, BASF, Reliance, Welspun Stahl, etc. Bharuch is a shopping centre well known for its salty peanuts. Because of the distinctive colour of the soil here that is ideal for cotton cultivation, Bharuch is sometimes referred to as 'Kanam Pradesh' (black soil land).

Over the past 60 years, a major part of the population has moved to countries like the UK, USA, the African continent, and other parts of Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vahoravoice.co.uk/about/|title=About|accessdate=7 March 2023}}</ref> This brings some economical boost to the local businesses as people come back for vacations and spend their earnings here.

===Trade===
Bharuch was a major [[sea port]] in the important [[compass|pre-compass]] [[trade|coastal trading]] routes to points West, perhaps as far back as the days of the Pharaohs, which utilised the regular and predictable [[Monsoon]] winds or [[galley]]s. Many goods from the Far East were trans-shipped there for the annual monsoon winds making it a terminus for several key land-sea [[trade routes]] and Bharuch was definitely known to the Greeks, the various [[Persian Empire]]s and in the [[Rome|Roman Republic and Empire]] and other Western centres of civilisation, through the end of the European [[Middle Ages]].<ref name="Periplus of the Erythraean Sea"/><ref name="depts.washington.edu"/>

In the 1st century AD, Bharuch port has been mentioned as Barigaza. Bharuch which was a prosperous and powerful port was an important part of Gujarat until the 16th century. Arab traders used to enter Gujarat via Bharuch. British, Valandas, and others accepted the importance of Bharuch and established premises and local staff here. At the end of the 17th century, the city was plundered twice but resurged quickly after the plunder and a proverb/refrain arose, "Bhangyu Bhangyu Toye Bharuch".

As a trading depot, the limitations of coastal shipping made it a regular terminus via several mixed trade routes of the fabled spice and silk trading between East and West.

[[Narmada River]]'s inland access to central and northern India and with a location in the sheltered [[Gulf of Khambhat]] in the era of coastal sea travel grew and prospered as a trading transshipment centre and shipbuilding port. Until very modern times the only effective way to move goods was by [[water transport]], and Bharuch had sheltered waters in an era without weather forecasting, compasses, and when shipping was necessarily limited to coastal navigation, and the general east–west course of the Narmada gave access to the rich inland empires at the upper reaches of the Narmada, including easy caravan access to the [[Ganges]] valley and the plains of [[Delhi]].

Broach then (1500-1700) was a major [[textile]] manufacturing hub. The Broach city was famous for its [[Bafta cloth|bafta]] in the West and Southeast Asian markets. Bafta cloth was among the leading textile products exported to Europe and other parts of the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/in.gov.ignca.66267/66267_djvu.txt|title=Surat in the seventeenth century|year=1978}}</ref>
