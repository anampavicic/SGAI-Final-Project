==History==
The area of the modern city of Ibaraki was within ancient [[Settsu Province]], and was the site of  large settlements in the [[Yayoi period]] and was the location of large [[kofun|burial mound]]s in the [[Kofun period]], including the [[Ota Chausuyama Kofun]], which is designated by the [[Imperial Household Agency]] as the mausoleum of [[Emperor Keitai]]. In the first half of the [[Muromachi period]], [[Kusunoki Masashige]] built Ibaraki Castle, and the ''[[jōkamachi]]'' which was established around this castle became the core of the modern city. In the [[Sengoku period]], the area was ruled by the Christian ''[[daimyō]]'', [[Takayama Ukon]]. In the [[Edo Period]], it was directly controlled by [[Tokugawa shogunate]] due to its strategic importance on the [[Sanyōdō]] highway. The village of Ibaraki was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889.  On April 1, 1896 the area became part of [[Mishima District, Osaka]]. Ibaraki was raised to town status on October 14, 1898 and to city status on January 1, 1948.
