The region around Kirkuk was known historically in the [[Eastern Aramaic]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] Assyrian sources as "Beth Garmai" ({{langx|syr|ܒܝܬܓܪܡܝ}}).

==History==
===Ancient history===
It is suggested that Kirkuk was one of the places occupied by [[Neanderthals]] based on archeological findings in the [[Shanidar Cave]] settlement.<ref name=CAHipi256>{{Harvnb|Edwards|Gadd|Hammond|1991|p=256}}</ref> A large amount of pottery shards dating to the [[Ubaid period]] were also excavated from several [[Tell (archaeology)|Tell]]s in the city.<ref name=CAHipi374>{{Harvnb|Edwards|Gadd|Hammond|1991|p=374}}</ref>

===Early Bronze===
====Akkadian Period====
Ancient [[Arrapkha]] was a part of [[Sargon of Akkad]]'s [[Akkadian Empire]] (2335–2154 BC),<ref name=CAHipi433>{{Harvnb|Edwards|Charlesworth|Boardman|1970|p=433}}</ref> and city was exposed to the raids of the [[Lullubi]] during [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin's]] reign.<ref name=CAHipi443>{{Harvnb|Edwards|Charlesworth|Boardman|1970|p=443}}</ref>

====Gutian Period====
Later the city was occupied around 2150 BC by [[language Isolate]] speaking Zagros Mountains dwellers who were known as the Gutian people by the Semitic and Sumerian of Mesopotamians. Arraphkha was the capital of the short-lived Guti kingdom (Gutium).

====Ur III Period====
The Gutians were driven from Mesopotamia by the [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]] c. 2115 BC.<ref name="William Gordon East 1961">William Gordon East, Oskar Hermann Khristian Spate (1961). ''The Changing Map of Asia: A Political Geography'', 436 pages, p: 105</ref><ref>Georges Roux- Ancient Iraq</ref>

===Middle Bronze===
Arrapkha became a part of the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] (c.2025–1750 BC), before [[Hammurabi]] briefly subjected Assyria to the short-lived [[Babylonian Empire]], after which it again became a part of [[Assyria]] c.1725 BC.

===Late Bronze===
====Mitanni Period====
However, by the middle of the 2nd millennium B.C. the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] [[Mittani]] of [[Anatolia]] formed a ruling class over the [[language isolate]] speaking [[Hurrians]], and began to expand into a [[Hurri]]-[[Mitanni]] Empire. In the 1450s they attacked Assyria, sacking [[Assur]], and bringing the cities of [[Gasur]] and Arrapkha under their control.<ref name="M. Chahin p. 77">{{cite book|last=Chahin|first=M|title=Before the Greeks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gal_11QHPqUC&pg=PA77|access-date=3 January 2013|year=1996|publisher=James Clarke & Co.|isbn=978-0-7188-2950-6|page=77}}</ref> From c.1450 to 1393 BC the kings of Assyria paid tribute to the kingdom of Mittani.<ref name="M.

====Assyrian Period====
The [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365–1020 BC) overthrew the Hurri-Mitanni in the mid 14th century BC. Arrapha became part of [[Assyria]] proper, whith the Hurrian population driven away from the region. In the 11th and 10th centuries BC the city rose to prominence, becoming an important city in Assyria until the fall of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–605 BC).<ref>{{cite web|last=Talabany|first=Nouri|year=1999|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/business/laur/791/nouri_kirkuk.htm|title=Iraq's Policy of Ethnic Cleansing: Onslaught to change national/demographic characteristics of the Kirkuk Region|access-date=2006-06-05|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010909025453/http://www.fortunecity.com/business/laur/791/nouri_kirkuk.htm|archive-date=9 September 2001|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Iron Age===
It remained as such throughout the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–605 BC) where it became an important Assyrian city.

After the fall of Assyria between 612 and 599 BC it was still an integral part of the geo-political province of Assyria – [[Achaemenid Assyria]], [[Athura]], [[Seleucid Syria]], [[Assyria (Roman province)]] and [[Assuristan]]. In the [[Parthia]]n and [[Sassanid]] eras Kirkuk was capital of the small Assyrian state of [[Beth Garmai]] (c.160 BC–250 AD).<ref>{{cite web|title=BĒṮ GARMĒ|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bet-garme|publisher=Iranica|access-date=3 May 2012}}</ref>

The city briefly came to be part of the short-lived [[Median Empire]] before falling to the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (546–332 BC) where it was incorporated into the province of [[Athura]] ([[Achaemenid Assyria]]).<ref>Martin Sicker.

''The Cambridge Ancient History''. p. 178-179.</ref>

Later it became part of the [[Macedonian Empire]] (332–312 BC) and succeeding [[Seleucid Empire]] (311–150 BC) before falling to the [[Parthian Empire]] (150 BC–224 AD) as a part of Athura. The Parthians seemed to only exercise loose control, and a number of small [[Neo-Assyrian]] kingdoms sprang up in the region between the 2nd century BC and 4th century AD, one such kingdom named "ܒܝܬܓܪܡܝ", (that is Bit Garmai in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]) had Arrapha as its capital.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mohsen|first=Zakeri|title=Sasanid soldiers in early Muslim society: the origins of 'Ayyārān and Futuwwa|year=1995|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-03652-8|pages=135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VfYnu5F20coC&pg=PA135}}</ref> Christianity also arose during this period, with Arrapha and its surrounds being influenced by the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. The [[Sassanid Empire]] destroyed these kingdoms during 3rd and early 4th centuries AD, and Arrapha was incorporated into Sassanid ruled [[Assuristan]] (Sassanid Assyria).

In AD 341, the [[Zoroastrian]] [[Shapur II]] ordered the massacre of all [[Assyrian Christians]] in the Persian Sassanid Empire. During the persecution, about 1,150 were martyred in Arrapha.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ocafs.oca.org/Caption.asp?FSID=101122 |title=OCA – Hieromartyr Simeon the Bishop in Persia, and those with him in Persia |publisher=Ocafs.oca.org |date=17 April 2013 |access-date=14 October 2013}}</ref>

===Islamic Conquests of Mesopotamia===
{{Unsourced section|date=July 2024}}

[[Arab]] [[Muslims]] fought the [[Sassanid]] empire in the 7th century AD, conquering the region. The city was a part of the Islamic [[Caliphate]] until the tenth century. Kirkuk and the surrounding areas were then ruled by the [[Hasanwayhids|Hasanwayhid Kurds]] & [[Annazids|Annazid Kurds]] from 1014 to 1120 AD, then it was taken over by [[Great Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Turks]] for many years. After the divided empire collapsed, the city came under the Abbasids rule once again Suleiman Shah who was the governor of the city until it was taken over by [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] in 1258. After the Mongol invasion, the [[Ilkhanate]] was founded in the region and the city became a part of it. The Ilkhanid rule ended when in 1336, the [[Ardalan]] took over the city, despite being vassals themselves of the various in [[Persia]] centred succeeding Turkic federations in the region, namely that of the [[Qara Qoyunlu]], and the [[Aq Qoyunlu]] specifically. After the [[Battle of Chaldiran]] in 1514 the city came under the [[Soran Emirate]] control until it was taken over by [[Baban|Babanids]] in 1694. In 1851 it became under direct control of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Ottoman rule continued until [[World War I]] when the Ottomans were pushed out of the region by the [[British Empire]].

===British occupation===
At the end of World War I, the British occupied Kirkuk on 7 May 1918. Abandoning the city after about two weeks, the British returned to Kirkuk a few months later after the [[Armistice of Mudros]]. Kirkuk avoided the troubles caused by the Kurdish nationalist [[Mahmud Barzanji]], who quickly attempted to overthrow the British Mandate in Iraq and establish his own fiefdom in [[Sulaymaniyah]].

===Entry into the Kingdom of Iraq===
As both Turkey and Great Britain desperately wanted control of the [[Vilayet of Mosul]] (of which Kirkuk was a part), the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923 failed to solve the issue. For this reason, the [[Mosul Question|question of Mosul]] was sent to the [[League of Nations]]. A committee travelled to the area before coming to a final decision: the territory south of the "Brussels line" belonged to Iraq. By the Treaty of Angora of 1926, Kirkuk became a part of the [[Kingdom of Iraq]].

===Discovery of oil===
{{Main|Kirkuk Field}}
[[File:Kirkukoil.jpg|thumb|[[Baba Gurgur]]]]

In 1927, Iraqi and [[Americans|American]] drillers working for the foreign-owned and British-led [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC) struck a huge [[oil gusher]] at [[Baba Gurgur]] ("St. Blaze" or father blaze in Kurdish) near Kirkuk. The IPC began exports from the Kirkuk oil field in 1934. The Company moved its headquarters from Tuz Khormatu to a camp on the outskirts of Kirkuk, which they named Arrapha after the ancient city. Arrapha remains a large neighborhood in Kirkuk to this day. The IPC exercised significant political power in the city and played a central role in Kirkuk's urbanization, initiating housing and development projects in collaboration with Iraqi authorities in the 1940s and 1950s.<ref>Bet-Shlimon, Arbella. 2013.

The presence of the oil industry had an effect on Kirkuk's demographics. The exploitation of Kirkuk's oil, which began around 1930, attracted both Arabs and Kurds to the city in search of work. Kirkuk, which had been a predominantly Iraqi Turkmen city, gradually lost its uniquely Turkmen character.<ref name="mod-hist-kurds-329-330"/><ref>Chapter 1: Introduction: Kurdish Identity and Social Formation, page 3. // A Modern History of the Kurds.

Some analysts believe that poor [[Oil reservoir|reservoir]]-management practices during the [[Saddam Hussein]] years may have seriously, and even permanently, damaged Kirkuk's oil field. One example showed an estimated {{convert|1500000000|oilbbl}} of excess fuel oil being reinjected. Other problems include refinery residue and gas-stripped [[Petroleum|oil]]. Fuel oil reinjection has increased oil [[viscosity]] at Kirkuk making it more difficult and expensive to get the oil out of the ground.<ref>{{cite web|date=9 July 2005|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/kirkuk.htm|title=Kirkuk|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|access-date=2006-06-05}}</ref>

Over all, between April 2003 and late December 2004 there were an estimated 123 attacks on Iraqi energy infrastructures, including the country's 7,000&nbsp;km-long [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] system. In response to these attacks, which cost [[Iraq]] billions of US dollars in lost oil-export revenues and repair costs, the US military set up the [[Task Force Shield]] to guard Iraq's energy infrastructure and the [[Kirkuk–Ceyhan Oil Pipeline]] in particular. In spite of the fact that little damage was done to Iraq's oil fields during the war itself, [[looting]] and [[sabotage]] after the war ended was highly destructive and accounted for perhaps eighty percent of the total damage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/iraq.html|title=Iraq|work=Country Analysis Briefs|publisher=Energy Information Administration|access-date=2006-06-05|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060606034149/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/iraq.html|archive-date=6 June 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The discovery of vast quantities of oil in the region after [[World War I]] provided the impetus for the annexation of the former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Vilayet of Mosul (of which the Kirkuk region was a part), to the Iraqi Kingdom, established in 1921. Since then and particularly from 1963 onwards, there have been continuous attempts to transform the ethnic make-up of the region.

Pipelines from Kirkuk run through [[Turkey]] to [[Ceyhan]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and were one of the two main routes for the export of Iraqi oil under the [[Oil-for-Food Programme]] following the [[Gulf War]] of 1991. This was in accordance with a United Nations mandate that at least 50% of the oil exports pass through Turkey. There were two parallel lines built in 1977 and 1987.

In 1970 the Iraqi government reached an agreement with Kurdish leader [[Mustafa Barzani]] called the [[Iraqi–Kurdish Autonomy Agreement of 1970|March Agreement of 1970]], but the question of whether the oil-rich province of Kirkuk would be included within the Kurdish autonomous region remained unresolved, pending a new census.<ref name="mod-hist-kurds-329-330">Book IV. Ethno-nationalism in Iraq. – 16. The Kurds under the Baath, 1968–1975, page 329–330. // A Modern History of the Kurds. Author: David McDowall. Third edition. First published in 1996. Third revised and updated edition published in 2004, reprinted in 2007. London: [[I.B. Tauris]], 2007, 515 pages. {{ISBN|9781850434160}}. "It now began to look as if the Baath were playing for time and the year 1971 brought a disintegration of trust between the two parties. The central issue was a demographic one. The census (Article 14) for disputed areas planned for December 1970 had been postponed till the spring by mutual agreement, but when spring came it was unilaterally postponed sine die. Mulla Mustafa accused the government of resettling Arabs in the contested areas, Kirkuk, Khanaqin and Sinjar, and told the government he would not accept the census results if they indicated an Arab majority. He also dismissed the offer of the 1965 census, which he said was forged. When the government proposed to apply the 1957 census to Kirkuk, Mulla Mustafa refused it, since this was bound to show that the Turkomans, although outnumbered in the governorate as a whole, were still predominant in Kirkuk town. Given the residual animosity after the events of July 1959, the Turkomans were likely to opt for Ba'ati rather than Kurdish rule. The Baath thought the Kurds might be packing disputed areas with Kurds from Iran and Turkey, but the real tensions surfaced over the Faili Kurds, resident in Iraq since Ottoman days and yet without Iraqi citizenship. The government argued they were Iranians, and now determined their fate by the simple expedient of expelling roughly 50,000 of them from September onwards."</ref><ref name=crisis>{{Cite book| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| isbn = 978-0-8122-0604-3| last1 = Anderson| first1 = Liam| last2 = Stansfield| first2 = Gareth| title = Crisis in Kirkuk: The Ethnopolitics of Conflict and Compromise| chapter=2.

Despite the signing of the March Agreement, relations between the Kurds and Iraqi government continued to deteriorate due to the unresolved status of Kirkuk, and there were two attempts to assassinate Barzani in 1972. In response to Barzani's continued demands during the early 1970s for Kirkuk to be recognized as part of the autonomous region under the terms of the March Agreement, settlement construction for newly arrived Arab families increased drastically as the [[Ba'athist Arabization campaigns in North Iraq|Ba'athist government implemented Arabization policies]] to increase the Arab population of Kirkuk. Kurds were forbidden from buying property in Kirkuk, and could sell their properties only to Arabs. They were denied permission to renovate properties in need of maintenance, and poor Shi'a Arab families were paid to move to Kirkuk, while Kurds were paid to move out.<ref name=crisis />

Negotiations between Barzani's [[Kurdish Democratic Party]] and the Iraqi government collapsed in March 1974 and Barzani rejected President [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]] declaration of Kurdish autonomy. Many disputes persisted between the Kurds and Arabs and the conflict escalated into the [[Second Iraqi–Kurdish War]] (also called the Barzani rebellion). The rebellion collapsed after Iran withdrew its support for Barzani's forces following the [[1975 Algiers Agreement]] and the Ba'ath regime intensified Arabization efforts.<ref name=crisis /><ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| isbn = 978-0-275-94575-6| last = Peretz| first = Don| title = The Middle East Today| chapter=15.

After Barzani's rebellion was defeated in 1974, the districts of Chemchemal and [[Kelar]], which had been part of Kirkuk, became part of [[Sulaymaniyah]] and [[Kifri]] became part of [[Diyala Governorate|Diyala province]].

===Nationalization of Iraqi Petroleum Company===
In 1972 the Iraqi government, led by then Vice-President Saddam Hussein, nationalized the [[Iraqi Petroleum Company]] (IPC), after being unable to reach an agreement that would increase oil exports and resolve a longstanding dispute over [[Law 80 of 1961]]. The Iraqi government began to sell its oil to [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern bloc]] countries and the IPC's French partner CFP. After reaching an agreement with the Iraqis in 1973, the IPC members were able to retain some of their interests in southern Iraq through the Basra Petroleum Company but had lost Iraq's main oilfields, including the Kirkuk field.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-78515-0| last = Bamberg| first = James| title = British Petroleum and Global Oil 1950-1975: The Challenge of Nationalism| chapter=18.

===Gulf War===
In 1991, Saddam Hussein invaded [[Kuwait]] and was quickly routed by the United States in the [[Gulf War|First Gulf War]] (also called ''Operation Desert Storm''). In the aftermath of the Iraqi army's defeat, rebellions broke out in Iraq; first in southern Iraq on March 1, and in the northern Kurdish region a few days later. By March 24, Kurdish ''[[Peshmerga]]'' forces had [[1991 uprising in Kirkuk|seized control]] of Kirkuk, but they were only able to hold it until March 28 when it was reclaimed by Hussein's forces.<ref name=sluglett>{{Cite book| publisher = I.B.Tauris| isbn = 978-0-85771-373-5| last1 = Farouk-Sluglett| first1 = Marion| last2 = Sluglett| first2 = Peter| title = Iraq Since 1958: From Revolution to Dictatorship|chapter=9.

Arabs families were expelled from the Kurdish region and relocated to Kirkuk, which was still controlled by the Iraqi government. In these circumstances, Hussein's government further intensified the decades long policy of Arabization in Kirkuk, requiring that Kurds, Turkmen and Assyrians fill out "ethnic identity correction" forms and register as Arabs and many who refused to comply were forcibly relocated north of the Green Line.<ref name=crisis /> In May 1991, [[Massoud Barzani]] announced that [[Baghdad]] had conceded Kirkuk as the capital of the autonomous region, but when the Iraqi government demanded the Kurds join the Ba'athist government the dispute once again escalated to violent conflict and in October 1991 Iraqi forces had withdrawn from several Kurdish provinces in the North including [[Erbil]], [[Dohuk]] and [[Sulaymaniyah]].<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Pluto Press| isbn =978-0-7453-2662-7| last = Yildiz| first = Kerim| title = The Kurds in Iraq: The Past, Present and Future| chapter=The First Gulf War: From Uprising to Democracy | year=2007| jstor = j.ctt18fs45h| doi =10.2307/j.ctt18fs45h}}</ref>

=== Iraq War (2003–2011) and return of displaced Kurds ===
[[File:Iraqi Personnel Graduate From Kirkuk Training Center DVIDS236956.jpg|thumb|Iraqi Personnel Graduate From Kirkuk]]

American and British military forces led an [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] in March 2003, marking the start of the [[Iraq War|Second Iraq War]]. Kurdish ''peshmerga'' fighters assisted in the 2003 capture of Kirkuk. Though the ''peshmerga'' were allowed to operate even after the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] (CPA) disbanded and outlawed most of the armed militias in Iraq, the ''peshmerga'' were eventually asked to withdraw from Kirkuk and other Kurdish held provinces.<ref name=federalism />

Under the supervision of chief executive of [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] [[L. Paul Bremer]], a convention was held on 24 May 2003 to select the first City Council in the history of this oil-rich, ethnically divided city. Each of the city's four major [[ethnic groups]] was invited to send a 39-member [[delegation]] from which they would be allowed to select six to sit on the City Council. Another six council members were selected from among 144 delegates to represent independents social groups such as teachers, lawyers, religious leaders and artists.

Kirkuk's 30 members council is made up of five blocs of six members each. Four of those blocs are formed along ethnic lines—[[Kurd]]s, [[Arab]]s, [[Assyria]]n and [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmen]]—and the fifth is made up of [[independent (politician)|independents]] which meant 10 more council seats given to two main Kurdish Parties by Paul Bremer as token of appreciation for cooperation with American Forces. Turkmen and Arabs complained that the [[Kurd]]s allegedly hold five of the seats in the independent block. They were also infuriated that their only representative at the council's helm was an assistant mayor whom they considered pro-Kurdish. [[Abdul Rahman Mustafa]] ({{langx|ar|عبدالرحمن مصطفى }}), a [[Baghdad]]-educated lawyer was elected mayor by 20 [[vote]]s to 10. The appointment of an Arab, [[Ismail Ahmed Rajab Al Hadidi]] ({{langx|ar|اسماعيل احمد رجب الحديدي }}), as deputy mayor went some way towards addressing Arab concerns.

On 30 June 2005, through a secret direct voting process, with the participation of the widest communities in the province and despite all the political legal security complexities of this process in the country generally and in Kirkuk in particular, Kirkuk witnessed the birth of its first elected Provincial Council. The Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq IECI approved the elections and announced the outcome of this process, which filled the 41 seats of [[Kirkuk Provincial Council]] as follows:

* 26 seats 367 List Kirkuk Brotherhood List KBL
* 8 seats 175 List Iraqi Turkmen Front ITF
* 5 seats 299 List Iraqi Republic Gathering
* 1 seats 178 List Turkmen Islamic Coalition
* 1 seats 289 List Iraqi National Gathering

The new [[Kirkuk Provincial Council]] started its second turn on 6 March 2005. Its inaugural session was dedicated to the introduction of its new members, followed by an oath ceremony supervised by Judge Thahir Hamza Salman, the Head of Kirkuk Appellate Court.

Kirkuk is located in a disputed area of Iraq that runs from [[Sinjar]] on the Syrian border southeast to [[Khanaqin]] and [[Mandali, Iraq|Mandali]] on the Iranian border.<ref name=bartu>{{Cite journal| volume = 86| issue = 6| pages = 1329–1343| last = Bartu| first=Peter |title = Wrestling with the integrity of a nation: the disputed internal boundaries in Iraq| journal = International Affairs| jstor = 40929765| year = 2010| doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2346.2010.00946.x}}</ref> Kirkuk has been a disputed territory for around eighty years — Kurds wanted Kirkuk to become part of the [[Kurdistan Region]], which has been opposed by the region's Arab and Turkmen populations.<ref name=galbraith>{{Cite book| publisher = Simon and Schuster| isbn = 978-1-4165-6225-2| last = Galbraith| first = Peter W.| title = Unintended Consequences: How War in Iraq Strengthened America's Enemies| chapter = Turkey| date = 2008| chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/unintendedconseq00galb}}</ref>

The Kurds sought to annex the long disputed territory to the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] (KRG) through Article 140 of the [[Constitution of Iraq|Iraqi Constitution]] that was enacted in 2005.<ref name=gunter>{{Cite book| publisher = Rowman & Littlefield| isbn = 978-1-5381-1050-8| last = Gunter| first = Michael M.| title = Historical Dictionary of the Kurds| date = 2018-02-20}}</ref><ref name=galbraith /> Under Article 140 the Ba'athist Arabization policy would be reversed: Displaced Kurds who had relocated to areas in the Kurdish autonomous region would return to Kirkuk, while the Arab Shi'a population would be compensated and relocated to areas in the south.

Under Kurdish control, Turkmen and Arab residents in Kirkuk experienced intimidation, harassment and were forced to leave their homes, in order to increase the Kurdish demographic in Kirkuk and bolster their claims to the city. Multiple [[Human Rights Watch]] reports detail the confiscation of Turkmen and Arab families' documents, preventing them from voting, buying property and travelling. Turkmen residents of Kirkuk were detained by Kurdish forces and compelled to leave the city. Kurdish authorities expelled hundreds of Arab families from the city, demolishing their homes in the process.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Iraq: Kirkuk Security Forces Expel Displaced Turkmen|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/05/07/iraq-kirkuk-security-forces-expel-displaced-turkmen|website=Human Rights Watch|date=7 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=KRG: Kurdish Forces Ejecting Arabs In Kirkuk|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/11/03/krg-kurdish-forces-ejecting-arabs-kirkuk|website=Human Rights Watch|date=3 November 2016}}</ref>

[[Sami Frashëri|Şemseddin Sâmi]] mentioned Kirkuk city in the Kâmûsü'l-A'lâm written in the late 19th century. And says "Kirkuk is located to the southeast of the [[Mosul vilayet]] in [[Kurdistan]], with a population of 30,000." then he says "The Kurds make up three-quarters of the people of Kirkuk, and the rest are Turks, Arabs, 760 Jews and 460 Chaldeans."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/kamus-ul-alam|title=Kâmûs-ül Â'lâm|accessdate=8 February 2024|via=Internet Archive}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=فيلسوف "الأبجدية التركية" يحسم مصير كركوك بـ"دليل" عمره 131 عاماً |url=https://www.kurdistan24.net/ar/story/18495-فيلسوف-%22الأبجدية-التركية%22-يحسم-مصير-كركوك-بـ%22دليل%22-عمره-131-عاماً |website=www.kurdistan24.net}}</ref>

Kirkuk's population was predominantly Turkmen in the early 20th century, when Turkish was the most common language spoken at home. The city had a population near 30,000 in the late 1910s. The Turkmen were majority in the city centre, dominating the political and economic life of the area.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=MacDonell|first=Joseph|title=Jesuits By The Tigris: Men for Others in Baghdad|year=1994|pages=82}}</ref>

The most reliable census concerning the ethnic composition of Kirkuk dates back to 1957. The Turkish-speaking [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmen]] formed the majority in the city of Kirkuk, whilst the Kurds were the plurality in the [[Kirkuk Governorate|governorate]]. The provincial borders were later altered, the province was renamed al-Ta'mim, and some Kurdish-majority districts were added to Erbil and Sulamaniya provinces.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2008/0425/p06s02-wome.html | title=Can the U.N. avert a Kirkuk border war? | date=25 April 2008 | agency=CS Monitor | access-date=2 August 2012 | author=Dagher, Sam}}</ref>

A report by the [[International Crisis Group]] points out that figures from the 1977 and 1997 censuses "are all considered highly problematic, due to suspicions of regime manipulation" because Iraqi citizens were only allowed to indicate belonging to either the Arab or Kurdish ethnic groups;<ref name="ICG">{{cite web|year=2008|title=Turkey and the Iraqi Kurds: Conflict or Cooperation?|url=http://www.genocidewatch.org/images/Iraq_08_11_13_Turkey_and_Iraqi_Kurds_Conflict_or_Cooperation.pdf|publisher=[[International Crisis Group]]|page=16|access-date=19 June 2018|quote=In Kirkuk governorate overall, the Kurds were the largest group (187,593), with the Arabs second (109,620) and the Turkomans third (83,371).

[[File:Kirkuk Demographical Map 2014.png|237px|right|thumb|Ethnic groups in Kirkuk and its environs in 2014, at the time of the capture of the area by Kurdish forces.]]

After attacks by ISIS, Kurdish authorities who were suspicious of the Arab refugees in Kirkuk, expelled hundreds of Arab families who had fled to the region during Iraq's war against ISIS. The refugees were sent to camps for the displaced or to their places of origin. Some of the displaced described themselves as locals and not as internally displaced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/11/iraq-kurdish-authorities-bulldoze-homes-and-banish-hundreds-of-arabs-from-kirkuk/|title = Iraq: Kurdish authorities bulldoze homes and banish hundreds of Arabs from Kirkuk|date = 7 November 2016}}</ref>

==== Arabs ====
The principal Arab extended families in the city of Kirkuk were: the [[Tikrit]]i and the [[Hadidi (tribe)|Hadidi]] ({{langx|ar|حديدي}}). The Tikriti family was the main [[Arab]] family in Kirkuk coming from [[Tikrit]] in the 17th century. Other [[Arab]] tribes who settled in Kirkuk during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Period are the [[Al-Ubaid (tribe)|Al-Ubaid]] ({{langx|ar|آل عبيد}}) and the [[Al-Jiburi]] ({{langx|ar|آل جبور}}). The Al-Ubaid came from just northwest of Mosul when they were forced out of the area by other Arab tribes of that region. They settled in the [[Hawija]] district in Kirkuk in 1805 during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Period.<ref>Book Bedouins, Part I: Mesopotamia, Syria, northern Iraq, Al-Ubaid, Author Max Oppenheim</ref>

====Assyrians====
{{See also|Citadel Christians}}

The Seleucid town, like many other [[Upper Mesopotamia]]n cities had a significant [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] population. Christianity was established among them in the 2nd century by the bishop Tuqrītā (Theocritos).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=BĒṮ SELŌḴ | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica | access-date=24 June 2014 | author=Morony, Michael | year=1989 | volume=IV | pages=188 | url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bet-selok}}</ref> During the Sasanian times the town became an important centre of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], with several of its bishops rising to the rank of Patriarch. Tensions among Christians and Zoroastrians led to a severe persecution of Christians during the reign of [[Shapur II]] (309–379 A.D.) as recorded in the Acts of the Persian Martyrs. Persecution resumed under [[Yazdegerd II]] in 445 A.D. who massacred thousands of them. Their situation greatly improved under the Sasanians in the following two centuries after the advent of a national Persian church of free of [[Byzantine]] influence, namely [[Nestorianism]].<ref name="Bosworth 1954 144">{{harvnb|Bosworth|1954|p=144}}</ref> Persecution resumed under [[Yazdegerd II]] in 445 A.D. who massacred thousands of them.

During the Ottoman period most of Kirkuk's Christians followed the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] whose bishop resided in the Cathedral of the Great Martyrion which dates back to the 5th century. The cathedral was however used as a powder storage and was blown up as the Ottomans retreated in 1918.<ref>{{harvnb|Bosworth|1954|p=145}}</ref>

The discovery of oil brought more Christians to Kirkuk, however they were also affected by the Arabization policy of the Baath Party.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2011|p=51}}</ref> Their numbers continued to plummet after the American invasion,<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2011|p=6}}</ref> and they occupy 4% of municipal offices, a percentage thought to be representative of their numbers in the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2011|p=161}}</ref>

They are ethnic Assyrians who speak their own dialect of [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and religiously follow the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] from Kirkuk who lived in or near the citadel, where they adopted the Turkish language from Iraqi Turkmen, especially during the [[Ottoman Empire]].

Jews had a long history in Kirkuk. Ottoman records show that in 1560 there were 104 Jewish homes in Kirkuk,<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Erdogru |first=M.

====Kurds====
Kirkuk is claimed by the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] as its capital, but they do not control the city or province, and Kirkuk is not part of the Kurdistan Region. The last reliable census shows that the Kurds constituted less than a third of Kirkuk's population.<ref>{{Cite web |title=UNPO: Kurdistan: Constitution of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region |url=https://unpo.org/article/538?id=538 |access-date=2020-12-12 |website=unpo.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/iraq/215-iraq-fixing-security-kirkuk | title=Iraq: Fixing Security in Kirkuk | date=15 June 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.dailysabah.com/columns/merve-sebnem-oruc/2017/10/05/the-fateful-question-in-iraq-of-who-owns-kirkuk | title=The fateful question in Iraq of who owns Kirkuk | website=[[Daily Sabah]] | date=5 October 2017 }}</ref>

The [[Baban]] family was a Kurdish family that, in the 18th and 19th centuries, dominated the political life of the province of [[Sharazor]], in present-day Iraqi Kurdistan. The first member of the clan to gain control of the province and its capital, Kirkuk, was Sulayman Beg. Enjoying almost full autonomy, the Baban family established Kirkuk as their capital. It was from this time that Kurds in Iraq began to view Kirkuk as their capital. This persisted even after the Babans moved their administration to the new town of Sulaymaniya, named after the dynasty's founder, in the late 18th century.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&q=encyclopedia+of+the+ottoman+empire ''Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire'', Baban Family Entry], p.70</ref>

[[Iraqi Turkmen|Iraqi Turkmens]] view the city as their capital, with the last reliable census showing the city of Kirkuk had a Turkmen majority.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mei.edu/publications/kirkuk-constitutional-promises-normalization-census-and-referendum-still-unfulfilled|title=Kirkuk: Constitutional Promises of Normalization, Census, and Referendum Still Unfulfilled|website=Middle East Institute|accessdate=8 February 2024}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thearabweekly.com/kirkuk-major-centre-iraqi-turkmen-culture|title=Kirkuk: A major centre of Iraqi Turkmen culture|accessdate=8 February 2024}}</ref>

In the city of Kirkuk, Turkmens reside in the neighborhoods of Tisin, Musalla, Korya, Baghdad Road, Sarıkahya, Şaturlu, Beyler, Piryadi, Almas, Arafa, Bulak, Çukur, İmam Abbas, Cırıt Square, Çay, 1 June and Beşiktaş. They are sparsely dispersed in other neighborhoods. It is also known that Christian Turkmens live in the neighborhoods of Şaturlu, Almas and Arafa in Kirkuk. There are many Turkmen villages around Kirkuk. These villages include Türkalan, Yayçı, Çardaklı, Kızılyar, Kümbetler, Bulova and [[Bashir, Iraq|Beşir]].<ref>{{Cite report |last=Merkezi (ORSAM) |first=Ortadoğu Araştırmaları |title=ORSAM Analysis 203, Bilgay Duman, The Situation of Turkmens and The Turkmen Areas After ISIS |url=https://www.academia.edu/40261120}}</ref>

The riverfront, the historical homes, alleyways, the old cemeteries, and the prevailing musical modes of Kirkuk historically belong to the Turkmen. The old names of most of the villages and districts in Kirkuk, as well as the prevalent trades and occupations, trace back to Turkmen families.<ref>{{cite web | title=Iraqi Turkmen: The Controversy of Identity and Affiliation| website=FES – Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung | date=1 August 2021 | url=https://www.ecoi.net/en/document/2060577.html | access-date=8 February 2024|author=Ali Taher Al-Hamoud}}</ref> 

The [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmen]] are believed to be descendants of numerous Turkic migration waves. The earliest arrivals date back to the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] and [[Abbasid]] eras, when they arrived as military recruits.<ref>Matthew Gordon, The Breaking of a Thousand Swords: A History of the Turkish Military of Samarra, A.H. 200-275/815-889 C.E., SUNY Press, 2001, p.1</ref> Considerable Turcoman settlement continued during the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] era when [[Tughril|Toghrul]] entered Iraq in 1055 with his army composed mostly of [[Oghuz Turks]]. Kirkuk remained under the control of the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] Empire for 63 years. However, the largest Turkic migration waves occurred during the four centuries of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule (1535–1919) when Turkish migrants from [[Anatolia]] were encouraged to settle in the region;<ref>{{citation |last=Taylor|first=Scott|year=2004|title=Among the Others: Encounters with the Forgotten Turkmen of Iraq|publisher=Esprit de Corps Books|page=31|isbn=978-1-895896-26-8}}</ref> indeed, it is largely from this period that modern Turkmens claim association with [[Anatolia]] and the modern [[Republic of Turkey|Turkish state]].<ref name="Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=17" />

In particular, following the conquest of Iraq by the Ottoman sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in 1535, Kirkuk came firmly under Ottoman control and was referred to “Gökyurt” (Blue Homeland) in the Ottoman records, "perhaps indicating that Kirkuk was identified as a particularly Turkic town by that time."<ref name="Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=17">{{citation |last1=Anderson|first1=Liam D.|last2=Stansfield|first2=Gareth R.

==Main sites==
Ancient architectural monuments of Kirkuk include:

* the [[Daniel in Islam|Prophet Daniel]]'s [[Tomb of Daniel|Tomb]]
* [[Kirkuk Citadel|the Kirkuk Citadel]]
* [[Qaysareyah of Kirkuk]]
* [[Qishla of Kirkuk|the ''Qishla'' of Kirkuk]]

The archaeological sites of Qal'at [[Jarmo]] and [[Yorgan Tepe]] are found at the outskirts of the modern city. In 1997, there were reports that the government of [[Saddam Hussein]] "demolished Kirkuk's historic citadel with its mosques and ancient church".<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iraq/2000/photo3.htm |title=Kirkuk Citadel |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |access-date=2013-03-26}}</ref>

The architectural heritage of Kirkuk sustained serious damage during [[World War I]] (when some pre-Muslim Assyrian Christian monuments were destroyed) and, more recently, during the [[Iraq War]]. [[Simon Jenkins]] reported in June 2007 that "eighteen ancient shrines have been lost, ten in Kirkuk and the south in the past month alone".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,2098272,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=In Iraq's four-year looting frenzy, the allies have become the vandals | first=Simon | last=Jenkins | date=7 June 2007}}</ref>

Dr. Daoud Shaker, head of the Iraqi weather bureau told the Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) snow fell in Baghdad during two hours in the morning on Friday after coming under the effect of two pressure systems, one cold originating from Siberia and the other warm coming from the sea. He said the temperature on Friday was "below zero in several Iraqi areas" resulting in snowfalls Thursday in several western areas. But the snowfall continued on Friday along with the low temperatures, he added. He predicted that the snowfalls and rain would subside as of Friday night paving the way for subzero temperatures in the next few days that could reach six degrees Celsius below zero specifically at night. He added that the snow that fell on Baghdad has melted. But in Kirkuk and several northern cities including Suleimaniah, snow fell again on Friday along with very low temperatures. According to weather sources, up to four millimeters of snow fell on Kirkuk Friday. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928003714/http://www.indianmuslims.info/news/2008/jan/11/iraq_under_cold_front_bringing_snow_and_below_zero_temperatures.html |archive-date=28 September 2013 }}</ref>
