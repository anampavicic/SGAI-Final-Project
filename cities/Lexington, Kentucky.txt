'''Lexington''' is a [[Consolidated city-county|consolidated city]] coterminous with and the [[county seat]] of [[Fayette County, Kentucky]], United States. As of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]] the city's population was 322,570, making it the [[List of cities in Kentucky|second-most populous city]] in Kentucky (after [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]), the 14th-most populous city in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], and the [[List of United States cities by population|59th-most populous city]] in the [[United States]]. By land area, it is the country's [[List of United States cities by area|30th-largest city]].

Lexington is known as the "Horse Capital of the World" due to the hundreds of [[Equine industry in Kentucky|horse farms]] in the region, as well as the [[Kentucky Horse Park]], [[The Red Mile]] and [[Keeneland]] race courses. It is within the state's [[Bluegrass region]]. Notable locations within the city include venues [[Rupp Arena]] and [[Central Bank Center]], colleges and universities such as the [[University of Kentucky]], [[Transylvania University]], and [[Bluegrass Community and Technical College]], and the [[National Thoroughbred Racing Association]] (NTRA) Headquarters.

The city anchors the [[Lexington–Fayette metropolitan area]] of 516,811 people and the greater [[Lexington–Fayette–Richmond–Frankfort combined statistical area]] of 747,919 people. It has been consolidated entirely within Fayette County since 1974 and has a nonpartisan mayor-council form of government, with 12 council districts and three members elected at large, with the highest vote-getter designated vice mayor.

{{Broader|History of Kentucky}}

Lexington was named in June 1775, in what was then considered [[Fincastle County, Virginia]], 17 years before [[Kentucky]] became a [[list of US states|state]]. A party of frontiersmen, led by William McConnell, camped on the Middle Fork of [[Elkhorn Creek (Kentucky)|Elkhorn Creek]] (now known as Town Branch and rerouted under Vine Street) at the site of the present-day [[McConnell Springs (springs)|McConnell Springs]]. Upon hearing of the colonists' victory in the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] on April 19, 1775, they named the site Lexington. It was the first of many American places to be named after the [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Massachusetts town]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YbyjamQWtScC&pg=PA16 |title=Our Storehouse of Missouri Place Names |publisher=University of Missouri Press |author=Ramsay, Robert L. |year=1952 |page=16 |isbn=9780826205865 |access-date=October 26, 2020 |archive-date=April 2, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240402052403/https://books.google.com/books?id=YbyjamQWtScC&pg=PA16#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref>

On January 25, 1780, 45 original settlers signed the Lexington Compact, known also as the "Articles of Agreement, made by the inhabitants of the town of Lexington, in the [[Kentucky County, Virginia|County of Kentucky]]."<ref>Of these 45 original co-founders, the most common surnames were Wymore (4) and Thompson (3), while Johnson, Niblack, Collins, McDonald, Lindsay, Shannon, Stevenson, and Martin have two signees per name. The Lexington "Articles of Agreement" can be found in the Pogue Library of Murray State University, Murray, KY.</ref> The settlement at Lexington at this time was also known as Fort Lexington, as it was surrounded by fortifications to protect from potential attacks from British-allied Indians. The Articles allocated land by granting "In" lots of 1/2 acre to each share, along with "Out" lots of 5 acres for each share. Presumably the "In" lots were for the family dwelling inside the fortifications, while the "Out" lots were to be "cleared" for farming. (Corn is the only crop specifically mentioned in the Articles.) It is known that several of these original settlers (perhaps many of them) served under General [[George Rogers Clark]] in the [[Illinois campaign]] (also called the Northwestern campaign) against the British in 1778–79.<ref>Paul L. Trovillion, Jr., ''A History and Genealogy of the Wymores of Southern Illinois,' pp. 1–4, 'Silver Horse: Paducah, KY, 1998.''</ref><ref>Copies of the full Lexington "Articles of Agreement" may be found in the Pogue Library, Murray State University, and in ''Fayette County, Kentucky Records'', Vol. 1: pp. 356–357, by Michael L. Cook, C.G. & Betty Cummings Cook, C.G. Cook Publications, 3318 Wimberg, Evansville, IN 47712.</ref> While the ostensible founder of Lexington, William McConnell, is not one of the signees, an Alexander McConnell is. Within two years of signing the Agreement, both John and Jacob Wymore were killed by Indians in separate incidents outside the walls of "Fort Lexington".<ref>Paul L. Trovillion, Jr., ''A History and Genealogy of the Wymores", p. 6.''</ref>

In December 1781, a huge caravan of around 600 pioneers from Spotsylvania County, Virginia—dubbed "The Travelling Church"—arrived in the Lexington area. Led by the preacher Lewis Craig and Captain William Ellis, the Travelling Church established numerous churches, including the South Elkhorn Christian Church in Lexington.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q6U-AAAAYAAJ&q=George+Washington+Ranck,+%27%27The+Traveling+Church |author=George Washington Ranck |title=The Travelling Church: An Account of the Baptist Exodus from Virginia to Kentucky in 1781 under the Leadership of Rev.

In the early 1800s, Lexington was a rising city of the vast territory to the west of the Appalachian Mountains; Josiah Espy described it in a published version of his notes as he toured Ohio and Kentucky:<ref>{{cite web |last1=Espy |first1=Josiah |title=Memorandums of a Tour in Ohio and Kentucky in 1805 |url=http://www.patphil.com/espy02.htm |website=Espy – Morehead, Phil and Pat |access-date=February 9, 2021 |archive-date=February 10, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210210051230/http://www.patphil.com/espy02.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>{{cquote|Lexington is the largest and most wealthy town in Kentucky, or indeed west of the Allegheny Mountains; the main street of Lexington has all the appearance of Market Street in Philadelphia on a busy day&nbsp;...

In the early 19th century, Lexington planter [[John Wesley Hunt]] became the first millionaire west of the Alleghenies. [[Henry Clay]], a lawyer who married into one of the wealthiest families of Kentucky and served as Speaker of the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1812, helped to lead the [[War Hawks]], pushing for war with Britain to bolster the markets of American products.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hammack |first1=James W.

The growing town was devastated by a [[Cholera epidemic in Lexington, Kentucky|cholera epidemic in 1833]], which had spread throughout the waterways of the Mississippi and Ohio valleys: 500 of 7,000 Lexington residents died within two months, including nearly one-third of the congregation of [[Christ Church Episcopal (Lexington Kentucky)|Christ Church Episcopal]].<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/lexington/cce.htm "Christ Church Episcopal"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628195201/http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/lexington/cce.htm |date=June 28, 2014 }}, Lexington, National Park Service.

Farmers in the areas around Lexington held slaves for use as field hands, laborers, artisans, and [[domestic servant]]s. In the city, slaves worked primarily as domestic servants and artisans, although they also worked with merchants, shippers, and in a wide variety of trades. Farms raised commodity crops of tobacco and hemp, and thoroughbred horse breeding and racing became established in this part of the state. By 1850, Lexington had the highest concentration of enslaved people in the entire state. The city also had a significant population of [[free people of color|free blacks]], who were often of mixed race. By 1850, First African Baptist Church, led by [[London Ferrill]], a free black from Virginia, had a congregation of 1,820 persons. At that time, First African Baptist Church had the largest congregation of any church, black or white, in the state of Kentucky.<ref name=Nutter/>

===20th century to present===
City school superintendent Massillon Alexander Cassidy (1886–1928) implemented [[Progressive Era]] reforms. He focused on upgrading the buildings and setting up teacher-training. He emphasized the need to improve literacy rates and expand access to public schooling. Cassidy's own philosophy stressed the use of science, business, and expertise. He also had a paternalistic attitude toward blacks, who were in segregated public schools.<ref>Richard E. Day and Lindsey N. DeVries. "A Southern Progressive: M. A. Cassidy and the Lexington Schools, 1886–1928." ''American Educational History Journal'' 39.1/2 (2012): 107–125.</ref>

Amidst the tensions between black and white populations over the lack of [[affordable housing]] in the city, a race riot broke out on September 1, 1917. At the time, the Colored A. & M. Fair (one of the largest African American fairs in the South) on Georgetown Pike had attracted more African Americans from the surrounding area into the city. Also during this time, some [[United States National Guard]] troops were camping on the edge of the city. Three troops passed in front of an African American restaurant and shoved some people on the sidewalk. A fight broke out, reinforcements for the troops and civilians both appeared, and soon a riot began. The [[Kentucky National Guard]] was summoned, and once the riot had ended, armed soldiers and police patrolled the streets. All other National Guard troops were barred from the city streets until the fair ended.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nkaa.uky.edu/nkaa/items/show/2069 |title=Race Riot of 1917 (Lexington, KY) |website=Notable Kentucky African Americans Database |access-date=February 5, 2020 |archive-date=February 5, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200205181736/https://nkaa.uky.edu/nkaa/items/show/2069 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On February 9, 1920, tensions flared up again, this time over the trial of [[Will Lockett]], a black man who murdered Geneva Hardman, a 10-year-old white girl. When a large mob gathered outside the courthouse where Lockett's trial was underway, Kentucky Governor [[Edwin P. Morrow]] massed the National Guard troops into the streets to work alongside local law enforcement. As the mob advanced on the courthouse, the National Guard opened fire, killing six and wounding 50 others. Fearing further retaliation from the mob, Morrow urged the [[United States Army]] to provide assistance. Led by Brigadier General [[Francis Marshall (U.S. Army officer)|Francis C. Marshall]], approximately 1,200 federal troops from nearby [[Camp Zachary Taylor]] moved into the city the same day to assist National Guard forces and local police in bringing order and peace. Marshall declared [[martial law]] in the city and had soldiers positioned throughout the area for two weeks. Lockett was eventually executed on March 11 at the [[Kentucky State Penitentiary]] in [[Eddyville, Kentucky|Eddyville]], after being found guilty of murdering Hardman.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Brackney |first=Peter |title=The Murder of Geneva Hardman and Lexington's Mob Riot of 1920 |pages=89–100, 103–120 |publisher=[[The History Press]] |date=January 20, 2020 |isbn=978-1-4671-4396-7}}</ref>

In 1935, during the [[Great Depression]], the Addiction Research Center (ARC) was created as a small research unit at the [[United States Public Health Service]] hospital in Lexington.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/NIDA_Notes/NNVol10N6/ARCHistory.html |title=History of the Addiction Research Center |publisher=Drugabuse.gov |date=May 15, 1935 |access-date=November 18, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825210041/http://drugabuse.gov/NIDA_Notes/NNVol10N6/ARCHistory.html |archive-date=August 25, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Founded as one of the first [[drug rehabilitation]] clinics in the nation, the ARC was affiliated with a federal prison. Expanded as the first alcohol and drug rehabilitation hospital in the United States, it was known as "Narco" of Lexington. The hospital was later converted to operate as part of the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|federal prison system]]; it is known as the [[Federal Medical Center, Lexington]] and serves a variety of health needs for prisoners. Lexington also served as the headquarters for a [[Pack Horse Library Project|pack horse library]] in the late 1930s and early 1940s.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13537685/ |title=Need in Kentucky |date=November 21, 1937 |work=The Indianapolis Star |access-date=September 3, 2017 |via=Newspapers.com |archive-date=April 2, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240402051740/https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-indianapolis-star/13537685/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Khp.jpg|thumb|left|Lexington's strict urban growth boundary protects area horse farms from development.]]

Lexington has had to manage a rapidly growing population while working to maintain the character of the surrounding horse farms that give the region its identity. In 1958, Lexington enacted the nation's first [[urban growth boundary]], restricting new development to an urban service area (USA). It set a minimum area requirement of {{cvt|40|acre|m2}} to maintain open space for landholdings in the rural service area.<ref name="GSAP">{{cite press release |title=\"Greenbrier Small Area Plan\" (PDF) |publisher=Lexington-Fayette Urban County, Kentucky |date=April 17, 2003 |url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0aBvWAKyfxaak41VHFzNHYwU0k/view |access-date=May 20, 2007 |format=PDF |archive-date=June 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622022225/https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0aBvWAKyfxaak41VHFzNHYwU0k/view |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1980, the comprehensive plan was updated: the USA was modified to include urban activity centers (UACs) and rural activity centers (RACs).<ref name="PlanningHistory">{{cite press release |title=Planning History |publisher=Lexington-Fayette Urban County, Kentucky |url=http://www.lfucg.com/planning/History.asp |access-date=May 20, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523152243/https://www.lfucg.com/planning/History.asp |archive-date=May 23, 2007}}</ref> The UACs were commercial and light-industrial districts in urbanized areas, while RACs were retail trade and light-industrial centers clustered around the [[Interstate 64]]/[[Interstate 75]] interchanges. In 1996, the USA was expanded when {{cvt|5300|acre|km2|0}} of the RSA were acquired through the expansion area master plan (EAMP).<ref name="GSAP"/> This was controversial: this first major update to the comprehensive plan in over a decade was accompanied by arguments among residents about the future of Lexington and the Thoroughbred farms.<ref name="PlanningHistory"/>

The EAMP included new concepts of impact fees, assessment districts, neighborhood design concepts, design overlays, mandatory [[greenway (landscape)|greenways]], major roadway improvements, storm water management, and open-space mitigation for the first time. It also included a draft of the rural land management plan, which included large-lot zoning and traffic-impact controls. A pre-zoning of the entire expansion area was refuted in the plan. A {{cvt|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} minimum proposal was defeated. Discussion of this proposal appeared to stimulate the development of numerous {{cvt|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} subdivisions in the RSAs.<ref name="PlanningHistory"/>

Three years after the expansion was initiated, the RSA land management plan was adopted, which increased the minimum lot size in the agricultural rural zones to {{cvt|40|acre|m2}}.<ref name="GSAP"/> In 2000, a purchase of development rights plan was adopted, granting the city the power to purchase the development rights of existing farms; in 2001, $40&nbsp;million was allocated to the plan from a $25&nbsp;million local, $15&nbsp;million state grant.<ref name="PlanningHistory"/>

The city is home to two [[horse-racing]] tracks, [[Keeneland]] and [[The Red Mile]] harness track. Keeneland, sporting live races in April and October, is steeped in tradition; little has changed since the track's opening in 1936. Keeneland hosted the [[2015 Breeders' Cup]], with the event's signature race, the [[Breeders' Cup Classic]], won by [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)|Triple Crown]] winner [[American Pharoah]]. This track also has the world's largest Thoroughbred auction house; 19 [[Kentucky Derby]] winners, 21 [[Preakness Stakes]] winners, and 18 [[Belmont Stakes]] winners were purchased at Keeneland sales. Its most notable race is the [[Blue Grass Stakes]], which is considered an important preparation for the Kentucky Derby. The Red Mile is the oldest horse racing track in the city and the second-oldest in the nation. It runs live [[harness racing|harness races]], in which horses pull two-wheeled carts called sulkies.

The [[Kentucky Horse Park]], located along scenic [[Kentucky Route 1973|Iron Works Pike]] in northern Fayette County, is a comparative latecomer to Lexington, opening in 1978. Although commonly known as a tourist attraction and museum, it is also a working horse farm with a [[farrier]] and famous retired horses such as 2003 Kentucky Derby winner [[Funny Cide]]. Since its opening in April 1978, the Kentucky Horse Park has hosted the [[Rolex Kentucky Three Day]] Event, which is one of the top-three annual equestrian [[eventing]] competitions in the world and is held immediately before the [[Kentucky Derby]] at [[Churchill Downs]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]].

===Law enforcement===
Primary law enforcement duties within Lexington-Fayette County are the responsibility of the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government Division of Police. As of July 1, 2021, the Division of Police (also called Lexington Police Department) is authorized for 639 sworn police officers and 16 traffic safety officers. The Division of Police resulted from the merger of the Lexington Police Department with the Fayette County Patrol in 1974. The Fayette County Sheriff's Office is responsible for court service, including court security, prisoner transport, process and warrant service, and property tax collection. The 1974 merger also consolidated the office of city jailer into the office of county jailer, a constitutional position. In 1992 (effective 1993), the Kentucky General Assembly enabled a correctional services division to be established by ordinance, making employees civil-service employees rather than political appointees.<ref>KRS 67A.028</ref>

===Fire protection===
All fire/rescue protection within Lexington-Fayette County (with the exception of the [[Blue Grass Airport]]) is provided by the [[Lexington Fire Department]]. The current department was formed with the merger of the county and city fire departments in 1973. Lexington Fire Department is the largest single fire department in Kentucky with over 600 personnel and 24 individual fire stations broken into five districts (battalions).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lexington |url=https://www.kentuckyfiretrucks.com/Photos/Lexington |access-date=September 1, 2020 |website=www.kentuckyfiretrucks.com |archive-date=February 28, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210228041901/https://www.kentuckyfiretrucks.com/Photos/Lexington |url-status=live }}</ref>
