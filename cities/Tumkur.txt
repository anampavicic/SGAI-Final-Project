==Etymology==
Etymologically, the name of the city is believed to have been mutated possibly from "Tumbe ooru" because of the abundance of thumbe hoovu, a kind of flower, or thamate ooru because of the folk musical percussion instrument thamate, that might have been used most here. It is also called ''Kalpatharu Nadu'' (land of coconut trees), due to the abundance of coconut trees in the area.<ref name="nickname">{{Cite web|title=About Tumkur, the land of education {{!}} SSDC|url=https://www.ssdctumkur.org/about-tumkur.html|access-date=31 December 2020|website=www.ssdctumkur.org}}</ref>

Another story says that during the rule of cholas Gulur was their capital. Since Tumkur is at high elevation the guards used to be there on any hill with tumaki (a kind of drum) and used to make sound in case of any alerts, hence the name. The Indian central government approved the request to officially rename the Tumkur and 12 other cities in October 2014. The city officially became "Tumakuru" on 1 November 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last1=New City|first1=Names to Karnatka|title=New name for cities|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/from-bangalore-to-bengaluru/article6553314.ece|access-date=1 November 2014|newspaper=The Hindu}}</ref>
