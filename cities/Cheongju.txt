'''Cheongju''' ({{Korean|hangul=청주}}; {{IPA|ko|tɕʰʌŋ.dʑu}}) is the capital and largest [[List of cities in South Korea|city]] of [[North Chungcheong Province]] in South Korea.

==History==
Cheongju has been an important provincial town since ancient times. In the Cheongju Mountains, particularly in the area where Sangdang Sanseong is located, ruins dating from the Old Stone Age to the Bronze Age have been discovered.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ch'a |first=Yong-gŏl |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9xgqAQAAIAAJ&q=Cheongju+Historical |title=Mountain Fortresses in Central Inland Korea: Sangdang Sanseong Mountain Fortress |date=2007 |publisher=Korea Fortress Academy |isbn=978-89-961732-2-9 |language=en}}</ref> Settlements associated with the Paleolithic Age have also been found in Cheongju, such as the Durubong Cave Site.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |title=The Beginnings of Korea's History (Prehistoric Times – Gojoseon) |url=https://www.korea.net/AboutKorea/History/The-Beginnings-of-the-Countrys-History |access-date=2022-10-30 |website=[[Korea.net]] |language=en}}</ref>

After the unification of the kingdoms by Silla in 676, various parts of Korea, including Cheongju, began to adopt Buddhism. This was influenced by the Silla culture's connection with the Silk Road, which facilitated the spread of Buddhism from Nepal across Northern China to the Korean Peninsula.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=Sang-cheul |first=Choe |date=2002 |title=Creating Cultural Identity for Sustainable Urban Development A Case Study of the City of Cheongju in Korea |url=https://s-space.snu.ac.kr/bitstream/10371/90613/1/1.Creating_Cultural_Identity_for_Sustainable_Urban_Development_A_Case_Study_of_the_City_of_Cheongju_in_Korea.pdf |access-date=2022-10-31 |website=[[Seoul National University]]}}</ref> During the Goryeo era, particularly during the reign of Gwangjong, several monuments related to Buddhism were created. Among them is Cheol Danggan, built in the year 962 in the center of the city near the remains of Yongdu Temple. Cheol Danggan is a flagpole used to hang the Dang flag, which is raised to pay tribute to Buddha.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last= |date=2017-06-01 |title=El proyecto de renovación de una plaza iluminará un asta medieval de una ciudad surcoreana |url=https://sp.yna.co.kr/view/ASP20170601002100883 |access-date=2022-10-30 |website=[[Yonhap News Agency]] |language=es}}</ref> It was listed as a National Treasure in 1962 by the South Korean government.<ref name=":0" /> In the Joseon period, the Cheongju region began to adopt Confucianism as its main religion.<ref name=":1" />

Throughout the history of Cheongju, various temples were established during different periods in the history of the Korean peninsula.

In 1593, the Battle of Cheongju took place between Japanese forces and the Joseon kingdom that then ruled the Korean peninsula during the [[Hideyoshi's Invasions of Korea]], in which more than 8,000 Korean warrior monks participated.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Shields |first=Steven |date=2020-08-18 |title=[RAS Korea] Cheongju: a historical and cultural gem |url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2022/10/177_294476.html |access-date=2022-10-29 |website=[[The Korea Times]] |language=en}}</ref>

The government of the province relocated here from [[Chungju]] in 1908. The opening of the Chungbuk-line in 1926 sparked regional development. In 1946, Cheongju and Cheongwon-gun were separated, and in 1949, Cheongju was upgraded to Cheongju City. Afterwards, it went through the separation of administrative dong and their transfer to Cheongwon-gun, with 2 branch offices (East and West) established in July 1989 that were upgraded to Sangdang-gu and Heungdeok-gu in January.<ref>[http://english.cjcity.net/about/history-01p.asp * Welcome to Cheongju-Si Homepage *<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623083613/http://english.cjcity.net/about/history-01p.asp |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref>

Cheongju experienced one of the largest population growths in Korea, having almost quadrupled its population from 147,000 in 1970 to 582,158 in 2000.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Nadarajah |first1=M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jd2yAAAAIAAJ&q=%22It+is+one+of+the+most+rapidly+growing+cities+in+Korea+:+its%22 |title=Urban Crisis: Culture and the Sustainability of Cities |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Ann Tomoko |date=2007 |publisher=United Nations University Press |isbn=978-92-808-1125-4 |language=en}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Stad Cheongju.jpg|thumb|Cityscape of Cheongju]]
[[Geum River]] goes through the center of Cheongju city. Additionally, the tributaries of Musim and Miho flow together in the northern part of the city. To the east and west, there are the mountains of Wuam and Bumo. [[Musimcheon River]] also goes through the middle of Cheongju city.

===Climate===
Cheongju is a temperate zone, so there are four seasons. The climate is a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dwa''), but can be considered a borderline [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cwa'') using the {{convert|-3|C}} isotherm.

==Government and infrastructure==
The headquarters of the [[Ministry of Food and Drug Safety]] are located in the Osong Health Technology Administration Complex.

==Cultural properties==
*'''Sangdangsanseong''' (Sangdang Mountain Fortress) lies on the slopes of Mt. Uam within the city limits.  The fortress is mainly a {{convert|3|to(-)|4|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off|-tall}} wall that stretches over {{convert|4.2|km|mi|1|abbr=off}} in circumference.  The present walls date to the 1716 restoration of the site.  Within the walls lies a small tourist village that has several restaurants.
*'''Cheongju National Museum''' also lies near Mt. Uam, and houses several exhibits of cultural artifacts from the nearby area.
*'''[[Heungdeoksa Temple Site]]''' is the home to the [[Cheongju Early Printing Museum|Early Printing Museum]], and is to be the site of the printing of [[Jikji]], the oldest existent book printed using movable metal type.  The museum itself contains exhibits related to the art of printing through the ages.
*'''Yongdusaji Cheoldanggan''' (The Iron Flagpole of the Yongdu Temple Site) is designated Korean National Treasure number 41, and is located near Lotte Department Store in downtown Cheongju.  Made of twenty iron cylinders, the flagpole stands {{convert|13.1|m|ft|1|abbr=off}} tall, and was formerly used to hang flags to honour the Buddha.
*'''National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art – Cheongju''' (MMCA Cheongju) which is scheduled to open in December 2018, will be the first museum in Korea to open its conservation center to the general public. Notably, MMCA Cheongju is being constructed within a renovated tobacco factory, which once played a major role in Korea's modern industry. The new building has been especially designed to use energy more efficiently and thus reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As such, the new museum will be a high-profile example of a project combining elements of urban revitalization and historical preservation.
*'''Chojeonghaenggung''' (Chojeong Temporary Palace) is a temporary palace where [[Sejong the Great|King Sejong]] stayed for treatment of an eye disease. It is said that King Sejong completed the creation of Hangul here. This place was destroyed during the Joseon Dynasty, and restoration work began in December 2017, and construction was completed in December 2019. It opened in June 2020. Also, Chojeong Mineral Water produced near here is quite famous carbonated water. It is known that King Sejong also tried to treat an eye disease with carbonated water produced in Chojeong. Chojeonghaenggung is located in Naesu-eup, Cheongwon District.

==Transport==
[[Cheongju International Airport]] provides scheduled flights within Korea and to China. The main train station is located at [[Ogeunjang Station|Ogeunjang]] approximately {{convert|8|km|abbr=on}} north of the city hall. This station is on the [[Chungbuk Line]].
[[Gagyeong Terminal|Cheongju Bus Terminal]] provides almost all of the bus lines to bus terminals located in other cities. Ticketing time is between 4:00&nbsp;am and 11:40&nbsp;pm.
[[Gagyeong Terminal|Cheongju Express Bus Terminal]] provides some bus lines for Seoul (Gangnam, Sangbong, South Seoul, East Seoul, Busan, East Deagu, Gwangju).

In 2023, the Cheongju tunnel flooded during the [[2023 South Korean floods|annual monsoon]] which trapped 15 vehicles and resulted in at least 7 deaths and 11 reported missing.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Many dead in S Korea as flash floods trap 15 vehicles in tunnel |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/16/many-dead-in-s-korea-as-flash-floods-trap-15-vehicles-in-tunnel |date=2023-07-16 |website=www.aljazeera.com |language=en}}</ref>
