'''Unaizah''' ({{langx|ar|عنيزة}} {{transliteration|ar|DIN|ʿUnaizah}}) or officially The '''Governorate of Unaizah''' (also spelled Onaizah, Onizah, or Unayzah; {{langx|ar|محافظة عنيزة}} {{transliteration|ar|DIN|Muḥāfiẓat ʿUnaizah}}) is a Saudi Arabian city in the [[Al-Qassim Province|Al Qassim Province]]. It lies south of the province capital [[Buraydah]] and north of [[Riyadh]], the capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It is the second largest city in Al-Qassim Province with a population of 184,600 (2022 census).<ref>{{cite web|archive-date=21 June 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230621214318/https://portal.saudicensus.sa/portal/public/1/15/1367?type=DASHBOARD|title=الهيئة العامة للإحصاء {{!}} تعداد السعودية|url=https://portal.saudicensus.sa/portal/public/1/15/101460?type=TABLE}}<!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --></ref>

Historically, Unaizah was an important stopping point for Muslim pilgrims coming from Mesopotamia (now Iraq) and Persia (now Iran) on their way to [[Makkah]]. Many scientists and historians believe that Unaizah was inhabited hundreds of years before the spread of [[Islam]], citing its reference in numerous poems from some of the most important poets of pre-Islamic Arabia such as [[Imru' al-Qais]].

==Geography==
Unaizah is in the south of [[Al-Qassim Province]] and at the heart of the historical region of [[Najd]]. It is located roughly 30 kilometers from [[Buraydah]] (the capital of the province) and more than 300 kilometers north of the Saudi capital, [[Riyadh]]. Unaizah lies in the northern-central region of the [[Najd]] and to the south of the [[Wadi al-Rummah]] (Rumma Valley), which is the longest [[valley]] on the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. It is surrounded by [[sand dunes]] to its north and west, which are known locally as the Al-Ghamis Sands. The Al-Ghadha Woods are located to the north of the city. Next to Unaizah is the Al-Aushaziyah [[salt lake]] (or Sabkha), which is considered an official part of the city.

===Climate===
Unaizah has a hot desert climate (Köppen Climate Classification BWh), with long, extremely hot summers and short, very mild winters. The average high temperature in August is {{cvt|43.6|°C}}. The city experiences very little precipitation, especially in summer, but receives a fair amount of rain in March and April. It is also known to have dust storms during which the dust can be so thick that visibility is under {{cvt|10|m}}.

==Agriculture==
[[Image:Palm Trees in Unaizah.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Palm trees in Unaizah]]
[[Image:Leeks farm in Unaizah.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Leeks ([[kurrat]]) farm in Unaizah]]
[[Image:Unaizah International Dates Festival.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A section in Unaizah International Dates Festival 08]]

Unaizah is an agricultural area and produces [[wheat]] and [[barley]] of various strains. The region also grows [[grape]]s, [[grapefruit]]s, [[lemon]]s, [[leek]]s, [[Mandarin orange|mandarins]], [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[pomegranate]]s and [[Date (fruit)|dates]].

[[Leek]]s ([[kurrat]]) are a very important part of the local culture of Unaizah. They are popular among the locals and comprise a significant portion of the local agricultural industry.

An annual Date Season Festival has been held in September since the early 2000s, giving Unaizah the distinction of hosting the second largest date festival in the [[Persian Gulf]] and the Middle East. The festival rivals the date festival of neighboring Buraydah's, which is sometimes known as "Buraydah, the City of Dates".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plQDYtTYyFI |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211213/plQDYtTYyFI |archive-date=2021-12-13 |url-status=live|title=YouTube video تقرير قناة الجزيرة عن مهرجان تمور عنيزة الرابع 1429 هــ|website=[[YouTube]] }}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name="2017-09-25_Slate">[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/roads/2017/09/unaizah_date_market_the_world_s_second_largest_date_festival_can_teach_us.html Hot Dates in the Saudi Desert -- The world’s second-largest date festival shifts into high gear.], Andrew Leber, [[Slate.com]], 2017-09-25</ref>

Unaizah's 2008 (4th) annual Date Festival was known as the "Unaizah International Date Festival", though the city's title "Unaizah, the Kingdom of Dates" was retained as a motto. Many people from different places of the Middle East come to see this festival and buy dates because they know there is a good quality of dates.

==Government==
[[File:Unaizah Municipality logo.jpg|thumb|right|Unaizah Municipality logo]]
The '''Unaizah Municipality''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: بلدية عنيزة or '''[[baladiyah]]''' [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: البلدية ) was founded in {{AH|1381}} in Unaizah. It carries out the [[Local government|civic administration]] for the Metropolitan area of Unaizah.

==Education==
Unaizah is home to some pioneers in [[education]]; the first [[Saudi people|Saudi]] person from [[Al-Qassim Province]] to earn a [[PhD.]] degree was from Unaizah, and his name was Abdulaziz Al-Khowaiter.<ref>[http://www.alriyadh.com/2009/03/15/article415934.html الكنز الثمين في شخصية د. عبدالعزيز الخويطر]</ref> The first [[Saudi people|Saudi]] female from [[Al Qassim Province]] to earn a PhD degree was also raised in this city.  Her name was Ebtisam Al Bassam.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unaizah.net/showthread.php?t=34224|title=علم من أعلام عنيزة في اليونسكو .. د. ابتسام البسام|website=www.unaizah.net}}</ref>

One of the first cities to embrace female education in [[Al-Qassim Province]] and [[Najd]] was Unaizah. It faced resistance from neighboring provinces and brought Unaizah at the forefront of a national debate. After lengthy negotiations, the capital city of Qassim, [[Buraidah]] a sister city of Unaizah, officially recognized the right of an education for females, partly due to [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|King Abdulaziz]]'s interference in settling the dispute.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alsaha.com/sahat/4/topics/113760|title=جريدة دولية تتحدث عن تسامح عـنيزة وتطرف بريدة|access-date=2009-10-03|archive-date=2010-11-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115061941/http://www.alsaha.com/sahat/4/topics/113760|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Today, there are many [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] in Unaizah for all three educational levels (primary, intermediate, and secondary). There are also two [[private schools]] and one private [[international school]]. There is also a boys' technological secondary school in the city and a technological college, as well as a girls' educational college. [[Qassim University]] is located approximately 30 kilometers north of the city, and enrolls both males and females.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.onaizahgedu.gov.sa/news/news.asp |title=ادارة التربية والتعليم للبنات بمحافظة عنيزة |access-date=2009-10-03 |archive-date=2010-02-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211162248/http://www.onaizahgedu.gov.sa/news/news.asp |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Western travelers==
The people of Unaizah are well known for their hospitality and acceptance for people from other races and religions. The famous [[Charles Montagu Doughty]] lived in the city during his odyssey and wrote highly about the city.

[[Amin al-Rihani]] (the famous [[France|Franco]]-[[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] scholar and traveler) spoke highly of the city's architecture and works of art in his book "[[Kings of Arabia]]" likening it to Paris thereby coining the nickname "Paris of Najd" for the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unaizah.net/showthread.php?t=20544|title=عنيزة ...باريــــــس نجــــد ...وإعجاب أمين الريحاني|website=www.unaizah.net}}</ref>

==Tourism==

There are twelve tourist [[festivals]] and activities recognized by the [[Saudi Commission for Tourism & Antiquities]], and a calendar has been made for these events.

Although Unaizah is thought to be relatively more accepting of visitors than its neighbors, its tourism industry faces criticism for a number of reasons.
