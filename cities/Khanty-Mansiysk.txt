'''Khanty-Mansiysk''' ({{lang-rus|Ха́нты-Манси́йск|Khánty-Mansíysk}}, lit. ''Khanty-Mansi Town''; [[Khanty language|Khanty]]: {{lang|kca|Ёмвоҷ}}, ''Jomvoćś''; [[Mansi language|Mansi]]: {{lang|mns|Абга}}, ''Abga'') is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] in west-central [[Russia]]. Technically, it is situated on the eastern bank of the [[Irtysh River]], {{convert|15|km|sp=us}} from its [[confluence]] with the [[Ob River|Ob]], in the [[oil boom|oil-rich]] region of [[Western Siberia]]. Though it is an [[independent city]], Khanty-Mansiysk also functions as the [[administrative centre]] of [[Khanty-Mansiysky District]], and the administrative center of [[Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug–Yugra]].

With 101,466 estimated inhabitants, Khanty-Mansiysk is among Russia's few regional capitals that are not the largest cities in their surrounding area, as it is surpassed in population by [[Surgut]], [[Nizhnevartovsk]] and [[Nefteyugansk]].

==Etymology==
Khanty-Mansiysk is a hyphenated word combining the names of two [[Lists of indigenous peoples of Russia|Russian indigenous peoples]] local to the region, the [[Khanty]] and the [[Mansi people|Mansi]], ending in "-''sk''" as is typical for the names of Russian towns, which means city. Before 1940, the settlement's name was Ostyako-Vogulsk, as these tribes were previously known as the Ostyaks and the Voguls, respectively.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Khanty-Mansiysk experiences a [[subarctic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfc''). The climate is extreme, with temperatures as low as {{convert|-49|C}} and as high as {{convert|+34.5|C}}. On average, however, the region is very cold, with an average temperature of {{convert|-1.1|C}}. Precipitation tends to be fairly low; {{convert|553|mm|sp=us}} per year, which is heavier in the summer than in the winter. The average [[Beaufort scale|wind speed]] is {{convert|2.4|m/s|sp=us}}, and the average [[Relative humidity|humidity]] is 77%.
