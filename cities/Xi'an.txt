{{anchor|Toponymy|Etymology|Names}}

== Name ==
"Xi'an" is the [[Standard Chinese phonology|atonal]] [[pinyin]] [[Romanization of Chinese|romanization]] of its Chinese name {{linktext|lang=zh|西安}}, ''Western Peace''. (The apostrophe – known in Chinese as a {{linktext|lang=zh-Hant|隔音符號}}, ''géyīn fúhào'' – should be included to distinguish its pronunciation from the single syllable ''xian''.) The name was adopted in 1369 under the early [[Ming dynasty]]. [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries]] recorded its name as {{nowrap|"'''Si-ngan'''"}} or '''"Si-ngan-fou"'''<ref>{{harvp|Du Halde|1736|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/descriptiongog01duha#page/220/mode/2up 220–1]}}; {{harvp|Du Halde|1741|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/generalhistoryof01duha#page/226/mode/2up 227–8]}}</ref> from its status as the seat of a [[fu (administrative division)|prefecture]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|府}},{{nbsp}}''fǔ''). This form still appears in the Latin name of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Xi'an|Catholic diocese of Xi'an]], {{lang|la|archidioecesis Singanensis}}. The name was later romanized as {{nowrap|"'''Hsi-an'''"}} by [[Wade-Giles|Wade & Giles]] and as "'''Sianfu'''"<ref>{{harvp|Stanford|1917|p=[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924023258241#page/n45/mode/2up/ 13] & [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924023258241#page/n79/mode/2up Index, p. 11]}}</ref> or "'''Sian'''"<ref name="br"/> by the [[Chinese postal romanization|imperial post office]], both of which were common until the promulgation of pinyin.

The area of present-day Xi'an has been the site of several important former Chinese cities. The capital of the [[Western Zhou dynasty|Western Zhou]] were the [[twin cities]] of '''[[Fengjing (Zhou)|Feng]]''' and '''[[Haojing|Hao]]''', known collectively as '''[[Fenghao]]''', located on opposite banks of the Feng River at its confluence with the southern bank of the [[Wei River|Wei]] in the western suburbs of present-day Xi'an.<ref>{{citation|script-title=zh:《中国古今地名大词典》|trans-title=The Big Dictionary of Old and Current Chinese Placenames |date=2005 |location=Shanghai |publisher=Shanghai Cishu Chubanshe |page=1540}}</ref> The [[state of Qin|Qin]] capital [[Xianyang]] was erected north of the Wei during the [[Warring States period]] and was succeeded by the [[Western Han]] capital of '''[[Chang'an]]''' ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hant|長安}}), meaning "Perpetual Peace", which was located south of the Wei and covered the central area of present-day Xi'an. During the [[Eastern Han]], Chang'an was also known as  the "Western Capital" ({{linktext|lang=zh|西|京|p=xijing}}), named for its namesake position relative to the main capital at [[Luoyang]]. Under the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]], its name became '''Daxing''' ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hant|大|興}}, "Greatly Prosperous") in AD 581. Under the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]], the name reverted to Chang'an in 618.<ref name="br">{{Cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/542532/Xian |title=Xi'an |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|access-date=2008-09-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204121315/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/542532/Xian|archive-date=December 4, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> Under the [[Mongol Empire|Mongolian]] [[Yuan dynasty]] (13th & 14th centuries), it held a succession of names: '''Fengyuan''' {{nowrap|({{linktext|lang=zh|奉|元}}),}} '''Anxi''' {{nowrap|({{linktext|lang=zh|安西}},}} "Peaceful West") and '''[[Jingzhao]]''' {{nowrap|({{linktext|lang=zh|京|兆}}).}} The Ming name "Xi'an" was changed back to Xijing ("Western Capital", as above) between 1930 and 1943.

===Ancient era===
[[File:Western Zhou dynasty Carriages pit2 Xi'an.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Remains of carriages and horses in [[Fenghao]] during the [[Western Zhou]] (11th–8th cent.{{nbsp}}BC)]]

Xi'an became a cultural and political center of China in the 11th century BC with the founding of the [[Zhou dynasty]]. The capital of Zhou was established in the twin settlements of Fengjing ({{lang|zh-hant|灃京}}) and [[Haojing]] ({{lang|zh-hant|鎬京}}), together known as [[Fenghao]], located southwest of contemporary Xi'an. The settlement was also known as Zōngzhōu (宗周) to indicate its role as the capital of the [[Ancient Chinese states|vassal states]].<ref>Third scroll of the ''Chang'an Annals'' (长安志) interpreted by [[Huangfu Mi]] in his ''Age of the Kings (book)'' (帝王世紀)</ref> In 738 BC, [[King Ping of Zhou]] moved the capital to [[Luoyang]] due to [[King Xie of Zhou|political unrest]].<ref>2011年上海中西书局出版《[[Tsinghua Bamboo Slips|清华大学藏战国竹简]]》（贰）：周幽王取妻于西申，生平王，王或（又）取褒人之女，是褒姒，生伯盘。褒姒嬖于王，王与伯盘逐平王，平王走西申。幽王起师，回（围）平王于西申，申人弗畀，曾人乃降西戎，以攻幽王，幽王及伯盘乃灭，周乃亡。邦君、诸正乃立幽王之弟余臣于虢，是携惠王。立廿又一年，晋文侯仇乃杀惠王于虢。周亡王九年，邦君诸侯焉始不朝于周，晋文侯乃逆平王于少鄂，立之于京师。三年，乃东徙，止于成周，晋人焉始启于京师，郑武公亦正东方之诸侯。</ref><ref>《[[Zuo Zhuan|左传]]·僖公二十二年》:初，平王之东迁也，辛有适伊川，见被发而祭于野者，曰:"不及百年，此其戎乎！其礼先亡矣。"秋，秦、晋迁陆浑之戎于伊川。</ref>

In 202 BC, the founding emperor [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]] of the [[Han dynasty]] established his capital in Chang'an County; his first palace, Changle Palace ({{lang|zh-hant|長樂宮}}, "Perpetual Happiness") was built across the river from the ruin of the Qin capital. This is traditionally regarded as the founding date of Chang'an. Two years later, Liu Bang built [[Weiyang Palace]] ({{lang|zh-hant|未央宮}}, "Never Ending Palace") north of modern Xi'an.

In 582, shortly after the [[Sui dynasty]] was founded, the emperor of Sui ordered a new capital to be built southeast of the Han capital, called Daxing (大興, "Great prosperity"). It consisted of three sections: the Imperial City, the palace section, and the civilian section, with a total area of {{convert|84|km2|abbr=on}} within the city walls. At the time, it was the largest city in the world. The city was renamed Chang'an by the [[Tang dynasty]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huaxia.com/gd/csdh/xa/2006/00459499.html |script-title=zh:西安历史 |language=zh-cn |access-date=2011-02-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211123827/http://www.huaxia.com/gd/csdh/xa/2006/00459499.html|url-status=live|archive-date=2011-02-11}}</ref> In the mid-7th century, after returning from his pilgrimage to India, the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk [[Xuanzang]] established a translation school for [[Sanskrit]] scriptures.

Chang'an was devastated at the end of the Tang dynasty in 904. Residents were forced to move to the new capital city in [[Luoyang]], and a small area in the city continued to be occupied thereafter.

For the over 200 years they lived next to each other, Han civilians and Manchu bannermen of both genders in Xi'an did not intermarry with each other at all. The Qing dynasty altered its law on intermarriage between Han civilians and Manchu bannermen several times in the dynasty. At the beginning of the Qing dynasty, the Qing allowed Han civilians to marry Manchu women. Then the Qing banned civilians from marrying women from the Eight banners later. In 1865, the Qing allowed Han civilian men to marry Manchu bannerwomen in all garrisons, except the capital garrison of Beijing. There was no formal law on marriage between people in the different banners, like the Manchu and Han banners, but it was informally regulated by social status and custom. In northeastern China, such as Heilongjiang and Liaoning, it was more common for Manchu women to marry Han men, since they were not subjected to the same laws and institutional oversight as Manchus and Han in Beijing and elsewhere.<ref>https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol38/34/38-34.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230405203748/https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol38/34/38-34.pdf |date=April 5, 2023 }} Demographic Research Volume 38, Article 34, Pages 929-966 Published 9 March 2018 http://www.demographic-research.org/Volumes/Vol38/34/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230416052619/https://www.demographic-research.org/Volumes/Vol38/34/ |date=April 16, 2023 }} DOI: 10.4054/DemRes.2018.38.34 Research Article Interethnic marriage in Northeast China, 1866–1913 Bijia Chen Cameron Campbell Hao Dong p 937</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Meibei Lake,Huyi District,Xi'an.jpg|thumb|Meibei Lake, [[Huyi District]], Xi'an]]
Xi'an lies on the [[Guanzhong|Guanzhong Plain]] in the south-central part of [[Shaanxi]] province, on a flood plain created by the eight surrounding rivers and streams.

The city borders the northern foot of the [[Qin Mountains]] (Qinling) to the south, and the banks of the [[Wei River]] to the north. [[Mount Hua|Hua Shan]], one of the five sacred Taoist mountains, is located {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} away to the east of the city. Not far to the north is the [[Loess Plateau]].

[[File:Txu-oclc-10552568-ni49-5.jpg|left|thumb|Map including Xi'an (labeled HSI-AN (SIAN) (walled)) ([[Army Map Service|AMS]], 1955)]]
At the beginning of Han dynasty, the Chief of Staff [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]] advised the emperor [[Liu Bang]] to choose Guanzhong as the capital of the Han dynasty: "Guanzhong Plain is located behind [[Mount Xiao]] and [[Hangu Pass]], and connects Long ([[Gansu]]) and Shu ([[Sichuan]]). The area can be called an irony castle spreads for thousands of miles, and is rich in harvest like the nation of heaven." ({{lang|zh-hans|关中左崤函，右陇蜀，沃野千里，此所谓金城千里，天府之国也}}) Since then, Guanzhong is also known as the 'Nation of the Heaven'.<ref>{{lang|zh-Hans|《史记·留侯世家》}}{{full citation needed|date=May 2020}}</ref>

==Climate==

Xi'an has a [[temperateness|temperate]] climate that is influenced by the [[East Asian monsoon]], classified under the [[Köppen climate classification]] as a borderline [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] and [[humid continental climate]] (''Cwa/Dwa''). The Wei River valley is characterized by hot, [[Humidity|humid]] summers, cold, dry winters, and dry springs and autumns. Most of the annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is delivered from July to late October. Snow occasionally falls in winter but rarely settles for long. [[Dust storm]]s often occur during March and April as the city rapidly warms up. Summer months also experience frequent but short [[thunderstorm]]s. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from around the freezing mark in January to {{convert|27.0|°C|1}} in July, with an annual mean of {{convert|14.08|°C|1}}. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from {{convert|−20.6|°C|0}} on January 11, 1955, to {{convert|41.8|°C|0}} on June 21, 1998. A highest record of {{convert|42.9|°C|0}} was registered in another station on June 17, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cdc.cma.gov.cn/dataSetLogger.do?changeFlag%3DdataLogger |title=无标题文档 |access-date=2013-02-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318113757/http://cdc.cma.gov.cn/dataSetLogger.do?changeFlag=dataLogger |archive-date=2013-03-18}}</ref><ref name = Mherrera/> An unofficial record low of {{convert|-25.0|°C|0}} was also recorded in January 1930, but at another weather station in the northern suburbs of the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=中国各地城市的历史最低气温 |url=https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309404203050792315805 |access-date=2024-09-17 |website=weibo.com}}</ref>

===National Time Service Center===
The [[National Time Service Center|Shaanxi Astronomical Observatory]] was established in 1966. In 1975, according to the Geodetic Origin Report of the People's Republic of China, 'in order to avoid bias in the mensuration as much as possible, the Geodetic Origin would be in central mainland China.' Lintong ({{lang|zh-hans|临潼}}), a town near Xi'an was chosen. Since 1986, Chinese Standard Time (CST) was set from NTSC. The National Time Service Center (NTSC), the Chinese Academy of Sciences is an institute which is mainly engaged in the service and research on time and frequency. NTSC takes charge of generating and maintaining the national standard time scale, disseminating the time and frequency signals. The autonomous standard time scales of universal time and atomic time and the dissemination techniques with LF radio and HF radio were established successively during the 1970s and 1980s, which meet all the requirements for different applications on the whole, such as the scientific researches, national economy, etc.<ref>[http://www.time.ac.cn/jianjie/1.htm NTSC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001755/http://www.time.ac.cn/jianjie/1.htm |date=March 4, 2016 }} 国家授时中心简介</ref>
