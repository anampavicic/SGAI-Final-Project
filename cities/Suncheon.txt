It is located in the southeast of the province and is a scenic [[Agriculture|agricultural]] and [[industrial city]], known for tourist attractions, such as [[Suncheon Bay]]. The port city of [[Yeosu]] is around forty minutes south of Suncheon and [[Gwangyang]] twenty minutes to the east of the city.

It is currently experiencing strong development due to being included as part of the ''Gwangyang Bay Free Economic Zone'', one of three newly created [[Free Economic Zone]]s (FEZs) in South Korea due to open within the next decade. As of October 14, 2007 plans are being set up and a referendum is being planned for a merging of the cities of [[Yeosu]], Suncheon and [[Gwangyang]] into a new metropolitan city, taking advantage of the Gwangyang Bay Free Economic Zone, Yeosu's [[Expo 2012]] bid and port facilities, Suncheon's educational institutes and Gwangyang's [[POSCO]] plant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200709/200709070009.html |title=Yeosu, Surrounding Cities to Merge|access-date=2007-10-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024012001/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200709/200709070009.html |archive-date=2007-10-24 }}</ref>
