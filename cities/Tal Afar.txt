==History==
=== Prehistory ===
{{convert|10|km|mi}} southwest of the town of Tal Afar are the mounds of [[Yarim Tepe]] which yielded remains from the [[Halafian culture]] of the [[Hassuna]], [[Tell Halaf|Halaf]] and [[Ubaid period|Ubaid]] periods, between 7000 and 4500 BC.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Prehistory'', by [[Peter N. Peregrine]], [[Melvin Ember]], Inc., Human Relations Area Files, Pg 149.</ref><ref>''Dictionary of the Ancient Near East'', by Piotr Bienkowski, A. R. Millard, Yarim Tepe, 2000, Pg 326</ref>

=== Assyrian Empire ===
From perhaps the 25th century BC through to the 7th century AD it was an integral part of [[Assyria]].

=== Ottoman Empire ===
The English traveller, archaeologist, and future diplomat [[Austen Henry Layard]]—one day to become the [[United Kingdom]]'s Ambassador to the [[Ottoman Empire]]—wrote in his book 1867 book ''Nineveh and Its Remains'':

{{cquote|Tel Afer was once a town of some importance; it is mentioned by the early Arab geographers, and may perhaps be identified with the Telassar of Isaiah, referred to, as it is, in connection with [[Tell Halaf|Gozan]] and [[Haran]]. It has been three times besieged, within a few years, by [[Ali Pasha of Baghdad]], [[Hafız Ahmed Pasha|Hafiz Pasha]], and [[Injeh Bairakdar Mohammed Pasha]]. On each occasion the inhabitants offered a vigorous resistance. Mohammed Pasha took the place by assault. More than two-thirds of the inhabitants were put to the sword, and the property of the remainder was confiscated. Great wealth is said to have been discovered in the place, on its pillage by Mohammed Pasha, who took all the gold and silver, and distributed the remainder of the spoil amongst his soldiers.<ref>''Nineveh and Its Remains'', by Austen Henry Layard, 1867, pgs 217–218.</ref>}}

Nelida Fuccaro wrote "After Hafiz Pasha's expedition in 1837 Tall 'Afar was occupied permanently by Ottoman troops and started to be used as a base to control the movements of a number of the [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] tribes of eastern Sinjar. In the 1880s Tall 'Afar became an administrative unit depending on the [[Sinjar]] ''[[Kaza|qadha]]''."<ref>''The Other Kurds: Yazidis in Colonial Iraq'', by Nelida Fuccaro, 1999, p. 33.</ref>

Sometime during the Ottoman Empire, the [[Ottoman Army (1861–1922)|Ottoman Army]] founded the city as a sole military outpost constructed on top of a hill.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Remains of the fortress can still be seen today. Also garrisoned at the fortress were Turkmen members of the Daloodi tribe who following the withdrawal of the Ottoman Army became the first civilian occupants of the town built around the fortress. [[Aylmer Haldane]], the [[British Army|British]] General Officer Commanding Mesopotamia, described Tel Afar as "That town of ten thousand inhabitants is picturesquely situated on four knolls, which stand two on each side of a deep gully, whence rises a stream which supplies the inhabitants with water."<ref name="Haldane">{{cite book |last1=Haldane |first1=James Aylmer Lowthorpe |title=The Insurrection in Mesopotamia, 1920 |date=1922 |publisher=W.

=== 1920 Iraqi Revolt ===
{{Main|Iraqi revolt of 1920}}
After the fall of the Ottoman Empire, Tal Afar was included in Iraq. In 1920, Tal Afar was used as a base of operations for a [[Iraqi revolt against the British|planned revolt]] against the [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia|then ruling British]].<ref>''A History of Iraq'', by Charles Tripp, Pg. 40</ref>

=== US Invasion and Occupation (2003-11) ===
=== Operation Black Typhoon ===
On September 9, 2004, a major military operation was launched against Tal Afar by the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division (Stryker Brigade Combat Team) and Iraqi Security forces. Fighting continued until September 12, 2004, when the government of [[Turkey]] claimed that the fighting had taken the lives of approximately 58 ethnic Turkmen civilians and demanded an end to military operations at which time the civilians camped outside Tal Afar were allowed to return to their homes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/oif-black-typhoon.htm|title=Operation Black Typhoon |publisher=[[GlobalSecurity.org]]}}</ref>

[[File:U.S. Army M1A2 Abrams at Tal Afar.jpg|thumb|U.S. [[M1 Abrams]] battle tanks patrolling Tal Afar on February 3, 2006]]

In September 2005, [[Operation Restoring Rights]] was conducted in which approximately 5,000 soldiers from the 3rd Division of the [[Iraqi Security Force]] in conjunction with 3,500 troops ([[Bob Woodward]] sites the number 5,300 troops in his book "The War Within") from the U.S. Army's [[3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment]] and the [[325th Airborne Infantry Regiment]], [[82nd Airborne Division]] entered the city. The operation resulted in 157 insurgents being killed and 683 captured.

The operation tested a new strategy of "clear, hold, build", in which areas would be purged of insurgents and then occupied and then rebuilt to win support from local people before being handed over to the Iraqi security forces.<ref name="Telegraph-2007-12-19">{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/1505872/Iraqis-in-former-rebel-stronghold-now-cheer-American-soldiers.html |title=Iraqis in former rebel stronghold now cheer American soldiers |first=Oliver |last=Poole |date=2005-12-19 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=2012-05-09}}</ref>

In March 2006, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W.

Colonel [[H.R. McMaster]], commander of the operation became an advisor to General [[David Petraeus]] in the planning and execution of the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|2007 troop surge]]. However, after years of intermittent violence, some commentators have said that the optimism expressed in 2005 was overstated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/jan-june07/carnage_03-28.html|title=Police and Militants Gun Down Sunnis in Revenge Attacks|website=[[PBS]] }}</ref>

=== Post-invasion violence ===
{{See also|January 2005 Tal Afar shootings|2007 Tal Afar bombings and massacre|Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL}}

Tal Afar has also been the scene of [[Sectarian violence in Iraq|sectarian violence]] between Shiite and [[Sunni Muslim]]s.

Before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] sectarian violence between Turkmens had not been a problem. Their shared cultural background had united Sunni and Shia Turkmens. Political mobilisation in Tal Afar had until then been dominated by the Baath party. With no readily available movement to replace Saddam's Baathists, the collapse of the state disrupting everything from food to security and increasing distrust towards the Shia dominated Iraqi government, tensions started to arise. Grievances were stoked further when Sunni Islamists began to move into the town and [[Badr Organization|Shia Iraqi]] security forces began purging Sunni's from the police force.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fitzsimmons|first1=Michael|title=GOVERNANCE, IDENTITY, AND COUNTERINSURGENCY: EVIDENCE FROM RAMADI AND TAL AFAR|date=March 2013|publisher=STRATEGIC STUDIES INSTITUTE and U.S. ARMY WAR COLLEGE PRESS|isbn=978-1-58487-567-3|url=http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub1150.pdf|access-date=22 May 2015}}</ref>

In May 2005, clashes broke out between the two groups. In October 2006, a bombing in Tal Afar killed 14 people, of whom ten were civilians and four Iraqi soldiers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} An additional bombing, outside a car dealership, on November 24, 2006, killed at least 22 and wounded at least 26.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

On February 10, 2007, a suicide car bomber killed one Iraqi soldier and wounded five people, including three civilians, as it targeted an army checkpoint.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSANW037148|title=FACTBOX-Security developments in Iraq, Feb 10|date=10 February 2007 |publisher=[[Reuters]]}}</ref> On February 22, 2007, four people were killed, including a policeman and a 12-year-old boy, and five were wounded, including two policemen, when two booby-trapped houses detonated while police were searching homes.

It was first reported to have killed 83 people and wounded 183, but the Iraqi Interior Ministry later raised the death toll to 152 and said that 347 were wounded, which would make it the deadliest single strike since the war started. The explosion, for which a terrorist group linked to [[Islamic State of Iraq|ISI]] claimed responsibility, led to reprisal shootings by Shiite policemen and others against Sunnis, in which between 47 and 70 men were killed. Several Shiite policemen were arrested for taking part in the shootings.<ref name="guardian-2007-04-01">[https://www.theguardian.com/worldlatest/story/0,,-6523781,00.html Iraq Raises Death Toll in Tal Afar Bomb], ''Guardian'', April 1, 2007</ref><ref name="reuters-2007-04-01">[https://archive.today/20130201071330/http://uk.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKPAR34073020070401 Deadliest bomb in Iraq war kills 152], Reuters, April 1, 2007</ref><ref name="nytimes-2007-04-01">[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/01/world/middleeast/01iraq.html Iraq Says Truck Bomb in North Killed 152], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 1, 2007</ref><ref name="cnn-2007-03-29">[http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/03/28/iraq.main/index.html Police accused in sectarian revenge killings], CNN, March 29, 2007</ref> On April 14, 2007, a sniper shot dead a woman.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKHA430762|title=FACTBOX-Security developments in Iraq, April 14|date=14 April 2007 |publisher=[[Reuters]]}}</ref> On May 21, 2007, a roadside bomb exploded near a police patrol, wounding three policemen on the main road between the town of Sinjar and Tal Afar.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-developments-idUSKHA91628520070521|title=FACTBOX: Security developments in Iraq, May 21|date=21 May 2007 |publisher=[[Reuters]]}}</ref> On May 31, 2007, a roadside bomb targeting a police patrol wounded four policemen on the road between Sinjar and Tal Afar.

On 14 May 2010, an attacker detonated explosives hidden inside a vehicle at the entrance to the football stadium, killing ten people and injuring 120 others. Earlier, the [[Islamic State of Iraq]] warned Shiites of "dark days soaked with blood".  "What is happening to you nowadays is just a drizzle," said [[Abu Suleiman al-Naser]], the group's "minister of war".<ref name="Deadly bombing hits Iraqi stadium">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8683642.stm | work=BBC News | title=Deadly bombing hits Iraqi stadium | date=May 14, 2010 | access-date=May 24, 2010}}</ref> On March 7, 2012, at least 12 people were killed in a coordinated car- and suicide bombing attack.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

=== ISIS aftermath ===
Many of the Turkmen of Tal Afar have been displaced and moved to areas further south in Iraq ever since ISIL captured the area. Many have also joined Iraqi forces fighting ISIL.<ref>[http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/01/turkey-syria-iraq-shiite-turkmens-angry-with-ankara.html# Turkey Pulse article on situation of the Turkmen] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327115233/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/01/turkey-syria-iraq-shiite-turkmens-angry-with-ankara.html|date=2016-03-27}}</ref> {{needs update|date=October 2023}}

==Geography==
[[File:Ninevehdistricts.jpg|thumb|200px|Districts of Nineveh]]

Tal Afar is located approximately 50&nbsp;km west of [[Mosul]] and 60&nbsp;km east of the Iraqi–Syrian border, at coordinate 36°23′N 42°27′E. According to map data, it has a total area of 15&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.

Tal Afar is located in the gap between the anticlines of [[Jabal Zambar]] to the southeast and [[Jebel Sasan]] to the northwest.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sitzungsberichte. Abt. 1, Biologie, Mineralogie, Erdkunde und verwandte Wissenschaften|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RywwAQAAIAAJ|year=1953|page=392}}</ref> The city is located in an open [[desert]] plain at the southern base of the Aedea Mountains. Much of the terrain surrounding the city is flat desert. A major east–west highway, which spans [[Nineveh Governorate]] and intersects Iraq's main central north–south highway near [[Mosul]], runs through the city.

The city of Tal Afar is organized into eighteen neighborhoods or districts: Sa'ad, Qadisiyah, Todd A-O, Sara, Mohalemeen, Madlomin, Uruba, Wahada, Nida, A'a lot, Hassan Qoi, Mothana, Khadra, Jazeera, Taliha, Kifah, Malain and Qalah ({{langx|tr|Kale}}).

Each neighborhood maintains its identity due to the tribal nature of the city. Several dozen extended families living in close proximity will typically identify with one local sheikh who takes it upon himself to serve as steward of the neighborhood's citizens and liaison to the local government. The layout of the town consists of densely packed buildings, often constructed so closely to each other that they share common load-bearing walls and supports. The city's streets further physically define each neighborhood by separating it from other groups of buildings, since they cut through the town in irregular patterns.

The [[United States Army]] and local government implemented a home address system to better identify specific locations and define jurisdiction for the [[Iraqi Police]] in the second half of the 2000s.

== Economy==
In January 2007, the largest single employer in the city was the [[Iraqi Ministry of the Interior]], which had hired roughly 2,250 [[Iraqi Police|policemen]]. The second-largest employer was the United States government. The [[101st Airborne Division (United States)|101st Airborne]] 3rd Brigade was stationed at Tal Afar Airbase in 2003–04 and its 1st Battalion was stationed in the town proper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/tall-afar-ab.htm|title=Tall ?Afar Airbase |publisher=[[GlobalSecurity.org]]}}</ref>

==Landmarks==
The [[Tal Afar Citadel]], a ruined Ottoman fortress, is located in the center of the city.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schlosser|first1=Nicholas J.|title=The Pacification of Tal Afar|url=http://history.army.mil/news/2015/150800a_talAfar.html|website=U.S. Army Center of Military History|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905085047/http://history.army.mil/news/2015/150800a_talAfar.html|archive-date=5 September 2015|date=August 2015}}</ref> Local history states that British administrators augmented the structure of the original fortress. During the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the fortress was further augmented and made to house the city's mayoral, municipal and police headquarters. The neighborhood including and surrounding the fortress is known as ''Qalah'' or "Castle".

Large parts of the citadel were blown up by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] in December 2014.<ref>{{cite news|title=Extremist IS militants damage ancient citadel, two shrines in Iraq's Nineveh|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2014-12/31/c_133890461.htm|work=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|date=31 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113075719/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2014-12/31/c_133890461.htm|archive-date=13 January 2015}}</ref>

==Politics and government==
Tal Afar's local government consists of a city council, local [[sheikhs]] and a mayor. The mayor is appointed by the council of sheikhs and confirmed by the provincial regional administrator. The mayor need not be originally from the city nor Iraqi Turkmen. The mayor from 2005 to 2008 was Najim Abdullah Abed al-Jabouri,<ref>{{cite news |title=For every Iraqi party, an army of its own |author=Najim Abed al-Jabouri |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/29/opinion/29abed.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=28 October 2009 |access-date=3 August 2016}}</ref> a Sunni Arab originally from [[Qayyarah]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rudaw.net/arabic/middleeast/iraq/140420151|title=بالصور...من سيقود عمليات الموصل ؟|work=Rudaw|access-date=2017-08-12}}</ref>

The Iraqi Turkmen demographic of Tal Afar and its geographic location have made it an important city in the argument for Iraqi federalism. Following a program of "[[Arabization]]" initiated by [[Saddam Hussein]] in the 1970s, large numbers of Sunni Arabs supportive of the [[Baathist]] government were moved into areas around Tal Afar. Geographically, the region the city is located in is a border area separating Kurdish lands to the north and Arab lands to the south in the [[Al Anbar]] governorate.
