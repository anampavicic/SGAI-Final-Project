'''Luján de Cuyo''' is the district capital of the [[Luján de Cuyo Department]] located in the west of the [[Mendoza Province]] of [[Argentina]]. It forms part of the Greater Mendoza metropolitan area.

==Wine==

It was the first delineated [[appellation]] for the purposes of wine production, recognised by the [[International Organisation of Vine and Wine]] in 1993.

Situated in the upper Mendoza valley, where the river is half-way through its journey from the Andes mountains to the eastern plains, many Lujan de Cuyo vineyards sit at altitudes of around 1000&nbsp;m (3280&nbsp;ft). Malbec in particular is successful in Lujan de Cuyo, but the appellation also produces good Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay and Torrontes. The majority of the vineyards are on alluvial soils; sandy or stony surfaces on clay substrata.

==Sport==

[[Asociación Atlético Luján de Cuyo]] are a football club that currently play in the regionalised [[Torneo Argentino A|Argentine 3rd division]]

==Notable people==
