There are several faculties of the [[La Laguna University]] in Santa Cruz, including the Fine Arts School and the Naval Sciences Faculty. Its harbour is one of Spain's busiest. It is important for commercial and passenger traffic as well as for being a major stopover for cruisers en route from Europe to the Caribbean. The city also has one of the world's largest [[carnival]]s. The [[Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] now aspires to become a [[World Heritage Site]], and is the second largest in the world.<ref name="santacruzmas.com">[http://www.santacruzmas.com/SantaCruzMas09.asp?IdMenu=10&IdSeccion=41&IdSubseccion=238]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref>

The varied architecture of the city stands out, highlighting the [[Auditorio de Tenerife]] (''Auditorium of Tenerife''), which is considered one of the greatest exponents of [[contemporary architecture]]. In the panoramic view of the city, the [[Torres de Santa Cruz]] (''Santa Cruz Towers'') also stand out, with the tallest twin towers in Spain at {{Convert|120|m|sp=us}} high. Other outstanding places are the [[Plaza de España (Santa Cruz de Tenerife)|Plaza de España]] (''Spain Square''), which is the nerve center of the city, and the [[Parque García Sanabria]] (''García Sanabria Park''), a large urban park located in the center of the city. Outside the city but in its municipal district, [[Playa de Las Teresitas]] (''Las Teresitas'') and a large part of the [[Macizo de Anaga]] (''Anaga Massif'') stand out, declared a [[Biosphere Reserve]] by UNESCO in 2015. Santa Cruz de Tenerife hosts the first headquarters of the Center [[UNESCO]] in the Canary Islands. In recent years the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife has seen the construction of a significant number of modern structures and the city's [[skyline]] is the sixth in height across the country, behind [[Madrid]], [[Benidorm]], [[Barcelona]], [[Valencia]] and [[Bilbao]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?countryID=13 |title=Spain Skyscraper Diagram |publisher=Skyscraperpage.com |access-date=2011-04-13}}</ref>

In 2012, the British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' included Santa Cruz de Tenerife in the list of the five best places in the world to live, next to the [[Cihangir]] district, in [[Istanbul]]; the district of [[Sankt Pauli]], in [[Hamburg]], the north coast of [[Maui]], in [[Hawaii]] and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], in [[Oregon]].<ref name="abc.es">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/20120127/sociedad/abci-mejores-sitios-vivir-mundo-201201271128.html#.UytJQvd1cNw.facebook|title=Santa Cruz de Tenerife, uno de los cinco mejores sitios del mundo para vivir, según "The Guardian"|work=ABC|date=27 January 2012 |location=Madrid|access-date=25 May 2015}}</ref> The 82% of the municipal territory of Santa Cruz de Tenerife is considered a natural area, this is due in large part to the presence of the [[Macizo de Anaga|Anaga Rural Park]].

==Etymology==
The area where Santa Cruz currently lies belonged to Menceyato Guanche [[Anaga]], which was the most easterly of the island. The city that is now Santa Cruz had a few names throughout its history: '''Añazo''' or '''Añaza''' ([[Guanche language|Guanche]] name), '''Puerto de Santiago Santa Cruz de Tenerife''', '''Santa Cruz de Santiago de Tenerife''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.santacruzmas.com/SantaCruzMas.asp?IdMenu=4&IdSeccion=39|title=El por qué de Santa Cruz de Santiago de Tenerife Santa Cruz de Tenerife – Portal turismo y ocio de Santa Cruz de Tenerife Islas Canarias – SANTACRUZ MAS +++++++++|access-date=25 May 2015}}</ref> and '''Santa Cruz de Tenerife''' (current), which means: "holy [[cross]] of Tenerife," in memory of the foundation of the city, when a [[Christian cross]] was planted in the place that is now the center of town.

===Guanche period, conquest and Castilian colonization===
The area on which now stands the city and the municipality of Santa Cruz de Tenerife has been the subject of human occupation since the time of the [[Guanches]], approximately 2000 years ago, as attested by the archaeological sites found. The area was known to the Guanches, the first inhabitants of the island, as ''Añazo'' or ''Añaza''. The famous [[Mummy of San Andrés]] is one of the most important archaeological remains of the aboriginal past of the region. Besides caves with some remains of mummified animals and stones with engravings ruprestres. This area belonged to the [[Menceyato de Anaga]] (aboriginal Guanche kingdom of Anaga), one of nine in which the island was divided.

On 3 May 1494 Castilian troops under the control of the conqueror [[Alonso Fernández de Lugo]] disembarked on the beaches of the present city and founded a military camp that would eventually develop into the city.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://mdc.ulpgc.es/cdm/singleitem/collection/MDC/id/44128/rec/1|title=La conquista de Tenerife : 1494–1496 :: Memoria Digital de Canarias – Textos|website=mdc.ulpgc.es|access-date=2018-01-24}}</ref> From this place began the conquest of the island of Tenerife. During the foundation, Alonso Fernández de Lugo placed a large wooden cross in reference to the day of disembarkation, during the [[Catholic]] festivity of the [[Invention of the Cross]] (3 May). After the conquest and defeat of the Guanche aborigines, the capital of the island was initially established in the city of [[San Cristóbal de La Laguna]], which was founded in the same year of the conquest of the island in 1496.<ref name="auto"/>

===Old Regime and Modern Stage===
Later, it became one of the most important ports of the Atlantic, a status it retains to this day. This former fishermen's village rose to prominence after a Volcano destroyed the port of [[Garachico]] in the 18th century. Santa Cruz became the major port on the Island. It first won its independence from La Laguna and, in the 19th century, was awarded the status of Capital of the [[Province of Canary Islands]] by King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]].

Between 1833 and 1927 Santa Cruz de Tenerife was the sole capital of the Canary Islands. In 1927 a Royal [[decree]] ordered that the status of capital city of the Canary Islands would be shared with Las Palmas in Gran Canaria. This arrangement remains in place today.<ref name="Real Decreto wikisource"/><ref name="Real Decreto Canarias"/>

In 1893 an outbreak of [[cholera]]-[[morbid]] spread throughout the city and neighboring municipalities. The disease was brought by an [[Italy|Italian]] ship returning from [[Brazil]]. There were 382 dead.<ref>[https://www.laopinion.es/opinion/2014/12/14/santa-cruz-benefica-colera-1893/580679.html Santa Cruz, Muy Benéfica. El cólera de 1893]</ref>

Between 1936 and 1939, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Canary Islands were in the rear of General [[Francisco Franco]]'s side. In this context, in 1936 the republican mayor of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, [[:es: José Carlos Schwartz|José Carlos Schwartz Hernández]], was arrested and murdered. After the war, years of great economic difficulties followed.

From 1978, with the new Spanish Constitution and the Statute of Autonomy of the Canary Islands, a new stage began, always with democratically elected mayors.

In the 80s and 90s of the 20th century, the city experiences a great economic boom. The expansion of the city towards the south begins gaining ground to the Santa Cruz de Tenerife Refinery and creating new residential and urbanizable areas such as [[:es: Cabo-Llanos|Cabo-Llanos]]. Since then, this area of the city is immersed in a major construction boom that has been nicknamed "[[Manhattanization]]",<ref>[http://coloquioscanariasamerica.casadecolon.com/index.php/CHCA/article/view/9998 La utópica "manhattanización" de Cabo-Llanos en Santa Cruz de Tenerife para el siglo XXI]</ref> due to the presence of tall buildings and the layout of the streets that mimics that of American cities.

===Current era: 21st century===
Santa Cruz inaugurated the 21st century with a great expansionary and commercial boom that is especially manifested in architecture with the construction of emblematic buildings such as the [[Auditorio de Tenerife]], the work of [[Santiago Calatrava]] or the remodeling of the [[Plaza de España (Santa Cruz de Tenerife)|Plaza de España]] according to the design of Swiss architects [[Herzog & de Meuron]].

A torrential flood took place on 31st March 2002. This was caused by a phenomenon of cold drop characterized by the repeated fall of torrential rain accompanied by lightning, which affected the metropolitan area of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The flooding caused 8 dead, 12 missing and dozens injured.<ref>[http://www.eldia.es/2002-04-09/actualidad/actualidad1.htm Ya son OCHO los muertos]. ''[[El Día (Canarias)|El Día]]''. 09/04/2011.</ref>

In recent years, it has become clear that there exists a ''de facto'' union with neighbouring city [[San Cristóbal de La Laguna]] (141,627 inhabitants as in 2005 census) due to the rapid population growth and reduction in undeveloped space between the cities, as their suburbs merged, forming a metropolitan area with 420,198 inhabitants (including the nearby municipalities of Tegueste, Candelaria and El Rosario). Regarding this situation, the mayor of Santa Cruz, [[Miguel Zerolo Aguilar]] and his La Laguna counterpart, Ana María Oramas Moro, both belonging to the [[Canarian Coalition]], stated several times to local media that they shared a willingness to proceed to a full political union between their municipalities, even though the decision was postponed to a date after the local elections in 2007. As of 2012 the merger is no longer part of the political agenda.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/lifestyle/travel/features/article_1524681.php/Tenerife-s-city-La-Laguna-inspires-with-Spanish-colonial-architecture |title=Tenerife's city la Laguna inspires with Spanish colonial architecture - Monsters and Critics |access-date=2016-02-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830124229/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/lifestyle/travel/features/article_1524681.php/Tenerife-s-city-La-Laguna-inspires-with-Spanish-colonial-architecture |archive-date=30 August 2013 }}</ref>

The [[2007–2008 financial crisis]] paralyzed the development of the city for more than a decade.{{Citation needed|date=January 2024}}

In June 2018, the dismantling of the Santa Cruz de Tenerife Refinery was announced, which will allow the expansion of the city to the south.<ref>[https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2018/06/la-refineria-se-va-y-deja-un-nuevo-dibujo-de-santa-cruz/ La Refinería se va y deja un nuevo dibujo de Santa Cruz]</ref>

==Administrative divisions==

In 1990, the population peaked above the 200,000 mark.

Ethnically, the population is mainly of European origin, primarily from the Iberian Península, both Spain and Portugal, with some mix of the island's original inhabitants, the [[Guanches]]. There has been some Latin American immigration (especially from Cuba and Venezuela) as well as from both Northern and Sub-Sahara Africa. There are also important historical minorities such as Indians ([[Sindhi people|Sindhi]]), Koreans (see [[Koreans in Spain]]) and, more recently, [[Russians]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The majority of the population professes the [[Catholic]] religion, but there are also small communities of [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s. In Santa Cruz de Tenerife, crime has decreased in recent years and the city has gained a reputation for tolerance among its inhabitants. In fact, Santa Cruz de Tenerife was the first city of the Canary Islands to display the [[rainbow flag]] alongside the flag of the City Council, in June 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/noticias-email/626465/Santa-Cruz-celebra-que-los-LGTB-pueden-amar-sin-ser-condenados-a-pena-de-muerte |title=Santa Cruz celebra que los LGTB "pueden amar sin ser condenados a pena de muerte" |publisher=Ecodiario.eleconomista.es |date=28 June 2008 |access-date=2011-04-13}}</ref>

In comparison with the nearby city of [[San Cristóbal de La Laguna]], which is the seat of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Cristóbal de La Laguna|Bishopric of Tenerife]], traditionally the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife has had a much more secular character. This fact brought about in the city institutions of deep secular tradition such as the [[Masonic Temple of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] that was one of the largest masonic centers in Spain.<ref>[http://www.eldia.es/2002-10-17/SANTACRUZ/0-templo-masonico-bien-interes-cultural.htm#4 El templo masónico, bien de interés cultural]</ref>

According to a study by the National Statistics Institute of Spain (INE), among the two Canarian capitals, Santa Cruz de Tenerife is the one with the highest life expectancy at 81 years. Just behind Santa Cruz is [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]], with 80.9 years.<ref name="diariodeavisos.elespanol.com"/>

==Infrastructure==
[[File:Santa Cruz Autopista TF-5.jpg|thumb|[[Autopista TF-5]] passing by the Guajara Commercial Area and the Central Campus]]
As the centre of the Tenerife Metropolitan Area, Santa Cruz is the hub for the island's motorway network. The {{Convert|85|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} long [[Autopista TF-1]] links the south of the island, including [[Playa de las Américas]] and other southern resorts and towns, with its capital. The motorway itself starts near the Auditorio and gives access to Santa Cruz and La Laguna by three different routes.

[[Autopista TF-5]] links Santa Cruz with the [[Puerto de la Cruz]], [[La Orotava]] and the northern side of the island, passing right through La Laguna before entering Santa Cruz.

The [[Santa Cruz harbour]] is one of the busiest in Spain; three quays host regular ferries, fast ferries, cruise ships and merchant ships.

[[Tenerife North Airport]], formerly Los Rodeos Airport, is adjacent to [[Autopista TF-5]] on the western outskirts of the city.

The mostly tourist [[Tenerife South Airport]], formerly Reina Sofia Airport, ranks 7th in Spain and is located next to the Autopista TF-1, {{Convert|75|km|abbr=on}} south of Santa Cruz. There are plans to link this airport to the capital with a railway network.

The [[Intercambiador]] public transport/mass transit terminal is in the Avenida 3 de Mayo, and is the hub for all [[TITSA]] bus lines, the [[Tenerife Tram]] service, and is a major car-parking area.

The first tram line (opened in 2007) line 1, starts at the [[Intercambiador]], and ends at [[San Cristóbal de La Laguna|La Laguna]]'s Avenida Trinidad, with a planned extension to [[Tenerife North Airport]] A second line between La Cuesta and Tíncer opened in 2009 (connecting with Line 1 at Hospital Universitario and El Cardonal).

Cabo-Llanos (south of downtown) is the location of new expansion. This area is undergoing a major building boom which has been nicknamed "[[Manhattanization]]", where tall, modern buildings and street layouts imitate American cities.

==Economy==
Santa Cruz de Tenerife has the highest concentration of shops in the Canary Islands.<ref>[https://www.canarias7.es/canarias/tenerife/apostamos-santa-cruz-20220518162753-nt.html?ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canarias7.es%2Fcanarias%2Ftenerife%2Fapostamos-santa-cruz-20220518162753-nt.html «Apostamos por una Santa Cruz activa, viva y dinámica»]</ref> The economy of Santa Cruz relies mainly on services. Trade, tourism, import-export, the seaport and the presence of the major political and financial institutions, as well as the most important companies, guarantee a strong economic activity and development. The building sector is important, while industry, apart from the [[Refinería de Santa Cruz de Tenerife|oil refinery]] and food processing, is relatively minor. Santa Cruz has regenerated many areas of the city and modernised its infrastructure, built brand new areas, malls, high buildings and some charismatic structures, such as [[Santiago Calatrava|Calatrava]]'s ''Auditorio'' or the Congress Hall, [[César Manrique]]'s Marina and the not-yet-completed [[Óscar Domínguez]] Museum of Modern Art and Culture ([[IODACC]]) and the new Plaza de España layout, both by [[Basel]]-based [[Pritzker Prize]] winner studio [[Herzog & de Meuron]]. Work to renew the man-made Las Teresitas Beach is ongoing under the direction of French architect [[Dominique Perrault]].

[[File:Reina carnaval.jpg|right|thumb|Queen of the [[Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]]. This carnival is one of the largest in the world.]]

Santa Cruz has not been characterized by an intense night life, in contrast to the nearby university town of [[San Cristóbal de La Laguna|La Laguna]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Nevertheless, there are several clubs and pubs spread across the city. There are also pubs that have survived without belonging to a particular location for leisure.

It has recently gained importance as a leisure street Antonio Dominguez Alfonso (popularly known as Calle La Noria) and adjacent in the vicinity of the [[Iglesia de la Concepción (Santa Cruz de Tenerife)|Church of the Conception]]. After several years of neglect, all the houses in this area has been recovered by the local hotel as tapas, light dinner and drinks. This street also hosts the headquarters of several [[Murga in Canary|murgas]], music groups linked to [[Carnival]], and independent organ of Events and Recreation.

Avenida de Anaga, also known as Avenida Francisco la Roche in its initial section, is a popular spot for enjoying dinner and drinks, especially along the avenues bordering the port. Back in the 1990s, it thrived as the city's nightlife center. However, many establishments closed due to licensing and noise restrictions.

Currently, efforts are underway to restore Avenida de Anaga's former glory. Since 2009, the city has implemented various initiatives to revitalize the area.

In 2007, an ambitious city revitalization plan named "Santa Cruz + Viva" was launched by the City Council in collaboration with the Society for Development, [[Cabildo Insular de Tenerife]], and the [[Government of the Canary Islands]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=El Corazón de Tenerife |url=https://www.elcorazondetenerife.com/ |access-date=2024-05-09 |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Naval history==
Due to the strategic location of Tenerife on the route between the Mediterranean and the Americas, it was attacked a number of times by the English and the Dutch. In particular, Santa Cruz Bay was the scene of two notable naval engagements involving two of the most famous British [[admiral]]s.

In 1656, Admiral [[Robert Blake (admiral)|Robert Blake]] totally [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1657)|destroyed a Spanish silver fleet]] of 16 ships for the loss of none of his own, despite being under fire from shore batteries and attacking and withdrawing on the tide. 50 years later, the British under [[John Jennings (Royal Navy officer)|John Jennings]] were defeated when they [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1706)|attacked the island]] on 6 November 1706 during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

In 1797 [[Admiral]] [[Horatio Nelson]] met with bloody defeat in an [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797)|attempt]] to storm the harbour. It was at this battle that Nelson lost his right arm having been hit before he had stepped off the ship's boat. It was on Santiago's day and that is the reason for having Santiago's sword cutting the lion's head as a symbol of the British defeat.

Behind the cross is a sword of Santiago in red, reminiscent of the day in which the city of Santiago defeated [[Horatio Nelson]]. Under this sword are three lion heads facing right (the shield), which symbolizes the victories over the attacks by Blake, Jennings and Nelson (the Spanish considered the 1657 attack a victory). It has castles, anchors and an island of silver. Also holds the Medal of Charity and the Crown.

===Carnival===
During the [[Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]], thousands of people take to the streets each year for over a week. On 18 January 1980 it was declared a [[Fiestas of International Tourist Interest of Spain|Fiesta of International Tourist Interest]] by the Secretary of State for Tourism, and is one of the world's largest carnivals.<ref>[http://www.canarias7.es/articulo.cfm?Id=46222 Noticia sobre el Carnaval en Canarias] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105180544/http://www.canarias7.es/articulo.cfm?Id=46222 |date=5 January 2016 }}, publicada por el diario [[Canarias7]], 7 February 2007</ref><ref><<Yoteca>> Guía de ayuda documentada,[http://www.yoteca.com/url/Informacion-de-carnavales.asp] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105180544/http://www.yoteca.com/url/Informacion-de-carnavales.asp|date=5 January 2016}}, 22 February 2008</ref> At present, the Carnival of Santa Cruz hopes to become a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name="santacruzmas.com"/>

===Masonic influence===
[[File:Templo Masónico 14.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Eye of Providence]], on the facade of the [[Masonic Temple of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]].]]
Santa Cruz de Tenerife is characterized, among other things, by the influence of [[Freemasonry]]<ref>[http://www.academia.edu/18989443/Los_conventos_de_La_Orotava Los conventos de La Orotava. Manuel Hernández González.]</ref><ref>[https://mdc.ulpgc.es/utils/getfile/collection/MDC/id/184213/filename/265583.pdf La Masonería en Canarias]</ref> exhibited by some of the most important historical buildings in the city, a palpable influence even on the plane of the city.

The city had a significant number of mayors and politicians affiliated with Freemasonry, especially between the 19th and early 20th centuries. In this city the Añaza Lodge (''Logia Añaza'') was founded in 1895, which was one of the most important Masonic workshops in Spain in the 20th century and helped consolidate Freemasonry in the Canary Islands and spread the culture and ideas of progress in the Canarian society of the time.<ref>[https://www.eldiario.es/canariasahora/tenerifeahora/santa_cruz/rehabilitacion-templo-masonico-santa-cruz-tenerife-arrancara-primer-trimestre-2022_1_8452152.html La rehabilitación del Templo Masónico de Santa Cruz de Tenerife arrancará en el primer trimestre de 2022]</ref> Under its auspices the Masonic Temple of Santa Cruz de Tenerife will be built, located on Calle San Lucas and which was the largest Masonic center in Spain until the military occupation of the Franco regime.

The influence of Masonic symbolism on the architecture and urban planning of the city has been the subject of various academic studies, from the works of Professor Sebastián Hernández Gutiérrez of the [[University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]],<ref>[https://accedacris.ulpgc.es/bitstream/10553/2274/2/0234500_00000_0017.pdf Arquitectura y Masonería en las Islas Canarias]</ref> through the studies of Professor David Martín López from the [[University of Granada]].<ref>El arte masónico oficial de la Postguerra en Canarias. Marrero Regalado y Aguiar.</ref><ref>Sobre artistas masones y filomasones en tiempos de represión: José Aguiar, un pintor al Servicio de Franco. Martín López, David.</ref><ref>Arte y masonería: consideraciones metodológicas para su estudio (1936-1939). Madrid: Sociedad Estatal de Conmemoraciones Culturales, Ministerio de Cultura, 2007.</ref> More recently those of the architect Carlos Pallés, curator of the exhibitions "''Rostros de La Logia Añaza''" and "''Masonería y Sociedad''" held in 2014.

Melchor Padilla, professor of Geography and History at the [[University of La Laguna]], maintains that by joining some of the buildings and enclaves with Masonic symbols of the city, they form a pentacle or five-pointed star that would extend through the center of the city and whose center would be the García Sanabria Park. 

In 2016 an international Masonic congress was held in Santa Cruz de Tenerife in which 17 regular supreme councils from different countries of the world participated, around 300 people participated in the congress.<ref>[http://www.laopinion.es/tenerife/2015/04/12/masones-eligen-santa-cruz-congreso/600357.html Los masones eligen Santa Cruz para su congreso internacional del próximo año]</ref><ref>[http://eldia.es/santacruz/2016-11-06/3-Jesus-Soriano-emociona-venir-templo-Logia-Anaza.htm Jesús Soriano: "Me emociona venir al templo de la Logia Añaza"]</ref> At present there are several tourist routes with a Masonic theme that are organized in the city.<ref>[https://www.eldia.es/santa-cruz-de-tenerife/2021/05/07/proxima-ruta-guiada-patrimonio-centrara-51440477.html La próxima ruta guiada por el patrimonio se centrará en la ‘Santa Cruz misteriosa’]</ref><ref>[https://www.eldiario.es/canariasahora/cultura/ruta-masonica-tenerife_1_4715671.html ¿Una ruta masónica en Tenerife?]</ref>

==Commercial areas==
Santa Cruz is popular for its wide commercial offerings, including zona Centro (Central part) – Pedestrian calle Castillo, San José, del Pilar, Viera y Clavijo Zona Rambla (Rambla area) or Rambla de Pulido, calle Ramón y Cajal, and the big shopping centres and [[department stores]] in Avenida de 3 Mayo, plus the big malls in Añaza on the southern suburbs. The most upmarket and high street shopping is located along Calle del Pilar and nearby Parque Bulevar Shopping Centre, where many designer shops can be found. International and local brands of shops and restaurants are much present on the island. Not only the wide range of shops makes the city attractive but the [[lower prices]] found in many items, such as tobacco, alcohol, electronic devices, beauty products, sunglasses or even food or coffee. They are indeed much lower than in most cities of Western Europe including Spain, due to the very special and much lighter taxation on goods enjoyed on the Canary Islands.
