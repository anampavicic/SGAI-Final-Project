'''Mazyr''' or '''Mozyr''' ({{langx|be|Мазыр}}, {{IPA-be|maˈzɨr|IPA}}; {{langx|ru|Мозырь}}, {{IPA|ru|ˈmozɨrʲ|IPA}}; {{langx|pl|Mozyrz}}; {{langx|yi|מאזיר}}) is a city in [[Gomel Region]], [[Belarus]]. It serves as the administrative center of [[Mazyr District]].<ref name="pop"/> It is situated on the [[Pripyat (river)|Pripyat River]] about {{convert|210|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Pinsk]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} northwest of [[Chernobyl]] in Ukraine. As of 2024, it has a population of 105,152.<ref name="pop"/>

Mazyr is known as a center of oil refining, salt extraction, machine building, and food processing in Belarus.  It is home to one of the largest [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] in Belarus, pumping out 18 million metric tons per year, and is served by a tram line.  The [[Druzhba pipeline]] carries crude oil from Russia, splitting in two at Mazyr. One pipeline branch is directed into [[Poland]] and the other one to [[Ukraine]].

==History==
The city was mentioned in 1155.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tikhomirov |first1=Mikhail Nikolaevich |title=The Towns of Ancient Rus |date=1959 |publisher=Foreign Languages Publishing House |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bmdpAAAAMAAJ |language=en}}</ref>

It was a county seat in the [[Mińsk Voivodeship]] of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] until the [[Partitions of Poland]].<ref name=sgk>{{cite book|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Słownik geograficzny Królestwa Polskiego i innych krajów słowiańskich, Tom VI|year=1885|language=pl|location=Warszawa|page=754}}</ref> In the 18th century, [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] monasteries and churches of [[Cistercian]] monks and nuns were established.<ref name=kw>{{cite book|last=Węglicka|first=Katarzyna|title=Kresowym szlakiem.

During the [[Partitions of Poland]], the city was annexed by [[Russian Empire|Russia]], within which it was administratively part of the [[Minsk Governorate]]. The city was subjected to [[Russification]] policies. In the 19th century both Cistercian monasteries were closed down.<ref name=kw/> The women's convent was converted into an Orthodox monastery, while the men's monastery was planned to be demolished, but the plan was abandoned as it served as a shelter for Jews after a city fire.<ref name=kw/> Two annual [[fair]]s were held in the city in the late 19th century.<ref name=sgk/> During the [[Polish–Soviet War]], on March 4, 1920, the town was captured by the Poles,<ref>{{cite book|last=Ryłko|first=Władysław|year=1929|title=Zarys historji wojennej 7-go pułku artylerii polowej|language=pl|location=Warszawa|page=12}}</ref> but later on it fell to the Soviets.

During [[World War II]], the German occupiers operated a Nazi prison in the town.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=100000080|title=Gefängnis Mazyr|website=Bundesarchiv.de|access-date=10 December 2023|language=de}}</ref>

The city has suffered radioactive fallout from the [[Chernobyl disaster]].

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Cistercian churches were restored to the Catholics.<ref name=kw/>

==Jewish community== 
Jews were first mentioned in chronicles in the second half of the 17th century. It is known that there were three synagogues in the city as of 1856. R. Kugel, a prominent Jewish community figure, had been the chief Rabbi of Mazyr since 1861. He was also the head of the local Jewish literacy school.

During this period Jews were mostly engaged in craftsmanship and trading. Part of Mazyr's industry, the match factory and the wood sawing factory were owned by Jews.

There were eight active synagogues, a [[yeshiva]], Jewish school and Talmud-Torah school in the wake of the 20th century. All of the facilities had been closed down by 1939.

Thousands of Jews were [[The Holocaust in Belarus|executed by German troops]] in the local [[Jewish ghettos established by Nazi Germany|ghetto]] during World War II.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.yadvashem.org/untoldstories/database/index.asp?cid=500 | title=YV360 }}</ref> After the mass execution, almost no Jews remained in the city, whereas before the war 30% of the population within the city was Jewish. On August 31, 1941, hundreds of Jews gathered inside a house at Malo-Pushkin street. They poured kerosene on the building walls and set it alight, while the people huddled inside. The mass suicide was an attempt to escape execution by the Germans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/article/1b70a0c55887441907ef5979752b0ed5|title = Excavation Causes Controversy in Belarus|website = [[Associated Press]]}}</ref> The incident is known as the "[[Belarusian Masada]]".

After the war some Jews returned to Mazyr. Although they refused to take back the partially-destroyed synagogue building, an official Jewish community was registered in 1946. A few years later, authorities denied the organization's right to exist. The community organization was re-established officially in 1989, when a revival began in the city. A synagogue and a Jewish culture club were opened.

==Transport==
[[File:Railway station Mazyr, Belarus.jpg|thumb|Railway station]]
Mazyr has a tram service, which commenced operation on 1 August 1988. The line starts at the tram depot and terminates at the oil refinery, with four turning loops located along the route. It is designed to server Mazyr Oil Refinery (MNPZ) and is owned by the refinery. Services on the tram line are coordinated with shifts at the refinery; service throughout the day is every 25-95 minutes while during the peaks it is 3-12 minutes, though those services pass suburban stops without stopping. Most passengers are workers, though it also serves residents living near the line. The total length of the line is 20.3 km, with a full trip time of 40 minutes. The line has a high-speed layout, with radius of minimum 400 meters. There were plans for a second tram line, but this has not come to fruition.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mazyr|url=https://transphoto.org/city/172/|access-date=2021-05-31|website=transphoto.org|language=en}}</ref> The rolling stock is mainly [[71-605]] and its derivative vehicles.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mazyr, Tramway — Roster|url=https://transphoto.org/list.php?did=329|access-date=2021-05-31|website=transphoto.org|language=en}}</ref> VD Bolshoi Bokov airfield is located {{Convert|4|mi}} south of Mazyr and was used by Russian military aircraft during the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]].<ref name="AFMDEC22-28">{{cite book|title=[[AirForces Monthly]]|date=December 2022|publisher=[[Key Publishing|Key Publishing Ltd]]|location=[[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]], [[Lincolnshire]], [[England]]|pages=28}}</ref>
