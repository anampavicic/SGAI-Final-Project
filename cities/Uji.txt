{{nihongo|'''Uji'''|宇治市|Uji-shi}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] on [[Greater Kyoto|the southern outskirts of the city]] of [[Kyoto]], in [[Kyoto Prefecture]], [[Japan]].

Founded on March 1, 1951, Uji is between the two ancient capitals of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] and [[Kyoto, Kyoto|Kyoto]]. The city sits on the [[Uji River]], which has its source in [[Lake Biwa]].

{{As of|2020|10|01}} Uji has a population of 179,630 and is the second largest city in [[Kyoto Prefecture]]. It has an area of 67.54&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, giving it a [[population density]] of 2,660 persons per km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=uji-population-statistics/>

==History==
{{See also|List of Cultural Properties of Uji City (Kyōto Prefecture)}}

In the 4th century the son of [[Emperor Ōjin]] established a palace in Uji. The 11th-century author, [[Murasaki Shikibu]], set much of the final chapters of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' at Uji.<ref name="Green2008">{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Michelle|title=Kyoto Celebrates a 1,000-Year Love Affair|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/travel/04footsteps.html|work=New York Times|access-date=11 December 2017|date=31 December 2008}}</ref>

The [[Battle of Uji (1180)|first battle of Uji]] in 1180 was the first clash of the [[Genpei War]]. [[Taira clan|Taira]] forces caught up with [[Minamoto clan|Minamoto]] forces that were attempting to make their way to [[Nara, Japan|Nara]] and defeated them. Later in the war, two factions of Genji clashed at the [[Battle of Uji (1184)|second battle of Uji]] in 1184. In 1221, the [[Jōkyū War]] was decided at the [[Battle of Uji (1221)|third battle of Uji]], in which forces of the [[Kamakura shogunate]] defeated the retired [[emperor Go-Toba]], consolidating the shogunate's control over Japan and the [[Hōjō clan]]'s control over the shogunate. 

''[[Shōgun]]'' [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]] (1358–1408) promoted cultivation of [[Uji tea]] in the area. Since then Uji has been an important production and distribution center of superior quality green tea. Tsuen tea has been served since 1160 and is still sold in the oldest tea shop in Japan and possibly the world—the [[Tsuen Tea|Tsuen tea shop]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.glbrain.com/index.php?r=tool/view&id=10441&toolType=1 | title=Tsuen Tea House - the oldest teahouse in the world | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202234303/http://www.glbrain.com/index.php?r=tool/view&id=10441&toolType=1 | archive-date=2017-02-02}}</ref> In the 15th century, ''[[shimamono]]'' tea jars destined to be used in the [[Japanese tea ceremony]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sambali.blogspot.com/2006/09/luzon-jars-glossary.html|title=Quests of the Dragon and Bird Clan: Luzon Jars (Glossary)|date=5 September 2006}}</ref> were brought by the ''[[shōgun]]'' from [[Luzon]] to Uji.

Uji contains the ethnic Korean enclave [[Utoro district]], which was formed from forced laborers who were made to build an airstrip in Kyoto beginning in 1941.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=McNeill |first=David |last2=Hippin |first2=Andreas |date=July 6, 2005 |title=Kyoto Korea Town fights for survival |url=https://apjjf.org/-David-McNeill/1813/article.html |access-date=2023-09-19 |website=The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite news |last=McCurry |first=Justin |date=2022-07-18 |title=‘Utoro is my identity’: can a museum heal the scars of Korean migrants in Japan? |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/18/utoro-is-my-identity-can-a-museum-heal-the-scars-of-korean-migrants-in-japan |access-date=2023-09-19 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

==Sightseeing and events==

Most visitors are attracted to Uji for its centuries-old historic sites, which include many [[Shinto shrine]]s, [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[temple]]s and [[Shrine|Hindu Shrines]]. Among the most famous are the [[Ujigami Shrine]] (built in 1060) and the [[Byōdō-in]] that are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site "[[Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto]]". The [[Byōdō-in]], with its Amida (Phoenix) Hall built in 1053, is featured on the obverse side of the [[10 yen coin]]. It was also featured on several Japanese postage stamps, a. o. of 1950, 1957 and 1959.

Other religious sites include the [[Manpuku-ji]], the head temple of the [[Ōbaku]] [[Zen]] sect, built in [[China|Chinese]] [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] style in 1661 and the [[Zen]] temple Kōshō-ji, with its Kotozaka entrance (framed with dense thickets of [[sakura|cherry]], [[Kerria (plant)|kerria]], [[azalea]], and [[maple]] trees, each of which dramatically changes color with the seasons) constructed in 1648. Noteworthy is the Mimuroto-ji, which is famous for its purple hydrangeas. The city features numerous other small [[Shinto]] shrines. With a few exceptions, most of the important historical sites are in walking distance of one another and all are easily accessed by rail.

The last ten chapters of the Japanese classic [[novel]] ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' take place in Uji, and so there is [[The Tale of Genji Museum]].

Uji has many natural attractions, including its scenic riverside, large parks, and a botanical garden. Slightly upriver from Uji bridge, the [[Amagase Dam]] spans the river and day trippers can walk to its base in about an hour. The route, which begins directly across from Keihan Uji Station, is along the river on a paved road and offers access to several grassy open spaces where people can rest and picnic.

The city hosts two major festivals each year. The Agata Festival, held on June 5, begins in the early morning and runs until late at night. Like many cities in Japan, Uji hosts an hours-long fireworks festival on August 10. Both events draw huge crowds and require that the town's main thoroughfare to be shut down.

There is [[cormorant fishing]] in summer during the evening, from mid-June to late September.

==Transportation==

===Rail===
Uji is served by three rail companies: [[West Japan Railway Company|JR West]], [[Keihan Electric Railway|Keihan]], and [[Kintetsu Railway|Kintetsu]]. The Keihan line which runs primarily between [[Kyoto]] and downtown [[Osaka]] serves the city via the branch [[Keihan Uji Line|Uji Line]] running from Chushojima station and ending along the river at [[Uji Station (Keihan)|Keihan Uji Station]] beside the Uji Bridge. The station is close to Uji's [[Tale of Genji]] Town, Uji Bridge, and the Byodoin. All trains on this line stop at every station.

The [[Nara Line|JR Nara Line]] runs between [[Kyoto]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. [[Uji Station (JR West)|JR Uji station]] was, until a few years ago, fairly rural but was recently rebuilt to better serve the city. Architecturally it mimics the Byodo-in and is on the opposite side of the Uji river, about 10 minutes' walk from Keihan Uji Station. The clock in front of the station is of special interest and, every hour on the hour, opens to reveal an automated show that celebrates the town's heritage as a center of tea production. Like [[Uji Station (Keihan)|Keihan Uji Station]], JR Uji has easy access to the same sites. The station is served by local and express trains.

[[Kintetsu Railway|Kintetsu]] serves West Uji with a line between Kyoto and Nara and does not have a station named for the town. The line is primarily used by commuters and includes {{STN|Ogura}}, {{STN|Iseda}}, and {{STN|Ōkubo|Kyoto}}. No stations are close to the main tourist sites.

===Bus===
Local buses have routes in the city and [[public transportation]] is good. Charter buses to and from the [[Kansai]] International ([[Kansai International Airport|KIX]]) and [[Itami]] airports can be caught at most of the train stations.

===Roads===
[[File:Keijibypass.jpg|thumb|On ramp for Keiji Bypass]]
[[File:Uji-jinja, keidai.jpg|thumb|[[Uji Shrine]]]]Uji is south of the main [[Meishin Expressway]] and is served directly by the Keiji Bypass, a [[toll road]] that was completed a few years ago. The Keiji Bypass circumvents [[Kyoto]] and [[Ōtsu]] which can be subject to traffic jams. The road is notable for its high [[Trestle bridge|trestles]] and series of long [[tunnel]]s &mdash; including one that is approximately six miles long. The Keiji Bypass links to Dai Ni Keihan Road (Number Two Kyoto Osaka Road) which is under construction and usable for at least part of its length.

Non-[[toll road]]s include [[Japan National Route 1|Route 1]] which runs between [[Kyoto]] and [[Osaka]] and Route 24 which runs between [[Kyoto]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. These roads are usually filled with traffic and have many stoplights. Close by is Route 307, which runs east/west along the southern edge of the city between [[Osaka]] and [[Shiga]] prefecture.  This is a fairly rural road that leads through the mountains and, once away from the urban centers, makes a nice day trip.

Of special interest to [[motorsports]] enthusiasts is the Ujigawa Line (Uji River Line). This twisty road parallels the Uji River between Uji and Otsu and is a favorite for racers. The road is dangerous and often claims lives. Due to numerous accidents, the route is closed to [[motorcycle]]s for most of August, when Japanese schools are typically out of session.

==Friendship cities==
