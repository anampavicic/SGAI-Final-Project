'''Borujerd''' ({{langx|fa|بروجرد}}; {{IPA|fa|boɾuːˈdʒeɾd|}}){{efn|Also [[romanize]]d as '''Borūjerd'''}} is a city in the [[Central District (Borujerd County)|Central District]] of [[Borujerd County]], [[Lorestan province|Lorestan]] province in western [[Iran]], serving as capital of both the county and the district.

Among the existing modern cities in Iran, Borujerd is one of the oldest reported at least since the 9th century. In [[Sassanid Empire]], Borujerd was a small town and region neighboring [[Nahavand]]. Gaining more attention during [[Great Seljuq Empire]] in the 9th and 10th centuries, Borujerd stood as an industrial, commercial and strategic city in [[Zagros Mountains]] until the 20th century. In its golden ages, Borujerd was selected as the state capital of [[Lorestan Province|Lorestan]] and [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]] region during [[Qajar dynasty]] in the 18th and 19th centuries. Due to the existence of a large number of production and industrial units and the supply of their products in the domestic and foreign markets, Borujerd is considered the industrial hub of [[Lorestan province]].

==Foundation and name==
The history of Borujerd before the advent of [[Islam]] is not well known. [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]]-era artifacts have been discovered in its environs by non-professional excavators. Moreover, one of Iran's oldest mosques, the [[Jameh Mosque of Borujerd]], was constructed on the remains of a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[fire temple]]. This proves that the region was populated before Islam arrived. The Parthian king [[Orodes II]] ({{reign|57|37|era=BC}}) is credited by some academics with laying the city's foundation. They believe that "Borujerd" stems from the [[Middle Persian]] word ''Wurūgird/Wulūgird/Orodhkard'', meaning "built by Orodes." Others consider it to have been built by the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king [[Peroz I]] ({{reign|459|484}}), arguing that "Piruzgird" was its original name, before being changed into "Burugird", and then later Arabicised into "Burujird".{{sfn|Mobayyen|2021}} 

==History==
Only from the 9th-century does the name "Borujerd" appear in Islamic chronicles. It first appears in the ''Kitāb al-buldān'' of [[Ibn al-Faqih]] ({{fl|903}}), and is later reported in various forms, such as "Warukird", "Warugird", "Barugird" and "Barujird".{{sfn|Mobayyen|2021}}

Esteemed religious institutions operated in Borujerd during the [[Qajar Iran|Qajar]] era, producing two distinguished Shia scholars, Asad Allah Borujerdi (died {{circa|1854}}) and [[Hossein Borujerdi]] (died 1961).{{sfn|Mobayyen|2021}}

===Location===
Borujerd city is located approximately 1670 meters above sea level and has a moderate climate with cold winters. The highest point is [[Garrin Mountain]] 3623 m above sea level and the lowest area is [[Gelerood River]] in South with 1400 m elevation. Borujerd Township has 2600&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> area with approximately 400,000 inhabitants distributed in the city of [[Oshtorinan]] and more than 180 villages. Owing to favorable topographic and climatic conditions, the plains are devoted to cultivation of grain. Wherever irrigation is possible (by means of qanāts, wells, diversion of water of streams), cotton, melons, grapes, and fruit trees (especially almonds) are grown.<ref>[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/borujerd-town-and-sahrestan-in-lorestan Eckart Ehlers, “Borujerd”, Encyclopaedia Iranica. 1989]</ref>

Borujerd is located on [[Silakhor Plain]] which is the largest agricultural land of Lorestan.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}} The high-elevated [[Zagros Mountains]] surrounds it from South East to North West and the peaks are covered with snow most of the times. Rural people work in farms or keep their domestic animals. Other people work in governmental offices, armed forces, factories or small local businesses. The feet of Zagros Mountains is a great destination for nomads and many [[Lurs]] and [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiari]] nomads move there in summer. The area is paved with highways and is a crossroad between [[Tehran]] and [[Khuzestan Province]] as well as [[Isfahan Province]] and [[Kermanshah Province]].

===Climate===
Borujerd's climate is classified as [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]]([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa'') with dry and very hot summers and cold winters. Most of the precipitation falls in colder months from November to April. Snowfall can be observed in winter, which can sometimes become heavy and cause school closures in the county. Road access to villages can also be disturbed because of snow.<ref>{{cite web |title=Borujerd Snowfall |url=https://roozhayeborujerd.ir/tag/%d8%a8%d8%a7%d8%b1%d8%b4-%d8%a8%d8%b1%d9%81-%d8%a8%d8%b1%d9%88%d8%ac%d8%b1%d8%af/ |website=roozhayeborujerd |publisher=Borujerd Times |access-date=25 March 2024 |language=Persian}}</ref>
