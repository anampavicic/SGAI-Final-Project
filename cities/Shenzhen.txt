Shenzhen roughly follows the administrative boundaries of [[Bao'an County]], which was established in imperial times. After the [[Opium Wars]], the southern portion of Bao'an County was occupied by the British government and became part of [[British Hong Kong]], while the village of Shenzhen was next to the border. Shenzhen turned into a city in 1979. In the early 1980s, [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms]] introduced by [[Deng Xiaoping]] resulted in the city becoming the first special economic zone of China due to its close proximity to Hong Kong, attracting [[foreign direct investment]] and migrants searching for opportunities. In thirty years, the city's economy and population boomed and has since emerged as a hub for technology, international trade, and finance.

Shenzhen is the home to the [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange]], one of the [[List of stock exchanges|largest stock exchanges in the world]] by market capitalization and the [[Guangdong Free-Trade Zone]]. Shenzhen is ranked as an Alpha- ([[Global city|global first-tier]]) city by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]]. Its nominal GDP has surpassed those of its neighboring cities of [[Guangzhou]] and Hong Kong and is now among those of the cities with the ten largest economies in the world. Shenzhen also has the [[Global Financial Centres Index|eighth]] most competitive and largest financial center in the world, the seventh-most [[Fortune Global 500]] headquarters, [[List of cities by number of billionaires|fifth-highest number of billionaires]], [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|the second largest number of skyscrapers]], the [[List of cities by scientific output|19th largest scientific research output]], and [[List of universities and colleges in Guangdong|several higher education institutions]], including [[Shenzhen University]], [[Southern University of Science and Technology]], and [[Shenzhen Technology University]]. [[Shenzhen railway station]] was the last stop on the mainland Chinese section of the [[Kowloon–Canton Railway]].

The city is a leading global technology hub. In the media Shenzhen is sometimes called ''China's [[Silicon Valley]]''.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> The city's entrepreneurial, innovative, and competitive-based culture has resulted in the city being home to numerous small manufacturers and software companies. Several of these firms have become large technology corporations, such as [[Huawei]], [[Tencent]], and [[DJI]]. As an important international city, Shenzhen hosts numerous national and international events every year, such as the [[2011 Summer Universiade]] and the China Hi-Tech Fair.

A large portion of Shenzhen's population are [[Migration in China|migrants]] from all over China, and the city's population structure skews younger than most places in China.

In January 1978, a Central Inspection Team sent by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] investigated and established the issue of creating a foreign trade port in Bao'an County.<ref name="HuizhouMuniCommittee-2015">{{cite web|url=http://www.szb.sz.gov.cn/szjyj/201512/t20151207_3382696.htm|script-title=zh:深圳特区建立过程中惠阳地区的历史作用|date=2015-12-07|work=中共惠州市委党史研究室课题组|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418220707/http://www.szb.sz.gov.cn/szjyj/201512/t20151207_3382696.htm|archive-date=2017-04-18|url-status=live}}</ref> In May, the investigation team wrote the "Hong Kong and Macao Economic Investigation Report" and proposed to turn Bao'an County and [[Zhuhai]] into commodity export bases.

On 18 October, the Standing Committee of the [[Guangdong]] Provincial Party Committee decided to change Bao'an County into Bao'an City and to turn it into a medium-level [[prefecture-level city]] with a foreign trade base. The Huiyang District Committee and the Bao'an County Committee, however, defended the change to rename Bao'an County to Shenzhen, claiming that people in the world know more about Shenzhen and its port than they know about Bao'an County.

On 23 January 1979, the [[Guangdong]] provincial administration and the district of [[Huiyang District|Huiyang]] announced their proposal to rename Bao'an County to Shenzhen and was approved and put into effect by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] on March 5 of that year.<ref name="HuizhouMuniCommittee-2015" /> Also, the city would establish six districts: [[Luohu District|Luohu]], Nantou, Songgang, [[Longhua District, Shenzhen|Longhua]], [[Longgang District, Shenzhen|Longgang]] and Kuiyong.

Shenzhen roughly follows the administrative boundaries of the historical [[Bao'an County]]. The southern portion of Bao'an County became part of [[British Hong Kong]] after the [[Opium Wars]], while the village of Shenzhen was on the border. [[Shenzhen railway station]] was the last stop on the mainland Chinese section of the [[Kowloon–Canton Railway]], and Shenzhen's economy grew and it became a city by 1979.

Shenzhen is located within the [[Pearl River Delta]], bordering [[Hong Kong]] to the south, [[Huizhou]] to the north and northeast, [[Dongguan]] to the north and northwest. [[Lingdingyang]] and [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] to the west and [[Mirs Bay]] to the east and roughly {{convert|100|km}} southeast of the provincial capital of [[Guangzhou]]. As of the end of 2017, the resident population of Shenzhen was 12,528,300, of which the registered population was 4,472,200, the actual administrative population was over 20 million.<ref name="citypopulation.de">{{cite web|url=http://www.sz.gov.cn/cn/zjsz/gl/201808/t20180808_13857402.htm|trans-title=Shenzhen overview|script-title=zh:深圳概貌|access-date=25 Sep 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930231555/http://www.sz.gov.cn/cn/zjsz/gl/201808/t20180808_13857402.htm|archive-date=30 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It makes up part of the Pearl River Delta built-up area with 44,738,513 inhabitants, spread over 9 municipalities (including [[Macau]]).

=== Climate ===
[[File:Shenzhen 114.09549E 22.54895N.jpg|thumb|right|The urban area of Shenzhen in 2005]]
Although Shenzhen is situated about a degree south of the [[Tropic of Cancer]], due to the Siberian [[anticyclone]] it has a warm, [[monsoon]]-influenced, [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwa'') though it is fairly close to a [[Tropical]] one. Winters are mild and relatively dry, due in part to the influence of the [[South China Sea]], and frost is very rare; it begins dry but becomes progressively more humid and overcast. However, fog is most frequent in winter and spring, with 106 days per year reporting some fog. Early spring is the cloudiest time of year, and rainfall begins to dramatically increase in April; the rainy season lasts until late September to early October. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 27 percent in March to 53 percent in October, the city receives 1,853 hours of bright sunshine annually.

The monsoon reaches its peak intensity in the summer months, when the city also experiences very humid and hot conditions. Despite this, extreme heat is rare, there are only 2.4 days of {{convert|35|°C}}+ temperatures.<ref name = "SZMB via 21CMA"/> The region is prone to torrential rain as well, with 9.7 days that have {{convert|50|mm|2|abbr=on}} or more of rain, and 2.2 days of at least {{convert|100|mm|2|abbr=on}}.<ref name = "SZMB via 21CMA"/> The latter portion of autumn is dry. The annual precipitation averages at around {{convert|1933|mm|0|abbr=on}}, some of which is delivered in [[typhoon]]s that strike from the east during summer and early autumn. Extreme temperatures have ranged from {{convert|0.2|°C|0}} on 11 February 1957 to {{convert|38.7|°C|0}} on 10 July 1980.<ref name = Mherrera>{{cite web|url= http://www.mherrera.org/temp.htm|title= Extreme Temperatures Around the World|access-date= 4 February 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140804202145/http://www.mherrera.org/temp.htm|archive-date= 4 August 2014|url-status= live}}</ref>

Shenzhen was originally [[Bao'an County]]. On 5 March 1979, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] dissolved the county and set up the city of Shenzhen in its place initially with six districts: Luohu ({{Lang-zh|c=罗湖|labels=no}}), Nantou ({{Lang-zh|c=南头|labels=no}}), Songgang ({{Lang-zh|c=松岗|labels=no}}), Longhua ({{Lang-zh|c=龙华|labels=no}}), Longgang ({{Lang-zh|c=龙岗|labels=no}}), and Kuiyong ({{Lang-zh|c=葵涌|labels=no}}), with the seat based in Luohu. In October 1981, Bao'an County was re-established, with its region now based outside Shenzhen. In June 1983, the districts were dissolved and re-established instead as five management areas ({{Lang-zh|c=管理区|labels=no}}): [[Shekou]] ({{Lang-zh|c=蛇口|labels=no}}; south-west Shenzhen), Nantou ({{Lang-zh|c=南头|labels=no}}; west Shenzhen), Shangbu ({{Lang-zh|c=上步|labels=no}}; central Shenzhen), Luohu ({{Lang-zh|c=罗湖|labels=no}}; east-central Shenzhen), and Shatoujiao ({{Lang-zh|c=沙头角|labels=no}}; far-east Shenzhen).<ref name="ShezhenHistory-2011">{{Cite web|date=2011-07-12|title=深圳市宝安区历史变迁|url=http://www.baoanhao.com/bendi/info-41695.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109105546/http://www.baoanhao.com/bendi/info-41695.html|archive-date=2011-11-09|access-date=2021-06-07|website=宝安在线}}</ref> To enforce law and order in the city, the Shenzhen government erected a border known as the second line ({{zh|c=二线关|t=|s=|p=}}), which consisted of barbed wire and checkpoints between the city and the rest of China.<ref name="Southern Metropolis Daily-2014" /><ref name="exg1" /> Initially, the border control was relatively strict, requiring non-Shenzhen citizens to obtain special permissions for entering. Over the years, border controls have gradually weakened, and permission requirement has been abandoned.

In January 1990, the city merged Shekou Management Area and Nantou Management Area to form the [[Nanshan District, Shenzhen|Nanshan District]], renamed Shangbu Management Area to the [[Futian District]], and merged Luohu Management Area and Shatoujiao Management Area to form the [[Luohu District]]. In December 1992, Bao'an County was dissolved again, with its area taken by Shenzhen and split into two new districts: [[Bao'an District]] and [[Longgang District, Shenzhen|Longgang District]], though economic privileges within special economics zones did not pertain to them as they were outside the second line border. At this point, Shenzhen has five districts: Luohu, Futian, Nanshan, Bao'an, and Longgang. In March 1998, Shenzhen's government created the [[Yantian District]] from the eastern portions of the Luohu District (the original area of the Shatoujiao Management District), and within the second line border.<ref name="ShezhenHistory-2011" /> Yantian, Luohu, Futian, and Nanshan together as the special economic districts within the second line border are referred to as ''guannei'' ({{Lang-zh|c=关内|labels=no|l=within the border}}) while districts that are outside the second line and do not have special economic privileges such as Bao'an and Longgang are referred to as ''guanwai'' ({{Lang-zh|c=关外|labels=no|l=outside the border}}).<ref name="Zaidian-2016">{{cite web|script-title=zh:深圳规划合并关内关外取消区级政府|url=http://www.zaidian.com/show/DJdQnVNZwxowBDlf.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918204226/http://www.zaidian.com/show/DJdQnVNZwxowBDlf.html|archive-date=18 September 2016|access-date=10 September 2016}}</ref> The Shenzhen government later established two new districts as part of the ''guanwai'': [[Guangming District|Guangming New District]] in August 2007 and [[Pingshan District, Shenzhen|Pingshan New District]] in June 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2016-09-01|title=光明新区分设6个办事处|work=深圳商报|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/o/2016-09-01/doc-ifxvqefm5240640.shtml|url-status=dead|access-date=2021-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915163544/http://news.sina.com.cn/o/2016-09-01/doc-ifxvqefm5240640.shtml|archive-date=2016-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=2009-07-01|title=深圳市坪山新区正式成立|work=新华网|url=http://www.gd.xinhuanet.com/sungov/2009-07/01/content_16964247.htm|url-status=dead|access-date=2021-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304103237/http://www.gd.xinhuanet.com/sungov/2009-07/01/content_16964247.htm|archive-date=2016-03-04}}</ref>

On 1 July 2010, the second line border was dissolved, and the Shenzhen SEZ was expanded to cover the entire city.

In 2014, Shenzhen experienced severe water pollution in the city's rivers and waterways, with 173 of the 310 rivers considered to be in "critical" condition and four rivers: the Maozhou, Guanlan, Longgang and Pingshan Rivers, to be the most polluted out of all rivers in the Pearl River Delta. The pollutants in the river consisted mainly of ammonia, phosphorus, and nitrogen. In response, the city conducted a campaign to restore the city's rivers by building more water pipes and sewage treatment plants.<ref name="SCMorningPost-2014" /><ref name="Shenzhen.gov-2021b" />

The area encompassed by Shenzhen and [[Hong Kong]] formerly belonged to [[Bao'an County]] in imperial times.

According to then-[[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]] member [[Leung Chun-ying]], the two cities' close relationship can be due to the close distance between the two, similar economic systems, differences in wages and price levels, and that the two cities have different systems compared to other Chinese cities, with Hong Kong embracing the [[one country, two systems]] principle while Shenzhen is a [[Special economic zones of China|SEZ]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Leung|first=Chun-ying|date=2010-09-07|title=深港关系30年变迁的启示|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/gangao/2010-09/07/c_12526382.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011054503/http://news.xinhuanet.com/gangao/2010-09/07/c_12526382.htm|archive-date=2016-10-11|access-date=2021-06-21|website=[[Xinhua]]}}</ref>
