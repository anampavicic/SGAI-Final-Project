'''Nabatieh''' ({{langx|ar|النبطية|links=no}}, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Nabaṭiyya}}'', [[Syriac language|Syriac-Aramaic]]: ܐܠܢܒܛܝܥ), or '''Nabatîyé''' ({{IPA|ar|ˈnabatˤɪje|IPA}}), is the city of the [[Nabatieh Governorate]], in southern [[Lebanon]]. The population is not accurately known as by as no census has been taken in Lebanon since the 1930s; estimates range from 15,000 to 120,000. A 2006 population estimate by the now-closed German population site called World Gazetteer put the population at 100,541, which would make it the fifth largest city in Lebanon, according to the 2006 population estimates of Lebanese cities,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gcis&lng=en&dat=32&srt=npan&col=aohdq&geo=-124 |title=World Gazetteer: Lebanon - largest cities (Per geographical entity) |access-date=2006-03-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20060316122930/http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gcis&lng=en&dat=32&srt=npan&col=aohdq&geo=-124 |archive-date=2006-03-16 }}</ref> but after an update in either 2007 or 2008 and calculations for the following years the 2013 population estimate turned out to be much lower at 36,593 and making the city the 11th largest in Lebanon behind [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Bint Jbeil]], [[Zahlé]], [[Sidon]], [[Baalbek]], [[Jounieh]], [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] and [[Beirut]] according to those 2013 estimates.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=1364642577&men=gcis&lng=en&des=wg&geo=-124&srt=pnan&col=adhoq&msz=1500&pt=c&va=&srt=pnan |title=World Gazetteer: Lebanon - largest cities (Per geographical entity) |access-date=2015-08-03 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130625095437/http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=1364642577&men=gcis&lng=en&des=wg&geo=-124&srt=pnan&col=adhoq&msz=1500&pt=c&va=&srt=pnan |archive-date=2013-06-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It is the main city in the [[Jabal Amel]] area and the chief center for both the [[mohafazat]], or governorate, and the [[kaza]], or [https://fedleb.org/glossary/canton/ canton] both also called Nabatieh. Nabatieh is an important town both economically and culturally.

A market is held every Monday where traders and visitors from neighbouring villages gather in the centre of the town to exchange their goods in an area known in Arabic as the [[Souq|Souq Al Tanen]]. There are also branches of several banks, hospitals, restaurants and cultural centres of interest to tourists. Every year, the city commemorates the [[Battle of Karbala]] to remember the martyrdom of [[Husayn ibn Ali|Imam al Husayn]].

Nabatieh is the birthplace of several scholars, including [[linguist]] and Arab nationalist leader [[Ahmad Rida]], [[historian]] [[Muhammad Jaber Al Safa]], scientist [[Hassan Kamel Al-Sabbah]] (nephew of [[Ahmad Rida]]) and theologian Sheikh [[Ahmed Aref El-Zein]].

The most accepted theory is related to the [[Nabataeans|Nabateans]] (spelled النبطي), an ancient Arab 
civilization that inhabited northern Arabia and the southern [[Levant]]. The name of the city 
colloquially is, النبطية meaning in a broader linguistic sense “the Nabatean” in a feminine form, a 
form which would have been used to name cities (e.g. [[Alexandria|Alexandria, Egypt]]). <ref name="academia.edu">{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/118014974 | title=History of Nabatieh, Lebanon (Prehistory to Antiquity) | last1=Kesserwani | first1=Ali }}</ref>

Alternatively, this form of the word may have been in the genitive case as well due to the 
presence of a definite article. In addition, the feminization may have been used for noun 
agreement, therefore the city may have been referred to in some variation by its early inhabitants 
as القرية النبطية , "the village of the [[Nabataeans|Nabateans]]” or possibly some other toponym using the feminine 
form. Due to the city’s possible origins as a trading outpost (explained below), it could have also 
been السوق النبطية "the market of the Nabateans”, or some other variant which would have 
gradually been reduced to simply النبطية. <ref name="academia.edu">{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/118014974 | title=History of Nabatieh, Lebanon (Prehistory to Antiquity) | last1=Kesserwani | first1=Ali }}</ref>

The [[Nabataean Kingdom|Nabatean Kingdom]] (3rd century BC – 106 AD) extended its greatest height 
between 85-71 BC in which they controlled [[Damascus]]. Between this period and the [[Roman Empire|Roman period]], there have been instances of Nabatean inscriptions and coinage in [[Sidon]], which would 
have been the closest major port to Nabatieh. Therefore, being in the hinterland and at the 
foothills of the [[Mount Lebanon|Lebanon mountains]] between [[Sidon]] and [[Damascus]], the city may have been a 
trading stop or station for the Nabateans, thereby owing its name to them. One modern tradition 
that may have carried over from this ancient foundation is the weekly [[souk]] (souq el-tanen) which 
takes place every Monday and merchants from surrounding villages come to sell their goods. <ref name="academia.edu">{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/118014974 | title=History of Nabatieh, Lebanon (Prehistory to Antiquity) | last1=Kesserwani | first1=Ali }}</ref>

==History==
===Antiquity===
While the area has been inhabited since the [[Neolithic era]] (see [[Kfar Tebnit]]), the greatest archaeological discovery in the area to date occurred in the 1920s by [[Pierre Paul-Émile Guigues]]  while surveying necropolises in the area. Giugues found two [[Phoenician arrowheads|arrowheads]], one of which had a Phoenician inscription (KAI 20) which reads: arrow of Addo, son of Akki. This arrowhead was dated based on its paleography to the 10th century BCE. <ref name="Guigues 2021 pp. 323–328">{{Cite journal | last=Guigues | first=Pierre Paul-Émile | title=Pointe de flèche en bronze à inscription phénicienne | journal=Mélanges de l'Université Saint-Joseph | volume=11 | issue=1 | date=2021-10-18 | doi=10.3406/mefao.1926.990 | pages=323–328 | url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/mefao_0253-164x_1926_num_11_1_990 | language=fr | access-date=2022-07-23|quote=Au lieu dit Roueisseh, près de  [[Nabatieh Fawka|Nabatiyet el-fôqa]], à gauche de la route [[Sidon|Saïda-Gedeideh]] [[Marjayoun|Marg'ayoun]], qui traverse l’immense atelier préhistorique de [[Beaufort Castle, Lebanon|Qal'at-es-saqîf]], j’ai, au cours d'une mission d’exploration et de sondages archéologiques (1), procédé à une reconnaissance préliminaire de la nécropole sise à cet endroit.}}</ref> It is currently housed in the [[Louvre]]. <ref>{{cite web | url=https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010143583 | title=Pointe de flèche }}</ref>
Guigues also claimed that the tomb in which the arrows were found was reused into the [[Hellenistic period]]. This discovery occurred on a [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] between lower and upper Nabatieh called “el-Ruwisseh” (area of what is now [[Ned el-Shqif]]).<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/118014974 | title=History of Nabatieh, Lebanon (Prehistory to Antiquity) | last1=Kesserwani | first1=Ali }}</ref>

===Ottoman era===
In the 1596 [[daftar|tax records]], it was named ''Nabatiyya al-Tahta'', located in the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] ''[[nahiya]]'' (subdistrict) of Sagif under the ''[[Liwa (Arabic)|liwa'<nowiki/>]]'' (district) of [[Safad]], with a population of 151 households and 28 bachelors, all Muslim. The villagers paid taxes on goats and beehives, "occasional revenues", a press for olive oil or grape syrup, a market toll, and a fixed sum; a total of 9,030 [[akçe]].<ref name="Hutteroth">Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 185</ref><ref>Note that Rhode, 1979, p.

In 1875, [[Victor Guérin]] found Nabatieh et-Tahta ("The lower Nabatieh") to have 1,500 [[Metuali]] inhabitants, in addition to 300 Christians; mostly Greek Orthodox, but also some [[Maronite]]s.<ref>Guérin, 1880, p. [https://archive.org/stream/descriptiongogr00gugoog#page/n560/mode/1up 520]</ref>

===Lebanese civil war===
During Israel’s first full scale invasion of Lebanon, [[Operation Litani]], March 1978, most of the population of Nabatieh fled their homes in a bombardment that, according to the [[New York Times]], left “[h]ardly a house [ ] intact”. The 20 March report continues “There are only 25 to 30 families left in the once prosperous farm center of 40,000 inhabitants”.<ref> [[Fouad Ajami|Ajami, Fouad]] (1986) ''The vanished Imam : Musa al Sadr and the Shia of Lebanon''.

===South Lebanon conflict===
Following the [[1982 Lebanon War|1982 Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon]], in October 1983 an [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) convoy drove into Nabatieh at the height of the [[Ashura]] celebrations. In the ensuing confrontation a jeep was overturned and set on fire. The soldiers responded with rifle fire and grenades and one person was killed and several wounded. This incident, as well as the assassination of Sheikh [[Ragheb Harb]], is seen as the turning point in the Shia community’s relationship with the occupying Israelis.<ref>[[David Hirst (journalist)|Hirst, David]] (2010) ''Beware of Small States.

After Israel’s withdrawal in 1985 Nabatieh was on the edge of the so-called [[Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon|security zone]]. 

On 24 August 1989 an [[Israeli Air Force|IAF]] air strike on [[Ain Abu Suwar]] near Nabatieh killed nine people. Reports stated that the dead were refugees from the [[War of Liberation (1989–1990)|fighting]] in [[Beirut]].<ref>[[Middle East International]] No 358, 8 September 1989, Publishers [[Christopher Mayhew|Lord Mayhew]], [[Dennis Walters|Dennis Walters MP]]; Fourteen days in brief p.14</ref> In early December the same year Nabatieh was shelled for three days by the [[South Lebanon Army]].

On 14 March 1995 the Lebanese [[Council of Ministers of Lebanon|cabinet]] held a symbolic session in Nabatieh to mark the 14th anniversary of the [[Operation Litani|1978 invasion]]. The meeting called for the implementation of the seventeen year old [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 425]].<ref>Middle East International No 496, 17 March 1995; [[Jim Muir]] pp.3-4</ref> Later that year, 8 July, two teenage sisters and their four-year-old brother were killed when the town was hit by anti-personnel shells filled with [[Flechette#Rocket and artillery use|steel darts]], which are banned by the [[Geneva Conventions]].

==Historic structures==

===Beaufort Castle===
{{Main|Beaufort Castle, Lebanon}}
On the top of a hill overlooking the southern [[Beqaa Valley]] towards [[Damascus]] stands Belfort or [[Beaufort Castle, Lebanon|Beaufort castle]], known in Arabic as Shqif Arnun, the word ''shqif'' being a Syriac term meaning high rock. The castle, although looking inaccessible, can be reached with little difficulty from the village of [[Arnoun]], which lies {{convert|7|km}} southeast of Nabatieh. There is no conclusive evidence for the age of this castle or for who built it.

==Mosques==
Nabatieh has two historic mosques. One was built in the 16th century and is in the centre of the town. Another, known as "the Mosque of the Prophet," dates to the [[Mamluk Sultanate|Mamluk]] period and is located in [[Nabatieh al Fawqa]].

==Education==
[[Mission laïque française]] [[Lycée Franco-Libanais Habbouche-Nabatieh]] is located few km to the north of the city. [[The National Evangelical School in Nabatieh|The National Evangelical School]] (Known Previously as American School for Girls in Nabatieh)   The Christian College [[Notre Dame des Soeurs Antonines]] is one of the oldest institutions in the city.<ref>[http://www.parliament.gov.lb/Presidency/Nachatat/mawakef/mawakef%2030-6-2003.htm College Notre Dame des Soeurs Antonines]{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{flagicon|Lebanon}} (Arabic)</ref>
