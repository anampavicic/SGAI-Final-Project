==Etymology==
'''Ad-Deir''' is a common shorthand for Deir ez-Zor. In [[Syriac language|Syriac]], Zeʿūrta ([https://glosbe.com/arc/en/%DC%99%DC%A5%DC%98%DC%AA%DC%AC%DC%90 ܙܥܘܪܬܐ]) means "little"; hence, ''Dīrā Zeʿūrta'' means "small habitation".<ref>R. Payne Smith, ''Thesaurus Syriacus'', s.v. ܕܝܪܐ; ܙܥܘܪܬܐ</ref> The current name, which has been extended to the surrounding region, indicates an ancient site for one of the [[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] secluded monasteries spread since the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution times]] and [[Apostolic Age]] throughout [[Mesopotamia]].<ref>Moffett, S. H. (1992): ''A History of Christianity in Asia: Beginnings to 1500''. Harper, San Francisco. {{ISBN|0-06-065779-0}}</ref> Although '''Deir''' ([[wikt:ܕܝܪܐ|ܕܝܪܐ]]), which is Arabic (borrowed from Syriac) for "monastery", is believed to have been kept throughout the various [[Medieval]] and [[modern age]] renamings, '''Zor''', which indicates the riverbank bush, appeared only in some late Ottoman records of the [[Deir ez-Zor Vilayet]].<ref>Shaw, S.

===Ancient history===
{{Further|Dura-Europos|Mari, Syria|Circesium}}
[[File:Duraeuropa-1-.gif|180px|thumb|right|From the discoveries of [[Dura-Europos]] to the southeast of Deir ez-Zor.]]
[[Archaeological]] findings in Deir ez-Zor indicate that the area has been inhabited since the ninth millennium BC. While the current location of the city has not always had a significant population, it was always an urban area, usually subordinate to more powerful cities, such as kingdoms like the Kingdom of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], which rose in the third millennium BC.<ref name=":2"/>

During the third millennium BC, the [[Amorites]] settled the area and established the kingdom of [[Yamhad]], one of whose urban centers was the city of Deir Ez-Zor (alongside [[Mayadeen]], Qars, and Tarka and its capital of [[Aleppo]]). The city didn't suffer during the succession of major empires (such as the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] and [[Assyrian Empire]]) when some military campaigns by the emperors were destroying entire urban centers for fear of future [[rebellion]], as Deir al-Zour was too small to be considered a threat.<ref name=":2"/>

In the third century BC, [[Alexander the Great]] crossed the region and built the city of [[Dura-Europos]]. Although influenced by [[Greek culture]], the [[Aramaic]] language remained prevalent in the city. When [[Syria (region)|Syria]] came under the [[Roman Empire]] in 64 BC, Deir Ez-Zor was a small, marginal village known as Azdra, which the Romans made the center of the region and founded a strong military garrison. Deir Ez-Zor came under the reign of Queen [[Zenobia]] of Palmyra in the third century, within an autonomous federation of the Roman Empire.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/HdarhWadyAlfrataea|title=The civilization of the Euphrates Valley|last=Ayyash|first=Abdul Qader|publisher=Ahali for printing, publishing and distribution|year=1989|location=Syria – Damascus|pages=149}}</ref>

=== Muslim conquest ===
{{Further|Iyad ibn Ghanm#Conquest of Upper Mesopotamia}}
[[File:Mohammad adil-Khalid's(r.a) route to Syria-ar.png|180px|thumb|right|A map showing the march of [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]]'s army from [[Iraq]] to [[the Levant]].]]
[[File:Al-Jazira.svg|thumb|right|180px|A map of [[Upper Mesopotamia|al-Jazira]] region (Upper Mesopotamia) in the 8th century. [[Iyad ibn Ghanm|Iyad]] played a leading role in the Muslim conquest of the region.]]
After the end of the [[Ridda wars]] in the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Abu Bakr]] sent four armies to [[the Levant]], led by [[Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan]], [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah]], [[Amr ibn al-Aas]], and [[Shurahbil ibn Hasana]]. Because of the strength and size of the armies of the [[Byzantine Empire]], Abu Bakr ordered [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] to march with half of the Iraqi army to the Levant and command the armies there.

Khalid set off with his army towards Sham and opened [[Bosra Sham|Bosra]] and then defeated the Byzantines at the [[Battle of Ajnadayn]]. After [[Umar ibn Al-Khattab]] became [[caliph]] in 13 AH (634 AD), Khalid was replaced by [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah]]. Abu Ubaidah was ordered to complete the [[Early Muslim conquests|conquest]]. He took [[Damascus]], [[Baalbek]], [[Homs]], [[Hama]] and [[Latakia]].

After the successive defeats of the [[Byzantine army]], the [[Byzantine Emperor Heraclius]] requested the help of the [[Arab Christians]] in [[Mesopotamia]]. They mobilized a large army and headed towards Homs, now the base of Abu Ubaidah in northern [[Syria (region)|Syria]], which they besieged. Heraclius also sent soldiers from [[Alexandria]]. [[Omar ibn al-Khattab]] wrote to [[Saad ibn Abi Waqqas]] to request support Abu Ubaidah with forces from Iraq, who were then organized under [[Iyad ibn Ghanm]]. When the Byzantines who were besieging Homs heard about the army coming from Iraq, they withdrew from Homs. Saad ordered Iyad to invade [[Upper Mesopotamia]], which he conquered in 17 AH, including Deir Ez-Zor.

At the time, Deir Ez-Zor were adherents of Christianity and Judaism. There was a [[Christian monastery]] in Monastery of the Hermits, which became Omari Mosque. Many of the town's Christians left or converted to [[Islam]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/757_201809/%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%A9%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%82-%20%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%B1%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%B1%20-%D8%A8%D9%82%D9%84%D9%80%D9%85%20%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%85%20%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A#page/n1/mode/2up|title=Deir Ezzor|last=Nouri|first=Abdel Karim|publisher=Al-Mashreq Magazine|year=1907|pages=38}}</ref>

During the [[Abbasid]] era, Deir Ez-Zor grew. The agriculture in the region prospered because of advances in irrigation. The small town, now called 'Deir Al-Rumman,' did not record any significant events during the decline of the Abbasid state and the ensuing [[Mamluk]] period until its destruction by the [[Mongols]] in the thirteenth century.<ref name=":2"/>

===Ottoman Era===
{{Further|Ottoman Syria}}
[[File:OttomanEmpire1566.png|180px|right|thumb|The extent of the Ottoman Empire in 1566, upon the death of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].]]

====First Ottoman Era (1517–1864)====
[[File:Portrait d'Ibrahim Pacha 2.JPG|180px|right|thumb|[[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], the ruler of Syria (1831–1840).]]
The first [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era extended from the date the [[Ottoman Syria|Ottomans]] entered Syria in 1517 until 1864, where the Ottomans found Deir Ez-Zor a small town on the upper [[Euphrates]] and chose it as a center for their employees and settled in some of tribal [[sheikh]]s to protect the trade route between [[Aleppo]] and [[Baghdad]] and The tribe members began to visit it to communicate the men of power and buy their needs.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/HdarhWadyAlfrataea|title=The civilization of the Euphrates Valley|last=Ayyash|first=Abdul Qader|publisher=Ahali for printing, publishing and distribution|year=1989|location=Syria – Damascus|pages=148}}</ref>

Some Arab and European travelers visited it and described its construction, economy, and the nature of its inhabitants. According to the description, "Its houses are adjacent over an artificial hill, and its inhabitants are strong, polite, and welcome guests. Their crops were wheat, barley, cotton, and corn, along with orchards full of fruit species, including [[Palm tree|palm]] trees, lemons, and oranges, the chess game is common among elders".<ref name=":2"/>

Deir Ez-Zor has repeatedly been subjected to [[Bedouin]] attacks for looting and has been greatly affected by these attacks, including the attacks of [[Wahhabis]] in 1807; it was repeatedly plundered and destroyed by the Bedouin because the [[Ottoman Empire]] had not subdued them as it was preoccupied with its wars and the corruption of its [[Sultans of the Ottoman Empire|sultans]] and officials. The city's people armed themselves with guns and organized a national army to defend the city resulting in the decline of the Bedouin attacks. Still, its negative effects were the shrinking of the city. Still, the isolation benefited the city's people because they relied on themselves to make many of their needs and those of neighboring villages, such as axes, spears, swords, gunpowder, and weaving cotton.<ref name=":2"/>

When security was relatively stable, the commercial convoys started passing through the area, and Deir ez-Zor was a station for them, providing them with food, feed, and comfort. The [[Caravanserai|khans]] were established in it, and the road between [[Aleppo]] and [[Baghdad]] began to revive it and get it out of isolation. Young people start traveling to [[Hauran]] with the beginning of the spring for trading or work and then return in the early fall; they also travel to [[Aleppo]], Baghdad, [[Mardin]] and [[Urfa]] for trading.<ref name=":2"/>

In 1831 Ibrahim Pasha took over Deir ez-Zor and annexed it to [[Hama Sanjak]] and appointed Maejun Agha governor of the city, [[Egyptian Army|Egyptian]] rule remained until 1840 when the authority of the [[Ottoman Syria|Ottoman]] returned to the city, Perhaps the most prominent feature of Ibrahim Pasha's rule is the proliferation of weapons among the city's inhabitants, especially rifles, known as "Brahimiyat," which constituted a major tool to defend the city and repel [[Bedouin]] attacks.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/HdarhWadyAlfrataea|title=The civilization of the Euphrates Valley|last=Ayyash|first=Abdul Qader|publisher=Ahali for printing, publishing and distribution|year=1989|location=Syria – Damascus|pages=150}}</ref>

====Second Ottoman Era (1864–1918)====
=====Zor Sanjak=====
{{Further|Zor Sanjak}}
[[File:Ottoman Syria 1900.svg|180px|thumb|right|Ottoman Syria until World War I. Present borders in grey.]]
On 2 January 1858, the [[Ottoman Syria|Ottoman]] government launched a military campaign under the command of Omar Pasha (Croatian) consisting of 500 soldiers to subdue the tribes in the Euphrates region. The campaign reached Deir Ez-Zor city and fought against the city's residents, where 16 Ottoman soldiers were killed. After the [[Ottoman army]] subdued the city, Omar Pasha recruited 16 young men from the city to replace the Ottoman soldiers killed.<ref name="Ayyash 1989 152">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/HdarhWadyAlfrataea|title=The civilization of the Euphrates Valley|last=Ayyash|first=Abdul Qader|publisher=Ahali for printing, publishing and distribution |year=1989 |location=Syria – Damascus|pages=152}}</ref>

In 1864 the city revolted against Ottoman rule, and Soraya Pasha, the governor of Aleppo, sent a military force to suppress it. After the campaign, Soraya Pasha came to Deir ez-Zor He made it the center of the district's headquarters ([[Qaimaqam|Qaimakamiyya]]), and he returned to Aleppo after appointing Omar Pasha governor, whose rule did not last more than 6 months. Khalil Bey Saqib was appointed as [[Kaymakam]] of Deir ez-Zor after it was annexed to Aleppo.

During his reign, it established the government house (Dar Al Saraya), a military barracks, a hospital and some trade markets. Some of the arrivals from [[Urfa]] settled in the city to help Khalil Bey Saqib with the administration, as well as starting campaigns to settle the Bedouin in urban centers on the Euphrates.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/HdarhWadyAlfrataea|title=The civilization of the Euphrates Valley|last=Ayyash|first=Abdul Qader|publisher=Ahali for printing, publishing and distribution |year=1989 |location=Syria – Damascus|pages=151}}</ref>

In 1868, the [[Qaimaqam|Qaimakamiyya]] was transformed to the [[Zor Sanjak]], which did not report to the [[wali]] but reported directly to the [[Grand Vizier]] in [[Istanbul]]. Its ruler ([[Mutasarrıf]]) was granted wide powers and its area was extended to include the city of [[Raqqa]] and [[Hasakah]].<ref name="Ayyash 1989 152"/>

The rulers ([[Mutasarrıf]]s) solidified security, especially during Arslan Pasha's reign, and were interested in organizing and planning the city, building schools and streets and established the first public park. They also built bridges on the Euphrates and some mosques and encouraged [[afforestation]] and they used boats to cross the Euphrates. They reformed the tax system and introduced European uniforms into the city and did not generalize it.

The era of the [[Zor Sanjak]] lasted 54 years, where 29 [[Mutasarrıf]]s successively ruled it, the most recent being Hilmi Bey, who left the city with the Ottoman army on 6 November 1918. The continuous change of rulers (Mutasarrıfs) and lack of resources and disruption of conditions in the Ottoman empire affected negatively on the urban, economic, cultural and social activity of the city. The outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 brought calamities, with many young people being recruited, famine] and disease spread, livelihoods were confiscated, trade stopped and agriculture declined. But in the opinion of historian Abdul Qadir Ayyash, Deir ez-Zor owed its civilization to the Ottoman rulers despite their mistakes.<ref name="Ayyash 1989 152"/>

===Armenian genocide===

At the beginning of [[World War I]] in 1914, the Ottoman empire began systematic campaigns to kill and displace [[Armenians]]. Beginning April 1915, this was carried out through massacres, forced deportations, and displacement, which were marches under harsh conditions designed to lead to the death of the deportees. Researchers estimate the number of Armenian victims as between 1 million and 1.5&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.armenian-genocide.org/Affirmation.169/current_category.6/affirmation_detail.html|title=United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities |date=2 July 1985|website=Armenian genocide}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Fuat Dündar |editor=Ronald Grigor Suny |editor2=Fatma Muge Gocek |editor3=Norman M.

Deir ez-Zor was the last destination of the forced displacement of Armenian convoys and the scene of killings and slaughter by the Turkish [[gendarmerie]], where the [[Ottoman Syria|Ottoman]] authorities planned to exterminate Armenians. These plans failed because the people of Deir ez-Zor regretted what happened to the Armenian men, women, and children, prompting the mayor Haj [[Fadel Al-Aboud]] to help protect them and provide them with food, housing, safety and livelihoods.<ref>{{cite news|title=Armenians in Deir ez-Zor, Syria|url=http://khabararmani.com/?p=1674|work=khabararmani|date=17 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Hanna|first1=Abdullah|title=How the Syrians narrated the Armenian tragedy in 1915 and dealt with it|url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/diffah/print//revisions/2018/3/8/%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B1%D9%85%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85-1915%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A7-%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%87%D8%A7|work=Alaraby|date=9 March 2018}}</ref>

Despite Armenians coming to the region as part of death marches, the liberation that they achieved ultimately benefited the city, increasing population and growth rates. Historically, the city of Deir ez-Zor has been a special place for Armenians in [[Syria]] and the [[Armenian Diaspora]]. The [[Armenian Genocide Memorial Church, Der Zor|Armenian genocide Memorial Church]], which was officially built in 1991, includes a museum containing some remains, collectibles and maps for memory of the martyrs who died in that area by the [[Ottoman Turks]]. The city later became a pilgrimage destination for hundreds of thousands of Armenians on 24 April each year, after being declared in 2002 by [[Catholicos Aram I]] of the [[Armenian Orthodox]] of [[Cilicia]] as a pilgrimage to the Armenians.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Al-Ahmed|first1=Safwan|title=Deir Ezzor is free of Armenians in memory of their massacres|url=https://www.orient-news.net/ar/news_show/78826/0/%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B1%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%89-%D9%85%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%B1%D9%87%D9%85|work=Orient|date=26 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.armenian-genocide.org/Memorial.110/current_category.72/memorials_detail.html|title=Der Zor, Syria, Armenian Genocide Monument and Memorial Complex|website=www.armenian-genocide.org}}</ref>

Trouble broke out in the city of Deir al-Zour after the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] left on 6 November 1918, where people began looting and stealing from each other across the area, so it was necessary to have a strong authority for protecting the city and its people and that led Al-Hassan who was the mayor to form his first government in the city and asking all tribal leaders in the villages and surrounding districts to support him and pledge allegiance to him. One of the priorities of this government was maintain the security and running the affairs of the city. This government later known as the "[[Haj Fadel Government]]".<ref>[http://mouhassan.com/pages/62b64863162962764462864862e627628648631.php Bukhapur revolution with dates and evidence<span wudooh="true" style="font-size:1.1em;line-height:1.45em;font-family:&quot;Sahl Naskh&quot;;">، </span>Website Al-Muhasan City.]. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510220909/http://mouhassan.com/pages/62b64863162962764462864862e627628648631.php |date=10 May 2017 }}</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/HdarhWadyAlfrataea Alayyash<span wudooh="true" style="font-size:1.1em;line-height:1.45em;font-family:&quot;Sahl Naskh&quot;;">، </span>Abdul Qader<span wudooh="true" style="font-size:1.1em;line-height:1.45em;font-family:&quot;Sahl Naskh&quot;;">، </span>Prepare: Walid al-Mashouh<span wudooh="true" style="font-size:1.1em;line-height:1.45em;font-family:&quot;Sahl Naskh&quot;;">، </span>Hadarat Wady Alfurat <span wudooh="true" style="font-size:1.1em;line-height:1.45em;font-family:&quot;Sahl Naskh&quot;;">،</span>Al Ahali for printing publishing and distribution<span wudooh="true" style="font-size:1.1em;line-height:1.45em;font-family:&quot;Sahl Naskh&quot;;">، </span>First Edition<span wudooh="true" style="font-size:1.1em;line-height:1.45em;font-family:&quot;Sahl Naskh&quot;;">، 1989، </span>P 152.].</ref><ref name="Sabbagh 2017 34–35">{{Cite journal|last=Sabbagh|first=Rand|date=2017|title=Deir Ezzor a city on the banks of paradise|url=https://archive.org/details/malayyash_yahoo_All|journal=Al-Quds Al-Arabi Newspaper|volume=8789|pages=34–35}}</ref>

====British period====
On 11 January 1919, the [[British army]] occupied the city via the Iraqi border and annexed it to Iraqi territory. The British government took care of the security and cleanliness of the city and set up a primary school that started teaching English.

The people of Deir ez-Zor sought to get rid of British rule and wrote their wish to the [[Arab]] government in [[Damascus]], The Iraqi officers of the Iraqi "[[Al-'Ahd (Iraq)|Al-'Ahd Party]]" in Damascus wanted to occupy Deir ez-Zor to make it a base to liberate Iraq from the [[British occupation of Iraq|British occupation]]. So they appointed [[Ramadan al-Shallash]] as governor of [[Raqqa]] to be a step to liberate Deir ez-Zor, Officer Ramadan al-Shallash came and occupied Deir ez-Zor with the help of her people and "Albu Saraya" clan, and British troops withdrew on 27 December 1919 to the Iraqi border.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/HdarhWadyAlfrataea|title=The civilization of the Euphrates Valley|last=Ayyash|first=Abdul Qader|publisher=Ahali for printing, publishing and distribution|year=1989|location=Syria – Damascus|pages=153}}</ref>

====The Second government of Haj Fadel====
On 27 December 1919, Ramadan al-Shallash took over the administration of Deir Ez-Zor as a military ruler, and his authority was nominal and the real ruling was to the city's notables, and they were not satisfied with his actions. Hence, they took him out of the city after two months.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/HdarhWadyAlfrataea|title=The civilization of the Euphrates Valley|last=Ayyash|first=Abdul Qader|publisher=Ahali for printing, publishing and distribution|year=1989|location=Syria – Damascus|pages=154}}</ref>

After the [[Battle of Maysalun]] on 24 July 1920 and occupation of Damascus by the French forces, the city of Deir ez-Zor was in a state of chaos and insecurity, which prompted Al-Hassan to form his second government, Which has done great services in protecting the city and maintaining the security of its people despite its limited capabilities. This government continued its work until 23 November 1920, when it was dissolved by a decision of the French occupation authorities.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/HdarhWadyAlfrataea Alayyash<span wudooh="true" style="font-size:1.1em;line-height:1.45em;font-family:&quot;Sahl Naskh&quot;;">، </span>Abdul Qader<span wudooh="true" style="font-size:1.1em;line-height:1.45em;font-family:&quot;Sahl Naskh&quot;;">، </span>Prepare: Walid al-Mashouh<span wudooh="true" style="font-size:1.1em;line-height:1.45em;font-family:&quot;Sahl Naskh&quot;;">، </span>Hadarat Wady Alfurat <span wudooh="true" style="font-size:1.1em;line-height:1.45em;font-family:&quot;Sahl Naskh&quot;;">،</span>Al Ahali for printing publishing and distribution<span wudooh="true" style="font-size:1.1em;line-height:1.45em;font-family:&quot;Sahl Naskh&quot;;">، </span>First Edition<span wudooh="true" style="font-size:1.1em;line-height:1.45em;font-family:&quot;Sahl Naskh&quot;;">، 1989، </span>P 154.].</ref><ref name=":0">[https://archive.org/details/GreatBaqqaraTribe Alshamary, Anwar, Biggest Baggara Tribe, Dar Almaref, Homs, 1996, Page: 363.].</ref>

===French Mandate===

[[File:Général Gouraud 1923.jpg|thumb|right|180px|General [[Henri Gouraud (general)|Henri Gouraud]]]]
In July 1920, French General [[Henri Gouraud (general)|Henri Gouraud]] issued an ultimatum to the government of [[King Faisal I|King Faisal]], known as the "Gouraud ultimatum ", he set four days to accept it.

Although the Syrian government accepted the ultimatum and accepted the demands of General Gouraud to demobilize the Syrian army and withdraw the soldiers from the mounds of the village of [[Majdal Anjar]] in violation of the decision of the [[Syrian National Congress]], on 24 July 1920, French troops began to march on the orders of General Goubeier (By order of General Gouraud) towards Damascus, While the Syrian army stationed on the border was retreating, and when General Gouraud) asked about this matter, replied that Faisal's message by accepting the ultimatum had reached him after the deadline.

on 24 July 1920, the [[Battle of Maysalun]] ended with the loss of the Syrian army and the death of the [[Minister of War]] [[Yusuf al-'Azma]], After its control over the entire Syrian territory, France resorted to the fragmentation of Syria into several independent states or entities:

* [[State of Damascus]] (1920).
* [[State of Aleppo]] (1920).
* [[Alawite State]] (1920).
* [[Greater Lebanon|The State of Greater Lebanon]] (1920).
* [[Jabal Druze State]] (1921).
* [[Sanjak of Alexandretta]] (1921).

The city of Deir ez-Zor, [[Raqqa]] and [[Al-Hasakah]] were followed to [[Aleppo]].

When the [[French colonial forces]] entered Deir Ez-Zor on 9 November 1921, the region was locally ruled by Fadel Al-Aboud, a member of an aristocratic family; after a while, protests and demonstrations against occupation broke out, A group of French armored vehicles and dozens of soldiers encircled the house of Fadel Al-Aboud, where he was arrested and transferred to the military airport of Deir al-Zour and then transported by military aircraft to [[Aleppo]], where he was imprisoned in the [[Aleppo Citadel|castle]] and during his imprisonment he met with the leader [[Ibrahim Hanano]], In June 1922 he was released and returned to Deir Ez-Zor.<ref name="archive.org">[https://archive.org/stream/AbedAlqaderAyyash/AbedAlqader%20Ayyash#page/n5 Fattouh, Issa, Abdul Qader Ayyash Researcher and Historian, Almarifa Magazine, Ministry of Culture in the Syrian Arab Republic, No 646, year 56, July 2017, p 155.].</ref><ref name=":0" />

Later, Fadel Al-Aboud was sentenced to exile to the city of [[Jisr al-Shughour]] after he was accused of preparing a revolt against [[French colonialism]] in protest against the military campaign by the French army against the Bukhabur tribes that refused to pay taxes to the French colonizer, and insulting Wali Deir al-Zour Khalil Isaac, who was cooperating with the French.<ref>[https://archive.org/download/malayyash_yahoo_20170719_0614/%D9%85%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AD%D9%85_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AF_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B7%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A_%D9%81%D9%8A_%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%8A_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA.jpg Alnigress<span wudooh="true" style="font-size:1.1em;line-height:1.45em;font-family:&quot;Sahl Naskh&quot;;">، </span>Mahmoud<span wudooh="true" style="font-size:1.1em;line-height:1.45em;font-family:&quot;Sahl Naskh&quot;;">، </span>Bo Jimaa Bottel<span wudooh="true" style="font-size:1.1em;line-height:1.45em;font-family:&quot;Sahl Naskh&quot;;">، </span>Furat newspaper<span wudooh="true" style="font-size:1.1em;line-height:1.45em;font-family:&quot;Sahl Naskh&quot;;">، 2005.</span>].</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/malayyash_yahoo_All/all#page/n17 Sabbagh, Rend, Deir al-Zour city on the banks of Paradise, Al Quds Al Arabi, Twenty-eighth year, 09/04/2017 number 8789, page 34.].</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/download/WhollyExecutionFahallaAlsakal/Wholly_execution,_Fahalla_Alsakal.jpg Al-Saqal, Fathallah, wholesale execution, Manarat al-Furat magazine, 09/2009, p. 29.].</ref><ref name="archive.org"/>

In June 1922, under the pressure of the Syrian people and the continued demonstration, Gouraud declared the creation of a Syrian federation on a federal basis between Damascus, Aleppo, and [[Alawite state]], provided that the Federation should have a president elected for one non-renewable year, The council of the Federation held its first meeting in June 1922 in the city of Aleppo and issued resolution No. / 1 / to form the Federal Government, [[Subhi Barakat]], who is close to the French colonial authorities, was elected president of the federation.

Some Syrians working with the French at translation centers, and others were secretly at the service of the revolutionaries and reporting news and information to Mohammed ِAl-Ayyash about the situation and movements of the French and their activities and the timing of their military operations. This helped Al-Ayyash guides the revolutionaries to strike the French forces.

In early June 1925, the translators informed Mohammed Al-Ayyash that a military vehicle carrying four French officers from France to inspect the French military construction departments in Syria and [[Lebanon]] would leave accompanied by their French driver Deir Ez-Zor on its way to Aleppo. He instructed his brother Mahmoud to set up an ambush in Ain Albu Gomaa on the road between Deir Ez-Zor and [[Al-Raqqa]], where the highway runs through a profound valley and has a narrow stone bridge.<ref name="Sabbagh 2017 34–35"/><ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref name="Sheikh Khafaji 2018"/><ref name="Al-Shaheen 2009 753"/>

The French were incensed for losing contact with their officers and began an extensive campaign including planes to search for them and when they found their bodies and inquired from the informants about the names of the [[revolutionaries]], they sent a large military force equipped with heavy guns and planes to attack the Albu Saraya clan and blockade it.

[[French mandate of Syria|French]] planes began bombing the clan villages with a devastating bombardment where the houses were destroyed, as were children and women and killed. Livestock was destroyed, as well as farms and crops. Civilians were killed, among them "Hanash Al-Mousa Al-Ani," "Ali Al-Najras," and a pregnant woman, and many were wounded by bullets and shrapnel from Airplane bombs. All of this was to pressure the people to surrender the revolutionaries.

When the [[French mandate of Syria|French]] realised that the bombing did not convince the local people to give up the revolutionaries, they threatened to arrest the women of the revolutionaries, their mothers and sisters until the revolutionaries surrender themselves to the French, when the news arrived to the revolutionaries, they emerged from their hideouts and surrendered themselves to avoid arresting their women.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Souriatana|title=محمد العايش 1880 -1968|date=7 October 2012|via=Internet Archive}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marzouq|first=Yasser|date=2012|title=Mohammed Al-Ayesh|url=https://archive.org/details/Souriatana|journal=Syrianna Magazine|volume=55|pages=11}}</ref>

The revolutionaries were tried in [[Aleppo]], where The family of [[Ayyash Al-Haj]] appointed lawyer Fathallah Al-Saqqal to defend her; the court heard (officer Bono) head of the [[French intelligence]] in Deir Ez-Zor, who said: If each of the criminals, who committed this terrible offense deserve dying once, the gang leader Mohammed Al-Ayyash is deserving hanging twice.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="Fattouh 2017 153–159"/><ref name="Morshed 2016"/>

The city was neglected during the reign of the [[Mandatory Syrian Republic|first ٍSyrian republic]] and illiteracy was rampant by 95%. However, some achievements belonged to that stage, such as building the suspension bridge and the establishment of the first bank in addition to the palace of justice, the national library, the city museum, and the municipal stadium; during this period, literary and cultural clubs increased, electricity existed, and cafes became widespread.

The city participated vigorously in the sixtieth strike in 1936 and saw a large march on 10 February 1936; this strike led to the signing of the independence agreement between Syria and France and the arrival of the national bloc to power after parliamentary elections held at the end of the year in which three deputies represented the city.<ref name="Ayyash 1989 157">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/HdarhWadyAlfrataea|title=The civilization of the Euphrates Valley|last=Ayyash|first=Abdul Qader|publisher=Ahali for printing, publishing, and distribution|year=1989|location=Syria – Damascus|pages=157}}</ref>

In 1941, the twenty-fifth government was formed in the modern history of Syria and the tenth in the era of the [[Mandatory Syrian Republic|first Syrian Republic]]. The first after [[Taj al-Din al-Hasani|Taj al-Din al-Hassani]] became president. which gathered the various pillars of politics in Syria, during which the independence of Syria was proclaimed. The federal rule recognized the financial and administrative independence of [[Lattakia]] and [[Sweida]]. In this government, Mohammad Bey al-Ayesh took over [[Ministry of Economy|the Ministry of National Economy]] to be the first minister from Deir ez-Zor and the Eastern Province. after his tenure, it dedicated the tradition of allocating a ministerial seat to a [[bourgeoisie]] in Deir Ez-Zor in successive [[Syrian Government]]s. And in the same year (1941), British-led forces defeated the [[Vichy French]] during the [[Syria–Lebanon campaign]], which included a battle over Deir ez-Zor. They handed administration of the region to the [[Free French]].<ref name="Ayyash 1989 157"/><ref>Mackenzie, Compton (1951). Eastern Epic. London: Chatto & Windus. OCLC 1412578.P.122</ref>

The city has maintained its struggle and political role in addition to its civil activity even during the independence phase; in 1946, the wheat uprising against Governor Makram al-Atassi began due to the monopoly of the authority with the good wheat in the city, and the people succeeded in obtaining their rights.

In 1952 cotton cultivation was widespread, and automated pumping engines were introduced, which increased the area of arable land and cotton became the first crop of the city instead of wheat. The discovery of oil and salt during the reign of the second Syrian republic near the city helped to develop and expand urbanization and the increase the number of public and private companies that working in it, as well as increasing migration from the [[countryside]] towards it.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/HdarhWadyAlfrataea|title=The civilization of the Euphrates Valley|last=Ayyash|first=Abdul Qader|publisher=Ahali for printing, publishing and distribution|year=1989|location=Syria – Damascus|pages=161}}</ref>

Deir ez-Zor was one of the first cities that saw large demonstrations at the start of the [[Syrian civil war]]. The demonstrations began in the city on 15 March 2011, which was the first day in the movement of protests demanding the overthrow of the Syrian government. On 15 April 2011, a large demonstration was launched from the city's stadium despite the using of live bullets by the [[Syrian Public Security Police|security forces]] and the militias supporting it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/166417FB-172E-45B0-B769-06096A34DB4A.htm|title=Demonstration in Damascus demanding freedom|date=15 March 2011|website=Aljazeera.net}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/arabic/middleeast/2011/04/110415_syria_firday_demo.shtml|title=Syria, security uses batons and gas to prevent a mass demonstration from reaching the center of Damascus|date=15 April 2011|website=BBC Arabic}}</ref>

In the demonstrations on Friday, 22 April 2011 (the sixth Friday in the history of the [[Syrian Civil War|Syrian revolution]]), the statue of [[Bassel al-Assad|Basil al-Assad]] was shot down, until then, the Syrian government had been cautious about the protests in Deir ez-Zor, because of their clan nature and the size of their area and the presence of quantities of weapons in it stored from the days of the Iraq war. When the demonstrators headed towards the statue of Basil al-Assad, the [[Syrian Public Security Police|riot police]] fired only in the air. It is said that the demonstrators were not shot and prevented from dropping the statue because the security commanders did not know or appreciate the reaction that the people of the city could issue if one of the demonstrators were killed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/ar/20110715-syria-friday-of-freedom-prisoners-demonstrations|title=Demonstrations of "Freedom Prisoners Friday" start in several Syrian cities|date=15 July 2011|website=France 24 Channel}}</ref>

Syrian security forces took complete control of the city in August 2011, but the [[Free Syrian Army]] (associated with the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces) returned to take control in June 2012.

From 10 April 2016 to 31 August 2017, the World Food Programme supplied the city with food and essential relief items through a high-altitude airdrop service.
