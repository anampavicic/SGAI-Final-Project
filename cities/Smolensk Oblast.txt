As of the [[2021 Russian census|2021 Census]], its population was&nbsp;888,421.<ref name="2021Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2021Census}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Деревня Борешино под Смоленском.JPG|thumb|Roslavlsky old tract, the village of [[Boreshino]]]]

The oblast was founded on 27 September 1937.<ref name="ATS1981">Исполнительный комитет Смоленского областного совета народных депутатов. Государственный архив Смоленской области. "Административно-территориальное устройство Смоленской области. Справочник", изд. "Московский рабочий", Москва 1981. Стр.&nbsp;8</ref> It borders [[Pskov Oblast]] in the north, [[Tver Oblast]] in the northeast, [[Moscow Oblast]] in the east, [[Kaluga Oblast]] in south, [[Bryansk Oblast]] in the southwest, and [[Mogilev Region|Mogilev]] and [[Vitebsk Region|Vitebsk Oblasts]] of [[Belarus]], in the west and northwest, as part of the [[Belarus–Russia border]].

===Hydrography===
The main river of the region is the [[Dnieper River]] and its tributaries, [[Desna River|Desna]], Vop, [[Vyazma]]. By the rivers of the Volga basin and its tributary Vazuza Gzhat and tributary of the [[Oka river]], [[Ugra River (Oka)|Ugra]]. To the north-west flows a short section of the [[Western Dvina River]] and its tributary river Kasplya .

Among the major reservoirs supplying water are Moscow Vazuzssky Yauza and reservoirs in the north-east, as well as cooling power plants, [[Smolensk reservoir]] in the north near the village of Lake and [[Desnogorsk Reservoir]] in the south area of the city near the Desnogorsk.

===Climate===
The climate of Smolensk Oblast is humid continental, similar to the climate of [[Moscow Oblast]], but slightly warmer in winter due to being located further west. Summers are short, warm and rainy, while winters are long, cold and snowy. Average temperatures range from {{convert|-9|C}} in January to {{convert|17|C}} in July (although in the south it ranges from {{convert|-8|C}} in January to {{convert|18|C}} in July). Annual precipitation varies from {{convert|630|to|730|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year.

==Politics==
[[File:Budynek przy głównym placu w Smoleńsku - kwiecień 2013.jpg|thumb|Building of the Oblast Administration]]

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Smolensk CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of Smolensk Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Smolensk is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].
From July 1941-September 1943 part of region fell to Germany.

==Administrative divisions==
