'''Lucena''' ({{IPA-tl|lʊˈsɛna|IPA}} {{Respell|loo|SEH|nɘ}}), officially the '''City of Lucena''' ({{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Lucena}}), is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] in the [[Calabarzon]] region of the [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 278,924 people.{{PH census|current}}

It is the largest city and capital of [[Quezon|Quezon Province]] wherein it is geographically situated and grouped under the province by the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]], but in terms of government and administration, the city is politically independent from that province. It is one of the proposed metropolitan area in the Philippines. Metro Lucena is proposed to included the highly urbanized city of Lucena, as well as the towns of [[Candelaria, Quezon|Candelaria]], [[Dolores, Quezon|Dolores]], [[Lucban, Quezon|Lucban]], [[Pagbilao]], [[Sampaloc, Quezon|Sampaloc]], [[San Antonio, Quezon|San Antonio]], [[Sariaya]], [[Tayabas, Quezon|Tayabas]] and [[Tiaong, Quezon|Tiaong]].

==History==
===Early history===
In the 1570s, Captain [[Juan de Salcedo]] first explored what was then Kalilayan, later founded as a province in 1591. The [[Order of Friars Minor|Franciscan]] priests Juan de Plasencia and Diego de Oropesa between 1580 and 1583 founded its town, also named "'''Tayabas'''". Tayabas was organized by the Spaniards through the [[Franciscan]] missionaries and Lucena was just one of its barrios. Tayabas became the provincial capital in 1749, renaming the province after it.<ref name="QuezonGovPH-History">{{cite web|title=History of Quezon Province|url=http://www.quezon.gov.ph/homepage/?info=quezonhistory|website=Provincial Government of Quezon|access-date=April 4, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001223830/http://www.quezon.gov.ph/homepage/?info=quezonhistory|archive-date=October 1, 2016}}</ref><ref name="BalitaPH">{{cite news|last1=Ramos|first1=Lily O.|title=Quezon province's impressive historical and cultural heritage|url=http://balita.ph/2012/07/18/quezon-provinces-impressive-historical-and-cultural-heritage/|access-date=April 4, 2016|work=Balita.ph|date=July 18, 2012}}</ref>

The Spaniards of the 16th century called the area "'''Buenavista'''" because of its scenic beauty; several years later, the barrio was renamed "'''Oroquieta'''". A century later, Muslim pirates began terrorizing the entire Philippine coastline, including Oroquieta. The barrio folks built forts along the seashores to defend it against the attacking pirates along the coast, particularly in the present-day Cotta and in Barangay Mayao, though these structures are no longer extant. Hence, the place became known as '''''Cotta''''', the Spanish form of the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] ''kuta'' ('fort'). The growth of local maritime trade facilitated in the Cotta port and the final defeat of Moro pirates plying the Luzon and Visayan waters, afforded the growth of Lucena as a town which eventually led to its being the provincial capital of Tayabas in 1901.

Finally on November 3, 1879, a royal decree was issued and the Orden Superior Civil officially adopted the name "'''Lucena'''" in honor of a Spanish friar by the name of Father Mariano Granja, who came from [[Lucena, Córdoba]] in [[Andalucia]], Spain. Fr. Granja was responsible for the development of the barrio that became a [[Lucena Cathedral|Parish]] in 1881. Lucena became an independent municipality on June 1, 1882.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About Lucena City – Lucena City |url=https://www.lucenacity.gov.ph/about-lucena-city/ |access-date=November 1, 2023 |language=en-US}}</ref>

During the 1896 [[Philippine Revolution]], the people of Lucena showed their brand of patriotism. José Zaballero led the local revolutionists who were under the barrage of Spanish muskets. Later, Miguel Arguilles with Jose Barcelona as president formed a revolutionary government in Lucena.

After [[Emilio Aguinaldo|Aguinaldo]] [[Philippine Declaration of Independence|proclaimed the nation's independence]] on June 12, 1898, Gen. [[Miguel Malvar]], as Commanding General for Southern Luzon, took over Tayabas province on August 15, 1898. Don Crisanto Marquez became Lucena's first elected Municipal president during the first Philippine Republic.

===Filipino-American War===
[[File:Philippine Island - Luzon Island - NARA - 68156873.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Lucena, {{circa|1930s—40s}}]]

Lucena was involved in the [[Philippine–American War]] in 1899. The Americans established a civil government in the country, and on March 12, 1901, the provincial capital was transferred from [[Tayabas]] to Lucena.

=== World War II ===
On December 27, 1941, the [[Imperial Japanese Armed Forces|Japanese Imperial Forces]] overran the city of Lucena (referred to by the locals as ''The Fall of Lucena''), just 19 days after they set foot on Philippine soil. The Japanese wanted to strengthen their military presence in the region, sending units to capture key points in the town. The invasion was initially successful; however, the [[Imperial Japanese Armed Forces|Japanese Imperial Forces]] would soon encounter stiff resistance from members of the local resistance and members of the [[Hunters ROTC]].

The underground resistance movement was tenacious. Japanese Forces would be caught off-guard with surprise assaults which often resulted in fierce [[close-quarters combat]]. Constant assaults and logistical issues would take its toll on the Japanese forces.

By January 25, 1945, the Hunters ROTC guerrillas had penetrated into the town. Using their knowledge of the local surroundings to their advantage, they moved quickly in order prevent Japanese forces from organizing a proper defense. After a hard-fought offensive, the Filipino forces had successfully driven the Japanese out of Lucena. The people of Lucena would fortify their defenses in preparation for another assault. Attempts by the Japanese to re-establish their occupation of Lucena failed.

[[Quezon|Tayabas Province]] stood by and waited for the [[United States Armed Forces|American Liberation forces]] and the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippine Commonwealth]] troops, who would soon hand them their freedom on April 4, 1945.

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
Lucena was made into a chartered city through the efforts of then-Congressman Manuel S. Enverga of [[Quezon's 1st congressional district|Quezon's 1st district]]. Republic Act No. 3271 lapsed into law on June 17, 1961, without the signature of then-President [[Carlos P. Garcia]].The induction of its city officials led by then-Mayor Castro Profugo, as well as its formal inauguration took place on August 20, 1961, as formally stated on Section 90 of Republic Act No. 3271.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=RA|number=3271|date=June 17, 1961|url=https://lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1961/ra_3271_1961.html|title=An Act Creating the City of Lucena|publisher=The Lawphil Project|accessdate=August 2, 2024}}</ref>  On July 1, 1991, Lucena became a highly urbanized city, thereby making the city independent from the province.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1961/08/28/official-week-in-review-august-20-august-26-1961/|title=Official Week in Review: August 20 – August 26, 1961 &#124; GOVPH|website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines}}</ref>

In May 2014, the Lucena City Public Market was razed by fire while festivities were being held for the culmination of Pasayahan sa Lucena a few blocks away. The whole block of the public market building was burned down. Through the cooperation of firefighters from Sariaya, Tayabas, Pagbilao and Lucena.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/606376/fire-destroys-lucena-market|title=Fire destroys Lucena market|last=Mallari|first=Delfin T.

The 2-storey building, which reportedly cost 99 million pesos to build, was financed through loans. According to the article, the Lucena Public Market was also burned down in 1965 along with huge parts of the city.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/827706/new-lucena-city-market-rises-from-the-ashes|title=New Lucena City market rises from the ashes|last=Mallari|first=Delfin T.

In October 2019, the [[Department of Public Works and Highways]] (DPWH) completed the construction of a P245-million underpass along the [[Pan-Philippine Highway]] or the Manila South Road (MSR) Diversion Road in Brgy. Gulang-gulang, Lucena City, Quezon. The project was initially funded in the 2017 national budget at around ₱100 million. The remaining half was funded through the 2018 national budget. According to DPWH Secretary [[Mark Villar]], the 472-meter long underpass with a 16 lineal-meter concrete bridge at the Lucena-Tayabas-Mauban Port Road aims to reduce the traffic congestion around the Daang Maharlika Route. This new underpass would directly shorten the travel time of those traversing Quezon Province such as those coming from Manila going to the Bicol region and vice versa.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Tuquero |first1=Loreben |title=DPWH opens P245-million underpass in Lucena |url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/243216-underpass-opens-in-lucena |access-date=February 26, 2020 |work=Rappler}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=₱245-M Lucena underpass opens |url=https://cnnphilippines.com/regional/2019/10/23/Lucena-underpass-opens.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191024011331/https://cnnphilippines.com/regional/2019/10/23/Lucena-underpass-opens.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 24, 2019 |access-date=February 26, 2020 |work=CNN Philippines}}</ref> -->

==Geography==
[[File:LucenaCityRiverjf7895 03.JPG|thumb|left|Iyam River in Cotta]]
[[File:Lucena_from_air_(Quezon;_11-24-2021).jpg|thumb|right|Lucena from air]]
Lucena is situated {{convert|130|km|sp=us}} south of [[Manila]]. The city proper is wedged between two rivers, Dumacaa River on the east and Iyam River on the west. Seven other rivers and six creeks serve as natural drainage for the city. Its port on the coast along [[Tayabas Bay]] is home to several boat and ferry lines operating and serving the sea lanes between Lucena and the different points in the region and as far as the [[Visayas]].

Being the provincial capital and former Government Center of the former [[Southern Tagalog Region]], Lucena is host to most of the branches of governmental agencies, businesses, banks and service facilities in the [[Southern Tagalog]] region.

===Retail and commerce===
[[File:Lucena downtown, Merchan (Lucena, Quezon; 10-09-2022).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Downtown Merchan Street in Poblacion (Bayan)]]

Economic activities in Lucena are heavily concentrated in the ''poblacion'' and other suburban barangays where the highly dense and constricted [[central business district]] (CBD) is home to a large cluster of different business enterprises. As population grows in tandem with new and promising business prospects, business activities spill over adjoining barangays, thus forming mini satellite commercial areas.

Other commercial strips are located in the ''[[poblacion]]'' and suburban barangays where both retail and wholesale trade, including other essential services, are being engaged in. Lucena City features [[SM City Lucena]], the biggest mall in the city located in Ibabang Dupay, which is also one of the first [[SM Prime|SM Malls]] in [[Luzon]]. Other Shopping Centers include Pacific Mall Lucena (''Metro Gaisano Mall''), SM Savemore Agora, and Puregold Gulang-Gulang Lucena.

===Industries===
Big factories and warehouses are present in these suburban barangays like [[San Miguel Brewery]], [[Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc.]], [[PepsiCo Inc.|PepsiCo Philippines, Inc.]], [[Asia Brewery, Inc.]] [[Nestlé|Nestlé Philippines]], and [[Ginebra San Miguel|Ginebra San Miguel, Inc.]] (formerly La Tondeña Distillers Inc.), do business in sales, distribution, and transport of assorted business products in bulk.

Of the total {{convert|8,316.90|ha|abbr=on}} land area of Lucena City, {{percent|1651.77|8316.90|2}} or {{convert|1,651.77|ha}} cover the existing built-up area. Almost {{percent|46.62|8316.90|2}} of this or {{convert|46.62|ha}} cover the industrial section, located in different barangays of the city. These areas are home to significant industrial and manufacturing activities.

Industry in Lucena produces a sustainable amount of agro-industrial-based products, [[Dried fish|dried]] and [[smoked fish]], [[Liquor|distilled liquors]], [[Bamboo textile|bamboo]] and [[Rattan|rattan furniture]], [[Ornamental plant|ornamental flowers/plants]], vegetable as well as meat products.

Lucena is also known as the "Cocopalm City of the South". Nestled midst a wide expanse of coconut lands, Lucena has [[coconut oil]] mills which produce oil-based household products like [[cooking oil]], [[soap]], [[lard]], [[margarine]], and oil-based medicines. Exora Cooking Oil and Vegetable Lard and Miyami Cooking Oil are proudly made in this city. Tantuco Industries, JnJ Oil Industries, Inc., and Monaco Oil Company are some of the well-known coconut oil companies in the city.

Car assembly and manufacturing plants have also established in the city, while [[Manila]]-based car shops are starting to put up some branches like [[Toyota|Toyota-Lucena]], [[Isuzu Philippines|Isuzu-Lucena]], [[Mitsubishi Motors Philippines|SFM-Lucena]], and [[Foton Motor]].

San Pedro Shipping Yard, a subsidiary of MSLI, is also located in Dalahican.

===Festivals and celebrations===
The city features various celebrations, and one of the most prominent is the festival of Pasayahan in Lucena.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fiestas in Lucena City {{!}} Lucenahin {{!}} Lucena City Community Website|url=https://www.lucenahin.com.ph/fiestas-in-lucena-city/|access-date=January 24, 2024|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Tourism – Lucena City|url=https://www.lucenacity.gov.ph/our-tourism/|access-date=January 28, 2024|language=en-US}}</ref>[[File:Pasayahan sa Lucena.jpg|thumb|300x300px|   '''Pasayahan sa Lucena Grand Parade'''[[File:Pasayahan sa Lucena.ogg|thumb|center|280x280px|A 28-second sample of the festival song of Pasayahan sa Lucena. ]]]]
'''Pasayahan sa Lucena''' is a secular festival conceptualized to showcase the natural and ecological interrelationship and independence between nature and man. This local festival is managed and hosted by the [[Local government in the Philippines|local government unit]] of Lucena.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pasayahan sa Lucena – Lucena City |url=https://www.lucenacity.gov.ph/tourism/pasayahan-sa-lucena/ |access-date=June 26, 2024 |language=en-US}}</ref> It also promotes the ways of life inherent among the people of Lucena. Entertainment, cuisine, social drinking, dancing, live music, arts, and other leisure activities are traditionally included in the Pasayahan Festival.  

The Grand Parade of Pasayahan, also known as ''Mardi Gras'' among the city’s more senior residents, is the main highlight of the Pasayahan. It features a parade of enormous and vibrant floats made by the participating businesses and groups, as well as street dancing, marching bands, a Pandong (hat) competition, and a gay-friendly Carnival Queen competition.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Layug |first=Benjamin |date=June 27, 2019 |title=The Mardi Gras of the Philippines {{!}} Benjamin Layug |url=https://businessmirror.com.ph/2019/06/27/the-mardi-gras-of-the-philippines/ |access-date=June 26, 2024 |website=BusinessMirror |language=en-US}}</ref> 

The first Pasayahan in 1987 was a big triumph that it has become an annual affair. Year after year, the Pasayahan draws a sea of frolicking humanity. Pasayahan features the Chami Festival to promote Lucena’s very own native delicacies, the ''chami'' and ''tinapa''. Other features, such as the ''Binibining Pasayahan'', a street fashion show, a talent competition for LGBTQ youth, and other street concerts, take the stage in Pasayahan. Originally intended as three days of spirited merrymaking in the streets, the event has become a weeklong to monthlong tourist attraction.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pasayahan Sa Lucena 2013 {{!}} Lucenahin {{!}} Lucena City Community Website|url=https://www.lucenahin.com.ph/pasayahan-sa-lucena-2013/|access-date=January 24, 2024|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Pasayahan sa Lucena – Lucena City |url=https://www.lucenacity.gov.ph/tourism/pasayahan-sa-lucena/ |access-date=January 24, 2024 |language=en-US}}</ref>
