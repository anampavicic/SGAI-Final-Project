'''Buea''' is the capital of the [[Southwest Region (Cameroon)|Southwest Region]] of [[Cameroon]]. The city is located in [[Fako (department)|Fako Division]], on the eastern slopes of [[Mount Cameroon]], and has a population of about 800.000 inhabitants as of 2023.<ref name="worldgazetteer" /> It has two Government Hotels, the Mountain Hotel and Parliamentarian Flats Hotel located around The Government Residential Area.

==History==
[[Image:Schloss von Puttkamer.jpg|thumb|left|The Residence of [[Jesko von Puttkamer|von Puttkamer]] in Buea]]

Buea, originally "bue", was founded by a hunter who came from the Bomboko area. Coming from the Bomboko side of the mountain, he named the new-found land in amazement as "a Bue", meaning literally a "son of bué". A prominent King of the [[tikar]] clashes with German troops during invasion.
Resistance remain popular folklore; currently ruled by the Endeleys. [[Tea]] growing is an important local industry, especially in Tole. Buea was the [[Colonialism|colonial]] [[Capital (political)|capital]] of [[Germany|German]] [[Kamerun]] from 1901 to 1919, the capital of the [[Southern Cameroons]] from 1949 until 1961 and the capital of [[West Cameroon]] until 1972, when [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]] abolished the Federation of [[Cameroon]]. The German colonial administration in Buea was temporarily suspended during the eruption of Mount Cameroon from 28 April until June 1909. Originally, Buea's population consisted mainly of the [[Bakweri]] people. However, owing to its status as a university town and the regional capital, there are significant numbers of other ethnic groups.

===Ambazonian secession===
In September 2017, the [[Ambazonia|Federal Republic of Ambazonia]] declared its independence from Cameroon, with Buea as its claimed capital.<ref name="ADF Lands">[http://cameroonjournal.com/2017/09/10/breaking-news-adc-lands-ground-troops-in-southern-cameroons-declares-war-on-lrc/ ADC Lands Ground Troops in Southern Cameroons, Declares War on LRC]{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Cameroon Journal, 10 September 2017. Accessed 19 April 2018.</ref> In late-June 2018, the [[Ambazonia Defence Forces]] began approaching Buea, and on 29 June they invaded the Mile 16 neighborhood.<ref>[https://www.journalducameroun.com/en/panic-grips-buea-soldiers-battle-separatists/ Panic grips Buea as soldiers battle separatists], Journal du Cameroun, 29 June 2018. Accessed 29 June 2018.</ref> On 1 July, separatists invaded the Muea neighborhood and battled Cameroonian troops.<ref>[https://www.journalducameroun.com/en/muea-lockdown-soldiers-battle-separatists/ Muea in lockdown as soldiers battle separatists], Journal du Cameroun, 1 July 2018. Accessed 2 July 2018.</ref>

==Notable institutions==
Buea hosts the [[University of Buea]], Cameroon's first [[English language|anglophone]] university. It is the site of several other higher institutes of learning, including St Francis Schools of Nursing and Midwifery presently known as Biaka University Institute of Buea (BUIB) and one of Cameroon's three Catholic universities.

[[File:UB Junction.jpg|thumb|UB Junction]]

A handful of colonial era buildings are surviving, notably the palatial former residence of the German governor [[Jesko von Puttkamer]]. Other German colonial buildings are still standing, but some of them suffer from lack of maintenance and old age.

The Nigerian Consulate in anglophone Cameroon and the main operational hub of the [[Naigahelp]] medical aid organisation are in Buea.

Buea hosts an annex of the [[National Archives of Cameroon]], whose main location is [[Yaoundé]]. Next door to the annex is the [[Cameroon Press Photo Archive]], which has been permanently closed since 2001.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nsah|first=Solomon Kekeisen|title=The Cameroon Press Photo Archive (CPPA) Buea in Crisis 1955-2016|journal=Vestiges: Traces of Record|volume=3|issue=1|pages=65–81|date=June 2017|issn=2058-1963|url=http://www.vestiges-journal.info/index.php/Vestiges/article/view/15|access-date=31 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831173701/http://vestiges-journal.info/index.php/Vestiges/article/view/15|archive-date=31 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Economy ==
The economy of Buea is heavily influenced by its status as a [[Technology Hub|technology hub]]. Many young people come to the town to study at the [[University of Buea]], and this has created a thriving environment for experimentation, innovation and risk-taking. As a result, the town has become a hotspot for startups, particularly in the technology sector.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Cameroon's high-tech hub |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/business-36054263 |access-date=2023-06-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=CAMEROON |first=ORANGE |title=Silicon Mountain Conference 2022 – Orange Cameroun reinforces its promise to the tech innovation industry |url=https://www.businessincameroon.com/telecom/0211-12828-silicon-mountain-conference-2022-orange-cameroun-reinforces-its-promise-to-the-tech-innovation-industry |access-date=2023-06-02 |website=Business in Cameroon |language=en-gb}}</ref>

The University of Buea's influence has also attracted investors to the town, leading to the establishment of various tech incubators and hubs. For instance, LimbeLabs, which was founded around 2006–2008, was a precursor to ActivSpaces, one of the leading tech hubs in the country. ActivSpaces was launched in 2009 by Ebot Tabi, Bill Zimmerman, Valery Colong, Otto Akama, and Fua Tse. The hub currently has Rebecca Enonchong as Chairman.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Odunowo |first=Olanrewaju |date=2018-08-10 |title=Cameroon's Silicon Mountain: Its History, Resilience and Future |url=https://techcabal.com/2018/08/10/cameroons-silicon-mountain-its-history-resilience-and-future/ |access-date=2023-06-02 |website=TechCabal |language=en-US}}</ref>

Buea's status as a technology hub has also had a positive impact on the town's tourism industry. Mount Cameroon is a popular attraction for tourists, and the town's proximity to the mountain has made it a preferred destination for visitors who want to explore the mountain and its surroundings.

In addition, the town's small size makes it easy to meet and connect with people. It also has considerably light traffic congestion, which makes it easy to move around the town quickly. The proximity of Buea to Douala, which has the largest seaport and the international airport, has also made it an attractive location for businesses.

== Transport ==
Transportation to Buea is possible by land with the use of transport buses or private cars. Within Buea, the primary means of transportation are taxis. The closest airport is the [[Tiko Airport]], however due to its lack of activity and proper infrastructure management, the [[Douala International Airport]] (DLA), is the closest. 

Limbe was served by a {{RailGauge|600mm|lk=on}} gauge plantation railway to [[Limbe, Cameroon|Limbe]], of the [[History of rail transport in Cameroon#German colonial period|West African Planting Society Victoria]].<ref>http://www.gouverneur-ebermaier.de/english/narrow_gauge_railways.htm{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Geography==
About 300,000 people live in Buea (including the villages of Bokwaongo, Muea; Bomaka; Tole; [[Mile 16]] (Bolifamba); Mile 17; Mile 15; Mile 14 (Dibanda); Bova; Bonjongo; Likombe; Buasa; Great Soppo; Molyko; Small Soppo; Bwitingi; Mile 18 (Wonyamavio); Lower farms; Bokwai; [[Bonduma]]; Sandpit, Wonyamongo, Bulu; Bokova and surrounding villages).

===Climate===
[[Image:Tourists climbing Mount Cameroon.jpg|thumb|right|Tourists climbing [[Mount Fako]] in Buea]]
Buea has a [[Oceanic climate#Subtropical highland variety (Cfb, Cwb)|subtropical highland climate]] (Cfb) closely bordering on a [[tropical rainforest climate]] (Af). Because of its location at the foot of [[Mount Fako]], the climate in Buea tends to be [[humid]], with the neighbourhoods at higher elevations enjoying cooler temperatures while the lower neighbourhoods experience a hotter climate. Extended periods of rainfall, characterized by incessant [[drizzle]], which can last for weeks, are common during the rainy season as are damp [[fog]]s, rolling off the mountain into the town below.

Buea is made-up of a tropical monsoon climate with an average temperature of 80° high and 63° low, with the hottest month being February and the coldest August. It has an average monthly rainfall of 14.7 inches.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Buea Climate, Weather By Month, Average Temperature (Cameroon) - Weather Spark |url=https://weatherspark.com/y/61816/Average-Weather-in-Buea-Cameroon-Year-Round |access-date=2023-04-12 |website=weatherspark.com |language=en}}</ref>
