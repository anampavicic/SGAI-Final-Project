{{nihongo|'''Ōita Prefecture'''|大分県|Ōita-ken}} is a [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] of [[Japan]] located on the island of [[Kyūshū]].<ref>Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Ōita-ken" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 742|page=742}}.</ref> Ōita Prefecture has a population of 1,136,245 (1 June 2019) and has a geographic area of 6,340 [[Square kilometre|km<sup>2</sup>]] (2,448 [[sq mi]]). Ōita Prefecture borders [[Fukuoka Prefecture]] to the northwest, [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] to the southwest, and [[Miyazaki Prefecture]] to the south.

[[Ōita (city)|Ōita]] is the capital and largest city of Ōita Prefecture, with other major cities including [[Beppu]], [[Nakatsu, Ōita|Nakatsu]], and [[Saiki, Ōita|Saiki]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Ōita" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 742|page=742}}.</ref> Ōita Prefecture is located in the northeast of Kyūshū on the [[Bungo Channel]], connecting the [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[Seto Inland Sea]], across from [[Ehime Prefecture]] on the island of [[Shikoku]].

== History ==
{{See also|Historic Sites of Ōita Prefecture}}
Around the 6th century, [[Kyushu]] consisted of four regions: [[Tsukushi Province]], [[Hi Province]], [[Kumaso Province]] and [[Toyo Province]].

Toyo Province was later divided into two regions, upper and lower Toyo Province, called [[Bungo Province]] and [[Buzen Province]].

After the [[Meiji Restoration]], districts from [[Bungo Province|Bungo]] and [[Buzen Province|Buzen]] provinces were combined to form Ōita Prefecture.<ref>Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Provinces and prefectures" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 780|page=780}}.</ref> These provinces were divided among many local ''[[daimyō]]s'' and thus a large castle town never formed in Ōita. From this time that whole area became known as "Toyo-no-Kuni", which means "Land of Abundance".

The origins of the name Ōita are documented in a report from the early 8th century called the {{nihongo|Chronicles of Bungo|[[:ja:豊後国風土記|豊後国風土記]]|''bungonokuni-fudoki''}}.<ref name="oita20">Ōita Prefectural Government. (2006). ''Guide-O Ōita Prefecture Guide Book'', p. 20.</ref> According to the document, when Emperor Keikō visited the Kyushu region, stopping first in Toyo-no-Kuni, he exclaimed that 'This is a vast land, indeed. It shall be known as Okita-Kuni!' Okita-Kuni, meaning "Land of the Great Fields", later came to be written as "Ōita". Present day interpretations based on Ōita's topography state that Oita's name comes from "Okita", meaning "many fields", rather than "vast" or "great" field, because of Ōita's complex terrain.<ref name="oita20"/>

In the [[Edo period]] (1603–1867) the town of [[Hita]] was the government seat for the entire domain of [[Kyushu]], which was directly controlled by the national government or ''[[shōgun]]'' at that time. The region became well known for the money-lending industry based out of [[Hita]]. Merchants in Hita's Mameda and Kuma districts worked with the national government to create this money-lending industry known as Hita-kin.

===Shrines and temples===
''[[Sasamuta-jinja]]'' and ''[[Yusuhara Hachiman-gū]]'' are the chief [[Shinto shrine]]s (''[[ichinomiya]]'') in the prefecture.<ref>[http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/images/uploads/EOS070712Ab.pdf "Nationwide List of ''Ichinomiya''," p. 3]; retrieved February 9, 2012.</ref>

== Geography ==
Ōita Prefecture is on the north-eastern section of the island of [[Kyūshū]]. It is {{convert|119|km}} from east to west, and {{convert|106|km}} from north to south, with a total area of 6,340.71 square kilometers.

Surrounded by the [[Suo Channel]] and [[Honshū]] Island to the north, the [[Iyo Channel]] and [[Shikoku]] Island to the east, it is bordered by [[Miyazaki Prefecture]] to the south, and [[Fukuoka Prefecture]] and [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] to the west. It is divided between north and south by a major tectonic line running from [[Usuki]] City in Ōita Prefecture to Yatsushiro City in [[Kumamoto]] Prefecture, which is to the west of Ōita. There are several other tectonic lines running from east to west through the prefecture. The northern part of the prefecture features [[granite]] and [[metamorphic rocks]], while the southern area features [[limestone]], which is the foundation for the [[Tsukumi]] cement industry, and several limestone caves. The Kirishima Range is a [[volcanic belt]] that runs vertically through the prefecture and contributes to the many hot spring sources that make the region a popular tourist attraction and makes Ōita the prefecture with the largest number of hot springs in the whole country.<ref>Ōita Prefectural Government. (2009). ''Reassurance, Vitality & Growth of Ōita Prefecture,'' p. 5.</ref>

The mountain ranges include the peaks of [[Mount Yufu]], [[Mount Tsurumi]], [[Mount Sobo]], [[Mount Katamuki]], and [[Mount Kujū]] (which is called the "roof of Kyushu"). These mountain ranges contribute to the fact that 70% of Oita is covered by forests, and the rivers and streams that flow from these ranges give the prefecture rich water sources. The prefecture's major water sources are the [[Yamakuni River]] (with the [[Heisei Ozeki Dam]] and [[Yabakei Dam]] on it), Yakkan River, Ōita River, [[Ōno River]] (with [[Hakusui Dam]] on it), and Banjō River. The coastline features include [[Beppu Bay]] and the [[Bungo Channel]]. 
[[File:Kuju_Mountains_and_Kuju_Plateau.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Kujū|Kujū Mountains]]]]
[[Mount Kujū]], a volcano, is surrounded by highlands called the Kujū Highlands and the Handa Highlands. The main agriculture activity on the plateau grasslands north and south of Mt. Kujū is [[dairy farming]]. There are open plains throughout the prefecture with Nakatsu Plain in the north, Oita Plain in the center, and Saiki Plain in the south. The inland areas consist of basin valleys in [[Hita]], [[Kusu District, Ōita|Kusu]], [[Yufuin]] and [[Taketa]], which were formed by [[lava]] buildup in combination with river [[erosion]]. 

Ōita has a {{convert|759|km|abbr=on}} coastline that has shoals in the north, Beppu Bay in the center, and a jagged or sawtooth "rias coastline" in the south. Sea cliffs, caves, and sedimentary rock formations that can be found in [[Saiki]] City's Yakata Island are considered very rare outside of coral reef areas. Ōita's coastal waters contribute to a prosperous fishing industry.

As of April 1, 2014, 28% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as [[List of national parks of Japan#History|Natural Parks]], namely the [[Aso Kujū National Park|Aso Kujū]] and [[Setonaikai National Park|Setonaikai]] National Parks; the [[Nippō Kaigan Quasi-National Park|Nippō Kaigan]], [[Sobo-Katamuki Quasi-National Park|Sobo-Katamuki]], and [[Yaba-Hita-Hikosan Quasi-National Park|Yaba-Hita-Hikosan]] Quasi-National Parks; and the [[Bungo Suidō Prefectural Natural Park|Bungo Suidō]], [[Jinkakuji Serikawa Prefectural Natural Park|Jinkakuji Serikawa]], [[Kunisaki Hantō Prefectural Natural Park|Kunisaki Hantō]], [[Sobo Katamuki Prefectural Natural Park (Ōita)|Sobo Katamuki]], and [[Tsue Sankei Prefectural Natural Park|Tsue Sankei]] Prefectural Natural Parks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/nps/park/doc/files/np_6.pdf |title=General overview of area figures for Natural Parks by prefecture |publisher=[[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] |date=April 1, 2014 |access-date=February 8, 2015}}</ref>

===Current municipalities===
{{See also|List of cities in Ōita Prefecture by population}}
[[Image:Oita takasago.jpg|thumb|right|Oita City]]
[[Image:Kizan park Distant view.jpg|thumb|right|Hita]]
[[File:View of Beppu 20170218.jpg|thumb|right|Beppu]]
[[Image:Panorama view of Yufuin.jpg|thumb|right|Yufu]]
[[Image:Lookout from Saiki castle ruins.jpg|thumb|right|Saiki]]

Currently, the prefecture has 14 cities, 3 districts, 3 towns, and one village. From 2005 to 2006, all municipalities but [[Beppu]], [[Tsukumi]], [[Himeshima]], [[Hiji]], and all towns in [[Kusu District, Ōita|Kusu]] District, were merged, and the total municipalities went down from 58 on December 31, 2004, to 18 after the creation of the city of [[Kunisaki]] by merging with 4 towns from Higashikunisaki District on March 31, 2006. As a result, the prefecture became the one with the fewest municipalities within Kyūshū, and the fourth fewest in Japan. However, Ōita Prefecture now has the fewest towns (3) and fewest towns and villages combined (4) in all of Japan.

== Economy ==

Ōita Prefecture's industrial activity is centered on agricultural products. Fishery products and manufactured goods rank second and third respectively in terms of Ōita's industrial activity.

Ōita is Japan's number one producer of the following products:<ref>Ōita Prefectural Government, ''Guide-O Oita Prefecture Guide Book,'' p. 40-41.</ref>

'''Kabosu limes:''' Ōita Prefecture is Japan's number one producer of [[kabosu]], a citrus fruit that is similar to a lime. Kabosu are available year-round but peak season for taste and quality is from August to October. [[Kabosu]] are rich in vitamin C and contain beneficial acids, such as citric acid. Kabosu have been produced in the [[Taketa]] and [[Usuki]] areas for many years.

'''Dried shiitake mushrooms:''' Ōita is the largest producer of dried [[shiitake]] mushrooms in Japan, and the cultivation of [[shiitake]] mushrooms is said to have originated in Ōita. Ōita's dried shiitake rank number one in Japan in production quantity and quality. [[Shiitake]] are said to be beneficial in the prevention of high blood pressure and [[arterial sclerosis]].

'''Saffron:''' [[Saffron]] has been cultivated in Ōita since the late 19th century, and Ōita's [[Taketa]] area produces 80% of Japan's total amount of [[saffron]], making Ōita the top producer of [[saffron]]. The quality of Ōita [[saffron]] has gained international acclaim as active component levels are several times higher than foreign saffron. [[Saffron]] is said to have many benefits including circulation enhancement and is used as a food coloring and natural medicine.

'''Galingale:''' Ōita is Japan's top producer of {{nihongo|galingale|[[:ja:シチトウ|シチトウ]]｜shichitō}}, a kind of rush plant, a grass with a distinctive triangular profile, belonging to the family [[Cyperaceae]]. It is grown in [[Kunisaki Peninsula]] of Ōita Prefecture and is used in the production of Ryukyu-style [[tatami]] mats, as it is dust and moisture absorbent and has a pleasant scent.

'''Madake bamboo:''' The madake variety of bamboo makes up 60% of Japan's cultivated bamboo, and Ōita is Japan's top producer. It is the most popular variety of bamboo used in handiwork and traditional crafts since it is very flexible and pressure resistant.

Ōita ranks number one in Japan (and second in the world next to America's Yellowstone National Park) for the amount of hot-spring output and geothermal power. Ōita also ranks number one in Japan for the amount of limestone production.

===Other industries===

Seki-aji and seki-saba are mackerels that are well-known seafood products of Ōita. Ōita has gained nationwide recognition for their promotion of "The Oita Brand", labeling local products with the prefectural name.

Key Ōita Brand products are as follows:<ref>Ōita Prefectural Government, ''Reassurance, Vitality & Growth,'' p. 34.</ref>

'''Agricultural products:''' tomatoes, [[leek]]s, [[Strawberry|strawberries]], [[scallion]]s, [[kabosu]] limes, greenhouse [[tangerine]]s, {{nihongo|prairie gentians|トルコギキョウ|torukogikyō}}, [[rose]]s, [[chrysanthemum]]s, pears ([[Hita]] City, Shonai Town in [[Yufu]] City and [[Kokonoe, Ōita|Kokonoe]] town in Kusu are all production regions for Japanese pears. Oita pears are shipped nationwide, with large distribution quantities throughout Kyushu), and Bungo beef (the Kujū highlands are a perfect feeding ground for cattle and cattle farmers in Oita are involved in breeding and shipping cattle. Bungo beef is a well known local product.).

'''Forest products:''' Dried [[shiitake]] mushrooms and Oita-style seasoned timber (Oita is one of the leading production centers for Japanese [[Cryptomeria|cedar]], ranking second in Japan for amount of lumber reserves and number of cedars produced. Oita cedar producers use a special method for drying the wood which combines benefits of natural and artificial drying to produce cedar that has cracks and retains its natural scent and color.)

== Culture ==
Oita is in the northeast corner of the island of Kyushu. Its coastal areas, farmland, highland, and mountains lend to a mix of different farming and fishing culture. There are many festivals throughout the year to pray for healthy harvests and abundant crops.

As of May 2006, 146 cultural assets in Ōita were designated by the national government (Agency for Cultural Affairs), four of which are designated as [[National Treasures of Japan|National Treasures]]. Additionally, the prefecture itself has designated almost 700 traditions, properties, landmarks etc. as cultural assets.

===National treasures===
# [[Fuki-ji]] Temple: The only wooden structure in Kyushu to remain intact since the [[Heian period]] (794–1192). Fukiji Temple is in [[Bungotakada, Ōita|Bungotakada.]][[File:富貴寺_大堂.JPG|thumb|[[Fuki-ji|Fuki-ji's]] Main Hall]]
# The Main Building of [[Usa Shrine]]: A building which is said to be a prototype for ''[[Hachiman shrine|hachiman]]'' style architecture located in [[Usa, Ōita|Usa City]].
# Peacock Buddhist Altar Fitting: This is a Buddhist altar fitting called ''Kujaku Monkei'' with engraved peacocks and an inscription dated 1209. The information on it tells of the relationship between Usa Shrine and the former Mirokuji, a [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temple]] once connected to the shrine as a [[jingū-ji]].
# [[Usuki Stone Buddhas]]: Approximately 60 cliff carvings of Buddha that were crafted between the Heian period (794–1192) and the [[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333) are the only rock carvings of their kind to have received a "[[National Treasure (Japan)|National Treasure]]" designation. They are in [[Usuki, Ōita|Usuki City]]. [[File:Usuki_Stone_Buddhas.jpg|thumb|One of the [[Usuki Stone Buddhas]]]]

Below are some of Oita's cultural traditions that are designated by the Agency for Cultural Affairs as [[Intangible Cultural Property (Japan)|Important Intangible Cultural Properties]]:

# Shujo Onie Fire Festival: An event held to pray for national security, health, and longevity on the first day of the Chinese New Year at temples of Tendai Buddhist denomination in the Kunisaki Peninsula area. The three temples that continue to hold this event are the Tennenji-temple (Bungotakata City), Iwatoji-temple (Kunisaki Town) and Jobutsuji-temple (Kunisaki Town).
# Koyo Shrine Puppet Show: This is a puppet show also known as "Kitabaru Puppet Show" which uses ''kugutsu'' puppets that perform dance and sumo wrestling matches. Oita's Hachiman Kohyo Shrine is in Nakatsu City.
# Hita's Gion Festival: A festival held in Hita City in July with parade floats that are up to 12 meters high. Although the festival only takes place once a year, the magnificent floats are on display year-round at the Gion Festival Float Museum in Kuma Town, Hita City.
# Yoshihiro Gaku Traditional Performing Art: Dance performed along with traditional song and music in Musashi Town in Kunisaki Peninsula
# Manufacturing Process of Sulfur "Flowers" at Myoban Hot Spring: Thatched huts at Myoban Hot Spring are used to produce ''yu-no-hana'' or sulfur “flowers” which are crystals that develop naturally on the ground around the springs. The manufacturing and collection process of the sulfur flowers has remained largely unchanged since the Edo period and thus the manufacturing process itself is designated as an ethno-cultural asset. The crystals are used as the main component of bath salts sold in Myoban, which are a popular souvenir that is used to help heal skin conditions.

===Dance===
'''[[Kagura]]''' is a sacred dance performed at festivals and celebrations throughout the prefecture.

'''Shonai kagura''' is a festive dance that has been practiced for over 200 years and is representative of Oita Prefecture. Another kagura, the '''Ondake-style Kagura''', was nationally designated as an "Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property" in 2007. There is also traditional song and music known as "''gaku''" that is performed in the Kunisaki Peninsula Area and is accompanied by characteristic dances such as the ''Yoshihirogaku'' in Musashi Town. Dancers wear grass skirts and dance with a drum tied to their front and a flag tied to their backs to pray to the Buddhist God Amida Buddha. In the Ono district there are 80 groups of ''Shishimai'' or dancers who perform a lion dance with roots based on the Ondake-style dance.

===Crafts===
'''[[Onta ware|Onta Pottery]]''' is the name of a type of stoneware pottery made for everyday usage – typically called 'mingei' (folk art or craft) in Japanese. The community is situated in the Hiko mountain range, about 17 kilometres from the centre of Hita City, and is said to have been established in 1705 to make large wares – lidded jars for pickled vegetables and fruit, water crocks, ash burners, and pouring vessels with small spouts – for local farmhouses. At the time potters were themselves farmers, who produced pots during the 'off season' in agriculture. These they fired in a cooperative kiln (kyōdō noborigama). 
[[File:Sake_Bottle_(tokkuri)_LACMA_M.2008.264.24.jpg|thumb|[[Onta ware]] ''[[tokkuri]]'']]
Onta pottery is now produced full-time by ten families in Sarayama, five of whom continue to share and fire an eight chambered climbing kiln. The other five households fire independent climbing kilns of four or five chambers, which they fire approximately six times a year. The potters use clays that they dig locally and obtain natural materials (notably, wood ash, rice straw ash, feldspar, iron oxide and, occasionally, copper) with which to mix their glazes. Sarayama is famous for the 'karausu' clay pounders lining its two streams and powered by the water therein. The fact that the clay pounders prepare only enough clay for two people to work with full-time at the wheel has determined both household structure and the number of houses able to take up pottery in Sarayama.<ref>Moeran, Brian. Folk Art Potters of Japan. London: Curzon/Routledge, 1997.</ref>

For anything other than small pots, potters use a kick wheel on which to throw their wares, which they decorate typically with hakeme and tobiganna slipware decoration techniques. In April 1995, the Agency for Cultural Affairs announced the designation of Onta Pottery as an "Important Intangible Cultural Property" in 1995.<ref>Moeran, Brian. ''The Journal of Modern Craft'', Volume 1, Number 1, March 2008, pp. 35–54(20). Berg Publishers</ref> This designation is for the actual techniques used in making the pottery and not the actual pots themselves. Precisely because the designation is for the process rather than the product, it is regarded as an "intangible" property and is the only stoneware pottery-making process so designated in Japan.

'''Bamboo Crafts''' were started in the late 14th century to create baskets for travelling goods salesmen. During the [[Edo period]] (1600–1868) [[Beppu]] thrived as a tourist town and bamboo baskets and goods were used in the daily lives of the local people for everything from cooking to washing in order to meet the demands of the thriving tourist population. The bamboo items soon became a souvenir that tourists purchased to take home and this solidified making Beppu a center for Bamboo crafts production. In 1903 a training center for bamboo workers was established and present-day visitors to Beppu can enjoy learning about the history of bamboo, and hands-on classes at the Beppu City Traditional Bamboo Crafts Center. Festivals using bamboo shoots as candle holders are carried out yearly in the autumn in [[Usuki]], [[Taketa]], and [[Hita]] Cities.

===Religion===
The [[Kunisaki Peninsula]] has been called "Buddha's Village" and many [[Japanese sculpture|Buddhist statues]] and [[Buddhist temples in Japan|temples]] fill the areas surrounding [[Bungotakada, Ōita|Bungotakada]] and [[Kunisaki]]. The most notable of these are the ''[[Rokugō Manzan]]'' (六郷満山) temples. ''[[Shinbutsu-shūgō]]'' (神仏習合), or the syncretism of [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]] and [[Shinto]], is said to have begun in this region out of the unique ''Rokugō Manzan'' culture.<ref name="Shinbutsu Shugo">{{cite web |title=神仏習合発祥の地を巡る旅（国東市・豊後高田市） |url=https://www.visit-oita.jp/myplan/detail/188 |website=Visit Oita |access-date=13 June 2024}}</ref><ref name="Manzan">{{cite web |title=Rokugo Manzan Temples |url=https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4724.html |website=Japan Guide |access-date=13 June 2024}}</ref>

[[Usa Jingū]] in [[Usa, Ōita|Usa]] is the head shrine of [[Hachiman shrine|Hachiman Shrines]] in Japan. It is said to be the birthplace of [[mikoshi]].<ref name="mikoshi">{{cite web |title=宇佐神宮 |url=https://www.city.usa.oita.jp/tourist/touristspot/touristspot2/touristspot3/10171.html |website=Usa City Official Website |access-date=13 June 2024}}</ref>
[[File:Usa_Shrine_(Nanchūrōmon).jpg|thumb|[[Usa Jingū]]]]
Mankoji Temple which was founded in 1352 is a place for practicing [[zen]] [[meditation]].

===Architecture===
The [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] also designates certain areas for preservation as [[Groups of Traditional Buildings]]. The merchant quarter of [[Hita]], Mameda Town, is one of 83 districts (as of April 1, 2009) throughout the country designated as "Important Preservation Districts for Groups of Traditional Buildings".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/index.html|title=Agency for Cultural Affairs}}</ref> Old samurai residences throughout the prefecture are points of architectural interest. Nioza Historical Road in Usuki is also lined with buildings dating back to the 16th century and also in Usuki the Inaba-Family Villa is a former samurai residence open to the public.

[[Arata Isozaki]] is a world-renowned architect who is from Oita. The former Oita Prefectural Library (now Oita Art Plaza) won an award for architectural design in 1967. Other works of his can be found throughout the prefecture including B-con Plaza in Beppu, Bungo-No-Kuni Information Library, the Audio-Visual Center in Oita City, and Yufu Train Station.

===Music===
The [[Martha Argerich]] music festival "Argerich's Meeting Point in Beppu" is an annual event held in [[Beppu]] City. Martha Argerich is the General Director of the festival and the event is supported by a large number of volunteers. It takes place over 10 days and includes recitals and also lessons. This international event welcomes music lovers from all over the world to Beppu.

Another attraction is [[Takasakiyama Natural Zoological Garden|Mount Takasaki Monkey Park]], a park featuring two distinct troupes of wild [[Japanese macaque]] monkeys that make regular visits to the feeding grounds. The reserve was initially established to prevent the monkeys from raiding the region's fruit crops, a behavior that brought them into conflict with local farmers. The wild macaques can be observed up close in the park during the feeding sessions.

==Notable people==
* [[Ōtomo Sōrin]] (1530–1587): The Otomo family ruled over the [[Funai Domain]], which is present day [[Ōita, Ōita|Ōita City]], in the 16th century. Funai was a very internationalized city which engaged in trade and exchange with other nations. Sōrin, the 21st leader of the [[Ōtomo clan]], embraced Western culture enthusiastically and invited the missionary [[Francis Xavier]] to the city to promote Christianity. Sōrin dreamed of creating a Christian nation; he was baptized and given the name "Don Francisco". Sōrin died in [[Tsukumi]].<ref>Ōita Prefectural Government, ''Guide-O Ōita Prefecture Guide Book'', p. 28.</ref>
* [[Miura Baien]] (September 1, 1723 – April 9, 1789): A scholar originally known as Susumu but called Baien after the name of his private school where he educated many scholars. Miura developed his own system of logic and wrote many works including his three famous words, {{nihongo|Deep Words|玄語|''gengo''}}, {{nihongo|Redundant Words|贅語|''zeigo''}}, and {{nihongo|Bold Words|敢語|''kango''}}. He also worked in a hospital and had a good knowledge of [[astronomy]]. He hand made an astronomical globe that was passed down through many generations.<ref name="oita20"/> He spent his entire life in Tominaga Village which is the present day area of [[Aki District, Kōchi|Aki]] Town in [[Kunisaki]] City. Miura Baien is considered one of Ōita's three sages along with Hoashi Banri and Hirose Tansō.
* {{nihongo|[[Hoashi Banri]]|帆足万里||February 11, 1778 – July 30, 1852}}: Miura Baien's pupil who expanded his academic ability into many fields including [[Confucianism]], natural sciences, medicine and language. He taught himself Dutch to reference scientific publications for his eight-volume work ''Kyuritsu'', which was considered the top work of Western natural science in Japan at that time. In 1832 he was made Minister for the Feudal Lord to fix the financial problems of the Hiji clan.<ref name="oita20"/> Banri Hoashi is considered one of Ōita's three sages along with Miura Baien and Hirose Tansō.
* {{nihongo|Hirose Tansō|広瀬淡窓||May 22, 1782 – November 28, 1856}}: A Confucian scholar, poet and educator from a money-lending family in Hita. Ōita's current governor [[Katsusada Hirose]] is a descendant of Tansō Hirose. In Edo period Japan, education was limited to samurai families and the rich. However, Hirose Tansō opened a school called {{nihongo|Kangien|[[:ja:咸宜園|咸宜園]]}} meaning "all are welcome" and admitted students regardless of social status, age, or education level. The school's methodology of a "self-administered work-study policy" is said to have had great influence on the modern day education system in Japan. Former Prime Minister [[Kiyoura Keigo]] was educated here, with other students who went on to become influential scholars, artists and politicians. The school remains were designated a historical site in 1932 and are a couple blocks from the original Hirose family house, now the Hirose Museum. There, Tansō Hirose and other family members’ works are on display, with other original Hirose artifacts, China dolls, tea ceremony utensils and more. Both are in Mameda Town, about a 10-minute walk from [[Hita]] Station. Tansō Hirose is considered one of the Oita's three sages along with Miura Baien and Hoashi Banri. An asteroid called [[10009 Hirosetanso]] discovered by the [[University of Tokyo]] in 1977 was named after Tansō Hirose.
* [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]] (1834–1901): Founded Japan's oldest institute of higher education, [[Keio University]] in Tokyo. Fukuzawa Yukichi grew up in the [[Nakatsu]] domain and is pictured on the 10,000 yen bill. He was influential in Japan's education system by promoting independence and self-reliance of the Japanese people at his classes as [[Keio-Gijuku University]], known as present day Keio University, originally a school for Western studies. The university now educates in a range of fields and produces influential and prominent alumni.
* [[Hiroshi Nagahama]] (born 1970): Veteran [[anime]] industry luminary who began his career in 1990 with [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse Studio]] as an animator and went on to direct ''[[Mushishi]]'', ''[[Detroit Metal City]]'', ''[[The Flowers of Evil (manga)|The Flowers of Evil]]'' and ''[[The Reflection (TV series)|The Reflection]]'', as well as serving as art director of ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]''.
* [[Yamamoto Tatsuo (politician)|Yamamoto Tatsuo]], once governor of the [[Bank of Japan]] from 1898 to 1903, was from here.
