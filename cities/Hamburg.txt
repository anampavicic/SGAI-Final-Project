{{Main|History of Hamburg}}

{{For timeline}}

===Origins===
[[Claudius Ptolemy]] (2nd century AD) reported the first name for the vicinity as [[Treva]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/mapping-ancient-germania-berlin-researchers-crack-the-ptolemy-code-a-720513-2.html|title=Mapping Ancient Germania: Berlin Researchers Crack the Ptolemy Code|first=Matthias|last=Schulz|newspaper=Der Spiegel|date=1 October 2010|via=Spiegel Online}}</ref>

===Etymology===
The name Hamburg comes from the first permanent building on the site, a castle which the Emperor [[Charlemagne]] ordered constructed in AD 808. It rose on rocky terrain in a marsh between the [[Alster|River Alster]] and the [[Elbe|River Elbe]] as a defence against [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] incursion, and acquired the name ''Hammaburg'', ''burg'' meaning castle or fort. The origin of the ''Hamma'' term remains uncertain,<ref>{{Citation|ref=Verg |last1=Verg |first1=Erich |last2=Verg|first2=Martin|year=2007 |title=Das Abenteuer das Hamburg heißt |edition=4th |location=Hamburg |publisher=Ellert&Richter |isbn=978-3-8319-0137-1 |page=8|language=de}}

===Medieval Hamburg===
[[File:Hamburg in 1150.jpg|thumb|left|Hamburg in 1150]]
In 834 CE, Hamburg was designated as the seat of a [[Prince-Bishop|bishopric]]. The first bishop, [[Ansgar]], became known as the Apostle of the North. Two years later, Hamburg was united with [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Bremen]] as the [[List of administrators, archbishops, bishops, and prince-archbishops of Bremen|Bishopric of Hamburg-Bremen]].<ref name=verg15>[[#Verg|Verg (2007)]], p.15</ref>

Hamburg was destroyed and occupied several times. In 845, 600 [[Viking]] ships sailed up the [[Elbe|River Elbe]] and destroyed Hamburg, at that time a town of around 500 inhabitants.<ref name="verg15"/> In 1030, King [[Mieszko II Lambert]] of [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Poland]] burned down the city. [[Valdemar II of Denmark]] raided and occupied Hamburg in 1201 and in 1214. The [[Black Death]] killed at least 60% of the population in 1350.<ref>{{citation |last=Snell |first=Melissa |url=http://historymedren.about.com/od/theblackdeath/a/greatmortality_2.htm |title=The Great Mortality |publisher=Historymedren.about.com |access-date=19 April 2009 |year=2006 |archive-date=10 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310140601/http://historymedren.about.com/od/theblackdeath/a/greatmortality_2.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>
Hamburg experienced several great fires in the medieval period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wtcf.org.cn/MemberCities/Overview/Introduction/201407308185.html|title=Hamburg – Introduction – WTCF-Better City Life through Tourism|website=en.wtcf.org.cn|access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref>

In 1189, by imperial charter, [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I "Barbarossa"]] granted Hamburg the status of a [[Free Imperial City]] and tax-free access (or [[free-trade zone]]) up the Lower Elbe into the North Sea. In 1265, an allegedly forged letter was presented to or by the Rath of Hamburg.<ref name=verg26>[[#Verg|Verg (2007)]], p. 26</ref> This charter, along with Hamburg's proximity to the main trade routes of the [[North Sea]] and [[Baltic Sea]], quickly made it a major port in Northern Europe. Its trade alliance with [[Lübeck]] in 1241 marks the origin and core of the powerful Hanseatic League of trading cities. On 8 November 1266, a contract between [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] and Hamburg's traders allowed them to establish a ''hanse'' in London. This was the first time in history that the word ''hanse'' was used for the trading guild of the [[Hanseatic League]].<ref name=verg30>[[#Verg|Verg (2007)]], p. 30
</ref>
In 1270, the solicitor of the [[senate of Hamburg]], ''Jordan von [[Boitzenburger Land|Boitzenburg]]'', wrote the first description of civil, criminal and procedural law for a city in Germany in the German language, the ''Ordeelbook'' (''Ordeel'': sentence).<ref>

In 1356, the ''Matthiae-Mahl'' feast dinner for [[Hanseatic League]] cities was celebrated for the first time on 25 February, the first day of spring in medieval times. It continues today as the world's oldest ceremonial meal.<ref name="mattmahl">{{cite news |title=The Matthiae meal |url=https://www.euscreen.eu/item.html?id=EUS_0065DB52E4BF42279013651EE15AE220 |agency=EU Screen |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=2003 |access-date=12 February 2023 |archive-date=12 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230212180228/https://www.euscreen.eu/item.html?id=EUS_0065DB52E4BF42279013651EE15AE220 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Early modern period===
[[File:Hamburg um 1600 Brook.jpg|thumb|Hamburg, {{circa|1600}}]]
In 1529, the city embraced [[Lutheranism]], and it received [[Continental Reformed church|Reformed]] refugees from the [[Netherlands]] and France.

When [[Jan van Valckenborgh]] introduced a second layer to the fortifications to protect against the [[Thirty Years' War]] in the seventeenth century, he extended Hamburg and created a "New Town" (''Neustadt'') whose street names still date from the grid system of roads he introduced.<ref>[http://www.carltoepferstiftung.de/img/pdf/tourist_information_inner_pages.pdf History of the area] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206104950/http://www.carltoepferstiftung.de/img/pdf/tourist_information_inner_pages.pdf |date=6 February 2013 }}, accessed 3 November 2012</ref>

From the autumn of 1696 to the spring of 1697 the [[Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies|Company of Scotland trading to Africa and the Indies]] was active in Hamburg.  While it was unsuccessful in raising capital locally, it commissioned the construction of four vessels in the port.  The ''Caledonia'', a ship of 600 tons with 56 guns, and the ''Instuaration'' (later renamed the ''St. Andrew''), a vessel of 350 tons, were launched in March 1697.<ref>Watt, Douglas (2024), ''The Price of Scotland: Darien, Union and the Wealth of Nations'', Luath Press Limited, [[Edinburgh]], pp. 97 - 103 & 117 - 121, {{isbn|9781913025595}}</ref>

Upon the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806, the [[Free imperial city|Free Imperial City]] of Hamburg was not incorporated into a larger administrative area while retaining special privileges ([[German mediatisation|mediatised]]), but became a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] state with the official title of the ''Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg''. Hamburg was briefly annexed by [[Napoleon I]] to the [[First French Empire]] (1804–1814/1815). Russian forces under [[Levin August, Count von Bennigsen|General Bennigsen]] finally freed the city in 1814. Hamburg re-assumed its pre-1811 status as a city-state in 1814. The [[Congress of Vienna|Vienna Congress]] of 1815 confirmed Hamburg's independence and it became one of 39 sovereign states of the [[German Confederation]] (1815–1866).

In 1842, about a quarter of the inner city was destroyed in the "[[Great Fire of Hamburg|Great Fire]]". The fire started on the night of 4 May and was not extinguished until 8 May. It destroyed three churches, the town hall, and many other buildings, killing 51 people and leaving an estimated 20,000 homeless. Reconstruction took more than 40 years.
[[File:JMDavid Hamburg vom westlichen Wall 1811.jpg|thumb|Hamburg in 1811]]

After periodic political unrest, particularly in [[Revolutions of 1848|1848]], Hamburg adopted in 1860 a semidemocratic constitution that provided for the election of the Senate, the governing body of the city-state, by adult taxpaying males. Other innovations included the separation of powers, the separation of Church and State, freedom of the press, of assembly and association. Hamburg became a member of the [[North German Confederation]] (1866–1871) and of the [[German Empire]] (1871–1918), and maintained its self-ruling status during the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–1933). [[Accession of Hamburg to the German Customs Union (Zollverein)|Hamburg acceded to the German Customs Union or Zollverein]] in 1888, the last (along with Bremen) of the German states to join. The city experienced its fastest growth during the second half of the 19th century when its population more than quadrupled to 800,000 as the growth of the city's [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] trade helped make it Europe's second-largest port.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aapa.files.cms-plus.com/PDFs/WORLD%20PORT%20RANKINGS%202011.pdf|website=aapa-ports.org|department=American Association of Port Authorities
|title=World Port Ranking 2011}}</ref> The [[Hamburg America Line|Hamburg-America Line]], with [[Albert Ballin]] as its director, became the world's largest [[Atlantic Ocean|transatlantic]] shipping company around the start of the 20th century. Shipping companies sailing to South America, Africa, India and East Asia were based in the city. Hamburg was the departure port for many Germans and Eastern Europeans to emigrate to the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Trading communities from all over the world established themselves there.

A major [[1881–1896 cholera pandemic#1892 outbreak in Hamburg|outbreak of cholera in 1892]] was badly handled by the city government, which retained an unusual degree of independence for a German city. About 8,600 died in the largest German epidemic of the late 19th century, and the last major cholera epidemic in a major city of the Western world.

Hamburg was a ''Gau'' within the [[administrative division of Nazi Germany]] from 1934 until 1945. During the [[Second World War]], the [[bombing of Hamburg in World War II|Allied bombing of Hamburg]] devastated much of the city and the harbour. On 23 July 1943, the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[United States Army Air Force]] firebombing created a [[firestorm]] which spread from the ''Hauptbahnhof'' (main railway station) and quickly moved south-east, completely destroying entire boroughs such as [[Hammerbrook]], [[Billbrook]] and [[Hamm, Hamburg|Hamm South]]. Thousands of people perished in these densely populated working class boroughs. The raids, codenamed [[Operation Gomorrah]] by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], killed at least 42,600 civilians; the precise number is not known. About one million civilians were evacuated in the aftermath of the raids. While some of the boroughs destroyed were rebuilt as residential districts after the war, others such as Hammerbrook were entirely developed into office, retail and limited residential or industrial districts.

The [[Hamburg Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery]] is in the greater [[Ohlsdorf Cemetery]] in the north of Hamburg.

At least 42,900 people are thought to have perished<ref name="kz-neuengamme">{{cite web|url=http://www.kz-gedenkstaette-neuengamme.de |title=Gedenkstätte Konzentrationslager Neuengamme |publisher=Kz-gedenkstaette-neuengamme.de |access-date=14 September 2013}}</ref> in the [[Neuengamme concentration camp]] (about {{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on}} outside the city in the marshlands), mostly from epidemics and in the [[SS Cap Arcona (1927)|destruction of Kriegsmarine vessels]] housing evacuees at the end of the war.

Systematic [[Deportation#Deportation during World War II|deportations of Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent]] started on 18 October 1941. These were all directed to [[ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe]] or to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. Most deported persons perished in [[the Holocaust]]. By the end of 1942, the ''Jüdischer Religionsverband in Hamburg'' was dissolved as an independent legal entity and its remaining assets and staff were assumed by the [[Reich Association of Jews in Germany]] (District Northwest). On 10 June 1943, the [[Reich Security Main Office]] dissolved the association by a decree.<ref>Cf.

===Post-war history===
[[File:Phb dt 8107 CTA.jpg|thumb|Container Terminal at the Port of Hamburg]]
The city was surrendered to [[British Armed Forces|British Forces]] on 3 May 1945, in the [[Capture of Hamburg|Battle of Hamburg]],<ref>Ortwin Pelc, Kriegsende in Hamburg, Hamburg 2005</ref> three days after [[Adolf Hitler]]'s death. After the [[Second World War]], Hamburg formed part of the [[Allied-occupied Germany|British Zone of Occupation]]; it became a state of [[West Germany]] in 1949.

On 16 February 1962, a [[North Sea flood of 1962|North Sea flood]] caused the Elbe to rise to an all-time high, inundating one-fifth of Hamburg and killing more than 300 people.

The [[inner German border]] – only {{convert|50|km|mi|-1}} east of Hamburg – separated the city from most of its hinterland and reduced Hamburg's global trade. Since [[German reunification]] in 1990, and the accession of several Central European and [[Baltic region|Baltic]] countries into the [[European Union]] in 2004, the [[Port of Hamburg]] has restarted ambitions for regaining its position as the region's largest deep-sea port for container shipping and its major commercial and trading centre.

==Geography==
Hamburg is at a sheltered natural harbour on the southern fanning-out of the [[Jutland Peninsula]], between [[Continental Europe]] to the south and [[Scandinavia]] to the north, with the [[North Sea]] to the west and the [[Baltic Sea]] to the northeast. It is on the [[Elbe|River Elbe]] at its confluence with the [[Alster]] and [[Bille (Elbe)|Bille]]. The city centre is around the [[Binnenalster]] ("Inner Alster") and [[Außenalster]] ("Outer Alster"), both formed by damming the River Alster to create lakes. The islands of [[Neuwerk]], [[Scharhörn]], and [[Nigehörn]], {{convert|100|km|mi|-1}} away in the [[Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park]], are also part of the city of Hamburg.<ref>Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park Act {{Citation |title=Gesetz über den Nationalpark Hamburgisches Wattenmeer |url=http://www.landesrecht.hamburg.de/jportal/portal/page/bshaprod.psml?doc.id=jlr-WattMGHArahmen&st=lr&showdoccase=1&paramfromHL=true#focuspoint|date=9 April 1990 |access-date=26 February 2011|language=de}}</ref>

The neighbourhoods of [[Neuenfelde]], [[Cranz, Hamburg|Cranz]], Francop and [[Finkenwerder]] are part of the ''[[Altes Land]]'' (old land) region, the largest contiguous fruit-producing region in Central Europe.

===Climate===
Hamburg has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''; [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Dobk''), influenced by its proximity to the coast and maritime influences that originate over the Atlantic Ocean. The location in the north of Germany provides extremes greater than typical marine climates, but definitely in the category due to the prevailing westerlies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=74101&cityname=Hamburg,+Hamburg,+Germany&units=metric|title=Hamburg, Germany Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=7 February 2019|archive-date=25 July 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230725055124/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=74101&cityname=Hamburg,+Hamburg,+Germany&units=metric|url-status=dead}}</ref> Nearby wetlands enjoy a maritime temperate climate.

===Portuguese community===
Hamburg has the largest [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] community in Germany with about 30,000 people with [[Portuguese diaspora|Portuguese heritage]]. Many Portuguese sailors and merchants came to Hamburg beginning in the 15th century due to its [[Port of Hamburg|port]]. Since the 1970s, there has been a district in Hamburg called the {{Interlanguage link|Portugiesenviertel|de|Portugiesenviertel}} (Portuguese quarter) where many Portuguese people settled and which has a variety of Portuguese restaurants, cafes and shops that attract many tourists. There are several statues, squares and streets in Hamburg that are named after Portuguese historical figures. These include the [[Vasco da Gama]] statue on the Kornhaus bridge, which was suggested by Portuguese residents to bring visibility to the Portuguese community in Hamburg.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wie Portugiesen in Hamburg heimisch wurden |url=https://www.welt.de/wams_print/article1466208/Wie-Portugiesen-in-Hamburg-heimisch-wurden.html |website=www.welt.de |date=16 November 2011 |access-date=24 July 2023 |language=de}}</ref>

They first came to Hamburg in the 1970s before expanding during the [[Afghan conflict]] in the 1980s and 1990s where many Afghan migrants chose to live in Hamburg.<ref name="BPB">{{citation|url=https://www.bpb.de/gesellschaft/migration/laenderprofile/288934/afghan-migration-to-germany|title=Afghan Migration to Germany: History and Current Debates|date=5 April 2019 }}</ref> After 2015 the Afghan population almost doubled due to a new influx from the migrant crisis.

===Language===
{{See also|Hamburgisch dialect}}

As elsewhere in Germany, [[Standard German]] is spoken in Hamburg, but as typical for northern Germany, the original language of Hamburg is [[Low German]], usually referred to as ''Hamborger Platt'' (German ''Hamburger Platt'') or ''[[Hamburgisch|Hamborgsch]]''. Since large-scale [[Standard language|standardisation]] of the German language beginning in earnest in the 18th century, various Low German-coloured dialects have developed (contact-varieties of German on Low Saxon substrates). Originally, there was a range of such [[Missingsch]] varieties, the best-known being the low-prestige ones of the working classes and the somewhat more bourgeois ''Hanseatendeutsch'' (Hanseatic German), although the term is used in appreciation.<ref>{{Citation |contribution=Die deutsche Sprache—eine Dialektlandschaft |title=Nationalatlas Bundesrepublik Deutschland |last=Bausch |first=Karl-Heinz |url=http://www.ifl-nationalatlas.de/download/bsppdf/Band_6_bsp.pdf |year=2007 |access-date=24 September 2008 |publisher=Leibniz-Institut für Länderkunde |location=Leipzig |isbn=978-3-8274-0947-8 |pages=94–95 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719043439/http://www.ifl-nationalatlas.de/download/bsppdf/Band_6_bsp.pdf |archive-date=19 July 2011|language=de}}</ref> All of these are now moribund due to the influences of Standard German used by education and media. However, the former importance of Low German is indicated by several songs, such as the [[sea shanty]] [[Hamborger Veermaster]], written in the 19th century when Low German was used more frequently. Many toponyms and street names reflect Low Saxon vocabulary, partially even in Low Saxon spelling, which is not standardised, and to some part in forms adapted to Standard German.<ref>Several places are named ...brook (Billbrook, Brooktor, Grasbrook, Hammerbrook, Hellbrook, Iserbrook) rather than Standard German ...bruch (neutr.; =brook riverscape), Bullenhusen rather than Bullenhausen, Lohbrügge rather than Lohbrücke, several localities starting with Nien... (Niendorf, Nienstedten) rather than Neuen..., or ending ...hude (Dockenhuden, Harvestehude, Winterhude) rather than ...hut[ung] (fem.; =pasture), Uhlenhorst rather than Eulenhorst, several places and water bodies are named ...bek (Barmbek, Eilbek, Fischbek, Flottbek, Goldbek, Isebek, Kirchsteinbek, Langenbek, Osterbek, Pepermölenbek, Wandsbek) rather than ...bach, several places and water bodies are called ...fleet (Alsterfleet, Bleichenfleet, Moorfleet) rather than ...fließ (=brook, stream). Further toponyms with no close Standard German correspondents appear, such as ...büttel (=inhabited place; Eimsbüttel, Fuhlsbüttel, Hummelsbüttel, Poppenbüttel, Wellingsbüttel) or Twiete (=alley wedged between buildings). Like in other parts of Northern Germany ...stedt (Bergstedt, Billstedt, Duvenstedt, Eidelstedt, Lokstedt, Mellingstedt, Nienstedten, Ohlstedt, Rahlstedt) prevails over ...stadt (=town, originally simply stead).</ref>

The city of Hamburg is one of 16 [[States of Germany|German states]], therefore the [[Government of Hamburg|Mayor of Hamburg]]'s office corresponds more to the role of a [[minister-president]] than to the one of a city mayor. As a [[States of Germany#Politics|German state government]], it is responsible for public education, correctional institutions and public safety; as a municipality, it is additionally responsible for libraries, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply and welfare services.

Since 1897, the seat of the government has been [[Hamburg City Hall]] (Hamburg Rathaus), with the office of the mayor, the meeting room for the Senate and the floor for the [[Hamburg Parliament]].<ref name=rathaus>{{Citation |title=Kleiner Rathausführer |location=Hamburg |publisher=[[Government of Hamburg#Ministries|State Chancellery]] |year=2006|language=de}}</ref> From 2001 until 2010, the mayor of Hamburg was [[Ole von Beust]],<ref name=usatoday2008>{{Citation |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-02-24-Germany-elections_N.htm |title=German conservatives win most votes |access-date=13 August 2008 |work=USA Today |date=24 February 2008}}</ref> who governed in Germany's first statewide "black-green" coalition, consisting of the conservative [[CDU Hamburg]] and the alternative GAL, which are Hamburg's regional wing of the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Alliance 90/The Greens]] party.<ref>{{Citation

===Boroughs===
{{Main|Boroughs and quarters of Hamburg}}
[[File:Hamburg Subdivisions.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The 7 boroughs and 104 quarters of Hamburg]]

Hamburg is made up of seven boroughs (German: ''Bezirke'') and subdivided into 104 quarters (German: ''Stadtteile''). There are 181 localities (German: ''Ortsteile''). The urban organisation is regulated by the Constitution of Hamburg and several laws.<ref name=constitution/><ref name=borough>Borough Administration Act {{Citation |title=Bezirksverwaltungsgesetz (BezVG) |url=http://hh.juris.de/hh/gesamt/BezVwG_HA_2006.htm |access-date=21 September 2008 |date=6 July 2006 |language=de |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070813163835/http://hh.juris.de/hh/gesamt/BezVwG_HA_2006.htm |archive-date=13 August 2007 }}</ref> Most of the quarters were former independent cities, towns or villages annexed into Hamburg proper. The last large annexation was done through the [[Greater Hamburg Act]] of 1937, when the cities [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], [[Harburg, Hamburg|Harburg]], and [[Hamburg-Wandsbek|Wandsbek]] were merged into the state of Hamburg.<ref name=greateract>[[Greater Hamburg Act]] {{Citation |title=Groß-Hamburg-Gesetz |url=http://www.verfassungen.de/de/hh/hamburg37.htm |date=26 January 1937 |access-date=24 September 2008 |language=de |archive-date=17 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117155225/http://www.verfassungen.de/de/hh/hamburg37.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> The ''Act of the Constitution and Administration of Hanseatic city of Hamburg'' established Hamburg as a state and a municipality.<ref name=reichconst>Reich Act of the Constitution and Administration of Hanseatic city of Hamburg {{Citation |title=Reichsgesetz über die Verfassung und Verwaltung der Hansestadt Hamburg |url=http://www.verfassungen.de/de/hh/hamburg37-1.htm |date=9 December 1937 |access-date=24 September 2008 |language=de |archive-date=27 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227082432/http://www.verfassungen.de/de/hh/hamburg37-1.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> Some of the boroughs and quarters have been rearranged several times.

Each borough is governed by a Borough Council (German: ''Bezirksversammlung'') and administered by a Municipal Administrator (German: ''Bezirksamtsleiter''). The boroughs are not independent municipalities: their power is limited and subordinate to the [[Mayor of Hamburg|Senate of Hamburg]]. The borough administrator is elected by the Borough Council and thereafter requires confirmation and appointment by Hamburg's Senate.<ref name=borough/> The quarters have no governing bodies of their own.

Hamburg has architecturally significant buildings in a wide range of styles and just one skyscraper under construction (see [[List of tallest buildings in Hamburg]]). Churches are important landmarks, such as [[St. Nikolai, Hamburg|St Nicholas']], which for a short time in the 19th century was the world's tallest building.

The lavish and spacious ''[[Planten un Blomen]]'' park (Low German dialect for "plants and flowers") located in the centre of Hamburg is the green heart of the city. Within the park are various thematic gardens, the biggest Japanese garden in Germany, and the ''[[Alter Botanischer Garten Hamburg]]'', which is a historic [[botanical garden]] that now consists primarily of [[greenhouse]]s.

The ''[[Botanischer Garten Hamburg]]'' is a modern [[botanical garden]] maintained by the [[University of Hamburg]]. Besides these, there are many more parks of various sizes. In 2014 Hamburg celebrated a birthday of park culture, where many parks were reconstructed and cleaned up. Moreover, every year there are water-light-concerts in the ''[[Planten un Blomen]]'' park, from May to early October.

===Museums===
{{See also|List of museums in Hamburg}}
Hamburg has several large museums and galleries showing classical and contemporary art, for example the [[Kunsthalle Hamburg]] with its contemporary art gallery (''Galerie der Gegenwart''), the ''[[Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg|Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe]]'' (Museum of Art and Design), and the [[Deichtorhallen]] (with the House of Photography and Hall of Contemporary Art). The [[Internationales Maritimes Museum Hamburg]] opened in the HafenCity quarter in 2008. There are various specialised museums in Hamburg, such as the ''[[Archäologisches Museum Hamburg]]'' (Hamburg Archaeological Museum) in the [[Hamburg-Harburg|Harburg]] borough, the [[Hamburg Museum of Work]] (''Museum der Arbeit''), and several museums of local history, such as the {{ill|Kiekeberg Open Air Museum|de|Freilichtmuseum am Kiekeberg}} (''Freilichtmuseum am Kiekeberg'') at [[Kiekeberg]] in the [[Harburg Hills]], just outside of Hamburg, in [[Rosengarten, Lower Saxony|Rosengarten]].

[[BallinStadt]], a memorial park and former emigration station, is dedicated to the millions of Europeans who emigrated to North and South America between 1850 and 1939. Visitors descending from those overseas emigrants may search for their ancestors at computer terminals.

===Music===
[[File:Hamburg-Elbphilharmonie.jpg|thumb|The {{convert|110|m|ft|0|abbr=off|adj=mid|-high}} Elbphilharmonie concert hall]]
[[Hamburg State Opera]] is a leading opera company. Its orchestra is the [[Philharmoniker Hamburg]]. The city's other major orchestra is the [[NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchestra]]. The main concert venue is the new concert hall [[Elbphilharmonie]]. Before it was the [[Laeiszhalle]], ''Musikhalle Hamburg''. The Laeiszhalle also houses a third orchestra, the [[Hamburger Symphoniker]].

Hamburg is the birthplace of [[Johannes Brahms]], who spent his formative early years in the city, and the birthplace and home of waltz composer [[Oscar Fetrás]], who wrote the "Mondnacht auf der Alster" waltz.

Since the German premiere of ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' in 1986, there have always been musicals running, including ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'', ''[[Dirty Dancing#Stage adaptation|Dirty Dancing]]'', and ''[[Dance of the Vampires (musical)]]''. This density, the highest in Germany, is partly due to the major musical production company ''[[Stage Entertainment]]'' being based in the city.

In addition to musicals, opera houses, concert halls, and theatres, the cityscape is characterised by a large music scene. This includes, among other things, over 100 music venues, several annual festivals and over 50 event organisers based in Hamburg.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clubkombinat.de/presse/|title=Presse- und Öffentlichkeitsarbeit|date=10 May 2021 |accessdate=27 June 2023}}</ref> Larger venues include the [[Barclaycard Arena (Hamburg)|Barclaycard Arena]], the [[Trabrennbahn Bahrenfeld|Bahrenfeld harness racing track]], and [[Hamburg Stadtpark|Hamburg City Park]].

Hamburg was an important centre of rock music in the early 1960s. [[The Beatles]] lived and played in Hamburg from August 1960 to December 1962. They proved popular and gained local acclaim. Prior to the group's initial recording and widespread fame, Hamburg provided residency and performing venues for the band during the time they performed there. One of the venues they performed at was the [[Star-Club|Star Club]] on St. Pauli.

Pop musicians from Hamburg include [[Udo Lindenberg]], [[Deichkind]], and [[Jan Delay]]. The singer [[Annett Louisan]] lives in the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Annett Louisan Annett Louisan {{!}} Home |url=https://www.annettlouisan.de/ |access-date=2024-07-07 |website=www.annettlouisan.de |language=de}}</ref>

An important meeting place for Hamburg musicians from the 1970s to the mid-80s was the jazz pub [[Onkel Pö]], which was originally founded in the Pöseldorf neighbourhood and later moved to Eppendorf. Many musicians who were counted as part of the "{{ill|Hamburg scene|de|Hamburger_Szene|vertical-align=sup}}" met here. In addition to Udo Lindenberg, these included [[Otto Waalkes]], Hans Scheibner and groups such as [[Torfrock]] and [[Frumpy]]. One of the members of the band Frumpy was the Hamburg-born singer and composer [[Inga Rumpf]].

Hamburg is the origin of the "[[Hamburger Schule]]", a term used for alternative music bands like [[Tocotronic]], [[Blumfeld]], [[Tomte (band)|Tomte]] or Kante. The meeting point of the Hamburg School was long considered to be the {{ill|Golden Pudel Club|de|Golden_Pudel_Club|vertical-align=sup}} in Altona's old town, near the Fischmarkt. Alongside clubs such as the Pal, the Moondoo or the Waagenbau, today the Pudel is a central location of the Hamburg electro scene. Artists of this scene include the DJ duo [[Moonbootica]], Mladen Solomun, and [[Helena Hauff]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Elektronische Musik – Vom Kult am Mischpult|url=https://www.hamburg-tourism.de/das-ist-hamburg/musikmetropole/musik-live-in-hamburg/elektronische-musik/|website=Hamburg Tourismus}}</ref>

Hamburg is also home to many music labels, music distributors and publishers. These include [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music]], [[Kontor Records]], [[PIAS Recordings|PIAS]], [[Edel SE & Co. KGaA]], Believe Digital, and Indigo. The high proportion of independent labels in the city, which include [[Audiolith Records|Audiolith]], Dial Records, [[Grand Hotel van Cleef]], among others, is striking. Before its closure, the label [[L'Age D'Or (record label)|L'Âge d'or]] also belonged to these.

In addition, Hamburg has a considerable [[alternative rock|alternative]] and [[punk rock|punk]] scene, which gathers around the [[Rote Flora]], a [[squatting|squatted]] former theatre located in the [[Sternschanze]].

The city was a major centre for [[heavy metal music]] in the 1980s. [[Helloween]], [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]], [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]], and [[Grave Digger (band)|Grave Digger]] started in Hamburg.<ref>{{Citation|last=Rivadavia|first=Eduardo|title=allmusic (((Helloween> Biography )))|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4471|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=allmusic|access-date=24 September 2008}}</ref> The [[industrial rock]] band [[KMFDM]] was also formed in Hamburg, initially as a performance art project. The influences of these and other bands from the area helped establish the subgenre of [[power metal]].

In the late 1990s, Hamburg was considered one of the strongholds of the German hip-hop scene. Bands like [[Beginner (band)|Beginner]] shaped the city's hip-hop style and made it a serious location for the hip-hop scene through songs like "Hamburg City Blues". In addition to Beginner, German hip-hop acts from Hamburg include [[Fünf Sterne deluxe|Fünf Sterne Deluxe]], [[Samy Deluxe]], [[Fettes Brot]], and [[187 Strassenbande]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://marketing.hamburg.de/hamburg-die-pulsierende-hip-hop-metropole.html|title=Hamburg – die pulsierende Hip-Hop Metropole – Hamburg Marketing|website=marketing.hamburg.de}}</ref>

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Cuisine of Hamburg}}
[[File:2017-05-01 Scholle Finkenwerder Art.JPG|thumb|Fried [[plaice]], [[Finkenwerder]] style]]

Original Hamburg dishes are ''[[Birnen, Bohnen und Speck]]'' (green beans cooked with pears and bacon).<ref>{{Citation |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/07/05/43504.html |title=Birnen, Bohnen, Speck – Schmeckt vorzüglich |date=5 July 2002 |access-date=11 August 2008|language=de}}</ref> ''Aalsuppe'' ([[Hamburgisch dialect|Hamburgisch]] ''Oolsupp'') is often mistaken to be German for "eel soup" (''Aal''/''Ool'' translated 'eel'), but the name probably comes from the Low Saxon ''allns'' {{IPA|[aˑlns]}}, meaning "all", "everything and the kitchen sink", not necessarily eel. Today eel is often included to meet the expectations of unsuspecting diners.<ref>{{Citation |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/06/25/39651.html |title=Aalsuppe – Frage des Geschmacks |date=25 June 2002|access-date=11 August 2008|language=de}}</ref> There is ''Bratkartoffeln'' ([[Home fries|pan-fried potato slices]]), ''Finkenwerder Scholle'' (Low Saxon ''Finkwarder Scholl'', pan-fried plaice), ''Pannfisch'' (pan-fried fish with mustard sauce),<ref>{{Citation |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/06/25/39713.html |title=Maischollen – Zart gebraten |date=25 June 2002 |access-date=11 August 2008|language=de}}</ref> ''[[Rødgrød|Rote Grütze]]'' (Low Saxon ''Rode Grütt'', related to Danish ''[[rødgrød]]'', a type of summer pudding made mostly from berries and usually served with cream, like Danish ''rødgrød med fløde''),<ref>{{Citation |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=Hamburger Abendbla |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/06/25/39656.html |title=Grütze – Mit kalter Milch |date=25 June 2002 |access-date=11 August 2008|language=de}}</ref> and ''[[Labskaus]]'' (a mixture of corned beef, mashed potatoes, and beetroot, a cousin of the Norwegian ''lapskaus'' and [[Liverpool]]'s [[Scouse (food)|lobscouse]], all offshoots off an old-time one-pot meal that used to be the main component of the common sailor's humdrum diet on the high seas).<ref>{{Citation |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/06/25/39664.html |title=Labskaus – Essen der Matrosen |date=25 June 2002 |access-date=11 August 2008|language=de}}</ref>

''Alsterwasser'' (in reference to the city's river, the [[Alster]]) is the local name for a type of [[shandy]], a concoction of equal parts of beer and carbonated lemonade (''Zitronenlimonade''), the lemonade being added to the beer.<ref>{{Citation |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/08/01/52867.html |title=Alsterwasser – Bier und Limonade |date=10 August 2002 |access-date=11 August 2008|language=de}}</ref>

A regional dessert pastry called "[[Franzbrötchen]]" is similar in preparation to a [[croissant]], but includes a cinnamon and sugar filling, often with raisins or brown sugar [[streusel]]. Ordinary bread rolls tend to be oval-shaped and of the French bread variety. The local name is ''Schrippe'' (scored lengthways) for the oval kind and, for the round kind, ''Rundstück'' ("round piece" rather than mainstream German ''[[Brötchen]]'', diminutive form of ''Brot'' "bread"),<ref>{{Citation |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/08/05/53895.html |title=Rundstück – Hamburger Brötchen |date=5 August 2002 |access-date=6 June 2008|language=de}}</ref> a relative of Denmark's ''rundstykke''. The cuisines of Hamburg and [[Denmark]], especially of [[Copenhagen]], have a lot in common. This also includes a predilection for open-faced sandwiches of all sorts, especially topped with cold-smoked or pickled fish.{{fact|date=January 2024}}

The American [[hamburger]] may have developed from Hamburg's ''[[Frikadeller]]'': a pan-fried patty (usually larger and thicker than its American counterpart) made from a mixture of ground beef, soaked [[staling|stale bread]], egg, chopped onion, salt, and pepper, usually served with potatoes and vegetables like any other piece of meat, not usually on a bun. The Oxford Dictionary defined a ''Hamburger steak'' in 1802: a sometimes-smoked and -salted piece of meat, that, according to some sources, came from Hamburg to America.<ref>{{Citation |last=Stradley |first=Linda |title=History of Hamburgers |url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/HamburgerHistory.htm |year=2004 |access-date=23 August 2008}}</ref> The name and food, "hamburger", has entered all English-speaking countries, and derivative words in non-English speaking countries.

There are restaurants which offer most of these dishes, especially in the [[HafenCity]].

===Alternative culture===
Hamburg has long been a centre of alternative music and counter-culture movements. The boroughs of [[St. Pauli]], [[Sternschanze]], and [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] are known for being home to many radical left-wing and anarchist groups, culminating every year during the traditional May Day demonstrations.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/gesellschaft/1-mai-demo-in-hamburg-was-soll-der-krawall-auf-der-schanze-noch-a-1090104.html |title=1.

During the [[2017 G20 Hamburg summit|2017 G20 summit]], which took place in Hamburg from 7–8 July that year, protestors clashed violently with the police in the [[Sternschanze]] area and particularly around the Rote Flora. On 7 July, several cars were set on fire and street barricades were erected to prevent the police from entering the area. In response to that, the police made heavy use of water cannons and tear gas in order to scatter the protestors. However, this was met with strong resistance by protestors, resulting in a total of 160 injured police and 75 arrested participants in the protests.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/video/g20-gipfel-in-hamburg-randalierer-setzen-autos-in-brand-video-1780686.html |title=Raid of "Krawalle beim G20-Gipfel – Randalierer setzen Autos in Brand |newspaper=Der Spiegel |date=7 July 2017 |access-date= 11 July 2017|publisher=spiegel.de}}</ref>

After the summit, however, the Rote Flora issued a statement, in which it condemns the arbitrary acts of violence that were committed by some of the protestors whilst generally defending the right to use violence as a means of self-defence against police oppression. In particular, the spokesperson of the Rote Flora said that the autonomous cultural centre had a traditionally good relationship with its neighbours and local residents, since they were united in their fight against gentrification in that neighbourhood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rp-online.de/politik/deutschland/g20-gipfel-rote-flora-distanziert-sich-von-gewaltausbruechen-aid-1.6935697 |title=Krawalle in Hamburg beim G20-Gipfel – Rote Flora distanziert sich von Gewaltausbrüchen |date=8 July 2017 |access-date= 11 July 2017|publisher=rp-online.de}}</ref>

[[File:Projekt Heißluftballon - Highflyer -IMG-1414.jpg|thumb|Western HafenCity area and Speicherstadt]]
The HafenCity is Europe's largest urban development project and is located in the [[Hamburg-Mitte]] district. It consists of the area of the Great Grasbrook, the northern part of the former Elbe island [[Grasbrook]], and the warehouse district on the former Elbe island Kehrwieder and Wandrahm. It is bordered to the north, separated by the customs channel to Hamburg's city centre, west and south by the Elbe, and to the east, bounded by the upper harbour, [[Rothenburgsort]]. The district is full of rivers and streams and is surrounded by channels, and has a total area of about 2.2&nbsp;square-kilometres.

HafenCity has {{convert|155|ha|lk=on|0}} in the area formerly belonging to the free port north of the Great Grasbrook. Residential units for up to 12,000 people are planned to be built on the site by around the mid-2020s, and jobs for up to 40,000 people, mainly in the office sector, should be created. It is the largest ongoing urban development project in Hamburg.

Construction work started in 2003, and in 2009 the first part of the urban development project was finished with the completion of the Dalmannkai / Sandtorkai neighbourhood – which is the first stage of the HafenCity project. According to the person responsible for the development and commercialisation of HafenCity, ''HafenCity Hamburg GmbH'', half of the master plan underlying structural construction is already completed, whereas the other half is either under construction or is in the construction preparation stages.

Hamburg's [[Vehicle registration plates of Germany|licence plate]] prefix was "HH" (Hansestadt Hamburg; English: Hanseatic City of Hamburg) between 1906 and 1945 and from 1956 onwards, rather than the single letter normally used for large cities since the federal registration reform in 1956, such as B for Berlin or M for Munich. "H" was Hamburg's prefix in the years between 1945 and 1947 (used by [[Hanover]] since 1956).<ref>other prefixes used between 1945 and 1956 were "MGH" (Military Government, Hamburg: 1945 only), "HG" (1947 only) and "BH" (British Zone, Hamburg) between 1948 and 1956.</ref>

=== Public transport ===
[[File:Bahnlinien im HVV.png|thumb|A map of the transit rail lines in Hamburg]] Public transport by rail, bus, and ship is organised by the ''[[Hamburger Verkehrsverbund]]'' ("Hamburg transit authority") (HVV). Tickets sold by one company are valid on all other HVV companies' services.

Older residents still speak of the system as ''Hochbahn'' (elevated railway), also because the operating company of the subway is the ''[[Hamburger Hochbahn]]''. The [[AKN Eisenbahn|AKN railway]] connects satellite towns in Schleswig-Holstein to the city. On some routes regional trains of Germany's major railway company [[Deutsche Bahn|Deutsche Bahn AG]] and the regional ''[[metronom Eisenbahngesellschaft|metronom]]'' trains may be used with an HVV ticket. Regional trains stop at various stations within city limits such as the four larger stations, [[Hamburg Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]], [[Hamburg Dammtor station|Dammtor]], [[Hamburg-Altona station|Altona]], and [[Hamburg-Harburg station|Harburg]], as well as Hamburg Hasselbrook and Hamburg Bergedorf.

The buses run frequently during working hours, with buses on the [[Metrobus (Germany)|MetroBus]] routes running every ten minutes from 6 am to 9 pm. On special weekday night lines the intervals can be 30 minutes or more, while on normal days (Monday-Friday) normal buses stop running at night (some lines run 24 hours a day, every day of the year at least every half hour).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bus Hamburg |url=https://www.hamburg.de/bus/2310408/busse-in-hamburg/ |access-date=2023-09-30 |website=hamburg.de |language=de}}</ref>
