On 18 March, it was reported that protests had once again appeared in the city.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} By early April 2011, the uprising, having been brutally quashed, the city was " back under Gaddafi's thumb after daring to rise up in his very own backyard." The main mosque that overlooked Martyrs' Square where the injured and dying were treated when Gaddafi's tanks and snipers moved in, had been "completely destroyed, not a trace left." Thousands of Zawiyans had been taken away for questioning in the last few weeks, according to rebel sources.<ref>Jonathan Rugman, reporting on Channel Four News, 5 April 2011, and The Independent, 6 April 2011, ''Gaddafi's men try to obliterate traces of massacre in Zawiya'', [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/gaddafis-men-try-to-obliterate-traces-of-massacre-in-zawiya-2263670.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022032755/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/gaddafis-men-try-to-obliterate-traces-of-massacre-in-zawiya-2263670.html |date=22 October 2017 }}</ref> Un-confirmed reports stated that as many as 10 anti-Gaddafi fighters were buried in the town center. After the battle, no trace of the graves or bodies was seen.

Since Gaddafi's troops took control of Zawiya, the revolutionaries have been using guerrilla action against Gaddafi's soldiers. On various occasions rebels have ambushed Gaddafi's men but had to use night cover to prevent detection.

On 11 June, around one hundred rebels infiltrated the city and claimed that they won control of some sections, marking the first significant clashes between loyalist and opposition forces since it was [[First Battle of Zawiya|recaptured]] by Gaddafi's troops in March. Due to the ongoing fighting, loyalist forces closed down a highway that crosses the town, a key expressway for Gaddafi's war effort.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-idUSTRE7270JP20110611|title=Fighting in Zawiya shuts Libya road to Tripoli|work=[[Reuters]]|last=Graff|first=Peter|date=11 June 2011|access-date=11 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611223350/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/11/us-libya-idUSTRE7270JP20110611|archive-date=11 June 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> The next day, rebels were pushed out of the city by Gaddafi brigades and the road to the city reopened.
