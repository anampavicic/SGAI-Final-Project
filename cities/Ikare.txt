==Inter ethnic relationships==

Ikare though basically a Yoruba ethnic city, is also a place of convergence in Ondo State for many ethnic groups in Nigeria including the [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Fula people|Fulani]], and [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]]. The friendly disposition of its natives to visitors and holiday makers, from time immemorial, is perhaps responsible for the growing number of settlers in the city.
