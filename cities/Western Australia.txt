'''Western Australia''' (WA) is the westernmost [[state of Australia]]. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean to the north and west, the [[Southern Ocean]] to the south, the [[Northern Territory]] to the north-east, and [[South Australia]] to the south-east. Western Australia is Australia’s largest state, with a land area of {{convert|2527013|km2}},<ref name="ga20" /> and is also the [[List of country subdivisions by area|second-largest subdivision]] of any country on Earth, surpassed only by the [[Sakha Republic]] in eastern Russia, and formerly Northwest Territories in Canada, before the creation of Nunavut. It is also the largest proper subnational entity, being a state rather than a territory or an autonomous region.

Western Australia has a diverse range of climates, including tropical conditions in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]], deserts in the interior (including the [[Great Sandy Desert]], [[Little Sandy Desert]], [[Gibson Desert]], and [[Great Victoria Desert]]) and a [[Mediterranean climate]] on the south-west and southern coastal areas. {{As of|2021|post=,}} the state has 2.91&nbsp;million inhabitants—{{#expr: (2762.2 / 25756.6 * 100) round 0}} percent of the national total.<ref>{{Cite web|date=22 March 2024|title=National, state and territory population, March 2024 {{!}} Australian Department of Treasury|url=https://www.wa.gov.au/organisation/department-of-treasury/population}}</ref> Over 90 percent of the state's population live in the [[South-West Land Division|south-west corner]] and around 80 percent live in the state capital [[Perth]],<ref name=ABSCapitalPop/> leaving the remainder of the state sparsely populated. The [[Trans-Australian Railway]] and the [[Eyre Highway]] traverse the [[Nullarbor Plain]] in the state's south-east, providing the principal connection between Western Australia and the population centres in the [[Eastern states of Australia|eastern states]].

Western Australia's [[Aboriginal cultures of Western Australia|Indigenous peoples]] have been present for tens of thousands of years. Dutch explorers visited Western Australia from the 17th century, with [[Dirk Hartog]]'s 1616 expedition the first Europeans to make landfall. The British claimed Western Australia in 1827 and established the [[Swan River Colony]] with Perth as its capital in 1829. The [[Western Australian gold rushes]] of the late 19th century resulted in a significant population influx. The colony was granted [[responsible government]] in 1890, the last of the Australian colonies to become self-governing, and [[Federation of Australia|federated]] with the other colonies in 1901.

Western Australia's [[Mining in Western Australia|mining sector]] is a key driver of the [[Economy of Western Australia|state economy]]. The late 20th century saw the development of the state's significant [[Iron ore mining in Western Australia|iron ore mining industry]] – the world's largest – as well as primarily offshore [[Petroleum industry in Western Australia|petroleum and natural gas resources]]. [[Gold mining in Western Australia|Gold mining]] retains a significant presence and many other mineral commodities are mined, with Perth being a major centre for associated services. Outside of mining, primary industry is the other significant contributor to the state's economy, including agriculture in the [[Wheatbelt (Western Australia)|Wheatbelt]] and temperate southern coastal regions, [[List of pastoral leases in Western Australia|pastoralism]] in marginal grassland areas, [[Forests of Australia|forestry]] in the south-west and fishing (including [[Pearling in Western Australia|pearling]] and, historically, [[Whaling in Western Australia|whaling]]).

==History==
{{Main|History of Western Australia}}
{{See also|French Western Australia}}

Western Australia has a geological history dating back to 4.4 billion years ago when [[Hadean zircon]]s were formed. The earliest direct known life on land, known as [[stromatolite]]s, started to be created by microbes at around 3.48 billion years ago.

The first human inhabitants of Australia arrived from the north "over 50,000 years ago and possibly as much as 70,000 years ago".<ref name="men22">{{cite Q |Q127496561 |mode=cs1 |url-status=live |access-date=2024-05-19 }}</ref>{{rp|5}} Over thousands of years they eventually spread across the whole landmass.{{cn |date=June 2024}} These [[Indigenous Australians]] were long established throughout Western Australia by the time European explorers began to arrive in the early 17th century.

The first Europeans to visit Western Australia were those of the Dutch [[Dirk Hartog]] expedition, who on 25 October 1616 landed at what is now known as Cape Inscription, [[Dirk Hartog Island]]. For the rest of the 17th century, [[European maritime exploration of Australia|other Dutch and British navigators]] encountered the coast of what [[Abel Tasman]] named [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] in 1644, usually unintentionally as demonstrated by the many shipwrecks along the coast of ships that deviated from the [[Brouwer Route]] (because of poor navigation and storms).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Green |first=J.N. |date=1977 |title=Australia's oldest wreck: The Loss of the Trial, 1622 |url=http://museum.wa.gov.au/maritime-archaeology-db/sites/default/files/no._278_trial_bar_1977_0.pdf |journal=British Archaeological Reports, Supplementary Series |volume=27 |location=Oxford}}</ref> By the late 18th century, British and French sailors had begun to explore the Western Australian coast. The [[Baudin expedition to Australia|Baudin expedition]] of 1800–03 included the coast of Western Australia and resulted in the [[Freycinet Map of 1811]], the first published map featuring the full outline of Australia. The name New Holland remained in popular and semi-official use until at least the mid-1850s; that is, it was in use for about {{#expr: 1850 - 1644}} years in comparison to the name Australia which to date has been in use for about {{#expr: floor( ( {{CURRENTJULIANDAY}} - {{JULIANDAY|1829}} ) / 365.25 ) }} years.<ref name="wayb79" />{{rp|11}}

The origins of the present state began with the establishment by Lockyer<ref name="Western Australia Foundation"/> of a convict-supported settlement from [[New South Wales]] at [[King George Sound|King George III Sound]]. The settlement was formally annexed on 21 January 1827 by Lockyer when he commanded the [[Union Jack]] be raised and a [[feu de joie]] fired by the troops. The settlement was founded in response to British concerns about the possibility of a French colony being established on the coast of Western Australia.<ref name="Western Australia Foundation"/> On 7 March 1831 it was transferred to the control of the Swan River Colony,<ref name=knibbs/> and named [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] in 1832.

In 1829 the [[Swan River Colony]] was established on the Swan River by Captain [[James Stirling (Australian governor)|James Stirling]]. By 1832, the British settler population of the colony had reached around 1,500, and the official name of the colony was changed to Western Australia on 6 February that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://poi-australia.com.au/swan-river-colony-proclaimed/|title=Swan River Colony Proclaimed|date=2 May 1829|publisher=POI Australia|language=English|accessdate=13 February 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://statelibrarynsw.tumblr.com/post/156855938896/on-this-day-6th-february-1832-the-swan-river|title=On this day, 6th February 1832|newspaper=State Library of New South Wales|language=English|accessdate=13 February 2021}}</ref> The two separate townsites of the colony developed slowly into the port city of [[Fremantle]] and the state's capital, [[Perth]]. [[York, Western Australia|York]] was the first inland settlement in Western Australia, situated {{convert|97|km}} east of Perth and settled on 16 September 1831. York was the staging point for early explorers who discovered the rich gold reserves of Kalgoorlie.

Population growth was very slow until significant discoveries of gold were made in the 1890s around [[Kalgoorlie]].

[[File:John Forrest 1898.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John Forrest]] was the first Premier of Western Australia.]]

In 1887, a new constitution was drafted, providing for the right of self-governance of European Australians, and in 1890, the act granting [[self-governing colony|self-government]] to the colony was passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]]. [[John Forrest]] became the first [[Premier of Western Australia]].

In 1896, after discoveries of gold at [[Coolgardie, Western Australia|Coolgardie]] and [[Kalgoorlie]], the [[Western Australian Parliament]] authorised the raising of a loan to construct a [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] to transport {{convert|5|e6impgal|ML|order=flip|abbr=off}} of water per day to the burgeoning population on the goldfields. The pipeline, known as the [[Goldfields Water Supply Scheme]], was completed in 1903. [[C. Y. O'Connor|{{thinspace|C. Y.}} O'Connor]], Western Australia's first engineer-in-chief, designed and oversaw the construction of the pipeline. It carries water {{convert|530|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Perth to [[Kalgoorlie]], and is attributed by historians as an important factor driving the state's population and economic growth.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A110059b.htm |title=''O'Connor, Charles Yelverton (1843–1902)'' |author=Tauman, Merab Harris |chapter=Charles Yelverton O'Connor (1843–1902) |publisher=[[Melbourne University Press|MUP]] |year=1988 |pages=51–54 |access-date=12 July 2008}}</ref>

Following a campaign led by Forrest, electors of the colony of Western Australia voted in favour of [[Federation of Australia|federation]] with the five other Australian colonies, resulting in Western Australia officially becoming a state on 1 January 1901.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hawkins |first1=John Robert |title=John Forrest: Four times treasurer |url=https://treasury.gov.au/sites/default/files/2019-03/08_John_Forrest.pdf |publisher=University of Canberra |access-date=3 May 2023 |date=2007}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Western Australia}}
Western Australia is bounded to the east by longitude 129°E, the meridian 129 degrees east of Greenwich, which defines the border with South Australia and the [[Northern Territory]], and bounded by the Indian Ocean to the west and north. The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO) designates the [[Australia and the Southern Ocean|body of water south of the continent]] as part of the Indian Ocean; in Australia it is officially gazetted as the [[Southern Ocean]].{{efn|In Australia, the [[Southern Ocean|body of water south of the continent]] is officially gazetted as the [[Southern Ocean]], whereas the [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO) designates it as part of the Indian Ocean.<ref name="iho53" /><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/21/1071941610556.html |title=Canberra all at sea over position of Southern Ocean |website=Theage.com.au |date=22 December 2003 |access-date=2 November 2012}}</ref>}}<ref name="iho53">{{cite book |title=Limits of Oceans and Seas |year=1953 |edition=3rd |url=http://www.iho.shom.fr/publicat/free/files/S23_1953.pdf |series=Special Publication No. 23 |publisher=International Hydrographic Organization |location=Monte Carlo |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007114205/http://www.iho.shom.fr/publicat/free/files/S23_1953.pdf |archive-date=7 October 2009 |access-date=24 September 2021 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/canberra-all-at-sea-over-position-of-southern-ocean-20031222-gdwzeb.html |title=Canberra all at sea over position of Southern Ocean|date=22 December 2003 |newspaper=[[The Age]] |access-date=17 February 2019 |oclc=224683742}}</ref>

===Geology===
The bulk of Western Australia consists of the extremely old [[Yilgarn craton]] and [[Pilbara craton]] which merged with the [[Deccan Plateau]] of India, [[Madagascar]] and the [[Kaapvaal Craton|Kaapvaal]] and [[Zimbabwe]] cratons of Southern Africa, in the [[Archean]] Eon to form [[Ur (continent)|Ur]], one of the oldest [[supercontinent]]s on Earth (3 – 3.2 &nbsp;billion years ago). In May 2017, evidence of the [[Earliest known life forms|earliest known life]] [[Evolutionary history of life#Colonization of land|on land]] may have been found in 3.48-billion-year-old [[geyserite]] and other related mineral deposits (often found around [[hot spring]]s and [[geyser]]s) uncovered in the Pilbara craton.<ref name="PO-20170509">{{cite news |title=Oldest evidence of life on land found in 3.48-billion-year-old Australian rocks |url=https://phys.org/news/2017-05-oldest-evidence-life-billion-year-old-australian.html |date=9 May 2017 |website=[[Phys.org]] |access-date=13 May 2017 }}</ref><ref name="NC-20170509">{{cite journal |last1=Djokic |first1=Tara |last2=Van Kranendonk |first2=Martin J. |last3=Campbell |first3=Kathleen A. |last4=Walter |first4=Malcolm R. |last5=Ward |first5=Colin R. |title=Earliest signs of life on land preserved in ca. 3.5 Ga hot spring deposits |date=9 May 2017 |journal=[[Nature Communications]] |volume=8 |pages=15263 |doi=10.1038/ncomms15263 |pmid=28486437 |pmc=5436104 |bibcode=2017NatCo...815263D }}</ref>

Because the only [[orogeny|mountain-building]] since then has been of the [[Stirling Range]] with the rifting from [[Antarctica]], the land is extremely eroded and ancient, with no part of the state above 1,249 metres (4,098&nbsp;ft) [[Australian Height Datum|AHD]] (at [[Mount Meharry]] in the [[Hamersley Range]] of the [[Pilbara]] region). Most of the state is a low plateau with an average elevation of about 400 metres (1,200&nbsp;ft), very low relief, and no [[surface runoff]]. This descends relatively sharply to the coastal plains, in some cases forming a sharp escarpment (as with the Darling Range/[[Darling Scarp]] near Perth).

[[File:WAHighways.png|thumb|right|Western Australian cities, towns, settlements and [[List of highways in Western Australia|road network]].]]

The extreme age of the landscape has meant that the soils are remarkably infertile and frequently [[laterite|laterised]]. Even soils derived from [[granite|granitic]] [[bedrock]] contain an order of magnitude less available [[phosphorus]] and only half as much [[nitrogen]] as soils in comparable climates in other continents. Soils derived from extensive sandplains or [[ironstone]] are even less fertile, nearly devoid of soluble phosphate and deficient in [[zinc]], copper, [[molybdenum]] and sometimes [[potassium]] and [[calcium]].

The infertility of most of the soils has required heavy application by farmers of fertilisers. These have resulted in damage to [[invertebrate]] and bacterial populations.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The grazing and use of hoofed mammals and, later, heavy machinery through the years have resulted in [[soil compaction|compaction of soils]] and great damage to the fragile soils.

Large-scale land clearing for agriculture has damaged habitats for native flora and fauna. As a result, the [[Southwest Australia|South West region]] of the state has a higher concentration of rare, threatened or endangered flora and fauna than many areas of Australia, making it one of the world's biodiversity "hot spots". Large areas of the state's wheatbelt region have problems with [[Soil salinity control|dryland salinity]] and the loss of fresh water.

===Climate===
[[File:Western Australia Köppen.svg|left|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] in Western Australia]]
The [[Southwest corner of Western Australia|southwest coastal area]] has a [[Mediterranean climate]]. It was originally heavily forested, including large stands of [[karri]], one of the [[List of tallest trees|tallest trees]] in the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=Climate of Western Australia |publisher=Bureau of Meteorology |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/ausclim/ausclimwa.htm |access-date=6 December 2009 |archive-url=https://webarchive.nla.gov.au/awa/20090317054300/http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/ausclim/ausclimwa.html |archive-date=17 March 2009}} {{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> This agricultural region is one of the nine most bio-diverse terrestrial habitats, with a higher proportion of [[endemic species]] than most other equivalent regions. Thanks to the offshore [[Leeuwin Current]], the area is one of the top six regions for marine biodiversity and contains the most southerly [[coral reef]]s in the world.

Average annual rainfall varies from 300 millimetres (12&nbsp;in) at the edge of the [[Wheatbelt (Western Australia)|Wheatbelt]] region to 1,400 millimetres (55&nbsp;in) in the wettest areas near [[Northcliffe, Western Australia|Northcliffe]], but from November to March, evaporation exceeds rainfall, and it is generally very dry. Plants are adapted to this as well as the extreme poverty of all soils.

The central two-thirds of the state is [[arid]] and sparsely inhabited. The only significant economic activity is mining. Annual rainfall averages less than 300 millimetres (8–10&nbsp;in), most of which occurs in sporadic torrential falls related to cyclone events in summer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/climate_averages/rainfall/index.jsp |title=Average annual, seasonal and monthly rainfall |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia, Bureau of Meteorology |date=26 October 2011 |access-date=1 June 2014 }}</ref>

An exception to this is the northern tropical regions. The [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] has an extremely hot [[Australian monsoon|monsoonal climate]] with average annual rainfall ranging from 500 to 1,500 millimetres (20–60&nbsp;in), but there is a very long almost rainless season from April to November. Eighty-five percent of the state's [[runoff (water)|runoff]] occurs in the Kimberley, but because it occurs in violent floods and because of the insurmountable poverty of the generally shallow soils, the only development has taken place along the [[Ord River]].

Snow is rare in the state and typically occurs only in the [[Stirling Range]] near [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]], as it is the only mountain range far enough south and sufficiently elevated. More rarely, snow can fall on the nearby [[Porongurup National Park|Porongurup Range]]. Snow outside these areas is a major event; it usually occurs in hilly areas of southwestern Australia.

[[File:RottnestQuokka.jpg|alt=|thumb|A [[quokka]] on [[Rottnest Island]]]]
[[File:Black Swans.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[black swan]] is the state bird of Western Australia]]
Western Australia is home to around [[List of Western Australian birds|630 species of birds]] (depending on the taxonomy used). Of these around 15 are [[endemic species|endemic]] to the state. The best areas for birds are the southwestern corner of the state and the area around Broome and the Kimberley.

The [[Flora of Western Australia]] comprises 10,162 published native [[vascular plant]] species, along with a further 1,196 species currently recognised but unpublished. They occur within 1,543 [[genus|genera]] from 211 [[Family (biology)|families]]; there are also 1,276 naturalised alien or [[invasive plant]] species, more commonly known as weeds.<ref>{{cite web|title=2016 Vascular Flora Statistics|publisher=Flora Base |url=https://florabase.dpaw.wa.gov.au/statistics/|access-date=3 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=New linear systematic sequence for vascular plants |publisher=Flora Base |url=https://florabase.dpaw.wa.gov.au/articles/sequence/sequence |access-date=3 June 2017|archive-date=15 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215190326/https://florabase.dpaw.wa.gov.au/articles/sequence/sequence}}</ref> In the southwest region are some of the largest numbers of plant species for its area in the world. 

Western Australia's [[ecoregion]]s include the sandstone gorges of [[Kimberley tropical savanna|the Kimberley]] on the northern coast, and below that the drier [[Victoria Plains tropical savanna]] inland, and the semi-desert [[Pilbara shrublands]], [[Carnarvon xeric shrublands]], and [[Western Australian mulga shrublands]] to the southwest. Southwards along the coast are the [[Southwest Australia savanna]] and the [[Swan Coastal Plain]] around Perth, with the [[Warren bioregion|jarrah-karri forest and shrublands]] on the southwest corner of the coast around the [[Margaret River]] wine-growing area. Going east along the Southern Ocean coast is the [[Goldfields-Esperance]] region, including the [[Esperance mallee]] and the [[Coolgardie woodlands]] inland around town of [[Coolgardie]]. Deserts occupy the interior, including the [[Great Sandy-Tanami desert]], [[Gibson Desert]], [[Great Victoria Desert]], and [[Nullarbor Plain]].

In 1831 Scottish botanist [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]] produced a scientific paper, ''[[General view of the botany of the vicinity of Swan River]]''. It discusses the vegetation of the [[Swan River Colony]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Diels, Ludwig |translator=Carr, D.

[[File:Western Australia population T.svg|upright|thumb|left|WA population growth 1829–2010]]

Europeans began to settle permanently in 1826 when [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] was claimed by Britain to forestall French claims to the western third of the continent. Perth was founded as the [[Swan River Colony]] in 1829 by British and Irish settlers, though the outpost languished. Its officials eventually requested [[Convictism in Australia|convict]] labour to augment its population. By the time [[Penal transportation|transportation]] ceased in 1868, convicts outnumbered free settlers 9,700 to 7,300.<ref name="nma23">{{cite web |title=Founding of Perth |date=2023-05-04 |website=National Museum of Australia, Government of Australia |url=https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/founding-of-perth |access-date=2024-06-16 |quote=Between 1850 and 1868 around 10,000 British convicts arrived at the colony. By 1868 the total population was 17,000, with convicts outnumbering settlers, 9700 to 7300. }}</ref> In the 1890s, interstate immigration, resulting from a mining boom in the [[Goldfields-Esperance|Goldfields region]], resulted in a sharp population increase.

Western Australia did not receive significant flows of [[Immigration to Australia|immigrants]] from Britain, Ireland or elsewhere in the [[British Empire]] until the early 20th century. At that time, its local projects—such as the [[Group Settlement Scheme]] of the 1920s, which encouraged farmers to settle the southwest—increased awareness of Australia's western third as a destination for colonists.

Led by immigrants from the British Isles, Western Australia's population developed at a faster rate during the twentieth century than it had previously. After [[World War II]], both the eastern states and Western Australia received large numbers of [[Italian Australian|Italians]], [[Croatian Australian|Croatians]] and [[Macedonian Australians|Macedonians]]. Despite this, Britain has contributed the greatest number of immigrants to this day. Western Australia—particularly Perth—has the highest proportion of British-born of any state: 10.3% in 2011, compared to a national average of 5.1%. This group is heavily concentrated in certain parts, where they account for a quarter of the population.<ref name=abs_2011>{{cite web|title=Country of Birth |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/3105.0.65.0012014?OpenDocument |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |access-date=27 October 2014|format=xls|date=1 October 2014}}</ref>

Western Australia's economy is largely driven by extraction and processing of a diverse range of mineral and petroleum commodities. The structure of the economy is closely linked to these natural resources, providing a comparative advantage in resource extraction and processing. As a consequence:

* Diversification (i.e. a greater ''range'' of commodities) over the past 15 years has provided a more balanced production base and less reliance on just a few major export markets, insulating the economy from fluctuations in world prices to some extent.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Tourism===
[[File:Broome Cable Beach and camels.jpg|thumb|Camel rides are a popular tourist activity at [[Cable Beach]] in [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]]]]
In recent years, tourism has grown in importance, with significant numbers of visitors to the state coming from the UK and Ireland (28%), other European countries (14%) Singapore (16%), Japan (10%) and Malaysia (8%).<ref name="WAatAglance" /> Revenue from tourism is a strong economic driver in many of the smaller population centres outside of Perth, especially in coastal locations.

Tourism forms a major part of the Western Australian economy with 833,100 international visitors making up 12.8% of the total international tourism to Australia in the year ending March 2015. The top three source markets include the United Kingdom (17%), Singapore (10%), and New Zealand (10%) with the majority of purpose for visitation being holiday/vacation reasons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tourism.wa.gov.au/Publications%20Library/Research%20and%20reports/Fast%20Facts%20YE%20March%202015.pdf|title=Tourism Western Australia : Fast Facts Year Ending March 2015|website=Tourism.wa.gov.au|access-date=17 February 2019|archive-date=4 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304043947/http://www.tourism.wa.gov.au/Publications%20Library/Research%20and%20reports/Fast%20Facts%20YE%20March%202015.pdf}}</ref> The tourism industry contributes $9.3&nbsp;billion to the Western Australian economy and supports 94,000 jobs within the state. Both directly and indirectly, the industry makes up 3.2% of the state's economy whilst comparatively, WA's largest revenue source, the mining sector, brings in 31%.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tourism Satellite Account : Western Australia 2013 – 2014 : Fact Sheet |url=http://www.tourism.wa.gov.au/Publications%20Library/Research%20and%20reports/TSA%202013-14%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |website=Tourism.wa.gov.au |access-date=17 February 2019|archive-date=4 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035910/http://www.tourism.wa.gov.au/Publications%20Library/Research%20and%20reports/TSA%202013-14%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf}}</ref>

==Government==
{{Main|Government of Western Australia}}
[[File:Parliament House, Perth, February 2022 01.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Parliament House, Perth|Parliament House]]|left]]
Western Australia was granted self-government in 1890<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Government of Western Australia|date=11 June 2015 |url=https://www.constitutionalcentre.wa.gov.au/ResearchAndSeminarPapers/LaunchingTheShip/Pages/ProclamationDay.aspx|title=Proclamation Day |access-date=21 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029211952/https://www.constitutionalcentre.wa.gov.au/ResearchAndSeminarPapers/LaunchingTheShip/Pages/ProclamationDay.aspx|archive-date=29 October 2017}}</ref> with a bicameral [[Parliament of Western Australia|Parliament]] located in Perth, consisting of the [[Western Australian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] (or ''lower house''), which has 59 members; and the [[Western Australian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] (or ''upper house''), which has 36 members. Suffrage is universal and compulsory for citizens over 18 years of age.

With the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901, Western Australia became a state within Australia's [[Federation|federal]] structure; this involved ceding certain powers to the Commonwealth (or Federal) government in accordance with the Constitution; all powers not specifically granted to the Commonwealth remained solely with the State. However over time the Commonwealth has effectively expanded its powers through broad interpretation of its enumerated powers and increasing control of taxation and financial distribution (see [[Federalism in Australia]]).

Whilst the sovereign of Western Australia is [[monarchy of Australia|the monarch of Australia]] (currently [[Charles III]]) and executive power is nominally vested in his or her state representative, the [[Governor of Western Australia|Governor]] (currently [[Chris Dawson (governor)|Chris Dawson]]), executive power rests with the premier and ministers drawn from the party or coalition of parties holding a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly. [[Roger Cook (politician)|Roger Cook]] is the premier, having succeeded [[Mark McGowan]] after his resignation in June 2023.

===Secession===
{{Main|Secessionism in Western Australia}}
[[File:Westralia secession movement meeting 1933.jpg|thumb|A 1933 meeting of the Dominion League in support of secession.]]
Secessionism has been a recurring feature of Western Australia's political landscape since shortly after European settlement in 1826. Western Australia was the most reluctant participant in the [[Federation of Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]].<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MULR/2000/40.html Review Essay, New Federation History, Melbourne University Law Review] www.austlii.edu.au</ref> Western Australia did not participate in the earliest federation conference. Longer-term residents of Western Australia were generally opposed to federation; however, the discovery of gold brought many immigrants from other parts of Australia. It was these residents, primarily in Kalgoorlie but also in Albany who voted to join the Commonwealth, and the proposal of these areas being admitted separately under the name [[Auralia]] was considered.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In a [[1933 Western Australian secession referendum|referendum in April 1933]], 68% of voters voted for the state to leave the Commonwealth of Australia with the aim of returning to the British Empire as an autonomous territory. The State Government sent a delegation to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]], but the British Government ruled that after the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], it no longer had the authority to amend the constitution of Australia without the consent of its federal government; the British Government took no action.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article30087998|title=25 May 1935 – W.

"West Australia" and its related demonym "West Australian" are occasionally used, including in the names of the main daily newspaper, ''[[The West Australian]]'', and the state-based [[West Australian Football League]], but are rarely used in an official sense. The terms "[[Westralia (disambiguation)|Westralia]]" and "Westralian" were regularly used in the 19th and 20th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://henrietta.liswa.wa.gov.au/search/?searchtype=X&SORT=D&searcharg=westralia&searchscope=2&submit.x=0&submit.y=0&submit=Submit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109143420/http://henrietta.liswa.wa.gov.au/search/?searchtype=X&SORT=D&searcharg=westralia&searchscope=2&submit.x=0&submit.y=0&submit=Submit |archive-date=9 November 2011 |title=SLWA Online Catalogue /Entire Sta |website=Henrietta.liswa.wa.gov.au |access-date=2 November 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/result?q=westralia|title=Search results for 'westralia' – Trove|website=Trove.nla.gov.au|access-date=16 September 2015}}</ref> The terms are still found in the names of certain companies and buildings, e.g. Westralia House in Perth, the [[skyscraper]] Westralia Square on [[St Georges Terrace]], and Westralia Airports Corporation, which operates [[Perth Airport]], as well as in the names of several ships.<ref>{{cite web |title=SLWA Online Catalogue /Entire Sta |url=http://henrietta.liswa.wa.gov.au/record=b2140613~S2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109135900/http://henrietta.liswa.wa.gov.au/record=b2140613~S2 |archive-date=9 November 2011 |website=Henrietta.liswa.wa.gov.au |access-date=2 November 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=SLWA Online Catalogue /Entire Sta |url=http://henrietta.liswa.wa.gov.au/record=b1791098~S2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109141500/http://henrietta.liswa.wa.gov.au/record=b1791098~S2 |archive-date=9 November 2011 |website=Henrietta.liswa.wa.gov.au |access-date=2 November 2012 }}</ref>
