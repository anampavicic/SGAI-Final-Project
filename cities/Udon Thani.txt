'''Udon Thani''' ({{langx|th|อุดรธานี}}, {{IPA|th|ʔù.dɔ̄ːn tʰāː.nīː|pron}}) is a city in [[Isan]] ([[Isan|Northeast Thailand]]), the capital of [[Udon Thani Province]] and the sixth largest city in [[Thailand]]. The city municipality (''thesaban nakhon'' / [[city proper]]) had a population of 130,531 people as of 2019, while Udon Thani's urban area, [[Mueang Udon Thani district|Mueang Udon Thani]], has a population of approximately 400,000. 
Udon Thani is one of four major cities in Isan, the others being [[Nakhon Ratchasima]], [[Ubon Ratchathani]], and [[Khon Kaen]]. Together they are known as the "big four of Isan".

==Location==
Udon is approximately 560&nbsp;km from [[Bangkok]]. It is a major official and commercial center in northern [[Isan]], Thailand, and the gateway to [[Laos]], [[northern Vietnam]], and [[northern and southern China|southern China]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Udon Thani|url=http://www.tourismthailand.org/Where-to-Go/Udon-Thani|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623140850/http://www.tourismthailand.org/Where-to-Go/Udon-Thani|url-status = dead|archive-date=23 June 2012|website=Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT)|access-date=22 August 2015}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Terminal building, Udon Thani International Airport (31-07-2005).jpg|thumb|right|[[Udon Thani International Airport]]]]
The city's economy was boosted by the proximity to [[Udon Thani International Airport|Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base]] during the [[Vietnam War]] and retains reminders of that time in the form of bars, coffee shops, and hotels. "Udon sort of became like [[Pattaya]] when the [[G.I. (military)|GIs]] arrived," said a local architect.<ref name=TIR-20190622>{{cite news |title=Recollections of Camp Ramasun: Life with Udon Thani GIs |url=https://isaanrecord.com/2019/06/22/recollections-camp-ramasun-udon-thani-gis/ |access-date=20 May 2020 |work=The Isaan Record |date=22 June 2019}}</ref> "Restaurants serving Western cuisine, hotels and nightclubs sprouted up everywhere to meet their needs.

The BBC has reported that [[Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base|Udon Thani's Royal Air Force Base]] was the site of a CIA [[black site]], known to insiders as "Detention Site Green", used to interrogate [[Abu Zubaydah]], Saudi-born Palestinian, believed to be one of [[Osama bin Laden]]'s top lieutenants. In December 2014 the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] (SSCI) published an executive summary of a secret 6,000-page report on CIA techniques. The report alleges that at least eight Thai senior officials knew of the secret site. The site was closed in December 2002.<ref name="BBC-20180504">{{cite news|title=CIA director Gina Haspel's Thailand torture ties|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43496212|access-date=15 May 2018|work=BBC News|date=2018-05-04}}</ref>
