'''Kent''' is a city in [[King County, Washington|King County]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], United States. It is part of the [[Seattle metropolitan area|Seattle–Tacoma–Bellevue metropolitan area]] and had a population of 136,588 as of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]],<ref name="2020 Census (City)">{{cite web|title=Explore Census Data |url=https://data.census.gov/profile/Kent_city,_Washington?g=160XX00US5335415 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=November 1, 2023}}</ref> making it the 4th most populous municipality in greater Seattle and the [[List of municipalities in Washington|6th most populous]] in Washington state. The city is connected to [[Seattle]], [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]] and [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] via [[Washington State Route 167|State Route 167]] and [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]], [[Sounder commuter rail]], and commuter buses.

Incorporated in 1890, Kent is the second-oldest incorporated city in the county, after the county seat of Seattle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kent is incorporated on May 28, 1890|url=http://historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=1666|website=historylink.org|publisher=History Ink|access-date=July 29, 2015}}</ref> It is generally divided into three areas: West Hill (mixed residential and commercial along Interstate 5), Valley (primarily industrial and commercial with some medium-density residential; significant parkland along [[Green River (Duwamish River tributary)|Green River]]), and [[East Hill-Meridian|East Hill]] (primarily residential with retail).

==History==
The Kent area was first permanently settled by European Americans in the 1850s along the banks of what was then the [[White River (Washington)|White River]]. The first settler was Samuel Russell, who sailed the White and [[Duwamish River|Duwamish]] rivers until he claimed a plot of land southeast of modern-day downtown Kent in the spring of 1853. Russell was followed by several other settlers who quickly staked claims around the area.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Florence K. Lentz; pictorial research by Linda Van Nest; "Partners in progress" by Lynn|title=Kent—valley of opportunity : an illustrated history|date=1990|publisher=Windsor Publications|location=Chatsworth, Calif.|isbn=0-89781-356-1|page=14|edition=1st}}</ref> The settlements were originally known as "White River" and later the town was called "Titusville" after an early settler by the name of James Henry Titus.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kent and the White River Valley Area|url=https://www.sos.wa.gov/legacy/cities_detail.aspx?i=7|website=Washington Secretary of State|access-date=September 18, 2017}}</ref> (There is still a "Titusville Station" sign on Gowe Street near First Avenue). In 1861 a post office was established under the name White River and was located at the farm of David and Irena Neely who settled in modern-day Kent in 1854. In 1855 their farm was [[Battle of Seattle (1856)#Prelude|attacked by Native Americans]] when David Neely served as a lieutenant in the Territorial Army. Another settler was [[Henry Yesler|Henry L. Yesler]], who was the first sawmill operator in Seattle.<ref name="WR">{{cite web |title=Kent and the White River Valley Area |url=https://www.sos.wa.gov/legacy/cities_detail.aspx?i=7 |publisher=Washington Secretary of State |access-date=June 23, 2020}}</ref> By 1870 the population was 277 and all of the quality bottom-land had been claimed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Florence K.

Throughout the 1860s and 70's, grain and forage crops such as wheat, barley, oats, hay, and timothy accounted for much of the annual return of farmers in the valley. During the late 1870s the town discovered [[hops]] production as a major source of income.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Florence K. Lentz; pictorial research by Linda Van Nest; "Partners in progress" by Lynn|title=Kent—valley of opportunity : an illustrated history|date=1990|publisher=Windsor Publications|location=Chatsworth, California|isbn=0-89781-356-1|page=20|edition=1st}}</ref> Due to an [[aphid]] invasion which affected hops crops in Europe,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smr.herefordshire.gov.uk/agriculture%20_industry/hops_history.htm |title=Herefordshire Through Time - Welcome |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |access-date=July 12, 2011}}</ref> hops from the [[Puget Sound]] area began to command high prices. Hops were shipped from Titusville either by the river or via rail. In 1889 the town was renamed for [[Kent|the County of Kent]], the major hops-producing region in England. [[Ezra Meeker]] was asked by the Northern Pacific Railroad to name its station. Meeker suggested that it be known as Kent as it was "Hop Capitol of the West".<ref name="WR"/> Hops production in the White River valley came to an end soon after its own invasion of aphids in 1891.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stein |first=Alan J. |url=http://historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=3587 |title=the Free Online Encyclopedia of Washington State History |publisher=HistoryLink.org |date=September 24, 2001|access-date=July 12, 2011}}</ref>

Kent was officially incorporated on May 28, 1890, with a population of 793, the second city incorporated in King County (after Seattle).<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilma|first=David|url=http://historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=1666|title=the Free Online Encyclopedia of Washington State History|publisher=HistoryLink.org|date=September 14, 1999|access-date=July 12, 2011}}</ref>

After the turn of the 20th century the area turned to [[dairy farming]] and was home to a [[Carnation (brand)|Carnation]] condensed milk plant.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lange |first=Greg |url=http://historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=1114 |title=the Free Online Encyclopedia of Washington State History |publisher=HistoryLink.org |date=May 9, 1999 |access-date=July 12, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Long |first=Priscilla |url=http://historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=1608 |title=the Free Online Encyclopedia of Washington State History |publisher=HistoryLink.org |date=August 6, 1999 |access-date=July 12, 2011}}</ref> Flooding from both the [[Green River (Duwamish River)|Green]] and the [[White River (Washington)|White]] Rivers was a constant problem. In 1906, flooding changed the course of the White River, which reduced the flood hazard by half. The Green River continued to present problems until the creation of the [[Howard A. Hanson Dam]] at Eagle Gorge in 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kent.k12.wa.us/curriculum/vtours/kent/|title=The History of Kent, Washington|access-date=January 27, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923092832/http://www.kent.k12.wa.us/curriculum/vtours/kent/|archive-date=September 23, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrvmuseum.org/|title= Welcome to our Home Page|publisher= White River Valley Museum|access-date=July 12, 2011}}</ref>

The city is governed by a [[mayor–council government]], with a directly elected mayor and a seven-member [[city council]]. Each is elected [[at-large]] (that is, by the entire voting population, rather than by districts) to four-year terms. The current mayor is Dana Ralph.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kentwa.gov/city-hall/kent-mayor|title=Kent Mayor Dana Ralph {{!}} City of Kent|website=www.kentwa.gov|access-date=April 7, 2019|archive-date=October 16, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201016161253/https://www.kentwa.gov/city-hall/kent-mayor|url-status=dead}}</ref> The city maintains its own municipal police department, unlike some neighboring municipalities who contract police service out to King County.
