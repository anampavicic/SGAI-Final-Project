'''Bergamo''' ({{IPA|it|ˈbɛrɡamo|lang|It-Bergamo.ogg}}; {{langx|lmo|label=[[Bergamasque dialect|Bergamasque]]|Bèrghem}} {{IPA-lmo|ˈbɛrɡɛm||Bèrghem.ogg}}) is a city in the [[Alps|alpine]] [[Lombardy]] region of [[northern Italy]], approximately {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Milan]], and about {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} from the [[alpine lake]]s [[Lake Como|Como]] and [[Lake Iseo|Iseo]] and 70&nbsp;km (43&nbsp;mi) from [[Lake Garda|Garda]] and [[Lake Maggiore|Maggiore]]. The [[Bergamo Alps]] ({{lang|it|Alpi Orobie}}) begin immediately north of the city. 

With a population of around 120,000, Bergamo is the fourth-largest city in Lombardy. Bergamo is the seat of the [[province of Bergamo]], which counts over 1,103,000 residents (2020). The [[metropolitan area]] of Bergamo extends beyond the administrative city limits, spanning over a densely urbanized area with slightly less than 500,000 inhabitants.<ref name="UrbanismiInItalia">{{cite web |url=http://www.cityrailways.it/storage/pdf/01_urbanismi%20ITALIA_2011.pdf|title=Urbanismi in Italia, 2011 |website=cityrailways.it |language=Italian |trans-title=|access-date=4 November 2014}}</ref> The Bergamo metropolitan area is itself part of the broader [[Milan metropolitan area]], home to over 8 million people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecdbookshop.org/oecd/get-it.asp?REF=0406051E.PDF&TYPE=browse|title=OECD Territorial Review - Milan, Italy}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://urbact.eu/fileadmin/subsites/Metrogov/pdf/Milan_s2.pdf |title=Competitiveness and knowledge transfer |access-date=2015-03-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205140422/http://urbact.eu/fileadmin/subsites/Metrogov/pdf/Milan_s2.pdf |archive-date=5 December 2008 }} Competitiveness of Milan and its metropolitan area</ref><ref>[http://demo.istat.it/bilmens2013gen/index.html ISTAT]</ref>

The city of Bergamo is composed of an old walled core, known as {{lang|it|Città Alta}} ('Upper Town'), nestled within a [[Parco dei Colli di Bergamo|system of hills]], and the modern expansion in the plains below. The upper town is encircled by massive [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[Venetian Works of Defence between 15th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra – western Stato da Mar|defensive systems]] that are a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] since 9 July 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/331/|title=The city of Bergamo - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-02}}</ref> 

Bergamo is well connected to several cities in Italy, thanks to the [[autostrada A4|motorway A4]] stretching on the axis between Milan, [[Verona]], and [[Venice]]. The city is served by [[Il Caravaggio International Airport]], the third-busiest airport in Italy with 12.3 million passengers in 2017. Bergamo is the second most visited city in Lombardy after Milan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asr-lombardia.it/RSY/tourism/flows-of-tourists/lombardia-and-provinces/tables/12193/2012/|title=RSY Lombardia-Arrivals and nights spent by guests in accommodation establishments, by type of resort and by type of establishment.

==Toponymy==
In [[classical Latin]], the toponym is attested as ''Bergomum'', while in [[late Latin]] ''Bergame''. The toponym in the local [[Bergamasque dialect]] of the Lombard language is instead ''Bèrghem''. There are various hypotheses put forward to trace the origin of the name of the city.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2013-11-03 |title=L'ETIMOLOGIA DI BERGAMO |url=https://rinabrundu.com/2013/11/03/letimologia-di-bergamo/ |access-date=2023-03-18 |website=LA BARBA DI DIOGENE |language=en}}</ref>

Local historian and politician [[Bortolo Belotti]] compared the toponym to previous [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] and pre-Celtic names, of which ''Bergomum'' would then only be the Latinisation; the word ''berg'' in Celtic means a protection, fortification or abode.  In the writings of early Roman period, the toponym ''Bergomum'' appears to be associated with ''Bergimus'', the Celtic god of mountains or dwellings.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mommsen |first=Theodor |title=Corpus inscriptionum Latinarum |page=548}}</ref> 

Historian Antonio Tiraboschi argued instead that the toponym stemmed from the [[Proto-Germanic language]]. The Bergamo toponym is similar to toponyms in various Germanic-speaking areas, and might be associated with *''berg +*heim'', or the "mountain home".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comune.bergamo.it/servizi/Menu/dinamica.aspx?idSezione=3786&idArea=1181&idCat=1190&ID=1471&TipoElemento=pagina|title=Comune di Bergamo (BG)|website=comune.bergamo.it|access-date=2018-08-15|archive-date=3 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503020058/http://www.comune.bergamo.it/servizi/Menu/dinamica.aspx?idSezione=3786&idArea=1181&idCat=1190&ID=1471&TipoElemento=pagina}}</ref> The hypothesis of a Germanic derivation clashes however with the absence of documents regarding Germanic settlements in the area prior to the settlement of the [[Lombards]] who settled in the northern part of the Italian peninsula after the collapse of the Roman Empire.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cosa vedere {{!}} AEGEE-Bergamo |url=https://www.aegeebergamo.eu/it/i-love-bergamo/cosa-vedere/ |access-date=2023-03-18 |language=it-IT}}</ref>[[File:Città-alta.jpg|thumb|425x425px|The Città Alta]]

===Antiquity===
Bergomum (as it was known in classical Latin) was first settled by the [[Ligures|Ligurian]] tribe of the [[Orobii]], during the Iron Age period.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Orobi nell'Enciclopedia Treccani |url=https://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/orobi |access-date=2023-03-18 |website=www.treccani.it |language=it-IT}}</ref> During the [[Celts|Celtic]] invasion of [[northern Italy]], around the year of 550 BC, the city was conquered by the [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribe]] of [[Cenomani (Cisalpine Gaul)|Cenomani]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Battista Rota |first=Giovanni |title=Dell'origine e della storia antica di Bergamo |page=55 |language=it}}</ref> 

In 49 BCE, it became a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] municipality, containing {{circa|10,000}} inhabitants at its peak.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bergamo |first=Visit |title=LA BERGAMO ROMANA • • Visit Bergamo |url=https://www.visitbergamo.net/es/object-details/8149-la-bergamo-romana/ |access-date=2023-03-18 |website=visitbergamo.net |language=es}}</ref> An important hub on the military road between [[Friuli]] and [[Raetia]], it was destroyed by [[Attila the Hun|Attila]] in the 5th century.

===Middle Ages===
{{See also|Rule of the Dukes|Kingdom of the Lombards|List of kings of the Lombards}}From the 6th century, Bergamo was the seat of one of the most important [[Lombards|Lombard]] duchies of northern Italy, together with [[Brescia]], [[Trento]], and [[Cividale del Friuli]]: its first [[Duke (Lombard)|Lombard duke]] was [[Wallaris]].{{cn|date=November 2022}}

After the conquest of the Lombard Kingdom by [[Charlemagne]], it became the seat of a county under one [[Auteramus]] (died&thinsp;816). An important Lombardic [[Bergamo Treasure|hoard]] dating from the 6th to 7th centuries was found in the vicinity of the city in the 19th century and is now in the [[British Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=37534&plaA=37534-3-1|title=Collection search: You searched for|website=British Museum}}</ref>

From the 11th century onwards, Bergamo was an independent [[Italian communes|commune]], taking part in the [[Lombard League]] which defeated [[Frederick I Barbarossa]] in 1165. The local [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph and Ghibelline]] factions were the [[Colleoni]] and [[Suardi (dynasty)|Suardi]], respectively.{{cn|date=November 2022}}

Feuding between the two initially caused the family of [[Omodeo Tasso]] to flee north {{circa|1250}}, but he returned to Bergamo in the later 13th century to organize the city's couriers: this would eventually lead to the [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] [[Thurn und Taxis]] dynasty generally credited with organizing the [[Kaiserliche Reichspost|first modern postal service]].{{cn|date=November 2022}}

===Early modern===
After a short period under the [[House of Malatesta]] starting from 1407, Bergamo was ceded in 1428 by the [[Duchy of Milan]] to the [[Republic of Venice]] in the context of the [[Wars in Lombardy]] and the aftermath of the 1427 [[Battle of Maclodio]].

Despite the brief interlude granted by the [[Treaty of Lodi]] in 1454, the uneasy [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] among the northern Italian states precipitated the [[Italian Wars]], a series of conflicts from 1494 to 1559 that involved, at various times, also the [[Papal States]], [[Early modern France|France]], and the [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref>Michael Mallett and Christine Shaw, ''The Italian Wars: 1494–1559''. Harlow: Pearson Education Limited, 2012.</ref>

The wars, which were both a result and cause of Venetian involvement in the power politics of mainland Italy, prompted [[Republic of Venice| Venice]] to assert its direct rule over its [[Domini di Terraferma|mainland domains]].

As much of the fighting during the Italian Wars took place during sieges, increasing levels of fortification were adopted, using such new developments as detached bastions that could withstand sustained artillery fire.<ref>Max Boot, ''War Made New: Technology, Warfare, and the Course of History, 1500 to Today''. New York: Penguin Group, 2006.</ref>

The [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] (17 October 1797) formally recognized the inclusion of Bergamo and other parts of northern Italy into the [[Cisalpine Republic]], a [[Sister Republic|"sister republic"]] of the [[French First Republic]] that was superseded in 1802 by the short-lived [[Italian Republic (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic Italian Republic]] and in 1805 by the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]].

===Late modern and contemporary===
At the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]], Bergamo was assigned to the [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia]], a [[crown land]] of the [[Austrian Empire]]. The visit of [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]] in 1838 coincided with the opening of the new boulevard stretching into the plains, leading to the railway station that was inaugurated in 1857. Austrian rule was at first welcomed, but later challenged by [[Five Days of Milan|Italian independentist insurrections]] in 1848.{{cn|date=November 2022}}

[[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] conquered Bergamo in 1859, during the [[Second Italian War of Independence]]. As a result, the city was incorporated into the newly founded [[Kingdom of Italy]].{{cn|date=November 2022}}

For its contribution to the [[Italian unification]] movement, Bergamo is also known as ''Città dei Mille'' ('City of the Thousand'), because a significant part of the rank-and-file supporting Giuseppe Garibaldi in his expedition against the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] came from Bergamo and its environs.
[[File:Cloudy day in Bergamo, view from Airport parking - panoramio.jpg|thumb|510x510px|Bergamo Upper Town and [[Bergamasque Alps|Alpi Orobie]] from the airport]]
During the twentieth century, Bergamo became one of Italy's most industrialized areas.

In 1907, [[Marcello Piacentini]] devised a new [[Comprehensive planning|urban master plan]] that was implemented between 1912 and 1927, in a style reminiscent of [[Novecento Italiano]] and [[Rationalism (architecture)|Modernist Rationalism]].{{cn|date=November 2022}}

The 2017 [[43rd G7 summit]] on agriculture was held in Bergamo, in the context of the broader international meeting organized in [[Taormina]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://milano.repubblica.it/cronaca/2017/10/15/news/g7_agricoltura_bergamo-178352010/|title=G7 Agricoltura, approvata la Carta di Bergamo: "Zero fame entro il 2030"|date=2017-10-15|work=Repubblica.it|access-date=2017-10-16|language=it}}</ref>

The "Charter of Bergamo" is an international commitment, signed during the summit, to reduce hunger worldwide by 2030, strengthen cooperation for agricultural development in Africa, and ensure price transparency.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bergamonews.it/2017/10/15/g7-nasce-la-carta-bergamo-cooperazione-trasparenza-sui-prezzi-lotta-allo-spreco-alimentare/267082/|title=G7, nasce la Carta di Bergamo: cooperazione, trasparenza sui prezzi e lotta allo spreco alimentare|date=2017-10-15|work=BergamoNews|access-date=2017-10-16|language=it-IT}}</ref>

In early 2020, during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Italy]], Bergamo's healthcare system was overwhelmed by patients with [[COVID-19]]. There were reports of doctors confronted with ethical dilemmas with too few ICU beds and mechanical ventilation systems.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-italy-ethics-speci-idUSKBN2133KG|title=Special Report: 'All is well'.

[[File:Bergamo Alta Panoramic View.jpg|thumb|260px|Lower City seen from Upper City]]
[[File:Legenda MuraVeneteBG.svg|thumb|250px|Walled city scheme]]
The town has two centres: ''Città Alta'' ('Upper City'), a hilltop medieval town, surrounded by 16th-century defensive walls, and the ''Città Bassa'' ('Lower City'). The two parts of the town are connected by [[funicular]], roads, and footpaths.

===Upper city===

Walking along the narrow medieval streets, you can visit numerous places of interest including:
*''[[Visconti Citadel (Bergamo)|Cittadella]]'' (Citadel), built under the rule of the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]] in the mid-14th century.
*''Piazza Vecchia''
*''Palazzo della Ragione''. This was the seat of the administration of the city in the medieval municipal period. Built in the [[Timeline of architecture#12th century|12th century]], it was revamped in the [[Timeline of architecture#16th century|late 16th century]] by Pietro Isabello. The façade has the [[Lion of Saint Mark]] over a mullioned window, testifying to the long period of Venetian rule. The atrium has a well-preserved 18th-century [[sundial]].
*''Palazzo Nuovo'' ([[Biblioteca Civica Angelo Mai]]). It was designed by [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] in the early 17th century and completed in 1928.
*[[Santa Maria Maggiore, Bergamo|Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]]. It was built [[1130s in architecture|from 1137]] on the site of a previous religious edifice of the 7th century. Construction continued until [[Timeline of architecture#15th century|the 15th century]]. Of this first building the external Romanesque structure and the Greek cross plan remain.  The interior was extensively modified in the 16th and 17th centuries. Noteworthy are the great Crucifix and the tomb of [[Gaetano Donizetti]].
*''[[Cappella Colleoni]]'', annexed to Santa Maria Maggiore, is a masterwork of [[Renaissance architecture]] and [[Decorative arts|decorative art]]. It contains the tomb of [[Bartolomeo Colleoni]].
*''Battistero'' (Baptistry), an elegant octagonal building dating from 1340.
*[[Bergamo Cathedral]]. It was built in the late 17th century with later modifications.
*''Rocca''. It was begun in 1331 on the hill of Sant'Eufemia by William of Castelbarco, vicar of [[John of Bohemia]], and later completed by [[Azzone Visconti]]. A wider citadel was added, but is now partly lost.
*''San Michele al Pozzo Bianco''. Built in the 12th century, this church contains several frescoes from the 12th to the 16th centuries, including paintings by [[Lorenzo Lotto]].

===Lower city===
[[File:Vista dalle Mura .... - panoramio.jpg|thumb|260px|Bergamo Upper City, Lower City and Bergamo Hills]]
The lower city is the modern centre of Bergamo. At the end of the 19th century, ''Città Bassa'' was composed of residential neighborhoods built along the main roads that linked Bergamo to the other cities of Lombardy. The main boroughs were [[Borgo Palazzo]] along the road to [[Brescia]], [[Borgo San Leonardo]] along the road to [[Milan]] and [[Borgo Santa Caterina]] along the road to [[Serio (river)|Serio Valley]]. Borgo Santa Caterina is one of {{Lang|it|[[I Borghi più belli d'Italia]]}} ('The most beautiful villages of Italy').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://borghipiubelliditalia.it/lombardia/|title=Lombardia|access-date=31 July 2023|language=it}}</ref>

The city rapidly expanded during the 20th century. In the first decades, the municipality erected major buildings such as the new courthouse and various administrative offices in the lower part of Bergamo in order to create a new city center. After [[World War II]], many residential buildings were constructed in the lower part of the city which are now divided into twenty-five neighborhoods:
