'''Hagen''' ({{IPA|de|ˈhaːɡn̩|-|De-Hagen.ogg}}) is a city in the [[States of Germany|state]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]], on the southeastern edge of the [[Ruhr area]], 15&nbsp;km south of [[Dortmund]], where the rivers [[Lenne]] and [[Volme]] meet the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]]. In 2023, the population was 197,677.

The city is home to the [[FernUniversität Hagen]] (University of Hagen), the only state-funded [[distance education]] university in Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/universitaet/zahlen.shtml|title=Zahlen und Daten|access-date=12 December 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Studierende an Hochschulen – Fachserie 11 Reihe 4.1 – Wintersemester 2021/2022 (Letzte Ausgabe – berichtsweise eingestellt)|url=https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bildung-Forschung-Kultur/Hochschulen/Publikationen/Downloads-Hochschulen/studierende-hochschulen-endg-2110410227004.pdf?__blob=publicationFile |page=34|accessdate=12 December 2022}}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:Hengsteysee Panorama.jpg|thumb|left|{{Lang|de|[[Hengsteysee]]}}]]The largest extension of Hagen's municipal area is 17.1 km in a north-south direction and 15.5 km in a west-east direction. The city boundary of 89.7 km is made up of 3.3 km to Dortmund, 9 km to the [[Unna (district)|district of Unna]], 56.6 km to the [[Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis|Ennepe-Ruhr district]] and 20.8 km to the [[Märkischer Kreis|Märkisch district]]. The area of the city (160.36 km²) is roughly the size of the [[Liechtenstein|Principality of Liechtenstein]].

42 per cent of Hagen's municipal area consists of forest.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Statistische Berichte Bodenflächen in Nordrhein-Westfalen nach Art der tatsächlichen Nutzung, Ausgabe 2015 Ergebnisse der Flächenerhebung am 31. Dezember 2014 |url=https://webshop.it.nrw.de/gratis/C179%20201500.pdf}}</ref> The four rivers in Hagen stretch over a length of 52.2 km: [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] 11.5 km, [[Lenne]] 13.1 km, [[Volme]] 21.3 km and [[Ennepe]] 6.3 km. The difference in altitude from the lowest point on the Ruhr near Vorhalle (86 metres above sea level) to the highest point east of Bölling ♁51° 18′ N, 7° 34′ E (438 metres above sea level) is 352 metres.

=== Geology and palaeontology ===
Since the early 19th century, the Hagen area has been regarded as a classic discovery region for [[Paleontology|palaeontology]] and [[archaeology]]

There are various rocks and deposits from the [[Devonian]] to the [[Carboniferous]] in the municipal area. Marine and terrestrial deposits from the [[Cretaceous]], [[Tertiary]] and [[Holocene]] periods have been preserved in [[Solutional cave|karst caves]] in the [[Limestone|mass limestone]].

Other fossil sites with animal and plant remains from the [[Paleozoic|Palaeozoic]] to the [[Mesozoic]] have also made important contributions to geoscientific research. In the area around Hagen, for example, the bones of land dinosaurs and early mammals as well as plant remains from the Lower Cretaceous period were found.

The former Hagen-Vorhalle brickworks quarry is considered an important site for the discovery of fossilised insects and other fossils, including early large dragonflies with wingspans of 40 cm, extinct primordial web-footed butterflies and giant centipedes and millipedes from the Upper Carboniferous period. The Hagen-Vorhalle quarry is considered a geotope of global importance for palaeontological research. Finds from the quarry and from the entire region can be seen in the Museum of Prehistory and Early History in Werdringen moated castle.

In a side valley of the Lenne near Holthausen, the remains of Stone Age people were discovered in the ‘Blätterhöhle’ cave. With a C14 age of up to 11,300 years, they date from the beginning of the Mesolithic period. This makes them the oldest evidence to date of anatomically modern humans in the post-glacial period on the European continent.

==History==

=== Medieval times ===
[[File:Ruine Hohensyburg mit Vinketurm.JPG|left|thumb|The ruins of [[Sigiburg|Syburg]]]]
The Hagen region first appears in historical records in the [[Annales laureshamenses|Lorsch Annals]] ({{langx|la|Annales Laureshamenses}}): In 775, [[Charlemagne]]'s troops conquered the Saxon Hohensyburg (then called {{Lang|goh|Sigiburg}}) castle located near the city limits of Dortmund above the Ruhr-Lenne estuary.

Hagen itself was first mentioned around the year 1200, and is presumed to have been the name of a farm at the confluence of the Volme and the Ennepe rivers. After the conquest of {{ill|Burg Volmarstein|de}} in 1324, Hagen passed to the [[County of Mark]]. 

=== Early modern period ===
After the [[Treaty of Xanten]] in 1614, it was granted to the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], which became part of the newly founded [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1701.

A major fire destroyed a significant part of Hagen's buildings in 1724. With the help of the Prussian state administration, Hagen was rebuilt within a short time.

Hagen was granted [[town privileges]] on 3 September 1746.

=== 19th and early 20th Century ===
After the defeat of Prussia in the [[Fourth Coalition]], Hagen was incorporated into the [[Grand Duchy of Berg]] founded by [[First French Empire|France]] from 1807 to 1813. It became part of the new [[Province of Westphalia|Prussian province of Westphalia]] after the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815.

From 1817, Hagen was the seat of an office and a district within the administrative district of Arnsberg. In 1837, the revised town regulations and a magistrate were introduced. 

In the course of industrialisation, Hagen was connected to the network of the [[Bergisch-Markisch Railway Company|Bergisch-Märkische Eisenbahngesellschaft]] in 1848 and developed into an important railway junction.

By 1865, Hagen had overtaken Iserlohn, which had previously been the leading town in South Westphalia in terms of population and economic power.
[[File:1912 Hagen Mittelstraße.jpg|left|thumb|Mittelstraße, 1912]]
During the [[German Empire]] from 1871 to 1914, Hagen experienced a period of prosperity. Through urbanisation and industrialisation of the 19th century, the city developed into the main centre for the entire region south of the river [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]]. In 1887, Hagen was administratively separated from the district of Hagen and became an independent city ([[urban districts of Germany|urban district]]).

In the years following the turn of the century, the banker and patron Karl Ernst Osthaus brought many later important architects to the city, including [[Henry van de Velde]], [[Peter Behrens]] and [[Walter Gropius]]. They established Hagen's reputation as a link between [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Modern architecture|Modernism]] ({{Lang|de|Hagener Impul}}). The centrepiece of this initiative was the [[Museum Folkwang|Folkwang Museum]] and the (only partially built) garden city of Hohenhagen ({{Lang|de|Gartenstadt Hohenhagen}}).

In the [[Ruhr uprising]] of 13 March&nbsp;&ndash; 2 April 1920, the 50,000-man [[Ruhr Red Army]] took control of the industrial district. Government and paramilitary forces were ordered against the workers, suppressing the uprising, and killing an estimated 1,000 workers.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Anja |first=Wulfert |date=22 January 2002 |title=Der Märzaufstand 1920 |trans-title=The March Uprising 1920 |url=https://www.dhm.de/lemo/kapitel/weimarer-republik/innenpolitik/maerzaufstand-1920.html |access-date=3 April 2024 |website=Deutsches Historisches Museum |language=de}}</ref> A memorial to the uprising was installed in Hagen.

By 1928, Hagen had developed into a city of more than 100,000 inhabitants.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== During the nazi regime ===
During [[World War II]], Hagen was bombed repeatedly, by both the [[Royal Air Force]] and the United States [[Eighth Air Force#World War II .281944.E2.80.931945.29|Eighth Air Force]]. On the night of 1 October 1943, 243 [[Avro Lancaster|Lancasters]] and 8 [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquitoes]] from the [[Royal Air Force]]'s [[Bomber Command]] attacked the city. According to the Bomber Command Campaign Diary, "This raid was a complete success achieved on a completely cloud-covered target of small size, with only a moderate bomber effort and at trifling cost."{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}  Hagen sustained severe damage from that raid, and hundreds of [[German casualties in World War II#Air raid deaths|civilians were killed]]. After the war, the city centre was almost completely destroyed, so that only the surrounding districts still partially reflect the city's [[Gründerzeit|Wilhelminian architectural character]]. 

The victims of the Second World War and National Socialism in Hagen: more than 2,200 people died in Allied bombing raids between 1940 and 1945. Over 10,000 Hagen citizens died on the various fronts of the Second World War. Dozens of Hagen citizens were murdered in concentration camps and prisons for racial, religious, ideological and political reasons.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-11-18 |title=Historische Museen und Archive der Stadt Hagen: Ruhrkessel |url=http://www.historisches-centrum.de/index.php?id=295 |access-date=2024-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201118011621/http://www.historisches-centrum.de/index.php?id=295 |archive-date=2020-11-18 }}</ref>

In August 2021, discovery of a cache of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] artifacts from a house was announced. A history teacher revealed a painted portrait of [[Adolf Hitler]] and medals decorated with eagles and [[swastika]]s, a newspaper from 1945, a pistol, [[gas mask]]s, [[brass knuckles]], and stacks of documents. It is also found out that the house once served as the [[headquarters]] of the [[National Socialist People's Welfare|Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Solomon |first=Tessa |date=2021-08-13 |title=German History Teacher Uncovers Secret Cache of Nazi Artifacts Behind Wall |url=https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/german-history-teacher-uncovers-secret-cache-of-nazi-artifacts-behind-wall-1234601575/ |access-date=2021-09-08 |website=ARTnews.com |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Barrett |first=Claire |date=2021-08-12 |title=German History Teacher Finds Secret Cache of Nazi Artifacts in Family Home |url=https://www.historynet.com/german-history-teacher-finds-secret-cache-of-nazi-artifacts-in-family-home.htm |access-date=2021-09-08 |website=HistoryNet |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-08-02 |title=Nazi-Fund in Hagen: Neue Details kommen ans Licht |url=https://www.wp.de/staedte/hagen/nazi-fund-in-hagen-neue-details-kommen-ans-licht-id232948455.html |access-date=2021-09-08 |website=www.wp.de |language=de-DE}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-08-16 |title=A Schoolteacher in Germany Hit Upon a Trove of Lost Nazi Artifacts Hidden in a Wall More Than 75 Years Ago |url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/history-teacher-discovers-hidden-nazi-artifacts-1999220 |access-date=2021-09-08 |website=Artnet News |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Post-war period ===
In April 1945, the US Army liberated the city, which was later part of the [[British occupation zone in Germany|British occupation zone]]. In August 1948, Hagen was included in the new state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and soon became part of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] (FRG, also known as [[West Germany]]), founded in 1949.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Hagen experienced another stormy growth and mainly elted into the flatter, northern plain.

=== Late 20th century to the present ===
At the beginning of the 1970s, the decline of heavy industry in Hagen began in the wake of the [[steel crisis]]. Hasper Hütte was completely shut down between 1972 and 1982, Gussstahlwerke Wittmann went bankrupt and two of the three plants of Stahlwerke Südwestfalen were closed. Further job losses affected the food industry with the breweries Bettermann and Andreas, the confectionery manufacturers Villosa and Grothe and the production plant of [[Brandt (company)|Zwieback Brandt]].

The pedestrian zone in the city centre was opened in the 1970s.

In the early 1980s, Hagen made a name for itself as the ‘Liverpool of [[Neue Deutsche Welle|New German Wave (Neue Deutsche Welle)]]’. Many well-known musicians and bands of this musical genre (including [[Nena]], [[Extrabreit]] and the sisters [[Annette Humpe|Annette]] and [[Inga Humpe]]) have their roots in Hagen.

Economically, Hagen came under renewed pressure in the 1990s due to increasing globalisation. A further wave of deindustrialisation began in the steel sector, while Hagen's population declined at the same time. Hagen's debt level was €1.383 billion on 31 December 2012.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kredite, Kassenkredite und Wertpapierschulden der Gemeinden und Gemeindeverbände Nordrhein-Westfalens am 31.12.2012 |url=https://www.it.nrw.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/2013/pdf/117_13.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113705/https://www.it.nrw.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/2013/pdf/117_13.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 }}</ref>

Since the 2000s, major new construction and renovation projects have been realised that have significantly shaped Hagen's cityscape today. Examples include the Volme- and Rathaus-Galerie, the redesign of Friedrich-Ebert-Platz and the station forecourt (Berliner Platz) as well as the construction of the new town hall on the riverside.

In mid-July 2021, Hagen was affected by a flood disaster caused by heavy rainfall. In particular, damage was caused in the Volme valley and Hohenlimburg.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Stubbe |first=Jens |date=2021-08-19 |title=Hochwasser in Hagen: Nach der Flut türmen sich Trümmerberge |url=https://www.wp.de/staedte/hagen/article233091175/Hochwasser-in-Hagen-Nach-der-Flut-tuermen-sich-Truemmerberge.html |access-date=2024-08-18 |website=www.wp.de |language=de}}</ref>

==Economy==
Owing to the extensive use of water power along the rivers Ruhr, Lenne, Volme and Ennepe, metal processing played an important role in the region of Hagen in and even before the 15th century.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
In the 17th and 18th centuries, [[textile]] and steel industries, as well as [[paper]] production were developed here.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In the early 21st century, Hagen is the home of the Suedwestfaelische Industrie- und Handelskammer, as well as [[Sparkasse Hagen]], the local [[Sparkasse (Germany)|public savings bank]]. The bank's former headquarters, the [[Sparkasse Hagen Tower]], was a regional landmark until its demolition in 2004.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The city is heavily indebted and in the process of cutting city services in order to balance its budget.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The city has capitalized on the export of a wide variety of breads, most notably ''Hagenschmagenbrot'', a traditional dark bread.

==Education==

One of the five branches of [[South Westphalia University of Applied Sciences]] is located in the city (also: Fachhochschule Südwestfalen (FH SWF)), which offers various engineering programmes. This institution was founded in the city in 1824.

==Attractions==
[[File:Lange Riege.jpg|thumb|Half-timbered houses "Lange Riege" (17th century)]]Hagen is home to the ''LWL-Freilichtmuseum Hagen'', or [[Hagen Westphalian Open-Air Museum]], a collection of historic industrial facilities. Trades such as printing, brewing, smithing, milling, and many others are represented, not only with static displays, but as living, working operations that visitors may in some cases participate in. It is located near the Hagen community of [[Eilpe]].

The [[Historisches Centrum Hagen]] includes the [[city museum]] and [[Werdringen]] castle. In the [[Blätterhöhle]] cave in Hagen, the oldest fossils of modern people in [[Westphalia]] and the [[Ruhr]] were found. Some date to the early [[Mesolithic]], 10,700 years B.C.E. It seems that the descendants of Mesolithic people in this area maintained a foraging lifestyle for more than 2000 years after the arrival of farming societies.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.1245049 | title=2000 Years of Parallel Societies in Stone Age Central Europe | date=2013 | last1=Bollongino | first1=Ruth | last2=Nehlich | first2=Olaf | last3=Richards | first3=Michael P. | last4=Orschiedt | first4=Jörg | last5=Thomas | first5=Mark G. | last6=Sell | first6=Christian | last7=Fajkošová | first7=Zuzana | last8=Powell | first8=Adam | last9=Burger | first9=Joachim | journal=Science | volume=342 | issue=6157 | pages=479–481 | pmid=24114781 | bibcode=2013Sci...342..479B }}</ref>

==Transport==
[[File:Hagen-Vorhalle 20080830.jpg|thumb|Marshalling yard Hagen-Vorhalle]]
The [[Autobahn]]en [[Bundesautobahn 1|A1]], [[Bundesautobahn 45|A45]] and [[Bundesautobahn 46|A46]] pass by Hagen.

Hagen has been an important rail junction for the southeastern Ruhr valley since the first rail line opened in 1848. The [[marshalling yard]] of Hagen-Vorhalle is among Germany's largest, and the [[Hagen Hauptbahnhof|central station]] offers connections to the [[InterCityExpress|ICE]] network of [[Deutsche Bahn]] as well as to local and [[S-Bahn]] services. Since December 2005, Hagen has also been the starting point for a service into [[Essen]], the [[Ruhr-Lenne-Express]], operated by [[Abellio Deutschland]]. Since 2022, it has been operated by [[DB Regio]].

Local traffic is handled by [[Hagener Straßenbahn]] (Hagen Tramways), which, despite its name, offers only bus services, as the last [[tram]]way route in Hagen was abandoned in May 1976. All in all there is a large-scale network of 36 bus lines in Hagen. All local rail and bus services operate under the transport association [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr|VRR]].
