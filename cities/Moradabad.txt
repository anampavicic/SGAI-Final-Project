Throughout its four centuries of existence, the city has gone through multiple regime changes. It was firstly a part of the Delhi Sultanate, then flourished under Mughal empire, then was annexed into the [[Kingdom of Rohilkhand]] in 1742, and then came under the control of [[Oudh State]] in 1774 after the fall of Rohillas in the [[First Rohilla War]]. Finally, it was ceded to the [[British East India Company]] by the [[Nawab of Oudh]] in 1801.<ref name="gazetter pg 429">{{cite web |title=Imperial Gazetteer of India, Volume 17, page 429 -- Digital South Asia Library |url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V17_435.gif |website=dsal.uchicago.edu |access-date=6 December 2019}}</ref> In the early 19th century, the British divided the [[Rohilkhand]] area into the [[Rampur State]] and two districts: the [[Bareilly district|Bareilly]] and Moradabad districts.

Moradabad was connected with railway lines during the latter half of the nineteenth century. A line connecting Moradabad to [[Chandausi]] was built in 1872 and it was continued up to [[Bareilly]] in 1873. The Bareilly-Moradabad chord via [[Rampur, Uttar Pradesh|Rampur]] was completed in 1894, which was extended to [[Saharanpur]] in 1886. A branch line to [[Aligarh]] via Chandausi was opened in 1894, while Moradabad was linked to [[Ghaziabad]] in 1900.<ref name=orr>{{cite web | url = http://management.ebooks6.com/The-Oudh-Rohilkhand-Railway-download-w23852.html | title = Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway | publisher = Management Ebooks | access-date = 17 January 2014 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://archive.today/20140111051716/http://management.ebooks6.com/The-Oudh-Rohilkhand-Railway-download-w23852.html | archive-date = 11 January 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-history2.html |title = IR History – Early Days II (1870-1899)| publisher= IRFCA| access-date = 17 January 2014}}</ref> It is also the divisional headquarter of the Moradabad division of [[Northern Railway zone|Northern Railway]] (NR).<ref name="NR">{{cite web |title=Northern Railway: Moradabad Division |url=http://www.moradabadrail.in/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801215150/http://moradabadrail.in/ |archive-date=1 August 2015 |access-date=2015-07-29 |publisher=Moradabadrail.in |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Moradabad (UP), India &#124; Official Website |url=http://moradabad.nic.in |access-date=2015-07-29 |publisher=Moradabad.nic.in}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Founded by Rustam Khan, the governor of [[Rohilkhand|Katehar]] under the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor Shah Jahan, Moradabad is named after prince [[Murad Bakhsh]], the youngest son of the emperor.  It was originally known as Chaupala and was a part of the Katehar region, before falling to Mughal governor Rustam Khan Dakhani in 1624, who then changed its name to ''"Rustamnagar"'', naming it upon himself.

The name Rustamnagar, however, was short-lived. Shah Jahan soon called Rustam Khan to his court and demanded an explanation for why he had exceeded his orders. In an attempt to placate the emperor, Rustam Khan named the city ''Muradabad'' in honor of the young prince, Murad Bakhsh. The emperor was satisfied and permitted Rustam Khan to remain in charge of the new city, which now came to replace Sambhal as the Mughal governors' capital of the Katehar region, and the name Muradabad (or Moradabad) has been in use ever since.<ref name="Gazetteer">{{cite book |last1= |first1= |url=https://ia801402.us.archive.org/14/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.181620/2015.181620.Moradabad---A-Gazetteer_text.pdf |title=Moradabad - A Gazetteer |date=1911 |publisher=Government Press |location=Allahabad |pages= |access-date=22 January 2021}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Delhi Sultanate era (12th century–16th century) ===
Moradabad was originally part of the Katehr (pronounced ''"K-the-r"'') region, and it was a stronghold of the Katheria Rajputs.<ref name="Gazetteer" /> The Katherias were known for insurrections and surprise attacks against their Muslim rulers, and due to that reason the rulers also used to attack and plunder the region as much as possible. Between 1200 and 1424 several attacks were done on the region by rulers of different dynasties under [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi sultanate]], each time with an intention to completely destroy it and kill every single inhabitant. However, Katheria Rajputs survived as they were very skilled at evading attacks by hiding in the jungles. The vicious cycle of violence ended only in 1424 when [[Khizr Khan]], the leader of [[Khalji dynasty|Khilji dynasty]] ruling over the region, died and Har Singh, a prominent leader of Katherias, subjected to the Delhi sultanate rule. After that nothing significant happened for at least two centuries and the region remained largely in peace.<ref name="Gazetteer" />

=== Mughal empire (1539–1742) ===
In 1530, the Katehr region came under control of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal empire]]. However, the Mughal emperor [[Humayun]] soon lost his grip over the empire and the region was conquered by [[Sher Shah Suri]] of [[Sur Empire|Sur empire]]. Then it remained under Sur empire for 16 years before being reconquered by Humayun.<ref name="Gazetteer" />

Under the [[Mughal Empire]], Moradabad city was known as '''Chaupala''', and it was part of the Mugalpura [[pargana]], which in turn was part of the [[sarkar (administrative division)|sarkar]] of [[Sambhal]] as per [[Ain-i-Akbari]].<ref name="Ain-i-Akbari">{{cite book |last1=Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak |url=https://archive.org/details/ainiakbarivolum00mubgoog |title=The Ain-i-Akbari |last2=Jarrett |first2=Henry Sullivan |date=1891 |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bengal |location=Calcutta |page=290 |access-date=22 January 2021}}</ref> It produced a revenue of 1,340,812 [[dam (Indian coin)|dam]]s for the imperial treasury and it provided a force of 500 infantry and 100 cavalry to the Mughal army. 
[[File:Jama Masjid Moradabad Facade.jpg|left|thumb|The facade of Moradabad's Jama Masjid founded by Rustam Khan]]
The most significant event in the history of Moradabad came in 1624. That year a Katheria leader of Rampur named Raja Ram Singh invaded the [[Tarai]] region. The raja of [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]] complained about it to Mughal emperor [[Shah Jahan]], who then sent his general and governor of [[Sambhal district|Sambhal]] Rustam Khan Dakhani to deal with the disturbance. Rustam Khan captured Chaupala, put Ram Singh to death, and refounded the city as '''''Rustamnagar'''''. He built a new fort and great mosque (Jama Masjid) on the banks of Ramganga river, and shifted the capital from Sambhal to this new city. It was the first Jama Masjid to be founded on the banks of a river, and it stands intact to this day, with an inscription dated to 1632.<ref name="Gazetteer" />

Shah Jahan, however, was not very pleased with the actions of Rustam Khan. He summoned Rustam to his ''darbar'' and asked him why he exceeded the instructions of emperor and what was the name that he had given to the new city. Rustam Khan sensed the mood of the emperor, and with great presence of mind stated that he has named the city Muradabad in honor of prince Murad Bakhsh, a son of Shah Jahan. The emperor was satisfied and allowed Rustam Khan to remain in charge of the city.<ref name="Gazetteer" />

==== Rohilkhand state (1742–1774) ====
In 1730s, people from a number of Afghan tribes, collectively known as [[Rohilla]]s, were fleeing [[Afghanistan]] because of [[Nader Shah]]'s invasion. They arrived in large numbers and settled in all parts of the Katehr region, including Moradabad. One [[Ali Mohammed Khan]] among them acquired considerable estate in the region and ultimately attained the status of Nawab under protection of Moradabad's Mughal governor Sheikh Azmatullah. He then founded the Ruhelkhand state under protection of Mughal empire in 1742, which consisted all of Moradabad district as well as Bareilly, Rampur, and Amroha. The region largely prospered under Rohillas despite the invasions of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmed Shah Abdali]] and [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]]. However, in their last invasion Marathas completely plundered and ravaged the city of Sambhal and Moradabad.<ref name="Gazetteer" />

==== Oudh state (1774–1801) ====
The Nawab of Oudh, [[Shuja-ud-Daula]], has promised Rohillas to drive Marathas out of the entire Rohilkhand region in exchange of a sum of 40 lakhs. He kept his part of the promise, but ultimately Rohillas reneged on it and did not make the payment. The Nawab of Oudh then staked claim to the entire Rohilkhand region, and started occupying its cities and bringing Rohilla leaders under his influence, including the governors of Moradabad. He ultimately defeated Rohilla leader [[Hafiz Rahmat Khan Barech|Hafiz Rahmat Khan]] in the battle of Miranpur Katra, putting an end to Rohilkhand state and bringing all of its territory, including Moradabad, under Oudh rule in 1774. By that time Moradabad was already devastated because of Maratha invasion, and under Oudh rule its condition only deteriorated.<ref name="Gazetteer" />

=== British Empire (1801–1947) ===
Oudh state had incurred significant debts from the British empire by maintaining British troops in their dominion for the purpose of security from invaders. Since it was unable to pay those debts, in 1801 the Oudh state ceded entire Rohilkhand region to British empire for extinction of those debts.<ref name="Gazetteer" /> This brought Moradabad under the control of British empire, starting another major chapter of its history. The already deteriorated economic condition of the city worsened further under British rule because of their ignorance towards the landholding class of the city. Their policies completely neglected landowners and tried to create a new landholding class by way of a bidding system. The landholders, in turn, resorted to use of force to protect their lands.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal |last=Husain |first=Iqbal |date=1993 |title=The Gentry and People in Muradabad and Badaun, 1857 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44143029 |journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress |volume=54 |pages=563–573 |jstor=44143029 |issn=2249-1937}}</ref>

On the other hand, common man was also not doing very well. Average income and wages had almost halved, which was fueling discontent among the labor class as well. This discontent erupted against the British rule in the rebellion of 1857.<ref name=":4" />

==== The Rebellion of 1857 ====
During the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], Moradabad was one of those areas from where British officers had to evacuate and the rebels formed an alternative government. Unlike other places where rebelling was largely limited to sepoys and a few unsocial elements, in Moradabad the public (both landowners as well as common man) was also supporting it because of repressive policies under the British rule.<ref name="Gazetteer" />

On 15 May 1857, a fierce battle ensued between the rebel sepoys of 20th Native Infantry and the forces of 29th Native Infantry led by collector [[John Cracroft Wilson|Mr. JC Wilson]]. One sepoy was killed, while eight were captured and taken prisoners. But three days later on 19 May the rebellion broke out in 29th Native Infantry as well and the district jail was broken, from where 170 prisoners and rebel sepoys escaped.<ref name="Gazetteer" />

On 8 May the news of Mutiny in Bareilly came to the city, and its effect was instantaneous: ''the sepoys of 29th Native Infantry overtook the British treasury and challenged their English officers.''<ref name="Gazetteer" /> The British officers as well as their family members had to escape to the valleys of Nainital, and those who did not were killed in the violence of rebellion. [[Nawab Majju Khan]], a leader of the rebels and a descendant of Sheikh Azmatullah, became the new governor of Moradabad. He reigned supreme until he was overthrown on 23 June by Asad Ali Khan, the uncle of Rampur's [[Yusef Ali Khan|Nawab Yusef Ali Khan]], who was helping the British empire.<ref name="Gazetteer" /> But despite having appointed his uncle in charge of the city Nawab-Rampur had little control over the state of affairs in the city as there was a feeling of resentment and anger among the public against English and those who were supporting the English. So violence and anarchy continued to prevail in the city.<ref name="Gazetteer" />

A year later, Britishers returned to the city on 21 April 1858, with a bigger force and started capturing the freedom fighters. Those who were captured were killed in the most brutal ways to terrorize the public. They were shot dead, hanged, and many were thrown alive into lime furnaces. Nawab Majju Khan was also captured and shot dead, with his body hanged through a Tamarind tree in Galshaheed area.<ref>{{Cite web |last=रहमान |first=उबैदुर |date=2022-08-14 |title=Independence Day Special: भुलाई नहीं जा सकती शहीद नवाब मज्जू खां की कुर्बानी, इनके डर से पहाड़ों में छिप गए थे अंग्रेज |url=https://www.abplive.com/states/up-uk/moradabad-uttar-pradesh-freedom-struggle-of-1857-nawab-majju-khan-raised-voice-against-british-ann-2191806 |access-date=2024-04-04 |website=www.abplive.com |language=hi}}</ref> On April 30, 1858, the British rule over Moradabad was re-established.<ref name="Gazetteer" />

==== Civil Disobedience Movement and Quit India Movement ====
Moradabad played a major role in the [[Civil disobedience|Civil Disobedience]] and [[Quit India Movement|Quit India]] Movements initiated by Mahatma Gandhi. Civil Disobedience Movement was planned at the 1920 convention of Oudh state Congress in Moradabad—an event which was attended by all major leaders of the Congress party, including [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Pt. Nehru]], [[Sarojini Naidu]], [[Annie Besant]], etc.<ref>{{Cite web |title=महात्मा गांधी की एक आवाज पर घर से निकल पड़ा था मुरादाबाद का बच्चा, बूढ़ा और जवान, पढ़ें 1920 की कहानी - Gandhi Jayanti 2022 Moradabad Person Left House on Mahatma Gandhi Voice read Story of 1920 |url=https://www.jagran.com/uttar-pradesh/moradabad-city-gandhi-jayanti-2022-moradabad-person-left-house-on-mahatma-gandhi-voice-read-story-of1920-23113627.html |access-date=2024-04-04 |website=Jagran |language=hi}}</ref> When the movement began in 1932, Moradabad's people also participated in it to protest against the unlawful arrests and repression of freedom fighters.

There were even more protests and violence in the city after that to rise against the repressive means adopted by Britishers to quell the movement.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":6" />

=== Post-independence (1947–present) ===
India became independent in 1947, and since Moradabad was not a part of any princely state at that time, it became a part of the newly independent country immediately after that. The city was then industrialized and developed to uplift the economic condition of people, and largely existed in peace for over three decades. A major Hindu-Muslim riot took place in 1980 though, which brought the city to nation's attention. 

==== 1980 Hindu-Muslim riots ====
{{Main|1980 Moradabad riots}}
The 1980 Moradabad riots are sometimes attributed as UP's first major incident of communal violence in Independent India.<ref name=":23">{{Cite web |date=2023-05-17 |title=The death of a report: Moradabad was UP's first big riot after 1947; the rest you have heard before {{!}} Political Pulse News,The Indian Express |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/moradabad-was-ups-first-big-riot-after-1947-8613856/ |access-date=2024-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230517143817/https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/moradabad-was-ups-first-big-riot-after-1947-8613856/ |archive-date=17 May 2023 }}</ref><ref name=":24">{{Cite web |date=2023-05-18 |title=The Moradabad riots of 1980: the incident and its political fallout {{!}} Explained News,The Indian Express |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/the-moradabad-riots-of-1980-the-incident-and-its-political-fallout-8615182/ |access-date=2024-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230518055230/https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/the-moradabad-riots-of-1980-the-incident-and-its-political-fallout-8615182/ |archive-date=18 May 2023 }}</ref> The immediate catalyst for rioting was the rumor of a stray animal entering the Eidgah on 13 August 1980, the day of [[Eid al-Fitr|Eid-al-Fitr]] when more than 50,000 Muslims had gathered at the Eidgah for their prayers.<ref name=":23" /><ref name=":24" /> When the Muslims asked police personnel deployed on duty to remove the animal, it led to heated arguments between both sides, followed by stone-pelting on police forces. 

The police and Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) personnel then resorted to firing, which resulted in hundreds of civilians being killed.<ref name=":23" /><ref name=":24" /> The official death toll (including missing people) reported by the state government of that time was 289, though unofficial sources claimed the figure to be much higher and nobody knows the exact death toll for sure. The violence didn't remain confined to Moradabad—it spread to other nearby cities including [[Sambhal]], [[Bareilly]], and [[Delhi]], eventually reaching as far as [[Aligarh]] and even [[Prayagraj]].<ref name=":23" /><ref name=":24" /> It took several months for normalcy to return post these clashes.

== Government and Politics ==

=== Civic administration ===
[[File:Moradabad Municipal Corporation.jpg|thumb|The building of Moradabad Municipal Corporation or Nagar Nigam Moradabad]]
The civic administration of Moradabad city is managed by the Moradabad [[Municipal corporation|Municipal Corporation]], also known as Nagar Nigam Moradabad (NNM). It is one of the only 17 Nagar Nigams in the state of Uttar Pradesh. By comparison, there are 200 [[Nagar Palika Parishad Bah|nagar palikas]] and 545 [[nagar panchayat]]s in the state.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Home |url=http://urbandevelopment.up.nic.in/ |access-date=14 April 2024 |website=Urban Development, Government of Uttar Pradesh}}</ref> It got the status of Nagar Nigam in 1994; before that it was a Nagar Palika.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Moradabad News: 28 साल के नगर निगम इतिहास में एक उप चुनाव भी |url=https://www.amarujala.com/uttar-pradesh/moradabad/by-election-municipal-corporation-history-moradabad-news-c-15-1-mbd1026-115105-2023-04-14 |access-date=2024-04-14 |website=Amar Ujala |language=hi}}</ref>

The Nagar Nigam of Moradabad is helmed by an elected [[Mayor]] who is chosen through voting directly by the public for a duration of five years. Besides mayor, 70 ward councillors are also elected by the public, each of whom represents a specific area (known as a "ward" in administrative terms) of the city. The term of mayor ends at five years, but there is also a permanent executive of Nagar Nigam in the form of  [[Municipal commissioner (India)|Municipal Commissioner]] with most of the executive powers vested in the various committees under their chairmanship. The commissioner is usually a [[Provincial Civil Service (Uttar Pradesh)|Provincial Civil Service]] (PCS) officer appointed by the state government,<ref name=":18">{{Cite web |title=Nagar Nigam Moradabad |url=https://www.nagarnigammoradabad.in/Water%20Works%20Department.php |access-date=2024-04-14 |website=www.nagarnigammoradabad.in}}</ref> and he is responsible for all day-to-day functions of the municipal corporation.

A [[governing body]] consisting of [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLAs]], [[Member of parliament|MP]], Municipal Commissioner, and [[District magistrate|District Magistrate]] known as the Nagar Nigam Board organizes periodic meetings chaired by the mayor to discuss and plan for the various development works and issues of Moradabad. The councillors raise issues related to their wards in these meetings. The [[budget]] of Nagar Nigam is also passed in these meetings,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-09-11 |title=मुरादाबाद : 51560 लाख के प्रस्तावित बजट को नगर निगम कार्यकारिणी की मंजूरी |url=https://www.amritvichar.com/article/402524/moradabad--municipal-corporation-executive-approves-the-proposed-budget-of-rs-51560-lakh |access-date=2024-04-14 |website=www.amritvichar.com |language=hi}}</ref> and the expenses according to passed budget are then carried out under the watch of municipal commissioner.

Some of the works carried out by NNM include:

* [[Street lighting]]
* [[Road]] construction and management
* [[Water supply]] management
* Birth and [[death registration]] and issuance of their certificates
* [[Horticulture]] development and management
* Development and management of [[park]]s and other public spaces
* [[Waste management]]

The Nagar Nigam relies largely on grants from Central and State [[Finance Commission]]s to carry out these activities. It also generates some revenue from House Tax, Water Tax, [[Property tax|Property Tax]], Trade license fees, and income generated from advertisements on the roads.<ref name=":18" />

=== Politics ===
The Moradabad city is a part of the [[Moradabad Lok Sabha constituency|Moradabad parliamentary constituency]], and therefore it sends one MP to the parliament. It also sends two MLAs to the [[Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly]], one each from [[Moradabad Nagar Assembly constituency|Moradabad Nagar]] and [[Moradabad Rural Assembly constituency|Moradabad Rural]] assembly constituencies. The Lok sabha constituency has not sent an incumbent MP back to the parliament for two successive terms since 1999. The current MP is [[Ruchi Veera]] of [[Samajwadi Party]], who defeated [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]]'s [[Kunwar Sarvesh Kumar Singh|Kunwar Sarvesh]] with a margin of 105,762 votes in the [[2024 Indian general election|general elections of 2024]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-06-04 |title=General Election to Parliamentary Constituencies: Trends & Results June-2024 Parliamentary Constituency 6 - Moradabad (Uttar Pradesh) |url=https://results.eci.gov.in/PcResultGenJune2024/candidateswise-S246.htm |website=Election Commission of India}}</ref>

Due to demographics, Muslim voters play a huge role in the [[politics]] of the city. Since its creation in 1952, Moradabad lok sabha seat has been won 11 times by seven Muslim candidates. Remaining six times it has been won by five Hindu candidates.<ref name=":19">{{Cite web |last=Bharatvarsh |first=TV9 |date=2024-03-17 |title=मुरादाबाद लोकसभा सीटः क्या BJP को दूसरी बार यहां पर मिलेगी जीत, या फिर विपक्ष का चलेगा जादू |url=https://www.tv9hindi.com/elections/lok-sabha-election/uttar-pradesh-chunav/moradabad-lok-sabha-constituency-profile-bjp-opposition-alliance-india-bsp-elections-2024-2336301.html |access-date=2024-04-14 |website=TV9 Bharatvarsh |language=hi}}</ref><ref name=":20">{{Cite news |date=2024-04-09 |title=Moradabad constituency of Uttar Pradesh Lok Sabha Election 2024: Date of voting, result, candidates list, main parties, schedule |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/moradabad-constituency-of-uttar-pradesh-lok-sabha-election-2024-date-of-voting-result-candidates-list-main-parties-schedule/articleshow/109173028.cms |access-date=2024-04-14 |work=The Times of India |issn=0971-8257}}</ref>

Coming to assembly constituencies, the Moradabad Nagar constituency's winning trend is exact opposite of the Lok sabha seat. It has been won 11 times by six Hindu candidates and seven times by five Muslim candidates. It is also not a swing constituency as it has had a history of repeating the incumbents for the most part of its existence since 1951. This trend was almost on the verge of being broken in [[2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election|2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections]] though, because current MLA [[Ritesh Kumar Gupta]] won against SP's [[Mohammad Yusuf Ansari|Mohammed Yusuf Ansari]] with a wafer-thin majority of 782 votes only.<ref>{{Cite web |title=GEN ELECTION TO VIDHAN SABHA TRENDS & RESULT MARCH-2022 |url=https://results.eci.gov.in/ResultAcGenMar2022/ConstituencywiseS2428.htm?ac=28 |access-date=14 April 2024 |website=Election Commission of India}}</ref> It is a BJP-stronghold, as BJP has won it five out of seven times since 1993.

Moradabad Rural assembly constituency, on the other hand, largely follows the pattern of Lok Sabha constituency as it has been won 13 times by seven Muslim candidates since its creation in 1957. A total of three Hindu candidates have won it four times since its creation. The current MLA is Mohammed Nasir of SP, who defeated BJP's KK Misra by 56,820 votes in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |title=GEN ELECTION TO VIDHAN SABHA TRENDS & RESULT MARCH-2022 |url=https://results.eci.gov.in/ResultAcGenMar2022/ConstituencywiseS2427.htm?ac=27 |access-date=14 April 2024 |website=Election Commission of India}}</ref> These results reveal the sharp contrast in politics of urban and local centres of the city. Since 1996 it is a stronghold of the Samajwadi party, which has won it five out of six times.

Most of this industry belongs to the [[Unorganised sector (India)|unorganized sector]], so all the data about it comes largely in the form of estimates from industry associations. Two such local industry associations are Brass Handicrafts Manufacturers Association (BHMA) and Peetal Basti Dastkar Association (PBDA). The industry is also prone to other challenges of [[Informal economy|informal sector]] such as unavailability of credit, poor access to government schemes, commoditization, outdated technology, and low job security.

=== Manufacturing ===
Manufacturing industries of brassware and other metalware are unarguably the largest economic drivers and employment generators of Moradabad. While there are more than 9,000 registered industrial units in the city according to government records,<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":7" /> the estimates provided by industry association (namely Peetal Basti Dastkar Association)<ref name=":9" /> suggest that there are between 30,000 and 40,000 manufacturing units involved in the brass industry alone. The most manufactured items in these industrial units are home decor items (i.e. lamps, flower pots,  showpieces, etc.), utensils, and idols of various deities.

=== Export ===
Moradabad is popularly known as the Brass City of the country. Countries like Britain, the US, Middle East, Germany and Canada import [[brassware]] from Moradabad. There are about 4,000 export units<ref name=":9" /> in the city out of which 600 are registered with the government.<ref name=":8" /> Besides brass handicrafts other major products exported from Moradabad include iron sheets, metalwares, aluminum, artworks, and glassware. Outside the spectrum of metals, mint worth several crores is also exported from Moradabad.

===Special Economic Zone===
Moradabad [[Special Economic Zone]] (SEZ) is the only Uttar Pradesh Government developed SEZ<ref name="moradabadsez.gov.in">{{Cite web |title=Moradabad Special Economic Zone |url=http://moradabadsez.gov.in/about.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230913060444/http://moradabadsez.gov.in/about.html |archive-date=September 13, 2023 |access-date= |website=Moradabad SEZ |df=dmy-all}}</ref> in northern India. It is headed by the Development Commissioner of the [[Noida]] SEZ and locally governed by the Assistant Development Commissioner. It was set up in 2003 at Pakbara–Dingarpur Road in Moradabad on a 421.565-acre plot of land and operationalized in April 2007. According to data published by the Noida SEZ on behalf of NSDL, it had the merchandise exports of ₹272 crores in FY 22–23.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Moradabad SEZ 2022-23 data.pdf |url=https://nsez.gov.in/Resources/Moradabad%20SEZ%202022-23%20data.pdf |website=NSEZ}}</ref> More than 42% of the export from this SEZ went to the [[United States]], with [[Germany]] and [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] being second and third at 14% and 8%, respectively.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ExportShippingBillData2022-23 (Moradabad SEZ) |url=https://moradabadsez.gov.in/resources/Moradabad%20SEZ%202022-23%20Export.pdf }}</ref>

UP Government has so far invested a sum of ₹110 crores on its development through [[UP State Industrial Development Corporation|UPSIDC]]. The SEZ provides excellent infrastructure, supportive services, and sector specific facilities for the Handicraft Trade. Proximity to Delhi-NCR and availability of skilled and dedicated manpower makes it ideal for setting up various industries in handicrafts and its allied fields. In spite of the global slowdown in the handicraft trade, the Moradabad SEZ has grown from just one unit in 2007 to 58 operational units in 2021.<ref name="moradabadsez.gov.in" /> It has 465 developed plots of varying sizes. Future expansion of this has been strategically planned and soon it will be available for few more export sectors.

Infrastructure, supportive services and trade related facilities have been substantially upgraded during the last few years. Moradabad SEZ offers access to the global telecommunication network, uninterrupted power supply and efficient local transport system. An ultra-modern RSU Telephone Exchange has been installed in the Zone, besides the availability of all the mobile frequencies in and around the zone through various mobile communication towers. An independent feeder line has since been provided for uninterrupted power supply, the reliability and quality of power supply has improved with the pre-commissioned 32 / 11 KVA / 5.0 MVA <ref name="moradabadsez.gov.in" /> Power Sub-station within Moradabad SEZ. Proximity to Delhi-NCR provides easy access to the financial and commercial infrastructure of the capital. Customs wing ensures prompt and on the spot clearances of export/import consignments through web based system called ''SEZ Online.''<ref name="moradabadsez.gov.in" />

== Cityscape ==
Unlike major cities that rely on apartments, skyscrapers and vertical growth, Moradabad's cityscape consists mostly of two and three-storey buildings developed by individual residents. Higher buildings (up to 10 storeys or more) are generally found in private townships of the city or in commercial establishments, such as hospitals or colleges. Many of these [[high-rise buildings]] have been built in the last decade (i.e. post-2010) as city's population swelled because of people arriving from neighboring states and cities in search of education or employment opportunities. The state government's Avas Vikas department has also built apartment complexes of up to four storeys in the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=MDA News : नया मुरादाबाद को बसाने में लग जाएंगे कई साल, मकान के ल‍िए पांच द‍िन में आए केवल 15 आवेदन - MDA New Moradabad Housing Scheme, MDA News It will take many years to settle the new Moradabad Only 15 applications for house came in five days |url=https://www.jagran.com/uttar-pradesh/moradabad-city-mda-news-it-will-take-many-years-to-settle-the-new-moradabad-only-15-applications-for-house-came-in-five-days-21803802.html |access-date=2024-03-29 |website=Jagran |language=hi}}</ref> The trend is expected to continue with more private townships lined up towards the outer areas of the city.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2024-03-12 |title=Lohia group to develop projects in Moradabad, Lucknow and Delhi |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/property-/-cstruction/lohia-group-to-develop-projects-in-moradabad-lucknow-and-delhi/articleshow/108437848.cms?from=mdr |access-date=2024-03-29 |work=The Economic Times |issn=0013-0389}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Chadha Group and TMU will make integrated township; market street will be built on Delhi-Kanth Road |url=https://www.bhaskar.com/local/uttar-pradesh/moradabad/news/chadha-group-and-tmu-will-make-integrated-township-market-street-will-be-built-on-delhi-kanth-road-130598537.html |access-date=March 29, 2024 |work=Dainik Bhaskar}}</ref>

=== Parks and recreation spaces ===
[[File:Company Baag Moradabad.jpg|thumb|A view of the Company Baag at night]]
Moradabad has a robust ecosystem of parks and recreational spaces in all of its neighborhoods and localities. Some popular ones among them include the Eco Herbal Park, Gautam Budh Park, Ambedkar Park and Company Baag. The Civil Lines located Company Baag is quite special among them all as it exists since the days of the British East India Company. Legend says that it used to serve as a residential centre for the English officers before being burned down in the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion of 1857]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-02-17 |title=Moradabad News: कभी अंग्रेजों की थीं यहां कोठियां,1857 में जलाकर बना दिया पार्क, अब लीज पर देने की है तैयारी |url=https://hindi.news18.com/news/uttar-pradesh/moradabad-moradabad-company-bagh-was-built-by-burning-cells-of-british-during-1857-gadar-movment-5400261.html |access-date=2024-03-29 |website=News18 हिंदी |language=hi}}</ref> After that Britishers rebuilt it into a garden for recreational purposes. Today it has been upgraded by the city administration with lots of greenery and lighting so people can use it as a place to play, wind down, and relax.

The city is also home to Prem Wonderland and Water Kingdom—an amusement park with swimming pool, water slides, wave pool, bar, restaurant, and plenty of fun features for people of all age groups.

=== Shopping centres ===
[[File:Town Hall Market Moradabad.jpg|thumb|View of a local market in Moradabad]]
[[File:Wave Mall Moradabad.jpg|thumb|A view of the Wave Mall, one of the first and largest shopping malls in Moradabad]]
Moradabad offers plenty of options for shopping enthusiasts of all kinds, from general purpose markets to product specific markets to brand outlets and modern shopping malls. General purpose markets like Budh Bazaar, Town hall, and the markets on Tadikhana chauraha or Gurhatti chauraha provide residents with all sorts of their shopping needs. On the other hand, dedicated markets also exist where one can find all the varieties of a particular product at value for money prices. Weekly markets are also organized in some of the city's areas on Sunday and Tuesday where people can go to do some value-for-money shopping.

In the last few years modern shopping malls and brand outlets have also sprung across the city where people can go to buy the premium products and have a good time while shopping.

=== Entertainment ===
There are many movie theaters and multiplexes in Moradabad equipped with latest technologies and amenities where people can go for entertainment. The most popular ones among them include [[PVR INOX|PVR]], Wave Cinemas, and Miglani Cinemas. Playgrounds for kids also exist in almost all localities.

The dishes in ''Muradabadi'' cuisine also derive their distinct taste and flavor from use of brass vessels and whole spices (i.e. "khada garam masala") and raw onions to cook the food''.'' While brass vessels preserve the natural taste of dishes by distributing heat evenly and preventing burning, whole spices add to the unique aroma and layered taste. Moradabad is also credited for introducing the first iteration of chaat masala to the country.<ref name=":1" />

== Issues ==

=== Floods ===
Moradabad has a history of floods due to the overflow of Ramganga river.<ref>{{cite web |title=Moradabad: People suffer due to flood |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/moradabad-people-suffer-due-to-flood/1/113518.html |access-date=12 October 2018 |website=India Today|date=21 September 2010 }}</ref> The water discharged from the [[Ramganga Dam]] in Kalagarh led to severe flooding in 2010,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Moradabad: People suffer due to flood |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/north/story/moradabad-people-suffer-due-to-flood-82453-2010-09-20 |access-date=2024-03-27 |website=India Today |date=21 September 2010 |language=en}}</ref> with flood water entering people's homes even in some of its most posh localities. There has not been a severe flood in the city since then, but the risk remains every year whenever it rains more than usual and rural areas on the banks of Ramganga river get submerged.

=== Pollution ===
Being an industrial city undergoing rapid transformation, Moradabad also faces the challenge of pollution. With a maximum of 114 decibels (db), the city is 2nd most noise polluted city in the world according to a United Nations Environment Program report published in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Moradabad 2nd most noise polluted city globally, says UNEP |url=https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/pollution/moradabad-2nd-most-noise-polluted-city-globally-says-unep-82096 |access-date=2024-03-27 |website=www.downtoearth.org.in |date=25 March 2022 |language=en}}</ref> In 2021, it was also the most air polluted city in the country outside the [[National Capital Region (India)|National Capital Region]] (NCR).<ref>{{Cite news |date=December 17, 2021 |title=At least 56 north Indian cities experience winter pollution trends similar to Delhi: CSE study |url=https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/air/at-least-56-north-indian-cities-experience-winter-pollution-trends-similar-to-delhi-cse-study-80739 |work=Down To Earth}}</ref>

However, the city has been consistently making strides to fix these challenges. In 2022, it won the first prize among 44 cities with a population of 0.3–1 million for reducing the PM10 concentration by 36% in the Swachh Vayu Survekshan (SVS) of the [[Central Pollution Control Board]] (CPCB).<ref>{{Cite news |date=2022-12-03 |title=UP cities dominate national survey on steps to improve air quality |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/up-cities-dominate-national-survey-on-steps-to-improve-air-quality/articleshow/95967134.cms |access-date=2024-03-27 |work=The Times of India |issn=0971-8257}}</ref> The following year, in 2023, it was ranked 2nd<ref>{{Cite web |title=Air Quality: स्वच्छ वायु सर्वेक्षण में मुरादाबाद ने देश में हासिल किया दूसरा स्थान, प्रदेश में पहले नंबर पर - Moradabad achieved second position in the country in clean air survey first position in the state |url=https://www.jagran.com/uttar-pradesh/moradabad-city-moradabad-achieved-second-position-in-the-country-in-clean-air-survey-first-position-in-the-state-23524900.html |access-date=2024-03-27 |website=Jagran |language=hi}}</ref> and in 2024 it was ranked 11th in the same survey for its air quality.<ref>{{Cite web |date=7 September 2024 |title=Swachh Vayu Sarvekshan 2024 |url=https://prana.cpcb.gov.in/ncapServices/robust/fetchFilesFromDrive/Swachh_Vayu_Survekshan_2024_Result.pdf |website=Swachh Vayu Sarvekshan 2024}}</ref>
