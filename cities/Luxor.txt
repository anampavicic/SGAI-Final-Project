== History ==
[[File:Luxor Temple R04.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[Luxor Temple]], seen from the east bank of the Nile]]
Luxor was the ancient city of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], the capital of [[Upper Egypt]] during the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]], and the city of [[Amun]], later to become the god Amun-Ra. The city was regarded in the ancient Egyptian texts as ''wAs.t'' (approximate pronunciation: "Waset"), which meant <!--"the foremost" or // commented this out since I never heard this etymology -- the word is not even close to "xnti" meaning "foremost", and I looked it up in the dictionary, the only word close to ws.t is ws, meaning scepter --> "city of the sceptre", and later in Demotic Egyptian as ''ta jpt'' (conventionally pronounced as "tA ipt" and meaning "the shrine/temple", referring to the jpt-swt, the temple now known by its Arabic name [[Karnak]], meaning "fortified village"), which the ancient Greeks adapted as Thebai and the Romans after them as Thebae. Thebes was also known as "the city of the 100 gates", sometimes being called "southern Heliopolis" ('Iunu-shemaa' in Ancient Egyptian), to distinguish it from the city of [[Iunu]] or [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], the main place of worship for the god Ra in the north. It was also often referred to as ''niw.t,'' which simply means "city", and was one of only three cities in Egypt for which this noun was used (the other two were [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] and Heliopolis); it was also called ''niw.t rst,'' "southern city", as the southernmost of them.

The importance of the city started as early as the [[11th Dynasty]], when the town grew into a thriving city.<ref name="Sacred">{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/egypt/luxor-history.htm |title=History of Luxor (Thebes) |publisher=Sacred Destinations |access-date=December 1, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013003321/http://www.sacred-destinations.com/egypt/luxor-history.htm |archive-date=October 13, 2008}}</ref> [[Montuhotep II]], who united Egypt after the troubles of the [[First Intermediate Period]], brought stability to the lands as the city grew in stature. The Pharaohs of the New Kingdom in their expeditions to [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], in today's northern [[Sudan]], and to the lands of [[Canaan]], [[Phoenicia]] and [[Syria]] saw the city accumulate great wealth and rose to prominence, even on a world scale.<ref name="Sacred"/> Thebes played a major role in expelling the invading forces of the [[Hyksos]] from Upper Egypt, and from the time of the [[18th Dynasty]] to the [[20th Dynasty]], the city had risen as the political, religious and military capital of Ancient Egypt.

The city attracted peoples such as the [[Babylonians]], the [[Mitanni]], the [[Hittites of Anatolia]] (modern-day Turkey), the [[Canaanites]] of Ugarit, the [[Phoenicians]] of [[Byblos]] and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], and the [[Minoans]] from the island of [[Crete]].<ref name="Sacred"/> A Hittite prince from Anatolia even came to marry with the widow of [[Tutankhamun]], [[Ankhesenamun]].<ref name="Sacred"/> The political and military importance of the city, however, faded during the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]], with Thebes being replaced as political capital by several cities in Northern Egypt, such as [[Bubastis]], [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]] and finally [[Alexandria]].

However, as the city of the god Amun-Ra, Thebes remained the religious capital of Egypt until the Greek period.<ref name="Sacred"/> The main god of the city was Amun, who was worshipped together with his wife, the Goddess [[Mut]], and their son [[Khonsu]], the God of the moon. With the rise of Thebes as the foremost city of Egypt, the local god Amun rose in importance as well and became linked to the sun god Ra, thus creating the new 'king of gods' Amun-Ra. His [[Precinct of Amun-Re|great temple]] at Karnak, just north of Thebes, was the most important temple of Egypt right until the end of antiquity.

Later, the city was attacked by [[Assyria]]n emperor [[Ashurbanipal]] who installed a new prince on the throne, [[Psamtik I]].<ref name="Sacred"/> The city of Thebes was in ruins and fell in significance. However, [[Alexander the Great]] did arrive at the temple of Amun, where the statue of the god was transferred from Karnak during the [[Opet Festival]], the great religious feast.<ref name="Sacred"/> Thebes remained a site of spirituality up to the Christian era, and attracted numerous Christian monks of the [[Roman Empire]] who established monasteries amidst several ancient monuments including the temple of [[Hatshepsut]], now called [[Deir el-Bahri]] ("the northern monastery").<ref name="Sacred"/>

Following the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]], part of the Luxor Temple was converted from a church to a mosque. This mosque is currently known as the [[Abu Haggag Mosque]] today.

The 18th century saw an increase of Europeans visiting Luxor, with some publishing their travels and documenting its surroundings, such as [[Claude Sicard]], [[Granger (Tourtechot)|Granger]], [[Frederick Louis Norden]], [[Richard Pococke]], [[Vivant Denon]] and others. By the 20th century, Luxor had become a major tourist destination.

In April 2018, the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of the shrine of god [[Osiris]]- Ptah Neb, dating back to the 25th dynasty in the [[Karnak|Temple of Karnak]]. According to archaeologist Essam Nagy, the material remains from the area contained clay pots, the lower part of a sitting statue and part of a stone panel showing an offering table filled with a sheep and a goose which were the symbols of the god Amun.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-04-22 |title=Archaeologists find bust of Roman emperor in Egypt dig in Aswan |url=https://www.arabnews.com/node/1289571/art-culture |access-date=2021-01-16 |website=Arab News |language=en |archive-date=May 7, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210507020030/https://www.arabnews.com/node/1289571/art-culture |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=DPA |first=Daily Sabah with |date=2018-04-22 |title=Archeologists find Roman emperor bust, ancient shrine in Egypt |url=https://www.dailysabah.com/history/2018/04/22/archeologists-find-roman-emperor-bust-ancient-shrine-in-egypt |access-date=2021-01-16 |website=Daily Sabah |language=en |archive-date=November 22, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211122081648/https://www.dailysabah.com/history/2018/04/22/archeologists-find-roman-emperor-bust-ancient-shrine-in-egypt |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-04-22 |title=Shrine to Osiris and bust of Roman emperor found in Egypt |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/science/shrine-to-osiris-and-bust-of-Roman-emperor-found-in-egypt/article/520449 |access-date=2021-01-16 |website=www.digitaljournal.com |archive-date=January 22, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210122041038/http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/science/shrine-to-osiris-and-bust-of-roman-emperor-found-in-egypt/article/520449 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On the same day in November 2018, two different discoveries were announced.

In October 2019, Egyptian archaeologists headed by [[Zahi Hawass]] revealed an ancient "industrial area" used to manufacture decorative artefacts, furniture and pottery for royal tombs. The site contained a big kiln to fire ceramics and 30 ateliers. According to Zahi Hawass, each atelier had a different aim – some of them were used to make pottery, others used to produce gold artefacts and others still to churn out furniture. About 75 meters below the valley, several items believed to have adorned wooden royal coffins, such as inlaid beads, silver rings and gold foil were unearthed. Some artefacts depicted the wings of deity [[Horus]].<ref>{{Cite web |first1=Julie |last1=Zaugg |first2=Nourhan |last2=Moustafa |title=Egyptian archeologists uncover ancient 'industrial area' filled with royal artifacts |url=https://www.cnn.com/style/article/egypt-archeology-valley-kings-intl-hnk-scli/index.html |access-date=2020-09-17 |website=CNN |date=October 11, 2019 |language=en |archive-date=November 30, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201130031021/https://www.cnn.com/style/article/egypt-archeology-valley-kings-intl-hnk-scli/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title="Egyptian archeologists uncover ancient 'industrial area' filled with royal artifacts" – CNN – infodecay |url=https://infodecay.com/egyptian-archeologists-uncover-ancient-industrial-area-filled-with-royal-artifacts-cnn/ |access-date=2020-09-17 |language=en-US |archive-date=October 16, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211016180658/https://infodecay.com/egyptian-archeologists-uncover-ancient-industrial-area-filled-with-royal-artifacts-cnn/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In October 2019, the Egyptian archaeological mission unearthed thirty well-preserved wooden [[coffin]]s (3,000 years old) in front of the [[Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut]] in [[El-Assasif]] Cemetery. The coffins contained mummies of twenty-three adult males, five adult females and two children, who are believed to be from the middle class. According to Hawass, mummies were decorated with mixed carvings and designs, including scenes from [[Ancient Egyptian deities|Egyptian gods]], [[hieroglyph]]s, and the [[Book of the Dead]], a series of spells that allowed the soul to navigate in the [[afterlife]]. Some of the coffins had the names of the dead engraved on them.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Alaa Elassar |title=Egypt unveils discovery of 30 ancient coffins with mummies inside |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/19/middleeast/egypt-discovers-coffins-mummies-trnd/index.html |access-date=2020-09-17 |website=CNN |date=October 20, 2019 |archive-date=November 29, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211129171703/https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/19/middleeast/egypt-discovers-coffins-mummies-trnd/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=2019-10-16 |title=Egypt archaeologists find 20 ancient coffins near Luxor |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50068575 |access-date=2020-09-17 |archive-date=January 1, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220101223925/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50068575 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Luxor |first=Reuters in |date=2019-10-19 |title=Archaeologists discover 30 ancient coffins in Luxor |url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/19/archaeologists-discover-30-ancient-coffins-with-mummies-in-luxor |access-date=2020-09-17 |website=the Guardian |language=en |archive-date=March 23, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210323162800/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/19/archaeologists-discover-30-ancient-coffins-with-mummies-in-luxor |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Beachum |first=Lateshia |title=Archaeologists discover more than 20 sealed coffins just as the ancient Egyptians left them |language=en-US |newspaper=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/10/16/archaeologists-discover-more-than-sealed-coffins-just-ancient-egyptians-left-them/ |access-date=2020-09-17 |issn=0190-8286 |archive-date=September 29, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210929064751/https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/10/16/archaeologists-discover-more-than-sealed-coffins-just-ancient-egyptians-left-them/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Geography ==
Approximately 4,000 years ago, a significant alteration in the geography of the Nile River occurred, particularly in the region near modern-day Luxor. This transformation involved the expansion of the [[floodplain]], which increased the availability of [[arable land]]. This geographic and environmental shift likely played a crucial role in supporting the agricultural productivity that underpinned the prosperity and stability of ancient Egyptian civilization during that period and over the years.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Peeters |first1=Jan |last2=Graham |first2=Angus |last3=Toonen |first3=Willem H.

=== Climate ===
Luxor has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] BWh) like the rest of Egypt. [[Aswan]] and Luxor have the hottest summer days of any other city in [[climate of Egypt|Egypt]]. Aswan and Luxor have nearly the same climate. Luxor is one of the sunniest and driest cities in the world. Average high temperatures are above {{convert|40|°C|0}} during summer (June, July, August). During the coolest month of the year, average high temperatures remain above {{convert|71.6|F|0|order=flip}} while average low temperatures remain above {{convert|5|°C|0}}.

The climate of Luxor has precipitation levels lower than even most other places in the [[Sahara]], with less than {{cvt|1|mm|2}} of average annual precipitation. The desert city is one of the driest ones in the world, and rainfall does not occur every year. The air in Luxor is more humid than Aswan but still very dry. There is an average relative humidity of 39.9%, with a maximum mean of 57% during winter and a minimum mean of 27% during summer.

The climate of Luxor is extremely clear, bright and sunny year-round, in all seasons, with a low seasonal variation, with about some 4,000 hours of annual sunshine, very close to the maximum theoretical sunshine duration.

In addition, Luxor, [[Minya, Egypt#Climate|Minya]], [[Sohag#Climate|Sohag]], [[Qena#Climate|Qena]] and [[Asyut#Climate|Asyut]] have the widest difference of temperatures between days and nights of any city in [[climate of Egypt|Egypt]], with almost {{convert|16|C-change}} difference.

The hottest temperature recorded was on May 15, 1991, which was {{convert|50|°C}} and the coldest temperature was on February 6, 1989, which was {{convert|-1|°C}}.<ref name="Voodoo Skies">{{cite web |url=http://voodooskies.com/weather/egypt/luxor |title=Luxor, Egypt |access-date=21 June 2013 |publisher=Voodoo Skies |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619160412/http://voodooskies.com/weather/egypt/luxor |archive-date=June 19, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

== Coptic Catholic Eparchy ==
{{prose|date=March 2017}}
The Coptic Catholic ([[Alexandrian Rite]]) minority established on November 26, 1895 an Eparchy ([[Eastern Catholic]] Diocese) of Luqsor (Luxor) alias Thebes, on territory split off from the [[Apostolic Vicariate of Egypt]]. Its episcopal see is a St. George [[cathedral]] in Luxor.

In turn, it lost territory on August 10, 1947 to establish the [[Coptic Catholic Eparchy of Assiut|Eparchy of Assiut]] and again on 14 September 1981 to establish [[Coptic Catholic Eparchy of Sohag|Sohag]].

The economy of Luxor, like that of many other Egyptian cities, is heavily dependent on tourism. Since 1988, Luxor is the only city that offers [[Hot air ballooning in Luxor|hot air balloon rides]] in Egypt, which is a common activity for tourists. Large numbers of people also work in agriculture, particularly [[sugarcane]]. There are also many industries, such as the pottery industry used in eating and many other uses.

The local economy was hit by the [[Luxor massacre]] in 1997, in which a total of 64 people (including 59 visiting tourists) were killed, at the time the worst terrorist attack in Egypt (before the [[2005 Sharm el-Sheikh attacks|Sharm el-Sheikh terrorist attacks]]).<ref>[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/752/fr4.htm Shock in Sharm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924125054/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/752/fr4.htm |date=2013-09-24 }} 23 July, Serene Assir, Al-Ahram Weekly</ref> The massacre reduced tourist numbers for several years.<ref>"Solidly ahead of oil, Suez Canal revenues, and remittances, tourism is Egypt's main hard currency earner at $6.5 billion per year."

Nineteen Asian and European tourists died when a [[2013 Luxor hot air balloon crash|hot air balloon crashed]] early on Tuesday, February 26, 2013 near Luxor following a mid-air gas explosion. It was one of the worst accidents involving tourists in Egypt. The casualties included French, British, Hungarian, Japanese nationals and nine tourists from Hong Kong.<ref>(Times of India, Indore, MP, India edition Wed, February 27, 2013)</ref>

To make up for shortfalls of income, many cultivate their own food. Goat's cheese, pigeons, subsidized and home-baked bread and homegrown tomatoes are commonplace among the majority of its residents.

== Tourism development ==
[[File:Winter Palace Luxor front.jpg|thumb|Winter Palace Luxor hotel front]]

A controversial tourism development plan aims to transform Luxor into the biggest vast open-air museum. The master plan envisions new roads, five-star hotels, glitzy shops, and an IMAX theatre. The main attraction is an 11&nbsp;million dollar project to unearth and restore the {{convert|2.7|km|1|abbr=off}} long Avenue of Sphinxes that once linked Luxor and Karnak temples. The ancient processional road was built by the pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]] and took its final form under [[Nectanebo I]] in 400 BCE. Over a thousand sphinx statues lined the road now being excavated which was covered by silt, homes, mosques and churches. Excavation started around 2004.<ref>{{cite web |last=McGrath |first=Cam |url=http://www.globalissues.org/news/2011/06/16/10131 |title=Mideast: Sphinx Avenue Paved With Bitter Memories — Global Issues |publisher=Globalissues.org |date=2011-06-16 |access-date=2011-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617111728/http://www.globalissues.org/news/2011/06/16/10131 |archive-date=June 17, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=McGrath |first=Cam |url=http://elagazat.com/ar/iberotel-luxor-hotel |title=Mideast: Sphinx Avenue Paved With Bitter Memories — Global Issues |publisher=Globalissues.org |date=2011-06-16 |access-date=2011-09-16 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20161109000123/http://elagazat.com/ar/iberotel-luxor-hotel |archive-date=November 9, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

== Infrastructure ==
===Transport===
[[File:Luxor International.JPG|thumb|[[Luxor International Airport]]]]

Luxor is served by [[Luxor International Airport]].

A bridge was opened in 1998, a few kilometres upstream of the main town of Luxor, allowing ready land access from the east bank to the west bank. Traditionally river crossings have been the domain of several ferry services. The so-called 'local ferry' (also known as the 'National Ferry') continues to operate from a landing opposite the Temple of Luxor.

[[File:Luxor Station.jpg|thumb|left|Luxor railway station]]

Transport to sites on the west bank are serviced by taxi drivers who often approach ferry passengers.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} There are also local cars that reach some of the monuments for 2 L.E., although tourists rarely use them. Alternatively, motorboats line both banks of the Nile all day providing a quicker, but more expensive (50 L.E.), crossing to the other side.

The city of Luxor on the east bank has several bus routes used mainly by locals. Tourists often rely on horse carriages, called "calèches", for transport or tours around the city. Taxis are plentiful, and reasonably priced, and since the government has decreed that taxis older than 20 years will not be relicensed, there are many modern air-conditioned cabs. Recently, new roads have been built in the city to cope with the growth in traffic.

For domestic travel along the route of the Nile, a rail service operates several times a day. A morning train and sleeping train can be taken from the railway station situated around {{convert|400|m|yd}} from Luxor Temple. The line runs between several major destinations, including [[Cairo]] to the north and [[Aswan]] to the south.
