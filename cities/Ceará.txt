Ceará has an area of {{convert|148016|km2}}. It is bounded on the north by the [[Atlantic Ocean]], on the east by the states of [[Rio Grande do Norte]] and [[Paraíba]], on the south by [[Pernambuco]] state, and on the west by [[Piauí]].

Ceará lies partly upon the northeast slope of the [[Brazilian Highlands]], and partly upon the sandy coastal plain. Its surface is a succession of great terraces, facing north and northeast, formed by the denudation of the ancient sandstone plateau which once covered this part of the continent; the terraces are seamed by watercourses, and their valleys are broken by hills and ranges of highlands. The latter are the remains of the ancient plateau, capped with horizontal strata of sandstone, with a uniform altitude of {{convert|2000|to|2400|ft}}.  The flat top of such a range is called a ''[[chapada]]'' or ''taboleira'', and its width in places is from {{convert|32|to|56|mi}}. The boundary line with Piauí follows one of these ranges, the [[Serra de Ibiapaba]], which unites with another range on the southern boundary of the state, known as the [[Serra do Araripe]]. Another range, or escarpment, crosses the state from east to west, but is broken into two principal divisions, each having several local names. These ranges are not continuous, the breaking down of the ancient plateau having been irregular and uneven.

The rivers of the state are small and, with one or two exceptions, become completely dry in the dry season. The largest is the [[Jaguaribe River|Jaguaribe]], which flows entirely across the state in a northeast direction.

Ceará has a varied environment, with [[mangrove]]s, ''[[caatinga]]'', [[jungle]], [[scrubland]] and tropical [[forest]]. The higher ranges intercept considerable moisture from the prevailing trade winds, and their flanks and valleys are covered with a [[Caatinga enclaves moist forests|tropical forest]] which is typical of the region, gathering species from tropical forests, [[caatinga]] and [[cerrado]]. The less elevated areas of the plateaus are either thinly wooded or open campo. Most of the region at the lower altitudes is characterized by scrubby forests called ''caatingas'', which is an endemic Brazilian vegetation. The sandy, coastal plain, with a width of {{convert|12|to|18|mi}}, is nearly bare of vegetation, although the coast has many enclaves of ''[[Northeastern Brazil restingas|restingas]]'' (coastal forests) and [[mangroves]].

The soil is, in general, thin and porous and does not retain moisture; consequently, the long dry season turns the country into a barren desert, relieved only by vegetation along the riverways and mountain ranges, and by the hardy, widely distributed [[Copernicia prunifera|carnauba palm]] (''Copernicia cerifera''), which in places forms groves of considerable extent. Some areas in the higher ranges of Serra da Ibiapaba, Serra do Araripe and others are more appropriate for agriculture, as their soil and vegetation are less affected by the dry seasons.

The beaches of the state are a major tourist attraction. Ceará has several famous beaches such as [[Canoa Quebrada]], [[Jericoacoara]], [[Praia de Morro Branco|Morro Branco]], [[Taíba]] and [[Flexeiras]]. The beaches are divided into two groups (in relation to the capital [[Fortaleza]]): Sunset Coast (''Costa do Sol poente'') and Sunrise Coast (''Costa do Sol nascente'').

Ceará lies in one of the few regions of the country that experiences [[earthquake]]s. In 1980 an earthquake measuring 5.8 on the [[Richter scale]] struck near [[Quixeramobim, Ceará|Quixeramobim]] in the center of the state, rattling the city of Fortaleza but causing no injuries.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mild earthquake in Brazil |date=20 November 1980 |work=[[United Press International]] |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1980/11/20/Mild-earthquake-in-Brazil/3715343544400/ |access-date=1 February 2019}}</ref>

===Climate===
[[File:Ceará Köppen.svg|left|thumb|Climate types of Ceará.]]
The climate of Ceará is hot almost all year. The temperature in the state varies from {{convert|22|to|36|C|F}}. The coast is hot and humid, tempered by the cool trade winds; in the more elevated, semi-arid regions it is very hot and dry (often above {{convert|22|C}}, but seldom above {{convert|30|C}}), although the nights are cool. In the higher ranges (Serra da Ibiapaba, Chapada do Araripe and several smaller highlands) the temperatures are cooler and vary from about {{convert|14|to|18|C|F}}. The record minimum temperature registered in Ceará was {{convert|8|C}}, recorded in Jardim, a small city in [[Chapada do Araripe]].

The year is divided into a rainy and dry season, the rains beginning in January to March and lasting until June. The dry season, July to December, is sometimes broken by slight showers in September and October, but these are of slight importance. Sometimes the rains fail altogether, and then a drought (''seca'') ensues, causing famine and pestilence throughout the entire region. The most destructive droughts recorded in the 18th and 19th centuries were those of 1711, 1723, 1777–1778, 1790, 1825, 1844–1845, and [[Grande Seca|1877–1880]], the last-mentioned (known by local people as ''a [[Grande Seca]]'', "the Great Drought") destroying nearly all the livestock in the state, and causing the death through starvation and pestilence of nearly half a million people, or over half the population. Because of the constant risk of droughts, many dams (called ''açudes'') have been built throughout Ceará, the largest of them the [[Açude Castanhão]]. Because of the dams, the [[Jaguaribe River]] no longer dries up completely.

== Paleontology ==
The state contains outcrops of the [[Early Cretaceous]] [[Crato Formation|Crato]] and [[Santana Formation|Santana]] formations. In 2015, the earliest South American [[enantiornithine]] bird was described from the [[Aptian]] sediments of Crato Formation. The animal was named ''[[Cratoavis cearensis]]'', after formation and state’s naming.<ref name=Carvalhoetal2015>{{cite journal|last1=de Souza Carvalho|first1=I.|last2=Novas |first2=F.

The territory of Ceará was originally inhabited by different Indian peoples, such as the Tabajara, Potyguara, Anacés, Kariri, Inhamum, Jucá, Kanindé, Tremembé, Paicaú and others, who had commercial relations with various European people, including the French, before the Portuguese decided to include the area in Brazil.

The first Portuguese plan for settling in Ceará dated from 1534, but the first attempts to settle the territory failed, and the earliest Portuguese settlement was made near the mouth of the Ceará River in 1603, by Pero Coelho de Sousa. He established the fort of São Tiago, but one year later he and his family abandoned Ceará because of a period of drought, a natural phenomenon that periodically afflicts the province, which the Portuguese settlers were ill-equipped to endure.

Portugal wanted to form a military base in Ceará to support the Portuguese operations in the war against the French. The first attempt with [[Pero Coelho de Sousa]], in 1603, was not successful, and the French continued operating from [[Maranhão]] and [[Serra de Ibiapaba|Ibiapaba]], where they had established a base in 1590. The Indians and French formed political and military alliances. In 1607, two Jesuits, Francisco Pinto and Pereira Figueira, arrived in Ceará with a mission to spy in the area of Ibiapaba. In October, that year Francisco Pinto was killed by the Indians and Pereira Filgueira returned with more information about the area and the French and Indian alliance.

In 1612, the French were successfully expelled from Ceará and Maranhão by a military expedition under the command of Portuguese [[Martim Soares Moreno]]. In the same year he constructed the fortress of São Sebastião on the same site as São Tiago, and one year later he left Ceará for Portugal. It was only in 1618 that [[Martim Soares Moreno]] returned to Ceará, and it is from this time that the Portuguese presence dates. This was restricted at first to the area of the Ceará River: [[Martim Soares Moreno]] made an alliance with the Indians of the Potiguara tribe. In 1631, he left Ceará to help the Portuguese against the Dutch in Pernambuco and the fort of São Sebastião lost its importance.

At this time, what is today Brazil was hotly disputed by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and the Portuguese. The area was invaded twice by the Dutch, in 1637 and in 1649. In 1637, the Dutch and the Indians took the Fort of São Sebastião and dominated Ceará. The Dutch expanded their presence in Ceará and made alliances with different Indian tribes. In 1639, [[Georg Marcgrave]] made an expedition in Ceará, but in 1644 the Indians attacked the Dutch Governor of Ceará, [[Gideon Morris]], the Dutch soldiers were killed, and São Sebastião was destroyed.

There were no Europeans in the region between 1644 and 1649, but in 1649, before negotiations with the different Indian tribes, [[Matias Beck]] arrived in Ceará to explore silver mines of [[Maranguape]]. Good-quality silver was not found however. In this period the Dutch built another fort, by the banks of river Pajeú, and named it Fort Schoonenborch after one of their commanders. In 1654, the Dutch were expelled from Brazil; the Portuguese took Schoonenborch, changed its name to Fortaleza de Nossa Senhora de Assunção (The Fortress of Our Lady of the Assumption), and the different Indian tribes that had made alliance with the Dutch had to flee from Portuguese persecution.

In 1661, the Netherlands formally ceded their Brazilian territories to the Portuguese crown, ending conflict in the region. Ceará became a dependency of [[Pernambuco]] in 1680; this relationship lasted until 1799, when the Captaincy of Ceará was made independent.

The fight for Brazilian independence in 1822 was fierce in Ceará, with the area being a rebel stronghold that incurred vicious retribution from loyalists. The captaincy became a province in 1822 under Dom Pedro I.  A revolution followed in 1824, the president of the province was deposed fifteen days after his arrival, and a republic was proclaimed. Internal dissensions immediately broke out, the new president was assassinated, and after a brief reign of terror the province resumed its allegiance to the empire.

Ceará became the first province of Brazil to abolish slavery, on March 25, 1884, more than four years before the 1888 national law of abolition, passed by Princess Isabel.

The reign of [[Dom Pedro II]] (see [[Empire of Brazil]]) saw great advances in [[infrastructure]] in Ceará, with the commerce increasing by a large amount, and with [[natural gas|gas]] lighting becoming almost ubiquitous.

The state of Ceará became a bishopric of the Roman Catholic Church in 1853, the bishop residing at Fortaleza.

Two railway lines running inland from the coast (the Baturité line from Fortaleza to Senador Pompeu, {{convert|179|mi|km}}, and the Sobral line from the port of Camocim to Ipu, 134 miles), were built by the national government after the drought of 1877–1878 to give work to the starving refugees, and were later operated under leases.  Dams were also built for irrigation purposes.

The population numbered 805,687 in 1890, and 849,127 in 1900. In 1900, approximately five-sixths of the population lived on estates, owned no property, paid no taxes, and derived few benefits from the social and political institutions about them. Education was then confined almost exclusively to the upper classes, from which came some of the most prominent men in Brazilian politics and literature.

In the early 20th century the sandy zone along the coast was nearly barren, but the more elevated region behind the coast with broken surfaces and sandy soil produced fruit and most tropical products when conditions were favourable. The natural vegetable production was important, and included manigoba or Ceará rubber, carnahuba wax and fibre, cashew wine and ipecacuanha. The principal agricultural products were cotton, coffee, sugar, manioc and tropical fruits. The production of cotton increased largely with the development of cotton manufacture in Brazil.

The higher plateau was devoted almost exclusively to cattle raising, once the principal industry of the state, although recurring droughts created an obstacle to its profitable development. The state exported considerable amounts of cattle, hides and skins.

Since 1960, the [[Orós Dam]], comparable in size to the [[Aswan Dam]] has supplied Ceará with much of its water, and in 1995 construction began on the enormous [[Castanhão Dam]], completed in 2003, which is able to hold 6.5&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> of water.

Religion is very important in the culture of Ceará, being an extremely important factor in the construction of the identity of the people. [[Catholicism]] is the [[hegemony]] religion in Ceará and is the Christian confession that left most marks in Ceara's culture. It was the only one recognized by the government until 1883, when the Presbyterian Church of Fortaleza was founded in the state capital.<ref>Anuário do Ceará 2007, p. 387</ref> Roman Catholicism in Ceará presents several influences of indigenous beliefs. A large portion of traditional Christian manifestations in Ceará are strongly influenced by religious syncretism.<ref>Anuário do Ceará 2007, p. 388</ref>

Throughout the 20th century, several churches were installed in the State and at the end of that century there was a considerable increase in people from other religions. However, Ceará is still the third Brazilian state with the highest proportion of Roman Catholics, 78.8% of the population, according to data from 2010 census. Evangelicals are 14.6%, Spiritists, 0.6%, members of other religions, 2.0%, and those without religion, 4.0%.<ref>«[https://www.ibge.gov.br/estadosat/index.php Censo 2010]».

Traditionally an [[agriculture]]-based state, Ceará began an [[industrialisation]] program under the [[military regime]] (1964–1985), and the industrial sector continues to expand annually. In 1999, [[Industrial sector|industry]] accounted for 39.3% of the state's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. Tourism also plays a large role in Ceará's economy, with the state's many [[waterfall]]s, [[beach]]es and [[rainforest]]s. On average, [[Fortaleza]] alone receives half a million tourists annually.

In agriculture, the state stands out in the production of [[cashew nuts]], [[coconut]], [[papaya]], [[melon]] and [[beans]].
[[File:CAJU.JPG|thumb|Cashew in Ceará]]
The production of [[cashew]] in Brazil is carried out almost exclusively in the Northeast. The area occupied by cashew trees in Brazil in 2017 was estimated at 505,500 ha; of this total, 99.5% is located in the Northeast. The main producers in this region are Ceará (61.6% of the national area), Rio Grande do Norte and Piauí. However, Brazil, which in 2011 was the fifth largest world producer of cashew nuts, in 2016, fell to 14th position, with 1.5% of the total volume of nuts produced in the world. Vietnam, Nigeria, India and Côte d'Ivoire were the world's largest cashew nut producers in 2016, with 70.6% of global production. In recent years, there has been increased competition with some African countries, where government programs have driven the expansion of culture and processing capacity. It is estimated that at 295 thousand tons per year the installed capacity for processing cashew nuts in the Northeast, however, the Region only managed to produce around a quarter of that quantity. Among the main world producers, Brazil has the lowest productivity. Several factors are pointed out as the cause of the low productivity and the fall in the Brazilian production of cashew nuts. One reason is that most orchards are in a phase of natural decline in production. In addition, the giant cashew trees, which are the majority in the Region, are exploited in an almost extractive manner, with low use of technology.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bnb.gov.br/documents/80223/4141162/54_caju.pdf/95e65093-50e1-b48d-ab01-15f3a8f690b4 |title=CAJUCULTURA NORDESTINA EM RECUPERAÇÃO |access-date=2020-07-26 |archive-date=2020-09-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200917060950/https://www.bnb.gov.br/documents/80223/4141162/54_caju.pdf/95e65093-50e1-b48d-ab01-15f3a8f690b4 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2017, the Northeast Region was the largest producer of [[coconut]] in the country, with 74.0% of national production. Bahia produced 351 million fruits, Sergipe, 234 million, and Ceará 187 million. However, the sector has been suffering strong competition and losing market to Indonesia, the Philippines and India, the world's largest producers, who even export coconut water to Brazil. In addition to climatic problems, the low productivity of coconut palms in the Northeast Region is the result of factors related to the variety of coconut harvested and the technological level used in coastal regions. In these areas, the semi-extractive cultivation system still prevails, with low fertility and without the adoption of cultural management practices. The three states that have the largest production, Bahia, Sergipe and Ceará, present a yield three times lower than that of Pernambuco, which is in 5th place in the national production. This is because most of the coconut trees in these three states are located in coastal areas and cultivated in semi-extractivist systems.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bnb.gov.br/documents/80223/4296541/61_coco.pdf/c172dd8f-3044-f1db-5d0c-a94c5eb735e0 |title=PRODUÇÃO DE COCO: O NORDESTE É DESTAQUE NACIONAL |access-date=2020-07-26 |archive-date=2020-06-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200628161559/https://www.bnb.gov.br/documents/80223/4296541/61_coco.pdf/c172dd8f-3044-f1db-5d0c-a94c5eb735e0 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
