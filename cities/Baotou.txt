Steel was a major industry in the city. Today, Baotou refines over half of the rare-earth minerals produced in the world. This has led to environmental contamination near the industrial sites.

==History==
[[File:Baotou.jpg|thumb|200px|The Deer monument in central Baotou City, Inner Mongolia]]

===Ancient times===
The area now known as Baotou was inhabited by nomads, some of whose descendants would later be categorized as Mongols. Near the end of the [[Han dynasty]]—206 BC–220 AD—[[Lü Bu]], a particularly noteworthy warrior, was born in today's [[Jiuyuan District]] of Baotou.

===Foundation of the town===
Compared to the capital of Inner Mongolia, [[Hohhot]], Baotou's construction as a city came relatively late, being incorporated as a town in 1809. The city's site was chosen because it was in an arable region of the [[Yellow River]]'s Great Bend.

===Early 20th century===

The [[Gelaohui]] secret society and the [[Hui people|Hui Muslim]] General [[Ma Fuxiang]] came to an agreement in 1922, in which Ma Fuxiang agreed to allow the Gelaohui to extort protection money from wool merchants in Baotou.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Millward |first= James A. |title= THE CHINESE BORDER WOOL TRADE OF 1880-1937 |url= https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:ryPtj5bHAyIJ:www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/millwarj/website%2520images/LONGWOOL.doc+ma+fuxiang+tibet+mongolia+china+life+death&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESgPNJ9zBBcZ0j4BIpmRtSi0aNr0pZV-A9qa-fSzQD9EuagJbpxGk6GF1CPaSiWr9YMY_37vx53-O4XPXIWOazgjgDYcuLwkAyaKhB-mDyW90o8LnFMZHYL2HVPpNomy1CBw7PKB&sig=AHIEtbSJHqDltQOHYstyVS83PFSI0aEz4A|page= 38 |access-date=10 July 2014}}</ref>

A railway from Beijing was constructed in 1923, and the city began spurring some industrial sites. A German-Chinese joint-venture in 1934 constructed the [[Baotou Airport]] and opened a weekly route connecting Baotou with [[Ningxia]] and [[Lanzhou]].

When young [[Owen Lattimore]] visited Baotou in 1925, it was still "a little husk of a town in a great hollow shell of mud ramparts, where two busy streets made a traders' quarter", but already an important railhead. [[Qinghai]] and [[Gansu]] wool and hides were brought down the [[Yellow River]] by raft and boat from [[Lanzhou]] to Baotou, and shipped from Baotou by rail to the east (in particular, to [[Tianjin]] for export). The river traffic was one-way only, however, as the fast current made sailing up the Yellow River impractical. To travel from Baotou back to Lanzhou or [[Yinchuan]], one would use a cart and camel road. There were also caravan roads from Baotou to [[Ordos (city)|Ordos]] and the [[Alxa League]].<ref>[[Owen Lattimore]], ''The Desert to Turkestan'', 1928. Pages 7-8.</ref>

The earthquake, which destroyed many old houses, led to the reconstruction of Baotou.

Baotou features a cold [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSk''), marked by long, cold and very dry winters, hot, somewhat humid summers, and strong winds, especially in spring. Temperatures often fall below {{convert|−15|°C|0}} in winter and rise above {{convert|30|°C}} in summer. The annual precipitation is approximately {{convert|300|mm|in|1}}, with more than half of it falling in July and August alone. Due to the aridity and elevation, temperature differences between day and night can be large, especially in spring. In 2002, there were 12 instances of [[dust storm]]s.<ref name = "Geo"/> Temperature extremes recorded since 1951 range from {{convert|-31.4|°C|0}} (though an unofficial record low of {{convert|-32.8|°C|0}} on 23 December 1935)<ref>{{Cite web |last=网易 |date=2018-12-08 |title=这两天根本不算冷 看看全国各大城市历史极端最低温度是几度？ |url=https://www.163.com/dy/article/E2HHPSS305444WQP.html |access-date=2024-09-15 |website=www.163.com}}</ref> to {{convert|40.4|°C|0}}.
