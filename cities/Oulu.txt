It is located on the northwestern coast of the country at the mouth of the [[Oulujoki|River Oulu]]. The population of Oulu is approximately {{formatnum:{{#expr:{{Data Finland municipality/population count|{{PAGENAME}}}}round -3}}}}, while the [[Oulu sub-region|sub-region]] has a population of approximately {{formatnum: {{#expr: {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Oulu}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Hailuoto}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Kempele}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Liminka}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Lumijoki}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Muhos}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Tyrnävä}}round −3}}}}.

==Etymology==
The city is named after the river [[Oulujoki]], which originates in the lake [[Oulujärvi]]. There have been a number of other theories for the origin of the name ''Oulu''. One possible source is a word in the [[Sami languages|Sami language]] meaning 'flood water', but there are other suggestions. At minimum, the structure of the word requires that, if originally given by speakers of a [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language, the name must be a [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivative]]. In all likelihood, it also predates Finnish settlement and is thus a [[loanword]] from one of the now-extinct [[Sami languages|Saami languages]] once spoken in the area.

The most probable theory is that the name derives from the Finnish dialectal word ''oulu'', meaning "[[floodwater]]", which is related to e.g. [[Southern Sami language|Southern Sami]] ''åulo'', meaning "melted snow", ''åulot'' meaning "thaw" (of unknown ultimate origin). Two other word families have also been speculated to be related. The first is seen in the Northern Savo dialectal word ''uula'' and its Sami counterpart ''oalli'', both meaning "river channel". The second is the Uralic root [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] as *''uwa'', meaning "river bed" (reflected as ''vuo'' in modern Finnish, also in derivatives such as ''vuolas'' "heavy-flowing"). To either of these roots, some Sami variety would have to be assumed having added further derivational suffixes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kaino.kotus.fi/www/verkkojulkaisut/julk125/oulunsalo/oulun_etymologia.shtml |title=Oulu-nimen etymologia |publisher=Kotimaisten kielten tutkimuskeskus |access-date=2011-09-16}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Oulu1800.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of central Oulu from the 19th century]]
Oulu is situated by the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], at the mouth of river [[Oulujoki]], which is an ancient trading site. 

Following the [[Treaty of Nöteborg]] in 1323, the status of Oulu was disputed in its ownership, as both the [[Novgorod Republic]] and the [[Kingdom of Sweden (800–1521)|Kingdom of Sweden]] held much influence. In 1345, the Kingdom of Sweden annexed territory up to the [[Kemi River]] for the [[Archdiocese of Turku|Diocese of Turku]]. In 1375, the Novgorod Republic built a defensive castle which was later captured by the [[Kingdom of Sweden (800–1521)|Kingdom of Sweden]] in 1377.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |url=https://finna.fi/Record/arto.007343896?sid=4728088626 |title=Valkean kaupungin vaiheet: Oulun historiaa |date=1987 |publisher=Pohjois-Suomen historiallinen yhdistys |isbn=978-951-95473-4-3 |editor-last=Fält |editor-first=Olavi K. |series=Studia historica septentrionalia |location=; Rovaniemi |editor-last2=Juvani |editor-first2=Pertti |editor-last3=Kenttä |editor-first3=Risto |editor-last4=Julku |editor-first4=Kyösti |editor-last5=Paavola |editor-first5=Kirsti |editor-last6=Vahtola |editor-first6=Jouko |editor-last7=Satokangas |editor-first7=Reija |editor-last8=Mäkelä |editor-first8=Riitta |editor-last9=Siuruainen |editor-first9=Eino}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Oulu sat img.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of the Oulu region.]]
Oulu is located in northern Finland, a considerable distance from the other cities in the country. It is located {{convert|607|km}} north of the capital city [[Helsinki]]. Mainland Finland's northernmost and southernmost points are roughly [[equidistant]] from Oulu. Oulu's coast sits at the [[Bothnian Bay]] (''Perämeri'' in Finnish) and the [[Sweden|Swedish mainland]] is about 180&nbsp;km directly west across the Bothnian Bay. From the center of Oulu in the direction of [[Oulunsalo]], there is {{ill|Kempeleenlahti|fi|Kempeleenlahti}}, a smaller but wide, [[meadow]]-belted bay,<ref>[https://fi.geoview.info/kempeleenlahti,653251 Kempeleenlahti Bay, Oulu, Finland]</ref> and part of it has been listed as a nature [[conservation area]].<ref>[https://www.ouka.fi/oulu/ymparisto-ja-luonto/kempeleenlahti1 Kempeleenlahden suojelualue] (in Finnish)</ref> The nearby island [[Hailuoto]] is just off the coast, {{convert|53|km}} away in the Bothnian Bay. Along the coast to the southwest, about {{convert|75|km}} of Oulu is [[Raahe]] (''Brahestad''), known for its historic wooden town, and, further to the southwest, about {{convert|130|km}} of Oulu is [[Kalajoki]], known for its popular sandy beaches.

===Subdivisions===
{{Category see also|Districts of Oulu}}
[[File:Map of Oulu in 1886.jpg|thumb|The map of Oulu from 1886.]]
Oulu is divided into 106 city districts. The largest of these are [[Haukipudas]], [[Oulunsalo]], [[Kaakkuri]], [[Ritaharju]], [[Tuira, Oulu|Tuira]], and {{ill|Kello, Oulu|lt=Kello|fi|Kello (kaupunginosa)}}.

The municipality of [[Ylikiiminki]] was merged with the city of Oulu on 1 January 2009. Oulu and the municipalities of [[Haukipudas]], [[Kiiminki]], [[Oulunsalo]], and [[Yli-Ii]] were merged on 1 January 2013.<ref name="uusioulu">{{cite web|title=Uusi Oulu|url=http://www.ouka.fi/uusioulu/|publisher=City of Oulu|access-date=19 September 2011|location=Oulu|language=fi|trans-title=New Oulu | date=9 September 2011}}</ref>

===Climate===
Oulu has a [[subarctic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfc'', [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]] ''Eolo''), bordering a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfb'', Trewartha ''Dclo''). It is the largest [[Finnish cities|Finnish city]] entirely in this climatic zone as well as one of the largest such in the world. The typical features are cold and snowy winters with short and mild summers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=57820&cityname=Oulu,+Northern+Ostrobothnia,+Finland&units=|title=Oulu, Finland Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZM9DwAAQBAJ&q=despite+the+subarctic+climate+oulu&pg=PT41|title=Learn Finnish – Level 5: Advanced: Volume 1: Lessons 1–25|publisher=Innovative Language Learning|language=fi}}</ref> Average annual temperature is {{convert|3.3|°C}}. The average annual precipitation is {{convert|477|mm|2|abbr=on}} falling 105 days per year, mostly in late summer and fall.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} The warmest temperature ever recorded in Oulu was {{convert|33.3|C}} in July 1957,<ref>{{cite book |title=Ilmatieteellinen Keskuslaitos: Suomen meteorologinen vuosikirja, osa 1a 1957}}</ref> while the coldest temperature on record was {{convert|-41.5|C}} in February 1966.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ilmatieteellinen Keskuslaitos:Suomen meteorologinen vuosikirja, osa 1a 1966}}</ref>

Due to Oulu's far northern location, and its frequent overcast skies, it only sees on average 15 minutes of sunshine per day in December. During the [[winter solstice]] days only last 3 hours and 34 minutes with the sun rising 1.9 degrees over the horizon. On the other hand, during the [[summer solstice]] days last 22 hours and 3 minutes, with the sun dipping 1 degree below the horizon. This gives Oulu [[White Night festivals|white nights]] during the summer.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sunrise and sunset times in Oulu |url=https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/finland/oulu |access-date=2022-03-12 |website=www.timeanddate.com |language=en}}</ref>

Even in winter, bicycle commuting remains strong in Oulu, in spite of the cold, dark, and snow. About 12% of winter trips are by bicycle, and about half of trips to school or university are. The city has a robust system for keeping bike paths maintained and clear of snow, and bike paths and lanes are plowed before roadways to encourage such human-scale winter transit in the city where 12% already do so.<ref>Laurel Ives.

The parking facility includes two ramps, 900 visitor parking lots (expandable to 1500), six access points to the ground served by 19 elevators (expandable to nine and 25), a service facility for commercial delivery vehicles, and [[Ubiquitous computing|ubi]]-screens that guide the driver to the selected ground access point and help locate the parked car by its license number.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oulunliikekeskus.fi/parking |title=Oulun Liikekeskus – Parking |access-date=2016-03-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310085459/http://www.oulunliikekeskus.fi/parking |archive-date=2016-03-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sito.fi/en/2014/08/kivisydan-parking-facility-in-oulu/|title=Kivisydän parking facility in Oulu|website=Oulunliikekeskus.fi|access-date=24 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310073910/http://www.sito.fi/en/2014/08/kivisydan-parking-facility-in-oulu/|archive-date=2016-03-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Solar power ==
In 2015, the [[Kaleva (newspaper)|Kaleva Media]] printing plant in Oulu became the most powerful photovoltaic solar plant in Finland, with 1,604 solar photovoltaic (PV) units on its roof. Although the city of Oulu, located near the [[Arctic Circle]], has only two hours of weak sunlight in December, the photovoltaic cells work almost around the clock in the summer. The cold climate means the PV panels can get up to a 25% boost per hour, as they don't overheat.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://insideclimatenews.org/news/22022020/solar-finland-nordic-renewables-sanna-marin-climate-targets-turku|title=Solar Power Just Miles from the Arctic Circle?

Because the sun is quite low in the sky at this latitude, vertical PV installations are popular on the sides of buildings. These solar walls also capture light reflected from snow.<ref name=":0" />

Snow is not necessarily cleared from rooftop solar installations.<ref name=":0" />

The local utility, Oulun Energia, is owned by the city of Oulu. The [[energy mix]] it receives from the Nordic-wide grid includes wood pellets, waste incineration, bioenergy, hydro-electric, geothermal, wind, nuclear, peat, natural gas and coal.<ref name=":0" />
