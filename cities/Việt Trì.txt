==Transport and Transportation==
Việt Trì's prime responsibility is as an industrial city, due to being located near the confluence of three rivers. The city laid the groundwork for a roots festival in 2015, so in recent years it has undergone infrastructure investment to make sure the it is of fairly uniform construction. Many roads are being renovated, boasting upgrades and new construction to standardized inner city roads to always ensure smooth traffic. Transportation of goods across motorways, railways and rivers is also fairly convenient. National routes 2 and 32 are important for transportation from Việt Trì city to other cities and provinces in Vietnam. In 2012, Việt Trì was designated a class 1 provincial city according to Vietnam's "City Classification Criteria".
