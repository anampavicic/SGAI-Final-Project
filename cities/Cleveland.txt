[[File:Moses Cleaveland statue in 2021.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[James G. C. Hamilton]]'s 1888 statue of city founder General [[Moses Cleaveland]]]]
Cleveland was established on July 22, 1796, by surveyors of the [[Connecticut Land Company]] when they laid out [[Connecticut]]'s [[Connecticut Western Reserve|Western Reserve]] into townships and a capital city. They named the settlement "Cleaveland" after their leader, General [[Moses Cleaveland]], a veteran of the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref name="moses">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Cleaveland, Moses |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher=Case Western Reserve University |url=https://case.edu/ech/articles/c/cleaveland-moses |access-date=August 21, 2019 |date=January 20, 2019}}</ref> Cleaveland oversaw the [[New England]]–style design of the plan for what would become the modern downtown area, centered on [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]], before returning to Connecticut, never again to visit Ohio.<ref name="moses" /> The town's name was often shortened to "Cleveland", even by Cleaveland's original surveyors. A common myth emerged that the spelling was altered by ''The Cleveland Advertiser'' in order to fit the name on the newspaper's [[Nameplate (publishing)|masthead]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Burton|first=Abby|title=CLE Myths: The "A" In Cleaveland|magazine=[[Cleveland Magazine]]|url=https://clevelandmagazine.com/in-the-cle/articles/cle-myths-the-a-in-cleaveland|date=November 25, 2019|access-date=May 20, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Bourne |first=Henry E. |year=1896 |title=The Story of Cleveland |magazine=New England Magazine |volume=14 |issue=6 |page=744 |quote=It was agreeable to the wishes of many of our oldest and most intelligent citizens, who are of the opinion that the 'a' is superfluous. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Og7AQAAMAAJ&q=%22Cleveland%20Advertiser%22%201831%20spelling&pg=PA744}}</ref>

In spite of the nearby swampy lowlands and harsh winters, the town's waterfront location proved to be an advantage, giving it access to Great Lakes trade. It grew rapidly after the 1832 completion of the [[Ohio and Erie Canal]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ohio and Erie Canal |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher=Case Western Reserve University |url=https://case.edu/ech/articles/o/ohio-and-erie-canal |access-date=August 5, 2019 |date=February 7, 2019}}</ref> This key link between the [[Ohio River]] and the [[Great Lakes]] connected Cleveland to the Atlantic Ocean via the [[Erie Canal]] and Hudson River, and later via the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]].<ref name="economy" /> The town's growth continued with added [[Rail transportation in the United States|railroad links]].{{sfn|Miller|Wheeler|1997|p=[https://archive.org/details/clevelandconcise0000mill/page/51 51]}} In 1836, Cleveland, then only on the eastern banks of the Cuyahoga, was officially incorporated as a city, and [[John W.

=== Growth and expansion ===
The Civil War vaulted Cleveland into the first rank of American manufacturing cities and fueled unprecedented growth.{{sfn|Miller|Wheeler|1997|p=[https://archive.org/details/clevelandconcise0000mill/page/69 69]}} Its prime geographic location as a transportation hub on the Great Lakes played an important role in its development as an industrial and commercial center. In 1870, [[John D.

Several neighborhoods have begun to attract the return of the middle class that left the city for the suburbs in the 1960s and 1970s. These neighborhoods are on both the West Side (Ohio City, Tremont, Detroit–Shoreway, and Edgewater) and the East Side (Collinwood, Hough, Fairfax, and Little Italy).

Typical of the [[Great Lakes region]], Cleveland exhibits a [[continental climate]] with four distinct seasons, which lies in the [[humid continental]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa'')<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kottek |first1=Marcus |last2=Greiser |first2=Jürgen |last3=Beck |first3=Christoph |last4=Rudolf |first4=Bruno |last5=Rubel |first5=Franz |display-authors=2 |title=World Map of Köppen – Geiger Climate Classification |url=https://opus.bibliothek.uni-augsburg.de/opus4/files/40083/metz_Vol_15_No_3_p259-263_World_Map_of_the_Koppen_Geiger_climate_classification_updated_55034.pdf |journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift |volume=15 |issue=3 |page=261 |date=June 2006 |doi=10.1127/0941-2948/2006/0130|bibcode=2006MetZe..15..259K  | issn = 0941-2948}}</ref> zone. The climate is transitional with the ''Cfa'' [[humid subtropical climate]]. Summers are hot and humid, while winters are cold and snowy. East of the mouth of the Cuyahoga, the land elevation rises rapidly in the south. Together with the prevailing winds off Lake Erie, this feature is the principal contributor to the [[lake-effect snow]] that is typical in Cleveland (especially on the city's East Side) from mid-November until the surface of the lake freezes, usually in late January or early February. The lake effect causes a relative differential in geographical snowfall totals across the city. On the city's far West Side, the Hopkins neighborhood only reached {{convert|100|in|cm|0}} of snowfall in a season three times since record-keeping for snow began in 1893.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cleveland Snowfall Statistics|publisher=[[National Weather Service]]|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/cle/climate/cle/records/cletop10snow.html|access-date=May 19, 2023}}</ref> By contrast, seasonal totals approaching or exceeding {{convert|100|in|cm|0}} are not uncommon as the city ascends into the Heights on the east, where the region known as the "[[Snowbelt|Snow Belt]]" begins. Extending from the city's East Side and its suburbs, the Snow Belt reaches up the Lake Erie shore as far as [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Mark |title=Where is Northern Ohio's Snow Belt? |website=[[WEWS-TV]] |url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/weather/weather_news/where-is-northern-ohio's-snow-belt |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922040750/http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/weather/weather_news/where-is-northern-ohio%27s-snow-belt |access-date=January 20, 2013 |archive-date=September 22, 2013}}</ref>
