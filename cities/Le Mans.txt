'''Le Mans''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|_|ˈ|m|ɒ̃}}, {{IPA|fr|lə mɑ̃|lang|Fr-Paris--Le Mans.ogg}}) is a [[Communes of France|city]] in Northwestern [[France]] on the [[Sarthe (river)|Sarthe River]] where it meets the [[Huisne]]. Traditionally the capital of the [[Provinces of France|province]] of [[Maine (province)|Maine]], it is now the capital of the [[Sarthe]] [[Departments of France|department]] and the seat of the Roman Catholic [[diocese of Le Mans]]. Le Mans is a part of the [[Pays de la Loire]] [[Regions of France|region]].

Its inhabitants are called ''Manceaux'' (male) and ''Mancelles'' (female). Since 1923, the city has hosted the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], the world's oldest active endurance sports car race. The event is among the most attended and [[Triple Crown of Motorsport|prestigious motor sports events]] in the world.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Le Mans}}

First mentioned by [[Claudius Ptolemy]],<ref>''Geography'' 2.8.8</ref> the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] city ''Vindinium'' was the capital of the [[Aulerci]], a sub tribe of the [[Aedui]]. Le Mans is also known as ''Civitas Cenomanorum'' (City of the [[Aulerci Cenomani|Cenomani]]), or ''Cenomanus''. Their city, seized by the Romans in 47 BC, was within the ancient [[Roman province]] of [[Gallia Lugdunensis]]. A 3rd-century [[amphitheatre]] is still visible. The ''[[thermae]]'' were demolished during the [[Crisis of the Third Century|crisis of the third century]] when workers were mobilized to build the city's defensive walls. The ancient wall around Le Mans is one of the most complete circuits of [[Gallo-Roman]] city walls to survive.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Butler |first1=R. M. |date=1958 |title=The Roman Walls of le Mans |journal=The Journal of Roman Studies |volume=48 |issue=1/2 |pages=33–39 |doi=10.2307/298210 |jstor=298210 |s2cid=162544388 }}</ref>

As the use of the French language replaced late [[Vulgar Latin]] in the area, ''Cenomanus'', with [[dissimilation]], became known as ''Celmins.'' ''Cel-'' was taken to be a form of the French word for "this" and "that", and was replaced by ''le'', which means "the".

As the principal city of [[Maine (province of France)|Maine]], Le Mans was the stage for struggles in the eleventh century between the counts of [[County of Anjou|Anjou]] and the dukes of [[Normandy]]. When the Normans had control of Maine, [[William the Conqueror]] successfully invaded England and established an occupation. In 1069 the citizens of Maine revolted and expelled the Normans, resulting in [[Hugh V of Maine|Hugh V]] being proclaimed [[List of Counts and Dukes of Maine|count of Maine]]. [[Geoffrey V of Anjou]] married [[Matilda of England]] in the [[Le Mans Cathedral|cathedral]]. Their son [[Henry II of England|Henry II Plantagenet, king of England]], was born in the town.<ref>{{Cite book |last=King |first=Edmund |title=King Stephen |date=2010 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-11223-8 |location=New Haven, Connecticut, United States |page=37}}</ref>

In the 13th century Le Mans came under the control of the French crown.  It was subsequently invaded by England during the [[Hundred Years' War]].<ref name="britannica.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Le-Mans|title = Le Mans &#124; History, Geography, & Points of Interest &#124; Britannica| date=11 June 2023 }}</ref>

Industrialization took place in the 19th century which saw the development of railway and motor vehicle production as well as textiles and tobacco manufacture.<ref name="britannica.com"/>

[[Wilbur Wright]] began official public demonstrations of the airplane he had developed with his younger brother [[Orville Wright|Orville]] on 8 August 1908, at the Hunaudières horse racing track near Le Mans.<ref name="hc">{{cite book |last1=Combs |first1=Harry |title=Kill Devil Hill: Discovering the Secret of the Wright Brothers |date=1979 |publisher=TernStyle Press, Ltd. |location=Englewood |isbn=0940053020 |pages=266–281}}</ref>

===World War II===
Soon after Le Mans was liberated by the U.S. [[79th Infantry Division (United States)|79th]] and [[90th Infantry Division (United States)|90th]] Infantry Divisions on 8 August 1944,<ref>Blumenson, Martin, ''Breakout and Pursuit'', Center of Military History, United States Army, Washington, D.C., 1989, pp. 436–8</ref> engineers of the [[Ninth Air Force]] IX Engineering Command began construction of a combat [[Advanced Landing Ground]] outside of the town. The airfield was declared operational on 3 September and designated as "[[Le Mans Airfield|A-35]]". It was used by several American fighter and transport units until late November of that year in additional offensives across France; the airfield was closed.<ref>Johnson, David C.

==Transportation==
The [[Gare du Mans]] is the main railway station of Le Mans. It takes 1 hour to reach Paris from Le Mans by [[TGV]] high speed train. There are also TGV connections to Lille, Marseille, Nantes, Rennes and Brest. Gare du Mans is also a hub for regional trains. Le Mans inaugurated a new [[Le Mans tramway|light rail system]] on 17 November 2007.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view//le-mans-light-rail-takes-off.html | title=Le Mans light rail takes off | date=6 January 2008 | magazine=[[Railway Gazette International]] | access-date=5 March 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616040209/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/le-mans-light-rail-takes-off.html | archive-date=16 June 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Sport==
===Motorsport===

[[File:Empreinte pilotes 24h.jpg|thumbnail|right|Handprints and signatures from the winners of the 1992 edition of the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], [[Mark Blundell]], [[Derek Warwick]], and [[Yannick Dalmas]], at Le Mans]]

The first [[French Grand Prix]] took place on a 64-mile (103&nbsp;km) circuit based at Le Mans [[1906 French Grand Prix|in 1906.]]

Since the 1920s, the city has been best known for its connection with motorsports. There are two official and separate racing tracks at Le Mans, though they share certain portions. The smaller is the [[Circuit de la Sarthe#Bugatti Circuit|Bugatti Circuit]] (named after [[Ettore Bugatti]], founder of the [[Bugatti|car company]] bearing his name), a relatively short permanent circuit, which is used for racing throughout the year and regularly hosts the [[French motorcycle Grand Prix]]. The longer and more famous [[Circuit de la Sarthe]] is composed partly of public roads. These are closed to the public when the track is in use for racing. Since 1923, this route has been used for the famous [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] [[Sports car racing|sports car endurance race]]. Boutiques and shops are set up during the race, selling merchandise and promoting products for cars.

The "[[Le Mans start]]" was formerly used in the 24-hour race: drivers lined up across the track from their cars, ran across the track, jumped into their cars and started them to begin the race.

The [[1955 Le Mans disaster]] was a large accident during the race that killed eighty-four spectators.

===Basketball===
The city is home to [[Le Mans Sarthe Basket]], 2006 Champion of the [[LNB Pro A]], France's top professional basketball division.

The team plays its home games at the [[Antarès]], which served as one of the host arenas of the FIBA [[EuroBasket 1999]].
