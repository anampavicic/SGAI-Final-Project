Together with [[Wolfsburg]] and Braunschweig, Salzgitter is one of the seven ''Oberzentren'' of Lower Saxony (roughly equivalent to a [[metropolitan area]]). With 101,079 inhabitants and {{convert|223.92|km2|2|abbr=out}} (as of 31 December 2015), its [[area]] is the largest in Lower Saxony and one of the largest in [[Germany]]. Salzgitter originated as a conglomeration of several small towns and villages, and is today made up of 31 boroughs, which are relatively compact conurbations with wide stretches of open country between them. The main shopping street of the young city is in the borough of Lebenstedt, and the [[central business district]] is in the borough of Salzgitter-Bad. The city is connected to the [[Mittellandkanal]] and the [[Elbe Lateral Canal]] by a [[distributary]]. The nearest [[metropolis]]es are Braunschweig, about {{convert|23|km|abbr=off}} to the northeast, and [[Hanover]], about {{convert|51|km|abbr=in}} to the northwest. The [[population]] of the City of Salzgitter has exceeded 100,000 inhabitants since its foundation in 1942 (which made it a city ({{lang|de|Großstadt}}) in contrast to a [[town]] ({{lang|de|Stadt}}) by the German definition), when it was still called ''Watenstedt-Salzgitter''. Beside Wolfsburg, [[Leverkusen]] and [[Eisenhüttenstadt]], Salzgitter is one of the few cities in Germany founded during the 20th century.

==Name==
Until 31 March 1942, "Salzgitter" was the name of a town where the borough [[Salzgitter-Bad]] now is. From then until 1951, "Salzgitter" was the name of a borough of the city Watenstedt-Salzgitter that existed at the time. In 1951, the borough Salzgitter was renamed Salzgitter-Bad; the name Salzgitter, having thus been freed up, became the new and more succinct name of the city that had been called "Watenstedt-Salzgitter" until then. (Nowadays, "Salzgitter-Watenstedt" is the name of a small borough with a few hundred inhabitants.)<ref>[http://www.salzgitter.de/stadtleben/kultur/stadtgeschichte/salz.php salzgitter.de – history of the name (German)]</ref>

==Geography==
Salzgitter is located in a wide dell coated with [[loess]], between the Oderwald Forest and the Salzgitter-Höhenzug ("Salzgitter Hills"). The city stretches up to {{convert|24|km|abbr=on}} from north to south and up to {{convert|19|km|abbr=on}} from east to west. The highest point is the hill Hamberg ({{convert|275|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}), located northwest of Salzgitter-Bad.

===Neighbouring municipalities===

==History==
===1300–1982===
Salzgitter originated in the beginning of the 14th century around salt springs near the village Verpstedt (later Vöppstedt). The name was derived from the neighbouring village Gitter (nowadays a city borough) as "up dem solte to Gytere", which means "salt near Gitter"; the first mention was in 1347. After 200 years of salt production at various springs, the [[peasant]]s in the area which is nowadays Salzgitter were chartered around 1350, but lost municipal law again when being transferred to the [[Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] in the beginning of the 16th century. Later, Salzgitter belonged to the [[Bishopric of Hildesheim|diocese of Hildesheim]]. When the diocese was transferred to [[Prussia]] in 1803, the municipal law was reconfirmed, but taken away once more in 1815, when Salzgitter became part of the [[Kingdom of Hanover]]. In 1830, a brine bath was established in Salzgitter.

After the Kingdom of Hanover was transferred to Prussia in 1866, Salzgitter became a Prussian municipality, which was chartered again in 1929. Prior to that, the towns Vorsalz and Liebenhall had been incorporated (in 1926 and 1928, respectively). Salzgitter now belonged to the [[Landkreis]] (district) of Goslar and included, apart from Salzgitter itself, also some small settlements like Gittertor, which is nowadays part of Salzgitter-Bad. In 1936, Kniestedt was incorporated; it is also part of Salzgitter-Bad now.

[[File:KZ-Außenlager Salzgitter-Drütte Gedenkstätte Hochstraße 2010-04-11.jpg|thumb|left|Salzgitter-Drütte concentration camp memorial]]
Due to the large [[iron ore]] body in Salzgitter, which had been mentioned first in 1310, the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialists]] founded the "[[Reichswerke Hermann Göring]]" for ore mining and [[ironworks|iron production]] in 1937. In order to facilitate an unobstructed development of the smelting works, a unique [[Administration (government)|administration]] structure in the whole area was conceived. Therefore, it was decreed in the ''Order about the area settlement around the Hermann-Göring-Werke Salzgitter'', effective from 1 April 1942, to form a unified city district ([[independent city]]). Towards this aim, the town of Salzgitter and the municipalities Beinum, Flachstöckheim, Groß-Mahner, Hohenrode, Ohlendorf and Ringelheim (7 in total, all belonging to the [[Goslar (district)|Landkreis Goslar]]) and Barum, Beddingen, Bleckenstedt, Bruchmachtersen, Calbecht, Drütte, Engelnstedt, Engerode, Gebhardshagen, Hallendorf, Heerte, Immendorf, Lebenstedt, Lesse, Lichtenberg, Lobmachtersen, Osterlinde, Reppner, Salder, Thiede-Steterburg (nowadays simply Thiede) and Watenstedt (21 in total, all belonging to the [[Wolfenbüttel (district)|Landkreis Wolfenbüttel]]) were merged to form the ''Stadtkreis Watenstedt-Salzgitter''. As the neighbouring municipality Gitter had already been incorporated in 1938, the young city initially comprised 29 boroughs in 1942. Together with the remainder of the district of Goslar, the new independent municipality was integrated into the [[Free State of Brunswick]]. In return, Braunschweig transferred the [[Holzminden (district)|Landkreis Holzminden]] to the Prussian [[Province of Hanover]]. In October, 1942, the [[SS]] established the Drütte concentration camp, a subcamp of the [[Neuengamme concentration camp]], to provide [[slave labour]] for the Hermann Göring Works.<ref>United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, ''Holocaust Encyclopedia.'' [http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?ModuleId=10005539 Neuengamme]. Accessed 18 April 2007.</ref> This large subcamp held 2,800 inmates. There were three concentration camps located in Salzgitter. During the war, Salzgitter was severely damaged by several [[United States|American]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] [[bombing]]s. After the war, the State of Braunschweig became part of the [[States of Germany|Land]] [[Lower Saxony]], and Watenstedt-Salzgitter became an Independent City in the "Administrative District of Braunschweig" (later [[Regierungsbezirk]] [[Braunschweig (region)|Braunschweig]]).

[[File:Grube Gitter-Georg - Schacht Georg - Totalansicht 1961.jpg|thumb|Georg mine in Salzgitter in 1961]]
In 1951, the city was renamed to "Stadt Salzgitter" (City of Salzgitter), while the borough Salzgitter was renamed to "Salzgitter-Bad", referring to the brine bath there. In the course of the local administrative reform of Lower-Saxony effective from 1 March 1974, the municipalities Üfingen and Sauingen (formerly Landkreis Wolfenbüttel) were incorporated, increasing the number of boroughs to 31. Iron ore continued to be mined in Salzgitter until 1982; in the former [[mining|mine]] ''[[Konrad mine|Schacht Konrad]]'' (Konrad mine), an [[Deep geological repository|ultimate disposal place]] for [[radioactive waste]] has been planned since 1975.

==Religions==
The area of the modern city of Salzgitter originally pertained to the [[Bishopric of Hildesheim|diocese of Hildesheim]]. In 1568, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was established in Salzgitter, and two [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical)|ecclesiastical superintendencies]] came into existence: the southern part of the area of the modern city, the Superintendency of Salzgitter, pertained to the [[Province of Hanover]] and thus ecclesiastically to the [[Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover]] (and, within it, to the [[Consistory (Protestantism)|Consistory of Hildesheim]]); the northern part (the Superintendency of Lebenstedt), however, belonged to the [[Free State of Brunswick]] and therefore to the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Brunswick|Evangelical Lutheran State Church in Brunswick]].

When the city of Watenstedt-Salzgitter was created in 1942, the entire area was attached to the state of Brunswick both politically and [[ecclesiastic]]ally. Thus, all parishes of Salzgitter now belong to the Church of Brunswick. The two superintendencies are called ''Propstei'' ([[provost (religion)|provostry]]) today, and both the ''Propsteien'' Salzgitter-Bad and Salzgitter-Lebenstedt comprise additional [[parish]]es which are not within the city of Salzgitter.

Roman Catholics who after the Reformation moved into the city belonged, as in the [[Middle Ages]], to the [[diocese of Hildesheim]], which established a separate [[deanery]] in Salzgitter. All Roman Catholic parishes of the city now pertain to that deanery.

Besides the two major denominations, there are congregations in Salzgitter which belong to [[free church]]es. These include a [[Baptist]] parish, the [[Church of God (Anderson, Indiana)|Church of God]], [[Plymouth Brethren]], and the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], as well as several [[New Apostolic Church]]es.

Due to the [[immigration]] of foreign workers during the 1970s, there are some [[Islam]]ic [[mosque]]s. According to calculations based on census data, Salzgitter in 2011 had the highest proportion of Muslim migrants of all major cities in Lower Saxony.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kartenseite.wordpress.com/2017/03/27/muslime-in-niedersachsen-gemeinden/ |title=Kartenseite: Muslime in Niedersachsen – Gemeinden |publisher=kartenseite.wordpress.com |date=2017-03-27 |access-date=2017-05-14}}</ref>

==Politics==
After the creation of Salzgitter a state commissar was set in place as provisional Mayer of the city of Watenstedt-Salzgitter. After [[World War II]], the military government of the [[British Occupation zone of Germany|British zone of occupation]] installed the communal [[constitution]] of [[UK|Britain]]. Furthermore, there is an elected Council in place. The Council elects one of its members to [[Mayor]] (German: ''Oberbürgermeister'') as leader and representative of the city. Besides, since 1946 on there was the ''Oberstadtdirektor'' as the Chief Executive of the City Council. Since 2001, the office of the leader of the Council and the Chief Executive are merged into one, simply called Mayor. Being elected by the people, the Mayor represents the city and leads the Council.

==Coat of arms==
[[File: DEU Salzgitter COA.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|Coat of arms of the city of Salzgitter]]
Salzgitter's [[Coat of Arms]] consists of a silver [[Metallurgical furnace|furnace]] visible behind a silver [[pinnacle]] wall on which there is a [[buckler]] whose upper ground is green and adorned with two saltern instruments and whose lower ground is gold and adorned with a black sledge and black iron. On the red ground behind the furnace, there are two [[wheat]]en ears.

The Coat of Arms stands for the [[agriculture]], which is important for many villages of Salzgitter, on the one hand, and for the [[Industry (economics)|industry]], which led to Salzgitter's foundation, on the other hand.

This Coat of Arms is from 1951. Before, Watenstedt-Salzgitter had got a different one. Also the former town Salzgitter had got various coats of arms from 1854 on.

Like many German cities, Salzgitter has used the city's logo for some years. It is a green field with a white snaking way that narrows towards the [[horizon]].

==Transport==

===Road===
In the north of Salzgitter, there is an [[Autobahn]] (A 39) from Braunschweig to the [[Interchange (road)|interchange]] Salzgitter (where it is possible change to Autobahn 7 Kassel-Hanover). Salzgitter has got five [[Grade separation|grade-separated]] interchanges to this Autobahn. East from Salzgitter, there is the Autobahn 395 (Braunschweig-[[Goslar]]), which can be reached from Salzgitter by four interchanges.<br/>
Moreover, two [[highways]] go through Salzgitter.

===Railway===
Salzgitter has six [[railway station]]s. The most important one is in the quarter [[Salzgitter-Ringelheim]], the most central one in Salzgitter-Lebenstedt. There is no ''Hauptbahnhof'' (main railway station) in Salzgitter. Salzgitter-Ringelheim's station is located on the [[Halle (Saale)]]-Goslar-Salzgitter-Hildesheim-Hanover line. Another line leads into the [[Harz]] Mountains and to Braunschweig, passing [[Salzgitter-Bad]]. Salzgitter-Lebenstedt is the end of a local line coming from Braunschweig and passing the other train stops of Salzgitter.

===Public transport===
There are three bus companies in Salzgitter. The bus network is quite important considering Salzgitter consists of many spread-out villages.

==Economy and infrastructure==
===Media===
In Salzgitter, the daily [[newspaper]] ''[[Braunschweiger Zeitung|Salzgitter-Zeitung]]'' and the Sunday newspaper ''Salzgitter-Woche am Sonntag'' are published.
