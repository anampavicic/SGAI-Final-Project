{{nihongo|'''Yamaguchi Prefecture'''|山口県|Yamaguchi-ken}} is a [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] of [[Japan]] located in the [[Chūgoku region]] of [[Honshu]].<ref>Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Yamaguchi-ken" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', pp. 1039-1040|page=1039}}; "Chūgoku" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 127|page=127}}.</ref> Yamaguchi Prefecture has a population of 1,377,631 (1 February 2018) and has a geographic area of 6,112 [[Square kilometre|km<sup>2</sup>]] (2,359 [[Square mile|sq mi]]). Yamaguchi Prefecture borders [[Shimane Prefecture]] to the north and [[Hiroshima Prefecture]] to the northeast.

[[Yamaguchi (city)|Yamaguchi]] is the capital and [[Shimonoseki]] is the largest city of Yamaguchi Prefecture, with other major cities including [[Ube, Yamaguchi|Ube]], [[Shūnan]], and [[Iwakuni]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Yamaguchi" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 1039|page=1039}}.</ref> Yamaguchi Prefecture is located at the western tip of Honshu with coastlines on the [[Sea of Japan]] and [[Seto Inland Sea]], and separated from the island of [[Kyushu]] by the [[Kanmon Straits]].

== History ==
{{See also|List of Historic Sites of Japan (Yamaguchi)}}

Yamaguchi Prefecture was created by the merger of the provinces of [[Suō Province|Suō]] and [[Nagato Province|Nagato]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 780|page=780}}.</ref> During the rise of the [[samurai]] class during the [[Heian period|Heian]] and [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]] Periods (794–1333), the Ouchi family of Suō Province and the Koto family of Nagato Province gained influence as powerful warrior clans. In the [[Muromachi period]] (1336—1573), [[Ouchi Hiroyo]], the 24th ruler of the Ouchi family conquered both areas of Yamaguchi Prefecture. The Ouchi clan imitated the city planning of [[Kyoto]]. They gained great wealth through cultural imports from the continent and trade with [[Korea]] and [[Ming Dynasty]] China. As a result, Yamaguchi came to be known as the "Kyoto of the West," and Ouchi culture flourished. [[Sue Harutaka]] defeated the 31st ruler of the Ouchi clan. The Sue clan was then defeated by [[Mōri Motonari]], and the Mōri family gained control of the [[Chūgoku region]]. Yamaguchi was ruled as part of the [[Mōri clan]] domain during the [[Sengoku period]]. [[Mōri Terumoto]] was then defeated by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] in the battle of [[Sekigahara]] in 1600. He was forced to give up all his land except for the Suō and Nagato areas (current-day Yamaguchi Prefecture), where he built his castle in [[Hagi, Yamaguchi|Hagi]]. Mōri sought to strengthen the economic base of the region and increase local production with his Three Whites campaign (salt, rice, and paper).

After Commodore [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Matthew Perry]]'s [[Perry Expedition|opening of Japan]], clans from Nagato (also called [[Chōshū Domain|Chōshū]]) played a key role in the fall of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] and the establishment of the new imperial government.
Four years after the [[Edo Shogunate]] was overthrown and the [[Meiji government]] formed in 1868, the present Yamaguchi Prefecture was established. The Meiji government brought in many new systems and modern policies, and promoted the introduction of modern industry, though the prefecture was still centered on agriculture during this period. In the [[Taishō period]], from 1912 to 1926, shipbuilding, chemical, machinery, and metal working plants were built in Yamaguchi's harbors in the [[Seto Inland Sea]] area. During the post-World War II [[Shōwa Period]], Yamaguchi developed into one of the most industrialized prefectures in the country due to the establishment of petrochemical complexes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pref.yamaguchi.lg.jp/foreign/english/history.html |title=The History of Yamaguchi Prefecture |access-date=2009-02-16 |archive-date=2013-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519013055/http://www.pref.yamaguchi.lg.jp/foreign/english/history.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Geography ==
As of April 1, 2012, 7% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as [[List of national parks of Japan#History|Natural Parks]], namely the [[Setonaikai National Park]]; [[Akiyoshidai Quasi-National Park|Akiyoshidai]], [[Kita-Nagato Kaigan Quasi-National Park|Kita-Nagato Kaigan]], and [[Nishi-Chugoku Sanchi Quasi-National Park|Nishi-Chūgoku Sanchi]] Quasi-National Parks; and [[Chōmonkyō Prefectural Natural Park|Chōmonkyō]], [[Iwakiyama Prefectural Natural Park|Iwakiyama]], [[Rakanzan Prefectural Natural Park|Rakanzan]], and [[Toyota Prefectural Natural Park|Toyota]] Prefectural Natural Parks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/nps/park/doc/files/np_6.pdf |title=General overview of area figures for Natural Parks by prefecture |publisher=[[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] |access-date=1 September 2012}}</ref>

==Economic development==
For the purposes of development analysis, Yamaguchi is construed to be part of [[Northern Kyushu]]. Although Yamaguchi is not part of the island of [[Kyushu]], it has become a functional satellite of the [[Kanmon Straits]] metropolitan area.<ref>Sakamoto, Hiroshi. (2011).

== Tourism ==
The most popular place for tourism is [[Shimonoseki]], which has the [[Karato]] Fish Market and a large fireworks festival in summer.

Another attraction is the [[Kintai Bridge]] in the town of [[Iwakuni]]. This five-arched wooden structure is considered a symbol of Western Honshū. The area on the banks of the Nishiki river close to the bridge is considered among the best places in Japan for [[Hanami]], when groups of family and friends gather in early April to view cherry blossoms.

[[Hagi, Yamaguchi|Hagi City]] is in the north of Yamaguchi. It is a very traditional city. The usual color of Japanese post boxes is red, but in Hagi they are painted green or brown. The Hagi Museum is modeled after a traditional samurai residence. The exhibits are detailed and realistic, and are changed every year. The permanent collection is data about Hagi's history and collections about [[Takasugi Shinsaku]]. Hagi also contains a [[reverberatory furnace]] which has been designated a World Heritage Site.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hagishi.com/en/world-heritage/|title=HAGI Sightseeing Guide|website=Burari HAGI aruki_HAGI Sightseeing Guide|access-date=2016-05-31}}</ref>

Kawara soba (hot tile noodles) is a popular dish in Yamaguchi. It was developed during the [[Satsuma Rebellion|Seinan Rebellion]] when soldiers cooked wild grass and meat on hot tiles. Today people in Yamaguchi create this dish by frying green tea noodles on a hot tile, and arranging a thin fried egg, stewed beef, green onions, and grilled liver on top. 

[[Akiyoshidai Quasi-National Park]], which includes Japan's longest cave, the {{nihongo|Akiyoshido|秋芳洞}}, is another popular destination.

==Politics==
Since the [[Meiji Restoration]] in which lower-rank nobility from [[Chōshū Domain|Chōshū]] played a major role, many politicians from Yamaguchi have held important positions in national politics. In the post-war era, the most prominent political family from Yamaguchi is the [[Nobusuke Kishi|Kishi]]-[[Shintarō Abe|Abe]]/[[Eisaku Satō|Satō]] prime ministerial dynasty, and Yamaguchi is leaning solidly towards the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP).

=== Delegation to the National Diet ===
Since the electoral reform of the 1990s, Yamaguchi elects four members directly to the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]]. Three of the new single-member districts have been held exclusively by Liberal Democrats as of 2013, the easternmost district bordering [[Hiroshima Prefecture|Hiroshima]] was initially won by [[Shinji Satō]] (Eisaku Satō's son) in 1996, but went to [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1996)|Democrat]] [[Hideo Hiraoka]] in several later elections.
