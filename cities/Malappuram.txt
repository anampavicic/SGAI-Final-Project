== History ==

Malappuram was a military and administrative headquarters from ancient times, though several of the ancient history of the city is hardly seen recorded. However, there are some pre-historic relics, particularly Rock-cut caves found in some parts of the city like Oorakam, Melmuri, [[Ponmala]], Vengara etc. manifesting the inhabitancy.<ref name=History_of_Malappuram>{{cite web |url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/3205_PART_A_MALAPPURAM.pdf |website=censusindia.gov.in |title= History of Malappuram}}</ref> Locality named like Valiyangadi, Kootilangadi, Pallipuram etc. points to the Jain - Buddhist history of Malappuram. Notably, the 1500-year-old Jain Temple above 2000&nbsp;ft sea level at [[Oorakam Hill]] of Malappuram undoubtedly proves the same.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpreecenvis.nic.in/Database/OorakamMala_2713.aspx|title=Oorakam Mala|website=www.cpreecenvis.nic.in|access-date=24 August 2019}}</ref> During the [[Sangam period]], Eranadan Malappuram was under the Chera Empire. Places like Pattar Kadav, Panakkad, etc. are possibly evolved out of Pattars and Panars having lived there. But no further details are available about the life and culture of the people either during the Sangam age or in the post-Sangam age.<ref name="DISTRICT CENSUS HANDBOOK">{{Cite book|title=DISTRICT CENSUS HANDBOOK|publisher=DIRECTORATE OF CENSUS OPERATIONS, KERALA|year=2011|pages=15}}</ref>

[[Eranad]] was ruled by a [[Samanthan Nair]] clan known as [[Eradi]]s, similar to the [[M. K. Vellodi|Vellodi]]s of neighbouring [[Kingdom of Valluvanad|Valluvanad]] and [[Nedungadi]]s of [[Ottapalam|Nedunganad]]. The rulers of Eranad were known by the title ''Eralppad''/''Eradi''. Archaeological relics found in Malappuram also include the remnants of palaces of the eastern branch of the Zamorin reign. Malappuram was the military headquarters of the Zamorin in the Eranad region. The Zamorins held sway over Malappuram and their chieftain Para Nambi, ruled the area in early days with headquarters at Downhill (Kottappadi), Malappuram.<ref name="Malabar Manual Appendix">{{cite book |last1=Logan |first1=William |title=MALABAR MANUAL: With Commentary by VED from VICTORIA INSTITUTIONS |publisher=VICTORIA INSTITUTIONS, Aaradhana, DEVERKOVIL 673508 |edition=Volume 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0TJFDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1 |access-date=12 July 2020}}</ref> Details of the rulers of erstwhile Malappuram, who were the ancestors of later Zamorins, figure in the Jewish copper plates of Bhaskara Ravi Varman (1000 AD) and in the Kottayam copper plates of Veera Raghava Chakravarthy (1225 AD).

===Kottakkunnu Hill station ===
{{Main|Kottakkunnu}}
Kottakkunnu Hill station located in the middle of Malappuram city. Also known as The Hill station of Malappuram. many entertainment centers like art gallery, amusement park, children's park etc... have been built there.
The name Kottakunnu comes from the fort built here when the area was the military headquarters of the [[Calicut]] rulers [[Zamorins]]. Due to the geographical importance of this area, the fort known as Malappuram Fort was built here and the city of Malappuram came up.

== Geography ==
===Topography===
Malappuram is situated in the mid land area of the state. As the name suggests, it is covered with small mountains of lush greenery, bonded with several freshwater streams flowing through the city. Kadalundi Puzha, a major river in Kerala is flowing around the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://malappuram.nic.in/about-district/|title=Malappuram District Profile|website=Malappuram}}</ref> Malappuram is one of the few municipalities in the state with a tremendous track record of keeping the city clean.

===Climate===
The city has more or less the same climatic conditions prevalent elsewhere in Kerala: a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Am'') that is generally hot and humid in nature. However, the South West Monsoon is usually very heavy. The best season to visit Malappuram is during the months of September to March as the weather conditions are quite pleasant. Owing to its natural habitat, Malappuram is also a city of fresh air. According to the Central Pollution Control Board data for the year 2010, of the 180 cities monitored for SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>, Malappuram was one of the two cities which met the criteria of low pollution (i.e. 50% below the standard) for all air pollutants.
