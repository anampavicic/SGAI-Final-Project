It is the home to [[agribusiness]] farms such as Watania Farms,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://watania-agri.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207101357/http://watania-agri.com/|url-status=dead|title=الوطنية الزراعية القابضة – إحدى شركات وقف الشيخ سليمان الراجحي وتعد أحد أبرز المعالم الداعمة للإقتصاد الوطني.|archivedate=February 7, 2011}}</ref> the largest organic farm in the kingdom. The fertile agricultural land of Al-Jawf is due largely to underground water, which drew delegates of King Abdul Aziz. They were sent to the town of Sakaka and [[Dumat Al-Jandal]] and [[Qurayyat, Saudi Arabia|Qurayat]], requesting resident tribes there to join the nascent kingdom. Sakaka is home to many Saudi families that can proudly trace their lineage to a few large, old tribes that have dominated the area since time immemorial.
