'''San Juan de la Maguana''' is a city and municipality in the western region of the [[Dominican Republic]] and capital of the [[San Juan Province (Dominican Republic)|San Juan province]]. It was one of the first cities established on the island; founded in 1503, and was given the name of San Juan de la Maguana by San Juan Bautista and the [[Taino]] name of the valley: Maguana. The term Maguana means "the first stone, the unique stone".<ref>{{Cite web |title=ayuntamientosanjuan.gob.do/historia |url=https://ayuntamientosanjuan.gob.do/historia/ |website=ayuntamientosanjuan.gob.do}}</ref>

==Geography==
San Juan de la Maguana is in the center of Valley of San Juan with the Central ("Cordillera Central") mountain range to the north and east, and the Sierra de Neiba to the south. To the west there is a range of low hills. The San Juan River is the main river of the region, and the city was founded on the eastern side of this river.

==History==
San Juan de la Maguana is one of the oldest cities in the country
. It occupies the same valley where the chiefdom seat had Maguana and the historic "Corral of the Indians". Their leader and warlord was [[Caonabo]] (which in the aboriginal language means "great lord of the earth"), he this chief led one of the most notable battles against the Spanish colonizers.

[[Alonso de Ojeda]] captured Caonabo in a ruse.  Caonabo's town later became the site of San Juan de la Maguana, founded by Rodrigo Mejia Trillo.<ref name="Floyd">{{cite book|last1=Floyd|first1=Troy|title=The Columbus Dynasty in the Caribbean, 1492-1526|date=1973|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|pages=28–29, 63}}</ref>

San Juan de la Maguana was founded in 1503 by Diego Velázquez.<ref>Vidal, Pedro Luciano Vergés.

Starting in the late 17th century, the San Juan valley began to be inhabited again by colonists from other settlements in the colony and the Canary islands. In 1733, the town of San Juan was founded once more, close to the site of the original settlement. The town grew steadily during the 18th century, with a population of 1,851 according to a census done in 1777; of them, 1,223 were free and 618 were enslaved. Like many towns in the region at the time, the primary economic activity was cattle ranching. The town exported hundreds of cattle to the neighboring French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]], surpassed in volume only by the towns of Hincha (now part of [[Haiti]] as [[Hinche]]) and [[El Seibo]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hernández González|first1=Manuel|date=2005|title=La colonización de la frontera dominicana (1680-1795)|trans-title=The colonization of the Dominican border (1680-1795)|language=Spanish|publisher=Ediciones IDEA|pages=256–261|isbn=84-96505-34-0}}

San Juan was temporarily ruled by the French when the Spanish colony was ceded to France under the [[Peace of Basel]] in 1795. It returned to Spanish jurisdiction in 1809 following the [[Spanish reconquest of Santo Domingo]]. In 1820, president [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]] of Haiti sent Dézir Dalmassi to San Juan and other cities to amass support for the incoming annexation. In 1821, San Juan became part of the short-lived [[Republic of Spanish Haiti]], which would later be annexed by the [[Republic of Haiti (1820–1849)]] the following year.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Peguero|first1=Valentina|last2=de los Santos|first2=Danilo|date=1983|title=Vision general de la historia Dominicana|trans-title=Overview of Dominican History|language=Spanish|publisher=Editora Corripio, C. por A.|location=Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic|pages=131–155}}</ref> During this time, the city was known as Saint-Jean de la Maguâna and was part of the department of Ozama in the Haitian state.

The eastern part of Hispaniola declared independence as the Dominican Republic on February 27, 1844, and San Juan became part of the province of Azua. Haitian forces would attempt to recapture the east in a 12 year war; one of these battles, the [[Battle of Santomé]], took place close to San Juan. Dominican forces prevailed and San Juan and surrounding areas remained a part of the Dominican Republic.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Peguero|first1=Valentina|last2=de los Santos|first2=Danilo|date=1983|title=Vision general de la historia Dominicana|trans-title=Overview of Dominican History|language=Spanish|publisher=Editora Corripio, C. por A.|location=Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic|pages=179–207}}</ref>

Since its inception San Juan flourished due to its fertile lands and climate. a diverse range of fruits were grown in the town; the exploitation of sugarcane as a commercial item of importance, were the main line for the employment of labor. San Juan possessed in principle four "mills" for the exploitation of cane. The first of these mills was installed in the center of town.
