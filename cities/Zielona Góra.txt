'''Zielona Góra''' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: {{IPA|pl|ʑɛˈlɔna ˈɡura|lang|Pl-Zielona Góra.ogg}}; {{literal translation}} ''Green Mountain''; {{langx|de|link=no|Grünberg in Schlesien}}) is the largest city in [[Lubusz Voivodeship]], located in western [[Poland]], with 140,403 inhabitants ({{as of|alt=2021|2021}}).<ref name="population" /> The region is closely associated with [[vineyards]] and holds an annual [[Zielona Góra Wine Fest|Wine Fest]].<ref name="weisswasser.de">{{cite web|url=http://www.weisswasser.de/sites/default/files/print_pdf/zielona_gora_okolice_14_07_14.pdf|title=Zielona Góra and surrounding areas: Brochure|website=Weisswasser,de|access-date=29 December 2018}}</ref> Zielona Góra is one of the two capital cities of Lubusz Voivodeship, hosting the [[Voivodeship sejmik|province's elected assembly]], while the seat of the centrally appointed [[voivode|governor]] is in the city of [[Gorzów Wielkopolski]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.staypoland.com/about_zielona-gora.htm|title=Zielona Gora – Tourism – Tourist Information – Zielona Gora, Poland -|first=StayPoland Sp. z|last=o.o.|website=Staypoland.com|access-date=24 September 2017}}</ref>

In 1222 Duke [[Henry the Bearded]] from the [[Piast dynasty]] brought the first settlers to the area.<ref name="weisswasser.de"/> In 1323 Zielona Góra was granted [[town privileges]]. The town was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] in 1506 and became part of the [[Habsburg monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] in 1526. It experienced a wave of [[witch trials]] in the 17th century. As a result of the [[First Silesian War]], the city became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1742. It then was part of the [[North German Confederation]] and the [[German Reich]] until the end of [[World War II]] in 1945,<ref name="weisswasser.de"/> when it became again part of Poland.

==Toponymy==
In the [[Silesian language]], the city is called ''Źelůno Gůra'' (in [[Silesian language#Writing system|Steuer's Silesian alphabet]]) or ''Grinberg''; using the [[Silesian language#Writing system|Silesian primer alphabet]]: ''Zielōnŏ Gōra'' or ''Grinberg''; in [[Silesian German]], the city was called ''Grienberg''.

In the 16th century, pseudo-historical Latin names appeared for the city, such as ''Prasia Elysiorum'' and ''Thalloris''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://repozytorium.uni.wroc.pl/Content/78843/PDF/06_Cezary_Lipinski_Silesia_issues_of_language_and_ethnicity.pdf | title=Silesia – issues of language and ethnicity in the long 16th century | first=Cezary | last=Lipiński | work=[[University of Zielona Góra]] }}</ref><ref>Tomasz Kamusella, ''The Dynamics of the Policies of Ethnic Cleansing in Silesia in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries''.

==History==
===Middle Ages===
[[File:Wieża GłodowaZG.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Medieval Łazienna Gate]]
The first settlement in the area of Zielona Góra was built in the valley near the Złota Łącza stream during the reign of the Polish ruler [[Mieszko I]].<ref name="ZG">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.today/20070812041204/http://www.zielona-gora.pl/umzg/index.php?id=185&lng=pl|title=Zielona Góra - Internetowy Serwis Miejski|date=August 12, 2007|website=archive.ph}}</ref> The oldest settlement was agricultural. It later developed into a trading point along routes from [[Poznań]] to [[Żagań]] and further to [[Lusatia]].<ref name="ZG"/> The written records of the Slavic settlement date to 1222 and an increase of its population by [[Henry the Bearded]].<ref name="ZG"/> Other documents date the settlement to 1302.<ref name="W164">Weczerka, p. 164</ref>

The region received an influx of [[Germans|German]] burghers in the second half of the 13th century during the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]].<ref>Westermann, p. 74</ref> In 1323, the settlement became a city with ''Crossener Recht'', a variation of [[Magdeburg rights]].<ref name="W164"/> The earliest mention of the town's coat of arms is from 1421, although it is believed to have been arranged since the beginning of the 14th century.<ref name="H154">Hupp, p. 154</ref> A document in the town archive of [[Toruń|Thorn (Toruń)]] dating from before 1400 used a [[Seal (device)|sigil]] with the name ''GRVNINBERG'', an early form of the German name ''Grünberg''.<ref name="H154"/>

In 1294, Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Głogów|Henryk III]] of the [[Duchy of Głogów]], founded a church in honour of [[Hedwig of Andechs|Saint Hedwig]], the High Duchess consort of Poland and patron saint of Silesia. Now designated a co-cathedral, it is the oldest building in the city. A wooden castle near the city, built ca. 1272, was the residence of Duke [[John, Duke of Ścinawa|John of Ścinawa]] from 1358 to 1365. Janusz had ceded his lands to Duke [[Henry V of Iron]].<ref name="W165">Weczerka, p. 165</ref> In 1477 the town defeated a 5,000-strong army from neighbouring [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] which attempted to seize it during the succession war to the Duchy of Głogów. In 1488, Duke [[Jan II the Mad|John II of Żagań]], destroyed the castle to prevent his enemies from using it.<ref name="W165"/>

The deposition of Duke [[Jan II the Mad|John II of Żagań]] in 1488 marked the end of the long rule of the [[Piast dynasty]] in the Duchy of Głogów and the city of Zielona Góra. Later on, the duchy was ruled by the future Kings of Poland [[John I Albert]] and [[Sigismund I the Old]]. It was integrated with the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] in 1506,<ref name=pwn>{{cite web|url=https://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo/Zielona-Gora;4001413.html|title=Zielona Góra|website=Encyklopedia PWN|access-date=7 February 2020|language=pl}}</ref> although Polish king Sigismund I the Old still claimed his rights to the city in 1508.<ref name=GL/>

===Early modern period===
The city flourished during the reign of Sigismund I the Old. In 1505 Sigismund issued a [[privilege (law)|privilege]] allowing the sale of cloth products from Zielona Góra throughout [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]].<ref>Stanisław J. Kozłowski, ''Zielona Góra. Baza ekonomiczna i powiązania zewnętrzne'', [[Ossolineum|Zakład Narodowy im. Ossolińskich]], Wrocław, 1977, p. 13</ref> In 1641, King [[Władysław IV Vasa]] of Poland confirmed these rights.<ref name=GL>{{cite web |url=https://gazetalubuska.pl/historia-zielonej-gory-i-slaska-kalendarium/ar/7366372|title=Historia Zielonej Góry i Śląska – kalendarium, "Gazeta Lubuska"|date=29 August 2007 |access-date=June 12, 2019|language=pl}}</ref> Another important branch of the city's economy at this time was [[winemaking]].<ref>Stanisław J. Kozłowski, ''Zielona Góra. Baza ekonomiczna i powiązania zewnętrzne'', Zakład Narodowy im. Ossolińskich, Wrocław, 1977, p. 14</ref>

[[File:Zg1740.GIF|thumb|220px|A panorama of the city in the mid-18th century]]
The city converted to [[Lutheranism]] during the [[Protestant Reformation]] through the efforts of Paul Lemberg, Abbot of Sagan.<ref name="W166">Weczerka, p. 166</ref> The city declined during the 17th century, especially during the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648) and following decades. Grünberg endured plundering, debts, emigration of burghers, and fires.<ref name="W166"/> In 1651 during the [[Counter Reformation]], the [[Habsburg monarchy]] of Austria reintroduced [[Roman Catholicism]] and suppressed [[Protestantism]].<ref name="W165"/>

The city was subjected to heavy [[Germanisation]] and German craftsmen banned Poles from attending any practice allowing them to work as members of guilds.<ref name="ZG"/> A rebellion caused by conscription ended with many Poles being imprisoned.<ref name="ZG"/> From 1640, [[Witch-hunt|witch trials]] took place, the number of which increased significantly in 1663–1665.<ref name=GL/> As a result, in 1669 the local court was deprived of the right to impose the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] on women accused of witchcraft.<ref name=GL/>

The city was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] by the 1742 [[Treaty of Breslau]] which ended the [[First Silesian War]]. The Prussians introduced [[religious toleration]],<ref name="W166"/> leading to the construction of the Protestant parish church ''Zum Garten Christ'' from 1746 to 1747.<ref name="W166"/> Catholic Poles were later discriminated against, however. In 1758, during the [[Seven Years' War]], [[prisoners of war|POWs]] brought the [[plague (disease)|plague]] to the city.<ref name=GL/>

===Late modern period===
The city's [[textile industry]] was booming by the end of the 1700s. By 1800, large parts of the city walls had been dismantled to allow the city to expand.<ref name="W166"/> The textile industry suffered during the 1820s while adjusting to the [[Industrial Revolution]] and an import ban by the [[Russian Empire]]. The city's economy began to recover after many clothiers emigrated to [[Congress Poland]]. English industrialists were among the 19th-century economic reformers of Grünberg.<ref name=GL/>

[[File:Zielona Góra, Filharmonia (1).jpg|thumb|The Zielona Góra Philharmonic]]

During industrialisation, many Germans from the countryside moved to large industrial cities and a large number of Poles came to German cities to work as well. The Polish population was pushed by [[Germanisation of Poles during the Partitions|Germanisation]] to rural villages,<ref name="ZG"/> although some remained in the town contributed to the economic revival of the city.<ref name="ZG"/> A Polish church remained functional<ref name="ZG"/> until 1809 and a Polish craftsmen association (''Towarzystwo Polskich Rzemieślników'') was established by Kazimierz Lisowski in 1898;<ref name=ZZ>''Znani zielonogórzanie'', Verbum, Zielona Góra, 1996, p. 124</ref> it existed till 1935 when Lisowski was murdered by the [[Gestapo]]. In 1923 a branch of the [[Union of Poles in Germany]] was established.<ref name=ZZ/> In 1932 the German authorities did not allow the establishment of a Polish school.<ref name=ZZ/>

Since 1816 after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Grünberg was administered within the district ''Landkreis Grünberg'' in the [[Province of Silesia]]. In 1871 it became part of the [[German Empire]] during the [[unification of Germany]]. English industrialists purchased some of the city's textile factories during the 1870s and 1880s.<ref name="W166"/> By 1885, most of Grünberg's population of 14,396 were Protestants.<ref>''[[Meyers Konversations-Lexikon]]'', 1885</ref> The city was first connected to the Glogau ([[Głogów]])-Grünberg-[[Guben]] railway line in 1871, followed by connections to Christianstadt ([[Nowogród Bobrzański]]) in 1904, Wollstein ([[Wolsztyn]]) in 1905, and a local line to Sprottau ([[Szprotawa]]) in 1911.<ref name="W166"/>

[[File:Pomnik Bohaterów II WŚ Zielona Góra.jpg|thumb|upright|World War II memorial]]
In 1919, Grünberg became part of the [[Province of Lower Silesia]] within [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]]. On 1 April 1922 it became a district-free city. This status was revoked on 1 October 1933 while part of [[Nazi Germany]]. During the ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' in 1938, the Germans destroyed the synagogue.<ref name=GL/> During [[World War II]] the Germans operated 42 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] camps in armaments production in the city, intended initially for Polish men and women, and later also Russians, Ukrainians, Britons, [[French prisoners of war in World War II|French]] and [[Italian Military Internees|Italians]].<ref name=at/> There were also three subcamps of the [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp]] within the modern city limits for Jewish men and women.<ref name=at>{{cite journal|last=Toczewski|first=Andrzej|year=2017|title=Filie obozów koncentracyjnych na Środkowym Nadodrzu|journal=Ziemia Lubuska|location=Zielona Góra|language=pl|volume=3|pages=109–110, 113–114, 125–126|issn=2450-3355}}</ref> In January 1945, a German-perpetrated [[Death marches during the Holocaust|death march]] of Jewish women from [[Sława]] reached the city, and the remaining prisoners were also sent on death marches westwards.<ref name=at/>

On February 11, 1945, the authorities of Zielona Góra, then still Grünberg, received a report about Russians in the vicinity of [[Nowa Sól]]. Wehrmacht soldiers and civilians organizing defense in cities were threatened with being cut off from the south-west. In this situation, the preparations of Zielona Góra for defense by regular troops were interrupted. On February 11 the [[Yalta Conference]] ended and it was not known exactly what would happen to Zielona Góra. On February 12 the most important German offices and management boards of larger enterprises were evacuated beyond [[Lusatian Neisse|Nysa Łużycka]].<ref name=chajewski/>

On February 13 other residents were encouraged to leave the city through [[megaphone]]s. The last train left in the evening. One of the previously sent transports was hit by an English air attack in [[Dresden]] and, according to some, about 900 inhabitants of Zielona Góra died at the local railway station. On 14 February. Hitler's ardent supporters called on the [[Hitler Youth]] to defend themselves. Previously, the so-called [[Sonderkommando]], which from the morning started blowing up strategic objects and immobilizing various technical devices, e.g. power plants, gas plants and waterworks.<ref name=chajewski/>

The defenders set up two machine guns on the Branibor Hill. Having heard about the imminent threat from Nowa Sól, they withdrew to the city center. On the other hand, the supporters of a quick surrender, including the worker Alfred Kuntzel, the Nazi Friedrich Brucks and the communist Karl Laube formed a surrender committee.<ref name=chajewski>{{cite web|url=https://gazetalubuska.pl/14-lutego-rosjanie-wkroczyli-do-grunberga-w-zielonej-gorze-obylo-sie-bez-walki/ar/c15-15441185|title=14 lutego Rosjanie wkroczyli do Grünberga.

The Red Army headed by the [[3rd Army (Soviet Union)|Third Army]] began artillery fire at 13:00 from cannons positioned on the hills south of Racula. After reaching the northern border of this village, the reconnaissance units moved towards the city. Some of them, following an arc, ended up in [[Racula]], others in [[Stary Kisielin]] and even in [[Jany, Lubusz Voivodeship|Jany]], and still others took over {{ill|Jędrzychów (Zielona Góra)|pl|Jędrzychów (Zielona Góra)}}. The main unit entered the city along Wrocławska Street. Soon, small groups of Red Army soldiers began to appear from the side of Kożuchowska Street. The 3rd Army established their headquarters in the Poviat Office building.<ref name=chajewski/>

In that period, about 500 people committed suicide.<ref name=lakotta>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/spiegelspecial/d-39863564.html|title=Tief vergraben, nicht dran rühren|last=Lakotta|first=Beate|publisher=[[Der Spiegel|SPON]]|date=2005-03-05|access-date=2010-08-16|language=de}}</ref> The following month, according to the post-war [[Potsdam Agreement]], the town was placed under Polish administration under territorial compensation for the [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|territories of former Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union]].

===Recent history===
[[File:Polska welna zielona góra.jpg|thumb|Wool factory in the 1960s]]
From 1950 to 1998 Zielona Góra was the capital of the Zielona Góra Voivodeship. The city's population rebounded quickly after the war. By 1950 it had more inhabitants than at any point in its history.<ref name=GL/>

The [[University of Zielona Góra]] was opened in 2001. The city is also the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona Góra-Gorzów]].

==Geography==
Zielona Góra is surrounded by tree-covered hills. The adjacent woodland makes up approximately half of the city's total area. The name of the city translates to 'Green Mountain' in both [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[German language|German]]. Zielona Góra features several tourist attractions and important historical sites including the preserved [[medieval]] Old Town, 13th-century Market Square, [[tenements]], palaces, parks and the famous [[Palm House]] on Wine Hill. Its strong connection to vineyards and grape-picking earned Zielona Góra the nickname "The City of Wine".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.qubushotel.com/en/hotels/11/tag/atrakcje_miasta/|title=Qubus Hotel Zielona Góra – The city's attractions|website=Qubushotel.com|access-date=24 September 2017|archive-date=24 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924141700/https://www.qubushotel.com/en/hotels/11/tag/atrakcje_miasta/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Wineries===
The city has been known for its wines for centuries.<ref>{{cite EB9 |wstitle = Grünberg |volume= XI | page = 225 |short=1}}</ref> It is now one of two places in Poland with [[wine]] grape cultivation mainly for white wines, the other being the wine growing region near the town of [[Warka]] in [[Masovia]]. The first wineries around the city were built in 1314. At the [[Gościkowo|Paradyż]] Abbey near Zielona Góra, monks have been making wine since 1250. The number of vineyards at peak production is estimated at 4,000 in the region, with 2,500 in Zielona Góra itself.

During the communist era wine production was reduced, but since 1990 it has recovered. Since 1852, [[Zielona Góra Wine Fest|an annual wine festival]] has taken place in the town. Wine is no longer produced in Zielona Góra itself, with the last factory closed in the early 1990s.

Vodka ''[[Luksusowa (vodka)|Luksusowa]]'' (namely: Luxury vodka), made from potatoes rather than grain, is produced in distillery in Zielona Góra. ''Jarzębiak'', a Polish fruit vodka made from [[rowan]] berries and other fruit ingredients, registered as a regional traditional beverage by the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Poland)|Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland]], is also produced in Zielona Góra.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.pl/web/rolnictwo/jarzebiak|title=Jarzębiak|website=Ministerstwo Rolnictwa i Rozwoju Wsi - Portal Gov.pl|access-date=16 May 2024|language=pl}}</ref>

Another officially designated traditional beverage is the Zielona Góra beer, with local brewing traditions dating back to the 18th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.pl/web/rolnictwo/piwo-zielonogorskie|title=Piwo zielonogórskie|website=Ministerstwo Rolnictwa i Rozwoju Wsi - Portal Gov.pl|access-date=16 May 2024|language=pl}}</ref>

==Climate==
The climate is [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb'') with some [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] characteristics (''Dfb'') in normals previous to 1981–2010. Despite being some distance from the sea, western standards as well as [[air mass]]es are still predominant in the western than eastern, not very different from [[List of cities and towns in Germany|German cities]] near the border.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=421&cityname=Zielona+Gora,+Lubusz,+Poland&units=metric|title=Zielona Gora, Poland Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2018-12-31}}</ref>
