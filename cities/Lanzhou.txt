==History==
[[File:Lanchou_City_and_Hwang_Ho.jpg|left|thumb|Lanzhou and the [[Zhongshan Bridge]] under construction in 1909 taken by [[Robert Sterling Clark]]]]
[[File:West Gate of City Wall of Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China, 1875 WDL2082.png|thumb|200px|left|The West Gate ({{zh|labels=no|s=西关 |p=Xīguān}}) of the old city wall in 1875. It has been demolished, although its busy neighborhood still bears its name.]]

Originally in the territory of the [[Qiang (historical people)|ancient Western Qiang]]s, Lanzhou became part of the territory of the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]] in the 6th century BC.

In 81 BC, under the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC–AD 220), it was taken from the Huns' Huandi Chanyu and made the seat of '''Jincheng''' [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] ({{zhi|p=jùn}}), and later of the Jincheng (Golden City) [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|county]] ({{zhi|p=xiàn}}), later renamed ''Yunwu''. From at least the first millennium BC it was a major link on the ancient [[Northern Silk Road]],<ref>{{Cite journal|title=On the relation between the evolution of natural environment and human factors and the development of urban settlement—Take the Lanzhou Valley Basin as an examples|first1=Xiaowei|last1=Xian|first2=Linyuan|last2=Zhang|first3=Nanshan|last3=Ai|first4=Wohlke|last4=Wihelm|date=March 1, 1991|journal=Chinese Geographical Science|volume=1|issue=1|pages=42–53|doi=10.1007/BF02664455|bibcode=1991ChGpS...1...42X |s2cid=195214733}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18006|title=Silk Road, North China|website=The Megalithic Portal}}</ref>  and also an important historic [[Yellow River]] crossing site. To protect the city, the [[Great Wall of China]] was extended as far as [[Yumen Pass|Yumen]]. Parts of the Great Wall still exist within the built-up area.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211212/F48_HZQFtKM Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20170405152536/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F48_HZQFtKM Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite AV media |trans-title=Yellow River Capital Jincheng Lanzhou |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F48_HZQFtKM |script-title=zh:城内外（116）黄河之都金城兰州 }}{{cbignore}}</ref>

After the fall of the [[Han dynasty]], Lanzhou became the capital of a succession of tribal states. In the 4th century it was briefly the capital of the independent state of [[Earlier Liang|Liang]]. The [[Northern Wei dynasty]] (386–534) reestablished [[Jincheng]] commandery, renaming the county [[Jincheng]]. Mixed with different cultural heritages, the area at present-day [[Gansu]] province, from the 5th to the 11th century, became a center for [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] study. Under the [[Sui dynasty]] (581–618) the city became the seat of Lanzhou prefecture for the first time, retaining this name under the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907). In 763 the area was overrun by the [[Tibetan Empire]] and in 843 was conquered by the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]]. Later it fell into the hands of the [[Western Xia dynasty]] (which flourished in [[Qinghai]] from the 11th to 13th century) and was subsequently absorbed by the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1126) in 1081. The name Lanzhou was reestablished, and the county renamed Lanzhuan.

After 1127 it fell into the hands of the [[Jin dynasty, 1115–1234|Jin dynasty]], and after 1235 it came into the possession of the [[Mongol Empire]].

Under the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644) the prefecture was demoted to a county and placed under the administration of [[Lintao]] superior prefecture, but in 1477 Lanzhou was reestablished as a political unit.

The city acquired its current name in 1656, during the [[Qing dynasty]]. When [[Gansu]] was made a separate province in 1666, Lanzhou became its capital.

In 1739 the seat of [[Lintao]] was transferred to Lanzhou, which was later made a superior prefecture called Lanzhou.

Lanzhou was badly damaged during the [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)|Dungan revolt]] in 1864–1875. In the 1920s and 1930s it became a center of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence in [[northwestern China]].

===Second Sino-Japanese War-World War II===
During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–1945) Lanzhou, linked with [[Xi'an]] by [[highway]] in 1935, became the terminus of the {{convert|3,200|km|mi|abbr=on}} Chinese–Soviet highway, used as a route for Soviet supplies destined for the Xi'an area. This highway remained the primary traffic route of northwestern China until the completion of the railway from Lanzhou to [[Ürümqi]], [[Xinjiang]].

===The Battle of Lanzhou===
Lanzhou's old ''[[Gongxingdun Airport|Donggang]]'' Airport, located near the city centre, was the primary entry point for combat aircraft provided to China under the [[Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact]], and along with other targets around Lanzhou, including civilian centers, were heavily bombed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service|Imperial Japanese Army Air Force]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service|Navy Air Force]].<ref name=hoplite>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoplite.cn/templates/jqzyhxzs0006.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323225033/http://www.hoplite.cn/templates/jqzyhxzs0006.html|archive-date= 23 March 2016|script-title=zh:兰州空战：中国空战史上最惨烈的一次消耗战！|language=zh-cn}}</ref> Many air battles were fought between the Chinese Air Force and the Imperial Japanese air forces over Lanzhou and surrounding regions from 1937 to 1945, particularly from 1938 to 1941 when the influx of Soviet war materials formed the primary support in China's War of Resistance against the Imperial Japanese invasion. Instances of major air-battles include an IJAAF raid consisting of 30 [[Fiat BR.20|BR.20]] and [[Mitsubishi Ki-21|Ki-21]] bombers against civilian targets in Lanzhou on 20 February 1939; [[Development of Chinese Nationalist air force (1937–1945)#Units of the Chinese Airforce 1937–1945|17th PS, 5th PG]] commander Capt. [[Cen Zeliu]] and his deputy commander Capt. Ma Guolian (Ma Kwok-Lim), a Canadian-Chinese volunteer for the Chinese Air Force,<ref>Cheung, 2015, p. 63. Cen (Zeliu) and Ma Kwok-Lim, from Canada, were able to make it back to base with badly damaged planes</ref> shot down the first two bombers in the battle, followed by two more downed as Capt. Cen led another attack on the third formation. They would be joined by pilots of the [[Soviet Volunteer Group]] led by Nikolay Garilov and the 15th PS led by Li Debiao, who would all shoot down five more of the Japanese bombers; the northern Chinese air-raid early-warning net headquarters in [[Xi'an]] observed 21 of the original 30 IJAAF bombers returning from Lanzhou.

As the Imperial Japanese forces were preparing for ''[[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Operation Z]]'' against the United States and other allies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific by mid-1941, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service|IJANF]] were busy training new aircrews in live combat action across China for the upcoming war in the Pacific; on 22 May 1941, Lt. [[Gao Youxin]] of the 21st PS, 4th PG engaged an IJNAF raid on Lanzhou in an [[Polikarpov I-16|I-16]] fighter aircraft, while avoiding confrontation against the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|''Zero'' fighters]], he shot down a [[Mitsubishi G3M]] bomber north of Lanzhou. On the ground, the [[KMT]] [[Muslim]] Generals [[Ma Hongkui]] and [[Ma Bufang]] protected Lanzhou with their cavalry troops, putting up such resistance that the Japanese never captured Lanzhou.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6O67mW5ODV0C&q=lanzhou+resistance+never+captured+muslim+generals+ma+pu-fang+ma+hung-kwei|title=Collier's encyclopedia: with bibliography and index, Volume 14|author=Stéphane William Darrach Halsey, Bernard Johnston (M.A.)|year=1989|publisher=Macmillan Educational Co.|page=285|access-date=2010-06-28}}</ref>

==Geography==
At {{convert|1600|m}} above sea level, Lanzhou lies in [[Northwestern China|China's northwest]] geographical center. The metropolitan area covers more than {{Convert|20|km2}} of urbanisation along the southern banks of the [[Yellow River]], which flows through from west to east. The [[Qilian Ranges]], [[Mt. Pingliang]], and [[Mt. Kongtong]] are located on the south and north sides of the city.

Lanzhou is situated on the upper reaches of the [[Yellow River]] where it emerges from the mountains and has been a center since early times, being at the southern end of the route leading via the [[Hexi Corridor]] across [[Central Asia]]. It commands the approaches to the ancient capital area of [[Chang'an]] (modern [[Xi'an]]) in [[Shaanxi]] province from both the west and the northwest, as well as the area of [[Qinghai Lake]] via the upper waters of the Yellow River and its tributaries.

===Climate ===

Lanzhou is situated in the [[temperate zone]] and has a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSk'') with hot summers and cold and very dry winters. In the urban core, based on 1971&ndash;2000 normals,<ref name=WCN/> the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from {{convert|−4.1|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|23.4|°C|1}} in July. The mean annual temperature is {{convert|10.9|°C|1}}, while annual [[rainfall]] is {{convert|309|mm|in}},<ref name=WCN/> almost all of which falls from May to October. The winters are so dry that snowfall is sometimes restricted to fall and spring. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 47&nbsp;percent in September to 57&nbsp;percent in April, sunshine is generous but not abundant, as the city receives 2,350 hours of bright sunshine annually.<ref name="cma new"> {{cite web

===Environmental problems===

{{Further|Environment of China}}

The city is located in a narrow and curved river valley with surrounding mountains causing it to be hemmed in blocking a free flow of air. According to the National Environmental Analysis released by [[Tsinghua University]] and The Asian Development Bank in January 2013, Lanzhou was among the ten most air-polluted cities in the world.<ref>{{cite news|title=Weather & Extreme Events 7 of 10 Most Air-Polluted Cities Are in China|url=http://news.discovery.com/earth/weather-extreme-events/7-of-10-most-air-polluted-cities-china-130116.htm|access-date=September 1, 2014|date=January 16, 2013|website=discovery.com|publisher=Imaginechina/Corbis}}</ref> Air quality reportedly was so poor that at times one could not see [[Lanshan (Gansu)|Lanshan]], the mountain rising up along the south side of the city.<ref name="Xinhua 2014"/> Lanzhou is also the home of many factories, including some involved in petroleum processing, and suffers from large [[dust storm]]s kicked up from the [[Gobi Desert]], especially in the winter and spring. In 2011, using Chinese statistics, the [[World Health Organization]] reported that Lanzhou had the worst air quality among eleven western Chinese cities. Its annual mean [[PM10]] μg/m<sup>3</sup> of 150 is 7 times the safe level established by the [[World Health Organization]]. It was worse than Beijing with its reading of 121.<ref>WHO report OAP_database_8_2011.xls</ref>

Since then, authorities have taken measures to improve air quality, which have largely been successful. "Thirteen polluting enterprises with excessive capacity have been closed, more than 200 highly polluting enterprises were suspended in winter, and 78 industrial enterprises have moved to an industrial park outside the city."<ref name="Xinhua 2014">{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2014-08/14/c_133556571.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008021022/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2014-08/14/c_133556571.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 8, 2014|title=Across China: NW China city's air pollution transformation

The large particle PM10 remains high, at 132 micrograms per cubic meter, in part as a result of sand storms.

The reach of the Yellow River at Lanzhou carries a high load of silt, giving the river its characteristic muddy appearance; however water quality in this reach is better than the "fetid outflow that barely passes for water two hours downstream" (2008).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16951806|title=Yellow River Pollution Is Price of Economic Growth|author= Rob Gifford|publisher= NPR|date= January 6, 2008}}</ref> In recent years, several specimens of the endangered [[Chinese giant salamander]] have been found in and near the Yellow River in Lanzhou.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.163.com/15/0816/09/B14M1AD100014AED.html |script-title=zh:兰州三名男子黄河边捡到娃娃鱼 已交到派出所_网易新闻 |website=news.163.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.163.com/16/0731/06/BT9JH8IH00014AEE.html |script-title=zh:皋兰什川农民在小峡电站库区发现罕见"娃娃鱼"_网易新闻 |website=news.163.com}}</ref>

===Earthquakes===
Lanzhou experiences earthquakes regularly, although usually at low intensities.  In 1920 a large earthquake was experienced killing more than 100,000 people in Ningxia and Eastern Gansu province, although only 42 were killed in Lanzhou itself, the low number being attributed to the strong yet flexible nature of the wooden buildings in the city.<ref>"The Earthquake," E. J. Mann in Links with China and Other Lands, No. 31, April 1921, Lanzhou: China Inland Mission (quarterly) Bound volume in MS 380302, Papers of Ebenezer and Mabel Mann, SOAS, 331.[http://www.mundus.ac.uk/cats/4/913.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011230757/http://www.mundus.ac.uk/cats/4/913.htm|date=October 11, 2013}}</ref> Lanzhou was also affected by [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]] in 2008.

== Demographics ==
As of the [[2020 Chinese census]], Lanzhou surpassed 4 million population for the first time, with a total population of 4,359,446 inhabitants and 3,042,863 in the built-up (''or metro'') area of 1,112.9 square kilometres (429.7 sq mi) made of the 4 central urban districts (Chengguan, Qilihe, Anning and Xigu District). [[Lanzhou New Area]], near the airport and Honggu Districts are not yet conurbated. The growth increased significantly after a period of slower growth. The strong growth has been attributed to parents seeking better education opportunities for their children, retired [[Migrant workers in China|migrant workers]] returning to Gansu, improved services in the city and government policies.<ref>{{Cite web|last=财经自媒体|date=2021-05-26|title=人口增加74万 兰州离"强省会"还有多远？|url=https://finance.sina.com.cn/china/gncj/2021-05-26/doc-ikmxzfmm4706298.shtml|access-date=2021-06-09|website=finance.sina.com.cn}}</ref>
