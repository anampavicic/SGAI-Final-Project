==Name==
The present name of the city is believed to have come from its former Greek name of {{transliteration|el|Amisós}} ({{lang|el|Αμισός}}) by a [[Rebracketing#In Greek|reinterpretation]] of {{transliteration|el|eís Amisón}} (meaning "to Amisós") and {{transliteration|el|ounta}} (Greek suffix for place names) to {{transliteration|el|[eí]s Am[p]s-únta}} ({{lang|el|Σαμψούντα}}: {{transliteration|el|Sampsúnta}}) and then Samsun<ref>[[Özhan Öztürk]].

The early Greek historian [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]] wrote that Amisos was formerly called ''[[Paphlagonian Eneti|Enete]]'', the place mentioned in Homer's ''[[Iliad]]''. In Book II, Homer says that the ''ἐνετοί'' (Enetoi) inhabited [[Paphlagonia]] on the southern coast of the [[Black Sea]] in the time of the [[Trojan War]] (c. 1200&nbsp;BC). The Paphlagonians are listed among the allies of the [[Troy|Trojans]] in the war, where their king [[Pylaemenes]] and his son [[Harpalion]] perished.<ref name="iliad">Homer, ''Iliad''; [http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/iliad.2.ii.html online version] at classics.mit.edu, accessed on 2009-08-18. Book II: "The Paphlagonians were commanded by stout-hearted Pylaemanes from Enetae, where the mules run wild in herds. These were they that held [[Cytorus]] and the country round [[Sesamus]], with the cities by the river [[Bartın River|Parthenius]], [[Cromna (place)|Cromna]], [[Aegialus]], and lofty [[Erithini]]."</ref> [[Strabo]] mentioned that the inhabitants had disappeared by his time.<ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0198:book=12:chapter=3&highlight=thracian%2Ceneti Strab. 12.3] "Tieium is a town that has nothing worthy of mention except that Philetaerus, the founder of the family of Attalic Kings, was from there. Then comes the Parthenius River, which flows through flowery districts and on this account came by its name; it has its sources in Paphlagonia itself. And then comes Paphlagonia and the Eneti. Writers question whom the poet means by 'the Eneti,' when he says, 'And the rugged heart of Pylaemenes led the Paphlagonians, from the land of the Eneti, whence the breed of wild mules; for at the present time, they say, there are no Eneti to be seen in Paphlagonia, though some say that there is a village on the Aegialus ten schoeni distant from Amastris.' But Zenodotus writes 'from Enete,' and says that Homer clearly indicates the Amisus of today. And others say that a tribe called Eneti, bordering on the Cappadocians, made an expedition with the Cimmerians and then were driven out to the Adriatic Sea. But the thing upon which there is general agreement is, that the Eneti, to whom Pylaemenes belonged, were the most notable tribe of the Paphlagonians, and that, furthermore, these made the expedition with him in very great numbers, but, losing their leader, crossed over to Thrace after the capture of Troy, and on their wanderings went to the Enetian country, as it is now called. According to some writers, Antenor and his children took part in this expedition and settled at the recess of the Adriatic, as mentioned by me in my account of Italy. It is therefore reasonable to suppose that it was on this account that the Eneti disappeared and are not to be seen in Paphlagonia."</ref>

Samsun has also been known as ''Peiraieos'' by Athenian settlers and even briefly as ''Pompeiopolis'' by [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]].<ref name="Samsun Guide">{{cite web|title=Samsun Guide|url=http://www.yesilirmak.org.tr/malzemeler/Rehber_Samsun_EN.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222153628/http://www.yesilirmak.org.tr/malzemeler/Rehber_Samsun_EN.pdf|archive-date=22 February 2014}}</ref>

The city was called ''Simisso'' by the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]. It was during the [[Ottoman Empire]], that its present name was written as {{langx|ota|صامسون}} (''Ṣāmsūn''). The city has been known as Samsun since the formation of the Turkish Republic in 1923.

Paleolithic artifacts found in the [[Tekkeköy]] Caves can be seen in Samsun Archaeology Museum.

The earliest layer excavated of the [[Tell (archaeology)|höyük]] of Dündartepe revealed a [[Chalcolithic]] settlement. Early [[Bronze Age]] and [[Hittites|Hittite]] settlements were also found there<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN,35044/culture.html|title=..:: REPUBLIC OF TURKEY MINISTRY OF CULTURE AND TOURISM ::..|access-date=25 May 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525224107/http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN,35044/culture.html|archive-date=25 May 2015}}</ref> and at Tekkeköy.

Samsun (then known as '''Amisos''', Greek Αμισός, alternative spelling ''Amisus'') was settled in about 760–750 BC by Ionians from [[Miletus]],<ref>{{cite web|title=..:: REPUBLIC OF TURKEY MINISTRY OF CULTURE AND TOURISM ::.. |url=http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/belge/2-22191/history.html|access-date=25 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404094409/http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/belge/2-22191/history.html |archive-date=4 April 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> who established a flourishing trade relationship with the ancient peoples of [[Anatolia]]. The city's ideal combination of fertile ground and shallow waters attracted numerous traders.<ref>Cohen, Getzel M. (1995). "The Hellenistic Settlements in Europe, the Islands, and Asia Minor". Berkeley and Los Angeles: California: University of California Press. p. 384.</ref>

Amisus was settled by the Ionian [[Milesians (Greek)|Milesians]] in the 6th century BC,<ref name="Wilson, M. W p. 3">Wilson, M. W. "Cities of God in Northern Asia Minor: Using Stark's Social Theories to Reconstruct Peter's Communities".

===Persian Period===
The city was captured by the Persians in 550 BC and became part of [[Cappadocia (satrapy)]].<ref name="Samsun Guide"/> In the 5th century BC, Amisus became a free state and one of the members of the [[Delian League]] led by the [[Athenians]];<ref name="Wilson, M. W p. 4">Wilson, M. W. "Cities of God in Northern Asia Minor: Using Stark's Social Theories to Reconstruct Peter's Communities".

Oxford: The Clarendon Press. p. 149.</ref> A historical tradition from [[Theopompus]] by way of [[Strabo]] has it that the city was originally colonized by the Greeks by a man named [[Athenocles of Athens|Athenocles]]. Starting in the 3rd century BC, the city came under the control of Mithridates I, later founder of the [[Kingdom of Pontus]]. The [[Amisos treasure]] may have belonged to one of the kings. 
Tumuli, containing tombs dated between 300 BC and 30 BC, can be seen at Amisos Hill but unfortunately Toraman Tepe was mostly flattened during construction of the 20th century radar base.<ref>{{cite web|title=ESKİ SAMSUN' DA (AMİSOS) AYDINLANAN TARİH|url=http://www.kultur.samsun.bel.tr/programlar/amisos/amisos.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030055130/http://www.kultur.samsun.bel.tr/programlar/amisos/amisos.htm|archive-date=30 October 2014}}</ref>

===Roman Period===
The Romans conquered Amisus in 71 BC during the [[Third Mithridatic War]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Antik Amisos Kenti|url=http://www.samsun.bel.tr/tarihi-ile-samsun.asp|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330143400/http://www.samsun.bel.tr/tarihi-ile-samsun.asp|archive-date=30 March 2014}}</ref> and Amisus became part of [[Bithynia et Pontus]] province. Around 46 BC, during the reign of Julius Caesar, Amisus became the capital of Roman Pontus.<ref name="Wilson, M. W p. 3"/> From the period of the Second Triumvirate up to Nero, Pontus was ruled by several client kings, as well as one client queen, [[Pythodorida of Pontus]], a granddaughter of Marcus Antonius.  From 62 CE it was directly ruled by Roman governors, most famously by Trajan's appointee Pliny. [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny the Younger's]] address to the [[Emperor Trajan]] in the 1st century CE "By your indulgence, sir, they have the benefit of their own laws," is interpreted by [[John Boyle, 5th Earl of Cork|John Boyle Orrery]] to indicate that the freedoms won for those in Pontus by the Romans was not pure freedom and depended on the generosity of the Roman emperor.<ref name="Orrery, J. B. 1752 p. 407">Orrery, J. B. (1752). "The Letters of Pliny the Younger: With Observations on Each Letter; and an Essay on Pliny's Life, Addressed to Charles Lord Boyle". The 3rd ed. London: Printed by James Bettenham, for Paul Vaillant. p. 407.</ref>

The estimated population of the city around 150 AD is between 20,000 and 25,000 people, classifying it as a relatively large city for that time.<ref>Mitchell, S. (1995). "Anatolia: Land, Men, and Gods in Asia Minor". Journal of Roman Studies, 85. pp. 301–302.</ref> The city functioned as the commercial capital for the province of Pontus; beating its rival [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] (now Sinop) due to its position at the head of the trans-Anatolia highway.<ref name="Wilson, M. W p. 4"/>

In [[Late Antiquity]], the city became part of the [[Diocese of Pontus|Dioecesis Pontica]] within the eastern [[Roman Empire]]; later still it was part of the [[Armeniac Theme]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |author=Giftopoulou Sofia |translator=Koutras Nikolaos |date=2003-03-17|title=Amisos (Byzantium) |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Hellenic World, Asia Minor |url=http://www.ehw.gr/l.aspx?id=7207 |access-date=2013-12-07 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20131207185832/http://www.ehw.gr/l.aspx?id=7207 |archive-date=7 December 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Samsun Castle]] was built on the seaside in 1192, it was demolished between 1909 and 1918.

Though the roots of the city are [[Hellenistic]],<ref name="Wilson, M. W p. 3" /> it was also one of the centers of an early Christian congregation.<ref name="Wilson, M. W p. 3" /> Its function as a commercial metropolis in northern [[Asia Minor]] was a contributing factor to enable the spread of Christian influence. As a large port city – the commercial capital of Pontus <ref>Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies. (2013). "Roads to Pontus, Royal and Roman." ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' (Vol. 21).

"Cities of God in Northern Asia Minor: Using Stark's Social Theories to Reconstruct Peter's Communities". ''Verbum et Ecclesia'' 32 (1). p. 2.</ref> According to [[Josephus]], there was large Jewish [[diaspora]] in Asia Minor.<ref name="Schalit, A 2015">Schalit, A. "Asia Minor." ''Encyclopedia Judaica''. Accessed 11 March 2015.</ref> Given that the early [[Evangelism|evangelist Christians]] focused on Jewish diaspora communities, and that the Jewish diaspora in Amisus was a geographically accessible group with a mixed heritage group, it is not surprising that Amisus would be an appealing site for evangelist work. The author of [http://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-1.htm 1 Peter 1:1] addresses the Jewish diaspora of the province of Pontus, along with four other provinces: "Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To God's elect, exiles scattered throughout the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia." (Peter 1:1) As Amisus would have been the largest commercial port-city in the province, it is believed certain that the spread of Christianity in the region would have begun there.<ref name="Schalit, A 2015" /> In the 1st century [[Pliny the Younger]] documents [http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/texts/pliny.html accounts] of Christians in and around the cities of Pontus.<ref>"Pliny and Trajan on the Christians." Pliny and Trajan on the Christians. Accessed 7 April 2015.</ref> His accounts center on his conflicts with the Christians when he served under the [[Emperor Trajan]] and describe early Christian communities, his condemnation of their refusal to renounce their religion, but also describes his tolerance for some Christian practices like Christian charitable societies.<ref>Alikin, V. A. (2010). 'Chapter 7.' In ''The Earliest History of the Christian Gathering: Origin, Development and Content of the Christian Gathering in the First to Third Centuries''. Leiden: Brill. p. 270.</ref> Many great early Christian figures had connections to Amisus, including [[Caesarea Mazaca]], [[Gregory the Illuminator]] (raised as a Christian from 257 CE when he was brought to Amisus) and [[Basil the Great]] (Bishop of the city 330–379 CE).<ref>Wilson, M. W. "Cities of God in Northern Asia Minor: Using Stark's Social Theories to Reconstruct Peter's Communities". Verbum et Ecclesia 32 (1). p. 7.</ref>

Christian bishops of Amisus include Antonius, who took part in the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451; Erythraeus, a signatory of the letter that the bishops of Helenopontus wrote to Emperor [[Leo I the Thracian]] after the killing of Patriarch [[Proterius of Alexandria]]; the late 6th-century bishop Florus, venerated as a saint in the Greek [[menologion]]; and Tiberius, who attended the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] (680), Leo, the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] (787), and Basilius, the [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)|Council of Constantinople of 879]]. The diocese is no longer mentioned in the Greek [[Notitiae Episcopatuum]] after the 15th century and thereafter the city was considered part of the see of [[Bishop of Amasea|Amasea]]. However, some Greek bishops of the 18th and 19th centuries bore the title of Amisus as [[titular bishop]]s.<ref>Siméon Vailhé, v.

After the breakup of the Seljuk Empire into [[Anatolian beyliks|small principalities (beyliks)]] in the late 13th century, the city was ruled by one of them, the [[Isfendiyarids]]. It was captured from the Isfendiyarids at the end of the 14th century by the rival Ottoman beylik (later the [[Ottoman Empire]]) under sultan [[Bayezid I]], but was lost again shortly afterwards.

The Ottomans permanently conquered the town in the weeks following 11 August 1420.<ref>Zehiroğlu, A.M. (2018) "Trabzon İmparatorluğu" vol.III pp.150–156 {{ISBN|978-6058103207}}</ref>

Atatürk, appointed by the Ottoman government as Inspector of the [[Ninth Army (Ottoman Empire)#After Mudros|Ninth Army Troops Inspectorate]] of the Empire in eastern [[Anatolia]], left Constantinople aboard the now-famous {{ship|SS|Bandırma}} on May 16 for Samsun. Instead of obeying the orders of the Ottoman government, then under the control of the occupying Allies, he and a number of colleagues declared the beginning of the Turkish national movement. The Allies claimed that the Greek population of Samsun was subject looting by Turkish irregular groups, as noted by representatives of the American [[Near East Foundation|Near East Relief]], an Allied organization.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prott|first1=Volker|title=The Politics of Self-Determination: Remaking Territories and National Identities in Europe, 1917–1923|date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191083556|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jXjADAAAQBAJ |quote=They lotted and burned the houses of the Greeks...

Later, in early June 1922, the city was [[Bombardment of Samsun|bombarded]] by the Allied navy, consisting of American and Greek warships. The Allied bombardment against the Turks was a strategic failure. Following Turkey's victory, the Greek population left for Greece after the 1923 [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|Population Exchange]] founding villages including Nea Sampsounda in [[Preveza (regional unit)|Preveza]], [[Greece]].

After the establishment of the Republic, Samsun was declared a province with five districts [[Bafra]], [[Çarşamba]], [[Havza]], [[Terme]] and [[Vezirköprü]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Provincial and District Establishment Dates |url=http://www.illeridaresi.gov.tr/kurumlar/illeridaresi.gov.tr/İstatistiki%20Bilgiler/İl%20İdaresi%20ve%20Mülki%20Bölümler/TARİH(1).pdf |website=General Directorate of Provincial Administration|access-date=14 June 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20191219003805/http://www.illeridaresi.gov.tr/kurumlar/illeridaresi.gov.tr/%C4%B0statistiki%20Bilgiler/%C4%B0l%20%C4%B0daresi%20ve%20M%C3%BClki%20B%C3%B6l%C3%BCmler/TAR%C4%B0H%281%29.pdf |archive-date=19 December 2019|page=72|url-status=dead}}</ref> Samsun added additional districts in later years.

Neighboring Atakum, a suburb to the west of the city center was established in 2008 with the merger of Atakent, Kurupelit, Altınkum, Çatalçam and Taflan towns into one municipality. [[Atakum]] in recent years has become a bedroom community to Samsun and home to much of the region's professional class.

Multiple other large developments have further established Samsun as a major urban center. In 2013, Piazza Samsun a 160 store shopping mall, the largest in the Central Black Sea region, opened in the city center. The opening of the mall was followed by the construction of 115 m tall [[Sheraton Hotel Samsun]]. Now the second tallest building in the region, the hotel at the time was the first building in Samsun's history to stand more than 100 m. In 2017, [[Samsunspor]] opened a new 30,000 person stadium in [[Tekkeköy]]. [[Gökdelen Towers]] is now the tallest building in the Samsun region and representative of a recent trend towards high-rise residential housing.

Under the leadership of Metropolitan Mayor [[Mustafa Demir]], the Samsun regional government has undertaken several major transportation and housing development projects in the city center. Projects include the restoration of the Mert River, the construction of the new National Garden, the restoration of Tarihi Şifa Hamamı and the construction of [[Samsun Saathane Square]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.yenigundehaber.com/samsunda-tarihi-proje/ | title=SAMSUN'DA TARİHİ PROJE &#124; Yeni Günde Haber &#124; Güncel Son Dakika Haberler | date=15 December 2020 }}</ref>

==Geography==
Samsun is a long city which extends along the coast between two river deltas which jut into the [[Black Sea]]. It is located at the end of an ancient route from [[Cappadocia]]: the ''Amisos'' of antiquity lay on the headland northwest of the modern city center.

The city is growing fast: land has been reclaimed from the sea and many more apartment blocks and shopping malls are currently being built. Industry is tending to move (or be moved) east, further away from the city center and towards the airport.

===Rivers===
To Samsun's west, lies the [[Kızıl River|Kızılırmak]] ("Red River", the ''Halys'' of antiquity), one of the longest rivers in [[Anatolia]] and its fertile delta. To the east, lie the [[Yeşil River|Yeşilırmak]] ("Green River", the ''Iris'' of antiquity) and its delta. The [[River Mert]] reaches the sea at the city.

===Climate===
Samsun has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa,'' [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]'': Cf''), typical for the region, but Samsun is nevertheless drier during summer and milder during winter than most of the southern Black Sea coast.

Summers are warm, the average maximum temperature is around {{convert|27|°C|0|abbr=on}} in August. Winters are cool to mild and wet, the lowest average minimum temperature is around {{convert|4|°C|0|abbr=on}} in January.

Precipitation is heaviest in late autumn and early winter. Snow sometimes occurs between the months of December and March, but temperatures below the freezing point rarely last more than a couple of days.

The water temperature is generally mild, fluctuating between {{convert|8|-|20|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} throughout the year.

Samsun like many [[Ottoman Empire]] cities was composed of stone mosques, baths, markets and government buildings while the residential vernacular was almost exclusively wood. The city was populated with wooden konak style homes with more elaborate [[yali (residence)]] style homes for the wealthy. Beginning in the 1950s as the city's population grew many of these older wooden structures burned down or torn down and replaced with concrete frame apartment buildings which are now the predominant form of construction in the city center. The city's explosive population growth outpaced its ability to formally build housing for its new residents leading to the construction of vast areas of [[gecekondu]] on the city's suburban periphery. As the region has modernized, the Turkish government has made a full force effort to replace [[gecekondu]] with formally designed and built housing. [[TOKİ]], the state agency tasked with housing development has invested heavily in Samsun, building several large social housing developments for the city's growing population. 

===Mosques===
* Pazar Mosque, Samsun's oldest surviving building, a mosque built by the [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanate Mongols]] in the 13th century.
* [[Central Great Mosque (Samsun)]] was built by Batumlu Hacı Efendi in 1884. Its name "Valide" comes from the [[Valide sultan|mother]] of [[Ottoman Sultan]] [[Abdülaziz|Abdulaziz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.karalahana.com/karadeniz/samsun.htm|title=Samsun|access-date=25 May 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520205808/http://www.karalahana.com/karadeniz/samsun.htm|archive-date=20 May 2015}}</ref>

===Ports and shipbuilding===
[[File:Samsun_tarihî_Osmanlı_Bankası_binası.jpg|thumb|Former [[Ottoman Bank]] branch in Samsun]]
Samsun is a port city. In the early 20th century, the [[Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey]] funded the building of a harbor. Before the building of the harbor, ships had to anchor to deliver goods, approximately 1 mile or more from shore. Trade and transportation was focused around a road to and from [[Sivas]].<ref name=Prothero54>{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=W.G.|title=Armenia and Kurdistan|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|page=54|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11768/view/1/54/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055759/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11768/view/1/54/|archive-date=21 September 2013}}</ref> The privately operated port fronting the city centre handles freight, including [[RORO]] ferries to [[Novorossiysk]], whereas fishing boats land their catches in a separate harbour slightly further east. A ship building yard is under construction at the eastern city limit. Road and rail freight connections with central Anatolia can be used to send inland both the agricultural produce of the surrounding well rained upon and fertile land, and also imports from overseas.

[[Donbas]] [[anthracite]], imported via the Russian ports of [[Azov]] and [[Taganrog]], is said to be illegally exported [[Coal in Ukraine|Ukrainian coal]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Russia's Hybrid Strategy in the Sea of Azov: Divide and Antagonize (Part Two) |url=https://jamestown.org/program/russias-hybrid-strategy-in-the-sea-of-azov-divide-and-antagonize-part-two/ |newspaper=Jamestown |publisher=Jamestown Foundation |access-date=13 February 2019}}</ref> In 2019 some crew were rescued but 6 died after a ship sank in the Black Sea.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cargo ship sinks off Turkey's Black Sea coast; 6 dead |url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/turkey-crew-rescued-ship-sinks-off-black-sea-60205066 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=7 January 2019}}</ref>

===Manufacturing and food processing===
There is a light industrial zone between the city and the airport. The main manufactured products are medical devices and products, furniture (wood is imported across the Black Sea), tobacco products (although tobacco farming is now limited by the government), chemicals and automobile spare parts.

Flour mills import wheat from Ukraine and export some of the flour.

===Local government and services===
Provincial government and services (e.g. courts, prisons and hospitals) support the surrounding region. Agricultural research establishments support provincial agriculture and food processing.
