Makhachkala is the fourth-largest city in the [[Caucasus]], the largest city in the [[North Caucasus]] and the [[North Caucasian Federal District]], as well as the [[Caspian Sea#Cities|third-largest city]] on the Caspian Sea. The city is extremely ethnically diverse, with a minor ethnic Russian population.

The city's historic predecessor is the port town of Anji (Andzhi), which was located in [[Kumykia]], and which was a part of possessions of [[Shamkhalate of Tarki|Tarki state]], the capital of [[Kumyks]] known from the 8th century.<ref name=":0">Книга "Дагестан: Путеводитель с картой" Калинин Алексей, Аякс-пресс, 2021</ref><ref>''Советская историческая энциклопедия. — М.: Советская энциклопедия . Под ред. Е. М. Жукова. 1973—1982.''</ref>

The city was named ''Petrovskoye'' after [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]. After gaining city status in 1857, the Petrovskoye fortress was renamed ''Petrovsk-Port''. After the [[Russian Revolution]], Petrovsk-Port was renamed Makhachkala on May 14, 1921, after [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] revolutionary {{Interlanguage link|Makhach Dakhadaev|ru|Дахадаев, Магомед-Али}}. On the same day, it became capital of the newly formed [[Dagestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Dagestan ASSR]]. After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the city became the capital of the Republic of Dagestan.

Makhachkala is an important economic, educational, scientific, and cultural centre of the North Caucasus. The city is a major Russian seaport on the Caspian Sea, and a transport hub. It is one of the fastest-growing cities in Russia, and is currently{{when?|date=October 2023}} going through a construction boom.

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of Makhachkala}}

Makhachkala's historic predecessors were the towns of [[Tarki]] and Anji (or Andzhi, or Anji-kala), dating their history, according to some sources, back to [[Khazars|Khazar times]].<ref>С.Т.Еремян. Моисей Каланкатуйский о посольстве албанского князя Вараз Трдата к хазарскому хакану Алп-Илитверу. "Записки Института Востоковедения АН СССР", т. VII, М.-Л, 1939.</ref><ref>Лавров Л.И. Ученые записки Института истории, языка и литературы ДФ АН СССР", т. 4. 1958</ref> Some chronicles suggest that it was the name of a citadel of Khazarian capital of [[Semender]], which was called Anji-kala.<ref>Исторические сочинения Дагестана: на тюркских языках: G. M.-R. Orazaev · 2003</ref> 

During the [[Early Muslim conquests|first Muslim conquests]] of Dagestan, it was exposed to an influx of [[Muslims]]. During the reign of [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] Caliph Hisham b. Abdülmelik (724-743), the caliph's brother Maslama succeeded in establishing Islamic dominance in the region with his conquests. In the following years, one of the Umayyad commanders, Marwan b. Mohammed also organized successful raids to Dagestan. However, the Islamic domination in the region ended in 796 (180 AH) when the Khazars captured [[Derbent|Derbend]]. In the early days of the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]], the struggle against the Khazars continued. This struggle, which lasted for two centuries, ended with the victory of the Muslim Arabs. In 815, Sheikh Abu Ishaq and Sheikh Mohammed al-Kindi entered Dagestan with a volunteer army of about 2000 people and tried to spread Islam. In the second half of the 11th century, the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk Turks]] took a part of the region under their control. Dagestan was invaded by the [[Mongols]] in 1222. The [[Cumans]] (Kipchaks), who ruled in the north of the Black Sea and the Caucasus, played an important role in the [[Turkification]] of the region. Later on, the [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanids]], [[Golden Horde|Golden Horde Khanate]], [[Timurid Empire|Timurids]], [[Shirvanshah|Shirvanshahs]] and [[Safavid Iran|Safavids]] dominated Dagestan respectively. Dagestan came under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule between 1578 and 1606.<ref name=TDV>{{Cite web |title=DAĞISTAN - TDV İslâm Ansiklopedisi |url=https://islamansiklopedisi.org.tr/dagistan |access-date=August 8, 2022 |website=TDV İslam Ansiklopedisi |language=tr}}</ref>

The Safavids started operations to spread [[Shia Islam|Shiism]] in Dagestan at the beginning of the 19th century but were met with fierce resistance of Dagestanis. [[Abbas II of Persia|Shah Abbas II]] established a significant influence in Dagestan in 1639. It started to attract the attention of the Russians from the 17th century onwards. It remained the scene of a struggle for influence between Iranians, Russians and Ottomans from the beginning of the 17th century.<ref name=TDV/>

When the Safavids began to lose their power at the beginning of the 17th century, the people of Dagestan united under the leadership of Çolak Surhay Khan of the [[Gazikumukh Khanate]], and they won a victory against Iran in 1712. In order to continue their success, he took the people of Dagestan, who asked for help from the Ottoman administration, under his protection by sending gifts to the sultans of the [[Sublime Porte]].<ref name=TDV/>

{{stack|[[File:Peter der-Grosse 1838.jpg|thumb|200px|Russian Tsar [[Peter the Great]] visited what is now Makhachkala in 1722, and the settlement bore his name from 1844 to 1921]]}}

Although the Russians could not hold on to the interior of Dagestan, they expanded their sovereignty towards the Caspian coast and could only be stopped in front of Baku with the help of the Ottoman forces under the command of Mustafa Pasha. With a treaty signed between Russia and Iran in 1724, Derbend, Baku and some other places in the region were left to Russia. As a result of his struggles against the Russians, [[Nader Shah|Nadir Shah]] captured the south of Dagestan, Derbend and Baku with the Rasht Treaty signed in 1732, and some lands between the Sulak and Kura (Kür) rivers with the 1735 treaty. After 1747, the Russians regained influence in Dagestan.<ref name=TDV/>

In the 1840s, after [[Russian Empire]] seized the Kumyk plateau, Anji-kala became the place where fort Petrovskoye was founded.<ref>Конституция Республики Дагестан: научно-практический и историко-правовой комментарий, Arslan Magomedsoltanovich Khalilov, Yakub Bakhmudovich Gamzatov, Дагестанский гос. ун-т, 2002 - 460, page 445</ref> A town status was granted to the fortress in 1857.<ref name="about">{{cite web |title=General Information |url=http://www.mkala.ru/city/aboutcity/ |publisher=Republic of Dagestan |language=ru |access-date=September 3, 2017 |archive-date=November 24, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124131858/https://www.mkala.ru/city/aboutcity/ |url-status=dead}}</ref> The Russian name of the city was '''Petrovskoye''' ({{lang|ru|Петро́вское}})—after the Russian [[Tsar]] [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], who waged war in the region in 1722<ref>Голиков И.

However, among the local [[Kumyks]] the city was still known as '''Anzhi-Qala''', ''The Pearl Fortress'' (''Qala'' means fortress or a city with walls, while ''Anzhi / Inzhi / Inji'' means pearl in [[Kumyk language|Kumyk]]). There is also still a hill called '''Anji-arqa''', meaning ''the hill of Anji''.<ref name=":0" />

After gaining town status in 1857, the Petrovskoye fortress was renamed '''Petrovsk-Port''' ({{lang|ru|Петро́вск-Порт}}), sometimes simply '''Petrovsk'''.<ref name="russia.rin.ru">{{cite web |url=http://russia.rin.ru/guides_e/4939.html |title=Makhachkala}}</ref>

In 1894, a railway line linked the city to [[Vladikavkaz]] (in present-day [[North Ossetia-Alania]]) and [[Baku]] (in present-day [[Azerbaijan]]). However, despite the development, a report from 1904 detailed the spread of [[malaria]] and unsuitable drinking water in the city.<ref name="a-u-l.narod.ru">{{Cite web |url=http://a-u-l.narod.ru/Markovin-V-I_Dorogami_i_tropami_Dagestana.html |title=Марковин В.

In January 1919, during the [[Russian Civil War]], the British [[No. 221 Squadron RAF|No. 221 Squadron]] [[Royal Air Force]] based themselves at Petrovsk.  In March they were joined by [[No. 266 Squadron RAF|No. 266 Squadron]] and both squadrons were involved in bombing operations against Bolshevik forces in [[Astrakhan]] and elsewhere. In August 1919 both squadrons were withdrawn from Petrovsk.<ref>{{cite book |title=RAF Operations 1918-1938 |last=Bowyer |first=Chaz |year=1988 |publisher=William Kimber |location=London |isbn=0-7183-0671-6 |pages=40, 41}}</ref> The city was invaded by the [[Red Army]] in March 1920.<ref name="a-u-l.narod.ru"/>

As part of the Soviet revolution, place names relating to monarchy or religion were changed, and thus on May 14, 1921, Petrovsk was renamed Makhachkala, after Dagestani revolutionary [[Magomed-Ali 'Makhach' Dakhadaev]]. On the same day, it became capital of the newly formed [[Dagestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]].<ref name="a-u-l.narod.ru"/> The city incurred major damage during an earthquake on May 14, 1970.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00876415 |title=Comparison analysis of magnitude values for the daghestanian and Kirghiz earthquakes by observations of Soviet and American stations |year=1973 |last1=Gorbunova |first1=I.

A report of the International Crisis Group from 2013 describes the city as being "a city of almost one million and gained spectacular economic resources due to a construction boom, skyrocketing land prices, substantial federal funds for reconstruction, infrastructure, transport, housing, courts and administrative services.

=== Deportation of the Kumyk population and expansion of Makhachkala ===
On April 12, 1944, a decision was made to resettle the inhabitants of Kumyk villages of Tarki, Kyakhulay and Alburikent, which owned the surrounding areas, to the settlements of the deported Chechens. Most of the released land was distributed to the Makhachkala city council (6243 out of 8166 hectares), in addition to the collective farms of the mountainous regions and industrial enterprises of Makhachkala.

After the return of the Kumyk population in 1957, the lands of the collective farms were not restored, personal property was also lost, many houses were occupied by people resettled from mountainous areas. The historical monuments of the ancient city were destroyed and used as construction materials for the infrastructure of Makhachkala.<ref>Адиль-Герей Гаджиев, Доктор исторических наук, Тарки, Кяхулай, Альборикент (история, проблемы, пути решения), брошюра 1999</ref><ref>''Адиев А.

Protests and violent police clashes occurred in Makhachkala, as was the case in other Russian cities, in response to the [[2022 Russian mobilization]], as well as a call-up of 110 men from the village of [[Endirey]] to be conscripted into the ongoing [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russian invasion of Ukraine]].

==Climate==
Makhachkala has a [[cold semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''BSk'') with warm, relatively dry summers and, cool relatively moist winters. The strong [[rain shadow]] of the Caucasus and the ability of the [[Siberian High]] to freely move westwards from its source in the Tibetan and Mongolian plateaus makes the climate quite dry, although frequently overcast throughout the winter, which is owing to the relatively low latitude and nearness to the Caspian Sea very mild by Russian standards. Summers are sunnier but also dry as the region is exposed to steep descending vertical velocity from the Indian monsoon, and the greatest rainfall occurs in the autumn season from September to November. October 1987 with {{convert|245|mm|in|2|disp=or}} has been the wettest month, whilst no precipitation occurred in February 1958, October 1974 and April 1986.

The coldest month since records began in 1882 has been February 1929 with a mean monthly temperature of {{convert|−9.5|C|F|1|disp=or}}, whilst the hottest have been July 2010 and August 2014 with means of {{convert|27.1|C|F|1|disp=or}} each, although August 9, 2017, is the hottest day, reaching {{convert|40.2|C|F|disp=or}}. The coldest night was on February&nbsp;9, 2012, when the mercury fell to {{convert|−26.8|C|F|disp=or}}, beating the previous record of {{convert|−26.5|C|F|disp=or}} from December&nbsp;28, 1888.
