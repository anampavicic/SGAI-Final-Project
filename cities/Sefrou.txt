'''Sefrou''' ({{langx|ar|صفرو}}) is a city in central [[Morocco]] situated in the [[Fès-Meknès]] region. It recorded a population of 79,887 in the [[2014 Moroccan census]],<ref name=census2014/> up from 63,872 in the 2004 census.<ref name="census">{{cite web|last1=Maaroufi|first1=Youssef|title=Recensement général de la population et de l'habitat 2004|url=http://www.hcp.ma/Recensement-general-de-la-population-et-de-l-habitat-2004_a633.html|website=Site institutionnel du Haut-Commissariat au Plan du Royaume du Maroc|accessdate=21 October 2016}}</ref>

Sefrou is known for its historical Jewish population, and its annual cherry festival.

==History==
Sefrou was named for the ''Ahel Sefrou'', a [[Berbers|Berber]] tribe that once inhabited the area.<ref name="Publishing2010"/>

Sefrou's name might be brought from the berber name "''Asfru''" (ⴰⵙⴼⵔⵓ) which means "the solution" (in [[Morocco]]).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lasri Amazigh, Brahim.|title=Tadlist n ismawn Imazig̳n = Le petit livre des prénoms amazighes = The little book of Amazigh first names|date=2011|publisher=Institut royal de la culture amazighe, centre de l'amenagement linquistique (CAL)|others=Aguenaou, Karim., Institut royal de la culture amazighe.|isbn=978-9954-28-080-5|location=Rabat|oclc=793012455}}</ref>

Sefrou was once home to one of the largest settlements of [[Moroccan Jews]], the population estimated to have been as high as 8,000.<ref name="Clammer2010"/> The first Jewish people lived in the area of the Ahel Sefrou, most of whom were converted to [[Judaism]] around 2,000 years ago. In the 8th century, most of these were converted to [[Islam]] under [[Idris I of Morocco]]. In the 9th century, a second Jewish population settled from the [[Tafilalt]] area and Southern [[Algeria]]. Most of the descendants of these Jews stayed in Sefrou until 1967, when many moved to [[Israel]].<ref name="Publishing2010">{{cite book|author=DK Publishing|title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Morocco|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780756660567|url-access=registration|date=29 November 2010|publisher=DK Publishing|isbn=978-0-7566-8665-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780756660567/page/211 211]}}</ref>

[[Idris II of Morocco]] lived in Sefrou temporarily while overseeing the development of [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]].<ref name="Clammer2010"/>

On October 10, 1946, an [[Junkers Ju 52|Amiot AAC.1]] (F-BCAA) of Air Ocean crashed into a cliff at 3,600 feet 6.3 miles (10 km) south the city, killing all 16 onboard.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ASN Aircraft accident Amiot AAC.1 (Junkers Ju-52) F-BCAA Sefrou |url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19461010-0 |access-date=2023-02-22 |website=aviation-safety.net}}</ref>

==Geography==
Sefrou is located at the edge of the [[Middle Atlas]] mountain range, and is {{convert|30|km}} southeast of [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]]. Oued Aggai runs through the city, and about {{convert|1.5|km}} west of Sefrou are the Cascades, a small waterfall.<ref name="Clammer2010">{{cite book|author=Paul Clammer|title=Morocco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kkl5d8NRCOEC&pg=PA253|date=15 September 2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74220-360-7|page=253}}</ref> Wadi Aggai also takes part in irrigation for the area. The Kef el-Moumen caves contain ancient tombs, one of which is claimed to be the tomb of [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]]. There is also a spring near Sefrou called Lalla Rekia, which is purported to cure insanity.<ref name="Publishing2010"/>

==Culture==
Sefrou is known for its Sefrou Cherry Festival, which is [[UNESCO]]-endorsed, and is held annually every June.<ref>{{cite web|title=Terre de Traces Ecolodge|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/africa/morocco/hotels/terre-de-traces-ecolodge-hotel/|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=21 October 2016}}</ref> This festival, originally launched back in 1920, consists in a beauty contest in which Moroccan women would apply for the prestigious title of ''Miss Cherry''. The festival lasts for three days and includes [[Moroccan music|folk music]], [[Moroccan cuisine|Moroccan traditional cuisine]], [[Fantasia (performance)|fantasia performances]], and sporting events.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://moroccanzest.com/sefrou-cherry-festival/|title=Sefrou Cherry Festival|date=2018-09-14|work=Moroccan Zest|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-US}}</ref>
