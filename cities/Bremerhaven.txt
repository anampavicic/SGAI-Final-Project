'''Bremerhaven''' ({{IPA|de|ˌbʁeːmɐˈhaːfn̩|-|De-Bremerhaven.ogg}}; {{langx|nds|Bremerhoben}}) is a city on the east bank of the [[Weser]] estuary in northern Germany. It forms an exclave of the [[Bremen (state)|city-state of Bremen]]. The [[Geeste (river)|River Geeste]] flows through the city before emptying into the Weser. 

Bremerhaven was founded in 1827 as a seaport for [[Bremen]], and it remains one of the busiest ports in the country. It was historically rivalled by {{interlanguage link|Geestemünde|de}} on the opposite side of the Geeste, which belonged to [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] (and later [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]). Geestemünde united with neighbouring {{interlanguage link|Lehe (Bremerhaven)|de|lt=Lehe}} to form the city of {{interlanguage link|Wesermünde|de}} in 1924, and Bremerhaven was itself annexed to Wesermünde in 1939, but the entire conurbation was restored to Bremen in 1947.

== History ==
[[File:Denkmal Johann Smidt.jpg|thumb|upright|left|City founder [[Johann Smidt]]]]
[[File:Bürgermeister-Smidt-Gedächtniskirche, Bremerhaven (2017).jpg|left|thumb|upright|{{ill|Bürgermeister-Smidt-Gedächtniskirche|de}} of the [[Evangelical Church of Bremen]]]]

The town was founded in 1827, but neighboring settlements such as Lehe were in the vicinity as early as the 12th century, and   Geestendorf was "mentioned in documents of the ninth century".<ref name=Dierks,vonGarvens >{{Citation|last1=Dierks|first1=August, Dr.|last2=von Garvens|first2=Eugenie|title=Bremerhaven: Busy – Breezy – Booming – Town|year=1954|publisher=The Chamber of Commerce and Industry|location=Bremerhaven}} p. 8. Fourth revised edition. Translated into English from the original German edition titled ''Bremerhaven – tätige Stadt im Noordseewind''</ref> These tiny villages were built on small islands in the swampy estuary. In 1381, the city of [[Bremen]] established ''de facto'' rule over the lower [[Weser]] stream, including Lehe, later therefore called Bremerlehe. Early in 1653, [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Bremen-Verden]]'s troops captured Bremerlehe by force.

The [[Emperor Ferdinand III]] ordered his vassal [[Christina of Sweden]], then Duchess regnant of Bremen-Verden, to restitute Bremerlehe to Bremen. However, Swedish [[Bremen-Verden]] began the [[First Bremian War]] (March – July 1654). In the subsequent peace treaty ({{Interlanguage link multi|Recess of Stade (1654)|de|3=Erster Stader Vergleich|lt=First Stade Recess}}; November 1654) Bremen had to cede Bremerlehe and its surroundings to Swedish Bremen-Verden. The latter developed plans to found a fortified town on the site, and much later this location became the present-day city of Bremerhaven.  In 1672, under the reign of [[Charles XI of Sweden]], in [[personal union]] Duke of Bremen-Verden—colonists tried unsuccessfully to erect a castle (named [[Carlsburg, Weser|Carlsburg]] after Charles XI) there; this fortified structure was meant to protect, as well as control shipping heading for Bremen.

Finally, in 1827, the city of Bremen under [[Bürgermeister]] [[Johann Smidt]] bought the territories at the mouth of the Weser from the [[Kingdom of Hanover]]. Bremen sought this territory to retain its share of Germany's overseas trade, which was threatened by the silting up of the Weser around the old inland port of Bremen.  Bremerhaven (literally in {{langx|en|Bremer Haven/Harbour}}) was founded to be a haven for Bremen's merchant marine, becoming the second harbour for Bremen, despite being {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} downstream. Due to trade with, and emigration to, North America, the port and the town grew quickly. In 1848, Bremerhaven became the home port of the [[German Confederation]]'s [[Reichsflotte|Navy]] under [[Karl Rudolf Brommy]].

The [[Kingdom of Hanover]] founded a rival town next to Bremerhaven and called it Geestemünde (1845). Both towns grew and established the three economic pillars of trade, shipbuilding and fishing. Following inter-state negotiations at different times, Bremerhaven's boundary was several times extended at the expense of Hanoverian territory. In 1924, Geestemünde and the neighbouring municipality of Lehe were united to become the new city of Wesermünde, and in 1939 Bremerhaven (apart from the overseas port) was removed from the jurisdiction of Bremen and made a part of Wesermünde, then a part of the Prussian [[Province of Hanover]].

Bremerhaven was one of the important harbours of emigration in Europe.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/21533369.2001.9668313|title = Work in progress: Indirect passage from Europe Transmigration via the UK, 1836–1914| journal=Journal for Maritime Research| volume=3| pages=70–84|year = 2001|last1 = Evans|first1 = Nicholas J.|doi-access=free}}</ref>

All of Wesermünde, including those parts which did not previously belong to Bremerhaven, was [[American-occupied zone of Germany|a postwar enclave]] run by the United States, separate to but within the British zone of northern Germany. Most of the US military units and their personnel were assigned to the city's Carl Schurz Kaserne. One of the longest based US units at the Kaserne was a US military radio and TV station, an "Amerikanischer Soldatensender", [[AFN Bremerhaven]], which broadcast for 48 years. In 1993, the Kaserne was vacated by the US military and returned to the German government.

In 1947 the city became part of the federal state [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]] and was consequently renamed from Wesermünde to Bremerhaven. Today, Bremerhaven is a city in its own right, but also part of the [[city-state]] of Bremen, which is for all intents and purposes a state comprising two cities. In addition to being part of the federal state, the city of Bremen has owned the "overseas port" within Bremerhaven since 1927. This and other parts of Bremerhaven owned by the city of Bremen are known as ''stadtbremisch''. To complicate matters, a treaty between the two cities (as mentioned in Section 8 of Bremerhaven's municipal constitution) makes Bremerhaven responsible for the municipal administration of those parts owned directly by Bremen.<ref>Verfassung für die Stadt Bremerhaven ([http://www.bremerhaven.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=344 VerfBrhv] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518111829/http://www.bremerhaven.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=344 |date=May 18, 2006 }}); §&nbsp;8(1) Zum Stadtgebiet gehören alle Grundstücke, Fluß- und Hafenanlagen der ehemaligen Stadt Wesermünde.

In the wet dock parts, accessible by two large locks, more than 2 million cars are imported or exported every year with 2,3 million in 2014. Bremerhaven imports and exports more cars than any other city in Europe. Another million tons of "High-and-Heavy" goods are handled with [[Roll-on/roll-off|ro-ro]] ships. In 2011 a new [[panamax]]-sized lock has replaced the 1897 ''Kaiserschleuse'', then the largest lock worldwide.

== Transport ==
[[File:Bremerhaven Germany street map vector SVG.svg|thumb|Road map of Bremerhaven and the port of Bremen]]
=== Roads ===
Due to its unique geographic situation,{{clarify|date=February 2024}} Bremerhaven suffers from a few transportation difficulties. The city has been connected to the [[autobahn]] network since the late 1970s. The [[Bundesautobahn 27|A 27]] runs north–south, east of the city, connecting Bremerhaven to Bremen and [[Cuxhaven]]. Road connections to [[Hamburg]], however, are poor. The [[Bundesstraße 71]] and secondary roads therefore carry most of the heavy [[lorry]] traffic. A proposed solution is the construction of the [[Bundesautobahn 22|A 22]], the so-called ''Küstenautobahn'' (or "coastal motorway"), which would link Bremerhaven to Hamburg and [[Wilhelmshaven]]/[[Oldenburg (city)|Oldenburg]] (using the [[Weser tunnel]]). Roads leading to the overseas port are frequently overloaded with freight traffic, and solutions are presently{{when|date=February 2024}} being discussed, including a deep-cut road favoured by the city government and various interest groups.

=== Railway ===
[[File:1990-09-17 KOM 221 Hst Tiroler Str (41-24).jpg|thumb|Bus in Bremerhaven, Final stop Tiroler Str.]]
[[File:Fahrplanheft der Bremerhavener Straßenbahn.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|Timetable Tram 1911]]
Bremerhaven has three active passenger rail stations: [[Bremerhaven Hauptbahnhof]] in the city centre, [[Bremerhaven-Lehe railway station|Bremerhaven-Lehe]] north of the centre and [[Bremerhaven-Wulsdorf railway station|Bremerhaven-Wulsdorf]] in the southern part of the city. All three stations are served by hourly [[Bremen S-Bahn]] trains on the line '''RS 2''' as well as regional services to [[Cuxhaven]] and [[Buxtehude]] on the line '''RB 33'''. 
Additionally, Bremerhaven Hauptbahnhof is served by regional express trains to [[Hanover]] ('''RE 8''') and [[Osnabrück]] ('''RE 9''') and was reconnected to Deutsche Bahn's [[Intercity (Deutsche Bahn)|Intercity]] network in late 2021, after nearly 20 years without long-distance rail services in the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.butenunbinnen.de/nachrichten/fernverkehr-deutsche-bahn-bremerhaven-zug-100.html|title=Nach 20 Jahren fährt wieder ein IC ab Bremerhaven - buten un binnen|website=www.butenunbinnen.de|accessdate=16 March 2023}}</ref>

A fourth station, [[Bremerhaven-Speckenbüttel railway station|Bremerhaven-Speckenbüttel]] near the border with [[Langen, Lower Saxony|Langen]], has been out of service since 1988. Apart from passenger traffic, the railways in Bremerhaven carry a heavy load of freight traffic from and to the seaport, mostly new cars, [[Container (cargo)|containers]] and food.

=== Bus ===
In 2020, Bremerhaven had a bus network with 19 bus routes operated by BREMERHAVEN BUS. Two of the bus routes are night routes that only run on weekends. In addition, there is the ''Schnellbus-Line S'', which serves selected stops and is therefore faster.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Paul Homann|title=Bremerhavener Streckennetze - Tram and bus route networks since 1881 |url=https://bremerhavenbus.de/fileadmin/downloads/Bremerhavener-Streckennetze_v21.pdf |page=109|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200828073447/https://bremerhavenbus.de/fileadmin/downloads/Bremerhavener-Streckennetze_v21.pdf|archive-date=2020-08-28}}</ref> BREMERHAVEN BUS operates up to 87 regular buses through the company ''Verkehrsgesellschaft Bremerhaven AG (VGB)''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Paul Homann|title=VGB-Linienbusse - Buses for the town bus network|url=https://busse-weser.org/download/VGB-Fahrzeugliste.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210101100504/https://busse-weser.org/download/VGB-Fahrzeugliste.pdf|archive-date=2021-01-01}}</ref> There are numerous regional buses operated by other companies that depart from Bremerhaven Central Station, to [[Bad Bederkesa]], [[Beverstedt]], Hagen, [[Nordholz]] and [[Otterndorf]]. In addition, Bremerhaven is also served by buses from [[Flixbus]].

=== Tram ===
Bremerhaven had a tram service from 1881 to 1982.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Paul Homann|title=Bremerhavener Streckennetze - Tram and bus route networks since 1881 |url=https://bremerhavenbus.de/fileadmin/downloads/Bremerhavener-Streckennetze_v21.pdf|page=3 & 46 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200828073447/https://bremerhavenbus.de/fileadmin/downloads/Bremerhavener-Streckennetze_v21.pdf|archive-date=2020-08-28}}</ref>

Bremerhaven has only a few historical buildings, and the [[high street]] and city centre are almost entirely post-war. The main attractions for tourists are found at the ''Havenwelten'' and include an attraction about climate change, the {{ill|Klimahaus Bremerhaven 8° Ost|de|Klimahaus Bremerhaven}}, the [[German Emigration Center]] (since August 8, 2005) and the [[Deutsches Schiffahrtsmuseum|German Maritime Museum]] (''Deutsches Schiffahrtsmuseum'') by [[Hans Scharoun]] from 1975, featuring the [[Bremen cog|Hansekogge]], a vintage [[Cog (ship)|cog]] dating from 1380, excavated in Bremen in 1962, and the historical harbour (''Museumshafen'') with a number of [[museum ship]]s, such as the [[Type XXI U-boat]] ''[[Wilhelm Bauer (U-boat)|Wilhelm Bauer]]'' (a museum of its own), and the salvage tug ''Seefalke'' from 1924. The ''[[Bremerhaven Zoo]]'' reopened on 27 March 2004, after a lengthy renovation.  It features [[Arctic]] wildlife, both terrestrial and marine. The latest addition is the ''Klimahaus'' from 2009, simulating travel adventure along the 8th line of [[longitude]] and dealing with climate issues. Two gazebos can be found on top of the ''Atlantic Hotel Sail City'' and the [[Bremerhaven Radar Tower|Radar Tower]]. Another tourist spot is the ''Fischereihafen'' (fishing port) in Geestemünde which also houses an aquarium (the Atlanticum). The [[Lloyd Werft]] [[shipyard]] is renowned for building and renovating large cruise liners, for example [[SS France (1961)|''Norway'']].
