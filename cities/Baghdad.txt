In 762 AD, Baghdad was founded as the capital of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], and became its most notable major development project. Within a short time, it evolved into a significant cultural and intellectual center of the [[Muslim world]]. This, in addition to housing several key academic institutions, including the [[House of Wisdom]], as well as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious environment, garnered it a worldwide reputation as the "Center of Learning". For much of the Abbasid era, during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], Baghdad was the largest city in the world. Its population peaked at more than one million people. The city was largely [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|destroyed]] at the hands of the [[Mongol Empire]] in 1258, resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues and multiple successive empires, such as the Mesopotamian Mamluk Sultanate and the Ottoman Empire, until the World War I.<ref>{{cite web |date=6 April 2011 |title=Largest Cities Through History |url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050527095609/http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm |archive-date=27 May 2005 |access-date=19 June 2011 |publisher=Geography.about.com}}</ref>

The city served as capital of the former [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]]. With the recognition of [[Iraq]] as an [[Kingdom of Iraq|independent monarchical state]] in 1932, Baghdad gradually regained some of its former prominence as a significant center of [[Arab culture]]. Baghdad has faced [[Damage to Baghdad during the Iraq War|severe infrastructural damage]] due to the [[Iraq War]], which began with the United States-led [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]], the subsequent [[Iraqi insurgency (2011–2013)|insurgency]] and renewed [[War in Iraq (2013–2017)|war]], resulting in a [[Archaeological looting in Iraq|substantial loss of cultural heritage and historical artifacts]]. During this period, it had one of the highest rates of terrorist attacks in the world. However, terrorist attacks have gradually been on the decline since the territorial defeat of the [[Islamic State]] militant group in Iraq in 2017, and are very rare now.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Twin Suicide Bombings In Baghdad Market Kill At Least 32, Wound Over 100 |url=https://www.npr.org/2021/01/21/959115619/twin-suicide-bombings-in-baghdad-market-kill-and-wound-dozens |access-date=2021-05-23 |publisher=National Public Radio |language=en |archive-date=21 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210521175609/https://www.npr.org/2021/01/21/959115619/twin-suicide-bombings-in-baghdad-market-kill-and-wound-dozens |url-status=live }}</ref>

A major center of [[Islamic history]], the city is known for its [[List of mosques in Baghdad|numerous historic mosques]]. It includes museums such as the [[Iraq Museum]], [[Baghdadi Museum]] and [[Abd al-Karim Qasim Museum]]. Baghdad is also nicknamed as "City of Palaces", as its home to numerous palaces such as [[Abbasid Palace]], [[Radwaniyah Palace]] and [[Al-Faw Palace]]. Previously being multi-religious city, the city is also many [[List of cathedrals in Iraq|churches]], [[Mandi (Mandaeism)|mandis]] and [[List of Jewish sites in Iraq|synagogues]]. Through its airport, Baghdad is known as the "Gateway of Iraq".

==Name==
The name Baghdad is pre-Islamic, and its origin is disputed.<ref name=EI2 /> The site where the city of Baghdad developed has been populated for millennia. Archaeological evidence shows that the site of Baghdad was occupied by various peoples long before the Arab conquest of [[Mesopotamia]] in 637 CE, and several ancient empires had capitals located in the surrounding area.<ref>{{cite web |title=Baghdad, Foundation and early growth |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Baghdad |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009070155/https://www.britannica.com/place/Baghdad |archive-date=9 October 2015 |access-date=21 October 2015 |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |quote=[...] the site located between present-day Al-Kāẓimiyyah and Al-Karkh and occupied by a Persian village called Baghdad, was selected by al-Manṣūr, the second caliph of the Abbāsid dynasty, for his capital.}}</ref>

Other authors have suggested older origins for the name, in particular the name ''Bagdadu'' or ''Hudadu'' that existed in [[Akkadian language|Old Babylonian]] (spelled with a sign that can represent both ''bag'' and ''hu''), and the [[Jewish Babylonian Aramaic]] name of a place called ''Baghdatha'' ({{lang|tmr|בגדתא}}).<ref name=EI2 /><ref>{{cite book |editor1=John Block Friedman |editor2=Kristen Mossler Figg |date=4 July 2013 |title=Trade, Travel, and Exploration in the Middle Ages: An Encyclopedia |publisher=[[Routledge]] |pages= |isbn=978-1-135-59094-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-OmCfNI_SxAC |access-date=23 July 2022 |archive-date=28 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128003749/https://books.google.com/books?id=-OmCfNI_SxAC |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Brinkmann J.a. |date=1968 |title=Political history of Post-Kassite Babylonia (1158-722 b.

Another view, suggested by Christophe Wall-Romana, is that name of "Baghdad" is derived from "[[Akkad (city)|Akkad]]", as the cuneiform logogram for Akkad (𒀀𒂵𒉈𒆠) is pronounced "''a-ga-dè''<sup>KI</sup>" ("Agade") and its resemblance to "Baghdad" is compelling.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Wall-Romana |first=Christophe |date=1990 |title=An Areal Location of Agade |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/546244 |journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=205–245, 244 |doi=10.1086/373442 |jstor=546244 |s2cid=161165836 |issn=0022-2968}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Sallaberger |first=Walther |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43521617 |title=Akkade-Zeit und Ur III-Zeit |date=1999 |publisher=Universitätsverlag |others=Aage Westenholz |isbn=978-3-7278-1210-1 |location=Freiburg, Schweiz |pages=31 |oclc=43521617}}</ref>

When the Abbasid caliph [[al-Mansur]] founded a completely new city for his capital, he chose the name "City of Peace" ({{langx|ar|مدینة السلام|links=no|translit=Madīnat as-Salām}}), which now refers to the [[Round City of Baghdad]] proper. This was the official name on coins, weights, and other official usage, although the common people continued to use the old name.<ref name="ما معنى اسم مدينة بغداد ومن سماه ؟">{{cite web |url=http://seenjeem.maktoob.com/question?category_id=4&level=L2&question_id=9510 |archive-url= https://archive.today/20120713093613/http://seenjeem.maktoob.com/question?category_id=4&level=L2&question_id=9510 |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 July 2012 |title=ما معنى اسم مدينة بغداد ومن سماه ؟ |publisher=Seenjeem.maktoob.com |access-date=27 April 2010}}</ref><ref name="ejabat.google.com">{{cite web |title=ما معنى (بغداد)؟ العراق العالم العربي الجغرافيا |url=http://ejabat.google.com/ejabat/thread?tid=6981074380f32f74 |website=[[Google Questions and Answers|Google Ejabat]] |access-date=27 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229160415/http://ejabat.google.com/ejabat/thread?tid=6981074380f32f74 |archive-date=29 December 2013 |language=ar}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2017}} By the 11th century, ''Baghdad'' became almost the exclusive name for the world-renowned metropolis.

After the fall of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], the first Muslim dynasty, the victorious [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] rulers wanted their own capital from which they could rule. They chose a site north of the [[Sassanid]] capital of [[Ctesiphon]], and on 30 July 762<ref>{{cite book |last=Corzine |first=Phyllis |title=The Islamic Empire |year=2005 |publisher=Thomson Gale |pages=68–69}}</ref> the [[caliph]] [[Al-Mansur]] commissioned the construction of the city.

The city's growth was helped by its excellent location, based on at least two factors: it had control over strategic and trading routes along the [[Tigris]], and it had an abundance of water in a dry climate. Water exists on both the north and south ends of the city, allowing all households to have a plentiful supply, which was quite uncommon during this time. The city of Baghdad quickly became so large that it had to be divided into three judicial districts: Madinat al-Mansur (the Round City), al-Sharqiyya ([[Karkh|al-Karkh]]) and Askar al-Mahdi (on the West Bank).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tillier |first=Mathieu |title=Les cadis d'Iraq et l'État Abbasside (132/750-334/945) |date=2009 |publisher=Presses de l'Ifpo |doi=10.4000/books.ifpo.673 |isbn=978-2-35159-028-7}}</ref> Al-Mansur also planned out al-Karkh district so that he could separate the markets from the Round City in order to keep the turbulent populace away from the Round City to ensure that the gates would not be open at night for markets. Over time, the markets became diverse and a home to merchants and craftsmen. Officials with the title of “Muhtasib” were hired to look after markets to prevent cheating and check the weighs and measures of stocks.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bosworth |first=Clifford Edmund |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UB4uSVt3ulUC |title=Historic Cities of the Islamic World |date=2007-01-01 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-15388-2 |language=en}}</ref>

Baghdad eclipsed Ctesiphon, the capital of the Sassanians, which was located some {{cvt|30|km|mi}} to the southeast. Today, all that remains of Ctesiphon is the shrine town of [[Salman Pak]], just to the south of Greater Baghdad which is where [[Salman the Persian]] is believed to have been buried. Ctesiphon itself had replaced and absorbed [[Seleucia]], the first capital of the [[Seleucid Empire]], which had earlier replaced the city of Babylon.

The basic framework of the city consists of two large semicircles about {{cvt|19|km|mi}} in diameter. The inner city connecting them was designed as a circle about {{cvt|2|km}} in diameter, leading it to be known as the "Round City".

The purpose or use of the remaining space in the center is unknown. The circular design of the city was a direct reflection of the traditional Near Eastern [[urban planning|urban design]]. The Sasanian city of [[Firuzabad, Fars|Gur]] in [[Fars Province|Fars]], built 500 years before Baghdad, is nearly identical in its general circular design, radiating avenues, and the government buildings and temples at the center of the city. Much earlier, circular cities had existed in the Syro-Mesopotamian heartland, one of the better-known examples being [[Mari,_Syria|Mari]], while [[Tell Chuera]] and [[Al-Rawda_(tell)|Tell al-Rawda]] also provide examples of this type of urban planning existing in bronze age [[Syria_(region)|Syria]]. This style of urban planning contrasted with Ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] urban planning, in which cities are designed as squares or rectangles with streets intersecting each other at right angles. 

Baghdad was a hectic city during the day and had many attractions at night. There were cabarets and taverns, halls for backgammon and chess, live plays, concerts, and acrobats. On street corners, storytellers engaged crowds with tales such as those later told in Arabian Nights.<ref name="Bobrick 2012 67"/> Storytelling became a profession called "[[al-Qaskhun]]" which survived until the modern era.<ref>{{Cite web |title=بالصور.. أبو تحسين آخر حكواتي في بغداد |url=https://www.aljazeera.net/culture/2019/5/16/%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b9%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%82-%d8%a8%d8%ba%d8%af%d8%a7%d8%af-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%82%d8%b5%d8%ae%d9%88%d9%86-%d8%ad%d9%83%d9%88%d8%a7%d8%aa%d9%8a-%d9%85%d9%82%d9%87%d9%89 |access-date=2024-04-29 |website=الجزيرة نت |language=ar}}</ref>[[File:Niebuhr1778bd2 Baghdad.jpg|thumb|Contemporary sketch of Baghdad published by [[Carsten Niebuhr]] in 1778]]
The four surrounding walls of Baghdad were named [[Kufa]], [[Basra]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], and [[Syria]]; named because [[Gates of Baghdad|their gates]] pointed in the directions of these destinations. The distance between these gates was a little less than {{cvt|1.5|mi|km|order=flip}}. Each gate had double doors that were made of iron; the doors were so heavy it took several men to open and close them. The wall itself was about 44&nbsp;m thick at the base and about 12&nbsp;m thick at the top. Also, the wall was 30&nbsp;m high, which included [[merlon]]s, a solid part of an embattled parapet usually pierced by [[embrasure]]s. This wall was surrounded by another wall with a thickness of 50&nbsp;m. The second wall had towers and rounded merlons, which surrounded the towers. This outer wall was protected by a solid [[glacis]], which is made out of bricks and [[quicklime]]. Beyond the outer wall was a water-filled moat.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The Golden Gate Palace, the residence of the caliph and his family, was in the heart of Baghdad, in the central square. In the central part of the building, there was a green dome that was 39m high. Surrounding the palace was an [[esplanade]], a waterside building, in which only the caliph could come riding on horseback. In addition, the palace was near other mansions and officer's residences. Near the Gate of Syria, a building served as the home for the guards. It was made of brick and marble. The palace governor lived in the latter part of the building and the commander of the guards in the front. In 813, after the death of caliph [[Al-Amin]], the palace was no longer used as the home for the caliph and his family.{{sfn|Wiet|1971|p=15}} The roundness points to the fact that it was based on [[Arabic script]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Islam Art and Architecture |first=Markus |last=Hattstein |author2=Peter Delius |year=2000 |page=96 |isbn=978-3-8290-2558-4 |publisher=Könemann |location=Cologne}}</ref><ref>''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'', [[Columbia University]], p.413.</ref> The two designers who were hired by [[Al-Mansur]] to plan the city's design were [[Naubakht]], a Zoroastrian who also determined that the date of the foundation of the city would be astrologically auspicious, and [[Mashallah ibn Athari|Mashallah]], a Jew from [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]], [[Iran]].<ref name="ref2">{{cite book |title=Islamic Science and Engineering |first=Donald R. |last=Hill |year=1994 |page=10 |isbn=978-0-7486-0457-9 |publisher=Edinburgh Univ.

Among the notable features of Baghdad during this period were its exceptional libraries. Many of the Abbasid caliphs were patrons of learning and enjoyed collecting both ancient and contemporary literature. Although some of the princes of the previous Umayyad dynasty had begun to gather and translate Greek scientific literature, the Abbasids were the first to foster Greek learning on a large scale. Many of these libraries were private collections intended only for the use of the owners and their immediate friends, but the libraries of the caliphs and other officials soon took on a public or a semi-public character.<ref name=mackensen>Mackensen, Ruth Stellhorn .

University of Chicago Press.</ref> Four great libraries were established in Baghdad during this period. The earliest was that of the famous [[Al-Ma'mun]], who was caliph from 813 to 833. Another was established by [[Sabur ibn Ardashir]] in 991 or 993 for the literary men and scholars who frequented his academy.<ref name=mackensen/> This second library was plundered and burned by the Seljuks only seventy years after it was established. This was a good example of the sort of library built up out of the needs and interests of a literary society.<ref name=mackensen/> The last two were examples of ''madrasa'' or theological college libraries. The [[Nezamiyeh]] was founded by the Persian [[Nizam al-Mulk]], who was vizier of two early Seljuk sultans.<ref name=mackensen/> It continued to operate even after the coming of the Mongols in 1258. The [[Mustansiriya Madrasah|Mustansiriyah ''madrasa'']], which owned an exceedingly rich library, was founded by [[Al-Mustansir (Baghdad)|Al-Mustansir]], the second last Abbasid caliph, who died in 1242.<ref name=mackensen/> This would prove to be the last great library built by the caliphs of Baghdad.

Under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], Baghdad continued into a [[History of Baghdad (1831–1917)|period of decline]], partially as a result of the enmity between its rulers and [[Iran]]ian [[Safavids]], which did not accept the [[Sunni]] control of the city.

Direct Ottoman rule was reimposed by [[Ali Rıza Pasha (governor of Baghdad)|Ali Rıza Pasha]] in 1831.

==Geography==
The city is located on a vast plain bisected by the [[Tigris]] river. The Tigris splits Baghdad in half, with the eastern half being called "[[Al-Rusafa, Iraq|Risafa]]" and the Western half known as "[[Karkh]]". The land on which the city is built is almost entirely flat and low-lying, being of [[quaternary]] [[alluvium|alluvial]] origin due to the periodic large floods which have occurred on the river.

== Governance ==
{{see also|List of neighborhoods and districts in Baghdad}}
[[File:Bagdad-sat.JPG|thumb|Baghdad as seen from the [[International Space Station]]]]

Administratively, Baghdad Governorate is divided into [[Kaza|districts]] which are further divided into [[nahiyah|sub-districts]].<ref name=":4" /> Municipally, the governorate is divided into 9 municipalities, which have responsibility for local issues.<ref name=":4" /> Regional services, however, are coordinated and carried out by a mayor who oversees the municipalities.<ref name=":4" /> The governorate council is responsible for the governorate-wide policy.<ref name=":4" /> These official subdivisions of the city served as administrative centers for the delivery of municipal services but until 2003 had no political function.<ref name=":4" /> Beginning in April 2003, the U.S. controlled [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] (CPA) began the process of creating new functions for these.<ref name=":4" /> The process initially focused on the election of neighborhood councils in the official neighborhoods, elected by neighborhood caucuses.<ref name=":4" /> The CPA convened a series of meetings in each neighborhood to explain local government, to describe the caucus election process and to encourage participants to spread the word and bring friends, relatives and neighbors to subsequent meetings.<ref name=":4" />

Each neighborhood process ultimately ended with a final meeting where candidates for the new neighborhood councils identified themselves and asked their neighbors to vote for them. Once all 88 (later increased to 89) neighborhood councils were in place, each neighborhood council elected representatives from among their members to serve on one of the city's nine district councils. The number of neighborhood representatives on a district council is based upon the neighborhood's population. The next step was to have each of the nine district councils elect representatives from their membership to serve on the 37 member Baghdad City Council. This three tier system of local government connected the people of Baghdad to the central government through their representatives from the neighborhood, through the district, and up to the city council. The same process was used to provide representative councils for the other communities in Baghdad Province outside of the city itself. There, local councils were elected from 20 neighborhoods (''Nahia'') and these councils elected representatives from their members to serve on six district councils (''Qada'').

As within the city, the district councils then elected representatives from among their members to serve on the 35 member Baghdad Regional Council. The first step in the establishment of the system of local government for Baghdad Province was the election of the Baghdad Provincial Council. As before, the representatives to the Provincial Council were elected by their peers from the lower councils in numbers proportional to the population of the districts they represent. The 41 member Provincial Council took office in February 2004 and served until national elections held in January 2005, when a new Provincial Council was elected. This system of 127 separate councils may seem overly cumbersome; however, Baghdad Province is home to approximately seven million people. At the lowest level, the neighborhood councils, each council represents an average of 75,000 people. The nine District Advisory Councils (DAC) are as follows:<ref name=":4">{{cite news |title=New troops to move into Iraq |url=http://images.usatoday.com/news/graphics/troop_surge/flash.swf |work=USA Today |access-date=22 April 2007 |archive-date=5 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070605012753/http://images.usatoday.com/news/graphics/troop_surge/flash.swf |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Planned Baghdad Metro ===
{{Main|Baghdad Metro}}

The Baghdad Metro project was first proposed during the 1970s but did not come into fruition due to wars and sanctions. After the Iraq war, Iraqi authorities intended to revive the project, but it was again delayed due to domestic instability.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/18/iraq-baghdad-underground-train-network|title=Baghdad goes underground with $3bn metro plan|publisher=TheGuardian}}</ref> In 2019, it was reported that Korean [[Hyundai Rotem|Hyundai]] and French [[Alstom]] would be commencing construction of the project.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Staff Writer |last2=Projects |first2=Zawya |title=Iraq approves 2023 budget funds for Baghdad metro |url=https://www.zawya.com/en/projects/construction/iraq-approves-2023-budget-funds-for-baghdad-metro-fzub7skp |access-date=2023-07-17 |website=www.zawya.com |language=en}}</ref> However, the planned construction did not happen.

As of February 2024, the current plan consist of fully electric and automated (driverless) trains running on an extensive railway network consisting of an underground railway portion as well as an elevated railway. The proposed Baghdad Metro system includes seven main lines with a total length of more than 148 kilometres, 64 metro stations, four workshops and depots for trains, several operations control centers (OCC) and seven main power stations (MPS) with a capacity of 250 mega-watts, and several Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) towers. The metro will be equipped with CCTV and internet as well as USB ports for charging. Special compartments will be allocated for women and children as well as seats for people with special needs, pregnant women, and the elderly. The metro stations will be connected to other public transport networks such as buses and taxis, and 10 parking spaces will be available for commuters. The planned operating speed will be 80–140&nbsp;km/hour with an estimated 3.25 million riders per day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://investpromo.gov.iq/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3.-RFI-English-%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%B0%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%88-%D8%A8%D8%BA%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF-E-20.2.2024.pdf|title=Baghdad Metro Rail Project|publisher=Investpromo.gov.iq}}</ref>

Baghdad has always played a significant role in the broader [[Arab culture|Arab cultural sphere]], contributing several significant writers, musicians and visual artists. Famous [[Arab]] poets and singers such as [[Nizar Qabbani]], [[Umm Kulthum]], [[Fairuz]], [[Salah Al-Hamdani]], [[Ilham al-Madfai]] and others have performed for the city. The dialect of [[Baghdad Arabic|Arabic spoken in Baghdad]] today differs from that of other large urban centers in Iraq, having features more characteristic of nomadic Arabic dialects (Versteegh, ''The Arabic Language''). It is possible that this was caused by the repopulating of the city with rural residents after the multiple sackings of the late [[Middle Ages]]. For poetry written about Baghdad, see [[Reuven Snir]] (ed.), ''Baghdad: The City in Verse'' (Harvard, 2013).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hup.harvard.edu/features/baghdad/ |title=Baghdad: The City in Verse, translated and edited by Reuven Snir |publisher=Harvard University Press |access-date=8 September 2019 |archive-date=19 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190819190324/https://www.hup.harvard.edu/features/baghdad/ |url-status=live}}</ref> Baghdad joined the [[Creative Cities Network|UNESCO Creative Cities Network]] as a City of Literature in December 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Baghdad celebrates selection as UNESCO City of Literature {{!}} Nermeen Mufti |url=https://thearabweekly.com/baghdad-celebrates-selection-unesco-city-literature |access-date=2021-01-25|website=AW|language=en |archive-date=30 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210130145309/https://thearabweekly.com/baghdad-celebrates-selection-unesco-city-literature |url-status=live}}</ref>

Some of the important cultural institutions in the city include the [[National Theater (Iraq)|National Theater]], which was looted during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], but efforts are underway to restore the theater.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://csmonitor.com/2003/0716/p01s04b-woiq.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828071929/http://csmonitor.com/2003/0716/p01s04b-woiq.htm |title=Five women confront a new Iraq &#124; csmonitor.com |website=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |archive-date=28 August 2009}}</ref> The live theater industry received a boost during the 1990s, when UN [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]] limited the import of foreign films.

The [[Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra]] is a government funded symphony orchestra in Baghdad. The INSO plays primarily classical European music, as well as original compositions based on Iraqi and Arab instruments and music. Baghdad is also home to a number of museums which housed [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and relics of [[ancient civilization]]; many of these were stolen, and the museums looted, during the widespread chaos immediately after United States forces entered the city.

During [[Occupation of Iraq (2003–2011)|US occupation of Iraq]], [[AFN Iraq]] ("Freedom Radio") broadcast news and entertainment within Baghdad, among other locations. There is also a private radio station called "Dijlah" (named after the Arabic word for the Tigris River) that was created in 2004 as Iraq's first independent talk radio station. Radio Dijlah offices, in the [[Jamia]] neighborhood of Baghdad, have been attacked on several occasions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dinarrvnews.net/gunmen-iraq-media-attacked/ |title=Gunmen storm independent radio station in latest attack against media in Iraq |work=International Herald Tribune |date=29 March 2009 |access-date=30 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010060435/http://dinarrvnews.net/gunmen-iraq-media-attacked/ |archive-date=10 October 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Sights of interest==
*The [[National Museum of Iraq]] whose collection of artifacts was looted during the 2003 US invasion, and the iconic Hands of Victory arches. Multiple Iraqi parties are in discussions as to whether the arches should remain as historical monuments or be dismantled. Thousands of ancient manuscripts in the [[Iraq National Library and Archive|National Library]] were destroyed under [[Saddam]]'s command.
*[[Mutanabbi Street]] is located near the old quarter of Baghdad; at Al-Rasheed Street. It is the historic center of Baghdadi book-selling, a street filled with bookstores and outdoor book stalls. It was named after the 10th-century classical Iraqi poet [[Al-Mutanabbi]].<ref name="NYTimes2008">{{cite news |title=Then and Now: A New Chapter for Baghdad Book Market |url=http://baghdadbureau.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/then-and-now-a-new-chapter-for-baghdad-book-market/?hp |work=The New York Times |first=Eric |last=Owles |date=18 December 2008 |access-date=19 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221035319/http://baghdadbureau.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/then-and-now-a-new-chapter-for-baghdad-book-market/?hp |archive-date=21 December 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> This street is well established for bookselling and has often been referred to as the heart and soul of the Baghdad literacy and intellectual community.
*[[Baghdad Zoo]] used to be the largest [[zoological park]] in the [[Middle East]]. Within eight days following the 2003 invasion, however, only 35 of the 650 animals in the facility survived. This was a result of theft of some animals for human food, and starvation of caged animals that had no food. Conservationist [[Lawrence Anthony]] and some of the zoo keepers cared for the animals and fed the carnivores with donkeys they had bought locally.<ref name="BBC radio 4, zoo">{{cite news |url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/4a456893b10c4c55a2d0fbda730485c5 |title=''The Choice'', featuring Lawrence Anthony |publisher=[[BBC Radio 4]] |date=4 September 2007 |access-date=4 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010055656/http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/4a456893b10c4c55a2d0fbda730485c5 |archive-date=10 October 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Anthony |first1=Lawrence |author2=Spence Grayham |title=Babylon's Ark; The Incredible Wartime Rescue of the Baghdad Zoo |publisher=[[Thomas Dunne Books]] |date=3 June 2007 |url=https://archive.org/details/babylonsarkincre0000anth |url-access=registration |isbn=978-0-312-35832-7}}</ref> Eventually [[Paul Bremer]], Director of the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] in Iraq after the invasion, ordered protection for the zoo and enlisted U.S. engineers to help reopen the facility.<ref name="BBC radio 4, zoo" />
*[[Grand Festivities Square]] is the main square where public celebrations are held and is also the home to three important monuments commemorating Iraqi's fallen soldiers and victories in war; namely Al-Shaheed Monument, the [[Victory Arch]] and the [[The Monument to the Unknown Soldier|Unknown Soldier's Monument]].<ref>{{citation |last1=Makiya |first1=K. |last2=Al-Khalilm |first2=S. |title=The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Saddam Hussein's Iraq |page=29}}</ref>
*[[Al-Shaheed Monument]], also known as the Martyr's Memorial, is a monument dedicated to the Iraqi soldiers who died in the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. However, now it is generally considered by Iraqis to be for all of the martyrs of Iraq, especially those allied with Iran and Syria fighting ISIS, not just of the Iran–Iraq War. The monument was opened in 1983, and was designed by the Iraqi architect Saman Kamal and the Iraqi sculptor and artist [[Ismail Fatah Al Turk]]. During the 1970s and 1980s, [[Saddam Hussein]]'s government spent a lot of money on new monuments, which included the al-Shaheed Monument.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}
