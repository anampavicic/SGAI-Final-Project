[[File:Robert Parsell Davie 001.jpg|thumb|alt=Robert Parsell Davie- founder of Davie Florida|R.P. Davie]]
Prior to European colonization, the [[Tequesta]] were the [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous people]] of what is now Davie. A few campsites and graves have been found in Davie, the oldest dating back 5,000 to 7,000 years in Pine Island Ridge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1991-08-17-9101310587-story.html|title = Ridge Yields Evidence of Campsite in 5000 B.c.}}</ref> After Spanish colonization, many of the Tequesta died and the remaining few either escaped to [[Havana]] with the Spanish when [[East Florida|Florida became a British colony]], or they assimilated into the newly arrived [[Seminole]]s in the late 18th century.<ref>Tebeau, p.&nbsp;45.</ref>

Davie was previously known as “'''Zona'''”, but within a few years it was given the name “Davie” in gratitude for the school Robert Parsell Davie built and his other contributions.<ref>{{Cite web |date=December 23, 2022 |title=Signs of the past: Meet the remarkable R.P.
