== Etymology ==
Dudhrej was originally a nes ([[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]]) settled by the [[Charan]]as. One ''Shastam Swami'' wanted a [[temple]] to be built on the bank of the tank, so he started a shrine. The Charan ladies of the village would pour [[milk]] (dudh) over a particular place at the shrine due to which the place began to be known as Dudhrej.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gujarat (India) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KU5uAAAAMAAJ |title=Gazetteers: Surendranagar District |date=1977 |publisher=Directorate of Government Print., Stationery and Publications |pages=702 |language=en}}</ref>
