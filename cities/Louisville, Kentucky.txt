== Pronunciation ==
The correct pronunciation of the name of ''Louisville'' is heatedly debated.<ref name="Adams">{{cite news |last=Adams |first=Kirby |url=https://www.courier-journal.com/story/entertainment/2017/06/07/louisville-one-top-cities-americans-mispronounce/371475001/ |title=Do you say it right? Louisville is one of the top cities Americans mispronounce |date=June 7, 2017 |work=[[The Courier-Journal]] |access-date=December 8, 2023}}</ref> The three most popular pronunciations are, in order:

#{{IPAc-en|audio=Loouhvull.ogg|ˈ|l|uː|ə|v|əl}} {{respell|LOO|ə|vəl}},
#{{IPAc-en|audio=Looeevil.ogg|ˈ|l|uː|i|v|ɪ|l}} {{respell|LOO|ee|vil}}, and

The history of Louisville spans hundreds of years, and has been influenced by the area's [[#Geography|geography]] and proximity to the [[Falls of the Ohio River]].

===Early history and founding===

[[File:George Rogers Clark.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.65|alt=Painting of the head and shoulders of an older, gray-haired, balding man in a colonial-era military uniform (blue jacket with white lapels and gold epaullettes)|[[George Rogers Clark]] founded Louisville in the midst of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].]]

Since the Falls created a barrier to river travel, settlements grew at this [[portage]] point. The first European settlement in the vicinity of modern-day Louisville was on [[Corn Island (Kentucky)|Corn Island]] in 1778 by Col. George Rogers Clark, credited as the founder of Louisville. Several landmarks in the community are named after him.<ref>{{cite web|title=George Rogers Clark: Kentucky Frontiersman, Hero, and Founder of Louisville|publisher=Kentucky Department for Libraries and Archives|url=http://www.kdla.ky.gov/resources/kygrclark.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070425213827/http://www.kdla.ky.gov/resources/KYGRClark.htm|archive-date=April 25, 2007|access-date=July 19, 2007}}</ref>

Two years later, in 1780, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] approved the town charter of Louisville. The city was named in honor of King [[Louis XVI]] of France, whose soldiers were then [[France in the American Revolutionary War|aiding Americans in the Revolutionary War]]. Early residents lived in [[Fort Nelson (Kentucky)|forts]] to protect themselves from raids from the local indigenous population, but they moved out by the late 1780s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Two Hundred Years at the Fall of the Ohio: A History of Louisville and Jefferson County |last=Yater |first=George H. |year=1987 |publisher=[[The Filson Historical Society|Filson Club, Incorporated]] |location=Louisville, Kentucky |edition=2nd |pages=9–10 |isbn = 978-0-9601072-3-0}}</ref> In 1803, explorers [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark]] organized their [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|expedition across America]] in the town of [[Clarksville, Indiana]] at the present-day Falls of the Ohio opposite Louisville, Kentucky.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition|url=http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/read/?_xmlsrc=introduction.general.xml&_xslsrc=LCstyles.xsl|access-date=July 30, 2009|archive-date=May 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517182106/http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/read/?_xmlsrc=introduction.general.xml&_xslsrc=LCstyles.xsl|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Lewis and Clark—Falls of the Ohio|url=http://www.in.gov/dnr/lewis-clark/falls/|access-date=July 30, 2009|archive-date=February 17, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217165128/http://www.in.gov/dnr/lewis-clark/falls/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The city's early growth was influenced by the fact that river boats had to be unloaded and moved downriver before reaching the falls. By 1828, the population had grown to 7,000 and Louisville became an incorporated city.<ref>Yater, pp. 46–48.</ref>

Early Louisville was a major shipping port and [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved African Americans]] worked in a variety of associated trades.<ref name="Kleber Slavery">{{cite book |last=O'Brien |first=Mary Lawrence Bickett |editor-first=John E. |editor-last=Kleber |year=2001 |title=The Encyclopedia of Louisville |chapter=Slavery in Louisville 1820–1860 |pages=825–826 |publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]] |location=[[Lexington, Kentucky]] |isbn=0-8131-2100-0 |oclc=247857447 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pXbYITw4ZesC |access-date=May 14, 2015 |archive-date=March 13, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230313151808/https://books.google.com/books?id=pXbYITw4ZesC |url-status=live }}</ref> The city was often a point of escape for [[fugitive slaves]] to the north, as Indiana was a free state.<ref name="Kleber Slavery" /><ref>{{cite web |last=Hudson |first=J.

During this point in the 1850s, the city was growing and vibrant, but that also came with negativity. It was the center of planning, supplies, recruiting, and transportation for numerous campaigns, especially in the [[Western Theater]]. Ethnic tensions rose, and on August 6, 1855, known as "[[Bloody Monday]]", Protestant mobs attacked German and Irish Catholic neighborhoods on election day, resulting in 22 deaths and widespread property damage.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bloody Monday Memorial |url=https://www.louisvilleirish.com/bloody-monday-memorial/ |access-date=September 9, 2022 |website=Ancient Order of Hibernians|archive-date=September 9, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220909105328/https://www.louisvilleirish.com/bloody-monday-memorial/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Then by 1861, the civil war had broken out.

===20th and 21st centuries===
Following the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation, freed slaves settled in a neighborhood of Louisville called Little Africa, nicknamed "the gateway to the South," near the present neighborhood of [[Park DuValle, Louisville|Park DuValle]].<ref name="WHAS">{{Cite web|date=February 14, 2021|title=What happened to Little Africa?

In 1914, the city of Louisville passed a racially based residential zoning code, following Baltimore, Atlanta, and a handful of cities in the Carolinas.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Residential Segregation by Law, 1910–1917|first=Roger L.|last= Rice|journal=The Journal of Southern History|volume=34|issue=2|date=May 1968|pages=181–183|doi=10.2307/2204656|jstor=2204656}}</ref> The [[NAACP]] challenged the ordinance in two cases. Two weeks after the ordinance enacted, an African-American named Arthur Harris moved into a house on a block designated for whites. He was prosecuted and found guilty. The second case was planned to create a test case. [[William Warley]], the president of the local chapter of the NAACP, tendered a purchase offer on a white block from Charles Buchanan, a white real estate agent. Warley also wrote a letter declaring his intention to build a house on that lot and reside there. With the understanding that the Louisville ordinance made it illegal for him to live there, Warley withheld payment, setting in motion a breach of contract suit by Buchanan.<ref>Rice (1968), pp. 185–186.</ref> By 1917 the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case of ''[[Buchanan v. Warley]]''. The court struck down the Louisville residential segregation ordinance, ruling that it violated the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]'s [[due process]] clause.<ref>Rice (1968), p. 194.</ref>

In 1917, shortly after the United States' entry into [[World War I]], Louisville was selected as the site of Camp Zachary Taylor. Camp Taylor was one of the country's largest World War I training camps. It was home of the 84th Infantry Division and trained over 150,000 men by the end of war, including [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]. The camp was closed in 1921. Many of the buildings and infrastructure in the Camp Taylor neighborhood of Louisville are there as a result of the training camp.

In 1929, Louisville completed the [[McAlpine Locks and Dam|lock and dam]] in the [[Falls of the Ohio]] and the city began referring to itself as "where Northern enterprise and [[Southern hospitality]] meet". Between the industrial boom of that year and through the [[Great Depression]], Louisville gained 15,000 new residents, about 3% of them black, most fleeing poverty in rural areas.<ref name="Adams-2001">{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=Luther J.|date=Autumn 2001|title=African American Migration to Louisville in the Mid-Twentieth Century|journal=The Register of the Kentucky Historical Society|volume=99|issue=4|pages=363–384|jstor=23384797}}</ref>

Throughout January 1937, {{convert|19.17|in|cm}} of rain fell in Louisville, and by January 27, the Ohio River crested at a record {{convert|57.15|ft|m}}, almost {{convert|30|ft|m}} above flood stage. These events triggered the [[Ohio River flood of 1937|"Great Flood of 1937"]], which lasted into early February. The [[flood]] submerged 60–70 percent of the city, caused complete loss of power for four days, and forced the evacuation of 175,000 or 230,000 residents, depending on sources. Ninety people died as a result of the flood.<ref>{{cite book |last=Purcell |first=Aaron D. |editor-first=John E. |editor-last=Kleber |year=2001 |title=The Encyclopedia of Louisville |chapter=Flood of 1937 |pages=296–297 |publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]] |location=[[Lexington, Kentucky]] |isbn=978-0-8131-2100-0 |oclc=247857447 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pXbYITw4ZesC&pg=PA296 |access-date=March 7, 2019 |archive-date=November 6, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231106012909/https://books.google.com/books?id=pXbYITw4ZesC&pg=PA296#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://kyclim.wku.edu/factSheets/ohioRiver.htm |title=Fact Sheet: Ohio River Floods |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080604134934/http://kyclim.wku.edu/factSheets/ohioRiver.htm |publisher=[[Western Kentucky University]] |archive-date=June 4, 2008 |access-date=August 10, 2015 }}</ref> It led to dramatic changes in where residents lived.

Louisville was a center for factory war production during World War II. In May 1942, the U.S. government assigned the [[Curtiss-Wright]] Aircraft Company, a war plant located at Louisville's air field, for wartime aircraft production. The factory produced the [[C-46 Commando]] cargo plane, among other aircraft. In 1946, the factory was sold to [[International Harvester]], which began large-scale production of tractors and agricultural equipment. In 1950, the Census Bureau reported Louisville's population as 84.3% white and 15.6% black.<ref>{{cite web|title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 12, 2012 }}</ref>

Throughout the 1940s, there were more black [[police officer]]s than any other Southern city, though they were allowed to patrol only black districts. This, in part, made Louisville seem like a more racially progressive city than other Southern cities, although only when black citizens accepted a lower status than white citizens. Many historians have referred to this "veil" of segregation as a [[Covert racism|"polite" racism]]. Historian George Wright stated that polite racism "often deluded both blacks and well-meaning whites into believing that real progress was being made in their city". For example, in the city [[Jim Crow]] practices were not maintained by law so much as by custom.<ref name="Adams-2001" />

Similar to many other older American cities, Louisville began to experience a movement of people and businesses to the suburbs in the 1960s and 1970s. Middle class residents used newly built freeways and interstate highways to commute to work, moving into more distant but newer housing. Because of tax laws, businesses found it cheaper to build new rather than renovate older buildings. Economic changes included a decline in local manufacturing. The West End and older areas of the South End, in particular, began to decline economically as many local factories closed.

In 1974, a major (F4) tornado hit Louisville as part of the [[1974 Super Outbreak]] of tornadoes that struck 13 states.

Since the 1980s, many of the city's urban neighborhoods have been [[gentrification|revitalized]] into areas popular with young professionals and college students.

Louisville is southeasterly situated along the border between Kentucky and [[Indiana]], the [[Ohio River]], in north-central Kentucky at the [[Falls of the Ohio]]. Louisville is an [[Upper South]] city located in a [[Southern United States|Southern state]] that is influenced by both [[Culture of the Southern United States|Southern]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern culture]]. It is sometimes referred to as either one of the northernmost Southern cities or as one of the southernmost Northern cities in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Meyer |first=David R. |date=December 1989 |title=Midwestern Industrialization and the American Manufacturing Belt in the Nineteenth Century |journal=The Journal of Economic History |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=921–937 |jstor=2122744 |doi=10.1017/S0022050700009505 |s2cid=154436086 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.emporis.com/city/louisville-ky-usa |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120604051110/http://www.emporis.com/city/louisville-ky-usa |url-status = dead |archive-date = June 4, 2012 |title=Emporis:Louisville, KY |access-date=February 6, 2007}}</ref>

Much of the city is located on a very wide and flat [[floodplain]] surrounded by hill country on all sides. Much of the area was swampland that had to be drained as the city grew. In the 1840s, most creeks were rerouted or placed in canals to prevent flooding and disease outbreaks.

Areas generally east of [[Interstate 65 in Kentucky|I-65]] are above the flood plain, and are composed of gently rolling hills. The southernmost parts of Jefferson County are in the scenic and largely undeveloped [[Knobs region]], which is home to [[Jefferson Memorial Forest]].

The [[Louisville-Jefferson County, KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA), the [[List of Metropolitan Statistical Areas|43rd largest]] in the United States,{{efn|name=MSAnote}}<ref name="PopEstMSA"/> includes the Kentucky county of Jefferson ([[wikt:coterminous|coterminous]] with Louisville Metro), plus twelve outlying counties—seven in Kentucky and five in [[Southern Indiana]]. Louisville's MSA is included in the [[Louisville–Elizabethtown–Madison, KY–IN Combined Statistical Area]] (CSA), which also includes the [[Elizabethtown, KY]] MSA, as well as the [[Madison, IN]] [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]].

The Louisville area is near several other urban areas, especially [[Frankfort, Kentucky]] (the state's capital); [[Cincinnati]], Ohio (the two cities' metropolitan statistical areas almost border each other); [[Lexington, Kentucky]]; [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]]; [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; and the [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] area (especially [[Columbus, Indiana]], to the north of Southern Indiana).

Louisville's late 19th- and early 20th-century development was spurred by three large suburban parks built at the edges of the city in 1890.

Since the mid-20th century, Louisville has in some ways been divided into three sides of town: the West End, the South End, and the East End. In 2003, Bill Dakan, a [[University of Louisville]] geography professor, said that the West End, west of 7th Street and north of Algonquin Parkway, is "a [[euphemism]] for the African American part of town" although he points out that this belief is not entirely true, and most African Americans no longer live in areas where more than 80% of residents are black. Nevertheless, he says the perception is still strong.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]] |title=Will old names work in 'new' city? |last=Pike |first=Bill |page=1N |date=January 23, 2003}}</ref> The South End has long had a reputation as a white, [[working-class]] part of town, while the East End has been seen as middle and [[upper class]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Read all about it: Valley has city united |author=Forde, Pat |date=August 26, 2002 |newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]]}}</ref>

According to the Greater Louisville Association of Realtors, the area with the lowest median home sales price is west of Interstate 65, in the West and South Ends. The middle range of home sales prices are between Interstates 64 and 65 in the South and East Ends, and the highest median home sales price are north of Interstate 64 in the East End.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courier_journal/access/1727307131.html?FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:FT&type=current&date=Jun+29,+2007&author=&pub=Courier+-+Journal&edition=&startpage=A.2&desc=Clarification |title=''The Courier-Journal'' 2006–07 Kentuckiana Guide |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=June 29, 2007 |access-date=August 15, 2011 |archive-date=June 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629001249/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courier_journal/access/1727307131.html?FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:FT&type=current&date=Jun+29,+2007&author=&pub=Courier+-+Journal&edition=&startpage=A.2&desc=Clarification |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Immigrants]] from [[Southeast Asia]] tend to settle in the South End, while immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]] settle in the East End.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[Jefferson Community and Technical College|Jefferson Community College]] |title=Continuity and Change in Louisville's Ethnic Communities |last=Cummins |first=Peggy}}</ref>

Louisville today is home to [[List of companies and organizations based in Louisville|dozens of companies and organizations]] across several [[industrial classification]]s. However, the underpinning of the city's economy since its earliest days has been the shipping and cargo industries. Its strategic location at the Falls of the Ohio, as well as its unique position in the central United States (within one day's road travel to 60 percent of the cities in the continental U.S.) make it a practical location for the transfer of cargo along its route to other destinations.<ref>{{cite book |title=Louisville Survey: Central Report |year=1978 |last=Kramer |first=Carl |page=32}}</ref> The [[Louisville and Portland Canal]] and the [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]] were important links in water and rail transportation.

===Indie scene===

A Louisville locale that highlights the city's indie scene is [[Bardstown Road]], an area located in the heart of the [[The Highlands, Louisville|Highlands]].

Louisville Metro has 122 city [[park]]s covering more than {{convert|13000|acre|km2}}. Several of these parks were designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], who also designed New York City's [[Central Park]] as well as parks, parkways, college campuses and public facilities in many U.S. locations. The [[Louisville Waterfront Park]] is prominently located on the banks of the [[Ohio River]] near downtown and features large open areas, which often hold free [[concert]]s and other [[festival]]s. The [[Big Four Bridge]], a former railroad bridge spanning {{convert|547|ft|m}} but is now a pedestrian bridge connecting Waterfront Park with Jeffersonville, Indiana's waterfront park, fully opened in May 2014 with the completion of Jeffersonville's ramp.<ref>{{cite news|title=Big Four Bridge walkway about to be a step closer|newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]]|date=May 16, 2007|author=Shafer, Sheldon}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Lord, Joseph |title=Indiana Side of Big Four Bridge Is Opening This Afternoon |url=http://wfpl.org/post/indiana-side-big-four-bridge-opening-afternoon |publisher=[[WFPL]] |date=May 20, 2014 |access-date=June 22, 2014 |archive-date=July 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717202926/http://wfpl.org/post/indiana-side-big-four-bridge-opening-afternoon |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Cherokee Park]], one of the most visited parks in the nation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tpl.org/content_documents/citypark_facts/ccpe_Most_Visited_Parks_08.pdf |title=America's Most Visited City Parks |date=October 1, 2008 |access-date=March 31, 2009 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5fgh5pn16?url=http://www.tpl.org/content_documents/citypark_facts/ccpe_Most_Visited_Parks_08.pdf |archive-date=March 31, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> features a {{convert|2.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} mixed-use loop and many well-known landscaping and architectural features including the [[Hogan's Fountain Pavilion]].

[[Otter Creek Outdoor Recreation Area]], owned and operated by the [[Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources]], is another large park in nearby [[Brandenburg, Kentucky]]. The park's namesake, Otter Creek, winds along the eastern side of the park. A scenic bend in the [[Ohio River]], which divides Kentucky from [[Indiana]], can be seen from northern overlooks within the park.

Other outdoor points of interest in the Louisville area include [[Cave Hill Cemetery]] (the burial location of [[Col. Harland Sanders]]), [[Zachary Taylor National Cemetery]] (the burial location of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Zachary Taylor]]), the [[Louisville Zoo]] and the [[Falls of the Ohio National Wildlife Conservation Area]].

In development is the [[City of Parks]], a project to create a {{convert|110|mi|adj=on}} continuous paved pedestrian and biking trail called the [[Louisville Loop]] around Louisville Metro while also adding a large amount of park land. Current plans call for making approximately {{convert|4000|acre|km2}} of the [[Floyds Fork]] flood plain in eastern [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]] into a new park system called [[The Parklands of Floyds Fork]], expanding area in the Jefferson Memorial Forest, and adding riverfront land and wharfs along the Riverwalk and the Levee Trail, both completed segments of the Louisville Loop.

Interstates [[Interstate 64 in Kentucky|I{{nbhyph}}64]] and [[Interstate 65 in Kentucky|I{{nbhyph}}65]] pass through Louisville, and [[Interstate 71#Kentucky|I-71]] has its southern terminus in Louisville. Since all three of these highways intersect at virtually the same location on the east side of [[downtown Louisville|downtown]], this spot has become known as "[[Kennedy Interchange|Spaghetti Junction]]". Three bridges carry I{{nbhyph}}64 and I{{nbhyph}}65 over the Ohio River, and a [[George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge|fourth automobile bridge]] carries non-interstate traffic, including bicyclists and pedestrians. Immediately east of downtown is the [[Big Four Bridge]], a former railroad bridge that has been renovated into as a pedestrian bridge.

The [[Ohio River Bridges Project]], a plan under consideration for decades to construct two new interstate bridges over the Ohio River to connect Louisville to Indiana, including a reconfiguration of Spaghetti Junction, began construction in 2012.<ref>{{cite news |author=Collier, Rachel |title=Construction to begin soon on The Ohio River Bridges Project |url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/19370142/construction-to-begin-soon-on-the-ohio-river-bridges-project |publisher=[[WDRB]] |date=August 24, 2012 |access-date=June 22, 2014 |archive-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006081807/http://www.wdrb.com/story/19370142/construction-to-begin-soon-on-the-ohio-river-bridges-project |url-status=live }}</ref> One bridge, the [[Abraham Lincoln Bridge]], is located downtown beside the existing [[John F.

Louisville's main airport is the centrally located [[Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport]], whose [[IATA Airport code]] (SDF) reflects its former name of Standiford Field. The airport is also home to [[United Parcel Service|UPS]]'s [[Worldport (UPS air hub)|Worldport]] global air hub. UPS operates its largest package-handling hub at Louisville International Airport and bases its [[UPS Airlines]] division there. Over 4.2&nbsp;million passengers and over 4.7&nbsp;billion pounds (2,350,000 t) of cargo pass through the airport each year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transtats.bts.gov/airports.asp?pn=1&Airport=SDF&Airport_Name=Louisville,%20KY:%20Louisville%20International-Standiford%20Field&carrier=FACTS |title=Louisville, KY: Louisville International-Standiford Field (SDF) |date=March 2014 |access-date=July 6, 2014 |archive-date=September 24, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180924165712/https://www.transtats.bts.gov/airports.asp?pn=1 |url-status=live }}</ref> It is also the second busiest airport in the United States in terms of cargo traffic, and fourth busiest for such in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aci.aero/News/Releases/Most-Recent/2014/03/31/Preliminary-World-Airport-Traffic-and-Rankings-2013--High-Growth-Dubai-Moves-Up-to-7th-Busiest-Airport- |title=Preliminary World Airport Traffic and Rankings 2013—High Growth Dubai Moves Up to 7th Busiest Airport |date=March 31, 2014 |access-date=July 6, 2014 |publisher=Airports Council International |archive-date=April 1, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401052319/http://www.aci.aero/News/Releases/Most-Recent/2014/03/31/Preliminary-World-Airport-Traffic-and-Rankings-2013--High-Growth-Dubai-Moves-Up-to-7th-Busiest-Airport- |url-status=live }}</ref> Only about 35 minutes from [[Fort Knox]], the airport is also a major hub for armed services personnel. The historic but smaller [[Bowman Field (Kentucky)|Bowman Field]] is used mainly for [[general aviation]] while nearby [[Clark Regional Airport]] is used mostly by private jets.

The [[McAlpine Locks and Dam]] is located on the Kentucky side of the Ohio River, near the downtown area. The locks were constructed to allow shipping past the [[Falls of the Ohio]].

[[Public transportation]] consists mainly of buses run by the [[Transit Authority of River City]] (TARC). The city buses serve all parts of downtown Louisville and [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]], as well as Kentucky suburbs in [[Oldham County, Kentucky|Oldham County]], [[Bullitt County]], and the [[Indiana]] suburbs of Jeffersonville, [[Clarksville, Indiana|Clarksville]] and [[New Albany, Indiana|New Albany]]. In addition to regular city buses, transit throughout the downtown hotel and shopping districts is served by a fleet of [[Zero-emissions vehicle|zero-emissions buses]] called LouLift. In late 2014, these vehicles replaced the series of motorized trolleys known as the ''Toonerville II Trolley''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gee|first1=Dawne|title=TARC replaces trolleys with ZeroBus|url=http://www.wave3.com/story/27690555/tarc-replaces-trolleys-with-zerobus|access-date=September 29, 2015|publisher=[[WAVE (TV)|WAVE]]|date=December 22, 2014|archive-date=October 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001092733/http://www.wave3.com/story/27690555/tarc-replaces-trolleys-with-zerobus|url-status=live}}</ref> A [[light rail]] system has been studied and proposed for the city, but no plan was in development as of 2007.<ref>{{cite news |first=Marcus |last=Green |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courier_journal/access/1749372341.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Nov+29%2C+2006&author=&pub=Courier+-+Journal&edition=&startpage=B.1&desc=Mass+transit+plan+still+possible |title=Mass transit plan still possible; Officials will look for financing options |newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]] |date=November 29, 2006 |access-date=January 23, 2007 |archive-date=June 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624085522/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courier_journal/access/1749372341.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Nov+29%2C+2006&author=&pub=Courier+-+Journal&edition=&startpage=B.1&desc=Mass+transit+plan+still+possible |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Louisville has historically been a major center for [[railway]] traffic. The [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]] was once headquartered here, before it was purchased by [[CSX Transportation]]. Today the city is served by two major freight railroads, CSX (with a major [[classification yard]] in the southern part of the metro area) and [[Norfolk Southern]]. Five major main lines connect Louisville to the rest of the region. Two regional railroads, the [[Paducah and Louisville Railway]] and the [[Louisville and Indiana Railroad]], also serve the city. With the discontinuance of the stop in Louisville in 2003 for a more northerly route between [[New York City|New York]] and Chicago, the ''[[Kentucky Cardinal]]'' no longer serves the city; it is thus the fifth largest city in the country with no passenger rail service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trainweb.org/moksrail/documents/pop/msa.htm |title=Metropolitan Areas Served by Amtrak |date=November 23, 2006 |access-date=April 21, 2009 |archive-date=June 24, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624205811/http://www.trainweb.org/moksrail/documents/pop/msa.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2016 [[Walk Score]] ranked Louisville 43rd "most walkable" of 141 U.S. cities with a population greater than 200,000.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.walkscore.com/cities-and-neighborhoods/ |title=Most Walkable Cities in the US |year=2016 |publisher=[[Walk Score]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170131231927/https://www.walkscore.com/cities-and-neighborhoods/ |archive-date=January 31, 2017 |url-status=live |access-date=May 6, 2017 }}</ref>

[[File:Louisville water tower.jpg|thumb|upright|Completed in 1860, the [[Louisville Water Tower]] is the oldest water tower in the U.S.]]

Electricity is provided to the Louisville Metro area by [[Louisville Gas & Electric]].
Water is provided by the [[Louisville Water Company]], which provides water to more than 800,000 residents in Louisville as well as parts of [[Oldham County, Kentucky|Oldham]] and [[Bullitt County, Kentucky|Bullitt]] counties. Additionally, they provide wholesale water to the outlying counties of [[Shelby County, Kentucky|Shelby]], [[Spencer County, Kentucky|Spencer]] and [[Nelson County, Kentucky|Nelson]].<ref>Data from [http://www.louisvilleky.gov/LWC Louisville Water] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415204341/http://www.louisvilleky.gov/LWC |date=April 15, 2009 }}</ref>

The [[Ohio River]] provides for most of the city's source of [[drinking water]]. Water is drawn from the river at two points: the [[raw water]] [[pump station]] at Zorn Avenue and River Road, and the B.E. Payne Pump Station northeast of [[Harrods Creek]]. Water is also obtained from a riverbank infiltration well at the Payne Plant. There are also two [[water purification|water treatment plants]] serving the Louisville Metro area: The Crescent Hill Treatment Plant and the B.E. Payne Treatment Plant. In June 2008, the Louisville Water Company received the "Best of the Best" award from the American Water Works Association, citing it as the best-tasting drinking water in the country.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.awwa.org/publications/MainStreamArticle.cfm?itemnumber=36618 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326024952/http://www.awwa.org/publications/MainStreamArticle.cfm?itemnumber=36618 |archive-date=March 26, 2012 |title=Louisville wins best water taste test |date=June 10, 2008 |publisher=American Water Works Association |access-date=March 8, 2010}}</ref>

The primary law enforcement agencies are the [[Louisville Metro Police Department]] (LMPD) and the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office (JCSO). ''911'' [[emergency medical services]] are provided by the government as [[Louisville Metro EMS]].

Fire protection is provided by 16 independent [[fire department]]s working in concert through [[mutual aid (emergency services)|mutual aid]] agreements. The only fire department operated by Metro Government is [[Louisville Fire & Rescue]], the successor to the pre-merger Louisville Division of Fire. The city of [[Shively, Kentucky|Shively]] in western [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]] possesses an independent fire department that uses the same dispatch and radio channels as Louisville Fire and Rescue.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hall |first1=Christopher |title=Shively firefighters strengthen ties with Louisville |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-courier-journal-shively-fire-departm/149716712/ |access-date=June 20, 2024 |work=[[The Courier-Journal]] |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |date=May 28, 2003 |page=D1 |archive-date=September 23, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240923064545/https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-courier-journal-shively-fire-departm/149716712/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
