'''Kaesong'''{{efn|In the 19th century, Kaesong was also spelled ''Kaï-seng''.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=390}}}} ({{IPAc-en|UK|k|eɪ|ˈ|s|ɒ|ŋ}}, {{IPAc-en|US|k|eɪ|ˈ|s|ɔː|ŋ}}; {{IPA|ko|kɛsʌ̹ŋ|lang}}) is a [[Special cities of North Korea|special city]] in the southern part of [[North Korea]] (formerly in [[North Hwanghae Province]]), and the capital of [[Korea]] during the [[Taebong]] kingdom and subsequent [[Goryeo]] dynasty. The city is near the [[Kaesong Industrial Region]] close to the [[Military Demarcation Line|border]] with [[South Korea]] and contains the remains of the [[Manwoldae|Manwoldae palace]]. Called Songdo while it was the ancient capital of Goryeo, the city prospered as a trade centre that produced Korean [[ginseng]]. Kaesong now functions as North Korea's [[light industry]] centre.

During the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]] from 1910 to 1945, the city was known by the [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations|Japanese pronunciation of its name]], "Kaijō".<ref>[http://www.drben.net/Koreas_Report/Sources/Korea_Maps/Historic/1945/Map-Japan-Korea-1945-01.html Historic Map: Geographic overview Japan & Korea 1945 AD – 1B<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Between 1945 and 1950, Kaesong was part of South Korea and under its control. During the [[Korean War]], North Korea captured the city, and the 1953 [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] left the city under North Korean control. Due to the city's proximity to the border with South Korea, Kaesong has hosted cross-border economic exchanges between the two countries as well as the jointly run [[Kaesong Industrial Region]].

As of 2009, the city had a population of 192,578.<ref name="Nkorea2009">{{cite web|url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=POP&f=tableCode:240|title=City population by sex, city and city type|publisher=[[United Nations]]|year=2009|access-date=16 December 2013}}</ref>

==History==
The earliest archaeological signs of habitation in the Kaesong area date from the [[Neolithic]]. Artifacts such as [[Jeulmun pottery period|Jeulmun pottery]], stone ware, and stone axes have been excavated from [[Osongsan]] and [[Kaesong Nasong]], the double-walled fortress of Kaesong. As Kaesong has been occupied by various states throughout centuries, its name has changed. It was in the realm of [[Mahan confederacy]], and was referred to as ''Busogap'' during the rule of [[Goguryeo]]. Before the strength of [[Baekje]] was retreated to the southwest of [[Jungnyeong]], [[Mungyeong Saejae]], and [[Asan Bay]] in 475, the area had been a part of [[Baekje]] for about 100 years.

However, it became a territory of [[Silla]] in 555, the 16th year of [[Jinheung of Silla]]'s reign, and its name was changed to ''Song'ak-gun'' during the period. According to the ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'', when a castle was built in the site in 694, the third year of [[Hyoso of Silla]]'s reign, Kaesong was referred to as "Song'ak (송악; 松嶽)". Therefore, it is assumed that the name Song'ak had been used at least before the time.<ref name="EncyKorea">{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=291958&v=43#P5|script-title=ko:개성시 開城市 (Kaesong)|language=ko|publisher=Nate/ [[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610082842/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=291958&v=43#P5|archive-date=10 June 2011}}</ref>

===Goryeo===
Silla began to decline in the late 9th century, and a period of rival warlords ensued. In 898, Kaesong fell under the hand of [[Gung Ye]], the founder of his short-lived state, [[Taebong]], and then became a part of [[Goryeo]] in 919 by its founder, Wang Geon, who was enthroned as [[Taejo of Goryeo]]. Taejo established the capital in the south of Song'ak, and incorporated Kaesong into Song'ak under the name of "Gaeju". In 919, Kaesong became the national capital. In 960, the 11th year of [[Gwangjong of Goryeo]]'s reign, the city was renamed Gaegyeong, and in 995, the 14th year of [[Seonjong of Goryeo]]'s reign, it was elevated to "Gaesong-bu". The Gaeseong-bu is a combined term of Song'ak-gun, and Gaesong-gun, which is different from the region of the pre-1945 Gaesong-ri, Seo-myeon, Kaepung-gun. In 1010, the first year of [[Hyeonjong of Goryeo]]'s reign, the palace and houses were almost burnt down during the [[second conflict in the Goryeo–Khitan War]], so in 1018, Gaesong-bu was relegated for the "bu" system, and became to govern the three hyeon unites of Jeongju, Deoksu, and Gangeum.<ref name="EncyKorea" />

In the late 12th century, there was instability in both the government and the countryside. A slave named [[Manjeok|Manjŏk]] (or Manjeok) (만적; 萬積) led a group of slaves who gathered outside Kaesong in 1198. The revolt plot was suppressed by [[Ch'oe Ch'ung-hŏn]].<ref>Michael J. Seth. ''A concise history of Korea: from the neolithic period through the nineteenth century.'' pp. 99–102. Rowman & Littlefield, 2006.</ref> When Yi Song-gye overthrew Goryeo in 1392 and established [[Joseon]] as [[Taejo of Joseon]], he moved the Korean capital from Kaesong to Hanyang (modern-day [[Seoul]]) in 1394.<ref name="EncyKorea" />

=== 20th century ===

Kaesong remained a part of [[Gyeonggi Province]] until the [[Korean War]]. When Korea was partitioned at the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] after [[World War II]], Kaesong was on the southern side of the line (within South Korea).

However, the [[battle of Kaesong-Munsan]] was won by the [[Korean People's Army]] (KPA) in the first days of the Korean War. The city was recaptured by UN Forces on 9 October 1950 during the [[UN Offensive, 1950|pursuit of the KPA]] that followed the successful [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon landings]]. UN Forces [[Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River#Aftermath|abandoned]] the city on 16 December 1950 during the withdrawal to the [[Imjin River]] following the Chinese [[People's Volunteer Army]] intervention in the war. Kaesong would remain under Chinese/North Korean control until the end of the war.<ref name="EncyKorea" />

Ceasefire negotiations began in Kaesong<ref name="britannica.com">{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kaesong | title=Kaesŏng &#124; North Korea &#124; Britannica }}</ref> on 10 July 1951, but were moved to [[Panmunjom]], southeast of the city, on 25 October 1951. The [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] signed on 27 July 1953 recognised [[North Korea]]n control over Kaesong making it the only city to change control from South Korea to North Korea as a result of the war. Postwar Kaesong and the part of Kyonggi Province that came to be occupied was organized into "Kaesong Region" (''Kaesŏng Chigu;'' 개성 지구; 開城 地區). In 1957, Kaesong became a "Directly Governed City" (''Kaesŏng Chikhalsi;'' 개성 직할시; 開城 直轄市).

=== 21st century ===

In 2002, [[Kaesong Industrial Region|Kaesŏng Industrial Region]] was formed from part of Kaesong. In 2003, the remaining part of Kaesong (excluding the Industrial Region) became part of [[North Hwanghae Province]]. The city is close to the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]] that divides North and South Korea.

In October 2019, Kaesong became a "Special City".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20200213161400504?input=1195m|script-title=ko:北, 새 '치안총수'에 김정호…"개성시, 특별시로 승격"|title=Bae, sae 'chianchongsu'e gimjeongho…"Gaeseongsi, teugbyeolsilo seung-gyeog"|website=[[Yonhap News Agency]]|date=13 February 2020|access-date=5 April 2020}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{See also|Geography of North Korea}}

Located in the center of Korea, Kaesong is the southernmost city of North Korea. It is bordered by [[Kaepung]], [[Changpung]], [[Panmun-guyok|Panmun]], and [[Kumchon]] counties. [[Kanghwa Island]] of [[Incheon]] Municipality lies just south, beyond a narrow channel. It covers an area of 1,309&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, the urban district is surrounded by [[Songaksan (North Hwanghae)|Songak]] (Songak-san; 송악산; 松嶽山) (489&nbsp;m) and [[Pongmyongsan|Pongmyong]] mountains. The city center surrounds the much smaller Mt. Janam (103&nbsp;m), on which is located the city's [[Kim Il Sung]] statue.

In the northern part of Kaesong, the end of the [[Ahobiryong Mountains|Ahobiryŏng]] range creates the northernmost border of Kaesong City. This range consists of Mts. [[Chonmasan|Chŏnma]] (757 m), Sŏnggŏ, Myoji (764 m), Suryong (716 m), Chesŏk (749 m), Hwajang (558 m), and Ogwan. With the exception of the mountainous northeastern region, however, most areas of Kaesong consist of low hills with heights less than 100 meters [[Above sea level|A.S.L.]]<ref name="Brit Geography">{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=&i=1010430|script-title=ko:개성직할시 자연환경 (Nature of Kaesong)|language=ko|publisher=[[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] / [[Britannica]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610082613/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=&i=1010430|archive-date=10 June 2011}}</ref>

The [[Imjin River]] flows along the northeastern border line of the city and the [[Ryesong River]] (禮成江) (Ryeseong-gang; 례성강) (transliterated in South Korea as Yeseong-gang; 예성강) runs along the western border to the mouth of the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]]. In addition to the two rivers, small and large rivers and streams such as the Samich'ŏn, Wŏlamch'ŏn, Chukbaech'ŏn, Kŭmsŏngch'ŏn, and [[Sach'ŏn river]]s drain into the Han. The river basin located in the southwest of Kaesong has spacious alluvial plains such as P'ungdŏkbŏl, Singwangbŏl, and Samsŏngbŏl.<ref name="Brit Geography" />

The geology consists of the [[Proterozoic]], [[Cenozoic]], and [[Paleozoic]] [[stratum|strata]] and [[Mesozoic]] intrusive [[granite]]. The underground resources include [[gold]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[fluorspar]], [[limestone]], granite, and [[kaolin]]. The soil comprises generally brown forest soil while the areas drained by Yesŏng, Imjin, and Han rivers consist of mostly [[alluvial soil|alluvial]] and [[saline soil]]. The climate is generally warm and moderate, with an average annual temperature of around 10&nbsp;°C. The coldest month is January, with an average temperature of −5.9&nbsp;°C, while the hottest month is August, with an average temperature of 24.7&nbsp;°C. The average annual rainfall ranges from 1,300 to 1,400 millimeters. The duration of frost-free period is 180 days—the longest in North Korea. About 55% of Kaesong is forested (80% of the trees are pines), and 40 species of mammals and 250 birds inhabit the area.<ref name="Brit Geography" />

===Climate===
Kaesong has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Dwa''), with cold, dry winters and hot, humid summers with abundant rainfall.

==Administrative divisions==
Before 2002, what is now Kaesong Directly Governed City was divided into one city (Kaesŏng itself) and one county and two wards: [[Changpung County]],
[[Kaepung-guyok]] and [[Panmun-guyok]]. In 2003, P'anmun-gun and part of Kaesong-si were separated from Kaesŏng Directly Governed City and merged to form [[Kaesong Industrial Region]]. The remaining part of Kaesŏng joined [[North Hwanghae Province]] in 2002. Kaesong is currently divided into 24 administrative districts known as [[Administrative divisions of North Korea#Third-level divisions|Dong]], as well as three villages ("ri").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nk.joins.com/map/i032.htm|script-title=ko:개성시(開城市) – KAESONGSI|work=[[JoongAng Ilbo]]|language=ko}}</ref> After Kaesong promoted 
to Special City, Changpung County, Kaepung-guyok and Panmun-guyok return to Kaesong.

Kaesong is home to the [[World Heritage Site]] [[Historic Monuments and Sites in Kaesong]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Historic Monuments and Sites in Kaesong |publisher=UNESCO |access-date=16 February 2020 |url= http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1278/ }}</ref> [[Koryo Songgyungwan University]] (Light Industry), Communist University and Art College are located in Kaesong. The [[Koryo Museum]], housed in the city's old [[Songgyungwan|Confucian academy]], contains many priceless Goryeo arts and cultural relics (although many are copies, with the originals held in the vaults of the [[Korean Central History Museum]] in [[Pyongyang]]).

As the former capital of Goryeo, the tombs of almost all of the Goryeo kings are located in the area, though most are not accessible; the heavily reconstructed [[Tomb of King Wanggon]], belonging to the dynasty's founder, [[Taejo of Goryeo]], is located to the west of the city in Kaepung-gun. Other notable tombs include those of kings [[Hyejong of Goryeo]] (the [[Sollung Royal Tomb]]), [[Gyeongjong of Goryeo]] ([[Yongrung Royal Tomb]]), [[Seongjong of Goryeo]] ([[Kangrung Royal Tomb]]), [[Hyeonjong of Goryeo]] ([[Sollung Royal Tomb]]), [[Munjong of Goryeo]] ([[Kyongrung Royal Tomb]]), and [[Gongmin of Goryeo]] ([[Tomb of King Kongmin]]). Kaesong also contains North Korea's only two royal tombs dating to the [[Joseon]]: the [[Hurung Royal Tomb]], belonging to the dynasty's second king, [[Jeongjong of Joseon]], and the [[Cherung Royal Tomb]], containing the remains of Queen Sinui, wife of the dynasty's founder, [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Songgye]] (Taejo of Joseon). The two final tombs, despite belonging to members of the Joseon royal family, were excluded from the World Heritage Site [[Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty]] because of their location in North Korea.

==Education==
[[Sungkyunkwan]], one kilometer north of Seonjukgyo bridge is a representative traditional educational institution in Kaesong. It was founded in the neighborhood of [[Gukja-dong]] with the name [[Gukjagam]] (국자감; 國子監) in 992 during the reign of [[Seongjong of Goryeo|King Seongjong]] of [[Goryeo]], which ignited [[Korean Confucianism]]. Its name was changed to [[Gukhak]] (국학; 國學) in the reign of [[Chungnyeol of Goryeo]] and was referred to as ''Seonggyungwan''. In 1367, the 16th year of [[Gongmin of Goryeo]]'s reign, the structure was revamped and [[Yi Saek]], and [[Chŏng Mong-ju]], Confucian scholars of the time taught there as professors. In 1592, the 25th year of [[Seonjo of Joseon]]'s reign, [[Kim Yuk]] reconstructed the institution which was burned down by the Japanese during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)]].<ref name="EncyKorea" />

The first modern school that appeared in Kaesong was [[Hanyeong Seowon]] (한영서원; 韓英書院), or Anglo-Korean School established by [[Yun Chi-ho]] in 1906, with the help of American missionaries Mr. Wasson, and Mr. Candler. It obtained authorization as Songdo High School from [[Governor-General of Korea]] in 1917, and expanded to the Songdo School Foundation in 1950 with the accreditation for the establishment of Songdo Middle School and Songdo College of Pharmacy, the latter of which produced 40 graduates. However, when the Korean War occurred, the foundation was moved to Incheon, and reconstructed Songdo Middle and High Schools in 1953 which still exist to the present.<ref name="EncyKorea" />

By 1950, there were two public high schools: Kaeseong High School (개성중학교; 開城中學校) and Kaeseong Girls' High School (개성고등여학교; 開城高等女學校) and three private high schools: Songdo High School (송도중학교; 松都中學校), Jeonghwa Girls' School (정화여학교;貞和女學校) and Hosudon Girls' School (호수돈여학교; 好壽敦女學校). Like Songdo High School, Jeonghwa and Hosudon Girls' Schools, with the teachers and most students, evacuated south during the [[Korean War]] and their campuses now are located in [[Seoul]] and [[Daejeon]] respectively.

There were also eight public elementary schools (국민학교) in Kaeseong by 1950, they were the Manwol (만월; 滿月), Donghyun (동현; 銅峴), Seonjuk (선죽; 善竹), Koryo (고려; 高麗), Songdo (송도; 松都), Junggyeong (중경; 中京), Namsan (남산; 南山) and Deokam (덕암; 德岩) elementary schools.

As of 2002, Kaesong had 80 each public elementary schools which scattered in each unit of ''ri'' (village), 60 middle-high schools, 3 colleges and 3 universities such as Songdo University of Politics, Kaesong University of Education, and Kaesong Communist University.<ref name="Brit Education">[http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=&i=1010433 개성직할시 교육과 문화 (Education and Culture of Kaesong)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610082918/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=&i=1010433 |date=10 June 2011 }} (in Korean) Nate / Britannica</ref>
