'''Stara Zagora''' ({{langx|bg|Стара Загора}}, {{IPA|bg|ˈstarɐ zɐˈɡɔrɐ|pron}}) is a city in [[Bulgaria]], and the administrative capital of [[Stara Zagora Province]]. It is located in the [[Upper Thracian Plain]], near the cities of [[Kazanlak]], [[Plovdiv]], and [[Sliven]]. Its population is 121,582 making it the sixth largest city of Bulgaria, located North East of Plovdiv. 

The city has had different names previously, including ''Beroe, Borui, Irenepolis, Eski Zagra, Augusta Traiana,'' etc. The earliest traces of civilisation date back to the 7th millennium BC. Some scholars believe that the ancient Thracian city of Beroe was located on the present site of Stara Zagora. In 1968, Neolithic dwellings from the mid-6th millennium BC were discovered in the town, which are the best preserved and richest collection in Europe of its kind and have been turned into a museum.

A high density of Neolithic and Chalcolithic settlements has been identified by researchers and a ritual structure nearly 8,000 years old has also been discovered. The first copper factory in Europe and a large ore mining centre were discovered, both over 7,000 years old. The original settlement dates from the 5th-4th century B.C under the name Beroe or Beroia, founded by [[Philip II of Macedon]]. It was renamed to Ulpia Augusta Traiana during [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule and became the second most important city, after [[Philippopolis (Thrace)|Philippopolis]]. During [[Marcus Aurelius]]' rule, many buildings have been built, art and music developed and there were statues and inscriptions of [[Orpheus]].

The [[Goths]] defeated the Romans in the [[Battle of Beroe]] in 250 AD. During the [[Gothic War (376–382)|Gothic War]] between 376 and 382, the Roman general, [[Frigeridus (dux)|Frigeridus]] promptly withdrew from Beroe to [[Illyria]]. At the end of the 6th century, Beroe was destroyed, but rebuilt under the name Veroia.

During the Middle Ages, [[Zagore (region)|Zagore]] is mentioned for the first time by Byzantine historians. [[Irene of Athens]] visited the town, rebuilding it and renaming it to Irenepolis, in honour of her. By the end of the 10th century, the city was in Bulgarian hands and acquired a fully Bulgarian character. Bulgarians called the town Borui (a modified form of the Thracian Beroe).

In 1371, the city passed to Ottoman Empire, but its earliest mention was in an Ottoman document from 1430. Plagues rampaged in the 18th-19th century, as well as famine and drought, livestock pestilence, and hailstorms destroyed all crops. During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878]], the town had devastating moments, which included a [[Stara Zagora massacre|massacre]] ofr the local Bulgarians, in which thousands of people lost their lives, young women and girls being sold in the slave market of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

In modern times, the city is relieved, as a growing city. The economy is developing like major cities in Bulgaria, with one of the highest wages in the country, high GDP in comparison with many Bulgarian cities, low unemployment of about 4%. The city is also located near the largest energy industrial complex, [[Maritsa Iztok Complex]], where many of the people from Stara Zagora are employed.

== Name ==
The name comes from the Slavic root ''star'' ("old") and the name of the medieval region of [[Zagore (region)|Zagore]] ("beyond the [[Balkan Mountains|Balkan mountains]]" in Slavic)<ref name=starazagora>{{cite web |url=http://www.vereya.com/objects.php?cid=1001&lang=bg |title=Стара Загора |publisher=Верея Тур |language=bg |access-date=2008-09-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117143114/http://www.vereya.com/objects.php?lang=bg&cid=1001 |archive-date=2007-01-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The original name was Beroe, which was changed to Ulpia Augusta Traiana by the Romans. From the 6th century the city was called Vereja and, from 784, Irenopolis ([[Medieval Greek|Greek]]: Ειρηνούπολις) in honour of the Byzantine empress Irene of Athens. In the Middle Ages it was called Boruj by the Bulgarians and later, Železnik. The Turks called it Eski Hisar (old fort) and Eski Zagra, from which its current name derives, assigned in 1871.

[[Beroe Hill]] on [[Livingston Island]], [[West Antarctica]] is named after this city, in its previous incarnation as Beroe.

The original Thracian settlement dates from the 5-4th century BC when it was called Beroe or Beroia.

The city was founded by [[Philip II of Macedon]] in 342 BC.<ref>Women and slaves in Greco-Roman culture: differential equations by Sandra Rae Joshel, [[Sheila Murnaghan]],1998,page 214,"Philip II founded cities at Beroe, Kabyle, and Philippopolis in 342/1, and Aegean-style urban life began to penetrate Thrace".</ref><ref>Late Roman villas in the Danube-Balkan region by Lynda Mulvin,2002,page 19,"Other roads went through Beroe (founded by Philip II of Macedon) "</ref><ref>Philip of Macedon by Louïza D.

=== Antiquity ===
[[File:The roman amphithe galleryfull.jpg|right|thumb|Auditorium of the Antique Forum|276x276px]]

Under the [[Roman Empire]], the city was renamed ''Ulpia Augusta Traiana'' in honour of emperor [[Trajan]].
The city grew to its largest extent under [[Marcus Aurelius]] (161-180) and became the second most important city in the Roman province of [[Thracia|Thrace]] after [[Philippopolis (Thracia)|Philippopolis]] (Trimontium). Its status and importance is evidenced by the visits of several emperors including [[Septimius Severus]] (193-211), [[Caracalla]] (211-217), and [[Diocletian]] (294-305). The city became the second largest economic, administrative and cultural centre in the province. The famous Roman historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] wrote: "The great cities of Philippopolis and Augusta Traiana, which in antiquity were called Eumolpiada and Beroea, adorn the province of Thrace". The city has an independent municipal government, a city council and a people's assembly and enjoys a special status.<ref>Известия на Историческото Дружество въ София, книга XI-XII, Към Историята на Августа Траяна, Д.П.Димитров, Придворна Печатница-София, 1932</ref> By special order, it was in this city that the veterans of the wars fought by the [[Roman Empire]] settled. During the reign of Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] (161-180), straight streets, dozens of residential and public buildings, city walls enclosing an area of about 50 hectares and reinforced with about 40 towers, of which 11 have been excavated, water supply, sewerage, theatre building, temples, markets, [[Odeon (building)|odeon]], [[thermae]], forum were built in the city. A theatron with marble seats was also built, from which the spectacular gladiatorial battles, processions, celebrations, or assemblies where the important affairs of the city were decided, were observed. A gymnasium existed in the city, and sporting events were held in the [[stadium]]. The arts and [[music]]s developed in the city, as evidenced by the examples of bronze and stone sculpture, jewellery, pottery, glass objects, statues and inscriptions for [[Orpheus]] that have been found.

The [[Battle of Beroe]] was fought near the city in 250 resulting in a Gothic Victory.<ref>The History of Zonaras: From Alexander Severus to the Death of Theodosius, Thomas Banchich, Eugene Lane, {{ISBN|1134424736}}, 9781134424733 p 94</ref> It was probably after this event that the city walls were doubled like other cities in the region (e.g. [[Diocletianopolis (Thrace)|Diocletianopolis]], [[Serdica]]).

In the 2nd-3rd century the city had its own coin mint showing its importance.

In 377, in the [[Gothic War (376–382)|Gothic War (376-382)]], the Goths marched on Beroe to attack the Roman general Frigiderus but his scouts detected the invaders and he promptly withdrew to Illyria.<ref>Coombs-Hoar, Adrian (2015). Eagles in the Dust: The Roman Defeat at Adrianopolis AD 378. Pen and Sword. p 62-3</ref> The city was destroyed but rebuilt by [[Justinian]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.livius.org/articles/place/augusta-traiana-stara-zagora/|title = Augusta Traiana (Stara Zagora) - Livius}}</ref>
During the period of Late Antiquity (4th-6th centuries) the town was again named Beroe. The times are connected with the relocation of the capital of the empire from Rome to Constantinople, the accelerated Christianization of the local population, the Gothic invasions at the end of the 4th century and the devastating raids of the Huns in the middle of the 5th century.

In late antiquity, a mass Christianization of the local population began in Beroe, especially after the Medo-Latin Edict. The town was one of the most active centres of early Christianity. The first to introduce Christianity here was the apostle Carpus, one of the 70 apostles of [[Jesus Christ]] and a disciple of the apostle Paul. Beroe became the seat of a bishopric, which grew into an archbishopric. Bishop Demophilus of Beroe takes part in the Serdika Church Council. In 355, the Roman [[Pope Liberius]] was exiled to Beroe, and Demophilus went to Constantinople, where he reached the highest rank - Patriarch of the Byzantine Empire.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=VIdsCQAAQBAJ "Prison, Punishment and Penance in Late Antiquity, 2013, Julia Hillner]</ref><ref>[http://trakia-tours.com/wp/fortresses/римски-градове-в-българия/берое-августа-траяна-beroe-augusta-traiana/беройски-епископ-става-патриарх-на-из/, „Беройски епископ става патриарх на Източната империя“]</ref>

In the 6th century, the city is mentioned as Beroe in the Gothic calendar under the date 19 November, associated with the famous 40 female martyrs. At the end of the century, the town was again destroyed, but then rebuilt and took the name Vereia.

=== Middle Ages ===
For the first time the [[Zagore (region)|Zagore]] area is mentioned in the accounts of George Amartole, repeated by [[Symeon Logothete]], [[George Kedrenos]] and [[Symeon the Metaphrast]], where the help that Tervel's Bulgarian army gave to Emperor Justinian II in his restoration to the Constantinople throne is described. On this occasion, in 705, a peace treaty was signed between the Byzantine Empire and Bulgaria, according to which the Zagore region was ceded to Bulgaria. Three years later, according to other sources, [[Justinian II]] tried to regain the area, but was defeated near Anchialos. According to the later accounts of [[Theophanes the Confessor]], in 716 a new treaty was concluded between the new emperor [[Theodosius III]] and [[Tervel of Bulgaria|Tervel]], according to which, in addition to the area of Zagore finally ceded to the Bulgarians, another part of Thrace was ceded to the west of Zagore, as far as the "Mileon in Thrace". In 717. In 717 Tervel gave new aid to the empire with a large army and defeated the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] that had [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|besieged Constantinople]]. After that, Beroe repeatedly passed now to Byzantium, now to Bulgaria.
In 784 Beroe was in the possession of the Byzantine Empire and the empress [[Irene of Athens|Irene]] visited the town together with her son [[Constantine VI]] and a large retinue of courtiers. The empress rebuilt the town and called it Irenopolis - the city of Irena. The chronicler Theophanes the Confessor describes the visit of the empress to Beroe: "In that year, in the month of January, ind. seven, the said Stavracius returned from the land of the warehouses and on the hippodrome celebrated his victory with triumph. And in the month of May, of the same seventh Ind. the Empress Irene with her son and many troops went out into Thrace, bringing with her musical instruments, and came to Beroe. She ordered that this city should be built up, and renamed it Irenopolis."

John's Byzantine army, and many of the captives, were settled as [[foederati]] within the Byzantine frontier.

In 812 Irenopolis was Bulgarian again and was called Beroe after the victorious war of Krum in 812. Historical sources show that after the peace treaty of 817, the Bulgarian state took extensive measures to defend and fortify the area south of the [[Balkan Mountains]] from Beroe to the sea in order to annex it permanently to Bulgaria. By 850 - 860 Beroe was Bulgarian and the population was already majority Bulgarian by this time. For a few years the Byzantines took [[Zagore (region)|Zagore]], but during the conversion of Knyaz [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Boris I]] in 864, the Zagora area and the town of Beroe were returned to Bulgaria. The chronicles about the return of the district also state its borders - from Sider (Zhelezni vrata, today Zmeyovski Pass) to Debelt. Within the borders of Bulgaria, the town was the centre of a [[comitatus]]<ref>[33, с. 386]. Гюзелев, В. Цит. съч., с. 386</ref> and retained its role as one of the largest administrative, economic and religious centres. The emperors lived here for a long time and used Boruyi as a second capital. For two centuries it was the residence of the Byzantine emperors of the [[Komnenos]] family. From here they organized campaigns against the northern invaders - the [[Pechenegs]] and [[Cumans]].

The stone reliefs from Stara Zagora from the 8th - 9th centuries are of high cultural and historical value, they are recognized as a masterpiece of fine art and are one of the most interesting archaeological finds in Europe.<ref>История на българското изобразително изкуство.

By the end of the 10th century, the city was in Bulgarian hands and acquired a fully Bulgarian character. Bulgarians called the town Borui (a modified form of the Thracian Beroe).

The traveller [[Al-Idrisi]], who visited the town, reported that in the 11th-12th centuries the road from the town of Veroi to the now unidentified town of Patsimiscus passed through successive fields of crops, continuous cultivated fields, large villages, many vineyards, orchards, past numerous herds of sheep, cattle and small livestock.<ref>Страшимир Н. Лишев, Географията на Мохамед Ал-Идриси като исторически извор за българските градове през XII в.// Античная древность и средние века, вь1п. 10. 1973</ref> During the [[Crusades]], when the troops of [[Frederick I Barbarossa]] were passing through the Balkans, the Austrian priest Ansbert, who had access to the imperial chancellery, wrote of the town of Vereia as a "large, rich city" which the crusaders captured, sacked, and burned.

In 1208 the Bulgarians defeated the [[Latin Empire]] in the [[battle of Boruy]], also fought nearby.

===Ottoman rule===

The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] conquered Stara Zagora in 1371. The earliest Ottoman document mentioning the town is from 1430.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/44431293/Иван_Войников_НЕИЗЯСНЕНИ_МОМЕНТИ_ОТ_МИНАЛОТО_НА_ГРАД_СТАРА_ЗАГОРА Иван Войников. Неизяснени моменти от миналото на град Стара Загора]</ref> The Ottomans, knowing about the old history of the town as the centre of the Zagore region, welded a huge amount of cultural and historical heritage in the town and in the early years named it with various similar names - Zagr and Atik (Ancient Zagra), Zagra and Atik Hisar (Ancient City of Zagra), Zagra, Zagra and Eski Hisar, Zagral Eskisi (Old Zagra), Eski Zagora (Ancient Zagora), Zagrasi Atik, Zagralie Eskisi, Eskisi Zagora (Old Zagora). Later, however, in the seventeenth century, a single form - Eski Zagra. According to [[Evliya Celebi]], in the 17th century there were 3000 houses in Stara Zagora, about 760 roads and 14 neighborhoods. At that time there were 5 mosques. There was also 1 madrasah, 42 schools, 5 hamams (named Alaja, Pasha, Yeni, Chifte and Kyuchuk hamams), 1 besisten and 855 dukhans. It does not mention the presence of a Bulgarian population in the city, although there is evidence of tombstones with Bulgarian names. Further evidence of this is a surviving Greek inscription in the church of St. Demetrius, which indicates the presence of a church on this site long before 1743, serving the Christian population.

In 1738 the population of Stara Zagora was predominantly Turkish.<ref name=":03222">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/894636829|title=България и нейният народ под османска власт: през погледа на англосаксонските пътешественици (1586 – 1878)|last=Лео|first=Мишел|date=2013|publisher=ТАНГРА ТанНакРа|others=Глухарова, Мариета|year=2013|isbn=9789543781065|location=София|pages=129; 133 – 134|oclc=894636829}}</ref> In 1788, a plague epidemic raged, and in 1792, famine and drought, livestock pestilence, and hailstorms destroyed all crops. During this time, military contingents passed through the settlements for punitive purposes, 'stripping the naked man of his shirt and the barefoot man of his shoes'. The worst years, however, were 1813, 1814 and 1815: these were the plague years known as the 'Great Plague' or 'Great Carron'. The next plague epidemic came in 1837 and was called 'The Little Plague'.
A grade school was built in 1840 and the city's name was changed to ''Zheleznik'' ({{lang|bg|Железник}}; a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] translation of ''Beroe'') in 1854 instead of the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] {{lang|tr|Eskizağra}} (Also called Zağra-i Atik), but was renamed once again to ''Stara Zagora'' in 1870. It was an administrative centre in [[Edirne Vilayet]] before 1878 as "Zağra-i Atik".<ref>http://acikarsiv.ankara.edu.tr/fulltext/3066.pdf {{Dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>

==== Stara Zagora Uprising ====

{{Main|Stara Zagora Uprising}}

The [[Herzegovina uprising (1875–1877)|Herzegovina uprising]] in 1875 prompted Bulgarian revolutionaries to become active. On 12 August 1875, on the initiative of [[Hristo Botev]] and [[Stefan Stambolov]], an extraordinary national assembly was held in [[Bucharest]], which decided to declare an immediate armed uprising in Bulgaria. Stara Zagora was chosen as the centre of the uprising. Kolyo Ganchev was elected the leader of the uprising in the town. The uprising was dispersed by the Ottomans, but served as an impetus for the liberation through the [[April Uprising of 1876|April Uprising]] in 1876.

=== Battle and Stara Zagora massacre ===

{{Main|Stara Zagora massacre}}

On 31 July 1877, the first major battle of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] took place near Stara Zagora. The 48,000-strong Turkish army advanced on the town, which was defended only by a small Russian detachment and a unit of Bulgarian volunteers. After a six-hour fight for Stara Zagora, the Russian soldiers and Bulgarian volunteers surrendered to the pressure of the larger enemy army. The town then experienced its greatest tragedy when the Turkish army carried out a massacre against the unarmed civilians. The city was burned down and razed to the ground during three ensuing days of carnage. 14,500 Bulgarians from the town and villages south of the town lost their lives. Another 10,000 young women and girls were sold in the [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|slave markets of the Ottoman Empire]]. All Christian churches were attacked with artillery and burned. The only public building surviving the fire was the mosque, Eski Dzhamiya, which still stands today. Several monuments in modern Stara Zagora commemorate these events.

=== Eastern Rumelia ===
After the [[Liberation of Bulgaria]] from Ottoman rule in 1878, Stara Zagora became part of autonomous [[Eastern Rumelia]] as a department centre before the two Bulgarian states finally merged in 1886 as a result of the [[Unification of Bulgaria]]. The reconstruction of Stara Zagora began immediately after the Liberation. For this purpose, in 1878, the famous architect from [[Austria-Hungary]], Lubor Bayer, arrived in Stara Zagora and designed the modern rectangular checkerboard layout characteristic of today's Stara Zagora. On October 5, 1879, the governor general of Eastern Rumelia [[Alexander Bogoridi]] laid the symbolic first stone for the reconstruction of the town. The only other town in Bulgaria with such a spatial plan was Nova Zagora, which was also burnt by the Turks.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-10-04 |title=Стара Загора - "Градът на правите улици" |url=https://banker.bg/%d0%be%d0%b1%d1%89%d0%b5%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%be-%d0%b8-%d0%bf%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%b8%d1%82%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%b0/read/stara-zagora-gradut-na-pravite-ulici/ |access-date=2023-01-18 |language=bg-BG}}</ref>

=== Flora and fauna ===
The territory of Stara Zagora municipality falls within the Middle Bulgarian biogeographical region - the Upper Thracian Lowland sub-region, characterized by a predominantly flat nature, intensive agriculture and significant urbanization. This predetermines a largely poor in composition and abundance biodiversity. Characteristic forest communities are xerothermic forests and the composition is diverse.

The only scientifically known locality of a plant species protected by the Biodiversity Act is that in the Karasivria locality, north of the town. It is located in the north of Stara Zagora, in the area of [[Spiraea]] hypercifolia. The species is also included in the Red Book of [[Bulgaria]].

The fauna in the area is composed of European, Euro-Siberian and Holopalearctic species. Along with these, many warm Mediterranean, transitional Mediterranean, pre-Asian and steppe species are common. The extent of occurrence of rare species and endemism is most pronounced in invertebrates.

Stara Zagora was possibly the biggest city in today's Bulgarian territory before liberation from Ottoman rule. But the city was burned and destroyed by Turkish army during the Liberation war in 1877–1878, with some 30,000 citizens from Stara Zagora and nearby villages perishing in the [[Stara Zagora massacre]]. During the first decade after the [[liberation of Bulgaria]], in the 1880s the population of Stara Zagora decreased and numbered about 16,000.<ref name="BAN"/> Since then it started growing decade by decade, mostly because of the migrants from the rural areas and the surrounding smaller towns, reaching its peak in the period 1989-1991 exceeding 160,000.<ref name="pop1992">{{in lang|bg}}[http://www.grao.bg/tnv/tvzr2014.txt]</ref> After this time, the population has started decreasing mostly because of the migration to the capital city of Sofia or abroad.{{historical populations|1887|16039|1910|22003|1934|29825|1946|37220|1956|55094|1965|88621|1975|122277|1985|150803|1992|150518|2001|143420|2011|138272|2021|125732|2022|124599|align=right|cols=1|source=Censuses<ref name="BAN">{{cite web |url=http://www.geography.iit.bas.bg/2009/1-09/13-17.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-02-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706142758/http://www.geography.iit.bas.bg/2009/1-09/13-17.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-06 }}</ref>{{cite web|title=National statistical institute|url=https://www.nsi.bg/bg/content/21558/bg008c-%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0|date=2024-10-31}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Cities of Bulgaria|url=http://pop-stat.mashke.org/bulgaria-cities.htm|date=2024-04-03}}</ref>}}<timeline>
