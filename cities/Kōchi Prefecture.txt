{{nihongo|'''Kōchi Prefecture'''|高知県|Kōchi-ken|{{IPA|ja|koːtɕi ꜜkeɴ|pron}}; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|tʃ|i}}}} is a [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] of Japan located on the island of [[Shikoku]].<ref>Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Kōchi prefecture" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 538|page=538}}.</ref> Kōchi Prefecture has a population of 669,516 (1 April 2023) and has a geographic area of 7,103 [[Square kilometre|km<sup>2</sup>]] (2,742 [[sq mi]]). Kōchi Prefecture borders [[Ehime Prefecture]] to the northwest and [[Tokushima Prefecture]] to the northeast.

[[Kōchi, Kōchi|Kōchi]] is the capital and largest city of Kōchi Prefecture, with other major cities including [[Nankoku, Kōchi|Nankoku]], [[Shimanto, Kōchi (city)|Shimanto]], and [[Kōnan, Kōchi|Kōnan]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Kōchi" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 538|page=538}}.</ref> Kōchi Prefecture is located on Japan's [[Pacific]] coast surrounding a large [[bay]] in the south of Shikoku, with the southernmost point of the island located at [[Cape Ashizuri]] in [[Tosashimizu]]. Kōchi Prefecture is home to [[Kōchi Castle]], considered the most intact [[Japanese castle]], and the [[Shimanto River]], one of the few [[Dam|undammed]] rivers in Japan.

== History ==
{{See also|List of historic sites of Japan (Kōchi)}}

=== Antiquity ===

==== Before the Ritsuryō System ====
In the [[Kujiki]], first recorded governments in Kōchi Prefecture were Hata (in the west) and Tosa (in the center). Hata was established first, so it is thought that it had more influence and contact with the [[Yamato Kingship|Yamato]] court. Written records from this time period are sparse, however it is believed that the first governors of Hata and Tosa were from the [[Kamo clan]] based in modern Osaka.

==== After the Ritsuryō System ====
In the [[Nihon Shoki]], the first report from an [[Kokushi (official)|official]] in the Kōchi region described the damages caused by the [[684 Hakuhō earthquake]]. From this report, it can be inferred that by 684 at the latest, the [[Tosa Province]] (a predecessor to modern-day Kōchi Prefecture) had been established. The first report from a named official was written by Hiketa no Mushiro in 743.

Up until the [[Genpei War]], 106 governors were appointed to govern the Tosa Province. Eventually, like many other provinces Tosa also was appointed absentee governors, given additional rights, and began amassing wealth. Due to being located far from the capital, many prisoners were exiled to the Tosa Province.

=== Middle Ages ===

==== Kamakura Period ====
The [[Kamakura shogunate|Kamakura Shogunate]] was established at the end of the 12th century. Since Tosa Province was allied to the winning Minamoto Clan in the Genpei War, it quickly fell under the influence of the shogunate. Kajiwara Tomokage was appointed as the first military governor of the Tosa Province. Eventually, the [[Hōjō clan| Hōjō]] Clan began serving as the military governor for the province.

==== Muromachi Period ====
After the fall of the Kamakura Shoguante, [[Ashikaga Takauji]] was defeated in battle and forced to retreat to Kyushu. Shikoku Island later fell under the control of the [[Hosokawa clan|Hosokawa Clan]]. 

Kōchi Prefecture was historically known as [[Tosa Province]] and was controlled by the [[Chōsokabe clan]] in the [[Sengoku period]] and the [[Yamauchi clan]] during the [[Edo period]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 780|page=780}}.</ref>

Kōchi city is also the birthplace of noted revolutionary [[Sakamoto Ryōma]], who became one of the main instigators of the [[Meiji Restoration]].

== Geography ==
{{see also|List of cities in Kōchi Prefecture by population}}
Kōchi Prefecture comprises the southwestern part of the island of [[Shikoku]], facing the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It is bordered by [[Ehime]] to the north-west and [[Tokushima]] to the north-east. It is the largest but least populous of Shikoku's four prefectures. Most of the province is mountainous, and in only a few areas such as around Kōchi and [[Nakamura, Kōchi|Nakamura]] is there a coastal plain. Kōchi is famous for its many rivers. [[Inamura-yama]] in Tosa-cho is the highest peak in Kōchi prefecture with an [[altitude]] of 1,506 meters [[above sea level]].

Kōchi Prefecture has the highest percentage of land covered in mountains out of all Japanese prefectures at 89% with the national average being 66%. The highest peak in Kōchi Prefecture is [[Mt. Miune]] at 1,894 meters (the highest peak in Kōchi Prefecture is Tebakoyama at 1,806 meters). Due to its location in the Shimanto Group geological area, Kōchi Prefecture has many sedimentary rocks and is prone to landslides. Kōchi Prefecture has many rivers such as the [[Shimanto River]] in the western part of the prefecture, [[Niyodo River]] flowing from [[Mount Ishizuchi]] into the [[Tosa Bay]], and [[Yoshino River]] flowing into [[Tokushima Prefecture]].

Historically, Kōchi Prefecture has not suffered from a lack of water, however [[River engineering|river management]] has been a consistent issue. In the early [[Edo period|Edo Period]], samurai Nonaka Kenzan oversaw large scale improvements to the [[Tosa Domain|Tosa Domain's]] major rivers. Modern Kōchi Prefecture is known for its river management and minimal water damage despite receiving a large amount of rainfall.

The [[Kuroshio Current]] flows by Kōchi Prefecture's coast. The climate of Kōchi Prefecture is heavily influenced by the Kuroshio Current. Even during the winter the water is still warm, and causes frequent [[Typhoon|typhoons]]. Kōchi Prefecture experiences the 2nd most typhoons out of all the Japanese prefectures after [[Kagoshima Prefecture]]. [[1934 Muroto typhoon|The 1934 Muroto Typhoon]] was especially notorious, with the lowest central pressure of any recorded typhoon in Japan at 911.6 hPa when it made landfall on the Muroto Cape. The Ashizuri and Muroto capes are known for their strong winds.

As of April 1, 2012, 7% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as [[List of national parks of Japan#History|Natural Parks]], namely the [[Ashizuri-Uwakai National Park]]; [[Ishizuchi Quasi-National Park|Ishizuchi]], [[Muroto-Anan Kaigan Quasi-National Park|Muroto-Anan Kaigan]], and [[Tsurugisan Quasi-National Park|Tsurugisan]] Quasi-National Parks; and eighteen Prefectural Natural Parks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/nps/park/doc/files/np_6.pdf |title=General overview of area figures for Natural Parks by prefecture |publisher=[[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] |access-date=19 August 2012}}</ref>
