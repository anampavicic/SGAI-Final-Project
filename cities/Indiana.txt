Various [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] inhabited what would become Indiana for thousands of years, some of whom the U.S. government expelled between 1800 and 1836.

==Etymology==
Indiana's name means "Land of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]]", or simply "Indian Land".{{efn|An earlier use of the name dates to the 1760s, when it referenced a tract of land under control of the Commonwealth of Virginia, but the area's name was discarded when it became a part of that state. See {{cite journal |last=Hodgin |first=Cyrus |year=1903 |title=The Naming of Indiana |journal=Papers of the Wayne County, Indiana, Historical Society |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=3–11 |format=PDF transcription |url=http://www.in.gov/history/2805.htm |access-date=January 23, 2014}}}} It also stems from Indiana's territorial history. On May 7, 1800, the [[United States Congress]] passed legislation to divide the [[Northwest Territory]] into two areas and named the western section the [[Indiana Territory]]. In 1816, when Congress passed an Enabling Act to begin the process of establishing statehood for Indiana, a part of this territorial land became the geographic area for the new state.{{efn|A portion of the Northwest Territory's eastern section became the state of [[Ohio]] in 1803. The [[Michigan Territory]] was established in 1805 from part of the Indiana Territory's northern lands and four years later, in 1809, the Illinois counties were separated from the Indiana Territory to create the [[Illinois Territory]].

Formal use of the word ''Indiana'' dates from 1768, when a [[Philadelphia]]-based trading company gave its land claim in present-day [[West Virginia]] the name "Indiana" in honor of its previous owners, the [[Iroquois]]. Later, ownership of the claim was transferred to the [[Indiana Land Company]], the first recorded use of the word ''Indiana''. But the [[Virginia]] colony argued that it was the rightful owner of the land because it fell within its geographic boundaries. The [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] denied the land company's right to the claim in 1798.<ref name="IHBNI">Cyrus Hodgin, {{cite journal|url=http://www.in.gov/history/2805.htm |title=The Naming of Indiana

===Indigenous inhabitants===

[[File:Angel mound with turret HRoe 2008.jpg|thumb|left| [[Angel Mounds State Historic Site]] was one of the northernmost [[Mississippian culture]] settlements, occupied from 1100 to 1450.]]

The first inhabitants in what is now Indiana were the [[Paleo-Indians]], who arrived about 8000 BC after the melting of the glaciers at the end of the [[Last Glacial Period|Ice Age]]. Divided into small groups, the Paleo-Indians were [[nomad]]s who hunted large [[Game (food)|game]] such as [[mastodons]]. They created stone tools made out of [[chert]] by chipping, [[knapping]] and [[Lithic reduction|flaking]].<ref name="HIS">{{cite web| title =Prehistoric Indians of Indiana| publisher =State of Indiana| url =http://in.gov/dnr/historic/files/prehisindians.pdf| access-date =July 5, 2009| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130117084154/http://in.gov/dnr/historic/files/prehisindians.pdf| archive-date =January 17, 2013| url-status =dead}}</ref>

The [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]], which began between 5000 and 4000 BC, covered the next phase of indigenous culture. The people developed new tools as well as techniques to cook food, an important step in civilization. These new tools included different types of spear points and knives, with various forms of [[Nock (arrow)|notches]]. They made ground-stone tools such as stone axes, woodworking tools and grinding stones. During the latter part of the period, they built earthwork [[mound]]s and [[midden]]s, which showed settlements were becoming more permanent. The Archaic period ended at about 1500 BC, although some Archaic people lived until 700 BC.<ref name="HIS"/>

The [[Woodland period]] began around 1500 BC when new cultural attributes appeared. The people created ceramics and pottery and extended their cultivation of plants. An early Woodland period group named the [[Adena culture|Adena people]] had elegant burial rituals, featuring log tombs beneath earth mounds. In the middle of the Woodland period, the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell people]] began to develop long-range trade of [[Good (economics)|goods]]. Nearing the end of the stage, the people developed highly productive cultivation and adaptation of agriculture, growing such crops as [[Maize|corn]] and [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. The Woodland period ended around 1000 AD.<ref name="HIS"/>

The [[Mississippian culture]] emerged, lasting from 1000 AD until the 15th century, shortly before the arrival of Europeans. During this stage, the people created large urban settlements designed according to their [[cosmology]], with large mounds and plazas defining ceremonial and public spaces. The concentrated settlements depended on the agricultural surpluses. One such complex was the [[Angel Mounds]]. They had large public areas such as plazas and platform mounds, where leaders lived or conducted rituals. Mississippian civilization collapsed in Indiana during the mid-15th century for reasons that remain unclear.<ref name="HIS"/>

The historic Native American tribes in the area at the time of European encounter spoke different languages of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] family. They included the [[Shawnee]], [[Miami people|Miami]], and [[Illiniwek|Illini]]. Refugee tribes from eastern regions, including the [[Delaware Nation|Delaware]] who settled in the White and Whitewater River Valleys, later joined them.

===European exploration and sovereignty===

 [[File:Natives guiding french explorers through indiana.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Native Indians guide French explorers through Indiana, as depicted by [[Maurice Thompson]] in ''Stories of Indiana'']]

In 1679, French explorer [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] was the first European to cross into Indiana after reaching present-day [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] at the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph River]].<ref>Allison, p. 17.</ref> He returned the following year to learn about the region. French-Canadian [[fur trade]]rs soon arrived, bringing blankets, jewelry, tools, whiskey and weapons to trade for skins with the Native Americans.

By 1702, [[Louis Juchereau de St. Denis|Sieur Juchereau]] established the first trading post near [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]]. In 1715, [[Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes|Sieur de Vincennes]] built [[Fort Miami (Indiana)|Fort Miami]] at [[Kekionga]], now [[Fort Wayne]]. In 1717, another Canadian, [[Picote de Beletre]], built [[Fort Ouiatenon]] on the [[Wabash River]], to try to control Native American trade routes from [[Lake Erie]] to the [[Mississippi River]].

In 1732, Sieur de Vincennes built a second fur trading post at Vincennes. French Canadian settlers, who had left the earlier post because of hostilities, returned in larger numbers. In a period of a few years, British colonists arrived from the East and contended against the Canadians for control of the lucrative fur trade. Fighting between the French and British colonists occurred throughout the 1750s as a result.

The Native American tribes of Indiana sided with the French Canadians during the [[French and Indian War]] (also known as the [[Seven Years' War]]). With British victory in 1763, the French were forced to cede to the British crown all their lands in North America east of the Mississippi River and north and west of the [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]].

The tribes in Indiana did not give up: they captured [[Fort Ouiatenon]] and [[Forts of Fort Wayne, Indiana#Fort Miami|Fort Miami]] during [[Pontiac's Rebellion]]. The British royal proclamation of 1763 designated the land west of the [[Appalachians]] for Native American use, and excluded British colonists from the area, which the Crown called "Indian Territory".

In 1775, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began as the colonists sought self-government and independence from the British. The majority of the fighting took place near the East Coast, but the Patriot military officer [[George Rogers Clark]] called for an army to help fight the British in the west.<ref>Brill, p. 31–32.</ref> Clark's army won significant battles and took over [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] and [[Fort Sackville]] on February 25, 1779.<ref name="NO">{{cite web |title=Northwest Ordinance of 1787 |url=https://www.in.gov/history/2695.htm#events |access-date=July 24, 2009 |publisher=State of Indiana}}</ref>

During the war, Clark managed to cut off British troops, who were attacking the eastern colonists from the west. His success is often credited for changing the course of the American Revolutionary War.<ref>Brill, p. 33.</ref> At the end of the war, through the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], the British crown ceded their claims to the land south of the Great Lakes to the newly formed United States, including Native American lands.

In 1787, the U.S. defined the [[Northwest Territory]] which included the area of present-day Indiana.

Starting with the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794 and the [[Treaty of Greenville]] in 1795, Native American titles to Indiana lands were extinguished by usurpation, purchase, or war and treaty. About half the state was acquired in the [[Treaty of St. Mary's]] from the Miami in 1818. Purchases were not complete until the [[Treaty of Mississinewas]] in 1826 acquired the last of the reserved Native American lands in the northeast.

A portrait of the Indiana frontier about 1810: The frontier was defined by the [[Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809)|Treaty of Fort Wayne]] in 1809, adding much of the southwestern lands around Vincennes and southeastern lands adjacent to Cincinnati, to areas along the Ohio River as part of U.S. territory. Settlements were military outposts such as Fort Ouiatenon in the northwest and Fort Miami (later Fort Wayne) in the northeast, Fort Knox and Vincennes settlement on the lower Wabash. Other settlements included Clarksville (across from Louisville), Vevay, and Corydon along the Ohio River, the Quaker Colony in Richmond on the eastern border, and Conner's Post (later Connersville) on the east central frontier. Indianapolis would not be populated for 15 more years, and central and northern Indiana Territory remained wilderness populated primarily by Indigenous communities. Only two counties in the extreme southeast, Clark and Dearborn, had been organized by European settlers. Land titles issued out of Cincinnati were sparse. Settler migration was chiefly via flatboat on the Ohio River westerly, and by wagon trails up the Wabash/White River Valleys (west) and Whitewater River Valleys (east).

In 1810, the [[Shawnee]] tribal chief [[Tecumseh]] and his brother [[Tenskwatawa]] encouraged other indigenous tribes in the territory to resist European settlement. Tensions rose and the U.S. authorized Harrison to launch a preemptive expedition against [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]]; the U.S. gained victory at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] on November 7, 1811. Tecumseh was killed in 1813 during the [[Battle of Thames]]. After his death, armed resistance to United States control ended in the region. Most Native American tribes in the state were later [[Indian removals in Indiana|removed]] to west of the [[Mississippi River]] in the 1820s and 1830s after U.S. negotiations and the purchase of their lands.<ref>Brill, pp. 36–37.</ref>

===Statehood and settlement===

[[Corydon, Indiana|Corydon]], a town in the far southern part of Indiana, was named the second capital of the Indiana Territory in May 1813 in order to decrease the threat of Native American raids following the Battle of Tippecanoe.<ref name="GAC"/> Two years later, a petition for statehood was approved by the territorial general assembly and sent to Congress. An [[Enabling Act]] was passed to provide an election of delegates to write a [[constitution of Indiana|constitution for Indiana]]. On June 10, 1816, delegates assembled at Corydon to write the constitution, which was completed in 19 days. [[Jonathan Jennings]] was elected the fledgling state's first governor in August 1816. President [[James Madison]] approved Indiana's [[Admission to the Union|admission into the union]] as the [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|nineteenth state]] on December 11, 1816.<ref name="NO"/> In 1825, the state capital was moved from Corydon to [[Indianapolis]].<ref name="GAC"/>

Many European [[immigrants]] went west to settle in Indiana in the early 19th century. The largest immigrant group to settle in Indiana were [[German-American|Germans]], as well as many immigrants from [[Ireland]] and [[England]].

Following statehood, the new government worked to transform Indiana from a [[American frontier|frontier]] into a developed, well-populated, and thriving state, beginning significant demographic and economic changes. In 1836, the state's founders initiated a program, the [[Indiana Mammoth Internal Improvement Act]], that led to the construction of roads, [[canal]]s, railroads and state-funded public schools. The plans bankrupted the state and were a financial disaster, but increased land and produce value more than fourfold.<ref>{{cite web |last=Vanderstel |first=David G |title=The 1851 Indiana Constitution by David G.

Among its provisions were a prohibition on public debt, as well as the extension of [[suffrage]] to African-Americans.

===Civil War and late 19th-century industry===
{{Main|Indiana in the American Civil War}}
During the [[American Civil War]], Indiana became politically influential and played an important role in the affairs of the nation. Indiana was the first western state to mobilize for the United States in the war, and soldiers from Indiana participated in all the war's major engagements. The state provided 126 infantry regiments, 26 batteries of artillery and 13 regiments of cavalry to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].<ref>Funk, pp. 23–24, 163.</ref>

In 1861, Indiana was assigned a [[American Civil War#Mobilization|quota]] of 7,500 soldiers to join the [[Union Army]].<ref>Gray 1995, p. 156.</ref> So many volunteered in the first call that thousands had to be turned away. Before the war ended, Indiana had contributed 208,367 men. Casualties were over 35% among these men: 24,416 lost their lives and over 50,000 more were wounded.<ref>Funk, pp. 3–4.</ref> The only Civil War conflicts fought in Indiana were the [[Newburgh Raid]], a bloodless capture of the city; and the [[Battle of Corydon]], which occurred during [[Morgan's Raid]] leaving 15 dead, 40 wounded, and 355 captured.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Civil War; a Narrative, Red River to Appomattox|author=Foote, Shelby|publisher=Random House|year=1974|pages =343–344}}</ref>

After the war, Indiana remained a largely agricultural state. Post-war industries included mining, including limestone extraction; meatpacking; food processing, such as milling grain, distilling it into alcohol; and the building of [[wagon]]s, [[Buggy (carriage)|buggies]], farm machinery, and hardware.<ref name="INdustry">{{cite web |url=http://www.centerforhistory.org/indiana_history_main8.html |title=Indiana History Part 8 – Indiana Industrialization |website=centerforhistory.org |access-date=April 20, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707154815/http://www.centerforhistory.org/indiana_history_main8.html

In the 1920s, state politics was heavily influenced by the rise of the [[Indiana Klan]]. First organized in 1915 as a branch of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], it appealed to white Protestants alarmed by social and economic trends, including changes induced by immigration from southern and central Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Madison|first=James H.|title=The Indiana Way: A State History|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1990|isbn=9780253206091|location=Bloomington|page=292}}</ref> In the name of defending "hundred-per-cent Americanism", the Klan sought exclude from public life "[[Communism|Bolsheviks]], [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], [[Jews]], [[Negro]]es, [[Rum-running|bootleggers]], [[Pacifism|pacifists]], [[Evolutionism|evolutionists]], foreigners, and all persons it considered immoral".<ref>Martin (1992), p.190</ref>

By 1925 the Klan had 250,000 members, an estimated 30% of native-born white men.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.centerforhistory.org/indiana_history_main7.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018105327/http://www.centerforhistory.org/indiana_history_main7.html |publisher=Northern Indiana Center for History |title=Indiana History Part 7 |archive-date=October 18, 2008}}</ref><ref>Bodenhamer, David (1994) ''The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis,'' Indiana University Press, Bloomington, p. 879</ref> By 1925 over half the elected members of the [[Indiana General Assembly]], the [[governor of Indiana]], and many other high-ranking officials in local and state government were members of the Klan.

Throughout the 1930s, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] were in power and "the Klan was political poison".<ref>Martin (1992), p. 199</ref> During those years, Indiana, like the rest of the nation, was affected by the [[Great Depression]]. The economic downturn had a wide-ranging negative impact on Indiana, such as the decline of urbanization. The [[Dust Bowl]] to the west led many migrants to flee to the more industrialized Midwest. Governor [[Paul V. McNutt]]'s administration struggled to build a state-funded welfare system to help overwhelmed private charities. During his administration, spending and taxes were both cut drastically in response to the Depression, and the state government was completely reorganized. McNutt ended [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] in the state and enacted the state's first income tax. On several occasions, he declared martial law to put an end to worker strikes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countyhistory.com/doc.gov/037.htm |title=Paul V.

===Modern era===

With the conclusion of World War{{spaces}}II, Indiana rebounded to pre-Depression levels of production. Industry became the primary employer, a trend that continued into the 1960s. Urbanization during the 1950s and 1960s led to substantial growth in the state's cities. The auto, steel and pharmaceutical industries topped Indiana's major businesses. Indiana's population continued to grow after the war, exceeding five million by the 1970 census.<ref>{{cite book|title=Economic Geography|author1=Haynes, Kingsley E. |author2=Machunda, Zachary B|year=1987|pages =319–333}}</ref> In the 1960s the administration of [[Matthew E.

The state includes two natural regions of the United States: the Central Lowlands and the [[Interior Low Plateaus]].<ref>Logan, Cumings, Malott, Visher, Tucker & Reeves, p. 70</ref> 
The [[till plain]]s make up the northern and central regions of Indiana. Much of its appearance is a result of elements left behind by [[glacier]]s. Central Indiana is mainly flat with some low rolling hills (except where rivers cut deep valleys through the plain, like at the Wabash River and Sugar Creek) and soil composed of glacial sands, gravel and clay, which results in exceptional farmland.<ref name="FW"/> Northern Indiana is similar, except for the presence of higher and hillier [[terminal moraine]]s and hundreds of [[kettle lake]]s. In [[northwest Indiana]] there are various sand ridges and dunes, some reaching nearly 200 feet in height; most of them are at [[Indiana Dunes National Park]]. These are along the Lake Michigan shoreline and also inland to the [[Kankakee Outwash Plain]].

Southern Indiana is characterized by valleys and rugged, hilly terrain, contrasting with much of the state. Here, bedrock is exposed at the surface. Because of the prevalent [[Indiana limestone]], the area has many caves, caverns, and quarries.

===Time zones===

{{Main|Time in Indiana}}

Indiana is one of 13 U.S. states that are divided into more than one time zone. Indiana's [[time zone]]s have fluctuated over the past century. At present most of the state observes [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]; six counties near Chicago and six near Evansville observe [[Central Time Zone (North America)|Central Time]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timetemperature.com/tzus/indiana_time_zone.shtml|title=Indiana Time Zone|website=www.timetemperature.com}}</ref> Debate continues on the matter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/usa/indiana|title=Time Zones in Indiana, United States|website=www.timeanddate.com}}</ref>

Before 2006, most of Indiana did not observe [[daylight saving time]] (DST). Some counties within this area, particularly [[Floyd County, Indiana|Floyd]], [[Clark County, Indiana|Clark]], and [[Harrison County, Indiana|Harrison]] counties near [[Louisville, Kentucky]], and [[Ohio County, Indiana|Ohio]] and [[Dearborn County, Indiana|Dearborn]] counties near [[Cincinnati]], Ohio, unofficially observed DST by local custom.

[[File:IndianaStateHouse1.jpg|thumb|The [[Indiana Statehouse]] in [[Indianapolis]], seat of [[Government of Indiana|Indiana's state government]], hosts the [[Indiana General Assembly]], the [[Indiana Supreme Court]], and the [[Governor of Indiana]].]]
[[File:1816 Indiana Constitution - DPLA - 638529f8d3cb7f846cb4d281a6314e78 (page 10).jpg|thumb|[[Constitution of Indiana]] (1816)]]

Indiana has a constitutional democratic republican form of government with three branches: the executive, including an elected governor and lieutenant governor; the legislative, consisting of an elected [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] General Assembly; and the judicial, the Supreme Court of Indiana, the Indiana Court of Appeals and circuit courts.

The [[Governor of Indiana]] serves as the state's chief executive and has the authority to manage the government as established in the Constitution of Indiana. The governor and the [[Lieutenant Governor of Indiana|lieutenant governor]] are jointly elected to four-year terms, with gubernatorial elections running concurrently with United States presidential elections (1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, etc.).<ref name="ST"/> The governor may not serve more than two consecutive terms.<ref name="ST"/> The governor works with the [[Indiana General Assembly]] and the [[Indiana Supreme Court]] to govern the state and has the authority to adjust the other branches. The governor can call special sessions of the General Assembly and select and remove leaders of nearly all state departments, boards and commissions. Other notable powers include calling out the [[Indiana Guard Reserve]] or the [[Indiana National Guard]] in times of emergency or disaster, issuing pardons or commuting the sentence of any criminal offenders except in cases of treason or impeachment and possessing an abundant amount of statutory authority.<ref name="ST">{{cite web|url=http://www.state.in.us/portal/files/WebPageFactsBooklet.pdf|title=Indiana Facts|publisher=State of Indiana|access-date=August 3, 2009|archive-date=March 18, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318110223/http://www.state.in.us/portal/files/WebPageFactsBooklet.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Indiana State Chamber of Commerce (2007), p. 10.</ref><ref>{{cite web| title =Indiana Constitution Article 5| date =February 25, 1999| publisher =Indiana University| url =http://www.law.indiana.edu/uslawdocs/inconst/art-5.html| access-date =August 3, 2009| archive-date =March 10, 2009| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090310200401/http://www.law.indiana.edu/uslawdocs/inconst/art-5.html| url-status =dead}}</ref>

The lieutenant governor serves as the President of the Senate and ensures the senate rules are acted in accordance with by its constituents. The lieutenant governor votes only when needed to break ties. If the governor dies in office, becomes permanently incapacitated, resigns or is impeached, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. If both the governor and lieutenant governor positions are unoccupied, the Senate President pro tempore becomes governor.<ref>Indiana State Chamber of Commerce (2007), p. 13.</ref>

The Indiana General Assembly is composed of a 50-member [[Indiana Senate|Senate]] and 100-member [[Indiana House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The Senate is the [[upper house]] of the General Assembly and the House of Representatives is the [[lower house]].<ref name="ST" /> The General Assembly has exclusive legislative authority within the state government. Both the Senate and the House can introduce legislation, with the exception that the Senate is not authorized to initiate legislation that will affect revenue. Bills are debated and passed separately in each house, but both houses must pass them before they can be submitted to the Governor.<ref name="For">{{cite web| title =Indiana Constitution Article 4| date =February 25, 1999| publisher =Indiana University| url =http://www.law.indiana.edu/uslawdocs/inconst/art-4.html| access-date =August 3, 2009| archive-date =August 1, 2018| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20180801103208/http://www.law.indiana.edu/uslawdocs/inconst/art-4.html| url-status =dead}}</ref> The legislature can nullify a veto from the governor with a majority vote of full membership in the Senate and House of Representatives.<ref name="ST" /> Each law passed by the General Assembly must apply without exception to the entire state.

The [[Indiana Supreme Court]] is made up of five judges with a [[Indiana Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] composed of 15 judges. The governor selects judges for the supreme and appeals courts from a group of applicants chosen by a special commission. After serving for two years, the judges must acquire the support of the electorate to serve for a 10-year term.<ref name="ST" /> In nearly all cases, the Supreme Court does not have [[original jurisdiction]] and can hear only cases petitioned to it after being heard in lower courts. Local circuit courts are where most cases begin with a trial and the consequence is decided by the jury. The Supreme Court has original and sole jurisdiction in certain areas including the practice of law, discipline or disbarment of Judges appointed to the lower state courts, and supervision over the exercise of jurisdiction by the other lower courts of the State.<ref name="Fur">{{cite web| title =Indiana Constitution Article 7| date =February 25, 1999| publisher =Indiana University| url =http://www.law.indiana.edu/uslawdocs/inconst/art-7.html| access-date =August 3, 2009| archive-date =August 2, 2009| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090802221214/http://www.law.indiana.edu/uslawdocs/inconst/art-7.html| url-status =dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/judiciary/supreme/appellate.html |title=Appellate Process |publisher=State of Indiana |date=February 4, 2009 |access-date=August 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723101408/http://www.in.gov/judiciary/supreme/appellate.html |archive-date=July 23, 2009 }}</ref>

The state is divided into 92 [[County (United States)|counties]], which are led by a board of county commissioners. 90 counties in Indiana have their own [[circuit court]] with a judge elected for a six-year term. The remaining two counties, Dearborn and Ohio, are combined into one circuit. Many counties operate [[superior court]]s in addition to the circuit court. In densely populated counties where the caseload is traditionally greater, separate courts have been established to solely hear either juvenile, criminal, probate or small claims cases. The establishment, frequency and jurisdiction of these additional courts vary greatly from county to county. There are 85 city and town courts in Indiana municipalities, created by local ordinance, typically handling minor offenses and not considered [[courts of record]]. County officials elected to four-year terms include an auditor, recorder, treasurer, sheriff, coroner and clerk of the circuit court. All incorporated cities in Indiana have a mayor and council form of municipal government. Towns are governed by a town council and townships are governed by a township trustee and advisory board.<ref name="ST" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/judiciary/2674.htm|title=Indiana Trial Courts: Types of Courts|publisher=State of Indiana|access-date=May 4, 2014|archive-date=May 4, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504172406/http://www.in.gov/judiciary/2674.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Indiana is home to several current and former [[Military base|military installations]]. The largest of these is the [[Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division]], approximately 25 miles southwest of [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], which is the third-largest naval installation in the world, comprising approximately 108 square miles of territory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.navsea.navy.mil/Home/Warfare-Centers/NSWC-Crane/Who-We-Are/|title=About Us|website=www.navsea.navy.mil}}</ref> Located inside NSWC Crane is Constitution Grove, a 64,000-acre forest containing approximately 120 old-growth [[white oak]] trees selected for the maintenance of the [[USS Constitution]], the world's oldest commissioned warship still afloat.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Museum |first=USS Constitution |date=2015-05-11 |title=The "Wooden Walls" of USS Constitution |url=https://ussconstitutionmuseum.org/2015/05/11/the-wooden-walls/ |access-date=2024-04-25 |website=USS Constitution Museum |language=en}}</ref> 

Other active installations include [[Air National Guard]] fighter units at [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], and [[Terre Haute]] airports (to be consolidated at Fort Wayne under the [[Base Realignment and Closure, 2005|2005 BRAC proposal]], with the Terre Haute facility remaining open as a non-flying installation). The [[Army National Guard]] conducts operations at [[Camp Atterbury]] in [[Edinburgh, Indiana]], helicopter operations out of [[Shelbyville, Indiana|Shelbyville]] Airport and urban training at [[Muscatatuck Urban Training Center]]. The Army's [[Newport Chemical Depot]], which is now closed and turning into a coal purifier plant.

Indiana was formerly home to two major military installations; [[Grissom Air Force Base]] near Peru (realigned to an [[Air Force Reserve]] installation in 1994) and [[Fort Benjamin Harrison]] near Indianapolis, now closed, though the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] continues to operate a large finance center there ([[Defense Finance and Accounting Service]]).

The NBA's [[Indiana Pacers]] play their home games at [[Gainbridge Fieldhouse]]; they began play in 1967 in the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA) and joined the NBA when the leagues [[ABA-NBA merger|merged]] in 1976. Although [[James Naismith]] developed basketball in [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], [[Massachusetts]] in 1891, high school basketball was born in Indiana. In 1925, Naismith visited an Indiana basketball state finals game along with 15,000 screaming fans and later wrote "Basketball really had its origin in Indiana, which remains the center of the sport." The 1986 film ''[[Hoosiers (film)|Hoosiers]]'' is inspired by the story of the 1954 Indiana state champions [[1954 Milan High School basketball team|Milan High School]].

Indianapolis is home to the [[Indianapolis Colts]]. The Colts are members of the [[AFC South|South Division]] of the [[American Football Conference]]. The Colts have roots back to 1913 as the [[Dayton Triangles]]. They became an official team after moving to [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland|MD]], in 1953. In 1984, the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Colts]] [[Baltimore Colts relocation controversy|relocated]] to Indianapolis, leading to an eventual rivalry with the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. After calling the [[RCA Dome]] home for 25 years, the Colts play their home games at [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] in Indianapolis. While in Baltimore, the Colts won [[Super Bowl V]]. In Indianapolis, the Colts won [[Super Bowl XLI]], bringing the franchise total to two. In recent years the Colts have regularly competed in the NFL playoffs.

Indiana was home to two charter members of the [[National Football League]] teams, the [[Hammond Pros]] and the [[Muncie Flyers]]. Another early NFL franchise, the [[Evansville Crimson Giants]] spent two seasons in the league before folding.

Despite its reliance on manufacturing, Indiana has been less affected by declines in traditional [[Rust Belt]] manufacturers than many of its neighbors. The explanation appears to be certain factors in the labor market. First, much of the heavy manufacturing, such as industrial machinery and steel, requires highly skilled labor, and firms are often willing to locate where hard-to-train skills already exist. Second, Indiana's labor force is primarily in medium-sized and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolises. This makes it possible for firms to offer somewhat lower wages for these skills than would normally be paid. Firms often see in Indiana a chance to obtain higher than average skills at lower than average wages.<ref>{{citation |title=Manufacturers in Indiana | publisher=Purdue University Center for Rural Development | date=July 19, 1998}}</ref>

Indiana is in the U.S. [[Corn Belt]] and [[Grain Belt]]. It has a feedlot-style system raising corn to fatten hogs and cattle. Along with corn, [[soybeans]] are also a major cash crop. Its proximity to large urban centers, such as [[Indianapolis]] and Chicago, assure dairying, egg production, and specialty horticulture occur. Other crops include melons, tomatoes, grapes, mint, popping corn, and tobacco in the southern counties.<ref>{{cite web | title=USDA Crop Profiles | publisher=United States Department of Agriculture | url=http://cipm.ncsu.edu/cropprofiles/cplist.cfm?org=state | access-date=November 20, 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070223130933/http://cipm.ncsu.edu/cropprofiles/cplist.cfm?org=state <!--bot retrieved archive--> |archive-date = February 23, 2007}}</ref> Most of the original land was not prairie and had to be cleared of deciduous trees.

===State budget===

Indiana does not have a legal requirement to balance the state budget either in law or its constitution. Instead, it has a constitutional ban on assuming debt. The state has a [[Rainy Day Fund]] and for healthy reserves proportional to spending. Indiana is one of six U.S. states to not allow a [[Line-item veto in the United States|line-item veto]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/budget-tax/gubernatorial-veto-authority-with-respect-to-major.aspx|title=Gubernatorial Veto Authority with Respect to Major Budget Bill(s)|publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures|access-date=September 11, 2017|archive-date=January 29, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129031718/http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/budget-tax/gubernatorial-veto-authority-with-respect-to-major.aspx|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Indiana's power production chiefly consists of the consumption of fossil fuels, mainly coal. It has 24 coal power plants, including the country's largest coal power plant, [[Gibson Generating Station]], across the Wabash River from [[Mount Carmel, Illinois]]. Indiana is also home to the coal-fired plant with the highest sulfur dioxide emissions in the United States, the [[R. Gallagher Generating Station|Gallagher]] power plant, just west of New Albany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jul2007/2007-07-26-05.asp|title=50 Dirtiest U.S. Power Plants Named|last=staff|website=Ens-newswire.com|access-date=September 2, 2017|archive-date=May 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525200756/http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jul2007/2007-07-26-05.asp|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2010, Indiana had estimated coal reserves of 57&nbsp;billion tons, and state mining operations produced 35&nbsp;million tons of coal annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://igs.indiana.edu/coal/index.cfm|title=Coal in Indiana|author=Indiana Geological Survey|publisher=[[Purdue University]]|access-date=October 19, 2010}}</ref> Indiana also has at least 900&nbsp;million barrels of petroleum reserves in the [[Trenton Gas Field|Trenton Field]], though they are not easily recoverable. While Indiana has made commitments to increasing the use of renewable resources such as wind, hydroelectric, biomass, or solar power, progress has been very slow, mainly because of the continued abundance of coal in southern Indiana. Most of the new plants in the state have been [[coal gasification]] plants. Another source is hydroelectric power.

[[Wind power in Indiana|Wind power]] has been growing rapidly. Estimates in 2006 raised Indiana's wind capacity from 30 MW at 50 m turbine height to 40,000 MW at 70 m, and to 130,000 MW at 100 m, in 2010, the height of newer turbines.<ref>[http://www.indianacleanpower.org/renewableresources.html Indiana's Renewable Energy Resources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209233955/http://www.indianacleanpower.org/renewableresources.html |date=February 9, 2014 }} Retrieved August 20, 2008</ref> By the end of 2011, Indiana had installed 1,340 MW of wind turbines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windpoweringamerica.gov/wind_installed_capacity.asp |title=WINDExchange: U.S. Installed Wind Capacity |website=windpoweringamerica.gov |access-date=February 24, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314233108/http://www.windpoweringamerica.gov/wind_installed_capacity.asp |archive-date=March 14, 2014 }}</ref> In 2020, this total had more than doubled to 2,968 MW.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://neo.ne.gov/programs/stats/inf/205.htm |date=April 13, 2022 |title=Wind Energy Installed Capacity by State }}</ref>

===Transportation===

====Airports====

{{See also|List of airports in Indiana}}

[[Indianapolis International Airport]] serves the greater Indianapolis area. It opened in November 2008 and offers a midfield passenger terminal, concourses, air traffic control tower, parking garage, and airfield and apron improvements.<ref>{{cite web | title=New Indianapolis Airport | publisher=Indianapolis Airport Authority | url=http://www.indianapolisairport.com/ | access-date=January 6, 2007 | archive-date=February 2, 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202010611/http://www.indianapolisairport.com/ | url-status=dead }}</ref>

Other major airports include [[Evansville Regional Airport]], [[Fort Wayne International Airport]] (which houses the [[122d Fighter Wing]] of the [[Air National Guard]]), and [[South Bend International Airport]]. A long-standing proposal to turn [[Gary Chicago International Airport]] into Chicago's third major airport received a boost in early 2006 with the approval of $48{{spaces}}million in federal funding over the next ten years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gary Airpport Gets Millions in Federal Funding |publisher=CBS Channel 2 |url=http://cbs2chicago.com/topstories/local_story_016180843.html |access-date=October 18, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218014515/http://cbs2chicago.com/topstories/local_story_016180843.html |archive-date=February 18, 2006 }}</ref>

No airlines operate out of [[Terre Haute Regional Airport]] but it is used primarily for general aviation. Since 1954, the [[181st Fighter Wing]] of the Indiana [[Air National Guard]] was stationed there, but the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] (BRAC) Proposal of 2005 stated the 181st would lose its fighter mission and [[F-16]] aircraft, leaving the Terre Haute facility a general-aviation-only facility.

[[Louisville International Airport]], across the Ohio River in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], serves southern Indiana, as does [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport]] in [[Hebron, Kentucky]]. Many residents of [[Northwest Indiana]], which is primarily in the [[Chicago Metropolitan Area]], use Chicago's airports, [[O'Hare International Airport]] and [[Chicago Midway International Airport]].{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The U.S. [[List of Interstate Highways in Indiana|Interstate highways in Indiana]] are [[Interstate 64 in Indiana|I-64]], [[Interstate 65 in Indiana|I-65]], [[Interstate 265 in Indiana|I-265]], [[Interstate 465|I-465]], [[Interstate 865|I-865]], [[Interstate 69 in Indiana|I-69]], [[Interstate 469|I-469]], [[Interstate 70 in Indiana|I-70]], [[Interstate 74 in Indiana|I-74]], [[Interstate 80 in Indiana|I-80]], [[Interstate 90 in Indiana|I-90]], [[Interstate 94 in Indiana|I-94]], and [[Interstate 275 (Ohio–Indiana–Kentucky)|I-275]]. The various highways intersecting in and around [[Indianapolis]], along with its historical status as a major railroad hub, and the canals that once crossed Indiana, are the source of the state's motto, the Crossroads of America. There are also many [[List of U.S. Routes in Indiana|U.S. routes]] and [[List of State Roads in Indiana|state highways]] maintained by the [[Indiana Department of Transportation]]. These are numbered according to the same convention as [[U.S. Highways]]. Indiana allows highways of different classifications to have the same number. For example, I-64 and [[Indiana State Road 64]] both exist (rather close to each other) in Indiana, but are two distinct roads with no relation to one another.

A $3&nbsp;billion project extending I-69 is underway. The project was divided into six sections, with the first five sections (linking [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]] to [[Martinsville, Indiana|Martinsville]]) now complete. The sixth and final phase from Martinsville to Indianapolis is under construction. When complete, I-69 will traverse an additional {{convert|142|mi|km|}} through the state.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lange|first=Kaitlin|title=I-69 completion date pushed back|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/13/-69-completion-date-pushed-back/97850844/|access-date=September 3, 2017|work=The Indianapolis Star|date=February 13, 2017}}</ref>

====County roads====

Most Indiana counties use a grid-based system to identify county roads; this system replaced the older arbitrary system of road numbers and names, and (among other things) makes it much easier to identify the sources of calls placed to the [[9-1-1]] system. Such systems are easier to implement in the glacially flattened northern and central portions of the state. Rural counties in the southern third of the state are less likely to have grids and more likely to rely on unsystematic road names (for example, Crawford, Harrison, Perry, Scott, and Washington Counties).

There are also counties in the northern portions of the state that have never implemented a grid or have only partially implemented one. Some counties are also laid out in an almost diamond-like grid system (e.g., Clark, Floyd, Gibson, and Knox Counties). Such a system is also almost useless in those situations as well. Knox County once operated two different grid systems for county roads because the county was laid out using two different survey grids, but has since decided to use road names and combine roads instead.

Notably, the county road grid system of St. Joseph County, whose major city is South Bend, uses perennial (tree) names (i.e. Ash, Hickory, Ironwood, etc.) in alphabetical order for north–south roads and presidential and other noteworthy names (i.e., Adams, Edison, Lincoln Way, etc.) in alphabetical order for east–west roads. There are exceptions to this rule in downtown South Bend and Mishawaka. Hamilton County's east–west roads continue Indianapolis's numbered street system from 96th Street at the Marion County line to 296th street at the Tipton County line.

====Rail====

[[File:07 21 09 006xRP - Flickr - drewj1946.jpg|thumb|A [[South Shore Line|South Shore]] commuter train in [[Michigan City, Indiana|Michigan City]]]]

Indiana has more than {{convert|4,255|mi||adj=pre|railroad route }}, of which 91% are operated by [[Class&nbsp;I railroad]]s, principally [[CSX Transportation]] and the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]. Other Class{{spaces}}I railroads in Indiana include the [[Canadian National Railway]] and [[Soo Line Railroad]], a [[Canadian Pacific Kansas City|CPKC]] subsidiary, as well as [[Amtrak]]. The remaining miles are operated by 37 regional, local, and switching and terminal railroads. The [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore Line]] is one of the country's most notable commuter rail systems, extending from Chicago to [[South Bend]]. Indiana is implementing an extensive rail plan prepared in 2002 by the [[Parsons Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Indiana Rail Plan | publisher=Indiana Department of Transportation | url=http://www.in.gov/indot/3065.htm | access-date=August 24, 2009 | archive-date=August 18, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818033454/http://www.in.gov/indot/3065.htm | url-status=dead }}</ref> Many recreational trails, such as the [[Monon Trail]] and [[Cardinal Greenway]], have been created from [[rails-to-trails|abandoned rails routes]].

====Ports====

===Public schools===

[[File:Shortridge High School Indianapolis Aug 2016.jpg|thumb|Established in 1864, [[Shortridge High School]] in Indianapolis is Indiana's oldest free public high school.<ref>{{cite web |last=Herron |first=Arika |title=Shortridge named state's 'most beautiful' public high school |url=https://www.indystar.com/story/news/education/2017/09/18/shortridge-named-states-most-beautiful-public-high-school/678804001/ |work=The Indianapolis Star |date=September 18, 2017 |access-date=March 13, 2024}}</ref>]]

Indiana's 1816 constitution was the first in the country to implement a state-funded [[public school (government funded)|public school]] system. It also allotted one township for a public university.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> However, the plan turned out to be far too idealistic for a pioneer society, as tax money was not accessible for its organization. In the 1840s, [[Caleb Mills]] pressed the need for tax-supported schools, and in 1851 his advice was included in the new state constitution. In 1843 the Legislature ruled that African Americans could not attend the public schools, leading to the foundation of [[Union Literary Institute]] and other schools for them, funded by donations or the students themselves.<ref name="cepr.indiana.edu">{{cite web|title=Examining the Cross-roads: School Segregation in Indiana: Center for Evaluation, Policy, & Research: Indiana University Bloomington|url=https://cepr.indiana.edu/segregation.html|access-date=February 10, 2022|website=Center for Evaluation, Policy, & Research|language=en-US}}</ref> The Indiana General Assembly authorized separate but equal schools for Black students in 1869, and in 1877 language in the law changed to allow for integrated schools.<ref name="cepr.indiana.edu"/>

Although the growth of the public school system was held up by legal entanglements, many public elementary schools were in use by 1870. Most children in Indiana attend public schools, but nearly ten percent attend private schools and [[parochial school]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.in.gov/doe/about/news/indiana-k-12-school-enrollment-grows-for-2021-2022-school-year/#:~:text=More%20than%2083%2C000%20students%20currently,comprises%207.4%25%20of%20Indiana's%20students.|title=Indiana K-12 School Enrollment grows for 2021-2022 School Year|date=January 20, 2022 |accessdate=November 12, 2022}}</ref> About half of all college students in Indiana are enrolled in state-supported four-year schools.

Indiana public schools have gone through several changes throughout Indiana's history. Modern, public school standards, have been implemented all throughout the state. These new standards were adopted in April 2014. The overall goal of these new state standards is to ensure Indiana students have the necessary skills and requirements needed to enter college or the workforce upon high school graduation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Academic Standards |url=https://www.doe.in.gov/standards |website=Indiana Department of Education |access-date=November 4, 2018 |archive-date=November 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105012744/https://www.doe.in.gov/standards |url-status=dead }}</ref> State standards can be found for nearly every major subject taught in Indiana public schools. Mathematics, English/Language Arts, Science, and Social Studies are among the top, prioritized standards. In 2022, the [[Indiana Department of Education]] reported that the state's overall graduation rate was 86.7%, down one percent from 2021.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Roberts |first=Mary |title=State Releases 2021 Graduation Rates |url=https://www.insideindianabusiness.com/articles/state-releases-2021-graduation-rates |access-date=July 21, 2022 |website=Inside INdiana Business |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Vocational schools===
Indiana has a strong vocational school system. [[Charles Allen Prossor]], known as the father of [[vocational education]] in the United States, was from [[New Albany, Indiana|New Albany]]. The [[Charles Allen Prosser School of Technology]] is named in his honor. There are vocational schools in every region of Indiana, and most Indiana students can freely attend a vocational school during their high school years and receive training and job placement assistance in trade jobs. The International Union Of Operating Engineers (IUOE) has seven local unions in Indiana, offering apprenticeship and training opportunities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Local Unions by State/Province|url=https://www.iuoe.org/join-iuoe/local-unions-by-state-province|access-date=November 11, 2021|website=www.iuoe.org}}</ref> According to the Electrical Training Alliance website, there are ten electrical training centers in Indiana.<ref>{{cite web|title=electrical training ALLIANCE for the IBEW and NECA|url=http://electricaltrainingalliance.org/AboutUs|access-date=November 11, 2021|website=electricaltrainingalliance.org}}</ref>

===Colleges and universities===
{{See also|List of colleges and universities in Indiana}}
The state's community college system, [[Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana]], serves nearly 200,000 students annually, making it the state's largest public post-secondary educational institution and the nation's largest singly accredited statewide community college system.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ivy Tech Reports Record Enrollment |url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?id=49433 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017093819/http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?id=49433 |archive-date=October 17, 2014 |access-date=July 23, 2014 |website=Insideindianabusiness.com}}</ref> In 2008, the Indiana University system agreed to shift most of its associate (2-year) degrees to the Ivy Tech Community College System.<ref>{{cite web |date=May 16, 2008 |title=Hoosier State Gets Coordinated |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/05/16/indiana |access-date=March 21, 2014 |website=Inside Higher Ed}}</ref>

The largest non-community educational institution is [[Indiana University]], a multi-campus university system; its [[Indiana University Bloomington|flagship campus at Bloomington]] was endorsed as the Indiana Seminary in 1820. [[Indiana State University]] was established in Terre Haute as the state's [[Normal School]] in 1865. [[Purdue University]] was chartered in West Lafayette as the state's [[land-grant university]] in 1869 and is also now a multi-campus institution. The three other independent state universities are [[Vincennes University]] (founded in 1801 by the Indiana Territory), [[Ball State University]] (founded 1918 as the East Division of Indiana State), and the [[University of Southern Indiana]] (founded 1965 as the Evansville campus of Indiana State).

Many of Indiana's private colleges and universities are affiliated with religious organizations. The [[University of Notre Dame]], [[Marian University (Indiana)|Marian University]], and the [[University of Saint Francis (Indiana)|University of Saint Francis]] are [[Roman Catholic school]]s. Universities affiliated with Protestant denominations include [[Anderson University (Indiana)|Anderson University]], [[Butler University]], [[Huntington University (United States)|Huntington University]], [[Manchester University (Indiana)|Manchester University]], [[Indiana Wesleyan University]], [[Taylor University]], [[Franklin College (Indiana)|Franklin College]], [[Hanover College]], [[DePauw University]], [[Earlham College]], [[Valparaiso University]], the [[University of Indianapolis]],<ref name="ST"/> and the [[University of Evansville]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About UE |publisher=[[University of Evansville]] |url=http://www.evansville.edu/aboutue/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106123440/http://www.evansville.edu/aboutue/ |archive-date=January 6, 2010 }}</ref>

The state has several universities ranked among the best by ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''. The University of Notre Dame ranks among the top 20, Purdue University among the top 50, and Indiana University Bloomington among the top 100.<ref>{{Cite web |title=University of Notre Dame |url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/university-of-notre-dame-1840}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Purdue University-West Lafayette |url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/purdue-university-west-lafayette-1825}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Indiana University-Bloomington |url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/indiana-university-bloomington-1809}}</ref> [[Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis]] (IUPUI) has recently made it into the top 200 ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' rankings.
