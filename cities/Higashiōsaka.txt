==History==
The location of Higashiōsaka corresponds to the central part of [[Kawachi Province]]. In ancient times, this area was an extension of [[Osaka Bay]] called Kawachi Bay, which gradually became separated from the sea and became a lake. The lake gradually became land due to the accumulation of sediment by the [[Yamato River]]. During the [[Kofun period|Kofun]] and [[Asuka period]]s, this was the homeland of the [[Mononobe clan]], and was on the main road between the [[Nara Basin|Yamato Basin]] and the port at Naniwa, with sea connections to the Asian continent. During the [[Heian period]], the area was largely controlled by [[Hiraoka Shrine]]. From the [[Muromachi period]], it was the base of the [[Hatakeyama clan]] to control Kawachi Province, but due to internal conflicts it can under the control of the [[Miyoshi clan]]. Later it was the site of battles during the 1615 [[Siege of Osaka]]. In the [[Edo Period]], flood control projects on the Yamato River created a large amount of reclaimed land, which was developed by wealthy Osaka merchants for rice and cotton production.

The modern city was founded on February 1, 1967, by a merger of three cities, {{nihongo|Fuse|布施}}, {{nihongo|[[Kawachi, Osaka|Kawachi]]|河内}} and {{nihongo|Hiraoka|枚岡}}. On April 1, 2005, Higashiōsaka became a [[Core cities of Japan|Core city]] with increased local autonomy.
