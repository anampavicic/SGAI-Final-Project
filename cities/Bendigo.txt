'''Bendigo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛ|n|d|ᵻ|ɡ|oʊ}} {{respell|BEN|dig|oh}}) is a city in north-central [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], located in the [[Bendigo Valley]] near the geographical centre of the state<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110314154704/http://www.bendigo.vic.gov.au/page/page.asp?page_Id=1711&h=0 Plaque to mark Exact Centre of Victoria - 12/10/2006] City of Greater Bendigo</ref> and approximately {{convert|150|km|mi|0}} north-west of [[Melbourne]], the state capital.

As of 2022, Bendigo has a population of 103,818 making it Australia's 19th-largest [[List of cities in Australia by population|city by population]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Statistics |title=Population estimates by LGA, Significant Urban Area, Remoteness Area and electoral division, 2001 to 2022 |url=https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/regional-population/latest-release |access-date=23 Jan 2024 |website=abs.gov.au |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |language=en}}</ref> Bendigo is the fourth-largest inland city in Australia and the fourth-most populous city in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

Bendigo is administered by the [[City of Greater Bendigo]], formerly the [[City of Bendigo]]. The council area encompasses roughly 3,000 square kilometres,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Our region {{!}} City of Greater Bendigo |url=https://www.bendigo.vic.gov.au/about-us/our-region |access-date=2023-12-16 |website=www.bendigo.vic.gov.au |language=en}}</ref> the city is surrounded by smaller towns such as [[Castlemaine, Victoria|Castlemaine]], [[Heathcote, Victoria|Heathcote]], [[Kyneton]], [[Maryborough, Victoria|Maryborough]], [[Elmore, Victoria|Elmore]], [[Rochester, Victoria|Rochester]], [[Goornong]] and [[Axedale]].

The [[traditional owners]] of the area are the [[Djadjawurrung|Dja Dja Wurrung]] (Djaara) people.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Djaara (Dja Dja Wurrung Clans Aboriginal Corporation)|url=https://djadjawurrung.com.au/|access-date=2021-06-01|language=en-AU}}</ref> The discovery of gold on [[Bendigo Creek]] in 1851 transformed the area from a [[sheep station]] into one of colonial Australia's largest [[boomtown]]s. News of the finds intensified the [[Victorian gold rush]], bringing an influx of migrants from around the world, particularly Europe and China. Bendigo became Eastern Australia's largest 19th-century gold-mining economy, and the wealth generated during this period is reflected today in the city's [[Victorian architecture|Victorian architectural]] heritage. From 1853 until 1891, Bendigo was officially named Sandhurst.

Bendigo's boom period lasted until the early 20th century and after a temporary decline in population and employment, renewed growth occurred from the 1930s as the city consolidated as a manufacturing and regional service centre. Although gold mining continues, recent population growth has been most heavily concentrated in suburban areas. With the completion of the [[Calder Highway|Calder Freeway]] linking Melbourne and Bendigo in 2009, and the region's proximity to Melbourne, Bendigo has become one of the fastest-growing regional centres in Victoria.<ref name="forecast.id.com.au">[https://forecast.id.com.au/bendigo Welcome to the City of Greater Bendigo population forecasts] City of Greater Bendigo</ref>

==History==
===Indigenous history and European settlement===
[[File:Bendigo Creek ST Gill.jpg|thumb|[[Bendigo Creek]], named after a local shepherd and amateur boxer who, in turn, earned the sobriquet because his fighting style resembled that of English bare-knuckle champion [[William Thompson (boxer)|William Abednego "Bendigo" Thompson]].]]
The Traditional Owners of the [[Mount Alexander]], traditionally named Leanganook, area that includes [[City of Greater Bendigo|Greater Bendigo]], are the [[Dja Dja Wurrung]] (Djaara) people. They exploited the rich local hunting grounds from which they were displaced by the arrival by [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|white settlers]], who established the first of many vast sheep runs in 1837. The Djadjawurrung peoples experienced two waves of settlement and dispossession: from the south from 1837 and from the north from 1845.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Clark|first=Ian D.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41539940|title=Scars in the landscape : a register of massacre sites in western Victoria, 1803-1859|date=1995|publisher=Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies|isbn=0-85575-281-5|location=Canberra|oclc=41539940}}</ref> The marked decrease in Dja Dja Wurrung population was also due to the arrival of non-indigenous animals; they use their noses to ‘root up’ the nutritious [[Microseris scapigera|moon-nar tuber]] (yam daisy); after just a year it was noticed the plant was becoming scarce.<ref>Beth Gott, ‘Murnong — Microseris scapigera: a study of a staple food of Victorian Aborigines’, Australian Aboriginal Studies, no. 2, 1983, pp. 12, 14.</ref>

Squatters in the area included: Donald Campbell at Bullock Creek in [[Ravenswood, Victoria|Ravenswood]]; J & R Bakewell to the north of Bendigo; Heap & Gryce to the north-west; Archibald McDougall to the west; Joseph Raleigh and James Robinson along the [[Campaspe River]] to the south; and Thomas, Jones, and William Barnett to the east.<ref>The Squatters' directory : Containing a list of all the occupants of crown lands in the intermediate and unsettled districts of Port Phillip ... compiled from the Government Gazette ...

Becoming the sole owner of the [[Ravenswood, Victoria|Ravenswood]] run in 1857, Fenton built its substantial homestead.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Bendigo Independent (Vic. : 1891 - 1918) - 10 Apr 1917 - p2|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page24429707|access-date=2020-06-26|website=Trove|language=en}}</ref>

The area was transformed in less than a year as tens of thousands of people arrived during the great gold rush in 1852.

Widespread gold mining caused environmental devastation and permanent damage in the district, decimating and displacing the Dja Dja Wurrung<ref name=":0b">{{Cite book |last1=Lawrence |first1=Susan |title=Sludge : disaster on Victoria's goldfield |last2=Davies |first2=Peter |publisher=La Trobe University Press in conjunction with Black Inc |year=2019 |isbn=9781760641108 |edition=1st |location=Carlton, Victoria |oclc=1101283189}}</ref> and destroying the infrastructure they created over generations to maximise seasonal drainage patterns; the channels and weirs they built out of timber stakes, to slow receding summer flows, were wrecked; water holes where the people gathered in smaller groups during periods of scarce rainfall and from which they transported water in skin bags when moving, were muddied, polluted and drained; the soaks they had dug between banks into sandy sediment to tap into the water table were likewise obliterated.

[[File:Charing Cross Bendigo 1853.jpg|thumb|left|Bendigo, 1853]]
Gold was officially discovered in the area in October 1851,<ref name=":0a" /> just after the other significant goldfields in neighbouring [[Castlemaine, Victoria|Castlemaine]], from where many diggers migrated, bringing the total population to 40,000 in less than a year. Many of these diggers were Chinese and their descendants still live in the region.
[[File:Deep Gully Mine Bendigo.jpg|thumb|upright|Deep Gully Mine, 1857]]
During 1852, under the direction of [[Surveyor General of Victoria]], [[Robert Hoddle]], William Swan Urquhart was making a general survey of Mount Alexander and the surrounding ranges, and of the goldfields, and fixed the site of the township of 'Sandhurst', now Bendigo. On 13 July 1852 Hoddle passed on to Urquhart Lieutenant-Governor La Trobe's request for a plan of the Mount Alexander gold workings, and his order that he mark out a reserve at the junction of Golden Gully with Bendigo Creek, and the camp on the west side of the creek below the junction. In late August La Trobe wanted him to report urgently on the best reserves for agriculture in the district. By 26 November he had mapped Bendigo Creek and Myers Creek, and his survey of the [[Bendigo Valley]] and environs marked township reserves at Bullock Creek, Ravenswood and Happy Jack where settlement was already taking place. His plan ''General Survey of the Bendigo Goldfields showing the proposed reserves for townships. Drawn by W.S. Urquhart, Melbourne, November 1852'' recommended sites for national schools, churches, markets and other public purposes reserved from sale.<ref>{{Cite web|last=James|first=Ken|date=2009|title=The surveying career of William Swan Urquhart, 1845-1864 {{!}} PROV|url=https://prov.vic.gov.au/explore-collection/provenance-journal/provenance-2009/surveying-career-william-swan-urquhart-1845#_ednref22|access-date=2020-06-25|website=Provenance: The Journal of Public Record Office Victoria, issue no. 8, 2009.

In 1853, a massive protest called The [[Anti-Gold Licence Association|Red Ribbon Rebellion]] was held over the cost of the licence fee for prospectors, though it passed off peacefully, due to good diplomacy by police and miners' leaders. From being a tent city, the boomtown grew rapidly into a major urban centre with many grand public buildings. The municipality became a borough in 1863, officially known as [[Sandhurst (Colony of Victoria, Australia)|Sandhurst]] until 1891, but always unofficially as Bendigo.

The railway had reached Bendigo by 1862, stimulating rapid growth, with flour mills, woollen mills, tanneries, quarries, foundries, [[eucalyptus oil]] production, food production industries, and timber cutting. When the alluvial gold ran out, extraction of quartz-based gold continued in [[Shaft mining|deep shafts]] using industrial systems.

[[Selection (Australian history)|Selection]] in the future [[county of Bendigo]] (created in 1869) commenced under the Land Act of 1865, with most settlement occurring around Sandhurst and [[Eaglehawk, Victoria|Eaglehawk]].

=== Decline and regeneration ===
[[File:Sandhurst in 1884.jpg|thumb|left|Bendigo from Camp Hill, 1886]]
Bendigo was declared a city in 1871. Rapid population growth brought a water shortage, partially solved with a new viaduct that harnessed the [[Coliban River]].
The architect [[William Charles Vahland (architect)|William Charles Vahland]] (1828–1915) left an important mark on Bendigo during this period. He is credited with the popular cottage design known as a Vahland House. The cottage design that has vastly been customised shares a common theme of a central door, a sash window either side, a central hallway that runs the entire length of the house and [[verandah]]s ordained in iron lace, a style that was soon adopted across the state of Victoria. Vahland also designed more than 80 buildings, including the [[Alexandra Fountain]], arguably the most prominent monument in Bendigo, with its granite dolphins, unicorns, nymphs and allegorical figures. A [[Trams in Bendigo|tram network]] was established by 1890, some of which is still in operation as a tourism service currently.

After a temporary drop in population, renewed growth occurred from the 1930s, as the city consolidated as a manufacturing and regional service centre, though gold mining continues.{{cn|date=November 2022}} Recent growth has been most heavily concentrated in areas such as Epsom, Kangaroo Flat, Strathdale, and Strathfieldsaye.{{cn|date=November 2022}}

On 28 March 2013, the [[Djadjawurrung|Dja Dja Wurrung]] people were formally recognised as the [[traditional owner]]s for part of Central Victoria, including the land on which the City of Greater Bendigo sits.

In 1994, under municipal reforms of Victoria's [[Jeff Kennett|Kennett government]], the City of Bendigo was abolished and merged with the Borough of Eaglehawk, the Huntly and Strathfieldsaye shires, and the Rural City of Marong to form the larger City of Greater Bendigo. The population of the city increased from around 78,000 in 1991 to about 100,617 in 2012. Bendigo is currently one of the fastest-growing regional centres in Victoria.<ref name="forecast.id.com.au" />

==Geography==
The city is surrounded by components of the [[Greater Bendigo National Park]], as well as the [[Bendigo Box-Ironbark Region]] [[Important Bird Area]], identified as such by [[BirdLife International]] because of its importance for [[swift parrot]]s and other [[woodland]] birds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |title=IBA: Bendigo Box-Ironbark Region |access-date=23 October 2011 |work=Birdata |publisher=Birds Australia |archive-date=6 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706102341/http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |url-status=dead }}</ref> A dozen species of insect-eating bats and the pollinating grey-headed flying fox inhabit the area.

Bendigo was in severe drought from 2006 to 2010, and during this time, the city had some of the harshest [[water restrictions]] in Australia, with no watering outside the household.

=== Religion ===
In the 19th century, Catholicism was the predominant Christian tradition in Bendigo. Catholic priest and pioneer [[George Henry Backhaus]] established a site in 1852 for the first Masses at Golden Square and, by the end of the year, he was camping at the site of Bendigo's first church, St Kilian's Church, completed in 1858. A wealthy man, Backhaus left his estate for the benefit of the church which, in 1897, enabled the construction of [[Sacred Heart Cathedral, Bendigo|Sacred Heart Cathedral]]. Completed in 1977, it is the largest church building in provincial Australia. As of 2016, Catholicism is still practised by 22% of the population. In the 2016 census, 36.2% reported having "no religion".<ref name="census" />

The Sandhurst Methodist Circuit (1854) serviced five Wesleyan churches which had been built in previous years. There were several church schools, but they were attended by one-fifteenth of Bendigo's school children.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

===Architectural heritage===
[[File:Bendigo Building main street-01+ (573049668).jpg|thumb|left|Established in 1854, [[Shamrock Hotel, Bendigo|Shamrock Hotel]] was rebuilt in 1897.]]
As a legacy of the gold boom, Bendigo has many ornate buildings built in a late [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] colonial style. Many buildings are on the [[Victorian Heritage Register]] and registered by the [[National Trust of Australia]]. Prominent buildings include the [[Bendigo Town Hall]] (1859, 1883–85), the [[Bendigo Post Office|Old Post Office]], the [[Bendigo Law Courts]] (1892–96), the [[Shamrock Hotel, Bendigo|Shamrock Hotel]] (1897), the Institute of Technology, and the Memorial Military Museum (1921), all in the [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] style.

The architect [[William Charles Vahland (architect)|William Vahland]] encouraged European artisans to emigrate to the [[Sandhurst (Colony of Victoria, Australia)|Sandhurst]] goldfields and so create a "Vienna of the South".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110823065406/http://www.australiaforeveryone.com.au/icons_shamrock.htm "Vienna Of The South" (Bendigo), Vic] Australia for Everyone</ref> Bendigo's [[Sacred Heart Cathedral, Bendigo|Sacred Heart Cathedral]], a large sandstone church, is the third-largest cathedral in Australia and one of the largest cathedrals in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. The main building was completed between 1896 and 1908 and the spire between 1954 and 1977.

Fortuna Villa is a large surviving Victorian mansion, built for Christopher Ballerstedt and later owned by George Lansell. Many other examples of Bendigo's classical architecture rank amongst the finest classical commercial buildings in Australia and include the Colonial Bank building (1887) and the former Masonic Hall (1873–74), which is now a performing-arts centre. Bendigo's [[Chinese temple architecture|Joss House]], a historic temple, was built in the 1860s by Chinese miners and is the only surviving building of its kind in regional Victoria, which continues to be used as a place of worship. The historic Bendigo Tram Sheds and Power Station (1903) now house [[Trams in Bendigo|Bendigo's tramway museum]]. The Queen Elizabeth Oval still retains its ornate 1901 grandstand.

===Parks and gardens===
[[File:Bendigo rosalind.jpg|thumb|[[Rosalind Park]] featuring statuary and flanked by ornate Second Empire-style buildings]]

The central city is skirted by [[Rosalind Park]], a Victorian-style garden featuring statuary and a large [[basalt|blue stone]] [[viaduct]]. The main entrance corner of the park is on the intersection known as [[Charing Cross (Bendigo)|Charing Cross]], formerly the intersection of two main tram lines (now only one). It features a large statue of [[Queen Victoria]].

The Charing Cross junction features the large and ornate [[Alexandra Fountain]] (1881) and is built on top of a wide bridge that spans the [[viaduct]]. The park elevates toward Camp Hill, which features a historic school and a lookout – a former mine [[Shaft mining|poppet head]].

Further from the city is [[Lake Weroona|Lake Weeroona]], a large, ornamental lake adjacent to the Bendigo Creek. The [[Bendigo Botanic Gardens]], which opened in 1869, are further downstream. Major redevelopment of the gardens has taken place in recent years.

The gardens are home to many native species of animals, including brushtailed and ring-tailed possums, ducks, coots, purple swamp hens, microbats (small insect-eating bats), several species of lizards, owls, the tawny frogmouth, and though not native to the area,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Pallin|first1=Nancy|last2=McDonald|first2=Tein|date=January 2013|title=On-ground habitat restoration: Interview with Nancy Pallin|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/emr.12029|journal=Ecological Management & Restoration|volume=14|issue=1|pages=11–19|doi=10.1111/emr.12029|issn=1442-7001}}</ref> a colony of endangered grey-headed flying foxes ([[Grey-headed flying fox|Pteropus poliocephalus]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=Billie J.|last2=Mo|first2=Matthew|last3=Roache|first3=Mike|last4=Eby|first4=Peggy|date=2020|title=Review of dispersal attempts at flying-fox camps in Australia|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/zo20043|journal=Australian Journal of Zoology|volume=68|issue=6|pages=254|doi=10.1071/zo20043|issn=0004-959X}}</ref>

Tourism is a major component of the Bendigo economy, generating over A$364&nbsp;million in 2008/09.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://121.50.208.46/bendigo/BTB%20AnnRep%20FINAL.pdf |title=Bendigo Tourism Board Inc : Annual Report : 2008–2009 |publisher=121.50.208.46 |access-date=31 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081001/http://121.50.208.46/bendigo/BTB%20AnnRep%20FINAL.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref> Bendigo is popular with [[Heritage tourism|heritage tourists]] and [[cultural tourism|cultural tourists]] with the focus of tourism on the city's gold rush history. Prominent attractions include the [[Central Deborah Mine|Central Deborah Gold Mine]], the [[Trams in Bendigo|Bendigo Tramways]] (both of which are managed by the Bendigo Trust, a council-intertwined organisation dedicated to preserving Bendigo's heritage), the [[Golden Dragon Museum]], the [[Bendigo Pottery]], and the Great Stupa.

===Commerce===
[[File:Bendigo offices - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|Bendigo Bank (left)]]
The main retail centre of Bendigo is the central business district, with the suburbs of Eaglehawk, Kangaroo Flat, Golden Square, Strathdale, and Epsom also having shopping districts.

The city was home to one of Australia's few provincial [[stock exchanges]], the [[Bendigo Stock Exchange]] (BSX), founded in the 1860s.

The city is the home of the headquarters of the [[Bendigo Bank]], established in 1858 as a building society. It is now a large retail bank with community bank branches throughout Australia. The bank is headquartered in Bendigo and is a major employer in the city (it also has a regional office at [[Melbourne Docklands]]).

===Manufacturing===
The City of Greater Bendigo Community Profile indicated that about 10.2% of the workforce were employed in manufacturing in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://profile.id.com.au/bendigo/industries |title=Industry sector of employment &#124; City of Greater Bendigo |publisher=Profile.id |date=10 January 2011 |access-date=31 March 2015}}</ref> After the [[Victorian gold rush]], the introduction of deep quartz mining in Bendigo caused the development of a heavy manufacturing industry. Little of that now remains, but a large foundry (Keech Castings) makes mining, train, and other steel parts and a rubber factory remains (Motherson Elastomers, formerly Empire Rubber). [[Thales Australia]] (formerly ADI Limited) is an important heavy engineering company. Australia Defence Apparel is another key defence industry participant making military and police uniforms and bulletproof vests. [[Intervet]] (formerly Ausvac) is an important biotechnology company, producing vaccines for animals.

===Education===
[[File:Bendigo School of Mines.jpg|thumb|upright|Bendigo School of Mines]]
The [[Bendigo Senior Secondary College]] is the largest VCE provider in the state. [[Catherine McAuley College]] follows close after, which ranges from years 7–9 at the Coolock campus and 10–12 at the St Mary's campus. [[Girton Grammar School]], an independent school, provides education to students from years Prep-12. The Bendigo campus of [[La Trobe University]] is also a large and growing educational institution with nearly 5,000 undergraduates and postgraduates.

===Farming and agriculture===
The surrounding area, or "gold country", is quite harsh, rocky land with scrubby regrowth vegetation. The [[box-ironbark forest]] is used for timber (mainly sleepers and firewood) and beekeeping.

Sheep and cattle are grazed in the cleared areas. There are some large poultry and pig farms. Some relatively fertile areas are present along the rivers and creeks, where wheat and other crops such as [[canola]] are grown. The area produces premium wines, including [[Shiraz grape|Shiraz]], from a growing [[viticulture]] industry. [[Salinity]] is a problem in many valleys,<ref>Edwards, M. D., & Webb, J. A.

Bendigo provides services (including a large livestock exchange) to a large agricultural and grazing area on the Murray plains to its north.

===Gold mining===
One of the major revolutions in gold mining (during the Victorian gold rush) came when fields such as Bendigo, but also [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]], [[Ararat, Victoria|Ararat]] and the goldfields close to Mount Alexander, turned out to have large gold deposits below the superficial alluvial deposits that had been (partially) mined out. Gold at Bendigo was found in quartz reef systems, hosted within highly deformed mudstones and sandstones or were washed away into channels of ancient rivers. Tunnels as deep as 900&nbsp;m (3000&nbsp;ft) ([[Stawell, Victoria|Stawell]]) were possible.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VT2FzwEACAAJ |title = Gold, Gems and Pearls in Ceylon and Southern India | first=AMJ | last=Ferguson |date = 27 October 2022 | publisher=London, [[John Haddon & Co]]. | page = 283 |isbn = 978-1-01-679788-7 }} URL: [http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/ferguson-gold-gems-pearls/page_292 Gold, Gems, Pearls Ceylon, Australian Gold Fields Discussion]</ref>

Until overtaken in the 1890s by the Western Australia goldfields, Bendigo was the most productive Australian gold area, with a total production over 622 tonnes (20 million ounces).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Craig |date=2023-04-28 |title=Things to Do In Bendigo In 2023 {{!}} Your Ultimate Guide |url=https://finderhub.com.au/things-to-do-in-bendigo/ |access-date=2023-04-30 |website=Finder Hub |language=en-US}}</ref>

Over the 100-odd year period from 1851 to 1954, the 3,600-hectare area that made up the Bendigo gold field yielded 777 tonnes (25 million ounces) of gold.<ref name="post">{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~DLEStamps/Victoria_EarlyPostalCancelsIllustrated_SectionII_1851to1853.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102071906/http://home.comcast.net/~DLEStamps/Victoria_EarlyPostalCancelsIllustrated_SectionII_1851to1853.pdf |archive-date=2013-11-02|title=State of Victoria Early Postal Cancels (and History) Illustrated, Section II: 1851 to 1853|publisher=Home.comcast.net|access-date=31 March 2015}}</ref>

A large amount of gold remains in the Bendigo goldfields, estimated to be at least as much again as what has been removed. The decline in mining was partly due to the depth of mines and the presence of water in the deep mines.{{cn|date=November 2022}}

=== Transport ===

[[File:A Vline train at Bendigo station .jpg|thumb|A Vline train at [[Bendigo railway station]]]]
Bendigo is connected via the [[Calder Freeway]] to Melbourne, which is fewer than two hours by car.<ref>Google Maps calculates the distance from Bendigo to Melbourne to be {{convert|153|km|0|abbr=on}} and the time of travel is estimated to be 1 hour 47 minutes.</ref> The remaining section of highway nearest Bendigo has been upgraded to dual carriageway standard ensuring that motorists can travel up to speeds of {{convert|110|km/h|0|abbr=on}} for most of the journey. Many other regional centres are also connected to Melbourne via Bendigo, making it a gateway city in the transport of produce and materials from northern Victoria and the Murray to the Port of Melbourne and beyond.

Bendigo acts as a major rail hub for northern Victoria, being at the junction of several lines including the [[Bendigo railway line|Bendigo line]] which runs south to [[Southern Cross railway station|Melbourne]] and lines running north including the [[Yungera railway line|Swan Hill]], [[Deniliquin railway line|Echuca]] and [[Eaglehawk–Inglewood railway line|Eaglehawk–Inglewood]] lines. [[V/Line]] operates regular [[V/Line VLocity|VLocity]] passenger rail services to Melbourne with the shortest peak journeys taking approximately 91 minutes from [[Bendigo railway station]], generally however services take two hours or longer. While there are several rail stations in the urban area, only three other stations currently operated for passengers: [[Kangaroo Flat railway station]] on the Bendigo Line, [[Epsom railway station, Victoria|Epsom Railway Station]] on the Echuca railway line, and [[Eaglehawk railway station]] on the Swan Hill railway line. There are also additional train services to and from [[Swan Hill railway station|Swan Hill]] and [[Echuca railway station|Echuca]]. The [[Regional Rail Revival|Regional rail revival]] project will upgrade the Swan Hill and Echuca lines and build three new stations. On the Echuca line, Huntly station (for the outer suburb of Huntly), Goornong Station (A town in greater Bendigo) and on the Swan Hill line Raywood station (A town in greater Bendigo) All set to open between 2021 and 2022. Residents celebrated the opening of the new Goornong Railway Station at a community event on the weekend of 11–12 December 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Trains arrive to put Goornong back on track for good times|url=http://www.railpage.com.au/news/s/trains-arrive-to-put-goornong-back-on-track-for-good-times|access-date=2021-12-15|website=Railpage}}</ref>

Victoria's electronic ticketing system, [[Myki]], was implemented on rail services between Eaglehawk and Melbourne on 17 July 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Myki to start on VLine Commuter Services|url=http://www.vline.com.au/about/news/mediareleases/96766932/Article.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827131931/http://www.vline.com.au/about/news/mediareleases/96766932/Article.aspx |archive-date=2013-08-27|publisher=VLine Pty Ltd.|access-date=7 August 2013}}</ref>

Bendigo is also served by an extensive bus network that radiates mostly from the CBD with the main terminus at the railway station towards the suburbs. The city is also served by several taxi services.

[[Trams in Bendigo]] have historically operated an extensive network as a form of public transport, but the remains of the network were reduced to a tourist service in 1972.<ref>{{cite web

The second, "Take a Tram", proved more successful, running twice as long as the previous trial. By the end of the "Take a Tram" program, ridership had increased and was increasing. However, due to lack of government subsidy or backing, the program ended.<ref name=results>{{cite web |url=http://www.bendigotramways.com/20_friends/2009_tramtalk_autumn.pdf |title=Tram trial gets mixed results |work=Tram Talk |date=2009 |publisher=Friends of the Bendigo Tramways |access-date=7 July 2010 }}</ref>

Bendigo is served by the [[Bendigo Airport (Australia)|Bendigo Airport]], which is located to the north of the city on the [[Midland Highway (Victoria)|Midland Highway]]. The Bendigo Airport Strategic Plan was approved in 2010 for proposed infrastructure upgrades including runway extension and buildings to facilitate larger planes and the possibility of regular passenger services from major cities in other states. In 2016, Bendigo Airport was upgraded with a new taxiway system, new lighting, and a new 1.6-km north–south runway. On 10 December 2018, [[Qantas]] announced that they would fly between Sydney and Bendigo six times a week, the first of which commenced on 31 March 2019.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091011190714/http://www.bendigo.vic.gov.au/Files/Bendigo_Airport_Strategic_Plan_adopted_3_June_2009.pdf Bendigo Airport Strategic Plan] City of Greater Bendigo June 2009</ref>

=== Health ===
The [[Bendigo Base Hospital]] now known as Bendigo Health is the city's largest hospital, only public hospital, and a major regional hospital. St John of God is the largest private hospital. Bendigo is also served by a privately owned smaller surgical facility, the Bendigo Day Surgery.{{fact|date=January 2023}}

=== Utilities ===
Bendigo is entitled to a portion of the water in [[Lake Eppalock]], an irrigation reservoir on the [[Campaspe River]]. Developments have led to the building of a pipeline from [[Waranga Basin|Waranga]] to Lake Eppalock and thence to Bendigo in 2007. In 1858 Bendigo water works hired [[Joseph Brady (engineer)|Joseph Brady]] as an engineer and he designed nine reservoirs and a channel system called the [[Coliban Water|Coliban main channel]] which provides water from the [[Malmsbury]] reservoir to customers in central Victoria.
