'''Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut''' ({{langx|he|מוֹדִיעִין-מַכַּבִּים-רֵעוּת}} ''Mōdīʿīn-Makkabbīm-Rēʿūt'') is a city located in central Israel, about {{convert|35|km|mi}} southeast of [[Tel Aviv]] and {{convert|30|km|mi}} west of [[Jerusalem]], and is connected to those two cities via [[Route 443 (Israel)|Highway 443]]. In {{Israel populations|Year}} the population was {{Israel populations|Modi'in-makkabbim-re'ut}}.{{Israel populations|reference}} The population density in that year was 1,794 people per square kilometer.

The modern city was named after the ancient Jewish town of [[Modi'in (ancient city)|Modi'in]], which existed in the same area. Modi'in was the place of origin of the [[Maccabees]], the Jewish rebels who freed Judea from the rule of the [[Seleucid Empire]] and established the [[Hasmonean dynasty]], events commemorated by the holiday of [[Hanukkah]]. The modern city was built in the 20th century. A small part of the city (the Maccabim neighborhood) is not recognized by the [[European Union]] as being in Israel, as it lies in what the [[1949 Armistice Agreements#With Jordan|1949 Armistice Agreement with Jordan]] left as a [[no man's land]], and was [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied]] in [[Six-Day War|1967]] by Israel after it was captured from Jordan together with the [[West Bank]] proper.<ref>[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2012/08/15/Israel-blasts-EU-listing/UPI-87411345031817/ 'Israel blasts EU listing,'] [[United Press International|UPI]] 15 August 2012</ref><ref name="Coren" />

==Etymology==
The name "Modi'in" ({{Langx|he|מודיעין}}) derives from the ancient Jewish village "[[Modi'in (ancient city)|Modi'im]]"<ref>The modern Hebrew spelling for ''Modi'in'' follows a reconstruction based on the Greek name Μωδαῒν / Μωδαί (Modin), while overlooking the more ancient spelling of this name found in the [[Mishnah]] (''Pesahim'' 9:2; ''Hagigah'' 3:5), where the name is rendered as Modi'im (מודיעים).</ref> of the high priest [[Mattathias]] and his five sons, which was located in the same area as the modern city. The name "Maccabim" is Hebrew for the [[Maccabees]] and is a common nickname given to Mattathias and his five sons.

==History and archaeology==
===Ancient Modi'in===
[[File:Modiin1870s.jpg|thumb|Three possible locations of historical Modi'in]]{{Main article|Modi'in (ancient city)}}
During classical antiquity, a town named [[Modi'in (ancient city)|Modi'in]] ({{lang-grc-gre|Μωδεειμ}}, ''Mōdeeim'')<ref name="Madaba Map">[[Madaba Map]].</ref> existed in the general area of the modern city. It was the place of origin of the [[Maccabees]], a group of Jewish rebel warriors who started and led the [[Maccabean revolt|Jewish revolt]] against the [[Seleucid]] rule over Judea and the [[Hellenisation]] of its Jewish population. The revolt succeeded in driving out the Selucids, and the rededication of the [[Second Temple]] at the end of the revolt is commemorated by the Jewish holiday of [[Hanukkah]]. After expelling the Selucids, the Maccabees formed the [[Hasmonean dynasty]], which ruled Judea in the 2nd and 1st centuries [[Before Common Era|BCE]].<ref name="silver" /><ref name="roots" />

Under [[Justinian the Great|Justinian]], the Byzantine town in the area was known as Moditha ({{lang|grc|Μωδιθα|Mōditha}}).<ref name="Madaba Map"/>

===Modern city (est. 1985-1996)===
[[File:Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut - Depopulated Palestinian Villages.png|thumb|right|250px|Map of depopulated Palestinian villages within municipal boundaries of Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut]]

The modern city was founded in the late 20th century. The city of Modi'in was built in the 1990s, and it was later merged with the nearby towns of Maccabim and Re'ut, which had been founded in the 1980s, to create the unified municipality of Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut. Modern Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut's municipal boundary encompasses a number of depopulated Palestinian villages: [[Ajanjul]], [[Barfiliya]], [[Bayt Shanna]], [[Bir Ma'in]], [[Al-Burj, Ramle|Al-Burj]], [[Innaba]], [[Khirbat al-Buwayra]], [[Kharruba]], and [[Al-Kunayyisa]].

In 1985, the construction of the town of Maccabim, which was led by the International [[Maccabi (sports)|Maccabi]] organization began, and the project of founding nearby Re'ut, led by an association of Israeli army officers, started in 1987. The towns were united into Maccabim-Re'ut in 1990.

According to [[Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem|ARIJ]], Israel confiscated land from two [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] villages for the construction of Maccabim, presently part of Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut: 1,499 [[dunam]]s from [[Beit Sira]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140907030420/http://vprofile.arij.org/ramallah/pdfs/vprofile/Beit_Sira_vp_en.pdf  Beit Sira Village Profile], ARIJ, p. 17</ref> and 471 dunams from [[Saffa, Ramallah|Saffa]].<ref>[http://vprofile.arij.org/ramallah/pdfs/vprofile/Saffa_vp_en.pdf Saffa village profile], ARIJ, p. 17</ref><ref>Other statistics published by [[ARIJ]] claim that in the wake of the [[Six-Day War|1967 war]], 1680 [[dunam]]s (415 [[acres]]) were confiscated to Israel, of which 840 dunams (207.5 acres) were initially designated for Maccabim settlement, while the remaining lands annexed to Israel without any designation. See: [http://poica.org/2004/07/beit-sira-a-palestinian-village-on-the-verge-of-diminishing/ POICA – Beit Sira: A Palestinian Village on the verge of diminishing], [[Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem]]</ref>

The cornerstone of Modi'in was laid in 1993. It was built as a modern [[planned city]] with high standards of urban planning. Environmental issues and future growth were taken into consideration from the early design stages. Large [[Open space reserve|greenspace]]s were incorporated into the city's layout and comprise 50% of the area within the city limits. The city was opened for residency in 1996.

In 2003, the Israeli Interior Ministry unified Modi'in and Maccabim-Reut into a single city.

==Demography==
[[File:Modi'in 02006.JPG|thumb|180px|High-rise development in Modi'in]]
Modi'in has become a magnet for [[Jerusalem]] residents displeased with the capital's growing [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] character.<ref name="haaretz.com">{{cite magazine |url= http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/was-building-city-of-modi-in-a-mistake-1.249671 |title= Was building the city of Modi'in a mistake? - Business |magazine= haaretz.com}}</ref> Thousands of residents of [[Rosh HaAyin]], [[Lod]], and [[Ramla]] have also relocated to Modi'in.<ref name="haaretz.com"/> In 2008, it was decided to cap the growth of Modi'in to allow for the development of Lod and Ramla.<ref name="haaretz.com"/> The city was planned by the well-known architect [[Moshe Safdie]]. According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, the city is rated at level 8 out of 10 on the scale of socio-economic development, with a high proportion of high school graduation, 76.5% (2006–07), and an average monthly income of 9,659 [[Israeli new shekel|NIS]], compared to a national average of 7,466 (2006). Modi'in has attracted a large community of [[olim]] (Jewish immigrants) from English-speaking countries.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4077093,00.html |title= A gilded landsmanschaft - Israel Jewish Scene, Ynetnews |newspaper= Ynetnews |publisher= Ynetnews.com |date=1995-06-20 |access-date=2011-09-16|last1= Fischer |first1= Elli }}</ref>

==Controversy==
In 2012, the European Union reclassified the small part of Modi'in originally founded as the community of Maccabim as a [[Israeli settlements|West Bank settlement]] since it had been established in the [[No man's land (Latrun)|no man's land]] according to the [[1949 Armistice Agreements|1949 Armistice agreements]]. The effect of this redefinition was to deny the affected area (which is exclusively green-leaf residential) a range of preferential tax benefits that would normally be conceded on Israeli products exported to Europe.<ref name="Coren">Ora Coren,  [http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/european-union-parts-of-modi-in-do-not-belong-to-israel-1.458222 'European Union: Parts of Modi'in Do Not Belong to Israel'], [[Haaretz]], 14  August 2012</ref> The decision was made to implement a 2010 ruling of the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]].<ref name="Coren" /> The move sparked a diplomatic controversy.

==City plan==
[[File:Modnall021.jpg|thumb|right|Azrieli Mall in central Modi'in]]
[[File:Parkannabe001.jpg|thumb|right|Wadi Anaba Park west of the city center]]
The original city of Modi'in is laid out around a central hub, with the main arterial spokes organized as [[dual carriageway]]s. Each side of the artery is a one-way street, and in between is a wide [[Greenway (landscape)|green space]], with [[linear park]]s, playgrounds, schools, and some small commercial centers. Short lateral stubs fed by [[continuous-flow intersection]] turn lanes allow drivers to traverse the green spaces and effect a U-turn onto the artery's opposite direction lanes. These stubs also serve as the entranceways for the schools and mini-malls, preventing parking traffic from blocking the high-speed, left lanes of the arteries. The right shoulders of most arteries do, however, allow parking, except in the pullouts for bus stops, next to fire hydrants, etc.

The city center is a large [[traffic circle]] punctuated by [[traffic light]]s. On the north side of the circle is the [[Modi'in Central Railway Station|central train station]], to the northeast is the Azrieli [[shopping mall]] (pictured), and to the west and south is the Anaba park (also pictured), which contains a small <!-- DON'T wikilink --> artificial lake <!-- redirects to "reservoir," and this is NOT a reservoir --> used for recreational [[boating]]. The traffic circle straddles a major northeast–southwest artery, HaHashmona'im Blvd., that connects to the southwest with [[Route 431 (Israel)|route 431]] (which has its eastern terminus in south Modi'in and extends west to [[Rishon LeZion]]), and to the northeast with [[Route 443 (Israel)|route 443]] (at Shilat Junction) providing connectivity to [[Jerusalem]] (southeast) and [[Lod]] (northwest).

Approximately {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=in}} west-northwest of the city center is an industrial zone, and to the west (on route 431) is the Yishpro commercial center. The latter is also accessible via an additional Modi'in train station, [[Paatei Modi'in Railway Station|Paatei Modi'in]] ({{langx|he|פאתי מודיעין}}, "Modi'in outskirts"). The industrial zone is also linked to route 443 via its own interchange, between Shilat Junction and the Maccabim Junction at the eastern side of the Ben Shemen [[Jewish National Fund|JNF]] forest. This keeps most of the commercial traffic out of the city proper, so that the two arteries between the city and its industrial zone (Emek HaEla and HaShdera Hamerkazit) carry primarily commuters rather than trucks.

The long-term projection of the Ministry of Housing is for the city to be home to 240,000 residents. However, plans approved thus far are for 120,000 residents.

==Neighborhoods==
[[File:Modiin Map 2011.png|thumb|Neighborhoods of Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut]]
[[File:Parkmodi.JPG|thumb|Park Modi'in]]

השבטים ''HaShvatim'' – The Tribes (North Buchman/Buchman) and מוריה ''Moriah'' (South Buchman) are the most southern neighborhoods in the city. Most of the buildings in this neighborhood are ground-level private homes and condos. The streets of Shvatim are named after the [[The Twelve Tribes|tribes of Israel]], and the streets of Moriah are named after ancient historical Jewish figures. Moriah, the name of the southern neighborhood, is also a feminine name representing these women.

הפרחים ''HaPrachim'' – The Flowers (Miromi) is a small neighborhood in the city center. Located in HaPrachim is a commercial center, two primary schools and a secondary school. The neighborhood's streets are named after trees, flowers, and plants. At the northern part of the neighborhood there is a small compound where the streets are named after phrases from the [[Song of Songs]].

הנחלים ''HaNechalim'' – The Rivers (Safdie) and משואה ''Masuah'' – Beacon (Givat C) are located towards the west of the city, and were planned by architect [[Moshe Safdie]]. Located in these neighborhoods are five commercial centers, a secondary school and three primary schools. The central street names are named after valleys in Israel, and the side streets are named after Israeli rivers and streets. The name "Masuah" was selected in order to represent the neighborhood's high altitude. Within the area consisting of the streets named after rivers and streams is the "Malibu" area, which, as with other areas, is colloquially named after the contractor who designed the neighborhood.

הכרמים ''HaKramim'' – The Vineyards (Tsipor) is the northernmost neighborhood in Modi'in.  The streets are named after the Hebrew months. The name "Kramim" is in honor of the vineyards that were located where the neighborhood now stands before the city was founded.

אבני חן ''Avnei Chen'' – Precious Stones (Kaizer) is located towards the west of the city, and parts of it are still under construction. The main road is named "Avnei Choshen" and leads to the only retail under residential mixed use buildings in Modi'in.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Other streets, in keeping with the neighborhood's name, are named for precious stones. The parks are connected through the center of the neighborhood and allow pedestrians to cross. A bike lane in the Emek Zvuloon street leads to the center of town.

הנביאים ''HaNevi'im'' – The Prophets (Northern Shimshoni) and המגינים ''HaMeginim'' – The Defenders (Southern Shimshoni) are located towards the northwest of the city. Streets in HaNevi'im are named for the [[Prophets in Judaism|Prophets of Israel]], while HaMeginim's streets are named after [[general]]s and important battles in Israeli history. Located in the neighborhoods are three commercial centers, three primary schools, and one secondary school.

הציפורים ''HaTsiporim'' – The Birds (South Kaizer) is still being planned. Its streets will be named after different species of birds, and will be a relatively small neighborhood consisting of only seven streets.

==Culture and sports==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 8234 clture auditorium in modiin.jpg|thumb|right|Modi'in cultural auditorium]]

In 2007, Modi'in was selected as one of the inaugural cities for the [[Israel Baseball League]]. The baseball team was named the [[Modi'in Miracle]], but did not play games in Modi'in as there is no baseball stadium there.

In 2008, the Pioneers of the [[Israeli Football League]] (American Football) relocated to Modi'in. The Pioneers played all their home games in Modi'in. In their first year, the Modi'in "Dancing Camel" Pioneers won the IFL Championship. After an unsuccessful 2009–10 season, their second in Modi'in, the Pioneers relocated once again to Tel Aviv, where most of the team's players lived.

==Transportation==
[[File:ModBahn006.jpg|thumb|right|View towards Modi'in Central Railway Station and main commercial district]]
Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut is accessible by [[Route 431 (Israel)|Road 431]], [[Highway 3 (Israel)|Highway 3]] and [[Route 443 (Israel)|Road 443]]. An [[Israel Railways]] line began operation on April 1, 2008, to a [[Modi'in Central Railway Station|large underground station in Modi'in]]. Service began in September 2007 to [[Paatei Modi'in Railway Station|Paatei Modi'in]] on the western outskirts of the city. This railway connects Modi'in to [[Tel Aviv]] by way of [[Ben Gurion Airport]]. The line to Modi'in is a spur off the [[high-speed railway to Jerusalem]], currently due for completion in 2016. Once this line is completed, Modi'in will be within 30 minutes' ride of Jerusalem. Intercity and local bus services are provided by [[Kavim]].
