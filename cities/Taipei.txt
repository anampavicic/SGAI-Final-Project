Due to the ambiguous [[political status of Taiwan]] internationally, the term ''[[Chinese Taipei]]'' is also frequently used as a [[synonym]] for the entire country, as when Taiwan's governmental representatives participate in [[international organizations]] or when Taiwan's athletes compete in international sporting events, including the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]].

In the late 19th century, the Taipei area, where the major Han Chinese settlements in northern Taiwan and one of the designated overseas trade ports, [[Tamsui District|Tamsui]], were located, gained economic importance due to the booming overseas trade, especially that of [[tea]] export. In 1875, the northern part of Taiwan was separated from [[Taiwan Prefecture]] and incorporated into the new [[Taipeh Prefecture]] as a new administrative entity of the Qing dynasty.<ref name="marsh1">{{cite book |last=Marsh |first=Robert |title=The Great Transformation |publisher=M.

In 1885, as work commenced to govern the island as a province, Taipeh was thus temporarily designated as a provincial capital.

As settlement for losing the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], China ceded the [[island of Taiwan]] to the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1895 as part of the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]]. After the Japanese takeover, Taipei, romanized into English as '''Taihoku''' following the Japanese language pronunciation, was retained as the capital. It subsequently emerged as the political center of the Japanese Colonial Government.<ref name="marsh1" /> During that time the city acquired the characteristics of an administrative center, including many new public buildings and [[Qidong Street Japanese Houses|housing for civil servants]]. Much of the architecture of Taipei dates from the period of [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], including the [[Presidential Office Building (Republic of China)|Presidential Office Building]] which was the Office of the [[Governor-General of Taiwan]].

During Japanese rule, Taihoku was incorporated in 1920 as part of [[Taihoku Prefecture]]. It included [[Wanhua District|Bangka]], [[Twatutia]], and {{nihongo||城內|Jōnai}} among other small settlements. The eastern village of {{nihongo4||松山庄|Matsuyama|modern-day [[Songshan District, Taipei]]}} was annexed into Taihoku City in 1938. Taihoku and surrounding areas were bombed by Allied forces on several occasions. The largest of these Allied air raids, the [[Taihoku Air Raid]], took place on 31 May 1945.

Upon the Japanese defeat following the nuclear bomb destruction of [[Hiroshima]] and its consequent surrender in August 1945, the [[Kuomintang]] (Chinese Nationalist Party) [[Retrocession Day|assumed control]] of Taiwan. Subsequently, Taipei was established as a [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|provincial city]] and a temporary Office of the [[Taiwan Province]] Administrative Governor was established in it.{{sfnp|Marsh|1996|p=85}} In 1947 the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government under [[Chiang Kai-shek]] declared island-wide [[martial law in Taiwan]] as a result of the [[28 February Incident]], which began with incidents in Taipei but led to an island-wide crackdown on the local population by forces loyal to Chiang. Two years later, on 7 December 1949, Chiang and the Kuomintang forces were forced to flee mainland China after the defeat by Communist revolutionaries.

The city's population, which had reached one million in the early 1960s, also expanded rapidly after 1967, exceeding two million by the mid-1970s. Although growth within the city itself gradually slowed thereafter{{sfnp|Marsh|1996|p=85}} — its population had become relatively stable by the mid-1990s – Taipei remained one of the world's most densely populated urban areas, and the population continued to increase in the region surrounding the city, notably along the corridor between Taipei and [[Keelung]].{{Original research inline|date=March 2023}}

===Air quality===
In comparison to other [[Asia]]n cities, Taipei has "excellent" capabilities for managing [[air quality]] in the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/news/13786.html |title=Pollution is a major threat for Asian cities, says new report |publisher=EarthTimes |date=14 December 2006 |access-date=22 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918040929/http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/news/13786.html |archive-date=18 September 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Its rainy climate, location near the coast, and strong environmental regulations have prevented air pollution from becoming a substantial health issue, at least compared to cities in southeast Asia and industrial China. However, smog is extremely common and there is poor visibility throughout the city after rainless days.

Motor vehicle engine exhaust, particularly from motor scooters, is a source of [[air pollution]] in Taipei. There are higher levels of fine [[particulate]] matter and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s in the mornings because of less air movement; sunlight reduces some pollution.<ref>{{cite news |last=Oung |first=Angelica |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/05/04/2003359365 |title=Taipei air pollution alarming: scientists |newspaper=[[The Taipei Times]] |date=4 May 2007 |access-date=27 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705014955/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/05/04/2003359365 |archive-date=5 July 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>

While Taipei City is home to 2,524,393 people (2022), the greater [[Taipei–Keelung metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] has a population of 7,047,559 people.<ref name="population" /> Even though the population of the city has been decreasing in recent years, the population of adjacent [[New Taipei]] has been increasing. The population loss, while rapid in its early years, was slowed by lower density development and campaigns designed to increase the birthrate in the city in the 2010s. As a result, the population rose 2010–2015.<ref name="population" /><ref name="demographics">{{cite web |url=http://english.taipei.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1084529&ctNode=29491&mp=100002 |title=Demographical Overview |date=28 July 2009 |publisher=Taipei City Government |access-date=11 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715113135/http://english.taipei.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1084529&ctNode=29491&mp=100002 |archive-date=15 July 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=1193132&lang=eng_news&cate_img=logo_taiwan&cate_rss=TAIWAN_eng |title=Premier agrees to suspend sales of state-owned prime city land |publisher=Central News Agency |date=2 March 2010 |access-date=11 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916060723/http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=1193132&lang=eng_news&cate_img=logo_taiwan&cate_rss=TAIWAN_eng |archive-date=16 September 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Due to Taipei's geography and location in the [[Taipei Basin]] as well as  differing times of settlement and differing degrees of economic development of its districts, Taipei's population is not evenly distributed. The districts of [[Daan District, Taipei City|Daan]], [[Songshan District, Taipei|Songshan]], and [[Datong District, Taipei|Datong]] are the most densely populated. These districts, along with adjacent communities such as [[Yonghe District|Yonghe]] and [[Zhonghe District|Zhonghe]], contain some of the most densely populated neighborhoods in the world.<ref name="demographics" />

In 2008, the [[birth rate|crude birth rate]] stood at 7.88%, while the [[mortality rate]] stood at 5.94%. A decreasing and rapidly aging population is an important issue for the city.<ref name="demographics" /> By the end of 2009, one in ten people in Taipei was over 65 years of age.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=1163105&lang=eng_news |title=Taiwan's elderly population reaches one in 10: interior ministry |publisher=[[Central News Agency (Taiwan)|Central News Agency]] |date=23 January 2010 |access-date=11 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201201320/http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=1163105&lang=eng_news |archive-date=1 December 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Residents who had obtained a college education or higher accounted for 43.48% of the population, and the literacy rate stood at 99.18%.<ref name="demographics" />

Like the rest of Taiwan, Taipei is composed of four major ethnic subgroups: [[Hoklo people|Hoklos]], [[Waishengren]], [[Hakka people|Hakkas]], and [[Taiwanese aborigines|aborigines]].<ref name="demographics" /> Although Hoklos and [[Waishengren]] form the majority of the population of the city, in recent decades many Hakkas have moved into the city. The aboriginal population in the city stands at 16,713 at the end of 2018 (<1%), concentrated mostly in the suburban districts. Foreigners (mainly from [[Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Japan]]) numbered 71,858 at the end of 2022.<ref name="demographics" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5475/5478/141478/141380/331536/cp_news |title=2022.11Foreign Residents by Nationality |website=immigration.gov.tw |access-date=26 January 2023 |archive-date=26 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230126152809/https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5475/5478/141478/141380/331536/cp_news |url-status=live}}</ref>

Taipei City is a [[Special municipality of Taiwan|special municipality]] which is directly under the [[Executive Yuan]] ([[Central Government]]). The [[Mayor of Taipei|mayor of Taipei City]] was an appointed position since Taipei's conversion to a centrally administered municipality in 1967 until the first public election was held in 1994.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kwok |first=R. Yin-Wang |title=Globalizing Taipei |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |page=201 |isbn=0-415-35451-X}}</ref> The position has a four-year term and is elected by direct popular vote.  The first elected mayor was [[Chen Shui-bian]] of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]]. [[Ma Ying-jeou]] took office in 1998 for two terms, before handing it over to [[Hau Lung-pin]] who won the 2006 mayoral election on 9 December 2006.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E0DE1431F933A25751C1A9609C8B63 |title=Taiwan Leader's Party Wins in Mayoral Vote, but Recount Is Sought |newspaper=The New York Times |date=10 December 2006 |access-date=14 July 2009 |first=Keith |last=Bradsher |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307103659/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E0DE1431F933A25751C1A9609C8B63 |archive-date=7 March 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Both Chen Shui-bian and Ma Ying-Jeou went on to become [[President of the Republic of China]].

===Garbage recycling===
Taipei City strongly promotes garbage recycling, with such success that other countries have sent teams to study the recycling system. After the [[Environmental Protection Administration (Republic of China)|Environmental Protection Administration]] (EPA) established a program in 1998 combining the efforts of communities, a financial resource named the Recycling Fund was made available to recycling companies and waste collectors. The EPA also introduced garbage recycling trucks, in effort to raise community recycling awareness, that broadcast classical music (specifically Beethoven's "Für Elise" and Tekla Bądarzewska-Baranowska's "A Maiden's Prayer") to announce its arrival to the community.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/09/taiwan-garbage-trucks-music_n_1195020.html |title=Taiwan Garbage Trucks: Classical Music Accompanies Collection (VIDEO) |date=9 January 2012 |work=Huffington Post |access-date=8 June 2018 |language=en-US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005113810/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/09/taiwan-garbage-trucks-music_n_1195020.html |archive-date=5 October 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> Manufacturers, vendors and importers of recyclable waste pay fees to the Fund, which uses the money to set firm prices for recyclables and subsidize local recycling efforts. Between 1998 and 2008, the recycling rate increased from 6 percent to 32 percent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=93434&ctNode=1337&mp=1 |title=Recycling: Taiwan's Way of Life |publisher=Taiwan Review |date=1 March 2010 |access-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206120553/http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=93434&CtNode=1337&mp=1 |archive-date=6 December 2010}}</ref> This improvement enabled the government of Taipei to demonstrate its recycling system to the world at the [[Expo 2010|Shanghai World Expo 2010]].

===Administrative divisions===
Taipei City is divided up into 12 administrative [[District (ROC)|districts]] ({{zh|labels=no |t=區 |p=qū}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.taipei.gov.tw/np.asp?ctNode=27185&mp=100002 |title=Administrative Districts |publisher=Taipei City Government |access-date=11 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715110737/http://english.taipei.gov.tw/np.asp?ctNode=27185&mp=100002 |archive-date=15 July 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> Each district is further divided up into [[Village (Taiwan)|urban villages]] ({{lang|zh|里}}), which are further sub-divided up into neighborhoods ({{lang|zh|鄰}}).

===City planning===
The city is characterized by straight roads and public buildings of grand Western architectural styles.<ref name="jones">{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Ian |title=City Museums and City Development |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=2008 |page=102 |isbn=978-0-7591-1180-6}}</ref> The city is built on a square grid configuration; however, these blocks are huge by international standards with {{cvt|500|m|2|abbr=on}} sides. The area in between these blocks is infilled with lanes and alleys, which provide access to quieter residential or mixed-use development. Other than a citywide {{cvt|30|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} speed limit, there is little uniform planning within this "hidden" area; therefore, lanes (perpendicular to streets) and alleys (parallel with streets, or, conceptually, perpendicular to lanes) spill out from the main [[controlled-access highway]]s. These minor roads are not always perpendicular and sometimes cut through the block diagonally.

Although development began in the western districts of the city (still considered the cultural heart of Taipei) due to trade, the eastern districts have become the focus of recent development projects. Many of the western districts have become targets of [[urban renewal]] initiatives.<ref name="jones" />

==Transportation==

===Metro===
{{Main|Taipei Metro|Taoyuan Airport MRT}}
Taipei's public transport system, the [[Taipei Metro]] (commonly referred to as the MRT), incorporates a [[rapid transit|metro]] and [[light rail]] system based on advanced [[Véhicule Automatique Léger|VAL]] and [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]] technology. There are currently six metro lines that are organized and labeled in three ways: by color, line number and depot station name. In addition to the rapid transit system itself, the Taipei Metro also includes several public facilities such as the [[Maokong Gondola]], underground shopping malls, parks, and public squares. Modifications to existing [[Taiwan Railways Administration|railway]] lines to integrate them into the metro system are underway.

In 2017 [[Taoyuan Airport MRT|a rapid transit line]] was opened to connect Taipei with [[Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport]] and [[Zhongli District]]. The new line is part of the new [[Taoyuan Metro]] system.

On 31 January 2020, Hitachi Rail Corporation officially commissioned Phase 1 of the [[Circular line (New Taipei Metro)|Circular line]] which took place at [[Shisizhang station]]. The Circular line is a 15.4&nbsp;km driverless rail system. The Circular line offered free rides beginning in February 2020 for passengers to test the route.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://railway-news.com/hitachi-rail-taipei-metro-circular-line/ |title=Hitachi Rail Commissions Phase 1 of Taipei Metro Circular Line |date=2020-02-03 |website=Railway-News |access-date=2020-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200301052706/https://railway-news.com/hitachi-rail-taipei-metro-circular-line/ |archive-date=1 March 2020 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202002250014 |title=Free rides on MRT Circular Line to end Saturday - Focus Taiwan |website=focustaiwan.tw |language=zh-Hant-TW |access-date=2020-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200303022214/https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202002250014 |archive-date=3 March 2020 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Bus===
{{Main|Taipei Joint Bus System}}
An extensive [[Taipei bus|city bus system]] serves metropolitan areas not covered by the metro, with exclusive bus lanes to facilitate transportation.<ref name="tpctoday" /> Riders of the city metro system are able to use the EasyCard for discounted fares on buses, and vice versa. A unique feature of the Taipei bus system is the joint venture of private transportation companies that operate the system's routes while sharing the fare system. This route is in sharp contrast to bus systems in the U.S. which are mostly public entities. Several major intercity bus terminals are located throughout the city, including the [[Taipei Bus Station]] and [[Taipei City Hall Bus Station]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/05/24/2003473719/print |title=Traffic chaos expected in Xinyi |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=24 May 2010 |access-date=11 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201204445/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/05/24/2003473719/print |archive-date=1 December 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Ticketing===
In 1994, following the rapid development of Taipei, a white paper for transport policies expressed the strong objective of creating a transport system for the people of Taipei to accommodate the burgeoning city's needs. In 1999, they chose Mitac consortium, which Thales-Transportation Systems is part of. [[Thales Group|Thales]] was then selected again in 2005 to deploy an upgrade of Taipei's public transport network with an end-to-end and fully contactless automatic fare collection solution that integrates 116 metro stations, 5,000 buses and 92 car parks.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[National Taiwan University]] (NTU or ''Tai-Da'') was established in 1928 during the period of Japanese colonial rule. NTU has produced many political and social leaders in Taiwan. Both [[pan-blue coalition|pan-blue]] and [[pan-green coalition|pan-green]] movements in Taiwan are rooted on the NTU campus. The university has six campuses in the greater Taipei region (including [[New Taipei]]) and two additional campuses in [[Nantou County]]. The university governs farms, forests, and hospitals for educational and research purposes. The main campus is in Taipei's Da-An district, where most department buildings and all the administrative buildings are located. The College of Law and the College of Medicine are located near the [[Presidential Office Building (Republic of China)|Presidential Office Building]]. The [[National Taiwan University Hospital]] is a leading international center of medical research.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/about+ntu/location/ntumap.htm |title=National Taiwan University – About NTU |date=6 August 2007 |access-date=27 July 2009}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

[[National Taiwan Normal University]] (NTNU or ''Shi-Da'') likewise traces its origins to the Japanese colonial period. Founded as Taihoku College in 1922 and organized as a teacher training institution by the Kuomintang in 1946, NTNU has since developed into a comprehensive international university. The university boasts especially strong programs in the humanities and international education. Worldwide it is perhaps best known as home of the [[Mandarin Training Center]], a program that offers [[Mandarin language]] training each year to over a thousand students from scores of countries throughout the world.  The main campus, in Taipei's Daan district near MRT Guting Station, is known for its historic architecture. The Shida market area surrounding this campus takes its name from the school's acronym.
