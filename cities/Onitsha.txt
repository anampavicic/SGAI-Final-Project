The indigenous people of Onitsha are [[Igbo people|Igbo]] and speak the [[Igbo language]] with Onitsha being the largest urban area and commercial hub of the [[Igboland]] region of Nigeria, the Igbo people’s indigenous homeland. The Onitsha people are referred to as Ndi Onicha in Igbo. [[English language|English]] and [[Nigerian Pidgin|Nigerian Pidgin English]] are also widely spoken. Although the population is largely Igbo, there are many other ethnic groups in the Onitsha area mainly from other Nigerian ethnicities indigenous to the southeast of the country due to Onitshas position as an economic hub in the region.

According to Africapolis,<ref>{{Cite book |title=OCDE/CSAO (2020), Africa's Urbanisation Dynamics 2020 : Africapolis, Mapping a New Urban Geography, West African Studies, Éditions OCDE, Paris |date=2020 |doi=10.1787/b6bccb81-en |isbn=978-92-64-57958-3 |url=https://doi.org/10.1787/b6bccb81-en |access-date=2024-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title= Africapolis |url=https://africapolis.org/en/explore?agglomeration=Onitsha&country=Nigeria&poprange=1,2,3,4,5,6&year=2020 |access-date=2024-02-23}}</ref> the greater Onitsha metropolis will be regarded as one of the most densely populated areas in the world by 2050.

== Modern history ==
[[File: Niger bridge.jpg|top|left|thumb|Niger Bridge.]]

Onitsha slowly grew to become an important trading port for the [[Royal Niger Company]] in the mid-1850s following the abolition of slavery and with the development of the steam engine when [[Europeans]] were able to move into the hinterland<ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-07-25 |title=Bridges and the cost of democracy |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/07/bridges-cost-democracy/ }}</ref>.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Onitsha Tourism (2024) Nigeria - Best Places to Visit in Onitsha, Onitsha Travel Reviews and Images |url=https://www.hellotravel.com/nigeria/onitsha |access-date=2024-06-16 |website=HelloTravel}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=2014-07-25 |title=Bridges and the cost of democracy |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/07/bridges-cost-democracy/ }}</ref>

Trade in [[palm kernel]]s, [[palm oil]], and other cash crops on the coast of the [[Bight of Biafra]] increased around this river port in the 19th century.

In 1857 [[British Empire|British]] [[palm oil]] traders established a permanent station in the city with Christian missionaries joining them.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gospel on the Banks of the Niger: Journals and Notices of the Native Missionaries Accompanying the Niger Expedition of 1857–1859 |first=Crowther & |last=Taylor |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |orig-date=1859 |isbn=978-1-108-01184-6}}.</ref>

In 1900 Onitsha became part of a British [[protectorate]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Southern Nigeria in Transition 1885–1906 |first=J. C. |last=Anene |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1966 |pages=212–213}}</ref> The British colonial government and Christian [[missionaries]] penetrated most of [[Igboland]] to set up their administration, schools and churches through the river port at Onitsha.

In 1965, the [[River Niger Bridge (Onitsha)|Niger River Bridge]] was built across the [[Niger River]] to replace the ferry crossing. This has helped to grow trade routes with western Nigeria and created significant economic linkages between Onitsha and [[Benin City]] and Lagos particularly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2018/12/30/with-new-funding-second-niger-bridge-offers-hope-of-economic-revolution/|title=With New Funding, Second Niger Bridge Offers Hope of Economic Revolution|website=The Business Year|date=30 December 2018|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hometown.ng/listing-item/onitsha/|title=Onitsha {{!}} Hometown.ng™|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>

The [[Nigeria Civil War|Nigerian-Biafran war]] brought devastation to Onitsha as the city was a major theatre of war for forces entering [[Biafra]] from the western front. The subsequent oil boom years of the 1970s and early 1980s witnessed a huge influx of immigrants into the city. The result has been hastily constructed and haphazard building which has created a huge number of slums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://onitshacitymarathon.com/aboutonitsha.html|title=About Onitsha|website=onitshacitymarathon.com|access-date=2020-01-22}}{{Dead link|date=June 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Festival===
Once a year in October the kingdom of Onitsha holds the [[Ofala Festival]] which coincides with the traditional [[New Yam festival]] held in many parts of [[Igboland]]. The Ofala Festival in ancient times offered the people the opportunity to see the king and receive blessings from him. Nowadays, it is a way for the people of Onitsha to keep their culture alive, take stock of the communal activities and it has become a major event that draws visitors from far and wide to the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Obi of Onitsha Commends Glo for Supporting Ofala Festival - THISDAYLIVE |url=https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2019/10/13/obi-of-onitsha-commends-glo-for-supporting-ofala-festival |access-date=2023-06-10 |website=www.thisdaylive.com |language=en}}</ref>

== Geography ==

Onitsha lies on the eastern flank of a major east–west crossing point of the [[Niger River]] across from the [[Asaba|city of Asaba, Delta]] and occupies the northernmost point of the river regularly navigable by large vessels. It is the western terminus of the central ''Anambra hills''. These factors have historically and in modern-day made Onitsha into major trading center between the coastal regions and the north, as well as between eastern and western Nigeria. Onitsha possesses one of the very few road bridge crossings of the mile-wide Niger River<ref>{{cite news |title=The second Niger Bridge |newspaper=The Daily Sun |date=2007-02-20 |url=http://www.sunnewsonline.com/webpages/opinion/editorial/2007/feb/20/editorial-20-02-2007-001.htm |access-date=2007-04-06}}</ref><ref name=britannica>{{cite web |title=Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/429251/Onitsha |access-date=2008-10-02}}</ref> and plans are in place to add a [[Second Niger bridge|second bridge]] southwards of the existing one.

Rapid urbanization in recent years although promoting the economy, negatively affects natural vegetation and local landscape.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Nwaogu|first1=Chukwudi|last2=Okeke|first2=Onyedikachi J.|last3=Fadipe|first3=Olusola O.|last4=Bashiru|first4=Kehinde A.|last5=Pechanec|first5=Vilém|date=2017|title=Is Nigeria losing its natural vegetation and landscape?

== Climate ==
Onitsha has two main seasons: a warm, oppressive, and overcast wet (''rainy'') season from March to October, and a hot and partly cloudy dry season from November to February with both largely influenced by the SW and NE [[trade winds]] of the Atlantic [[Intertropical Convergence Zone|International Convergence Zone (''ITCZ'')]]. [[Harmattan|Saharan harmattan winds]] are experienced during the winter months, causing [[haze]] and poor visibility with [[Thunderstorm|thunderstorms]] common in March/April as well as in late September/October. Over the duration of the year, the temperature commonly varies from 19&nbsp;°C (67&nbsp;°)F to 31&nbsp;°C (88&nbsp;°F) and is rarely below 15&nbsp;°C (59&nbsp;°F) or above 33&nbsp;°C (92&nbsp;°F).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Climate and Average Weather Year Round in Onitsha Nigeria |url=https://weatherspark.com/y/52941/Average-Weather-in-Onitsha-Nigeria-Year-Round}}</ref> The [[Köppen climate classification]] is ''[[Köppen climate classification|Aw]]''. 

== Urbanization ==
In the early 1960s, before the [[Nigerian Civil War]] (see also [[Biafra]]), the population was officially recorded as 76,000, and the town was distinctive in a number of dimensions; the great Nigerian writer [[Chinua Achebe]] (born and raised in the contiguous town of [[Ogidi, Anambra State|Ogidi]]) characterized it as harboring an "esoteric region from which creativity sallies forth at will to manifest itself,"  "a zone of occult instability" (see [http://www.amightytree.org "Onitsha Matters"]).

Indeed, Onitsha has played a creative role in the transformation to urban life in Eastern Nigeria famous as the setting for [[Onitsha Market Literature]] and as one of the hubs for the financing and distribution of [[Nollywood]] films.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Madichie|first1=Nnamdi|last2=Nkamnebe|first2=Anayo|date=2010-11-01|title=51 Iweka Road (Onitsha, Nigeria): Could this single African address redefine business cluster development?|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227441280|journal=World Review of Entrepreneurship, Management and Sustainable Development|volume=6|issue=3|pages=229–243|doi=10.1504/WREMSD.2010.036677}}</ref>

However, infrastructure has not kept pace with urbanization and haphazard building practices without zoning regulations has left in its wake a chaotic and congested city rife with lawlessness. The [[World Health Organization]] Global Urban Ambient [[Air Pollution]] database's 2016 update indicates that Onitsha is the most polluted city in Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://datadriven.yale.edu/2016/06/06/a-new-air-pollution-database-is-good-but-imperfect/|title=A New Air Pollution Database Is Good, but Imperfect {{!}} Data-Driven Yale|website=datadriven.yale.edu|access-date=2016-11-25|archive-date=2016-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126064843/http://datadriven.yale.edu/2016/06/06/a-new-air-pollution-database-is-good-but-imperfect/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://undark.org/article/air-pollution-lagos/|title=Amid Staggering Pollution, Nigerians Struggle to Catch Their Breath|last=Cunningham|first=Anna|date=October 22, 2018|website=Undark|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref>

In recent times with the encroachment of neighboring communities, the Onitsha people have been involved in disputes over land ownership in the surrounding area with the people of Obosi and Nkwelle Ezunaka.<ref>Vincent Ujumadu (June 17, 2013).

[[File: Harbor Layout Onitsha.jpg|thumb|Harbor Industrial Layout of Onitsha]]

In 2012 the state government, through a joint venture, attracted [[SAB Miller]] to invest in [[Intafact Beverages Limited|Onitsha Brewery]], which started production in August. It was the first large-scale investment in Onitsha since Premier Breweries, makers of the Premier Beer established production in Onitsha in the early part of the 1980s. In January it was announced that upgrades to the value of $110 million would triple the output of beer and malt drinks.<ref name="Business Day">{{cite web |url=http://businessdayonline.com/2014/01/sab-miller-investing-110-m-to-triple-onitsha-brewery-capacity/ |title=SAB Miller investing $110 m to triple Onitsha brewery capacity |access-date=28 February 2014 |archive-date=7 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307121807/http://businessdayonline.com/2014/01/sab-miller-investing-110-m-to-triple-onitsha-brewery-capacity/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Transport==
Onitsha is not only accessible by rivers and land, but also by air. The city has an international cargo and [[Anambra International Cargo Airport|passenger airport]] located at [[Umueri]].

== Religion and politics ==
Onitsha is a predominantly [[Christian]] city. People from Northern and Western Nigeria also practice Islam. In February 2006, armed militants killed at least 80 ethnic [[Hausa–Fulani|Hausa Fulani]] (Muslims) and burned a few Muslim sites, including two mosques.<ref name=aljazeera1>{{Cite news |title=Scores killed in Nigeria riots |work=Al Jazeera |date=2006-02-23 }}</ref><ref name=aljazeera2>{{Cite news |title=Toll rises in Nigeria sectarian riots |work=Al Jazeera |date=2006-02-24 }}</ref><ref name=washingtonpost>{{Cite news |title=Nigerian Christians Burn Corpses |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=2006-02-24 |last=Timberg |first=Craig |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/23/AR2006022300647.html |access-date=2007-04-06 |pages=A10 }}</ref> The riots were in response to riots by [[Muslims]] in the city of [[Maiduguri]] days earlier, where at least 18 Christians were killed, sparked by the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|cartoon controversy]] in [[Denmark]].

==In Popular Culture==

===Onitsha Market Literature===
{{main | Onitsha Market Literature}}
It refers to the 20th century genre of sentimental, moralistic novellas, pamphlets and other publications sold at the [[Main Market, Onitsha|Onitsha Market]] in Nigeria in the 1950s and 1960s. Much of it was written in pidgin English.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Onitsha-market-literature | title=Onitsha market literature &#124; Igbo culture, oral tradition, satire &#124; Britannica }}</ref> The Onitsha writings have two distinct characteristics: a fascination with westernized urban life and the desire to warn the newly arrived against the corruption and dangers that accompany it. Typical titles are “Rose Only Loved My Money,” “Drunkards Believe Bar as Heaven,” “Why Some Rich Men Have No Trust in Some Girls,” and “How to Get a Lady in Love.” Sentimental novelettes, political tracts, and “how to” guides on writing love letters, handling money, and attaining prosperity all have achieved great commercial success, and booksellers hawk these cheap, locally produced pamphlets (which are printed on handpresses) at Onitsha.

== Environment==
The amount of waste generation is attributed to the city's high population being a [[commercial area]] that draws in people from within and outside Nigeria for business purposes. They generate mostly [[food waste]], [[polythene bag]]s, [[paper]] and its related wastes and [[metal]]. Others are pieces of  [[clothes]], [[plastic]], [[Tin can|tins]], [[bottle]]s  and  [[Glass (material)|glass materials]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Nwachukwu M.
