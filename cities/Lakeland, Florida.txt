'''Lakeland''' is a city in [[Polk County, Florida]], United States. Located along [[Interstate 4|I-4]] east of [[Tampa]] and west of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], it is the [[List of municipalities in Florida|most populous city]] in Polk County. As of the 2020 [[U.S. Census Bureau]] release, the city had a population of 112,641.<ref name="USCensus2020">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/lakelandcityflorida|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|access-date=May 21, 2020}}</ref> Lakeland is a principal city of the [[Lakeland–Winter Haven metropolitan area|Lakeland–Winter Haven Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Lakeland is situated among several lakes including Lake Morton downtown and is sometimes locally referred to by the nickname "Swan City" due to its sizeable population of swans, all of whom are descendants of two mute swans given to Lakeland by Queen Elizabeth II in 1957. Lakeland is home to several colleges and universities. [[Lakeland Linder International Airport]] is in Lakeland as is the [[corporate headquarters]] of [[Publix]], a supermarket chain.

European-American settlers arrived in Lakeland from Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina in the 1870s. The city expanded in the 1880s with the arrival of rail service, with the first [[freedmen]] railway workers settling here in 1883.<ref name="monument">[http://www.theledger.com/news/20180505/confederate-vets-former-slaves-form-lakelands-history Kimberly C. Moore, "Confederate vets, former slaves form Lakeland’s history"], ''The Ledger'', 09 May 2018; accessed 27 June 2018</ref> They and European immigrants also came because of land development opportunities with farming, citrus, cattle and [[phosphate]] industry developing.

===Early history===
[[File:Lakeland fl.jpg|thumb|right|Lakeland's business district, early 1920s]]
[[File:Lakeland Cox School01.jpg|thumb|The John F. Cox Grammar School opened in 1925, now re-purposed as the clinic for Lakeland Volunteers in Medicine]]

In the 18th century Native Americans groups, collectively called "[[Seminole]]s", moved into the areas left vacant. In 1823, the United States and the various tribes in Florida signed the [[Treaty of Moultrie Creek]], which created a reservation in central Florida that included what is now Polk County.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mahon|first=John K.|title=History of the Second Seminole War 1835–1842|year=1985|publisher=University of Florida Press|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=0-8130-1097-7|edition=Revised|pages=2–8, 18–37}}</ref> Starting in 1832, the United States government tried to move the Seminoles in Florida west to the [[Indian Territory]]. Most of the Seminoles resisted, resulting in the [[Second Seminole War]], 1835–1842. By the end of that war, most of the Seminoles had been sent west, with a few remnants pushed well south of what is now Polk County.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mahon|first=John K.|title=History of the Second Seminole War 1835–1842|year=1985|publisher=University of Florida Press|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=0-8130-1097-7|edition=Revised|pages=317–318}}</ref>

===Statehood and the 19th century===
Florida became a state in 1845, and Polk County was established in 1861. After the [[American Civil War]], the county seat was established southeast of Lakeland in [[Bartow, Florida|Bartow]]. While most of Polk County's early history centered on the two cities of Bartow and [[Fort Meade, Florida|Fort Meade]], eventually, people entered the areas in northern Polk County and began settling in the areas which became Lakeland.<ref name="Brown-2001">{{Cite book|last=Brown|first=Canter Jr.|title=In the midst of all that makes life worth living : Polk County, Florida, to 1940|publisher=Sentry Press|year=2001|isbn=9781889574127|location=Tallahassee, Fla.|language=English}}</ref>

Lakeland was first settled in the 1870s, and began to develop as the [[railroad|rail lines]] reached the area in 1884. [[Freedmen]] settled here in 1883, starting development of what became the [[African-American neighborhood]] of Moorehead. Lakeland was incorporated January 1, 1885. The town was founded by [[Abraham Munn]] (a resident of [[Louisville, Kentucky]]), who purchased {{convert|80|acre|m2|abbr=on}} of land in what is now downtown Lakeland in 1882 and [[plat]]ted the land for the town in 1884. Lakeland was named for the many lakes near the town site.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FLROAAAAIBAJ&pg=1418%2C2813009 | title=Polk towns named from various sources | work=Lakeland Ledger | date=July 8, 1987 | access-date=June 6, 2015 | author=Sawyer, Martha F. | pages=5C}}</ref>

In April 1898, the [[Spanish–American War]] began and started a crucial point in Lakeland's development. While the war ended quickly and had little effect on most of the nation, the Florida peninsula was used as a launching point for military forces in the war. The then small town of Lakeland housed over 9,000 troops. The [[10th Cavalry Regiment]], one of the original [[Buffalo Soldier]] regiments, were housed on the banks of Lake Wire.<ref name="Spanish American War">{{cite web| url=http://www.polkcountyhistory.org/pdf/june03.pdf| page=6| title=Spanish American War| date=June 2003| access-date=September 26, 2010|work=Polk County Historical Quarterly|volume=30|issue=1|publisher=Polk County Historical Association|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402101638/http://www.polkcountyhistory.org/pdf/june03.pdf|archive-date=April 2, 2012}}</ref> Soon after being stationed there, the black troops faced conflict with the local white population. In one event, a local druggist refused to sell to black soldiers and an argument ensued which eventually escalated to the point where the druggist brandished a pistol. The soldiers shot the druggist before he could fire, which resulted in two of the troops being arrested.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Knetsch |first1=Joe |title=Florida in the Spanish-American War |date=2011 |publisher=The History Press |location=Charleston, SC |isbn=9781609490881 |pages=131–132}}</ref>

===The Florida Boom and the 20th century===
[[File:Florida - Lakeland - NARA - 23936679 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|View of Lakeland, April 1922]]
[[File:Florida - Lakeland - NARA - 23936675 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Factory under construction, August 1941]]
The Florida boom resulted in the construction of many significant structures in Lakeland, a number of which are now listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. This list includes the Terrace Hotel, New Florida Hotel (Regency Tower, currently Lake Mirror Tower), [[Polk Theatre and Office Building|Polk Theatre]], [[Frances Langford Promenade]], [[Polk Museum of Art]] (not a product of the 1920s boom), Park Trammell Building (formerly the [[Lakeland Public Library]] and today the Lakeland Chamber of Commerce), and others. The city also has several historic districts that have many large buildings built during the 1920s and 1940s. The [[Cleveland Indians]] held spring training there from 1923 to 1927 at [[Henley Field Ball Park]]. Parks were developed surrounding Lake Mirror, including Barnett Children's Park, Hollis Gardens, and the newest, Allen Kryger Park.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Lake Mirror Complex|url=https://www.lakelandgov.net/departments/parks-recreation/lake-mirror-complex/|access-date=2021-10-29|website=City of Lakeland|language=en}}</ref>

The "boom" period went "bust" quickly, and years passed before the city recovered. Part of the reemergence was due to the arrival of the [[Detroit Tigers]] baseball team in 1934 for spring training. The Tigers still train at Lakeland's [[Joker Marchant Stadium]] and own the city's [[Minor League Baseball|Class A]] [[Florida State League]] team, the [[Lakeland Flying Tigers]].

===World War II===
At the beginning of [[World War II]], the Lakeland School of [[Aeronautics]]—headquartered at the recently built [[Lakeland Municipal Airport]]—became part of a nationwide network of civilian [[flight school]]s enjoined for the war effort by the [[United States Army Air Corps]].<ref name="LEDGER" />

===Lakes===
[[File:Lakeland FLAUSA lake Mirror.jpg|thumb|right|Lake Mirror Park in downtown Lakeland, with surrounding City Hall and Lakeland Terrace Hotel]]
The dominant feature in Lakeland is the city's many lakes. Thirty-eight lakes are named, with a number of other bodies of water unnamed, mostly phosphate mine pits that eventually filled with water.<ref>{{cite web|title=Measurement of Recovery in Lakes Following Phosphate Mining|url=http://www1.fipr.state.fl.us/fipr/fipr1.nsf/129fc2ac92d337ca85256c5b00481502/9a9af43eaa9607f885256b2f0051be61/$FILE/03-045-039Final.pdf|publisher=Florida Institute of Phosphate Research|access-date=February 4, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222004307/http://www1.fipr.state.fl.us/fipr/fipr1.nsf/129fc2ac92d337ca85256c5b00481502/9a9af43eaa9607f885256b2f0051be61/$FILE/03-045-039Final.pdf|archive-date=February 22, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.lakelandgov.net/libraryspecialcollections/SpecialCollectionsHome/FrequentlyAskedQuestions.aspx|publisher=Lakeland, Florida|access-date=February 4, 2014}}</ref> The largest of these is [[Lake Parker, Florida|Lake Parker]], which is {{convert|2550|acre|km2|abbr=on}} in size. Much of the culture of Lakeland revolves around its many lakes, and many people use the lakes as reference points in much the same way people in other towns use streets as reference points, such as "I live near Lake Beulah." In addition to Lake Parker, some of the more prominent lakes in the Lakeland area are [[Lake Hollingsworth]], [[Lake Morton (Florida)|Lake Morton]], Lake Mirror, and [[Lake Gibson (Florida)|Lake Gibson]].

[[Swan]]s are one of the most visible features on the lakes near downtown Lakeland. They have a long history, the first swans appearing around 1923. By 1954, the swans were gone, eradicated by [[alligator]]s and pets. A Lakeland resident who mourned the passing of the swans wrote to [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. The [[royal family]] allowed the capture of two of the royal swans, and the swans now on the lakes of Lakeland are the descendants of the one surviving royal swan sent by the Queen.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Story Map Journal|url=https://lakelandflorida.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=7fb4f159b1d34663834098c1e940458a|access-date=2021-10-29|website=lakelandflorida.maps.arcgis.com}}</ref>

===Climate===
Lakeland, like most other parts of Florida north of [[Lake Okeechobee]], is in the [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] zone ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Cfa''). Typically, summers are hot and humid with high temperatures seldom dropping below 90&nbsp;°F and 70&nbsp;°F for the overnight low. Like most of Central Florida, afternoon thunderstorms are the norm throughout the summer. Winters in Lakeland are drier and warm, with frequent sunny skies. High temperatures range in the mid 70s during the day, with lows in the 50s. Cold snaps drop temperatures below freezing twice a year on average.

[[File:Publix Corporate Headquarters Main Entrance Sign, Lakeland Florida.jpg|thumb|[[Publix]] headquarters]]
Lakeland is the largest city on Interstate 4 between Orlando and Tampa. Large industries in the Lakeland area are citrus, cattle, and [[phosphate mining]]. In the past few decades, tourism, medicine, insurance, transportation, and music have grown in importance.

Citrus growing dates back to the early settlers who planted trees in the area, in the 1850s. After a series of freezes in counties north of Polk County, the area became the focal point for citrus growing in Florida. Although citrus is no longer the largest industry in the area, it still plays a large part in the economy of Lakeland and Polk County.

Phosphate mining is still important to the economy of Lakeland, although most of the mining now takes place farther south. The [[Bone Valley]] produced 25% of the U.S. phosphate supply.

Lakeland's largest employer is [[Publix Super Markets]].<ref name="Lakeland Demographics Guide 2010">{{cite web

==Culture==
The Lakeland History Room is a special collections archive established in 1987 housed within the [[Lakeland Public Library]]'s main branch. The Lakeland History Room maintains the City's collection of historical materials as well as other locally relevant collections composed of documents, photographs, maps, building plans, audio/visual media, scrapbooks, specialty items like citrus crate labels, artwork, yearbooks, posters, and postcards.<ref name="City of Lakeland">{{Cite web|title=Lakeland History Room|url=https://www.lakelandgov.net/departments/library/lakeland-history-room/|access-date=2021-11-29|website=City of Lakeland|language=en}}</ref> The LHR maintains a large digital collection with over 7,000 images of the city of Lakeland, its landmarks, significant historical moments, cultural institutions, and prominent citizens.<ref name="City of Lakeland" /> The LHR provides one-on-one assistance with historic research, a history lecture series with prominent local historians, a DIY Digitizing Lab for personal material preservation, and genealogical programs and resources.<ref name="City of Lakeland" />

In 2019, an initiative led by Lakeland City Commissioner Phillip Walker, was first presented to the City Commission to create the City's first History and Culture Center. The project was unanimously approved by the Commission and funds were allocated for the project's construction; although, the exhibit's content design would be funded by local donations and grant funding.<ref name="City of Lakeland-2">{{Cite web|title=Lakeland History & Culture Center|url=https://www.lakelandgov.net/departments/library/lakeland-history-culture-center/|access-date=2021-11-29|website=City of Lakeland|language=en}}</ref> An advisory committee made up of educators, city officials, local business owners, and civic and community leaders, led by former Mayor [[Gow Fields]], was established to organize and advise the City in the design, content, and construction of the exhibit.<ref name="City of Lakeland-2" /> The [[Lakeland Public Library]] was eventually chosen as the location of the future exhibit space due to its central location within the city, its status as a community hub, and because it was the current home of the city's local archive, the Lakeland History Room, which would be expanded into the Lakeland History and Culture Center. Construction on the project is currently underway and it is unknown when the project will be completed.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}

==Government and politics==
[[Image:Lakeland Munn Park Hist Dist Old City Hall03.jpg|thumb|right|Former Lakeland city hall, built 1913]]
Lakeland is governed by a six-member city council. Four members are elected from [[single-member district]]s; the other two are elected [[at-large]], requiring them to gain a majority of the votes. The mayor is elected.

===Mayor===
The City of Lakeland was incorporated on January 1, 1885. The mayor is one of seven members of the City Commission, acting as the board chair and performing mostly ceremonial and procedural duties beyond the powers of the other six. Prior to 1988, the City Commission selected Lakeland's mayor from among its members. Mayors can be on the board for up to 12 years in a lifetime, or 16 years in combination with holding a regular commission position. Lakeland's first mayor was J.W. Trammell.

The first female mayor was Lois Q. Searl, who served in 1965.
The 1970 municipal election placed the first African-American on the City Commission, Dr. [[John S. Jackson (Florida politician)|John S. Jackson]].<ref>{{Cite news|first= Garth|last=Germond |authorlink=   |title= Jackson Wins Runoff for City Commission Post  |newspaper=[[The Tampa Tribune  ]]|date= November 27, 1968|url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-tampa-tribune/135396400/ |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>  In 1972, he became the first black mayor for the city.
In 1980, [[Carrie R. Oldham]] became Lakeland's first African-American female mayor.

Since 1988, the mayor has been elected by the city's voters.

===Law enforcement===
On September 28, 2006, Polk County Sheriff's Deputy Vernon "Matt" Williams and his K-9 partner Diogi were shot and killed after a routine traffic stop in the Wabash area of Lakeland. More than 500 police officers from a variety of law enforcement agencies joined in a search for Angilo Freeland, suspected of murdering Williams and stealing his gun. Freeland was found hiding in a rural area the next morning. Nine officers from five different law enforcement agencies surrounded Freeland and shot him when he raised Williams' stolen gun at them. A total of 110 shots were fired, and Freeland was hit 68 times, killing him instantly.<ref name="Waddell">{{cite magazine | last = Waddell | first = Lynn | title = 68 Bullets | magazine = Newsweek | date = October 13, 2006 | url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2006/10/13/68-bullets.html}}</ref><ref name="autopsy">{{cite web | title = Autopsy: Officers fired 110 rounds at man suspected in cop's death | publisher = Sunbeam Television Corp. | date = September 30, 2006 | url = http://www1.wsvn.com/news/articles/local/MI30139/ | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131113120847/http://www1.wsvn.com/news/articles/local/MI30139/ | archive-date = November 13, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Multiple investigations concluded the officers' use of force was justified.<ref>{{cite web | last = Walter | first = Shoshana | title = Killer's Civil Rights Not Violated, Panel Says | publisher = TheLedger.com | date = June 5, 2008 | url = http://www.theledger.com/article/20080605/NEWS/806050510?p=1&tc=pg&tc=ar}}</ref> Deputy Williams and Diogi were laid to rest on October 3, 2006, after a funeral that included a one-hour-and-45-minute procession to [[Auburndale, Florida|Auburndale]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Stegall | first = Sarah | title = Thousands Turn Out to Say 'Thank You' | publisher = TheLedger.com | date = October 4, 2006 | url = http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061004/NEWS26/610040399}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
Because Lakeland is the largest city on [[Interstate 4|I-4]] between Tampa and Orlando, the city is an important transportation hub. The county nickname, Imperial Polk County, was coined because a large bond issue in 1914 enabled wide roads between the cities of Polk County.<ref name="Why Iperial Polk">{{cite web

The important freeways and highways in Lakeland today are:
* {{jct|state=FL|I|4}} is the main interstate in Central Florida linking Tampa, Lakeland, Orlando, and Daytona Beach.
* {{jct|state=FL|Toll|570}} (or Polk Parkway), is a tolled beltway around Lakeland, with both ends terminating at I-4. Although its shape, location, and tolls makes it impractical as a "bypass" road, it is useful as a way of getting from part of town to another and providing access to I-4 from most parts of the city.
* {{jct|state=FL|US|92}}, following Memorial Boulevard for most of the city, was the route leading to both Tampa and Orlando before I-4 was built; US 92 is still a main road leading to Plant City going west, and Auburndale, Winter Haven, and Haines City going east.
* {{jct|state=FL|US|98}}, going south, follows Bartow Road and leads to Bartow, the county seat. Heading north out of town, it provides a route to [[Dade City, Florida|Dade City]].
* {{jct|state=FL|FL|33}}, following mostly rural land, provides access to [[Lake County, Florida|Lake County]] and the [[Florida’s Turnpike]].
* {{jct|state=FL|FL|37}}, following Florida Avenue, the main north–south route in Lakeland, is also the main road leading south to [[Mulberry, Florida|Mulberry]].
* {{jct|state=FL|FL|540}}, Winter-Lake Road, is in southern Lakeland, leading to Winter Haven and [[Legoland Florida]].

====Bicycle routes====
In recent years, the Lakeland area has developed a number of paved, multi-use bicycle routes including the [[Lake-To-Lakes Trail]], which runs from [[Lake Parker (Florida)|Lake Parker]] through downtown, past several lakes, ending at Lake John. Other routes include University Trail, which connects [[Polk State College]] to Florida Polytechnic University, and the [[Fort Fraser Trail]], which runs along US Highway 98 from Polk State College to Highway 60 in [[Bartow, Florida|Bartow]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Trails and Facilities|url=http://www.lakelandgov.net/bicycling/trails-facilities|access-date=April 5, 2016}}</ref>
