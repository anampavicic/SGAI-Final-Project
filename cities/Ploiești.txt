Part of the historical region of [[Muntenia]], it is located {{cvt|56|km}} north of [[Bucharest]].

The area of Ploiești is around {{cvt|60|km2}}, and it borders the [[Blejoi]] commune in the north, [[Bărcănești, Prahova|Bărcănești]] and [[Brazi]] communes in the south, [[Târgșoru Vechi]] commune in the west, and [[Bucov]] and [[Berceni, Prahova|Berceni]] communes in the east. According to the [[2021 Romanian census|2021 census]], Ploiești is the [[List of cities and towns in Romania|tenth most populous city]] in the country with a population of 180,540.<ref name="RPL2021"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-26058967-harta-interactiva-populatia-romaniei-fiecare-localitate-din-tara-recensamantul-2021-2011-cele-mai-mari-creseri-cele-mai-drastice-scaderi.htm|title=Populația României în fiecare localitate din țară – Recensământul 2021 vs. 2011|trans-title=Romania's population for each city in the country – 2021 vs. 2011 Censuses|publisher=Hotnews.ro|language=ro|date=2 February 2023}}</ref>

The city grew beginning with the 17th century on an estate bought by ruler [[Michael the Brave]] from the local landlords, gradually replacing nearby Wallachian fairs of [[Târgșor]], [[Gherghița]], and Bucov. Its development was accelerated by heavy industrialisation during the mid-19th century, with the world's first large-scale [[oil refinery|petroleum refinery]] being opened between 1856 and 1857. Following massive exploitation of the oil deposits in the area, Ploiești earned the nickname of "the Capital of Black Gold". In the present, a significant part of its economic activity is still based on oil processing, the city having three large refineries and other industries related to this branch.

Ploiești is also an important [[transport hub]], linking the capital with the regions of [[Transylvania]] and [[Moldavia]]. The city has direct access to [[Prahova Valley]], one of the most important alpine tourism areas in Romania.

Though likely settled much earlier,{{original research inline|date=July 2019}} Ploiești first appeared in documents in the 16th century during the reign of [[Michael the Brave]], the Prince of [[Wallachia]] ({{reign|1593|1601}}). It flourished as a center for trade and handicraft-manufacturing in the 17th and 18th centuries. The road connecting Ploiești to [[Brașov]] was opened in 1864, and the railway arrived in 1882. Many schools and hospitals date from this period.

In the mid-19th century, the region of Ploiești became one of the world's leading [[petroleum|oil]]-extraction and [[oil refinery|-refinery]] sites. The Mehedințeanu brothers opened the [[Oil refinery#History|world's first large refinery]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/eakins/we_1844.htm |title=WORLD EVENTS: 1844–1856 |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].org |access-date=2009-04-22 |quote="world's first oil refinery" |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705142847/http://www.pbs.org/eakins/we_1844.htm |archive-date=2017-07-05 |url-status=live}}</ref> in Ploiești in 1856–1857. History also remembers the city as the site of the self-styled [[Republic of Ploiești]], a short-lived 1870 revolt against the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian monarchy]].

During [[World War I]], Ploiești's oil production made it a target when the [[Central Powers]] [[Romanian Campaign (1916)|invaded Romania in 1916]], a [[British Army]] operation commanded by [[Sir John Norton-Griffiths, 1st Baronet|Colonel John Griffiths]] destroying production and sabotaging much of the infrastructure of the industry.<ref>

Although badly damaged after the [[1940 Vrancea earthquake|November 1940 earthquake]], the city functioned as a significant{{ref|1|1}} source of oil for [[Nazi Germany]] during much of [[World War II]]. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] made Ploiești a target of the [[oil campaign of World War II]] and [[Aerial bombing during World War II|bombed]] it repeatedly,<ref>{{cite video |year=1943 |title=Video: American Bombers Smash Axis Oil Fields In Romania Etc.

such as during the [[HALPRO]] (Halverson Project, June 1942) and [[Operation Tidal Wave]] (1 August 1943) at a great loss, without producing any significant delay in operation or production. Soviet [[Red Army]] troops [[Battle of Romania (1944)|captured Ploiești]] on 24 August 1944.

Following the war, the new [[Communist Romania|Communist]] régime of Romania [[nationalization|nationalised]] the [[oil industry]], which had largely been privately owned, and made massive investments in the oil- and petroleum-industry in a bid to modernise the country and to repair the war damage.

The population of Ploiești went from 56,460, as indicated by the December 1912 census, up to 252,715 in January 1992. However, since the [[Romanian Revolution|fall of Communism]], the city's population continues to gently fall due to both emigration and a declining birth rate.

===Historical trends===
The population of Ploiești grew at a rapid pace because of the intense economic development of the area. In 1810, during the years of the Ottoman occupation, there were only around 2,024 inhabitants in the present-day city. In 1837 this grew to 3,000 inhabitants, 11 years after the Union in 1859 the population was 26,458, while in 1884 the number stood at 32,000. During the early 20th century, the population of Ploiești grew even more, due to the expansion of the petrol industry. Even though the city was bombed during World War II, the population of Ploiești recovered, numbering 95,632 inhabitants in January 1948.

[[File:Ploiesti (9).jpg|thumb|upright|The City hall, formerly the headquarters of [[Petrom]], a Romanian oil company and the largest corporation in the country]]

After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Ploiești experienced rapid economic loss. The city is situated at just {{cvt|60|km|0}} north of [[Bucharest]], with promising infrastructure projects currently underway. It is a strong industrial center, focused especially on the oil production and refining industry. Although oil production in the region is declining steadily, there is still a thriving processing industry with four operating [[oil refining|oil refineries]], linked by [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]]s to [[Bucharest]], the [[Black Sea]] port of [[Constanța]] and the [[Danube]] port of [[Giurgiu]]. Ploiești also has a long history as a textile manufacturing center.

The city has become a hub of foreign investment. Companies such as [[OMV]]-[[Petrom]], [[Lukoil]], [[Shell Gas]], [[Timken Company|Timken]], [[Yazaki]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Efes Pilsener]], [[British American Tobacco]], [[Federal-Mogul]], and [[Interbrew]] have operations there, and retailers like [[Carrefour]], [[Metro Cash and Carry|Metro]], [[Selgros]], [[Kaufland]], [[Billa (supermarket)|Billa]], [[Bricostore]], [[Lidl]], [[Obi (store)|Obi]], [[Auchan]], [[Profi]], and [[Mega Image]] have found in Ploiești a continuously growing market, but the pay rate for employees is lower than expected. There are four [[McDonald's]] restaurants in Ploiești and three [[KFC]]s.

The German retailer [[Tengelmann (retailer)|Tengelmann]] built a depot in Ploiești to support a €200&nbsp;million regional expansion plan. With its Interex ([[:ro:Interex|ro]]) operation, the French independent retailer [[Intermarché]] intends to become a distribution leader in the Balkans. In Romania the first Interex store was opened in June 2002 in Ploiești. The Interex depot and facilities were bought by [[Penny Market XXL]] in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Adevarul.ro |title=Penny Market XXL, pe locul fostului magazin Interex Ploiești |url=http://adevarul.ro/locale/ploiesti/hypermarket-penny-market-xxl-locul-fostului-magazin-interex-ploiesti-1_530a24a9c7b855ff569890f0/index.html |access-date=2014-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408221339/http://adevarul.ro/locale/ploiesti/hypermarket-penny-market-xxl-locul-fostului-magazin-interex-ploiesti-1_530a24a9c7b855ff569890f0/index.html |archive-date=2014-04-08 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Unilever]] has a detergent plant in Ploiești. By transferring their food production to Ploiești, the company will concentrate all its activities in Romania at the same location. At the beginning of March 2006, [[Unilever]] announced they would invest money to build one production center in Romania, and the construction of the new food plant is part of this plan.<ref>[[Bucharest Business Week]], [http://www.bbw.ro/articol_47261/unilever_builds_factory_in_ploiesti.html Unilever builds factory in Ploiești] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110021134/http://www.bbw.ro/articol_47261/unilever_builds_factory_in_ploiesti.html |date=2009-01-10 }}, March 10, 2006</ref>

In 1950, as a milestone in the development of the petroleum, [[hydrocarbon|hydrocarbon processing]], and [[petrochemical|petrochemical industries]], the Engineering and Design Institute for [[oil refinery|Oil Refineries]] and [[petrochemical|Petrochemical Plants]], [[IPIP SA|SC IPIP SA]], a Romanian company with a large range of capabilities and experience, was established at Ploiești.

In Ploiești there are four local television channels: Ploiești TV, Valea Prahovei TV, Wyll TV and Prahova TV.

===Landscape and flora===

The city lies on the [[Wallachian Plain]], having an average altitude of {{cvt|150|m}}. The surrounding landscape is influenced by its position around the Prahova River, whose stream bed lies {{cvt|25|km}} to the west. The [[Teleajen|Teleajen River]] passes through the city while the [[Dâmbu (river)|Dâmbu River]] passes through the north-eastern neighbourhoods.

The vegetation of Ploiești used to be characterised by a plain forest, made up predominantly of pedunculate oak trees (''[[Quercus robur]]''). Other varieties of oak trees such as the sessile oak (''[[Quercus petraea]]'') also existed. Remnants of the old forest still exist and some trees are currently protected, such as two old oak trees in [[Bărcănești, Prahova|Ghighiu]], on the southern periphery of the city.

In current times the vegetation is typical of urban settlements, made up of ornamental plants, plantations of [[chestnut]]s, [[Populus tremula|aspen]] and [[black locust]]. Parks and other green areas are limited: the main boulevard area, the park next to the Sala Sporturilor, the park from the northern part of the city, the "Mihai Viteazul" park and another park next to the Bucov barrier. These occupy only around {{cvt|85.5|ha}}, resulting in {{cvt|3.2|m2}} of green space per inhabitant.
[[File:Arteziana-ceas-1.jpg|thumb|Central park]]

Around the city one can also observe several endangered trees, which are protected by law. These include the giant redwood (''[[Sequoiadendron giganteum]]'') from the garden of the "Paul Constantinescu" museum. There also exist trees that have adapted to the local climate, such as [[Common fig|figs]]. In some neighbourhoods more fruit trees and flowers are currently being planted.
