'''Uruguaiana''' is a [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in the [[Brazil]]ian state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. It is located on the eastern shore of the [[Uruguay River]]
bordering [[Argentina]]. Opposite to Uruguaiana, and joined to it by a [[Paso de los Libres–Uruguaiana International Bridge|road/railway bridge]], lies the Argentine city of [[Paso de los Libres]], [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]]. North of Uruguaiana lies the [[Brazil]]ian municipality of [[Itaqui]], connected by a bridge constructed by the British in 1888 over the [[Ibicuí River]]. The municipality also borders the municipalities of Alegrete, Barra do Quaraí and Quaraí, and, also, [[Uruguay]], making it one of the few international triple-border municipalities of Brazil.

The city marks the southernmost point reached by the [[Paraguay]]ans in the [[Paraguayan War]]; after being taken without resistance, it was recaptured after a six-week [[siege]] that effectively ended the phase of Paraguayan offensive operations.<ref>Leuchars, Chris. ''To the Bitter End: Paraguay and the War of the Triple Alliance'' (2002), chapter ten.</ref>

Nowadays, Uruguaiana represents the biggest in population and arguably{{unbalanced opinion|date=December 2022}} most important municipality of the sparsely populated western Rio Grande do Sul.
