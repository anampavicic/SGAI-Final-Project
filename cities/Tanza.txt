==History==
{{Expand section|date=December 2019}}

[[File:Bantayog ng Kasaysayan, Tanza, Cavite, July 2023.jpg|thumb|Historical Marker]]

Tanza was formerly a strip of land incorporated for official purpose to the municipality of [[General Trias|San Francisco de Malabon]], now called General Trias. The first settlers were the Fabian brothers who migrated here. This place was particularly devoted to grazing and was called Estancia (1780).

In the mid-19th century, the Secularization movement that was largely centered in Santa Cruz de Malabón led by [[Pedro Pelaez]].

On October 15, 1903, the [[Taft Commission|Philippine Commission]] approved Act No. 947, annexing Santa Cruz de Malabon to the adjacent town of San Francisco de Malabon.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=947|title=An Act Reducing the Twenty-Three Municipalities of the Province of Cavite to Eleven|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%20947|date=October 15, 1903|accessdate=June 17, 2023}}</ref> In 1909, a resolution was passed by the San Francisco de Malabon municipal council to reconvert Santa Cruz de Malabon into a separate and independent municipality; it took effect in 1910.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tanza.gov.ph/history|title=History|website=Tanza|accessdate=June 17, 2023}}</ref>

In 1914, Florentino Joya, the then-representative of [[Cavite]] to the [[Philippine Assembly]], worked for the passage of a bill which renamed the town of Santa Cruz de Malabon to Tanza by virtue of Philippine Legislative Act No. 2390 dated February 28, 1914.<ref>{{cite PH act|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l8afa|chamber=Act|number=2390|title=An Act Changing the names of the municipalities of Santo Niño and Mawanan, Province of Cagayan; San Isidro Labrador and San Isidro de Potot, Province of Pangasinan; San Francisco de Malabon and Santa Cruz de Malabon, Province of Cavite; Nagpartian and San Miguel, Province of Ilocos Norte; Langaran, Province of Misamis; San Pedro Tunasan, Province of Laguna; Cabagan Nuevo, Province of Isabela; Nueva Caceres, Province of Ambos Camarines; San Pedro Macati, Province of Rizal; San Juan de Bocboc, Province of Batangas; San Juan, Province of Nueva Ecija; township of Barrit - Luluno, Province of Ilocos Sur, and of the Barrios of Tublijon and Gibigaan, Municipality of Sorsogon, Province of Sorsogon.|date=February 28, 1914|access-date=July 18, 2022}}</ref>
