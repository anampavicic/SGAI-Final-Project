== Administration ==
The region of Western Greece was established in the 1987 administrative reform.<ref>Π.Δ. 51/87 ''«Καθορισμός των Περιφερειών της Χώρας για το σχεδιασμό, προγραμματισμό και συντονισμό της Περιφερειακής Ανάπτυξης»'', (Official Government Gazette of Greece, no. 26A'/06-03-1987)</ref> With the 2010 [[Kallikratis plan]], its powers and authority were redefined and extended. Along with [[Peloponnese (region)|Peloponnese]] and the [[Ionian Islands (region)|Ionian Islands]] regions, it is supervised by the Decentralized Administration of Peloponnese, Western Greece and the Ionian Islands based at [[Patras]]. The region is based at [[Patras]] and is divided into three [[regional units of Greece|regional units]] (pre-Kallikratis [[prefectures of Greece|prefectures]]), [[Aetolia-Acarnania]] in Central Greece and [[Achaea]] and [[Elis (regional unit)|Elis]] in Peloponnese, which are further subdivided into 19 [[Municipalities of Greece|municipalities]].

== Climate ==
The region has hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters, typical of a [[Mediterranean climate]] (Csa). Sunny days dominate during the summer months in areas within the beaches and partially cloudy and rainy in the mountains. Snow is very common during the winter in the mountains of [[Mount Erymanthos|Erymanthus]], [[Panachaiko]] and [[Aroania (mountain)|Aroania]]. Winter average temperatures are around the 10&nbsp;°C mark throughout the low-lying areas.

== Economy ==
The [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 8.3 billion € in 2018, accounting for 4.5% of Greek economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €15,200  or 50% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 65% of the EU average.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|website=Eurostat}}</ref>
