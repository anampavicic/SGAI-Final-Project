'''Cadiz''', officially the '''City of Cadiz''' ({{langx|hil|Dakbanwa/Syudad sang Cadiz}}; {{langx|ceb|Dakbayan sa Cadiz}}; {{langx|fil|Lungsod ng Cadiz}}), is a 2nd class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Negros Occidental]], [[Philippines]]. It was the capital of the short-lived province of [[Negros del Norte]], before the creation of the province was declared unconstitutional on August 18, 1986.

According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 158,544 people.{{PH census|current}}

The city is a gateway and a premier center of agro-fishery resources in Negros Island. The strategic location of the city, with a wide and rich island and marine resources and vast fertile agricultural land, and the completion of the commercial port and the construction of a fish port, will open a new opportunity for economic growth and competitiveness.

The city is a major sugarcane-producing area. This is transported to [[Victorias City]] for further refining. Another major source of livelihood is the harvest of [[seafood]].

The Dinagsa Festival, a celebration which earned Cadiz the name of the Dinagsa Country of the north, is held annually on the last week of January. Some three kilometers off the coast of Barangay Cadiz Viejo is a white sand island resort of [[Lakawon]], a popular destination among the local population.

The current City Mayor is Salvador G. Escalante Jr. (elected 2019).

The city was heavily damaged by [[Typhoon Haiyan]], but has had success with restoration efforts to a stage where conditions are comparable to its pre-calamity status.

==History==
Cadiz traces its beginnings to the establishment of a traditional settlement in a place known as Cadiz Viejo, near the banks of the Hitalon River. Historical records showed that in 1861, the Spaniards came and named the settlement Cadiz because of its northern location which reminded them of the seaport by the same name in Spain.

Cadiz became a municipality independent from Saravia (now E.B. Magalona) in 1878. Its first appointed Gobernadorcillo was Antonio Cabahug, married to Capitana Francisca Cito. During the outbreak of the [[Philippine Revolution]] saw Cadiz take part in the insurrection in 1898. As her sons and daughters, headed by Francisco Abelarde, took up arms against their Spanish masters.

During the short-lived government of the cantonal state of the [[Republic of Negros|Federal Republica de Negros]], Jose Lopez Vito was elected its president. At the onset of American rule, Cadiz was on its way to prosperity with the operation of two lumber companies in the area. The war years stopped these economic activities and brought much suffering to the people of Cadiz. The resistance movement and the local forces of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] units put up the civil government in the mountains to deal with civilian affairs. In the post-war election of 1952, Joaquin Ledesma was elected mayor. Cadiz is also known as the "City of Whales" in 1960 because a number of whales washed to its shores in several different historical events thus became an iconic image of the city.

===Cityhood===
In July 1967, Cadiz was inaugurated as a [[Cities of the Philippines|city]] by virtue of Republic Act No. 4894 which was passed by Congress on June 17, 1967. The act was authored by Congressman Armando Gustilo.

===Super-Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda)===
In November 2013, the city was heavily damaged by the typhoon. Around 20,000 homes were damaged. In the island of Lakawon, from 250 homes, 10 was left standing. No casualties were reported in and around the city.

===Language===
[[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] is the major language of the city, with differences in tone and accent from the Hiligaynon used in [[Metro Bacolod]]. It is also mixed with a few [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words. [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and [[English language|English]] are widely taught but seldom used, however, both are frequently used in the academe and businesses.

==Economy==
{{PH poverty incidence}}
The total annual income of the city for the year under review is P429,389,619. It is derived from the actual collections of local revenues and Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA).

The city has a total number of 4,965 business establishments, in which 4,750 of which are classified as commercial and 215 as industrial. It has 11 pawnshops, 16 lending corporation and five banking institutions which provide financial capital to businessmen.

The principal sources of livelihood are agriculture and fishing, with employment and business as a secondary source of income.

Cadiz has a total agricultural area of 36,475.7429 hectares. Sugarcane remains as the prime agricultural commodity with as large as 23,571.1445 hectares or 64.5242% of the total agricultural area.

Fish supply is more than what the city currently needs. Being rich in natural resources and considered as one of the few fishing centers of Negros Occidental, Cadiz, rich in marine resources, is envisioned to be the seafood center of Negros and an alternative tourist destination. In Barangays Daga and Tiglawigan, for instance, dried fish processing and boat building are the major economic activities.

A P37 million multi-purpose seaport, still under construction, is envisioned to encourage both fishing and commercial vessels to dock in and use the area for trade and industry. This nationally funded seaport would create more jobs in the city.

So far, four companies (San Miguel Corp., Pepsi Cola, Coca-Cola and Jaz Cola) have established their distribution centers within the city.

Also located in the city is the [[Cadiz Solar Power Plant]].

As of 2007, the city has 54 policemen serving its 150,750 citizens. The existing policemen-population ratio is 1:2,792 - above the standard ratio of 1:1,000. This necessitates that the city police force employs 97 more policemen.

The [[Philippine National Police]] has one headquarter located at the Villa Cristina Subdivision and 6 community police unit precincts located at Barangay Daga, Barangay Banquerohan, the Public Market, Fara-on Institute, Lacawon Island and Barangay Tiglawigan. There are 3 patrol vehicles and 3 motorcycles being utilized by the police force.

Considering that the police force ratio to the populace is not sufficient, the Civilian Volunteers Organization (CVO) was created to augment the policemen. Today, there are 40 members of CVO serving alongside the policemen of the city.

The city has 62 traffic enforcers helping policemen direct and control the traffic flow. The city planned to hire additional traffic enforcers by 2008.

There are three PA Detachments operating in the rural barangays with the main patrol base located at Had. Buenretiro, Barangay Burgos, I PA Special Detachment at Had. Bjormaine, Barangay Magsaysay and I PA Detachment at Had. Ladnon in Barangay Caduha-an.

The development of the Busac-Busac Spring, the city has 23 serviceable fire hydrants located at different strategic locations.

===Transportation and communication===
Cadiz is a one-hour drive from Bacolod City, the capital of Negros Occidental, by private car and an hour and fifteen minutes ride by a passenger bus. The Vallacar Transit (Ceres), the largest bus company, has a terminal here. Buses plying to San Carlos, Dumaguete, and the nearby municipalities make short stopovers here. Other services of transportations available are PUJ and van for hire vehicles. Cadiz is also accessible to Cebu via the cities of San Carlos and Escalante. Passenger buses for Cebu also pass by at the bus terminal on scheduled trips.

The existence of communication facilities in any area plays a vital role in economic development. These facilities lessen the cost of transportation and likewise shorten the time in transacting business. Cadiz has a Bureau of Telecommunications and a post Office located at the City Engineer's Compound. There is also an air cargo service in the city. Two private companies, the JRS and LBC,  also deliver mail. Unlike the post office, home mail delivery of these private companies reaches the rural areas.

The Cadiz Post Office has only two mail carriers and seven office personnel, including the postmaster. The recommended ratio between letter carriers and the population is 1:5,000. With the projected population of 161,393 in 2005, the current ratio between letter carriers and population is placed at 1:80,696. The city needs to hire 30 additional personnel to meet the requirement of 32 letter carriers. The population is estimated to be 165,589 in 2006; hence, an additional of 31 letter carriers will be needed to meet the new requirement of 33 letter carriers.

Two telephone companies operate in the city, the Philippine Long Distance telephone Company located along Villena Street with a capacity of 1,500 lines and the Globe Fiber Optic Backbone Network support facility located along Cabahug Street. Cellular sites of Smart, Globe and Sun are also found in the city to cater for the wireless telephone system. The city has also five internet cafes.
