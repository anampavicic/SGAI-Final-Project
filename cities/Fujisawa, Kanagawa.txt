[[File:Fujisawa City Hall.jpg|thumb|Fujisawa City Hall]]

{{Nihongo|'''Fujisawa'''|藤沢市|Fujisawa-shi}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. {{As of|2021|06|01}}, the city had an estimated [[population]] of 439,728 and a [[population density]] of 6300 persons per km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="Fujisawa-hp">{{cite web |url=https://www.city.fujisawa.kanagawa.jp/bunsho/shise/toke/jinko/jinko/index.html|title= Fujisawa city official statistics|location= Japan|language= ja}}</ref> The total area of the city is {{convert|69.57|sqkm|sqmi}}.

==Geography==
Fujisawa is in the south-central part of Kanagawa Prefecture. It faces [[Sagami Bay]] of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The northern part of the city is on the Sagamino plateau while the southern part is abutted on the Shonan Beach.

Fujisawa has three major topographical features: the island of [[Enoshima]] to the south connected to the [[Katase]] shoreline area by a road bridge, and two rivers, the [[Hikiji River|Hikiji]] and the [[Sakai River (Tokyo, Kanagawa)|Sakai]], which run north-south. The [[Hikiji River|Hikiji]] can be traced from an area designated as a nature reserve park in the city of Yamato and flows directly along the boundary of the joint [[US Navy]] and [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] [[Naval Air Facility Atsugi|Atsugi Naval Air Base]] and the [[United States Army]] [[Camp Zama]].  The Sakai runs directly from the mountains between [[Machida, Tokyo|Machida]] and [[Hachiōji, Tokyo|Hachiōji]], and for quite some distance forms the border between the Tokyo Metropolitan Area and Kanagawa Prefecture. From Machida city centre, the river can be directly followed by a foot and cycle path to Fujisawa city centre, a distance of approximately {{cvt|35|km}}. Another cycle path runs along the Shonan Coastal path, from the Sagami River, in Hiratsuka, to Enoshima Bridge in Fujisawa.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
[[File:Fujisawa in 1930s.jpg|thumb|Fujisawa in 1933]]
The area around present-day Fujisawa City has been inhabited for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found stone tools and [[shell midden]]s from the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period, ceramic shards from the [[Jōmon period]], and graves from the [[Kofun period]] at numerous locations. The area is mentioned in the [[Nara period]] {{lang|ja-latn|[[Nihon Shoki]]}} chronicles. By the [[Heian period]], central [[Sagami Province]] was divided into ''[[shōen]]'' controlled by the Muroaoka, Oe, and other local warlords. During the [[Kamakura period]], Fujisawa was the setting for a number of battles to overthrow the [[Kamakura shogunate]] as mentioned in the late 14th century [[Taiheiki]]. During the [[Muromachi period]], Fujisawa developed around [[Shōjōkō-ji|Yugyo-ji]], a Buddhist temple, which was established in 1325.

With the [[Edo period]], Fujisawa prospered as [[Fujisawa-shuku]], a [[shukuba|post station]] on the [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]] highway connecting [[Edo]] with [[Kyoto]]. ''[[Shōgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] built a palace in Fujisawa as a rest stop between Edo and [[Sunpu Domain|Sunpu]].

Following the [[Meiji Restoration]], the area was divided into villages in [[Kōza District, Kanagawa|Kōza District]] and [[Kamakura District, Kanagawa|Kamakura District]] within Kanagawa Prefecture. The Kōza District office was located in Fujisawa from 1878. The area developed rapidly after the opening of [[Fujisawa Station]] of [[Tōkaidō Main Line]] in 1887.

During the cadastral reform of April 1, 1889, Fujisawa-Ōsaka Town (in Kōza District) and Fujisawa-Ōtomi Town (in Kamakura District) were created through the merger of local hamlets. [[Emperor Meiji]] visited Fujisawa in 1891 to watch military maneuvers. The IJA 49th Infantry Regiment under the [[IJA 1st Division]] was stationed in Fujisawa from 1907. During the same year, Fujisawa-Ōsaka Town absorbed Fujisawa-Ōtomi Town and expanded further in 1908 by annexing the neighboring villages of Kugenuma and Meiji (both from Kamakura District), renaming itself Fujisawa Town.

The [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]] caused severe damage to Fujisawa, with some 4,000 houses destroyed. An [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] Artillery School was established in Tsujido in 1926.

The town of Fujisawa was elevated to city status on October 1, 1940. Fujisawa expanded by annexing the village of Muraoka in 1941, the village of Mutsuai in 1942, the town of Katase in 1947, and the villages of Goshomi, Chogo, Takakura and parts of Koide (hamlet of Endo) in 1955. Fujisawa hosted the yachting events of the [[1964 Summer Olympics]]. 

These improved transport links, such as the [[Yokohama Subway]] line and express train services on the [[Odakyu]] line, have made Fujisawa an increasingly attractive and cost-effective [[commuter town|commuter suburb]] for [[Tokyo]] and [[Yokohama]].

==Government==
Fujisawa has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 36 members. Fujisawa contributes five members to the Kanagawa Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Kanagawa 12th district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Fujisawa has a mixed economy with a strong industrial base. [[Isuzu]] retains a large truck factory at Tsuchidana. [[Kobe Steel]] has a factory in the east of the city, as does [[NSK Ltd.|NSK]] Microprecision, a maker of bearings and precision parts. [[Sony]] operates the Shonan Technology Center in Fujisawa.<ref>"[http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/CorporateInfo/Data/Map/index.html Access & Map]." ''[[Sony]]''. Retrieved on January 19, 2009.</ref> [[Ebara Corporation]], a major manufacturer of pumps and water treatment equipment has a plant in Fujisawa.<ref>[http://www.ebara.com/en/company/office/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531015416/http://www.ebara.com/en/company/office/|date=2016-05-31}} Ebara official home page</ref>

Fujisawa has extensive commercial shopping facilities and has the largest commercial city centre on the Shonan coast. Fujisawa is also a [[bedroom community]] for Yokohama and Tokyo.

== Education ==
There are four university campuses in Fujisawa: prestigious [[Keio University]]'s [[Shonan Fujisawa Campus]] (SFC) with three faculties and a graduate school in Endo, [[Nihon University]]'s School of Natural Science at Mutsuai, and [[Tama University]]'s Global Studies Faculty near Shonandai, all in the northern part of the city, and the [[Shonan Institute of Technology]] (SIT) in Tsujido Nishikaigan to the south.

Fujisawa has 35 public elementary schools and 19 public middle schools as well as one private elementary school and six private combined middle/high schools, including the [[Shonan Shirayuri Gakuen Junior High School and High School]] and [[Keio Shonan-Fujisawa Junior and Senior High School]]. The city has six public high schools operated by the Kanagawa Prefectural Board of Education, including [[Shonan High School]], one of the leading high schools in Kanagawa with former Tokyo Governor [[Shintaro Ishihara]] as a graduate. There are three private schools. The prefecture also operates one special education school for the handicapped.

==Local attractions==
[[File:Ehoshima-Island-Fujisawa-Japan.jpg|thumb|[[Enoshima|Enoshima Island]]]]

Fujisawa remains at the centre of the 'Shōnan lifestyle' image, and its good rail and adequate road connections make it a very popular destination for day trippers from the Kanto region. Surfing and beach volleyball tournaments in summertime attract visitors, especially younger people, and they are also drawn to the seasonal bars and rest houses that are erected along the beach from [[Kugenuma Kaigan]] to [[Enoshima]] Kaigan.

Fujisawa has two major firework displays in the summer, in late July and early August, usually sandwiched in between similar festivals in Chigasaki, Hiratsuka, Kamakura, and Yokohama.

Enoshima Island has many attractions, including a botanical gardens and the [[Enoshima Sea Candle]] which is open to visitors. Its height of 119.6 meters above sea level affords an excellent view of the area and, on a clear day, [[Mount Fuji]]. There are a number of famous [[Shinto shrine]]s, some in caves on the south side of the island.

One of Fujisawa's most popular seasonal products is ''shirasu'', similar to but much smaller and softer than [[whitebait]].
