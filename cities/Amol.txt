==History==

===Pre-Islamic===
According to the city government, the name is derived from ''[[Amardi]]'', a tribe mentioned by the Roman historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://amol.gov.ir/index.php?static&sid=700 |title=Amol Government |access-date=November 28, 2016 |archive-date=November 28, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128195626/http://amol.gov.ir/index.php?static&sid=700 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Amol is one of the most ancient cities of Iran. A number of historians and geographers believe it was established in the 1st millennium BC. Some historians have attributed the birth of the city during the reign of the mythological king [[Tahmuras]].<ref name="Amol origin at Hamshahri">[http://ostani.hamshahrilinks.org/Ostan/Iran/Mazandaran/Contents/%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87-%D9%88-%D9%BE%DB%8C%D8%B4%DB%8C%D9%86%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%84-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%87-%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86?magazineid= Amol origin at Hamshahri]{{Dead link|date=April 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

====Pishdadian and Amard====
[[File:Median Empire.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[Median Empire]] (600 BC) showing the relative locations of the [[Amardian]] tribe]]
Some historians have associated this ancient city with the periods of the [[Pishdadian dynasty]] and the [[Kayanian dynasty]].  The  people inhabiting the area before the arrival of [[Aryans]], were known as Amards (Amui in Pahlavi),<ref>Eurasia book / 178.2</ref> who had migrated to and settled on the Iranian Plateau between the late [[2nd millennium BC]] and early [[1st millennium BC]].  According to historical literature, Amol was the capital of [[Mazandaran]], at least in the period starting from [[Sassanid Empire]] to the [[Ilkhanate]] dynasty of [[Mongol Empire]]. Though they are a [[Medes|Median]] tribe, [[Herodotus]] named the tribe Mardians as one of the ten to fifteen [[Persian people|Persian]] tribes in Persis. It is now known that the only distinction between the Median Amardians and the Persian Mardians is the 'a' at the beginning of ''Amardians,'' which would mean they are two different tribes. Elsewhere he says, one of the peoples who have trusted [[Darius I]]<ref name="Amol History in EurasiaTravel">{{Cite web|url=http://eurasia.travel/iran/places/western_iran/amol/|title=Amol|website=eurasia.travel|access-date=July 29, 2020|archive-date=December 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201081931/http://eurasia.travel/iran/places/western_iran/amol/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Igor M. Diakonoff]] says that Amardians lived on the coasts of the [[Caspian Sea]], in the distance of the Alban and Otia from the north and the [[Hyrcanian]] from the east.

[[Strabo]] says about the Tapyri that they wore black robes and had long hair, and "he who is adjudged the bravest marries whomever he wishes" (''Geography'' 11.8 = T520a). In the history of the [[Persian Empire]], the Mard were handsome, capable and brave persons present in the heart of the army and were responsible for defending the commander.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iranicaonline.org/articles/army-i|title=ARMY i. Pre-Islamic Iran – Encyclopaedia Iranica|website=iranicaonline.org|access-date=July 29, 2020}}</ref>) The Amard helped Achaemenid in several battles including the invasion of [[Greece]], the occupation of Sardis, the attack of Medes and at the [[Battle of Opis]].
[[Ibn Isfandiyar]] has another theory about Amol which  says, at the request of his wife, Firoz Shah created a large and flourishing city named Amele.<ref>Tabaristan History Book, Page 191</ref>

====Achaemenid Empire====
People of Amol were p, the current Caspian Sea.<ref>The Persian Empire: A Corpus of Sources from the Achaemenid Period</ref> Further evidence of the power of the Amol people is their fighting in the [[Battle of Thermopylae]], [[Battle of Gaugamela]] and other [[Sardis]] forces in the [[Achaemenid Empire]].<ref>Ancient history of Iran in foreign wars / 447.</ref> [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]] said, [[Immortals (Achaemenid Empire)]] Archers they were all Amard people.<ref>The Hyrcani had mustered 6000 as excellent horsemen as those nations could furnish, as well as 1000 Tapurian cavalry. The Derbices had armed 40000 foot-soldiers; most of these carried spears tipped with bronze or iron, but some had hardened the wooden shaft by fire. Curtius Rufus Quintus, history of ALEXANDER (3.2.7)</ref>

====Parthian Empire====
During the reign of the [[Parthian Empire]], Amol was one of the centers of Iran. It seems that Amol's reputation in the time of [[Alexander the Great]] and the Parthian period dominated the political-administrative [[Satrap]] was [[Hyrcanian]].<ref>Parthian History Book by Igor M. Diakonoff</ref> During the Parthian period, Amol was also famous and prosperous, which was called ''Homo'' or ''Hamo''. Parthian King [[Phraates I]] (171–173 AH) defeated the Mardas in the Amol region. He is said to have moved a group of people to the Parthian lands in northern [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and settled in western [[Amu Darya]], also known as Amol Zam.

====Sassanian====

According to historical literature, Amol was the capital of [[Mazandaran]] during the period starting from the 3rd century AD under the [[Sassanian Empire]] to the 13/14th century AD under the [[Ilkhanate]] dynasty of [[Mongol Empire]]. Before Islam, Amol was one of the largest and most important cities in the region and was considered the center of Mazandaran. The city of Amol existed before the [[Sassanids]] and during the [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] period. During the [[Sassanid]] period, the importance of this Amol was increased due to the escape of the followers of [[Mazdak]] to this city.
Based on pieces of evidence, including the coins found during excavations in addition to Muslim historical books, Amol was the capital of Mazandaran province during the [[Sassanid Era]].
According to historical literature, Amol was the capital of [[Mazandaran]] during the period starting from the 3rd century under [[Sassanian Empire]] to the 13/14th century under the [[Ilkhanate]] dynasty of [[Mongol Empire]]. On Sasanian coins, coin cities where there has been an abbreviated name is known, but the mark ''m'' was Amol. During the [[Bahram V]], Amol was Central to Iran and during the [[Khosrow II]] and [[Dabuyid dynasty]] capital Mazandaran.
[[Amu Darya]] The Sasanian Pers River is about 2,500&nbsp;km long, regarded in ancient times as the boundary between Iran and [[Turan]]; the modern name may be derived from Amol.<ref>Encyclopædia Iranica -Amudarya</ref>
In the city during this period, there was a Temple, [[Marketplace|Market]], and [[fireplace]] there was. Ibn Rawi, in his book, calls Amol bigger than [[Isfahan]] and [[Qazvin]].<ref>Book History Sassanian Emp</ref>
[[File:Coin of Khosrow II, minted in Amol.jpg|thumb|left|Coin of [[Khosrow II]], minted in Amol]]

[[Hudud al-'Alam]] had said about Amol, that it was a great city with most moats and castles, the universe and the origin of merchants, and city Carpet, mats, boxwood, bowls, brick, and medallions are found.<ref>ḤODUD AL-ʿĀLAM – Encyclopædia Iranica</ref>

During the [[Sassanid]] period, the city of Amol enjoyed development and was the center of the important province of Tabarestan. During this period, the city had infrastructures and elements such as government citadels, neighborhoods, fire temples, and bazaars and a fire temple in the area, called  ''Avam Kuye''.<ref>Herodotus (1987).

It can be argued that the mints of several cities in Mazandaran, especially Amol and Sari, such as the city of [[Gorgan]], have been engaged in minting various coins for 1,300 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irna.ir/news/83699166/مازندران-در-عصر-ناصری-و-ضرابخانه-های-۱۳۰۰-ساله|title=مازندران در عصر ناصری و ضرابخانه‌های ۱۳۰۰ ساله|date=March 3, 2020|website=ایرنا|access-date=July 29, 2020}}</ref>

===Islam===
==== Abbasid, Alid, Ziyarid, Marashis ====
Amol, in the era of the [[Alid dynasties of northern Iran|Alid dynasties]] and [[Marashis]] dynasty, was the capital of [[Northern Iran]]. The inhabitants of Amol embraced [[Islam]] during the reign of [[Al-Mahdi|Mahdi]] (775–785), the [[Abbasid]] Caliph. Amol was also the capital city of the [[Bavand dynasty]] and [[Ziyarid dynasty]].
The people of Amol initially resisted the Arabs.
In the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] of the ninth century, Amol was one of the largest cities in Iran. [[Khalid ibn Barmak]] built a palace in the city and ruled for years. People from the [[Qarinvand dynasty]] arrived a couple of years ago and fought with the Abbasid Caliphate to win the kingdom.
During the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] period, during the reign of [[Muawiyah I]], [[Sa'id ibn al-As]] undertook the conquest of Tabaristan, and with an army of 4,000 troops rushed there, and the whole war between him and [[Farrukhan the Great]] lasted for two whole years, but was postponed. The conflict lasted until [[Abbasid Caliphate]] until the attack of the Persian general [[Wandad Hurmuzd]].

In [[Hudud al-'Alam]], Amol is regarded as a great city with active commerce and trading ventures.<ref>Mentioned in the book, page 142</ref> However, resentment with the [[Tahirids]] rule increased due to the oppressive activities of their officials. People of the provinces pledged alliance to [[Hasan ibn Zayd]]. Zayd became the founder of the [[Zaydid dynasty]] of Tabaristan Alavids government in [[Tabaristan]] established and it's with Amol centered and 106-year domination of the Abbasids in the territory ended.<ref>Estakhri Book, Page 169</ref>
[[Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar|Yaqub ibn Layth]] the was geostrategy in Amol. [[Hasan al-Utrush]] with a trip to Amol who re-established Zaydid rule over the province Tabaristan in northern Iran in 914, after fourteen years of [[Samanid]] rule.
After the Alid dynasty, the Ziyarid dynasty ruled Iran and Tabaristan. At this time Amol was developed in such a way that geographers have written articles about the industry and its silk.<ref>Ibn Isfandiyar Tarikh-Tabaristan Book</ref>
[[Hasan ibn Zayd]], nicknamed al-Dai al-Kabir, appeared in the Tabaristan region in 250 AH, and many dissatisfied people and the captives of the Caliph [[Tahirid]] strengthened him. He invited people and published the Shiite religion. After coming to power in Tabaristan, Daei Kabir moved his capital from Sari to Amol, which was Taherian's seat.<ref>Madelung, W. (1975).

In 260 A.D., [[Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar]] marched on Tabaristan and entered Amol after the departure of Hassan ibn Zayd, but his rule did not last long and the Alavids recaptured the city again. The Alawites ruled the city until [[Ziyarid]] and [[Buyid]], who were the handmaidens of the Shiites. The people of Amol were very militant and stood up to the Arabs, but social injustice and class divisions led the people to convert to Islam.<ref>Bosworth, C.E. (1975). "The Ṭāhirids and Ṣaffārids".

[[Qabus]] was in 1012 overthrown by his own army and was succeeded by his son [[Manuchihr]], who quickly recognized the sovereignty of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] and married one of his daughters. Manuchihr died in 1031 and was succeeded by his son [[Anushirvan Sharaf al-Ma'ali]], whom Mahmud of Ghazni had chosen as the heir of the [[Ziyarid dynasty]]. From 1032 to 1040, the real power behind the throne was held by Abu Kalijar ibn Vayhan, a relative of Anushirvan Sharaf al-Ma'ali. During this period, Amol was chosen as the capital of Iran until 1090. He also had the first seminary by [[Hasan al-Utrush]] built in Amol, which was later named Imam Hassan Askari Mosque.
The subsequent [[Afrasiyab dynasty]] flourished in the late medieval, pre-Safavid period; it is also called the Kia dynasty. It was founded by Kiya Afrasiyab, who conquered the Bavand kingdom in 1349 and made himself king of the region, in Amol.<ref>ĀL-E Afrasiab</ref><ref>[http://www.iran-daily.com/News/137147.html Amol boasts numerous ancient sites]</ref>

====Safavid====
In the time of the [[Safavid]] rulers of Mazandaran, Amol experienced a period of growth. The city was the favorite dwelling of [[Abbas II of Persia]], who often frequented it. At the time Amol was considered "the capital of the inhabited world" and acclaimed for its grandeur. Several bridges were built in the area across the Haraz River at this time.
During the Safavid era, especially during the reign of [[Abbas the Great]], Mazandaran was considered and a road from [[Gorgan|Astarabad]] and Sari to Amol was built.

But after the [[Mongol invasion]], the region was subject to devastation and it was during this time that Sari was declared as capital. At the beginning of the 7th century, Hessamedin Ardeshir shifted the capital from Sari to Amol and constructed his palace there.
At this time, a Palace and Ab Anbar were built by order of Shah Abbas, and the [[Mausoleum of Mir Bozorg|tomb of Mir Ghavam al-Din (Mir Bozorg)]], which had been destroyed by Timur's agents, was magnificently rebuilt.<ref>Vasily Bartold /  An Historical Geography of Iran, Princeton, 1984 translated by Svat Soucek</ref>
Amol recovered a certain measure of prosperity while ruled by the Marashians and the Safavids. Under the latter, it was a center of the province of [[Mazandaran]]. Since then, it has never played a leading part in Persian national affairs, being surpassed in population by [[Babol]] and by the administrative capital of the province [[Sari]]; it has also suffered at various times from earthquakes.
In continuation, [[Haraz River]] crosses the city of coal and iron mining region of Amol much iron can also have it in the past.<ref>History Central Asian, Mazandaran</ref>

====Afsharid====
Amol in [[Afsharid dynasty]] and [[Zand dynasty]] as a city for trade and construction were instruments of war. During the [[Nader Shah]] in town was founded Iron plant through the trade center position to make cannonballs, mortars, and horseshoes, and business centers already exceeded and founded [[artillery]]. This was the first artillery workshop in [[Iran]]<ref>H. Ardakani Book</ref>
[[Jonas Hanway]] came to Iran at this time and visited Amol and talked about this city, Due to the abundance of iron ore mines, by Nader Shah's order, it became the most important foundry and steel plant, where cannonballs, rifles, and horseshoes were produced. Nader Shah eventually decided to build the Iranian Navy in Amol.<ref>1762 Jonas Hanway Travel Trade PERSIA Iran Illustrated MAPS Iraq Russia 2v SET</ref>
At first, the people and rulers of [[Larijan (district)|Larijan]]<ref>The Links between Art and Politics during the Qajar Era</ref> and Amol, in support of [[Zand dynasty]], resisted [[Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar]] and defeated him.

====Qajar====
[[File:Le Tour du monde-02-p048.jpg|thumb|left|Merchants and travelers under Damavand mountain by [[Jules Laurens]] on July 1, 1859]]
In the Qajar era, the road and railway from [[Tehran]] to Amol, Amol was pulled from [[Mahmoudabad]].
[[Ibn Hawqal]] says the geographers of the 4th to 10th century describe Amol's great prosperity and prosperity; in the latter respect, according to Ebn Ḥawqal, it surpassed Qazvin. Its inner city was protected by a moat, and the houses were constructed of wood and reeds rather than mud bricks on account of the heavy summer rainfall. Rice, fruits, and vegetables grew profusely, and the town was a center for the fabrication of wooden articles, textiles, and carpets, the silks being especially famous. Amol port on the Caspian was the little town named ''Ahlam'' or ''Ahlom''.<ref>C. E. BOSWORTH, S. BLAIR, E. EHLERS, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/amol-a-town-on-the-caspian-shore About Amol in Iranicaonline]</ref>
[[James George Frazer]] entered Iran in 1238 as a merchant and scientist and said about this city in his travelogue that the city was truly great and vast. People were decent and respectable inhabitants of the city. Several leaders of the Iranian constitutional revolutions of 1905 and 1911 hailed from Amol. Mulla Ali Kani, one Amoli people reformist who led the people, had a great role in the achievement of the goals of Iran's constitutional revolution.
During this period, was built many homes in the city. Although today Amol has expanded greatly on both sides of the [[Haraz river]], its functions are still the same as they were seventy or eighty years ago.<ref>M.

=====Pahlavi, Islamic Republic of Iran=====
During the reign of [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]], the face of the town was changed drastically. Schools and most of the streets and governmental buildings current Amol date from that era. During this period, by order of Reza Shah, Austrian and German engineers built [[Moalagh Bridge]], a Municipal mansion, a Municipal hotel, Chaikhori palace, Pahlavi High School, an Asset building, and a Rice warehouse for export. During this period, the construction of an alternative [[Haraz road]] was handed over to the Russian company Treskiniski by the Reza Shah.

With the beginning of the [[Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran|Islamic Republic of Iran]], there was a forest uprising. The [[1982 Amol uprising|Jungle Uprising]] in 1982 of the [[Union of Iranian Communists (Sarbedaran)]] mobilized its forces to jungles around Amol and started  wars against the Islamic Republic in those jungles. It finally organized a famous uprising on January 25, 1982. The Communist Union, based on its Maoist policy and with its mindset of guerrilla and peasant wars, established on the outskirts of the Haraz Road pathway of several important provinces and cities of the country and suitable camouflage of Amol forest and mine reasons to choose in the forest its strategy for war. The union assassinated 600 people during three operations in Amol on November 9 and 13, 1981, and January 25, 1982. The [[Mojahedin]] used machine guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers against units of the Pasdaran. Smaller left-wing opposition groups, including the [[Organization of Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas]], attempted similar guerrilla activities. In July 1981, members of the Union of Communists tried to seize control of the town of Amol. This uprising was a failure, and most of the Maoist and UIC leaders were hanged, but the uprising itself became very famous and is well respected among some Iranian Leftist organizations. It also experienced various theoretical and political crises. The clashes lasted from November to February for four months.

This day became known in the Iranian calendar as ''Epic 6 Bahman'' or ''Epic of the People of Amol''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.concepts.org/index.php?title=1982_Amol_uprising|title=::1982 Amol uprising – ::concepts|website=www.concepts.org|access-date=July 29, 2020|archive-date=January 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116135239/http://www.concepts.org/index.php?title=1982_Amol_uprising|url-status=dead}}</ref> After this incident, [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] only mentioned the name of the city of Amol in the political and divine testament and wrote, ''We have to thank the people of Amol''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://farsi.khamenei.ir/imam-content?id=8638|title=باید از مردم آمل تشکر کنیم|website=farsi.khamenei.ir|access-date=July 29, 2020}}</ref>

Some of the most recent projects have been the complete restoration of the Bazaar and of Imam Reza Street, as well as a comprehensive plan for the preservation of the old city quarters. A lot of different construction projects are currently underway, that intend to modernize the city's infrastructure.
In the last few years, many squares, towers, boulevards, and bridges were built in Amol. For example, Haraz Street is one of the most modern streets of [[northern Iran]]. Amol is growing and turning into an industrialized town like most of the large Iranian cities. Today, Amol is a thriving metropolis. One of the things they really lack is an airport so there are no cheap flights to Amol. Some of the most famous companies in Iran have main offices located in this city. Good secondary and tertiary education is being offered here as well. Islamic Azad University, for instance, is one of the biggest universities in the Middle East. Now in Amol, there is a municipality and special governor. Amol is one of the research centers for scientific development, knowledge-based sciences, and the Science and Technology Park of Iran. At present, Amol is the center of dairy and livestock products, mining sand, nurturing products such as meat, flowers, and fish, and producing rice in Iran. Industrial machinery products are also very popular in Amol and Iran Heavy Diesel Factory is located in Amol Industrial Town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flighthub.com/cheap-flights-to-Amol|title=Cheap flights to Amol &#124; FlightHub|website=www.flighthub.com|access-date=July 29, 2020}}</ref>

==Culture==
Amol has a long history based on  its ancestors, who were intellectuals and had great contributions to local and national events. Depending on the culture of the people some of the ancient ceremonies mingled with  Mazandaran Islamic traditions. Amol is a center for Iranian culture and has produced a number of famous poets. Wool, felting, felt hat production, and mat weaving are part of the Amoli culture. Varf Chal, Locho Wrestling, Palm and [[Tiregan]] named ''Damavand National Day'' are local events held each year. Tirgan is an important celebration in Iran's history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranreview.org/content/Documents/_Arash_the_Archer_and_the_Festival_of_Rain.htm|title=Tirgan: The Festival of Rain|website=www.iranreview.org|access-date=July 29, 2020}}</ref> In Mazandaran, this day is known as ''Tir Maah Sizdah Sho''. The name literally means 13th night of the month of Tir. It occurs on the 12th of Aban, the 8th month of the Persian calendar, and is celebrated in the province of Mazandaran. Its history goes back to the pre-Islamic era of Iran and is mentioned in the accredited history book of Tarikh Tabari. The celebration has a specific procedure, 13 different kinds of edibles are prepared, and members of the household should stay home for that special night. Tiregan is one of the biggest festivals in ancient Iran. Traditionally, it is held on the Tir day (ancient days) of Tir month, equal to the 13th of the month in the Zoroastrian calendar, and equivalent to the 10th of Tir in Shamsi year.
Tiregan is celebrated on the 13th of Tir in the foothills of Rineh city of Larijan in Amol, Mazandaran Province. It is celebrated by splashing water, dancing, reciting poetry, and serving traditional foods such as spinach soup and sholezard. The custom of tying rainbow-colored bands on wrists, which are worn for ten days and then thrown into a stream, is also a way to rejoice by the children of the city.
Another ceremony is called Varf Chal. Every spring, people in Ab Ask, a village near the northern city of Amol, mark a 600-year-old ceremony called Varf Chal, which literally means snow storing.

[[Nowruz]] - Iranians celebrate this ancient festival and is also important in Amol. [[Nowruz Khani]], or singing for Nowruz, is a Tabari Gilani tradition in which in the latest days of the year before the Persian New Year (Nowrooz), people go at the door of their neighbors and sing songs about the impending coming of the spring.
Locho wrestling has been held in the north of Iran in Mazandaran as a traditional, frank, and ancient sport for 1600 years. This wrestling, which is also known as the Locho heroic sport, has a particular position in the culture and valuable beliefs of the locals, and now, it is a national registered heritage.
Amoli people are said to spend much on books, clothes and food. They spend their leisure time going to cinemas, art exhibitions, music concerts, and international book fairs that are held in the city most of the time in the year.
Amol is known as the city of Mystics and philosophers, Hezar sangar, Productive, and Alavian. Amol has been host [[Fajr International Theater Festival]] and Jasmine International Film Festival.

===Old district of Amol===
The main body of the old city of Amol is located in the old bazaar of Amol. The old bazaar is the main pillar and core of the city's organizer, and its original existence dates back to before Islam and its core 900 years ago. The main constituents of the city Bazaar Amol, known as ''Paein Baazar'' or '' Bazaar Chaharsogh'' situated in the city center, have lost some of their former importance due to social, economic, and historical reasons. The roofs of the shops here are made of earthenware tiles on an incline so as to be a protection against the sun and rain. The open spaces within, are used to set up weekly bazaars.
Historic mosques and old houses located along the market and tribal quarters of the people are also available in the market.
