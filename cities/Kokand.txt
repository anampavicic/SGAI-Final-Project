'''Kokand''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|k|æ|n|d}} {{respell|KOH-kand}}){{efn|{{langx|uz|Қўқон|Qo‘qon}}, {{IPA|uz|qoˈqɒn|IPA}}; {{langx|ru|Коканд}} {{IPA|ru|kɐˈkant|}}; {{langx|tg|Қӯқанд|Qo‘qand}}; {{langx|fa|خوقند|Xuqand}}; {{langx|kk|Қоқан|Qoqan}}; {{langx|chg|{{nq|خوقند}}|''Xuqand''}}; {{langx|ky|Кокон|Kokon}}}} is a city in [[Fergana Region]] in eastern [[Uzbekistan]], at the southwestern edge of the [[Fergana Valley]]. Administratively, Kokand is a district-level city, that includes the [[urban-type settlement]] [[Muqimiy]].<ref name=class>{{cite web|url=https://stat.uz/uploads/docs/soato(mhobt)_2020.xlsx|title=Classification system of territorial units of the Republic of Uzbekistan|language=uz, ru|date=July 2020|publisher=The State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on statistics}}</ref> The population of Kokand {{As of|2022|lc=y}} was approximately 259,700.<ref name="farstat" /> The city lies {{convert|228|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Tashkent]], {{convert|115|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Andijan]], and {{convert|88|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Fergana]]. It is nicknamed "City of Winds". In 1877 when the first ethnographic works were done under the new imperial Russian administration, Khoqand/Kokand was reported and visually depicted on their maps as [[Tajiks|Tajik]] inhabited oasis (C.E de Ujfalvy (“Carte Ethnographique du Ferghanah, 1877”). The city and the entire eastern 3/4 of the [[Fergana Valley]] were included in [[Uzbekistan]] in the 1920s and [[Stalin]]'s dictates of political borders.

Kokand is at the crossroads of the two main ancient trade routes into the Fergana Valley, one leading northwest over the mountains to Tashkent, and the other west through [[Khujand]]. As a result, Kokand is the main transportation junction in the Fergana Valley.

== Etymology ==

The city's name is in conformity with other Central Asian cities that sport the element ''kand/kent/qand/jand'', meaning "a city" in [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] as well as other [[Iranic]] languages. The [[Khwarazmian language|Khwarazmian]] version was ''kath'', which is still found in the name of the old city of Akhsikath/[[Akhsikat]] in the [[Fergana Valley]] of [[Uzbekistan]]. The prefix ''khu/hu'' is [[Iranic]] might stand "good" (as in modern [[Tajik language|Tajik]] ''khub''), and would therefore translate as "good city". {{citation needed|date=October 2023}}

Another explanation claims a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] derivation, and might refer to the "tribal family group of 'Kokan' who belong to the Kongrat tribe of [[Uzbeks]]".<ref>Географические названия мира: Топонимический словарь. — М: АСТ. Поспелов Е.М. 2001.</ref>

== History ==

The town of Kokand is one of the oldest towns in Uzbekistan and is situated in the western part of Fergana Valley. In the chronicles of the 10th century, the first written documents concerning town of Hukande, Havokande (old names of the town). In the 13th century, like most of Central Asian towns, the Mongols ruined the city. The town is a significant hub for trading on the Silk Route.[https://samarkandtours.com/uzbekistan/kokand]<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Kokand, Uzbekistan|url=https://samarkandtours.com/uzbekistan/kokand|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 30, 2021|website=}}</ref>

Kokand has existed since at least the 10th century, under the name of '''Khavakand''', and was frequently mentioned in traveler's accounts of the caravan route between [[South Asia]] and [[East Asia]]. The [[Han dynasty]] of China conquered the entire city in the 1st century BC. Later, the Arabs conquered the region from [[Tang Empire]]. The [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] destroyed Kokand in the 13th century.

The present city began as a fort in 1732 on the site of another older fortress called '''Eski-Kurgan'''. In 1740, it became the capital of an Uzbek kingdom, the [[Khanate of Kokand]], which reached as far as [[Kyzylorda]] to the west and [[Bishkek]] to the northeast. Kokand was also the major religious center of the Fergana Valley, boasting more than 300 [[mosque]]s.

Imperial forces of [[Russian Empire]] under [[Mikhail Skobelev]] captured the city in 1883 which then became part of [[Russian Turkistan]]. During World War I, two revolutions happened in the Russian Empire. it was the capital of the short-lived (72 days) (1917–18) anti-[[Bolshevik]] Provisional Government of Autonomous Turkistan (also known as [[Kokand Autonomy]]).<ref>''[[The Politics of Muslim Cultural Reform: Jadidism in Central Asia]]'' by Adeeb Khalid, [[Oxford University Press]], 2000</ref> They sought co-operation from [[Alexander Dutov|Ataman Dutov]] and [[Alash Orda]]. However, their emissary to the [[Mohammed Alim Khan|Amir]] of [[Bukhara]] achieved little.

In September 1918, Russian settlers organised in the indipendent Tashkent Soviet burned down the city and massacred over ten thousand citizens.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OB90AwAAQBAJ |pages=253–255|title=Stalin: Paradox of Power, 1878-1928 |first=Stephen |last=Kotkin |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |year=2014|isbn=9780698170100}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ra4IAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA37 |pages=34–36 |title=Seeking Food Rights: Nation, Inequality and Repression in Uzbekistan |first=Nancy R. |last=Rosenberger |publisher=Cengage |year=2011 |isbn=9781133386520}}</ref>  {{Failed verification|date=July 2023}}

'''In the state of Dayuan'''

[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] research of Muyi Mubarak, Tepakurgan, Eski Kurgan and other [[monument]]s located in the city of Kokand revealed traces of civilization.

In Muyi Mubarak were found several [[clay]] shards of the 5th to 6th centuries; a clay platform, which in the 5th to 7th centuries served as the base of a monumental [[building]]; the remains of a [[Fortification|fortress]] [[wall]], built in the 1st to 2nd centuries of pahsa and [[mudbrick]]s, which functioned for more than 400 years. At a depth of 5 meters, a lower [[cultural layer]] with materials dating back 2,000 years was discovered.

In Tepakurgan, located in the center of the city, a platform from the [[Early Middle Ages]], which served as the base of a monumental [[castle]] with semicircular towers, was discovered, as in Muyi Mubarak.

The obtained artifacts give grounds to say and speculate that not later than the 7th century BC a certain part of the [[territory]] of the present city was developed for [[Irrigation|irrigated agriculture]].

And the city appeared not later than the 2nd half of the 2nd century BC and was the center of the [[Sokh District|Sokh]] oasis, that is, the [[Capital city|capital]] of the regional possession, which was part of the confederal state of [[Fergana]] ("Dayuan" of Chinese annals).

'''Havokand or Hokand'''

Arab geographers and travelers of the 10th century, [[Istakhri|Al-Istakhri]] and [[Ibn Hawqal|Ibn Haukal]] mention the city of Khovakand or Khokand, which in distance corresponds to the present Kokand.

According to written sources and local legends, there were ancient cities of [[Akhsikath]], Kubo ([[Quva]]), [[Rishton]], [[Osh]], Bab (Pop), [[Koson, Uzbekistan|Koson]] (Kashan), Mo-ar-gilon ([[Margilan]]), Andigan ([[Andijan]]), [[Özgön|Uzgen]], [[Isfara]], Varukh, [[Sokh District|Sokh]], [[Konibodom]] and [[Khujand]] in Fergana already at the time of its conquest by [[Arabs]] who established [[Islam]] here (in the beginning of 8th century).

Arab travelers of the X century mention many other towns and generally notice that, besides towns, there were many large villages in Fergana.

Havokand or Hokand, located on the [[Silk Road]] between [[India]] and [[China]] on one side and [[Iran|Persia]] and the [[Near East]] on the other, may have been a major [[trade]] center of its time. It was destroyed by the [[mongolic peoples]] in the 13th century.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Исторические и архитектурные памятники Коканда :: Архитектурные памятники и ансамбли Коканда |url=https://www.orexca.com/rus/uzbekistan/kokand/monuments_kokand.htm |access-date=2023-11-01 |website=www.orexca.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://ots.uz/ru/uzbekistan/cities-of-uzbekistan/29-kokand | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227102305/http://ots.uz/ru/uzbekistan/cities-of-uzbekistan/29-kokand | archive-date=2009-12-27 | title=Коканд }}</ref>

== Main sights ==

=== The Palace of Khudayar Khan ===
The [[Palace of Khudáyár Khán|Palace of Khudayar Khan]] was built between 1863 and 1874 by ruler [[Muhammad Khudayar Khan]]. American diplomat [[Eugene Schuyler|Eugene Schulyer]] described it as being "much larger and more magnificent than any other [palace] in Central Asia.”<ref name="uzbek-travel.com">{{Cite web|title=Khudoyar-Khan Palace, Kokand, Uzbekistan|url=http://uzbek-travel.com/about-uzbekistan/monuments/khudoyar-khan-palace/|access-date=2020-10-31|website=uzbek-travel.com}}</ref>

Khudayar Khan commissioned architect Mir Ubaydullo to build him a royal residence with 114 rooms set around seven courtyards.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Ibbotson|first=Sophie|title=Uzbekistan|publisher=Bradt Guides Ltd|year=2020|isbn=9-781784-771089|location=United Kingdom|pages=153}}</ref> The ruler wanted his mother to live in one of the palace's grand buildings, but she refused and set up her [[yurt]] in a courtyard.<ref name="uzbek-travel.com"/>

The facade of the building is decorated with mosaic tiles and an Arabic inscription above the entrance. The inscription translates as “The High palace of Seid Mohammad Khudayar Khan”.

Most of the palace, including its [[harem]], was demolished by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]], but 19 rooms remain in palace.<ref name="uzbek-travel.com"/> These are open to the public, and the interiors have been partially restored.<ref name=":0" /> They show a combination of Russian and traditional Uzbek styles, and the exquisite craftsmanship of Kokand's 19th-century artisans. It is possible to view the palace's collection of Chinese ceramics on request.<ref name=":0" />

=== Juma Mosque ===
Kokand's [[Jama masjid|Juma Mosque]] (Friday Mosque) is located on Chursu Square in the historic Icheri Sheher part of the city. It was built between 1812 and 1818 by [[Muhammad Umar Khan]], who was ruler of Kokand from 1810 until his death in 1822.

The mosque is built around a large courtyard and has a 100m long [[iwan]] supported on 98 redwood columns, which are ornately carved and were brought from India.<ref name=":0" /> The minaret is 22m high.<ref name="lonelyplanet.com">{{Cite web|title=Jami Mosque Museum {{!}} Kokand, Uzbekistan Attractions|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/uzbekistan/fergana-valley/kokand/attractions/jami-mosque-museum/a/poi-sig/1089584/357836|access-date=2020-10-31|website=Lonely Planet|language=en}}</ref>

Although intended to be Kokand's main place of worship, the Juma Mosque remained shut for most of the 20th century. It then reopened after much needed restoration in 1989 and now houses a small museum of applied arts with displays of embroideries and ceramics.<ref name="lonelyplanet.com"/>

=== Amin Beg Madrassah ===
The Amin Beg Madrassah, a religious school, was built in the 1830s for a son of [[Muhammad Ali Khan (Kokand)|Madali Khan]], the khan of Kokand from 1822 to 1842. The [[Madrasa|madrassah]] has a beautifully tiled facade, which was restored in 1913 by a craftsman called Khomol Khozi. For this reason, the madrassah is often called the Khomol Khozi Madrassah.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last1=Macleod|title=Decouverte Ouzbekistan|last2=Mayhew|publisher=Guide Olizane|year=2019|location=Geneva}}</ref> Today, the building houses a small museum and a shop, but the tiles and the carved wooden columns are still impressive to look at.

=== Hamza Museum ===
Built in 1989, the Hamza Museum is named after [[Hamza Hakimzade Niyazi]], a Soviet hero who was born in Kokand. Hamza was Uzbekistan's first national poet and the founder of Uzbek [[social realism]], and the museum was opened to commemorate the centenary of his birth.<ref name=":1" /> The museum houses general exhibits about life in Kokand, and also has artefacts relating to a variety of dramatists, propagandists, and writers.<ref name=":0" />

Unlike the other madrassahs in Kokand which were closed by the Soviets, the Narbutabey Madrassah remained active as a place of Quranic study until 2016.<ref name=":1" />

The last madrassah is the Dasturkahanchi Madrasa. It was built in 1833 as a school for boys, but it is now a training centre where girls learn embroidery.<ref name=":2" />
