'''Saïda''' ({{langx|ar|سعيدة}}, {{lang-Latn|ar|saʿīda}}, {{IPA|ar|saʕiːda|pron}}) is a [[communes of Algeria|commune]] and the capital city of [[Saïda Province]], [[Algeria]].

==History==
The city's site has been of military importance ever since the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] built a fort there.<ref name=":0" /> Saïda was a stronghold of [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd al-Qadir]], the Algerian national leader, who burned the town as [[Second French Empire|French]] forces approached it in 1844.<ref name=":0" />

Modern Saïda was founded as a French military outpost in 1854 and once housed a regiment of the [[French Foreign Legion]]. Its growth was stimulated by the arrival of the [[Oran]]-[[Béchar]] (narrow-gauge) railway in 1862.

In 2005 the population was 158,856 inhabitants.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} It is nicknamed ''the city of waters'', because of its abundant underground springs. The area is forested and the main products of the town are cereals, wool, leather and [[bottled water|bottled]] [[mineral water]]s.<ref name=":0" />

==Geography==
===Location===
Saïda is located in north-western Algeria, on the southern slopes of the [[Tell Atlas]] mountain range at the northern fringe of the High Plateaus. The city lies on the right bank of the [[Wadi Saïda]], protected by wooded mountains on the opposite shore that rise steeply from the valley floor to an elevation of some 4,000 feet (1,200 metres).<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Saida|title=Saïda {{!}} Algeria|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref>
