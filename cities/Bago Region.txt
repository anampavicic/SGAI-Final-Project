'''Bago Region''' ({{langx|my|ပဲခူးတိုင်းဒေသကြီး}}, {{IPA-my|bəɡó táɪɰ̃ dèθa̰ dʑí|pron}}; formerly '''Pegu Division''' and '''Bago Division''') is an [[administrative divisions of Myanmar|administrative region]] of [[Myanmar]], located in the southern central part of the country. It is bordered by [[Magway Region]] and [[Mandalay Region]] to the north; [[Kayin State]], [[Mon State]] and the [[Gulf of Martaban]] to the east; [[Yangon Region]] to the south and [[Ayeyarwady Region]] and [[Rakhine State]] to the west. It is located between 46°45'N and 19°20'N and 94°35'E and 97°10'E. It has a population of 4,867,373 (2014).

==History==
According to legend, two [[Mon people|Mon]] princes from [[Thaton]] founded the city of Bago in 573 AD. They saw a female [[Hamsa (bird)|Hamsa]] standing on the back of a male Hamsa on an island in a huge lake. Believing this was an auspicious omen, the princes built a city called [[Hanthawady]] ([[Pāli|Pali]]: Hamsavati) on the edge of the lake.

The [[Persian Empire|Persian]] geographer [[Ibn Khordadbeh]] mentions the city around 850 [[AD]]. The Mon capital was still in [[Thaton]] at that time. The Thiruvalangadu plate describe [[Rajendra Chola I]], the Chola Emperor from South India, as having conquered "Kadaram" in the fourteenth year of his reign- 1028 CE. According to one interpretation, Kadaram refers to Bago.<ref name="sastrip">{{cite book | first= K. A. Nilakanta| last=Sastri| author-link=K. A.

(1939). JAYAVARMAN VII (1181-1201 A.D.) (The last of the great monarchs of Cambodia). Proceedings of the Indian History Congress, 3, 380. Retrieved September 2, 2020, from www.jstor.org/stable/44252387</ref> The Bamar from [[Bagan]] ruled the area in 1056. After the collapse of Bagan to the [[Mongols]] in 1287, the Mon regained their independence.

From 1369 to 1539, Hanthawady was the capital of the [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom]], which covered all of what is now lower Burma. The area came under Burman control again in 1539, when it was annexed by King [[Tabinshwehti]] of [[Taungoo Dynasty|Kingdom of Taungoo]]. The kings of [[Taungoo]] made Bago their royal capital from 1539 to 1599, and used it as a base for their repeated invasions of [[Thailand|Siam]]. As a major seaport, the city was frequently visited by Europeans, who commented on its magnificence. The Burmese capital was relocated to [[Inwa|Ava]] in 1634. In 1740, the Mon revolted and briefly regained their independence, but Burmese King [[Alaungpaya]] sacked and completely destroyed the city (along with Mon independence) in 1757.

Burmese King [[Bodawpaya]] (1782–1819) rebuilt Bago, but by then the river had shifted course, cutting the city off from the sea. It never regained its previous importance. After the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]], the [[British Empire|British]] annexed Bago in 1852. In 1862, with the formation of the province of [[British Burma]], the capital was moved to [[Yangon]].

The division's economy is strongly dependent on the timber trade. Taungoo, in the northern end of the Bago Region, is bordered by mountain ranges, home to [[teak]] and other hardwoods. Another natural resource is petroleum. The major crop is rice, occupying over two-thirds of the available agricultural land. Other major crops include [[betel nut]], [[sugarcane]], maize, [[peanut|groundnut]], [[sesamum]], [[sunflower]], [[beans]] and [[pulses]], cotton, jute, rubber, tobacco, [[tapioca]], banana, [[Nipa palm]] and toddy. Industry includes fisheries, salt, [[ceramic]]s, sugar, paper, [[plywood]], distilleries, and [[monosodium glutamate]].

The division has a small livestock breeding and fisheries sector, and a small industrial sector. In 2005, it had over 4 million farm animals; nearly {{convert|3000|acre|ha|order=flip}} of fish and prawn farms; and about 3000 private factories and about 100 state owned factories.<ref name=usda/>

The major tourist sites of the Bago Region can be reached as a day trip from Yangon.
