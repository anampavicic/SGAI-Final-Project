It is divided into [[municipalities of Quintana Roo|11 municipalities]], and its capital city is [[Chetumal]].

Quintana Roo is located on the eastern part of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] and is bordered by the states of [[Campeche]] to the west and [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] to the northwest, and by the [[Orange Walk District|Orange Walk]] and [[Corozal District|Corozal]] districts of [[Belize]], along with an offshore borderline with [[Belize District]] to the south.

Quintana Roo is the home of the city of [[Cancún]], the islands of [[Cozumel]] and [[Isla Mujeres]], and the towns of [[Bacalar]], [[Playa del Carmen]] and [[Akumal]], as well as the ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]] ruins of [[Chacchoben]], [[Cobá]], [[Kohunlich]], [[Muyil]], [[Tulum]], [[Xel-Há]], [[San Gervasio (Maya site)|San Gervasio]] and [[Xcaret]].  The [[Sian Ka'an]] [[Man and the Biosphere Programme|biosphere reserve]] is also located in the state. The statewide population is expanding at a rapid rate due to the construction of hotels and the demand for workers. Many migrants come from [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]], [[Campeche]], [[Tabasco]], and [[Veracruz]]. The state is frequently hit by severe [[hurricanes]] due to its exposed location, the most recent and severe being [[Hurricane Dean]] in 2007, which made landfall with sustained winds of {{convert|280|km/h|abbr=on}}, with gusts up to {{convert|320|km/h|abbr=on}}.

==History==
{{see also| Territory of Quintana Roo}}
[[File:Templo del dios viento.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Tulum]] - Temple of the Wind God]]

The area that makes up modern Quintana Roo was long part of Yucatán, sharing its history. With the [[Caste War of Yucatán]], which started in the 1840s, all non-natives were driven from the region. The independent [[Maya people|Maya]] nation of [[Chan Santa Cruz]] was based on what is now the town of [[Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Quintana Roo|Felipe Carrillo Puerto]]. For decades, it maintained considerable independence, having separate trade and treaty relationships with British Honduras, now [[Belize]].

The [[Territory of Quintana Roo]] was created by decree of President [[Porfirio Díaz]] on November 24, 1902. It was named after an early patriot of the Mexican Republic, [[Andrés Quintana Roo]]. The Mexican [[Federal Army]] succeeded in subjugating most of the indigenous Maya population of the region during the 1910s. In 1913, the area was again declared to be legally part of the state of Yucatán, but was again declared a separate territory in 1915. The territory of Quintana Roo was granted statehood within the United Mexican States on October 8, 1974.<ref name="poder"/>

In the last quarter of the 20th century and continuing into the 21st, Quintana Roo developed rapidly, with tourism being a driving force, notably with the development of [[Cancún]].

=== Archaeological findings ===
Ancient human remains have been discovered in a system of submerged caves and sinkholes in the [[Tulum]] area of Quintana Roo. To date, a total of nine skeletons have been found in these caves, including one of the oldest human skeletons found on the American continent. In 2016, underwater archaeological exploration of a cave known as [[Chan Hol]] found a skeleton of a female who lived in the region at least 9,900 years ago, during the [[History of Mesoamerica (Paleo-Indian)|Paleo-Indian period]]. Dating revealed that the skeleton was probably about 30 years old at the time of death. Three different scars on the skull of the woman showed that she was hit with something hard and her skull bones were broken. Her skull also had crater-like deformations and tissue deformities that appeared to be caused by a bacterial relative of [[syphilis]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stinnesbeck |first1=Wolfgang |last2=Rennie |first2=Samuel R. |last3=Olguín |first3=Jerónimo Avilés |last4=Stinnesbeck |first4=Sarah R. |last5=Gonzalez |first5=Silvia |last6=Frank |first6=Norbert |last7=Warken |first7=Sophie |last8=Schorndorf |first8=Nils |last9=Krengel |first9=Thomas |last10=Morlet |first10=Adriana Velázquez |last11=González |first11=Arturo González |title=New evidence for an early settlement of the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico: The Chan Hol 3 woman and her meaning for the Peopling of the Americas |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=e0227984 |date=February 5, 2020 |issn=1932-6203 |pmid=32023279 |pmc=7001910 |bibcode=2020PLoSO..1527984S |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0227984 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

According to study lead researcher Wolfgang Stinnesbeck, "It really looks as if this woman had a very hard time and an extremely unhappy end of her life. Obviously, this is speculative, but given the traumas and the pathological deformations on her skull, it appears a likely scenario that she may have been expelled from her group and was killed in the cave, or was left in the cave to die there”.<ref name=Geggel>{{cite web |last1=Geggel |first1=Laura |title=9,900-year-old skeleton of horribly disfigured woman found in Mexican cave |url=https://www.livescience.com/early-american-underwater-cave.html |website=Live Science |publisher=Future US Inc |access-date=17 May 2023 |date=February 5, 2020}}</ref>

The skeleton found by the 2016 exploration was {{convert|140|m|yd|-1|abbr=on}} away from a site where a previous expedition found human remains known as Chan Hol 2. Although archaeologists assumed the 2016 expedition had rediscovered Chan Hol 2, Stinnesbeck concluded that the two skeletons represent different individuals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scitechdaily.com/9900-year-old-skeleton-discovered-in-submerged-mexican-cave-has-a-distinctive-skull/|title=9,900-Year-Old Skeleton Discovered in Submerged Mexican Cave Has a Distinctive Skull|last=PLOS|date=February 5, 2020|website=SciTechDaily|language=en-US|access-date=March 19, 2020}}</ref>

Due to their distinctive features, study co-researcher Samuel Rennie suggest the existence of at least two morphologically diverse groups of people living separately in [[Mexico]] during the transition from [[Pleistocene]] to [[Holocene]].<ref name=Geggel/>[[File:Cancun Strand Luftbild (22179809191).jpg|250px|thumb|The city of [[Cancún]] is a major tourist resort in Quintana Roo]]

===Biotic situation of the Yucatán Peninsula===
The Yucatán Peninsula is one of the most forested areas of the world in terms of biotic mass per hectare.  However, anthropological, biological and governmental experts have determined that Quintana Roo is 'facing a faunal crisis'.<ref name="anderson"/>  Many medium to large game animals are disappearing due to [[hunting]] and [[habitat loss]]. While its population is relatively small, Quintana Roo is experiencing both a population influx and an increase in tourism.<ref name="anderson"/><ref name="brit"/> This only increases the pressure on the plants and animals native to the area.

===Ecosystems and animals===
There are four generalized [[ecosystem]]s in Quintana Roo—[[tropical forests]], or [[jungle]]; [[savanna]], [[mangrove]] forests, and [[coral reefs]].  One of the byproducts of traditional and large-scale [[agriculture]] is the creation of additional habitats, such as second growth [[forests]] and fields/[[pasture]]s.<ref name="villa">Villa Rojas, Alfonso.  1945.  The Maya
 of East Central Quintana Roo.  Carnegie Institute of Washington Publication 559.  Washington D.C.</ref>  Tourism has caused Quintana Roo to become famous around the world in the last thirty or so years for its [[beaches]], [[coastline]], and [[cenote]] sinkholes.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chandler|first1=Gary|title=Tulum Beaches and Cenotes|url=https://moon.com/2014/03/tulum-beaches-and-cenotes/|website=Moon Guides|date=March 10, 2014|access-date=December 24, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cenotes|url=https://www.afar.com/places/cenotes-quintana-roo|website=Afar|access-date=December 24, 2017}}</ref> Biological experts consider the coastline of Quintana Roo one of the best [[manatee]] habitats worldwide.<ref name="schlesinger">Schlesinger, Victoria.  2001.

"Ecological Degradation, Global Tourism, and Inequality: Maya Interpretations of the Changing Environment in Quintana Roo, Mexico.  ''Human Organization'' 61.2, 113-124.</ref>

===Birds===
Also affected by the loss of habitat due to both agriculture and development, [[birds]] are one of the region's most varied animal assets.<ref name="anderson"/>  Hundreds of species reside in Quintana Roo permanently, with hundreds of others either wintering there or using it as a stopover on the long journey into [[South America]].<ref name="schlesinger"/>  As a result, many birders come to the area annually in search of the rare and unexpected.<ref name="anderson"/>

The [[Riviera Maya]] is located along the [[Caribbean]] coastline, including [[Cancún]], [[Playa del Carmen]], [[Puerto Morelos]], [[Akumal]] and [[Cozumel]].

There are a number of Mayan archeological sites in Quintana Roo, including [[Chacchoben]], [[Coba]], [[Kohunlich]], [[Muyil]], [[San Gervasio (Maya site)|San Gervasio]], [[Tulum]], [[Xcaret]], [[Xelha]], and [[Yo'okop]].

Projections for the tourism economy of Quintana Roo have been optimistic, based on multiple attractions, from the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] ruins to the lush forests and beautiful beaches.  However, long-term problems include the effect on the local environment, economic stresses of development and population,<ref name="juarez"/> and "[[economic]] [[marginalization]]" of the Maya natives.<ref name="daltabuit"/>

==Time zone==
On February 1, 2015, Quintana Roo officially adopted a new time zone, Southeastern, which is five hours behind [[Coordinated Universal Time]] ([[UTC−05:00]]). Quintana Roo does not observe [[Daylight saving time|daylight saving]] time, so Southeastern Time is constant throughout the year. Southeastern Time (ST) is the same as Eastern Standard Time (EST) and Central Daylight Time (CDT). This means that in the winter, Quintana Roo has the same time as regions observing EST, such as the eastern U.S., eastern Canada, Cuba, and Jamaica; and in the summer, Quintana Roo has the same time as regions observing CDT, such as central Mexico.<ref name="eluniversal.com.mx">{{cite web|title=Quintana Roo estrena horario mañana (Spanish)|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/estados/2015/quintana-roo-estrena-horario-maniana-1073452.html|access-date=February 1, 2015|language=es}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mexico's Quintana Roo Gears Up for Feb. 1 Time Change|url=http://www.travelpulse.com/news/destinations/mexicos-quintana-roo-gears-up-for-feb-1-time-change.html|website=TravelPulse|access-date=February 10, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Haynes|first1=Danielle|title=Cancun switches to Eastern time zone|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2015/01/29/Cancun-switches-to-Eastern-time-zone/7591422575975/|access-date=February 10, 2015|agency=UPI|date=January 29, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cancun Region Gets Longer Evenings|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/mexico-quintana-roo-time-zone.html|website=Time and Date|access-date=February 10, 2015|date=January 14, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Boletín 266 .- Celebra SECTUR reforma a ley del sistema de horario en los Estados Unidos Mexicanos|url=http://www.sectur.gob.mx/2014/12/06/boletin-266-celebra-sectur-reforma-a-ley-del-sistema-de-horario-en-los-estados-unidos-mexicanos/|website=Mexican Ministry of Tourism|access-date=March 8, 2015|language=es}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=DECRETO por el que se reforman los artículos 2 y 3 de la Ley del Sistema de Horario en los Estados Unidos Mexicanos|url=http://dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5380123&fecha=31/01/2015|website=Official Journal of the Federation|publisher=Mexican Interior Ministry|access-date=March 8, 2015|language=es}}</ref>

Quintana Roo changed to Southeastern Time for economic reasons, including:

* Allowing tourists in areas such as Cancún, Cozumel, and Playa del Carmen to spend more time (and money) at beaches, restaurants, historic sites, and other venues.
* Reducing electricity usage by hotels, restaurants, and other facilities.

Before Quintana Roo adopted the Southeastern time zone (officially referred to as ''zona sureste'' in Mexico), it had been part of the Central time zone (''zona centro'').
