'''Krasnodar Krai''' ({{langx|ru|Краснода́рский край|Krasnodarskiy kray}}, {{IPA-all|krəsnɐˈdarskʲɪj kraj}}) is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (a [[krai]]), located in the [[North Caucasus]] region in [[Southern Russia]] and administratively a part of the [[Southern Federal District]]. Its [[administrative center]] is the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Krasnodar]]. The [[List of federal subjects of Russia by population|third most populous]] federal subject, the krai had a population of&nbsp;5,838,273 as of the [[Russian Census (2021)|2021 Census]].<ref name="2021Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2021Census}}</ref>

Krasnodar Krai is formally and informally referred to as '''Kuban''' ({{langx|ru|Кубань}}), a term denoting the historical region of [[Kuban]] situated between the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Kuban River]] which is mostly composed of the krai's territory. It is bordered by [[Rostov Oblast]] to the north, [[Stavropol Krai]] to the east, [[Karachay-Cherkessia]] to the south-east, and [[Adygea]] is an [[enclave]] entirely within the krai. Krasnodar Krai shares an international border with [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and the partially-recognized republic of [[Abkhazia]] to the south, and borders [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexed]] [[Crimea]] to the west, across the [[Kerch Strait]].

The northern part of the krai belongs to the [[Don Steppe]], while the southern region's [[Mediterranean climate]] has made it a popular tourist location. [[Novorossiysk]] is Russia's main port on the Black Sea, one of the few cities awarded the title of the [[Hero City (Soviet Union)|Hero City]],
and [[Sochi]] was the host of the [[XXII Olympic Winter Games]] in 2014. Krasnodar Krai is home to significant infrastructure of the [[Russian Navy]]'s [[Black Sea Fleet]].

==History==
[[File:Phanagoria excavations (2008).JPG|thumb|[[Phanagoria]], ancient Greek city and former capital of early medieval [[Old Great Bulgaria]]]]
The region's earliest known inhabitants are referred to, generally, as the [[Maeotians|''Maiōtai'']], who are the ancestors of the modern-day [[Circassians]], [[Abkhazians]] and [[Abazins]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Адыги – Энциклопедия, Большая Советская |url=http://gatchina3000.ru/big/002/515_bolshaya-sovetskaya.htm |access-date=2023-03-11 |website=gatchina3000.ru}}</ref> (after the Greek name for the [[Maeotian Swamp|Sea of Azov]]). During the 6th century BC, [[Pontic Greeks]] founded the area's first cities, such as ''[[Phanagoria]]'' (near modern [[Sennoy, Krasnodar Krai|Sennoy]]) and ''[[Hermonassa]]'' (on the [[Taman Peninsula]]), who traded with nomadic tribes including the [[Scythians|''Skuthai'']] (Scythians) and [[Sindi people|''Sindi'']].

In the 7th century, Phanagoria served as the capital of [[Old Great Bulgaria]]. From the 8th to the 10th centuries, the area was dominated by the [[Khazars]], a [[Turkic people]] who had earlier migrated from the east onto the [[Pontic-Caspian Steppe]], where [[Khazar_hypothesis_of_Ashkenazi_ancestry|a hypothesis claims that they converted]] to [[Judaism]].  After the defeat of the [[Khazar Khanate]] in 965 [[Grand Prince of Kiev|Kievan Prince]] [[Svyatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatoslav]] conquered the area, it came under the rule of [[Kievan Rus']], and it then formed the [[Tmutarakan]] principality. Later, due to the increasing claims of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] at the end of the 11th century, the Tmutarakan principality came under the authority of the Eastern Roman Emperors (until 1204).{{cn|date=June 2021}}

In that period of history, the [[Circassians]] were first mentioned, under the ethnonym ''[[Kassogs]]''. For example, the [[Kassoges|Kassog]] Prince [[Rededya]] was mentioned in ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Song of Igor's Campaign, Igor son of Svyatoslav and grandson of Oleg |url=http://lib.ru/NABOKOW/slovo.txt |access-date=2023-03-11 |website=lib.ru}}</ref>

In 1243–1438, the current territory of the Kuban was part of the [[Golden Horde]]. After the latter's collapse, parts of Kuban were held under the [[Crimean Khanate]], [[Circassia]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]], which dominated the region. The [[Tsardom of Russia]] began to challenge the protectorate of the Ottoman Empire in the area during the [[History of the Russo-Turkish wars|Russo-Turkish wars]].

[[File:Krasnodar Krai map-en.svg|right|thumb|Krasnodar Krai]]

In April 1783, after the liquidation of the [[Crimean Khanate]], right-bank Kuban and Taman Peninsula were annexed to the [[Russian Empire]] by decree of [[Catherine II]]. In 1792–1794, the [[Cossacks]] moved there from [[Zaporizhzhia]], now located in Ukraine, and formed the Black Sea Area troops, with the creation of a solid cordon line for the [[Kuban River]] and [[Circassian genocide|the marginalization]] of the neighboring [[Circassians]]. The administrative region was accorded the status of "Land of Black Sea Cossack Army", with its center in the city of [[Yekaterinodar]] (renamed Krasnodar by the Bolsheviks in 1920).

In 1900, the region's population numbered around two million people. In 1913, the gross grain harvest Kuban region entered second place in Russia, for the production of marketable grain – in first place.{{clarify|date=May 2020}} During the [[Russian Civil War]], the anti-communist [[Kuban People's Republic]] was established on 28 January 1918. It sought union with the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] during its brief independence until Soviet forces occupied the latter in May 1920.

Krasnodar Krai was founded on 13 September 1937, when [[Azov-Black Sea Krai]] of the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Russian SFSR]] was split up in Krasnodar Krai and [[Rostov Oblast]]. The [[Greek Autonomous District]] and [[Shapsug National District]] were located within the Krai. On 30 January 1996 Krasnodar Krai signed a power-sharing agreement with the federal government, granting it autonomy.<ref name="asymmetries">{{Cite journal|last=Solnick|first=Steven|date=29 May 1996|title=Asymmetries in Russian Federation Bargaining|url=https://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/1996-810-08-Solnick.pdf|journal=The National Council for Soviet and East European Research|pages=12}}</ref> This agreement would be abolished on 12 April 2002.<ref name="demokratiztsiya">{{Cite journal|last=Chuman|first=Mizuki|title=The Rise and Fall of Power-Sharing Treaties Between Center and Regions in Post-Soviet Russia|url=http://demokratizatsiya.pub/archives/19_2_L7H017206G216817.pdf|journal=Demokratizatsiya|pages=146}}</ref>

==Politics==
[[File:Krasnodar 002.JPG|thumb|Krai Administration building in Krasnodar]]

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the krai was shared between three persons: the first secretary of the Krasnodar CPSU Committee (who in reality had the greatest authority), the chairman of the Krai Soviet (legislative power), and the chairman of the Krai Executive Committee (executive power). In 1991, the CPSU lost power, and the head of the krai administration, and eventually the governor have been since appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of Krasnodar Krai is the fundamental law of the region. The [[Legislative Assembly of Krasnodar Krai]] is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the krai government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day-to-day matters of the province. The krai administration supports the governor's activities, who is the highest official and acts as the guarantor of the observance of the Krai Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Krasnodar Krai}}

Krasnodar Krai is administratively divided into thirty-eight [[raion|districts]] (''raions'') and fifteen [[city of federal subject significance|cities of district equivalence]]. The districts and cities are further subdivided into eleven [[town of district significance|towns]], plus [[urban-type settlement of district significance|urban-type settlements]], and [[selsoviet|rural okrugs and stanitsa okrugs]].

==Economy==

As a result of [[2014 Winter Olympics]], Krasnodar Krai has seen significant infrastructure spending.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Filipov |first1=David |title=Russia spent $50 billion on the Sochi Olympics. |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/that-sochi-olympic-boondoggle-russians-say-all-the-investment-is-paying-off/2017/11/13/65014bd0-b82c-11e7-9b93-b97043e57a22_story.html |access-date=4 February 2020 |newspaper=The Washington Post}}</ref> Over $50&nbsp;billion has been spent on various infrastructure projects including a bullet train. 

Large companies in the region include [[Magnit|Tander]], Novorossmetal, Autonomous Heat Energy Company, Gazprom gas distribution Krasnodar, and Evrokhim Chemical Fertilizers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Krasnodar Territory Industries |url=https://www.investinregions.ru/en/regions/krasnodarsky/industries/ |website=investinregions.ru |access-date=7 November 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

===Transportation===
Several lines of [[Russian Railways]] cross the region and link it with [[Abkhazia]], [[Ukraine]], and neighboring Russian regions. There are direct trains from resort cities like [[Sochi]] and [[Anapa]] to [[Moscow]], via [[Krasnodar]], which become very popular during the summer vacation season. There are also suburb train connections.
The [[Apsheronsk narrow-gauge railway]], the longest [[Mountain railway|mountain]] [[narrow gauge railway|narrow-gauge railway]] in Russia, runs through Krasnodar Krai.

There are several airports in the region, including [[Krasnodar International Airport]], [[Sochi International Airport]], [[Anapa Airport]], and [[Gelendzhik Airport]].

The population of Krasnodar Krai is concentrated in the [[Kuban River]] drainage basin, which was traditionally [[Cossack]] land (see'' [[History of Cossacks]]''). The [[Kuban Cossacks]] are now generally considered{{according to whom|date=October 2022}} to be ethnic Russians, even though they are still an important minority in their own right in the area. [[Kuban Cossacks#National identity|Historically]], they were considered to be ethnic Ukrainian{{according to whom|date=October 2022}}, and reported their language as Ukrainian in censuses well into the 20th century (see [[Kuban Cossacks#National identity|''National Identity of Kuban Cossacks'']]). This change in identity is due to assimilation and historical persecution of the Kuban Cossacks, which was particularly prominent due to questions of their loyalty to Moscow and the Communist state during the Russian Revolution and First World War.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

Other notable ethnic groups include the [[Adyghe people|Adyghe]], who are the region's indigenous population and were nearly completely annihilated following the [[Circassian genocide]],<ref name="RLS">{{cite book |last1=Richard |first1=Walter |title=The Circassian Genocide |date=9 April 2013 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-6069-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LHlwZwpA70cC}}</ref> and the [[Armenians]] (including Christian [[Hamsheni]] and [[Cherkesogai]]), who have lived in the region since at least the 18th century.{{cn|date=October 2022}}
