'''Banten''' ({{langx|id|Banten}}, {{langx|su|{{Sund|ᮘᮔ᮪ᮒᮨᮔ᮪}}|Banten}}) is the westernmost [[Provinces of Indonesia|province]] on the island of [[Java]], [[Indonesia]]. Its capital city is [[Serang]] and its largest city is [[Tangerang]]. The province borders [[West Java]] and the [[Special Capital Region of Batavia|Special Capital Region of Jakarta]] on the east, the [[Java Sea]] on the north, the [[Indian Ocean]] on the south, and the [[Sunda Strait]] (which separates Java from the neighbouring island of [[Sumatra]]) on the west and shares a maritime border with  [[Lampung]] to the west. The province covers an area of {{cvt|9,352.77|km2}}. It had a population of over 11.9 million in the [[2020 Indonesian census|2020 census]],<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> up from about 10.6 million in [[2010 Indonesian census|2010]].<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> The estimated mid-2023 population was 12.308 million.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Provinsi Banten Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.36)</ref> Formerly part of the province of [[West Java]], Banten was split off to become a province on 17 October 2000. 

The northern half (particularly the eastern areas near Jakarta and the Java Sea coast) has recently experienced rapid rises in population and [[Urbanization in Indonesia|urbanization]], and the southern half (especially the region facing the [[Indian Ocean]]) has a more traditional character but an equally fast-rising population.

Present-day Banten was part of the Sundanese [[Tarumanagara|Tarumanagara kingdom]] from the fourth to the seventh centuries AD. After the fall of Tarumanegara, it was controlled by [[Hindus|Hindu]]-[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] kingdoms such as the [[Srivijaya]] Empire and the [[Sunda Kingdom]]. The [[Spread of Islam in Indonesia|spread of Islam]] in the region began in the 15th century; by the late 16th century, [[Islam]] had replaced Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religion in the province, with the establishment of the [[Banten Sultanate]]. European traders began arriving in the region{{snd}}first the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], followed by the [[British people|British]] and the [[Dutch people|Dutch]]. The [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) finally controlled the regional economy, gradually weakening the Banten Sultanate. On 22 November 1808, Dutch [[Governor-general of the Dutch East Indies|Governor-General]] [[Herman Willem Daendels]] declared that the Sultanate of Banten had been absorbed into the [[Dutch East Indies]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Ekspedisi Anjer-Panaroekan, Laporan Jurnalistik Kompas|date=November 2008|publisher=Penerbit Buku Kompas, PT Kompas Media Nusantara, Jakarta Indonesia|isbn=978-979-709-391-4|pages=1–2}}</ref> This began the [[Bantam Residency]], 150 years of direct Dutch rule. In March 1942, the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] invaded the Indies and [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|occupied the region]] for three years before their August 1945 [[Surrender of Japan|surrender]]. The region was returned to Dutch control for the next five years before the Dutch left and it was ruled by the [[Government of Indonesia|Indonesian government]]. Banten  became part of the province of West Java, but separatist efforts led to the creation of the separate province of Banten in 2000.<ref name="Britannica2">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Banten|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|first=Virginia|last=Gorlinski|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Banten-province-Indonesia}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name "Banten" has several possible origins. The first is from the [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] phrase ''katiban inten,'' which means "struck down by diamonds". The phrase comes from the history of the [[Bantenese people]], who were [[Animism|animists]] before adopting [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. After [[Islam]] began to spread in Banten, the community began to recognize and embrace Islam. The spread of Islam in Banten is described as being "struck down by diamonds".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Banten|first=BPCB|date=2017-02-28|title=Banten, arti kata dan toponimi|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpcbbanten/banten-arti-kata-dan-toponimi/|access-date=2019-03-16|website=Balai Pelestarian Cagar Budaya Banten|language=en-US}}</ref>

Another origin story is that the [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Indonesian Hindu]] god [[Batara Guru]] traveled from east to west, arriving at Surasowan (present-day [[Serang]]). When he arrived, Batara Guru sat on a stone which became known as ''watu gilang''. The stone glowed, and was presented to the king of Surasowan. Surasowan was reportedly surrounded by a clear, star-like river, and was described as a ring covered with diamonds ([[Sundanese language|Sundanese]]: ''ban inten''). This evolved into "banten".<ref name=":0" />

Another possibility is that "Banten" comes from the [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] word ''bantahan'' (rebuttal), because the local Bantenese people resisted the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]].<ref name=":0" /> The word "Banten" appeared before the establishment of the [[Banten Sultanate]] as the [[Ci Banten|name of a river]]. The high plains on its banks were called ''Cibanten Girang'', shortened to ''Banten Girang'' (Upper Banten). Based on research in Banten Girang, the area has been settled since the 11th and 12th centuries.<ref>Guillot, Claude, Lukman Nurhakim, Sonny Wibisono, "La principauté de Banten Girang", ''Archipel'', 1995, Volume 50, No. 50, pp. 13-24.</ref> During the 16th century, the region developed rapidly towards Serang and the northern coast. The coastal area later became the Sultanate of Banten, founded by [[Sunan Gunungjati|Sunan Gunung Jati]], which controlled almost all of the former [[Sunda Kingdom]] in West Java. [[Sunda Kelapa]] ([[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]) was captured by the Dutch, and [[Cirebon]] and the [[Parahyangan|Parahiyangan]] region were captured by the [[Mataram Sultanate]]. The Banten Sultanate was later converted into a [[Administrative divisions of the Dutch East Indies|residency]] by the Dutch.<ref name=":0" />

During the fifth century, Banten was part of the kingdom of [[Tarumanagara]]. The fourth-century [[Cidanghiang inscription|Lebak inscription]], discovered in 1947 in a lowland village on the Cidanghiyang River in {{ILL|Munjul, Pandeglang|id}}, contains two lines of [[Sanskrit]] poetry in the [[Pallawa script]]<ref>OV (Oudheidkundige Verslag) 1949; 1950:20</ref> which describes life in the kingdom under the reign of [[Purnawarman]].<ref name="Soekmono">{{Cite book |last=Soekmono |first=Raden |title=Pengantar Sejarah Kebudayaan Indonesia |date=1973 |publisher=Kanisius |isbn=9794131741 |edition=5th reprint |location=Yogyakarta |pages=36  |oclc=884261720}}</ref> The kingdom collapsed after an attack by [[Srivijaya]], and western Java became part of the [[Sunda Kingdom]]. In the Chinese ''[[Chu-fan-chi]]'', written around 1225, [[Chou Ju-kua]] wrote that Srivijaya ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java during the early 13th century. ''Chu-fan-chi'' identified the port of Sunda as strategic and thriving, with [[Black pepper|pepper]] from Sunda among the highest quality. The population were made up of farmers, and their houses were built on wooden poles (''rumah panggung''). Robbery, however, was common.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Soekmono |first=Raden |title=Pengantar Sejarah Kebudayaan Indonesia |date=1973 |publisher=Kanisius |isbn=9794131741 |edition=5th reprint |location=Yogyakarta |pages=60 |oclc=884261720}}</ref>

According to Portuguese explorer [[Tome Pires]], Bantam ([[Banten (town)|Banten]]) was an important early-16th-century port in the Kingdom of Sunda along with the ports of [[Pontang]], Cheguide (Cigede), Tangaram ([[Tangerang]]), Calapa ([[Sunda Kelapa]]) and Chimanuk (on the [[Manuk River|Cimanuk river]] estuary).<ref>{{cite book|title=Sumber-sumber asli sejarah Jakarta, Jilid I: Dokumen-dokumen sejarah Jakarta sampai dengan akhir abad ke-16|last=Heuken|first=A.| publisher=Cipta Loka Caraka| year=1999| page=34}}</ref> In 1527, as the Portuguese fleet arrived off the coast, newly-converted [[Javanese people|Javanese]] [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslims]] under [[Sunan Gunungjati]] captured the port of Banten and the surrounding area from the Sundanese and established the [[Sultanate of Banten]]. According to Portuguese historian [[João de Barros]], [[Old Banten|Banten]] was the center of the sultanate and a major [[Southeast Asia]]n port (rivaling [[Malacca]] and [[Makassar]]). The town of Banten was in the middle of the bay, about {{cvt|3|mi}} across. It was 850 [[fathom]]s in length. A river, navigable by [[Djong (ship)|junks]], flowed through the center of the town; a small tributary extended to the town's edge. The present-day river is smaller, and only navigable by small boats. A fortress near the town had brick walls seven [[Palm (unit)|palms]] thick. Armed, wooden defence buildings were two stories high. The town square was used for military activities and folk art, with a market in the morning. The palace was on the south side of the square. Next to the palace is a tall, flat-roofed building known as Srimanganti, which was used by the king to meet his subjects. West of the square is the [[Great Mosque of Banten]].{{fact|date=September 2024}}

When the Dutch arrived in Indonesia, the Portuguese had long been in Banten. The English established a [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Banten, followed by the Dutch. The French and the Danish also came to trade in Banten. In the competition among European traders, the Dutch emerged victorious. The Portuguese left Banten in 1601 after their fleet was destroyed by the Dutch off the coast during the [[Dutch–Portuguese War]].{{citation needed|date=August 2024}}

In 16th century, Chinese junk ships regularly traded with Jambi, Patani, Siam and Cambodia.<ref>{{cite book |last= |first= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BjHgDwAAQBAJ&dq=jambi+dutch+siamese+junks&pg=PT83 |title=European Commercial Expansion in Early Modern Asia |date=2020 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-351-93871-6 |editor-last=Prakash |editor-first=Om |series=An Expanding World: The European Impact on World History, 1450 to 1800 |location= |page= |quote=...

Although the Dutch won the war, they preserved the [[Banten Sultanate]]. The maritime sultanate relied on trade, and the pepper monopoly in [[Lampung]] made the Banten authorities intermediaries.

During their [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|three years of occupation]], the Japanese built the [[Saketi–Bayah railway]] in southern [[Lebak Regency|Lebak]] to transport [[brown coal]] from the Bayah mines.

After [[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]] in August 1945, the Dutch East Indies [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|declared independence]] as the Republic of Indonesia. This was opposed by the returning Dutch, resulting in the [[Indonesian war of independence]]. During the war, Banten remained under Indonesian control. On 26 February 1948, the State of West Java ({{langx|id|Negara Jawa Barat}}, {{langx|su|Negara Jawa Kulon}}) was established; on 24 April 1948, it was renamed [[State of Pasundan|Pasundan]]. Pasundan became a [[Federated state|federal state]] of the [[United States of Indonesia]] in 1949, and was incorporated into the [[Republic of Indonesia (1949–1950)|Republic of Indonesia]] on 11 March 1950.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/id-4550.html|title = United States of Indonesia}}</ref>

After Indonesian independence, Banten became part of the province of [[West Java]].

It is near the [[Sunda Strait]]'s sea lanes, which link [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] with [[Southeast Asia]]. Banten also links [[Java]] and Sumatra. The region has a number of industries; its seaports handle overflow cargo from the seaport in [[Jakarta]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnnindonesia.com/ekonomi/20180511163459-92-297471/pemprov-banten-ajukan-enam-pelabuhan-pembantu-tanjung-priok|title=Pemprov Banten Ajukan Enam Pelabuhan 'Pembantu' Tanjung Priok|last=Deslatama|first=Yandhi|website=ekonomi|location=[[Jakarta]]|publisher=[[CNN Indonesia]]|language=id|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref> and are intended to be an alternative to the [[Port of Singapore]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://redaksiindonesia.com/read/banten-dan-lampung-bakal-jadi-pelabuhan-penting-internasional.html|title=Banten dan Lampung Bakal Jadi Pelabuhan Penting Internasional|date=2015-10-18|website=Redaksi Indonesia {{!}} Jernih – Tajam – Mencerahkan|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref>

Its location on the western tip of Java makes Banten the gateway to Java, [[Sumatra]] and the adjacent areas of Jakarta, Indonesia's capital.

[[File:Rawa Danau Banten Indonesia.jpg|thumb|alt=Lowlands, with mountains in the background under a cloudy sky|Rawa Danau, Serang Regency]]
The province ranges in altitude from sea level to {{cvt|2000|m}}. Banten is primarily lowland (below 50 metres above sea level) in [[Cilegon]], [[Tangerang]], [[Pandeglang Regency]], and most of [[Serang Regency]]. The central [[Lebak Regency|Lebak]] and Pandeglang Regencies range from {{cvt|201|to|2000|m}}, and the eastern Lebak Regency ranges in altitude from {{cvt|501|to|2000|m}} at the summit of [[Mount Halimun]].

Banten's [[geomorphology]] generally consists of lowlands and sloping and steep hills.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bantenprov.go.id/profil-provinsi/geografi|title=Geografi – Profil Provinsi|author=Dokumen Rencana Pembangunan Daerah|website=Website Resmi Pemerintah Provinsi Banten|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref> The lowlands are generally in the north and south.

=== Climate ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2022}}
[[File:Banten Province Map.png|thumb|alt=See caption|Administrative map of Banten]]
Banten's climate is influenced by the [[Monsoon of South Asia|South]] and [[East Asian Monsoon]]s and the alternating [[La Niña]] or [[El Niño]]. During the rainy season, the weather is dominated by a west wind (from [[Sumatra]] and the [[Indian Ocean]] south of the [[Indian subcontinent]]) joined by winds from [[North Asia|Northern Asia]] crossing the [[South China Sea]]. The dry season is dominated by an east wind which gives Banten severe droughts, especially on the northern coast during El Niño. Temperatures on the coast and in the hills range from {{cvt|22|to|32|°C}}, and temperatures in the mountains from {{cvt|400|to|1350|m}} above sea level range from {{cvt|18|to|29|°C}}.

The heaviest rainfall ranges from {{cvt|2712|to|3670|mm}} during the rainy season from September to May, covering half of the western [[Pandeglang Regency]]. Rainfall from {{cvt|335|to|453|mm}} covers half of [[Tangerang Regency]], the northern [[Serang Regency]], and the cities of [[Cilegon]] and [[Tangerang]]. In the dry season (from April to December), the peak rainfall of {{cvt|615|to|833|mm}} covers half of the northern Serang and Tangerang Regencies and the cities of Cilegon and Tangerang. The lowest dry-season rainfall, {{cvt|360|to|486|mm}} from June to September, covers half of the southern Tangerang Regency and 15 percent of southeastern Serang Regency.

[[File:Cina Benteng wedding.jpg|thumb|alt=Several couples dressed in red, black and green|Mass [[Benteng people|Benteng]] wedding ceremony]]
The [[Bantenese people]] are the largest group in the province, forming 47% of the total population. They mostly inhabit the central and southern part of the province. The origins of the Bantenese people; which are closely related to the [[Banten Sultanate]], are different from the [[Cirebonese people]] whom are not part of the [[Sundanese people]] nor the [[Javanese people]] (unless it is from the result of a mixture of two major cultures, namely Sundanese and Javanese). The Bantenese people along with the [[Baduy people]] (Kanekes) are essentially a subdivision of the [[Sundanese people]] which occupies the former region of the [[Banten Sultanate]] (region of Bantam Residency after the abolishment and annexation by the [[Dutch East Indies]]). Only after the formation of the [[Banten Province]] did people began to regard the Bantenese as a group of people with a culture and language of their own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kebudayaanindonesia.net/kebudayaan/1113/suku-banten|title=Suku Banten|date=26 August 2013|publisher=Kebudayaan Indonesia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322014235/http://kebudayaanindonesia.net/kebudayaan/1113/suku-banten|archive-date=22 March 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=2017-03-22}}</ref>

Most of the north Banten population is [[Javanese people|Javanese]]. Most of the Javanese are migrants from central and eastern Java. The [[Betawi people]] live in [[greater Jakarta]], including [[Tangerang]]. [[Chinese Indonesians]] may also be found in urban areas, also primarily in the greater Jakarta area.

=== {{anchor|Martial arts|Pencak Silat}}Pencak silat ===

[[Pencak silat]] is a group of martial arts, rooted in [[Culture of Indonesia|Indonesian culture]], which reportedly existed throughout the archipelago since the seventh century. It began to be recorded when it was influenced by the ''[[ulama]]s'' during the spread of Islam in the 15th century. At that time, martial arts were taught with religious studies in ''[[pesantren]]'' (Islamic boarding schools). Religion and pencak silat became intertwined. [[Silat]] evolved from folk dancing, becoming part of the region's defense against invaders.

Banten is known for its warriors, who are proficient in the martial arts.<ref name=":1" /> ''Debus'' (from {{langx|ar|دَبُّوس|dabbūs}}) is a Bantenese martial art which was developed during the 16th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indonesia.travel/tw/en/destinations/java/serang/debus|title=Debus|website=www.indonesia.travel|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref>

Banten's 2006 population totaled 9,351,470, with 36.04 percent children, 2.57 percent elderly, and the remainder 15 to 64 years old. The province's 2005 Gross Regional Domestic Product (GDP) was primarily from the manufacturing industry sector (49.75 percent), followed by the trade, hotel and restaurant sector (17.13 percent), transportation and communication (8.58 percent), and agriculture (8.53 percent). Industry had 23.11 percent of jobs, followed by agriculture (21.14 percent), trade (20.84 percent) and transportation and communication  (9.5 percent). The northern part of the province is more economically developed than the southern part.

It is strategically located between [[Java]] and [[Sumatra]]. Most investment is in [[Tangerang]], [[South Tangerang]] and the rest of the north because of their infrastructure and proximity to [[Jakarta]]. Infrastructure in southern Banten lags behind that of the north, and Banten's development policies have prioritised growth over equality in [[Pandeglang Regency|Pandeglang]] and [[Lebak Regency|Lebak]] regencies; investors choose areas with existing infrastructure to ensure competitiveness.
