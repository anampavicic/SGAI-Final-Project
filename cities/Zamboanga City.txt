Although geographically separated, and an independent and chartered city, Zamboanga City is grouped with the province of [[Zamboanga del Sur]] by the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]] for statistical purposes, yet governed independently from it. And also, it is the largest city of that province and in the entire [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] Region.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Zamboanga City, Zamboanga del Sur |url=https://psa.gov.ph/content/zamboanga-city-zamboanga-del-sur |access-date=June 6, 2022 |website=Philippine Statistics Authority}}</ref>

In 2028, the city's population is projected to hit the 1,200,000 population mark, which will make the city fall under the [[National Economic and Development Authority|NEDA]]'s classification of a [[Metropolitan City]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://nro9.neda.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ZamPen-RDP-2023-2028-Pre-Publication-version.pdf | title=Zamboanga Peninsula Regional Development Plan 2023-2028 | work=[[Regional Development Council and National Economic and Development Authority]] | access-date=May 24, 2023}}</ref>

==History==
===Rajahnate of Sanmalan===
{{Main|Sanmalan}}

The Zamboanga Peninsula was settled in the late 12th or early 13th century by the [[Subanen people]]; along with the Subanen, it was also the homelands of the ancestors of the [[Yakan people|Yakan]], the [[Balanguingui]], and other closely related [[Sama-Bajau peoples]].<ref name="lsp24">{{Cite book |last=Pallasen |first=A.

The 11th-century Chinese [[Song dynasty]] records also mention a polity named "[[Sanmalan]]" (三麻蘭) from Mindanao, which has a name similar to Zamboanga and has been tentatively identified with it by some authors (Wang, 2008; Huang, 1980). Sanmalan is said to be led by a Rajah "Chülan". His ambassador "Ali Bakti" and that of [[Rajahnate of Butuan|Butuan's]] "Likan-hsieh" is recorded to have visited the Chinese imperial court with gifts and trade goods in AD 1011. However, the correlation between Zamboanga and Sanmalan is based only on their similar-sounding names. Sanmalan is only mentioned in conjunction with Butuan (P'u-tuan) and it is unknown if Sanmalan is indeed Zamboanga. The historian [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]] (1989) also posits the possibility that Sanmalan instead referred to a polity of the [[Sama-Bajau]] ("Samal") people.<ref name="scott">{{Cite journal |last=Scott |first=William Henry |date=1983 |title=Filipinos in China Before 1500 |url=https://archive.org/details/FilipinosInChinaBefore1500 |journal=Asian Studies |volume=21 |page=4}}</ref><ref name="wang">{{Cite journal |last=Wang |first=Zhenping |date=2008 |title=Reading Song-Ming Records on the Pre-colonial History of the Philippines |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/228735802.pdf |journal=Higashi Ajia bunka kōshō kenkyū |volume=1 |pages=249–260 |hdl-access=free |script-journal=ja:東アジア文化交渉研究 |hdl=10112/3180}}</ref>

During the 13th century, the [[Tausūg people]] began migrating to the Zamboanga Peninsula and the [[Sulu Archipelago]] from their homelands in northeastern Mindanao. They became the dominant ethnic group in the archipelago after they were [[Islam in the Philippines|Islamized]] in the 14th century and established the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] in the 15th century. A majority of the Yakan, the Balanguingui, and the Sama-Bajau were also Islamized, though most of the Subanen remained animist (with the exception of the Kolibugan subgroup in southwestern Zamboanga).<ref name="lsp24" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=Iledo |first=Josefina B. |date=n.d. |title=Zamboanga's Historic Past and the Rich Cultural Heritage |url=http://www.zamboanga.net/Arts&CultureZamboangaHistory.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927215654/http://www.zamboanga.net/Arts&CultureZamboangaHistory.htm |archive-date=September 27, 2010 |access-date=April 18, 2010 |website=zamboanga.net}}</ref><ref name="kunapipi">{{Cite journal |last=Jubilado |first=Rodney C. |date=2010 |title=On Cultural Fluidity: The Sama-Bajau of the Sulu-Sulawesi Seas |url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1257&context=kunapipi |journal=Kunapipi |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=89–101}}</ref>

===American occupation===
Upon the firm establishment of [[American colonization]] and dissolution of the Republic in 1903, Zamboanga, as a municipality, was designated as the capital of the [[Moro Province]], a semi-military government consisting of five districts: Zamboanga, [[Cotabato (province)|Cotabato]], [[Davao (province)|Davao]], [[Lanao (province)|Lanao]] and [[Sulu Archipelago|Sulu]]. It established itself the center of commerce, trade, and government of Mindanao Island.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Zamboanga – Circa 1900s |url=http://www.zamboanga.com/history/history_of_zamboanga_circa_1900s.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210171845/http://www.zamboanga.com/history/history_of_zamboanga_circa_1900s.html |archive-date=February 10, 2010 |access-date=April 18, 2010 |website=Zamboanga.com}}</ref> During this period, Zamboanga hosted a number of American regional governors, including General [[John J.

In 1920, Zamboanga City ceased to be capital of the Moro Province<ref>{{Cite web |date=October 19, 2013 |title=Provincial Capitol: Zamboanga del Sur |url=http://harrybalais.com/2013/10/provincial-capitol-zamboanga-del-sur/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019042341if_/http://harrybalais.com/2013/10/provincial-capitol-zamboanga-del-sur/ |archive-date=October 19, 2017 |access-date=May 4, 2018 |website=Legendharry}}</ref> when the department was divided into provinces in which the city became under the large [[Zamboanga (province)|province of Zamboanga]]. This encompasses the present-day [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] with the inclusion of the whole province of [[Basilan]].

When the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth government]] was established in 1935, calls to convert the municipality of Zamboanga into a city increased. On September 23, 1936, through Assemblyman Juan Alano, [[First National Assembly of the Philippines|the National Assembly of the Philippines]] passed Commonwealth Act No. 39 making Zamboanga a chartered city consisting of "the present territorial jurisdiction of the municipality of Zamboanga, the municipality of Bolong, the municipal district of Taluksangay, the whole island of [[Basilan]] and the adjacent islands, i.e., the municipality of [[Isabela, Basilan|Isabela]], the municipal district of [[Lamitan]], and the municipal district of [[Maluso, Basilan|Maluso]]."<ref name="zamboanga.com charter" /><ref name="Commonwealth Act No. 39" /> It was later signed by President [[Manuel Quezon]] on October 12, 1936. The charter made Zamboanga City as the largest city in the world in terms of land area. During these times, Zamboanga was the leading commercial and industrial city of Mindanao.

Before World War II, [[Pettit Barracks]], a part of the U.S. Army's [[43d Infantry Regiment (PS)]], was stationed there.

===Contemporary history===
==== After World War II ====
After the war, citizens on the island of [[Basilan]] found it difficult to appear in courts, pay their taxes, or seek help from the mayor and other officials. Going from Basilan to the mainland required three or more hours of [[ferry]] travel. To fix the problem, Representative Juan Alano filed a bill in Congress to separate Basilan from Zamboanga City. The island of Basilan was proclaimed a separate city through Republic Act No. 288 on July 16, 1948.<ref>{{Citation |title=Republic Act No. 288 |url=http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/2/10838 |mode=cs1 |via=Supreme Court E-Library}}</ref>

On April 7, 1953, by virtue of Republic Act No. 840, the city was classified as first-class city according to its revenue.<ref name="Republic Act No. 840">{{Citation |title=Republic Act No. 840 |url=https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/2/25860 |mode=cs1 |via=Supreme Court E-Library}}</ref>

On April 29, 1955, a special law changed the landscape of the city government when Republic Act No. 1210<ref>{{Citation |title=Republic Act No. 1210 |url=http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/2/10744 |mode=cs1 |via=Supreme Court E-Library}}</ref> amended the City Charter that made elective the position of city mayor and the creation of an elective vice mayor and eight elective city councilors. The vice mayor is the presiding-officer of the City Council. In November 1955, [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] candidate [[Cesar Climaco]] with his running-mate, Tomas Ferrer won the first local elections. They were inducted into office on January 1, 1956, as determined by the Revised Election Code.<ref>{{Citation |title=Republic Act No. 180 |url=http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/2/10407 |mode=cs1 |via=Supreme Court E-Library}}</ref>

==== Martial law years ====
On September 21, 1972, President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] signed [[Proclamation No. 1081]] placing the Philippines under [[History of the Philippines (1965–86)|martial law]]. Zamboanga City's local government came under presidential control for the first time since 1955. Marcos extended Mayor Joaquin Enriquez's term when his tenure was about to end in 1975.

President Marcos reorganized the local government on November 14, 1975, and the city council was replaced by a ''[[Sangguniang Panlungsod]]'' with the mayor as its new presiding officer and its members included the vice mayor, the chairman of the [[Sangguniang Kabataan|Katipunan ng mga Kabataang Barangay]], the president of the [[Liga ng mga Barangay|Association of Barangay Captains]], and sectoral representatives of agriculture, business and labor.<ref>{{Citation |title=Presidential Decree No. 826, November 14, 1975 |url=http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/26/17329 |mode=cs1 |via=Supreme Court E-Library}}</ref>

When Mayor Enriquez resigned and bid for the newly created [[Interim Batasang Pambansa]] in 1978, Vice Mayor Jose Vicente Atilano II was appointed by President Marcos to replace him.

==== Climaco's return and assassination (1980–1984) ====
In 1980, [[Cesar Climaco]] staged his political comeback when he was elected again to the mayoral post under his new party, the Concerned Citizens' Aggrupation. He had gone into exile to the United States in protest against Marcos' declaration of martial law.<ref>{{Cite web |title=City Socio Economic Profile: Volume II, Part I: Situation Analysis |url=http://zamboanga.net/sepvol2chap1.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508185647/http://zamboanga.net/sepvol2chap1.htm |archive-date=May 8, 2018 |access-date=May 8, 2018 |website=zamboanga.net}}</ref>

In the [[1984 Philippine parliamentary election]], Climaco was elected a member of the [[Regular Batasang Pambansa]]. However, he declined to assume his seat until he had completed his six-year term as mayor in his consistent protest against Marcos. Climaco's protest against the dictator earned Zamboanga City the distinction of 'the beacon of democracy in Mindanao'.

==Geography==
===Geology===
{{See also|List of Islands in Zamboanga City}}

The southwest and eastern sides of Zamboanga City are bounded by irregular coastlines with generally rocky terrain and occasional stretches of sandy or gravelly beaches. The coastal profile usually descends abruptly towards the sea. Where rivers enter the sea, bays have formed, and the surrounding area has filled up with alluvial soils, producing small to large coastal plains.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Topography===
The overall topography of the city could be described as rolling to very steep. There are some flat lands, mostly narrow strips along the east coast. The urban center is mostly flat with a gentle slope to the interior, ranging from 0% to 3%. A portion, about 38,000 hectares, has slopes ranging from 18% to 30%. Another 26,000 hectares has slopes of less than 3%, while about 37% of the area (52,000 hectares) has slopes ranging from 30% to more than 50%. The highest registered elevation is 1,200 metres.<ref>{{Cite web |title=City Socio Economic Profile: Chapter IV: The Physical Environment |url=http://www.zamboanga.net/sepvol2chap4.htm#_ftn5 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724140424/http://www.zamboanga.net/sepvol2chap4.htm |archive-date=July 24, 2011 |access-date=March 8, 2011 |website=zamboanga.net}}</ref>

The territorial jurisdiction of the city includes the islands of big and small Santa Cruz, Tictabon, Sacol, Manalipa, Tumalutap, Vitali, as well as other numerous islands. The total land area of the city is recorded to be 142,067.95 hectares or 1,420.6795 square kilometers and with contested land area of 3,259.07 hectares between the boundary of Limpapa and [[Zamboanga del Norte]], consolidated of the total land area 145,327.02 hectares or 1,453.2702&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> according to the latest cadastral survey of [[Department of Environment and Natural Resources|DENR IX]] year 2015.<ref>{{Cite book |last=National Economic and Development Authority |url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gMtpjuuDC8WuDx8SQH8WrKMByhg24zGJ/view?usp=embed_facebook |title=Zamboanga Peninsula: Regional Spatial Development Framework, 2016–2045 |date=n.d. |publisher=National Economic and Development Authority |location=Pagadian City |at=DENR Cadastral Survey 2015, Map 2, p. 11 |access-date=November 6, 2021 |via=Google Drive}}</ref> This does not include the area of about 25 other islands within the territorial jurisdiction of the city – which have an aggregate area of 6,248.5 hectares as verified by the Office of the City Engineer.

The ancestors of the present inhabitants of the city are said to also have migrated to other areas in the Southwestern Mindanao. Due to migration, along with the original inhabitants of the place, the [[Subanon people]], a number of other ethnicities have a visible presence in the city such as the [[Samal people|Samal]], [[Yakan people|Yakan]], [[Tausug people|Tausug]] and [[Badjao]] peoples.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jose |first=Coleen |date=June 7, 2014 |title=The Badjao Sea People of Zamboanga |url=http://thecoraltriangle.com/stories/the-badjao-sea-people-of-zamboanga |access-date=May 4, 2018 |website=The Coral Triangle}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Jose |first=Coleen |date=April 21, 2014 |title=The Badjao of Zamboanga: Victims of War and Relocation |work=Rappler |url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/55885-badjao-zamboanga-war-relocation |access-date=May 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Mawallil |first=Amir |date=July 21, 2016 |title=Opinion: A Perspective on Tausug Bravery |work=ABS-CBN News |url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/blogs/opinions/07/20/16/opinion-a-perspective-on-tausug-bravery |access-date=May 4, 2018}}</ref><ref name="Bramhall 2016">{{Cite news |last=Bramhall |first=Donna |date=March 16, 2016 |title=Meeting the Yakan People in Zamboanga City |work=Rappler |url=https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/arts-and-culture/125827-yakan-tribe-wedding-zamboanga-sulu |access-date=May 4, 2018}}</ref>

===Languages===
The ''lingua franca'' of the city is [[Chavacano]]. Originally, the language of the area was largely the [[Subanon language]], as the majority of the population was from the [[Subanon people]] who lived in their ancestral land of Zamboanga. Due to Spanish colonialism, the natives were not able to pass their indigenous language to the next generation, who were instead forced by the colonial officers to learn Spanish instead. This led to the development of the Spanish language into what later became Chavacano. The Zamboanga variety of Chavacano has Spanish as its [[lexifier]] and with its grammar influenced by the other Austronesian languages of the Philippines, notably Subanon and others. The ancestral [[Subanon language]] is spoken by some people in the city although not many understand it due to a lack of practitioners, who have been heavily influenced under colonial rule. Revitalization attempts of the indigenous Subanon language have not yet been spearheaded by the local government. Aside from Chavacano, [[Filipino language|Filipino]], and [[Philippine English|English]] are also widely used and understood, with the latter two as [[official language]]s of the Philippines, and with [[Filipino language|Filipino]] also as the [[national language]] and the national [[Lingua Franca|lingua franca]] of the Philippines. The [[Tausug language|Bahasa Sug or Tausug language]] is the second-most spoken language in the city after [[Chavacano]] due to significant Tausug migration from the neighboring provinces of the [[Sulu Archipelago]]. The [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]], [[Maguindanao language|Maguindanaon]], [[Maranao language|Maranao]], [[Sama languages|Sama]], and [[Yakan language|Yakan]] languages can also be heard within the city, most especially among their native speakers, ethnolinguistic groups, or cultural communities, and with Cebuano as the third-most spoken language in the city after [[Tausug language|Bahasa Sug]].
