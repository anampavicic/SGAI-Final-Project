'''Çanakkale''' is a city and seaport in [[Turkey]] on the southern shore of the [[Dardanelles]] at their narrowest point. It is the seat of [[Çanakkale Province]] and [[Çanakkale District]].<ref name=il>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx İl Belediyesi], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 1 March 2023.</ref> Its population is 143,622 (2021).<ref name=tuik>{{Cite web |title=Address-based population registration system (ADNKS) results dated 31 December 2021|url=https://www.tuik.gov.tr/indir/duyuru/favori_raporlar.xlsx |access-date=1 March 2023|publisher=[[TÜİK]]|language=tr |format=XLS}}</ref>

Çanakkale is the nearest major urban centre to the ancient city of [[Troy]], which (together with the ancient region of the [[Troad]]) is also located inside [[Çanakkale Province]]. The wooden horse from the 2004 movie ''[[Troy (movie)|Troy]]'' is exhibited on the Çanakkale waterfront.

Today Çanakkale is the main base for visits to the ruins of Troy and to the First World War cemeteries at [[Gallipoli campaign|Gallipoli]]. Particularly around 18 March and 25 April ([[Anzac Day|ANZAC Day]]) when there are major celebrations of the events of the war the town is heavily visited.

[[Çanakkale Airport]] is 3&nbsp;km from the city centre. [[AnadoluJet]] and [[Borajet]] have daily flights from Istanbul and [[Ankara]]. Intercity buses run to [[Bursa]], [[Istanbul]] and [[İzmir]].

==Name==
Çanakkale was originally the site of an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] fortress called ''Ḳalʿa-i Sulṭānīye'' ({{langx|ota|قلعهٔ سلطانیه|lit=fortress of the sultan}}; {{langx|tr|Sultaniye Kalesi}}). From the late 17th century onwards it became known for its glazed [[Çanakkale ceramics]], compared by the traveler [[Richard Pococke]] to [[Delftware]],<ref name="ceramopolis.com">{{Cite web |title=Canakkale Ceramics {{!}} CERAMOPOLIS |url=http://www.ceramopolis.com/?page_id=1008 |access-date=2022-10-02 |language=en-US}}</ref> hence the later name ''Çanak Kalesi'' "Pottery Castle". This was adopted as the official name for the town in 1890, although having already been in use a century earlier.<ref name="Cook" />

The [[Byzantine Empire|Greek-Byzantine]] name for Çanakkale was ''Dardanellia'',<ref>Régis Darques, ''Salonique au XXe siècle: De la cité ottomane à la métropole grecque,'' editions CNRS 2000 p. 299.</ref> from which the [[English language|English]] name [[Dardanelles]] is derived. Many accounts by 19th-century visitors to the town refer to it as Dardanelles. {{cn|date=March 2024}}

From around 1920, the [[British people|British]] began to call Çanakkale 'Chanak' and 'Kale Sultanie' in their reporting.<ref name=Prothero76>{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Anatolia|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11766/view/1/76/}}</ref>

==History==
[[Image:Polyxena_side_0059,_the_actual_kill.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Polyxena sarcophagus]] found at the Kızöldün Tumulus, the oldest known tumulus of Hellespontine Phrygia, currently on display at the [[Troy Museum]].]]
[[File:Çanakkale, Turkey - Trojan Horse, March 2022.jpg|185px|thumb|The [[Trojan horse]] that appeared in the [[Troy (film)|2004 film ''Troy'']] now stands on the Çanakkale waterfront.]]

=== Prehistory and ancient history ===
The first inhabitants of the area lived on the [[Biga, Çanakkale|Biga]] Peninsula in the Last [[Chalcolithic]] Age c. 6,000 years ago. However, very little is known about their identity and lifestyle. According to some excavations and research, the earliest settlements in the area were established at [[Kumtepe]].{{cn|date=March 2024}} [[Kumkale]] is thought to have been established in 4000 BC and [[Troy]] between 3500 and 3000 BC.{{cn|date=March 2024}}

[[Aeolians|Aeolian Greeks]] settled here in the 8th century BC and quickly established trading colonies. The region came under the control of the [[Lydia]]ns in the 7th century BC and under the control of the [[Persia]]ns in the 6th century BC. Aeolis fell under the control of the [[Ancient Macedonian army]] after [[Alexander the Great]] defeated the Persians beside the [[Biga Çayı|Granicus River]] in the [[Battle of the Granicus]] on his way to [[Asia Minor|Asia]] in 334 BC. The region came under the government of the Kingdom of [[Pergamon]] in the 2nd century BC.
The western part of the Biga Peninsula where ancient Troy is situated used to be called [[Troad|Troas]] (the Troad). The settlement  of [[Alexandria Troas]] was an important free port and trade centre in [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times. In the 2nd century AD, the region was attacked by [[Goths]] from [[Thrace]]. During the 7th and 8th centuries, [[Arab]]s hoping to attack [[Constantinople]] passed through the strait several times and reached as far as [[Sestos]]{{cn|date=March 2024}}

=== Ottoman era ===
[[Image:Clocktower_at_Dusk_-_Canakkale_-_Dardanelles_-_Turkey_(5731111108).jpg|thumb|upright|Çanakkale Clock Tower (1896) in the city centre]]
At the start of the 14th century the [[Karasids]] under Demirhan Bey controlled the Anatolian side of the strait. The [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]] first gained control of [[Gallipoli]] in 1367. In 1462 [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]] had the Kale-I Sultaniye fortress built on the site now occupied by Çanakkale - it takes it names from the fact that one of the Sultan's sons had collaborated in its construction.<ref name="Cook" /> Kale-I Sultaniye was built at the narrowest point of the Dardanelles and, together with the fort of [[Kilitbahir Castle|Kilitbahir]] on the opposite side, provided effective in controlling traffic through the strait. The two forts were quickly dubbed "The Castles", and a town developed to the north-east of Kale-I Sultaniye.

From the late 15th century onwards, Jewish refugees [[Alhambra Decree|expelled from Spain]] settled in Çanakkale and formed a sizeable community which thrived by supplying local shipping with provisions and acting as consular agents for many European nations. Into the late 19th century the Jewish community adopted Spanish as their mother-tongue. Some 1,805 Jews were registered there in 1890, out of a population of 10,862, the rest being Muslims (3,551), Orthodox Greeks (2,577), Armenians (956) and assorted foreigners (2,173).<ref name="Cook" >[[John Manuel Cook|J.M.Cook]], ''The Troad:An Archaeological and Topographical Study,'' Clarendon Press Oxford 1973 p.53, and n.3.</ref>

=== Twentieth century ===
In 1915, during the [[First World War]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] attempted to secure the Dardanelles with a view to capturing Constantinople. What is known in the West as the [[Gallipoli Campaign]], or the Dardanelles Campaign, is referred to as the Battle of Çanakkale ({{langx|tr|Çanakkale Savaşı}}) in Turkey. In March 1915 the [[Royal Navy]] failed to force the Dardanelles and suffered severe losses. In a series of operations, [[HMS Triumph (1903)|''HMS Triumph'']], [[HMS Ocean (1898)|''HMS Ocean'']], [[HMS Goliath (1898)|''HMS Goliath'']], [[HMS Irresistible (1898)|''HMS Irresistible'']] and the French battleship ''[[French battleship Bouvet|Bouvet]]'' were all sunk. The French submarine ''[[French submarine Joule (Q84)|Joule]]'' and the Australian submarine ''[[HMAS AE2|AE2]]'' were also destroyed and several other important ships were crippled. Most of the damage was inflicted by mines, though a German U-boat and Turkish small craft also contributed.

In 1920 the city was estimated to have a population of approximately 22,000. A busy [[port city|port]], it was a stopping point for vessels traveling through the strait, as it had been in the ancient past although the British who passed through described it as lacking good quality accommodation or resources. Goods exported from the port included [[wine]], hides, [[pottery]], [[ceramic tile]]s and grain.<ref name="Prothero76" />

== Attractions ==

=== In Çanakkale ===
[[File:Çanakkale Limanı.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Çanakkale Port]]
In Çanakkale town the old Kale-i Sultaniye is now called ''Çimenlik Kalesi'' and is open to the public as a military museum and art gallery. It also contains a replica of the mine-layer ''Nusret''<ref>{{Cite web |last=says |first=Huseyin |date=2013-03-17 |title=Lest We Forget: The Minelayer Nusret. |url=https://turkishnavy.net/2013/03/18/lest-we-forget-the-minelayer-nusret/ |access-date=2022-10-02 |language=en}}</ref> who used to relay mines removed from the Dardanelles by the Allied forces during the First World War.<ref name="ÇANAKKALE">{{Cite web |title=ÇANAKKALE |url=http://www.turkeyfromtheinside.com/places-to-go/c/273-canakkale.html |access-date=2022-10-02 |website=www.turkeyfromtheinside.com}}</ref>

A late 19th-century clocktower acts as a signpost for the older part of town where narrow streets are filled with bars, cafes and hotels. Also in this older part of the town is a relatively new ''Kent Müzesi'' (City Museum) which lays out the more recent history of the town.<ref name="ÇANAKKALE"/> (The contents of the old Çanakkale Archaeology Museum have been moved to the new [[Troy Museum]].)

[[File:Waterfront_Scene_-_Canakkale_-_Dardanelles_-_Turkey_(5731090570).jpg|thumb|Çanakkale waterfront]]

The most attractive part of town in the evenings is the wide waterfront promenade where the wooden horse created for the film ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'' starring Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom can be seen. Many cafes and restaurants line up here to take advantage of the view of the Dardanelles.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

=== Around Çanakkale ===
Regular ferries pass back and forth between Çanakkale and Kilitbahir where the second castle that was built to guard the Dardanelles is open to visitors.<ref>{{Cite web |title=KİLİTBAHİR |url=http://www.turkeyfromtheinside.com/places-to-go/c/42-places-to-go/928-kltbahr.html |access-date=2022-10-02 |website=www.turkeyfromtheinside.com}}</ref>

All the tour operators in Çanakkale offer tours of the [[Gallipoli Peninsula Historical Site|Gallipoli Battlefields]] and [[Troy]], sometimes on the same day. It is easy to reach Troy by minibuses from Çanakkale, although exploring the battlefields without a private car is not so easy.<ref name="ÇANAKKALE"/>

In summer it is also easy to reach [[Gökçeada (district)|Gökçeada]] -one of two inhabited Aegean islands that belong to Turkey- by ferry from Çanakkale. In winter bad weather may prevent the ferries from sailing.<ref>{{Cite web |title=GÖKÇEADA |url=http://www.turkeyfromtheinside.com/places-to-go/c/42-places-to-go/250-goekceada.html |access-date=2022-10-02 |website=www.turkeyfromtheinside.com}}</ref>

== Çanakkale Ceramics ==
From the 17th century onwards Çanakkale appears to have had a thriving ceramics industry which seemed to have expanded as its competitors in İzmik and Kütahya went into decline. The produce of the kilns was, however, less sophisticated than that of the other two major centres, and by the late 19th century it appears to have been producing much pottery specifically aimed at the tourist market. Until recently the folksy quality of much Çanakkale ware, in particular its rather clumpy animal and plant-shaped pots, were tended to be sneered at. However, these same pieces are now very popular with collectors.<ref name="ceramopolis.com"/>

== Climate ==
Çanakkale has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa'' or [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Cs'') with hot, dry summers and cool, humid winters. Winds are strong year long, particularly in winter months.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Çanakkale İklimi |url=https://izmir.mgm.gov.tr/FILES/iklim/canakkale_iklim.pdf}}</ref>
