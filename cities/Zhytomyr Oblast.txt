'''Zhytomyr Oblast''' ({{langx|uk|Житомирська область|Zhytomyrska oblast}}), also referred to as '''Zhytomyrshchyna''' ({{langx|uk|Житомирщина}}), is an [[Administrative divisions of Ukraine|oblast]] (province) in northwestern [[Ukraine]]. The [[administrative center]] of the oblast is the city of [[Zhytomyr]]. Its population is approximately {{Ua-pop-est2022|1,179,032|.}}

==History==
[[File:Flag of Zhytomyr Oblast (2002-2003).svg|thumb|left|Flag of Zhytomyr Oblast, used for a short period between 2002-2003.<ref>{{cite web |title=Zhytomyr Oblast |url=http://www.vexillographia.ru/ukraine/zhitomir.htm |website=Vexillographia |access-date=17 September 2024}}</ref>]]
The oblast was created as part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] on September 22, 1937, out of territories of [[Vinnytsia Oblast|Vinnytsia]] and [[Kyiv Oblast|Kyiv]] oblasts as well as two [[okrugs of the Ukrainian SSR|border okrugs]] of [[Kyiv Oblast]] &ndash; Korosten Okrug and Novohrad-Volynsky Okrug.

The oblast covers territories of the historic regions of [[Polesia]], [[Volhynia]], and [[Podolia]], which are reflected on the oblast's coat of arms.

Before the 18th century the bigger half of the oblast belonged to the [[Kiev Voivodeship|Kyiv Voivodeship]] ({{Langx|pl|Kijów}}), while the smaller western half around the city of [[Zviahel]] belonged to the [[Volhynian Voivodeship (1569–1795)|Volyn Voivodeship]]. Following the [[treaty of Andrusovo]], the city of Zhytomyr ({{Langx|pl|Zytomierz}}) continued to act as an administrative center of the Kyiv Voivodeship.

Following the [[second partition of Poland]], on the newly annexed territory was formed oversized Izyaslav Vice-royalty (Russian: {{Lang|ru-Latn|namestnichestvo}}) which included former Polish territories in Volhynia, Podolia, and Kyiv land and centered in [[Izyaslav]]. However a couple of years later the [[Russian Empire]] annexed more territories of the Polish Kingdom during the [[third partition of Poland]] contributing to the complete disappearance of the Polish statehood. The Izyaslav Vice-royalty was reformed and the territory of today's Zhytomyr Oblast predominantly ended up in the Russian [[Volhynian Governorate]] and the city of [[Zviahel]] which was renamed as Novohrad-Volynskyi (Russian: {{Lang|ru-Latn|Novograd-Volynskiy}}) became its administrative center. Later the administrative center was transferred to the bigger city of Zhytomyr (Russian: {{Lang|ru-Latn|Zhitomir}}).

During the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]] Russian troops [[Russian occupation of Zhytomyr Oblast|partly occupied the region]].<ref name="7337100Zhytomyr"/> They were completely repulsed when the {{ill|Narodychi settlement hromada|be|Народыцкая пасялковая грамада|uk|Народицька селищна громада}} (where Russian forces had been dug in from the opening of the offensive in late February 2022) was declared liberated on 4 April 2022.<ref name="7337100Zhytomyr">{{in lang|uk}} [https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2022/04/4/7337100/ Zhytomyr region is liberated from Russian troops - the head of the Regional Military administration], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (4 April 2022)</ref>

{{See also |Romanization of Ukrainian}}
Most of Ukraine's oblasts are named after their [[Capital (political)|capital]] cities, officially referred to as "oblast centers" ({{langx|uk|обласний центр}}, [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]] ''oblasnyi tsentr''). The name of each oblast is a [[relative clause|relative]] [[adjective]], formed by adding a feminine [[suffix]] to the name of respective center city: ''Zhytomyr'' is the center of  the ''Zhytomyrs'ka oblast''' (Zhytomyr Oblast). Most oblasts are also sometimes referred to in a feminine noun form, following the convention of traditional regional place names, ending with the suffix "-shchyna", as is the case with Zhytomyr Oblast, ''Zhytomyrshchyna''.
