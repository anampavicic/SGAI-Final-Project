'''Santiago del Estero''' ({{IPA|es|sanˈtjaɣo ðel esˈteɾo}}, Spanish for ''Saint-James-Upon-The-Lagoon'') is the capital of [[Santiago del Estero Province]] in northern [[Argentina]]. It has a population of 252,192 inhabitants, ({{census-ar|2010}}) making it the twelfth [[List of cities in Argentina by population|largest city]] in the country, with a surface area of 2,116&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. It lies on the [[Dulce River (Argentina)|Dulce River]] and on [[National Route 9 (Argentina)|National Route 9]], at a distance of 1,042&nbsp;km north-northwest from [[Buenos Aires]]. Estimated to be 455 years old, Santiago del Estero was the first city founded by Spanish settlers in the territory that is now Argentina. As such, it is nicknamed "Madre de Ciudades" (Mother of Cities). Similarly, it has been officially declared the "mother of cities and cradle of folklore."<ref>Boletín Oficial {{cite web |url=http://www.diputados-catamarca.gov.ar/ley/BO2003/BO030103.PDF |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-04-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531175712/http://www.diputados-catamarca.gov.ar/ley/BO2003/BO030103.PDF |archive-date=2011-05-31 }}</ref>

The city houses the [[National University of Santiago del Estero]], founded in 1973, and the ''Universidad Católica'', founded in 1960. Other points of interest include the city's [[Santiago del Estero Cathedral|Cathedral]], the Santo Domingo Convent, and the Provincial Archeology Museum.

The [[Santiago del Estero Airport]] is located 6 kilometres north of the city, and has regular flights to [[Buenos Aires]] and [[San Miguel de Tucumán]].

The climate is subtropical with cool dry winters and wet humid summers. It receives an average annual precipitation of 600&nbsp;mm, and the climate is warm.

Santiago del Estero and its surroundings are home to about 100,000 speakers of [[Santiagueño Quechua|the local variety]] of [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], making it the southernmost outpost of the language of the [[Inca]]s. It is one of the few indigenous languages surviving in modern Argentina.

==History==

[[File:Complejo Juan Felipe Ibarra 5.jpg|thumbnail|Complejo Juan Felipe Ibarra]]

After a series of exploratory expeditions from [[Chile]] starting in 1543, ''Santiago del Estero del Nuevo Maestrazgo'' was founded on July 25, 1553, by [[Francisco de Aguirre (conquistador)|Francisco de Aguirre]] (although some historians consider its true foundation to be in 1550). Although it is the oldest city in Argentina, it preserves little of its former [[Spanish colonial architecture]], except for several churches.

In 1576, the governor of a province in northern Argentina commissioned the military to search for a huge mass of iron, which he had heard that Natives used for their weapons. They called the area "Heavenly Fields," translated into Spanish as [[Campo del Cielo]]. (This term now refers to a protected  area situated on the border between the provinces of [[Chaco Province|Chaco]] and Santiago del Estero, where a group of [[iron meteorite]]s were found, estimated as having fallen in a [[Holocene]] [[impact event#Holocene|impact event]] some 4,000–5,000 years ago. In 2015, Police arrested four alleged smugglers trying to steal more than a ton of protected meteorites.<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/four-arrested-argentina-smuggling-more-ton-meteorites-210404348.html Four arrested in Argentina smuggling more than ton of meteorites]</ref>)

The city was the capital of the Intendency of San Miguel de Tucumán during the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]], and first seat of its bishop; those were later moved to [[Salta]] and [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] respectively.

Santiago del Estero stands in the middle of an extensive but largely semi-arid agricultural region. Originally a [[dry forest]] area, the abundance of [[quebracho tree|quebracho]] attracted timber industries of [[British Empire|British]] capital during the 19th century, leading to extensive deforestation; the British-owned [[Central Argentine Railway]] reached the city in 1884.<ref name=scarecrow>''Historical Dictionary of Argentina''. London: Scarecrow Press, 1978.</ref>

The province, in 1948, elected a young [[Peronism|Peronist]] activist, [[Carlos Arturo Juárez]], as its Governor. Santiago del Estero's central political figure during the second half of the 20th century, he soon became indispensable to local politics (even out of power). A true ''[[Caudillo]]'' (strongman), his amiable demeanor belied a record of ruthlessness towards opposition figures.<ref name=mundo>[http://www.mundoandino.com/Argentina/Carlos-Juarez Unofficial biography of Carlos Juárez.]</ref>

The construction of the nearby Quiroga Dam (on the [[Dulce River (Argentina)|Río Dulce]]) in 1950, eased the city's chronic water shortage and spurred the growth of local agriculture, based on [[cotton]] and [[olive]]s. The city's first school of higher education, the ''Instituto Superior del Profesorado'' (a [[normal school]]), was established in 1953. The city developed a sizable manufacturing sector based on [[textile mill]]s and other [[light industry]] from the 1950s on, though the public sector remained the largest employer. Santiago del Estero's population reached 100,000 in 1970.<ref name=scarecrow/>

The province, however, remained one of the poorest in Argentina, falling further behind. In 1993, the city made international headlines when rioting erupted around the governor's mansion. What began as a protest by government workers who had not been paid in three months, soon grew to 4,000 demonstrators who burned cars, destroyed government buildings and even invaded the homes of prominent politicians.<ref>"Santiago del Estero Journal; With Fire and Fury, Argentine Poor Make a Point"  ''New York Times.'' December 22, 1993.</ref>

Juárez, by the 1990s, was readily ordering his opponents' deaths, notably that of former Governor César Iturre in 1996 and of Bishop Gerardo Sueldo in 1998. The 2002 deaths of two local women, however, were traced to Juárez's assassin, Antonio Musa Azar, and in an attempt to retain power, Juárez resigned (appointing his wife, [[w:es:Mercedes Aragonés de Juárez|Nina Juárez]], governor).<ref name=mundo/>

The bid failed, however, as President [[Néstor Kirchner]] signed an executive order removing Mrs. Juárez from her post in March 2004. The Juárez couple, in their nineties, subsequently lived under house arrest in the city of Santiago del Estero; the former strongman died in 2010.

[[File:Puente carretero santiago.jpg|thumbnail|Road bridge between Santiago del Estero and [[La Banda]]]]
The [[Vicecomodoro Ángel de la Paz Aragonés Airport]] was built in 1959 and currently has flights to and from [[Buenos Aires]] operated by [[Aerolíneas Argentinas]]. In recent years it has been refurbished and expanded given that it was operating at full capacity.<ref>[http://www.elliberal.com.ar/ampliada.php?ID=29966 Ya están habilitadas las obras realizadas en las instalaciones del aeropuerto de Mal Paso] - El Liberal, 13 February 2012.</ref>

The city's main road connection to other provinces is [[National Route 9 (Argentina)|National Route 9]], which connects it to the cities of [[Cordoba, Argentina|Cordoba]], [[Rosario]] and [[Buenos Aires]] to the south and [[San Miguel de Tucumán]], [[Salta]] and [[San Salvador de Jujuy]] to the north. National Route 64 connects the city to [[San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca]], the capital of [[Catamarca Province]]. In November 2008, a new long-distance bus terminal was inaugurated, replacing the previous bus terminal in the city.<ref>[http://www.casarosada.gob.ar/informacion/actividad-oficial/20286 Inauguran terminal de ómnibus en Santiago del Estero] - Presidencia de la Nacion, 26 November 2008.</ref>

===Railway===
The city has historically been connected through the [[General Belgrano Railway|Belgrano]] and [[General Bartolomé Mitre Railway|Mitre]] railways. An elevated commuter rail line known as [[Tren al Desarrollo]] is under construction in the city, connecting Santiago del Estero to the city of [[La Banda, Argentina|La Banda]].<ref>[http://www.sde.gov.ar/index.php?cargar=articulo&id=137 Obra pronta a ser inaugurada, el Tren al Desarrollo] - Gobierno de la Provincia de Santiago del Estero, 14 April 2015.</ref>

==Climate==
[[File:Monumento a Belgrano en Santiago del Estero.jpg|thumbnail|Monument to [[Manuel Belgrano]]]]
Santiago del Estero lies in a transition zone between more temperate climates, typical of the Pampa, and the hotter climates of the Chaco region: while daytime highs are decidedly very hot, nights tend to cool down more than most locations in the Chaco. It has a [[semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid climate]] (''BSh'') bordering on a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cwa'') under the [[Köppen climate classification]].

The city is notorious for its very hot summer weather: the average high is {{convert|34|C|F|1}} and {{convert|40|C|F|1}} are attained on a regular basis; the highest temperature on record is {{convert|46.5|C|F|1}} on November 1, 2009.<ref name = ORA>
{{cite web  |url = http://www.ora.gov.ar/eval_decadial.php 
|title = Santiago del Estero, Santiago del Estero |work = Estadísticas meteorológicas decadiales |publisher = Oficina de Riesgo Agropecuario |language = es |access-date = June 11, 2015}}</ref> Nighttime temperatures are {{convert|20|C|F|1}} in midsummer. There is a very short, humid season between December and February, with up to {{convert|140|mm|in|0}} monthly; however, this rain falls during a handful of very strong thunderstorms, and so the amount that falls on a given year is extremely variable.

Fall is still warm, with average highs of {{convert|27|C|F|1}} in April, and lows of {{convert|14|C|F|1}}. Temperatures can still soar to {{convert|40|C|F|1}} in this season. Rainfall is scarce, and becomes practically 0 for 5 months: in July, only {{convert|3.7|mm|in|0}} are expected. Winters bring very pleasant days ({{convert|20|C|F|1}}) with markedly colder nights (under {{convert|6|C|F|1}}). Nonetheless, these averages are obtained through an alternance of heat waves and cold waves: short periods of {{convert|28|to|35|C|F|1}} are followed by frosty days with highs around {{convert|12|C|F|1}}, and sometimes the thermometer fails to reach {{convert|8|C|F|1}}. The thermometer does descend below {{convert|-5|C|F|1}}, and the record low is {{convert|-9.0|C|F|1}} on July 18, 1975.<ref name=ORA />

Late in the winter, heat waves become much more common, and in September, {{convert|40|C|F|1}} are already possible. The pattern of intense heat waves followed by cool, windy weather is typical of spring, which is also very dry in Santiago. The high temperatures, extreme dryness and high winds create a very dusty environment. In October, the average high is already {{convert|31|C|F|1}}, and rainfall only arrives in late November. December is as hot as January, and the abundant rains make the landscape green for a few months.
Total precipitation is low, {{convert|609|mm|in|0}}, and varies from one year to another.

Some important figures related to the history of Santiago del Estero are Colonel [[Juan Francisco Borges]], who led the local battalion of the [[Army of the North]] during the [[Argentine War of Independence]] (and an ancestor of writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]]), the 19th-century painter Felipe Taboada, as well as Francisco René and [[Mario Roberto Santucho]], founders of the ''[[Workers' Revolutionary Party (Argentina)|Partido Revolucionario de los Trabajadores]]'' (Workers' Revolutionary Party, ''PRT'') and the ''[[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo]]'' (People's Revolutionary Army, ''ERP''), the two leading [[guerrilla]] organizations during the wave of unrest in the 1970s.

The city is home to numerous important Argentine artists, such as [[Ramón Gómez Cornet|Ramon Gómez Cornet]], Carlos Sánchez Gramajo, Alfredo Gogna, Ricardo and Rafael Touriño in visual arts, and Jorge Washington Ábalos, Bernardo Canal Feijóo, Clementina Rosa Quenel, Alberto Tasso, Carlos Virgilio Zurita and [[Julio Carreras (h)]] in literature.

Santiago's musical heritage is one of the most important cultural aspects of the city, with typical folklore [[chacarera]] and [[zamba (music)|zamba]]. Some renowned artists and groups include the Manseros Santiagueños, the Ábalos Brothers (led by Adolfo and Alfredo Ábalos), Jacinto Piedra and Dúo Coplanacu.

== Sports ==
The city is home to the [[Asociación Atlética Quimsa]], 2015 champion of Argentina's [[Liga Nacional de Básquet]]. The team plays its home games at the [[Estadio Ciudad de Santiago del Estero]].

In 2021, the [[Estadio Único Madre de Ciudades]] was inaugurated in Santiago del Estero.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telam.com.ar/notas/202103/546445-alberto-fernandez-gerardo-zamora-estadio-santiago-del-estero-unico-madre-de-ciudades-futbol-river-racing.html|title=Fernández inauguró el Estadio "Madre de Ciudades", donde jugará la Selección|work=[[Télam]]|date=4 March 2021|access-date=15 January 2023|language=es}}</ref> The stadium is expected to host ten matches of the [[2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup]].
