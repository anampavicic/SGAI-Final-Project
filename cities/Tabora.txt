'''Tabora'''<ref>Many ínternet sites claim a former German name of the town as "Weidmannsheil" without giving references. This claim, however, is obviously mistaken. The German [http://www.ub.bildarchiv-dkg.uni-frankfurt.de/Bildprojekt/Lexikon/php/suche_db.php?suchname=Tabora Koloniallexikon] (encyclopedia of the German colonies) of 1913 in its entry on Tabora has no mention of "Weidmannsheil" nor do the maps in the same encyclopedia show this name at all. There may be a mixup with a hunting hut known by the name of Weidmannsheil (the name is a greeting among hunters) along the Ugalla River southeast of Tabora. Compare [https://archive.org/stream/diesugthierede00mats/diesugthierede00mats_djvu.txt Paul Matschie, Die Säugetiere Deutsch-Ostafrikas, 1895, p. 96 (scanned online text)]</ref> is the capital of [[Tanzania]]'s [[Tabora Region]] and is classified as a municipality by the Tanzanian government. It is also the administrative seat of [[Tabora Urban District]]. According to the 2012 census, the district had a population of 226,999.<ref>[http://www.nbs.go.tz/sensa/PDF/Census%20General%20Report%20-%2029%20March%202013_Combined_Final%20for%20Printing.pdf Population Distribution by Administrative Units, United Republic of Tanzania, 2013] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502230453/http://www.nbs.go.tz/sensa/PDF/Census%20General%20Report%20-%2029%20March%202013_Combined_Final%20for%20Printing.pdf |date=2 May 2013 }}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA0716, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Tabora, Inderläden.jpg|thumb|left|Indian shops in the year 1906 during the day time.]]
In the early 1830s, coastal traders increasingly settled in the region to take advantage of the ivory and slave caravan trade. [[Swahili people|Swahili]] and [[Omani]] traders established Kazeh, near present-day Tabora, in the 1850s. By 1870, Tabora was home to a population of 5,000-10,000 people living in roughly fifty large square houses. These homes accommodated up to several hundred people each and had inner courtyards, adjacent garden plots, store rooms, servant quarters, and outbuildings for slaves. 

The town was surrounded by [[Nyamwezi people|Nyamwezi]] villages, whose people provided produce and caravan labor. In this period the Sultan of Zanzibar appointed a representative there.<ref>Deutsch, Jan-George. "Emancipation without Abolition in German East Africa: c. 1884-1914", Ohio University Press. 2006. p. 22.</ref> It was part of the Kingdom of [[Unyanyembe]]. Tabora was a center of trade for traders from as far North as the [[Buganda|Buganda Kingdom]]. By August 1871, one-quarter of the town was burned when the forces of the Nyamwezi ruler [[Mirambo]] sacked it.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=j6XymwBhAO8C&pg=PR76 ''Stanley: Africa's Greatest Explorer'', authored by Tim Jeal, Faber & Faber, 2011, p. 76]</ref> 

Although the [[German East Africa]] protectorate was proclaimed over the region in 1885, as late as 1891 travellers reported it to be a lawless town. The German colonial administration did not gain control of it until later that year. As a major station on the [[Central Line (Tanzania)|Central Line]], it became the most important administrative centre of central German East Africa.

In 1916 the colonial garrison had an emergency mint at Tabora, making some gold pieces as well as large numbers of crude copper and brass [[German East African rupie]] minor coins,  [[Mint mark]]ed with a "T".<ref>[http://www.tokencoins.com/gea01.htm German East African "gun metal coin"]</ref> 

During the [[Tabora Offensive]] in the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African Campaign]] of [[World War I]], colonial armed forces of the Belgian Congo (''Force Publique'') under the command of General [[Charles Tombeur]] captured the town on 19 September 1916 after 10 days and nights of heavy fighting.<ref>{{cite book| author=David van Reybrouck| author-link=David van Reybrouck|title=[[Congo: The Epic History of a People]]|publisher=De Bezige Bij|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9789023472797}}</ref>

== Socio-economic situation ==

Tabora and its people mainly rely on agricultural activities as either sustenance farmers or small-scale [[tobacco]] farmers. Tabora also hosts a [[Track ballast|ballast]] quarry.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Water supply is managed by the Tabora Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Authority (Tuwasa), sourced from Igombe and Kazima Dams.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tabora Urban Water Supply And Sanitation Authority |url=http://www.tuwasa.go.tz/ |website=www.tuwasa.go.tz}}</ref> The Igombe River is a tributary of the [[Malagarasi River]] and the [[Malagarasi-Muyovozi Wetlands]].

== Food and culture ==
[[File:Farmers harvesting rice.jpg|thumb|left|Rice harvest in Igunga, Tabora, Tanzania]]

Tabora's streets are lined with century-old mango trees planted by Omani traders. Tabora is known as the fruit capital of Western Tanzania, and markets are often filled with local produce.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Tabora has many small local restaurants offering typical Tanzanian restaurant food like Ugali (a thick maize porridge), chips, or rice with beans, beef or chicken. For breakfast or lunch, there is usually chipsi-mayai (chips and egg), which is basically a couple of eggs fried together with some chips. Although the food is bland, it is usually served with Tanzanian chili sauce, which gives the meal some character.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

A local specialty is pumpkin in peanut butter sauce. This goes with the rice pilau served widely throughout the region.

For snacks there are local sambusa (samosa), some goat meat on a stick or some freshly roasted corn of the cob, all widely available in Tabora. There is a choice of fruit in the large regional market of Tabora, including pineapples, watermelons, and bananas.

== Climate ==
Tabora has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Aw'') with two seasons of approximately equal length. The [[wet season]] is from November to April and is followed by a [[dry season]] from May to October.
