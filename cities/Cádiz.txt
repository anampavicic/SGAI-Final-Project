It is located in the southwest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] off the [[Atlantic Ocean]] separated from neighbouring [[San Fernando, C√°diz|San Fernando]] by a narrow isthmus.

C√°diz, one of the [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|oldest continuously inhabited cities]] in [[Western Europe]], was founded by the [[Phoenicia]]ns as a trading post.<ref name="ReferenceA">[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica]]'' 3.5.5</ref><ref name="Gitin2002">{{cite book |last1=Gitin |first1=Seymour |title=The Phoenicians in Spain: An Archaeological Review of the Eighth-Sixth Centuries B.C.E. {{!}} A Collection of Articles Translated from Spanish |year=2002 |publisher=Penn State Press |isbn=978-1-57506-529-8 |pages=156‚Äì157 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-YfEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA156}}</ref> In the 18th century, the Port in the Bay of C√°diz consolidated as the main harbour of mainland Spain, enjoying the virtual monopoly of trade with the Americas until 1778. It is also the site of the [[University of C√°diz]].

Situated on a narrow slice of land surrounded by the sea‚Äö C√°diz is, in most respects, a typical Andalusian city with well-preserved historical landmarks. The older part of C√°diz, within the remnants of the [[defensive wall|city walls]], is commonly referred to as the Old Town ({{langx|es|Casco Antiguo|links=no}}), and represents a large area of the total size of the city. It is characterized by the antiquity of its various quarters ({{lang|es|barrios}}), among them {{lang|es|El P√≥pulo}}, {{lang|es|La Vi√±a}}, and {{lang|es|Santa Mar√≠a}}, which present a marked contrast to the newer areas of town. While the Old City's street plan consists of narrow winding alleys connecting large plazas, newer areas of C√°diz typically have wide avenues and more modern buildings. The city is dotted with parks where [[exotic plants]] flourish, including giant trees supposedly brought to the Iberian Peninsula from the [[New World]]. This includes the historic [[Parque Genov√©s]].

[[Numismatic]] inscriptions in the [[Phoenician language]] record that the [[Phoenicia]]ns knew the site as {{lang|phn-Latn|a Gadir}} or {{lang|phn-Latn|Agadir}} ({{langx|phn|{{popdf}}ê§Äê§Çê§Éê§ì|links=no}}, {{lang|phn-Latn| ægdr}}),{{sfnp|Head & al.|1911|p=3}} meaning 'wall', 'compound', or (by [[metonymy]]) 'stronghold'.<ref>"Phoenician and Punic Inscriptions", [https://books.google.com/books?id=kwABAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA141 p. 141]. ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland''. Accessed 24 July 2013.</ref> Borrowed by the [[Berber languages]], this became the ''[[agadir (granary)|agadir]]'' ([[Central Morocco Tamazight|Tamazight]] for 'wall' and [[Shilha language|Shilha]] for 'fortified granary') common in [[North Africa]]n place names,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lipi≈Ñski |first=Edward |publication-date=2001 |date=2002 |title=Semitic Languages: Outline of a Comparative Grammar |volume=80 |series=Orientalia Lovaniensia Analecta |publisher=Peeters Leeuven |page=575 |isbn=978-90-429-0815-4 |url=http://www.peeters-leuven.be/boekoverz.asp?nr=6387 |access-date=28 June 2008 |archive-date=11 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011031812/http://www.peeters-leuven.be/boekoverz.asp?nr=6387 }}</ref> such as that of the Moroccan city of [[Agadir]]. The [[Carthaginians]] continued to use this name and all subsequent names have derived from it.

[[Attic Greek]] sources [[hellenized]] ''Gadir'' as {{lang|grc-Latn|t√† G√°deira}} ({{langx|grc|œÑ·Ω∞ ŒìŒ¨Œ¥ŒµŒπœÅŒ±}}), which is neuter plural. [[Herodotus]], using [[Ionic Greek]], transcribed it a little differently, as {{lang|grc-Latn|G·∏ódeira}} ({{lang|grc|ŒìŒÆŒ¥ŒµŒπœÅŒ±}}). Rarely, as in [[Stephanus of Byzantium]]'s notes on the writings of [[Eratosthenes]], is the name given in the feminine singular form as {{lang|grc-Latn|h√® Gade√≠ra}} ({{lang|grc|·º° ŒìŒ±Œ¥ŒµŒØœÅŒ±}}).

In [[Latin]], the city was known as {{lang|la|GƒÅdƒìs}} and its Roman colony as {{lang|la|Augusta Urbs Iulia Gaditana}} ('The August City of [[Julia (gens)|Julia]] of C√°diz'). In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the Latin name became {{lang|ar-Latn|QƒÅdis}} ({{langx|ar|ŸÇÿßÿØÿ≥|links=no}}), from which the Spanish {{lang|es|C√°diz}} derives. The Spanish [[demonym]] for people and things from C√°diz is {{lang|es|gaditano}}.

The same root also gives the modern Italian ''C√†dice'', Catalan ''Cadis'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Nomencl√†tor mundial - Oficina d'Onom√†stica - Secci√≥ Filol√≤gica - Institut d'Estudis Catalans|url=https://nomenclator-mundial.iec.cat/info.asp?id=1043|access-date=5 August 2024}}</ref> Portuguese ''C√°dis'',<ref>''[http://portaldalinguaportuguesa.org/index.php?action=toponyms&action=toponyms&act=list&letter=c Dicion√°rio de Gent√≠licos e Top√≥nimos.]'' Portal da L√≠ngua Portuguesa. portaldalinguaportuguesa.org. 26 November 2022.</ref> and French ''Cadix'', the last also appearing in many English sources before the 20th century.<ref name="Osbeck">{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Osbeck |author-link=Pehr Osbeck |title= A Voyage to China and the East Indies |translator-first=Johann Reinhold |translator-last=Forster |volume=1 |page=13 |location=London |publisher=Benjamin White |date=1771 |quote=Cadiz, or ''Cadix'', or, as the Engli≈øh ≈øometimes call it, ''Cales'' is the principal ≈øea-port in Spain}}</ref>

The name ''Cales'', which usually refers to [[Calais]] in France, is also used for C√°diz,<ref name="Osbeck"/> especially in the context of the 1596 [[Capture of C√°diz]] by the British and Dutch, as [[Thomas Percy (bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]] notes in his introduction of the ballad "The Winning of Cales"<ref>[https://www.exclassics.com/percy/perc93.htm "The Winning of Cales."] at the Ex-Classics project website. "The subject of this ballad is the taking of the city of Cadiz (called by our sailors corruptly Cales)..."</ref> (and it is also found in the sarcastic rhyme beginning "A gentleman of Wales, a knight of Cales").

In English, the name ''C√°diz'', traditionally spelt without the [[acute accent]] mark on the ''a'', is pronounced variously. When the accent is on the second syllable, it is usually pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|…ô|Àà|d|…™|z}} but, when the accent is on the first syllable, it may be pronounced as {{IPAc-en|audio=Cadiz pronunciation.ogg|Àà|k|e…™|d|…™|z}}, {{IPAc-en|Àà|k|…ë:|d|…™|z}}, {{IPAc-en|Àà|k|√¶|d|…™|z}}, and similar, typically in American English.<ref name="Collins3"/><ref name="MerWeb"/><ref name="AHD"/> In Spanish, the accent is always, as according to the spelling, on the first syllable but, while the usual pronunciation in Spain is {{IPA|es|Ààka√∞iŒ∏|}}, the [[Andalusian Spanish|local dialect]] says {{IPA|es|Ààka√∞is|}}, {{IPA|es|Ààka√∞i|}} or even {{IPA|es|Ààka.i|}} instead.

=== Foundation and early history under the Phoenicians ===
Founded as ''Gadir'' or ''Agadir'' by [[Phoenicia]]ns from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=R.

Traditionally, C√°diz's founding is dated to {{circa}} 1100 BC,<ref>[[Velleius Paterculus]], ''Hist. Rom.'' I.2.1-3.</ref> although no archaeological strata on the site can be dated earlier than the 9th century BC. One resolution for this discrepancy has been to assume that Gadir was merely a small seasonal trading post in its earliest days.

Ancient Gadir occupied two small islands‚Äîprimarily a settlement, and Kotinoussa, hosting cemeteries and sanctuaries outside the urban area‚Äîsituated near the mouth of River Guadalete.<ref name="P√©rezL√≥pez-Ruiz2016">{{cite book |last1=P√©rez |first1=Sebasti√°n Celestino |last2=L√≥pez-Ruiz |first2=Carolina |title=Tartessos and the Phoenicians in Iberia |year=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-967274-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Va1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA140 |pages=140‚Äì141}}</ref> Presently, these islands are interconnected. While the ancient ruins of Gadir beneath modern C√°diz's historical center remain largely unexcavated, excavations have been carried out in the southern cemeteries.

By the 6th century BC, disturbances within Phoenicia itself, notably the [[Siege of Tyre (586‚Äì573 BC)|fall of Tyre]] to the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonians]] (573 BC), led to the end of Phoenician control over southern Iberia. This vacuum was later filled by [[ancient Carthage]], which rose as a predominant power in the region during subsequent eras.<ref name="P√©rezL√≥pez-Ruiz2016 147">{{cite book |last1=P√©rez |first1=Sebasti√°n Celestino |last2=L√≥pez-Ruiz |first2=Carolina |title=Tartessos and the Phoenicians in Iberia |year=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-967274-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Va1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA147 |pages=147‚Äì148}}</ref>

=== Part of the Carthaginian Empire ===
The expeditions of [[Himilco]] around Spain and France and of [[Hanno the Navigator|Hanno]] around Western Africa began there. The Phoenician settlement traded with [[Tartessos]], a city-state whose exact location remains unknown but is thought to have been somewhere near the mouth of the [[Guadalquivir River]].
{{See also|Temple of Hercules Gaditanus}}
One of the city's notable features during antiquity was the temple on the south end of its island dedicated to the Phoenician god [[Melqart]], who was conflated with [[Hercules]] by the Greeks and Romans under the names "Tyrian Hercules" and "Hercules Gaditanus". It had an oracle and was famed for its wealth.<ref name=willsmith/> In [[Greek mythology]], Hercules was sometimes credited with founding ''Gadeira'' after performing his [[labors of Hercules|tenth labor]], the slaying of [[Geryon]], a monster with three heads and torsos joined to a single pair of legs. (A [[tumulus]] near Gadeira was associated with Geryon's final resting-place.<ref>''[[Apollonius of Tyana|Life of Apollonius of Tyana]]'', v. 5.</ref>) According to the ''[[Life of Apollonius of Tyana]]'', the "Heracleum" (i.e., the temple of Melqart) was still standing during the 1st century. Some historians, based in part on this source, believe that the columns of this temple were the origin of the myth of the "[[pillars of Hercules]]".<ref>From the ''Life of [[Apollonius of Tyana]]'': " ... the pillars in the temple were made of gold and silver smelted together so as to be of one color, and they were over a cubit high, of square form, resembling anvils; and their capitals were inscribed with letters which were neither Egyptian nor Indian nor of any kind which he could decipher. But Apollonius, since the priests would tell him nothing, remarked: 'Heracles of Egypt does not permit me not to tell all I know. These pillars are ties between earth and ocean, and they were inscribed by Heracles in the house of the Fates, to prevent any discord arising between the elements, and to save their mutual affection for one another from violation.{{'"}}</ref>

[[File:Estatuillas votivas del templo de H√©rcules Gaditano.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Votive statues of Melqart-Hercules from the Islote de Sancti Petri]]

The city fell under the sway of [[Carthage]] during [[Hamilcar Barca]]'s Iberian campaign after the [[First Punic War]]. C√°diz became a depot for [[Hannibal]]'s conquest of southern [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], and he sacrificed there to Hercules/Melqart before setting off on his famous journey in 218&nbsp;BC to cross the Alps and invade Italy.<ref>Livy, 21.21.</ref> Later the city fell to [[Roman Republic|Romans]] under [[Scipio Africanus]] in 206&nbsp;BC.<ref>Livy (epitome) 33.</ref>

=== Under Rome's rule ===
Under the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire|Empire]], the city flourished as a port and naval base known as ''Gades''. [[Suetonius]] relates how Julius Caesar, when visiting Gades as a [[quaestor]] (junior senator), saw a statue of Alexander the Great there and was saddened to think that he himself, though the same age, had still achieved nothing memorable.<ref>Suetonius, Divi Iuli, ''Vita Divi Iuli'' 7.</ref>
[[File:Gadeiras314.svg|thumb|right|The Bay of C√°diz in antiquity featuring a notably different coastline.]]
The people of Gades had an alliance with Rome and [[Julius Caesar]] bestowed [[Roman citizenship]] on all its inhabitants in 49&nbsp;BC.<ref name=willsmith/> By the time of [[Augustus]]'s census, C√°diz was home to more than five hundred ''[[equites]]'' (members of the wealthy upper class), a concentration rivaled only by [[Patavium]] ([[Padua]]) and [[Rome]] itself.<ref>[[Strabo]]. ''Geography''.</ref> It was the principal city of the [[Colonies in antiquity|Roman colony]] of Augusta Urbs Julia Gaditana. An [[Aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] provided fresh water to the town, the island's supply being poor, running across open sea for its last leg. However, Roman Gades was never very large. It consisted only of the northwest corner of the present island, and most of its wealthy citizens maintained estates outside of it on the [[Castle of San Sebasti√°n (C√°diz)|nearby island]] or on the mainland.<ref name=willsmith>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Smith |first1=Philip |editor1=William Smith |editor1-link=William Smith (lexicographer)|title=Gades (-ium; also Gadis, and Gaddis) |date=1854 |publisher=Little, Brown & Co. |location=Boston |pages=923‚Äì925 |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_aAkFAAAAYAAJ/page/922/mode/2up |encyclopedia =Dictionary of Greek and Roman geography |volume=1: ABACAENUM ‚Äî HYTANIS |series=(In two volumes)}}</ref> The lifestyle maintained on the estates led to the [[Puellae gaditanae|Gaditan dancing girls]] (the {{lang|la|puellae gaditanae}}) becoming famous throughout the ancient world.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fear |first1=A.

Although it is not in fact the most westerly city in the Spanish peninsula, for the Romans C√°diz had that reputation. The poet [[Juvenal]] begins his famous tenth satire with the words: ''Omnibus in terris quae sunt a Gadibus usque Auroram et Gangen'' ('In all the lands which exist from Gades as far as Dawn and the Ganges ...').<ref>Juvenal, ''Satires'', 10.1-2.</ref>

=== Switching hands in later antiquity ===
The [[Military history of Spain#The collapse of Rome and barbarian invasions|overthrow of Roman power]] in [[Hispania Baetica]] by the [[Visigoths]] in the AD 400s saw the destruction of the original city, of which few traces remain today. The site was later reconquered by Justinian in 551 as part of the Byzantine province of [[Spania]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=J. A. S.|title=New Catholic Encyclopedia|date=2003|publisher=Gale|location=Justinian I, Byzantine Emperor|pages=95‚Äì102|edition=2nd|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=GVRL&sw=w&v=2.1&id=GALE%7CCX3407706178&it=r&asid=597495c9e192f0c69fe38330c92441cd|access-date=26 January 2017}}</ref> It would remain Byzantine until [[Leovigild]]'s reconquest in 572 returned it to the Visigothic Kingdom.

=== Al-Andalus ===
Under [[Moors|Moorish]] rule between 711 and 1262, the city was called ''QƒÅdis'', whence the modern [[Spanish naming customs|Spanish]] name was derived. A famous Muslim legend developed concerning an "[[Idol of Cadiz|idol]]" (''sanam QƒÅdis'') over 100 [[cubit]]s tall on the outskirts of C√°diz whose magic blocked the [[strait of Gibraltar]] with contrary winds and currents; its destruction by [[Abd-al-Mumin]] {{circa|lk=no|1145}} supposedly permitted ships to sail through the strait once more. It also appeared (as ''Salamcadis'') in the 12th-century [[Turpin (archbishop of Rheims)|Pseudo-Turpin]]'s [[Historia Caroli Magni|history of Charlemagne]], where it was considered a statue of [[Muhammad]] and thought to warn the Muslims of Christian invasion.<ref>Archbishop Turpin (ascribed).

=== Post-1492 ===
During the [[Age of Exploration]], the city experienced a renaissance. [[Christopher Columbus]] sailed from C√°diz on his [[voyages of Christopher Columbus|second and fourth voyages]] and the city later became the home port of the [[Spanish treasure fleet]]. Consequently, it became a major target of Spain's enemies. The 16th century saw a series of failed raids by [[Barbary corsairs]]; the greater part of the old town was consumed in a major fire in 1569; and in April 1587 a [[Drake's 1587 expedition|raid]] by the Englishman [[Francis Drake]] occupied the harbor for three days, captured six ships, and destroyed 31 others (an event which became known in England as "the Singeing of the [[Philip II of Spain|King of Spain]]'s Beard"). The attack delayed the sailing of the [[Spanish Armada]] by a year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~ulm/history/eng_armada.htm |title=The Defeat of the English Armada and the 16th-Century Spanish Naval Resurgence |author=Wes Ulm |publisher=Harvard University personal website |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040207123748/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~ulm/history/eng_armada.htm |archive-date=7 February 2004 |access-date=30 December 2016}}</ref>

The city suffered a still more serious [[Capture of C√°diz|attack in 1596]], when it was captured by an Anglo-Dutch fleet, this time under the Earls [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|of Essex]] and [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Nottingham]]. 32 Spanish ships were destroyed and the city was captured, looted and occupied for almost a month. Finally, when the royal authorities refused to pay a ransom demanded by the English for returning the city intact, they burned much of it before leaving with their booty. A third English raid was mounted against the city in 1625 by [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]], and [[Edward Cecil, 1st Viscount Wimbledon|Edward Cecil]], but the attempt was unsuccessful. During the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1654)|Anglo-Spanish War]], [[Admiral Robert Blake]] blockaded C√°diz from 1655 to 1657. In the [[Battle of C√°diz (1702)|1702 Battle of C√°diz]], the English attacked again under [[Sir George Rooke|George Rooke]] and [[James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde]], but they were repelled after a costly siege.

In the 18th century, the [[sand bar]]s of the [[Guadalquivir]] forced the Spanish government to transfer its [[Hispanic America|America]]n trade from [[Seville]] to C√°diz, which now commanded better access to the Atlantic. Although the [[Spanish Empire|empire]] itself was declining, C√°diz now experienced another golden age because of its new importance, and many of today's historic buildings in the Old City date from this era. It became one of Spain's greatest and most cosmopolitan cities and home to trading communities from many countries, chief among which were the French and Anglo-Irish.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A description of the Irish in Seville merchants of the eighteenth century |journal=	Irish Migration Studies in Latin America |year=2007 |last1=Gamero Rojas |first1=Mercedes |last2=Fernandez Chaves |first2=Manuel Francisco |pages=106‚Äì111 |issn=1661-6065}}</ref> Irish Catholics were prohibited by the [[Penal laws (Ireland)|penal laws]] from owning land or entering a profession in Ireland, whereas in Spain they were as Catholics permitted to trade more freely than the English.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/the-irish-who-settled-in-cadiz-1.335733 |title=The Irish who settled in Cadiz |newspaper=The Irish Times |publisher=The Irish Times DAC |date=2001-11-06 |accessdate=2024-05-21 }}</ref>

On 12 October 1778, the right to trade with the Americas was expanded to most ports of mainland Spain, bringing the monopoly of trade hitherto enjoyed by the Port of the Bay of C√°diz to an end.<ref>{{Cite journal|issue=21‚Äì22|publisher=[[University of C√°diz|Editorial UCA]]|location=C√°diz|journal=Trocadero|title=C√°diz, su puerto y su bah√≠a: la aplicaci√≥n de las leyes de libre comercio|year=2010|doi=10.25267/Trocadero.2010.i21.i22.14|first=M¬™. del Mar|last=Barrientos Garc√≠a|page=238|hdl=10498/14494 |url=https://revistas.uca.es/index.php/trocadero/article/view/821/1761|hdl-access=free}}</ref>

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], C√°diz was [[Blockade of C√°diz (1797)|blockaded by the British]] from 1797 until the [[Peace of Amiens]] in 1802 and again from 1803 until the outbreak of the [[Peninsular War]] in 1808. In that war, it was one of the few Spanish cities to hold out against the invading French and their candidate [[Joseph Bonaparte]]. C√°diz then became the seat of Spain's military high command and [[Cortes of C√°diz|Cortes]] (parliament) for the duration of the war. It was here that the liberal [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] was proclaimed. The citizens revolted in 1820 to secure a renewal of this constitution and the revolution spread successfully until [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] was imprisoned in C√°diz. [[Military of France|French forces]] secured the release of Ferdinand in the 1823 [[Battle of Trocadero]] and suppressed liberalism for a time. In 1868, C√°diz was once again the seat of a revolution, resulting in the eventual abdication and exile of Queen [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]]. The Cortes of C√°diz decided to reinstate the monarchy under King [[Amadeo of Spain|Amadeo]] just two years later.

In recent years{{When |date=July 2023}}, the city has undergone much reconstruction. Many monuments, cathedrals, and [[landmark]]s have been cleaned and restored.

==Diocese==
{{Main|Roman Catholic Diocese of C√°diz y Ceuta}}
The diocese of C√°diz and [[Ceuta]] is a [[suffragan]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seville]]; that is, it is a diocese within the metropolitan see of Seville. It became a diocese in 1263 after its [[Reconquista]] (reconquest) from the Moors. By the [[Concordat]] of 1753, in which the Spanish crown also gained the rights to make appointments to church offices and to tax church lands, the Diocese of C√°diz was merged with the [[Diocese of Ceuta]], a Spanish conclave on the northern coast of Africa, and the [[diocesan bishop]] became, by virtue of his office, the [[apostolic administrator]] of Ceuta.

[[File:Cadiz Spain.jpg|thumb|View of Cadiz, with Catedral de C√°diz, from Mirador El Vendaval]]

Among the many landmarks of historical and scenic interest in C√°diz, a few stand out. The city can boast of an unusual cathedral of various [[architectural style]]s, a theater, an old municipal building, an 18th-century watchtower, a vestige of the ancient city wall, an ancient Roman theater, and electrical pylons of an eye-catchingly modern design carrying cables across the Bay of C√°diz. The old town is characterized by narrow streets connecting squares (''plazas''), bordered by the sea and by the city walls. Most of the landmark buildings are situated in the plazas.

===Plazas and their landmark buildings===
The old town of C√°diz is one of the most densely populated urban areas in Europe,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.directferries.co.uk/arrecife_cadiz_ferry.htm|title=Arrecife to Cadiz ferry tickets, compare times and prices|website=www.directferries.co.uk}}</ref> and is packed with narrow streets. The old town benefits, though, from several striking plazas, which are enjoyed by citizens and tourists alike. These are the ''Plaza de Mina'', ''Plaza San Antonio'', ''Plaza de Candelaria'', ''Plaza de San Juan de Dios'', and ''Plaza de Espa√±a''.

====Plaza de Mina====
Located in the heart of the old town, Plaza de Mina was developed in the first half of the 19th century. Previously, the land occupied by the plaza was the orchard of the convent of San Francisco. The plaza was converted into a plaza in 1838 by the architect Torcuato Benjumeda and (later) Juan Daura, with its trees being planted in 1861. It was then redeveloped again in 1897, and has remained virtually unchanged since that time. It is named after General [[Francisco Espoz y Mina]], a hero of the war of independence. [[Manuel de Falla]] y Matheu was born in Number 3 Plaza de Mina, where a plaque bears his name. The plaza also contains several statues, one of these is a bust of [[Jos√© Macpherson]] (a pioneer in the development of [[petrography]], [[stratigraphy]] and [[tectonics]]) who was born in number 12 Plaza de Mina in 1839. The [[Museum of C√°diz]], is to be found at number 5 Plaza de Mina, and contains many objects from C√°diz's 3000-year history as well as works by artists such as [[Peter Paul Rubens]]. The houses which face the plaza, many of which can be classified as [[neo-classical architecture]] or built in the style of [[Isabelline Gothic]], were originally occupied by the C√°diz [[bourgeoisie]].

The Plaza de la Catedral houses both the Cathedral and the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] church of ''Santiago'', built in 1635.

====Plaza de San Francisco and San Francisco Church and Convent====
[[File:San Antonio church 263.jpg|thumb|San Francisco church]]

Located next to Plaza de Mina, this smaller square houses the San Francisco church and convent. Originally built in 1566, it was substantially renovated in the 17th century,<ref name="cadiz2">{{cite web |publisher=Ayuntamiento de C√°diz |title=Monastery and Church of San Francisco |website=Cadiz.es |url=http://turismo.cadiz.es/en/rutas-y-visitas-en-cadiz/monastery-and-church-san-francisco |language=es |access-date=19 November 2015}}</ref> when its cloisters were added.<ref>{{cite web |title=Plan your stay in C√°diz |url=http://espanafascinante.com/english/things-to-do-in-cadiz-hotels-in-cadiz-restaurants-in-cadiz/ |access-date=13 August 2016 |website=Espa√±a Fascinante |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813181647/http://espanafascinante.com/english/things-to-do-in-cadiz-hotels-in-cadiz-restaurants-in-cadiz/|archive-date=13 August 2016 |date=2012}}</ref> Originally, the Plaza de Mina formed the convent's orchard.

====Plaza San Antonio====
[[File:Iglesia de San Antonio de Padua, C√°diz.jpg|thumb|left|Plaza de San Antonio and church]]

In the 19th century Plaza San Antonio was considered to be C√°diz's main square. The square is surrounded by a number of mansions built in [[neo-classical architecture]] or [[Isabelline Gothic]] style, once occupied by the C√°diz upper classes. San Antonio church, originally built in 1669, is also situated in the plaza.

The plaza was built in the 18th century, and on 19 March 1812 the Spanish [[Constitution of 1812]] was proclaimed here, leading to the plaza to be named Plaza de la Constituci√≥n, and then later Plaza San Antonio, after the hermit San Antonio.

In 1954 the city's mayor proclaimed the location a historic site. All construction is prohibited.

====Plaza de Candelaria====
The Plaza de Candelaria is named after the Candelaria convent, situated in the square until it was demolished in 1873 under the [[First Spanish Republic]], when its grounds were redeveloped as a plaza. The plaza is notable for a statue in its centre of [[Emilio Castelar]], president of the first Spanish republic, who was born in a house facing the square. A plaque situated on another house, states that [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], an Irish-Chilean adventurer and former dictator of Chile, also lived in the square.

====Plaza de la Catedral and the Cathedral====
{{Main|C√°diz Cathedral}}
[[File:Catedral de C√°diz, Espa√±a, 2015-12-08, DD 56.JPG|thumb|left|[[C√°diz Cathedral]]]]
One of C√°diz's most famous landmarks is its cathedral. Unlike in many places, this cathedral, known locally as the "New Cathedral," the Cathedral of C√°diz is officially the Cathedral de "Santa Cruz sobre el mar" or "Santa Cruz sobre las Aguas". It was not built on the site of the original Cathedral de Santa Cruz. The original Cathedral of Santa Cruz was completed in 1263 at the behest of Alfonso X. The old cathedral burned in the Anglo-Dutch attack on the city in 1596.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Ayuntamiento de C√°diz |title=Iglesia de Santa Cruz (Catedral Vieja) |website=Cadiz.es |url=http://turismo.cadiz.es/en/rutas-y-visitas-en-cadiz/santa-cruz-church-old-cathedral |language=es |access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> The reconstruction of the old cathedral started in the early 17th century, but when the city became more prosperous following the move of the Casa de Contrataci√≥n from Seville to C√°diz in 1717,<ref>[http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/2167.pdf El Traslado de la casa de la contratacion a Cadiz 1717]</ref> it was felt that a grander cathedral was needed.<ref name="catedraldecadiz.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.catedraldecadiz.com/la-catedral/|title=La Catedral|date=2015-04-23|website=Catedral de C√°diz|language=es|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref>

Work on the New Cathedral started in 1722 and was supervised by the architect [[Vicente Acero]], who had also built the [[Granada Cathedral]]. Acero resigned from the project and was succeeded by several other architects. As a result, this largely Baroque-style cathedral was built over a period of 116 years, and, due to this drawn-out period of construction, the cathedral underwent several major changes to its original design. Though the cathedral was originally intended to be a baroque edifice with some [[rococo]] elements, it was completed in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical style]].<ref name="catedraldecadiz.com"/> Its [[chapel]]s have many paintings and relics from the old cathedral in C√°diz and as well as from monasteries throughout Spain.

It receives the name of "Santa Cruz on the Sea" although the gaditanos demominan "New Cathedral" in contrast to the Old Cathedral (of Santa Cruz) sent to construct by [[Alfonso X]] the Wise person. It is located in the Seat of the Cathedral and is visible from almost any point of the city. It as much has schedule of visits for the interior of the recint like for the Tower of the West. The same entrance to [[cathedral]] serves to accede to the Cathedral Museum, located in Plaza Fray Felix next to the Old Cathedral. ==Historia== is a religious building of great proportions that was begun to construct according to project of the architect [[Vicente Steel]] in 1722. Steel left the project in 1739 and position became of works [[Gaspar Cay√≥n]], passing in 1757 to its nephew [[Torcuato Cay√≥n]]. After its death in 1783, happens [to him [Miguel Olive]] until 1790, date in which [begins to direct to the work [Manuel Machuca]]. Finally from 1832 to its conclusion the works directs [[to them Juan Daura]]. In the 116 years that its construction took, one sees the different change of style and tastes of [[architect]]s, explains the mixture of styles, basically three: [[baroque]], [[the neoclasicismo|neocl√°sico Rococo]] and (?). The materials that were used very were varied due to the different economic crises from which it had to in front make the city during the period of construction, therefore marble can be observed genov√©s for the different altars and doors, limestone stone and [[ostionera stone]] for the outer walls. He was Fray bishop Domingo de Silos who blessed in 1838. Because of the delay of works, many parts of the temple were exposed to the rigors of the time. This and the same situation of the building next to the sea has caused a disease in the stone that causes that this one is crumbled little by little; it is for that reason that the vaults of the temple are covered by networks that avoid the rubble fall to the ground. ==Caracter√≠sticas== the cover is a conjunction of concave and convex forms, characteristic of the baroque style. The towers that rise on both sides of the cover culminate in form of astronomical observatory; it is an exceptional fact that the Cathedral of C√°diz has bell towers of such height, since the construction of such structures was prohibited by the Borbones, when constituting a easy target for the enemy. [Has plant of [Latin cross]] and three ships, being delimited the space by sets of columns. The greater altar consists of templete of neoclassic style dedicated to the Immaculate Conception. In all the perimeter of the temple chapels (that at the moment of the construction were dedicated to lodge the necessary factories for the work of the temple) dedicated to the figure of the Ecce Homo (builds of "the Sheave") or to the patronos of the city are observed; ''San Servando'' and ''San Germ√°n'', among others. One of these chapels lodges the monumental Safekeeping of silver, builds of [[Enrique de Arfe]], that contains the Sagrada Forma in the festividad of Corpus Christi. It is possible to emphasize the two marble figures of ''San Pedro'' and ''San Pablo'' who is next to the entrance of the two smaller doors of [[cathedral]]. On the fore door are footpaths statues of the ''patronos'' saints of the city of C√°diz, ''[[San Servando]]'' and ''[[San Germ√°n]]''. It has several cupolas, emphasizing two; the greater cupola composed by a drum and the own cupola are based on pechinas and in his outside it is covered with golden tiles that during the day reflect rays of the Sun. Contiguous to this one another cupola of smaller dimensions is, located on the greater altar. Another smaller cupola is located on a dedicated room to keep different relics and rest. Under the greater altar is cripta, located under the level of the sea where Manuel de Falla is buried gaditanos illustrious personages like (??) and [[Jose Maria Pem√°n]]. An interesting element of [[cathedral]] is its choir; it is located in center, before the greater altar. True works of art are the ashlar masonry of the choir and both organs that it has. The Cathedral of C√°diz has an extensive musical file of the old Musical Chapel, with works of composers like Padilla, Garci'a Fajer or Delgado. At the moment an intention exists to recover of the forgetfulness all these works that, in most of the cases, only touched the day of their opening for the offices. ==Enlaces externos== * {{mentions last Web | = | first = | enlaceautor = | coauthors = | year = 2006 | URL = http://www.spain.info/TourSpain/Arte%20y%20Cultura/Monumentos/A/DW/0/Catedral%20de%20Cadiz?Language=ES | title = Cathedral of Cadiz | format = | builds = http://www.spain.info/ | publisher = | fechaacceso = 2007-02-05 | a√±oacceso = 2007 | Spanish language =}} * {{mentions last Web | = | first = | enlaceautor = | coauthors = | year = 2006 | URL = http://www.cadiznet.com/0404060FD3C3Ar7Dpd7Ev2C2D7C7E7Di212Fi2A23 | title = Cathedrals of Cadiz | format = | builds = http://www.cadiznet.com/ | publisher = | fechaacceso = 2007-02-05 | a√±oacceso = 2007 | Spanish language =}} * -->

====Plaza de San Juan de Dios and the Old Town Hall====
[[File:Cadiz Plaza de San Juan de Dios.jpg|thumb|right|View of the Plaza de San Juan de Dios, featuring the fa√ßade of the Old Town Hall.]]

Construction of this plaza began in the 15th century on lands reclaimed from the sea. With the demolition of the City walls in 1906 the plaza increased in size and a statue of the C√°diz politician Segismundo Moret was unveiled. Overlooking the plaza, the ''[[Ayuntamiento]]'' is the [[town hall]] of C√°diz's ''Old City''. The structure, constructed on the bases and location of the previous [[Consistorial Houses]] (1699), was built in two stages. The first stage began in 1799 under the direction of architect [[Torcuato Benjumeda]] in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style. The second stage was completed in 1861 under the direction of [[Garc√≠a del Alamo]], in the [[Isabelline Gothic]] ({{langx|es|G√≥tico Isabelino}} or, simply, the ''Isabelino'') style. Here, in 1936, the flag of [[Andalusia]] was hoisted for the first time.

====Plaza de Espa√±a and the monument to the constitution of 1812====
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
[[File:Monumento a la Constituci√≥n de 1812, C√°diz, Espa√±a, 2015-12-08, DD 80.JPG|thumb|left|[[Monument to the Constitution of 1812]]]]

The Plaza de Espa√±a is a large square close to the port. It is dominated by the [[Monument to the Constitution of 1812]], which came into being as a consequence of the demolition of a portion of the old city wall. The plaza is an extension of the old [[Plazuela del Carb√≥n]].

The goal of this demolition was to create a grand new city square to mark the hundredth anniversary of the liberal constitution, which was proclaimed in this city in 1812, and provide a setting for a suitable memorial. The work is by the architect, [[Modesto Lopez Otero]], and of the sculptor, [[Aniceto Marinas]]. The work began in 1912 and finished in 1929.

====Plaza Fragela and the Gran Teatro Falla (Falla Grand Theater)====
The original ''[[Gran Teatro Falla|Gran Teatro]]'' was constructed in 1871 by the architect Garc√≠a del Alamo, and was destroyed by a fire in August 1881. The current theater was built between 1884 and 1905 over the remains of the previous Gran Teatro. The architect was Adolfo Morales de los Rios, and the overseer of construction was Juan Cabrera de la Torre. The outside was covered in red [[brick]]s and is of a [[Neo Mud√©jar|neo-Mud√©jar]] or [[Moorish Revival|Moorish revival]] style. Following renovations in the 1920s, the theater was renamed the ''Gran Teatro Falla'', in honor of composer [[Manuel de Falla]], who is buried in the crypt of the cathedral. After a period of disrepair in the 1980s, the theater has since undergone extensive renovation.

===Other sights===

====Tavira tower====
In the 18th century, C√°diz had more than 160 towers from which local merchants could look out to sea to watch for arriving [[Cargo ship|merchant ships]] from the New World. These towers often formed part of the merchants' houses, but this particular tower was located on a high point in the city, 45 meters above sea level, and was chosen by the Navy as their official lookout in 1787 (after eliminating several other locations previously).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cadizpedia.wikanda.es/wiki/Torre_Tavira_(C%C3%A1diz)|title=Torre Tavira (C√°diz) - Cadizpedia|website=cadizpedia.wikanda.es|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> The ''Torre Tavira'', was named for its original watchman, Don Antonio Tavira, a lieutenant in the Spanish Navy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.torretavira.com/en/tavira-towers-history/|title=Tavira Tower's History - CAMERA OBSCURA (C√°diz)|website=www.torretavira.com|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> Today it is the tallest of the towers which still dot the C√°diz skyline.

====Admiral's House====
The ''Casa del Almirante'' is a palatial house, adjacent to the Plaza San Mart√≠n in the Barrio del P√≥pulo, which was constructed in 1690 with the proceeds of the lucrative trade with the Americas. It was built by the family of the admiral of the [[Spanish treasure fleet]], the so-called [[Fleet of the Indies]], Don [[Diego de Barrios]]. The exterior is sheathed in exquisite red and white Genoan marble, prepared in the workshops of Andreoli, and mounted by the master, [[Garc√≠a Narv√°ez]]. The colonnaded portico, the grand staircase under the cupola, and the hall on the main floor are architectural features of great nobility and beauty. The shield of the Barrios family appears on the second-floor balcony.

====Old customs house====
Situated within the confines of the walls which protect the flank of the port of C√°diz are three identical adjacent buildings: the Customs House, the House of Hiring and the consulate. Of the three, the former had been erected first, built in a sober neo-classical style and of ample and balanced proportions. The works began in 1765 under the direction of Juan Caballero at a cost of 7,717,200 [[Spanish real|real]]es.

====Pylons of C√°diz====
The [[Pylons of C√°diz]] are [[electricity pylon]]s of unusual design, one on either side of the [[Bay of C√°diz]], used to support huge electric-power cables. The pylons are {{convert|158|m|sp=us}} high and designed for two [[electrical network|circuits]]. The very unconventional construction consists of a narrow [[frustum]] [[steel]] framework with one crossbar at the top of each one for the insulators.

====Roman theatre====
{{main|Roman Theatre (C√°diz)}}
The Roman theatre was discovered in 1980, in the El P√≥pulo district, after a fire had destroyed some old warehouses, revealing a layer of construction that was judged to be the foundations of some medieval buildings; the foundations of these buildings had been built, in turn, upon much more ancient stones, hand-hewn limestone of a Roman character. Systematic excavations have revealed a largely intact Roman theatre.

The theatre, constructed by order of [[Lucius Cornelius Balbus (minor)]] during the 1st century BC, is the second-largest Roman theatre in the world, surpassed only by the theatre of [[Pompeii]], south of [[Rome]]. [[Cicero]], in his ''Epistulae ad Familiares'' ('Letters to his friends'), wrote of its use by Balbus for personal propaganda.

[[La Pepa Bridge]], officially "La Pepa" and also named the second bridge to C√°diz or new access to C√°diz. It opened 24 September 2015. It crosses the [[Bay of C√°diz]] linking C√°diz with [[Puerto Real]] in mainland Spain. It is the longest bridge in Spain and the longest span cable-stayed in the country.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pardillo |url=http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=2d850618192da270505d7b04e0afd32c |title=Puente de La Pepa, 3D View in Google Earth |date=6 June 2009 |access-date=27 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105092953/http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=2d850618192da270505d7b04e0afd32c |archive-date=2011-11-05}}</ref>

The Constitution of 1812 Bridge, also known as La Pepa Bridge, is a new bridge across the Bay of C√°diz, linking C√°diz with the town of Puerto Real.

This is one of the highest bridges in Europe, with 5 kilometers in total length. It is the third access to the city, along with the San Fernando road and the Carranza bridge.{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}

By the 20th century it was necessary to remodel the entrance to the Old City to accommodate modern traffic. Today, the two side-by-side arches cut into the wall serve as one of the primary entrances to the city.

''El Arco de los Blancos'' is the gate to the Populo district, built around 1300. It was the principal gate to the medieval town. The gate is named after the family of Felipe Blanco who built a chapel (now disappeared) above the gate.

''El Arco de la Rosa'' ("Rose Arch") is a gate carved into the medieval walls next to the cathedral. It is named after captain Gaspar de la Rosa, who lived in the city during the 18th century. The gate was renovated in 1973.

The ''Baluarte de la Candelaria'' (fortress or stronghold of [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Candlemas]]) is a military fortification. Taking advantage of a natural elevation of land, it was constructed in 1672 at the initiative of the governor, [[Diego Caballero de Illescas]]. Protected by a seaward-facing wall that had previously served as a seawall, Candelaria's cannons were in a position to command the channels approaching the port of C√°diz. In more recent times, the edifice has served as a headquarters for the corps of [[military engineer]]s and as the home to the army's [[homing pigeons]], birds used to carry written messages over hostile terrain. Thoroughly renovated, it is now used as a cultural venue. There has been some discussion of using it to house a [[maritime museum]], {{citation needed|date=May 2013}} but, at present, it is designated for use as a permanent exposition space.

The ''[[Castle of San Sebasti√°n (C√°diz)|Castle of San Sebasti√°n]]'' is also a military fortification and is situated at the end of a road leading out from the Caleta beach. It was built in 1706. Today the castle remains unused, although its future uses remain much debated.

The ''[[Castle of Santa Catalina (C√°diz)|Castle of Santa Catalina]]'' is also a military fortification, and is situated at the end of the Caleta beach. It was built in 1598 following the English sacking of C√°diz two years earlier. Recently{{When |date=July 2023 |reason =Ambigous, specific period of time is needed.}} renovated, today it is used for exhibitions and concerts.

==Climate==
C√°diz has a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K√∂ppen climate classification|K√∂ppen]] ''Csa'') with very mild winters and warm to hot summers. The city has significant maritime influences due to its position on a narrow peninsula. C√°diz has the warmest winters in [[Spain]] and one of the warmest in [[Europe]], with an average temperature of {{Convert|12.9|C|F}} in the coldest month.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Capella |first=Montse |date=2017-01-13 |title=15 lugares de Espa√±a para huir del invierno |url=https://www.skyscanner.es/noticias/inspiracion/15-lugares-de-espana-para-huir-del-invierno |access-date=2024-01-23 |website=Skyscanner Espana |language=es}}</ref> The annual sunshine hours of C√°diz are above 3,000h, being one of the sunniest cities in Europe. Although summer nights are tropical in nature, daytime temperatures are comparatively subdued compared to nearby inland areas such as [[Jerez de la Frontera|Jerez]] and the very hot far inland areas in Andaluc√≠a. The average sea temperature is around {{convert|16|C|F}} during the winter and around {{convert|22|C|F}} during the summer.<ref>{{cite web |title=C√°diz Sea Temperature |url=https://www.seatemperature.org/europe/spain/cadiz.htm |publisher=seatemperature.org |access-date=30 October 2020}}</ref> Snowfall is unknown at least since 1935.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ocultismocadiz3000.blogspot.com/2013/12/nieve-en-cadiz-cuando.html|title=¬°NIEVE EN CADIZ! ¬øCUANDO?|author=Fernando Soto|access-date=2020-10-20}}</ref>

==Beaches==
C√°diz, situated on a peninsula, is home to many beaches.
[[File:Catedral of Cadiz.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.|View of the cathedral from Playa de la Santamar√≠a]]
''La Playa de [[La Caleta, Spain|la Caleta]]'' is the most popular beach of C√°diz. It has always been in Carnival songs, due to its unequalled beauty and its proximity to the ''Barrio de la Vi√±a''. It is the beach of the Old City, situated between two castles, San Sebastian and Santa Catalina. It is around {{convert|400|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|30|m|sp=us}} wide at [[Tide|low tide]]. La Caleta and the boulevard show a lot of resemblance to parts of [[Havana]], the capital city of [[Cuba]], like the [[Malec√≥n, Havana|malecon]]. Therefore, it served as the set for several of the Cuban scenes in the beginning of the [[James Bond|James Bond movie]] ''[[Die Another Day]]''.

''La Playa de la Victoria'', in the newer part of C√°diz, is the beach most visited by tourists and natives of C√°diz. It is about three km long, and it has an average width of {{convert|50|m|sp=us}} of sand. The moderate [[swell (ocean)|swell]] and the absence of rocks allow family bathing. It is separated from the city by an avenue; on the landward side of the avenue, there are many shops and restaurants.

''La Playa de Santa Mar√≠a del Mar'' or ''Playita de las Mujeres'' is a small beach in C√°diz, situated between La Playa de Victoria and La Playa de la Caleta. It features excellent views of the old district of C√°diz.

Other beaches are ''Torregorda'', ''Cortadura'' and ''El Chato''.

==Culture==
=== Language ===
The phonological and phonemic features of the Spanish language spoken in C√°diz pertain to a Western Andalusian and Urban context. It is ''[[seseo|seseante]]'', with a predorsal realization of s.{{sfn|Pay√°n Sotomayor|1988|p=14}} Coda /s/ aspiration, coda /r/ ellision, and final syllable /r/ aspiration (before n or l) are dominant.{{Sfn|Pay√°n Sotomayor|1988|pp=36; 45; 47}} /x/ is overwhelmingly realised as [h].{{sfn|Pay√°n Sotomayor|1988|p=40}} While not dominant, l ‚Üí r [[Rhotacism#Spanish|rhotacism]] is common.{{sfn|Pay√°n Sotomayor|1988|p=42}} Widespread ellision of intervocalic /d/ is another feature of the local dialect.{{Sfn|Pay√°n Sotomayor|1988|pp=51‚àí60}}

===Carnival===
{{Main|Carnival of C√°diz}}
[[File:CarnavalCadiz1926.jpg|thumb|upright=0.62|Poster advertising the 1926 Carnival of C√°diz]]

The Carnival of C√°diz is one of the best known [[carnival]]s in the world. Throughout the year, carnival-related activities are almost constant in the city; there are always rehearsals, public demonstrations, and [[Competition|contest]]s of various kinds.

The Carnival of C√°diz is famous for the satirical groups called ''[[chirigota]]s'', who perform comical [[Musical composition|musical pieces]]. Typically, a chirigota is composed of seven to twelve performers{{Sfn|Fern√°ndez Jim√©nez|2015|p=67}} who sing, act and improvise accompanied by [[guitar]]s, [[kazoo]]s, a [[bass drum]], and a variety of noise-makers. Other than the chirigotas, there are many other groups of performers: choruses; ensembles called ''comparsas'', who sing in [[close harmony]] much like the [[barbershop quartets]] of [[African-American culture]] or the [[mariachi]]s of Mexico; ''cuartetos'', consisting of four (or sometimes three) performers alternating dramatic parodies and humorous songs; and ''romanceros'', [[Storytelling|storytellers]] who recite tales in verse. These diverse spectacles turn the city into a colourful and popular open-air theatre for two entire weeks in February.

The ''{{lang|es|Concurso Oficial de Agrupaciones Carnavalescas}}'' (the official association of carnival groups) sponsors a contest in the ''Gran Teatro Falla'' (see above) each year where chirigotas and other performers compete for prizes. This is the climactic event of the C√°diz carnival.

==Demographics==
According to a 2021 [[census]] estimate, the population of the city of C√°diz was 114,244 (the third-most-populated city of the province after [[Jerez de la Frontera]], with 212,830 inhabitants, and [[Algeciras]] with 122,982). It is the only capital city in Spain that is not the most or second-most populated City on its province. C√°diz is the fifty-seventh-largest Spanish city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.enterat.com/actualidad/ciudades-habitantes-espana-poblacion.php|title=Ciudades con m√°s habitantes Espa√±a 2022 (ranking poblaci√≥n)|website=ENTERAT.COM}}</ref> In recent years, the city's population has steadily declined; it is the only municipality of the [[Bay of C√°diz (comarca)|Bay of C√°diz]] (the ''[[Comarcas of Andalusia|comarca]]'' composed of C√°diz, [[Chiclana de la Frontera|Chiclana]], [[El Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a]], [[Puerto Real]], and [[San Fernando, C√°diz|San Fernando]]), whose population has diminished. There are forecasts that C√°diz may become the fourth or fifth city in the province after losing more than 10,000 inhabitants from 2011 to 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lavozdigital.es/cadiz/lvdi-cadiz-perdido-mas-10000-habitantes-ultima-decada-202112231414_noticia.html|title=C√°diz ha perdido m√°s de 10.000 habitantes en la √∫ltima d√©cada|date=23 December 2021|website=lavozdigital}}</ref> Between 1995 and 2006, it lost more than 14,000 residents, a decrease of 9%.

Among the causes of this loss of population is the peculiar geography of C√°diz; the city lies on a narrow spit of land hemmed in by the sea. Consequently, there is a pronounced shortage of land to be developed. {{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The city has very little vacant land, and a high proportion of its housing stock is relatively low in density. {{citation needed|date=June 2013}} (That is to say, many buildings are only two or three stories tall, and they are only able to house a relatively small number of people within their "footprint".) The older quarters of C√°diz are full of buildings that, because of their age and historical significance, are not eligible for [[urban renewal]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

{{Historical populations

|source=[http://www.ine.es INE (Spain)]
|graph-pos=bottom
}}

Two other physical factors tend to limit the city's population. It is impossible to increase the amount of land available for building by reclaiming land from the sea; a new national law governing coastal development thwarts this possibility. Also, because C√°diz is built on a [[Spit (landform)|sandspit]], it is a costly proposition to sink foundations deep enough to support the [[high-rise]] buildings that would allow for a higher population density. As it stands, the city's [[skyline]] is not substantially different from in the [[Middle Ages]]. A 17th-century watchtower, the Tavira Tower, still commands a panoramic view of the city and the bay despite its relatively modest {{convert|45|m|sp=us}} height. (See below.)

C√°diz is the provincial capital with the highest [[Unemployment|rate of unemployment]] in Spain. This, too, tends to depress the population level. Young Gaditanos, those between 18 and 30 years of age, have been migrating to other places in Spain ([[Madrid]] and [[Castell√≥n (province)|Castell√≥n]], chiefly), as well as to other places in Europe and the Americas. The population younger than twenty years old is only 20.58% of the total, and the population older than sixty-five is 21.67%, making C√°diz one of the most aged cities in all of Spain.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Population density===
The population distribution of the municipality is extremely uneven. In its inhabited areas, C√°diz is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. The uninhabited Zona Franca industrial area, Bay of C√°diz Port Area, and Bay of C√°diz Natural Park occupy 63.63% of the municipal area. The entire city population lives in the remaining {{convert|4.4|sqkm|sp=us}}, at an average density close to 30,000 inhabitants per square kilometer. The city is divided for statistical purposes into 10 divisions, the most densely populated one having 39,592 inhabitants per square kilometer, the least having 20,835.

The table below lists the area, population, and population density of the ten statistical divisions of C√°diz. Divisions 1 to 7, the "''stats divisions''", belong to the old town; 8, 9 and 10 correspond to the "new city".

C√°diz is connected to European route [[European route E05|E5]] which connects it with Sevilla, Cordoba and Madrid to the North and [[Algeciras]] to the South East, continuing as [[European route E15|E15]] northbound along the Spanish Mediterranean coast.

The city is served by [[Jerez Airport]], which is approximately 40&nbsp;km (25&nbsp;mi) north of the city centre. The airport offers regular domestic flights to Madrid and Barcelona as well as scheduled and seasonal charter flights to the UK, Germany and other European destinations.
