The city had historically been a trading center since the pre-colonial era, in both [[Black pepper|pepper]] and gold. The Dutch made contact with the city in the mid 17th century, eventually constructing a fortress and taking over control of the city from the [[Pagaruyung Kingdom]].

Padang has been a trade centre since the 16th century, having been controlled by the [[Pagaruyung Kingdom]] and the [[Aceh Sultanate]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kathirithamby-Wells|first1=J.|title=Achehnese Control over West Sumatra up to the Treaty of Painan, 1663|journal=Journal of Southeast Asian History|date=December 1969|volume=10|issue=3|pages=453–479|doi=10.1017/S0217781100005020|jstor=27651721}}</ref> During the 16th and 17th centuries, pepper was cultivated and traded with India, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. In 1663, the city came under the authority of the Dutch and a trading post was built in 1680. The city came under the British Empire twice, firstly from 1781 to 1784 during the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]] and again from 1795 to 1819 during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In 1819 the city was transferred back to the Netherlands. Up to circa 1780 the most important trade product was gold originating from gold mines in the region. When the mines were exhausted, the focus turned to other products such as coffee, salts, and textiles.

In 1797 Padang was inundated by a tsunami with an estimated flow depth of 5–10 metres, following an [[1797 Sumatra earthquake|earthquake]], estimated to be 8.5–8.7&nbsp;[[Moment magnitude scale|M<sub>w</sub>]], which occurred off the coast. The shaking caused considerable damage and the deaths of two people, while the tsunami resulted in several houses being washed away and several deaths at the village of Air Manis. Boats moored in the Arau river ended up on dry land, including a 200-ton sailing ship which was deposited about 1 kilometre upstream. In 1833 another tsunami inundated Padang with an estimated flow depth of 3–4 metres as a result of an [[1833 Sumatra earthquake|earthquake]], estimated to be 8.6–8.9&nbsp;[[Moment magnitude scale|M<sub>w</sub>]], which occurred off [[Bengkulu]]. The shaking caused considerable damage in Padang, and due to the tsunami boats moored in the Arau river broke their anchors and were scattered.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Natawidjaja |first= D.

The population of Padang in 1920 was 28,754, making it the second largest city in Sumatra after Palembang.<ref>A.J. Gooszen; A Demographic History of the Indonesian Archipelago, 1880–1942; KITLV Press, 1999</ref> At the time of [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|independence]] in the 1940s, the city had around 50,000 inhabitants. Coffee was still important, but copra was also a major item produced by farmers in its hinterland. Since then, the population growth has been partly a result of growth in the area of the city, but largely a result of the migration to major cities seen in so many developing nations. From 1950 the [[Ombilin]] coal field developed with Padang as its outlet port. This was seen by some observers as reflecting the economic and political colonisation of Indonesia.

Upon the entry of the Japanese army on 17 March 1942, Padang was abandoned by the Dutch due to their panic. At the same time, [[Sukarno]] was detained in the city because the Dutch at that time wanted to take him with them to escape to [[Australia]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Kesadaran Nasional: dari Kolonialisme Sampai Kemerdekaan|last=Muljana|first=Slamet|volume=2|year=2008|publisher=PT LKiS Pelangi Aksara|pages=2|isbn=978-979-1283-57-1 }}</ref> Then the commander of the Japanese Army for Sumatra met him to negotiate the fate of Indonesia.<ref>{{cite book|title=K.

==Geography==
The city of Padang is located on the west coast of the island of [[Sumatra]], with a total area of 694.96&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, equivalent to 1.65% of the area of West Sumatra.<ref name="BPS">sumbar.bps.go.id [http://sumbar.bps.go.id/?page=artikel&fd=artikel&act=lihat&idtopik=203&idartikel=102 Luas Daerah dan Jumlah Penduduk Kota Padang].</ref> More than 60% of the area of Padang is in the form of hills covered by [[protection forests]]. Only around 205.007&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of the territory is an urban area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.padang.go.id/|title=Beranda - Pemerintah Kota Padang|website=padang.go.id}}</ref> The hills stretch in the east and south of the city. The notable hills in Padang include Lampu Hill, Mount Padang, Gado-Gado Hill, and Pegambiran Hill. The city of Padang has a coastline of 68.126&nbsp;km on the mainland of Sumatra. In addition, there are also 19 small islands, including [[Sikuai Island]] with an area of 4.4&nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] in Bungus Teluk Kabung District, and [[Toran Island]] covering 25&nbsp;ha and [[Pisang Gadang Island]] in Padang Selatan District.<ref>http://www.kp3k.dkp.go.id {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125214516/http://www.kp3k.dkp.go.id/ |date=25 November 2010 }} [http://www.kp3k.dkp.go.id/lkkpn/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=72:kawasan-konservasi-perairan-nasional&limitstart=2 Kawasan Konservasi]{{Dead link|date=November 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

===Climate===
Padang features a [[tropical rainforest climate]] under [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen's climate classification]]. Since this tropical rainforest climate is more subject to the Intertropical Convergence Zone than the trade winds and cyclones are very rare, it is equatorial. Padang is one of Indonesia's wettest cities, with frequent rainfall throughout the course of the year. The city averages roughly 4300&nbsp;mm of rain per year. Padang's driest month is February, where 250&nbsp;mm of precipitation on average is observed. The city temperatures are relatively constant throughout the year, with an average of 26 degrees Celsius. Padang has 21 rivers, with the longest being [[Batang Kandis]] with a length of 20&nbsp;km. In 1980 two-thirds of the city was flooded because the city's drainage which primarily empties to [[Batang Arau]] could not contain the water.<ref>{{cite book|title=Tempo|year=1980|publisher=Badan Usaha Jaya Press Jajasan Jaya Raya|volume=10}}</ref>

It is served in small portions of various dishes, but constituting, with rice, a complete meal. Customers take – and pay for – only what they want from this array of dishes. The best known Padang dish is [[rendang]], a spicy meat stew.
