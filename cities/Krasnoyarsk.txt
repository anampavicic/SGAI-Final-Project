It is situated along the [[Yenisey|Yenisey River]], and is the second-largest city in [[Siberia]] after [[Novosibirsk]], with a population of over 1.1 million.<ref name="2021Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2021Census}}</ref> Krasnoyarsk is an important junction of the renowned [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], and is one of the largest producers of [[aluminum]] in the country. The city is known for its [[natural landscape]]; author [[Anton Chekhov]] judged Krasnoyarsk to be the most beautiful city in Siberia.<ref>Anton Chekhov, ''"The Crooked Mirror" and Other Stories'', Zebra Book, 1995. See page 200 for English translation of his journey through Siberia.</ref> The [[Krasnoyarsk Pillars|Stolby Nature Sanctuary]] is located 10&nbsp;km south of the city. Krasnoyarsk is a major educational centre in Siberia, and hosts the [[Siberian Federal University]]. In 2019, Krasnoyarsk was the host city of the [[2019 Winter Universiade]], the third hosted in Russia.

==Etymology==
The fort was named Krasny Yar ({{langx|ru|Кра́сный Яр}}) after the Yarin (a dialect of [[Khakas language|Khakas]]) name of the place where it was built, ''Kyzyl Char'' ('red steep-riverbank'),<ref>Бутанаев В. Я. "Топонимический словарь Хакасско-Минусинского края". Абакан, 1995.</ref> which was translated as Krasny (Red) Yar. 

==History==
[[File:Czech Legion monument in Kransoyarsk.jpg|thumbnail|left|Monument in the Trinity Cemetery to the [[Czechoslovak Legion|Czecho-Slovak Legion]], which controlled the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] during the [[Russian Civil War]] ]]

The city was founded on August&nbsp;19, 1628<ref name="Krasnoyarsk_charter">Charter of Krasnoyarsk</ref> as a Russian border fort when a group of [[service class people]] from [[Yeniseysk]] led by [[Andrey Dubenskiy]] arrived at the [[confluence]] of the [[Kacha River|Kacha]] and [[Yenisei River]]s and constructed fortifications intended to protect the frontier from attacks of native peoples who lived along the Yenisei and its tributaries. Along with [[Kansk]] to the east, it represented the southern limit of Russian expansion in the Yenisei basin during the seventeenth century. In a  letter to [[Michael I of Russia|Tsar Michael I]] the [[Cossack]]s reported:
:''...The town of trunks (log buildings) we have constructed and around the place of fort, we the servants of thee, our Lord, have embedded posts and fastened them with double bindings and the place of fort have strengthened mightily...''

The settlement was granted town status in 1690.<ref name="mojgorod">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mojgorod.ru/krsnjar_kraj/krasnojarsk/index.html|title=Народная энциклопедия "Мой город". Красноярск (Красноярский край)|website=www.mojgorod.ru}}</ref> An intensive growth of Krasnoyarsk began with the arrival of the [[Siberian Route]] (the road ''M53'' nowadays) in 1735 to 1741 which connected the nearby towns of [[Achinsk]] and [[Kansk]] with Krasnoyarsk and with the rest of [[Russia]].

In 1749, a meteorite with a mass of about {{cvt|700|kg}} was found {{cvt|230|km}} south of Krasnoyarsk. It was excavated by [[Peter Simon Pallas]] in 1772 and transported to Krasnoyarsk and subsequently to [[Saint Petersburg]]. The [[Krasnojarsk (meteorite)|Krasnoyarsk meteorite]] is important because it was the first [[pallasite]] ever studied and the first meteorite ever etched.

In 1822 Krasnoyarsk became the administrative center of [[Yeniseysk Governorate]].<ref name="mojgorod" /> By the end of the 19th century, Krasnoyarsk had several manufacturing facilities and railroad workshops and an [[engine house]]. Growth continued with the discovery of [[gold]] and the arrival of a [[railroad]] in 1895.

In the [[Russian Empire]], Krasnoyarsk was one of the places to which political exiles were banished. For example, eight [[Decembrist revolt|Decembrists]] were deported from St.&nbsp;Petersburg to Krasnoyarsk after the failure of the revolt.

In the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], during the [[Russian Civil War]], Siberia east of [[Omsk]] was controlled by white forces under [[Alexander Kolchak]], who in December 1919 retreated east to [[Irkutsk]] and the [[Bolsheviks]] took control of the city. On a plateau 7&nbsp;km outside of town was a prisoner of war camp with 13,000 German and Austrian troops. [[Elsa Brändström]] of the [[Swedish Red Cross]] spent almost a year there from July 1919 until May 1920.<ref>Elsa Björkman-Goldschmidt, ''Elsa Brändström'' (1969), pp. 174–187.</ref>

During the periods of centralized planning ([[Five Year Plan (USSR)|Five Year Plans]]) numerous large plants and factories were constructed in Krasnoyarsk: [[Sibtyazhmash]], the [[Krasnoyarsk Dock Yard|dock yard]], the [[Krasnoyarsk Paper Factory|paper factory]], the [[Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Power Station|hydroelectric power station]] (now the fifth largest in the world and the second in [[Russia]]), and the [[Krasnoyarsk Port|river port]].

In 1934, [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]] was formed, with Krasnoyarsk as its administrative center.

During Stalinist times, Krasnoyarsk was a major center of the [[gulag]] system. The most important labor camp was the [[Kraslag]] or ''Krasnoyarsky ITL'' (1938-{{Circa|1960}}) with the two units located in [[Kansk]] and [[Reshyoty]]. In the city of Krasnoyarsk itself, the [[Yeniseylag]] or ''Yeniseysky ITL'' labor camp was prominent as well during [[World War II]] ({{circa|1940}}–41).

During World War II, dozens of factories were evacuated from [[Ukraine]] and Western [[Russia]] to Krasnoyarsk and nearby towns, stimulating the industrial growth of the city. After the war, additional large plants were constructed: the [[Krasnoyarsk Aluminum Plant|aluminum plant]], the [[Krasnoyarsk Metallurgic Plant|metallurgic plant]], the [[Krasnoyarsk Plant of Base Metals|plant of base metals]] and many others.

In the late 1970s, the [[Soviet Union]] began constructing a [[phased array]] radar station at Abalakova, near Krasnoyarsk, which violated the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty|ABM Treaty]]. Beginning in 1983, the [[United States]] demanded its removal, until the Soviet Union admitted the radar station was a violation in 1989. Equipment was slowly removed from the site and by 1992 it was officially declared to be dismantled, though the equipment from the site was likely relocated to a new site near [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]].{{citation needed|date=January 2024}} Krasnoyarsk was also home to [[Krasnoyarsk Northeast]] air base, which was turned into living blocks after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and beginning of [[privatization]], many large plants and factories, such as the [[Krasnoyarsk Aluminum Plant]], became owned by alleged criminal authorities and [[Business oligarch|oligarchs]], while others were declared [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]]. The economic transition resulted in a dramatic rise in [[unemployment]] and numerous [[strike action|strikes]].

The best known financial scandal of the second half of the 1990s happened when ownership of the [[Krasnoyarsk Aluminum Plant]] by a known Krasnoyarsk businessman [[Anatoliy Bykov]] had been canceled after he was accused of murdering his partner, [[Vilor Struganov]]. The accusation eventually turned out to be false.<ref>Latynina, Yulia,  "Today, Let's Go Inside the Other Russia", Moscow Times, 21 February 2001</ref> The Krasnoyarsk plant's ownership problems continue through the early 21st century since nearly all of them are owned either by [[monopoly|monopolistic]] financial groups or by [[Business oligarch|oligarchs]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Since the election of [[Pyotr Pimashkov]] as the mayor of Krasnoyarsk in 1996, the appearance of the city gradually improved: the old historical buildings were restored, the asphalt walkways were replaced with paving-stone, and numerous squares and recreation areas with fountains were either restored or constructed from scratch. Now the majority of the city keeps only a few traces of its former, drab, post-collapse look.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Geography==

[[File:Krasnoyarsk1911.jpg|thumb|left|The panorama of Krasnoyarsk from the Karaulnaya Gora hill, 1910]]

The total area of the city, including suburbs and the river, is {{cvt|348|km2|sp=us}}.<ref name="Area">Poexaly.ru. Krasnoyarsk Tourist Portal. [http://www.poexaly.ru/info/forguests/krasnoyarsk/ Krasnoyarsk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201005051427/http://www.poexaly.ru/info/forguests/krasnoyarsk/ |date=October 5, 2020 }} {{in lang|ru}}</ref>

The river [[Yenisei]] flows from west to east through the city. Due to the [[Krasnoyarsk hydroelectric dam]] {{cvt|32|km|sp=us}} upstream, the Yenisei never freezes in winter and never{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} exceeds {{cvt|+14|C}} in summer through the city. Near the city center, its elevation is {{cvt|136|m|sp=us}} above [[sea level]]. There are several islands in the river, the largest of which are [[Tatyshev isle|Tatyshev]] and [[Otdyha isle|Otdyha]] Isles, used mainly for recreation.

To the south and west, Krasnoyarsk is surrounded by forested mountains averaging {{cvt|410|m|sp=us}} in height above river level. The most prominent of them are Nikolayevskaya Sopka (notable for its [[ski jumping]] tracks), Karaulnaya Gora, and Chornaya Sopka, the latter being an extinct volcano.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Атлас достопримечательностей |url=http://www.krskstate.ru/krasnoyarskkray/dostoprim/0/doc/34 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203180002/http://www.krskstate.ru/krasnoyarskkray/dostoprim/0/doc/34 |archive-date=February 3, 2013 |access-date=2013-03-26 |publisher=Krskstate.ru |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The gigantic rock cliffs of the [[Stolby Nature Sanctuary|Stolby]] Nature Reserve rise from the mountains of the southern bank of the Yenisei, the western hills from the Gremyachaya Griva crest extending westwards up to the [[Sobakina River]], the north is generally plain, except for the Drokinskaya Sopka hill, with forests to the northwest and agricultural fields to the north and east.

The major rivers in and near Krasnoyarsk are the [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]], [[Mana River|Mana]], [[Bazaikha River|Bazaikha]], and [[Kacha River]]s, the latter flowing throughout the historical center of the city. Due to the nature of the terrain, a few natural lakes exist in the vicinity of Krasnoyarsk.

The forests close to the city are mostly [[pine]] and [[birch]]; further afield, [[aspen]] becomes dominant in many areas. The moss-covered [[fir]] and [[Siberian pine]] replaces other wood in the mountains westward of the [[Karaulnaya River]], in about {{cvt|15|km|sp=us}} to the west from the city, the forests to the south are mostly [[pine]], [[fir]] and [[aspen]].<ref>Окрестности Красноярска.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Krasnoyarsk is the [[administrative center]] of the krai.<ref name="KrasnoyarskK_admlaw">Law #10-4763</ref> Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is, together with one [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|rural locality]] (the [[village#Russia|village]] of [[Peschanka, Krasnoyarsk Krai|Peschanka]]) incorporated as the ''[[city of federal subject significance|krai city]] of Krasnoyarsk''{{snd}}an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Krasnoyarsk Krai|districts]].<ref name="Ref66">Law #10-4765</ref> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the krai city of Krasnoyarsk is incorporated as ''Krasnoyarsk Urban Okrug''.<ref name="Ref759">Law #13-3148</ref>

===City divisions===
For administrative purposes, Krasnoyarsk is divided into seven city districts:
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
* [[Kirovsky City District, Krasnoyarsk|Kirovsky]]
* [[Leninsky City District, Krasnoyarsk|Leninsky]]
* [[Oktyabrsky City District, Krasnoyarsk|Oktyabrsky]]
* [[Sovetsky City District, Krasnoyarsk|Sovetsky]]
* [[Sverdlovsky City District, Krasnoyarsk|Sverdlovsky]]

{{div col end}}

==Coat of arms==
[[File:Krasnoyarsk symbol leo.jpg|right|thumb|90px|The Krasno{{shy}}yarsk Lion]]

The first version was approved on March&nbsp;12, 1804. The coat of arms was divided horizontally into two parts, the upper part containing the coat of arms of [[Tomsk Governorate]], and the lower part picturing the [[Krasny Yar cliff]] on a silver background. A revised coat of arms, approved on November&nbsp;23, 1851, had the golden figure of a lion placed on a red [[heraldry|heraldic]] shield with a spade in the right fore paw and a sickle in the left fore paw, both made of the same metal. The shield was topped with the golden crown of the [[Russian Empire]]. The current coat of arms (as depicted here) was approved on November&nbsp;28, 2004. It contains the same red shield as in 1851 but with a slightly changed figure of the lion in the officially approved image. The shield is topped with a form of the [[mural crown]], which is the golden five-tower [[Crown (heraldry)#As a display of rank|coronet of rank]] of a federal subject administrative center.<ref>[http://www.kracnoyarck.ru/gorod/simvolika/gerb-goroda-krasnoyarska Герб города Красноярска] (Krasnoyarsk City website) {{in lang|ru}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.admkrsk.ru/doc.asp?id=270|title=Красноярск, администрация города - Красноярск|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050318003641/http://www.admkrsk.ru/doc.asp?id=270|archive-date=18 March 2005}}</ref><ref>Решение Красноярского городского Совета депутатов от 26 мая 2010 года No. В-169 (Decision of the Krasnoyarsk City Council of Deputies 26 May 2010) {{in lang|ru}}</ref>

==Climate==
Krasnoyarsk experiences a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') bordering on a [[subarctic climate]] (''Dfc'') in mountain part of city. Its climate is very similar to that of [[Fort McMurray]] and [[Winnipeg]] in Canada, the latter of which is a good deal further south geographically. Compared to [[Thompson, Manitoba]], or [[Labrador City]] at similar latitudes, Krasnoyarsk's winters are relatively mild. Compared to European cities on a similar latitude, Krasnoyarsk has much warmer summers, but much colder and longer winters (for example, [[Aalborg]], [[Denmark]]). The summer is also on average warmer than similar inland latitudes of [[Scandinavia]], owing to [[Siberia]]'s greater [[continentality]]. Krasnoyarsk has high differentials between summer and winter temperatures.

The population of Krasnoyarsk includes a number of peoples, the most numerous are [[Russians]], followed by [[Tājik people|Tajiks]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] and other [[Central Asia]]n and [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] peoples, whose number has grown extensively because of the vast, often illegal [[immigration]] in search for work.
Another populous [[Immigration|immigrant group]] is the [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] who, unlike other [[foreign worker]]s, are employed in much more lucrative areas and often form business partnerships with local companies. Many Chinese trade at the [[bazaar]]s, and a special large Chinese bazaar named ''Sodruzhestvo'' (Russian for ''fellowship''), and the ''Chinese Trading Town'' (known in [[Russian Language|Russian]] as Китайский торговый город) or colloquially ''[[Kitai-gorod]]'' on [[Strelka (Krasnoyarsk)|Strelka]].

==Architecture==
[[File:Церковь Покрова Пресвятой Богородицы - внутренний двор.jpg|thumb|The [[Intercession of the Theotokos|Intercession]] church in Krasnoyarsk]]
[[File:Stalinist architecture in Krasnoyarsk.jpg|thumb|Stalinist architecture in Krasnoyarsk]]
There are a number of historical buildings in Krasnoyarsk, the oldest of them being the Intercession Cathedral ({{langx|ru|Покровский собор}}, 1785 to 1795, restored in 1977 to 1978). Other locally significant samples of [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] architecture are the Annunciation Cathedral ({{langx|ru|Благовещенский собор}}, 1802–12), the Holy Trinity Cathedral ({{langx|ru|Свято-Троицкий собор}}, 1802–12), John the Baptist Church ({{langx|ru|Церковь Иоанна Предтечи}}, 1899, former episcopal residence), and the new Michael the Archangel Church ({{langx|ru|Церковь Архистратига Михаила}}, 1998 to 2003).

On the top of the Karaulnaya Hill, originally a pagan shrine, later occupied by the Krasnoyarsk fort watchtower, the [[Paraskeva Pyatnitsa Chapel]] (1804, rebuilt 1854–55) still stands. The chapel, displayed on the 10-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] note, is one of the iconic images of the city. The chapel was abandoned and fell into disrepair during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era and only when [[Perestroyka]] came was it regained by the Yenisei [[Diocese|bishopric]].

[[File:Optima, Molokov street, Krasnoyarsk (2017-04-10).jpg|thumb|left|Shopping center "Optima"]]
Another unofficial symbol of Krasnoyarsk is the incomplete 24-story tower located at [[Strelka (Krasnoyarsk)|Strelka]]. Construction of the tower had been started just before [[Perestroyka]] and then frozen due to the administrative crisis. The outline of the tower is clearly seen from many places in the city.

A [[Krasnoyarsk Bridge|bridge near Krasnoyarsk]] carries the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] across the [[Yenisei]]. The original structure, one of the longest at the time, was constructed between 1893 and 1896 to an award-winning design by [[Lavr Proskuryakov]]. In 2003 it was rejected for emergency inscription on the [[World Heritage List]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2003 |title=Decision: 27 COM 8C.47 - The First Railway Bridge over the Yenisei River (Russian Federation) |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/741 |access-date=10 September 2021 |website=World Heritage Centre |publisher=UNESCO |language=en}}</ref> It was described at the time by [[ICOMOS]] "an early representation of a typical parabolic polygonal [[truss bridge]] in Russia" which became "a testing ground for the application of engineering theories and the development of new innovative solutions, which had numerous successors".<ref name="WHC-03/27COM/INF.8A ADD">{{Cite web |last=International Council on Monuments and Sites |date=16 June 2003 |title=Evaluations of Cultural Properties - World Heritage Committee 27th Ordinary Session |url=https://whc.unesco.org/archive/2003/whc03-27com-inf08a-adde.pdf |publisher=UNESCO |page=13}}</ref> The bridge was dismantled between 2002 and 2007.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Muzhschinsky |first=Andrey |date=21 May 2018 |title=Мосты Красноярска.

Among other notable buildings are the mansions of the merchant [[Nikolay Gadalov]] (beginning of the 20th century), the Roman Catholic Transfiguration Chapel ({{langx|ru|Преображенский собор}}, 1911, also known as the Krasnoyarsk Organ Hall), the [[Krasnoyarsk Krai Museum]] stylized as an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian temple, the [[Krasnoyarsk Cultural/Historical Center]] and the triumphal arch at the [[Strelka (Krasnoyarsk)|Spit]] (2003), the [[:File:Krasnoyarsk Mira 110 krai admin.jpg|regional administration building]] flanked with two towers known as the "Donkey Ears".

There are a number of two-story wooden houses in the city built mostly in the middle of the 20th century as temporary habitations. Many urbanized villages located inside the city keep the remnants of the traditional Russian village architecture: wooden houses with backyards, many somewhat dilapidated now but still inhabited.[[File:Strelka Krasnoyarsk.jpg|thumb|View of Strelka district from Tatyshev island]]

==Culture==

There are a number of local holidays celebrated annually in Krasnoyarsk. The most significant holiday is the Day of the City celebrated in June, usually with a [[carnival]]. Other holidays and cultural events are the Mana Festival ({{langx|ru|Манский фестиваль}}. The celebrations take place on the outside of town, on the bank of river Mana) usually held on the last weekend in June with the traditional [[Bard (Soviet Union)|bard]] contest, the [[International Museum Biennale]] traditionally held in the [[Krasnoyarsk Cultural/Historical Center]], the [[avant-garde]] ''Museum Night'' festival dedicated to the [[International Museum Day]] (May 18), the Jazz on Yenisey festival, the Stolbist Day held many times a year celebrating the traditions of [[mountain climbing]] in the [[Stolby Nature Reserve|Stolby]] national reserve, and the [[motorcycle|Bikers]]' Rally.

Krasnoyarsk has a number of local [[television]] companies and the highly developed [[telecommunications]], many districts of the city have [[Local area network|LAN]]-based broadband [[Internet]] access.

==Education and science==
Next to [[Novosibirsk]], Krasnoyarsk is a prominent scientific and educational center of [[Siberia]], with over 30 [[higher education]] facilities, many of which are the branches of the [[Russian Academy of Science]], and about 200 [[High school (upper secondary)|high schools]]. The most notable [[higher education]] institutes are:
* [[Siberian Federal University]] (Russian abbreviation is SFU), founded on November 4, 2006. The institution integrated four large higher education institutions (Krasnoyarsk State University, Krasnoyarsk State Academy of Architecture and Civil Construction, [[Krasnoyarsk State Technical University]], [[State University of Non-Ferrous Metals and Gold]])
* [[Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University]] (Russian abbreviation is KGPU), founded in 1932

* [[Krasnoyarsk State Medical University]] (Russian abbreviation is KrasGMU), founded in 1942
* [[Krasnoyarsk State Agrarian University]] (Russian abbreviation is Krasnoyarsk GAU), founded in 1952
Like [[Novosibirsk]], Krasnoyarsk has a special city district called [[Akademgorodok (Krasnoyarsk)|Akademgorodok]] ("Academic Town"), where several scientific research institutes are located. Krasnoyarsk's Institute of Biophysics is known for a 1973–1985 experiment on [[ecology|ecological]] isolation of [[human]] beings (the "[[Bios Experiment]]"). [[Sukachev Institute of Forest]], founded in 1944 at Moscow and relocated to Krasnoyarsk in 1959.

==Transportation==
[[File:Krasnoyarsk tram.jpg|left|thumb|350x350px|Tram in Krasnoyarsk]]

=== Public transportation ===
The transit system is dominated by buses, but there also are several trolleybus and [[Trams in Krasnoyarsk|tram routes]].[[File:Krs railstation.jpg|thumb|Krasnoyarsk rail station]]

[[File:Красноярск trolleybus map 2022-04.svg|thumb|Map of trolleybus routes]]

===Railway===
[[File:Речной вокзал в период реставрации.jpg|thumb|Krasnoyarsk Riverport.]]
Krasnoyarsk lies on the Yenisei River and historically has been an important junction on the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. [[Krasnoyarsk railway station|Krasnoyarsk-Passazhirsky]] ({{langx|ru|Красноярск-Пассажирский}}, lit. Krasnoyarsk-Passenger) is the main railway station of Krasnoyarsk. Long-range trains of the Trans-Siberian Railway stop at this station. There are some stations served by [[Elektrichka]] and there is [[Krasnoyarsk-East railway station|Krasnoyarsk-East]] goods station 26.3&nbsp;km east of Krasnoyarsk-Passazhirsky.

===Airports===
Krasnoyarsk was served by two airports: [[Krasnoyarsk International Airport|Yemelyanovo Airport]] is the main airport and handles both medium and long-haul domestic as well as international flights, and is {{cvt|27|km|sp=us}} northwest of the city.<ref>[http://www.yemelyanovo.ru/en/about Yemelyanovo International Airport – About/General Information]</ref> The secondary [[Krasnoyarsk Cheremshanka Airport|Cheremshanka Airport]] handled short-haul flights. Cheremshanka has lost its eminent role as the main base airport for an extensive network of local air services (MVL) in Krasnoyarsk Krai formerly served by the local Aeroflot Krasnoyarsk Directorate. In December 2011 a fire broke out at the Cheremshanka airport which destroyed the terminal building and the [[air traffic control]] tower.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.avherald.com/h?article=447e7f13&opt=0|title=Tower and terminal of Krasnojarsk Cheremshanka Airport burned down|website=The Aviation Herald}}</ref>

==Tourism==
The most popular place of attraction for tourists visiting Krasnoyarsk is the huge national nature reserve Stolby ("pillars"), which covers an area of {{cvt|470|km2|sp=us}} with numerous giant [[granite]] rocks formations up to 100 meters high, many of very extraordinary shapes. Stolby is also a major [[rock climbing]] location. Many local climbers intentionally do not use any [[belay]]ing equipment and call their [[extreme sport]] ''stolbizm'', known elsewhere as solo climbing.

Other popular showplaces include the [[Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Power Station]] dam, the [[Karaulnaya Gora]] hill with the [[Paraskeva Pyatnitsa Chapel]], museums, theaters, etc.
