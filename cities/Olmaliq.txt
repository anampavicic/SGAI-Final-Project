'''Olmaliq''' ({{langx|uz|Olmaliq / Олмалиқ}}, {{langx|ru|Алмалык|Almalyk}}) is a district-level city (2021 pop 133,400) in the [[Tashkent Region]] of central [[Uzbekistan]],<ref name=class>{{cite web|url=https://stat.uz/uploads/docs/soato(mhobt)_2020.xlsx|title=Classification system of territorial units of the Republic of Uzbekistan|language=uz, ru|date=July 2020|publisher=The State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on statistics}}</ref> approximately 65&nbsp;km east of [[Tashkent]]. It is located at latitude 40° 50' 41N; longitude  69° 35' 54E; at an altitude of 585 meters.

Olmaliq is a [[company town]] developed by the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1930s, to exploit local reserves of [[copper]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[gold]], [[silver]] and [[barite]]. The town contains several enormous [[smelting]] facilities and related industries operated today by JSC Almalyk MMC, one of the largest mining-metallurgical enterprises in Uzbekistan.

The smelter operations have extensively contaminated Almalyk, which is considered{{by whomst|date=November 2021}} one of the most polluted places on earth. The air has high concentrations of [[sulfuric acid]] fumes and the ground has hundreds of tons of [[toxic waste]].  The Uzbek government has resisted calls to close the plant, arguing that the country's economy cannot afford to do so: The plant employs around 25,000 residents of the city, and accounts for a substantial share of the region's economy.  However, in January 2005 the government announced plans to clean up the area, with a target of 2010.
