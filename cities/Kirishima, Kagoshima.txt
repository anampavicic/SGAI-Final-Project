==History==
The area of Kirishima has been inhabited since prehistoric times. The [[Uenohara site]] dates from the [[Jōmon period]], and in the [[Kofun period]] the area was a stronghold of the [[Hayato people]]. In the [[Nara period]], it became the center of ancient [[Ōsumi Province]], and the location of the [[kokufu|provincial capital]] and [[Provincial temple]].  The area largely became part of [[Shimazu Estate|Shimazu ''shōen'']] from the late [[Heian period]], and continued to be ruled by the [[Shimazu clan]] throughout the [[Edo Period]].

The modern city of Kirishima was established on November 7, 2005, from the merger of the city of [[Kokubu, Kagoshima|Kokubu]], and the towns of [[Fukuyama, Kagoshima|Fukuyama]], [[Hayato, Kagoshima|Hayato]], [[Kirishima, Kagoshima (town)|Kirishima]] (former), [[Makizono, Kagoshima|Makizono]], [[Mizobe, Kagoshima|Mizobe]] and [[Yokogawa, Kagoshima|Yokogawa]] (all from [[Aira District, Kagoshima|Aira District]]).

==Government==
Kirishima has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 25 members. Kirishima, collectively with the town of Yūsui, contributes four members to the Kagoshima Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the [[Kagoshima 4th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

== Economy ==
Kirishima has a mixed economy. Agriculture still plays a major role, with main specialty products: strawberries, tomatoes, burdock, green onions, buckwheat, leaf tobacco, mandarin oranges, tea, chestnuts, shiitake mushrooms, beef cattle, eel, etc. Local leaf tobacco production is said to have begun in 1606, shortly after tobacco was introduced to Japan. Since then, it has continued to be one of the leading production areas in Japan, but in recent years it has been steadily shrinking. Taking advantage of the geographical conditions resulting from the opening of Kagoshima Airport and the Kyushu Expressway, the city has encouraged high-tech industries such as Sony and Kyocera to build large scale production plants in the area. On the other hand, Kirishima is also a tourist destination, noted for its volcanoes, [[onsen|hot springs]] and historic sites.

[[Japan Air Commuter]] has its headquarters in Kirishima.<ref>"[http://www.jac.co.jp/company_info/index.html 会社概要]." [[Japan Air Commuter]]. Retrieved on May 19, 2009.</ref>
