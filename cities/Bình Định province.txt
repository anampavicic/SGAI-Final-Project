'''Bình Định''' is a northern coastal [[Provinces of Vietnam|province]] in the [[South Central Coast]] region, the [[Central Vietnam|Central]] of [[Vietnam]]. It borders [[Quảng Ngãi province|Quảng Ngãi]] to the north, [[Phú Yên]] to the south, [[Gia Lai]] to the west and the [[South China Sea|East Sea]] to the east.

Bình Định province has an area of {{Convert|6066.40|km2|mi2|abbr=on}},<ref name="area_2022"/> comprising 11 district-level sub-divisions, with a population of over 1.5 million people as of 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Statistical yearbook of Vietnam 2021 |url=https://www.gso.gov.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Sach-Nien-giam-TK-2021.pdf|pages=90, 93}}</ref> The province is known for its scenery and beaches. There are also a number of Cham structures. Majority of the province is covered by mountains or hills. Its capital [[Quy Nhon]] served as the capital of the historic [[Tây Sơn dynasty]]. Economically the province has the most productive primary sector in the South Central Coast region, mostly because of its large output of rice, coconuts and its strong livestock, forestry and fishing sectors.

==History==
===Champa===
{{main|Vijaya (Champa)}}
[[File:Banh It.jpg|thumb|left|Cham towers]]
Bình Định was probably one of the places where the Cham first arrived in what is now Vietnam.<ref name=V47>Vickery 2009, 47</ref> Its favourable geography led to the rise of the Cham [[Port of Thị Nại]] where Quy Nhơn is now located. The city-state of [[Vijaya (Champa)|Vijaya]] was located around this port and the main city, which was further inland. Its centre was in the southern lowland of Bình Định. However, its architecture implies that it did not become important until the eleventh or twelfth century.<ref name=V47/>
	
Vijaya's architecture also distinguishes it from other Champa centers, since it used a combination of stone and brick elements,<ref name=V48>Vickery 2009, 48</ref> while most other Cham structures only used bricks. This suggests some influence from [[Cambodia]]n [[Angkor]].<ref name=V48/> It also points to the relative abundance of labour in Vijaya compared to other Champa centres of power, because processing stones for construction was more labour-intensive than the production of bricks.<ref>Tran 2009, 173</ref> 
	
Vijaya was involved in various wars with neighbouring countries. Major wars were fought with Angkor (now Cambodia) in the 12th and 13th centuries. Around this time Vijaya seems to have been associated with, and at times even dominated by, the Khmer King [[Jayavarman VII]].<ref>Vickery 2009, 54</ref>  Major wars with Vietnam were fought in 1069 and again in the 15th century, which eventually led to the defeat of Vijaya and the demise of [[Champa]] in 1471.<ref>Vickery 2009, 69</ref>

=== Tây Sơn Dynasty ===
The [[Tây Sơn dynasty]] originated from Binh Dinh, being named after Tây Sơn district where the rulers had come from.<ref>Kim, Tran Trong (n.d). ''Việt Nam sử lược.'' p.359</ref> The capital of Quy Nhon served as their capital until the [[Vietnamese Civil War of 1789–1802]], when the province was wracked by warfare and the dynasty collapsed.

Its Sino-Vietnamese name ([[chữ Hán]]: [[wikt:平定|平定]]) translates as "pacified" or "subjugated."

=== Nguyễn dynasty ===
[[File:Province de Binh-Dinh (1909).jpg|thumb|left|Map of Binh Dinh province in 1909]]
[[File:Bản vẽ thành Đồ Bàn (thành Hoàng đế), Bình Định năm 1913.jpg|thumb|Drawing of Đồ Bàn citadel in 1913]]

==Geography==
===Topography===
[[File:Binh Dinh scenery.jpg|thumb|right]]
The majority of Bình Định province is covered by mountains or hills. Elevations range from 0 at the coast to around 1200 meters above sea level in [[An Lão district, Bình Định province|An Lão district]] in the north-west of the province.<ref name="atlas10">''Viet Nam Administrative Atlas''. Cartographic Publishing House, Hanoi 2010</ref> While most of the mountains as well as the highest peaks are in the west, there are mountains throughout the province, even near the coast. Most districts of Bình Định have a topography that is a mix of mountains or hills and lowlands. The districts of An Lão in the north-west, [[Vĩnh Thạnh district, Bình Định|Vĩnh Thạnh]] in the west, and [[Vân Canh district|Vân Canh]] in the south-west are mostly mountainous. All other districts have some lowlands.

The largest lowland area is located in the south of the province along the lower [[Côn River]]. It encompasses much of [[Quy Nhon]], the districts of [[Tuy Phước district|Tuy Phước]], [[An Nhơn District|An Nhơn]], the western part of [[Phù Cát district|Phù Cát]], and the eastern part of [[Tây Sơn District|Tây Sơn]]. Given its size, and the access to a major port as well as Bình Định's major river, it has long been the place where most of Bình Định's people and economic activities concentrate. It was the site of [[Vijaya (Champa)|Vijaya]], one of the major city-states of [[Champa]]. The majority of Bình Định's population lives in the districts around this plain.

Other lowland areas are located in the coastal districts of [[Hoài Nhơn district|Hoài Nhơn]], [[Phù Mỹ district|Phù Mỹ]], [[Phù Cát district|Phù Cát]], as well as the inland district of [[Hoài Ân district|Hoài Ân]]. There are some hills or mountains near the coast in all of the coastal provinces, with the highest peak in Phù Cát at 874m (Ba mountain, núi Bà) and in [[Phù Mỹ district|Phù Mỹ]] at 602m.<ref name="atlas10"/>

Mountains form natural borders to the neighbouring provinces. Cù Mông pass (đèo Cù Mông) is the main border crossing to [[Phú Yên province]]. [[National Route 1 (Vietnam)|National Route 1]] passes through this pass, while there is another road (1D) along the coast. The border to [[Gia Lai province]] is the most mountainous, with the only road connection at An Khê pass (đèo An Khê) between the towns of [[Phú Phong, Bình Định|Phú Phong]] in [[Tây Sơn district]] and [[An Khê]] in Gia Lai. The border to [[Quảng Ngãi province]] is also very mountainous, with the major road and railway passing through [[Bình Đê Pass]] (đèo Bình Đê) near [[Tam Quan]].<ref name="atlas10"/>

===Hydrography===
[[Côn River]] is the largest and most important river in Bình Định. It forms a small delta north of [[Quy Nhon]]. Most of it can be used as an inland waterway for transportation. This is probably one of the reasons why a major centre of power of [[Champa]] emerged along this river. Other rivers are [[Lại Giang River]] at the centre of the lowland areas of Hoài Nhơn and Hoài Ân in northern Bình Định, [[Mỹ Cát River]] in central Bình Định, and [[Hà Thanh River]] along the valley in Vân Canh district in southern Bình Định.<ref name="atlas10"/>

The largest lake is [[Định Bình Lake]], an artificial lake mainly used for irrigation in the highlands of western Bình Định. Also in western Bình Định is [[Vĩnh Sơn Lake]] (hồ Vĩnh Sơn) at Vĩnh Sơn Hydropower Station. Other major lakes include Núi Một Lake (hồ Núi Một) in the south and Hội Sơn Lake (hồ Hội Sơn) in the centre of the province.<ref name="atlas10"/>

===Mineral resources===
[[Ilmenite]] reserves in Phù Cát and [[graphite]] reserves in northern Bình Định are substantial and support significant local export industries. There is also some gold in western Bình Định.<ref name="Atlat">''Atlat Dia li Viet Nam'' (Geographical Atlas of Vietnam). NXB Giao Duc, Hanoi: 2010</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
[[File:Binh Dinh Province Districts low.jpg|right|thumb|Bình Định province districts]]
Bình Định is subdivided into 11 district-level sub-divisions:

* 8 districts:
{{div col}}
:* [[An Lão district, Bình Định province|An Lão]]
:* [[Hoài Ân district|Hoài Ân]]
:* [[Phù Cát district|Phù Cát]]
:* [[Phù Mỹ district|Phù Mỹ]]
:* [[Tuy Phước district|Tuy Phước]]
:* [[Tây Sơn district|Tây Sơn]]
:* [[Vân Canh district|Vân Canh]]
:* [[Vĩnh Thạnh district, Bình Định|Vĩnh Thạnh]]
{{div col end}}
* 2 district-level town:
** [[An Nhơn]] (recently upgraded from district status)
** [[Hoài Nhơn]]
* 1 provincial city:
** [[Quy Nhon]] (capital)

They are further subdivided into 11 commune-level towns (or townlets), 116 communes, and 32 wards.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Statistical yearbook of Vietnam 2021 |url=https://www.gso.gov.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Sach-Nien-giam-TK-2021.pdf|page=40}}</ref>

==Economy==
With a [[gross domestic product]] per capita of 9.57 million [[Vietnamese đồng|đồng]]s in 2007, Bình Định is ranked fourth out of eight provinces and cities in the [[South Central Coast]]. While being significantly behind the main success stories of the region, namely [[Da Nang]] and [[Khánh Hòa province]], it is more developed than most other provinces in the region. It has been benefiting from its strategic position as one of the main gateways to the [[Central Highlands, Vietnam|Central Highlands]] and [[Quy Nhơn Port|its port]]. It is the region's third-largest industrial center (mainly based on furniture manufacturing) and also has strong agricultural, forestry, livestock, and fishing sectors.

In 2007 Bình Định exported goods worth US$327.3 million, while importing goods worth US$141.6 million.<ref name="GSO09"/> Most of the province's exports are furniture.

===Agriculture, forestry, fishing===
[[File:Binh Dinh farm.jpg|thumb|right|Farm in Bình Định]]
Bình Định has the most productive primary sector (agriculture, fishery, forestry) in the South Central Coast region, mostly because of its large output of rice, coconuts and its strong livestock, forestry and fishing sectors. It contributes roughly 23% of sector 1 GDP and rice output of the South Central Coast (while it has 17.7% of the region's population).<ref name="GSO09">General Statistics Office (2009): ''Socio-economic Statistical Data of 63 Provinces and Cities'', Vietnam. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi</ref> The rice harvest is the largest of the South Central Coast region but accounts only for a modest 1.62% of the national output.<ref name="GSO09"/> It has been fluctuating around 600,000t over the last few years.<ref name="GSO09"/> The average yield is 53.1t/ha as of 2009 with the highest yields around the lower [[Côn River]].<ref name="BDSO09"/>

The province's output of coconuts (95,040t) accounts for 9% of the national total as of 2007.<ref name="GSO09"/> Other significant crops include peanuts (13.7kt, 2.71%), cashew nuts (4.2kt, 1.39%), and sugar cane (185.7kt, 1.07%).<ref name="GSO09"/> Coconuts are planted mostly in the districts of [[Hoài Nhơn district|Hoài Nhơn]] (30kt in 2009), [[Phù Mỹ district|Phù Mỹ]] (27kt), [[Phù Cát district|Phù Cát]] (16.4kt), and [[Hoài Ân district|Hoài Ân]] (15.7kt).<ref name="BDSO09"/>

The livestock sector makes up 35% of the agricultural [[gross output]], a relatively high value compared to other provinces. Bình Định is by far the largest producer of pork, both in terms of total output and per capita output (over 50&nbsp;kg per capita).<ref name=Atlat/> As of 2009, there were 684,300 pigs, 288,400 cows, 18,900 buffaloes, 3 million chickens and 2 million other poultry.<ref name="BDSO09"/>

Bình Định has a large fishing sector. Its [[gross output]] contributes one fifth of the South Central Coast's total, ranking second after [[Khánh Hòa province]] (as of 2007).<ref name=GSO09calc>calculations based on General Statistics Office (2009): ''Socio-economical Statistical Data of 63 Provinces and Cities''. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi</ref> In 2009 gross output was 3.97 trillion [[VND]] or 137,466t.<ref name="BDSO09"/> In contrast to Khánh Hòa, the vast majority of this was contributed by sea fishing, with only a small share (11.1%) from aquaculture.<ref name="BDSO09"/> As of 2009, 61,900 people were employed in fishing, compared to 481,200 in agriculture and forestry.<ref name="BDSO09"/>

===Industry===
Bình Định has transformed itself into a regional center of furniture manufacturing. The industry has been successful in creating large numbers of jobs, with furniture manufacturing enterprises employing around 40,000 workers and manufacturing in total around 107,000,<ref name="BDSO09"/> making Bình Định leading in the South Central Coast in terms of industrial employment.<ref name="GSO09"/> More than two thirds of the province's gross industrial output is produced in [[Quy Nhơn]],<ref name="BDSO09"/> which is the region's third-largest industrial center after [[Da Nang]] and [[Nha Trang]].<ref name=Atlat/> [[Phu Tai Industrial Park]] is central to Bình Định's industry in general and the furniture industry in particular. Several chemical enterprises that supply the furniture and [[wood processing]] industry have been set up in the vicinity of the industrial park.<ref>People's Committee Bình Định (2007): ''Yearbook of Information on Enterprises in Bình Định Province''. Labour Publishing House, Hanoi: 162-165</ref>

The largest industries after furniture manufacturing (5290.8 billion [[VND]] in 2009) in terms of gross output are food products and beverages (2770.5 billion), non-metallic mineral products (938.4 billion), wood processing (843.6 billion), and chemical products (755.1 billion).<ref name="BDSO09"/> The latter includes not only companies supporting the furniture industry, but also a pharmaceutical industry, the most significant company of which is [[Bidiphar]], a local state-owned enterprise. Smaller manufacturing sectors include garments, paper, leather, plastics and rubber products.

[[Nhơn Hội Economic Zone]] is under construction, but behind schedule (as of September 2010).

==Infrastructure and transport==

===Transport infrastructure===
Bình Định's infrastructure has been significant for its economic development. It has traditionally been the site of a major port and the intersection of two national roads has further increased Bình Định's role as a gateway to the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] and access to the latter's resources. As a result, the province has received one of the highest infrastructure scores in the Provincial Competitiveness Index 2009, second only to [[Da Nang]] in central Vietnam.<ref name="PCI09">{{Cite web |url=http://pcivietnam.org/province_profile_detail.php?province=54 |title=Vietnam Provincial Competitiveness Index 2009 |access-date=2010-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322141057/http://www.pcivietnam.org/province_profile_detail.php?province=54 |archive-date=2011-03-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====Roads====
[[File:Binh Dinh NatRoad1.jpg|thumb|[[National Route 1 (Vietnam)|National Route 1]]]]
There are national roads with a total length of 208&nbsp;km and provincial roads a total length of 458.5&nbsp;km.<ref name="TDS">Ministry of Transport (2005): National Transport Development Strategy in Vietnam till 2020. Publishing House of Transport, Hanoi</ref> [[National Route 1 (Vietnam)|National Route 1]] runs through the province from north to south with a length of 118&nbsp;km,<ref name="TDS"/> connecting the eastern districts of [[Hoài Nhơn district|Hoài Nhơn]], [[Phù Mỹ district|Phù Mỹ]], [[Phù Cát district|Phù Cát]], [[An Nhơn district|An Nhơn]], and [[Tuy Phước district|Tuy Phước]] to much of the rest of Vietnam. A branch of it – [[National Route 1D (Vietnam)|National Route 1D]] – connects the provincial capital Quy Nhon to 1A and [[Sông Cầu]] in [[Phú Yên province]]. 20&nbsp;km of 1D's 33&nbsp;km are in Bình Định.<ref name="TDS"/> [[National Route 19 (Vietnam)|National Road 19]] runs from [[Quy Nhơn Port]] through northern Quy Nhơn, the towns of [[Tuy Phước district|Tuy Phước]], [[Phú Phong, Bình Định|Phú Phong]] to [[An Khê]], [[Pleiku]] and Lệ Thanh border gate in [[Gia Lai province]].<ref name="Road Atlas 2004">Vietnam Road Atlas (Tập Bản đồ Giao thông Đường bộ Việt Nam). Cartographic Publishing House (Vietnam), 2004</ref> This direct link from Quy Nhon to the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] and the border to [[Cambodia]] has been important for Bình Định's role as a gateway to the highlands and its industrial development, since especially the wood processing and furniture industry has relied on raw materials from the highlands, Cambodia and [[Laos]]. 70&nbsp;km of National Route 19 are located in Bình Định.<ref name="TDS"/>

74.6 percent of roads in Bình Định (including national, provincial, and district roads) are paved, which is relatively good by Vietnamese standards and significantly above the median province with 51.44 percent.<ref name="PCI09"/> However, the assessment of road quality by the local business community is not very good, with only 34.76 percent stating that roads are in good or very good condition.<ref name="PCI09"/>

Road transport is by far the most important mode of transport within the province. It accounts for between 97 and just under 100 percent of passenger and freight movements. 22.77 million passengers and 7928 tons of cargo were transported by road in 2009.<ref name="BDSO09">Bình Định Statistics Office (2010): ''Bình Định Statistical Yearbook 2009''. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi</ref>

====Railways====
The [[North–South Railway (Vietnam)|North–South Railway]] in Bình Định has a length of 134&nbsp;km.<ref name="TDS"/> All Reunification Express trains stop at [[Diêu Trì Railway Station]]. [[Quy Nhơn Railway Station]] is around 10&nbsp;km east of the main railway. It is served by a daily train from Quy Nhơn to [[Saigon Railway Station]] and a train three times a week from Quy Nhon to [[Vinh Railway Station]]. [[Tam Quan Railway Station]], located along North–South Railway in [[Hoài Nhơn district]], is frequented by only a few trains, such as the train to [[Vinh]].

====Water transport====
[[File:Quy Nhon Port.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quy Nhơn Port]]]]
Much of [[Côn River]] – almost up to the border in [[Vĩnh Thạnh district, Bình Định|Vĩnh Thạnh district]] with [[Gia Lai province]] – and a small stretch of [[Lai Giang River]] up to [[Bồng Sơn]] in [[Hoài Nhơn district]] – are inland waterways and can be used for transportation.<ref name="Road Atlas 2004"/> There has been a significant change in the use of inland waterways away from passengers and towards freight traffic between 2006 and 2008. The number of passengers decreased from 113,000 in 2006 to 42,000 in 2007 and 7,000 in 2008 and 2009, while freight transport on inland – apparently almost non-existent until 2008 – has accounted for 10 tons and around 70 tons km in 2008 and 2009, respectively.<ref name="BDSO09"/> This is, however, still minuscule compared to other modes of transportation within the province. Maritime transport within the province has shown a declining trend in recent years and was at 171 tons and 31,000 passengers in 2009.<ref name="BDSO09"/> The two main ports of the province – [[Quy Nhơn Port]] and [[Thị Nại Port]] – are both located in [[Quy Nhon]]. In 2009 they had a combined freight turnover of 4,500 tons, with 30,856 tons handled by Quy Nhon port, including 2016 tons of exported goods (mainly processed wood, furniture and stones).<ref name="BDSO09"/> Thị Nại Port, in contrast, mostly handles domestic trade. The volume of cargo handled has increased by more than 50 percent between 2005 and 2009.<ref name="BDSO09"/>

====Ownership structure====
While [[Vietnam Railways]] and the major seaports are owned and operated by the state sector, almost none of the local transport is state-run. Household businesses are dominant in the passenger sector, accounting for more than 70 percent of passengers and passenger kilometers over the last few years – although their share has been decreasing.<ref name="BDSO09"/> The other traditionally significant enterprise form have been collective enterprises. Their share has been decreasing, too, while private sector participation has been increasing from a very low base since 2008. As of 2009, the share of the collective sector (11.8 percent) is still slightly ahead of the private sector (11.6 percent), but it has been clearly overtaken in terms of passenger km, with shares of 5.4 and 23.3 percent, respectively.<ref name="BDSO09"/> The freight transport sector is dominated by the household and private sector. While household businesses take the lead in freight volume (54.8 percent compared to 41.4 percent), private companies have a larger share if distance travelled (tons.km) is considered (50 percent compared to 43.4 percent). Both private and household businesses have been able to grow and increase their share in recent years, mainly at the expense of the declining collective sector.
