'''Gaziantep''',{{efn|{{IPA|tr|ɡaːˈziantep}}}} historically '''Aintab''' and still informally [[#Name|called]] '''Antep''',{{efn|{{IPA|tr|ˈantep}}}} is a major city in south-central Turkey. It is the capital of the [[Gaziantep Province]], in the westernmost part of [[Turkey]]'s [[Southeastern Anatolia Region]] and partially in the [[Mediterranean Region, Turkey|Mediterranean Region]]. It is located approximately {{convert|185|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of [[Adana, Turkey|Adana]] and {{convert|97|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]] and situated on the [[Sajur River]]. The city is thought to be located on the site of ancient [[Antiochia ad Taurum]] and is near ancient [[Zeugma (Commagene)|Zeugma]].

As of the 2021 census, the Gaziantep province (Metropolitan municipality) was home to 2,130,432 inhabitants, of whom 1,775,904 lived in the metropolitan area made of two (out of three) urban districts of [[Şahinbey]] and [[Şehitkamil]], as [[Oğuzeli]] is not conurbated. It is the sixth-most populous city in Turkey. Gaziantep is a diverse city inhabited mostly by [[Turkish people|ethnic Turks]] and a significant minority of [[Kurds]] and [[Refugees of the Syrian civil war in Turkey|Syrian refugees]]. It was historically populated by [[Turkoman (ethnonym)|Turkmens]], [[Armenians]], [[Jews]], and [[#History 2|a plethora of other ethnic groups]].

In February 2023, the city was heavily damaged by the [[2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake]].

==Name==
Due to the city's contact with various ethnic groups and cultures throughout its history, the name of the city has many variants and alternatives, such as:
*''Hantab'', ''Hamtab'', or ''Hatab'' as known by the [[Crusades|Crusaders]],<ref name="sarafean" /><ref>[[ibn al-Qalanisi]], [[H.A.R. Gibb]], editor and translator, ''The Damascus chronicle of the Crusades'', London 1932, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ds1vuFg8j0C&pg=PA367 p. 367].</ref>

The several theories for the origin of the current name include:{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} 
* ''Aïntap'' may be derived from ''khantap'', meaning "king's land" in the [[Hittite language]].
* ''Aïn'', an Arabic and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word meaning "spring", and ''tab'' as a word of praise.
* ''Antep'' could be a corruption of the Arabic '''aīn ṭayyib'' meaning "good spring".<ref name="Darke2014">{{cite book |author=Diana Darke |title=Eastern Turkey |date=1 May 2014 |publisher=Bradt Travel Guides |isbn=978-1-84162-490-7 |pages=214–}}</ref> However, the Arabic name for the city is spelled with t ({{lang|ar|ت}}), not ṭ ({{lang|ar|ط}}).
* ''Ayin dab'' or ''Ayin debo'' in Aramaic, meaning "spring of the wolf"

===Hellenistic period===
Gaziantep is the probable site of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] city of [[Antiochia ad Taurum]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Anna Teresa Serventi |title=Una statuetta hiittita |journal=Rivista Degli Studi Orientali |date=1957 |volume=32 |pages=241–246 |language=it |quote=Aintab, Gazi Antep in Turkish, about 80&nbsp;km north-northeast from Aleppo and about 40 km from the Syrian-Turkish border, is commonly held to be the site of Antiochia ad Taurum |jstor=41922836}}</ref> ("Antiochia in the Taurus Mountains").

===Medieval history===
During its early history, Aintab was largely a [[Gaziantep Castle|fortress]] overshadowed by the city of [[Dülük]], some 12&nbsp;km to the north. Aintab came to prominence after an earthquake in the 14th century devastated Dülük.<ref name="Peirce 2003">{{cite book |last1=Peirce |first1=Leslie |author1-link=Leslie P. Peirce |title=Morality Tales: Law and Gender in the Ottoman Court of Aintab |date=2003 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520228924 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=97AwDwAAQBAJ |access-date=23 February 2023}}</ref>{{rp|22}} Following the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant]], the region passed to the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] in 661 AD and the [[Abbasids]] in 750. It was ravaged several times during the [[Arab–Byzantine wars]]. After the disintegration of the Abbasid dynasty, the city was ruled successively by the [[Tulunids]], the [[Ikhshidid dynasty|Ikhshidids]], and the [[Hamdanid dynasty|Hamdanids]].{{citation needed|date=March 2023}} In 962, it was recaptured by the Byzantines, upon the expansion led by [[Nikephoros II Phokas]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brett |first1=Michael |title=The Rise of the Fatimids: The World of the Mediterranean and the Middle East in the Fourth Century of the Hijra, Tenth Century Ce |date=2001 |publisher=Brill |page=225 |isbn=9004117415 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BqCdfhW3nVwC&pg=PA225 |access-date=10 March 2023}}</ref>

After [[Afshin Bey]] captured the fortress in 1067, Aintab fell to [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] rule<ref>{{cite book |last1=Güllü |first1=Ramazan Erhan |title=Antep Ermenileri sosyal kültürel ve siyasi hayat |date=2010 |publisher=IQ Kültür Sanat Yayıncılık |page=43}}</ref> and was administered by Seljuk emirs of Damascus. One of these emirs, [[Tutush I]] appointed Armenian noble [[Thoros of Edessa]] as the governor of the region.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Theotokis |first1=Georgios |title=Bohemond of Taranto: Crusader and Conqueror |date=2021 |publisher=Pen and Sword |pages=101|isbn=9781526744319 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1BIZEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA101 |access-date=10 March 2023}}</ref>

It was captured by the [[Crusaders]] and united to the Maras Seigneurship in the [[County of Edessa]] in 1098. The region continued to be ruled by independent or vassalized Armenian lords, such as [[Kogh Vasil]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Hovanissian |editor1-first=Richard G. |editor2-last=Payaslian |editor2-first=Simon |title=Armenian Cilicia |date=2008 |publisher=Mazda Publishers |page=33}}</ref> It reverted to the [[Sultanate of Rûm|Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm]] in 1150, was controlled by the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] between 1155–1157 and 1204–1206 and captured by the [[Zengid dynasty|Zengids]] in 1172 and the [[Ayyubids]] in 1181. It was retaken by the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm in 1218.{{citation needed|date=March 2023}}

With the turn of the 13th-century, Dülük became one of Aintab's dependencies according to geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]]. In the next century, Aintab was the capital of its district and a town with fine markets much frequented by merchants and travellers, while Dülük was in ruins, according to [[Abulfeda]].<ref name = "Le Strange"/> Still, Aintab continued to be hotly contested throughout these centuries.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|22–3}} It was besieged by the Mongols in 1270.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|23}}

It repeatedly changed hands between the [[Ilkhanate]] and the [[Mamluk Sultanate]] or the [[Dulkadirids]], a Turkoman [[vassal state]] of the Mamluks. Gaziantep was near the southern frontier of the Dulkadir emirate, and on several occasions it slipped out of their control.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|23}} The Ilkhans ruled over it between 1260 and 1261, 1271–1272, 1280–1281 and 1299–1317. The Mamluks controlled the city between 1261 and 1271, 1272–1280, 1281–1299, 1317–1341, 1353–1378, 1381–1389. It was unsuccessfully besieged by the Dulkadir leader [[Sevli Beg]] in 1390. Although the Mamluks and their Dulkadirid vassals could control 
the city from 1395 until the Ottoman conquest in 1516, the city was besieged by [[Timur]] in 1400, and then in 1420 by the [[Ak Koyunlu]] leader [[Kara Yusuf]].<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|23}}

These attacks all caused destruction and suffering among the local population. But at the same time, the city was "acquiring a reputation as a cultured urban center". [[Badr al-Din al-Ayni]], an Aintab native who became a successful diplomat, judge, and historian under the Mamluks, wrote at the end of the 1300s that the city was called "little [[Bukhara]]" because so many scholars came to study there. Ayni also left a firsthand account of the suffering caused during Sevli Beg's siege in 1390.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|23}}

Another rough patch for Aintab's people came in the late 1460s, when the Dulkadir prince Şehsuvar rebelled against the Mamluks.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|25}} Mamluk forces captured Aintab in May 1468, driving out Şehsuvar's forces; a report by the governor of Aleppo indicates that resistance had been fierce. Just a month later, Şehsuvar recaptured Aintab after four "engagements" with Mamluk forces. After Şehsuvar's final defeat and public execution by the Mamluks in 1473, Gaziantep enjoyed a period of relative peace and stability under his brother and successor [[Bozkurt of Dulkadir|Alaüddevle]]. Alaüddevle appears to have considered Gaziantep an important possession and commissioned several constructions in the city, including a reservoir and a large mosque in the middle of town. The city's fortress was also renovated, completed in 1481. These repairs were likely ordered by the Mamluk sultan [[Qaitbay]] during his tour of northern Syria in 1477; his name is inscribed above the entrance portal, perhaps symbolically marking his territory.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|26}}

The end of the Dulkadir principality came around 1515. Alaüddevle refused to fight alongside the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] at the [[Battle of Chaldiran]] in 1514. The Ottomans used this as a pretext to overthrow him, and in June 1515 he was executed.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|24}} As Alaüddevle had been a Mamluk vassal, the Mamluks considered this an affront, and the Mamluk sultan [[Qansuh al-Ghawri]] mobilized an army and marched north towards Aleppo.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|25}}

The conflict over the region meant that in Gaziantep, anxieties about the fate of the city and its surroundings must have been high. Later court records from the early 1540s provide documentary evidence of "dislocation and loss of population" as people fled; this may have been more pronounced in rural areas than in the city itself.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|30}}

===Ottoman period===
The [[Ottoman Empire]] captured Gaziantep just before the [[Battle of Marj Dabiq]] in 1516, under the reign of Sultan [[Selim I]]. In the Ottoman period, Aintab was a ''[[sanjak]] ''centred initially in the [[Dulkadir Eyalet]] (1516–1818), and later in the [[Aleppo vilayet]] (1908–1918). It was also a ''[[kaza]]'' in the Aleppo [[vilayet]] (1818–1908). The city established itself as a centre for commerce due to its location straddling trade routes.

Although it was controlled by the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] only between 1155–1157 and 1204–1206, for most of the last two millennia, Gaziantep hosted a large Armenian community. Armenians played a significant role in the city's history, culture, welfare, and prosperity. These communities no longer exist in the city due to the [[Hamidian massacres]] in 1895 and the [[Armenian genocide]] in 1915.
 
Gaziantep served a significant trade route within the Ottoman Empire. Armenians were active in manufacturing, agriculture production and, most notably, trade, and became the wealthiest ethnic group in the city,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ümit Kurt |title=The Armenians of Aintab The Economics of Genocide in an Ottoman Province |date=13 April 2021 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674259898 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgIhEAAAQBAJ&dq=ayntab+wealthy+armenian&pg=PP33 |access-date=10 March 2023}}</ref> until their wealth was confiscated during the Armenian genocide.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674247949 |title=The Armenians of Aintab — Ümit Kurt |access-date=2021-05-11 |archive-date=2021-05-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210511182316/https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674247949 |url-status=live}}</ref>

====Battle of Marj Dabiq====
At the beginning of [[Ottoman-Mamluk War (1516-1517)|his campaign against the Mamluks in 1516]], the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan [[Selim I]] brought his army to Gaziantep en route to Syria. The city's Mamluk governor, Yunus Beg, submitted to Selim without a fight and gave him the keys to the castle on 20 August.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|26}} The next day, 21 August, Selim set up camp outside the city "with great majesty and pomp" and held meetings with local military commanders to discuss strategy for the upcoming battle.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|26–7}} The fateful [[Battle of Marj Dabiq]] took place just days later, on 24 August. Gaziantep, although not an active battle site, thus played a strategic role in the Ottoman conquest of the Mamluk sultanate.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|27}}

The Ottoman victory at Marj Dabiq had profound consequences for Gaziantep, although its inhabitants had no way of knowing at the time. For the first time in almost 1,000 years, Gaziantep was located in the middle of an empire rather than a contested border region. It lost its strategic importance, but also its vulnerability to attack. For four centuries, until the French occupation in 1921, Gaziantep was relatively peaceful.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|27}}

====Economic recovery====
In the short term, though, Gaziantep was still reeling from the instability before (and after) the Ottoman conquest.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|28–9}} During that period, Gaziantep had suffered from "depredation", as well as fear caused by political uncertainty.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|29}} Besides political conflict, the city's economic slump at this time can also be partly attributed to a general decline in commerce in the eastern Mediterranean region that caused a general economic downturn in the region in the early 1500s.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|31–2}}

Only around the 1530s, when the Ottoman authorities turned their attention to the territories recently conquered from Dulkadir, do [[cadastre|cadastral records]] indicate renewed prosperity in Gaziantep.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|28, 30–1}} An important event was [[Süleyman the Magnificent]]'s successful [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1532-1555)#Campaign of the Two Iraqs (First campaign, 1532-1536)|Mesopotamian campaign against Safavid Iran in 1534-36]], which took [[Baghdad]] and increased the security of trade routes in Gaziantep's region.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|31}} As with the earlier economic downturn, the renewed prosperity in Gaziantep in the 1530s was part of a broader regional pattern of economic growth during this period.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|32}}

As a disclaimer – some of this apparent economic growth may be an artifact of using tax documents as a source. Tax assessors may have simply been doing more accurate counts in later surveys, or the government might have been applying more strict scrutiny as their control increased.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|32}} Part of this was deliberate – the Ottomans had a policy of lowering taxes in recently conquered territories, both to placate locals and to provide an economic stimulus to help war-torn areas recover.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|32–3}} Later, as their control solidified, the authorities would raise taxes again. According to [[Leslie Peirce]], this seems to have been the case in Gaziantep – tax rates in 1536 were significantly lower than the rates in 1520, which she assumes were the pre-Ottoman rates. The rates went up again in the 1543 survey, which she interprets as the Ottomans raising taxes again in the meantime.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|33}}

====Administrative changes====
The Dulkadir emirate did not simply go away immediately after the Ottoman victory at Marj Dabiq. It stuck around as an Ottoman vassal until 1522, when [[Ali Bey, Prince of Dulkadir|the last Dulkadir ruler]] "resisted discipline by the Ottoman administration". The Ottomans had him executed and officially dismantled the Dulkadir principality, annexing its territories to the empire to form the ''beglerbeglik'' of [[Dulkadir Eyalet|Dulkadir]].<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|25}}

Despite being part of the former Dulkadir territories, though, the ''[[sanjak]]'' of Gaziantep was initially put under the ''beglerbeglik'' of [[Aleppo Eyalet|Aleppo]] instead of Dulkadir. This indicates how, just as in the Mamluk period, Gaziantep was then seen more as part of northern Syria than as part of Anatolia. The area was "culturally mixed", and many locals were bilingual in Turkish and Arabic (as well as other languages). Gaziantep's cultural and economic ties were mostly with Aleppo, which was a major international center of trade.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|27}}

At some point in the 1530s, Gaziantep was moved into the ''beglerbeglik'' of Dulkadir, whose capital was [[Kahramanmaraş|Maraş]]. Even though it was now administratively part of Dulkadir, Gaziantep remained commercially more connected to Aleppo.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|27}}

====17th through 19th centuries====
The 17th-century Turkish traveller [[Evliya Çelebi]] noted it had 3,900 shops and two ''[[bedesten]]''s.

In 1818, Gaziantep was moved back into the Aleppo province.<ref name="Peirce 2003"/>{{rp|27}}

By the end of the 19th century, Aintab had a population of about 45,000, two-thirds of whom were Muslim—largely Turkish, but also partially Arab. A large community of Christians lived in the [[Armenians|Armenian]] community. In the 19th century, considerable American Protestant Christian missionary activity occurred in Aintab.<ref>American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, ''The Missionary Herald'', January 1900, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2c0WAQAAIAAJ ''passim''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230206132121/https://books.google.com/books?id=2c0WAQAAIAAJ |date=2023-02-06 }}</ref><ref>Alice Shepard Riggs, ''Shepard of Aintab: Medical Missionary amongst Armenians, Turks, Kurds, and Arabs in Aintab'', {{ISBN|1903656052}}</ref> In particular, [[Central Turkey College]] was founded in 1874 by the [[American Mission Board]] and largely served the Armenian community.

The French made the last attempt to revive the Armenian community in the city during the [[Siege of Aintab]], where the Armenians who fled the genocide were promised their homes back in their native lands. However, on 25 December 1921, the [[Treaty of Ankara (1921)|Treaty of Ankara]] was signed, and as a result, the French evacuated the city.

According to [[Ümit Kurt (historian)|Ümit Kurt]], born in modern-day Gaziantep and an academic at Harvard's Center for Middle East Studies, "The famous battle of Aintab against the French … seems to have been as much the organised struggle of a group of genocide profiteers seeking to hold onto their loot as it was a fight against an occupying force. The resistance … sought to make it impossible for the Armenian repatriates to remain in their native towns, terrorising them [again] to make them flee. In short, not only did the local … landowners, industrialists, and civil-military bureaucratic elites lead to the resistance movement, but they also financed it to cleanse Aintab of Armenians."<ref>Ümit Kurt, Destruction of Aintab Armenians and Emergence of the New Wealthy Class: Plunder of Armenian Wealth in Aintab (1890s-1920s), Ph.D. Dissertation, Clark University, Worcester, MA, Strassler Center of Holocaust and Genocide Studies, 19 April 2016, quoted in Robert Fisk, "A beautiful mosque and the dark period of the Armenian genocide", The Independent, 15 October 2016</ref> The same Turkish families who made their wealth through the expropriation of Armenians in 1915 and 1921/1922 continued to dominate the city's politics through the [[one-party period of the Republic of Turkey]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kurt |first1=Ümit |title=The End of the Ottomans: The Genocide of 1915 and the Politics of Turkish Nationalism |date=2019 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-78831-241-7 |pages=318–319 |language=en |chapter=From Aintab to Gaziantep: The Reconstitution of an Elite on the Ottoman Periphery}} "Official Turkish historiography claims that the Turkish–French war in Aintab was a heroic struggle for national independence, which earned the city glory and its grand title, ghazi (conqueror). Gaziantep's 'heroic epic' was in fact a struggle whose incentive was to wipe out the Armenian presence in the city for good. Its main motive was to ensure that the Armenians of Aintab would never be able to return to the city. Whether forcibly removed or through various administrative measures, the outcome of all of these 'struggles' rendered it impossible for Armenian repatriates to remain in their native cities, towns or villages. Hoping to make these people flee their homeland again, the brave national warriors continued to terrorise them. When the Armenians left Aintab for good in 1921–2, their leftover houses, fields, estates and other properties were sold at bargain prices."</ref>

In 2013, Turkey, a member state of [[NATO]], requested deployment of [[MIM-104 Patriot]] missiles to Gaziantep to be able to respond faster in a case of military operation against Turkish soil in the [[Syrian civil war|Syrian Civil War]], which was accepted.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Patriotlar devrede |url=https://www.milliyet.com.tr/gundem/patriotlar-devrede-1756634 |access-date=2020-10-28 |website=Milliyet |date=30 August 2013 |language=tr |archive-date=2020-10-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031061802/https://www.milliyet.com.tr/gundem/patriotlar-devrede-1756634 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Gaziantep is famous for its regional specialities: copperware and "Yemeni" sandals, specific to the region, are two examples. The city is an economic centre for [[Southeastern Anatolia Region|Southeastern]] and [[Eastern Anatolia Region|Eastern]] Turkey. The number of large industrial businesses established in Gaziantep comprise four percent of Turkish industry in general, while small industries comprise six percent. Also, Gaziantep has the largest organised industrial area in Turkey and holds first position in exports and imports.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gso.org.tr/english/default.asp?syf=industry |title=Statistics |publisher=Gaziantep Chamber of Industry |language=tr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131102742/http://gso.org.tr/english/default.asp?syf=industry |archive-date=2009-01-31 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The city is the centre of the green olive oil-based Nizip Soap industry.

Traditionally, commerce in Gaziantep was centre in covered markets known as 'Bedesten' or 'Hans', the best known of which are the Zincirli Bedesten, Hüseyin Pasha Bedesten and Kemikli Bedesten.

Gaziantep also has a developing tourist industry. Development around the base of the castle upgrades the beauty and accessibility to the castle and to the surrounding copper workshops. New restaurants and tourist-friendly businesses are moving into the area. In comparison with some other regions of Turkey, tourists are still a novelty in Gaziantep and the locals make them very welcome.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}} Many students studying the English language are willing to be guides for tourists.

Gaziantep is one of the leading producers of machined carpets in the world. It exported approximately US$700 million of machine-made carpets in 2006. There are over 100 carpet facilities in the Gaziantep Organized Industrial Zone.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}

With its extensive olive groves, vineyards, and [[pistachio]] orchards, Gaziantep is one of the important agricultural and industrial centres of Turkey.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}

Gaziantep is the centre of pistachio cultivation in [[Turkey]], producing {{convert|60,000|MT|LT ST}} in 2007, and lends its name to the Turkish word for [[pistachio]], ''Antep fıstığı'', meaning "Antep nut".

Gaziantep is the main centre for pistachio processing in Turkey, with some 80% of the country's pistachio processing (such as shelling, packaging, exporting, and storage) being done in the city.<ref name="Ayaydın 2022">{{cite news |last1=Ayaydın |first1=Eşber |title=Gaziantep ve Şanlıurfa arasında ismi paylaşılamayan lezzet: Fıstık |url=https://www.aa.com.tr/tr/yasam/gaziantep-ve-sanliurfa-arasinda-ismi-paylasilamayan-lezzet-fistik/2703938 |access-date=24 December 2022 |work=[[Anadolu Agency]] |date=10 June 2022 |archive-date=24 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221224050717/https://www.aa.com.tr/tr/yasam/gaziantep-ve-sanliurfa-arasinda-ismi-paylasilamayan-lezzet-fistik/2703938 |url-status=live}}</ref> "Antep fıstığı" is a protected [[geographical indication]] in Turkey; it was registered under this status in 2000.<ref name="Ayaydın 2022"/>

Since the Syrian civil war began in 2011, Gaziantep has become home to about 470,000 Syrian refugees, according to the United Nations. But even before the war, busloads of Syrians were crossing the border almost daily to shop in Gaziantep as Turkey pushed stronger economic ties with Syria. Syrians, who now make up more than 20 percent of the population, have transformed Gaziantep, investing and bringing business skills and cheap labor. Many of the city’s textile factories were built by Syrian migrants. Turkish and Syrian companies share buildings and workers. Hundreds of cafes, restaurants and pastry shops there cater to Syrians. There is also a large Kurdish community, mostly concentrated in certain towns and neighborhoods, Professor Casana said. Kurds have been involved in a long-running conflict with the Turkish government. The Islamic State, which has fought Kurds in Syria, has also targeted the Kurds in Gaziantep, including the 2014 bombing of a Kurdish wedding, an attack that killed more than 50 people.}}</ref> It is also inhabited by a significant minority of Kurds,<ref name="Yoon"/> about 450 thousand people,<ref name = "Güzelbey"/> and roughly 470 thousand Syrian refugees.<ref name="Yoon"/>

Pilafs in the Aintab cuisine often accompany the main dish and are not the main course alone. Traditionally, [[bulgur]] is used for the pilafs.

==Cityscape==
The historical core of Gaziantep is located on the Alleben Creek to the north and with heights to the south.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|64}} The location of the city among these heights was likely because of their defensibility.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019">{{cite journal |last1=Kuyucu |first1=Feyza |last2=Özer |first2=Yasemen Say |title=Hermann Jansen'in Planlama İlkelerini Gaziantep Kent Planı Üzerinden Okumak |journal=Mimarlık Dergisi |date=September–October 2019 |issue=409 |pages=63–7 |url=https://www.academia.edu/43324515 |access-date=21 February 2023}}</ref>{{rp|64}}

Historically, the main trade axis was the route from the castle then going southeast along the road to Aleppo.<ref name="Gurbuz Yildirim 2017"/>{{rp|8, 13}} A number of hans were built along this street.<ref name="Gurbuz Yildirim 2017"/>{{rp|8}} Due to the hot climate, the city's streets were very narrow in order to maximize shade from the buildings.<ref name="Gurbuz Yildirim 2017"/>{{rp|9}} Orientation of buildings was important so they could not see into each other's courtyards (an important private space, especially for women) and so that they would not block sunlight from neighboring houses.<ref name="Gurbuz Yildirim 2017">{{cite journal |last1=Gurbuz Yildirim |first1=Esra |title=Understanding Gaziantep's Traditional Spatial Organization in the Context of Socio-cultural Effects |journal=ATINer's Conference Paper Series |date=2017 |issue=PLA2017-2303 |pages=1–20 |url=https://www.atiner.gr/papers/PLA2017-2303.pdf |access-date=21 February 2023}}</ref>{{rp|6, 9}}

Generally, the city's population was organized according to ethno-religious groups who lived close together in the same neighborhood.<ref name="Gurbuz Yildirim 2017"/>{{rp|9–10}} Around the time of World War I, the city's population was divided between Muslims in the east and non-Muslims (mostly Armenians) in the west.<ref name="Aycı et al 2020"/>{{rp|197}} Muslims lived in the Karagöz, Çukur, Tıslaki, and Şekeroğlu districts; Armenians lived in the Akyol and Bey districts; and Jews lived in the Düğmeci and Karagöz districts.<ref name="Gurbuz Yildirim 2017"/>{{rp|10}}

An early city planning effort took place in 1891 under Mustafa Ağa, the first mayor of Gaziantep, involving a city plan and province map.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|64}} According to Kuyucu and Özer, though, the resulting maps and plans are unavailable.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|64}} Another early city plan for Gaziantep was drawn up by Barsumyan and Nazaryan in the early 1920s, during the Turkish War of Independence.<ref name="Aycı et al 2020"/>{{rp|197}}<ref name="Gurbuz Yildirim 2017"/>{{rp|11}} The Barsumyan-Nazaryan plan included an airport for the city but omitted any railway connections.<ref name="Aycı et al 2020"/>{{rp|197}} During this period, because the Jewish and Armenian communities had left the city during the war period, the city did not expand into new areas; instead, now-vacant neighborhoods were used to meet new demand.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|64}}

===The Jansen plan (1938)===
In the first years of the Republic of Turkey, new city planning laws were enacted requiring all major cities to have development plans.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|64}} In 1938, the Gaziantep municipality requested that [[Hermann Jansen]] draw up a plan for the city.<ref name="Aycı et al 2020">{{cite journal |last1=Aycı |first1=Hilal |last2=Özer |first2=Derya Güleç |last3=Güleç |first3=Abdulkadir |title=A Spatial Analysis of Gaziantep Railway and Its Station Throughout History |journal=Periodica Polytechnica Architecture |date=2020 |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=196–208 |doi=10.3311/PPar.15799 |s2cid=225257359 |url=https://www.academia.edu/44032760 |access-date=19 February 2023|doi-access=free }}</ref>{{rp|200}}{{rp|199–200}} The resulting Jansen plan was the first large-scale city planning initiative in Gaziantep, and many of its proposals were ultimately put into action.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|67}}

The Jansen plan sought to preserve the existing urban character of Gaziantep while also planning new areas outside the traditional core.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|64}} It mainly focused on new development on the north, south, and west sides of the city.<ref name="Aycı et al 2020"/>{{rp|200}} New industrial zones were drawn up along important transportation arteries, particularly the Nizip and Aleppo roads.<ref name="Aycı et al 2020"/>{{rp|200}} The most important was a 33-hectare industrial zone on the north side of town, which was to be connected to the railway network.<ref name="Aycı et al 2020"/>{{rp|200}} The new industrial area was specifically chosen to be on the northeast because the prevailing wind direction is from the northwest, so this way air pollution would not be blown over the city.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|66}}

The plan introduced several important changes to the city's transportation network.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|64}} One of the most important was the addition of a rail line to connect Gaziantep to the national rail system.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|64}} Up to now, Turkish railway construction had ignored Gaziantep (partly because of its mountainous surroundings); a national railway plan also introduced in 1938 left Gaziantep unconnected to the rail network.<ref name="Aycı et al 2020"/>{{rp|198–9}} The Jansen plan represented the first major proposal to construct a railway to Gaziantep.<ref name="Aycı et al 2020"/>{{rp|200}} Jansen wanted to put the train station on the north side of the city, for multiple reasons.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|64–5}} First, because the topography on the north side is flatter; and second, because putting a railway on the south side would separate the old town from the new planned residential areas further south, which Jansen wanted to avoid.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|65}}

Jansen also planned significant changes to the city's streets, opening up several new boulevards and widening pre-existing streets to help make a continuous transportation network.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|65}} He proposed combining the Narlı and Aleppo roads into İsmet İnönü Caddesi, which was to be the main transportation axis of the city.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|65}} The existing commercial axis along the Aleppo road, lined with hans and marketplaces, was to be expanded with new commercial buildings along the new İnönü Cd.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|65–6}} The plan also sought to create a SW-NE axis connecting the Kilis and Nizip roads by way of İstasyon Caddesi in the north and Atatürk Caddesi in the west; this axis would also be connected to İnönü Cd.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|65}} Two important pre-existing streets in the old town, Suburcu Cd and Eski Saray Cd, would also be expanded and connected with these other streets.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|65}} Finally, besides road and rail, Jansen also proposed the construction of an airport on the west side of town.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|65}}

One of the most important features of the Jansen Plan was the designation of a [[green belt]] along Alleben Creek, running east–west across the entire city, where no construction was to take place.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|66}} This would provide a large open recreational area.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|66}} Jansen also proposed a large area to the north of the creek to be used for sports fields and a hippodrome, although these were never built.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|66}}

The Jansen plan zoned for new residential areas to the south of the old city.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|65}} This may have been done to follow the pre-existing main axis along the southbound Aleppo road.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|65}} It may have also been because Jansen wanted the existing houses of the old city to be visible from the south.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|65}} He wanted to build new residential areas in a similar fashion, with two-story houses arranged on parallel streets that followed the slope of hills.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|65}} In order to provide space for the southward residential expansion, Jansen proposed that the pre-existing cemetery on the south side of town be moved to a new planned location in the northeast.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|65–6}}

To the northwest of the old city, Jansen wanted to build one-story houses among vineyards in a low-density agricultural area.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|65}} The proposed workers' quarter, in the northeast near the planned industrial zone, was to follow a similar plan, with low-cost single-story houses.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|65}}

For the city's new administrative buildings, Jansen chose to develop the Çukurbostan area, located in the old city center but with some vacant space available.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|66}} In a departure from his typical policy of not modifying the old urban fabric, also proposed demolishing some existing buildings and altering the pre-existing street layout to accommodate this new construction.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|66}}

====Impact====
Many elements of the Jansen plan were ultimately put into action, and it had a significant influence on how Gaziantep was built during the 20th century.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|66}} It especially shaped the city's transport network: the construction of a rail line on the north side, the opening of new transportation axes such as İnönü Cd, and the expansion of existing roads were all realized.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|66}} The expansion of commercial areas along the old Aleppo road led to the development of İnönü Cd as one of the city's main commercial axes, a role it still plays today.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|66}} The airport area he proposed, however, was never built – in the 1950s, as urbanization and population growth created new demand, the area was turned into a residential zone instead.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|66}}

The planned residential expansion to the south did take place, as did the proposed relocation of the cemetery to the northeast, but ultimately the main direction of residential expansion shifted to the northwest instead.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|66}} This is partly because the hilly area to the south is less conducive for construction.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|67}} The industrial zone on the northeast was built, but the adjacent workers' quarter never materialized.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|66}} Although the recreational areas to the north were never built, the Alleben green belt became an important green space in the city, and it remains to this day (although some of it has since been turned over for new construction).<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|66}} Jansen's recommendation of low-rise development also succeeded at preserving the silhouette of the city until the 1970s.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|66}}

One failing of the Jansen plan was that it significantly underestimated the population growth of the city during the next 50 years, particularly after 1945.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|66}} This lack led to the growth of uncontrolled, unplanned settlements in the city.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|67}} In addition, Jansen's general non-intervention policy with the old city center proved insufficient to maintain its character – in the absence of managed oversight, many old buildings ended up deteriorating, ultimately getting demolished, and then being replaced with new structures that architecturally did not blend in.<ref name="Kuyucu and Özer 2019"/>{{rp|67}}

===The Aru-Söylemezoğlu plan (1955)===
By the 1950s, Gaziantep's rapid growth was outpacing the Jansen plan's limits, resulting in the creation of unplanned settlements (such as Karşıyaka in the north and Düztepe in the south) and prompting the creation of a new city plan.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018">{{cite journal |last1=Yenice |first1=M. Serhat |last2=Karadayı Yenice |first2=Tülay |title=Gaziantep Kenti Planlama Deneyimleri Üzerine Bir Süreç Değerlendirmesi |journal=Gaziantep University Journal of Social Sciences |date=2018 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=552–62 |doi=10.21547/jss.374644 |url=https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/pub/jss/issue/36349/374644 |access-date=21 February 2023|doi-access=free }}</ref>{{rp|556}} This plan, drawn up by Kemal Ahmet Aru and Hamit Kemali Söylemezoğlu in 1955, continued the basic principles of the Jansen plan while adding some revisions.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|556}} The city's shape remained compact and focused around a single center, which was now being extended towards the south and west.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|556–7}}

The main goal of the Aru-Söylemezoğlu plan was to provide new housing to meet the needs of the growing urban population.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|560}} There was also an effort to shift from agriculturally-oriented economy to industrial.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|560}}

Among the important features introduced in the Aru-Söylemezoğlu plan were the railway station, now in its current location, and the addition of the new İpek Yolu highway as a northwards continuation of İstasyon Cd.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|556}} The new planned upscale residential neighborhoods of Bahçelievler, Kavaklık, and Öğretmenevleri signalled a shift towards building new neighborhoods to the southwest.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|556}} Ordu Cd, a westward extension of Atatürk Cd, was opened up, and the Kilis-Aleppo axis shifted to this route.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|556–7}} In general, the Aru-Söylemezoğlu plan planned a grid plan for the city's streets.<ref name="Gurbuz Yildirim 2017"/>{{rp|10}}

The area north of Alleben Creek, which under the Jansen plan had been designated as recreational areas, were converted into residential development under Aru-Söylemezoğlu plan.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|557}} Several small new industrial areas were also developed around Nizip Cd, Araban Yolu, and İpek Yolu.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|556}}

===The Can plan (1973)===
In 1973, a competition was organized under the supervision of İller Bank to draft a third city zoning plan for Gaziantep; it was held simultaneously with ones in Konya and Kayseri.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|557}} The Gaziantep contest was won by a team led by Zühtü Can and also including Yalçın Alaybeyoğlu, Abdullah Dellaloğlu, Müzeyyen Can, and Haluk Aral.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|557}} The resulting Can plan consisted of several stages guiding the city's development until a target year of 1995, when they projected a population of 1 million for Gaziantep.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|557}}

The Can plan focused on developing Gaziantep as an industrial center, with an increasing share of land dedicated to industrial use.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|557}} These industrial areas were also increasingly set apart from residential areas.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|561}} The Can plan envisioned a three-pole city with industrial areas at the west and east ends and new residential development in the south.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|557}} Gaziantep's Organized Industrial Zone had been established in 1969 and was one of the first in Turkey.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|558}} By 1978, manufacturing had reached 11.6% of Gaziantep's GDP,<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|561}} compared to about 17% for the country as a whole.<ref name="World Bank manufacturing">{{cite web |title=Manufacturing, value added (% of GDP) - Turkiye |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.IND.MANF.ZS?locations=TR |website=[[World Bank]] |access-date=22 February 2023}}</ref>

The 1970s were Gaziantep's highest period of immigration.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|558}} New residential development during this period was clustered into two main areas.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|558}} The first area was neighborhoods on the south and east sides of town like Karşıyaka, Düztepe, and Çıksorut, where many manufacturing jobs were available.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|558}} The second consisted of areas on the north and west where relatively higher-income people who worked in the service sector lived.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|558}} The patterns for urban development differed between these two areas.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|558}} In the south and east, there was an irregular settlement pattern formed by purchasing land around factories.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|558}} In the north and west, there was a regular grid of wide streets lined with houses and apartment complexes.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|558}}

Beginning in the mid-1980s, the Can plan was undermined by illegal building and [[construction amnesty|zoning amnesties]], which disrupted the plan's form and caused the city to grow in unplanned ways.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|558}} The municipal government tried to address the situation by performing piecemeal interventions to rehabilitate these areas, but ultimately the effect was that poorly integrated pockets of the city were formed.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|558}}

===The Aldan plan (1990)===
The problem of illegal construction in the late 80s, combined with the introduction of the [[Metropolitan Municipality Law]] and changes to national zoning regulations such as [[Zoning Law 3194]] (both giving cities increased authority in urban planning as opposed to the central government), necessitated an updated city plan.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|558, 61}} This plan, the fourth one in Gaziantep's history, was drafted in 1990 by H. Oğuz Aldan.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|558}} The Aldan plan had a target year of 2005, with a predicted population of about 1.8 million.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|558}} It planned for the city to expand to 8010&nbsp;ha, of which 26% would be residential, 22% would be industrial, and 17% would be open green spaces.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|558}}

The Aldan plan followed a metropolitan, polycentric model, with new commercial zones mixed in with the residential areas to serve as secondary urban centers.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|558}} The main directions for new development were toward the west and south.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|558}} A new [[ring road]] on the east, south, and west helped boost growth in these directions.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|558}} Some of the new secondary centers were built in the Karataş and İbrahimli areas.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|559}} Another major addition was a new commercial area on the east side of the city called the Gaziantep Ticaret ve Endüstri Merkezi (Gaziantep Trade and Industry Center), or GATEM for short.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|559}} Located on the Araban-Adıyaman highway, on the city's outskirts, the GATEM was to occupy 40&nbsp;ha and also include an intercity bus terminal.<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|559}}

===In the 21st century===
Since the 2000s, a number of smaller-scale targeted projects have taken place, such as local rezoning of industrial areas in the Ünaldı neighborhood; reworking unplanned settlements that do not meet building standards; and various other development projects (for example in areas like Bağlarbaşı, Geneyik, Sarıgüllük, Halep Bulvarı, Kilis Yolu, and Orta Tepe).<ref name="Yenice and Yenice 2018"/>{{rp|559–60}}
