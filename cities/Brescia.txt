Among the major companies based in the Brescia metro area there are utility company [[A2A]], automotive manufacturer OMR, steel producers [[Gruppo Lucchini|Lucchini]] and Alfa Acciai, machine tools producers Camozzi and Lonati, firearms manufacturers Fausti, [[Beretta]] and [[Perazzi]], gas equipment manufacturers Sabaf and Cavagna, etc.

Brescia is home to the prestigious [[Mille Miglia]] classic car race that starts and ends in the town.

In the arts, it was nicknamed ''Leonessa d'Italia'' ("The Lioness of Italy") by [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]], who selected [[Gardone Riviera]] (nearby on the shores of [[Garda Lake]]) as his final residence. The estate he built (largely thanks to state-sponsored funding), il [[Vittoriale degli Italiani|Vittoriale]], is now a public institution devoted to the arts; a museum dedicated to him is hosted in his former residence. Brescia is also the setting for most of the action in [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s 1822 play ''[[Adelchi]]''.

The province is known for being the production area of the [[Franciacorta DOCG|Franciacorta]] sparkling wine, as well as the main source of Italian-produced [[caviar]]. Brescia with her territory was the "European Region of Gastronomy" in 2017 and the "Italian Capital of Culture" with [[Bergamo]] in 2023.<ref>{{cite news | title= Anche Brescia nella Regione europea della gastronomia | newspaper= {{Lang|it|Corriere della Sera}} | date=13 July 2015 |language=it| url =http://brescia.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/15_luglio_13/anche-brescia-regione-europea-gastronomia-fb75ec00-296e-11e5-8a16-f989e7f12ffa.shtml | first=Federica| last=Bandirali|access-date=13 June 2016}}</ref>

Various myths relate to the founding of Brescia: one assigns it to [[Hercules]], while another attributes its foundation as ''Altilia'' ("the other Ilium") by a fugitive from the siege of [[Troy]]. According to another myth, the founder was the king of the [[Ligures]], [[Cycnus of Liguria|Cidnus]], who had invaded the [[Padan Plain]] in the late [[Bronze Age]]. ''Colle Cidneo'' (Cidnus's Hill) was named after that version, and it is the site of the medieval castle. This myth seems to have a grain of truth, because recent archaeological excavations have unearthed remains of a settlement dating back to 1,200 BC that scholars presume to have been built and inhabited by Ligures peoples.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.turismobrescia.it/en/percorso/origins-and-roman-brescia |title=History of Brescia: the origins and the Roman Brescia |website=turismobrescia.it |access-date=2014-06-20 |archive-date=2014-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209034028/http://www.turismobrescia.it/en/percorso/origins-and-roman-brescia |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bresciamusei.com/ncastello.asp?nm=15&t=Storia+del+Colle+Cidneo |title=Storia del Colle Cidneo |website=bresciamusei.com |language=it |trans-title=History of the Cidneo Hill |access-date=2014-05-14 |archive-date=2014-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006082902/http://www.bresciamusei.com/ncastello.asp?nm=15&t=Storia+del+Colle+Cidneo |url-status=dead }}</ref> Others scholars{{who|date=October 2023}} attribute{{why|date=October 2023}} the founding of Brescia to the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]]s.{{fact|date=October 2023}}

The [[Gauls|Gallic]] [[Cenomani (Cisalpine Gaul)|Cenomani]], allies of the [[Insubres]], invaded in the 7th century BC, and used the town as their capital. The city became Roman in 225 BC, when the Cenomani submitted to the Romans. During the [[Carthaginian Wars]], 'Brixia' (as it was called then) was allied with the Romans. During a Celtic alliance against [[Roman Empire|Rome]] the city remained faithful to the Romans. With their Roman allies the city attacked and destroyed the Insubres by surprise. Subsequently, the city and the tribe entered the Roman world peacefully as faithful allies, maintaining a certain administrative freedom. In 89 BC, Brixia was recognized as ''civitas'' ("city"), and in 41 BC, 58 years later, its inhabitants finally received Roman citizenship. [[Augustus]] founded a civil (not military) colony there in 27 BC, and he and [[Tiberius]] constructed an [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] to supply it.  Roman Brixia had at least three temples, an aqueduct, a theatre, a forum with another temple built under [[Vespasianus]], and some baths.{{fact|date=October 2023}}

When [[Constantine I|Constantine]] advanced against [[Maxentius]] in AD 312, an engagement took place at Brixia in which the enemy was forced to retreat as far as [[Verona]]. In 402, the city was ravaged by the [[Visigoths]] of [[Alaric I]]. During the 452 invasion of the [[Huns]] under [[Attila]], the city was besieged and sacked. Forty years later, it was one of the first conquests by the Gothic general [[Theoderic the Great]] in his war against [[Odoacer]].{{fact|date=October 2023}}

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Brescia - Castello.jpg|thumb|left|The medieval castle of Brescia]]

In 568 (or 569), Brescia was taken from the [[Byzantine]]s by the [[Lombards]], who made it the capital of one of their semi-independent duchies. The first duke was Alachis, who died in 573. Later dukes included the future kings of the Lombards [[Rothari]] and [[Rodoald]], and Alachis II, a fervent anti-Catholic, who was killed in battle at [[Cornate d'Adda]] in 688. The last king of the Lombards, [[Desiderius]], also held the title Duke of Brescia.

In 774, [[Charlemagne]] captured the city and ended the presence of the Lombard kingdom in northern Italy. Notingus was the first (prince-)bishop (in 844) who bore the title of [[count]] (see [[Bishopric of Brescia]]). From 855 to 875, under [[Louis II of Italy|Louis II the Younger]], Brescia became ''de facto'' capital of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Later the power of the bishop as imperial representative was gradually opposed by the local citizens and nobles, resulting in Brescia becoming a [[free commune]] around the early 12th century. Subsequently, it expanded into the nearby countryside, first at the expense of the local landholders, and later against the neighbouring communes, notably [[Bergamo]] and [[Cremona]]. Brescia defeated the latter twice at [[Pontoglio]], then at the Grumore (mid-12th century) and in the battle of the Malamorte (Bad Death) (1192).

In 1138, Brescia experienced a communal revolt against the local Bishop Manfred led by radical reformer and [[Canons regular]] [[Arnold of Brescia]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=R. I.|title=The Origins of European Dissent|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1994|isbn=0-8020-7566-5|location=London|pages=117}}</ref> This revolt broke out due to the city's involvement in the ecclesiastical and political conflict that resulted from the [[1130 papal election]]. This controversial election divided the [[College of Cardinals]] and caused a schism between [[Pope Innocent II]] (who had the minority vote) and [[Antipope Anacletus II]] (who had the majority vote). During the early 1130s, when Anacletus had power over Brescia, he appointed Bishop Villanus to the diocese, but in 1132 Innocent regained control and installed Manfred. Despite Manfred supporting the reformed clergy, which Brescia had historical supported with its proximity to [[Milan]] and the [[Pataria]] reform movement in the 11th century, Manfred was cast out as he clashed with the growth of the commune and the local nobility.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Greenway|first=George William|title=Arnold of Brescia|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1931|location=Cambridge|pages=23–25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Schmitz-Esser|first=Romedio|title=Exile in the Middle Ages: Selected proceedings from the International Medieval Congress, University of Leeds 8–11 July 2002|publisher=Brepols|year=2004|editor-last=Napran|editor-first=Laura|location=Turnhout|pages=216|chapter=Arnold of Brescia in Exile: April 1139 to December 1143 – His Role as a Reformer, Reviewed}}</ref> The revolt began around 1135 and was manageable at first, but by 1138 Manfred was forced to seek papal support and left for Rome. Arnold is believed to have joined the revolt around this time, as contemporary historian [[John of Salisbury]] records that Arnold only 'so swayed the minds of the citizens that they would scarcely open their gates to the bishop on his return.'<ref>{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=R. I.|title=The Birth of Popular Heresy|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1995|isbn=0-8020-7659-9|location=London|pages=67}}</ref> Manfred was therefore forced to return to Rome and was likely witness to the [[Second Council of the Lateran]] in 1139, after which he obtained Pope Innocent's support and had Arnold exiled from Italy. Arnold's home was Brescia, but he would never return to the city; instead he developed his reform ideology while in exile and continued to dissent against the Church. He worked with intellectual [[Peter Abelard]] (who he potentially studied under in the 1110s) who was condemned of heresy at the [[Councils of Sens|Council of Sens]] 1141 and went on to join the [[Commune of Rome]] in 1148, which led to his execution by [[Frederick Barbarossa]] and [[Pope Adrian IV]] in 1155.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Johnson|first=Phillip D.|title=Arnold of Brescia: Apostle of Liberty in Twelfth-Century Europe|publisher=Wipf & Stock|year=2016|location=Eugene|pages=32–42, 68–75, 85–125}}</ref>

During the struggles of the 12th and 13th centuries between the Lombard cities and the Holy Roman emperors, Brescia was implicated either in league with the emperors or against them. In the [[Battle of Legnano]] the contingent from Brescia was second in size to that of [[Milan]]. The [[Peace of Constance]] (1183) that ended the war with [[Frederick Barbarossa]] confirmed officially the free status of the ''comune''. In 1201 the ''[[podestà]]'' [[Rambertino Buvalelli]] made peace and established a league with Cremona, Bergamo, and [[Mantua]]. Memorable also was the [[siege of Brescia|siege]] laid by the Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] in 1238 on account of the part taken by Brescia in the [[Battle of Cortenova]] (1237). Brescia came through this assault victorious. After the fall of the [[Hohenstaufen]], republican institutions declined in Brescia as in the other free cities and the leadership was contested between powerful families, chief among them the Maggi and the Brusati, the latter of the (pro-imperial, anti-papal) [[Ghibelline]] party.  In 1258 the city fell into the hands of [[Ezzelino III da Romano|Ezzelino da Romano]].

In 1311 [[Emperor Henry VII]] laid siege to Brescia for six months, losing three-fourths of his army. Later the [[Scaliger]] of Verona, aided by the exiled Ghibellines, sought to place Brescia under subjugation. The citizens of Brescia then had recourse to [[John I of Bohemia|John of Luxemburg]], but [[Mastino II della Scala]] expelled the governor appointed by him. His mastery was soon contested by the [[Visconti of Milan]], but not even their rule was undisputed, as [[Pandolfo III Malatesta]] took possession of the city in 1406. However, in 1416 he bartered it to [[Filippo Maria Visconti]] duke of Milan, who in 1426 sold it to the Venetians. The Milanese nobles forced Filippo to resume hostilities against the Venetians, and thus to attempt the recovery of Brescia, but he was defeated in the [[Battle of Maclodio]] (1427), near Brescia, by general [[Francesco Bussone da Carmagnola|Carmagnola]], commander of the Venetian mercenary army. In 1439, Brescia was once more besieged by [[Francesco Sforza]], captain of the Venetians, who defeated [[Niccolò Piccinino]], Filippo's [[condottiero]]. Thenceforward Brescia and the province were a Venetian possession, only disrupted by the French conquest in 1512.

Brescia has had a major role in the [[history of the violin]]. Many archive documents very clearly testify that from 1490 to 1640 Brescia was the cradle of a magnificent school of string players and makers, all styled "maestro", of all the different kinds of stringed instruments of the Renaissance: [[viola da gamba]] (viols); [[violone]]; [[lyra]]; [[lyrone]]; [[Violetta (instrument)|violetta]]; and [[viola da brazzo]]. So you can find from 1495 "maestro delle viole" or "maestro delle lire" and later, at least from 1558, "maestro di far violini" that is master of violin making. From 1530 the word violin appeared in Brescian documents and spread in later decades throughout north of Italy, reaching Venezia and Cremona.{{fact|date=October 2023}}

Early in the 16th century, Brescia was one of the wealthiest cities of Lombardy, but it never recovered from [[List of battles of the Italian Wars#Brescia|its sack by the French]] in 1512.{{fact|date=October 2023}}

The "Sack of Brescia" took place on 18 February 1512, during the [[War of the League of Cambrai]].  The city of Brescia had revolted against French control, garrisoning itself with [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] troops. [[Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours|Gaston de Foix]], recently arrived to command the French armies in Italy, ordered the city to surrender; when it refused, he attacked it with around 12,000 men. The French attack took place in a pouring rain, through a field of mud; Foix ordered his men to remove their shoes for better traction.<ref>Baumgartner, ''Louis XII'', 220.</ref> The defenders inflicted heavy casualties on the French, but were eventually overrun, suffering 8,000 – 15,000 casualties.<ref>Baumgartner, ''Louis XII'', 220; Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 421.  Baumgartner gives 8,000 as a minimal estimate, while Norwich gives 15,000.</ref> The [[Gascony|Gascon]] infantry and [[landsknechts]] then proceeded to thoroughly sack the city, massacring thousands of civilians over the next five days.  Following this, the city of [[Bergamo]] paid some 60,000 [[ducat]]s to the French to avoid a similar fate.{{fact|date=October 2023}}

The French occupied Brescia until 1520, when Venetian rule resumed. Thereafter, Brescia shared the fortunes of the Venetian republic [[Fall of the Republic of Venice|until the latter fell]] at the hands of French general [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].{{fact|date=October 2023}}

In 1769, in the [[Brescia explosion]], the city was devastated when the Bastion of San Nazaro was struck by [[lightning]]. The resulting fire ignited {{convert|90000|kg|t lb ST|abbr=on}} of [[gunpowder]] stored there, causing a massive explosion which destroyed one-sixth of the Brescia and killed 3,000 people.{{fact|date=October 2023}}

In 1799, during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the fortress, occupied by French troops, fell to the advancing allies of the [[Second Coalition]] (see [[Capture of Brescia]]).

===19th century and later===
[[File:Piazza della Vittoria Brescia.jpg|thumb|Piazza della Vittoria, example of Italian [[Rationalism (architecture)|rationalism]], built between 1927 and 1932 by the architect [[Marcello Piacentini]]]]

In the [[Napoleonic era]], Brescia was part of the various [[revolutionary republics]] and then of the [[Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]] after Napoleon became Emperor of the French. After the end of the Napoleonic era in 1815, Brescia was annexed to the Austrian puppet state known as the [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia]].

Brescia revolted in [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|1848]]; then again in March 1849, when the Piedmontese army invaded Austrian-controlled Lombardy, the people in Brescia overthrew the hated local Austrian administration, and the Austrian military contingent, led by [[Julius Jacob von Haynau|general Haynau]], retreated to the Castle ({{ill|Castello di Brescia|it}}). When the larger military operations turned against the Piedmontese, forcing them to retreat, Brescia was left to its own resources. Still, the citizens managed to resist recapture by the Austrian army for ten days of bloody and obstinate street fighting that are now celebrated as the [[Ten Days of Brescia]]. This prompted poet [[Giosuè Carducci]] to nickname Brescia "Leonessa d'Italia" ("Italian Lioness"), since it was the only Lombard town to rally to King [[Charles Albert]] of Piedmont (and to the cause of [[Italian unification]]) in that year.

In 1859, the city was conquered by the Italian troops and Brescia was included in the newly founded [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].

The city was awarded a gold medal for its resistance against Fascism in [[World War II]].

On 28 May 1974, it was the seat of the bloody [[Piazza della Loggia bombing]].

==Geography==
{{wide image|Brescia ed il Castello dalla Panoramica.jpg|800px|Panoramic view of the city}}

===Topography===

Brescia is located in the northwestern section of the [[Po Valley]], at the foot of the [[Brescia and Garda Prealps|Brescian Prealps]], between the [[Mella (river)|Mella]] and the Naviglio, with the [[Lake Iseo]] to the west and the [[Lake Garda]] to the east (but it has also other important lakes like Idro and Moro<ref>{{cite news|title=Best 5 lakes of Brescia|url=http://www.bsnews.it/2018/04/25/best-5-lakes-of-brescia/|access-date=24 April 2018|date=24 April 2018}}</ref>). The southern area of the city is flat, while towards the north the territory becomes hilly. The city's lowest point is {{convert|104|m}} above sea level, the highest point is [[Monte Maddalena]] at {{convert|874|m}}, while the centre of the town is {{convert|149|m|ft}}. The administrative comune covers a total area of {{convert|90.3|km2|mi2}}.

Modern Brescia has a central area focused on residential and tertiary activities. Around the city proper, lies a vast urban agglomeration with over 600,000 inhabitants that expands mainly to the north, to the west and to the east, engulfing many communes in a continuous urban landscape.

[[File:415BresciaBroletto.jpg|thumb|Palazzo Broletto, seat of the [[Province of Brescia|Province]] and of the [[Prefecture]] of Brescia]]
Since local government political reorganization in 1993, Brescia has been governed by the City Council of Brescia, which is based in ''Palazzo della Loggia''. Voters elect directly 32 councilors and the mayor of Brescia every five years.

Brescia was generally considered in the past one of the most important political [[bellwether]] in Italy. Historical stronghold of [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|DC]] party, in 1994 it was the city in which was firstly experimented the newborn political center-left coalition formed by members of former [[Italian Communist Party|PCI]] and DC parties against [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s center-right coalition: that year the last secretary of [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|DC]] and former minister, [[Mino Martinazzoli]], run as mayor with the support of the leftist [[Democratic Party of the Left|PDS]] and won the election defeating the [[Forza Italia]]-[[Lega Nord]] bloc candidate, endorsed by Berlusconi. This experience is considered even today one of the bases of [[Romano Prodi]]'s [[The Olive Tree (political coalition)|The Olive Tree]] political coalition.

Since then to 2008 the center-left coalition held the largest number of seats with a partnership administration based on the alliance between the major left-wing, green and independents parties. Anyway, in the 2008 local elections the center-right coalition formed by Silvio Berlusconi's [[People of Freedom]] party and the regionalist [[Lega Nord]] won for the first time the majority in the City Council. These elections occurred the same day Berlusconi's coalition achieved an outright majority across the country. However, in the 2013 elections the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] achieved an outright majority across the city and the center-left coalition became again the major force in the City Council. In the 2018 local elections the center-left coalition obtained even the 54% of the votes on the first round and the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]], which obtained nearly the 35% of the votes, gained 15 seats out of 32 in the City Council. In the 2023 local elections the center-left coalition obtained again the 54% of the votes on the first round.

The current mayor of Brescia is [[Laura Castelletti]], a [[Center-left coalition|center-left]] [[Independent (politician)|independent]], elected on 20 May 2023. She previously served as deputy mayor for 10 years between 2013 and 2023.

Brescia is also the capital of its own province. The Provincial Council is seated in ''Palazzo Broletto''.

====Monumental area of the Roman forum====
This is the archaeological complex where there are the best-preserved Roman public buildings in the [[northern Italy]],<ref name= benic/><ref name= unesc/> composed of:

*''Republican sanctuary''
:It is under the Capitoline temple. It has been built in the 1st century BC and it is the oldest structure of the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]]. It consists of four rectangular rooms next to each other and inside then there are the remains of the original [[mosaic]] floors and the wall [[frescoes]], which from a stylistic point of view and state of preservation are comparable to those of [[Pompeii]].<ref name= arc >{{cite web|url=http://www.italialangobardorum.it/eng/sito/brescia/area_archeologica.asp?seza=2&sezb=6&sezc=|title=Brescia: monumental area|website=italialangobardorum.it|access-date=14 May 2014|archive-date=17 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517161951/http://www.italialangobardorum.it/eng/sito/brescia/area_archeologica.asp?seza=2&sezb=6&sezc=|url-status=dead}}</ref> Since the spring of 2015, the western room has opened to the public, while the rest of the building is still undergoing archaeological excavation and restoration.
*''[[Capitolium of Brixia]]''
:The primary temple in the city, it was dedicated to the cult of the [[Capitoline Triad]]. It was built in 73 AD and consists of three ''[[cella]]e'' that have preserved much of the original polychrome [[marble]] floors,<ref name= arc /> while their interior walls are now a [[lapidarium]] displaying ancient Roman [[epigraphy|epigraphs]] collected in the 19th century. In front of the cellae, is a fragmentary [[portico]], composed of [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns that support a [[pediment]] containing a dedication to the [[Emperor Vespasian]]. Almost entirely buried by a landslide of the Cidneo Hill, it was rediscovered in 1823 through various archaeological campaigns. During excavation in 1826, a splendid bronze statue of a [[Nike (mythology)|winged Victory]] was found inside it, likely hidden in late antiquity to preserve it from pillage. After restoration completed in 2013, the site reopened as a new archaeological park. 
*''Roman theatre''
:It is located immediately at east of the ''Capitolium''. It has been built in the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian era]] and altered in the 3rd century. With its {{Convert|86|m|ft|abbr=on}} diameter, is one of the largest [[Roman theatre (structure)|Roman theatres]] in northern Italy and originally it housed around 15,000 spectators. In the 5th century, an earthquake has heavily damaged the building. In addition, in later centuries, its remains were incorporated into new buildings built on top of it, largely demolished starting from the 19th century. Of the original structure are preserved the semicircular perimeter walls, the two side passages (''aditus'') and the remains of the ''[[proscenium]]'', as well as many fragments of columns and friezes of the ''[[scaenae frons]]''. Most of the ''orchestra'' and the ''ima [[cavea]]'' are still below ground. The archaeological excavations should resume in the coming years.

Near the ''Capitolium'' is located the ''Palazzo Maggi Gambara'', an aristocratic palace built in the 16th century on top of the west ruins of the Roman theatre.

The municipality of Brescia is part of the production areas of five different wines: a [[DOCG]] wine, i.e. the ''[[Franciacorta DOCG|Franciacorta]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agraria.org/vini/disciplinarefranciacorta.htm|title=Franciacorta DOCG, disciplinare di produzione|website=agraria.org|language=it|trans-title=Franciacorta DOCG, production regulations |access-date=14 May 2014}}</ref> three [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC]] wines (''Botticino'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agraria.org/vini/botticino-doc.htm|title=Botticino DOC|website=agraria.org|language=it|access-date=14 May 2014}}</ref> ''Cellatica''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agraria.org/vini/cellatica-doc.htm|title=Cellatica DOC|website=agraria.org|language=it|access-date=14 May 2014}}</ref> and ''Curtefranca''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agraria.org/vini/curtefranca-doc.htm|title=Curtefranca DOC|website=agraria.org|language=it|access-date=14 May 2014}}</ref>) and an [[Indicazione geografica tipica|IGT]] wine (''Ronchi di Brescia''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agraria.org/vini/ronchi-di-brescia-igt.htm|title=Ronchi di Brescia IGT|website=agraria.org|language=it|access-date=14 May 2014}}</ref>). In addition, in its old town, along the northern slope of the Cidneo Hill, there is the largest urban [[vineyard]] in Europe,<ref>{{cite news | title=Il vigneto Pusterla rinasce e torna alla famiglia Capretti | newspaper=Bresciaoggi | date=11 September 2012 | language=it | trans-title=The vineyard Pusterla reborn and returns to the family Capretti. | url=http://www.bresciaoggi.it/stories/Cronaca/406729_il_vigneto_pusterla_rinasce_e_torna_alla_famiglia_capretti/ | first=Michela | last=Bono | access-date=14 May 2014 | archive-date=26 February 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226060707/http://www.bresciaoggi.it/stories/Cronaca/406729_il_vigneto_pusterla_rinasce_e_torna_alla_famiglia_capretti/ | url-status=dead }}</ref> characterized by the cultivation of ''Invernenga'', a local white grape variety present in Brescia since Roman times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slowfood.it/sloweb/3E6E345B18d4b1BDE9kwX34A439A/un-bianco-ultracentenario-nel-cuore-di-brescia|title=Un bianco ultracentenario nel cuore di Brescia.|website=slowfood.it|language=it|trans-title=A centuries-old white wine in the heart of Brescia.|url-status=dead|access-date=14 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225141905/http://www.slowfood.it/sloweb/3E6E345B18d4b1BDE9kwX34A439A/un-bianco-ultracentenario-nel-cuore-di-brescia|archive-date=25 February 2014}}</ref>

Another very important sector is the production of [[olive oil]], especially in the nearby area of Lake Garda. The European Union has recorded as [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|PDO]] two typologies of extra virgin olive oils and they are ''Garda'' and ''Laghi lombardi''.

Brescia is also the homeland of Italian [[caviar]]. In [[Calvisano]], about {{convert|30|km}} south of the city centre, is located the world's largest sturgeons farm<ref>{{cite news|first=Jane|last=Black|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/26/world/americas/26iht-caviar.2943297.html|title=Caviar from farms instead of the seas|newspaper=The New York Times |date=26 September 2006 |access-date=31 July 2015}}</ref> that produces annually {{Convert|25|t|LT ST}} of caviar exported all over the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.quibrescia.it/cms/2015/03/26/e-brescia-la-capitale-mndiale-del-caviale/|title=E' Brescia la capitale mondiale del caviale|language=it|trans-title=Brescia is the world capital of caviar|website=quibrescia.it |date=26 March 2015 |access-date=31 July 2015}}</ref>

===Industry and services===
[[File:Rascacielos Crystal Palace Brescia.JPG|thumb|left|220px|[[Brescia Due|The business district of Brescia]]]]

The main industrial activities of Brescia are those mechanical, specialized in the production and distribution of machine tools. Also important is the production of [[motor vehicle]], represented by the [[Officine Meccaniche|OM]], which is the manufacturer of [[Iveco]] trucks, and the production of [[weapons]], among which the Fausti, [[Beretta]], Fabarm and [[Perazzi]]. Very important is the metallurgical industry. On the outskirts of town, there are two steel mills: the "Alfa Acciai" and "Ori Martin". Other crucial industrial activities are the production of [[cutlery]] and [[faucets]], along with the textile, footwear and clothing, as well as the production of [[building materials]] and [[bricks]]. The intense industrial development has resulted in a high level of pollution in the outskirts of the city located near the disused chemical factory "Caffaro" that produced PCB. For this reason, this part of the city is in the list of SIN – Siti di Interesse Nazionale (Sites of National Interest). According to a study carried out by the Edison Foundation and [[General Confederation of Italian Industry|Confindustria]] in 2015, Brescia is the province with the highest value added by industry in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brescia capitale dell'industria in Europa – BIE |url=https://www.fierabie.com/it/brescia-capitale-dellindustria-in-europa/}}</ref>

Brescia hosts the headquarters of several industry groups, including the [[Gruppo Lucchini|Lucchini]] Group, the Feralpi and the Camozzi Group. Brescia is also home to the [[A2A]] Group (the result of the merger of ASM Brescia, AEM Milano and AMSA).

The financial sector is also a major employer, with the presence of several branches of banks and financial assets. The [[UBI Banca]] Group, fourth largest banking group in Italy, has several division headquarters in the city.

===Tourism===
[[File:Contrada Pozzo dell'Olmo bRESCIA.jpg|thumb|upright|A street in the old town]]

The significant historical and artistic heritage of Brescia (since 2011 in the UNESCO World Heritage list) and the natural beauties of its surrounding area (like the [[Lake Garda]], the [[Val Camonica]] and the [[Lake Iseo]]) have allowed the city to attract an increasing number of visitors. In 10 years, the number of tourists who visited Brescia has almost doubled from 142,556 in 2003<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asr-lombardia.it/RSY/tourism/flows-of-tourists/lombardia-and-provinces/tables/12193/2003/|title=RSY Lombardia-Arrivals and nights spent by guests in accommodation establishments, by type of resort and by type of establishment.

Additionally, Brescia is close to important tourist destinations ([[Milan]] can be directly reached in 45 minutes by train, [[Venice]] and [[Florence]] in about 2 hours) and is one of the cheapest cities in Italy in terms of hotel stays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.italianvenue.com/news/2015391412-italy-hotel-rates--some-rise-some-drop/|title=Italy, hotel rates: some rise, some drop|website=italianvenue.com|date=9 March 2015|access-date=31 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222153144/http://www.italianvenue.com/news/2015391412-italy-hotel-rates--some-rise-some-drop/|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=La notte in albergo più conveniente è a Brescia |trans-title=The cheapest overnight stay in a hotel is in Brescia| newspaper= {{Lang|it|Giornale di Brescia}} | date=6 March 2014 |language=it| url =http://www.giornaledibrescia.it/brescia-e-hinterland/la-notte-in-albergo-la-pi%C3%B9-conveniente-%C3%A8-a-brescia-1.1836770|access-date=31 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Gli hotel di Brescia sono 3 volte più convenienti di Milano |trans-title=Hotels in Brescia are three times cheaper than in Milan| newspaper= {{Lang|it|Corriere della Sera}} | date=23 April 2015 |language=it| url =http://brescia.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/15_aprile_23/expo-hotel-brescia-3-volte-piu-convenienti-milano-bergamo-varese-monza-e78c680e-e990-11e4-8a77-30fcce419003.shtml | first=Matteo| last=Trebeschi|access-date=31 July 2015}}</ref> For these reasons, tourists often use Brescia as a base to explore the surrounding places.

==Transport==
Brescia Mobilità (BM) is the statutory corporation responsible for the transport network in Brescia; it operates one metro line (Brescia Metro) and 19 urban bus lines. Besides public transport, BM manages the interchange parking lots and other transportation services including [[bike sharing]] and [[carsharing]] systems.

Since 2004 in the city center of Brescia is active a traffic restricted zone or ZTL ({{langx|it|Zona a Traffico Limitato}}). The objective of the ZTL, together with a program of pedestrianizations of the main squares and streets of the historical center, is to drastically reduce the chronic traffic jams that take place in the city of Brescia, promoting [[sustainable mobility]] and public transport, and decreasing the existing levels of smog that have become unsustainable from the point of view of public health.

===Brescia Metro===
[[File:Metropolitana di Brescia - Fermata Vittoria - banchina.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A station of [[Brescia Metro]]]]

The [[Brescia Metro]] is a [[rapid transit]] network that opened on 2 March 2013.<ref name="cityrailways.it">{{cite web |url=http://www.cityrailways.it/news/la-metro-di-brescia-apre-sabato-2-marzo.html |title=La metro di Brescia apre sabato 2 marzo |website=CityRailways.it |language=it |trans-title=The Brescia Metro opens March 2 |date=5 February 2013 |access-date=15 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012193235/http://www.cityrailways.it/news/la-metro-di-brescia-apre-sabato-2-marzo.html |archive-date=12 October 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The network comprises one line, {{convert|13.7|km|0}} long,<ref name="mappe">{{cite web |url=http://www.bresciamobilita.it/public/resources/brescia%20mobilita/utenti/metrobs/linea-completa.pdf|title=Mappa della linea metropolitana |publisher=Brescia Mobilitá |language=it |access-date=7 November 2013}}</ref> with 17 stations<ref name="mappe" /> between ''Buffalora'' and ''Prealpino'', of which 13 are underground.

The first projects for a metro in Brescia date back to the 1980s, with the introduction of the first fully automatic light metro systems in other mid-size cities in Europe.
Two feasibility studies were commissioned in 1987. The automatic light metro system was chosen as the best technology for the city. The first public tender was announced in 1989. But this project was then cancelled in 1996.

In 1994, the first application for public financing was issued. The public financing form the central government arrived in 1995, while other funds arrived in 2002 from the [[Lombardy|Region]]. The international public bid for the first phase of the project was announced in 2000. The winning proposal was from a group of companies comprising [[Ansaldo STS]], [[AnsaldoBreda]], [[Astaldi]] and [[Acciona]], with a system similar to that of the Copenhagen metro.

A €575&nbsp;million contract was awarded to a consortium led by [[Ansaldo STS]] in April 2003.<ref name=rgi200804>{{cite news | title=Automation in a medium-sized city | publisher=Railway Gazette International | date=April 2008 | url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view//automation-in-a-medium-sized-city.html | author=Francesco Di Maio | access-date=19 October 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524005629/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/automation-in-a-medium-sized-city.html | archive-date=24 May 2012 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Work started in January 2004, but archaeological finds caused delays and required station redesigns.<ref name="cityrailways.it"/><ref name="opening">{{cite web |url=http://www.bresciamobilita.it/news/parte-la-metro-2-marzo-2013 |title=Parte la metro! 2 marzo 2013 |publisher=Brescia Mobilitá |language=it |trans-title=The Metro goes!

===Rail===
[[File:Stazione ferroviaria di Brescia.JPG|thumb|250px|The train station of Brescia]]

Brescia has three railway stations. The [[Brescia railway station|main station]], which opened in 1854, is located on the [[Milan-Venice railway]] and is the starting point for the [[Brescia–Iseo–Edolo railway|Brescia-Iseo-Edolo]], [[Brescia–Cremona railway|Brescia-Cremona]], [[Brescia–Parma railway|Brescia-Parma]] and [[Bergamo–Brescia railway|Bergamo–Brescia]] rail lines. The station has 15 platforms and is used by about 20 million passengers per year. Other railway stations are ''Borgo San Giovanni'' (a lesser station that is located on the Brescia-Iseo-Edolo railway) and ''Brescia Scalo'', with no passenger service and used as a freight station.

In addition there are international day trains to Zurich, and overnight sleeper services to Paris and Dijon (Thello), Munich and Vienna (ÖBB).

===Roads===
Brescia is connected with the rest of northern Italy by three motorways:
* [[Autostrada A4 (Italy)|A4]], that is the main axis connecting the city with the east and the west of the country, to cities such as Milan, Turin, Venice and Trieste;
* [[Autostrada A21 (Italy)|A21]], which connects Brescia to Turin with a more southern route than A4;
* A35, which connects Brescia to Milan and the Linate Airport with a faster route than A4.

===Airports===
Brescia is served by the following airports: 
* [[Brescia Airport]], located {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} southeast of the city

==Sports==
[[File:Mille Miglia Museum.jpg|thumb|Mille Miglia Museum]]

Brescia was the starting and end point of the historical car race [[Mille Miglia]] that took place annually in May until 1957 on a Brescia-Rome-Brescia itinerary, and also the now defunct [[Coppa Florio]], one of the first ever sport motor races.
The Mille Miglia tradition is now kept alive by the "Historic Mille Miglia",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://1000miglia.it/|title=1000 Miglia – La corsa più bella del mondo|website=1000 Miglia}}</ref> a world-class event that gathers in Brescia every year thousands of fans of motor sports and of vintage sports cars. The only cars admitted to the race are the ones that could have competed in (although they do not necessarily have to have taken part in) the original Mille Miglia. The race nowadays is not however a speed race anymore, but rather a "regularity" race; speed races have actually been banned on regular [[roads in Italy]] because of the deadly accident that killed a driver and ten bystanders in the last minutes of the 1957 Mille Miglia – that therefore became the last of the original races.<br>In recent years, many celebrities have participated in the Mille Miglia, including [[Rowan Atkinson]], [[Daniel Day Lewis]], [[Jeremy Irons]], [[Jay Leno]], [[Brian Johnson]], [[Elliot Gleave]], [[David Gandy]], [[Jodie Kidd]], [[Yasmin Le Bon]] and others.<ref>{{cite news|first=Matthew|last=Bell|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/the-mille-miglia-buckle-up-for-an-exhilarating-grand-tour-9323484.html|title=The Mille Miglia: Buckle up for an exhilarating grand tour|newspaper=The Independent |date=4 May 2014 |access-date=31 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Benjamin|last=Preston|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/20/automobiles/mille-miglia-celebrates-cars-from-motorsports-history.html|title=Mille Miglia Celebrates Cars From Motorsports History|newspaper=The New York Times |date=19 May 2014 |access-date=31 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Harvey|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/motoring/34166/mille-miglia-bruised-and-blistered.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521212624/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/motoring/34166/mille-miglia-bruised-and-blistered.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 May 2014|title=Mille Miglia: bruised and blistered|newspaper=The Telegraph |date=21 May 2014 |access-date=31 July 2015}}</ref>

===Fountains===
For many years Brescia has been considered a "city of water" due to the presence of many canals and natural waterways, as the French author [[Paul de Musset]] (1804–1880) once wrote: "The wide streets and numerous fountains give it an air of a big city. Water gushes in the squares and circulates in private homes almost as abundantly as in Rome".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oltreiltondino.it/event/brescia-citta-dacqua-primo-itinerario-dalleta-romana-al-medioevo/|title=Brescia città d'acqua|website=oltreiltondino.it|language=it|trans-title=Brescia city of water.|url-status=dead|access-date=26 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200226105852/https://www.oltreiltondino.it/event/brescia-citta-dacqua-primo-itinerario-dalleta-romana-al-medioevo/|archive-date=26 February 2020}}</ref>
