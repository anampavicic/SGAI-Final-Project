'''Mandalay Region''' ({{langx|my|မန္တလေးတိုင်းဒေသကြီး}}, {{IPA-my|máɰ̃dəlé táiɰ̃ dèθa̰ dʑí|pron}}; formerly '''Mandalay Division''') is an [[administrative divisions of Myanmar|administrative division]] of [[Myanmar]]. It is located in the center of the country, bordering [[Sagaing Region]] and [[Magway Region]] to the west, [[Shan State]] to the east, and [[Bago Region]] and [[Kayin State]] to the south. The regional capital is [[Mandalay]]. To the south of the region lies the national capital of [[Naypyidaw]]. The division consists of eleven districts,<ref name="mdy">{{cite web|url=https://www.mlis.gov.mm/lsScPop.do?lawordSn=17846|language=Burmese|title=မန္တလေးတိုင်းဒေသကြီးအတွင်းရှိ ခရိုင်အမည်များ တိုးချဲ့ပြင်ဆင်ဖွဲ့စည်းခြင်း}}</ref> which are subdivided into 28 townships and 2,320 wards and village-tracts.

Mandalay Region is important in [[Economy of Myanmar|Myanmar's economy]], accounting for 15% of the national economy. It is under the administration of the [[Mandalay Region Government]].

==History==
The history of Mandalay Region is the same as that of much of [[Upper Myanmar]] except that for much of Burmese history, the political power emanated out of royal capitals located in Mandalay Region. The country's present capital, [[Naypyidaw]], and most former royal capitals of the Burmese nation—[[Bagan]], [[Inwa|Ava]], [[Amarapura]], [[Mandalay]]—are all located here.
[[File:Mandalay Region and Naypyidaw UT.svg|thumb|Mandalay Region and Naypyidaw Union Territory]]

The [[Tibeto-Burman]] speaking [[Pyu people|Pyu]] were the first historical people to dominate the [[Dry Zone (Myanmar)|Dry Zone]] in central Myanmar that includes Mandalay Region as early as the 1st century AD. By the early 9th century, the Pyu were decimated in a series of wars with the Nanzhao kingdom from Yunnan. The Burmans, who had been migrating into the region from [[Yunnan]] in the 9th century, founded a city of their own, Pagan, in 849. The [[Pagan Kingdom|Pagan dynasty]] gradually came to dominate the central zone over the next two centuries, and by the late 11th century, all of present-day Myanmar. The [[Burmese language]] and [[Burmese script|script]] came to prominence with royal patronage of Pagan kings.

After the fall of Pagan to the [[Mongols]] in 1287, parts of central Myanmar came to be controlled by a series of rulers: the Mongols (1287-c.1303), Myinsaing (1298–1313), Pinya (1313–1364), and Sagaing (1315–1364). In 1364, [[Ava Kingdom|Ava kingdom]] led by Burmanized Shan kings reunified all of central Myanmar. Central Myanmar was under Ava's control until 1527, and under the Shans of Monhyin (1527–1555). Burmese literature and culture came into its own during this era. Central Myanmar was part of the [[Taungoo dynasty|Taungoo kingdom]] from 1555 to 1752. Parts of the region fell briefly to the Mons of Pegu (Bago) (1752–1753). [[Konbaung dynasty]] ruled the region until December 1885 when it lost all of Upper Myanmar in the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War]].

The [[British Burma|British]] administration organized seven divisions in Upper Myanmar: Mandalay, Meiktila, Minbu, Sagaing, and the Federated Shan States (North and South). Mandalay Division included what is now [[Kachin State]]. Circa 1940, Meiktila Division was merged with Mandalay Division. Much of Upper Myanmar, including Mandalay Division, was under the [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] rule during [[World War II]] between May 1942 and March 1945. When the country gained independence from the United Kingdom in January 1948, the Myikyina and Bhamo districts were carved out to form Kachin State.<ref name=md>{{cite web | url=http://www.statoids.com/umm.html | title=Myanmar Divisions | access-date=2009-04-10 | publisher=Statoids}}</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
Before 2010, Mandalay Region consists of 8 districts. Later the Pyinmana district was formed as Union Territory under the direct administration of president. So Mandalay Region remains 28 townships organized into eleven districts.

The general state of health care in Myanmar is poor. The military government spends between 0.5% to 3% of the country's GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=108&subsecID=900003&contentID=254167 |title=PPI: Almost Half of All World Health Spending is in the United States |date=2007-01-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205231908/http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=108&subsecID=900003&contentID=254167 |archive-date=2008-02-05 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/06/28_Burma.shtml 06.28.2007 | title=Burma junta faulted for rampant diseases | date=2007-06-28 | author=Yasmin Anwar | publisher=UC Berkeley News}}</ref> Although health care is nominally free, in reality patients have to pay for medicine and treatment even in public clinics and hospitals.

In 2005, Mandalay Region's public health care system had slightly over 1,000 doctors and about 2,000 nurses working in 44 hospitals and 44 health clinics. Over 30 of the hospitals had less than 100 beds.<ref name="nlm"/> Since almost all of large public hospitals and private hospitals, and doctors are located in Mandalay, these low numbers for a division with 7.7 million are actually even worse in the rest of the division, though these figures are believed to have improved by the advent of Naypyidaw as the nation's capital in 2006 although the level of improvement remains unreported. The well-to-do bypass the public health system and go to private clinics in Mandalay or Yangon in order to receive quicker medical attention and high-quality service.<ref name="mdy health">{{cite news | url=http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/health/h011.htm | title=Mandalay continues to play vital role as healthcare centre for the upper north | author=Aye Lei Tun | newspaper=The Myanmar Times | date=2007-06-11 | access-date=2009-01-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720031631/http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/health/h011.htm | archive-date=2008-07-20 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The wealthy routinely go abroad (usually [[Bangkok]] or [[Singapore]]) for treatment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/health/h012.htm |title=Medical tourism gives patients options |author=Thein Win Nyo |newspaper=The Myanmar Times |date=2007-06-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720093301/https://www.mmtimes.com/feature/health/h012.htm |archive-date=2008-07-20 }}</ref>
