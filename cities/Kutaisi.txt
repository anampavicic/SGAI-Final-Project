One of the [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|oldest continuously inhabited cities]] in the world, it is the [[List of cities and towns in Georgia (country)|third-most populous]] city in Georgia after [[Tbilisi]] and [[Batumi]]. It lies  {{convert|221|km|0|abbr=off}} west of Tbilisi, on the [[Rioni River]], and is the capital of Imereti.

Historically one of the major cities of Georgia, it served as the political center of [[Colchis]] in the [[Middle Ages]] as the capital of the [[Kingdom of Abkhazia]]<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Bondyrev|first1=Igor V|url=http://public.ebookcentral.proquest.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=2096091|title=The geography of Georgia: problems and perspectives|last2=Davitashvili|first2=Zurab V|last3=Singh|first3=V.

From October 2012 to December 2018, Kutaisi was the seat of the [[Parliament of Georgia]] as an effort to decentralize the Georgian government.

==History==
Archaeological evidence indicates that the city functioned as the capital of the [[Colchis]] in the sixth to fifth centuries BC.<ref>Gela Gamkrelidze. ''RESEARCHES IN IBERIA-COLCHOLOGY''. Edited by David Braiind (Prof, of University of Exeter (UK)) // Olar LORDKIPANIDZE CENTRE OF ARCHAEOLOGY OF GEORGIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM. P. 43 "According to the data on archaeological excavations on the Gabashvili, Dateshidze and Ukimerioni hills in Kutaisi, an urban-type settlement of the 6-5 cent. BC was found to be concentrated"</ref> It is believed that, in ''[[Argonautica]]'', a [[Greek literature|Greek]] [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] about [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] and their journey to Colchis, author [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius Rhodius]] considered Kutaisi their final destination as well as the residence of King [[Aeëtes]].
[[File:Kutaisi, 1870s.png|thumb|left|Kutaisi in 1870]]

Later, it was the capital of the kingdom of [[Lazica]] until being occupied briefly by the [[Caliphate|Arabs]]. An [[Umayyad invasion of Georgia|Arab invasion]] into western Georgia was repelled by [[Abasgoi|Abkhazians]] jointly with Lazic and [[Principality of Iberia|Iberian]] allies in 736, towards <abbr>c.</abbr>786, [[Leon II of Abkhazia|Leon II]] won his full independence from the [[Byzantine Empire]] and transferred his capital to Kutaisi, thus unifying Lazica and Abasgia via a dynastic union. The latter led the [[Unification of the Georgian realm|unification of the Georgian monarchy]] in the 11th century.

From 1008 to 1122, Kutaisi served as the capital of the [[Kingdom of Georgia]], and, from the 15th century until 1810, it was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Imereti]]. In 1508, the city was conquered by [[Selim I]], who was the son of [[Bayezid II]], the sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

During the 17th century, Imeretian kings made many appeals to the [[Russian Empire]] to help them in their struggle for independence from the Ottomans. All these appeals were ignored as Russia did not want to spoil relations with the Ottomans. Only in the reign of [[Catherine the Great]], in 1768, were troops of general [[Gottlieb Heinrich Totleben]] sent to join the forces of King [[Heraclius II of Georgia]], who hoped to reconquer the Ottoman-held southern Georgian lands, with Russian help. Totleben helped King [[Solomon I of Imereti]] to recover his capital, Kutaisi, on August 6, 1770.
[[File:View of Kutaisi (1885).JPG|thumb|left|Kutaisi in 1885]]

Finally, the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)|Russian-Turkish wars]] ended in 1810 with the [[Georgia within the Russian Empire#Western Georgia|annexation of the Imeretian Kingdom]] by the Russian Empire. The city was the administrative capital of the [[Kutaisi uezd]] and the larger [[Kutaisi Governorate]], which included much of west Georgia. 

In March 1879, the city was the site of a [[blood libel]] trial that attracted attention all over the Russian Empire. Nine [[Georgian Jews]] from [[Sachkhere]] were falsely accused of killing a Christian girl and using her blood for allegedly Jewish religious purposes.<ref name=":0" /> The trial took place at the Kutaisi Circuit Court, which had been established in 1868 as one of several new courts in the Caucasus created by [[Judicial reform of Alexander II|Tsar Alexander II.'s Judicial Reform]]. After a ten-day trial, with nearly 70 witnesses, the nine defendants were acquitted as the defense lawyers Petr Aleksandrov, Lev Kupernik and Moisei Kikodze convinced the judges that the accusations against the Jewish men were mostly based on false testimony.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Kirmse |first=Stefan B. |date=9 February 2024 |title=Russian imperial borderlands, Georgian Jews, and the struggle for 'justice' and 'legality': blood libel in Kutaisi, 1878–80 |journal=[[Central Asian Survey]] |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=171–195 |doi=10.1080/02634937.2024.2302581|doi-access=free |pmid=38903059 |pmc=11188619 }}</ref>

Kutaisi was a major industrial center before Georgia's independence on 9 April 1991. Independence was followed by the economic collapse of the country, and, as a result, many inhabitants of Kutaisi have had to work abroad. Small-scale trade prevails among the rest of the population.

In 2011, [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], the president of Georgia, signed a constitutional amendment relocating the parliament to Kutaisi.<ref>[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=23650 ''Relocation of Next Parliament to Kutaisi Endorsed'', Civil Georgia, Tbilisi, 21 June 2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913183305/http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=23650 |date=13 September 2016 }}.Retrieved: 24 November 2013.</ref> On 26 May 2012, Saakashvili inaugurated the new [[Georgian Parliament Building (Kutaisi)|Parliament building in Kutaisi]]. This was done in an effort to decentralize power and shift some political control closer to Abkhazia, although it has been criticized as marginalizing the legislature, and also for the demolition of a Soviet War Memorial formerly at the new building's location.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/georgia-opens-new-parliament-in-kutaisi-far-from-the-capital/2012/05/26/gJQAOhOGsU_story.html |title=Georgia opens new parliament in Kutaisi, far from the capital |newspaper=Washington Post |date=26 May 2012 |access-date=26 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181211070227/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/georgia-opens-new-parliament-in-kutaisi-far-from-the-capital/2012/05/26/gJQAOhOGsU_story.html |archive-date=2018-12-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The subsequent government of the [[Georgian Dream]] passed a new constitution that moved the parliament back to Tbilisi, effective from January 2019.<ref>{{cite news |title=New Constitution of Georgia comes into play as the presidential inauguration is over |url=https://agenda.ge/en/news/2018/2674 |access-date=4 January 2021 |publisher=Agenda.ge |date=17 December 2018 |archive-date=27 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201127083537/https://agenda.ge/en/news/2018/2674 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Landmarks===
The landmark of the city is the ruined [[Bagrati Cathedral]], built by [[Bagrat III of Georgia|Bagrat III]], king of Georgia, in the early 11th century. The [[Gelati Monastery]] a few km east of the city, is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. One of the famous churches in Georgia is [[Motsameta monastery]]. It is named after two saints, brothers David and Constantine. They were the Dukes of Margveti, and were martyred by Arab invaders in the 8th&nbsp; century. Besides the churches, there are other places of note such as: [[Sataplia Strict Nature Reserve|Sataplia Cave]], where one can observe footprints of [[dinosaur]]s; ruins of [[Geguti Palace]], which was one of the residences of Georgian monarchs; "Okros Chardakhi" – Georgian Kings' Palace; the [[Temple|Pantheon]], where many notable citizens are buried.

The [[Kutaisi Synagogue]] was built in 1885.

==Geography==
[[File:Downtown Kutaisi.jpg|285px|thumb|Downtown Kutaisi]]
Kutaisi is located along both banks of the [[Rioni River]]. The city lies at an elevation of {{convert|125|–|300|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Metres above sea level|above sea level]]. To the east and northeast Kutaisi is bounded by the Northern [[Imereti]] Foothills, to the north by the [[Samgurali Range]], and to the west and the south by the [[Colchis]] Plain.

===Landscape===
Kutaisi is surrounded by [[deciduous]] forests to the northeast and the northwest. The low-lying outskirts of the city have a largely agricultural landscape. The city center has many gardens and its streets are lined with high, leafy trees. In the springtime, when the snow starts to melt in the nearby mountains, the storming [[Rioni River]] in the middle of the city is heard far beyond its banks.

===Climate===
Kutaisi has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') with a well-defined on-shore/monsoonal flow (characteristic of the [[Colchis]] Plain) during the autumn and winter months. The summers are generally hot, while the winters are wet and cool. The average annual temperature in the city is {{convert|14.8|C|F}}. January is the coldest month with an average temperature of {{convert|5.4|C|F}} while August is the hottest month with an average temperature of {{convert|24.7|C|F}}. The absolute minimum recorded temperature is {{convert|−17.0|C|F}} and the absolute maximum is {{convert|43.1|C|F}} recorded on 30 July 2000.<ref name="NCEI"/>

Average annual precipitation is around {{convert|1500|mm|2|abbr=on}}. Rain may fall in every season of the year. The city often experiences heavy, wet snowfall ([[snowfall]] of {{cvt|30|cm|in|disp=x|&nbsp;/&nbsp;}} or more per single snowstorm is not uncommon) in the winter, but the snow cover usually does not last for more than a week. There are roughly 15.5 days a year with snow depth.<ref name="NCEI"/> Kutaisi experiences powerful easterly winds in the summer which descend from the nearby mountains.
