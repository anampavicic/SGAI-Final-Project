== History ==
In the early 1930s, Sodo was described as the only locality in Wolaita district deserving to be called a town. It had a Saturday market, a telephone line to the capital, and a weekly mail courier. Italian ground troops captured Sodo on 27 January 1937; it was there that two Italian generals with their divisions – Liberati with his [[Italian 25 Division|25th Division]], and Bacarri with his [[Italian 101 Division|101st Division]] – surrendered on 22 May 1941, after a minimum of resistance. The British also captured the remnants of the [[Italian 21 Division|21st Division]], who had escaped around the north end of [[Lake Abijatta]]. The loot included more than 4,000 officers and men, 6 medium tanks, 4 light tanks, 100 machine guns, ammunition and supplies.<ref name="NAI-web">[http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/A/ORTSOB.pdf]{{dead link|date=May 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

By 1958 Sodo was one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as First Class Township. A branch of the [[Commercial Bank of Ethiopia]] was established between 1965 and 1968.<ref name=NAI-web/>  The administrator of Sodo Zuria woreda and one-time student activist, Melaku Gebre Egziahber, was arrested in 1975 for encouraging peasants and the urban poor to rise up against "exploiters" in the town.<ref>Marina and David Ottaway, ''Ethiopia: Empire in Revolution'' (New York: Africana Publishing, 1978), p. 125</ref> In 1984, a refugee camp was established in the town for the victims of [[1984–1985 famine in Ethiopia|that year's famine]].<ref name=NAI-web/>

On 6 November 1999, [[Law enforcement in Ethiopia|police]] arrested two teachers in Sodo for objecting to the use of a new language in school textbooks. Student demonstrations against the arrests led to widespread week-long protests and riots. Special police units were brought in to suppress the demonstrations, and killed as many as 10 people, injured hundreds and arrested up to 1,000 others. A former [[YMCA]] camp outside Sodo was used as a temporary detention facility for hundreds of demonstrators.<ref>[https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/1999/246.htm "Ethiopia: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices"], Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, US State Department (accessed 8 July 2009)</ref>

Amnesty International included this incident as one of a series of government intimidation of opposition party activists.<ref>[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr25/002/2005/en/ "Ethiopia: The 15 May 2005 elections and human rights - recommendations to the government, election observers and political parties"], Amnesty International website, Report AFR 25/002/2005 (accessed 20 May 2009)</ref>
