====Public High Schools====
* ''Ligao National High School (LNHS)'' was originally named Ligao Municipal High  School, in the then municipality of Ligao, now Ligao City.  This was opened on June 20, 1980 through the efforts of the municipal officials who acted on a barangay resolution passed by several barangays which had long wished to have a secondary school.  Hence, the passage and approval of Sangguniang Bayan Resolution Nos. 15, 17 and 19 s. 1980 which stated the public demand for the opening of Ligao Municipal High School supported by municipal funds. Thus, on June 24, 1980, the Department of Education, Culture and Sports finally signed and issued Permit No. 36, s. 1980 which marked the opening of the Ligao Municipal High School effective school year 1980 – 1981. Due to the petition received by the Sangguniang Bayan, the school was renamed as Ligao Municipal Technical Vocational School which offered vocational and technical subjects that would meet the needs of the community. Sometime in 1993, LMTVS was renamed Ligao National High School under Republic Act No. 7794. Since then LNHS has gained a name for itself by the achievements it earned from academic and non – academic competitions.
* The ''Ligao City National Technical-Vocational High School (LCNTVHS)'' is located at Ligao-Sabloyon-Tabaco Road, Brgy. Nasisi Ligao City. Is a Technical-Vocational High School was established through Republic Act No. 10984, on March 14, 2018.
* The  ''Bicol Regional Science High School (BRSHS)'' was conceived by virtue of DECS Order No. 69, series of 1993. In the beginning of the school year 1994–1995, students were enrolled in Ligao National High School since BRSHS had no site of its own. The organization used the LNHS's facilities and classrooms for its daily operations. In 2000, after six years of existence, BRSHS achieved independence and completely separated from its mother school. The institution was then transferred to barangay Tuburan.
