rebelling against the rule of [[President of Ivory Coast|President]] [[Laurent Gbagbo]]. The [[coup]] was allegedly led by [[Robert Guéï]], the former [[military dictator]] overthrown in a popular uprising in 2000. Despite the formal cessation of hostilities between the government and rebels in 2003, Korhogo remains unstable, with continued fighting between rival factions. In June 2004, forces loyal to rebel leader [[Guillaume Soro]] claimed that his [[Paris]]-based rival Ibrahim Coulibaly had attempted to [[assassination|assassinate]] Soro, leading to gun battles which left 22 dead in Korhogo. In August 2004, the [[United Nations]]' Ivorian mission announced that three [[mass grave]]s, containing at least 99 bodies, had been discovered in the town.

On 29 November 2011, the [[Associated Press]] reported that Gbagbo had been placed under house arrest in Korhogo, awaiting extradition to [[The Hague]] to face charges at the [[International Criminal Court]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Ivory Coast's Gbagbo to be extradited to Hague | date = 2011-11-29 | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gasT_Msz4cwhp_sFPj57MCK5VFaA?docId=37dc0d23ca8b4a13ac1ac65b0fd1c754 | access-date = 2011-11-29}}{{dead link|date=June 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>
