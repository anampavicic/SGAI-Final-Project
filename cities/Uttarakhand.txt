The state is bordered by [[Himachal Pradesh]] to the northwest, [[Tibet]] to the north, [[Nepal]] to the east, [[Uttar Pradesh]] to the south and southeast, with a small part touching [[Haryana]] in the west. Uttarakhand has a total area of {{cvt|53,483|km2}}, equal to 1.6 per cent of the total area of India. [[Dehradun]] serves as the state capital, with [[Nainital]] being the judicial capital. The state is divided into two divisions, [[Garhwal division|Garhwal]] and [[Kumaon division|Kumaon]], with a total of [[List of districts of Uttarakhand|13 districts]]. The forest cover in the state is 45.4 per cent of the state's geographical area. The cultivable area is 16 per cent of the total geographical area. The two major rivers of the state, the [[Ganges]] and its tributary [[Yamuna]], originate from the [[Gangotri]] and [[Yamunotri]] glaciers respectively.

Uttarakhand's history dates back to [[prehistoric times]], with archaeological evidence showcasing human habitation. It was part of the ancient [[Kuru Kingdom|Kuru]] and the [[Panchala|Panchal]] kingdoms during the [[Vedic period|Vedic age]], and later saw the rise of dynasties like the [[Kuninda]]s and influence of [[Buddhism]] as evidenced by [[Ashokan edicts]]. Though primarily driven by agriculture and [[hydropower]], the state's economy is now dominated by the service industry. The service sector comprises primarily travel, tourism, and hotel industry. The Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of Uttarakhand is {{INRConvert|2.87|lc|lk=on}}. The state contributes [[List of Lok Sabha members from Uttarakhand|five]] seats to the lower house Lok Sabha and [[List of Rajya Sabha members from Uttarakhand|three]] seats and the upper house Rajya Sabha.

Inhabitants of the state are called either [[Garhwali people|Garhwali]] or [[Kumaoni people|Kumaoni]] depending on their region of origin. [[Hinduism]] is practiced by more than three-fourths of the population, with [[Islam]] being the next-largest religious group. [[Hindi language|Hindi]] is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state, along with native regional languages include [[Garhwali language|Garhwali]], [[Jaunsari language|Jaunsari]], [[Gujari language|Gurjari]] and [[Kumaoni language|Kumaoni]]. The state is often referred to as the "Devbhumi" ({{lit|Land of the Gods}}),  due to its religious significance and numerous [[Hindu temple]]s and [[Hindu pilgrimage sites in India|pilgrimage centres]] found throughout the state. Along with several historical, natural and religious tourist destinations, including [[Char Dham]], [[Haridwar]], [[Rishikesh]], [[Panch Kedar]], [[Himalayas]], and [[Sapta Badri]]. Uttarakhand is also home to two [[World Heritage sites]].

==Etymology==
{{See also|List of Indian state and union territory name etymologies}}
Uttarakhand's name is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] words ''uttara'' ({{lang|sa|उत्तर}}) meaning 'north', and ''khaṇḍa'' ({{lang|sa|खण्ड}}) meaning 'section' or 'part', altogether simply meaning 'Northern Part'. The name finds mention in early [[Hindu scriptures]] as the combined region of "Kedarkhand" (present day [[Garhwal division|Garhwal]]) and "Manaskhand" (present day [[Kumaon division|Kumaon]]). Uttarakhand was also the ancient [[Puranic]] term for the central stretch of the Indian [[Himalayas]].<ref name="autogenerated2001">Kandari, O. P., & Gusain, O. P. (Eds.). (2001). Garhwal Himalaya: Nature, Culture & Society. Srinagar, Garhwal: Transmedia.</ref>
<!-- However, the region was given the name ''Uttaranchal'' by the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]-led [[Government of India|union government]] and [[Government of Uttarakhand|Uttarakhand state government]] when they started a new round of state reorganisation in 1998. Chosen as per BJP claims for its allegedly less-separatist connotations, since the proposed state name Uttarakhand had been used exclusively in all major statehood protests. The name change generated widespread controversy among many activists and citizens who saw it as a political act meant to hijack credit from the activist party [[Uttarakhand Kranti Dal]].<ref>Negi, B. (2001). "Round One to the Lobbyists, Politicians and Bureaucrats." ''The Indian Express'', 2 January.</ref> The name Uttarakhand remained popular in the region, while Uttaranchal was promulgated only through official usage.<ref name="Name1_UK">{{cite web | title=Parliament okays bill to rename Uttaranchal | website=The Times of India | date=7 December 2006 | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parliament-okays-bill-to-rename-uttaranchal/articleshow/737781.cms | access-date=24 June 2024}}</ref>
In August 2006, [[Union Council of Ministers]] assented to the demands of the [[Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly|Uttaranchal Legislative Assembly]] and leading members of the [[Uttarakhand movement|Uttarakhand statehood movement]] to rename Uttaranchal state as Uttarakhand.

The region formed a part of the [[Uttarakuru]] Kingdom during the [[Vedic period|Vedic age]] of [[Ancient India]]. Among the first major dynasties of Kumaon were the [[Kuninda]]s in the second century BCE who practised an early form of [[Shaivism]]. [[Ashokan edicts]] at Kalsi show the early presence of [[Buddhism]] in this region.

Ancient rock paintings, rock shelters, [[paleolithic age]] stone tools (hundreds of thousands of years old), and [[megaliths]] provide evidence that the mountains of the region have been inhabited since prehistoric times.

Among the first major dynasties of Garhwal and Kumaon were the Kunindas in the second century BCE who practised an early form of [[Shaivism]] and traded salt with Western [[Tibet]]. It is evident from the [[Ashoka]]n edict at Kalsi in Western Garhwal that [[Buddhism]] made inroads in this region. [[Folk Hinduism|Shamanic Hindu]] practices deviating from Hindu orthodoxy also persisted here. However, Garhwal and Kumaon were restored to nominal [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic Hindu]] rule due to the travels of [[Shankaracharya]] and the arrival of migrants from the plains.{{Citation needed|date=December 2022}}

Between the 4th and 14th centuries, the Katyuri dynasty dominated lands of varying extents from the Katyur valley (modern-day [[Baijnath, Uttarakhand|Baijnath]]) in Kumaon. The historically significant temples at [[Jageshwar]] are believed to have been built by the Katyuris and later remodelled by the Chands. Other peoples of the [[Tibeto-Burman]] group known as [[Kirata]] are thought to have settled in the northern highlands as well as in pockets throughout the region, and are believed to be ancestors of the modern day [[Uttarakhand Bhotiya|Bhotiya]], [[Raji people|Raji]], [[Jad people|Jad]], and [[Ban Rawats|Banrawat]] people.<ref>Saklani, D.

By the medieval period, the region was consolidated under the [[Garhwal Kingdom]] in the west and the [[Kumaon Kingdom]] in the east. During this period, learning and new forms of painting (the [[Pahari painting|Pahari]] school of art) developed.<ref>Pande, B. D. (1993). History of Kumaun: English version of "Kumaun Ka Itihas".

In 1803, the Garhwal Kingdom also fell to the Gurkhas. After the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]], this region was ceded to the [[Company rule in India|British]] as part of the [[Treaty of Sugauli]] and the erstwhile Kumaon Kingdom along with the [[Garhwal District|eastern region of Garhwal Kingdom]] was merged with the [[Ceded and Conquered Provinces]].

In 1816, the Garhwal Kingdom was re-established from a smaller region in [[Tehri Garhwal district|Tehri]] as a [[princely state]]. In the southern part of Uttarakhand in [[Haridwar district]] (earlier part of [[Saharanpur district|Saharanpur]] till 1988), the dominance and kingship (rajya) was exercises by Gujar chiefs, the area was under control of Parmar (Panwar or Khubars) Gujars in eastern Saharanpur including Haridwar in kingship of Raja Sabha Chandra of [[Jhabrera (Uttarakhand Assembly constituency)|Jabarhera]] (Jhabrera). Gujars of the Khubar (Panwar) gotra held more than 500 villages there in upper Doab, and that situation was confirmed in 1759 in a grant by a Rohilla governor of 505 villages and 31 hamlets to one Manohar Singh Gujar (written in some records as Raja Nahar Singh son of Sabha Chandra). In 1792 Ram Dayal and his son Sawai Singh were ruling the area but due to some family reasons Ramdayal left Jhabrera and went to Landhaura village, now some villages were under the control of Raja Ramdayal Singh at Landhaura, and some under his son Sawai Singh at Jhabrera. Hence, there were two branches of Jabarhera estate (riyasat) main branch at Jabarhera and the second one at Landhaura, both father and son were ruling simultaneously without any conflicts till the death of Raja Sawai Singh of Jabarhera in 1803. After the death of Sawai Singh total control of powers transferred to Ram Dayal Singh at Landhaura, but some villages were given to descendants of Sawai Singh and her widow to collect revenue. {{Citation needed|date=September 2024|reason=a large number of claims without any supporting source}}

By 1803 the Landhaura villages numbered 794 under Raja Ram Dayal Singh.

Uttarakhand lies on the southern slope of the Himalaya range, and the climate and vegetation vary greatly with elevation, from glaciers at the highest elevations to [[subtropical]] forests at the lower elevations. The highest elevations are covered by ice and bare rock. Below them, between {{convert|3000|and|5000|m|ft}} are the [[western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows]]. The temperate [[western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests]] grow just below the tree line. At {{convert|3000|to|2600|m|ft}} elevation they transition to the temperate [[western Himalayan broadleaf forests]], which lie in a belt from {{convert|2600|to|1500|m|ft}} elevation. Below {{convert|1500|m|ft}} elevation lie the [[Himalayan subtropical pine forests]]. The [[Upper Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests]] and the drier [[Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands]] cover the lowlands along the Uttar Pradesh border in a belt locally known as [[Bhabar]]. These lowland forests have mostly been cleared for agriculture, but a few pockets remain.<ref>Negi, S. S. (1995). Uttarakhand: land and people. New Delhi: MD Pub.</ref>

===Climate===
Uttarakhand has a [[temperate climate|temperate]] but varies greatly from north to south.<ref name="Climate">{{cite web |title=Climate of Uttarakhand |url=https://imdpune.gov.in/library/public/Climate%20of%20Uttarakhand.pdf |publisher=IMD Pune |access-date=28 June 2024}}</ref> The climatic conditions experienced in the state vary [[Subtropics|subtropical]] in the southern part to [[Alpine climate|alpine]] in the upper reaches of the Himalayan mountain in the northern parts. The winter season from December to February, is extreme with temperatures fluctuating anywhere between  {{convert|comma=5|5|°C}} to {{convert|comma=5|20|°C}}. In higher altitudes and mountainous regions, temperatures often drop below freezing point.<ref name="Climate"/> Cold winds blow across Uttarakhand, especially in the higher altitudes and mountainous regions. These winds bring cold temperatures and often carry moisture, contributing to the heavy snowfall in places like the Himalayan ranges and hill stations.<ref name="Climate"/>

During Pre-monsoon or hot weather season from March to May, temperature starts to rise and steadily rises till it reaches its peak in May to the middle of June, when the mean maximum temperature in southern parts and valleys of the state is at about {{convert|comma=5|34|°C}} C to {{convert|comma=5|38|°C}} and mean minimum temperature is at about {{convert|comma=5|20|°C}} to {{convert|comma=5|24|°C}} C.<ref name="Daily Weather">{{cite web |title=Daily Weather Report For Uttarakhand |url=https://mausam.imd.gov.in/dehradun/mcdata/DWR.pdf |publisher=Meteorological Centre, Dehradun |access-date=28 June 2024}}</ref> June to September constitutes the [[southwest monsoon]] season and the period of October and November is of post monsoon season. The state receives rainfall mainly due monsoon depressions originating in the [[Bay of Bengal]] during the [[southwest monsoon]] season. The total annual rainfall for the state as a whole is 133&nbsp;cm and total annual number of rainy days are about 63&nbsp;cm. Although, rainfall in the state varies from place to place due to its rugged topography. Precipitation is not heavy and occurs in the form of rain and snow. Winds are generally light of the order of 1 to 4 kmph in the valleys and 5 to 10 kmph at elevations of 2&nbsp;km increasing further with higher altitudes.

=== Social groups ===
Uttarakhand has a multiethnic population spread across two geocultural regions: Garhwal, and Kumaon. A large portion (about 35 per cent) of the population is [[Rajput]] (also called Thakur) of various clans of erstwhile landowning rulers and their descendants), including members of the native [[Garhwali people|Garhwalis]], and [[Kumaoni people|Kumaonis]] as well as a number of migrants.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bhardwaj |first1=Ashutosh |title=Uttarakhand elections: Across the border; next door to UP, new caste calculus |url=https://indianexpress.com/elections/uttarakhand-assembly-elections-2017/uttarakhand-elections-across-the-border-next-door-to-up-new-caste-calculus-4525289/ |access-date=16 June 2023 |work=The Indian Express |date=15 February 2017 |language=en |archive-date=16 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230616105022/https://indianexpress.com/elections/uttarakhand-assembly-elections-2017/uttarakhand-elections-across-the-border-next-door-to-up-new-caste-calculus-4525289/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=माहेश्वरी |first1=सुधांशु |title=उत्तराखंड: जहां सिर्फ ब्राह्मण-ठाकुर जाति वाले CM बने, कांग्रेस क्यों खेल रही दलित कार्ड? |url=https://www.aajtak.in/elections/uttarakhand-assembly-elections/story/uttarakhand-election-brahmin-thakur-cm-dalit-congress-harish-rawat-ntc-1408958-2022-02-10 |access-date=16 June 2023 |work=Aaj Tak |date=10 February 2022 |language=hi |archive-date=16 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230616103521/https://www.aajtak.in/elections/uttarakhand-assembly-elections/story/uttarakhand-election-brahmin-thakur-cm-dalit-congress-harish-rawat-ntc-1408958-2022-02-10 |url-status=live }}</ref> According to a 2007 study by [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]], Uttarakhand has the highest percentage of [[Brahmin]]s of any state in India, with approximately 20 per cent of the population.<ref name=":0">{{cite magazine |title=Brahmins in India |url=http://outlookindia.com/article/Brahmins-In-India/234783 |magazine=[[Outlook (Indian magazine)|Outlook]] |date=4 June 2007 |access-date=17 July 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531222946/http://www.outlookindia.com/article/Brahmins-In-India/234783 |archive-date=31 May 2014}}</ref> Uttarakhand is among the few Indian states where the historic [[Forward caste|Upper Caste]] forms a major share of the population.<ref name=":0" />

The official language of Uttarakhand is [[Hindi]],<ref name="2011lang" /> which according to the 2011 census is spoken natively by {{sigfig|43.365|2}} per cent of the population,<ref name="census2011-C16">{{Cite web|title=Table C-16 Population by Mother Tongue: Uttarakhand|url=https://censusindia.gov.in/nada/index.php/catalog/10225/download/13337/DDW-C16-STMT-MDDS-0500.XLSX|website=www.censusindia.gov.in|publisher=[[Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India]]|access-date=23 July 2022|archive-date=9 August 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220809134456/https://censusindia.gov.in/nada/index.php/catalog/10225/download/13337/DDW-C16-STMT-MDDS-0500.XLSX|url-status=live}} Figures for Jaunsari also include speakers of Jaunpuri.</ref> and also used throughout the state as a lingua franca.

The major regional languages of Uttarakhand are [[Garhwali language|Garhwali]], which according to the 2011 census is spoken by {{sigfig|23.025|2}} per cent of the population, mostly in the western half of the state, [[Kumaoni language|Kumaoni]], spoken in the eastern half and native to {{sigfig|19.941|2}} per cent, and [[Jaunsari language|Jaunsari]], whose speakers are concentrated in Dehradun district in the southwest and make up {{sigfig|1.345|2}} per cent of the state's population. These three languages are closely related, with Garhwali and Kumaoni in particular making up the [[Central Pahari]] language subgroup. The languages have been part of various scattered conservation efforts due to their active decline beginning in the later quarter of the 20th century. The decline is hypothesized to be the result of heavy state-sponsored promotion of Hindi as the official language.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Chatterjee |first=Garga |date=21 February 2016 |title=Why imposing Hindi on all is as bad an idea as insisting that India is a Hindu country |url=http://scroll.in/article/803869/why-imposing-hindi-on-all-is-as-bad-an-idea-as-insisting-that-india-is-a-hindu-country |access-date=14 February 2024 |website=Scroll.in |language=en-US |archive-date=3 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221003212604/https://scroll.in/article/803869/why-imposing-hindi-on-all-is-as-bad-an-idea-as-insisting-that-india-is-a-hindu-country |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Bal mithai.jpg|thumb|[[Bal Mithai]], a popular sweet from Kumaon]]

The primary food of Uttarakhand is vegetables with wheat being a staple, although non-vegetarian food is also served. A distinctive characteristic of Uttarakhand cuisine is the sparing use of tomatoes, milk, and milk-based products.

Coarse grain with high fibre content is very common in Uttarakhand due to the harsh terrain. Crops most commonly associated with Uttarakhand are [[Buckwheat]] (locally called ''Kotu'' or ''Kuttu'') and the regional crops, ''Maduwa'' and ''Jhangora'', particularly in the interior regions of Kumaon and Garhwal. Generally, either [[Ghee|Desi Ghee]] or [[Mustard oil]] is used for the purpose of cooking food. Simple recipes are made interesting with the use of hash seeds ''[[Jakhya]]'' as spice, [[chutney]] made of [[Bhang]] is also a regional cuisine.

[[Bal Mithai]] is a popular fudge-like sweet. Other popular dishes include Dubuk, Chains, Kap, Bhatiya, Jaula, Phana, Paliyo, Chutkani and Sei. In sweets; Swal, Ghughut/Khajur, Arsa, [[Rock candy|Mishri]], Gatta and [[Gulgula (doughnut)|Gulgulas]] are popular.

Many regional variations of [[Kadhi]] called ''Jhoi'' or ''Jholi'' is also popular.<ref>Subodh Upadhyay, ''An Essence of Himalaya'', a book about Uttarakhand cuisine</ref> Another staple of the Kumaon region is a black soybean dal referred to as ''Bhatt'' or ''chudkani''. A grinded dal ''chaisu'' is also popular in the Garhwal region.

The state has a predominant non-vegetarian population, with some estimates suggesting 75% of the population being non-vegetarian. Various boar, chicken, mutton and hare recipes are popular in the region. A popular mutton dish ''bhutwa'', is made from goat intestine and other offcuts.
