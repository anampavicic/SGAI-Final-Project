'''Taiz''' ({{langx|ar|تَعِزّ|Taʿizz}}) is a [[governorates of Yemen|governorate]] of [[Yemen]]. The governorate's capital [[Taiz]], the third-largest city in Yemen, is among the most important commercial centres in the country, owing to its proximity to rich farmland and the important [[Red Sea]] port of Mocha. It also has an [[international airport]], [[Taiz International Airport]], with numerous services within Yemen and to neighbouring countries.

==Geography==
For such a small area, Taiz Governorate has an extraordinarily diverse geography. The western half of the governorate is part of the [[Tihamah]] [[coastal plain]] and has an exceedingly [[Heat|hot]], [[Humidity|humid]] and [[arid]] [[climate]]. The eastern half, however, is very [[mountain]]ous, with the major peak being 3,070-metre-high [[Jabal Sabir]], near Taiz city. These mountains trap the moisture created by an upper-level wind reversal between April and October, so that in the eastern half of the governorate annual [[rainfall]] increases from 200 millimetres (8 inches) in the foothills to probably more than 1,000 millimetres (40 inches) near Jebel Saber. Temperatures in the highlands remain high during the daytime, but at the highest elevations they can fall dramatically to -5&nbsp;°C (23&nbsp;°F) overnight.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}
