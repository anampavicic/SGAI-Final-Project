'''Hub''' ({{langx|ur|{{Nastaliq|حب}}}}) is a city and capital of the [[Hub District]]<ref>{{Cite news|date=2022-02-03|title=Lasbela bifurcated, Hub made new district|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1673011|access-date=2023-05-10|newspaper=Dawn (newspaper)|language=en}}</ref> in [[Pakistan]]'s [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] province. It is the [[List of cities in Pakistan by population|49th largest city of Pakistan]] by population, according to the 2023 census, and is also [[List of cities in Balochistan, Pakistan by population|Balochistan's fourth-largest city]]. Hub is an industrial city and its original name was Hub Chowki because once there was a police and customs check post (which is known as chowki in [[Urdu]]), named Nakahi. After the development of factories and many other industries, the town was renamed as Hub. It is one of the largest industrial centres of Balochistan, and, because of its proximity to [[Karachi]], is becoming a [[commuter town]] of the Karachi metropolitan area.

== History ==
The [[Principality of Kalmat|Kalmati Malik Principality]] of Hub-Malir Following the downfall of the Sultanate of Makran (mid 12th-early 14th century, A.D.)" the succeeding Baloch state of Kalmat (14th to mid-16th century) flourished in the coastal region extending from Pasni southward most probably as far as the Hub river.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gOxtAAAAMAAJ&q=Kalmat+|title=Pakistan Journal of History and Culture (pages 5, 14, 15)|date=1993|publisher=National Institute of Historical and Cultural Research via Google Books website|language=en}}</ref>

==Demographics==
The majority of the population is [[Muslims|Muslim]], while there are small [[Hindus|Hindu]] and [[Christians|Christian]] minorities. Increased commercialization in this area has led to many social, political and hygienic problems. The worsening state of roads and streets in the area has made everyday life difficult. Roads are too busy as the area serves as a hub between [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] and [[Karachi]], that is one of the main reasons behind the lack of development in this area.

==Economy==
Hub is economically one of the largest industrial cities in [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]]. Hub is emerging as a commercial centre due to its proximity to [[Karachi]]. The [[Bazaar]]s and [[Marketplace|markets]] are full with varieties of goods as well.
