Nouvelle-Aquitaine has an area of {{convert|84035.7|km2|abbr=on}} – more than {{frac|1|7}} of [[Metropolitan France]] – and has a population of 6,033,952 {{as of|2020|lc=yes}}.<ref name="Population">{{cite web|url=https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/1405599?geo=REG-75|title=Comparateur de territoire: Région de la Nouvelle-Aquitaine (75)|work=[[Insee]]|access-date=8 September 2020}}</ref> The new region was established on 1 January 2016, following the [[2015 French regional elections|regional elections in December 2015]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2014/12/17/la-carte-a-13-regions-definitivement-adoptee_4542278_823448.html|title=La carte à 13 régions définitivement adoptée|date=17 December 2014|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|publisher=[[Le Monde]]|language=fr|access-date=13 January 2015}}</ref>

It is the largest region in France by area (including [[Overseas departments and regions of France|overseas regions]] such as [[French Guiana]]), with a territory slightly larger than that of [[Austria]]. Its [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] and largest city, [[Bordeaux]], together with its suburbs and satellite cities, forms the seventh-largest metropolitan area of France, with 850,000 inhabitants. The region has 25 major urban areas, among which the most important after Bordeaux are [[Bayonne]] (288,000 inhabitants), [[Limoges]] (283,000), [[Poitiers]] (255,000), [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]] (241,000) and [[La Rochelle]] (206,000), as well as eleven major clusters.

New Aquitaine has five universities ([[University of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], [[University of La Rochelle|La Rochelle]], [[University of Limoges|Limoges]], [[University of Poitiers|Poitiers]] and [[University of Pau and Pays de l'Adour|Pau]]) and several [[Grandes écoles|Grandes Écoles]]. It has three of the four historic resorts on the French Atlantic coast: [[Arcachon]], [[Biarritz]] and [[Royan]], as well as several ski resorts (most notably [[Gourette]]).

Its economy is based on [[agriculture]] and [[viticulture]] ([[Bordeaux wine|vineyards of Bordeaux]] and [[Cognac]]), [[tourism]], a powerful [[aerospace industry]], [[digital economy]] and design, parachemical and pharmaceutical industries, [[financial sector]] ([[Niort]]) and industrial ceramics ([[Limoges]]). The new region includes major parts of [[Southern France]] ("''Midi de la France''"), marked by [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Poitevin dialect|Poitevin]] and [[Saintongeais dialect|Saintongeais]] cultures. Historically, it is the "indirect successor" to [[Duchy of Aquitaine|medieval Aquitaine]]; it extends over a large part of the former Duchy of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]].

The region's [[Working title|interim name]] ''Aquitaine-Limousin-Poitou-Charentes'' was a hyphenated placename, known as ALPC, created by hyphenating the merged regions' names – ''[[Aquitaine]]'',  ''[[Limousin]]'' and ''[[Poitou-Charentes]]'' – in alphabetical order.<ref name="reform law">{{cite French law|number or usual name=n° 2015-29|date in French=16 janvier 2015|full name=relative à la délimitation des régions, aux élections régionales et départementales et modifiant le calendrier électoral|language=fr|lower case=|URL=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=9FECBA9D9314D1D2C093CF793C886ED5.tpdila21v_1?idSectionTA=JORFSCTA000030109623&cidTexte=JORFTEXT000030109622&dateTexte=29990101}}</ref>

== Geography ==
At 84,061 square kilometres, Nouvelle-Aquitaine is larger than [[French Guiana]], which makes it the largest region of [[Metropolitan France|metropolitan]] and [[overseas France]].

Nouvelle-Aquitaine is delimited by four other French regions ([[Pays de la Loire]] to the north-west, [[Centre-Val de Loire]] to the northeast, [[Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes]] to the east, and [[Occitania (administrative region)|Occitania]] to the south-east), three autonomous communities in [[Spain]] to the south (from east to west, [[Aragon]], [[Navarre]], and [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]), and the North [[Atlantic Ocean]] (the eastern part of [[Bay of Biscay]], ''Golfe de Gascogne'' in French) to the west.

=== Departments ===
Nouvelle-Aquitaine comprises twelve [[Departments of France|departments]]: [[Charente]], [[Charente-Maritime]], [[Corrèze]], [[Creuse]], [[Dordogne]], [[Gironde]], [[Landes (department)|Landes]], [[Lot-et-Garonne]], [[Pyrénées-Atlantiques]], [[Deux-Sèvres]], [[Vienne (department)|Vienne]] and [[Haute-Vienne]].

=== Urban centers ===

Its largest city and only metropolis is [[Bordeaux]], in the heart of an urban agglomeration of over one million inhabitants. Taking into consideration the urban area, the new region is home to six of the fifty largest metropolitan areas of French territory (population 2011):

* [[Bordeaux]] (1,140,668 inhabitants)
* [[Bayonne]] (283,571)
* [[Limoges]] (282,876)
* [[Poitiers]] (254 051)
* [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]] (240,898)
* [[La Rochelle]] (205,822).

In addition, the region has a network of medium-sized towns scattered throughout its territory, including:

* [[Angoulême]] (108,304)
* [[Agen]] (79,764)
* [[Brive-la-Gaillarde]] (75,925)
* [[Niort]] (71,046)
* [[Périgueux]] (66,423)
* [[Bergerac, Dordogne|Bergerac]] (64,427)
* [[Villeneuve-sur-Lot]] (49,354)
* [[Arrondissement of Dax|Dax]] (48,820)
* [[Mont-de-Marsan]] (40,269)

=== Geographical features ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2023}}
The region covers a large part of the [[Aquitaine Basin]] and a small portion of the [[Paris Basin]] (the border between the two being located at the "[[Seuil du Poitou]]") and the Limousin plate (part of the Massif Central) and the western part of the [[Pyrenees]]. It is part of five watersheds facing the Atlantic Ocean: [[Loire]], [[Charente (river)|Charente]], [[Garonne]] and [[Dordogne (river)|Dordogne]] (and their extension, the [[Gironde estuary]]) and [[Adour]], giving rivers bordering land dedicated mostly to viticulture and to agriculture.

[[File:Dune du Pyla 2014 3.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Dune of Pilat]] is the tallest dune in Europe.]]
Nouvelle-Aquitaine features a large open coastline along the [[Atlantic Ocean]], extending from the National Nature Reserve of Aiguillon Bay and the estuary of the [[Sèvre Niortaise|Sèvre]] (near [[Charron, Charente-Maritime|Charron]]) to [[Bidasoa]] (south of [[Hendaye]]). This coastline includes the islands of the Charentais Archipelago ([[Île de Ré|Ré]], [[Oléron]], [[Île-d'Aix|Aix]], and [[Île Madame|Madame]]) and the inlet of Arcachon. The region is notable for its oyster farming (Marennes-Oléron and the Bassin d’Arcachon), mussel farming (Baie de l’Aiguillon), and tourism. Prominent resorts in the area include [[Arcachon]] (Côte d’Argent), [[Biarritz]] (Côte Basque), and [[Royan]] (Côte de Beauté).

From the {{Interlanguage link|Arvert Peninsula|fr|3=Presqu'île d'Arvert}} to the coast of [[Labourd]], the coastline is predominantly straight and characterized by high dunes, including [[Dune du Pilat]], large lakes (such as [[Lac d'Hourtin-Carcans]], [[Étang de Lacanau]], [[Étang de Cazaux et de Sanguinet]], and [[Lac de Biscarrosse et de Parentis]]), and wetlands (including the Réserve Naturelle Nationale des Dunes et Marais d'Hourtin), all situated above vast pine forests planted in the 19th century. The [[Landes forest]], the most extensive in the region, covers nearly one million hectares (approximately 950,000 hectares of maritime pines), making it the largest artificial forest in Western Europe.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-06-06 |title=Landes de Gascogne, plus grande forêt artificielle d'Europe occidentale |url=https://www.retronews.fr/environnement/long-format/2023/06/06/sequence-pedagogique-landes-gascogne-foret-artificielle |access-date=2024-06-21 |website=RetroNews - Le site de presse de la BnF |language=fr}}</ref> This forest forms a vast triangle extending from the [[Pointe de Grave]], north of [[Soulac-sur-Mer]], to [[Soorts-Hossegor|Hossegor]] in the south and [[Nérac]] in the east, replacing the sandy and marshy [[moorland]] that characterized the region for centuries. The Landes forest is partially included in the [[Landes de Gascogne Regional Natural Park]], which begins south of Bordeaux.

Further north, adjacent to the Landes forest, the [[forest of la Coubre]] on the right bank of the [[Gironde estuary]] shares similar characteristics, covering nearly 8,000 hectares. Other significant forests in the region include the [[Irati Forest]] in the [[French Basque Country|Basque Country]], which spans over 17,000 hectares, and the Forest of the Double, located at the borders of Charente, Charente-Maritime, and Dordogne, which covers about 50,000 hectares and is dotted with nearly 500 lakes. Additionally, near Poitiers, the {{Interlanguage link|Moulière forest|fr|3=Forêt de Moulière}} extends over nearly 6,800 hectares, and to the east, near Guéret, the {{Interlanguage link|Chabrières forest|fr|3=Forêt de Chabrières}} encompasses 2,000 hectares.

[[File:Ossau face est01.jpg|thumb|[[Pic du Midi d'Ossau]]]]
The extreme southern region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine is characterized by the presence of the [[Pyrenees]]. The western part, known as the mountains of Labourd, consists mostly of high green hills. Further east, the highest point in the French Basque Country is [[Pic d'Orhy]], which reaches 2,017 meters. The Pau region is notable for its more rugged, mineral landscapes, featuring high peaks often exceeding 2,000 meters. The highest point in the region, {{Interlanguage link|Pic Palas|simple}}, stands at 2,974 meters. Other significant Pyrenean peaks in the region include [[Pic du Midi d'Ossau]] (2,884 m), {{Interlanguage link|Pic d'Arriel|fr}} (2,824 m), [[Pic de Ger]] (2,613 m) near the winter resort [[Gourette]], [[Pic d'Anie]] (2,504 m), {{Interlanguage link|Latte de Bazen|fr}} (2,472 m), {{Interlanguage link|Pic d'Ansabère|fr|3=Pic d'Ansabère}} (2,377 m), {{Interlanguage link|Pic de l'Arraille|fr}} (2,147 m), and {{Interlanguage link|Pic d'Arlas|fr|3=Pic d'Arlas}} (2,044 m).

This hilly region is traversed by numerous mountain streams, known as [[Gave (placename element)|gaves]]. Notable gaves in the area include the [[Gave de Pau]], the {{Interlanguage link|Gave de Bious|fr}}, the [[Gave d'Ossau]], and the [[Gaves réunis]] on the border of Landes and Pyrénées-Atlantiques. The [[Ossau Valley]], one of the three valleys of [[Béarn]], extends from the suburbs of Pau to [[Col du Pourtalet]] at the [[France–Spain border|Spanish border]]. The region's glacial lakes, along with their diverse fauna and flora, contribute to its inclusion in the [[Pyrénées National Park]].

Belonging to the [[Massif Central]], [[Limousin]] features a varied landscape with high plateaus and some eroded peaks that dominate green valleys and forests of oak and chestnut trees. The Limousin plateau, intersected by the valleys of the [[Vienne (river)|Vienne]] (which flows through its capital, [[Limoges]]), [[Isle (river)|Isle]], [[Vézère]], and the picturesque [[Corrèze (river)|Corrèze]] with its deep reliefs, seldom exceeds 500 meters in elevation. It forms the watershed between the [[Loire]] basin to the north (including the sources of the [[Briance]], {{Interlanguage link|Aixette|fr}}, {{Interlanguage link|Grêne|fr}}, and [[Gorre]]), the Dordogne basin to the south (including the sources of the [[Dronne]], Isle, and [[Auvézère]]), and the maritime watershed of the Charente to the west.

[[File:Sédières 1 110.jpg|thumb|left|Typical landscape in [[Corrèze]]]]
The mountains of Limousin, which include a series of small mountains (Mont Fayat, Monedières Hills, Mont de Châlus) peak at Mont Bessou (976 m), in Corrèze. Further north, the mountains of Marche, which are divided into mountains of Monts de Guéret, mont d'Ambazac and Monts de Blond, are more like high wooded hills dotted with pastures, as real peaks. They culminate in Signal de Sauvagnac (701 m), in Haute-Vienne. Southwest of Limousin and Périgord northwest since 1998 are integrated into the [[Parc naturel régional Périgord Limousin]].

The northern part of the region, which corresponds to the Haut-Poitou history, is organised around a tray agricultural and viticultural (vineyard of Haut-Poitou) irrigated by the [[Vienne (river)|Vienne]], [[Clain]] or the [[Gartempe]], which form so little valleys, often lined with oak forests. Further south, the Niortais this open landscapes (openfields) in grain-dominant, but also rich wetland areas such as the [[Marais Poitevin]], a legacy of an old marine gulf filled with alluvium, which is divided into wet marshes (we speak more readily of "Green Venice") and marshes dried up, converted into mixed farming. [[Niort]], on the [[Sèvre Niortaise]], the main town of the Haut-Poitou outside [[Poitiers]], is like a door of this "Green Venice" much of which belongs to the [[Marais Poitevin|parc naturel régional du Marais poitevin]], established in 1979, classified "Grand site de France".

Further south lie the Charentes, which correspond to the former provinces of [[Aunis]], [[Angoumois]] and [[County of Saintonge|Saintonge]]. Aunis is not unlike the landscape of Niortais, with large marshes that extend from either side of [[La Rochelle]] and [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] (Baie d'Yves, marais de Rochefort, Broue and [[Brouage]]) but also the islands of [[Île de Ré|Ré]] and [[Île d'Aix|Aix]], with varied landscapes where pine forests mingle, sandy beaches or the curious lagoon of Fier d'Ars, the sands in constant motion, which houses a bird sanctuary. The interior of the territory is marked by the presence of a rich plain cereal evoking the [[Beauce, France|Beauce]] by its open relief on the horizon. At the center of this space, the city of [[Surgères]] remained a pastureland where dairy farming has retained its importance: the small city is thus a production centers butter, Beurre de Charentes-Poitou.

[[File:Le Vanneau-Passerelle.jpg|thumb|Between [[Poitou]] and [[Charente-Maritime]], the [[Marais Poitevin]]]]
The [[Angoumois]] forms a transitional space between the coastal plains of Aunis, large "champagne" of Saintonge and Limousin plateau. Dotted with small hills, he seems to live to the rhythm of the Charente, real artery watering its major cities, [[Angoulême]], [[Cognac, France|Cognac]] and [[Jarnac]]. Great wine region, internationally renowned alcohol is produced there, [[cognac]], and a water spirits called [[Pineau des Charentes]]. The western quarter of Charentes consists of Saintonge, organised territory around the towns of [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]], the first capital of Aquitaine in Roman times, and [[Royan]].

In continuation of the Angoumois, the Dordogne approximately corresponds to the former province of [[Périgord]]. Taking its name from the river of the same name, which flows [[Bergerac, Dordogne|Bergerac]] but not its prefecture, [[Périgueux]] (the edge of the [[Isle (river)|Isle]]), the area with varied landscapes has a large afforestation rate (45%) making it the third most wooded department France. The great forests of oak and chestnut trees of green Périgord, organised around [[Nontron]], meet the great grain fields of the White Périgord, nicknamed "the breadbasket of the Périgord", the oak, walnut and black Périgord truffle, around [[Sarlat-la-Caneda]] and vineyards of Bergerac or purple Périgord, which produces Bergerac, monbazillac or pécharmant.

[[File:Roselière de Pauillac et carrelets sur l'estuaire de la Gironde, France.jpg|thumb|The [[Gironde estuary]] is the largest estuary in Western Europe.]]
The [[Gironde estuary]], which acts as a link between [[County of Saintonge|Saintonge]], {{Interlanguage link|Blayais|oc|3=Blaiés}}, [[Médoc]] and western [[Guyenne]], is in itself a world apart. Wild largest estuary in Europe, being classified in the marine park with the "Pertuis charentais", it is lined with large marshes ("Petite Camargue" and hillsides which produces most of the great Bordeaux wines from the Côtes-de-Bordeaux and Côtes-de-Bourg on the right bank to the great wines of the left bank Médoc (Pauillac, Margaux, Saint-Estèphe, Saint-Julien. The vineyards of Bordeaux, with international reputation, has done for centuries the reputation of the region. His productions are exported worldwide.

Farther south lies the vast plain Landes (south of Gironde and Landes), which begins near Bordeaux and go to the Pyrénées. Largely occupied by the [[Landes forest]], it is also a major agricultural area (maize farming) and hosts a spa of international reputation, Dax, also the capital of [[Chalosse]], important breeding ground.

[[File:Bassin d'Arcachon - Cabanes tchanquées.jpg|thumb|"Cabanes tchanquées" in [[Arcachon Bay]]]]
The coastline subject to severe erosion, remained very wild. Some resorts have been built in the dunes from [[Soulac-sur-Mer]] in the north of the Gironde, via [[Lacanau]], [[Hourtin]], [[Biscarrosse]], [[Mimizan]] and [[Capbreton]], without forgetting those bordering the Bay of Arcachon: [[Arcachon]], [[Andernos-les-Bains]], [[Lège-Cap-Ferret]], {{Interlanguage link|Pyla-sur-Mer|es}}. This vast lagoon, wide open ocean, houses since 2014 the marine natural park of Arcachon basin.

Eastern Guyenne corresponds in part to the department of [[Lot-et-Garonne]]. Rich agricultural and farming area watered by both the [[Lot (river)|Lot]] and the [[Garonne]], it is famous for its "[[prune]]aux", who took the name of its capital, [[Agen]] (nearly 8000 hectares of land are dedicated to Ente plum orchards) while [[Marmande]] is famous for its tomatoes. The mild climate explains that also cultivated [[tobacco]], as well as strawberries ("gariguettes") and vines, used to produce the Côtes du marmandais the buzet or Côte de Brulhois, that relate to the broad vineyard of the Southwest. But the real glory of this land is [[Armagnac (brandy)|Armagnac]], a famous brandy, exported around the world. Its vineyards cover some of the departments of Lot-et-Garonne, Landes but also the [[Gers]] (in the neighbouring region of [[Occitania (administrative region)|Occitania]]). It also produces the [[floc de Gascogne]], with delicate floral accents.

The extreme south of the region consists of two territories in strong identity, the [[French Basque Country|Basque Country]] (Northern Basque Country or "Iparralde") and [[Béarn]]. The first, which is organised around [[Bayonne]], [[Biarritz]], [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]] (Labourd) [[Mauléon-Licharre]] (Soule) and [[Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port]] (Lower Navarre) has its warm and humid climate its green side, the Atlantic rains from butter against the Pyrenean barrier. The coast, with both high-end and family resorts, is a popular holiday resort. The interior is more rural and retains a strong agricultural tradition, and is a solid wine region, symbolised by the vineyard Irouléguy but also by traditional liquors such as [[Izarra (liqueur)|izarra]] and [[patxaran]], eau-de-vie characteristic of [[Navarre]] .

Anchored in the heart of the Pyrenees, the Béarn opposes its Gascon traditions. It has a succession of gently accented hills and valleys (that of Pau river, where the capital is located, [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], and others named [[Orthez]] and [[Navarrenx]], being the most populated), it comprises the [[Aspe Valley|Aspe]], the {{Interlanguage link|Barétous Valley|fr|3=Vallée de Barétous|lt=Barétous}} and [[Ossau Valley|Ossau]] valleys along with the [[Col du Soulor]]. Agriculture will always be prominent, as viticulture (jurançon, Madiran) even if the aeronautical and petrochemical sectors are also represented. The main ski resorts in the area, such as [[Artouste]], [[Gourette]], {{Interlanguage link|Issarbe|fr}}, {{Interlanguage link|La Pierre Saint-Martin|fr}} and {{Interlanguage link|Le Somport|fr}} are concentrated in the Béarn area.

== Climate ==
The climate of Nouvelle-Aquitaine is classified as an [[oceanic climate]] under the [[Köppen climate classification]] scheme.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://en.climate-data.org/europe/france/aquitaine-291/ | title=Climate Aquitaine: Temperature, climate graph, Climate table for Aquitaine }}</ref> The climates within the region can be sub-classified as follows:<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nouvelle-aquitaine-tourisme.com/en/practical-info/climate-and-geography | title=Visit Nouvelle-Aquitaine - Climate and Geography }}</ref>
*The Aquitaine oceanic climate, which includes a majority of the region from [[Charentes]] to [[Landes (department)|Landes]]
*The Paris oceanic climate, in [[Poitou]]
*The Limousin oceanic climate, in [[Limousin]]
*The Basque microclimate, in the [[French Basque Country|Basque Country]]
*The [[Alpine climate|Pyrenean climate]], which varies with altitude

[[File:Une Vague - A wave.jpg|thumb|Wave at [[Saint-Clément-des-Baleines]], on the [[Île de Ré]] ([[Charente-Maritime]]).]]

In the north of the region, the Paris oceanic climate is marked by moderate rainfall, warm summers and cool winters, but moderately so. The [[Seuil du Poitou]] acts as a relative climatic barrier and regions further south belong to the Aquitaine oceanic climate area. Coastal areas are wetter overall, with moderate rainfall spread throughout the year, except for the summer months, where droughts are not uncommon. Summer, which is relatively warm, is tempered by sea breezes, and winters are cool-mild. Frosts and snow are unusual. Sunshine is quite high, with around 2,000 to 2,200 hours per year, which is comparable to some Mediterranean regions ([[Perpignan]]). Summer precipitation often take the form of thunderstorms, possibly violent, while winter is sometimes marked by storms, some of which have marked the area with their exceptional: [[Cyclone Lothar and Martin|Martin]] in 1999 (record of 198&nbsp;km / h in [[Saint-Denis-d'Oléron]]), [[Cyclone Klaus|Klaus]] in 2009 (172&nbsp;km / h to [[Biscarrosse]]) and [[Cyclone Xynthia|Xynthia]] in 2010 (160&nbsp;km / h on the [[Île de Ré]]).

The climate in [[Angoumois]] and [[Limousin]] is wetter and cooler, remains temperate with warm spring and has relatively warm summers, with variations due to altitude. The annual sunshine averages at 1850 hours. The climate of the [[French Basque Country|Basque country]] and southern [[Landes (department)|Landes]] is marked by its warm summers, mild winters but especially by its high rainfall, with Atlantic depressions that hit the Pyrenean foothills. This Microclimate explains the presence of lush vegetation and the green aspect of the region. Fogs are not rare, but usually dissipate very quickly.

As for the Pyrenean climate, suboceanic trend [[Béarn]], it is subject to frequent "cap effect" when the north-west of disturbances abut against the Pyrenean mountains. Valley bottoms, true "funnels clouds" are particularly watered. The winter snow is important above 1200 meters. Pau valley has a microclimate, however, marked by strong sunlight (about 1900 hours a year) but high rainfall (1100&nbsp;mm per year) and a near absence of frost in winter. Rainfall is usually brief there, but regular, and spread throughout the year.

== Transport ==

Nouvelle-Aquitaine is a region of transit between the Paris Basin (including Île-de-France) and the Iberian Peninsula, but also between the Rhône Valley and the Atlantic and Mediterranean regions (noon Toulouse). This situation implies several years developing roads and major highways, especially in the context of the road Estuaries, but also the high-speed Paris-Bordeaux-Toulouse-Spain, which should help significantly shorten rail journeys.

=== Roads and highways ===
Many roads and highways in the region radiate from [[Bordeaux]] and just attach to its peripheral belt (Bordeaux ring road or [[A630 autoroute|A630]]). The main lines used for reinforcing roads and highways are in addition some terminal bonds designed to streamline access to two major resorts in the area, [[Arcachon]] (via Highway A660) and [[Royan]] (by via the N150, partly making 2X2 routes).

[[File:ringbordeaux.jpg|thumb|The ring road of [[Bordeaux]] supports a particularly heavy traffic.]]

The [[A10 autoroute]] (the "Aquitaine") is the major artery between Bordeaux and [[Paris]], commissioned in 1981. It is part of the network of "autoroutes du Sud de la France" and provides access to several cities: [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]], [[Niort]] or [[Poitiers]]. From Saintes, highway [[A837 autoroute|A837]] allows drivers to reach the town of [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]]. Further north, in Niort, an interchange provides access to the [[A83 autoroute|A83]] motorway, the [[Vendée]] and [[Nantes]] (Pays de la Loire). The N10 is the main road of the [[Charente]] and an important road for connecting between Bordeaux and Poitiers including [[Angoulême]].

Connecting the east of Bordeaux ([[Libourne]]) to [[Lyon|Greater Lyon]], the [[A89 autoroute|A89]] motorway (called "La transversale") irrigates the eastern part of the region, facilitating travel between the cities of Bordeaux and [[Périgueux]], [[Brive-la-Gaillarde]], [[Tulle]] and [[Ussel, Lot|Ussel]]. A little further south, the D936, which roughly follows the course of the Dordogne, is grafted on the Bordeaux ring road via an interchange at the municipalities of [[Cenon]] and [[Floirac, Gironde|Floirac]]. It gives access to the towns of [[Branne, Gironde|Branne]], [[Castillon-la-Bataille]] and [[Sainte-Foy-la-Grande]] (Gironde) and [[Bergerac, Dordogne|Bergerac]] (Dordogne).

Southwest of Bordeaux, the [[A63 autoroute|A63]] is a major focus of the regional motorway network. Forming a large artery almost straight through the vast expanses of flat [[Landes de Gascogne]], it crosses the south of Gironde and Landes (passes near [[Dax, Landes|Dax]] but avoids the prefecture, Mont-de-Marsan) before joining [[Bayonne]] and the Basque Country, to [[Irun]], on the Spanish border, the main border crossing. The other border crossings, less frequented but less direct, are the Somport tunnel and Col du Pourtalet.

The Basque Country and Béarn are also served by a road parallel to the Pyrenees, which facilitates access to Toulouse and the Mediterranean regions: the [[A64 autoroute|A64]], called "La Pyrénéenne". It starts from [[Briscous]] (in the outskirts of Bayonne), continues to [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]] before reaching [[Tarbes]] in the neighbouring region of [[Occitania (administrative region)|Occitania]]) and the Toulouse ring road.

The eastern region is well served by the [[A20 autoroute|A20]] north–south axis between Paris and Toulouse and opens up Limousin. It thus goes through [[La Souterraine]], [[Limoges]] and [[Brive-la-Gaillarde]]. Another important way, the European route E603 connects [[Limoges]] to [[Angoulême]] and [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]]. It represents one of the key elements of the road Central Europe Atlantic important channel of communication between the Rhône Valley and the Atlantic coast, which is divided into multiple plots at Angoulême and Saintes (Bordeaux, Royan and La Rochelle).

=== Rail network ===
The regional rail network is organised around the main towns: [[Bordeaux]], [[Limoges]], [[Poitiers]], [[La Rochelle]] and [[Bayonne]]. The main line is the one between [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] via Poitiers, Bordeaux and [[Hendaye]]; then comes the line [[Lille]]-[[Brive-la-Gaillarde]], which serves [[Limoges]], both served by [[TGV]] trains. Other lines are served mostly by the [[Transport express régional|TER]] network of [[TER Nouvelle-Aquitaine]].

[[File:Bordeaux Gare StJean R03.jpg|thumb|With 10 million passengers a year, the [[Gare de Bordeaux-Saint-Jean|Bordeaux-Saint-Jean]] station is the largest station in the region.]]

The largest station in the region is [[Gare de Bordeaux-Saint-Jean|Bordeaux-Saint-Jean]], which accommodates 10 million passengers per year; then comes [[Limoges-Bénédictins station]] and its 2.5 million passengers. Poitiers has two stations: [[Poitiers station]] and [[Futuroscope station]] which serves the technology park [[Futuroscope]]. [[Angoulême station]] sees around 1.45 million passengers per year; [[Agen station]] links the [[Occitania (administrative region)|Occitania]] region; [[Pau station]], [[Dax station]].

The implementation of the [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]], which is part of a priority program initiated by the state.

Another important project for the region, the [[LGV Bordeaux–Spain]] extends of the South Europe Atlantic TGV line to connect with the [[Basque Y]] (high-speed line linking the Spanish cities of [[Bilbao]], [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]], [[San Sebastián|San Sebastian]] and [[Irun]]). It is part of the great South West Rail project and should facilitate regional connections between Bordeaux, Mont-de-Marsan, Dax, Bayonne, long-distance connections between the south of the region and Île-de-France, as well as international links to [[Spain]] (including Madrid).

The LGV Bar project between Poitiers and Limoges is part of this context, and should significantly shorten travel between the two cities (from just over an hour and a half to 45 minutes), facilitate interregional connections and access to Île-de-France. This project is one of the links of "Transline project" (Transversal Auvergne Atlantic Alpes), still under study.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

=== Airports ===

The region benefits from the presence of several airport infrastructure. The main airport is [[Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport|Bordeaux-Merignac]], world class, which hosts nearly four and a half million passengers per year and offers flights to many destinations; It is the seventh metropolitan France Airport (fifth if we except the Paris airports).

[[File:Biarritz Aéroport (1).jpg|thumb|The terminal of the Biarritz-Anglet-Bayonne Airport, which has the second greatest attendance in the region.]]

The second airport is [[Biarritz – Anglet – Bayonne Airport|Biarritz-Anglet-Bayonne]], third is [[Pau Pyrénées Airport]], then [[Limoges – Bellegarde Airport|Limoges-Bellegarde]],  and [[Bergerac Dordogne Périgord Airport]].

The [[La Rochelle – Île de Ré Airport|airport of La Rochelle - Île de Ré]] offers flights to several French and European cities. Smaller, airports [[Poitiers–Biard Airport|Poitiers-Biard]], [[Brive–Souillac Airport|Brive Dordogne]], [[Agen La Garenne Airport|Agen-La Garenne]] and [[Périgueux Bassillac Airport|Périgueux-Bassillac]] offer mainly domestic flights. Airports [[Angoulême – Cognac International Airport|Angoulême-Cognac]] and [[Rochefort – Charente-Maritime Airport|Rochefort-Charente-Maritime]] are only turned to business flights in the absence of regular commercial lines.

=== Harbours ===

Cruise ships mostly dock in the ports of La Rochelle (terminal [[La Pallice]]), Verdon-sur-Mer (shuttles for [[Royan]]), [[Pauillac]], [[Bordeaux]] and [[Bayonne]].

[[File:Port de Royan de Nuit (2).jpg|thumb|[[Royan]] harbour by night.]]

Many marinas are open to smaller boats. The main ones are those of [[La Rochelle]] (4800 rings), [[Arcachon]] (2600 rings), [[Port-Médoc]] (1200 rings), [[Royan]] (1000 rings), of [[Capbreton]] (950 rings), [[Hendaye]] (800 rings), [[Saint-Denis-d'Oléron]] (750 rings) and [[Anglet]]-[[Biarritz]] (425 rings).

River transport is active on several rivers in the region: [[Charente (river)|Charente]] (mainly between [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] and [[Angoulême]]), [[Gironde estuary]], [[Garonne]], [[Dordogne (river)|Dordogne]], [[Lot (river)|Lot]], [[Baise]] and [[Adour]].

Landmark river tourism, the Canal de Garonne is an extension of the [[Canal du Midi]] (which together form the "Canal des Deux-Mers" between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean). It passes including [[Agen]] (Agen aqueduct) and continues until [[Castets-en-Dorthe]] (Gironde).

The entire watershed of the Dordogne is classified as a biosphere reserve by UNESCO since 11 July 2012 with the co-ordination structure Institution of regional public Dordogne basin. The basin of the Dordogne is one of the few places in France where the presence of eight migratory fish species proved with Atlantic salmon, sea trout, river lamprey, sea lamprey, Allis shad, shad feigned, eel, and sturgeon in Europe. Other species associated with water, such as the common otter and the European mink, or the penny whistle swimming, are also present.

Two water agencies (Adour-Garonne and Loire-Bretagne) are involved in water management in the region.

== Economy ==
The [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 177.0 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 7.5% of French economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 26,500 euros or 88% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 101% of the EU average.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|website=Eurostat}}</ref>

The economy of the region is based on several pillars: diversified [[agriculture]], a set of famous vineyards ([[Bordeaux wine]], brandies of [[Cognac]] and [[Armagnac (brandy)|Armagnac]]), but also a decisive role in the industry sectors [[aerospace]], defence, [[biotechnology]], [[chemistry]] and more generally for [[scientific research]], relying on a network of universities and [[Grandes Ecoles]].

[[File:Bordeaux Mériadeck R02.jpg|thumb|The business district of [[Mériadeck]] at [[Bordeaux]], remained on a human scale.]]

Nouvelle-Aquitaine can also count on a large image and digital sector ("Campus de l'Image" of [[Angoulême]], future "Cité Numérique" of [[Bègles]]), a dense network of small and medium enterprises, the presence in its territory of large [[agribusiness]] as well as a port network including three major commercial ports being balanced due to their geographical position ([[La Pallice|Grand Port maritime de La Rochelle]] in the north, [[Port of Bordeaux|Grand Port maritime de Bordeaux]] and [[port of Bayonne]] in the south).

=== Agricultural and wine sectors ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2023}}
An important rural Region, Nouvelle-Aquitaine has a varied agriculture. Cattle breeding (regional races: [[Limousin (cattle)|Limousin]], Bordelais, [[Parthenais]], [[Blonde d'Aquitaine]], Gasconne, [[Bazadais]] and Béarnais) is predominant in the Bressuirais and Confolentais grove and in the Aunisienne plain, on the high Limousin plateau, in the Bazadaises and Chalossiennes Hills and is used both in the production of meat to milk production. There are also two other bovine regional breeds do not belong to the list of official French breeds (Marinelandaise and Betizu) endangered. The area has many quality labels ("Veau fermier élevé sous la mère", Limousin beef ...).

[[File:Blonde Aquitaine.jpg|thumb|[[Blonde d'Aquitaine]] in the [[Pyrenees]].]]

Goats (regional breeds: Poitevine, Pyrenees and Massif Central) are mainly concentrated in the north of the region (Charente, Charente-Maritime, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne) and are used for cheese production ([[chabichou]], [[mothais sur feuille]], jonchée). Some departments complement this area (Corrèze and Dordogne with a part of the production of [[Rocamadour cheese|Rocamadour]] [[Appellation d'origine contrôlée|AOC]]). Sheep farming (regional races: Basque-béarnaise, Landes, limousine, manech black head, red head and Xaxi Ardia) is well represented in the Limousin (Limousin lamb) the Charentes (lamb Poitou-Charentes), the Médoc (Pauillac lamb) and the Basque and Bearn Pyrenees.

Pig farming, which represents a significant part of the agri-food sector is distributed throughout the region (regional races: black ass Limousin, Gascon pork pie black Basque) and is guaranteed by the label "porc du Sud-Ouest ". The pigs in the region are used to produce many meat products, starting with the famous Bayonne ham. Many farms have also specialised in poultry production including yellow chicken Saint-Sever and poultry of Sèvres val (regional races [[Barbezieux (chicken)|Barbezieux]], Limousin, Gascony, Landes and Marans) and fat waterfowl (mule ducks and geese), primarily designed for the production of foie gras and confit. Nouvelle-Aquitaine is the first European region for foie gras (more than half the French production). The label "Canard à foie gras du Sud-Ouest" occupies a large part of the region.

The region is the birthplace of many other breeds (regional donkey breeds: the Pyrenees and Poitou, regional equine: Poitevin mule, Landais and Pottock).

The area is also an important oyster production center, with oysters " de Claires" from [[Marennes, Charente-Maritime|Marennes]]-[[Île d'Oléron|Oléron]] (in the estuary of the [[Seudre]]) and those of [[Arcachon]] and [[Cap Ferret]] and a stronghold of the mussel with mussels from Aiguillon Bay (near [[La Rochelle]]) and mussel Boyardville and [[Port-des-Barques]].

[[File:Remy Martin XO - Louis XIII - Hennessy Paradis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cognac]], one of two regional famous brandies with [[Armagnac (brandy)|Armagnac]].]]

[[Viticulture]] is a key sector of the local economy, the region with the presence of some of the most prestigious French vineyards: vineyards of Bordeaux, Bergerac, Cognac (production of [[Cognac]] and [[Pineau des Charentes]]) and partially, Armagnac (production of [[Armagnac (brandy)|Armagnac]] and [[Floc de Gascogne]]), Southwest vineyards in the valleys of the Garonne and Lot, vineyard slopes of the Pyrenees ([[jurançon]], [[irouléguy]]) and vineyards of Haut-Poitou. The vineyards of the Limousin, formerly prolific now confidential, but continues to provide quality wines (vineyards [[Verneuil-sur-Vienne]] and Correze vineyard, including giving the wine country and the Correze "vin paillé" of [[Queyssac-les-Vignes]]).

The region plays a vital role for cereal crops (wheat), herbage and oil (corn, sunflower), which bloom in the valleys of the Adour, Charente and the Garonne. Large agricultural cooperatives are located in the area: Lur Berri, Maïsadour, or Natea Charentes Alliance.

[[Tobacco]] production remains important in [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]] area around [[La Réole]], [[Auros]], [[Monségur, Gironde|Monségur]] and [[Bazas]] (Gironde) in [[Bergerac, Dordogne|Bergerac]], in Dordogne and in the Lot-et-Garonne. Mixed farming has led to the establishment of more localised cultures, but nevertheless considered: Périgord walnuts, Limousin apples, strawberries valleys of the Dordogne and Lot, Charentais melons hillsides, beans ("mojhettes") of val d'Arnoult and the Marais Poitevin, the [[Marmande]] tomatoes, peppers from Landes and the Basque Country, the [[Espelette pepper]].

The agri-food sector is characterised by the presence of several national brands and international production sites, including [[Madrange]] ([[Limoges]]), [[Blédina]] ([[Brive-la-Gaillarde]]), Marie ([[Airvault]] and [[Mirebeau]]) [[Senoble]] ([[Aytré]], near [[La Rochelle]] ), [[Lu, Cestas|Lu]] ([[Cestas]], near [[Bordeaux]]) [[Cémoi]] ([[Bègles]], near [[Bordeaux]]), [[Charal]] ([[Égletons]], in Corrèze), Valade Group ([[Lubersac]], in Corrèze) or [[Lindt & Sprüngli]] ([[Oloron-Sainte-Marie]]). [[Labeyrie, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Labeyrie]] headquartered in [[Came, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Came]] in the [[Pyrénées-Atlantiques]] and [[Delpeyrat]] in [[Mont-de-Marsan]], in the Landes.

=== Forest resources ===

The region has significant forest resources.

The timber industry consists of two main types of activities that mainly use the wood of the Landes forest and secondarily of the Dordogne, Creuse, Corrèze and Haute-Vienne. The primary processing industries (pulp, sawing, slicing, etc.) are very often the result of large companies to perform operations that require large investments. The secondary processing industries (paper / cardboard, furniture, woodwork and plywood, etc.) do not require as many resources. They are more dispersed geographically and in the hands of smaller-scale undertakings or craft.

=== Industries ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2023}}
The region is a major international center in the field of aeronautics and space industry. Together with the neighbouring region [[Occitania (administrative region)|Occitania]], it belongs to the [[Aerospace Valley]] world-class industry cluster. The regional aerospace sector is closely linked to the defence sector, leading to talk of industry "ASD" (aeronautics, space and defence).

The regional [[aircraft industry]] is a world leader for business aircraft, high-tech batteries, high performance composite materials, landing gear systems and turbines for helicopters, the European leader for military aircraft, cockpit equipment and systems, ground tests and flight, launchers, solid propulsion, airborne radars and systems, weapons systems deterrence, atmospheric re-entry technology and national leader in the interior design of 'business aircraft, aircraft maintenance, UAV systems.

Tourism is an important sector in a region with significant assets, starting with a mild and sunny climate, famous vineyards (wine tourism) and many heritage sites, some of international renown. Its wide ocean frontage, stormed by thousands of vacationers - and surfers - every summer is characterised by sandy beaches that often stretch to the horizon. Indirect consequence of increasingly popular for water sports, many surf-related brands (mainly clothing and equipment) are present in the region, earning him the nickname "Glissicon Valley"{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} in reference to [[Silicon Valley]]: [[Rip Curl]], [[Billabong (clothing)|Billabong]], [[Quiksilver]], [[O'Neill (brand)|O'Neill]].

[[File:Lacanau Pro 2009.jpg|thumb|The "[[Surf culture]]" very present on the coast, here in [[Lacanau]], is the reason of the establishment in the area of brands related to this sector ([[Rip Curl]], [[Billabong (clothing)|Billabong]])]]

In the northern part of the coast, the Charente archipelago consists mainly islands of [[île de Ré|Ré]], [[île d'Oléron|Oléron]] and [[île d'Aix|Aix]], where alternate sheltered coves and beaches opening onto the open sea. The aunisiennes coast, near [[La Rochelle]], greet some family seaside resorts such as [[Châtelaillon-Plage]] or [[Fouras]]. Further south, in the heart of the Côte de Beauté (Coast of Beauty), [[Royan]] is one of three major seaside resorts in the region. She has five beaches, not to mention those of neighbouring towns and the Côte Sauvage (Wild Coast) of the peninsula of Arvert, Mecca of surfing and board sports.

Beyond the Gironde estuary begins the Côte d’Argent (Silver Coast), large expanse of almost straight sand bordered by pine trees and large lakes Landes, punctuated by small resorts such as [[Soulac-sur-Mer]], [[Vendays-Montalivet]] (famous for its naturist center) [[Hourtin]], [[Lacanau]], [[Biscarrosse]], [[Mimizan]], [[Hossegor]] or [[Capbreton]].
