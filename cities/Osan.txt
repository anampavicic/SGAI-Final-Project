'''Osan''' ({{Korean|hangul=오산}}; {{IPA|ko|o.san}}) is a [[Subdivisions of South Korea|city]] in [[Gyeonggi]] Province, [[South Korea]], approximately {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Seoul]]. The population of the city is around 200,000.  The local economy is supported by a mix of agricultural and industrial enterprises.

It is famous for one of the largest markets in South Korea, [[Osan Market]], which has been in continuous operation since 1792.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The city was the scene of the [[Battle of Osan|first battle between the US and North Korea]] during the [[Korean War]] in 1950; there is a statue and museum dedicated to UN forces on the outskirts of the city.

The [[United States Air Force]] base named after the city, [[Osan Air Base]], is not actually located in the city, but is instead {{convert|8|km|abbr=on}} south, in the [[Songtan]] district (formerly a separate city) of [[Pyeongtaek]].

[[Osan Station]] is a large subway station located in the heart of Osan. It is part of the [[Seoul Subway Line 1]] and the [[KTX]]. There is a bus terminal next to the subway station and many buses stop in front of the subway station.

==Name==
Osan came to be called by its current name in 1914, at the time of a general reorganization of local governments under [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]]. At that time it became Osan-myeon, part of [[Suwon]]. This name in turn was taken from that of a local stream, the [[Osancheon]]. However, prior to the Japanese occupation, the name had been rendered in [[hanja]] as 鰲山, meaning "[[Trionychidae|soft-shelled turtle]] mountain." Because of the complexity of the 鰲 ("o") character, and because [[crow]]s were abundant in the area, the Japanese changed the name to 烏山, meaning "crow mountain school."{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Administrative districts==
The administrative districts of Osan City consists of six administrative districts and 24 legal districts. Osan City has a population of 228,111 and 97,348 households as of the end of June 2020.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200301132209/http://www.osan.go.kr/osanStats/main.do]."
