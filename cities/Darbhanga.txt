'''Darbhanga''' is the [[List of cities in Bihar by population|fifth largest city]] and [[municipal corporation]] in the state of [[Bihar]] in [[India]], and is considered an important city in [[North Bihar]]. It serves as the headquarters of the [[Darbhanga district]] and the [[Darbhanga division]]. It is held that the name Darbhanga has been derived from ''Dwar Banga'' or ''Dari – Banga'', meaning the 'door of [[Bengal]]'.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Welcome to Darbhanga District {{!}} Official Website of Darbhanga District {{!}} India |url=https://darbhanga.nic.in/ |access-date=2023-05-18 |language=en-US}}</ref>

Darbhanga is one of the oldest cities in India. Musical, folk art, and literary traditions in Sanskrit, [[Urdu]], Hindi and [[Maithili language|Maithili]] have passed down generations in Darbhanga and constitute the city's strong cultural background. It is popularly known as the "Cultural Capital of Bihar" and the "Heart of [[Mithila (region)|Mithilaanchal]]".<ref>{{cite web |author=Culture |url=https://darbhanga.nic.in/culture-heritage/ |title=Darbhanga: The Heart of Mithilaanchal! |work=Darbhanga.nic.in |access-date=30 December 2020}}</ref>

==History==
{{See also|Raj Darbhanga}}
The city was the capital of the [[Raj Darbhanga|Darbhanga Raj]], an [[Zamindars of Bihar|estate]] established in the [[16th century]], containing the [[Anand Bagh Palace|Anandbagh Palace]]. It was constituted as a municipality in 1864. Darbhanga is home to the [[Kameshwar Singh Darbhanga Sanskrit University|Kameshwara Singh Darbhanga Sanskrit University]] (established 1961), which is located on the grounds of the palace, and the [[Lalit Narayan Mithila University]] (established 1972). Darbhanga has a museum housing archaeological materials, as well as historical and handicrafts exhibits.

Darbhanga has been a centre for music since the late 18th century and has produced multiple well-known ''[[dhrupad]]'' (an ancient form of Indian classical music) musicians. A major rail and road junction, Darbhanga trades in agricultural produce, mangoes, and fish. In addition to food processing, the city has a light manufacturing industry.

Darbhanga is situated on a vast alluvial plain, with low-lying areas containing marshes and lakes. Grains, oilseeds, tobacco, sugarcane, and mangoes are important crops in the region.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Darbhanga {{!}} India|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Darbhanga|access-date=17 June 2021|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

Under the [[British Raj]], Darbhanga was a part of Sarkar Tirhut until 1875, when it was constituted into a separate district. Its subdivisions had been constituted earlier – Darbhanga Sadar in 1845, Madhubani in 1866, and Samastipur (then known as Tajpur) in 1867.
The city of Darbhanga is said to have been founded by one Darbhangi Khan, about whom practically nothing is known. It is also held that the name Darbhanga is derived from ''Dwar Banga'' or ''Dar-e-Banga'', meaning the 'door of Bengal'. This etymology does not appear to be accurate as the division between Bengal and Bihar has always been held to be further to the east. Nonetheless, the region has a linguistic and cultural affinity with Bengal.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History {{!}} Welcome to Darbhanga District {{!}} India|url=https://darbhanga.nic.in/history/|access-date=17 June 2021|language=en-US}}</ref>

Excavation at [[Baliraajgadh|Balirajgarh]] revealed brick fortifications dating back to the 2nd century BC.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Indian Archaeology:A Review|last=A.|first=Ghosh|publisher=Archaeological Survey of India|year=1965|location=New Delhi|pages=3–5}}</ref>
