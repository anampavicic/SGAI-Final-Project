According to the results of the [[2014 Moldovan census|2014 census]], the city proper had a population of 532,513, while the population of the Municipality of Chișinău (which includes the city itself and other nearby communities) was 700,000. Chișinău is the most economically prosperous locality in Moldova and its largest transportation hub. Nearly a third of Moldova's population lives in the metro area.

Moldova has a [[Moldovan wine|history of winemaking]] dating back to at least 3,000 BCE, and as the capital city, Chișinău hosts the yearly national wine festival every October.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news |last=Erizanu |first=Paula |date=2023-06-01 |title=I've come to love Chișinău: my home city in Moldova deserves the spotlight |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jun/01/ive-come-to-love-chisinau-my-home-city-moldova-deserves-the-spotlight |access-date=2023-07-05 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite web |date=2021-09-30 |title=Chisinau city guide: Where to eat, drink and stay in Moldova's capital |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/moldova/chisinau-travel-guide-best-hotels-city-restaurants-things-to-do-b1926513.html |access-date=2023-07-05 |website=The Independent |language=en}}</ref> Though the city's buildings were badly damaged during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and earthquakes, there remains a rich architectural heritage, especially in the form of [[Socialist realism]] and [[Brutalist architecture]]. The city's central railway station boasts a [[Architecture of Russia|Russian-Imperial]] architectural style, and maintains direct rail links to Romania. The Swiss-Italian-Russian architect [[Alexander Bernardazzi]] designed many of the city's buildings, including the [[Chișinău City Hall]], [[St. Teodora de la Sihla Church|Church of Saint Theodore]], and the Church of Saint Panteleimon. The city hosts the [[National Museum of Fine Arts, Chișinău|National Museum of Fine Arts]], [[Moldova State University]], Brancusi Gallery, the [[National Museum of History of Moldova]] with over 236,000 exhibits, and bustling markets in the north of the city, including the house where [[Alexander Pushkin]] once resided while in exile from [[Alexander I of Russia]], and which has now been turned into a museum. The city's [[Nativity Cathedral, Chișinău|Nativity Cathedral]], located at the centre of the city and constructed in the 1830s, has been described as a "masterpiece" of [[Neoclassical architecture]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Martus |first=Vladlena |date=2019-06-12 |title=The Nativity Cathedral in Chisinau, a masterpiece of Neoclassicism |url=https://www.itinari.com/the-nativity-cathedral-in-chisinau-a-masterpiece-of-neoclassicism-tcd3 |access-date=2023-07-05 |website=itinari |language=en}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The origin of the city's name is unclear. A theory suggests that the name may come from the [[archaism|archaic]] Romanian word {{lang|ro|chișla}} (meaning "spring", "source of water") and {{lang|ro|nouă}} ("new"), because it was built around a small spring, at the corner of Pușkin and Albișoara streets.<ref>{{Cite web|language=ro |url=http://www.kishinev.info/history_ro/ |title=History of Chișinău |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030722230610/http://www.kishinev.info/history_ro/ |archive-date=22 July 2003 |url-status=dead |website=Kishinev.info |access-date=12 October 2008}}</ref>

The other version, formulated by (or attributed to<ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-05-09 |title=Chişinău is magyar volt? |url=https://www.nyest.hu/hirek/chisinau-is-magyar-volt |access-date=2024-08-27 |website=Nyelv és Tudomány |language=hu}}</ref>) [[Ștefan Ciobanu]], (occasionally to [[Iorgu Iordan]]) Romanian historian and academician, holds that the name was formed the same way as the name of [[Chișineu-Criș|Chișineu]] (alternative spelt as ''Chișinău'') in Western [[Romania]], near the border with Hungary. Its Hungarian name is {{lang|hu|Kisjenő}}, from which the Romanian name originates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basarabiaveche.com/monografia-chisinaului-1925/istoria-orasului-i/ |title=Istoria Orașului I |access-date=2010-06-11 |url-status=dead |website=BasarabiaVeche.Com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301171153/http://www.basarabiaveche.com/monografia-chisinaului-1925/istoria-orasului-i/ |archive-date=1 March 2012 |language=ro}}</ref> Kisjenő comes from {{lang|hu|kis}} "small" and the Jenő, one of the seven [[Hungarian tribes]] that entered the [[Carpathian Basin]] in 896. At least 24 other settlements are named after the Jenő tribe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sebok2.adatbank.transindex.ro/ |title=Transindex – Határon túli magyar helységnévszótár |website=Sebok2.adatbank.transindex.ro |access-date=2016-12-17 |archive-date=22 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222084914/http://sebok2.adatbank.transindex.ro/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://mnytud.arts.unideb.hu/doktorik/racz_anita.pdf |title=Racz Anita |website=Mnytud.arts.unideb.hu |access-date=2016-12-17 |archive-date=14 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714224011/http://mnytud.arts.unideb.hu/doktorik/racz_anita.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> 

A third theory by [https://hu.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_Lajos_(nyelv%C3%A9sz) Kiss Lajos]  linguist and [[Slavic studies|slavist]] hold (as possible origin), that the name came from the [[Cumans|cuman]] ''kešene ("grave", [[kurgan]]) and the [[Karachays|karachayian]]'' "[[cemetery]]", and these came from the [[Persian language|persian]] ''[https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/%DA%A9%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87#Persian kāšāne] ([[house]]) word.''<ref name=":4" />''[https://m.nyest.hu/hirek/chisinau-is-magyar-volt?fbclid=IwY2xjawEtbRNleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHSRuOXxjq2BsVPtX6NySq3EiNgVBjRRTZCmKRa-nkTLjva4cR3BK7LXBnQ_aem_RIM2Hyb3h7_lYQbVDnfGVA]''

Chișinău is known in Russian as {{transl|ru|Kishinyov}} ({{lang|ru|Кишинёв}}, {{IPA|ru|kʲɪʂɨˈnʲɵf|pron}}), while Moldova's Russian-language media call it {{transl|ru|Kishineu}} ({{lang|ru|Кишинэу}}, {{IPA|ru|kʲɪʂɨˈnɛʊ|pron}}). It is written {{lang|gag|script=Latn|Kişinöv}} in the Latin [[Gagauz alphabet]]. It was also written as ''Chișineu'' in pre–20th-century Romanian<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/basarabiainseco00arbugoog|title=Basarabia in secolul XIX ...|last=Zamfir C. Arbure|date=1 January 1898|publisher=C. Göbl|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> and as {{lang|ro|script=Cyrl|Кишинэу}} in the [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet]]. Historically, the English-language name for the city, '''Kishinev''', was based on the modified Russian one because it entered the English language via Russian at the time Chișinău was part of the [[Russian Empire]] (e.g. [[Kishinev pogrom]]). Therefore, it remains a common English name in some historical contexts. Otherwise, the Romanian-based ''Chișinău'' has been steadily gaining wider currency, especially in [[written language]]. The city is also historically referred to as {{langx|lt|Kišiniovas}}, {{langx|hu|Kisjenő}}, {{langx|de|Kischinau}}, ({{IPA|de|ˌkɪʃiˈnaʊ̯|lang|audio=De-Kischinau.ogg}}); {{langx|pl|Kiszyniów}}, ({{IPA|pl|kʲiʂɨˈɲuf|lang|audio=Pl-Kiszyniów.ogg}}); {{langx|uk|Кишинів|Kyshyniv}}, ({{IPA|uk|ˈkɪʃɪnʲiv|lang|audio=LL-Q8798 (ukr)-Tohaomg-Кишинів.wav}}); {{langx|bg|Кишинев|Kishinev}}; {{langx|yi|קעשענעװ|Keshenev}}; or {{langx|tr|Kişinev}}

===Moldavian period===
Founded in 1436 as a [[monastery]] village, the city was part of the [[Moldavia|Principality of Moldavia]] (which, starting with the 16th century became a [[Vassal and tributary states of the Ottoman Empire|vassal state of the Ottoman Empire]], but still retaining its autonomy). At the beginning of the 19th century Chișinău was a small town of 7,000 inhabitants.

===Russian Imperial period===
[[File:Chișinău 1889 1.jpg|thumb|right|Chișinău, 1889]]

In 1812, in the aftermath of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)]], the eastern half of Moldavia [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|was ceded]] by the Ottomans to the [[Russian Empire]]. The newly acquired territories became known as [[Bessarabia]].

Under Russian government, Chișinău became the capital of the newly annexed [[oblast]] (later [[Governorate (Russia)|guberniya]]) of [[Bessarabia Governorate|Bessarabia]]. By 1834, an [[Russian Revival architecture|imperial]] townscape with broad and long roads had emerged as a result of a generous [[development plan]], which divided Chișinău roughly into two areas: the old part of the town, with its irregular building structures, and a newer city centre and station. Between 26 May 1830 and 13 October 1836 the architect [[Avraam Melnikov]] established the [[Nativity Cathedral, Chișinău|Catedrala Nașterea Domnului]] with a magnificent bell tower. In 1840 the building of the [[Triumphal Arch, Chișinău|Triumphal Arch]], planned by the architect Luca Zaushkevich, was completed. Following this the construction of numerous buildings and landmarks began.

On 28 August 1871, Chișinău was linked by [[Calea Ferată din Moldova|rail]] with [[Tiraspol]], and in 1873 with [[Cornești (town), Ungheni|Cornești]]. Chișinău-[[Ungheni]]-[[Iași]] railway was opened on 1 June 1875 in preparation for the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]]. The town played an important part in the war between Russia and the [[Ottoman Empire]], as the main [[staging area]] of the Russian invasion. During the [[Belle Époque]], the mayor of the city was [[Carol Schmidt]], whose contribution to the modernisation of the city is still commemorated by Moldovans.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} {{blockquote|... orașul nostru n-a avut niciodată un primar ca neîntrecutul Carol Schmidt.|Pavel Cuzminschi, "Din amintirile lui Pavel Cuzminschi", în revista "Viața Basarabiei", 1934, nr. 9.}}</ref><ref name="publika">{{cite web |url=http://www.publika.md/un-bust-al-fostului-primar-al-chisinaului--carol-schmidt--a-fost-dezvelit-in-capitala_1921611.html |title=Un bust al fostului primar al Chișinăului, Carol Schmidt, a fost dezvelit în capitală |publisher=Publika .Md |date= |accessdate=14 May 2014 |archive-date=14 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514142341/http://www.publika.md/un-bust-al-fostului-primar-al-chisinaului--carol-schmidt--a-fost-dezvelit-in-capitala_1921611.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Its population had grown to 92,000 by 1862, and to 125,787 by 1900.<ref>[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]</ref>

====Pogroms and pre-revolution====
{{Main|Kishinev pogrom}}
In the late 19th century, especially due to growing anti-Semitic sentiment in the [[Russian Empire]] and better economic conditions in Moldova, many Jews chose to settle in Chișinău. By the year 1897, 46% of the population of Chișinău was Jewish, over 50,000 people.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Kishinev |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/kishinev |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot |access-date=24 June 2018 |archive-date=24 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624121317/https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/kishinev |url-status=live }}</ref>

As part of the pogrom wave organized in the Russian Empire, a large [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] riot was organized in the town on 19–20 April 1903, which would later be known as the [[Chișinău pogrom (1903)|Kishinev pogrom]]. The rioting continued for three days, resulting in 47 Jews dead, 92 severely wounded, and 500 suffering minor injuries.

On 22 August 1905, another violent event occurred: the police opened fire on an estimated 3,000 demonstrating agricultural workers. Only a few months later, on 19–20 October 1905, a further protest occurred, helping to force the hand of Nicholas II in bringing about the [[October Manifesto]]. However, these demonstrations suddenly turned into [[Second Kishinev pogrom|another anti-Jewish pogrom]], resulting in 19 deaths.<ref name=pogrom/>

Following the Russian [[October Revolution]], Bessarabia declared independence from the crumbling empire, as the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]], before joining the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. As of 1919, Chișinău, with an estimated population of 133,000,<ref name=Kaba>{{cite book|last=Kaba|first=John|title=Politico-economic Review of Basarabia|year=1919|publisher=American Relief Administration|location=United States|page=12|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7313/view/1/12/|access-date=3 October 2013|archive-date=5 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005001320/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7313/view/1/12/|url-status=live}}</ref> became the second largest city in Romania.

Between 1918 and 1940, the center of the city undertook large [[renovation]] work. Romania granted important subsidies to its province and initiated large scale investment programs in the infrastructure of the main cities in Bessarabia, expanded the railroad infrastructure and started an extensive program to eradicate illiteracy.

In 1927, the [[Stephen the Great Monument]], by the sculptor [[Alexandru Plămădeală]], was erected. In 1933, the first higher education institution in Bessarabia was established, by transferring the Agricultural Sciences Section of the [[University of Iași]] to Chișinău, as the [[Agricultural State University of Moldova|Faculty of Agricultural Sciences]].

On 28 June 1940, as a direct result of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], Bessarabia was [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|annexed by the Soviet Union]] from Romania, and Chișinău became the capital of the newly created [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]].

Following the Soviet occupation, mass deportations, linked with atrocities, were executed by the [[NKVD]] between June 1940 and June 1941. More than 400 people were [[summarily executed]] in Chișinău in July 1940 and buried in the grounds of the Metropolitan Palace, the Chișinău Theological Institute, and the backyard of the Italian Consulate, where the NKVD had established its headquarters.<ref name=Brez2010>{{cite book|author1=Andrei Brezianu|author2=Vlad Spânu|title=The A to Z of Moldova|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bgcCelRuTboC&pg=PA116|date=26 May 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7211-0|pages=116–|access-date=25 April 2018|archive-date=21 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221141455/https://books.google.com/books?id=bgcCelRuTboC&pg=PA116|url-status=live}}</ref> As part of the policy of political repression of the potential opposition to the Communist power, tens of thousand members of native families were [[Soviet deportations from Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|deported from Bessarabia]] to other regions of the USSR.

[[1940 Vrancea earthquake|A devastating earthquake]] occurred on 10&nbsp;November 1940, measuring 7.4 (or 7.7, according to other sources) on the [[Richter scale]].

In June 1941, in order to recover Bessarabia, Romania entered [[World War II]] under the command of the German [[Wehrmacht]], declaring [[Romania in World War II|war on the Soviet Union]]. Chișinău was severely affected in the chaos of the Second World War. In June and July 1941, the city came under bombardment by Nazi [[Strategic bombing|air raids]]. However, the Romanian and newly Moldovan sources assign most of the responsibility for the damage to Soviet NKVD [[destruction battalion]]s, which operated in Chișinău until 17&nbsp;July 1941, when it was captured by Axis forces.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Virgil |last=Pâslariuc |url=http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/cine-devastat-chisinaul-iulie-1941 |title=Cine a devastat Chișinăul în iulie 1941? |trans-title=Who devastated Chisinau in July 1941? |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620132238/http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/cine-devastat-chisinaul-iulie-1941 |archive-date=20 June 2012 |url-status=dead |website=Historia.ro |language=ro}}</ref>

During the German and Romanian military administration, the city suffered from the [[Holocaust|Nazi extermination policy]] of its Jewish inhabitants, who were transported on trucks to the outskirts of the city and then summarily shot in partially dug pits. The number of Jews murdered during the initial occupation of the city is estimated at 10,000 people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/memories-of-the-holocaust-kishinev-introduction-and-acknowledgements |title=Ghettos: Memories of the Holocaust: Kishinev (Chișinău) (1941–1944) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311011254/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/memories-of-the-holocaust-kishinev-introduction-and-acknowledgements |archive-date=11 March 2017 |website=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |access-date=11 October 2022}}</ref> During this time, Chișinău, part of [[Lăpușna County (Romania)|Lăpușna County]], was the capital of the newly established [[Bessarabia Governorate (Romania)|Bessarabia Governorate]] of Romania.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.rtsa.ro/rtsa/index.php/rtsa/article/view/166|title=Administrarea teritoriului României în timpul celui de-al doilea Război Mondial|first=Viorel|last=Stănică|journal=Transylvanian Review of Administrative Sciences|volume=9|issue=19|year=2007|pages=107–116|language=ro}}</ref>

As the war drew to a conclusion, the city was once again the scene of heavy fighting as German and Romanian troops retreated. Chișinău was captured by the Red Army on 24&nbsp;August 1944 as a result of the [[Second Jassy–Kishinev offensive]].

===Soviet period===
After the war, [[Bessarabia]] was fully reintegrated into the Soviet Union, with around 65 percent of its territory as the Moldavian SSR, while the remaining 35 percent was transferred to the [[Ukrainian SSR]].

Two other waves of deportations of Moldova's native population were carried out by the Soviets, the first one immediately after the Soviet reoccupation of Bessarabia until the end of the 1940s and the second one in the mid-1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moldova.org/en/70-years-ago-today-13-14-june-1941-300000-were-deported-from-bessarabia-221894-eng/|title=70 years ago today: 13–14 June 1941, 300,000 were deported from Bessarabia|first=Autor|last=invitat|website=Moldova.org|date=15 June 2011|access-date=7 April 2019|archive-date=7 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190407144219/https://www.moldova.org/en/70-years-ago-today-13-14-june-1941-300000-were-deported-from-bessarabia-221894-eng/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.languagesoftheworld.info/russia-ukraine-and-the-caucasus/stalins-ethnic-deportations-gerrymandered-ethnic-map.html|title=Stalin's Ethnic Deportations—and the Gerrymandered Ethnic Map|last=Pereltsvaig|first=Asya|website=LanguagesOfTheWorld.info|date=8 October 2014|access-date=25 April 2018|archive-date=26 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426012346/https://www.languagesoftheworld.info/russia-ukraine-and-the-caucasus/stalins-ethnic-deportations-gerrymandered-ethnic-map.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the years 1947 to 1949, the architect [[Alexey Shchusev]] developed a plan with the aid of a team of architects for the gradual reconstruction of the city. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

There was rapid population growth in the 1950s, to which the Soviet administration responded by constructing large-scale housing and palaces in the style of [[Stalinist architecture]]. This process continued under [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who called for construction under the slogan "good, cheaper, and built faster." The new [[architectural style]] brought about dramatic change and generated the style that dominates today, with large [[blocks of flats]] arranged in considerable settlements. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}} These Khrushchev-era buildings are often informally called [[Khrushchyovka]].

The period of the most significant [[urban renewal|redevelopment of the city]] began in 1971, when the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]] of the Soviet Union adopted a decision "On the measures for further development of the city of Kishinev," which secured more than one billion [[Soviet ruble|rubles]] in investment from the [[Budget|state budget]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kishinev.info/architecture_en |title=Chisinau – the capital of Moldova: Architecture |website=kishinev.info |access-date=2010-06-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513230114/http://kishinev.info/architecture_en/ |archive-date=13 May 2010 }}</ref> and continued until the [[independence of Moldova]] in 1991.

On 22 April 1993, the city inaugurated the Monument to the Victims of Jewish Ghettos, a public monument centring on a bronze statue of the [[Prophet|Biblical prophet]] [[Moses]], which serves as a symbol of remembrance to the thousands of Jews who perished during the holocaust. The monument was designed by architect Simeon Shoihet and sculptor Naum Epelbaum. It stands on Ierusalim Street, marking the site of the main entrance to the Chișinău ghetto, which was established in the lower part of the city in July 1941, shortly after the German and Romanian troops occupied the area.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Monument to the Victims of Jewish Ghetto in Chisinau, Moldova |url=https://www.gpsmycity.com/attractions/monument-to-the-victims-of-jewish-ghetto-8352.html |access-date=2023-07-05 |website=GPSmyCity |language=en}}</ref>{{unreliable source inline|date=August 2024}}

==Geography==
[[File:Biserica de lemn din Hirișeni 3.jpg|thumb|"Museum of the village" (''Muzeul satului''), located on the southern outskirts of the city]]
Chișinău is located on the river [[Bâc River|Bâc]], a tributary of the [[Dniester]], at {{Coord|47|0|N|28|55|E|display=inline}}, with an area of {{cvt|120|km2|0}}. The municipality comprises {{cvt|635|km2|0}}.

The city lies in central Moldova and is surrounded by a relatively level landscape with very fertile ground.

Chișinău is roughly equidistant between the borders with Romania (58 kms.) and Ukraine (54 kms.), and between the northernmost (188 kms.) and southernmost (179 kms.) points of Moldova, thus meaning that it is very close to Moldova's geographic centre. 

===Climate===
[[File:Gradina botanica Chisinau (15).jpg|thumb|[[Chisinau Botanical Garden|Botanical garden]]]]
Chișinău has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa'') characterised by warm summers and cold, windy winters. Winter minimum temperatures are often below {{convert|0|°C|0|abbr=on}}, although they rarely drop below {{convert|-10|°C|0|abbr=on}}. In summer, the average maximum temperature is approximately {{convert|25|°C|0|abbr=on}}, however, temperatures occasionally reach {{convert|35|to|40|C|F|abbr=on}} in mid-summer in downtown. Although average [[humidity]] during summer is relatively low, most of the annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] occurs during summer, causing infrequent yet heavy storms.

Spring and autumn temperatures vary between {{convert|16|and|24|C|F|abbr=on}}, and precipitation during this time tends to be lower than in summer but with more frequent yet milder periods of rain.

=== Administration ===

[[File:Mapa chisinau vectorizata232.svg|200px|thumb|Administrative sectors of Chișinău: 1-Centru, 2-Buiucani, 3-Râșcani, 4-Botanica, 5-Ciocana]]

Chișinău is governed by the City Council and the [[Mayor of Chișinău|Mayor]] ({{langx|ro|Primar}}), both elected once every four years.

=== Local government ===

The municipality in its totality elects a mayor and a local council, which then name five ''[[Praetor#Recent Praetors|pretors]]'', one for each sector. They deal more locally with administrative matters. Each sector claims a part of the city and several suburbs:<ref>[http://primar.md/?a=33&i=30 Moldovan Law 431-XIII from 19 April 1995] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722170932/http://primar.md/?a=33&i=30 |date=22 July 2011 }}, ''Monitorul Oficial al Republicii Moldova'', no. 31-32/340, 9 June 1995 {{in lang|ro}}</ref>

Historically, the city was home to fourteen factories in 1919.<ref name=Kaba/> Chișinău is the financial and business capital of Moldova. Its GDP comprises about 60% of the national economy<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistica.md/public/files/publicatii_electronice/Chisinau/Anuar_Chisinau_2013.pdf |title=CHIŞINĂU ÎN CIFRE : ANUAR STATISTIC |website=Statistica.md |access-date=2016-12-17 |archive-date=24 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924120331/http://www.statistica.md/public/files/publicatii_electronice/Chisinau/Anuar_Chisinau_2013.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> reached in 2012 the amount of 52&nbsp;billion lei (US$4&nbsp;billion). Thus, the GDP per capita of Chișinău stood at 227% of the Moldova's average. Chișinău has the largest and most developed mass media sector in Moldova, and is home to several related companies ranging from leading television networks and radio stations to major newspapers. All national and international banks (15) have their headquarters located in Chișinău.

Notable sites around Chișinău include Cineplex Loteanu, the new malls [[Malldova|MallDova]], Port Mall and best-known retailers, such as N1, Linella, Kaufland, Fourchette and Metro. While many locals continue to shop at the [[bazaar]]s, many upper class residents and tourists shop at the retail stores and at MallDova. Jumbo, an older mall in the Botanica district, and Sun City, in the centre, are more popular with locals.

Several amusement parks exist around the city. A [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era one is located in the Botanica district, along the three lakes of a major park, which reaches the outskirts of the city centre. Another, the modern Aventura Park, is located farther from the centre. The Chișinău State Circus, which used to be in a grand building in the Râșcani sector, has been inactive for several years due to a poorly funded renovation project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.exutopia.com/urban-exploration-abandoned-soviet-circus/|title=Sneaking into an Abandoned Soviet Circus in Moldova|work=Ex Utopia|date=25 November 2013|access-date=9 July 2021}}</ref>

Chișinău's growth plan was developed in the 19th century. In 1836 the construction of the [[Kishinev Cathedral]] and its [[Bell tower|belfry]] was finished. The belfry was demolished in Soviet times and was rebuilt in 1997. Chișinău also displays a tremendous number of Orthodox churches and 19th-century buildings around the city such as [[Ciuflea Monastery]] or the [[Transfiguration Church, Chișinău|Transfiguration Church]]. Much of the city is made from limestone quarried from [[Cricova]], leaving a famous [[Cricova (winery)|wine cellar]] there.

Many modern-style buildings have been built in the city since 1991. There are many office and shopping complexes that are modern, renovated or newly built, including Kentford, SkyTower, and [[Unión Fenosa]] headquarters. However, the old Soviet-style clusters of living blocks are still an extensive feature of the cityscape.

===Events and festivals===
Chișinău, as well as Moldova as a whole, still show signs of ethnic culture. Signs that say "Patria Mea" (English: My homeland) can be found all over the capital. While few people still wear traditional Moldavian attire, large public events often draw in such original costumes.

''Moldova National Wine Day'' and ''Wine Festival'' take place every year in the first weekend of October, in Chișinău. The events celebrate the autumn harvest and recognises the country's long history of winemaking, which dates back to at least 3,000 BCE.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/media/photogallery/moldova-national-wine-day/25130047.html |title=Moldova's 'National Wine Day' |website=Rferl.org |date=2013-10-08 |access-date=2016-12-17 |archive-date=14 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914160321/http://www.rferl.org/media/photogallery/moldova-national-wine-day/25130047.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://moldova-online.travel/2013/09/national-wine-day-in-chisinau/ |title=National Wine Day in Chisinau |website=Moldova-online.travel |access-date=2016-12-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629020851/http://moldova-online.travel/2013/09/national-wine-day-in-chisinau/ |archive-date=29 June 2016}}</ref> Moldova has been called the wine capital of Europe and its yearly festival is a major cultural and tourist event, and every year the streets are filled with people enjoying food, wine, dance, and music taking over the streets.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3">{{Cite web |date=2018-09-13 |title=On the trail of Moldovan wine |url=https://www.euronews.com/green/2018/09/13/on-the-trail-of-moldovan-wine |access-date=2023-07-05 |website=[[Euronews]] |language=en}}</ref> Moldova's most-awarded sommelier Mihai Druta has described Moldovan wine as being about "small producers and family wineries making premium wine.
