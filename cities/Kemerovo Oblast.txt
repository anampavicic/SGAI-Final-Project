'''Kemerovo Oblast''' ({{langx|ru|Ке́меровская о́бласть|Kemerovskaya oblast'}}, {{IPA-all|ˈkʲemʲɪrəfskəjə ˈobləsʲtʲ kʊzˈbas}}), also known as '''Kuzbass''' ({{langx|ru|Кузба́сс}}),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kuzbass85.ru/2019/03/27/kemerovskaya-oblast-ofitsialno-stala-kuzbassom/ |title=Кемеровская область официально стала Кузбассом » Кузбасс главное |date=March 27, 2019 |language=ru-RU |access-date=2020-01-29 |archive-date=January 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200129134926/http://kuzbass85.ru/2019/03/27/kemerovskaya-oblast-ofitsialno-stala-kuzbassom/ |url-status=dead}}</ref> after the [[Kuznetsk Basin]], is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (an [[oblast]]). [[Kemerovo]] is the [[administrative center]] and largest city of the oblast. Kemerovo Oblast is one of Russia's most urbanized regions, with over 70% of the population living in its nine principal cities. Its ethnic composition is predominantly [[Russians|Russian]], but native [[Shors]] and [[Siberian Tatars|Kalmak Siberian Tatars]] also live in the oblast, along with [[Ukrainians]], [[Volga Tatars]], and [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]]. The population recorded during the [[2021 Russian census|2021 Census]] was&nbsp;2,600,923.

==Geography==
Kemerovo Oblast is located in southwestern [[Siberia]], where the [[West Siberian Plain]] meets the [[South Siberian Mountains]]. The oblast, which covers an area of {{convert|95500|km2|sp=us}},<ref name="Area">{{cite web |url=http://perepis2002.ru/ct/html/TOM_01_03.htm |title=Территория, число районов, населённых пунктов и сельских администраций по субъектам Российской Федерации (''Territory, Number of Districts, Inhabited Localities, and Rural Administration by Federal Subjects of the Russian Federation'') |access-date=2011-11-01 |author=Федеральная служба государственной статистики (Federal State Statistics Service) |date=2004-05-21 |work=Всероссийская перепись населения 2002 года (All-Russia Population Census of 2002) |publisher=Federal State Statistics Service |language=Russian}}</ref> shares a border with [[Tomsk Oblast]] in the north, [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]] and the [[Republic of Khakassia]] in the east, the [[Altai Republic]] in the south, and with [[Novosibirsk Oblast]] and [[Altai Krai]] in the west.
[[Verkhny Zub]] peak, the highest point of the oblast, is located in the eastern border.<ref name="GЕ">[[Google Earth]]</ref>

===Climate===
The [[climate]] of the oblast is continental: [[winter]]s are cold and long, [[summer]]s are warm, but short. The average January temperature ranges from {{convert|-17|to|-20|C}}, the average in July is {{convert|17|to|18|C}}. Average annual [[precipitation]] ranges from {{cvt|300|mm|sp=us}} on the plains and the foothills of up to {{cvt|1000|mm|sp=us}} or more in mountainous areas. The duration of the frost-free period is 100&nbsp;days in the north area, and up to 120&nbsp;days in the south of the Kuznetsk Basin.

===Environment===
The environmental conditions in Kuznetsk Basin are heavily influenced by the regional industrial activities, especially, by coal mining. The report about the environmental conditions in Kemerovo region from 2014 indicated that there are more than 20 thousand of enterprises, emitting more than 250 types of atmospheric pollutants,<ref name=":0">{{cite report |date=2015 |title=Report about the environmental conditions in Kemerovo region in 2014 |url=http://kuzbasseco.ru/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NEW_DOKLAD-2014.pdf |publisher=Administration of Kemerovo region}}</ref> where most urban areas with the worst air quality are located in the Kuznetsk Basin: Novokuznetsk, Mezhdurechensk, Myski, Kaltan, Polysaevo, Belovo and Leninsk-Kuznetskiy.<ref name=":0" />

Unlike other Siberian cities, where atmospheric concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> has been decreasing in recent years, the concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> is increasing in the cities of the Kuznetsk Basin due to the increasing coal production in the region.<ref name=":1" />

==History==
The oblast was established on January&nbsp;26, 1943,<ref name="Charter2">Charter of Kemerovo Oblast, Article&nbsp;2</ref> but it has considerably older antecedents. [[Shors]], [[Teleuts]] and [[Siberian Tatars]] are native peoples of the region. The oldest city in Kemerovo Oblast is [[Novokuznetsk]], founded in 1618, soon after [[Cossack]] [[ataman]] [[Yermak Timofeyevich|Yermak]]'s push into Siberia.

The territory of modern Kemerovo Oblast has been inhabited for several thousand years. In 1618, [[Kuznetsk fort]] was established in the south of the future oblast to protect the land from Russian and Mongolian [[Dzungar people|Dzhungarian]] invaders. During the 19th century, the territory of the modern oblast was a part of [[Tomsk Governorate]].

===Soviet period===
After the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, Kuzbass experienced significant strife as part of the [[Russian Civil War]]. A [[Peasant rebellion of Sorokino|major peasant rebellion]] took place in the region in early 1921, but was suppressed by the [[Red Army]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://visit-kuzbass.ru/en/chto-posetit/dostoprimechatelnosti/pamyatniki/240-bratskaya-mogila-krasnoarmeycev-uk.html |title=Common Grave of Red Army Soldiers |work=Kemerovo Oblast |access-date=20 July 2019 |archive-date=August 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803024001/http://visit-kuzbass.ru/en/chto-posetit/dostoprimechatelnosti/pamyatniki/240-bratskaya-mogila-krasnoarmeycev-uk.html |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1930, Kuzbass became part of the [[West Siberian Krai]], and then the [[Novosibirsk Oblast]]. Post revolutionary period was characterized by the transition to a planned economy, the creation of the Ural-Kuzbass industrial complex development of the coal, metallurgical and chemical industries Kuzbass Kemerovo Coke built, Kuznetsk Metallurgical Combine, a lot of new mines. Industrial enterprises are being built near the workers' settlements, which quickly became a city: Kiselevsk Osinniki Krasnobrodsky, Tashtagol Kaltan Mezhdurechensk and others.

During the [[Great Patriotic War]], Kemerovo region became a major supplier of coal and metal. From Novokuznetsk steel produced over 50,000 tanks and 45,000 aircraft. In Kuzbass from the occupied areas were evacuated equipment 71 enterprises, most of which have remained in the Kuzbass.

In January&nbsp;26, 1943, the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[USSR Supreme Soviet]] issued a decree, decided to allocate from the Novosibirsk Oblast of Kuzbass and the establishment on its territory of Kemerovo region with administrative center in the city of Kemerovo. In the new Oblast included 17.5% of the Novosibirsk region, 9 of the 12 cities of regional subordination, 17 of the 20 workers' settlements, 23 of the 75 districts. The population of the Kemerovo Oblast was 42% of the total population of the Novosibirsk Oblast.

[[Aeroflot Flight 593]] crashed into a mountain range in the Kemerovo Oblast in 1994.

==Politics==
[[File:Kemerovo Soviet Square.jpg|thumb|Building of the Oblast Government]]

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Kemerovo CPSU Committee (who in reality had the highest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). After the abolition of Article 6 of the Constitution of the USSR in March 1990, the CPSU lost its monopoly on power. The head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of Kemerovo Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Kemerovo Oblast is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].

Kemerovo Oblast is one of Russia's most important industrial regions, with some of the world's largest deposits of coal. The south of the region is dominated by [[metallurgy]] and the [[mining]] industry, as well as [[mechanical engineering]] and chemical production.

The [[Evraz Group]] and an ore subsidiary Evrazruda operate [[iron ore]] mining and processing facilities along with the [[Raspadskaya coal mine|Raspadskaya]], Yuzhkuzbassugol, the Siberian holding company [[SIBPLAZ]]. Coal and [[coke (fuel)|coking coal]] mines are located there. Prokopevsk, Kiselevsk, and Andzhero-Sudzhensk are coal-producing centers.
The [[Zhernovskoye coal mine]] has reserves amounting to 163 million tonnes of coking coal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ara2010.nlmk.com/performance_review/coke_coal.html |title=Zhernovskoye Coal Mine |year=2013 |publisher=nlmk.com |access-date=2013-07-07}}</ref> In November 2021, the [[Listvyazhnaya mine disaster]] took place, in which many people were trapped.
