'''Dodoma Region''' (''Mkoa wa Dodoma'' in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]) is one of [[Tanzania]]'s 31 administrative [[Regions of Tanzania|regions]]. The regional capital is the city of [[Dodoma]]. Dodoma is located in central Tanzania, bordered by [[Singida Region|Singida region]] to the west, [[Manyara Region|Manyara region]] to the north, [[Iringa Region|Iringa region]] to the south, and [[Morogoro Region|Morogoro region]] to the east. Dodoma region hosts the nation's capital city, where the legislative assembly of [[Politics of Tanzania#Legislative branch|Bunge]] is based. Dodoma region also hosts one of the largest universities in Tanzania: [[University of Dodoma]]. The region is the home of the [[Tanzanian wine]] industry, which is the second largest wine industry on the continent after [[South Africa]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/regions-tanzania|title=Tanzania wine region|website=Wine Searcher|access-date=2022-07-11}}</ref> According to the 2022 national census, the region had a population of 3,085,625; in the 2012 national census, the population was 2,083,588.<ref>{{Cite report|url=https://www.nbs.go.tz/index.php/sw/sensa-2022/807-matokaeo-ya-mwanzo-ya-sensa-ya-watu-na-makazi-ya-mwaka-2022|title=Matokeo ya Mwanzo ya Sensa ya Watu na Makazi|publisher=Government of [[Tanzania]]|access-date=2023-02-02}}</ref> <ref name="2022_census">{{cite web |title=Matokeo ya Sensa |url=https://sensa.nbs.go.tz/ |website=sensa.nbs.go.tz |publisher=[[National Bureau of Statistics (Tanzania)]] |access-date=1 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221031164518/https://sensa.nbs.go.tz/ |archive-date=31 October 2022 |location=[[Dodoma|Dodoma, Tanzania]] |language=sw |url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
Dodoma's name derives from the [[Gogo people|Gogo]] word ''Idodomya'', the place where an elephant sunk into the mud.{{r|Dodoma_guide}}

The city of [[Dodoma]], from which the region gets its name, is the largest city and capital of the region. It began as a small ''[[Gogo people|Gogo]]'' village in the early 19th century, consisting of several traditional ''[[Tembe (Arab house)|tembe]]'' houses.<ref name="Finke2003">{{cite book|last=Finke|first=Jens|title=Tanzania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=16--sm53nX4C&pg=PA244|year=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-85828-783-6|page=244|access-date=27 September 2016|archive-date=1 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801023826/https://books.google.com/books?id=16--sm53nX4C&pg=PA244|url-status=live}}</ref> The city was formally established in 1907 by German colonists during construction of the [[Central Line (Tanzania)|Tanzanian central railway]]. The region has a long history of famine and economic difficulties. Along with [[Kondoa District|Kondoa]] and [[Singida Region|Singida]] it was struck hard by the famine of the 1910s. One report by a British officer in Dodoma in December 1916 reported that "the whole district has been ransacked for cattle". The Germans had killed 26,000 animals, and the British, nearly 5,700.<ref name="MH">{{cite book|title=A Modern History of Tanganyika|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m0dalboHfXgC&pg=PA269|date=10 May 1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-29611-3|pages=269&ndash;70|access-date=27 September 2016|archive-date=1 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801021956/https://books.google.com/books?id=m0dalboHfXgC&pg=PA269|url-status=live}}</ref> Problems continued throughout 1917, and in November 1917 drought turned it into a crisis. Some 30,000 people died; about 1 in 5 of the population of the district. Thousands of people emigrated, and others sold starving cattle for just a shilling at the market in Dodoma. Smallpox was prevalent, and the [[Spanish flu]] epidemic killed an estimated 50,000&ndash;80,000 in Tanganyika between 1918 and 1920.<ref name="MH"/>

When the British took over the country, they favoured [[Dar es Salaam]] and [[Arusha]], and Dodoma began to decline in importance. It declined further in the 1960s when the Tanzam Highway was built by the Chinese, connecting Dar es Salaam to Morogoro and Iringa.<ref name="Finke2003"/> On 9 December 1961, Tanganyika won independence from Britain, and Dodoma remained the capital of the central province. In 1963, the provinces of the new nation were divided into smaller administrative units and were renamed regions, and the Dodoma region was established.<ref name="Lawrence2009">{{cite book|last=Lawrence|first=David|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jFASR-Ob0NUC&pg=PA21|title=Tanzania and Its People|date=12 March 2009|publisher=Intercontinental Books|isbn=978-1-4414-8692-9|page=21|access-date=27 September 2016|archive-date=1 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801023037/https://books.google.com/books?id=jFASR-Ob0NUC&pg=PA21|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1973, the Tanzanian government announced that the administrative capital would be moved from Dar es Salaam to a more central location to better serve the needs of the people.

==Geography==
Dodoma is the 8th largest region by area after Manyara region.

A total of 220,989 hectares, or 5.44 percent of the region's 4,131,100 hectares of land, are covered by natural forest reserves. The majority of these natural forest reserves are in the Chamwino (100,391 hectares), Kondoa (37,199 hectares), Bahi (28,058 hectares), Mpwapwa (22,958 hectares), Kongwa (11,883 hectares), and Chemba regions (20,500 hectares).{{r|Dodoma_guide}}

===Climate===
Due to irregular and low rainfall, the Dodoma region is primarily semi-arid. Rainfall in the region usually falls between November/December and April/May in a single rainy season. Often, storms bring strong rains that cause flash floods. The annual total precipitation ranges from 500 to 800&nbsp;mm. Although the temperature in the area varies depending on elevation, it typically ranges from around 15&nbsp;Â°C in July to 30&nbsp;Â°C in October. There can be significant temperature changes between day and night, with afternoons reaching temperatures of up to 35&nbsp;Â°C and nights reaching temperatures of around 10&nbsp;Â°C.{{r|Dodoma_guide}}

==Economy==
In terms of socio-economic statistics, the Dodoma region is ranked reasonably well. The region's gross domestic product (GDP) was Tsh 2,635,574 million in 2015, and GDP per capita was Tsh 1,188,343 according to the 2017 Tanzania human development report (THDR). Dodoma received a human development index1 (HDI) score of 0.479, placing it 17th out of 26 regions in mainland Tanzania. Tanzania's mainland has an average HDI score of 0.614. The life expectancy in Dodoma was 64.4 years; longer than average for the Tanzanian mainland (61.7 years).{{r|Dodoma_guide}}

===Agriculture===
The agriculture industry dominates the economy of the Dodoma region, with [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence]] farming as well as commercial farming. A total of 376,924 out of 450,305 private households in the area (84 percent) were involved in agriculture according to the 2012 population and housing census. These homes were primarily located in Chamwino district council (68,162 households). The percentage of households engaged in agriculture in districts within the Dodoma region ranged up to 90% in Kondoa and Mpwapwa, and 93 percent in Bahi and Chemba district councils, while in Dodoma city 54% of households were employed in agriculture.{{r|Dodoma_guide}}

The central plateau zone, where the Dodoma region lies, is well known for producing fruits like [[grape]]s, [[mango]], [[papaya]], [[guava]], [[baobab]], [[tamarind]], and [[Date palm|dates]]. The main cash crop grown by farmers among the fruits is grapes. Additionally, many farmers in Dodoma city and adjacent districts rely heavily on the production of grapes for their livelihood. Dodoma district produces over 70% of the grapes in the area, with 30% of the output from Chamwino and Bahi. Jam, juice, jelly, wine, grape seed extracts, raisins, vinegar, and grapeseed oil are all products made from grapes. Smallholder farmers who grow grapes on their own farms are the main producers of grapes in Dodoma.{{r|Dodoma_guide}}

Maize, sorghum, millet, rice, pulses (mostly pigeon peas), cassava, potatoes, bananas, and plantains are some of the principal food crops grown in Dodoma. The [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] climate favors the production of paddy, sorghum, millet, and other oil-seed crops. The main food crops grown in the area are maize and sorghum, primarily in the districts of Kongwa, Chemba, Kondoa, Mpwapwa, and Chamwino. In terms of maize production, Kongwa is the top district, followed by Kondoa and Chemba. Crops like cassava and potatoes are only grown in small amounts.{{r|Dodoma_guide}}

The second most important economic sector in the Dodoma region is livestock farming. In Dodoman villages, livestock prevent malnutrition, produce revenue, and determine the economic and [[Social status|social]] standing of households. 99 percent of the cattle raised is of an indigenous type that does well in the local climate. The Tanzania meat company (TMC) and S&Y Gourmet were the two businesses in the area that processed livestock products in the fiscal year that ended in June 2017. TMC processed 1,400 tonnes of goat and sheep meat for export in addition to 6,562.5 tonnes of beef for domestic consumption. 250 tonnes of cattle and 90 tonnes of goats and sheep were processed for export alone by S & Y Gourmet. 250 tonnes of beef and 1,490 tonnes of processed sheep and goats were transported to [[Vietnam]], [[Iraq]], [[Morocco]], and [[Oman]].{{r|Dodoma_guide}}

===Industry===
After agriculture, service workers, shop and stall sales workers are the second-most significant occupation in the area, employing around 5.3% of the active population. The [[artisan]]s, which account for 3.3% of the active population, rank third. Census data also reveal that street sellers and related work are expanding quickly and are among the most important jobs in the region, accounting for 1.7% of the region's population aged 10 and over.{{r|Dodoma_guide}}

As of June 2018, the Dodoma region had the following profile: there were 2,325 industries, of which 1,262 (54% of the total) were engaged in the milling of maize, 436 (19%) in the processing of sunflower oil, 292 (13%) in tailoring, 6 (or 0.3%) in the processing of wine, 45 (or 1.9%) in [[carpentry]], and the remaining few were engaged in the production of various goods. Dodoma is home to more than 52 distinct types of minerals, but local miners have had difficulty extracting them due to a lack of funding and up-to-date technical know-how. These include [[copper]] deposits in Tambi, Kimagai, and Kinusi in the Mpwapwa District; [[nickel]] deposits at Haneti in the Chamwino District; [[manganese]] deposits at Kibakwe in the Mpwapwa District; silica; [[enstatite]] in the Mpwapwa District; and [[scapolite]] (marialite-meionite) deposits in the Rubeho Mountains.{{r|Dodoma_guide}}

===Infrastructure===
The Dodoma region is easily accessible all year round thanks to its good road infrastructure. There is efficient transfer of commodities to and from neighboring regions. Most rural communities are well connected with year-round accessible roadways. The overall length of the region's road system is 8,183&nbsp;km, of which 555&nbsp;km are trunk highways, 1,142&nbsp;km are regional roads, 3,054&nbsp;km are district roads, and 3,432&nbsp;km are village roads.{{r|Dodoma_guide}}

Dodoma region is connected by a paved trunk road (T3) that starts in [[Dar es Salaam]] on the coast, passes through [[Morogoro]], [[Dodoma]], and [[Singida]], and ends at the [[Rwanda]] border. In 2016, a paved trunk road (T5) to [[Iringa]] was opened.<ref>{{cite web|title=New roads to boost local economies in Dodoma-Iringa|url=http://www.dailynews.co.tz/index.php/home-news/50356-new-roads-to-boost-local-economies-in-dodoma-iringa|website=Daily News|access-date=17 June 2016|archive-date=6 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606141930/http://dailynews.co.tz/index.php/home-news/50356-new-roads-to-boost-local-economies-in-dodoma-iringa|url-status=live}}</ref> The trunk road (T5) to [[Babati]] in [[Manyara Region]] was completed as of early 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dodoma Roads Network |url=http://tanroads.go.tz/uploads/documents/en/1446554505-Dodoma%20Roads%20Network.pdf |website=Tanroads |access-date=17 June 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624063504/http://tanroads.go.tz/uploads/documents/en/1446554505-Dodoma%20Roads%20Network.pdf |archive-date=24 June 2016 }}</ref> Dodoma lies along the [[Cape to Cairo Road|great North road]], a major infrastructural network of Africa which connects [[Cairo]] to [[Cape Town]].<ref name="Lawrence2009"/>

The efficacy of the road network is measured by the condition of the roads during the rainy season. Dodoma region is fortunate in that more than half (75.9%) of its total road network is either 510&nbsp;km of [[Asphalt concrete|asphalt]] or 1,565.2&nbsp;km of gravel, both of which are open all year round, including during the rainy season.{{r|Dodoma_guide}}

===Railways===
There are 9 [[railway]] stations in the Dodoma region, with the Kikombo, Ihumwa, Dodoma urban, and Zuzu stations owned by Dodoma city council; Bahi and Kigwe stations owned by the Bahi District; Godegode Msagali and Gulwe stations by the Mpwapwa District, and Igandu station by Chamwino.{{r|Dodoma_guide}}
