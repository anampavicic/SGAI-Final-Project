'''Corumbá''' ({{IPA|pt|koɾũˈba}}) is a [[List of municipalities in Mato Grosso do Sul|municipality]] in the Brazilian state of [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], 425&nbsp;km northwest of [[Campo Grande]], the state's capital. It has a population of approximately 112,000 inhabitants, and its economy is based mainly on [[agriculture]], [[animal husbandry]], [[mineral extraction]], and [[tourism]], being the gateway to the biggest [[wetland]]s of the world, the [[Pantanal]]. Due to its border with [[Bolivia]], [[Bolivians in Brazil]] constitute a significant portion of the city's population, forming a distinct cultural community.<ref name=":0" /> The city is served by [[Corumbá International Airport]].

Corumbá is the westernmost and northernmost city in Mato Gosso do Sul, and it is by far the largest municipality by area in that state, composing 18% of its territory. It is also the eleventh largest municipality in Brazil and the largest outside [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]] and [[Pará]]. The territory of Corumbá has an enclaved municipality within it: [[Ladário]].

On September 20, 2021, the record high temperature of {{convert|43.9|°C}} was registered.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tempo.inmet.gov.br/ValoresExtremos/TMAX |title=INMET :: Tempo |website=tempo.inmet.gov.br |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806100024/https://tempo.inmet.gov.br/ValoresExtremos/TMAX |archive-date=2020-08-06}} </ref> On June 22, 1933, the record low temperature of {{convert|0.8|°C}} was recorded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://portal.inmet.gov.br/normais|title = Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia - INMET}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Corumbá, Brazil (1916).jpg|thumb|right|Corumbá, 1916]]
[[File:NOB-RioParaguai.jpg|thumb|right|Bridge Rio Branco in Corumbá]]
Founded as a military outpost and colony in 1778 by the Spanish. It became strategically important with the opening of the [[Paraguay River]] to international trade after the [[Paraguayan War]] (1865–70). Nearby are the buttes of Mt Urucum, which contain vast mineral deposits. In 1878 it was raised to the category of [[city]].

In 1938, the governments of Brazil and Bolivia agreed to begin consutrction on the [[Santa Cruz-Corumbá Railway]], a section of the [[General Manuel Belgrano Railway]] that connected [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], Bolivia with the Brazilian state of [[Mato Grosso]]. The railway was finished in 1955.<ref>{{cite news |first= Anthony |last= Patric |title= Railway Across South America Nears Reality |url= http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1947/01/19/page/22/article/railway-across-south-america-nears-reality |publisher= Chicato Tribune |page= 22 |date= January 19, 1947 |access-date=2 May 2016 |quote= The strategical railroad linking the Brazilian Atlantic port of Santos to the Chilean Pacific port of Arica is nearing reality.

==Pantanal==
{{Main|Pantanal}}
The ecoregion [[Pantanal]] is the most important plain of all humid areas in South America. Its large territory meets in the [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], is known as South Pantanal and the city of Corumbá serves as its entrance door. The Pantanal of Mato Grosso do Sul is recognized as one of the most exuberant and diversified natural reserves on the planet.

The great diversity of the fauna is one of its great attractions: [[yacare caiman|caiman]], [[anaconda]]s, fish, [[capybara]]s, [[South American tapir|tapirs]], [[hyacinth macaw]]s, herons, and [[Jabiru|jabiru storks]], among others. The Pantanal received the recognition as National Patrimony in the Constitution of 1988 and as Patrimony of the Humanity and Reserve of the Biosfera from [[UNESCO]].

According to [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (1999), there exist in the Pantanal 650 species of birds, 80 of mammals, 260 of fish and 50 of reptiles. It is a region of great importance for preservation of biodiversity, considered one of the biggest centers of reproduction of fauna of America. Already more than 263 species of fish, 122 species of mammals, 93 species of reptiles, 1,132 species of butterflies, 656 species of birds and 1,700 species of plants have been cataloged there.

==Relations with Bolivia==
The municipality of Corumbá is bordered simultaneously by [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]], a situation that is known as ''tríplice'' border. Its urban area borders on the Bolivian cities of [[Puerto Suárez]] and [[Puerto Quijarro]], which together make up a ''Free Zone'' for purchases of imported products and Bolivian crafts, the limit of which is the end of Ramon Gomes Road. The border with Paraguay is at the south extremity of the municipality in the agricultural zone. As of 2014, Bolivians are asked to prove if they have over the equivalent of $800 to receive a temporary visa.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=le Blanc|first=Sophie|date=2016|title=Immigrant Entrepreneurs in the City: Collaboration, Competition, and Survival in São Paulo|url=https://udspace.udel.edu/bitstream/handle/19716/21162/2016_le-BlancSophie_PhD.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y|journal=University of Delaware|pages=95}}</ref>

As a result, Corumbá has one of the highest proportions of [[Bolivians in Brazil|Bolivian-Brazilians]] of any city. Ethnographic reports have found that Bolivians in the city are regularly subject to [[Racism in Brazil|racial]] discrimination.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=da Costa|first=Gustavo Villela Lima|date=April 2015|title=Os Bolivianos Em Corumbá-MS: Conflitos E Relações De Poder Na Fronteira|url=https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0104-93132015000100035|journal=Universidade Federal do Mato Grosso do Sul|volume=21|pages=35–63|doi=10.1590/0104-93132015v21n1p035|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==Urbanization and demographic information==
Corumbá consists of two areas. The lower area is where the old village of notable [[architecture]] lies, close to the port. The upper area, newer and much bigger, is chessboard-shaped. Its architecture is not like other old Brazilian cities, where the predominant architectural style is the colonial [[Romanticism|romantic]] [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. Its architecture is [[Italy|Italian]] [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]], the same as central [[Asunción]], the old suburbs of [[Buenos Aires]], the towns of the countryside of the [[Uruguay]], and the majority of the southwestern [[Rio Grande do Sul]].

Its urbanization rate is very high, reaching around 90%. In recent years, due to a better quality of life, the population is aging and the fertility rate is decreasing.
