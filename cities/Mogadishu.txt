==Etymology==
The origins of the name ''Mogadishu'' (Muqdisho) have many theories but it is most likely derived from a morphology of the [[Somali language|Somali]] words ''Muuq'' and ''Disho'' which mean "Sight Killer" or "Blinder", possibly referring to the city's blinding beauty.<ref>Horn of Africa – Volume 2, Issue 4 – Page 34, 1979</ref> Magh'ad-e shāh ({{langx|fa|مقعد شاه}}) is another phrase from which the name of Mogadishu is believed to be derived, meaning "seat of the Shah/merchant Shah" which reflects the city's early Persian influence.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=October 1989 |title=David D.

====Sarapion====
The ancient city of [[Sarapion]] is believed to have been the predecessor state of Mogadishu. It is mentioned in the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'', a Greek travel document dating from the first century AD, as one of a series of commercial ports on the Somali littoral.{{sfn|Jama|1962|p=19}} According to the ''Periplus'', maritime trade already connected peoples in the Mogadishu area with other communities along the Indian Ocean.{{sfn|Huntingford|1980|p=94}}<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Joseph |first1=Dan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5aBxDwAAQBAJ&q=sarapion&pg=PA7 |title=Inside Al-Shabaab: The Secret History of Al-Qaeda's Most Powerful Ally |last2=Maruf |first2=Harun |date=2018-10-01 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-03751-0 |pages=7 |language=en}}</ref>

During ancient times Mogadishu was part of the [[Somali maritime history|Somali city-states]] that engaged in a lucrative trade network connecting [[Somali people|Somali]] merchants with [[Phoenicia]], [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemic Egypt]], Greece, [[Parthia|Parthian Persia]], [[Sabaeans]], [[Nabataea]] and the [[Roman Empire]].

===Foundation and origins===
The founding ethnicity of Mogadishu and its subsequent sultanate has been a topic of intrigue in [[Somali Studies]]. [[Ioan Lewis]] and [[Enrico Cerulli]] believed that the city was founded and ruled by a council of Arab and Persian families.<ref name="LewisPeoples">I.M. Lewis, ''Peoples of the Horn of Africa: Somali, Afar, and Saho, Issue 1'', (International African Institute: 1955), p. 47.</ref><ref name="LewisModern">I.M. Lewis, ''The modern history of Somaliland: from nation to state'', (Weidenfeld & Nicolson: 1965), p. 37</ref><ref>Renewers of the Age Holy Men and Social Discourse in Colonial Benaadir - Page 44</ref> However, the reference I.M Lewis and Cerulli received traces back to one 19th century text called the Kitab Al-Zunuj, which has been discredited by modern scholars as unreliable and unhistorical.<ref>H. Neville Chittick, "The East Coast, Madagascar and the Indian Ocean", in [[John Fage|J. D. Fage]] and R. Oliver (eds.), ''The Cambridge History of Africa, Volume 3: From c.1050 to c. 1600'' (Cambridge University Press, 1977), pp. 183–231, at 194–195 and 198. ''The account in the [[Book of the Zanj]] of pre-Islamic immigration of Arabs from Himyar in southern Arabia, their founding of most of the more important towns of the coast from Mogadishu to Mombasa, and also Kilwa, together with their subsequent conversion to Islam, is uncorroborated by other sources and unsupported by the archaeological evidence and must be dismissed as unhistorical. The suggestion that these families must have come from Siraf to the Somali coast before the eleventh century must therefore be regarded as unproven''.</ref><ref>The Cambridge History of Africa, Volum 3 – Page 198</ref><ref>The Archaeology of Islam in Sub-Saharan Africa By Timothy Insoll – Page 62</ref><ref>Gervase Mathew, "The East African Coast until the Coming of the Portuguese", in R.

Thus, the Persian and Arab founding "myths" are regarded as an outdated false colonialist reflection on Africans ability to create their own sophisticated states.<ref name="Jama">{{cite book |last=Jama |first=Ahmed |title=The Origins and Development of Mogadishu AD 1000 to 1850: A Study of the Urban Growth Along the Benadir Coast of Southern Somalia |year=1996 |publisher=Uppsala University |page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJsSAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA33 |volume=12 |series=Studies in African archaeology |issn=0284-5040 |isbn=9789150611236 |access-date=28 September 2023 |archive-date=28 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230928111614/https://books.google.com/books?id=AJsSAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA33 |url-status=live }}</ref> It has now been widely accepted that there were already communities on the Somali coast with ethnic Somali leadership, to whom the Arab and Persian families had to ask for permission to settle in their cities.

Mogadishu along with [[Zeila]] and other Somali coastal cities was founded upon an indigenous network involving hinterland trade and that happened even before significant Arab migrations or trade with the Somali coast. That goes back approximately four thousand years and are supported by archaeological and textual evidences.<ref>{{Cite book|series=University College London Institute of Archaeology Publications|last=Mire|first=Sada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J6nODwAAQBAJ&pg=PA129|title=Divine Fertility: The Continuity in Transformation of an Ideology of Sacred Kinship in Northeast Africa|date=2020|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-429-76924-5|page=129|access-date=6 June 2023|archive-date=6 June 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230606063336/https://books.google.com/books?id=J6nODwAAQBAJ&pg=PA129|url-status=live}}</ref>

This is corroborated by the first century AD Greek document the [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]], detailing multiple prosperous port cities in ancient Somalia, as well as the identification of ancient [[Sarapion]] with the city that would later be known as Mogadishu.<ref>Making Sense of Somali History: Volume 1 – Page 48</ref> When [[Ibn Battuta]] visited the Sultanate in the 14th century, he identified the Sultan as being of [[Barbaria (East Africa)|Barbara]] origin,<ref>The Travels of Ibn Battuta, A.D. 1325–1354: Volume II Page 375</ref> an ancient term to describe the ancestors of the [[Somali people]].

[[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], a Muslim medieval geographer in the year 1220 describes Mogadishu as the most prominent town on the coast.

According to the 16th-century explorer, [[Leo Africanus]] indicates that the native inhabitants of the Mogadishu polity were of the same origins as the denizens of the northern people of [[Zeila]] the capital of [[Adal Sultanate]]. They were generally tall with an olive skin complexion, some darker. They would wear traditional rich white silk wrapped around their bodies and have Islamic turbans, and coastal people only wore sarongs and wrote in [[Arabic]] as a [[lingua franca]]. Their weaponry consisted of traditional Somali weapons such as [[sword]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[spear]]s, [[battle axe]], and [[bow and arrow]]s. However, they received assistance from its close ally, the [[Ottoman Empire]], and with the import of firearms such as [[musket]]s and [[cannon]]s. Most were Muslims, although a few adhered to [[Waaq|pre-Islamic beliefs]]; there were also some [[Orthodox Tewahedo|Orthodox Tewahedo Christians]] further inland. Mogadishu itself was a wealthy, and well-built city-state, which maintained commercial trade with kingdoms across the world.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Njoku |first=Raphael Chijioke |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FlL2vE_qRQ8C&q=portuguese+mogadishu&pg=PA39 |title=The History of Somalia |date=2013 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-313-37857-7 |language=en |access-date=6 November 2020 |archive-date=22 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240522143208/https://books.google.com/books?id=FlL2vE_qRQ8C&q=portuguese+mogadishu&pg=PA39 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[metropolis]] city was surrounded by walled stone fortifications.<ref name="Leo Africanus source">{{cite web |last=(Africanus) |first=Leo |date=6 April 1969 |title=A Geographical Historie of Africa |url=https://archive.org/stream/historyanddescr03porygoog#page/n180/mode/2up |access-date=6 April 2018 |publisher=Theatrum Orbis Terrarum |via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Dunn |first=Ross E. |url=https://archive.org/details/adventuresofibnb00ross_0 |title=The Adventures of Ibn Battuta |publisher=[[University of California]] |year=1987 |isbn=978-0-520-05771-5 |location=Berkeley |page=373 |url-access=registration}}, p. 125</ref>

The [[Ajuran Sultanate]] collapsed in the 17th century due to heavy taxation against their subjects, which started a rebellion. The ex-subjects became a new wave of Somali migrants, the [[Abgaal]], moved both into the [[Shebelle River]] basin and Mogadishu. A new political elite led by [[Abgaal]] Yaquub [[imam]]s, with ties to the new leaders in the interior, moved into the [[Shangani District]] of the city. Remnants of the [[Ajuran (clan)|Ajuran]] lived in the other key-quarters of [[Hamar Weyne District]]. Ajuran merchants began to look for new linkages and regional trade opportunities since the Abgaal had commandeered the existing trading networks.<ref>Enrico, Cerulli, How a Hawiye tribe used to live, Chapter 4, scritti vari editi ed inediti, Vol. 2, edited by Enrico Cerulli, Roma</ref><ref>Lee V.

===Early Modern period (1700s–1900s)===
==== Hiraab Imamate ====
By the 17th century, the [[Hiraab Imamate]] was a powerful kingdom that ruled large parts of southern and central Somalia. It successfully revolted against the [[Ajuran Sultanate]] and established an independent rule for at least two centuries from the seventeen hundreds and onwards.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X1dDDwAAQBAJ&q=%22hiraab+imamate%22&pg=PA62 |title=Making Sense of Somali History: Volume 1 |isbn=9781909112797 |last1=Abdullahi |first1=Abdurahman |date=18 September 2017 |publisher=Adonis and Abbey Publishers |access-date=6 November 2020 |archive-date=19 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201119224403/https://books.google.com/books?id=X1dDDwAAQBAJ&q=%22hiraab+imamate%22&pg=PA62 |url-status=live }}</ref>

By the late 19th century, the Imamate began to decline due to internal problems, the Imamate also faced challenges from Imperialist kingdoms, the Zanzibari Sultan from the coast and [[Geledi Sultanate]], and [[Hobyo Sultanate]] from the interior from both directions.<ref name="Lee V. Cassanelli 1982">Lee V. Cassanelli, The shaping of Somali society., Philadelphia, 1982,</ref>

==== Geledi Sultanate ====

The [[Sultanate of Geledi]] and the [[Omani Empire]] vied over who would be the superior power on the Benadir Coast, with Sultan [[Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim|Yusuf Mahamud]] ultimately being the dominant force with the Omanis having a nominal presence and [[Said bin Sultan]] even paying tribute to him in order to keep [[Oman|Omani]] representatives in Mogadishu.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of African History, Volume 2 |page=990 |year=2005 |first=Kevin |last=Shillington |isbn=9781579584542 |publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn}}</ref> Mogadishu under [[Abgaal]] control had been in a period of decline and disarray near the end of the [[Hiraab Imamate]].

Despite the Somali political decline, trade with [[Geledi Sultanate]] flourished during Geledi Sultan [[Ahmed Yusuf (Gobroon)|Ahmed Yusuf]]'s reign. British explorer [[John Kirk (explorer)|John Kirk]] visited the region in 1873 and noted a variety of things. Roughly 20 large dhows were docked in both Mogadishu and [[Merka]] filled with grain produced from the farms of the Geledi in the interior. Kirk met the Imam Mahmood who reigned over Mogadishu. The [[Shabelle]] river itself was referred to as the 'Geledi river' by Kirk, perhaps in respect of the volume of produce that the Sultanate output. In [[Barawa]] there was little grain instead a large quantity of ivory and skins which had already been loaded onto ships destined for [[Zanzibar]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society of London, Volume 17; Volumes 1872–1873 |date=1873 |first=John |last=Kirk |page=341 |publisher=Edward Stanford}}</ref>

The Geledi Sultans were at the height of their power.

===Italian Somaliland (late 1800s–1960)===
[[File:Group portrait of Somali officials, c.1939.jpg|thumb|258x258px|A group of senior [[Somali people|Somali]] officials recently returned from [[Italy]] in Mogadishu, 1939.]]
In 1905, Italy made Mogadishu the capital of the newly established [[Italian Somaliland]]. The Italians subsequently spelled the name of the city as ''Mogadiscio''. After [[World War I]], the surrounding territory came under Italian control with some resistance.{{sfn|Hamilton|2007|p=28}}

Thousands of Italians and other people from the Italian empire began to settle in Mogadishu and founded small manufacturing companies across Somalia. They also developed some agricultural areas in the south near the capital, such as [[Janale]] and the ''Villaggio duca degli Abruzzi'' (present-day [[Jowhar]]).{{sfn|Bevilacqua|Clementi|Franzina|2001|p=233}} In the 1930s, new buildings and avenues were built. A {{cvt|114|km}} narrow-gauge railway was laid from Mogadishu to Jowhar. An asphalt road, the ''Strada Imperiale'', was also constructed and intended to link Mogadishu to [[Addis Ababa]].{{sfn|Eichstaedt|2010|p=41}}

In 1940, the [[Italian Somalis|Italo-Somali]] population numbered 22,000, accounting for over 44% of the city's population of 50,000 residents.<ref>{{cite web |last=Termentin |first=Fernando |title=Somalia, una nazione che non esiste |url=http://www.paginedidifesa.it/2005/termentini_050513.html |publisher=Pagine di Difesa |access-date=2 January 2014 |language=it |date=13 May 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105003933/http://www.paginedidifesa.it/2005/termentini_050513.html |archive-date=5 November 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Il Razionalismo nelle colonie italiane 1928–1943 – La "nuova architettura" delle Terre d'Oltremare |url=http://www.fedoa.unina.it/1881/1/Santoianni_Progettazione_Architettonica.pdf |publisher=Fedoa |access-date=2 January 2014 |archive-date=24 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924011622/http://www.fedoa.unina.it/1881/1/Santoianni_Progettazione_Architettonica.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Mogadishu remained the capital of Italian Somaliland throughout the latter polity's existence. In [[World War II]] it was captured by British forces in February 1941.

After World War II Mogadishu was made the capital of the [[Trust Territory of Somaliland]], an Italian administered fiduciary political entity under the [[United Nations|UNO]] mandate, for ten years (1950–1960).

===Somali Republic (1960–1991)===
{{Main|Somali Republic|Somali Democratic Republic}}
[[File:Mogadishu city centre - 1960s.jpg|thumb|left|Mogadishu Avenue, 1963]]
[[British Somaliland]] became independent on 26 June 1960 as the [[State of Somaliland]], and the [[Trust Territory of Somalia]] (the former Italian Somaliland) followed suit five days later.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2002|p=835}} On 1 July 1960, the two territories united to form the Somali Republic, with Mogadishu serving as the nation's capital. A government was formed by [[Abdullahi Issa]] and other members of the trusteeship and protectorate governments, with [[Haji Bashir Ismail Yusuf]] as President of the Somali National Assembly, [[Aden Abdullah Osman Daar]] as [[List of Presidents of Somalia|President]] of the [[Somali Republic]], and [[Abdirashid Ali Shermarke]] as [[Prime Minister of Somalia|Prime Minister]] (later to become president from 1967 to 1969). On 20 July 1961 and through a popular [[referendum]], the people of Somalia ratified a new [[constitution]], which was first drafted in 1960.{{sfn|Greystone|1967|p=338}} In 1967, [[Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal]] became Prime Minister, a position to which he was appointed by Shermarke.

On 15 October 1969, while paying a visit to the northern town of [[Las Anod]], Somalia's then President Abdirashid Ali Shermarke was assassinated by one of his own bodyguards. His assassination was quickly followed by a military [[coup d'état]] on 21 October 1969 (the day after his funeral), in which the [[Military of Somalia|Somali Army]] seized power without encountering armed opposition&nbsp;— essentially a bloodless takeover. The [[1969 Somali coup d'état|putsch]] was spearheaded by Major General [[Siad Barre|Mohamed Siad Barre]], who at the time commanded the army.{{sfn|Sachs|1988|p=290}}
[[File:Mogadishu.jpg|thumb|right|Metropolitan Mogadishu in the 1980s]]
Alongside Barre, the [[Supreme Revolutionary Council (Somalia)|Supreme Revolutionary Council]] (SRC) that assumed power after President Sharmarke's assassination was led by Lieutenant Colonel [[Salaad Gabeyre Kediye]] and Chief of Police [[Jama Ali Korshel]].

The revolutionary army established large-scale public works programmes, including the [[Mogadishu Stadium]]. In addition to a [[nationalization]] programme of industry and land, the Mogadishu-based new regime's foreign policy placed an emphasis on Somalia's traditional and religious links with the [[Arab world]], eventually joining the [[Arab League]] in 1974.{{sfn|Frankel|1992|p=306}}

===Civil war===
{{Main|Mogadishu riots of July 1989|Somali Civil War}}

By the late 1980s, Barre's regime had become increasingly unpopular. The authorities became ever more [[totalitarian]], and [[resistance movement]]s, encouraged by Ethiopia's [[communist]] [[Derg]] administration, sprang up across the country. Mogadishu saw its first major outbreak of violence during the [[Mogadishu riots of July 1989|14 July 1989 riots]],<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal |date=19 Jul 1989 |title=Military Imposes 'Terror' in Capital |journal=Daily Report: Sub-Saharan Africa |publisher=[[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]] |volume=89 |issue=138 |pages=6}}</ref> during the crackdown Barres forces killed approximately 400 civilians.''<ref name=":2">{{Cite news |last=Ap |date=22 July 1989 |title=SOMALIA EXECUTES 46 AFTER RIOTING |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/22/world/somalia-executes-46-after-rioting.html |access-date=2022-12-31 |issn=0362-4331 |archive-date=23 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230723150348/https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/22/world/somalia-executes-46-after-rioting.html |url-status=live }}</ref>'' The July 1989 riots resulted in a large exodus of foreigners from the city and intensification of opposition towards the regime.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal |date=18 July 1989 |title=Envoy to London Cited on Unrest in Mogadishu |journal=Daily Report: Sub-Saharan Africa |publisher=[[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]] |volume=89 |issue=143}}</ref> This incident and other events over the following months led to the outbreak of the [[civil war]] in 1991, the toppling of Barre's government, and the disbandment of the [[Military of Somalia|Somali National Army]].

In 2006, the [[Islamic Courts Union]] (ICU), an [[Islamism|Islamist]] organization, assumed control of much of the southern part of the country and imposed [[sharia]] law. The new [[Transitional Federal Government]] (TFG), established two years earlier, sought to establish its authority.

Following this defeat, the Islamic Courts Union splintered into factions. Some of the more radical elements, including a youth milita within the courts military wing known as [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]], regrouped to continue their [[insurgency]] against the TFG and oppose the [[Ethiopian National Defense Force|Ethiopian military]]'s presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured [[Baidoa]] but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, al-Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to retreat, leaving behind an under-equipped African Union peacekeeping force to assist the Transitional Federal Government's troops.<ref>{{cite web |author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,USCIRF,,,4a4f272bc,0.html |title=USCIRF Annual Report 2009&nbsp;– The Commission's Watch List: Somalia |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=1 May 2009 |access-date=27 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510005900/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher%2CUSCIRF%2C%2C%2C4a4f272bc%2C0.html |archive-date=10 May 2011}}</ref>

In October 2013, major construction began on the 23-kilometer road leading to the airport. Overseen by Somali and Turkish engineers, the upgrade was completed in November and included lane demarcation. The road construction initiative was part of a larger agreement signed by the Somali and Turkish governments to establish Mogadishu and Istanbul as sister cities, and in the process bring all of Mogadishu's roads up to modern standards.<ref name="Smrgmnug">{{cite news |last=Jibril |first=Dahir |title=Mogadishu roads get much needed upgrades |url=http://sabahionline.com/en_GB/articles/hoa/articles/features/2013/10/03/feature-02 |access-date=24 January 2014 |newspaper=Sabahi |date=3 October 2013 |archive-date=4 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204012355/http://sabahionline.com/en_GB/articles/hoa/articles/features/2013/10/03/feature-02 |url-status=live }}</ref> Following the treaty, the [[Turkish International Cooperation and Development Agency]] (TIKA) launched a citywide cleaning project in conjunction with the municipal cleaning department.

[[Minibus]]es are the most common type of [[public transportation]] in Mogadishu. The next most frequently used public vehicles in the city are [[auto rickshaw]]s (''bajaj''). They number around 3,000 units and come in various designs. The auto-rickshaws represent a lower cost alternative to taxis and minibuses, typically charging half the price for the same distance, with flexible rates. Due to their affordability, capacity to negotiate narrow lanes and low fuel consumption, the three-wheeled vehicles are often appealing investment opportunities for small-scale entrepreneurs. They are generally preferred for shorter commutes.<ref name="Gartptim">{{cite news |title=Auto-rickshaws transform public transport in Mogadishu |url=http://goobjoog.com/english/?p=11867 |access-date=17 March 2015 |agency=Goobjoog |date=17 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402201213/http://goobjoog.com/english/?p=11867 |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In June 2013, two new taxi companies also started offering road transportation to residents.
