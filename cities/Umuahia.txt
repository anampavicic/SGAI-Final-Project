'''Umuahia''' ({{IPA|ig|ʊmʊaːhiaː|pron}}) is the capital city of [[Abia State]] in southeastern [[Nigeria]].<ref  name="vgmedia">{{cite news|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/10/gate-umuahia/| title=The 'Gate' of Umuahia| date=2013-10-01|work=[[Vanguard (Nigeria)|Vanguardngr.com]]| publisher=[[Vanguard Media]]|access-date=2014-03-30}}</ref><ref name="GPS">{{cite news|url=http://thegpscoordinates.net/nigeria/umuahia|title=The latitude and longitude gps coordinates of Umuahia (Nigeria)|publisher=The GPS Coordinates.net|access-date=2014-03-30}}</ref><ref name="USAafricaonline news">{{cite news|url=http://www.usafricaonline.com/abia.html|title=ABIA State of Nigeria |publisher=USAfricaonline.com|access-date=2014-03-30}}</ref> Umuahia is located along the rail road that lies between [[Port Harcourt]] to its south, and [[Enugu]] city to its north. Umuahia has a population of 359,230 according to the 2006 Nigerian census.

Umuahia is renowned for being a railway and [[Agricultural marketing|agricultural market]] center, which attracts traders and farmers from neighboring towns to sell their produce, such as yams, cassava, corn (maize), taro, citrus fruits, and [[palm oil]] and kernels.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Umuahia {{!}} Location, Facts, & Population {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Umuahia |access-date=2022-07-19 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> There are industries that help drive its economy, such as a brewery and a palm-oil-processing plant. Nigeria's [[National Root Crops Research Institute]], at [[Umudike]], is adjacent to the town. Umuahia also has several colleges including Trinity College (theological), Government College Umuahia, Holy Rosary Girls Secondary School and hospitals like the [[Federal Medical Centre, Umuahia|Federal Medical Centre]], Umuahia (formerly Queen Elizabeth Hospital).<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Nwankwo |first1=I.

Umuahia comprises two [[Local Government Areas of Nigeria|local government areas]]: [[Umuahia North]] and [[Umuahia South]]. These local governments are also composed of clans such as the [[Umuopara]], [[Ibeku]], [[Olokoro]], [[Ubakala]] and [[Ohuhu]] communities.<ref name = "reference D">Asiegbu, Johnson U. J.(1985).

Pg.95-105. https://idl-bnc-idrc.dspacedirect.org/bitstream/handle/10625/1741/IDL-1741.pdf</ref>

==History==
According to popular legend, the name Umuahia derives from the Igbo word ''AmaAhia''<ref>[http://www.google.com Oma]</ref> or "Ama Ahia", which means "market place or market center", respectively. The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]], who arrived the region and [[Annexation|annexed]] it sometime around the mid-to late 19th century, upon learning the name, mistakenly pronounced and spelled it as "Umuahia". Other legends exist regarding the origin of Umuahia, but the foregoing version seems most probable by consensus.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Amadi, C. O and Edighan, B. I|date=June 2017|title=Analysis Of Traffic Volume And Parking At Ishi -Gate, Umuahia, Abia State, Nigeria|url=https://www.ijiras.com/2017/Vol_4-Issue_6/paper_74.pdf|journal=International Journal of Innovative Research and Advanced Studies (IJIRAS)|volume=4|issue=6|pages=1–20|via=IJIRAS}}</ref> In precolonial times, it served as one of the central marketplaces in the region for commerce. Given its serenity and proximity to other towns, such as Ohafia, Abiriba, Ihechiowa, Arochukwu, Obowo, Ngwa, Okigwi, Uzuakoli, Bende, Nnewi, Akwa Akpa (Old Calabar), and Kalabari, merchants of produce, pottery, crafts, textile, traditional medicine, palm wine, and tools travelled from afar, to trade at the busy market center, with many roads leading to it.<ref name=":2" />

However, the name Ama Ahia was not the town's name; rather it was located in a place called Afor Ibeji, near Olokoro Town. With increasing British administrative and commercial activities in the region and yonder, Umuahia, as it came to be known and written, was relocated to Ibeku Town for better oversight by administrative offices and the convergence of roads at Ibeku.  The new location became one of the major trading posts along the rail route built by the [[Royal Niger Company|United African Company]] (UAC) for carting produce, raw materials, and minerals along the trade route from Sub-Sahara to the Atlantic Ocean, for onward exportation to Europe. The [[trading post]] was named Umuahia-Ibeku Station to reflect the new market square and domain. Over time, the area became known as Umuahia, while the original market town at Afor Ibeji was renamed to Old Umuahia. The hyphenated Umuahia-Ibeku became a source of dispute, given that neighboring towns such as Ohuhu, Umuopara, Afugiri, Ofeme, etc., were constituted into the Umuahia administrative area, entitling them to be under Umuahia, not Umuahia – Ibeku, since Ibeku is on the same level as the constituent parts of Umuahia.

Umuahia, though comprising several villages and communities, is composed mainly of five sister clans, socially and phonologically homogenous at most, with each clan having its own version of autonomy, and social evolution.

Umuahia was established by the [[Colonial Nigeria|British colonial administration of Nigeria]] in the early 20th century. Umuahia was declared the second (and soon became the longest serving) capital, of the short-lived nation of the [[Republic of Biafra]], on 28 September 1967 after the first capital, [[Enugu]] was captured by Nigerian troops. On April 22, 1969 Umuahia was occupied and nearly taken by Nigerian troops but were forced to retreat, due to a stiff offensive by Biafran Maj. E.A. Eutuk. After Umuahia's capture on 24 December 1969, the last Biafran capital before its dissolution became [[Owerri]].

Formerly known as Ikwuano/Umuahia Local government council until the Babangida-led government divided it into two LGAs—Ikwuano  LGA and Umuahia LGA in 1991—and then later in 1996, the former Umuahia Local Government Area was split by Abacha-led government into two local governments: Umuahia North and Umuahia South. The first executive chairman of the old Umuahia local government area is Chief Chibiko Ukanwoke, elected in December 1991.

== Government ==

=== Umuahia Local Government Areas (LGAs) ===
There are two LGAs in Umuahia, namely; Umuahia North and Umuahia South. Both LGAs are made up of Clans, and villages in turn, made up the Clans.

The South has three major clans, namely – Ubakala, Olokoro,  and [[Umuopara]] (until 1949, Umuopara was part of Ohuhu). Some of the communities/villages in Umuahia South constitute what is known as Old Umuahia. The Local Government council Headquarters is located at Apumiri in [[Ubakala]].

The North consists of Ibeku and [[Ohuhu]]. Its Local Government council Headquarters is located at [[Ibeku]].
