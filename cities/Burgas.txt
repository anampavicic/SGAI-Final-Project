It is the capital of [[Burgas Province]] and an important industrial, transport, cultural and tourist centre.

The city is surrounded by the [[Burgas Lakes]] and located at the westernmost point of the [[Black Sea]], at the large [[Burgas Bay]]. [[LUKOIL Neftochim Burgas]] is the largest [[oil refinery]] in southeastern Europe and the largest industrial enterprise. The [[Port of Burgas]] is the largest port in Bulgaria, and [[Burgas Airport]] is the second most important in the country. Burgas is the centre of the Bulgarian fishing and fish processing industry.<ref name="USNI">Norman Polmar: ''The Naval Institute guide to the Soviet Navy'', 5.

== Names ==
[[File:Burgas Bulgaria by Sentinel-2 20190831.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Burgas as seen from space]]
The city's name has a similar literal composition as [[Burgos]] in Spain, as well as numerous cities containing the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[burg (disambiguation)|burg]], meaning "city,"
such as [[Hamburg]].
It is widely considered, including by the city's official website, that the name of the city is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word "''burgus''", meaning a "tower", after a local ancient Roman travel post, which used to be in the area of today's Burgas Port. Fifteen  centuries later, the settlement was mentioned by the Byzantine poet [[Manuel Philes]] as "''Pyrgos''" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Πύργος), a word identical in meaning with the Greek word for tower.<ref name=municipality>{{cite web|url=http://www.burgas.bg/en/info/index/91|title=Burgas Municipality|publisher=Burgas|access-date=23 Jul 2015|archive-date=21 Jul 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721122541/http://www.burgas.bg/en/info/index/91|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=pocket>{{cite web |url=http://www.inyourpocket.com/Burgas/History |title=Burgas |access-date=23 Jul 2015 |archive-date=24 Jul 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724021856/http://www.inyourpocket.com/Burgas/History |url-status=live }}</ref> The name passed to Bulgarian through the Turkish ''Burgaz''.
There are several alternative explanations for the name's origin. One of them states the city's name comes from [[Gothic language|Gothic]] name "baurgs", meaning "signified consolidated [[defensive wall|walled]] villages".<ref>Wright, Joseph, 1892, ''A Primer of the Gothic Language'', glossary & section 182.</ref> According to Bulgarian prof. Kiril Vlahov, the name of the city comes from the [[Thracian language|Thracian]] word "''pyurg''", meaning "fortification of wooden beams".

==Geography==

=== Topography ===
Burgas is situated at the westernmost point of the bay by the same name and in the eastern part of the [[Burgas Plain]], in the east of the [[Upper Thracian Plain]]. Burgas is located some {{convert|360|km|mi|0}} from Sofia, {{convert|255|km|0|abbr=on}} from Plovdiv, {{convert|130|km|0|abbr=on}} from Varna, and {{convert|abbr=on|332|km|mi|0}} from [[Istanbul]]. To the west, south and north, the city is surrounded by the [[Burgas Lakes]]: [[Lake Burgas|Burgas]], [[Lake Atanasovsko|Atanasovsko]], and [[Lake Mandrensko|Mandrensko]], which are home to several hundred bird species. [[Pan-European corridors|Pan-European corridor 8]] passes through the city,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unece.org/page404/trans%20main%20ter%20Countries%20PanEuCorridors|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223194354/http://www.unece.org/trans/main/ter/Countries/PanEuCorridors.html|url-status=dead|title=UNECE|archive-date=23 February 2011|website=unece.org}}</ref> the [[European route E87|European routes E87]] and [[European route E773|E773]], and the longest national rout I/6.

The [[St. Anastasia Island]] is a part of the city.

===Climate===
<!-- Note: Burgas has a humid subtropical climate according to the Köppen climate classification. Burgas does not have a Mediterranean climate because the average annual precipitation is evenly distributed, with no dry season, which is the requirement for a humid subtropical climate. Whereas the requirement of a Mediterranean climate is a dry summer, which Burgas does not have. Do not change this, otherwise it will be reverted. -->

=== Flora and fauna ===
[[File:Uzungeren.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Usungeren Protected Area]]]]
[[File:Lake-mandrensko-dinev.jpg|thumb|upright| [[Lake Mandrensko]]]]

The [[Burgas Wetlands]] are highly recognized for their significance to biodiversity and as a resource pool for products used by people.

Lake Burgas is Bulgaria's largest lake and is in the middle of the city. It is important for migrating birds. Over 250 species of birds inhabit the lake area, 61 of which are endangered in Bulgaria and 9 globally, attracting keen birdwatchers from all over the world. The lakes are also home to important fish and [[invertebrate]]s. In the site have been recorded several [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red-Listed]] species of animals – 5 invertebrates, 4 fish, 4 [[amphibian]]s, 3 [[reptiles]], 5 birds and 3 [[mammal]]s. Situated along the second largest migration path of birds in Europe, the [[Via Pontica]], the site is an important stopover and staging site for a large number of water-birds, raptors and passerines. Yearly during migration and wintering more than 20,000 (up to 100,000) waterbirds congregate there.<ref name="Ramsar Convention">{{cite web |url=http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-pubs-annolist-anno-bulgaria/main/ramsar/1-30-168%5E16696_4000_0__ |title=Ramsar Convention |publisher=Ramsar.org |access-date=2012-06-07 |archive-date=19 Oct 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019073435/http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-pubs-annolist-anno-bulgaria/main/ramsar/1-30-168%5E16696_4000_0__ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Atanasovo Lake is one of two salt-water lakes in the Black Sea region and contains rare and representative examples of wetland habitats. It is a hot spot for biodiversity, with many Red-Listed species of plants and animals. It is a well-known bottleneck site for migratory birds, with around 60,000 raptors and 240,000 storks, pelicans and cranes passing over the site and often landing in large numbers for staging. The highest numbers in Europe of migrating [[Great white pelican]] (''Pelecanus onocrotalus''), [[Dalmatian pelican]] (''Pelecanus crispus''), [[Western marsh harrier]] (''Circus aeruginosus'') and [[Red-footed Falcon]] (''Falco vespertinus'') have been recorded here.<ref name="Ramsar Convention"/>

With a decision from the Counsel of Ministers in 2009, the villages of [[Banevo]] and [[Vetren, Burgas|Vetren]] were incorporated into Burgas.

Currently a new city plan is being considered which will open the city to the sea and includes several residential neighbourhoods and a new highway junction.

==History==
[[File:Bronze-Alexander Severus-Deultum AE25 Moushmov 3583.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Alexander Severus]] coin from the ''Colonia Flavia Pacis Deultensium'']]
The earliest signs of life in the region date back 3000 years, to the [[Bronze Age]] and the early [[Iron Age]]. The favorable conditions on the fertile plain, around the sea, have brought people here from early antiquity. The biggest mark was left by the Thracians who made the region rich in archaeological finds (from around 4th c. BC). This includes their sanctuary at [[Beglik Tash]] along the south coast and a burial mound near [[Sunny Beach]]. They built the mineral baths of [[Aquae Calidae, Bulgaria|Aquae Calidae]] and the fortress ''Tyrsis''.<ref name=municipality/><ref name=pocket/>
Under [[Darius I]] became part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], before the [[Odrysian kingdom]] was established. Greeks from [[Sozopol|Apollonia]] built a marketplace to trade with the Thracians, in what is now the neighborhood of Pobeda.

During the rule of the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]], near Burgas, [[Develtos|''Colonia Flavia Pacis Deultensium'']] (''Deultum'', ''Dibaltum'', or ''Develtum'') was established as a military colony for veterans by [[Vespasian]] in AD 70. The Romans built this ''colonia'' on the main road [[Via Pontica]]. It was the second most important city in the province [[Haemimontus]].

In 376 the Goths destroyed an elite Roman [[Company (military unit)|company]] near Develtum at the [[Battle of Dibaltum]].<ref>Herwig Wolfram: ''Die Goten: von den Anfängen bis zur Mitte des sechsten Jahrhunderts : Entwurf einer historischen Ethnographie'', Verlag C.H.Beck, 2001, S. 130</ref>

=== Bulgarian and Byzantine Middle Ages ===
In the [[Middle Ages]], there were important settlements in the area: the fortress ''Skafida'', ''Poros'', ''Rusokastron'' ([[Battle of Rusokastro]]), the Baths called Aquae Calidae and used by Byzantine, Bulgarian and Ottoman Emperors; a small fortress called ''Pyrgos'' was erected where Burgas is today and was most probably used as a watchtower. Under the [[Byzantine Empire]] it became an important city on the [[Black Sea]] coast. The Bulgarian ruler [[Krum]] built the [[Erkesiya]], a {{convert|140|km|0|abbr=on}}-long border wall from the Black Sea (near Gorno Ezerovo) to the [[Maritsa River]].

In 1206 the [[Latin Empire|Latin Emperor]] [[Henry of Flanders]] (see [[Fourth Crusade]]) destroyed Aquae Calidae, which was known as Thermopolis at this time, The baths were later rebuilt by the Byzantines and Bulgarians. Poros was mentioned in a 1270 document of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.<ref name="IW6065">Ivan Karayotov, Stoyan Raychevski, Mitko Ivanov: ''История на Бургас. От древността до средата на ХХ век.'', Tafprint OOD, Plovdiv, 2011, {{ISBN|978-954-92689-1-1}}, S. 60–65</ref> Close to Poros took place the [[Battle of Skafida]] in 1304, when the Bulgarian Tsar [[Theodore Svetoslav of Bulgaria|Todor Svetoslav]] defeated the Byzantines and conquered the southern Black Sea coast.

At the beginning of the 14th century the region was sacked by the [[Catalan Company]]. In the 13th century Burgas is mentioned by the Byzantine poet [[Manuel Philes]] in his works as ''Burgas''.<ref name="IW6065"/>

=== Ottoman rule ===
[[File:Illustration from Views in the Ottoman Dominions by Luigi Mayer, digitally enhanced by rawpixel-com 12.jpg|thumb|Burgas in [[Ottoman Bulgaria]], painted by [[Luigi Mayer]]]]
Like many of the towns surrounding it, Burgas was conquered by the Ottomans with the rest of Bulgaria in the late 14th century, only to be [[Treaty of Gallipoli|returned]] to the Byzantine Empire during the [[Ottoman Interregnum]] and retained by the Byzantines until the fall of the Empire to the Ottomans in 1453. It was only in the 17th century that a settlement renamed to ''Ahelo-Pirgas'' grew in the modern area of the city. It was later renamed to ''Burgas'' again and had only about 3,000 inhabitants. In the early 19th century Burgas was depopulated after raids by ''kurzdhali'' bandits. By the mid-19th century it had recovered its economic prominence through the growth of craftsmanship and the export of grain.<ref>''Burgas'', ''Bulgaria (Eyewitness Travel)'', Jonathan Bousfield and Matt Willis, Dorling Kindersley Limited, [[London, England]], 2008, p. 210.</ref> The city was a small town in [[Sliven|İslimye]] (Sliven) sanjak in at first [[Rumelia Eyalet]], after that in the [[Silistra Eyalet]] and [[Edirne Eyalet]] before the liberation in 1878.

In the 17th and 18th centuries Burgas became an important port for [[cereal]] and possesses its own grain measure, the ''Burgas-Kile''. The town was the regional centre of trade and administrative centre of the Burgas Kaaza.<ref>''Etudes historiques.

Bulg. des sciences, 1970, p. 243 and p. 252.</ref><ref>Claude Charles De Peyssonnel: ''Traité sur le commerce de la Mer Noire'', Band 2, Cuchet, 1787, p. 151</ref><ref>Karayotov/Raychevski/Ivanov, p. 301</ref>

In 1865 the port of Burgas was after [[Trabzon|Trapezunt]] the second most important Ottoman port in the Black Sea. Burgas was at this time the major centre on the southern [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast]].<ref>Karayotov/Raychevski/Ivanov, p. 112–113</ref><ref>Wael B.

=== From liberation to 1945 ===
[[File:Burgas-alexandrovska-street-1906.jpg|thumb|left|Alexandrovska Street in 1906]]
It was a department centre in [[Eastern Rumelia]] before incorporated in the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] in 1885.
From the late 19th century Burgas became an important economic and industry center.

After the end of the Second World War, the [[Haganah]] organised several convoys for the European survivors of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], which departed on ships from Burgas for Palestine. These convoys allowed 12,000 people, including the Jewish population of the city, to emigrate.<ref>Gaby Coldewey: ''Zwischen Pruth und Jordan: Lebenserinnerungen Czernowitzer Juden.''

A number of oil and chemical companies were gradually built.

The terrorists of the [[2 June Movement]], Till Meyer, [[Gabriele Rollnik]], Gudrun Stürmer and Angelika Goder were arrested on 21 June 1978 in Burgas by West German officials and then brought into the [[Federal Republic of Germany|Federal Republic]].<ref>Eckhart Dietrich: ''Angriffe auf den Rechtsstaat: die Baader/Meinhof-Bande, die Bewegung 2.
