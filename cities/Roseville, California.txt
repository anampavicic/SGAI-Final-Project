'''Roseville''' is the most populous city in [[Placer County, California]], located within the [[Sacramento metropolitan area]]. As of 2019, the [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]] estimated the city's population to be 141,500, making it the third-largest city in the Sacramento area.<ref name="USCensusEst2019">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2019.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|access-date=May 21, 2020}}</ref> [[Interstate 80 in California|Interstate 80]] runs through Roseville and [[California State Route 65|State Route 65]] runs through part of the northern edge of the city.

Historically associated with the railroad, the city underwent significant [[urban renewal]] in the 1980s and 1990s. Today it has become a major commercial hub, attracting regular shoppers and visitors from a large swath of rural southeastern [[Sacramento Valley]] and the Sierra Nevada foothills. In recent years, it has seen significant population growth and new single-family home developments, becoming a “[[boomburb]]” or [[edge city]] of Sacramento.

==History==
The [[Nisenan]] lived in the land that became Roseville for over 2000 years before being forcibly removed by disease, miners and settlers. The settlement developed around a stage coach station called Griders.<ref name=CGN>{{California's Geographic Names|548}}</ref> According to the Roseville Historical Society,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rosevillehistorical.org/about.html |title=Archived copy: History of Roseville |access-date=June 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517160848/http://www.rosevillehistorical.org/about.html |archive-date=May 17, 2014 |url-status=dead |quote=In 1864, a track-laying crew from the Central Pacific Railroad came eastward across the plain from Sacramento, building the western half of the nation's first transcontinental railroad. They crossed a small rail line (the California Central Railroad) that linked the young towns of Lincoln and Folsom, and gave the spot the imaginative name of Junction.}}</ref> in 1864 the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] tracks were constructed northeastward from Sacramento as part of the transcontinental railroad. The point where the tracks met the [[California Central Railroad]] line was named "Junction".<ref name=CGN/> Junction eventually became known as Roseville.

In 1909, three years after the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] moved its facilities from [[Rocklin, California|Rocklin]] to Roseville, the town became an [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] city. What followed was a period of expansion, with businesses building more than 100 structures, including what was the largest ice manufacturing plant in the world (the Pacific Fruit Express building) in 1913.

The city was a railroad town for decades. By 1929, the railroad employed up to 1,225 people out of a total population of 6,425.<ref>{{Cite web|date=March 2, 2013|title=City of Roseville, California - 1920s|url=http://www.roseville.ca.us/visiting/history_of_roseville/1920s.asp|access-date=August 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302054248/http://www.roseville.ca.us/visiting/history_of_roseville/1920s.asp|archive-date=March 2, 2013}}</ref> With the onset of World War II, the rail yards became busier than ever.

The post-war building boom brought continued prosperity. But the nature of the city changed dramatically in the 1950s.

During this decade, the railroad continued to expand and upgrade, converting its [[steam engine]] fleet to all [[diesel engine]]s. But competition arose in new sectors: the postwar development of the national [[Interstate Highway System]] and the airline industry adversely affected the railroads' passenger and freight traffic. Trucking carried increasing amount of freight on highways. Industry restructuring took place and jobs were lost as railroads dropped passenger routes and consolidated operations.

Although the railroad has continued as a major employer in Roseville, the city's expansion has been based on the emergence of other employment sectors.

Construction in 1950 of the Washington Boulevard (then called Seawell) railroad underpass dramatically affected downtown. It improved the ability of people to travel from one side of the tracks to the other, but it reduced traffic through the Roseville business district north of the tracks. Those businesses lost customers.

The completion of Interstate 80 in 1956 stimulated new businesses, with a population shift, from downtown to what would become known as East Roseville. The old downtown lost more businesses and slid into a gradual decline.

The Southern Pacific (now Union Pacific) yard was the site of the [[1973 Roseville Yard Disaster]]. A major explosion and fire took place.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.safetycenter.navy.mil/media/ashore/issues/spring01/Roseville.htm |title=The Roseville Explosion-- |access-date=June 28, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723050407/http://www.safetycenter.navy.mil/media/ashore/issues/spring01/Roseville.htm |archive-date=July 23, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The city saw steady population growth throughout the ensuing decades, as shopping centers, major retailers, and homes were constructed, mostly outside the historic downtown. The growth rate was modest until 1985. Between 1929, when the population was 6,425 people, and 1985, the population grew by 22,563 people.

In 1985 the population stood at 28,988 people. Five years later it was 44,685 people, and by 2000 it was 74,234 people. Some of this growth was fueled by the arrival of major technology employers, such as Hewlett Packard (in 1979) and NEC (in 1983), in the city The population as of 2014 was 126,956 people.<ref>{{Cite web|date=March 8, 2010|title=City of Roseville, California - Population|url=http://www.roseville.ca.us/ed/demographics/city_demographics/population/default.asp|access-date=August 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308230211/http://www.roseville.ca.us/ed/demographics/city_demographics/population/default.asp|archive-date=March 8, 2010}}</ref>

===Revitalization===
In 1988, the city embarked on a multi-million dollar plan to redevelop approximately {{convert|207|acre|km2|1}} of land in the downtown core, and revitalize historic areas that had been in decline.<ref>''Environmental Impact Report for the Roseville Redevelopment Project'', Earth Metrics, prepared for City of Roseville and State of California Clearinghouse, May 1989</ref> Projects included the Vernon Streetscape Project, Atlantic Street Beautification, Civic Plaza Complex, Downtown Vernon Street and Historic Old Town, Historic Old Town Streetscape project, Riverside Avenue Streetscape project, Oak Street Improvement Project, and Washington Boulevard pedestrian underpass.<ref>{{Cite web|date=August 1, 2012|title=City of Roseville, California - Improvement & Construction Projects|url=http://www.roseville.ca.us/communityinvestment/revitalization/improvement_n_construction_projects/default.asp|access-date=August 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801155218/http://www.roseville.ca.us/communityinvestment/revitalization/improvement_n_construction_projects/default.asp|archive-date=August 1, 2012}}</ref> A new parking garage opened in 2007, the Roseville Arts!

===Incidents===
In 1995, a Roseville police officer shot and killed another officer, Mark A. White, during an attack at the city's police station. White (in plain clothes) drew his weapon against the assailant, but another officer mistakenly believed White was also an assailant and shot and killed him.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Thigpen/Appeal-Democrat|first=Daniel|title=Officer Mark A.

On October 21, 2010, a young man set fires inside the [[Westfield Galleria at Roseville]] resulting in major damage to the mall. It reopened the next year after renovations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2011/08/23/grand-re-opening-of-roseville-galleria-set-for-october-6/|title=Grand Re-Opening Of Roseville Galleria Set For October 6|date=August 23, 2011 |work=CBS Sacramento }}</ref>

==Geography==
<!-- {{Main|Geography of Roseville, California}} -->
According to the Roseville Civic Center, the city has a total area of {{convert|42.26|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|42.24|sqmi|km2}} is land. 0.002 square miles, or {{convert|1|acre|ha}}, is water. Several streams flow through Roseville, including [[Dry Creek, Placer County|Dry Creek]], [[Linda Creek]], [[Secret Ravine]] and [[Cirby Creek]].

===Climate===
Roseville has a [[Mediterranean climate#hot-summer Mediterranean climate|hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] that is characterized by cool, wet, usually snowless winters and hot, dry summers ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa''). The climate is similar to nearby Sacramento, the minor differences reflecting Roseville's more inland position, resulting in less of the moderating influence of the ocean. As a result, winters are slightly cooler and summers are slightly hotter than Sacramento. Some marine influence does reach Roseville, so temperatures often are still more moderate than other inland parts of the Central Valley by up to {{convert|10|F-change|C-change}}.

The wet season is generally October through April. Because Roseville is east of Sacramento and at a higher elevation, it receives slightly more rainfall. The dry season lasts from June to October; similar to other Central Valley cities, temperatures can be extremely hot in the summer (routinely peaking above {{convert|105|F|C}} on the hottest days), unusual for a non-desert climate at mid-latitude. For any given year, summers can be consistently hot or mild depending on where the position of the [[North Pacific High]] settles around the end of June. Extremely hot years with July highs typically around {{convert|100|F|C}} are averaged out against milder summers that reach around {{convert|90|F|C}}.

Average daily high temperatures range from {{convert|53|F|C}} in January to {{convert|94|F|C}} in July. Daily low temperatures range from {{convert|39|F|C}} in winter to {{convert|61|F|C}} in summer.

On March 26, 2014, an [[Enhanced Fujita scale#Parameters|EF0]] tornado touched down in Roseville.<ref>{{Cite web|date=March 27, 2014|title=Roseville Tornado Strike Damages Homes|url=https://www.rosevilletoday.com/news/roseville-tornado-strike-damages-homes/|access-date=January 12, 2022|website=Roseville Today|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Medina|first=Maria|date=March 26, 2014|title=Tornado Damages Dozens Of Roseville Homes|url=https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2014/03/26/tornado-damages-dozens-of-roseville-homes/|access-date=January 12, 2022|website=CBS Sacramento|language=en-US}}</ref>
