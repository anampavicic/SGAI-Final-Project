'''Damietta''' ({{langx|ar|دمياط}} ''{{transliteration|arz|Dumyāṭ}}'' {{IPA|arz|domˈjɑːtˤ|}}; {{langx|cop|ⲧⲁⲙⲓⲁϯ|Tamiati}}) is a [[harbor|port]] city and the capital of the [[Damietta Governorate]] in [[Egypt]]. It is located at the Damietta branch, an eastern [[distributary]] of the [[Nile Delta]], {{convert|15|km|mi}} from the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and about {{Convert|200|km|mi|-1}} north of [[Cairo]]. It was a [[Catholic]] [[Diocese|bishopric]] and is a multiple [[titular see]]. It is also a member of the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities.

== Etymology ==
<div>The modern name of the city comes from its Coptic name '''Tamiati''' ({{langx|cop|ⲧⲁⲙⲓⲁϯ|}}  <small>Late Coptic:</small> {{IPA-all|dɑmˈjɑdi|}}), which in turn most likely comes from [[Ancient Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] <span style="display:inline-block">[[:wikt:dmj|<hiero>d-mi-i-N21:Z1</hiero>]]</span> ({{transliteration|egy|dmj}}, "[[mooring]], [[port]], [[town]]") and <span style="display:inline-block">[[:wikt:𓊖|<hiero>t:O49</hiero>]]</span> ({{transliteration|egy|-t}}), a determinative used for towns and cities, although [[al-Maqrizi]] suggested a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] etymology.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Peust|first=Carsten|title=Die Toponyme vorarabischen Ursprungs im modernen Ägypten|year=2010|pages=38}}</ref></div>

== History ==
Mentioned by the 6th-century geographer [[Stephanus of Byzantium]],<ref name=SV>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04615b.htm Siméon Vailhé, "Damietta" in ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York 1908)]</ref> the city was called ''Tamíathis'' ({{Lang-grc-gre|Ταμίαθις}}) in the [[Hellenistic period]].<ref name="Smith1857">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Sir William|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_NWAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA1086|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman geography|publisher=Little, Brown and Co.|year=1857|page=1086|access-date=30 May 2012}}</ref>

Under the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashid caliph]] [[Umar]] (579–644), the Arabs took the city and successfully resisted the attempts by the [[Byzantine Empire]] to recover it, especially in 739, 821, 921 and 968.<ref name=SV/> The [[Abbasid Caliphate]] used [[Alexandria]], Damietta, [[Aden]] and [[Siraf]] as entry ports to India and [[Tang dynasty|Tang China]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Donkin|first=Robin A|year=2003|title=Between East and West: The Moluccas and the Traffic in Spices Up to the Arrival of Europeans|publisher=Diane Publishing Company|isbn= 0-87169-248-1}}</ref> Damietta was an important naval base during the Abbasid, [[Tulunids|Tulunid]] and [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] periods. This led to several attacks by the [[Byzantine Empire]], most notably the [[Sack of Damietta (853)|sack and destruction]] of the city in May 853.

Damietta was again important in the 12th and 13th centuries during the [[Crusades]]. In 1169, a fleet from the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], with support from the [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Crusader invasions of Egypt#Siege of Damietta|attacked the port]], but the besiegers returned home without any success to capture the port, which was defended by [[Saladin]].<ref name="Dillon2005">{{cite book|last=Dillon|first=Charles Raymond|title=Templar Knights And the Crusades|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RmPssgauW18C&pg=PA39|access-date=30 May 2012|date=30 April 2005|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-34946-3|page=39}}</ref><ref name="Claster2009">{{cite book|last=Claster|first=Jill N.|title=Sacred Violence: The European Crusades to the Middle East, 1095-1396|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JP6OzSDQJlwC&pg=PA181|access-date=30 May 2012|date=1 October 2009|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-4426-0060-7|page=181}}</ref>

During preparations for the [[Fifth Crusade]] in 1217, it was decided that Damietta should be the focus of attack. Control of Damietta meant control of the Nile, and from there the Crusaders believed they could conquer [[Egypt]]. From Egypt, they could then attack [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]]-ruled [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and recapture [[Jerusalem]]. After the [[Siege of Damietta (1218–1219)|siege of Damietta]] of 1218–19,  the port was occupied by the Crusaders. The siege devastated the population of Damietta. After the crusaders captured Damietta in November 1219, they looted the city.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bradbury|first=Jim|title=The Medieval Siege|year=1992|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=978-0-85115-357-5|page=198}}</ref>

Damietta was also the object of the [[Seventh Crusade]], led by [[Louis IX of France]]. His fleet arrived there in 1249 and [[Siege of Damietta (1249)|quickly captured the fort]], which he refused to hand over to the nominal king of Jerusalem, to whom it had been promised during the Fifth Crusade.<ref name="Russell1837">{{cite book|last=Russell|first=William|title=The History of Modern Europe: with an Account of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire: And a View of the Progress of Society from the Rise of the Modern Kingdoms to the Peace of Paris, in 1763; in a Series of Letters from a Nobleman to His Son|url=https://archive.org/details/historymoderneu06russgoog|access-date=30 May 2012|year=1837|publisher=Longman, Rees, & Company|page=[https://archive.org/details/historymoderneu06russgoog/page/n326 280]}}</ref> However, having been taken prisoner with his army in April 1250, Louis was obliged to surrender Damietta as ransom.<ref name=SV/>

== Ecclesiastical history ==
Hellenistic Tamiathis became a Christian [[bishopric]], a [[suffragan]] of the [[metropolitan see]] of [[Pelusium]], the capital of the [[Roman province]] of [[Augustamnica Prima]], to which Tamiathis belonged. Its bishop Heraclius took part in the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431. Helpidius was a signatory of the decree of Patriarch [[Gennadius of Constantinople]] against simony in 459. Bassus was at the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] (553). In a letter from [[Patriarch Michael I of Alexandria]] read at the [[Photius|Photian]] [[Council of Constantinople (879)]], mention is made of Zacharias of Tamiathis, who had attended a synod that Michael had convened in support of [[Photius]]. Later bishops too of Tamiathis are named in other documents.<ref>Michel Lequien, [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_86weAemI-e4C ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 589-592</ref><ref>Gaetano Moroni, [https://www.yumpu.com/it/document/view/15594125/dizionario-di-erudizione-storico-ecclesiastica-72pdf-bibliotheca-/241 ''Dizionario di erudizione storico ecclesiastica'', Vol. 72 (Venice 1855), p. 236]</ref>
 
In 1249, when [[Louis IX of France]] captured the city, it became for a short time the seat of a [[Latin Church]] bishop.<ref>{{cite web |author = MESSYNESSY |title = Paris or Egypt? 100 Years Ago, It Was Hard to Tell the Difference |url = https://www.messynessychic.com/2019/03/15/paris-or-egypt-100-yeas-ago-it-was-hard-to-tell-the-difference/ |publisher = Messy Nessy Cabinet of Chic Curiosities |date = 15 March 2019 |accessdate = 22 February 2022}}</ref>
 
The Latin bishopric, no longer residential, is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] twice as a [[titular see]] under the names Tamiathis (Latin) and Damiata (Curiate Italian), each at time of episcopal or [[archiepiscopal]] rank, of the Latin and [[Melkite Catholic]] Churches,<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 879</ref> for the [[Catholic Church]], having been until the early 20th century an important centre for that church.<ref name=SV/>

== Climate ==
[[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies its climate as [[hot desert climate|hot desert]] (BWh), but blowing winds from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] greatly moderate the temperatures, typical to the [[northern coast of Egypt|Egypt's north coast]], making its summers moderately hot and humid while its winters mild and moderately [[precipitation (meteorology)|wet]] where [[Ice pellets|sleet]] and [[hail]] are also common.

[[Port Said#Climate|Port Said]], [[al-Qusayr, Egypt#Climate|Kosseir]], [[Ras El Bar#Climate|Ras El Bar]], [[Baltim#Climate|Baltim]], Damietta and [[Alexandria#Climate|Alexandria]] have the least temperature variation in [[climate of Egypt|Egypt]].

Damietta is very famous for its furniture industry. In addition to the Egyptian market, its furniture is sold in Arab countries, Africa, Europe, the United States, and almost all over the world.
Today, there is a canal connecting it to the [[Nile]], which has made it an important port once again. Containers are transported through the new [[Damietta Port]]. The Damietta governorate has a population of about 1,093,580 (2006). It contains the [[SEGAS LNG]] (Liquefied Natural Gas) plant,<ref name="MEED.">{{cite book|title=MEED.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z59WAAAAYAAJ|access-date=30 May 2012|date=April 2008|publisher=Economic East Economic Digest, Limited|page=187}}</ref> which will ultimately have a capacity of 9.6 million ton/year through two trains. The plant is owned by Segas, a joint venture of the Spanish utility [[Unión Fenosa]] (40%), Italian oil company [[Eni]] (40%) and the Egyptian companies EGAS and EGPC (10% each).<ref name="The petroleum economist">{{cite book|title=The Petroleum Economist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0usdAQAAMAAJ|access-date=30 May 2012|year=2008|publisher=Petroleum Press Bureau|page=20}}</ref> The plant is unusual since it is not supplied from a dedicated field, but is supplied with gas from the Egyptian grid. {{As of|2010}},  EMethanex, the Egyptian division of [[Methanex|Methanex Corporation]], a Canadian owned company, was building a 3600 MTPD methanol plant. Damietta also has a woodworking industry and is also noted for its White [[Domiati]] cheese and other dairy products<ref name="Halayeb">{{cite web|title=Halayeb|url=http://www.earabicmarket.com/en/halayeb|website=eArabic Market|access-date=17 December 2016}}</ref> and [[Pâtisserie]] and [[Egyptian cuisine#Desserts|Egyptian desserts]]. It is also a fishing port.
