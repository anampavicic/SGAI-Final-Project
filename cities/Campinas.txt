According to the 2020 estimate, the city's population is 1,139,047, making it the [[List of cities in Brazil by population|fourteenth most populous Brazilian city]] and the [[São Paulo (state)|third most populous municipality in São Paulo state]], the fifth most populous municipality in Southeast Brazil, and the largest city in Brazil outside the metro region of a state capital. The city's [[metropolitan area]], [[Metropolitan Region of Campinas]], contains twenty municipalities with a total population of 3,656,363 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agemcamp.sp.gov.br/rmc/|title=RMC - Agemcamp|website=sp.gov.br|access-date=2015-09-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930171441/http://www.agemcamp.sp.gov.br/rmc/|archive-date=2015-09-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Campinas means ''grass fields'' in Portuguese and refers to its characteristic landscape, which originally comprised large stretches of dense subtropical forests (mato grosso or thick woods in Portuguese), mainly along the many rivers, interspersed with gently rolling hills covered by low-lying vegetation.<ref>''ibidem'' http://campinasss.blogspot.com.br/2013/07/etymology.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718075143/http://campinasss.blogspot.com.br/2013/07/etymology.html |date=2014-07-18 }}</ref>

Campinas' official crest and flag has a picture of the mythical bird, the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], because it was practically reborn after a devastating [[epidemic]] of [[yellow fever]] in the 1800s, which killed more than 25% of the city's inhabitants.

==History==
[[File:Vista_Parcial_de_Campinas_em_1878.jpg|thumb|left|Campinas in 1878 during the [[Empire of Brazil]].]]
[[File:Mapa de Campinas de 1929.jpg|left|thumb|Maps of railways in Campinas in 1929]]

The city was founded on July 14, 1774, by Barreto Leme.<ref name="foundation">{{cite web | title=Campinas faz 233 anos hoje | url=http://www.cpopular.com.br/mostra_noticia.asp?noticia=1520595&area=2140&authent=8999D8D6264332BCDBED94130107FE | access-date=2009-01-06 | date=2007-07-14 | publisher=[[Correio Popular]] | language=pt }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It was initially a simple outpost on the way to [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Goiás]] serving the "[[Bandeirantes]]" who were in search of precious minerals and [[Indigenous people of Brazil|Indian]] [[slavery|slaves]]. In the first half of the 19th century, Campinas became a growing population center, with many [[coffee]], [[cotton]] and [[sugarcane]] [[farm]]s.

The construction of a [[railway]] linking the city of [[São Paulo]] to [[Santos (São Paulo)|Santos]]' seaport, in 1867, was very important for its growth. In the second half of the 19th century, with the abolition of [[Slavery in Brazil|slavery]], farming and [[industrialization]] attracted many foreign [[immigration|immigrants]] to replace the lost manpower, mainly from Italy.<ref>http://www.internations.org/campinas-expats/italians {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106014516/http://www.internations.org/campinas-expats/italians |date=2014-01-06 }} Italians in Campinas</ref>

Coffee became an important export and the city became wealthy. In consequence, a large service sector was established to serve the growing population, and in the first decades of the 20th century, Campinas could already boast of an [[opera house]], theaters, banks, movie theaters, radio stations, a [[orchestra|philharmonic]] orchestra, two newspapers (''[[Correio Popular]]'' and ''[[Diário do Povo (Campinas)|Diário do Povo]]''), a good public education system (with the Escola Normal de Campinas and the [[Colégio Culto à Ciência]]), and hospitals, such as the Santa Casa de Misericórdia (a [[Charitable organization|charity]] for poor people).

And the Casa de Saúde de Campinas (for the Italian community, formerly known as ''Circolo Italiani Uniti''), and the most important Brazilian research center in agricultural sciences, the [[Instituto Agronômico de Campinas]], which was founded by Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]]. Finally, the construction of the first Brazilian highway in 1938, between Campinas and São Paulo, the [[Anhanguera Highway]], was a turning point in the integration of Campinas into the rest of the state.

Campinas was the birthplace of opera composer [[Antônio Carlos Gomes|Carlos Gomes]]<ref>http://www.gounin.net/ACGUS/acgbious.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412220138/http://www.gounin.net/ACGUS/acgbious.htm |date=2013-04-12 }} Carlos Gomes Biography</ref> (1836&nbsp;— 1896) and of the President of the Republic [[Manoel Ferraz de Campos Salles|Campos Salles]] (1841&nbsp;— 1913).<ref>http://www.ayrtonmarcondes.com.br/blog/?page_id=307 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706151315/http://www.ayrtonmarcondes.com.br/blog/?page_id=307 |date=2011-07-06 }} Campos Salles</ref> It was home for 49 years to [[Hércules Florence]], reputed as one of the early inventors of [[photography]], [[photocopying]] and the [[mimeograph]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latin.discovery.com/features/000914langsdorff/langsdorffhome.html |title=Discovery Español - Expedición Langsdorff |access-date=2005-04-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050407133131/http://latin.discovery.com/features/000914langsdorff/langsdorffhome.html |archive-date=2005-04-07 }} Hercules Florence</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Campinas SP - panoramio (13).jpg|thumb|right|View of Campinas at dusk.]]

The area of the city, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, is {{convert|795.697|km2|sqmi|3|abbr=off}}; {{convert|238.3230|km2|sqmi|3|abbr=off}} of this is the urban area and {{convert|557.334|km2|sqmi|3|abbr=off}} remaining constitute greater Campinas. It is located at 22°54′21″S, 47°03′39″W and is at a distance of {{convert|96|km|mi|abbr=off}} northwest of São Paulo. Its neighboring cities are Paulínia, Jaguariúna and Pedreira, north; Morungaba, Itatiba and Valinhos in the east; Itupeva, Indaiatuba and Monte Mor, south, and Hortolândia in the west.

===Ecology===
Most of the original vegetation of the city was largely eliminated. Like 13 other municipalities in the metropolitan region of Campinas, the city is subject to some [[environmental stress]], and Campinas is considered one of the areas liable to [[flooding]] and [[silting]]; it now has less than 5% of [[vegetation]] cover in total area.<ref name="dolsenz.com">{{Cite web |url=http://www.dolsenz.com/campinas/ |title=Vegetation - Campinas |language=en |access-date=2014-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111161323/http://www.dolsenz.com/campinas/ |archive-date=2014-11-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Trying to reverse this situation, several projects have been and are being conducted and planned, such as building corridors, and the regulation of the Management Plan of Environmental Preservation Area (APA) in Campinas. There are also several environmental projects to combat the destruction of [[riparian forest]]s located along the banks of the [[Atibaia river]], which has a high level of [[pollution]]. Today, Campinas houses the [[Area of relevant ecological interest (Brazil)|area of relevant ecological interest]] (ARIE) [[Mata de Santa Genebra]], {{convert|251|acre|km2}}, established in 1985 by the city of Campinas' [[Fundação José Pedro de Oliveira]] and regulated by the Brazilian Environment and Renewable Natural Resources Institute ([[IBAMA]]). This is the now second-largest [[urban forest]] of Brazil, behind only the [[Tijuca Forest]], in [[Rio de Janeiro]].<ref name="dolsenz.com"/>

The city also has smaller urban [[forest]] [[wikt:Special:Search/groves|groves]] and [[reserve park]]s, such as the Bosque dos [[Jequitiba]]s (installed in [[1881]]), the Bosque dos Italianos (transl. Italian's Grove), the Bosque dos Alemães (transl. German's Grove), Guarantã's Park, as well as the larger Parque Portugal (Taquaral Lagoon, transl. Park and Lagoon of Bamboos), "Dom Bosco" Ecological Park and Monsenhor "Emílio José Salim" Ecological Park.<ref name="dolsenz.com"/>

===Climate===
[[File:Lightning in Campinas (see more photos on comments) (2167011677).jpg|thumb|right|View of Campinas during a [[storm]].]]
The city has a [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'' in Köppen scheme). It was [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] (''Cwa'' type in the [[Köppen classification]]) before the current climatic table (1981-2010 period).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=E.

Winters are generally dry and mild (rarely too cold), and summers rainy with warm to hot temperatures. The warmest month is February, with an average temperature of 24&nbsp;°C, an average maximum of 29.1&nbsp;°C and average minimum of 19.0&nbsp;°C. The coldest month, July, sees respective temperatures of 17.8&nbsp;°C, and 24.2&nbsp;°C and 11.4&nbsp;°C average maximum and minimum. Fall and spring are transitional seasons.

The average annual rainfall is 1424.5&nbsp;mm and the driest month in August, when there is only 22.9&nbsp;mm. In January, the rainiest month, the average is 280.3&nbsp;mm. In recent years, however, the hot, dry days during the winter have been increasingly frequent, often surpassing 30&nbsp;°C, especially between July and September. In August 2010, for example, the rainfall in Campinas was only 0&nbsp;mm. During the dry season and long dry spells in the middle of the rainy season are also common records of fires in the hills and thickets, especially in rural areas of the city, which contributes to deforestation and the release of pollutants into the atmosphere, further worsening air quality.
The lowest temperature recorded in the city was −1.5&nbsp;°C on June 25, 1918. The highest temperature was 39.0&nbsp;°C, observed on 17 November 1985. The highest cumulative rainfall recorded in 24 hours in the city between June 1988 and October 2008 was 143.4&nbsp;mm in 25 days May 2005. Between 1890 and 2004 there were 41 occurrences of frost in Campinas. The most recent was on July 18, 2000, when the minimum temperature reached 2.2&nbsp;°C. There are also occasional episodes of strong winds, with gusts exceeding 100&nbsp;km / h, and training records were made in the city day May 4, 2001 and March 9, 2008.

The wet season is from mid-October to mid-April, with heavier rains particularly in December, January, February and early March, and the dry season is from mid-May to mid-September. Average [[rainfall]] is 24.3&nbsp;mm in August and 267.8&nbsp;mm in January. Average [[humidity]] ranges from 37% (August) to 56% (January).

In the region around Campinas near the state of [[Minas Gerais]] there are a number of cities which enjoy an even milder mountain climate, such as [[Serra Negra]], [[Socorro, São Paulo|Socorro]], [[Lindóia]] and [[Águas de Lindoia]], where several water [[destination spa|spa]]s are located.
