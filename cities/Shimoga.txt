==History==
The name of the city is derived from the term ''shivmoga''. A version of the etymology is the story that [[Shiva]] drank the [[Tunga River]] hence the name "Shiva-Mukha" which means the "face of Shiva". Another version of the etymology is that the name is derived from the term ''Sihi-Mogge'', meaning "sweet pot".<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Shivamogga |url=https://shimoga.nic.in/en/history/ |website=Shivamogga District |publisher=National Informatics Centre, Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, Government of India |access-date=8 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804162908/https://shimoga.nic.in/en/history/ |archive-date=4 August 2020}}</ref>

The district formed the southern tip of the Emperor [[Ashoka]]'s [[Maurya]]n Empire in the third century BC.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} It was ruled during later centuries by the [[Kadamba dynasty|Kadamba]]s (4th century), [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]] (6th century), [[Western Ganga dynasty|Western Ganga]], [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakutas]] (8th century), [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysalas]] (11th century), and the [[Vijayanagara]] rulers (15th century). [[Nayakas of Keladi]], also known as ''Nayakas of Bednore'' and ''Ikkeri Nayakas'', were an [[India]]n [[dynasty]] based in [[Keladi]] in present-day [[Shimoga district]] of [[Karnataka]], [[India]]. They were an important ruling dynasty in [[History of Karnataka#Late Medieval and Early Modern period (1206–1799 CE)|late medieval and early modern Karnataka]]. They initially ruled as a vassal of the famous [[Vijayanagar Empire]]. After the fall of the empire in 1565, they gained independence and ruled significant parts of [[Malnad]] region of the [[Western Ghats]] in present-day Karnataka, most areas in the [[Kanara|coastal regions of Karnataka]], and parts of northern [[Kerala]], [[Malabar region|Malabar]] and the central plains along the [[Tungabhadra river|Tungabhadra]] river. In 1763 AD, with their defeat to [[Hyder Ali]], they were absorbed into the [[Kingdom of Mysore]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bK4Ba6824koC&q=kilidi&pg=PA128 |title=A journey from Madras through the ... – Google Books |isbn=9788120603868 |access-date=17 September 2011|last1=Buchanan |first1=Francis |last2=Hamilton |first2=Francis |year=1988 |publisher=Asian Educational Services }}</ref>
