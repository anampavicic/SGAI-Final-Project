Freiburg is located in [[Baden]], at the southwestern foothills of the [[Black Forest]], on the [[Dreisam]] River, a tributary of the [[Elz (Rhine)|Elz]]. It is Germany's southwestern- and southernmost city with a population exceeding 100,000. It lies in the [[Breisgau]], one of Germany's warmest regions, in the south of the [[Upper Rhine Plain]]. Its city limits reach from the [[Schauinsland]] summit ({{convert|1284|m|ft}}) in the Black Forest to {{convert|3|km|mi}} east of the French border, while Switzerland is {{convert|42|km|mi}} to the south. The city is situated in the major [[Baden (wine region)|wine-growing region of Baden]] and, together with [[Offenburg]], serves as a tourist entry-point to the scenic [[Black Forest]]. According to meteorological statistics, Freiburg  held the all-time German temperature record of {{convert|40.2|°C|1}} from 2003 to 2015.<ref>Website for the [[German Agricultural Society]]: Baden (accessed on 1 January 2008).{{cite web |url=http://www.wein.de/1462.0.html |title=Baden |access-date=2008-01-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030082816/http://www.wein.de/1462.0.html |archive-date=2007-10-30}}</ref><ref>[[Temperature extremes]]</ref>

An old university town and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Freiburg|archiepiscopal]] seat, it was incorporated in the early 12th century and soon became a commercial, intellectual and ecclesiastical center for the Upper Rhine region. The [[University of Freiburg]] (''Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg''), founded in 1457, is one of Germany's oldest universities. Freiburg's main landmark is the [[Freiburg Minster]] (''Freiburger Münster''), which was built between c. 1200 and 1513 and has been described as "Gothic architectural masterpiece".

The old town is traversed by an extensive system of runnels called [[Bächle]] ({{lit}} ''small streams''), that are fed with water from the [[Dreisam]] and run on the side and sometimes in the middle of almost all streets and alleys, giving the city a unique touch. Freiburg has a high [[standard of living]], and is known for its advanced environmental practices, which is embodied by projects like the creation of the sustainable [[Vauban, Freiburg|district of Vauban]].

The dialect spoken in Freiburg is classified as ([[Upper Rhine|Upper Rhenish]]) [[Low Alemannic]], and therefore most closely related to the other dialects of [[Baden]] north of [[Markgräflerland]] and south of [[Karlsruhe]], to most dialects historically spoken in [[Alsace]] ([[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]]), and to [[Basel German]].

==History==
{{see also|History of Freiburg}}
Freiburg was founded by Konrad and Duke Berthold III of the [[House of Zähringen]] in 1120 as a free market town;<ref name="frhist">

''Frei'' means "free", and ''Burg'', like the modern English word "[[borough]]", was used in those days for an incorporated city or town, usually one with some degree of autonomy.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=borough |title=borough |encyclopedia=American Heritage Dictionary |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|access-date=13 September 2019}}</ref> The German word ''Burg'' also means "a fortified town", as in [[Hamburg]]. Thus, it is likely that the name of this place means a "fortified town of free citizens".

This town was strategically located at a junction of trade routes between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[North Sea]] regions, and the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers. In 1200, Freiburg's population numbered approximately 6,000 people. At about that time, under the rule of [[Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen|Bertold V]], the last duke of Zähringen, the city began construction of its [[Freiburg Minster]] cathedral on the site of an older parish church.<ref name="frhist"/> Begun in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style, it was continued and completed 1513 for the most part as a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] edifice. In 1218, when Bertold V died, then Egino V von Urach, the count of [[County of Urach|Urach]] assumed the title of [[Counts of Freiburg|Freiburg's count]] as Egino I von Freiburg.<ref name="frhist"/> The city council did not trust the new nobles and wrote down its established rights in a document. At the end of the thirteenth century there was a feud between the citizens of Freiburg and their lord, Count Egino II of Freiburg. Egino II raised taxes and sought to limit the citizens' freedom, after which the Freiburgers used catapults to destroy the count's castle atop the [[Schlossberg (Freiburg)|Schloßberg]], a hill that overlooks the city center. The furious count called on his brother-in-law the [[Prince-Bishopric of Strasbourg]], [[Conrad of Lichtenberg]], for help. The bishop responded by marching with his army to Freiburg.

According to an old Freiburg legend, a butcher named Hauri stabbed the Bishop of Strasbourg to death on 29 July 1299. It was a [[Pyrrhic victory]], since henceforth the citizens of Freiburg had to pay an annual expiation of 300 marks in silver to the count of Freiburg until 1368. In 1366 the counts of Freiburg made another failed attempt to occupy the city during a night raid. Eventually the citizens were fed up with their lords, and in 1368 Freiburg purchased its independence from them. The city turned itself over to the protection of the [[Habsburgs]], who allowed the city to retain a large measure of freedom. Most of the nobles of the city died in the [[battle of Sempach]] (1386). The [[patricianship|patrician]] family Schnewlin took control of the city until the guildsmen revolted. The guilds became more powerful than the patricians by 1389.

The silver mines in Mount Schauinsland provided an important source of capital for Freiburg. This silver made Freiburg one of the richest cities in Europe, and in 1327 Freiburg minted its own coin, the ''Rappenpfennig''. In 1377 the cities of Freiburg, [[Basel]], [[Colmar]], and [[Breisach]] entered into a monetary alliance known as the ''Genossenschaft des Rappenpfennigs'' (Rappenpfennig Collective). This alliance facilitated commerce among the cities and lasted until the end of the sixteenth century. There were 8,000–9,000 people living in Freiburg between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and 30 churches and monasteries. At the end of the fourteenth century the veins of silver were dwindling, and by 1460 only approximately 6,000 people still lived within Freiburg's [[Defensive wall|city walls]].

A university city, Freiburg evolved from its focus on mining to become a cultural centre for the arts and sciences. It was also a commercial center. The end of the [[Middle Ages]] and the dawn of the [[Renaissance]] was a time of both advances and tragedy for Freiburg.

In 1457, [[Albert VI, Archduke of Austria|Albrecht VI]], Regent of [[Further Austria]], established [[Albert-Ludwigs-Universität]], one of Germany's oldest universities. In 1498, Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] held a [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]] in Freiburg. In 1520, the city ratified a set of legal reforms, widely considered the most progressive of the time. The aim was to find a balance between city traditions and old [[Roman Law]]. The reforms were well received, especially the sections dealing with civil process law, punishment, and the city's constitution.

[[File:Freiburg from above.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Freiburg Münster]] medieval cathedral]]

In 1520, Freiburg decided not to take part in the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and became an important centre for [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] on the [[Upper Rhine]]. [[Erasmus]] moved here after [[Basel]] accepted the Reformation. In 1536, a strong and persistent belief in [[witchcraft]] led to the city's first [[witch-hunt]]. The need to find a scapegoat for calamities such as the [[Black Plague]], which claimed 2,000 area residents (25% of the city population) in 1564, led to an escalation in witch-hunting that reached its peak in 1599. A plaque on the old city wall marks the spot where burnings were carried out.

The seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries were turbulent times for Freiburg. At the beginning of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in 1618, its population numbered between 10,000 to 14,000; when it ended in 1648, only 2,000 remained.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Thirty Years War|url=http://www.freiburg-madison.de/freiburg_history/1618-1648_Thirty_Years_War.htm|website=www.freiburg-madison.de|access-date=2020-05-28}}</ref> In August 1644, it was the site of the [[Battle of Freiburg]], said to be the bloodiest battle of the war in terms of percentage of casualties.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Thirty Years' War, 1618–1648, by Samuel Rawson Gardiner.|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/40082/40082-h/40082-h.htm|website=www.gutenberg.org|access-date=2020-05-28}}</ref> 

Between 1648 and 1805, when the city was not under French occupation it was the administrative headquarters of [[Further Austria]], the Habsburg territories in the southwest of Germany. In 1805, the city, together with the [[Breisgau]] and [[Ortenau]] areas, became part of [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]]. In 1827, when the [[Archdiocese of Freiburg]] was founded, Freiburg became the seat of a [[Catholic]] archbishop.

Freiburg was heavily bombed during [[World War II]]. In [[Bombing of Freiburg on 10 May 1940|May 1940]], aircraft of the [[Luftwaffe]] mistakenly dropped approximately 60 bombs on Freiburg near the railway station, killing 57 people, most of them civilians and including 22 children.<ref>{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=Derek | author-link =Derek Robinson (novelist) |title=Invasion 1940 |publisher=Constable & Robinson |year=2005 |location=London |pages=31–32 |isbn=1-84529-151-4}}</ref> This was reported by the official German news agency as an attack by the Western Allies, and retaliation against them was threatened. The Freiburg police commander subsequently established that the bombs were German, but the full story was not published until many years later.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Deighton |first1=Len |title=Blitzkrieg |date=2014 |publisher=William Collins |location=London |isbn=978-0-00754-951-1 |page=238}}</ref> On 27 November 1944, a raid by more than 300 [[bomber]]s of [[RAF Bomber Command]] ([[Operation Tigerfish]]) destroyed a large portion of the city centre, with the notable exception of the ''Münster'', which was only lightly damaged. After the war, the city was rebuilt on its medieval plan.

On 22 October 1940, the [[Nazi]] [[Gauleiter]] of Baden, [[Robert Heinrich Wagner]], ordered the deportation of all of Baden's and 350 of Freiburg's [[Jewish]] population. They were deported to [[Camp Gurs]] in the south of France, where many died. On 18 July 1942, the remaining Baden and Freiburg Jews were transferred to [[Auschwitz]] in [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|German-occupied Poland]], where almost all were murdered.<ref>Spector, Shmuel and Wigoder, Geoffrey, ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish life Before and During the Holocaust'', [[New York University Press]] 2001.

The memorial is a fountain and contains a bronze plaque commemorating the original building and the Jewish community which perished. The pavements of Freiburg carry memorials to individual victims, in the form of [[Stolperstein|brass plates]] outside their former residences. There was a camp for [[Sinti]] and [[Romani people]] (see ''[[Romani Holocaust]]'') in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=1483|title=Lager für Sinti und Roma Freiburg im Breisgau|website=Bundesarchiv.de|access-date=9 January 2024|language=de}}</ref>

It was occupied by the [[French Army]] on 21 April 1945, and Freiburg was soon allotted to the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|French Zone of Occupation]]. In December 1945 Freiburg became the seat of government for the German state of [[South Baden|Baden]], which was merged into [[Baden-Württemberg]] in 1952. The [[French Army]] maintained a presence in Freiburg until 1991, when the last French Army division left the city, and left Germany.

On the site of the former French Army base, a new neighborhood for 5,000 people, [[Vauban (Freiburg)|Vauban]], began in the late 1990s as a "sustainable model district".{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Solar power provides electricity to many of the households in this small community.

==Points of interest==
Because of its scenic beauty, relatively warm and sunny climate, and easy access to the [[Black Forest]], Freiburg is a hub for regional [[tourism]]. In 2010, Freiburg was voted as the Academy of Urbanism's European City of the Year in recognition of the exemplary [[sustainable urbanism]] it has implemented over the past several decades.

The longest [[Aerial tramway|cable car]] run in Germany, which is {{convert|3.6|km|mi}} long, runs from [[Günterstal]] up to a nearby mountain called ''[[Schauinsland]]''.

The city has an unusual system of gutters (called ''[[Freiburg Bächle]]'') that run throughout its centre. These ''Bächle'', once used to provide water to fight fires and feed livestock, are constantly flowing with water diverted from the [[Dreisam]]. They were never intended to be used for sewage, and even in the Middle Ages such use could lead to harsh penalties. During the summer, the running water provides natural cooling of the air, and offers a pleasant gurgling sound. It is said that if one accidentally falls or steps into a ''Bächle'', they will marry a Freiburger, or 'Bobbele'.

[[File:Friburgo Ruscelli nel Centro -- Freiburg with the city center streams.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Freiburg Bächle|Bächle]]]]
The ''Augustinerplatz'' is one of the central squares in the old city. Formerly the location of an [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[Augustinian Monastery, Freiburg|monastery]] that became the [[Augustiner Museum]] in 1921, it is now a popular social space for Freiburg's younger residents. It has a number of restaurants and bars, including the local brewery 'Feierling', which has a [[Biergarten]]. On warm summer nights, hundreds of students gather here.

At the centre of the [[Old City of Freiburg|old city]] is the [[Minster Square (Freiburg im Breisgau)|Münsterplatz]] or Cathedral Square, Freiburg's [[List of city squares by size|largest square]]. A farmers' market is held here every day except Sundays. This is the site of Freiburg's [[Freiburg Münster|Münster]], a [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] [[Minster (cathedral)|minster]] [[cathedral]] constructed of red sandstone, built between 1200 and 1530 and noted for its towering spire.

[[File:Historisches Kaufhaus Freiburg.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Historical Merchants' Hall of 1520–21]]
The [[Historical Merchants' Hall (Freiburg)|Historical Merchants' Hall]] (''Historisches Kaufhaus''), is a [[Gothic architecture|Late Gothic]] building on the south side of Freiburg's ''Münsterplatz''. Built between 1520 and 1530, it was once the center of the financial life of the region. Its façade is decorated with statues and the [[coat of arms]] of four [[Habsburg]] emperors.

The ''Altes Rathaus'', or old city hall, was completed in 1559 and has a painted façade. The ''Platz der alten Synagoge'' "Old Synagogue Square" is one of the more important squares on the outskirts of the historic old city. The square was the location of a synagogue until it was destroyed on {{lang|de|[[Kristallnacht]]}} in 1938. [[Zum Roten Bären]], the oldest hotel in Germany, is located along ''Oberlinden'' near the [[Swabia]]n Gate.

The ''[[Siegesdenkmal]]'', or victory monument, is a monument to the German victory in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1871. It is situated at the northern edge of the historic city center of Freiburg and was built by [[Karl Friedrich Moest]]. In everyday language of people living in Freiburg, it serves as an orientation marker or as a meeting place.

To the east of the city centre, the [[Schlossberg (Freiburg)|Schlossberg]] hill provides extensive views over the city and surrounding region. The castle (Schloss) from which the hill takes its name was demolished in the 1740s, and only ruins remain. Schlossberg retained its importance to the city, however, and 150 years ago the city leaders opened up walks and views to make the mountain available to the public. Today, the [[Schlossbergbahn (Freiburg)|Schlossbergbahn]] [[funicular|funicular railway]] connects the city centre to the hill.<ref name=sbb>{{cite web |url=http://www.freiburg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1204575/index.html |publisher=Stadt Freiburg |title=Erlebniswelt Schlossberg | trans-title = Experience Schlossberg |language=de | access-date = 2011-02-13 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110405115733/http://www.freiburg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1204575/index.html | archive-date = 2011-04-05}}</ref>

== Geography ==
{{wide image|Freiburg_Schlossbergturm_Panorama_2010.jpg|1400px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view of Freiburg, seen from Schlossberg. [[Freiburg Münster]] can be seen just right of  centre.}}
Freiburg is bordered by the Black Forest mountains [[Roßkopf (Breisgau)|Rosskopf]] and Bromberg to the east, Schönberg and Tuniberg to the south, with the [[Kaiserstuhl (Baden-Württemberg)|Kaiserstuhl]] hill region to the west.

===Climate===
The [[Köppen climate classification]] classifies Freiburg's climate as [[temperate oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''; [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Dobk''). Thus, July and August are, along with [[Karlsruhe]], the warmest within Germany. Winters are moderate but usually with some frosts at night. More year-round rain occurs here than in the Rhine plateau. The city is close to the [[Kaiserstuhl (Baden-Württemberg)|Kaiserstuhl]], a range of hills of volcanic origin located a few kilometers away, which is one of the warmest places in Germany and therefore considered as a viticultural area.

==Government==
Freiburg is known as an "eco-city". In June 1995, the Freiburg city council adopted a resolution that it would permit construction only of "[[low-energy house|low-energy buildings]]" on municipal land, and all new buildings must comply with certain low energy specifications. The neighbourhoods of [[Vauban, Freiburg|Vauban]] and [[Rieselfeld]] were developed and built in the late 1990s in accordance with the principles of [[sustainability]]. The city is also home to a branch of the [[Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz|Federal Office for Radiation Protection]], as well as [[Solar power|solar industry]] and research. The citizens of Freiburg are known in Germany for their love of [[cycling]] and [[recycling]].<ref name="frei">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/mar/23/freiburg.germany.greenest.city/print |title=Freiburg, Germany: is this the greenest city in the world? |author=Andrew Purvis |work=the Guardian|date=23 March 2008 |access-date=17 March 2016}}</ref> Freiburg is host to a number of [[international organisation]]s, in particular, [[ICLEI]] – Local Governments for Sustainability, [[International Solar Energy Society]], and the City Mayors Foundation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citymayors.com/gratis/city_mayors.html |title=City Mayors: About City Mayors|access-date=17 March 2016}}</ref> Politically, it is a longtime stronghold of the [[Alliance 90/The Greens]], who have seen consistent success since the 1990s and have been the largest party on the city council since 2004. For many years, they performed more strongly in Freiburg than any other major city: former mayor [[Dieter Salomon]], who served from 2002 to 2018, was the first member of the Greens to hold such an office in a city of over 100,000 people.

==Religion==

'''Christianity'''

Freiburg belonged to Austria until 1805 and remained Catholic, although surrounding villages like [[Haslach (Freiburg)|Haslach]], Opfingen, Tiengen, and the surrounding land ruled by the [[Margrave of Baden]] became Protestant as a result of the Reformation. The city was part of the [[Diocese of Konstanz]] until 1821. That same year, Freiburg became an [[episcopal see]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Freiburg]]. Due to a dispute between the government of Baden and the [[Holy See]], the [[Archbishop of Freiburg|archbishop]] officially took office in 1827.
[[File:Freiburger-muenster.png|thumb|250px|right|The Freiburger Minster: one of Freiburg's most famous landmarks]]

The borders of the archdiocese correspond with the borders of the former [[State of Baden|province of Baden]] and the former Margraviate of Hohenzollern. The cathedral, in which the bishop resides, is [[Freiburg Minster]]. Also, part of the [[ecclesiastical province]] of Freiburg are the [[suffragan diocese]]s of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mainz|Mainz]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart|Rottenburg-Stuttgart]].

Until 1929, the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg|Limburg]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Fulda|Fulda]] also belonged to this ecclesiastical province. The Archbishop of Freiburg holds the title of metropolitan and the German headquarters of the [[link to Caritas Germany]] is in Freiburg.

[[Saint George]] (the flag of Freiburg has the cross of George), [[Lambert of Maastricht]] and the catacomb saint, [[Alexander of Bergamo|Alexander]], are the patron saints of Freiburg. Many works of art depicting these saints are in the Freiburg Minster, on the Minster square, just as in the museums and archives of the city, including some by [[Hans Baldung Grien]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] and [[Gregorius Sickinger]].

In 1805, with the attack of Breisgau on the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] by a Catholic ruler, many Protestants moved into the city. Since 2007, any Protestants who are not part of a 'free church' belong to the newly founded deanery of Freiburg as part of the parish of Südbaden which in itself is a part of the Landeskirche Baden.

The seat of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Baden]], a free Lutheran church, is situated in Freiburg. There are multiple other free Protestant churches: e.g., the Calvary Chapel or Chrischona International. An old congregation has existed in Freiburg since the late 1900s, which utilises the old monastery church of the Ursulines in the black monastery at the border of the old city center. The Catholic Church of St. Maria Schutz has been made available for Masses by Greek, Serbian, Russian and Rumanian Orthodox congregations.

'''Judaism'''
{{Main|History of the Jews in Freiburg im Breisgau}}

[[Jews]] are said to have lived in the city before 1230, but it was only after 1230 that they supposedly founded an official community in the Webergasse (a small street within the town center). The counts of Freiburg bought the lucrative [[Schutzjude]], which means that all personal information on Jews living in Freiburg was directly sent to [[Konrad II]] and his co-reigning son Friedrich. The two issued a comprising letter promising safety and liberty to all local Jews on 12 October 1338. It lost all value shortly after, however, on 1 January 1349. Although the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] had not yet broken out in the city, Jews were accused of having spread it and taken into custody. All Jews except pregnant women were burned alive on 31 January 1349. The remaining children were forced to be baptised. This pogrom left Jews very hesitant to resettle in the city. In 1401, the city council decreed a regulation banning all Jews from Freiburg (orig. Middle High German dialect: “daz dekein Jude ze Friburg niemmerme sin sol” [27]. This was officially reaffirmed by King Sigismund with a ban for life (orig. German: “Ewige Vertreibung”) in 1424. Not until 1809 were Jews again allowed permanent residence within the city. They subsequently founded a Jewish community in 1836.

At the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, the synagogue, built in 1870, was set afire. Numerous shops and apartments of Jewish citizens of Freiburg were devastated and plundered by National Socialists without the intervention of police or fire department. Male, wealthy, Jewish citizens were kidnapped and taken to [[concentration camps]] (in [[Buchenwald]] and [[Dachau, Bavaria|Dachau]]) where they were subjected to forced labor or executed and their money and property stolen.

On 22 October 1940, the remaining Jews of Baden and Pfalz were deported to [[Gurs internment camp|Camp de Gurs]] in southern France. One among many collecting points was Annaplatz. So-called '[[Stolpersteine]]', tiles with names and dates on them, commemorate the victims of the prosecution of Jews during the Nazi-Era in the city's cobble. Journalist Käthe Vordtriede of the [[Volkswacht (Freiburg)|Volkswacht]] even received two Stolpersteine to commemorate her life. The first one was inserted into the ground in front of the Vordtriede-Haus Freiburg in 2006 and the second one in front of the Basler Hof, the regional authorities, in spring 2013. This was also the seat of the [[Gestapo]] until 1941, where unrelenting people were cruelly interrogated, held prisoner or deported. The only solutions were flight or emigration. The [[Werner Vordtriede|Vordtriede family]] managed to escape in time.

==Transport==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2021}}
[[File:Combino Freiburg.jpg|thumb|230px|Freiburg VAG tram|left]]
Freiburg has a large [[Auto-free zone|pedestrian zone]] in the city centre where no motor cars are allowed. Freiburg also has an extensive public transport system, operated by the city-owned [[Freiburger Verkehrs AG|VAG Freiburg]]. The backbone of the system is the [[Trams in Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg tramway network]], supplemented by feeder [[bus]]es. The tram network is very popular as the low fares allow for unlimited transport in the city and surrounding area. Furthermore, any ticket for a concert, sports or other event is also valid for use on public transport. The tram network is so vast that 70% of the population live within 500m of a tram stop with a tram every 7–8 mins.

Freiburg is on the main [[Mannheim–Karlsruhe–Basle railway|Frankfurt am Main – Basel railway line]], with frequent and fast long-distance passenger services from the [[Freiburg Hauptbahnhof]] to major German and other European cities. Other railway lines run east into the [[Black Forest]] and west to [[Breisach]] and are served by the [[Breisgau S-Bahn]]. The line to Breisach is the remaining stub of the [[Freiburg–Colmar railway|Freiburg–Colmar international railway]], severed in 1945 when the railway bridge over the [[Rhine]] at Breisach was destroyed, and was never replaced.
