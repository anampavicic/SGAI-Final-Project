It is the prefecture of the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Loiret]] and of the [[Regions of France|region]] of [[Centre-Val de Loire]].

Orléans is located on the river [[Loire]] nestled in the heart of the Loire Valley, classified as a [[Loire Valley|World Heritage Site]], where the river curves south towards the [[Massif Central]]. In 2020, the city had 117,026 inhabitants within its municipal boundaries.<ref name=pophist/> Orléans is the center of [[Orléans Métropole]] that has a population of 290,346.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/7633058?geo=EPCI-244500468#ancre-POP_T1 |title=Évolution et structure de la population en 2020 − Intercommunalité-Métropole de Orléans Métropole (244500468) |language=fr |publisher=INSEE |access-date=24 January 2024}}</ref> The larger [[Functional area (France)|metropolitan area]] has a population of 454,208, the 20th largest in France.<ref name=AAV2020>{{cite web|url=https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/7633058?geo=AAV2020-025#ancre-POP_T1 |title=Évolution et structure de la population en 2020 − Aire d'attraction des villes 2020 d'Orléans (025) |language=fr |publisher=INSEE |access-date=24 January 2024}}</ref>

The city owes its development from [[Late antiquity|antiquity]] to the commercial exchanges resulting from the river. An important river trade port, it was the headquarters of the community of merchants frequenting the Loire. It was the capital of the [[Kingdom of France]] during the [[Merovingian period]] and played an important role in the [[Hundred Years' War]], particularly known for the role of [[Joan of Arc]] during the [[siege of Orléans]]. Every first week of May since 1432, the city pays homage to the [[Joan of Arc|"Maid of Orléans"]] during the Johannic Holidays which has been listed in the inventory of [[List of Intangible Cultural Heritage elements in Northern Europe|intangible cultural heritage in France]]. One of [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|Europe's oldest universities]] was created in 1306 by [[Pope Clement V]] and re-founded in 1966 as the [[University of Orléans]], hosting more than 20,000 students in 2019.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.larep.fr/orleans-45000/actualites/il-y-aurait-pres-de-20-000-etudiants-a-orleans-vrai-ou-faux_13927992/ | title=Vérification - Il y aurait près de 20.000 étudiants à Orléans : Vrai ou faux ? | date=6 May 2021 }}</ref>

The [[Île d'Orléans]] in Quebec, Canada, takes its name from Orléans, as do [[Orléans, Ontario]], Orleans, Massachusetts and the city of [[New Orleans]], Louisiana.

==Geography==
[[File:ORLEANS From Flight ORY-MAD 737 EC-LQX (7951291066).jpg|thumb|left|Orléans from above|270px]]
Orléans is located in the northern bend of the Loire, which crosses from east to west. Orléans belongs to the [[Loire Valley|vallée de la Loire]] sector between [[Sully-sur-Loire]] and [[Chalonnes-sur-Loire]], which was in 2000 inscribed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]]. The capital of [[Orléanais]], 120 kilometres southwest of Paris, is bordered to the north by the [[Beauce, France|Beauce]] region, more specifically the [[Forest of Orléans|Orléans Forest]] (French: ''forêt d'Orléans'') and Orléans-la-Source neighbourhood, and the [[Sologne]] region to the south.

Five bridges in the city cross the Loire: Pont de l'Europe, Pont du Maréchal Joffre (also called Pont Neuf), [[George V Bridge, Orléans|Pont George-V]] (also called Pont Royal, carrying the commune [[trams|tramway]]), Pont René-Thinat and Pont de Vierzon (rail bridge).
[[File:Orléans Pont George V 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[George V Bridge, Orléans|Pont George-V]]|270px]]

To the north of the Loire (''rive droite'') is to be found a small hill ({{Convert|102|m|abbr=on}} at the pont Georges-V, {{Convert|110|m|abbr=on}} at the Place du Martroi) which gently rises to {{Convert|125|m|abbr=on}} at la Croix Fleury, at the limits of [[Fleury-les-Aubrais]]. Conversely, the south (on the ''rive gauche'') has a gentle [[depression (geology)|depression]] to about {{Convert|95|m|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (at Saint-Marceau) between the Loire and the Loiret, designated a "zone inondable" (flood-risk zone).

At the end of the 1960s, the {{ill|Orléans-la-Source|fr}} neighbourhood was created, {{Convert|12|km|mi|0}}to the south of the original commune and separated from it by the Val d'Orléans and the river [[Loiret (river)|Loiret]] (whose source is in the [[Parc Floral de la Source]]). This quarter's altitude varies from about {{Convert|100|to|110|m|abbr=on}}.

===Climate===
Orléans experiences an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), similar to much of central France. July, the warmest month, has an average temperature of {{convert|19.4|C}} and a high of {{convert|25.4|C}}, while January, the coldest month, has an average temperature of {{convert|3.9|C}} and an average low temperature of {{convert|1.1|C}}, although February has a lower average low than January at {{convert|0.9|C}}. The record high temperature is {{convert|41.3|C}} recorded in July, while the record low temperature of {{convert|-19.8|C}} was recorded in January.

Precipitation is evenly distributed year-round, with Orléans receiving {{convert|642.5|mm}} of precipitation annually. However, some months are slightly wetter than others, with the driest month receiving {{convert|44.4|mm}} of rain and the wettest receiving {{convert|64.4|mm}} of precipitation on average. Precipitation days vary more, with less of them in the summer months than in the other seasons. Humidity is high year-round but decreases slightly in summer. July and August only have their humidity at 72% but December has 90% humidity on average. Orléans receives 1,767.3 hours of sunshine annually, with summer being the sunniest season and winter being the least sunny season. August, receiving 224.6 hours of sunshine on average, is the sunniest month, and December, receiving 56.6 hours of sunshine on average, has the least amount of sunshine.

===The Loire and navigation===
[[File:La Loire à Orléans.jpg|thumb|The Loire as it flows through Orléans|400px]]
In Orléans, the Loire is separated by a submerged [[dike (construction)|dike]] known as the ''dhuis'' into the ''Grande Loire'' to the north, no longer navigable, and the ''Petite Loire'' to the south. This dike is just one part of a vast system of construction that previously allowed the Loire to remain navigable to this point.

The Loire was formerly an important navigation and trading route, and is at the heart of the city's foundation in the second century BC as a center of trade or [[Emporium (antiquity)|emporium]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Orleans, emporium des Carnutes |url=https://archeologie.orleans-metropole.fr/dossiers-thematiques/les-temoins-de-lhistoire/orleans-emporium-des-carnutes |website=Archeologie Orleans Metropole}}</ref> More recently, during the 17th century, the river enabled Orleans to become a major hub for refining sugar, which was imported from the Caribbean via [[Nantes]], and whose commerce boosted other aspects of the local economy, such as sweets, chocolate manufacturing, and paper for wrapping.<ref>{{cite web |title=Les raffineries de sucre |url=https://archives.orleans-metropole.fr/r/85/les-raffineries-de-sucre/ |website=Archives Orleans Ville et Metropole}}</ref> In the 18th century, Orleans also acquired a reputation for producing vinegar, from local vineyards as well as wine traveling up the Loire.<ref>{{cite web |title=Le vinaigre et Orleans |url=https://archives.orleans-metropole.fr/r/84/le-vinaigre-et-orleans/ |website=Archives Orleans Ville et Metropole}}</ref>

With the increase in size of ocean-going ships, large ships can now navigate the [[estuary]] only up to about [[Nantes]].

[[File:L'Inexplosible, Orléans.JPG|thumb|''L'Inexplosible n°22'', replica paddle steamer]]
Boats on the river were traditionally flat-bottomed boats, with large but foldable masts so the sails could gather wind from above the river banks, but the masts could be lowered in order to allow the boats to pass under bridges. These vessels are known as "gabarre", "futreau"'','' and so on, and may be viewed by tourists near pont Royal.

The river's irregular flow strongly limits traffic on it, in particular at its ascent, though this can be overcome by boats being given a tow.

An {{ill|inexplosible|lt=''Inexplosible''-type|fr}} [[paddle steamer]] owned by the mairie was put in place in August 2007, facing Place de la Loire and containing a bar.

Every two years, the Festival de Loire recalls the role played by the river in the commune's history.

On the river's north bank, near the town centre, is the [[Canal d'Orléans]], which connects to the [[Canal du Loing]] and the [[Canal de Briare]] at [[Buges]] near [[Montargis]]. The canal is no longer used along its whole length. Its route within Orléans runs parallel to the river, separated from it by a wall or ''muret'', with a promenade along the top. Its last [[canal pound|pound]] was transformed into an outdoor swimming pool in the 1960s, then filled in. It was reopened in 2007 for the "fêtes de Loire." There are plans to revive use of the canal for recreation and install a pleasure-boat port there.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Orléans}}

===Prehistory and Roman Empire===
:''See also [[Cenabum]], Aureliana Civitas.''
'''Cenabum''' was a [[Gauls|Gaul]] stronghold, one of the principal towns of the tribe of the [[Carnutes]] where the [[Druid]]s held their annual assembly. The Carnutes were massacred and the city was destroyed by [[Julius Caesar]] in 52 BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0001:book=7:chapter=28|title=C. Julius Caesar, Gallic War, Book 7, chapter 28|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2018-02-16}}</ref> In the late 3rd century AD, [[Roman emperor|Roman Emperor]] [[Aurelian]] rebuilt the city and renamed it '''civitas Aurelianorum''' ("city of Aurelian") after himself.<ref>{{cite web|last=Larousse|first=Éditions|title=Orléans - LAROUSSE|url=https://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/ville/Orl%C3%A9ans/136330|access-date=2021-04-28|website=www.larousse.fr|language=fr}}</ref> The name later evolved into Orléans.<ref>For an exact etymology, see ''Cenabum, Aurelianis, Orléans'' de Jacques Debal (Coll. Galliae civitates, Lyon, PUL, 1996)</ref>

In 442 Flavius Aetius, the Roman commander in Gaul, requested [[Goar]], head of the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] tribe of [[Alans]] in the region to come to Orleans and control the rebellious natives and the Visigoths. Accompanying the [[Vandals]], the Alans crossed the Loire in 408. One of their groups, under [[Goar]], joined the Roman forces of [[Flavius Aetius]] to fight [[Attila]] when he invaded Gaul in 451, taking part in the [[Battle of Châlons]] under their king [[Sangiban]]. Goar established his capital in Orléans. His successors later took possession of the estates in the region between Orléans and Paris. Installed in Orléans and along the Loire, they were unruly (killing the town's senators when they felt they had been paid too slowly or too little) and resented by the local inhabitants. Many inhabitants around the present city have names bearing witness to the Alan presence – Allaines. Also many places in the region bear names of Alan origin.<ref>[http://www.marres.education/alans.htm marres.education] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200520022911/https://www.marres.education/alans.htm |date=20 May 2020 }}. Accessed January 2016.</ref>

===Early Middle Ages===
In the [[Merovingian]] era, the city was capital of the Kingdom of Orléans following [[Clovis I]]'s division of the kingdom, then under the [[House of Capet|Capetian]]s it became the capital of a [[Count of Orléans|county]] then [[Duke of Orléans|duchy]] held in [[appanage]] by the house of Valois-Orléans. The Valois-Orléans family later acceded to the throne of France via [[Louis XII]], then [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]. In 1108, [[Louis VI of France]] became one of the few French monarchs to be crowned outside of [[Reims]] when he was crowned in [[Orléans cathedral]] by [[Daimbert, Archbishop of Sens]].

===High Middle Ages===
[[File:View of Orléans 1428 - Project Gutenberg etext 19488.jpg|thumb|left|Orléans in September 1428, the time of the [[siege of Orléans]].]]
[[File:Vigiles du roi Charles VII 18.JPG|thumbnail|250px|15th-century depiction of the French troops attacking an English fort at the siege of Orléans]]

The city was always a strategic point on the Loire, for it was sited at the river's most northerly point, and thus its closest point to Paris. There were few bridges over the dangerous river [[Loire]], but Orléans had one of them, and so became – with [[Rouen]] and Paris – one of medieval France's three richest cities.

On the south bank the "[[Fortress|châtelet]] des Tourelles" protected access to the bridge. This was the site of the [[Siege of Orléans|battle]] on 8 May 1429 which allowed [[Joan of Arc]] to enter and lift the siege of the [[Plantagenets]] during the [[Hundred Years' War]], with the help of the royal generals [[Jean de Dunois|Dunois]] and {{ill|Florent d'Illiers|fr}}. The city's inhabitants have continued to remain faithful and grateful to her to this day, calling her "la pucelle d'Orléans" (the maid of Orléans), offering her a middle-class house in the city, and contributing to her ransom when she was taken prisoner.
[[File:Orleans Monument Joan of Arc.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Joan of Arc]], Place du Martroi]]

===1453 to 1699===
[[File:1581-Aurelia Franciae civitas ad Ligeri flu.JPG|thumb|''Aurelia Franciae civitas ad Ligeri flu. sita'' (1581)]]
[[File:Hôtel Groslot, Orléans, France, 2012..JPG|thumb|The Renaissance Hôtel Groslot]]

Once the [[Hundred Years' War]] was over, the city recovered its former prosperity. The bridge brought in tolls and taxes, as did the merchants passing through the city. King [[Louis XI]] also greatly contributed to its prosperity, revitalising agriculture in the surrounding area (particularly the exceptionally fertile land around [[Beauce, France|Beauce]]) and relaunching [[saffron]] farming at [[Pithiviers]]. Later, during the [[Renaissance]], the city benefited from its becoming fashionable for rich [[châtelain]]s to travel along the Loire valley (a fashion begun by the king himself, whose royal domains included the nearby châteaus at [[Chambord, Loir-et-Cher|Chambord]], [[Amboise]], [[Blois]], and [[Château de Chenonceau|Chenonceau]]).

The [[University of Orléans]] also contributed to the city's prestige. Specializing in law, it was highly regarded throughout Europe. [[John Calvin]] was received and accommodated there (and wrote part of his reforming theses during his stay), and in return [[Henry VIII of England]] (who had drawn on Calvin's work in his separation from Rome) offered to fund a scholarship at the university. Many other Protestants were sheltered by the city. Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, better known by his pseudonym [[Molière]], also studied law at the University, but was expelled for attending a carnival contrary to university rules.

From 13 December 1560 to 31 January 1561, the [[Estates General (France)|French States-General]] after the death of [[Francis II of France]], the eldest son of [[Catherine de Médicis]] and [[Henry II of France|Henry II]]. He died in the Hôtel Groslot in Orléans, with his queen [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary]] at his side.

The [[Orléans Cathedral|cathedral]] was rebuilt several times. The present structure had its first stone laid by [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], and work on it took a century. It thus is a mix of late Renaissance and early [[Rococo|Louis XIV]] styles, and one of the last cathedrals to be built in France.

===1700–1900===
When France colonised America, the territory it conquered was immense, including the whole [[Mississippi River]] (whose first European name was the River [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]]), from its mouth to its source at the borders of Canada. Its capital was named ''[[New Orleans|la Nouvelle-Orléans]]'' in honour of [[Louis XV]]'s regent, the [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|duke of Orléans]], and was settled with French inhabitants against the threat from British troops to the north-east.

The Dukes of Orléans hardly ever visited their city since, as brothers or cousins of the king, they took such a major role in court life that they could hardly ever leave. The duchy of Orléans was the largest of the French duchies, starting at [[Arpajon]], continuing to [[Chartres]], [[Vendôme]], [[Blois]], [[Vierzon]], and [[Montargis]]. The duke's son bore the title ''duke of Chartres''. Inheritances from great families and marriage alliances allowed them to accumulate huge wealth, and one of them, [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe Égalité]], is sometimes said to have been the richest man in the world at the time. His son, King [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe I]], inherited the Penthièvre and Condé family fortunes.

1852 saw the creation of the ''Compagnies ferroviaires Paris-Orléans'' and its famous [[gare d'Orsay]] in Paris. In the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, the city again became strategically important thanks to its geographical position, and was occupied by the [[Prussia]]ns on 13 October that year. The ''[[armée de la Loire]]'' was formed under the orders of [[Louis d'Aurelle de Paladines|General d'Aurelle de Paladines]] and based itself not far from Orléans at [[Beauce, France|Beauce]].

During the [[Second World War]], the German army made the ''Orléans Fleury-les-Aubrais'' railway station one of their central logistical rail hubs. The Pont Georges V was renamed "pont des Tourelles".<ref>World-wide current events of 16 May 1941, available on the site of the [[Institut national de l'audiovisuel|INA]] ([http://www.ina.fr/archivespourtous/index.php?vue=notice&id_notice=AFE85000506 direct link]).</ref> A transit camp for deportees was built at [[Beaune-la-Rolande]]. During the war, the American Air Force heavily bombed the city and the train station, causing much damage. The city was one of the first to be rebuilt after the war: the reconstruction plan and city improvement initiated by Jean Kérisel and Jean Royer was adopted as early as 1943, and work began as early as the start of 1945. This reconstruction in part identically reproduced what had been lost, such as Royale and its arcades, but also used innovative prefabrication techniques, such as îlot 4 under the direction of the architect [[Pol Abraham]].<ref>Joseph Abram, ''L'architecture moderne en France, du chaos à la croissance'', tome 2, éd. Picard, 1999, pp. 28 et 37–38</ref>

The big city of former times is today an average-sized city of 250,000 inhabitants. It is still using its strategically central position less than an hour from the French capital to attract businesses interested in reducing transport costs.

===Heraldry===
[[File:Arms of Orléans.svg|thumb|left|Arms of Orléans|100px]]
According to [[Victor Adolphe Malte-Brun]] in ''La France Illustrée'', 1882, Orléans's arms are "[[gules]], three caillous in ''cœurs de lys'' [[argent]], and on a chief [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]], three fleurs de lys [[or (heraldry)|Or]]."  Charle Grandmaison, in the ''Dictionnaire Héraldique'' of 1861, states that it is "Or, with three hearts in gules", without the chief of France. Faulty designs sometimes describe it as "gules, three fleurs de lys argent, and on a chief azure three fleurs de lys Or."<ref>[[Grand Larousse encyclopédique]] in 10 volumes, 163</ref>

The "cœurs de lys", or heart of a lily, is not a true lily, which would have 6 [[tepal]]s, but a stylized or symbolic lily. Certain authors solve the problem by calling this symbol a "[[tiercefeuille]]", defined as a stemless [[clover]] leaf, with one leaf at the top and two below, thus making this coat of arms "gules, with three reversed tiercefeuilles in argent, etc".

===Motto===
"Hoc vernant lilia corde" (granted by [[Louis XII]], then [[duke of Orléans]]), meaning "It is by this heart that lilies flourish" or "This heart makes lilies flourish", referring to the [[fleur de lys]], symbol of the French royal family.

* The Gallo-Roman town-wall on the north side of the cathedral (4th century AD) and along the rue de la Tour-Neuve
* The ''Hôtel Groslot'', built between 1550 and 1555 for Jacques Groslot, "bailli d'Orléans" by Jacques Ier Androuet du Cerceau. King [[Francis II of France|François II of France]] died there in 1560. Kings [[Charles IX de France|Charles IX]], Henri III of France and [[Henry IV of France|Henri IV of France]] stayed there. The "Hôtel" was restored in 1850. The building became the town Hall of Orléans in 1790 (weddings are still celebrated inside), before the council moved to the current [[Hôtel de Ville, Orléans|Hôtel de Ville]] in 1981.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.larep.fr/orleans-45000/actualites/lecole-marcel-proust-a-decouvert-la-vie-de-la-mairie_13568760/  |title= L'école Marcel-Proust a découvert la vie de la mairie|date=24 May 2019|newspaper=la République| access-date=28 October 2024}}</ref>
* The ''hôtel de la Vieille Intendance'' (early 15th century) (otherwise named hôtel Brachet, formerly "The King's house"), real gothic-renaissance style château made of bricks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://orleans.tribunal-administratif.fr/quelques-mots/ |title=Tribunal administratif d'Orléans : Histoire du tribunal |access-date=2014-11-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422154752/http://orleans.tribunal-administratif.fr/quelques-mots/ |archive-date=22 April 2014}}</ref> Nowadays housing the Administrative Court of Orléans. One can admire its frontage from the entrance in the rue de la Bretonnerie. Yet, the building – which sheltered the highest figures of the kingdom passing by the city, and maybe some kings themselves (Henri IV, Louis XIII, Louis XIV of France) – can easily be observed from its gardens, opened to the public (entrance rue d'Alsace-Lorraine).
* The ''hôtel de la Motte-Sanguin'' (18th century) and its gardens, manor built at the behest of [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orléans]] (1747–1793), cousin of the King Louis XVI. He was surnamed "Philippe Égalité" / "equality" referring to his support to the 1789 revolutionaries. Nicknamed "''the richest man on earth''" he voted in favour of the death penalty against his own cousin the king [[Louis XVI]], and suffered the same fate himself. This is a classic style princely residence (and even royal, since Philippe Égalité's heir accessed the throne of France under the name of [[Louis Philippe I|Louis-Philippe Ier]]). It is part of a public park opened to the public (via the Solférino street).
* The ''school of artillery'', next to the ''Hôtel de la Motte-Sanguin'' which it is often confused with, formerly housing a military school, it was built in the 19th century near the [[Loire]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.orleans.fr/pratique/urbanisme-habitat/projets-urbains/la-motte-sanguin.htm?cHash= |title=La Motte Sanguin - Orleans.fr |access-date=2014-11-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416082813/http://www.orleans.fr/pratique/urbanisme-habitat/projets-urbains/la-motte-sanguin.htm?cHash= |archive-date=16 April 2015}}</ref>
* ''Remains of the [[University of Orléans]]'' (a 15th-century building housing the thesis room), founded in 1306 by [[pope Clement V]], in which, among many other great historical figures, the Protestant [[John Calvin]] studied and taught. The University was so famous that it attracted students from all over Europe, particularly Germany. The city of Orléans is one of the cradles of Protestantism.
* The ''House of Louis XI'' (end of the 15th century), on Saint-Aignan square. Built at the behest of the king, who particularly revered [[Aignan of Orleans|Saint Aignan]].<ref>J. DEBAL, Orléans : Une Ville, Une Histoire</ref>
* The ''House of Joan of Arc'', where she stayed during the [[siege of Orléans]] (this is actually an approximate reconstitution, the original building being bombed in 1940 during the [[Battle of France]]).
* ''Place du Martroi'', heart of the city, with the equestrian statue of [[Joan of Arc]] at its centre, made by [[Denis Foyatier]]. This statue was damaged during the Second World War, then repaired by [[Paul Belmondo]], father of the famous 1950s to 1980s French actor.
* Duke of Orléans' ''Chancellerie'' (XVIIIe), located next to the ''Place du Matroi'', also bombed during the Second World War, only the frontage resisted.
* The ''Bannier gate-house'', discovered in 1986 under the statue of [[Joan of Arc]] (Place du Martroi). It was built in the 14th century. It can be seen through a window in the subterranean car-park under the square, or visited under certain conditions.
* The ''rue de Bourgogne'' and surrounding streets, Orléans' main street since the Antiquity, it's the former Roman decumanus, crossing the city from east to west. [[Joan of Arc]] entered the city in 1429 by the "Bourgogne" gatehouse situated at its Easter end. Until today it is still giving access to the "Prefecture", where the "Prefet" (officer who represents the French State in the Region) lives, many pubs, night clubs, restaurants and shops such as the "Galeries Lafayette". It is more than a mile long. One can admire many medieval houses on its sides.
* The ''Tour Blanche / White Tower'', it is one of the only medieval defensive towers remaining in the city (still in use at the time of the [[siege of Orléans]]). It nowadays houses the city's archaeological department.
* ''The Docks'', ({{ill|Port of Orléans|fr|Port d'Orléans}}]) once the most important inland port of France (18th century). While boats could not sail on the river Seine because of the windings, they could sail to Orléans on the river Loire with the wind in their back. Then the merchandise was brought to Paris by roadways. Wine, and sugar from the colonies, were shipped to Orléans where they were stored and refined. Vinegar is still a city speciality due to the lapsing of wine stocks during the shipment. One can admire the old pavement of the docks (18th and 19th centuries) on the north bank of the river in the city and on the island in the middle, that was used to channel the water
* The ''Hôpital Madeleine'' (former hospital), built by [[King Louis XIV]] (18th century) and his successors (notably an important part of the 18th century).
* ''Saint-Charles'' chapel, located within the grounds of the Madeleine Hospital, it was built in 1713 by Jacques V Gabriel, one of Louis XIV's architects.
* The ''Hôtel Cabu'', otherwise named ''house of Diane de Poitiers'', built at the behest of Philippe Cabu, barrister, in 1547, famous architect Jacques Ier Androuet du Cerceau providing the plans.
* The ''Hôtel Hatte'', 16th century. Today's Charles-Péguy Center.
* The ''Hôtel Toutin'', 16th century
* The ''Hôtel Pommeret d'Orléans'', 16th century
* The ''Hôtel Ducerceau'', 16th century
*The ''maison de la coquille'', 16th century
* The ''Hôtel des Créneaux'', former city hall, flanked by its bell tower (15th century). It nowadays houses the city's school of music. This is a magnificent piece of late gothic secular architecture (15th century) that calls to mind the famous and much more recent Parisian city hall.
* The ''House of Jean Dalibert'', 16th century
* The ''Study of Jacques Bouchet'' (16th century), which can be admired from the public square "Jacques Bouchet"
* The mansions, rue d'Escure (17th and 18th centuries)
* The "Préfecture" : former Benedictine monastery, built in 1670 and housing the "Préfecture du Loiret" since 1800.
* The ''Pont de l'Europe'', designed by [[Santiago Calatrava Valls|Santiago Calatrava]], is an inclined bow-string ark bridge particularly original.
* The ''[[George V Bridge, Orléans|Pont Royal]] / George V Royal bridge'', the oldest bridge of the city. Built between 1751 and 1760, at the request of [[Daniel-Charles Trudaine]], administrator and civil engineer. It was renamed in honour of [[King George V]] after the [[World War I]] out of respect of [[British Empire in World War II|Britain's role in the war]].
* The ''Pont des Tourelles'', built in 1140 and demolished in 1760, was the first stone-made bridge of Orléans. When the river Loire is low, one can see remains of it in the water
* The ''Palais épiscopal d'Orléans'', former Bishop's Palace. It was built between 1635 and 1641. [[Napoleon|Napoléon]] stayed there. It is nowadays housing the international centre for research, part of [[University of Orléans]]. 
* The courthouse (18th to 20th centuries)
* The "''salle de l'Institut''", located on the "place Sainte Croix", is a small concert hall which can be converted into a ballroom. Its acoustics are remarkable.
* ''Mansions, rue de la Bretonnerie''. This street concentrates many particular mansions, of all styles and ages (15th to 20th centuries). High society members, politicians, barristers, doctors... continue to live there.
* ''Mansions, rue d'Alsace-Lorraine'', 19th-century bourgeoisie style houses.
* Statue ''La Baigneuse'' by Paul Belmondo, aside the rue Royale (1955).
* Statue of Calvin, by Daniel Leclercq, facing the Calvinist temple (2009).<ref>[http://www.bonnenouvelle.ch/20081112785/breves/les-francais-erigent-une-statue-de-calvin.html Les Français érigent une statue de Calvin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706222552/http://www.bonnenouvelle.ch/20081112785/breves/les-francais-erigent-une-statue-de-calvin.html |date=6 July 2011 }}, sur le site Bonnenouvelle.ch.</ref>

* Many historical houses and mansions (hundreds) can still be admired in the city centre, which is one of the largest in France due to the great importance of the city until the 20th century. The historical centre dating back to the 15th century extends far beyond the limits of the pedestrian sector that has been extensively restored in the past few years. In fact it corresponds to the portion of the modern city which is enclosed by the Boulevards. Many historical monuments remain in the non-pedestrian sectors of the city (for example, at rue Notre-Dame-de-Recouvrance, at rue des Carmes, at rue de la Bretonnerie, at Square Saint-Aignan).
