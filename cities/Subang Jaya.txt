==History==
Before 1974, what is today Subang Jaya was part of [[Klang, Malaysia|Klang District]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Malaysia, Malaya, Selangor 1950, Land Use, South Sheet, 1950, 1:126 720 |url=https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/140895 |access-date=22 October 2020}}</ref> Development on Subang Jaya began on 21 February 1976 and was concluded in 1988 by [[Sime UEP Properties Berhad]], the property development arm of the Malaysian conglomerate [[Sime Darby]]. The site was formerly a rubber plantation called Seafield Estate under the municipality of [[Petaling Jaya]]. Upon completion of Subang Jaya in the same year, Sime UEP began clearing land for the development of [[UEP Subang Jaya|USJ]]. In 1999, [[Sime Darby|Sime UEP]] began the development of [[Putra Heights]] which is located on the southern end of Subang Jaya.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In 1997, Subang Jaya received the status of a municipality, elevating the Petaling District Council to Subang Jaya Municipal Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dpu-projects/drivers_urb_change/urb_infrastructure/pdf_public_private_services/BestPractice_Subang_Jaya_Recycling_Centre_Malaysia.pdf|title=Subang Jaya Municipal Council Community Recycling Centre|publisher=University College London|access-date=10 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Background of MPSJ Establishment|url=https://ocps.mpsj.gov.my/cms/content.jsp?id=com.tms.cms.section.Section_ecda5e03-a020f414-4600c000-538f745f|website=OFFICIAL PORTAL OF MAJLIS PERBANDARAN SUBANG JAYA|access-date=28 January 2017}}</ref> The municipal comprise the areas administered by the former Petaling District Council, as well as some areas transferred from [[Petaling Jaya]], [[Puchong]] and [[Shah Alam]]. This means that the MPSJ municipal holds local government authority not only in the Subang Jaya city centre, but also [[UEP Subang Jaya|USJ]], [[Putra Heights]], [[Batu Tiga]], [[Bandar Sunway]], [[Puchong]], [[Bandar Kinrara]], [[Seri Kembangan]], and [[Balakong]]. In parliamentary terms, Subang Jaya's municipal area covers the parliamentary constituency of [[Puchong (federal constituency)|Puchong]] and [[Subang (federal constituency)|Subang]] in its entirety, as well as parts of [[Kota Raja (federal constituency)|Kota Raja]] which mainly cover Putra Heights.

Subang Jaya city itself lies within the Subang constituency, while Seri Kembangan and Puchong fall within the Puchong constituency. In December 2019, it was officially announced that Subang Jaya's municipality will be upgraded to a city council after a long 5-year wait since MPSJ's application in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=MPSJ to get city status, MDKL to get municipal status|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/metro/metro-news/2019/12/20/mpsj-to-get-city-status-mdkl-to-get-municipal-status|work=TheStar|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>

[[File:Persiaran Kewajipan, Subang Jaya & USJ.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Persiaran Kewajipan, with the Kelana Jaya LRT Line spanning over it.]]
Subang Jaya is well-connected to the cities of [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Shah Alam]] and the townships of [[Petaling Jaya]] such as [[Ara Damansara]], [[Kota Damansara]], [[Bandar Utama]], [[Damansara Utama]] and [[Mutiara Damansara]] via a network of major highways, namely the [[Federal Highway]], [[Shah Alam Expressway]] (KESAS), [[New Klang Valley Expressway|NKVE]], [[New Pantai Expressway|NPE]], [[North–South Expressway Central Link|North South Expressway]] and [[Damansara–Puchong Expressway|LDP]]. There are three exits connecting [[Federal Highway]] to Subang Jaya. The two main exits are at exit 17.9&nbsp;km through [[Persiaran Kewajipan]] and exit 18.2&nbsp;km through [[Persiaran Tujuan]], while the alternative exit is through Persiaran Teknologi Subang at Tropicana Metropark's direct interchange.

[[Persiaran Kewajipan]] and [[Persiaran Tujuan]] serve as the two major roads in Subang Jaya. The alternative route from [[UEP Subang Jaya|USJ]] and Subang Jaya to Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya is the [[Subang–Kelana Jaya Link]], which also connects the Persiaran Kewajipan roundabout of the [[New Pantai Expressway]] towards the [[Subang Airport]] expressway (route 15) of [[Federal Highway, Malaysia|Federal Highway]] [[Malaysia Federal Route 2|Federal Route 2]].

Subang Jaya's public transport system is highly developed, boasting 2 light rail transit (LRT) lines, 1 KTM commuter line, 1 BRT line, bus and taxi services. Since 30 June 2016, many new LRT stations of the extended [[Kelana Jaya Line]] have opened, connecting various areas in Subang Jaya with Kuala Lumpur city centre and [[Petaling Jaya]]. The LRT stations are strategically located within walking distance from shopping malls, commercial centres and residential areas and supported by feeder buses. The [[Kelana Jaya Line]] had been extended from the existing route from the Subang LRT Depot, running through the Dana 1 commercial centre in [[Kelana Jaya]], to Kelana Centre Point, then to [[Subang Parade]] (interchange with [[KTM]] Subang Jaya commuter station) which covers three stations within the town centre. Within USJ, the LRT line continues from SS18 to USJ 7 (Da Men and Summit), USJ Taipan, Wawasan (USJ 15), USJ 21 (One City and Main Place), and ends at the main interchange station hub in [[Putra Heights]], which connects with another LRT line, the [[Sri Petaling Line]] to [[Puchong]], [[Bukit Jalil]] and [[Sri Petaling]]. In addition, six [[Putrajaya line|MRT Putrajaya line]] stations are located in southern part of Subang Jaya City Council area serving [[Seri Kembangan]] and Serdang.

On the other hand, public bus transportation is provided by two companies, [[RapidKL]] and [[Metrobus Nationwide|Metrobus]]. These buses provide access around the town and also to Kuala Lumpur. Alternatively, there is a BRT line connecting the [[Setia Jaya Komuter station]] through [[Bandar Sunway]] to the [[USJ7 LRT Station]]. The [[BRT Sunway Line]] started operating on 1 June 2015, when it was officially launched by Malaysia prime minister, [[Najib Razak]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Anis|first=Mazwin|title=Najib launches BRT electric bus service in Sunway|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2015/06/01/Najib-BRT-Sunway-electric-bus-service/|access-date=7 June 2015|work=The Star|location=Malaysia|date=1 June 2015}}</ref> The BRT service is a public-private partnership project between Prasarana and Sunway Group which aims to provide eco-friendly electric bus services on elevated tracks for residents in Bandar Sunway and USJ.
