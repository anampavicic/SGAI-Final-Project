==History==
Archaeological excavation in this area proved that humans lived in what is now Quảng Bình province in the [[Stone Age]]. Many artifacts, such as ceramic vases, stone tools, and china, have been unearthed in Quảng Bình.<ref name="nuocnonhuyendieu">''Quảng Bình, Nuoc non huyen dieu'', Van Nghe Publishing House, 2000, pp. 14-17.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ejournal.anu.edu.au/index.php/bippa/article/viewFile/87/78|title=Evidence for Culture Development in Vietnam during the Middle Holocene|access-date=2008-03-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724012004/http://ejournal.anu.edu.au/index.php/bippa/article/viewFile/87/78|archive-date=2008-07-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1926, French archaeologist [[Madeleine Colani]] discovered and excavated many artifacts in caves and grottoes in west mountainous areas of Quảng Bình. She concluded that the [[Hoabinhian|Hòa Bình culture]] existed in this region. Through C14 testing, the artifacts dated back to 10,509 (plus or minus 950) years ago. From Quy Đạt township ([[Tuyên Hóa District]]) to south-west about 150 m, the Hum grotto contains many stone tools and animal stones from an ancient human community. Inside Khai grotto near the Quy Đạt township, similar artifacts were found, including ceramics from [[Đông Sơn culture]]. Additionally, artifacts of the Stone Age were unearthed in grottoes in the Quảng Bình region. Owners of these artifacts lived in the caves and grottoes and hunted for their food.<ref name="nuocnonhuyendieu"/>

Human settlement in Đồng Hới can be traced 5,000 years back. Many relics and remnants have been found in [[Bau Tro]], a lake in the city, most of which date to the [[Stone Age]]. Around  2880 BC, the site of modern Đồng Hới was a territory of the Viet Thuong tribe of [[Văn Lang]] during the reign of king [[Hùng Vương]]. The site was a long-disputed territory between the [[Champa|Champa kingdom]] and [[Đại Việt]]. It officially became Đại Việt territory in 1069 after [[Lý Thường Kiệt]] took victory over Champa as a result of the Đại Việt-Champa War (1069).

The area ceased to be the southernmost of Đại Việt following the political marriage of the [[Trần dynasty]] princess, [[Huyền Trân]], to Champa king, [[Jaya Sinhavarman III]] (Vietnamese: ''Chế Mân''). Princess Huyền Trân was king [[Trần Nhân Tông]]'s daughter and king Trần Anh Tông's younger sister. Political matches made to acquire land was a traditional practice by Champa kings. Thanks to this marriage, Đại Việt acquired lands (as dowry) of what is now [[Quảng Trị Province]] and [[Thừa Thiên–Huế Province]] (provinces which were then known respectively as Chau O and Chau Ri or Chau Ly).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/25734/h/history10.html |title=Trần Dynasty |access-date=2008-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303100535/http://library.thinkquest.org/25734/h/history10.html |archive-date=2008-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Kingdom of Champa|url=http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/549713|publisher=ancientworld|access-date=2008-03-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511081540/http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/549713|archive-date=2011-05-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>

During the time of the [[Trịnh–Nguyễn War]] (1558–1775), Vietnam was divided into two countries: Dang Trong (South) and Dang Ngoai (North) with the [[Gianh River]] as frontier line. Đồng Hới was an important fortress of the southern [[Nguyễn lords]]. The Đồng Hới Wall (Vietnamese: ''Thành Đồng Hới'') was considered the barrier that protected the Nguyễn lords from the attack by the northern [[Trịnh lords|Trịnh]] family.

During the [[First Indochina War]] (between the French and the [[Viet Minh]] in the 1950s), the Đồng Hới airbase was used by the French to attack the Viet Minh in north-central Vietnam and the Laotian [[Pathet Lao]] army in central and southern Laos. During the [[Vietnam War]], Đồng Hới was heavily devastated by bombardments from United States [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bombers]] due to its location near the [[17th parallel north|17th parallel]] and the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]] between [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110524153557/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/580550522.html?dids=580550522:580550522&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&date=Feb+08,+1965&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=U.+S.+Hits+Dong+Hoi+Again,+Russ+Say&pqatl=google U.

On February 11, 1965, bombing destroyed much of the city. The [[Tam Tòa Church]], a Catholic cathedral, was severely damaged. Today the bell tower remains near the town center as a monument.[[File:TamToa.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Tam Tòa Church]].]]
On 19 April 1972, during a major North Vietnam offensive, a task force of four US ships were sailing off the coast of Vietnam — {{USS|Oklahoma City|CLG-5|6}}, {{USS|Sterett|CG-31|6}}, {{USS|Lloyd Thomas|DD-764|6}} and {{USS|Higbee|DD-806|6}}. They were attacked by three North Vietnamese MiG aircraft in the [[Battle of Đồng Hới]]. In an attempt to surprise the task force, the MiGs came in low, described as "getting their feet wet." Despite the official stories, they did not surprise the task force, which had spotted them long before engagement range and were ready to shoot. Two ships, ''Oklahoma City'' and ''Sterett'', had anti-aircraft missiles, while ''Higbee'' and ''Lloyd Thomas'' were armed with dual purpose {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on|0}} guns. All ships were at battle stations.

This city is the narrowest land of Vietnam (around 40&nbsp;km from the east to the west). After the [[fall of Saigon]] on 30 April 1975, Quảng Bình province was merged into Bình Trị Thiên province (Bình Trị Thiên is the abbreviation of Quảng Bình, Quảng Trị, and Thừa Thiên provinces). In 1990, Bình Trị Thiên was once again separated into three provinces as it had been before. Đồng Hới then became the capital of Quảng Bình province.

==Geography==
===Location===
[[File:Donghoi3.jpg|thumb|Đồng Hới seen from the air]]

Đồng Hới is on the National Route 1, North–South Railway, and [[Ho Chi Minh Highway]], at the coordinates 17 21' N and 106 10’ E. This city is in the heart of Quảng Bình Province. It borders [[Bố Trạch]] on the north, [[Quảng Ninh District|Quảng Ninh]] on the south, the [[South China Sea]] on the east and [[Quảng Ninh District|Quảng Ninh]] on the west. It is 50&nbsp;km south of [[Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park]], 50&nbsp;km north of [[Bang Spa]], 180&nbsp;km south-east of Cha Lo border gate with Laos. It has a coastline of 12&nbsp;km. [[Nhật Lệ River]] is the only river that runs through the city. [[Bàu Tró|Tro Lake]] is the source of fresh water. The [[Nhật Lệ Beach]] is endowed with fine and white sand.<ref name="quangbinh"/>

===Transportation===
There are many ways to get to Dong Hoi from Hue, such as local bus at Hue North Bus Station. There are taxis from city center bus station (6&nbsp;km). The bus fare is around $8. It takes 3.5 hours to drive to Dong Hoi/Quang Binh Town.

==Climate==
Like all provinces in [[Northern Vietnam|north]] and north central Vietnam, there are four distinct seasons in Đồng Hới. Despite these distinct seasons, and an annual temperature range of {{convert|10.8|C-change|F-change|1|disp=or}}, Đồng Hới still has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Am'') as the mean temperature of the coolest month is {{convert|18.8|C|F|1|disp=or}}. The average annual temperature is {{convert|24.7|C|F|disp=or}}, average rainfall varies from {{convert|1,300|to|4,000|mm|in|-1|disp=or}}, total sunshine hours per year is 1,783 hours, and average annual humidity is around 82%. The city sees three types of wind: south-east (gió nồm), south-west (gió Lào), and north-east.

In the “spring”, Đồng Hới is very warm, humid and foggy. Although the city is by the sea, its climate is subject to drought and heat in the summer. This is largely due to the dry south-west wind from [[Gulf of Thailand]]. This flow of wind is wet but when it passes onto Vietnam, the [[Annamite Range]] releases its moisture to cause rains in Laos but drought in central Vietnam. It is rainy in the northeast monsoon (“fall”) and the weather is very warm ({{convert|26|to|31|C|F|1|disp=or}}) although with extremely high relative humidity due to the moist air from the northeast monsoon. In the winter, due to the north-east wind blowing from the [[Siberia]]  mainland, the temperature may go down below {{convert|18|C|F|1|disp=or}}, and there may be slight rain. The highest rainfall occurs in October ({{convert|649|mm|in|1|disp=or}}), compared to just {{convert|39|mm|in|1|disp=or}} in Februarys. The highest temperature recorded was 43.2&nbsp;°C on 30 April 2024, while the lowest was 6.7&nbsp;°C on 24 January 2016.

===Topography and geology===
The city has diverse topographical and geological features, including hill, mountainous, half mountainous, coastal plains and coastal sand dunes.

The hilly region is in the west, stretching from north to south (in parts of communes: Dong Son, Thuan Duc) with an average elevation of 12–15 m, with total area of 64.93&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, 41.7% of the city total area. Residents here live on agriculture, forestry, farming. The soil in this area is poor in nutrition, infertile and subject to continuous erosion due to its slope of 7-10%.

The half hilly region surrounds a plain with an average elevation of 10 m from north-east - north to north-west – south-west and south – south-east.{{clarify|date=November 2015}} This region covers commues and wards of Bắc Lý, Nam Lý, Nghĩa Ninh, Bắc Nghĩa, Đức Ninh, Đức Ninh Đông, Lộc Ninh and Phú Hải with total area of 62.87&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, or accounts for 40.2% of the city total area. Residents here lives on industrial, handcraft, trading and a small percentage lives on farming. This region is not very fertile, subject to alum. However, thanks to the heavy distribution of rivers and lakes, ponds and pools, it's better for agriculture than the hilly region. The plain with the average of 2.1 m, with little slope, accounting for 0.2% of the city area (5.76&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). Most of the city's commercial, administrative and main streets concentrate in this narrow regions. Coastal sand dune area is on the east of the city, with an area of 21.98&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, making up 14,3% of the total area.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
