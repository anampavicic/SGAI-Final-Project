archaeologists have discovered the sites, where they found{{where|date=January 2021}} a small building whose walls were inscribed with human and animal drawings, suggesting that the building was used as a religious site. The people who inhabited the site had developed an extensive water system in irrigating their crops which were mostly made up of grapes, olives and wheat. Several different-sized clay pots were also found suggesting that copper production was a major industry in the region, the pots being used in melting the copper and reshaping it. Scientific studies performed on-site revealed that it had undergone two earthquakes, with the latter one leaving the site completely destroyed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.alghad.com/articles/722736-%D8%A7%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A3%D8%AB%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AA%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%AD%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%B2%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%82%D8%A8%D8%A9|access-date=22 April 2016|date=18 February 2008|title=اكتشافات أثرية في موقع حجيرة الغزلان بوادي اليتيم في جنوب الأردن|work=Alghad|language=ar|archive-date=5 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305002959/http://www.alghad.com/articles/722736-%D8%A7%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A3%D8%AB%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AA%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%AD%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%B2%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%82%D8%A8%D8%A9|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Early history===
====Elath====
{{further|Elath}}
The [[Edom]]ites, who ruled over [[Edom]] just south of the [[Dead Sea]], are believed to have built the first port in Aqaba called [[Elath]] around 1500 BC,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} turning it into a major hub for the trade of copper as the [[Phoenicia]]ns helped them develop their maritime economy. They profited from its strategic location at the junction of trading routes between Asia and Africa.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

====Tell el-Kheleifeh====
Archaeologists have investigated an [[Iron Age]] settlement at [[Tell el-Kheleifeh]], immediately west of Aqaba, inhabited between the 8th and 4th centuries BCE.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Aqaba|url=https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/a4add4d1482149d787fa5b7c8d9b2de2|access-date=2020-11-24|website=ArcGIS StoryMaps|language=en|archive-date=15 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210315231533/https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/a4add4d1482149d787fa5b7c8d9b2de2|url-status=live}}</ref>

Around 735 BC, the city{{dubious|Which? Kheleifeh? Goes for the entire paragraph. Was there one city north of the golf? Two? Which archaeological sites have remains from the time?|date=January 2021}} was conquered by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian empire]]. Because of the wars the Assyrians were fighting in the east, their trading routes were diverted to the city and the port witnessed relative prosperity. The [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonians]] conquered it in 600 BC. During this time, Elath witnessed great economic growth, which is attributed to the business background of its rulers who realized how important the city's location was. The Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] took the city in 539 BC.<ref name="AQABA">{{cite web|url=http://www.aqaba.jo/en/aqaba/beach-of-history#page|title=The Beach of History (3700 BC to date)|work=aqaba.jo|publisher=AQABA|access-date=27 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928032739/http://www.aqaba.jo/en/aqaba/beach-of-history#page|archive-date=28 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=May 2018}}{{dubious|Unaccebtably poor source, useless, faulty and against Wikipedia standards.|date=January 2021}}

Both Petra and Aela were under strong [[Nabatean]] influence despite the Roman rule.{{dubious|When? After 106 Nabataea itself became a Roman province. Before?

One of the oldest known texts written in the [[Arabic alphabet]] is a late 4th-century inscription found in [[Jabal Ram]] {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=off}} east of Aqaba.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fweY0lTEJogC&pg=PA33|page=33|title=Treks and Climbs in Wadi Rum, Jordan|isbn=978-1-85284-254-3|author1=Di Taylor|author2=Tony Howard|publisher=Cicerone Press Limited|year=1997|access-date=19 September 2017|archive-date=26 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200726073421/https://books.google.com/books?id=fweY0lTEJogC&pg=PA33|url-status=live}}</ref>

The city became a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[bishopric]] at an early stage. Its bishop Peter was present at the [[First Council of Nicaea]],<ref>Irfan Shahid, Byzantium and the Arabs in the Fourth Century (Dumbarton Oaks, 1984) page 345.</ref> the first [[ecumenical council]], in 325. Beryllus was at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, and Paul at [[Council of Jerusalem (536)|the synod]] called by [[Patriarch Theophilus I of Jerusalem|Patriarch Peter of Jerusalem]] in 536 against [[Coptic Church of Alexandria|Patriarch Anthimus I of Alexandria]], a council attended by bishops of the Late [[Roman province]]s of [[Palaestina Prima]], [[Palaestina Secunda]] and [[Palaestina Tertia]], to the last-named of which Aela belonged.<ref>Siméon Vailhé, v.

A citadel was also built in the area{{where|date=January 2021}}{{when|date=January 2021}} that became the focal point of the Roman southern defense system.{{clarify|date=May 2018}}

In the 6th century, [[Procopius of Caesarea]] mentioned a Jewish population in Eilat and its surroundings which enjoyed autonomy until the time of [[Justinian I]] ({{Reign|527|565}}).{{clarify|date=May 2018}}

According to [[Ibn Ishaq]], [[Muhammad]] himself reached Aila during the [[expedition of Tabuk]] of 630, and extracted tribute from the city.<ref>Francis E.

During the Late Byzantine or even Early Muslim period, Aila was the origin of what came to be known as the [[Ayla-Axum amphoras]].<ref>M. Raith – R. Hoffbauer – H. Euler – P. Yule – K.

===Early Muslim period===
Aila fell to the [[Islamic conquest of the Levant|Islamic armies]] by 629, and the ancient settlement was left to decay, while a new Arab city was established outside its walls under [[Uthman ibn Affan]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago – Aqaba Project|url=http://oi.uchicago.edu/research/projects/aqa/|work=Aqaba project|publisher=The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago|access-date=7 May 2018|archive-date=4 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104204035/http://oi.uchicago.edu/research/projects/aqa/|url-status=live}}</ref> known as ''Ayla'' ({{langx|ar|آيلا}}).

The Early Muslim city was excavated in 1986 by a team from the [[University of Chicago]]. Artefacts are now on exhibit at [[Aqaba Archaeological Museum]] and [[Jordan Archaeological Museum]] in [[Amman]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The fortified city was inscribed in a rectangle of 170 × 145 meters, with walls 2.6 meters thick and 4.5 meters high, surrounding a fortified structure, occupying an area of 35 × 55 meters.{{dubious|It makes no sense. What were the dimensions of the fortified area, 170x145 or 35x35 m? Certainly the former. I guess it's a confusion with the Late Muslim fort. Or did Ayla also have a citadel inside the fortified city? Very unlikely.|date=January 2021}}{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} 24 towers defended the city. The city had four gates on all four sides, defining two main lines intersecting at the centre. The intersection of these two thoroughfares was indicated by a [[tetrapylon]] (a four-way arch), which was later transformed into a luxury residential building decorated with frescoes dated to the tenth century.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} This type of urban structure, called MSIR,{{clarify|date=May 2018}} is typical of early Islamic fortified settlements.

The city prospered from 661 to 750 under the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] and beyond under the [[Abbasids]] (750–970) and the [[Fatimids]] (970–1116). Ayla took advantage of its key position as an important step on the road to [[India]] and Arab spices (frankincense, myrrh), between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The city is also mentioned in several stories of the [[Arabian Nights]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The geographer [[Al-Muqaddasi|Shams Eddin Muqaddasi]] describes Ayla as nearby the ruined ancient city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alrai.com/article/357602.html|title=حفريات أثرية.. العقبة منطقة اقتصادية منذ 6 آلاف سنة|access-date=28 September 2015|date=10 July 2009|work=Al-Rai Newspaper|archive-date=18 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018082807/http://www.alrai.com/article/357602.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Crusader/Ayyubid and Mamluk periods===
[[File:Aqaba Fort.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Aqaba Fortress|Muslim fortress of Aqaba]]]]

[[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]] took over the city in 1115 without encountering much resistance. The centre of the city then moved to 500 meters along the coast to the south, and the crusader fortress of ''Elyn'' was built, which allowed the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] to dominate all roads between [[Damascus]], [[Fatimid Caliphate|Egypt]], and [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], protecting the [[Crusader states]] from the east and allowing for profitable raids on trade caravans passing through the area. In order to secure this strategic position, Baldwin also built and garrisoned a fortress on [[Pharaoh's Island]] (called ''Île de Graye'' by the Franks), the modern ''Jazīrat Fir'aun'' in [[Egypt]]ian territorial waters about {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=off}} west of Aqaba.<ref name="auto"/>

The garrison of Elyn (now serving primarily as a military outpost) was further strengthened in 1142 by [[Pagan the Butler]], [[Oultrejourdain|Lord of Oultrejourdain]], who pursued an ambitious program of castle building throughout his domain. However, there was no large-scale settlement of Europeans in the area, and the region between the [[Dead Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] remained mainly inhabited by Bedouins, who were obliged to pay tribute to the Lordship of Oultrejourdain.<ref>{{cite book | author = Steven Runciman | title = A History of the Crusades: The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Frankish East 1100-1187| volume = 2 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | page = 186| year = 1952}}</ref> Despite all efforts to fortify the region, the city was captured in 1170 by a squadron sent by [[Saladin]] as he was besieging [[Gaza City|Gaza]]; while it was successfully raided by [[Raynald of Châtillon]] in 1182,<ref>{{cite book | author = Steven Runciman | title = A History of the Crusades: The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Frankish East 1100-1187| volume = 2 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | page = 318| year = 1952}}</ref> it was never retaken by the Crusaders.<ref>{{cite book | author = Steven Runciman | title = A History of the Crusades: The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Frankish East 1100-1187| volume = 2 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | pages = 356–357| year = 1952}}</ref>

The old fort was rebuilt, as [[Aqaba Fortress]], by [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] sultan [[Al-Ashraf Qansuh Al-Ghuri]] in the early 16th century. For the next four centuries, the site was a simple fishing village of little importance.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

===Modern history===
During World War I, the Ottoman forces were forced to withdraw from Aqaba in 1917 after the [[Battle of Aqaba]], led by [[T. E. Lawrence]] and the Arab forces of [[Auda Abu Tayi]] and [[Nasir ibn Ali ibn Hussein|Sherif Nasir]]. The capture of Aqaba allowed the British to supply the Arab forces.<ref name="clio"/> In 1918, the regions of Aqaba and Ma'an were officially incorporated into the [[Kingdom of the Hejaz]]. In 1925, [[Ibn Saud]] the ruler of [[Nejd]] with the help of his Wahhabi [[Ikhwan]] troops successfully annexed the Hejaz, but gave up the Ma'an and Aqaba to the British [[protectorate]] of [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_transjordan.html|title=Jordan - History - the Making of Transjordan|access-date=25 February 2019|archive-date=21 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921111449/http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_transjordan.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Geography==
The city lies at Jordan's southernmost point, on the Gulf of Aqaba lying at the tip of the Red Sea. Its strategic location is shown in the fact that it is located at the crossroads of the continents of Asia and Africa, while bordering Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aqaba.jo/en/node/1410|title=Location|work=aqaba.jo|access-date=1 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929215928/http://www.aqaba.jo/en/node/1410|archive-date=29 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Climate===
Aqaba has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh'') with mild, sometimes warm winters and very hot dry summers. Subzero temperatures can be observed every few years. The record low temperature of {{convert|-3.9|C}} was on January 16, 2008, as in [[Eilat]].

==Local government==
In August 2000, the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority ([[ASEZA]]) was established which acted as the statutory institution empowered with administrative, fiscal, regulatory and economic responsibilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aqabazone.com |title=Aseza |publisher=Aqabazone.com |access-date=17 October 2011 |archive-date=5 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705121454/http://www.aqabazone.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Administrative divisions===
Jordan is divided into 12 administrative divisions, each called a [[Governorate]]. [[Aqaba Governorate]] divides into 3 [[Nahias of Jordan|Districts]], some of which are divided into Subdistricts and further divided into villages.

==Economy==
[[File:Z Aqaba Beatch JO.jpg|thumb|right|View of Aqaba]]

[[File:Red Sea Summit in Aqaba.jpg|thumb|220px|The Red Sea Summit in Aqaba in 2003.]]
Benefiting from its location and status as Jordan's special economic zone, Aqaba's economy is based on the tourism and port industry sectors.<ref name="Ad Dustour"/><ref name="worldfolio"/> The economic growth in Aqaba is higher than the average economic growth in the country.  Under the special economic zone status some investments and trades are exempted from taxation, as a result, new resorts, housing developments, and retail outlets are being constructed.  New projects such as Tala Bay and Saraya al Aqaba are constructed aiming at providing high-end vacation and residential homes to locals and foreigners alike.

Aqaba's location next to [[Wadi Rum]] and [[Petra]] has placed it in Jordan's golden triangle of tourism, which strengthened the city's location on the world map and made it one of the major tourist attractions in Jordan.<ref name="UEFA"/> The city is administered by the [[Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority]], which has turned Aqaba into a low-tax, duty-free city, attracting several mega projects like [[Ayla Oasis]], [[Saraya Aqaba]], [[Marsa Zayed]] and expansion of the Port of Aqaba.<ref name="king checks"/> They are expected to turn the city into a major tourism hub in the region.<ref name="yourmiddleast"/> However, industrial and commercial activities remain important, due to the strategic location of the city as the country's only [[seaport]].<ref name="Jean"/>

Over US$20 billion have been invested in Aqaba since 2001 when the Special Economic Zone was established. Along with tourism projects, Aqaba has also attracted global logistic companies such as APM Terminals and Agility to invest in logistics, which boosted the city's status as a transport and logistics hub. There are numerous hotels that reside in Aqaba but new hotels are also under construction.

Aqaba is the only seaport of Jordan so virtually all of Jordan's exports depart from here.  Heavy machinery industry is also flourishing in the city with regional assembly plants being located in Aqaba such as the [[Land Rover Aqaba Assembly Plant]]. 
By 2008 the ASEZ had attracted $18bn in committed investments, beating its $6bn target by 2020 by a third and more in less than a decade. The goal was adjusted to bring in another $12bn by 2020, but in 2009 alone, deals worth $14bn were inked.<ref name="oxfordbusinessgroup.com">[http://www.oxfordbusinessgroup.com/publication.asp?country=19] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829151238/http://www.oxfordbusinessgroup.com/publication.asp?country=19|date=29 August 2009}}</ref> Some projects currently under construction are:

* [[Marsa Zayed]] a $10 billion is the largest mega mixed-use development project ever envisioned in both Jordan and the region. Marsa Zayed will host facilities including residential neighborhoods, commercial outlets and amenities, entertainment venues, financial and business facilities, and a number of hotels. Additionally, the property will feature marinas and a cruise ship terminal. Marsa Zayed will encompass 6.4 million square meters of built-up property. 
*[[Saraya Aqaba]], a $1.5 billion resort with a man made lagoon, luxury hotels, villas, and townhouses that will be completed by 2017.{{update inline|date=April 2021}}
* [[Ayla Oasis]], a $1.5 billion resort around a man made lagoon with hotels, villas, an 18-hole golf course designed by [[Greg Norman]].  It also has an Arabian Venice theme with apartment buildings built along canals only accessible by walkway or boat. This project will be completed by 2017.
*Tala Bay, Tala Bay was developed in a distinctive architectural style that blends Jordanian and regional architecture with total cost of US$680 million.  Another distinguishing feature of this single community resort is its two-kilometer private sandy beach on the Red Sea.
*[[The Red Sea Astrarium (TRSA)]], the world's only Star Trek themed park, worth $1.5&nbsp;billion would have been completed by 2014 but cancelled in 2015. 
*Port relocation. Aqaba's current port will be relocated to the southernmost part of the province near the Saudi border. Its capacity will surpass that of the current port.  The project costs $5&nbsp;billion, and it will be completed by 2013.
*Aqaba will be connected by the national rail system which will be completed by 2013.  The rail project will connect Aqaba with all Jordan's main cities and economic centers and several countries like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Syria.
*The Aqaba Container Terminal (ACT) handled a record 587,530 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in 2008, an increase of 41.6% on the previous year. To accommodate the rise in trade on the back of the increasing popularity of container shipping and the stabilising political situation in Iraq, the Aqaba Development Corporation (ADC) has announced plans for a new port. The port relocation {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=off}} to the south will cost an estimated $600m and will improve infrastructure, while freeing up space for development in the city. Plans for upgrading the King Hussein International Airport (KHIA) and the development of a logistics centre will also help position Aqaba as a regional hub for trade and transport.<ref name="oxfordbusinessgroup.com"/>
