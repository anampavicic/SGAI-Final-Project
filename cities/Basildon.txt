'''Basildon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|z|ᵻ|l|d|ən}} {{respell|BAZ|il|dən}}) is a town in  [[Borough of Basildon|the borough of the same name]], in the county of [[Essex]], [[England]]. It had a recorded population of 115,955 at the [[2021 United Kingdom census|2021 census]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Towns and cities, characteristics of built-up areas, England and Wales: Census 2021 |url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/datasets/townsandcitiescharacteristicsofbuiltupareasenglandandwalescensus2021 |access-date=22 December 2023 |website=[[Office for National Statistics]]}}</ref> In 1931, the town had a population of 1,159.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10234591/cube/TOT_POP|title=Population statistics Basildon Ch/CP through time|publisher=[[A Vision of Britain through Time]]|accessdate=27 December 2021}}</ref>

The local government district of Basildon, which was formed in 1974 and received [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]] status in 2010, encapsulates a larger area than the town itself; the two neighbouring towns of Billericay and Wickford, as well as rural villages and smaller settlements set among the surrounding countryside, fall within its borders. Basildon Town is one of the most densely populated areas in the county. The parish of Basildon was abolished to create Billericay on 1 January 1937.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10234591|title=Relationships and changes Basildon Ch/CP through time|publisher=A Vision of Britain through Time|accessdate=27 December 2021}}</ref>

Some of Basildon's residents work in Central London, due to the town being well connected in the county to the [[City of London]] and the Docklands financial and corporate headquarters districts, with a 36–58 minute journey from the three Basildon stations on the [[c2c]] to [[Fenchurch Street Station|London Fenchurch Street]].<ref>[http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/planjourney/search Association of Train Operating Companies] National Rail enquiries</ref> Basildon also has access to the City via road, on the A127 and A13.

==History==

The first historical reference to Basildon is in records from 1086. It is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] as 'Belesduna'.<ref>{{cite web | title = National Archive Summary Record for Basildon | publisher = nationalarchives.gov.uk |date=November 2006 | url = http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7568162&queryType=1&resultcount=1

Railway service started in the 19th century to Pitsea (1856) and Laindon (1888) but it was only later that proposals to provide service to the new town of Basildon, shelved for many years because of concerns that it would simply become a commuter suburb of London, were eventually forced through. A significant number of modern-day residents do commute to London.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://londondatastore-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/Zho%3Dttw-flows.pdf|title=Commuting in London CIS 2014-11 - GLA Intelligence p.July 2014|access-date=26 November 2018}}</ref>

By the beginning of the 1900s, Basildon had evolved with much of the land having been sold in small plots during a period of land speculation and development taking placed haphazardly with building by plot owners ranging from shelters created from recycled materials to brick-built homes and with amenities such as water, gas, electricity and hard-surfaced roads lacking.<ref name="EL1108">{{cite news|title=Once upon a time in ...

==Transport==

===Road===
[[File:Mayne roads.jpg|thumb|right|Schematic of 'Mayne' roads]]
The two main roads from London to Southend, the [[A13 road (England)|A13]] and [[A127 road|A127]], pass to the south and north of the town respectively. Both are important commuter trunk roads, allowing easy access to the [[M25 motorway|M25]] and the rest of the motorway network. Locally, the A13 gives access to Pitsea and Vange; the A127 gives access to [[Basildon town centre|the town centre]] and Laindon.

Within the town are six main roads which link to and from the A13 and A127; all of them include the word 'Mayne' in their names.

* Nether Mayne runs from the town centre to the A13 at Five Bells junction, just west of Vange.
* Upper Mayne runs from the town centre to the A127 in the north-east corner of Laindon. Both this road and Nether Mayne form part of the A176, which continues north to Billericay.
* South Mayne runs from [[Northlands Park, Basildon|Northlands Park]] to the A13 at Pitsea.
* East Mayne runs from Northlands Park to the A127 near Noke Wood. Both this road and South Mayne form part of the A132, which continues north to Wickford.
* Broadmayne runs from the town centre to Northlands Park, connecting the four aforementioned roads. It forms the A1321.
* West Mayne runs from the centre of Laindon to the A127 at [[Dunton Wayletts]]. It forms part of the B148, which continues east from Laindon to Upper Mayne.

===Rail===
The town has three stations on the [[London, Tilbury and Southend line]]: [[Pitsea railway station|Pitsea]], [[Basildon railway station|Basildon]] and [[Laindon railway station|Laindon]]. All are served by [[c2c]] trains running between [[Fenchurch Street railway station|Fenchurch Street]] and [[Southend Central railway station|Southend]]/[[Shoeburyness railway station|Shoeburyness]]; trains serving Basildon and Laindon stations run via [[Upminster station|Upminster]].

===Bus===
Most bus services are provided by [[First Essex]] which connect Basildon to Billericay, Wickford and other nearby towns. Other providers are [[Stephensons of Essex]] and [[NIBS Buses]].

As part of Basildon's redevelopment [[Essex County Council]] had proposed that the A127 undergo significant development at a cost of £15 million, which was expected to be finished by March 2011. It was funded via the [[Community Infrastructure Fund]] (CIF). The project was completed and was divided into three sections:
* '''Section 1''' – Eastmayne. Implementation of an additional lane northbound (600 metres approx.) and new drainage and footpath realignment.
* '''Section 2''' – Cranes Farm Road. Included dualling of the existing carriageway of which was already there (approx. 1500m) and enhancing and upgrading junctions – with the creation of a dedicated left turn lane at the roundabout at Eastmayne to help ease traffic flows during busy hours at the junction.
* '''Section 3''' – Introduction of a new A176 junction at Pipps Hill. This included upgrading the east and westbound off slips to increase the capacity of vehicles and ease traffic flows. The implementation of queue detection and advanced warning signs was also added to this section of the road.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ceequal.com/case-studies/basildon-enterprise-corridor/|title=A127 Basildon Enterprise Corridor|date=8 March 2016|publisher=Carillion Civil Engineering|access-date=21 March 2017}}</ref> Part of section 3 also saw the introduction of the new ''Hollywood'' sign for Basildon at the A176 junction.

===Art===
Basildon was the focus of ''Magic Party Place'' by photographer [[CJ Clarke]]. "{{sic|Comprising |hide=y|of}} a largely white working class community, the town is one of the most statistically average places in England", he said.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/sep/30/cj-clarke-magic-party-place-basildon-photography|title=''Welcome to Basildon: the middle of Middle England – in pictures'' - The Guardian p.30 September 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 September 2016|access-date=26 November 2018}}</ref>

=== Poetry and literature ===
Caron Freeborn, (previously Severn),  (1966–2019) author, poet and performer, grew up in Basildon<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.duendeliterary.org/steve-armitage-caron-freeborn|title=What the neighbourhood came to|website=Duende Literacy|date=February 2014}}</ref> and attended Fryerns Comprehensive. Later she attended Lucy Cavendish college at Cambridge as a mature student, then as a teacher/lecturer in creative writing including poetry. Freeborn obtained her master's degree in Renaissance literature. She published three novels: ''Three Blind Mice'' (2001), described by Marian Keyes as "a dark and compelling love story of a genre that could be called East End noir"; ''Prohibitions'' (2004), a literary thriller again set in the East End; and ''Presenting … the Fabulous O'Learys'' (2017), a take on ''King Lear'', updated to the 1980s. ''Georges Perec is my hero'' (2015) showcased Freeborn's poetic voice(s). Much of ''Georges Perec is my hero'' celebrates the real, the brutal (including embracing the brutalist architecture of Basildon), with many poems and photographs based on the town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/english/caron-freeborn-1966-2020-an-appreciation/|title=Caron Freeborn (1966-2020): an appreciation|website=Open University|date=11 March 2020}}</ref>

St. Martin's Church in Basildon town centre is a modern structure. The church was consecrated in 1962 by the Bishop of Chelmsford.  A freestanding glass bell tower was built in 1999 and opened by Queen [[Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stmartinsbasildon.co.uk/around-the-church/|title=St Martins of Tours &#124; Around the Church|website=www.stmartinsbasildon.co.uk}}</ref>

Although there are a number of tall buildings in central Basildon, there are also many newly constructed buildings closer to the 'Basildon Enterprise Corridor' situated in North Basildon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.essex.gov.uk/Environment%20Planning/Planning/Transport-planning/Travel-improvements/Documents/BEC%20Final%20for%20printing.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913171058/http://www.essex.gov.uk/Environment%20Planning/Planning/Transport-planning/Travel-improvements/Documents/BEC%20Final%20for%20printing.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Planning Dept|archivedate=13 September 2014}}</ref>

The largest structure in the new town's town centre is Brooke House, a 14-story residential tower block that fronts the west side of the town centre's East Square. Dating from 1962, it was designed by Sir Basil Spence and Anthony B. Davies, with [[Arup Group Limited|Ove Arup and Partners]] as the structural engineers.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141014004129/http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/default.aspx?pid=2&id=472020 English Heritage, listing information for Brooke House]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ribapix.com/index.php?a=indexes&s=item&key=IYToxOntpOjA7czo3OiJQaWxvdGlzIjt9&pg=137 |title=Royal Institute of British Architects |website=www.ribapix.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014013205/http://www.ribapix.com/index.php?a=indexes&s=item&key=IYToxOntpOjA7czo3OiJQaWxvdGlzIjt9&pg=137 |archive-date=14 October 2014}}</ref> It has a 1960s [[Brutalist]] design, elevated on eight massive V-shaped concrete pylons. The building was chosen to have a residential function, as opposed to commercial office space, to retain life in the town centre after the shops had closed. Shops were positioned to the rear of the building, with Brooke House acting as a covered forecourt. It was conceived as a structure to define Basildon's urban status and to act as marker to identify the town centre's location within a largely low-rise settlement set in a flat landscape.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{Cite web |url=http://www.basildon.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=4474&p=0 |title=Jennie Humphrey, "Basildon Town Centre Heritage Assessment", 2012 |access-date=13 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213819/http://www.basildon.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=4474&p=0 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was named after the then Minister of Housing and Local Government, Henry Brooke MP. The building was given Grade II listing in 1998.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1271497|desc=Brooke House, Basildon |access-date=4 December 2018}}</ref>

East of Brooke House is East Square, a sunken open-air public plaza accessed from Brooke House by a monumental staircase and a curved ramp which was listed in 1998 as Grade II.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1271498|desc=Retaining Walls, Ramp, Steps, Bench and raised paving |access-date=4 December 2018}}</ref>  Formerly the east side of the square was fronted by Freedom House, containing shops on two levels, and the north side by the Post Office building, a 5-story structure. Formerly on the wall of Freedom House is the oldest piece of public sculpture in the new town: installed in 1957, it is a wire and aluminium relief by the sculptor [[John Poole (sculptor)|A. J. Poole]] titled ''Man Aspires''.<ref>"Our Basildon, exploring past, present and future, heritage trail", http://www.visitessex.com/discover/cultural/Basildon_Heritage_Trail.aspx</ref><ref>George Thorpe, "Treble Clef's 54-year secret solved at last", ''The Echo'', 5 January 2011. [http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/8770053.Treble_Clef___s_54_year_secret_solved_at_last/]</ref> The whole ensemble was designed to create a formal setting for Brooke House, and had a similar Brutalist design, though softened by other architectural features. Freedom House was demolished, along with the Post Office building as part of the new cinema construction in 2019.<ref name=cinema/> The town centre extends from East Square towards the south-west. Down the middle of this zone runs a rectangular raised pool. Within the pool is a bronze sculpture and fountain, titled "Mother and Child", by the sculptor [[Maurice Lambert]] and dating from 1959<ref name="ReferenceB"/> which was listed as Grade II in 1998.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1271562|desc=Raised Pool and Sculpture |access-date=4 December 2018}}</ref>

On the upper level of Eastgate is the Cats Cradle Pussiwillow III Clock. It was created by [[Rowland Emett]] in 1981 and was originally placed outside what is now ASDA on the Lower Mall of the shopping centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/essexrunner/4907817938/ |title=Basildon Eastgate &#124; Flickr - Photo Sharing! |website=Flickr.com |date=19 August 2010 |access-date=31 December 2015}}</ref> It was officially unveiled by [[Michael Bentine]].

The Barstable School building first opened on 1 March 1962 and was designed by the Finnish architect Cyril Leonard Sjöström Mardall (of [[Yorke Rosenberg Mardall|YRM Architects]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-architect.com/architects/yrm|title=YRM Architects, Architecture Practice|first=David|last=McManus|date=10 February 2010|website=e-architect}}</ref> [[F. R. S. Yorke|Yorke]], Rosenberg and Mardall). The building was listed in 1993 and is Grade II listed.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1235004|desc=Barstable School |access-date=4 December 2018}}</ref> It is now home to the lower school of the [[Basildon Academies]].
