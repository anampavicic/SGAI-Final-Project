The history of Semarang goes back to the 9th century, when it was known as Bergota. At the end of the 15th century, an Arab named {{Interlanguage link multi|Ki Ageng Pandan Arang|lt=Ki Ageng Pandan Arang|id|Ki Ageng Pandan Arang}} founded a village and an Islamic school in this fishing village. On 2 May 1547, [[Joko Tingkir|Sultan Hadiwijaya]] of [[Kingdom of Pajang|Pajang]] declared Pandan Arang as the first bupati (mayor) of Semarang, thus creating Semarang administratively and politically.

In 1678, Sunan [[Amangkurat II]] promised to give control of Semarang to the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) as a part of a debt payment.<ref name="EVNI 1919 740-4">{{cite book |editor1-last=Stibbe |editor1-first=D.

On 5 October 1705 after years of occupations, Semarang officially became a VOC city when Susuhunan [[Pakubuwono I]] made a deal to give extensive trade rights to the VOC in exchange of wiping out [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]]'s debt. The VOC, and later, the [[Dutch East Indies]] government, established [[tobacco]] plantations in the region and built roads and railroads, making Semarang an important colonial trading centre. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The historic presence of a large Indo (Eurasian) community in the area of Semarang is also reflected by the fact a creole mix language called [[Javindo]] existed there.<ref>De Gruiter, Miel. "''Javindo, a contact language in pre-war Semarang''". (Peter Bakker & Maarten Mous. Mixed Languages: 15 Case Studies in Language Intertwining. Amsterdam: IFOTT. 1994.) pp. 151–159.</ref>

=== Classical Indische Town (1678–1870) ===
[[File:AMH-4658-NA Map of the fort at Samarang.jpg|thumb|left|The early VOC settlement of Semarang with its prominent pentagonal fortress.]]

Semarang was handed by the [[Mataram Sultanate|Sultan of Mataram]] to the Dutch East Indies in 1678.<ref name="EVNI 1919 740-4" /> The city was pictured as a small settlement with a pious Muslim area called ''Kauman'', a Chinese quarter, and a Dutch fortress. The fortress has a pentagonal form with only one gate in the south and five monitoring towers to protect the Dutch settlement from rebellion actions, segregating the spaces between Dutch settlement and other areas.<ref>Purwanto, L. M. F. (2005). Kota Kolonial Lama Semarang. Dimensi Teknik Arsitektur, 33(1), 27-33</ref> In fact, the city of Semarang was only referred to the Dutch quarter while the other ethnic settlement were considered as villages outside the city boundary. The city, known as de Europeesche Buurt, was built in classical European style with church located in the centre, wide boulevards, streets and villas.<ref name="Pratiwo. 2005">Pratiwo. (2005).

Dimensi Teknik Arsitektur, 33(1), 27-33.</ref> the urban and architectural form of this settlement is very similar to the design principles applied in many Dutch cities.

Due to the long and costly Java War, there was not much funding from the Dutch East Indies government, and this affected Semarang's development. Most land in the area was used for rice cultivation and the only small improvement was the development of a surrounding fortress. Although less developed, Semarang is a fairly well organized city, in which urban activities were concentrated along the river and the settlement is linked to a market where different ethnic groups met to trade. The existence of the market, in the later years, become a primary element and a generator of urban economic growth.<ref name="Nas, P. J. M. 2002">Nas, P. J. M., & Pratiwo. (2002). Java and De Groote Postweg, La Grande Route, the Great Mail Road, Jalan Raya Pos’. Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land-en Volkenkunde, 158(4), 707–725.</ref>

After the departure of [[Herman Willem Daendels]], Napoleonic governor of Java, the Dutch reorganized Java into [[Residency (administrative division)|Residencies]], and Semarang became the seat of the new [[Semarang Residency]] in 1817. An important influence on urban growth was the Great Mail Road project in the 1847, which connected all the cities in the northern coast of Central and East Java and positioned Semarang as the trade centre of agricultural production.<ref name="Colombijn, F. 2002">Colombijn, F. (2002). Introduction; On the road. Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land-en Volkenkunde, 158(4), 595-617.</ref> The project was soon followed by the development of the [[Staatsspoorwegen|Staatsspoorwegen Railway]] and the connecting roads into the inner city of Semarang at the end of the 19th century.<ref name="Nas, P. J. M. 2002" /> Colombijn (2002)<ref name="Colombijn, F. 2002" /> marked the development as the shift of urban functions, from the former river orientation to all services facing the roads.

=== Modern city (1870–1922) ===
[[File:Coat of arms of Semarang (1827).svg|thumb|left|200px|Coat of Arms of Semarang during Dutch colonial era, granted in 1827.]]
The [[Dutch East Indies]]' mail and railway projects improved communication and transportation, bringing an economic boom to the city in the 1870s. Hospitals, churches, hotels, and mansions were built along the new main roads of Mataram Street, Bojongscheweg, and Pontjolscheweg.<ref name="Pratiwo. 2005" /> The Javanese quarters of town known as [[kampong]]s grew increasingly densely populated, reaching as many as 1000 inhabitants per [[hectare]] and degrading living conditions.<ref name="Cobban, J.

Karsten's approach to town planning emphasized its aesthetic, practical, and social requirements articulated in economic terms rather than purely racial ones.<ref name="Cote, J. 2004" />

Driven by economic growth and spatial city planning, the city had doubled in size and expanded to the south by the 1920s, creating a nucleus of a metropolis where multi-ethnic groups lived and traded in the city. The villages in the suburbs such as Jomblang and Jatingaleh steadily became the satellite towns of Semarang, more populated with a bigger market area. Before the invasion of Japan in 1942, Semarang had already become the capital of [[Central Java]] province, as the result of trade and industrial success and spatial planning.<ref name="Pratiwo. 2005" />

The [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] military occupied the city, along with the rest of Java, in 1942, during the [[Pacific War]] of [[World War II]]. During that time, Semarang was headed by a military governor called a Shiko, and two vice governors known as Fuku Shiko. One of the vice governors was appointed from [[Japan]], and the other was "chosen" from the local population. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

After [[Indonesian independence]] in 1945, Semarang became the capital of [[Central Java]] on 18 August 1945,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tidak Langsung 34, Ada 8 Provinsi yang Baru Dibentuk pada Awal Kemerdekaan - Semua Halaman - Bobo |url=https://bobo.grid.id/read/082180909/tidak-langsung-34-ada-8-provinsi-yang-baru-dibentuk-pada-awal-kemerdekaan |access-date=2020-08-14 |website=bobo.grid.id |language=id |archive-date=31 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231031133718/https://bobo.grid.id/read/082180909/tidak-langsung-34-ada-8-provinsi-yang-baru-dibentuk-pada-awal-kemerdekaan |url-status=live }}</ref> headed by Mr. Moch.Ichsan.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2011-05-05 |title=Daftar Walikota Semarang Sejak 1945 Hingga Sekarang |url=http://seputarsemarang.com/daftar-walikota-semarang-sejak-1945-sekarang-8660/ |access-date=2020-08-14 |website=Seputar Semarang |language=id |archive-date=17 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200717195955/http://seputarsemarang.com/daftar-walikota-semarang-sejak-1945-sekarang-8660/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Geography ==
Semarang is located on the northern coast of Java. The city of Semarang is one of the most important cities located on the north coast of Java and is the main hub connecting [[Jakarta]] and [[Surabaya]], and cities in the southern interior of Java [[Surakarta]] and [[Yogyakarta]]. Semarang City has a height ranging from {{cvt|2|m|feet}} below sea level up to {{cvt|340|m|feet}} above sea level with a slope of 0%–45%. Semarang City is a city that has a unique topographic condition in the form of a narrow lowland area and hilly areas extending from the west side to the east side of Semarang City. The city is located about {{cvt|558|km|mile}} east of Jakarta and {{cvt|312|km|mile}} west of Surabaya.

Lowland areas in Semarang City are very narrow. The lowland area in western Semarang only has a width of {{cvt|4|km|mile}} from the coastline, while in the eastern Semarang, the low-lying area has a width of {{cvt|11|km|mile}} from the coastline. This lowland area is a flood plain from the large rivers that flow in Semarang City, such as Kali Garang (West Flood Canal), Pengkol River, and Bringin River. This low-lying area stretches on the northern side of Semarang and covers almost 40% of the total area of Semarang. This lowland area is known as the lower town (Semarang Ngisor), as well as the center of the city's economic activity. Under these conditions, the lower city area is often hit by annual flooding and its peak during the rainy season. In a number of regions, especially North Semarang, floods are sometimes also caused by overflowing sea tides (tidal floods). The hilly area in Semarang stretches on the south side. These hills are part of a series of northern Java mountain ranges that stretch from Banten to East Java. The hilly area in the city of Semarang is known as the upper city (Semarang Dhuwur). This hilly region is also the upstream area of the big rivers that flow in the city of Semarang. The upper city area is also near [[Mount Ungaran]].

=== Climate ===
Semarang features a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Am''). The city features distinctly wetter and drier months, with June through August being the driest months. However, the average monthly rainfall does not fall below {{cvt|60|mm|inch}}, hence the tropical rainforest categorization. Semarang on average sees approximately {{cvt|2800|mm|inch}} of rain annually. Average temperatures in the city are relatively consistent, hovering around {{cvt|28|C}}. [[Diurnal temperature variation]] slightly increases in the dry season.

=== Semarang River and flood control ===
Like Singapore River, Semarang is constructing Semarang River at Banjir Kanal Barat (Garang River) near Karangayu Bridge. In the middle of July 2011, gardens in river banks and some traditional boats are available to use. The project will be finished in 2013 with river gardens, trotoars, garden lighting, water activities, art sites, sport sites and balconies and stairs for sightseeing.<ref>{{cite news |last=Isti |first=Bambang |url=http://suaramerdeka.com/v1/index.php/read/layar/2011/07/16/834/-Eloknya-Singapore-River-di-Banjirkanal-Barat |title=Eloknya Singapore River di Banjirkanal Barat |date=16 July 2011 |work=Suara Merdeka |access-date=28 December 2016 |language=id |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228195536/http://suaramerdeka.com/v1/index.php/read/layar/2011/07/16/834/-Eloknya-Singapore-River-di-Banjirkanal-Barat |archive-date=28 December 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>
In August 2011, a {{cvt|421|m|sigfig=3}} tunnel dodger at Kreo river has been finished and Jatibarang Dam construction can begin, with completion targeted for July 2013.

== Greater Semarang ==
Greater Semarang (known as ''Kedungsepur'') was initially defined by the government as Semarang city, [[Semarang Regency]], [[Salatiga]] city, [[Kendal Regency]], and [[Demak Regency]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Soetomo |first=Sugiono |url=http://www.isocarp.net/Data/case_studies/478.pdf |title=Urban Development as the interface of Regional Development from Below in central Java – Indonesia: the Case of Semarang Metropolitan |work=40th ISoCaRP Congress |publisher=[[International Society of City and Regional Planners]] |date=2004 |access-date=28 December 2016 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220551/http://www.isocarp.net/Data/case_studies/478.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> It was later extended to include the western part (12 districts only) of [[Grobogan Regency]]. Despite the definition, rural and urban cores remain distinct and have not amalgamated into a continuous urban sprawl as is the case in [[Jakarta metropolitan area|Greater Jakarta]].
