Hargeisa was founded as a watering and trading stop between the coast and the interior by the [[Isaaq Sultanate]]. Initially it served as a watering well for the vast livestock of the [[Isaaq]] clan that inhabited that specific region and later were joined by other Isaaq clans that currently inhabit Hargeisa. In 1960, the [[Somaliland Protectorate]] gained independence from the [[United Kingdom]] and as scheduled united days later with the [[Trust Territory of Somaliland]] (former [[Italian Somaliland]]) to form the [[Somali Republic]] on 1 July.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 2002 p.835">Encyclopædia Britannica, ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', (Encyclopædia Britannica: 2002), p.835</ref>  Up to 90% of the city was destroyed during the [[Isaaq genocide]], a state-sponsored campaign of violence during the [[Somaliland War of Independence]].

Hargeisa is situated in a valley in the [[Ogo Mountains|Galgodon]] (Ogo) highlands, and sits at an elevation of {{convert|4,377|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Home to [[rock art]] from the [[Neolithic]] period, the city is also a commercial hub for precious stone-cutting, construction, retail services and trading, among other activities.<ref name="Jubba"/>

==Etymology==
The town evolved in the latter half of the 1800s as a [[Qadiriyya]] settlement established by [[Sheikh Madar]], near a water-stop used by nomadic stock-herders on the way to the town of Harar. It proposes a possible derivation of the name "Hargeisa" from the sobriquet ''Harar as-sagir'', meaning "[[Harar]] the little"<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopaedia Britannica: A New Survey of Universal Knowledge |year=1957 |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica |page=967 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=caIRAQAAMAAJ&q=hargeisa+little+harar}}</ref><ref name="Encyclopaedia Aethiopica">{{cite journal | last =Ficadorey | first =Gianfranco | title =Ha | journal =Basic Reference | volume =3 | page =1032 | publisher =Thomson/Gale | location = NY, USA | year =2008 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=X38lxaUjm1MC&q=hargeisa+little+harar&pg=PA1032| isbn =9783447052382 }}</ref> According to historian Norman Bennett, Madar named the settlement Hargeisa or ''Little Harar'' since he aspired for it to emulate the city of Harar as a center for Islamic teachings.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bennett|first1=Norman|title=Leadership in Eastern Africa|date=1968|publisher=Boston University Press|page=70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=607jAAAAMAAJ&q=hargeisa+little+harar|access-date=14 July 2016}}</ref> Another etymological root for Hargeisa's name derives from the towns connection to the skins trade. Hargeisa has been a watering and trading stop between the coast and the interior, and chief amongst the goods traded were the hide skins procured from the interior to be processed in the settlement. In this etymological version, 'Hargeisa' is derived from ''hargageys'', which means "place to sell hides and skins" in [[Somali language|Somali]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Haji Mukhtar.|first1=M|title= Historical Dictionary of Somalia|date=2003|publisher=Scarecrow Press|pages=98}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Gabriel Schnitzer.|first1=J|title=Hides and Skins: World Production and International Trade |date=1927|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|pages=145}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TkQoAAAAMAAJ|title=Taḥaḍḍur fī al-waṭan al-ʻArabī (Institute of Arab Research and Studies)|date=1978|isbn=9789777287289 }}</ref>

==History==
===Prehistory===
[[File:Laas Geel.jpg|thumb|left|Rock art from the [[Laas Geel]] complex on the outskirts of Hargeisa.]]
Numerous [[cave painting]]s from the [[Neolithic]] period are found in the [[Laas Geel]] complex, on the outskirts of Hargeisa. During November and December 2002, an archaeological survey was carried out in the area by a French team of researchers. The expedition's objective was to search for rock shelters and caves containing stratified archaeological infills capable of documenting the period when production economy appeared in this part of Somaliland ({{Circa|[[5th millennium BCE|5th]]}} and 2nd millennium BCE). During the course of the survey, the French archaeological team discovered the Laas Geel [[rock art]], encompassing an area of ten rock alcoves (caves). In an excellent state of preservation, the paintings show human figures with their hands raised and facing long-horned, humpless [[cattle]].<ref name="African Archeology Volume 1 2003">The Journal of African Archeology Volume 1.2 (2003) Chapter 3</ref>

The rock art had been known to the area's inhabitants for centuries before the French discovery. However, the existence of the site had not been broadcast to the international community. In November 2003, a mission returned to Laas Geel and a team of experts undertook a detailed study of the paintings and their prehistoric context.

Somaliland generally is home to numerous such [[archaeological site]]s, with similar rock art and/or ancient edifices such as the [[Dhambalin]] rock art. However, many of these old structures have yet to be properly explored, a process which would help shed further light on local history and facilitate their preservation for posterity.<ref name="Hodd">Michael Hodd, ''East African Handbook'', (Trade & Travel Publications: 1994), p.640.</ref>

H. Swayne, a British soldier and explorer who traversed the Somali peninsula between the 1880-1890s wrote about Hargeisa in his journals:

<blockquote>This town is built some five hundred yards from the right bank of the Aleyadera nala, and at an elevation of thirty or forty feet above it. Round the place is a patch of jowari (sorghum) cultivation, two and a half miles long and a quarter of a mile broad. Quantities of livestock of all kinds graze on the low undulating hills for half a mile from the Aleyadera nala on either bank. Hargeisa is situated on two important caravan routes, one from Ogaden and the other from Harar. There are good direct camel-roads to [[Berbera]] and [[Bulhar]]. Supplies of rice, tobacco, and dates can sometimes be bought here in the trading season. Some four hundred people are employed looking after the jowari fields, and may be seen sitting on platforms, shouting and throwing stones to scare birds from the crops. There is abundance of good water in the bed of the river, and a masonry well has been built, and is kept in order by an Arab from Aden. The town is full of blind and lame people, who are under the protection of Sheikh Mattar and his mullahs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Seventeen Trips Through Somaliland and a Visit to Abyssinia|last=Carlos-Swayne|first=Harald|year=1900|pages=96}}</ref></blockquote>

===British Somaliland===
[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-3-179.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Women's market in Hargeisa, [[British Somaliland]] [[protectorate]].]]
In 1888, after signing successive treaties with the then ruling [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Sultan]]s and chiefs, the British established a [[protectorate]] in the region referred to as [[British Somaliland]] with [[Berbera]] becoming the capital.<ref>Hugh Chisholm (ed.), ''The encyclopædia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information'', Volume 25, (At the University press: 1911), p.383.</ref> The British garrisoned the protectorate from [[Aden Settlement|Aden]] in present-day [[Yemen]], and administered it from their [[British Indian Empire|British India]] until 1898. British Somaliland was then administered by the [[Foreign Office]] until 1905 and afterwards by the [[Colonial Office]].

The capital was moved from Berbera to Hargeisa, and the city was granted capital status in 1941. During the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], the protectorate was [[Italian invasion of British Somaliland|invaded by Italy]] in August 1940, but recaptured by the British in March 1941. In 1945 the British administration had grown weary of the influence ''[[sheikh|wadaads]]'' had wielded in the protectorate and moved to arrest several in Hargeisa. They had been deemed nuisances to implementing 'modern education' and agricultural reforms in Somaliland. Following their arrests on June 4, a mob formed and temporarily freed the imprisoned ''wadaads'' who were recaptured the next day. Religious leaders motivated the city's inhabitants and a crowd of several thousand rioters marched on the Hargeisa District Headquarters determined to free the imprisoned ''wadaads''. They were fired upon by the District Commissioner's troops with one dying and dozens imprisoned for trying to free the Sheikhs.<ref>{{cite book|title=British Somaliland An Administrative History, 1920-1960|first=Brock|last=Milman|year=2014|isbn=9780367868840|pages=138–139|publisher=Routledge}}</ref>

===Reconstruction===
After the collapse of the Somali central government and the unilateral declaration of independence of the Republic of Somaliland, a slow process of infrastructural reconstruction subsequently began in Hargeisa and other towns in the country.

Since 1991, Hargeisa has undergone a large-scale facelift. The renovations have been largely financed by local entrepreneurs, as well as Somali expatriates sending [[remittance]] funds to relatives in the region through some of the various Somali-owned money transfer operators.<ref name="Usrs">{{cite web|url=http://www.diaspora-centre.org/DOCS/UK_Somali_Remittan.pdf|title=UK Somali Remittances Survey|website=diaspora-centre.org|access-date=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617224947/http://www.diaspora-centre.org/DOCS/UK_Somali_Remittan.pdf|archive-date=17 June 2017}}</ref> Most of the destroyed residential and commercial buildings have since been reconstructed, with many newer structures erected. Single-storey buildings downtown are also progressively giving way to multi-storey [[Tower block|high-rises]].

== Climate ==
Hargeisa has a [[semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''BSh''). The city generally features very warm winters and hot summers. However, despite its location in the tropics, due to the high altitude Hargeisa seldom experiences either very hot or very cold weather, a trait rarely seen in semi-arid climates. The city receives the bulk of its rain between the months of April and September, averaging just over {{convert|400|mm|in}} of rainfall annually. Average monthly temperatures in Hargeisa range from {{convert|18|C|1|disp=or}} in the months of December and January to {{convert|24|C|1|disp=or}} in the month of June.

[[File:House of Representatives of the Republic of Somaliland.jpg|thumb|right|Meeting hall of Somaliland [[House of Representatives (Somaliland)|House of Representatives]].]]
Situated in the Maroodi Jeh region of Somaliland, Hargeisa is the seat of the Somaliland's [[Parliament of Somaliland|Parliament]], the presidential palace, and government ministries.<ref name="Hgc">[http://hargeisacity.50megs.com/ Hargeisa City Hall] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130116085417/http://hargeisacity.50megs.com/ |date=2013-01-16 }}.

According to a more recent December 2017 report from the [[Social Research and Development Institute]] (SORADI) based in Hargeisa, the city divided into eight sub-districts; being the [[31 May District|31 May]], [[26 June District|26 June]], [[Ahmed Dhagah District|Ahmed Dhagah]], [[Ahmed Moallim Haruun District|Ahmed Moallim Haruun]], [[Gacan Libaax District|Gacan Libaax]], [[Ibrahim Kodbuur District|Ibrahim Kodbuur]], [[Mohamoud Haibe District|Mohamoud Haibe]], and [[Mohamed Moge District]]s.<ref name="SORADI">{{cite report |title=Understanding the Hargeisa Local Council System 'Phase 2' |url=https://soradi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SORADI-IAAAP-Project-Final-Report.-IAAAP-19.1.18-1.pdf |publisher=Social Research and Development Institute |page=18 |date=December 2017 |access-date=27 October 2023}}</ref> This information is contradictory to an April 2003 report by the [[Famine Early Warning Systems Network]] (FEWS NET), which states only five sub-districts exist: being the 26 June, Ahmed Dhagah, Gacan Libaax, Ibrahim Kodbuur, and Mohamoud Haibe sub-districts, each having between four and six sub-sections of their own.<ref>{{cite report |last1=King |first1=Alexandra |last2=Mohamed |first2=Abdi Musa |last3=Addou |first3=Sidow Ibrahim |title=Hargeisa Urban Household Economy Assessment {{!}} February – March 2003 |url=https://fews.net/sites/default/files/documents/reports/so_baseline_urban_Hargeisa_en.pdf |publisher=[[Famine Early Warning Systems Network]] |page=14 |date=24 April 2003 |access-date=27 October 2023}}</ref> Presumably a redistricting occurred sometime between 2004 and 2017.<ref name="SORADI"/>

Hargeisa is the [[Finance|financial]] hub to many entrepreneurial industries ranging from finance, retail, imports/export warehouses to gem cutters, construction, food processing, textiles and livestock trading. 

In June 2012, the Partnership Fund for the private sector in Somaliland was launched at Hargeisa's Ambassador Hotel. Part of the larger Partnership for Economic Growth program, the initiative will see $900,000 [[United States dollar|USD]] allocated to 13 private local businesses, as well as the creation of 250 new full-time jobs, half of which are to be earmarked for youth and one third for women. The fund is expected to improve job opportunities for 1,300 entrepreneurs through ameliorated product distribution and investment in new technologies and processing facilities. Eligibility is determined through a competitive and transparent selection process overseen by the Partnership program, the [[Somaliland Chamber of Commerce]], and government officials.<ref name="Ultfgpftpsis">{{cite web|title=USAID launches the first grants program for the private sector in Somaliland |url=http://eastafrica.usaid.gov/en/USAID/Article/2909/USAID_launches_the_first_grants_program_for_the_private_sector_in_Somaliland |publisher=USAID |access-date=18 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218133422/http://eastafrica.usaid.gov/en/USAID/Article/2909/USAID_launches_the_first_grants_program_for_the_private_sector_in_Somaliland |archive-date=February 18, 2013 }}</ref>

Buses are the most commonly used form of public transportation in Hargeisa. They travel on a number of routes serving nearly all of the city's districts. Intercity bus services are also available, which connect Hargeisa to other major cities and towns across Somaliland, including [[Burao]], [[Berbera]] and [[Borama]].

With the growth of urban development, several new [[taxi]] companies have sprung up in Hargeisa.<ref name="Tcihcjet">{{cite news|last=Dahir|first=Barkhad|title=Taxi companies in Hargeisa create jobs, ease travel|url=http://sabahionline.com/en_GB/articles/hoa/articles/features/2012/12/20/feature-02|access-date=18 July 2013|newspaper=Sabahi|date=20 December 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515042900/http://sabahionline.com/en_GB/articles/hoa/articles/features/2012/12/20/feature-02|archive-date=15 May 2013}}</ref>

[[Hargeisa Taxi]] is another of the recent taxi firms based in Hargeisa. It has a fleet of four small compact cars and seven passenger minivans, in addition to around 19 other vehicles. GPS devices installed by the Sahal Technology firm allow the cab company's dispatch office to monitor its taxis to ensure that they travel within the speed limit. The office can also disable the vehicles online in the event of theft. Other new taxi firms serving Hargeisa include Dalhis Taxi and Marodi Jeh Taxi. Fares are inexpensive, costing between 15,000 and 18,000 [[Somaliland shilling]]s ($2–$3 USD) per ride,<ref name="Tcihcjet"/> the US dollar is also widely accepted alongside the local currency.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Following Mobile Money in Somaliland {{!}} Rift Valley Institute|url=http://riftvalley.net/publication/following-mobile-money-somaliland|access-date=2020-11-01|website=riftvalley.net}}</ref>
