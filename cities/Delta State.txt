'''Delta State''' is a [[States of Nigeria|state]] in the [[South South (Nigeria)|South-South geopolitical zone]] of [[Nigeria]]. Named after the [[Niger Delta]]—a large part of which is in the state—the state was formed from the former [[Bendel State]], on 27 August 1991. Bordered on the north by [[Edo State]], the east by [[Anambra State|Anambra]] and [[Rivers State|Rivers]] states, and that south by [[Bayelsa State]] while to the west is the [[Bight of Benin]] which covers about 160 kilometres of the state's [[coastline]]. The state was initially created with 12 local government areas in 1991, but was later expanded to 19 and now has 25 [[Local government areas of Nigeria|local government areas]]. Its capital city is [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]] which is located along the [[River Niger]] on the northeastern end of the state, while the state's economic center is the city of [[Warri]] on the southwestern coastline.

Of the [[States of Nigeria|36 states]], Delta is the [[List of Nigerian states by area|23rd largest in the area]] and [[List of Nigerian states by population|twelfth most populous]] with an estimated population of over 5.6 million as of 2016.<ref>{{cite web |title=Population 2006-2016 |url=https://nigerianstat.gov.ng/elibrary/read/474 |website=[[National Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria|National Bureau of Statistics]] |access-date=14 December 2021}}</ref> Geographically, the state is divided between the [[Central African mangroves]] in the coastal southwest and the [[Nigerian lowland forests]] in most of the rest of the state as a small portion of the [[Niger Delta swamp forests]] are in the far south. The other important geographical features are the [[River Niger]] and its distributary, the [[Forçados River]], which flow along Delta's eastern and southern borders, respectively; while fellow Niger distributary, the [[Escravos River]], runs through [[Warri]] and the coastal areas are riddled with dozens of smaller Niger distributaries that make up much of the western [[Niger Delta]]. Much of the state's nature contains threatened [[dwarf crocodile]], [[Grey parrot]], [[African fish eagle]], [[mona monkey]], and [[African manatee]] populations along with potentially extirpated populations of [[African leopard]] and [[Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lameed |first1=GA |title=Potential impact on biodiversity in kwale's forest reserve by power plant establishments |journal=African Journal of Food, Agriculture, Nutrition and Development |date=2009 |volume=9 |issue=30 |pages=1878–1900 |doi=10.18697/ajfand.30.1750 |s2cid=240141039 |url=https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajfand/article/view/50070 |access-date=19 December 2021|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name="Ogbe–Ijaw market" /> Offshore, the state is also biodiverse as there are populations of [[Lesser African threadfin]], [[crab]]s, and [[blue mussel]] along with various [[Cetacea|cetacean species]].<ref name="Ogbe–Ijaw market">{{cite journal |last1=Ijeomah |first1=HM |last2=Oruh |first2=EK |title=Wildlife based business activities in Ogbe–Ijaw market of Delta state, Nigeria |journal=Journal of Agriculture and Social Research |date=2015 |volume=12 |issue=2 |url=https://www.ajol.info/index.php/jasr/article/view/112825 |access-date=19 December 2021}}</ref>

What is now Delta State has been inhabited for years by various ethnic groups, including the [[Isoko people|Isoko]] and [[Eruwa language|Eruwa]] in the centre of the state; [[Ukwuani people|Ukwuani]] in the east; the [[Ika people|Ika]], [[Enuani dialect|Enuani]], and [[Olukumi people|Olukumi]] in the northeast; the [[Anioma people|Anioma]] in the northwest; and the [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]], [[Itsekiri people|Itsekiri]], and [[Urhobo people|Urhobo]], in the southwest. In the pre-colonial period, the now-Delta State was divided into various monarchial states like the [[Kingdom of Warri]] and [[Ughelli|Agbor Kingdom]] before the area became a part of the British [[Oil Rivers Protectorate]] in 1884. In the early 1900s, the British incorporated the protectorate (now renamed the [[Niger Coast Protectorate]]) into the [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate]] which later amalgamated into [[British Nigeria]]. However, colonial forces did not gain permanent control of modern-day Delta State until the 1910s, due to the uprisings of the [[Ekumeku Movement]]. Notably, Delta has one of the few parts of now-Nigeria to have been under French control as the UK leased the [[Enclaves of Forcados and Badjibo|enclave of Forcados]] to France from 1903 to 1930.

After independence in 1960, the area of now-Delta was a part of the post-independence [[Western State (Nigeria)|Western Region]] until 1963 when the region was split and the area became part of the [[Mid-Western Region, Nigeria|Mid-Western Region]]. In 1967, the [[Igbo people|Igbo]]-majority former [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Region]] attempted to secede as the state of [[Biafra]] and [[Midwest Invasion of 1967|invaded]] the Mid-Western Region in an attempt to capture [[Lagos]] and end the [[Nigerian Civil War|war]] quickly; Biafran forces were halted and eventually pushed back but briefly declared the captured Mid-Western Region (including now-Delta State) as the [[Republic of Benin (1967)|Republic of Benin]]. During the occupation there were widespread hostilities between the [[Biafra]]n forces and the mainly non-Igbo inhabitants of now-Delta State with [[Biafra]]n forces committing atrocities against ethnic [[Hausa people|Hausa]], [[Urhobo people|Urhobo]], and [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]] people; similarly, upon the liberation of the Mid-West, Nigerian forces committed the [[Asaba massacre]] against ethnic Igbos in [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]]. At the war's end and the reunification of Nigeria, the [[Mid-Western Region, Nigeria|Mid-Western Region]] was reformed until 1976 when it was renamed [[Bendel State]]. In 1991, Bendel State was split with the north becoming [[Edo State]] and the south becoming Delta State.<ref>{{cite web |title=This is how the 36 states were created |url=https://www.pulse.ng/news/local/nigerian-states-this-is-how-the-36-states-were-created/mdtnq3e |website=Pulse.ng |date=24 October 2017 |access-date=15 December 2021}}</ref>

Economically, Delta State is based around the production of [[crude oil]] and [[natural gas]] as one of the main oil-producing states in the country.<ref name=":3">{{cite web |last1=Akanbi |first1=Festus |title=As Anambra, Kogi Join Oil-producing States |url=https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2021/09/19/as-anambra-kogi-join-oil-producing-states/ |website=[[ThisDay]] |access-date=15 December 2021}}</ref> Key minor industries involve [[agriculture]] as the state has substantial [[oil palm]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], and [[cassava]] crops along with fishing and [[heliciculture]]. In large part due to its vast oil revenues, Delta has the [[List of Nigerian states by Human Development Index#2019|fourth highest]] [[Human Development Index]] in the country; however, disputes between oil companies and local communities along with years of systemic corruption have led to [[Conflict in the Niger Delta|hostilities]] that are often tied to the lack of development in host communities.<ref name=":4">{{cite web |title=Human Development Indices |url=https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/shdi/ |website=Global Data Lab |access-date=15 December 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Ebiri |first1=Kelvin |title=Oil-producing communities reek of poverty despite over N10t 13% derivation |url=https://guardian.ng/saturday-magazine/cover/oil-producing-communities-reek-of-poverty-despite-over-n10t-13-derivation/ |website=The Guardian |date=17 November 2019 |access-date=21 December 2021}}</ref>

== Geography ==
Delta State covers a landmass of about {{convert|18050|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, of which more than 60% is land. The state lies approximately between 5°00' and 6°45' E and 5°00' and 6°30' N.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ebewore|first=Solomon Okeoghene|date=2020-01-01|title=Rural Folks Perception of Suicide Drivers in rural communities of Delta State, Nigeria: Implications for Societal and Agricultural Security|journal=Open Agriculture|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|pages=50–62|doi=10.1515/opag-2020-0005|issn=2391-9531|doi-access=|s2cid=211253008 }}</ref> It is geographically located in [[Mid-Western Region, Nigeria|Nigeria's Midwest]], bounded in the north and west by [[Edo State]] for 350&nbsp;km (218 miles), the east by [[Anambra State|Anambra]], and [[Rivers State|Rivers]] States for about 93&nbsp;km and about 50&nbsp;km respectively, southeast by [[Bayelsa State]] across the Niger River for 17&nbsp;km and the Forçados River for 198&nbsp;km,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Delta {{!}} state, Nigeria|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Delta-state-Nigeria|access-date=2021-06-25|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> and on the southern extreme is the [[Bight of Benin]] which covers about 160 kilometres of the state's [[coastline]]. Delta State is generally low-lying without any remarkable hills. The state has a wide coastal belt inter-laced with [[Stream|rivulets]] and streams, which form part of the [[Niger Delta]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brief History of Delta State:: Nigeria Information & Guide |url=https://www.nigeriagalleria.com/Nigeria/States_Nigeria/Delta/Brief-History-of-Delta-State.html |access-date=2022-09-07 |website=www.nigeriagalleria.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Delta State Medium-Term Development Plan (DSMTDP) 2016 - 2019 |pages=22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Brief History of Delta State:: Nigeria Information & Guide|url=https://www.nigeriagalleria.com/Nigeria/States_Nigeria/Delta/Brief-History-of-Delta-State.html|access-date=2021-07-12|website=www.nigeriagalleria.com}}</ref>

=== Climate ===

An important characteristic of the Climate of Delta State is flooding.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Balogun |first1=Verere S. |last2=Onokerhoraye |first2=Andrew G. |date=2022-08-01 |title=Climate change vulnerability mapping across ecological zones in Delta State, Niger Delta Region of Nigeria |journal=Climate Services |language=en |volume=27 |pages=100304 |doi=10.1016/j.cliser.2022.100304 |issn=2405-8807|doi-access=free |bibcode=2022CliSe..2700304B }}</ref> The ecological attributes of Delta State also include heavy rainfall,  which makes the state, like other states in the Niger-Delta Nigeria to be regarded as lowland [[rainforest]], freshwater [[swamp]] and mangrove swamp.

== History ==
Delta State was defined out of the former [[Bendel State]] on 27 August 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-02-06|title=Seven sharp facts about Delta State|url=https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-47149731|access-date=2020-09-04|website=BBC News Pidgin}}</ref> The state was actualized following agitations for the realization of a separate distinct state by the peoples of the old Delta Province.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Alabi|first=Tope|date=2017-03-21|title=10 things we bet you didn't know about Delta State|url=https://www.informationnigeria.com/2017/03/10-things-bet-didnt-know-delta-state.html|access-date=2020-09-23|website=Information Nigeria|language=en-US}}</ref>  There was yet another state request proposed as "Anioma State<ref>{{Cite web |last=vanguard |date=2010-06-29 |title=Anioma people renew demand for separate state |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2010/06/anioma-people-renew-demand-for-separate-state/ |access-date=2022-09-18 |website=Vanguard News |language=en-GB}}</ref>" comprising the [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]] and [[Agbor]] Divisions of the old Midwest region.<ref name=":0" /> The then Military President, Gen.

The name "[[Bendel, Nigeria|Bendel]]" (Ben-Del) was coined from the old Benin and Delta Provinces of Western Region-Delta to reflect the integration of Benin and Delta provinces.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oseni|first=Z.

=== Politics ===
The State government is governed by an elected governor who works closely with members of the state's House of Assembly.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web |last=Oguntola |first=Tunde |date=2022-09-27 |title=2023: Next President, Govs Must Get Two-thirds Spread, Says INEC |url=https://leadership.ng/2023-next-president-govs-must-get-two-thirds-spread-says-inec/ |access-date=2023-02-24 |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Electoral system ===
The electoral system of each state is selected using a modified two-round system. To be elected in the first round, a candidate must receive the plurality of the vote and over 25% of the vote in at least two-thirds of the State local government Areas. If no candidate passes a threshold, a second round will be held between the top candidate and the next candidate to have received a plurality of votes in the highest number of local government Areas.<ref name="auto"/>
