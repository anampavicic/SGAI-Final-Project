'''Sagaing Region''' ({{langx|my|စစ်ကိုင်းတိုင်းဒေသကြီး}}, {{IPA-my|zəɡáɪ̯ɰ̃ táɪ̯ɰ̃ dèθa̰ dʑí|pron}}; formerly '''Sagaing Division''') is an [[administrative divisions of Myanmar|administrative region]] of [[Myanmar]], located in the north-western part of the country between latitude 21° 30' north and longitude 94° 97' east. It is bordered by India's [[Nagaland]], [[Manipur]], and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] states to the north, [[Kachin State]], [[Shan State]], and [[Mandalay Region]] to the east, Mandalay Region and [[Magway Region]] to the south, with the [[Ayeyarwady River]] forming a greater part of its eastern and also southern boundary, and [[Chin State]] and India to the west. The region has an area of {{convert|93,527|km2}}. In 1996, it had a population of over 5,300,000 while its population in 2012 was 6,600,000. The urban population in 2012 was 1,230,000 and the rural population 5,360,000.<ref>http://www.mrtv3.net.mm/newpaper/68newsm.pdf Page 3 Col 1</ref> The capital city and the largest city of Sagaing Region is [[Monywa]].

==History==
===0 - 1200 A.D===
[[File:Pyu city-states map.svg|thumb|180px|Pyu city in red]]

The [[Pyu people|Pyu]] were the first in recorded history to populate the area of Sagaing Region by the first century CE. The [[Bamar|Burmans]] first migrated into [[Upper Myanmar]] by ninth century CE. The area came under the [[Pagan Kingdom]] certainly by the middle of 11th century when the King [[Anawrahta]] (r. 1044–1077) founded the Pagan Empire, which encompasses the modern day Myanmar.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

===1287 - 1900 ===
[[File:Map of Taungoo Empire (1580).png|thumb|Map of Taungoo Empire in 1580 stretched from Manipur in the west to Cambodia in the east]]
After the fall of Pagan in 1287, the northwestern parts of Upper Myanmar came under the [[Sagaing Kingdom]] (1315–1364) ruled by Burmanized [[Shan people|Shan]] kings. The area was ruled by the kings of [[Ava Kingdom|Ava]] from 1364 to 1555 and the kings of [[Taungoo Dynasty|Taungoo]] from 1555 to 1752. [[Konbaung Dynasty]] (1752–1885), founded by king [[Alaungpaya]] in [[Shwebo]], became the last Burmese dynasty before the [[British Empire|British]] conquest of Upper Burma in 1885. The area became Sagaing Division after the Burmese independence in January 1948.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

In the aftermath of the [[2021 Myanmar coup d'état]], Sagaing Region, which is part of the [[Bamar people|Bamar]] homeland, emerged as a stronghold of resistance against military rule. [[Tatmadaw|Myanmar Armed Forces]] have engaged in significant military offensives throughout the region to quell resistance and intimidate local villagers. Sagaing Region has since become the site of several high-profile massacres by military forces, including the 2022 [[Let Yet Kone massacre]] and the 2023 [[Tar Taing massacre]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=Maung Shwe Wah |date=2023-03-11 |title=In Myanmar's heartland, new horrors from a junta struggling for control |url=https://myanmar-now.org/en/news/in-myanmars-heartland-new-horrors-from-a-junta-struggling-for-control |access-date=2023-03-11 |website=Myanmar NOW |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web |date=2022-11-23 |title=The Tabayin School Attack |url=https://www.myanmarwitness.org/reports/the-tabayin-school-attack |access-date=2023-03-02 |website=Myanmar Witness |language=en}}</ref>

==Transport==
[[Image:Sagaing3.jpg|thumb|[[Sagaing]]]]
Hemmed in by two great rivers of Myanmar, the [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]] and the [[Chindwin River|Chindwin]], river transport is a common way to move people and cargo. Much of the inland Sagaing Region relies on roads and rail in poor condition.

==Economy==
Agriculture is the chief occupation. The leading crop is [[rice]], which occupies most of the arable ground. Other crops include [[wheat]], [[sesame]], [[peanut]], [[pulses]], [[cotton]], and [[tobacco]]. The region being next to India, depends on the export import business from India. It is the gateway to India for Myanmar. Sagaing is Myanmar's leading producer of wheat, contributing more than 80% of the country's total production.  Important minerals include [[gold]], [[coal]], [[salt]] and small amounts of [[petroleum]]. Industry includes textiles, [[copper]] refining, gold smelting, and a [[diesel engine]] plant. The Region has many rice mills, [[edible oil]] mills, saw mills, cotton mills, and mechanized weaving factories. Local industry includes earthen pots, silverware, bronze-wares, iron-wares and [[lacquerware]].

Forestry is important in the wetter upper regions along the [[Chindwin River]], with [[teak]] and other hardwoods extracted. As in other parts of the country, [[reforestation]] is not effective enough to maintain [[sustainable forestry]]. Since the [[2021 Myanmar coup d'état]], [[illegal logging]] of teak and tamalan trees has surged in Sagaing Region, predominantly in key contested battlegrounds, including [[Kani Township|Kani]], [[Yinmabin Township|Yinmabin]], [[Kanbalu Township|Kantbalu]], [[Indaw Township|Indaw]] and [[Banmauk Township|Banmauk townships]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Frontier |date=2023-03-27 |title='No one can stop it': Illegal logging surges in Myanmar's conflict zones |url=https://www.frontiermyanmar.net/en/no-one-can-stop-it-illegal-logging-surges-in-myanmars-conflict-zones/ |access-date=2023-03-27 |website=Frontier Myanmar |language=en-US}}</ref> Both the Burmese military and resistance groups have profited from the illegal logging trade.<ref name=":0" /> Smugglers transport the wood to India in order to circumvent [[economic sanctions]], and use the [[Myanma Timber Enterprise]] to license the wood as being sourced from permitted areas.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-03-07 |title=From Taiwan to Turkey and beyond: How Deforestation Inc exposed the teak trade from Myanmar |url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/deforestation-inc/from-taiwan-to-turkey-and-beyond-how-deforestation-inc-exposed-the-teak-trade-from-myanmar/ |access-date=2023-03-27 |website=ICIJ |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Education==
{{see also|List of universities in Sagaing Division}}

Educational opportunities in Myanmar are extremely limited outside the main cities of [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]]. According to official statistics, less than 10% of primary school students in Sagaing Region reach high school.<ref name=cso-edu>{{cite web | url=http://www.etrademyanmar.com/STATS/s1701.htm | title=Education statistics by level and by State and Division | access-date=2009-04-09 | publisher=Myanmar Central Statistical Organization | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929022440/http://www.etrademyanmar.com/STATS/s1701.htm | archive-date=2011-09-29 }}</ref>

Sagaing Region has three national "professional" universities in the [[Monywa University of Economics]], [[Sagaing University of Education]] and the [[Sagaing Institute of Education]]. [[Monywa University]] is the main [[liberal arts]] university in the region. [[Sagaing Institute of Education]] also known [[Sagaing University of Education]] is the one of two senior universities of education in [[Myanmar]].

==Healthcare==
The general state of healthcare in Myanmar is poor. The military government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country's GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=108&subsecID=900003&contentID=254167 | title=PPI: Almost Half of All World Health Spending is in the United States | date=2007-01-17 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205231908/http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=108&subsecID=900003&contentID=254167 | archive-date=2008-02-05 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/06/28_Burma.shtml | title=Burma junta faulted for rampant diseases | date=2007-06-28 | author=Yasmin Anwar | publisher=UC Berkeley News}}</ref> Although healthcare is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment. Moreover, the healthcare infrastructure outside of [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]] is extremely poor. In 2003, Sagaing Region had less than a quarter of the number of hospital beds counted in [[Yangon Region]], with a similar size of population.<ref name=cso-hosp>{{cite web | url=http://www.etrademyanmar.com/STATS/s0413.htm | title=Hospitals and Dispensaries by State and Division | access-date=2009-04-11 | publisher=Myanmar Central Statistical Organization | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929022532/http://www.etrademyanmar.com/STATS/s0413.htm | archive-date=2011-09-29 }}</ref>
