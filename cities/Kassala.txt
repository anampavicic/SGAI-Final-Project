'''Kassala''' ({{langx|ar|كسلا}}) is the capital of the state of [[Kassala (state)|Kassala]] in eastern [[Sudan]].  In 2002 its population was recorded to be 957,000.<ref name="GeoHive">{{cite web |url=http://www.geohive.com/cntry/sudan.aspx?sub=y&diacrit=1 |access-date=2007-02-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021022644/http://www.geohive.com/cntry/sudan.aspx?sub=y&diacrit=1 |archive-date=2006-10-21 |title=GeoHive |url-status=dead }}</ref> Built on the banks of the [[Mareb River|Gash River]], it is a market city and is famous for its fruit gardens. Many of its inhabitants are from the [[Hadendoa|Hadendawa]] sub-tribe of the [[Beja people|Beja]] ethnic group.

The city was formerly a railroad hub, however, as of 2006 there was no operational railway station in Kassala and much of the track leading to and from the city has been salvaged or fallen into disrepair. Kassala's location along the main [[Khartoum]]-[[Port Sudan]] highway makes it an important trade center.

== History ==

=== Neolithic ===
The ancient settlement of [[Gash Group#Mahal Teglinos|Mahal Teglinos]] flourished here during the Early [[Gash Group]] phase (ca. 2800–2500 BC). Egyptian jars dating from this period have been found here.<ref>Manzo, A. (2017). Eastern Sudan in its setting: The archaeology of a region far from the Nile Valley. Oxford: Cambridge Monographs in African Archaeology, p. 35</ref> At that time, the inhabitants at Mahal Teglinos were already trading with [[Egypt]], [[Nubia]], and the southern [[Arabian Peninsula]].<ref name="Winchell Brass Manzo Beldados pp. 483–505">{{cite journal | last1=Winchell | first1=Frank | last2=Brass | first2=Michael | last3=Manzo | first3=Andrea | last4=Beldados | first4=Alemseged | last5=Perna | first5=Valentina | last6=Murphy | first6=Charlene | last7=Stevens | first7=Chris | last8=Fuller | first8=Dorian Q. | title=On the Origins and Dissemination of Domesticated Sorghum and Pearl Millet across Africa and into India: a View from the Butana Group of the Far Eastern Sahel | journal=African Archaeological Review | publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC | volume=35 | issue=4 | date=2018-11-10 | issn=0263-0338 | doi=10.1007/s10437-018-9314-2 | pages=483–505| pmid=30880862 | pmc=6394749 }}</ref>

Mahal Teglinos settlement continued after that, and also flourished during the late Gash Group phase (ca. 1900–1700 BC).<ref name="Winchell Brass Manzo Beldados pp. 483–505"/>

=== Modern ===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, the city was a key node in the west–east trade route, linking the coastal ports of [[Massawa]] and [[Suakin]] with the Sudan and farther west.<ref>Miran, Jonathan. "Red Sea Citizens." Indiana University Press, 2009. Page, 87</ref> The city was conquered by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] soldiers of [[Egypt]]ian [[viceroy]] [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] in 1840 during his military offensive into Sudan. In 1885, Kassala was subsequently captured by the [[Mahdist War|Mahdist]]s. In 1894, after the [[Battle of Kassala]] the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italians]] captured the city from the Mahdists. In 1897, the Kingdom of Italy returned Kassala to the [[Kingdom of Egypt]] in order to get international recognition of the Italian colony of [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]]. In 1899, Kassala fell under the purview of [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]] until Sudanese independence in 1956.

In July 1940, during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], Italian forces advancing from [[Italian East Africa]] forced the local British garrison to withdraw from Kassala.  The Italians then occupied the city with brigade-sized units:<ref>[http://www.centrorsi.it/notizie/images/stories/casssa/cassa%20nastro%20azzurro117.jpg Map showing in detail the Kassala occupation by Italians (within a green line)]</ref> on July 4, 1940 the Italians started their offensive with 2,500 men (and one brigade of cavalry) supported by 24 tanks, while to defend Kassala for Britain there were 1,300 colonial soldiers with their British officers who -after some initial heavy fighting- were easily defeated. The Italians later appointed as mayor of Kassala the future hero of Eritrean independence, [[Hamid Idris Awate]]. In mid-January 1941, the Italians withdrew from the city and a British garrison returned.

==Climate==
[[File:نهاية الخريف في كسلا - السودان.jpg|alt=Tree in Kassala|thumb|End of Rainy Seasons in Kassala]]

April through June marks the hottest period of the year, followed by the [[wet season]] from July through September, marked by higher humidity levels and intermittent rainfall. The rest of the year is very dry, with nearly no precipitation from November to March.<ref name="WMONormals"/>
