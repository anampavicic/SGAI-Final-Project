'''Da Lat''' or '''Dalat'''<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Dalat {{!}} Vietnam Tourism|url=https://vietnam.travel/places-to-go/central-vietnam/dalat|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200406102403/https://vietnam.travel/places-to-go/central-vietnam/dalat |archive-date=2020-04-06 |access-date=|website=Vietnam National Administration of Tourism}}</ref> ({{langx|vi|Đà Lạt}}; {{IPA|vi|ɗâː làːt̚|-|Da Lat.ogg|listen|help=no}}), is the capital of [[Lâm Đồng Province]] and the largest city of the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] region in [[Vietnam]]. The city is located {{convert|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level on the [[Langbian Plateau]]. Da Lat is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Vietnam.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vietnameasyrider.com/da-lat-the-city-you-should-not-miss-in-vietnam-1|title=Da Lat - The city you should not miss in Vietnam|website=vietnameasyrider.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://highlandsporttravel.com/blog/see-do-eat-guide-to-dalat-vietnams-city-of-eternal-spring-6.html|title=See, Do & Eat Guide to Dalat – Vietnam's City of Eternal Spring|website=highlandsporttravel.com}}</ref>

Da Lat's specific sights are [[pine]] woods and twisting roads full of [[tree marigold|marigold]] (Vietnamese: ''hoa dã quỳ'') and [[acacia dealbata|mimosa]] blossom in the winter. The city's [[temperate]] weather stands in contrast to Vietnam's otherwise [[tropical]] climate. Mist covering the valleys almost year-round leads to its name "[[City of Eternal Spring (disambiguation)|City of Eternal Spring]]". Residents and tourists have often said that Da Lat has all four seasons in one day: spring in the morning, summer at noon, autumn in the afternoon and winter at night, from the sunset to the sunrise.

With its year-round cool weather, Da Lat supplies huge amounts of temperate agriculture products for all over Vietnam, for example: [[cabbage]], [[cauliflower]], [[artichoke]], [[tea]], [[wine]], [[persimmon]], and [[coffee]]. Its flower industry produces three characteristic flowers: [[hydrangea]] (Vietnamese: ''cẩm tú cầu''), [[rose|Da Lat rose]], and [[golden everlasting]] (Vietnamese: ''hoa bất tử'').<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dalat Flowers : The Development of Flower Industry|url=https://www.dalattrip.com/dalat-flowers/|access-date=2022-02-19|language=en}}</ref> The confectionery industry offers a wide range of ''mứt'', a kind of fruit preserve that closely resembles [[varenie]], made from [[strawberry]], [[mulberry]], [[sweet potato]], and [[roselle_(plant)|roselle]].

Da Lat is also known as an area for scientific research in the fields of [[biotechnology]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Creating Technological Capability and Tourism Potential|url=https://www.dalattrip.com/creating-technological-capability-and-tourism-potential/|access-date=2022-02-19|language=en}}</ref> and [[nuclear physics]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-03-31|title=Vietnam resort town concerned nuclear reactor could hit tourism|url=http://www.thanhniennews.com/society/vietnam-resort-town-concerned-nuclear-reactor-could-hit-tourism-24996.html|access-date=2022-02-19|website=Thanh Nien Daily|archive-date=2022-02-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220219075124/http://www.thanhniennews.com/society/vietnam-resort-town-concerned-nuclear-reactor-could-hit-tourism-24996.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Da Lat is known regionally for avocado ice-cream, [[bánh tráng nướng]], and its large garment market, with a broad selection of cool-weather clothing.

==Name==
[[File:Petit Guide illustré de Dalat (Coat of Arms).svg | thumb|220x124px | left | Colonial coat of arms of Dalat]]
According to some sources, the name is derived from the acronym of the Latin phrase 'Dat Aliis Laetitiam Aliis Temperiem' ("It Gives Pleasure to Some, Freshness to Others"), which the French colonial government used in their official emblem of Da Lat. In reality, however, the name {{lang|vi|Đà Lạt}} is derived from the language of the local ethnic group [[Koho people|Lạt]] and its original meaning is "Stream of the Lạt", and the above acronym is in fact a [[backcronym]]. {{lang|vi|Đà Lạt}} or ''Đạ Lạch'' got its name from [[Koho language|Koho]] ''daa'' (“water”) + ''Laac'' (the indigenous people of Da Lat).

=== French era ===
[[File:Itinéraires touristiques autour de Dalat.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Da Lat in 1942]]
During the 1890s, explorers in the area (including the noted [[bacteriologist]] [[Alexandre Yersin]], protégé of the renowned French chemist [[Louis Pasteur]]), which was then part of the French colony of [[French Cochinchina|Cochinchina]], asked the French governor-general, [[Paul Doumer]], to create a resort center in the highlands, and the governor agreed. The original intended site for the [[hill station]] was Dankia, but Étienne Tardif, a member of the road-building expedition of 1898–99, proposed the current site instead. In 1907, the first hotel was built. Urban planning was carried out by [[Ernest Hébrard]].<ref>Crossette, Barbarạ ''The Great Hill Stations of Asia''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1998. pp 207-219.</ref>

[[File:A street of Da Lat ca. 1925.jpg|thumb|left|A street of Da Lat ca. 1925]]

Many Europeans used to travel up to Da Lat to escape the heat of the lower coastal areas and Mekong delta. 

The French endowed the city with villas and boulevards, and its Swiss charms remain today. Hébrard included the requisite health complex, golf course, parks, schools, and homes but no industry. The legacy of boarding schools where children from the whole of Indochina were taught by French priests, nuns, and [[expatriate]]s still existed as late as 1969. In 1929, the [[Christian and Missionary Alliance]] established [[Dalat International School|a school]] which later shortly relocated to Bangkok, Thailand, due to the Vietnam War and has been located in [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]], since the 1970s. There were seminaries of [[Jesuit]]s (such as [[Pius X Pontifical College]]) as well as other orders.

In the 1920s and 1930s, there were ideas of making Da Lat the 'summer capital', 'administrative capital', and 'federal capital' of [[French Indochina]]. During the [[French Indochina in World War II|World War II]], Governor-general [[Jean Decoux]] (r. 1940–1945) supported this project.{{sfnp|Jennings|2011|page=228–230}}

=== South Vietnamese era ===
{{Further|Battle of Da Lat}}

The [[South Vietnam]]ese [[Vietnamese National Military Academy|National Military Academy]] graduated its first class of future leaders in 1950. There was also an aviation school at [[Cam Ly Airport]].

In the mid-1950s, the [[Vietnamese Scout Association]] established their national training grounds at Da Lat.

The [[Battle of Da Lat|only major involvement]] Da Lat had during the [[Vietnam War]] was during the 1968 [[Tet Offensive]]. Fierce battles raged from January 31 to February 9, 1968. Most of the fighting took place between the South Vietnamese/American MP units stationed in Da Lat and the [[Viet Cong|Việt Cộng]] (VC) forces. Defeats and victories alternated between the two during the sporadic-yet-intense battles.

=== Communist Vietnam ===
[[File:Da Lat Nuclear Research Institute 01.JPG|thumb|Da Lat Nuclear Research Institute (''Viện Nghiên cứu Hạt nhân Đà Lạt'')]]

South Vietnam eventually fell under communist rule and was merged with the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]], where the Socialist Republic of Vietnam was constructed and also experienced the [[Đổi Mới]] reforms along with the rest of the country.

During the communist era of Vietnam (the Socialist Republic of Vietnam), places like Da Lat as well as [[Hội An|Hoi An]] and [[Da Nang]] were regularly regarded as amongst the most romantic tourist places in Vietnam.<ref>{{Cite news|last=VnExpress|title=Da Lat, Hoi An among Vietnam's most romantic places for Valentine's Day |url=https://e.vnexpress.net/news/places/da-lat-hoi-an-among-vietnams-most-romantic-places-for-valentines-day-4426803.html|access-date=2022-02-19|newspaper=[[VnExpress|VnExpress International]]|language=en}}</ref> Da Lat has also become a hub for [[:vi:Viện Nghiên cứu Hạt nhân Đà Lạt|nuclear research]] and biotechnology.

==Geography==

Da Lat is located {{convert|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level on the [[Langbian Plateau]] in the southern parts of the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] (in Vietnamese: ''Tây Nguyên'').

Da Lat features a [[subtropical highland climate]] under the [[Köppen climate classification]] (''Cwb'') and is mostly mild year round.

Da Lat's year-round temperate weather, standing in contrast to central & southern Vietnam's otherwise-tropical climate, has led it to be nicknamed the “City of Eternal Spring”.<ref name="lpviet">Lonely Planet Vietnam, (Lonely Planet, 2007), {{ISBN|1-74059-677-3}}, pp. 290–305.</ref> The average temperature is {{convert|14|to|23|C|F}}. The highest temperature ever in Da Lat was {{convert|31.5|C|F}}, and the lowest was {{convert|-0.6|C|F}}.<ref name=climate /> Mist covers the adjoining valleys almost year-round. Its temperate climate also makes it ideal for agriculture. Indeed, Da Lat is renowned for its [[orchid]]s, [[rose]]s, vegetables, and fruits. There are nascent wine-making and flower-growing industries in the region.

There are two separate seasons in Da Lat. The rainy season lasts from May to October, and the dry season lasts from November through April of the next year. The average annual precipitation is 1,750&nbsp;mm.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Da Lat|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/149338/Da-Lat|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=22 September 2012|year=2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Nature|url=http://www.lamdong.gov.vn/en-US/home/DaLatcity/Pages/Nature.aspx|access-date=2020-07-22|website=www.lamdong.gov.vn}}</ref>

[[File:Rock garden at Da Lat Station.jpg|thumb|right|A Vietnamese [[Hòn Non Bộ]] in front of the [[Art Deco]]-influenced [[Da Lat Railway Station]] of vernacular French architecture.]]
The [[architecture]] of Da Lat was mostly influenced by the style of the French during [[Colonialism|colonial]] period. [[Da Lat Railway Station]], built in 1938, was designed in the [[Art Deco]] architectural style by French architects Moncet and Reveron, although it incorporates the high, pointed roofs characteristic of the ''Cao Nguyen'' communal buildings of Vietnam's Central Highlands. The three gables represent an art deco version of Normandy's [[Gare de Trouville-Deauville|Trouville-Deauville Station]].<ref name="deauville">{{cite web|title=Paradise by the Dashboard Light|url=http://enroute.aircanada.com/en/articles/paradise-by-the-dashboard-light|work=Air Canada enroute|access-date=22 September 2012|author=Samantha Coomber|date=1 January 2008|archive-date=28 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228194417/http://enroute.aircanada.com/en/articles/paradise-by-the-dashboard-light|url-status=dead}}</ref> The station's unique design — with its roofs, arching ceiling, and colored glass windows — earned it recognition as a national historical monument in 2001.<ref name="ann-lilparis">{{cite web|url=http://www.asianewsnet.net/news.php?sec=10&id=4134|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615153924/http://www.asianewsnet.net/news.php?sec=10&id=4134|url-status=usurped|archive-date=2011-06-15|publisher=Asia News Network|author=Minh Thu|title=Little Paris charms visitors|date=2009-02-22|access-date=2010-07-16}}</ref><ref name="footprintvn">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/vietnamhandbook00cole|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/vietnamhandbook00cole/page/252 252]|title=Vietnam handbook|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|year=2002|isbn=978-1-903471-31-9|author=John Colet, Joshua Eliot|access-date=2010-07-28}}</ref>

Of particular note is the unconventional architecture of the [[Hang Nga guesthouse|Hằng Nga guesthouse]], popularly known as the “Crazy House”. Described as a “fairy tale house”, its overall design resembles a giant [[banyan]] tree, incorporating sculptured design elements representing natural forms such as animals, mushrooms, spider webs and caves. Its architecture, consisting of complex, organic, non-rectilinear shapes, has been described as [[Expressionist architecture|expressionist]]. Its creator, Vietnamese architect Dang Viet Nga (also known as Hằng Nga), who holds a PhD in architecture from [[Moscow State University]], has acknowledged the inspiration of [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[Spanish people|Spanish]] architect [[Antoni Gaudí]] in the building's design. Visitors have variously drawn parallels between the guesthouse and the works of artists such as [[Salvador Dalí]] and [[Walt Disney]].<ref name="untrvdest">{{cite web|title=The Crazy House|url=http://www.unusual-travel-destinations.com/Crazy_House.html|work=Unusual Travel Destinations|publisher=Unusual-Travel-Destinations.com|access-date=24 September 2012|author=Fida Wild|year=2009–2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626161621/http://www.unusual-travel-destinations.com/Crazy_House.html|archive-date=26 June 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="globe">[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/article639415.ece Madame Hang Nga's Crazy House].

It was used as a summer mansion for President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] and following presidents of the Republic of Vietnam until 1975. The Second Mansion was built in 1933 as the summer mansion for the Governor of French Indochina Jean Decoux. Built in 1933–1938, the Third Mansion was the residence of Emperor Bao Dai and his family.
