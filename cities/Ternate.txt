'''Ternate''', also known as the '''City of Ternate''', is the 
[[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|city]] with the largest population in the province of [[North Maluku]] and an island in the [[Maluku Islands]], [[Indonesia]]. It was the ''de facto'' provincial capital of North Maluku before [[Sofifi]] on the nearby coast of [[Halmahera]] became the capital in 2010. It is off the west coast of Halmahera, and is composed of five islands: Ternate, the biggest and main island of the city, and [[Moti Island|Moti]], [[Mount Hiri|Hiri]], Tifure and Mayau (the latter two constitute the [[Batang Dua Islands]], together with the small ofshore islets of Makka, Mano and Gurida). In total, the city has a land area of 162.20 square kilometres and had a total population of 185,705 according to the 2010 census,<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 205,001 according to the 2020 census,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> with a density of 1,264 people per square kilometre; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 204,920 (comprising 104,128 males and 100,792 females).<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Ternate Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.8271)</ref> It is the biggest and most densely populated city in the province, as well as the economic, cultural, and education center of North Maluku, and acts as a hub to neighbouring regions. It was the capital of the [[Sultanate of Ternate]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, and fought against the [[Sultanate of Tidore]] over control of the [[spice trade]] in the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]] before becoming a main interest to competing European powers.

==History==
{{See also|Sultanate of Ternate}}
=== Early history ===
Maluku is mentioned in ''[[Nagarakretagama]]''. The term originally denoted the spice-producing islands of North Maluku, of which Ternate became the dominant one. The Ternate Kingdom was previously known as the Kingdom of Gapi.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Media|first=Kompas Cyber|date=2021-05-01|title=Sejarah Berdirinya Kerajaan Ternate Halaman all|url=https://www.kompas.com/stori/read/2021/05/01/172900179/sejarah-berdirinya-kerajaan-ternate|access-date=2021-08-04|website=KOMPAS.com|language=id}}</ref> Moluccan tradition says that there was an exodus of people moving out of [[Halmahera]] around 1250 due to political conflicts.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Citra Daerah Kota Ternate (ANRI)|url=https://www.anri.go.id/download/naskah-sumber-arsip-citra-daerah-kota-ternate-dalam-arsio-1586349829}}</ref><sup>:4</sup> The settlement founded by people from Halmahera was first situated close on the hillside of the [[Gamalama]] mountain and named Tobona. During this time, Tobona was ruled by a tribal chief with the title of ''Momole''.<ref name=":2" /><sup>:4</sup> This period was characterized by several smaller tribal settlements around Gamalama which were founded afterwards, such as [[Foramadiahi]] being established further downhill, while Sampalu, and [[Fort Kastela|Gamlamo]] were founded along the coast. These settlements also had their own ''Momole'' and were nominally independent from each other.<ref name=":2" /><sup>:4</sup>

In 1257, Tobona gathered all the ''Momole'' from other villages for a meeting, who all agreed to choose [[Cico of Ternate|Cico]], the chief of Sampalu village, as the collective ruler of Ternate. Cico may correspond to Kaicil Mashur Malamo, who was the first ruler according to other traditions and was a son of the Arab Jafar Sadik, who is claimed to be the father of the founding kings of Ternate, [[Sultanate of Tidore|Tidore]], [[Sultanate of Bacan|Bacan]] and [[Sultanate of Jailolo|Jailolo]]. This political four-division had a great symbolic role. Cico replaced his title with ''Kolano'', which means "king".<ref name=":2" /><sup>:4</sup> The capital of the kingdom was first in Sampalu village, but moved to Formadiahi during the reign of Kaicil Siale (1284–1298).<ref name=":2" /><sup>:4</sup> Under Kaicil Ngara Malamo (1304–1317), Ternate expanded its influence and conquered neighbouring islands.<ref name=":2" /><sup>:5</sup> Ngara Malamo was succeeded by Patsyarangan Malamo (1317–1322) and later Sidang Arif Malamo (1322–1331). During this time, Ternate started to interact with [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Arab people|Arab]] traders, especially from [[Malacca]] and [[Java]]. Ternate became a major port city and center of the spice trade in the Moluccas region, competing with its rival, Tidore. Some of the foreign traders eventually created the foundations of the Chinese and Arab communities in the city today.<ref name=":2" /><sup>:5</sup>

Around 1322, Arif Malamo initiated the Moti Agreement, which was a result of discussions between the rulers in Moluccas about trade and standardization of government structures. As a result of this agreement, the Moluccas had relatively peaceful times of over the next twenty years and trade flourished.<ref name=":2" /><sup>:6</sup> However, Arif was succeeded by Kaicil Tulu Malamo, who revoked the agreement as he thought it limited his expansionist ambitions. Ternate conquered neighbouring islands like the [[Sula Islands Regency|Sula Islands]] and [[Seram Island]] over the course of the 1400s.<ref name=":2" /><sup>:6</sup>

In the midst of this expansionist era, Ternate officially became an Islamic sultanate during the reign of [[Zainal Abidin of Ternate|Zainal Abidin]] (1468–1500) and supplemented the ''Kolano'' title with that of sultan. It was during this time that a period of [[Islamization]] began. Abidin also changed the traditional Moluccan government structure into a more Islamic one, including the foundation of the ''Jolabe'', a council made up of Islamic clerics that would advise the sultan on religious matters. This structural and titular change was also adopted by Tidore and Bacan.<ref name=":2" /><sup>:7</sup>

Ternate and [[Tidore]] were the world's major producer of [[clove|cloves]], from which their rulers became among the wealthiest and most powerful sultans in the Indonesian region. Much of their wealth was used to fight each other. Until the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] completed the colonization of Maluku in the 19th century, the sultans of Ternate ruled an empire that periodically claimed at least nominal influence in magnitude as [[Ambon Island|Ambon]], [[Sulawesi]], and [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]].<ref name="travel">{{cite book | last =Witton | first =Patrick | title =Indonesia | publisher =Lonely Planet | year =2003 | location =Melbourne | pages =821–822 | isbn=1-74059-154-2 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Concise History of Islam|last1=Syed|first1=Muzaffar Husain|last2=Akhtar|first2=Syed Saud|last3=Usmani|first3=B D|publisher=Vij Books India Pvt Ltd|year=2011|isbn=9789382573470|pages=332|oclc=868069299}}</ref>

The peak of the Ternate sultante's power came near the end of the 16th century under Sultan [[Babullah of Ternate|Baabullah]], when it exerted influence over most of the eastern part of Sulawesi, the Ambon and [[Seram Island|Ceram]] area, the [[Banda Islands]], [[Solor Islands]], [[Mindanao]], and parts of Papua. It engaged in a fierce competition for control of its periphery with Tidore. According to historian [[Leonard Andaya]], Ternate's "dualistic" rivalry with Tidore was a dominant theme in the early history of the Maluku Islands.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historical Atlas of Indonesia|last=Cribb|first=Robert|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9780203824610|pages=103|oclc=7385581041}}</ref>

As a result of its trade-dependent culture, Ternate was one of the earliest places in the region to which [[Islam]] spread, originating from Java in the late 15th century,<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Federspiel|first=Howard M.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Qf39DpguysC|title=Sultans, Shamans, and Saints: Islam and Muslims in Southeast Asia|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8248-3052-6|pages=52}}</ref> though Islamic influence in the area can be traced further back to the late 14th century.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Azra|first=Azyumardi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePSkf-DHu5YC&pg=PA26|title=Islam in the Indonesian World: An Account of Institutional Formation|publisher=Mizan Pustaka|year=2006|isbn=978-979-433-430-0|pages=39–40|author-link=Azyumardi Azra}}</ref> The faith was restricted to Ternate's small ruling family before spreading to the rest of the population.<ref name=":1" />[[File:Willem Blaeu00.jpg|thumb|Early map of northern [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] made during the [[Age of Discovery]].

The first Europeans to arrive at Ternate were part of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] expedition of [[Francisco Serrão]] coming from [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]]; they were shipwrecked near Ceram and rescued by local residents. Sultan [[Bayan Sirrullah|Abu Lais]] of Ternate heard of their plight and brought them to Ternate in 1512 when he saw a chance to ally himself with a powerful foreign nation. The Portuguese were allowed to build [[Fort Kastela]] on the island.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Portuguese and Luso-Asian legacies in Southeast Asia, 1511-2011|last=Jarnagin|first=Laura|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|year=2012|isbn=9789814345507|location=Singapore|chapter=The fortress of Sao Joao Baptista on Ternate|oclc=864556584}}</ref>

Relations between the Ternateans and Portuguese were strained from the start; an outpost far from Europe generally only attracted the most desperate and avaricious figures. The poor behaviour of the Portuguese combined with feeble attempts at Christianisation strained relations with Ternate's Muslim ruler,<ref name="RICKLEFSp24">{{cite book | last =Ricklefs | first =M.C. | title =A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300, 2nd Edition | publisher =MacMillan | year =1993 | location =London | isbn = 0-333-57689-6 | page =24 }}</ref> as did their efforts to monopolise the spice trade and dominate local politics.<ref name="travel"/> In 1535 King [[Tabariji]] was deposed and sent to [[Goa]] by the Portuguese.

When Sultan [[Hairun]] was murdered and his head displayed on a pike in 1570, the Muslim Ternateans rebelled against the Portuguese who were besieged in their castle. Their captain was Dom Álvaro de Ataíde, and [[:pt:Belchior Vieira de Ternate|Belchior Vieira de Ternate]] distinguished himself in the defense until the garrison was forced to capitulate to Sultan [[Babullah of Ternate|Babullah]] in 1575, who made the castle his palace.<ref name="travel"/> Ambon and Tidore became the new centres for Portuguese activity in Maluku.

In 1579, the sultan entertained the English adventurer and circumnavigator [[Francis Drake]], who had little interest in buying cloves, as his ship, the ''[[Golden Hind]]'', was too full of gold that he had raided from [[Spanish treasure fleet|Spanish treasure ships]] to carry cloves.<ref name="travel"/>[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Lijfwacht van de Sultan van Ternate TMnr 60039372.jpg|thumb|Sultan of Ternate's guard.|left]]As the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] battles in the [[Indian Ocean]] against Muslim powers continued, Ternate became a site of interest, particularly for the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], who had gained much information about [[maritime Southeast Asia]] from the [[Sultanate of Aceh]]. [[Kurtoğlu Hızır Reis]], the Ottoman admiral, intended to reach both Java, [[Borneo]] and Ternate but was engaged in battle and outnumbered against the Portuguese fleet in [[Sumatra]].

Spanish and Dutch traders competing for control over the lucrative clove trade were caught up in the competition between Ternate and Tidore. The Dutch eventually became the ruling power, though for a long time their influence was limited, and the sultanates are still in place today.<ref name="travel"/> [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] forces captured the former Portuguese fort from the Ternateans in 1606 and deported the Ternate sultan and his entourage to [[Manila]],<ref>{{cite book |author= Peter Borschberg |year= 2015 | title = ''Journal, Memorials and Letters of Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge.

For the Ternatean rulers, the Dutch were a useful, if not particularly welcome, presence that gave them military advantages against Tidore and the Spanish. Ternate expanded its territory and strengthened its control over the periphery particularly under [[Hamza of Ternate|Hamzah]]'s rule (r. 1627–1648). Dutch influence over the kingdom was limited, though Hamzah and his successor, Sultan [[Mandar Syah]] (r. 1648–1675) ceded some regions to the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) in exchange for helping control rebellions. The Spanish abandoned Ternate and Tidore in 1663; when they abandoned Ternate, some of the people accompanied the Spanish in their retreat to the Philippines; about 200 families of mixed Mexican-Filipino-Spanish and Papuan-Indonesian-Portuguese descent left.<ref>Zamboangueño Chavacano: Philippine Spanish Creole or Filipinized Spanish Creole?

Some mixed people chose to stay in Ternate, Indonesia, though they were persecuted and went through [[Islamization]] by a resurgent sultanate. In the 18th century, Ternate was the site of a VOC governorship, which attempted to control all trade in the northern Moluccas.{{Citation needed|date=May 2022}}

By the 19th century, the spice trade had declined substantially, and the region was less central to the Netherlands colonial state, but the Dutch maintained a presence in the region to prevent another colonial power from occupying it. After the VOC was [[Nationalization|nationalised]] by the Dutch government in 1800, Ternate became part of the government of the Moluccas (''Gouvernement der Molukken''). Ternate was [[Invasion of the Spice Islands|captured and occupied]] by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] in 1810 before being returned to Dutch control in 1817. In 1824, it became the capital of a residency (administrative region) covering Halmahera, the entire west coast of [[New Guinea]], and the central east coast of Sulawesi. By 1867 all of Dutch-occupied [[New Guinea]] had been added to the residency, but its region was gradually transferred to Ambon (Amboina) before being subsumed into it in 1922.{{Citation needed|date=May 2022}}

=== 20th century–present ===
Like the rest of Indonesia, Ternate was occupied by [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces during [[World War II]]; eastern Indonesia was governed by the navy. After Japan surrendered in August 1945 and Indonesia declared independence, Ternate was reoccupied in early November 1945 by Allied forces who intended to return Indonesia to Dutch control. After World War 2, Ternate gained city status on 10 December 1946,<ref name=":2" /><sup>:18</sup> but was demoted to a district on 30 March 1965. It regained its city designation on 11 March 1981.<ref name=":2" /><sup>:19</sup> The sultanate still exists but with no power, and the titular rulers only act as cultural figures.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Media|first=Kompas Cyber|date=2021-05-08|title=Raja-Raja Kerajaan Ternate Halaman all|url=https://www.kompas.com/stori/read/2021/05/08/200303079/raja-raja-kerajaan-ternate|access-date=2021-08-04|website=KOMPAS.com|language=id}}</ref>

Ternate became part of [[Maluku (Indonesian province)|Maluku]] when Indonesia became independent. There was some violence in Ternate during the [[Maluku sectarian conflict|1998–2000 sectarian conflict]] across the Maluku islands.<ref name="travel"/> After the split of the new North Maluku province, it was assigned as the ''de facto'' capital of the province until 2010, when [[Sofifi]] was chosen. However, Sofifi still lacked infrastructure and city status, and today most activity in the province is still conducted in Ternate.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-06-24|title=Bermasalah Selama 22 Tahun Jadi Ibu Kota Baru, Persoalan di Sofifi Mau Diselesaikan!|url=https://www.industriproperti.com/daerah/bermasalah-selama-22-tahun-jadi-ibu-kota-baru-persoalan-di-sofifi-mau-diselesaikan/|access-date=2021-08-04|website=Www.IndustriProperti.Com|language=id-ID}}</ref>

==Governance==

=== Administration ===
At the time of the 2010 census, Ternate city (which includes seven neighbouring islands and islets as well as the main island of Ternate) was divided into seven [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]], but in 2018 an eighth district (Ternate Barat) was created in the west of the island from part of the Pulau Ternate District. The districts are tabulated below with their areas (in square kilometres) and their populations during the 2010<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011"/> and 2020 censuses,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021"/> together with the official estimates as at mid 2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Ternate Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.8271)</ref> Five of these districts are on the island of Ternate, and the remaining three each consist of a smaller neighbouring island or (in the case of Pulau Batang Dua District) islands. The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, the number of [[administrative village]]s in each district (all classed as urban ''kelurahan''), and its post code.
