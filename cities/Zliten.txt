==Name==
The name is derived from the name of the Isliten tribe, an old branch of the Nafzawa Berbers. Members of this tribe used to live in Libya and Tunisia, but are also known to have lived as far west as Morocco. They are mentioned by [[Leo Africanus]] in the 16th century as living in western Libya.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyanddescr02porygoog/historyanddescr02porygoog_djvu.txt Description of Africa]</ref>

==Education==
Zliten is home to one of Libya's most renowned [[Islamic]] universities,  ''Al-Jamiaa Al-Asmariya Al-Islamiya'' (Arabic:  الجامعة الأسمرية الإسلامية i.e. [[Al-Asmariya Islamic University]]). It includes a number of faculties; Faculty of Arts, Faculty of Sciences, Faculty of Economics and Political Sciences, Faculty of Dentistry and Mouth Surgery, and Faculty of Education. There is also a higher vocational training center covering various engineering fields.

==Economy==
Zliten has several modern [[banking institution]]s, a major shopping center and the Zliten Hotel, the city's top accommodation for tourists. In 2001, the Libyan Government proposed a number of state company projects for which [[joint ventures]] would be considered. These included an expansion of [[Arab Cement Company]]’s (ACC) [[cement]] plant in Zliten valued at $169 million.<ref>P. Mobbs 2001 p. 19.1</ref> In February 2005, the [[initial public offering]] of shares in the formerly state-owned ACC resulted in the sale of 60% of the company. ACC proposed to build a second 1-Mt/yr-capacity cement production line at its Zliten plant.<ref>P. Mobbs 2005 p.25.1</ref> Arab Union Contracting Co. (AUCC) commissioned a 1.2-Mt/yr-capacity [[Clinker (cement)|cement clinker]] plant near Zliten in December 2004; commercial production began in September 2005. AUCC began a [[feasibility study]] for the construction of a second clinker production line at its production facility.<ref>''Tripoli focuses on lack of cement supply'': (2005) ''Middle East Economic Digest'', v. 49, no. 26, p. 25</ref> In 2004, construction began on extending a seawater [[desalination]] plant in Zliten with a total capacity of {{convert|10000|m3|acre.ft}} per day using the [[multi-stage flash distillation]] process.<ref>M. Ashour (2004) p.216</ref>

==History and culture==
[[Image:- צלאת בושאיף.jpg|thumb|The Slat Abn Shaif Synagogue, Zliten, before WWII]]
There are many ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sites in Zliten, such as the coastal Villa of Omira ('Darbuk Omira' ) where several impressive mosaics were discovered, and the Castle in Al-Jumaa. The town also contains the [[Mausoleum]] and [[Mosque]] of [[Abd As-Salam Al-Asmar]], Mosque of Abu-Minjal, Mosque of Albaza and many other mosques. There is some fine Arabic [[calligraphy]] in [[sandstone]] on top of the outer pillars of the building saying ''al-mulk-'illah'' ("Everything to [[Allah]]").<ref>A. Ham p.148</ref> The town is famous for its olives, palm trees and citrus fruits along beautiful coastal shores. The [[Slat Abn Shaif Synagogue]] ({{langx|he|בית הכנסת צלאת בן שאיף}}) in Zliten was a historic [[synagogue]] and [[Lag Ba'omer]] pilgrimage site for [[Libyan Jews]]. It was over 900 years old and was destroyed in the 1980s by Gaddafi and replaced by apartments.

On Friday, 24 August 2012 the shrine of Sidi Abdul-Salam Al-Asmar Al-Fituri suffered extensive damage at the hands of violent [[Salafists]]. Muhammad al-Madkhali, a cleric of the [[Madkhalism]] movement,<ref>Mansoor Jassem Alshamsi, ''Islam and Political Reform in Saudi Arabia: The Quest for Political Change and Reform'', pg. 111.

Recent work on the region (dating between 2003 and 2017) using Google Earth imagery has identified 278 certain or potential archaeological sites within Zliten. The majority of these sites were determined as structures or enclosures, and their purpose, for most, interpreted as related to agricultural activities which the primary land use today. These 278 sites recorded in the  [http://eamena.arch.ox.ac.uk/ EAMENA](Endangered Archaeology in the Middle East and North Africa) database of the Zliten area. In this database, 170 sites were marked as in good condition, 50 in fair condition, 24 sites in poor condition, 15 in very bad and 16 recorded as completely destroyed, (with 3 in unknown conditions). Although this work was undertaken as recently as 2017, the developments in Libya, the political and economic situation affect both the management and very survival of Libya's ancient sites. Archaeological sites, as in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan do not comply to militant revolutionaries' aims, they are thus expendable and can/or in some cases 'must' be destroyed (https://www.nature.com/news/cultural-heritage-save-libyan-archaeology-1.16781). The EAMENA aim to track these sites and their condition while the ([https://www.societyforlibyanstudies.org/ Society of Libyan Studies]) publish reports aiming to promote Libyan archaeology, history and environment.

===Rubb===
Zliten has a proliferation of [[date palm]]s that yield what is considered by many to be the best ''rubb'' (date juice) in Libya.{{Citation needed|reason=statement contains opinion|date=January 2013}} ''Tarbuni'' is often served with the most famous local dish ''[[asida]]'', made from flour, boiled with salt, and eaten with olive and date juice. ''Asida'' is usually served as a quick meal for cold nights in winter. It is usually reserved to commemorate important religious occasions such as the birth of the [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]].<ref>''[[Mawlid al-Nabi]]'', the birth of Muhammad, is celebrated on the twelfth day of ''[[Rabi al-Awwal]]''. {{Cite book|author=Esposito, John L.|author-link=John Esposito|year=2003|chapter=Mawlid al-Nabi|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/oxforddictionary00bada/page/198 198]|isbn=978-0-19-512558-0|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/oxforddictionary00bada/page/198}}</ref> ''Asida'' is also the celebratory dish of choice for [[Tripolitania]]n families when a child is born.<ref>A.

During the [[2011 Libyan Civil War]], Zliten was contested between forces loyal to Gaddafi, and opposition fighters who were trying to seize the strategically located city to allow them to advance to the capital, Tripoli.
