'''Moreno Valley''' is a city in [[Riverside County, California]], United States, and is part of the Riverside–San Bernardino–Ontario metropolitan area. It is the second-largest city in Riverside County by population and one of the [[Inland Empire]]'s population centers. The city's population was 208,634 at the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]].<ref name="quif"/> Moreno Valley is also part of the [[Greater Los Angeles|greater Los Angeles area]].

The city derived its name from the small community of Moreno, which became part of the city of Moreno Valley when the city was incorporated in 1984. Frank E. Brown, one of the founders of the community of Moreno in 1882, declined to have the town named after him, but to honor him, the town was named Moreno, Spanish for ''brown''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gudde |first1=Edwin G |title=California Place Names; A Geographical Dictionary |date=1949 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley|page=224}}</ref>

==History==
===Indigenous period===
The Moreno Valley area was first inhabited 2,300 years ago. There are at least 200 prehistoric archaeological locations within the city. The majority of the sites are milling stations - where chaparral seed was the dominant milling activity. Rock art, consisting of [[pictographs]], and [[petroglyphs]] are present - though most of the petroglyphs in Moreno Valley consist of [[boulders]] with "cupules",  or cup-shaped holes pecked into them.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pe.com/articles/chacon-821942-bird-singing.html|title=Moreno Valley filmmakers explore Native American culture with 'We Are Birds'|date= December 28, 2016|newspaper=[[Press Enterprise]]|first=Stan |last=Lim|access-date=March 6, 2017}}</ref>

===Spanish & Mexican periods===
[[File:Portrait of Juan Bautista de Anza (Painted by Fray Orci; 1774, Mexico City).jpg|thumb|left|Famed Spanish explorer [[Juan Bautista de Anza]], whose expedition came through the area in 1774.]]
Spanish scouts initially came across descendants of the [[Shoshone]], and [[Luiseño]] tribes; although other groups, such as the [[Serrano (people)|Serrano]] and [[Cahuilla]] were in the area. The late prehistoric [[Luiseño]] and [[Cahuilla]] were semi-sedentary, meaning that they wintered in villages, then spread out in family groups during the spring and summer months to harvest seeds and acorns.<ref>{{cite web|title=Environmental Impact Report City of Moreno Valley General Plan Vol. 1|url=http://www.moreno-valley.ca.us/city_hall/general-plan/06gpfinal/ieir/eir-tot.pdf|website=moreno-valley.ca.us|access-date=April 9, 2015}}</ref>

Spanish scouts blazed a number of trails in the area, including the [[Anza Trail]], which runs through the [[Edgemont, Riverside County, California|Edgemont]] area of present-day Moreno Valley.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moval.gov/resident_services/mv-history.html|title=Moreno Valley History}}</ref>

===Post-Conquest period===
When California was admitted to the [[United States]] as a state in 1850, Americans began to move into the area. The [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]-to-[[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] route of [[John Warren Butterfield|John Butterfield]]'s [[Overland Mail Company]] passed through it. Some farmers began to occupy the area, relying upon water from Frank E. Brown's Bear Valley Land and Water Company. Beginning in 1883, the company collected and pumped water from Bear Valley in the [[San Bernardino Mountains]] to the north. The area first acquired its current name, Moreno Valley, at this time, referring to Frank Brown (''moreno'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "brown" or "brunet").<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sep 25, 1960, page 55 - The San Bernardino County Sun at Newspapers.com |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/51559515/ |access-date=2024-06-10 |website=Newspapers.com |language=en}}</ref> In 1899, the city of [[Redlands, California|Redlands]] won a lawsuit in which the city claimed [[eminent domain]] over the Bear Valley water. The resulting loss of service forced most of the area's inhabitants to move.

====Incorporation and growth====

By 1984, the population was 49,702 (compared to 18,871 residents in 1970).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moreno-valley.ca.us/community/about.shtml|title=About Moreno Valley|access-date=April 29, 2015}}</ref> The state economic boom fueled the construction of new houses and businesses, leading to a push for the area to [[incorporation (municipal government)|incorporate]] as a city. Although similar measures had failed previously in 1968 and 1983, the measure to form the city of Moreno Valley was approved by the area's voters in 1984. On December 3, 1984, the communities of Edgemont, Sunnymead, and Moreno united along with nearby areas to form the general law city of Moreno Valley. The first city council was also elected in 1984. It was composed of [[Bob Lynn]], Judith A. Nieburger, Steven Webb, J. David Horspool (first Mayor Pro Tem), and Marshall C. Scott (first Mayor). The city seal and motto were adopted the following year.

====March Air Reserve Base====
In November 2008, DHL announced it was leaving the U.S. market and would shut its operation associated with March Air Field in January 2009.<ref>"Inland airports' dream of cargo hubs grounded," Press-Enterprise newspaper, Thursday, November 20, 2008</ref>

===21st century===
On February 13, 2007, the city council passed, by a vote of 4–1, a resolution christening the eastern half of the city (roughly from Lasselle Street to Gilman Springs Road) "Rancho Belago", a [[pastiche]] of Spanish and Italian words.<ref>{{cite web |department=Resolution No. 2007-14 |quote=Item G2 - Establishment of  "Rancho Belago" as a Community Name for the area generally east of Lasselle Street within the City of Moreno Valley |publisher=City of Moreno Valley, California |title=Minutes of February 13, 2007 City Council Meeting|access-date=September 23, 2016 |url=http://www.moreno-valley.ca.us/city_council/archive/07_agendas/021307_minutes.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Area sounds 'bella' to some.

==Geography==

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|51.5|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|51.3|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.2|sqmi|km2}} of it is water.

[[File:Moreno Valley-Kitching view.jpg|thumb|Southern Moreno Valley, viewed looking south down Kitching Street]]
Moreno Valley is located at a geographic crossroad. To the east lies the [[San Gorgonio Pass]] and [[Coachella Valley]]; to the south are [[Lake Perris]], [[Perris, California|Perris]], and the [[San Jacinto Mountains]]; to the north are the [[San Bernardino Valley]] and [[San Bernardino Mountains]]. To the west lies neighboring [[Riverside, California|Riverside]]. It is relatively close to Ontario International Airport.

One of the most visible geographical features in Moreno Valley is [[Box Springs Mountain]]. This mountain at the northwest end of the city rises over the city, providing a concrete landmark. The section of the mountain that faces the city has a large letter "M" constructed upon it. This was built privately at the encouragement of the city council, which argued it would foster unity. The letter is located on public land and is maintained entirely by charity. The letter had lights installed on December 3, 2005, to celebrate Moreno Valley's 21st anniversary of its incorporation. The completion of the repairs of heavy damage to the letter, due to extreme rain the year before. The mayor at that time, Bonnie Flickinger, has said that the citizens liked it that way and that the council would try to get it to light up regularly. Between December 2, 2009, and December 6, 2009, Moreno Valley, along with Edison lit up the letter in celebration of the city's 25th anniversary. Several [[Eagle Scout rank (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] projects have been dedicated to maintaining the "M".
