==History==
The area of the modern city of Kishiwada was within ancient [[Izumi Province]]. The city has been settled since ancient times, and has numerous ''[[kofun]]'' [[burial mound]]s including the [[Mayuyama Kofun]]. During the [[Nanboku-chō period]], [[Kusunoki Masahige]] assigned his general Wada Haruji to govern an area called "Kishi" in Izumi Province in 1337. The Kishiwada "shōen", or landed estate, appears in documents from around 1400. The settlement developed into a [[jōkamachi|castle town]] during the [[Sengoku period]], as it occupied a very strategic location, approximately half way in-between the cities of [[Osaka]] and [[Wakayama (city)|Wakayama]] and just south of the port of [[Sakai, Osaka|Sakai]]. It is located on the Kishu Kaido, the main route connecting the capital area of Japan with [[Kii Province]], and its coastal location was important for transportation from the eastern [[Shikoku]] to [[Settsu Province]] and [[Kyoto]]. [[Kishiwada Castle]], was rebuilt by [[Koide Hidemasa]] at its present site in 1597. Under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] it was the center of [[Kishiwada Domain]], which was ruled by the Okabe clan from 1640 to the [[Meiji Restoration]]. In 1703, the city began its Danjiri festival.

The town of Kishiwada was official founded on within Hine District with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. On April 1, 1896, the area became part of [[Sennan District, Osaka]]. It was promoted to city status on November 1, 1922 as the 87th city to be founded in Japan and the 3rd in Osaka. On April 1, 2002, Kishiwada became a [[Special cities of Japan|Special city]] with increased local autonomy.

==Government==
Kishiwada has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 24 members. Kishiwada contributes two members to the [[Osaka Prefectural Assembly]]. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Osaka 18th district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]]. 

==Economy==
Since the Edo period, [[cotton]] has been cultivated throughout the city, and cotton cloth and cotton yarn have been spun. The textile industry has been the center of the industry since modern times, but many factories have disappeared due to competition by overseas products. In 1966, the city began reclaiming its coastal areas to build [[industrial park]]s and to attract heavy industry. Kishiwada became famous for its glass lens production, peaking around the year 1980 with about 70 lens factories.

Kishiwada has 24 public elementary schools, 12 public middle schools and two high schools operated by the city government and three public high school operated by the Osaka Prefectural Department of Education.
