'''Nowshera''' ({{Langx|ur|{{nq|نوشہرہ}}}}; {{audio|Nowshera.ogg|pronunciation}}; {{langx|ps|نوښار}}, ''pr.'' ''Nowkhār'' {{audio|PK_Nowshera.ogg|pronunciation}})  is the capital city of [[Nowshera District]] in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] [[Provinces of Pakistan|province]] of [[Pakistan]]. It is the [[Largest cities of Pakistan|78th largest city]] in Pakistan and [[List of cities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by population|ninth largest city]] in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Located in the [[Valley of Peshawar]], Nowshera lies on the [[Kabul River]], and is approximately {{convert|27|mi|km}} east of the provincial capital [[Peshawar]], along the [[Grand Trunk Road]].<ref name="IGI">{{cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V18_423.gif|title=Imperial Gazetteer2 of India, Volume 18, page 417 -- Imperial Gazetteer of India -- Digital South Asia Library|website=dsal.uchicago.edu}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The local [[Pashto]] name of the city is ''Nowkhār'' ({{lang|ps|نوښار}}), which means "New City".{{citation needed|date= October 2022}} It was translated into [[Dari Persian]] and [[Urdu]] as ''Nowshehra'' ({{lang|ur|نوشہرہ}}), which is a word with the same meaning.{{citation needed|date= October 2022}}

==History==
{{See also|Battle of Nowshera}}
[[File:British era building in Nowshera.jpg|thumb|British-era Taj Cinema building in Nowshera]]
Nowshera was developed during the Afghan [[Durrani Empire]]. The [[Battle of Nowshera]] was fought in March 1823 between the forces of [[Pashtuns]] with support from [[Azim Khan]] [[Barakzai]], [[Durrani]] governor against the [[Sikh Khalsa Army]] of [[Ranjit Singh]].<ref name=" Singh">Ganda Singh (1986) ''Maharaja Ranjit Singh: First Death Centenary Memorial''. Nirmal Publishers</ref> The battle was a decisive victory for the [[Sikh Empire]] against Afghans and led to their occupation of the [[Peshawar Valley]].<ref name="Greenwood">[[Joseph Greenwood]] (1844) ''Narrative of the late Victorious Campaigns in Afghanistan: under General Pollock; with recollections of seven years' service in India''. London: H. Colburn.</ref>

The city came under British rule in 1849. During [[British Raj|British rule]], Nowshera was a town and cantonment [[tehsil]] of the Peshawar District (later [[Peshawar Division]]). The town was on the route of the [[North Western Railway (British India)|North-Western Railway]] and Grand Trunk Road. During the [[Sepoy Mutiny]] in 1857, the town did not see any bloodshed as the native garrison had been peacefully disarmed by the British and had remained loyal. The population according to the 1901 census of India was 9,518.

The Imperial Gazetteer of India described the cantonment as follows:<ref name="IGI"/>

{{Quote|The cantonment stretches along the right bank of the Kābul river on a sandy plain, 3 miles in diameter, and is surrounded by low hills on all sides except the north, which is open towards the river. The garrison now consists of one British infantry regiment, two Native cavalry and four infantry regiments, a mountain battery, and a bearer corps, belonging to the Peshāwar division of the Northern Command. The Kābul river is crossed by a permanent bridge of boats, whence roads lead to [[Mardan|Mardān]] and [[Charsadda|Chārsadda]]. The iron road and railway bridge across the river was opened on December 1, 1903. The village of Naushahra Khurd, west of the cantonment, and the large village of Naushahra Kalān, on the north bank of the Kābul, are both outside cantonment limits. The headquarters of the Naushahra ''tahsīl'', with the police station, are in the former, 3 miles from the cantonment. The town contains a Government dispensary and a vernacular middle school, maintained by the District board.}}

The Kakakhels are a prominent Syed clan of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa. Their roots reach to Hazrat Ali bin Ismail bin Imame-Jafer Sadiq. Kakakhels are descendants of the Islamic Sufi (wali) Syed Kastir Gul (also known as Kaka Sahib), and Sheikh Rahamkar - a student of Sheikh Hazrat Akhun Adeen/Adyan Seljuki. Kastir Gul was affectionately known as "Kakasahib", and his descendants are known as Kakakhels - meaning "the sons of Kakasahib". The clan originated in a small village known as "Kakasaib" in Nowshera. (It is a matter of debate whether Kaka Khels qualify as a Pashtun tribe as they are a family group with affiliation to one progenitor, Kaka Sahib &ndash; but it is not known if he was a Pashtun &ndash; Mian or Miah are the descendants of Kaka Sahib.){{Citation needed|date=February 2022}}
