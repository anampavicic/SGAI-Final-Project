{{nihongo|'''Fujinomiya'''|富士宮市|Fujinomiya-shi}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] located in central [[Shizuoka Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. {{As of|2019|07|01}},  the city had an estimated [[population]] of 132,507 in 56,655 households,<ref>[http://www.city.fujinomiya.lg.jp/municipal_government/llti2b000000gquf-att/llti2b000000gqxe.pdf Fujinomiya City official statistics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220219075253/http://www.city.fujinomiya.lg.jp/municipal_government/llti2b000000gquf-att/llti2b000000gqxe.pdf |date=2022-02-19 }} {{in lang|ja}}</ref> and a [[population density]] of 340 persons per km². The total area of the city is {{convert|388.99|sqkm|sqmi}}.

==History==
The city name comes from the former shrine name of [[Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha]], "Fujinomiya".<ref>About the name of Fujinomiya City (Fujinomiya City Home Page) [http://www.city.fujinomiya.shizuoka.jp/municipal_government/llti2b0000000tlx.html 富士宮市の名前について（富士宮市HP）] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013023138/http://www.city.fujinomiya.shizuoka.jp/municipal_government/llti2b0000000tlx.html |date=2014-10-13 }}</ref> It is an ancient settlement that developed as a prosperous ''toriimae-machi'' (town in front of [[torii]]) of Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha, where the [[Fuji clan]] served as the [[high priest]] of the shrine. Nearby is the sanctuary of [[Taiseki-ji]] temple, founded in 1290 by [[Nikkō Shōnin]] as the headquarters of [[Nichiren Shōshū]] Buddhism.

Fujinomiya is closely related to Mount Fuji,<ref>{{Cite web|title=地域プライド調査|url=http://www.mlit.go.jp/kokudokeikaku/souhatu/h17seika/6pride/06_monka_05itiran1.pdf|website=Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (国土交通省)}}</ref> and was located in the crossroad of Ōmiya and Murayamaguchi mountain pilgrimage trails. During the [[Kamakura period]], the hunting event [[Fuji no Makigari]] arranged by [[shogun]] [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] was held in the ancient region of [[Fujino, Shizuoka|Fujino]], where the [[Revenge of the Soga Brothers]] incident also took place. These events were disseminated as historical materials such as ''Ōrai Mono'' (historical primary education textbooks created mainly in the form of letters), and as the subject of entertainment such as [[kabuki]], [[noh]], and [[Jōruri (music)|''jōruri'']].

Fujinomiya was a [[shukuba|post town]] (fortified during the [[Sengoku period]]) on the primary route connecting Suruga with [[Kai Province]]. During the [[Edo period]], the area was ''[[tenryō]]'' territory under direct control of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. British consul Sir [[Rutherford Alcock]] made the first recorded ascent on Mount Fuji by a non-Japanese person from Fujinomiya in 1860. During the cadastral reform of the early [[Meiji period]] in 1889, the area was reorganized into Omiya Town and eight villages with [[Fuji District, Shizuoka]].

On 1 June 1942, the modern city was established with the merger of Omiya town with neighboring Fujioka village. The city expanded by annexing neighboring Fujine village in 1955, and Kitayama, Shiraito, Kamiide and Ueno villages in 1956.

From 1987, [[Aum Shinrikyo]] had their headquarters in the city.

The most recent merger was on 23 March 2010, when the town of [[Shibakawa, Shizuoka|Shibakawa]] (from [[Fuji District, Shizuoka|Fuji District]]) was merged into Fujinomiya.

==Geography==
Fujinomiya is located in central Shizuoka Prefecture on an upland plateau on the foothills and lower slopes of Mount Fuji, with an altitude ranging from {{cvt|35|to|3336|m}}. The average temperature is {{cvt|15.6|C}}. Much of the city lies within the borders of [[Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park]].  Fujinomiya is known as one of the main starting points for climbing trips to [[Mount Fuji]], the summit of which is partly within the borders of the city. As with most of Shizuoka Prefecture, the area enjoys a warm maritime climate with hot, humid summers and mild, cool winters.
